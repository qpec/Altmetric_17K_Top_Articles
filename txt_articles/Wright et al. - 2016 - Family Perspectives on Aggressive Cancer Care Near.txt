IMPORTANCE Patients with advanced-stage cancer are receiving increasingly aggressive
medical care near death, despite growing concerns that this reflects poor-quality care.
OBJECTIVE To assess the association of aggressive end-of-life care with bereaved family
members’perceptions of the quality of end-of-life care and patients’goal attainment.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Interviews with 1146 family members of Medicare
patients with advanced-stage lung or colorectal cancer in the Cancer Care Outcomes
Research and Surveillance study (a multiregional, prospective, observational study) who died
by the end of 2011 (median, 144.5 days after death; interquartile range, 85.0-551.0 days).
EXPOSURES Claims-based quality measures of aggressive end-of-life care (ie, intensive care
unit [ICU] admission or repeated hospitalizations or emergency department visits during the
last month of life; chemotherapy �2 weeks of death; no hospice or �3 days of hospice
services; and deaths occurring in the hospital).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Family member–reported quality rating of “excellent” for
end-of-life care. Secondary outcomes included patients’goal attainment (ie, end-of-life care
congruent with patients’wishes and location of death occurred in preferred place).
RESULTS Of 1146 patients with cancer (median age, 76.0 years [interquartile range, 65.0-87.0
years]; 55.8% male), bereaved family members reported excellent end-of-life care for 51.3%.
Family members reported excellent end-of-life care more often for patients who received
hospice care for longer than 3 days (58.8% [352/599]) than those who did not receive
hospice care or received 3 or fewer days (43.1% [236/547]) (adjusted difference, 16.5
percentage points [95% CI, 10.7 to 22.4 percentage points]). In contrast, family members of
patients admitted to an ICU within 30 days of death reported excellent end-of-life care less
often (45.0% [68/151]) than those who were not admitted to an ICU within 30 days of death
(52.3% [520/995]) (adjusted difference, −9.4 percentage points [95% CI, −18.2 to −0.6
percentage points]). Similarly, family members of patients who died in the hospital reported
excellent end-of-life care less often (42.2% [194/460]) than those who did not die in the
hospital (57.4% [394/686]) (adjusted difference, −17.0 percentage points [95% CI, −22.9 to
−11.1 percentage points]). Family members of patients who did not receive hospice care or
received 3 or fewer days were less likely to report that patients died in their preferred location
(40.0% [152/380]) than those who received hospice care for longer than 3 days (72.8%
[287/394]) (adjusted difference, −34.4 percentage points [95% CI, −41.7 to −27.0 percentage
points]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among family members of older patients with fee-for service
Medicare who died of lung or colorectal cancer, earlier hospice enrollment, avoidance of ICU
admissions within 30 days of death, and death occurring outside the hospital were associated
with perceptions of better end-of-life care. These findings are supportive of advance care
planning consistent with the preferences of patients.

P
atients with advanced-stage cancer receive aggressive
medical care at the end of life,1 despite increasing evi-
dence that high-intensity treatments may not be associ-
ated with better patient quality of life, outcomes, or caregiver
bereavement.2 The National Quality Forum and the American
Society of Clinical Oncology have jointly endorsed several in-
dicatorsofoverlyaggressiveend-of-lifecare(developedbyEarle
et al3), including repeated hospitalizations, emergency depart-
ment visits, or admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) within
the last month of life, patient receipt of chemotherapy within
2 weeks prior to death, and late or absent hospice referrals.4
The end-of-life care measures of the National Quality
Forum and the American Society of Clinical Oncology are in-
tegratedintotheSociety’
sQualityOncologyPracticeInitiative5
and will likely become more important because the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act mandates public report-
ing of quality metrics and has linked incentive and penalty
payments to similar indicators (eg, the Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services Oncology Care Model).6 Improving end-
of-life care offers an opportunity to improve the dying expe-
rience of patients with cancer, more effectively use resources,7
and potentially prolong survival.8
Few studies have examined whether these aggressive end-
of-life care measures reflect patients’preferences or bereaved
family members’perceptions and expectations of the quality
of end-of-life care. In this study, we assessed the relationship
between aggressive end-of-life care and family member–
reported quality ratings of end-of-life care using data from the
Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS)
Consortium.9Wealsoexaminedpatientgoalattainment,which
was based on (1) whether patients treated with aggressive care
near death received care that was congruent with their prefer-
ences and (2) if their death occurred in their preferred place.
Methods
Data Sources
Data came from the CanCORS and CanCORS II studies linked
to Medicare claims from 2003 through 2011. As described
previously,9,10 CanCORS enrolled patients newly diagnosed
with lung or colorectal cancer during 2003 through 2005 from
5 regions (northern California; Los Angeles County, Califor-
nia;NorthCarolina;Iowa;andAlabama)and5integratedhealth
systems. Trained staff interviewed participants or their fam-
ilyinEnglish,Spanish,orChineseusingcomputer-assistedtele-
phone interview software (1) approximately 4 to 6 months af-
ter cancer diagnosis, (2) 1 year after diagnosis (for patients alive
at the time of the first interview), and (3) 5 to 7 years after di-
agnosis(forpatientsalive1yearafterdiagnosis).Thestudypro-
tocol was approved by institutional review boards at all par-
ticipatingsitesandallparticipantsprovidedinformedconsent.
For this analysis, a family member or close friend of the
deceased patient was interviewed after the patient’
s death
about the patient’
s treatment preferences,11 symptoms near
death, end-of-life wishes, preferred place of death, the qual-
ity of end-of-life care, and location of death. If the patient was
deceased at the initial study contact, the next-of-kin was in-
vited to participate. Patients who were alive for the baseline
interview were asked to identify a primary family member or
friend “familiar with your care since diagnosis” and a second-
ary respondent (in case the first could not be reached). Be-
cause 95% of interviews were completed by family (defined
as spouse or partner, child, other relative, or friend), we will
hereafter refer to respondents as family members.
We measured the intensity of end-of-life care received by
participants enrolled in the traditional fee-for-service Medi-
care plan by obtaining claims data with approval from the Cen-
ters for Medicare & Medicaid Services privacy board. Poten-
tially eligible enrollees were linked using a common matching
algorithm based on Social Security number, date of birth, and
sex,12 which matched 81.5% of CanCORS enrollees aged 65
years or older to Medicare data.
Study Population
The CanCORS participants who were diagnosed or experi-
enced advanced lung or colorectal cancer recurrence, died by
2011, were aged 65 years or older, and continuously enrolled
in Medicare parts A and B fee-for-service for 3 months or lon-
ger before death were included.
Outcome Variables
We examined family member–reported ratings of the quality
of end-of-life care and 2 measures of patient goal attainment.
To assess care quality, family members were asked: “Overall,
how would you rate the care received [at the last place where
care was provided]? Would you say it was excellent, very good,
good, fair, or poor?” We defined high-quality end-of-life care
as that which family members rated as excellent.13
We assessed patient goal attainment using 2 measures.
First, family members were asked “In your opinion, to what
extent were [the patient’
s] wishes followed in the medical care
received in the last month of life?” Goal attainment was de-
fined as care that “followed patients’wishes a great deal.” In
addition, family were asked where the patient’
s preferred and
actual places of death were; by design, these questions were
separated by more than 40 questions to minimize conscious
comparison, but included similar categories.
Categories of preferred location of death included hospi-
tal, home, relative’
s home, nursing facility, and other. Catego-
ries of actual place of death included hospital, home, nursing
home, hospice inpatient unit, and other (specify). Patients
whoseactualplaceofdeathmatchedtheirpreferredplacewere
considered to have achieved goal attainment. Preferences for
home were considered to match if the patient died at home or
at a relative’
s home. For the small number of patients who died
in a hospice inpatient unit or “other” that could not be as-
signed to a preexisting preference category, the variable was
coded as unknown.
Independent Variables
We previously developed 5 measures of aggressive end-of-life
care that address (1) overuse of chemotherapy near death,
(2) possible misuse of treatments resulting in emergency de-
partment visits, hospitalizations, or ICU stays, and (3) under-
use of hospice. These measures were developed through

Medicare claims data.14,15 We examined deaths that occurred
inhospitalsusingfamilymember–reportedlocationofdeathbe-
cause hospital deaths have been associated with worse family
member–reported patient quality of life near death compared
with home deaths, and increased psychiatric morbidity among
caregivers.16
Control Variables
We obtained information about patients’sociodemographic
characteristics (age, marital status, education, and income),
overall health status, comorbid conditions, depression, and
treatment preferences from family members who completed
the after-death interview. Race/ethnicity was analyzed as a po-
tential determinant of the quality of end-of-life care because
patients may vary in their treatment preferences, advance care
planning, and health care use.17 Cancer stage at diagnosis and
type was obtained through medical record abstraction or, if
unavailable, from cancer registries.
We also adjusted for geographic region and enrollment in
an integrated health system, which included 5 sites and Kaiser
PermanenteofNorthernorSouthernCalifornia.Inaddition,we
adjusted for time from diagnosis to death as a linear variable,
family respondent (eg, spouse or partner, child, other relative,
orfriend),andtimefromdeathtointerviewcompletionasalin-
ear variable. In additional analyses, we tested for interactions
between time from death to interview completion and respon-
dentrole;noneoftheinteractionswerestatisticallysignificant,
so the models included only the main effects.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptivestatisticswereusedtocharacterizefamilymember–
rated quality of end-of-life care, patient goal attainment, and
rates of aggressive end-of-life care according to patient pref-
erences. We examined associations between aggressive end-
of-life care and family member–reported (1) excellent quality
end-of-life care, (2) care consistent with patient wishes, and
(3) death in preferred place using regression models, ad-
justed for all other covariates, regardless of statistical signifi-
cance. For each dependent variable, separate models were fit
for each indicator of aggressive end-of-life care, adjusting for
the patient characteristics described. We fit linear-binomial
models with an identity link to estimate adjusted differences
in the likelihood of each outcome.18
In each model, we only included patients without miss-
ing data for that outcome measure. Because covariate infor-
mation was missing for between 0.8% (education level) to 10%
(patient treatment preferences) of the cohort, we used mul-
tiple imputation methods to create 5 complete data sets and
repeated all analyses on each imputed data set, combining
results using standard methods for multiply-imputed data.19
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine associa-
tions between patient preference for life-extending treat-
ments and receipt of aggressive care over shorter periods (ie,
≤90 days and ≤180 days from diagnosis to death). We exam-
ined the effect of recategorizing family member–reported
quality ratings for end-of-life care as “excellent and very
good” vs “good, fair, and poor” and as an ordinal model. We
also fit models that included family members’contact with
patients during the last week as a proxy for closeness. We
repeated these analyses among a subset of the total cohort
with information from the baseline interview and the 1-year
follow-up interview, both with and without family member–
reported frequency of discussing important medical deci-
sions with the patient. Next, we examined the effect of
including patients’symptoms at the end-of-life (eg, pain and
difficulty breathing) and how well these were controlled
because uncontrolled symptoms often precipitate hospital-
izations near death. In addition, we repeated all analyses
stratified by disease site.
Two-sided P values <.05 were considered statistically sig-
nificant. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS
software version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Among 3620 patients who were diagnosed with or experi-
enced advanced-stage cancer recurrence, 2011 were linked to
medical claims; of these, 1847 had died by the end of 2011 and
1713 were aged 65 years or older as of 3 months before death
(linkage rate with claims was >90% across all sites for pa-
tients aged ≥65 years). We excluded 449 patients for whom we
did not have an after-death interview from a family member
(the after-death interviews were available for 73.8% of poten-
tially eligible patients). We also excluded 92 patients who were
not continuously enrolled in Medicare parts A and B fee-for-
service as of 3 months before death and 26 patients for whom
the family member did not rate the quality of end-of-life care,
leaving a final study population of 1146 patients (median age,
76.0 years [interquartile range, 65.0-87.0 years]).
Most of the study population had stage IV disease at di-
agnosis(Table1).Lungcancerdecedentshadmuchshorterme-
diansurvivaltimesthancolorectalcancerdecedents(122.5days
vs 572.0 days, respectively), and were more likely to die dur-
ing 2003 through 2005 compared with later (85.0% vs 50.0%,
respectively; P < .001) (eTable 1 in the Supplement). More than
80% of family members were spouses or children; 15.2% were
other relatives or friends (Table 2). Family members reported
a median of 7.0 days (interquartile range, 6.0-7.0 days) of con-
tact with patients during the last week of life. The median time
between patient death and the after-death interview was 144.5
days (interquartile range, 85.0-551.0 days). Patients with an af-
ter-death interview did not differ significantly from patients
without one by cancer type or sex; however, they were more
likely to be older, white, and have died within 3 months of
cancer diagnosis (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Overall, family members reported that the quality of end-
of-life care was excellent for 51.3% of decedents, very good for
27.8%, and good, fair, or poor for 20.9% (Table 3). Among fam-
ily members, 81.1% indicated that patients’end-of-life wishes
were followed a “great deal,
” whereas 18.9% reported that end-
of-life care was “somewhat” or “not at all” consistent with pa-
tients’wishes; only 56.7% of patients died in their preferred
location.

Patient Preferences and Aggressive End-of-Life Care
Patients’treatment preferences were significantly associated
with the medical care received near death (Table 4). For ex-
ample, patients who preferred life-extending therapies were
more likely to receive chemotherapy within 2 weeks of death
than those who preferred comfort care (12.4% vs 3.9%, respec-
tively;P < .001),andweremorelikelytoreceive3orfewerdays
of hospice care (64.2% vs 41.0%, respectively; P < .001). Re-
sults were similar among patients with shorter survival times
(eTables 3 and 4 in the Supplement).

Aggressive Treatment and Family Member–Rated Quality
of End-of-Life Care
In adjusted analyses, family members reported excellent end-
of-life care more often for patients who received hospice care
for longer than 3 days (58.8% [352/599]) than those who did
notreceivehospicecareorreceived3orfewerdays(43.1%[236/
547]) (adjusted difference, 16.5 percentage points [95% CI, 10.7
to 22.4 percentage points]; Table 5). In contrast, family mem-
bers of patients admitted to an ICU within 30 days of death re-
ported excellent end-of-life care less often (45.0% [68/151])
than those who were not admitted to an ICU within 30 days
of death (52.3% [520/995]) (adjusted difference, −9.4 percent-
age points [95% CI, −18.2 to −0.6 percentage points]). Simi-
larly, family members of patients who died in the hospital re-
ported excellent end-of-life care less often (42.2% [194/460])
than those who did not die in the hospital (57.4% [394/686])
(adjusted difference, −17.0 percentage points [95% CI, −22.9
to −11.1 percentage points]). Family member–reported end-of-
life care quality ratings were not significantly different in pa-
tients with frequent use (≥2 visits) of the emergency depart-
ment during the last month of life (51.1% [46/90]) and in those
without such use (51.3% [542/1056]) (adjusted difference, −1.5
percentage points [95% CI, −12.8 to 9.7 percentage points]) and

therapy (51.5% [551/1071]) (adjusted difference, −2.6 percent-
age points [95% CI, −14.8 to 9.6 percentage points]).
Aggressive End-of-Life Care and Patient Goal Attainment
Family members of patients who did not receive hospice care
or received 3 or fewer days were less likely to report that pa-
tientsdiedintheirpreferredplace(40.0%[152/380])thanthose
who received hospice care for longer than 3 days (72.8% [287/
394]) (adjusted difference, −34.4 percentage points [95% CI,
−41.7 to −27.0 percentage points]; Table 6). Patients who were
admitted to an ICU during the last month of life were less likely
to die in their preferred place (38.0% [35/92]) than those who
were not admitted to the ICU (59.2% [404/682]) (adjusted dif-
ference, −22.8 percentage points [95% CI, −33.5 to −12.0 per-
centage points]). Patients who received chemotherapy within
2 weeks of death were less likely to die in their preferred place
(42.1% [16/38]) than those who did not receive chemotherapy
neartheendoflife(57.5%[423/736])(adjusteddifference,−17.7
percentage points [95% CI, −34.0 to −1.4 percentage points]).
In sensitivity analyses that recategorized family member–
reported quality of end-of-life care as “excellent” and “very
good” vs “good,” “fair,” and “poor,” and as an ordinal model,
the results were consistent with the main findings. There were
few differences in the models that included family member–
reported contact with patients during the last week or fre-
quency of discussions of important medical decisions with pa-
tients. We also found few differences in results from analyses
that included family member–reported measures of patients’
symptoms, and whether they were adequately controlled
(eTables 5 and 6 in the Supplement).
Inaddition,theresultswerecomparableinthemodelsstrati-
fied by cancer type except that ICU admissions were not asso-
ciatedwithfamilymember–reportedqualityofend-of-lifecare.
Familymembersofpatientswithcolorectalcancerwhodidnot
receive hospice care or received 3 or fewer days before death
were less likely to report that patients’wishes were followed “a
great deal” (66.6%) than those who received hospice care for
longer than 3 days (84.4%) (adjusted difference, −17.8 percent-
age points [95% CI, −28.9 to −6.7 percentage points]; P = .002).
Discussion
In this diverse population-based cohort, we found that 3 mea-
sures of aggressive end-of-life care (ICU admission within 30
days of death, no hospice care or ≤3 days of hospice services,
anddeathsoccurringinthehospital)wereassociatedwithrela-
tively large differences in family member–reported quality rat-
ings for end-of-life care and a lower likelihood that patients

withadvanced-stagecancerreceivedcarecongruentwiththeir
preferences. Our findings suggest that efforts to increase ear-
lier hospice enrollment and avoidance of ICU admissions and
hospital deaths might improve the quality of end-of-life care.
For example, implementation of multifaceted approaches (eg,
enhanced counseling of patients and families, early palliative
care referrals, and an audit and feedback system to monitor
physicians’use of aggressive end-of-life care) might result in
more preference-sensitive care for patients and overall im-
proved quality of end-of-life care.2,16
To our knowledge, this study is one of the first empirical
validationsoftheseaggressiveend-of-lifecareindicatorsusing
patient- and family member–centered outcomes in a popula-
tion-based cohort. These findings may have policy implica-
tions because administrative database indicators4 are becom-
ing increasingly feasible to assess with the expansion of
electronic health records under the Health Information Tech-
nology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. This is particu-
larly noteworthy given increasing evidence that physicians’
characteristics and beliefs are one of the strongest predictors
of end-of-life care,20,21 suggesting that modifications to phy-
sicians’practices may result in significant improvements.
Severalstudieshavepreviouslydocumentedanassociation
between less-aggressive end-of-life care and improved patient
quality of life near death.2,8,16,22-25 Our study extends this re-
search by demonstrating similar associations with family
member–rated quality for end-of-life care in a large cohort of
patients treated in community settings in multiple regions of
theUnitedStates.Inaddition,weassessedpatients’preferences
forcareandfoundthatmostolderpatientswithfee-for-service
Medicarewantedpalliativetreatmentsmorethanlife-extending
care, and preferred to die at home, which is similar to the find-
ingsfromotherstudies.26,27Suchpreferenceswerestronglyas-
sociated with the aggressiveness of end-of-life care received.
Although existing quality measures characterize the re-
peated use of emergency visits near death as poor quality care,
wedidnotobserveadifferenceinfamilymember–reportedrat-
ings by this measure, perhaps because some patients or care-
givers may be unprepared or unable to manage acute symp-
tomsathome.28Thelackofvalidationofthisindicatorsuggests
that some aggressive care measures may be less salient to pa-
tients and families.
Similarly, we found no differences in family member–
rated quality of end-of-life care among patients who received
chemotherapy within 2 weeks of death compared with those
who did not, although the study was underpowered to detect
thesedifferencesbecauselessthan7%ofpatientsreceivedche-
motherapywithinthisperiodclosetodeath.Nevertheless,che-
motherapy use within 2 weeks of death was associated with a
decreasedlikelihoodthatpatients’diedintheirpreferredplace,
which is consistent with another study.29
Ourstudyhadsomelimitations.Althoughthepatientswho
enrolled in CanCORS were representative of patients diag-
nosed with lung and colorectal cancer in the US regions cov-
ered by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
registries,30 we studied older patients with lung and colorec-
tal cancers insured by Medicare who died predominantly be-
fore 2008. We had to exclude many patients who were not en-
rolled in Medicare fee-for-service plans or whose family
members could not be reached. Our findings may not be gen-
eralizable to patients who are younger, commercially in-
sured, uninsured, treated in Veteran’
s Administration hospi-
tals, have other diseases, or died more recently. The data are
older, particularly for patients who died soon after diagnosis,
duetothetimeinvolvedwithlinkinginterviewandclaimsdata.
However, one of the study’
s strengths is that it includes pa-
tientswhowerelonger-termcancersurvivorswhomayhavedif-
ferent experiences near death. In addition, recent data demon-
strate that end-of-life care among Medicare beneficiaries
remains intensive (ICU admissions and late hospice enroll-
mentsareincreasingovertime)1;thuspatients’andfamilymem-
bers’experiences are likely to be similar today. Our results may
be subject to unmeasured confounding related to unsuccess-
ful linkages to Medicare claims. However, our family member–
reported rates of “excellent” quality for end-of-life care and re-
ceipt of care that was not consistent with patients’preferences
are similar to another population-based study of patients who
died from diverse diseases and were insured by Medicare fee-
for-service and health maintenance organization plans.31
Family members reported on patients’end-of-life expe-
riences at variable time points after death, and some may have
forgotten details over time. Although a recent study demon-
strates moderate to high stability in bereaved family mem-
bers’assessments of patients’end-of-life experiences over
time,32 future research should examine family members’re-
call over longer durations. We relied on family members’re-
ports of patients’preferred and actual place of death to deter-
mine goal attainment. Nevertheless, these questions were
separated by at least 40 questions to minimize conscious com-
parisons. In addition, the study was underpowered to exam-
ine some associations (eg, we had 80% power to detect a 17%
absolute difference in the quality of end-of-life care between
patients who were and were not hospitalized ≥2 times during
the last month of life, but this outcome was relatively
infrequent).
Conclusions
Among family members of older patients with fee-for service
Medicare who died of lung or colorectal cancer, earlier hos-
pice enrollment, avoidance of ICU admissions within 30 days
of death, and death occurring outside the hospital were asso-
ciated with perceptions of better end-of-life care. These find-
ings are supportive of advance care planning consistent with
the preferences of patients.
