interventions on academic and physical
activity outcomes: a systematic review and
meta-analysis

Abstract
Background: Physical activity is associated with many physical and mental health benefits, however many children
do not meet the national physical activity guidelines. While schools provide an ideal setting to promote children’s
physical activity, adding physical activity to the school day can be difficult given time constraints often imposed
by competing key learning areas. Classroom-based physical activity may provide an opportunity to increase
school-based physical activity while concurrently improving academic-related outcomes. The primary aim of this
systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the impact of classroom-based physical activity interventions
on academic-related outcomes. A secondary aim was to evaluate the impact of these lessons on physical activity
levels over the study duration.
Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, ERIC, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO) was performed in
January 2016 and updated in January 2017. Studies that investigated the association between classroom-based
physical activity interventions and academic-related outcomes in primary (elementary) school-aged children were
included. Meta-analyses were conducted in Review Manager, with effect sizes calculated separately for each
outcome assessed.
Results: Thirty-nine articles met the inclusion criteria for the review, and 16 provided sufficient data and appropriate
design for inclusion in the meta-analyses. Studies investigated a range of academic-related outcomes including
classroom behaviour (e.g. on-task behaviour), cognitive functions (e.g. executive function), and academic achievement
(e.g. standardised test scores). Results of the meta-analyses showed classroom-based physical activity had a positive
effect on improving on-task and reducing off-task classroom behaviour (standardised mean difference = 0.60 (95% CI:
0.20,1.00)), and led to improvements in academic achievement when a progress monitoring tool was used (standardised
mean difference = 1.03 (95% CI: 0.22,1.84)). However, no effect was found for cognitive functions (standardised mean
difference = 0.33 (95% CI: -0.11,0.77)) or physical activity (standardised mean difference = 0.40 (95% CI: -1.15,0.95)).
Conclusions: Results suggest classroom-based physical activity may have a positive impact on academic-related
outcomes. However, it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions due to the level of heterogeneity in
intervention components and academic-related outcomes assessed. Future studies should consider the
intervention period when selecting academic-related outcome measures, and use an objective measure of
physical activity to determine intervention fidelity and effects on overall physical activity levels.

 Background
Multiple physical and mental health benefits can be
attained when children participate in the recommended
60 min per day of moderate- to vigorous-intensity phys-
ical activity [1, 2]. Despite these benefits, population
based-studies have reported that over 50% of children in
Australia and internationally are not meeting recom-
mendations [3–6]. Schools are considered ideal settings
for the promotion of children’s physical activity. There
are multiple opportunities for children to be physically
active over the course of the school week, including
during break times, sport, Physical Education class
and active travel to and from school. Studies have
shown interventions targeting these discrete periods
may be effective in increasing children’s physical ac-
tivity levels [7, 8], with the potential to contribute to
up to 50% of the physical activity required to meet
physical activity guidelines [9]. However, with limited
time available during these discrete periods, additional
opportunities may be required in order for children
to achieve the recommended levels of physical activ-
ity. Classroom-based physical activity provides another
way for children to be active at school. This involves
classroom teachers incorporating physical activity into
class time through either integrating physical activity
into
lessons
(physically
active
lessons),
or
adding
short bursts of physical activity, either with curricu-
lum content (curriculum focused active breaks) or
without (active breaks).
There is increasing interest from researchers and
education
professionals
about
the
potential
for
classroom-based physical activity to positively impact
academic-related outcomes, including classroom beha-
viour, cognitive function and academic achievement.
While some teachers express concern that classroom-
based physical activity may have an adverse effect on
on-task classroom behaviour [10], emerging evidence
from systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggest that
overall physical activity may have a small positive effect
on on-task classroom behaviour [11–17]. There is less
evidence on classroom-based physical activity.
Narrative reviews [18–20], one systematic review [21]
and two meta-analyses [22, 23] have explored the impact
of classroom-based physical activity interventions on
academic-related outcomes. However, these were narrow
in scope, included few studies, and combined findings
among primary and secondary school students, which
may be problematic due to the difference in education
settings.
A systematic review of 11 studies concluded that
physically active lessons may have a positive effect, or
no effect on academic-related outcomes [21]. However,
that study did not consider other forms of classroom-
based physical activity (e.g. active breaks), combined
findings among primary and secondary school students,
and did not include a meta-analysis [21].
A meta-analysis of four intervention studies found that
classroom-based physical activity had a positive effect on
academic-related outcomes (M = 0.67; 95%CI:0.26,1.09)
[23]. Similar results were reported in a meta-analysis of
24 intervention studies investigating the association
between different types of physical activity (e.g., du-
ring recess or lunch vs. active breaks vs. physically ac-
tive lessons) and school engagement (behaviour at
home and at school, and emotions, e.g. lesson enjoy-
ment)
[22].
In
that
meta-analysis,
overall
results
showed physical activity had a significant positive ef-
fect on school engagement (d = 0.28;95%CI:0.12,0.46)
[22]. When broken down into type of physical acti-
vity, active breaks (n = 4 studies) appeared to be the
most
effective
type
of
intervention
for
improving
school engagement (d = 0.55; 95%CI:0.02,1.06), com-
pared with recess or lunch time physical activity
(n = 3 studies; d = 0.26; 95%CI:-0.19,0.73) and physic-
ally active lessons (n = 5 studies; d = 0.22; 95%CI:
-0.21,0.66) [22]. However, results from those meta-
analyses are limited by the small number of included
studies
[22,
23],
the
narrow
range
of
potential
academic-related outcomes assessed, the combination
of findings among primary and secondary school stu-
dents [22], and their recency [23].
The current paper aims to expand on findings from
these reviews by conducting a systematic review and
meta-analyses of the evidence of effect of classroom-
based physical activity interventions (active breaks,
curriculum-focused active breaks and physically active
lessons) on a broad range of academic-related out-
comes (classroom behavior, cognitive function and
academic
achievement),
specifically
among
primary
school-aged children. A secondary aim is to examine
the effect of these interventions on children’s physical
activity levels.
Methods
Definitions
While there are no set definitions for classroom-based
physical activity, the following definitions are provided
in order to maintain consistency and clarity throughout
the remainder of this systematic review.
Classroom-based physical activity: physical activity
carried out during regular class time, and can occur ei-
ther inside or outside the classroom (e.g. hallway, play-
ground), and is distinct from school recess/lunch break
times. Classroom-based physical activity can take three
forms:
� Active breaks: short bouts of physical activity
performed as a break from academic instruction [24].
Watson et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  (2017) 14:114 
Page 2 of 24
 � Curriculum-focussed active breaks: short bouts of
physical activity that include curriculum content
[25, 26].
� Physically active lessons: the integration of physical
activity into lessons in key learning areas other than
physical education (e.g. mathematics) [27, 28].
Academic-related outcomes: overarching term to en-
compass factors associated with academic performance
at school. These can be grouped into three main
categories:
� Classroom behaviour: Observed behaviours that may
promote or interfere with learning in the classroom,
including on-task behaviour [29] (e.g. concentrating
on tasks assigned by the teacher), and off-task be-
haviour (e.g. not concentrating on tasks assigned by
the teacher).
� Cognitive function: Mental process (e.g. executive
function) that may influence academic
performance [29].
� Academic achievement: A child’s performance on
school-related tasks; often reported via classroom
grades, national standardised tests or progress moni-
toring tools [29], as well as self-reported perceived
academic competence [30].
Registration and protocol
This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic
Reviews
and
Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA)
recommendations for systematic review reporting, and
was
registered
with
the
International
Prospective
Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (record
#CRD42016027294).
Search strategy
Studies were identified through a systematic search of
four electronic databases (PubMed, ERIC, SPORTDiscus
and PsycINFO), first conducted in January 2016, and up-
dated in January 2017 by one author (AW). The search
strategy consisted of four elements (see Table 1). The
search was limited to peer-reviewed articles published in
English in all available years. ‘Grey’ literature, including
the reference lists from the websites of two organisations
(“Active Academics” and “Active Living Research”) in-
volved in children’s physical activity research were also
searched.
Inclusion criteria
A predetermined set of inclusion criteria were used to
select papers for this systematic review. Each study had
to meet the following criteria:
1. Intervention study design;
2. Investigated associations between classroom-based
physical activity and at least one academic-related
outcome. Interventions involving strategies in
addition to classroom-based physical activity were
excluded (to enable the effects of classroom-based
physical activity to be isolated);
3. Study population included primary school-aged chil-
dren (5–12 years);
4. Presented original data;
5. Did not focus specifically on special populations (e.g.
overweight children).
Study selection
The search yielded 7729 citations from electronic data-
base records, and 17 from ‘grey’ literature (Fig. 1). After
removing duplicates (n = 500), the titles and/or abstracts
of 7246 unique publications were screened by one au-
thor (AW). A total of 101 publications were identified as
potentially relevant according to the inclusion criteria.
Full texts of 98 of these 101 articles were obtained and
reviewed independently by two authors to determine eli-
gibility (AW, KB). Two full texts were conference ab-
stracts only, and one full-text was unable to be retrieved
despite extensive librarian-assisted enquiries and emails
directly to the contact author. Of the 98 full-text articles,
a total of 59 were excluded as not meeting inclusion cri-
teria. Disagreements between the two reviewers were
resolved through discussion with all authors. Reference
lists of included articles were also examined, however no
additional studies were identified. Thirty-nine unique
citations
satisfied
the
eligibility
criteria
and
were
included in this systematic review.
Data extraction
Paper characteristics including country of study, study
design, participant characteristics, intervention charac-
teristics, academic-related outcome measures, physical
activity measures, and results were extracted by one au-
thor (AW). Interventions were then categorised as active
break, curriculum focussed active break, or physically
active lesson intervention.
Methodological quality
Two authors (AW, KB) independently assessed the
methodological quality of the included studies using the
Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) tool
[31]. This six-component rating scale for interventions
assesses (1) selection bias; (2) study design; (3) con-
founders; (4) blinding; (5) data collection methods; and
(6) withdrawals and drop outs. Each component was
rated on a three-point scale as either strong, moderate
or weak using the tool’s defined criteria. Based on these
ratings, an overall methodological quality score was
given;
either
strong
(no
weak
component
ratings);

than one weak component rating), following the tool’s
accompanying
instructions.
Where
disagreements
existed, deliberation occurred until a consensus was
reached.
Meta-analyses
Meta-analyses were conducted where there were at least
three studies investigating the same broad outcome, i.e.
classroom behaviour, cognitive function, or academic
achievement. Due to heterogeneity across study designs,
for inclusion studies were required to have a separate
comparison group (i.e. RCT or quasi experimental with
control group). Studies that used a within subject or
cross over study design were therefore excluded from
meta-analysis.
To avoid duplication of studies under a single out-
come, where studies reported intervention effects on
multiple measures for an outcome (this happened
only for cognitive functions) [32, 33] a decision was
made to include outcomes relating to executive func-
tions, over memory. Executive functions, inhibition in
particular, have been shown to be consistently related
to academic achievement [34] and therefore were
considered salient to teachers. Thus, where inhibition
and memory were reported, only inhibition was in-
cluded in the meta-analysis; where executive functions
and short term memory were reported, only executive
functions
were
included
in
the
meta-analysis.
Typically
higher
scores
were
reflective
of
better
academic-related
outcomes.
Where
lower
scores
reflected
better
academic-related
outcomes
these
scores were reversed.
As academic achievement tools varied widely in qual-
ity, only studies using national standardised tests or
progress monitoring tools were included in the meta-
analyses. Further, intervention effects on mathematics
were used when studies reported multiple subject assess-
ments, as math was the most commonly reported
outcome. Of the 39 studies included in this systematic
review, 16 were included in meta-analyses. Reasons for
exclusion were: insufficient data for calculating effect
sizes and authors did not respond to email requests for
additional data (n = 6), using a within subject or cross-
over study design (n = 9), not including a separate com-
parison group (n = 2), insufficient studies investigating

 an outcome (n = 4), or only reporting results separately
for subgroups (e.g. BMI categories) (n = 2).
Analysis
Meta-analyses were conducted using Review Manager 5.3.
The wide variation in interventions and academic-related
outcomes employed in the different studies warranted use
of a random effects model. Effect sizes (standardised mean
difference) were computed as the difference between
treatment and control means.
Results
Of the 39 studies identified, 19 examined the effect of
active
breaks
[24,
26,
35–51],
seven
examined
curriculum-focussed active breaks [25, 52–57], and thir-
teen examined physically active lessons [27, 28, 32, 33,
58–66] on academic-related outcomes. The majority of
studies (n = 27) were published in or after 2014 [24, 26,
32, 33, 36, 39–41, 43, 46–51, 57, 65, 66], and none be-
fore 2006. Most (n = 18) were conducted in the USA
[25, 36, 39, 40, 42, 44, 45, 51–55, 57–60, 64, 65], seven
in the Netherlands [32, 41, 49, 50, 61, 62, 66], four in
Australia [27, 28, 46, 47], three in Canada [24, 35, 43],
two in Scotland [37, 38], and one each in South Africa
[48],
UK
[63],
Greece
[56]
Denmark
[33],
and
Switzerland [26]. Sample sizes ranged from 14 [60] to
over 4500 participants [45], with sample sizes <300 in
the majority of studies (n = 28) [24–28, 33, 35, 39–41,
43, 44, 46–51, 53, 55–57, 59–64]. Intervention periods
spanned from single lessons [49, 55, 59, 65] to 3 year
duration [58], with most lasting no longer than nine
weeks (n = 23) [24–28, 33, 37–41, 43–46, 48, 50, 52,
55–57, 59, 63]. Study information is presented in Table 2
(active breaks), Table 3 (curriculum focused active
breaks) and Table 4 (physically active lessons).
Intervention content
There was considerable variation across studies in
intervention content. While most (12 out of 19) ac-
tive break interventions featured basic aerobic move-
ments that students could be performed in their
classroom (e.g. jumping jacks), and required no set-up
or equipment [24, 35–40, 42, 43, 45, 50, 51], others
were performed outside the classroom (e.g. sports
field)
[26,
41,
46–48],
and/or
required
additional
equipment (e.g. markers, skipping ropes, balls, exer-
cise bands, dance videos, or specialised stacking cups)
[41, 44, 46, 49]. One study utilised both cognitively
engaging active breaks (i.e. physical activity combined
with cognitive demand) and active breaks to explore
separate and combined effects of physical activity and
cognitive engagement on cognitive function [26]. The
target frequency, duration and physical activity inten-
sity of the breaks varied, ranging from 4 min of
vigorous-intensity physical activity weekly [24, 43] to
20 min of moderate intensity physical activity done
twice per day [49].
There
was
more
consistency
in
content
across
curriculum-focussed active breaks, compared with the
active
breaks
without
curriculum
content.
All
curriculum-focussed active breaks featured physical ac-
tivity integrated into a combination of key learning
areas, including mathematics, language, science and/or
social studies, and aimed to reinforce previously taught
lesson content [25, 52–57]. Further, most (5 out of 7)
required daily participation in 10 to 20 min of physical
activity [19, 52–54, 57]. When specified, participation
was
required
at
a
moderate-[56]
or
moderate-to
vigorous-physical activity intensity [55], but intensity
was not specified in the majority (5 out of 7) of these
studies [25, 52–54, 57].
While curriculum-focussed active breaks aimed to
reinforce previously taught lesson content, physically
active lessons were used to teach new lesson content
[27, 28, 32, 33, 58–62, 64–66]. These lessons predom-
inately incorporated physical activity into mathematics
and/or language lessons, but some also incorporated
science and/or social studies [27, 28, 32, 33, 58–62,
64–66].
Lessons
ranged
in
duration
from
30
to
60 min [27, 28, 32, 33, 60–64, 66] with most (8 out
of 13) requiring participation three times per week
[27, 28, 32, 33, 61, 62, 64, 66]. Other physically active
lessons were described as single lessons as part of
pilot interventions [59, 63, 65], or stipulated physical
activity time per week, rather than number of lessons
per week [58].
Intervention fidelity
Intervention fidelity was reported in twelve studies.
For the three active break interventions delivered by
teachers, various measures of fidelity were used, how-
ever,
no
study
clearly
reported
compliance
with
implementing active breaks daily or the number of
active break sessions conducted. Active break inter-
ventions delivered by research staff reported high fi-
delity, showing most children achieved the required
physical activity intensity [39–41], or at least 50% of
each intervention session was spent at the required
intensity [46, 47].
For physically active lesson interventions, teacher re-
ports showed they delivered lessons either as intended
[27] or for at least 50% of the required minutes per week
[58]. Similar to active break studies, when delivered by
research staff, at least 60% of intervention lessons were
spent at the required physical activity intensity [61, 62].
No curriculum focussed active break study reported
fidelity.

 Methodological quality
Of the 39 identified studies, most (36 out of 39) received
a moderate [24, 26, 33, 38–41, 48, 53, 55–57, 60, 62], or
weak quality rating score [25, 27, 28, 35–37, 42, 44–47,
49–52, 54, 59, 61, 63–66]. Three received a strong qual-
ity rating score [32, 43, 58]. Low to moderate quality
score ratings were mostly attributable to not reporting
or controlling for relevant demographic confounders,
not reporting blinding of participants and researchers,
and not reporting participant attrition. Further, for many
studies, authors did not report the rate of participant or
school participation. See Appendix A for further detail
on quality assessment of included studies.
Academic-related outcomes: Classroom behaviour
Studies assessed the effect of participation in these pro-
grams on academic-related outcomes both immediately
following participation in a session (acute) and after a
longer exposure (chronic; e.g. pre- and post- interven-
tion periods spanning up to 8 months). Regardless of
type of classroom-based physical activity, the majority of
studies (10 out of 12) showed participation in these pro-
grams had an acute effect on improving on-task class-
room behaviour [25, 27, 28, 39, 52, 57, 62, 65] and
reducing off-task behaviour [36, 43] However, evidence
in the few studies with longer term follow-up (2 out of 2
studies) suggest that this improvement may dissipate
over time, with no difference between groups when
chronic intervention effects on reported behaviour inci-
dents were assessed [42, 47]. Due to few studies investi-
gating
chronic
effects
of
classroom-based
physical
activity on on-task and off task classroom behaviour
(<5) it was not possible to separate acute and chronic ef-
fects in the meta-analysis. Results from the 4 included
studies show classroom-based physical activity had a
positive effect on improving on-task behaviour and redu-
cing
off-task
behaviour
(standardised
mean
differ-
ence = 0.60 (95% CI: 0.20,1.00)) (see Fig. 2).
Academic-related outcomes: Cognitive function
Studies also assessed acute and chronic effects of
classroom-based physical activity on a range of cognitive
functions [24, 32, 37, 38, 40, 41, 46, 47, 49, 50, 54, 64].
Results showed active breaks had an acute positive effect
on selective attention (3 out of 4 studies) [24, 41, 49].
No acute effect was reported for sustained attention
[46], information processing [50] or focussed attention,
processing speed and accuracy [26], and no chronic ef-
fect was reported for planning, attention, simultaneous
or successive cognitive processes [47] or executive func-
tion [32]. Acute intervention effects on executive func-
tion were inconsistent, with no difference between
groups reported in one study [40], while another re-
ported improvements in executive function but only for
those receiving the intervention in the second week of
delivery [37, 38]. Results were also inconsistent for
chronic intervention effects on fluid intelligence, with
one study reporting a significant improvement after
3 months [64], while another reported no difference be-
tween groups after 1-year [54]. Due to few studies
reporting chronic effects of participation (<5) results for
acute and chronic studies were combined in the meta-
analysis (5 studies). Results from the meta-analysis indi-
cate classroom-based physical activity had no effect on
cognitive function (standardised mean difference = 0.33
(95% CI: -0.11,0.77) (see Fig. 3).
Academic-related outcomes: Academic achievement
Studies
assessed
intervention
effects
on
academic
achievement using a range of academic assessment
tools, including standardised tests, progress monitor-
ing tools, grades and content recall quizzes. Reported
effects on academic achievement varied by interven-
tion duration and the type of assessment tool used.
Interventions of shorter duration tended to show im-
provement in academic achievement if a progress
monitoring tool was used, but not if a national stan-
dardised test was used. Seven out of 8 studies using a
progress monitoring tool reported significant improve-
ment in academic achievement following intervention
periods ranging from 4 weeks to 1-year [40, 44, 53,
54, 60, 61, 66]. In contrast, most (4 out of 7) studies
indicated
no
difference
between
groups
following
intervention periods less than 1-year when national
standardised tests were used as the outcome measure
[27, 42, 64, 66]. However, standardised test scores

Watson et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  (2017) 14:114 
Page 16 of 24
 significantly improved following a 1-year [51] and 3-
year physically active lesson intervention [58]. These
results were confirmed in the meta-analysis. When
progress monitoring tools were used (4 studies) as
the
outcome
measure,
academic-related
outcomes
generally
showed
improvement
(standardised
mean
difference = 1.03 (95% CI: -0.22,1.84)). However, when
measured using a national standardised test (6 stud-
ies), academic-related outcomes generally showed no
improvement (standardised mean difference = −1.13
(95% CI: -0.72,0.46)) (see Fig. 4).
In addition to standardised tests and progress moni-
toring tools, a small number of studies (not included
in the meta-analysis) measured academic achievement
via grades, content recall quizzes and self-reported
academic competence. Results were inconsistent. One
study
reported
no
difference
between
groups
for
grades across eight subjects (total score) following a
20-week active break program [47], Another reported
a greater proportion of students in the control group
showed improvement in grades for math and reading,
compared with an active break intervention group
[42]. Other studies assessed academic achievement via
content recall quizzes and perceptions of academic
competence, with no difference between groups in
math and social studies scores following participation
in single lessons lasting between 10 and 30 min [59, 63].
Another
study
reported self-reported
perceptions
of
academic competence improved during physically active
lessons [56].
Dose response relationship
Four studies aimed to explore the optimal dose of
active break (i.e. amount of physical activity required
to confer academic benefits) required to provide max-
imum effects on academic-related outcomes, by ma-
nipulating
intensity
[41],
duration
[39,
40],
and
frequency [49] of active break sessions. Howie and
colleagues [39, 40] compared 5-, 10- and 20-min ac-
tive breaks with a 10-min no break condition. Results

 showed on-task classroom behaviour significantly im-
proved after the 10-min active break condition [39]
and
math
scores
were
highest
after
the
10-min
(ES = 0.24) and 20-min (ES = 0.27) active break con-
ditions [40]. Janssen et al. [41] compared selective at-
tention scores across 15 min of each of the following
four
conditions:
no
break
(continued
with
school
work), passive break (teacher read story), moderate-
intensity active break (jogging, passing, dribbling), and
vigorous-intensity
active
break
(running,
jumping,
skipping) [41]. Results showed that selective attention
scores improved most after the moderate-intensity ac-
tive break [41]. Altenburg and colleagues [49] com-
pared acute effects of different frequencies (one per
day vs. twice per day) of 20 min moderate-intensity
active breaks. Results showed significantly better se-
lective attention scores for children who received the
twice per day frequency [49].
Physical activity outcomes
Eleven studies examined the effect of classroom-based
physical activity interventions on children’s physical ac-
tivity levels using a range of measures, including ques-
tionnaire [35], direct observation [45], pedometer [25,
47, 52], and accelerometer [27, 28, 36, 47, 58, 60, 63].
Across most (10 out of 11) classroom-based physical
activity interventions, small increases in physical activity
were reported [25, 27, 28, 35, 36, 45, 52, 58, 60, 63].
Across studies there was a 2% to 16% increase in moder-
ate- to vigorous- intensity physical activity during inter-
vention lessons, [27, 28, 45, 60, 63], and 2% to 12%
increase in school day moderate- to vigorous- intensity
physical activity [27, 28, 58]. However, as shown in Fig. 5
results from 3 studies included in meta-analysis indicate
classroom-based physical activity did not affect physical
activity (standardised mean difference = 0.40 (95% CI:
-0.15,0.95).
Discussion
A systematic search of the literature found 39 studies
assessing the effect of classroom-based physical activity
on academic-related outcomes, including classroom be-
haviour, cognitive function and academic achievement.
In the majority of studies, academic-related outcomes
improved following participation in classroom-based
physical activity programs. These findings are gener-
ally consistent with earlier reviews finding that overall
physical activity level was either positively associated,
or was not associated with academic-related outcomes
[14, 15, 17]. In addition, the interventions included in
the current review generally resulted in more physical
activity.
The finding that classroom-based physical activity
improves
on-task
or
reduces
off-task
classroom
behaviour
immediately
following
participation
in
intervention sessions is consistent with previous re-
views of school-based physical activity. For example,
systematic reviews of the effect of physical activity
during the school break time on academic-related
outcomes showed positive associations between par-
ticipation in physical activity before class (e.g. during
recess/snack time) and on-task classroom behaviour
in subsequent lessons [17, 29]. Therefore, breaking up
lesson time with physical activity offers a promising
strategy to improve on-task behaviour. Further, phys-
ically active lessons may provide a strategy to engage
students in lesson content, which may lead to im-
proved on-task classroom behaviour. However, this
assumption is purely speculative and further research
is needed to confirm this. One study reported a non-
significant increase in on-task classroom behaviour
after intervention
sessions, compared with control
[55]. A possible reason for this finding may be that
the sample size in that study (n = 97) may not have
been large enough to detect a significant improve-
ment. Few studies (n = 3) reported that classroom-
based physical activity had no effect on classroom
behaviour. The majority of these studies (2 out of 3)
reported that, while behaviour incidents and off-task
behaviour increased in both the intervention and con-
trol groups, the increase was greater in the control
group, compared with the intervention group [46, 47].
These findings may encourage teachers to consider
implementing classroom-based physical activity pro-
grams by alleviating concerns about reducing on-task
behaviour due to the disruption to the classroom rou-
tine [10].
While classroom-based physical activity showed rela-
tively consistent positive associations with classroom be-
haviour, effects on cognitive function were inconsistent.
A possible explanation for this finding may relate to
the variability in the quality of measures used. Overall
results showed studies that reported improvements in
cognitive function used measures with moderate to
high levels of reliability and validity [67, 68]. In con-
trast, studies reporting no improvement in cognitive
function mainly used measures with lower levels of
reliability and validity [69–71]. It may be important
for future studies to use tests of cognitive function
with established validity and reliability.
A further possible explanation for inconsistent ef-
fects on cognitive function may relate to the level of
cognitive
engagement
inherent
in
each
type
of
classroom-based physical activity. It has been sug-
gested that cognitively engaging physical activity (i.e.
physical activity combined with cognitive demands)
may enhance cognitive function to a greater degree
than non-cognitively engaging physical activity (e.g.
Watson et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  (2017) 14:114 
Page 18 of 24
 repetitive exercise) [72]. As curriculum-focused active
breaks and physically active lessons can be considered
cognitively
engaging
physical
activity,
it
could
be
hypothesised
that
these
types
of
classroom-based
physical activity would lead to greater improvements
in cognitive function, compared with active breaks
that involve no cognitive content. While the majority
of physically active lesson and curriculum focussed
active break interventions (2 out of 3 studies) and
only half of active break interventions (5 out of 10
studies) led to improvements in cognitive function,
there were too few cognitively engaging interventions
included in the review to draw a definitive conclu-
sion. The one study that compared cognitively en-
gaging and non-cognitively engaging active breaks,
showed an impact on cognitive outcomes for the cog-
nitively engaging breaks group only, lending support
to this hypothesis [26]. Although not explicitly stated,
many studies which do not purport to involve cogni-
tively engaging physical activity involve some activities
which are likely to confer cognitive engagement e.g.
hopping sequences to music [37, 38], and coordina-
tive exercises [50]. Some of these report positive and
some null findings, yet it is difficult to ascertain the
proportion of physical activity children were exposed
to that was cognitively engaging. Future studies are
encouraged to separate the effects of cognitively en-
gaging and non-cognitively engaging physical activity
on cognitive functions.
In addition to the cognitive test used, results may
be
dependent
on
the
type
of
cognitive
function
assessed. For example, classroom-based physical activ-
ity appeared to have a particularly beneficial effect on
selective attention [24, 41, 49], compared with other
components of cognitive function, including sustained
attention [46], fluid intelligence [54, 64], information
processing speed [50], and executive function [32, 37,
38, 40]. However, a recent systematic review con-
cluded that there is insufficient evidence to conclude
what specific cognitive functions are most affected by
physical activity [73]. Exercise-induced arousal may
provide a further explanation for inconsistency in
findings. This theory suggests that the heightened
level of arousal during physical activity facilitates cog-
nitive function and that this effect may be moderated
by physical activity intensity [74]. However, while the
majority of included studies reported a target physical
activity intensity, few measured physical activity inten-
sity during interventions precluding conclusions re-
garding
the
role
of
physical
activity
intensity
on
cognitive
function.
Thus,
the
favourable
effect
of
physical activity on selective attention indicated in
this review requires further research for confirmation.
Nonetheless, should improvements in selective atten-
tion occur, such as the ability to ignore distractions
this may be of particular interest to teachers and may
provide motivation to incorporate physical activity
into their classroom routine.
In addition to classroom behaviour and cognitive
function, classroom-based physical activity may also
have
a
positive
effect
on
academic
achievement.
However, effects on academic achievement may be
dependent on intervention duration and the type of
assessment tool used to measure academic achieve-
ment. In the current review it appeared that inter-
ventions of shorter duration were more likely to
show an improvement in academic achievement if a
progress monitoring tool was used, rather than a
national
standardised
test.
This
may
be
because
curriculum-based
measures
are
sensitive
to
small
changes in academic achievement, and can be admin-
istered frequently (e.g. weekly) [75, 76], while stan-
dardised tests are usually designed to be administered
less frequently (e.g. yearly), and are not sensitive to
short-term progress. Therefore, progress monitoring
tools may be a more suitable choice to determine
intervention effects on academic achievement in the
short-term. This finding has important implications
for future research, indicating it may be important to
consider intervention duration when selecting the
measure of academic achievement. Therefore, future
intervention studies may consider using a progress
monitoring tool for intervention periods less than 1-
year, and standardised tests for intervention periods
longer than 1-year if academic achievement is the
outcome of interest.

Page 19 of 24
 Other studies investigated the impact of different
doses of classroom-based physical activity on academic-
related outcomes. However, results are based on few
(n = 4) heterogeneous studies which considered a lim-
ited range of potential physical activity doses. Thus, fur-
ther research is needed to be able to draw conclusions
regarding the minimal dose of active break required to
impact academic-related outcomes.
Several
studies
aimed
to
explore
the
effect
of
classroom-based physical activity on children’s phys-
ical activity levels [25, 27, 28, 35, 36, 45, 47, 52, 58,
60,
63].
Results
from
the
meta-analysis
showed
classroom-based physical activity did not affect phys-
ical activity levels. However, as only three of the 11
identified studies could be included in the meta-
analysis these results should be interpreted with cau-
tion, and further research is warranted. Findings from
the systematic review consistently revealed small in-
creases in physical activity in children participating in
the intervention, compared with students in the com-
parison group. These findings are in line with results
from another review reporting positive associations
between classroom-based physical activity interven-
tions and children’s physical activity levels [21]. While
promising, it is possible compensation for this activity
occurs outside of school. However, with limited infor-
mation available, it is difficult to make strong conclu-
sions on this. Further, it can be difficult to implement
physical activity interventions in schools, often due to
a lack of time associated with competing curriculum
demands [77]. However, classroom-based physical ac-
tivity is unique from other forms of school-based
physical activity (e.g. Physical Education class and
school sport) in that it does not compete for instruc-
tional time (physically active lessons and curriculum-
focussed active breaks) or requires only minimal time
commitment (active breaks). Thus, classroom-based
physical activity may be a potentially appealing option
for schools as it offers a time-efficient strategy to pro-
mote physical activity.
Limitations
The considerable variation between studies in study
designs, intervention content and outcome assessment
tools make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions,
as evidenced by the small proportion of studies that
could be included in meta-analyses. For studies that
assessed intervention effects on physical activity, the
majority compared physical activity levels during the
classroom-based physical activity session, with a trad-
itional seated lesson [27, 28, 45, 47], or assessed
intervention effects on school day physical activity
levels only [25, 27, 28, 36, 52, 60]. Therefore, it is un-
clear if the increase in physical activity during these
sessions is compensated for by a reduction in physical
activity at other times of the day. However, as inter-
vention effects on improving on-task, reducing off-
task
classroom
behaviour
and
cognitive
function
appear to be primarily acute, this may not be a prob-
lem for these outcomes. In addition, few studies used
an objective measure of physical activity intensity [27,
28, 35, 36, 47, 58, 60, 63]. Thus, future studies using
objective measures of physical activity are required to
determine intervention effects on overall moderate-
to- vigorous-intensity physical activity, and to deter-
mine intervention fidelity (i.e. if the required physical
activity intensity is met) within the sessions. Lastly,
given that the majority of included studies reported
significant
improvements
in
academic-related
out-
comes,
it
is
possible
publication
bias
may
have
impacted the lack of published null associations.
Conclusion
Classroom-based
physical
activity interventions may
provide a practical, low-cost, and effective strategy to in-
crease academic-related outcomes, particularly acute
positive effects on improving on-task and reducing off-
task
classroom
behaviour
and
selective
attention.
Classroom-based physical activity could also have the
potential to increase children’s physical activity levels,
however further research is needed to confirm this.
Findings from this systematic review should be inter-
preted with caution given the high number of included
studies of low methodological quality, suggesting there is
room for improvement in classroom-based physical ac-
tivity intervention study designs and reporting. This re-
view has identified a number of areas for further
research in order to increase understanding of the effect
of classroom-based physical activity on academic and
physical activity outcomes. These include the need for
future studies to use objective measures of physical ac-
tivity, and to consider intervention duration when select-
ing a measure of academic achievement. In addition,
future studies should explore the effect of classroom-
based physical activity interventions on specific cognitive
outcomes, as well as the impact of different types of
physical activity (aerobic versus anaerobic versus resis-
tance training and cognitively engaging vs. non-cognitively
engaging physical activity) on academic-related outcomes.
Further, it is not clear if improvements in academic-
related outcomes are a result of the physical activity or a
result of the break from academic instruction, therefore
future research is encouraged to add an attention control
group. Lastly, it is recommended future studies use a stan-
dardized measure of cognitive function with established
reliability and validity to be able to make comparisons
across studies.
