Experiments linking neonicotinoids and declining bee health have been criticized for
not simulating realistic exposure. Here we quantified the duration and magnitude
of neonicotinoid exposure in Canada’s corn-growing regions and used these data
to design realistic experiments to investigate the effect of such insecticides on
honey bees. Colonies near corn were naturally exposed to neonicotinoids for up to
4 months—the majority of the honey bee’s active season. Realistic experiments
showed that neonicotinoids increased worker mortality and were associated with
declines in social immunity and increased queenlessness over time. We also
discovered that the acute toxicity of neonicotinoids to honey bees doubles in
the presence of a commonly encountered fungicide. Our work demonstrates that
field-realistic exposure to neonicotinoids can reduce honey bee health in
corn-growing regions.
N
eonicotinoid insecticides (NNIs) are highly
toxic to insects (1) and have been impli-
cated in the decline of pollinators (2, 3)
and other wildlife (4). Many studies that
experimentally treated bees with sublethal
doses of NNIs documented negative effects on
bee health (5–8). However, these studies have
been criticized for using unrealistic doses and
duration of exposure (9). Although recent surveys
have quantified agrochemical residues in several
environments (10–12), they have done so during
one or two time periods in the season. We thus
lack knowledge of the typical duration that polli-
nators are exposed to NNIs—a fundamental param-
eter in ecotoxicology and one that is central to the
current debate regarding the safety of NNIs. Ad-
dressing this knowledge gap is essential for devel-
oping evidenced-based policy on the use of NNIs.
Honey bees (Apis mellifera) experienced high
colony mortality in Indiana, Ontario, and Québec’s
corn-growing regions early this decade (11, 13).
Corn production represents the largest use of
arable land in North America (14), and almost
all corn is grown from NNI-treated seeds (15). The
timing of honey bee deaths in Ontario, Québec,
and Indiana, along with the presence of NNI res-
idues in dead bees and hives in the spring (11, 13),
suggested that NNI-contaminated dust generated
during seeding was the main route of acute ex-
posure (13). However, in the absence of season-
long data, it is impossible to rule out that honey
bees are also chronically exposed to sublethal
levels of NNIs after planting. Here, we present
the findings of a 2-year study that quantified
the duration and magnitude of NNI exposure
in Canada’s corn-growing regions and experi-
mentally evaluated the influence of field-realistic
NNI exposure on honey bee health.
We quantified agrochemicals in 55 bee colonies
that were randomly allocated to five apiaries close
to corn (exposed sites, <500 m) or six apiaries
away from agriculture (unexposed sites, >3 km)
in 2014. We conducted our study after Canada
mandated the use of seed fluency agents (16) to
reduce NNI-contaminated dust generated during
corn planting. We detected 26 different agro-
chemicals that included miticides, fungicides,
herbicides, NNIs, and other insecticides (tables
S1 and S5). NNIs included clothianidin, thia-
methoxam, imidacloprid, and acetamiprid. We
detected agrochemicals in significantly more
samples in exposed, relative to unexposed, sites
(Welch’s t test: t7.92 = –3.48, P = 0.008). NNIs
were detected in significantly more time pe-
riods in exposed, relative to unexposed, sites
(t8.02 = 5.88, P < 0.001); and the period of conti-
guous exposure to NNIs was longer in exposed
(83.4 ± 13.47 SEM days), relative to unexposed,
sites (22.7 ± 10.7; t8.07 = 3.53, P = 0.007) (Fig. 1 and
fig. S1). Honey bee colonies near corn are thus
chronically exposed to NNIs for a substantial
proportion of the active season in temperate
North America.
Agrochemicals and NNIs were most prevalent
in pollen (fig. S2). However, pollen from seed-
treated crops was rarely found in NNI-positive
samples (1 in 21 for corn and 5 in 21 for soybean),
and, when present, it constituted a minute pro-
portion of the pollen grains (0.2% for corn and
a mean of 0.6% ± 0.22 SEM for soybeans). Most
pollen from NNI-positive samples originated from
nontarget plants common in Ontario and Québec
(table S2). Our findings are consistent with re-
cent studies that documented NNIs in pollen
from bee-attractive wildflowers in the United
Kingdom and USA (12, 17).
Although we detected many agrochemicals in
2014, the concentration of NNIs found in bee
samples combined with their high toxicity (table
S3) rendered them the most likely compounds to
influence honey bee health (fig. S3). We carried
out an experiment to investigate the effects of
clothianidin exposure—the most common NNI
found in our study—on honey bees by chronically
treating colonies with an artificial pollen sup-
plement containing clothianidin over a 12-week
period in 2015. We approximated field-realistic
exposure by treating colonies with progressively
smaller concentrations of clothianidin, mirror-
ing typical levels found in pollen collected from
naturally exposed colonies in 2014 (fig. S4).

total NNIs detected in bees and colony food stores in (A) exposed and (B) unexposed sites. Residues
between sampling periods were extrapolated on the basis of adjacent measurements. White areas
(ND) represent periods when NNIs were below the limit of detection (<0.4 to 1.1 ppb). Triangles
represent corn planting. The NNI detected in Québec (QC) (acetamiprid, LD50 = 63,180 ppb) is
considerably less toxic to bees than clothianidin and thiamethoxam, and the peak of exposure in
Québec in July does not reflect acute exposure.

 We first investigated the effect of clothianidin
exposure during larval development on adult traits
by removing sealed brood from treated and con-
trol colonies after the first 3 weeks of exposure
and tagging the emerging workers with radio
frequency–identification chips before introducing
them into a common untreated observation hive.
We observed age by treatment differences in the
number and duration of flights taken by experi-
mental workers (fig. S5), consistent with previ-
ously documented effects of NNIs on navigation
in honey bees (18). The treated workers, which
were exposed to contaminated brood food during
the first 9 days of their lives as larvae, had a 23%
reduced life span relative to controls (Fig. 2A)
[F(1,7) = 5.78, P = 0.047, n = 93]. The presence
of sublethal levels of NNIs in colony pollen for
3 to 4 months is thus expected to shorten the
life span of many cohorts of workers produced
in the spring and summer. The high forager mor-
tality brought upon by chronic sublethal NNI ex-
posure can, in theory, lead to cycles of precocious
foraging that reduce colony fitness and cause
colony failure (19).
We quantified hygienic behavior and the pres-
ence of a laying queen in treated colonies and
control colonies over the course of our 12-week
experiment. We hypothesized that phenotypic
effects of exposure—if they exist—should man-
ifest as a function of exposure time (20) (i.e.,
significant treatment by time interactions). We
detected a significant treatment by time inter-
action on hygienic behavior [F(1,23) = 14.86,
P = 0.001, N = 34]; the average hygienic be-
havior of clothianidin-treated colonies decreased
over time but that of control colonies did not
(Fig. 2B). We observed a similar pattern in the
field in 2014, where exposed colonies near
corn had significantly lower hygienic behavior
relative to unexposed colonies at the end of the
season (Fig. 2C) [F(1,48) = 6.42, P = 0.015, N =
50]. Our study is similar to a recent study that
found an association between chronic expo-
sure to imidacloprid and reduced hygienic be-
havior (21). Our findings indicate that NNIs
impair the honey bee’s social immune system.
We also observed a significant treatment by
time interaction on queenlessness [generalized
linear mixed model (GLMM), z = 2.242, P = 0.025,
N = 54] whereby the presence of a laying queen
declined over time in the clothianidin-treated
group (Fig. 2D). Strong colonies, like many of our
controls, typically become queenless in midsummer
during swarming season, but then rapidly rear
and sustain a replacement queen. However, that
pattern of queen loss in treated colonies peaked
well after Ontario’s swarming period, and most
treated colonies were not able to rear replace-
ment queens by the end of our experiment. Our
finding is consistent with a recent study (22) that
documented NNI effects on queen mortality and
reproductive physiology. The association between
chronic clothianidin exposure and queenlessness
is expected to have major consequences on col-
ony fitness, because colonies that are unable to
rear replacement queens eventually perish (23).
Finally, we studied possible interactions be-
tween NNIs and co-occurring agrochemicals on
bee health. Clothianidin was most commonly
found with herbicides (50%), of which linuron
was the most common (31%). Thiamethoxam was
commonly found with fungicides (79%), of which
boscalid was the most common (45%). We inves-
tigated how field-realistic doses of boscalid (mean
497 ppb in pollen) and linuron (mean 7.3 ppb
in pollen) influenced the 24-hour oral toxicity of
NNIs to honey bee workers. Boscalid and linuron
did not, on their own, cause mortality to honey
bees at field-realistic doses (0% 24-hour mortality
in triplicate trials). Linuron did not influence
the median lethal dose (LD50) of clothianidin
[generalized linear model (GLM), z = –0.700, P =
0.487, N = 45] or thiamethoxam (GLM, z = 0.611,
P = 0.544, N = 45) (Fig. 3). However, boscalid
significantlyreducedthe LD50of clothianidin(GLM,
z =2.317, P = 0.026, N = 45) and thiamethoxam
(GLM, z = 2.060, P = 0.046, N = 45) (Fig. 3). Both
NNIs became nearly twice as toxic to honey bees
in the presence of field-realistic levels of boscalid.
Our study demonstrates that honey bees in
corn-growing regions of Canada are exposed to

 toxicologically significant levels of NNIs for the
majority of the active bee season despite the man-
dated use of dust-reducing seed lubricants during
planting. Pollen from nontarget plants repre-
sents the primary route of exposure to NNIs in
our study. Like most bees, honey bees are diet
generalists, and it is thus expected that native
bees found in Canada’s corn-growing regions
would be similarly chronically exposed to NNIs.
We carried out experiments that approximated
field-realistic exposure and found biologically sig-
nificant effects of clothianidin exposure on honey-
bee worker morality, hygienic behavior, and the
abilities of colonies to sustain a laying queen over
time. Finally, we uncovered that the acute toxicity
of NNIs to honey bees increases in the presence of
field-realistic levels of a common fungicide. Our find-
ings indicate that chronic NNI exposure reduces the
health of honey bee colonies near corn crops.
