Summary
Background Killed whole-cell oral cholera vaccines (kOCVs) are becoming a standard cholera control and prevention 
tool. However, vaccine efficacy and direct effectiveness estimates have varied, with differences in study design, 
location, follow-up duration, and vaccine composition posing challenges for public health decision making. We did a 
systematic review and meta-analysis to generate average estimates of kOCV efficacy and direct effectiveness from the 
available literature.
Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane 
Review Library on July 9, 2016, and ISI Web of Science on July 11, 2016, for randomised controlled trials and 
observational studies that reported estimates of direct protection against medically attended confirmed cholera 
conferred by kOCVs. We included studies published on any date in English, Spanish, French, or Chinese. We extracted 
from the published reports the primary efficacy and effectiveness estimates from each study and also estimates 
according to number of vaccine doses, duration, and age group. The main study outcome was average efficacy and 
direct effectiveness of two kOCV doses, which we estimated with random-effect models. This study is registered with 
PROSPERO, number CRD42016048232.
Findings Seven trials (with 695 patients with cholera) and six observational studies (217 patients with cholera) met the 
inclusion criteria, with an average two-dose efficacy of 58% (95% CI 42–69, I²=58%) and effectiveness of 76% (62–85, 
I²=0). Average two-dose efficacy in children younger than 5 years (30% [95% CI 15–42], I²=0%) was lower than in 
those 5 years or older (64% [58–70], I²=0%; p<0·0001). Two-dose efficacy estimates of kOCV were similar during the 
first 2 years after vaccination, with estimates of 56% (95% CI 42–66, I²=45%) in the first year and 59% (49–67, I²=0) 
in the second year. The efficacy reduced to 39% (13 to 57, I²=48%) in the third year, and 26% (–46 to 63, I²=74%) in the 
fourth year.
Interpretation Two kOCV doses provide protection against cholera for at least 3 years. One kOCV dose provides at 
least short-term protection, which has important implications for outbreak management. kOCVs are effective tools 
for cholera control.

Introduction
For years, cholera vaccines were used infrequently because 
of gaps in evidence on efficacy and field effectiveness across 
different populations, high costs, vaccine supply constraints, 
and concerns about diverting resources from other cholera-
related interventions. Killed whole-cell oral cholera vaccines 
(kOCVs) are now becoming part of the standard cholera 
control and prevention toolkit, in addition to the established 
water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions, surveillance, 
and case management.1 Although kOCVs have been used 
across multiple settings and have been shown to be safe and 
immunogenic,2–4 effectiveness and efficacy studies have 
provided a wide range of effect estimates,5–9 hindering clear 
communication to policy makers and clinicians.
The current formulation of kOCVs is like those 
first developed in the 1970s and 1980s,10 and includes 
killed Vibrio cholerae whole cells from both main 
serotypes, Ogawa and Inaba, with the main antigen 
being the lipopolysaccharide of killed bacteria. The 
vaccines’ lipopolysaccharide concentration has increased 
since the original vaccines were developed, and some 
kOCVs contain the cholera toxin B-subunit, which was 
shown to provide no added protection in follow-up 
assessments more than 6 months after vaccination.10 
Available vaccines are licensed as two-dose regimens, 
although single-dose regimens have been tested and 
suggested as a possibility in outbreaks or when vaccine 
supply is low.11

In 2013, a global stockpile of kOCV was created by 
WHO to ensure vaccine availability for cholera control in 
outbreaks or humanitarian crises.12 Gavi, The Vaccine 
Alliance, later committed to fund up to 70 million doses 
(about US$1·85 per dose) from 2014 to 2018 to expand the 
support for vaccination in emergency and non-emergency 
(hotspot) settings through the stockpile.11 These stock-
piles, combined with the WHO prequalification of a low-
cost vaccine (Shanchol; Shantha Biotechnics, Hyderabad, 
India) in 2011, paved the way for expanded access and 
increased use of the vaccine. Although travellers to 
cholera-prone areas commonly use kOCVs,13 most of the 
world’s supply of kOCV is managed and deployed 
through these stockpiles. Countries wishing to use these 
vaccines must apply through either the emergency 
(International Coordinating Group) or non-emergency 
(Global Task Force on Cholera Control [GTFCC]) 
mechanisms.1 Supply of kOCV remains low relative to the 
size of the at-risk population.1,14 The WHO prequalification 
of a third kOCV (Euvichol; Eubiologics, Seoul, 
South Korea) in 2015, led to increased availability of these 
vaccines, opening the possibility for larger campaigns 
and the broader introduction of the vaccine in high-
burden areas.15
We present the results of a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of the published literature on the efficacy 
and effectiveness of kOCVs. Although the public health 
impact of kOCVs is derived from both the direct 
protection in vaccinated individuals and the indirect 
(herd) protection in both vaccinated and unvaccinated 
individuals, we focus this review on direct vaccine 
protection. We summarise the current state of evidence 
for kOCV protection to aid clinicians and public health 
decision makers to assess vaccine use at the individual 
and population levels.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
This systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the 
Cochrane Review Library databases on July 9, 2016, and 
ISI Web of Science on July 11, 2016, for articles containing 
“cholera” and “vaccine” and (“efficacy” or “effectiveness” 
or “protect”) in the title or abstract (appendix p 2). We 
imposed no restrictions on publication date or language 
in the initial search. We consulted GTFCC Oral Cholera 
Vaccine Working Group members to identify additional 
publications.
We defined vaccine efficacy as the relative reduction in 
medically attended confirmed cholera risk in individuals 
that received the vaccine versus those who did not, as 
estimated by a randomised clinical trial (RCT). We 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Killed oral cholera vaccines (kOCVs) are increasingly becoming a 
standard cholera prevention and control tool, although a clear 
synthesis of the evidence supporting the degree of vaccine-derived 
protection is not available. We searched PubMed and Embase 
electronic databases for articles in English, Spanish, French, or 
Chinese published before April 31, 2017, using the key words 
“cholera” and “vaccine” and (“efficacy” or “effectiveness” or 
“protect*”) in the title or abstract. We also consulted members of 
the WHO Global Task Force for Cholera Control Oral Cholera 
Vaccine Working Group for any additional publications that might 
have been missed by the search. We identified a variety of 
publications from efficacy and effectiveness studies of oral cholera 
vaccines. In addition, a single systematic review of oral cholera 
vaccines, both live and killed, was identified, which covered only 
early efficacy and safety trials. The results showed moderate 
vaccine efficacy 2 years after vaccination with two doses of kOCVs, 
and very scarce data from subsequent years were available. 
Children younger than 5 years were observed to have lower 
efficacy than those aged 5 years and older.
Added value of this study
Our study builds upon the previous review of the efficacy of 
kOCVs by incorporating the additional evidence (ten new 
manuscripts comprising eight new studies) published 
since 2010, including nearly all the evidence generated with the 
most widely used vaccine, Shanchol (Shantha Biotechnics, 
Hyderabad, India). In contrast to the previous review, our study 
incorporates field effectiveness studies that are of greater 
relevance to field use and includes subanalyses to help elucidate 
the heterogeneity in efficacy or effectiveness estimates. We 
found that average two-dose efficacy is similar during the first 
2 years after vaccination and begins to decline in the third year 
with positive, but not statistically significant, protection in the 
fourth year. However, by contrast, one large clinical trial 
estimated high levels of protection in the fifth year after 
vaccination. Short-term effectiveness (the first year after 
vaccination) is similar between one-dose and two-dose 
regimens. Even with the inclusion of new evidence, children 
younger than 5 years are only about half as protected as those 
aged 5 years and older. Finally, we found that the median age of 
cases enrolled in studies had a strong positive relationship with 
the estimated level of protection conferred by the vaccine, 
which helps explain some of the differences between estimates.
Implications of all the available evidence
kOCVs can provide medium to high levels of protection for at 
least 3 years, if not longer, when provided as the standard 
two-dose regimen. One dose can provide similar short-term 
protection to two doses, making it a practical option in 
outbreaks in which a rapid reduction in short-term risk is 
needed. More research is needed to understand duration of 
protection of both one-dose and two-dose regimens and to 
understand if and when booster doses should be provided.

defined vaccine effectiveness as the relative reduction in 
risk of medically attended confirmed cholera in 
vaccinated compared with unvaccinated individuals as 
measured by a case-control, cohort, or case-cohort study. 
We classified pragmatic RCTs as efficacy studies because 
they randomly allocated the vaccine. Confirmed cholera 
was defined as the presence of V cholerae in stool or rectal 
swab as determined by PCR, culture, or rapid diagnostic 
test.
Two reviewers (QB and EF) independently assessed each 
abstract for inclusion in the full text review, with differences 
resolved by discussion and consensus. Only abstracts in 
English, Spanish, French, or Chinese were reviewed. Each 
article was categorised and flagged for full text review if 
they reported direct or total vaccine efficacy16 from an RCT 
or effectiveness from an observational study. Duplicates 
were removed before abstract review using covidence 
software.
Data analysis
During the full text review, both reviewers independently 
extracted data from manuscripts with primary estimates 
of direct or total vaccine effectiveness or efficacy into 
an electronic database, with differences resolved by 
discussion and consensus. Estimates from secondary 
analyses of trials (eg, reanalyses presented in separate 
manuscripts) using alternative statistical methods or 
measures of protection were not extracted. We extracted 
relevant data from text, figures, and tables, and contacted 
authors when data were missing.
 We extracted the primary efficacy or effectiveness 
estimates from each study, and all secondary estimates by 
number of vaccine doses, duration, and age group. The 
main outcomes from these meta-analyses are average 
efficacy and effectiveness of two kOCV doses. Given the 
multiple estimates, and often multiple manuscripts, from 
each study, we focused the primary analyses on estimates 
of two-dose protection reflecting the duration of the 
primary study endpoint. For each estimate we extracted the 
following data: study design, study site, inclusion criteria, 
vaccine type (whole-cell or whole-cell with B-subunit 
[WC-BS]), vaccination period, study follow-up period, 
method of case confirmation, efficacy or effectiveness 
estimate and 95% CIs, number of vaccinated or 
unvaccinated patients or controls, number of doses, delay 
between doses (if more than one), vaccine coverage, age 
distribution of cases, and serotype and biotype distribution 
of cases.
Two reviewers (QB and ASA) independently assessed 
the risk of bias for each study, using the Newcastle-
Ottawa Scale for observational studies and the Cochrane 
Collaboration’s tool for RCTs. We produced funnel plots 
with primary (two-dose) outcomes to visually assess 
evidence for publication bias.
We used the reported point estimates of vaccine efficacy 
or effectiveness and 95% CIs to calculate the standard 
error of each. For studies reporting one-sided CIs, 
we reconstructed two-sided 95% CIs using standard 
(asymptotic) methods.17 Conditional on these standard 
errors, we estimated the average vaccine efficacy and 
effectiveness separately using random effect models with 
an empirical Bayes estimator of the between-study variance 
(τ²) using the metafor package in R.18,19 We assessed 
heterogeneity using the I² statistic, which is interpreted as 
the proportion of the total variation in the estimates that is 
due to the heterogeneity between studies rather than 
sampling variance.19 We tested for differences between 
subgroups (eg, vaccine type, age group, or number of 
doses) by fitting linear meta-regression models with the 
subgroup added as a moderator, and did a Wald test for the 
subgroup effect estimate.20 Given that individual estimates 
of vaccine protection pertain to protection over different 
timeframes from vaccination, we calculated the inverse-
variance weighted mean duration of each average estimate 
to aid the interpretation of our results.
We explored the association between the vaccine 
protection estimates, median age of cases, and duration 
of the study through visual assessment of the relationships 
and linear regression models with polynomial splines. 
For one study that reported estimates from each of the 
5 years of follow-up,6 we used a linear regression model 
with the log of the median age of patients as an 
independent variable to estimate the association with 
vaccine efficacy.
This study is registered in the systematic review 
registry PROSPERO (2016:CRD42016048232).

Results
We identified 6223 records through the database search 
and one through consultation with experts (figure 1). 
34 publications were eligible for full-text review and 
19 met the inclusion criteria for data abstraction. 
We 
extracted 
data 
from 
seven 
clinical 
trials 
(13 publications5,6,9,10,25–33) and six observational studies 
(six publications7,8,34–37). Two of the clinical trials were done 
in South America and five were in Asia; observational 
studies were done in Africa (four), Asia (one), and the 
Caribbean (one).
The seven efficacy studies included in the analyses 
were randomised placebo-controlled trials5,9,25,28,29 except 
for two with no placebo,26,27 and randomisation was at the 
individual5,9,25,28 or household and neighbourhood6,26,27 
levels. In all efficacy studies, cholera was culture 
confirmed. Two trials included a three-dose regimen as 
their primary endpoint,5,9 four used two doses6,25,26,27 and 
one used one dose.28 The duration between the first 
two vaccine doses in trials ranged from 14 to 42 days.6,9

Two studies had a low risk of bias across all domains of 
study quality,28,29 three had a low risk of bias across most 
domains but at least one area with an unclear risk of 
bias,5,25,30 and two had at least one domain with a high risk 
of bias (appendix p 5).26,27
The six effectiveness studies eligible for analysis 
included four case-control studies,7,8,35,36 one cohort 
study,34 and one case-cohort study.37 Most studies enrolled 
all individuals seeking care for diarrhoea at study health 
centres as suspected cholera cases then confirmed by 
stool culture, except two studies that used PCR37 and 
rapid diagnostic tests7 in their main analyses. Controls in 
case-control studies included people with no diarrhoea 
matched spatially to patients’ residences,7,8,35 and clinic-
based controls with non-cholera diarrhoea.36 Five studies 
included effectiveness of a two-dose regimen as their 
primary endpoint,7,8,34–36 and one study used a single-dose 
regimen.37 The duration between the two primary vaccine 
doses in observational studies ranged from 12 to 
25 days.34,35 Three of the six studies7,8,35 had a low risk of 
selection bias and four7,8,35,37 had a low risk of bias related 
to the comparability of the groups both in the design and 
analysis. None of the case-control studies adequately 
reported on response rates for both cases and controls to 
judge the risk of bias. The cohort and the case-cohort 
studies had an unclear risk of bias because of inadequate 
reporting on the quality of the cohort follow-up and 
potential differences between participants who were lost 
to follow-up and those who remained in the cohort 
(appendix p 6).
Primary estimates of two-dose regimens were available 
in six RCTs5,25–27,30,31 and five observational studies7,8,34–36 
(tables 1, 2). Observational study estimates pertained to 
protection for 5–34 months after vaccination, with an 
18-month weighted mean duration (figure 2). Trial 
estimates pertained to protection for 4–36 months, with a 
28-month weighted mean duration (figure 2). The 
average two-dose efficacy was 58% (95% CI 42–69, 
I²=58%) and the average two-dose effectiveness was 76% 
(62–85, I²=0). Two-dose estimates did not differ 
significantly by vaccine type (p=0·53, whole-cell vs WC-
BS); however, they varied by study design (p=0·04, 
observational vs randomised designs). We did sensitivity 
analyses excluding trials using the WC-BS vaccines and 
found that the average two-dose efficacy (57·4%, 
weighted mean duration 28 months) and effectiveness 
(72·3%, weighted mean duration 22 months) were 
similar, although slightly lower than the those from the 
combined analyses. We found no signs of publication 
bias from a visual assessment of funnel plots (appendix 
p 4) for observational studies and RCTs, separately.
One efficacy study28 and one effectiveness study37 
used protection after one dose of kOCV as a primary 
outcome, both only providing estimates of short-term pro-
tection (6 months28 and 2 months37). Other studies 
provided 
esti 
mates 
of 
one-dose 
pro 
tection 
as 
secondary 
outcomes, 
including 
four 
observational 
studies7,8,34,36 and one RCT.28 Two studies containing one-
dose efficacy estimates (or data sufficient to estimate 
efficacy) did not meet inclusion criteria for the outcome of 
medically attended confirmed cholera.25,21 Given the 
paucity of evidence of longer-term single-dose protection, 
and the global discussions around single-dose use in 
outbreaks, we focused on estimating the short-term 
protection (up to 1 year after vaccination). The average 
short-term effectiveness of one-dose kOCV was 69% 
(95% CI 35–85, I²=62%), although this conservatively 
included only two estimates of cumulative effectiveness 
Figure 1: PRISMA flow chart highlighting details of the systematic review 
and data abstraction process
Of the four studies that did not meet the study design inclusion criteria, one was 
excluded because it included medically attended cases and those detected from 
active surveillance in a clinical trial,21 one was excluded because of a 
non-standard study design,22 the others23,24 only used suspected, not confirmed 
cholera, as the study endpoint. The 359 other studies related to cholera vaccine 
that did not match eligibility criteria included commentaries, reviews, policy 
pieces, computational modelling, and studies with non-cholera outcomes 
related to any cholera vaccine.

spanning over 1 year (figure 3D).8,34 The only published 
one-dose clinical trial estimated 6-month efficacy of 40% 
(95% CI 11–60; figure 3B). Estimates did not vary 
significantly by study design (p=0·47, randomised trial vs 
observational). 
The 
average 
short-term 
one-dose 
effectiveness (69% [95% CI 35–85]; figure 3D) is similar to 
that of two doses (83% [79–91]; p=0·31; figure 3C), 
although all evidence comes from populations in which 
cholera transmission regularly occurs (ie, immunologically 
primed populations).
We identified two efficacy studies that used three kOCV 
doses.5,9 One study provided three doses, each 6 weeks 
apart (including whole-cell and WC-BS groups).9 After 
3 years, the results of that study showed that the efficacy 
was not significantly different between two and three doses 
(64% vs 50%) for the WC-BS group of the study, but two-
dose efficacy was significantly lower than three-dose 
efficacy for the whole-cell group (39% vs 52%).30 The 
second study provided a third dose as a booster 10 months 
after the primary two-dose series and found that efficacy 
2 years after the first dose was 82% (95% CI 27–95).5
The average efficacy estimates of kOCV were similar 
during the first 2 years after vaccination (figure 3; appendix 
p 4), with estimates of 56% (95% CI 42–66, I²=45%) in the

first year and 59% (49–67, I²=0) in the second year. The 
efficacy reduced to 39% (95% CI 13 to 57, I²=48%) in the 
third year, and 26% (–46 to 63, I²=74%) in the fourth year, at 
which point the estimates of efficacy became highly variable 
between studies and the average efficacy confidence 
interval crossed zero. Only one study reported efficacy 
during the fifth year, which was 81% (95% CI 41–94).6
Age-group-specific 
estimates 
of 
protection 
were 
reported by five studies,25–27,30,31 with most dividing age 
groups into ages younger than 5 years, 5–15 years, and 
older than 15 years. We estimated the average efficacy of 
kOCV in children younger than 5 years to be 30% (95% CI 
15–42; I²=0%, weighted mean duration of estimate 
31 months), which is significantly less (p<0·0001) than in 
people aged 5 years or older (64%; 95% CI 58–70; I²=0%, 
weighted mean duration 34 months), including estimates 
of efficacy in people aged 15 years and older (appendix 
p 3). The average effectiveness in children younger than 
5 years is 78% (95% CI –37 to 96, I²=0%, weighted mean 
duration 9 months), which is similar (p=0·77) to the 
effectiveness in individuals aged 5 years or older (70%, 
44 to 84; I²=0%, weighted mean duration 14 months). 
However, the estimate for children younger than 5 years 
comes from only two studies containing a total of 
18 patients younger than 5 years.8,35 In school-aged 
children (aged 5–15 years), the average efficacy is 80% 
(95% CI 41–93), based on results of only two trials.27,29
Given the differences in protection by age, we 
investigated whether the age distribution of cases within 
each study could explain the heterogeneity in efficacy or 
effectiveness estimates. Most studies did not report these 
data; however, authors of seven of the ten studies provided 
the requested data.6,7,9,27,34,36,37 We found that, in general, the 
older the patients, the higher the estimated protection 
(figure 4). The clearest example of this comes from the 
5-year trial in Kolkata,6 in which a simple linear model 
predicts a rise of 2·0 percentage points (95% CI 0·55–3·4, 
adjusted r²=0·82) in efficacy for each 10% increase in the 
median age. Additional analyses are needed to explore this 
relationship between increasing age and efficacy, given 
that the data within studies (eg, the estimates from year to 
year) are correlated and that we used only a sample of data 
which we were able to obtain from study authors.
Discussion
Our analyses provide a summary of the available evidence 
on the protection conferred by kOCVs and help clarify 
the observed difference in estimates. We found that 
kOCVs administered as the standard two-dose regimen 
provide a moderate to high level of protection for at least 
3 years, with some evidence suggesting longer lasting 
protection. A one-dose regimen provides significant 
short-term protection, although no studies with a 
primary endpoint of one-dose protection after longer 
than 6 months have been published. Two-dose efficacy is 
significantly less in children younger than 5 years than in 
people 5 years or older.
The choice of using a one-dose or two-dose regimen is 
difficult, particularly during outbreaks in regions where 
supplies are scarce.11,38,39 Our estimates of the short-term 
(up to 1 year after vaccination) average one-dose and 
two-dose effectiveness are similar; however, this 
comparison was not possible for efficacy studies because 
of scarce data. When short-term protection is needed and 
two doses cannot be provided to everyone at risk, our 
results suggest that a single dose will provide some if not 
the same level of short-term protection. Most evidence 
for the one-dose regimen comes from observational 
studies. More evidence from randomised trials is needed 
to corroborate increasing evidence that supports the 
strong protection conferred by a one-dose regimen. One 
study compared the short-term efficacy of three doses of 
whole-cell and WC-BS vaccines, and concluded that the 
inclusion of the B-subunit might have increased 
short-term protection.10 If this finding reflects a true 
difference, a single-dose WC-BS vaccine could provide a

95% CIs in the figure and used for meta-analyses are not necessarily the same as 
those in the original study because they were based on a reconstruction of a 
two-sided 95% CI from estimates of the standard error of the estimate from 
each study. All estimates (except for those from Clemens and colleagues,30 
1990a and 1990b) use the main vaccine dose used in the study. Qadri and 
colleagues’27 estimate is an estimate of total protection including both direct 
and indirect effects. Observational study effectiveness estimates had an 
18-month weighted mean duration, and the trial efficacy estimates had a 
28-month weighted mean duration.

more protective alternative than a whole-cell only vaccine. 
Whether and when to provide a booster dose remains an 
open question and might vary by the degree to which the 
population has previously been exposed to V cholerae. 
New evidence on the duration of protection by one-dose 
and two-dose regimens will enhance the ability to make 
better decisions on when each should be used and at 
what intervals booster doses should be provided.
kOCVs, like other oral vaccines,40 provide less protection 
to children younger than 5 years than to people aged 
5 years or older. This differential protection by age might 
have implications for deciding between different 
vaccination strategies, particularly when kOCVs become 
more broadly used in highly endemic countries, such as 
Bangladesh. Vaccination of young children, despite the 
lower efficacy, might still have substantial effects on 
disease burden, because of indirect (herd) effects.41 More 
work is needed to refine estimates of the differential 
protection by age, to improve understanding of the effect 
of different age-targeted vaccine delivery strategies, and 
to understand whether alternative dosing regimens, such 
as the provision of a third dose, might enhance protection 
in young children.
The local epidemiology of cholera, including the 
pathways of transmission and the transmission intensity, 
can determine which age groups are at highest risk of 
becoming infected.42 In highly cholera-endemic settings 
such as Bangladesh and India, people with cholera tend 
to be younger, since older adults benefit from protection 
conferred by previous exposure to V cholerae. Given that 
efficacy of kOCVs is age dependent, the distribution of 
the age of affected people probably shapes estimates of

protection from studies done in different settings 
(appendix pp 3–4). Frequent exposure in endemic areas 
can act to boost vaccine-induced immunity and prolong 
duration of vaccine protection, and might influence the 
apparent protection from the vaccine. These phenomena, 
in addition to the differences in the durations of the 
studies, might explain why the two-dose effectiveness is 
higher than that of two-dose efficacy (figure 2). India is 
the only country in which both two-dose efficacy31 and 
effectiveness36 studies were done, and protection 
estimates after about 3 years were very similar (69%36 
and 66%31), showing that local epidemiology might 
explain apparent differences between study designs.
We identified moderate to high levels of heterogeneity 
between individual study estimates of vaccine protection 
within the primary two-dose efficacy analysis and within 
the average one-dose effectiveness analysis. Although 
some of the heterogeneity is explained by the duration of 
the study and the average age of patients, other 
unidentified factors probably also had a role. One outlier 
in the primary two-dose efficacy analysis, a trial done in 
Peru,25 found no protection during the 10 months after 
vaccination. The study25 assessed an early vaccine variant 
produced before large-scale dedicated production existed. 
Clemens and colleagues43 suggested that misclassification 
of outcomes within this massive household-based active 
surveillance programme (with twice weekly visits to 
households of 18 000 individuals) might have biased the 
results towards no effect.
This systematic review builds upon the 2011 Cochrane 
review44 
of 
oral 
cholera 
vaccination 
efficacy 
by 
incorporating four new manuscripts6,27,28,31 and two new 
clinical trials done since 2010 and including six field-
effectiveness studies from a wider geographical scope, 
which provide measures of vaccine protection that are 
relevant to public health. Our estimates of two-dose 
efficacy and findings of low efficacy in children younger 
than 5 years are similar to those reported in the 
2011 Cochrane review,44 which strengthens the rationale 
to look for alternative protection for young children 
through either herd immunity or the development of new 
vaccines. Additionally, we did subanalyses for protection 
by number of doses, age group, study type, and duration 
of protection to help explain some of the heterogeneity in 
estimates seen in the literature. This summary of the 
evidence is particularly timely because of the increases in 
global supply of kOCVs, and the increasing interest in 
incorporating its use into national cholera control plans 
in areas that have cholera outbreaks regularly.
This systematic review had multiple limitations. Given 
the few available studies and their diversity in study 
design, duration of follow-up, vaccine type, and 
epidemiological settings, we were unable to fully control 
for each factor in estimating the true average effect. We 
presented stratified estimates to help interpret how each 
factor might influence estimates of kOCV protection. In 
our analyses of single-dose protection, we combined 
estimates of one-dose protection from studies in which it 
was the primary outcome and studies in which it was a 
secondary outcome. Especially in observational settings, 
these secondary estimates are from individuals who did 
not get the full vaccine regimen, which might be 
correlated with cholera risk. If these data were from 
people who did not get the full regimen, we might have 
underestimated the average single-dose protection. 
Similarly, using both vaccine groups from the Matlab 
study30 without accounting for correlation between them 
(shared placebo group) led to slight underestimation of 
the variance in the average efficacy estimates. Last, 
although no significant differ 
ences between protection 
estimates using different vaccines were detected, the 
increase in antigen protection over time and the addition 
of the B-subunit might account for some undetected 
differences that this study was underpowered to detect. 
However, average two-dose estimates excluding the WC-
BS vaccines were similar to the estimates pertaining to a 
combination of both vaccines.
In conclusion, kOCVs are effective in reducing the risk 
of cholera. Although vaccination alone will probably not 
lead to elimination of cholera, it can provide an important 
stopgap while improved water, sanitation, and health-
care infrastructure are provided to vulnerable popu-
lations. More work is needed to understand how and 
when to best use existing vaccines and to design new and 
more effective ones. However, the past three decades of 
evidence points towards kOCV being a safe, effective, 
and important tool to fight cholera.
