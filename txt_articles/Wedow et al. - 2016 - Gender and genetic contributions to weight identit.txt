Abstract
In this paper, we investigate the possibility that genetic variation contributes to self-perceived 
weight status among adolescents and young adults in the U.S. Using samples of identical and 
fraternal twins across four waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult 
Health (Add Health) study, we calculate heritability estimates for objective body mass index 
(BMI) that are in line with previous estimates. We also show that perceived weight status is 
heritable (h2 ~ 0.47) and most importantly that this trait continues to be heritable above and 
beyond objective BMI (h2 ~ 0.25). We then demonstrate significant sex differences in the 
heritability of weight identity across the four waves of the study, where h2women =0.39, 0.35, 0.40, 
and 0.50 for each wave, respectively, and h2men =0.10, 0.10, 0.23, and 0.03. These results call for a 
deeper consideration of both identity and gender in genetics research.

1. Introduction
Health scientists have long relied upon self-rated health (SRH) as a global indicator of 
overall well-being (Idler and Benyamini, 1997)—largely because self-reported health 
measures are consistently found to be at least as valid as physician assessed morbidity 
(Ferraro and Farmer, 1999), and SRH is strongly associated with overall mortality risk (Idler 
and Angel, 1990). A growing body of work has started to investigate self-ratings of health,

 and this work has shown important differences by age, gender, and specific morbidities 
(Chang and Christakis, 2003; Lee et al., 2010; Nelson et al., 2008). Because certain 
individuals’ health assessments are relatively rigid even in the face of new information about 
changes in objective health status (Boardman, 2006), scholars have argued that these 
measures tap into a more complex phenomenon that has been characterized as a “health 
identity” (McMullen and Luborsky, 2006). This argument is in line with the results of a 
recent study by Altman, Van Hook, and Hillemeier (2016), who show that obesity status is a 
critical part of the subjective component of health assessments, and that this relationship is 
consistent regardless of historical period. Grover, Keel, and Mitchell (2003) have argued that 
“weight identity” is, like health identity, a stable component of personal identity.
In this paper, we evaluate the possibility that variation, not just in weight itself but in weight 
identity, may be due in part to genetic variation in the population, and we examine gender 
differences in the heritability of weight identity. We use sibling-based quantitative genetic 
models to illustrate the importance of this genetic connection for social epidemiologic 
understandings of health assessments in general and weight identity in particular.
1.1. Health identity and weight identity
Social scientists have detailed the ways in which multiple and competing social roles, 
statuses, and life circumstances coalesce to define one’s identity (Goffman, 1959). More 
recently, researchers have made it clear that current health, health lifestyles, and healthcare 
interactions are all important components of overall health identity (Kelleher and Leavey, 
2004). Critically, physical weight is consistently linked to overall health assessment 
(Altman, Van Hook, and Hillemeier, 2016; McMullen and Luborsky, 2006), and lifestyle 
indicators such as food choice are increasingly important signals of one’s health identity 
(Stead et al., 2011). Further, the connection between health self-assessments and identity is 
important to medical sociology and social epidemiology. Self-assessments about current 
health have two components: (1) a spontaneous assessment; and (2) an enduring self-concept 
(Bailis et al., 2003). This latter component is particularly important, because it suggests that 
simple questions about one’s health, including one’s weight, may tap into complex health-
related identities that are relatively stable over time. Nonetheless, some individuals may be 
more likely than others to adjust their health self-assessments in light of new information, 
new life events, or changes in health status.
Previous work has demonstrated the stability of SRH as an enduring self-concept by 
evaluating the association between health assessments and reported morbidities and co-
morbidities over time (Boardman, 2006). In this paper, we demonstrate the stability of 
weight identity by examining residual variation in subjective weight status (e.g., “Overall, 
how do you think of yourself in terms of your weight?”) after adjusting for objective BMI.
1.2. Genetics and identity
Results of a meta-analysis suggest that the heritability of subjective well-being is between 
30% and 50% (Nes et al., 2006). That is, roughly one-third to one-half of the variance of 
subjective well-being in the population may be due to genetic variation. Yet the idea that 
health identity reflects a genetic component is rarely considered in the social sciences. Our

 study addresses this limitation by ascertaining for the first time the proportion of variance in 
weight identity that may be genetically influenced. Researchers have made gains in their 
efforts to assess the genetic origins of environmental sensitivity (Belsky and Pluess, 2009; 
Boyce and Ellis, 2005; Shanahan and Hofer, 2005), but very little work has considered 
health identities such as weight identity within this overall framework. This is very 
important because those who are less flexible in their health or weight identity may be less 
likely than others to make significant changes to improve or maintain their health 
(Boardman et al., 2011; Boardman et al., 2012). By studying the two phenotypes of 
objective BMI as well as one’s own perceived weight status, we examine the possibilities 
that the covariation between these traits is due, in part, to common genetic influences, and 
more importantly, that unique genetic influences contribute to subjective weight identity. 
That is, we explore the idea that some of the tendency to be open to change in weight self-
assessment may have roots in observed or unobserved genotype.
1.3. Differential susceptibility and social triggers
The social trigger model of gene-environment interaction (GxE) anticipates that latent 
genetic influences manifest only when triggered by the individual’s environment. For 
example, the differential susceptibility model of GxE interaction suggests that some 
individuals possess more “plasticity” alleles, making these individuals similar to orchids, 
while others that possess relatively fewer resemble resilient dandelions (Belsky and Pluess, 
2009). Given relatively average environments, these two groups of individuals would be 
expected to fare similarly, but when exposed to either beneficial or hostile social triggers, the 
genetic differences between individuals will manifest. Given the allure of such theoretical 
models for social scientists, the past decade has witnessed an explosion of research on GxE 
interactions (Manuck and McCaffery, 2014). The initial molecular empirical work evaluated 
polymorphisms in specific candidate genes that were hypothesized to moderate 
environmental influences on specific morbidities. Perhaps the most highly cited works in 
this area are two papers from Caspi and colleagues, which sought to demonstrate that certain 
genetic polymorphisms made individuals particularly sensitive to stimuli from the social as 
well as the physical environment. Though the replicability of this work is debatable, it 
emphasized noxious environmental exposures including stressful life events (Caspi et al., 
2003) and serious forms of maltreatment among children (Caspi et al., 2002).
The results of these two studies have led to hundreds of attempted replications with mixed 
results (Risch et al., 2009), discussions about the plausible biological mechanisms of the 
purported GxE effects (Meaney, 2010), sharp criticisms about the likelihood of Type-I errors 
in underpowered and unreplicated gene-environment studies (Duncan and Keller, 2011), 
calls to extend the meaning of the environment to include social forces (Boardman, Daw, 
and Freese, 2013), and refinements to the emphasis on stressful environments (Pluess and 
Belsky, 2011). While these debates continue, there is growing consensus that a complete 
understanding of complex behavioral phenotypes requires information on the genetic 
architecture of individuals and the social contexts in which they interact (Landecker and 
Panofsky, 2013).

 A number of replicated empirical regularities have emerged from twin and family studies, 
which are well-positioned to explore aggregate genetic architecture (even if the specific 
genetic markers are unknown). For example, heritability tends to increase with age (e.g., 
Bergen, Gardner, and Kendler, 2007; Briley and Tucker-Drob, 2013), and there is some 
evidence that heritabilities also differ across environmental context (e.g., Tucker-Drob and 
Bates, 2016; Tucker-Drob, Briley, and Harden, 2013). Rather than remaining fixed and 
static, genetic influences emerge across development as individuals encounter social 
triggers. Gender may also act as a social trigger. For example, the magnitude of genetic 
influences on some psychological measures, such as anxiety, depression, and aggressive 
behavior, differs across males and females (e.g., Eley, Lichtenstein, and Stevenson, 1999; 
Eley and Stevenson, 1999). One potential explanation of these findings is that biological 
processes link psychological development to the genome more strongly for either males or 
females. An equally plausible mechanism is that the social experience of being male or 
female differentially situates individuals within social environments that magnify or 
diminish genetic influences on development.
In the present paper, we propose that genetic sensitivity to social environmental factors may 
also contribute to identity formation in general and weight identity specifically. While only 
limited work has focused on genetics and identity, Settle, Dawes, and Fowler (2009) have 
found that intensity of partisan identification is a heritable phenotype, although the direction 
of the association is not heritable. That is, genes do not contribute to “liberal” or 
“conservative” ideologies; rather, genes seem to influence individuals’ propensity to express 
their political orientations as an important component of their identity. This work is in line 
with our understanding regarding the genetic contributions to the malleability of “identity 
negotiation,” and is comparable to other work on religious identities (Lewis and Bates, 
2013).
1.4. Weight identity by gender
Symbolic interaction research has demonstrated that individuals constantly negotiate their 
own identities in light of their social roles, environmental cues, and observations of others. 
These negotiations coalesce in a process in which individuals internalize putatively external 
elements of their social world (Mead, 1913). This work emphasizes the importance of a 
“master status” (Becker, 1963) but also underscores the need to consider identity across 
multiple social roles.
Among U.S. adolescents and young adults, weight identity negotiation is likely to vary 
systematically with gender. Weight status is much more salient for women than for men in 
the U.S., and women and men experience different social environments in regard to weight. 
Further, women are at higher risk of weight discrimination than men, and young women are 
at higher risk of weight discrimination at lower levels of BMI (Puhl, Andreyeva, and 
Brownell, 2008). These social realities are reflected in differential self-assessments of 
weight. For example, objectively overweight men are disproportionately inclined to report 
that they are “about the right weight” (Chang and Christakis, 2003).
We believe that increasing objective BMI affects weight identity only insofar as it is 
subjectively meaningful. Thus, in our study, we bring the social meaning of gender to bear

 on the GxE literature. Because weight status is more highly salient for women than for men, 
and being overweight is more highly stigmatized for women than for men, we anticipate that 
these differential expectations regarding weight will render different environments, and that 
these environments will thus drive gendered differences in our genetic analyses, so that the 
effect of genetic variation on weight identity will manifest most among women. That is, the 
social mechanisms that are necessary to observe the heritability of this identity phenotype 
will be much stronger for women than for men in the United States.
2. Data and Methods
2.1. Dataset
This study uses data from the (U.S.) National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult 
Health (Add Health). Add Health is a nationally representative and longitudinal sample of 
adolescents originally assessed in grades 7–12 during the 1994–1995 school year. This 
cohort was followed into young adulthood with four in-home interviews, and the Add Health 
dataset contains detailed information on respondents’ social, psychological, and physical 
well-being, with information on their families, neighborhoods, schools, and peer groups. 
Thus it provides a unique way to study how social environments and behaviors in young 
people are linked to health outcomes in adulthood. Importantly for our study, Add Health 
purposely oversampled twin pairs to enable the behavioral genetic analyses that we use in 
our study (Harris et al., 2006).
2.2 Empirical analyses
We use monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs in our analyses. In our final 
univariate and bivariate twin analyses we use a total of 286 MZ pairs, 251 same-sex DZ 
pairs, and 204 opposite-sex DZ pairs. Objective BMI was measured as a continuous outcome 
constructed from measured height and weight. Perceived weight status was assessed with the 
following response categories using the question “How do you think of yourself in terms of 
weight?” Response options included (1) “very underweight,” (2) “slightly underweight,” (3) 
“about the right weight,” (4) “slightly overweight,” or (5) “very overweight.”
Using twin modeling techniques in the structural equation modeling programs Mplus 7.4 
(Muthén and Muthén, 1998–2015) and OpenMx (Boker et al., 2011) with the R 3.2.0 
statistical program (R Core Team, 2016), we provide estimates for the genetic component 
(additive [A]) and two components of environmental influence (shared [C] and nonshared 
[E]) of our objective BMI and perceived weight status phenotypes. All of our models control 
for the main effects of age, sex, age2 and an age-×-sex interaction, as is standard in twin 
models (McGue and Bouchard, 1984). We compare nested models using χ2 difference tests 
to assess fit and arrive at the most parsimonious models. We estimate univariate models for 
each of the 4 waves of Add Health and provide standard errors for our parameter estimates.
We next fit bivariate twin models, or Cholesky triangular decomposition models, to 4 × 4 
covariance matrices. Here we use the most parsimonious models from our univariate 
analyses to inform the models we fit in our bivariate approach. In these models we 
decompose the variance-covariance matrix with regression of observed measures on latent

 factors in which we model a variance-covariance path that approximates the variance shared 
between our 2 phenotypes: objective and perceived weight (Purcell, 2008). As shown by 
diagramming the bivariate path model in Figure 1, in these models objective BMI and 
perceived weight status are observed. A, C, and E are the latent factors of additive genetic 
variation, shared environmental variation, and nonshared environmental variation, 
respectively. The a11 and a22 paths represent the additive genetic variation associated with 
objective BMI and residualized perceived weight status, respectively. Likewise, the c11, c22, 
e11, and e22 paths represent the environmental variation associated with objective BMI and 
residualized perceived weight status respectively. Put differently, the pathways specific to 
perceived weight status represent unique genetic and environmental influences that are not 
shared with objective BMI. Unique to the bivariate models, the covariance paths (a21, c21, 
and e21) represent genetic and environmental variation shared between objective BMI and 
perceived weight status, and these paths can be interpreted similarly to regression 
coefficients. When squared, the coefficients represent the proportion of variance in perceived 
weight status that is shared with objective BMI. These shared paths also allow us to estimate 
a genetic correlation coefficient (rg) that indicates the extent to which latent-factor variation 
(e.g., genetic influence) is shared between our two phenotypes. The paths described in 
Figure 1 can be used with Equation 1 to estimate the genetic correlation coefficient as:
(Equation 1)
Thus in these models we can get a sense of the amount of genetic variation that is 
influencing both objective BMI and perceived weight status at the same time. We estimate 
bivariate models across all 4 waves of Add Health and provide standard errors for our rg 
estimates.
As a final step, we investigate whether the above estimates of genetic and environmental 
influences are consistent across genders. In the behavior genetic literature, this phenomenon 
is referred to as a sex-limitation model (Neale and Cardon, 1992). Two forms of sex-
limitation are possible. First, qualitative sex-limitation refers to the possibility that different 
genetic influences matter for men and women. For example, different genes may regulate 
pubertal development across gender that also influences BMI, or the social experience of 
puberty may magnify different genetic influences across gender. Here, the main point is that 
the genetic variation that matters for BMI might differ across gender. Second, quantitative 
sex-limitation refers to the possibility that the magnitude of genetic or environmental 
influences may differ across gender. For example, genetic influences may exert a larger or 
smaller influence on BMI across gender due to a variety of biological or social mechanisms, 
but the same sort of genetic influences matter across gender. Testing for qualitative sex-
limitation requires opposite-sex DZ twin pairs and evaluates whether these pairs differ 
systematically from same-sex pairs. Quantitative sex-limitation estimates genetic and 
environmental effects separately across males and females. These models are nested and can 
be compared using χ2 difference tests.

 3. Results
Table 1 reports the twin pair descriptive statistics for our outcome phenotypes, objective 
BMI and perceived weight status. As we expected, BMI increased as twins aged, and thus 
mean BMI ranged from 22.10 to 28.03 across waves. Mean perceived weight status (on a 5-
point Likert Scale) ranged from 3.08 to 3.49 across waves, or from “about the right weight” 
to “slightly overweight.” Table 1 also reports the number of MZ, same-sex DZ, and opposite 
sex DZ twin pairs used for each phenotype by wave. Finally, we report MZ, same-sex DZ, 
and opposite sex DZ phenotypic correlations for each trait by wave. For objective BMI, 
phenotypic correlations were roughly 0.8 for MZ pairs and about 0.4 for same-sex DZ pairs. 
For perceived weight status, phenotypic correlations were on average about 0.5 for MZ pairs 
and about 0.25 for same-sex DZ twin pairs. Opposite sex DZ correlations were much lower 
than same-sex DZ correlations, an indication of sex differences. That the same-sex DZ 
correlations were on average about half the MZ correlations suggests that genetic influences 
are additive (Plomin et al., 1990). To check this observation, we procedurally fit a model for 
non-additive (dominance) genetic effects, and we find estimates of zero for the dominance 
genetic parameter, providing further evidence that an additive genetic model is the most 
appropriate.
Table 2 and Figure 2 present the results of our univariate models. The final three columns in 
Table 2 indicate model fit statistics for the ACE vs. the AE model. Because we were able to 
drop C from all of our univariate models without loss of model fit (last column in Table 2), 
we only present the results of the AE models in Table 2 and Figure 2. Heritability for 
objective BMI remains quite stable across all waves at about 0.80, and this value is 
consistent with previous estimates using these data (Haberstick et al., 2010) as well as with 
estimates for similarly aged populations across other settings (Min et al., 2013). As shown in 
Figure 2, confidence intervals, even with our somewhat small twin sample, remain tight 
(please see the standard errors in Table 2). For perceived weight status, heritability values 
again stay very stable across waves at about 0.45, suggesting that perceived weight status is 
more heavily influenced by environmental factors than is objective BMI. Confidence 
intervals and standard errors are again relatively small, although they are somewhat larger 
than the confidence intervals and standard errors for objective BMI. In both phenotypes we 
see significant genetic influence across all 4 waves of Add Health.
We present our first bivariate model in Table 3 for all respondents. In the first several 
columns, we present standard errors and path coefficients for both the additive genetic [A] 
and nonshared environmental [E] components of our model. In Figure 3, to highlight how 
these coefficients map onto our structural model, we present the Wave 1 [A] and [E] path 
coefficients, genetic and environmental correlations, and standard errors using the same 
diagramming as in Figure 1.
Next, using path coefficient-based equations (see Equations S1 and S2 in Section 1 of the 
online supplement), we calculate heritabilities for objective BMI and perceived weight status 
(Table 3). We find that these estimates are directly in line with the estimates from our 
univariate models in Table 2 and Figure 2, and this observation serves as a methodologically 
consistent robustness check. Unique to the Cholesky bivariate method, the shared variance-

 covariance paths (a21 and e21) allow for the determination of variance that is unique to 
perceived weight status, independent of objective BMI. We use the below equation to 
calculate this residual heritability estimate:
(Equation 2)
As reported in Table 3, we find consistent heritability estimates for this residual phenotype 
of 0.25, 0.21, 0.29, and 0.23 across each of our 4 waves, respectively. Importantly, these 
estimates indicate that perceived weight status contains a heritable component that is truly 
above and beyond either objective weight status or environmental influences. Further, these 
heritability estimates provide the first evidence that weight identity may have genetic 
underpinnings. (For a robustness check of this method, see Section 2 of the online 
supplement.) In Figure 4, we graphically decompose our bivariate results, splitting genetic 
and environmental variance into variance shared between objective BMI and perceived 
weight and variance unique to each of these phenotypes. The light gray portion of the bars in 
this figure correspond to genetic variance unique to perceived weight status.
Across each of the 4 waves our estimates of genetic correlation (rg) remains stable between 
0.78 and 0.85 with small and consistent standard errors. These rg values provide strong 
evidence that there is a substantial overlap between the genetic variance that is associated 
with BMI and the genetic variance that is associated with perceived weight status. Finally, 
using the path coefficients in Table 3, we can calculate a ratio of the genetic covariance 
between objective BMI and perceived weight status to the phenotypic correlation between 
the two traits (Plomin and DeFries, 1979):
(Equation 3)
For our bivariate model, Equation 3 yields consistent values of 0.88, 0.81, 0.76, and 0.81 
across our 4 waves, which suggests that a much of the observed phenotype covariance 
between our two traits is due to additive genetic influences. This result, in conjunction with 
the results for the residualized weight identity phenotype, supports the notion that the 
heritability of one component of weight identity operates above and beyond simple changes 
in physical weight.
We next turn toward the question of sex differences in the genetic influences on weight 
identity. First, we formally test for both qualitative and quantitative sex differences, or sex-
limitation, in our univariate models. We find weak evidence for either of these types of sex 
differences (for methodology and results, see Section 3 of the online supplement). Thus, we 
move to a more informative test of quantitative sex differences for our bivariate model. This 
test measures whether the additive genetic paths, including the a21 cross-path, are equivalent 
across males and females. Put differently, this test assesses whether gender moderates the 
relation between the genetic variance in objective BMI and perceived weight status. In order

 to perform this test, we fix the additive genetic bivariate pathways (a11, a21, and a22) and 
similar environmental pathways across males and females to be equal. We then compare the 
χ2 statistic of this model to a model where we freely estimate each of these parameters. As 
shown in Table 4 below, in general we find strong and statistically significant evidence that 
we cannot fix these parameters to be equal, and therefore that genetic and environmental 
effects on objective BMI and perceived weight status differ greatly across gender in our 
bivariate model. (For a robustness check of this test, see Section 4 of the online supplement). 
There are two other important takeaways from this test. First, it appears that gender 
moderates the association between the genetic variance related to objective BMI and the 
genetic variance related to perceived weight status. Second, in the case of our bivariate 
model, any differences between the genetic influences for men and women come as a result 
of residual genetic variation in perceived weight status. In other words, genetic variation in 
weight identity that is unique to perceived weight status and independent of objective BMI is 
driving any gendered, genetic differences we might observe in our 2 phenotypes.
Having established statistically significant gender differences in genetic variance, we re-
estimate the parameters of our bivariate model, this time separately for men and women. In 
Table 5, we report these results similarly to the full bivariate model. The heritability 
estimates in this table show that the amount of genetic variance related to objective BMI is 
relatively similar for men and women, with gender differences ranging only from about 0.05 
to 0.10 across the 4 waves. For the heritability of perceived weight status, gender differences 
are more extreme, this time ranging from about 0.10 to 0.25 across waves. Most strikingly, 
and in line with what we expect from our sex-limitation tests, the genetic variation that is 
unique to perceived weight status (independent of objective BMI) differs the most by gender. 
For these heritability estimates, we see gender differences ranging from about 0.20 all the 
way to 0.50 across waves. Further, these heritability values for men are about 0.10 on 
average, while for women the average is about 0.40. These results confirm that, for women, 
the genetic influences on perceived weight that are unique to perceived weight and not 
shared with objective physical weight are significantly greater than for men. Put another 
way, genetic variability in weight identity is much higher for young women than for young 
men in the United States. As previous researchers have noted (Perry, 2015; Perry et al., 
2013; Perry, 2016; Short, Yang, and Jenkins, 2013), this gender-specific genetic association 
is perfectly in line with a sociological understanding of gender as a critical environmental 
moderator of biological processes and reflects the salience of weight identity for women in 
the United States.
In Figure 5, we again graphically decompose our bivariate results where the light gray 
portion of the bars correspond to the portion of genetic variance that is unique to perceived 
weight status by gender. Finally, we note that the average genetic correlation for men across 
the 4 waves is 0.92, while for women the average genetic correlation is 0.73. In other words, 
for women the percentage of the genetic variation between objective BMI and perceived 
weight status that is due to common genetic factors that influence both traits is much lower 
than for men. That the average genetic correlation values are different and much lower for 
women adds a final piece of support that, for young women in particular, genetic variation in 
perceived weight status operates above and beyond simple changes in physical weight.

 4. Discussion
Our results demonstrate strong links between objective measures of BMI and subjective 
perception of weight status. Individuals with higher BMI view themselves as somewhat 
more overweight, and this association is mediated through common genetic effects. Beyond 
genetic effects, we consistently find a positive nonshared environmental association across 
four waves of data and across males and females. This effect represents the tendency for 
(genetically identical) twins with higher BMI to also perceive themselves as overweight. 
Over and above these links with BMI, we find residual genetic and environmental effects on 
subjective weight perception. This result implies that individuals vary in the sensitivity of 
identify formation processes to objective facts, and the relative contributions of genetic and 
environmental factors to such processes differ across men and women. In this case, we 
believe that patterned differences in the social meaning of weight are reflected in gender 
differences in the observable contributions of genetics to weight identity.
While it has long been understood at the molecular level that genes play a role in shaping 
biological development and human disease, social scientists and epidemiologists have made 
it clear that health outcomes are affected not just by biological mechanisms, but also by 
social and environmental factors (Boardman et al., 2013). The differential susceptibility 
model adds that people with different genotypes may have biologically differential responses 
to the same environment, and thus demonstrates that understanding complex phenotypes like 
health requires simultaneous consideration of social and biological inputs. Our investigation 
is important because as Idler and Benyamini (1997) and many others have shown, health 
assessments are independent and robust predictors of adult mortality; how one evaluates 
one’s own health has critical and lasting consequences, because it shapes one’s health 
management decisions. If subjective health identities are “sticky” (Bailis et al., 2003)—not 
always reflecting actual health states, or changes in health states—it is important to 
understand why.
We recognize that other explanations for our results are possible. In particular, it could be 
that observed differences reflect global health assessments rather than a more narrowly 
defined weight identity (Mosing et al., 2010). To explore this possibility, in ancillary 
analyses, we estimated comparable bivariate Cholesky models with self-rated health and 
weight identity, and we calculated an rg of 0.44, 0.64, 0.58, and 0.64 for waves 1–4 
respectively. Thus, although these two phenotypes are correlated (r about 0.16 – 0.27 across 
waves), and this association is derived from common sources of genetic variation, these 
analyses are consistent with the idea that weight identity is a unique phenotype above and 
beyond a general perception of physical health.
Further, the literature points toward gendered mismatches in weight reporting whereby men 
are likely to overestimate their weight (Merrill and Richardson, 2009; Shapiro and 
Anderson, 2003). Accordingly, it is likely some gender-related measurement error exists in 
our subjective weight assessment outcome variables. However, we believe that this 
misreporting most likely reflects the gendered social environment surrounding weight, and is 
thus part of the environmental factors behind the gendered genetic outcomes we observe in 
our study. Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind the mechanisms behind such

 measurement errors and how they might affect the parameter estimates. If misreporting of 
weight perception falls neatly along gender lines, then only opposite-sex twin pairs would be 
affected. This process may explain our (somewhat weak) evidence of qualitative sex 
limitation. Same-sex pairs would not be biased by such an effect if it applies equally to all 
members of a gender because, while shifting the means for weight perception, it would not 
affect the covariance matrix from which the models derive information. Importantly, our 
primary results held when only same-sex pairs were analyzed. If such a bias does not apply 
to all members of a gender equally, then the nonshared environmental link between BMI and 
subjective weight perception may break down. Said differently, this source of error implies 
that some men need to gain even more weight than their (identical) twin to report a higher 
subjective weight perception compared to their twin. In fact, we do see in our results that 
this nonshared environmental connection is weaker for men (average e21 = .22) compared to 
women (average e21 = .31).
Finally, we note that it in era of increasing access to molecular genetic data, it is important to 
consider both the strengths and the limitations of the twin model and to compare these 
models to methods that utilize measured genetic data. For readers interested in this topic, we 
provide a detailed discussion in Section 5 of the online supplement.
5. Conclusion
To date, few researchers have conceptualized genetics as contributing to identity formation, 
and even fewer have extended this conceptualization to the realm of health identity. We 
emphasize that suggesting a role for genetics does not mean that identities do not and cannot 
change; it instead reflects social science paradigms built around the idea that not all 
individuals respond to the same environments in the same way—and that the sources of this 
heterogeneity are theoretically and empirically important. We propose that genetic variance 
influences subjective health assessments, and in particular, weight and health identity. We 
further show that the extent to which genetic variance plays a role in weight identity depends 
on gender. This research is of particular importance because what constitutes a healthy body 
size is determined in part by the social contexts in which one lives, works, and socializes 
(Qvortrup, 2010). These factors ultimately affect what individuals do to monitor and manage 
their own weight (Levine, Smolak, and Hayden, 1994). We are optimistic that we have 
developed a solid starting place for empirically investigating genetic contributions to weight 
and health identities.
Finally, we end on a note that we believe is critical and often neglected in any social science 
genetics study. In 1979 the prolific economist Arthur Goldberger noted a growing concern 
for the interpretation of genetic results, a concern which still plagues interpretations even 
today. In line with Goldberger’s critique, we caution against committing the naturalistic 
fallacy when interpreting genetic results, or concluding that simply because a phenotype 
might, in part, have a natural cause, policy has little scope to affect an outcome. While 
genetic variation plays a role in almost any phenotype (Turkheimer, 2000), the extent to 
which the social environment affects these phenotypes is ever-changing, and policy can and 
will always have an important role in shaping phenotypic outcomes.
