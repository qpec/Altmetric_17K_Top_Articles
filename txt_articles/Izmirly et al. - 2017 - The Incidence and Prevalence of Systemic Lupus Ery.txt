Objective. The
Manhattan
Lupus
Surveillance
Program (MLSP) is a population-based registry designed
to determine the prevalence of systemic lupus erythema-
tosus (SLE) in 2007 and the incidence from 2007 to 2009
among residents of New York County (Manhattan), New
York, and to characterize cases by race/ethnicity, includ-
ing Asians and Hispanics, for whom data are lacking.
Methods. We
identified
possible
SLE
cases
from hospital records, rheumatologist records, and
administrative databases. Cases were defined according
to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)
classification criteria, the Systemic Lupus International
Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) classification criteria,
or the treating rheumatologist’s diagnosis. Rates among
Manhattan residents were age-standardized, and
capture–recapture analyses were conducted to assess
case underascertainment.
Results. By
the
ACR
definition,
the
age-
standardized prevalence and incidence rates of SLE were
62.2 and 4.6 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. Rates
were ~9 times higher in women than in men for preva-
lence (107.4 versus 12.5) and incidence (7.9 versus 1.0).
Compared with non-Hispanic white women (64.3), preva-
lence was higher among non-Hispanic black (210.9), His-
panic (138.3), and non-Hispanic Asian (91.2) women.
Incidence rates were higher among non-Hispanic black
women (15.7) compared with non-Hispanic Asian (6.6),
Hispanic (6.5), and non-Hispanic white (6.5) women.
Capture–recapture adjustment increased the prevalence
and incidence rates (75.9 and 6.0, respectively). Alternate
SLE definitions without capture–recapture adjustment
revealed higher age-standardized prevalence and inci-
dence rates (73.8 and 6.2, respectively, by the SLICC defi-
nition and 72.6 and 5.0 by the rheumatologist definition)
than the ACR definition, with similar patterns by sex and
race/ethnicity.
Conclusion. The MLSP confirms findings from
other registries on disparities by sex and race/ethnicity,
provides new estimates among Asians and Hispanics,
and provides estimates using the SLICC criteria.

 varying estimates of the incidence and prevalence of
SLE in the US (2) and the absence of available data for
certain demographic groups, we sought to obtain a fun-
damental epidemiologic understanding of SLE across
racial/ethnic groups. Under the auspices of the National
Arthritis Action Plan (3), the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (CDC) funded 4 state or city health
departments as well as the Indian Health Service (IHS)
to more robustly define the incidence and prevalence of
SLE. Results from the 2 initial sites, the Georgia Lupus
Registry (GLR) and the Michigan Lupus Epidemiology
and Surveillance (MILES) program, and the IHS site
have been recently published (4–6). However, their
estimates for Asians and Hispanics were limited. The
Manhattan Lupus Surveillance Program (MLSP) was
designed, along with the California Lupus Surveillance
Project (CLSP), to provide estimates of the incidence
and prevalence of SLE overall and specifically among
Hispanic and Asian populations.
We launched the MLSP in 2009 as a collabora-
tion between the New York City Department of Health
and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) and New York Univer-
sity School of Medicine (NYUSoM). Following methods
similar to those used at the other CDC-funded sites
(2,5,6), we designed the MLSP as a retrospective
descriptive project to identify all cases of diagnosed SLE
among residents of New York County (Manhattan),
New York, 2007–2009, to determine the prevalence and
incidence of SLE in this population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
The Manhattan Lupus Surveillance Program.
The
MLSP was designed to be similar to the GLR and MILES pro-
grams and, as described elsewhere (5,6), was conducted as a
public health surveillance project by the New York City
DOHMH, with NYUSoM acting as a public health agent on
behalf of the DOHMH. No patients were contacted for this
project. Medical records were collected under the health sur-
veillance exemption to the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability
Act
(HIPAA)
privacy
rules
(45
CFR
§
164.512[b]) and as authorized by New York City Charter Sec-
tions 556(c)(2) and (d)(2). The CDC deemed the MLSP to be
public health practice that did not require review by the CDC
Institutional Review Board (IRB). IRBs at both the New York
City DOHMH and NYUSoM reviewed and deemed the
MLSP to be a surveillance activity. Additional IRB applica-
tions were completed and submitted to independent case-
finding sources as requested.
Study population and study period. The MLSP sur-
veillance period was January 1, 2007 through December 31,
2009. New York County (Manhattan) was selected as the program
catchment area because of its racial/ethnic diversity and because it
is an island on which inhabitants largely remain for their health
care, thus making access to medical records easier. We used data
from lupus specialty clinics across New York City during initial
planning for the MLSP and found that few Manhattan residents
seek care in outer boroughs and that residents from other
boroughs were more likely to seek care across a wide geographic
range. Based on US Census data, there were 1,585,873 persons
residing in Manhattan in 2010 (48% non-Hispanic white, 13%
non-Hispanic black, 25% Hispanic, 11% non-Hispanic Asian)
(7).
Case definitions.
Our primary American College of
Rheumatology (ACR) case definition required $4 of the 11
criteria for the classification of SLE (8,9). Under the ACR
classification criteria, patients with evidence of lupus nephritis
(by biopsy report or specific documentation by a rheumatolo-
gist and/or nephrologist) are considered to have met the renal
criteria for SLE, even without information on the degree of
proteinuria or a description of the sediment. We also used
2 secondary case definitions of SLE: 1) the Systemic Lupus
Erythematosus Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) classification
criteria, which require the presence of at least 4 of 17 criteria,
at least 1 of which must be clinical and 1 immunologic, or
requires the presence of biopsy-proven lupus nephritis as well
as antinuclear antibodies or anti–double-stranded DNA anti-
bodies (10); or 2) the treating rheumatologist’s diagnosis of
SLE. The SLICC case definition was included as a recently
derived set of classification criteria with greater sensitivity and
less specificity than the ACR classification criteria (10). The
rheumatologist case definition was included because there is
no gold standard for diagnosing SLE, and diagnosis is usually
made by a physician who is familiar with the disease, often a
rheumatologist.
Initial
case-finding.
We
used
information
from
administrative databases, hospitals, and private rheumatolo-
gists to identify possible cases from as far back as 2004, when
records were available. Administrative databases included the
State of New York Department of Health Statewide Planning
and Research Cooperative System, with information on hospi-
talization discharges in New York State, and the New York
City DOHMH Vital Records, with information on all deaths
in New York City. We included only hospitals and private
rheumatologists based in Manhattan. We queried these
sources to identify records with International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis
codes indicating SLE (710.0), discoid lupus (695.4), or a
related condition that may evolve into SLE or might have
related symptoms (sicca syndrome [710.2], other specified
connective tissue disease [CTD] [710.8], unspecified CTD
[710.9]). If residence information was available from the case-
finding source, we further restricted these records to include
only those with evidence of Manhattan residence. Final
screening
of
records
was
completed
by
trained
MLSP
abstractors to confirm physician diagnosis or suspicion of SLE
or a related CTD and Manhattan residence during the surveil-
lance period.
Data collection. After initial case-finding, abstractors
collected and entered information from the medical records
into a New York City DOHMH database, with database and
data dictionary materials adapted from those used by the
GLR. When necessary, we corroborated Manhattan residence
using the LexisNexis online database service (11). Our
abstractors entered any ambiguous information into open text
notes, which were later reviewed with the NYUSoM principal
investigator (PMI) to correctly code it in the database.

2007
 All MLSP abstractors were trained under the GLR
model (5) before abstraction began and underwent routine
quality assurance reviews throughout the project. These
reviews provided the opportunity for abstractors and the
NYUSoM principal investigator to discuss any issues arising in
the field and to address questions from the abstractors. Each
abstractor had a medical degree and consistently achieved the
required minimum interobserver agreement of 90% on all ele-
ments and 95% on the ACR classification criteria, using as
the gold standard abstraction by the NYUSoM principal
investigator. The average performance of the abstractors dur-
ing training and reviews was 95.6% on all elements, 97.2% on

 the ACR classification criteria elements, and 97.5% on the
unique elements in the SLICC classification criteria that
were not already captured as part of the ACR classification
criteria.
Statistical analysis.
We defined prevalent cases as
new or existing cases meeting the ACR, SLICC, or rheumatol-
ogist case definition and residing in Manhattan at some time
from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007. We defined
incident cases as those meeting at least 1 of the case defini-
tions, having their first diagnosis from January 1, 2007 through
December 31, 2009, and residing in Manhattan. Population
denominators were taken from the New York City DOHMH–
interpolated intercensal population estimates for Manhattan
(12). We calculated rates overall, by sex, and by race/ethnicity
per 100,000 person-years and age-standardized to the 2000
standard population of the US using 10-year age categories for
each racial/ethnic group (13). Information on race was col-
lected separately from Hispanic ethnicity during abstraction.
For analysis, we assigned cases to 1 of 5 mutually exclusive
race/ethnicity categories: non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic Asian, and non-Hispanic other.
Non-Hispanic cases identified as .1 race were categorized as
non-Hispanic other.
We conducted capture–recapture analyses (14,15) to
estimate case underascertainment from our primary ACR case
definition. We fit log-linear models separately for incident and
prevalent cases by sex and race/ethnicity to estimate the num-
ber of cases missed in our catchment area. Specifically, we fit
various models that addressed potential violation of the homo-
geneity assumption of capture probability and identified the
best fitting model using the Akaike information criterion. We
then used estimates from these models to calculate revised
prevalence and incidence rates.
Chi-square tests, or Fisher’s exact tests when needed,
were used to assess univariate differences in SLE and ACR
manifestations by race/ethnicity and sex. We compared differ-
ences between estimates by case definition using 95% confi-
dence intervals (95% CIs) of the age-standardized rates,
with non-overlapping 95% CIs considered to be significantly
different. All analyses were completed using SAS version 9.3
(SAS Institute) and R version 3.3.0 (R Foundation for Statisti-
cal Computing) software.
RESULTS
Case-finding results. Case-finding and abstrac-
tion were completed in 19 of 21 hospitals (90.5%)
(Figure 1), with 2 hospitals declining to participate
(a cancer specialty hospital and a Veterans Affairs hos-
pital). Case-finding and abstraction were performed
from records of 94 of 124 private rheumatologists identi-
fied in the catchment area (75.8%). Of the 30 rheuma-
tologists who did not participate, 19 did not respond to
repeated requests or declined to participate, 2 died, 2
had retired and relocated, and 7 agreed to participate
but abstraction could not be arranged despite repeated
attempts before the data abstraction period ended.
Initial lists provided from the various case-
finding sources identified 76,220 records (Figure 1). We
removed duplicate records and records that did not
have a Manhattan address, resulting in 5,065 possible
cases with records for abstraction. During abstraction
and data cleaning, we deemed 1,184 cases ineligible due
to miscoded diagnosis or non-Manhattan residence. Of
the remaining 3,881 possible cases, 1,854 met at least 1
of the case definitions.
Primary ACR case definition of prevalence. In
2007, a total of 1,078 cases (307 non-Hispanic white, 282
non-Hispanic black, 344 Hispanic, 111 non-Hispanic
Asian, and 34 non-Hispanic other race/ethnicity) ful-
filled the ACR case definition for SLE (Table 1). The
overall crude and age-standardized prevalence rates
were 68.2 (95% CI 64.1–72.2) and 62.2 (95% CI 58.4–
66.0) per 100,000 person-years. Age-standardized rates
were ;9 times higher for women compared with men
(107.4 versus 12.5).
Age-standardized rates also differed by race/
ethnicity among both women and men. The highest
age-standardized prevalence rate was seen among
non-Hispanic black women (210.9 per 100,000 person-
years) followed by Hispanic women (138.3), non-
Hispanic
Asian
women
(91.2),
and
non-Hispanic
white women (64.3). The age-standardized prevalence
among men followed a similar pattern, with the highest
estimate among non-Hispanic blacks (26.7) followed
by Hispanics (19.4), non-Hispanic Asians (14.2), and
non-Hispanic whites (3.7).
Capture–recapture estimates showed an addi-
tional 122 cases of SLE, indicating that 10.2% of cases
may have been missed. Almost two-thirds (62.5%) of
the estimated cases missed were non-Hispanic white
women. With capture–recapture adjustment, the preva-
lence rate increased to 75.9 per 100,000 person-years
(95% CI 70.6–81.2).
The mean 6 SD age of women and men with SLE
living in Manhattan in 2007 was 43.3 6 15.5 years and
40.7 6 16.9 years, respectively. The average age by race/
ethnicity was 47.0 6 16.5 years among non-Hispanic
whites, 41.5 6 13.7 years among non-Hispanic blacks,
42.9 6 15.6 years among Hispanics, and 37.3 615.4 years
among non-Hispanic Asians. Figure 2A shows the
age-specific prevalence for women by race/ethnicity.
Prevalence was higher among non-Hispanic black
and Hispanic women ages 20–59 years as compared to
non-Hispanic white women of the same age group.
Prevalence among non-Hispanic Asian women was not
significantly different from that among non-Hispanic
white women for any age group. Numbers among men
were too small to assess age-specific rates by race/
ethnicity.

* Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cases were defined according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (met $4 of the 11 classification criteria), the Sys-
temic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria (met at least 4 of 17 criteria, at least 1 of which must be clinical and 1 immunologic, or the presence of biopsy-
proven lupus nephritis as well as antinuclear antibodies or anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies), or the treating rheumatologist’s diagnosis. Rates are per 100,000 person-years

 Among the 344 Hispanic cases, 82.6% were also
identified as white, 11.0% as black, and 6.4% as other
race/ethnicity. Information on Hispanic ethnicity was
often absent, with 239 (69.5%) having no further details,
but Hispanic case ethnicities included Central or South
American, Cuban, Dominican, Mexican, Puerto Rican,
and Spanish. There were 111 non-Hispanic Asian cases
as well as 5 identified as non-Hispanic other due to mul-
tiple race/ethnicity but with evidence of Asian race.
More than one-fourth (26.7%) of these cases had no
further classification for Asian ethnicity, but ethnicities
among cases with information available included Chi-
nese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Indian or Pakistani, Japanese,
Korean, Pacific Islander not otherwise specified, South
Asian, and Vietnamese.
Table 2 shows the occurrence of the 11 ACR cri-
teria overall and by race/ethnicity among prevalent
ACR cases. Renal disease was more common among
non-Hispanic
Asians
(53.2%),
non-Hispanic
blacks
(50.7%), and Hispanics (49.4%) compared with non-
Hispanic whites (25.4%). Neurologic manifestations
were more common among Hispanics (26.2%) and non-
Hispanic blacks (24.5%) compared with non-Hispanic
whites (16.6%). Also compared with non-Hispanic
whites, discoid lesions were more commonly seen
among non-Hispanic blacks (25.9% versus 8.8%) and
malar rash was more commonly seen among Hispanics
(50.0% versus 35.8%).

incidence
rates. From 2007 to 2009, a total of 232 incident cases
met the ACR case definition (Table 3) for SLE (92 non-
Hispanic white, 62 non-Hispanic black, 49 Hispanic,
22 non-Hispanic Asian, and 7 non-Hispanic other race/
ethnicity). The overall crude and age-standardized inci-
dence rates were 4.9 (95% CI 4.3–5.5) and 4.6 (95% CI
4.0–5.2) per 100,000 person-years, respectively. Age-
standardized rates differed by sex and were almost 8
times higher in women than in men (7.9 versus 1.0).
Age-standardized rates also differed by race/ethnicity
among
both
women
and
men.
The
highest
age-
standardized incidence rates among women were among
non-Hispanic blacks (15.7) followed by non-Hispanic
Asians (6.6), Hispanics (6.5), and non-Hispanic whites
(6.5). Similarly, the highest age-standardized incidence
rates among men were among non-Hispanic blacks (2.4)
followed by Hispanics (1.3), non-Hispanic Asians (0.5),
and non-Hispanic whites (0.5).
Capture–recapture
adjustment
estimated
284
incident cases of SLE, indicating that 18.4% of cases
were missed; 67.0% of these were non-Hispanic white
women. The resulting capture–recapture adjusted inci-
dence rate increased to 6.0 per 100,000 person-years
(95% CI 4.6–7.4).
The mean6 SD age at diagnosis was 40.1 6 16.6
years among women and 42.9 6 20.4 years among men,
with values of 42.2 6 17.7 years among non-Hispanic
whites, 39.2 6 16.3 years among non-Hispanic blacks,
39.6 6 17.0 years among Hispanics, and 37.9 6 16.0 years
among non-Hispanic Asians. Figure 2B shows the age-
specific incidence rates for women by race/ethnicity. The
only age-specific difference was between non-Hispanic
black and non-Hispanic white women who were 20–39
years old. Otherwise, due to small numbers within each
stratum, no age-specific differences were found.
Among the 49 incident Hispanic cases, 77.6%
were also identified as non-Hispanic white, 16.3% as
non-Hispanic black, and 6.1% as non-Hispanic other
race/ethnicity. As with the prevalent cases, Hispanic eth-
nicity information for incident cases was often absent,
with 71.4% having no further ethnicity information
available. Among the 22 incident non-Hispanic Asian
cases, 32% had no further data available.

* Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cases were defined according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (met $4 of the 11 classification criteria), the Sys-
temic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria (met at least 4 of 17 criteria, at least 1 of which must be clinical and 1 immunologic, or the presence of biopsy-
proven lupus nephritis as well as antinuclear antibodies or anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies), or the treating rheumatologist’s diagnosis. Rates are per 100,000 person-years
as a New York County (Manhattan) resident. Denominator data are based on 2007–2009 intercensal population estimates from the New York City Department of Health and
Mental Hygiene Bureau of Epidemiology Services (2000–2014 files). Data are standardized for age and race/ethnicity to the US standard population, 2000. Cases were assigned
to 1 of 5 mutually exclusive race/ethnicity categories: non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic Asian, and non-Hispanic other. Non-Hispanic cases identi-
fied as being of .1 race were categorized as non-Hispanic other.

 Table 2 shows the occurrence of the 11 ACR
criteria overall and by race/ethnicity among incident
ACR cases. Evidence of renal disease was found among
34.9% of incident cases, but was more common among
non-Hispanic
Asians
(45.5%),
non-Hispanic
blacks
(43.5%), and Hispanics (42.9%) compared with non-
Hispanic whites (23.9%). Discoid lesions were more
common among non-Hispanic blacks (25.8%) compared
with non-Hispanic whites (9.8%).
Secondary
case
definitions.
Prevalence and
incidence rates calculated using the SLICC case defini-
tion for SLE were significantly higher than those calcu-
lated using the primary ACR case definition. Using
the SLICC case definition generated crude and age-
standardized prevalence rates of 80.1 (95% CI 75.7–
84.5) and 73.8 (95% CI 69.6–77.9) per 100,000 person-
years, respectively, which were 17–19% higher than
those calculated using the ACR case definition. The
SLICC crude and age-standardized incidence rates (6.6
[95% CI 5.8–7.3] and 6.2 [95% CI 5.5–6.9], respectively)
were nearly 35% higher than the ACR incidence rates.
The rheumatologist case definition yielded crude
and age-standardized prevalence rates that were ;17%
higher than the ACR case definition rates (79.4 [95%
CI 75.0–83.8] and 72.6 [95% CI 68.5–76.7] per 100,000
person-years, respectively). Crude and age-standardized
incidence rates using the rheumatologist case definition
were similar to rates using the ACR case definition (5.3
[95% CI 4.7–6.0] and 5.0 [95% CI 4.4–5.7], respec-
tively). For both secondary case definitions, differences
in rates by sex and race/ethnicity were similar to those
identified by the ACR case definition.
Of the 1,538 incident and prevalent cases meeting
either the ACR or SLICC case definition, 75.6% met
both ACR and SLICC definitions, 4.3% met only the
ACR definition, and 20.2% met only the SLICC defini-
tion. Table 4 displays information on the unique SLICC
criteria that are not part of the ACR classification criteria
among incident and prevalent cases meeting the SLICC
case definition only. The most common unique SLICC
criteria among these cases were low complement levels,
alopecia, and different definitions for lymphopenia. In
addition, 5.5% of cases meeting the SLICC case defini-
tion had ANA or anti–double-stranded DNA antibody
and biopsy findings consistent with lupus nephritis.
Reasons that cases met the ACR and not the SLICC
case definition were largely due to having $4 clinical cri-
teria but no immunologic criteria, differences in categori-
zation of photosensitivity and malar rash (which were
separate in the ACR criteria and combined in the SLICC
criteria), and differences in defining lymphopenia and
anticardiolipin antibody (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
Our analysis of the MLSP data provides preva-
lence and incidence rate estimates of SLE among Man-
hattan residents using methods similar to other CDC-
funded SLE registries. Our analysis confirms evidence
of a higher prevalence of SLE among non-Hispanic
blacks compared with non-Hispanic whites and adds
evidence of a higher prevalence of SLE among His-
panics and non-Hispanic Asians. The MLSP is the first
among the CDC-funded SLE registries to report using
the SLICC classification criteria, which were recently
validated (10), to describe cases of SLE.
The age-standardized prevalence and incidence
rates of SLE in Manhattan were 62.2 (95% CI 58.4–

anti–b2-glycoprotein I and anticardiolipin antibodies were not col-
lected. For anti–double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) determined by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the results were reported as
positive or negative; thus, it is possible that in some cases, this criterion
was overcounted in the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating
Clinics (SLICC) system if the positive result was not specifically double
the upper cutoff for the negative value. Finally, CH50 was not cap-
tured, and thus, it is possible that the SLICC criterion for complement
was undercounted. ACR 5 American College of Rheumatology; ANA-

 66.0) and 4.6 (95% CI 4.0–5.2) per 100,000 person-years
using the ACR case definition. Compared with previous
reports by the CDC-funded sites, we estimated slightly
lower overall age-standardized prevalence than did the
GLR (73.0 [95% CI 68.9–77.4]) (5) and MILES (72.8
[95% CI 70.8–74.8]) studies (6), but we found similar
disparities by sex and race/ethnicity for non-Hispanic
whites and non-Hispanic blacks. The MLSP prevalence
estimates increased with capture–recapture adjustment
(75.9 [95% CI 70.6–81.2]) and were comparable to the
capture–recapture–adjusted estimates from the GLR
(83.0 [95% CI 78.6–87.7]). Our age-standardized inci-
dence rates using the ACR case definition were similar
to those from the GLR and MILES.
We found the highest prevalence and incidence
rates among non-Hispanic blacks, consistent with the
GLR and MILES studies and with preliminary data
from the CLSP study. However, unlike the GLR and
MILES studies, we found elevated prevalence among
non-Hispanic Asians and Hispanics compared with non-
Hispanic whites. Compared with preliminary crude esti-
mates from the CLSP study (16), the MLSP showed
similar elevated rates among Hispanics (84.2 [95% CI
75.3–93.1] versus 87.7 [95% CI 72.1–106.8] per 100,000
person-years) but slightly lower rates among non-
Hispanic Asians (64.0 [95% CI 52.1–75.9] versus 95.8
[95% CI 84.9–108.1] per 100,000 person-years). These
MLSP findings are particularly important, given the few
published studies on the prevalence and incidence of
SLE among Asians and Hispanics in the US. A review
published in 1973 presented estimates among New
York City residents from 1956 to 1965 but focused only
on whites, blacks, and Puerto Ricans (17). Another
study published in 2001 estimated the prevalence of
SLE among Hispanics in Arizona to be 103.0 per
100,000 persons, slightly higher than the rate found by
the MLSP among Hispanics in Manhattan (18). A more
recent study using Medicaid data estimated an even
higher prevalence of SLE among Hispanics (126.5 per
100,000 persons) with Medicaid coverage in the US
from 2000 to 2004 (19).
The study using Medicaid data is one of the few
to estimate rates of SLE among Asians in the US, report-
ing a prevalence ;3 times that estimated by the MLSP
(175.1 versus 56.2 per 100,000 persons) (19). The only
other studies known to assess rates of SLE among Asians
in the US focused on SLE prevalence. One study identi-
fied cases in Hawaii based on physician diagnosis at 5
medical centers and outpatient practices in 1989. The
overall SLE prevalence identified in that study (41.8 per
100,000 persons) was similar to the MLSP estimate for
non-Hispanic Asians, and the age-standardized rates for
women of specific Asian ethnic groups (Chinese, Fili-
pino, Hawaiian, Japanese) was found to be higher com-
pared with that among white women (20). Another study,
using hospital discharge data, reported that Asian/Pacific
Islander women had a lower rate of prevalent SLE com-
pared with white women (21). Less is known about the
incidence of SLE among Asians. In England, new diag-
noses
of
SLE
are
more
common
among
Asians,
specifically South Asians from India and Pakistan, com-
pared with whites (22,23), but to our knowledge, there
are no other published reports on the incidence of SLE
among Asians in the US.
In this analysis, we also provide information on
manifestations among SLE cases. Clinical or serologic
manifestations among prevalent cases approximated
those from the GLR and MILES registries. The MLSP
found a high burden of nephritis overall, with nearly
half (42.4%) of prevalent cases developing nephritis.
The proportion of those with nephritis was higher
among non-white prevalent cases, specifically 50.7%
among non-Hispanic blacks, 49.4% among Hispanics,
and 53.2% among non-Hispanic Asians as compared
with 25.4% among non-Hispanic whites, results that are
consistent with those of other studies (5,6,19,24,25).
The SLICC case definition of SLE yielded higher
incidence and prevalence estimates than the ACR case
definition. Unique criteria which substantiated the classi-
fication of SLE based on SLICC, but not ACR, criteria
included low complement levels, alopecia, and different
definitions of lymphopenia (10). The small number of
cases that met the ACR but not the SLICC case defini-
tion is reassuring, as it suggests that few cases met ACR
criteria for SLE without the presence of autoantibodies.
However, given the descriptive nature of the MLSP and
the absence of a gold standard test that would unambigu-
ously identify SLE, this project could not assess which set
of classification criteria is more sensitive or specific. In
addition, non-overlapping confidence intervals were used
to conservatively assess differences among rates (26).
There were several limitations to this project.
First, we may have underestimated cases, as 2 hospitals
and one-fourth of rheumatologists in the catchment
area declined to participate. Most of the practices
that did not participate were in neighborhoods with a
majority white population, which is consistent with our
capture–recapture analysis that estimated 67.3% of
prevalent cases and 70.0% of incident cases missed were
non-Hispanic white. However, the exclusion of the
Veterans Affairs hospital may have resulted in under-
identification of men diagnosed as having SLE. We also
did not include nephrology, dermatology, or primary or
alternative
care
practices
among
our
case-finding

 sources. Though when possible we did query hospital
pathology databases for relevant kidney or skin biopsies,
we still may have missed milder cases that were not hos-
pitalized or seen by a rheumatologist during the surveil-
lance period. It is also possible that we missed cases if
they lived in Manhattan but sought care in other bor-
oughs or a neighboring state.
Second, medical systems differed tremendously,
and any difficulty navigating different electronic medical
records or any difficulty with the legibility of paper
records could have led to missed or miscoded data.
Additionally, medical records are designed for physician
use, not for data abstraction and surveillance. Thus,
some information of interest may have been missing or
ambiguous, depending on what was collected and re-
corded by the case-finding source.
Third, abstracting occurred several years after
the surveillance period, which could have led to missing
information if records were put into storage or if data
elements were lost during a facility’s migration from
paper to electronic records. This lag time may have also
affected our ability to find cases of SLE, as some newer
systems were unable to query past certain dates. Addi-
tionally, many private practices did not retain informa-
tion on patients’ prior addresses, so we may not have
abstracted cases who moved outside of Manhattan since
the surveillance period. However, when possible, the
software LexisNexis was used to verify patient residence
within the catchment area.
Finally, data on race and ethnicity was abstracted
from administrative and medical records, which may not
accurately represent the patient’s own racial or ethnic
identification. Additionally, information on ethnicity
was often missing or did not include detail such as coun-
try of origin, which limited our ability to describe rates
of SLE among specific ethnic groups. Though available
information did reflect the major ethnic groups in Man-
hattan, ethnicity information was missing for most His-
panic cases and more than one-fourth of non-Hispanic
Asian cases. Categorized broadly, Hispanic or Asian
race encompasses a number of heterogeneous groups
and SLE rates among them may differ. Given the
already limited number of published studies on SLE
among Asians and Hispanics, additional work is needed
to better describe and understand the experience of
SLE among specific ethnic subpopulations.
Despite these limitations, our analysis benefitted
from the design and composition of the MLSP. First,
the MLSP was designed as a population-based registry
with methods similar to those used for 4 other CDC-
funded SLE registries, which allowed us to compare
rates across sites. Second, the diverse population within
our catchment area allowed us to estimate rates of SLE
among the major racial categories, particularly Asians
and Hispanics. Third, given the recent publication of
the SLICC classification criteria, we were able to esti-
mate rates of SLE by this case definition and compare
them to the ACR case definition. Fourth, the partner-
ship with the New York City DOHMH allowed us to
collect information from a number of case-finding
sources and find complete clinical information on most
cases. Finally, our abstractors all had a medical back-
ground, which helped during training and provided an
advantage during extensive review of medical records to
identify SLE criteria.
In conclusion, we found substantial disparities in
prevalence, incidence, and manifestations of SLE by sex
and race/ethnicity among Manhattan residents. Women
consistently had higher prevalence and incidence rates
of SLE compared with men, and non-Hispanic blacks,
Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Asians had higher rates
of diagnosed SLE and a higher proportion had lupus
nephritis compared with non-Hispanic whites. The
highest rates of SLE were seen among non-Hispanic
black women, followed by Hispanic, non-Hispanic
Asian, and non-Hispanic white women. Using the
SLICC criteria for SLE provided higher prevalence and
incidence rates than the ACR criteria.
