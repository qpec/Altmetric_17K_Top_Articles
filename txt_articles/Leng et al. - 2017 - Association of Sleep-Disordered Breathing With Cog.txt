 Association of Sleep-Disordered Breathing With Cognitive
Function and Risk of Cognitive Impairment
A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
Yue Leng, PhD; Claire T. McEvoy, PhD; Isabel E. Allen, PhD; Kristine Yaffe, MD
IMPORTANCE Growing evidence suggests an association between sleep-disordered breathing
(SDB) and cognitive decline in elderly persons. However, results from population-based
studies have been conflicting, possibly owing to different methods to assess SDB or cognitive
domains, making it difficult to draw conclusions on this association.
OBJECTIVE To provide a quantitative synthesis of population-based studies on the
relationship between SDB and risk of cognitive impairment.
DATA SOURCES PubMed, EMBASE, and PsychINFO were systematically searched to identify
peer-reviewed articles published in English before January 2017 that reported on the
association between SDB and cognitive function.
STUDY SELECTION We included cross-sectional and prospective studies with at least 200
participants with a mean participant age of 40 years or older.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were extracted independently by 2 investigators. We
extracted and pooled adjusted risk ratios from prospective studies and standard mean
differences from cross-sectional studies, using random-effect models. This meta-analysis
followed the PRISMA guidelines and also adhered to the MOOSE guidelines.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cognitive outcomes were based on standard tests or
diagnosis of cognitive impairment. Sleep-disordered breathing was ascertained by
apnea-hypopnea index or clinical diagnosis.
RESULTS We included 14 studies, 6 of which were prospective, covering a total of 4 288 419
men and women. Pooled analysis of the 6 prospective studies indicated that those with SDB
were 26% (risk ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.50) more likely to develop cognitive impairment,
with no evidence of publication bias but significant heterogeneity between studies. After
removing 1 study that introduced significant heterogeneity, the pooled risk ratio was 1.35
(95% CI, 1.11-1.65). Pooled analysis of the 7 cross-sectional studies suggested that those with
SDB had slightly worse executive function (standard mean difference, −0.05; 95% CI, −0.09
to 0.00), with no evidence of heterogeneity or publication bias. Sleep-disordered breathing
was not associated with global cognition or memory.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Sleep-disordered breathing is associated with an increased
risk of cognitive impairment and a small worsening in executive function. Further studies are
required to determine the mechanisms linking these common conditions and whether
treatment of SDB might reduce risk of cognitive impairment.

 S
leep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a very common but
treatable condition in older adults. There has been grow-
ing interest in the relationship between SDB and ad-
verse health consequences, including hypertension, diabe-
tes, and cardiovascular diseases.1-4 While the association
between SDB and health outcomes remains controversial, es-
pecially in older populations,5-8 recent evidence has sug-
gested a link between SDB and cognitive decline in elderly
persons.9-11 Notably, most early studies have examined the as-
sociation between SDB and cognition in clinical populations,
eg, among patients at sleep clinics.12-14 These studies usually
consist of individuals with relatively severe SDB and were lim-
ited by small sample sizes and failure to account for confound-
ing factors.
Over the past few years, an increasing number of popula-
tion-based studies have been conducted on SDB and cogni-
tive impairment.15-17 These community-dwelling samples of-
ten include individuals with milder SDB, as opposed to those
examined in case-control studies. Some of these studies sug-
gested that SDB was associated with increased risk of demen-
tiaorimpairmentacrossdifferentcognitivedomains,18-20while
others found no association.17,21 Owing to different study de-
signs and methods to assess SDB, it is difficult to draw con-
clusions on the consistency of the associations. Moreover, be-
cause each study has reported on specific domains using
different scales, it is unclear if SDB has differential effects on
cognitive domains. Therefore, a meta-analytic approach is par-
ticularly useful for synthesizing these studies and elucidat-
ing pooled estimates for the effects of SDB on risk of cogni-
tive impairment as well as effects across different cognitive
domains. Given the high prevalence of cognitive impairment
in elderly persons and its significant consequences,22,23 it is
critical to explore the role of SDB as a modifiable risk factor.
Methods
Search Strategy and Study Selection
We searched for articles published before January 2017 using
electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and Psy-
chINFO, and hand searched the reference lists of identified ar-
ticles. Studies were identified using the search terms “(sleep-
disordered breathing OR sleep apnea OR obstructive sleep
apnea) AND (cognition OR cognitive function OR cognitive de-
cline OR dementia OR Alzheimer’
s OR cognitive impair-
ment).
” The search was restricted to articles published in Eng-
lish. Studies were included if they (1) were original articles
published in a peer-reviewed journal; (2) used a cross-
sectional or prospective cohort design; (3) were conducted in
population-based samples (N ≥ 200; mean age ≥40 years); (4)
defined SDB by apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) or clinical diag-
nosis by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-
sion (ICD-9) codes; (5) incorporated outcomes on Alzheimer
disease (AD), dementia risk, or cognitive impairment, as de-
fined by validated cognitive tests; (6) reported effect esti-
mates appropriate for the pooled analysis of effect sizes (eg,
odds ratios [ORs], hazard ratios, mean differences, or stan-
dardized mean differences [SMDs] in cognitive test scores) or
other types of estimates (eg, correlation or regression coeffi-
cient) that could be converted to the above forms; and (7) pre-
sented results adjusted for covariates (at least by age, sex, and
education). Studies were excluded if they (1) were case re-
ports, abstracts, reviews, or meta-analyses; (2) were con-
ducted in clinical populations; (3) used case-control design;
(4) used self-reported SDB; or (5) reported the prevalence of
SDB rather than studying SDB as a risk factor.
Data Extraction and Cognitive Outcomes
The eligibility of the studies to be included in the analysis was
determined and data were extracted independently by 2 in-
vestigators (Y.L. and C.T.M.). If multiple articles were pub-
lished from the same cohort reporting on the same cognitive
outcomes, we included only the one with the most complete
details; if multiple articles from the same cohort had differ-
ent study designs or if they reported on different cognitive out-
comes, we included each of these articles separately in the
analysis. Differences in data extraction between the extrac-
tors were resolved by consensus discussion and consultation
with a third investigator (K.Y.).
Because most prospective studies reported the OR or haz-
ard ratio for cognitive impairment,15,18,24-26 risk ratio esti-
mates were extracted from these studies. To quantify the as-
sociation between SDB and different cognitive domains, we
extracted the adjusted cognitive test scores from the cross-
sectional studies.17,27-30 We also obtained adjusted estimates
from Nikodemova et al31 and Hrubos-Strøm et al32 by contact-
ing the study authors. To be included in the pooled analysis,
a cognitive domain has to be represented by more than 3 stud-
ies; thus, we focused on 3 cognitive domains: global func-
tion, delayed memory (unless the study only assessed imme-
diatememory),andexecutivefunction.Thesedomainsarealso
particularly important in the context of aging and develop-
ment of AD. The cognitive tests included from each study are
summarized in Table 1 and Table 2.

Key Points
Question What are the effects of sleep-disordered breathing
(SDB) on cognitive function and risk of cognitive impairment?
Findings In this systematic review meta-analysis that included
more than 4 million participants, those with SDB were 26% more
likely to develop cognitive impairment than those without SDB.
They also had slightly worse performance in executive function
but not in global cognition or memory.
Meaning Sleep-disordered breathing may be an important
modifiable risk factor for dementia and other cognitive
impairment; future studies are needed to examine if treatment of
SDB might reduce risk of cognitive impairment.

 a 3% reduction (AHI3%), or an event-related arousal (AHI3a).
Because there was a mixed use of these definitions in the in-
cluded studies, we first presented narrative description of the
definitions, and for the main analysis, we pooled the estimates
by AHI less than 15 and 15 or greater to be consistent with the
most commonly used cutoff33 and to provide a most general-
izablecategorization.Forstudiesthathavefurtherbrokendown
these 2 categories,17,25,27-29,32 we calculated a weighted mean
for AHI less than 15 and 15 or greater. For other studies16,29,30
that did not provide sufficient information for analysis by this
cutoff, we contacted study authors or used other literature to
obtain necessary information for the calculation.
Statistical Analysis
We pooled risk ratios to summarize the prospective relation-
ship between SDB and cognitive impairment. One prospec-
tive study17 reported the changes in z scores of 3 cognitive tests
that were strongly associated with AD or vascular dementia;
we converted the mean z scores of these tests into a single risk
ratio using the online meta-analysis calculator (David B. Wil-
son, PhD; http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/escalc/html
/EffectSizeCalculator-OR5.php).
For cross-sectional studies, we calculated SMD in cogni-
tive test scores by SDB status. In cases where a higher score
indicatedworsecognition,wemultipliedthescoreby−1sothat
high scores indicated better performance across all tests. One
study34 only reported the OR, and this was converted to Co-
hen d using the formula SMD = log(OR) × �3 / π. For one
study29 where neither the SDs nor the 95% CIs were reported,
we used the SD of the same test from another previous study.21
ToestimatethepooledSMDforeachcognitivedomain,wefirst
calculated a summary Hedges g estimate for each domain from
each individual source study. This step ensures that multiple
relevant tests within each source study were all considered in
theanalysiswithoutbeingoverrepresentedinthepooledanaly-
sis. All effect estimates were then pooled using a weighted ran-
dom-effects model.
Wetestedbetween-studyheterogeneityusingI2statistics35
and used Egger test and funnel plot asymmetry to evaluate
publication bias.36 All tests were 2-tailed. Sensitivity analysis
was conducted by excluding the studies that introduced sig-
nificant heterogeneity to the analysis on each cognitive out-
come. The quality of the included studies was evaluated in-
dependently by 2 investigators (Y.L. and C.T.M.) using the
Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale.37 Our study ad-
heres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Re-
views and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines38 and the Meta-
analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE)

iesusedclinicallydiagnosedSDB,24,26,34whiletherestpresent-
edresultsbyAHIcutoffs15,17,18,21,25,27-32orbycontinuousscores.16
Four studies17,29,31,32 used AHI4% for the definition of SDB, 6
studies15,16,18,25,27,30 used AHI3%, and 1 study28 did not specify
the definition of AHI.
Prospective Studies of SDB and
Risk of Cognitive Impairment
Pooled analysis of the 6 prospective studies (including 212 943
participants) indicated that those with SDB were 26% (risk ra-
tio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.50) more likely to develop cognitive
impairment, defined by clinically relevant cognitive
decline15,17,25 or risk of dementia,18,24,26 with no evidence of
publication bias but significant between-study heteroge-
neity (Figure 1). The 3 prospective studies that showed posi-
tive findings all examined risk of mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) or dementia as the outcome,18,24,26 and 2 of these used
ICD-9 codes to define SDB.24,26 Sensitivity analysis shows that
after removing the study by Blackwell et al15 from this pooled
analysis, the heterogeneity disappeared (risk ratio, 1.35; 95%
CI, 1.11-1.65).
Cross-sectional Studies
Global Cognition
Pooled analysis of 6 cross-sectional studies (including
4 073 604 participants) suggested that SDB was not signifi-
cantly associated with global cognition (SMD, −0.02; 95% CI,
−0.07 to 0.04) (Figure 2A). There was no evidence of publi-
cation bias but significant heterogeneity between studies. Af-
ter removing the study by Sharafkhaneh et al,34 the heteroge-
neity disappeared (SMD, 0.01; 95% CI, −0.04 to 0.05).
Executive Function
Pooled analysis of 7 cross-sectional studies (including 15 220
participants) indicated that those with SDB had worse execu-
tive function compared with those without (SMD, −0.05; 95%
CI,−0.09to0.00)(Figure2B).Therewasnoevidenceofhetero-
geneity or publication bias.
Memory
Figure 2C shows the relationship between SDB and memory.
One study only examined immediate memory,32 while the rest
assessed delayed recall.16,17,28,31 Pooled analysis of 5 cross-
sectional studies (including 11 863 participants) indicated an
SMD of −0.01 (95% CI, −0.05 to 0.04) in memory score be-
tween those with and without SDB. There was no evidence of
heterogeneity or publication bias.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide a compre-
hensive systematic review and quantitative synthesis of popu-
lation-based studies on SDB and cognitive function and to ob-
tain pooled estimates of the effects of SDB on both the risk of
cognitive impairment and on different domains of cognitive
function. Our pooled analysis of more than 4 million adults
showed that those with SDB were 26% (risk ratio, 1.26; 95%
CI, 1.05-1.50) more likely to develop cognitive impairment and
had slightly worse performance in executive function but not
on global cognition or memory. Although some between-
study heterogeneity was found, sensitivity analysis con-
firmed these associations, and there was no evidence of pub-
lication bias.
Our findings provide evidence that SDB may be an impor-
tant modifiable risk factor for cognitive impairment in el-
derly persons. Notably, a 2017 study40 suggested that SDB
might lead to early but possibly modifiable AD biomarker
changes. Our results are also supported by a 2016 meta-
analysis of case-control studies,41 which suggested that pa-
tients with AD were 5-fold more likely to have SDB compared
with cognitively intact individuals of similar age. In our meta-
analysis,the3prospectivestudies18,24,26thatexaminedtherisk

 of MCI or dementia as the outcomes showed significant asso-
ciations while the other 3 studies15,17,25 that did not find any
association all defined cognitive impairment as a significant
cognitive decline. This could be owing to the differences in
these cognitive outcomes, given that the severity of cognitive
impairment indicated by even a significant decline in cogni-
tive scores might not be comparable with that of clinically di-
agnosed MCI or dementia. It is also possible that SDB might
be particularly important through the course of conversion to
MCI or dementia. However, to our knowledge, the underly-
ing cause of this observation has yet to be determined. Fur-
thermore, studies that found significant results mostly used
clinicaldiagnosisofSDBratherthananAHIof15orgreater.24,26
This could be because the more severe cases are more likely
to be detected and less likely to be misclassified or because
there exist mechanistic pathways through which severe
SDB could particularly impair cognition. Sensitivity analysis
showed similar results after removing the study15 that intro-
duced significant heterogeneity to the pooled analysis of pro-
spective studies. This heterogeneity might be because of spe-
cific characteristics of the study sample (all older men)15 or
relatively short follow-up length compared with other simi-
lar studies.17,25
Thepooledanalysisofcross-sectionalstudiessuggeststhat
there was a modest association between SDB and worse ex-
ecutive function but not with global cognition or memory. This
is in line with 2 previous meta-analyses of clinical studies,42,43
which indicated an effect of SDB on executive function, vigi-
lance,andpsychomotorspeed,whilemixedfindingshavebeen
reported on the effects of SDB on memory.42-44 Notably, the
included studies used cognitive tests that varied in the diffi-
cultyofadministration.Moreover,notallstudiesexaminedthe
same cognitive domains, and even those that studied similar
domains might have used different measures of that domain.
This is particularly an issue for executive function, where cer-
tain components might be more vulnerable to the negative ef-
fects of SDB. Therefore, these findings should be interpreted
with caution.
Several mechanisms have been proposed for the associa-
tion between SDB and neurocognitive decline, including hy-

 poxemia, daytime sleepiness, sleep fragmentation, and oxida-
tive stress.45,46 To date, it remains controversial which is the
most likely mechanism, especially in the absence of well-
designed interventional studies to help disentangle the causal
pathways.Notably,therehasbeengrowingattentionontheim-
portant role that hypoxemia might play in the relationship be-
tween SDB and cognition.18,45-47 Findings from the Hypno-
Lausstudy,20theSleepHeartHealthStudy,48theApneaPositive

Regular intermittent hypoxia may cause vascular dysfunction,

term disruption of the brain’
s microenvironment and synaptic
plasticity.10,50 A few studies have suggested that measures of
oxygen desaturation are associated with cognitive
impairment.15,18,27,30 Because measures of oxygen desatura-
tion were only reported in 2 studies included in this meta-
analysis,wecouldnotcalculatepooledestimatesforthesemea-
sures. Future studies with consideration of different indices of
SDB might provide more insights into the mechanisms.
Two included studies indicated that the effects of SDB on
cognition were more pronounced in APOE4 carriers.30,31 While
the exact mechanisms for the interaction between SDB and
APOE4 on cognition are unclear, the presence of APOE4 geno-
type is believed to increase cellular vulnerability to oxidative
damageandpromoteneuroinflammation.51,52Morestudiesare
needed to investigate the combined effects of APOE4 and SDB
on cognition and to help understand potential mechanisms of
their interaction.
Limitations
A few factors limit the interpretation of our results. First, the
limited amount of empirical data that is appropriate for inclu-
sion in the meta-analysis has led to a few problems. For ex-
ample, prospective studies that examined “clinically signifi-
cant” cognitive decline and MCI or dementia were analyzed
in the same model, despite the differences between these out-
comes. However, sensitivity analysis showed similar results
after removing the heterogeneity from the analysis. We fo-
cusedonsummarizingcross-sectionalevidenceon3broadcog-
nitive domains owing to a limited number of studies that ex-
amined detailed components of the cognitive domain and the
variations in the cognitive tests administered. Although some
evidence was found on the relationship between SDB and ex-
ecutive function, the clinical relevance of these findings is un-
clear, given the modest effect sizes. Future studies should use
comprehensiveneuropsychologicaltestbatteries,andagreater
number of studies is needed to examine the effects of SDB on
specific cognitive abilities more carefully. The scarce informa-
tion from existing studies has also limited our ability to per-
form subgroup analysis, eg, by age. Given the potential differ-
ences in SDB phenotypes among younger vs older
populations,5,53,54 our analysis on the mixture of middle-
aged and older populations might have led to underestima-
tion of the overall association, and we were unable to differ-
entiate the cognitive effects of SDB in different age groups.
Besides, to control for confounding, we included only the most
adjusted model within each study. However, the level of ad-
justment in each study was different, and many studies have
failed to consider potentially important confounders, such as
body mass index. Therefore, residual confounding remains a
possibility. Finally, we used a clinical diagnosis or an AHI of
15 or greater to define SDB in the pooled analysis, as this is the
cutoff used by most previous studies.33 This could have intro-
duced misclassification that dilutes the association, espe-
cially given that the 3 different methods of scoring hypop-
neas could yield significantly different AHI values.55 Because
there were not enough studies for meta-analysis if we were to
perform the analysis separately for AHI3%, AHI3a, and AHI4%,
wechosetouse1cutoffintheanalysisbuthavepresentedthese
methods narratively. This approach has also limited our abil-
ity to examine the association between the severity of SDB and
cognitive outcomes. It is possible that while no association was
found between certain cognitive domains and the dichoto-
mized AHI, more severe SDB or other indicators of hypox-
emia might be associated with significantly worse cognition.
Futureepidemiologicstudiesshouldconsidercontinuousmea-
suresofAHItominimizethepossibilityofmisclassificationand
to reveal more information about the severity of SDB.
Conclusions
In summary, this meta-analysis of population-based studies
suggests that individuals with SDB are 26% more likely to de-
velop cognitive impairment. Given the high prevalence of both
cognitive impairment and SDB, these findings could have sig-
nificant clinical implications. Identification of SDB in elderly
persons might help to predict future risk of cognitive impair-
ment. Clinicians should closely follow patients who experi-
ence significant levels of SDB for the occurrence of cognitive
dysfunction and might consider administering full neuropsy-
chological batteries in some instances. This is potentially im-
portant for the early detection of dementia. Future studies are
required to examine whether treatment of SDB could benefit
cognition and to explore underlying mechanisms. Ulti-
mately, this might open up new opportunities for the preven-
tion of cognitive decline and dementia in elderly persons.
