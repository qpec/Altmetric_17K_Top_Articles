Background.
Although antenatal influenza vaccination is an important public health intervention for preventing serious infec-
tion in pregnant women and newborns, reported vaccine coverage is often <50%. Concern for the safety to the fetus is a commonly
cited reason for vaccine hesitancy and refusal. The incidence of stillbirth following pandemic vaccination has been previously studied;
however, no population-based study has evaluated the incidence of stillbirth following seasonal trivalent influenza vaccination.
Methods.
We used probabilistic linking of perinatal and maternal vaccination records to establish a cohort of 58 008 births oc-
curring between April 2012 and December 2013. Stillbirth was defined as birth ≥20 weeks’ gestation with an Apgar score of zero at 1
and 5 minutes following delivery. Cox regression models adjusted for maternal smoking, Indigenous status, and propensity for vac-
cination were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) in vaccinated and unvaccinated mothers.
Results.
A total of 5076 (8.8%) pregnant women received trivalent influenza vaccine and 377 stillbirths occurred. There were 5.0
and 3.0 stillbirths per 100 000 pregnancy-days among unvaccinated and vaccinated women, respectively. After adjustment, stillbirth
was 51% less likely among vaccinated vs unvaccinated mothers (aHR, 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], .29–.84). The largest relative
reduction in stillbirths was observed for births occurring just after influenza season (aHR, 0.33; 95% CI, .12–.88).
Conclusions.
Mothers who received seasonal TIV during pregnancy were significantly less likely to experience stillbirth com-
pared with unvaccinated mothers. These results support the safety of seasonal influenza immunization during pregnancy and suggest
a protective effect.

Pregnant women are at increased risk of serious complications
following influenza infection, including pneumonia and acute
respiratory distress syndrome [1–3]. This increased risk is
thought to be the result of depressed cell-mediated immunity
and physiological changes to the cardiopulmonary system asso-
ciated with pregnancy [1, 3]. Influenza infection during preg-
nancy has also been linked to adverse fetal and neonatal
outcomes, including increased risk of preterm birth [1, 4, 5]
and fetal mortality; this effect has been most pronounced dur-
ing influenza pandemics [1,6].During the recent 2009 influenza
A(H1N1) pandemic, a significant increase in perinatal mortal-
ity was observed following maternal infection, most of this at-
tributable to a 4-fold increase in stillbirths [6, 7].
Seasonal influenza vaccination has been shown to prevent in-
fection in mothers and their newborn infants [8, 9], and the
World Health Organization has indicated that pregnant women
should receive the highest priority for seasonal influenza vacci-
nation [10].Reported vaccine uptake remains <50% in pregnant
women, and concern regarding the safety of the vaccine for the
fetus is a commonly cited reason why women refuse vaccination
[11, 12]. Enhanced data collection and surveillance during the
2009 H1N1 pandemic offered the unique opportunity to mon-
itor the safety of pandemic influenza vaccination in large, obser-
vational studies [13]. These studies suggested stillbirth was less
common in women who received pandemic vaccine compared
with unvaccinated women, supporting the safety of pandemic
influenza vaccination during pregnancy [6, 13–16]; however,
to date, no population-based study has been conducted to eval-
uate the impact of antenatal administration of seasonal influen-
za vaccination on stillbirth during nonpandemic influenza
seasons [13, 16]. The aim of this study was to assess the relative
risk of stillbirth among vaccinated and unvaccinated pregnant
women during the 2012 and 2013 seasonal influenza epidemics
in the winter months of the southern hemisphere.

 approximately 30 000 births each year. For this analysis,
multiple statewide data sources were linked by the Western
Australian Data Linkage Branch of the Western Australia De-
partment of Health, using probabilistic matching of the full
name and date of birth of mothers who delivered in Western
Australia between 1 April 2012 and 31 December 2013. The
project was approved by the Western Australia Department of
Health Human Research Ethics Committee.
Data Sources
Vaccination Status
Seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) has been provided at
no cost under the National Immunisation Program to pregnant
women since 2009 and has been part of routine antenatal care
in Western Australia since 2012. Postpartum surveys estimate
that 25%–36% of women who were pregnant during the study
period received seasonal TIV [17]. The majority of pregnant
women in Australia receive their influenza vaccine from general
practitioners; an additional 19% are immunized at public hos-
pital antenatal clinics [17]. As part of ongoing vaccine safety
surveillance, providers administering influenza vaccine during
pregnancy under the National Immunisation Program are
asked to inform the Western Australia Department of Health
of the name, date of birth, and vaccination date of the expectant
mother. This information is stored in the Western Australia An-
tenatal Influenza Vaccination Database. In our cohort, women
with a vaccination record in the database with a date of influen-
za vaccination occurring between the estimated date of concep-
tion (based on gestation) and 14 days prior to date of delivery
were defined as vaccinated during pregnancy.
Birth Information
The Midwives Notification System is a legally mandated data
collection system that requires the healthcare professional at-
tending the birth to provide information at the time of delivery
related to the pregnancy for all births in Western Australia ≥20
weeks’ gestation [18]. The midwife in attendance usually sub-
mits birth information to the system; however, in the absence
of a midwife the medical officer is asked to submit the informa-
tion. If there is no midwife or medical officer in attendance, the
first qualified midwife or medical offer to attend would submit
the information. In Western Australia, 98% of births occur in
hospital (59% of which are public), and 1% occur at a birth cen-
ter, all of which are staffed by midwives [18].The remaining 1%
of births occur at home, which may or may not be attended by a
midwife. The Midwives Notification System is thought to in-
clude 99% of births in the state [19]. Midwives Notification Sys-
tem data include the date of birth, birth weight, postcode of
residence, status of the baby at birth (alive or dead), Apgar
scores at 1 minute and 5 minutes after delivery, medical condi-
tions of the mother, and complications related to the pregnancy
and delivery. Gestation provided in Midwives Notification
System data is estimated based on a previously validated algo-
rithm drawing from both antenatal indicators (eg, expected due
date) and neonatal indicators of gestation (eg, sole creases, scalp
hair) [20]. Stillbirth was defined as a birth where the infant was
recorded as stillborn by the clinician and had an Apgar score of
zero at 1 minute and 5 minutes following birth. This definition
is consistent with previously published definitions [21].
Maternal Characteristics
Maternal age, preexisting medical conditions, the occurrence of
medical complications during pregnancy (including preeclamp-
sia, gestational diabetes, threatened abortion, threatened pre-
term labor, and urinary tract infections), and smoking during
pregnancy (yes/no) were obtained from the midwives’ records.
Indigenous status was defined using a previously validated algo-
rithm drawing from multiple government administrative data
sets [22]. The statistical local area of the mother at the time of
birth was used to calculate a Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas
(SEIFA) score. Statistical local areas are Australian Standard Gov-
ernment Classification–defined local areas that cover the whole of
Australia. SEIFA is comprised of several indices, the main index
being that of the relative disadvantage that is derived from low
income, low educational attainment, high unemployment, and
jobs in unskilled occupations [23]. SEIFA scores were grouped
into quintiles. Statistical local areas were also used to assign indi-
viduals into levels of remoteness of their residence based on the
Accessibility and Remoteness Index (ARIA) scale, a national
index developed by the National Centre for Social Applications
of Geographic Information Systems. ARIA scores are based on
road distance measurements from the statistical local area of res-
idence to the nearest populated locality >1000 persons; scores
range from 1 (highly accessible) to 5 (highly remote) [24].
Statistical Analysis
The odds of vaccination and stillbirth were compared by mater-
nal characteristics using binomial logistic regression models.
The odds of stillbirth were also compared by influenza virus cir-
culation at 3 time periods: pre–influenza season, influenza sea-
son, and post–influenza season. Pre–influenza season was
defined as 1 April–3 June 2012 and 1 January–14 July 2013; in-
fluenza season was defined as 4 June–23 September 2012 and 15
July–13 October 2013; and post–influenza season was defined
as 24 September–31 December 2012 and 14 October–31 De-
cember 2013 (Figure 1). Seasonal cut-points were determined
based on statewide notifications for laboratory-confirmed influ-
enza during 2012 and 2013.
Similar to previous investigations [6, 25, 26], we used Cox re-
gression models to compare the risk of stillbirth in vaccinated
and unvaccinated women. Days of gestation from 20 weeks
was included as the underlying time variable and vaccination
status as the time-dependent exposure variable. Because 62%
of vaccinated women were immunized after 20 weeks of preg-
nancy (ie, during the observation period), vaccinated women

 contributed unvaccinated person-time until their date of vacci-
nation. Because influenza vaccine uptake was more common in
our cohort in women with higher-risk pregnancies [17], models
were adjusted by propensity of vaccination to avoid potential
confounding by indication. Propensity scores for vaccination
were derived from the linear predictor (rather than the predict-
ed probability) of a logistic regression model with maternal age,
SEIFA and ARIA scores, primiparity, multiple births, preexist-
ing medical conditions, and complications of pregnancy as
independent variables and vaccination status as the dependent
variable. Propensity scores ranged from –0.68 to 1.07 (median,
0.23 [interquartile range, 0.05–0.44]). Models were also adjust-
ed for Indigenous status of the mother and self-reported smok-
ing during pregnancy.
To estimate the effect in births following influenza season
compared to the effect in births prior to influenza season, we cal-
culated a ratio of hazard ratios (HRs) using the approach outlined
by Altman and Bland [27]. Hazards regression models were also
created to compare the risk of stillbirth in preterm pregnancies
(<37 weeks) and full-term pregnancies (≥37 weeks), and for 5
levels of propensity for vaccination (strata 1, −0.69 to 0.01; strata
2, 0.02–0.15; strata 3, 0.16–0.30; strata 4, 0.31–0.50; strata 5, 0.51–
1.07). All covariates were tested to determine whether models
met the assumption of proportional hazards (α = .05).
RESULTS
A total of 59 333 midwives records were provided for linkage
with a date of birth from 1 April 2012 to 31 December 2013.
Of these, 1325 were excluded because the mother resided out-
side Western Australia (n = 71) or had missing covariate infor-
mation (n = 1254), leaving 58 008 births for analysis. A total of
5541 births were linked to an influenza vaccination record, of
which 5076 (92%) had a date of administration ≥14 days
prior to the date of delivery. Therefore, the final dataset includ-
ed 58 008 births, 5076 to vaccinated mothers and 52 932 to un-
vaccinated mothers (Figure 2), contributing 7 716 084 days of
follow-up during pregnancy (462 808 days vaccinated and
7 253 276 days unvaccinated). The majority of births included
in the analysis were to mothers who were <35 years of age
(80%), non-Indigenous (94%), and in the top 20% socioeco-
nomic (SEIFA) level (65%); 44% resided in a metropolitan area.
Influenza Vaccination
Overall, 8.7% of the cohort received seasonal influenza vaccine
during their pregnancy (6.9% in 2012% and 10.2% in 2013).
The proportion of births to vaccinated mothers ranged from
0.5% in April 2012 to 15.8% in August 2013, with the number
of doses administered to pregnant women peaking in April
each year (Figure 1); 18.7% of vaccinated mothers were immu-
nized in the first 13 weeks of pregnancy; 45.7% were immunized
in weeks 14–27 of their pregnancy; and 35.6% were immunized
in week 28 or later of pregnancy. Vaccination was more common
among women >35 years of age (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 1.01–1.15), women residing in highly acces-
sible areas (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.86–2.54), and women in the
highest socioeconomic level (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.09–1.45).
Women with preexisting medical conditions were more likely
to receive an influenza vaccine (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.38–1.54),
as were women with preeclampsia (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.11–
1.57) or gestational diabetes (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.21–1.48). Pri-
miparous women and women with multiple births were also
more likely to be vaccinated compared to multiparous women
and women with a singleton pregnancy (OR, 1.14; 95% CI,
1.07–1.21 and OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.15–1.58, respectively)
(Table 1).

 Stillbirth
During the observation period, 377 stillbirths occurred, equat-
ing to 6.5 per 1000 births overall. Stillbirth was more common
among women with diabetes (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.44–5.93) or
hypertension (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.92–5.88), women who
smoked during pregnancy (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.07–1.89), and
Indigenous women (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.47–2.83) (Table 2).
Stillbirth was less common among women in the highest socio-
economic level (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, .44–.99) and women residing
in highly accessible areas (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, .46–.97). Women
with a multiple pregnancy had 4 times the odds of stillbirth
compared to women with a singleton pregnancy (OR, 4.08;
95% CI, 2.89–5.75). The majority (66.4%) of stillbirths in the
cohort occurred between 20 and 27 weeks’ gestation. Although
not statistically significant, stillbirth was more common during
the post–influenza season compared with the pre–influenza
season (P = .07; Table 2).
The unadjusted incidence of stillbirth in unvaccinated moth-
ers was 5.0 per 100 000 pregnancy-days compared with 3.0 per
100 000 pregnancy-days in vaccinated women (Table 3). The
adjusted risk of stillbirth was 51% lower among vaccinated
women compared with unvaccinated women (adjusted hazard
ratio [aHR], 0.49; 95% CI, .29–.84). Of the 465 women who
were vaccinated <14 days before the date of delivery (ie, classi-
fied as unvaccinated for this analysis), none had a stillbirth.

 When comparing the rate of stillbirth by gestational age, a sig-
nificant reduction in stillbirths among vaccinated mothers was
only observed for stillbirths occurring prior to 37 weeks of ges-
tation (aHR, 0.45; 95% CI, .26–.81). There was a nonsignificant
reduction in stillbirth associated with maternal influenza vacci-
nation prior to the start of the influenza season (aHR, 0.60; 95%
CI, .22–1.61) and during the influenza season (aHR, 0.57; 95%
CI, .25–1.31); however, a greater and significant reduction was
observed for births occurring during the post–influenza season
period (aHR, 0.33; 95% CI, .12–.88) (Figure 3). The ratio of HRs
during the post–influenza season period compared with the
pre–influenza season period was 0.55 (95% CI, .13–2.49), sug-
gesting that the effect of vaccination may be greater following
influenza season.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first population-based study of
seasonal TIV and stillbirth, and the largest cohort study to
date evaluating maternal vaccination and stillbirth. We ob-
served a reduced hazard of stillbirth associated with seasonal
TIV administered during pregnancy after controlling for risk
factors for stillbirth and accounting for factors associated with
disproportionate uptake of maternal vaccination. These results
are consistent with those of previous large cohort studies inves-
tigating the perinatal impact of pandemic and monovalent in-
fluenza vaccination in pregnancy [13–16, 26], and support the
safety of antenatal administration of seasonal TIV.
Several findings in our study support an association between
influenza infection and stillbirth. The observed rate of stillbirth
was higher following periods of influenza virus circulation (eg,
November–December) compared with periods prior to influen-
za season (eg, January–May). Although seasonal differences
were not statistically significant (P = .07), these results suggest
a possible temporal association between stillbirth and influenza
season. Researchers in Finland observed seasonal patterns in the
population incidence of stillbirth, with the highest rates of still-
birth occurring just after influenza season in the northern hemi-
sphere (March) and the lowest rates in summer and autumn
[28]. Furthermore, the effect estimate between vaccination
and stillbirth was greater during the post–influenza season pe-
riod compared with the pre–influenza season period. Addition-
al studies should further evaluate the possible temporal
association between stillbirth and influenza season.
Our results are consistent with those of previous large cohort
studies of maternal influenza vaccination during an influenza
pandemic [13–15, 26]. Although observational cohort studies,
such as ours, are subject to potential bias, including uncon-
trolled confounding due to the nature of the study design
[13], there are several strengths to this large observational co-
hort study. First, observational cohort studies are the most effi-
cient method of measuring the impact of maternal influenza
vaccination on stillbirth, given the relatively low incidence of
stillbirth in developed countries and potentially low uptake of
vaccine [13]. With an incidence of 6.4 stillbirths per 1000 births

Stillbirth and Maternal Influenza Vaccination • CID 2016:62 (15 May) • 1225

 in Australia [29], other study designs such as randomized con-
trolled trials would be implausible, as well as unethical, given
that maternal influenza vaccination is now recommended as
standard of care. Second, previous observational cohort studies
have taken measures to prevent uncontrolled confounding,
including propensity score adjustment [26] and controlling
for known maternal risk factors [15], and have observed a
significant protective effect of maternal vaccination. Similar to
these investigations, we stratified our analyses by the mother’s
propensity for vaccination and adjusted for known maternal
risk factors for stillbirth. Regardless of maternal risk factors
and differing predisposition to vaccination, stillbirth was signif-
icantly less common in vaccinated mothers compared to
unvaccinated.
Despite the strengths of this cohort study, there are several lim-
itations to our cohort which should be considered. Measurement
of vaccination status in this cohort is thought to have been in-
complete. In the absence of a registry of adult vaccinations in
Australia, we relied on provider-reported vaccination events,
and there was no legal requirement to report these vaccinations.
An evaluation of the completeness of reporting for maternal in-
fluenza vaccinations in Western Australia found that approxi-
mately half (46%) get reported to the state vaccination database
[30]. In addition, a postpartum survey of mothers in Western
Australia who delivered in April–October in 2012 and 2013 indi-
cated that 26% and 36% (respectively) had received an influenza
vaccination during the study period [17]. In our cohort, 9% and
14% of mothers were reportedly immunized during these respec-
tive time periods. However, because false positives (ie, reporting a
vaccination when one did not occur) are very unlikely in the vac-
cination database [30], exposure misclassification in our cohort
would likely bias our results toward the null, indicating the pro-
tective effect between vaccinations and stillbirths that we ob-
served may be an underestimate of the true effect measure.
Second, our cohort was restricted to the Australian setting over
2 influenza seasons; therefore, our results may not be generaliz-
able to developing countries, where stillbirth is more common, or
influenza seasons for which the protection afforded by the vac-
cine might be different. Finally, due to low number of outcomes

 in our dataset, we were unable to compare the safety of seasonal
influenza vaccine by trimester of administration. Future research
should examine whether the lower incidence of stillbirth associat-
ed with antenatal influenza vaccinations we observed is applicable
to other influenza seasons and settings and across trimesters of
vaccine administration.
CONCLUSIONS
Our results support the safety of maternal influenza vaccination,
as we found no increase in the risk of stillbirth in vaccinated
women. Additional research is needed to confirm the potential
reduction in stillbirth observed in this cohort study. There are
>3 million stillborn infants each year worldwide, and in devel-
oped countries stillbirth accounts for 70% of perinatal deaths
[31]; confirmation of these findings would indicate that season-
al influenza vaccination in pregnancy has substantial perinatal
health benefits. These results may be useful for communicating
the potential benefits of seasonal influenza vaccination to preg-
nant mothers and their providers. Given the growing body of
evidence supporting the health benefits to mother and infant,
concerted efforts are needed to improve seasonal influenza vac-
cine coverage among pregnant women.
