Abstract
Prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems insert spacers derived from viruses and other 
parasitic DNA elements into CRISPR loci to provide sequence-specific immunity1,2. This 
frequently results in high within-population spacer diversity3–6, but it is unclear if and why this is 
important. Here we show that, as a result of this spacer diversity, viruses can no longer evolve to 
overcome CRISPR-Cas by point mutation, which results in rapid virus extinction. This effect 
arises from synergy between spacer diversity and the high specificity of infection, which greatly 
increases overall population resistance. We propose that the resulting short-lived nature of 
CRISPR-dependent bacteria–virus coevolution has provided strong selection for the evolution of 
sophisticated virus-encoded anti-CRISPR mechanisms7.

 We previously reported that Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain UCBPP-PA14 evolves high 
levels of CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats; CRISPR-
associated) adaptive immunity against virus DMS3vir under laboratory conditions6. 
However, viruses can readily evolve to overcome sequence-specific CRISPR immunity8,9. 
To study how CRISPR-Cas impacts virus persistence, we measured titres of virus DMS3vir 
over time upon infection of either wild-type P. aeruginosa or a functional CRISPR-Cas 
knockout (CRISPR KO) strain. Virus that infected the wild-type strain went extinct at 5 days 
post-infection (d.p.i.) (Fig. 1a), whereas virus infecting the CRISPR KO strain persisted in 
all replicates until the experiment was terminated at 30 d.p.i. (Fig. 1b). Wild-type bacteria 
exclusively evolved CRISPR-mediated immunity, while the CRISPR KO strain evolved 
immunity by mutation, loss or masking of the receptor (that is, surface mutation) (Extended 
Data Fig. 1a). The observation that CRISPR-Cas drives virus extinct so rapidly was 
unexpected since viruses can escape CRISPR immunity by a single point mutation8,9.
Virus extinction might result from the high level of spacer diversity that naturally evolves 
upon virus exposure in this and other CRISPR-Cas systems3–6. Both theory and data suggest 
that host genetic diversity can synergistically reduce the spread of parasites if the infection 
process is specific (that is, a parasite genotype can infect a restricted number of host 
genotypes) and a failed infection results in parasite death10–18; assumptions that hold for 
CRISPR-Cas-virus interactions. While the protective effect of host diversity may be lost 
following the evolution of single viruses that escape from multiple spacers10,17, host 
diversity has the additional benefit of limiting such viral adaptation. Specifically, lower virus 
population sizes resulting from host diversity11,12 reduces the probability of escape 
mutations, and the greater the diversity the more escape mutations needed.
To examine these hypotheses, we generated bacterial populations in which we manipulated 
the level of spacer diversity; we used 48 individual clones with CRISPR-based immunity 
against virus DMS3vir to generate bacterial populations with five distinct diversity levels: 
monocultures or polycultures consisting of equal mixtures of either 6, 12, 24 or 48 clones. 
To allow for direct comparisons, each of the 48 clones was equally represented at each 
diversity level by adjusting the number of replicate experiments accordingly. Each 
population was competed against a previously described surface mutant6 in the presence or 
absence of virus DMS3vir and virus levels were monitored over time.
This experiment revealed a strong inverse relationship between virus persistence and the 
level of spacer diversity in the bacterial population (Fig. 2). Virus titres remained high in 44 
out of 48 replicates when the CRISPR population consisted of a monoculture (Fig. 2a). 
However, as diversity increased, virus persistence decreased (Fig. 2b–e) and virus was 
driven extinct rapidly and reproducibly when the CRISPR population consisted of a 48-
clone mixture (Fig. 2e).
Next, we examined the fitness consequences of generating spacer diversity. In the absence of 
virus there was no significant effect of diversity on the relative fitness associated with 
CRISPR-Cas compared with a resistant surface mutant (Extended Data Fig. 1b; F1,52 =3.20, 
P =0.08). However, in the presence of virus, CRISPR-associated fitness increased with 
increasing spacer diversity (Fig. 3; F4,71 =40.30, P <0.0001 and Extended Data Table 1),

 with mean fitness increasing 11-fold from monoculture to the highest diversity population. 
In monoculture, the CRISPR population was outcompeted by the surface mutant (relative 
fitness <1; T =−11.68, P < 0.0001). However, as diversity increased, the CRISPR population 
consistently outcompeted the surface mutant (relative fitness >1; 6 clones: T =3.05, P = 
0.0093; 12 clones: T =3.95, P = 0.0028; 24 clones: T =3.48, P = 0.0088; 48 clones: T =3.06, 
P = 0.014; all significant after sequential Bonferroni correction19), showing that the 
generation of spacer diversity is an important fitness determinant of CRISPR-Cas (Fig. 3).
Given that all bacterial clones used in the experiment were initially resistant, we 
hypothesized that the benefit of spacer diversity emerges from an inability of virus to evolve 
escape mutants. To examine this, virus isolated from each time point (0, 16, 24, 40, 48, 64 
and 72 hours post-infection (h.p.i.)) was spotted onto lawns of each of the 48 CRISPR 
clones. As expected, we could not detect escape virus in the ancestral virus (Fig. 4a; left 
column, indicated in green). However, in 43 of the 48 CRISPR monocultures, virus evolved 
within 2 days to overcome CRISPR immunity (Fig. 4a, indicated in red). For five clones no 
escape virus could be detected, and virus became extinct in four of these instances (Fig. 4a, 
asterisks). Three of these five clones carried multiple spacers targeting the virus, which 
limits the emergence of escape virus16. The emergence of escape virus decreased as 
diversity increased to 6, 12, 24 and 48 CRISPR alleles (Fig. 4); in the last two, no escape 
virus could be detected. These phenotypic data were supported by results of deep 
sequencing of virus genotypes isolated from 1 d.p.i.: there was a significant inverse 
relationship between host diversity and the accumulation of viral mutations in the target 
sequences (Extended Data Fig. 1c, d). This is because virus needs to overcome multiple 
spacers in the diverse host population if it is to increase in frequency (Extended Data Fig. 1e, 
f). Consistent with a lack of escape virus emerging against all host genotypes, the spacer 
content of mixed populations of 6, 12, 24 and 48 clones did not increase between t =0 and t 
= 3 d.p.i. (Wilcoxon signed rank P > 0.2 for all treatments), whereas monocultures acquired 
novel spacers in response to emerging escape virus (Wilcoxon signed rank W =333, d.f.=47, 
P <0.0001; Extended Data Fig. 1g). These data show that although escape viruses can 
clearly evolve against most of the clones, they do not emerge when these clones are mixed.
We hypothesized that the benefit of within-population spacer diversity is due to synergy 
between the different clones. However, diversity will also increase the chance that the 
population will contain a single clone with one or more spacers that the virus is unable to 
overcome. Indeed, we observed five clones against which escape virus mutants were never 
detected, and presence of these clones in many of the diverse populations could explain the 
fitness advantage of diversity. To investigate if synergy plays an important role in the benefit 
of diversity beyond this ‘jackpot’ effect, we compared the fitness of diverse populations with 
the fitness of the fittest constituent clone, as measured in monoculture. This analysis 
revealed that synergism contributed an approximately 50% growth rate advantage when in 
competition with surface mutants (mean ± s.e.m. difference in fitness between mixtures and 
fittest constituent monoculture =0.47±0.18; P <0.01).
The short-lived nature of coevolution between CRISPR-resistant bacteria and virus escape 
mutants beyond a host diversity threshold may explain the evolution of sophisticated anti-
CRISPR mechanisms to overcome CRISPR-Cas7. Indeed, the same DMS3vir virus carrying

 an anti-CRISPR gene7 was found to persist independent of CRISPR diversity levels 
(Extended Data Fig. 1h, i) and caused similar extinction of CRISPR-resistant monocultures 
and 48-clone populations that competed against a surface mutant (Fisher’s exact test, P =1.0 
at t =1 d.p.i., P =0.33 at t = 3 d.p.i.; Extended Data Fig. 1j).
Finally, to test that our results were not limited to the P. aeruginosa PA14 type I-F CRISPR-
Cas system, we performed a similar experiment with Streptococcus thermophilus 
DGCC7710 clones that evolved resistance against virus 2972 using a type II-A CRISPR-Cas 
system. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 2, we found a similar effect of CRISPR resistance 
allele diversity on virus persistence and escape virus emergence. However, during 
coevolution experiments the levels of evolved spacer diversity are lower in S. thermophilus 
(data not shown and refs 4, 5), which, consistent with theory10,17, allows for more persistent 
coevolution4,5. Lower levels of evolved spacer diversity might be due to a more weakly 
primed CRISPR-Cas system20–22.
Collectively, our data demonstrate that the propensity to generate host genetic diversity is a 
key fitness determinant of CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems because it limits the 
emergence of escape virus. Consistent with the idea that it is harder for a parasite to adapt to 
a heterogeneous host population23, virus rapidly evolved high levels of infectivity on 
monocultures, but not on a diverse mix of the same host genotypes. Parasites are often 
invoked as the selective force driving the evolution of diversity generating mechanisms23–26. 
In most cases, individual-level selection is assumed to be the driver of these traits, because 
individual benefits are high, and group selective benefits would be opposed by the invasion 
of individuals who do not pay the fitness costs associated with these mechanisms (for 
example, sex and increased mutation rates)26–28. In the case of CRISPR-Cas, we speculate 
that population-level selection may have contributed to its evolution. First, there were large 
benefits associated with synergy between diverse genotypes. Second, costs of CRISPR-Cas 
are conditional on virus exposure6,29, and clones lacking CRISPR immunity cannot invade 
populations (Extended Data Figs 3 and 4). Third, the highly structured nature of bacterial 
populations, and the resulting high relatedness, promotes between-population selection30. 
Future tests of this hypothesis are needed to reconcile the selective forces that have shaped 
the evolution of CRISPR-Cas systems.
 METHODS
The experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation 
during experiments and outcome assessment.
 Bacterial strains and viruses
P. aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 (WT), P. aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 csy3::LacZ (referred to as 
CRISPR KO, which carries a disruption of an essential cas gene and can therefore not evolve 
CRISPR immunity), the CRISPR- KO-derived surface mutant and virus DMS3vir have all 
been described in ref. 6 and references therein. Phage DMS3vir+acrF1, which carries the 
anti-CRISPR gene acrF1 (formerly 30–35), was made by inserting acrF1 into the DMS3vir 
genome using methods described in ref. 7. S. thermophilus strain DGCC7710 and its virus 
2972 have been described in ref. 2.

  Coevolution experiments
The coevolution experiments shown in Fig. 1 were performed in glass microcosms by 
inoculating 6 ml M9 supplemented with 0.2% glucose with approximately 106 colony-
forming units of bacteria from fresh overnight cultures of the wild-type P. aeruginosa 
UCBPP-PA14 or CRISPR KO strain and adding 104 p.f.u. of virus DMS3vir, followed by 
incubation at 37 °C while shaking at 180 r.p.m. (six replicates). Cultures were transferred 
daily 1:100 to fresh broth. Virus titres were determined at 0, 3, 5, 11, 17, 22 and 30 days 
after the start of the coevolution experiment by spotting virus samples isolated by 
chloroform extraction on a lawn of CRISPR KO bacteria. The analysis of virus immunity 
was performed by cross-streak assay and PCR as described previously6.
 Generation of populations with different levels of CRISPR diversity
For the competition experiments, shown in Figs 2–4 and Extended Data Figs 1b–j, 3 and 4, 
we generated P. aeruginosa populations with varying levels of CRISPR spacer (allele) 
diversity. To this end, we isolated from the six replicates of the coevolution experiment (Fig. 
1) a total of 48 individual clones that had acquired CRISPR immunity against virus 
DMS3vir. We have previously shown that individual clones tend to have unique spacers6. 
Using these 48 clones, populations with five different levels of CRISPR spacer (allele) 
diversity were generated. These populations consisted of (1) 1 clone (a monoculture; a 
clonal population carrying a single spacer); equal mixtures of (2) 6 clones; (3) 12 clones; (4) 
24 clones and (5) 48 clones. In total, 48 different monocultures (48 × monocultures), 8× 6-
clone populations, 4 × 12-clone populations, 2 × 24-clone populations and 1 × 48-clone 
population were generated (details of the composition of each population can be found 
below, in the section ‘Number of replicate experiments’).
 Competition experiments
Competition experiments were done in glass microcosms in a total volume of 6 ml M9 
supplemented with 0.2% glucose. Competition experiments were initiated by inoculating 
1:100 from a 1:1 mixture (in M9 salts) of overnight cultures of the appropriate CRISPR 
population and either the surface mutant (Figs 2–4 and Extended Data Fig. 1b–j) or the 
CRISPR KO strain (Extended Data Figs 3 and 4). At the start of each experiment 109 p.f.u. 
of virus was added, unless indicated otherwise. Cultures were transferred daily 1:100 into 
fresh broth. At 0 and 72 h.p.i. samples were taken and cells were serially diluted in M9 salts 
and plated on LB agar supplemented with 50 μgml−1 X-gal (to allow discrimination between 
wild-type-derived CRISPR clones (white) and CRISPR KO or surface mutant (blue)). The 
relative frequencies of the wild-type strain were used to calculate the relative fitness (relative 
fitness = [(fraction strain A at t =x) × (1 − (fraction strain A at t = 0))]/[(fraction strain A at t 
=0) × (1 − (fraction strain A at t =x)]). At 0, 16, 24, 40, 48, 66 and 72 h.p.i., samples were 
taken and chloroform extractions were performed to isolate total virus, which was spotted on 
a lawn of CRISPR KO bacteria for quantification. All subsequent statistical analyses were 
performed using JMP (version 12) software.

  Determination of escape virus emergence
To determine the emergence of escape virus during the competition experiments, every 
isolated virus sample was spotted onto 48 different bacterial lawns, corresponding to each of 
the different CRISPR clones. This procedure was done for each of the seven time points (see 
above), to enable us to track the emergence of escape virus against every individual clone 
over the time course of the experiment.
 Deep sequencing
Isolated phage samples from t = 1 d.p.i. of the competition experiment shown in Figs 2–4 
were used to perform deep sequencing of spacer target sites on the phage genomes. To 
obtain sufficient material, phage were amplified by plaque assay on the CRISPR KO strain. 
Viruses from all replicates within a single diversity treatment were pooled. As a control, 
ancestral virus and escape virus from competition between surface mutant and monocultures 
of CRISPR clones 1–3 were processed in parallel. Virus genomic DNA extraction was 
performed from 5 ml sample at approximately 1010 p.f.u. ml−1 using the Norgen phage DNA 
isolation kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Barcoded Illumina Truseq Nano 
libraries were constructed from each DNA sample with an approximately 350 bp insert size 
and 2 × 250 bp reads generated on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Reads were trimmed using 
Cutadapt version 1.2.1 and Sickle version 1.200 and then overlapping reads merged using 
Flash version 1.2.8 to create high quality sequence at approximately 8,000× coverage of 
DMS3vir per sample. These reads were mapped to PA14 and DMS3vir genomes using bwa 
mem version 0.7.12 and allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms within viral 
target regions quantified using samtools mpileup version 0.1.18. Further statistical analyses 
was performed in R version 3.2.2. Sequence data are available from the European 
Nucleotide Archive under accession number PRJEB12001 and analysis scripts are available 
from https://github.com/scottishwormboy/vanHoute.
 Determining the acquisition of new spacers
To examine spacer acquisition during the competition experiments shown in Figs 2–4, we 
examined by PCR for each diversity treatment the spacer content of 384 randomly isolated 
clones at both t =0 and t = 3 (192 clones per time point). For each replicate experiment, the 
difference in the total number of spacers between t =0 and t = 3 was divided by the number 
of clones that were examined to calculate the average change in the number of spacers per 
clone.
 Number of replicate experiments
To ensure equal representation of each of the 48 clones across the different treatments, the 
number of replicate experiments for a given diversity treatment was adjusted accordingly, 
with a total number of replicates of at least six for sufficient statistical power. Hence, 
competition experiments with the one-clone (monoculture) populations were performed in 
48 independent replicates, each corresponding to a unique monoculture of a CRISPR clone 
(clones 1–48; each clone is equally represented). Competition experiments with the 6-clone 
populations were performed in eight independent replicates, each corresponding to a unique 
polyculture population (population 1: equal mixture of clones 1–6; population 2: clones 7–

 12; population 3: clones 13–18; population 4: clones 19–24; population 5: clones 25–30; 
population 6: clones 31–36; population 7: clones 37–42; population 8: clones 43–48). 
Competition experiments with the 12-clone populations were also performed in eight 
replicates, corresponding to four unique polyculture populations (replicate 1 and 2: clones 
1–12; replicate 3 and 4: clones 13–24; replicate 5 and 6: clones 25–36; replicate 7 and 8: 
clones 37–48). Competition experiments with the 24-clone populations were performed in 
six replicates, corresponding to two unique polyculture populations (replicate 1–3: clones 1–
24; replicate 4–6: clones 25–48). Competition experiments with the 48-clone populations 
were performed in six replicates, each corresponding to the same polyculture population 
(replicate 1–6: clones 1–48).
 Escape phage degradation and fitness
In the experiment shown in Extended Data Fig. 1e, f, approximately 108 p.f.u. of either 
ancestral virus or escape virus, which was isolated from the competitions between 
monocultures 1–6 and the surface mutant, were used to infect a monoculture of the 
corresponding CRISPR clone or the 48-clone polyculture. Phage samples were taken at 0, 9, 
20 and 28 h.p.i. by chloroform extraction and titrated on a lawn of the CRISPR KO strain. 
Fitness of each of the escape phages was determined by a competition experiment between 
ancestral and escape virus; a 50:50 ratio of escape and ancestral phage (109 p.f.u. total) was 
used to infect either a monoculture of the corresponding CRISPR clone or the 48-clone 
polyculture. Virus samples were taken at t =0 and t =20h.p.i. by chloroform extraction and 
used in a plaque assay on CRISPR KO. Next, individual plaques (48 plaques per replicate) 
were isolated and amplified on the CRISPR KO strain. To determine the ratio of escape and 
ancestral virus, virus from each individual plaque was spotted on a lawn of (1) CRISPR KO 
(both ancestral and escape virus form plaques) and (2) the corresponding CRISPR immune 
clone (only escape virus can form a plaque).
 Effect of spacer diversity in S. thermophilus
S. thermophilus DGCC7710 was grown in M17 medium supplemented with 0.5% α-lactose 
(LM17) at 42 °C. Virus 2972 was used throughout the experiments. Virus infections were 
performed using 106 p.f.u. of phage 2972 and 10 mM CaCl2 to facilitate the infection 
process. To obtain virus-resistant S. thermophilus clones, a sample of virus lysate at 24 h.p.i. 
was plated on LM17 agar plates. Individual colonies were picked and PCR-screened for the 
acquisition of novel spacers in each of the four CRISPR loci, as described in ref. 2. A total 
of 44 individual clones with a novel spacer in CRISPR1 (see ref. 16 and references therein) 
were selected to generate 44 monocultures and a single polyculture comprising a mix of 44 
clones. These cultures were infected with 107 p.f.u. of virus, and samples were taken after 
the indicated periods of time to isolate virus. We determined virus titres by spotting viral 
dilutions on lawns of ancestral bacteria, and the emergence of escape virus by spotting virus 
on lawns corresponding to each of the 44 CRISPR-resistant clones.

represented in each treatment. Each line indicates a biological replicate experiment. The 
limit of detection is 200 p.f.u. ml−1. f, Relative fitness of CRISPR populations at 3 d.p.i. 
during the competitions with the sensitive CRISPR KO described in a–e. Relative fitness of 
CRISPR populations decreases with increasing spacer diversity due to the rapid virus 
extinction, which benefits sensitive bacteria, but is higher than 1 in all cases. Error bars, 95% 
CI. g, Relative fitness of monoculture (single spacer; low diversity, n = 48) and polyculture 
(48 spacers; high diversity, n = 6) at 3 d.p.i. when competing with the CRISPR KO strain in 
the absence of virus. Error bars, 95% CI. In all cases n is the number of biological replicates.
