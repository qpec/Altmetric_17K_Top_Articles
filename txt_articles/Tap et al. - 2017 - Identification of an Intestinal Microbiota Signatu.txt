BACKGROUND & AIMS: We have limited knowledge about the
association between the composition of the intestinal micro-
biota and clinical features of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
We collected information on the fecal and mucosa-associated
microbiota of patients with IBS and evaluated whether these
were associated with symptoms. METHODS: We collected fecal
and mucosal samples from adult patients who met the Rome III
criteria for IBS at a secondary/tertiary care outpatient clinics in
Sweden, as well as from healthy subjects. The exploratory set
comprised 149 subjects (110 with IBS and 39 healthy subjects);
232 fecal samples and 59 mucosal biopsy samples were
collected and analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA targeted pyro-
sequencing. The validation set comprised 46 subjects (29 with
IBS and 17 healthy subjects); 46 fecal samples, but no mucosal
samples, were collected and analyzed. For each subject, we
measured exhaled H2 and CH4, oro-anal transit time, and the
severity of psychological and gastrointestinal symptoms. Fecal
methanogens were measured by quantitative polymerase chain
reaction. Numerical ecology analyses and a machine learning
procedure were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Fecal
microbiota showed covariation with mucosal adherent micro-
biota. By using classic approaches, we found no differences in
fecal microbiota abundance or composition between patients
with IBS vs healthy patients. A machine learning procedure, a
computational statistical technique, allowed us to reduce the
16S ribosomal RNA data complexity into a microbial signature
for severe IBS, consisting of 90 bacterial operational taxonomic
units. We confirmed the robustness of the intestinal microbial
signature for severe IBS in the validation set. The signature was
able to discriminate between patients with severe symptoms,
patients with mild/moderate symptoms, and healthy subjects.
By using this intestinal microbiota signature, we found IBS
symptom severity to be associated negatively with microbial
richness,
exhaled
CH4,
presence
of
methanogens,
and
enterotypes enriched with Clostridiales or Prevotella species.
This microbiota signature could not be explained by differences
in diet or use of medications. CONCLUSIONS: In analyzing fecal
and mucosal microbiota from patients with IBS and healthy
individuals, we identified an intestinal microbiota profile that is
associated with the severity of IBS symptoms. Trial registration
number: NCT01252550.

I
rritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent
functional gastrointestinal disorder in Western soci-
eties. It affects approximately 11% of the adult population
and strongly impairs quality of life, social function, work
productivity, and brings substantial costs to health care
services.1 The etiology of IBS remains poorly understood
and the search for biomarkers is ongoing.2
It is now well accepted that IBS is a disorder involving
multiple pathophysiological mechanisms in which composi-
tion of gut microbiota has been proposed as one of the
potentially important factors.3,4 Since the first study that
investigated the fecal microbiota composition of IBS patients
and healthy subjects using a molecular-based approach,5
many studies have followed using targeted approaches,6
specifically quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).6,7
More recently, the use of advanced tools has allowed a
better overview of gut microbiota composition,6,8,9 func-
tion,10 and metabolite production11,12 in IBS. Even though gut
microbiota alterations seem to exist in IBS, no uniform gut
microbiota pattern in IBS has been shown. The existing
inconsistencies among currently available data in IBS may be
attributed to several factors including heterogeneity of gut
microbiota profiling methods, inherent individual microbiota
variability, and differences in inclusion criteria, as well as
sample size. This highlights the difficulty in finding robust
microbiota markers associated with IBS clinical parameters,3

 and shows the need for large and well-characterized cohorts
to obtain valid and reliable analyses of the association be-
tween clinical symptoms and microbiota composition and
function in IBS.
Fecal microbiota has been the target of most studies
because of its convenient accessibility. However, mucosal
microbiota is of great interest given its proximity to host cells
because host–microbe interactions have been proposed to be
of relevance for symptom generation in IBS.4 Although the
analysis of mucosal microbiota involves more invasive
sampling
methods,
several
studies
have
investigated
colonic
mucosal
samples
obtained
by
sigmoidoscopy,
either after bowel cleansing13 or using unprepared biopsy
specimens.14–16 The use of unprepared biopsy samples offers
the advantage to avoid perturbation of the microbiota
composition.17
Large
cohort
studies
in
IBS
patients
combining paired microbiota samples originating from fecal
and mucosa samples are rare, but a few smaller studies using
next-generation sequencing exist.13,16
Thus, there is currently a need for an improved under-
standing of gut microbiota composition in IBS patients and
for the potential role played by the gut microbiota in the
generation of IBS symptoms. In this study, we therefore
aimed to determine the fecal and mucosa-associated micro-
biota, and the link to clinical symptoms in a large and
well-characterized cohort of IBS patients.
Materials and Methods
Subject Recruitment and Study Design
Adult patients, aged 18–65 years and fulfilling the Rome III
criteria18 for IBS, were included prospectively at a secondary/
tertiary care outpatient clinic (Sahlgrenska University Hospital,
Gothenburg, Sweden). The diagnosis was based on a typical
clinical presentation and additional investigations if considered
necessary by the gastroenterologist (H.T. or M.S.). Classification
into IBS subtypes according to the Rome III criteria was
performed based on Bristol Stool Form scale characteristics: IBS
with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), mixed IBS
(IBS-M), or unsubtyped IBS.18 Exclusion criteria included the use
of probiotics or antibiotics during the study period or within 1
month before inclusion, another diagnosis that could explain the
gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, severe psychiatric disease as the
dominant clinical problem, other severe diseases, and a history of
drug or alcohol abuse. A healthy control group was recruited by
use of advertisement and checked by interview and a question-
naire to exclude chronic diseases and any current GI symptoms.
All participants provided written informed consent to
participate after verbal and written information about the study.
The Regional Ethical Review Board at the University of Gothen-
burg approved the study before the start of subject inclusion.
Subject Characterization
Demographic information and body mass index were ob-
tained in all subjects. IBS patients reported their current use of
medications and completed questionnaires to characterize their
symptom severity and bowel habits. The IBS Severity Scoring
System (IBS-SSS),19 the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD)
scale,20 a 4-day food diary,21 and a 2-week stool diary based on
the Bristol stool form scale.22 IBS severity was based on vali-
dated cut-off scores on IBS-SSS (mild IBS, IBS-SSS score < 175;
moderate IBS, IBS-SSS score of 175–300; and severe IBS, IBS-
SSS score > 300).19
The oro-anal transit time (OATT) (radiopaque marker
study)23 and the amount of exhaled H2 and CH4 after an
overnight fast (ie, not after intake of any substrate), also was
determined in IBS patients (see Supplementary Material for
more details).
Fecal and Mucosal Sample Collections and
DNA Extraction
Fecal samples were collected from 195 subjects in RNAlater
solution (Ambion, Courtaboeuf, France). For most of the IBS
subjects, 2 fecal samples were collected (average, 26 ± 16 days
between the 2 samples). A first set, referred to as the explor-
atory set, comprised 149 subjects (110 IBS and 39 healthy
subjects), from whom 232 fecal samples and 59 biopsy samples
were collected and analyzed. A second set, referred to as the
validation set, comprised 46 subjects (29 IBS and 17 healthy
subjects), from whom 46 fecal samples, but no biopsy samples,
were collected and analyzed (Supplementary Table 1). The di-
vision into 2 study sets was based on sampling date.
Fecal DNA was extracted using mechanical lysis (Fastprep
FP120; ThermoSavant, Illkirch, France) followed by phenol/
chloroform-based extraction as previously described.24 Biopsy
specimens from the sigmoid colon were obtained from 59
subjects (39 IBS and 20 healthy subjects). The biopsy speci-
mens were taken 25–35 cm proximal of the anus during an
unprepared sigmoidoscopy. Once collected, biopsy specimens
were placed immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80�C
until further analysis. Mucosal adherent microbiota DNA was
isolated using an adapted protocol based on Godon et al25 (see
the Supplementary Material for more detail). Routine histopa-
thology of biopsy specimens confirmed the absence of active
inflammation.
Microbial Composition Assessment
Hypervariable 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) regions (V5–V6)
were amplified using primers 5’-AGGATTAGATACCCTGGTA-3’
and 5’-CRRCACGAGCTGACGAC-3’. Sequencing was performed by
DNA Vision SA (Charleroi, Belgium) on a 454 Life Sciences
Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)
using titanium chemistry. Raw reads quality filtering and trim-
ming, operational taxonomic units (OTU) clustering, and taxo-
nomic assignment all were performed using the LotuS v1.32
pipeline26 (see the Supplementary Material for more detail).
Detection of Methanobacteriales by
Quantitative PCR
Fecal extracted DNA were subjected to quantitative PCR
using primers targeting the Methanobacteriales order Mtb857F
(5’-CGWAGGGAAGCTGTTAAGT-3’)
and
Mtb1196R
(5’-
TACCGTCGTCCACTCCTT-3’), as has been described previ-
ously.27 PCR results then were translated as the presence or
absence of dominant Methanobacteriales in fecal samples using
106 rRNA genes copies per gram of wet fecal content as the
threshold, as defined by the lowest detected value in the
standard curve.

 Numerical Ecology and Statistical Analysis
a-Diversity (diversity within samples) was assessed using
the number of observed OTUs rarefied at the same sequencing
depth (3500 sequences per sample in this study) using the
vegan R package.28 b-Diversity (diversity between samples)
was assessed by square-root Jensen–Shannon divergence met-
rics,29 referred to as the Jensen–Shannon distance (JSD) in this
article, as well as the Bray–Curtis distance. Enterotype strati-
fication was identified in fecal samples (1 sample per individ-
ual) using previously described methods with the Dirichlet
multinomial mixture model.30
A machine learning procedure to identify a microbial signa-
ture for IBS severity was implemented using L1 regularized
logistic regression31 (least absolute shrinkage and selection
operator [LASSO]) using the LIBLINEAR library32 validated
through
a
10-fold
independent
cross-validation.
Features
selection and data transformation was processed as previously
described.33 The performance of prediction models was assessed
for its discriminative ability using the area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUROC) on exploratory and vali-
dation data sets. OTUs selected by machine learning were char-
acterized further by their prevalence in healthy subjects and in
patients with severe IBS (IBS-SSS > 300), and by their phyloge-
netic specificity (see Supplementary Material for more detail).
Co-inertia analysis was used to identify the relationship
between the fecal and biopsy microbiota data sets, as well as
the relationship between a microbial signature for IBS severity
and the clinical data, using the ade4 R package.34 The overall
similarity between data sets then was measured by the
regression vector (RV) coefficient.34 The relationship between
variables
was
assessed
using
nonparametric
tests
(the
Wilcoxon test and Spearman correlation test) for continuous
variables (eg, bacterial relative abundance, microbiota a-and
b-diversity, IBS-SSS, HAD, age, body mass index [BMI], exhaled
gas, and stool frequency and consistency), and the chi-squared
test for categoric variables (eg, enterotypes, IBS subtypes, and
the presence or absence of methanogens). A Monte Carlo per-
mutation test (99 permutations) was used to assess the
robustness of the RV coefficient. The statistical approaches (eg,
co-inertia and Monte-Carlo) applied to microbiota analysis have
been thoroughly described previously.35 In case of multiple
testing, all P values were adjusted by Benjamini–Hochberg
false-discovery rate correction.36 All statistical analyses were
performed
with
R

Results
Clinical Characteristics of IBS Patients and
Healthy Subjects
The study cohort was divided into 2 study sets based on
sampling date. The first set, the exploratory set (149 subjects:
110 IBS and 39 healthy), were recruited between April 2010
and May 2012. The second study set, the validation set (46
subjects: 29 IBS and 17 healthy), were recruited between
June 2012 and November 2013. Detailed clinical and de-
mographic characteristics for the exploratory and validation
sets are summarized in Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1.
There were no differences between IBS patients or healthy
subjects from the 2 study sets regarding sex, age, BMI, or
clinical parameters after Benjamini Hochberg correction for
test multiplicity. Apart from expected differences between
IBS subtypes in stool characteristics and OATT, gender dif-
ferences also were seen (more women in the IBS-C group,

 Pearson chi-squared test, P < .05), but otherwise other clin-
ical and demographic data were similar in IBS subtypes.
Regarding IBS subtype distribution, no differences were
observed, neither between severe and other IBS, nor between
the exploratory and validation sets (Supplementary Table 2).
Fecal and Mucosal Microbiota Are Structurally
Distinct but Highly Correlated
Paired mucosal and fecal microbiota samples were
analyzed from 59 study subjects in the exploratory set
(Supplementary Table 1). Paired comparisons of 16S rRNA
gene sequencing analysis showed that fecal microbiota
harbored more Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, whereas
mucosal microbiota was enriched in Bacteroidetes and Pro-
teobacteria (P < .05) (Figure 1A). a-Diversity of mucosal
adherent microbiota, as measured by the number of OTUs,
was significantly lower than that of fecal microbiota (P < .05)
(Figure 1B). By using a co-inertia approach based on JSD
metrics, mucosal microbiota was associated significantly
with the fecal microbiota (RV, 0.71; P < .001), as shown in
Figure 1C and D.
Microbiota Diversity in Fecal and Biopsy Samples
Microbiota diversity in both fecal and biopsy samples was
analyzed in the exploratory set using classic ecologic
descriptive approaches including a�diversity (richness as
measured by number of OTUs, 97% identity) and b�diversity
metrics (JSD and Bray–Curtis distance using bacterial genus
relative abundance). Neither microbiota richness nor micro-
biota variability differed between groups (healthy subjects,
IBS patients, IBS Rome III subtypes, or IBS severity) in the
exploratory set. This was true for both fecal and biopsy
samples (Supplementary Figure 2).
Enterotype Stratification in Healthy Subjects and
IBS Patients
Microbiota clustering was performed on 232 fecal sam-
ples from IBS patients (including 2 samples for most patients)
and healthy subjects in the exploratory set (Supplementary
Table 1) using the Dirichlet multinomial mixture model.
Microbiota separated optimally into 3 distinct microbiota
communities as assessed by Bayesian information criterion
and the Laplace parameter (Supplementary Figure 3A and B).
The 3 identified microbiota communities were similar to the
previously described gut microbial enterotypes.29 One
enterotype was enriched in Bacteroides (16% of samples), 1
was enriched in Prevotella (14% of samples), and 1 was
enriched in Clostridiales (70% of samples) (Figure 2A and
Supplementary Figure 3C). Notably, distribution of enter-
otypes correlated with microbial richness, with Bacteroides-
enterotyped subjects harboring the lowest richness, as
compared with Prevotella- and Clostridiales-enterotyped
subjects (P < .05) (Figure 2B).
Next, we analyzed enterotype distribution and association
with clinical parameters. After correcting for multiple

tween enterotypes and clinical parameters including age,
BMI, HAD anxiety, HAD depression, exhaled H2 and CH4, or
bowel

(stool

and

(Supplementary Figure 4A). However, enterotype distribu-
tion was associated with OATT in both healthy subjects and
IBS patients (Supplementary Figure 4A). Subjects with the
Clostridiales enterotype showed longer transit times than
subjects with Prevotella and Bacteroides enterotypes (P <
.05). Furthermore, the Prevotella enterotype was significantly
more prevalent in men (P < .05) (Supplementary Figure 4B).
Enterotype distribution differed between healthy subjects
and IBS patients, with the enterotype Bacteroides being more
frequent in IBS subjects and the Prevotella enterotype was
more common in healthy subjects (Supplementary Figure 4C)
(P < .05). Enterotype distribution also was associated with
bowel habits (Pearson chi-squared test, P < .05). IBS-D and
IBS-M patients had a higher prevalence of Bacteroides
enterotype compared with IBS-C patients and healthy
subjects (Figure 2C). Regarding IBS symptom severity
(IBS-SSS), the prevalence of the Prevotella enterotype grad-
ually decreased as symptom severity increased (P < .05)
(Figure 2D).
Prevalence of Methanogens in Healthy Subjects
and IBS Patients
In the exploratory set, microbiota enterotyping was
complemented by the detection of fecal methanogens by
quantitative
PCR,
with
specific
emphasis
on
Meth-
anobacteriales, which was detected in 33% of fecal samples,
with a similar prevalence in healthy subjects and IBS pa-
tients (Supplementary Figure 5). A significant association
was observed between exhaled CH4 and the presence of
fecal methanogens (P < .05) (Supplementary Figure 5A).
Detection of methanogens was dependent on enterotypes
because 90% of individuals who harbored Methanobacter-
iales belonged to the Clostridiales-enriched enterotype and

 less than 5% of Bacteroides-enriched enterotypes had

The presence of methanogens was associated with IBS
subtype distribution (P < .05). The proportion of IBS-D
patients with undetectable Methanobacteriales was higher
(w40%) than in IBS-C patients (w10%) (Supplementary
Figure 5C). The IBS-SSS was not associated with the pres-
ence of Methanobacteriales (P > .05) (Supplementary
Figure 5D). IBS-D patients exhaled less CH4 than IBS-M
patients (Supplementary Figure 5E), and heathy subjects
exhaled less CH4 than IBS patients with mild symptoms
(Supplementary Figure 5F).
Identification of a Microbial Signature for IBS
Symptom Severity
We
further
explored
the
association
between
IBS
symptom
severity
and
fecal
microbiota
composition.
Compared with mild and moderate IBS subjects, a signifi-
cantly higher number of OTUs (n ¼ 100) could discriminate
IBS subjects with severe symptoms from healthy subjects
(Figure 3A). By using the bootstrapping method, we
observed that the analysis was sensitive to randomness.
When comparing 2 batches of 30 individuals randomly
selected from the exploratory set, up to 50 bacterial OTUs
could differ between the 2 batches driven by chance. In
other words, compared with the total number of differential
OTUs, half of the significant observations between tested
groups could be detected by chance (Figure 3A). To over-
come the issues related to randomness, we explored fecal
microbiota in association with IBS symptom severity using
an additional and more robust statistical approach, based on
machine learning (LASSO). This allowed us to decrease the
OTU complexity by combining them into a consensus mi-
crobial signature from an ensemble of classifiers that
discriminated patients with severe IBS from patients with
moderate or mild IBS and healthy subjects. Based on IBS
symptom severity, 90 of 2911 total OTUs were selected by
the machine learning procedure. The predictive power of
this signature was quantified by AUROC analyses. Cross-
validation of the microbial signature for IBS severity ob-
tained with the exploratory set was performed against the
fecal samples validation set (area under the curve [AUC],
0.74). The signature based on fecal samples in the explor-
atory set also was efficient to classify mucosal samples
according to IBS severity (AUC, 0.82) (Figure 3B). Next, we
assessed the OTU microbial signature for IBS severity
obtained from the exploratory set in the validation set
(n ¼ 46 individuals), which included 13 severe IBS patients
(Figure 3B). In the validation set, an AUC of 0.64 was ob-
tained, suggesting that the OTUs identified as a microbial
signature for IBS severity were robust.
Taxonomic Characterization of the Gut Microbial
Signature for IBS Severity
To further characterize the gut microbial signature for
IBS severity, we analyzed the taxonomy of the 90 OTUs
selected by the machine learning procedure (Figure 4). To
assess the phylogenetic distribution of the microbial
signature for IBS severity, we performed a principal coor-
dinate analysis of the OTUs originating from the whole fecal
microbiota data set (n ¼ 2911 OTUs), using nucleotide
identity between their respective representative sequences
(Figure 4A). Notably, there were no phylogenetic lineage
specific for the microbial signature for IBS severity, but
instead an overlapping taxonomy between the microbial
signature for IBS severity and the whole microbiota data
set, suggesting that those 90 OTUs associated with IBS
severity are as diverse taxonomically as the OTUs from the
whole microbiota data set. When examining only the OTUs

(mild, moderate, and severe IBS, and healthy controls, respectively) were taken randomly and each OTU was tested using a
Wilcoxon test. This procedure was repeated 1000 times. The number of significant OTUs for each comparison is reported with
boxplot. Dashed red line illustrates the random expectation defined as the 95th percentile of random comparison. (B) AUC of 1000

 extracted from the microbial signature for IBS severity, the
dominant families of the gut microbiota were represented
(ie, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroidaceae),
but a large proportion (>25%) was not assigned at the
family level (Figure 4B). Then, the 90 IBS severity
discriminating OTUs were ranked according to their
average weight in the model (Supplementary Table 3). In
this model, OTUs with a negative weight had a positive
association with IBS severity. The proportion of OTUs that
showed positive or negative weight in the model was
similar

(Pearson chi-squared test, P < .05). In the Firmicutes
phylum, including known and dominant genera such as
Faecalibacterium, Oscillibacter, Blautia, and Coprococcus,
OTUs were associated positively with IBS of moderate
severity or healthy status. Finally, we compared the prev-
alence of the 90 OTUs from the signature for IBS severity
between healthy subjects and patients with severe IBS. The
prevalence of OTUs that were associated positively to
healthy status (ie, positive weight in the model signature)
was significantly higher in the microbiota of healthy
subjects compared with severe IBS patients (Wilcoxon test,
P < .05) (Figure 4D).

 Gut Microbial Signature for IBS Severity
and Association With Clinical and
Microbial Parameters
To evaluate the robustness of the microbial signature for
IBS severity in relationship to other clinical parameters, we
investigated the relative abundance of OTUs along with
clinical data in a co-inertia analysis as shown in Figure 5.
Clinical parameters included age, BMI, HAD anxiety, HAD
depression, exhaled CH4 and H2, IBS subtypes, stool con-
sistency (Bristol Stool Form) and frequency, and OATT. The
first 2 co-inertia components explained more than 50% of
co-variation between the IBS severity signature microbial
OTUs and clinical parameters.
The IBS-SSS was confirmed to be the most important fac-
tor contributing to variation in the full data set along the first
co-inertia component (PC1) (Figure 5A). In addition, OTUs
that had a positive weight in the microbial signature were
more prevalent in microbiota of healthy subjects and were
associated positively with PC1 (Figure 5B). This suggests that
OTUs selected by the machine learning procedure allowed
ranking patients along the IBS severity scale (Figure 5C).
As expected, anxiety and depression were associated posi-
tivelywithIBSseverityandthisassociationwasreflectedonthe
gut microbial signature (Spearman rho correlation with PC1 of
-0.4 and -0.32, respectively, P < .05) (Supplementary Table 4).
In addition, exhaled CH4 concentration (Figure 5A and D) was
associated with both components PC1 (rho ¼ 0.36; P < .05) and
PC2 (rho ¼ 0.44; P < .05). IBS-C and exhaled CH4 concentra-
tions were the most important factors explaining the variation
along the second co-inertia component PC2 (Figure 5A and E).
This suggests that exhaled CH4 was associated primarily with
slower transit and secondly with less severe symptoms. PC2
was to a lesser extent associated with OATT (rho ¼ 0.54; P <
.05) and stool consistency (rho ¼ -0.36; P < .05). This suggests
that the machine learning procedure, which originally was set
up to discriminate severe IBS from mild, moderate IBS and
healthy subjects, selected additional OTUs to identify IBS-C
patients with high concentrations of exhaled CH4. However,
the microbial signature for IBS severity was poorly explained
by age, BMI, and H2 concentrations as shown in Figure 5A.
We then tested a posteriori these 2 first co-inertia com-
ponents against microbiota parameters. These included mi-
crobial richness, absence or presence of Methanobacteriales,
andenterotypestratification (Figure5C, D, and F, respectively),
which altogether were associated significantly with the first
component PC1 (Wilcoxon test, P < .05). When plotting
IBS-SSS and microbial richness, the gut microbial signature for
IBS severity was linked with lower microbial richness
(Figure 5C), lower levels of exhaled CH4 (Figure 5D), and
Bacteroides-enriched enterotype (Figure 5F). This suggests
that selected OTUs from the machine learning procedure
discriminated patients along a symptom severity gradient
together with enterotype stratification.
Gut Microbial Signature for IBS Severity and
Association With Diet and Use of Medications
A total of 111 individuals (89 IBS and 22 healthy) fol-
lowed a 4-day food diary to assess nutrient intake. Average
daily intakes were calculated for energy, proportion of fat,
carbohydrates, fiber, protein, and total intake of FODMAPs
(Supplementary Table 5). By using a co-inertia analysis
followed
by
a
Monte
Carlo
test
(see
Supplementary
Material), the overall association between dietary data and
the gut microbial signature for IBS severity was tested, and
no significant association could be detected (RV, 0.10;
P > .05), indicating that the microbial signature for IBS
severity is independent of overall nutrient intake, as well as
intake of FODMAPs. Similar analyses regarding the influence
of medications (Supplementary Table 6), including laxatives
or bulking agents, acid suppressants (mainly proton pump
inhibitors), antidiarrheals, and antidepressants drugs, did
not show any significant associations with the microbial
signature for IBS severity.
Discussion
In this study we characterized both fecal and mucosal
microbiota in a large cohort of IBS patients and healthy
subjects. By using a machine learning approach, we show
that IBS symptom severity is associated with a distinct fecal
microbiota signature that also is detected in the intestinal
mucosa. This signature also is associated with microbial
richness, exhaled CH4, presence of Methanobacteriales, and
enterotype stratification (assessed by using the Dirichlet
multinomial mixture model), as well as stool consistency
and transit time. Lower microbial richness and exhaled CH4,
as well as a reduced prevalence of Methanobacteriales and
Prevotella enterotype, were observed in subjects with se-
vere IBS. Interestingly, the prevalence of Prevotella enter-
otype decreased as the severity of symptoms increased, in
parallel to the increased prevalence of Bacteroides enter-
otype. A graphic summary of the main findings is shown in
Figure 6.
We explored the data using a combination of approaches
that are well described for microbiota analysis (ie, univariate
and multivariate analyses). However, when using these
classic ecologic approaches, no clear differences were
observed between healthy subjects and IBS patients, or
between IBS subtypes as defined by the Rome III criteria. No
differences were detected in fecal microbiota between IBS
and healthy subjects regarding a-diversity (microbial rich-
ness), or b-diversity (pairwise JSD distance comparisons) at
any taxonomy level (from phyla to species). Similar findings
were observed for mucosal microbiota. A trend toward a
reduction in the richness of fecal microbiota was observed in
IBS subjects. Rajili�
c-Stojanovi�
c et al8 did not report a change
in a-diversity, but an almost 2-fold increase of the ratio of
major bacterial phyla Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes in 62 IBS
patients (Rome II criteria) compared with 46 healthy sub-
jects. In a previous study from our group, although no overall
differences in microbiota composition between 37 IBS (Rome
II criteria) patients and 20 healthy subjects were observed,
nevertheless 2 specific IBS subclusters with altered fecal
microbiota composition were identified. Interestingly, the 2
IBS subclusters accounted for 60% of IBS patients in the
study, and harbored an increased Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes
ratio compared with that of healthy subjects and other IBS

 patients.9 Other studies, similar to ours, however, did not
report significant differences between IBS and healthy sub-
jects in either fecal or small intestinal microbiota, or reported
conflicting results.15,37 Recently, a larger cohort from Pozuelo
et al38 similar to our study, reported in contrary a trend
toward a higher abundance of Bacteroidetes in 113 IBS
(Rome III criteria) compared with 66 healthy subjects, as well
as a lower richness in IBS subjects, probably driven by the
high proportion of IBS-D subjects in that cohort. These dis-
crepancies could be owing to several factors including

 heterogeneity of IBS cohorts (ie, proportion of IBS subtypes,
with a majority of 1 subtype, and differences in symptom
severity), as well as the use of different methods (machine
learning vs descriptive statistics) and 16S rRNA gene variable
regions used to analyze microbiota (Supplementary Table 7
and references within), and also an absence of validation
cohorts. However, differences between IBS patients and
healthy subjects were observed in our study based on
enterotype distribution, with healthy subjects being more
likely to belong to the Prevotella enterotype than IBS patients,
with a concomitant increase in the prevalence of the Bacter-
oides enterotype in IBS.
Figure 6. Graphic summary of the methods and results of the study. An exploratory (n ¼ 149) and a validation set (n ¼ 46) of
IBS patients and healthy subjects were included in the study. DNA was extracted from fecal and sigmoid biopsy samples to
assess gut microbiota by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Methanobacteriales were detected by quantitative PCR in fecal
samples. Most of the IBS patients from the exploratory set were sampled twice. Subsequent analyses of 16S sequencing data
included various approaches. First, ecologic analysis included a- and b-diversity assessment and enterotype detection.
Second, the machine learning procedure was used to select gut microbiota OTUs and to train models based on IBS severity on
the exploratory set. The resulting microbial signature allowed classifying mucosal samples of the exploratory set, and the stool
samples of the validation set, based on IBS severity. Third, the microbial signature for IBS severity was taxonomically char-
acterized and evaluated against clinical parameters. The microbial signature for IBS severity was associated with low microbial
richness, low CH4 exhaled, Bacteroides enterotypes enriched, and absence of Methanobacteriales.

 We also explored paired mucosal and fecal microbiota
data. The distinction between fecal and mucosal colonic
microbiota in terms of composition already was detectable
at the phylum level, with increased proportions of Bacter-
oidetes and Proteobacteria in biopsy specimens, and a
higher abundance of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were
observed in fecal samples. Our data also are supported in
part by Rangel et al,16 who observed different microbiota
composition between mucosal and fecal samples in both
healthy subjects and IBS patients, although the microbial
diversity in biopsy specimens and fecal samples from their
study was lower among IBS patients. In our study, the dif-
ference in microbiota composition between fecal samples
and biopsy specimens was accompanied by lower richness
in biopsy specimens as compared with fecal samples in both
healthy subjects and IBS patients, which is consistent with
previous reports.39,40 Although microbiota from paired
mucosal and fecal
samples were
structurally distinct
and with different a-diversity, their respective microbial b-
diversity co-varied, which is consistent with the data ob-
tained from the rhesus macaque microbiota.41 A larger
number of biopsy samples would be needed to decipher
whether mucosal microbiota is associated more strongly
with IBS severity than fecal microbiota.
In this study, we complemented the microbiota compo-
sition analysis by quantification of microbial groups able to
produce CH4,42 so-called methanogens, which prevent H2
accumulation in the gut. Production of CH4 using H2 is
restricted to Archaea, with the order Methanobacteriales
containing Methanobrevibacter smithii and Methanosphaera
stadtmanae
as
the
dominant
methanogens
in
human
beings.42,43 Evidence has emerged suggesting that CH4 is
linked to constipation,44 and it has been reported that M
smithii is found more commonly in patients with IBS-C.45 In
our study, 33% of study subjects harbored detectable levels
of Methanobacteriales, with no difference between healthy
subjects and IBS patients. Interestingly, there was a signifi-
cant correlation between exhaled CH4 and the detection of
Methanobacteriales by quantitative PCR, which is in line with
previous findings.45 In our study, the presence of Meth-
anobacteriales differed according to IBS subtypes. IBS-D
patients
had
more
undetectable
Methanobacteriales
compared with the other IBS subtypes. Moreover, Meth-
anobacteriales detection was associated positively with mi-
crobial richness in the enterotype Clostridiales in our study,
which is in accordance with the study by Vandeputte et al.46
This enterotype also was associated with longer transit time,
which is consistent with another recent study.47
We explored the data using a robust statistical analysis
based on a machine learning algorithm because large mi-
crobial data sets generated from sequencing technologies
might generate overfitting and overestimation.48 Recently,
there has been a growing interest in the use of machine
learning techniques to detect microbiota signature in health
and diseases.33,49 In our study, the LASSO procedure iden-
tified 90 bacterial OTUs that could be used as a composite
gut microbial signature for IBS severity. The signature was
robust and it still remained valid after cross-validation and
testing in the validation cohort. The microbial signature was
enriched in taxonomically diverse phylotypes. At the family
level, a similar proportion of OTUs within Lachnospiraceae
and Ruminococcaceae were associated with health or IBS
severity. OTUs known to be associated with health were
more prevalent in healthy subjects than in severe IBS pa-
tients. These OTUs include Faecalibacterium, Oscillibacter,
Blautia, and Coprococcus species, which previously were
reported to belong to the healthy microbiota phylogenetic
core.50,51 The phylogenetic core may represent co-evolved
species within the gut microbiome that support essential
gut microbial functions.51 Finally, the microbial signature
for IBS severity was tested against clinical and microbial
parameters. IBS severity thus was confirmed to be the
strongest factor associated with the microbial signature
along with the presence of methanogens, exhaled CH4,
enterotype, and microbial richness. Overall, clinical param-
eters other than IBS severity were not associated strongly
with the microbial signature. Because recent studies re-
ported transit time as a strong confounding factor for
microbiota composition,46,47 it seems important to stress
that OATT and IBS subtypes were not confounding factors
for the microbial signature for IBS severity.
A limitation of the present study that could prevent
extrapolation of the results to the general IBS population was
that all patients were included at a secondary/tertiary
referral center. It is well known that IBS patients seen in
referral centers have more severe GI and psychological
symptoms, as well as a reduced quality of life, and therefore
do not reflect the general IBS population. Because it is well
recognized that diet and intake of medications are 2 factors
that shape gut microbiota,47,52 we further examined whether
the microbial signature for IBS severity was influenced by
these 2 factors. Our analysis on global intake of nutrients
(protein, carbohydrates, fat, and calorie intake), and intake of
FODMAPs did not support a relationship between these food
categories and our gut microbiota signature for IBS severity.
Regarding the intake of medications, although patients with
severe IBS, as expected, were more likely to be treated with
antidepressants than patients with milder forms of IBS, the
gut microbiota signature for IBS severity was neither asso-
ciated significantly with intake of antidepressants, nor with
intake of other groups of medications.
To conclude, by using a large cohort and classic ecologic
approaches, we could not observe differences between
healthy subjects and IBS patients. However, the machine
learning approach allowed identification of a gut microbial
signature for IBS severity, which also could be reproduced
in a validation cohort. Importantly, because of its relatively
low sensitivity, this microbiota signature cannot be used as
a clinical predictor of IBS severity, but as a way to explore
relevant features (ie, OTUs), which deserve to be explored in
future IBS microbiota studies.
Our study highlights the heterogeneity of IBS patients, and
the difficulty in stratifying patients based on a microbiota
profile when using only classic ecologic approaches. The use
of machine learning has allowed us to circumvent the issues
related to large microbial data sets and to better explore the
microbial data. We were able to identify several interesting
links between gut microbiota and the clinical profile.

Intestinal Microbiota and IBS Severity
123
CLINICAL AT
 Supplementary Materials and Methods
Questionnaires
Patients with IBS who were enrolled in the study
completed questionnaires to characterize their symptom
severity and bowel habits. The IBS-SSS was used to assess the
severity of IBS symptoms.1 This is a well-validated ques-
tionnaire that is based on 5 items: intensity and frequency of
abdominal pain, severity of abdominal distension, bowel
habits dissatisfaction, and interference with daily life. The
maximum score is 500 and patients can be categorized as
having mild (<175), moderate (175–300), or severe (>300)
IBS symptoms. General anxiety and depression were evalu-
ated by the HAD scale.2 This is a 14-item questionnaire used
to measure the severity of anxiety and depression on 2
subscales with 7 items each. Each item is scored between
0 and 3, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms
and with a total score range per subscale of 0–21.
The patients reported all bowel movements in a daily
diary for 2 weeks, based on the Bristol Stool Form scale.3 The
stool consistency was scored on a 7-point scale: type 1
(separate hard lumps similar to nuts, difficult to pass), type 2
(sausage shaped but lumpy), type 3 (similar to a sausage but
with cracks on the surface), type 4 (similar to a sausage or
snake, smooth and soft), type 5 (soft blobs with clear-cut
edges), type 6 (fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy
stool), and type 7 (watery, no solid pieces, entirely liquid).
Based on this information, the stool frequency (average
number of stools/day) and stool consistency (average stool
consistency/day) could be calculated. A total of 111 subjects
(89 IBS and 22 healthy) completed a food diary for 4 days (3
weekdays and 1 day during the weekend). The diary included
details regarding cooking methods, ingredients, brands of
foods (if appropriate), time points for meals, and quantity
consumed in grams or household measurements. Patients
were given written instructions to enable accurate comple-
tion of the food record. The subjects were instructed to
consume their usual diet. Different food items and beverages
were entered in DIETIST XP version 3.1 (Kostdata.se,
Stockholm, Sweden), which converts food items into nutri-
ents and energy amounts. Composite foods (eg, casseroles)
were split into ingredients (food items). DIETIST XP software
covers approximately 1600 foods and 52 nutrients. DIETIST
XP is designed to estimate macronutrients and micro-
nutrients and energy intake. From the food records, average
daily intakes were calculated for energy, proportion of fat,
carbohydrates, protein, and FODMAPs. All nutrients in the
software DIETIST XP are based on food composition data
from the National Food Administration in Sweden, except for
the FODMAPs, which were calculated using a new Swedish
database
for
content
of
lactose,
fructose,
galacto-
oligosaccharides, fructans, and polyols in foods used in
Swedish diets (Liljebo et al, unpublished data).
Oro-Anal Transit Time Measurement
For the OATT measurement, the participants ingested
10 radiopaque rings every morning for 5 days. On day 6,
they ingested 5 radiopaque rings at 8:00 AM and 5 radi-
opaque rings at 8:00 PM to better define participants with
accelerated transit. On the morning of day 7 the radi-
opaque rings still present in the bowel were counted at
arrival at the laboratory, using fluoroscopy (Exposcop
7000 Compact; Ziehm GmbH, Nüremberg, Germany). OATT
expressed in days was calculated by dividing the number
of retained radiopaque rings by the daily dose (ie, 10).4 All
medications with known effects on the GI tract (proton
pump inhibitors, laxatives, antidiarrheals, opioid analge-
sics, prokinetics, spasmolytics, antidepressants) were dis-
continued at least 48 hours before intake of the first
radiopaque rings.
Breath CH4 and H2 Measurements
This test was performed after an overnight fast (ie, not
after intake of any substrate), and after the subjects had
received thorough instructions to avoid a diet rich in fiber
and poorly absorbed carbohydrates the day before the test.
The amount of exhaled H2 and CH4 was measured in parts per
million in end-expiratory breath samples collected in a sys-
tem used for the sampling and storing of alveolar air
(GaSampler System; QuinTron Instrument Company, Mil-
waukee, WI) and analyzed immediately using a gas chro-
matograph (QuinTron Breath Tracker; QuinTron Instrument
Company).
Collected Data and Missing Values
A total of 196 subjects were included in this study.
Information about sex, age, and BMI were available for all
196 subjects, exhaled H2 and CH4 in the fasting state and
HAD in 185 subjects, Bristol stool form data in 166 subjects,
and OATT in 181 subjects. IBS severity and subtypes were
available in 133 of 139 IBS patients. Methanogen qPCR
detection was performed on 231 of 278 fecal samples.
Microbial DNA Extraction From
Biopsy Specimens
Once collected, biopsy specimens were placed immedi-
ately in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80�C until further
analysis. Mucosal adherent microbiota DNA was isolated
using the adapted protocol from Godon et al5 for low biomass
samples.
Each biopsy sample was transferred to a tube containing
250 mL guanidine thiocyanate, 40 mL N-lauroyl sarcosine
10%, and 500 mL N-lauroyl sarcosine 5%, and vortexed before
incubation at 70�C for 1 hour. A total of 200 mg of glass beads
(0.001 mm) were added, and each tube was mixed for 10
minutes with the Vibrobroyeur (Retsch 25/s; Newtown, PA).
Fifteen milligrams of polyvinylpolypyrrolidone was added to
the tubes that were centrifuged for 5 minutes (12,700 rpm;
4�C). The resulting supernatant then was transferred to a
2-mL sterile tube. The pellet was washed with 500 mL of 50
mmol/L Tris pH 8, 20 mmol/L EDTA pH 8, 100 mmol/L NaCl,
1% polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, and centrifuged for 5 minutes
(12,700 rpm; 4�C). This washing procedure was repeated
twice and the resulting supernatants were pooled.

 Nucleic acids were precipitated by adding 1 mL of
isopropanol in each tube. Samples were stored overnight at
4�C. After centrifugation for 1 hour (12,700 rpm; 4�C), pellets
were dissolved in 450 mL phosphate buffer (Na2HPO4, pH 8,
0.1 mol/L) and 50 mL potassium acetate (5 mol/L acetate, 3
mol/L potassium) for 90 minutes at 4�C and then centrifuged
(30 min; 12,700 rpm; 4�C). Supernatants were transferred in
a sterile tube with 2 mL RNase (10 mg/mL). Tubes were
incubated for 30 minutes at 37�C. A total of 50 mL of sodium
acetate and 1 mL of 100% ethanol was added and tubes were
mixed gently. After being stored overnight at -20�C, tubes
were centrifuged for 1 hour (12,700 rpm; 4�C). The resulting
pellet was washed with 1 mL of ethanol (70%) and centri-
fuged for 5 minutes (12,700 rpm). The supernatant was
discarded and the washing procedure was repeated once.
Once dried, up to 100 mL of 10 mmol/L Tris Cl pH 8, 1 mmol/L
EDTA pH 8 was added to each tube to dissolve the purified
DNA. DNA was stored at -20�C until further analysis.
Microbial Composition Assessment
Quality filtering was performed using SDM software.6
Reads were filtered further for minimal and maximal
length, any ambiguous nucleotides, barcode and primer er-
rors, and homopolymeric nucleotide runs. The default
criteria parameter adapted to the 454 sequencing platform
were provided by LotuS. High-quality sequence criterion
(read average quality, 27; minimal sequence length, 250; no
ambiguous
bases,
maximum
of
homopolymer,
8;
no
mismatch allowed in primers barcode and primers, windows
quality threshold average of 25 from quality window of 50
bases) was used to build OTUs. High-quality and midquality
sequences were mapped to count the occurrence of estab-
lished OTUs in a single sample. OTU clustering at 97%
identity was performed with UPARSE, which embedded
UCHIME as chimera reads filterer. Each representative OTU
sequence was aligned and taxonomically assigned using
Greengenes database34 (release version 13.8, August 2013)
and RDP II database35 (release version 11).
OTU Prevalence and Phylogenetic Assessment
The prevalence of each OTU from the gut microbiota
signature for IBS severity was estimated in both healthy
subjects and severe IBS patients, and was defined as the
proportion of subjects for whom a specific OTU was
detected. The prevalence of each OTU in severe IBS patients
then was subtracted from the prevalence of the same OTU
in healthy subjects. Hence, OTUs with a positive value were
enriched in healthy subjects, and OTUs with a negative
value were enriched in severe IBS patients. To assess the
phylogenetic relationship between OTUs, pairwise nucleo-
tide sequence identities were computed between OTU
representative sequences using the SeqinR R package.7 A
principal coordinate analysis then was performed to assess
the phylogenetic specificity of the signature.
Co-inertia Analysis and RV Coefficient
Co-inertia analysis is an ordination method for coupling
2 (or more) sets of parameters (eg, clinical parameters and
microbiota OTU proportion) by looking at their linear
combinations. Thus, co-inertia analysis enables the simul-
taneous ordination of several tables. Co-inertia analysis is
related to other multivariate analyses such as canonical
correlation analysis. In the case of co-inertia analysis, the
co-inertia (the sum of the square of covariance) between
the 2 sets is maximized and decomposed. Hence, the co-
inertia value is a global measure of the co-structure be-
tween the 2 data sets. Co-inertia is high when the 2 sets
vary together and low when they vary independently.8
Depending on the data set, co-inertia analysis is coupled
with principal component analysis or correspondence anal-
ysis. In this study, we used co-inertia analysis for 2 types of
data set coupling: (1) 2 independent principal coordinate
analyses were computed based on fecal and mucosal
microbiota composition using JSD distance metric and then
subjected to a co-inertia analysis (Figure 1); and (2) prin-
cipal component analysis were computed on microbiota
OTU signatures for IBS severity and successively coupled
with a principal component analysis computed from clinical
parameters (Figure 5), diet, and medication intake.
The overall relatedness of the 2 data sets was measured
by the RV coefficient.8 The RV coefficient is the coefficient of
correlation between 2 tables (eg, in this study, between the 2
fecal and mucosal microbiota JSD distance matrices). A Monte
Carlo test was used to test the robustness of the RV
coefficient.
Statistical Modeling By Machine Learning
We used a custom pipeline in R (R version 3.10) to extract
the most discriminative features from fecal microbiota OTU
composition to distinguish patients with severe IBS from the
mild or moderate IBS and heathy controls. Here, we used the
LASSO logistic regression classifier9 implemented in LIB-
LINEAR,10 similar to Zeller et al,11 because it generates a
parsimonious classification model that selects only a few
features out of a potentially very large set.
Briefly, our pipelines were as follows (see Zeller et al11
for more details).
1. Feature
transformation:
we
applied
a
log-
transformation and subsequently standardized fea-
tures (by centering to mean 0 and dividing by each
features’ SD to which we added the 10th percentile of
SDs across all features).
2. Partitioning
data
for
10-fold
stratified
cross-
validation (we resampled data set partitions 10
times to obtain more stable accuracy estimates).
3. Fitting a LASSO model on the training data of each
cross-validation fold: the LASSO hyperparameter was
optimized for each model in a nested 5-fold cross-
validation on the training subset using the area un-
der the precision–recall curve as model selection
criterion and also enforcing at least 5 nonzero
coefficients.
4. Application of the trained LASSO models to obtain the
corresponding
cross-validation
test
predictions.

 Because of the resampled cross-validation (and also
in external validation), there were several test pre-
dictions for each test examples. To obtain a single
prediction score per example, we averaged all test
predictions (from 10 or 100 models in cross-
validation or external validation, respectively).
5. Model evaluation using AUROC analysis: 10-fold
cross-validation repeated 10 times, we obtained the
mean test prediction scores, which we subjected to
model performance analysis (Figure 3).
6. Model interpretation and marker extraction: features
(bacterial OTUs) with potential association with IBS
severity were extracted as nonzero coefficients from
all 100 LASSO models (trained in 10 times resampled
10-fold cross-validation).
