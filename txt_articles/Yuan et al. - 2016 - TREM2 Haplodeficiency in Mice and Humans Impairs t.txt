In Brief
Yuan, Condello, et al. demonstrate that
haplodeficiency of the microglia-specific
gene TREM2 markedly impairs the ability
of microglia to compact and insulate
amyloid deposits. Loss of this
neuroprotective microglia function leads
to marked axonal dystrophy, potentially
contributing to the increased risk of
dementia for carriers of TREM2 loss-of-
function mutations.

SUMMARY
Haplodeficiency of the microglia gene TREM2 in-
creases risk for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
but the mechanisms remain uncertain. To investigate
this, we used high-resolution confocal and super-
resolution (STORM) microscopy in AD-like mice
and human AD tissue. We found that microglia pro-
cesses, rich in TREM2, tightly surround early amyloid
fibrils and plaques promoting their compaction and
insulation. In Trem2- or DAP12-haplodeficient mice
and in humans with R47H TREM2 mutations, micro-
glia had a markedly reduced ability to envelop amy-
loid deposits. This led to an increase in less compact
plaques with longer and branched amyloid fibrils
resulting in greater surface exposure to adjacent
neurites. This was associated with more severe
neuritic tau hyperphosphorylation and axonal dys-
trophy around amyloid deposits. Thus, TREM2 defi-
ciency may disrupt the formation of a neuropro-
tective microglia barrier that regulates amyloid
compaction and insulation. Pharmacological modu-
lation of this barrier could be a novel therapeutic
strategy for AD.
INTRODUCTION
Microglia are the resident immune cells in the CNS, where they
constantly survey their microenvironment and become activated
in various neurological disorders (Davalos et al., 2005; Hanisch
and Kettenmann, 2007). In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a striking
feature of microglia is their universal clustering around amy-
loid-b (Ab) deposits, one of the major pathological hallmarks of
this condition. It has traditionally been thought that activated mi-
croglia remove Ab deposits via phagocytosis (Lee and Landreth,
2010). However, multiple recent lines of evidence indicate that
microglia are ineffective at removing fibrillar Ab in vivo (Condello
et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2010; Stalder et al., 2001). At the same
time, given their ability to secrete cytokines and reactive oxygen
species, microglia have the potential to be neurotoxic (Block
et al., 2007). Thus, it remains unknown whether certain aspects
of microglial function play beneficial or detrimental roles that
could be important for disease pathogenesis.
TREM2 (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2)
gene is specifically expressed by microglia in the CNS (Schmid
et al., 2002). A loss-of-function R47H (rs75932628, Arginine-
47-Histidine) mutation in TREM2 constitutes one of the strongest
single allele genetic risk factors for AD (Guerreiro et al., 2013; Jin
et al., 2014; Jonsson et al., 2013; Korvatska et al., 2015; Ruiz
et al., 2014), providing the clearest link between microglia
dysfunction and AD pathogenesis. While loss of Trem2 in vitro
disrupts Ab phagocytosis by microglia (Kleinberger et al.,
2014), Trem2-haplodeficient AD-like mice have shown inconsis-
tent results with respect to the amounts of cerebral Ab deposi-
tion (Jay et al., 2015; Ulrich et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015).
Thus, it remains unclear to what extent Trem2 regulates micro-
glia phagocytosis in vivo, suggesting that the increased risk of
AD in Trem2 haplodeficiency may not be due to differences in
amyloid plaque load. Interestingly, most studies in Trem2-
deficient AD-like mice have shown reduced number of microglia
around amyloid plaques (Jay et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015).
However, it remains unknown how subtle changes in microglia
around plaques could profoundly increase the risk of AD.

 Furthermore, it remains unclear how these mouse studies corre-
late with the human pathology.
Recently, we identified a protective function of microglia,
whereby their processes tightly wrap around plaques and act
as a physical barrier that prevents the outward extension of am-
yloid fibrils (Condello et al., 2015). This barrier function promotes
formation of highly compact plaque microregions that have min-
imal affinity for soluble Ab42 (Figure S1). Conversely, areas not
covered by microglia processes display hotspots with very
high soluble Ab42 affinity, leading to markedly concentrated pro-
tofibrillar Ab plaque regions. These Ab hotspots are neurotoxic
given that adjacent axons develop a greater extent of dystrophy
compared to those next to non-hotspot regions covered by
microglia (Condello et al., 2015). Despite these intriguing obser-
vations in mice, the importance of microglia in the pathogen-
esis of AD and more specifically the relevance of this newly
discovered microglial barrier function in humans has not been
demonstrated.
We thus hypothesized that disruption of the microglia barrier
function is a cellular mechanism underlying association be-
tween loss-of-function TREM2 mutations and increased risk
of AD. To test this, we used quantitative high-resolution
confocal microscopy and super-resolution Stochastic Optical
Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) in both human brains
of patients with R47H TREM2 mutations and in AD-like mice
lacking either Trem2 or its adaptor protein DNAX-binding
protein of 12 kDa (DAP12). This revealed unprecedented struc-
tural detail of the landscape of amyloid fibrils, axonal dystro-
phy, and microglia heterogeneity around plaques in TREM2
haplodeficiency.
Our data in mice and humans indicate that microglia pro-
cesses closely interact with individual amyloid fibrils in early
non-compact filamentous plaques and later form specialized
protrusions rich in TREM2 and DAP12 that tightly wrap around
the surface of compact plaques. We then demonstrate in both
TREM2 and DAP12 haplodeficiency a striking microglia pheno-
type in which these cells fail to polarize and engage nascent am-
yloid fibrils and mature compact plaques. However, this was not
associated with differences in amyloid phagocytosis or plaque
numbers. Instead, we observed a marked reduction in amyloid
plaque compaction and a subsequent increase in plaque surface
area contacting neuropil, which was associated with a significant
increase in the degree of axonal dystrophy. A strikingly similar
phenotype was also observed in human TREM2 R47H mutants,
demonstrating that this neuroprotective microglia barrier is
conserved in humans. Our data indicate that TREM2 deficiency
disrupts this specialized barrier function and may thus constitute
a previously unknown cellular mechanism linking TREM2 R47H
variant with increased risk of dementia. Future studies may
determine whether similar mechanisms play a role in the patho-
genesis of late-onset AD associated with other microglia-related
genetic risk alleles.
RESULTS
Microglia Processes Contacting Plaques Are Highly
Enriched with Trem2
We first examined the expression pattern of Trem2 in the brains
of three transgenic AD mouse models. Building upon previous
reports (Frank et al., 2008; Lue et al., 2015; Matarin et al.,
2015),
high-resolution
confocal
microscopy
revealed
that
Trem2 is enriched within plaque-associated microglia, but not
in microglia away from plaques or other neural cells (Figure S2).
Interestingly, we found that Trem2 expression was exceptionally
high at the leading edges of microglia processes directly con-
tacting amyloid plaques (Figures 1A–1C). We also detected
polarized expression of its signaling adaptor protein DAP12 (Fig-
ure 1D), and a marker of phosphorylated tyrosine (Figure 1E)
consistent with downstream kinase-mediated signal transduc-
tion (Colonna, 2003). Similar to mice, in postmortem human
brain, we found enhanced DAP12 expression specifically polar-
ized to microglia processes contacting amyloid plaques (Fig-
ure 1F and Table S1). The robust enrichment of Trem2, DAP12,
and a marker of downstream tyrosine phosphorylation suggests
that these signaling proteins could play a key role in the envelop-
ment of the plaque surface by microglia processes and the
establishment of the microglia barrier (Figure 1G).
Trem2 Haplodeficiency Abolishes the Microglia Barrier
but Does Not Impair Ab Phagocytosis
We next examined structural and functional features of microglia
in AD-like transgenic mice carrying different copy numbers of the
Trem2 or DAP12 genes (Figures 2, S2, and S4). High-resolution
confocal microscopy revealed that Trem2 or DAP12 deletion
markedly reduced the degree of plaque surface coverage by
microglia processes (Figures 2A–2D). The dramatic change of
plaque coverage in Trem2 and DAP12 deficiency cannot be ex-
plained alone by the modest �20% reduction in the number of
plaque-associated microglia (Figures S3 and S4). Instead, it ap-
pears that microglia in Trem2 or DAP12 deficiency have an
impairment in the ability to polarize their processes toward the
plaque surface and thus are unable to create an effective barrier
around them (Figures 2A–2D). Interestingly, in Trem2 deficiency,
microglia processes contacting plaques did not show enrich-
ment of phosphorylated tyrosine (Figure S3), a marker of down-
stream tyrosine kinase activation that is potentially necessary for
triggering actin reorganization during process polarization (Peng
et al., 2010). Indeed, contrary to the robust microglia processes
seen in wild-type mice (Figure 2E), processes contacting pla-
ques in either Trem2- or DAP12-deficient mice displayed char-
acteristic dysmorphic features with fine processes and terminal
loops that failed to closely track the boundaries of the plaque
(Figure 2F). Thus, Trem2 likely plays a critical role in signaling
microglia process specialization underlying the formation of the
microglia barrier around plaques.

 To assess whether Trem2 deficiency also affected Ab fibril
engulfment by microglia, we performed immunohistochemistry
and quantitative confocal image analysis to measure the Ab
content within CD68-immunolabeled microglial phagosomes, a
correlate of Ab phagocytosis efficiency. While in Trem2�/�
mice, there was a significant reduction in Ab phagocytosis, we
were surprised to see that in Trem2+/� mice, a more relevant
model of human TREM2 haplodeficiency leading to AD, there
was no significant difference in either the number of phago-
somes or amount of Ab within phagosomes (Figures 2G and
2H). This suggests that a defect in microglia phagocytosis of
Ab is not the main cause of neuropathology in Trem2 deficiency.
Instead it suggests that inability of microglia processes to
polarize and establish an effective barrier may be a neuropatho-
logical mechanism in TREM2 R47H variant carriers.
Trem2 Haplodeficiency Decreases Amyloid Plaque
Compaction and Increases Total Fibril Surface Area
We next asked how deficiency in the microglia barrier may
impact the structural organization of individual plaques. Quanti-
tative confocal analyses of individual plaques labeled by the b
sheet binding dye thioflavin S, in Trem2- and DAP12-deficient
mice, showed a reduction in the fluorescence and a diffuse pla-
que morphology with amyloid fibrils projecting outward radially
(Figures 3A–3C). To directly observe Ab fibrils, we next per-
formed super-resolution nanoscopy using stochastic optical
reconstruction microscopy (STORM) in brain slices fluorescently
immunolabeled with an N terminus anti-Ab antibody. While
plaques from Trem2+/+ mice exhibited circumscribed borders,
in Trem2+/� and Trem2�/� mice, plaques displayed spike-like
fibrils extending radially (Figure 3D). We then defined three
different plaque regions based on Ab fibril organization: (1)
diffuse region; (2) mesh-like region (likely formed by interweaving
of individual Ab fibrils); and (3) compact region (where densely
packed fibrils limit antibody penetration (Figures 3E and S5).
Trem2 deficiency markedly increased the proportion of diffuse
fibrils and decreased the proportion of mesh-like and compact
fibrils (Figure 3F). Furthermore, loss of Trem2 increased the
average length of diffuse fibrils radiating outward from the
mesh-like compact core (Figures 3G and 3H) (average 231 nm
in Trem2+/+, 396 nm in Trem2+/�, and 442 nm in Trem2�/�).
This suggests that the microglia barrier prevents the radial exten-
sion of b-amyloid fibrils, promoting their intermingling and forma-
tion of mesh-like structures with various degrees of compaction.
The longer amyloid fibers, coupled with their increased branch-
ing at the nano scale (Figure 4G), lead to a marked increase
in fibril surface area in Trem2 deficiency (see Supplemental
Information).
Microglia Processes Envelop Individual Fibrils in Early
Filamentous Plaques and Promote Their Compaction
To explore the role of microglia and TREM2 deficiency in the
earliest stages of amyloid deposition in mice, we obtained
high-resolution confocal images of clusters of thioflavin S-posi-
tive fibrils that lacked a dense core, which we termed filamen-
tous plaques (Figure 4A). Interestingly, we observed that these
plaques were highly intermingled with microglia processes (Fig-
ure 4A). Processes that directly contacted thioflavin S-positive
amyloid filaments were highly enriched in Trem2 (Figure 4B).
These processes appeared to closely wrap around individual
amyloid filaments as evidenced by the fact that the mem-
brane-bound Trem2 was highly colocalized with the filaments,
while the parent microglia branches filled with cytoplasmic
Iba1 were immediately adjacent (Figure 4C). We also observed
instances in which more mesh-like clusters of fibrils were fully
wrapped by fine Trem2-positive microglia processes that ap-
peared to cap individual fibril endings. (Figure 4D). This suggests
that these early interactions between microglia processes and
amyloid filaments could be of importance in determining the
degree of fibril compaction.
To explore this possibility, we examined the nanostructures
within diffuse fibrils revealed by super-resolution STORM imag-
ing. Within individual plaques, we observed fibrils with variable
widths ranging from 30 nm (about the resolution limit of our
STORM imaging) to 160 nm (Figures 4E and 4F). Consistent
with atomic-force microscopy data in vitro (Stine et al., 1996),
this suggests that Ab fibrils coil together to form bundle-like
structures of different widths in vivo. Interestingly, Trem2 defi-
ciency led to an increased proportion of thin fibril bundles
(�40 nm) and decreased proportion of thicker ones (average
68 nm in Trem2+/+, 57 nm in Trem2+/�, and 48 nm in Trem2�/�)
(Figure 4G). Furthermore, we observed branched structures ex-
tending orthogonally from the main Ab fibril bundle (Figure 4H),
which were markedly increased in plaques from Trem2-deficient
mice (Figure 4I). Together, the increased numbers of diffuse thin
fibers projecting outward for greater lengths and the increased

 orthogonal branches, implies that the surface-to-volume ratio of
amyloid fibers in Trem2-deficient mice is significantly greater
than in wild-type mice (we estimate an �300%–400% increase;
see Supplemental Information). This phenomenon would be
predicted to dramatically increase the contact area between
amyloid fibrils and the adjacent exposed cellular structures.
Importantly, while the total number of amyloid plaques was not
significantly different between Trem2-deficient and wild-type
mice (Figure 4J and Figure S3), we observed a significant in-
crease in the proportion of filamentous plaques in both Trem2+/�
and Trem2�/� mice (Figure 4J). The increase in filamentous pla-
ques coupled with the greater surface area of individual plaques
in Trem2+/� mice may lead to worsened neurotoxicity.
Decreased Amyloid Plaque Compaction in Trem2 or
DAP12 Deficiency Leads to Severe Axonal Dystrophy
To directly test the degree of neurotoxicity, we measured the vol-
ume of axonal dystrophy around individual amyloid plaques us-
ing immunohistochemistry for Lamp1, a lysosomal protein highly
enriched in dystrophic neurites (DN) that serves as a reliable
marker for quantitative DN measurements (Condello et al.,
2015, 2011; Gowrishankar et al., 2015). We classified plaques
by morphology and size with specific attention to early filamen-
tous plaques that were surprisingly associated with a massive
amount of dystrophic neurites (Figures 5A and 5B). We found
that Trem2 or DAP12+/� and DAP12�/� mice had a much greater
degree of axonal dystrophy than wild-type mice (Figures 5C and
5D). Interestingly, the main difference in dystrophy occurred in
non-compact filamentous and small compact plaques (up to
6 mm in diameter), suggesting that the protective effect of micro-
glia is most effective at early stages of plaque evolution. Given
that filamentous plaques are associated with a surprisingly large
degree of axonal dystrophy (Figure 5B), a shift of the distribution
toward filamentous plaques could have critical effects on the
overall degree of neural circuit disruption at early stages of
amyloid accumulation.
TREM2 R47H Mutations Disrupt the Microglia Barrier
Function in Late-Onset Human AD
To determine whether our findings in mice are relevant for human
AD pathogenesis, we next characterized the microglia and pla-
que phenotypes in postmortem human brains from sporadic
late onset AD cases and patients with R47H TREM2 variant.
Consistent with previous reports on late-onset AD, we observed
different types of plaque morphologies using anti-Ab immuno-
labeling (4G8) and thioflavin S (TS) staining (Figure 6A). We clas-
sified them into four categories: (1) diffuse plaques: diffuse 4G8+
fibrils lacking TS labeling; (2) filamentous plaques: 4G8+ halo
and filamentous TS labeling with no plaque core; (3) compact
plaques: 4G8+ halo and TS-labeled core; and (4) inert: TS-
labeled core with no 4G8 halo. Interestingly, microglia processes
did not display any polarization toward diffuse plaques but
showed enlarged processes that robustly intermingled with
both filamentous and compact plaques (Figures 6A and 6B).
Moreover, plaques that had a TS-labeled core with no 4G8
halo had very few microglia processes (Figure 6A) or dystrophic
neurites (Figure 7A) around them, which motivated us to call
them inert.
We next quantified the relative proportions of these plaque
categories in AD cases with and without the R47H TREM2 muta-
tion (Table S2). While we did not find a significant difference in
the overall microglia density or amyloid plaque burden between
genotypes (Figure S6), we did observe a robust increase in the
proportion of plaques with filamentous morphology (Figure 6C).
Remarkably, we observed a marked reduction in the number of
surrounding microglia in both filamentous and compact plaques
but we saw no significant microglia differences around diffuse
and inert plaques (Figure 6C) or in non-plaque regions (Figure S6).
Thus, the R47H mutation in humans leads to a specific defect of
microglia plaque engagement, which is strikingly similar to the
phenotype in Trem2- and DAP12-haplodeficient mice.
We then sought to determine how the observed decrease in
microglia numbers in R47H mutants impacts their capacity for
envelopment of individual filaments and plaque cores. Like
in mice, we observed that microglia processes infiltrated fila-
mentous plaques and had a tendency to surround individual fil-
aments (Figure 6D). In contrast, microglia around compact
plaques projected robust processes that closely enveloped the
plaque surface (Figure 6E). Interestingly, while microglia in
R47H mutants were able to send processes toward amyloid de-
posits, these appeared to be less robust and did not tightly
engage with individual fibrils or the plaque surface, leading to a
markedly diminished microglia coverage of amyloid aggregates
(Figures 6F–6H). Thus, TREM2 in humans likely regulates the

To determine the consequences of a deficient microglia barrier in
human AD with R47H TREM2 variant, we quantified the extent of
axonal dystrophy around individual plaques. Similar to mice, we
found that filamentous plaques lacking a core had a surprisingly
large number of dystrophic axons, as visualized by anti-APP
immunohistochemistry (Figure 7A). Interestingly, we found a dra-
matic increase in axonal dystrophy around both filamentous and
small compact plaques in R47H mutants compared to sporadic
non mutant AD cases (Figure 7B).
These dystrophic swellings were associated with marked cyto-
skeletalabnormalitiesasevidencedbytheextensiveneuriticlabel-

ADcases(Figure7D).Consistentwithourpreviousfindingsinmice

and

dystrophic neurites (Figures 7E and 7F),
suggesting that microglia normally exert
a protective insulating effect. This func-
tion is disrupted in R47H mutants as
demonstrated by a significantly reduced
degree and robustness of microglia pla-
que coverage associated with increased
neuritic abnormalities (Figure 7G).
DISCUSSION
Our study has uncovered previously un-
recognized microglia functions that may
participate in the pathogenesis of Alz-
heimer’s disease. We examined microglia-plaque interactions
in AD-like mice lacking Trem2 and DAP12 genes as well as in
postmortem brains from human AD patients with R47H muta-
tions. This enabled us to demonstrate that the tight envelopment
of fibrils and early-stage plaques by microglia processes
(‘‘microglia barrier’’) may play a role in inducing amyloid fibril
compaction and in reducing the surface area of potentially
neurotoxic fibrils exposed to surrounding neural structures (Fig-
ure S7). This potentially neuroprotective microglial function pro-
vides a novel cellular mechanism that may explain the increased
risk of Alzheimer’s disease with TREM2 genetic variants. It may
also provide important insights for the more common forms of
sporadic AD in which microglia senescence may drive similar
functional deficits in barrier formation (Condello et al., 2015).
Microglia function in AD remains controversial with some evi-
dence suggesting that they play a neurotoxic role by secreting
reactive oxygen species and cytokines (Block et al., 2007). In
advance neuropathological stages in mice, it has been shown
that eliminating microglia with CSF1R antagonists leads to
beneficial behavioral effects without changes in plaque numbers
(Dagher et al., 2015; Olmos-Alonso et al., 2016), consistent with
a toxic effect of microglia. In contrast, our results demonstrate a
potentially neuroprotective role of microglia in early stages of
plaque evolution, evidenced by the fact that areas covered by

 microglia processes develop fewer dystrophic neurites (Con-
dello et al., 2015) and by the finding that inability of microglia
to engage with plaques in R47H mutations is associated with
increased axonal dystrophy in humans. Furthermore, we find it
unlikely that microglia are actively involved in the formation or
pruning of dystrophic axons given that we never find their pro-
cesses directly surrounding or engulfing individual dystrophic
neurites (Figure S7) (Condello et al., 2015).
While the function of TREM2 in peripheral immune cell re-
sponses to pathogens has been extensively studied (Colonna,
2003), its role in AD remains poorly understood. Particularly,
the precise mechanisms underlying the association between
increased risk for AD and R47H TREM2 variant is not known.
The present study describes a novel role for Trem2 in the polar-
ization of microglial processes to envelope Ab deposits and
form a potentially neuroprotective barrier around them. Trem2
or DAP12 haplodeficiency in AD mice dramatically reduces pla-
que-associated microglia and disrupts the barrier formation.
Strikingly, in humans with R47H mutations, we observed a
nearly identical phenotype with a marked reduction in microglia
coverage of filamentous and small compact plaques that was
associated with more severe axonal dystrophy and hyper-phos-
phorylated tau in neurites.
Surprisingly, despite in vitro studies suggesting otherwise
(Kleinberger et al., 2014), we found that Ab phagocytosis by mi-
croglia in Trem2 haplodeficiency appears to remain normal
in vivo. This result suggests that rather than defective phagocy-
tosis, disruption of the microglia barrier could be a driving mech-
anism underlying increased risk for AD with single allele TREM2
mutations in humans. In contrast, when complete protein loss
occurred in Trem2�/� mice, we did observe a significant reduc-
tion in phagocytosis (Figures 2G and 2H). Defective phagocy-
tosis may be more relevant for explaining the much less common
Nasu-Hakola disease in which homozygous TREM2 mutations
cause a multi-organ condition associated with aggressive neuro-
degeneration but with very different neuropathological features
from AD (Paloneva et al., 2000).
Interestingly, while in Trem2- and DAP12-deficient mice as
well as R47H human mutants, microglia processes are unable
to form a robust barrier, they are still moderately polarized,
sending fine processes toward plaques (Figures 2A and 2B).
This suggests that separate molecular mechanisms (El Khoury
et al., 2003; Reed-Geaghan et al., 2009; Song et al., 2011)
mediate the chemotactic plaque attraction and projection of
microglia processes versus the formation of a tight and robust
envelopment of amyloid fibrils and deposits, which seems to
be highly dependent on Trem2 signaling. Given the recent find-
ings that Trem2 recognizes various types of lipids that are pre-
sent in amyloid plaques (Wang et al., 2015), we postulate that
the extent and types of lipids decorating the plaque surface
may regulate the microglia barrier through Trem2 signaling.
Consistent with this hypothesis, microglia around diffuse pla-
ques do not have a very activated and polarized morphology
(Figure 6), and spectrochemical analysis shows that diffuse pla-
ques do not have prominent lipid coating on their surface (Liao
et al., 2013; Rak et al., 2007). In contrast, as amyloid deposits
become filamentous and thioflavin S positive, which likely makes
them more lipophilic (Hilbich et al., 1992), they robustly attract
microglia processes, consistent with recent in vivo imaging
studies (Jung et al., 2015). It is therefore conceivable that condi-
tions affecting brain lipid metabolism, such as ApoE genetic
polymorphisms (Kim et al., 2009) or other mechanisms that alter
brain lipids (Dietschy and Turley, 2004), may affect amyloid pa-
thology by differentially modulating the formation of a microglia
barrier.
Loss of microglia barrier function leads to decreased Ab fibril
compaction as evidenced by our direct visualization of amyloid
plaque architecture with super-resolution STORM imaging (Fig-
ures 3 and 4) and the observed reduced thioflavin S fluorescence
intensity (Figure 3). STORM imaging revealed that plaques in
Trem2+/+ mice have a more compact organization with more
mesh-like structures and fibrils exhibiting greater widths and
shorter lengths than those in Trem2+/� and Trem2�/� mice. It
also showed that in Trem2 deficiency, fibrils have more nano-
scale orthogonal branches originating from the primary bundle
(Figures 3H and 3I). This is consistent with our previous observa-
tions that plaque regions not covered by microglia processes
have a markedly higher density of Ab protofibrils than covered
regions (Condello et al., 2015).
The absolute widths measured by STORM imaging likely do
not reflect the precise physical dimensions of single Ab fibrils,
given resolution limits (�30 nm) and the fact that antibody label-
ing itself changes the size of the imaged object. Interestingly,
however, the range of different widths that we observed demon-
strate three main size peaks (�40 nm, 80 nm, and 120 nm), sug-
gesting that STORM might be capable of differentiating unitary
Ab fibrils (with attached primary and secondary antibodies) coil-
ing together into larger bundles, consistent with in vitro studies
using atomic-force microscopy (Stine et al., 1996). Together,

 barrier are predicted to dramatically increase the surface area of
an individual plaque (Supplemental Information). Differences in
the degree of plaque compaction and fibril surface area may
be key factors determining the degree of plaque neurotoxicity.
Plaque regions not covered by microglia processes have lower
degree of amyloid compaction but greater affinity for soluble
Ab42 (Figure S1) and form hotspots of potentially neurotoxic pro-
tofibrillar Ab42 (Condello et al., 2015). Higher protofibrillar Ab42,
together with an overall increased contact area with surrounding
neurites in TREM2 deficiency, could synergistically contribute to
the increased plaque neurotoxicity that we observed.
One intriguing aspect of our data is that the total number
of thioflavin S compact plaques was modestly reduced in
Trem2-deficient
mice,
while
filamentous
amyloid
plaques
without a compact core increased significantly. This is consis-
tent with our model suggesting that the microglia barrier in-
creases plaque compaction and failure of the barrier, such as
in Trem2 deficiency, shifts the balance of plaques toward a
more diffuse phenotype without significantly altering total plaque
number. This finding, which is dependent on the type of labels
used for amyloid plaque quantification, may partly explain the
initial contradicting results reported with regards to plaque den-
sity in Trem2 deficiency (Jay et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015).
Our surprising observation that small filamentous plaques
cause a marked degree of axonal dystrophy around them in
both mice and humans (Figures 5B and 7A) is consistent with
the idea that less compact fibrils are more toxic than the
compact ones in the plaque core. Thus, the observed shift to-
ward a less compact plaque phenotype, coupled with the
greater numbers of filamentous plaques, could significantly in-
crease the overall degree of neural circuit damage despite a sta-
ble number of total plaques. Interestingly, our finding that diffuse
plaques do not cause axonal dystrophy suggest that the transi-
tion from diffuse to b sheet-rich filamentous conformation (evi-
denced by thioflavin S labeling) is the critical neurotoxic event
that leads to dystrophy consistent with recent in vivo imaging
data (Bittner et al., 2012). While filamentous plaques represent
a modest proportion of all plaques in AD-like mice (Figure 4J),
we found them to be more prevalent in human sporadic AD
brains (Figure 6C), which is likely due to the fact that plaque
growth is protracted over decades compared to months in
mice (Burgold et al., 2014; Condello et al., 2011). In addition, a
plaque phenotype we called inert, because its core was intensely
labeled by thioflavin S but was virtually devoid of dystrophic neu-
rites, suggests that highly compact plaques may be minimally
neurotoxic. These findings urge caution against using positron
emission tomography (PET) amyloid tracers with predominant
affinity to dense plaques and could partly explain the modest
predictive value of current PET tracers such as PIB (Kepe
et al., 2013) and the weak correlation between plaque load and
cognitive dysfunction in postmortem studies (Morris et al., 2014).
Our data show that loss of the microglia barrier in mice with
Trem2 deficiency has the greatest impact on axonal dystrophy
in filamentous and small compact plaques, but as plaques get
biggerthedifferenceinthedegreeofaxonaldystrophydiminishes
(Figure 5). A similar effect restricted to small plaques was previ-
ously observed when we enhanced the protective effects of the
microglia barrier by genetic deletion of the chemokine receptor
CX3CR1 in mice (Condello et al., 2015). We hypothesize that
the reason for this phenomenon is that in mice, the relatively rapid
plaque growth may overwhelm the overall capacity of microglia
neuroprotection and eventually most axons in their vicinity will
be affected, thus causing the degree of measurable axonal
dystrophy to plateau in large plaques. In human AD, we found
that the effect of R47H mutations on the degree of axonal dystro-
phy was present over a broader range of plaque sizes than in
mice (Figure 7). This is likely due to the fact that plaques are likely
to grow much slower in humans. Thus, it is conceivable that the
neuroprotective role of the microglia barrier in humans could be
effective over more protracted time intervals than in transgenic
mice.
While our study provides novel cellular phenomenology poten-
tially relevant for understanding microglia function in both mice
and humans, there remain uncertainties as to how the observed
defectivemicrogliabarrieracts,atamorefunctionallevel,tocause
pathological defects. Furthermore, while our findings demon-
strate marked neuritic changes around plaques in TREM2 defi-
ciency, the relative functional contribution of dystrophic neurites
compared to other pathologies such as synaptic loss, cell death
and neurofibrillary tangles is unclear. Thus, the overall relevance
of the microglia barrier function in the context of such complex
neurodegenerative disorder remains to be determined.
Nevertheless, our results suggest that boosting the microglia
barrier function or increasing plaque compactness by other
means could constitute a novel strategy for AD therapeutics.
Given the recent findings that APOE and CD33 (whose genetic
variants are common risk factors for AD) interact with the
TREM2 pathway (Atagi et al., 2015; Chan et al., 2015), our findings
could have implications for the more prevalent forms of AD in
which no mutations have been identified. Our current understand-
ing of the cellular, molecular, and biophysical mechanisms by
which microglia exert this potentially neuroprotective barrier
function is limited. However, future studies elucidating such
mechanisms may uncover targetable pathways that could spe-
cifically enhance the barrier function in microglia and reduce risk
for AD.

 University. 5XFAD mice (Oakley et al., 2006) were cross-bred with Trem2
knockout mice (Ulrich et al., 2014) as previously described (Wang et al.,
2015). APPPS1-21 (Radde et al., 2006) mice were cross-bred with DAP12
knockout mice to obtain DAP12-deficient mice (Bakker et al., 2000). Unless
specifically indicated, 4-month-old mice were used. CRND8 mice (courtesy
of Dr. David Westaway, University of Alberta) were also used.
Human Postmortem Brain Tissue
Formalin-fixed human postmortem brain tissue blocks were acquired from
various brain banks. Detailed demographic and clinical information can be
found in Table S2, including ten AD cases with the R47H mutation (Birdsill
et al., 2011; Korvatska et al., 2015) and nine cases with comparable AD pathol-
ogy but not carrying the mutation. Cases were matched for age, gender, and
ApoE genotype.
Immunohistochemistry
Brain slices were obtained from the mouse posterior somatosensory cortex
and human middle frontal gyrus. Mouse coronal sections were cut (40 mm
thick) with a cryostat and human tissue was sectioned with a vibratome. Pri-
mary antibodies incubation were 2 days at 4�(PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100
and 5% goat serum) and secondary antibodies for 6 hr, before mounting on
slides with PermaFluor (Thermo Scientific, TA-030-FM). Heat-induced sodium
citrate antigen retrieval was performed for TREM2, DAP12, and all human tis-
sue staining with the following protocol: tissue was boiled in 50 mM sodium cit-
rate with 0.05% tween-20 at 95� for 45 min and then washed with PBS. The
complete list of antibodies and reagents used in this study is included in the
Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Confocal Microscopy
A Leica SP5 confocal microscope was used to generate all images. Laser and
detector (the GaAsP hybrid detection system, photon counting mode) set-
tings were maintained constant. For all analyses, tiled imaging using a motor-
ized stage was used to image across one cerebral hemisphere in mice. A
3 mm2 human brain region per brain slice was imaged using a 633 oil immer-
sion objective (N.A. 1.4) at 1,024 3 10,24 pixel resolution, z-step size of
3 mm, and identity was blinded for analyses (Yuan and Grutzendler, 2016).
Images were processed with FIJI (ImageJ) software. A customized macro
was used to segment individual amyloid plaque. The number of plaques
analyzed ranged from 150 to 300 in each brain (see Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures).
STORM Imaging
Samples were mounted in a buffer consisting of 90% glycerol and 10% 103
PBS with an overall concentration of 10 mM cysteamine and 50 mM sodium
sulfite (J.T. Baker 3922-01). Images were recorded on a modified Nikon Ti-E
inverted microscope using a 603 1.49 N.A. oil-immersion objective using an
EMCCD camera (Andor IXon Ultra DU-897U-CS0-#BV). The objective was
mounted on a custom mount to suppress thermal and mechanical drift and
focusing was provided by a piezoelectric objective positioner (Physik Instru-
mente P-725.4CA). For illumination, a 642 nm solid-state laser (Omicron
Lux, 20 kW/cm2 at the sample) was used with a dichroic (Semrock, Di02-
R635-25x36) and a band-pass filter (Semrock, BLP01-647R-25) for separation
of excitation and emission. Field of view was selected using metal halide lamp
(Prior Lumen 200) illumination before switching to laser illumination and was
then imaged for approximately 20,000 frames using an exposure time of
25 ms and an EM-multiplication setting corresponding to a gain of 35.5. Events
were detected and localized (Baddeley et al., 2009) and reconstructions were
rendered using jittered triangulation (Baddeley et al., 2010) (see Supplemental
Experimental Procedures).
Statistics
Data represented as mean ± SEM. Two-tail unpaired Student’s t tests were
employed for comparisons between two groups. p values in cases of multiple
t-tests were corrected with Bonferroni method. One-way and two-way ANOVA
tests were used for multiple group comparions with post hoc Tukey tests. A
probability of p < 0.05 was considered indicative of significant differences be-
tween groups.
