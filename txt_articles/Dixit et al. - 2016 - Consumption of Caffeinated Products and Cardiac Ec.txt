Background-—Premature cardiac contractions are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Though experts associate
premature atrial contractions (PACs) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) with caffeine, there are no data to support this
relationship in the general population. As certain caffeinated products may have cardiovascular benefits, recommendations against
them may be detrimental.
Methods and Results-—We studied Cardiovascular Health Study participants with a baseline food frequency assessment, 24-
hour ambulatory electrocardiography (Holter) monitoring, and without persistent atrial fibrillation. Frequencies of habitual
coffee, tea, and chocolate consumption were assessed using a picture-sort food frequency survey. The main outcomes were
PACs/h and PVCs/hour. Among 1388 participants (46% male, mean age 72 years), 840 (61%) consumed ≥1 caffeinated
product per day. The median numbers of PACs and PVCs/h and interquartile ranges were 3 (1–12) and 1 (0–7), respectively.
There were no differences in the number of PACs or PVCs/h across levels of coffee, tea, and chocolate consumption. After
adjustment for potential confounders, more frequent consumption of these products was not associated with ectopy. In
examining combined dietary intake of coffee, tea, and chocolate as a continuous measure, no relationships were observed
after multivariable adjustment: 0.48% fewer PACs/h (95% CI �4.60 to 3.64) and 2.87% fewer PVCs/h (95% CI �8.18 to 2.43)
per 1-serving/week increase in consumption.
Conclusions-—In the largest study to evaluate dietary patterns and quantify cardiac ectopy using 24-hour Holter monitoring, we
found no relationship between chronic consumption of caffeinated products and ectopy. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:e002503

remature cardiac contractions, otherwise known as atrial
and ventricular ectopy, are common throughout the
general population.1,2 Previously, these ectopic beats were
believed to be harmless in the absence of known cardiovas-
cular disease or symptoms; however, there is now evidence to
indicate
that premature atrial contractions
(PACs)
and
premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are associated
with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. PACs
are known to initiate paroxysms of atrial fibrillation (AF), and
targeted ablation of ectopic foci in the atria can eliminate or
significantly reduce AF recurrence.3 In addition, we previously
showed that the PAC count is a particularly useful predictor of
incident AF in older adults,4 and others have demonstrated
that increased PACs in apparently healthy individuals are
associated with incident AF, stroke, and death.5 With regard
to PVCs, the presence of even one PVC during a 2-minute ECG
has been associated with an increased risk of incident
congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD)
events, and CAD-related death.6,7 Additionally, our group has
previously demonstrated that a higher frequency of PVCs is
associated with an increase in incident CHF and with
increased mortality.8 Furthermore, recent evidence from the
electrophysiology laboratory has shown that eradication of
PVCs
via radiofrequency ablation among patients
with
idiopathic systolic heart failure can normalize ventricular
function, suggesting that PVCs alone are sufficient to result in
heart failure.9
Although a causal relationship between PACs and AF or
PVCs and heart failure cannot be determined by these large
epidemiologic studies, extrapolation from data already avail-
able from the electrophysiology laboratory has raised interest
in the theoretical benefit of prophylactic PAC and PVC
ablation.4,10 However,

 exposures that may reduce or prevent frequent PACs or
PVCs.
Patients often associate the symptoms of premature
cardiac contractions with emotional stress, physical activity,
dietary factors, and caffeine or other stimulant use.11 Though
there is little data to support the role of behavioral
modifications or trigger avoidance in reducing or preventing
premature cardiac contractions, clinicians often instruct
patients with any arrhythmia to avoid caffeine intake. The
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association
guidelines on the management of supraventricular arrhyth-
mias state that if a patient’s history is consistent with
premature extra beats, one should review and eliminate
potential exacerbating factors, such as caffeine, alcohol, and
nicotine.12 Prominent online medical resources for clinicians,
such as UpToDate and Medscape, feature similar recommen-
dations for the management of premature beats.13,14 While
none of these sources explicitly refer to the acute versus
chronic effects of caffeine on ectopy, they focus on general
avoidance in order to avoid triggering arrhythmias. Caffeine is
of particular interest because of its known sympathomimetic
effects, leading to increased plasma norepinephrine and
epinephrine levels15 and, as a result, possibly increasing
ectopy. While most observational and experimental studies
examining the effect of caffeine intake on arrhythmogenesis
have been negative, the majority of them focus on populations
known to have increased premature cardiac contractions,
arrhythmias such as supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or
ventricular tachycardia (VT), or other heart disease.16–19 In
addition, most of the interventional trials investigating the
effects of caffeine or other lifestyle modifications on arrhyth-
mias were performed several decades ago11 and frequently
did not use premature cardiac contractions as a primary
outcome.18
Recent and growing evidence points to the potential
beneficial cardiovascular effects of several common caf-
feinated products, including coffee,20 chocolate,21 and tea.22
There may therefore be uncertainty in counseling patients
regarding consumption of these products, and many patients
may reduce their exposure in order to avoid the presumed
arrhythmogenic effect at the expense of possible benefits. We
thus sought to study the relationship between chronic
consumption of these potentially healthy caffeinated products
and cardiac ectopy in a community-based cohort.
Methods
Study Design
The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is a prospective,
community-based cohort study sponsored by the National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Details surrounding eligibil-
ity, enrollment, and follow-up have been previously pub-
lished.23–25 In short, 5201 individuals 65 years or older were
recruited between 1989 and 1990 from a random sample of
Medicare beneficiaries by 4 academic centers (Johns Hopkins
University, Wake Forest University, University of Pittsburgh,
and University of California, Davis). An additional 687 black
participants were recruited between 1992 and 1993. Each
center’s institutional review committee approved the study,
and all individuals gave informed consent. At enrollment, all
participants had a medical history, clinic examination, labo-
ratory testing, and 12-lead ECG performed. Participants were
then followed with annual clinic visits and semiannual
telephone contact for 10 years, with telephone contact
continued every 6 months thereafter.
Study Cohort
A total of 1416 individuals from the initial cohort (those
recruited between 1989 and 1990) were randomly selected
(from all original-cohort CHS participants) to undergo 24-hour
ambulatory electrocardiography (Holter) monitoring during
their initial assessment and completed the baseline food
frequency questionnaire. Participants with persistent AF
throughout the Holter period were excluded, leaving 1388
individuals for analysis.
Dietary Assessment
At baseline, participants completed a picture-sort exercise
derived from the 99-item National Cancer Institute food
frequency questionnaire. Individuals were given a set of cards
naming and showing a particular food or beverage. They were
then asked to sort the cards into 5 marked categories based
on how often they on average consumed that food over the
past 12 months. The picture-sort approach used in CHS was
validated against 6 detailed 24-hour dietary recall interviews
spaced 1-month apart and found to be as accurate as more
conventional,
quantitative
methods
of
dietary
assess-
ment.26,27 Caffeinated coffee (in contrast to decaffeinated
coffee), tea, and chocolate were the 3 items from the
questionnaire included in this study. When describing “chronic
consumption” of caffeinated products, we are referring to the
average frequency of consumption over the past 12 months.
Assessment of Ectopy and Arrhythmia
Holter data were analyzed at the Washington University
School of Medicine Heart Rate Variability Laboratory using a
MARS 8000 Holter scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee,
WI) and manually reviewed to ensure accuracy. The number of
supraventricular ectopic beats, or PACs, per hour and number
of ventricular ectopic beats, or PVCs, per hour were recorded

 throughout the duration of Holter monitoring. SVT and VT
episodes were evaluated as the total number of discrete
episodes (or “runs” defined as 3 or more consecutive beats)
during Holter monitoring.
Covariate Ascertainment
Self-identified race was categorized as white, black, and other.
Self-identified sex was classified as male or female. Self-
reported income, defined as total combined family income
before taxes, was categorized into 3 groups: <$12 000,
$12 000 to 34 999, and ≥$35 000. Self-reported education
level was categorized into 5 groups: high school or less,
vocational school, some college, 4 years of college, and
postgraduate education. Body mass index was calculated from
baseline height and weight measurements. A measure of daily
caloric intake was calculated from the picture-sort food
frequency questionnaire. Diabetes mellitus was defined as
reported use of an antihyperglycemic medication at baseline or
a fasting glucose level of ≥126 mmol/L. Smoking status was
defined as never, past, or current. Participants reported their
usual frequency of consumption of beer, wine, and liquor, and
the usual number of servings of each drink on each occasion,
from which total weekly alcohol consumption was calculated.
Hypertension was defined as either a reported history of
physician-diagnosed hypertension plus use of antihypertensive
medications, systolic blood pressure of ≥140 mm Hg, or
diastolic pressure of ≥90 mm Hg. AF was defined as a
reported history of AF, AF on baseline 12-lead ECG, or AF
detected on Holter. CHF and myocardial infarction (MI) were
identified by participant self-report and were confirmed by
medical record verification. CAD was defined as angina,
previous MI, previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or
previous angioplasty.25 Information regarding prescription
medications used in the preceding 2 weeks was collected at
baseline directly from prescription bottles, including use of b-
blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, class I antiar-
rhythmics, and class III antiarrhythmics.23
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables with normal distribution are presented
as means� SD and were compared using the Student t test.
Non-normally distributed continuous variables are presented
as medians with interquartile ranges and were compared
using the Kruskal–Wallis test. The association between
categorical variables was determined using the v2 test.
Dietary intake for coffee, tea, and chocolate were analyzed
as both categorical and numeric variables. To convert from
self-reported categories of consumption to a numeric mea-
surement, we estimated the average weekly consumption per
category. Specifically, the categories of never, 5 to 10 times
per year, 1 to 3 times per month, 1 to 4 times per week, and
almost every day were transformed to 0, 0.144, 0.5, 2.5, and
6 servings per week, respectively, by approximating the
midpoint of the frequency category, as has been done
previously.28 In addition, from these calculations we gener-
ated a variable to represent total weekly consumption of
coffee, tea, and chocolate.
Linear regression was used to examine the relationship
between consumption of caffeinated products and the log-
transformed numbers of PACs, PVCs, SVT, and VT on Holter
monitoring. Frequency of consumption was analyzed as both a
categorical and a continuous variable. Outcomes (PACs, PVCs,
SVT, and VT) were natural log-transformed to meet model
normality assumptions, after adding 0.01 to the counts so that
participants with zero counts were retained in the analysis.
Regression coefficients for caffeine consumption were back-
transformed using the formula 1009[exp(ß)�1] and inter-
preted as percent changes in outcome frequency per unit
increase in the predictor. Multivariable linear regression was
performed to adjust for potential confounding. Covariates
added to these models included age, sex, race, income,
education, body mass index, daily caloric intake, smoking
status, number of alcoholic drinks per week, diabetes, hyper-
tension, CAD, AF, CHF, and use of b-blockers, calcium channel
blockers, digoxin, class I antiarrhythmics, and class III antiar-
rhythmics. In addition, an analysis was performed adjusting for
potential confounders previously associated with AF, specifi-
cally tuna and broiled or baked fish consumption29 and markers
of physical activity (number of blocks walked, walking pace,
total kilocalories of physical activity, and exercise intensity).30
We also performed analyses in which we adjusted for
consumption of other caffeinated products (ie, in examining
coffee intake we adjusted for tea and chocolate intake).
We checked the residuals for normality, equal variance
across categories, and influential points and found no
important violations, indicating that our models met standard
assumptions. Given the nature of our outcomes, we also
modeled our data using negative binomial regression and
found no meaningful differences as compared to multivariate
linear regression. Finally, we tested for the interaction
between cardiovascular disease (defined as the presence of
diabetes, hypertension, CAD, CHF, or AF at baseline) and
caffeine on the risk of cardiac ectopy.
Data were analyzed using Stata 13 (StataCorp, College
Station, TX). A 2-tailed P<0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

those, 28 individuals were excluded on the basis of persistent
AF. Greater than 60% of participants reported consuming on
average one or more servings of coffee, tea, or chocolate per
day. The baseline characteristics of participants stratified by
consumption of caffeinated products are summarized in
Table 1. Those who consumed at least one serving of a

 drank more alcohol; there were no other significant differ-
ences observed.
In unadjusted analyses, there were no statistically signif-
icant differences in the number of PACs/h, PVCs/h, SVT runs,
or VT runs across levels of habitual coffee, tea, and chocolate
consumption (Table 2). For instance, focusing on coffee and
PACs, the median number of PACs and interquartile range
among the every-day drinkers was 3 (1–11) compared with 2
(1–11) among the never drinkers. Similarly, median PACs was
consistently approximately 3, while median number of PVCs
was consistently about 1, regardless of the quantity of
caffeinated products consumed.
In adjusted analyses, there were similarly no statistically
significant associations between frequencies of coffee, tea, or
chocolate consumption and PACs/h, PVCs/h, or number of
SVT runs (Table 3). The consumption of coffee 1 to 4 times
per week (versus no coffee) and the consumption of tea 5 to
10 times per year (versus no tea) were each associated with a
greater number of runs of VT. Tests for trends across levels of
consumption failed to reveal any statistically significant linear
or nonlinear trends for all 4 outcomes.
In examining dietary intake of coffee, tea, and chocolate as
continuous measures and as a combined measure of total
average consumption, we found no statistically significant
relationships between weekly servings of caffeinated products
and cardiac ectopy, SVT, and VT (Figure). We observed a non–
statistically significant estimated 0.48% decrease in PACs/h
(95% CI �4.60 to 3.64) as well as a non–statistically
significant estimated 2.87% decrease in PVCs/h (95% CI
�8.18 to 2.43) for every 1 serving per week increase in
regular consumption.
Additional analyses adjusting for factors associated with
AF, such as fish consumption and physical activity, did not
meaningfully alter the results. Similarly, adjusting for the
effects of other caffeinated product consumption did not
reveal any further associations between coffee, tea, or
chocolate and cardiac ectopy. No statistically significant
interactions between the presence of cardiovascular disease
(defined as the presence of diabetes, hypertension, CAD, CHF,
or AF at baseline) and caffeine on the risk of PACs, PVCs, SVT,
or VT were observed (P=0.17, 0.13, 0.37, and 0.77, respec-
tively).

 Discussion
In an investigation of nearly 1400 older adults, we found no
evidence that the frequency of habitual coffee, tea, or
chocolate consumption was associated with cardiac ectopy
before or after multivariable adjustment. This absence of
association between caffeine and arrhythmias did not change
whether caffeine was treated as a continuous or a categorical
predictor.
Premature cardiac contractions are a common, often
asymptomatic condition. However, given the growing evi-
dence linking both PACs and PVCs to increased cardiovascu-
lar morbidity and mortality, it is important we further our
understanding of risk factors for ectopy. Increased PACs, even

Caffeinated Products and Cardiac Ectopy

 among healthy individuals, have been associated with incident
AF, stroke, and death.5 Furthermore, the presence of PVCs in
those free of heart disease has been associated with an
increased risk of incident heart failure, CAD events, and CAD-
related death.6,7 Our study is the first to examine chronic
consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy in a
community-based population using 24-hour Holter monitoring
to directly assess PAC and PVC counts. Prior studies have
focused on populations with previous diagnoses of symp-
tomatic ventricular ectopy, arrhythmia, or MI, making it
difficult to generalize their findings to other populations.16–19
Furthermore, our study used a validated approach to assess-
ing food frequencies to approximate a person’s typical
consumption, as compared to other studies that have
administered predetermined caffeine doses regardless of a
person’s average consumption.17,18,31
Previous research examining the role of caffeine in ectopy
and arrhythmia largely supports our negative findings. Though
caffeine consumption has long been related to cardiac ectopy
and arrhythmias by anecdote and biological plausibility, few
studies have demonstrated any relationship. Several inter-
ventional studies have failed to demonstrate an effect of
caffeine intake on ectopy and arrhythmias. One of the earliest
studies was a randomized controlled trial of a 6-week lifestyle
intervention among 81 healthy men with persistent PVCs.11
Participants were randomly allocated to a control group where
they were asked to maintain their usual life habits, to an
intervention group where they were asked to abstain from
caffeine-containing compounds (including coffee, tea, cola
beverages, and chocolate), quit smoking, limit alcohol intake,
and obtain sufficient sleep, or to a second intervention group
consisting of the prior modifications in addition to a
supervised physical conditioning program. The intervention
had no significant effect on the occurrence of frequency of
PVCs.
In another interventional study, researchers gave partici-
pants with a history of malignant ventricular arrhythmias an
oral caffeine load of 275 mg, similar to that found in 2 to 3
cups of coffee, and performed electrophysiological testing
1 hour prior to and 1 hour after coffee administration.18 They

(white square) and adjusted (black square) estimates shown are after adjustment for clinic site, age, sex, race, income, education level, body
mass index, dietary caloric intake, smoking status, number of alcoholic drinks per week, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, atrial
fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and use of b-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, class I antiarrhythmics, and class III
antiarrhythmics. Y error bars denote 95% CIs. PAC indicates premature atrial contraction; PVC, premature ventricular contraction; SVT, number
of runs of supraventricular tachycardia; VT, number of runs of ventricular tachycardia.

 found that caffeine did not affect the inducibility or severity of
arrhythmias in these patients. Similarly, another group of
researchers performed a study of 50 consecutive patients
with malignant ventricular arrhythmias, administering decaf-
feinated coffee versus decaffeinated coffee mixed with
200 mg of caffeine, and monitored continuous electrocardio-
graphic recordings during a 30-minute control period and a
3-hour observation period, including an hourly bicycle test.17
They found no difference in the number of PVCs, rates of
ventricular couplets, or salvos of VT between the 2 groups,
concluding that there was no evidence to suggest that a
modest dose of caffeine is arrhythmogenic, even in patients at
high risk. Furthermore, high-dose caffeine administered to a
group of 34 healthy adults also failed to increase ectopy,
arrhythmias, or even heart rate during a 24-hour Holter
monitor period.31 Finally, a study of over 3000 patients
hospitalized for cardiac arrhythmias actually found an inverse
relationship between reported coffee and caffeine intake and
hospitalization for arrhythmias, suggesting it is unlikely that
moderate caffeine intake increases arrhythmia risk.32
Despite a lack of evidence for caffeine abstention or
moderation in reducing premature cardiac contractions and
arrhythmias, clinicians and treatment guidelines often recom-
mend that such patients avoid caffeine. For example,
published guidelines on the management of supraventricular
arrhythmias advocate reviewing and eliminating potential
exacerbating factors, such as caffeine, alcohol, and nico-
tine.12 Popular resources for clinicians, including UpToDate
and Medscape, offer similar suggestions for the management
of premature beats.13,14
Coffee is among the most commonly consumed beverages
in the United States20 and is the main source of caffeine
intake among adults.33 The biological impact of coffee may be
substantial and is not limited to the effects of caffeine.
Regular coffee consumption has been associated with a lower
risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and other cardiovascular risk
factors such as obesity and depression.20 Furthermore, large
observational studies have found that habitual coffee drinkers
have lower rates of CAD and of cardiovascular and all-cause
mortality.34,35 However, not all evidence favors a protective
effect of coffee on CAD. Specifically, one case–control study
found an increased risk of MI in the hour after coffee
consumption.36 Interestingly, this effect was stronger in light/
occasional coffee drinkers (<1 cup/day) as compared to
moderate coffee drinkers (2–3 cups/day) and absent among
heavy coffee drinkers (≥4 cups/day). In considering these
results, however, it is important to recognize that recall bias
may have played a role, given that participants were
interviewed immediately post-MI regarding their behaviors
prior to the event. In addition, chocolate and tea are caffeine-
containing compounds that have also been postulated to have
cardioprotective effects because of their high flavonoid
content.21 Flavonoids boast antioxidant properties and have
been shown to increase nitric oxide availability inducing
vasodilation, which possibly accounts for the described
protective effects of cocoa consumption on the vascular
endothelium.37 Short-term administration of dark chocolate,
which has a higher flavonoid content, has been shown to
lower blood pressure in both hypertensive and healthy
subjects.38,39 In addition, studies have demonstrated that
chocolate and tea consumption bear inverse relationships to
prevalent and incident CAD, respectively.21,22
Our results support a long history of data from both
experimental and observational trials indicating that moderate
consumption of caffeine is not associated with cardiac ectopy
and extend that evidence from predominately arrhythmia
patients to a community-based cohort. Findings from this
study suggest that the regular consumption of specific
caffeinated products, in aggregate or alone, is not associated
with cardiac ectopy in the general population. Though we
observed an association between 2 isolated frequencies of
coffee and tea intake and number of VT runs, these results
were not in line with the general observations, none of the
unadjusted analyses were statistically significant, and the
multivariable adjusted regression coefficients showed no
trend towards increased or decreased VT across increasing
categories of coffee and tea consumption. While we cannot
exclude a true effect between these very specific amounts of
caffeinated product consumption and VT, we suspect these
results are likely false positives due to multiple hypothesis
testing. In addition, analyzing coffee and tea consumption as
continuous measures did not reveal any significant relation-
ships with VT.
Several limitations of our study must be acknowledged.
First, while insufficient power is a common explanation for
negative results, it is important to emphasize that even at the
extremes of the 95% CI there was no evidence of a clinically
large effect. We also relied on self-report for the quantification
of caffeinated product consumption. While self-report may be
less accurate than other methods of tracking dietary intake,
food frequency questionnaires are commonly used in dietary
assessment, and the picture-sort approach used in CHS has
been previously validated.26,27 Furthermore, food frequency
questionnaires allow for the assessment of habitual dietary
patterns over extended periods of time. A concern is that these
data only give us insight into average consumption and not
what participants ate immediately prior to and during the
Holter monitoring. While this may be a disadvantage, our study
remains unique in its rigorous, validated assessment of dietary
intake combined with 24-hour ECG monitoring, and it would
appear unlikely that typical dietary patterns would have
changed substantially on the day of the Holter in most
participants. In addition, it is improbable that recall bias
affected our dietary assessment, given that participants were

 unaware of how the dietary information would later be used
and that those who received baseline Holter monitoring were
randomly selected from the total study population. Other
limitations surrounding the dietary assessment include the
absence of total caffeine quantification and specifically data on
caffeinated soda consumption. Nonetheless, in order for soda
intake to confound our negative findings, its effect would have
to be greater than that of coffee, tea, and chocolate combined
in increasing cardiac ectopy, which seems unlikely. Another
shortcoming of the caffeine assessment is that it does not
discriminate among amounts of daily consumption. Therefore,
we are only able to conclude that in general, consuming
caffeinated products every day is not associated with having
increased ectopy or arrhythmia but cannot specify a particular
amount per day. It is possible that those participants most
prone to ectopy in the setting of caffeine may have already
reduced or eliminated their caffeine intake. However, it is well
established that arrhythmias are often asymptomatic,40–42 and
this limitation would likely only apply to participants with
symptomatic ectopy. Finally, as we examined several cate-
gories of consumption for coffee, tea, and chocolate and 4
different electrocardiographic outcomes, there is a possibility
that false positive results may arise due to multiple compar-
isons. However, given our generally consistently negative
findings regarding caffeine and ectopy, this in fact strengthens
our confidence that there were no real positive associations.
In the largest cohort study to ascertain dietary data and
quantify cardiac ectopy using 24-hour Holter monitoring and
the first to do so in a community-based cohort, we found no
evidence that chronic consumption of caffeinated products
was associated with more PACs or PVCs. Our findings suggest
that clinical recommendations advising against the regular
consumption of caffeinated products to prevent cardiac
ectopy and arrhythmia should be reconsidered. However,
whether acute consumption of these caffeinated products
affects cardiac ectopy requires further study.
