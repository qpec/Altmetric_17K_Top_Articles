BACKGROUND
Previous studies conducted between 1997 and 2003 estimated that the risk of 
stroke or an acute coronary syndrome was 12 to 20% during the first 3 months 
after a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke. The TIAregistry.org project 
was designed to describe the contemporary profile, etiologic factors, and out-
comes in patients with a TIA or minor ischemic stroke who receive care in health 
systems that now offer urgent evaluation by stroke specialists.
METHODS
We recruited patients who had had a TIA or minor stroke within the previous 7 days. 
Sites were selected if they had systems dedicated to urgent evaluation of patients 
with TIA. We estimated the 1-year risk of stroke and of the composite outcome of 
stroke, an acute coronary syndrome, or death from cardiovascular causes. We also 
examined the association of the ABCD2 score for the risk of stroke (range, 0 [lowest 
risk] to 7 [highest risk]), findings on brain imaging, and cause of TIA or minor 
stroke with the risk of recurrent stroke over a period of 1 year.
RESULTS
From 2009 through 2011, we enrolled 4789 patients at 61 sites in 21 countries. 
A total of 78.4% of the patients were evaluated by stroke specialists within 24 hours 
after symptom onset. A total of 33.4% of the patients had an acute brain infarc-
tion, 23.2% had at least one extracranial or intracranial stenosis of 50% or more, 
and 10.4% had atrial fibrillation. The Kaplan–Meier estimate of the 1-year event 
rate of the composite cardiovascular outcome was 6.2% (95% confidence interval, 
5.5 to 7.0). Kaplan–Meier estimates of the stroke rate at days 2, 7, 30, 90, and 365 were 
1.5%, 2.1%, 2.8%, 3.7%, and 5.1%, respectively. In multivariable analyses, multiple 
infarctions on brain imaging, large-artery atherosclerosis, and an ABCD2 score of 
6 or 7 were each associated with more than a doubling of the risk of stroke.
CONCLUSIONS
We observed a lower risk of cardiovascular events after TIA than previously re-
ported. The ABCD2 score, findings on brain imaging, and status with respect to 
large-artery atherosclerosis helped stratify the risk of recurrent stroke within 1 year 
after a TIA or minor stroke. (Funded by Sanofi and Bristol-Myers Squibb.)

revious studies conducted between 
1997 and 2003 estimated that the risk of 
stroke or an acute coronary syndrome was 
12 to 20% during the first 3 months after a 
transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke.1,2 
Since then, there have been major changes in the 
management of TIA, including urgent manage-
ment in specialized units, implementation of 
immediate investigations, and rapid treatment 
with antithrombotic agents and other stroke-
prevention strategies.1-4 Given these changes, the 
current prognosis of patients who have had a 
TIA and the role of risk-scoring systems in pa-
tients receiving urgent care are unclear.5-11 Cur-
rent guidelines recommend triage of patients on 
the basis of the risk of stroke as assessed by the 
ABCD2 (age, blood pressure, clinical findings, 
duration of symptoms, and presence or absence 
of diabetes) score. Scores range from 0 to 7, with 
higher scores indicating a greater risk of stroke; 
an age of 60 years or older, a blood-pressure 
level of 140/90 mm Hg or higher, a clinical find-
ing of unilateral weakness or speech impairment, 
a duration of symptoms of 10 to 59 minutes, and 
diabetes are each assigned 1 point, and a dura-
tion of symptoms of 60 minutes or more is as-
signed 2 points. Urgent care of patients with TIA 
within 24 hours after symptom onset is recom-
mended when the ABCD2 score is 4 or more.12,13 
However, ABCD2 scores of 4 or more do not 
identify all patients needing immediate treat-
ment.14-16 The widespread introduction of emer-
gency services for patients who have had a TIA 
or minor stroke in most developed health care 
systems makes it important to reassess progno-
sis and risk stratification.
The TIAregistry.org project was designed to 
describe the contemporary profile, etiologic fac-
tors, and short-term (1-year) and long-term (5-year) 
outcomes in patients with a TIA or minor ische-
mic stroke and to refine risk assessment in the 
context of modern stroke prevention and man-
agement. Here we report 1-year follow-up data.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
The TIAregistry.org project is an international, 
prospective, observational registry of patients 
who have had a recent TIA or minor stroke, in-
volving 5 years of clinical follow-up. The proto-
col was approved by local institutional review 
boards. All patients gave written or oral in-
formed consent according to country regulation.
This study was an investigator-driven initia-
tive and was supported by an unrestricted grant 
from Sanofi and Bristol-Myers Squibb, both of 
which had no involvement in the design or con-
duct of the study, the analysis or interpretation 
of the data, or the writing of the manuscript. 
SOS-Attaque Cérébrale Association (a not-for-profit 
organization) and the Charles Foix Group (an 
academic research organization for clinical trials 
in stroke at Université Paris-Diderot, Sorbonne-
Paris Cité) were responsible for the conduct of 
the study.
Study Population
Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were 
18 years of age or older and had had a TIA or 
minor stroke within the 7 days before evaluation 
by stroke specialists. Eligible patients had focal 
retinal or brain ischemia with resolution of 
symptoms or minor strokes with a score on the 
modified Rankin scale (range, 0 to 6, with 0 in-
dicating no symptoms, 1 no disability, and 
6 death) of 0 or 1 when first evaluated by stroke 
specialists. The modified Rankin scale was used 
instead of the National Institutes of Health 
Stroke Scale as a pragmatic approach to rating 
minor focal neurologic events that had no effect 
on disability. Detailed descriptions of the poten-
tial residual neurologic deficits at admission 
were captured in the case-report forms.
Sites were selected in 21 countries on the 
basis of the existence of a dedicated system for 
the care of patients with TIA (with care delivered 
by stroke specialists) and a yearly volume of at 
least 100 patients during the previous 3 years. 
Emergency departments, stroke units, day clinics, 
and outpatient clinics were the care settings; the 
systems varied across centers except that at all 
centers, all patients were evaluated on an urgent 
basis by stroke specialists (most of them were 
neurologists, and the other physicians special-
ized in stroke care). (For additional details, see 
the Supplementary Appendix, available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org.)
Evaluation
Stroke specialists collected patient data pro-
spectively, using a standardized Web-based case-
report form, during face-to-face interviews at the 
time of evaluation of the qualifying event (base-

line), at 1, 3, and 12 months after baseline, and 
every 12 months thereafter for 5 years. If the 
patient could not be reached for follow-up, a 
relative or family doctor was interviewed by tele-
phone. At baseline, information was obtained on 
clinical symptoms during the qualifying event, 
the occurrence of clinical events after the quali-
fying event, and sociodemographic characteris-
tics; a medical history was obtained and a 
physical examination performed; investigations 
(including brain and cerebral-artery imaging 
and cardiac investigations) were recommended; 
and management of care (e.g., medical treatment 
or revascularization procedure) was recorded. 
Patients were evaluated at follow-up for clinical 
events, medical treatment, and main risk factors 
(smoking status, blood pressure, and lipid profile).
Definitions of Clinical Events and Outcomes
Any clinical event after the qualifying event (i.e., 
after the patient first sought medical attention), 
even if the event occurred before evaluation by a 
stroke specialist, was considered to be an out-
come event, as judged by the individual investi-
gators. Primary outcome events and bleeding 
events were reviewed by two of the investigators 
(the first and second authors) on the basis of 
narrative descriptions. The primary study out-
come was defined as a composite outcome that 
included death from cardiovascular causes, non-
fatal stroke (either ischemic or hemorrhagic), and 
nonfatal acute coronary syndrome (myocardial 
infarction with or without ST-segment elevation 
or unstable angina followed by urgent catheter-
ization). Secondary outcomes included individu-
al components of the primary outcome, TIA re-
currence, death from any cause, and bleeding. 
Ischemic stroke was defined as one of the fol-
lowing: a new symptomatic neurologic deteriora-
tion lasting at least 24 hours that was not at-
tributable to a nonischemic cause, or a new 
symptomatic neurologic deterioration that was 
not attributable to a nonischemic cause and was 
accompanied by neuroimaging evidence of new 
brain infarction. Hemorrhagic stroke was de-
fined as acute extravasation of blood into the 
brain parenchyma. Death from cardiovascular 
causes included fatal acute coronary syndrome, 
fatal stroke, fatal intracranial hemorrhage, fatal 
pulmonary embolism, sudden death, and unob-
served or unexpected death. Fatal stroke or acute 
coronary syndrome was defined as an event that 
was followed by death within 30 days. TIA was 
defined as new symptomatic neurologic deteriora-
tion lasting less than 24 hours with no new in-
farction on neuroimaging. Bleeding was catego-
rized according to the Global Utilization of 
Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Factor for 
Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) defini-
tions.17
Statistical Analysis
We initially calculated that a sample size of 5000 
would allow a 10% relative precision in the esti-
mate of the rate of the primary outcome after a 
maximum follow-up of 5 years (corresponding 
to a maximum enrollment period of 4 years and 
a minimum follow-up period of 1 year), assum-
ing an average annual risk of composite events 
of 2.5%. Because we decided to follow all pa-
tients for 5 years and to perform a short-term 
analysis at the 1-year follow-up, we calculated 
(using the Peto method for calculating the stan-
dard error of survival at a given time) that with 
a 25% attrition rate at 5 years, the relative preci-
sion of the estimates of the composite event rate 
would be 18% at 1 year and 9% at 5 years.
Continuous variables are expressed as means 
and standard deviations or medians and inter-
quartile ranges, and categorical variables are ex-
pressed as frequencies and percentages. Cumu-
lative event curves were constructed for the 
primary outcome and selected secondary out-
comes with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method. 
Crude event rates were determined from Kaplan–
Meier rates and compared with the use of the 
log-rank test. For a given outcome, deaths from 
causes other than those included in the outcome 
were treated as censoring events. Data on pa-
tients with no information at 1 year were cen-
sored at the time of the last follow-up available. 
Events that occurred after the 1-year follow-up 
period were not included in the current analysis.
We estimated and compared the risk of stroke 
in subgroups of patients categorized according 
to the time from symptom onset to evaluation by 
a stroke specialist (≤24 hours vs. >24 hours), 
ABCD2 score (≤3 vs. 4 or 5 vs. 6 or 7),5 the num-
ber of acute (new) infarction-related lesions (0 vs. 
1 vs. ≥1), and the probable cause of the initial 
TIA or minor stroke according to the Trial of Org

fication (large-artery atherosclerosis, cardioem-
bolism, small-vessel occlusion, other determined

cause, or undetermined cause). Given that the 
ABCD2 score, acute infarctions on brain imag-
ing, and TOAST classification have been previ-
ously reported to be associated with stroke re-
currence,7 a Cox proportional-hazards regression 
model was used to evaluate whether these three 
predictors were independently associated with 
stroke recurrence. The proportional-hazards as-
sumption was verified with the use of Schoen-
feld residuals. Owing to missing data on the 
ABCD2 score, acute infarction lesions, and 
TOAST classification, we performed a sensitivity 
analysis with multiple imputation of missing 
values by means of chained equations (10 imput-
ed data sets were generated with the use of all 
patient characteristics described in Table 1).18
Statistical testing was conducted at a two-
tailed alpha level of 0.01 to account for multiple 
comparisons. Data were analyzed with the use 
of SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute).
Results
Characteristics of Patients Enrolled
From June 2009 through December 2011, a total 
of 4789 patients at 61 sites in 21 countries were 
enrolled in the TIAregistry.org project, of whom 
4583 were included in the analysis; 173 patients 
did not meet inclusion criteria, and 33 had no 
follow-up data owing in almost all cases to the 
emergence of another cause for their TIA-like 
event (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
A total of 4013 patients (87.6%) sought medical 
attention within 24 hours after symptom onset, 
and 89.5% of these (3593 patients, or 78.4% of 
those included in this analysis) were examined 
by stroke specialists within 24 hours (Table 1). 
The median length of hospital stay was 4 days. 
Baseline characteristics of the patients are shown 
in Table 1. The two most frequent clinical symp-
toms of the qualifying event were weakness 
(55.0%) and speech abnormalities (48.3%). Patients 
evaluated by a stroke specialist within 24 hours 
after symptom onset had a higher ABCD2 score 
than patients seen after 24 hours; the mean 
(±SD) ABCD2 score was 4.7±1.5 in patients seen 
within 24 hours, as compared with 3.8±1.6 in 
patients seen after 24 hours (P<0.001). (Addi-
tional details regarding the characteristics of the 
patients are provided in Tables S1 and S2 and

One-Year Risk of Stroke after TIA or Minor Stroke
Investigations and Treatments
The main findings from investigations are listed 
in Table 2. Medications used before admission 
and at the time of discharge are listed in Ta-
ble 3. During evaluation at baseline by a stroke 
specialist, 5.0% of the patients (199 of the 3960 
patients for whom data were available) received 
a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, and 66.8% 
of these patients (133 patients) received antico-
agulant therapy before discharge. A carotid steno-
sis of 50% or more was found in 15.5% of the 
patients (618 of 3993 patients for whom data 
were available), and 26.9% of them (166 patients) 
underwent carotid revascularization before dis-
charge. The rates of self-reported medication use 
at 3 months and at 12 months were similar to the 
rates of use at the time of discharge, findings 
that support the accuracy of self-reported medica-
tion adherence (Table 3). At 12 months, the mean 
systolic blood pressure was 133±17 mm Hg, and 
the mean level of low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol was 95±34 mg per deciliter (2.46±0.88 mmol 
per liter) (Table S3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Outcomes
At the time of database extraction (July 24, 
2015), patients had been followed for a median 
of 27.2 months (interquartile range, 12.4 to 
48.1); 4200 patients (91.6%) had died or had 
had at least 1 year of follow-up. At 1 year, a 
total of 274 primary outcome events had oc-
curred (25 deaths from cardiovascular causes, 
210 nonfatal strokes, and 39 nonfatal acute 
coronary syndromes), corresponding to a Ka-
plan–Meier estimate of the primary outcome 
event rate of 6.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
5.5 to 7.0) (Fig. 1). With respect to secondary 
outcomes, death from any cause occurred in 80 
patients (Kaplan–Meier estimate, 1.8%), any re-
current stroke or TIA in 533 (12.0%), any acute 
coronary syndrome in 46 (1.1%), and any bleed-
ing in 87 (2.0%), including 16 with moderately 
severe bleeding and 18 with major bleeding 
(Table 4, and Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
The 2-day, 7-day, 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year 
rates of stroke according to the time from symp-
tom onset to medical evaluation and according to 
ABCD2 score are shown in Figure S4 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix. Overall, strokes occurred 
in 67 patients (Kaplan–Meier estimate, 1.5%) 
within 2 days after the onset of symptoms in 
the qualifying event, in 95 patients (2.1%) within 
7 days, in 128 patients (2.8%) within 30 days, 
in 168 patients (3.7%) within 90 days, and in 
224 patients (5.1%) within 1 year. The risk of 
stroke tended to increase with a higher ABCD2 
score, with the 1-year risk ranging from 0% 
(score of 0) to 9.6% (score of 7). A total of 22% 
of strokes occurred in patients with an ABCD2 
score of less than 4 (Table S4 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).

Predictors of Outcomes
Figure 2 shows the unadjusted risk of stroke ac-
cording to the time from symptom onset to 
evaluation by a stroke specialist, ABCD2 score, 
finding on brain imaging, and cause of stroke. 
In multivariable Cox regression analysis that in-
cluded imaging findings, ABCD2 scores, and cause 
of stroke according to TOAST classification, the 
following three variables were independently as-
sociated with 1-year stroke risk: multiple acute 
cerebral infarctions on brain imaging (hazard 
ratio for the comparison with no infarctions, 
2.16; 95% CI, 1.46 to 3.21; P<0.001), an ABCD2 
score of 6 or 7 (hazard ratio for the comparison 
with a score of 0 to 3, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.41 to 3.42; 
P<0.001), and large-artery atherosclerosis (haz-
ard ratio for the comparison with undetermined 
cause, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.29 to 3.13; P 
= 
0.002) (Fig. 
S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The results 
were similar when the Cox regression model was 
refitted by introducing ABCD2 score as a con-
tinuous variable (hazard ratio per point, 1.23; 
95% CI, 1.10 to 1.37; P<0.001), multiple acute 
infarctions as a binary variable (hazard ratio, 
2.07; 95% CI, 1.43 to 3.00; P<0.001), and large-
artery atherosclerosis as a binary variable (hazard 
ratio, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.11; P 
= 
0.008). After 
imputation of missing data for ABCD2 score, 
finding on brain imaging, and TOAST classifi-
cation, the estimates were similar. Sensitivity 
analyses restricted to patients who underwent 
diffusion-weighted imaging or to 90-day stroke 
risk yielded similar results (data not shown).
Discussion
The TIAregistry.org project included 4789 pa-
tients who were enrolled over the course of 2.5 
years at 61 TIA clinics; 78% of the patients were 
evaluated by a stroke specialist within 24 hours

One-Year Risk of Stroke after TIA or Minor Stroke
after symptom onset. At 1 year, the Kaplan–
Meier estimate of the risk of the composite 
outcome of major fatal or nonfatal cardiovascu-
lar events was 6.2%, and the estimate of the risk 
of stroke was 5.1%. The risk of recurrent stroke 
at 2 days, 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year 
was less than half that expected from historical 
cohorts; for example, the risk of stroke and 
other vascular events at 90 days in the historical 
cohorts was 12 to 20%,3,4 as compared with 
3.7% in our cohort. The lower event rates in our 
cohort may be explained by better and faster 
implementation of secondary stroke prevention 
strategies (e.g., immediate initiation of anti-
platelet drugs, oral anticoagulation in the event 
of atrial fibrillation, urgent revascularization in 
patients with critical carotid stenosis, and other 
secondary prevention measures such as treatment 
with statins and blood-pressure–lowering drugs) 
in contemporary TIA clinics than in settings 
where historical cohorts received care.3,4
The findings from the current multicenter 
registry suggest that the low risk of stroke re-
ported by single-center registries1,2 in patients 
who had a TIA or minor stroke and who received 
care in TIA clinics that were organized for fast-
track evaluation (reported 1-year stroke risk of 
1.95% in the SOS-TIA trial1 and 3-month stroke 
risk of 2% in the Early Use of Existing Preventive 
Strategies for Stroke [EXPRESS] study2) may be 
achievable in a large range of settings as long as 
patients are evaluated and treated for acute TIA 
and minor stroke on an urgent basis. The efficacy 
of early, intensive treatment with antithrombotic 
agents has also been shown in the recent Clopi-
dogrel in High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondis-
abling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial, 
which included patients with a TIA or minor 
stroke who were treated within 24 hours after 
symptom onset.19 It is evident from the Kaplan–
Meier plot showing the stroke events over time 
in the CHANCE trial that most of the benefit of 
dual antiplatelet therapy as compared with mono-
therapy was achieved within 8 days after symp-
tom onset.19
The good outcomes seen in the TIAregistry.org 
project are not explained by a population that 
was at lower risk than the population in histori-
cal cohorts. More than two thirds of the cohort 
had an ABCD2 score of 4 or more, and the risk 
that we observed was low in each stratum of the 
ABCD2 score (Fig. S4B in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). More than 75% of the patients were 
examined within 24 hours after symptom onset, 
which ensured that early recurrent events were 
identified. The median length of hospital stay of 
4 days did not reflect the severity of the TIA, 
because 70% of the patients had a modified 
Rankin score of 0 and the rest had a modified 
Rankin score of 1. Patients had good adherence 
to treatment recommendations as evaluated at 
the time of discharge and at 1 year (Table 3), 
with rates of treatment that were similar to 
those reported in the SOS-TIA and EXPRESS 
registries, which makes it plausible that the risk 
observed during the follow-up was the risk of 
stroke that remained after treatment of risk fac-
tors, such as anticoagulation therapy for atrial 
fibrillation and antihypertensive and statin med-

Scores on the ABCD2 stroke risk scale range from 0 to 7, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of stroke; an 
age of 60 years or older, a blood‑pressure level of 140/90 mm Hg or higher, a clinical finding of unilateral weakness 
or speech impairment, a duration of symptoms of 10 to 59 minutes, and diabetes are each assigned 1 point, and a 
duration of symptoms of 60 minutes or more is assigned 2 points. The Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment 
(TOAST) classification indicates the probable cause of the initial transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke; the five 
main categories are large‑artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, small‑vessel occlusion, other determined cause, 
and undetermined cause.

One-Year Risk of Stroke after TIA or Minor Stroke
ications to lower levels of blood pressure and 
lipids to recommended targets. The choice of 
evaluating the primary outcome not only at 90 
days, which is commonly used as the follow-up 
time point in trials of TIA or minor stroke, but 
also at 1 year was driven by the expected low 
event rates after 90 days of follow-up. The 1-year 
risk still represents a short-term risk as far as 
lifelong stroke prevention is concerned.
In this study, brain imaging showing multi-
ple infarctions, an ABCD2 score of 6 or 7, and 
large-artery atherosclerosis were each associated 
with more than a doubling in the risk of stroke. 
Despite a much lower event rate than in histori-
cal cohorts, we found that the ABCD2 score was 
still effective at stratifying risk in this urgently 
and intensively treated cohort (Fig. S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix), but we also observed 
that 22% of recurrent strokes occurred in pa-
tients with ABCD2 scores of less than 4 and with 
preventable underlying causes such as atrial fi-
brillation and ipsilateral internal-carotid-artery 
stenosis of 50% or more (Table S4 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).14,15
Other factors independently helped stratify the 
risk of recurrent stroke, such as the presence of 
multiple infarctions on neuroimaging — a new 
finding of this registry. This finding may be 
explained by plaque rupture with multiple distal 
emboli20 or a cardiac source of embolism. Our 
findings also suggest that large-artery athero-
sclerosis is a stroke subtype that is associated 
with a significantly higher risk than the risk with 
other etiologic stroke subtypes (P<0.001) (Fig. 2D, 
and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). In 
the event of cardiac disease (e.g., atrial fibrilla-
tion), anticoagulant therapy in addition to risk-
factor control is so effective that the residual 
risk of stroke after these interventions is proba-
bly very low.13 In patients with small-vessel dis-
ease, blood-pressure–lowering therapy is very 
effective when combined with other risk-factor 
management and antiplatelet therapy.21
This registry has important limitations. First, 
sites were not chosen at random but rather were 
chosen on the basis of the existence of a TIA 
clinic or dedicated care for patients with TIA, 
with at least 100 TIAs evaluated per year during 
the previous 3 years. The median number of 
patients enrolled per site was 54, with a range of 
1 to 640 (many sites joined the registry late in 
the study). This suggests that either investiga-
tors overestimated their annual recruitment rate 
or not all patients were included in the registry. 
However, 4789 patients enrolled in 2.5 years at 
61 sites represents a much higher average inclu-
sion rate per site than that in most of the current 
clinical trials involving the same population. 
Our registry was biased toward more specialized 
stroke physicians and possibly enrolled a cohort 
of patients that had characteristics that differed 
from those of patients in a population-based 
study but that probably represents patients whom 
clinical trials are recruiting. Second, owing to 
resource constraints, we were able to audit only 
10% of the data for accuracy. Although primary 
outcome events and major bleeding events were 
adjudicated, primary outcome events may have 
been underreported in the registry. For this rea-
son, our primary outcome included only hard end 
points, which are unlikely to be missed. Third, 
of 4583 patients analyzed, 4200 (91.6%) had 
1-year follow-up data available at the time of this 
analysis. The fact that data were missing for 
more than 380 patients may have partially af-
fected the 1-year event rate.
In the TIAregistry.org project, we observed a 
lower rate of cardiovascular events after a TIA or 
minor stroke than that in historical cohorts. Our 
findings probably reflect the contemporary risk 
of recurrent cardiovascular events among pa-
tients with a TIA or minor stroke who are admit-
ted to TIA clinics and who receive risk-factor 
control and antithrombotic treatment as recom-
mended by current guidelines. Although we 
found that the ABCD2 score was a good predictor 
of risk, our findings suggest that limiting urgent 
assessment to patients with a score of 4 or more 
would miss approximately 20% of those with 
early recurrent strokes. Multiple infarctions on 
neuroimaging and large-artery atherosclerotic 
disease were also strong independent predictors 
of recurrent vascular events. These results may 
help in the design and interpretation of future 
randomized trials.
