SUMMARY 289 words 
30 
Background. The optimal blood pressure (BP) target in hypertension remains debated, especially in 
31 
coronary artery disease (CAD), given concerns for reduced myocardial perfusion if diastolic BP is too 
32 
low. We studied the relationship between achieved BP and cardiovascular outcomes in CAD patients 
33 
with hypertension. 
34 
Methods. We analysed data from 22,672 patients with stable CAD enrolled (November 2009–June 
35 
2010) in the CLARIFY registry (45 countries) and treated for hypertension. Systolic and diastolic BPs 
36 
before each event were averaged and categorised into 10-mmHg increments. The primary outcome 
37 
was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Secondary outcomes 
38 
were each component of the primary outcome, all-cause death, and hospitalisation for heart failure. 
39 
Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, 
40 
using the 120–129 systolic BP and 70–79 mmHg diastolic BP subgroups as reference. 
41 
Findings. After a median follow-up of 5.0 years, elevated systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg and diastolic BP 
42 
≥80 mmHg were each associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. Systolic BP <120 
43 
mmHg was also associated with increased risk for the primary outcome (adjusted HR 1·56 [95% CI 
44 
1·36–1·81]) and all secondary outcomes except stroke. Likewise, diastolic BP <70 mmHg was 
45 
associated with an increase in the primary outcome (adjusted HR 1·41 [1·24–1·61] for diastolic BP 
46 
60–69 mmHg and 2·01 [1·50–2·70] for <60 mmHg) and in all secondary outcomes except stroke.  
47 
Interpretation. In hypertensive patients with CAD from routine clinical practice, systolic BP <120 
48 
mmHg and diastolic BP <70 mmHg were each associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, 
49 
including mortality, supporting the existence of a J-curve phenomenon. This finding suggests caution 
50 
in the use of BP-lowering treatment in CAD patients

Introduction 
55 
Lowering blood pressure (BP) in patients with hypertension reduces the risk of cardiovascular events 
56 
and death,1,2 but the optimal target BP remains unresolved.3-6 Randomised trials failed to demonstrate 
57 
a benefit of targets <140/90 mmHg,7,8 and post-hoc analyses have suggested that the benefit of BP-
58 
lowering treatment might even be reversed below a certain threshold,5,9-16 the so-called “J-curve 
59 
phenomenon”.9 Conversely, a large meta-analysis of trials that randomly assigned participants to 
60 
intensive versus less-intensive BP-lowering treatment showed that intensive BP lowering was 
61 
associated with decreased cardiovascular events, and the recent SPRINT trial18 demonstrated that 
62 
targeting a systolic BP <120 mmHg in high-risk patients was associated with a reduction in BP-related 
63 
adverse outcomes, rather favouring a “lower is better” approach. 
64 
 
These contradictory results leave clinicians with uncertainty as to the optimal BP target in 
65 
patients treated for hypertension. The concern for a J-curve phenomenon is particularly relevant for 
66 
cardiac events,10 as the heart is perfused during diastole, and its perfusion may be compromised at 
67 
low diastolic BP values, especially in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), both because a 
68 
coronary stenosis will lower perfusion pressure in the downstream territory and because 
69 
autoregulation is altered in these patients.19 Our aim was to study the association between achieved 
70 
BP levels and cardiovascular outcomes in a large cohort of patients with stable CAD treated for 
71 
hypertension from the CLARIFY registry. 
72 
 
73 
Methods 
74 
CLARIFY (ISRCTN43070564; www.clarify-registry.com) was a prospective longitudinal registry of 
75 
32,706 outpatients with stable CAD receiving standard care. The registry was observational, did not 
76 
interfere with clinical management or mandate any test, procedure, or treatment.20 Patients were 
77 
enrolled in 45 countries (excluding the United States). Eligible patients had stable CAD, defined as at 
78 
least one of the following: documented myocardial infarction >3 months before enrolment; 
79 
angiographic demonstration of coronary stenosis >50%; chest pain with evidence of myocardial 
80 
ischaemia (at least a stress electrocardiogram or preferably imaging); or coronary artery bypass graft 
81 
or percutaneous coronary intervention >3 months before enrolment. These criteria were not mutually 
82 
exclusive. Exclusion criteria were hospital admission for cardiovascular reasons (including 
83 
revascularisation) in the past 3 months, planned revascularisation, or conditions compromising the 
84 
  
4 
participation or 5-year follow-up (including severe other cardiovascular disease, e.g. advanced heart 
85 
failure, severe valve disease, history of valve repair/replacement).20 In each practice, enrolment was 
86 
restricted over a brief period to achieve near-consecutive patient recruitment. The first patient was 
87 
included on 26 November 2009; recruitment was completed on 30 June 2010. This analysis was 
88 
restricted to patients treated for hypertension (see Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
89 
Hypertension (with the usual 140/90 mmHg threshold) was defined as the combination of "treated 
90 
hypertension", which was a required item on the baseline form, and the use of at least one 
91 
antihypertensive agent at baseline. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of 
92 
Helsinki and local ethical approval was obtained in all countries. All patients gave written informed 
93 
consent.  
94 
 
95 
Data collection 
96 
The investigators completed standardised electronic case report forms at baseline and at a patient 
97 
visit every year±3 months for up to 5 years. For patients missing the yearly visit, telephone contact 
98 
with the patient, a designated relative or contact, or his/her physician was attempted. Where 
99 
applicable, registries could be used to retrieve the vital status. Several measures were implemented to 
100 
ensure data quality, including onsite monitoring visits of 100% of the data in 5% of centres selected at 
101 
random; regular telephone contact with investigators to limit missing data and loss to follow-up; and 
102 
centralised verification of the electronic case report forms for completeness, consistency, and 
103 
accuracy. At each yearly visit, symptoms, clinical examination, results of the main clinical and 
104 
biological tests, treatment and clinical outcomes were recorded. The registry was observational, with 
105 
no recommendation regarding BP management, and therefore reflects routine practice. 
106 
 
107 
BP analysis  
108 
Office BP was measured yearly in patients, after a rest of 5 minutes in the sitting position. The main 
109 
analysis was performed using the arithmetic mean of all BP values measured throughout follow-up, 
110 
from the baseline visit to the visit before an event or, in patients without an event, up to the last visit. 
111 
Outcomes were also analysed according to the baseline BP value (BP at enrolment) and to the last 
112 
measured BP before an event during follow-up. All analyses were performed for systolic BP and 
113 
diastolic BP separately. Patients were categorised into 5 groups: systolic BP <120, 120–129 
114 
  
5 
(reference), 130–139, 140–149, and ≥150 mmHg; diastolic BP <60, 60–69, 70–79 (reference), 80–89, 
115 
and ≥90 mmHg. 
116 
 
117 
Outcomes 
118 
The primary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. 
119 
Secondary outcomes were each component of the primary endpoint, all-cause death, and 
120 
hospitalisation for heart failure. For all composite outcomes, we analysed the number of patients with 
121 
at least one event from the composite outcome. Patients experiencing more than one contributing 
122 
event were counted only once. Events were accepted as reported by physicians and were not 
123 
adjudicated. However, all events were source-verified during audits. 
124 
 
125 
Statistical analysis 
126 
A Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the relationship between BP and 
127 
cardiovascular outcomes. In addition to crude HRs, adjusted HRs were estimated after adjustment for 
128 
potential confounding factors, selected using stepwise methods in the Cox proportional hazards 
129 
models, namely age, geographic region, smoking status, myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary 
130 
intervention, diabetes, body mass index, glomerular filtration rate estimated with the chronic kidney 
131 
disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, peripheral artery disease, hospitalisation for 
132 
or symptoms of heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction, stroke, transient ischaemic attack, 
133 
angiotensin-receptor blockers, diuretics, and aspirin (model 1). In a separate model, we also adjusted 
134 
for sex, coronary artery bypass grafting, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, ethnicity, 
135 
statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other 
136 
antihypertensive medications (model 2). Unless specified, all results are given for the fully adjusted 
137 
model. Data were analysed as recorded without any imputation for missing data. Adjustment variables 
138 
with a large amount of missing data were categorised including a category for missing data to 
139 
minimise the loss of data in the analysis. 
140 
 
A restricted cubic spline smoothing technique was used to interpolate the overall trend of risks 
141 
through the range of BP values. A sensitivity analysis excluding all patients with heart failure, defined 
142 
as previous hospitalisation for or symptoms of heart failure or a left ventricular ejection fraction <45%, 
143 
was also performed to ensure that results were not due to reverse causality. 
144 
  
6 
 
Interactions between average systolic or diastolic BP and the covariates age (>75 vs ≤75 
145 
years), diabetes, history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, heart failure, previous coronary 
146 
revascularisation, and chronic kidney disease (defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate 
147 
[eGFR] <60 mL/min/1·73 m2) at baseline were tested. Subgroup analyses were performed when 
148 
interactions were significant even after adjustment on the same variables as for the Cox proportional 
149 
hazards model (model 2). 
150 
 
The statistical analysis was performed using SAS (version 9.2, Cary, NC, USA), and the 
151 
restricted cubic splines were obtained using a SAS macro.21  
152

Role of the funding source 
154 
The CLARIFY registry is supported by Servier. The sponsor had no role in the study design or in data 
155 
analysis, and interpretation; or in the decision to submit the manuscript for publication, but assisted 
156 
with the set-up, data collection and management of the study in each country. The corresponding 
157 
author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit 
158 
for publication.

160 
Results 
161 
A total of 22,672 adult patients with CAD and hypertension were included in the analysis. 
162 
Demographic data and baseline characteristics of the patients, overall and for each 10-mmHg-
163 
increment BP subgroup, are given in Tables 1 and 2; baseline medications are indicated in Table S1 
164 
of the supplementary appendix. Mean age at baseline was 65·2 years (SD 10·0), 17,019 (75%) 
165 
patients were men, and 15,190 (67%) were white. Compared to patients with high systolic BP, those 
166 
with a lower systolic BP tended to be younger, leaner, more likely to be men, without diabetes, and 
167 
current smokers, with a higher baseline incidence of myocardial infarction and percutaneous coronary 
168 
intervention, a lower prevalence of stroke, and lower baseline high-density and low-density lipoprotein 
169 
cholesterol levels. Patients with lower diastolic BP tended to be older, leaner, more likely to be women, 
170 
diabetic, and non-smokers, with lower baseline levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Mean 
171 
average systolic and diastolic BPs were 133·7 (SD 16·7) and 78·2 mmHg (SD 10·1), respectively. 
172 
Changes from baseline BP during follow-up were <2 mmHg, as expected from the non-interventional 
173 
nature of the study (Figure S2 of the supplementary appendix). 
174 
  
7 
 
After a median follow-up of 5·0 years (interquartile range 4·5–5·1), 2101 patients (9·3%) met 
175 
the primary composite outcome. Cardiovascular death, all-cause death, myocardial infarction (fatal or 
176 
not), stroke (fatal or not), and hospitalisation for heart failure occurred in 1209 (5·3%), 1890 (8·3%), 
177 
827 (3·6%), 526 (2·3%), and 1306 (5·8%) patients, respectively. 
178 
 
Crude and adjusted HRs for average systolic and diastolic BP subgroups are given in Table 3. 
179 
Even after multiple adjustments for baseline cardiovascular disease, risk factors, and medication, a 
180 
steep J-shaped curve was evidenced for the occurrence of the primary outcome, with increased risk at 
181 
low and high BP values, both for systolic and diastolic BP (Figures 1 and 2). Compared with the 
182 
reference group (systolic BP 120–129), the adjusted HR for the primary outcome was 1·51 (95% CI 
183 
1·32–1·73) for systolic BP 140–149 mmHg, and 2·48 (95% CI 2·14–2·87) for systolic BP ≥150 mmHg. 
184 
Systolic BP <120 mmHg was also associated with an increased risk for the primary outcome (adjusted 
185 
HR 1·56 [95% CI 1·36–1·81]). Likewise, in comparison with a reference group of patients with diastolic 
186 
BP 70–79 mmHg, diastolic BP ≥80 mmHg was associated with an increased risk for the primary 
187 
outcome, with adjusted HRs 1·41 (1·27–1·57) for diastolic BP 80–89 mmHg and 3·72 (3·15–4·38) for 
188 
diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg; diastolic BP <70 mmHg was associated with an increase in the primary 
189 
outcome (adjusted HR 1·41 [1·24–1·61] and 2·01 [1·50–2·70] for diastolic BP 60–69 and <60 mmHg 
190 
respectively). A similar steep J-curve, for both systolic and diastolic BP, was seen for cardiovascular 
191 
death, all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and hospitalisation for heart failure, but not for stroke 
192 
(Figure 1 and Figure S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Elevated systolic and diastolic BPs were 
193 
associated with a marked increase in the risk of stroke. Adjusted HRs were 1·51 (95% CI 1·16–1·97) 
194 
and 2·57 (1·94–3·41) for systolic BP 140–149 and ≥150 mmHg, respectively. Adjusted HRs were 1·46 
195 
(1·18–1·79) and 4·33 (3·15–5·94) for diastolic BP 80–89 and ≥90 mmHg, respectively. In contrast, 
196 
there was no increased risk of stroke after the same adjustments for the lowest systolic and diastolic 
197 
BP subgroups (adjusted HRs 1·06 [0·77–1·46] for systolic BP <120 mmHg and 1·23 [0·94–1·61] and 
198 
1·31 [0·64-2·69] for diastolic BP 60–69 and <60 mmHg, respectively). The results were similar 
199 
regardless of whether the fully adjusted model included baseline medications (data not shown). Similar 
200 
results were observed in a sensitivity analysis excluding patients with heart failure at baseline (Table 
201 
3), and similar trends were obtained when using baseline BP and last BP before an event or during 
202 
follow-up (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Evaluation of the assumption of non-
203 
proportionality of the hazards in the Cox models suggested evidence that the strength of the 
204 
  
8 
differences among the BP groups in their association with outcome was slightly attenuated with 
205 
increasing time. However this does not change the overall interpretation of the results. 
206 
 
Interaction analyses are presented in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix. No significant 
207 
effect-modification of diabetes, previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack, heart failure, previous 
208 
revascularisation, or chronic kidney disease at baseline was detected on the relationship between 
209 
systolic or diastolic BP and the primary outcome. However, a significant interaction with age was seen 
210 
for both systolic (p=0·0176) and diastolic BP (p=0·0180). Patients >75 years had an increased risk of 
211 
the primary outcome for systolic BP ≥150 mmHg (adjusted HR, 1·84 [1·40–2·43]) and systolic BP 
212 
<120 mmHg (adjusted HR 1·47 [1·12–1·94]), but not for systolic BP 140–149 mmHg (adjusted HR 
213 
1·19 [0·92–1·56]), whereas patients ≤75 years had an increased risk for the primary outcome in these 
214 
three BP subgroups in comparison with the 120–129-mmHg systolic BP subgroup. For diastolic BP, 
215 
the increased risk at low BP was only significant for diastolic BP <60 mmHg in patients >75 years, 
216 
whereas it was significant as early as 70 mmHg in the younger patients (Table 3 and Figure S4 in the 
217 
Supplementary Appendix). 
218 
 
219 
Discussion 
220 
This observational study, conducted in “real-life” stable CAD patients treated for hypertension, shows 
221 
that low systolic (<120 mmHg) and low diastolic (<70 mmHg) BPs are associated with an increased 
222 
risk of cardiovascular events, with a steep J-curve not only for the composite of cardiovascular death, 
223 
myocardial infarction, or stroke, but also separately for cardiovascular death, all-cause death, 
224 
myocardial infarction, or hospitalisation for heart failure.  
225 
 
Our results are consistent with previous post-hoc analyses from randomised trials in patients 
226 
with hypertension and CAD.10,12,19 Likewise, a J-curve (i.e. an increase in risk of cardiovascular events 
227 
below a certain BP level) has also been described in other high-risk populations, such as patients with 
228 
a previous cardiovascular event, or diabetes with target organ damage.14,15 However, our study was 
229 
based on a large cohort from routine practice with no predefined BP intervention, which may confound 
230 
the analysis: any retrospective analysis of a BP-intervention trial will carry the bias of baseline BP, 
231 
which will differ between the groups defined by BP achieved during the trial. Additionally, the J-curve 
232 
phenomenon was robust and persisted after multiple adjustment procedures for potential confounders. 
233 
  
9 
 
Previous observational studies have yielded conflicting results regarding the risk of stroke, 
234 
which was J-shaped with systolic BP in the post-hoc analysis of patients with previous stroke from the 
235 
PRoFESS trial22 and was unaffected by the large decrease in systolic BP in the SPRINT trial,18 but 
236 
decreased with decreasing diastolic or systolic BP with no evidence of a J-curve inflection in other 
237 
trials.10-12,15 In our study, neither a low diastolic nor a low systolic BP was associated with increased 
238 
risk of stroke, in contrast with high systolic or diastolic BP, and no interaction between BP and 
239 
previous stroke was evidenced. The number of patients with a stroke was, however, smaller than that 
240 
for other endpoints. 
241 
 
In the debate about the J-curve concept, there is a concern for “reverse causality” (i.e. a low 
242 
systolic or diastolic BP may only be a marker of poor health rather than the cause of worse clinical 
243 
outcomes).5,6,23 For instance, in patients with baseline systolic BP <130 mmHg from the ONTARGET 
244 
trial, Redon et al demonstrated that patients who had a cardiovascular event during follow-up had a 
245 
higher baseline risk but similar on-treatment BP reduction compared with those who did not have an 
246 
event, suggesting that the occurrence of cardiovascular events may be related to baseline vascular 
247 
disease rather than to an excessive BP reduction.15 However, several lines of evidence argue against 
248 
this explanation for our findings. First, serious non-cardiovascular disease, conditions interfering with 
249 
life expectancy (e.g. cancer, drug abuse) and other severe cardiovascular disease (e.g. advanced 
250 
heart failure, severe valve disease, or history of valve repair/replacement) were exclusion criteria in 
251 
CLARIFY. Second, the association between low systolic and diastolic BP and increased risk was 
252 
robust and persisted throughout multiple adjustments, including adjusting for peripheral artery disease, 
253 
heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction, and baseline medications, and also in a sensitivity 
254 
analysis excluding patients with heart failure. Finally, there was no association between low BP and 
255 
stroke. Altogether, these points strongly argue against reverse causality, but rather are in favour of a 
256 
direct deleterious effect of low BP on cardiovascular events. 
257 
 
A particular strength of our study is that it includes a large international cohort of patients, 
258 
treated in “real-life” conditions. Results from this broad representative cohort may have greater 
259 
external validity than the highly selected populations from randomised trials.24 There is a concern that 
260 
low BP goals from randomised trials, when translated into routine practice, may be associated with 
261 
higher adverse effects or worse outcomes, especially in older patients.3,25  
262 
  
10 
 
In light of discrepant results of tight BP control trials in patients with diabetes7 or stroke8 versus 
263 
neither of these conditions,18 we examined interactions between BP lowering and these conditions and 
264 
found none, which is consistent with previous observations.10,12,15 However, we found an interaction 
265 
between both systolic and diastolic BP and age. Interestingly, the J-curve for systolic BP was shifted to 
266 
the right in patients >75 years, which is in agreement with international guidelines, which advocate for 
267 
a higher target systolic BP of 150 mmHg in older patients.26  
268 
 
The SPRINT trial and a recent meta-analysis appeared to argue against a J-curve 
269 
phenomenon.17,18 However, our observations are not inconsistent with their findings. In the recent 
270 
meta-analysis of more versus less intensive BP treatment, which included relatively old studies,17 the 
271 
BP level reached in the more intensive BP-lowering treatment group was 133/76 mmHg vs 140/81 
272 
mmHg in the less intensive treatment group, so that the “strict control” BP arm remains clearly above 
273 
the potentially harmful thresholds we observed. Our results are also consistent with the SPRINT trial, 
274 
even though the BP reached in the intensive treatment group was fairly low (121·4/68·7 vs 136·2/76·3 
275 
mmHg in the standard treatment group), as unlike other BP intervention trials, the BP values in 
276 
SPRINT were measured under unattended conditions to minimise any white coat effect,18 but may 
277 
underestimate casual BP values by at least 5–10 mmHg,25 or up to 16 mmHg.27 This actually led 
278 
hypertension experts to warn that the SPRINT target translated into community practice may have 
279 
deleterious effects3,25 because the same targets obtained in routine practice would potentially lie within 
280 
the left part of the J-curve. Our results, which demonstrate a J-curve in patients with casual BP 
281 
measurements with harmful thresholds very close to the achieved BP obtained in the intensive arm of 
282 
SPRINT, indeed support this word of caution.  
283 
 
Our observations are in agreement with the fact that after decades of hypertension trials,1,2 the 
284 
benefit of lowering BP <140 mmHg remains unquestionable, whereas the benefit of lowering BP to 
285 
<130 mmHg is uncertain.7,8,13 These findings are in keeping with the HOPE-3 trial results in which 
286 
lowering BP was only beneficial when baseline BP was >140/90,28 and with a meta-analysis of 
287 
randomised trials showing benefit of BP lowering only when systolic BP was >140 mmHg.29 For 
288 
diastolic BP, a target <90 mmHg is undoubtedly beneficial,1,30 but there is more uncertainty below this 
289 
threshold. Our study shows that a diastolic BP of 70–79 mmHg is associated with a better outcome 
290 
than a diastolic BP ≥80 mmHg, consistent with the SPRINT trial results,18 but also strongly argues 
291 
against further lowering BP <70 mmHg. 
292 
  
11 
 
Our results only apply to hypertensive patients with CAD and should not be extrapolated to 
293 
hypertensive patients with other conditions. Compared with post-hoc analyses of BP-lowering trials, 
294 
there are some disadvantages to using data from an observational registry, such as the open nature of 
295 
the information (including events), the possible lower accuracy of outcome identification, and the 
296 
greater heterogeneity of the treatment employed. In addition, the casual BP values from our study are 
297 
less accurate and standardised than in randomised trials or than BP values obtained from ambulatory 
298 
measurements; on the other hand, they are also more readily applicable to community practice. Also, 
299 
these observations derive from an observational study and are prone to confounding. Only dedicated 
300 
randomised controlled trials comparing BP targets can provide definitive evidence of the risk 
301 
associated with each BP threshold. In particular, our results call for specific trials to address whether 
302 
patients with a SBP >140 mmHg and a high pulse pressure should be treated with the goal of a 
303 
systolic BP <140 mmHg, even at the cost of a diastolic BP <70 mmHg, and whether the answer to that 
304 
question is different depending on the presence of CAD, a history of stroke, diabetes, or advanced 
305 
age.  
306 
 
In conclusion, this large observational international study shows that high but also low systolic 
307 
BP and diastolic BP levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events in CAD 
308 
patients with hypertension. The increased risk appears under a threshold of 120 mmHg for systolic BP 
309 
and 70 mmHg for diastolic BP. However, these observations should not slow down the constant effort 
310 
that is still necessary to improve patient care, as even with the conventional BP goal of <140/90 
311 
mmHg, only about half of the hypertensive population is controlled.31

Research in context 
437 
Evidence before this study 
438 
We systematically searched PubMed without date or language restriction with the terms “J-curve”, 
439 
“blood pressure OR hypertension”, “Blood pressure target”, “tight blood pressure control”, ”SPRINT”, 
440 
“coronary artery disease” and synonyms or various combinations of those words to identify systematic 
441 
reviews, observational studies, randomised controlled trials, and meta-analysis describing the 
442 
relationship between achieved blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular events and/or mortality, with a 
443 
last update in July 2016. We screened papers by title and abstract and title and full text in editorials to 
444 
identify articles relevant for the study aim. We also screened cited papers from the full-texts of these 
445 
articles for other relevant research. When restricting the search to original studies including only 
446 
patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), with a minimum of 500 patients, we identified post-hoc 
447 
analyses of three trials (INVEST, n=22,576; TNT, n=10,001; and ACTION, n=7,665), and no 
448 
observational study or randomised controlled trial devoted prospectively to explore the J-curve. Other 
449 
studies were based on BP trials that included subgroups of patients with CAD (ONTARGET, n=19,102 
450 
of 25,620 patients; VALUE, n=6981 of 15,244 patients; Syst-Eur, n=681 of 4695 patients; and HOT, 
451 
n=3080 of 18,790 patients). The papers cited in this article were selected to be representative of the 
452 
existing evidence both in patients with CAD and other populations, and reviews from before and after 
453 
the publication of the SPRINT trial are referenced. 
454 
 
Overall, although the benefits of BP-lowering treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular 
455 
disease and death in hypertensive patients were well established, the results of the studies derived 
456 
from these trials were conflicting regarding the existence of a “J-curve” or a threshold of achieved 
457 
systolic and diastolic BP within the physiological range under which antihypertensive treatment may be 
458 
harmful. 
459 
Added value of the study 
460 
In this contemporary international observational study in 22,672 hypertensive patients with CAD using 
461 
casual BP measurements, and in which there was no pre-specified intervention on BP, there was a 
462 
clear J-curve phenomenon. Achieved systolic BP <120 mmHg and achieved diastolic BP <70 mmHg 
463 
were both associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality, independently of 
464 
potential confounding factors.  
465 
Implications of all the available evidence 
466 
  
17 
Together with previous literature, our study suggests caution when treating CAD patients with 
467 
antihypertensive drugs. Future randomised controlled trials will be necessary to confirm the cut-off BP 
468 
value below which harm outweighs benefit in this population.

Data are indicated for the whole population and for the sensitivity analysis excluding patients with heart failure for all outcomes. Data are also given by age 
subgroup (≤75 years or >75 years) for the primary outcome. BP=blood pressure. The p-value reported represents the heterogeneity of the association of BP 
with each outcome across the BP categories.

Model 1: adjusted for age, geographical region, smoking status, myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary Intervention, diabetes, body mass index, 
glomerular filtration rate, peripheral artery disease, hospitalisation for or symptoms of heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction, stroke, transient ischaemic 
attack, angiotensin-receptor blockers, diuretics and aspirin. 
Model 2: adjusted for age, sex, geographical region, smoking status, myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary Intervention, coronary artery bypass graft, 
diabetes, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, body mass index, glomerular filtration rate, peripheral artery disease, hospitalisation for or 
symptoms of heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction, ethnicity, stroke, transient ischaemic attack and baseline medications, namely aspirin, statins, 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics and other antihypertensive 
medications.
