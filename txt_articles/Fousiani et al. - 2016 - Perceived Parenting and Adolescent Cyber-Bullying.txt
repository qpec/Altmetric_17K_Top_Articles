Abstract
Due to the progress in information technology,
cyber-bullying is becoming one of the most common forms
of interpersonal harm, especially among teenagers. The
present study (N = 548) aimed to investigate the relation
between perceived parenting style (in terms of autonomy
support and psychological control) and cyber-bullying in
adolescence. Thereby, the study tested for the intervening
role of adolescent need satisfaction (i.e., autonomy and
relatedness), empathic concern towards others, and ado-
lescents’ recognition of full humanness to cyber-bullying
offenders and victims. Findings revealed both a direct and
an indirect relation between parenting and cyber-bullying.
More specifically, parental psychological control directly
predicted cyber-bullying, whereas parental autonomy sup-
port related to less cyber-bullying indirectly, as it was
associated with the satisfaction of adolescents’ need for
autonomy,
which
predicted
more
empathic
concern
towards others, which in turn differentially related to
recognition of humanness to victims and bullies. The dis-
cussion focuses on the implications of the current findings.

Introduction
Cyber-bulling constitutes a common problem in adoles-
cence, as a meaningful proportion of teenagers is involved
in such experiences. Cyber-bullying can be defined as the
aggressive and intentionally repeated act conducted by an
individual or a group of individuals using technology for
electronic contact against a victim (Smith et al. 2008). It
includes every experience with any form of online
harassment and may impact its victims on various levels
(e.g., psychological, emotional, social, etc.; Hinduja and
Patchin 2009).
Although cyber-bullying and traditional bullying are
taking place on a different and unique venue, there gen-
erally is a consensus among researchers that they function
in
quite
similar
ways,
including
the
aggressiveness
characterizing online and offline bullying, and the imbal-
ance of physical, social, relational, or psychological power
between bully and victim. Further, the behavior is repeat-
edly displayed, with the intention to harm another indi-
vidual (Olweus 2013). In addition, research has shown that
individuals involved in traditional bullying also often get
involved in cyber-harassment (Hemphill et al. 2012). These
similarities have led researchers to suggest that cyber-
bullying and traditional bullying are closely related,
pointing out that electronic media is another medium
through which individuals who already aggress offline, can
now aggress online as well (Werner et al. 2010).
However, cyberbullying is characterized by certain
unique features as well (Dooley et al. 2009), such as the

 possible anonymity of the offender and the distancing
effect that technological devices ensure, rendering cyber-
bullies more unaware about the consequences of their
behaviors—a fact that, in turn, may reduce potential
empathy towards their victims. This may explain why
cyberbullies may treat their victims in an even harsher way
than typical face-to-face bullies. Moreover, given how fast
and how widespread such harmful material against cyber-
bullying victims can be shared through mobile phones and
through the Internet, the group effect constitutes a further
aspect of cyberbullying that may render this form of bul-
lying as more distressful and damaging for the victim (see
Dooley et al. 2009, for a review). For the above reasons, we
viewed cyberbullying as a more crucial form of bullying in
the modern society, and thus, we focused on this form
rather than traditional bullying.
Numerous studies have revealed the important role of
the parenting context for understanding the development of
bullying and victimization. For instance, bullies often
describe their family as authoritarian and less organized,
whereas victims rather view their parents as highly per-
missive (Baldry and Farrington 2000). Similarly, cyber-
bullying offenders often report experiencing limited par-
ental monitoring, stronger parental discipline and a weaker
emotional bond with their parents, as compared to those
not engaging in cyber-bullying (Wang et al. 2009). Herein,
we focused specifically on two parenting dimensions that
gained relatively less empirical attention, that is, parental
autonomy support (AS) and psychological control (PC).
Parental AS is defined as the promotion of youngsters’
volitional functioning, in which case parents are empathic
towards the
adolescent’s perspective, provide
choice
whenever possible, and provide a meaningful rationale
when choice is limited (Grolnick 2003; Soenens et al.
2007). By doing so, parents encourage their children to
make self-endorsed decisions and choices that reflect their
internalized values, preferences and interests (e.g., Fou-
siani et al. 2014). Parental PC, on the other hand, involves
the use of manipulative and coercive tactics such as love
withdrawal, instilling anxiety, guilt induction and invali-
dation of the child’s perspective (Barber and Harmon 2002;
Soenens and Vansteenkiste 2010). Several studies among
adolescents have shown that parental AS relates to higher
psychosocial adjustment, whereas PC is associated with
maladjustment and psychopathology (for a review, see
Soenens and Vansteenkiste 2010). In addition, children of
highly psychologically controlling parents also would
engage
more
often
in
manipulative
and
relationally
aggressive behaviors such as gossiping, damaging other
people’s social reputation and threatening to end a friend-
ship (e.g., Soenens et al. 2008), behaviors that are common
to cyber-bullying offending. In a similar vein, studies that
confirmed the associations between (autonomy-supportive
versus controlling) teaching practices and bullying and
violence also offer indirect evidence for the relevance of
parental AS (vs. PC) for understanding adolescent cyber-
bullying (Hein et al. 2015; Roth et al. 2011).
According to Self-Determination Theory (Ryan and
Deci 2000; Soenens and Vansteenkiste 2010), the benefi-
cial (vs. detrimental) correlates of parental AS (vs. PC) can
be explained by adolescents’ perceived satisfaction (vs.
frustration) of their basic psychological needs for auton-
omy, relatedness and competence, which would be essen-
tial for an entity’s growth and healthy development (Ryan
1995). Thereby, the need for autonomy implies that people
have a natural desire to experience their behavior as voli-
tional and personally relevant (Deci and Ryan 1985). Re-
latedness implies that people want to care for others and to
feel cared by them (Ryan 1995). Finally, competence refers
to one’s desire to feel effective and skillful in the activities
one undertakes (Ryan 1995). A growing body of research
points to the explanatory role of adolescents’ need satis-
faction in the relation between perceived parental AS and
PC, and adolescents’ adjustment. The more parents are
perceived as autonomy-supportive, the more children feel
self-determined
and
autonomous,
experience
positive
relations, and feel more effective in their actions, which
predicts higher well-being, whereas the opposite is true for
PC (e.g., Ahmad et al. 2013; Inguglia et al. 2015).
Although no research to date explicitly tested the role
of need satisfaction in cyber-bullying/victimization mat-
ters, there is evidence that need satisfaction, and the sat-
isfaction of autonomy and relatedness in particular,
relates to antisocial and aggressive behavior. Weinstein
et al. (2011), for instance, found that low autonomy is
associated with the enjoyment of hostile humor, whereas
Van Petegem et al. (2015) provided evidence for the
explanatory role of autonomy frustration in the relation
between parental PC and externalizing symptoms. As far
as relatedness is concerned, Park et al. (2011) found that
relatedness was associated with more altruism, whereas
Miklikowska et al. (2011) found support for the longitu-
dinal relation between perceived need-supportive parent-
ing and empathy among adolescents. However, contrary
to need for autonomy and relatedness, there is less evi-
dence that general competence satisfaction would relate to
either aggression or bullying (for exceptions, see the work
on specific competences, such as social competence,
Irshad and Atta 2013, and moral competence, Gasser and
Keller 2009).
Another major element of bullying behavior that may be
relevant is the power imbalance between the parties
involved (Olweus 2013). Power imbalance often involves
the perceived superiority of harm-doers and inferiority of
those being harmed. In that respect, perceived superiority
versus inferiority also may pertain to recognition of human

 essence to each party involved in bullying, where human
essence refers to the elements that distinguish people from
animals or objects rendering humans superior (see e.g.,
Haslam 2006). Literature indicates that oppression or
marginalization of humans may be rooted in the human-
animal or even human-object division, where marginalized
or oppressed groups are seen as less-than-human (Living-
stone-Smith 2011). Among children, there is limited
research evidence linking anti-social behavior and bullying
with such dehumanizing practices against victims (Costello
and Hodson 2012; van Noorden et al. 2014).
According to the existing literature, harm-doers would be
enabled to commit horrible acts through a denial of the
others’ humanness, a core dimension of the well-known
‘‘moral disengagement’’ phenomenon. Moral disengagement
is the process by which people convince themselves that
detrimental conduct directed toward individuals is morally
acceptable by converting harmful acts to moral ones through
linkage to worthy purposes (Bandura 1986; Obermann
2011). In social psychology, dehumanization theory (see
Haslam 2006) has been used frequently for explaining
aggressive and violent behaviors against individuals or
groups. Two types of human characteristics can be distin-
guished to individuals: (a) uniquely human (UH) charac-
teristics (e.g., civility, morality, rationality) are the ones
distinguishing humans from animals and they involve high-
order cognition. Denial of this kind of traits to individuals is
called animalistic dehumanization (Haslam 2006) and it
involves categorization of others as inferior beings, hence
justifying aggressive or violent behaviors against others;
(b) human nature (HN) characteristics (e.g., emotional
responsiveness, cognitive openness) distinguish people from
machines or automata. Denial of these characteristics is
called mechanistic dehumanization (Haslam 2006) and it
involves viewing the others as emotionally cold, close-
minded and passive just like objects and it serves in treating
them with psychological distance or indifference.
Interestingly, it seems that denial of UH or HN charac-
teristics to the others could be related to experiences of
autonomy and relatedness frustration. We are aware of only
one study to date that has revealed the explanatory role of
denial of HN traits to others in the relation between auton-
omy frustration and interpersonal violence and aggression
(Moller and Deci 2010). However, denial of humanness to
others also is linked to decreased empathic skills of harm-
doers, whereas empathy is considered as a requirement for
overcoming dehumanization (Halpern and Weinstein 2004).
According to the literature, empathy encompasses two
dimensions: (a) an affective dimension, often referred to as
empathic concern, which represents the ability to experience
another’s emotions; and (b) a cognitive dimension, often
referred to as perspective taking, which reflects the ability to
understand another person’s emotional state (Gini 2006).
Several studies, measuring both kinds of empathy, revealed
the significance of affective over cognitive empathy in
bullying/victimization contexts (Stavrinides et al. 2010).
Therefore, in this study we focused on adolescents’ capacity
for empathic concern. Moreover, as for the association with
recognition of humanness to the others, Capozza et al.
(2013) and C
ˇ ehajic
´ et al. (2009) revealed that, when people
do recognize uniquely human emotions to victims, they
experience more empathy towards them.
The present study tests for the relation between perceived
parental AS and PC and adolescents’ involvement in cyber-
bullying. Thereby, we tested for the intervening role of
adolescents’ need satisfaction (in terms of autonomy and
relatedness), empathic concern, and their inclination to rec-
ognize humanness to both bullies and victims. We hypoth-
esized that perceived parental AS (as opposed to PC) would
relate to less cyber-bullying, both directly and indirectly
through need satisfaction and empathic concern. In addition,
it was expected high empathy would relate to the recognition
of full humanness to victims and to decreased recognition of
humanness to bullies. High recognition of humanness to
victims and low recognition to bullies, in turn, would be
associated with lower levels of cyber-bullying. Furthermore,
it was hypothesized that UH characteristics would play a
more significant role in cyber-bullying as compared to HN
characteristics, as UH characteristics especially would be
related to moral disengagement (Haslam 2006).
Method
Participants
The sample was composed of 548 high school (Grades
10–11) students (48.2 % male) from 11 schools in Nicosia,
the capital of Cyprus. 61.2 % were from the first class of
high school, 38.8 % from the second class and 0.2 % from
the third class. Respondents came from intact (77.4 %),
divorced
(16.1 %)
or
single-parent
(6.5 %)
families.
95.4 % of the students were connected on a social network
(e.g., Facebook, Twitter). Participation in the study was
voluntary and anonymity was guaranteed. Participants’
socio-economic status (SES) was not explicitly measured,
but given that the sample consisted of adolescents from
various districts of the capital of Cyprus, it is likely that the
sample strongly varied in terms of SES.
Procedure
Questionnaires were administered during a regular class
period at school. The study procedure was in line with the
criteria set by Cyprus authorities and with the regulations
about
ethical
issues.
Specifically,
a

 obtained by the Cyprus Ministry of Education and Culture
as well as the Pedagogical Institute of Cyprus, which is
responsible for research affairs in schools in Cyprus.
Measures
Greek versions of the parenting scales already have been
used successfully in Greek samples in prior research
(Fousiani et al. 2014). To the best of our knowledge, the
other scales have not been used in a Greek-speaking
sample before, and thus were translated into Greek by the
authors through the same procedure as with the parenting
scales, that is, a translation-back translation procedure.
Perceived Parental Autonomy Support (AS)
Parental AS was measured through the Autonomy Support
subscale of the Perceptions of Parenting Scale (POPS;
Grolnick et al. 1991). This questionnaire consists of seven
items (e.g., ‘‘whenever possible, my mother allows me to
choose what to do.’’). Items were rated only for mothers.
Participants answered on a 7-point Likert-type scale,
ranging from 1 (‘‘not at all true’’) to 7 (‘‘absolutely true’’).
Extensive validity information of the scale is provided by
Soenens et al. (2007). The psychometric characteristics of
the Greek version of the scale had been found to be sat-
isfactory as well (Fousiani et al. 2014). In the present study,
Cronbach’s a was .84.
Perceived Parental Psychological Control (PC)
Respondents completed the 8-item Psychological Control
Scale-Youth Self Report (Barber 1996; e.g., ‘‘my mother is
always trying to change how I feel or think about things’’)
for the assessment of maternal PC. Participants answered
on a 7-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (‘‘not at all
true’’) to 7 (‘‘absolutely true’’). In the present study,
Cronbach’s a was .79.
Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction
To assess basic psychological need satisfaction, we used
two subscales from the Basic Psychological Need Satis-
faction and Need Frustration Scale (BPNSNFS; Chen et al.
2015). Autonomy need satisfaction was measured through
eight items, of which four items assessing autonomy sat-
isfaction (i.e., ‘‘I feel a sense of choice and freedom in the
things I undertake’’) and four items assessing autonomy
frustration (i.e., ‘‘I feel forced to do many things I wouldn’t
choose to do’’). Likewise, relatedness satisfaction was
assessed through eight items as well, of which four items
measuring relatedness satisfaction (i.e., ‘‘I feel that the
people I care about also care about me’’) and four items
measuring relatedness frustration (i.e., ‘‘I feel that people
who are important to me are cold and distant towards me’’).
Participants responded on a scale from 1 (‘‘not at all true’’)
to 7 (‘‘absolutely true’’). Extensive validation information
about the cross-cultural applicability of the BPNSNFS is
provided by Chen et al. (2015). Cronbach’s a were .75 for
autonomy satisfaction, .65 for autonomy frustration, .80 for
relatedness satisfaction and .76 for relatedness frustration.
Recognition of Humanness to Bullies and Victims
Participants rated four items for the assessment of recog-
nition of uniquely human (UH) traits of bullies and the
same four items for recognition of UH traits of victims;
three items were administered for the assessment of
recognition of human nature (HN) traits of victims and of
bullies (Bastian and Haslam 2010; Haslam 2006). Both
scales were administered separately for bullies and victims.
Examples items are ‘‘bullies/victims are rational and logi-
cal’’ (recognition of UH) and ‘‘bullies/victims are emo-
tional,
responsive
and
warm
in
their
interpersonal
relations’’ (recognition of HN). Responses were given from
1 ‘‘strongly disagree’’ to 7 ‘‘strongly agree’’. One item was
dropped for recognition of HN traits of victims after scale
analyses. Cronbach’s a were .81 and .80 for bullies’ UH
and HN trait scales respectively, and .83 and .77 for vic-
tims’ UH and HN traits scales respectively.
Cyber-Bullying Offending
The well-validated 5-item cyber-bullying scale (Hinduja
and Patchin 2009) was used for the assessment of cyber-
bullying offending. Questions assessed the frequency of
cyber-bullying offending behaviors (e.g., In the last
30 days,… ‘‘…I have posted something online about
another person to make others laugh’’, ‘‘…I have sent
someone a computer text message to make them angry or
to make fun with them’’). Responses were rated on a
7-point scale (from 1 ‘‘never’’, to 7 ‘‘very often’’), with
higher scores indicating more frequent offending behav-
iors. Cronbach’s a was .86.
Empathic Concern
The 7-item Empathic concern (EC) subscale of the
Empathy Scale (Davis 1983) was used to assess ‘‘other-
oriented’’ feelings of sympathy and concern for unfortunate
others. Questions were rated on a 7-point Likert scale
ranging from 1 (‘‘does not describe me at all’’) to 7 (‘‘de-
scribes me very well’’). This often-used questionnaire has
been found to be valid and reliable in previous research
J Child Fam Stud (2016) 25:2120–2129
2123
123
 (e.g., Miklikowska et al. 2011). In the present study,
Cronbachs’ a of the scale was .70.
Data Analyses
A full latent structural equation model was employed to
investigate the hypotheses of the study. The covariance
matrix of all items was analyzed using maximum likeli-
hood estimation in AMOS 20. Prior to examining the
structural models, a series of measurement models were
analysed for the formulation of the latent variables. Per-
ceived parental Autonomy Support (AS) and Psychological
Control (PC) served as exogenous, correlated, latent vari-
ables; the former was modeled on five reflective indicators
from the AS-subscale of the POPS and the latter was
modelled on eight reflective indicators of the Psychological
Control Scale-Youth Self Report. Autonomy and Related-
ness needs were modelled as correlated, endogenous, sec-
ond-order variables. A Satisfaction and a Frustration first-
order factor loaded on each of the two basic needs vari-
ables. Each Satisfaction and each Frustration variable
comprised of four items from the BPNSNFS. Empathic
Concern was an endogenous variable consisting of seven
empathic concern items from the Empathy scale. Human
Nature and Human Uniqueness of bullies were allowed to
correlate and consisted of three and four items, respec-
tively. Human nature and Human uniqueness of victims
were allowed to correlate and consisted of two and four
items respectively. Cyber-Bullying, an endogenous vari-
able, consisted of five items obtained from the Cyber-
Bullying Offending Scale.
A sequence of three fully latent structural equation
models were then tested: Model 1 included AS and PC as
exogenous predictors for Autonomy and Relatedness fac-
tors. All four factors were used as predictors of Cyber-
Bullying. For Model 2, the Empathic Concern factor was
added as an intervening variable between Autonomy and
Relatedness factors and Cyber-Bullying. Finally, Model 3
introduced the four humanness factors as intervening
variables between Empathic Concern and Cyber-bullying.
At each stage, model fit was assessed and non-significant
paths were deleted before moving to the subsequent model.
Overall model fit was evaluated with the v2-statistic.
However, because this statistic is sensitive to sample size
and may overestimate the lack of model fit, the following
goodness-of-fit indices were also examined: the Compara-
tive Fit Index (CFI), the Standardized Root Mean square
Residual (SRMR), and the Root Mean Square Error of
Approximation (RMSEA), along with a 90 % confidence
interval. Values .90 or higher for CFI, less than .08 for
SRMR and less than .05 for RMSEA were taken as evidence
of adequate fit between a hypothesized model and the data.
Results
Means, standard deviations and correlation coefficients
among all variables in the study appear in Table 1. The
participants reported relatively high average scores on
autonomy support, autonomy and relatedness satisfaction,
and empathic concern. Average scores for psychological
control, relatedness frustration, human uniqueness and
nature of bullies and cyber-bullying were rather low.
Correlation coefficients generally were in the expected
direction. Cyber-bullying in particular related positively to
psychological control, autonomy and relatedness frustra-
tion, and recognition of human characteristics to bullies; it
related negatively to relatedness satisfaction, empathic
concern and recognition of human uniqueness to victims.
The first model was specified with AS and PC as pre-
dictors of Cyber-bullying. Autonomy and Relatedness were
also included as intervening variables between the parenting
variables and Cyber-bullying. After removing the non-
significant
paths,
the
fit
of
the
model
was
accept-
able (v2
ð510Þ = 957.021, p \.001, CFI = .929, RMSEA =
.040, 90 % CI [.036–044], SRMR = .055), and is depicted in
Fig. 1. AS was not significantly related to cyber-bullying,
but significantly related to more autonomy satisfaction and
relatedness satisfaction, with a particularly strong relation
with autonomy. PC had a small to moderate negative asso-
ciation with the needs variables, and a small positive relation
with cyber-bullying. Autonomy and relatedness were not
significantly related to cyber-bullying.
Next, empathic concern was entered in the analysis.
Paths from autonomy and relatedness were specified on
empathic concern, and a path from the latter on cyber-
bullying. The analysis resulted in a non-positive definite
matrix; an inadmissible correlation estimate was found
between the disturbances of the first-order factors of
autonomy satisfaction and relatedness satisfaction. In a test
of critical ratios for differences in Model 1, the two dis-
turbances were found to be not significantly different.
Constraining them to be equal led to an admissible solu-
tion. Non-significant path estimates were removed and the
resulting model had an acceptable fit: v2

Þ = 1435.449,
p \ .001, CFI = .906, RMSEA = .040, 90 % CI [.037–
.044], SRMR = .062. In this model (Fig. 2), AS had sig-
nificant path coefficients on the needs variables. The
coefficient from PC on autonomy was non-significant and
those on relatedness and cyber-bullying were significant
but slightly lower in magnitude compared to Model 1.
Empathic concern was associated positively with Auton-
omy, but not with Relatedness. Empathic concern, in turn,
predicted less Cyber-bullying.
Subsequently,
four
latent
factors
representing
the
humanness variables were introduced as well. Paths from
2124

 empathic concern on the humanness variables, and from the
humanness variables on cyber-bullying were added. After
removing
non-significant
paths,
the

(Fig. 3) had the following fit indices: v2

Þ = 2408.293,
p \ .001, CFI = .901, RMSEA = .038, 90 % CI [.035–
.040], SRMR = .065. Compared to Model 2, the regression
estimates from the parenting variables to the needs factors
and on Empathic concern were similar. The direct effect
from empathic concern on cyber-bullying was no longer
significant, though the former had significant path coeffi-
cients on all four humanness variables. Specifically,
empathic concern related to less humanness attributed to
bullies and more humanness attributed to victims. Relations
with human uniqueness appeared to be stronger than with the
human nature factors for both bullies and victims. Further,
cyber-bullying related positively to human uniqueness of
bullies and negatively to human uniqueness of victims.
Discussion
Currently, cyber-bullying constitutes one of the most com-
mon forms of interpersonal harm among teenagers with
increasingly serious
social and
personal ramifications
(Smith et al. 2008). However, factors contributing to the
manifestation of such aggressive behaviors among adoles-
cents on cyberspace still remain largely unexplored. The
major focus of this study lies in the holistic consideration of
this topic taking into account both parental as well as ado-
lescent factors, trying to test both their direct and indirect
relations with cyber-bullying. More specifically, this study
had two major goals, that is (a) exploring the direct relations
between perceived parental autonomy support and psycho-
logical control, and cyber-bullying among adolescents, and
(b) investigating the possible intervening role of a number of
variables, namely, adolescents’ autonomy and relatedness
need satisfaction, empathic concern towards others, and
recognition of humanness to both bullies and victims.
As for the first goal of the study, past research has
systematically indicated the importance of autonomy sup-
port in youngsters’ pro-social stance (e.g., Miklikowska
et al. 2011; Roth et al. 2011); the current findings mani-
fested a positive direct relation between perceived parental
psychological control and cyber-bullying. In addition, the
findings obtained in this study reveal an indirect relation
between perceived parental autonomy support and cyber-
bullying. Specifically, autonomy support related positively
to the satisfaction of adolescents’ need for relatedness and
autonomy. In turn, when the need for autonomy was sat-
isfied adolescents reported higher capacities in responding
to the others’ emotions, which in turn related to their
capacity to recognize civilized and moral individuals and
thus delegitimize harm-doers (i.e., bullies).

 Thereby, empathic concern differentially related to
adolescents’ recognitions of humanness to bullies and
victims. Specifically, it related positively to recognition of
both human uniqueness and human nature traits to the
victims (i.e., humanization of the victims) and negatively
to the recognition of both types of humanness to bullies
(i.e., dehumanization of bullies). Such findings are in
accordance with Gini’s (2006) study which showed that
bullies display significant deficiencies with respect to
moral sentiments and caring, and higher levels of moral
disengagement. In a similar vein, recent research has
revealed a positive association between bullying behavior
among adolescents and callous-unemotional traits, namely,
lack of guilt, lack of empathy, and uncaring (Viding et al.
2009). Interestingly, although empathic concern predicted
both human uniqueness and human nature characteristics,
only human uniqueness characteristics were related to
cyber-bullying behavior. These results are consistent with
the literature, as denial of human uniqueness traits is
related to disgust to others, humiliating treatment, moral

 disengagement and delegitimization of others, whereas
denial of human nature traits is mostly associated with
indifference to others and psychological distance (for a
review see Haslam 2006; Haslam and Loughnan 2014). In
line with our findings, van Noorden et al.’s (2014) study
has demonstrated the importance of animalistic dehuman-
ization (i.e., denial of human uniqueness)—but not mech-
anistic dehumanization (i.e., denial of human nature)—in
bullying situations.
Contrary to our expectations, the need for relatedness
did not relate to cyber-bullying, neither directly nor indi-
rectly. Although bullying at a first glance would refer to
relatedness issues, as it involves violence and aggression
between individuals or groups, the findings of the current
study seem to suggest that the frustration of need for
autonomy especially has a stronger association with cyber-
bullying. A number of other studies indirectly support our
findings that especially autonomy frustration is important
for understanding anti-social behaviors. For instance, when
people feel that their autonomy has been thwarted, they
often respond in a more anti-social manner involving
increased anger and aggression (Neighbors et al. 2002),
social dominance and racial prejudice (Duriez et al. 2007).
On the contrary, when the need for autonomy is satisfied
more pro-social attitudes and behaviors (Gagne 2003) and
less moral disengagement (Mask et al. 2005) are displayed.
Possibly, relatedness frustration may be more closely
linked to more internalizing types of problems. Indeed,
previous studies on loneliness (which may be indicative of
relatedness frustration) especially documented associations
with internalizing problems, including anxiety, depression,
and suicidal ideation (Ernst and Cacioppo 1999; Heinrich
and Gullone 2006). However, future research is crucial in
order to further test these hypotheses more in-depth.
Limitations and Future Research
This study has a number of important limitations that
should be noted. First, the use of self-report instruments for
the assessment of perceived parental autonomy support
versus psychological control may have led to an over-es-
timation of the association between perceived parenting
and the intervening and outcome variables. Inclusion of
parent-report questionnaires is recommended for future
research. Further, cross-sectional studies cannot provide
evidence for whether perceived parenting indeed affects
adolescents’ needs satisfaction, their developing empathic
skills, their recognitions of humanness, and their tendency
to engage in cyber-bullying. Longitudinal or experimental
research would allow testing an alternative temporal
ordering of the variables included in the model.
Further, the data were collected by a particular age period
as well as in a specific cultural context, which may limit the
generalizability of the findings. Cyprus is a relatively col-
lectivisticly oriented country, where the expression of
aggression and violence in interpersonal relationships may
be displayed differently as compared to the individualistic
ones. Similarly, it could be interesting to test whether the
findings also generalize to more clinical populations.
Finally, future research would do well also to assess
other relevant aspects of parenting, such as parents’ use of
behavioral control (i.e., the communication of clear rules),
in order to have a more holistic view and interpretation of
the effects of parenting on bullying.
Conclusion
Taken together, the findings obtained in this study shed
light on the important role of the parents for understanding
adolescent cyber-bullying behavior through the satisfaction
of their need for autonomy, their empathic capacity
towards others and their recognition of humanness to those
involved in bullying behavior. Based on the above, it seems
that a number of practices could be launched in order to
actively support parents and schools in their role to prevent
the manifestation of cyber-bullying behaviors. These
practices may be taken in school environments directly,
and may involve educational discussions with children
regarding the effects of online bullying, or the provision of
immediate information about the dehumanizing conse-
quences of bullying or cyberbullying in school, in order to
foster empathy in a non-controlling way (cf. Kaplan and
Assor 2012). On the other hand, parents can respond to the
theme of cyber-bullying in autonomy-supportive ways,
such as discussing with children about the usage of social
networking sites, forming rules for online behaviors, or
proposing other media that they might enjoy (Patchin and
Hinduja 2012).
