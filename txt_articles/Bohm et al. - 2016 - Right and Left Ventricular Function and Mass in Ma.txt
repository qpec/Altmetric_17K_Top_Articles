he beneficial effect of moderate regular exercise on car-
diovascular health is well known and has led to recom-
mendations for both primary and secondary prevention of 
cardiovascular diseases.1–3 However, there is an incomplete 
understanding of the dose-response relationship, in particu-
lar, with regard to a safe upper-dose limit beyond which the 
adverse effects of exercise may outweigh its benefits.4 Several 
studies have demonstrated that acute prolonged strenuous 
exercise such as a marathon, ultramarathon, or triathlon is 
associated with transient reductions in right ventricular ejec-
tion fraction (RVEF) and elevated cardiac biomarkers of myo-
cardial injury, all of which return to normal within 1 week.5–8 
A study by Heidbüchel et al9 identified a high prevalence of 
right ventricular (RV) structural and arrhythmic involvement 
in endurance athletes being evaluated in the context of symp-
toms like palpitations and dizziness. Thus, the hypothesis was 
put forward that long-term intensive endurance exercise train-
ing and competition may result in irreversible RV structural 
and functional changes termed exercise-induced arrhythmo-
genic RV cardiomyopathy (ARVC).10 This hypothesis has been 
strongly discussed because these conclusions are mainly based 
on observational studies involving a small and selected group 
of symptomatic athletes.11,12 Furthermore, several studies did 
Background—It is under debate whether the cumulative effects of intensive endurance exercise induce chronic cardiac 
damage, mainly involving the right heart. The aim of this study was to examine the cardiac structure and function in 
long-term elite master endurance athletes with special focus on the right ventricle by contrast-enhanced cardiovascular 
magnetic resonance.
Methods and Results—Thirty-three healthy white competitive elite male master endurance athletes (age range, 30–60 years) 
with a training history of 29±8 years, and 33 white control subjects pair-matched for age, height, and weight underwent 
cardiopulmonary exercise testing, echocardiography including tissue-Doppler imaging and speckle tracking, and 
cardiovascular magnetic resonance. Indexed left ventricular mass and right ventricular mass (left ventricular mass/body 
surface area, 96±13 and 62±10 g/m2; P<0.001; right ventricular mass/body surface area, 36±7 and 24±5 g/m2; P<0.001) 
and indexed left ventricular end-diastolic volume and right ventricular end-diastolic volume (left ventricular end-diastolic 
volume/body surface area, 104±13 and 69±18 mL/m2; P<0.001; right ventricular end-diastolic volume/body surface area, 
110±22 and 66±16 mL/m2; P<0.001) were significantly increased in athletes in comparison with control subjects. Right 
ventricular ejection fraction did not differ between athletes and control subjects (52±8 and 54±6%; P=0.26). Pathological 
late enhancement was detected in 1 athlete. No correlations were found for left ventricular and right ventricular volumes 
and ejection fraction with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and high-sensitive troponin was negative in all subjects.
Conclusions—Based on our results, chronic right ventricular damage in elite endurance master athletes with 
lifelong high training volumes seems to be unlikely. Thus, the hypothesis of an exercise-induced arrhythmogenic 
right ventricular cardiomyopathy has to be questioned.  (Circulation. 2016;133:1927-1935. DOI: 10.1161/

not detect any evidence of myocardial RV damage in endurance 
athletes,11,13–15 and increases in biomarkers are not necessar-
ily linked to RV injury because the exercise-induced increases 
could also reflect a physiological mechanism.16 Therefore, to 
date, long-term clinical consequences caused by repeated inten-
sive endurance exercise remain speculative. Studies evaluating 
the clinical impact of long-term intensive endurance training 
and competition in high-level elite master athletes are rare.17–
20 In addition, information about training volume (hours per 
week) and history (years) are often lacking, and cardiopulmo-
nary exercise testing with quantification of the aerobic capacity 
by measuring maximal oxygen uptake (V
o2max) and power out-
put for an assessment of sport-specific performance in profes-
sional elite endurance athletes with a long training history have 
not been performed so far.17–19 Therefore, the aim of this study 
was to examine the cardiac structure and function with special 
emphasis on the RV by contrast-enhanced cardiovascular mag-
netic resonance (CMR) and complementary echocardiographic 
tissue Doppler imaging and strain data in long-term active, elite 
endurance master athletes including world class athletes.
We hypothesized that an exercise-induced RV cardiac 
damage (eg, ARVC) in these subjects would result in a RV 
overload with a disproportionate ratio of left ventricular end-
diastolic volume (LVEDV) to right ventricular end-diastolic 
volume (RVEDV) in comparison with control subjects, an 
impairment of RV function, or late enhancement (LE) as an 
indicator of myocardial necrosis or fibrosis. Furthermore, 
we hypothesized that repeated exercise-induced RV damage 
resulting in a chronic ventricular overload should go along 
with an elevated brain natriuretic peptide concentration at rest 
in comparison with control subjects.
Methods
Study Population
Thirty-three healthy, white elite male master endurance athletes 
(age range, 30–60 years), still being in regular competition, with a 
recent continuous training history of ≥10 years and ≥10 hours per 
week were recruited. Of them, 16 athletes were former elite profes-
sional athletes, including a former ironman world champion and 
several second- and third-ranked professional athletes at the Hawaii 
Ironman, the world record holder at the long distance triathlon, a sec-
ond-ranked cyclist of the Vuelta a España (Tour of Spain), 6 Olympic 
athletes in the triathlon and rowing disciplines, and a former winner 
of the Munich Marathon. The control group (exercising ≤3 hours/wk) 
consisted of 33 healthy white men pair-matched for age, and second-
ary for height (mean maximal tolerated deviation, ±5 cm) and weight 
(mean maximal tolerated deviation, ±5 kg). All athletes had to refrain 
from training for the last 48 hours before the examination. To exclude 
cardiovascular and other relevant diseases, each participant under-
went a physical examination, resting ECG, blood pressure at rest, and 
echocardiography. In addition, blood samples were drawn at rest 30 
minutes before the cardiopulmonary exercise test to determine stan-
dard blood parameters and high-sensitive troponin T (cobas e assay, 
Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), and N-terminal pro-brain 
natriuretic peptide (cobas e assay, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, 
Germany), as well, to detect acute myocardial damage and maladap-
tation, respectively. Exclusion criteria for study participants included 
any history of cardiopulmonary disease (including cardiovascular 
risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking), 
standard contraindications for CMR imaging (eg, claustrophobia, 
certain metallic implant devices, prior allergic reaction to gadolin-
ium-contrast agents), and a V
o2max <50 mL·kg–1·min–1 for athletes 
in the cycle/treadmill ergometry. All subjects denied the use of illicit 
substances and had not been tested positive for doping in their career. 
The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Saarländische 
Ärztekammer, Saarbrücken, Germany (SÄK), and all participants 
gave their written informed consent.
Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test
A cardiopulmonary exercise test until volitional exhaustion was per-
formed to assess the maximal physical performance of athletes and 
control subjects by means of power output and V
o2max. By doing 
this, we were able to examine if their physical performance matched 
their training history. V
o2max was measured by using a gas-exchange 
device with breath-by-breath technology (Cortex MetaLyzer 3B, 
Leipzig, Germany). The device was calibrated before each test 
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. After a warm-up of 
10 minutes, an individually adjusted ramp protocol was chosen to 
exhaust subjects within 10 to 15 minutes. Cyclists were tested by 
cycle ergometry (Lode Excalibur Sport, Groningen, Netherlands), 
and long-distance runners were tested by treadmill ergometry 
(Woodway, Weil am Rhein, Germany). Triathletes could choose the 
type of ergometry depending on their best discipline. Control subjects 
were tested according to the pair-matched athlete’s choice of ergome-
try. All tested subjects had to meet 2 criteria for exhaustion (heart rate 
[HR]max cycle ergometry: 200 – age, or HFmax treadmill ergometry: 
220 – age; maximal blood lactate concentration, >8 mmol/L; maxi-
mal respiratory exchange ratio, >1.10). Capillary blood samples for 
the determination of blood lactate concentrations as 1 criterion for 
exhaustion were taken at rest, 3 minutes and 5 minutes after cessation 
of the exercise test because peak values of blood lactate concentra-
tions typically appear at 3 to 8 minutes postexercise when volitional 
exhaustion has been reached or at least approached.
Echocardiography
Echocardiography was performed on a GE System Vivid S6 (GE 
Healthcare, Solingen, Germany) according to the guidelines of the 
American Society of Echocardiography. M-mode echocardiography 
was used to determine the inner left ventricular end-diastolic diam-
eter (LVEDD) and right ventricular end-diastolic diameter, interven-
tricular septal thickness (IVST), posterior wall thickness (PWT), and 
fractional shortening. Total LVEDD (TEDD = LVEDD + IVST + 
PWT) was determined on the mitral valve plane (TEDDM) and the 
papillary muscle plane (TEDDP). Total left ventricular (LV) longi-
tudinal diameter (TLD) was determined in the 4-chamber view. The 
LV total diastolic volume (TDV [milliliters]) and heart volume (HV 
[milliliters]) were calculated by the following formula21:

Tricuspid and mitral annular plane systolic excursion was mea-
sured using a 4-chamber view with M-mode placed through the tri-
cuspid and mitral annulus, respectively. Tissue Doppler imaging was 
recorded in an apical 4-chamber view by placing the sample volume 
at the septal and lateral corners of the mitral and tricuspid annulus, 
respectively. Tissue Doppler imaging velocities of the mitral and tri-
cuspid annulus (s′, E′, A′) and the derived parameters (E′/A′ ratio) 
were obtained.
Two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography analysis 
was obtained from an apical 4-chamber view, using conventional 
2-dimensional gray-scale echocardiography. Off-line analysis was 
performed by an experienced reader, blinded to the study, using a 
commercially available semiautomated 2-dimensional strain soft-
ware (EchoPac, GE Healthcare, USA). After manually tracing along 
the endocardial border from base to apex and width setting to match 
the wall thickness, 3 segments (basal, middle, apical) for each wall 
were analyzed. If the automated 2-dimensional analysis appraisal of 
acceptable tracking quality indicated inappropriate tracking, retracing 
was performed. If that failed, segments were excluded. Longitudinal

strain values in the basal, mid, and apical segments, and the global 
longitudinal strain value, as well, for both ventricles were measured. 
Because speckle tracking echocardiography relies on good imaging 
quality, we had to exclude 1 athlete/control pair for LV longitudinal 
strain analysis and 7 athlete/control pairs for RV longitudinal strain 
analysis.
Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance
CMR was performed by using a 1.5-tesla magnet (Magnetom Vision, 
Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). An advanced cardiac software pack-
age was used. Images were acquired with the subject in the supine 
position.
Double-oblique short-axis images were acquired for the mea-
surement of LV and RV volumes, mass, wall thickness, and heart 
function. For this purpose, retrospectively, ECG-gated single-slice 
breath-hold steady-state free precession cine sequences (TrueFisp; 
repetition time, 60 ms; echo time, 1.89 ms; averages, 1; slice thick-
ness, 6 mm; matrix size, 192×192; phases, 25; views per segment, 
14; bandwidth, 965 Hz/pixel; and flip angle, 80°) were acquired 
with contiguous short-axis planes covering the LV, completed by 
the horizontal and vertical long-axis views. In addition steady-state 
free precession cine images of the RV and LV outflow tract were 
acquired.
For LE imaging, 5 to 10 minutes after contrast medium injection 
(0.1 mmol/kg BW MultiHance [Gd-BOPTA]), T1-weighted ECG-
gated breath-hold inversion recovery sequences (repetition time, 750 
ms; echo time, 4.8 ms; inversion time, 200–300 ms) manually regu-
lated to provide optimal signal suppression over normal myocardium, 
slice thickness (7 mm) in short-axis orientation, matching the short-
axis steady-state free precession sequences, were acquired.
Evaluation of LV and RV volumes, mass, wall thickness, and 
function was performed by using a commercially available software 
(SyngoVia, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). To evaluate LV and RV 
volume and mass, manual tracing was used to outline endocardial and 
epicardial borders. Trabeculae and papillary muscles were included 
in the ventricular volumes (and excluded from the wall mass) for 
efficiency and reproducibility. To calculate mass, the interventricular 
septum was included as part of the LV. Epicardial fat and the pericar-
dium were excluded from LV and RV mass. End-diastolic volumes 
(EDVs) and end-systolic volumes (ESVs) were used to determine 
stroke volume (SV = EDV – ESV) and ejection fraction (EF = EDV 
– ESV/EDV × 100). The LV and RV mass was determined by taking 
the sum of the EDVs within the epicardial and endocardial borders 
of the short-axis slices and multiplying the myocardial tissue volume 
by its specific density of 1.05 g/cm3. In addition, all parameters were 
indexed to body surface area (BSA) for comparative analysis to mini-
mize differences of cardiac parameters related to height and weight. 
Finally, criteria indicative of ARVC, such as isolated RV enlarge-
ment, wall motion abnormalities, or aneurysm formation, were noted.
Pattern and extent of LE were assessed by using short-axis views 
and were considered present if they were detectable in 2 orthogonal 
planes. LE patterns were defined as indicative of myocardial infarc-
tion if they were located predominantly in subendocardial areas, fac-
ultatively extending to midmyocardial and transmural regions, and 
attributable to coronary perfusion territories. Midmyocardial or sub-
epicardial LE with patchy or spotty distribution was defined as a non-
ischemic pattern. Two experienced radiologists/cardiologists visually 
judged the occurrence (absence versus presence), localization, and 
pattern of LE.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed by using the statistical program Statistica. 
Univariate normality assumptions were verified with the Shapiro-
Wilk test. Continuous, normally distributed data are expressed as 
mean±standard deviation or percentage values. Not normally distrib-
uted values are expressed as median (interquartile range). Differences 
between pairwise-matched endurance athletes and control subjects 
were measured by the paired t test. Pearson correlation coefficients 
were calculated for selected variables. The results were considered 
significant at P<0.05 for the α-error.
Results
We had to exclude 6 athletes because of poor ergometric/
V
o2max performance (3), hypertension (1), aneurysm of the 
ascending aorta (1), and claustrophobia during CMR (1). 
Five dropouts in the control subject group occurred because 
of concerns about the contrast agent (2), hypertension (1), 
mitral valve prolapse (1), and complete right bundle-brunch 
block (1). The final study population consisted of 33 ath-
letes and 33 pair-matched control subjects. Table 1 provides 
information on anthropometric, sports-related, and exer-
cise physiological characteristics of the study population. 
Electrocardiographically, 3 athletes showed findings unrelated 
to training with T-wave inversions beyond V1 (2 athletes: V1 to 
V2; 1 athlete: V1 through V4). None of the athletes presented or 
had experienced atrial fibrillation. Echocardiographically, 22 
athletes had an athlete’s heart, defined as a heart volume ≥13 
mL/kg body weight.22
Morphological Parameters
In athletes, left ventricular mass (LVM) and right ventricular 
mass (RVM) were significantly increased in comparison with 
control subjects (LVM, 188±26 and 124±23 g; P<0.001; RVM, 
70±13 and 49±11 g; P<0.001). In addition, indexed LVM and 
RVM (values divided by BSA) at end-diastole showed similar

differences (Figure 1). The ratio of LVM to RVM did not dif-
fer significantly for athletes and controls (Figure 2). LVM and 
RVM correlated significantly with V
o2max (r=0.86 and 0.74, 
respectively).
Regarding ventricular volumes, LVEDV and RVEDV 
were significantly greater in athletes than in control subjects 
(LVEDV, 203±26 and 139±42 mL; P<0.001; RVEDV, 215±43 
and 133±37 mL; P<0.001). Indexed LVEDV and RVEDV 
showed similar differences (Figure 3), resulting in greater 
SV (LVSV/BSA, 60±10 and 42±12 mL/m2; P<0.001; RVSV/
BSA, 57±13 and 36±10 mL/m2; P<0.001). The LVEDV-to-
RVEDV ratio differed significantly between athletes and 
control subjects (Figure 2). LVEDV and RVEDV correlated 
significantly with V
o2max (r=0.77 for both parameters). 
Athletes had a significantly greater RVEDV than LVEDV 
(athletes, 215±43 and 203±26 mL; P<0.05), whereas, in con-
trol subjects, RVEDV and LVEDV did not differ significantly 
(controls, 139±42 and 133±37 mL; P=0.14).
Morphologically, most athletes showed a slight bulging in 
the basal to midventricular part of the RV free wall with a 
mild angular deviation, which is in keeping with the signifi-
cantly increased RVEDV in comparison with control subjects. 
Three athletes had bulging of the apical RV free wall and sus-
picious trabecularization could be seen in one of them in CMR 
(Figure 4). However, no ARVC criteria such as isolated RV 
enlargement, wall motion abnormalities, or aneurysm forma-
tion were found in any of these athletes. Four control subjects 
had bulging of the apical RV free wall and 2 control subjects

showed increased trabecularization. No ARVC criteria were 
fulfilled in the control group either.
Functional Parameters
Resting heart rate was significantly lower in athletes than in 
controls (48±7 and 65±11/min; P<0.001). Regarding echo-
cardiographic functional metrics, tricuspid annular plane 
systolic excursion was significantly increased in athletes in 
comparison with control subjects (Table 2). However, tri-
cuspid annular plane systolic excursion was still within the 
normal range in the control group. With the exception of A′, 
no significant difference was found for LV/RV tissue Doppler 
indices between athletes and controls (Table 2). LV and RV 
longitudinal strains did not differ between athletes and con-
trol subjects, with the exception of the RV basal longitudinal 
strain (Table 2). Regarding CMR, there was no significant dif-
ference between athletes and control subjects for LV ejection 
fraction (LVEF; 57±7 and 59±5%; P=0.19) and RVEF (52±8 
and 54±6%; P=0.26). One athlete (3%) had a LVEF <45% 
(40%). This athlete also presented decreased LV longitudinal 
strain values at echocardiography. Five athletes (15%) and 3 
control subjects (9%) had a RVEF <45%. None of these ath-
letes/control subjects had a RVEF <40%. In addition, none 
of these athletes showed echocardiographically a decrease in 
RV longitudinal strain. Cardiac index at rest did not differ sig-
nificantly between athletes and control subjects (2.8±0.6 and 
2.6±0.8 L·min–1·m–2; P=0.23).
Late Enhancement
In 1 of 33 elite endurance athletes (3%), pathological LE 
was detected that could be localized subepicardially in the 
LV posteroinferior region on the short-axis view, corre-
sponding to a nonischemic pattern (most likely because 
of a previous asymptomatic pericarditis). However, this 
athlete did not meet any of the revised Task Force Criteria 
for ARVC. One athlete showed a thinned myocardium in 
the inferior region of the LV, looking like a normal asym-
metry, because no pathological LE was detected and the 
myocardial function was visually normal. All other ath-
letes had no structural myocardial alterations suggestive

jects showed LE.
Cardiac Biomarkers
N-Terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide did not differ sig-
nificantly between athletes and control subjects (37±22 and 
43±28 pg/mL; P=0.32). High-sensitive troponin T was nor-
mal in all subjects, but significantly higher in the athlete group 
(5±2 and 4±2 pg/mL; P<0.05). No correlations were found 
between LVEF and RVEF and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic 
peptide, nor high-sensitive troponin T. Regarding volumes, no 
correlations were found between LVEDV and RVEDV and 
N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, nor high-sensitive 
troponin T.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that sys-
tematically examined a unique cohort of long-time active elite 
master endurance athletes by means of detailed training vol-
ume/history, cardiopulmonary exercise testing with quantifi-
cation of V
o2max, and power output to elucidate the impact 
of their intense endurance training on myocardial structure 
and function by contrast-enhanced CMR and complementary 
echocardiographic tissue Doppler imaging and strain data. 
Researchers postulated that chronic intense endurance exer-
cise with repeated bouts of high RV wall stress might promote 
adverse RV remodeling, which has led to the hypothesis of 
an exercise-induced ARVC that is currently under debate.10–12 
However, our results indicate that no signs of a chronic endur-
ance exercise–induced RV maladaptation or acquired cardiac 
pathology occur in (asymptomatic) elite master endurance 
athletes with a professional training history of 29 years.
Morphological Parameters
As expected, endurance athletes showed significantly 
greater EDV and ESV of both ventricles in comparison 
with the control subjects, indicating exercise-induced car-
diac remodeling. Our finding of a significantly greater RV

control group, underlining that greater RV loading may be 
matched by greater RV remodeling. However, according to 
our results, this should not be interpreted as a sign of pathol-
ogy because functional RV parameters by CMR and echo-
cardiography were within the normal range and did not differ 
significantly from the control subjects. The lower LVEDV in 
comparison with RVEDV (ratios <1) have been confirmed 
by several other CMR studies.23–26 Interestingly, our morpho-
logical finding of mild angular deviated bulging at the basal 
to midventricular part of the RV free wall in our athlete’s 
cohort may signify that the RV dilation induced by long-term 
endurance training primarily involves the RV main body. A 
review by the study group of LaGerche27 dealing with the 
athlete’s heart also describes a bulging of the RV free wall in 
endurance athletes.
The ventricular masses were within the range described in 
the literature, and the ratio LVM/RVM did not differ between 
athletes and control subjects. In general, a wide variability in 
ventricular mass values has been described in the literature, 
ranging from 56±11 to 126±14 g/m2 for LVM and 15±2 to 
41±4 g/m2 for RVM, respectively.18,19,25,28 This wide range of 
extreme values can be explained by: (1) sex differences and 
study populations with the inclusion of female subjects; (2) 
different fitness levels and heart volumes of studied subjects; 
and (3) methodological differences in the off-line image anal-
ysis (eg, exclusion versus inclusion of papillary muscles for 
wall mass).
Functional Parameters
In the present study, there was no significant difference 
between athletes and control subjects for LVEF and particu-
larly RVEF, corresponding well with results from previous 
CMR studies.17,19,28 Five athletes had a RVEF <45% which is 
considered as the lower reference limit of normal for the left 
and right ventricular systolic ejection fraction in athletes, 
as measured by MRI.27 However, lower values may also 
be physiological, at least in some endurance athletes with 
athlete’s heart.27 In general, RVEF in athletes (52±8%) was 
within the range reported by other studies,19,23–25,29 whereas 
some studies showed even higher RVEFs for athletes.17–19,24,28 
These discrepancies may be attributable to the use of dif-
ferent methods of image analysis, thus affecting volume 
parameters and consecutively EF. Complementary echo-
cardiographic functional metrics only showed a significant 
lower RV basal longitudinal strain in athletes in comparison 
with control subjects. However, a modest reduction in sys-
tolic deformation at the basal wall of the RV in athletes has 
also been described in a recent review by D’Ascenzi et al30 
and can be explained by different curvature changes in RV 
apex and basis. Moreover, LaGerche et al31 postulated that, 
given that volume is greatest at the RV base, a lesser degree 
of deformation may be required to generate the same stroke 
volume, thereby explaining why RV deformation may be 
reduced in this region. A recent meta-analysis of postendur-
ance exercise studies revealed that intense prolonged exer-
cise is associated with a decrease in RV function possibly 
resulting in a chronic injury of the RV.7 However, our CMR 
and echocardiographic findings clearly refute this hypoth-
esis of chronic RV damage induced by prolonged intensive 
endurance exercise, and the fact that we did not find any cor-
relation between cardiac biomarkers and RVEDV and RVEF 
further strengthens this notion.
Late Enhancement
Pathological LE was only detected in 1 athlete (3%). However, 
this asymptomatic athlete did not fulfill any of the revised 
Task Force Criteria for ARVC, and the nonischemic LE pat-
tern is rather suggestive of a silent perimyocarditis in the past. 
Because of the low prevalence of LE in our studied subjects, 
we do not consider that exercise alone induced this clini-
cal finding. However, it remains unclear if repeated extreme 
endurance exercise may affect adverse remodeling and scar 
formation in the presence of another trigger such as myocar-
dial inflammation.
In general, there is a wide discrepancy in the litera-
ture regarding the prevalence of LE in endurance athletes. 
A study by Breuckmann et al32 found that 12% of nonelite 
marathon runners had LE, which was 3-fold more than the 
sedentary controls. A small study by Wilson et al17 demon-
strated LE in 6 elite veteran male endurance athletes (50% 
of the study cohort) of which 5 showed a non–coronary 
artery disease LE pattern. Karlstedt et al18 demonstrated LE 
in only 2 participants with evidence of coronary artery dis-
ease on subsequent cardiac computed tomography. Several 
other studies conducted with cardiac MRI among athletes 
did not detect any LE, whereas they confirmed chronic 
remodeling of both the LV and RV.5,26,33 Our results dem-
onstrate that, in the vast majority of elite endurance ath-
letes with a long-term intensive training history, no signs of 
myocardial damage could be detected, thus indicating that 
even long-term intensive endurance training does not seem 
to induce myocardial necrosis or fibrosis at least in well-
trained and exercise-adapted athletes. This finding is sup-
ported by the fact that none of the athletes had shown any 
arrhythmias during the cardiopulmonary exercise test up to 
exhaustion nor described any symptoms related to malig-
nant arrhythmias in the past.
Task Force Criteria for ARVC
The accurate differentiation of normal athlete’s heart from 
pathological conditions is challenging and largely depends 
on our knowledge of what constitutes normal. However, nor-
mal CMR values for endurance athletes are far less numerous 
than echocardiographic values. When applying the revised 
Task Force Criteria for ARVC using cardiac MRI, 16 athletes 
(48.5%) fulfilled the RVEDV index major criterion, whereas 
no athlete fulfilled the RVEF major criterion. Thus, RVEF 
seems to be a more suitable parameter to distinguish endur-
ance athletes from ARVC patients. Regarding the athletes 
with a major criterion (RVEDV), none of them had shown 
LE or reported any cardiopulmonary complaints beforehand, 
and power output at cardiopulmonary exercise testing was 
within the expected range in all of them. However, we rec-
ommended additional diagnostic workup (stress MRI) in 1 
athlete who presented a bulging of the apical RV free wall 
with apical trabecularizations and fulfilled the RVEF minor 
criterion for ARVC (RVEF, 41%, with LVEF also being 
decreased to 40%).

Study Limitations
An important limitation of this study is the use of a cross-
sectional study design that may have led to a recruitment bias. 
However, as long as there is no true longitudinal study avail-
able (hardly achievable in the near future), a cross-sectional 
study design is, to date, the only conceivable methodical 
approach to detect cardiac structural and functional changes 
in a professional training life. Furthermore, it seems unlikely 
that those athletes who stopped their career because of cardio-
vascular symptoms all experienced exercise-induced cardiac 
diseases.
In terms of fibrosis, we cannot completely exclude sub-
clinical fibrosis, because no T1 mapping was performed. 
Furthermore, we did not immediately perform additional 
diagnostic workups in subjects with major ARVC criteria or 
proven LE for practical reasons. Although we cannot com-
pletely rule out the use of illicit substances in our athlete 
cohort, none of them had ever been tested positive for pro-
hibited substances according to the doping list, and the use of 
prohibited substances was denied by all the studied athletes. 
Finally, the present results only apply to white male athletes 
because we did not study black or female athletes.
Conclusions
This study found an expected exercise-induced cardiac 
remodeling in asymptomatic long-term elite master endurance 
athletes with no signs of maladaptation or acquired cardiac 
pathology. Thus, at least the cause-effect and dose-response 
relationship between intensive endurance exercise and the 
hypothesis of an exercise-induced ARVC has to be questioned.
Perspectives
As a perspective, follow-up examinations on highly trained 
master athletes with borderline or pathological findings are 
required to be able to better understand the long-term clinical 
consequences. Furthermore, large-scale longitudinal studies 
with different cohorts of endurance athletes should enable a 
better evaluation of the cause-effect and dose-response rela-
tionships between endurance exercise and cardiovascular 
events.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
It is under debate whether the cumulative effects of years of high-intensity/high-volume exercise induce chronic cardiac 
damage, mainly involving the right heart. This study examined the cardiac structure and function by contrast-enhanced 
cardiovascular magnetic resonance and complementary echocardiographic tissue Doppler imaging and strain data in 33 elite 
male master endurance athletes including world-class athletes (age range, 30–60 years) with a training history of 29±8 years 
and a control group, pair-matched for age and secondary for height and weight. The athlete group demonstrated expected 
evidence of exercise-induced cardiac remodeling. However, cardiovascular magnetic resonance and echocardiographic func-
tional parameters such as left ventricular ejection fraction/right ventricular ejection fraction and longitudinal strain values 
did not differ between athletes and controls. Pathological late enhancement was only detected in 1 asymptomatic athlete 
(nonischemic pattern suggestive of a silent perimyocarditis in the past), who did not meet any of the revised Task Force 
Criteria for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. No correlation was found for left ventricular and right ven-
tricular volumes and ejection fractions with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. In summary, in this study, no signs of 
a long-term exercise-induced cardiac maladaptation or pathology could be demonstrated in asymptomatic long-term elite 
master endurance athletes. Therefore, at least the cause-effect and dose-response relationship between long-term intensive 
endurance exercise and the hypothesis of an exercise-induced arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy has to be 
questioned.
