ABSTRACT
Introduction: Atrophic
scarring
occurs
throughout the course of inflammatory acne
and across the spectrum of severity. This study
evaluates perceptions of the general population
toward individuals with clear skin and acne
scars.
Methods: An online survey administered in the
USA, UK, Japan, Germany, France and Brazil to
respondents 18 years and over presented three
facial
pictures
of
clear
skin
or
digitally
superimposed acne scars (but no active acne
lesions) in a random fashion. At least one clear
and one scar picture were presented to each
participant.
Results: Among
the
4618
responders,
33%
themselves had facial acne scars. The skin was
the first thing noticed about the face by 41%
when viewing pictures with scars vs 8% viewing
clear skin (p\0.05). Those with scars were less

INTRODUCTION
Acne is one of the most common skin diseases,
affecting around 650 million of the world’s
population [1]. It is a multifactorial disease
encompassing comedones, papules, pustules,
nodules and scars [2, 3]. Scarring can remain
for life and therefore act as a prominent and
visible reminder of the disease [3]. Atrophic
acne scarring is more frequent than many
individuals may realize, with at least 40% of
active acne patients having scars [4].
Over the years, several different risk factors
have been linked with scar development [5–7].
Recent data highlight that acne severity, time
between
acne
onset
and
first
effective
treatment, and acne relapse after treatment are
key
factors
related
to
scarring.
Although
scarring occurs most frequently in patients
with severe or very severe acne, it is becoming
increasingly apparent that scars can occur in
patients with all severities of acne, including
those who are almost clear or have mild acne
[4]. Inflammation of the pilosebaceous follicle
deep within the dermis is one of the main
pathophysiological processes involved in acne
scarring, with data showing that the type and
magnitude of the inflammatory response is
strongly
linked
with
scar
development
[3,
5–7]. Other factors related to scar development
include family history of acne, acne location
and acne duration [4, 8, 9]. Acne scars are more
common on the face than on the back and chest
[8,
9].
The
presence
of
clinically
relevant
scarring, defined as mild or greater, increases
with acne duration and reaches a peak after a
person has had acne for 2–3 years [9].
Acne can have a huge impact on a person’s
quality of life. It can cause depression, which
may result in impaired social functioning and
suicidal ideation [10]. In addition, the social,
psychological
and
emotional
problems
experienced by individuals with acne can be
worse than those experienced by individuals
with
other
limiting
long-standing
illnesses,
such as asthma, epilepsy and arthritis [11].
Scarring is often the primary concern of a
patient with acne [3]. It has been known for a
long
time
that
acne
scarring
can
cause
depression and is a risk factor for suicide [12].
More data are now beginning to emerge on the
impact of acne scars, specifically on quality of
life. Individuals want to hide or cover their scars
and feel embarrassed, self-conscious and/or less

 self-confident.
Scars
are
also
a
source
of
frustration,
sadness,
anger
and/or
anxiety.
People
who
develop
acne
scars
feel
their
appearance interferes with their professional
relationships
and
chances
of
future
employment [4]. The prevention of acne scars
therefore needs to be viewed as a major goal in
the treatment of inflammatory acne [7]. Early,
aggressive and appropriate treatment of acne
before scarring occurs is important, as it may
effectively decrease the risk of acne scarring
[2–5, 13].
As early as the 1970s, the impact of physical
appearance ‘stereotypes’ on social desirability
and future career prospects has been evaluated
[14, 15]. More recently, numerous studies have
shown that judgments and decisions are often
negatively impacted by physical appearance, for
example higher weight is associated with lower
wages, attractiveness is an advantage when job
applications
are
mediocre
and
high
facial
adiposity
reduces
the
perceived
leadership
ability [16–19]. Dermatologists focused on acne
from the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes
in Acne group hypothesized that the presence of
acne scars would elicit negative impressions on
other people’s perceptions of such individuals,
which would also impact judgments made about
them. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
evaluate
the
perceptions
of
the
general
population
aged
18 years
and
over
to
individuals with either clear skin or digitally
superimposed acne scars, but no active acne
lesions.
METHODS
A survey was developed by members of the
Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne
group
(Online
Appendix).
The
study
was
conducted
between
September
12
and
September 18, 2012 using an email invitation
followed by an online survey. Email addresses
were
obtained
from
individuals
who
had
self-opted to participate in research surveys
through a variety of sources. The survey was
administered in six countries (USA, UK, Japan,
Germany,
France
and
Brazil)
among
respondents from the general population aged
18 years and over, identified from the large
database of email addresses available. Quotas
were set for demographic factors such as gender,
region, ethnicity and age to ensure reliable and
accurate representation of the entire population
aged
18
and
over
in
each
country.
All
respondents took the survey in their native
language.
As part of the survey, each respondent
answered questions about facial pictures of
men and women with either clear skin or
digitally
superimposed
acne
scars,
but
no
active
acne
lesions
(Fig. 1).
A
total
of
12
images per country were used in the survey,
comprising 50% male and 50% female with one
clear and one scarred picture for six separate
models. Each respondent was presented with
three facial pictures in a random fashion, the
only condition being that at least one clear and
one scarred picture was presented to each
participant. Respondents in each country saw
a
mix
of
ethnicities
that
represented
the
demographic
of
their
nation.
This
design
allowed the respondents to focus in-depth on
specific visual stimuli and kept the survey at a
reasonable length. Respondents also answered
questions
without
seeing
pictures,
which
included
questions
about
their
own
experiences with acne and acne scars.
The data were processed using the Quantum
software (Unicom Systems, Inc, Mission Hills,
CA,
USA)
and
T-tests
run
using
a
95%
confidence level/5% risk level. Only significant
differences
equal
to
or
higher
than
the
designated confidence level were reported.

RESULTS
Experiences of Acne and Acne Scars
Among Respondents
Responses were obtained from 4618 individuals
(American: 1039; British: 714; Japanese: 701;
German: 703; French: 736; Brazilian: 725) aged
18 years and over (ages 18–25: 15%; ages 26–35:
18%; ages 36–50: 30%; ages 51?: 38%). There
was a similar distribution between male and
female respondents (male: 49%; female: 51%).
A total of 13% of respondents presently had
acne, 46% had acne previously and 41% never
had acne. Among the subgroups who presently
had acne or had acne previously, 29% had used
prescription acne treatments (39% presently
with
acne
vs
26%
previously
with
acne,
p\0.05), 43% were never warned about scars
that
might
result
from
their
acne
(34%
presently with acne vs 46% previously with
acne, p\0.05) and 33% had current scars on
the face as a direct result of their acne (58%
presently with acne vs 25% previously with
acne, p\0.05). Approximately two-thirds (66%)
of all respondents questioned from the UK and
US (the only countries where this question was
asked) would be more concerned about the way
their face would look with scars resulting from
acne, rather than the acne itself (34%).
First Impressions of Others
When provided with a list of facial features
without
seeing
any
pictures,
17%
of
respondents
reported
that
they
typically
noticed a person’s skin first, compared with
60%, 11%, 8% and 4% for eyes, hair, mouth and
nose, respectively. These results did not vary
among those respondents presently with acne,
previously with acne, with no acne presently/
previously,
with
acne
presently/previously
without
current
acne
scars
or
with
acne
presently/previously with current acne scars.
Eyes
were
first
noticed
significantly
more
frequently among respondents previously with
acne
(60%)
or
with
no
acne
presently/
previously (62%) compared with respondents
presently with acne (55%; both p\0.05). Skin
was first noticed significantly more frequently
among respondents presently with acne (21%)
compared with respondents previously with
acne
(17%)
or
with
no
acne
presently/
previously (16%; both p\0.05). Respondents

 with acne presently/previously with current
acne scars were less likely to notice the eyes
(55% vs 61%; p\0.05) and more likely to notice
the skin (22% vs 16%; p\0.05) compared with
respondents
with
acne
presently/previously
without current acne scars.
When viewing the pictures presented, the
proportion of respondents reporting the skin
was the first thing they noticed about the
person’s
face
increased
to
25%
and
was
significantly higher when viewing pictures of
those with acne scars vs clear skin (p\0.05,
Fig. 2). When viewing pictures of those with
acne scars, the results for eye, mouth and nose
did not vary significantly among respondents
presently with acne, previously with acne, with
no
acne
presently/previously,
with
acne
presently/previously
without
current
acne
scars or with acne presently/previously with
current
acne
scars.
Hair
was
first
noticed
significantly
more
frequently
among
respondents previously with acne (14%) or
with
no
acne
presently/previously
(15%)
compared
with
respondents
presently
with
acne (11%; both p\0.05). Among respondents
presently with acne, skin was first noticed
significantly more frequently (45%) compared
with respondents previously with acne (41%) or
with no acne presently/previously (41%; both
p\0.05). Respondents with acne presently/
previously with current acne scars were less
likely to notice the hair (11% vs 14%; p\0.05)
and more likely to notice the skin (44% vs 40%;
p\0.05) compared with respondents with acne
presently/previously without current acne scars.
Emotional and Personal Attributes
In comparison to the pictures of those with
clear skin, those with acne scars were less likely
to be considered attractive, confident, happy,
healthy and successful, and more likely to be
perceived as insecure and shy (all p\0.05;
Table 1).
The significance of the responses obtained
for these attributes varied according to the acne
and scar status of the respondent (Table 2).
Just based on their appearance, respondents
were less willing to be friends with acne scarred

willing to introduce both groups to their close
friends (24% vs 25%, respectively) and let them
take care of their child/children (4% vs 3%,
respectively).
Respondents felt the presence of scars would
have a negative impact on an individual’s life.
Those with acne scars compared to those with
clear skin were perceived to be more likely to
feel stressed (35% vs 26%, p\0.05), to generally
make people feel uncomfortable (30% vs 24%;
p\0.05) and to be unhappy with their life (31%
vs 24%; p\0.05). The presence of acne scarring
was
seen
to
have
some
impact
on
what
individuals would be most likely to do on a
typical
weekend,
with
17%
vs
13%
of
respondents feeling that those with acne scars
compared to those with clear skin would stay at
home by themselves, respectively (p\0.05).
When asked which one habit (from a list
provided) the individual in the picture most
needed to improve, there was a 46% difference in
the proportion of respondents citing skin care
when viewing pictures of those with acne scars vs
clear skin (59% vs 13%; p\0.05). When viewing

the habit most commonly chosen to be in need of

34%
(Fig. 3).
Respondents with no acne presently/previously,

scars or acne presently/previously with current
acne scars viewing pictures of those with acne
scars all cited skin care as the habit most in need
of improvement significantly more frequently
than when viewing pictures of those with clear
skin (Table 3).
Skill Set and Prospects
When provided with a list of skills, respondents
were less likely to perceive those with acne scars
as having skills in public speaking, sports,
kissing, sex and singing (all p\0.05, Table 4);
the remainder of the skills were found not to be
statistically significant. The responses obtained
for these skills varied according to the acne and
scar status of the respondent (Table 5). Those
with scars were thought less likely to be hired for
a job after a job interview (78% vs 82%; p\0.05),
to be seen as a good entrepreneur (19% vs 23%;
p\0.05) or to have a promising future (78% vs
84%; p\0.05) than those with clear skin.
Cost Impact of Scars
Many
respondents
affected
by
acne
scars
reported
willingness
to
pay
at
least
some
money to get rid of their scars forever (68% of
Americans and 66% of Japanese) or to have
their skin free from scars/blemishes (58% of
Germans). In the UK, 71% of respondents felt
acne scar sufferers would be willing to spend at
least some money (an average of £1673) to
permanently remove their scars. Similarly, a
majority of French respondents (59%) and
Brazilians
(67%)
would
rather
spend
more
money on products that would make their
skin free from scars or blemishes than on
high-end clothing or shoes.
DISCUSSION
People often judge others and make decisions
based on an individual’s physical appearance
[14–19]. To our knowledge, this is the first
in-depth, multi-national survey conducted to
evaluate the perceptions of people (with or
without acne) toward individuals with clear
skin compared to those with acne scars (but no
active acne lesions).
This study demonstrates that those with
acne
scars
are
perceived
differently—with
unfavorable attributes. Furthermore, the skin is
more frequently the first facial feature noticed if
an individual has acne scars vs clear skin. Taken
together, the results of this survey suggest that
observers
infer
that
acne
scars
reflect
neglectfulness of one’s health and skin care
habits, as well as appearance. Interestingly,
when viewing pictures with acne scars, skin
care was still cited as the habit requiring most
improvement irrespective of the acne and scar
status of the respondent. Although individuals
with acne scars believe that such scars have a

pictures with either digitally superimposed acne scars or

213
 negative impact on their own quality of life [4],
it is worrying that other people may also judge
them by the presence of such scars. This
negative perception is likely to have a further
impact on the burden of those with acne scars.
Importantly, despite cultural differences, results
were similar in all countries where the survey
was carried out.
Parallels can be drawn with a previous study
showing that judgments regarding personality
based on physical appearance viewed through
full-body photographs varied depending on
posture, expression and pose [20]. More recent
data highlight that facial features also impact
first
impressions,
including
approachability,
youthful
attractiveness
and
dominance
to
different degrees [21].
This study demonstrates that the presence of
acne scars can have a negative impact on
perceived skill set and future prospects. It is
unclear
whether
people
with
acne
scars
encounter
lesser
social
or
occupational
opportunities, but these results suggest that
further research regarding such impediments
may be of value.
Many
adults
have
latent
fears
and
insecurities about acne scars, as highlighted by
the survey results showing that participants
would
be
willing
to
pay
money
to
rid
themselves
of
scars
forever.
The
survey
questions on this topic differed slightly per
country, in line with cultural expectations and
currencies used.
A
significant
challenge
for
health-care
professionals is that less than one-third (29%)
of survey participants who had acne at some
point
in
their
life
(either
presently
or
previously)
had
used
prescription
acne
treatments and almost half (43%) had never
been warned about scars that might result from

 their acne. Since clinically relevant scarring
increases with acne duration and a delay in
starting appropriate treatment [4, 8, 9], it is
important that everyone with acne is informed
about the risk of scarring and is treated early
and effectively to decrease this risk.
Although
most
respondents
were
more
concerned about the way their face would
look with scars resulting from acne rather than
the acne itself, many had not used prescription
acne treatments to help decrease the risk of such
scars [2–5, 13]. There is a need to address this
issue to gain insight into why individuals might
not seek medical advice for the treatment of
their acne. Since the treatment of scars remains
difficult, many will have permanent scars. This
persistence is another reason for informing
individuals
with
acne
and
health-care
professionals about scar prevention.
Parallels can be drawn between the results
presented here and the data obtained in a study
conducted
by
Ritvo
et
al.
looking
at
the
perceptions of teenagers with acne [22]. This
study used similar methodology to the one used
here and provided insights regarding the negative
perception of others to individuals with acne.
The current survey has limitations because
participants had to be willing to take part in the
survey and able to complete it online. In
addition,
the
survey
does
not
address
the
long-term psychosocial effect of acne scarring.
Further research is needed to evaluate data from
different countries and ethnic groups to see if
this has any impact on the results obtained. A
recent publication demonstrated that 90.8% of
Japanese
acne
patients
have
atrophic
or
hypertrophic acne scars, which have adversely
impacted their quality of life [23].
The results obtained confirm the hypothesis
from the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes
in
Acne
group
regarding
the
negative
perceptions
surrounding
acne
scars
and
broaden our understanding of the potential
impact of acne scars on an individual’s quality
of life based on the perceptions of society.
Increased
education
around
risk
factors
associated
with
scar
development
and
the
long-term
impact
of
scarring
on
both
an
individual with scars and those around them
is warranted. Further consideration must also be
given to the need for early and appropriate
treatment to reduce the likelihood of acne scar
development, so that acne patients are apprised
of both the short- and long-term potential
complications of acne.

 CONCLUSION
This multi-national survey suggests that early
treatment of primary acne lesions to decrease
the
risk
of
acne
scarring
is
important
in
preventing acne scars, as they can be perceived
negatively by society.
