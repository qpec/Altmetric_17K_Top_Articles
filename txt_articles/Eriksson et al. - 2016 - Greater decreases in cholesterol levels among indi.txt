Aim
Decreasing cholesterol levels in Western populations is the main reason for decreasing mortality due to
coronary heart disease. Our aim was to analyze trends in cholesterol levels in the population during a period
of 20 years in relation to previous cardiovascular disease (CVD), other cardiovascular risk factors, and socio-
economic status.
Methods
and results
A total of 4546 women and 4349 men aged 25–74 years participated in five population-based surveys in the
Northern Sweden MONICA Study between 1994 and 2014 (participation rate 76.8–62.5%). Total cholesterol levels
decreased from 6.2 mmol/L (95% confidence interval, CI, 6.1–6.2) in 1994 to 5.5 mmol/L (CI 5.4–5.5) in 2014. The
decrease was more pronounced in elderly vs. younger participants (1.0 vs. 0.5 mmol/L). In 2014, participants with
previous CVD, diabetes, or hypertension had lower cholesterol levels than the general population, whereas their
levels were higher or similar to the general population in 1994. The use of lipid-lowering drugs increased markedly
and was used by 14.3% in 2014. Previously described differences in cholesterol levels between participants with
obesity and normal weight, and between those with and without university education, diminished, or vanished
over time.
Conclusion
Cholesterol levels decreased by 0.7 mmol/L over 20 years with no sign of abating. The improvement occurred in all age
and gender groups but more prominently among those at high risk of ischaemic heart disease.

From 1994 to 2004, total cholesterol levels declined in the population of northern Sweden, especially among individuals with high cardio-
vascular risk. More intense lipid-lowering drug treatment has contributed to a third of the reduction.

 Introduction
Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) deaths in Sweden have decreased
55–60% due to improved risk factor patterns, mainly lower choles-
terol levels.1 Reduction of total cholesterol by 1 mmol/L is asso-
ciated with 33% lower IHD mortality among those 50–69 years
of age.2 Analyzing trends in cholesterol levels in the population is im-
portant for understanding the dynamics of cardiovascular disease
(CVD), especially in groups more vulnerable to high cholesterol le-
vels, i.e. patients with previous CVD or with risk factors. The im-
portance of the total burden of risk factors is the rationale for
risk estimation models, such as SCORE used for primary
prevention.3
In high-income countries in Western Europe, cholesterol levels
have decreased 0.2 mmol/L per decade since 1980,4 although with
a slower decrease in the USA.5 In northern Sweden, cholesterol le-
vels declined 0.9 mmol/L between 1986 and 2009.6 In the same area,
the Va
¨sterbotten Intervention Program (VIP) corroborated these
findings, but then reported for the first time an increase in choles-
terol levels between 2008 and 2010.7 Diet changes explain most of
the early decrease in cholesterol, and statins have probably contrib-
uted only recently.8–11 The introduction of new diets, such as the
low-carb high-fat (LCHF) diet, could reverse the beneficial trends
towards lower cholesterol levels in the population,11 overturning
the successful primary prevention of IHD.
Our primary aim was to study trends in cholesterol levels be-
tween 1994 and 2014 based on five population surveys. Our sec-
ondary aim was to analyze these trends in relation to age, sex,
prevalent CVD, and its risk factors, and the usage of lipid-lowering
agents.
Methods
Survey participants
This study included 25- to 74-year-old participants in the northern Swe-
den WHO MONICA population-based surveys in 1994, 1999, 2004,
2009, and 2014.6 In each survey, 2500 participants were randomly se-
lected from population registers stratified for sex and 10-year age
groups in the two most northern counties of Sweden. The survey sam-
ples were independent of each other. The participant rate declined con-
tinuously from 76.8% in 1994 to 62.5% in 2014. Younger men and
women have been less prone to participate, and the participation rate
remained high among those older than 45 years of age in 2014 (70.3%).6
Measurements
Blood samples were drawn after at least a 4-h fast and analyzed without
freezing. In 1994, total cholesterol was determined by an enzymatic
method (BM Monotest Cholesterol CHOD-PAP, Boehringer Mann-
heim GmbH, Germany), and since 1999 a dry chemistry method was
used (Vitros 950, Kodak Echtachem, USA).9 The measurement of total
cholesterol is accredited by the national accreditation body, with a CV
of 3.6% at 3.9 mmol/L and 3.1% at 6.7 mmol/L. We defined a desirable
cholesterol level in the population without CVD, diabetes, or hyperten-
sion as ,5.0 mmol/L.3
Blood pressure was measured twice in a sitting position after a 5-min
rest and the mean value recorded. Hypertension was defined as a mean
systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or mean diastolic blood pres-
sure ≥90 mmHg and/or reported use of antihypertensive medication.
Diabetes and previous myocardial infarction or stroke was self-
reported. The highest attained education was used as a proxy for socio-
economic status and dichotomized into university education (yes/no).
Participants who smoked at least one cigarette a day were classified
as regular smokers. Anthropometric measurements were performed
by specially trained nurses using the same standardized methods in all
surveys.6
Statistical methods
Sex- and age-specific mean total cholesterol levels and the proportions
of participants using lipid-lowering drugs were presented with 95% con-
fidence intervals (CIs) based on a normal approximation. The change in
mean levels from 1994 to 2014 was calculated using separate general lin-
ear models for each sex and age strata assuming a linear trend over time.
To test for age group differences in the trend, an additional model in-
cluded all strata and the factors age group, sex, year of survey, and all
corresponding two-way interactions.
Age-adjusted cholesterol levels in subgroups of patients based on
self-reported diabetes (yes/no), hypertension (above/below 140/
90 mmHg with or without medication), BMI (,25, .30), previous
stroke or myocardial infarction (yes/no), and university education
(yes/no) were analyzed by general linear models and presented as esti-
mated marginal means at the mean age of 51 years unless otherwise sta-
ted. Age was included as a continuous covariate in addition to the
categorical factors sex, year of screening, subgroup, sex*subgroup,
year*subgroup, sex*year, and sex*year*subgroup. The proportion of
participants using lipid-lowering drugs was analyzed in a similar way
using a generalized linear model assuming a Poisson distribution and
log link. Data were analyzed as if generated from simple random sample.
P-value of ,0.05 was considered significant. IBM SPSS statistics 22.1 was
used for statistical analyses.
Ethical considerations
This study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved
by the ethical review board in Umea
˚. Informed consent was obtained
from all participants.
Results
A total of 8941 men and women participated in the five surveys be-
tween 1994 and 2014. Cholesterol values were missing for 46 par-
ticipants, resulting in 4546 women and 4349 men being included in
the study.
Overall, the observed mean cholesterol levels decreased ap-
proximately linearly from 6.2 mmol/L (CI 6.1–6.2) in 1994 to
5.5 mmol/L (CI 5.4–5.5) in 2014. The levels decreased among
both women and men and in all age groups (P , 0.001 for all groups;
Figure 1 and Supplementary material online, Table S1). Assuming a
linear trend, the estimated absolute decline in cholesterol levels in
the oldest age group (65–74 years) was 1.1 mmol/L (CI 0.9–1.3) in
women and 1.0 mmol/L (CI 0.8–1.2) in men. The corresponding de-
cline was lower in younger age groups (year-by-age group inter-
action P , 0.001), with a 0.5 mmol/L (CI 0.4–0.7) decline in
women and 0.6 mmol/L (CI 0.3–0.8) decline in men in the youngest
age group (25–34 years). As the cholesterol levels in 1994 were
higher in the oldest age group, the difference in relative change
across age groups was small.
In 2014, 73.2% (CI 64.9–81.5) of all women and 64.1% (CI 54.7–
73.5) of all men in the 25–34 years age group had cholesterol levels

 ,5.0 mmol/L (Supplementary material online, Figure S1). The pro-
portion decreased markedly with higher age, especially in women,
reaching its lowest level in 55- to 64-year-old women (14.4%, CI
9.3–19.6).
In the participants without diabetes, history of stroke, or myocar-
dial infarction, the proportion with cholesterol levels ,5.0 mmol/L
increased from 19.5% (CI 17.0–22.0) in 1994 to 36.6% (CI 33.3–
40.0) in 2014 among women and from 17.8% (CI 15.3–20.2) to
36.7% (CI 33.3–40.2) among men.
Between 1994 and 2014, the observed use of lipid-lowering drugs
in the population increased from 1.4% (CI 0.8–1.9) to 14.3% (CI
12.6–16.1). In 2014, 33.1% (CI 26.2–40.1) of women and 27.5%
(CI 20.9–34.0) of men in the oldest age group (65–74 years)
were using lipid-lowering drugs (Figure 2).
In clinical praxis, statin treatment is expected to lower the total
cholesterol level by an average of 1.5 mmol/L or �30%.8 – 10 We
used 1.5 mmol/L to calculate the hypothetical cholesterol levels in
a population with no medication in 2014: 5.6 mmol/L in women
and 5.7 mmol/L in men (actual levels 5.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, respective-
ly). In the oldest age group (65–74 years), which used lipid-lowering
drugs most frequently, the difference was 6.5 vs. 6.0 mmol/L in wo-
men and 5.9 vs. 5.5 mmol/L in men. A crude estimate8 (proportion
with drugs × effect of drugs in clinical praxis/estimated reduction in
cholesterol level) suggested that lipid-lowering drugs accounted for
≈31% of the reduced cholesterol levels between 1994 and 2014 in
the 25–74 years age group, and ≈44% in the oldest age group (65–
74 years).
Diabetes
The prevalence of self-reported diabetes increased from 3.1% (CI
2.4–3.9) in 1994 to 4.9% (CI 3.8–6.0) in 2014 (P ¼ 0.003, test for
linear trend). Initially, cholesterol levels were similar in participants

 with and without diabetes, though the level declined faster among
those with diabetes (decline between 1994 and 2014: 1.6 mmol/L,
CI 1.0–2.1 vs. 0.9 mmol/L, CI 0.8–1.1; year-by-diabetes interaction
P , 0.001, Figure 3).
The observed use of lipid-lowering drugs in diabetic patients in-
creased from 10.2% (CI 2.2–18.1) in 1994 to 59.7% (CI 48.1–
71.3) in 2014, which is considerably higher than in non-diabetic par-
ticipants (P , 0.001). No difference was found between men and
women with diabetes in regards to the use of lipid-lowering drugs.
Hypertension
Hypertension was less common among women than men (35.9%, CI
34.5–37.3 vs. 45.5%, CI 44.0–47.0), with no clear time trend. In
2014, the participants who achieved normal blood pressure levels
with antihypertensive treatment had the lowest age-adjusted chol-
esterol levels (5.5 mmol/L, CI 5.4–5.6), followed by participants
with high blood pressure despite antihypertensive treatment
(5.7 mmol/L, CI 5.6–5.8), participants with normal levels and no
antihypertensive treatment (5.7 mmol/L, CI 5.7–5.8), and partici-
pants with high blood pressure levels and no antihypertensive treat-
ment (6.0 mmol/L, CI 5.9–6.1; Figure 4).
In participants with hypertension, the use of lipid-lowering
drugs increased from 2.8% (CI 1.6–4.0) in 1994 to 27.6% (CI
24.0–31.0) in 2014. The age-adjusted proportion of participants
using lipid-lowering drugs in 2014 (adjusted to the mean age of
hypertensive participants, 59 years) was higher among hypertensive
participants than among those with normal blood pressure levels
and no antihypertensive treatment (20.3%, CI 17.3–23.9 vs. 8.6%,
CI 6.5–11.4).
Obesity
The prevalence of obesity (BMI . 30) increased from 14.6% (CI
13.0–16.2) in 1994 to 22.4% (CI 20.4–24.5) in 2014. In 1994, obese
participants had higher cholesterol than normal-weight participants
(BMI , 25), but this difference diminished over time (Supplemen-
tary material online, Figure S2). In 2014, obese participants had
even lower cholesterol levels than non-obese participants (BMI ≤
30) in the two oldest age groups (.54 years).
Among obese participants, the observed use of lipid-lowering
drugs increased from 1.1% (CI 0–2.3) in 1994 to 21.2% (CI 16.9–
25.6) in 2014. In 2014, the difference in lipid-lowering drug use be-
tween obese and non-obese participants was pronounced in the
55–64 years age group (34.1%, CI 24.0–44.2 vs. 16.4%, CI 11.8–
21.0) but not significant in other age groups.
Smoking
The prevalence of smokers decreased from 21.0% (CI 19.1–22.8) in
1994 to 7.7% (CI 6.4–9.0) in 2014. The difference in cholesterol le-
vels between smokers and non-smokers was small throughout the
study period (Supplementary material online, Figure S3) and did not
differ in 2014. The proportion of participants using lipid-lowering
drugs did not differ between smokers and non-smokers.
History of myocardial infarction or stroke
The prevalence of previous CVD was 4.9% (CI 4.4–5.4) and did not
change during the period. The estimated mean cholesterol levels
(adjusted to mean age of participants with CVD, 64 years) did not
differ between participants with and without a history of CVD in
1994. In the intervening years, cholesterol levels declined faster in
men and women with CVD than those without (P , 0.001, Figure 5).
In 2014, the estimated levels reached 4.9 mmol/L (CI 4.6–5.2) in
participants with CVD compared with 5.9 mmol/L (CI 5.8–6.0) in
participants without a history of CVD. In parallel, the use of
lipid-lowering drugs increased faster in participants with a history
of CVD (P , 0.001), reaching 49.9% (CI 35.8–69.5) in 2014, com-
pared with 20.0% (CI 17.2–23.2) in participants without CVD (age
adjusted to 64 years).
Education
The proportion of participants with university education increased
from 17.9% (CI 16.2–19.6) in 1994 to 32.7% (CI 30.4–35.1) in 2014.
Cholesterol levels were similar in men with and without university
education throughout the study period. In 1994, women without

 university education had on average 0.5 mmol/L higher cholesterol
levels than women with university education (P , 0.001). However,
cholesterol levels improved faster in women with non-university le-
vels, and the difference was no longer apparent in 2014 (Supplemen-
tary material online, Figure S4). Treatment with lipid-lowering drugs
did not differ between participants with and without university
education.
Discussion
From 1994 to 2014, total cholesterol levels continuously decreased
among the population of Northern Sweden in all age and gender
groups. More pronounced improvement in cholesterol was evident
in groups with an increased risk of CVD and in women with lower
education. In 2014, treatment with lipid-lowering drugs contributed
modestly to lower cholesterol levels, but among the oldest age
group such treatment was estimated to decrease cholesterol by
0.5 mmol/L. The more extensive use of lipid-lowering drugs in par-
ticipants with diabetes and CVD may explain most of the greater de-
cline in cholesterol levels.
Cholesterol levels are decreasing in the Western world, though
no studies have included data beyond 2010.4,6,7,10 In Northern
Sweden, cholesterol levels decreased by 0.3 mmol/L per decade,
more than the 0.2 mmol/L per decade reported in the meta-analysis
by the Global Burden of Disease group.4
Changes in diet have been the major driving force in northern
Sweden in the MONICA and VIP studies,11 with decreasing intake
of both total fat and saturated fat up to 2004. During 2008–2010,
the trend of decreasing cholesterol levels in the VIP study was re-
versed7 and a causal link between changes in diet and levels of chol-
esterol seemed feasible. The widespread introduction of the LCHF
diet was suggested to influence the mean levels in the whole

 population.11 However, a recent update from the VIP study12 de-
scribed decreasing values. Therefore, it is likely that the LCHF diet
peaked before 2014 and a transient effect on cholesterol levels was
not detected by the MONICA study sampling only in 2009 and
2014. Within the MONICA study diet patterns have been compared
in 1986 and 200413 and a decrease in intake of all types of fat was
observed. Furthermore, there was an increase in intake of fiber
from fruits, vegetables, and grains. Thus, improvements in diet prob-
ably contributed to the decrease in cholesterol.
Cholesterol levels decreased in both men and women and in all
age groups to a similar (relative) extent, though the absolute de-
crease was markedly greater among the oldest age group, in which
the use of statins strongly contributed. This finding is in accordance
with our previous report extending back to 1986.9
Half of the improvement in cholesterol levels in the UK and al-
most all of the improvement in the USA is due to statins.8 In
2008, the effect of statins on population levels in Iceland was esti-
mated to be 1–2%,10 in line with the 2% we reported from nor-
thern Sweden in 20049 and lower than the 31% in this report.
Among the elderly, the effect was even greater, 44% in 2014, which
is also much higher than the reported 6% in Iceland in 2008.10 The
important public health message from this study is that, even after
many years of decreasing cholesterol levels, there are still possibil-
ities for further improvement by diet modifications, and statin
treatment in selected groups.1
Although a high cholesterol level is an independent cardiovascu-
lar risk factor, the risk at any given level depends on the occurrence
or level of other risk factors. Therefore, CVD risk estimation mod-
els, such as SCORE,3 also take into account age, sex, systolic blood
pressure, and smoking. For an effective high-risk strategy for the pre-
vention of CVD, the cholesterol levels and trends among individuals
with other cardiovascular risk factors are important but seldom
reported.
For patients with diabetes, specific risk prediction models have
been constructed from national cohorts of diabetes patients,14
which give cholesterol levels a central role. The causal link between
lower cholesterol levels due to statin treatment and less CVD in dia-
betic patients was finally settled in 2002,15 leading many guidelines
to propose statins to all patients with type 2 diabetes. In Northern
Sweden, 60% of all patients with diabetes are now treated with sta-
tins resulting in almost 1 mmol/L lower cholesterol than in the non-
diabetic population. Together with lower blood pressure, this is
probably the most important explanation for better survival among
Swedish diabetics with myocardial infarction.16
Treatment of hypertension reduces the risk of CVD by 25–30%,
whereas adding statins can further reduce the risk by 35–40%.17,18
In the USA, concomitant control of both hypertension and hyper-
cholesterolemia has improved since 1988, but in 2010 only
one-third of the hypertensive population adequately controlled
both risk factors.17 Hypertensive participants with adequate blood
pressure control in this study had the lowest cholesterol levels, and
levels declined faster among drug-treated hypertensives, lending
support to the quality of primary health care in Sweden. However,
we also noted remove the highest cholesterol levels among partici-
pants with high blood pressure without treatment, a group with very
high predicted CVD risk. Identifying these individuals should be of
the utmost importance.
Whether being overweight and obese is associated with higher
mortality is being debated.19 The disagreement may be due to the
fact that the prevalence of ‘metabolic health’ among obese persons
has increased.20 We previously reported higher total cholesterol le-
vels in obese participants.9 This difference was not observed when
we extended the observation to 2014, which was explained to a
large extent by statins being prescribed to one-third of middle-aged
obese participants.
We did not find any difference in cholesterol levels between smo-
kers and non-smokers. However, this could be misleading as HDL
was not measured and a smoking-induced HDL reduction with a
more detrimental HDL/LDL ratio could not be detected.21
The importance of lowering cholesterol levels after a myocardial
infarction is highlighted in contemporary treatment guidelines.3
Despite this, many patients with known coronary heart disease
(CHD) still have elevated cholesterol levels.22 The proportion of
Swedish patients with LDL ,2.5 mmol/L 1 year after a coronary
event increased only marginally between 2005 and 2012,23 probably
due to low adherence to statins. In 2009, only 56% of patients with
ischaemic stroke remained on statins 2 years after the event.24 We
found a much faster decrease in cholesterol levels in patients with
stroke and/or myocardial infarction than in the general population.
A 1.6 mmol/L decrease in cholesterol levels among CHD patients
between 1986 and 2002 prevented 1350 deaths.1
Low education is a strong predictor of IHD,25 and its inclusion in
SCORE improved the accuracy of risk estimation,26 partly due to
higher cholesterol levels among people with low education.9 In
the USA, the disparity gap in cholesterol was stable.27 Recent stud-
ies from Scandinavia have presented data up to 2010 and found
stable28 or diminishing7,29 educational inequalities in cholesterol le-
vels as well as a levelling off.30 We found no differences according to
education among men, and the higher cholesterol initially noted
among women with low education were not present in 2014. This
is encouraging and supports the joint efforts of society and health
care in achieving a healthier life style and that they have also reached
deprived groups.
It was previously estimated that declining cholesterol by 1 mmol/l
would lead to 23% lower CVD mortality.2 According to the Swedish
cause of death register, CVD mortality did decrease by 49% from
1997 to 2014 in the 25–74 age span in the region. A modelling study
from Sweden supports that declining population levels of choles-
terol levels explain half of the reduction in CVD mortality.1
A possible limitation is the change of laboratory methods or a
drift in measurements over time. However, the assays used have
been carefully quality assured by the national accreditation body
throughout the survey period. The change in methods between
1994 and 1999 led to 1.4% higher values, and previous measure-
ments have been corrected accordingly. Decreasing attendance, es-
pecially among the youngest age group, is a possible problem, but as
the youngest age group had the lowest cholesterol levels, the true
level in the population may even be lower than that reported in this
study. The change in mean cholesterol levels from 1994to 2014 was
estimated assuming a linear trend, and this estimate may be biased if
the linearity assumption is violated. However, the estimated change
was similar to the observed difference comparing the surveys 1994
and 2014, suggesting no major bias. The strength of this study is the
repeated measurements with standardized and quality controlled

 methods in a very stable population within a well-defined geograph-
ical area. Although total cholesterol levels have shown good predict-
ive value in epidemiological studies, it is advisable in the individual
patient also to evaluate other lipoproteins such as LDL and HDL,

Conclusion
Total cholesterol levels in the population of northern Sweden have
declined 0.7 mmol/L over 20 years. The improvement occurred in
all age and gender groups, but more prominently in those at high
cardiovascular risk and in women with low education. More intense
lipid-lowering drug treatment was estimated to contribute to a third
of the reduction. However, there were still high-risk participants
with non-satisfactory cholesterol levels without lipid-lowering
drugs. This study underscores the importance of surveillance of car-
diovascular risk factors in the population, as improvements are the
most effective way to combat CVD.

Chinese herbal drug natural indigo may cause pulmonary artery
hypertension

A 45-year-old woman was admitted due to in-
creasing dyspnoea, chest oppression, and leg oe-
dema in December 2015. She had a 5-year history
of ulcerative colitis (UC) and had been taking the
herbal medicine natural indigo (NI) at 2 g/day for
6 months. No abnormalities had been detected at
a medical check-up 3 months before admission.
On admission, transthoracic echocardiography
revealed typical systolic flattening of the interven-
tricular septum (Panel A) with a dilated right ven-
tricle and severe tricuspid regurgitation (Panel B),
indicating severe pulmonary artery hypertension
(PAH). Electrocardiogram-gated contrast-enhanced
computed tomography revealed a dilated right
ventricle without pulmonary embolism (Panels C
and D). No cardiovascular anomaly or arteri-
ovenous shunt was detected on transoesopha-
geal echocardiography. After diuretic treatment
for 6 days, catheterization revealed PAH (58/
25 mmHg; mean, 36 mmHg) and high PA resist-
ance (689 dyn s cm25) with normal pulmonary
capillary wedge and left ventricular end-diastolic
pressures (5 mmHg, respectively). From the phy-
sical examinations and laboratory data, collagen
diseases were considered unlikely. The lympho-
cyte transformation test, which indicates drug allergy, showed a positive reaction for NI, suggesting NI as a possible cause of PAH.
Although symptoms were improved after diuretic therapy, estimated PA systolic pressure after discontinuing NI for 1 month remained
high (58 mmHg). Careful observation and additional medication are needed.
Natural indigo, an unapproved Chinese herbal drug used for UC, has been reported as effective against intractable UC, and clinical
trials are ongoing. Although no causative relationship between NI and PAH has been established, clinicians should recognize a potential
association between NI and PAH.
