Abstract
Background—Studies in vitro demonstrate that neuronal membrane/lipid rafts (MLRs) establish 
cell polarity by clustering pro-growth receptors and tethering cytoskeletal machinery necessary for 
neuronal sprouting. However, the effect of MLR and MLR-associated proteins on neuronal aging 
is unknown.
Methods—Here we assessed the impact of neuron-targeted overexpression of a MLR scaffold 
protein, caveolin-1 (via a synapsin promoter; SynCav1), in the hippocampus in vivo in adult (6-
months-old) and aged (20-month-old) mice on biochemical, morphologic and behavioral changes.
Results—SynCav1 resulted in increased expression of Cav-1, MLRs, and MLR-localization of 
Cav-1 and tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor independent of age and time post gene 
transfer. Cav-1 overexpression in adult mice enhanced dendritic arborization within the apical

 dendrites of hippocampal CA1 and granule cell neurons, effects that were also observed in aged 
mice, albeit to a lesser extent, indicating preserved impact of Cav-1 on structural plasticity of 
hippocampal neurons with age. Cav-1 overexpression enhanced contextual fear memory in adult 
and aged mice demonstrating improved hippocampal function.
Conclusions—Neuron-targeted overexpression of Cav-1 in the adult and aged hippocampus 
enhances functional MLRs with corresponding roles in cell signaling and protein trafficking. The 
resultant structural alterations in hippocampal neurons in vivo are associated with improvements in 
hippocampal dependent learning and memory. Our findings suggest Cav-1 as a novel therapeutic 
strategy in disorders involving impaired hippocampal function.

Introduction
Synaptic plasticity occurs when endogenous neurotrophins and neurotransmitters bind to 
membrane receptors in neuronal microdomains to initiate neuritogenesis. Key plasmalemmal 
organizers and regulators of these pro-growth signaling events are membrane/lipid rafts 
(MLRs), which are discrete plasmalemmal regions enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids, 
and scaffolding proteins such as caveolins (Cavs) and flotillins (1-3). MLRs found at the 
leading edge of polarized neurites (1, 4) are essential for neurite growth and guidance (5, 6), 
synapse formation/stabilization (7). Cav-1 organizes a multitude of neuronal receptors (3, 8, 
9) and modulators of cytoskeletal dynamics (10-13). Loss or disruption of MLRs from the 
leading edge of neuronal growth cones results in growth cone collapse and inhibition of 
neuritogenesis (14, 15), indicating the functional significance of MLRs in neuronal survival 
and differentiation as well as numerous synaptic functions.
Neurotrophins, such as nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), 
neurotrophin (NT)-3, and NT-4, are capable of binding to specific tropomyosin-related 
kinase (Trk) receptors and to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (16, 17). Binding of NTs to 
cognate Trk receptors results in the activation and recruitment of a number of downstream 
signaling proteins that are involved in neurotransmission, neuronal survival and 
differentiation, and retrograde signaling of developing and mature neurons (18, 19). Notably, 
the localization of Trk receptors to specific neuronal microdomains has been suggested to be 
crucial for determining the biological functions of neurotrophins. For example, recent in 
vitro and ex vivo studies have indicated that TrkB at synaptic sites are localized in MLRs 
(20-25), suggesting a role for lipid rafts in TrkB signaling. Furthermore, the localization of 
TrkB to MLRs is functionally important for BDNF-induced downstream signaling and 
neuronal plasticity in isolated corticohippocampal neurons (25). Supporting this study, 
previous work from our group demonstrated that neuron-targeted Cav-1 overexpression in 
corticohippocampal neurons enhanced MLR formation, increased pro-growth signaling 
(TrkB signaling, receptor-mediated cAMP formation), and promoted dendritic growth and 
arborization of primary neurons (9). However, whether Cav-1 overexpression-induced 
enhanced neuronal signaling and functional plasticity occurs in vivo is unknown, and the 
importance of Cav-1 overexpression in cognitive improvement has not been investigated.

 With age there exists a greater vulnerability to cognitive deficits (26-28). Structural and 
functional changes in the aged brain that may underlie these deficits include a reduction in 
the number of synapses in the hippocampus (a brain region important for cognitive 
function), impairment in long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal neurons, and a 
reduced capacity of the hippocampal neurons to evoke neuroplasticity (27, 29-31). 
Restoration of molecular signals that assist with structural and functional plasticity in the 
hippocampus might protect against age related cognitive decline. To that end, identification 
and targeting of the molecular events that promote neuronal survival and differentiation as 
well as associated synaptic functions in the hippocampus may yield new therapies to 
enhance functional neuroplasticity, thereby attenuating aged related cognitive dysfunction 
dependent on the hippocampus. In the context of this hypothesis, plasmalemmal 
organization and subcellular distribution of receptors and downstream signaling components 
essential for neuronal signaling and plasticity are altered with age (32-34), thus limiting the 
functional efficacy of neurotrophins. Because MLRs organize synaptic receptors necessary 
for plasticity, genetic interventions that enhance neuronal MLR formation may promote 
neuroplasticity dependent on MLR-neurotrophin signaling and reverse age-related cognitive 
decline. Therefore, we tested whether in vivo delivery of neuron-targeted Cav-1 in the aged 
hippocampus would enhance neurotrophin (TrkB)-induced signaling, structural plasticity of 
hippocampal neurons and improve hippocampal cognition in aged mice. The findings from 
the present study provide in vivo evidence to show that a single genetic intervention that 
increases MLRs in adult and aged subjects promotes molecular signals governing 
neuroplasticity, enhances structural plasticity of hippocampal neurons and improves 
hippocampal-dependent cognitive function.
Materials and Methods
Animals
All mice (C57BL/6; Jackson Laboratories) were treated in compliance with the Guide for 
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Academy of Science, Washington, D.C.). 
All animal use protocols were approved by the Veterans Administration San Diego 
Healthcare System Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, San Diego, 
California) prior to procedures performed. Male adult (4 month) or aged (10 month) mice 
were housed under normal conditions with ad libitum access to food and water and received 
stereotaxic injections of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) (at 4-month-old or 10-
month-old, discussed below) and were tested for cognitive behaviors at 6 or 20 months of 
age (Figure 1). Two weeks after behavior testing all mice were euthanized by rapid 
decapitation and brain tissue was processed for western blotting or Golgi-Cox staining. 
Additional details on methods are provided in the supporting information.
Stereotactic Injection
Mice were anesthetized and prepared for sugery with a protocol modified from a previously 
described study (35). Hippocampal-targeted injections were controlled using Injectomate 
software (Neurostar – Berlin, Germany). Injections were made using a 33 gauge 10 l 
Hamilton Gas Tight syringe. At each coordinate, the needle was lowered at a rate of 0.32 
mm/sec. After 60 sec, 0.5 l of AAV9 containing synapsin-red fluorescent protein (SynRFP)

 or synapsin-caveolin-1 (SynCav1) was injected over 60 sec (0.5 μl/min injection rate at a 
viral titer of 109 g.c./μl) at 3 locations (rostral to caudal) in each hippocampal hemisphere 
with an indwelling time of 1 min. Sagital brain sections were stained to confirm location and 
spread of RFP protein in adult (data not shown) and aged (supplementary figure 1) animals. 
Sections were also stained for hematoxylin and eosin, and histopathological analysis did not 
reveal any gross morphology or cell death in hippocampal sections from adult and aged mice 
(supplementary figure 1).
Biochemical characterization of membrane/lipid rafts
Mice were sacrificed by rapid decapitation under isoflurane (5%) anesthesia. The whole 
brain was quickly removed and hippocampal tissue (bilateral, CA regions and dentate gyrus 
combined, 50-100 mg) was dissected and homogenized using a carbonate lysis buffer (500 
mM sodium carbonate, pH 11.0) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (33). 
Protein was quantified by Bradford assay and normalized to 0.5 mg/ml. Sucrose density 
gradients were prepared as previously reported (9). Membranes samples (f4-5 and f10-12) 
were incubated overnight with primary antibodies for Cav-1 (Cell Signaling #3238, 1:1000), 
TrkB (BD Biosciences 610102, 1:1000), or CT-B (Invitrogen C-22841, 1:1000) and probed 
with species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP. Densitometric analysis 
(arbitrary units) was conducted as previously described (33).
Golgi-Cox impregnation
Mice were sacrificed by rapid decapitation (5% isoflurane) and whole brain was quickly 
removed and submerged in Golgi-Cox solution A + B (FD Neurotechnologies Inc.) for 8 
days at room temperature, followed by solution C for 4 days at room temperature and stored 
at −80°C until processed for staining. Frozen brain tissue was coronally cut on a cryostat at 
80-μm-thick sections and stained with solution D + E and dehydrated according to 
manufacturer's instructions. To evaluate hippocampal neuron morphology, a Zeiss 
AxioImager microscope and a computer-based system (Neurolucida; Micro-BrightField) 
were used to generate three dimensional neuron tracings that were subsequently visualized 
and analyzed using NeuroExplorer (MicroBrightField). For each animal, two to five CA1 
pyramidal neurons and three to four dentate gyrus (DG) granule cell neurons were traced at 
40x magnification with an oil immersion lens (equipped with a 10x eye piece) (Fig. 3a-e and 
4a-c). For CA1 neurons, both the apical and basal dendrites were traced, whereas for DG 
neurons only apical dendrites were traced and morphological measurements were analyzed 
separately as described by Kim et al 2014 (36).
Fear conditioning behavior
Fear conditioning was performed as previously described (37, 38). Foot shocks were 
delivered through the floor consisting of 36 stainless steel rods wired to a shock generator. 
Presentation of unconditioned stimuli (US: scrambled foot shock) and conditioned stimuli 
(CS: auditory tone) were controlled by computer (Med Associates Inc.). Freezing was 
determined using analysis software (Video Freeze®, Med Associates Inc., ANY-MAZE, San 
Diego Instruments). Training: After an acclimation period (2 min), mice were presented with 
a tone (CS: 90 dB, 5 kHz) for 30s that co-terminated with a foot shock (US: 2.0s, 1.0 mA) in 
dark chambers. A total of three tone-shock pairings were presented with a varying intertrial

 interval of 30-90s. Freezing was measured during each CS to measure fear acquisition level 
across groups. Context fear was tested twenty-four hours later. Cued fear was tested twenty-
four hours after context fear. To remove contextual cues, the chambers were altered across 
several dimensions (odor - scent; visual – light chambers and walls are altered via plastic 
inserts; tactile - new floor covering) to minimize generalization from the conditioning 
context. The session started with a 3 min acclimation period, during which time no tones 
were presented (“pre-tone” period), then 10 blocks of 5 CSs were presented for 30s each 
with an inter-trial interval of 5s. Freezing was recorded during each CS presentation. For 
analysis, total freezing was averaged as total freezing during all CS presentations.
Statistical analyses
Data were checked for normal distribution and then analyzed with 2-way ANOVA, Mann-
Whitney or student's t-test. Following significant effects with 2-way ANOVA, unpaired t-
tests were performed as appropriate. For the analysis we used GraphPad Prism 6 (La Jolla, 
CA). Data are compared as SynRFP versus SynCav1 and presented as mean ± SEM. 
Significance was assumed when p ≤ 0.05. Experimental groups were blinded to the 
experimenters and code was broken only for analysis.
Results
SynCav1 significantly enhances TrkB, CT-B and Cav-1 in adult and aged hippocampal MLR 
fractions
To test whether SynCav1 gene delivery in vivo increased MLR formation in adult and aged 
mice (Figure 1), hippocampal tissue was homogenized and subjected to sucrose density 
fractionation followed by Western blot analysis. Whole hippocampal tissue homogenates 
demonstrated a significant increase in Cav-1 protein expression in both adult (~ 1.8 fold over 
SynRFP; t8 = 3.55; p = 0.008; n = 5/group; Figure 2A) and aged (~ 9.7 fold over SynRFP; t7 
= 6.45; p < 0.001; n = 4-5/group; Figure 2C) brains after SynCav1 gene delivery. No 
significant change in TrkB whole hippocampal homogenate was found in either adult 
(Figure 2A) or aged (Figure 2C) brains. Sucrose density fractionation of these hippocampal 
homogenates revealed a significant increase in TrkB expression, CT-B binding (indicative of 
increased gangliosides and MLR formation), and Cav-1 expression in the MLR fraction of 
adult (Figure 2B; TrkB: t8 = 3.17; p = 0.01; CT-B: t8 = 2.64; p = 0.03; Cav-1: t8 = 3.00; p = 
0.02; n = 5/group) and aged mice (Figure 2D; TrkB: t7 = 3.37; p = 0.01; CT-B: t8 = 7.83; p < 
0.001; Cav-1: t6 = 4.38; p = 0.005; n = 3-5/group), indicating that SynCav1 overexpression 
produced significant biochemical and subcellular changes in the hippocampus of both adult 
and aged mice compared with SynRFP overexpression.
SynCav1 enhances dendritic arborization of CA1 and DG neurons in the hippocampus in 
adult and aged mice
In adult mice, three-dimensional Sholl analysis of CA1 (Figure 3A-E) and DG (Figure 4A-
C) neurons from each group (n = 4-6 mice/group, 2-5 neurons per animal) demonstrated that 
SynCav1 significantly increased dendrite arborization in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Figure 
3F-G; effect of Cav-1, apical: F1,388 = 13.82, p < 0.001; basal: F1,200 = 4.2, p = 0.04 by 2-
way ANOVA), and increased total basal dendrite length (Figure 3H; t37 = 2.90; p = 0.006 by

 unpaired t test) with no significant difference in total apical dendrite length (p = 0.89). 
Enhanced arborization was evident in apical dendritic segments 70 μm (p = 0.001), 90 μm (p 
= 0.009), and 190 μm (p = 0.02) from soma and basal dendritic segments 130 μm (p = 0.02) 
from soma by unpaired t test. SynCav1 did not alter the number of dendritic spines on CA1 
apical dendrites (number of spines per 10 μm: 16.9 ± 0.74 vs 18.9 ± .81; t30 = 1.89; p = 
0.07) nor basal dendrites (number of spines per 10 μm: 18.1 ± .67 vs 18.4 ± .75; t30 = 0.25; p 
= 0.80). In aged mice, SynCav1 significantly increased CA1 apical dendrite arborization 
(Figure 3I; effect of Cav-1, F1,166 = 4.8, p = 0.03; by 2-way ANOVA), without altering 
arborization within basal dendrites (Figure 3J; effect of Cav-1, p = 0.29) and total apical (p = 
0.20) or basal (p = 0.32) dendrite length of CA1 neurons (Figure 3K). Enhanced arborization 
was evident in apical dendritic segment 70 μm from soma (p = 0.05 by unpaired t test).
Within the dentate gyrus, SynCav1 significantly increased apical dendrite arborization in the 
DG neurons (effect of Cav-1, F1,318 = 3.85, p = 0.05 by 2-way ANOVA, Figure 4D), with no 
difference in soma-tip distance (Figure 4E; p = 0.67) in adult mice. Enhanced arborization 
was evident in apical dendritic segments at 210 μm from soma (p = 0.03). SynCav1 did not 
alter the apical dendrite arborization in the DG neurons of aged mice (Figure 4F; effect of 
Cav-1, p = 0.75) nor soma to tip distance (Figure 4G; p = 0.11).
SynCav1 enhances contextual fear memory dependent on the hippocampus in adult and 
aged mice
Mice were weighed and baseline tested for gross motor function and anxiety in the open 
field paradigm to exclude any obvious dysfunction before testing learning and memory 
behaviors (supplementary figure 3; all p > 0.05). To assess the behavioral consequence of 
SynCav1, we performed hippocampal injections with either SynCav1 or SynRFP in young 
adult mice (4 month) and then monitored the mice at 6 months (2 month post gene delivery) 
in the fear conditioning paradigm (Figure 5A-C). We performed an unpaired t-test on 
baseline freezing, context freezing, and cued freezing measures after testing for normality 
and exclusion of outliers using ROUT's method (Q = 1%). A 2-way ANOVA with gene as 
the between subject factor and tone as a within subject factor was performed for percent 
freezing during the learning phase on day 1. Fear conditioning revealed no baseline 
difference in freezing behavior between groups (SynRFP: 3.88 ± 0.61 vs SynCav1: 5.47 
± 0.62; t25 = 1.83; p = 0.08; n = 13-14/group) and during the acquisition period, indicated by 
no significant effect of ‘gene’ (F1,25 = 1.58, p = 0.22) or ‘time * gene’ - interaction (F2,50 = 
0.12, p = 0.89) (Figure 5D; n = 13-14/group) by repeated measure 2-way ANOVA. In both 
groups, similar increases in freezing over time with repeated CS-US pairing trials were 
apparent (F2,50 = 56.64, p < 0.001). On day 2, SynCav1-injected mice showed significantly 
increased freezing response during the contextual recall test, an effect specific to 
hippocampal-dependent learning and memory (39) (Figure 5E; t26 = 2.19; p = 0.037; n = 14/
group). No significant difference between groups was observed during exposure to the cue in 
an altered context on day 3 (Figure 5F; p = 0.12; n = 14/group).
To assess the behavioral consequence of SynCav1 in aged mice (Figure 5G-I), we performed 
hippocampal injections with either SynCav1 or SynRFP in middle aged mice (10 month) 
and then monitored the mice at 20 months (10 month post gene deliver) in the fear

freezing, and cued freezing measures after testing for normality and exclusion of outliers 
using ROUT's method (Q=1%). A 2-way ANOVA with group as the between subject factor 
and trial as a within subject factor was performed for percent freezing during the learning 
phase on day 1. Fear conditioning revealed no baseline difference between groups (SynRFP: 
7.80 ± 1.18 vs SynCav1: 8.55 ± 1.27; t33 = 0.44; p = 0.66; n = 17-18/group) and responses 
during the acquisition period, represented by no significant effect of ‘gene’ (F1,35 = 0.01, p = 
0.92) or ‘time * gene’ - interaction (F2,70 = 0.47, p = 0.62; Figure 5G; n = 17-20/group) by 
repeated measures 2-way ANOVA. In both groups, similar increases in freezing over time 
with repeated CS-US pairing trials were apparent (F2,70 = 98.36, p < 0.001). On day 2, 
SynCav1-injected mice showed significantly increased freezing response during the 
contextual recall test, an effect specific to hippocampal-dependent learning and memory (39) 
(Figure 5H; t33 = 2.52; p = 0.017; n = 17-18/group). No significant difference between 
groups was observed during exposure to the cue in an altered context on day 3 (Figure 5I; t34 
= 1.23; p = 0.23; n = 17-19/group).
Discussion
Although previous work has shown that markers of MLRs, such as CT-B (40, 41) and/or 
flotillins (42, 43), are elevated during neuronal sprouting and repair after CNS trauma, the 
functional significance of overexpression of a MLR-associated scaffold protein, Cav-1, in 
the adult and aged brain is unknown. In this study, we have demonstrated that hippocampus-
targeted overexpression of Cav-1 in adult and aged mice recruits TrkB receptors to MLRs in 
the hippocampus. These molecular events were accompanied by morphological alterations 
in hippocampal neurons, visualized as enhanced dendritic arborization within apical 
dendrites in adult and aged mice, indicating enhanced structural plasticity of these neurons. 
Moreover, the molecular and structural changes in the hippocampus in animals 
overexpressing Cav-1 specifically in neurons were associated with improved hippocampal-
dependent behavior, suggesting direct functional effects from Cav-1 on neuroplasticity and 
memory. Furthermore, our biochemical findings demonstrate that Cav-1 regulates the 
subcellular distribution of TrkB towards membrane microdomains (i.e., MLRs) in vivo, a 
cellular event necessary for TrkB activation, which in turn promotes structural plasticity and 
improves cognitive function. Although the mechanism underlying Cav-1-induced TrkB 
relocation to MLRs in vivo is not known, Cav-1 may regulate TrkB endocytosis and 
recycling as suggested by recent in vitro evidence for Cav-1 mediated increases in TrkB 
activation (i.e., phosphorylation) and MLR localization via enhanced sphingolipids and Rac-
mediated signaling (44).
In the adult mammalian brain, inhibitory/repulsive molecules present a major obstacle for 
nerve regeneration after injury and diseases (45). Thus, understanding neurotrophin-induced 
signal transduction mechanisms in the context of neuronal growth and guidance will provide 
potential strategies to combat growth inhibition of regenerating nerve fibers. For many 
guidance cues, the formation of ligand-receptor complexes on the plasma membrane in 
neuronal subdomains represents the first step in signal transduction, followed by additional 
cellular events that result in synaptic plasticity (46). The fact that these important events 
occur at or within the plasma membrane suggests that the membrane lipid environment is

 crucial for signal transduction of these extracellular cues. Notably, recent in vitro data 
indicates that the lipid environment of the plasma membrane plays a role in guidance 
signaling, and membrane components including MLRs are important for functional receptor-
signaling complexes to generate specific signaling cascades for distinct dendritic and axonal 
responses (1, 3, 47-49). Furthermore, BDNF-TrkB signaling within MLRs plays a role in 
chemotrophic guidance of nerve growth cones in adult brain and neurons isolated from adult 
cortex, indicating a functional role for MLRs in mediating localized signal transduction 
during growth cone guidance (24, 50, 51). In the adult rodent brain, BDNF is heavily 
expressed in the hippocampus, which is the anatomical component of learning and memory, 
and hippocampal neurons undergo several forms of plasticity during adulthood (27, 29, 52).
Importantly, the present findings in adult mice demonstrate that neuron-specific 
overexpression of Cav-1 in the hippocampus induces recruitment of TrkB receptors to MLRs 
and produces enhancements in dendritic structure of hippocampal neurons and hippocampal 
dependent behaviors. The observation that overexpression of Cav-1 in the hippocampus of 
adult mice significantly enhanced CA1 apical and basal dendrite arborization and total spine 
density in the stratum radiatum and stratum oriens and enhanced granule cell apical dendritic 
arborization approximately 150-200 μm distal from soma indicates that functional MLRs 
promote structural and potentially functional plasticity (53). These results suggest a novel 
strategy of enhancing neuroplasticity in the aged hippocampus that specifically rely on 
manipulation of MLRs and their associated components (including neurotrophins, current 
findings, and other MLR-associated glutamatergic receptor systems (9).
It is possible that genetic interventions that increase MLRs and concurrently neuronal 
structural plasticity have the potential to improve behavior in the aged brain. For example, a 
key brain region that is impaired during aging is the hippocampus (27). The aging brain 
demonstrates region-specific alterations in neuronal morphology, reduced structural 
plasticity (30, 31) and dendritic branching (54), and a decreased capacity to regenerate (27, 
55). With age the brain undergoes changes in plasma membrane biophysical properties (i.e., 
decreased cholesterol, gangliosides, and phosphoinositides) (56), impaired cholesterol 
synthesis and lipoprotein transport (55), changes in the molecular composition of the 
postsynaptic membrane (54) accompanied with reduced MLR-associated synaptic proteins 
(57), and diminished pre-synaptic vesicle exocytosis and subsequent neurotransmitter 
release; the latter are due to cholesterol depletion or cholesterol redistribution from cyto to 
exofacial leaflet of the plasma membrane ultimately leading to altered recruitment of 
SNARE complexes (56). Akin to these findings, previous work from our group 
demonstrated that Cav-1 and synaptic components (e.g., PSD-95, NMDAR, AMPAR, TrkB) 
are decreased in the aged brain, specifically in synaptosomes and MLRs isolated from the 
hippocampus (33, 54). Age-related changes in membrane lipid composition and concomitant 
reduction in functional synaptic components (both pre- and post-synaptic) may contribute to 
the maladaptive plasticity of the aged brain. Although some therapeutic approaches attempt 
to initiate structural and functional plasticity through delivery of exogenous pro-growth 
stimuli (such as neurotrophins (58)), the lack of efficacy may be due to the absence of 
receptors and their downstream effector molecules from the appropriate plasma membrane 
microdomains. Therefore, interventions that promote MLR formation in neurons may 
enhance the signaling efficacy of endogenous neurotransmitters and neurotrophins that

 converge upon pro-growth signaling. The present findings show through neuroanatomical 
and biochemical analysis of hippocampal tissue from aged mice that underwent cognitive 
testing that Cav-1 overexpression significantly enhanced dendritic arborization of CA1 
hippocampal neurons in the stratum radiatum of aged mice, results similar to that seen in the 
adult mice. Furthermore, Cav-1 overexpression in aged animals enhanced hippocampal 
Cav-1 expression and MLR formation (as indicated by CT-B binding to GM1 gangliosides), 
and TrkB localization to MLR fractions. These findings in aged animals show that neuron-
targeted overexpression of Cav-1 enhances MLR formation, TrkB recruitment to MLRs and 
structural plasticity of hippocampal neurons, which perhaps produces neuritogenesis and 
synapse maintenance/stabilization.
Certain cognitive abilities such as executive function, episodic memory, working memory, 
short-term recollection, the speed of processing new information, and spatial memory that 
are dependent on the hippocampus are greatly compromised with age (27, 59). These age-
related changes render the older brain more susceptible to other forms of neurodegenerative 
disorders like Alzheimer's disease (26, 27, 60). Several studies have suggested that decreases 
in synapses and total neuronal loss within regions of the hippocampus more closely correlate 
with hippocampal dependent cognitive impairment (26, 39). Contextual memory is 
multisensory and hippocampal-dependent, and involves a combination of spatial, temporal, 
interoceptive (e.g., hormonal, hunger, stress), cognitive (i.e., understanding the encoding), 
and social (i.e., understanding the world around us) processing. Therefore, we performed a 
fear-conditioning paradigm on aged mice (20 month) and found that Cav-1 overexpresssion 
in the hippocampus significantly enhanced hippocampal-dependent contextual fear memory, 
but not cued fear memory. The latter is predominantly regulated by the amygdala and medial 
prefrontal cortex (39). A minor limitation of the present study is that a behavioral test was 
used that did not demonstrate an aging-induced deficit in hippocampal dependent memory 
(no difference between adult and aged mice in context and cued freezing behavior). 
Therefore we speculate that Cav-1 overexpression could potentially improve behaviors that 
are impaired in aged subjects. Nevertheless, these behavioral findings reaffirm the 
biochemical and neuroanatomical results and extend the notion that Cav-1 overexpression 
enhances structural and perhaps functional hippocampal plasticity, and ultimately improves 
cognitive function.
Restoration of synaptic plasticity and preservation of cognitive function in the aged brain 
remains a major medical challenge. Understanding how age-related changes affect synaptic 
membrane protein clustering within neurons may yield therapeutic targets for the purpose of 
restoring functional MLR, neuronal membrane expansion, and synapse formation that is 
necessary to promote functional plasticity and reverse age-related behavioral decline. 
Genetic interventions that re-establish the proper subcellular membrane regions necessary to 
restore pro-growth and pro-survival signaling have the potential to increase the efficacy of 
pharmacologic agents designed to improve functional outcomes. The ability of Cav-1 to 
significantly enhance functional hippocampal neuronal growth and plasticity and improve 
hippocampal-dependent (i.e., contextual) learning and memory in aged mice holds 
considerable potential as a novel therapeutic to restore brain function during the aging 
process.
