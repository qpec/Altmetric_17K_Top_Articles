ABSTRACT
Conventionally, mouse hybridomas or well-plate screening are used to identify therapeutic monoclonal
antibody candidates. In this study, we present an alternative to hybridoma-based discovery that combines
microfluidics, yeast single-chain variable fragment (scFv) display, and deep sequencing to rapidly
interrogate and screen mouse antibody repertoires. We used our approach on six wild-type mice to
identify 269 molecules that bind to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), which were present at an
average of 1 in 2,000 in the pre-sort scFv libraries. Two rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
produced populations of PD-1-binding scFv with a mean enrichment of 800-fold, whereas most scFv
present in the pre-sort mouse repertoires were de-enriched. Therefore, our work suggests that most of the
antibodies present in the repertoires of immunized mice are not strong binders to PD-1. We observed
clusters of related antibody sequences in each mouse following FACS, suggesting evolution of clonal
lineages. In the pre-sort repertoires, these putative clonal lineages varied in both the complementary-
determining region (CDR)3K and CDR3H, while the FACS-selected PD-1-binding subsets varied primarily in
the CDR3H. PD-1 binders were generally not highly diverged from germline, showing 98% identity on
average with germline V-genes. Some CDR3 sequences were discovered in more than one animal, even
across different mouse strains, suggesting convergent evolution. We synthesized 17 of the anti-PD-1
binders as full-length monoclonal antibodies. All 17 full-length antibodies bound recombinant PD-1 with
KD < 500 nM (average D 62 nM). Fifteen of the 17 full-length antibodies specifically bound surface-
expressed PD-1 in a FACS assay, and nine of the antibodies functioned as checkpoint inhibitors in a
cellular assay. We conclude that our method is a viable alternative to hybridomas, with key advantages in
comprehensiveness and turnaround time.

Introduction
Most monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for cancer approved by
the US Food and Drug Administration were discovered
through mouse immunization followed by hybridoma screen-
ing.1 In this process, wild-type or humanized mice are immu-
nized with a clinically relevant antigen over the course of
several weeks, and then hybridomas are generated by fusing
primary B cells with myeloma cells.2 Mouse hybridoma genera-
tion is cheap and efficient, but the process of screening hybrid-
omas for antigen binders remains expensive, inefficient, and
time consuming. To increase hybridoma screening throughput,
large-scale discovery groups often invest in costly robotic work-
flows. We propose that the field would benefit from antibody
discovery methods that reduce costs and improve timelines.
Alternative methods for mouse antibody repertoire mining
are now available through recent advances in molecular geno-
mic technologies. Molecular genomics uses primer pools that
amplify rearranged V(D)J sequences to generate diverse librar-
ies that are subjected to next-generation sequencing techniques
that acquire millions of antibody sequences.3 This “deep”
sequencing approach provides a far more comprehensive repre-
sentation of mammalian antibody repertoires than hybridoma
screening because RNA from millions of B cells can be analyzed
in a single reaction. However, the difficulty of linking such an
enormous number of sequences to function is a substantial
detraction to most deep sequencing methods. For example,
using conventional methods to express hundreds of thousands
of antibody sequences as mAbs is currently cost prohibitive.
Prior work has described technologies that retain heavy and
light chain pairing by using well plate sorting4-6 or microfluidic
devices.7 The importance of such retained pairing for functional
antibody discovery has also been demonstrated by combining 96-
well plate sorting, yeast display, and deep sequencing for discovery
of mouse mAbs.8 We are aware of no published reports of a molec-
ular genomic method that retains native single B cell pairing of
heavy and light chains and enables affinity screening of mouse rep-
ertoires for rare antibodies. Here, we describe an emulsion droplet
microfluidics method to capture paired heavy and light chain
libraries from millions of single B cells (Fig. 1). The libraries are
then expressed as yeast scFv and screened for high-affinity binders.

 PD-1 is a cell surface receptor that suppresses T cell inflam-
matory activity, and is expressed by immune cells including T
cells, B cells, and macrophages. PD-L1, the primary ligand for
PD-1, is also expressed by these immune cells. The interaction
of PD-1 and PD-L1 is vitally important for establishing periph-
eral tolerance.9 Tumor cells hijack the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway by
up-regulating PD-L1 to suppress the anti-tumor immune
response. Recently, therapeutic checkpoint inhibitor mAbs
have been commercialized that antagonize PD-1/PD-L1 bind-
ing, thereby inhibiting tumor immune escape.10 In this study,
we leveraged our novel screening method to rapidly discover
an array of new anti-PD-1 antibodies from the repertoires of
six mice. We found that our method is an attractive alternative
to hybridoma-based antibody discovery.
Results
Overview of the experimental approach
First, we immunized five Balb/c and five SJL mice with soluble
PD-1 immunogen. All five SJL mice had a positive serum titer
against PD-1, whereas only one of the Balb/c mice had a posi-
tive serum titer (Fig. 2A, Fig. 3A). We made single cell suspen-
sions from lymph nodes surgically removed from the six
responsive animals, and B cells were isolated using a magnetic
bead kit. We ran approximately one million B cells from each
of the six animals through our emulsion droplet microfluidics
platform (Supplementary Table S1). The final product for each
sample was a DNA library encoding scFv from RNA of single
cells, with native heavy-light Ig pairing intact.
Figure 1. Overview of the workflow used to generate the scFv libraries from B cells isolated from Balb/c and SJL mice. B cells are isolated from lymph nodes and encapsu-
lated into droplets with oligo-dT beads and a lysis solution. mRNA-bound beads are purified from the droplets, and then injected into a second emulsion with an
OE-RT-PCR amplification mix that generates DNA amplicons that encode scFv with native pairing of heavy and light chain Ig. Libraries of natively paired amplicons are
then electroporated into yeast for scFv display. FACS is used to identify high affinity scFv. Finally, deep antibody sequencing is used to identify all clones in the pre- and
post-sort scFv libraries.

for c-Myc (AF488) is used to differentiate yeast cells that express scFv from yeast cells that do not express scFv (x-axis). Staining for biotinylated antigen (PE) is used to
identify yeast that express scFv binders. The Fc negative control (left) is used to set gates to capture yeast cells that express scFv and bind antigen (upper right corner of

 Next, the six DNA libraries were expressed as surface
scFv in yeast (Fig. 2B, Fig. 3B). The yeast display libraries
were stained with anti-c-Myc (to mark scFv-expressing
cells) and biotinylated PD-1 followed by phycoerythrin
(PE)-streptavidin, and then subjected to fluorescence-acti-
vated cell sorting (FACS). PD-1-binding clones were recov-
ered and subjected to deep repertoire sequencing. Deep
repertoire sequencing determines the sequences of all paired

 V(D)J regions of both heavy and light chain sequences. The
sorted yeast cells were expanded, and then another round
of staining, FACS, and deep sequencing was performed to
increase confidence in the scFv binders. Seventeen scFv
sequences that were present at low frequency in pre-sort
libraries and became high frequency in post-sort libraries
were then synthesized as full-length mAbs in Chinese ham-
ster ovary (CHO) cells. The full-length mAbs were validated
for binding kinetics through bio-layer interferometry (BLI)
and checkpoint inhibition through in vitro cellular assays.
Characterization of antibody repertoires
post-immunization
We define antibody “clones” as the consensus of closely related
groups of sequences with �2 amino acid differences in their
CDR3 sequences. The overall diversity of antibody clones in
the pre-sort scFv libraries ranged from 4,000–13,300 antibody
clones (Supplementary Table S1). The overall abundance distri-
butions of the antibody clones were similar between animals,
with several higher abundance clones followed by a long, low
abundance tail (Supplementary Figure S1). However, there was
variance in the level of the highest abundance clone sequences
among the mice, ranging from 1.8% of reads for SJL 565 to
8.9% of reads for SJL 568.
Divergence from germline V sequences is a common metric
to identify antigen-driven antibody evolution. To this end, we
compared the percent identities between the V region nucleo-
tide sequence for each antibody and its putative germline
nucleotide sequence for the 500 most abundant clones from
each pre-sort library. We found that the average divergence
was similar across the animals: 97.9% (range 95.7%–98.7%) for
Ig heavy chain and 97.8% (range 96.3%–98.4%) for Ig kappa
light chain.
Isolation of PD-1 binders by yeast display
In a typical FACS dot plot, the upper right quadrant contains
yeast that stain for both antigen binding and scFv expression
(identified by a C-terminal c-Myc tag). The lower left quadrant
contains yeast that do not stain for either the antigen or scFv
expression. The lower right quadrant contains yeast that
express the scFv but do not bind the antigen. We estimate the
frequency of binders in each repertoire by dividing the count of
yeast that double stain for antigen and scFv expression by the
count of yeast that express an scFv (Fig. 2B, Fig. 3B).
Libraries generated from immunized mice yielded low per-
centages of scFv binders (ranging from 0.08%–1.28%) when
sorted at 7 nM final antigen concentration. There was no clear
association between serum titer and the frequency of binders in
a repertoire. Following expansion of these sorted cells, a second
round of FACS at 7 nM final antigen concentration was used to
increase the specificity of the screen. The frequency of binders
in the second FACS was always substantially higher than the
first FACS, ranging from 8.39%–84.4%. Generally, lower fre-
quency of binders in the first sort yielded lower frequency of
binders in the second sort. Presumably, this is due to lower gat-
ing specificity for samples that have fewer bona fide binders in
the original repertoire.
We used deep repertoire sequencing to assess clonal diver-
sity of each population of binders post second FACS sort. Deep
repertoire sequencing determines the sequences of all paired V
(D)J regions of both heavy and light chain sequences. The pop-
ulation of PD-1 binders was oligoclonal, with the five most
common paired, variable region amino acid sequences com-
prising >60% of the sequence counts for each of the six mice.
Each animal yielded 38–50 unique scFv sequences present at
0.1% frequency or greater after the second FACS selection, for
a total of 269 unique scFv candidate binders (Supplementary
Tables S2-S3). These PD-1-binding scFvs were present at an
average frequency of 0.05% in the pre-sort libraries. Using a
cumulative binomial probability function, we computed that
we would have had to screen >100,000 hybridoma clones to
have a >90% probability of finding 40 anti-PD-1 binders that
were each present at 0.05% frequency in the pre-sort libraries.
In our method, the two rounds of FACS resulted in an average
enrichment of 800-fold for the PD-1-binding scFvs, and the
largest enrichment was nearly 29,000-fold (scFv Balb-3). In
addition, many scFv were not detected in the sequencing data
from the initial population of B cells from the immunized mice.
This indicates that our method can enrich for rare nM-affinity
binders from the initial population of B cells from immunized
mice.
Evolutionary characteristics of PD-1 binders
Next, we studied the evolutionary characteristics of the anti-
PD-1 antibody sequences. Consistent with a short immuniza-
tion protocol, PD-1 binders generally showed little nucleotide
divergence from germline sequences. For example, the average
IgKV identity to germline was 98.3%, and the average IgHV
identity to germline was 98.0% (Supplementary Tables S2-S3),
similar to the average identities of the pre-sort immunized
libraries (97.8% and 97.9%, respectively). Assessment of
Replacement (R) versus Silent (S) nucleotide mutations is
another metric that is often used to identify antigen-driven
affinity selection of antibody sequences.11 The R/S ratio was
computed by first determining V(D)J nucleotide variations
from germline sequence, excluding the FR4 and CDR3
domains. We then determined whether each mutation leads to
a different amino acid (R; replacement mutation) or the same
amino acid (S; silent mutation). R/S ratios that exceed 3 imply
directed somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation.12 We
determined the R and S values across the V region for the
FACS-selected antibody sequences. Consistent with minimal
divergence from germline, the average R/S ratio for all PD-1
binders was only 1.8 for Ig heavy chain and 1.5 for Ig light
chain. These data suggest that most of the antigen specificity of
individual binders was conferred through V(D)J recombination
rather than affinity maturation.
To further investigate clonal evolution, we looked for clus-
ters of similar antibody sequences among the PD-1 binders.
For this study, we defined a cluster as a group of scFv composed
of four or more distinct protein sequences that share IgKV,
IgKJ, IgHV, and IgHJ genes, and have the same length CDR3K
and CDR3H. We observed at least one cluster of similar scFv
sequences in each of the six animals. The dominant cluster (i.e.,
the cluster comprising the largest number of unique scFv
MABS
1273
 clones) for each animal consistently included the most abun-
dant scFv sequence from the FACS-selected cell population.
Next, we analyzed the amino acid locations that accounted
for antibody sequence divergence within each clonal cluster.
We aligned the full-length antibody sequences from the domi-
nant cluster of anti-PD-1 binders from each mouse (Fig. 4).
Sequence divergence was most common in the CDR3H,
accounting for 51 of 151 total variant amino acid positions
across the six exemplary post-sort clusters (note that variations
in the N-terminus of the clusters are likely the result of mis-
hybridization by 5’ V-gene primers during the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), and were thus excluded from analysis).
CDR3K was far more invariant than CDR3H in the post-sort
clonal clusters. In contrast, the six corresponding clonal clusters
generated from pre-sort libraries revealed variation across both
CDR3H and CDR3K regions (Fig. 4). These pre-sort clonal
clusters were generally dominated by the consensus amino acid
sequence, and all but one amino acid position showed varia-
tion. Though the CDR3K consensus sequences were identical
for each of the six pre- and post-sort clonal cluster pairs, varia-
tion across the individual CDR3K sequences was lower in the
post-sort clusters, with most positions filled only by the
Figure 4. Amino acid sequence logos for groups of evolutionarily related clones, i.e., putative clonal lineages. CDR3 amino acid sequences from the pre-sort libraries are
on the left. Full V(D)J amino acid sequences are shown on the right for post-sort libraries, and an expanded view of the CDR3 amino acid sequences is shown in the mid-
dle. Variant amino acids are emphasized with red arrows (the first seven amino acids are omitted due to the high probability of mis-priming during OE-RT-PCR). Though
2–3 such groups were present after each 2nd FACS, we display only a single representative dominant clonal expansion from each mouse: (A) Balb/c 559, (B) SJL 564, (C)
SJL 565, (D) SJL 566, (E) SJL 567, and (F) SJL 568.

 consensus amino acid. Post-sort CDR3H sequences also had
positions filled only by the consensus amino acid; however,
there was more amino acid heterogeneity at specific positions
than in the pre-sort clusters. We conclude that FACS selection
favored subsets of antibody sequences from the original clonal
clusters generated by the mice.
Though deep sequencing error rates are as high as 1%,13 we
took several steps to curate high-quality sequences, including
error filtering, merging variant sequences into “clones”, and
merging overlapping forward and reverse reads. If the variant
amino acids were mostly sequencing errors, mutations would
have been more randomly distributed across the sequences,
rather than clustered in CDR3H regions. Heavy chain sequen-
ces contained more variant amino acid positions than light
chain sequences (108 versus 43 variant positions, respectively).
Two of the clusters (from animals SJL 566 and SJL 567) also
had a sizable number of amino acid substitutions in the CDR1
and CDR2 regions of both heavy and light chain (Fig. 4).
We also made alignments of antibody sequences that appear
to be examples of convergent evolution across the two mouse
strains or from independent SJL mice. An alignment between
scFv Balb-2, Balb-3, and SJL-565-4 shows that SJL-565-4 shares
all but the IgKJ gene used in the Balb/c animals (Supplementary
Figure S2). However, the SJL 565 animal produced an antibody
with a CDR3K that is nearly identical to the CDR3K found in
the Balb/c animal. Another cross-strain alignment between
Balb-9 and SJL-565-2 revealed identical Ig heavy chain protein
sequences (with one silent nucleotide difference) and Ig light
chain protein sequences that differ by only one amino acid in a
framework region (Supplementary Figure S3). Antibodies SJL-
564-2 and SJL-566-3 from two different SJL mice are identical
across the entire IgKV gene with the same CDR3K sequences,
but were generated with different IgKJ genes (Supplementary
Figure S4). These antibodies share the same IgHV gene and
CDR3H protein sequence, but have diverged at four amino
acid positions, including changes in the CDR1 and CDR2
regions. Finally, antibodies SJL-566-1 and SJL-566-2, discov-
ered in the same mouse, are an example of members from the
same cluster, with some changes within and outside of the
CDR3 regions (Supplementary Figure S5).
Functional validation of select mAbs
Assessing the function of all 269 FACS-selected scFv candidates
was beyond the scope of this study. However, to validate the
utility of the FACS approach, we chose 17 scFvs to re-engineer
as purified, full-length mAbs for further validation. These
mAbs comprised the 2–3 most abundant sequences in the sec-
ond round of FACS for each animal. In addition, we selected
antibody
sequences
that
suggested
convergent
evolution
between the SJL and Balb/c mouse strains: SJL-565-4, which is
similar to Balb-2 and Balb-3; Balb-4, which shares an Ig light
chain sequence with several scFv binders from both Balb/c and
SJL mice; and Balb-9, which differs with SJL-565-2 Ig light
chain by only two amino acids and has an identical Ig heavy
chain protein sequence.
The binding specificity and affinity of each full-length anti-
body towards PD-1 was determined using BLI. We found that
all 17 antibodies bound to PD-1, with affinities (KD) ranging
from 0.25–430 nM (Tables 1–2; Supplementary Figure S6).
Additionally, one mAb (SJL-568-1) registered at KD < 1 pM
due to its inability to disassociate from PD-1. The SJL mice gen-
erally produced tighter binders, with an average KD of 20 nM,
versus an average KD of 165 nM for the Balb/c mouse. Addi-
tionally, we expressed PD-1 recombinantly on the surface of
CHO cells, and then used a FACS-based assay to detect mAb
binding. We found that 15 of 17 antibodies specifically bound
cells with surface-expressed PD-1, but they did not bind to cells
expressing the unrelated surface-expressed protein OX40
(Tables 1–2; Supplementary Figure S7).
Binding of PD-1 to PD-L1 leads to inhibition of T cell sig-
naling.9 Antibodies that bind PD-1 and antagonize PD-1/PD-
L1 interactions can therefore remove this inhibition, allowing
T cells to be activated. We tested PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint
blockade through an in vitro cellular Nuclear Factor of Acti-
vated T cells (NFAT) luciferase reporter assay. In this assay,
antibodies whose anti-PD-1 epitopes fall inside the PD-L1
binding domain antagonize PD-1/PD-L1 interactions, resulting
in an increase of the NFAT-luciferase reporter. We assayed the
17 full-length mAb candidates that bound PD-1 expressed in
CHO cells. To generate an IC50 value for each mAb, we made
measurements across several concentrations (Supplementary
Figure S8). We found that nine of 17 full-length mAbs were
functional in checkpoint blockade in a dose dependent manner
(Tables 1–2).
Finally, our examples of convergent evolution revealed that
minor sequence mutations can lead to changes in binding
kinetics and checkpoint blockade. For example, though Balb-2,
Balb-3, and SJL-565-4 have very similar CDR3 sequences,
variations throughout the heavy and light chain V regions led
to different KD values of 37 nM, 300 nM, and 8 nM, respec-
tively (Supplementary Figure S2). None of the three antibodies
functioned in checkpoint blockade. Balb-9 and SJL-565-2,
which only have a single amino acid difference, led to a modest
but consistent shift for both affinity (15 nM and 7.6 nM,
respectively) and checkpoint blockade IC50 (1.9 mg/ml and
0.65 mg/ml, respectively; Supplementary Figure S3). SJL-564-2
and SJL-566-3 have identical CDR3H amino acid sequences,

 but a different IgKJ gene and two amino acid differences in the
CDR1H and CDR2H regions. These differences were sufficient
to decrease affinity from 12 nM for SJL-564-2 to 65 nM for
SJL-566-3 (Supplementary Figure S4). Neither mAb functioned
in checkpoint blockade. Finally, the closely related mAbs SJL-
566-1 and SJL-566-2 from the same cluster had differences in
KD (7.2 nM and 25 nM, respectively) and checkpoint blockade
IC50 (1.43 mg/ml and 1.84 mg/ml, respectively; Supplementary
Figure S5).
Discussion
From only six animals, we identified 269 high-confidence,
unique scFv binders against human PD-1 immunogen that
were present at an average of 1 in 2,000 in the initial pre-sort
scFv libraries. Two rounds of FACS produced populations of
scFv with an average enrichment of 800-fold. However, most of
the scFv present in the pre-sort mouse repertoires were elimi-
nated following FACS. Therefore, our work suggests that most
of the antibodies present in the repertoires of immunized mice
are not strong binders to the immunogen. We expressed 17
scFv candidates as full-length mAbs. All 17 antibodies bound
recombinant PD-1 with KD < 500 nM, and one antibody was
KD < 1 pM. Fifteen of the 17 antibodies specifically bound sur-
face-expressed PD-1 in a cellular FACS assay, and nine of these
antibodies were functional in checkpoint blockade in a cell-
based assay. With further development, the functional mAbs
could be engineered into candidates for cancer therapy by
checkpoint blockade.
Other groups have successfully discovered high-affinity anti-
bodies in the repertoires of immunized mice using deep
sequencing, but without the benefit of microfluidic technology
for Ig pairing.3,6,14-16 Generally, these groups first used deep
sequencing followed by bioinformatics to identify the most
common antibodies in the animals. Then, they inferred Ig pair-
ings by matching frequent heavy chains with frequent light
chains. These methods generally yielded high-affinity binders,
achieving 0–40% false discovery rates. However, our method
has two distinct advantages over most previously published
deep sequencing methods: 1) we achieve native Ig pairing, and
2) our process is designed to discover rare antibodies. Though
accurate false negative rates are impossible to compute without
clear truth models, our method must have a lower false negative
rate than prior methods, since prior methods explicitly exclude
rare antibodies and do not necessarily include natively paired
antibodies.
Further improvements to our protocols can be made. For
example, many scFv that are <0.1% frequency in FACS-
selected populations may also be high affinity binders. Future
studies should more precisely determine the appropriate post-
FACS frequency cut-off for identifying antibodies of the desired
binding affinity. In this study, we did not try different antigen
molarities for optimal FACS selection. Future work might opti-
mize the balance between lower antigen molarities, which
might yield more KD < 1 nM scFv binders, and higher antigen
molarities, which might yield a greater variety of scFv sequen-
ces. Prior work suggests scFv can bind with lower affinity than
full length mAbs.17-19 To address this issue, our approach could
be modified to leverage a variety of display methods, for
example yeast antigen-binding fragment display.20,21 Addition-
ally, we note that it is possible to perform yeast scFv display
with DNA libraries generated using randomly paired Ig
sequences.22 This may generate a larger diversity of scFv bind-
ers because a given heavy or light chain may still bind antigen
if paired with a non-cognate light or heavy chain, respec-
tively.23,24 Such non-native pairings may result in additional
antibodies with favorable properties, augmenting intellectual
property portfolios. However, we speculate that non-natively
paired antibodies may not be as developable as natively-paired
antibodies. Finally, future work might explore methods that
first enrich B cells using the desired antigen25-29 prior to micro-
fluidic droplet encapsulation. Pre-enrichment might yield yeast
scFv libraries with a higher proportion of binders, thereby
increasing the probability of discovering rare antibodies. On
the other hand, pre-enrichment might exclude useful popula-
tions of scFv binders, for example because different enrichment
protocols are required for enrichment of memory B cells as
opposed to plasma cells.29
FACS selection yielded clusters of similar scFv sequences,
which suggests early stages of clonal divergence. Other groups
have observed a similar phenomenon in the repertoires of
immunized mice.6,15,16,30 We acknowledge that the high error
rate of deep sequencing could produce erroneous sequences
that masquerade as clonal divergence, a problem that has been
addressed elsewhere with alternative molecular methods.31,32
Still, to reduce the probability of errors, we filtered out low-
quality reads, required multiple identical sequencing reads, and
merged overlapping forward and reverse reads to generate
high-confidence consensus antibody sequences. In addition,
sequencing errors would be spread out across the entire heavy
and light chain regions. However, our data show that most of
the sequence differences between antibody clusters reside
within the CDR3 regions, suggesting true clonal divergence.
Similar to our study, prior work also detected antibody
sequence convergence between mouse replicates.3,16 Though
some apparent convergence may result from workflow contam-
ination,3 future work should investigate whether convergence
helps to detect high-affinity antibodies.16 We are confident that
some convergence does occur, since we identified large clonally
related antibodies in multiple animals, rather than just a few
shared reads.
Prior work on mouse plasma cell repertoires found only 2–5
amino acid substitutions per V-gene,3 roughly in line with our
data on lymph node B cells and other published work on sple-
nocytes.14,30 In the future, we hope to improve our mouse
immunization protocol to increase divergence from germline
and affinity maturation in vivo. One approach will focus on
bone marrow plasma cells, which are <1% of all lymphoid cells
but generate most antibodies in circulation. Bone marrow
plasma cells may yield more evolved and higher-affinity anti-
bodies than B cells from the lymph node or spleen.33 Another
approach will focus on mouse immunization procedures that
allow for improved in vivo affinity maturation, with the goal of
finding a large variety of high-affinity antibodies from cohorts
of <10 mice.
In this study, we performed a limited set of biochemical and
cellular assays to validate the mAbs identified using our
discovery methodology. We acknowledge that more exhaustive
MABS
1277
 pre-clinical studies would be required to develop any of these
candidate mAbs as therapeutics. For example, the mAbs should
be humanized34 and subjected to in vitro affinity maturation.35
Our data on clonal lineages might simplify such antibody
engineering development work, for example, by identifying
highly constrained amino acid residues. Additionally, further
development would require comprehensive epitope mapping36
or epitope binning37 on hundreds of our mAb candidates. Anti-
body development would also require larger-scale studies of
specificity, for example with peptide arrays.38 Such studies
would also help elucidate whether our microfluidic and molec-
ular genomic protocols bias antibody discovery toward certain
epitopes, or identify antibodies with lower specificity than alter-
native discovery methods.
The complete process of scFv binder discovery, not includ-
ing mouse immunizations, required only three weeks and the
work of a single technician. The process of scFv re-engineering
and mAb expression is widely practiced and requires less than
three weeks of additional effort, even without automation. To
increase the throughput of scFv re-engineering, exploratory
work has shown that engineering millions-diverse full-length
mammalian libraries from OE-RT-PCR scFv amplicons is pos-
sible.39 In the future, full-length mammalian libraries could be
used for massively parallel functional screens, for example, to
directly discover rare neutralizing antibodies from diverse rep-
ertoires. In general, the speed and convenience of our methods
result in a larger number of candidates for development pipe-
lines. More mice can be screened and each mouse can be
screened more exhaustively. This has substantial advantages for
intellectual property because a program can choose a target
and quickly identify hundreds of unique, validated binders. In
theory, technologies such as ours could also lead to shorter
commercialization timelines.
Materials and methods
Mouse immunization and sample preparation
All mouse work was performed at Aragen Bioscience, a con-
tract research organization, and was overseen by a licensed vet-
erinarian. Five SJL mice and five Balb/c mice were immunized
with recombinant His-tagged PD-1 protein (R&D Systems),
using TiterMax as an adjuvant. One mg of immunogen was
injected into each hock and 3 mg of immunogen was adminis-
tered intraperitoneally, every third day for 15 days. Titer was
assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on a
1:2 dilution series of each animal’s serum, starting at a 1:200
dilution. A final intravenous boost of 2.5 mg/hock without
adjuvant was given to each animal before harvest. Lymph nodes
(popliteal, inguinal, axillary, and mesenteric) were surgically
removed after sacrifice. Single cell suspensions for each animal
were made by manual disruption followed by passage through
a 70 mm filter. Next, we used the EasySepTM Mouse Pan-B Cell
Isolation Kit (Stemcell Technologies) negative selection kit to
isolate B cells from each sample. The lymph node B cell popula-
tions were quantified by counting on a C-Chip hemocytometer
(Incyto) and assessed for viability using Trypan blue. The cells
were then diluted to 5,000–6,000 cells/mL in phosphate-buff-
ered saline (PBS) with 12% OptiPrepTM Density Gradient
Medium (Sigma). This cell mixture was used for microfluidic
encapslation as described in the next section
Generating paired heavy and light chain libraries
Library generation is divided into three steps: 1) poly(A)C
mRNA capture, 2) multiplexed overlap extension reverse tran-
scriptase polymerase chain reaction (OE-RT-PCR), and 3)
nested PCR to remove artifacts and add adapters for deep
sequencing or yeast display libraries. We created scFv libraries
from approximately one million B cells from each animal that
achieved a positive ELISA titer.
For poly(A)C mRNA capture, we used a custom designed
co-flow emulsion droplet microfluidic chip fabricated from
glass (Dolomite). The microfluidic chip has two input channels
for fluorocarbon oil (Dolomite), one input channel for the cell
suspension mix described above, and one input channel for
oligo-dT beads (NEB) at 1.25 mg/ml in cell lysis buffer (20 mM
Tris pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), 0.5% Tween-20, and 20 mM dithiothreitol). The
input channels are etched to 50 mm £ 150 mm for most of
the chip’s length, narrow to 55 mm at the droplet junction, and
are coated with hydrophobic Pico-Glide (Dolomite). Three
Mitos P-Pump pressure pumps (Dolomite) were used to pump
the liquids through the chip. Droplet size depends on pressure,
but typically we find that droplets of »45 mm diameter are
optimally stable. Emulsions are collected into chilled 2 ml
microcentrifuge tubes and incubated at 40 �C for 15 minutes
for mRNA capture. The beads were extracted from the droplets
using Pico-Break (Dolomite).
For multiplex OE-RT-PCR, we used glass Telos droplet
emulsion
microfluidic
chips
(Dolomite).
mRNA-bound
beads were re-suspended into OE-RT-PCR mix and injected
into the microfluidic chips with a mineral oil-based surfac-
tant mix (available commercially from GigaGen) at pres-
sures that generate 27 mm droplets. The OE-RT-PCR mix
contains 2 £ one-step RT-PCR buffer, 2.0 mM MgSO4,
SuperScript III reverse transcriptase, and Platinum Taq
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), plus a mixture of primers
directed against the IgK C region, the IgG C region, and all
V regions (Supplementary Figure S9).22 The overlap region
is a DNA sequence that encodes a Gly-Ser rich scFv linker
sequence.40 The DNA fragments are recovered from the
droplets using a droplet breaking solution (available com-
mercially from GigaGen) and then purified using QIAquick
PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen).
For nested PCR (Supplementary Figure S9), the purified
OE-RT-PCR product was first run on a 1.7% agarose gel for 80
minutes at 150 V. A band at 1200–1500 base pair (bp) corre-
sponding to the linked product was excised and purified using
NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up Kit (Macherey Nagel). PCR
was then performed to add adapters for Illumina sequencing or
yeast display; for sequencing, a randomer of seven nucleotides
is added to increase base calling accuracy in subsequent next-
generation sequencing steps. Nested PCR was performed with
2 £ NEBNext High-Fidelity amplification mix (NEB) with
either Illumina adapter containing primers or primers for clon-
ing into the yeast expression vector. The nested PCR product
was run on a 1.2% agarose gel for 50 minutes at 150V. A band
1278

 at 800–1100 bp was excised and purified using NucleoSpin Gel
and PCR Clean-up Kit (Macherey Nagel).
Yeast library screening
Human IgG1-Fc (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and PD-1 (R&D
Systems) proteins were biotinylated using the EZ-Link Micro
Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotinylation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The biotinylation reagent was resuspended to 9 mM and added
to the protein at a 50-fold molar excess. The reaction was incu-
bated on ice for 2 hours and then the biotinylation reagent was
removed using Zeba desalting columns (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific). The final protein concentration was calculated with a
Bradford assay.
We built a yeast surface display vector (pYD) that contains a
GAL1/10 promoter, an Aga2 cell wall tether, and a C-terminal
c-Myc tag (Supplementary Figure S10). The GAL1/10 promoter
induces expression of the scFv protein in medium that contains
galactose. The Aga2 cell wall tether is required to shuttle the
scFv to the yeast cell surface and tether the scFv to the extracel-
lular space. The c-Myc tag is used during the flow sort to stain
for yeast cells that express in-frame scFv protein. Saccharomyces
cerevisiae cells (ATCC) are electroporated (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser
II; 0.54 kV, 25 uF, resistance set to infinity) with gel-purified
nested PCR product and linearized pYD vector for homologous
recombination in vivo. Transformed cells are expanded and
induced with galactose to generate yeast scFv display libraries.
Two million yeast cells from the expanded scFv libraries are
stained with anti-c-Myc (Thermo Fisher Scientific A21281) and
an AF488-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific A11039). To select scFv-expressing cells that bind to anti-
gen, biotinylated antigen is added to the yeast culture (7 nM
final) during primary antibody incubation and then stained with
PE-streptavidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Yeast cells are flow
sorted on a BD Influx (Stanford Shared FACS Facility) for dou-
ble-positive cells (AF488C/PEC), and recovered clones are then
plated on SD-CAA plates with kanamycin, streptomycin, and
penicillin (Teknova) for expansion. The expanded first round
FACS clones are then subjected to a second round of FACS with
the same antigen at the same molarity (7 nM final). Plasmid
minipreps (Zymo Research) are prepared from yeast recovered
from the final FACS sort. Tailed-end PCR is used to add Illu-
mina adapters to the plasmid libraries for deep sequencing.
Deep antibody repertoire sequencing
Deep antibody sequencing libraries were quantified using a
quantitative PCR Illumina Library Quantification Kit (KAPA)
and diluted to 17.5 pM. Libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq
(Illumina) using a 500 cycle MiSeq Reagent Kit v2, according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. To obtain high quality
sequence reads with maintained heavy and light chain linkage,
we performed sequencing in two separate runs (Supplementary
Figure S11). In the first run (“linked run”), we directly
sequenced the scFv libraries to obtain forward read of 340
cycles for the light chain V-gene and CDR3, and reverse read
of 162 cycles that cover the heavy chain CDR3 and part of the
heavy chain V-gene. In the second run (“unlinked run”), we
first used the scFv library as a template for PCR to separately
amplify heavy and light chain V-genes. Then, we obtained for-
ward reads of 340 cycles and reverse reads of 162 cycles for the
heavy and light chain Ig separately. This produces forward and
reverse reads that overlap at the CDR3 and part of the V-gene,
which increases confidence in nucleotide calls.
To remove base call errors, we used a previously published
expected error filtering method.13 The expected number of
errors (E) for a read were calculated from its Phred scores. By
default, reads with E >1 were discarded, leaving reads for
which the most probable number of base call errors is zero. As
an additional quality filter, singleton nucleotide reads were dis-
carded because sequences found two or more times have a high
probability of being correct.41 Finally, we generated high-qual-
ity, linked antibody sequences by merging filtered sequences
from the linked and unlinked runs. Briefly, we wrote a series of
scripts in Python that first merged forward and reverse reads
from the unlinked run. We discarded any pairs of forward and
reverse sequences that contain mismatches. Next, we used the
nucleotide sequences from the linked run to query merged
sequences in the unlinked run. The final output from the scripts
is a series of full-length, high-quality V(D)J sequences, with
native heavy and light chain Ig pairing.
To identify reading frame and FR/CDR junctions, we first
processed a database of well-curated immunoglobulin sequen-
ces42 to generate position-specific sequence matrices (PSSMs)
for each FR/CDR junction (Supplementary Figure S12). We
used these PSSMs to identify FR/CDR junctions for each of the
merged nucleotide sequences generated using the processes
described above. This identified the protein reading frame for
each of the nucleotide sequences. CDR sequences that have a
low identify score to the PSSMs are indicated by an exclama-
tion point. Python scripts were then used to translate the
sequences. We required reads to have a valid predicted CDR3
sequence, so, for example, reads with a frame-shift between the
V and J segments were discarded. Next, we ran UBLAST43
using the scFv nucleotide sequences as queries and V and J
gene sequences from the IMGT database42 as the reference
sequences. The UBLAST alignment with the lowest E-value
was used to assign V and J gene families and compute %ID to
germline. R/S values were computed using V gene segments
spanning the first amino acid through the FR3-CDR3 bound-
ary. CDR3s were not used in R/S value computation.
To estimate the diversity of the libraries, we defined
“clones” conservatively (Supplementary Table S1). First, we
concatenated the CDR3K and CDR3H amino acid sequences
from each scFv sequence into a single contiguous amino acid
sequence. Next, we used UBLAST43 to compute the total num-
ber of amino acid differences in all pairwise alignments
between each concatenated sequence in each data set. Groups
of
sequences
with
�2
amino
acid
differences
in
the
concatenated CDR3s were counted as a single clone. Finally, we
used the majority amino acid identity at each residue position
to generate the consensus amino acid sequence of the clone
from sequences of the members of the group.
Monoclonal antibody expression
The mAbs were expressed from a variant of the pCDNA5/FRT
mammalian expression vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The
MABS
1279
 vector uses an EF1-alpha promoter to drive light chain expres-
sion, followed by a BGH polyA sequence and a CMV promoter
to drive expression of the heavy chain, followed by a second
BGH polyA sequence (Supplementary Figure S13). Antibody
expression constructs were built using GeneBlocks (Integrated
DNA Technologies) and NEBuilder� HiFi DNA Assembly
Master Mix (New England BioLabs). All constructs were
synthesized as human IgG1, regardless of a given antibody’s
IgG isotype in the original mouse repertoire. Constructs were
amplified in NEB 10-beta E. coli and purified with the
ZymoPURETM Plasmid Maxiprep Kit (Zymo Research). The
purified plasmids were used for transient transfection in
the ExpiCHO system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Transfected
cells were cultured for 7–9 days in ExpiCHO medium and
antibodies were purified from filtered supernatant using protein
A columns (Millipore). Antibody purity and size was verified
by
Coomassie
stained
SDS-PAGE
gels
(Thermo
Fisher
Scientific).
Monoclonal antibody characterization
For measurement of PD-1 binding kinetics, antibodies were
loaded onto an Anti-Human IgG Fc (AHC) biosensor using
the Octet Red96 system (ForteBio), by a contract research orga-
nization (LakePharma). Loaded biosensors were dipped into
antigen dilutions beginning at 300 nM, with 6 serial dilutions
at 1:3. Kinetic analysis was performed using a 1:1 binding
model and global fitting (Supplementary Figure S6). Pembroli-
zumab produced in-house was used as a positive control.
Stable OX40 and PD-1 expressing Flp-In CHO (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) cells were generated and mixed at a 50:50
ratio. One million cells were stained with 2 mg of our purified
anti-PD-1 recombinant antibodies in 100 ml of MACS Buffer
(DPBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 2 mM EDTA) for
30 minutes at 4 �C. Cells were then co-stained with anti-human
CD134 (OX40)-APC [Ber-ACT35] (BioLegend 350008) and
anti-human IgG Fc-PE [M1310G05] (BioLegend 41070) anti-
bodies for 30 minutes at 4�C. An anti-human CD279 (PD-1)-
FITC [EH12.2H7] (BioLegend 329903) antibody was used as a
control for these mixing experiments and cell viability was
assessed with DAPI. Flow cytometry analysis was conducted on
a BD Influx at the Stanford Shared FACS Facility and data was
analyzed using FlowJo (Supplementary Figure S7).
For analysis of the antibodies’ ability to block the PD-1/PD-
L1 interaction, the PD-1/PD-L1 Blockade Bioassay (Promega)
was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. On the
day prior to the assay, PD-L1 aAPC/CHO-K1 cells were thawed
into 90% Ham’s F-12/10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and plated
into the inner 60 wells of two 96-well plates. The cells were
incubated overnight at 37 �C, 5% CO2. On the day of assay,
antibodies were diluted in 99% RPMI/1% FBS. The antibody
dilutions were added to the wells containing the PD-L1 aAPC/
CHO-K1 cells, followed by addition of PD-1 effector cells
(thawed into 99% RPMI/1% FBS). The cell/antibody mixtures
were incubated at 37 �C, 5% CO2 for 6 hours, after which Bio-
Glo Reagent was added and luminescence was read using a
Spectramax i3x plate reader (Molecular Devices). Fold-induc-
tion was plotted by calculating the ratio of [signal with anti-
body]/[signal with no antibody], and the plots were used to
calculate the IC50 using SoftMax Pro (Molecular Devices)
(Supplementary Figure S8). In-house produced pembrolizumab
was used as a positive control, and an antibody binding to an
irrelevant antigen was used as a negative control.
