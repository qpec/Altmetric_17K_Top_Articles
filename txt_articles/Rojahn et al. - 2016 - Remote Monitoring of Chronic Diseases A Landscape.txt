Abstract
Background
Remote monitoring (RM) is defined as the surveillance of device-transmitted outpatient
data. RM is expected to enable better management of chronic diseases. The objective of
this research was to identify public policies concerning RM in four European countries.
Methods
Searches of the medical literature, the Internet, and Ministry of Health websites for the
United Kingdom (UK), Germany, Italy, and Spain were performed in order to identify RM pol-
icies for chronic diseases, including end stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic pulmonary
obstructive disease (COPD), diabetes, heart failure, and hypertension. Searches were first
performed in Q1 2014 and updated in Q4 2015. In addition, in depth interviews were con-
ducted with payers/policymakers in each country. Information was obtained on existing poli-
cies, disease areas and RM services covered and level of reimbursement, other incentives
such as quality indicators, past/current assessments of RM technologies, diseases per-
ceived to benefit most from RM, and concerns about RM.
Results
Policies on RM and/or telemedicine were identified in all four countries. Pilot projects (mostly
in diabetes, COPD, and/or heart failure) existed or were planned in most countries. Perceived
value of RM was moderate to high, with the highest rating given for heart failure. Interviewees
expressed concerns about sharing of medical information, and the need for capital invest-
ment. Patients recently discharged from hospital, and patients living remotely, or with serious
and/or complicated diseases, were believed to be the most likely to benefit from RM. Formal
reimbursement is scarce, but more commonly available for patients with heart failure.
Conclusions
In the four European countries surveyed, RM has attracted considerable interest for its
potential to increase the efficiency of healthcare for chronic diseases. Although rare at this

Introduction
The terms “telemedicine” and “telehealth” are used to describe the exchange of medical infor-
mation electronically between one site and another with the aim of improving the health of
patients.[1] There is no universal definition for these terms, and they are sometimes used inter-
changeably.[1, 2] These terms cover a wide range of electronic health (eHealth) services and
technologies, including remote monitoring (RM) of a patient’s clinical status, teleconsultations,
tele-education, tele-diagnostics and tele-laboratory, and may involve videoconferencing and/or
transmission of still images.[2] RM is a technology that enables monitoring of patients beyond
conventional clinical settings, for example, in the home. A device or software is used to collect
a patient’s clinical data, such as blood pressure, blood glucose concentration, temperature, or
body weight, and the data are then transmitted to a hospital, physician’s office, clinic, telemedi-
cine vendor, or other party, for monitoring and analysis. On the basis of the RM data received,
an appropriate healthcare professional may decide to initiate a preventative therapeutic inter-
vention or change the patient’s prescription.
Incorporating RM into chronic disease management programmes can significantly improve
an individual’s quality of life, allowing patients to maintain independence, prevent complica-
tions, and minimise costs.[3–5] This is particularly important when patients are managing self-
care processes such as home dialysis.[6, 7] By RM and trend analysis of physiological parame-
ters, the technology enables early detection of deterioration of non-compliance and a patient’s
clinical condition. There is increasing evidence that RM data can help physicians and nurses to
proactively manage a patient’s treatment. RM has demonstrated some clinical benefit for
patients with chronic disease, including reduced all-cause or disease-specific hospitalisations
and emergency visits for patients with diabetes, end stage renal disease (ESRD), heart failure,
chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD), and hypertension.[8–12] RM has also been
associated with reduction in mortality in patients with heart failure, COPD, and diabetes.[10,
11, 13, 14] However, the effectiveness of RM, and other telemedicine services, may vary widely
according to different factors related to the patient, their health condition, the endpoints mea-
sured, the quality of the data collection, and the healthcare system in which the intervention is
being used. For example, a recent systematic review of the effectiveness, costs, and acceptability
of telemedicine found that the effect on all-cause hospital admissions (at median eight months
follow-up) ranged from a decrease of 64% to an increase of 60%, across the 11 heart failure
studies that were included.[3] On the other hand, a recent meta-analysis showed that patients
on RM had a 29% lower rate of heart failure-related hospitalisations (RR = 0.71; 95%CI: 0.60–
0.83) and a 20% lower rate of all-cause mortality (RR = 0.80; 95%CI: 0.68–0.94).[8]
Although, currently, there is only limited evidence of clinical benefit in patients with ESRD,
it is believed that RM might enable better management of patients receiving haemodialysis or
peritoneal dialysis in a home setting.[6, 7, 14] Thus, RM has the potential to increase access to
care and decrease healthcare delivery costs.[14] However, RM is highly dependent on patients’
ability to use the technologies involved, with additional barriers, such as cost, preventing its
widespread use.[2, 15] There is currently little evidence that RM represents an efficient use of
healthcare resources. Hence, healthcare systems have not yet put in place reimbursement
guidelines or proper funding for RM services. This may deter their adoption into clinical prac-
tice, as healthcare providers would have to assume the costs.[2, 16]

Healthcare also provided support in the form of
salaries for authors KR, SL, JS, CM, AI, JW, and NS,
but did not have a role in the study conduct, data
collection, analysis or reporting. The funder was,
however, involved in selecting vendor to conduct
study, study design, decision to publish and
preparation of the manuscript. The specific roles of
these authors are articulated in the 'author
contributions' section.
Competing Interests: The company selected by
Baxter to conduct the study was Double Helix. Baxter
Healthcare provided honoraria to TA and KIJ, as
employees of Double Helix. TA and KIJ were involved
in study conduct, data collection, analysis, and
reporting as articulated in the 'author contributions'
section. Baxter Healthcare has no ownership or legal
relationship with Double Helix other than the contract
for this study. The respective commercial affiliations
of the authors does not alter the authors' adherence
to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials,
with the exception of the primary research data as
described in Data Availability section.
 The objective of this study was, therefore, to understand the current policies for the support
and reimbursement of RM for home-based therapies, particularly for chronic disease states, in
four European countries: UK, Germany, Italy, and Spain.
Materials and Methods
Research objectives
Specific objectives of the research included: 1) to understand the current public policies for RM
in UK, Germany, Italy, and Spain; 2) to identify which countries are investing in RM pro-
grammes and have centres of excellence that use RM devices; 3) to identify which countries
have implemented incentives and policies to support RM for home-based therapies; and 4) to
identify and understand the barriers and, in particular, the perceived evidence gap in those that
have not yet implemented such incentives and policies.
Research methods
Two approaches were used to answer the research question: desk research involving medical
literature and internet searches, and primary research involving one-hour in depth interviews
with payers, policymakers, and clinicians.
To identify RM policies for chronic diseases, electronic searches of the published medical lit-
erature were conducted on MEDLINE, Embase1, Embase1 Alert, and the Cochrane Library,
and wider Internet searches were also performed, using the Google search engine. Search terms
for both the medical literature and internet searches included ‘telemedicine’ and related terms,
as well as ‘policy’. Citations were selected for full review if they met specific inclusion criteria
(e.g. specific country, policy, guidelines). Selected citations were reviewed and the following
information was extracted: type of services covered, reimbursement level, incentives (e.g. qual-
ity indicators), past or ongoing assessments of RM technologies, disease areas perceived to ben-
efit the most from RM, and concerns about RM use or implementation.
Several different methods of searching the Internet were employed to identify documents
relating to telemedicine/RM: structured searching of public electronic databases; targeted key
word and key phrase searching of previously identified key websites and standard internet
search engines e.g. Google; following links from key websites to other websites of interest, or to
locate relevant documents. In order to obtain an appropriate level of coverage, searches were
conducted from more than one perspective, e.g. following threads relating to the type of docu-
ment, the specific therapy area, intervention and management. All searches were originally per-
formed in February 2014 and updated in October 2015.
Additional primary research was conducted through one-hour in depth interviews with a
sample of three national policy makers/payers (1 from the UK, 1 from Germany, 1 from
Spain), ten regional payers (3 from the UK, 3 from Germany, 1 from Italy, 3 from Spain), and
six clinical experts with experience in developing RM initiatives (1 from the UK, 1 from Ger-
many, 3 from Italy, 1 from Spain). Four experienced native interviewers were involved, one for
each country.
The interviews were conducted in accordance with the ethical and legal guidelines produced
by the European Pharmaceutical Market Research Association (EphMRA) in order to protect
the rights of the consenting respondents, maintain confidentiality and anonymity, and avoid
promotion. Interviewee questions were divided up into four sections: Section 1 requested infor-
mation on the interviewee’s basic professional background, and their relevant experience with
the reimbursement of medical devices; Section 2 focused on country/region specific questions
on RM reimbursement, including funding, evidence requirements, and who influenced the
adoption of policies; Section 3 asked about the current and future RM reimbursement

 landscape, such as the information that is required to drive reimbursement adoption, the dis-
eases RM is most suitable for, and the type of clinical or health economics evidence necessary
to obtain reimbursement. Finally, Section 4 questioned the interviewees on RM reimbursement
models and incentives for physicians and providers, and the key drivers and barriers to RM
adoption (a sample interview discussion guide is provided in the online Supporting
Information).
To minimize risk of bias, the interviewer remained neutral in tone and language, and the
questions asked were simple and clear, to reduce risk of misunderstanding. The questions were
neutral in approach (leading questions were avoided), and all interviewees were asked the same
questions. The breadth of roles and countries from which the interviewees were recruited also
helped to reduce bias.
Transcripts of the interviews were produced, and these were then coded and analysed by
country for recurrent themes and ideas that were echoed by all professionals. Similarly, any
items that were distinctly highlighted as being different to the general consensus were noted.
This analysis was then performed by a second reviewer, to assess inter-rater reliability.
Results
Policies and initiatives on RM and/or telemedicine: findings from the
desk research)
Overall, there was a lack of alignment on definitions, research activities, and regional or
national adoption of RM. Policies and initiatives on RM specifically and/or telemedicine in
general were identified in all countries studied (Table 1) and most had regional or national
pilot projects underway (these were mainly in diabetes, heart failure, or COPD).
The UK government has invested heavily in experimental RM activity for chronic heart fail-
ure, diabetes, and COPD. The Whole Systems Demonstrator Project (WSD) was the largest
randomised controlled trial of RM conducted to date, and broadly aimed to evaluate the effec-
tiveness and cost-effectiveness of telemedicine in people with chronic health conditions and
social care needs.[17] The UK Department of Health report of ‘Headline Findings’ from the
WSD study (2011) showed substantial reductions in mortality and healthcare resource utilisa-
tion,[18] but the study had mixed objectives, RM technologies, patient populations, and disease
states, and subsequent reports have revealed results that are contradictory and ambiguous.
Although RM is perceived to be suitable for patients with any chronic disease, it is unclear
when it will be fully embraced by general practitioners (GPs) or specialists due to the lack of
robust evidence of cost-effectiveness. The UK National Health Service (NHS) is actively look-
ing for different ways of delivering care, and telemedicine/RM is a nationally recognised prior-
ity, but no national reimbursement mechanism currently exists.
In Germany, telemedicine (the broader category, which covers RM) has attracted strong
interest from the national government. This has led to funding being made available for large-
scale randomised clinical trials to drive telemedicine projects and better understand the bene-
fits. Germany has one of the most technologically advanced healthcare infrastructures in
Europe, having launched the e-health card (eGK) nationwide and developed a telematics infra-
structure. However, hurdles in implementation have also hindered RM technologies due to
software integration issues between physician’s offices and providers.
A number of telemedicine pilot studies have been initiated in Bayern, Nürnberg and Sach-
sen-Anhalt. The EBM (Einheitlicher Bewertungsmaßstab) is a reference list that regulates the
compensation system of outpatient care in Germany, and no EBM codes currently exist for
RM, but a ‘criteria catalogue’ has been established to provide guidance on what is required
from telemedicine studies.

 Following an initiative of the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians
(KBV), from April 2016, a cardiac pacemaker check-up will be the first telemedicine procedure
to be included in the EBM.[19] The KBV plans to introduce more remote procedures in the
future in order to solve the problem of overfilled practices.
In Italy, RM pilot projects are implemented at a regional level by the regional health author-
ities (Azienda Sanitaria Locale [ASL]). ‘Mydoctor@home’ is a RM/telemedicine pilot in Pied-
mont that demonstrated positive outcomes and was approved for roll-out.[20]
As in the UK, there is no standardised national tariff for telemedicine in Italy, which is seen
as a major barrier to adoption. However, the recently introduced Telemedicine National
Guidelines (approved February 2014) aim to standardise the approach to telemedicine and
propose a standardised tariff, which could lead to greater adoption of RM projects by ASLs.
In Spain, the recent economic downturn and financial constraints have resulted in a reluc-
tance to fund the capital investment of RM initiatives. The majority of funding for RM projects
is provided by international organisations (e.g., European Commission) or regional budgets.
RM efforts have not been widely adopted at the national level; however, there are some region-
ally-driven RM initiatives. One such initiative is the Research Unit for Telemedicine and Infor-
mation Society [UITeS] within the Institute of Carlos III, which develops standards alongside
the initiatives of the Ministry of Health and Social Policy, and encourages uptake of RM/tele-
medicine. Autonomous Communities (ACs) of Basque Country, Andalucía, Catalonia, Valen-
cia, Canarias, Madrid, and Navarra are seen as leaders in RM implementation in Spain due to
their investment in healthcare technology. ACs can choose individually to fund RM initiatives
and projects.
Perceived value and potential benefit of RM: findings from the primary
research)
Experience of the application of RM in the community home setting is primarily limited to a
few pilot studies in heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, and COPD. Amongst payers and pol-
icy makers in all of the countries surveyed, the value of RM was perceived to be moderate to
high across all these chronic disease states, and also ESRD (Fig 1). Chronic heart failure (CHF)
received the highest average rating (4.2±0.4 from a maximum of 5) whilst ESRD received the
lowest (3.4±0.8 from a maximum of 5). In all countries studied, respondents indicated that
CHF is a high priority area and that RM has high potential in this disease state.
This is consistent with the evidence in the literature of the benefits of RM for heart failure,
and may be due to the high prevalence of heart failure in the population as well as its health
economic burden. ESRD was not seen as a high priority for the application of RM, despite
acknowledgments that it is associated with low quality of life for patients and high costs. There
may also be a lack of awareness that approximately 30% of ESRD patients who initiate dialysis
also have heart failure.[35] Accordingly, where respondents were unaware of RM projects in
ESRD, its perceived potential was lower, and there was more awareness of the complexity of
managing heart failure, hypertension, diabetes and COPD.
In the UK, chronic diseases in general were considered to be well suited for RM application.
Hypertension scored highly, as there was a feeling from payers that this was a cardiovascular
risk factor that could be managed better in the NHS. A regional payer also indicated that
improved diabetes care was an area of interest that is growing, with particular emphasis on RM
use in younger, type 1 diabetic patients. In addition, payers felt that RM applications in home
dialysis could work for a cohort of stable patients. It was commented that ESRD is associated
with high cost and low quality of life, and that treating patients in their own home could pro-
vide a better service.

 In Germany, primary research findings indicated that all chronic conditions were suitable
for RM. Heart failure was considered to have the highest potential due to the greatest clinical
benefits RM could offer patients, and ESRD was rated as having lower potential. This could be
due to payers being unaware of RM projects for ESRD patients. Diabetes and hypertension
were considered to have the lowest RM potential because the evidence base for cost savings was
poor and careful selection of eligible patients would be necessary. It was commented that it
would not make sense to provide RM for a patient with diabetes whose treatment goals are
always met perfectly, but rather to provide it for some 10% of patients who regularly miss their
goals.
In Italy, heart failure was seen as having highest potential for RM projects, as it is a priority
for ASLs and also attracts government interest. Hypertension and COPD were also thought to
have high potential for RM, closely followed by diabetes. Overall, respondents in Italy gave
ESRD the lowest rating for RM potential, as home dialysis is not so common in Italy, with
89.6% of dialysis taking place in an outpatient dialysis unit and only 10.4% in the home.[36]
However, one payer suggested that RM initiatives in this area could encourage greater uptake
of home dialysis.
In Spain, respondents indicated that COPD and chronic heart failure had highest RM
potential and that they were high priority areas in their region. Hypertension was not seen as a
priority for the application of RM devices, as other chronic diseases were deemed to be associ-
ated with greater morbidity. One payer felt the potential of RM for home dialysis was lower
than other chronic diseases because they perceived the size of the affected patient population to
be smaller. Mental illness and anticoagulation were also mentioned as areas with potential for
application of RM.
In each of the countries studied, respondents indicated that they believed patients with rare,
more serious or multiple diseases would benefit most from RM (Table 2).

 In the UK, there was a strong indication towards patient stratification to identify patients
who could benefit most. In addition to patients with more serious and multiple diseases,
patients who have difficulty travelling to a nearby hospital, patients immediately discharged
from hospital who require close monitoring follow-up, and patients with frequent hospital
readmissions, were also cited as being likely to benefit from RM.
In Germany, respondents mentioned that patients in rural areas or where a doctor/hospital
is not easily accessible are the most likely to benefit from RM. Patients suffering from rare dis-
eases (e.g. congenital heart defects) and those immediately discharged from hospital were also
considered to be key candidates for RM.
In Italy, both patients for whom hospitalisation can be avoided, and younger patients, were
viewed as more eligible candidates for RM, while, in Spain, payers noted that RM would be
strongly applicable to chronic disease patients with certain characteristics who require a very spe-
cific follow-up, those who cannot travel to hospital but who could be examined or tested remotely,
and those with more serious diseases. There was a difference of opinion between respondents
about whether or not RM is more appropriate for patients with a single chronic disease (stated by
one respondent) or those with multiple co-morbidities (stated by other respondents).
Reimbursement for RM: findings from both desk and primary research
Coverage and implementation of reimbursement for RM varied by country. In the UK,
although there has been strong investment in telemedicine and RM from the NHS, a formal
reimbursement mechanism (directly enhanced services [DES]) has recently been abolished.
[12, 23] This scheme, the Remote Care Monitoring (Preparation) Scheme, made a payment of
£0.21 (GBP) per registered patient available to participating GP practices.[12] This initiative
was later removed due to lack of use, probably because the financial incentive was insufficient
to cover the cost of the administrative work involved.[37]
Funding for RM is decided at a regional level by clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in
England, and other funding streams are available at a national level through NHS England ini-
tiatives to support out-of-hospital care. An example is “A Call to Action: Commissioning for
Prevention”, which will fund RM projects commissioned by CCGs to help deliver different
models of care.[11] In the UK primary research interviews it was commented that the “Call to
Action” provides a good opportunity to engage with CCGs on RM projects, particularly if it
offers the potential to reduce hospital activity. A number of other national initiatives have been
driven by NHS England, aimed at promoting funding for RM. These include the ‘3millionlives’
campaign.[22]
This project aimed to provide benefit of RM/telemedicine to the estimated 3 million people
with long-term conditions by 2017.[22] Corporate partners, such as Tunstall (the largest sup-
plier of RM devices in UK), served on the Board of this plan.[38] The ‘3millionlives’ campaign
has now been superseded by the Technology Enabled Care Services, which aims “to help maxi-
mise the value of technology enabled care services for patients, carers, commissioners and the

 whole health economy.” [16] Other RM partnership opportunities exist, with funding for inno-
vative projects being coordinated by Academic Health Science Networks (AHSNs) between
commissioners and providers as part of CCGs 5-year strategic plans.
In Germany, general funding or reimbursement of telemedicine is not currently available at
a national level due to the lack of an EBM code. However, a ‘criteria catalogue’ was established
in 2013 in an effort to define indications/limits and provide guidance on what telemedicine
projects should include. In the absence of an EBM code, integrated care contracts (§ 140a
SGB V) are the most frequently used funding model, and funding is available for RM initiatives
in some regions (e.g. Bayern, Baden-Württemberg and Hessen) through integrated care con-
tracts negotiated between individual health insurers (Krankenkassen), manufacturers, and
physician organisations.[39] For national reimbursement to be considered, the clinical benefits
of RM would need to be demonstrated to the Federal Joint Committee (Gemeinsamer
Bundesausschuß, GBA) and the evaluation committee (Bewertungsausschuß) in order to obtain
an EBM code and associated value.
In Italy, Telemedicine National Guidelines (established by the Ministry of Health in Febru-
ary 2014) present a greater opportunity for national RM reimbursement, which could lead to
greater adoption of RM initiatives. The guidelines include principles on reimbursement and
the economic assessment of telemedicine services. For reimbursement purposes, a standardised
national tariff for telemedicine is proposed at a national level, which could also help fund RM
projects. DRG codes are found in two regions of Italy (Lombardy has a DRG code for RM for
chronic heart failure in the hospital setting only; Piedmont has a preliminary DRG that was
expected to be formalised in 2015), but there is none at the national level. The lack of a stan-
dardised national tariff is a barrier to wider adoption of RM projects.
In Spain, there is no national reimbursement mechanism for RM given that health compe-
tencies are transferred to the ACs, and telemedicine is funded in various regions. For example,
telemedicine for home haemodialysis (telenephrology) is being pioneered by two hospitals in
Canarias in partnership with Canarian Health Service. Telenephrology does not currently
include RM, but because there is a Canarias policy in place for telenephrology, reimbursement
for RM may follow in the future. In addition, ACs, such as Catalonia, are exploring co-pay-
ments to alleviate funding shortages and are seeking to partner with stakeholders such as man-
ufacturers to help drive the use of RM. In Spain, there is also a government-supported
initiative to develop a technological platform to help research groups obtain evidence for RM
and other forms of telemedicine that provide health care for chronic illnesses and dependency.
This initiative, the Platform of Innovation in Telehealth Systems (PITES), provides services
and tools for use by public and private research organisations.[30] Funding and support are
provided through the Research Unit for Telemedicine and Information Society (UITeS), a divi-
sion of Institute Carlos III.
Interviewee responses revealed differences between countries in the evidence (assessment
criteria) on which they would prefer to base decisions on the adoption of RM and the populations
that would derive most benefit (Table 3). In the UK, in addition to clinical and health economic
data, patient feedback was an important factor for both clinical experts and payers. In Italy,
respondents were interested in seeing cost-effectiveness data as well as cost-utility data for RM,
with real life data on effectiveness, safety and patient compliance also being mentioned as having
increasing value. In Germany, respondents were most interested in evidence showing an added
benefit of RM in certain patient groups as well as a reduction in patient hospitalisation due to
RM. In Spain, respondents were most interested in evidence of cost savings arising from RM, and
the quality of the patient experience with an RM device. Some of the cost drivers that payers
appeared to favour were RM programmes that could help with early disease diagnosis or disease
analytics to stratify patients by risk of hospital admission before complications arise.

 Some countries are pursuing their own programmes to obtain clinical/economic evidence for
the benefit of RM. For example, the UK Department of Health provided £31M for the 2008−2010
WSD study, which has not demonstrated clear cost-benefits to encourage wider RM uptake at the
GP level.[40] There is activity for RM and peritoneal dialysis in Spain. The eNefro project in Seville
to clinically and economically evaluate home RM for peritoneal dialysis is funded by Institute of
Carlos III.
Concerns, challenges and limitations—barriers to adoption of RM:
findings from desk and primary research
During the interviews, payers often commented that RM would help to keep patients out of
hospital, but changing standards of care is associated with many challenges (e.g. lack of align-
ment of incentives, misconceptions about the impact of RM on physician revenue, and the
need for convincing clinical and economic data for RM).
Experience of RM in the community home setting is primarily limited to studies in heart
failure, hypertension, diabetes, and COPD, and thus, despite acknowledgment of the benefit in
patient populations with multiple comorbidities, and the presence of heart failure in the ESRD
population, payers and policy makers were less convinced of the value of RM in ESRD patients.
[35] The definitions and policies remain unclear due to early stage of RM/telemedicine tech-
nology implementation and infrastructural issues (e.g. interoperability of electronic medical
record [EMR] systems, funding). Concerns about medical information sharing and the capital
investment required were also prominent, while privacy, liability, and security were significant
concerns expressed by the policy makers. Barriers to RM adoption identified in the four Euro-
pean countries studied are summarised in Table 4.
Discussion
Some common themes for all four of the European countries surveyed included the lack of clarity
in definitions and policies in RM due to the early stage of implementation of RM/telemedicine

 technology, and that the application of RM in a home-based setting is currently limited to a few
pilot studies in the areas of heart failure, diabetes, and COPD. Infrastructural issues, such as need
for interoperability of EMR systems and lack of funding/reimbursement, were also commonly
identified, and the need for robust clinical and cost-effectiveness data for RM was echoed across
all four countries.
In the countries studied, RM appears to have considerable public support for its potential to
increase healthcare efficiency in chronic diseases. However, there are inconsistent rates of RM
implementation due to disconnect between national and regional decisions, and reimburse-
ment/funding levels and incentives vary depending on the local adoption of RM and the depth
of RM research. Incentives to use RM technology were found to be rare. Heart failure seems to
be an area of greater awareness of the benefits of RM, both in terms of published studies and
expert opinion, possibly due to the greater prevalence of this condition and its higher morbid-
ity. Despite growing evidence for the use of RM in the management of patients with ESRD
(including peritoneal dialysis and home haemodialysis),[6, 7, 14] this disease had the lowest
recognition of RM value in this current research.
Efforts to develop technological standards are being made, although infrastructural IT chal-
lenges are currently a major barrier to wider adoption of RM in a number of European
Table 4. Barriers to adoption of RM in four European countries, identified from findings from desk
and primary research.
UK
• Lack of positive cost-effectiveness data has led to a weak value proposition for RM to Care
Commissioning Groups (CCGs) and General Practitioners (GPs); CCGs are reluctant to fund
the up-front capital investment for RM projects without proper cost-effectiveness evidence.
• Resistance from physicians on the potential change in practice that may lead from RM (e.g.
less face-to-face consultation, with perceived greater potential for patients to change GPs more
easily).
• Lack of integration of electronic medical records (EMRs) between primary and secondary care
making sharing of patients’ records harder.
• No national reimbursement mechanism currently exists for RM.
• Disconnect between national government and local implementation by CCGs (leading to
variable regional awareness of national RM campaigns).
Germany
• Lack of health economic and clinical benefit data on RM projects.
• Large providers unwilling to invest in RM without robust clinical and economic evidence.
• Krankenkassen (health insurers) that can invest in RM projects do not have the resources to
evaluate them.
• First version of the established criteria catalogue may be too general as guidance.
• IT infrastructural issues (e.g., interoperability between physicians and hospitals, implementing
eGK electronic health card system).
• Physicians’ fear of losing revenue.
• Data protection concerns may restrict implementation of RM.
Italy
• Lack of robust cost-effectiveness data.
• Lack of a national standardised tariff for telemedicine hinders RM national uptake.
• No regional DRG code or tariff established for RM in most regions.
• Insufficient funds to make novel additions to current care provision.
• Lack of central coordination to push RM at a national level.
Spain
• Economic downturn and financial constraints result in a reluctance to fund the capital
investment of RM initiatives.
• While the body of evidence grows, Autonomous Communities (ACs) are slowly, but steadily,
adopting RM initiatives.
• National technological standards remain an issue as interoperability varies between and
within ACs (with providers using different EMR systems).
• Regional differences in adoption, funding and implementation of RM projects.

 countries. Also, despite strong regional and/or national imperatives that are supporting the use
of RM, the lack of standardised national tariffs may be hindering the introduction of RM. How-
ever, budgetary restrictions can be overcome by exploring opportunities with innovative fund-
ing streams, such as the involvement of corporate partners (for example, Tunstall, major
suppliers of RM devices, supported the ‘3millionlives’ campaign in the UK),[38] and the poten-
tial to offset costs of RM through savings in service delivery.
Increasing healthcare expenses will continue to drive a need for more affordable options
and there is evidence that use of RM can decrease the cost of healthcare delivery. Moreover, the
time saved as a result of RM implementation could increase efficiency, and would allow health-
care providers to allocate more time to remotely educate and communicate with patients. The
‘Virtual Ward’ healthcare model is an example from the UK that uses an approach of risk strat-
ification and integrated care, and demonstrated a reduction in costs, elective hospital admis-
sions and outpatient attendance.[18, 41] In this model, originally described by Lewis in 2006,
[42] each virtual ward is linked to a group of GP practices, and a patient is offered ‘admission’
to a ward if he/she is predicted to be at high risk of a future unplanned hospital admission. The
patient remains in the community during their time on the virtual ward, and receives health
and social care from a multidisciplinary team, which may be delivered by telephone, in the
patient’s home, and/or at a local clinic.[41, 42] Due to its home based and virtual nature, virtual
wards may be a suitable setting for piloting and launch of RM technologies.
Collaboration with appropriate local, regional or national partners is likely to be of value in
the development of RM initiatives. For example, in the UK, the AHSNs have the potential to
transform health and healthcare by putting innovation at the heart of the NHS. Acting as the
key link between commissioners, providers, local authorities and industry, AHSNs have access
to funding mechanisms to help explore the benefits of projects like RM initiatives, particularly
where there are potential cost-saving benefits in delivering care closer to patients. AHSNs are
also likely to collaborate with CCGs on RM initiatives where there is the potential to reduce the
reliance on hospitals and the more costly care they provide.
In summary, in the four European countries surveyed, RM has attracted considerable inter-
est for its potential to increase the efficiency of healthcare for chronic diseases. However, the
rates of implementation have been inconsistent due largely to a lack of alignment between
national and regional decisions and challenges around varying RM technologies. A lack of
standardised national tariffs may be hindering the introduction and more widespread use of
RM, although there are examples of RM adoption within each country, presumably with exist-
ing budgets.
The value of RM is multifaceted (e.g. patient outcomes, provider efficiency, societal impact)
and, as such, represents a measurement challenged. Although telemedicine programs were ini-
tiated several decades ago and have experienced rapid growth ever since, there is a lack of reli-
able, comparative economic data for policy makers, program administrators, and other
stakeholders. Most of the economic evaluations of telemedicine focus on program/technology
cost estimates alone, and the full range of economic benefits of telemedicine programs is rarely
considered and quantified, making it difficult for decision makers to compare different pro-
grams and to make an informed decision as to which are worth implementing from a societal
perspective.[38, 43] Incentives, whether financial or otherwise, are likely to emerge as the body
of evidence demonstrating the clinical, time- and cost-saving benefits of RM grows. It will also
be important to explore existing programs for chronic disease management that may benefit
from including RM, and new funding opportunities, particularly for RM, at the regional and
national levels.
The main limitation of this study is that it focused specifically on RM. Whilst one might
expect that the perceived value and hurdles would be the same for telemedicine in general, a

 study focusing on the broader elements of telemedicine and/or telehealth would need to be
conducted to identify similarities and validate our findings.
