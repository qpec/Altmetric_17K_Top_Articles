On June 17, 2016, this report was posted as an MMWR Early 
Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).
Transfusion-transmitted infections have been documented for 
several arboviruses, including West Nile and dengue viruses (1). 
Zika virus, a flavivirus transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti 
mosquitoes that has been identified as a cause of congenital 
microcephaly and other serious brain defects (2), became rec-
ognized as a potential threat to blood safety after reports from a 
2013–2014 outbreak in French Polynesia. Blood safety concerns 
were based on very high infection incidence in the population 
at large during epidemics, the high percentage of persons with 
asymptomatic infection, the high proportion of blood donations 
with evidence of Zika virus nucleic acid upon retrospective test-
ing, and an estimated 7–10-day period of viremia (3). At least 
one instance of transfusion transmission of Zika virus has been 
documented in Brazil after the virus emerged there, likely in 
2014 (4). Rapid epidemic spread spread has followed to other 
areas of the Americas, including Puerto Rico.
In February 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
issued recommendations for donor screening, donor deferral, 
and product management to reduce the risk for transfusion-
transmitted Zika virus in the United States and its territories 
(5). In addition to behavioral- and health-risk questionnaires 
for blood donors in all areas, FDA recommends deferrals for 
donors in unaffected areas who recently lived in or visited an 
area with active mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus. 
For establishments collecting blood in areas with active, local 
mosquito-borne transmission, such as Puerto Rico and other 
U.S. territories, the recommendations include discontinuing 
local blood collections and importing blood units from unaf-
fected areas of the continental United States unless one of the 
following is implemented: 1) Zika virus screening of locally 
collected blood donations or 2) treatment of locally collected 
units with pathogen-reduction technology (FDA-approved 
only for plasma and apheresis platelets). In Puerto Rico, inter-
ventions initially were limited to importation of blood units 
from unaffected U.S. areas and to treatment of plasma and 
apheresis platelets with pathogen-reduction technology; no 
Zika virus screening test was available. On April 3, 2016, Zika 
virus screening of locally collected blood donations was imple-
mented using a newly developed nucleic acid test (NAT) (cobas 
Zika, Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Pleasanton, California) 
authorized by FDA under an investigational new drug appli-
cation (IND) (6). As part of the IND, plasma samples from 
blood donors are screened individually, and specimens with 
reactive results are subjected to additional testing including 
an alternate NAT and immunoglobulin M serology. A blood 
donation with an initial reactive result by NAT is regarded as a 
presumptive viremic donor, indicating an infected donor, and 
is interdicted and removed from the blood supply. 
During April 3–June 11, 2016, a total of 68 (0.5%) presump-
tive viremic donors were identified from 12,777 donations 
tested. The highest weekly incidence was 1.1% for the latest 
week of reporting, June 5–June 11, and incidence has been 
increasing over time (Figure). 
Although the blood donor population of Puerto Rico is 
not intended to be statistically representative of the general 
population, the increasing prevalence of Zika virus nucleic 
acid among blood donors likely reflects an overall increase in 
infection incidence in the population at large. Based on data 
from previous outbreaks caused by arboviruses transmitted by 
Aedes aegypti, the high incidence often associated with these 
outbreaks can result in a substantial proportion of the popula-
tion becoming infected. For example, chikungunya virus was 
introduced into Puerto Rico in 2014. Retrospective screening 
for chikungunya virus nucleic acid was performed on blood 
donations collected during June–December 2014, and the 
estimated detectable viremia was 0.65%, with a peak of 2.1% 
in October. Testing for chikungunya virus immunoglobulin M 
antibody of retained individual blood donation samples obtained 
during March 1–9, 2015, suggested that nearly 25% of the 
Puerto Rico population became infected during the previous 
year’s epidemic (7). Because viremia is only present days after 
acute infection, immunoglobulin M antibody can provide a 
more precise estimate of the burden of recent infection. The 
2014–2015 chikungunya virus data suggest that detection of 
viremia in a relatively small proportion of blood donors each 
week can reflect a substantial proportion of the general popula-
tion becoming infected during the course of an epidemic season.
Currently, no medication or vaccine is available to treat or 
prevent Zika virus disease. Prevention relies on avoidance of 
mosquito bites, elimination of mosquito breeding sites, com-
munity mosquito control, and taking measures to prevent 
sexual transmission. Screening of the U.S. blood supply using

nucleic acid tests has markedly reduced the risk for transfu-
sion transmission for multiple pathogens, including for West 
Nile virus after it was associated with arboviral epidemics in 
the United States. Measures to protect the blood supply from 
Zika virus, including donor deferrals, laboratory screening, 
and pathogen reduction technology, are expected to similarly 
reduce the risk for transfusion transmission.
