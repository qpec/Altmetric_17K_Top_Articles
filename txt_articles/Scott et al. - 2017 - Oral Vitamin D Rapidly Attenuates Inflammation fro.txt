The diverse immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D are increasingly being recognized. However, the ability of
oral vitamin D to modulate acute inflammation in vivo has not been established in humans. In a double-
blinded, placebo-controlled interventional trial, 20 healthy adults were randomized to receive either placebo
or a high dose of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) one hour after experimental sunburn induced by an erythemo-
genic dose of UVR. Compared with placebo, participants receiving vitamin D3 (200,000 international units)
demonstrated reduced expression of proinflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor-a (P ¼ 0.04) and
inducible nitric oxide synthase (P ¼ 0.02) in skin biopsy specimens 48 hours after experimental sunburn. A
blinded, unsupervised hierarchical clustering of participants based on global gene expression profiles revealed
that participants with significantly higher serum vitamin D3 levels after treatment (P ¼ 0.007) demonstrated
increased skin expression of the anti-inflammatory mediator arginase-1 (P ¼ 0.005), and a sustained reduction in
skin redness (P ¼ 0.02), correlating with significant expression of genes related to skin barrier repair. In contrast,
participants with lower serum vitamin D3 levels had significant expression of proinflammatory genes. Together
the data may have broad implications for the immunotherapeutic properties of vitamin D in skin homeostasis,
and implicate arginase-1 upregulation as a previously unreported mechanism by which vitamin D exerts anti-
inflammatory effects in humans.

INTRODUCTION
Vitamin D is a ubiquitous fat-soluble hormone important in
calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism (Jackson et al.,
2006). The majority of vitamin D arises from de novo
synthesis in the skin triggered by UVR, with smaller con-
tributions from dietary sources (Bikle, 2011). Although
considerable attention has been placed on vitamin D defi-
ciency and optimizing supplementation strategies, appre-
ciation for the diverse biological effects and long-term
outcomes of vitamin D now include the modulation of
immune responses, inflammatory disease, cardiovascular
health, and carcinogenesis (Giovannucci et al., 2006;
Martins et al., 2007; Rosen, 2011; Sanders et al., 2010;
Wobke et al., 2014). However, there is a lack of evidence
demonstrating that intervention with vitamin D is capable of
resolving acute inflammation in target tissues and organs in
humans.
Keratinocytes and macrophages produce active vitamin D
within the skin (Baeke et al., 2010; Bikle et al., 1986). Vitamin D
has pleiotropic effects on the immune system, including the
enhancement of antimicrobial responses, induction of auto-
phagy,
and
suppression
of
proinflammatory
mediators,
including tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) (Di Rosa et al., 2012;
Liu et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2012). We recently demonstrated
that intervention with a single dose of vitamin D is capable of
rapidlyattenuating an inflammatory response in a mouse model
of chemical induced skin injury through inhibition of inducible
nitric oxide synthase (iNOS; or NOS2 gene) and TNF-a (or
TNFA gene) by activated macrophages (Au et al., 2015).
Therefore, we designed a pilot, proof-of-principle interventional
study in humans, modeled after a randomized, double-blinded,
placebo-controlled clinical trial, to test the hypothesis that a
single high dose of oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) would be
capable of rapidly attenuating experimental sunburn induced
by simulated solar radiation (SSR).
RESULTS
Dose-dependent response of high-dose oral vitamin D3 and
UV irradiation
Subjects randomized to receive various doses of vitamin D were
divided into 4 categories (Figure 1a), whereas the overall study
design constituting the control phase and an investigative phase
(Figure 1b) required monitoring of subjects for a total of 6 weeks.
The randomized treatment groups did not differ in their baseline
characteristics (Table 1). No participant was taking supplemental

 vitamin D3 before study initiation. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3
(25(OH)D3), a marker of vitamin D3 stores, increased after
treatment
in
a
vitamin
D3
dose-dependent
fashion
(Supplementary Figure S1a online). Similar trends were observed
for the active form of vitamin D3, 1,25(OH)2D3, as well as an
inactive breakdown product, 24,25(OH)2D3 (Supplementary
Figure S1b). No measured vitamin D3 metabolite increased into
a toxic range in any of the treatment groups throughout the study
period. Furthermore, there were no instances of clinically sig-
nificant hypercalcemia occurring in any of the treatment groups
throughout the study period (Supplementary Figure S2 online).
Sunburn is a stereotypical inflammatory response induced by
exposure to an erythemogenic dose of UVR. Sunburn is char-
acterized clinically by redness, mediated by dermal vasodila-
tation, and edema, mediatedbyincreasedvascular permeability
and inflammatory cell infiltration (Clydesdale et al., 2001;
Cooper et al., 1993; Ouhtit et al., 2000). Although skin
rednesspeaksearlyafterUVRexposure,skinthicknessincreases
steadily for up to 2 weeks after irradiation (Clydesdale et al.,
2001; Ouhtit et al., 2000). Compared with one minimal ery-
thema dose (MED), exposure to 2MED increased skin erythema
24 hours and 48 hours after irradiation, and exposure to 3MED
increased skin thickness 72 hours and 1 week after irradiation (P
< 0.05 for all) (Supplementary Figure S3a, S3b online). We
observed saturation of skin redness after exposure to 3MED,
limitingtheabilitytodiscernsubtledifferencesamongtreatment
groups with this high dose of UVR.
High-dose oral vitamin D3 attenuates skin inflammation
Clinically, irradiated skin appeared red and swollen 48 hours
after UVR exposure (Figure 2a). Irradiated skin also displayed
histologic evidence of structural damage as compared with
nonirradiated skin, including epidermal vesiculation and
edema formation, which improved in a vitamin D3 dose-
dependent fashion (Figure 2b). Skin expression of TNF-a
and iNOS was lower in participants receiving 200,000 in-
ternational units (IU) D3 as compared with placebo 48 hours
after irradiation (P ¼ 0.04 for TNF-a; P¼ 0.02 for iNOS)
(Figure 2c). With higher doses of vitamin D3, there was a
trend for decreased skin thickness after irradiation, which
reached significance in the 100,000 IU D3 group at both 72
hours (P ¼ 0.03) and 1 week (P ¼ 0.02) after irradiation
(Supplementary Table S1 online). Comparison of global gene
expression profiles among the treatment groups revealed that

 the 200,000 IU D3 group had a distinct gene expression
profile that was very different from the placebo group, and
most closely related to the 100,000 IU D3 group (Figure 2d).
Elevated serum levels of 25(OH)D3 correlate with decreased
skin redness
To further investigate a potential link between vitamin D3 and
gene expression, we analyzed the global gene expression
profiles of all participants, blinded to their allocated treat-
ment groups. The dendrogram resulting from this analysis
produced two clusters of participants (Figure 3a), represent-
ing an unbiased, unsupervised hierarchical clustering of all
individuals based on similarities in gene expression profiles.
Of note, ARG (arginase)-1, known to enhance tissue repair
and inhibit inflammation through the utilization of iNOS
precursors, was significantly downregulated in cluster 1
(P ¼ 0.016) and upregulated in cluster 2 (P ¼ 0.046)
(Figure 3a) (Bronte and Zanovello, 2005). Increased ARG1
gene expression observed in cluster 2 compared with clus-
ter 1 was subsequently validated with quantitative real-time
reverse transcriptase-PCR (P ¼ 0.005) (Figure 3b). Addition-
ally,
confocal
microscopy
analysis
of
a
representative
participant from cluster 2 revealed increased expression of
the arginase-1 protein localized to CD163þ macrophages
after vitamin D3 treatment (Figure 3c).
Unblinding of the participants’ demographics and treatment
group allocation revealed that the two clusters of participants did
not differ in their baseline characteristics (Supplementary
Table S2 online). However, cluster 1 contained all participants
randomized to receive placebo, as well as a mixture of partici-
pants from the various vitamin D3 treatment groups (Figure 3a).
Cluster 2 predominately contained participants who had
received higher doses of vitamin D3, and notably none of the
participants who had received placebo. Although the two clus-
ters had similar baseline serum 25(OH)D3 levels, participants in
cluster 2 had significantly higher 25(OH)D3 levels after treatment
as compared with participants in clusters 1 (P < 0.05 for all time
points) (Figure 4a). When subjects receiving placebo were
excluded from this analysis, serum 25(OH)D3 levels after treat-
ment remained lower for participants in cluster 1 as compared
withparticipantsincluster2(P< 0.05for24hours, 48hours, and
1 week) (Figure 4b). Wewill now refer toparticipantsfromcluster
2 as vitamin D3 responders and participants from cluster 1 as
vitamin D3 nonresponders.
As indicated above, body mass index, age, gender, and base-
line 25(OH)D3 stores had no effect on the serum response to oral
vitamin D3. Furthermore, along with higher serum 25(OH)D3
levels, vitamin D3 responders demonstrated a statistically signif-
icant sustained reduction in skin redness at all time points after
irradiation as compared with vitamin D3 nonresponders (P <
0.05 for all) (Figure 4c), and a trend for reduced skin thickness 1
week after irradiation (P ¼ 0.09; data not shown).
Differential gene expression profiles characterize vitamin
D3 responders and vitamin D3 nonresponders
Vitamin D3 nonresponders displayed upregulation of various
proinflammatory genes not observed in the gene expression
profiles of vitamin D3 responders, including matrix metal-
loproteinases (MMP1, MMP3), interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1A), and
monocyte chemokines (CCL2) (Supplementary Figure S4a
online). Likewise, canonical pathways related to leukocyte
migration and IL-6 signaling were significantly activated in
vitamin D3 nonresponders, including TNF-a as a predicted
upstream regulator (P < 0.0001 for all) (Supplementary
Figure S4b). Conversely, vitamin D3 nonresponders displayed
a strikingly different gene expression profile, characterized by
upregulation of genes implicated in skin barrier repair,
including tissue transglutaminases (TGM3, TGM5), keratins
(KRT78, KRT80), corneodesmosin (CDSN), and calmodulin-
like 5 (CALML5) (Supplementary Figure S4a).
DISCUSSION
In this pilot, proof-of-principle human interventional study
modeled after a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-
controlled trial, we provide in vivo evidence that a single
high dose of oral vitamin D3 is capable of rapidly attenuating
a
local
inflammatory
response
to
UVR.
Participants
responding to high doses of vitamin D3 demonstrated a sus-
tained reduction in skin redness after experimental sunburn,
as well as less epidermal structural damage, reduced

 expression of proinflammatory markers in the skin, and a
gene expression profile characterized by upregulation of skin
barrier repair genes. This study also demonstrates that
regardless of baseline serum vitamin D3 levels, a single high
dose of oral vitamin D3 is safe, with serum vitamin D3 and
calcium concentrations remaining within a normal reference
range (Rosen, 2011). The simplicity and safety of high-dose
oral vitamin D3 treatment, combined with its rapid and sus-
tained therapeutic efficacy, suggest that these proof-of-
concept findings may ultimately be translated to routine
clinical use once larger studies are performed on diverse
populations of subjects (Ilahi et al., 2008; Sanders et al.,
2010).
Moreover, upregulation of arginase-1 is associated with the
anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D3 in humans (Figure 5).
Although arginase has been identified to be present at phys-
iological levels in inflammatory skin diseases, tumors, and
chronic wounds, to our knowledge the induction of arginase-
1 expression by vitamin D3 in human skin in vivo is previ-
ously unreported (Abd-El-Aleem et al., 2000; Bruch-Gerharz
et al., 2003; Gokmen et al., 2001). These findings suggest that
arginase-1 may also be a clinically useful tissue biomarker for
monitoring the immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D3 in
humans. Given the presence of a putative vitamin D3
response element upstream of the ARG1 promoter, future
studies should be aimed at defining the mechanism by which
vitamin D3 treatment activates the arginase-1 pathway
(Andrukhova et al., 2014).
Exploratory analyses suggest that the host’s response to
vitamin D3 intervention plays a critical role in the modulation
of inflammation. Participants segregated into two clusters
based on similarities in global gene expression profiles, and
these two clusters differed significantly in their serum vitamin
D3 levels after treatment. The pharmacokinetic properties of
oral vitamin D3 are complex, however, and an individual’s
serum response to oral vitamin D3 depends on the dose of
vitamin D3, age, body mass index, baseline vitamin D3
stores, and genetic polymorphisms (Didriksen et al., 2013;
Ilahi et al., 2008). Large randomized, double-blinded, pla-
cebo-controlled trials will be required to elucidate factors

 responsible for the therapeutic variability of vitamin D3
treatment within populations and to determine whether in-
dividuals with lower baseline vitamin D3 levels require
higher treatment doses to achieve immunomodulation.
Exposure to erythemogenic doses of UVR initiates an influx
of inflammatory cells into the skin, generating a microenvi-
ronment rich in inflammatory mediators (Cooper et al., 1993;
Ouhtit et al., 2000). Specifically, release of TNF-a by
damaged keratinocytes and other inflammatory cells plays a
crucial
role
in
initiating
and
sustaining
UVR-induced
inflammation (Clydesdale et al., 2001; Di Rosa et al.,
2012). Following an inflammatory insult, classically acti-
vated M1-polarized macrophages infiltrate the skin and
produce iNOS as part of an oxidative burst in an evolution-
arily conserved attempt to prevent infection (Bronte and
Zanovello, 2005; Mills, 2012). However, excessive produc-
tion of iNOS perpetuates tissue damage, retards the resolu-
tion of inflammation, and prevents tissue repair (Bronte and
Zanovello, 2005; Mills, 2012). We and others have shown
using murine models that vitamin D3 inhibits the production
of TNF-a, and is capable of attenuating skin inflammation by
reducing macrophage-specific iNOS production (Au et al.,
2015; Zhang et al., 2012).
In the presence of retinoic acid, vitamin D3 induces the
in vitro differentiation of monocytes into alternatively acti-
vated,
M2-polarized
CD163þ
macrophages
expressing
arginase-1 (Di Rosa et al., 2012; Takahashi et al., 2014).
Furthermore, it has been shown that exposure to acute UVR
increases endogenous retinoids in the skin of mice (Gressel
et al., 2015). Taken together, our results combined with
these data suggest that a potential mechanism by which
vitamin D3 mediates resolution of experimental sunburn is
via the upregulation of arginase-1 by endogenous repair
molecules, leading to the selective induction of anti-
inflammatory, M2-polarized CD163þ macrophages. Addi-
tionally, vitamin D3 may have other protective mechanisms
in skin, including reducing DNA damage and keratinocyte
apoptosis after experimental sunburn, as was shown in mice
treated topically with the active form of vitamin D3 imme-
diately after exposure to UVR (Dixon et al., 2007).
It is likely that the generation of vitamin D3 from choles-
terol precursors in the skin after UVR evolved to perform vital
homeostatic functions (Bikle, 2011). Moreover, skin-resident
cells are capable of locally converting vitamin D3 into its
active form, which can then signal in an intracrine, autocrine,
and paracrine fashion to exert diverse biological effects
(Bikle, 2011; Di Rosa et al., 2012). It is worthwhile to
conjecture that vitamin D3 may provide an “endocrine bar-
rier” within the skin, utilizing energy derived from sunlight to
reduce inflammation, and promote wound healing, tissue
repair, and an enhanced epidermal barrier. This would pro-
vide the host with additional protection against environ-
mental insults by complementing the classically described
brick and mortar mechanical, melanin pigment, and Lang-
erhans cell immunologic barriers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Screening, randomization, and study design
The Institutional Review Board at University Hospitals Cleveland
Medical Center approved this pilot study, which was conducted
between March 2013 and February 2015. The study was modeled
after a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. The
trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02920502). Twenty-
seven healthy adults 18 years and older were screened for eligi-
bility and provided written informed consent (Figure 1a). A total of
25 participants were randomized to receive, in a double-blinded
fashion, either placebo or a single oral dose of vitamin D3 (chole-
calciferol) at 50,000, 100,000, or 200,000 IU one hour after SSR
exposure. UVR was administrated as SSR emitted from a 1,000 W
Xenon arc lamp (Newport, Stratford, CT), a full spectrum light source
that closely resembles natural sunlight (Clydesdale et al., 2001).
This study was designed in a parallel fashion with exposure to SSR
occurring on one arm without study drug administration (control
phase), followed 2 weeks later by exposure to SSR on the contra-
lateral arm with study drug administration (investigative phase)
(Figure 1b). The MED to experimentally induce sunburn was

 determined for each participant during the initial screening visit as
previously described (Heckman et al., 2013). Participants were
irradiated with one, two, and three times the MED on the sun-
shielded, upper arm using plastic holed templates to ensure that
adjacent skin was not exposed. A total of 20 participants completed
both phases of the study and were included in the per-protocol
analysis.

The concentrations of the vitamin D3 metabolites 25(OH)D3,
1,25(OH)2D3, and 24,25(OH)2D3, as well as total serum calcium,
were measured from freshly frozen serum obtained during the
screening visit, as well as 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and 1 week
after receiving the study drug. Serum levels of 25(OH)D3 (ng/ml) and
1,25(OH)2D3 (pg/ml) were measured by Liaison assay, and serum
levels

24,25(OH)2D3
(ng/ml)
were
measured
by
liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (Heartland Assays, Ames, IA).
Toxic serum 25(OH)D3 levels were defined as those greater than
150 ng/ml (Holick, 2003). Total serum calcium was measured by the
University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center core laboratory
(Cleveland, OH), and the normal reference range was considered
8.8e10.7 mg/dl.
Primary outcomes of randomized participants
Primary outcomes included noninvasive measurements of skin ery-
thema and thickness 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and 1 week after
irradiation, as well as tissue expression of TNF-a and iNOS 48 hours
after irradiation. Skin erythema (redness) was quantified using a
CR300 chromameter (Minolta, Ramsey, NJ). The difference in ery-
thema (Da*) between irradiated and nonirradiated skin (a*irrad e
a*nonirrad) was calculated for each time point after SSR exposure
(Da*time). The difference in Da*time between the investigative and
control phases of the study was calculated to determine the effect of
the study drug on skin redness after SSR exposure [(Da*time)invest e
(Da*time)control].
Figure 5. The effect of oral vitamin D3 intervention on skin inflammation. (a) Levels of vitamin D3 are at baseline levels in the absence of high-dose oral
vitamin D3 intervention. In this context, exposure to erythemogenic doses of UVR results in sunburn and the release of proinflammatory cytokines and
chemokines in the skin, including TNF-a and iNOS, which further propagate tissue inflammation. Increased skin redness and thickness are mediated by
vasodilation, an influx of inflammatory cells, and vascular congestion within the skin. The gene expression profile of skin at this time is characterized by
increased expression of various proinflammatory genes. (b) Levels of vitamin D3 rapidly rise within the serum after high-dose oral vitamin D3 intervention.
Arginase-1 is upregulated within the skin, and production of the proinflammatory mediators TNF-a and iNOS is attenuated after sunburn. Reduced skin
erythema and thickness are observed clinically. The gene expression profile of skin at this time is characterized by increased expression of skin barrier genes,
which help to repair the epidermal barrier and attenuate the inflammatory insult. iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; TNF-a, tumor necrosis factor-a.

 Skin thickness, an acute measure of edema, was quantified using
a Mitutoyo 9 mm dial caliper (Northamptonshire, UK). Thickness
measurements were repeated in triplicate and the mean was used for
all calculations. The difference in thickness (Dth) between irradiated
and nonirradiated skin (thirrad e thnonirrad) was calculated for each
time point after SSR exposure (Dthtime). The difference in Dthtime
between the investigative and control phases of the study was
calculated to determine the effect of the study drug on skin thickness
after UVR exposure [(Dthtime)invest e (Dthtime)control].
A 6-mm punch biopsy specimen was obtained from the 3MED
site 48 hours after irradiation in both the control and investigative
phases of the study. RNA was extracted from fresh frozen tissue using
the RNeasy Lipid Mini Kit (Qiagen, Redwood City, CA), and tissue
mRNA expression of TNF-a and iNOS was quantified as previously
described (Au et al., 2015). A fold change representing the difference
in RNA expression between the investigative and control phases of
the study was calculated for TNF-a and iNOS [(RNA48hr)invest/
(RNA48hr)control].
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of participants
An exploratory analysis was performed utilizing clusters obtained
from the unsupervised hierarchical clustering of individual par-
ticipants based on similarities in their gene expression profiles,
regardless of the allocated treatment group. A minimum of 3 mg
of total RNA was submitted to the Gene Expression and Geno-
typing facility at Case Western Reserve University for microarray
analysis (Cleveland, OH). Human Genome 2.0 ST arrays (Affy-
metrix, Santa Clara, CA) were the chosen platform to analyze
transcriptomic changes incurred by treatment. For microarray
analyses, normalized linear data post-(Tinterv) and pre-(Tcontrol)
study drug intervention were averaged amongst the 18 partici-
pants. The microarray raw data for two participants was not
interpretable given poor sample quality. A fold change repre-
senting the difference in RNA log expression between the
investigative and control phases of the study was determined for
each gene for each participant [(RNA48hr)invest � (RNA48hr)control].
Data
analysis
was
performed
using
Rv3.2.2/Bioconductor
(R Studio, Boston, MA). The oligo package was used to read,
background correct, and normalize the raw sample data using the
Robust Multiarray Average algorithm (Bolstad et al., 2003). The
limma package was used to create a paired design matrix and
conduct differential gene expression analysis based on a linear
model fit and empirical Bayes methodology (Ritchie et al., 2015).
Heatmaps and dendrograms were generated utilizing 26,599
transcripts with unique gene names using the GENE-E software
(http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/GENE-E/index.html,
Accessed June 14, 2016). Hierarchical clustering was used to
recursively merge samples based on pairwise distance, determined
using the 1-Pearson correlation coefficient and average linkage
methods. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen, www.qiagen.com/
ingenuity) was used to determine statistically significant canonical
pathways, predicted upstream regulators, and biological networks
most likely affected by the set of genes differentially expressed for
each group of participants.
Tissue ARG1 mRNA expression was quantified using quanti-
tative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR as described above. To
analyze the expression of the arginase-1 protein in skin, freshly
frozen biopsy samples embedded in optimal cutting temperature
compound were cut into 8-mm sections and stained immuno-
fluorescently as previously described (Au et al., 2015). CD163
was used as a marker for skin macrophages, and DAPI was used to
stain nuclear DNA.
Statistical analysis
Given the pilot nature of the study design, power calculations were
not performed. To control for type I error rate, hierarchical closed-
testing procedures were utilized for analysis of primary outcomes.
Unpaired t-tests were used to compare the means of groups with
respect to changes in the primary outcomes at each time point.
Fisher’s exact test was used for intergroup comparisons of categorical
data and for determining significance of the canonical pathways.
The Benjamini-Hochberg correction was used to determine differ-
entially expressed genes in the microarray analysis, adjusting for
multiple comparisons (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). A two-sided
P-value of 0.05 or less was considered to indicate statistical
significance.

Editor’s Note
During the review of this article, questions arose
concerning the post-enrollment trial registration date
reported herein. The authors have explained this as
follows:
“Our aim was to conduct a proof-of-concept study
demonstrating that vitamin D can modulate acute
inflammation in target tissues and, secondarily, to
discover new skin repair genes in vivo. No established
studies were available to inform on dosing to corre-
late with biologic activity in the skin. Therefore dose-
finding was also incorporated in conceptualizing this
study. To achieve rigor in the data and remove
potential bias, the pilot study was modeled after a
randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial
design. The findings in this study and the results from
exploratory analysis with gene array will help define
parameters for primary and secondary outcomes in
larger clinical trials. In preparation of the manuscript,
we learned that medical journals have a broader
definition
of
clinical
trials
than
the
FDA.
Pre-
registration
for
this
pilot
study
was
not
done
because our understanding was that non-regulated
supplements such as Vitamin D did not constitute
an applicable clinical trial. Since learning of the
International Committee of Medical Journal Editors
guidelines, the study was retrospectively registered
and the data were made available.”
The JID requires preregistration of all clinical trials
as part of its broad interest in assuring that all pub-
lished data are free of bias of any kind. In this case,
however, it is the Editor’s judgment that sharing these
results has priority and the investigators’ misunder-
standing of what constitutes a clinical trial should not
preclude publication.
