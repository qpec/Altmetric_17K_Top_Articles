ABSTRACT
Background: Fortified cow milk is a material contributor of vitamin
D and dietary fat in children. Recommendations for children .2 y of
age advise reduced milk-fat consumption to reduce childhood obe-
sity, yet the relation between lower milk fat, vitamin D stores, and
body mass index (BMI) is unclear.
Objectives: The primary objective was to explore the association
between milk-fat percentage and both BMI z score (zBMI) and
venous 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]; the secondary objective
was to assess whether milk volume consumed modified this relation.
Design: This was a cross-sectional analysis. Healthy urban children
aged 12–72 mo were recruited from 9 primary health care practices
within The Applied Research Group for Kids (TARGet Kids!) re-
search group in Toronto, Canada. We used adjusted bivariate linear
regression to examine the relation between milk-fat percentage and
child 25(OH)D and zBMI concurrently. Effect modification by milk
volume consumed on the evaluated relations was explored with the
use of an interaction term in the statistical model.
Results: Among the 2745 included children there was a positive
association between milk-fat percentage and 25(OH)D (P = 0.006)
and a negative association between milk-fat percentage and zBMI
(P , 0.0001). Participants who drank whole milk had a 5.4-nmol/L
(95% CI: 4.32, 6.54) higher median 25(OH)D concentration and
a 0.72 lower (95% CI: 0.68, 0.76) zBMI score than children who
drank 1% milk. Milk volume consumed modified the effect of
milk-fat percentage on 25(OH)D (P = 0.003) but not on zBMI
(P = 0.77).
Conclusions: Whole milk consumption among healthy young chil-
dren was associated with higher vitamin D stores and lower BMI.
Longitudinal and interventional studies are needed to confirm
these findings. TARGet Kids! was registered at clinicaltrials.
gov as NCT01869530.

INTRODUCTION
Vitamin D is essential for healthy bone development and the
prevention of rickets (1, 2). In North America, the main dietary
contributor of vitamin D is fortified cow milk. Legislation requires
all cow milk to be fortified to w100 IU/250-mL cup (3–6). The
National Institutes of Health, Health Canada, and the American
Academy of Pediatrics recommend that children between 1 and
2 y old consume whole cow milk. For children .2 y, 2 servings of
low fat (1% or 2%) milk are recommended each day to limit fat
intake and reduce the incidence of childhood obesity (4, 7–9).
The main indicator and chief circulating form of vitamin D in the
blood is 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration [25(OH)D]9 (10).
Childhood obesity in North America has tripled in the past
30 y (11), yet children’s consumption of whole cow milk (3.25%
fat) has halved during the same period (12). Several studies have
suggested a relation between higher milk-fat consumption and
lower risk of childhood obesity (13–17). Furthermore, adi-
posity and vitamin D stores are known to manifest in an inverse
relation in several studies of children (18–24). Evidence sup-
ports a relation between higher dietary fat consumption and
vitamin D stores (25, 26); however, the milk-fat concentration
that maximizes 25(OH)D and minimizes adiposity in children
is unknown. Similar studies that have evaluated nutritional
trade-offs related to milk consumption, such as the inverse
relation between iron and vitamin D stores, have been clini-
cally useful (27).
The primary aim of our study was to determine the relation
between milk-fat percentage and both 25(OH)D concentration
and BMI in healthy preschool-age children. The secondary
objective was to analyze how the milk volume that children

METHODS
Study design
Our cross-sectional study was conducted on 2745 children
through The Applied Research Group for Kids (TARGet Kids!)
Collaboration. TARGet Kids! is a partnership between the Uni-
versity of Toronto’s Faculty of Medicine and clinicians in the
university’s Departments of Pediatrics and Family and Com-
munity Medicine (28).
Trained research assistants recruited children aged 12–72 mo
during health supervision visits between September 2008 and
August 2014 at 9 primary care clinics in Toronto, Canada. Ex-
clusion criteria were growth-altering disorders (e.g., failure to
thrive), chronic conditions (excluding asthma), or substantial
developmental impairment.
Exposures and outcomes
Parents answered a standardized data collection instrument
adapted from the Canadian Community Health Survey (29),
which was used to collect clinical data; research assistants
gathered anthropometric measurements from children. Trained
phlebotomists obtained venous blood, which was sent daily in
chilled batches to the Mount Sinai Services laboratory in Toronto.
The primary exposure was the milk-fat percentage consumed
by each child and was measured as a continuous variable by asking
the parent, “Please specify your child’s diet for the past 3 days:
skim, 1%, 2%, or whole milk.” The mean value was calculated for
subjects consuming .1 type of milk.
There were 2 primary outcomes: serum 25(OH)D, and BMI z
score (zBMI). Serum 25(OH)D was quantified by use of a 2-step
competitive chemiluminescence assay from venous blood
(LIAISON 25 OH Vitamin D TOTAL; DiaSorin) (30), which has
an intra-assay inaccuracy of 7.2% at 213 nmol/L and an inter-
assay inaccuracy of 4.9% at a concentration of 32 nmol/L, 8.9%
at 77 nmol/L, and 17.4% at 213 nmol/L. These measurements are
within adequate limits for biochemical analyses (31, 32). The
Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme was used to
evaluate vitamin D testing (30). Children’s weight (in kilograms)
was divided by height (square meters) to determine BMI. zBMI is
based on the WHO growth standards, which represent optimal
children’s growth and are age- and sex-standardized measures of
adiposity in children (33–35). Height measurements were obtained
through use of a standardized length board for participants #2 y
and a stadiometer for those .2 y (SECA). A precision digital
scale was used to quantify weight (60.025%; SECA).
Biologically plausible factors that may affect the relation be-
tween milk-fat percentage and both serum 25(OH)D and zBMI
were determined a priori based on existing scientific data and used
as potential confounding variables. These factors included age,
sex, daily vitamin D supplementation, minutes per day of both
outdoor free play and screen time, milk volume (in 250-mL cups)
consumed daily, volume of sugar-sweetened beverages consumed
daily, maternal BMI (measured at clinic visit), skin pigmentation,
after-tax median neighborhood family income, maternal self-
reported ethnicity, and date of serum collection. Children con-
suming a vitamin D supplement and/or multivitamin each day were
considered to supplement daily with vitamin D. All Canadian
children’s supplements that contain vitamin D have 400 IU (10 mg)
as a daily dose (36). Daily outdoor free play was measured by the
question, “On a typical weekday, how much time does your child
spend outside in ‘unstructured free play’?” Daily screen time was
quantified with the question, “On a typical day, how many min-
utes did your child spend in a room with a TV, video games,
computer games, or handheld device games on?” Milk volume
and sugar-sweetened beverages consumed daily were quantified
by asking, “How many cups of each drink does your child have
currently in a typical day?” Trained personnel measured maternal
BMI at the time of child primary care visits by use of the standard
formula (33, 34). Skin pigmentation was evaluated with the
Fitzpatrick scale, which is commonly used in dermatological re-
search (37, 38). We determined after-tax median neighborhood
family income by collecting postal codes and using the Postal
Code Conversion File from Statistics Canada, which used the
2011 census of Canada (39). Maternal ethnicity was classified
into 1 of 6 geography-based categories (40).
Statistical analysis
To examine the association between milk-fat percentage (primary
exposure) and the 2 primary outcomes, serum 25(OH)D and zBMI,
we used bivariate multivariable linear regression, which allowed
modeling of 2 simultaneously occurring outcomes in each individual.
This method is ideal when the 2 outcomes may be correlated; should
this prove true, statistical power is maximized (41). This model was
adjusted for sociodemographic, dietary, and environmental covariates
determined a priori (listed above), all of which remained in the model
irrespective of statistical significance, to eliminate incorrect SEs and
biased R2 values (42). To make a clinically relevant comparison, we
compared the bivariate outcomes in children who consumed whole
milk (3.25%) to those in children who consumed 1% milk [a small
proportion of children within the sample consumed skim (0.1% fat)
milk] using bivariate logistic regression. Residual plot examination
of 25(OH)D revealed a positive skew, which normalized with log
transformation. Date values were manipulated by use of a sinusoi-
dal function to adjust for the seasonal influence on 25(OH)D.
For the secondary analysis, an interaction term tested at the
a = 0.05 significance level, between-volume and fat percentage of
milk each child drank were added to the primary model to explore
possible effect modification by the milk volume consumed. Multi-
collinearity was evaluated through use of the variance inflation
factor; the variance inflation factor of all covariates remained under
2 (43). Because data were expected to be missing at random,
multiple imputation was used to reduce bias from performing
complete case analysis; none of the variables had .11% missing
data. Fifty data sets were computer generated and the results were
recombined (42, 44). All of the analyses were completed by use of
R version 3.1.1 (R Foundation) (45). The research ethics boards of
The Hospital for Sick Kids and St. Michael’s Hospital approved this
study, and permission was obtained from every parent or guardian.
RESULTS
Of the 5301 children in TARGet Kids!, 2745 had venous blood
samples taken and underwent 25(OH)D testing (Figure 1). Participants
eligible and ineligible for the study were clinically alike (Table 1).
The mean age was 2.8 y, and 53% were boys. The mean serum

 25(OH)D concentration was 87 nmol/L, and the mean zBMI was
0.2 (SD 1.0). The mean daily milk consumption was 2.1 cups (1 cup =
250 mL)/child, and 56% of participants took a daily vitamin D
supplement. Forty-nine percent of the children drank whole milk
(3.25% fat); 35% consumed 2% milk, 12% drank 1% milk, and 4%
consumed skim milk (0.1% fat). More than one type of milk was
consumed by 122 children; the milk-fat percentage was averaged for
these subjects. Overweight children (zBMI .1) constituted 21% of
the sample and 5% were obese (zBMI .2) (46). A total of 38% of
children had a serum 25(OH)D concentration ,75 nmol/L, whereas
5.9% had a serum 25(OH)D concentration ,50 nmol/L (47, 48).
Regression results are shown in Table 2 and Figure 2. In the
bivariate linear regression model, adjusted for clinically relevant
potential confounders, there was a positive relation between
milk-fat percentage and 25(OH)D (P = 0.006) and a negative
relation between milk-fat percentage and zBMI (P , 0.0001).
Children’s median 25(OH)D was 1.67 nmol/L (95% CI: 1.01,
3.05) higher with every 1% increase in milk fat consumed. The
average child who consumed whole milk had a median 25(OH)D
concentration of 5.43 nmol/L (95% CI: 4.32, 6.54) higher than
a child who drank 1% milk. Furthermore, children had a 2.25-fold
lower odds (95% CI: 1.28, 3.99) of 25(OH)D ,50 nmol/L if they
drank whole milk compared to those who drank 1% milk. As
Table 2 shows, higher milk volume consumption and vitamin D
supplements taken daily both were positively related to 25(OH)D

For the secondary analysis, we evaluated whether the volume
of milk that children drank modified the relation between milk-fat

tion term between volume and milk-fat percentage consumed

25(OH)D that was comparable to children who consumed 2.9
cups 1% milk/d (95% CI: 2.85, 3.04 cups 1% milk/d) but had
a zBMI score 0.79 U (95% CI: 0.64, 0.94 U) lower.
DISCUSSION
We have described a relation between milk-fat percentage and
both 25(OH)D and zBMI during early childhood. Those who
consumed whole milk (3.25% fat) had a median serum 25(OH)D
5.4 nmol/L higher than those who consumed 1% milk, which is
a similar change in 25(OH)D as 1 additional cup milk/d (27).
Children who drank a given volume of whole milk also had
a 0.72-U lower zBMI score (equivalent to a 0.9 lower BMI in a
3-y-old boy) than children who drank 1% milk, which is com-
parable to the difference between healthy weight and overweight
(49). Interventions for childhood obesity have considered a 0.5
change in zBMI to be meaningful, suggesting that the magnitude
of this association may be clinically important (50, 51). It also
appeared that milk-fat percentage modified the association be-
tween milk volume consumed and 25(OH)D but not zBMI. When
analyzing the outcomes associated with either 1% milk or whole
milk (3.25% fat), participants who drank 1 cup whole milk/d had
a 25(OH)D concentration comparable to participants who drank
2.9 cups 1% milk/d but a 0.79-U lower zBMI.
Suggestions made by the National Institutes of Health, Health
Canada, and the American Academy of Pediatrics state that
people .2 y should drink 2 servings/d of reduced fat milk (1%
or 2%) to reduce fat in their diet. Our findings raise the possi-
bility that this recommendation may paradoxically decrease
children’s vitamin D status and increase their adiposity, which
may not be desirable outcomes. Several mechanisms have been
described, which may explain our findings. The positive asso-
ciation observed between milk fat and serum 25(OH)D could be
attributed to increased intestinal absorption of vitamin D be-
cause of its fat solubility (26). This was observed in our previous
analysis on a similar cohort of children, which did not analyze
zBMI as a simultaneous outcome as the current study did (25).
Alternatively, this positive association may be a reflection of
children’s adiposity, because adiposity and vitamin D stores
have an inverse relation in children (18–24, 52). The negative
association between milk-fat consumption and adiposity may be
the result of heightened satiety following higher milk-fat con-
sumption, thus reducing total caloric intake as reported by others
(14, 17). Alternatively, a reverse-causality scenario may exist
in which overweight children transition to lower-fat milk to
reduce further gains in adiposity (14). The degree of adiposity
in overweight or obese children may be underestimated by
parents, however; thus they may not intervene (53).
Our findings raise the possibility that reduced-fat milk may
compromise both serum 25(OH)D and zBMI. Should these re-
lations prove to be causal, young children may benefit from
consuming higher fat content milk (i.e., whole milk) rather than
low fat milk (1% or skim) to maximize vitamin D stores and
minimize risk of overweight (13–17). Because both vitamin D
status and adiposity have a substantial impact on children’s
growth and development, these findings may have important
implications for health maintenance at a population level.
The strengths of our analysis include a broad, healthy, cul-
turally diverse cohort of young children with data on milk
consumption, vitamin D status, and adiposity. In addition, the
sample size allowed sufficient power to conduct the proposed
analysis. Simulations reveal that the sample size required to have
80% power to detect associations of the observed magnitude
was w200 children; therefore, 2745 children were sufficient to
control for a broad range of potential confounders with the
available clinical data. Furthermore, the analytic approach al-
lowed modeling both 25(OH)D and zBMI as simultaneous
outcomes, which coexist in children.
The limitations of our analysis include the study design; in
a cross-sectional analysis, causality and its direction cannot be
established between the exposure and outcomes. Data collection
for milk consumption was by parent report, which may be subject
to recall bias. Potential additional sources of dietary vitamin D
were not accounted for in this study; however, cow milk has been
identified as the main dietary source of vitamin D in children in
North America (3–5). Other sources were considered to con-
tribute a negligible amount of vitamin D to children’s diets. Our
population of healthy urban North American children may not
be representative of all urban children; specifically, 56% regu-
larly consumed a vitamin D–containing supplement.
The present guidelines for reduced milk-fat consumption in
children .2 y are intended to decrease the risk of childhood obe-
sity, but they may have the paradoxical effect of limiting 25(OH)D
concentration and increasing adiposity. If these findings prove
causal, then consumption of milk with higher fat content may
be helpful in optimizing both vitamin D stores and adiposity.
Longitudinal and intervention studies are needed to confirm
these findings and examine clinical outcomes related to both
serum 25(OH)D concentrations and adiposity in children.
