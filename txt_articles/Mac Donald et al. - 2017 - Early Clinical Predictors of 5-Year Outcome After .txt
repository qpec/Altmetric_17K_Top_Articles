IMPORTANCE The long-term clinical effects of wartime traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), most of
which are mild, remain incompletely described. Current medical disability cost estimates from
world conflicts continually surpass projections. Additional information regarding long-term
functional trajectory is needed to reduce this extensive public health burden.
OBJECTIVES To examine 5-year clinical outcomes leveraging existing clinical data collected at
1 year after injury in the same patients and to identify early risk factors for long-term disability.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective, longitudinal study enrolled
active-duty US military after concussive blast injury (n = 50) in the acute to subacute stage
and combat-deployed control individuals (n = 44) in Afghanistan or after medical evacuation
to Germany from November 1, 2008, through July 1, 2013. One- and 5-year clinical
evaluations were completed in the United States. All concussive blast injuries met the
Department of Defense definition of mild, uncomplicated TBI. In-person clinical evaluations
included standardized evaluations for neurobehavior, neuropsychological performance, and
mental health burden that were essentially identical to the evaluations completed at 1-year
follow-up. Data were analyzed from October 1 through November 30, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Changes in the in-person standardized evaluations for
neurobehavior, neuropsychological performance, and mental health burden from the 1- to
5-year follow-up. Predictive modeling was used to identify early risk factors for long-term
disability.
RESULTS Among the 94 participants (87 men [93%] and 7 women [7%]; mean [SD] age, 34
[8] years), global disability, satisfaction with life, neurobehavioral symptom severity,
psychiatric symptom severity, and sleep impairment were significantly worse in patients with
concussive blast TBI compared with combat-deployed controls, whereas performance on
cognitive measures was no different between groups at the 5-year evaluation. Logistic
regression on the dichotomized Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) at 5 years as a
measure of overall disability identified brain injury diagnosis, preinjury intelligence, motor
strength, verbal fluency, and neurobehavioral symptom severity at 1 year as risk factors for a
poor outcome at 5 years, with an area under the curve of 0.92 indicating excellent prediction
strength. Thirty-six of 50 patients with concussive blast TBI (72%) had a decline in the GOS-E
from the 1- to 5-year evaluations, in contrast with only 5 of 44 combat-deployed controls
(11%). Worsening of symptoms in concussive blast TBI was also observed on measures of
posttraumatic stress disorder and depression. Service members with concussive blast TBI
experienced evolution, not resolution, of symptoms from the 1- to 5-year outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Considerable decline was observed in military service
members with concussive blast TBI when comparing 1- and 5-year clinical outcomes. These
results advocate for new treatment strategies to combat the long-term and extremely costly
effect of these wartime injuries.

 T
raumatic brain injury (TBI) affects roughly 3.5 million
individuals annually in the United States,1 and approxi-
mately 75% of TBIs are attributable to mild or concus-
sive events.2 An estimated 20% of the deployed US military
suffered a head injury in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan3;
83.3% endured a mild, uncomplicated TBI or concussion.4-6
Comparedwithcivilians,servicememberswithTBIhaveahigh
rate of comorbid mental health conditions. Previous studies7
found that 89% of veterans diagnosed with TBI also had a psy-
chiatric diagnosis, with the median cost of health care in these
comorbid cases being 4 times that of veterans with psychiat-
ric diagnosis without TBI. Although civilian studies8 have re-
portedpooroutcomesontheExtendedGlasgowOutcomeScale
(GOS-E)in22%to33%ofpatientswithmildTBI,reportsofmild
TBI sustained in combat have identified 62% to 96% with poor
outcomes on the same measure.9-12
The long-term clinical effects of wartime injuries remain
incompletely described.13,14 Previous studies15-18 have been
based largely on self-report and screening tools to define TBI,
rather than direct clinical assessments in cohorts identified at
the time of injury and prospectively studied. Although much
efforthasbeenexpendedtobetterunderstandthistypeofcon-
cussive TBI, many studies in active-duty US military and
veterans16,19-26 have been restricted to cross-sectional evalu-
ations,ofteninvolvingretrospectivemedicalrecordreview19-21
or self-report16,18,22-24,26,27 and considering only later stages
of injury.25,28
In contrast, our group was provided the unique opportu-
nitytoexaminepatientsintheacute9,29tosubacute10-12,30stage
after combat-related concussive TBI with prospective fol-
low-up to 1-year9-12,30 and now 5-year evaluations. This lon-
gitudinal observation has allowed for a greater appreciation
of functional postinjury trajectory and the effect on long-
term outcome. The present study objective was to examine
5-year clinical outcomes leveraged with existing early clini-
cal data in the same patients. Our goal was to identify predic-
tors of poor outcome in service members diagnosed with con-
cussive blast TBI. Given the extraordinary effect of these
wartime injuries on service members, their families, commu-
nities, and the health care delivery system, we have an im-
perative to determine factors that will aid in identifying those
at risk to better target treatments and therapies, providing pro-
active resolutions to this potentially high-cost and lifelong
health burden.
Methods
Participants were originally enrolled in 1 of 4 previous
cohorts.9-12,29,30 The present study is the 5-year evaluation in
a continued prospective, observational, longitudinal re-
search study. We report the 5-year clinical outcomes com-
pared with 1-year findings in the following participant groups:
patients with concussive blast TBI and combat-deployed con-
trol individuals. This study was approved by the institutional
reviewboardsoftheUniversityofWashington,Seattle,andthe
US Army Medical Research Materiel Command and was per-
formed in accordance with the approved protocol. All partici-
pants provided additional written informed consent for the
5-yearevaluation;nosurrogateconsentwasallowed(eMethods
in the Supplement).
Selection and enrollment for the 5-year evaluation
focused on individuals who had been enrolled at the time of
injury, completed the 1-year evaluation, and were at a mini-
mum of 4 years past the original enrollment. Inclusion crite-
ria are reported elsewhere.9,10,30 In brief, participants were
service members deployed to combat from November 1, 2008,
through July 1, 2013, for whom original enrollment was
completed directly in Afghanistan9,29 or after medical evacu-
ation to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Landstuhl,
Germany.10-12,30 Diagnosis of head injury was determined by
trained medical personnel working in the TBI clinics in Ger-
many. For the concussive blast TBI group, all available clini-
cal histories indicated blast exposure plus another mecha-
nism of head injury, such as a fall, motor vehicle crash, or being
struck by a blunt object. All patients with concussive blast TBI
were evacuated to Germany, and their cases met the Depart-
ment of Defense definition of mild, uncomplicated TBI. None
had a prior TBI or psychiatric diagnosis in their medical rec-
ords. All combat-deployed controls were found in clinical
evaluation to be free of TBI signs and symptoms, and we re-
viewed their medical records to confirm no history of TBI di-
agnosis, psychiatric diagnosis, or blast exposure. Combat-
deployedcontrolswereenrolleddirectlyinAfghanistanorafter
evacuation to Germany for noncombat diagnoses such as gas-
trointestinal tract issues or dermatitis. Subgroup analysis by
evacuation status in the control group identified no differ-
ences in any of the clinical outcome measures,10 and the data
were combined for this study.
Clinical Assessments
In-person clinical evaluations at the University of Washing-
ton included a structured neurobehavioral interview, neuro-
psychologicalbatteryconsistingof10cognitivetests,andstruc-
tured psychiatric evaluation identical to the 1-year follow-up
with additional self-administered questionnaires. Evalua-
tions lasted approximately 5 hours, including 1 hour of stan-
dardized neurologic examination and 2 hours each for cogni-
tive testing and psychiatric evaluation. Participants took all
Key Points
Questions What early clinical variables are best associated with
long-term outcome after concussive blast injury, and do patients
experience symptom resolution?
Findings In this longitudinal case-control study of military service
members, brain injury diagnosis, preinjury intelligence, motor
strength, verbal fluency, and neurobehavioral symptom severity at
1 year were most associated with 5-year global outcome. Thirty-six
of 50 patients with blast concussion experienced a decline from
the 1- to 5-year evaluations.
Meaning Considerable decline was observed in service members
with concussive blast injury, supporting the need for new
treatment strategies to combat the long-term and extremely
costly effects of these wartime injuries.

 medications as prescribed by their clinical health care profes-
sionals. All tests were performed from 8 AM to 5 PM in private,
quiet, well-lighted rooms. All examiners were blinded to other
clinical information, although during the interviews, partici-
pant group often became clear in given endorsements of prior
events. All examiners were psychometrists who underwent
standardized training for administration.
Overall global disability was assessed using the GOS-E.31,32
Poor outcome was defined as a GOS-E score of 6 or less, indi-
cating moderate to severe disability. Additional information
on the GOS-E and for neuropsychological battery details can
be found in the eMethods in the Supplement.
The neurologic assessment included a structured inter-
view designed for patients with TBI (Neurobehavioral Rating
Scale–Revised33), 2 headache interviews capturing fre-
quency and intensity (Migraine Disability Assessment34 and
the 6-item Headache Impact Test35), the Neurological Out-
come Scale for Traumatic Brain Injury36-38 designed to assess
focal neurologic deficits associated with TBI, and a TBI his-
tory intake interview modified from the Brain Injury Screen-
ing Questionnaire39 to confirm life history of head injury ex-
posure and identify new head injuries sustained since the last
evaluation. Participants completed the Quality of Life After
Brain Injury40,41 questionnaire capturing life satisfaction.
The psychiatric evaluation included structured inter-
views and self-administered questionnaires. The Clinician-
Administered PTSD (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) Scale for
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth
Edition (CAPS)42 and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating
Scale (MADRS)43 for depression were administered as struc-
tured interviews before the participant completed the PTSD
Checklist–Military Version,44 Beck Depression Inventory,45
anxiety module of the Brief Symptom Inventory,46 Insomnia
Severity Index,47 and Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test.48
The CAPS was scored using the rules from Blake et al.49
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from October 1 through November 30,
2016. Group differences in patient characteristics were as-
sessed using the 2-sided Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney U
tests as appropriate. Group differences in the 5-year outcome
were evaluated using standard linear and logistic regression
with adjustment for imbalances in patient characteristics. Ex-
tension of the 5-year outcome analyses to adjust for the cor-
responding 1-year outcome was performed using linear and lo-
gistic mixed-effects regression modeling, with random
intercepts and slopes for each participant and an unstruc-
tured correlation matrix. Risk factors for a poor 5-year out-
come were determined using multivariate logistic regression
modeling based on TBI diagnosis, demographic characteris-
tics, and 1-year clinical outcome data using the Akaike infor-
mation criterion50 to determine the optimal combination of
variables.ThenumberofeventspervariableforthebestAkaike
information criterion model was 8, which although lower than
the minimum recommended number (10-15), is likely valid
given the conditions of this particular analysis.51 The area un-
der the receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated
to assess model predictive accuracy.
Results
In total, 94 service members completed the 5-year evalua-
tion, including 50 patients with concussive blast TBI and 44
combat-deployed controls (87 men [93%] and 7 women [7%];
mean [SD] age, 34 [8] years) (Table). General demographic de-
tails of participants, such as the numbers of officers vs en-
listed personnel and race/ethnicity, did not significantly
differ across groups. Combat-deployed controls were slightly
older (mean [SD] age, 35 [8] vs 32 [8] years; P = .02, 2-sided
Mann-Whitney U test), included more women (6 [14%] vs 1
[2%];P = .048,Fisherexacttest),hadahighereducationallevel
(mean [SD], 15.0 [2.5] vs 13.0 [1.5] years; P = .001, 2-sided
Mann-Whitney U test), and included fewer members of the US
Army (30 [68%] vs 45 [90%]; P = .01, Fisher exact test), com-
pared with patients with concussive blast TBI. All results were
adjusted by age, educational level, sex, rank, branch of ser-
vice, and race/ethnicity. All cross-sectional associations be-
tween measures were adjusted for these factors by fitting lin-
ear (continuous) and logistic (binary) regression models, and
adjusted P values are reported. When comparing the number
of service members in each group who separated from the ser-
vice within the first 5 years, we found that 15 combat-
deployed controls (34%) and 37 patients with concussive blast
TBI (74%) had left the military (P < .001, Fisher exact test). Al-
though all 44 combat-deployed controls maintained employ-
ment, only 36 patients with concussive blast TBI (72%) were
employed (P < .001, Fisher exact test).
Global Outcome
Patients with concussive blast TBI fared worse on global out-
come measures as evidenced by the GOS-E and the Quality of
Life After Brain Injury questionnaire at the 5-year follow-up
(bothadjustedP < .001)(Figure1).GoodoutcomefortheGOS-E
was defined as a score of 7 or 8, with 6 or lower considered to
be a poor outcome. Five combat-deployed controls (11%) met
this criterion, whereas 36 patients with concussive blast TBI
(72%)werefoundtoalsohavepooroutcomes(Figure1A).Com-
paring 1-year with 5-year GOS-E scores in the same partici-
pant, 5 combat-deployed controls (11%) had experienced de-
cline by their 5-year evaluation. In contrast, 36 patients who
experienced concussive blast TBI (72%) declined into or fur-
ther in the moderate to severe disability range. A small subset
ineachcohort(10patientswithconcussiveblastTBI[20%]and
15 combat-deployed controls [34%]) improved, defined as a
1-year GOS-E score of 6 or less and a 5-year GOS-E score of 7 or
8. Many participants reported a significant effect on quality of
life as observed in Figure 1B; 6 combat-deployed controls (14%)
and 23 patients with concussive blast TBI (46%) scored in the
bottom 3 categories of no to moderate life satisfaction (ad-
justed P < .001).
Neurobehavioral Evaluation
The patients with concussive blast TBI had significantly el-
evated levels of neurobehavioral symptoms (unadjusted mean
[SD], 5 [4]) compared with combat-deployed controls at their
5-year evaluation (unadjusted mean [SD], 14 [7]; adjusted

neurologic deficits, evidenced by the Neurological Outcomes
ScaleforTraumaticBrainInjury(unadjustedmean[SD],1.1[1.4]
for controls vs 1.6 [1.5] for the TBI group; adjusted P = .53)
(Figure 2B). Headache impairment was worse in the concus-
sive blast TBI group (adjusted P < .001) (Figure 2C). With use
of the clinical cutoff of 11 for Migraine Disability Assessment
scores and 50 for Headache Impact Test scores, moderate to
severe headache impairment was observed in 10 combat-
deployed controls (23%) and 31 patients with concussive blast
TBI(62%)ontheMigraineDisabilityAssessmentandin19com-
bat-deployed controls (43%) and 43 patients with concussive
blast TBI (86%) on the Headache Impact Test. No participant
reported a TBI diagnosis since the 1-year evaluation on the his-
tory of head injury in the intake interview. Seven combat-
deployed controls (16%) and 27 patients with concussive blast
TBI (54%) endorsed events suggestive of concussion, al-
though few sought medical attention. These events were pri-
marily ground-level falls and hits to the head during training
exercises for combat-deployed controls and fights and motor
vehicle crashes for patients with concussive blast TBI.

tion (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Compared with combat-

P = .05), and verbal fluency (Controlled Oral Word Associa-
tion mean [SD] total score, 46.11 [10.67] vs 40.66 [9.62]; ad-
justed P = .04). None of the differences remained statisti-
cally significant after correction for multiple comparisons
(ie, P < .002).
Psychiatric Evaluation
Mental health symptoms in multiple domains were signifi-
cantly elevated in patients with concussive blast TBI com-
pared with combat-deployed controls at the 5-year evalua-
tion. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress measured by
structured interview (CAPS) and self-report (PTSD Checklist–
Military Version) were significantly more severe in patients
with concussive blast TBI (adjusted P < .001 for both)
(Figure 3A). Severity of depressive symptoms measured by
structured interview (MADRS) and self-report (Beck Depres-
sion Inventory) was similarly disparate across groups (ad-
justed P = .001 for both) (Figure 3B). Using the clinical cut-
offs of 65 for CAPS and 20 for MADRS, we found that 4
combat-deployed controls (9%) met the criteria for moderate
to severe PTSD and 6 (14%) for moderate to severe depres-
sion. In contrast, 24 patients with concussive blast TBI (48%)
had moderate to severe PTSD and 20 (40%) had moderate to
severe depression. When comparing the 1- and 5-year PTSD
data in the same participant, 9 combat-deployed controls
(21%) and 19 patients with concussive blast TBI (38%) scored
more than 10 points worse on the CAPS at their second
evaluation. Both groups had roughly 20% with substantial
exacerbation in depression defined as greater than a
10-point increase on the MADRS during this period (8
combat-deployed controls [18%] and 10 patients with con-
cussive blast TBI [20%]).
The groups also significantly differed on measures of anxi-
ety (adjusted P = .001) and sleep impairment (adjusted
P = .003), whereas no significant difference was observed in
alcohol misuse (adjusted P = .23) (Figure 3C-E). Using the clini-
cal cutoffs of 7 for the anxiety module of the Brief Symptom
Inventory and 15 for the Insomnia Severity Index (sleep im-
pairment measure), 6 combat-deployed controls (14%) and 27
patients with concussive blast TBI (54%) had moderate to se-
vereanxietysymptoms,and9combat-deployedcontrols(20%)
and 28 patients with concussive blast TBI (56%) had moder-
ate to severe sleep impairment. Of interest, between the 1- and
5-year study evaluations, 18 combat-deployed controls (41%)
and40patientswithconcussiveblastTBI(80%)endorsedseek-
ing assistance from a licensed mental health care profes-
sional, defined as a psychologist, psychiatrist, therapist, so-
cial worker, or other licensed, credentialed mental health care
professional. Only 9 combat-deployed controls (20%) and 9

tal health programs helped.

 (preinjury intelligence measure),52 and performance on
Controlled Oral Word Association (verbal fluency)53
(Figure 4 and eTable 2 in the Supplement), with an area
under the curve of 0.92. In the small subset showing
improvement, the best-fit model included control status,
younger age, and lower depression severity on the MADRS,
with an area under the curve of 0.88.
Discussion
These findings indicate that service members who sustained
blast concussion in combat have worse early long-term out-
comes compared with combat-deployed controls. The rate of
disability observed in concussive blast TBI is much higher than
inotherwisecomparablecivilianstudies,eveninmildTBIwith
polytrauma, and speaks to a higher percentage of persistent
postinjury symptoms in service personnel.54-61 A substantial
number of patients with concussive blast TBI continued to ex-
perience decline from the 1- to 5-year evaluations. The his-
toricmantrainmedicineregardinggeneralstabilityat6months
after injury appears to be challenged in this population, with
progression of postconcussive symptoms well after this time
frame.
Although cognitive performance was not substantially
different between patients with concussive blast TBI and com-
bat-deployed controls, considerable disparities in psychiatric
symptom severity were observed. Specifically, symptoms of
PTSD, depression, and anxiety were significantly elevated in
participants with concussive blast TBI, and a substantial num-
ber of these individuals were found to have worsening impair-
mentcomparedwiththeir1-yearassessment.Chronicsleepim-
pairment was also significantly worse in patients with
concussive blast TBI. We find the combination of sustained,
elevated psychiatric symptoms and sleep impairment con-
cerning, given the growing literature on the long-term health
implications of these 2 conditions. Chronic sleep impairment
hasbeenreportedtoaffectmetabolicandcardiovascularhealth
as well as overall disease-associated mortality.62 Although our
studyidentifiedimpairmentsustainedduringthecourseofthis
first 5-year period after injury, given the young age of these ser-
vicemembers(mostintheir30s),questionsariseregardinghow
these individuals will progress with natural aging and what
health complications they will face in the future.
For this reason, we examined predictors of the 5-year out-
come leveraging early clinical data collected in the same
participant to target modifiable risk factors to reduce the long-
term effect of these exposures. By logistic regression, we iden-
tifiedTBIdiagnosis,preinjuryintelligence,motorstrength,ver-
bal fluency, and neurobehavioral symptom severity at 1 year
as risk factors for 5-year poor outcomes, with an area under
the curve of 0.92 indicating excellent prediction strength.
Among these, neurobehavioral symptoms may be a particu-
larly important modifiable target for early intervention in ser-
vice members with concussion.63
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of this study include the use of a prospective, ob-
servational, longitudinal cohort design; enrollment of all com-
bat-deployed, active-duty US military in the acute9,29 to
subacute11,12,30phaseafterinjury;repeatedassessmentbyiden-
tical clinical measures at the 1- and 5-year evaluations; and
blinded clinical evaluations completed by trained personnel
at each point. Limitations include a modest sample size by
group, lack of comprehensive preinjury and acute postinjury
clinical data for comparison with later outcomes, heteroge-
neous treatment across centers and in the United States after
injury, and possible unmeasured covariates that may influ-
ence results.
Conclusions
Together these findings indicate progression of symptom
severity beyond 1 year after injury. Many service members
with concussive blast TBI experience evolution rather than
resolution of symptoms from the 1- to 5-year outcomes.
Even a small percentage of combat-deployed controls
appeared to experience worsening over time. In both
groups, this finding appears to be driven more by psychiat-
ric symptoms than by cognitive deficits. Efforts are under
way to replicate these findings in a larger cohort and to
extend evaluation to later years.
These results speak to the need for new approaches to co-
morbid mental health treatment and long-term care, given
that most of the patients in our study (80%) sought help but
a much smaller number (19%) found sustained resolution.
