Abstract
OBJECTIVE: To summarize the literature about the
effectiveness of dry needling (DN) on relieving pain
and increasing range of motion (ROM) in individu-
als with myofascial pain syndrome (MPS).
METHODS: Papers published from January 2000 to
January 2013 were identified through an electronic
search in the databases MEDLINE, Dialnet, Co-
chrane Library Plus, Physiotherapy Evidence Data-
base (PEDro) and Spanish Superior Council of Scien-
tific Research (CSIC). The studies included were ran-
domized controlled trials written in English and/or
Spanish about the effectiveness of DN on pain and
ROM in individuals with MPS.
RESULTS: Out of 19 clinical trials that were poten-
tially relevant, a total of 10 were included in the Me-
ta-analysis. Regarding pain intensity reduction
when measured before and immediately after the
intervention, DN achieved improvement compared
with the placebo treatment [d = －0.49; 95% CI (－
3.21, 0.42)] and with the control group [d = －9.13;
95% CI (－ 14.70, － 3.56)]. However, other treat-
ments achieved better results on the same variable
compared with DN, considering the measurements
for pre-treatment and immediately after [d = 2.54;
95% CI (－0.40, 5.48)], as well as the pre-treatment
and after 3-4 weeks [d = 4.23; 95% CI (0.78, 7.68)].
DN showed a significantly increased ROM when
measured before the intervention and immediately
after, in comparison with the placebo [d = 2.00;
95% CI (1.60, 2.41)]. However, other treatments
achieved a significant better result regarding ROM
when it was measured before the intervention and
immediately after, as compared with DN [d = －1.42;
95% CI (－1.84, －0.99)].
CONCLUSION: DN was less effective on decreasing
pain comparing to the placebo group. Other treat-
ments were more effective than DN on reducing
pain after 3-4 weeks. However, on increasing ROM,
DN was more effective comparing to that of place-
bo group, but less than other treatments.

INTRODUCTION
Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is one of the most
frequent causes of musculoskeletal chronic pain. Myo-

Rodríguez-Mansilla J et al. / Systematic Review
fascial trigger point (MTP) causes MPS due to the pres-
ence of hypersensitive nodules.
1,2
The MTP is a hyperirritable structure located in the
tense band of a muscle. After its stimulation, the MTP
is responsible for referred pain (outside the area of the
MTP) and unspecific pain with a variable severity.
These points are of unknown etiology and they are
characterized by a motor alteration (resistant muscular
band) and a sensitive alteration (numbness and re-
ferred pain).
1
The most accepted theory regarding to the nature of
the MTP, known as integrated hypothesis, was de-
scribed by Simons
2 in 1996 and subsequently expand-
ed
3 and updated.
4 Although it needs to be fully consoli-
dated through experimentation, it provides answers to
questions regarding what MTP is, where they are locat-
ed and what would be the best approaches for their
management.
5
According to this theory, the MTP constitute a neuro-
muscular pathology initiated by a pre-synaptic dysfunc-
tion of the motor plate characterized by an excessive re-
lease of acetylcholine (ACh) in the synaptic cleft that
causes a localized contracture of the sarcomere closest
to the motor plate. This contracture would cause the
increase of tension in the affected fibre, hypoxia due to
the vascular compression and accumulation of sensitiz-
ing substances which are responsible for the hyperalge-
sia of the MTP and a poor level of acetyl cholinester-
ase. This deficit could mean a synaptic dysfunction
that would add to the presynaptic problem of the ex-
cess release of ACh and to any possible postsynaptic
conflict related to the amount of ACh receptors or
their sensitivity. All this would close the cycle and
would explain the capacity of the MTP to self-perpetu-
ate, as there are mechanisms that could continue the al-
terations even if the initial presynaptic dysfunction
would resolve.
5
The main characteristic of MTPs is that they cause re-
ferred pain with a specific pattern for each muscle,
what favours the treatment approach through local in-
terventions. Besides, this symptomatology is repro-
duced when pressure is being applied on that point
and they are activated with overpressure, trauma,
mood and/or reflex causes.
6
There are many treatment techniques for the manage-
ment of MTP and they include conservative and inva-
sive techniques. Scientific evidence shows that conser-
vative techniques are the most applied treatments for
this syndrome, including physical therapy,
7,8 stretching,
massage and electrotherapy.
9 However, invasive tech-
niques, such as botulin toxin injections,
10 acupuncture,
11 electroacupunture
12 and dry needling (DN), have
been introduced recently.
One of the newest therapies used to treat MPS is DN.
It is performed by inserting a needle at the MTP at
subcutaneous or muscle level. The mechanic stimulus
of the needle is used as a physical agent to remove the
MTP without injection or extraction of any substance
and causing a local spasm response.
5 The needling does
not stay in place and it is removed once the MTP has
been deactivated.
13 After its deactivation, etiological
and disturbing factors of the MTP must be controlled
to avoid relapses.
5,13 The dry needling action mecha-
nism is based on the gate control theory of pain devel-
oped by Furlan et al.
13 DN causes the inhibition of the
C fibers that carry the MTP pain impulses. This inhibi-
tion is due to the activation of the A-delta fibers when
the needle perforates the skin and to the relaxation of
the tense MTP muscle band.
Recent investigations showed on conclusive results on
the effectiveness of DN to manage MTP. The system-
atic review carried out by Cummings et al
14 in 2001
and other studies, such as the one from Kietrys et al
15
in 2013, can be found in the literature. Despite con-
cluding that DN decreased pain immediately after its
application when comparing with sham needle or pla-
cebo, their search was only done in very few databases.
In addition, Tough et al
16 published a systematic re-
view in 2009, where DN was compared with acupunc-
ture, standardized care and placebo.
We summarized the literature about the effectiveness
of dry needling on decreasing pain and increasing
range of motion (ROM) in individuals with MPS.
METHODS
Search strategy
This study is a systematic review of randomized con-
trolled trails. The eligibility criteria were: articles pub-
lished from January 2000 to January 2013, written in
English and Spanish and studies where interventions
were applied on patients with MPS, whatever their lo-
cation, intensity and duration and based on treatments
with the DN technique.
The electronic databases MEDLINE, Dialnet, Co-
chrane Library Plus, "The Physiotherapy Evidence Da-
tabase" PEDro and CSIC (IME, ISOC) were used. In
MEDLINE, "The Physiotherapy Evidence Database"
PEDro, Cochrane Library Plus and CSIC databases,
the same key words used were: "Dry needling AND
myofascial pain syndromes AND Physiotherapy", "dry
needling AND trigger points", "myofascial pain syn-
drome AND trigger points AND physiotherapy". In
Dialnet, the following Spanish key words were used:
"punción seca y dolor miofascial" (Dry needling AND
myofascial pain), "Punción seca y puntos gatillo" (dry
needling AND trigger points), "Síndrome de dolor
miofascial y puntos gatillo y fisioterapia" (myofascial
pain syndrome AND trigger points AND physiothera-
py).
Afterwards, a manual search was done on all relevant
journals available to the research group, which were
not indexed on the searched electronic databases.
These included publications in all the pre-indexed is-
sues of Acupuncture in Medicine and Revista Interna-

cional de Acupuntura, and in the research group's own
files (excluding un-published studies).
Study selection and data extraction
Two independent reviewers (Juan Rodríguez Mansilla
and Blanca González Sánchez) did the search and anal-
ysed the articles found. In case of disagreement, data
sharing was done concluding in consensus between
both reviewers. As a general rule, a pre-selection of the
papers was done considering if they were within the
proposed subject of the study. A selection of full arti-
cles was established followed by reading their abstract.
All those papers that did not meet the inclusion criteria
before mentioned were excluded. The studies that met
the inclusion criteria were read, analysed and included
in this systematic review.
The following data were extracted from the studies in-
cluded in the review: study design, objective of the
study, description of the intervention of control and ex-
perimental groups, follow up period and outcome mea-
sures. This data was compiled in a standard table (Ta-
ble 1). The data extraction and the risk of bias assess-
ment were done by the two reviewers independently.
The analysis of the methodological quality of the stud-
ies was done using the scale Physiotherapy Evidence
Database (PEDro)
17 which indicates the quality of clin-
ical trials. It is made of 11 criteria with 'yes' (Y) or 'no'
(N) reply and a total range of score of 0 to 10 accord-
ing to a low to excellent methodological quality.
The 11 criteria that were assessed with the PEDro scale
are: (a): Specificity of inclusion criteria; (b) Random al-
location; (c) Concealed allocation; (d) Baseline similari-
ty; (e) Blinding of participants; (f) Blinding of thera-
pists; (g) Blinding of assessor; (h) Measures of key out-
comes from at least 85% of the participants; (i) Inten-
tion to treat analysis; (j) Between-groups statistical anal-
ysis; (k) Point measures and measures of variability.
The results obtained in the scale were considered as:
high quality, if the score is over 5 (6-8: good, 9-10 ex-
cellent); moderate quality, if the score between 4 and 5
(fair quality study); low quality, if the score is under 4
(poor quality study).
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was carried out with the EPI-
DAT 3.1 programme (Galician Public Health General
Directorate, Galicia, Spain). The heterogeneity was de-
termined through the Dersimonian and Laird's test
with the Cochran's Q statistic. When homogeneity was
observed, a fixed effect model was used. In case of het-
erogeneity, a random effect model was used. This mod-
el considers the variability of the results due to the dif-
ferences between studies. For all cases, forest plots were
drawn. The forest plots show the differences observed
between the mean values of the two treatments that
were considered as well as the overall measure, includ-
ing all the corresponding confidence intervals. In addi-
tion, the publication bias was analysed thought the
Begg (Z statistic) and Egger (t statistic) tests.
Pain intensity and range of movement (ROM) were es-
tablished as primary outcome measures. A Meta-analy-
sis comparing the changes on the effect size was ap-
plied to each of the subgroups (post and pre interven-
tion) between DN and its alternative. Therefore, two
values were obtained: a value corresponding to the
changes achieved by DN (improvement or worsening)
and another value corresponding to the changes
achieved by other treatments. The difference between
these values was then analysed.
As they were continuous variables, the difference of
mean values and confidence intervals of 95% were
used. P < 0.5 was considered as significant level.
RESULTS
Once the characteristics of the studies identified were
analysed, a total of 9 studies
1,18-25 were excluded from
the Meta-analysis since they did not use the appropri-
ate measurements, the data was insufficient or they
were not comparable with other studies due to their na-
ture. The results and conclusions of those studies were
explained separately.
The process of identifying eligible studies is outlined in
Figure 1 and the characteristics of each study included
in the Meta-analysis are shown in Table 1. Out of 191
studies found in the search, 19 articles (which included
852 patients) were selected for the review based on the
inclusion and exclusion criteria previously described in
the Materials and Methods section. As explained in the
Methods section, the characteristics of the 19 studies
considered potentially relevant were analysed. Those
that did not have the appropriate outcome measures,
had not enough data or were not comparable to other
studies were excluded from the Meta-analysis. A total
of 9 studies were not included in this Meta-analysis.
1,
18-25 These papers were not include in the Meta-analysis
for the following reasons: they did not give any effect
size which made the analysis difficult; the necessary in-
formation for the Meta-analysis was not available (for
example, results were described but not supported with
numeric values); and it was not possible to compare
them with the rest of selected papers.
The 10 selected studies
6,11,26-33 were distributed in 7 sub-
groups of similar characteristics, intervention type and
period of the study. This allowed the establishment of
groups that were initially similar in order that the Me-
ta-analysis made sense. Some of the studies appeared in
more than one group and even more than once in the
same group when DN has been compared with more
than one alternative.
The pooled effect size of pain intensity and range of
movement (ROM) were calculated. Pain intensity was
measured through the visual analogue scale (VAS) with
scores between 0 (no pain) and 10 (the worst possible
pain). The ROM was measured with a goniometer. All
studies compared the application of DN with other
treatment approach, including control group (partici-

pants did not receive any treatment), placebo (partici-
pants received a treatment with no specific effect) and
other treatments. The studies presented observations of
the effect size at different moments that were differenti-
ated in two time frames: (a) progress of the effect size
measured before and immediately after the treatment
and (b) progress of the effect size measured before and
between 3 and 4 weeks after the treatment. The pooled
effect size was considered for all groups. There was no
need to standardize any measures as all studies present-
ed the same scale. However, it was not possible to com-
pare all the treatment techniques at each assessment as
not all studies did the measurements at the same mo-
ment of the study. In any case, the moment when the
measurement was done, it was considered for the classi-
fication of the studies into the groups.
The studies included in the 7 subgroups, their charac-
teristics and the results of the heterogeneity and publi-
cation bias tests are shown in Table 2. A, B, C and D
subgroups are heterogeneous and E, F and G are homo-
geneous. On the other hand, the publication bias analy-
sis showed no statistical evidence of bias in any of the
groups.
Pain intensity (VAS)
According to the forest plots (Figure 2), we can con-
clude that there is a better effect of the DN decreasing
the intensity of the pain measured before the interven-
tion and immediately after in comparison to the place-
bo treatment [95% CI (－3.21, 0.42)] and the control
group [95% CI (－14.70, －3.56)] (Groups A and B).
However, a better effect on pain intensity was achieved
by other treatments in contrast with DN when pre-
treatment and immediately after measurements were
considered [95% CI (－0.40, 5.48)], as well as pretreat-
ment and after 3-4 weeks [95% CI (0.78, 7.68)]
(Groups C and D). We can highlight that, in groups A
and C, the differences were not statistically significant
with 95% of confidence interval, although in group C
there was a statistically significant difference when con-
sidering 90% of confidence level [Group C, 95% CI
(0.07, 5.01)].
Range of movement
Figure 3 shows a significant better effect of DN increas-
ing ROM when measured before the intervention and
immediately after, in comparison with the placebo
[95% CI (1.60, 2.41)] (Group E). However, other
treatments
achieved
significant
improvements
in
ROM, when it was measured before the intervention
and immediately after when compared with DN [95%
CI (－1.84, －0.99)] (Group F).
The weighted estimate that group G obtained based on
the fixed effect model [95% CI (－0.45, 0.26)].
Studies not included in the Meta-analysis
The characteristics of each study are shown in Table 1.

Outcome
For motion-related pain, use of acupuncture
at non-local points reduced pain scores by
about a third (P=0.000 06) compared to
DN and sham. ROM: non-local acupunc-
ture was significantly superior both to Sham
(P=0.0001) and DN (P=0.008)
After intervention there were no significant
inter- EG1 and EG2.
At 3 weeks GE1 demonstrated significantly
improved SFMPQ versus CG (P=0.043)
and EG2 (P=0.011).
Decrease in pain at rest and activity in G3.
No significant differences at 6 months. La-
ser therapy can be useful to treat MPS due
to its non-invasive nature.
EG1, reported significantly less pain during
sleep and physiotherapy.
Pain pressure thresholds and PS significantly
improved in all three groups.
VAS significantly decreased in the EG2 and
EG1groups and did not significantly change
in the EG1.
Straight leg raise and hip internal rotation re-
mained unchanged in GE1 and GE2 at all
times.
VAS assessment of hamstring pain and tight-
ness and gluteal
tightness after running
showed improvements immediately after the
intervention in GE1 and GE2 (P=0.001),
which were maintained at 24 and 72 h.

Outcome
EG1 and EG2 improved resting and active
pain level (P<0.01). Pain threshold im-
proved more in EG1
(P=0.04).
EG2 resulted in more continuous subjective
pain reduction and improvements on the
GDS that EG1.
There was no difference in the l ROM im-
provement between two groups.
Both active and passive ROM of shoulder
internal rotation, and the pressure pain
threshold of myofascial trigger points on the
treated side, were significantly increased (P<
0.01).
Statistically, all three groups showed favor-
able results for the assessed requirements (P<

did the association of lidocaine with corti-
coid (EG3) present the best results and in-
gestion of rescue medication.
Patients in the study EG1 reported signi fi
cantly more reduction in pain (P=0.009).
There was no difference in the cervical
ROM improvement between two groups
(P =0.136).
There were statistically significant improve-

compared to pre-treatment results (P<0.05).
No significant differences were observed be-
tween the groups (P>0.05).

Objective
To test the hypothesis that dry needle
stimulation of a myofascial trigger point
(sensitive locus) evokes segmental anti-no-
ciceptive effects.
To investigate the remote effect of dry
needling on the irritability of a myofascial
trigger point in the upper trapezius
muscle.
To investigate the effects of dry needling
over active trigger points in the masseter
muscle in patients with TMD.
To assess the outcomes in patients who
have received dry needling treatments
and to identify predictors of pain and dis-
ability.
To compare the effects caused by a single
application of elbow manipulation, dry
needling and sham dry needling on PPT
on subjects MTP in the lateral epicondyle
musculature.
To assess the usefulness of deep dry nee-
dling in the treatment of
temporomandibular myofascial pain.
To test the hypothesis that dry needling
is more effective than sham dry needling
in the treatment of myofascial pain syn-
drome.

Outcome
Significant increases in PPT were observed
in test subjects (EG1) at 3 (P=0.002) and 5
(P=0.015)
min
post-needling,
compared
with control.
Immediately after dry needling in the exper-
imental group, the mean pain intensity was
significantly reduced, but the mean pressure
threshold and the mean range of motion of
cervical spine were significantly increased.
Subjects showed greater improvements in
all the outcomes when receiving the deep
dry needling compared to the sham dry nee-
dling (P<0.001).
The proposed dry-needling protocol re-
duced pain intensity and pain interference.
Long duration of pain, high pain intensity,
poor quality of sleep, and repetitive stress
were associated with poor outcomes.
Post-hoc tests showed a significant decrease
of the PPT (P=0.02) 10 min after the inter-
vention compared to the post-intervention
value for the manipulation group. It was
not possible to demonstrate that manipula-
tion or dry needling are superior to placebo
puncture in bene fi ts on pain, PPT and
handgrip strength.
ROM and VAS improvement in pain and
jaw movements, which continued up to 6
months after treatment (P<0.01).
When VAS scores were compared between
the groups, the first assessment scores were
found to be similar, but the second and
third assessment scores were found to be sig-
nificantly lower in the dry needling group
(P=00.034 and P<0.001, respectively).

the Meta-analysis. The intervention group that was
compared showed a better significant improvement
than the DN in the management of MPS.
18-22 However,
in the clinical trials where DN is not compared with
any other treatment technique but it is applied in an
isolated manner or compared with a placebo treat-
ment, a better effect in the improvement of pain was
observed.
1,23,24,34 In some cases, the improvement was on-
ly achieved after the needling and it was not main-
tained over time.
23
Methodological quality assessment
In relation to the methodological quality, the variables
were assessed with the rating "Y" or "N" according to
the presence or absence of the criteria studied. This is
shown in Table 3. Giving the score "N" means that
during the revision of the full article, that requirement
was not found in the main text but the lack of it can
not be guaranteed.
Two studies
1,34 were not assessed due to the lack of
control group. Out of the remaining 17 studies, the
scores varied from 8, good
24 to 2, poor quality.
22
The other studies obtained a score of 6-7 (good qual-
ity)
11,18,19,23,26,29-33 an 5-4 (fair quality).
6,20,21,27,28 All studies
did not have blinding of therapists who applied the
treatment (criteria No. 6) and only two of them
20,30
met the criteria No. 9, that is to say, the results of
all subjects who received treatment or were assigned
to the control group. Two studies
20,22 did not have a
random assignment which would guarantee the com-
parison of the intervention group versus the control
group.

Rodríguez-Mansilla J et al. / Systematic Review
DISCUSSION
As the evidence shows, MPS is one of the most treated
conditions in daily physical therapy clinical practice,
being MTP the cause of MPS.
1,2 Nowadays, many ther-
apy approaches are applied to treat this pathology with
the aim to improve its symptoms and DN is one of them.
However, due to the heterogeneity of the studies, the
limited number of interventions carried out (corticoste-
roids injections, continuous ultrasound therapy, etc),
the variability of the sample (N = 12, N = 40, N = 101,
N = 80, N = 50)
18,24,27,30,32 and the few studies included
in this review, it is difficult to confirm that DN is an ef-
fective treatment in the management of MPS.
In this way, the results obtained in this review study in-
dicate that there is an improvement of referred pain in-
tensity in patients after the treatment with DN if com-
pared with control group. These results coincide with
those from previous systematic reviews such as the stud-
ies of Kietrys et al
15 or Tough et al.
16 Nevertheless, it
was observed in this study that the improvement is
more evident with the use of other treatment tech-
niques versus DN when measured immediately after as
well as in the following assessments. In addition, we have
observed that this fact is repeated when the improvement
of ROM has been assessed. This aspect was not reflected
in previous systematic reviews as Tough et al.
16
In this regard, some studies that compared the effective-
ness of DN versus other treatments such as acupunc-
ture,
11 laser therapy,
23 lidocaine and corticoids injec-
tions
21 or ultrasound therapy and stretching
22 showed
better results than DN in relation to pain and cervical

spine ROM. In other studies where DN was compared
with a control group based on a simulated DN or pla-
cebo,
19,23,24,33 the results obtained were different. In
some studies the significant improvement of the pain is
similar in both control and DN groups.
19 In others, the
improvement was found to be statistically significant in
the experimental group.
23-31 In other studies, the first
measurements showed similar effects but there was a
decrease of pain in the experimental group after the
re-assessments.
33
Therefore, despite clinical practice showing that DN is
increasingly used nowadays and that this technique is
being applied with positive effects in rehabilitation
medicine, especially for the management of MPS, we
can observe that the scientific evidence observed in the
studies analysed do not have consistent results regard-
ing its effectiveness. In some papers, no significant dif-
ferences were seen in the improvement of MPS be-
tween the groups when DN was compared with a con-
trol group or a simulated DN group.
19 The comparison
of DN with other experimental groups showed that the
subjects treated with the alternative technique achieved
better results than those treated with DN.
11,21
Previous studies such as the systematic review carried
out by Tough et al
16 in 2009, which analysed the effec-
tiveness of acupuncture and dry needling in the treat-
ment of MTP
, observed that treatments applied with
needles compared with placebo did not show statistical
significance in pain improvement. They concluded
that further research in this field is needed as well as an
improvement of the scientific quality of the studies.
Currently, in 2013, the authors of this study still con-
sider the necessity that Tough et al
16 highlighted.
There are very few randomized controlled trials on this
subject, especially on MPS, which is the focus of this
review. Further studies are necessary in order to achieve
more reliable results and therefore progress on pain
management and ROM improvement and hence, the
quality of life of patients.
The conclusions of this study have been made based
on the articles identified through the search strategy se-
lected and according to the inclusion and exclusion cri-
teria established. However, the fact that there is the pos-
sibility that studies may not have been included in this
review due to indexing problems or search filters, must
be considered. Further randomized controlled trials are
needed in order to determine the effectiveness of this
technique in the management of MPS and consequent-
ly, recommend or not its use in physical therapy, as oth-
er treatment techniques have achieved better results than
DN improving pain and joint ROM in this condition.
Despite DN was more effective in decreasing pain
comparing to no treatment, it was not significantly
different from placebo in decreasing pain. Other
treatments were more effective than DN on decreas-
ing pain after 3-4 weeks. In increasing ROM DN
was more effective comparing to placebo, but less
than other treatments.
