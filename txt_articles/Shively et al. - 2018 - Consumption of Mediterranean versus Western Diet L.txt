In Brief
Using a non-human primate model of
women’s health, Shively et al.
demonstrate that diet plays a critical role
in determining microbiota populations in
tissues outside the gut, such as the
mammary gland. These microbial
populations modulate localized bile acid
and bacterial-modified metabolites to
potentially influence anticancer signaling
pathways.

SUMMARY
Recent identification of a mammary gland-spe-
cific microbiome led to studies investigating bac-
teria
populations
in
breast
cancer.
Malignant
breast tumors have lower Lactobacillus abundance
compared with benign lesions, implicating Lactoba-
cillus as a negative regulator of breast cancer. Diet
is a main determinant of gut microbial diversity.
Whether diet affects breast microbiome populations
is unknown. In a non-human primate model, we
found that consumption of a Western or Mediterra-
nean diet modulated mammary gland microbiota
and metabolite profiles. Mediterranean diet con-
sumption led to increased mammary gland Lactoba-
cillus abundance compared with Western diet-fed
monkeys. Moreover, mammary glands from Mediter-
ranean diet-fed monkeys had higher levels of bile
acid metabolites and increased bacterial-processed
bioactive compounds. These data suggest that

populations
outside the intestinal tract in distal sites such as the
mammary gland. Our study demonstrates that diet
affects the mammary gland microbiome, establish-
ing an alternative mechanistic pathway for breast
cancer prevention.
INTRODUCTION
Diet has been extensively studied as a modifiable component of
lifestyle that could influence breast cancer development. The
Mediterranean diet is considered to be one of the healthiest die-
tary habits (Willett et al., 1995). Mediterranean dietary patterns
are characterized by consumption of cereals (preferably as
whole grains), legumes, nuts, vegetables and fruits, fish or sea-
food, white meat and eggs, and moderate to small amounts of
poultry and dairy products. The principal source of dietary lipids
in the Mediterranean diet is olive oil.
It has been suggested that a Mediterranean dietary pattern
can protect against diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and can-
cer (Haegele et al., 1994; Pelucchi et al., 2009). Reported con-
sumption of a Mediterranean diet pattern was associated with
lower breast cancer risk for women with all subtypes of breast
cancer, and a Western diet pattern was associated with greater
risk (Castello
´ et al., 2014). Protective effects of Mediterranean
diet pattern on breast cancer risk were also observed in a recent
prospective cohort study (Buckland et al., 2013) and a random-
ized, single-blind, controlled field trial in which participants were
randomly allocated to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with
either extra-virgin olive oil or mixed nuts or a control diet and
advised to reduce dietary fat (Toledo et al., 2015). Associations
between dietary intake and cancer may not be ascribed to a sin-
gle nutrient but rather to multiple nutrients and foods and their
synergistic effects. Thus, assessing diet as a whole, on the basis
of overall dietary patterns, may provide more useful information
on the role of diet in breast cancer risk than a single-nutrient
approach. However, inference from population studies is difficult
because of measurement error in dietary assessment that arises
from dietary data being self-reported, often retrospective, and
collected using food frequency questionnaires that require
many assumptions (i.e., recipes, food composition tables) to
derive nutrient and food intakes.
Diet is also recognized as a major component shaping the gut
microbiome. Distinct patterns of gut microbiota composition are
associated with the habitual consumption of animal fats, high-
fiber diets, and vegetable-based diets (Cotillard et al., 2013; Da-
vid et al., 2014; Schnorr et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2011). Adherence
to a Mediterranean diet decreased Ruminococcus and increased
fecal Lachnospira and Prevotella in fecal samples, compared
with samples from people consuming an omnivore diet (De Fili-
ppis et al., 2016). However, dietary influences on the microbiome
in other tissue or organ sites other than the gut are undetermined.
A mammary gland-specific microbiome has been identified
(Urbaniak et al., 2014). Mammary gland samples obtained from
women undergoing lumpectomies, mastectomies, or breast

 reduction procedures living in Canada or Ireland showed distinct
genus taxa differences: mammary gland samples from Canadian
women displayed a high proportional abundance of Bacillus,
Acinetobacter, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Staphylo-
coccus, Propionibacterium, and Prevotella. Mammary gland
samples from Irish women displayed a more than 3-fold higher
abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, a 2-fold higher abundance
of Staphylococcus, high Listeria welshimeri, a 2-fold higher
abundance of Propionibacterium, and similar proportional abun-
dance of Pseudomonas compared with Canadian women’s
breast samples (Urbaniak et al., 2014). Whether the observed
taxa differences or abundance differences were due to differ-
ences in BMI or obesity is unknown, because those data were
unreported in the study. In another study investigating the micro-
biome of mammary gland tissue obtained from patients with
benign tumors or malignant breast cancers, breast tissue from
those with malignant breast cancer had decreased Lactobacillus
(Hieken et al., 2016), suggesting mammary tissue dysbiosis as a
possible driver of breast cancer.
To investigate the potential of diet pattern to modify breast tis-
sue-specific microbiota populations, we obtained mammary
gland samples from female Macaca fascicularis monkeys fed a
Western diet or a Mediterranean diet for 31 months. This species
is a well-established model of women’s health, with consider-
able use in the study of breast cancer risk (Dewi et al., 2013;
Shively et al., 2004; Stute et al., 2006, 2012; Wood et al., 2006,
2007a, 2007b, 2007c). Our present study demonstrates that
diet modulates mammary gland-specific microbiota. Consump-
tion of a Mediterranean diet was associated with 10-fold higher
breast tissue Lactobacillus abundance and altered breast tissue
bile acid metabolite levels and bacterial-processed bioactive
compounds, clearly demonstrating a dietary contribution to
mammary gland health and homeostasis with implications for
breast cancer prevention.
RESULTS
Female monkeys (M. fascicularis) were fed a Western diet or a
Mediterranean diet for 31 months (see Table S1 for diet details).
Mammary gland tissue sections (locations of tissue samples har-
vested for analyses are shown in Figure 1A) were used for 16S
sequencing. We sequenced 16S (V4 region) genes on an Illumina
MiSeq. We obtained 9.2096 3 104 high-quality bacterial reads.
The final dataset had 1,470 operational taxonomic unit (OTUs)
(including those occurring once with a count of 1) and a read
range of 560 and 6,292. We excluded samples with fewer than
500 reads; a more typical cutoff is 1,000 reads. The number is
arbitrary, but it is sufficient to reveal the most important gradients
in microbial composition, even in high-diversity settings such as
the gut. In breast tissue, where microbial diversity is lower, we
used a lower cutoff to be sufficient.
We summarized OTU abundances with the Bray-Curtis index
and performed a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)
analysis to visualize microbiome similarities in ordination plots
(Figure 1B). Formal significance testing was achieved with
permutational ANOVAs. Mediterranean diet consumers had
markedly different mammary gland microbiota populations
compared with mammary glands from monkeys consuming a
Western diet, resulting in two distinct microbiota populations
based on dietary consumption. Diet had no effect on microbial
load (Figure 1C) or alpha diversity (Figure 1D).
High-quality reads were classified using Greengenes as
the reference database. We obtained consensus taxonomy
for each OTU. We then aggregated OTU abundances into

 taxonomies and plotted the relative abundances. Consump-
tion of Mediterranean diet was associated with significantly
increased mammary gland Fusobacteria phylum populations,
compared with a Western diet (Figure 2A). Consumption of Med-
iterranean diet was associated with decreased mammary gland
abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae bacteria
and increased Lactobacillaceae populations compared with a
Western diet (Figure 2B). After aggregating OTU abundances
into genus-level groupings (Figures 2C and 3), we observed an
approximate 10-fold higher Lactobacillus abundance in the
Mediterranean diet versus the Western diet group. Western
diet-fed monkeys also had significantly higher abundance of
Ruminococcus, Lachnospiraceae, Oscillospira, and Coprococ-
cus genus bacteria in their mammary gland tissue.
We used an untargeted global metabolomics approach to
determine metabolite difference in mammary glands regulated
by diet. Mediterranean diet consumers had significantly higher
mammary gland levels of the bile acid metabolites cholate, gly-
cocholate (GCA), taurocholate (TCA), and chenodeoxycholate
(CDCA) compared with monkeys fed a Western diet (Figures
4A–4C and 4E). Although detectable (Figures 4D and 4F–4H),
there were no significant differences in deoxycholate (DCA),
glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDCA), glycodeoxycholate, or taur-
odeoxycholate levels. Analysis of circulating plasma bile acid
metabolites showed increased circulating cholate (Figure S1A)
in blood from Mediterranean diet-fed monkeys compared
with Western diet-fed animals. No other bile acid metabolites
were significantly different between dietary groups (Figures
S1B–S1H).
In the past decade, high levels of interest in gut microbiota ef-
fects on metabolite processing have led to the discovery of new
bacterial-mediated transformation of dietary components and
their impact on host health and the development of disease

(Holmes et al., 2012; Zhang and Davies,
2016). Multiple metabolomic studies us-
ing germ-free and conventionally housed
mice along with antibiotic-treated mice
have identified metabolites regulated by
host bacterial populations. We observed
higher levels of many of these bacteria-
processed metabolites in the mammary glands of Mediterranean
diet-fed monkeys relative to metabolite levels in mammary
glands of Western diet-fed monkeys (Figure 5). Consumption
of Mediterranean diet was associated with significant elevations
of hippurate (Figure 5A), p-cresol glucuronide (Figure 5B),
3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionate (Figure 5C), cinnamoylglycine
(Figure 5D), 3-indoxyl sulfate (Figure 5E), indole propionate (Fig-
ure 5F), indolin-2-one (Figure 5G), and trimethylamine N-oxide
(Figure 5H) compared with Western diet. Mammary gland levels
of the parent amino acids from which the bioactive microbial-
derived compounds are derived (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and
tryptophan) were not significantly altered between dietary
groups in the mammary glands (Figure S2). Analyses of circu-
lating plasma levels of bacterial-processed metabolites indicate
differential regulation of bacterial-modified compounds when
comparing regulated metabolites in the mammary gland with
bacterial-modified metabolites in plasma samples. There were
no diet-related differences in levels of phenylalanine-derived
bacterial-modified metabolites (hippurate, 3-hydroxy-3- phenyl-
propionate, and cinnamoylglycine), but p-cresol-glucuronide,
3-indoxyl sulfate, indole propionate, and trimethylamine N-oxide
were significantly elevated in the plasma of Mediterranean diet
consumers (Figure S3). These data suggest that the elevated

metabolites may be site specific, possibly through modification

remained unchanged.
Diet along with microbial-mediated metabolites may regulate
oxidative stress. We investigated the oxidative stress, inflam-
mation, antioxidant, and reactive oxygen species-scavenging
metabolite data to determine whether diet affected these
processes in the mammary gland tissue (Figure 6). Consump-
tion of the Mediterranean diet led to upregulated 14-HDoHE,

compared with Mediterranean diet (Figure 6A). Analysis of
reduced glutathione (GSH)-to-oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio
in the mammary gland tissues indicated elevated GSH-to-GSSG
ratio in the Mediterranean diet-fed monkeys (Figure 6B).
DISCUSSION
Consumption of a Mediterranean diet was associated with
distinct mammary gland microbiota populations compared
with Western diets, but no differences were observed in total
bacteria content or diversity (Figure 1). Similar to human studies
determining effects of Mediterranean diets on gut microbiota
populations,
Ruminococcus
abundance
was
significantly
decreased in mammary gland tissue of the Mediterranean diet
group, suggesting some commonly regulated microbiota popu-
lation between gut and mammary gland tissues (De Filippis
et al., 2016). Unlike the human gut microbiome, consumption
of Mediterranean diet was not associated with non-human pri-
mate mammary gland Prevotella abundance and was associ-
ated with reduced Lachnospiraceae abundance, suggesting
that there may be differential regulation of microbiota by diet de-
pending on tissue type (Figures 2 and 3). The fecal microbiome of
a subset of these monkeys consuming either a Western (n = 10)
or Mediterranean (n = 10) diet was also explored (Nagpal et al.,
2018). Interestingly, the effect of diet on the fecal microbiome
compared with the mammary gland microbiome displayed
similarities as well as divergence. Increased Lactobacillus and
decreased Ruminococcus and Coprococcus populations were
observed in both mammary gland and feces of Mediterranean
diet-fed monkeys. For Oscillospira, there were higher levels in
feces and lower levels in mammary gland of Mediterranean
diet-fed monkeys compared with the Western diet-consuming

counterparts. Some microbiota popula-
tions differed by diet group in the feces
but not in the mammary gland, as Faeca-
libacterium and Prevotella were higher
in the feces but not mammary gland of
Mediterranean diet-fed monkeys.
Using a non-human primate model, we
demonstrated that diet alone may modu-
late mammary gland microbiota population. Consumption of
Mediterranean diet resulted in an approximate 10-fold increase
in mammary gland Lactobacillus abundance compared with
mammary tissue from Western diet-fed monkeys. Lactobacillus
is often thought of as commensal bacteria and is commonly used
in probiotic formulations. Oral consumption of Lactobacillus
decreased triple-negative 4T1 breast cancer tumor growth in a
syngeneic breast cancer model (Arago
´ n et al., 2014; Maroof
et al., 2012). This anti-tumor effect is thought to be mediated
by immune cell modulation. For example, Lactobacillus adminis-
tration in breast tumor-bearing mice altered cytokine production
in favor of an anti-tumor Th1 profile (Maroof et al., 2012). Others
showed that oral Lactobacillus increased immune cell stimula-
tion in intestinal Peyer’s patches with subsequent increased
migration to a host of other organ locations, including mammary
gland tissue, implicating Lactobacillus supplementation as a
possible breast cancer prevention agent (Brandtzaeg et al.,
2004; de Moreno de LeBlanc et al., 2005). Intestinal immune
stimulation followed by migration to distant organ sites repre-
sents one possible mechanism by which oral probiotics may
affect tumorigenesis. However, lactating women given a daily
oral dose of Lactobacillus displayed elevated Lactobacillus pop-
ulations in their breast milk, suggesting that oral consumption of
probiotics can directly affect the mammary gland microbiome
(Jime
´ nez et al., 2008). Moreover, orally administered Lactoba-
cillus salivarius in late pregnancy significantly decreased the
rate and severity of lactation mastitis, giving further evidence in
support of orally administered bacteria modulating breast health
(Ferna
´ ndez et al., 2016). Our study now provides strong evi-
dence that dietary intake alone may modulate the mammary
gland microbiome (Figures 2C and 3), especially because sub-
jects were living side by side in the same building, representing
a breast cancer prevention model.
We found elevated bile acid metabolites (Figure 4) in mammary
glands of monkeys fed a Mediterranean diet compared with
those fed a Western diet. The presence of bile acid in cystic
breast tissue was identified decades ago in humans (Javitt
50
Cell Reports 25, 47–56, October 2, 2018
 et al., 1994). In women given oral labeled CDCA before breast
cyst aspiration, CDCA levels were concentrated in the cyst fluid
rather than circulating in the plasma. Moreover, farnesoid X
receptor, a bile acid receptor, was identified both in benign and
malignant breast tissue; it was associated with increased
apoptosis and repressed aromatase expression (Swales et al.,
2006).Therefore, elevated bile acid metabolites may increase far-
nesoid X receptor (NR1H4) activation; this would then decrease
localized estrogen synthesis and increase apoptosis, reducing
breast neoplastic potential. Treatment of the estrogen receptor-
positive breast cancer cell line MCF7 with either CDCA or GCDCA
resulted in differential effects on proliferation; GCDCA increased
MCF7 proliferation, while treatment with CDCA reduced prolifer-
ation (Baker et al., 1992). We observed increased CDCA metab-
olite levels (anti-proliferative) in mammary glands of monkeys
fed a Mediterranean diet (Figures 4E and 4F), with no significant

(proliferative),
possibly implicating bile acid metabolite
regulation as a breast cancer preven-
tion mechanism modulated by diet. TCA
and GCA metabolites were enriched in
mammary glands from Mediterranean
diet-consuming monkeys compared with
mammary gland tissue from Western
diet-consuming monkeys (Figures 4B
and 4C). These conjugated bile acids are
modified by the presence of microbes (Ri-
dlon et al., 2014, 2016a, 2016b; Swann
et al., 2011). Interestingly, analysis of
circulating plasma bile acid metabolite
levels indicated no significant regulation
of GCA, TCA, or CDCA by diet (Figure S1),
most likely suggesting mammary gland-
specific microbial modulation of bile acid
metabolites (another possibility being
the preferential accumulation of bile acids
in the mammary gland tissue). Lactoba-
cillus contains bile salt hydrolase activity,
which was previously shown to be neces-
sary for the production of secondary bile acid metabolites that
serve as agonists for farnesoid X receptors (Li et al., 2013). The
enrichment of Lactobacillus in the mammary glands of Mediterra-
nean diet-fed monkeys (Figures 2C and 3) may then increase
mammary gland-specific secondary bile acid metabolites to acti-
vate farnesoid X receptor (NR1H4) signaling for anticancer prop-
erties. Elevated plasma DCA was observed in postmenopausal
women with newly diagnosed breast cancer compared with
healthy age- and BMI-matched control plasma samples (Costar-
elli and Sanders, 2002a, 2002b). DCA is a mutagenic compound
(Watabe and Bernstein, 1985). We observed no significant
changes in DCA bile acid metabolite levels by diet, but there
was a trend toward decreased DCA in the plasma of Mediterra-
nean diet-fed monkeys (Figure S1).
On the other hand, estrogen metabolites are conjugated to bile
acids for excretion. Bacteria with b-glucuronidase activity can

 deconjugate estrogen from bile acids to elevate estrogen metab-
olite bioavailability (Kwa et al., 2016). Lactobacillus has b-glucu-
ronidase activity, suggesting that mammary glands from Medi-
terranean diet-fed monkeys with high Lactobacillus abundance
(Figures 2 and 3) and higher bile acid metabolites (Figure 4)
may have elevated localized estrogen bioavailability because
of bacterial-mediated deconjugation independent of aromatase
activity. We measured circulating serum estradiol levels at the
time of necropsy in monkeys consuming Western or Mediterra-
nean diet and observed comparable levels in the two groups
(p = 0.29) (Table 1). Mammary tissue levels of estradiol were
not measured and could differ depending on the tissue milieu
of hormone converting enzymes and hormones that may be ef-
fected by microbiota. Tissue-level regulation of estradiol will be
explored further in future studies. Although b-glucuronidase-

effect of enriched breast tissue-specific

lites needs further investigation.
There is a growing body of evidence
demonstrating an association between
phenolic
and
phytochemical
compo-
nents in Mediterranean diets and impor-
tant health benefits (Visioli and Bernar-
dini,
2011).
As
shown
in
Figure
5,
monkeys consuming a Mediterranean
diet had significantly higher levels of
several conjugated phenolic metabolites
such as p-cresol sulfate (tyrosine metab-
olite), hippurate, cinnamoylglycine, and
3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionate (phenylal-
anine metabolites) compared with the
Western diet group. Other metabolites
that accumulated in mammary tissue of
the
Mediterranean
diet-fed
monkeys
included indole-containing substances
(tryptophan metabolites) such as indo-
lin-2-one, 3-indole sulfate, and indole
propionate. These regulated polyphenol
metabolites could have come from the
olive oil, fruits, and vegetables enriched
in the Mediterranean diet compared with the Western diet. There
were no significant differences in tryptophan, phenylalanine, or
tyrosine metabolite levels in the mammary glands (parental
amino acid metabolite data shown in Figure S2), suggesting
that these metabolite changes may reflect changes in microbial
metabolism within the two diet regimens. Further supporting the
role of microbial mediated bioactive compound generation,
there were no changes in plasma metabolite levels of hippurate,
cinnamoylglycine, 3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionate, or phenylala-
nine (Figure S3) by diet, suggesting the microbial modulation of
these metabolites may be localized to the mammary gland tis-
sue. There were significant differences in circulating plasma me-
tabolites p-cresol sulfate, tyrosine, tryptophan, 3-indole sulfate,
and indole propionate (Figures S2 and S3), possibly indicating
gut microbiome-dependent systematic effects.

(Wikoff et al., 2009). We observed elevated hippurate (Figure 5A)

that the levels of benzoate-derived metabolites in those fed a
Mediterranean diet correlated with increased fruit and vegetable
intake but not mammary gland bacterial diversity (Figure 1E).

derived metabolites 3-indoxyl sulfate (Figure 5E), indole propio-

monkeys) and Clostridium (trend toward
higher levels in Mediterranean diet-fed
monkeys) can convert tryptophan into
indole-derived bioactive products (Chyan
et al., 1999; Wikoff et al., 2009; Zelante
et al., 2013; Zhang and Davies, 2016),
which have diverse biological functions, including activation of
aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated IL-22 production support-
ing Th17 response, stimulation of pregnane X receptor (NR1I2)
to inhibit pro-tumorigenic NFkB signaling, and decreased pro-in-
flammatory TNF-a cytokine production. Some indole products
also scavenge hydroxyl radicals, supporting an antioxidant envi-
ronment (Chyan et al., 1999; Venkatesh et al., 2014; Zhou et al.,
2006). Activation of Th17 immune responses may initially prevent
establishment of tumor formation (Lim and Savan, 2014). More-
over, inhibition of inflammation and reduction of reactive oxygen
species may prevent the development of breast cancer, high-
lighting possible molecular mechanisms by which dietary modu-
lated bacterial-processed bioactive metabolites may inhibit
breast cancer formation. In support of this mechanism, we
show that Mediterranean diet consumers had reduced oxidative
stress and pro-inflammatory metabolites in the mammary gland
tissue (Figure 6). This was associated with an increase in reactive
oxygen species-scavenging metabolites and decreased pro-
inflammatory oxidized lipid products, suggesting that regulation
of microbial-mediated metabolites by Mediterranean diet con-
sumption may affect localized mammary gland oxidative stress.

 In conclusion, we determined that diet significantly regulated
mammary gland-specific microbiome populations in a well-es-
tablished non-human primate model of women’s health. Mam-
mary gland from Mediterranean diet consumers had a 10-fold
higher Lactobacillus abundance compared with Western diet-
fed monkeys. Conversely, Western diet-fed monkeys had signif-
icantly higher abundance of Ruminococcus, Lachnospiraceae,
Oscillospira, and Coprococcus genus bacteria in their mammary
gland tissue. Mammary gland samples from Mediterranean diet-
fed monkeys had elevated bile acid metabolites and bacterial-
processed bioactive compounds that may have anticancer
properties. Taken together, these data highlight the impact of
diet on mammary gland-specific microbiota and metabolites,
which may represent a potential mechanism by which diet
can affect breast inflammation and modulate breast cancer
risk. Thus, changes in diet or supplementation with selected
probiotics could represent a potential regimen for breast cancer
prevention.

either Western or Mediterranean diet for 31 months using stratified randomization, balanced on pretreatment characteristics that
reflect overall health including body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), basal cortisol, and plasma high density lipoprotein choles-
terol concentrations. See Table 1 for baseline and terminal metabolic parameters. BMI was calculated as previously described (Jayo
et al., 1993). In brief, BW and body length (suprasternal notch to pubic symphysis) were measured at the end of 7-month baseline
metabolic normalization period and again after the 31 months of experimental diet administration. BMI was calculated as BW/
(body length (m))2. For cortisol measurements, a morning blood samples were taken within 5 min of capture and sedation with ke-
tamine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg) and used with commercially available coated tube RIA kit from Diasource (Louvain-la-Neuve,
Belgium). Total plasma cholesterol (TPC) and HDL were measured as previously described (Sophonsritsuk et al., 2013). In brief,
TPC and HDL were determined in the Wake Forest Primate Center Clinical Chemistry Laboratory using ACE cholesterol and ACE
HDL-C reagents and ACE ALERA autoanalyzer from Alfa Wasserman Diagnostic Technologies (West Caldwell, NJ). Estradiol was
measured in serum samples obtained at necropsy using a commercially available competitive human targeted ELISA (Estradiol
(Sensitive) ELISA kit # IB78239) obtained from IBL America (Minneapolis, MN, USA). In brief, the kit components had a standard range
of 3.0 to 200.0 pg/mL and a reported sensitivity of < 1.4 pg/mL. In order to remove interfering substances, serum samples were
extracted with ether, the extract was then dried and reconstituted with the zero standard calibrator from the kit prior to analysis.
Values from human controls from outside manufacturers were within accepted ranges. Serum sample collection for estradiol mea-
surement was not timed by the menstrual cycle.
METHOD DETAILS
Diets
Monkeys consumed either the Western or Mediterranean Diets (See Table S1. Ingredients in experimental diets. Related to Table 1)
which were formulated to be isocaloric with respect to protein, fat and carbohydrates, and identical in cholesterol content (�320mg /
2000 calories/day). The Western diet was formulated to be similar to that consumed by American women age 40-49 as reported by
the USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, 2014). Specifically, protein and fat were derived mainly
from animal sources; the diet was high in saturated fats and sodium, and low in monounsaturated (MUFA) and n-3 fatty acids
(U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, 2014). The Mediterranean diet was formulated to mimic key aspects
of the Mediterranean diet. Protein and fats are derived mainly from plant sources, with some lean protein from fish and dairy, and
MUFAs are relatively high (Be
´ dard et al., 2012; Kafatos et al., 2000). The Mediterranean diet n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio was similar to
a traditional hunter-gatherer type diet (Cordain et al., 2005), higher in complex carbohydrates and fiber, and lower in sodium and
refined sugars (see Table S2. Experimental diet composition compared with human dietary patterns. Related to Table 1). Two animals
were placed on a standard monkey chow due to Mediterranean diet intolerance. The data from these animals are not shown.
Breast tissue and plasma collection
Plasma was collected after 23 months of diet consumption. Breast tissue was collected after 31 months of diet consumption.
Following ketamine (15 mg/kg) sedation sodium pentobarbital was administered to attain surgical anesthesia (approximately
13 mg/kg, i.v.). Tissues were collected according to the diagram shown in Figure 1A and snap frozen at –80�C or fixed in 4% para-
formaldehyde. The final sample size was n = 21 for Western diet and n = 17 for Mediterranean diet.
DNA extraction, PCR, sequencing, and sequence processing
Mammary gland specimens were placed into a MoBio PowerMag Soil DNA Isolation Bead Plate. DNA was extracted following the
manufacturer’s protocol. Bacterial 16S sequencing, data analysis, and interpretation were performed by Microbiome Insights, Van-
couver, Canada. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were PCR-amplified with dual-barcoded primers targeting the V4 region, following the
methods of (Kozich et al., 2013). Amplicons were sequenced with an Illumina MiSeq using the 250-bp paired-end kit (v.2). Sequences
were denoised, taxonomically classified using Greengenes (v. 13_8) as the reference database (https://www.mothur.org/wiki/
Greengenes-formatted_databases), and clustered into 97%-similarity operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with the mothur software
package (v. 1.39.5) (Schloss et al., 2009), following the recommended procedure (https://www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP; ac-
cessed Nov 2017). The potential for contamination was addressed by co-sequencing DNA amplified from specimens and from
four each of template-free controls and extraction kit reagents processed the same way as the specimens. Two positive controls,
consisting of cloned SUP05 DNA, were also included (number of copies = 2*10^
6). In brief, the SUP05 16S DNA sequence was taken
from environmental data via. (NCBI Sequence ID: HQ673668.1). The sequence was then synthetically created using IDT gBlocks
(https://www.idtdna.com/site/order/gblockentry [idtdna.com]), which was then PCR amplified and plasmid cloned using Invitrogen’s
TOPO cloning kit (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/K457501 [thermofisher.com]). The cloned plasmid
sequence was verified using our standard amplicon sequencing protocol. Operational taxonomic units were considered putative
contaminants (and were removed) if their mean abundance in controls reached or exceeded 25% of their mean abundance in
specimens.

 Metabolomics analysis
Samples were processed and metabolomics was performed by Metabolon, Raleigh, NC. In brief, samples were prepared using the
automated MicroLab STAR� system from Hamilton Company. Several recovery standards (see below) were added prior to the
extraction process for quality control purposes. The resulting extract was divided into five fractions: two for analysis by two separate
reverse phase (RP)/UPLC-MS/MS methods with positive ion mode electrospray ionization (ESI), one for analysis by RP/UPLC-MS/
MS with negative ion mode ESI, one for analysis by HILIC/UPLC-MS/MS with negative ion mode ESI, and one sample was reserved
for backup. Samples were placed briefly on a TurboVap� (Zymark) to remove the organic solvent.
Authentic and Recovery standards used in non-targeted global metabolomics
Authentic standards of d7-glucose, d3-leucine, d8-phenylalanine and d5-tryptophan were purchased from Cambridge Isotope
Laboratories (Andover, MA). D5-hippuric acid, d5-indole acetic acid and d9-progesterone were procured from C/D/N Isotopes,
Inc. (Pointe-Claire, Quebec). Bromophenylalanine was provided by Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC. (St. Louis, MO) and amitriptyline was
from MP Biomedicals, LLC. (Aurora, OH). Recovery standards of DL-2-fluorophenylglycine and DL-4-chlorophenylalanine were
from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, WI). Tridecanoic acid was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and d6-cholesterol
was from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Standards for the HILIC dilution series of alpha-ketoglutarate, ATP, malic
acid, NADH and oxaloacetic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC. (St. Louis, MO) while succinic acid, pyruvic acid and
NAD+ were purchased from MP Biomedicals, LLC. (Santa Ana, CA).
Ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS)
All experiments used a Waters ACQUITY ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive high
resolution/accurate mass spectrometer interfaced with a heated electrospray ionization (HESI-II) source and Orbitrap mass analyzer
operated at 35,000 mass resolution. The scan range varied slighted between methods but covered 70-1000 m/z. Raw data were
extracted, peak- identified and processed for quality control using Metabolon’s hardware and software. Compounds were identified
by comparison to library entries of purified standards or recurrent unknown entities. Peaks were quantified using area-under-the-
curve.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
16S statistical analysis
Alpha diversity was estimated with the Shannon index on raw OTU abundance tables after filtering out contaminants. The signifi-
cance of diversity differences was tested with an ANOVA. To estimate beta diversity across samples, we excluded OTUs occurring
in fewer than 10% of the samples with a count of less than three and computed Bray-Curtis indices. We visualized beta diversity,
emphasizing differences across samples, using non-metric multidimensional (NMDS) ordination. No significant pen effect was
observed on microbiota populations. Variation in community structure was assessed with permutational multivariate analyses of
variance (PERMANOVA) with treatment group as the main fixed factor and using 4,999 permutations for significance testing. All
analyses were conducted using R software. Proportional abundance of selected microbiota were graphed and multiple unpaired
t tests performed (correcting for multiple comparisons using Holm-Sidak method) was used and a value of p % 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Metabolomics bioinformatics and statistics
The informatics system consisted of four major components, the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), the data
extraction and peak-identification software, data processing tools for quality control and compound identification, and a collection
of information interpretation and visualization tools for use by data analysts. The hardware and software foundations for these
informatics components were the LAN backbone, and a database server running Oracle 10.2.1.1 Enterprise Edition, respectively.
Following log transformation and imputation of missing values, if any, with the minimum observed value for each compound, Welch’s
two-sample t test was used to identify biochemicals that differed significantly between Western diet and Mediterranean diet
experimental groups. A p value of p % 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
