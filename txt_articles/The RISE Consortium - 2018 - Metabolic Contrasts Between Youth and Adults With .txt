OBJECTIVE
To compare insulin sensitivity (M/I) and b-cell responses in youth versus adults with
impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or drug-na¨
ıve, recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
In 66 youth (80.3% with IGT) and 355 adults (70.7% IGT), hyperglycemic clamps
were used to measure 1) M/I, 2) acute (0–10 min [first phase]) C-peptide (ACPRg)
and insulin (AIRg) responses to glucose, 3) steady-state C-peptide and insulin con-
centrationsat plasmaglucoseof11.1mmol/L,and4)arginine-stimulatedmaximum
C-peptide (ACPRmax) and insulin (AIRmax) responses at plasma glucose >25 mmol/L.
The fasting C-peptide–to–insulin ratio was used as an estimate of insulin clearance.
RESULTS
Insulin sensitivity was 46% lower in youth compared with adults (P < 0.001), and
youth had greater acute and steady-state C-peptide (2.3- and 1.3-fold, respectively;
each P < 0.001) and insulin responses to glucose (AIRg 3.0-fold and steady state
2.2-fold; each P < 0.001). Arginine-stimulated C-peptide and insulin responses were
also greater in youth (1.6- and 1.7-fold, respectively; each P < 0.001). After
adjustment for insulin sensitivity, all b-cell responses remained significantly greater
in youth. Insulin clearance was reduced in youth (P < 0.001). Participants with diabetes
had greater insulin sensitivity (P = 0.026), with lesser C-peptide and insulin responses
than those with IGT (all P < 0.001) but similar insulin clearance (P = 0.109).
CONCLUSIONS
In people with IGT or recently diagnosed diabetes, youth have lower insulin
sensitivity, hyperresponsive b-cells, and reduced insulin clearance compared with
adults. Whether these age-related differences contribute to declining b-cell
function and/or impact responses to glucose-lowering interventions remains to
be determined.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY/COMPLICATIONS
 Across the life span, the prevalence of
impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and
type 2 diabetes is rising worldwide (1–3).
This increase has been driven in part by
an escalation in the prevalence of obe-
sity,whichafflictsnolongeronlymiddle-
aged and older individuals but also
youth (4,5).
Type 2 diabetes and its precursor,
prediabetes, are characterized by insu-
lin resistance and b-cell dysfunction in
youth and adults (6–9). However, the
progression of dysglycemia appears to
be more aggressive in youth (10–12). The
Restoring Insulin Secretion (RISE) Study
provides a unique opportunity to com-
pare the physiologic features that un-
derlie dysglycemia in youth and adults.
RISE is evaluating different interventions
to prevent the progressive loss of b-cell
function in youth and adults with pre-
diabetes or recent-onset type 2 diabetes
(13). The three RISE protocols contain
many common design elements, includ-
ing phenotyping of participants using
the hyperglycemic clamp to measure
insulin sensitivity (M/I) and three differ-
ent b-cell responses: two acute and one
during prolonged stimulation. The pres-
ent report uses the baseline hyperglyce-
micclampdatatoexamineinsulinsensitivity
and b-cell function in youth versus adults
with IGT or recently diagnosed type 2
diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Participants
Individuals at high risk for IGT and type 2
diabetes (see Supplementary Appendix 2)
who met other study inclusion/exclusion
criteria were screened with a 75-g oral
glucose tolerance test and hemoglobin
A1c (HbA1c) test. Youth aged 10–19
years with pubertal development be-
yond Tanner stage $II were eligible for
the RISE Pediatric Medication Study if they
had a fasting plasma glucose $5 mmol/L
plus 2-h glucose $7.8 mmol/L and 1)
HbA1c #64 mmol/mol if drug na¨
ıve, 2)
HbA1c #58.5 mmol/mol if on metformin
for ,3 months, or 3) #53 mmol/mol if on
metformin for 3–6 months. Adults were
eligible for the RISE Adult Medica-
tion Study if they had a fasting plasma glu-
cose 5.3–6.9 mmol/L plus 2-h glucose
$7.8 mmol/L and HbA1c #53 mmol/mol.
Adults were eligible for the RISE Adult
Surgery Study (BetaFat) if they had a
fastingglucose .5 mmol/L plus 2-h glucose
$7.8 mmol/L and HbA1c ,53 mmol/mol.
In both adult studies, individuals with
known diabetesfor ,1year wereeligibleif
they had never received glucose-lowering
medications and qualified otherwise.
Eighty-eightparticipantswere random-
ized into the Adult Surgery Study,267into
the Adult Medication Study, and 91
into the Pediatric Medication Study.
Of the 91 pediatric participants, 25 ei-
ther were on metformin at the time of
randomization or had previously been
exposed to it. These participants were
excluded from the analyses herein to
avoid potential confounding by this expo-
sure.Allparticipantsgavewritteninformed
consent/assent, consistent with the Dec-
laration of Helsinki and the guidelines of
each center’s institutional review board.
Anthropometric Measurements
Anthropometric measurements were
performed with participants wearing
light clothing without shoes. Waist cir-
cumference was measured in a horizon-
tal plane at the midpoint between the
top of the iliac crest and the bottom of
the costal margin in the midaxillary line
using a fiberglass (nonstretching) tape.
Height was measured in a fully vertical
position with heels together using a cali-
brated stadiometer. Weight was mea-
sured using a calibrated electronic scale,
zeroed before each measurement.
Procedures
After a 10-h overnight fast, a two-step
hyperglycemic clamp was performed.
The overall approach is outlined in
Supplementary Fig. 1.
For the first step, the steady-state
target blood glucose concentration of
11.1mmol/Lwasachievedusinganinitial
intravenous bolus of 20% dextrose (vol-
ume in mL calculated as weight [kg] *
[200 2 fasting blood glucose in mg/dL] *
1.1/180) administered over 60 seconds,
after which infusion of 20% dextrose was
commenced at a rate calculated as (weight
[kg] * 5 * 60)/180). Starting at 10 min after
the initial dextrose bolus, the rate of the
infusion was modified based on a comput-
erized algorithm combined with bedside
blood glucose monitoring every 5–10 min.
During this first step of the clamp, arterialized
blood samples were drawn through an in-
dwelling intravenous catheter in a warmed
handbeforeandat2,4,6,8,10,100,110,and
120 min.
For the second step, the target blood
glucose of .25 mmol/L was achieved
using a second bolus of 20% dextrose
administered over 60 seconds (volume
in mL calculated as weight [kg] * [450 2
current blood glucose in mg/dL] * 1.1/
180). The 20% dextrose infusion rate was
then increased (typically to the pump’s
maximum rate of 999 mL/h) and ad-
justed based on bedside blood glucose
monitoring every 5 min. If the bedside
blood glucose was not .22.2 mmol/L by
15 min after commencement of the
second step of the clamp, an additional
bolus of 50 mL of 50% dextrose was
administered over 2 min. Once the target
blood glucose of .25 mmol/L was at-
tained for a minimum of 30 min, but no
more than 45 min after commencement
of the second step, a bolus of L-arginine
(5 g) was administered over 1 min.
Blood samples for subsequent assays
were drawn at 25, 21, 2, 3, 4, and
5 min relative to the arginine injection.
Assays
All blood samples were immediately
placed on ice, separated by centrifu-
gation, and frozen at 280°C prior to
shipment to the central biochemistry
laboratory at the University of Washing-
ton. Plasma glucose concentrations for
use in end point calculations were mea-
sured on these samples by the glu-
cose hexokinase method using Roche
reagent on a Roche c501 autoana-
lyzer. The method’s interassay coef-
ficient of variation (CV) on quality
control samples with low, medium, and
high concentrations was 2.0%, 1.7%, and
1.3%,respectively.C-peptideandinsulin
were measured by a two-site immuno-
enzymometric assay performed on the
Tosoh 2000 autoanalyzer (Tosoh Biosci-
ence, Inc., South San Francisco, CA). The
interassay CV for C-peptide on quality
control samples with low, medium,
medium-high, and high concentrations
was 4.3%, 3.6%, 3.2%, and 2.6%. The
assay has a minimum detectable concen-
tration of 0.007 nmol/L, a standard curve
linearto10nmol/L,andcross-reactivityof
0.05% with intact proinsulin, 0.02% with
the proinsulin fragment containing amino
acids 31–65, and zero with insulin. For the
insulin assay, the interassay CV on quality
control samples with low, medium, me-
dium-high, and high concentrations was
3.5%, 3.0%, 3.3%, and 2.9%. The assay
hasaminimumdetectableconcentration

reactivities: intact proinsulin 2.0%, split

version factors with the exception of

Calculations for Clamp-Derived
Measurements
Insulin Sensitivity
Insulin sensitivity (M/I) was quantified as
the mean of the glucose infusion rate (M)
at 100, 110, and 120 min of the clamp,
expressed per kilogram of body weight
and corrected for urinary glucose loss,
divided by the mean steady-state plasma
insulin concentration at these same time
points (I) (14–16). Urinary glucose loss
was the product of the urinary glucose
concentration and urinary volume.
C-peptide and Insulin Responses
Acute (first-phase) C-peptide (ACPRg)
and insulin (AIRg) responses to glucose
were calculated as the mean incremen-
tal response above baseline (average
of 210 and 25 min) from samples drawn
at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min after intravenous
dextrose administration (17). Steady-state
(second-phase) C-peptide and insulin con-
centrations were calculated as the mean
of the respective measurements at 100,
110, and 120 min of the hyperglycemic
clamp (16). Acute C-peptide (ACPRmax)
and insulin (AIRmax) responses to argi-
nine at maximal glycemic potentiation
(.25 mmol/L) were calculated as the
mean concentrations in samples drawn
2, 3, 4, and 5 min after arginine injection
minus the average concentration of the
samples drawn 1 and 5 min prior to
arginine (18).
Insulin Clearance
The ratio of fasting C-peptide to fasting
insulin was calculated as an estimate of
insulin clearance (19). The rationale for
this approach is the equimolar secretion
ofbothpeptides and the lack ofC-peptide
extraction by the liver. Consequently,
under steady-state conditions, the C-
peptide–to–insulin molar ratio is pro-
portional to the hepatic clearance rate
of insulin.
Additional details on participant in-
clusion/exclusion criteria, procedures,
and measurements have previously been
published (13) and are provided in the
three study protocols available at https://
rise.bsc.gwu.edu/web/rise/collaborators.
Data Management and Statistical
Analyses
The SAS analysis system (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) and R (The R Foundation) were
used for all statistical analyses. Descrip-
tive statistics are presented as percen-
tages, mean 6 SD, geometric means, and
95% CIs for nonnormally distributed
data; for the geometric means, P values
from the log-transformed data are
presented. Comparisonsbetween groups
were computed using ANOVA, x2 tests, or
Student t tests. Nominal P values are
presented. Except where noted, P val-
ues ,0.05 were considered nominally
statistically significant, with no adjust-
ments made for multiple tests.
Linear regression models were used
to evaluate the relationship of C-peptide
or insulin responses with insulin sensi-
tivity(M/I).Therelationshipbetweenthe
steady-state insulin response and M/I
was not evaluated because the steady-
state insulin values are included in each
calculation. All models used natural log-
arithmically transformed M/I and b-cell
response variables owing to the skewed
distribution of these data. Prior to taking
logs, we added a constant of 1.06 to
the ACPRg and 10.0 to the AIRg because
ofnegativevaluesintheseb-cellresponse
variables.
We were interested in whether the
various metabolic responses differed be-
tween youth and adults and between
those with IGT and type 2 diabetes at
baseline. Therefore, for each C-peptide
and insulin response variable, a model
was constructed including the effect of
M/I and both of these group terms. A
three-way interaction for M/I by youth/
adult and IGT/type 2 diabetes was run
first to assess whether the four separate
slopes of the response (e.g., C-peptide)
on M/I differed, i.e., whether the slopes
for adults with IGT, adults with diabetes,
youth with IGT, and youth with diabetes
were significantly different. In no case
was this true, so subsequent models
were built including two-way interac-
tion terms for [diabetes status * M/I]
and [age-group * M/I]. If both two-
way interaction tests were not significant
(i.e., the slopes in the two age-groups or
diabetes status groups were parallel), a
simple model was constructed, including
terms for diabetes status and age-group
without any interaction variables. Par-
allel slopes in these regression models
indicate that differences in b-cell re-
sponses are proportionate across the
range of insulin sensitivity.

ication protocol. Youth had a slightly
greater BMI and triponderal index (20)
than adults, but waist circumference did
not differ. HbA1c did not differ signifi-
cantly between the two age-groups.

were well matched for physical and de-

in their racial/ethnic distribution.
Clamp-Derived Measurements
in Youth Versus Adults
The plasma glucose, C-peptide, and in-
sulin concentrations during the two-step
hyperglycemic clamp are illustrated in
Fig. 1A–C for all individuals within each
protocol. Fasting glucose concentra-
tions were lower in youth than adults
(Table 1). Glucose goals were achieved
and maintained in all three protocols.
At all time points during the clamp,
C-peptide and insulin concentrations
were greater in youth than adults (all
P , 0.001). Throughout the clamp
procedures, plasma C-peptide and in-
sulin concentrationsweresimilarin adults
in the medication and surgical protocols;
thus, data from the two adult protocols
were pooled for subsequent analyses.
Fasting C-peptide and insulin concen-
trations were higher in youth than in
adults (Table 1). M/I in youth was ap-
proximately half that of adults. For
C-peptide and insulin, the first-phase
responses, steady-state concentrations,
and arginine responses were significantly
greater in youth than in adults (Table 1
and Fig. 1B and C).

Hyperglycemic Clamp in Youth and Adults in RISE
Diabetes Care Volume 41, August 2018
 Clamp-Derived Measurements in IGT
Versus Diabetes
Plasma glucose concentrations achieved
during the clamp were the same in par-
ticipants with IGT and recently diagnosed
diabetes (Fig. 1D and G). Concentrations
of fasting C-peptide and insulin were not
different in those with IGT and diabetes
(Supplementary Table 1). In both youth
(Fig. 1E and F) and adults (Fig. 1H and I),
C-peptideandinsulinconcentrationswere
greater in participants with IGT than in
those withdiabetes at all time points after
commencement of the glucose infusion.
M/I was significantly lower in those
with IGT, while all b-cell responses were
greaterinthosewithIGT(Supplementary
Table 1). The differences in b-cell re-
sponses remained significant after ad-
justment for M/I (all P , 0.001).
Relationship of Insulin Sensitivity With
b-Cell Responses in Youth Versus
Adults
The relationship between log-transformed
M/I and log-transformed first-phase,
steady-state, and maximal C-peptide
responses demonstrated significant in-
verse linear relationships in both youth
and adults (all P , 0.001) (Fig. 2A–C
[these panels illustrate the differences
in distribution ofM/Iand b-cell responses
between youth and adults]). The slopes
relating log M/I with log ACPRg, log steady-
state C-peptide, and log ACPRmax did not
differbetweenyouthandadults(P=0.200,
P = 0.357, and 0.780, respectively) (Fig.
2A–C). Across the range of M/I, ACPRg,
steady-state C-peptide, and ACPRmax
were greater in youth than adults
(P , 0.001 for both ACPRg and ACPRmax
and
P
=
0.047
for
steady-state
C-peptide). Details of these relationships
are provided in Supplementary Table 2.
Supplementary Fig. 2A–C illustrates these
relationships using natural scale data.

Relationship of Insulin Sensitivity
With b-Cell Responses in IGT Versus
Diabetes
After log transformation, the relation-
ships between M/I and first-phase,
steady-state, and maximal C-peptide re-
sponses were significantly inversely re-
lated in both IGT and diabetes (all P ,
0.001) (Fig. 3A–C). The slope relating M/I
to ACPRg was significantly different be-
tween those with IGT and diabetes (P =
0.031), with the slope for IGT slightly
steeper than that for diabetes (Fig. 3A).
Slopes for steady-state C-peptide and
ACPRmax were not significantly different
between IGT and diabetes (P = 0.204
and P = 0.965, respectively) (Fig. 3B
and C). For steady-state C-peptide and
ACPRmax, across the range of M/I the
responses were lower in those with di-
abetes versus IGT (both P , 0.001).
Supplementary Fig. 3A–C illustrates these
same relationships for C-peptide using
nontransformed data.
In consideration of insulin responses,
the slopes of log M/I versus log AIRg and
log AIRmax were significantly inversely
related (all P , 0.001) and did not differ
between the IGT and diabetes groups
(P = 0.633 and P = 0.757, respectively)
(Fig.3DandE).Theseparallelslopeswere
associated with reduced responses in
those with diabetesdlower across the
range of M/I for AIRg and AIRmax (P ,
0.001 for both). Supplementary Fig. 2D
and E presents these same relationships
plotted on the natural scale.
In summary, for youth and adults,
across the range of insulin sensitivity,
the acute and maximal C-peptide and
insulin responses and the steady-state
C-peptide response were greater in in-
dividuals with IGT compared with those
with diabetes.
Relationship of Fasting Glucose With
b-Cell Responses
As fasting glucose is associated with
the first-phase insulin response, we next
examined whether the relationship of
fasting glucose with ACPRg and AIRg
differed in youth and adults. As depicted
in Fig. 4A and B, the magnitude of both
ACPRg and AIRg declined as the fasting
glucose concentration increased, with the
response being markedly diminished in
those with a fasting glucose in the diabetes
range. A negative ACPRg was observed in
five youth and seven adults. The relation-
ships between fasting glucose and both
ACPRg and AIRg were significant in youth
(each P , 0.001) and adults (each P ,
0.001). The responses in youth were
greater than in adults across the range
of glucose concentration, even after ad-
justment for M/I (P , 0.001).
TheC-peptide and insulin responses to
arginine (ACPRmax and AIRmax) also de-
creased with increasing fasting glucose
(Fig. 4C and D). Unlike the first-phase
responses, these maximal responses
were still largely present, although di-
minished, in those with a fasting glucose
in the diabetes range. The inverse rela-
tionships between fasting glucose and
both log ACPRmax and log AIRmax were
significant in youth and adults (all P ,
0.001). The maximal responses in youth
were greater than in adults across the
range of fasting glucose concentration
and remained so after the difference in
M/I was accounted for (P , 0.001).
These observations indicate that even
after fasting glucose and insulin sensi-
tivity are accounted for, b-cells in youth
are more responsive to acute stimulation
with intravenous glucose or arginine than
are b-cells of adults.
Estimation of Insulin Clearance
in Youth Versus Adults and IGT
Versus Diabetes
The ratio of C-peptide to insulin was
calculated in the fasting state as an esti-
mate of insulin clearance. This ratio was
significantly lower in youth (Table 1),
suggesting lesser insulin clearance in
youth compared with adults. This differ-
ence in the ratio was not related to the
glucose concentration, being consistently
lower in youth across the fasting glucose
range (Fig. 4E). Insulin clearance was not
statistically different in people with IGT
or diabetes (Table 1 and Fig. 4F).
CONCLUSIONS
The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in
youth and adults has been examined
separately in cross-sectional studies
(6–9). RISE is the first large study that in-
cluded youth and adults and has applied
identical, sophisticated, and quantita-
tive methodologies including performance

 of all assays in a central laboratory, thereby
allowing direct comparisons of b-cell
function and insulin sensitivity between
youth and adults. Using this approach,
we report many novel observations that
advance our understanding of apparent
differences between youth and adults in
the progression of dysglycemia (10–12).
In RISE, insulin sensitivity in youth was
46% lower than in comparably over-
weight dysglycemic adults. Differences in

 (21,22) may explain some of this lower
insulin sensitivity in youth. Acute C-peptide
and insulin responses to glucose and
the nonglucose secretagogue arginine
were greater in youth, as well as greater
than required to compensate for mea-
sured differences in insulin sensitivity.
Interestingly, C-peptide concentrations
measured at a steady-state glucose
of ;11.1 mmol/L were also signifi-
cantly greater in youth than adults, but
the relative difference was smaller than
for the acute responses. These observations
suggest that in youth, the b-cell is hyper-
responsive to acute stimulation by glucose
and nonglucose (arginine) secretago-
gues, releasing greater amounts of C-
peptide and insulin from the readily
releasable pool (23). The difference in
response between groups is less evident
after prolonged glucose exposure, a con-
dition of continuous stimulation that is
more dependent on release of more
recently synthesized peptide (23). Our
findings arecompatiblewitharecentstudy
that used oral glucose tolerance test mod-
elingofpooleddataandshowedthatyouth
with impaired glucose metabolism were
insulin resistant with increased parameters
of b-cell responsiveness compared with
adults (24). In the same study, on the other
hand,youthandadultswithnormalglucose
tolerance or type 2 diabetes did not differ
for insulin sensitivity, while certain, but not
all, parameters of b-cell responsiveness
were greater in youth (24). Longitudinal
studies are necessary to determine whether
the changes in b-cell function and insulin
sensitivity over time differ in youth and
adults and whether they explain why the
disease appears to be more aggressive in
youth (10–12).
It has long been recognized that the
first-phaseinsulinresponsetointravenous
glucose decreases as the fasting glucose
concentration increases and that this re-
sponse is essentially absent in adults with
diabetes (25). In adults who are hypergly-
cemic, this calculated response can even
be negative (26). We have extended these
observations. First, across the range of
fasting glucose concentrations and after
adjustment for insulin sensitivity, the first-
phase response remains greater in youth
than adults, in keeping with b-cells of
youth responding more vigorously. Sec-
ond,wedescribeforthefirst timein youth
that negative first-phase responses occur,
aswithadults,insomeindividualswhoare
hyperglycemic. Third, for b-cell secretory
capacity (ACPRmax and AIRmax), there is an
inverse relationship with fasting glucose,
and these responses are greater in youth
than in adults. However, unlike the first-
phase response, in both youth and
adults, the responses to arginine at
maximal glycemic potentiation were
measurably greater than zero, even in
individuals with the highest fasting glu-
cose concentrations (9.6 mmol/L). This
difference in relationships between fas-
ting glucose and the acute responses to
glucose and arginine suggests that the
lack of a b-cell response to intravenous
stimulation is limited to glucose in both
age-groups. Further, it suggests the two
parameters are measuring different b-cell
characteristics.
Our data also suggest that the liver is
playing an important role in regulating
glucose homeostasis and that this effect
is different in the two age-groups, with a
lower fasting C-peptide–to–insulin ratio
in youth. This observation suggests that
hepatic insulin clearance is reduced in
youth, thus allowing a greater amount
ofinsulin toappearin theperiphery. We
can only provide conjecture on the gen-
esis of this difference. First, it seems likely
that there exists an as yet undefined
feedback system linking reduced periph-
eral insulin sensitivity with hepatic clear-
ance, and since youth with dysglycemia
have a marked reduction in insulin sen-
sitivity (24,27,28), this feedback mecha-
nism may be contributing to differences
in hepatic clearance. The consistent de-
crease in insulin clearance in youth com-
pared with adults across the range of
fasting glucose suggests that glucose is
not this putative factor. Second, it is
possible that a protective mechanism
exists that modulates hepatic extraction
in order to mitigate the increased work-
load on b-cells in circumstances of high
secretion, with differential actions in
youth and adults or in circumstances
of hypersecretion. It is known in adults that
hepatic glucose production is more sen-
sitive to insulin than is glucose utilization
by the peripheral tissues (29), but whether
this is also the case in youth is unclear.
Further work is warranted to explore
determinants or regulators of insulin
extraction in youth versus adults.
We observed parallel but shifted rela-
tionships between insulin sensitivity and
b-cell responses in IGT and diabetes, with
lower C-peptide and insulin responses in
those with diabetes. This is consistent with
the concept that hyperglycemia results
from impaired b-cell function in re-
cently diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Of
note, it is apparent in these data that
this difference in b-cell functionis not due
to differences in insulin clearance as we
observed in youth compared with adults.
There are some limitations to our
study. First, we did not directly quantify
body fat or its distribution to evaluate
possible contributions to the greater in-
sulin resistance in youth. Future assess-
ment of biomarkers of fat mass could
shed some light on this issue. Second, we
used the hyperglycemic clamp to simul-
taneously quantify b-cell responsiveness
and insulin sensitivity, but this approach
did not explore differences in tissue-spe-
cific responses to insulin between youth
and adults. Third, we used the fasting
C-peptide–to–insulin ratio as a surrogate
estimate of insulin clearance and did not
measure it directly. Fourth, we have fo-
cused on the two major b-cell products,
C-peptide and insulin; however, there are a
number of islet cell peptides of potential
interest that we did not measure such as
proinsulin,isletamyloidpolypeptide(IAPP),
or glucagon. Samples have been stored to
allow for the measurement of analytes such
as these should funding become available.
In conclusion, we found that youth
with IGT or recently diagnosed type 2
diabetes are markedly more insulin
resistant and have b-cells that are hyper-
responsive to acute stimulation compar-
ed with adults with a similar degree of
dysglycemia. Further, these b-cell re-
sponses in youth were enhanced even
after insulin sensitivity was accounted
for, suggesting that the workload their
b-cells are experiencing is greater than
that observed in adults. To the extent that
increased workload contributes to b-cell
decline (11,30), these findings may repre-
sent fundamental differences between
youth and adults in the pathogenesis of
type 2 diabetes or in the rates at which
diabetes develops and progresses. The
two groups also exhibited differences in
insulin clearance that may, in youth, be a
compensatory mechanism to provide suf-
ficient insulin to the peripheral tissues to
aid in appropriate and similar glucose
disposal while simultaneously reducing
secretory demand on the b-cell. Whether
these observed differences between
youth and adults will also result in differ-
ences in the response to the same medi-
cation interventions (metformin alone or
