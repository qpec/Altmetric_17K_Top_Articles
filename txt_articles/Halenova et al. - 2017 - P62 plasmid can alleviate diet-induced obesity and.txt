ABSTRACT
A high-calorie diet (HCD) induces two mutually exacerbating effects contributing to 
diet-induced obesity (DIO): impaired glucose metabolism and increased food consumption. 
A link between the metabolic and behavioral manifestations is not well understood yet. 
We hypothesized that chronic inflammation induced by HCD plays a key role in linking 
together the two components of diet-induced pathology. Based on this hypothesis, we 
tested if a plasmid (DNA vaccine) encoding p62 (SQSTM1) would alleviate DIO including 
its metabolic and/or food consumption abnormalities. Previously we reported that 
injections of the p62 plasmid reduce chronic inflammation during ovariectomy-induced 
osteoporosis. Here we found that the p62 plasmid reduced levels of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines IL-1β, IL-12, and INFγ and increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-
4, IL-10 and TGFβ in HCD-fed animals. Due to this anti-inflammatory response, we further 
tested whether the plasmid can alleviate HCD-induced obesity and associated metabolic 
and feeding impairments. Indeed, p62 plasmid significantly reversed effects of HCD 
on the body mass index (BMI), levels of glucose, insulin and glycosylated hemoglobin 
(HbA1c). Furthermore, p62 plasmid partially restored levels of the satiety hormone, 
serotonin, and tryptophan, simultaneously reducing activity of monoamine oxidase 
(MAO) in the brain affected by the HCD. Finally, the plasmid partially reversed increased 
food consumption caused by HCD. Therefore, the administering of p62 plasmid alleviates 
both metabolic and behavioral components of HCD-induced obesity.

INTRODUCTION
Obesity is regarded as one of the main medical 
problem of the XXI century: according to WHO data 
(2014), more than 1.9 billion people are overweight, and 
600 million are affected by obesity. In the US, obesity rate 
is currently 35%, compared to 15% in the early 80-s [1]. 
Obesity often leads to the development of type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) and comorbid diseases (metabolic syndrome) that 
provoke early disability and mortality. Despite numerous 
efforts, however, there is no real cure for obesity and other 
related diseases.
Experimental and clinical studies of recent years found 
that obesity is associated with accumulation of macrophages

(MF) and chronic inflammation of adipose tissue (AT) which 
affects its metabolic and secretory functions and plays a 
key role in obesity-related pathology [2, 3]. There are two 
major phenotypes of MF: pro-inflammatory, i.e. classically 
activated (M1) and anti-inflammatory, i.e. alternatively 
activated (M2). In animals feed with high-calorie diet, there 
is an increase both in the total number of MF in AT and 
sharp increase in fraction of M1-MF [4]; accordingly, M1-
MF also dominate in AT of patients with obesity or T2D [5]. 
Importantly, removal of M1-MF prevents development of 
diet-induced obesity [6, 7].
Chronic inflammation also has a central effect, in 
particular, by affecting serotonin levels whose release in 
the brain is among key factors in regulation of appetite [8] 
[9-11]. Decrease in the content of central serotonin under 
these conditions can lead to higher food consumption with 
subsequent hypersecretion of insulin, resulting in insulin 
resistance and obesity [11, 12].

We have recently developed p62 (SQSTM1)-
encoding plasmid (DNA vaccine) which demonstrated 
anti-cancer activity in animals models [13-15] and in 
the phase I/IIa clinical trial in patients with solid tumors 
[16]. p62 is a multifunctional protein which participates 
in selective autophagy and serves as a signaling hub for 
several signal transduction pathways, among them NF-
kB, TRAF6, MAP kinases, and NRF2 [17] [18, 19] [20] 
[21]. Various tissues (including AT) in obese animals 
and humans express less p62 than in non-obese [22] 
[23]. Furthermore, knockout of p62 led to mature-onset 
obesity and impaired glucose homeostasis in mice [24], 
and such effect of p62 knockout was apparently associated 
with increased activity of ERK in AT and fibroblasts 
[25]. Of note, knockout of p62 in MF promoted IL-1β 
accumulation caused by inflammasome activation [26].
We uncovered that the p62 plasmid, but not the 
empty vector, suppresses chronic inflammation during 
ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in mice [27]. Since 
chronic inflammation is believed to contribute to the 
development of obesity, we hypothesized that the p62 
plasmid can alleviate it as well as related systemic 
and brain metabolic impairments. Here we tested this 
hypothesis using a rat model of the diet-induced obesity.
RESULTS
p62 plasmid suppresses inflammatory cytokines 
induced by HCD
Obesity is considered to be a chronic and systemic 
inflammatory disease where AT overloaded with nutrients 
plays an important endocrine role through the production 
of adipokines [2]. Adipokines may activate innate 
immunity and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. 
This, in turn, can induce systemic inflammation that can 
cause insulin resistance and other metabolic syndromes. 
Considering beneficial effects of the p62 plasmid on 
ovariectomy-induced chronic inflammation [27], we 
explored whether this vaccine can alleviate inflammation 
in diet-induced obesity (DIO) model which is a common 
model for study of metabolic diseases. In our model, rats 
were fed with high calorie diet (HCD) which contained 
about 40% fat and almost 2-times more calories than 
standard diet (SD) (28.71 kJ/g vs 15.27 kJ/g). As we 
found previously, such diet profoundly affected glucose 
metabolism and led to pre-diabetic state [28].
To test the effect of the vaccine, rats fed with HCD 
were treated i.m. weekly for 6 weeks or left untreated 
whereas rats fed with SD served as control. In the end of 
the experiment (2 weeks after the last 6-th injection of the 
plasmid), the animals were sacrificed and their sera were 
collected for analysis of cytokines and other parameters.
We found a marked increase in the levels of pro-
inflammatory cytokines in HCD-fed rats comparing 
to SD-fed (control) rats: 1.83 fold in IFN-γ, 3.1-
fold in IL-1β, and 7-fold in IL-12 (Figure 1A-1C). 
Treatment of HCD-fed rats with the p62 plasmid led to 
a significantly lower production of all these cytokines: 
IFN-γ was reduced by 36%, IL-1β - 52%, and IL-12 – 
35% compared with the levels of HCD-fed untreated 
animals (Figure 1A-1C). Thus, the p62 plasmid partially 
normalized the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
increased by HCD.As to anti-inflammatory cytokines, 
there were no significant changes in IL-10 and TGFβ, 
but IL-4 levels were decreased by 12% in the HCD 
group compared to the SD group (Figure 2). Treatment 
of the HCD group with p62 plasmid increased levels 
of anti-inflammatory cytokines: IL-4 by 16%, IL-10 - 
57%, and TGFβ- 58% (Figure 2). Such increased levels

of anti-inflammatory cytokines in p62-treated animals 
fed with HCD may contribute to mitigation of chronic 
inflammation. Thus, the p62-plasmid may alleviate diet-
induced inflammation by both suppression of generation 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines and augmentation of anti-
inflammatory cytokines levels (Figures 1, 2).
p62 plasmid alleviates high calorie diet induced-
obesity and normalizes glucose homeostasis
Based on the effects of the p62 plasmid on chronic 
inflammation, we sought to test whether it can prevent the 
development of obesity and alleviate obesity-associated

metabolic disorder in our DIO model. To assess the 
development of the disease, we monitored body mass 
index (BMI), which reflects changes in body composition 
of experimental animals and extent of the deposition of fat 
mass. We found significant increase of BMI in the HCD 
group compared to the control group (from 0.71 to 0.80) 
that indicates the development of diet-induced obesity 
(Figure 3). Administration of the p62 plasmid resulted in 
a decrease of this parameter to 0.74. In SD-fed animals, 
the p62 plasmid did not show significant changes in BMI

compared to control (Figure 3). Therefore, the p62 plasmid 
can partially alleviate obesity caused by HCD.
Obesity usually leads to a pre-diabetic state, 
manifested, in particular, in insulin-resistance and impairment 
of glucose metabolism. Indeed, as depicted in Figure 4A, 
4B, HCD increased insulin and glucose levels as well as 
the levels of HbA1c (Figure 4C). Additionally, in an oral 
glucose tolerance test, there is a clear decrease in glucose 
consumption in HCD-fed rats (Figure 4D, Supplementary 
Figure 1). Thus, all these parameters demonstrate the 
development of the pre-diabetic state. Treatment with the p62 
plasmid led to a significant reversion of effects of HCD on 
serum insulin, glucose, and HbA1c levels: the concentration 
of glucose decreased by 22%, insulin - 30% (Figure 4A, 4B), 
 
and HbA1c - 34% (Figure 4C). Also, the p62 plasmid 
partially reversed glucose intolerance in HCD rats (Figure 4D, 
 
Supplementary Figure 1).
p62 plasmid increases brain serotonin and 
tryptophan levels in rats fed with HCD
The metabolism of brain serotonin, one of the 
key factors in feeling satiety, can be affected by obesity 
[10, 11]. Indeed, we found a significant decrease in the 
levels of serotonin and its metabolic precursor tryptophan 
in the brains of HCD-fed rats (1.8 times and 1.9 times, 
respectively) (Figure 5A, 5B). Treatment of the HCD-
fed rats with the p62 plasmid led to a partial restoration 
of these parameters (47% increase for serotonin, and 
48% - for tryptophan levels, Figure 5A, 5B). Activity of 
MAO (monoamine oxidase) involved in the degradation 
of serotonin increased almost 2-fold in obese rats but the 
p62 plasmid significantly (by 32%) suppressed MAO 
activity (Figure 5C). These results show a positive effect 
of the vaccine on serotonin metabolism in the brain of rats 
during DIO. We then analyzed the data on food (calories) 
consumption in the rats feed with HCD. As expected, 
these rats consumed many more calories than rats fed with 
a standard diet (Supplementary Figure 2). However, the 
p62 plasmid treatment normalized calorie consumption in 
DIO rats (Supplementary Figure 2)
DISCUSSION
Obesity leads to many dysfunctions: the imbalance 
in glucose metabolism observed in patients with obesity 
can provoke the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), 
whereas the imbalance in the protein and lipid metabolism 
can lead to cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the 
prevention and reversal of obesity is an urgent medical 
problem. Here we tested a novel approach to treat obesity: 
by weekly intramuscular administration of the plasmid 
(DNA vaccine) encoding p62 (SQSTM1) protein. In 
the DIO rat model this treatment decreased systemic 
generation of inflammatory cytokines, normalized 
glucose homeostasis and alleviated obesity (Figures 1-
4). The finding expands our previous observation that 
the p62 plasmid can alleviate chronic inflammation and 
bone pathology in rodent models of ovariectomy-induced 
osteoporosis [27].
The question arises of how a rather small amount 
(200 ug) of locally injected plasmid may have a systemic 
effect (on cytokines in blood), and remote effects, 
in particular, on AT and brain (i.e., on its serotonin 
metabolism). One of possibilities is that p62 plasmid acts 
as a plain DNA vaccine by generating immune response 
to the encoded antigen, p62, and thus damaging target 
tissue(s) where p62 is overexpresed (e.g. in tumors) [13, 
15, 29]. However, tissues including AT in obese animals 
express less p62 than in non-obese [22] [23], and p62 
knockout increases rather than decreases inflammation 
[30], therefore this possibility looks unlikely.
Figure 6: p62 plasmid disrupts “vicious circle” of diet-induced obesity. Metabolic disbalance induced by high calorie diet 
causes inflammation which can lead to reduced serotonin in the brain. This, in turn, can increase food consumption thus causing “vicious 
circle”. p62 plasmid apparently disrupts this circle by suppressing inflammation.

Instead, we suggest that the p62-encoding plasmid 
reduces chronic inflammation via modulation of the 
macrophage (MF) state by switching M1/M2 balance 
toward M2. This hypothesis is based on several sets of 
data: 1) proinflammatory M1-MF accumulate in AT 
during obesity, while their transformation to M2-MF 
aleviate obesity [4, 5, 31];2) plasmids can rather easily 
penetrate to bone marrow upon i.m. injection [32] [33] 
where AT-associated MF are generated from monocytes 
[34]; 3) monocytes (M0) and MF, in particular, M2-MF, 
can migrate from bone marrow to the sites of inflammation 
[35, 36]; 4) p62 overexpression in MF can inhibit their 
proinflammatory state (i.e. generation of proinflammatory 
cytokines) [37]. Thus, the administered p62 plasmid goes 
from the injection site to the bone marrow where it can 
transform M0 and/or M1-MF shifting them to M2-MF; 
then these M2-MF migrate to different tissues including 
AT where they alleviate inflammation, obesity and related 
pathologies.
We observed that HCD caused dysfunction of the 
serotonin pathway of tryptophan metabolism in the brain of 
rats: a decrease in the content of tryptophan and serotonin 
(Figure 5). Serotonin is a satiety hormone; reduced serotonin 
levels can lead to disruption of the serotonin-dependent 
regulation of feelings of satiety and the development of 
hyperphagia in obesity [10-12] [38]. Also, we recorded 
increased activity of monoamine oxidase, an enzyme which 
metabolizes and reduces serotonin levels, in the brain of rats of 
DIO group (Figure 5). The excessive uptake of nutrients from 
food, particularly free amino acids, may lead to an imbalance 
in the central dopamine and serotonin systems, which causes 
development of hyperphagia thus creating a positive feedback 
loop between mental and metabolic dysfunctions (Figure 6). 
Chronic inflammation can be a link forming such “vicious 
circle” of obesity: HCD consumption disrupts the metabolism; 
metabolic dysfunction causes chronic inflammation; chronic 
inflammation leads to a reduced serotonin level, and reduced 
serotonin level further causes higher HCD consumption o 
(Figure 6). Indeed, there are several reports that systemic 
inflammatory cytokines and local MF (microglia) can affect 
brain serotonin metabolism by decreasing its levels [9] [39].
Dysfunction of the serotonergic system is the basis 
for the development of a number of pathological conditions 
and mental disorders possessing comorbidities with 
metabolic syndromes and T2D, including schizophrenia, 
various psychoses, anxiety and depression [40]. Depression 
often increases food consumption which leads to obesity 
[41]. As we described above, DIO in turn disrupts the 
serotonin system, which closes the circle: insufficient 
serotonin level causes depression; depression can lead to 
the increased calorie consumption; excessive calories cause 
systemic inflammation, and inflammation can further reduce 
serotonin levels (Figure 6). Thus, not only the metabolic and 
behavioral components of DIO can aggravate each other 
forming a positive feedback loop, but also metabolic and 
mental disorders may be mutually exacerbating.
We found that the p62 plasmid can apparently break 
this cycle: in addition to normalizing metabolic parameters 
it also partially normalized parameters of brain serotonin 
metabolism impaired by HCD (Figure 5) and reduced 
calorie uptake (Supplementary Figure 2). We suggest 
that such increase in brain serotonin levels in DIO rats 
treated with the p62 plasmid is a secondary effect to the 
suppression of inflammation. Thus, reducing chronic 
inflammation, the p62 plasmid can break the “vicious 
cycle” of obesity alleviating both metabolic and behavioral 
components of HCD -induced obesity (Figure 6).
To our knowledge, this is the first report that a DNA 
vaccine can alleviate diet-induced chronic inflammation, 
metabolic dysfunctions and weight gain. The main focus 
of future research should be revealing the mechanism by 
which the p62 plasmid suppresses chronic inflammation 
that is involved in a range of diseases besides obesity [42, 
43]. Also, recent reports about the role of MAO in tumor 
metastasis [44, 45] make it interesting to test whether 
inhibition of MAO contributes to an anti-metastatic effect 
of the p62 plasmid which we observed in mice [13].
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and diets
The experiments were conducted in 5-weeks old 
Wistar male rats with initial weight of 135-140 g. The 
animals were housed and handled in animal facility after 
approval of scientific council of T. Shevchenko Kiev 
National University according to EU Directive 2010/63/
EU for animals. The animals of each experimental group 
were housed in polypropylene cages in an environmentally 
controlled clean air rooms. They were adapted for a week 
and feed with a SD (standard diet) consisting of 6.7% 
fat, 21% protein and 55.1% of carbohydrate (15.27 kJ/g, 
Laboratory Rodent Diet #5001, LabDiet ) and water ad 
libitum and then the rats were divided in two matched 
groups: control (continued to be fed with a SD) and fed 
with HCD (high calorie diet) consisted of 60% of a SD 
with 10% of pork fat, 10% eggs, 9% sucrose, 5% peanuts, 
5% dry milk, 1% of vegetable oil (38.8% total fat, 28.71 
kJ/g) [28]. Calorie consumption was calculated per each 
cage (5 rats) per day based on daily food consumption.
p62 plasmid treatment
Human p62 (Sqstm1) – encoding DNA vaccine was 
described elsewhere [13, 27] and produced using EndoFree 
Plasmid Giga Kit (Qiagen). Three weeks after feeding with 
a SD or HCD, half of the animals from each group were 
randomly selected and subjected to the treatment with the 
p62 plasmid which was intramuscular injected in femoral 
quadriceps with 200 ug (100 ul) per rat once a week for 6 
weeks; another half did not receive injections. Thus, there 
were 4 experimental groups: 1) control (SD) -10 animals; 
 Oncotarget
56038
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
2) control+p62 – 10 animals; 3) HCD – 15 animals; and 4) 
HCD+p62 plasmid – 15 animals). We did not use empty 
vector (pcDNA3.1) as a control to save animals since in 
our previous studies the empty vector, similar to saline, did 
not have any effects on inflammation [27] or tumor growth 
[13]. Body mass index (weight (g)/lenght2 (cm)) and other 
parameters were measured at the end of experiment (on 
11th week, i.e. 2 weeks after the last 6th injection of p62 
plasmid).
Biochemical analyses
A serum was obtained from tail vein and assessed 
for glucose level via glucose-oxidase method utilizing 
Glucophot-II glucometer (Ukraine). Animals were 
fasting for 6 hr prior to the blood sampling. Glycosylated 
hemoglobin was measured spectrophotometrically with 
“Pliva-lachema Diagnostika” (Chech Republick) assay kit.
Serum insulin and cytokines (interferon gamma, 
TGF and interleukins 1-beta, 4, 10 and 12) were quantified 
by ELISA immune assays with primary and secondary 
antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA. 
The data were normalized by serum protein which was 
measured by Bradford assay.
Oral glucose tolerance test
Before the test, animals fasting for 6 hr were 
anesthetized by an i.p. injection of thiopental sodium, 
at a dose of 40 mg/kg, and glucose (3 g/kg in 2 ml) was 
administered per os. Blood samples (100 ul) were taken 
via an i.v. catheter from tail vein before the test and at 30, 
60, 90, 120, 150 min after the administration of glucose; 
serum glucose concentration was determined as described 
above. Based on the test results, the glycemic curve was 
depicted and area under the curve (AUC) calculated.
Assay of serotonin, tryptophan and monoamine 
oxidase
Brain homogenates from fasting for 6 hr 
and 
euthanized 
animals 
were 
prepared 
using 
homogenization medium containing 50 mM Tris-acetate 
buffer, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA and 10% sucrose with the 
tissue:buffer ratio of 1:10 (w/w). The homogenates were 
centrifuged for 20 min at 1500 g. All the procedures 
were carried out at +4ºC. The resulting supernatant 
was used to measure the concentrations of serotonin, 
tryptophan and MAO (monoamine oxidase) activity as 
described before [38]. Briefly, serotonin and tryptophan 
were quantified using ion-exchange chromatography 
on KM-Sepharose with subsequent measurement of 
fluorescence of tryptophan (at excitation at 359 nm 
and absorption at 485 nm), and serotonin (excitation 
295 nm and absorption 550 nm). MAO activity of the 
brain was assayed using kinuramine dihydrobromide as 
a substrate by measuring fluorescence of its product, 
4-hydroxyquinoline, at excitation at 315 nm and 
absorption at 380 nm as described [38].
Statistical analysis
Data shown are means+/-SEM. p-values were 
calculated using Kruskal-Wallis tests and the successive 
post hoc Conover-Iman tests if not mentioned otherwise; 
p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analysis 
was performed using the R software.
