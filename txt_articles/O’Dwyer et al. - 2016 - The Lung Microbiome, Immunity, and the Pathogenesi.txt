 The Lung Microbiome, Immunity, and the Pathogenesis of
Chronic Lung Disease
David N. O’Dwyer,* Robert P. Dickson,* and Bethany B. Moore*,†
The development of culture-independent techniques
for microbiological analysis has uncovered the previ-
ously unappreciated complexity of the bacterial micro-
biome at various anatomic sites. The microbiome of
the lung has relatively less bacterial biomass when com-
pared with the lower gastrointestinal tract yet displays
considerable diversity. The composition of the lung
microbiome is determined by elimination, immigration,
and relative growth within its communities. Chronic
lung disease alters these factors. Many forms of chronic
lung disease demonstrate exacerbations that drive disease
progression and are poorly understood. Mounting evi-
dence supports ways in which microbiota dysbiosis can
influence host defense and immunity, and in turn may
contribute to disease exacerbations. Thus, the key to un-
derstanding the pathogenesis of chronic lung disease may
reside in deciphering the complex interactions between
the host, pathogen, and resident microbiota during stable
disease and exacerbations. In this brief review we discuss
new insights into these labyrinthine relationships.

Journal of Immunology, 2016, 196: 4839–4847.
T
he microbiome is defined as the “ecological community
of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic organisms
that share our body space” (1). Most studies of host
and microbiome interaction in the human have focused al-
most exclusively on bacteria, biotic factors, and the host.
These complex communities of microbiota that inhabit en-
vironments such as the lung, skin, or gut are now appreci-
ated for their role in maintaining organ, tissue, and immune
homeostasis. One striking example is the early observation
that germ-free mice have absent/impaired secondary lym-
phoid architecture with resulting loss of lymphoid cells (2).
Additionally, commensal microbiota can have both systemic
and site-specific autonomous immune effects. For example,
Staphylococcus epidermidis colonization of the skin promotes
CD4 cell IFN-g production, which protects against infection
with the parasite Leishmania major. In contrast, colonization of
the gut with S. epidermidis had no effect (3). In other situations,
it is well established that alterations of the gut microbiome can
influence immune responses at distal sites. Antibiotic treatment,
which disrupts gut microbiota accompanied by increases in
fungal colonization, can greatly exaggerate the allergic response
to intranasal challenge with the mold spore Aspergillus fumigatus.
With antibiotic treatment, mice showed increased levels of eo-
sinophils, mast cells, IL-5, IL-13, IFN-g, IgE, and mucus-
secreting cells (4). More recently, modulation of gut micro-
biota through the use of probiotics has been shown to increase
the frequency of B cells expressing IgA in the colon and lymph
nodes, likely secondary to increased lymph node T follicular
helper cells and IL-23–expressing dendritic cells (5), all changes
that are likely to improve host defense at mucosal sites or re-
sponse to vaccination. Conversely, antibiotic treatment can limit
development of T follicular helper cells (6). The response of
pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune
response in the lung is well described. We know that defective
components of the innate response can predispose to over-
whelming infection and mortality and in some cases reduce in-
jury from pathogens (7–9). The relationship between resident
microbiota and this flagship innate response and the subsequent
adaptive immune response in the lung is poorly understood.
With this backdrop, we have chosen to explore what is known
about the potential role of the microbiota (both gut and lung)
and host interaction in regulating the pathogenesis of several
important lung diseases.
Origins of lung microbiome and debunking lung sterility
The lung is an organ constantly exposed to microbiota either
through inhalation or subclinical microaspiration from birth.
Historically, medical texts allude to a sterile lung environment,
and this dogma has persisted in contemporary medicine. In the
last decade, a revolution of sorts has taken place in our un-
derstanding of how the lung and microbiota interact and exist.
This revolution stems from new knowledge that the lung is
not sterile (10) and, in fact, harbors an abundance of diverse
interacting microbiota. As mentioned above, the gut microbiome
modulates host mucosal defense (11, 12); however, there is a
paucity of information regarding the potential role of lung
microbiota to regulate immunity and homeostasis.

 The lung is not sterile, contrary to centuries of dogma
asserting the same. Throughout the 1900s this inference was
reinforced by respiratory culture-based protocols that sought
only to identify clinically significant pathogens and by a spurious
conclusion that upper respiratory tract microbes cultured from
the lung represented contamination (10). The lung is a warm
environment exposed to 7000 l of diverse microbe-ridden air
every day (13). Microbes adapt and exist in hostile environ-
ments similar to polar ice sheets of Antarctica and hot sulfur
springs of Japan, yet the idea the human lung existed in a sterile
state was “cultivated” in the medical literature for decades (14,
15). The upper respiratory tract and oropharynx, where mi-
crobes are found in abundance (16), is in direct communica-
tion with the lung, and subclinical aspiration of oropharyngeal
contents occurs universally in humans (17, 18). Thus, the lung
is subject to a constant level of microbe immigration and
elimination through host mucosal defense and mucociliary
clearance. Modern studies employing sequence-based bacterial
identification techniques support the presence of a consistently
detected diverse bacterial signal in the lung of healthy humans
(19–22). Therefore, the notion of lung sterility has been
debunked.
This new understanding was animated by the discovery of
culture-independent techniques for bacterial identification.
The most commonly used approach involves high-throughput
sequencing of amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene, a highly
conserved locus in the bacterial genome. Sequences are
then categorized and classified according to publically available
prior knowledge taxonomic databases to allow for measures of
total and relative abundance and diversity. The first appli-
cation of culture-independent techniques was undertaken in
a cohort of healthy controls and asthma patients. Hilty et al.
(20) reported that healthy airways contain bacteria similar
to, but distinct from, the upper respiratory tract, and air-
ways of asthma patients were enriched with the phylum
Proteobacteria.
Sampling the lung for microbiome sequencing is technically
challenging given the relatively low biomass. Furthermore,
sampling lower airways by bronchoscopy requires passage of
the instrument through the oral or nasal route. This course
allows for a theoretical risk of pharyngeal contamination of
samples. Importantly, the mouth and nose microbiota are
markedly different and studies have not identified any de-
tectable influence on the reported microbiota based on scope
insertion site (22, 23). Additionally, if pharyngeal carryover
from the bronchoscope insertion site was heavily influencing
the reported microbiota, then serial dilutions of samples should
result in dilution of bacterial communities and signal. Several
studies have established that this is not the case (19, 24). The
evidence thus supports minimal contamination from pharyn-
geal sources acquired by bronchoscopic methods.
Methodology and limitations in studies of the microbiota
Accurate and relevant studies of the microbiome require con-
sideration of several principles. Representative samples must be
acquired from the distal airways, and, as discussed above, the
possibility of contamination from other niche microbiota
must be addressed. Furthermore, contamination can occur
during sample processing; use of “no template” controls is es-
sential in low-biomass studies to assess the effects of reagent
contamination. The extraction of nucleic acid requires lysis of
species, some of which are more susceptible to cell disruption
than others. This discrepancy can lead to overrepresentation of
some species over others. Further steps that may alter the ac-
curacy and reliability of acquired data include the generation of
appropriate PCR primers, data normalization, the choice of
reference database, and divergent measures of diversity (25). The
use of 16S rRNA sequencing remains a pillar step in the sample
processing; however, 16S rRNA sequencing may not be able to
differentiate between species with varying immunogenicity and
pathogenicity (26). The microbiome is subject to a number of
factors that are known to change its composition, including age,
diet, ethnicity, and study design, and in humans requires careful
management of these potential influences (27–29). However, in
tandem, researchers are developing novel and ingenious methods
to limit any possible error in microbiome studies. For example,
as an alternate process to 16S rRNA sequencing and primer
choice, metagenomic data are being generated through the
sequencing of all DNA from a sample (shotgun sequencing),
which may be even more informative (30). Culture-based
techniques remain highly relevant as complements to culture-
independent techniques in determination of viability, in spe-
ciation, and in microbial phenotyping.
Microbiome development and composition in healthy lung
The human microbiota inhabits several organs and is pri-
marily colonized by six phyla: Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes,
Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Cyanobacteria
(31–34). Murine studies have demonstrated that bacterial load
in the lungs increases during the first 2 wk of life, and the phyla
of organisms found in the lung shifted from Gammaproteo-
bacteria and Firmicutes toward Bacteriodetes (35). Such
developmental changes in the microbiota were associated with
accumulation of a PD-L1–dependent T regulatory cell population
that could promote tolerance to allergen challenge (35). These
data suggest that acquisition of a lung microbiome is an impor-
tant early life event necessary to protect the lung from injurious
responses to inhaled Ags. In humans, studies have largely focused
on gut microbiota and shown that newborns acquire microbiota
that resembles their mother quickly and in a manner specific to
the method of delivery. Dominguez-Bello et al. (36) reported that
infants born by vaginal delivery acquired bacterial commu-
nities resembling their mother’s vaginal microbiota, dominated
by Lactobacillus, Prevotella, or Sneathia species. Infants born
by cesarean section acquired skin-predominant Staphylococcus,
Corynebacterium, and Propionibacterium species. These com-
munities were undifferentiated across multiple body habitats in
the infants, in contrast to the diverse communities evident in the
mothers. No studies to date have examined the dynamic changes
that may occur in the lower respiratory tract microbiota as
childhood progresses. However, it is likely from studies of the
upper respiratory tract and intestinal microbiota that these bac-
terial communities are dynamic (37, 38). There is relatively low
bacterial biomass in the human lung. Bacterial loads from
bronchoalveolar lavage have reported ranges from 4.5 to 8.25 log
copies/ml (39, 40). Further analysis of lung tissue samples dem-
onstrates some 10–100 bacterial cells per 1000 human cells (41).
The healthy lung has been studied using culture-independent
techniques, and the predominant phyla are Bacteroidetes and
Firmicutes (21, 24). Although individuals exhibit some spatial
variation in the microbiota of their respiratory tract, intrasubject
variation is significantly less than that of intersubject variation (39).

 Dynamic changes in lung microbiome in health and disease
The lung is a relatively low nutrient resource compared with
the intestinal tract for supporting microbiome development.
Furthermore, physiological conditions are regionally variable
even in healthy lungs. Conditions that affect bacterial pro-
liferation include oxygen tension, blood flow, local pH,
temperature, effector inflammatory cell disposition, and
epithelial cell architecture (42, 43). Coupled to this variable
biogeography of the lung microbiome are the factors that
influence microbe immigration and elimination from the
lower respiratory tract. Taken together, these factors de-
termine the dynamic change of the microbial ecosystem of
the lung.
Lung disease alters the population dynamics through
effects on immigration/elimination and the local conditions
of the microbial ecosystem of the lung (Table I). Chronic
lung disease in many forms results in heterogeneous ar-
chitectural distortion of the lung, including upper lobe
predominant destruction of the terminal bronchioles in
emphysema and lower lobe predominant distortion of the
parenchyma by honeycombing in idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis (IPF) (44). Changes in the viscosity of the mucus
and pH occur in cystic fibrosis (CF) (45). The resultant
changes in oxygen tension, ventilation, perfusion, inflam-
matory cells, and other local factors exert pressure on
population dynamics. Immigration of microbiota from the
upper respiratory to the lower respiratory tract is primarily
promoted by subclinical aspiration, which occurs in both
health and disease, and overt clinical infection occurs when
local defense is blunted or overwhelmed (17, 18). Chronic
lung disease is commonly associated with gastroesophageal
reflux, which may result in elevated volumes of microaspiration
(46, 47). Elimination is achieved by cough and mucociliary
clearance. Host inflammatory cells are responsible for
eradication of pathogens, and the type and number of
effector cells are associated with certain features of the
microbiome. In a comparison of inflammatory cells and
microbiota detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, Segal
et al. (24) demonstrated increased community abundance
of Prevotella and Veillonella species (common anaerobic
oral commensals) associated with higher levels of lymphocyte
and neutrophil inflammation. Therefore, the lung microbiome
has a potential role to play in the pathogenesis of chronic
lung disease through both the ability of lung microbiota
to modulate local inflammatory responses and the in-
fluence of chronic lung diseases on the lung microbiome
in turn.
Chronic lung diseases include asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), CF, and IPF. Interestingly, these
diseases are all characterized by natural histories that are punc-
tuated by periods of acute exacerbations. Exacerbations are
characterized by acute worsening of pulmonary symptoms and a
decline in pulmonary function. Such exacerbations are respon-
sible for significant mortality and morbidity. The onset of ex-
acerbation may herald accelerated disease progression, and many
patients fail to return to their previous functional and physio-
logical baselines (48). Studies of these events may reveal key data
that reanimate our current understanding of the pathogenesis of
chronic lung disease, and it is likely that these exacerbations are
accompanied or induced by microbiota dysbiosis.
COPD. The relationship between COPD exacerbation and
acute bacterial infection of the airway remains disputed. Po-
tential pathogens cultured from sputum during COPD ex-
acerbations are less frequently cultured during periods of
clinical stability (49). Sethi et al. (50) identified similar cul-
ture densities of Haemophilus influenzae and lower densities
of Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae in
sputum collected during acute exacerbations compared with
samples during clinical stability. The use of antibiotic therapy
in COPD exacerbations also lacks clarity. Recent work
reported a clear role in reducing the rate of treatment failure
for severe disease in hospitalized patients, but the role is un-
clear for mild to moderate disease (51). Culture-independent
techniques have identified a diverse and abundant pulmonary
microbiota in exacerbations from a variety of sampling types
(41, 52–54), and exacerbations are definitively associated with
changes in respiratory microbiota and airway inflammation.
Millares et al. (52) analyzed sputum from COPD patients
during exacerbations with paired sampling from periods of
clinical stability and found increases in the relative abundance
of bacteria associated with exacerbations, namely Haemophilus,
Pseudomonas, and Moraxella. Huang et al. (53) reported an
alteration in community content toward the Proteobacteria
phylum during COPD exacerbations, including nontypical
COPD pathogens. Additionally, the influence of viral exposure
may trigger COPD exacerbations (55) but the relationship
between viral infection, microbiome composition, and host
defense is poorly understood. Patients experimentally infected
with rhinovirus develop clinical features of COPD exacerbation,
and culprit viruses have been isolated in respiratory samples
from 36 to 56% of patients with exacerbations versus 6–19%
of patients at clinical baseline (56–59). Interestingly, Molyneaux
et al. (60) compared sputum in COPD patients at baseline
and during exacerbations and noted that sputum acquired
after viral exposure demonstrated a shift toward the
Proteobacteria phylum, a potential explanation for the
Table I.

 increased presence of Pseudomonas spp. noted in COPD
exacerbations (52). Sequencing-based studies of tissue
from COPD patients have demonstrated an increase in
the Firmicutes community in severe disease (GOLD stage
4) attributable to an increase in the Lactobacillus genus (41).
Phagocytosis of Lactobacillus spp. by human macrophages
reduces the effects of cigarette smoke–related inflammation,
potentially suggesting that these species are beneficial modifiers
of smoking-related lung disease (61). Animal models of
respiratory syncytial virus infection have demonstrated
that the antiviral response within the lung mucosa can
be modulated by the administration of Lactobacillus
rhamnosus species prior to infection (62). Thus, changes
in the microbiome may represent an adaptation to try
to protect the lung from respiratory viral infection. However,
we speculate that, as suggested above, once pathogenic
infection does occur, these beneficial changes may be
lost.
Asthma. Studies of airway microbiota in asthma have estab-
lished that composition is altered when compared with con-
trols. Hilty et al. (20) identified asthma patients with more
frequent Proteobacteria (particularly Haemophilus) in the
bronchial tree compared with controls. The authors also
noted a decrease in Bacteroidetes, especially Prevotella species,
in asthmatic airways. Studies of asthma severity identified
similar altered microbiomes with a predominance of
Proteobacteria and found that the airway microbiome of
asthmatic patients was more diverse that of nonasthmatic
controls (63). Huang et al. (64) reported an association between
bronchial hyperresponsiveness and community diversity and
composition, secondary to an increased abundance of
Proteobacteria. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness is accentuated
during exacerbation and is an accurate predictor of future
exacerbations (65). Alterations to the microbiome appear
similar in both mild and severe disease and are specifically
associated with features of the disease. No studies have
analyzed the airway microbiome in asthma exacerbations.
However, an estimated 80% of asthma exacerbations are
associated with viral infection (66, 67). The host microbiome
interaction may be crucial in the development of asthma.
Ege et al. (68) have demonstrated that children with broad
microbial exposures (i.e., traditional farming) were protected
from asthma and atopy in childhood. Further studies reported
an association with high-fiber diet and a reduced risk of asthma
(69). The proposed mechanism was related, in part, to an
altered immune response. Mice fed a low-fiber diet exhibited
reduced levels of short-chain fatty acids with increased allergic
inflammation, whereas mice with a high-fiber diet had elevated
levels of short-chain fatty acids and were protected against
allergic inflammation. Short-chain fatty acid propionate
treatment of mice resulted in the generation of macrophages
and dendritic cells with enhanced phagocytic properties but
an attenuated capacity to initiate a Th2 response, a crucial
component of allergic inflammation (69). Furthermore, studies
have suggested that resident microbiota may promote Th17-
dependent neutrophil inflammation in a murine model of
OVA-induced asthma (70). Similarly, an experimental model of
allergic airway inflammation is exacerbated by the administration
of antibiotics during early life. This correlated with a reduction in
microbial load and diversity (71).
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. IPF is a chronic fatal remodeling
disease of the lung parenchyma of unknown etiology (72). The
natural history of IPF is characterized by exacerbations that
contribute greatly to disease-related morbidity and mortality.
Recent work has highlighted a potential role for both viral and
bacterial infection in the pathogenesis of IPF (73–77). Unlike
with asthma or COPD, the current definition of acute
exacerbations of IPF excludes active infectious pathogens (78).
Disease progression in IPF is characterized by an alteration in the
microbiome with a relative increased abundance of Streptococcus
and Staphylococcus taxonomic groups (79). This has particular
relevance given recent work identifying pneumolysin, a
Pneumococcus-produced toxin, that mediates fibrotic progression
in animal models via injury of the alveolar epithelium (73).
Further study by Molyneaux et al. (76) described an increased
bacterial burden in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of IPF
patients compared with controls using culture-independent
techniques. These communities were enriched with Haemophilus,
Streptococcus, Neisseria, and Veillonella. The greater the bacterial
burden in these patients, the greater the independent association
with IPF disease progression. Recent trials of trimethoprim/
sulfamethoxazole have demonstrated benefit with improved
Medical Research Council dyspnea scores, quality of life, and
even all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence
interval, 0.06–0.78; p = 0.02) (80). This further supports a
role for bacterial burden in disease progression. Aspects of host
defense and innate immunity also have putative roles in IPF
disease progression (81–86). We have previously suggested that
defective TLR3 signaling promotes IPF disease progression (81).
The L412F polymorphism (rs3775291) of TLR3 results in a
functional defect in primary lung fibroblasts from IPF
patients. This defect leads to aberrant inflammation and
blunted IFN responses to TLR3 activation by synthetic dsRNA
(and likely pathogen-associated molecular patterns, although
this was not directly examined). Genotyping studies of two
independent cohorts of IPF patients confirmed an association
between this polymorphism with increased mortality and
functional decline. However, the interaction between the
pulmonary microbiome, host defense, acute infection, and
IPF disease progression remains unclear. Ultimately, the
questions of whether chronic lung disease promotes microbiome
alterations or microbiome changes modify chronic lung disease
remain to be answered.
Cystic fibrosis. The manifestations of CF in the lung involve the
progressive development of bronchiectasis and obstructive
lung disease. Central to disease progression are exacerbations
of CF bronchiectasis, which are responsible for significant
mortality, morbidity, and accelerated disease progression (87).
Exacerbations of disease are attributed to infection by specific
pathogens that are cultured from sputum during exacerba-
tions and clinical stability. These pathogens commonly in-
clude Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (88).
The evidence to support the use of antibiotics directed against
these pathogens is sparse. The bacterial density of sputum is
not altered during CF exacerbations when antibiotics are
administered (89). Clinical trials have not reported an asso-
ciation between the clinical response during antibiotic therapy
and the in vitro susceptibility of the cultured bacteria to
the administered antibiotics (90, 91). Indeed, culture-
independent analysis has primed a revision of our long-held
understanding of the bacterial pathogenesis of CF lung
4842

 disease. Studies have consistently reported that CF exacerbations
are not associated with increased bacterial density or attenuated
diversity (92–94). However, evidence would support a loss of
diversity with increasing age and disease severity, which was
strongly associated with cumulative antibiotic exposure (95,
96). The emergence of new pathogens may have implications
for our understanding of the microbiome and lung disease
interaction in CF. Nontuberculosis Mycobacterium, in particular
M. abscessus, is associated with increased mortality and
morbidity in CF (97–99). Guidelines for the management of
M. abscessus have been published, and long-term treatment with
broad-spectrum antibiotics is required in these cases (100). The
consequences for the lung microbiome for this treatment remain
unknown. This is of particular relevance given the limited
treatment benefit for M. abscessus infection in CF (100). The
relationship between the microbiome, antibiotic exposure,
exacerbation, and ultimate disease progression will thus
require further careful study in CF.
Evidence and implications for a gut/lung axis and the regulation of
host defense for chronic lung disease exacerbations
Exactly how microbiota may regulate innate immunity in
health and disease is an area of active investigation, and very
little is known about how the lung microbiota may specifically
regulate lung immunity or the development of bronchial-
associated lymphoid tissue. There is growing appreciation
for the fact that the gut commensal microbiota is an impor-
tant regulator of the innate immune system (101, 102). The
bacterial biomass of the intestine dwarfs the relative mass seen
in the lung (103). In healthy adults the intestine microbiota
consists predominantly of three phyla: Bacteroides, Prevotella,
and Ruminococcus (104). There is evidence to support a
crucial early period during life where intestinal microbiome
development is important for the regulation of an appro-
priate immune response in the lung. CF and asthma are
examples of chronic lung disease where disease course and
susceptibility are influenced by shifts in the composition of
the gut microbiota (105, 106). Furthermore, in the absence
of normal gut biota, the host is more susceptible to pul-
monary infections, including Listeria monocytogenes (107),
Klebsiella pneumoniae (108), and viruses (109). This raises
the interesting possibility that exacerbations of chronic lung
disease may arise from impaired innate and adaptive im-
mune function secondary to alterations in the host gut
microbiota. As mentioned above, patients with progressive
IPF show evidence of enhanced burden of Streptococcus and
Staphylococcus species in the lung, and previous studies have
shown that the ability of neutrophils from microbiota-
depleted mice to kill S. pneumoniae and S. aureus are reduced
(110). It is not known at present whether the accumulation of
these species in the lung correlates with loss of gut microbial
communities during IPF disease progression, but this is an
interesting area for future study (Fig. 1). Support for such a
concept comes from recent work showing that bacterial acti-
vation of Nod-like receptors in the gut leads to enhanced
production of reactive oxygen species within alveolar macro-
phages, the sentinel innate immune cell within the lung (101),
implying that conditions associated with loss of gut bacterial
homeostasis (e.g., antibiotic use) could provide a window of
opportunity for lung immunity to be impaired. In COPD,
exacerbations can occur due to viral infections (60, 111), and
resulting pathogenesis could be the result of dysbiosis leading to
altered airway microbiota and disproportionate inflammation.
Although loss of gut commensal signaling may impair lung
innate immunity in this disorder, cigarette smoke directly and
indirectly contributes to impaired innate immunity in the lung
via alterations in ciliary function, mucus, innate immune cell
phagocytosis, and via direct enhancement of bacterial virulence
(e.g., enhanced biofilm formation) (reviewed in Ref. 112).
These changes could impact the ability of respiratory pathogens
to exacerbate COPD.
Given the propensity for viruses to precipitate lung disease
exacerbations, it is interesting to note the potential impact of
respiratory viral infection on the intestinal microbiota. Wang
et al. (113) reported that influenza infection may lead to alter-
ations in intestinal microbiota with a reduction in Lactobacillus
and Lactococcus and an outgrowth of Enterobacteriaceae. As
noted above, this may lead to a loss of beneficial microbiota for
smoking-related disease. The authors demonstrated that these
shifts in intestinal microbiota were not secondary to lytic influ-
enza gut infection. This injury was mediated by Th17 cells, and
IL-17 neutralization resulted in attenuated injury. Additionally,
antibiotic-mediated depletion of intestinal microbiota led to at-
tenuated intestinal injury. Interestingly, this study also high-
lighted the importance of an effector T cell that arose in the lung
after infection and then migrated to the small intestine to pro-
vide IFN-g to alter the gut microbiome. Ultimately the alter-
ations in the gut microbiota stimulated epithelial-derived IL-15
to promote the Th17 response. It is possible that IL-17 responses
arising in the gut may further impact lung disease (114). IL-17 is
involved in the elimination of certain pathogens (115) and is
implicated in the pathogenesis of several pulmonary pathologies
including asthma, sarcoidosis, obliterative bronchiolitis, CF, and
bone marrow transplant–related pneumonitis (116–120).
IL-17 may also play a central role in the dynamic change that
occurs within the pulmonary microbiota of COPD. Yadava
et al. (121) reported the impact of experimental change on the
lung microbiota in an emphysema animal model. Specific
pathogen-free and axenic mice were challenged with LPS/
elastase for 4 wk. Microbiota diversity and abundance was
decreased in the LPS/elastase model with an abundance of
Pseudomonas, Lactobacillus, and a depletion of Prevotella. Loss
of bacterial load was associated with attenuated IL-17 pro-
duction. The intranasal application of microbiota-enriched
fluid to axenic mice enhanced IL-17 production. The neutral-
ization of IL-17 in mice harboring microbiota led to dampened
inflammation and reduced disease burden. Several studies have
implicated IL-17 in hepatic fibrosis, and certain experimental
models of pulmonary fibrosis are IL-17A–dependent (120, 122,
123). Furthermore, studies examining the development of in-
testinal fibrosis have reported an association with alterations in
the microbiota and Th17 responses (124). The intestine is a
known source of Th17 cells through binding of segmented
filamentous bacteria to intestinal epithelial cells (125). The case
may be similar in the lung. Gauguet et al. (126) have demon-
strated that intestinal segmented filamentous bacteria have the
ability to promote pulmonary innate immunity through the
induction of IL-17 to provide resistance to S. aureus pneumonia
in animal models. This constitutes further evidence to support a
gut/lung microbiome axis that may be pivotal in modulating
the innate immune response of the lung. However, direct evi-
dence of a gut/lung axis promoting exacerbation of chronic lung

 disease is limited to experimental data to date and requires
further study.
Conclusions
Growing evidence suggests that alterations in the lung and/or
gut microbiota characterize chronic lung diseases and may
allow for exacerbations caused by endogenous microbiota al-
terations or susceptibility to new infection (Fig. 1). We spec-
ulate that impairment in lung innate immunity caused by
microbial dysbiosis may promote susceptibility of the host to
infections that can exacerbate chronic lung diseases. Further-
more, shifts in cytokine profiles mediated by changes in the
microbiota may also promote epithelial injury and fibrotic
outcomes. Overall, there appears to be a vital cross-talk be-
tween the gut and lung mucosa and the microbial communities
within. The device through which this cross-talk may be
achieved remains unknown. Possible instruments include trans-
location of gut microbiota (including potential pathogens)
through blood or lymphatics, modulation of circulating or
lung-resident effector immune and inflammatory cells, or al-
terations in systemic cytokine profiles. These results highlight
the need for careful future human studies that will characterize
not only the lung, but also the gut microbiota during periods
of disease stability versus exacerbations. Additionally, murine
models may allow us to interrogate the PRRs and cytokine
signaling pathways that promote exacerbations.

FIGURE 1.
Proposed regulation of disease exacerbation by the gut/lung axis. During normal homeostasis, the lung microbiome is primarily characterized by low
biomass, but prominent diversity in microbial species. In contrast, the healthy gut microbiome is characterized by high diversity and high biomass. In homeostasis,
the gut microbiome helps shape development of lymphoid architecture and appropriate immune responsiveness. Loss of gut diversity (e.g., as a result of viral
infection or antibiotic use) may cause dysregulation of IL-17 or bacterial killing mechanisms systemically, potentially leading to impaired alveolar macrophage
function and the overgrowth of selective organisms with pathogenic potential that may result in disease exacerbation. Alternatively, some forms of chronic lung
disease exacerbations may be due to translocation and/or expansion of bacterial contents from the gut. Direct insults to the lung (e.g., viral infection or aspiration)
may exacerbate disease in part via their effects on the lung or gut microbiota. Alterations in systemic cytokines (e.g., Th2 or Th17 induction) may promote
pathologic fibrotic remodeling as well.
