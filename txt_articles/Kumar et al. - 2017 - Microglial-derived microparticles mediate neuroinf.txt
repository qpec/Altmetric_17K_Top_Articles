Abstract
Background: Local and systemic inflammatory responses are initiated early after traumatic brain injury (TBI), and
may play a key role in the secondary injury processes resulting in neuronal loss and neurological deficits. However,
the mechanisms responsible for the rapid expansion of neuroinflammation and its long-term progression have yet
to be elucidated. Here, we investigate the role of microparticles (MP), a member of the extracellular vesicle family,
in the exchange of pro-inflammatory molecules between brain immune cells, as well as their transfer to the
systemic circulation, as key pathways of inflammation propagation following brain trauma.
Methods: Adult male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to controlled cortical impact TBI for 24 h, and enriched MP
were isolated in the blood, while neuroinflammation was assessed in the TBI cortex. MP were characterized by flow
cytometry, and MP content was assayed using gene and protein markers for pro-inflammatory mediators. Enriched
MP co-cultured with BV2 or primary microglial cells were used for immune propagation assays. Enriched MP from
BV2 microglia or CD11b-positive microglia from the TBI brain were stereotactically injected into the cortex of
uninjured mice to evaluate MP-related seeding of neuroinflammation in vivo.
Results: As the neuroinflammatory response is developing in the brain after TBI, microglial-derived MP are released
into the circulation. Circulating enriched MP from the TBI animals can activate microglia in vitro. Lipopolysaccharide
stimulation increases MP release from microglia in vitro and enhances their content of pro-inflammatory mediators,
interleukin-1β and microRNA-155. Enriched MP from activated microglia in vitro or CD11b-isolated microglia/
macrophage from the TBI brain ex vivo are sufficient to initiate neuroinflammation following their injection into the
cortex of naïve (uninjured) animals.
Conclusions: These data provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying the development and
dissemination of neuroinflammation after TBI. MP loaded with pro-inflammatory molecules initially released by
microglia following trauma can activate additional microglia that may contribute to progressive neuroinflammatory
response in the injured brain, as well as stimulate systemic immune responses. Due to their ability to independently
initiate inflammatory responses, MP derived from activated microglia may provide a potential therapeutic target for
other neurological disorders in which neuroinflammation may be a contributing factor.

 Background
Microparticles (MP; also called microvesicles), a type of
extracellular vesicle, are small membrane-bound bodies
shed from the plasma membrane and released by cells
during activation or cell death [1]. They are composed
of the plasma membrane along with a limited amount of
cytoplasm and measure 100 to 1000 nm in diameter [2].
MP are enriched in the lipid microdomains, where chol-
esterol, phospholipids, and receptors are clustered [3],
and are distinguished from other extracellular vesicles
such as exosomes (30–100 nm; endosomal origin) and
apoptotic bodies (1000–2000 nm) [1]. MP can be re-
leased from virtually all cell types in the brain and con-
tain molecular signals in the form of non-secreted
proteins and DNA/RNA/microRNA (miR) molecules
that may be involved in cell-to-cell communication dur-
ing neurodevelopment and synaptic physiology [4]. MP
and other extracellular vesicles have also been impli-
cated in the development and progression of various
neurological diseases [4]. For example, in transmissible
spongiform encephalopathy accumulation and cell-to-
cell transmission of infectious prion proteins (PrPsc),
extracellular vesicles are a key mechanism of prion dis-
ease propagation [5, 6]. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
accumulating evidence indicates that a mechanism for
the progressive accumulation of misfolded mutant form
of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is cell-to-cell propa-
gation of SOD1 within the brain via extracellular vesicles
that extend the range and toxicity during disease [7, 8].
Similar mechanisms are thought to contribute to neuro-
toxic amyloid-β formation in Alzheimer’s disease models
[9–11]; however, these data are more controversial given
that other studies have shown that exosome-associated
amyloid-β are neuroprotective [12, 13].
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes cell death and
neurologic dysfunction through secondary injury mecha-
nisms characterized by edema, neuronal cell death, glial
activation, and infiltration of peripheral immune cells,
among others [14]. The inflammatory response to TBI is
highly complex and includes rapid proliferation and
migration of resident microglia to the site of injury in
response
to
damage-associated
molecular
patterns
(DAMPs) and other factors released by injured tissue
[15], as well as by infiltration of neutrophils and inflam-
matory monocyte subsets that contribute to the injury
milieu [16]. If the immune response is unable to resolve
effectively, or becomes dysregulated after TBI, it can
contribute to chronic neurodegeneration, due to chronic
activation of neurotoxic microglia [17]. Elevated levels of
MP have been reported in the cerebrospinal fluid of TBI
patients [18], and circulating MP derived from endothe-
lial cells, platelets, and leukocytes have been measured
acutely after severe isolated TBI [19]. These include
cerebral endothelium-derived MP release following focal
contusion injury [20] as well as neuronal- and astroglial-
derived MP release following mixed contusion and dif-
fuse axonal injury [21].
Given the increasingly recognized role for neuroin-
flammation in tissue damage after TBI, we examined
whether posttraumatic circulating MP released after in-
jury could be derived from microglia, as well as potential
mechanisms of microglial MP involvement in cell-to-cell
communication in the brain following trauma. We hy-
pothesized that MP released by microglia contain pro-
inflammatory molecules that contribute to the spread of
brain inflammation. We used flow cytometry to identify
the origin of brain-specific immune-related MP in the cir-
culation following controlled cortical impact in mice. To
investigate immunogenic properties of microglial-derived
MP, we used BV2 microglia and primary microglial cell
culture models. Finally, to demonstrate cell-to-cell propa-
gation of neuroinflammatory mechanisms within the
brain, we injected enriched MP derived from microglia
isolated from TBI cortex or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-
stimulated microglia into the cortex of uninjured mice.
Methods
Animals
Studies were performed using C57BL/6 adult male mice
(10–12 weeks old, 22–26 g). The mice were housed in
the Animal Care facility at the University of Maryland
School of Medicine under a 12-h light-dark cycle with ad
libitum access to food and water. All surgical procedures
were carried out in accordance with protocols approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.
Controlled cortical impact
Our custom-designed controlled cortical impact (CCI)
TBI
device
consists
of
a
microprocessor-controlled
pneumatic impactor with a 3.5-mm diameter tip. Mice
were anesthetized with isoflurane evaporated in a gas
mixture containing 70% N2O and 30% O2 and adminis-
tered through a nose mask (induction at 4% and main-
tenance at 2%). Depth of anesthesia was assessed by
monitoring respiration rate and pedal withdrawal re-
flexes. Mice were placed on a heated pad, and core body
temperature was maintained at 37 °C. The head was
mounted in a stereotaxic frame, and the surgical site was
clipped and cleaned with Nolvasan and ethanol scrubs.
A 10-mm midline incision was made over the skull, the
skin and fascia were reflected, and a 5-mm craniotomy
was made on the central aspect of the left parietal bone.
The impounder tip of the injury device was then ex-
tended to its full stroke distance (44 mm), positioned to
the surface of the exposed dura, and reset to impact the
cortical surface. Moderate-level TBI was induced using
an impactor velocity of 6 m/s and deformation depth of

 2 mm as previously described [22]. After injury, the inci-
sion was closed with interrupted 6-0 silk sutures,
anesthesia was terminated, and the animal was placed
into a heated cage to maintain normal core temperature
for 45 min post-injury. Sham animals underwent the
same procedure as TBI mice except for the impact.
Study 1
Sham (n = 6) and TBI (n = 6) of C57BL/6J mice were
anesthetized (100 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital, I.P.) at
24 h post-injury, and blood was collected in heparinized
syringes by aortic puncture for blood MP analysis. Ipsi-
lateral cortical tissue was rapidly dissected and snap-
frozen on liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction
Study 2
Sham (n = 5) and TBI (n = 5) of C57BL/6J mice were
anesthetized (100 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital, I.P.) at
7 days post-injury and transcardially perfused with ice-
cold 0.9% saline (100 ml). Ipsilateral cortical and hippo-
campal tissues were rapidly dissected and processed for
CD11b-positive selection and MP isolation.
Enriched MP isolation and analysis
Mice were anesthetized (100 mg/kg sodium pentobar-
bital, I.P.), and blood was collected in heparinized
syringes by aortic puncture. Blood was immediately
combined with fixative (100 μl/ml Caltag Reagent A fix-
ation medium, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to diminish ex
vivo microparticle (MP) aggregation. All reagents and
solutions used for MP analysis were sterile and filtered
(0.1-μm filter). Heparinized blood was centrifuged for
5 min at 1500×g, and supernatant was centrifuged at
15,000×g for 30 min to pellet platelets and other cell
debris [23]. Blood supernatants were used to collect total
blood MP (~250 μl) that were purified by adding PBS
(4 ml) and centrifuged at 100,000×g for 60 min at 4 °C as
previously described [23–30]. In each experiment, flow
cytometry in combination with microbead standards ran-
ging in size from 300 to 3000 nm was used to characterize
MP size. MP were distinguished from larger (apoptotic
body; >1000 nm) and smaller (exosomes; <100 nm) vesicles
based on size (SSC), and their phenotype was confirmed
using the unique MP surface marker, annexin V (details
below; see Fig. 1a). In parallel experiments, equal numbers
of circulating MP from sham and TBI mice (8 × 105 MP)
were resuspended in 100 μl serum-free DMEM media and
co-cultured with BV2 microglia (2 × 104 cells/well) for 24 h
at 37 °C and at 5% CO2 prior to cell extraction for markers
of microglial activation. The enriched MP population
obtained using this protocol may also contain other types
of extracellular vesicles such as exosomes.

MP characteristics. At 24 h post-injury, total blood MP is increased in TBI mice compared with sham-injured mice. b Measurements of leukocyte-derived

 Total and cell-derived MP were identified by flow cy-
tometry using an eight-color, triple-laser MACSQuant
Analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). MACSQuant
was calibrated every other day with calibration beads
(Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA), and forward and side
scatters were set at logarithmic gain. Photomultiplier
tube voltage and triggers were optimized to detect
submicron-sized particles. Microbeads of different diam-
eters (0.3 μm (Sigma; LB3), 1.09 μm (Spherotech, Lake
Forest, IL; BCP-10-5), and 3.0 μm (Spherotech, Lake
Forest, IL; BP-30-5)) were used to set initial parameters
and to confirm MP characteristics in each experiment.
To reduce small particle contaminants, all reagents and
solutions used for MP analysis were sterile and filtered
(0.1-μm filter; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) before use.
The expression of phosphatidylserine (PS) on MP was
detected using an anti-annexin V (FITC or APC) (1:50,
BD Biosciences PharMingen, catalog no: 556419) in
annexin buffer (5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 136 mM
NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1% BSA; pH 7.4). MP were incu-
bated with antibodies for 30 min at room temperature
(RT) in the dark. Annexin buffer (150 μl) was added to
each
sample
prior
to
MACSQuant
analysis.
True-
negative controls were established by a fluorescence-
minus-one analysis and using isotype-matched irrelevant
antibodies at the same concentration and under the
same conditions. Annexin V-positive particles with diam-
eters from 300 to 1000 nm were defined as MP. Blood MP
were further characterized by double labeling with specific
cell-specific antibodies: leukocytes (anti-CD18 (PE); 1:50,
Biolegend; catalog no: 101408) and monocyte/macro-
phages (anti-F4/80 (APC); 1:50, Thermo Fisher, catalog
no: MF48005). Microglial staining was performed using
anti-P2Y12 (1:1000, AnaSpec Inc., Fremont, CA) and anti-
CD45-PerCP (1:10, Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) as
follows: MP were incubated with anti-P2Y12 in annexin
buffer for 1 h at RT, washed and incubated with Alexa
Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:500;
Life Technologies) for 30 min, washed and further incu-
bated with pre-conjugated anti-CD45 for 30 min at RT,
and washed in annexin buffer prior to analysis by flow cy-
tometry. FlowJo software (Vx; Tree Star, Inc., Ashland,
OR) was used for analysis, and data are presented as per-
cent of annexin V-positive MP in the MP gate as set by
microbeads, unless otherwise specified.
In vitro MP analysis
BV2
microglia
(murine
microglial
cell
line)
were
cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supple-
mented with 10% fetal equine serum (HyClone, Logan,
UT), and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) at
37 °C with 5% CO2. DMEM media was filtered using
0.1-μm filters. BV2 microglia were seeded at a density of
0.6 × 106
in
60-mm
dishes
and
stimulated
with
lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 20 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) or
control media for 24 h. MP released into conditioned
BV2
microglial
media
were
characterized
using
a
MACSQuant
flow
cytometer
(Miltenyi
Biotec,
San
Diego, CA) analysis as described before. In parallel ex-
periments, MP in conditioned media were pelleted by cen-
trifugation as described before and MP-enriched pellets
were either resuspended in RIPA buffer (Teknova, Hollis-
ter, CA) for Western blotting or extracted using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen) for RNA analysis. In another experi-
ment, BV2 microglia cells were stained with 1 μM calcein
AM (Invitrogen) in DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C and then
stimulated with LPS (20 ng/ml) for 24 h. Calcein AM-
labeled MP were isolated from conditioned media by cen-
trifugation at 100,000×g for 60 min at 4 °C [23–30] and
were stained with anti-annexin V (APC) (1:50, BD Biosci-
ences
PharMingen,
catalog
no:
550474)
for
MP
characterization by flow cytometry as described before.
Levels of endotoxin (LPS) in pelleted MP from control
and LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia were determined using
a LAL Chromogenic Endotoxin assay (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, MA, USA) as per manufacturer’s instructions.
A standard curve was used to determine the concentra-
tion of endotoxin in each sample. Endotoxin levels are
expressed as endotoxin unit per milliliter (EU/ml).
MP co-culture studies
BV2 microglia were seeded at a density of 0.6 × 106 in
60-mm dishes and stimulated with LPS (20 ng/ml) or
control media for 24 h. MP released into conditioned
BV2 microglial media were isolated by centrifugation as
described before. Control and LPS-stimulated MP (total
8 × 105 MP) were co-cultured with BV2 microglia (2 ×
104/96 well) or primary microglia (1 × 105/96 well) that
were obtained from postnatal day 1 C57BL/6 mouse
pups as previously described [31] for 24 h at 37 °C and
at 5% CO2 prior to cell extraction using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen) to assess markers of microglial activation.
MP isolation from CD11b-positive cells from the sham
and TBI cortex
Magnetic bead-conjugated anti-CD11b and MACS sep-
aration technology (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) was
used to isolate microglia/macrophages from sham and
TBI brain tissue of C57BL/6J mice at 7 days post-injury
(n = 5/group; study 2 above). Briefly, ipsilateral cortical
and hippocampal tissues were rapidly microdissected,
and a single cell suspension was prepared using enzym-
atic digestion (Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit; Miltenyi
Biotec) in combination with a gentle MACS dissociator.
Myelin was removed using Myelin Removal Beads II and
LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec), and the cells were incu-
bated with anti-CD11b microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) and
loaded onto MS columns (Miltenyi Biotec) placed in the
Kumar et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation  (2017) 14:47

 magnetic field of a MACS separator. The negative frac-
tion (flow through) was collected, and the column was
washed three times with MACS buffer (Miltenyi Bio-
tech). CD11b-positive cells were eluted by removing the
magnetic field, resulting in the isolation of approxi-
mately 93% viable CD11b-positive cells from sham and
TBI mice [32]. Expression level of CD11b-positive se-
lected cells (MFI) was quantified by flow cytometry
using anti-CD11b (APC) (1:50; Miltenyi Biotech, catalog
no: 130-091-241). CD11b-positive cells were subse-
quently seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well in a 96-well plate in
DMEM-F12 containing 10% fetal calf serum and incu-
bated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 24 h. Ex vivo-secreted
MP from sham and TBI CD11b-positive cells were col-
lected from condition media by ultra centrifugation as
described before.
Intracortical injection of enriched MP
Study 1
Enriched MP were isolated from conditioned media of
control and LPS (20 ng/ml)-stimulated BV2 microglia as
described before. To neutralize the effects of MP, add-
itional groups of control and LPS-stimulated MP were
incubated with polyethylene glycol telomere B (PEG-TB;
6 μl per 100 μl media) for 1 h at RT as previously de-
scribed [25]. MP were resuspended in 100 μl artificial
CSF (Na 150, K 3.0, Ca 1.4, Mg 0.8, P 1.0, Cl 155 (mM);
Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, catalog no: 59-
7316), and 1 μl (total 8 × 103 MP) was injected intracor-
tically into C57BL/6 mice (n = 6) at stereotactic coordi-
nates of 2.0 mm anteroposterior, 1.0 mm mediolateral to
the bregma, and 1.0 mm below the pia using a 33-gauge
sharp needle attached to a 10-μl Hamilton syringe
(Hamilton Medical, Reno, NV, USA) and an injection
rate of 1 μl/10 min. The needle remained in situ for
5 min to prevent backflow before being withdrawn
slowly over 10 min. Twenty-four hours later, the mice
were euthanized and cortical tissue was collected using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) to assess markers of cortical
neuroinflammation.
Study 2
MP were isolated from conditioned media of control
and LPS (20 ng/ml)-stimulated BV2 microglia as de-
scribed before, and 1 μl MP (total 8 × 103 MP) were
injected intracortically into C57BL/6 mice (n = 4) as de-
scribed in study 1 above. Seven days later, mice were eu-
thanized and the brains were removed to assess markers
of microglial activation using histology.
Study 3
MP isolated from culture media of CD11b-positive cells
from sham and TBI brain as described above were resus-
pended in 100 μl artificial CSF (Harvard Apparatus), and
1 μl MP (total 8 × 103 MP) were injected intracortically
into C57BL/6 mice (n = 4) as described above. Twenty-
four hours later, the mice were euthanized and cortical
tissue was collected using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) to
assess markers of cortical neuroinflammation.
Real-time PCR
Total RNA including miR was extracted from snap-
frozen tissue, cells, or enriched MP, using a miRNeasy
mini isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Complemen-
tary DNA (cDNA) synthesis was performed on 1 μg of
total RNA using a Verso cDNA RT kit (Thermo Scien-
tific, Pittsburg, PA), as per manufacturer’s instructions.
For messenger RNA (mRNA) analysis, real-time PCR
was performed using TaqMan gene expression assays
on an ABI 7900 HT FAST Real-Time PCR machine
(Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was calculated
relative to the endogenous control sample (GAPDH)
to determine relative expression values (2−ΔΔCt, where
Ct is the threshold cycle). For miR analysis, a total of
10 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using
TaqMan miRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied
Biosystems) with miR-specific primer of miR-155 and
control U6. Reverse transcription reaction products
(1.5 μl) were used for qPCR as described above. Fol-
lowing real-time PCR, miR expression was calculated
relative to the endogenous control sample (U6) to de-
termine relative expression values (2−ΔΔCt, where Ct
is the threshold cycle).
Western blotting
Proteins were extracted using RIPA buffer (Teknova, Hol-
lister, CA), equalized, and loaded equally onto 5–20% gra-
dient gels for SDS PAGE (Bio-Rad; Hercules, CA).
Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes
and blocked overnight in 5% milk in 1x PBS containing
0.01% Tween-20 (PBS-T). The membrane was incubated
in rabbit anti-interleukin-1β (anti-IL-1β) (1:1000; Cell
Signaling, catalog no: sc-7884) and mouse anti-β-actin
(1:20,000; Sigma, catalog no: A1978) overnight at 4 °C,
then washed three times in PBS-T for 5 min, and incu-
bated in appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary anti-
bodies (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, West
Grove, PA) for 1 h at RT. Membranes were washed three
times in PBS-T, and proteins were visualized using Super
Signal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL). Chemiluminescence was cap-
tured using ChemiDoc TM XRS+ System (Bio-Rad;
Hercules, CA), and protein bands were quantified by
densitometric analysis using Image J (NIH, Bethesda,
MD). The data reflects the intensity of the target protein
band normalized based on the intensity of the endogenous
control for each sample (expressed in arbitrary units).

 Protein from cells was normalized to β-actin, and protein
from MP was normalized to Ponceau-S.
Immunofluorescence imaging
Twenty-micrometer coronal brain sections from −1.70 mm
from the bregma were selected, and standard immunostain-
ing techniques were employed. Briefly, 20-μm sections were
washed three times with 1x PBS, blocked for 1 h in goat
serum containing 0.4% Triton X-100, and incubated over-
night at 4 °C with primary antibody (rabbit anti-P2Y12
(1:1000, AnaSpec Inc., Fremont, CA; catalog no: AS-
55043A),
rabbit
anti-Iba-1
(1:200;
Wako
Chemicals,
Richmond, VA; catalog no: 019-197)). Sections were washed
three times with 1x PBS and incubated with appropriate
Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Tech-
nologies) for 2 h at RT. Sections were washed three times
with 1x PBS, counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-pheny-
lindole (DAPI; 1 μg/ml, Sigma), and mounted with glass
cover slips using Hydromount solution (National Diagnos-
tics, Atlanta, GA). Images were acquired using a fluorescent
Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope, at ×10 (Plan Apo 10× NA
0.45) or ×20 (Plan APO 20× NA 0.75) magnification.
Exposure times were kept constant for all sections in each
experiment. All images were quantified using Nikon ND-
Elements Software (AR 4.20.01). 6000–10,000 positive areas
were quantified per mouse per experiment, and expression
levels were expressed as binary area per region of interest
(ROI) × 106.
Assessment of microglial morphology
Neurolucida software (MBF Biosciences, Williston, VT)
was used to quantify cell body area and ramification
length of P2Y12-positive microglia in the cortex, hippo-
campus, and thalamus of enriched MP intracortical
injected mice as previously described [33]. Immunostained
microglia were outlined using the live image setting so
that the width of the ramified branches could be traced
while focusing on the section. Cell bodies were outlined
using the contour tool followed by tracing of the individ-
ual ramification using the dendrite line tool. Microglial
ramification length is expressed in micrometers,, and cell
body area is expressed in square millimeters.
Statistical analysis
Randomization and blinding protocols were employed,
and individuals performing in vitro and in vivo ana-
lysis were blinded to isolated MP groups. Quantitative
data were expressed as mean ± standard errors of the
mean (S.E.M.). qPCR and flow cytometry data were
analyzed by one-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc
adjustments
using
a
Student-Newman-Keuls
test.
Remaining data were analyzed using Student’s t test.
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad
Prism Program, Version 3.02 for Windows (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA, USA). A p < 0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant.
Results
Microglia-derived microparticles are released into
circulation following TBI
C57BL/6 male mice were subjected to TBI (moderate-
level CCI) or sham surgery, and 24 h later, animals were
euthanized and blood was collected for MP isolation and
characterization. Ipsilateral cortical tissue was also col-
lected to assess markers of brain inflammation. MP in
blood were measured by flow cytometry for annexin V,
which binds the externalized phosphatidylserine (PS)
present on the surface of MP. To exclude the presence
of annexin V-positive apoptotic bodies (>1000 nm) and
smaller exosomes (<100 nm) in the sample, microbead
standards (300, 1000, and 3000 nm) were used to gate
on MP (MP gate set between 300 and 1000 nm) (Fig. 1a).
There was a significant increase in annexin V-positive
MP in the blood of TBI mice when compared to sham-
injured controls (p < 0.05; Fig. 1a).
We next evaluated the origin of the circulating MP
based on unique markers derived from parental cells.
P2Y12/CD45-positive MP (microglial derived) were sig-
nificantly increased in the circulation when compared to
sham-injured control levels (p < 0.05; Fig. 1b). The
CD18-positive MP (leukocyte derived) increase after TBI
did not reach statistical significance, and TBI did not in-
crease levels of F4/80-positive MP (monocyte derived) in
the circulation at 24 h post-injury. These data indicate
that microglial-derived MP are released into the circula-
tion after moderate-level TBI.
Assessment of injured cortical tissue revealed a robust
neuroinflammatory response to TBI, with increased
mRNA expression of markers of microglial activation
and the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines. Specifically, TBI resulted in a significant
increase in mRNA for CD11b (p < 0.01), nitric oxide syn-
thase 2 (NOS2, p < 0.01), interleukin-1β (IL-1β, p < 0.05),
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α, p < 0.001), C-C motif
chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2, p < 0.01), interleukin-6 (IL-6, p
< 0.001), pro-inflammatory microRNA-155 (miR-155, p <
0.05), and the purinergic receptor P2X7 (p < 0.05) when
compared to the sham-injured group (Fig. 2a). Histological
assessment of P2Y12 expression on microglia in the ip-
silateral cortex revealed that the following moderate TBI
P2Y12-positive microglia transform from a ramified
morphological state to an activated state that with-

bundles
around highly enlarged cell bodies (Fig. 2b). Further,
Neurolucida reconstruction analysis of P2Y12-positive
cells demonstrated that ramification length was sig-
nificantly decreased (p < 0.01) and cell body area was

 significantly increased (p < 0.01) in microglia in the TBI
cortex as compared to sham-injured cortex (Fig. 2c).
TBI-induced circulating microparticles activate microglia
in vitro
To examine if circulating MP released after TBI could
promote inflammation, we co-cultured BV2 microglia in
the presence or absence of enriched MP from the blood
of sham-injured and TBI mice (Fig. 3). Equal number of
circulating enriched MP from sham and TBI blood (total
8 × 105) were incubated with naive BV2 microglia for
24 h, and subsequent activation was assessed by mRNA
expression of selected microglial activation markers.
When compared to BV2 microglia treated with sham
circulating enriched MP, there was a significant increase
in IL-1β (p < 0.01) and CCL2 (p < 0.05) in recipient
microglia co-cultured with TBI circulating enriched MP
(Fig. 3) and a trend towards increased in IL-6 and
NOS2 expression in this group. There was also a sig-
nificant increase in P2X7 (p < 0.05) in recipient micro-
glia treated with TBI circulating enriched MP when
compared to naïve microglia. There was no difference
in expression of other pro-inflammatory molecules
such as TNF-α and miR-155.

 LPS stimulation increases microparticle release in BV2
microglia, and pro-inflammatory molecules are enriched
in microparticles
We performed a MP release assay in BV2 microglia fol-
lowing LPS stimulation (20 ng/ml) for 24 h. MP release
was quantified by flow cytometry using Calcein AM-
stained BV2 microglia that were co-stained with the MP
marker annexin V. When compared to MP levels in
control BV2 microglia, LPS stimulation significantly in-
creased the number of annexin V/calcein AM-positive
MP (p < 0.001 vs control; Fig. 4a). We next measured IL-
1β and miR-155 in BV2 microglial cells and isolated
enriched MP from the conditioned media to determine
the relative expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in
MP vs cellular compartments. Following LPS stimula-
tion, IL-1β protein was not detected in the cells, but it
was significantly increased in LPS-stimulated enriched
MP (p < 0.001 vs LPS-stimulated cells; Fig. 4b). In
addition, following LPS stimulation, miR-155 was signifi-
cantly increased in BV2 microglial cells (p < 0.05 vs con-
trol cells; Fig. 4c). Notably, miR-155 was even more
highly enriched in LPS-stimulated MP (p < 0.01 vs LPS-
stimulated cells), indicating that enriched MP contain el-
evated concentrations of pro-inflammatory molecules
IL-1β and miR-155 following activation.
LPS-stimulated microparticles activate microglia in vitro
To test the hypothesis that enriched MP from activated
microglia can seed neuroinflammation, we isolated MP
from control and LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia and co-
cultured them with naïve BV2 or primary microglia for
24 h prior to assessing cellular markers of activation by
qPCR. When compared to control enriched-MP-treated
recipient BV2 microglia, there was a significant increase
in IL-1β (p < 0.001), TNF-α (p < 0.001), CCL2 (p < 0.001),
IL-6 (p < 0.01), and NOS2 (p < 0.001) mRNA in recipient
BV2 microglia treated with LPS enriched MP (Fig. 5a).
There was also a significant increase in miR-155 expres-
sion in BV2 microglia (p < 0.001) treated with LPS
enriched MP when compared to cells treated with con-
trol MP (Fig. 5a).
To demonstrate the specific activity of microglial-
derived enriched MP in activating microglia in these ex-
periments, we neutralized MP by co-incubating them
with polyethylene glycol telomere B (PEG-TB), a surfac-
tant that depletes MP without activating blood immune
cells [25]. To establish the dose of PEG-TB required to
neutralize microglial-derived MP, we performed a dose
response study in control and LPS-stimulated enriched
MP derived from BV2 microglia and incubated them
with increasing concentrations of PEG-TB for 1 h prior
to MP characterization by flow cytometry. We deter-
mined that 6 μl PEG-TB/100 μl significantly depleted
MP levels under both conditions (Fig. 5b), and this con-
centration was employed to neutralize microglial-derived
MP activity in in vitro studies. Next, we determined that
when LPS enriched MP were neutralized by PEG-TB
and co-cultured with naïve BV2 microglia for 24 h,
markers of microglial activation were significantly re-
duced. Specifically, recipient BV2 microglia incubated
with LPS MP + PEG-TB had significantly reduced ex-
pression of IL-1β (p < 0.001) and TNF-α (p < 0.001)
when compared to the LPS MP group (Fig. 5c). We con-
firmed the effects of LPS-stimulated enriched MP on
primary cortical microglia. There was a significant in-
crease in IL-1β (p < 0.01), TNF-α (p < 0.01), and IL-6 (p
< 0.05) mRNA in recipient primary microglia treated
with LPS enriched MP when compared to control MP-
treated cells (Fig. 6). There was also a significant in-
crease in miR-155 expression in primary microglia
(p < 0.01) treated with LPS enriched MP when compared
to cells treated with control MP (Fig. 6).

mice and were co-cultured with naïve BV2 microglia cells for 24 h. Microglial receptors (P2X7) and pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1β and CCL2)
were significantly increased in BV2 microglia treated with circulating TBI MP (*p < 0.05 and ***p < 0.001 vs naïve; ^p < 0.05 and ^^p < 0.01 vs sham
MP; one-way ANOVA with Student-Newman-Keuls correction for multiple comparisons; n = 6/group). There were no significant differences in
TNF-α, NOS2, IL-6, and miR-155 expression between treatment groups. Bars represent mean ± S.E.M.

 Finally, we confirmed that the effects of LPS enriched
MP on microglial activation were not due to LPS cross-
over. We measured LPS levels in the LPS enriched MP
samples using a limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay
and determined that the LPS concentration was negli-
gible (0.081 ± 0.009 EU/ml (<0.1 ng)) and well below
LPS concentrations previously shown to transfer LPS ac-
tivity in enriched MP [34].
Microglial-derived microparticles can seed brain
inflammation in vivo
To determine whether microglial-derived enriched MP
could seed neuroinflammation in the uninjured brain,
we
isolated
enriched
MP
from
control
and
LPS-
stimulated BV2 microglia and stereotactically injected
them into the cortex of adult male C57BL/6 mice. As a
control to demonstrate the specific activity of microglial-
derived enriched MP in promoting brain inflammation,
we neutralized enriched MP by co-incubating them with
PEG-TB as described before. After 24 h, cortical tissue
was collected and markers of brain inflammation were
assessed. When LPS enriched MP were injected into the
uninjured cortex, they produced a robust neuroinflam-
matory response resulting in a significant increase in IL-
1β (p < 0.01), NOS2 (p < 0.01), TNF-α (p < 0.001), IL-6
(p < 0.05), and miR-155 (p < 0.01) when compared to the
Fig. 4 Pro-inflammatory mediators are enriched in MP following lipopolysaccharide stimulation of BV2 microglia. a Calcein AM-stained BV2 microglia were
stimulated with LPS (20 ng/ml) for 24 h, and MP were isolated by differential centrifugation and stained with anti-annexin V, prior to characterization by
flow cytometry. When compared to MP levels in control BV2 microglia, LPS stimulation significantly increased the number of annexin V/calcein AM-positive
MP (***p < 0.001 vs control; Student’s t test; n = 4/group). b IL-1β protein expression in enriched MP vs cell lysates of control and LPS-stimulated BV2

microglia were co-cultured with control or LPS-stimulated MP ± PEG-TB (6 μl/100 μl) for 24 h. LPS MP treatment increased IL-1β and TNF-α in BV2 microglia

 control MP-injected group (Fig. 7). Notably, when LPS
enriched MP were neutralized by PEG-TB and injected
into the uninjured cortex, the cortical neuroinflamma-
tory
response
was
attenuated,
such
that
the
LPS
enriched MP + PEG-TB group had significantly re-
duced expression of IL-1β (p < 0.001), NOS2 (p <
0.001), TNF-α (p < 0.001), IL-6 (p < 0.05), and miR-155
(p < 0.01) when compared to the LPS enriched MP
group (Fig. 7). Intracortical injection with control MP,
control MP + PEG-TB, or PEG-TB alone did not pro-
mote a neuroinflammatory response in the cortex.
In a separate study, control and LPS enriched MP
were stereotactically injected into the cortex of unin-
jured C57BL/6 mice. At 7 days post-surgery, mice were
euthanized and brain tissue was saline perfused and
fixed for immunohistochemical analysis of microglial ac-
tivation in the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus using
Iba-1 and P2Y12 immunostaining. There was a signifi-
cant increase in Iba-1 staining in the ipsilateral cortex,
hippocampus, and thalamus of C57BL/6 injected with
LPS enriched MP (p < 0.001) when compared to mice
injected with control MP or sham mice (Fig. 8a–c). Fur-
ther morphological analysis of P2Y12-positive microglia
using Neurolucida reconstruction software revealed that
C57BL/6 mice injected with LPS enriched MP resulted
in increased microglial activation. Specifically, microglial
ramifications were significantly reduced in length in the
cortex and hippocampus of the LPS enriched-MP-
injected cortex (p < 0.01 for both vs control MP), and
the microglial cell body area was significantly increased
in the cortex (p < 0.001), hippocampus (p < 0.01), and
thalamus (p < 0.01 vs control MP; Fig. 9a–c). These data
indicate that enriched MP derived from LPS-stimulated
microglia produce a robust neuroinflammatory response
when injected into the cortex of uninjured mice.
Microparticles produced by microglia/macrophage
isolated from the TBI brain induce neuroinflammation in
non-injured mice
To relate MP-mediated seeding of neuroinflammation to
secondary injury mechanisms in the TBI brain, we sub-
jected adult male C57BL/6 mice to sham or moderate-
level TBI and isolated microglia/macrophages from the ip-
silateral cortex at 7 days post-injury using MACS CD11b
magnetic beads. We then cultured CD11b-positive cells
for 24 h and collected microglia/macrophage-derived
enriched MP from sham and TBI samples. Equal num-
bers of enriched MP (total 8 × 103 MP) were stereo-
tactically injected into the cortex of uninjured adult
male C57BL/6 mice, and cortical tissue was collected
24 h later to assess markers of neuroinflammation.
Injection of sham MP significantly increased IL-1β
(p < 0.001) and TNF-α (p < 0.001) expression, but not
miR-155 expression, when compared to the naïve control
group (Fig. 10). Furthermore, injection of TBI enriched MP
significantly increased IL-1β (p < 0.001), TNF-α (p < 0.05),
and miR-155 (p < 0.01) expression in the cortex when
compared to the sham MP-injected group. Although there
was a modest increase in IL-6 and NOS2 expression in
sham MP and TBI enriched MP-injected groups when
compared to the naïve control group, these changes did not
reach statistical significance. These data indicate that
enriched MP derived from the microglia/macrophages

Discussion
TBI initiates complex local and systemic immune re-
sponses. However, the precise nature of posttraumatic neu-
roinflammation, its regulatory mechanisms, and role in
secondary injury remain to be elucidated [35]. Recent
studies have offered intriguing evidence regarding the po-
tential role played by extracellular vesicles in cell-cell com-
munication between immune cells and their targets [36, 37].
In the present study, we examined the release of microparti-
cles (MP), a special class of extracellular vesicles, from the
injured brain and their contribution to mechanisms of
microglial activation and related neuroinflammation.
Although high levels of MP have been detected in the
blood of TBI patients [18, 19], their cellular origins are not
well defined. Clinical studies indicate that MP in the blood
are primarily derived from platelets, with much smaller
fractions released from erythrocytes, granulocytes, mono-
cytes, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells [18, 19, 21, 38, 39].
Recent studies have highlighted the potential systemic
pathological effects of MP following brain injury, including
brain-trauma-associated coagulopathy [21]. MP released
from neurons (NSE-positive MP) and astrocytes (GFAP-
positive MP) accumulated in the circulation within 3 h of
experimental TBI and were associated with microvascular
fibrin deposition in the heart, kidney, and lung [21]. We ob-
served a significant increase in total circulating MP at 24 h
post-injury. Furthermore, an evaluation of the origin of cir-
culating MP based on the presence of unique markers de-
rived from parental cells revealed that microglial MP
displayed the greatest increase (approximately twofold)
following TBI, accounting for nearly 15% of total circulat-
ing MP. Although P2Y12 is also expressed on platelets
[40], the detected P2Y12-positive MP were co-stained
with CD45, a unique myeloid cell marker that is not
expressed on platelets [41, 42], indicating that the P2Y12-
positive MP enriched in the circulation following TBI
were not derived from platelets. These data indicate that
microglial-derived MP are released by the TBI brain and
reach the systemic circulation. Importantly, we observed
robust
neuroinflammatory
responses
in
the
injured
brain—with activation of P2Y12-positive microglia in the
cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus—associated with up-
regulated expression of classical pro-inflammatory media-
tors (IL-1β, TNF-α, CCL2, IL-6, NOS2, and miR-155) in
the injured cortex.

 Previous studies indicated that microglia and other
myeloid cells in vitro can shed MP, which store and re-
lease pro-inflammatory molecules such as IL-1β [43],
inflammasome components, and MHCII protein [44].
These data suggest that MP produced by reactive myeloid
cells, such as microglia, may propagate inflammation and
the rapid dissemination and presentation of antigens. A
major finding of our study was that circulating enriched
MP from TBI mice significantly activated recipient micro-
glia in vitro and up-regulated pro-inflammatory signaling
molecules such as IL-1β and CCL2.
Similarly, MP from LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia sig-
nificantly increased IL-1β, TNF-α, CCL2, IL-6, NOS2,
and miR-155 expression in recipient BV2 or primary
microglia, confirming the ability of MP to act as independ-
ent microglial activators. LPS stimulation of microglia is an
established in vitro model for TBI neuroinflammation
because LPS up-regulates key pro-inflammatory medi-
ators in microglia (IL-1β, TNF-α, NOS2, CCL2) that
are robustly up-regulated in microglia/macrophages in
the injured cortex and hippocampus following TBI
[31, 45, 46]. In the current study, we demonstrated
that LPS-stimulated microglia release MP into condi-
tioned media that can induce pro-inflammatory responses
in non-activated recipient microglial cells. Import-
antly, MP depleted of their content by addition of

 MP-neutralizing surfactant, PEG-TB, lost their ability
to activate recipient cells, thus demonstrating the critical
function of MP in promoting the pro-inflammatory
response in the target cells.
We demonstrated that IL-1β and miR-155 were highly
enriched in MP that can propagate a pro-inflammatory
response in recipient cells. IL-1β does not contain an N-
terminal signal sequence for secretion and therefore
must be released from the cell through alternative mech-
anisms [47]. LPS stimulation increased IL-1β protein in
enriched MP but not in microglia cells, where only IL-
1β mRNA was elevated. Astrocyte-derived ATP has been
shown to induce extracellular vesicle shedding and IL-
1β release in microglia through a P2X7 receptor-
dependent mechanism [43]. Notably, ATP is released
following acute brain injury and promotes a powerful
chemotactic response in microglia towards the site of in-
jury [15]. In our study, the P2X7 receptor was signifi-
cantly increased at sites of inflammation in the injured
cortex; thus, P2X7 receptor-dependent mechanisms of
MP release in microglia may be involved in the propaga-
tion of inflammation following TBI. Other mechanisms
of MP release in microglia—such as MP fusion with the
cell membrane, macropinocytosis [48], and direct release
of their contents into the cytosol [37], as well as indirect
mechanisms through binding of pattern-recognition re-
ceptors in the endosomal compartment (primarily Toll-
like receptor 7/8—TLR7/8) [49]—may also contribute to
the propagating neuroinflammation and warrant further
investigation.
MP can also transfer miRs [50–53]. The levels of miR-
155,
a
well-characterized
pro-inflammatory
miR
in
microglia [54], were highly enriched in microglial-
derived MP. miR-155 has been shown to be a key regu-
lator of the inflammatory response in experimental
models of stroke, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis [55–58]. We
also
demonstrated
that
miR-155
was
significantly
increased in the cortex of TBI mice, and its expres-
sion was significantly increased when LPS-stimulated
MP from BV2 microglia or MP from CD11b-positive
microglia/macrophages
from
the
TBI
brain
were
injected into the cortex of uninjured mice. Secreted
miR-155 from adipocyte-derived MP in obese mice
induces a pro-inflammatory activation state in mac-
rophages that causes chronic inflammation and local
insulin resistance [59]. Thus, secreted miR-155 from
MP may be an important driver of neuroinflammation
following TBI.
The pathogenic role of MP in the inflammatory response
was demonstrated in vivo by showing that injection of
microglial-derived MP induces neuroinflammation at the
site of injection and at more distant sites. Cortical injection
of enriched MP isolated from LPS-stimulated BV2 micro-
glia significantly increased markers of microglial activation
(Iba-1 and P2Y12 morphological transformation) in the ip-
silateral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus and up-
regulated pro-inflammatory markers in the cortex. These
data
support
prior
research
that
demonstrated
that
myeloid-derived microvesicles that are detected in the CSF
of multiple-sclerosis patients and closely associate with dis-
ease course can propagate inflammation in vivo when
injected locally [60]. Furthermore, cortical injections of
enriched MP collected from ex vivo cultures of microglia/
macrophages purified from TBI brain markedly induce ex-
pression of pro-inflammatory molecules miR-155, IL-1β,
and TNF-α in the cortex of non-injured animals. To our
knowledge, these latter observations describe the first use
of purified brain microglia to demonstrate the transfer of
the posttraumatic neuroinflammatory phenotype using MP
as a vehicle.
It is important to recognize that the enriched MP
population obtained using our experimental protocol
may also contain other types of extracellular vesicles
such as exosomes. In this study, we used established
flow cytometry protocols to characterize MP properties
[25], but this technique is limited to the identification of
particles greater than 300 nm, preventing the detection
of smaller microvesicles and all exosomes [61]. Electron
microscopy can directly show that extracellular vesicles
exist in a sample, but fixation processes involved in the
technique can alter vesicle shape and size [62]. Other
Fig. 10 MP isolated from CD11b-isolated microglia/macrophages
following TBI increase neuroinflammation in the cortex of uninjured
mice. CD11b-microglia/macrophages in the cortex of sham and TBI
were isolated at 7 days post-injury and cultured for 24 h prior to
collecting MP. Enriched MP were stereotactically injected into the
cortex of adult male C57BL/6 mice and markers of cortical
neuroinflammation were measured at 24 h postinjection. There
was a significant increase in pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1β and
TNF-α) in the cortex of the control MP-injected group (***p < 0.001 vs
naïve group). When compared to the control MP-injected group, there
was a further significant increase in pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1β,
TNF-α, and miR-155) in the cortex of the TBI MP-injected group
(^p < 0.05, ^^p < 0.01, ^^^p < 0.001 vs control MP-injected group;
one-way ANOVA with Student-Newman-Keuls correction for multiple
comparisons; n = 5/group). Bars represent mean ± S.E.M.

 techniques
such
as
dynamic
light
scattering
and
nanoparticle-tracking analyses have several limitations
and introduce biases when characterizing extracellular
vesicle properties [61, 63, 64]. The
focus
of
the
current study was the pathophysiological responses of
microglial-derived MP rather than the nature of the
enriched microvesicles. We determined that enriched
MP derived from microglia could propagate neuroin-
flammation in vivo. We selectively depleted enriched
MP by incubating them with PEG-TB, a drug that
emulsifies MP without modifying circulating leukocyte
activation [2, 25]. When we co-cultured depleted MP
from LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia with recipient
naïve BV2 microglia, or injected depleted MP into the
cortex of uninjured mice, pro-inflammatory responses
were significantly attenuated. These results support
our hypothesis that it is the enriched MP component
of purified extracellular vesicles derived from micro-
glia that propagates neuroinflammation.
Conclusions
The major findings of these studies are that (1) microglial-
derived MP are released after TBI, (2) circulating enriched
MP from the TBI animals can activate microglia in vitro,
(3) LPS activation increases MP release from microglia and
elevates their content of pro-inflammatory mediators IL-1β
and miR-155, and (4) enriched MP from activated microglia
in vitro or CD11b-isolated microglia from the TBI brain ex
vivo are sufficient to initiate neuroinflammation following
intracortical injection in naïve animals. Given their ability
to independently initiate pro-inflammatory responses, MP
derived from activated microglia may provide a novel thera-
peutic target for TBI and other neurodegenerative disorders
associated with neuroinflammation.
