IMPORTANCE Changes in behavior and personality are 1 criterion for the diagnosis of
dementia. It is unclear, however, whether such changes begin before the clinical onset of
the disease.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether increases in neuroticism, declines in conscientiousness,
and changes in other personality traits occur before the onset of mild cognitive impairment
or dementia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cohort of 2046 community-dwelling older adults who
volunteered to participate in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging were included. The
study examined personality and clinical assessments obtained between 1980 and July 13,
2016, from participants with no cognitive impairment at first assessment who were followed
up for as long as 36 years (mean [SD], 12.05 [9.54] years). The self-report personality scales
were not considered during consensus diagnostic conferences.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Change in self-rated personality traits assessed in the
preclinical phase of Alzheimer disease and other dementias with the Revised NEO Personality
Inventory, a 240-item questionnaire that assesses 30 facets, 6 for each of the 5 major
dimensions: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.
RESULTS Of the 2046 participants, 931 [45.5%] were women; mean (SD) age at first
assessment was 62.56 (14.63) years. During 24 569 person-years, mild cognitive impairment
was diagnosed in 104 (5.1%) individuals, and all-cause dementia was diagnosed in 255 (12.5%)
participants, including 194 (9.5%) with Alzheimer disease. Multilevel modeling that
accounted for age, sex, race, and educational level found significant differences on the
intercept of several traits: individuals who developed dementia scored higher on neuroticism
(β = 2.83; 95% CI, 1.44 to 4.22; P < .001) and lower on conscientiousness (β = −3.34; 95% CI,
−4.93 to −1.75; P < .001) and extraversion (β = −1.74; 95% CI, −3.23 to −0.25; P = .02). Change
in personality (ie, slope), however, was not significantly different between the nonimpaired
and the Alzheimer disease groups (eg, neuroticism: β = 0.00; 95% CI, −0.08 to 0.08; P = .91;
conscientiousness: β = −0.06; 95% CI, −0.16 to 0.04; P = .24). Slopes for individuals who
developed mild cognitive impairment (eg, neuroticism: β = 0.00; 95% CI, −0.12 to 0.12;
P = .98; conscientiousness: β = −0.09; 95% CI, −0.23 to 0.05; P = .18) and all-cause dementia
(eg, neuroticism: β = 0.02; 95% CI, −0.06 to 0.10; P = .49; conscientiousness: β = −0.08;
95% CI, −0.16 to 0.00; P = .07) were also similar to those for nonimpaired participants.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE No evidence for preclinical change in personality before the
onset of mild cognitive impairment or dementia was identified. These findings provide
evidence against the reverse causality hypothesis and strengthen evidence for personality
traits as a risk factor for dementia.

hanges in personality and behavior are one clinical cri-
terion for the diagnosis of dementia.1 Little is known,
however, as to whether personality changes before the
onset of clinical dementia. The neuropathologic processes that
underlie Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementias start
years before onset of clinical dementia.2-4 It is, therefore, pos-
sible that changes in personality (eg, loss of motivation or in-
creased irritability) might be an early sign of AD that precedes
the onset of cognitive and functional impairment.

since 1980. Using data up to 3 decades before onset of the dis-
ease, we tested the hypothesis that individuals later diag-
nosed with AD would show greater changes in personality be-
fore symptom onset compared with unaffected individuals
(Figure 1). In particular, we expected increases in neuroti-
cism and declines in conscientiousness9 as early signs of the
underlying neurodegeneration before the onset of clinical
symptoms of dementia. We focused on AD because it is the
most common cause of dementia but also examined change
before the onset of MCI and all-cause dementia. In addition
to the 5 major traits, we examined changes in 30 facets of per-
sonality to provide a detailed account of personality change.

of a psychological feature that is altered by AD. It also pro-
vides a test of whether reverse causality may explain the as-
sociation between personality traits and risk of AD and de-
mentia found in prospective studies.15-20 That is, if there is
evidence that personality traits change before the onset of de-
mentia, it could indicate that the personality traits associated
with AD are a consequence of the neuropathologic process
rather than independent risk factors for AD.
Methods
Participants
The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) began to
study physical and cognitive changes associated with aging in
1958.21 The BLSA is carried out by the Intramural Research Pro-
gram of the National Institute on Aging. Healthy individuals
of different ages are continuously enrolled in the study and as-
sessed with regular follow-up visits. Current follow-up care oc-
curs annually for individuals aged 80 years or older, bienni-
ally for those aged 60 to 79 years, and every 4 years for younger
participants.Eligibilitycriteriahavebeenreported.22TheBLSA
participants receive an in-depth physical and cognitive evalu-
ation and complete a detailed personality assessment. Partici-
pants provide written informed consent approved by the Na-
tional Institutes of Health Institutional Review Board. The
analyses in this article were also approved by the Florida State
University Institutional Review Board. Participants do not re-
ceive financial compensation.
Weexcluded536individualsfromaninitialsampleof2582
individuals with personality data (Figure 2). Participants were
excluded mainly because they were younger than 50 years at
the last personality assessment or because they completed the
personality questionnaire only after the onset of cognitive im-
pairment (ie, MCI or dementia). Because we were interested
in changes in the preclinical phase of the disease, we also ex-
cluded all personality assessments that occurred in the year
of the disease onset or after. We replaced missing education
information with the sample mean for 6 nonimpaired indi-
viduals. As of July 13, 2016, 784 (38.3%) participants had died,
and 289 (14.1%) were not active for a variety of reasons, in-
cluding loss to follow-up. To evaluate the link between per-

Key Points
Question Do changes in personality traits occur before the onset
of mild cognitive impairment or clinical dementia?
Findings In a cohort study that followed up 2046 older adults for
as long as 36 years, no evidence of significant change in self-rated
personality was found before the onset of mild cognitive
impairment or clinical dementia.
Meaning No personality changes that could be characterized as
an early sign of dementia were found.

 sonality and attrition, we compared the baseline personality
scores of the active and nonactive participants, adjusting for
age, sex, race, and educational level in a multivariate analysis
ofcovariance.Themultivariatetestwassignificant(F1238 = 3.33;
P = .005), and the nonactive participants scored approxi-
mately 0.2 SD lower on extraversion compared with the ac-
tive cohort (P = .006); there were no significant differences in
the other traits (all P > .05).
Personality Assessment
Participants completed the self-report version of the Revised
NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R)14 or an earlier version
in 1980 and 1986 (eMethods in the Supplement). The NEO-
PI-R is a 240-item questionnaire that assesses 30 facets, 6 for
each of the 5 major dimensions: neuroticism, extraversion,
openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Raw scores
were standardized to T scores (mean [SD], 50 [10]) using com-
bined sex norms reported in the manual.14 In the BLSA sample,
the NEO-PI-R factor structure shows high congruence with the
normative structure (Tucker φ = 0.97-0.99), the Cronbach α
internal consistencies for the 5 dimensions ranged from 0.87
to 0.92, and the test-retest correlations for the 5 dimensions
ranged from 0.78 to 0.85 over a mean interval of 10 years.23
Clinical and Neuropsychological Evaluations
The BLSA participants were evaluated at enrollment for his-
tory of neurologic or cerebrovascular disease and for impair-
ment of cognitive or behavioral functioning. Follow-up evalu-
ations included a neuropsychological battery and clinical
examination, including an informant and participant struc-
tured interview. The latter was based on the Clinical Demen-
tia Rating (CDR)24 scale after 1998 and the Dementia
Questionnaire25before1998.TheCDRwasadministeredateach
visit to participants enrolled in the autopsy and positron emis-
sion tomography amyloid imaging studies; the remaining par-
ticipants received the CDR if they scored 4 or more on the
Blessed Information Memory Concentration test.26 All par-
ticipants were reviewed at a diagnostic consensus confer-
ence if they screened positive (score ≥4) on the Blessed Infor-
mationMemoryConcentration,iftheirinformantorparticipant
CDR score was 0.5 or higher, or if the results of their Demen-
tia Questionnaire were abnormal. In addition, all participants
were evaluated by case conference on death or withdrawal. All
neuropsychological diagnostic tests and clinical data were
available for review at the diagnostic conference. The NEO per-
sonality scores were not available or considered during con-
sensus conferences. Mild cognitive impairment was based on
thecriteriaofPetersenetal.27Diagnosisofdementiawasbased
on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Third
Edition Revised)28 criteria, which did not include personality
change as a criterion, and diagnosis of AD was based on the
National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disor-
ders and Stroke–Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders As-
sociation criteria.29
Statistical Analysis
The primary aim was to examine the course of personality
change before the onset of symptoms of MCI or dementia.
We used multilevel modeling (ie, hierarchical linear model-
ing [HLM]30), also known as mixed models or growth curve
analysis, to estimate the trajectory of each trait. In HLM, the
number and spacing of measurement observations may
vary across individuals given that the time-series observa-
tions for each person are used to estimate the individual’
s
trajectory (level 1), and those individual parameters are the
basis of group estimates (level 2). Using HLM, we examined
the association between cognitive status and the intercept
and slope of each personality trait, with primary interest in
the slope (ie, the rate of change). For individuals who devel-
oped MCI or dementia, time was coded as time to onset of
MCI, with the year of onset coded as 0. For individuals
who remained nonimpaired, time was set as 0 for the date
of the most recent personality assessment. With this coding,
the intercept parameters refer to the most recent assess-
ment and not the usual baseline. The nonimpaired cohort
was the reference group in all analyses. The primary analy-
ses examined the effect of AD on the intercept and slope of
each trait; MCI and dementia other than AD were excluded
from this analysis. Then we examined a broader model that
included all-cause dementia and MCI. To examine whether
changes from the NEO-PI (1980-1986) to NEO-PI-R (1989-
2016) had an effect on the results, we excluded the 1980-
1986 assessments in sensitivity analyses. We included par-
ticipants with only 1 personality assessment in the HLM
models because such information can contribute to more
robust HLM estimates. In sensitivity analyses, we examined
whether the results were similar when excluding cases with
only 1 assessment. All models included age, age squared
sex, race, and educational level as covariates for the inter-
cept and slope because these demographic variables have
been associated with both personality and risk of dementia.
Age in decade and educational level were grand-mean
centered.30

 Because we expected the changes in personality to accel-
erate in the last few years before the onset of cognitive im-
pairment (Figure 1), we repeated the analyses by estimating
models with curvilinear slopes (ie, time squared). We also plot-
ted personality trajectories based on the last 2 assessments.
Using these last 2 assessments, we evaluated rank-order sta-
bility to test whether it declines in the preclinical phase.
Results
Descriptive statistics for the overall sample and by cognitive
statusarepresentedinTable1.Thesampleincluded931(45.5%)
women,andrace/ethnicitywas1582(77.3%)white,374(18.3%)
black, 55 (2.7%) Asian or Pacific Islander, and 35 (1.7%) other
participants. The 2046 participants completed 8665 person-
ality assessments between 1980 and July 13, 2016 (range, 1-18;
mean [SD], 4.24 [3.06]). The time elapsed from the first per-
sonality assessment ranged from 1 to 36 years (12.05 [9.54]).
During the study (24 569 person-years), 104 (5.1%) partici-
pants developed MCI and 255 (12.5%) participants developed
all-cause dementia, including 194 (9.5%) who developed AD.
Comparisonoftheunadjustedbaselinemeansindicatethatthe
group that later developed AD or all-cause dementia scored
higher on neuroticism and lower on extraversion, openness,
and conscientiousness compared with the nonimpaired
participants.
Domain-Level Multilevel Modeling Analysis
Table 2 reports estimates from the HLM analysis. The basic
parameters for the slope indicated that, in the reference group,
there were small declines in neuroticism, extraversion, and
openness and small increases in agreeableness and conscien-
tiousness. These patterns are consistent with previous
reports.31 We tested our primary hypothesis by comparing the
personality trajectory of the nonimpaired group with the tra-
jectories of the AD group. Contrary to our hypothesis, there
were no significant differences in the rates of change be-
tween the nonimpaired and AD groups for neuroticism
(β = 0.00; 95% CI, −0.08 to 0.08; P = .91), conscientiousness
(β = −0.06; 95% CI, −0.16 to 0.04; P = .24), and the other per-
sonality traits. Although the trajectories were similar, there
were significant mean-level differences on the intercept. The
AD cohort scored higher on neuroticism (β = 2.83; 95% CI, 1.44
to 4.22; P < .001) and lower on conscientiousness (β = −3.34;
95% CI, −4.93 to −1.75; P < .001) and extraversion (β = −1.74;
95% CI, −3.23 to −0.25; P = .02) than the nonimpaired group.
Further data are reported in Table 2.
In a model that included quadratic in addition to linear
slopes, we found no evidence of accelerated change in per-
sonalityintheADgroupcomparedwiththenonimpairedgroup
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). We also found similar results in
sensitivity analyses that excluded assessments in 1980 and
1986basedontheNEO-PI(eTable2intheSupplement)orwhen
participants with only 1 personality assessment were ex-
cluded (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
We repeated the analysis by comparing the nonimpaired
with all-cause dementia and MCI groups (eTable 4 in the
Supplement). The dementia group scored higher on the inter-
cept of neuroticism (β = 2.87; 95% CI, 1.64 to 4.10; P < .001)
and lower on conscientiousness (β = −4.02; 95% CI, −5.43 to
−2.61; P < .001), extraversion (β = −2.38; 95% CI, −3.71 to −1.05;
P = .001), and openness (β = −1.65; 95% CI, −2.98 to −0.32;
P = .02). The MCI group scored lower on the intercept of open-
ness (β = −2.95; 95% CI, −4.97 to −0.93; P = .005). Similar to
the AD analysis, the rate of change in conscientiousness
(β = −0.08; 95% CI, −0.16 to 0.00; P = .07) and neuroticism
(β = 0.02; 95% CI, −0.06 to 0.10; P = .49) were not signifi-
cantly different between the all-cause dementia and the non-
impaired groups. Individuals who developed all-cause de-
mentia had a steeper decline in openness compared with those
who were not impaired (β = −0.07, 95% CI, −0.13 to −0.01;
P = .03). The slopes of the MCI were not significantly differ-
ent from the slopes of the nonimpaired group (eg, neuroti-

We applied the same analytic model to the 30 facets. As for the
5factors,thereweresignificantdifferencesoninterceptoffacet
between the AD and nonimpaired groups (eTables 6-10 in the
Supplement). In particular, compared with the nonimpaired
group, the AD group scored significantly higher on most neu-
roticism facets (anxiety, angry hostility, depression, and
vulnerability to stress) and scored lower on most conscien-
tiousness facets (competence, order, dutifulness, and self-
discipline). Of primary interest, the rate of change for the fac-
ets of neuroticism and conscientiousness did not differ
significantly between the AD and the non-impaired groups.
Personality Change Approaching Disease Onset
Itispossiblethatchangeintheslopewouldoccurmainlywithin
the years nearest to the onset of the disease. To test this pos-
sibility, we selected the last 2 assessments for each partici-
pant with available data. For the AD group, the last 2 assess-
ments were means (SDs) of 6.44 (4.32) and 3.47 (3.09) years
before the onset of dementia (eTable 11 in the Supplement).
Consistent with the HLM results and the broader literature, the
AD group scored higher on neuroticism and lower on consci-
entiousness. Contrary to expectations, the AD group did not
increase in neuroticism or decline in conscientiousness
(Figure 3).
Rank-Order Stability
Thereismarkedvariabilityincognitiveperformanceinthepre-
clinical phase of AD,32 and personality stability is signifi-
cantly lower in individuals with cognitive impairment or

personality in the preclinical phase. Using the last 2 assess-
ments before the onset of the disease, we found no evidence
of lower rank-order stability in the AD group (eTable 11 in the
Supplement).
Discussion
Our analyses of longitudinal data that spanned up to 36 years
found no evidence of personality change in the preclinical

was 77.58 (7.95) years. The AD group scored higher on neuroticism and lower
on conscientiousness before the onset of the disease. Contrary to expectations,
the AD group did not increase in neuroticism or decline in conscientiousness in
the preclinical phase of the disease.

 phase of dementia. The trajectory of personality traits and fac-
ets for individuals who were later diagnosed with MCI or de-
mentia did not differ significantly from that of nonimpaired
olderadults.Wefurtherfoundthatpersonalityremainedstable
even within the last few years before the onset of the disease,
and the high rank-order correlations supported the reliability
of the data. However, we found differences of approximately
0.3 SD between the AD and nonimpaired groups on the inter-
cept of neuroticism and conscientiousness, which were not an
emerging prodromal sign of the disease and were consistent
with results from other prospective studies.15-19 These find-
ings provide evidence against the reverse causality hypoth-
esis as an explanation for the association between personal-
ity and risk of incident dementia.15-19 From a clinical
perspective,thesefindingssuggestthattrackingchangeinself-
rated personality as an early indicator of dementia is unlikely
to be fruitful, while a single assessment provides reliable in-
formation on the personality traits that increase resilience (eg,
conscientiousness) or vulnerability (eg, neuroticism) to clini-
cal dementia.
This research has relevance to the question of reverse cau-
sality for the association between personality and risk of in-
cident AD.15-19 That is, if personality changed in response to
increasingneuropathologyinthebraininthepreclinicalphase,
the association between personality and AD could have been
due to the disease process rather than personality as an inde-
pendent risk factor. We did not, however, find any evidence
that neuroticism and conscientiousness changed signifi-
cantlyastheonsetofthediseaseapproached.Thus,ratherthan
an effect of AD neuropathology, these traits appear to confer
risk for the development of the disease.
Ourfindingsarealsorelevantfordelineatingthenaturalhis-
tory of personality change in relation to incident dementia and
shouldbeinterpretedinthecontextofpreviousstudiesthathave
trackedthecourseofclinicalandpsychologicaltraitsbeforethe
onset of dementia. Weight loss and cognitive decline, for ex-
ample, precede the onset of clinical dementia,34-37 but evi-
dence for changes in depressive symptoms in the prodromal
phase of dementia is more mixed.37-39 For personality traits, 2
previousstudiesreportedthatpersonalitychangeprecededthe
clinicaldiagnosis.Thesestudies,however,werebasedonitems
from the Blessed Dementia Scale or the Cambridge Examina-
tion for Mental Disorders of the Elderly.10,11 These instruments
are not standardized measures of major personality traits, and
both instruments include questions about changes in person-
ality that ask informants to make retrospective evaluations. It
is unclear whether such retrospective evaluations are
accurate.40,41Inalargestudyofhealthyadults,forexample,per-
ception of personality change was mostly unrelated to actual
change measured with prospective assessments.41
Another important difference across personality studies
is the use of self-report vs informant ratings. Self-rated per-
sonality provides participants’perspectives of themselves—
the most common method of personality assessment. Infor-
mant reports are another important source of information,42
especially when the individual to be evaluated is cognitively
impaired.5-9 Individuals with AD could be anosognosic to
change in their psychological traits and functioning. Self-
reported personality might remain stable and reflect premor-
bid functioning more than current traits. Contrary to this idea,
however, there is evidence that self-report personality traits
change with the onset of cognitive impairment and demen-
tia: a large study has found that rank-order stability declines
to rtt = 0.43 with the onset of dementia.33 The present study
extends knowledge by indicating that such changes do not be-
gin in the preclinical phase of AD (rtt>0.80).
Strengths and Limitations
Among the strengths of the study are the prospective design,
the long-term follow-up, the relatively large sample size, and
the in-depth personality and clinical assessments. Among the
limitations of the study is the use of a selective sample with a
higher educational level. The findings from the BLSA, how-
ever, are generally consistent with those from other samples,43
as in the case of the association between personality and risk
of dementia.15-20 Another limitation is the relatively younger
age of nonimpaired participants, some of whom may develop
dementia. In addition, more research is needed on personal-
ity and AD biomarkers18,19,44,45 and how personality may in-
crease resilience against neuropathology and forestall the
emergence of clinical dementia.
Conclusions
This study found that change in personality does not initiate
before the onset of MCI or AD. The findings are contrary to the
reverse causality hypothesis and provide further support that
personality traits are a risk factor for the development of
dementia.
