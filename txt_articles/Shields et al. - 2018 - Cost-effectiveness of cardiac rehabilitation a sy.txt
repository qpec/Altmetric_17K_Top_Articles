systematic review

AbstrACt
Patients may be offered cardiac rehabilitation (CR), 
a supervised programme often including exercises, 
education and psychological care, following a cardiac 
event, with the aim of reducing morbidity and mortality. 
Cost-constrained healthcare systems require information 
about the best use of budget and resources to maximise 
patient benefit. We aimed to systematically review 
and critically appraise economic studies of CR and 
its components. In January 2016, validated electronic 
searches of the National Health Service Economic 
Evaluation Database (NHS EED), Health Technology 
Assessment, PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Embase databases 
were run to identify full economic evaluations published 
since 2001. Two levels of screening were used and 
explicit inclusion criteria were applied. Prespecified 
data extraction and critical appraisal were performed 
using the NHS EED handbook and Drummond checklist. 
The majority of studies concluded that CR was cost-
effective versus no CR (incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) ranged from $1065 to $71 755 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)). Evidence for specific 
interventions within CR was varied; psychological 
intervention ranged from dominant (cost saving and 
more effective) to $226 128 per QALY, telehealth ranged 
from dominant to $588 734 per QALY and while exercise 
was cost-effective across all relevant studies, results were 
subject to uncertainty. Key drivers of cost-effectiveness 
were risk of subsequent events and hospitalisation, 
hospitalisation and intervention costs, and utilities. 
This systematic review of studies evaluates the cost-
effectiveness of CR in the modern era, providing a fresh 
evidence base for policy-makers. Evidence suggests 
that CR is cost-effective, especially with exercise as a 
component. However, research is needed to determine 
the most cost-effective design of CR.
IntroduCtIon
Globally, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease 
is increasing due to ageing and population 
growth.1 Following a cardiac event, patients may 
be offered cardiac rehabilitation (CR), a super-
vised programme, typically including exercises, 
health education and psychological intervention.2 
Evidence suggests that CR programmes can reduce 
morbidity and mortality following a cardiac event, 
along with increasing quality of life and psycholog-
ical well-being.3 
In the UK, approximately 88 
000 people start CR 
annually.4 The average cost is reported at £477 per 
person (2010, UK pounds sterling), representing 
a potential total cost of around £42 
million annu-
ally.5 CR programmes have been shown to reduce 
unplanned hospital admissions, with the potential 
to save health systems resources and reduce the 
burden on already stretched cardiac departments.3
Where there is a growing demand placed on the 
healthcare 
system 
but 
with 
limited 
budgets, 
economic 
evaluation supports decision-making. Different 
types of economic evaluations can be conducted. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) measures the cost 
and the clinical impact (health benefit) of an inter-
vention and translates into a single value: the incre-
mental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Cost–utility 
analysis falls within the CEA type of economic eval-
uation but uses utilities and life expectancy to show 
differences in health benefit. Cost–benefit analysis 
expresses outcomes in monetary units. Finally, 
cost-minimisation analysis is only appropriate if 
there is clear evidence that interventions are of 
equal health benefit.
T
wo earlier reviews of economic evaluations for 
interventions in CR6 7 found evidence to support 
the cost-effectiveness of CR intervention. However, 
evidence was limited by study quality, variation 
across CR design and delivery, and uncertainty. 
More recently, a review focused on economic eval-
uations of CR interventions in low/middle-income 
countries.8 This identified that CR intervention was 
cost-effective in heart failure patients, although, 
intervention cost was a key issue. Our study adds 
a fresh perspective by focusing on full economic 
evaluations (synthesising costs and health benefits) 
to allow for a truer assessment of cost-effective-
ness and updates the literature as developments in 
cardiac treatment mean that older literature is no 
longer relevant.2 9
The current review aimed to answer the following 
question: is CR cost-effective in the modern era 
(post stent and with statins), compared to alterna-
tives or no intervention? Our secondary research 
question was to determine the effects of modes of 
delivery and core components of CR on the cost-ef-
fectiveness of CR in the modern era. We also criti-
cally appraise the evidence to identify data gaps and 
inform future research needs.
Methods
A systematic literature search and review was 
conducted to identify economic evaluations of 
CR interventions. The protocol was registered 
on the PROSPERO register of systematic reviews 
(CRD42016050725)

review
Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and Health 
Technology Assessment databases.
Searches were structured to identify cost-effectiveness 
evidence, published in English since 2001. Due to developments 
in therapies, surgery and medications offered in CR in recent 
years, older studies are no longer relevant, hence restriction 
is justified.9 10 Common search terms included CR terms and 
economic evaluation terms. Search terms for economic evalu-
ations were taken from the Centre for Reviews and Dissemina-
tion.11 Intervention terms were taken from previously published 
search strategies.12 13 Medical subject headings were combined 
with free-text terms to form search strategies. Terms varied 
according to database designs. Search terms are provided in the 
online supplementary material.
selection
Following database searching, titles and abstracts of identi-
fied citations were manually screened to assess their relevance 
to the review. Explicit inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) 
studies focusing on adults offered CR in line with National Insti-
tute for Health and Care Excellence eligibility guidelines14–16; 
(2) CR programmes or specific interventions within CR were 
eligible as interventions; (3) alternative interventions and usual 
care were accepted comparators; (4) studies had to be primary 
studies including a full economic evaluation, comparing inter-
ventions in terms of cost-effectiveness, cost–utility, cost–benefit 
or cost minimisation analysis.
Following the first round of screening, full text articles were 
obtained and were reassessed against the eligibility criteria. T
wo 
reviewers (GES and DB) carried out each screening stage inde-
pendently; differences in opinion were discussed and decided 
with a third reviewer (LMD).
data extraction and synthesis
Data extraction included study objectives, methods and 
results. Studies were critically appraised using data extracted 
consistent with the NHS EED handbook and Drummond 
checklist.17 18
Data extraction was performed by two reviewers (GES 
and DB), with results cross-checked and discussed and final-
ised with the assistance of a third reviewer (LMD). Due 
to the heterogeneity among studies, a narrative synthesis, 
rather than a quantitative synthesis, was used to summarise 
findings.
Cost data were converted to 2016 US$, using the consumer 
price index and purchasing power parity conversion factor, to 
allow for easier comparison between studies.19 20
results
There were 564 initial search results; following screening of 
titles/abstracts, 57 articles were assessed. Nineteen studies were 
included in the review (figure 1).
An overview of study characteristics is given in table 1.

review
Critical appraisal
As expected, table 1 shows wide variation in study populations 
because CR is recommended for multiple patient groups.14 Vari-
ation between studies and the lack of a pool of studies with 
the same well-defined population characteristics means that 
we cannot clearly differentiate between population groups; 
instead we consider the group as a whole. This review focuses 
on a cardiac population in the modern era (post stent and with 
statins); the use of stents or statins was not reported in nine of 
the studies.21–29 Reported use of statins varied from 46% to 98%, 
and the proportion of the population admitted to CR following 
a stent ranged greatly (8%–82%).30–33
Interventions
Seven studies compared CR with no CR programme21–23 30 34–36; 
remaining studies compared intervention types within CR (see 
table 1). Publication dates suggest that more recent interest in 
CR has been around the role of telehealth and how frequent 
monitoring within CR, aided by information and communica-
tion technologies (ICTs), can make an impact.
The design of CR varied greatly within the studies. Three 
studies did not describe the content of CR.22 34 36 The most 
common intervention included was exercise/physical activity 
(14/19).21 23 25–28 30–33 35 37–39 Seven studies included education and 
information.26–28 30–33 Of these, three studies did not describe the 
intervention.27 28 33 The remainder reported limited information, 
one was aimed at symptom management and healthy eating, two 
focused on risk factor modification and one provided informa-
tion on rehabilitation topics.26 30–32 Psychological intervention 
was the least common component included (6/19), ranging from 
stress management tips to more-intensive psychosocial coun-
selling.23 27–30 40 T
wo studies focused on care settings.27 28 One 
study compared hospital-based (outpatient) CR with home-
based (manual step-by-step guide) CR, components of CR were 
the same.27 There were some key differences; outpatient reha-
bilitation was delivered by a multidisciplinary team, whereas 
home-based patients communicated only with a CR nurse and 
home-based CR initiated sooner after discharge.27 In the second 
study, the content of CR remained the same with inpatient and 
outpatient settings compared; both arms were subjected to iden-
tical CR for 6 
hours per day.28 Telehealth intervention design 
varied greatly. Three studies measured physical activity using 
devices: one with a pedometer-based intervention and telephone 
coaching,38 one with an accelerator and personalised training 
protocols32 and one with a comprehensive package of devices 
to measure activity and to monitor health which was shared 
with healthcare providers.26 A further study simply delivered a 
personalised, automated package of text messages and provided 
details to a website with further information.25
The most common comparator was no CR in which patients 
received general medical care (7/19) and usual care (6/19), 
both of which are variable across settings, limiting external 
validity.21 22 24 25 29 30 33–38 40
Methods
The five modelling studies used multiple evidence sources with 
likely mixed population characteristics.34–38 Only one study 
clearly described the identification of inputs.37 Four studies were 
Markov models which reflected the main outcomes identified 
in the clinical literature (active disease with varying symptoms, 
hospitalisation and death).34 35 37 38 One study did not clearly 
report methods.36 A single study presented a within-trial evalua-
tion with an added survival model to extrapolate evidence over 
longer time horizons.21
Thirteen studies were trial-based economic evaluations. While 
trials are generally a robust evidence source, populations may act 
differently out of a trial, limiting generalisability. Eleven were 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs).21 23–27 29–33 40 One study was 
non-randomised; randomisation was proposed to participants 
but they could reject it and be allocated to the group of their 
choice.28 Randomisation was rejected by the majority, leaving the 
study susceptible to self-selection bias. Blinding was not explic-
itly addressed in most studies.23 24 26–30 33 40 One study reported 
that it was not blinded.31 The remaining studies mentioned that 
only researchers and practitioners were blinded.21 25 32 While 
blinding is an important factor in limiting bias, it is accepted that 
blinding is challenging in non-pharmacological trials.41
One study used a large Medicare database for a retrospective 
cohort study.22 Although more susceptible to bias than RCT 
evidence, this approach has some advantages, for example, 
cohort size (n=4324).22
health benefit
The majority of cost–utility studies used quality-adjusted life-
years (QALYs) that incorporated data from generic survey 
based measures of health status: the EuroQol-5D  (EQ-5D) 
(7/16),24 25 27 28 32 34 37 36-Item Short Form Health Survey 
(2/16)26 31 and the Assessment of Quality of Life 4D ques-
tionnaire (1/16).38 The EQ-5D has been shown to be a valid/
reliable 
measure in the cardiovascular population and is recom-
mended in English guidelines.42 43 One study used a disease-spe-
cific questionnaire, that is, the Utility-based Quality of Life-Heart 
Questionnaire.30 T

estimate utility.33 35 The time trade-off is a direct utility measure-
ment, whereas survey measures are indirect. While both methods 
(direct and indirect) are robust, the literature has noted that 
values produced differ between the methods, limiting compara-
bility between studies.44 One study found that the use of direct 
measurement increased the net QALY and cost-effectiveness of 
the intervention compared with a generic measure, highlighting 
that caution is needed when interpreting results across studies 
due to the variation in methods.23
All the cost-effectiveness studies used life-years as the 
outcome.21 22 35 37 This ignores one of the key goals of CR 
(reducing morbidity), potentially underestimating the benefits of 
an effective intervention.
Costs
T
wo studies obtained costs from cost databases without specifying 
the types of costs included.22 34 Costs included in the remaining 
studies are shown in table 2. Three studies only included cardi-
ac-related costs, neglecting possible interactions between cardiac 
health and general health.32 35 38 Lost wages/productivity losses 
are less relevant in this population; a UK CR audit reported the 
mean age for accessing CR to be above retirement age.4 More 
relevant are informal care costs (1/19) as family/friends may 
undertake caring responsibilities. However, informal care data 
may be difficult to collect and highly variable.
uncertainty analysis
The majority of studies (17/19) included some sensitivity 
analysis.21–30 32–35 37 38 40 Fifteen studies included a proba-
bilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) using Monte Carlo simu-
lation to judge uncertainty22–29 32–35 37 38 40 In nine of the 
papers, authors explicitly compared PSA results with a 
threshold for cost-effectiveness.23–25 29 33 35 37 38 40 In a further 
six studies, PSA was conducted, but authors did not define a 
threshold.22 26–28 32 34 Nine studies included PSA and one-way 
sensitivity analysis,26–29 33–35 37 38 whereas  two studies only 
included one-way sensitivity analysis.21 30 The most common 
parameters varied in one-way sensitivity analysis were interven-
tion and hospitalisation costs, mortality rates and repeat events, 
and utilities. A single study considered subgroups, analysing 
results separately according to cardiac risk, referring diagnosis 
and gender.33
Completed Drummond checklists are given in the online 
supplementary material.
study results
Table 3 displays the key study results.
General CR
All studies had a positive net cost (higher costs in the interven-
tion arm) and were associated with an increase in health, hence 
it is up to decision-makers to decide whether the cost increase 
is worth the health gains. All studies comparing CR with no CR 
judged that the intervention was cost-effective at chosen thresh-
olds (thresholds differ across countries and papers reflected 
this).45 A threshold does not exist for life-year gained (LYG) 
which limits the interpretation. Interpreting the cost–benefit 
study results is challenging due to the reporting in the paper (eg, 
no specified monetary value attributed to a disability adjusted 
life-year) and the lack of clear consensus on how to interpret 
cost–benefit analysis.
T
wo studies that considered exercise-based CR versus no 
CR produced the lowest ICER values per QALY and LYGs.21 35 
Although this suggests that exercise-focused CR may be the most 
cost-effective option, differences in study design means that this 
conclusion is limited and uncertain.
One study focused on CR uptake rates and concluded that 
higher uptake rates would reduce disease burden; however, the 
use of RCT data to inform outcomes may not reflect real life.36
T
wo of the studies looking at CR versus no CR included PSA 
assessing the probability of cost-effectiveness given uncertainty 
in the data used. Estimates ranged between 58% and 83%.23 35
Exercise components of CR
T
wo studies compared exercise-based CR with an education only 
option.24 31 Depending on the costing perspective, both studies 
had an instance where intervention dominated education only 
(cost saving and health increasing). Both studies concluded exer-
cise-based CR was cost-effective. One of the studies included 
uncertainty analysis, estimating that exercise-based CR was 
cost-effective in 59%–74% of cases.24 A further study compared 
supervised exercise therapy with standard care and concluded 
that it would be cost-effective in around 55% of cases, demon-
strating uncertainty.37.
Telehealth-based or assisted CR
Four of the most recent studies looked at the use of telehealth 
interventions.25 26 32 38 One study comparing an individualised 
ICT delivered CR with hospital-based CR produced the highest 
ICER estimate identified across all of the studies ($588 
734 per 
QALY).26 However, authors noted that in real life, increasing 
patient numbers may increase economies of scale and reduce 
costs. The remaining studies compared telehealth rehabilitation 
packages that tracked health and exercise statistics.25 32 38 All 
studies concluded that telehealth interventions considered were 
cost-effective (from dominant to $24 
385 per QALY). Estimates 
of the probability of cost-effective were very different; in one 
study this ranged between 46% and 53% indicating substantial 
uncertainty, whereas in the other study it was between 72% and 
90%.25 38
Other studies
Distribution of CR over longer or shorter time frames was the 
focus of one study, which found that a 12-month programme 
was dominant and cost-effective in over 60% of cases versus 
3 
months.33 This was the only study to look at results in different 
subgroups, finding that the 12-month CR was cost-effective for 
patients with lower risks of disease progression and for female

patients, whereas 3-month CR was cost-effective for high-
risk patients and for male patients. T
wo studies compared CR 
settings; no significant differences were found between home-
based and hospital-based CR, but outpatient CR was found to be 
cost-effective than inpatient CR.27 28 The two studies on psycho-
logical therapy had very different findings, likely due to the 
wide variation in intervention type: with one study identifying 
a home-based cognitive–behavioural programme to be cost-ef-
fective in the majority of cases versus usual care (67%) and the 
other finding that learning and coping education strategies to be 
cost-effective in only 29% of the time.29 40
dIsCussIon
This review evaluates the cost-effectiveness of CR in the modern 
era providing a fresh evidence base for policy-makers. The 
majority of studies concluded that CR was cost-effective versus 
no CR, but there was more variation in the results of studies 
focusing on single components or delivery of CR. Exercise inter-
vention in CR appears cost-effective, though uncertainty was 
high. Evidence for psychological intervention was limited and 
varied. Telehealth was the focus of recently published papers 
and the evidence found is in alignment with the wider literature; 
although there is evidence of cost-effectiveness, larger, robust 
studies are needed to strengthen conclusions46 47 48. There is also 
the likelihood that telehealth results in a real-world setting may 
be very different; for example, economics of scale may reduce 
costs, patients may adhere to the technologies differently and for 
uncertain lengths of time.
Key drivers of cost-effectiveness were risk of subsequent events 
and hospitalisation, hospitalisation and intervention costs, and 
utilities. Only one study considered results by subgroups: iden-
tifying differences according to gender, referral reason and 
cardiac risk.33 Given the variation in patients referred to CR, 
this suggests not all patients should be treated in the same way. 
All studies had limitations including uncertainty, sample sizes 
and data sources. Combined with heterogeneity across methods, 
population and settings, the evidence is uncertain.
Our review took a different approach in terms of study inclu-
sion to previous reviews, focusing on full economic evaluations 
across all CR groups, intervention types and settings. Although 
previous reviews found evidence to support the cost-effective-
ness of CR intervention, this included the use of data from the 
1980s to 1990s which struggles to speak to the challenges of 
healthcare commissioning in the modern era of cardiology.6 7 
Similar to our review, authors noted that evidence was limited by 
study quality, variation in CR design/delivery 
and uncertainty.6 7
This review is subject to limitations. It was limited to 
English-language articles, introducing a risk of bias. Searches 
did not include the grey literature, therefore may be less likely 
to identify studies with uncertain or negative findings.49 The 
evidence base should be re-evaluated over time as new papers 
are published.
This review highlights specific areas for subsequent studies 
to investigate and address, particularly uncertainty due to study 
design and data, definitions for standard care and subgroup 
analyses. The review also indicates a paucity of evidence in low/
middle-income countries, despite 80% of cardiovascular-related 
deaths occurring in these countries.50 Finally, despite evidence 
linking symptoms of anxiety and depression to repeat events and 
mortality, psychological interventions were the least common 
component of CR considered and results were mixed. Future 
research is needed to determine whether and what forms of 
psychological therapy could be cost-effective in CR. This should 
be prioritised given recent calls for closer integration of psycho-
logical and physical health outcomes.51
