In Brief
Multicellular organisms eliminate
abnormal but viable cells based on their
fitness status through cell competition to
maintain tissue integrity. Here, Coelho
et al. report that fitness-based neuronal
selection occurs in the course of
neurodegeneration. Death of unfit
neurons is beneficial, protecting against
disease progression by restoring motor
and cognitive functions.

SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form
of dementia, impairing cognitive and motor func-
tions. One of the pathological hallmarks of AD is
neuronal loss, which is not reflected in mouse
models of AD. Therefore, the role of neuronal death
is still uncertain. Here, we used a Drosophila AD
model expressing a secreted form of human amy-
loid-b42 peptide and showed that it recapitulates
key aspects of AD pathology, including neuronal
death and impaired long-term memory. We found
that neuronal apoptosis is mediated by cell fitness-
driven neuronal culling, which selectively eliminates
impaired neurons from brain circuits. We demon-
strated that removal of less fit neurons delays b-am-
yloid-induced brain damage and protects against
cognitive and motor decline, suggesting that con-
trary to common knowledge, neuronal death may
have a beneficial effect in AD.
INTRODUCTION
Multicellular organisms have evolved mechanisms to maintain
tissue homeostasis and integrity throughout development and
aging. Besides cell-intrinsic surveillance mechanisms, relative
fitness levels within a cell population are constantly monitored,
ensuring the removal of suboptimal but otherwise viable cells
(Merino et al., 2016). The elimination of potentially dangerous
or abnormal cells based on their fitness status is known as cell
competition. Recent findings prove cell competition is a broad
biological process proposed to constitute a quality control
mechanism against developmental malformations (de la Cova
et al., 2004; Gibson and Perrimon, 2005; Moreno et al., 2002),
tumorigenesis (Alexander et al., 2004; Hogan et al., 2009; Kajita
and Fujita, 2015; Martins et al., 2014; Mene
´ ndez et al., 2010),
and aging (Merino et al., 2015). However, the cell competition
machinery may be subverted by precancerous cells to acquire
a super-fit status, enabling them to expand, kill, and invade sur-
rounding wild-type tissue with a lower fitness status (Eichenlaub
et al., 2016; Levayer et al., 2015; Moreno and Basler, 2004; Suij-
kerbuijk et al., 2016). Still, cell competition has not yet been
investigated in the course of aging-associated disorders, partic-
ularly in neurodegenerative diseases.
In Drosophila, the fitness status is translated at the cellular
level by fitness fingerprints, which are encoded by distinct iso-
forms of the Flower protein located at the extracellular mem-
brane (Petrova et al., 2012; Rhiner et al., 2010; Yao et al.,
2009). Flower is a conserved protein with three isoforms in
Drosophila that differ solely at the extracellular C terminus:
Flowerubi is expressed ubiquitously, while FlowerLoseB and
FlowerLoseA are upregulated in suboptimal cells. The display
of loser isoforms in a subset of cells is sufficient to target
them for elimination by apoptosis, which depends on the tran-
scription of the fitness checkpoint gene azot (Merino et al.,
2015). Azot is an EF-hand calcium binding protein dedicated
exclusively to cell competition-related apoptosis that integrates
upstream relative fitness levels and targets suboptimal cells for
death and subsequent engulfment by hemocytes (Portela et al.,
2010; Casas-Tinto
´ et al., 2015; Lolo et al., 2012). Mounting ev-
idence demonstrates cell competition is a conserved process
ranging from Drosophila to mammals that can also occur in
post-mitotic cells and differentiated adult tissue such as follic-
ular epithelia or the neural system (Kolahgar et al., 2015; Tamori
and Deng, 2013). The cell competition mediators flower and
azot, for example, have been found to mediate elimination of
injured or misconnected neurons (Merino et al., 2013; Moreno
et al., 2015). The flower code is cell type specific; in the nervous
system, only FlowerLoseB, not FlowerLoseA, is expressed in sub-
optimal neurons (Merino et al., 2013).
Neuronal loss is a key symptom of Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. AD is a slow,
progressive disease characterized by initial subtle memory
problems that deteriorate to severe cognitive impairment,
behavioral changes, and difficulty to walk. The main patholog-
ical hallmarks of AD are brain deposition of extracellular amyloid
plaques and intracellular fibrils of hyperphosphorylated tau,
exacerbated inflammation, and finally neuronal damage and

 death (Braak and Braak, 1991). According to the amyloid
cascade hypothesis, b-amyloid-related toxicity is considered
the primary cause of the disease, but the mechanisms medi-
ating amyloid-induced neurodegeneration and cognitive decline
have not been fully elucidated (Ashe and Zahs, 2010; Huang
and Mucke, 2012; Karran and De Strooper, 2016; Soldano
and Hassan, 2014).
Post-mortem brain sections and structural MRI in AD patients
show cerebral atrophy in regions involved in memory process-
ing, such as the cortex and the hippocampus (Ossenkoppele
et al., 2015; Seab et al., 1988). These findings suggest that the
subpopulations of neurons primarily affected by AD, including
the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampal CA1 projection neu-
rons, may be more vulnerable to cellular stress responses eli-
cited by misfolded amyloid (Go
´ mez-Isla et al., 1996; Saxena
and Caroni, 2011; Wakabayashi et al., 1994). Although central
to human pathology, mechanisms of neuronal loss have been
understudied in vivo, because AD mouse models do not recapit-
ulate this aspect, showing little neuronal death (Ashe and Zahs,
2010; Karran et al., 2011).
Here we sought to analyze a potential role of fitness-based
neuronal elimination in the context of AD onset and progression
in a Drosophila model in which human b-amyloid expression is
induced in the adult fly brain. We found a physiological mecha-
nism that identifies and purges less fit neurons, delaying cogni-
tive decline and motor disability.
RESULTS
Expression of Amyloid-b42 in the Drosophila Nervous
System Affects Neuronal Fitness
First, we tested whether neurons transit through a stage of
reduced fitness when overexpressing Ab42 (Figure 1A). We ex-
pressed a cassette containing two copies of the human amy-
loid-b42 (Ab42) peptide fused to a signal peptide for secretion,
under the control the GMR-Gal4 driver, known to produce a
strong degenerative phenotype in the Drosophila eye (Figure 1D)
(Casas-Tinto et al., 2011), henceforth abbreviated as GMR >
Ab42. To monitor cell fitness markers in the optic lobe, where
GMR-Gal4 is expressed, we devised a sensitive reporter to
detect FlowerLoseB by knocking in a flowerLoseB::mCherry-
tagged construct in the endogenous flower locus (Figure 1B).
FlowerLoseB::mCherry (indicator of low fitness) was strongly up-
regulated in the adult optic lobe of GMR > Ab42 flies, but not
in the GMR>lacZ control (Figures 1D and 1F).
To control whether the secretion of a peptide is sufficient to
downregulate fitness levels and induce flowerLoseB, we ex-
pressed the secreted form of a small peptide, endothelial mono-
cyte-activating polypeptide (EMAP) (17 kDa), under the control
of GMR-Gal4. Secreted EMAP is a chemotactic clue that attracts
hemocytes to sites of cell competition (Casas-Tinto
´ et al., 2015).
We confirmed that secretion of EMAP alone does not upregulate
FlowerLoseB::mCherry in the optic lobe, indicating that secretion
of an innocuous peptide is not sufficient to decrease the fitness
levels of neurons (Figures 1D and 1F).
The FlowerLoseB isoform was particularly upregulated in
neurons of the optic lobes, as detected with the neuronal
marker Elav (Figure S1A). Accordingly, FlowerLoseB expression
did not co-localize with cells expressing the glial marker Repo
(Figure S1B).
We then tested activation of another marker of low fitness,
azot, which is transcribed in cells destined to die based on
previous fitness comparison (Merino et al., 2015). To visualize
azot expression, we generated (1) azot::mCherry transgenic
flies, which carry an extra copy of azot fused to mCherry, in-
serted in another chromosome (Figure 1C), and (2) azot
{KO;GFP} flies, wherein GFP was placed in the endogenous
locus of the previously knocked out azot gene (Figure 1G).
With both lines, we found that azot not only was upregulated
in the optic lobes of GMR > Ab42 adult flies but was already
activated
in
neurons
at
previous
developmental
stages,
including the eye discs of the larva and retinas of mid-pupa
(Figures 1E, 1H, and 1I).
Expression of Misfolding-Prone Toxic Peptides Linked
to Huntington’s Disease, but Not to Parkinson Disease,
Triggers Neuronal Competition
Toinvestigateneuronalfitnesscomparisoninothertypesofneuro-
degenerative diseases, we turned to published human transgenes
reported to induce degenerative phenotypes in the fly: Hunting-
tinQ128 (HttQ128) and a-SynucleinA30P (a-SynA30P). HttQ128
is a pathogenic form of the human huntingtin gene that encodes
an expanded repeat of 128 poly-glutamines, causing reduction
of viability, retinal death, and abnormal motor behavior in
Drosophila (Lee et al., 2004). a-SynA30P is a mutant allele linked
to familial Parkinson disease that originates premature loss of
dopaminergic neurons, formation of brain inclusions similar to
Lewis bodies, and decrease of climbing ability when expressed
in flies (Feany and Bender, 2000; Song et al., 2017). HttQ0 and
a-SynWT, which carry a non-pathogenic form of huntingtin and
the wild-type allele of a-synuclein, respectively, served as
controls.
For this experiment, we employed a previously published
translational reporter, in which FlowerUBI, FlowerLoseA, and Flow-
erLoseB are tagged with a specific fluorescent protein: yellow
fluorescent protein (YFP), GFP, and red fluorescent protein
(RFP), respectively (Yao et al., 2009). We discovered that
expression of HttQ128 from the GMR driver induces augmented
levels of FlowerLoseB in the adult brain, contrary to the non-path-
ogenic form, HttQ0 (Figures 2A and 2B). Surprisingly, levels of
FlowerLoseB did not change with ectopic expression of the Par-
kinson-related peptides a-SynA30P and a-SynWT (Figures 2E
and 2F). The same results were obtained using the FlowerLoseB::
mCherry reporter to detect changes in cell fitness levels upon
expression of these toxic peptides in the eye imaginal disc of
the larva (Figures S2A–S2C).
Although both HttQ128 and a-SynA30P induce neurodegener-
ation by accumulation of protein aggregates in Drosophila
models, our results indicate that only HttQ128 triggers neuronal
competition. This result may be explained by the difference in
toxicity levels imposed on the tissue by each of these trans-
genes. We observed that HttQ128 expression leads to increased
cell death in a larval epithelium (eye disc), in opposition to the
a-SynA30P transgene, which did not lead to significantly
increased apoptosis under the same conditions (Figures 2C,
2D, 2G, and 2H).

Drosophila Nervous System Generates Sub-

(A) Schematic illustrating neuronal fitness com-
parison. Neurons express ubiquitously Flowerubi
or FlowerLoseA at their cellular membrane, but
external insults such as a traumatic injury or failing
to establish synaptic connections during devel-
opment can decrease the fitness status of one
neuron (or one subpopulation of neurons) that
upregulate FlowerLoseB. We hypothesize that in the
course of neurodegeneration induced by b-amy-
loid, neurons enter a period of suboptimality,
characterized by a low fitness status and upregu-
lation of the FlowerLoseB isoform.

Cell Reports 25, 3661–3673, December 26, 2018
 Accumulation of amyloid peptides in the brain is thought to be
the first step in Alzheimer’s pathogenesis. Whereas Ab42 is the
main component of amyloid plaques found in human patients,
Ab40 is a shorter isoform of the human amyloid peptide that is
less amyloidogenic. Ab40 does not deposit as soluble oligomeric
aggregates in Drosophila and does not cause neurodegenera-
tion in vivo (Iijima et al., 2004; Speretta et al., 2012). When over-
expressed in the Drosophila brain using GMR-Gal4, Ab40 did not
alter the levels of the FlowerLoseB reporter (Figures 2I–2L). We
decided to focus on Ab42-associated toxicity from now on
because the levels of azot and flower were most affected by
this peptide.
Ab42-Producing Clones Are Eliminated over Time from a
Neuronal Epithelium
To determine whether Ab42 induces cell elimination when ex-
pressed in clones, we induced its expression by heat shock in
clones marked by GFP in the neuroepithelium of the eye disc.
We registered that Ab42-producing clones are progressively
excluded from the tissue and detected a higher proportion of
dying cells marked by Drosophila caspase-protein 1 (DCP1) in-
side these clones (Figures 3A and 3D–3F). FlowerLoseB::mCherry
and Azot::mCherry were mainly detected inside Ab42-producing
clones, but some signal was present outside clone borders (Fig-
ures 3B, 3C, 3E, and 3F). We found that Ab42 largely diffused out
of clone borders and accumulated at the basal side of the eye
discs, explaining non-autonomous induction of flower and azot
(Figure S2D). FlowerLoseB::mCherry and Azot::mCherry were
not detected in control clones expressing an innocuous trans-
gene (Figure 3C). As expected, the cleaved form of DCP1 co-
localized with FlowerLoseB::mCherry, showing that unfit cells
affected by Ab42 were undergoing apoptosis (Figure 3E;
Figure S2E).
flower and azot Are Necessary for Ab42-Induced
Neuronal Death
Next, we analyzed Ab42-associated toxicity and neuronal loss in
the adult brain. GMR-driven Ab42 induces cell death in the optic
lobe over time, eliciting a 2.8-fold increase in the number of pos-
itive cells for activated DCP1, which co-localized with the
neuronal marker ELAV, compared to control flies 2 weeks after
eclosion (Figures 4B and 4C).
The presence of FlowerLoseB isoforms at the cell membrane of
a particular neuron does not imply that the cell will die (Merino
et al., 2013; Moreno et al., 2015; Rhiner et al., 2010) (Figure 4A).
Cell death is initiated only if relative fitness differences with
neighboring neurons persist (Levayer et al., 2015; Merino et al.,
2013; Rhiner et al., 2010), which requires downstream transcrip-
tional activation of azot (Merino et al., 2015) (Figure 4A).
To check whether neuronal fitness comparisons mediate
Ab42-induced death, we modulated flower and azot genetic
dosages. We found that suppressing relative differences of
FlowerLoseB levels among cells by silencing LoseA/B isoforms
via a long hairpin (Merino et al., 2013) is sufficient to induce a
strong decrease in total apoptosis detected upon Ab42 expres-
sion in the adult brain, bringing it back to almost wild-type levels
(Figures 4B and 4C). Silencing azot with RNAi also reduced the
cell death observed in the presence of Ab42 alone, bringing it
back to almost wild-type levels (Figures 4B and 4C).
As a positive control for inhibition of apoptosis, we used UAS-
dIAP1 (>dIAP1), an antagonist of the apoptotic pathway in
Drosophila (Hay et al., 1995). Bulk cell death in GMR > Ab42 adult
optic lobes was suppressed by overexpression of dIAP1
(Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis 1) (Figures 4B and 4C). We
confirmed that part of apoptotic cells marked by DCP1 co-
localize with Azot::mCherry in a GMR > Ab42 background
(Figure S1C). These results were supported by an equivalent
experiment conducted in the eye imaginal disc of the larva (Fig-
ures S3A and S3B), showing that Ab42-associated cell death is
mediated by flower and azot. Moreover, we found that the
fitness-based neuronal elimination induced by neurodegenera-
tion is not specific to Ab42 and occurs in HttQ128-associated
degeneration (Figures S3C and S3D).
To study how neuronal fitness is affected over time, we moni-
tored cumulative azot expression during aging of GMR > Ab42
brains with the reporter line azot{KO;GFP}. This reporter allows
visualization of impaired cells (GFP+) that activate the azot pro-
moter (Merino et al., 2015). Using this tool, we observed that
GFP signal is only detected in FlowerLoseB-positive cells (Fig-
ure S1D). Optic lobes overexpressing Ab42 accumulate GFP-
positive cells at an increased rate compared to control brains
of identical ages lacking Ab42 (53%, 70%, and 96% increase
over the wild-type of the same age at 5, 15, and 30 days, respec-
tively) (Figures 4D and 4E). Altogether, this shows that Ab42
expression leads to a progressive generation of neurons that
will be targeted to death via azot (Figure 4A).
Suppression of Fitness-Based Removal of Ab42-
Damaged Neurons Aggravates Accumulation of
Degenerative Vacuoles and Decreases Lifespan
Next, we asked about the consequences of blocking fitness-
based elimination of Ab42-damaged cells for aging, locomo-
tion, and cognition. First, we established a model in which
expression of Ab42 is restricted to adult neurons; to this end,
we generated flies containing the Ab42 cassette under the
control of the inducible promoter elav-GeneSwitch (elavGS)
(Figure 5A) (Poirier et al., 2008; Roman et al., 2001). We de-
tected Ab42 accumulation in the optic lobe and mushroom
body calyx of elavGS > Ab42 adult flies fed for 5 days on the
GeneSwitch-activator RU486, but not in the brain of uninduced
flies (Figure 5B; Figure S4A). Ab42 aggregates stained positive
for aggresome markers (Figure S4B), confirming the amyloido-
genic nature of human Ab42 when secreted by Drosophila
neurons.

 Apoptosis was increased in the optic lobes of 10-day-old
adults raised on RU486 (Figure S4G) compared to uninduced
flies. TUNEL-positive cells co-localized with ELAV, indicating
that Ab42 caused neuronal death (Figure S4G). RU486 did not
cause apoptosis on its own (Figures S4C and S4D). Increased
cell death was not accompanied by elevated proliferation,
consistent with little regeneration occurring in uninjured adult
brains (Ferna
´ ndez-Herna
´ ndez et al., 2013) (Figures S4E and
S4F).
Brains of induced elavGS > Ab42 flies showed hallmarks of
neurodegeneration, such as increased number of degenera-
tive vacuoles (Figures 5C and 5D). In induced elavGS >
Ab42 flies, the total number of vacuoles was the double
that of elavGS>lacZ control flies of the same age (Figures
5C and 5D). azot knockdown in induced elavGS > Ab42
aggravated brain degeneration and caused a 57% increase
in the total number of neurodegenerative vacuoles (Figures
5C and 5D) Conversely, when induced elavGS > Ab42 flies
were provided with a third functional copy of azot, which is
known to accelerate the elimination of unfit cells (Merino
et al., 2015), brain architecture was restored and the number
of vacuoles dropped 30% (Figures 5C and 5D). Finally, we
suppressed apoptosis by overexpressing dIAP1, together
with Ab42, in adult neurons and observed that brains deterio-
rated faster than in induced elavGS > Ab42 flies alone (Figures
5C and 5D).
To rescue brain morphology, we used the azot{KO;hid} trans-
genic line, which contains the coding sequence of the pro-
apoptotic gene hid inserted into the azot KO locus, leading to
hid transcription under the control of azot endogenous enhancer
sequences (Merino et al., 2015). The total size of vacuoles in the
brain of induced elavGS > Ab42/ azot{KO;hid} flies, which lack
Azot protein but still eliminate unfit cells via transcription of hid,
was significantly decreased at 2 weeks, proving azot has a role
mainly dedicated to apoptosis regulation in the course of neuro-
degeneration (Figures S5A and S5B).

 The observation that suppression of apoptosis led to acceler-
ated vacuole formation in the brain made us speculate that cells
may be undergoing alternative forms of cell death, such as
necrosis. To test this hypothesis, we followed a protocol using
propidium iodide (PI) that can penetrate compromised mem-
branes of necrotic cells (Liu et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2013). We
detected an increased number of cells permeable to PI in the
brains of elavGS > Ab42 flies two weeks after induction,
comparing to non-induced flies, indicating that Ab42 can trigger
necrosis in the brain (Figure S5C). However, blocking apoptosis
by either overexpression of dIAP1 or knockout of azot did not
lead to a further increase in the levels of necrosis, making necro-
sis an unlikely cause of accelerated vacuole formation in these
genotypes (Figure S5C).
When analyzing life expectancy of elavGS > Ab42 flies, we
confirmed that secreted Ab42 is detrimental for longevity (Fig-
ures 5E and 5F): induced flies lived on average 40 days versus
52 days for uninduced flies. Life expectancy of induced elavGS
> Ab42 flies dropped to 20 days when azot expression was
silenced by RNAi (representing a 51% decrease in mean survival
compared with elavGS > Ab42 flies carrying a wild-type dose of
azot) (Figures 5E and 5F). It was not possible to determine a clear
effect of diap1 overexpression on longevity or in combination
with Ab42 (data not shown). Apoptosis is involved in many bio-
logical processes with potentially opposing consequences for
lifespan.
An Extra Copy of azot Is Sufficient to Restore Motor
Coordination and Improve Long-Term Memory
Formation
We studied the consequences of fitness-based neuronal culling
on walking behavior. Using tracking software (Colomb et al.,
2012), we extracted several behavioral parameters from 5 min
walking sessions of individual flies (Figure 6A). elavGS > Ab42
flies induced for two weeks on RU486 showed decreased
activity time, shorter walks, and ataxia (Figure 6B) compared
to uninduced elavGS > Ab42 flies (Videos S1 and S2). Expres-
sion of azot RNAi significantly exacerbated behavioral and
locomotor dysfunctions caused by Ab42 alone (Figures 6A
and 6B). On the contrary, an extra copy of azot was sufficient
to restore the behavioral defects observed in elavGS > Ab42
flies, including lengths of walks, activity time, and ataxia (Figures
6A and 6B; Video S3). Finally, blocking apoptosis with UAS-
diap1 in elavGS > Ab42 individuals compromised walking per-
formance (Figures 6A and 6B), whereas dIAP1 overexpression
alone did not result in impaired locomotion (Figure S6A).
To assess long-term memory (LTM) formation, we used court-
ship suppression assays (Keleman et al., 2007; Siegel and Hall,
1979). Courtship conditioning is a form of associative learning
by which male flies have to recall that they were previously
rejected by a mated-unreceptive female and reduce courtship
activity when re-exposed (Figure 7A). Because prolonged Ab42
expression resulted in locomotion defects, we reduced Ab42
induction by one week to ensure that all naive control males
reached a courtship index of 0.6–0.8 (courting 60%–80% of
the observation period) (Figure 7B), normally seen in wild-type
sham controls (Nichols et al., 2012). Presence of RU486 did
not affect LTM formation of elavGS flies without the Ab42 trans-
gene (data not shown). We measured a significant difference in
courtship index between sham and trained males for all geno-
types except for elavGS > Ab42, azotKO�/� flies (Figure 7B).
One week-induced elavGS > Ab42 flies showed impaired LTM
formation compared to uninduced flies (Videos S4 and S5),
which was strongly aggravated in the absence of azot (Figures
7B and 7C; Video S6). Additional expression of > diap to block
cell death had a detrimental effect on LTM (but not a statistically
significant one) (Figure 7C; Video S7). Conversely, introduction
of an extra copy of azot, which increases the efficiency of cell
culling (Merino et al., 2015), was sufficient to restore robust
LTM formation in Ab42-expressing flies (Figures 7C and 7D;
Video S8), resulting in significant improvement of memory
compared to elavGS > Ab42 / > lacZ flies. These results underline
that azot-mediated clearance of neurons is beneficial for motor
and cognitive functions affected by adult onset of Ab42 expres-
sion. Moreover, introduction of a single extra copy of azot was
sufficient to prevent Ab42-induced motor and cognitive decline
(Figure 7D).
In flies, the mushroom body (MB) is important for learning and
memory (Aso et al., 2014). To investigate whether the previously
observed memory defects were caused by altered mushroom
body architecture, we revealed mushroom body structure using
an anti-Fasciclin II (FasII) antibody, which strongly labels the
a and b lobes (Crittenden et al., 1998; Fushima and Tsujimura,
2007). We analyzed all genotypes after one week of Ab42 in-
duction when memory phenotypes were evident, but we did
not find strong changes in mushroom body structure. In partic-
ular, elavGS > Ab42, azotKO�/� flies did not exhibit severe
morphological defects despite the strong memory impairment
(Figure S6B). We observed a modest variability among individ-
uals of the same genotype and depicted mild alterations in lobes
of the mushroom body, which were comparable among geno-
types (Figure S6B). This result suggests that memory differences

(A) Neurons compute relative levels of FlowerLoseB to determine its fate. Neurons expressing LoseB and surrounded by neurons with equal levels of LoseB do not
activate azot transcription. If the neuron cannot cope with an insult and exhibits persistently higher levels of LoseB compared to neighboring neurons, it will fail to
pass a fitness checkpoint mediated by the azot gene and will be purged from the tissue. Increased copies of azot enhance fitness-based cell elimination.

 between genotypes are not a result of mushroom body malfor-
mation but rather a consequence of a genetic interaction be-
tween Ab42 and azot.
DISCUSSION
Here, we report that expression of misfolding-prone toxic pep-
tides linked to AD and Huntington’s disease affects neuronal
fitness and triggers competition between neurons, leading to
increased activation of the FlowerLoseB isoform and Azot in
Drosophila neural tissues. Our results demonstrate that fitness
fingerprints are important physiological mediators of neuronal
death occurring in the course of neurodegenerative diseases.
This mechanism is associated with specific toxic peptides or
with particular stages of the neurodegenerative disease, because
competition is not elicited by expression of Parkinson-related
a-Synuclein, for instance. Our results suggest that the toxic ef-
fects of agiven peptide correlate directly with the level of neuronal
competition and death it induces.
Surprisingly, we found that neuronal death had a beneficial ef-
fect against b-amyloid-dependent cognitive and motor decline.
This finding challenges the commonly accepted idea that
neuronal death is detrimental at all stages of the disease pro-
gression.
We
found
that
most
amyloid-induced
neuronal
apoptosis is beneficial and likely acts to remove damaged and/
or dysfunctional neurons in an attempt to protect neural circuits
from
aberrant
neuronal
activation
and
impaired
synaptic
transmission.
One curious observation in our study is that Ab42 induces cell
death both autonomously and non-autonomously in clones of
the eye disc. Dying cells co-localize with FlowerLoseB reporter
both inside and outside of GFP-marked clones of the larva. We
observed that Ab42 peptide is secreted to regions outside of
clone borders and accumulates at the basal side of the eye
disc. The neurons of the eye disc that project their axons into
the optic stalk through the basal side of the disc are likely
affected by the accumulation of the toxic peptide, explaining
the induction of cell death outside of clones.
We observed that blocking apoptosis in Ab42 expressing flies
by either azot silencing or overexpression of dIAP1 increases the
number of vacuoles in the brains of these flies. This seems to be
a counterintuitive observation, because one would expect that a
reduction in apoptosis would result in fewer cells being lost and a
reduction of neurodegenerative vacuoles. However, this obser-
vation can be conciliated with our model: we suspect that less
fit neurons have impaired dendritic growth and inhibit the expan-
sion of neighboring neurons. This inhibition would disappear
once the unfit neuron is culled, allowing compensatory dendritic
growth and neuropil extension.
Introduction of a single extra copy of azot was sufficient to
prevent Ab42-induced motor and cognitive decline, which may
suggest new venues for AD treatment that aim to support elimi-
nation of dysfunctional neurons at early stages of AD pathology.
For example, in patients at early symptomatic stages, when
cognitive impairment is first detected, enhancing physiological
apoptotic pathways using Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL inhibitors, or promot-
ing the cell competition pathway described here, may have strik-
ingly beneficial effects.

 METHOD DETAILS
Generation of flowerLoseB::mCherry and azot::mCherry reporter
The flowerLoseB::mCherry knock-in was made by genomic engineering (Baena-Lopez et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2009). The genomic
engineering by Huang is a 2-step process consisting of ends-out gene targeting followed by phage integrase phi31-mediated DNA
integration. A founder knock-out line was established with a genomic deletion of the flower locus at position 3L: 1’5816’737-
15810028. A knock-in construct containing the deleted flower locus fused with mCherry after exon 6 (specific for flowerLoseB isoform)
was integrated in the KO line. The knock-in construct was done by site directed mutagenesis to remove the stop codon of exon 6 and
add a restriction site to clone mCherry. The knock-out of flower and the knock-in flowerLoseB::mCherry were proven by PCR. Vectors
used for generating the flowerLoseB::mCherry were as following: pGX-attP: (Knock-out vector), pGEM-T (used for the site directed
mutagenesis and insertion of mCherry) and pGEattBGMR (Knock- in vector).
Primers used were the following: AAGCGGCCGCAGCAGCAACAACAGCAGCAACG and AAGCGGCCGCACCGTTCAATATG
CAGGCGGC (50 arm flower amplification), GGAGATCTGGATGATTCCTGAGCTGCGGTAT and AACTGCAGATGGGGACACCTAAA
GAGGCACC (30 arm flower amplification),
AACTATATTGGGCCGGCCAAGCTAACCGAATGCAAGAGGAACCGGAACCTA and GCATTCGGTTAGCTTGGCCGGCCCAATA
TAGTTTCTCACTAAAAATATATGCTTGC (mutagenesis primers), TAGGGCCGGCCATGGTGTCCAAGGGCGAAG and ATGGCCGG
CCCTTATTTATACAGCTCGTCCATGC (mCherry amplification), ACATAGATCTATAAAAGCTTTCAATGTACACAAATTTG and AGC
TGGCGCGCCAAAAAGCATGCCCCACAATAGTTAC (for flower KI).
The azot::mCherry reporter was generated by fusion PCR to combine mCherry coding sequence to azot genomic region, including
2430bps upstream of the start codon, the full azot exon and 175 bp at the 30 UTR. azot genomic region was amplified from the Bac
clone CH321-21G13 (http://pacmanfly.org/) using the following primers: TTGCTTAGACTGTGGCCAGAG and CTCTTCGCCC
TTGGACACCATTCGCATTGTCATCATGTTGACGA for 50 region and azot exon; GACATCTTCTCGCCCAGGTTG and ATGGACGA
GCTGTATAAATAACCTCCATGTGAGTACTCGTA for 30 UTR; GAGATCTCGACGTTCATACGGACGGACAGGCAGACGGAAGGAC
and ACTGCATATAACATGCGCGAGA for the promoter region of azot. mCherry was amplified from c5_stable2_neo vector with
primers TCAACATGATGACAATGCGAATGGTGTCCAAGGGCGAAGAG and ACGAGTACTCACATGGAGGTTATTTATACAGCTCG
TCCATG. The final construct was obtained by two rounds of fusion PCRs (first with primers TAGGCGCGCCCCGCTCATTGTTTC
CAAAGTGATTTTC and GCCGCTAGCGTATGAACGTCGAGATCTCGG; second with primers ACTGCATATAACATGCGCGAGA
and TAGGCGCGCCCCGCTCATTGTTTCCAAAGTGATTTTC) and was cloned in pGEattBGMR with the restriction sites NheI
and AscI.
Immunohistochemistry and image acquisition
Wandering third instar larvae were collected and eye imaginal discs dissected. For clone induction, larvae were given a heat shock at
37�C 48h or 72h before dissection. For pupal dissections, white prepupae (0hr) were collected and maintained at 25�C for 40h.
Dissections were performed in chilled PBS, samples were fixed for 30min in formaldehyde (4% v/v in PBS) and permeabilized
with PBT 0,4%Triton.
The primary antibodies and fluorescent reagents used in this study are listed in the Key Resources Table. TUNEL staining (Roche)
was performed according to the supplier’s protocol and modified as previously (Lolo et al., 2012). For detection of protein inclusions,
brains were fixed and permeabilized as described above and incubated for 1h30min with the proteostat aggresome dye (Enzo Life
Sciences) before mounting. For the necrosis assay, brains were dissected in PBS 1X and incubated for 30min at room temperature
with 10 mg/ml propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma-Aldrich) in Schneider medium, following by washing and standard fixation ((Liu et al., 2014;
Yang et al.,2013)). Samples were mounted in Vectashield (Vectorlab) and imaged on a Leica confocal SP5 or a Zeiss LSM 880 using a
20X dry objective or a 40X oil objective.
Longevity Assays and brain morphology
To minimize disturbing neural development and reduce differences on the genetic background, the RU486-inducible GeneSwitch
system was employed (Osterwalder et al., 2001; Roman et al., 2001). The stock solution of RU486 (Mifepristone, Sigma, prepared
in 80% ethanol) was diluted in MiliQ water to a final concentration of 100 mM and 300 mL of the diluted solution was added to the
surface of the fly food and allowed to dry at room temperature for 48-36h (Poirier et al., 2008). For the mock solution, 80% ethanol
was diluted 10X in water. For survivorship analysis, newly eclosed flies were transferred to bottles and allowed to mate for 2 days at
25�C (He and Jasper, 2014; Linford et al., 2013). Females were then sorted into groups of 15-20 (more than 100 flies in total were used
per genotype) and placed at 29�C into vials containing standard food supplemented either with RU468 or mock solution. Flies were
transferred to new food every 2-3 days and dead/censored animals were counted. For brain morphology analysis, males were
subjected to the same protocol, aged at 29�C until the required stage and dissected. To quantify number of azot-expressing cells
with azot{KO;GFP}, newly eclosed males were collected and kept at 25�C to age for 5, 15 or 30 days.
Behavioral assays
Detailed protocol and further description of the Buridan’s arena can be found elsewhere (Colomb and Brembs, 2014; Colomb et al.,
2012). Shortly, 2 weeks-old females, kept in a 12/12 hours light/dark regime, were raised on standard or RU486-containing food. The

 day before measurements, flies were CO2 -anaesthetized (max 5 min) and their wings were cut with surgical scissors at two thirds of
their length. For recordings, flies were placed in the center of the Buridan’s platform in a dark room. The walking activity of each
individual fly was recorded for 5 minutes with the Buritrack software (http://buridan.sourceforge.net). Individual tests were re-inital-
ized when flies jumped from the platform or exhibited grooming behavior. Walking behavior was analyzed with the CeTrAn software
V4 (https://github.com/jcolomb/CeTrAn/releases/tag/v.4).
Long-term memory (Courtship suppression assay): The repeat training courtship assay was used to assess 24 hour long-term
memory formation as published previously (Fitzsimons et al., 2013). Briefly, a training session was conducted by coupling individual
males with a freshly mated female for a period of seven hours, while sham males were housed alone and served as controls to verify
that courtship activity of a specific genotype was intact. Males were induced on RU486 food for one week, which was previously
shown to be sufficient to induce the elavGS driver and elicit Ab42 expression in fly heads (Rogers et al., 2012). After 24 hours, all
males, trained and sham, were coupled with new mated females and courtship activity was measured over a period of ten minutes
as the percentage of time spent courting (courtship index, CI)(Reza et al., 2013). A memory index (MI) was then calculated as the ratio
between the CI of every trained male and the mean value of the CI of the sham males of the same genotype. A range of scores
between zero and one was obtained, with zero indicating good memory and one indicating memory similar to a sham control(Ejima
and Griffith, 2007), e.g., no memory. Normal memory is generally characterized by a MI of 0.5-0.7 (Fitzsimons et al., 2013). Collected
flies were flipped onto fresh food every two days and kept at 25�C in a 12 hr light/dark cycle. elavGS > Ab flies on standard food
served as uninduced control. In all experiments, the experimenter was blind to the genotype of the flies. Experiments were performed
under ambient light at 25�C with 65%–70% relative humidity and recorded for 10min using a camcorder (Sony Handycam HDR
PJ410).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Image quantification was done with Fiji. The number of positive cells in the adult brain for DCP1, TUNEL, FlowerLoseB::mCherry, Flow-
erLoseB::RFP or Azot::mCherry was counted on 40-mm-wide maximum projections including the anterior part of the optic lobe. Noise
signal was removed using a Gaussian blur filter (sigma = 1) and/or applying a background subtraction (rolling = 20). GFP expressing
cells in azot{KO;GFP} flies were assumed to be GFP-positive particles wider than 9pixels on a 25 mm-thick projection (showing a
141 mm2 field) of the optic lobe. Measure of death induction in eye imaginal discs was done by counting the number of TUNEL positive
particles in 10 mm-thick maximum projections. Spaces between phalloidin staining with an area > 25 mm2 were assumed to be neuro-
degenerative vacuoles. Presence of vacuoles was quantified two weeks after eclosion at a 10 mm deep ventral plane located in the
central brain (next to the mushroom body).
Survival curves
For statistical analysis, a log-rank test (Mantel Cox) was applied to determine significant differences between survival curves.
Walking behavior data was analyzed by an ANOVA model, which was validated posthoc with Tukey-Anscombe plot and QQ plot of
the residuals. p values were calculated comparing all experimental genotypes with each other and corrected for multiple testing using
Holm’s method (Holm, 1979). The variables distance, activity time, and turning angle were chosen for analysis based on previous test
experiments.
Courtship suppression assay, raw data was subjected to arcsine transformation in order to obtain a normal distribution and the
memory indexes of each genotype were subjected to a one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni and Holm’s correction by comparing
genotypes to elavGS > Ab induced controls. When comparing only two genotypes, the Student’s t test (two-tailed, unpaired) was
used. Significance was set at p < 0.05.
The distribution of the number of positive cells (for DCP1, FlowerLoseB::mCherry, FlowerLoseB::RFP or Azot::mCherry) in the optic
lobes of adult flies was analyzed for statistical significant differences between groups with a Kruskal-Wallis test and a Dunn’s test was
applied for multiple comparisons between genotypes. The number of brain vacuoles per hemisphere was analyzed for homogeneity
between genotypes with a Levene test and p values were calculated with one way ANOVA and a Dunnett’s posthoc test. To deter-
mine statistical differences between genotypes for the number of TUNEL positive cells in eye discs, a one-way ANOVA test, followed
by a Dunnett’s posthoc were applied. When only two groups were compared and data did not follow a normal distribution assessed
by d’Agostino-Pearson omnibus test, statistical significance was accessed with a Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test (for example
in the quantification of TUNEL positive cells in the adult brain, GFP positive cells in the optic lobe and clone area). The number of PH3
positive cells was analyzed with an unpaired t test with Welch’s correction. All graphs are displayed as mean ± standard error.
