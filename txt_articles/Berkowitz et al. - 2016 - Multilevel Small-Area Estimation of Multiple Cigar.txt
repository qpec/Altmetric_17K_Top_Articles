Abstract
Background: Smoking is the leading preventable cause of
death; however, small-area estimates for detailed smoking
status are limited. We developed multilevel small-area estimate
mixed models to generate county-level estimates for six smok-
ing status categories: current, some days, every day, former,
ever, and never.
Method: Using 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System (BRFSS) data (our sample size ¼ 405,233 persons),
we constructed and fitted a series of multilevel logistic
regression models and applied them to the U.S. Census
population to generate county-level prevalence estimates.
We mapped the estimates by sex and aggregated them into
state and national estimates. We conducted comparisons for
internal consistency with BRFSS states' estimates using Pear-
son correlation coefficients, and external validation with the
2012 National Health Interview Survey current smoking
prevalence.
Results: Correlation coefficients ranged from 0.908 to 0.982,
indicating high internal consistency. External validation indicated
complete agreement (prevalence ¼ 18.06%). We found large
variations in current and former smoking status between and
within states and by sex. County prevalence of former smokers
was highest among men in the Northeast, North, and West. Utah
consistently had the lowest smoking prevalence.
Conclusions: Our models, which include demographic and
geographic characteristics, provide reliable estimates that can be
applied to multiple category outcomes and any demographic
group. County and state estimates may help understand the
variation in smoking prevalence in the United States and provide
information for control and prevention.
Impact: Detailed county and state smoking category esti-
mates can help identify areas in need of tobacco control and
prevention and potentially allow planning for health care.

Introduction
Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of pre-
mature death in the United States. Studies have shown causal
association between cigarette smoking and multiple cancers,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease,
immune and autoimmune disorders, and nicotine addiction
among former and current smokers. Exposure to secondhand
tobacco smoke has also been causally linked to cancer, respi-
ratory, and cardiovascular diseases, and to adverse effects on
the health of infants and children (1). During 2012 alone,
more than 480,000 Americans died of diseases related to
cigarette smoking. The associated cost of direct medical care
and lost productivity has been estimated to exceed $289
billion (1). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has issued
recommendations for clinicians to ask all adults about smok-
ing, with the aim of providing smokers with behavioral and
pharmacologic treatments for smoking cessation (2). The 2014
Surgeon General's report on the health consequences of smok-
ing described a substantial decline in cigarette smoking among
U.S. adults since 1965 (1). Nevertheless, cigarette smoking
prevalence in 2014 was estimated at 16.8% (3), translating to
40 million people.
National health surveys have provided reliable estimates of
smoking prevalence for large geographic areas such as the entire
United States or the states (4–6). Studies using population
surveys show considerable variation in health outcomes among
states (7). The NCI has estimated county-level prevalence of
current and ever smoking for two aggregated periods, 1997–
1999 and 2000–2003, by combining data from the Behavioral
Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and National Health
Interview Surveys (NHIS; ref. 8). Similarly, researchers at the
University of Washington have used only BRFSS data and
estimated county smoking prevalence for men and women for
each year from 1996 to 2012 to show that the decline in current
cigarette smoking occurred mainly in higher-income counties
with larger populations (9).
The prevalence of current cigarette smoking is routinely
reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) using BRFSS data (10). However, small-area estimates

 (SAE) for detailed smoking status, such as an every day smoker,
some days smoker, or former smoker, are limited.
The purpose of our study is to extend a SAE method based on
a statistical model developed by Zhang and colleagues (11) to
generate county estimates for current smokers, former smokers,
and never smokers, and to further estimate three additional
levels of smoking: ever smoker (former and current), current
every day smoker, and current some days smoker. To our
knowledge, no other study has estimated cigarette smoking
status in such detail.
Materials and Methods
CDC administers BRFSS, a state-based, random-digit-dial
survey, annually in collaboration with health departments in
the states and the District of Columbia to generate reliable
direct estimates. Trained interviewers in each state collect demo-
graphic and health-related information on noninstitutionalized
adults aged 18 years and older through landline or cell phone
interviews. The combined landline and cell phone response
rates to the 2012 BRFSS survey ranged from 27.7% in California
to 60.4% in South Dakota, with a median rate of 45.2%.
Detailed interpretation of the response rate can be found on
the BRFSS website (12). To improve the information about the
sampled population, we poststratified the BRFSS data with the
U.S. Census 2010 population counts (13), which provide the
most current detailed information about a community's pop-
ulation, by age, sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino origin groups.
County-level poverty rates (�150% of the federal poverty rate),
which are a strong predictor of smoking (14, 15), were extracted
from the American Community Survey 5-year county estimates
(2007–2011; ref. 16).
We created six smoking status categories from two BRFSS
questions as our outcomes: "Have you smoked at least 100
cigarettes in your entire life?" If a responder answered "yes," he
or she was further asked, "Do you now smoke cigarettes every
day, some days, or not at all?" We categorized those who
answered "no" to the first question as "never smoker." Those
who answered "every day" or "some days" to the second
question were categorized as "every day smoker" or "some
days smoker," respectively; these two categories combined are
the "current smoker" category. Those who responded "not at
all" were categorized as "former smoker." The final category—
"ever smoker"—is a combination of "every day," "some days,"
and "former" smokers.
Additional information for each respondent in the BRFSS
survey were age (13 age groups: 18–24, 25–29 . . . 75–79, or
�80 years, sex (male or female), and race/ethnicity [eight non-
overlapping groups: non-Hispanic (NH) white, NH black, NH
American Indian or Alaska Native, NH Asian, NH Native Hawai-
ian or other Pacific Islander, NH other single race, NH 2 or more
races, or Hispanic], as well as the respective county (n ¼ 3,143
counties) and state (n ¼ 51; 50 states and the District of Colum-
bia) identifiers.
Data analysis
To estimate the expected probability of individual smoking
status in the United States, in each county nested in a state, we
used the 2012 BRFSS data to construct a series of three mul-
tilevel logistic mixed models with the whole population, the
population of ever smokers, and the population of current
smokers. The second and third models progressively included a
subset of the previous model's population. Each model includ-
ed both individual-level fixed effects (age, sex, race/ethnicity),
and county-level poverty, and county- and state-level random
effects.
The results from each of these three models included
parameters for 13 age categories, 2 sex categories, 8 race/
ethnicity categories, county-level poverty, and county- and
state-level random effects. We then defined for any county-
level i with a missing estimate a county-level random effect
mi
c by spatially smoothing its adjacent counties' random
effects mj
c (j „ i) and averaging them (17). These newly
created county random effects were linked back to the county
random effect list.
The estimated parameters from the three models and the
updated county random effects were applied in three newly
constructed Monte Carlo simulation programs, for which we
randomly drew 1,000 samples for each of the parameters
and their standard errors, to predict the individual-level
expected probability of each smoking category (see model
specification below). The county-level random effects in
these simulation programs represented the county contextual
effects on the outcome rather than one factor for the whole
county.
Our multilevel logistic regression models for the prevalence of
the six smoking status categories followed the general formula of
generalized linear mixed models as follows (11):
Let Pijkcs(Yijkcs) be the probability of an individual having a
smoking status assumed to be associated with three level-
related factors—individual, county, and state—via the logit
link function:
Pijkcs(Yijkcs
1 ¼ 1) ¼ logit�1(ai þ bj þ gk þ x'
ch þ mc þ us þ eijkcs).
Yijkcs
1 is the self-reported smoking status (1 ¼ yes, 0 ¼ no) for an
individual in age group i, i ¼ 1 to 13, sex group j, j ¼ 1, 2, and race/
ethnicity group k, k ¼ 1 to 8 from county c in state s; ai, bj, and gk
are the regression coefficients of age group i, sex group j, and race/
ethnicity group k, respectively. xc is a vector of county-level
covariates, and h is a vector of their respective regression coeffi-
cients. The prediction model included a product of the county-
level poverty status x0
c and the regression coefficient h of the
county-level poverty status. mc, us, and eijkcs are the county-level,
state-level, and individual residual random effects, which were
assumed to be independent and normally distributed.
Model 1 included the entire population and was defined as
the general model above with self-reported smoking status
Yijkcs
1 [1 ¼ ever smoker (former, current every day, or current
some days), 0 ¼ never smoker]. Model 2 included the popu-
lation of ever smokers [1 ¼ current (every day and some days),
0 ¼ former smoker], and model 3 included the population of
current smokers (1 ¼ every day smoker, 0 ¼ some days
smoker). Additional details of the models are presented in
Supplementary Methods and Materials.
Aggregating the results for the county-level SAEs into larger
units of geography allowed us to estimate prevalence of each
smoking status category for each state and the entire United States.
We calculated summary statistics (mean, median, first and third
quartiles, interquartile range, minimum, maximum, and range)
for the model-based county distributions for each smoking status
category, for its total population and by sex, using the univariate

 procedure. In addition, we mapped the results for four of the
model-based county smoking distributions (every day, some
days, former, and never) to provide insights into geographic
patterns. We conducted external validation of our estimates by
comparing our U.S. current smoking estimates with the 2012
NHIS estimates (18). We also evaluated the internal consistency
between states' model estimates and the corresponding direct
BRFSS estimates with Pearson correlation coefficients. Summary
statistics for states' SAE and direct BRFSS estimates were calculated
with the MEANS procedure.
The BRFSS multilevel models were fitted with the SAS
GLIMMIX procedure (SAS Institute, Inc.). The multilevel sim-
ulation models were performed with SAS Ver. 9.3. The calculation
of the BRFSS states' summary estimates for internal consistency, as
well as of the NHIS estimates for external validation, was per-
formed with SAS-callable SUDAAN (Research Triangle Institute,
Research Triangle Park, NC).
Results
The 2012 BRFSS survey included information from a sample of
475,687 adults, with state-level sample sizes ranging from 4,390
in Alaska to 21,895 in Massachusetts. After excluding missing
records for age, race, smoking, and county-level poverty rate,
the total sample size for our analysis was 405,223. Our post-
stratification included U.S. Census 2010 population data from all
3,143 U.S. counties.
Model-based SAEs and external validation
The model-based SAE for overall 2012 current smoking prev-
alence in the United States was 18.06% (Table 1), the same as the
prevalence estimate reported by NHIS for that year. The direct
BRFSS estimate of current smoking prevalence in 2012 was
18.85%.
The model-based SAEs for current smoking prevalence for men
and women were 21.20% and 16.41%, respectively, and within
the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the corresponding NHIS
prevalence estimates (20.49%, 95% CI, 19.61%–21.39% and
15.81%, 95% CI, 15.10%–16.56%). The direct BRFSS 2012
estimates for men and women were 21.32% and 16.52%,
respectively.
Results from our model-based SAEs at the county level
revealed large variations in the estimated prevalence of current
smoking, ranging from 5.76% to 42.02%, with a median of
19.53%. The county-level mean current smoking prevalence
was an estimated 22.46% for males and 17.46% for females,
with an overall percentage range of 39.04% and 33.74%,
respectively. This percentage difference by gender held for every
day, some days, and former smokers both for the U.S. overall
and county-level means.
Our analysis also showed that, in 2012, the U.S. overall and the
county-level mean estimate of never smokers was higher among
women than among men (62.56% vs. 50.83% and 60.86% vs.
49.10%, respectively). In addition, county-level never smoking
prevalence ranged from a minimum of 33.42% for men to a
maximum of 87.24% for women, and the median for women was
nearly 12% higher than that of men.
More than half of those classified as ever smokers were former
smokers. More men than women were former smokers (27.97%
vs. 21.04%, respectively, for the U.S. overall and 28.44% vs.
21.69%, respectively, for the counties).
Model-based SAEs versus direct BRFSS estimates for the
assessment of internal consistency
The Pearson correlation coefficients between our state-level
model-based SAEs for the entire United States and the direct
BRFSS survey estimates ranged from 0.908 for some days
smokers to 0.982 for former smokers (Table 2), indicating high
internal consistency. The correlation coefficients for men ran-
ged from 0.857 for ever smoker (and never smoker, which is the
complement to the whole population studied) to 0.919 for
every day smoker. Correlation coefficients for women ranged
from 0.816 for some days smokers to 0.957 for every day
smokers. Except for the correlation for some days smokers,
women's correlation coefficients were higher than those of
men. Comparison between summary statistics for the states'
model-based estimates with those of BRFSS for each smoking
category showed that the estimates were similar, with the BRFSS
estimates being slightly higher.
Geographic variation in estimated current and former
smoking prevalence among the 50 states, DC, and
the 3,143 counties
Utah consistently had the lowest prevalence of current smoking
overall (9.64%) and for men (11.24%) and women (8.05%; Table
3). The remaining nine states with the lowest prevalence were
grouped in the West and Northwest (Hawaii, California, Washing-
ton, Oregon, and Idaho), the Northeast (Vermont, Connecticut,
and New Hampshire), and Maryland. The highest prevalence of
current smoking was observed in part of the Midwest and in the
South and, particularly in West Virginia (24.81% overall, 27.79%
for men, and 21.96% for women) and Kentucky (24.56% overall,
27.52% for men, and 21.76% for women). The remaining states
with the highest prevalence of current smoking among men and
women also included Alabama, Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas,
Oklahoma, Indiana, Louisiana, Ohio, and Mississippi. The prev-
alence among females was consistently lower than that of males.
Consistent with the estimates of state-specific current smoking
prevalence, the counties with the lowest prevalence were in Utah
and California (<10%, data not shown). The counties with the
highest prevalence of current smoking (>33%) were in Arkansas,
South Dakota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin, even though the
latter three states were not among the those with the highest
current smoking prevalence. Additional findings show variation
of smoking levels in Arizona, New Mexico, and states in the
Northwest and North, and by sex (Fig. 1). The majority of current
smokers were every day smokers. Although the county every day
smoking prevalence was higher among men than among women,
most of the counties where the prevalence was highest among
men were the same as those with the highest prevalence among
women. The majority of some days smokers reside in the South, in
some of the counties in Alaska and Nevada, and are more often
men in states in the North and Northeast (Fig. 1).
By state, 15.30% to 30.62% of men and women were classified
as former smokers (Table 4). The highest and lowest estimated
prevalence of former smokers included similar states for the entire
population, and for both sexes, with few variations. Utah had the
lowest estimates: 15.30% for the entire population, 18.26% for
men, and 12.38% for women. Other states with the lowest
percentages of former smokers were Texas, Mississippi, Georgia,
Louisiana, the District of Columbia, Alabama, and Tennessee.
Lower prevalence of former smoking was also observed for men in
Kansas, for both sexes in Idaho, for the entire population and for

 women in California, and for the entire population in Indiana.
The Northeast, on the other hand, had the highest prevalence of
former smokers; Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire led the
states in this region, followed by Connecticut, Rhode Island, and
Massachusetts. Other states with a high prevalence of former
smokers were Florida, Oregon, and South Dakota, for the entire
population and for men and women; Montana for the entire
population and for men; and Delaware for women.
Distributions of former smoking prevalence by county reveal
that counties with highest prevalence of former smoking in men
were similar to the counties with the highest prevalence of former
smoking in women, even though prevalence in men was 8%to 9%
higher than prevalence in women (Fig. 1). Counties with the
lowest prevalence of former smokers were in Utah, Texas, Mis-
sissippi, Idaho, and Kansas. The 10 counties with the lowest
prevalence of former smokers had less than 15% overall (data
not shown). The 10 counties with the highest prevalence of former
smokers had more than 34% and were in Florida, Maine, Ver-
mont, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire (data not shown).
Discussion
We presented an extension of a statistical model to generate
county estimates for six categories of smoking status. We
validated our model-based accuracy by comparing its estimates
to the 2012 NHIS estimates for the entire United States and by
sex, and assessed its internal consistency by comparing its
estimates with the corresponding 2012 BRFSS estimates. Both
our external and internal consistency assessments showed the
model-based SAEs to be reliable. Our findings were in complete
agreement with the NHIS current smoking estimate for the
entire United States and very similar to the NHIS estimates for
men and women. Our model-based SAEs for prevalence of
current smoking were slightly closer to the corresponding
estimates of NHIS than those of BRFSS. Our model-based SAEs
for prevalence of former smoking were slightly higher than
NHIS estimates.
Our findings revealed large variations in the prevalence of
current and former cigarette smoking among states and among
counties in the states. Although the prevalence for both smok-
ing categories was higher among men than women, smoking
distribution patterns were mostly similar and often concentrat-
ed in certain areas or regions of the country. Consistent with a
previous study (9), the highest estimates of current smoking
were in the South and part of the Midwest, including Appala-
chian states (West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee), where a large
percentage of the population is poor with low educational
attainment. These states have the lowest excise tax on cigarettes
in the United States (19), and some are among the biggest
tobacco growers in the United States (20). Other concentrated
areas of high-risk populations were observed in Alaska, several
other states (Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico), and certain coun-
ties within states (South Dakota and North Dakota), with
high poverty rates and large populations of American Indians
(21, 22). State or federal policies to curb tobacco smoking, such
as excise tax, may not apply to Native Americans in their tribal
lands unless authorized by federal law (23, 24), which may
partly explain the higher tobacco use rates and lower cessation
among these vulnerable groups. This finer detail about high
levels of smoking prevalence at the county level highlights areas
for investigation or for comprehensive tobacco control efforts.
An important contribution of our study to the literature and to
county and state planning efforts is data about the distribution
of former smokers, for whom data have been sparse. A signif-
icant proportion of lung cancers arise among former smokers,
even years after smoking cessation (25, 26), and lung cancer
screening is recommended for some former smokers on the
basis of their age, smoking history, and time since quitting
(27). Our model-based SAEs for former smokers highlight
geographic areas where reductions in cigarette smoking have
occurred and areas where additional information (e.g., age,
pack-years, and years since cessation) would be helpful to
determine eligibility for lung cancer screening. Although our
model-based SAEs showed that the largest percentage of former

 smokers resided in more affluent states in the Northeast, where
excise tax is among the highest in the country and cessation or
other programs might exist (28), some of these states also had
the lowest prevalence of current smoking. However, some
counties in this region had very high prevalence of former
smoking. Additional examples show that although few counties
in South Dakota were among the counties with the highest
estimated prevalence of current cigarette smoking, the state as a
whole was among the states with the largest percentage of
former smokers.
Our study has at least two limitations. First, questions are not
currently available on the BRFSS questionnaire to estimate eligi-
bility for lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomog-
raphy, including smoking pack-years or whether a person has
stopped smoking for at least 15 years. More detailed quantifica-
tion of smoking status would potentially provide a more useful
categorization of current and former smoking. Second, BRFSS
data relied on self-reported information, which might have intro-
duced some bias, most likely underestimates.
Using the largest health survey in the United States, BRFSS,
together with county-level poverty data, is a study strength. In
addition, the models combine prediction from a unit-level
(individual-level data as outcomes) with multilevel regression
and post stratification that included both geographic and
demographic characteristics (29, 30). Further, our small-area
estimation method allows better integration with other data
available at the county level, such as data from the American
Community Survey, for more fine-tuned analysis of factors
associated with smoking status. Our modeling design can
provide reliable estimates, is flexible, and can be applied to
more than two categorical outcomes and to any demographic
group. Moreover, our models were based on a method that was
internally and externally validated (31). The county estimates
can be aggregated into larger geographic areas, such as states
and the entire United States.
Providing county and state estimates of all categories of smok-
ing status across the United States will serve to identify areas where
the impact of tobacco control and prevention efforts may be the
greatest and allow planning for health care. Understanding the
variation in smoking prevalence across and within different
geographic units, some of which may have weak tobacco control
policies, can provide information for tailoring proven prevention
efforts (28, 32) to the appropriate population level and for
developing strategies to address interventions at multiple levels.
The results of these model-based estimates can also be used for
models of various health outcomes and with data sources other
than BRFSS.
