Objective: This study aimed to determine the extent to which robotic arm rehabilitation
for chronic stroke may promote recovery of speech and language function in individuals
with aphasia.
Methods:
We prospectively enrolled 17 individuals from a hemiparesis rehabilitation
study pairing intensive robot assisted therapy with sham or active tDCS and evaluated
their speech (N = 17) and language (N = 9) performance before and after a 12-week
(36 session) treatment regimen. Performance changes were evaluated with paired t-tests
comparing pre- and post-test measures. There was no speech therapy included in the
treatment protocol.
Results: Overall, the individuals significantly improved on measures of motor speech
production from pre-test to post-test. Of the subset who performed language testing
(N = 9), overall aphasia severity on a standardized aphasia battery improved from pre-test
baseline to post-test. Active tDCS was not associated with greater gains than sham
tDCS.
Conclusions: This work indicates the importance of considering approaches to stroke
rehabilitation across different domains of impairment, and warrants additional exploration
of the possibility that robotic arm motor treatment may enhance rehabilitation for speech
and language outcomes. Further investigation into the role of tDCS in the relationship
of limb and speech/language rehabilitation is required, as active tDCS did not increase
improvements over sham tDCS.

Robotic Arm Rehab and Aphasia
INTRODUCTION
Following stroke, participation in professional, social, and family
environments is often limited by acquired deficits affecting motor
control, sensation, cognition, and communication. Treatment
in each domain can promote some limited recovery, but
residual disability remains a problem. Thus, there is a need
for efficient interventions to expedite and enhance recovery.
We explored the possibility that treatment in one domain—
motor function—may benefit performance in another, untreated
domain—communication—in individuals with acquired aphasia
and/or apraxia of speech. Synergistic effects of treatment across
domains could provide a transformational approach to stroke
rehabilitation.
The possibility that robotic motor treatment preceded by
tDCS may benefit speech-language recovery was raised by Hesse
et al. (1). They reported that 4 of the 10 individuals with
subacute stroke undergoing repetitive right upper-extremity
robotic arm therapy in conjunction with transcranial direct
current stimulation (tDCS) exhibited unexpected improvement
on a standardized speech-language measure. The present
investigation extended this examination to the chronic stage
of recovery, using tDCS in conjunction with a 12-week course
of right upper-extremity robotic arm therapy. To determine
whether changes in the untreated speech-language domain would
occur in this population, eligible individuals with chronic stroke
(>6 months post onset) were prospectively enrolled. These
participants were a subset of a larger randomized control trial
of hemiparesis recovery using intensive robotic arm treatment
preceded by tDCS.

Diadochokinetic (DDK) severity ratings come from subtest 1 of the Apraxia Battery for Adults, 2nd edition (ABA-2)2 and aphasia diagnoses come from the Revised Western Aphasia
Battery (WAB-R)4 at pre-test baseline.
METHODS
Participants
A subset of seventeen participants (10 M, 7 F) from a large multi-
site RCT were enrolled in the speech and language study reported
here (dates: 4/2013-9/2014). All treatment and assessments were
conducted at Burke Medical Research Institute and Feinstein
Institute for Medical Research with participants consented under
IRB approval of both institutions. Eligibility criteria for the
larger RCT were: a single, left-hemisphere ischemic lesion;
cognitive function sufficient to understand the instructions and
task in the study; and a Motor Power score ranging from
1 to 4/5, indicating that participants were neither hemiplegic
nor had fully recovered motor function in the muscles of the
shoulder, elbow, and/or wrist. Participants in the speech and
language subset also presented with chronic aphasia and/or
apraxia of speech subsequent to the same lesion. Speech-language
testing occurred prior to the beginning of motor therapy (pre-
test baseline) and again after the conclusion of the therapy
sessions (post-test). All 17 speech-language participants were
administered a speech motor control task (i.e., diadochokinetic
rate). Language testing was only conducted on individuals whose
primary language was English (N = 11) because the normative
samples for the measures given are based on native English
speakers. Two English speakers were unable to complete the
full battery at post-test, leaving complete language data sets
for 9 people for the Western Aphasia Battery-R and 10 people
for the category naming task. Speech motor control data for
17 participants is reported here. All participants completed the
entire 36 session hemiparesis protocol.

Robotic Arm Rehab and Aphasia
Testing Battery
Diadochokinesis
Diadochokinetic rate (DDK) assesses the ability to produce
sequential and alternating syllables (e.g., “papapa;” “pataka”). We
used the test version from the Apraxia Battery for Adults 2nd
version (ABA-2) (2) and followed the scoring protocol outlined
in the examiner’s manual.
Category Naming
Participants were given one minute to name members of a
semantic category (animals; transportation; plants; tools). This
frequently used verbal fluency measure requires lexical access and
word retrieval (3). Unimpaired speakers typically produce 20+
category members per minute.
Comprehensive Speech-Language Battery
The Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (WAB-R) (4) is a
comprehensive aphasia battery, and yields an overall “aphasia
quotient” (AQ) indicating aphasia severity (0–100). Scores above
93.8 are within the normal range; changes of 5+ points are
considered clinically significant (5).
Procedure
All participants were enrolled in the double-blind repetitive right
upper-extremity motor therapy study that included 36 sessions
(3x/week) of robotic arm motor therapy (∼1 h each) preceded by
20 min of tDCS. In this study, a 2 mA current was delivered by
a battery-driven current generator using surface rubber-carbon
electrodes (5 × 7 cm; 35 cm2) surrounded by saline-soaked
sponges. The center of the anode was placed 5 cm lateral to the
vertex, and the cathode was placed over the right supraorbital
region. For participants in the sham tDCS condition, current was
ramped up to 2 mA over 30 s and then ramped down to 0 ms (6).
The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FM) (7) scores were obtained pre-
test, post-test, and at a 6-month follow-up (not reported here).
The FM provided a standardized assessment of upper extremity
abilities administered by a licensed occupational therapist or
trained research assistant.
Speech-language tasks were administered by an ASHA-
certified speech-language pathologist (SLP). Participants were
assessed during the week prior to the first treatment session (pre-
test baseline), and within 5 days of the last treatment session
(post-test). The same SLP administered baseline and post-test
evaluations for each participant. Participants did not receive
speech-language therapy as part of the treatment.
Data Analysis
To evaluate changes, we performed two analyses for each speech-
language measure: a within-subjects paired t-test to evaluate
overall change from baseline to post-test; and an independent
samples t-test using the difference scores for each participant
to evaluate tDCS (active∼sham) group differences. Despite the
small sample size, we use t-tests to allow for confidence intervals
to get a sense of the effect size, and we also report the outcomes
of non-parametric Wilcoxon tests throughout the results.

RESULTS
Demographic and stroke information, as well as tests they
completed and tDCS group assignment, are presented in Table 1.
Consistent with the larger data set and prior published studies,
Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FM) (7) scores among these patients
significantly increased following the robotic training regimen
(mean: 27.3 pre, 35.4 post). Mean pre-to-post increase was 8.1

points [95% confidence interval (CI; 6.4, 9.8); t-test: p < 0.001;
Non parametric Wilcoxon: p < 0.001]. As in the full cohort from
the robotic arm study, improvement did not differ between tDCS
and sham arms in the full set of 17 participants (t-test: p = 0.14;
Non parametric Wilcoxon: p = 0.13) or in the subset with WAB
data discussed below (t-test: p = 0.28; Non parametric Wilcoxon:
p = 0.34).
Diadochokinetic (DDK) Task
A paired t-test revealed significant improvement in DDK scores
from baseline to post-test [mean: 3.19 points, CI (1.04, 5.34); t-
test: p = 0.006, Non parametric Wilcoxon p = 0.003; Figure 1A].
There was no difference between participants receiving sham
(N = 8) and active tDCS [N = 8; difference = −0.38, CI (−4.10,
4.85), t-test: p = 0.86].
Category Naming
A paired t-test revealed a significant increase in category
naming scores from baseline to post-test overall [mean: 3.27
items, CI (0.16, 6.39), t-test: p = 0.026, Non parametric
Wilcoxon p = 0.036; Figure 1B]. Participants in the sham
group (N = 5; mean improvement: 6.60 items) improved by
significantly more items than participants in the active tDCS
group [N = 6; mean improvement: 0.50 items; estimated
difference = 6.10, CI (1.28, 10.92), t-test: p = 0.041, Non
parametric Wilcoxon = 0.075].
Comprehensive Speech-Language Battery
A paired t-test revealed significant improvement in the WAB-
R AQ from baseline to post-test [mean: 2.51 points, CI (0.41,
4.61), t-test p = 0.025, Non parametric Wilcoxon = 0.055,
see Figure 1C]. This indicates that the participants improved
overall in their average WAB-R performance at post-test. One
participant demonstrated a clinically significant improvement of
at least 5 points (sham condition) and two other participants
achieved improvements of 4.6 and 4.9 points (one active and
one sham). No significant group differences were seen between
participants receiving active (N = 4) and sham tDCS [N = 5;
mean difference: −3.08, CI (−7.90, 1.74), t-test p = 0.15; Non
parametric Wilcoxon p = 0.19].
DISCUSSION
In our data, chronic stroke participants with speech and/or
language impairment exhibited detectable improvement on
speech-language measures following intensive robotic arm
rehabilitation preceded by tDCS. Critically, this improvement
was observed in the absence of speech-language therapy,
suggesting the possibility of synergistic effects across these
distinct domains of stroke recovery. It is worth noting that
Meinzer et al. (8) reported that tDCS stimulation with this
same montage may provide benefits to language processing
in older neurotypical adults, suggesting the possibility that
gains in language ability could come from the stimulation.
However, in our limited data set, there was no effect of
tDCS condition in most tasks. While we must be cautious
about drawing strong conclusions from this dataset, it is
possible that this reflects the fact that there was no explicit
speech/language activity paired with the stimulation and that
any benefit tDCS may provide in stroke rehabilitation comes
from pairing of treatment and stimulation. We also note
that recent findings on whether tDCS can affect language
processing have been mixed, with recent positive findings
reported for tDCS as an adjunct to aphasia therapy (9)
and stuttering therapy (10) but null findings also widely
reported (11).
In addition, we note that participants receiving sham showed
a greater improvement on category naming than those receiving
active stimulation, with the difference reaching significance in
a t-test (but not a non-parametric test). This result leaves open
the possibility that active tDCS was actively detrimental to
improvement on this task, although it is surprising that this
finding would occur for only one measure. We also note that
tDCS groups were not matched for speech-language ability as
part of the RCT and they were not matched in the study.
The small sample size here also precludes us from determining
whether other demographic or neurological factors (such as
those outlined in Table 1) can account for this difference, as any
regression analysis that would address this would be problematic
due to the number of participants.
The positive overall findings should be treated cautiously in
the absence of a control group not receiving robotics. In addition,
the finding of an improvement on the WAB was only significant
for a t-test and not non-parametric tests, and the 95% confidence
intervals for that comparison fall below the 5 point threshold
used to identify clinically significant improvement on that test.
Nevertheless, these findings, in addition to those in Hesse et al.
(1) on the subacute population, warrant additional systematic
explorations of the benefit of multi-domain therapies for stroke
rehabilitation.
