Abstract
Purpose—We assessed the relationship of self-reported racial discrimination with illicit drug use 
among US Blacks, and whether this differed by socioeconomic position (SEP).
Methods—Among 6587 Black participants in Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on 
Alcohol and Related Conditions (2004–2005), we used multiple logistic regression models to test 
the association between racial discrimination (measured on the 6-item Experiences of 
Discrimination scale) and past-year illicit drug use, and whether this differed by SEP.
Results—Racial discrimination was associated with past-year drug use [adjusted odds ratio 
(aOR) 2.32; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.70, 3.16] and with frequent drug use (aOR 1.91; 95 % 
CI 1.22, 2.99). For frequent illicit drug use, this relationship was stronger among higher SEP 
participants (aOR 3.55; 95 % CI 2.09, 6.02; pinteraction<0.001
Conclusions—The stronger association between racial discrimination and frequent illicit drug 
use among higher SEP Blacks suggests a complex interplay between disadvantaged and privileged 
statuses that merits further investigation. The finding of a significant difference by SEP highlights 
the importance of considering differences within heterogeneous race/ethnic groups when 
investigating health disparities.

 Introduction
As conceptualized by the stress and coping theory, substance use can be a form of avoidant 
coping with stressful life events [1–3]. As such, illicit drugs may be used to relieve anxiety, 
depression, or alienation; to avoid actively dealing with stressful life events; or to escape 
from current or remembered stress and trauma [1, 4]. Substance use as a coping strategy is 
associated with addiction and abuse [5-11], thus representing a substantial public health 
burden at the individual and population level through morbidity, mortality, and economic 
costs [12-15]. Racial discrimination has been conceptualized as both an acute and a chronic 
stressor that adversely affects physical and mental health [16-22]. As a source of stress, 
discrimination may, therefore, increase the risk for substance use and misuse, as has been 
demonstrated in prior studies [3, 4, 19, 23-35].
In investigating the impact of racism and discrimination on health, the concept of 
intersectionality has been used to understand the production of inequalities [36-39]. 
Intersectionality is a framework for understanding how multiple social identities interact to 
influence health conditions among members of multiply-disadvantaged groups as defined by 
race, class, gender, sexual orientation, disability, etc. [40–42]. However, in research on the 
relationship of racial discrimination and health, findings have been mixed about the effect of 
socioeconomic position (SEP) on this association. Some studies have suggested that 
occupying two or more disadvantaged positions within a society creates a “double burden” 
of risk—for example, low-SEP Blacks have worse health outcomes associated with 
discrimination than their high-SEP counterparts [18, 29, 43]. In contrast, other research has 
found that compared to low-SEP Blacks, high-SEP Blacks report more experiences of racial 
discrimination [36, 44], and may also have worse health outcomes associated with 
discrimination [45–47].
Substance use is among the health conditions most consistently associated with 
discrimination in published research [48]. However, no prior research has explored the 
relationship between racial discrimination and substance use by socioeconomic level in a 
representative US sample. We, therefore, investigated whether self-reported racial 
discrimination was associated with illicit drug use and whether this association differed by 
SEP, using data from the Black participants in the second wave of the National 
Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) study [49]. We focus 
only on Black participants in the current study because of the unique history of this group in 
the United States, especially in the context of institutionalized discrimination and 
socioeconomic disadvantage.
Methods
Study design and sample
Data were derived from the 2004–2005 NESARC (Wave 2), a nationally representative face-
to-face survey of 34,653 non-institutionalized US adults. Details on methodology, sampling, 
and weighting procedures for the NESARC are described elsewhere [49]. Briefly, the target 
population was individuals who were originally over the age of 18, residing in households 
and group quarters. Blacks, Hispanics, and young adults (aged 18–24) were oversampled,

 and the survey response rate was 81 %. The data were weighted to reflect design 
characteristics and then adjusted to be representative of the civilian population of the US. 
Informed consent was obtained for participation and study procedures were approved by the 
US Office of Management and Budget. For these analyses, we included only the Non-
Hispanic Black subset of NESARC respondents (N = 6587).
Measures
All variables were assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities 
Interview Schedule-DSM-IV version (AUDADIS-IV) [50]. This fully structured instrument 
was designed for experienced lay interviewers. Psychometric properties of the AUDADIS-
IV measures were good to excellent in general population samples [50–52].
Discrimination experiences—Self-reported experiences of racial discrimination were 
assessed using the 6-item AUDADIS-IV discrimination scale, modeled after Krieger's 
Experiences of Discrimination (EOD) scale [53]. Participants were asked how often in the 
past year they experienced discrimination because of their race in six situations: (1) 
obtaining health care; (2) treatment in health care; (3) public settings, including on the street 
and in stores or restaurants; (4) encountering institutions, including obtaining a job or on the 
job, when getting admitted to a school or training program, when interacting with the courts 
or police, and when obtaining housing; (5) called a racist name; and (6) pushed, shoved or 
threatened. Response options included “never”, “almost never”, “sometimes”, “fairly often”, 
“very often” or “unknown”.
The test–retest intra-class reliability coefficient (ICC) for the AUDADIS-IV EOD scale for 
past-year racial discrimination was good in the NESARC sample (ICC = 0.68) [52]. Among 
Black participants in this sample, the internal consistency reliability for the EOD scale was 
excellent (α = 0.75). Polychoric correlations between items ranged from 0.42 to 0.86. These 
lower values suggest unique variance of discrimination settings, so individual items were 
explored in addition to total scale scores. Following previous studies [18, 19], item responses 
were re-coded to indicate whether participants reported experiencing each discriminatory 
event at least “sometimes”. These binary indicator variables were then combined into an 
overall binary variable, indicating whether participants reported experiencing any 
discrimination events. We also created a summary variable for the number of settings in 
which any discrimination was reported (possible range 0–6).
Illicit drug use—We defined illicit drug use as using any illegal drug in the past year. 
Illicit drugs included marijuana, cocaine, hallucinogens, amphetamines, inhalants, heroin, 
and use of prescription drugs without a prescription or other than as prescribed. Prescription 
drugs used non-medically included opioids, amphetamines, sedatives, and tranquilizers. We 
examined two binary illicit drug use variables, any use and frequent use. Frequent use was 
defined as use at least once a week, on average, over the past year. Test–retest reliability of 
AUDADIS-IV measures for past-year drug use ranges from fair to excellent (κ = 0.50–0.86) 
[50, 54].

 Socioeconomic position—In accordance with 2004 US poverty guidelines [55], we 
coded respondents living at or below 150 % of the poverty line as living in poverty [56]. 
This variable was created using the AUDADIS annual household income level, a variable 
with 21 possible response levels [50], ranging from less than $5000 to $200,000 or more. 
For each possible response level, the numeric midpoint was assigned (e.g., $55,000 as the 
midpoint for the response level $50,000–$59,999) [57, 58]. Consistent with other research, 
we then dichotomized the variable according to the household income relative to the number 
of persons in the household [56]. Sensitivity analyses compared other measures of SEP. 
Annual personal income was assessed in four levels (<$19,000; $20,000–$34,999; $35,000–
$69,999; [$70,000). Education was assessed in three levels (<high school, high school or 
GED, [high school).
Control variables—Covariates included age, sex, education, US region, and urbanicity. 
US region and urbanicity variables used US census definitions based on respondents' current 
residence.
Statistical analysis
Preliminary analyses were conducted to provide descriptive characteristics of the analytical 
sample as a whole, and stratified by SEP. We estimated associations between self-reported 
discrimination and drug use using logistic regression models, controlling for sex, age, 
education, household income, US region, and urbanicity. To examine effect measure 
modification, we tested a multiplicative interaction term between discrimination and SEP on 
drug use outcomes. Sensitivity analyses included using alternative definitions of SEP, 
alternative definitions of racial discrimination in multiple settings, and separate analyses for 
marijuana versus other illicit drug use. All analyses accounted for the complex sampling 
features of the NESARC survey using SUDAAN version 11.0.1 (Research Triangle 
Institute).
Results
As shown in Table 1, 36.0 % (SE = 1.2) of the sample was defined as low SEP, i.e., at or 
below 150 % of the US poverty line. About one quarter (24.6 %) reported experiencing 
racial discrimination in the past year (Table 1). Respondents reported racial discrimination 
most commonly in public settings (18.3 %), and least commonly as being pushed, shoved, or 
threatened (2.0 %). Regarding number of settings, 13.2 % reported discrimination in one 
setting, 6.9 % in two settings, and 4.5 % in three or more settings. Any past-year illicit drug 
use was reported by 6.5 %, while 2.9 % reported use on at least a weekly basis.
Discrimination and substance use
Past-year discrimination was associated with higher odds for illicit drug use [adjusted odds 
ratio (aOR) 2.32, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.70, 3.16] and frequent illicit drug use 
(aOR 1.91, 95 % CI 1.22, 2.99) in the past year (Table 2). Respondents who reported 
discrimination in public settings; in encountering institutions; from being called a racist 
name; and from being pushed, shoved, or threatened were all at higher odds of past-year 
illicit drug use (aORs 1.79–2.90) than those not reporting discrimination. Only

 discrimination in encountering institutions was associated with higher odds for frequent 
illicit drug use (aOR 2.14, 95 % CI 1.19, 3.83). In addition, a dose–response relationship 
was observed between the number of discrimination settings and past-year illicit drug use, 
although not for frequent use.
Effect modification by socioeconomic position
The interaction between SEP and discrimination was not significant for any illicit drug use 
(β = −0.38, 95 % CI = −1.01, 0.25, p = 0.23) (Table 3). However, a significant interaction 
between SEP and discrimination was found for frequent drug use (β = −1.34, 95 % CI = 
−2.20, 22120.47, p = 0.003). Stratified analyses indicated that among low-SEP participants, 
discrimination was not associated with frequent drug use (aOR 0.85; 95 % CI 0.41, 1.77). 
However, among higher SEP participants, a significant association was found between 
discrimination and frequent drug use (aOR 3.55; 95 % CI 2.09, 6.02).
Sensitivity analyses
To determine whether these results were driven by the more highly prevalent use of 
marijuana compared to other illicit drugs, we estimated the effect measure for discrimination 
separately for marijuana and for all other illicit drugs used. The magnitude of the effect size 
for any past-year marijuana use (aOR 2.20; 95 % CI 1.55, 3.11) was similar to that of other 
illicit drug use (aOR 2.45; 95 % CI 1.29, 4.67). For frequent drug use, the effect size for 
other drug use (aOR 4.21; 95 % CI 1.92, 8.87) was notably higher than for frequent 
marijuana use (aOR 1.66; 95 % CI 1.01, 2.73), perhaps indicating that racial discrimination 
has a stronger effect on the frequent use of other drugs than on marijuana use. However, 
sample sizes for frequent illicit drug use other than marijuana were small, limiting further 
substance-specific investigation of these differences.
To test the robustness of our binary indicator of poverty level as a measure of SEP, we 
conducted sensitivity analyses of the interactions and in our stratified models using other 
possible measures of SEP (Table 3). Regardless of the measure used to operationalize SEP, 
the associations between discrimination, illicit drug use, and frequent drug use were all in 
the same direction and magnitude as the main findings, although not all were significant. 
Using the 4-level income variable (which yielded fewer participants in each cell), the 
interactions between discrimination and SEP were not statistically significant (F = 0.12, df = 
3, p = 0.95 for any illicit drug use; and F = 1.34, df = 3, p = 0.27 for frequent illicit drug 
use). However, stratified analyses indicated that effect sizes were similar to those obtained 
using poverty level as a measure of SEP, although confidence intervals were wide.
Consistent with our main analyses, the interaction of the 3-level education variable by 
discrimination was statistically significant for frequent drug use (F = 3.15, df = 2, p = 
0.0496), but not any illicit drug use (F = 2.18, df = 2, p = 0.12). Analyses stratified by 
education level produced similar estimates to those using the poverty SEP measure, with no 
statistical association between discrimination and drug use for participants with less than a 
high school education; higher odds for both any past-year drug use (aOR 3.55; 95 % CI 
2.01, 6.27) and frequent drug use (aOR 2.88; 95 % CI 1.19, 7.01) for participants with more

 than a high school education; and evidence of a dose–response relationship across the three 
levels (Table 3).
Finally, we assessed additive exposure to racial discrimination in two ways. First, as 
presented in Table 2, we summed the self-report of “any discrimination” from all the six 
separate exposure domains (range 0–6). Second, we summed the original Likert scores from 
each domain measure of discrimination to capture frequency as well as setting (range 6–30). 
Both methods produced similar results, including the apparent dose–response relationship 
between experiencing more discrimination and illicit drug use.
Discussion
In Black participants in a US nationally representative sample, self-reported experiences of 
past-year racial discrimination were associated with higher odds for any illicit drug use and 
frequent illicit drug use. Racial discrimination experienced in varied settings was associated 
with higher odds for any illicit drug use, while only discrimination in encountering 
institutions was significantly associated with higher odds for frequent use. We also observed 
evidence for a dose–response relationship between number of domains in which 
discrimination was reported and past-year illicit drug use. The relationship between 
discrimination and frequent drug use differed significantly by SEP in an interaction analysis, 
and stratified analyses by SEP indicated that the association of racial discrimination and 
frequent drug use was only found among participants with higher SEP. Results were robust 
in sensitivity analyses using educational level to measure SEP, and consistent in direction 
and magnitude with personal income level as the SEP indicator.
Few studies have examined the differential health effects associated with exposure to 
discrimination in various settings, even though such documentation may be legally 
actionable or relevant to reducing discrimination from a policy perspective [38, 59]. We 
found that the largest odds for past-year illicit drug use were associated with discrimination 
in public settings; encountering institutions; and from being pushed, shoved, or threatened. 
Because the encountering institutions indicator includes discrimination in obtaining a job, on 
the job, when obtaining housing, and from the criminal justice system, this variable may 
most closely capture structural discrimination experiences. Given the lack of research on the 
health effects of structural discrimination relative to interpersonal exposure, the three times 
higher odds of drug use that we found may be a telling finding about the effect on health 
from multiple levels of exposure [38]. In contrast, self-reported discrimination in the 
healthcare setting was not associated with either of the substance use outcomes assessed. 
This may be due to the protective effects of being in healthcare on health outcomes, over and 
above the harmful effects of discrimination, or to the possibility that discrimination in the 
healthcare system in the absence of severe illness may not be attributed as such [60].
The lack of significant association between racial discrimination and frequent drug use for 
low-SEP Blacks in conjunction with the strong, significant relationships among higher SEP 
Blacks supports the theory of relative deprivation, defined as “the individual frustration 
produced by a negative comparison with a reference group” (p. 781) [61]. For higher SEP 
Blacks, the opportunity for comparison may be more common due to interaction with White 
Carliner et al.

 neighbors and colleagues, which may intensify this frustration [45]. Furthermore, racial 
discrimination may constrain higher SEP Blacks from accessing the privilege of their SEP 
(e.g., better neighborhoods). Compared to low-SEP Blacks, higher SEP Blacks' awareness of 
this inequity may exacerbate the insult of racial discrimination, resulting in greater 
psychosocial stress and increased risk for drug use as a coping behavior [36].
Alternatively, low-SEP Blacks, compared to higher SEP Blacks, may experience more 
adverse forms of life stress related to their environment and economic status, so that 
discrimination becomes a less important driver of health behaviors or health status. In 
addition, because low-SEP Blacks are more likely to live and work in highly segregated 
areas than higher SEP Blacks [45], racial segregation could also limit opportunities for 
exposure to discrimination among low-SEP individuals [62, 63], as suggested by the lower 
prevalence of discrimination reported in public settings, shown in Table 1, compared to 
higher SEP individuals. Finally, individuals with fewer socioeconomic resources may be 
more likely to under-report discrimination [64–66], which would bias results towards the 
null in this group. Future research should continue to explore possible reasons for 
differential health outcomes related to multiple group membership.
Limitations
Approaches to the measurement of discrimination in its multiple forms are debated [38, 66, 
67], and the EOD scale may not capture less explicit forms of institutionalized or 
internalized discrimination in negative health effects. Our measure of past-year 
discrimination does not account for discrimination experienced at younger ages and how this 
may affect current behavior, attitudes, and health. In addition, as noted by the scale 
developers, to report racial discrimination, respondents must be aware that their experiences 
are different than other peoples' and that this differential treatment is attributable to racism 
[37, 38, 59, 66]. This suggests that self-report measures of discrimination underestimate the 
effects of discrimination on health among those without such awareness [68]. Self-reported 
discrimination may also be influenced by period and cohort effects, which could impact 
perceptions of discrimination and, therefore, the reporting of discrimination during different 
time periods and in different age cohorts. These results may, therefore, not be generalizable 
to other time periods. The cross-sectional nature of this study limits causal inference about 
these effects. Furthermore, observational studies are always subject to unmeasured 
confounding, which in the current study, could be a factor predisposing individuals both to 
use drugs and to experience or report racial discrimination. However, prior longitudinal 
studies showing that self-reported discrimination precedes substance use support the causal 
direction proposed herein [24–26]. Finally, as the NESARC sample only includes non-
institutionalized adults, results may not be generalizable to other populations.
Conclusions
Consistent with prior research, this study indicates that self-reported racial discrimination 
may have deleterious effects on health, specifically past-year drug use, among US Blacks. 
Paradoxically, the effect of discrimination may be stronger for higher SEP Blacks, 
supporting emerging theories concerning the complex intersection between disadvantaged

 and privileged statuses [36, 66]. The significant difference among Blacks by SEP highlights 
the importance of considering differences within heterogeneous racial and ethnic groups 
when investigating health disparities. Future research should expand on this investigation of 
intersectionalities in the experience of discrimination by also jointly assessing the effects of 
multiple forms of discrimination, including discrimination based on race, ethnicity, SEP, 
gender, sexual orientation, and disability in different disadvantaged populations. Research 
should also continue to explore the differential effects of different domains of racial 
discrimination—from the level of racial microaggressions [69] to persistent forms of 
structural discrimination—to locate the arenas in which racism is still most persistent, most 
harmful, and most deeply felt; so that policy and education can best be targeted. Research 
and interventions for substance misuse should consider the contribution of discrimination to 
drug use as a coping response. Public awareness campaigns and policy recommendations 
should emphasize the overlap and the distinction between race and SEP, and should consider 
the possibility of complex interactions due to intersecting social identities.
