Purpose
We determined the utility of the 21-Gene Recurrence Score (RS) in predicting late (. 5 years) distant
recurrence (LDR) in stage I and II breast cancer within high and low-ESR1–expressing groups.
Patients and Methods
RS was assessed in chemotherapy/tamoxifen-treated, estrogen receptor (ER) –positive, node-
positive National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-28 patients and tamoxifen-treated,
ER-positive, node-negative B-14 patients. The association of the RS with risk of distant recurrence
(DR) 0 to 5 years and those at risk . 5 years was assessed. An ESR1 expression cut point was
optimized in B-28 and tested in B-14.
Results
Median follow-up was 11.2 years for B-28 and 13.9 years for B-14. Of 1,065 B-28 patients, 36% had
low (, 18), 34% intermediate (18 to 30), and 30% high ($ 31) RS. Of 668 B-14 patients, 51% had
low, 22% intermediate, and 27% high RS. Median ESR1 expression by reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction was: B-28, 9.7 normalized expression cycle threshold units (CT) and
B-14, 10.7 CT. In B-28, RS was associated with DR 0 to 5 years (log-rank P , .001) and . 5 to 10 years
(log-rank P = .02) regardless of ESR1 expression. An ESR1 expression cut point of 9.1 CT was
identified in B-28. It was validated in B-14 patients for whom the RS was associated with DR in years
5 to 15: 6.8% (95% CI, 4.4% to 10.6%) versus 11.2% (95% CI, 6.2% to 19.9%) versus 16.4% (95%
CI, 10.2% to 25.7%) for RS , 18, RS 18 to 30, and RS $ 31, respectively (log-rank P = .01).
Conclusion
For LDR, RS is strongly prognostic in patients with higher quantitative ESR1. Risk of LDR is relatively
low for patients with low RS. These results suggest the value of extended tamoxifen therapy merits
evaluation in patients with intermediate and high RS with higher ESR1 expression at initial diagnosis.

INTRODUCTION
Estrogen receptor (ER) –positive breast cancer
shows a protracted risk of recurrence, with ap-
proximately 50% of recurrences occurring after
5 years (late distant recurrence, LDR) in contrast to
ER-negative breast cancer, which recurs primarily
within the first 5 years.1-4 ER-positive breast
cancers at the greatest risk of LDR have been shown
to have both high ER and high proliferation gene
expression.5 In ER-positive breast cancer, after
5 years of endocrine therapy, this time-dependent
association between higher ER/ER-related gene
expression, higher proliferation gene expres-
sion, and LDR was recently confirmed using
quantitative assessments of ER and proliferation
gene expression.6
This association is clinically relevant. Five
years of adjuvant tamoxifen substantially reduces
recurrence rates for at least 15 years after di-
agnosis.1 National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and

 Bowel Project (NSABP) B-14 evaluated 5 versus 10 years of ta-
moxifen and suggested that . 5 years of tamoxifen was not
warranted, as patients treated with an additional 5 years of ta-
moxifen fared worse than those who received placebo.7 In
contrast, the ATLAS (Adjuvant Tamoxifen Longer Against
Shorter) and aTTom (Adjuvant Tamoxifen—To Offer More?)
trials showed that 10 years of tamoxifen significantly reduces risk
of recurrence and breast cancer mortality compared with 5 years
of treatment.8,9 NCIC Clinical Trials Group MA17 also dem-
onstrated that extended endocrine therapy with letrozole im-
proves outcomes in postmenopausal patients with hormone
receptor–positive breast cancer after 5 years of tamoxifen.10
ASCO guidelines now recommend an extended 5 years of ta-
moxifen.11 Although studies have shown that select clinico-
pathologic factors are associated with higher risk of LDR
(eg, lymph node–positive disease or larger-sized tumors), there
remains an unmet clinical need to more accurately identify
ER-positive patients at greater risk of LDR given the adverse effects
of extended hormone therapy.12,13 Molecular assays may help
identify patients who will benefit from prolonged hormonal
therapy.6,14-16 For hormone receptor–positive, early-stage breast
cancer, the 21-Gene Recurrence Score assay (RS) is a widely used
predictor of 10-year risk of DR17-22 and of the likely benefit of
adjuvant chemotherapy.18,19 Individually reported quantitative
estrogen receptor mRNA level (ESR1) is also a strong continuous
predictor of tamoxifen benefit.23,24 The findings of Dowsett et al6
suggest that results of the RS assay may be useful in the prediction
of LDR. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine if the RS
can identify a group of patients with breast cancer who are at low
risk for LDR and to determine if this relationship is dependent on
levels of quantitative ESR1 expression.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Studies and Patients
Included were patients with RS information from NSABP B-14
(tamoxifen-only arm) and B-2817,22 (Fig 1). B-14 compared placebo or
tamoxifen (N = 2,892). The RS study included 668 ER-positive, tamoxifen-
treated patients.7,25,26 Median follow-up was 13.9 years. B-28 compared
doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC; 4 cycles) with four cycles of AC
followed by four cycles of paclitaxel (N = 3,060) with 5 years of tamoxifen
for hormone receptor–positive patients.27 The RS study included 1,065
ER-positive, tamoxifen-treated patients. Median follow-up was 11.2 years.
RS and quantitative ESR1 methodology were previously described.17,28
Participating institutions obtained approval from their human in-
vestigations committee or institutional review board and filed assurances
with the Department of Health and Human Services. Written informed
consent was required for enrollment.

 Statistical Analysis and Study End Points
The primary end point was distant recurrence-free interval, defined
as time from study entry to first distant recurrence (DR), with contralateral
breast cancer or non–breast second primary cancers ignored (B-28) or
treated as censoring events (B-14), and death or loss to follow-up treated
as a censoring event. Patients were grouped into low-RS (, 18),
intermediate-RS (18 to 30), and high-RS ($ 31) groups. The association
between RS and DR by time period (0 to 5 years, . 5 years) was de-
termined for all patients in B-28 and B-14 using Kaplan-Meier estimates
and log-rank tests for the RS risk groups and Cox proportional hazards
models for the continuous RS.
The development stage used B-28 to establish the ESR1 mRNA
expression cut point at a natural quantile of the distribution on the basis of
the hazard ratio (HR) for the RS association with LDR risk (. 5 years) in
high-ESR1–expressing patients, on the basis of Cox models with time-
dependent effects. Subsequently, the cut point was independently tested in
B-14. Analyses were conducted to determine the robustness of the results
to the specific cut point given patient characteristic differences between the
two studies. Kaplan-Meier estimates and log-rank tests were used to
evaluate outcomes in the RS groups by time period (0 to 5 years, . 5 years)
and ESR1 expression level (lower or higher ESR1 expression on the basis of
the B-28 optimized cut point).
Log-rank statistics for 0 to 5 years are based on all data up to 5 years
with administrative censoring at 5 years. Log-rank statistics after 5 years are
based on all patients who were DR-free at 5 years and followed for re-
currence after 5 years. Cox models assessed the association strength be-
tween the continuous RS and DR risk by time period and ESR1 level.
Model diagnostics were performed, and alternative functional forms were
considered for the association of the RS with LDR risk in high-ESR1
expressors, including natural spline models (two degrees of freedom) and
quadratic models on log-hazard scale. Multivariable Cox proportional
hazards models examined whether RS provides independent prognostic
information for LDR in higher-ESR1–expressing patients. Cox model HRs
for the RS are estimated for a 50-point difference, CIs use the Wald
method, and P values are based on likelihood ratio tests. Statistical sig-
nificance used a P value # .05. NSABP and Genomic Health Inc conducted
analyses jointly.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
There were 1,065 ER-positive patients in NSABP B-28 and 668
tamoxifen-treated ER-positive patients in B-14 with sufficient
tissue for RNA extraction and the RS assay. Patient characteristics
were described previously.17,22 Clinicopathologic characteristics
are summarized in Appendix Table A1 (online only).
Of B-28 patients, 36% had low (, 18), 34% intermediate
(18 to 30), and 30% high ($ 31) RS results. Of B-14 patients, 51%
had low, 22% intermediate, and 27% high RS results. The mean
(standard deviation) reference normalized expression cycle thresh-
old (CT) levels for ESR1 were 9.6 (1.2) in B-28 and 10.5 (1.7) in
B-14. The association between the continuous RS and ESR1 in each
study is shown in Appendix Figure A1 (online only). Although
there was a shift toward higher ESR1 in B-14 compared with B-28,
the association between the RS and ESR1 level was similar in both
studies.
Late Recurrence Events
In B-28, of 359 DR events, 168 (47%) occurred after 5 years. In
B-14, of 109 DR events, 50 (46%) occurred after 5 years. Previ-
ous studies demonstrated the association between the RS and
cumulative risk of recurrence over 10 years for both studies.17,22
When divided by early DR or LDR, in B-28, the RS risk groups were
prognostic for both early (0 to 5 years, log-rank P ,.001) and late
(. 5 years, log-rank P = .02) DR risk (Figs 2A and 2B). In B-14, RS
risk groups were prognostic for early DR risk (LDR not statistically
significant [log-rank P = .06; Figs 2C and 2D]).
ESR1 Cut Point Selection in B-28
B-28 was used to establish a quantitative ESR1 expression cut
point identifying a subgroup for which the RS predicted LDR. A
range of cut points were evaluated based on the HR for the as-
sociation of the continuous RS with LDR (Appendix Fig A2, online
only). The first tertile (9.1 CTunits) was selected as the cut point to
test for strength and precision of the HR estimate and to determine
the size of the higher-ESR1–expressing patient population. HR
estimates were robust to cut point choice, and the lower limit of the
CI for the RS HR was above 1.0 for cut point values near 9.1. The
association strength and CI width increased gradually with in-
creasing values of the cut point above 9.1. For all subsequent
results, higher ESR1 expression is defined as expression . 9.1 CT
cut point.
Within the B-28 cohort, RS was associated with DR risk up to
5 years in lower and higher ESR1 expression (Fig 3; Table 1;
Appendix Fig A3, online only). After 5 years, the RS was associated
with DR only in the higher-ESR1–expressing patients (log-rank
P = .001 for RS risk groups) but not in the lower-ESR1–expressing
patients (log-rank P = .87). In years 5 to 10, for higher-ESR1–
expressing patients, the DR risks were 10.5% (95% CI, 7.3% to
14.8%) in low-RS, 22.5% (17.0% to 29.5%) in intermediate-RS,
and 22.6% (15.6% to 32.0%) in the high-RS group.
Cox models for DR were fit with terms for the continuous RS,
time period, ESR1-expression group, and the two- and three-way
interactions among them. Interaction tests were conducted as
secondary analyses on the basis of these models and were not the
basis for cut point selection. The association between RS and LDR
risk differed between lower- and higher-ESR1–expression groups,
with a statistically significant two-way interaction between the
RS and ESR1-expression group after 5 years (P = .04). The cor-
responding interaction term was not significant for early events
(0 to 5 years, P = .19). In an analysis restricted to late events, the
interaction term among ESR1(. 9.1 v , 9.1) and RS, indicating
effect modification on the basis of an ESR1 threshold at 9.1 after
5 years, remained statistically significant after adjusting for clinical
and pathologic characteristics (P = .02).
ESR1 Expression Cut Point Testing in B-14
The 9.1 CT cut point for ESR1 expression was subsequently
tested independently in the B-14 data set. Because the distribution
of ESR1 in B-14 was higher than B-28, the 9.1 CT cut point was the
14th percentile in B-14, such that 86% of patients were in the
higher ESR1 group.
Among the higher-ESR1–expressing patients, the RS was
a significant predictor of DR after 5 years (log-rank P = .01),
confirming the B-28 results (Fig 4; Table 1). In years 5 to 10, for
higher-ESR1–expressing patients, DR risks were 4.7% (2.8% to
8.0%) in the low, 4.1% (1.6% to 10.6%) in the intermediate, and
12.6% (7.4% to 21.2%) in the high-RS group. In years 5 to 15, for

Recurrence Score and ESR1 Expression
 higher-ESR1–expressing patients, the DR risks were 6.8% (4.4% to
10.6%) in the low, 11.2% (6.2% to 19.9%) in the intermediate, and
16.4% (10.2% to 25.7%) in the high-RS group (Appendix Figs A4
and A5, online only).
Similar to B-28 results, RS was associated with DR risk before
5 years regardless of ESR1 expression level in B-14 (Table 1;
Appendix Fig A4, online only). In B-14 there were few events after
5 years among the lower-ESR1–expressing patients, with most
events occurring before 5 years in the high-RS patients with lower
ESR1.
Cox model interaction tests were conducted as secondary
analyses. The association between RS and LDR risk differed be-
tween lower- and higher-ESR1 groups for late events (two-way
interaction, P = .03). There was no statistical evidence of a two-way
interaction for early events (0 to 5 years, P = .35). The significant
interaction for late events persisted after adjustment for covariates
(P = .01).
After successfully testing the a priori–determined 9.1 cut
point, sensitivity analyses determined the robustness of the results
to the specific ESR1 cut point value. The RS HR was nearly constant
for cut points between 8.7 and 9.7 (2.17 and 2.23), and the lower
limit of the 95% CI excluded 1.0 for cut points 8.2 to 10.7.
Successful testing of the established cut point was not overly
sensitive to the specific value used. The HRs and CI widths in-
creased gradually with increasing cut point values above 9.7, as the
higher ESR1 sample size decreased.
Subgroup Analyses
In B-28 and B-14, the RS risk groups’ association with LDR
risk for higher-ESR1–expressing patients was explored within
subgroups according to clinicopathologic characteristics. This
association was consistent with the overall results (Fig 5). In B-28,
one to three positive nodes had a lower LDR risk compared with
four or more positive nodes (Appendix Table A2, online only). In
patients with a low RS, the risk of DR between 5 and 10 years was
7.9% (4.8% to 12.8%) in patients with one to three positive nodes,
compared with 16.7% (10.0% to 27.0%) in patients with four or
more positive nodes. For ERBB2-negative or equivocal patients,
including n = 937 (88.0%) in B-28 and n = 594 (88.9%) in B-14,
the association of the RS with LDR risk in higher-ESR1–expressing
patients was similar to the overall results (data not shown).

LDR risk in high-ESR1–expressing patients were explored in B-14

 and B-28. In B-28, the linear model provided a good fit. In B-14,
a better fit was provided by a quadratic model (P , .001 for as-
sociation of the RS with DR risk; P , .001 for the test of whether
the additional quadratic term provided a better fit than a linear
term alone).23 Appendix Figure A6 (online only) shows the esti-
mated association between the RS and LDR risk in high-ESR1–
expressing patients.
Multivariable Models
In B-28, only nodes (P #.001) and continuous RS (P = .004)
were significant predictors of LDR in higher-ESR1–expressing
patients in a multivariable model adjusting for nodes, size, age,
grade, surgery type, and treatment (Appendix Table A2, online
only). In B-14, only central grade (P = .003) and continuous RS
(P = .005; quadratic model, which provided a significantly better
fit) were significant predictors of LDR in higher-ESR1–expressing
patients in a multivariable model after adjustment for age, size, and
grade (Appendix Table A3, online only).23
In B-14, patients completing 5 years of tamoxifen were
randomly assigned to an additional 5 years of treatment, although
the extended tamoxifen was stopped early (median of 2.5 years;
range, 1.6 to 5.0 years). To determine if extended tamoxifen
treatment affected results for high-ESR1–expressing patients, the
association of the RS with LDR in the high-ESR1–expressing
patients who were re-randomly assigned to extended tamoxifen or

 placebo was assessed. For the 144 high-ESR1–expressing patients at
risk after 5 years who were among those assigned to extended
tamoxifen, the DR risk estimates over 5 to 15 years for the low-,
intermediate-, and high-RS groups were 6.9% (3.1% to 14.7%),
5.0% (0.7% to 30.5%), and 17.5% (7.7% to 37.2%).
DISCUSSION
Using the RS assay, we tested patient tumor tissue from NSABP
B-28 and found that the RS and quantitative ESR1 cutoff of 9.1 CT
were able to quantify the likelihood of LDR in patients with
node-positive, ER-positive breast cancer treated with 5 years of
chemotherapy plus tamoxifen. We subsequently independently
tested and confirmed the quantitative ESR1 expression cut point
of 9.1 CT and RS as an independent predictor of LDR in patients
with node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer treated with ta-
moxifen in B-14. Because the distribution of ESR1 expression in
B-14 was generally higher than that of B-28, the majority of B-14
patients were in the higher-ESR1–expression subset. In the lower-
ESR1–expression group the RS was a significant predictor of early
DR but was not a significant predictor of LDR; however, few
events were experienced after 5 years among the lower-ESR1–
expressing patients, for whom most events occurred before
5 years in the overly represented high-RS patients, consistent with
ER-poor biology.5
These data have implications with respect to cancer patho-
genesis and metastasis. Our data confirm and extend results of the
foundational gene expression studies, starting with Bianchini et al,5
who used gene expression arrays to show that highly proliferative,
high-ER gene–expressing tumors are at the greatest risk of late
relapse. Dowsett et al6 further confirmed this association using the
ER and proliferation gene expression modules in ER-positive,
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative tumors
from the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or Combined (ATAC)
randomized clinical trial. In the current study, we have identified
a statistically significant interaction between quantitative ESR1
expression, the RS (which includes the five-gene proliferation
group), and the risk of LDR in B-28 (interaction P = .04) and B-14
(P = .03). Similar results were seen for the ER and proliferation
modules alone (data not shown). In the ESR1-poor group, pre-
dominantly populated by high-RS patients, the RS was strongly

 associated with the risk of early DR, suggesting that early relapses
are most common in tumors intrinsically resistant to endocrine
treatment.23 Alternatively, ESR1-rich tumors are at risk for both
early DR and LDR, and the RS risk groups provided further risk
stratification. Although underpowered in B-28 and B-14, the
results in the higher-ESR1–expressing patients are consistent
across subgroups.
Previous reports have suggested that the RS does not predict
LDR, whereas other multigene expression–based assays do.14-16

 numbers are relatively small, and reports of comparisons of the RS
with other tests show differences with overlapping CIs.16,29
How do these results and other studies of LDR risk affect the
extended endocrine therapy treatment decision? They confirm
studies of other molecular assays in postmenopausal patients and
extend these findings to premenopausal women: at-risk pa-
tients have varying rates of LDR, and a low-risk group with less
than a 5% risk of recurrence in the second quinquennium can be
identified.15,16,30-32 In addition to nodal status,27 there seems to be
additional discrimination of LDR risk by genomic assays that
combine measures of proliferation and ESR1 expression or ER gene
groups.5,14,15,30 Recent ASCO guidelines, on evidence derived from
five studies of tamoxifen treatment beyond 5 years, recommend
extended treatment of all hormone receptor–positive patients.11
Use of the RS, which includes the proliferation gene module and
quantitative ESR1 expression for risk of LDR assessment, may be
useful for patient risk stratification, and these results are already
available for thousands of patients for whom the RS was used on
initial diagnosis. Additional studies are needed to validate that
genomic factors can predict which patients should be treated with
only 5 years of hormonal therapy.
The strengths of this study include that these refined estimates
of LDR can be derived from RS and quantitative ESR1 gene ex-
pression results. The present data are from randomized, well-
controlled studies with sufficient numbers of LDR events for ef-
fective cut point selection and testing. Our analyses include an
independent training population and separate, independent test
population. There are also limitations. This report cannot directly
address the question of which subset of patients derive benefit
from . 5 years of hormonal treatment. Also, more contemporary
study outcomes have improved over time; for example, the total
rate of DR at 9 years in node-negative patients treated with ta-
moxifen or anastrozole with low-RS results (n = 872) was , 4% in
TransATAC (Translational Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in
Combination).20
The RS alone is a significant prognostic factor for cumulative
risk over 10 years, although this association is attenuated in later
years. For LDR, the RS is prognostic in the majority of ER-positive,
lymph node–negative patients with higher quantitative ESR1 ex-
pression, where the risk of LDR is relatively low for patients with
low-RS results, and these results confirm and extend the associ-
ation between high proliferation and ER levels with LDR.4,5,33
These RS and quantitative ESR1 results may help select patients
who could benefit most from hormonal therapy beyond 5 years
of treatment and merit further study in larger cohorts, such as
MA-17R and NSABP B-42.

‡HR estimated for RS 5 40 versus RS 5 10 based on the quadratic model, which includes linear and quadratic terms. The hypothesis test is for including both terms
versus neither term (two degrees of freedom). See Figure A6 for a graphical depiction of the association between the RS and distant recurrence risk after 5 to 15 years.
