IMPORTANCE Guidelines recommend assessing orthostatic hypotension (OH) 3 minutes after
rising from supine to standing positions. It is not known whether measurements performed
immediately after standing predict adverse events as strongly as measurements performed
closer to 3 minutes.
OBJECTIVE To compare early vs later OH measurements and their association with history of
dizziness and longitudinal adverse outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a prospective cohort study of middle-aged
(range, 44-66 years) participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study
(1987-1989).
EXPOSURES Orthostatic hypotension, defined as a drop in blood pressure (BP) (systolic BP
�20 mm Hg or diastolic BP �10 mm Hg) from the supine to standing position, was measured
up to 5 times at 25-second intervals.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We determined the association of each of the 5 OH
measurements with history of dizziness on standing (logistic regression) and risk of fall,
fracture, syncope, motor vehicle crashes, and all-cause mortality (Cox regression) over a
median of 23 years of follow-up (through December 31, 2013).
RESULTS In 11 429 participants (mean age, 54 years; 6220 [54%] were women; 2934 [26%]
were black) with at least 4 OH measurements after standing, after adjustment OH assessed at
measurement 1 (mean [SD], 28 [5.4] seconds; range, 21-62 seconds) was the only
measurement associated with higher odds of dizziness (odds ratio [OR], 1.49; 95% CI,
1.18-1.89). Measurement 1 was associated with the highest rates of fracture, syncope, and
death at 18.9, 17.0, and 31.4 per 1000 person-years. Measurement 2 was associated with the
highest rate of falls and motor vehicle crashes at 13.2 and 2.5 per 1000 person-years.
Furthermore, after adjustment measurement 1 was significantly associated with risk of fall
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; 95% CI, 1.03-1.44), fracture (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01-1.34), syncope
(HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.20-1.63), and mortality (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.23-1.51). Measurement 2
(mean [SD], 53 [7.5] seconds; range, 43-83 seconds) was associated with all long-term
outcomes, including motor vehicle crashes (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.04-1.96). Measurements
obtained after 1 minute were not associated with dizziness and were inconsistently
associated with individual long-term outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In contrast with prevailing recommendations, OH
measurements performed within 1 minute of standing were the most strongly related to
dizziness and individual adverse outcomes, suggesting that OH be assessed within 1 minute
of standing.

American Academy of Neurology,4 which has since been incor-
porated into international guidelines.5 This statement defines
OH by a postural reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of

Hg or greater, measured 3 minutes after rising from a supine to
standing position.4 However, the 3-minute time delay is often
less practical in clinical settings owing to time constraints. It is
unclearwhetherearlymeasurementsareasinformativeaslater
measurements. Indeed, a number of reports advocate discard-
ing the first blood pressure (BP) measurement owing to pre-
sumed changes in physiology, that is, BP “restabilization.
”6,7 In
the recent SPRINT study,8 investigators measured BP at 1 min-
ute after standing with seemingly paradoxical results, that is,
moreaggressiveantihypertensivetreatmentwasassociatedwith
a lower prevalence of OH but higher risk of its sequelae (emer-
gencydepartmentvisitsforOHandsyncope)withnoincreased
risk of fall. Whether these counterintuitive findings stem from
the shortened time interval is unknown.
To provide evidence for the optimal timing of OH assess-
ment, we compared repeated BP measurement obtained at dif-
ferenttimesinalarge,community-basedpopulationofmiddle-
aged adults. Using repeated BP measurements, our objectives
wereto(1)compareearlyandlaterOHmeasurementswithself-
reported history of dizziness on standing; and (2) compare the
associations between early and later OH measurements rela-
tive to long-term, incident clinical outcomes (eg, falls, frac-
tures, syncope, motor vehicle crashes, and mortality). We hy-
pothesized a priori that measurements obtained less than 1
minute after standing would be less informative than mea-
surements obtained 1 to 2 minutes after standing.
Methods
Study Population
The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study is a pro-
spectivecohortof15792adults.Participants,ages45to64years,
wereoriginallyenrolledbetween1987and1989from4UScom-
munities and followed for over 2 decades.9-11 Physical exami-
nations,medicalinterviews,andlaboratorytestswereconducted
as part of the original ARIC protocol. We excluded participants
whodidnothaveanOHassessmentatbaseline(n = 2555),who
were missing any of the first 4 orthostatic measurements (n =
1210), who were missing dizzy status (n = 15), and who were
missing relevant covariate data at baseline (n = 583). This re-
sulted in a study population of 11 429 participants. A compari-
son of baseline characteristics of participants included and
excludedfromthisstudymaybefoundineTable1intheSupple-
ment.ParticipanthealthstatusrelativetoclinicallyreportedOH
symptoms or outcomes was not known at ARIC study entry.
Written informed consent was obtained from all parti-
cipants, and the study protocol was approved by institu-
tional review boards at all study sites. Participants received
compensation.
Orthostatic Hypotension and History of Dizziness
During the baseline visit, supine SBP and DBP were measured
with a Dinamap 1846 SX oscillometric device (automatic cuff)
after participants had been lying for 20 minutes.12,13 An oscil-
lometric device rather than a manual device was used to stan-
dardize the timing of repeated measurements between par-
ticipants. The device was programmed to record up to 5 BP
measurementswhilelyinginthe2minutesprecedingthestand-
ingphaseoftheprotocol(range,2-5supinemeasurementswith
at ≥4 measurements obtained for 90% of participants). Prior to
standing, each participant was asked if he or she “usually gets
dizzy on standing up.
” A yes or no response was recorded, and
participants responding “yes” were permitted to pause in the
seated position at the edge of the examination table until they
felt safe to stand. Otherwise, all participants were instructed to
stand up quickly, safely, and in 1 smooth motion. If a partici-
pant felt dizzy immediately after standing, they were permit-
ted to lean back against the examination table; otherwise, they
were instructed to stand away from the table.
After giving the command to stand, the time that both of a
participant’
s feet were planted on the ground was recorded by
ARIC staff, who then proceeded to initiate the automatic cuff,
whichwasprogrammedtomeasureBPupto5times(range,2-5
standing measurements with at least 4 measurements re-
corded for 91% of participants). The end and initiation of each
BP measurement was separated by 2 or 3 seconds. The time of
eachmeasurementresultwasrecordedandvariedbasedonthe
time required by the automatic cuff to measure a BP. The OH
for each measurement was defined using thresholds similar to
theconsensusdefinition,thatis,adecreaseineitherSBPorDBP
of at least 20 or 10 mm Hg, respectively.4,14
Long-term Outcomes: Fall, Fracture, Syncope,
Motor Vehicle Crash, and Death
Fall, fracture, syncope, and motor vehicle crashes were de-
fined at the first occurrence of any related hospitalization or
claimforinpatientoroutpatientservicesafterthebaselinevisit.
These outcomes were identified via 2 sources: (1) active sur-
veillance of all hospitalizations for all ARIC participants; and
(2)linkagetoCentersforMedicareandMedicaidServices(CMS)
claims data from 1991 to 2013 (see eMethods 1 and the eRef-
erences in the Supplement).15,16
Key Points
Question Are orthostatic hypotension assessments performed
within 1 minute of standing as informative for dizziness and
long-term outcomes as assessments performed after 1 minute?
Findings In this cohort study of 11 429 adults with 4 orthostatic
hypotension assessments performed 1 to 2 minutes after standing,
orthostatic hypotension assessed within 1 minute of standing was
associated with higher odds of dizziness and greater risk of falls,
fracture, syncope, motor vehicle crash, and mortality than
orthostatic hypotension assessed after 1 minute.
Meaning Contrary to prevailing recommendations to delay
orthostatic hypotension assessments by 3 minutes, these findings
suggest that orthostatic hypotension should be assessed within 1
minute of standing.

the definitions of these covariates are located in eMethods 2
in the Supplement.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics were compared using means and pro-
portions. We determined the mean time as well as the mean
difference and percentage change in SBP or DBP at each of the
5 measurements.
Using linear splines, we modeled the continuous associa-
tion between postural change in SBP or DBP and baseline his-
tory of dizziness on standing using logistic regression with ad-
justment for age, sex, and race-research center. Knots were
placed at −30, −20, −10, 0, 10, 20, and 30 mm Hg for SBP and
−15, −10, −5, 0, 5, 10, and 15 mm Hg for DBP. We examined diz-
ziness given its hypothesized role in causing falls and its re-
lationship to syncope. We also used logistic regression to ex-
aminetheassociationofOH,posturalchangeinSBP(per5–mm
Hg increment), or postural change in DBP (per 5–mm Hg in-
crement) with baseline history of dizziness on standing. A
5–mm Hg increment was used for both SBP and DBP to facili-
tate interpretation and comparison. These models were ad-
justed for age, sex, race-research center, heart rate, body mass
index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, diabetes, hyper-
tension, alcohol use, education level, smoking status, physi-
cal activity, coronary heart disease, history of stroke, heart
failure, hypertension medication use in past 2 weeks, diuretic
use, antidepressant use, sedative use, hypnotic use, antipsy-
chotic medication use, anticholinergic medication use, resting
SBP, and resting DBP. To directly compare measurements, we
further included measurements 1 to 4 simultaneously in the
model described herein, and in a sensitivity analysis included
measurements 1 to 5 in the model.
We calculated the incidence rates of fall, fracture, syn-
cope, and motor vehicle crash as well as mortality rates (per
1000person-years)forparticipantswithandwithoutOH,using
Poisson regression with a robust variance estimator, adjusted
forage,sex,andrace-researchcenter.Inaddition,wefitteddis-
tinct Cox proportional hazard models with each of the 5 mea-
surements separately to examine the independent associa-
tion of OH, postural change in SBP, and postural change in DBP
with risk of falls, fracture, syncope, motor vehicle crash, or
death. Schoenfeld residuals were plotted over time to test pro-
portionality assumptions. These were adjusted for all the co-
variates listed herein.
Sensitivity analyses were performed using multiple im-
putation chained equations to impute values of missing stand-
ing SBP and DBP measurements as well as missing self-
reported dizziness. In addition, we performed sensitivity
analyses in strata of baseline hypertension, given its associa-
tion with OH.20 We also repeated the analyses with adjust-
mentforpulsepressureaswellasproportionwithbaselineDBP
less than 60 mm Hg. All analyses were conducted using Stata
14.0 (StataCorp LP).
Results
Population Characteristics
The study population (n = 11 429) included 6211 women (54%)
and 2934 black participants (26%), with a mean (SD) age of 54
(5.7) years at baseline (Table 1). Ten percent of the study
population (n = 1138) reported a history of dizziness on stand-
ing prior to initiating the OH protocol. The mean (SD) times in
seconds of measurements 1 to 5 after standing were 28.0 (5.4),
52.6 (7.5), 76.4 (9.1), 100 (10.4), and 116.0 (4.6), respectively
(eTable 2 in the Supplement). The measurement with the larg-
est reduction in SBP from supine to standing positions was
measurement 2 at −1.2 (12.4) mm Hg. Similarly, measurement
2 was associated with the smallest increase in DBP at 2.3 (6.3)
mm Hg.
History of Dizziness
The proportion of participants with a history of dizziness was
higher with greater postural drops in SBP or DBP, particularly
for measurements 1 to 4 at −10 to −20 mm Hg for SBP and at 0
to −5 mm Hg for DBP (Figure 1). Furthermore, measurement 1
was associated with the highest proportion with dizziness at
13.5% (95% CI, 11.0-16.1) (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Sys-
tolic blood pressure or DBP measured during measurement 1
wasassociatedwiththegreatestproportionofparticipantswho
expressed a history of dizziness on standing compared with
the other measurements. Moreover, OH identified at measure-
ment 1 was strongly associated with history of dizziness (OR,
1.49; 95% CI, 1.18-1.89) (Table 2). In contrast, OH assessed at
measurements 2 to 5 was not associated with history of diz-
ziness. Similarly, there there was not an association between
change in SBP and DBP measured at measurement 1 with diz-
ziness alone (not measurements 2-4). Postural change in DBP
at measurement 5 was inversely associated with dizziness (OR,
0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.99).
Long-term Outcomes
Longitudinal incident clinical outcomes were recorded over a
medianfollow-upof23years.Theseeventsincluded2089falls
(18.3% of events), 3104 fractures (27.2%), 2326 syncopal epi-
sodes (20.4%), 426 motor vehicle crashes (3.7%), and 4119
deaths (36.0%). Orthostatic hypotension identified at mea-
surement 1 was associated with the highest incidence and/or
mortalityratesoffracture,syncope,anddeathat18.9,17.0,and
31.4 per 1000 person-years, respectively (Figure 2; eTable 3

 in the Supplement). Orthostatic hypotension identified at
measurement 2 was associated with the highest incidence
rate of falls and motor vehicle crash at 13.2 and 2.5 per 1000
person-years.
After adjustment for covariates, OH determined by mea-
surements1to4wereallsignificantlyassociatedwithfalls,with
measurement 2 demonstrating the strongest association (HR,
1.29; P < .001) (Table 3). Similarly, OH identified in measure-
ments 1 to 2 showed the strongest associations with fracture
at HRs of 1.16 (P = .04) and 1.14 (P = .04). Orthostatic hypo-
tension determined at each of measurements 1 to 5 was sig-
nificantly associated with syncope, while only measurement
2 was significantly associated with motor vehicle crash (HR,
1.43; 95% CI, 1.04-1.96). Finally, regardless of measurement,
the presence of OH was associated with mortality.
When postural change in SBP was modeled as a continu-
ous variable, all measurements were associated with falls, syn-
cope, and mortality. Only values from measurements 1 to 4
were associated with fracture, and only measurement 2 was
significantly associated with motor vehicle crash (HR, 1.04;
95% CI, 1.00-1.09). Similarly, postural change in DBP as a con-
tinuous variable at all measurements was associated with falls,
fracture, syncope, and death. However, none of the measure-
ments were associated with motor vehicle crash.
Sensitivity Analyses
Our findings were confirmed in a comparison of OH from mea-
surements 1 to 4 in models that included all measurements si-
multaneously (see eTable 4 in the Supplement). Measure-
ment 1 was associated with dizziness (OR, 1.59; P = .001),
syncope (HR, 1.21; P = .03), and mortality (HR, 1.15; P = .03),
andmeasurement2wasassociatedwithfalls(HR,1.20;P = .03)
and mortality (HR, 1.22; P = .001). Later measurements were
not associated with dizziness or outcomes (exception: mea-
surement 3 and mortality; HR, 1.15; P = .04). Similarly, when
restricted to the subpopulation with all 5 measurements, only
measurements 1 and 2 were associated with either dizziness
or long-term outcomes (see eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Imputation of missing standing SBP and DBP measure-
ments as well as dizziness did not meaningfully change our
findings (see eTable 6 and eTable 7 in the Supplement). In a
similar fashion, repeating analyses in strata of hypertension
(see eTable 8 and eTable 9 in the Supplement) or adjusting for
pulse pressure and proportion with DBP less than 60 mm Hg
at baseline (see eTable 10 in the Supplement) yielded virtu-
ally similar results.
Discussion
In this middle-aged, community-based population, these data
demonstrate that OH assessments collected within the first 30
secondsafterstandingweremostcloselyassociatedwithaself-
reportedhistoryoforthostaticdizziness.Furthermore,theear-
liestmeasurementwasinformativeastoriskoffuturefall,frac-
ture,syncope,andmortality.Orthostaticassessmentsthatwere
delayed by more than 60 seconds after standing were less in-
formative as to long-term outcomes and were not associated
with dizziness. These findings suggest that the practice of as-
sessing OH within 1 minute of standing provides clinically use-
ful information that may be missed when only later measure-
ments are recorded.
Orthostatic hypotension is an important clinical sign. It is
associated with a number of adverse outcomes, including falls,
coronary heart disease, stroke, and death.1-3 Short-term con-
sequences of OH include lightheadedness, vision problems,
weakness, fatigue, and trouble concentrating.21 It is thought
that these symptoms mediate health outcomes, but in some

 circumstances, such as death, it is unclear whether OH is the
underlying cause or whether it reflects autonomic dysfunc-
tion or another primary disease (eg, heart failure,22 diabetes23)
orneurodegenerativeconditions(eg,Parkinsondisease24).The
identification of clinically important OH has potential treat-
ment implications, as behavioral and pharmacologic interven-
tions might be instituted if OH is identified early. Interven-
tions include physical maneveurs25; compression stockings26;
volume status optimization27; pharmacologic agents, such as
fludricortisone28 or midodrine29; pacemakers30; or simply
avoiding medications known to exacerbate fall risk.31 Thus,
early identification of OH is important for preventing adverse
events.
There is substantial debate over the optimal timing of OH
measurements. In clinical practice, convenience often dic-
tates initiating assessment of orthostatic BP right after stand-
ing, reflecting a scenario similar to measurement 1 in the ARIC
study protocol. However, there have been concerns about as-
sessments occurring too early based on short-term physi-
ologic changes in BP on standing.6 For example, beat-to-beat

ately after rising.32 As a result, a number of studies have ad-
vocated against using BP measurements obtained soon after
standing to assess OH2,7; however, it is unclear how long one
should wait prior to performing the standing measurement.
The original American Autonomic Society and the American
AcademyofNeurologyconsensusdefinitioncalledfora3-min-
utedelay.4Incontrast,somestudieshaveadvocatedforatleast
5 minutes prior to assessment of OH.33,34 Our study showed
that the largest mean reduction in SBP occurred at measure-
ment 2 for SBP and the lowest mean increase in DBP occurred
at measurement 2 (mean changes in DBP were greater than
those in SBP). Furthermore, we show that earlier measure-
ments, particularly those within 1 minute (measurements 1 or
2), were the most informative for both dizziness and long-
term outcomes in this population.
We showed that for the prospective outcomes of interest
as well as for history of dizziness, earlier measurements, that
is, intended for collection within the first minute of standing,
were more informative than later measurements. Both mea-
surements 1 (mean, 28 seconds after standing) and measure-
ment 2 (mean, 53 seconds) were informative as to risk of falls,
fracture, syncope, and mortality. Furthermore, measurement
1 was the only measurement associated with history of dizzi-
ness, and measurement 2 was the only measurement associ-
ated with future risk of a motor vehicle crash. This suggests
that the clinical practice of early OH assessments may be
more informative than the consensus recommendation in
terms of both characterizing concurrent symptoms and iden-
tifying long-term risk. As dizziness reflects the causal path-
way for variable consciousness, possible presyncope or syn-
cope, falls, fractures, and perhaps motor vehicle crashes,35
clinical measurements modeling measurement 1, that is, per-
formed immediately after standing, may ultimately be the
most clinically informative time measurement.
Limitations
This study has a number of limitations that should be consid-
ered if these data are to be considered for use in clinical popu-
lations. First, falls, fracture, syncope, and motor vehicle
crashes were derived from International Classification of Dis-
eases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), codes of hospital records and
CMS claims and were not adjudicated. Prior studies have
shown that while these codes are specific, the use of these
codes is known to be insensitive (clearly demonstrated in the
case of falls15). As a result, associations are likely conservative
owing to underascertainment. Second, there was variability
as to the length of time required by participants to stand as

 well as when time assessments were obtained. Thus, we com-
pared measurement number rather than time of measure-
ment. We believe this is more reflective of real-world sce-
narios in which there are a number of factors that contribute
to variability in the timing of BP assessments. Third, the mea-
surement protocol was designed to terminate with symptoms
of discomfort or dizziness. As a result, ARIC participants miss-
ing 1 of the first 4 measurements likely had a higher preva-
lence of concurrent dizziness with standing. Fourth, driver
status or driver eligibility for ARIC participants was not ascer-
tained and is unknown. As a result, some members of the
study population were less likely to be drivers of motor
vehicle crashes, which would result in lower event rates for
motor vehicle crashes. Fifth, other relevant variables (eg,
fainting spells, cardiac failure, seizures) were not available.
Sixth, the study lacked follow-up OH measurements preclud-
ing examination of change over time.
Conclusions
Our study demonstrates that early assessments of OH (within
1 minute) may be not only time-saving but also most clini-
cally relevant and highly informative for long-term progno-
sis. While our data were derived from a relatively healthy com-
munitypopulation,theyimplythatOHmeasurementprotocols
mightachievetheirgreatestprognosticvaluebyincludingearly

resent compelling evidence for earlier time measurements in
the assessment of OH in middle-aged adults.
