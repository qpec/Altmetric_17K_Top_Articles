IMPORTANCE Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI) in nursing home residents is a
common cause of sepsis, hospital admission, and antimicrobial use leading to colonization
with multidrug-resistant organisms.
OBJECTIVE To develop, implement, and evaluate an intervention to reduce
catheter-associated UTI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A large-scale prospective implementation project was
conducted in community-based nursing homes participating in the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality Safety Program for Long-Term Care. Nursing homes across 48 states,
Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico participated. Implementation of the project was conducted
between March 1, 2014, and August 31, 2016.
INTERVENTIONS The project was implemented over 12-month cohorts and included a
technical bundle: catheter removal, aseptic insertion, using regular assessments, training for
catheter care, and incontinence care planning, as well as a socioadaptive bundle emphasizing
leadership, resident and family engagement, and effective communication.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Urinary catheter use and catheter-associated UTI rates
using National Healthcare Safety Network definitions were collected. Facility-level urine
culture order rates were also obtained. Random-effects negative binomial regression models
were used to examine changes in catheter-associated UTI, catheter utilization, and urine
cultures and adjusted for covariates including ownership, bed size, provision of subacute
care, 5-star rating, presence of an infection control committee, and an infection
preventionist.
RESULTS In 4 cohorts over 30 months, 568 community-based nursing homes were recruited;
404 met inclusion criteria for analysis. The unadjusted catheter-associated UTI rates
decreased from 6.78 to 2.63 infections per 1000 catheter-days. With use of the regression
model and adjustment for facility characteristics, the rates decreased from 6.42 to 3.33
(incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.36-0.58; P < .001). Catheter utilization was 4.5%
at baseline and 4.9% at the end of the project. Catheter utilization remained unchanged
(4.50 at baseline, 4.45 at conclusion of project; IRR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.88-1.03; P = .26) in
adjusted analyses. The number of urine cultures ordered for all residents decreased from 3.49
per 1000 resident-days to 3.08 per 1000 resident-days. Similarly, after adjustment, the rates
were shown to decrease from 3.52 to 3.09 (IRR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.77-0.94; P = .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a large-scale, national implementation project involving
community-based nursing homes, combined technical and socioadaptive catheter-associated
UTI prevention interventions successfully reduced the incidence of catheter-associated UTIs.

ore than 1.4 million people currently reside in nurs-
ing homes across the United States.1 One-third of
Americans aged 65 years or older will receive nurs-
ing home care in their lifetime, with nearly 20% residing in a
nursinghomeforatleast1year.1,2Nursinghomesarecrucialfor
meeting short- and long-term care needs of older adults. Un-
fortunately, preventable complications, such as infection, are
commonly seen in nursing home residents, with approxi-
mately 2 million infections occurring each year.3,4 Nearly 25%
of the short-stay population returns to a hospital for treatment
of an infection, accounting for 325 000 hospital transfers and
over $4 billion in additional annual health care costs.5 Robust
programsarethereforecriticaltopreventinfections,reducean-
timicrobial use and multidrug-resistant organisms, and en-
hance resident safety.
Up to 13% of men and 12% of women have an indwelling
urinary catheter on admission to the nursing home,6-8 and uri-
nary tract infection (UTI) is one of the leading causes of infec-
tion among nursing home residents.3,8-10 Although progress
has been made in reducing catheter utilization with long-
term use at 5% to 8% nationally,6-8 catheters still remain in
place for long periods, leading to higher risk of infections, es-
pecially antimicrobial-resistant infections.10-13 Furthermore,
knowledge of evidence-based practices to care for these de-
vices among health care personnel in the long-term setting is
suboptimal.14,15 Small-scale studies have shown that catheter-
associated UTIs can be successfully reduced within nursing
homes,16 but there is a paucity of studies about how to im-
plement effective prevention efforts in a broad group of
nursing homes nationally. The Agency for Healthcare Re-
search and Quality (AHRQ) funded a large-scale infection pre-
vention project in the nursing home setting, with the goal of
developingandimplementinginterventionstoreducecatheter-
associated UTIs.17
Methods
Overview of the Implementation Project
The AHRQ Safety Program for Long-Term Care: Healthcare-
Associated Infections/Catheter-Associated UTI aimed to re-
duce catheter-associated UTIs in nursing homes. The goal of
this national project was to modify the elements of the Com-
prehensive Unit-Based Safety Program utilized for the AHRQ
Safety Program for Reducing Catheter-Associated UTI in
Hospitals18 to launch an initiative to enhance adoption of
infection prevention practices in nursing homes. The inter-
vention was developed considering a variety of additional
sources, including the Targeted Infection Prevention study.16
It used a combination of technical and socioadaptive inter-
ventions. Technical interventions underscored professional
development in urinary catheter utilization, catheter care
and maintenance, and antimicrobial stewardship. Socioadap-
tive interventions focused on empowering facility teams,
addressing implementation challenges, offering solutions to
overcome barriers, and promoting resident safety culture,
team building, and leadership, as well as resident and family
engagement.17,19 Socioadaptive interventions promote
understanding of the technical components to the end-users,
allow translation of these components into practice, and per-
mit modifications to fit local culture, population, and work
flow.20,21
The Health Research and Educational Trust (HRET), a non-
profit research affiliate of the American Hospital Association,
providedprojectoversightwithsupportfromthenationalproj-
ect team, an interdisciplinary group of experts composed of
faculty members from geriatrics and aging research, general
internal medicine, nursing, infectious diseases, infection pre-
vention, epidemiology, and health services research. Na-
tional project team partners included the University of Michi-
gan, Abt Associates, the Association for Professionals in
Infection Control and Epidemiology, Baylor College of Medi-
cine, Contrast Creative, Qualidigm, and the Society of Hospi-
tal Medicine; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and other federal agencies were interagency partners.
In addition to the national project team, central partners
(ie, lead organizations) supported implementation of the
project. Lead organizations included state hospital associa-
tions, state-based and professional organizations, state and re-
gional organizations with expertise in quality improvement,
National Consumer Voice, and other corporations and health
care organizations. These lead organizations recruited nurs-
ing homes within their constituency (state/region or corpora-
tion), ensured that facilities were actively participating in the
project (eg, attending educational sessions, submitting data),
and disseminated any project-related information, materials,
and resources. Each group of recruited facilities was led by the
local organizational lead, a coach from HRET, and a clinical
content expert from the national team. Guidance was also pro-
vided by a panel of experts on resident safety, catheter-
associated UTI, teamwork, quality improvement, and imple-
mentation.
Health Research and Educational Trust, in coordination
with the lead organizations, recruited nursing homes in 48
states, Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico in 5 cohorts. The re-
sults from the first 4 cohorts, which conducted the implemen-
tation project between March 1, 2014, and August 31, 2016, are
described here. The fourth cohort had a compressed data col-
lection schedule of 10 months. The fifth cohort served as a pi-
lot with a compressed implementation and data collection
Key Points
Question Can a multicomponent initiative focusing on technical
and socioadaptive interventions reduce catheter-associated
urinary tract infection in nursing homes?
Findings In this large-scale national implementation project that
included 404 community-based nursing homes, longitudinal
analysis indicated that Catheter-associated urinary tract infection
rates decreased by 54% and urine culture orders decreased by
15% over the course of the project. Catheter utilization was largely
unchanged.
Meaning A combined technical and socioadaptive
catheter-associated urinary tract infection prevention intervention
successfully reduced the incidence of catheter-associated urinary
tract infection in community-based nursing homes.

 schedule with HRET serving as the organization lead; it is not
included in this analysis. Data from this cohort will be avail-
able on the AHRQ website.
The University of Michigan and HRET institutional re-
view boards reviewed the project and determined it to be qual-
ity improvement activities that did not meet the regulatory
definition of research involving human subjects. Authors with
access to data signed a data confidentiality agreement with
HRET. The data analysis was conducted independent of the
federal sponsor by 3 authors at the University of Michigan
(M.T.G., D.R., and L.M.).
Multicomponent Interventions
Theprojectemphasizedevidenced-basedtechnicalfactors(eg,
reducingindwellingcatheterutilization,improvingcathetercare
andmaintenance,andantimicrobialstewardship)aswellasso-
cioadaptivefactors(eg,promotingresidentsafetyculture,team
building, and leadership engagement) to prevent catheter-
associated UTIs. The technical bundle highlighted key inter-
ventions: catheter removal, aseptic insertion, using regular
assessments and feedback, training for catheter care, and in-
continence care planning and hydration practices (eFigure 1
in the Supplement).17,22 The project focused on residents
with indwelling urinary catheters. This bundle included
foundational infection prevention strategies (eg, hand
hygiene, barrier precautions, and education for infection pre-
ventionists, frontline staff, residents, and families), as well as
catheter-associated UTI prevention-specific strategies (eg,
prompt removal of unnecessary catheters on admission,
adopting evidence-based practices for catheter maintenance
and insertion, reducing inappropriate catheter use, and con-
sidering alternatives to indwelling urinary catheters) (Box).23
Antimicrobial stewardship and appropriate use of diagnostic
tests, such as urinalysis and urine culture, were also empha-
sized. The technical bundle was used as a framework for edu-
cational materials, toolkits, and interactive activities (eFigure
1 in the Supplement). This technical bundle was comple-
mented by the socioadaptive bundle that focused on enhanc-
ing attitudes and behaviors related to infection prevention
practices and overall resident safety in nursing homes.
Emphasis was placed on creating safety teams; engaging
leadership, frontline staff, residents, and family members;
enhancing communication strategies pertinent to resident
safety; and sustained progress toward goals.
Education on the technical and socioadaptive bundles was
provided through in-person or virtual learning sessions, in-
teractive activities,24 coaching calls, and webinars (eFigure 2
in the Supplement).17 Three learning sessionsâ1 each at the
project start, midpoint, and endâwere provided for each co-
hort.Monthlycoachingcallsledbythelocalorganizationallead
and national project team faculty provided facility teams an
opportunity to review data, discuss project implementation,
and learn from each other by sharing successes and barriers.
Onboarding and training webinars at the start of the project
prepared facility teams to implement technical and socioad-
aptive interventions. These initial sessions were followed by
monthly content webinars presented by faculty experts on
the technical and socioadaptive principles of catheter-
associated UTI prevention. A list of educational presentation
topics used for the onboarding, training, and monthly con-
tent webinars is given in eAppendix 1 in the Supplement. Or-
ganizational leads and coaches across the cohorts also partici-
pated in a separate monthly call to review data trends, learn
by sharing, identify barriers, and provide feedback to the
Box. Technical Bundle: Remember C.A.U.T.I. to prevent CAUTI
Infections are the leading cause of illness and death in nursing
homes.
These infections include catheter-associated urinary tract
infections (CAUTIs).
Remember: No catheter means no CAUTI!
C: Catheter Removal
Think about catheters in any of your residents. Are the catheters
really necessary?
Remove the catheter if there is no good indication for it.
(See below.)
Every resident deserves a chance to be catheter free and infection
free.
A: Aseptic Insertion
Only trained personnel should insert catheters.
Use hand hygiene, and insert using aseptic technique.
Use the smallest catheter size that will allow good drainage for the
resident.
Use catheter securement devices.
U: Use Regular Assessments
Implement a process to assess at regular intervals whether a
resident needs a catheter.
Insert new urinary catheters only where there is a good indication.
Incontinence is NOT an appropriate indication for an indwelling
urinary catheter.
Routinely consider alternatives to using a urinary catheter.
Use a bladder ultrasound to guide management.
T: Training for Catheter Care
Train staff, resident, and family.
Maintain a closed drainage system, and maintain unobstructed
urine flow.
Use routine hygiene. Do not clean the periurethral area with
antiseptics.
Routine catheter changes, urinalysis, and cultures are not
required.
I: Incontinence Care Planning
Develop an incontinence care plan for each resident, including
behavioral interventions.
Appropriate Indications for an Indwelling Urinary Catheter
To assist in healing of open sacral or perineal wounds in
incontinent residents
For acute urinary retention or bladder outlet obstruction
To improve comfort for end-of-life care if needed

website hosted by HRET as well as disseminated by
organizational leads.
Project Outcomes and Data Collection
The primary outcome was the catheter-associated UTI inci-
dence rate defined as in the CDCâs National Healthcare
Safety Network (NHSN) as the number of catheter-
associated UTIs meeting long-term care surveillance criteria
divided by the number of catheter-days and multiplied by
1000 (CDCâs NHSN protocol for tracking infections in long-
term care facilities; January 2015).25 Unlike clinical defini-
tions that rely on physician diagnosis and antibiotic pre-
scribing, NHSN surveillance criteria incorporate objective
systemic and localizing clinical findings with laboratory-
based criteria to define catheter-associated UTI.25 The uri-
nary catheter utilization ratio was a secondary outcome,
defined as the number of catheter-days divided by the num-
ber of resident-days multiplied by 100 and reported as a
percentage. Facility teams were coached on data collection
at the start of the project and provided with practical
hands-on tools to facilitate outcome measurement (https:
//www.ahrq.gov/professionals/quality-patient-safety/quality-
resources/tools/cauti-ltc/infection-surveillance.html). These
included surveillance pocket cards (https://www.ahrq.gov
/professionals/quality-patient-safety/quality-resources/tools
/cauti-ltc/modules/resources/tools/cauti-surveillance/pocket-
card.html), simplified instructions to gather monthly data

/professionals/quality-patient-safety/quality-resources/tools
/cauti-ltc/modules/resources/tools/cauti-surveillance/data-

resources/tools/cauti-ltc/modules/resources/tools/cauti-
surveillance/assessment.html and https://www.ahrq.gov
/professionals/quality-patient-safety/quality-resources/tools
/cauti-ltc/modules/resources/tools/cauti-surveillance/review-
form.html). Completeness of surveillance data collection was
actively monitored by the organizational leads and the project
managementteams.Beginningwiththesecondcohort,facility-
leveldataonurinecultureorderswerecollectedasanobjective
process measure and potential proxy for appropriate urine
testing, given research suggesting that reducing overuse of
urine cultures can decrease potential overdiagnosis and
antimicrobial prescribing.26 This is a finite and measurable
outcome that can be accessed readily from administrative
databases and thus reduce data collection burden on
facilities.26 The number of urine culture orders for all residents
(both catheterized and noncatheterized) while in the facility
(excluding, eg, emergency department, hospital inpatient, and
outpatient visits) was standardized by dividing by the number
of resident-days and multiplying by 1000.
Participating nursing homes collected data on the daily
number of catheter-associated UTIs, catheter days, resident
days, and urine cultures for each month of the project period
(eFigure 2 in the Supplement). The expectation for data col-
lectionoftheabovemetricswasthatnursinghomessharetheir
data with the national project team each month throughout

Statistical Analysis
To examine the changes in catheter-associated UTI rates and
catheter utilization during the project, we used multilevel
mixed-effects negative binomial regression. Random inter-
cepts and slopes for time at the facility level were included to
accommodate the nested-data structure. The log of the num-
ber of catheter-days was used as an offset for models examin-
ing changes in the NHSN catheter-associated UTI rate. The
log of the number of resident-days was used as an offset for
the catheter utilization models. Data were collected in aggre-
gate every month for 12 months. The data were then ana-
lyzed by setting the first month's reported data to time zero,
with each subsequent month being the number of days from
the first reporting period. The 12th reporting period is 335
days from the first period; therefore, the time variable was
divided by 335 to give an incidence rate ratio (IRR) represent-
ing change over the course of the project. All models were
adjusted for the following facility characteristics: ownership,
chain affiliation, bed size (calculated as the total number of
beds divided by 10 so that the IRR represents a 10-bed
increase, allowing easier interpretation of the IRR and 95%
CI), provision of subacute care (yes/no), 5-star rating, having
an infection preventionist with 3 or more years of experience,
and presence of an infection prevention committee. We also
assessed cohort effects over time in additional sensitivity
analysis models.
Allparticipatingcommunity-basednursinghomeswerein-
cluded in the analysis if they remained active through the end
of their cohort period and reported 2 months or more of out-
come data and device-days. This analytic sample included 404
units from 38 states. Nursing homes reporting improbable data
(eg, large fluctuations in reported device-days or resident-
days from month to month within a given nursing home) were
identified and excluded from the analytic data set. In addi-
tion, nursing homes missing one or more demographic char-
acteristics were excluded from the multivariable analysis.
Nursing home characteristics and broader measures of
quality of care (ie, unrelated to catheter-associated UTI rates)
were assessed using descriptive statistics from data from the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Certification
andSurveyProviderEnhancedReportingdatabase,27theMini-
mum Data Set,28 and the Nursing Home Compare 5-Star Qual-
ity Rating System. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Ser-
vices (CMS) 5-star Quality Rating System gives each nursing
homearatingofbetween1and5stars.29,30Nursinghomeswith
5 stars are considered to have much above average quality and
nursing homes with 1 star are considered to have quality much
below average.29,30 To ensure generalizability of the results,
the participating nursing homesâ baseline characteristics and
5-star ratings were compared with those of the rest of the na-

 tion using 1-way analysis of variance. In addition, as a test for
unintended consequences of participation in the project on
overall quality of care, we compared changes in 5-star ratings
over time (2016 compared with 2013), using linear regression
withadjustmentforclusteringbytheprojectcohorts.Forthese
national comparisons, nursing homes missing a federal iden-
tifier or quality measures were excluded from the analysis.
Givenattritioninthenumberofnursinghomessubmittingdata
over the course of the project, we also conducted a sensitivity
analysis to examine whether changes in catheter-associated
UTI rates differed between nursing homes that did and those
that did not complete data submission. All reported P values
are 2-sided, and P < .05 was regarded as statistically signifi-
cant. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata/MP soft-
ware, version 13.1 (StataCorp).
Results
Characteristics of the Nursing Homes
A total of 568 community-based nursing homes were
recruited in cohorts 1 through 4. However, 164 nursing
homes were excluded from the analyses for one or more of
the following reasons: withdrew from the project, did not
report outcome data for at least 2 months, reported no
device days, or reported improbable data (Figure 1). The
most frequently cited reasons for withdrawal from the proj-
ect included time constraints and other competing priorities
(n = 65) as well as staff turnover and shortages (n = 54).
Therefore, we present data from 404 nursing homes that
completed the project.
Participating nursing homes had a mean (SD) bed size of
120.7 (67.6) beds, 260 (67.2%) were for-profit, and 218
(56.3%) were part of a chain (Table 1). Compared with non-

 participating nursing homes nationally,27-30 participating
nursing homes were slightly larger and had a higher mean
overall quality-of-care 5-star rating. There were no signifi-
cant differences in ownership, percentage of CMS-certified
beds, resident complexity as measured by the case-mix
index, or percentage of residents receiving antibiotics.
Seventy-two percent of nursing homes reported having an
infection preventionist with 3 or more years of experience
and spent a mean (SD) of 11.0 (9.9) hours per week on infec-
tion prevention activities.31
Changes in Catheter-Associated UTI Rates, Catheter Use,
and Urine Culture Orders
Catheter-associated UTI rates steadily decreased from 6.78
per 1000 catheter-days (333 catheter-associated UTIs/
49 140 catheter-days) at the beginning of the project to 4.17
per 1000 catheter days (211/50 618 catheter-days) at the
midpoint and 2.63 per 1000 catheter-days (70 catheter-
associated UTIs/26 610 catheter-days) at the end of the proj-
ect period (Figure 2). The total number of catheter-
associated UTIs and catheter-days by project month are
displayed in eTable 1 in the Supplement. A total of 368 nurs-
ing homes had data available for our covariates of interest.
After adjustment for facility characteristics, the incidence of
catheter-associated UTIs was reduced from 6.42 to 3.33 per
1000 catheter-days (IRR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.36-0.58; P < .001)
(Table 2). Furthermore, 276 of 368 (75.0%) of the nursing
homes reported at least 40% reduction in catheter-
associated UTI rates. Although nonprofit nursing homes had
lower catheter-associated UTI rates at baseline compared to
for-profit nursing homes (4.33 vs 8.15 catheter-associated
UTIs per 1000 catheter-days, respectively), rate reductions
from baseline were similar for both groups over the course
of the project. Changes in catheter-associated UTI rates over
the project did not differ significantly by cohort. Catheter
utilization did not change substantially during the project
period, with 4.5% catheter use at the start of the project and
4.9% use at the end of the project period. After adjustment,
catheter utilization remained steady, with rates of 4.50 at
baseline and 4.45 at the end of the project (IRR, 0.95; 95%
CI, 0.88-1.03; P = .26) (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Urine
culture order rates, after adjusting for facility characteris-
tics, decreased from 3.49 urine cultures per 1000 resident-
days at the beginning of the project to 3.08 urine cultures
per 1000 resident-days at the end of the project. The results
were similar in our adjusted model, with urine culture rates
decreasing from 3.52 to 3.09 (IRR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.77-0.94;
P = .001).
Sensitivity Analyses
Of the 368 nursing homes in the primary analysis with data
for all covariates included in adjusted models, 228 (62.0%)
submitted all requested data for each assessment period.
Among these 228 nursing homes, the catheter-associated
UTI rate decreased by 50% (IRR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.66;
P < .001) by the end of the project period. At least 70% of
the expected data were submitted by 318 nursing homes
(86.4%) and, among these facilities, there was a decrease of
55% in the catheter-associated UTI rate (IRR, 0.45; 95% CI,
0.35 to 0.58; P < .001). The overall 5-star rating among par-
ticipating facilities (n = 404) improved by 0.02 points from
before the project (2013) to after the project (2016), and the
overall rating for nonparticipating facilities (n = 14 308)
declined by 0.09 points during the same time period. How-
ever, the change in overall 5-star rating over time (2016 vs
2013) did not differ between participating and nonpartici-
pating nursing homes (Î² = 0.12 points; 95% CI, â0.36 to

Discussion
In this large-scale implementation project conducted in na-
tionwide cohorts of nursing homes, we report a reduction in
catheter-associated UTI rates by 54% over the 12-month pe-
riod. With 75.0% of the facilities showing a reduction of 40%
ormore,wedemonstratethatthesereductionscanbeachieved
by most of the facilities. Furthermore, we noted a reduction
in the frequency of orders for urine cultures, highlighting that
stewardship can be applied to the use of laboratory diagnos-
tics that often lead to inappropriate use of antibiotics.26,32 With
a well-designed implementation framework tailored toward
a frail, aging population with longer stays in the nursing home,
this implementation project exemplifies that reducing infec-
tionsandenhancingthesafetyofolderadultsinnursinghomes
is attainable.
Our findings add new information about how to effec-
tively promote reduction in health careâassociated infec-
tions in a geographically diverse and broad group of nursing
homes. A successful cluster-randomized study in 12 nursing
homes conducted by Mody and colleagues16 involved active
surveillance for device-associated infections and multidrug-
resistant organisms with simple feedback, an interactive
educational program emphasizing both overall infection
prevention and device care,24 and preemptive barrier pre-
cautions during high-risk activities. Furthermore, cost-
effectiveness analysis showed that this intervention is
expected to save $39 000 per year with most savings due to
a reduction in hospitalization related to catheter-associated
UTIs.33 The findings of overall reductions in clinically
defined antibiotic-treated catheter-associated UTI rates by
31% and time to first catheter-associated UTI by 45%16
based on patient-level data closely mirror findings from
the larger implementation project reported herein, which
used the more conservative standardized nursing homeâ
specific NHSN surveillance criteria to define outcomes. Our
findings also align with a recent report by Saint and
colleagues18 that showed a 32% reduction in catheter-
associated UTI rates in non-intensive care units participat-
ing in the AHRQ Safety Program for Reducing Catheter-
Associated UTIs in Hospitals.
Catheter utilization did not decrease during the project
period perhaps, in part, because utilization rates were low in
the nursing homes at the start of this project. With catheter
use being a CMS publicly reported measure since 1990,29,30
nursing homes have already developed a culture of prompt re-
moval of catheters once clinical need is resolved.34 An assess-
ment of catheter-associated UTI prevention practices at the
start of this project showed that a high percentage of nursing
homes required documentation of indications as well as a phy-
sician order for catheter use.31 As a result, unnecessary uri-
narycathetersweregenerallyremovedwithin48hoursofnurs-
ing home admission. Moreover, catheters are seen by nursing
caregivers as an impediment to functional independence of
older nursing home residents.35
The catheter-associated UTI reductions seen within our
project are likely to be the result of several factors. First, the
technical bundle emphasized foundational infection preven-
tion strategies as well as strategies specific to catheter use.36
In particular, with low rates of catheter utilization, our inter-
vention focused primarily on evidence-based strategies for
catheterinsertionandmaintenance,37hydrationpractices,and
appropriate use of diagnostic testing as shown by reductions
in urine culture order rates.38 Evidence suggests that inter-
ventions targeting overuse of urine cultures can lead to re-
duced urine culture orders, potential overdiagnosis, and sub-
sequent antimicrobial use.26 Our project further confirms that
such interventions can be effective in nursing homes where
urinary catheters, when used, are in place for prolonged pe-
riods of time. Second, our educational sessions were in-
formed by knowledge and practice gaps identified by prior lit-
erature and a needs assessment conducted at the start of the
project.24,32 The educational sessions were interactive and in-
cluded streamlined versions of each session to be used by the
facility teams for their front-line personnel, including info-
graphics, simplified train-the-trainer materials, and pocket
cards.16,24 Third, attention to socioadaptive elements modi-
fiedfromsuccessfullarge-scalestudiesinacutecare18,39,40was
an explicit and unique part of the intervention to facilitate
adoption of the technical bundle. Fourth, facility teams re-
ceived sustained external support from the projectâs network
of local organizational leads and coaches through monthly
coaching calls with the national project team, learning from
peer teams at other facilities, and being part of this national
implementation project. For example, monthly support pro-
vided by the local organizational leads and coaches that dis-
cussed monthly surveillance data, implementation chal-
lenges, and strategies to overcome barriers helped facilities to
understand their infection data in relation to local and na-
tional benchmarks and with targeted feedback to enhance evi-
dence-based practices, hence making their surveillance data
actionable. These external partners helped to identify oppor-
tunities for improvement that then empowered facility teams
to lead and sustain local efforts.
Limitations
Our implementation project needs to be considered in the con-
text of the following limitations. We engaged nursing homes
that voluntarily agreed to participate. Although this is one of
the largest infection prevention projects, these interventions
may not be successful in all US nursing homes, particularly
those without support from external partners. Moreover, with
the use of multiple strategies and tools simultaneously, iden-
tifying a single component that would explain our results is
not possible. Since this was not a randomized controlled trial,
our results could be confounded by unmeasured variables. We
did not collect data on antimicrobial use, and catheter-
associated UTIs reported by nursing homes were not indepen-
dently verified as meeting NHSN criteria. However, we are en-
couraged that the reductions in catheter-associated UTI rates
mirror rate reductions achieved by a patient-oriented cluster-

 randomized study.16 Furthermore, we could not compare our
results with the catheter-associated UTI rates of nonpartici-
patingfacilities.Unlikehospitals,veryfewnursinghomes(<1%)
report catheter-associated UTI rates within the NHSN sys-
tem, although UTI reporting has been identified as a priority
within the Department of Health and Human Services Na-
tional Action Plan to Prevent Healthcare-Associated
Infections.41 Finally, although a common limitation of large-
scale studies,18 it is possible that nursing homes that with-
drew from the project or did not submit all expected data were
not successful in implementing or sustaining this approach to
catheter-associated UTI prevention.
Conclusions

technical and socioadaptive interventions, reduced catheter-

eter use is prolonged. Although this project focused on reduc-

evidence-based implementation framework can be used to ad-
dress other resident safety issues in community-based nursing
homes.
