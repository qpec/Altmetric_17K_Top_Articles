Abstract: High-throughput transcriptome sequencing allows for the unbiased detection of viruses
in host tissues. The application of this technique to immunosuppressed animals facilitates the
detection of viruses that might otherwise be excluded or contained in immunocompetent individuals.
To identify potential viral pathogens infecting domestic cats we performed high-throughput
transcriptome sequencing of tissues from cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).
A novel member of the Hepadnaviridae, tentatively named domestic cat hepadnavirus, was discovered
in a lymphoma sample and its complete 3187 bp genome characterized. Phylogenetic analysis placed
the domestic cat hepadnavirus as a divergent member of mammalian orthohepadnaviruses that
exhibits no close relationship to any other virus. DNA extracted from whole blood from pet cats
was positive for the novel hepadnavirus by PCR in 6 of 60 (10%) FIV-infected cats and 2 of 63 (3.2%)
FIV-uninfected cats. The higher prevalence of hepadnavirus viraemia detected in FIV-infected cats
mirrors that seen in human immunodeficiency virus-infected humans coinfected with hepatitis
B virus. In summary, we report the first hepadnavirus infection in a carnivore and the first in a
companion animal. The natural history, epidemiology and pathogenic potential of domestic cat
hepadnavirus merits additional investigation.

Viruses of the genus Orthohepadnavirus, family Hepadnaviridae, are partially double-stranded DNA
viruses that infect a variety of mammals including primates, bats and rodents. The type species,
hepatitis B virus (HBV), is a major public health problem; chronic HBV infection increases the risk of
liver diseases including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and an estimated 257 million people
are currently living with HBV [1].
We identified a new hepadnavirus in a domestic cat from Australia. In 2016, a seven year-old
male-neutered domestic shorthair cat was presented for vomiting and weight loss. On physical

examination a large mid-abdominal mass was palpated. Fine needle aspirate cytology of the mass was
consistent with large cell lymphoma. The owners requested euthanasia and necropsy and consented
to tissue collection approved by the University of Sydney animal ethics committee, (2014/626).
Multicentric, large cell, high-grade, B-cell lymphoma was diagnosed on immunohistopathology
of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. Infection with the immunosuppressive lentivirus, feline
immunodeficiency virus (FIV), was diagnosed by serology for anti-FIV antibody (Witness FIV/FeLV,
Zoetis) and PCR of tumour DNA confirmed by sequencing as described previously [2]. Lymphoma
tissue from this case was utilized in a virus discovery project.
Total RNA extracted from frozen lymphoma was enriched for non-ribosomal RNA and Illumina
TruSeq paired-end libraries were prepared. Briefly, 30 mg of lymphoma was homogenised using 1.4 mm
ceramic beads (OMNI Homogeniser, Kennesaw, GA, USA), total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen
RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) followed by on-column DNA removal to remove genomic
DNA. RNA quality, examined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Mulgrave,
VIC, Australia), demonstrated RNA integrity numbers greater than eight. Library preparation was
performed using a TruSeq RNA library preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and ribosomal
RNA was removed using a Ribo-Zero gold epidemiology kit (Illumina, USA). RNA sequencing of
100 bp pair-end libraries on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (San Diego, CA, USA) yielded 321,297,408
total reads. Sequencing reads were uploaded onto the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database
under the BioProject submission SUB3718346.
To identify potential viral transcripts, sequencing reads were assembled de novo using the
Trinity software (version 2.1.1) [3]. The resulting contigs were then blasted against the non-redundant
nucleotide database (nt) using blastn program with an E-value threshold of 1 × 10−10 and against
the non-redundant protein database (nr) using Diamond version 0.8.28.90 with an E-value threshold
of 1 × 10−4 [4]. To discover viruses at low abundance, we performed Diamond blastx analyses on
sequence reads against the nr database. The virus-associated contigs and reads were recovered based
on the taxonomic annotation of each blast hit. Each positive hit was subsequently confirmed by
manually inspecting the nucleotide or amino acid sequence alignment with their closest relatives.
To exclude the potential presence of endogenous virus (EVEs) in the blast results, we also blasted the
reads/contigs against the cat genome sequences available at the reference genome database and the
whole genome shotgun database. In total, eight HBV-like reads were identified that shared 73–94%
amino acid identity with the core protein, surface protein, and polymerase of known hepadnaviruses.
This suggested the presence of a novel virus that was divergent from currently known hepadnaviruses.
To confirm the presence of the hepadnavirus, DNA was extracted from frozen lymphoma and
examined with a panhepadnavirus PCR assay targeting the polymerase ORF [5]. A 250 bp product
was obtained and sequenced, thereby validating the RNA sequencing. To amplify the entire genome
of the novel hepadnavirus from lymphoma tissue, a five primer-set PCR was designed based on
recovered reads (Table 1). PCR reactions were performed using Bioline MyTaq HotStart polymerase
(Bioline, Australia) based on the manufacturer’s recommended protocol, using 200–500 ng of template
DNA, 1× MyTaq buffer, a final primer concentration of 0.4 µM in a 50 µL reaction and an annealing
temperature ranging from 55 to 58 ◦C. For primer sets Hgap-F/R and Cir5-F/Cir4-R a final primer
concentration of 0.3 µM was used. The amplicons were sequenced (Macrogen, Seoul, South Korea)
and analysed using Geneious version 11.2.0 and the entire 3187 bp circular genome was assembled
(Figure 1). The genome contained the polymerase (P), surface (S), core (C) and X ORFs typical of
orthohepadnaviruses. Notably, the complete P protein exhibited between 63.2% to 68.7% amino
acid similarity to known orthohepadnaviruses. Such a large genetic distance merits assignment
of a new species within the genus Orthohepadnavirus, which we tentatively named domestic cat
hepadnavirus. The complete genome sequence of domestic cat hepadnavirus has been deposited in
GenBank, accession number MH307930.

sequences representative of the viral diversity in other vertebrates [6,7] were added to the alignment.
In the case of the more divergent C and S ORFs, data sets of orthohepadnaviruses only were constructed,
utilizing the hepadnavirus from the bluegill (GenBank accession KX058433) as an outgroup [6].
However, because of the small size of the X ORF gene alignment, the lack of an appropriate outgroup
for this ORF, and because it is largely contained within the other ORFs, the X ORF was excluded from
the analysis. All amino acid sequences were aligned using MAFFT (version 7) [8], and all ambiguously
aligned regions were removed using TrimAl [9]. This process resulted in final data sets of the following
sizes: P protein = 30 taxa, 419 amino acids; C protein = 16 taxa, 182 amino acids; S ORF = 16 taxa, 255
amino acids.
Phylogenetic trees of all three data sets were inferred using the maximum likelihood approach
available in PhyML 3.0, employing the LG + Γ model of amino acid substitution and a SPR
branch-swapping algorithm [6]. In the case of the P ORF phylogeny (Figure 2A) it is striking that
although domestic cat hepadnavirus clearly groups with the mammalian orthohepadnaviruses, it was the
most basal member of this group, including those viruses recently identified in bats [10], and exhibited no
close phylogenetic relationship to any other hepadnavirus [11]. This divergent position was also well
supported by SH-like branch supports (value of 0.84) separating domestic cat hepadnavirus from the other
mammalian hepadnaviruses. Less phylogenetic resolution (i.e., lower SH-like branch supports at key
nodes) and differing topologies (such as the position of the tent-making bat) are apparent in the shorter
C (Figure 2B) and S (Figure 2C) ORF alignments, although domestic cat hepadnavirus was consistently
distinct from all other orthohepadnaviruses. Although this analysis clearly shows that domestic cat
hepadnavirus is evolutionarily distinct, its exact phylogenetic position is uncertain.
Hepadnaviruses are typically hepatotropic, although viraemia is common in immunosuppressed
hosts [12]. To investigate whether this immunosuppressed cat was viraemic for the novel hepadnavirus,
PCR was performed on DNA extracted from autologous frozen whole blood using primer set
Hgap-F/R (Table 1). A positive result on PCR was confirmed by sequencing. Next, a molecular survey
for hepadnavirus viraemia was performed using DNA extracted from stored whole blood from adult
pet cats in Australia (University of Sydney Animal Ethics Committee approvals N00/7-2013/3/6029
and 2016/1002). The novel hepadnavirus was detected in whole blood from 6 of 60 (10%) FIV-infected
cats and 2 of 63 (3.2%) uninfected cats. Confirmation of this finding in larger studies is awaited.
Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that a similar pattern is seen among HIV infected humans where HBV
is a common co-pathogen [13]. For example, in USA and Europe the prevalence of persistent HBV
antigenaemia is 1% in the general population compared with 7–10% among HIV-infected homosexual
men who are more likely to be exposed to and less likely to clear HBV [14].
In conclusion, we report the first hepadnavirus infection in a member of the mammalian
order Carnivora and the first report of a hepadnavirus in a companion species, with hepadnavirus
viraemia commonly detected among FIV-infected cats. Future investigation of the natural history and
epidemiology of domestic cat hepadnavirus and its impact on feline health is clearly warranted.
