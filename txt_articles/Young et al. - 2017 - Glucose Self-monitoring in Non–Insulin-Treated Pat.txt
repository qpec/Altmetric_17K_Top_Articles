IMPORTANCE The value of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) levels in patients with
non–insulin-treated type 2 diabetes has been debated.
OBJECTIVE To compare 3 approaches of SMBG for effects on hemoglobin A1c levels and
health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among people with non–insulin-treated type 2 diabetes
in primary care practice.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Monitor Trial study was a pragmatic, open-label
randomized trial conducted in 15 primary care practices in central North Carolina. Participants
were randomized between January 2014 and July 2015. Eligible patients with type 2
non–insulin-treated diabetes were: older than 30 years, established with a primary care
physician at a participating practice, had glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c) levels higher than
6.5% but lower than 9.5% within the 6 months preceding screening, as obtained from the
electronic medical record, and willing to comply with the results of random assignment into a
study group. Of the 1032 assessed for eligibility, 450 were randomized.
INTERVENTIONS No SMBG, once-daily SMBG, and once-daily SMBG with enhanced patient
feedback including automatic tailored messages delivered via the meter.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Coprimary outcomes included hemoglobin A1c levels and
HRQOL at 52 weeks.
RESULTS A total of 450 patients were randomized and 418 (92.9%) completed the final visit.
There were no significant differences in hemoglobin A1c levels across all 3 groups (P = .74;
estimated adjusted mean hemoglobin A1c difference, SMBG with messaging vs no SMBG,
−0.09%; 95% CI, −0.31% to 0.14%; SMBG vs no SMBG, −0.05%; 95% CI, −0.27% to 0.17%).
There were also no significant differences found in HRQOL. There were no notable
differences in key adverse events including hypoglycemia frequency, health care utilization,
or insulin initiation.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In patients with non–insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, we
observed no clinically or statistically significant differences at 1 year in glycemic control or
HRQOL between patients who performed SMBG compared with those who did not perform
SMBG. The addition of this type of tailored feedback provided through messaging via a meter
did not provide any advantage in glycemic control.

 T
he value of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)
for patients with non–insulin-treated type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM) has been debated,1-7 yet over 75%
perform regular SMBG.8 Several trials showed significant
benefit from SMBG on glycemic control,9-12 while others
found no evidence of benefit.7,13-16 Proponents postulate that
testing promotes better awareness of glucose levels, leading
to improvements in diet and lifestyle. However, harms from
routine SMBG in patients with non–insulin-treated T2DM are
possible.17,18
Studies of enhanced SMBG, where patients and/or clini-
cians were educated to better interpret SMBG values, found
hemoglobin A1c reductions close to 0.5%,3,10,19,20 compared
with simple SMBG, where levels were reduced by 0.2%, an
amount that was statistically significant but of doubtful clini-
cal significance.3,21 This pattern suggests that, for SMBG to be
an effective self-management tool in non–insulin-treated
T2DM, the patient and physician must actively engage in per-
forming, interpreting, and acting on the SMBG values.
Our goal was to answer the following question: Is SMBG
effective for people with non–insulin-treated T2DM in terms
of improving either hemoglobin A1c levels or health-related
quality of life (HRQOL)?
Methods
Trial Design
We performed this pragmatic trial across 15 primary care prac-
tices in central North Carolina. The trial was funded by the Pa-
tient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute Diabetes stake-
holders provided input during grant design, implementation,
and dissemination.22 The trial protocol (Supplement 1) was re-
viewed and approved by the University of North Carolina in-
stitutional review board. Written informed consent was ob-
tained and participants were compensated with $50 for filling
out baseline and follow-up surveys. Participants in the test-
ing arms also received a meter and test strips. Patients with
non–insulin-treated T2DM were randomly assigned to 1 of 3
arms: (1) no SMBG; (2) standard once-daily SMBG consisting
of glucose values immediately reported to the patient through
themeter;and(3)enhancedonce-dailySMBGconsistingofglu-
cose values immediately reported to the patient plus auto-
mated, tailored messaging delivered to the patient through a
Telcare meter. The messaging algorithm accounted for blood
glucosevalue,timeofday,andrelationshiptofoodintake.Mes-
sages were intended to educate and motivate patients (eTable
2 in Supplement 2). Time- and date-stamped data uploaded
from the meters allowed the study team to monitor daily me-
ter use in the SMBG arms. Following randomization, primary
care clinicians guided participants’routine diabetes manage-
ment. Clinicians received summaries of SMBG data and po-
tential treatment options based on American Diabetes Asso-
ciation Standards of Care1 through the electronic health record
for patients in both testing arms. The recommendations were
not prescriptive and clinicians were encouraged to use them
based on clinical situation. Participants were reassessed at 52
weeks following randomization.
Patients
Eligibility criteria included: (1) T2DM, (2) 30 years or older,
(3) established patient at a participating practice, (4) hemo-
globin A1c levels between 6.5% and 9.5% within 6 months pre-
ceding screening, and (5) willing to be randomly assigned to a
study group. Patients were excluded if they planned to see an
endocrinologist in the upcoming year, currently or planned to
use insulin during study period, planned to become pregnant
or relocate in the next year, or had other conditions that would
put them at risk in following study protocol. Patients were not
excluded if they had prior SMBG experience.
Baseline Procedures
After study field staff obtained written informed consent, pa-
tients completed an interview that included demographic,
health history, and patient-reported measures. Patients had a
hemoglobin A1c blood test and height and weight were re-
corded.Thefieldcoordinatorthenopenedanumbered,opaque
randomization envelope containing group assignment. Ran-
domization was stratified by practice and used randomly per-
muted blocks of sizes 15 and 18 generated by a biostatistics re-
search assistant not otherwise involved in the study. The field
coordinator taught patients randomized to the testing groups
howtousethemeter.Allparticipantsreceivededucationalbro-
chures describing blood glucose goals and symptoms of hy-
poglycemia and hyperglycemia.
Outcomes
The 2 primary outcomes were change in hemoglobin A1c lev-
els and in HRQOL. Hemoglobin A1c levels were measured at
baseline and again at a mean (SD) 52 (6) weeks from baseline
visit. For the first 40 patients enrolled, baseline hemoglobin
A1c levels were measured by total glycated hemoglobin; gly-
cosylated hemoglobin was calculated using a published for-
mula by the processing laboratory. The remainder of patients
had their hemoglobin A1c levels measured by glycosylated he-
moglobin by a single laboratory at baseline and follow up vis-
its. Intermediate hemoglobin A1c values were captured pas-
sively from the electronic health record. We assessed HRQOL
Key Points
Question Is self-monitoring blood glucose levels effective for
people with non–insulin-treated type 2 diabetes in terms of
improving either hemoglobin A1c levels or health-related quality of
life (HRQOL) in primary care practice?
Findings In this pragmatic randomized clinical trial that included
450 patients randomized to 1 of 3 groups: no self-monitoring of
blood glucose (SMBG), once-daily SMBG, and once-daily SMBG
with enhanced patient feedback. There were no significant
differences in glycemic control across all groups, nor were there
significant differences found in HRQOL.
Meaning Routine self-monitoring of blood glucose levels does not
significantly improve hemoglobin A1c levels or HRQOL for most
patients with non–insulin-treated type 2 diabetes; patients and
clinicians should consider the specifics of each clinical situation as
they decide whether to test or not to test.

 using physical and mental component scores of the Short-
Form 36 (SF-36).23 Secondary outcomes included Problem
Areas In Diabetes,24 Diabetes Symptoms Checklist,25 and
Diabetes Empowerment Scale26 to assess diabetes-specific
HRQOL and self-efficacy. We examined diabetes self-care
through the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities
measure.27 Treatment satisfaction and provider-patient com-
munication were assessed through the Diabetes Treatment
Satisfaction Questionnaire28 and the Communication Assess-
ment Tool.29
Preidentifiedpotentiallystudy-relatedadverseevents(AEs)
included finger stick infections and severe hypoglycemia.
Emergency department and hospitalizations alerts from the
electronic health record allowed review of intrastudy events,
which were adjudicated by committee. At follow-up, partici-
pants were queried regarding any urgent care, emergency de-
partment visit, hospitalization, finger stick infection, and hy-
poglycemic episode over the past 52 weeks.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated power for the 2 df overall tests comparing our
primary outcomes across all 3 groups. Assuming a common
standard deviation for change in hemoglobin A1c levels of 0.8%
and no more than 10% loss to follow-up, randomizing 150 pa-
tients per group would provide at least 90% power to detect a
mean difference of −0.325% between the SMBG and no SMBG
groups at the .05 significance level. Assuming a HRQOL stan-
dard deviation of 10 points, this sample size would provide at
least80%powertodetectanoveralldifferencebetweengroups
if the mean difference between the highest and lowest groups
was at least 4 points on either component of the HRQOL scale
at the .025 level (Bonferroni-corrected for 2 components).
For primary analyses, all randomized patients were ana-
lyzed according to their group regardless of the extent to which
they performed SMBG (intention-to-treat, ITT). The statisti-
cian remained blinded to treatment groups until after final-
ization of programming for primary comparisons. Missing 52-
week outcome data were ignored for primary analyses. We
compared change in hemoglobin A1c levels from baseline
through 52 weeks across the 3 randomization groups using an
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) conducted at the .05 signifi-
cance level. This model controlled for site, baseline hemoglo-
bin A1c levels, whether baseline hemoglobin A1c levels were di-
rectly measured or calculated, use of SMBG at baseline,
duration of diabetes, baseline use of antihyperglycemic treat-
ment (sulfonylurea or glinide), age, race/ethnicity, health lit-
eracy, and number of comorbidities. Had the overall test been
rejected, we planned to compare each SMBG group to the no
testing group separately using the Dunnett-Tamhane Step-Up
procedure.30 We also conducted a contrast test comparing the
average of the 2 SMBG groups to the no SMBG group at the .05
level. ANCOVA similar models were used to compare groups
for change in HRQOL component scores as well as listed sec-
ondary outcomes; besides the covariates listed above, each of
thesemodelscontrolledforcorrespondingbaselinescalescore.
Additionally, we explored potential for effect modification by
each baseline variable included in the models by adding ap-
propriate interaction terms to the ANCOVA model 1 at a time.

tiated insulin use during the study or who were not suffi-
ciently compliant with their assigned treatment. In the testing
arms, we excluded participants who uploaded a meter reading
fewer than 80% of their days in the study, and in the no testing
armweexcludedparticipantswhoadmittedtoevertestingwith
any regularity during the study. Second, we repeated the AN-

mediate hemoglobin A1c values captured from the electronic
health record, excluding any following initiation of insulin use.

Results
Overview of Trial Conduct
A total of 450 patients underwent randomization from Janu-
ary 2014 to July 2015 (Figure 1). A total of 92.9% of patients
completed the final visit and provided data on both out-
comes (hemoglobin A1c levels and HRQOL). The demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics were similar among groups
(Table 1). The mean age was 61 years old, patients had diabe-
tes an average of 8 years, 75% were performing SMBG at base-
line, and 38% had low health literacy (less than 4 on the New-
est Vital Sign).31 Patient testing preference at baseline was
similar among groups with 22% preferring no SMBG and 40%
preferring to self-monitor. The majority were taking metfor-
min (80%), followed by sulphonylurea (35%).

 Primary Outcomes
At 1 year, we found no evidence that SMBG led to improved

SMBG arms vs no SMBG, 0 points; 95% CI, −1.40 to 1.40).
Secondary Outcomes
We did not find significant differences in patient-reported out-
comes by the Problem Areas in Diabetes, Diabetes Symptom
Checklist, Diabetes Empowerment Scale, Diabetes Treat-
ment Satisfaction, or the Communication Assessment Tool
(Table 3). There were significant differences in the Summary
of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (mean change 0.01 points, 0.51
points,and0.45points,inthenoSMBG,SMBG,andSMBGwith
messaging, respectively; overall, P < .001). However, this was
owing to the influence of the SMBG intervention (blood glu-
cose testing subscale mean change, −1.46 points, 2.94 points,
2.81 points in the no SMBG, SMBG, and SMBG with messag-
ing,respectively;overall,P < .001).Amongthearms,therewere
nosignificantdifferencesininsulininitiation(8.6%,4.0%,5.4%
in the no SMBG, SMBG, SMBG with messaging, respectively;
overall, P = .23). Patients in the SMBG groups taking a GLP-1
agonist at baseline were significantly more likely to increase
their dose compared with patients in the no SMBG group
(P = .02), but the numbers were small (eTable 1 in Supplement
2). In addition, patients in the SMBG with messaging group
were significantly more likely to start using thiazolidinedi-
one (P = .01), but again the numbers were small. No other com-
parisons of medication use differed significantly between
groups.
Sensitivity Analyses
In per-protocol and last observation carried forward analy-
ses, results were not notably different from those in the pri-
mary analyses. We did find evidence that mean hemoglobin
A1c values differed across groups over time. At 6 months, the
estimated mean hemoglobin A1c difference between the test-
ing arms and the no testing arm was −0.33% (95% CI, −0.54%
to -0.12%; P = .002). By 12 months, the mean differences be-
tween groups are similar to the primary analysis and do not
show a significant difference. (Figure 2A).
Effect Modification
In analyses exploring potential for effect modification of pre-
specified subgroups (prior experience using SMBG, T2DM du-
ration, baseline glycemic control, baseline insulin secreta-
gogue use, age, race/ethnicity, health literacy, and number of
baseline comorbidities), there were no significant interac-
tions for glycemic control. For the HRQOL physical compo-

 nent score, we did identify a significant interaction by race
(P = .02);AfricanAmericansintheSMBGwithmessaginggroup
reported significantly lower HRQOL than the no testing group,
but the same was not true for the SMBG without messaging
group (estimated adjusted mean differences of SF-36 physi-
cal component score for African Americans: SMBG with mes-
saging vs no SMBG, −2.91 points; 95% CI, −5.69 to −0.13; SMBG
vs no SMBG, 0.78 points; 95% CI, −1.91 to 3.47) (eFigures 1-3
in Supplement 2).
Testing Compliance
Compliance dropped consistently in both SMBG groups, with
a larger initial decrease after 1 month in the SMBG with mes-
saging arm (Figure 2B). In the no SMBG arm, 36 (23.7% ) pa-
tients reported that they tested a few times per month or more,
2 (1%) tested once per month, and 13 (8.5%) tested less than
once per month during the study.
Safety and Adverse Events
The following adverse events occurred during the study: 0 fin-
gerstick infections, 1 severe hypoglycemia (secondary to uro-
sepsis, recurrent bladder neoplasm, and acute kidney in-
jury), 62 hospitalizations (no difference by arm), and 2 deaths
(1 during cardiac surgery and 1 owing to amyotrophic laterals
sclerosis). None of the adverse events were adjudicated to be
study-related.

 Discussion
After 1 year, we identified no clinically or statistically signifi-
cant differences in glycemic control or HRQOL between pa-
tients who performed once-daily SMBG compared with those
who did not perform SMBG. The addition of instant tailored
feedback messages via a meter did not improve glycemic con-
trol. This null result occurred despite training participants and
primarycarecliniciansontheuseandinterpretationoftheme-
terresults.Thesefindingsalignwithearlierstudiesandagroup
that reinforce the limited utility of SMBG in patients with non–
insulin-treated T2DM.4,5,7,13-16,32 Surprisingly, SMBG has re-
mained a cornerstone in the clinical management of non–
insulin-treated T2DM, in part fueled by other studies and
groups supporting glycemic control with SMBG.9-12,33-35 As the
first large pragmatic US trial of SMBG, our findings provide evi-
dence to guide patients and clinicians making important clini-
cal decisions about routine blood glucose monitoring. Health
care clinicians are typically divided on this issue; most uni-
versally either do or do not recommend SMBG monitoring.1,32
In addition, patient testing preferences are variable; in our
study, patient testing preference at baseline was split. Based
on these findings, patients and clinicians should engage in dia-
logue regarding SMBG with the current evidence suggesting
that SMBG should not be routine for most patients with non–
insulin-treated T2DM. Our study was not powered to deter-
mine effectiveness in certain clinical situations, such as ini-
tiationofnewmedicationormedicationdosechanges.Patients
and clinicians should consider each situation as they deter-
mine whether to test or not to test.
Patients were drawn from primary care practices; where
most patients with T2DM receive their care. Most were on un-
complicatedmedicaltherapiesincludingmetformin(80%)and
sulphonylureas (36%) and carried the diagnosis of T2DM for
a median of 6 years. Given that only 66 (15%) patients had
T2DM for a year or less, it is not surprising that most were ex-
perienced with SMBG (338, 75%) at baseline. In addition, com-
pliancewithtestingshowedprogressiveattritioninbothSMBG
monitoring groups. Although not a primary outcome, this may
explain the statistically significant improvements in hemo-
globin A1c levels initially seen between the testing and non-
testing arms in the early months, but no significance at the pri-
mary outcome of 12 months. It is possible that the intervention
was off putting in some way causing user fatigue or provided
false reassurance.
Proponents of routine SMBG have cited evidence that this
testing approach is useful for patients with newly diagnosed
diabetes or patients with poorer glycemic control.10 Al-
though disease duration, experience using SMBG, baseline gly-
cemic control, antihyperglycemic treatment, age, race, health
literacy,andnumberofcomorbiditiesmadenodiscernabledif-
ference in glycemic control at 52 weeks, absence of evidence
is not evidence of absence. This trial was not powered for sec-
ondary analyses. Only race was significant by interaction test-
ing for HRQOL physical component score; African Americans
in the SMBG with messaging group had significantly lower
scores. Given multiple comparisons across groups, the find-
ing may be spurious.
Incorporating technology into self-management activi-
ties has been touted as potentially transformative for pa-
tients, and to date some smaller studies36,37 support this no-
tion. However, our findings do not. It is possible that the
enhancement of SMBG with one-way messaging back to the
patientdoesnotadequatelyengagepatients.Thisnotionissup-
ported by the sensitivity analyses that showed that over the
first 6 months glycemic control improved for all patients en-
gaging in SMBG regardless of messaging type. However, dur-

polynomial regression with linear mixed models using all observed hemoglobin
A1c values, including those at interim visits, but excluding any following insulin

450 patients; only 10 patients contributed no interim hemoglobin A1c
measurements and the median number was 4. The intervals represent
pointwise 95% CIs for each group, and the P values compare the average of the
SMBG groups with the no SMBG group. B, Daily proportions of patients in the

 ing months 6 through 12, improvements in glycemic control
regressed back to baseline. A more interactive approach or the
useof2-waymessagingbetweenthepatientandphysicianmay
improve the durability of this approach.
Althoughdesignedwithaneyetowardthereal-worldclini-
cal setting, our study team did not engage with the patients be-
yond the baseline visit. Clinicians likewise had minimal inter-
action with the study team. Thus, we do not have data on what
the clinicians did with the summary of blood glucose results.
More active engagement of both patients and clinicians may
have improved patient outcomes, although this would have di-
minished the pragmatic nature of this study. Most (338, 75%)
patients had some experience with SMBG at baseline and 161
(36%)weretakingoralhypoglycemics.PriortrialsofSMBGwere
heterogeneous; many did not describe SMBG use at baseline.
Limitations
Although our resultant population is more of a test of continu-
ing monitoring, rather than initiating monitoring, the ques-
tion remains equally relevant. The population included were
willingtoberandomized;thismaynotreflectthetypicalpopu-
lation of patients with T2DM. In addition, not all patients ad-
hered to the group to which they were assigned; however, per-
protocol analyses were not notably different from the intent-
to-treat analyses. There is also a possibility that those
participating might be generally good at self-care, so an auto-
mated system may add less than in other populations. Be-
cause our population included patients with T2DM not using
insulin, these results cannot be generalized to insulin users.
Furthermore, participating primary care practices were affili-
ated with a single health care system, though patients were
typical of those found in primary care nationally.38
Conclusions
Inpatientswithnon–insulin-treatedT2DM,therewerenoclini-
cally or statistically significant differences at 1 year in glyce-
mic control or HRQOL between patients who performed SMBG
compared with those who did not perform SMBG. These find-
ings suggest that glucose monitoring in patients with non–
insulin-treated T2DM should not be routine.

Editor's Note
The Need to Test Strategies Based on Common Sense
Elaine C. Khoong, MD, MS; Joseph S. Ross, MD, MHS
“You have diabetes.”
In most care settings, this statement still triggers prescrip-
tion of a glucometer and instruction on how to perform self-
monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Every 3 months there-
after, patients’glucose logs are reviewed and routine SMBG
is encouraged, regardless of
patients’risk of hypoglyce-
m i a
or severe hyperglycemia, because common sense tells us that
patients who proactively manage and monitor their diabetes
should achieve better outcomes. In this issue of JAMA Inter-
nal Medicine, Young and colleagues1 test this long-held belief,
randomizing 450 patients with non–insulin-dependent type
2 diabetes to no SMBG, SMBG, and SMBG with enhanced
patient feedback. At 1 year, there were no differences in gly-
cemic control, health-related quality of life, or adverse events
(including hypoglycemia frequency, health care utilization,
or insulin initiation). Nearly 75% of patients engaged in rou-
tine SMBG prior to enrollment. These results suggest that we
can safely advise patients to discontinue, as well as not initi-
ate, SMBG.
This important study was funded by the Patient-Centered
Outcomes Research Institute and illustrates how patient-
centered clinical research can address clinical problems. The
surprising findings make us question the current seemingly
common sense–based strategy to encourage routine SMBG.
These findings and others2 support the Choosing Wisely3
recommendations of the Society of General Internal Medi-
cine and Endocrine Society that discourage frequent blood
glucose monitoring among patients with type 2 diabetes.
Routine SMBG merits a “less is more” designation because
there were no clear benefits accrued, which leaves only pos-
sible harms.
