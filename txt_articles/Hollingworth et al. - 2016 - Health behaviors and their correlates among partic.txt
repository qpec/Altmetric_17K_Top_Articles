Background and aims: We used data from the Continuing to Confront COPD International 
Patient Survey to test the hypothesis that patients with COPD who report less engagement with 
their disease management are also more likely to report greater impact of the disease.
Methods: This was a population-based, cross-sectional survey of 4,343 subjects aged $40 years 
from 12 countries, fulfilling a case definition of COPD based on self-reported physician diagnosis 
or symptomatology. The impact of COPD was measured with COPD Assessment Test, modified 
Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale, and hospital admissions and emergency department 
visits for COPD in the prior year. The 13-item Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13) instrument 
and the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) were used to measure patient 
disease engagement and medication adherence, respectively.
Results: Twenty-eight percent of subjects reported being either disengaged or struggling 
with their disease (low engagement: PAM-13 levels 1 and 2), and 35% reported poor adher-
ence (MMAS-8 ,6). In univariate analyses, lower PAM-13 and MMAS-8 scores were 
significantly associated with poorer COPD-specific health status, greater breathlessness and 
lower BMI (PAM-13 only), less satisfaction with their doctor’s management of COPD, and 
more emergency department visits. In multivariate regression models, poor satisfaction with 
their doctor’s management of COPD was significantly associated with both low PAM-13 
and MMAS-8 scores; low PAM-13 scores were additionally independently associated with 
higher COPD Assessment Test and modified Medical Research Council scores and low BMI 
(underweight).
Conclusion: Poor patient engagement and medication adherence are frequent and associated 
with worse COPD-specific health status, higher health care utilization, and lower satisfaction 
with health care providers. More research will be needed to better understand what factors can 
be modified to improve medication adherence and patient engagement.
Keywords: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, patient survey, patient engagement,

Introduction
When managing chronic diseases, understanding the patients’ perspective in terms of 
expectations, concerns, and beliefs about their disease could result in better patient–
physician communications and consequently improve management of the disease.1 
Personality traits and health care beliefs are likely to affect patient perceptions of 
care and could in turn influence the understanding between patients and physicians. 
These types of patient traits have been defined as “patient’s engagement” and can be 
quantified using survey instruments, such as the Patient Activation Measure (PAM).2

Studies in patients with chronic conditions have shown that 
greater engagement (higher PAM score) is associated with 
an improvement in patient health-related behaviors.3,4 These 
data suggest that patients who are better engaged with their 
disease by actively participating in their own care are more 
likely to have better health outcomes. For example, programs 
that promote self-management or patient-centered chronic 
care initiatives in COPD have been shown to reduce health 
care resource utilization, including COPD-related hospital 
admissions.5,6
Patient engagement with their disease can also be 
reflected in reported or measured adherence to prescribed 
medication. Good adherence to prescribed COPD medication 
has been associated with reduced all-cause mortality and 
hospital admissions due to COPD exacerbations.7,8 However, 
adherence among COPD patients is often poor.9–13
We hypothesized that COPD patients who report lower 
levels of engagement or medication adherence would report 
a greater burden of COPD in terms of humanistic impact 
(health status), symptom control, and health care utilization 
than patients who report greater engagement or adherence. 
Further, we aimed to identify factors associated with patients’ 
level of engagement with COPD and adherence with COPD 
treatment.
Methods
study design
The study objectives that were explored in the Continuing 
to Confront COPD International Patient Survey, have been 
described previously;14 a detailed description of the survey 
sampling methods can be found in the online appendix. This 
was a population-based survey of 4,343 adults who fulfilled 
a case definition of COPD defined as adults aged 40 years 
and older who reported 1) a physician diagnosis of COPD/
emphysema, 2) a physician diagnosis of chronic bronchitis, or 
3) met a symptom-based definition of chronic bronchitis and 
were either taking respiratory medication for their condition 
or had chronic cough with phlegm most days. A history of 
smoking was not required as part of the case definition for 
this study. The survey was conducted in 12 countries; Brazil, 
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, 
Russia, South Korea, Spain, the UK, and the US.
Participation in the survey was entirely voluntary and 
confidential, and all subject data were anonymous. The 
survey protocol and consent procedure were reviewed by 
the Abt SRBI Institutional Review Board (registered with 
the Office for Protection from Research Risks, Health and 
Human Services) and granted an Institutional Review Board 
exemption as the criteria for exemption under 45 CFR 
46.101(b) (2) of the United States Code of Federal Regula-
tions were met. In countries where face-to-face interviews 
were conducted in the respondents’ home, modest incentives 
may have been offered, the value of which was less than 
US$6 (eg, mobile phone top-up card, tea, chocolates). In 
Japan, the members of the online panel were compensated 
by the panel provider directly, typically $11. No other incen-
tives were provided.
Patients completed a structured questionnaire about their 
COPD disease severity, respiratory symptoms, treatment for 
COPD, health care resource use for exacerbations of COPD 
in the prior 12 months (number of emergency department 
visits and number of hospitalizations), smoking history and 
toxic exposures, and overall satisfaction with their doctor’s 
management and treatment of COPD. Symptom severity 
was assessed using the modified Medical Research Council 
(mMRC) Dyspnea Scale,15 and health status with the COPD 
Assessment Test (CAT).16,17 The primary hypotheses were 
addressed using the PAM-13,2 and Morisky Medication 
Adherence Scale (MMAS)-8.18 Validated translations of 
the patient reported outcome instruments were used and 
permission for their use was obtained.
Patient activation Measure-13
The PAM-13 was used to measure patients’ self-confidence 
in their role in managing their disease and assertiveness in 
dealing with the health care systems.2 This scale evaluates 
patients’ responsibility, attitude, confidence, knowledge, and 
understanding of their disease.
PAM-13 yields a scaled score ranging from 0 to 100 that 
assigns a patient to one of four levels:
• Level 1 (PAM-13 score of 47.0 or lower): disengaged 
and overwhelmed
• Level 2 (PAM-13 score of 47.1 to 55.1): becoming 
aware but still struggling
• Level 3 (PAM-13 score of 55.2 to 67.0): taking action
• Level 4 (PAM-13 score of 67.1 or above): maintaining 
behaviors and pushing further.
Morisky Medication adherence scale-8
The MMAS-8 is an 8-item, self-reported measure of 
adherence in recent users of medication (recall period is 
14 days).18
Each question is given either a dichotomous or Likert 
scale-type response resulting in an overall score which 
ranges from 1 to 8, with higher scores indicating greater 
adherence. Adherence is classified as low (score 1–5),

overall score.
statistical analyses
Analyses related to patient engagement were conducted in 
4,339 respondents. Analysis of patient adherence was lim-
ited to 3,135 respondents who reported taking medication 
in the past 14 days and thus were eligible to complete 
MMAS-8.
All analyses were weighted using a summary survey 
weight variable to address factors of age and sex sampling 
specific to each country and also to adjust for the propor-
tion of each country’s contribution to the study population. 
Therefore, all percentages presented in the paper are 
weighted percentages. Differences in demographic, 
clinical, and behavioral traits across levels of PAM-13 
and MMAS-8 were tested using weighted chi-square test 
for categorical variables and proportional odds model for 
continuous variables. Weighted logistic regression multi-
variate models (PROC SURVEYLOGISTICS) were used 
to determine factors associated with (a) poor adherence 
(MMAS-8 score ,6) and (b) poor patient engagement 
(PAM-13 levels 1 and 2) using characteristics showing 
a significant univariate relationship with each respective 
outcome and country. All analyses were conducted in 
SAS v9.3.
Results
In the population of 4,343 respondents who fulfilled the 
survey definition of COPD, the mean age was 60.7 years 
(standard deviation 12.1 years), 48% were male, and 64% 
were current or former smokers.14 Distribution of traits in the 
subsample not completing the MMAS-8 was mostly identical 
or differed nonsignificantly (data not shown).
Patient engagement with COPD 
management and its determinants
The majority of respondents with valid PAM-13 scores 
(N=4,339) indicated high PAM-13 scores with 51% scoring 
at the highest Level 4 and 22% at Level 3 (Table 1). However, 
15% of respondents were disengaged and overwhelmed by 
their disease (Level 1) and 13% described themselves as strug-
gling with their disease (Level 2). Weighted mean value for 
the PAM-13 score was 66.75 (standard deviation 17.90).

Univariate analysis showed that patients with low 
PAM-13 scores were more often male, had lower BMI, 
reported worse COPD-specific health status (higher CAT 
score), worse breathlessness on exertion (mMRC $2), were 
less likely to have undergone a past spirometry test, and 
reported taking fewer COPD medications (Table 1). Patients 
with low PAM-13 scores were also more likely to report 
that they were “somewhat or very dissatisfied” with how 
their physician manages their disease (P,0.001) (Figure 1; 
Table 1) and were less likely to report being involved in 
treatment decisions/having a disease management plan 
(P,0.001) (Table 1). In the multivariate model (using char-
acteristics showing a significant univariate relationship with 
each respective outcome and including country), independent 
factors associated with low levels of engagement (PAM-13 
Levels 1 and 2) included increased breathlessness (mMRC 
score $1), lower patient satisfaction with their doctor, low 
BMI (,18.5 kg/m2; underweight), and poorer COPD-specific 
health status (higher CAT score) (Table 2).
Patient reported adherence with COPD 
treatment and its determinants
Patient adherence results were based on 3,135 (72%) of 
respondents who reported taking medication in the past 
14 days and had completed the MMAS-8. Low MMAS-8 
scores (poor adherence) were reported by 39% of patients, 
with 35% reporting medium and 27% high adherence 
(Table 3).
Patients with low MMAS-8 score were younger, more 
often females, reported poorer COPD-specific health status 
(higher CAT scores), were less likely to have undergone a 
past spirometry test, and were slightly more likely to have 
attended an emergency department in the previous 12 months 
(Table 3). Patients reporting low or medium adherence more 
often reported having $2 comorbidities compared with those 
reporting high adherence. Poor adherers were also more 
likely to report that they were “somewhat or very dissatis-
fied” with how their doctors manage their COPD (P,0.001) 
(Figure 2; Table 3) and were less likely to report being

Discussion
In our analysis of the Continuing to Confront COPD Inter-
national Patient Survey, we report the first data on patient 
engagement in a large sample of respondents fulfilling the 
study definition of COPD. We observed that almost a third 
(28%) of respondents struggled to understand their COPD 
and were not actively engaged in the management of their 
disease as indicated by low PAM-13 scores. Further, a large 
number of respondents (39%) reported poor adherence with 
COPD medications as indicated by low MMAS-8 scores. 
COPD patient disengagement and lack of adherence to COPD 
medications were associated with greater symptom burden 
and poorer satisfaction with health care providers.
In a survey of a representative general population sample 
of almost 18,000 adult residents of the US, 41% of respon-
dents reported the highest level of engagement,19 compa-
rable with our estimate of 50% of respondents reporting the 
highest level of engagement. However, in our survey, more 
than twice as many patients reported the lowest level of 
engagement (15% vs 7%). Low engagement has also been 
reported to be highly prevalent among patients with other

chronic debilitating diseases;20–23 however, we identified 
only one other study reporting data on patient engagement 
in COPD.24 This study of 205 COPD patients, which focused 
on retraining of health behaviors, showed a mean PAM-13 
score at baseline (59.0), which is lower than that reported in 
our study (66.75).
When considering medication adherence, it has been 
reported that in developed countries, 50% of patients with 
chronic disease do not take their medications as prescribed.25 
This level of nonadherence has also been reported in COPD 
patients receiving home nebulizer therapy.26,27 George et al28

health behaviors and their correlates in COPD
adherence report scale) to assess adherence in COPD patients 
identified through respiratory support groups and from a 
pulmonary rehabilitation database, and also reported a higher 
prevalence of nonadherence (63%) than that reported in the 
current survey. Another recently published study evaluating 
the adherence of COPD patients in a clinical setting using the 
MMAS-4 reported poor adherence among 29.5% of COPD 
patients, an estimate comparable with our survey.12 These 
examples illustrate the reported variability in the prevalence 
of adherence to treatment in COPD when assessed using a 
range of methods or instruments in differing populations.
Both of these traits, poor patient engagement and adher-
ence, were related to low levels of satisfaction with COPD 
management by health care professionals, poorer COPD-
specific health status (CAT score), and potentially either more 
severe or less well-controlled disease as indicated by more 
frequent emergency department visits. In a multivariate model 
environment, satisfaction with their doctors’ management of 
COPD appeared as the major factor impacting both engage-
ment and adherence. Patients satisfied with their doctors as 
well as those feeling more actively involved in decisions about 
their treatment reported higher engagement and adherence 
scores. Consistent with this, George et al28 reported that the 
amount of time doctors spent with patients was a key determi-
nant of medication adherence. Several studies have highlighted 
that establishing a good doctor–patient relationship is neces-
sary for fostering patient engagement in the consultation.29,30
Additional factors independently associated with low 
engagement were poorer COPD-specific health status 
(CAT) and the level of reported breathlessness as measured 
with mMRC. Breathlessness has been described as the 
most troublesome symptom by patients with COPD and 
is a leading cause of disability.31 While poor engagement 
was associated with poor COPD-specific health status and 
COPD symptoms (breathlessness) in multivariate modeling, 
these relationships were not maintained with the medication 
adherence outcome in multivariate modeling. Similarly, the 
relationship between prior health care utilization for COPD 
exacerbations (hospital/emergency department visits), 
although related to both low engagement and poor adher-
ence on univariate testing, was attenuated for both in the 
multivariate model. Several factors could have contributed 
to such observations: patients with high engagement level 
could potentially represent a mixed population of patients 
from the extremes of the disease, that is, those with a 
low disease severity as well as those with severe dyspnea 
and poor health status. This hypothesis will be addressed 
in a further analysis. The potential lack of temporality 
of self-reported prior emergency department visits and

Müllerová et al
hospitalizations for COPD and PAM-13 and MMAS-8 
assessments limits the ability to study any mutual relation-
ships. Further, health care utilization patterns significantly 
differ across regions and the three geographical areas of 
Asia, South America, and US/Europe represented in this 
survey may have introduced heterogeneity. We also found 
a relationship between BMI (underweight, overweight, and 
obese) and low patient engagement. Such a relationship was 
described by Fowles et al in a cohort of US employees.32 
In their analysis, lower BMI predicted higher activation. 
We have treated BMI as a nonlinear variable, based on our 
a priori knowledge of an association of BMI with patient 
reported outcomes in COPD;33 hence, we have shown that 
being underweight, often associated with poorer outcomes 
in COPD, is also related to poorer activation.
Other factors that were independent predictors of poor 
adherence were current smokers, younger age (,65 years), 
and presence of $2 comorbidities. A cross-sectional survey 
of employees from a large US company, using a medical and 
pharmacy claims database, also showed for a range of chronic 
conditions that smokers were significantly less adherent to 
medications than nonsmokers.34 Better adherence in older 
patients with chronic diseases, including COPD, has been 
shown in other studies.11,35 Further, others have reported on 
an association between increased number of comorbidities 
and poorer adherence.11 This is an important point for treat-
ing physicians. As the numbers of comorbidities increase, 
so too typically do the number of medications prescribed to 
a patient. Our data suggest these represent “at risk patients” 
and in particular those who are poorly engaged may be even 
more likely to be nonadherent to complex and frequently 
expensive drug regimens.
Improved patient engagement may be expected to 
translate into better control of disease and result in lower 
disease burden. However, the Continuing to Confront COPD 
International Patient Survey provides cross-sectional data so 
we cannot infer the impact of these findings on long-term 
outcomes in COPD patients. In the area of management 
of diabetes, patient engagement interventions resulted in 
modest improvements in intermediate outcomes, such as 
hemoglobin A1c, but the evidence supporting clinically 
important outcomes was considered as weak.36 One study 
in COPD assessed the impact of repeated training sessions 
on patient engagement, disease symptom burden, and 
health-related quality of life.24 Although the intervention 
significantly improved the level of engagement, disease bur-
den and health-related quality of life remained unchanged, 
highlighting the need for additional research. For patients, 
this may involve managing their COPD more effectively or 
could also be a case of better management of their comor-
bidities, which may also result in better overall health and 
outcomes.37 However, at the highest level of engagement, 
patients may still struggle to maintain healthy behaviors 
but report having the skills and confidence to manage their 
health more proactively, which may in turn reduce the effect 
of any intervention.19
A limitation of our results and their interpretation is 
that the survey sampling method recruited patients from 
the general population which may have resulted in a patient 
group reporting milder disease than that usually observed 
in a health care setting. A quarter of patients had not taken 
any medications for COPD in the 2 weeks prior to the sur-
vey which may reflect a milder population but which could 
also have been related to cultural variation in access to 
medication. In addition, selection bias is another potential 
limitation of this type of population-based survey. While a 
large international span across three continents increased 
the representativeness of the results, it is also likely to have 
introduced heterogeneity with respect to cultural aspects 
of expected patient and health care provider roles, and dif-
ferences in access to health care. In addition, we assessed 
disease burden using only a limited number of measures, 
mainly patient self-reported outcomes. Approximately 80% 
of the population self-reported that they had undergone a past 
spirometry test but confirmation of spirometric diagnosis of 
COPD by a review of patient records was not within the scope 
of this survey. Although a third of our patient population 
reported that they had never smoked, which is traditionally 
atypical of a diagnosed COPD population, a review by Zeng 
et al38 also reported the high burden of COPD in nonsmokers, 
highlighting the variation in its prevalence across regions. 
The frequency of nonsmokers in this study is still higher 
than in any study in the review by Zeng et al in Western 
countries (around 23%), but relatively comparable to the US 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (~32% 
for patients with spirometry results suggestive of airway 
obstruction).38,39 Finally, despite collecting extensive data 
on patient characteristics, we cannot rule out the fact that 
unmeasured and important confounding factors may have 
accrued and impacted our findings.
Conclusion
About a third of patients with COPD sampled from the 
general population do not feel engaged or involved with 
their COPD management and often report nonadherence 
with treatment. COPD patients reporting disengagement and

lack of adherence to COPD medications also report greater 
symptom burden and less satisfaction with their COPD 
management. Further research is needed to identify how best 
to help these patients and whether psychosocial, cultural, and/
or biological factors are driving these associations.
