Abstract
Objective—Providing portion-controlled prepackaged foods in a behavioral counseling 
intervention may promote more weight and fat loss than a standard self-selected diet. Methods: 
The primary aim was to test whether providing portion-controlled prepackaged lunch and dinner 
entrées within a behavioral weight loss intervention promotes greater weight loss at 12 weeks in 
overweight/obese adults compared to self-selected foods. Other aims were to examine effects on 
biological factors, fitness, and meal satisfaction. One-half of those assigned to prepackaged entrées 
were provided items with a higher protein level (>25% energy) as an exploratory aim.
Results—Participants (N=183) had a baseline weight of 95.9 (15.6) kg (mean [SD]) and BMI of 
33.2 (3.5) kg/m2. Weight data at 12 weeks were available for 180 subjects. Weight loss for regular 
entrée, higher protein entrée and control groups was 8.6 (3.9), 7.8 (5.1), and 6.0 (4.4)%, 
respectively (P<0.05, intervention vs. control). Intervention participants lost more body fat than 
controls (5.7 [3.4] vs. 4.4 [3.3] kg, P<0.05).
Conclusions—A meal plan incorporating portion-controlled prepackaged entrées promotes 
greater weight and fat loss than a standard self-selected diet, with comparable meal satisfaction. 
Initial weight loss predicts long-term weight loss so these results are relevant to likelihood of 
longer term success.

Introduction
Achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight is challenging for many people, as evident 
in the high prevalence of obesity in the U.S. today (1). The ultimate determinant of weight 
change is energy intake relative to expenditure, so a reduction in energy intake is the primary

 dietary factor that must be addressed to promote weight loss and maintenance (2). Increased 
portion sizes have been observed in the U.S. food environment over the past few decades 
and is one factor that promotes higher energy intake, likely contributing to the increased 
prevalence of obesity over this time frame (3). Thus, portion control may play a key role in 
weight management (4).
Providing liquid meal replacements or prepackaged foods is one portion control strategy that 
may promote more weight loss than standard dietary and behavioral counseling. A recent 
review concluded that prescribing meal replacements or prepackaged foods is a 
scientifically-supported strategy that should be among the clinical recommendations to 
promote weight control (5). Although provision of liquid meal replacements and 
prepackaged foods are often grouped as being equivalent strategies for use in promoting 
weight loss (5, 6), they are not nutritionally equivalent. Whole, regular foods that comprise 
prepackaged entrées provide bioactive food components, greater palatability and texture, in 
addition to essential nutrients, in contrast with composite food products such as meal 
replacement beverages and bars. Also, providing prepackaged foods may overcome barriers 
to long-term adherence by allowing a variety of tastes and textures that are lacking in liquid 
meal replacements.
Early studies that compared a structured meal plan, with or without food provision, to 
standard dietary and behavioral counseling in an 18-month intervention increased initial 
weight loss by 50% and by 100% one year later (7, 8). Two more recent but shorter-term 
studies found that providing two prepackaged entrées/day compared to meals that were self-
selected promoted greater weight and fat loss, in addition to improving cardiovascular 
disease risk factors, over an 8-week period (9, 10). In those studies, which did not include 
behavioral or exercise counseling, average weight loss for women was 7.6% vs. 5.2%, and 
6.5% vs. 4.2% for men, in the prepackaged entrée vs. self-selected diet groups, respectively. 
A comparison of prescribing commercially-available prepackaged foods to standard diet 
counseling in the context of behavioral weight loss counseling has not been previously 
conducted or reported, and this dual approach could result in increased weight loss and 
greater likelihood of sustained behavior change. Notably, satisfaction with food and meal 
plans may be critical for adherence and acceptability, which would affect long-term 
usefulness of this recommendation in weight management.
The primary aim of this study was to test whether providing portion-controlled prepackaged 
lunch and dinner entrées, compared to a standard self-selected diet, in the context of a 
reduced-energy diet prescription and behavioral counseling promotes greater weight loss at 
12 weeks in overweight and obese men and women. Additional aims were to describe the 
effects on biological factors (lipids, carotenoids, C-reactive protein [CRP]), cardiopulmonary 
fitness, meal satisfaction, and eating attitudes. As an exploratory aim, one-half of the 
participants assigned to the prepackaged entrée intervention were provided items with a 
higher protein level (>25% energy).

 Methods
Participants
Participants for this randomized controlled trial were recruited through word of mouth, 
direct marketing letters, local list serves, clinicaltrials.gov, social media, and flyers. 
Eligibility criteria included the following: aged 25-65 years; body mass index (BMI) 27-40 
kg/m2; not pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant in the next several 
months; willing to participate in any of the study diet arms over a 3-month period; no eating 
disorders, food allergies or intolerances; no history of bariatric surgery; willing and able to 
participate in clinic visits and study interactions at specified intervals and to maintain 
contact with the investigators for at least three months; willing to allow blood collections; 
and capable of performing a simple test for assessing cardiopulmonary fitness. Exclusion 
criteria were: inability to participate in physical activity because of comorbidity or disability 
(e.g., severe arthritic conditions); a history or presence of a comorbid disease for which diet 
modification and increased physical activity may be contraindicated or complicated; 
currently involved in another diet intervention study or organized weight loss program; and 
having a history or presence of a significant psychiatric disorder or any other condition that, 
in the investigator's judgment, would interfere with participation in the trial.
Participants were randomly assigned 3:3:2 to three groups: one in which the meal plan 
included any variety of the prepackaged entrées, one that offered only entrées with >25% 
energy from protein, or a meal plan based on self-selected foods (Figure 1). Randomization 
was stratified by age (<40 vs. ≥40 years) and BMI (27-32.9 vs. 33-40 kg/m2). The UCSD 
institutional review board approved the study protocol, and all participants provided written 
informed consent.
One hundred eighty-four subjects were randomized, and one subject was excluded post-
randomization because she discovered that she had been pregnant at the time of 
randomization, leaving an analysis sample of 183 subjects.
Interventions
All study participants met with a dietitian for an initial 1-2 hour personalized diet 
prescription and counseling session. Each was prescribed an energy-reduced diet at a deficit 
of 500-1500 kcal/day based on estimated energy expenditure and was encouraged to 
increase physical activity. Menus ranged from 1200 to 3000 kilocalories/day. All participants 
were provided sample meal plans and guidance for how to choose grocery and restaurant 
items that would achieve the meal plan to accommodate special occasions and other needs. 
The physical activity goal was an average of at least 60 minutes/day of purposeful exercise 
at a moderate level of intensity. Participants were also provided behavioral weight loss 
guidance and strategies via in-person, telephone or email contact on a weekly basis for three 
months and were provided relevant print material and resources. Behavioral strategies and 
approaches that were applied in this intervention included self-monitoring of weight, food 
intake and exercise; realistic goal-setting, using behavior-specific goals and a step-wise 
approach to promote self-efficacy; training and role-playing in problem-solving; relapse

 prevention; strategies to increase social support; and modifying problematic thoughts and 
attitudes about weight, food, and physical activity.
Participants were encouraged to use Web-based and smart phone programs and applications 
to monitor and guide their food choices and exercise to meet their specific 
recommendations. Materials that were provided included recipes, guidance for eating in 
various restaurants, digital videos, information about exercise equipment, and sources of 
online education and support.
Participants who were assigned to the portion-controlled prepackaged lunch and dinner 
frozen entrées (Lean Cuisine, Nestlé USA, Inc., Glendale, CA) were asked to select their 
choices from all 50 varieties, or if assigned to the higher protein group, from the 25 entrées 
that provided >25% of energy from protein, to be consumed 7 days/week. The meal plans 
specified additional servings across food groups (e.g., grains, vegetables, fruit, dairy foods, 
protein foods, oils), with the goal of achieving the myplate.gov nutrient composition and 
macronutrient distribution (45-65% energy from carbohydrate, 20-35% energy from fat, and 
10-35% energy from protein) (http://www.choosemyplate.gov/). The average entrée 
provided 281 kilocalories, 6.2 grams fat (19.8% energy), 40 grams carbohydrate (56.9% 
energy) and 16.3 grams protein (23.2% energy). The average higher protein entrée provided 
250 kilocalories, 5.6 grams fat (20% energy), 32 grams carbohydrate (51% energy) and 18.4 
grams protein (29.4% energy). The two entrées (lunch and dinner) provided 20-50% of total 
daily energy intake.
Participants assigned to the standard self-selected diet group were provided a similar dietary 
prescription and specifications but without the lunch and dinner entrées, so the participant 
self-selected all foods for those meals from the food groups and energy intake level 
prescribed. Participants in this group also had individualized face-to-face follow-up and brief 
counseling at two weeks and one month.
All participants were reimbursed $80 for data collection clinic visits. Participants assigned to 
the prepackaged entrées were provided their selected entrées free of charge on a weekly 
basis. The entrées were distributed from the clinic site, which allowed an assessment and 
reinforcement of compliance. Participants in the standard self-selected diet group were 
reimbursed $225 (as cash and gift cards) as an incentive and to cover some of the cost of 
their self-selected foods.
Measurements
Participants attended comprehensive data collection clinic visits at baseline and 3 months, 
when weight, waist circumference, height (baseline only), and blood pressure were 
measured; questionnaires were completed; fasting (>6 hours) blood samples were collected; 
and body composition measured. Body composition (fat and fat-free mass) was measured 
using a GE/Lunar Prodigy Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometer (DXA). Systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure was averaged from two sitting blood pressure measurements using 
an automated device. The 3-minute step test was used to assess aerobic fitness. This test 
measures heart rate during the first 30 seconds of recovery from stepping, and although less 
accurate than measuring maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), the test has high reliability and

 is sensitive to change (11). Brief clinic visits at 2- and 4-week follow-up visits were also 
conducted for additional weight measurements.
Measurements of cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-
C) were conducted with enzymatic methods using the Kodak Ektachem Analyzer system 
(Johnson & Johnson Clinical Diagnostics, Rochester, NY). Low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C) values were calculated using the Friedewald equation (12). High-
sensitivity CRP was assayed using the SPQ High Sensitive CRP Assay kit (DiaSorin, Inc., 
Stillwater, MN), a polystyrene-enhanced turbidimetric in vitro immunoassay (13). Plasma 
carotenoid concentrations, as a biomarker of vegetable and fruit intake, were measured by 
high-performance liquid chromatography (14). Accuracy and precision were monitored by 
the use of an in-house quality control pool and laboratory participation in the College of 
American Pathologists and the National Institute of Standards and Technology quality 
assurance programs.
Quality of life was assessed with the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire (15). 
The PANAS scale was used to assess positive and negative affect (16), along with a simple 
assessment of body image via a psychometric query that asks “how good do you think you 
look” on a scale of 1-10, as well as subjects' confidence that they “can control my eating and 
stick to a meal plan that will help me lose weight.” Participants also completed the three-
factor Eating Inventory, a 51-item questionnaire that assesses eating attitudes and behavior 
across three scales: dietary restraint, disinhibition, and hunger (17). Physical activity was 
estimated using the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire, which consists of three 
questions that record the frequency and duration of mild, moderate, and strenuous exercise 
performed during leisure time in a typical week. This is a validated self-report measure of 
physical activity that has been widely used in previous research (18). We report weekly 
hours of moderate and strenuous physical activity.
Statistical analysis
Demographic characteristics were summarized for the groups, and the study groups were 
compared at baseline with regard to key variables (e.g., weight, BMI, age, biochemical 
measures) using 2-sample tests. The main outcome measure was percent change in body 
weight at 12 weeks in the aggregated portion-controlled prepackaged food intervention arms 
vs. the control arm. Our recruitment of 184 participants was based on having >80% power to 
detect a mean expected difference in weight loss between the aggregated prepackaged food 
arms and the control group arm of 3.1% of initial weight (4.7% vs. 1.6%), based on previous 
studies, with a retention rate >90% as we have achieved in our prior weight loss studies 
within a 12-month time frame. Although we did not plan or anticipate having sufficient 
power to detect differences between the regular and higher protein prepackaged entrée 
subgroups, data from these two subgroups are presented to allow comparison of these data 
as an exploratory aim. Percent change from baseline weight was computed using data 
collected at the 2-week and 1-month weight visits and the full 3-month clinic visit. The 
aggregated intervention arms were compared with control subjects using t-tests. Paired t-
tests within study arms compared data from subjects at baseline and 3 months.

 Lipids, CRP, total carotenoids, blood pressure, physical activity, and step test heart rate were 
compared in the aggregated intervention arms vs. the control group using t-tests. Paired t-
tests within study arms compared change data from subjects between baseline and 3 months. 
CRP values were log transformed to improve normality in paired t-tests, and CRP was also 
analyzed with a nonparametric test.
Baseline psychosocial measures were compared to 3-month measures within each study 
group using paired t-tests, and 3-month measures were compared between aggregated 
portion-control prepackaged intervention and standard self-selected diet groups using two-
sample t-tests.
Significance was set at two-sided alpha = 0.05. Analyses were performed using SAS version 
9.4 (Cary, NC).
Results
Participants (58% female and 42% male) were aged 25-65 years, and almost one-half were 
members of a minority racial/ethnic group (Table 1). Participants had mean (SD) baseline 
weight of 95.9 (15.6) kg and BMI of 33.2 (3.5) kg/m2. Weight data at study end were 
available for 180 of the 183 subjects (98.4%). Among participants assigned to the 
intervention, self-reported compliance with the prescribed entrées was 100% at two weeks 
and was diminished only minimally to approximately 80% at study end. Episodic 
nonadherence was attributable to interruptions due to brief illness or travel and occasional 
special meals.
Weight loss at 12 weeks for the regular entrée, higher protein entrée and control groups was 
8.6 (3.9) (mean [SD]), 7.8 (5.1), and 6.0 (4.4)%, respectively (Table 2, Figure 2) (P<0.005, 
intervention vs. control). At 3 months, a greater proportion of intervention (74%) than 
control (53%) participants achieved a ≥5% loss (P<0.02). Men assigned to the intervention 
lost a mean (SD) of 9.7 (4.4)% of their baseline weight, compared with women assigned to 
the intervention who lost 7.0 (4.3)% (P<0.001). Waist circumference decreased in all groups 
(Table 2). Intervention participants lost an average of 5.7 (3.4) kg of body fat (15.1% of 
initial body fat) compared with a loss of 4.4 (3.3) kg body fat in controls (10.7% of their 
initial body fat), (P<0.03 for kg fat loss and P<0.01 for % fat loss), as shown in Table 2.
Blood samples from the 3-month clinic visits were available from 169 (92.4%) of 
participants. Total cholesterol decreased by a mean of 6 (25) mg/dL in intervention 
participants (P<0.01), as shown in Table 3. At 3 months, cholesterol and LDL-C were higher 
in controls than in intervention participants (P=0.04). Intervention subjects decreased 
triglycerides at 3 months by a mean of 15 mg/dL (P<0.001) while controls decreased 
triglycerides by 11 mg/dL (P=0.07), as shown in Table 3.
Group differences were not observed in CRP at baseline. However, CRP in all three groups 
was different at 3 months (P<0.03), and the control group was higher at 3 months than the 
aggregated prepackaged food groups (P=0.06, Wilcoxon two-sided rank sum test). 
Intervention subjects, but not control subjects, decreased their log transformed CRP between 
baseline and 3 months (P<0.03, paired t-test). In all groups, carotenoids increased from

 baseline to 3 months (P<0.01) but did not differ across groups at study end, indicating that 
vegetable and fruit consumption increased similarly in prepackaged and self-selected diet 
study groups.
Blood pressure and recovery heart rate decreased at 3 months in all study arms (P<0.01) 
(Table 3). Intervention participants had a greater decrease in step test recovery heart rate 
than control participants (P=0.03). Mean hours of weekly moderate/strenuous physical 
activity more than doubled in each of the study arms and did not differ in intervention and 
control participants.
Mental quality of life improved in intervention (P<0.01) but not in control subjects, as 
shown in Table 4. Meal satisfaction, as indicated by ratings of appearance and taste, did not 
change and was comparable in the portion-controlled prepackaged foods and standard self-
selected groups (Table 4). Subjects in all study groups reported decreases in hunger and 
disinhibition, and increases in restraint; they also gave themselves higher ratings for “I look 
good” at study end (Table 4). However, at 3 months control group participants expressed less 
confidence that they could control eating and stick to a meal plan for weight loss (P=0.03).
Discussion
Findings from this study suggest that prescribing portion-controlled prepackaged foods in 
the context of intensive behavioral weight loss counseling promotes a greater degree of 
weight and fat loss than a standard self-selected diet. We observed an average weight loss of 
∼8% of initial weight in participants prescribed twice-daily prepackaged entrées in their 
meal plans, compared to a weight loss of 6% in the control group prescribed a standard self-
selected diet. In association with a greater degree of weight loss, several cardiovascular 
disease risk factors (e.g., total cholesterol, LDL-C) also were lower in those assigned to the 
prepackaged foods compared to the control group at study end. Importantly, satisfaction with 
food and meals, which may be a critical factor that may determine long-term usefulness of 
this strategy, were comparable in those assigned to prepackaged entrées or a self-selected 
diet. The degree of weight reduction that was achieved has been shown to significantly 
reduce risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk factors in large randomized studies (2, 
19).
Compared to results from two previous 8-week studies of prescribing prepackaged entrées 
(9, 10), we observed somewhat greater weight loss in both intervention and standard self-
selected diet groups, likely attributable to the intensive behavioral weight loss counseling 
(which was not provided in those previous trials) as well as increased length of the 
intervention. Testing the effect of portion-controlled prepackaged foods within a 
comprehensive behavioral weight loss counseling intervention allows isolation of the 
specific effects of food provision. When examining outcomes of commercial weight loss 
programs that involve both behavioral counseling and the provision of portion-controlled 
prepackaged foods (20-22), it is difficult to disentangle the effects of providing prepackaged 
food from other aspects of the intervention. Also, the multifaceted intervention used in the 
present study increases the likelihood of sustained behavior change, because factors 
important for long-term weight control, such as exercise and social support, were addressed 
Rock et al.

 in addition to incorporating a portion control strategy. At study end, intervention group 
participants expressed more confidence that they could control eating and stick to a meal 
plan for weight loss, compared to those who were not prescribed the prepackaged entrées. 
Self-efficacy, an individual's confidence in his or her ability to carry out the behavior, is 
associated with better adoption of behavior change (23).
Incorporating food provision and structured meal plans into a behavioral weight loss 
intervention has been suggested to facilitate weight loss by reducing the complexity of 
planning and preparing reduced-energy food and meals (8). This strategy also affects the 
portion size effect as an approach to modifying energy intake. Possible mechanisms to 
explain the effect of portions on food consumption have recently been reviewed (24). These 
mechanisms include the response to the unit size (e.g., the observed tendency to eat whole 
units of food), providing a reference point that affects judgments about how much is 
appropriate to consume, and possibly, alterations in the meal microstructure (bite size, rate 
and frequency) (4, 24).
This was a relatively short-term study, but initial weight loss has been consistently found to 
predict long-term weight loss (5, 25, 26). Thus, these results are relevant to longer term 
success. In addition to improved mental QOL, participants who were prescribed 
prepackaged entrées reported meal and food satisfaction that was comparable to those eating 
self-selected foods. These findings suggest that monotony is not inevitable with portion-
controlled prepackaged foods and may be avoided with sufficient varieties of entrées, 
supporting long-term acceptability and usefulness of this strategy.
There are both strengths and limitations of this study. One strength is the nearly equal 
distribution of women and men in the study, and the large proportion of participants from 
minority racial/ethnic groups, which supports the applicability of the results to the general 
population. The low rate of drop-out, a recognized problem in the interpretation of results of 
many diet and weight loss studies, minimizes ambiguity in drawing inferences from this 
study.
An important limitation is the lack of detailed dietary intake data. Participants were 
encouraged to self-monitor dietary intake through tools and technology of their choice, but 
standardized dietary recalls or records were not conducted or analyzed. The sample was a 
free-living population, so variability in adherence is likely. Self-reported dietary data have 
well-recognized limitations in accuracy, which is characterized as substantial underreporting 
and misreporting especially among overweight and obese individuals. An implication of this 
limitation is that the relationship between adherence and response is not known. All study 
groups reported a substantial increase in physical activity, but more weight loss was 
observed in those assigned to prepackaged foods, suggesting better adherence with reduced 
energy intake in those participants. The behavioral intervention and prepackaged foods were 
provided without cost to the participants, as was also the case in Look AHEAD and in other 
weight loss and diet intervention studies (19-22, 26), which also may affect generalizability.
In conclusion, a meal plan incorporating portion-controlled prepackaged entrées promotes 
greater weight and fat loss than a standard self-selected diet in the context of an intensive

comparable meal satisfaction. Initial weight loss predicts long-term weight loss so these 
results are relevant to likelihood of longer term success.

 Study Importance Questions
What is already known about this subject?
What does this study add?
•
Providing liquid meal replacements or prepackaged foods is one portion 
control strategy that may promote more weight and fat loss than standard 
dietary and behavioral counseling. A comparison of prescribing 
commercially-available prepackaged foods to standard diet counseling in the 
context of behavioral weight loss counseling has not been previously 
conducted or reported.
•
Testing the effect of portion-controlled prepackaged foods within a 
comprehensive behavioral weight loss counseling intervention allows 
isolation of the specific effects of the food provision, which is not possible 
when examining outcomes in commercial weight loss programs that involve 
both behavioral counseling and the provision of portion-controlled 
prepackaged foods.
•
Findings from this study suggest that prescribing portion-controlled 
prepackaged foods in the context of intensive behavioral weight loss 
counseling promotes a greater degree of weight and fat loss compared to a 
standard self-selected diet, and improves cardiovascular disease risk markers, 
with comparable meal satisfaction.
