The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness and recovery times of 0.3
and 0.5 mg/kg intranasal midazolam (INM) administered with a mucosal atomizer
device (MAD) in a pediatric emergency dental hospital clinic. One hundred eighteen
children aged from 4 to 6 years were randomly administered either 0.3 or 0.5 mg/kg
INM via an MAD in a triple-blinded randomized controlled trial. Sedation was
achieved to some degree in 100% of the sample. The pulse rate and oxygen
saturation were within the normal range in 99% of the patients. A burning sensation
was reported in 9% of children. The recovery time of the 0.5 mg/kg group was
statistically longer than that of the 0.3 mg/kg group (16.5 vs 18.8 minutes) but the
difference was not clinically significant. The findings of this study show that 0.3 or
0.5 mg/kg doses of INM resulted in safe and effective sedation. The 0.5 mg/kg dose
was more effective than the 0.3 mg/kg dose in reducing anxiety.

ental extraction is an invasive procedure, especially
in young children at their precooperative stages.1
These children tend to be anxious, and sedation can be
useful to manage their anxiety such that the dental
treatment required by these children can be completed in
a less distressing manner.1 In South Africa, advanced
sedation techniques such as intravenous (IV) sedation
require the skill of anesthetists or medical doctors trained
in sedation, and they are a limited resource in Africa
generally.
Consequently, most of the children who present for
emergency extractions in the public service in South
Africa are not offered sedation because of the lack of
resources and may be inadvertently psychologically
traumatized. This traumatic experience may lead to
poor cooperation if dental treatment is subsequently
needed. This poor cooperation may result in the dental
practitioner having to resort to the use of dental general
anesthesia to complete the dental treatment required by
the child. Dental general anesthesia is more expensive
than sedation and is a limited resource that also carries
greater risks than sedation. There is a need for a
solution that will allow the operator-dentist to adminis-
ter a sedation technique that is safe and effective in
managing mildly to moderately anxious children in an
emergency dental setting so as to avoid exposing the
child to any unnecessary psychological trauma. The
types of conscious sedation that an operator-dentist is
allowed to administer in South Africa include oral
sedation (OS), inhalation sedation, and intranasal
sedation (INS).
Oral sedation (OS) is relatively inexpensive, is easy to
administer, and does not require the use of injections as
for IV sedation. It does not require the cooperation of
the child as for inhalation sedation.2 However, OS has a
longer duration of onset and longer recovery than the

 other routes of sedation and carries a risk of overseda-
tion because of the difficulty in determining the
appropriate dose.2 This risk of oversedation necessi-
tates the presence of an anesthetist in South Africa in
the event that cannulation is required to reverse the
effect of the drug. OS is not the ideal sedation technique
for a busy emergency clinic where time is of the
essence.
A technique that is gaining popularity for patients who
cannot cooperate with IV cannulation is intranasal
midazolam (INM).3 INM delivered via a mucosal atomizer
device (MAD) is rapidly absorbed through the nasal
mucosa into the systemic circulation.3 One major
advantage of INS is the fact that it has duration of onset
that is 3 times faster than that of OS.2 This is due to the
rapid absorption of the drug, which bypasses first-pass
hepatic portal metabolism.2 There is also a reduced risk
of the child spitting out the medication.2 Intranasal
sedation is increasingly being used by anesthetists in the
United States as a premedication prior to general
anesthesia.4
INS has not been recommended in the South
African Society of Anaesthesiologists pediatric seda-
tion guidelines because of the burning sensation and
bitter taste experienced by children during INM
administration.5 However, INM enables rapid onset
of sedation and provides the shortest recovery period
than any other route of sedation. INM may therefore
prove to be a viable route of sedation for pediatric
emergency dental extractions provided the burning
sensation and bitter taste can be substantially reduced
or eliminated.
Dentists and health care professionals who do not
have full medical doctor training are allowed to
administer single drugs for sedation via all routes except
the IV route provided that they have the appropriate
training in basic life support and/or pediatric advanced
life support.6,7 The use of a single drug to provide
moderate sedation provides a wide margin of safety5 so
as to deliver optimal treatment to a large number of
anxious children in a pediatric emergency dental
setting.
METHODS
Ethics
This study was conducted following approval by the
University of Western Cape Senate Research and Ethics
Committee. Parents were provided with written infor-
mation sheets informing them of the scope and nature of
the study and were required to provide written consent if
they agreed to allow their children to participate in this
study.
Study Sample
One hundred eighteen mildly to moderately anxious
children aged 4–6 years were randomly assigned into 2
groups,groupAandgroupB,toreceiveINSwith0.5mg/kg
and 0.3 mg/kg midazolam respectively. All these children
were healthy with a physical status classification of ASA I.
Children were not required to have fasted and were
monitored with a pulse oximeter throughout the
procedure.
Lidocaine 0.5% at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg was sprayed
into each nostril using an insulin syringe with an MAD
device. The lidocaine used for nasal anesthesia was
included in the local anesthetic (LA) toxicity dose
together with the lidocaine used prior to extractions.
The INM was administered into each nostril approx-
imately 3–4 minutes later with an MAD device.
Safety
Appropriate safety equipment including suction cathe-
ters, supplemental oxygen source and ability to deliver
positive pressure oxygen, oral and nasal airways,
appropriate intubation equipment, emergency drugs
and antagonists, vital signs monitors, and a defibrillator
was immediately available.
Examiner Reliability
A pilot study with a sample of 10 patients was conducted
to calibrate the examiners, and the proportion of
agreement between examiners was 70%.
This randomized controlled trial and triple-blinded
study involved 1 nurse who administered the INM, 1
dentist who performed the dental extractions, and 2
raters who recorded all data required.
Behavior and Anxiety Assessment
The level of sedation was assessed using the Wilson
sedation scale (Table 1). The level of anxiety and
behavior was rated using the Venham scale (Table 2).
The Facial Image Scale (Figure 1) was used to assess

 anxiety and mood of children before and after the
extractions.
Statistical Analysis
The data were entered into Microsoft Excel and analyzed
with the R program.
RESULTS
The mean body mass index of both groups was in a
range of 14–16 and did not influence the effectiveness of
either the 0.3 or the 0.5 mg/kg dose of INM (P ¼ .131).
Age and gender also did not affect the anxiety and
behavior of the children in this study.
Pulse Rate
The pulse rates of both the 0.3 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg
groups are illustrated in Figure 2. The final pulse rate was
significantly different between groups (P ¼ .029), with
mean values of 115 in group A and 108 in group B
respectively (Figure 2).
The oxygen saturation is also illustrated in Figure 2.
Only 1 child presented with an oxygen saturation of 90%
in the recovery stage, which was clinically significant
(Figure 2). The final oxygen saturation rate was not
significantly different (P ¼ .5), with mean values of 98.53
in group A and 98.69 in group B.
Sedation
The Wilson sedation scores revealed that 97% of
children in the study presented with a sedation scale
rating of 2 (patient drowsy) and only 4 children (3.4%)
displayed a sedation scale rating of 3 (patient’s eyes
closed but rousable to command).
Anxiety
The level of anxiety experienced during the administra-
tion of INS is illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. A comparison
of the anxiety levels between the 2 doses of INM
administered showed that they were not statistically
different.
Behavior Scores
Behavior scores during INS administration, LA, and
extractions for 0.3 and 0.5 mg/kg INM are illustrated
in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. The behavior scale
scores between the 2 doses revealed a significant
difference (P ¼ .04) during the administration of the
LA and when extractions were performed (P ¼ .03).
The higher dose of 0.5 mg/kg produced lower
behavior scale scores than the 0.3 mg/kg dose for
both the LA and extraction phases of treatment
(Figures 5 and 6).

The level of anxiety during INM is illustrated in Figure 7.
Time of Procedure
The times of the procedure from the administration of
the INM to the extraction(s) being performed were 35.21
and 36.45 minutes in the 0.3 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg
groups respectively. This was not statistically significant
(P ¼ .34).
Recovery Time
The recovery time recorded from the end of the
extraction procedure until the patient was discharged
was 16.5 minutes in the 0.3 mg/kg dose group and 18.8
minutes in the 0.5 mg/kg dose group.

 A small statistically significant difference exists be-
tween the 2 doses, as the Welch test produced a P value
of .04 but the Wilcoxon rank sum test revealed a P value
of .098.
A modified Aldrete discharge score was used to
assess discharge time. In addition to the standard
Aldrete scores, body temperature and pain were also
assessed. A score of 12 out of 12 was required in order
for the patient to be discharged, and the child was
assessed every 15 minutes until this score was
reached. A comparison between the 2 dose groups
was analyzed using the chi-square and Fisher exact
tests. The chi-square P value was .04 and the Fisher
exact P value was .03, making this comparison
statistically significant, with a higher proportion of
patients achieving a discharge score of 12 sooner in
the 0.3 mg/kg group.
Side Effects
The side effects experienced by patients due to the INS
are as follows: none, 42%; swallowed drug, 30%;
sneezing, 12%; burning sensation, 9%; coughing, 4%.
One child experienced a dull aching pain in the head for
a few minutes and 1 child presented with hiccups for a
few seconds.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study revealed that all children who
received either the 0.3 mg/kg or 0.5 mg/kg dose of
midazolam displayed some level of sedation, although
some children were less cooperative than others. Hence
the use of the 0.3 mg/kg or 0.5 mg/kg dose of
midazolam resulted in the safe and effective manage-

 ment of anxiety levels in children aged 4–6 years, as
evident from the results of anxiety and behavior levels.
The sedative effect of the 0.3 and 0.5 mg/kg doses of
midazolam effectively decreased the children’s levels of
anxiety and level of movement in order to allow for the
extractions to be performed successfully. Midazolam was
selected for use in the INS route because it provides
some degree of amnesia, it has a short duration of
action, and its sedative effect can be quickly and easily
reversed.8
The amnestic property of midazolam allows the child
to forget about the unpleasant experience so as to allow
future dental treatment to be a positive experience,
thereby allowing the child to achieve improved oral
health.9 We did not study amnesia, but amnesia is a
common effect of midazolam.8 Amnesia is preferable in
young children undergoing unpleasant procedures such
as dental extractions, as most extremely anxious children
experience psychological trauma in their first dental
appointment.8,10
The level of sedation among children varied after INS
administration. The reason for this variation could be the
midazolam solution’s either being swallowed or being
expelled during sneezing after INS administration. It is
possible that the bioavailability of the drug decreased
during swallowing and sneezing and thus resulted in
different onset times being recorded. The quick onset
and rapid effectiveness of INM were due to the rapid
absorption of the INM as it bypasses the hepatic portal
circulation with rapid nasal mucosal absorption and
probable absorption through the cribriform plate to the
brain and cerebrospinal fluid.2 INS allows for the highest
bioavailability of the drug after the IV route. INS results in
a quick onset of sedation and quick recovery more similar
to IV sedation than to OS. This makes INS a preferred
sedation technique for use in an emergency setting.11
The lowest levels of anxiety (85%) and improved
behavior (81%) were detected prior to LA and extrac-
tions, whereas the highest levels of anxiety and undesired
behavior were detected during INS, LA, and extractions.
The high levels of anxiety were probably due to the
discomfort of the INM during the administration; the pain
experienced during the LA injections, specifically the
palatal injections; and the pressure experienced during
the extraction procedure. Also, Salem et al10 reported
that a previous painful experience such as an LA
injection creates a negative memory associated with fear
and psychological trauma, and this experience could
possibly exacerbate pain sensations.
A higher percentage of children (22%) achieved a
relaxed and calm state and cooperated well during all
stages of treatment with the 0.5 mg/kg dose, whereas
only 9% of children achieved a relaxed and calm state
with the 0.3 mg/kg dose of INM. This confirms that the
0.5 mg/kg dose produced greater anxiolysis than the 0.3

 mg/kg dose. The duration of the treatment between the
2 groups is comparable to those of similar studies.11,12
The recovery time recorded for the children who were
administered the 0.5 mg/kg dose was statistically
significantly longer, with a difference of 2.3 minutes
(16.5 vs 18.8 minutes, P ¼.03) in comparison to the 0.3
mg/kg dose. This, however, was not considered as being
clinically significant, as the difference of a few minutes
with the 0.5 mg/kg dose did not slow the flow of patients
in the emergency clinic. In light of the fact that the 0.5
mg/kg dose resulted in a decreased level of anxiety and
better behavior scores than the 0.3 mg/kg dose, it can
be considered as being the more suitable dose in a
pediatric emergency dental clinic.
Safety
Safety is the primary goal in sedation, and the use of a
pulse oximeter is compulsory to monitor the pulse rate
and oxygen saturation.6 The pulse rates of the children
in this study were monitored throughout the procedure
and charted before and after sedation, with both dose
groups being within the normal range.
The mean pulse rate was lower in the 0.5 mg/kg
group (108) in comparison to the 0.3 mg/kg group
(115). However, the mean values of pulse rates of both
groups were within a normal range for children aged 4–6
years.13 The pulse-oximeter readings revealed oxygen
saturation levels above 95% at baseline and after
treatment. Only 1 child desaturated briefly for 3 minutes
with an oxygen saturation value of 90% and presented
with snoring. The initial management of this event of
desaturation was to stimulate and rouse the child in order
to increase the muscle tone and prompt breathing.6 This
maneuver normalized the oxygen saturation immediately
to above 95%. There were no cases that required
respiratory support or emergency intervention. Howev-
er, in the event that emergency intervention is required,
the majority of sedation complications can be managed
with simple maneuvers, such as supplemental oxygen,
opening the airway, suctioning, and bag-mask-valve
ventilation.6
It is mandatory for operator-sedationists using INS
to have the appropriate basic life support or pediatric
advanced life support certification in order to provide
the appropriate resuscitation intervention if re-
quired.5 Operator-sedationists in emergency dental
clinics can safely and effectively administer single-
drug INS for children between the ages of 4 and 6
years, particularly if this type of sedation is adminis-
tered in a hospital setting.6 Furthermore, it is
compulsory that the sedated patient’s pulse rate and
oxygen
saturation
are
monitored
with
a
pulse
oximeter and all appropriate resources are available
for patient recovery.6
In the event that an adverse event occurs and reversal
of INM is required, the benzodiazepine antagonist
flumazenil is recommended.14 Although flumazenil is
currently registered for use as an IV preparation,15 it
may also be utilized as an intranasal preparation via an
MAD at a recommended dose regimen of 40 lg �
kg�1.14 Scheepers et al14 reported that the mean
plasma concentrations of flumazenil administered via a
syringe intranasally were similar to plasma concentra-
tions of flumazenil administered IV. This dose regimen
was also used by Heard et al,16 who administered 1 mL
(100 mcg � mL�1) per opening of the nares to effectively
reverse the effect of midazolam. The patients in the
study by Heard et al16 were then required to be
observed for at least a 2-hour period following the
administration of intranasal flumazenil in order to
observe for any episodes of resedation. A 2-hour period
of observation is recommended following the adminis-
tration of intranasal flumazenil.16 The use of intranasal
flumazenil allows for delivery of the benzodiazepine
antagonist in a quick and easy manner resulting in a
successful outcome.14,16 The intranasal form of fluma-
zenil can be administered by the operator-sedationist.
The use of intranasal flumazenil will, however, be
dependent on regulations governing the use of intrana-
sal flumazenil in each specific country. Irritation of the
nasal mucosa is possible.
Although there are some published reports on the
effective use of intranasal flumazenil, more research is
required before this technique can be recommended
without reservation.
Preoperative fasting cannot be planned in emergency
medical and dental settings.6 In order to ensure the
safety of those who are unable to fast, a balance is
required between depth of sedation and the possible
risk.6 Sedation that does not require the child to fast is
appropriate for these types of settings.6 The guidelines
of countries might differ on fasting requirements for
INS, and it is imperative that the appropriate guidelines
be followed for the region in which the dentist practices.
In this study there was minimal risk of aspiration, as the
children’s protective reflexes were maintained through-
out the treatment as moderate sedation was the
achieved level of sedation in all participants. This level
of sedation was acceptable to carry out the treatment
required based on our ability to complete treatment on
all patients with reasonable behavior. The INS, with
doses of 0.3 and 0.5 mg/kg midazolam, is a suitable
technique for use in an emergency medical or dental
hospital setting.

 Side Effects
The only drawback of the administration of INS is that a
burning sensation of the nasal mucosa has been reported
in children.2 Midazolam is an anxiolytic but does not
have analgesic properties, so LA to anesthetize the nasal
mucosa prior to INS is beneficial. Chiaretti et al17
conducted a study using INS with midazolam with prior
administration of an LA spray (lidocaine) in order to
anesthetize the nasal mucosa prior to INM administration
and reported that there was no burning sensation
experienced in 100% of their sample. This motivated
the researchers in this study to include an LA (lidocaine)
to anesthetize the nasal mucosa prior to INS in order to
avoid the unpleasant burning sensation. According to the
findings by Wood,11 43% of children experienced a
burning sensation, in comparison to 9% in this study.
The lidocaine used in the study by Wood11 was given
with the midazolam, as opposed to this study, where
lidocaine was given 3–4 minutes prior to INS so as to
anesthetize the nasal mucosa and avoid the burning
sensation. The low concentration of midazolam (5 mg/
mL) used in this study results in a larger volume, which
inadvertently passes through the oropharynx and makes
contact with the tongue, causing the bitter taste.11 The
concentrated formulation of 4 g/mL used in the study by
Wood11 effectively decreased the likelihood of midazo-
lam being swallowed through the nasopharynx and
resulted in 57% acceptability, in comparison to the
35% acceptability of INM in this study. Hence, a
concentrated dose of midazolam such as 25 mg/mL or
40 mg/mL with lidocaine may avoid the burning
sensation and bitter taste produced with the INM. It
may also preferable to use a more concentrated 10 mg/
mL lidocaine rather than the 5 mg/mL prior to INS to
avoid the experience of a burning sensation.
Limitations of the Study
A control group was not included in this study, and
therefore the researchers could not assess how many
children would have displayed minimal or no anxiety
without INS.
The use of the diluted dose of 5 mg/mL INM may
have decreased the effectiveness of the midazolam, as
more may have been swallowed rather than absorbed
through the nasal mucosa than had a higher concentra-
tion/lower volume been used. The use of a low
concentration of 0.2 mg/kg intranasal lidocaine may
have also contributed to 9% of children experiencing a
burning nasal sensation that was not associated with
INM.
CONCLUSION
The operator-sedationist model using INS with 0.3 mg/
kg or 0.5 mg/kg midazolam resulted in safe and effective
anxiolysis for emergency dental extractions in children
between 4 and 6 years old who did not fast. The 0.5 mg/
kg dose was more effective than the 0.3 mg/kg dose in
reducing anxiety and improving the child’s behavior. The
recovery time of the 0.5 mg/kg dose was slightly more
than that for the 0.3 mg/kg dose, but this did not impede
the patient flow in the pediatric emergency dental clinic
and is recommended for use in emergency medical and
dental hospital settings.
