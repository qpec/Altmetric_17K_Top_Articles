Understanding the dynamics of Zika virus transmission and formulating rational strategies for its control require
precise diagnostic tools that are also appropriate for resource-poor environments. We have developed a rapid
and sensitive loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay that distinguishes Zika viruses of Asian and Af-
rican lineages. The assay does not detect chikungunya virus or flaviviruses such as dengue, yellow fever, or West Nile
viruses. The assay conditions allowed direct detection of Zika virus RNA in cultured infected cells; in mosquitoes; in
virus-spiked samples of human blood, plasma, saliva, urine, and semen; and in infected patient serum, plasma, and
semen samples without the need for RNA isolation or reverse transcription. The assay offers rapid, specific, sensitive,
and inexpensive detection of the Asian-lineage Zika virus strain that is currently circulating in the Western hemi-
sphere, and can also detect the African-lineage Zika virus strain using separate, specific primers.
INTRODUCTION
Asian-lineage Zika viruses have established mosquito-borne trans-
mission in North, South, and Central America and in the Cape Verde
Islands and are poised to enter Africa (1–5). The spread of Zika virus
underscores the need for rapid and inexpensive Zika-specific diagnos-
tic assays for surveillance and health care. Zika virus infection may be
asymptomatic or cause fever, rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis last-
ing several days. Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults and microcephaly
in newborns have been associated with Asian-lineage Zika virus in-
fection (6–9). Zika viruses are primarily transmitted by Aedes spp.
mosquitoes but can be directly transmitted through sexual contact
and from mother to fetus (2–4, 10–14). The impending overlap of
Asian- and African-lineage viruses requires their precise identifica-
tion. Zika viruses circulate with other arboviruses in the Americas,
specifically dengue viruses (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and
chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and patients infected with Zika virus,
DENV, or CHIKV exhibit similar symptoms. Current diagnostic tests
for these viruses include viral RNA detection by reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), post-exposure serology, and
virus isolation (1, 3).
Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a rapid, sim-
ple, and sensitive nucleic acid amplification assay (15). It uses Bst
DNA polymerase, which has reverse transcriptase activity and ampli-
fies specific DNAs without temperature cycling (16). Results can be
determined by a variety of methods including turbidity, color change,
or fluorescence detection and can be confirmed by amplicon restric-
tion digestion, PCR, or sequencing. RT-LAMP is used to detect viral
RNAs after RNA purification and inclusion of reverse transcriptase in
the LAMP reaction. Specific RT-LAMP protocols for arboviruses have
been deployed successfully in endemic countries (17–24).
We have developed a Zika virus LAMP assay that uses the reverse
transcriptase activity of Bst DNA polymerase for direct detection of
viral RNA in mosquito homogenates and human biofluids without
previous RNA isolation. The assay provides clade-specific detection
of Zika virus RNAs. Visual readouts were assessed immediately, and
samples were retained for further analysis. The assay distinguished
Asian- and African-lineage Zika viruses from other arthropod-borne
viruses and from each other using specific primer sets. Sensitivity was
comparable to quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) but without the need
for RNA isolation or reverse transcription.
RESULTS
The LAMP assay specifically amplifies RNA from
Asian- or African-lineage Zika viruses
We designed Zika virus LAMP primers to a unique genome region of
the Puerto Rican Zika strain, PRVABC59 [3500 to 5300 nucleotides
(nt)] via the LAMP software PrimerExplorer V4 (15). Of the five primer
sets, a single set of four primers between positions 3694 and 3978 in
the NS2A coding region was chosen for further work (Fig. 1A and
table S1). We infected Vero cells with the PRVABC59 Zika virus strain
and amplified the target sequence from purified cellular RNA with-
out previous reverse transcription or inclusion of reverse transcrip-
tase in the reaction (Fig. 1B and Table 1). We confirmed the target
sequence by restriction fragment analysis and PCR of the LAMP

 product with the LAMP primers (fig. S1, A and B) and by direct
sequence analysis of both the LAMP and PCR amplicons, which
matched the target PRVABC59 sequence (Fig. 1A). Ribonuclease
(RNase) A treatment abrogated signal from PRVABC59-infected
Vero cell RNA (fig. S1C).
Total RNA from Vero cells infected under identical conditions with
the P6-740 Malaysian, MR-766NIID Ugandan, or 41525 Senegalese
strains of Zika virus were also tested for amplification. P6-740 RNA
was amplified with the PRVABC59 primer set, but there was no
amplification from total RNA from cells infected with the Senegalese
or Ugandan viruses (Fig. 1B and Table 1). All four Zika virus RNA
preparations could be amplified by conventional RT-PCR with Zika-
specific primers (fig. S2A and Table 1). The PRVABC59 LAMP prim-
ers closely match sequences from 64 Zika virus strains within the
Asian clade, but the 19 sequences in the African clade have a mini-
mum of 17 base changes across the primer target sequences (fig. S3, A
and B). Most base changes within the Asian clade are in strains from
Southeast Asia and Micronesia. The 1966 Malaysian sequence P6-740
is most divergent, with five base changes, yet P6-740 was readily am-
plified with the PRVABC59 Zika virus LAMP primers (Fig. 1B).
Among the American isolates, a sequence from Panama has two base
changes, and nine others have single base changes across all primer
target sequences (a total of six distinct base changes). Four of these
do not alter the amino acid sequence. Primer target sequences in 47
of the Asian-lineage Zika viruses are identical to the PRVABC59
strain sequence.
To detect the African-lineage Zika viruses in an identical LAMP
assay, we modified the primer sequences to match the MR-766NIID
Ugandan prototype strain (fig. S3, A and B) and retested the MR-
766NIID, 41525, P6-740, and PRVABC59 RNAs for amplification.
LAMP amplification with these primers was limited to the two Af-
rican strains, MR-766NIID and 41525 (Fig. 1C and Table 1).
We tested the PRVABC59 Zika virus LAMP primer set against
RNAs from Bussuquara virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, Langat
virus, Powassan virus, Ilheus virus, DENV-2, West Nile virus (WNV),
YFV, and CHIKV. All were negative for amplification with the Asian-
lineage Zika virus primers (Table 1). All tested flavivirus RNAs were pos-
itive by RT-PCR with pan-flavivirus primers (25), and CHIKV RNA was
positive with CHIKV-specific primers (fig. S2, B and C, and Table 1).
We were able to amplify DENV-2, WNV, and YFV RNAs with pre-
viously described RT-LAMP primers (17, 20, 24) using our amplifica-
tion protocol without reverse transcription (fig. S2D and Table 1).
The DENV-2, WNV, and YFV RT-LAMP primers did not amplify
PRVABC59 Zika virus RNA.

 Zika virus RNA can be detected in infected mosquitoes
with the LAMP assay
We detected the PRVABC59 Zika virus strain in infected C6/36 mos-
quito cells using the PRVABC59 LAMP primers (Table 2). To test
direct amplification of virus RNA, we lysed infected and mock-infected
Vero cells and C6/36 cells in water and used 2 ml of lysate (equivalent to
1000 cells) for amplification. Lysis in water allowed amplification of
Zika virus RNA without further processing (Fig. 2A and Table 2). Viral
RNA in infected Vero cell supernatant was also directly amplified
(Fig. 2B). Tenfold dilution of supernatant in water decreased the time
to detection from 36 to 26 min, indicating an increase in the efficiency
of the reaction with dilution of the cell culture medium.
We carried out oral infections of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with
cell-free PRVABC59 Zika virus. At 7 days after infection, whole mos-
quitoes were homogenized in mosquito diluent for plaque assays and
2.5 ml (1/100th) of homogenates from 15 infected and 3 mock-infected
mosquitoes were directly amplified. All 15 infected mosquito homog-
enates were positive, and the 3 mock-infected mosquito homogenates
were negative (fig. S4 and Table 2). Plaque assays detected infectious
virus in 14 of the 15 homogenates (Table 2). A representative mosquito-
LAMP product was subjected to restriction digestion, PCR, and se-
quencing; the predicted PCR product and restriction fragments were
observed (fig. S5, A and B), and the sequence was confirmed. RNase
A–treated homogenates were negative for amplification (fig. S6A),
and deoxyribonuclease (DNase) I digestion only reduced the time
to amplification from 40 min (±2.1 min SE) to 34 min (±1.4 min SE)
(fig. S6B).
Ten additional infected mosquito homogenates and homogenates
of dissected salivary glands, midguts, and carcasses from five infected
mosquitoes were tested at 14 days after infection. We made sagittal
sections of the mosquitoes and homogenized half in mosquito diluent
with serum for plaque and LAMP assays and half in water for the
LAMP assay alone. We detected viral RNA in all 10 virus-infected
homogenates, but the average time to detect positive LAMP signal
with mosquito diluent was 60.5 min (±9.4 min SE) versus 33.9 min
in water (±4.3 min SE) (Fig. 3). A sample from a single homogenate with
low virus titer corresponded to delayed time to detection (Table 2).
Dissected tissues were all collected in mosquito diluent. Viral RNA
was detected in four of five midguts, four of five salivary glands, and
one of five mosquito carcasses (Table 2). Plaque assays matched results

 for one of four positive midguts and two of four positive salivary glands,
but not the single carcass (table S3).
Other investigators have established methods for LAMP product
detection by color change or turbidity (26, 27), and these methods have
been implemented for the detection of arbovirus RNAs (17–24). We am-
plified mock and PRVABC59 strain–infected mosquito homogenates with-
out RNA isolation or reverse transcription in a simple heat block and
distinguished positive samples by visible turbidity after 1 hour (fig. S7).
We have determined that the basic requirement for LAMP am-
plification of Zika virus RNA is the lysis of infected cells. Homogeni-
zation of mosquitoes in water instead of mosquito diluent with serum
reduced the time to detection. Reduced viral loads also correlated with
extended time to detection. With or without serum or host DNA, the
detection of Zika virus RNA in infected mosquitoes using the LAMP
assay does not require RNA isolation or reverse transcription.
The limit of detection of RNA from the PRVABC59 Zika virus
strain by the LAMP assay is comparable to qRT-PCR
We assayed 10-fold dilutions of the total RNA from PRVABC59-infected
Vero cells by the LAMP assay and by conventional RT-PCR. Gel analy-
ses of LAMP and RT-PCR products are shown in fig. S8. Both
methods detected PRVABC59 RNA equivalent to 100 fg of total
infected cell RNA.
We compared direct detection of virus in cell supernatants between
the LAMP assay and a standard qRT-PCR assay for Zika virus detection
(28). Tenfold dilutions of PRVABC59-infected Vero cell supernatants
[6.4 × 106 plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml)] were prepared in water,
and 2 ml from each dilution was amplified by both assays (n = 6 repli-
cates). Additional twofold dilutions around the end point were prepared
and assayed to better delineate the limit of detection (LOD) for each as-
say. The Zika virus LAMP assay LOD was 0.43 PFU, and the LOD for
qRT-PCR was 0.17 PFU. Confidence intervals (CIs) and PFU/ml equiva-
lents are reported in Table 3. Representative results of LAMP assays of
serial dilutions of Vero cell supernatants are presented in Fig. 4A.
For direct, quantitative comparison of the LAMP and qRT-PCR as-
says, we constructed a complementary DNA (cDNA) clone of the full-
length PRVABC59 Zika virus genome and transcribed genomic RNA in
vitro. Genome equivalents were determined by molecular weight, and
10-fold dilutions were measured with both assays. Twofold dilutions at
the end point were performed to determine the LOD for each assay (n ≥
6 replicates) (Table 3). The Zika virus LAMP assay LOD was 111 genome
copies (table S4A), and the qRT-PCR LOD was 53 genome copies (table
S4B). Representative results of LAMP assays of serial dilutions of in vitro
transcribed virus RNA are presented in Fig. 4B.
Detection limits for RNA from infected cells were comparable be-
tween LAMP and conventional RT-PCR assays. We also demon-
strated the direct detection of virus RNA, without RNA isolation,
from virus supernatants using both the LAMP assay and qRT-PCR
at comparable levels. The 95% CI for the LOD with the LAMP assay
lies entirely within the 95% CI for qRT-PCR. Similarly, there was a
large overlap between the higher bounds of the 95% CI for detection
of genome equivalents by qRT-PCR and the lower bounds of the 95%
CI by the LAMP assay (Table 3). We did not conduct a formal sta-
tistical test of differences in mean LOD.
The LAMP assay detects PRVABC59 Zika virus strain
RNA in virus-spiked samples of human blood, plasma,
saliva, urine, and semen
We tested direct detection of Zika virus in human samples of blood,
plasma, saliva, urine, and semen. Aliquots of each fluid were inoculated

 with PRVABC59 Zika virus from infected Vero cell supernatants at a
final concentration of 106 PFU/ml. Tenfold dilutions of each biofluid
were prepared in water, and 2 ml (undiluted, 2000 PFU) was amplified.
Fluorescent dye incorporation was very low in undiluted biofluids (fig.
S9, blue circles). A 1:100 dilution (20 PFUs) in water was necessary for
adequate amplification. A 1:1000 dilution yielded full fluorescent dye
incorporation. Biofluids without added virus were negative.
To quantify the limits of detection for each spiked biofluid, we first
prepared 10-fold dilutions of the biofluid, then further diluted each
dilution in water, and amplified 2 ml (n ≥ 6). Twofold serial dilutions
of biofluid followed by dilution in water were assayed at the LOD. Dilu-
tions of plasma with virus were assayed at final 1:100 and 1:1000 dilutions
in water, and the LOD was 0.28 and 0.05 PFU, respectively (Table 3
and table S5A). Representative results of LAMP assays of serial dilu-
tions are presented in Fig. 5. Matched amplifications of the 1:1000
plasma dilutions were also incubated in a heat block followed by visual
assessment of turbidity, and the LOD was 0.17 PFU (table S5B). Rep-
resentative results of the turbidity assays of plasma dilutions are
presented in Fig. 5B. Limits of detection of other biofluids were de-
termined at 1:1000 final dilution in water. The LOD was 0.05 PFU in
whole blood, 0.32 PFU in urine, 0.13 PFU in saliva, and 5.57 PFU in
semen (Table 3 and tables S6 to S9). Representative results of LAMP
assays of the serial dilutions of these virus-spiked biofluids are presented
in Fig. 5C.
We detected Zika virus directly in biofluids with varying degrees
of sensitivity. On the basis of the values at upper CIs, detection of
Zika virus in plasma and blood was <2.1 × 102 and 1.26 × 102 PFU/ml,
respectively. Detection was less than 1.63 × 103 PFU/ml in urine, 4.28 ×
103 PFU/ml in saliva, and 3.04 × 105 PFU/ml in semen. Quantitative
detection required 1000-fold dilution in water for efficient LAMP
amplification.
Zika virus RNA can be detected in plasma, serum, and semen
samples from infected patients
We next tested Zika virus–positive and Zika virus–negative human
plasma and serum samples from cohorts of infected patients in Brazil
and Nicaragua, respectively, as well as Zika virus RNA–positive human
semen samples. All samples were previously tested by qRT-PCR for the
presence or absence of Zika virus RNA at the respective points of care.
The plasma and serum samples were coded before receipt so that the
LAMP assay was conducted in a blinded manner. We assayed 32 serum
samples, collected from patients in Managua, Nicaragua, which were
thawed and diluted 1:100 in water for direct LAMP amplification of
2.5 ml in quadruplicate. We called the samples positive based on one
or more positive replicates with a defined product melting point; of
the 32 samples, we identified 22 that were positive (Table 4 and table
S10). Upon decoding, the original qRT-PCR results had identified 20
Zika virus–positive samples of the 32 serum samples. Of the 22 pos-
itive samples identified by the LAMP assay, 18 matched the original

 qRT-PCR results (90%) and 4 were false positives. Of the 10 LAMP
assay–negative samples, 8 matched known negatives (67%) and 2 were
false negatives. Assays of samples diluted to 1:10 returned 28 positives,
and dilution to 1:500 returned 14 positive samples.
To compare qRT-PCR and LAMP amplification of the samples di-
rectly, we isolated RNA from 20 ml of each serum sample and used equal
volumes of these RNA preparations in both assays, before decoding the
original results (Table 4 and table S10). Of the 20 known positives, qRT-
PCR and the LAMP assay both identified 19 of the positive samples
(95%). RT-PCR yielded one false negative, whereas the LAMP assay
yielded identification of one false negative and one false positive. We de-
tected one positive sample with the LAMP assay that was missed by qRT-
PCR (table S10), and qRT-PCR missed one positive sample that was
missed by the LAMP assay.
We detected Zika virus RNA directly, without RNA isolation, in
serum samples from infected individuals; the success and accuracy of
direct detection were dependent on the dilution factor in water. LAMP
amplification of Zika virus RNA from purified RNA preparations was
comparable in error rate to qRT-PCR using the same RNAs but with-
out the need for reverse transcription.
We also assayed 49 plasma samples collected from patients in Re-
cife, Brazil. It should be noted that these samples had been previously
thawed and refrozen. These samples were thawed and diluted 1:100 in
water for direct LAMP amplification of 2.5 ml in quadruplicate. We
called the samples based on one or more positive replicates with a de-
fined product melting point and then decoded them to compare with
previous results using qRT-PCR and serology (Table 5 and table S11).
Of the 49 plasma samples in the cohort, 25 were previously identified
as Zika virus–positive and 24 as Zika virus–negative by qRT-PCR. Six
of the RT-PCR–negative samples were subsequently identified as pos-
itive by serology [using anti–Zika virus immunoglobulin M (IgM)] for
a total of 31 antibody-positive and RT-PCR–positive plasma samples
and 18 negative samples. Direct LAMP assay identified 33 positive and
16 negative samples. Twenty-one of the positive samples matched known
positives (68%) and 12 were false positives. Of the 16 LAMP-negative
samples, 6 matched known negative samples (33%) and 10 were false
negatives.
In addition to the plasma samples, a subset of 26 stored RNA sam-
ples, originally assayed by qRT-PCR, was available for LAMP assay.
Three of the 26 had been negative by qRT-PCR (Table 5 and table
S11). Eighteen of the 26 RNAs were positive by the LAMP assay. Sixteen
of the positive samples matched known positives (70%) and 2 were false
positives. Of the eight LAMP-negative RNAs, one matched a known neg-
ative sample and seven were false negatives. Combined results from direct
LAMP amplification of plasma samples and amplification of matching,
stored RNAs yielded positive results for 26 of the 31 positive samples
(84%) with 12 false positives and 6 false negatives.
An overview of the data indicates the presence of false-positive and
false-negative results in the direct amplification of human plasma and
serum samples when compared to previous data from qRT-PCR. The
available RNA preparations from these samples were predominantly
Zika virus–positive samples, which limited the assessment of false-
positive results from RNA samples. We were unable to produce new RNA
preparations from these samples for direct comparison of qRT-PCR
and LAMP amplification.
In addition to the serum and plasma samples, we tested five known
Zika virus RNA–positive semen samples from male U.S. travelers who
were confirmed to be infected with Zika virus either serologically or by
qRT-PCR from a sample of body fluid (serum, whole blood, or urine).
The results of direct LAMP amplification of 1:100 dilutions of the se-
men samples yielded three of five positive samples (Table 6). The re-
maining two samples, which had comparable amounts of Zika virus
RNA based on qRT-PCR of isolated RNAs, exhibited an unusual
linear fluorescent dye incorporation that suggested excess DNA con-
tamination. We digested all five samples with DNase I and were then
able to directly detect Zika virus RNA in all five samples. These results
suggest the need for DNase I digestion to directly detect viral RNA in
semen samples.

 DISCUSSION
The Zika virus outbreak in the Americas resulted from the recent in-
troduction of Asian-lineage strains into the Western hemisphere via
Southeast Asia and Micronesia (29, 30). Their spread in a large and
naïve population produced a full spectrum of disease in adults and
birth defects in developing fetuses. Whether the Asian strains have
acquired greater virulence or more efficient transmission is not known,
but significant sequence variation from African strains is apparent. Such
variation has made the specific detection of Asian versus African Zika
viruses possible. Asian-lineage Zika viruses have now spread to the Cape
Verde Islands (31) and are anticipated to enter Africa with uncertain
outcomes in terms of human health. The ability to distinguish Asian
and African Zika viruses will make it possible to better understand these
outcomes. The need for rapid and inexpensive detection of the Asian-
lineage Zika viruses in the Americas is already clear. The distinction of
Asian and African Zika viruses may also become critical.
The PRVABC59 Zika virus strain was isolated in the United States
in 2015 from a patient who had traveled to Puerto Rico. Phylogenetic
analyses place it in the Asian clade with the prototype Malaysian strain
P6-740 (30), which we detected by LAMP assay with the PRVABC59
primers. The sequence of P6-740 is the most distant from other mem-
bers of the clade, and sequences of American isolates are very similar
in comparison, so, while not certain, it is highly likely that the PRVABC59
primers would hybridize to all Zika virus RNA sequences in this clade.
The African strains we tested, the Ugandan and Senegalese isolates,
were not amplified, but we modified the primer sequences to match
the prototype Ugandan strain and established an African clade–specific
assay. The stringency of the assay precludes detection of other flavi-
viruses and CHIKV, which circulate in the Western hemisphere, and
allows specific detection of Zika virus isolates of the Asian or African
lineage.
The LAMP assay we describe will be valuable for vector surveillance.
We were able to detect Zika virus RNA in single mosquitoes without
RNA extraction. The lowest virus load detected, 8.4 × 103 PFU/ml, is com-
parable to the lowest virus load observed in Zika virus–infected A. aegypti
(32), which ranges from 104 to 106 PFU/ml through the course of in-
fection. This sensitivity is sufficient to detect a single infected mosquito
in a collection pool of 50 noninfected mosquitoes. Equipment require-
ments have been reduced to fluid handling and single-temperature
heat blocks that can be run on batteries. Rapid field tests of individual
mosquitoes in addition to pools of mosquitoes will provide an assess-
ment of virus load within the vector population. Additionally, on-site
identification of infected mosquitoes will permit highly focused con-
trol efforts. The field assay will increase efficiency and reduce overall
cost, allowing an increase in the extent of surveillance in resource-
limited regions.
Under controlled conditions with known quantities of cultured
virus inoculated into human samples of blood, plasma, urine, saliva,
and semen, dilution in water permitted efficient detection of Zika virus
RNA (fig. S9 and Table 4). Detection of less than 210 PFU/ml in plas-
ma should be sensitive enough to detect virus during acute infection,
when titers in blood range from 102 to 106 PFU/ml (28, 33–35). Direct
detection was less sensitive in control preparations of whole blood,
urine saliva, and semen. These types of samples will require addi-
tional approaches to reach adequate sensitivity in the direct assay.
Mucolytic treatment of semen with dithiothreitol and DNase is an
example of a simple modification that yielded consistent amplification
of viral RNAs.
Assays of clinical samples present challenges to the direct detection
of Zika virus RNA by the LAMP assay. No assay can account for virus
instability in biofluids, especially in late acute or convalescent patients
with rising antibody titers and declining viremia, but the requirement
for 100-fold sample dilution limits the sensitivity of the direct LAMP
assay. This dilution factor is not necessary for LAMP amplification from
purified RNA. Successful detection by the LAMP assay or by RT-PCR is
also subject to sample storage conditions, especially the numbers of
freeze-thaw cycles of plasma or serum. This was a particular issue with
the tested plasma samples, and yet, the direct LAMP assay identified five
seropositive samples that had gone undetected by qRT-PCR. Realisti-
cally, the detection of viruses in human clinical samples will continue
to require RNA isolation to achieve maximum sensitivity and accuracy.
When matched RNA preparations were used, the LAMP assay without
reverse transcription matched RT-PCR with respect to specificity and
levels of detection near a theoretical limit of single virus genome copies.
In the near term, the LAMP assay will offer a rapid and inexpensive con-
firmatory assay for Zika virus RNA from human clinical samples.
The LAMP assay is limited as a quantitative assay: End point dilu-
tions with appropriate standards are required for full quantitation be-
cause the relationship between time to positivity and target concentration
is not linear. As with RT-PCR, the extreme sensitivity of the LAMP
assay requires careful control of sample and assay preparation facilities
and the complete physical separation of amplified product to avoid con-
tamination of input samples or reagents. Also, prolonged incubation
times, as with extended RT-PCR cycle numbers, can yield false-positive
signals. In a real-time machine, such products can be distinguished by
melting point, but they are indistinguishable by turbidity or colorimetric
assays. Overall, the LAMP assay offers an inexpensive alternative to the
RT-PCR assays currently in use for Zika virus detection, and this direct
assay is fully functional for sensitive detection of Zika virus RNA in
infected mosquitoes.
Public health efforts to control arbovirus infection rely on mosqui-
to control and focused vaccination programs. There is as yet no ap-
proved vaccine for Zika virus, and this virus presents the additional
challenge of sexual transmission (11, 14). Fast and simple virus RNA
detection will support interdiction efforts in mosquitoes and quickly in-
form medical decisions for acutely infected patients. The direct LAMP
assay, without RNA isolation or reverse transcription, can be used to
detect a variety of flaviviruses with the use of appropriate primers. The
ease and cost of any assay influence the degree of its implementation
and, in turn, the extent of vector and reservoir host surveillance and of
transmission control in low-resource settings. In the laboratory, in-
creased speed of the direct LAMP assay will increase productivity in

to further accelerate Zika virus research.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The overall objective of the study was the establishment of a LAMP
assay for the specific detection of Zika virus genomic RNA. The study
required LAMP primer design and testing in cell culture systems,
followed by implementation of the assay in infected mosquitoes for
application to vector competence studies and surveillance. Further
evaluation in specific human biofluids (blood, plasma, saliva, urine,
and semen) was performed by inoculating these samples with tissue
culture virus preparations to test assay function and to determine lim-
its of detection. Comparisons with established RT-PCR assays were
performed with tissue culture virus and recombinant virus RNA. Fi-
nally, initial validations were performed in Zika virus–positive and Zika
virus–negative human clinical samples from Nicaragua and Brazil.
Sample sizes for serum, plasma, and semen samples were defined
by their availability. All available samples were included in the assays,
and results of all assays were reported. All clinical human sera and
plasma samples were provided as blinded samples for assay, evalua-
tion, and tabulation before decoding and revealing of their previously
determined Zika virus status. Individual co-authors were responsible
for sample provision and coding and decoding of samples. Other co-
authors were responsible for assay and tabulation of results before de-
coding. Five semen samples were available for assay and were presented
as Zika virus–positive samples before assay. A minimum of four exper-
imental replicates were performed for each single clinical sample. Con-
trol sample and experimental sample replicates are indicated in the text
and figure legends.
Viruses
Zika virus strain PRVABC59 (GenBank accession no. KU501215) was
isolated at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Fort Collins,
CO) from serum of an infected patient who traveled to Puerto Rico in
2015. Zika virus strain P6-740 (GenBank accession no. HQ234499)
was isolated from infected A. aegypti in Malaysia in 1966 and provided
by the University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston, TX) (36, 37).
Strain 41525 (GenBank accession no. KU955591) was isolated from in-
fected Aedes africanus in Dakar, Senegal, in 1984, and strain MR-766NIID
(GenBank accession no. LC002520) was isolated from blood of a febrile
sentinel rhesus monkey in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947 (38). Ad-
ditional flaviviruses for assessment included Bussuquara (accession no.
AY632536), St. Louis encephalitis (accession no. EF158055), Langat (ac-
cession no. NC_003690), Powassan (accession no. KU886216), Ilheus
(accession no. KC481679), DENV-2 (accession no. U87411), WNV
(accession no. KR868734), YFV (accession no. NC_002031), and the
alphavirus CHIKV (accession no. KT449801). Viruses were propagated
in Vero cells (African green monkey kidney epithelial cells).
Virus infection in cell cultures
Vero and C6/36 (Aedes albopictus) cells were inoculated with Zika virus
at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 to 0.1. Virus was absorbed at room
temperature for 1 hour. Vero cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s mod-
ified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), and C6/36 cells were cultured in mini-
mum essential medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), L-glutamine, and nonessential amino acids. Virus supernatant
was harvested when peak cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed.
Supernatant titers were as follows: PRVABC59, 6.4 × 106 PFU/ml;
41525, 9.8 × 106 PFU/ml; P6-740, 8.5 × 105 PFU/ml; and MR-766NIID,
1.5 × 108 PFU/ml.
RNA isolation
Total cell RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Ambion) when peak
CPE was observed. RNA from viral stocks was purified using the
Mag-Bind Viral DNA/RNA kit (Omega Bio-Tek) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Mosquito rearing and oral infection with Zika virus
The F12 generation of A. aegypti Poza Rica strain, collected from Poza
Rica, Veracruz, Mexico, in 2012, was used (39). At days 5 to 7 after hatch-
ing, pupae were transferred to plastic cups and placed in half-gallon
paperboard cartons for eclosion. Adult mosquitoes were supplied with
raisins as a sugar source and water and maintained at 28°C, 80% rel-
ative humidity, and a 14-hour light/10-hour dark photocycle. At 5 to
7 days after eclosion, mosquitoes were deprived of sugar for 24 hours
and water for 5 hours before an artificial blood meal containing
PRVABC59 Zika virus (40). The infectious blood meal was prepared
by mixing supernatant from Zika virus–infected Vero cells 1:1 with de-
fibrinated calf blood and 1 mM adenosine triphosphate for a blood
meal titer of 1.55 × 107 PFU/ml. The infectious blood meal was placed
in a glass membrane feeder covered with hog gut and warmed with
circulating water at 37°C. Mosquitoes were allowed to feed for 1 hour.
Blood-engorged mosquitoes were sorted and supplied with sugar and
water for 7 or 14 days after infection.
Mosquito sample preparation
Mosquito samples were collected on days 7 or 14 after blood meal.
Whole bodies (wings and legs removed), half bodies (split sagittally),
or mosquito tissues (midguts, salivary glands, and carcasses) were
placed in tubes containing a single stainless steel BB and 250 ml of
mosquito diluent [phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with
20% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin (50 mg/ml), gentamicin (50 mg/ml),
Fungizone (2.5 mg/ml)] or water (half bodies). Mosquitoes and tissues
were homogenized using a Retsch MM400 Mixer Mill homogenizer
at a frequency of 25 cycles per second for 1 min. Samples were subse-
quently centrifuged at 15,000g for 5 min, and supernatant was stored
at −80°C.
Quantification of Zika virus infectious titer by plaque assay
Plaque assays were performed on Vero cells. Briefly, 25 ml of virus super-
natant from infected cells or mosquito homogenates was diluted to
250 ml in PBS with 20% FBS, and 10-fold dilutions were absorbed
on confluent Vero cells for 1 hour at room temperature. The cells were
then overlaid with 3 ml of 1% agarose in DMEM supplemented with
2.5% FBS. After incubation for 4 days, 4% neutral red solution in PBS
was added to the agar overlay, and plaques were counted at 6 to 12 hours
after staining.
LAMP primer selection
A full alignment of the PRVABC59 Puerto Rican strain sequence
(GenBank accession no. KU501215.1) with the sequence of dengue
virus serotype 2 (GenBank accession no. M29095.1) was scanned for
regions of greatest divergence. An 1800-nt region between Zika virus
RNA positions 3500 and 5300 was selected for submission to Eiken’s
LAMP software Primer Explorer V4 (http://primerexplorer.jp/e/; Eiken

 Chemical Company) (15). Five primer sets were identified and tested
for amplification of RNA from PRVABC59-infected Vero cells. African-
lineage–specific primers were selected directly from the primer target
sequences in the sequence of the MR-766NIID Ugandan strain (GenBank
accession no. LC002520).
LAMP target sequence alignment
Geneious version 8.1.6 (41) was used to prepare an alignment of the
full-length LAMP amplified sequence (from F3 to B3; 284 bases) of
PRVABC59 using National Center for Biotechnology Information
BLAST. Duplicated, identical sequences were deleted, and aligned se-
quences were then edited to include only the individual LAMP primer
sequences presented in fig. S3.
LAMP assay
Reactions were prepared as previously described (16). Briefly, 25-ml
reactions were prepared with 8 U of Bst DNA polymerase [version 2.0
WarmStart; New England Biolabs (NEB)] in 20 mM tris (pH 8.8),
10 mM (NH4)2, 8 mM MgSO4, 50 mM KCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1.4 mM
deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) (Thermo Scientific), and 2 mM
SYTO-9 (Life Technologies). Final primer concentrations were 0.2 mM
for F3 and B3 and 1.6 mM for FIP and BIP. After addition of template,
reactions were incubated at 63°C for 90 min in a CFX96 Real-Time
PCR System (Bio-Rad) with fluorescence readings at 1-min intervals.
Lid temperature was 100°C. Reactions were followed with melt curve
analysis; positive reaction product melting points varied from 86.5° to
87.5°C. Background subtraction, thresholds, and trace color and symbol
were performed with Bio-Rad CFX Manager Software. Images of charts
were generated by screen capture and assembled in Photoshop (Adobe).
Human plasma samples were assayed in Applied Biosystems ABI 7500
Real-Time PCR System and analyzed with ABI software at the Labora-
tory of Virology and Experimental Therapeutics, Centro de Pesquisas
Aggeu Magalhaes, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, in Recife-PE, Brazil.
Additional flavivirus LAMP primers for DENV-2, WNV, and YFV
(17, 20, 24) were used under identical assay conditions, without re-
verse transcription, but with the addition of published loop-back prim-
ers. LAMP products were purified with the QIAquick PCR Clean-up
Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions before sub-
mission of 500 ng for sequencing with B3 and F3 primers (Genewiz).
Turbidity was assessed with samples prepared in an identical reac-
tion mix. Reactions were run in TempAssure PCR tubes (USA Scien-
tific) and incubated at 63°C in a MyBlock HL Mini DryBath, Heated Lid
(Benchmark Scientific) with lid temperature set at 100°C for 60 and
70 min before observation and photography with an Apple iPhone.
For PCR amplification, LAMP products were diluted 1:500 and
1 ml was amplified in a 25-ml reaction with 2.5 mM B3 and F3 LAMP
primers in 75 mM tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 20 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.01%
Tween 20, 1 mM dNTPs, 2 mM MgCl2, and 2 U of Taq polymerase
(Thermo Scientific). Reactions were heated to 94°C for 3 min before
35 cycles of 10 s at 94°C, 10 s at 63°C, and 10 s at 72°C. Fifteen micro-
liters from the reactions was separated on a 4% NuSieve agarose gel,
and image was captured with ultraviolet (UV) transillumination and a
Canon digital camera (model SD780 IS). Images were processed uni-
formly in Photoshop (Adobe). The 284–base pair (bp) amplicon was
purified with the QIAquick PCR Clean-up Kit (Qiagen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions before submission of 500 ng for se-
quencing with B3 and F3 primers (Genewiz).
For restriction digestion analysis, 5 mg of LAMP product DNA was
cut with Alu I in a 25-ml reaction with 20 U of enzyme for 1 hour at
37°C. Fifteen microliters of the digest was separated on 4 or 5%
NuSieve gels along with 5 mg of unrestricted LAMP product.
DNase and RNase digestions
Ten-microliter aliquots of positive mosquito homogenate were incu-
bated for 30 min at 37°C with or without 0.2 U of DNase I (Thermo
Scientific) before heat inactivation at 70°C for 5 min. Ten-microliter
aliquots of mock-infected and infected mosquito homogenates and
infected Vero cell supernatant and total cellular RNA were incubated
for 30 min at 37°C with or without 100 mg of RNase A (Qiagen) before
heat inactivation at 70°C for 5 min. Two-microliter samples of each
preparation were subjected to LAMP amplification.
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
Ten nanograms of Zika virus or CHIKV RNAs was amplified in a one-
step RT-PCR with iTaq reverse transcriptase and polymerase (Bio-Rad)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR conditions were
3 min at 94°C and 35 cycles of 15 s at 94°, 15 s at 60°C, and 15 s at 72°C.
Zika virus primers were as follows: nt9014, 5′-AGTGCCAGAGCT-
GTGTGTAC-3′; nt9104, 5′-TCTAGCCCCTAGCCACATGT-3′. CHIKV
primers were as follows: forward, 5′-GTACGGAAGGTAAACT-
GGTATGG-3′; reverse, 5′-TCCACCTCCCACTCCTTAAT-3′ (sequence
based on La Reunion strain, LR2006_OPY1; GenBank accession no.
DQ443544.2).
Flavivirus RNAs were amplified from cDNAs with a pan-flavivirus
primer set, FU1PM and cFD3 (25). These primers yield a different size
product of about 1000 bp from each virus. Ten nanograms of total RNA
from infected cells was first reverse-transcribed with SuperScript IV and
random hexamers (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Two microliters of the reverse transcription reaction was amplified
with Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. PCR conditions were 30 s at 98°C, 4 cycles of 20 s at 98°C,
20 s at 55°C, 30 s at 72°C, and 34 cycles of 20 s at 98°C, 20 s at 62°C, and
30 s at 72°C. All RT-PCRs were run in a Bio-Rad T100 thermal cycler,
amplicons were separated on 4% agarose gels, and image was captured
with UV transillumination and a Canon digital camera (model SD780
IS). Images were processed uniformly in Photoshop (Adobe).
Limit of detection
A full-length Zika virus cDNA clone of RNA from strain PRVABC59
was inserted in the pACYC177 backbone (42). Briefly, PCR products
with overlapping fragments were amplified using q5 high-fidelity
polymerase (NEB) and gel-purified before assembly via circular poly-
merase extension cloning (43). Cloning reactions were transformed into
NEB Stable competent cells, plated on LB agar, and grown overnight at
37°C followed by additional growth (~8 hours) at room temperature.
Small colonies were selected for growth in terrific broth overnight at
30°C. After plasmid purification (Zymo Research), restriction diges-
tion and sequencing confirmed correct insertion of the Zika virus ge-
nome. A full-length clone, pJW223, was transformed into MAX
Efficiency Stbl2 Competent E. coli Cells (Thermo Fisher) under ampi-
cillin selection (100 mg/ml). Plasmid purified from these cells was
linearized with Eco RI–HF (NEB) and RNA-transcribed and template-
digested with a MEGAscript T7 Transcription kit (Ambion/Life Tech-
nologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Unit-length
RNAs were confirmed by gel electrophoresis, concentration was deter-
mined by optical density, and copy number was calculated according to
the molecular weight of the genome sequence (2.184 × 108 copies/ng
RNA; Endmemo.com). Transcribed RNA was diluted to fixed copy

TaqMan probe and primers (Zika1087, Zika1108FAM, and Zika1163c)
in a LightCycler 96 real-time PCR machine (Roche). A minimum of six
technical replicates were assayed at each dilution. Probit analysis was per-
formed using the IBM SPSS Statistics version 24 software to calculate
the LOD and 95% CIs.
Preparation of biofluids inoculated with the PRVABC59
Zika virus strain
Whole blood and plasma were collected from an uninfected donor
under Institutional Review Board protocol no. 09-1148H. Aliquots
of each sample were inoculated with Zika virus–infected Vero cell su-
pernatant (6.4 × 106 PFU/ml; strain PRVABC59) at a final concentra-
tion of 1 × 106 PFU/ml. Additional biofluids were collected from an
uninfected donor and inoculated with the same virus supernatant at a
final concentration of 1 × 106 PFU/ml. Inoculated biofluids were di-
luted 10-fold in water and 2 ml of each dilution subject to LAMP assay.
For the determination of the LOD, inoculated biofluids were first di-
luted 10-fold in the specific biofluid, and then each dilution was diluted
further in water for LAMP assay with six replicates at each dilution.
Further twofold dilution series in biofluid were assayed in a 2-log range
across the LOD with six replicates at each dilution. A minimum of six
technical replicates were assayed at each dilution. Probit analysis was
performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics version 24 software to calculate
the LOD and 95% CIs.
Collection and assessment of human clinical samples
Serum samples
Serum samples were obtained from the Nicaraguan Pediatric Dengue
Cohort Study, a prospective cohort study of ~3500 active participants
2 to 14 years of age in Managua, Nicaragua, that has been ongoing con-
tinuously since 2004. A detailed description of the study design, methods,
and study population has been published previously (44). Zika virus
was included in the cohort as of February 2016. Acute-phase (days
1 to 6 after onset of illness) and convalescent-phase (days 14 to 28)
blood samples were collected from children presenting to the study
health center, Centro de Salud Sócrates Flores Vivas in District II, with
(i) fever or feverishness with two or more of the following symptoms:
headache, muscle ache, joint pain, retro-orbital pain, rash, hemorrhagic
manifestations, or leukopenia; (ii) undifferentiated fever; or (iii) rash
with one or more of the following: conjunctivitis, arthralgia, myalgia,
and/or periarticular edema regardless of fever (since February 2016).
Acute samples were tested by RT-PCR for DENV RNA (45, 46) before
2016 and after February 2016 for both Zika virus and DENV RNA
separately (28, 47) in triplex real-time RT-PCR assays testing for Zika
virus, DENV, and CHIKV RNA (48).
Plasma samples
The Recife cohort samples used for the assays described here were
collected from individuals presenting with acute febrile illnesses in
an urgent health care clinic in the Recife Metropolitan Region from
May 2015 to April 2016, as part of the International Research Con-
sortium on Dengue Risk Assessment, Management and Surveillance
(IDAMS) study (49). The ages of patients from whom sera were used
for the assays varied from 9 to 62 years (mean age, 32), where 27 were
females and 23 were males. Sample collection was performed on the first
day of recruitment (day 1—acute sample), which, following the IDAMS
protocol, corresponds to the period within the first 72 hours of the
febrile period, and on the convalescent phase (days 10 to 30 after
recruitment—convalescent sample). For molecular viral diagnosis,
viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and qRT-PCR for Zika
virus was performed following the protocol of Lanciotti et al. (28, 50).
Samples were also assayed for anti-DENV IgM and IgG and anti–Zika
virus IgM by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The Panbio
Dengue Capture ELISA was used for the anti-DENV IgM and IgG assays
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Anti-Zika IgM was deter-
mined with the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention protocol
(28, 51). Samples were classified as Zika virus–positive if they were
positive for Zika virus RNA by qRT-PCR in the acute phase and pos-
itive for anti–Zika virus IgM with titers more than two times those for
anti-DENV IgM in the convalescent phase when the convalescent
sample was available (37 of 49 patients).
Semen samples
Semen samples were obtained from men with confirmed Zika virus
infection. Semen samples were treated with an equal volume of freshly
prepared 10 mM dithiothreitol (Pierce Biotechnology), and RNA was
extracted from samples using the MagMAX Viral RNA Isolation Kit
(Ambion). Zika virus RNA was detected using the Qiagen QuantiTect
Probe RT-PCR Kit using primers Zika4481/Zika4552c and probe
Zika4507cFAM and PCR settings as described by Lanciotti et al. (28).
A standard curve was generated by in vitro transcription of pCDNA3.1
containing a fragment of Zika virus sequence spanning genomic nucleo-
tides 3576 to 4631.
Statistics
A minimum of six technical replicates were assayed at each dilution
for determination of level of detection. Probit analysis was performed
using the IBM SPSS Statistics version 24 software to calculate the lim-
its of detection and 95% CIs.

interests: The authors declare that they have no competing interests. Data and materials
availability: No materials or clinical samples were transferred from Brazil to Colorado State
University for the purposes of this study. Assays using clinical samples from Brazil were
performed in Recife, Pernambuco, at the Department of Virology, FIOCRUZ-PE. To
the extent that enough samples are available, they may be shared via a material transfer
agreement for use in scientifically sound research in accordance with Brazilian laws,
ethical principles, and governance of the IDAMS project that generated those samples.
Inquiries should be addressed to E.T.A.M. (marques@pitt.edu). Assays of Nicaraguan
samples were performed at the Colorado State University. If sufficient, Nicaraguan
samples may be shared for use in scientifically sound and collaborative research.
Inquiries should be addressed to E.H. of the University of California, Berkeley
(eharris@berkeley.edu).
