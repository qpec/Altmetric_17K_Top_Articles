Children spend the majority of their time at school and 
are particularly vulnerable to the negative emotional and 
behavioral impacts of disasters, including anxiety, depressive 
symptoms, impaired social relationships, and poor school 
performance (1). Because of concerns about inadequate school-
based emergency planning to address the unique needs of chil-
dren and the adults who support them, Healthy People 2020 
includes objectives to improve school preparedness, response, 
and recovery plans (Preparedness [PREP]-5) (2). To examine 
improvements over time and gaps in school preparedness plans, 
data from the 2006, 2012, and 2016 School Health Policies 
and Practices Study (SHPPS) were analyzed to assess changes 
in the percentage of districts meeting PREP-5 objectives. 
Findings from these analyses indicate that districts met the 
PREP-5 objective for requiring schools to include post-disaster 
mental health services in their crisis preparedness plans for 
the first time in 2016. However, trend analyses did not reveal 
statistically significant increases from 2006 to 2016 in the 
percentage of districts meeting any of the PREP-5 objectives. 
Differences in preparedness were detected in analyses stratified 
by urbanicity and census region, highlighting strengths and 
challenges in emergency planning for schools. To promote 
the health and safety of faculty, staff members, children, and 
families, school districts are encouraged to adopt and imple-
ment policies to improve school crisis preparedness, response, 
and recovery plans.
SHPPS is a national survey periodically conducted by CDC 
to assess school health policies and practices (3). This report 
used district-level data from the 2006, 2012, and 2016 surveys. 
In each study year, a nationally representative sample of public 
school districts is drawn using a two-stage sample design. Five 
to seven questionnaires, each assessing a different component 
of school health, are administered in each sampled district via 
paper and pencil or online. This report summarizes results 
from the crisis preparedness module within the healthy and 
safe school environment questionnaire. Across the three study 
years, the number of sampled districts that completed this 
questionnaire ranged from 461 to 697, and the response rates 
ranged from 64.0% to 66.5%.
Each district identified the respondent who had primary 
responsibility for, or was most knowledgeable about, the 
content of each questionnaire. Respondents to the crisis pre-
paredness module were asked whether their school district 
required schools to have a comprehensive plan to address crisis

preparedness, response, and recovery that included four specific 
topics identified in PREP-5: family reunification procedures, 
procedures for responding to pandemic influenza or other 
infectious disease outbreaks (only asked in 2012 and 2016), 
provisions for students and staff members with special needs, 
and provision of mental health services for students and staff 
members after a crisis. Respondents also were asked whether 
their district provided funding for training or offered training 
on their crisis preparedness plans to school faculty and staff 
members, students, and students’ families, and whether their 
district offered education on crisis preparedness, response, and 
recovery to students’ families. To categorize SHPPS school 
districts accurately into U.S. Census regions, SHPPS data 
were linked to extant data from the Market Data Retrieval 
database (4), a commercial database that compiles a list of 
K–12 schools in the United States along with their charac-
teristics. Analyses were stratified by census region (Midwest, 
Northeast, South, or West); urbanicity (city, suburb, town, or 
rural); and district enrollment size (small [≤4,999 students], 
medium [5,000–9,999], or large [≥10,000]).
Data from each study year were weighted to provide national 
estimates. Analyses using statistical software accounted for 
the complex sample design. Prevalence estimates and 95% 
confidence intervals were computed for all point estimates. 
Statistical significance (p<0.05) for linear trends was deter-
mined using logistic regression analyses with data from all 
3 years. The 2016 data only were used for descriptive statis-
tics related to training and education. T-tests were used to 
determine differences between subgroups, with p-values <0.05 
considered statistically significant.
Overall, no significant changes over time were detected in 
the percentage of districts that required schools to include 
specific topics in their school crisis preparedness, response, and 
recovery plans that correspond to the Healthy People 2020 
PREP-5 objectives (Table 1) (Table 2). Notably, the Healthy 
People 2020 district requirements for school plans to include 
provision of mental health services for students, faculty, and 
staff members after a crisis (PREP-5.4; target ≥76.2%) was 
met (77.6%) for the first time in 2016 (Table 2).
Assessing district requirements by subgroup identified a 
significant increase in the percentage of districts in suburban 
areas that required schools to include family reunification 
procedures in their plans (PREP-5.1) from 2006 to 2016 
and a linear increase in this requirement among districts in 
the Northeast (p = 0.05) (Table 1). The percentage of school 
districts that required schools to include procedures for 
responding to pandemic influenza or other infectious disease 
outbreaks in their plans (PREP-5.2) decreased significantly in 
rural areas (p<0.05) and among districts in the South (p = 0.05) 
(Table 1). By 2016, all Healthy People 2020 targets assessed 
were met in large school districts, although trends were not 
statistically significant.
In 2016, large districts were significantly more likely than 
were small districts to provide funding for or offer training 
on crisis preparedness for school faculty, staff members, and 
students’ families (p<0.05) (Table 3). Compared with districts

in the Midwest, districts in the South were less likely to provide 
funding for training or offer training on crisis preparedness 
for school faculty and staff members (p<0.05). In contrast, 
districts in the Midwest were less likely than were those in the 
Northeast, South, and West to provide funding for training 
or to offer training on crisis preparedness for students’ families 
(p<0.05). Districts in the Midwest also were less likely than 
were those in the West to offer education on crisis prepared-
ness, response, and recovery to students’ families (p<0.05).
Discussion
These findings highlight strengths and challenges in emer-
gency planning for schools. In 2016, the Healthy People 
2020 goal requiring school districts to have plans in place 
that include provision of mental health services for students, 
faculty, and staff members after a crisis was achieved nationally 
for the first time, suggesting that school districts increasingly 
recognize the importance of addressing post-disaster mental 
health needs as a vital part of crisis recovery. In addition, over 
the past decade, improvements were made for inclusion of

family reunification procedures after a crisis at the national 
level, particularly in suburban schools and schools in the 
northeastern United States (5).
Despite this progress, gaps in achieving school preparedness 
goals at the national level persist, and progress in many essential 
areas is minimal. Whereas the majority of school districts have 
plans to address mental health needs and family reunification 
after an emergency, nationally, approximately one in four dis-
tricts fall short of these goals, and one in three school districts 
does not have policies in place to prepare for an infectious 
disease outbreak. Because schools often function as community 
hubs, these gaps in preparedness planning leave communities 
potentially vulnerable to critical public health threats.
Preparedness planning was not consistent across localities. 
The percentage of rural school districts that included proce-
dures for responding to pandemic influenza or other infec-
tious disease outbreaks in their preparedness plans decreased 
significantly over time and was lower than the percentage 
among urban and suburban districts and towns. Furthermore, 
compared with large districts, a significantly lower percentage 
of small districts provided funding for training or offered train-
ing for crisis preparedness for school faculty, staff members, and 
students’ families. Because schools can be a central gathering

place during an emergency in low population density areas, 
the decreases in infectious disease preparedness plans and lack 
of resources to support emergency preparedness could lead 
to a gap in coverage when an event occurs. School adminis-
trators have the opportunity to lead health promotion and 
safety in rural and smaller communities. Schools can serve as 
a centralized, familiar rallying point for communities during 
crises; however, technical support and resources are needed to 
ensure successful planning for administrators. Regular train-
ing regarding crisis preparedness, response, and recovery for 
students and their families is essential to ensuring that com-
munities are ready when disaster strikes. School districts can 
partner with local and regional public health departments to 
determine how best to use limited resources, identify emerging 
themes in responses, and review emergency operations plans 
to identify best practices.
To promote the health and safety of faculty, staff members, 
children, and families and meet the Healthy People 2020 
preparedness targets, more school districts can adopt and 
implement preparedness policies. Adoption of family reunifica-
tion procedures might include steps to determine alternative 
school sheltering locations and family communication mes-
saging (e.g., text messaging) to allow schools and communities 
to avoid extensive challenges to reuniting families, such as 
those observed after Hurricane Katrina (6,7). Timely fam-
ily reunification promotes post-disaster recovery for adults 
and children, benefitting the health of communities and the 
population as a whole (7). Strengthening policies and planning 
for infectious disease outbreaks is vital to ensuring that com-
munities remain healthy and productive (8). The 2014 Ebola 
outbreak in West Africa closed schools in affected areas for up 
to 10 months (9), compromising the health and well-being 
of children, staff members, and faculty who rely on schools 
for a sense of normalcy during a crisis. Therefore, school dis-
tricts should consider developing customized protocols in the 
event of an outbreak of seasonal influenza (10). In the United 
States, the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Safe and 
Healthy Student, Readiness and Emergency Management for 
Schools Technical Assistance Center* and CDC’s Children’s 
Preparedness Unit† have developed a suite of publications and

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Healthy People 2020 includes objectives to improve school 
preparedness, response, and recovery plans in the event 
of a disaster.
What is added by this report?
Analyses of data found differences in trends by urbanicity in 
district requirements for crisis plans. In 2016, large districts 
(≥10,000 students) were significantly more likely than were 
small districts (≤4,999 students) to provide funding for or offer 
training on crisis preparedness for school faculty, staff members, 
and students’ families.
What are the implications for public health practice?
To meet Healthy People 2020 targets, increases are needed in 
district adoption and implementation of policies. Strengthening 
plans for infectious disease outbreaks, especially in rural 
districts, could help ensure that children and communities 
remain healthy and productive.
tools to help schools and families prepare for, respond to, and 
recover from emergencies.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three 
limitations. First, SHPPS data are self-reported and thus are 
subject to bias. Second, SHPPS documentation states that the 
word “policy” refers to any law, rule, regulation, administrative 
order, or similar kind of mandate issued by the local school 
board or other local agency with authority over schools in 
districts; this might be interpreted differently by individual 
respondents. Finally, the binary response option (yes/no) does 
not indicate whether a school district has taken action on the 
policy in question.
During the past decade, more school districts have adopted 
policies requiring certain preparedness measures for schools. 
However, school districts have not met all of the target goals 
of the Healthy People 2020 PREP-5 objectives, indicating 
suboptimal preparedness planning in some localities. Findings 
from this report highlight the need for wider adoption of 
policies on family reunification, pandemic influenza and 
other infectious disease outbreak procedures, and provisions 
for students and staff members with special needs, particularly 
in rural areas. School district-specific information on school 
crisis preparedness planning and training might help identify 
and address disparities and critical gaps in preparedness and 
response policies and plans for children. Adoption of strong 
policies by school districts can promote the health and safety 
of faculty, staff members, children, and families and meet the 
Healthy People 2020 preparedness objectives [PREP-5] for 
safe school environments.
