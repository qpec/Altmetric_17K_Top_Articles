Abstract
Background—Median overall survival for patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma is 12 to 
16 months. Olaratumab is a human anti–platelet-derived growth factor receptor α monoclonal 
antibody which has antitumour activity in human sarcoma xenografts.
Methods—We conducted an open-label phase 1b, randomised, phase 2 study of doxorubicin ± 
olaratumab in patients with unresectable/metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. The phase 1b primary 
endpoint was safety; the phase 2 primary endpoint was progression-free survival using a two-sided 
alpha level of 0·2 and statistical power of 0·8. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT01185964.
Findings—Fifteen patients were enrolled and treated with olaratumab+doxorubicin in the phase 
1b portion; 133 patients were randomised (66 to olaratumab+doxorubicin; 67 to doxorubicin) in 
the phase 2 portion, 129 of whom (97%) received at least one dose of study treatment (64 
olaratumab+doxorubicin; 65 doxorubicin). Median progression-free survival in phase 2 was 6·6 
months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4·1–8·3) with olaratumab+doxorubicin and 4·1 months 
(95% CI, 2·8–5·4) with doxorubicin (stratified hazard ratio [HR], 0·672; 95% CI, 0·442–1·021; 
p=0·0615). Median overall survival was 26·5 months (95% CI, 20·9–31·7) with olaratumab
+doxorubicin and 14·7 months (95% CI, 9·2–17·1) with doxorubicin (stratified HR, 0·463; 95% 
CI, 0·301–0·710; p=0·0003). Adverse events more frequent with olaratumab+doxorubicin vs 
doxorubicin alone included neutropenia (38 [59%] vs 25 [39%]), mucositis (34 [53%] vs 23 
[35%]), nausea (47 [73%] vs 34 [52%]), vomiting (29 [45%] vs 12 [19%]), and diarrhea (22 [34%] 
vs 15 [23%]). Febrile neutropenia of grade ≥3 was similar in both groups (olaratumab plus 
doxorubicin 8 (13%) vs doxorubicin 9 (14%).
Interpretation—This study of olaratumab with doxorubicin in patients with advanced soft tissue 
sarcoma met its predefined primary endpoint for progression-free survival and achieved a highly 
significant improvement of 11·8 months in median overall survival (P=0·0003; HR 0·46).

Introduction
Soft tissue sarcoma is a rare and diverse group of solid tumours originating from 
mesenchymal precursors1,2. They account for approximately 1% of all new adult 
malignancies.2,3 Doxorubicin, either alone or in combination, remains a standard of care.

 However, survival for treated patients with metastatic disease is only 12 to 16 months, and 
the two-year survival rate is approximately 30%.4,5 Few, if any, novel therapies or 
chemotherapy combinations have been able to improve these poor outcomes3–5; 
consequently, soft tissue sarcoma represents an important unmet medical need.
Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)/PDGF receptor (PDGFR) signaling plays a 
significant role in mesenchymal biology, including mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, 
growth, and angiogenesis.6,7 The PDGF/PDGFR signaling pathway is also involved in 
cancer through aberrant cellular signaling and has been implicated in modulating the 
tumour/stromal microenvironment and facilitating metastases in numerous malignancies.8,9
Olaratumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G subclass 1 (IgG1) monoclonal 
antibody that specifically binds PDGFRα, blocking PDGF-AA, -BB, and -CC binding and 
receptor activation.10 Preclinical studies of olaratumab alone10 or in combination with 
doxorubicin11 have demonstrated antitumour activity in human sarcoma xenograft models. 
Based on these preclinical data and the rationale for disrupting PDGF/PDGFR signaling in 
sarcoma cells and the tumour/stromal microenvironment, we performed a phase 1b/
randomised phase 2 study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of adding olaratumab to 
doxorubicin in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma.
Methods
Patients and Methods
Patients were enrolled at 16 clinical sites in the United States. For both the phase 1b and 2 
portions of the study, eligible patients were ≥18 years of age and had a histologically 
confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma not previously 
treated with an anthracycline, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status of 0 to 2, and available tumour tissue to determine PDGFRα expression 
by immunohistochemistry. The phase 1b primary endpoint was safety. The phase 2 primary 
endpoint was progression-free survival; secondary endpoints included overall survival, 
objective response rate, safety, and pharmacokinetics (Methods section, Supplementary 
Appendix).
In the phase 1b portion of the study, patients received olaratumab (15 mg/kg) intravenously 
on day 1 and day 8 plus doxorubicin (75 mg/m2) on day 1 of each 21-day cycle for up to 8 
cycles. After 8 cycles of the combination, in the absence of disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicities, patients were allowed to receive olaratumab monotherapy until 
disease progression. During cycles 5 through 8, dexrazoxane was allowed on day 1 of each 
cycle to reduce the potential for doxorubicin-related cardiotoxicity. The phase 1b portion 
was closed to enrolment once ten patients had received study treatment for two cycles.
Randomisation
In the open-label phase 2 portion of the study, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio 
to receive olaratumab plus doxorubicin (as described in the phase 1b portion) or doxorubicin 
alone (75 mg/m2) on day 1 of each 21-day cycle for up to 8 cycles (Methods section, 
Supplementary Appendix). Dexrazoxane was allowed in both treatment groups during cycles

 5 through 8 of doxorubicin. After completion of 8 cycles of doxorubicin, patients in the 
olaratumab+doxorubicin group could receive olaratumab monotherapy until disease 
progression, and patients in the doxorubicin group were observed and could receive 
olaratumab monotherapy after documented disease progression.
Randomisation was dynamic and used the minimization randomisation technique12 to 
balance patients by ECOG performance status (0–1 vs 2), histological tumour type 
(leiomyosarcoma vs synovial sarcoma vs other), immunohistochemical PDGFR expression 
(positive vs negative), and previous lines of treatment (0 vs ≥1 line of therapy) (Methods 
section, Supplementary Appendix).
Tumour response was assessed every 6 weeks according to the Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumours, version 1·113 (Methods section, Supplementary Appendix). Survival was 
assessed every 2 months until study completion. Blood samples were collected for 
pharmacokinetic and immunogenic analyses. Safety was assessed for all patients who 
received at least one dose of study treatment. Adverse events and clinical laboratory toxicity 
were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events, version 4·0. Cardiac function was monitored by echocardiography or 
multigated acquisition scanning before treatment start and before treatment at cycles 5 and 7.
PDGFRα Assessment
PDGFR expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry at a central academic laboratory 
before enrolment (phase 1b) or randomisation (phase 2) (Methods section, Supplementary 
Appendix). After the study was completed, the randomisation assay was found to recognize 
both PDGFRα and β, so an additional PDGFRα-specific assay was developed and used for 
all post-hoc efficacy analyses.
Statistical Analysis
The Phase 1b part of the trial was intended to provide an initial look at safety outcomes 
relative to dosage and exposure in a small number of patients. For this purpose, a pragmatic 
decision to enroll 10–15 patients was made without formal statistical considerations. The 
phase 2 planned sample size was 130 patients, which assumed a 50% improvement in 
median progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0·67) for the olaratumab+doxorubicin 
group, a statistical power of 80%, and a two-sided significance level of 0·20. A planned 
interim analysis of the primary endpoint was performed with a nominal alpha spend of 
0·0001, resulting in a final nominal adjusted alpha level of 0·1999 (two-sided).
The efficacy analyses were performed in the randomisation patient population (intention-to-
treat population). The safety analyses were performed in the population of patients who 
received at least one dose of study treatment (safety population).

Results
Study Population
From 6 October 2010 through 14 January 2013, 15 patients were enrolled and treated in the 
phase 1b portion of the study (figure S1), and 133 patients were randomised (66 to 
olaratumab+doxorubicin; 67 to doxorubicin) in the phase 2 portion, 129 of whom (97%) 
received at least one dose of study treatment (64 in the olaratumab+doxorubicin group; 65 in 
the doxorubicin group) (figure 1). Baseline characteristics (tables 1,2, and S1) were balanced 
except for slightly more women in the combination arm.
Progression-free Survival
Final analysis of the phase 2 primary endpoint of progression-free survival based on 
investigator assessment was performed after 103 events. The median progression-free 
survival was 6·6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4·1–8·3; interquartile range [IQR], 
2·7–10·2) with olaratumab+doxorubicin and 4·1 months (95% CI, 2·8–5·4; IQR, 1·6–7·4) 
with doxorubicin (figure 2A; table S2). This improvement in favor of olaratumab
+doxorubicin met the protocol-defined significance level of 0·1999 for final progression-free 
survival (stratified HR, 0·672; 95% CI, 0·442–1·021; p=0·0615). A blinded independent 
retrospective review of the radiologic scans (figure S2) showed a comparable HR (0·670; 
95% CI, 0·04–1·12; p=0·1208) and a median progression-free survival of 8·2 months (95% 
CI, 5·5–9·8; IQR, 3·0–11·6) with olaratumab+doxorubicin and 4·4 months (95% CI, 3·1–7·4; 
IQR, 1·5–8·6) with doxorubicin. The 3-month and 6-month progression-free survival rates 
are provided in supplementary table S2.
Objective Response Rate
The objective response rate was 18·2% (95% CI, 9·8–29·6) with olaratumab+doxorubicin 
and 11·9% (95% CI, 5·3–22·2) with doxorubicin (p=0·3421) (table S3). The objective 
response rate for the independent assessment was 18·2% (95% CI, 29·6–29·8) with 
olaratumab+doxorubicin and 7·5% (95% CI, 2·5–16·6) with doxorubicin (p=0·0740) (table 
S3). The disease control rate and median duration of response are provided in supplementary 
table S3.

 Overall Survival
Final analysis of overall survival was performed per protocol after 91 deaths, approximately 
70% of the intention-to-treat population. The median overall survival was 26·5 months (95% 
CI, 20·9–31·7; IQR, 13·8 to not evaluable) with olaratumab+doxorubicin and 14·7 months 
(95% CI, 9·2–17·1; IQR, 5·5–26·0) with doxorubicin (figure 2B). This difference of 11·8 
months represented a statistically significant improvement in median overall survival 
(stratified HR, 0·46; 95% CI, 0·30–0·71; p=0·0003) and was consistent across the subgroup 
stratification factors including histological tumour type (leiomysarcoma vs non-
leiomyosarcoma), number of lines of previous treatment (0 vs ≥1), and PDGFRα status 
(figure 3). More than 65% of patients in each of the two treatment groups received 
subsequent therapy after disease progression (table 3 and table S4). Sensitivity analyses for 
overall survival are shown in tables S5 and S6.
Pharmacokinetics and Exposure-response Analysis
Olaratumab serum concentration levels were available from 92 patients. Olaratumab mean 
maximum serum concentration (Cmax) reached 284 μg/mL (geometric coefficient of 
variation in % [CV%], 23∙3) and 293 μg/mL (CV%, 30∙5) after the first and second doses 
and returned to a mean trough serum concentration (Cmin) of 66∙5 μg/mL (CV%, 40∙4) at the 
end of the cycle (table S7). Steady state was reached during cycle 3; mean steady state Cmax 
and Cmin ranged from 419 μg/mL (CV%, 26∙2) through 487 μg/mL (CV%, 33∙0) and from 
123 μg/mL (CV%, 31∙2) through 156 μg/mL (CV%, 38∙0) across cycles 4 through 9. 
Individual apparent terminal elimination half-life estimates of 6∙67 days and 14∙4 days were 
obtained during cycle 3 (table S8). Olaratumab serum levels observed in patients randomised 
to the doxorubicin group, who received olaratumab monotherapy after disease progression, 
were similar to those observed in patients in the olaratumab+doxorubicin group (table S7) 
Exposure-response analyses indicated that patients in the upper quartiles of olaratumab 
serum exposure showed a greater improvement in progression-free survival and overall 
survival, regardless of the pharmacokinetic endpoint considered (Cmin at the end of cycle 1, 
or average serum concentration throughout the treatment duration) (figures S3 and S4, tables 
S9 and S10).
Treatment Exposure
The median number of doxorubicin infusions was 7 (range, 1 to 8; IQR, 3 to 8) with a 
median cumulative dose level of 487∙6 mg/m2 (IQR, 221.7–598.8) in the olaratumab
+doxorubicin group (table S11) and 4 infusions (range, 1 to 8; IQR, 2 to 8) with a median 
cumulative dose level of 299∙6 mg/m2 (IQR, 150.1–494.7) in the doxorubicin group. The 
median number of olaratumab infusions in the olaratumab+doxorubicin group was 16∙5 
(range, 1∙0 to 83∙0, IQR 6 to 25.5) (table S12). The most common reason for discontinuation 
from study therapy in both groups was progression of disease (figure 1). The most common 
adverse event leading to patient discontinuation of doxorubicin was ejection-fraction 
decrease: 3 patients (5%) with olaratumab+doxorubicin and 4 patients (6%) with 
doxorubicin; the most common adverse event leading to discontinuation of olaratumab was 
infusion-related reaction: 2 patients (3%). In the olaratumab+doxorubicin group, 34 (53%) 
of 64 patients ended the olaratumab-doxorubicin combination therapy and received one or

 more cycles of olaratumab monotherapy (median, 9 infusions; range, 2 to 68; IQR 4 to 24; 
median, 4.5 cycles; IQR, 2 to 12) (Table S12). In the doxorubicin group, 30 (46%) of 65 
patients opted to receive olaratumab monotherapy after disease progression and received a 
median of 4 infusions (range, 1 to 81; IQR, 4 to 8; median, 2 cycles; IQR, 2 to 4) (Table 
S12).
Adverse Events
Treatment-emergent adverse events are summarized in table S13 (phase 1b) and table 4 
(phase 2). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events with olaratumab
+doxorubicin in the phase 2 portion were nausea (n = 47 [73%]), fatigue (44 [69%]), 
neutropenia (38 [59%]), and mucositis (34 [53%]); and with doxorubicin, fatigue (45 
[69%]), nausea (34 [52%]), alopecia (26 [40%]), and neutropenia (25 [39%]) (table 4).
Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher and serious adverse events of grade 3 
or higher were more frequent with olaratumab+doxorubicin than doxorubicin (43 [67%] vs 
36 [55%] and 27 [42%] vs 22 [34%]) (table 4). Fatigue and neutropenia of grade 3 or higher 
were more frequent with olaratumab+doxorubicin (6 [9%] and 35 [55%]) than with 
doxorubicin (2 [3%] and 22 [34%]). However, the incidence of febrile neutropenia was 
similar in both groups: olaratumab+ doxorubicin (8 [13%]) vs doxorubicin (9 [14%]). The 
percentage of patients who discontinued treatment because of an adverse event was lower 
with olaratumab+doxorubicin than with doxorubicin (8 [13%] vs 12 [19%]).
Of the 129 treated patients in the phase 2 portion of the study, 39 (61%) in the olaratumab
+doxorubicin group and 51 (79%) in the doxorubicin group had died at the time of data 
cutoff. In the olaratumab+doxorubicin group, death was attributed to disease progression in 
38 patients and an unknown cause in one patient. In the doxorubicin group, death was 
attributed to disease progression in 44 patients, adverse events in six patients (aspirational 
pneumonia, respiratory failure, sepsis, septic shock, and small bowel obstruction), and an 
unknown cause in one patient. Doxorubicin-related toxicities (neutropenia, mucositis, 
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) were more frequent in patients treated with the combination 
but did not result in an increased number of febrile neutropenia events, hospitalisations 
(table S14), treatment discontinuations, or deaths.
The incidence of cardiac dysfunction (consolidated term comprised of peripheral edema, 
ejection fraction decreased, congestive cardiac failure, hepatojugular reflux, jugular vein 
distention and left ventricular dysfunction; any grade) was 23% (15 patients) with 
olaratumab+doxorubicin and 17% (11 patients) with doxorubicin (table 4). Excluding the 
patients with peripheral edema (none reported other adverse events to suggest cardiac 
dysfunction), the total incidence of cardiac dysfunction was 8% (5 patients) with olaratumab
+doxorubicin and 6% (4 patients) with doxorubicin. Changes in left ventricular ejection 
fraction from baseline are summarized in table 4.
Immunogenicity
Eighty-five patients were evaluable for the presence or absence of antidrug antibodies. The 
overall incidence of treatment-emergent antidrug antibodies was 6% (5 of 85) (table S15); 
no effect of immunogenicity on safety or pharmacokinetics was observed.

 PDGFRα Assessment and Outcomes Comparison
Analysis of PDGFRα-expression showed that 88% (doxorubicin+olaratumab) and 88% 
(doxorubicin) of tumours were PDGFRα-positive (Table 1). However, this assay was 
subsequently found to have poor specificity for PDGFRα, also detecting PDGFRβ, 
precluding meaningful data analysis. Reanalysis of study tumour samples with an assay with 
better specificity for PDGFRα demonstrated that 33% (doxorubicin+olaratumab) and 34% 
(doxorubicin) of tumours were positive for PDGFRα, consistent with a recent study.14 The 
interaction effect between PDGFRα expression (positive or negative) and treatment was not 
significant for either overall or progression-free survival (interaction p-values 0·3209 and 
0·5924).
Discussion
The combination of olaratumab plus doxorubicin improved both progression-free and 
overall survival compared with the standard-of-care doxorubicin in patients with advanced 
soft tissue sarcoma. Analyses of pretreatment, concomitant, and posttreatment factors 
revealed no consistent imbalances that could have meaningfully affected the robustness of 
the study results. Treatment arms were well-balanced for line of treatment, performance 
status, and prognostic factors implicated in soft tissue sarcoma.15 Although the rate of 
discontinuation because of adverse events was higher in the control arm, most were 
considered serious adverse events, and single-agent doxorubicin performed as expected from 
historical data.4,16–18 A sensitivity analysis of patients discontinuing study treatment 
because of adverse events or symptomatic progressive disease within the first 8 cycles, or 
patients completing fewer than 4 cycles of doxorubicin, showed hazard ratios similar to the 
overall study, making these factors an unlikely source of bias for the observed overall 
survival results. The number of poststudy lines of treatment were relatively well balanced on 
both arms with modest imbalances in some chemotherapeutic agents. Sensitivity analysis 
censoring patients at the start of any new anti-cancer treatment or upon starting select 
chemotherapeutic agents showed hazard ratios similar to the overall study. It also should be 
noted that none of these agents have been demonstrated to improve median overall survival 
in the broad soft tissue sarcoma population. Lastly, the early separation of the overall 
survival curves is consistent with an effect of the combination rather than confounding post 
treatment factors.
The magnitude of improvement observed in median overall survival with olaratumab and 
doxorubicin (80%; 11·8 months) was greater than that observed in progression-free survival 
(61%; 2·5 months). This finding suggests that the inhibitory effect of olaratumab on tumour 
and stromal PDGFRα signaling may persist beyond the immediate treatment period. While 
tumour PDGFRα expression alone did not correlate with outcome, tumour samples available 
for study were a heterogeneous mixture of archival primary and metastatic tumours. 
Ongoing and future work will explore both tumour and stromal expression of PDGFRα and 
related ligands and more fully characterize immunohistochemical criteria for PDGFRα 
positivity.
Our findings are particularly notable given the limited progress in improving median overall 
survival in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Most patients are treated with

 traditional regimens of doxorubicin or doxorubicin in combination with ifosfamide; 
however, the prognosis for patients with metastatic disease remains poor as the efficacy of 
these and other treatment options are limited. In a recent phase 3 study by the European 
Organisation for Treatment of Cancer Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group, doxorubicin 
plus high-dose ifosfamide improved progression-free survival and response rates over 
doxorubicin alone.4 These important palliative outcomes were achieved at the expense of 
greater drug toxicity and without an improvement in median overall survival over 
doxorubicin alone (14·3 vs 12·8 months, respectively [HR, 0·83; P=0·076]). Other recent 
combination and novel-agent studies also did not show improvement in overall survival over 
doxorubicin alone,5,17,19–22 reinforcing the challenging nature of improving outcomes in 
advanced soft tissue sarcoma.
In conclusion, this study of olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin met its predefined, 
statistical, primary endpoint for progression-free survival and achieved a highly statistically 
significant improvement of 11·8 months in median overall survival over doxorubicin alone. 
Importantly, the improvement in median overall survival was achieved without an increase in 
serious toxicity, despite a higher cumulative exposure to doxorubicin. Although the rate of 
some doxorubicin-associated toxicities such as neutropenia and mucositis were higher in the 
combination arm, this did not lead to a higher rate of febrile neutropenia, infection, 
hospitalisation, or treatment-related mortality. Altogether, the pronounced survival benefit, 
along with an acceptable safety profile including cardiac safety, represents a positive benefit-
risk profile for olaratumab+doxorubicin in the treatment of patients with soft tissue sarcoma.

 Panel: Research in context
Evidence before this study
A detailed PubMed search was performed in English to identify all randomized trials 
involving single agent doxorubicin from 1980 to February 25, 2016. The terms utilized in 
the search included: “soft tissue”, “sarcoma”, “doxorubicin”, “randomized”, and “trial”. 
We identified 19 randomized phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials, none of which showed an 
overall survival advantage of single agent or combination therapy over doxorubicin alone.
Added value of this study
Our study is the first randomized study to show increased survival for patients with soft 
tissue sarcoma treated with an agent added to doxorubicin therapy. In our study, the 
combination of olaratumab plus doxorubicin improved both progression-free and overall 
survival compared with the standard of care doxorubicin in patients with advanced soft 
tissue sarcoma. The improvement of 11.8 months in median overall survival is highly 
significant, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in our treatment.
Implications of all the available evidence
The magnitude of improvement observed in median overall survival with olaratumab and 
doxorubicin was 80% (11·8 months) and that in progression-free survival was 61% (2·5 
months), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of olaratumab on tumour and stromal 
PDGFRα signaling may persist beyond the immediate treatment period. These clinical 
results are being confirmed in a large international randomized phase 3 study. Further 
refinement of the understanding of PDGFRα in the context of tumour and stroma is 
currently a focus of ongoing investigations.
