Abstract
Introduction
During the past 30 years, local and state tobacco use control laws
in the United States have helped reduce smoking prevalence and
exposure to secondhand smoke, but progress among low socioeco-
nomic populations has been slow. Implementing smoke-free hous-
ing policies in affordable housing may help address this issue. The
purpose of our study was to assess how such policies affect
smoking rates and exposure to secondhand smoke among resid-
ents of affordable housing.
Methods
We conducted a pretest–posttest longitudinal study of 180 resid-
ents from 8 affordable housing properties in Minnesota. Participat-
ing properties agreed to adopt a smoke-free housing policy cover-
ing indoor grounds, and 3 of these properties also prohibited
smoking on all outdoor grounds. Policies were implemented with
assistance from local public health departments and the Statewide
Health Improvement Program. Participants completed surveys one
month before policy implementation and 6 months postimplement-
ation. Surveys assessed smoking, quit attempts, and indoor and
outdoor secondhand smoke exposure.
Results
Results indicated a significant reduction in nonsmokers’ indoor
exposure to secondhand smoke (F1,144 = 22.69, P < .001) and no
change in outdoor exposure  to secondhand smoke from Time 1
(pretest)  to Time 2 (posttest) (F1,140 = 2.17, P = .14). However,
when examining sites that only prohibited smoking indoors, we
observed an increase in outdoor secondhand smoke exposure that
approached significance (F1,118 = 3.76, P = .055). Results showed
no change in quit attempts over time, but 77% of residents who
smoked at pretest reported reducing the amount that they smoked
at posttest, and an additional 5% reported that they had quit.
Conclusions
Smoke-free housing policies may be an effective strategy to re-
duce exposure to indoor secondhand exposure and promote de-
creased cigarette smoking among residents of affordable housing.
Introduction
Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death in the
United States, contributing to more than 480,000 deaths per year
among smokers and 50,000 deaths among nonsmokers (1). Dur-
ing the past 30 years local and state tobacco use control laws such
as those that prohibit smoking in restaurants and bars have helped
reduce smoking prevalence by 40% and exposure of nonsmokers
to secondhand smoke by 71% (2–5). Despite declines in these in-
dicators for the general population, progress has been consider-
ably slower for populations of low socioeconomic status, who ex-
perience a disproportionate burden of harm from smoking (5–7).
This is particularly true in Minnesota where the rate of smoking is
121% higher among those without a high school degree than
among those with more than a high school degree (8).

 Because smoking rates are disproportionately high among popula-
tions of low socioeconomic status, the risk of secondhand smoke
exposure among these groups is high. Results from a nationally
representative study showed that nonsmokers with an annual
household income of less than $20,000 were 36% more likely to
have elevated serum cotinine levels — a marker of high second-
hand smoke exposure — than those with an annual household in-
come of $20,000 or more (9). Researchers have posited that a
primary contributor to socioeconomic disparities in secondhand
smoke exposure is unequal access to quality housing, and a
primary component of quality housing is a smoke-free environ-
ment. People of low socioeconomic status have less access to
smoke-free housing than do those of high socioeconomic status
and consequently are more likely to live in multi-unit buildings
where smoking is permitted in individual housing units (10). Con-
sequently, people of low socioeconomic status are at increased
risk of secondhand smoke exposure in the home environment,
which is where people spend 69% of their time (11).
In 2007, Minnesota passed the Clean Indoor Air Act, which pro-
hibits smoking in most indoor public spaces, including common
areas in rental apartment buildings. However, this law did not pro-
hibit smoking in individual units, leaving open the possibility that
smoke from one unit could transfer to other units. Investigations of
secondhand smoke in multi-unit residential buildings found nicot-
ine concentrations in units without smokers to be comparable to
those of units with smokers, suggesting that secondhand smoke in-
filtration from neighboring units may be substantial (12). Consist-
ent with these findings, studies found that indoor secondhand
smoke exposure among nonsmokers in such housing is common,
with 53% of residents reporting any exposure (13) and 41% re-
porting frequent exposure (14).
Smoke-free policies for multi-unit housing can address second-
hand smoke transfer by prohibiting smoking in all indoor areas,
and — with a stronger policy — all outdoor areas too. Few stud-
ies have investigated the effects of smoke-free policies in multi-
unit housing on secondhand smoke exposure and quit attempts,
but evaluations of other smoke-free indoor policies are promising.
For example, smoke-free workplace policies are effective at redu-
cing exposure to secondhand smoke (15,16). These policies also
appear to decrease cigarette smoking and promote smoking cessa-
tion. One study found that smokers who worked in environments
that implemented a smoke-free workplace policy were nearly
twice as likely to quit as workers without a smoke-free workplace
policy, and those who continued smoking reported a significant re-
duction in number of cigarettes smoked daily (17).
Findings from these studies suggest that policies prohibiting
smoking in multi-unit affordable housing could help decrease to-
bacco use and secondhand smoke exposure among residents and
consequently reduce socioeconomic tobacco-related health dispar-
ities (18). However, little is known about the effects of smoke-free
housing policies on smoking and secondhand smoke exposure
among low-income populations. To our knowledge, only 2 studies
have examined this issue with a focus on low-income residents,
and these studies were limited by the use of retrospective self-re-
ports of pre-policy smoking (14) and a policy that included indef-
inite grandfathering (ie, allowing smokers residing in the apart-
ment at the time the policy was implemented to continue smoking
in their units) (19). A recent review noted the shortage of research
on smoking and secondhand smoke exposure in affordable hous-
ing and called for more prospective studies on the effect of smoke-
free housing policies on residents’ smoking behavior (20). The
purpose of our study was to determine the effects of smoke-free
policies in multi-unit housing on secondhand smoke exposure and
tobacco use among low-income populations.
Methods
Eight public housing properties participated in a longitudinal
pretest–posttest evaluation. The properties were from 4 regions of
Minnesota and comprised a mix of urban and rural communities
(population range: 1,700–86,000). A large proportion of residents
at participating properties were seniors. The smoke-free policies
implemented at each property prohibited smoking in all indoor
areas; 3 of the properties also prohibited smoking on all outdoor
grounds. Residents were notified of the smoke-free policy between
3 and 12 months prior to implementation. Policies were imple-
mented with the assistance of the staff of the local public health
department and with the support of the Statewide Health Improve-
ment Program, a grant program that focuses on increasing physic-
al activity and healthy eating, and reducing tobacco use and expos-
ure to secondhand smoke in Minnesota. Sites were recruited with
the help of staff members of the local public health department,
who helped identify properties that had agreed to implement a
smoke-free multi-unit housing policy. Residents were recruited via
flyers posted on bulletin boards at each site. The Minnesota De-
partment of Health institutional review board approved the study.
Time 1 (pretest) data were collected at each site one month before
implementation of the smoke-free multi-unit housing policy (from
February 2014 through March 2015), and Time 2 (posttest) data
were collected 6 months postimplementation (from September
2014 through October 2015). Time 1 surveys were distributed
door to door to all residents in participating buildings. Time 2 sur-
veys were distributed only to Time 1 respondents who still lived at
the site. Sites could choose from 2 compensation options for parti-

 cipants. Five sites chose to have participants receive a $15 gift
card for completing the Time 1 survey and a $20 gift card for
completing the Time 2 survey. The other 3 sites chose to do ran-
dom drawings for several $50 gift cards at both Time 1 and Time
2. Smoking cessation resources were offered to all resident
smokers before policy implementation.
A total of 578 residents received a Time 1 survey, and 289 resid-
ents completed it (50% response rate). Of these 289 residents, 25
moved out before the Time 2 survey. Of the remaining 264 Time 1
respondents, 180 (62.3%) also completed a Time 2 survey, yield-
ing a 68.2% response rate at Time 2 and a 62.3% retention rate.
The Time 1 survey assessed secondhand smoke exposure, cigar-
ette smoking, quit attempts, and participant demographics. The
Time 2 survey was identical to the Time 1 survey, except for addi-
tional items assessing smoking cessation methods and reasons for
reducing smoking or trying to quit. Demographic characteristics
collected were age, race/ethnicity, highest level of education (1 =
less than high school degree, 2 = high school graduate or general
equivalency degree, 3 = some college, associate degree or voca-
tional,  technical,  or business school, 4 = bachelor degree or high-
er, 5 = PhD, MD, JD, or other professional degree), and annual
household income (1 = ≤$10,000, 2 = $10,001-$20,000, 3 =
$20,001-$25,000, 4 = $25,001-$35,000, 5 = $35,001-$50,000, 6 =
$50,001-$75,000,  7 = ≥$75,000). Questions related to second-
hand smoke assessed both indoor and outdoor exposure. For in-
door exposure, participants were asked 1) how often they smelled
or breathed secondhand smoke when inside their own apartments
and 2) how often they smelled or breathed secondhand smoke in
shared areas such as hallways, stairwells, community rooms, or
laundry rooms. For outdoor exposure, they were asked how often
they smelled or breathed secondhand smoke in parking lots, lawns,
or playgrounds. Responses for indoor and outdoor exposure were
rated on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = never, 2 = hardly ever, 3 = a few
times a month, 4 = a few times a week, 5 = every day). Responses
to the 2 indoor exposure questions were aggregated to form an in-
door exposure scale (α = .74). Smoking status was assessed by
asking if residents had smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime (yes
or no) and if they currently smoked cigarettes (responses: every
day, some days, not at all). Participants were classified as current
smokers if they reported smoking 100 cigarettes during their life-
time and currently smoked cigarettes “some days” or “every day.”
Residents’ quit attempts were assessed by asking whether in the
past 6 months they had stopped smoking for one day or longer be-
cause they were trying to quit (yes or no). In the Time 2 survey,
participants were asked if the amount they smoked changed in the
past 6 months (responses: smoked more, smoked less, smoked
about the same, quit smoking). Smokers who had reduced their
smoking or had tried to quit in the past 6 months were asked their
primary reasons for doing so (responses were family reasons,
health, cost, or inconvenience [ie, not allowed to smoke in their
apartments]; residents could choose more than one response).
Data were analyzed with SPSS version 22.0 (Stata Corp LP); sig-
nificance was set at P < .05. Independent sample t tests were used
to identify differences in demographics between residents lost to
follow-up between the Time 1 and Time 2 surveys and those who
were retained. Time 1 to Time 2 changes in nonsmokers’ reported
indoor and outdoor exposure to secondhand smoke were ex-
amined by using repeated-measures ANOVAs. These analyses
were followed by another repeated-measures ANOVA to test for
differences in secondhand smoke exposure outdoors among sites
that did not prohibit smoking outdoors. Differences in quit at-
tempts from Time 1 to Time 2 were tested using McNemar’s test.
Results
Demographic characteristics of participants retained at Time 2
were not significantly different from those lost to follow-up, ex-
cept for race/ethnicity, education, and income (Table). Among
those retained at Time 2, race, education, and income were not sig-
nificantly related to the outcomes of interest (all P > .05).
The final sample of 180 was 68% female, 73% white, 23% black,
and had a mean age of 63 years (range: 21–99). The proportion of
current smokers at Time 1 was 15%. Twenty-nine percent of the
sample had less than a high school education, 82% had less than a
bachelor’s degree, and 72.5% earned $20,000 a year or less.
A repeated-measures ANOVA indicated a significant decrease in
nonsmokers’ reported exposure to secondhand smoke indoors
from Time 1 (44.0%) to Time 2 (23.6%), F1,144 = 22.69, P < .001
(Figure). Conversely, there was no significant difference from
Time 1 to Time 2 in outdoor secondhand smoke exposure, F(1,140)
= 2.17, P = .14. Follow-up analyses tested for a difference in out-
door secondhand smoke exposure among nonsmokers living in
properties that did not prohibit smoking outdoors (n = 119). Res-
ults revealed a marginally significant increase in outdoor second-
hand smoke exposure from Time 1 to Time 2, F(1,118) = 3.76, P =
.055 (Figure).

Results from McNemar’s test indicated no significant difference in
the proportion of smokers who reported making a quit attempt in
the past 6 months at Time 1 (77.8%) and Time 2 (63.0%), P > .05.
At Time 2, 77% of smokers reported reducing the amount that
they smoked in the past 6 months, and an additional 5% reported
that they had quit. Those who had quit, tried to quit, or reduced the
amount they had smoked in the past 6 months reported their reas-
ons for doing so at Time 2. The most commonly cited reasons for
quitting, trying to quit, or reducing smoking were inconvenience
attributable to not being able to smoke in the apartment (52%) and
health (52%). The next most common reasons were cost (40%)
and family (25%).
Discussion
Results of this study suggest that smoke-free policies in afford-
able multi-unit housing can reduce residents’ exposure to second-
hand indoor smoke. This finding is consistent with that of Piza-
cani and colleagues (14), who found that frequent secondhand
smoke exposure inside apartments dropped from 41% to 17% after
implementation of a smoke-free policy. Although indoor exposure
to secondhand smoke decreased significantly from Time 1 to Time
2, 23.6% of residents reported secondhand smoke exposure at least
a few times per month after the policy, suggesting enforcement
and compliance issues. Lack of compliance with the policy can
undermine health benefits associated with smoke-free housing.
Future studies should use long-term follow-up surveys to examine
whether compliance issues diminish over time and also conduct
landlord interviews to investigate resident complaints and enforce-
ment practices.
Analyses examining changes in outdoor exposure to secondhand
smoke showed no difference from Time 1 to Time 2 for all
nonsmokers. However, further analyses indicated a marginal in-
crease in outdoor secondhand smoke exposure among nonsmokers
living in properties that did not restrict smoking outdoors. These
findings suggest that secondhand smoke exposure may increase in
locations not covered by the smoke-free policy after its imple-
mentation. The observed increase in outdoor secondhand smoke
exposure may be due to smokers obeying the smoke-free policy
but smoking in locations that are unavoidable by nonsmoking res-
idents (eg, outside the front entryway, in the parking lot). These
findings highlight the importance of implementing comprehensive
smoke-free policies that cover all property grounds rather than in-
doors only.
There was no change in quit attempts in the past 6 months from
Time 1 to Time 2. Residents were informed well in advance of the
implementation date — 6 months or more, in most cases — that
the smoke-free policy would be implemented. Therefore, resid-
ents may have attempted to quit smoking before the implementa-
tion date in anticipation of the policy going into effect, resulting in
an inflated number of baseline quit attempts. The proportion of
smokers who made a quit attempt in the 6 months before imple-
mentation (77.8%) was substantially greater than the proportion of
smokers in the general population who are seniors (mean age was
63 in the current study) and made a quit attempt in the past 12
months (38.8%) (1). Future studies should assess quit attempts be-
fore residents are informed about a forthcoming smoke-free policy
to establish baseline quit attempts.
The percentage of Time 1 smokers who successfully quit smoking
at Time 2 (4.5%) was comparable to previous estimates of the an-
nual quit rate for smokers in the general population in the absence
of an intervention (2.6%) (14), suggesting that the policy did not
substantially increase quitting. These findings are inconsistent
with a recent evaluation of smoke-free multi-unit housing policies
among low-income residents that found a quit rate of 22.1% post
implementation; however, this quit rate was observed 18 months
following implementation of the smoke-free policy, a follow-up
period 3 times as long as in this study (14). Although quitting
smoking did not increase in our study, most smokers (77%) did re-
port reducing the amount that they smoked at the 6-month follow
up, a figure that is substantially greater than that found in the Piza-
cani et al study (49%) (14). This finding suggests that, although

 residents were not more apt to make a quit attempt or successfully
quit smoking, they did reduce their smoking. Residents may have
planned to reduce the amount they smoked before making a quit
attempt with the hope that they would increase their chances of
success. Previous research has found that, although the health be-
nefits of reducing smoking are modest to negligible (21–23), redu-
cing smoking is predictive of later cessation among smokers who
are motivated to quit (24).  Thus, it is conceivable that many
smoking residents were in the early stages of quitting at the Time
2 assessment. Long-term follow-ups with multiple assessments are
needed to test this hypothesis.
Among Time 1 smokers who had quit, tried to quit, or reduced the
amount that they smoked at Time 2, the most commonly cited
reason for changing their smoking behavior was the inconveni-
ence of not being allowed to smoke in their apartment. Having to
go outside or off property grounds to smoke — a direct result of a
smoke-free housing policy — was enough of a deterrent that resid-
ents reported smoking less after the policy was implemented. This
finding has implications for cessation interventions, because in-
convenience was cited as frequently as health, and more so than
other frequently targeted cessation motivations, such as familial
concerns and the high cost of smoking.
A limitation of this study was that we did not measure the number
of cigarettes smoked at Time 1 and Time 2. Results suggested a
reduction in smoking from Time 1 to Time 2, but it is possible that
residents knew the study was focused on smoking behavior and re-
sponded in a socially desirable way — by reporting that they were
smoking less than they actually were after the policy. Future stud-
ies should include objective measures of smoking (eg, blood cotin-
ine) and smoking reduction measures that assess reduction by 50%
or more to facilitate comparison with other smoking interventions
(25,26). Second, we had no control group in this study, which lim-
its inferences about causality. For example, a substantial propor-
tion of smokers reported reduced smoking at Time 2, but the lack
of a control group made it difficult to determine whether this ef-
fect was significant. Post hoc 1-sample t tests were conducted to
test whether the proportion of smokers who quit or reduced their
smoking at Time 2 (82%) was significantly different from the pro-
portion of smokers in the general population who made a quit at-
tempt in the past year (ie, stopped smoking for 1 day or longer
when trying to quit [38.8%]) (1). Results of this test did indicate a
significant difference (P < .001); however, larger studies that in-
clude a valid comparison group (eg, affordable housing residents
living in buildings that have not implemented a smoke-free policy)
are needed to corroborate these findings. Third, a convenience
sample composed primarily of senior residents was used; there-
fore, results may not generalize to other affordable housing popu-
lations. Fourth, this study did not assess whether smokers changed
where they smoked post implementation. These data would have
provided more insight into the observed effects on indoor and out-
door secondhand smoke exposure and should be collected in fu-
ture studies.
Populations of low socioeconomic status have disproportionately
high rates of smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke (3,5,6).
Results from this study suggest that smoke-free multi-unit hous-
ing policies in affordable housing properties could reduce second-
hand smoke exposure and cigarette smoking among low-income
populations. Although more research is needed to investigate
strategies to address compliance and enforcement issues, imple-
menting smoke-free multi-unit housing policies in affordable
housing may be a promising step toward eliminating tobacco-re-
lated disparities.
