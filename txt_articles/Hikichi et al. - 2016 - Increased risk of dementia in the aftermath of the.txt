No previous study has been able to examine the association by
taking account of risk factors for dementia before and after the
disaster. We prospectively examined whether experiences of a
disaster were associated with cognitive decline in the aftermath of
the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. The baseline
for our natural experiment was established in a survey of older
community-dwelling adults who lived 80 km west of the epicenter
7 mo before the earthquake and tsunami. Approximately 2.5 y after
the disaster, the follow-up survey gathered information about
personal experiences of disaster as well as incidence of dementia
from 3,594 survivors (82.1% follow-up rate). Our primary outcome
was dementia diagnosis ascertained by in-home assessment during
the follow-up period. Among our analytic sample (n = 3,566), 38.0%
reported losing relatives or friends in the disaster, and 58.9%
reported property damage. Fixed-effects regression indicated that
major housing damage and home destroyed were associated with
cognitive decline: regression coefficient for levels of dementia symp-
toms = 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01 to 0.23 and coeffi-
cient = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.40, respectively. The effect size of
destroyed home is comparable to the impact of incident stroke (co-
efficient = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.36). The association between
housing damage and cognitive decline remained statistically signif-
icant in the instrumental variable analysis. Housing damage appears
to be an important risk factor for cognitive decline among older
survivors in natural disasters.

U
p to two-thirds of the affected populations in the 2011 Great
East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami were older residents who
were 60 y old or older (1). Recovery after major disaster poses a
unique set of challenges for the elderly population, including dis-
ruption of medical care for preexisting conditions, preexisting
functional limitations that impede recovery, and social isolation in
the aftermath of housing loss and resettlement. A particular con-
cern for older survivors is the potential risks of cognitive decline. In
the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, an estimated 340,000 residents
were displaced as a result of widespread destruction to residential
properties. In turn, as a direct consequence of residential dislocation
and resettlement in unfamiliar surroundings, many seniors experi-
enced disorientation that could hasten cognitive decline (2). Psy-
chological trauma, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
symptoms (3) and the onset of depression (4), may have additionally
contributed to this risk.
Two years after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and
Tsunami, a cross-sectional study found that 36.0% of seniors who
moved to temporary housing in Kesen-numa city were suffering from
dementia symptoms (5). Another cross-sectional study of seniors
affected by the disaster reported that 47.9% showed signs of mild
cognitive impairment, and an additional 16.0% of respondents were
diagnosed as having dementia (6). However, prospective studies of
risk factors for cognitive decline in the aftermath of disaster remain
extremely scarce. This scarcity is particularly true for risk factors that
predate the disaster. Asking about predisaster conditions after the
disaster is obviously subject to recall bias.
In the present study, we took advantage of a unique “natural
experiment” in which information about health status was gathered
7 mo before the disaster. Our study area, Iwanuma city, located
∼80 km west of the earthquake epicenter (Fig. 1), was one of the
field sites of a cohort study of aging established in 2010. The Japan
Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES) inquired about the
health status, health behaviors, and social determinants of healthy
aging in a nationwide sample of community-dwelling residents aged
65 y or older. Approximately 2.5 y after the disaster, we recontacted
the 3,594 survivors (Fig. 2) and linked their responses to incident
dementia symptoms ascertained by in-home assessment and med-
ical examination under Japan’s national Long-Term Care Insur-
ance (LTCI) registry (Table S1). This unique design afforded us
the opportunity to prospectively examine the association between
disaster-related experiences and postdisaster cognitive decline.
Results
Table 1 presents the characteristics of respondents at baseline
(before the disaster) and at follow-up 2.5 y later. Females made up
56.5% of respondents, and this proportion was very close to the
actual local census of older residents in Iwanuma city in October
2010 (male 42.8%, female 57.2%) (7). The age distribution of our
sample was close to the local census data, except for the group
aged 85 y and over (respondents 6.2%, census data 13.2%) (7). A
somewhat higher proportion of our respondents were married
(71.4%) compared with the census data (64.7%) (8). The pro-
portion of employed individuals in our data (17.8%) was also quite
Significance
Recovery after major disaster poses potential risks of dementia
for the elderly population. However, no previous studies have
examined exposure to natural disaster and changes in risk factors
as predictors of deterioration in cognitive function. We prospec-
tively examined whether housing damage and loss of relatives or
friends were associated with cognitive decline in the aftermath of
the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. In this study,
which included 3,566 survivors who are 65 y old or older, the
severity of housing damage was significantly associated with
cognitive decline after controlling changes of covariates and risk
factors during the follow-up period. The cognitive decline should
be listed as a health risk of older survivors in the aftermath of
natural disasters.

 close to the census data (17.2%) (9). Our study population was
less likely to be domiciled in households with four or more people
compared with the census data (respondents 31.5%, census data
53.3%) (10). The proportion of individuals who were assessed to
be cognitively independent was also higher in our analytic sample
compared with the general older population in Iwanuma city
(95.9% in our sample vs. 86.5% in the census data). These dif-
ferences are likely a result of the fact that our sample was healthier
than the general population and less likely to be living together with
other caregivers (e.g., adult children).
In addition, we also compared the characteristics of our ana-
lytic sample versus nonrespondents to the follow-up survey (n =
786). The sex distribution was similar, although our analytic
sample was somewhat older than the nonrespondents (Table S2).
The proportion of married persons in our analytic sample
(71.4%) was higher than among nonrespondents (64.9%). More
respondents were likely to be used at the time of the follow-up
survey (17.8%) compared with the nonrespondents (14.0%). The
nonrespondents were also less classified as functionally inde-
pendent (84.1%) compared with the analytic sample (95.9%).
These comparisons support that our data almost represents whole
older population in Iwanuma city (Table S2).
Among the respondents, 38.0% reported losing relatives or
friends in the disaster, whereas 58.9% reported personal damage
to their property (see further description of property damage in
Table S3). The prevalence of respondents whose cognitive function
was classified as nonindependent at the follow-up survey (11.5%)
was three times higher than at baseline (4.1%). The prevalence of
stroke (2.8%) and hypertension (54.0%) had also increased at the
follow-up survey (to 6.5% and 57.2%, respectively). The preva-
lence of individuals who reported not interacting with their neigh-
bors (not even greetings) nearly doubled over the 3-y follow-up
(1.5 to 2.9%). The proportion of respondents with severe PTSD
symptoms at follow-up was 11.4%.
As shown in Table 2, model 1 indicated that major housing
damage and destroyed home was significantly associated with de-
terioration of dementia symptomatology: coefficient for levels of
dementia symptoms (out of an eight-point scale) = 0.12, 95%
confidence interval (CI): 0.01 to 0.23 for “major damage”; and
coefficient = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.40, for “destroyed.” In con-
trast, loss of relatives or friends did not show a significant associ-
ation with cognitive impairment (coefficient = −0.03, 95% CI:
−0.07 to 0.02).
Model 2 added the potential mediators. The onset of depression
(coefficient = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.17) and lack of interactions
with neighbors (coefficient = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.14) were
significant. The addition of these mediators attenuated the rela-
tionship between levels of property damage and deterioration of
dementia symptomatology (model 3). The most influential medi-
ator was the new onset of depressive symptoms when we adjusted
for one mediator at a time. The sensitivity analyses using the result
of medical examination also showed same results (Table S4).
Finally, we combined instrumental variable analysis with our
fixed-effects approach. The first stage F-statistics (329.48) suggested
that distance from coast is a strong instrument (Fig. S1) (11). The
residual of the first-stage regression in our instrumental variable
analysis is significant in the second-stage regression (P = 0.02),
suggesting that housing damage is endogenous (12). In addition, the
inverse distance from the coast was not directly associated with
cognitive decline after adjusting for all covariates (coefficient =
0.08, 95% CI: −0.01 to 0.17), suggesting that the exclusion restric-
tion was met. We therefore used distance from the coast as a valid
instrumental variable for housing damage and dementia. As shown
in Table 3, our instrumental variable analysis also suggests that
property damage is significantly associated with deterioration in
dementia symptomatology. The sensitivity analyses for medical
examination were also showed same results (Table S5).
Discussion
This study demonstrates that experiences of disaster are associ-
ated with the deterioration of dementia symptomatology, con-
trolling changes of covariates and risk factors in a natural
experimental setting. The associations remained after statistically
controlling for observed and unobserved time-invariant personal
traits as well as change of several risk factors for dementia before
and after the disaster. The strength of the associations between
property damage and dementia symptoms appears to be statis-
tically and clinically important. For example, the impact on de-
mentia symptoms following complete destruction of the housing

 (coefficient = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.40 in model 1 of Table 2) is
comparable to the impact of incident stroke (coefficient = 0.24,
95% CI: 0.11 to 0.36). Additionally, the loss of housing is close to
the 3-y decline in cognitive function in our sample (coefficient =
0.32, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.37). We confirmed that the association
between housing damage and cognitive decline was significant in
sensitivity analysis that the outcome was the result of medical
examination. In addition, the results of the instrumental variable
analysis with the fixed-effect model also showed the significant
association. Therefore, the effect of housing damage on cognitive
decline is a robust finding.
Previous studies have hinted that experiences of the 2011
Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami are linked with
heightened risk of cognitive decline (5, 6, 13–15). In the United
States, Cherry et al. showed that short-term and working-memory
performance was adversely affected in the aftermath of Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita (16). At an additional follow-up examination
6–14 mo after the disaster, the respondent’s working-memory
performance had recovered from the prior survey (17). However,
Cherry et al. (16, 17) did not specifically examine the effects of
housing damage or other risk factors for cognitive decline pre-
dating the disaster.
There are plausible mechanisms linking property damage to
cognitive function of older people, including: (i) new onset of
depression and (ii) disruption of social contacts. Our mediation
analysis (model 3) indicated that depression and loss of interac-
tions with neighbors partially mediated the relation between
property damage and cognitive decline.
In contrast to experiences of property damage, the loss of rela-
tives or friends was not significantly associated with cognitive de-
cline. We also checked the endogeneity of loss of relatives or friends
by using residence in the tsunami-inundated area as our instrument.
The proportion of respondents who lost relatives or friends in the
inundated area (60.9%) was approximately twice as high as those
who lived in noninundated areas (33.9%), F-statistics = 19.97.
However, the instrumental variable analysis indicated that loss of
relatives/friends was not significantly associated with cognitive de-
cline (coefficient = 0.07; 95% CI: −0.15 to 0.29). However, we did
not inquire on the baseline survey about the frequency of social
interactions between the survivors and the relatives/friends who

 were lost. Some of them may have interacted with the survivors on a
daily basis before the disaster, in which case their loss could have
contributed to risk of cognitive decline.
A major strength of this study is the availability of information
predating the disaster about levels of dementia symptomatology,
as well as other health conditions. Our design was therefore able
to effectively address the problem of recall bias in most studies
conducted in postdisaster settings. A second strength is the record
linkage to medically verified dementia symptomatology obtained
through home visits.
Despite our attempts to control for major confounding factors,
we cannot exclude the possibility that housing damage was en-
dogenous; that is, people at risk for cognitive decline were also
more likely to be living in vulnerable housing. For example,
lower educational attainment and equivalent income were both
correlated with severity of housing damage (Tables S6 and S7).
Even though we controlled for education and income, there may
be other residual confounding factors. Thus, it was important to
demonstrate that the same association between property damage
and dementia symptomatology was observed in our instrumental
variable analysis.
Selection bias might have arisen because of the 59% response
rate to the baseline survey. However, this response rate is quite
comparable to similar surveys involving community-dwelling resi-
dents (18). In addition, we confirmed that the demographic profile
of our participants is quite similar to the rest of Iwanuma residents
aged 65 y or older (Table S2). Furthermore, the response rate of
our follow-up survey among survivors was quite high (82.1%).
Because of the compulsory residential registration system in Japan,
only 17 residents from the baseline sample could not be tracked
(Fig. 2). The estimated effects from the instrumental variable
model were larger than the fixed-effects model. This difference
may be because of the correction of measurement error associated
with the assessment of housing damage that was obtained by self-
report (19). At the same time, we also note that the extent of
housing damage was not just based on subjective perception, but
based on two independent assessors dispatched to each damaged
house. In addition, our findings likely underestimated the impact
of this large-scale disaster on the dementia risk of survivors. That
is, even among survivors whose homes were not inundated or
destroyed, they may still be at increased risk of cognitive decline
because of other trauma experiences (e.g., depression).

 We demonstrated that experiences of housing damage are as-
sociated with deterioration of dementia symptomatology. Cognitive
decline should be added to the list of health risks faced by older
survivors of disaster.
Methods
Study Participants. JAGES is a nationwide cohort study established in 2010 to
examine prospectively the predictors of healthy aging. A total of 169,215
community-dwelling people aged 65 y or older in 31 municipalities were mailed
a baseline questionnaire, and 112,123 individuals responded to the invitation
(response rate 66.3%) (20).
One of the field sites of the JAGES cohort is based in the city of Iwanuma
(total population 44,187 in 2010) (7) in Miyagi Prefecture. We mailed ques-
tionnaires to all residents aged 65 y or older in August 2010 (n = 8,576), using
the official residential register. The survey inquired about personal charac-
teristics as well as their health status. The response rate was 59.0% (n = 5,058),
which is comparable to other surveys of community-dwelling residents.
The earthquake and tsunami occurred on March 11, 2011, 7 mo after the
baseline survey was completed. Iwanuma city is a coastal municipality located
∼80 km west of the earthquake epicenter, so that it was in the direct line of
the tsunami that killed 180 residents, damaged 5,542 homes, and inundated
48% of the land area (Fig. 1) (21).
Approximately 2.5 y after the disaster (starting on October 2013), we
conducted a follow-up survey of all survivors. The survey gathered infor-
mation about personal experiences of disaster as well as updating their
health status. Informed consent was obtained at the time of survey collection.
The respondents were then linked to the national LTCI registry, which in-
cludes information about dementia symptomatology based on in-home as-
sessment by trained investigators (e.g., public health nurse).
The detailed flow-chart of the analytic sample is presented in Fig. 2. Of the
4,380 eligible participants from the baseline survey, we managed to recontact
3,594 individuals (follow-up rate: 82.1%). Our analytic sample is 3,566 because
of incompletely signed informed consent forms and lack of linkage to the
national LTCI database.
The survey protocol was reviewed and approved by the human subjects
committee of the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, as well as the
human subjects committees of Tohoku University, Nihon Fukushi University,
and Chiba University. In principle, outside researchers can access the data of
JAGES upon request, as per NIH data access policies. We would require the
applicant to submit an analysis proposal that would be reviewed by an internal
committee of JAGES investigators to avoid duplication. We are not able to

 deposit our data for public sharing because the data are from an ongoing
cohort study of community-dwelling individuals (a one in six sample of a
midsize town), and we need to protect their confidentiality.
Outcome Variable. Our primary outcome is dementia symptomatology assessed
by a standardized in-home assessment. The Japanese government established a
national LTCI scheme in 2000 (22). Under the LTCI, a certification committee in
each municipality dispatches a trained investigator to an applicants’ home to
evaluate their eligibility for elderly care (e.g., home helpings).
During the home visit, the individual is assessed with regard to their activities
of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living status, cognitive
function (e.g., short-term memory, orientation, and communication), as well as
mental and behavioral disorders (e.g., delusions of persecution, confabulation,
and soliloquy) using a standardized protocol. Following the assessment, the
applicants are classified into one of eight levels according to the severity of
their cognitive disability (Table S1). The index of dementia symptomatology is
strongly correlated with the Mini Mental State Examination (Spearman’s rank
correlation ρ = −0.73, P < 0.001) (23), and the level I of dementia symptom-
atology has been demonstrated to correspond with a 0.5 point rating on the
Clinical Dementia Rating (specificity and sensitivity 0.88, respectively) (24). The
initial certification is valid for 6 mo, after which periodic reassessments are
generally conducted every 12 mo (25). The certified persons can require the
reassessment before the expiration date, when their health status radically
changes (22).
The certification committee also asks physicians to assess the cognitive dis-
ability level of applicants to refer an expert’s opinion when they decide the care
level of the applicants (26). The medical examination is independent of the
investigator’s in-home assessment, but we confirmed a high correlation be-
tween changes of dementia level of both assessment (Pearson’s correlation γ =
0.80, P < 0.001). We used the medical examination in our sensitivity analyses.
We linked JAGES cohort participants to the LTCI register in Iwanuma city for
the follow-up period from April 1, 2010 to January 24, 2014. These data includes
the results of the initial assessment as well as subsequent reassessments for
each individual.
Explanatory Variables. Our primary exposure variable of interest is personal
experiences of trauma in the disaster: housing damage as well as loss of relatives
or friends.
The question about housing damage is based on objectively established
criteria for the purposes of compensation of victims. Two or more technical
officers surveyed the properties and classified the extent of damage into five
levels: (i) “no damage,” (ii) “partial damage,” (iii) “minor,” (iv) “major,” and
(v) “destroyed” (Table S3).
Covariates and Mediators. We selected as potential time-varying confounding
variables: age, equivalized income (27), medical treatment for stroke, hyper-
tension, diabetes (28), dyslipidemia (29), current smoking (30), current alcohol
drinking (31), and daily walking time (32). Other time invariant characteristics,
such as sex and educational attainment, were omitted from our fixed-effects
regressions (33). We also controlled for length of time (in years) between the
predisaster and postdisaster assessments for each subject (mean 3.69, SD 0.38).
We additionally examined a set of variables as potential mediators of the
relation between property damage/loss and dementia symptomatology. These
variables were included: disruption to access to internal medicine and psychiatric
services, incident PTSD and depression symptoms (measured by the Geriatric
Depression Scale-15, GDS-15) (4), and declines in informal social interactions
with friends and neighbors. The informal socializing variable was measured in
terms of the reported frequency of meeting with friends, ranging from “four or
more times a week” to “rarely.” Interactions with neighbors was asked in terms
of how close the respondents felt to their neighbors, ranging from “mutual
consultation, lending and borrowing of daily commodities, cooperation in daily
life” to “none, not even greeting their neighbors.” PTSD symptoms were
assessed using the Screening Questionnaire for Disaster-Related Mental Health
(34), which has been previously validated in an older Japanese population. PTSD
symptoms were categorized into slightly affected (0–3 points), moderately af-
fected (4–5 points), and severely affected (6–9 points) (34).
Age was grouped into “65 to 74 y,” “74 to 84 y,” and “85 y and over.”
Household income was equalized by dividing the gross income by the square
root of the number of household members and categorized into “Under 2.0
million JPY” (Japanese yen) versus “2.0 million JPY and over.” Depressive
symptoms were categorized into lower risk (four points and under) versus
higher risk (five points and over) (35).
Statistical Analysis. In the present study, we used a fixed-effects regression
approach to examine the associations between property damage and changes
in dementia symptomatology over time. In the case of two-wave panel data,
the model is equivalent to a first-difference model (36). That is, the model
estimates within-individual changes in the dependent variable (△Y: change in
level of dementia symptomatology) regressed on changes in the independent
variable (△X: experiences of disaster damage), which effectively differences
out the confounding influences of all observed and unobserved time-invariant
factors. The causal interpretation of this model can still be questioned if
changes in the outcome influenced changes in the exposure. However, in our
natural experiment, we argue that the exposure itself (i.e., experiences of the
disaster) was an exogenous shock, and that the resulting coefficients can be
interpreted as causal.
Property damage in a disaster is a potentially endogenous variable; that is,
residents who are more susceptible to cognitive decline may be also more likely
to be living in homes that are vulnerable to damage. We need to reduce the
estimation bias caused by the endogeneity of housing damage after adjusting
observed covariates and risk factors. Therefore, as a robustness check to account
for residual confounding, we additionally conducted an instrumental variable
analysis, using the inverse of distance from the coastline to each resident’s
address at baseline as an instrument for housing damage. A valid instrument
requires that it be associated with the treatment, but not directly affect the
outcome (37). We calculated the distance for each residence using geographic
information systems. The extent of housing damage was strongly correlated
with distance from the coast (Fig. S1).
To address potential bias resulting from missing data, we used multiple
imputation by Markov chain–Monte Carlo method assuming missingness at
random for explanatory variables and covariates. We created 50 imputed
datasets and combined each result of analysis using the STATA command
“mi estimate.”
All analyses were performed using STATA v14.0 (STATA).
