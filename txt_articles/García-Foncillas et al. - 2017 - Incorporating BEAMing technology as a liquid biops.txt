The importance of mutation identification for advanced colorectal cancer treatment with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor
agents is well established. However, due to delays in turnaround time, low-quality tissue samples, and/or lack of standardization
of testing methods a significant proportion of patients are being treated without the information that Kirsten rat sarcoma and
neuroblastoma rat sarcoma (RAS) testing can provide. The detection of mutated circulating tumor DNA by BEAMing technology
addresses this gap in care and allows these patients to receive international guideline-recommended expanded RAS testing
with rapid turnaround times. Furthermore, the overall concordance between OncoBEAM RAS colorectal cancer testing and
standard of care tissue testing is very high (93.3%). This article presents an overview of the clinical utility and potential
applications of this minimally invasive method, such as early detection of emergent resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor
receptor therapy. If appropriately implemented, BEAMing technology holds considerable promise to enhance the quality of
patient care and improve clinical outcomes.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed
neoplasm and the third leading cause of cancer death in the
United States [1], whereas it is the most common cause of cancer
death after lung cancer in Europe [2]. Approximately one-quar-
ter of patients with CRC present with metastatic disease (mCRC)
at diagnosis (synchronous disease), and �40% of patients
develop metachronous metastases after treatment, contributing
to the high mortality rate associated with this disease. Systemic
therapy is the mainstay of treatment for mCRC, and there are
currently several approved drugs for the management of mCRC,
which include chemotherapy agents, small molecules, and mono-
clonal antibodies.
Anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted thera-
pies, such as cetuximab and panitumumab, do not have universal
efficacy. In mCRC, there is a high frequency of Kirsten rat
sarcoma (KRAS) viral oncogene homolog mutations, which are
responsible for resistance to these monoclonal antibodies [3].
Traditionally, prescribing anti-EGFR therapy required assess-
ment of mutations in KRAS Exon 2, which occur in �40% of pa-
tients. Additional research has expanded the spectrum mutations
in KRAS and neuroblastoma RAS (NRAS) viral oncogene homo-
log genes that predict a lack of efficacy to these treatments,
including mutations in KRAS exon 3 (codons 59 and 61) and
exon 4 (codons 117 and 146) and mutations in NRAS exons 2, 3,
and 4 [4–8]. Accordingly, clinical practice guidelines in the

 United States and Europe have been updated to reflect the need
for broader RAS testing, in order to refine the most appropriate
patient population to receive anti-EGFR therapy [9–11].
Molecular analysis of genomic alterations has been tradition-
ally performed on archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
(FFPE), but this procedure entails limitations in terms of poor
quality of the extracted DNA and lack of standardization of test-
ing methods. Moreover, tumor heterogeneity and clonal molecu-
lar evolution throughout therapy confound tissue sampling and
there is no consensus as to whether analysis of the primary tumor
is sufficient or whether a metastatic lesion should be studied in
patients with metastases [12–14]. As recurring tissue biopsies are
not routinely performed in patients with advanced, the use of
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to detect tumor-specific muta-
tions has emerged as an important tool to inform clinical
decisions according to tumor dynamics. This procedure is often
referred to as a ‘liquid biopsy’ and represents an attractive strat-
egy for better patient selection and treatment individualization
throughout multiple lines of therapy [15].
Concept and methodological features of
liquid biopsy
Liquid biopsy allows the analysis of several blood-based bio-
markers, i.e. circulating tumor cells, protein molecules, mRNA,
microRNA, and cell-free DNA. Methodological limitations seem
to be more important for CTCs than for cell-free circulating nu-
cleic acids [16]. In fact, circulating DNA has been investigated for
decades as a potential marker for screening, diagnosis, prognosis,
and monitoring treatment response. Indeed, the release of DNA
into the bloodstream from apoptotic or necrotic tumor cells has
been reported in different neoplasms [17–19]. Bettegowda et al.
showed that the frequency of cases with detectable ctDNA was
proportional to the stage of the disease. Although ctDNA was de-
tected in 100% of patients with stage IV malignancies including
colorectal, bladder, and ovarian cancer the rate of detection of
ctDNA in early-stage malignancies was �50% [20]. They also
compared the quantities of ctDNA and CTCs in the same blood
sample from patients with solid tumors and showed that the level
of ctDNA was always higher than that of CTCs. In 13 of 16
patients, ctDNA levels were relatively high, whereas no CTCs
at all could be detected [20].
One of the main advantages of ctDNA analyses is its high degree
of specificity, since somatic mutations found in ctDNA are not
present in normal cell-free DNA. However, the analysis of ctDNA
is challenging and requires highly sensitive techniques. Advances
in the pre-analytical stage can improve the performance of ctDNA
detection, for example ctDNA should be extracted from plasma
rather than serum due to its lower concentration of background
wild-type DNA in plasma [21]. After years of investigation there
are now several methods for detecting ctDNA, and platforms pri-
marily based on digital PCR and next-generation sequencing
(NGS) are widely used, though each has inherent advantages and
disadvantages in terms of sensitivity, specificity, throughput, and
breadth of mutational coverage (Table 1). Readers interested in
further details on the principles and different characteristics of
these techniques are invited to consult the following recent review
[22]. Among them, an emulsion PCR-based technology platform
known as BEAMing (Beads, Emulsions, Amplification, and
Magnetics) is the first liquid biopsy test that has been clinically
validated [20, 23–26] and is CE Mark’d (OncoBEAM RAS CRC
test) for testing the RAS-mutation status in CRC patients
(OncoBEAM RAS CRC IVD IfU).
OncoBEAM platform: analytical and clinical
validity in CRC
The OncoBEAM platform addresses the technical challenge of
identifying rare DNA molecules with enhancements to the PCR
process known as BEAMing. DNA amplification is used to increase
the quantity of DNA species of interest and facilitate measurement.
Conventional PCR carries out one reaction per single sample and
provides one signal. BEAMing involves partitioning of the PCR
process into many individual reactions to provide high resolution
detection of rare DNA sequences (e.g. ones having a RAS muta-
tion). In performing BEAMing, each DNA molecule in a sample is
amplified and converted into a single magnetic particle to which
thousands of copies of DNA identical in sequence to the original
DNA molecule are bound. The resulting magnetic particles (beads)
are a one-to-one representation of the starting DNA molecules in a
given sample and are compartmentalized into water-in-oil microe-
mulsions such that each emulsion contains only one DNA mol-
ecule template. A subsequent amplification step is performed
within each emulsion. Flow cytometry is then applied to assess the
variation within the original population of DNA molecules.
BEAMing is designed to assess hundreds of millions of individual
DNA molecules with standard laboratory equipment. BEAMing
can be used for the identification and subsequent quantification of
cell-free tumor DNA molecules, which are differentiated from nor-
mal (wild-type) DNA by somatic mutations [27]. As a result, this
technology is highly sensitive and reliably detects mutated ctDNA
even when the mutation exists as a rare event, at a level as low as
0.01% [28].
The OncoBEAM assays are able to analyze hotspot mutations
and the number of mutations detected varies per tumor type ana-
lyzed. The OncoBEAM RAS CRC Kit detects 34 mutations in
codons 12, 13, 59, 61, 117, and 146 of the KRAS and NRAS onco-
genes. For other relevant oncogenes, CRC guidelines recommend
BRAF mutational analysis to be performed solely for prognostic
stratification
[29].
A
second-generation
version
of
the
OncoBEAM CRC kit will incorporate BRAF in order to ensure
patients with BRAF mutations are segregated from the RAS wild-
type patients.
OncoBEAM RAS testing has been investigated in several head
to head studies and these have demonstrated high concordance
between blood-based testing versus standard tissue-based RAS
testing methods [26, 30–32]. In particular, OncoBEAM was uti-
lized to evaluate the concordance of RAS status between plasma
and tissue in a large cross-section of mCRC patients [26]. In this
evaluation, two geographically separated cohorts of CRC patients
with metastatic disease from Germany and Australia were se-
lected to represent the intended use population for anti-EGFR
therapy, with plasma taken at the time of tissue biopsy or surgical
resection. Tissue RAS status was evaluated according to the local
standard of care and compared with plasma OncoBEAM RAS
testing results. This initial study showed that the concordance

 between plasma RAS status determined by BEAMing versus that
obtained by FFPE testing was 91.8% for stage IV CRC patients. A
larger performance evaluation from six centers in Europe showed
that the overall concordance between OncoBEAM RAS CRC test-
ing and standard of care tissue testing for 238 patients was 93.3%
[33]. The RAS mutation status determined by OncoBEAM from
plasma versus the tissue reference method is summarized in
Table 2. Plasma RAS mutations were found in 112/121 KRAS
mutant cases determined by tissue-based testing (92.6% of posi-
tive percent agreement) and no RAS mutations were found in
110/117 not mutant cases according to tissue testing (94% of
negative percent agreement. Overall, RAS mutations were de-
tected in 51% of tumor-tissue samples and in 50% of plasma
samples [33]. The frequency of RAS mutations in patients inves-
tigated in this study was in agreement with the results of other
groups performing expanded RAS analysis [34]. All this evidence
provides a high level of confidence that the clinical performance
of plasma RAS testing using OncoBEAM RAS is comparable with
FFPE tissue testing and can be useful in a clinical setting to select
advanced CRC patients for anti-EGFR therapy.
The minimal differences in RAS mutation status between
plasma and tissue may be attributed to intra- or inter-tumor mo-
lecular heterogeneity or variability in tissue techniques. While a
false negative result (no mutation detected in a patient with a
RAS mutant tumor) in either tissue or plasma may lead to the in-
appropriate assignment of first-line treatment anti-EGFR therapy
(with the risk of detrimental outcome with anti-EGFR exposure,
the risk of toxicity and/or allergic reaction and the high expenses
associated with these agents), this risk is largely mitigated by the
high frequency of radiographic surveillance in mCRC patients
undergoing therapy. A false positive result (mutation detected
in a patient that does not have a RAS mutation) may lead to a
patient forgoing first-line anti-EGFR therapy and receiving a less
effective chemotherapy. This risk may be mitigated by the longi-
tudinal evaluation of plasma RAS status during therapy in order
to inform subsequent treatment lines [32]. The evaluation of the
outcomes of false positive and negative cases with OncoBEAM
RAS testing is an area of active investigation. As a more compre-
hensive elucidation of ever-changing tumor dynamics and host
biological influences emerges, this information will lead to a bet-
ter understanding of biological factors influencing ctDNA testing
and subsequent implementation into clinical practice.
BEAMing advantages and current
usefulness
The current standard of care for CRC patients involves tissue mu-
tation testing to determine whether a patient will benefit from the
administration of anti-EGFR therapy. Blood-based RAS muta-
tion testing should address the following unmet needs associated
with tissue testing:
• Delayed processing: Plasma testing is favorable in newly
diagnosed patients or when a patient’s mutation status is un-
known and expedited results are required for therapy selection
(reduction of turnaround time to <7 days). Recently, a quality
survey found that half of all European participating laborato-
ries exceeded the required turnaround time of 14 days for
complete RAS tissue-based testing [35]. These delays in
processing tissue may prohibit the timing of molecular testing
results being available at the time of a patient’s visit, thus
delaying the prescription of optimal therapy.
Invasive biopsies: Obtaining a blood sample is minimally invasive
to the patient compared with obtaining a tissue sample and pro-
vides an alternative when tumor tissue is insufficient for molecu-
lar testing. Need of repeated biopsies in case of metastatic disease:
In a patient with recurrent disease, archival tissue may not reflect
current mutational status and it is common practice to not per-
form a tissue biopsy at time of recurrence. A liquid biopsy test

 can provide real-time information about the current mutational
status of the primary tumor and can serve as an alternative to
archival tissue, which suffers from degradation and may reflect
an ‘archival’ mutation profile that may not be not representative
of the current status [36]. Additionally, a systemic assessment of
tumor mutational status is not practical or feasible in a patient
with metastatic disease. Evidence of molecular heterogeneity
among primary and metastatic sites [14, 37] suggest that a
ctDNA assessment of the mutation status of systemic tumor bur-
den can more precisely guide targeted systemic therapy [14].
When compared with other platforms including NGS,
OncoBEAM assays detect mutations at a higher level of sensitivity
with a focus on clinically actionable gene mutations. While NGS
does have the capability to detect additional gene mutations, the
clinical utility of these additional variants is often not well estab-
lished or aligned to an approved therapeutic; an additional limi-
tation is its low sensitivity. OncoBEAM blood-based assays offer
rapidity of results compared with NGS, with OncoBEAM RAS
testing delivering results within 2–3 days, a critical advantage
when treating patients with advanced or progressing disease.
Moreover, a recent review focused on different technologies for
molecular classification of cancers established that BEAMing is
associated with the lowest costs comparing with other digital
PCR or NGS techniques [22]. Since OncoBEAM RAS test ana-
lyzes an expanded panel of 34 RAS mutations in KRAS and
NRAS, it provides RAS testing in accordance with the current
standard of care molecular testing guidelines as defined as the
ESMO and NCCN committees.
BEAMing future applications
Real-time monitoring of treatment
Minimally invasive diagnostic assays performed by BEAMing are
ideally suited for disease monitoring throughout therapy.
Various studies have demonstrated that ctDNA measurements
can be used to reliably monitor tumor dynamics in subjects
undergoing surgery or chemotherapy [38, 39]. In these studies,
ctDNA levels were compared with imaging and biomarkers such
as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in predicting response
to treatment. Results demonstrated that BEAMing was more
sensitive than imaging, CEA, or total DNA to provide an earlier
indication of response to treatment. This is further supporting
evidence to show that not only does ctDNA levels correlate with
changes in tumor burden, they provide a more immediate
and sensitive measure of response than either imaging or CEA
[28, 39]. Vidal et al. [32] examined the utility of OncoBEAM RAS
CRC ctDNA testing to monitor the efficacy of response to treat-
ment taking serial blood draws from 21 patients with baseline
RAS mutations undergoing systemic therapy. Analysis of RAS
ctDNA at the time of a first CT scan (8–12 weeks of treatment) re-
vealed a dramatic decrease in plasma RAS mutant allele fraction
(MAF) in responding patients with a median of 100%. MAF
percentage of change was significantly lower in patients that pro-
gressed at first evaluation of response compared with patients
with clinical benefit (132% increase versus 99% reduction, re-
spectively, P ¼ 0.027). The authors concluded that RAS plasma
mirrored clinical and radiological response to chemotherapy
drugs and was an early predictor of response [32].
Detection of resistance mechanisms
A blood-based approach enables detection of emergence or dis-
appearance of genetic mutations linked to resistance or suscepti-
bility to targeted therapies [24]. Emergence of RAS mutations is a
frequent mechanism of resistance in mCRC patients treated with
anti-EGFR therapy. A recent study utilizing the OncoBEAM RAS
assay provides preliminary evidence to support the role of moni-
toring emerging RAS in CRC patients receiving anti-EGFR ther-
apy [40]. In this study, 62 of 70 (89%) of mCRC patients who
initially responded to anti-EGFR therapy and chemotherapy
were found to develop resistance. At the time of resistance,
acquired mutations in KRAS were detected by BEAMing in the
plasma of 27/62 (44%) patients. In order to evaluate whether
newly detected KRAS mutations were already present in treat-
ment-naı
¨ve primary tumors as undetectable low frequency clones
or were truly acquired mutations, the investigators utilized the
OncoBEAM RAS assay on the original tumor tissue to re-analyze
archival samples from 20 of 27 patients for traces of KRAS clones.
This analysis revealed that seven (35%) patients had low-
frequency KRAS mutations and that overall, these seven patients
had a poorer prognosis than those determined to be truly
KRAS wild type (median progression-free survival: 3.0 versus
8.0 months, P ¼ 0.0004) [40]. In another study [8], researchers

 conducted a post hoc investigation of patients enrolled in the
phase III CRYSTAL study in order to determine the treatment
effects of cetuximab plus FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI alone for pa-
tients whose tumors had mutations in one of the less common
RAS mutations (located in KRAS codons 61, 117 and 146, or
NRAS codons 12, 13, and 61). Mutational status for an additional
26 RAS mutations was determined by the OncoBEAM RAS assay
for these patients. Using a 5% mutant/wild-type cutoff, an
additional 63 patients (14.7%) were classified as RAS mutant
positive; 86 patients (20%) were identified when a less stringent
cutoff � 0.1% mutant/wild-type sequences was used. When con-
sidering efficacy outcomes between treatment groups, there was
no clear benefit for the addition of cetuximab to FOLFIRI treat-
ment in patients with either �5% RAS mutant/wild-type cutoff.
However, patients with a RAS mutant allele fraction <5% were
able to derive benefit from the addition of cetuximab to FOLFIRI
[8]. The clinical application of OncoBEAM RAS CRC assay for
monitoring of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in rou-
tine clinical practice has been recently evaluated by Vidal et al.
[32]. Emergence of RAS mutations was detected in 7/18 patients
(39%) showing disease progression after an initial complete re-
sponse, partial response or stable disease for >16 weeks, and in
three cases, different RAS mutations were concomitantly detected
[32]. Moreover, Toledo et al. [41] performed a prospective valid-
ation of the BEAMing technique to monitor newly diagnosed
KRAS wt mCRC patients who received a standard FOLFIRI-
cetuximab regimen. They showed that the patients who initially
responded to anti-EGFR therapy but later acquired resistance
presented intermediate and gradually increasing levels of circu-
lating mutant alleles, whereas patients with long-term responses
maintained a wt circulating status throughout the anti-EGFR
therapy. As data continues to emerge showing that the identifica-
tion of RAS mutations in the plasma of relapsed patients indicates
resistance to anti-EGFR therapy, regular analyses could inform
clinical decision making and may offer patients the opportunity
to benefit from therapies designed to overcome resistance, which
in every instance is a more cost-effective approach compared
with tissue-based clinical management.
Early detection of relapse and/or residual disease
The potential of BEAMing technology in this regard was demon-
strated in a proof of concept study that provides insight into the
utility of ctDNA for monitoring treatment response and predict-
ing disease recurrence following surgery [23]. In this study,
mCRC patients were followed throughout both surgery and sys-
temic treatment. A total of 18 patients underwent 22 surgeries of
which 17 were complete tumor resections and 5 were incomplete
resections. A BEAMing assay specific to the molecular profile of
each patient was designed in order to perform plasma mutation
assessments. Plasma samples were collected from 18 patients on
the date of surgery, 24-h post-surgery, and then at regular inter-
vals between 13 and 56 days. ctDNA levels decreased dramatically
in all patients after surgery but were detectable in the first follow-
up visit (within 13–56 days) in 16/20 instances (plasma samples
were only available in 20 instances—not 22). In all but one of
these instances the patients’ diseases recurred. In contrast, in 4
patients in whom mutant DNA was undetectable, no recurrence
occurred [23]. The pilot study of Misale et al. [39] showed that
emergence of KRAS mutations was detectable in plasma as early
as 10 months before the documentation of disease progression by
radiological assessment. In line with these results, ctDNA-based
detection preceded clinical detection of metastasis in 86% of
breast cancer patients with an average lead time of 11 months
(range 0–37 months), whereas patients with long-term disease-
free survival had undetectable ctDNA postoperatively [42].
A pressing question is how often to perform a liquid biopsy
[8], while this is not yet established, the most practical frequency
appears to be every 4–6 weeks interspersed and/or in conjunction
with radiological scans. Serial ctDNA measurements could
complement routine imaging-based assessments in evaluation of
disease bulk [43], response to chemotherapeutic agents, re-
challenge with anti-EGFR therapy [44], and detection of residual
disease after surgical resection of the tumor [45]. In the last case,
this approach could aid to select treatment strategies in patients
with residual disease that could benefit from adjuvant chemo-
therapy and intensive surveillance.
Early detection of cancer
It is worthwhile to highlight the potential application of
OncoBEAM RAS testing as a screening tool for pre-neoplastic
lesions or localized neoplastic disease. Bettegowda et al. [20]
showed that ctDNA is more readily detected in the blood of
patients with more invasive tumors rather than earlier tumors,
but even so the sensitivity for detection was 50% in early-stage
disease. However, only RAS mutant patients would benefit from
the use of this test as screening method.
Concluding remarks
The clinical utility of a diagnostic test pertains to the ability of the
test to provide new information that leads to a clinical benefit. The
importance of RAS testing in mCRC patient selection for anti-
EGFR therapy is well established, but due to known limitations of
tissue-based testing and delays in clinical turnaround time, a sig-
nificant proportion of patients are being treated or receiving
delayed treatment without the information that RAS testing can
provide. The clinical utility of the OncoBEAM RAS test allows pa-
tients to benefit from international guideline-recommended ex-
panded RAS testing with rapid turnaround times.
OncoBEAM RAS testing has also potential utility in monitor-
ing patients who have relapsed on treatment with anti-EGFR
therapy. Identification by blood-based OncoBEAM testing of any
RAS mutation in relapsed patients may be indicative of emergent
resistance to anti-EGFR therapy, providing insight into the tim-
ing of subsequent lines of therapy. The high degree of concord-
ance of RAS testing results generated by blood-based OncoBEAM
RAS testing versus standard tissue testing methods supports
the conclusion that detection of RAS mutations in the blood
with BEAMing may be a useful replacement to tumor testing.
OncoBEAM RAS testing also makes possible to examine a minim-
ally invasive method for detecting early resistance to anti-EGFR
therapy. All these features represent a clear benefit to patient care.
Incorporation of the OncoBEAM RAS into clinical practice is
therefore likely to add precision and provide cost-effective man-
agement by individualizing treatment plans for the CRC patient.
