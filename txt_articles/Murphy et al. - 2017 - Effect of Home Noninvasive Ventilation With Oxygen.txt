IMPORTANCE Outcomes after exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) requiring acute noninvasive ventilation (NIV) are poor and there are few treatments
to prevent hospital readmission and death.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of home NIV plus oxygen on time to readmission or
death in patients with persistent hypercapnia after an acute COPD exacerbation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized clinical trial of patients with persistent
hypercapnia (PaCO2 >53 mm Hg) 2 weeks to 4 weeks after resolution of respiratory acidemia,
who were recruited from 13 UK centers between 2010 and 2015. Exclusion criteria included
obesity (body mass index [BMI] >35), obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, or other causes of
respiratory failure. Of 2021 patients screened, 124 were eligible.
INTERVENTIONS There were 59 patients randomized to home oxygen alone (median oxygen
flow rate, 1.0 L/min [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.5-2.0 L/min]) and 57 patients to home
oxygen plus home NIV (median oxygen flow rate, 1.0 L/min [IQR, 0.5-1.5 L/min]). The median
home ventilator settings were an inspiratory positive airway pressure of 24 (IQR, 22-26) cm
H2O, an expiratory positive airway pressure of 4 (IQR, 4-5) cm H2O, and a backup rate of 14
(IQR, 14-16) breaths/minute.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Time to readmission or death within 12 months adjusted for
the number of previous COPD admissions, previous use of long-term oxygen, age, and BMI.
RESULTS A total of 116 patients (mean [SD] age of 67 [10] years, 53% female, mean BMI of
21.6 [IQR, 18.2-26.1], mean [SD] forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration of
0.6 L [0.2 L], and mean [SD] PaCO2 while breathing room air of 59 [7] mm Hg) were
randomized. Sixty-four patients (28 in home oxygen alone and 36 in home oxygen plus home
NIV) completed the 12-month study period. The median time to readmission or death was
4.3 months (IQR, 1.3-13.8 months) in the home oxygen plus home NIV group vs 1.4 months
(IQR, 0.5-3.9 months) in the home oxygen alone group, adjusted hazard ratio of 0.49 (95%
CI, 0.31-0.77; P = .002). The 12-month risk of readmission or death was 63.4% in the home
oxygen plus home NIV group vs 80.4% in the home oxygen alone group, absolute risk
reduction of 17.0% (95% CI, 0.1%-34.0%). At 12 months, 16 patients had died in the home
oxygen plus home NIV group vs 19 in the home oxygen alone group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with persistent hypercapnia following an
acute exacerbation of COPD, adding home noninvasive ventilation to home oxygen therapy
prolonged the time to readmission or death within 12 months.

hronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is char-
acterized by recurrent exacerbations that can cause in-
termittentperiodsofsevereclinicaldeteriorationrequir-
ing hospitalization and ventilator support. Although treating
patients with COPD and acute respiratory failure with nonin-
vasive ventilation improves outcomes,1,2 persistent hypercap-
nia after an exacerbation is associated with excess mortality3,4
and early rehospitalization.5 In 2013, the 28-day COPD read-
mission rate was around 20%,6 and there were financial pen-
altiesinplaceintheUnitedKingdomandUnitedStatesforsuch
early readmissions. These data have contributed to readmis-
sion prevention being a priority area for clinicians.
One treatment option would be to use noninvasive venti-
lation in addition to oxygen therapy in the home setting. Small,
uncontrolled studies demonstrating the physiological effi-
cacy of home noninvasive ventilation in patients with COPD7-9
have led to its prescription across Europe.10 However, subse-
quent clinical studies failed to demonstrate either physiologi-
cal (reduced hypercapnia) or clinical (mortality) efficacy,11,12
and questions remain regarding whether the application of the
intervention was optimized in these randomized clinical trials.
Thelackofimprovementinchronicrespiratoryfailuremay
explain the failure of earlier trials,13 which is a theory sup-
ported by data from Köhnlein et al14 that demonstrated both
improvement of chronic respiratory failure and a mortality re-
duction. However, the participants in this trial were atypical
of most patients with severe COPD and had relatively pre-
served exercise capacity and a low exacerbation and hospital
admission rate, which limits the clinical applicability of these
findings. In contrast, the Respiratory Support in COPD after
Acute Exacerbation (RESCUE) trial,15 which targeted patients
with frequent exacerbations, failed to demonstrate a clinical
benefit of home noninvasive ventilation when added to stan-
dard care.
In this multicenter randomized clinical trial conducted in
the United Kingdom, it was hypothesized that the addition of
home noninvasive ventilation to home oxygen therapy would
prolong the time to readmission or death among patients with
persistent hypercapnia following an acute life-threatening ex-
acerbation of COPD requiring acute noninvasive ventilation.
Methods
Trial Design and Patients
The trial was a phase 3, multicenter, open-label, parallel-group
randomized clinical trial with a 1:1 allocation to home oxygen
therapy alone or home noninvasive ventilation plus home oxy-
gen therapy. The trial was approved by St Thomas’Hospital re-
search ethics committee (09/H0802/2) and by local research
and development committees at participating centers. All re-
cruitedpatientsprovidedwritteninformedconsentandalltrial
procedures conformed to local policies. The trial protocol and
statistical analysis plan appear in Supplement 1.
Patients were recruited from 13 UK centers and were fol-
lowed up for 12 months. Patients admitted with acute decom-
pensated hypercapnic exacerbations of COPD requiring acute
noninvasive ventilation were screened for eligibility at least 2
weeks after resolution of decompensated acidosis (arterial pH
>7.30) and within 4 weeks of attaining clinical stability
(eMethods in Supplement 2). Patients were required to have
persistent hypercapnia (PaCO2 >53 mm Hg) and hypoxemia
(PaO2 <55 mm Hg or <60 mm Hg; ≥1 of polycythemia, pulmo-
nary hypertension, or cor pulmonale; >30% of sleep time with
oxygen saturation <90% as measured by pulse oximetry); and
arterial pH greater than 7.30 while breathing room air.
Arterial blood gas analysis was performed after at least 1
night without noninvasive ventilation support and after re-
ceiving oxygen therapy overnight. Chronic respiratory fail-
ure was attributed to severe COPD provided that the forced ex-
piratoryvolumeinthefirstsecondofexpiration(FEV1)wasless
than 50% of predicted, the ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capac-
ity was less than 60%, and the patient had a smoking history
of greater than 20 pack-years and was in the absence of (1) obe-
sity (body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms di-
vided by height in meters squared] >35), (2) clinically signifi-
cant obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (if clinically suspected
by attending physician from history, examination, or base-
line oximetry, it was then investigated with attended limited
respiratory polygraphy; eMethods in Supplement 2), and
(3) neuromuscular or chest wall disease.
Patients were excluded if they (1) were not assessed
within 4 weeks of resolution of the index COPD exacerbation,
(2) required intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation
during the index exacerbation, (3) were currently using non-
invasive home mechanical ventilation, (4) exhibited cogni-
tive impairment or unstable psychiatric morbidity, (5) were
undergoing renal replacement therapy, (6) had active
unstable coronary artery syndrome, (7) were younger than 18
years, and (8) were homeless. Additional exclusion criteria
appear in Figure 1.
Eligible patients were transferred for assessment to a spe-
cialist noninvasive ventilation center if they met the above cri-
teria during the index admission and within the time frame af-
ter discharge or transfer.
Randomization and Masking
Patients were randomized by the Oxford Clinical Trials Unit
using computer-based minimization software (Minim). Mini-
mization summates the imbalance within each stratification
variable if a patient is allocated to a particular treatment group,
Key Points
Question Does the addition of home noninvasive ventilation
to home oxygen therapy prolong time to readmission or death
for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
persistent hypercapnia following a life-threatening exacerbation?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 116 patients, the
addition of home noninvasive ventilation significantly prolonged
time to readmission or death from 1.4 months to 4.3 months.
Meaning The addition of home noninvasive ventilation to home
oxygen therapy may improve outcomes in patients with severe
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and persistent hypercapnia
following hospital admission.

 and the next treatment to be randomized is chosen depend-
ing on which treatment would minimize the imbalance.16
Theminimizationcriteriawereage(<65yearsvs≥65years),
body mass index (≤20 vs >20), current long-term oxygen
therapy use (yes vs no), frequency of COPD-related readmis-
sions during previous 12 months (<3 vs ≥3), and recruitment
center. Although there was no suitable sham option for non-
invasive ventilation, and the supervising clinicians were un-
blinded to treatment allocation, the trial staff conducting the
outcome assessments were blinded to treatment allocation.
Intervention
Noninvasive ventilation was initiated using nasal, oronasal, or
total face masks per patient preference. Noninvasive ventila-
tion was delivered using the Harmony 2 ventilator (Philips Res-
pironics) or the VPAP IIISTa ventilator (ResMed) with each cen-
ter restricted to a single model. Patients underwent daytime
noninvasive ventilation acclimatization, followed by noctur-
nal titration with oxygen entrained at the daytime prescrip-
tion rate (eMethods and eAppendix 1 in Supplement 2). The
aim was to achieve control of nocturnal hypoventilation with
a high-pressure ventilation strategy.17
In both patient groups, oxygen therapy was initiated at the
lowest flow rate required to increase the PaO2 level to greater
than 60 mm Hg without producing decompensated respira-
tory failure, which was defined as an arterial pH of less than
7.30 on the morning blood gas measurement after overnight
use of oxygen without noninvasive ventilation. All patients
wereinstructedtouseoxygentherapyforatleast15hoursdaily.
Thepatientsallocatedtohomeoxygentherapyplushomenon-
invasive ventilation were instructed to use the ventilator for
a minimum of 6 hours nightly.
All patients had medical management optimized for COPD
according to guidelines from the British Thoracic Society18 that
included regular, triple-inhaled bronchodilator therapy (long-
acting β-agonist, long-acting antimuscarinic, and steroid), as-
needed inhaled short-acting β-agonist therapy, sputum clear-
ance techniques where appropriate, smoking cessation
support, and education on COPD self-management. Patients
allocated to home oxygen therapy alone could receive acute
noninvasive ventilation during hospital readmissions for de-
compensated respiratory failure with the intention of being
weaned and discharged back to oxygen alone unless there was
a breach in the safety criteria (eMethods in Supplement 2).

censored at the time of hospital readmission. Patients who
withdrew were censored at the time of study withdrawal and
were considered as not meeting the primary end point. Any
patients who were readmitted to the hospital prior to with-
drawal were censored at the time of the hospital readmis-
sion. Baseline descriptive data were recorded in line with lo-
cal and national guidelines and included collection of
anthropometric data, sex (self-reported), and spirometry and
arterial blood gas analysis.
Secondary exploratory outcomes included all-cause mor-
tality, exacerbation frequency (exacerbation defined in
eMethods, eAppendix 1, and eAppendix 2 in Supplement 2),
change in arterial PaCO2 and PaO2 while breathing room air,
change in control of sleep-disordered breathing (as measured

using the Medical Research Council dyspnea score19 (categori-
cal scale from 1-5; higher scores indicate more limitations on
daily activities due to breathlessness), health-related quality of

tionnaire (0 = worst quality of life, 100 = best quality of life),20
and the St George’
s Respiratory Questionnaire (0 = best qual-
ityoflife,100 = worstqualityoflife;minimallyimportantclini-
cal difference of 4)21,22 at each follow-up assessment.
Hospital readmission and exacerbation data were col-
lected at each follow-up visit (6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months,
and 12 months) and vital status at trial completion was estab-
lished using the National Health Service information center for
patients lost to follow-up. We performed sensitivity analyses
on the primary outcome to assess for robustness post hoc.
Sample Size Calculation and Statistical Analysis
The sample size was based on UK audit data (M. W. Elliott, MD,
Department of Respiratory Medicine, Leeds University Hos-
pital,oralcommunication,2008),assumingareadmissionrate
of 55% at 12 months in patients after an admission requiring
treatment with noninvasive ventilation for an acute exacer-
bation of COPD. If home noninvasive ventilation reduced re-
admissions to 25% at 12 months, and assuming a loss to
follow-up of 22%, 116 patients would be needed to provide
80% power with a 2-sided significance level of .05.
Data are presented as mean (standard deviation) or me-
dian (interquartile range [IQR]) as appropriate. All primary and
secondaryanalyseswereassessedforsuperiorityandwereana-
lyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle, including
all randomized patients in whom an outcome was available.
The primary outcome defined as time from randomization to
hospital readmission or death was analyzed using a Cox pro-
portional hazards regression model adjusted for minimiza-
tion variables (age, body mass index, current long-term oxy-
gen therapy use, frequency of COPD readmissions over 12
months). To avoid overstratification, recruiting center was not
included in the adjusted model.23
Sensitivity analyses using best-case and worst-case sce-
narios were performed post hoc to assess the robustness of the
primaryoutcomeanalysis.Thebest-casescenarioassumedpa-
tients who withdrew were neither readmitted to the hospital
nor died and were censored 12 months after randomization.
The worst-case scenario assumed patients who withdrew were
readmitted to the hospital or died and were censored at the
point of withdrawal. These analyses explore the most ex-
treme scenarios for patients who withdrew prior to reaching
the primary end point.
Other post hoc analyses included time to hospital read-
mission 28 days after randomization and were analyzed using
a Cox proportional hazards regression model for comparison
with previous studies. The per-protocol analysis excluded pa-
tients (1) who switched treatment during the trial prior to
achieving the primary end point and (2) whose average daily
use of noninvasive ventilation was less than 4 hours. Addi-
tional analyses included center as a fixed effect and as a ran-
dom effect, with the latter being a post hoc analysis. Unad-
justed hazard ratios (HRs) for treatment effects are also
presented. Full details appear in the statistical analysis plan
in Supplement 1.
All-cause mortality was analyzed using a Cox propor-
tional hazards regression model. A post hoc analysis of the
number of exacerbations per year was performed using (1)
negative binomial regression due to clustering of exacerba-
tions within patients and (2) linear mixed-effects regression
models with a random effect for center to assess continuous
variables. Statistical significance was concluded at the 2-sided
significance level of .05 for all analyses. All analyses were con-
ducted using Stata software version 14.1 (StataCorp).
Results
Patients
Of the 2021 patients screened, 124 were eligible, and 116 pa-
tients were randomized between February 27, 2010, and
April 6, 2015 (Figure 1). There were 57 patients randomized to
home oxygen therapy plus home noninvasive ventilation and
59 patients to home oxygen therapy alone. The final patient
visit occurred on April 23, 2016. Sixty-four patients (28 in the
home oxygen therapy alone group and 36 in the home oxy-
gen therapy plus home noninvasive ventilation group) com-
pleted the 12-month study period.
Eighteen patients withdrew from the study, 12 before
reaching the primary outcome (10 patients in the home oxy-
gentherapyalonegroupand2inthehomeoxygentherapyplus
home noninvasive ventilation group). Seventeen patients ini-
tially randomized to receive home oxygen therapy alone had
home noninvasive ventilation added after reaching the pri-
mary outcome of readmission, which was consistent with the
trial protocol (eMethods in Supplement 2).
At the discretion of the treating clinician (on trial day 2)
and prior to reaching the primary outcome, 1 patient random-
ized to the home oxygen therapy alone group was instructed
to add home noninvasive ventilation but remained in the
home oxygen therapy group for analysis purposes. Baseline

 characteristics appear in Table 1. The groups were well bal-
anced for important baseline variables, including minimiza-
tion factors. The randomized cohort had severe COPD as
evidenced by severe airflow obstruction (mean [SD] FEV1
of 0.6 L [0.2 L] and mean [SD] ratio of FEV1 to forced vital
capacity of 0.4 [0.1]) and hypercapnia respiratory failure
(mean [SD] PaCO2 of 59 [7] mm Hg). There was no evidence of
significant obstructive sleep apnea in randomized patients
(eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
The dropout rate was within the prespecified power cal-
culation and the retention and follow-up numbers appear in
eTable 2 in Supplement 2. The median follow-up time was 12.2
months (IQR, 8.9-12.9 months) for the home oxygen therapy
plus home noninvasive ventilation group and 8.1 months (IQR,
2.3-12.6 months) for the home oxygen therapy alone group.
Intervention
There was no significant between-group difference in the
oxygen therapy flow rates after baseline titration (median
oxygen flow rate, 1.0 L/min [IQR, 0.5-2.0 L/min] for the home
oxygen therapy alone group vs 1.0 L/min [IQR, 0.5-1.5 L/min]
for the home oxygen therapy plus home noninvasive ventila-
tion group; P = .11).
The median ventilator settings at hospital discharge in the
homeoxygentherapyplushomenoninvasiveventilationgroup
wereaninspiratorypositiveairwaypressureof24cmH2O(IQR,
22-26 cm H2O), an expiratory positive airway pressure of 4 cm
H2O (IQR, 4-5 cm H2O), and a backup rate of 14 breaths/
minute (IQR, 14-16 breaths/minute). Ventilator use at 6 weeks
was 4.7 hours per night (IQR, 2.5-5.6 hours per night), which
increased during the trial to 7.6 hours per night (IQR, 3.6-8.4
hours per night) at 12 months (eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
Delivery and Efficacy of Home Noninvasive Ventilation
There was a statistically significant reduction in nocturnal
transcutaneous carbon dioxide levels on the night after ini-
tiation of noninvasive ventilation, which persisted to 12
months; however, at 6 months the between-group difference
was not statistically significant (adjusted mean difference,
−0.63 kPa [95% CI, −1.55 to 0.30 kPa], P = .18; eTable 4 in
Supplement 2).
There was a statistically significant between-group differ-
ence in daytime PaCO2 at 6 weeks and 3 months favoring the
home oxygen therapy plus home noninvasive ventilation
group, but not at 12 months. There was no corresponding im-
provement in oxygenation (Table 2).

 Primary Outcome: Time to Readmission or Death
The median time to readmission or death was 4.3 months
(IQR, 1.3-13.8 months) in the home oxygen therapy plus home

pared with 80.4% in the home oxygen therapy alone group,
resulting in an absolute risk reduction of 17.0% (95% CI, 0.1%-

The per-protocol and sensitivity analyses also were
consistent with these results (eResults and eTable 5 in

(95% CI, 0.11-0.61; P = .002) (eFigure in Supplement 2). The
majority of readmissions during follow-up were related to re-
spiratory concerns (201/209 readmissions).

tween-group difference of −4.30 (95% CI, −8.39 to −0.21;
P = .04) and a significant adjusted between-group difference
of −4.85 (95% CI, −8.83 to −0.88; P = .02), indicating a ben-
eficial effect of home noninvasive ventilation on health-
related quality of life at this time point. There were no signifi-
cant differences demonstrated thereafter (Table 3).
Discussion
In this randomized clinical trial, an improvement in time to re-
admissionordeathwasobservedwhenhomenoninvasiveven-
tilation was added to home oxygen therapy in patients with
persistent hypercapnia following a life-threatening acute ex-
acerbation of COPD. These data support the screening of pa-
tients with COPD after receiving acute noninvasive ventila-
tion to identify persistent hypercapnia and introduce home
noninvasive ventilation.
The current data differ from the RESCUE trial,15 even
though the trial designs were similar. The RESCUE trial
showed no difference in time to readmission or death within
12 months. Differences in the study population and protocol
may explain the discordant results because the RESCUE
trial15 enrolled patients with a less stringent PaCO2 criterion
(daytime PaCO2 >45 mm Hg) following cessation of acute
noninvasive ventilation, whereas the current trial only
recruited patients if the daytime PaCO2 was greater than
53 mm Hg at least 2 weeks after resolution of acute respira-
tory acidemia. Furthermore, and unlike the RESCUE trial,15
the current study also required demonstration of chronic
hypoxemia and thus targeted patients with more severe
COPD. Such patients with chronic respiratory failure have
previously been shown to benefit from noninvasive ventila-
tion in physiological studies.7,9
The early, within-hospital assessment of hypercapnia
in the RESCUE trial may have led to the inclusion of patients
with spontaneously reversible hypercapnia and conse-
quently a better prognosis.24 Consistent with this conjecture,
the control group as well as the treatment noninvasive venti-
lation group of the RESCUE study showed a reduction in
daytime PaCO2 within 6 weeks of enrollment,15 supporting
the rationale that the trajectory of recovery for hypercapnia
determines the likelihood of response to home noninvasive
ventilation. However, the improvement in hypercapnia dem-
onstrated could be accounted for by regression to the mean
rather than a true physiological effect. Based on previous data
from the investigators,17 the current trial protocol adopted a
high-pressure titration strategy with a demonstrated effect on
nocturnal hypoventilation.
Despite the delay in time to readmission or death with
enhanced control of nocturnal ventilation and reduced exac-
erbation frequency, there was only an initial modest effect
on health-related quality of life with the addition of home
noninvasiveventilation.Thisisperhapsunsurprisinggiventhe
severity of disease in the COPD cohort enrolled and the high
levels of physical impairment at baseline. The results of the
current trial are reassuring, suggesting that home noninva-
sive ventilation added to home oxygen therapy in this popu-
lation improved the overall clinical outcome without adding
to the health burden of the patient, countering earlier con-
cerns raised by the Australian trial of Non-invasive Ventila-
tion in Chronic Airflow Limitation.12
The participant flow diagram (Figure 1) shows that 2021
patients were screened and considered eligible for the trial. Al-
though only 6% of screened patients were recruited into the
trial, one-third of the screened patients were ineligible be-
cause they could either not wean from acute noninvasive ven-
tilation due to clinical instability, they died prior to screen-
ing, or they were unable to provide consent. These factors
highlight that this was a cohort of patients with severe dis-
ease, contributing to the recruitment rate observed. The pro-
cess of assessing the patients during the recovery phase, and
only recruiting those patients with a PaCO2 of greater than
53 mm Hg, helped to ensure the cohort was enriched with pa-
tientswithchronicrespiratoryfailure,whichisthecohortmost

 likely to benefit from the addition of home noninvasive ven-
tilation therapy.
Patients with established chronic respiratory failure sec-
ondarytoCOPDhavepooroutcomeswithlimitedtreatmentop-
tions available.3,4 The driver of the clinical improvement in the
homeoxygentherapyplushomenoninvasiveventilationgroup
was readmission avoidance with no significant difference in
mortality observed between the treatment group and the stan-
dard care home oxygen therapy alone group for both the event
triggeringtheprimaryoutcomeandat12months.However,the
study was not powered to detect a difference for this outcome.
This study has major clinical relevance because readmission
avoidance is beneficial to the patient in terms of preservation
of lung function and health-related quality of life25 as well as
providing a direct and indirect cost saving.
The results of this study support the use of in-home,
high-pressure noninvasive ventilation in patients who have
persistent hypercapnia for 2 to 4 weeks after resolution of
respiratory acidemia requiring acute noninvasive ventilation.
There are physiological mechanisms that underpin the effect
of home noninvasive ventilation when added to home oxy-
gen therapy that could explain the clinical benefit of reduced
hospital readmission. Previous physiological studies have
shown that home noninvasive ventilation in patients with
severe COPD improves ventilatory response to hypercapnia,7
which could be expected to act as a clinically relevant effect
of treatment, allowing a more robust and adaptive response
to the adverse physiological challenge of an acute PaCO2
increase during an exacerbation.
Furthermore,imagingdatasuggestthathigh-pressurenon-
invasive ventilation may contribute to airway remodeling and
improvedventilation-perfusionmatching.26Inaddition,theob-
servation of an improvement in gas exchange with a reduction
in PaCO2 and exacerbation frequency is supported by data that
have shown that hypercapnia decreases secretion of IL-6 and
tumor necrosis factor in the lungs and impairs lung neutrophil
function in an animal model of lung infection.27 Future experi-
ments are required to investigate this observation.
Limitations
This study has a number of limitations. First, the lack of a
double-blind design for this trial is a potential criticism.
The use of a sham device group was considered because this
approach has been used previously in continuous positive air-
way pressure trials in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.28
However, the use of a device modified to deliver zero pres-
sure support through a nasal or face mask could result in
an increase in dynamic dead space,29 which would have the
potential to worsen respiratory failure. In addition, sham
continuous positive airway pressure can affect sleep architec-
ture, the clinical significance of which is unknown.30 There
was further concern regarding the effectiveness of blinding in
sham device trials because both patients and clinicians have
been able to identify the sham intervention, limiting the sci-
entific justification of this approach.31,32 The unblinded trial
design and lack of a sham device, with blinded assessment in
terms of the outcome, is consistent with other clinical trials
in this field.11,12,14,15

 Second, the trial design was pragmatic in that it made pro-
vision for patients initially allocated to home oxygen therapy
to have home noninvasive ventilation added if they breached
safety criteria after reaching the primary outcome. Eighteen
patients initially allocated to home oxygen therapy alone had
home noninvasive ventilation added to their management
strategy. In 17 of 18 cases (94%), the addition of home nonin-
vasive ventilation occurred after the primary end point was
reached, thus not affecting the primary analysis. This proto-
col design may have contributed to the apparent dilution of
treatment effect of home noninvasive ventilation on daytime
hypercapnia, nocturnal hypoventilation, and quality of life af-
ter 3 months because home noninvasive ventilation had been
added by this time point to the treatment of more than half the
remaining patients in the home oxygen therapy alone group.
Third, the statistical analysis plan for the study included
a number of secondary outcomes that should be considered
exploratorybecausenocorrectionswereusedformultiplecom-
parisons. The secondary outcomes were included to provide
mechanistic support for the primary outcome. The use of a
single level of significance for secondary outcomes is consis-
tent with other data in this area.14,15
Conclusions
Amongpatientswithpersistenthypercapniafollowinganacute
exacerbation of COPD, adding home noninvasive ventilation
to home oxygen therapy prolonged the time to readmission or
death within 12 months.

uncompensated contributions to trial design and
management made by Robert Davies, MD, who
died before completion of the trial. We also
acknowledge the efforts of all the research teams
at the recruiting centers and in particular Michael
Davies, MD (Respiratory Support and Sleep Center,
Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, England), and
Robert Angus, MD (Respiratory Medicine,
Aintree University Hospital, Liverpool, England),
who assisted with trial delivery and recruitment
without remuneration.
