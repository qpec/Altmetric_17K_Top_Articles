Introduction: We conducted an overview of systematic reviews of interventions for the prevention of low back
19
pain (LBP) that can be conducted in a workplace setting. Methods: An electronic literature search was performed
20
in Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Published peer-reviewed systematic reviews and meta-analyses,
21
which described interventions for the primary or secondary prevention of LBP applicable to a workplace setting,
22
were eligible for inclusion. The methodological quality of the included systematic reviews was assessed with
23
the AMSTAR tool. The primary outcome of interest was the incidence of LBP; secondary outcomes were
24
LBP-associated absenteeism, activity interference, and costs related to LBP. Results: Twenty-eight eligible articles
25
published between 1994 and 2016 were included in a qualitative synthesis following our screening of abstracts
26
and full-text articles. The AMSTAR rating revealed 14 reviews of high, 10 of moderate, and 4 of low methodolog-
27
ical quality. The identified interventions included workplace modifications (6 reviews, 10 studies, 6,751 subjects);
28
shoe insoles (4 reviews, 6 studies, 2,356 subjects); and lumbar supports and other assistive devices (15 reviews,
29
18 studies, 60,678 subjects). Educational interventions investigated were back schools (10 reviews, 30 studies,
30
9,973 subjects); manual material handling techniques/advice (6 reviews, 24 studies, 10,505 subjects);
31
and other forms of instruction including pamphlets, booklets, and other media (four reviews, 14 studies,
32
11,991 subjects). Exercise interventions, investigated in 12 reviews (35 studies, 19,330 subjects), showed
33
moderate quality evidence of effectiveness for exercise interventions alone or in conjunction with educational
34
interventions; no other type of intervention was consistently effective in the prevention of LBP or LBP-
35
associated outcomes of interest. Conclusions: Our overview provides evidence of effectiveness for exercise with
36
or without educational interventions in the prevention of LBP. Practical applications: Exercise interventions
37
with or without educational interventions that can be applied in the workplace have the potential to prevent LBP.

1. Introduction
50
Non-specific low back pain (LBP) is a major public health concern,
51
with a significant impact on productivity, work ability, and quality of
52
life (Fan, 2016). The lifetime prevalence of non-specific LBP is 60–70%
53
in industrialized countries with an annual adult incidence of 5%
54
(Duthey, 2013). Work-related LBP was estimated to account for 37%
55
of LBP globally, with a two-fold variation across different geographical
56
regions (Punnett, 2005).
57
Non-specific LBP is the most important cause for the limitation
58
of individual activities with subsequent work absenteeism globally,
59
imposing a significant financial burden on healthcare systems and econ-
60
omies (Duthey, 2013). It has also been reported that 35% of all disability
61
adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide were linked to different occupa-
62
tional factors, and about 21.8 million DALYs globally were attributed to
63
work-related LBP in 2010 (Driscoll, Jacklyn, Orchard, et al., 2014).
64
Low back pain is associated with a considerable socioeconomic
65
burden. For instance, LBP was reported to be the most common cause
66
of disability in young adults in the United Kingdom in a study carried
67
out in 1996, causing more than 100 million workdays lost annually
68
(Croft, Rigby, Boswell, Schollum, & Silman, 1993; Duthey, 2013). A
69
survey in 1996 showed that the population of the United Kingdom
70
was estimated at 58.2 million (Jefferies, 2005). At an estimated population
71
size of 244.5 million (Population Estimates Program, Population Division,
72
U.S. Census Bureau, n.d.), a 1988 study conducted in the United States
73
demonstrated that LBP was responsible for about 149 million workdays
74
lost per year (Guo, Tanaka, Halperin, & Cameron, 1999), with overall
75
annual costs ranging from 100 to 200 billion US dollars (Katz, 2006;
76
Rubin, 2007).

77
Several factors including anthropometric characteristics, the na-
78
ture and severity of physical work, working postures, and methods
79
of manual lifting/handling have been linked to the development of
80
LBP. In addition, other aspects such as lifestyle conditions and psy-
81
chological factors (Duthey, 2013) may also be considered as indepen-
82
dent risk factors for the development of LBP. Due to the multifaceted
83
etiological nature of LBP, it can be a challenge to diagnose and treat
84
(Duthey, 2013). Understanding the mechanism of LBP development
85
may enable advancement of interventions to either prevent or treat
86
this condition.
87
As non-specific LBP has a high global prevalence resulting in consid-
88
erable health and socioeconomic consequences, together with the fact
89
that currently available treatment options are not always satisfactory,
90
preventive efforts therefore merit special attention (Luhmann, 2006).
91
Interventions aimed at the prevention of LBP are desirable for the work-
92
place setting - in principle, as prevention of pain is generally preferable
93
to its treatment - and also because of the specific difficulty in treating al-
94
ready established LBP and the adverse effects of some analgesics that
95
may impact alertness or cognition, and therefore safety at work. Many
96
interventions such as education (e.g., back schools), exercise, lumbar
97
supports (e.g., back belts), lifting techniques, insoles/foot orthoses,
98
chair backrests and dynamic sitting, training of employees, and organi-
99
zational interventions (Luhmann, 2006) have been suggested to pre-
100
vent work-related LBP. Moreover, a number of systematic reviews
101
have been carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of these interven-
102
tions, either individually or in combination. Nevertheless, these system-
103
atic reviews may come to no definitive conclusion and sometimes offer
104
contradictory conclusions on the same or similar interventions.
105
Therefore, we have conducted an overview of systematic reviews
106
evaluating the effectiveness of various interventions carried out in the
107
workplace or which could be carried out in such a setting to prevent
108
work-related LBP. Based on the PRISMA statement (Liberati, Altman,
109
Tetzlaff, et al., 2009) and the Cochrane Collaboration (Green et al.,
110
2011) definitions, a systematic review seeks to address a clearly pre-
111
formulated question that employs systematic and explicit methods
112
to collate relevant research, and to collect and analyze data from the
113
studies that satisfy a pre-defined set of eligibility criteria. A systematic
114
review may or may not include meta-analysis, which refers to the use
115
of statistical techniques to combine the results of included studies. The
116
summaries and conclusions of systematic reviews are intended to
117
inform, for example, on the effectiveness or lack thereof of an interven-
118
tion. An overview of systematic reviews, as employed in the present
119
study, seeks to compile and summarize data from various systematic
120
reviews regarding an intervention. For the purposes of this study,
121
the term workplace interventions may include changes made at the
122
workplace to modify body function (physical or mental), activity,
123
participation, environmental factors (physical, social or attitudinal),
124
personal factors, or a combination of these. This is in keeping with
125
previous work that defined intervention approaches based on the
126
International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF,
127
under the WHO, 2001) (Aas, Tuntland, Holte, et al., 2011).
128
The present overview of systematic reviews, thus, aims to assess
129
the evidence for the various workplace interventions employed to
130
prevent the development of back pain, as reviewed in the published
131
medical literature and aims to provide recommendations for occupa-
132
tional health practice.
133
2. Methods
134
2.1. Searching
135
An electronic literature search was conducted in Medline (Ovid),
136
EMBASE (Ovid), and the Cochrane Library. The last search date
137
was April 20th 2017. The search strategies and study selection are
138
outlined in the Appendix. We considered reviews published in English
139
or German.
140
2.2. Inclusion criteria
141
To be included in the analysis, articles had to be published peer-
142
reviewed systematic reviews or meta-analyses (i.e., numerical evidence
143
syntheses). Additionally, the reviews had to describe interventions,
144
which pertained to primary or secondary prevention of LBP and were
145
performed in, or applicable to, an occupational setting (i.e., the work-
146
place). Articles in the gray literature were excluded. Also considered
147
ineligible were pharmacological interventions to treat LBP. Guidelines
148
on low back pain prevention per se were excluded, however guidelines
149
based on systematic reviews were screened further to assess if the sys-
150
tematic reviews satisfied our inclusion criteria. Two reviewers (DS, RB) in-
151
dependently selected articles in accordance with the above-mentioned
152
criteria that had been determined a priori. Discrepancies were resolved
153
with the help of another reviewer (SS).
154
2.3. Quality assessment of the systematic reviews and data extraction
155
The methodological quality of included reviews was evaluated using
156
the Assessment of Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews
157
(AMSTAR) guideline (Shea, Hamel, Wells, et al., 2009), which consisted
158
of 11 criteria, each given a rating of ‘yes’ (1), ‘no’ (0), ‘can't answer’
159
(0) or ‘not applicable’ (0). A review was considered high quality when
160
the total score was 8–11; a total score of 4–7 was considered moderate
161
quality, while a score of 0–3 was low quality. Data on the authors, date
162
of publication, number of studies and subjects, subjects' baseline char-
163
acteristics, preventive modality, as well as the reviewer authors' main
164
results and conclusions were extracted from the included reviews.
165
Data extracted by one reviewer (DS) were independently verified by a
166
second reviewer (MZ). A third reviewer (SS) arbitrated discrepancies.
167
2.4. Data synthesis
168
Due to the heterogeneity in the study subjects' baseline characteris-
169
tics, types of intervention, and outcome measures, quantitative meta-
170
analysis was not deemed suitable. Therefore, a descriptive, qualitative
171
knowledge synthesis was conducted. Reviews were categorized based
172
on intervention type, outcome measure, and baseline characteristics.
173
Additionally, to facilitate data synthesis, interventions were considered
174
as primary or secondary prevention in accordance with subjects' base-
175
line characteristics and outcome measures reported. Interventions
176
aimed at subjects with no history of back pain were categorized as pri-
177
mary prevention; when subjects had previous back pain, but did not
178
demonstrate current back pain at study baseline, interventions were
179
considered secondary prevention. We assigned to a third category of
180
mixed primary and secondary prevention those reviews where review
181
authors did not explicitly describe subjects' baseline characteristics
182
in that regard. Furthermore, when a review described interventions
183
for both LBP prevention and treatment, we only extracted data related
184
to prevention.
185
3. Results
186
The electronic searches yielded 925 hits and 13 additional records
187
were obtained from the references lists of the included reviews; 838 re-
188
cords were screened after deduplication. Following abstract screening,
189
66 full-text review articles were selected for further evaluation; exam-
190
ining these full-text articles resulted in the exclusion of 38 articles,
191
thus leaving 28 systematic reviews that were included in our overview
192
(Fig. 1). The publication dates of the included reviews ranged from 1994
193
to 2016.
194
All review articles were systematic reviews with or without meta-
195
analyses with 27 articles in English and one in German. The main
196
reasons for exclusion were that articles were narrative reviews, not
197
systematic reviews, that interventions were therapeutic rather than
198
preventive or that some of the articles were previous versions of

199
updated reviews and, in such cases, only the most recent review was
200
included. A list of excluded articles and reasons for exclusion are
201
presented in Appendix Table 1 (provided in the Appendix).
202
3.1. Methodological quality assessment
203
The assessment of the methodological quality of the 28 included re-
204
views was performed based on the AMSTAR tool in the form adapted by
205
Moore, Derry, Aldington, & Wiffen (2015) This showed that 14 reviews
206
were of high, 10 of moderate and 4 of low quality (Appendix Table 2,
207
again provided in the Appendix). Of the 11 criteria, all included reviews
208
performed poorly on the question “Was the likelihood of publication bias
209
assessed?”. Except for seven reviews, which listed all included and ex-
210
cluded studies, all the other 21 reviews reported details only on the in-
211
cluded studies.
212
3.2. Categorization of interventions
213
Reviews were classified as primary prevention, secondary prevention,
214
or mixed primary and secondary prevention based on study subjects'
215
baseline characteristics (Tables 1 and 2). Six reviews reported on primary
216
prevention, 19 reviews reported on secondary prevention, and three
217
reviews reported on mixed primary and secondary prevention.
218
For primary prevention, the main outcome measure considered was
219
the incidence of new LBP. The primary outcome of interest for second-
220
ary prevention interventions was the recurrence (or absence thereof)
221
of LBP. Secondary outcome measures such as cost and absenteeism
222
due to LBP (sick leave) were also assessed.
223
Furthermore, to enable effective comparison between different
224
interventions, all reported interventions were categorized under three
225
broad groups: (1) devices, technologies or workplace modifications;
226
(2) educational and behavioral interventions; and (3) exercise.
227
As shown in Appendix Table 3, there was a high degree of heteroge-
228
neity regarding the baseline characteristics of subjects, the intervention
229
type, its duration, frequency, and intensity. In addition, the outcome
230
measures assessed for a given intervention and the follow-up periods
231
differed significantly between the individual studies contained in the
232
systematic reviews we investigated. Thus, we deemed it appropriate
233
to perform a descriptive and qualitative data synthesis.
234
3.3. Devices, technologies and workplace modifications
235
This category comprised all interventions that employ the use of
236
appliances, devices, or equipment for the prevention of LBP in the work-
237
place. These devices aim to limit biomechanical strain on the back in
238
occupational settings where workers are predisposed to LBP. As
239
shown in Table 1 and Appendix Table 3, the interventions identified in
240
this category include lumbar supports and other assistive devices
241
(back belts, braces, corsets) (15 reviews), shoe insoles (4 reviews),
242
and workplace/risk factor modifications (6 reviews). The 15 reviews
243
that reported on lumbar supports and other assistive devices comprised
244
a total of 18 primary studies and more than 60,678 study subjects (three
245
of the studies did not report the number of subjects). Six primary
246
studies with 2,356 subjects were included in the four reviews that re-
247
ported on shoe insoles or orthoses. Reviews that described workplace
248
modification interventions also included risk factor modifications,
249
which were reported in three of six reviews (10 studies, 6,751 subjects).
250
In the other three reviews (Lahad et al., 1994; Linton & van Tulder,
251
2001; Verbeek & Ivanov, 2013) workplace modification was classified
252
as an intervention for the prevention of LBP, but none of these three
253
identified any studies reporting this intervention strategy.
254
Two high quality reviews and one review of moderate quality
255
reported on the effectiveness of lumbar support and other assistive
256
devices for the primary prevention of LBP (Bigos et al., 2009; Curran
257
et al., 2015; Verbeek et al., 2011). The type of lumbar supports consid-
258
ered included back belts and chair backrests. In two reviews (Bigos
259
et al., 2009; Verbeek et al., 2011) (5 studies, 9,156 subjects), back belts
260
did not demonstrate efficacy for the prevention of LBP when compared
261
with no intervention (4,635 subjects) or other interventions such as
262
education alone (8,471 subjects). In one review that investigated the
263
use of chair backrests and reducing seated hip flexion, there was limited
264
evidence that chair backrests were preventive against low back discom-
265
fort (seven studies, number of subjects was not provided) and no evi-
266
dence that chairs that promoted hip flexion reduced LBP or low back
267
discomfort (21 studies, 675 subjects). Also, O'Sullivan et al. (2012)
268
(7 studies, 471 subjects) demonstrated that dynamic sitting using dy-
269
namic chairs was not effective for the prevention of LBP.
270
Four high quality (Dawson et al., 2007; Steffens et al., 2016; van
271
Duijvenbode et al., 2008; van Poppel et al., 2004), five moderate quality
272
(Ammendolia et al., 2005; Lahad et al., 1994; Linton & van Tulder, 2001;
273
Maher, 2000; Tveito et al., 2004) and one low quality (Karas & Conrad,
274
1996) reviews investigated the efficacy of lumbar supports and assistive
275
devices in subjects with mixed baseline characteristics (mixed primary
276
and secondary prevention). Specific lumbar support devices included
277
back belts (Ammendolia et al., 2005), lumbar braces (Maher, 2000)
278
and corsets (Lahad et al., 1994). There was consistent evidence among
279
all reviews in this category (10 studies, 15,521 subjects) that lumbar
280
supports were not effective in reducing episodes, prevalence, or severity
281
of LBP, nor sick leave due to LBP. In both short term (up to 12 months)
282
and long term (N12 months) studies, back belts had no significant
283
impact on the incidence or episode of LBP, sick leave or costs associ-
284
ated with LBP, compared to no intervention or other interventions.
285
When employed as a supplement to back schools, one review (1 study,
286
82 subjects) reported that there was limited evidence that lumbar sup-
287
ports reduced the number of days lost from work due to back injury
288
compared to back schools alone (van Duijvenbode et al., 2008) but no ef-
289
fect on the incidence of LBP was found. When combined with usual care
290
in that same review (van Duijvenbode et al., 2008), lumbar supports re-
291
duced the number of days with LBP and improved functional status in
292
the long term better than usual care alone, but did not reduce long
293
term sick leave (1 study, 360 subjects). One review (Gatty et al., 2003)
294
of moderate quality (4 studies, 45,479 subjects), which did not describe
295
the baseline characteristics of subjects, showed that the evidence on the
296
effectiveness of back belts in the prevention of LBP was inconclusive.
297
Of the four reviews that reported on the impart of shoe insoles in the
298
prevention of LBP, three were of high quality (Chuter et al., 2014; Sahar
299
et al., 2007; Steffens et al., 2016) while one was of moderate quality
300
(Bigos et al., 2009). Two of the high quality reviews (Chuter et al.,
301
2014; Sahar et al., 2007) and the moderate quality (Bigos et al., 2009)
302
review reported on subjects without LBP (6 studies, 2,356 subjects).
303
Findings from Bigos et al. (2009) revealed no difference in the preven-
304
tion of LBP between shoe orthoses (semi-rigid), shoe orthoses (soft)
305
or simple shoe inserts. The review by Chuter et al. (2014) also demon-
306
strated no statistically significant difference between shoe orthoses
307
and a control group in the risk of developing LBP.
308
In a mixed (primary and secondary prevention) population of
309
subjects, Sahar et al. (2007) demonstrated strong evidence that
310
non-customized insoles are no more effective than no intervention
311
in the prevention of LBP. Also, one high quality review by Steffens
312
et al. (2016) found low quality evidence of no protective effect of shoe
313
insoles on episodes of LBP in the short term. Thus, the overall findings
314
from these four reviews present no convincing evidence that shoe in-
315
soles or foot orthoses are effective in preventing LBP in either pain-
316
free subjects or subjects of a mixed primary and secondary prevention
317
population.
318
The last group in this category of interventions is workplace modifi-
319
cations. In the present context of preventing LBP, these interventions
320
described strategies at the workplace intended to minimize risk factors,
321
which may predispose employees to the development of LBP. Overall,
322
four reviews, (Gatty et al., 2003; Lahad et al., 1994; Linton & van
323
Tulder, 2001; Maher, 2000) all of moderate quality (Table 2), were
324
identified which reported on these preventive interventions. Two of

the reviews (Lahad et al., 1994; Linton & van Tulder, 2001) did not iden-
326
tify any trials evaluating the effectiveness of these strategies in LBP
327
prevention. The other two reviews (Gatty et al., 2003; Maher, 2000)
328
(7 studies, more than 6,484 subjects; number of subjects was not
329
reported by one study) described interventions to modify risk factors
330
at the workplace including task modification. The specific interven-
331
tions intended to modify such workplace risk factors as lifting, physi-
332
cally heavy work, a static posture, frequent bending and twisting,
333
repetitive work, and exposure to vibration. Driessen et al. (3 studies,
334
1,100 subjects) showed that workplace interventions, which included
335
training about workplace adjustments, a participatory program insti-
336
tuting workplace changes, and computer workplace adjustments,
337
were no more effective in the prevention of LBP than no interventions
338
in the short term (up to 12 months). In the long term (N12 months),
339
likewise, physical workplace modification intervention was not effec-
340
tive in the prevention of LBP (one study, 504 subjects). Steffens et al.
341
(2016) (two studies, 3,536 subjects) and Verbeek et al. (Verbeek
342
& Ivanov, 2013) (number of subjects was not reported) did not find
343
any effect of workplace modification programs in the reduction of LBP
344
episodes. These findings provide evidence that workplace, risk or task
345
modifications are no more effective than no intervention control groups
346
in the prevention of LBP.

1) 7 studies demonstrated that exercise alone or combined with
education increased strength and flexibility of abdominal muscles
and improved symptoms resulting from back problems, reduced
number of painful months because of LBP. The number of days
absent from work and days with back-pain symptoms, as well as
incidence of new back-pain episodes were all reduced.
2) Education alone or combined with workplace programs, stress
management, lumbar support, shoe inserts or programs for reducing
lifting did not reduce prevalence and duration of episodes of LBP.
Exercise was found to be an effective

Back belt
Ammendolia
et al. (2005)
Of 5 RCTs, 3 did not show positive results with back belt use; 1 showed
decreased time loss in a training and back belt group. Subgroup analysis
suggested that this effect was seen only among workers with a previous
history of LBP. Another RCT reported a marginally significant decrease in
low back injury rates among employees receiving a back belt compared
with control group. 1 high quality cohort study did not show any
effectiveness of back belt use to prevent or reduce lost time due to LBP.
An observational study with analytical and methodological weaknesses
found positive results with back belt use on LBP. Those with a previous
history of LBP may experience some potential benefit from back belt use.
There was no conclusive evidence to
support back belt use to prevent or reduce
lost time from LBP. Individual workers
presenting with no prior history of LBP

Exercise
Choi et al.
(2010)
Post-treatment exercises (exercise interventions aimed to prevent LBP
recurrence of subjects previously treated for LBP) versus no
intervention: The 3 studies that evaluated this comparison showed that
the number of subjects with recurrences was significantly lower (RR
0.5; 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.73) at medium term follow-up in 2 studies but
not at long term follow-up (RR 0.75; 95% CI: 0.53 to 1.07). The time to
recurrence measured in one study yielded a hazard ratio of 0.43 (95%
CI: 0.21 to 0.87) at medium term follow-up. Number of recurrences
measured in two studies with mean difference of −0.35 (95% CI:
−0.60 to −0.10) at medium-term follow-up, and in one study at long
term follow-up with a MD of −1.97 (95% CI: −3.84 to −0.10).
Post-treatment exercise did not influence the number of persons on
sick leave as a result of recurrences at medium or long term follow-ups,
but did decrease the number of days on sick leave due to recurrences in
2 studies at medium-term follow-up with mean difference of −4.37
(95% CI: −7.74 to −0.99). When an additional exercise machine was
added to the post-treatment exercise, 1 study showed no effect on the
number of days on sick leave compared to general exercises.
Exercise treatment versus sham treatment: When compared to
ultra-sound sham treatment group, exercise treatment resulted in
neither fewer persons with recurrences nor a shorter duration of
recurrent back pain.
McKenzie exercises versus back pain education: McKenzie exercises
compared to back pain education did not significantly differ in the
number of subjects who had recurrences in the medium-term; there
was no significant difference in the number of days on sick leave
between the two groups.
There was moderate quality evidence that
post-treatment exercises were more
effective compared with no intervention
in reducing the number of subjects with
recurrences at medium-term follow-up.
There was moderate quality evidence that
they were more effective at reducing the
number of recurrences of back pain at

to no intervention. There was low quality
evidence that the recurrence rate at
medium-term and at long term
follow-ups was similar between the
exercise and usual care group.
There was very low quality evidence that
McKenzie exercises are similar to back
pain education at reducing recurrences of
back pain at medium-term follow-up and
very low quality evidence that the
number of sick leave days is similar after
pain education in the medium and long

There was strong evidence that a booklet increases knowledge and

that a biopsychosocial booklet was more effective than a biomedical
booklet to shift subjects' beliefs about physical activity, pain and
associated consequences. There was strong evidence that booklets
were not efficient on absenteeism, but there was conflicting evidence
that they were efficient on healthcare use. There was no evidence that
email discussion or video programs alone were effective to reduce LBP,
disability, or healthcare costs. Nevertheless, information delivery alone
was not sufficient to prevent absenteeism and reduce healthcare costs.
To shift subjects' beliefs on LBP,
biopsychosocial-based information was
recommended, although it was
inadequate to prevent absenteeism and

All four programs showed generally positive results.
Back belt: Of the 4 back belt programs, 1 study reported a decrease in the
number of back injuries and 1 reported no change. 2 studies reported a
reduction in lost time. 1 study reported no change in abdominal strength.
Back school programs: 2 studies reported a reduction in back injury
rates. 1 study reported a decrease in lost time, and 1 reported no
change. 1 study showed no change in costs. 1 study each showed an
increase in flexibility and body mechanic usage scores (measure of
the positioning of the body while moving, lifting, lowering, pulling or
transferring objects or patients), respectively.
Exercise/flexibility: 2 studies each reported a decrease in back injury
and lost time, respectively. 3 studies reported a decrease in cost and
3 reported an increase in muscle flexibility. 2 studies reported an increase
in exercise behavior while 1 reported an increase in body mechanic usage.
Education programs: Of the 3 education programs, 1 study reported a
decrease in the back injury rate, utilizing a combination of an
education program and administrative program.
All interventions demonstrated positive
effects on the prevention of LBP.
Exercise/flexibility intervention was more
effective in the prevention of LBP

Lahad et al.

Exercise: All 16 RCTs showed a statistically significant short term

because of back pain or fewer days with back pain than controls.
None of the studies followed up subjects beyond 18 months. 7
studies observed significant associations between increased fitness
or flexibility and decreased LBP, but 4 found no protective effect.
Education: Of 5 RCTs 1, which combined education with an exercise,
program reported a significant decrease in subsequent LBP. 4 of the
trials reported negative overall results, but significant differences in
intermediate outcomes were observed in 3 of the 4.
Mechanical supports: 1 study showed no difference in mean rates of
work lost between subjects in belt-only group and controls, nor between
subjects in the belt-and-training group and controls. Compliance to wear
corsets was 42% in this study. In another study, a corset plus education
group had a significantly greater increase in knowledge and decrease in
days lost from work compared to education alone or no intervention
group. There were no differences in changes in abdominal strength,
productivity, and rates of injuries between the groups.
Exercise interventions may be mildly
protective against back pain. Aerobic
exercise appeared to be as effective as
exercises aimed at trunk muscles. There
was limited evidence to recommend
exercise to prevent LBP in asymptomatic
individuals, and there was insufficient
evidence to recommend other prevention
strategies. There was minimal support for
use of educational strategies to prevent
LBP. There was insufficient evidence to
recommend use of mechanical supports

Back schools and education: 6 of 8 RCTs did not find any significance
differences on any of the outcome variables compared between back
school intervention and usual care or no intervention or between
different types of back schools. Only 1 RCT reported a significant
positive effect on initial sick leave and duration of symptoms. 3 of 5
non-randomized controlled trials reported positive results on at least
one variable.
Lumbar supports: 4 RCTs and 2 non-randomized controlled trials.
Results of 3 RCTs showed no significant differences on any of the
outcome measures when lumbar supports were compared with no
intervention. No effect was shown when compared with training or
education on anatomy and body mechanics, and lifting instructions.
The remaining RCT did not find any differences between lumbar
supports and training on LBP prevention versus training only, but the
supports reduced the number of days lost from work when
compared with no intervention. The non-randomized controlled
trials showed positive results for lumbar supports on the incidence of
back pain and injury. Most of the subjects did not comply with
wearing the lumbar supports.
Exercises: 4 of the 5 studies comparing exercises with no intervention
showed that exercises significantly reduced LBP and reduced work
absenteeism. Findings from 1 study were inconsistent, but the
between-group analysis by authors may not have been sufficient. 1 study
showed that exercises were more effective than back school. Another
study found little support for a preventive effect of exercise on pain

Exercise: 4 of the 5 RCTs were low quality and 1 was high quality. 3 of
the 4 low quality trials showed exercise reduced LBP prevalence. 1
high quality and 1 low quality trial found that exercise reduced the
severity of LBP. 3 of 4 trials (including the high quality trial) showed
exercise reduced sick leave. 1 RCT (of low methodological quality)
that compared exercise with back school provided no dependable
evidence on the effectiveness of either intervention.
Lumbar braces: 4 trials evaluated efficacy of lumbar braces, 3 of 4
comparing a brace with a no brace control, and 3 of 4 evaluating the brace
as a supplement to an education program. The use of braces alone or as a
supplement to an education program was not effective in the prevention
of LBP, LBP severity, sick leave due to LBP or costs of LBP compared to a no
brace control. 1 low quality trial found that while the brace did not reduce
the prevalence of LBP, it did reduce sick leave due to LBP.
Education: 6 RCTs (4 of the trials also considered other preventive
interventions already accounted for above). 2 trials evaluated
efficacy of education as a supplement to lumbar brace and found no
effect for LBP prevalence, severity, sick leave or costs due to LBP.
Negative results were also found. In the trials that compared
education with no intervention group, 10 of the 12 outcome
comparisons demonstrated no effect for education.
Workplace modification and education: 2 RCTs (1 reported more than
4,000 subjects for both groups and the other reported 205 for both
groups). Both trials were of low quality and one trial did not provide any
statistical analysis of results. Thus, there was no evidence for or against
an effect of workplace modification and education on LBP prevalence.
Exercise was the only workplace
intervention, which was effective to
prevent LBP. Other interventions were
either not effective or analysis were not
adequately conducted. There was limited
evidence that exercise reduces the
prevalence of LBP. There was moderate
evidence that exercise reduces sick leave
due to LBP.
There was limited evidence that braces
were not effective in reducing the costs

Significant effect of back schools on recurrence of back pain was

The number of studies or subjects with no LBP baseline were not
provided. Likely, many would have previously had LBP, but the
parameter of ‘recurrence of back pain’ implicitly refers to subjects
without LBP at baseline; for such subjects the intervention was
considered secondary prevention.
In a time-limited fashion, back schools

follow-up (RR 0.72; 95% CI: 0.48 to 1.08), respectively.
Education vs control, minimal intervention, or other intervention: 3
trials at short term follow-up and 2 trials at long term follow-up (LBP
episode) provided moderate quality evidence of no protective effect
of education at either short term follow-up (RR 1.03; 95% CI: 0.83 to
1.27) or long term follow-up (RR 0.86; 95% CI: 0.72 to 1.04). A single
trial, not included in the meta-analysis, provided moderate quality
evidence of no protective effect of education at long term follow-up
(RR 1.11; 95% CI: 0.90 to 1.37). 2 trials provided very low quality
evidence of no protective effect of education on sick leave due to LBP
at short term follow-up (RR 0.87; 95% CI: 0.47 to 1.60).
Back Belt vs control, minimal intervention, or other intervention: 2
trials showed very low quality evidence of no short term effect of
back belts over controls (RR 1.01; 95% CI: 0.71 to 1.44). At long term
follow-up, a single trial provided moderate quality evidence that
back belts do not reduce the risk of LBP episodes when compared
with controls (RR 0.85; 95% CI: 0.64 to 1.14). A single trial provided
low quality evidence of no effect of back belts compared with
controls at short term follow-up (RR 1.44; 95% CI: 0.73 to 2.86).
Shoe Insole vs control, minimal intervention, or other intervention:
4 trials showed low quality evidence that shoe insoles did not
prevent LBP versus control at short term follow-up (RR 1.01; 95% CI:
0.74 to 1.40).
Other LBP prevention strategies: A workplace program (moderate
quality evidence) was not effective in reducing episodes of LBP at
short term follow-up compared to controls (OR 1.23; 95% CI: 0.97 to
1.57). Due to very low quality evidence (RR 0.95; 95% CI: 0.51 to
1.76) it was unclear whether LBP-associated sick leave can be
prevented by education, training, or ergonomic adjustments.
There was low quality evidence that
exercise alone was effective in the
prevention of LBP. There was moderate
quality evidence that exercise in
combination with education was effective
in the prevention of LBP. The evidence for
other interventions, including education
alone, back belts, and shoe insoles, was
inconclusive because of low quality
studies.
The effect of education, training, or
workplace adjustments on prevention of
sick leave is uncertain, because the
quality of evidence is low.

Educational interventions: 10 studies. Out of 6 studies reporting on
sick leave due to LBP, 2 studies reported a non-significant positive
effect in the intervention vs the control groups. Regarding costs, 3 of
4 studies reported a significantly positive effect and 1 study did not
find any significant effects on costs. 2 out of 6 studies showed
educational intervention reduced episodes of LBP. 1 study showed a
significant reduction in pain in the intervention group compared to
controls while two studies did not find any significant difference in
pain between the groups.
Exercise: 6 studies. 2 studies showed that exercise had a significant
effective on sick leave, but with a risk of selection bias and low scores
on internal validity. 2 studies showed that exercise had a significant
cost savings. 3 studies reported a significant effect of exercise on new
episodes of LBP. 3 studies showed no significant differences between
exercise and control group on pain due to LBP.
Back belt: 5 studies with low compliance. 1 study demonstrated a
significantly positive effect of back belt on sick leave compared to the
control group while 2 studies did not find any significant differences.
1 study found no significant effect of back belt on costs. 2 studies
found no effect of back belts on new episodes of LBP; one study
showed a significant effect but had a low methodological score.
Multidisciplinary interventions: Of 2 studies, 1 study found no
significant difference between the 2 groups on sick leave, but
demonstrated a clinically important positive effect on the level of
pain. The other study showed positive effects on costs and new
episodes of LBP.
Pamphlet: 1 methodologically weak study showed no significant
difference between a pamphlet and control group on LBP-associated
sick leave.
There was a non-significantly positive
effect of education on sick leave.
Educational interventions did not reduce
costs due to LBP.
There was limited evidence for no effect
of educational interventions on new
episodes of LBP. There was no evidence
for an effect of educational interventions
on pain levels. There was limited
evidence for a positive effect from
exercise on sick leave, costs, and new
episodes of LBP.
There was no evidence of effect of
exercise on level of pain.
There was limited evidence that
multidisciplinary interventions have no
effect on sick leave, no evidence for effect
on costs or new episodes of LBP, and
limited evidence of effect on level of pain.
In addition, there was no evidence of the
effect of an information pamphlet on sick
leave due to LBP.

Lumbar supports
van
Duijvenbode
et al. (2008)
3 of 5 studies, one of high quality, comparing lumbar supports with
a no intervention group, reported no significant differences in long
term back injury or incidence of LBP. 1 study used 2 control groups:
1 group had a safety meeting with information about low-back
health and the other group was passively followed and not
informed about the study. The study reported a difference in long
term back injury between those who wore lumbar supports and the
control informed group, and no significant differences between
those who wore lumbar supports and the advice group. Concerning
short term
(b12 months) sick leave, 1 study did not find any significant
difference between the group that wore lumbar supports and the
advice group. 3 RCTs did not find any significant difference in long
term (N12 months) sick leave between those who wore lumbar
supports and those who had no intervention.
When compared to other prevention interventions, lumbar supports
did not lead to significant differences between intervention and
control groups assessing LBP incidence and sick leave due to LBP for
long term period.
When lumbar support plus back school was compared to back school
alone, 1 study found significant differences in the number of days
lost from work due to back injury in the long term but no significant
differences in the incidence of LBP. A study on lumbar support plus
usual care versus usual care alone found significant differences of the
former group versus the latter group in the number of days with LBP
and functional status in the long term, but no significant effect in
long term sick leave.
There was moderate evidence that
lumbar supports did not prevent short
and long term incidence of LBP or sick
leave when comparing lumbar support
groups and no intervention groups. There
was moderate evidence that lumbar
supports were not more effective than
training in lifting techniques to prevent
long term LBP and sick leave. There was
limited evidence that lumbar supports
plus back school reduced the number of
days lost from work due to back injury in
the long term more than back school
alone, but not affecting the incidence of
LBP. There was limited evidence that
lumbar supports plus usual care reduced
the number of days with LBP and improve
functional status in the long term better
than usual care alone, but were not better
at reducing long term sick leave.

van Poppel

Lumbar supports: 1 of 4 RCTs reported that in combination with
education, lumbar support had a positive effect on the number of
days lost from work but not on the incidence of LBP. The other
3 RCTs and non-randomized controlled trials reported no
significant effect of lumbar supports on incidence of LBP or sick
leave. 2 RCTs reported that subjects at high risk for LBP due to a
history of back pain benefited from lumbar supports compared
to control intervention. Compliance to wear lumbar supports was
very low.
Education: None of 6 RCTs showed any significant effect of education
on reduction of back pain incidence or absenteeism.
Exercise: All 4 RCTs reported that exercise reduces incidence of LBP,
although the effect was not always statistically significant.
There was no evidence for the effect of
lumbar supports in the prevention of LBP.
There was no evidence of effectiveness of
education for prevention of back pain.
There was limited evidence for the

Behavioral interventions
Verbeek and
Ivanov
(2013)
Environmental interventions: A review on the effectiveness of
participatory ergonomic interventions included 7 studies with mixed
results, but the authors concluded that participatory interventions
were effective. A more recent review of ergonomic interventions to
prevent back pain in workers included 10 RCTs and concluded that
these interventions were no more effective than no intervention.
Behavioral interventions: 6 RCTs of education for correct lifting
showed no evidence of a preventive effect on back pain. Training in
manual handling of patients or materials does not lead to a reduction
of back pain or back injury.
This is a review of reviews. The available
reviews did not provide evidence that
back pain can be prevented by the
investigated.

Educational training was not effective in reducing LBP. Workplace
and laboratory intervention showed MMH training did not prevent
the development of LBP.
Exercise training at the workplace showed promise to prevent back
injuries.
There was very little evidence for the
effectiveness of educational- and
technique-based manual handling
training in all industries. MMH training
was largely ineffective in reducing back
pain and back injury. Exercise
interventions showed promise in the

Back belt: 4 studies. No significant difference in number of
self-reported back injuries or LBP was identified between the
groups. Another study reported a 34% decrease in back injury rates
between years with no back support use (30.6 units of
incidence/million working hours) and years with back support use
(20.2 units of incidence/million working hours). One study showed
that back belt use reduced the number of days per month of
reported back pain compared to the no back belt group, 1.2 vs.
6.5 days per month; 62% indicated that back belts provided support
for the back. Another study found no significant differences in back
pain (OR 0.99; 95% CI: 0.85 to 1.14) and back injury claims (RR
1.20; 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.65) between a ‘high compliance level’ and a
‘low compliance level’ groups. No significant differences were
reported in back pain (OR 0.81; 95% CI: 0.82 to 2.84) and back
injury claims (RR 1.53; 95% CI: 0.58 to 1.14) between the two
compliance level groups for the subgroup of heavy material
handlers.
The effectiveness of back belt to prevent
back pain and injury remained
inconclusive. Positive outcomes were
associated with studies reporting high
compliance that used job-specific and
individualized/small group education and
training approaches.

353
causes of LBP. This primarily enables workers to develop abilities to
354
adapt to the work environment, which may ultimately lead to preven-
355
tion of occupationally induced LBP (Deyo & Diehl, 1988). The different
356
forms of educational interventions were described by 18 of the included
357
systematic reviews which comprised 6 high quality (Ainpradub et al.,
358
2015; Clemes et al., 2010; Dawson et al., 2007; Steffens et al., 2016;
359
van Poppel et al., 2004; Verbeek et al., 2011), 9 moderate quality
360
(Bigos et al., 2009; Demoulin et al., 2012; Gatty et al., 2003; Gebhardt,
361
1994; Henrotin et al., 2006; Lahad et al., 1994; Linton & van Tulder,
362
2001; Maher, 2000), and 3 low quality reviews (Karas & Conrad, 1996;
363
van Dieen et al., 1999; Verbeek & Ivanov, 2013). The specific interven-
364
tions reported include educational programs such as back schools
365
(30 studies, more than 9,973 subjects; number of subjects not described
366
in one study), manual material handling (MMH) techniques or advice
367
(24 studies, 10,505 subjects), and other types of instruction (14 studies
368
with 11,991 subjects) including pamphlets, booklets, videos, and
369
e-mail discussions aimed at providing knowledge on how to prevent
370
LBP at the workplace (Table 1).
371
Of the included reviews in this category, two (one of high quality
372
(Verbeek et al., 2011) and the other of moderate quality (Bigos et al.,
373
2009)) reported on educational interventions in subjects with no
374
history of LBP. Findings from Verbeek et al. (2011) demonstrated
375
that MMH advice in the intermediate term (3 to 12 months) or long
376
term (N12 months) did not change the incidence of back pain and the
377
back injury rate compared to no intervention (5 studies, 13,926 subjects).
378
Additionally, these authors showed that MMH advice was not effective
379
in preventing back-related disability at intermediate term follow-up
380
(3 to 12 months). There were no statistically significant differences in
381
the incidence of back pain and back pain-related disability between an
382
extensive MMH training group and a group that received minor advice.
383
In addition, for subjects who received MMH advice, there was no statis-
384
tically significant difference compared to a back belt group in the inci-
385
dence of back pain (2 studies, 658 subjects). When MMH advice was
386
combined with MMH devices, there was again no statistically signifi-
387
cant difference in the incidence of back pain or back-related disability
388
compared to MMH advice alone or a no intervention group (1 study,
389
346 subjects). In support of these findings, Bigos et al. (2009) also
390
showed that back education as well as MMH training were not effective
391
in the prevention of LBP (4 studies, 1,982 subjects). Altogether, these
392
findings demonstrate that MMH training and advice are not effective
393
in the prevention of LBP incidence and LBP associated disability.
394
Thirteen reviews also investigated the effect of education and be-
395
havioral interventions in the prevention of LBP in a mixed primary pre-
396
vention and secondary prevention population of subjects. Four of the
397
reviews were of high quality (Ainpradub et al., 2015; Dawson et al.,
398
2007; Steffens et al., 2016; van Poppel et al., 2004), seven were moder-

Education and task modification: 3 studies (702 subjects; 1 study did not
report the number of subjects). One study on nurses showed that 1
year post a 3-year combined education training program led to a
significant increase in the frequency of registered nurses' (~48%–~60%)
reporting back pain (p = 0.007). There was no significant change in
frequency of state enrolled nurses compared to auxiliary nurses
reporting pain. Another study where lift teams were implemented to
reduce lifts by nurses led to a 69% decrease in the number of lift-related
back injuries, a 90% decrease in lost workdays, a decrease in LBP
incidence by 62.5%, a decrease in compensation costs due to LBP by
31%–100%. In another study, back injuries decreased from 5 to 6 to
1–2 per year within the Offshore Business Unit Wellness Program
(OBUWP) group of a subset of Amoco Corporation. However, there was
no statistically significant difference between OBUWP and Amoco
Corporation's back injury rates.
Education and task modification with workstation redesign: Two studies.
There was a statistically significant increase in the knowledge of safe
work behaviors in experimental vs. control workers at midpoint of
intervention. No statistically significant difference in rate of
task-specific back injuries between intervention and control groups
(RR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.3) was reported. The proportion of back
injuries resulting in lost workdays was 61% for the intervention group
and 56% for the control group. In another study, there was a
statistically significant (p = 0.01) gain in knowledge of occupational
risk factors related to back injury. Trainees in the low patient transfer
departments who received the intervention reported significantly
fewer back pain days (p = 0.024) than controls in same departments.
There was a 30% reduction in the number of lost time back injuries for
all employees, pre to post-training, and a 73% decrease in the number
of lost workdays per back injury for all employees pre to post-training.
No significant difference was found in the number of back pain days
(p = 0.69) between trainees and controls in the high patient transfer
departments.

Mixed prevention
van Dieen
et al. (1999)
There was no statistically significant difference between the stoop or
squat technique in the prevalence of LBP.
Squat lifting may be advantageous for a limited range of lifting tasks
in which the load can be lifted from between the feet (up to 34%
reduction in net moment).
Available evidence did not provide
support for advocating the squat
technique as a means of preventing LBP
compared to the stoop technique.

included back schools where workers were taught anatomy and func-
404
tion of the back, advised on how to perform work with minimal me-
405
chanical constraints, especially proper lifting techniques, as well
406
as promoting specific back exercises (Ainpradub et al., 2015). Other
407
forms of information include booklets, leaflets, books, and videos,
408
aimed at increasing subjects' knowledge about LBP (Henrotin et al.,
409
2006). All the 13 reviews in this category demonstrated that educa-
410
tional programs were not effective in reducing the incidence and
411
prevalence of LBP. However, there was limited evidence that educa-
412
tional interventions were effective in reducing costs and absenteeism
413
compared to no intervention or other interventions. The reviews consis-
414
tently showed that the educational intervention groups were more
415
knowledgeable about LBP and back dynamics following the study
416
period compared to the no intervention group. However, this knowl-
417
edge did not seem to translate into the prevention of LBP and related
418
disability.
419
Three reviews (one each of high (Clemes et al., 2010), medium
420
(Gatty et al., 2003), and low methodological quality (van Dieen
421
et al., 1999)) also reported on the effect of educational intervention
422
in the prevention of back pain in a mixed primary prevention and sec-
423
ondary prevention population of subjects. Interventions consisted of
424
both manual handling training techniques and instructions or advice
425
on lifting strategy. All three reviews did not find that training and in-
426
structions on lifting were effective interventions for the prevention of
427
LBP and back-related injuries. Van Dieen et al. (1999) (24 studies,
428
more than 513 subjects, three studies did not report the number of
429
subjects) compared two types of lifting techniques, the stoop versus
430
squat lifting techniques, and provided no evidence to support either
431
technique as an effective lifting strategy to prevent LBP over the other
432
(Table 2).
433
3.5. Exercise
434
Of the 28 reviews included in this overview, 12 described exercise
435
interventions (35 studies with 19,330 subjects); 5 of the reviews were
436
of high quality (Bell & Burnett, 2009; Choi et al., 2010; Dawson et al.,
437
2007; Steffens et al., 2016; van Poppel et al., 2004), 6 were of moderate
438
quality (Bigos et al., 2009; Gebhardt, 1994; Lahad et al., 1994; Linton
439
& van Tulder, 2001; Maher, 2000; Tveito et al., 2004), and 1 was of
440
low quality (Karas & Conrad, 1996). Although the type of exercise inter-
441
ventions and duration varied between studies, they were all aimed
442
at preventing LBP and related disability. The specific exercise regimen
443
reported in the reviews included strengthening and endurance
444
(abdominal and back extensor muscles), stability and flexibility, calis-
445
thenics (exercises without the use of equipment), stretching, and
446
cardiovascular fitness exercises. The duration and frequency of the
447
exercise programs varied considerably from 3 months follow–up to
448
18 months follow–up, and 5 min to 60 min per session.
449
One high quality (Bell & Burnett, 2009) and one medium quality
450
(Bigos et al., 2009) review (15 studies, 7,002 subjects) provided evi-
451
dence of the effect of exercise on LBP in subjects with no LBP at baseline.
452
Both reviews demonstrated moderate quality evidence of exercise to
453
prevent episodes of LBP in the workplace.
454
Ten reviews described the effectiveness of exercise in the prevention
455
of LBP in subjects with mixed characteristics at baseline (i.e., with or
456
without a history of LBP). Three reviews were of high quality (Dawson
457
et al., 2007; Steffens et al., 2016; van Poppel et al., 2004), six were of
458
moderate quality (Choi et al., 2010; Gebhardt, 1994; Lahad et al.,
459
1994; Linton & van Tulder, 2001; Maher, 2000; Tveito et al., 2004)
460
while one was of low quality (Karas & Conrad, 1996) (16 studies,
461
8,905 subjects). All the reviews with the exception of one (Dawson
462
et al., 2007) provided moderate quality evidence of a protective effect
463
of exercise for the prevention of LBP. Exercise interventions were
464
shown to be effective in the reduction of sick leave, incidence of LBP,
465
and LBP recurrence (Choi et al., 2010). The one exception (Dawson
466
et al., 2007), which showed that exercise programs were not effective
467
in the prevention of LBP, was of moderate quality. Choi et al. (2010)
468
demonstrated that exercise interventions following an episode of LBP,
469
were effective in the reduction of the rate of recurrences at one year
470
compared to no intervention (4 studies with 407 subjects). Regarding
471
the follow-up period, the protective effect of exercise interventions in
472
reducing incident cases of LBP was demonstrated in the short term
473
(up to 12 months) when compared with no intervention (Steffens
474
et al., 2016). There was low quality evidence of no long-term effect of
475
exercise on LBP incidence, although the risk of sick leave due to LBP
476
was reduced by exercise in the long term (N12 months) (Steffens
477
et al., 2016). Although the overall methodological quality of the exercise
478
programs in LBP prevention was moderate based on AMSTAR, the pri-
479
mary studies from which the conclusion was drawn were of low quality,
480
as assessed by the review authors employing the method recom-
481
mended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (Furlan, Malmivaara,
482
Chou, et al., 2015; van Tulder et al., 2003).
483
When an exercise program was combined with education, there was
484
moderate quality evidence that exercise and education reduced the
485
risk of LBP episode during short term follow-up compared to control
486
or minimal interventions (Bell & Burnett, 2009; Bigos et al., 2009;
487
Steffens et al., 2016). During long-term follow-up, the evidence for effi-
488
cacy of exercise in the prevention of LBP and accompanying disabilities
489
of exercise was of low quality (Bell & Burnett, 2009; Bigos et al., 2009;
490
Steffens et al., 2016).
491
4. Discussion
492
Low back pain is a multifactorial and debilitating disorder with high
493
prevalence, exerting a huge socioeconomic burden on individuals and
494
health care systems. In the present overview, various interventions
495
aimed at the prevention of LBP that can be conducted at the workplace
496
were assessed. The respective interventions were categorized into
497
either primary or secondary prevention approaches based on the base-
498
line characteristics of the study subjects. For primary prevention, the
499
outcome measures assessed included incidence and prevalence of LBP
500
while secondary prevention outcome measures included recurrence
501
of LBP. In both cases, the impact of LBP, disability (such as work absen-
502
teeism and activity interference), and cost were also considered as
503
outcomes. Our overview demonstrates that exercise alone or in combi-
504
nation with education was the only approach that could consistently be
505
shown to be effective in the prevention of LBP.
506
Significant heterogeneity exists between the individual studies that
507
were included in the systematic reviews, which we included in our
508
overview. Specifically, heterogeneity exists regarding the baseline
509
characteristics, the specific prevention intervention, comparison
510
group, outcome measures, and outcome assessment time points
511
(short-term and long-term). The heterogeneity between studies may
512
be attributable partly to the systematic review methods employed
513
by the review authors and, in particular, their eligibility criteria for
514
study inclusion. One can speculate that permissive inclusion criteria
515
may have been informed by the relative dearth of (high-quality)
516
studies. After thorough consideration of the available data, quantitative
517
meta-analysis did not appear meaningful and was therefore not under-
518
taken. We acknowledge that this is a limitation to our information
519
synthesis.
520
Regarding the use of assistive devices and other technologies, the
521
findings in the overview overall showed no evidence of a preventive
522
effect. Lumbar support as an approach to prevent LBP in the workplace
523
has recently gained popularity but the evidence to support its applica-
524
tion is, at best, conflicting (Ammendolia et al., 2005; Jellema, Van
525
Tulder, Van Poppel, Nachemson, & Bouter, 2001; Linton & van Tulder,
526
2001). In keeping with our findings, both the U.S. National Institute
527
for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Canadian Centre
528
for Occupational Health and Safety recommend against the use of
529
back belts as a preventive measure at the workplace (Canadian Task
530
Force on Preventive Health Care, 2003; Wassell, Gardner, Landsittel,

531
Johnston, & Johnston, 2000). Furthermore, European guidelines do not
532
recommend lumbar supports for the prevention of LBP (Burton et al.,
533
2005). Methodological issues may be important in this context;
534
low compliance by study subjects to wear back belts may play a role
535
(Reddell, Congleton, Dale Huchingson, & Montgomery, 1992; van
536
Poppel, Koes, van der Ploeg, Smid, & Bouter, 1998). In addition, trials
537
that assess the effectiveness of lumbar supports on LBP have a high
538
dropout rate (Ammendolia et al., 2005). The specific lumbar supports
539
employed varied between the primary studies of the included system-
540
atic reviews. The lumbar support devices worn by study subjects
541
included braces, back belts, and corsets, worn for various time periods
542
and with different follow-up periods. The occupations of the subjects
543
ranged from hospital workers, warehouse workers, postal workers,
544
to baggage handlers. These occupational groups would all engage in
545
some form of manual handling. The findings from these studies may
546
therefore be generalizable to manual material handlers. In view of the
547
between-study heterogeneity we identified, future trials of the effec-
548
tiveness of lumbar supports should clearly define the baseline charac-
549
teristics of the study participants.
550
The rationale for the use of shoe insoles or foot orthoses stems
551
from the hypothesis that the function of the foot is linked to the etiol-
552
ogy of LBP development (Botte, 1981). It has been suggested that the
553
degree of pronation of the foot may induce a strain on the spine,
554
which may lead to LBP. Our observation demonstrated that, the four
555
reviews that evaluated the effectiveness of shoe insoles, inserts or
556
orthoses found no evidence to support their application in the work-
557
place (Bigos et al., 2009; Chuter et al., 2014; Sahar et al., 2007;
558
Steffens et al., 2016). Our overview revealed that the four systematic
559
reviews that evaluated the use of insoles and foot orthoses to prevent
560
the risk of LBP development (incidence) used the same trials to arrive
561
at the conclusion that insoles are not effective to reduce the incidence
562
of LBP. The conclusion was, however, limited by the small number of
563
included studies in the reviews, the heterogeneity that existed in the
564
design of the shoe insoles, and the variability in time period of using
565
the insoles. Moreover, the subjects in the primary studies for all
566
these reviews were mainly (presumably healthy) male military per-
567
sonnel, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to the
568
general population. Thus, the available evidence cannot definitely
569
answer the question of whether shoe insoles are effective as prevention
570
modality against LBP in other occupational settings. Future studies in
571
other occupational settings employing identical or at least substantially
572
similar shoe inserts, outcome measures, and follow-up periods may be
573
helpful to assess the overall effectiveness of insoles in the prevention
574
of LBP.
575
Workplace modification generally involves the redesign of the work
576
environment to provide a suitable space to prevent or minimize poten-
577
tial risk factors for LBP. The reduction of risk factors may occur at
578
the level of the individual or the organization (workplace setting).
579
Individual risk factors that could in theory be modified include smoking
580
(Shiri, Karppinen, Leino-Arjas, Solovieva, & Viikari-Juntura, 2010),
581
obesity, and psychological factor (Driessen et al., 2010; Lahad et al.,
582
1994). Modifiable organizational risk factors vary from the concept of
583
matching the individual to the occupational task, behavioral, and psy-
584
chological changes, to providing ergonomic interventions (Driessen
585
et al., 2010). None of the included reviews provided dependable evi-
586
dence to support an effect of workplace modification or task modifica-
587
tion intervention in the prevention of LBP. Here, it must be noted that
588
very few high quality primary studies exist to assess the effectiveness
589
of workplace modification and task modification (Driessen et al.,
590
2010; Gatty et al., 2003). Furthermore, the number of study subjects
591
in the available trials is comparatively small. This may be due to chal-
592
lenges in conducting high quality studies on this research question;
593
for example, there may be issues with conducting randomization and
594
blinding of the individual subjects. According to Driessen et al. (2010),
595
a number of factors could be attributed to the lack of effect of workplace
596
interventions for the prevention of LBP. These factors included the level
597
of exposure to the occupational risk factors, the inadequacy of the inter-
598
vention to target the important risk factors, the proper experimental
599
design, and the compliance of the experimental subjects. One may
600
also speculate that the paucity of primary studies could be due to the
601
result of lack of funding or academic interest in the field. Therefore,
602
the evidence regarding redesigning the workplace as a preventive ap-
603
proach can be regarded, at this time, as insufficient to draw definitive
604
conclusions.
605
Educational interventions were also not effective in the prevention
606
of LBP based on moderate quality evidence. The particular education in-
607
terventions identified in the present overview included back schools,
608
dissemination of information in the form of videos and pamphlets,
609
instruction, and training on proper lifting technique. Back schools
610
were originally established to offer lessons on back anatomy and dy-
611
namics as well as education on ‘proper’ exercise and lifting modalities
612
(Heymans, van Tulder, Esmail, Bombardier, & Koes, 2005). Back school
613
education has been employed as a therapeutic approach in the treat-
614
ment of LBP. However, none of the available reviews demonstrated
615
dependable evidence of efficacy for back schools in the treatment of
616
LBP (Heymans et al., 2005; Poquet, Lin, Heymans, et al., 2016; Straube,
617
Harden, Schroder, et al., 2016). In the present overview, we evaluated
618
the effectiveness of back school as a preventive strategy and similarly
619
found no dependable evidence for the prevention of LBP. An explana-
620
tion for the lack of evidence to support back schools as a preventive
621
approach may be that provision of knowledge does not necessarily
622
mean application of knowledge (St-Vincent, Tellier, & Lortie, 1989).
623
This was evidenced by studies that showed that the knowledge
624
acquired during back education was not necessarily applied at the
625
workplace (Ainpradub et al., 2015; Demoulin et al., 2012; Steffens
626
et al., 2016). Furthermore, the knowledge acquired through back
627
schools may not apply to the specific workplaces or exposures involved.
628
Although there was evidence that subjects receiving such education had
629
increased knowledge about back anatomy and occupationally-induced
630
LBP development, there was no effect on LBP prevention (Henrotin
631
et al., 2006). Similarly, instructions and training offered on proper lifting
632
techniques to manual material handlers were not effective in the pre-
633
vention of LBP.
634
Moderate quality findings from our overview indicated that exercise
635
interventions were effective in the prevention of LBP occurrence and re-
636
currence, leading to a reduction in lost time and disability associated
637
with back pain. The reasons for the effectiveness of exercise in the pre-
638
vention of LBP may relate to strengthening the back and increasing
639
trunk flexibility; increasing blood supply to the spine muscles, joints
640
and intervertebral disks; and improving mood while altering the per-
641
ception of pain (Lahad et al., 1994; Linton & van Tulder, 2001). In addi-
642
tion, exercise interventions could be effective because identifiable risk
643
factors for LBP include low levels of physical fitness (Cady, Bischoff,
644
O'Connell, Thomas, & Allan, 1979) and reduced static back muscle en-
645
durance (Luoto, Heliövaara, Hurri, & Alaranta, 1995). Other evidence
646
suggests that ‘stretch and flex’ workplace exercise programs lead to im-
647
proved safety culture and communication (Goldenhar & Stafford, 2015),
648
which may lower back injury risk.
649
In general, exercise interventions tend to strengthen and precondi-
650
tion the muscles of the back, which may lead to a reduction of the
651
factors that may predispose a subject to develop LBP. The evidence
652
further demonstrated that the effectiveness of exercise interventions
653
is apparent in the short term (up to 12 months) (Steffens et al.,
654
2016). Whether the beneficial effect of exercise in the prevention of
655
LBP can be sustained over the long term remains to be answered. In
656
addition, the type, frequency, and duration of the particular exercise
657
intervention that proved effective in the prevention of LBP and its asso-
658
ciated disability are yet to be established. Generally, aerobic exercises
659
(Lahad et al., 1994) and resistance training (Sjögren et al., 2006) were
660
reported to be effective (Bigos et al., 2009; Steffens et al., 2016). In rela-
661
tion to duration, Bigos et al. (2009) reported that 5–17 min of exercise
662
doses daily as well as 6 min of training per working day were effective

663
in the reduction of LBP incidence. Our findings are consistent with
664
European guidelines for prevention of LBP that recommended that phys-
665
ical activity and exercise be prescribed to workers (Burton, Balague,
666
Cardon, et al., 2006).
667
As seen for other preventive interventions considered above, it is
668
worth noting that the baseline characteristics of the study subjects of
669
the primary studies of the systematic reviews, which we included in
670
our overview, varied considerably. The workplace setting, the exercise
671
regime and frequency, as well as the outcome measures were also het-
672
erogeneous across the various studies. This therefore limits the conclu-
673
sion that could be drawn in the present overview regarding exercise
674
interventions. Furthermore, not all exercise intervention may be appli-
675
cable to all participants and different occupational settings. High quality
676
randomized control trials that consider different exercise regimes incor-
677
porating varying duration, frequency, and intensity are therefore rec-
678
ommended for future studies.
679
Multidimensional strategies that involve more than one interven-
680
tion have been proposed to be effective in the prevention of LBP. The ra-
681
tionale for this approach lies in the multifactorial nature of the etiology
682
of LBP. However, our findings showed that exercise in combination with
683
education was the only multidimensional approach for which there was
684
dependable evidence that it was effective in the prevention of LBP. Bell
685
et al. (Bell & Burnett, 2009) reported that exercise in conjunction with
686
education was more effective in preventing episodes of LBP compared
687
with education alone in agreement with findings by Steffens et al.
688
(2016). None of the reviews that reported on this interventional strat-
689
egy compared the difference between the effectiveness of exercise and
690
education relative to exercise alone. Therefore, whether exercise com-
691
bined with education is more effective than exercise alone remains to
692
be determined by future research.
693
5. Conclusion
694
The main conclusions of the present overview are summarized in
695
Table 3 below.
696
6. General comments and limitations
697
In the present overview, an attempt was made to draw a clear dis-
698
tinction between primary and secondary prevention interventions.
699
However, this distinction was not always clear. For example, it is possi-
700
ble that reviews categorized as primary prevention in the present over-
701
view may have included participants with a history of LBP. This
702
limitation could be overcome by a more detailed description of the sub-
703
jects' characteristics in systematic reviews in LBP prevention.
704
As LBP prevalence increases with age, age should in future studies be
705
accounted for in an assessment of the effectiveness of a given interven-
706
tion (Hoy, Brooks, Blyth, & Buchbinder, 2010; Kent & Keating, 2005).
707
Lack of study subject adherence, as indicated in some studies
708
(Robison & Rogers, 1994), may be due to lack of motivation or incentive
709
of seemingly healthy and asymptomatic subjects to engage in preven-
710
tive interventions. Researchers, and employers, may therefore consider
711
providing additional incentives at the workplace to enhance participa-
712
tion in workplace interventions to prevent LBP.
713
Due to a high level of heterogeneity between studies regarding in-
714
tervention type, duration and frequency together with differences in
715
the baseline characteristics of subjects and in the workplace settings,
716
our synthesis of the research findings made use of a qualitative and de-
717
scriptive approach, meta-analysis across reviews was not deemed
718
feasible.
719
Since most of the included reviews reported on trials with short-
720
term follow-up, further, long-term studies are needed in the future.
721
Confounding factors among study subjects may have contributed to
722
the heterogeneity in the findings. For instance, lifestyle factors, genetic
723
make-up, and the load that may provoke back pain may vary consider-
724
ably among individual participants undergoing the same intervention.
725
These confounders may be difficult to control under experimental con-
726
ditions, but may still affect the conclusions of the systematic reviews
727
and ultimately our overview.
728
7. Practical application
729
The present overview provides moderate quality evidence that
730
exercise interventions are effective in the prevention of LBP and its
731
associated disability and workplace impact, at least in the short term.
732
Exercise programs in combination with education are more effective in
733
the prevention of LBP compared to education alone, lending support to
734
this multidimensional approach for the occupational prevention of LBP.
735
No precise conclusions can be drawn on the particular exercise
736
program that would be most effective in preventing LBP in workers in dif-
737
ferent occupational settings. Based on data from Bell and Burnett (2009),
738
exercise programs conducted for shorter durations (5 to 10 min) were
739
found to be beneficial.
740
Following the proven effectiveness of the exercise regimen in
741
question (this would require further research), employers could then
742
provide incentives to employees to facilitate implementation and
743
adherence to that exercise regimen. There is, however, the need for
744
high quality research on best-practice implementation approaches for
745
workplace programs and related exercise interventions that will fit
746
the context of a given workplace.
747
Researchers conducting primary research in the field should be en-
748
couraged to specify clearly defined and detailed criteria for including
749
participants in their studies. The interventions and the outcome mea-
750
sures should also be described in sufficient detail to enable comparison
751
between them. The studies conducted should include both short term
752
and long-term follow-up.
753
Systematic reviewers should explicitly state eligibility criteria and
754
ensure that the quality of each included study is assessed with validated
755
tools.
