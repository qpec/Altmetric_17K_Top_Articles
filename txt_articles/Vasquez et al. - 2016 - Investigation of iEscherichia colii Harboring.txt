On September 9, 2016, this report was posted as an MMWR 
Early Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr). 
The mcr-1 gene confers resistance to the polymyxins, 
including the antibiotic colistin, a medication of last resort 
for multidrug-resistant infections. The mcr-1 gene was first 
reported in 2015 in food, animal, and patient isolates from 
China (1) and is notable for being the first plasmid-mediated 
colistin resistance mechanism to be identified. Plasmids can 
be transferred between bacteria, potentially spreading the 
resistance gene to other bacterial species. Since its discovery, 
the mcr-1 gene has been reported from Africa, Asia, Europe, 
South America, and North America (2,3), including the United 
States, where it has been identified in Escherichia coli isolated 
from three patients and from two intestinal samples from pigs 
(2,4–6). In July 2016, the Pathogen Detection System at the 
National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, 
Maryland) identified mcr-1 in the whole genome sequence of 
an E. coli isolate from a Connecticut patient (7); this is the 
fourth isolate from a U.S. patient to contain the mcr-1 gene.
The isolate was non-Shiga toxin–producing E. coli O157 from 
stool collected on June 16, 2016 from a pediatric patient with 
diarrhea. The patient traveled to the Caribbean for approxi-
mately 2 weeks to visit friends and relatives and developed fever 
and bloody diarrhea on June 12, 2 days before returning to the 
United States. The patient took paromomycin, an aminoglycoside 
antibiotic, from symptom onset until a pediatric outpatient visit 
on June 16, at which time a stool specimen was collected. The 
patient was not hospitalized and, in addition to the primary care 
visit, had one brief emergency department visit during the illness.
E. coli O157 harboring mcr-1 was isolated from three stool 
cultures from the patient: the June 16 culture and follow-up 
cultures on June 18 and 23. Reference susceptibility test-
ing by broth microdilution showed that the isolates had a 
colistin (also known as polymyxin E) minimum inhibitory 
concentration (MIC) of 2 µg/ml, and polymyxin B MIC 
of 4 µg/ml. The isolates also carried a plasmid blacmy-2 gene, 
which encodes AmpC, an enzyme that confers resistance to 
third generation cephalosporins; the isolates were susceptible 
to carbapenems. Stool cultures on June 24 and July 1 were 
negative for E. coli O157.
The patient’s parent and health care provider were inter-
viewed to assess patient risk factors and close contacts who 
might be at risk for acquiring bacteria carrying mcr-1. The 
patient was typically healthy with no prior surgeries or hospi-
talizations. The patient’s usual diet included fruit, dairy prod-
ucts, and meat (pork, chicken, and beef). While traveling, the 
patient ate chicken and goat meat from a live animal market 
that the patient did not visit. The patient stayed in a home 
with a pet cat and dog in the Caribbean but did not have any 
animal contact in the United States.
Persons with close contact with the patient, particularly those 
involved in bathing or diapering, were considered to be at risk 
for mcr-1 acquisition. On July 19–20, perirectal swabs were 
obtained from all six identified household contacts; a perirectal 
swab and swab of a soiled diaper from the patient were collected 
approximately 24 hours apart. Bacteria with the mcr-1 gene were 
not detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction in any speci-
men, indicating that the patient and family members were not 
colonized with bacteria carrying mcr-1. Sixteen environmental 
samples collected from surfaces in the kitchen and diaper chang-
ing area of the patient’s home were negative for the presence of 
mcr-1. The patient did not have close contact with other persons 
after returning to the United States. Health care personnel had no 
direct contact with the patient’s body fluids and were not screened.
In this investigation of potentially travel-associated mcr-1 
acquisition, no transmission beyond the index patient or 
persistent environmental contamination were identified, and 
the patient was transiently colonized. At this time, CDC 
recommends that Enterobacteriaceae isolates with a colistin 
or polymyxin B MIC ≥4 µg/ml be tested for the presence of 
mcr-1; testing is available through CDC (5).* Prompt reporting 
of mcr-1–carrying isolates to public health officials allows for a 
rapid response to identify transmission and limit further spread.
