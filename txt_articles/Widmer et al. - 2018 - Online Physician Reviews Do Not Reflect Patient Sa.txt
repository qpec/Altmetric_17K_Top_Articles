Abstract
Online physician reviews have become increasingly prevalent and are a common means by which patients
explore medical options online. Currently, there are no data comparing physicians with negative online
reviews and those without negative reviews. We sought to compare industry-vetted patient satisfaction
surveys (PSSs), such as Press Ganey (PG) PSSs, between those physicians with negative online reviews and
those without negative reviews. Overall, there were 113 unique individuals with negative online reviews
from September 1, 2014, to December 31, 2014, with 8 being nonphysicians. We matched 113 physicians
in similar departments/divisions. We obtained PG PSS scores of both groups and compared the mean
scores of the 2 groups. Press Ganey PSS scores were available for 98 physicians with negative online
reviews compared with 82 matched physicians without negative online reviews. The mean raw PG PSS
scores were not different between the 2 groups (4.05; 95% CI, 3.99-4.11 vs 4.04; 95% CI, 3.97-4.11;
P¼.92). We also noted no difference in mean scores on questions related to physician-patient commu-
nication and interaction skills between those with poor online reviews and those without (4.38; 95% CI,
4.32-4.43 vs 4.41; 95% CI, 4.35-4.47; P¼.42). However, there was a significantly lower nonephysician-
specific mean in those with negative online reviews (3.91; 95% CI, 3.84-3.97) vs those without negative
online reviews (4.01; 95% CI, 3.95-4.09) (P¼.02). Here, we provide data indicating that online physician
reviews do not correlate to formal institutional PG PSS. Furthermore, physicians with negative online
reviews have lower scores on nonephysician-specific variables included in the PG PSSs, emphasizing that
these discrepancies can negatively affect overall patient experience, online physician reviews, and physi-
cian reputation. It is prudent that an improved mechanism for online ratings be implemented to better
inform patients about a physician’s online reputation.

O

physician
rating
sites
are
rapidly emerging, with 1 in 6 phy-
sicians being rated.1 These review
sites have been shown to affect patient atti-
tudes2 but have poor correlation with more
rigorous forms of patient satisfaction assess-
ments such as Press Ganey (PG) patient satis-
faction survey (PSS) in a single department.3
Furthermore, there appears to be no correla-
tion between online physician ratings and out-
comes such as coronary bypass mortality rates
among
cardiovascular
surgeons.4
The
apparent discrepancy in these physician evalu-
ations5,6 provides strong rationale for the
development of mechanisms for more accurate
online ratings for physicians and health care
organizations so as to better inform patients
who use social media platforms to guide
them in their health care experience.
Although up to 90% of these ratings are
positive, negative reviews can be particularly
challenging for physician reputation and on-
line
prestige
and
negatively
affect
the
physician-patient relationship.7 It is unclear
whether physicians with negative online re-
views have lower patient satisfaction scores
compared with a similarly matched cohort of
their working peers. What is not known is
whether negative online reviews are reflective
of physician communication and interactive
skills or of the entire patient experience and
journey at the medical center. These experi-
ences include interaction with desk staff,
nursing, physical environment, appointment

Here, we sought to compare the formal,
institution-collected, PG PSSs of a cohort of
physicians with negative open source online
reviews with those of a matched cohort of
physicians without negative online reviews to
discern any differences in PG PSS scores be-
tween the 2 groups; and to explore whether
any of these negative online reviews correlated
with physician-specific communication and
interaction variables.
METHODS
A pilot project developed from September 1,
2014, through December 31, 2014, estab-
lished the feasibility of using Google and Goo-
gle Alerts institution-wide using departmental
and divisional secretaries to track negative on-
line reviews of physicians at Mayo Clinic’s
campus in Rochester, Minnesota. Negative on-
line reviews were classified as any ratings
below 50% on a numerical scale, ratings below
“C” on a letter scale, and the comments asso-
ciated therein. An initial Google search in
September was combined with data collected
through December 2014. These negative re-
views were then collated and shared with pa-
tient experience leadership staff, the Mayo
Clinic Center for Social Media, and the depart-
mental/division chair to inform the physician
and provide counsel on managing the physi-
cian’s online reputation.
There were 113 unique individuals with
negative online reviews out of 2148 physicians
searched spanning 28 departments and divi-
sions (Table) during the same 4-month period
(from September through December 2014). A
separate
list
of
113
matched
physicians
without negative online reviews was randomly
generated by computer to provide an equal
number of physicians on a per department/di-
vision basis (Table) and verified, ensuring no
duplicates to serve as a comparative cohort.
The National Provider Identifier of this cohort
was used to pull PG PSS scores for each physi-
cian during that same time period. At the time,
these were labeled Avatar scores. Avatar was
acquired by PG in May 2016 and was subse-
quently labeled PG PSS.
Press Ganey PSS scores (on a scale of 0-5)
were obtained by the institution for each physi-
cian and divided into scores on physician-
specific and nonephysician-specific questions
(Supplemental
Table,
available
online
at
http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org).
We
compared the overall PG PSS mean score for
each physician in both those with negative on-
line reviews (n¼98) and those without nega-
tive online reviews (n¼82). We compared the
mean scores on the physician-specific ques-
tions and nonephysician-specific questions
for the entire cohort. We then analyzed
physician-specific vs nonephysician-specific
means in those who received negative online
reviews and those who did not. Finally, we

 compared the percentile ranks of physicians at
Mayo Clinic between the 2 groups.
For data analysis we transferred the down-
loaded raw metrics from Excel to JMP, a statis-
tical
software
package
(version
9.0,
SAS
Institute Inc). For continuous data, results
were summarized as means and 95% CIs.
Means � SDs were calculated and presented.
Two-sample t tests were used to compare
continuous
scores
between
groups;
chi-
square tests were used to compare categorical
results between groups. A conventional 2-
sided a level of .05 was used for all data to
determine statistical significance.
RESULTS
There were 141 total negative online reviews on
113 individuals. Sixteen of these individuals
had multiple (between 2 and 4) negative re-
views. Eight of the 113 individuals were non-
physicians
(nurse
practitioners,
physician
assistants, ophthalmology doctorates, or PhD
psychologists) and were not included in the
analysis (Supplemental Figure, available online
at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org). In
the combined cohort (113 individuals with
negative online reviews and 113 matched indi-
viduals), there were PG PSS scores for 98 physi-
cians with negative online reviews (86%; 28
departments/divisions) and for 82 of those in
the matched cohort of physicians without nega-
tive online reviews (73%; 28 departments/divi-
sions). The proportion of physicians having PG
PSSscoresavailable in the negative onlinegroup
(86%) was not different from that of physicians
who had PG PSS scores available in the matched
cohort (73%) (P¼.18). There was similar
representation from the 28 divisions/depart-
ments between the 2 groups (Table). There
was a mean of 1.2�0.4 reviews per physician
in the online analysis, with 22.9�15.9 reviews
per physician for the PG PSS scores.
The mean PG PSS scores (on a scale of 0-5)
were not significantly different between physi-
cians with negative online reviews (4.05; 95%
CI, 3.99-4.11) and those without negative on-
line
reviews
(4.04;
95%
CI,
3.97-4.11)
(P¼.92) (Figure 1, A). Furthermore, there
was no significant difference in percentile
ranks of PG PSS scores between the 2 groups
(negative online reviews: 84.8; 95% CI, 83.0-
86.6 vs no negative online reviews: 85.9;
95% CI, 83.9-87.9; P¼.40) (Figure 1, B).
In total, the physician-specific means were
significantly higher than the nonephysician-
specific means (4.41; 95% CI, 4.31-4.44 vs
3.91; 95% CI, 3.83-3.98; P<.0001). However,
there was no difference in physician-specific
means between physicians with negative online
reviews and those without negative online re-
views (4.38; 95% CI, 4.32-4.43 vs 4.41; 95%
CI, 4.35-4.47, P¼.42) (Figure 2, A). The mean
scores on the nonephysician-specific questions
were significantly lower among those with nega-
tive online reviews (3.91; 95% CI, 3.84-3.97) vs
those without negative online reviews (4.01;
95% CI, 3.95-4.09) (P¼.02) (Figure 2, B).
In a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the pos-
sibility of underestimating negative PG PSS
scores, we also evaluated whether physicians
had received any overall PG PSS score less
than 3 on at least 1 visit during the time frame.

tive PG PSS score

POOR CORRELATION OF ONLINE PHYSICIAN REVIEWS

 physicians with negative online reviews (43%)
and physicians without negative online re-
views (55%) (chi-square, P¼.11).
DISCUSSION
In this work, we describe the novel findings
that negative online physician reviews do not
equate to similarly negative formal institu-
tional
PG
PSS
scores,
especially
when
compared to a matched cohort who does not
have
a
negative
online
presence.
These
findings are important, not only in disassociat-
ing formal PG PSS scores from online review
comments but also in emphasizing that physi-
cians need to be cognizant of their reputation
both online and in-person.
These data reveal no statistical difference in
formal PG PSS scores between those physicians
who have negative online reviews and those
who do not. More importantly, there is a stark
chasm between patient perception of the
physician-related
performance
and
none
physician-specific variables. More specifically,
the adverse component of the negative online
reviews is not necessarily related to physician-
specific interactions with the patient, but rather
to the nonephysician-related complaints. In
fact, physicians with negative online reviews
had significantly lower nonephysician-related
scores than did those without negative online
reviews (P¼.2).
Although these data cannot tease apart
what particular instance or patient experience
drove the negative online review, it is prudent
that physicians pay careful attention to their
“in-person” as well as “online” presence to
maintain their true reputation.
Previous work has shown a distinction be-
tween these online physician reviews and
certain metrics such as outcomes4 and other
more rigorous forms of PSSs.5,6 With respect
to these online physician reviews, the sample
size is often small and the reviews may be
biased, potentially creating an inaccurate and
unfair
reflection
on
a
physiciandoften
without the physician being aware.3 Further-
more, these online physician reviews are un-
structured and not systematically designed to
thoroughly
review
the
physiciandpatient
interaction on the entire patient experience
and journey. These reviews likely provide a
consumer or patient searching online for
health care services an incomplete depiction
of the physician’s reputation and his or her
true commitment to and expertise in patient
care.
Despite the lack of rigor and potential for
harm to the physician’s, and potentially the insti-
tution’s, reputation from online reviews, institu-
tions and physicians are slow to display more
scores and ratings online. Perhaps the time has
come for improved mechanisms to support
health care organizations and their physicians
to allow a more qualified and verified form of
PSS scores to be included online in an attempt
to overcome often single and unsubstantiated
online reviews by open source online websites.
Institutions could allow patients access to vetted
physician-specific PSS scores and reviews. The
identification of negative reviews could then be
used to assist physicians with areas for improve-
ment. The institution could subsequently high-
light the more positive attributes or experiences
of those physicians with low scores along with

 appropriate feedback and resources to improve
their communication and interactive skills.
Physicians
could
then
use
the
formal,
institution-vetted, PSS scores to build and
manage their online reputation, which in this
day and age is crucial for public perception. Phy-
sicians could also take this opportunity to use
social media to underscore these formal PSS re-
views, counteract negative open source reviews,
and help ensure a positive online presence.
Furthermore, physicians and their institutions
in a more appropriate setting can proactively
manage any negative formal patient reviews
and prevent having physicians’ reputation nega-
tively affected across the World Wide Web.
Certainly, these issues and conversations need
to occur for physicians to advance and present
their best image and most accurate reflection of
their reputation to the public.8
As with all retrospective studies, this study
does have some limitations. For example,
comparing groups with such small numbers
can result in physicians with different practices
affecting the comparison by chance. Further-
more, in an effort to remove selection bias in
our cohort, the a priori delineation of physi-
cians within departments/divisions with and
without negative online reviews may not have
created equivalent cohorts. Although we could
have created, in a post hoc fashion, a numeri-
cally matched cohort, this would have compro-
mised
the
randomly
computer-generated
matched cohort. Thus, we elected to continue
with a dissimilar numerical cohort. Further-
more, this study includes only a limited time
period for data collection using a single nonva-
lidated search engine and certainly a study with
longer follow-up should be undertaken in a
confirmatory manner. Finally, it should be
noted that these subjective reviews and ratings
reflect single experiences of patients and do
not reflect on the overall aptitude or clinical
competence of the physician. Although these
online ratings are increasing, it is important to
better understand the processes by which these
ratings are determined to provide some inter-
pretation to physicians to help improve their
practice and patient care experience.
CONCLUSION
We find no difference in formal institutional
PG PSS scores between physicians who have
negative online reviews and those who do
not.
Furthermore,
nonephysician-specific
variables appear to reflect unfairly on physi-
cians with negative online reviews. These
data underscore the importance of health
care organizations and their physicians to be
aware of patient experience content posted
on social media platforms and be proactive
in managing their online reputation.
