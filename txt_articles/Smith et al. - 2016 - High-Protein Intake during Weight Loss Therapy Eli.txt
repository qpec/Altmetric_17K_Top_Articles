In Brief
Smith et al. found that high-protein intake
during weight loss (WL) preserves lean
tissue mass but eliminates the WL-
induced improvement in muscle insulin
action. The authors suggest that this
occurs through increasing oxidative
stress and modulating WL-induced
changes in cell structure and
organization.

SUMMARY
High-protein (HP) intake during weight loss (WL)
therapy is often recommended because it reduces
the loss of lean tissue mass. However, HP intake
could have adverse effects on metabolic function,
because protein ingestion reduces postprandial in-
sulin sensitivity. In this study, we compared the ef-
fects of �10% WL with a hypocaloric diet containing
0.8 g protein/kg/day and a hypocaloric diet contain-
ing 1.2 g protein/kg/day on muscle insulin action
in postmenopausal women with obesity. We found
that HP intake reduced the WL-induced decline in
lean tissue mass by �45%. However, HP intake
also prevented the WL-induced improvements in
muscle
insulin
signaling
and
insulin-stimulated
glucose uptake, as well as the WL-induced adapta-
tions in oxidative stress and cell structural biology
pathways. Our data demonstrate that the protein
content of a WL diet can have profound effects on
metabolic function and underscore the importance
of considering dietary macronutrient composition
during WL therapy for people with obesity.
INTRODUCTION
Insulin-resistant glucose metabolism is the most common meta-
bolic complication associated with obesity and a key risk factor
for developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary heart disease
(Kirk and Klein, 2009). Weight loss (WL) induced by dietary
energy restriction is the cornerstone of therapy for people
who are obese, because it improves or even normalizes insulin
sensitivity and related comorbidities (Klein, 2001). However,
diet-induced weight loss also decreases lean tissue (including
muscle) mass (Wycherley et al., 2012; Leidy et al., 2015), which
could have adverse effects on physical function, particularly in
populations who are at increased risk of sarcopenia, such as
postmenopausal women (Samson et al., 2000; Phillips et al.,
1993). Although increased protein intake during diet-induced
weight loss is often recommended, because it helps preserve
lean tissue mass (Wycherley et al., 2012; Leidy et al., 2015),
data from a series of studies suggest that high protein (HP) intake
could have detrimental metabolic effects; acute intravenous
amino acid infusion or protein ingestion reduces insulin sensi-
tivity (Smith et al., 2015; Krebs et al., 2002; Robinson et al.,
2014), and habitual HP intake is associated with insulin resis-
tance and an increased risk of developing T2D (Linn et al.,
1996; Sluijs et al., 2010; Tinker et al., 2011). The effect of
increased protein intake per se on weight-loss-induced changes
in insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis are not known
because of the confounding effects of differences in weight
loss and food selection and overall diet composition (e.g., con-
sumption of dairy and meat products and saturated and unsatu-
rated fatty acids) between groups in studies that compared HP
diets with standard protein diets (Rietman et al., 2014; Wycherley
et al., 2012; Schwingshackl and Hoffmann, 2013).
The major purpose of the present study was to conduct a ran-
domized, controlled trial (RCT) to determine whether increasing
protein intake as part of a macronutrient-balanced, hypocaloric
diet attenuates both the weight loss-induced reduction in lean
tissue mass and the beneficial effect of a targeted 8%–10%
weight loss on insulin action. Postmenopausal women with
obesity were randomized to one of three interventions: (1) a
WL group who consumed a hypocaloric diet containing 0.8 g
protein/kg body weight per day, (2) a WL-HP diet group who
consumed a hypocaloric diet containing 1.2 g protein/kg body
weight per day, and (3) a weight-maintenance (WM) control
group. Subjects in the WL and WL-HP groups were studied
before and after they lost 8%–10% of their initial body weight
and were weight stable (<2% change in body weight) for
3–4 weeks, whereas subjects in the WM group were studied after
a time-matched (�6 months) weight maintenance period. Insulin
sensitivity was assessed by using the hyperinsulinemic-euglyce-
mic clamp procedure (HECP) in conjunction with stable-isotope-
labeled glucose tracer infusion and by evaluating muscle AKT
phosphorylation. The rate of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake
(glucose rate of disappearance [Rd] during the HECP) was the
primary outcome. In addition, we evaluated the muscle global
transcriptome and a series of factors that can influence insulin
action, including: (1) the concentrations of amino acids and their

 the prescribed amounts of 0.8 g per kg body weight per day in
the WL group and 1.2 g per kg body weight per day in the WL-
HP group; urinary nitrogen excretion rate was �50% greater
(p < 0.01) in the WL-HP group than the WL group (Table 1).
The contribution of carbohydrates (or CHO) and fat to total en-
ergy intake was only minimally different (<6%) in the two weight
loss groups, and the contribution of carbohydrates and fat to
non-protein energy intake was the same (Table 1).
Changes in Body Weight and Composition
Body weight and body composition in the WM group did not
change during the intervention. Both the WL and WL-HP groups
lost �10% of their initial body weight, but the contribution of fat-
free mass (FFM) to total weight loss was �45% less in the WL-
HP group than in the WL group (p = 0.03) (Figure 1). However,
the absolute loss of FFM was small, so that only �700 g of
FFM were preserved in the WL-HP compared with the WL group.
Intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content and intra-abdominal ad-
ipose tissue (IAAT) volume did not change in the WM group but
decreased by �45% (IHTG) and �20% (IAAT), respectively, in
both the WL and WL-HP groups (p < 0.01 versus the WM group;
there was no difference between the WL and WL-HP groups)
(Figure 1).

Plasma Hormone and Metabolite
Concentrations
Basal insulin concentration was the same
before and after the intervention in the
WM group and decreased to the same
extent (�30%) after weight loss in the WL
and WL-HP groups (p < 0.05 versus the
WM group; no difference between the
WL and WL-HP groups) (Table 2). Glucose
and insulin concentrations achieved during
the HECP after the intervention were not
different from those achieved before the
intervention in all three groups (Table 2).
Basal FFA concentration did not change
in the WM group and decreased to the
same extent (�15%) after weight loss in the WL and WL-HP
groups. During the HECP, FFA concentration decreased by
�90%, both before and after the interventions, in all three groups
(Table 2). Basal branched-chain amino acid concentration was
�8% lower (p < 0.05) after weight loss in both the WL and
WL-HP groups (no difference between groups), whereas basal
total essential (including branched-chain) and non-essential
amino acid concentrations were not affected by weight loss in
either the WL group or the WL-HP group. During the HECP, the
sum of all (total) and non-essential amino acid concentrations
decreased to the same extent in all three groups before and after
the intervention. In contrast, the HECP-induced decreases in
branched-chain and total essential (including branched-chain)
amino acid concentrations were �15% greater (p < 0.05) after
than before weight loss in both the WL and WL-HP groups
(Table 2; Figure S1). Plasma C3 and C5 acylcarnitine concentra-
tions did not change in the WM group and tended to decrease by
�15% (p = 0.11) after weight loss in both the WL and WL-HP
groups (no difference between groups) (Table 2). FGF21 concen-
trations were not different between groups at baseline and
decreased by �25% in both the WL and WL-HP groups (p <
0.05 versus the WM group; no difference between the WL and
WL-HP groups) but did not change in the WM group (Table 2).

 Glucose Kinetics
Basal glucose Ra and glucose Rd during the HECP in the WM
group did not change during the intervention (Table 2). Basal
glucose Ra decreased by �6% after weight loss in both the
WL and WL-HP groups (p < 0.05 versus the WM group; no differ-
ence between the WL and WL-HP groups) (Table 2). Glucose Ra
during the HECP was almost completely (by 85% ± 2%) sup-
pressed in all studies, both before and after weight loss (main
effect of clamp, p < 0.001; no significant interactions and no sig-
nificant main effects of either group or time) (Table 2). Glucose
Rd during the HECP increased by 25.3% ± 6.5% (p < 0.01) after
weight loss in the WL group, whereas glucose Rd during the
HECP after weight loss was not different from before weight
loss in the WL-HP group (Figure 1).
By chance, baseline mean glucose Rd during the clamp pro-
cedure was 12% higher in the WL-HP group than in the WL and
WM groups. This difference was largely driven by one person
whose baseline glucose Rd was 5,528 mmol/min (nearly double

was 2,693 ± 158 mmol/min and nearly identical to the average
glucose Rd values in the other two groups (2,741 ± 537 and
2,649 ± 214 mmol/min in the WM and WL groups, respectively).
Excluding this subject from the statistical analysis does not
affect the results (i.e., HP intake eliminates the weight-loss-
induced improvement in insulin-mediated glucose Rd, regard-
less of whether this person is or is not included in the analysis).

not ACADM) in muscle did not change with weight loss in either
the WL group or the WL-HP group (Figure 3). Muscle gene
expression of SCD (stearoyl-coenzyme A [CoA] desaturase)
and ACADM [acyl-CoA dehydrogenase] was lower after than
before weight loss in both the WL and WL-HP groups (Figure 3).

Microarray Technique
Twenty-six gene sets were similarly affected by weight loss in
the WL and WL-HP groups, and 34 were differently affected by
WL in the WL and WL-HP groups (Tables 3, S1, and S2). Of
those, several that were related to cell structure and organization
were upregulated in the WL group and not affected, or even
downregulated, by weight loss in the WL-HP group. A pathway
related to the regulation of signal transduction was upregulated,
and an oxidative stress gene set pathway was downregulated in
the WL group but not in the WL-HP group.
DISCUSSION
Although many studies have evaluated the effect of HP diets on
metabolic function, the results from several systematic reviews
and meta-analyses indicate that it is not possible to determine
the effect of HP intake, per se, on insulin sensitivity because
of differences in overall diet composition (food selection and
nutrient composition) and amount of weight loss between
the HP-intervention and control groups (Rietman et al., 2014;
Wycherley et al., 2012; Schwingshackl and Hoffmann, 2013).
Therefore, we conducted an RCT to evaluate the effect of dietary
protein intake on body composition and insulin sensitivity by
providing a protein supplement to subjects during weight loss
to minimize the potential confounding influences of differences
in overall diet composition on our outcome measures. In addi-
tion, participants who were given a standard-protein hypocaloric
diet (0.8 g protein/kg per day) and those given a HP hypocaloric
diet (1.2 g protein/kg per day) were assessed before and after
matched (�10%) weight loss. We found that the WL-HP diet
blunted the weight loss-induced decline in FFM by �45%. How-
ever, the clinical importance of this effect is unclear, because it
represents a very small difference in loss of FFM between groups
(�700 g or 1.5% of total FFM). The beneficial effect of 10%
weight loss on muscle insulin action (assessed as glucose
disposal rate and phosphorylation of AKT in muscle during an
HECP) was eliminated by HP intake. The failure to improve

 muscle insulin sensitivity in the WL-HP group is clinically impor-
tant because it reflects a failure to improve a major pathophysi-
ological mechanism involved in the development of T2D (Groop,
1999; Petersen and Shulman, 2002) and indicates that more in-

loss diet can have profound effects on
metabolic function and underscore the
importance of considering dietary macro-
nutrient composition in conjunction with
energy content itself in weight loss therapy
for people with obesity.
The mechanism(s) responsible for the
adverse effect of HP intake on insulin
action are unclear. Failure to improve in-
sulin-stimulated glucose uptake in the
WL-HP
group
compared
to
the
WL
group occurred in the absence of any
major differences in body weight, body
composition, plasma FFA availability, and
inflammatory markers in plasma or muscle
in the two groups. Data from studies
conducted in cultured myotubes, isolated
rat skeletal muscles, and transgenic mice
have demonstrated that amino acids—
particularly
the
branched-chain
amino
acid
leucine—can
impair
insulin-medi-
ated glucose uptake by AMPK-mediated
mTOR phosphorylation and subsequent
negative feedback inhibition of phosphati-
dylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling
(Iwanaka et al., 2010; Saha et al., 2011) or
possibly downstream signaling to 4E-BP1
(Tsai et al., 2015). In contrast, we recently
found
that
these
pathways
were
not
involved in the inhibition of insulin-mediated glucose uptake
that occurred with acute protein ingestion in people (Smith
et al., 2015). In the present study, we also found that chronic
HP intake impaired the weight loss-induced improvement in in-
sulin-mediated glucose uptake in the absence of differences in
p-AMPKThr172, p-mTORSer2448, and p-4E-BP1Thr37/46 in muscle.
Data from several recent studies have implicated other amino

 acids (e.g., glycine and tryptophan) and the amino acid metabo-
lites C3- and C5-acylcarnitine in the development of insulin resis-
tance as well (e.g., Schooneman et al., 2013; Hattersley et al.,
2014), but we found no differences in the plasma amino acid pro-
file between the WL and WL-HP groups. Weight loss reduced
basal plasma branched-chain amino acid concentrations and
tended to decrease the plasma concentrations of the amino
acid metabolites C3- and C5-acylcarnitine in both the WL and
WL-HP groups without a difference between groups; the decline
in both branched-chain and total essential (including branched-
chain) amino acid concentrations during the HECP was also
greater after than before weight loss in both the WL and WL-
HP groups without a difference between groups. These findings
suggest that the adverse effect of HP intake on insulin action dur-
ing weight loss was not due to differences in circulating amino
acids or their metabolites.
It is also unlikely that the adverse effects of HP intake on insulin
action were mediated by FGF21, which has been shown to in-
crease insulin sensitivity in rodent models (Camporez et al.,
2013; Mashili et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2009; Markan et al., 2014).
Although plasma FGF21 concentration increases after severe
protein (Laeger et al., 2014) and calorie restriction (Ga
¨ lman
et al., 2008; Fazeli et al., 2015), we found that moderate weight
loss decreased basal FGF21 concentration and had no effect
on plasma FGF21 concentration during the HECP in both the
WL and WL-HP groups.
An imbalance in cellular redox status is considered a key
mechanism for the development of muscle insulin resistance
in persons with obesity (Muoio and Neufer, 2012; Anderson
et al., 2009). Our microarray analysis results suggest that oxida-
tive-stress-related metabolic processes in muscle decreased
after weight loss in the WL group, but not the WL-HP group,
and weight loss in the WL group, but not the WL-HP group,
also decreased the gene expression of GSTA4. GSTA4 is a
member of the glutathione S-transferase family, and its expres-
sion is a marker of oxidative stress burden (Frohnert et al.,
2014; Raza et al., 2002). Weight loss in the WL-HP group, on
the other hand, increased the gene expression of PRDX3 in
muscle. PRDX3 is a member of the peroxiredoxin family of an-
tioxidants within mitochondria, and experimentally induced
oxidative stress in animal models increases PRDX3 tissue
expression (Schro
¨ der et al., 2008); in people, gene expression
of PRDX3 is also increased in conditions that are associated
with oxidative stress, such as cancer (Whitaker et al., 2013;
Kim et al., 2009). These results suggest that the adverse effect
of HP intake on insulin action during weight loss therapy may
have been mediated through its effects on oxidative stress
because it prevented the WL-induced decrease, and even
increased, metabolic pathways involved in oxidative stress
response in muscle.
Our microarray analysis also identified a series of gene set
pathways related to intracellular and extracellular structure and
organization that were upregulated by weight loss in the WL
group but not changed, or even decreased, in the WL-HP group.
The intracellular cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix of muscle
cells are important in regulating muscle insulin action by
providing a scaffold that serves as a binding site for signaling
molecules and for transporting GLUT4 from intracellular vesicles
to the plasma membrane (Liu et al., 2013; Klip et al., 2014; Asrih
et al., 2011; Bose et al., 2002; Zaid et al., 2008; Brozinick et al.,
2007; Chen et al., 2007). Our data, therefore, suggest that adap-
tations in pathways related to tissue structural biology are
involved in the weight loss-induced improvement in muscle insu-
lin action, which were prevented by HP intake.

Cell Reports 17, 849–861, October 11, 2016
 Although we found that HP intake during weight loss attenu-
ates the beneficial effect of moderate weight loss on muscle
insulin action, this does not mean that an HP weight loss diet
necessarily results in a diminished improvement in plasma
glucose homeostasis. 24-hr glycemic control is determined by
both postabsorptive and postprandial plasma glucose concen-
trations, which are determined by glucose Ra into plasma
(from endogenous and exogenous/dietary sources) and glucose
Rd from plasma. Both endogenous glucose Ra and glucose Rd
are regulated by insulin, and the metabolic response to insulin
across the range of physiological concentrations (basal, postab-
sorptive to peak postprandial) differs among organs. Endoge-
nous (mostly hepatic) glucose production is much more sensitive
to insulin than is muscle glucose uptake and is nearly completely
suppressed at plasma insulin concentrations that only minimally
stimulate muscle glucose uptake (Conte et al., 2012). The decline
in basal plasma insulin concentration after weight loss without a
change in plasma glucose concentration and a slight reduction in
basal glucose Ra, suggests that weight loss in both the WL and
WL-HP groups may have improved hepatic insulin sensitivity. On
the other hand, our use of the HECP, in conjunction with stable
isotopically labeled glucose tracer infusion and an insulin infu-
sion rate that results in systemic plasma insulin concentrations
within the postprandial range, allowed us to measure muscle
insulin sensitivity, and our data demonstrate that HP intake
prevented the WL-induced improvement in muscle insulin sensi-
tivity. Dietary protein is a potent insulin secretagogue (Floyd
et al., 1966; Ang et al., 2012; Manders et al., 2014), which may
overcome the adverse effect of protein on insulin sensitivity by
increasing the secretion of insulin. In addition, protein causes
greater satiation and has a greater thermogenic effect of feeding
than carbohydrate and fat, which can lead to greater weight loss
with an HP than a standard protein diet (Wycherley et al., 2012;
Leidy et al., 2015). Therefore, the adverse effect of dietary protein
on muscle insulin action could be offset by its effect on hepatic
insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and energy balance.
In summary, the results from our study demonstrate that HP
intake during weight loss helps preserve FFM but eliminates
the beneficial effect of weight loss on skeletal muscle insulin ac-
tion. The mechanisms responsible for the adverse effect of HP
intake on muscle insulin action are not clear. Our data suggest
that HP intake causes alterations in muscle cell structure
and organization and oxidative stress, which are involved in pre-
venting the therapeutic effect of weight loss on muscle insulin
action, whereas changes in circulating amino acids, including
branched-chain amino acids and their metabolites, plasma
FGF21 concentration, muscle mTOR signaling, and inflamma-
tory pathways in muscle, are not involved.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Subjects and Study Design
Thirty-four sedentary (< 1.5 hr exercise per week) and weight-stable (< 2 kg
change
for
at
least
6
months),
50-
to
65-year-old
postmenopausal
women with obesity were included in this study (ClinicalTrials.gov number
NCT01538836), which was approved by the Human Research Protection Of-
fice at the Washington University School of Medicine. Written informed con-
sent was obtained from all subjects before their participation in the study.
We specifically chose to study only postmenopausal women with obesity
because we wanted to study a population for whom weight loss with increased
protein intake is often recommended to reduce the risk of sarcopenia (Houston
et al., 2009; Wolfe et al., 2008).
The flow of study subjects is shown in Figure S4. All subjects were evaluated
by a history and physical examination, a resting 12-lead electrocardiogram,
standard blood tests, and an oral glucose tolerance test. None of the subjects
had evidence of chronic illness or significant organ dysfunction (e.g., diabetes
mellitus, liver cirrhosis) or were taking medications (including hormone
replacement therapy) that could affect insulin or glucose metabolism, and
none consumed tobacco products, reported regular consumption of >115 g
of alcohol per week, or scored >2 points (out of a possible 22) on the Michigan
Alcohol Screening Test.
After subjects completed body composition analyses and an HECP, they
were randomized to one of three intervention groups: (1) a WM group; (2) a
WL group, who consumed an energy-reduced diet containing 0.8 g protein/kg
body weight per day; and (3) a WL-HP group, who consumed an energy-
reduced diet containing 1.2 g protein/kg body weight per day. All outcomes
were evaluated before and after subjects randomized to the weight loss
groups lost 8%–10% of their body weight or a time-matched weight mainte-
nance period for those randomized to the WM group. Twenty-seven subjects
completed the study and were included in the analysis; their characteristics are
shown in Table 1. The baseline characteristics of the seven subjects who drop-
ped out of the study (Figure S4) were not different from those who completed
the study (data not shown).
Outcomes Assessment
Body Composition
Fat mass and FFM were determined by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiom-
etry (DXA; Lunar iDXA, GE Healthcare Lunar), and IAAT volume and IHTG
content were determined by using MRI/spectroscopy (1.5-T superconducting
magnet; Siemens), as previously described (Frimel et al., 2007; Magkos et al.,
2007).
Insulin Action—HECP
Subjects were instructed to refrain from vigorous physical activities for 3 days
before being admitted to the Clinical Research Unit, where they consumed a
standard 800 kcal dinner (50% carbohydrate [or CHO], 30% fat, 20% protein)
between 1800 hr and 1900 hr. In addition, all subjects consumed a 100-kcal
liquid meal supplement (Ensure, Abbott Laboratories, containing 15% of en-
ergy as protein, 55% as carbohydrate, and 30% as fat) at baseline (before the
dietary intervention); after the intervention, subjects in the WM and WL groups
consumed the same liquid meal supplement, and subjects in the WL-HP
group consumed a 100-kcal whey protein solution (Unjury, ProSynthesis Lab-
oratories) containing 21 g protein. Subjects then fasted, except for water, until
the next morning. At 0600 hr, catheters were inserted into an arm vein for the
infusion of stable-isotope-labeled tracers, and later insulin and dextrose, and
into a radial artery for blood sampling. At �0645 hr, a constant infusion of
[U-13C16]palmitate (infusion rate: 6 nmol 3 kg body weight�1 3 min�1) and
a primed, constant infusion of [6,6-2H2]glucose (priming dose: 22 mmol 3
kg body weight�1; infusion rate: 0.22 mmol 3 kg body weight�1 3 min�1),
both purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, were started and
maintained for 4 hr. Upon completion of the basal period, an HECP was initi-
ated with two 5-min priming doses (first 200 mU 3 m�2 body surface area
[BSA] 3 min�1, then 100 mU 3 m�2 BSA 3 min�1) of human insulin (Novolin
R, Novo Nordisk), followed by constant infusion of insulin at a rate of 50 mU 3
m�2 BSA 3 min�1. Euglycemia (at a blood glucose concentration of
�100 mg/dL) was maintained by variable rate infusion of 20% dextrose
(Baxter) enriched to 2.5% with [6,6-2H2]glucose. Blood samples to determine
plasma metabolite and hormone concentrations as well as glucose and
palmitate kinetics were obtained immediately before starting the tracer infu-
sions and every 6–7 min during the last 20 min of the basal period and the
HECP; additional blood samples were obtained every 10 min during the
HECP to monitor blood glucose concentration. Muscle tissue from the quad-
riceps femoris was obtained by using a Tilley-Henkel forceps 60 min after
starting the glucose tracer infusion (basal period) and 180 min after starting
the insulin infusion. The basal and HECP biopsies were taken through
separate incisions (�5 cm apart) from the right leg before and after the
intervention.

 Blood and Tissue Sample Processing and Analyses
Plasma glucose concentration was determined by using an automated
glucose analyzer (Yellow Spring Instruments). ELISAs were used to determine
insulin (EMD Millipore), C-reactive protein, IL6, and FGF21 (all from R&D Sys-
tems) concentrations. Plasma amino acid concentrations were determined by
using the EZfaast physiological (free) amino acid kit (Phenomenex) and gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS; Hewlett-Packard MSD 5973
system with capillary column) analysis per manufacturer instructions. Total
plasma FFA concentration was quantified by using an enzymatic colorimetric
assay (Wako Diagnostics). Plasma glucose and palmitate tracer-to-tracee ra-
tios (TTRs) were determined by using GC-MS as previously described (Smith
et al., 2015; Mittendorfer et al., 2003b). C3- and C5-acylcarnitine concentra-
tions in plasma were quantified by using liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS; Applied Biosystems Sciex 4000QTRAP
with Eclipse C18 column) after adding known amounts of propionyl-L-carnitine
(N-trimethyl-d3) and isovaleryl-L-carnitine (N,N,N-trimethyl-d9) (both pur-
chased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as internal standards and their
conversion to methylesters as described (with minor modifications) by Forni
et al. (2010).
Western blot analysis was used to quantify the contents of p-AKTSer473,
p-mTORSer2448, p-4E-BP1Thr37/46, and p-AMPKThr172 in muscle. Frozen mus-
cle tissue was homogenized in ice-cold cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Tech-
nology), and proteins were extracted as previously described (Yoshino et al.,
2012). Thirty micrograms of protein from each sample were loaded onto poly-
acrylamide gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories), separated by SDS-PAGE, and trans-
ferred to Immun-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The
blotted membranes were incubated with the following primary antibodies
(all from Cell Signaling Technology, except for TUBULIN, which was pur-
chased from Sigma-Aldrich): rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473)
and anti-total-AKT; rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-mTOR (Ser2448) and
anti-total-mTOR; rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr37/46) and
anti-total-4E-BP1; rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-AMPKa (Thr172); rabbit
polyclonal anti-total-AMPKa; and mouse monoclonal anti-a-TUBULIN. All
(except for TUBULIN) blots were incubated with a horseradish-peroxidase-
conjugated
secondary
antibody
from
Cell
Signaling
Technology;
the
a-TUBULIN blot was incubated with a horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Blots were developed
by using the Amersham ECL Select Western Blotting Detection Reagent
(GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The contents of p-AKTSer473, p-mTORSer2448,
p-4E-BP1Thr37/46, and p-AMPKThr172 were expressed relative to a single
sample loading control and relative to total AKT, mTOR, 4E-BP1, AMPK, or
TUBULIN (p-AKTSer473 only). The results were the same, regardless of the
control protein used.
The expression of genes involved in inflammatory (CD68, IL6, MCP1, and
TNF), oxidative stress defense (CAT, GSTA4, SOD1, and PRDX3), lipogenic
(CHREBP, ELOVL6, FADS1, FASN, SCD, and SREBF1), and fatty acid
oxidation and mitochondrial function (ACADM, COX4/1, CPT1B, PDK4,
PPARGC1A, and UCP2) pathways in muscle were analyzed by using the
real-time PCR technique after total RNA was isolated from frozen muscle sam-
ples by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), quantified spectrophotometrically
(NanoDrop 1000, Thermo Scientific), and reverse transcribed (High-Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit, Invitrogen). Gene expression was determined
by using an ABI 7500 RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) and SYBR Green Master Mix
(Invitrogen) as previously described (Smith et al., 2014; Yoshino et al., 2014).
The expression of each gene was determined by normalizing the cycle
threshold value of each sample to the housekeeping control gene, ribosomal
protein RPLP0. Primer details are listed in Table S3.
Microarray analyses were performed with the GeneChip Human Gene 1.0
ST Array (Affymetrix), and pathways that were significantly altered by the
dietary interventions were identified by using the R statistical software pack-
age and parametric analysis of gene set enrichment (PAGE), as previously
described (Fabbrini et al., 2015; Yoshino et al., 2011; Kim and Volsky, 2005).
Gene sets used in PAGE were obtained from http://www.broadinstitute.org/
gsea/msigdb/msigdb_index.html (C5: GO [Gene Ontology] gene sets collec-
tion). Z scores and p values were calculated for each gene set. Microarray
results were deposited in the NCBI GEO database (accession number GEO:
GSE73525).
Glucose and Palmitate Kinetics Calculations
The Ra of unlabeled glucose in plasma, which represents the endogenous
glucose production rate during basal conditions, was calculated by dividing
the glucose tracer infusion rate by the average plasma glucose TTR
during the last 20 min of the basal period and the last 20 min of the HECP.
During the HECP, total glucose Ra, which equals glucose Rd from plasma,
was calculated as the sum of endogenous glucose production plus the rate
of infused glucose (dextrose plus tracer). Palmitate Ra in plasma was calcu-
lated by dividing the tracer infusion rate by the average plasma palmitate
TTR during the last 20 min of the basal period.
Diet Intervention
Subjects attended weekly sessions led by an experienced weight management
dietician to ensure compliance with the diet prescription, monitor body weight,
and counsel subjects throughout the dietary intervention. The energy content of
the initial packed meals given to the weight loss groups was targeted to provide
30% fewer calories than each person’s estimated total daily energy expendi-
ture, based on their resting metabolic rate (RMR) multiplied by an activity factor
of 1.4 (Black et al., 1996); subsequent meals and dietary intake were adjusted
weekly as needed to achieve a 0.5%–1% weight loss per week until 8%–10%
was achieved.Once the targeted weight loss goal was achieved, dietary energy
intake was modified to maintain a stable body weight for 3–4 weeks before the
testing procedures performed at baseline were repeated. Protein intake and
macronutrient distribution of the diet were kept constant in accordance with
the initial diet prescription throughout the intervention period. In the WM group,
each subject’s energy intake was adjusted as needed to maintain body weight
within 2% of the initial body weight. Target protein intake for the WL group was
0.8 g protein/kg body weight per day and 1.2 g protein/kg body weight per day
for subjects in the WL-HP group.
All subjects were provided with a base diet of frozen entrees (eLiving meals,
Morrison Healthcare; Lean Cuisine, Nestle
´ USA; Revel Kitchen) for lunch and
dinner. For breakfast, subjects consumed two energy bars (NuGo Nutrition)
per day. Subjects in the WL-HP diet group also consumed two servings of a
whey protein isolate (Unjury, ProSynthesis Laboratories) per day, whereas sub-
jectsintheWLgroupconsumedsnacksthat providedmostlycarbohydratesand
fat (in proportion to their contribution to total non-protein dietary energy content
of the base diet; i.e., �63 and 37%, respectively) instead. Additional calories
needed to meet each subject’s total energy and macronutrient requirements
were consumed as fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and starches. Dietary
compliance was monitored by having subjects record their dietary intake every
day by using the https://www.myfitnesspal.com computer app; the study dieti-
cian reviewed diet records weekly. In addition,24-hrurinaryurea nitrogen excre-
tion was evaluated before and during the final week of the dietary intervention.
Statistical Analyses
All datasets were tested for normality by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
One-way ANOVA was used to compare basic characteristics of the study sub-
jects, their macronutrient intake, and baseline metabolic characteristics in each
of the three groups. Analysis of covariance with the baseline value as covariate
was used to evaluate the effect of the dietary interventions on study outcomes
that were measured during basal or HECP conditions only. An ANOVA with
group (WL versus WL-HP), condition (basal versus clamp), and time (pre- versus
post-intervention) as factors, as appropriate, was used to evaluate the effects of
dietary interventions on outcomes that were measured during basal conditions
and during the HECP; and significant interactions were followed by Tukey’s post
hoc procedure to locate significant mean differences. A p value % 0.05 was
considered statistically significantforalldata,exceptourmicroarraydata. Treat-
ment-induced changes in gene set pathway expression identified by microarray
analysis were considered significant if p % 0.001, and a difference in Z scores >
1.96 was considered a significant difference between the WL and WL-HP
groups. Data are presented as mean ± SEM, unless indicated otherwise.
