SUMMARY
Adult-born granule cells (abGCs) have been impli-
cated in cognition and mood; however, it remains
unknown how these cells behave in vivo. Here, we
have used two-photon calcium imaging to monitor
the activity of young abGCs in awake behaving
mice. We find that young adult-born neurons fire at
a higher rate in vivo but paradoxically exhibit less
spatial tuning than their mature counterparts. When
presented with different contexts, mature granule
cells underwent robust remapping of their spatial
representations, and the few spatially tuned adult-
born cells remapped to a similar degree. We next
used optogenetic silencing to confirm the direct
involvement of abGCs in context encoding and
discrimination, consistent with their proposed role
in pattern separation. These results provide the first
in vivo characterization of abGCs and reveal their
participation in the encoding of novel information.
INTRODUCTION
Hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain is a
process by which new dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells
(GCs) are generated and functionally integrated into hippo-
campal circuitry (Drew et al., 2013; Toni et al., 2007, 2008;
van Praag et al., 2002). In both rodents and humans, a signif-
icant fraction of DG neurons are replaced by neurons gener-
ated in adulthood (Imayoshi et al., 2008; Spalding et al.,
2013). Why this is the case and precisely how young adult-
born GCs (abGCs) alter hippocampal circuit function remain
open questions.
Behavioral studies have implicated abGCs in memory forma-
tion (Zhao et al., 2008); stress and anxiety (Snyder et al., 2011);
responses to antidepressant treatments (David et al., 2009; San-
tarelli et al., 2003); and, most recently, in behaviors requiring
contextual discrimination, consistent with a role in pattern sepa-
ration (Clelland et al., 2009; Kheirbek et al., 2012a; Nakashiba
et al., 2012; Sahay et al., 2011a). However, such studies have pri-
marily inferred functions of abGCs from experiments in which
adult neurogenesis was chronically ablated or enhanced, i.e.,
long-term
manipulations
that
may
induce
compensatory
changes (Singer et al., 2011) and/or result in the recruitment of
alternative behavioral or cognitive strategies. Furthermore, in
these designs abGCs are either absent or more abundant during
all phases of testing.
Hypotheses attempting to explain the role of abGCs range
from modulating the activity of mature GCs (mGCs) through in-
teractions with local interneurons, to themselves providing the
DG’s principal output signals (Piatti et al., 2013; Sahay et al.,
2011b). Brain slice preparations have provided additional insight
into the possible mechanisms by which they may uniquely influ-
ence circuit function (Dieni et al., 2013; Marı
´n-Burgin et al., 2012;
Temprana et al., 2015; van Praag et al., 2002). For example,
adult-born neurons undergo a period of heightened synaptic
plasticity 4–6 weeks postmitosis, a critical period during which
they have been proposed to have a distinct contribution to
behavior (Denny et al., 2012; Ge et al., 2007; Kheirbek et al.,
2012b; Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2004). Further observed differ-
ences in excitability and plasticity could allow abGCs to encode
and transfer information differently than mGCs (Ge et al., 2007;
Gu et al., 2012; Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2004; van Praag et al.,
2002). However, at present there are no data from the intact brain
directly comparing the firing patterns of these subpopulations
during behavior. This is because in vivo identification of mGCs
and abGCs with electrophysiological approaches remains tech-
nically challenging (Jung and McNaughton, 1993; Leutgeb et al.,
Neuron 90, 101–112, April 6, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc.
101
 2007; Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012; Pernı
´a-Andrade and Jonas,
2014). Studies using immediate early gene expression as a proxy
for neuronal activation have not identified significant differences
in the recruitment of mGCs and abGCs (Stone et al., 2011) during
contextual encoding, but this methodology fails to capture the
dynamic nature of neuronal encoding.
Here, we have recorded the activity of abGCs in vivo,
providing the first functional characterization of identified
abGCs. Although these cells are more active than mGCs in vivo,
they are less spatially tuned. Furthermore, we found that mGCs
robustly discriminated contexts on the basis of their spatial tun-
ing, while the small population of spatially tuned abGCs seemed
to discriminate contexts to a similar or lesser degree, depending
on the inclusion criteria and remapping metric applied. We
confirmed this online participation of abGCs to the encoding of
novel information by transiently suppressing abGCs’s activity
in distinct epochs of conditioning paradigms, where we showed
their essential role in behavioral pattern separation. These exper-
iments extend our understanding of the unique contribution of
abGCs to behavior and provide the first characterization of their
activity in vivo.
RESULTS
Two-Photon Calcium Imaging of DG GCs In Vivo
To gain insight into how abGCs behave in vivo, we sought to
directly observe their activity in the intact brain in response to
the manipulation of spatial and contextual cues. This was
achieved by performing calcium imaging of the DG in head-
restrained mice as they explored a linear virtual environment
(Kaifosh et al., 2013; Lovett-Barron et al., 2014) (Figure 1A).
Use of this method allowed us to image the activity of abGCs
and mGCs simultaneously, which is not yet technically feasible
in freely moving mice. To label abGCs, NestinCreERT2 mice (Dra-
novsky et al., 2011) were crossed with a conditional tdTomato re-
porter line (NestintdTomato) and pulsed with tamoxifen (TMX)
6 weeks prior to imaging. This led to labeling of 89.5% ± 3.8%
of the DCX population of immature cells 6 weeks after induction,
indicating �10% of abGCs were not labeled and thus were not
characterized as abGCs. Mice were stereotactically injected in
the dorsal DG with a virus expressing GCaMP6f in all GCs.
Implantation of a chronic imaging window over the dorsal DG
provided the optical access necessary for cell-type-specific im-
aging of the DG GC layer (Figures 1A and S1, available online).
This preparation did not impair hippocampal-dependent contex-
tual conditioning, nor did it impact the overall level of activity in
the DG. In addition, window implantation did not impact total
number of tdTomato+ abGCs, their dendritic morphology, or
the number of proliferating cells in the implanted hemisphere.
In total, we imaged 7,950 mGCs (tdTomato negative) and 446
abGCs (tdTomato positive) from 11 fields of view (FOVs) across
6 mice (Figure S1). The same FOV (Figure S2) was imaged over
three trials in which the mouse explored two linear virtual con-
texts. On the first trial, the mouse explored one of the two con-
texts (A; chosen at random), then for both the second and third
trials it explored the second context (B). This paradigm allowed
us to compare activity levels, spatial firing patterns, and remap-
ping dynamics in abGCs and mGCs simultaneously.
abGCs Are More Active Than mGCs In Vivo
Consistent with electrophysiological studies reporting sparse
GC activity (Alme et al., 2010; Leutgeb et al., 2007; Pernı
´a-An-
drade and Jonas, 2014; Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2014), detected
calcium transients (Figure S2A) were observed at very low rates
in both abGCs and mGCs (Figures 1B–1D; Movie S1). The level
of activity was dependent on the animal’s behavioral state (Leut-
geb et al., 2007; Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012), as calcium tran-
sients during running were observed at nearly 2-fold higher rate
than during nonrunning epochs (Figure S2C). Running-related
calcium transients occurred at significantly greater rates in
abGCs than in mGCs across all transients (Figures 1B and 1C)
as well as across FOVs (Figure 1D). This difference was most
pronounced in the FOVs that displayed the highest levels of ac-
tivity. The increased activity observed in vivo is consistent with
reports of greater responsiveness to perforant path activation
of abGCs in vitro (Marı
´n-Burgin et al., 2012). In addition to having
a lower overall fraction of silent cells, the abGC population also
contained a higher fraction of highly active cells (Figure 1C,
inset). Additionally, across FOVs, we did not detect differences
between mGCs and abGCs in the amplitude or duration of
detected transients suggesting similar activity-induced calcium
dynamics in the two populations (Figure S2B).
abGCs Are Less Spatially Tuned Than mGCs
We next assessed the degree to which abGCs and mGCs were
spatially tuned (Figure 2). To limit noise in estimates of the spatial
tuning metrics, we included only GC recordings with four or more
running-related transients during the trial. For each such GC
recording, we calculated a tuning vector as the mean of the vec-
tors pointing in the direction of the mouse’s position at the time of
each transient onset, inversely weighted by the mouse’s occu-
pancy of that position (Figures 2A, 2B, and S3). This vector’s
orientation and length defined the cell’s tuning direction and tun-
ing specificity, respectively. The mean spatial tuning specificity
was significantly lower for abGCs than for mGCs (Figure 2C).
We did not observe significant reward-related or velocity-related
activity in our recordings (Figure S4).
To assess the statistical significance of the tuning specificity
difference, for each GC we generated a null distribution by
randomly shuffling calcium transient onset times and repeat-
edly recomputing the tuning specificity. This allowed us to
calculate the p value as the fraction of this null distribution
that exceeded the GC’s tuning specificity. The p value distribu-
tions for both mGCs and abGCs differed significantly from
chance levels, indicating that spatially tuned cells existed within
both populations (Figure 2D). However, the p value distribution
for mGC populations was lower than that for abGCs (Figure 2D),
suggesting that as a population the mGCs demonstrate a
higher degree of spatial tuning than abGCs. Across all signifi-
cance thresholds, a higher fraction of mature neurons would
be categorized as spatially tuned than of young neurons. These
findings indicate that abGCs differ from mGCs not just in their
level of activity but also in the spatial information carried by
their activity.
To investigate whether the observed difference in spatial tun-
ing was dependent on the value of our inclusion threshold, we
compared the spatial tuning p values of mGCs and abGCs for
102

 different minimum numbers of running-related transients (Fig-
ure 2E). At all inclusion thresholds, mean p values were lower
for mGCs than for abGCs. As expected for a population in which
there was no relationship between spatial tuning and activity
level, the p values for mGCs decreased monotonically with
increasing inclusion threshold (statistical power increases, and
hence p values decrease with greater numbers of transients).
The lack of a similar decrease in abGCs suggests a dependence
of tuning on activity, whereby the most active abGCs tend to be
least tuned (see Figure S3).
It is important to note that a lower tuning specificity could be
consistent with an interpretation of multiple place fields, and a
difference in this metric could either be attributable to inconsis-
tent tuning or to tuning that is consistent but multipeaked or
broader. Estimating the precise number of fields was not
possible due to the sparsity of events observed. However, in or-
der to account for the possibility of multipeaked tuning profiles,
we also calculated the mutual information between the occu-
pancy-normalized Ca2+ transient rate maps and the mouse’s
position. The traditional definition of spatial information (Skaggs
et al., 1993), based on the method of sieves, is a highly biased
estimator in the setting of sparse firing rates, as were observed
in our data (Paninski, 2003), therefore it was not possible to
quantify absolute spatial information rates in these cells. How-
ever, a p value analysis derived similarly to that of tuning speci-
ficity above is immune to this bias, since both the calculated and

 shuffled distributions are calculated in the same manner (see
Experimental Procedures). This analysis, which is independent
of the tuning specificity metric and does not inherently select
for singly peaked tuning profiles, confirmed our primary results.
Spatial information p values and tuning specificity p values were
linearly related on a logarithmic scale, yielding largely over-
lapping populations of cells (Figures 4A and 4B). The spatial in-
formation p value distributions for both populations differed
significantly from chance levels, but the mGC p value distribution
was significantly lower than that of abGCs, again suggesting that
as a population abGCs are relatively less spatially tuned (Fig-
ure 4C). We also observed a similar relationship between the
minimum number of transients and the mean spatial information
p value as was described in the tuning specificity analysis (Fig-
ure 4D). We saw no consistent evidence of multipeaked firing
in the tuning profiles of recordings that satisfied the spatial infor-
mation, but not the tuning specificity criterion. In summary, this
spatial information-based analysis further supports our finding
that as a population, abGCs are less sharply tuned than the
mGC population.
Contextual Discrimination by abGCs and mGCs
We next assessed the context specificity of spatial representa-
tions within the population of spatially tuned mGCs and abGCs
(Figure 3). We compared the similarity of GCs’ spatial tuning
between two sequential exposures to either similar (‘‘A-B’’) or

Stat = 0.217, p < 0.01).
(D) Cumulative distributions of tuning specificity p values. The p value distributions for mGCs and abGCs differed significantly from each other (p < 0.05; KS test,
KS Stat = 0.18) and from the uniform distribution (diagonal dashed line) expected in the case of a nonspatially tuned population (p < 0.001 for both mGCs and
abGCs; KS test, abGCs, KS Stat = 0.25, mGCs KS Stat = 0.35). Gray dashed line indicates p = 0.1.
(E) Mean logarithm of the p value for mGCs and abGCs with differing inclusion thresholds for the number of running-related calcium transients. For mGCs, the
p values monotonically decrease with increasing inclusion threshold, consistent with the increased statistical power provided by a greater numbers of transients.
The lack of such a decrease in the adult-born population suggests that the more active abGCs tend to be less tuned or consist of a mixed population of tuned and
untuned cells. The dashed black line shows the expected value for an untuned population.

 identical (‘‘B-B’’) contexts. The similar contexts A and B shared
the same treadmill belt but had different olfactory, auditory, vi-
sual, and tactile cues (Figure 3A). We focused our analysis on
cells with significant and well-estimated spatial tuning (at least
four running-related transients in both sessions and tuning spec-
ificity p value below 0.1 in at least one session; Figure 3B).
Spatially tuned mGCs displayed a higher correlation of their tun-
ing curves (Figures 3C, S5A, and S5B) and a smaller centroid
shift (angle between tuning directions; Figures 3D, S5A, and
S5B) in the B-B condition than in the A-B condition. The small
number of spatially tuned abGCs satisfying the inclusion criteria
displayed a significantly higher correlation of tuning curves in the
B-B condition than in A-B, but this result did not hold for the
centroid shift metric. When basing the inclusion criteria on
the spatial information p value, rather than on the tuning speci-
ficity, we similarly observed that mGCs remapped to a greater
degree in the A-B than the B-B conditions as assessed by
both metrics (Figures 4E and 4F). abGCs did not demonstrate
a significant difference in remapping in the A-B versus B-B com-
parison, though it is important to note that this was difficult to
assess given the low number of abGCs meeting the inclusion
threshold. While the A-B-B paradigm allowed us to measure
reorganization in response to the manipulation of a novel
context, B-B-A and other related paradigms will allow for
assessment of reorganization in a more familiar environment.
We next investigated whether DG GCs can discriminate be-
tween similar contexts solely on the basis of their activity level
throughout the exposure to these contexts, which would be
indicative of rate remapping (Figures 5, S5C, and S5D). To
determine this, we computed population vectors (Figure 5A)
whose components were the time-averaged calcium transient
rate (Figure 5B) or the transient AUC rate (Figure 5C) for each
cell during the trial. By measuring the angle between popula-
tion vectors (QB-B, QA-B) we found that for both mGCs and
abGCs
the
population
vectors
were
as
closely
aligned
between sequential exposures to the same (B-B) versus
different (A-B) contexts. To control for the disparities in
sample size between adult-born and mature populations, we
studied the pseudopopulation vectors (Figure 5D) obtained
by pooling GCs across all FOVs. The contextual specificity
(QB-B � QA-B) for the abGC pseudopopulation fell well within
the distribution obtained from random subsamplings of the
mGC pseudopopulations for both the transient rate (Figure 5E)
and transient AUC rate (Figure 5F) vectors. This indicates that
in
our
experimental
paradigm,
both
abGCs
and
mGCs
discriminate between contexts at the level of their spatial
tuning rather than through spatially independent changes in
firing rate.
abGCs Actively Participate in the Encoding of Novel
Information
Finally, we asked whether abGCs are required for encoding a
novel environment. In order to address this question, we ex-
pressed archaerhodopsin (Arch) in abGCs by crossing the

relations of both populations were more similar in
the B-B condition than in A-B (Mann-Whitney U,
mGCs: U(150) = 5,291, p < 0.001; abGCs: U(18) =
23.0, p < 0.05). In mGCs the tuning shift was larger
in the A-B condition than in B-B, although this did
not reach significance in abGCs (mGCs: U(150) =
5,714, p < 0.001; abGCs: U(18) = 40.0, p = 0.34). In
both conditions, the similarity of spatial represen-
tations exceeded chance levels as estimated by
shuffling cell identity (gray).

 NestinCreERT2 mouse line with conditional Arch-eGFP mice
(Madisen et al., 2012) (NestinArch; Figure 6A). NestinArch mice
given TMX in adulthood expressed the transgene in �80%–
90% of abGCs in the DG (Figure S6). Targeted fiber optic
implantation allowed local light delivery and thus control of
6-week-old and younger DG abGCs expressing Arch during
behavior (Figure 6A). To examine effects on context encoding,
mice received local illumination of the dorsal DG as they
explored a conditioning context before receiving a single
foot shock; they were then exposed to this same context
24 hr later in the absence of light. NestinArch mice froze
significantly less than control mice, indicating that activity in
abGCs
was
required
for
effective
contextual
encoding
(Figure 6B). Optical stimulation of abGCs impaired con-
ditioning, presumably by disrupting the circuit (Figure S6).
Optical modulation of abGCs did not impact shock reactivity,
anxiety-related
behavior,
or
general
locomotor
activity
(Table S1).
We next tested whether transient inhibition of abGCs impacts
behavioral pattern separation, the ability to discriminate between
similar contexts, which has been proposed to require abGCs
(Clelland et al., 2009; Kheirbek et al., 2012a; Nakashiba et al.,
2012; Sahay et al., 2011a). We suppressed abGC activity either
during exposure to the conditioning context A or to the similar,
nonconditioned context B (Figures 6C and 6D). While silencing
abGCs during exposure to the conditioning context did not impair
the development of a discriminatory response (Figure 6C),
silencing these cells during exposure to the similar context
resulted in impaired discrimination (Figure 6D), indicating that
activity of the abGCs is required for behavioral pattern separation
specifically during exposure to the ambiguous context. NestinArch
mice could discriminate between very distinct contexts and be-
tween similar contexts when silencing was performed after the
mice had already learned to discriminate (Figure S6). Together,
these data extend our understanding of the role played by abGCs
during pattern separation on a behavioral level.

the B-B condition than in A-B. This relationship was not observed (Mann-Whitney U; E; U(14) = 26.0, p = 0.45; F; U(14) = 23.0, p = 0.32) in the few abGCs (A-B, n = 11;

 DISCUSSION
The results presented herein expand our understanding of the
contribution of abGCs to the function of the DG. We found that
activity was sparse in both the mGC and abGC populations,
consistent with in vivo extracellular electrophysiological studies
and intracellular recordings (Alme et al., 2010; Leutgeb et al.,
2007; Pernı
´a-Andrade and Jonas, 2014; Schmidt-Hieber et al.,
2014). By monitoring for the first time in vivo the activity of this
population of cells while mice explored multisensory contexts,
we reveal that GCs 6 weeks and younger fire at a higher rate
in vivo than the mature population, complementing recent find-
ings showing that young GCs are more excitable in in vitro prep-
arations (Marı
´n-Burgin et al., 2012). In the absence of combined
electrophysiological recordings, we cannot eliminate the possi-
bility that transient differences in Ca2+ buffering might affect
our activity estimates (Brandt et al., 2003), though we detected
no consistent differences in the amplitude or duration of de-
tected somatic Ca2+ transients (see also Marı
´n-Burgin et al.,
2012) at the FOV or individual mouse level.
We further found that abGCs were less spatially tuned than
mGCs. The lower tuning specificity we observed could either
be attributable to less stable spatial firing patterns or to the pres-
ence of stable but multipeaked tuning profiles, as might be ex-
pected from recent electrophysiological recordings describing
broader, multipeaked tuning profiles at the hilar-GCL border,
where most abGCs reside (Alme et al., 2010; Neunuebel and
Knierim, 2012). In addition to a lower tuning specificity, however,
we found that abGCs fire with relatively less spatial information.
Although our behavioral paradigm did not allow for the system-
atic study of time coding (Kraus et al., 2013; MacDonald et al.,
2011) in the GC population, we did not find that GC activity
was related to other dimensions of the task, such as reward or
velocity (Kropff et al., 2015).
Our results also suggested the existence of a relationship be-
tween activity and tuning in abGCs, in which the highly active
abGCs are less spatially tuned. These results may be related
to the maturational heterogeneity of the labeled cells and are
consistent with a model in which young abGCs are initially
more active and less spatially tuned but within 6 weeks become
more similar to the less active and more spatially tuned mature
cells. It is important to note that the NestintdTomato labeling sys-
tem does not provide an exact birthdate of the recorded neurons
but rather results in the cumulative labeling of abGCs 6 weeks
and younger. Consequently, we are unable to unequivocally
distinguish abGCs between 0 and 6 weeks in our recordings.
The recorded abGCs exhibited strong state-dependent modula-
tion (Figure S2C), presumably driven by their glutamatergic
innervation and local integration into the DG circuit. As both of
these developmental events have been demonstrated to occur
after approximately 3 weeks of development (Espo
´ sito et al.,
2005; Ge et al., 2006, 2007; Toni et al., 2007), this suggests
that our functional characterization was based predominantly
on cells in the 3–6 week age range. Future studies incorporating
the imaging techniques described here with retroviral ap-
proaches for labeling age-matched cohorts of abGCs will allow
for a more detailed determination of the developmental timeline
of abGC properties in vivo. Such future studies will allow us to
track (in the 3–6 week range) the transition from an immature
to a mature functional phenotype.
Our in vivo imaging data suggest that the small population of
spatially tuned abGCs differentiated novel contexts on the basis

 of their spatial tuning to a similar and possibly weaker degree
than mGCs, depending on the metric and inclusion criteria
applied. This, combined with the fact that we observed so few
well-tuned abGCs in spite of our large number of recordings,
suggests that the unique role of abGCs in contextual discrimina-
tion behaviors may not be attributable to the spatial distribution

 of their firing or the remapping of their fields. The broader tuning
profile of abGCs (compared to mGCs) is consistent with compu-
tational models of GC dynamics and might support the encoding
of novel features in the environment (Aimone et al., 2011; Tem-
prana et al., 2015). This would also be consistent with our finding
that silencing these neurons during exposure to the novel
context (but not the familiar one) prevents contextual discrimina-
tion learning. Alternatively, the abGC population may modulate
local excitatory/inhibitory tone in the DG and CA3 (Gu et al.,
2012; Restivo et al., 2015; Toni et al., 2008) and could conse-
quently shape spatial and contextual representations. There is
indeed evidence from ablation studies that abGCs may modu-
late the activity of mGCs, possibly via their influence on the DG
microcircuit (Burghardt et al., 2012; Drew et al., 2015; Ikrar
et al., 2013; Lacefield et al., 2012; Park et al., 2015). Future
studies should test this hypothesis directly by using the methods
described here to assess changes in mGC spatial and contextual
representations following inhibition of abGCs.
In addition, we find that transient inhibition of abGCs impairs
behavior, specifically contextual encoding and discrimination,
consistent with a proposed role in behavioral pattern separation
(Clelland et al., 2009; Kheirbek et al., 2012a, 2012b; Nakashiba
et al., 2012; Sahay et al., 2011a). These studies complement
recent optogenetic studies describing a role for DG GCs in mem-
ory processes (Denny et al., 2014; Gu et al., 2012; Kheirbek et al.,
2013). Furthermore, we demonstrate that in a pattern separation
task, activity of the abGCs is required during exposure to the
novel ambiguous context, but not during exposure to the condi-
tioning context. This is likely due to a deficit in contextual encod-
ing, due to an inability in NestinArch mice to encode context B as
the safe context. This is in agreement with our results in one-trial
contextual fear conditioning, where silencing abGCs during the
first exposure to context A impaired the ability to encode this
context. In the pattern separation experiment, when abGC
silencing takes place in context A, freezing keeps increasing
because learning is reinforced each day by a foot shock. In
contrast, when silencing takes place in context B, freezing de-
creases in both contexts. This suggests that in these conditions,
mice were confused when exposed to both contexts A and B and
could no longer encode them as safe or fearful nor discriminate
between them.
It is important to note that in this study, the behavior measured
during optical inhibition of abGCs in contextual fear discrimina-
tion tasks differed from that in the head-fixed preparation during
imaging. It was not possible for us to perform our behavioral and
imaging experiments in identical conditions, as animals are
known to freeze in response to an unconditioned stimulus in
our head-fixed paradigm, and thus we cannot measure spatial
tuning and remapping in a fear-conditioned animal. Future ex-
periments combining freely moving in vivo imaging designs (Ziv
et al., 2013) with behavioral pattern separation tasks will allow
for analysis of changes in abGC response profiles to novel or
conditioned contexts.
Our experimental preparation required a partial lesion of ipsi-
lateral area CA1 in order to obtain high-resolution optical access
to the DG. While DG-mediated behavior was normal in the exper-
imental animals (Figures S1D and S1E), we cannot rule out the
possibility that chronic circuit reorganization or the implementa-
tion of an alternate circuit strategy might occur in this pre-
paration. Although the implant did not impact overall levels of
neurogenesis, or the morphological features of recorded abGCs,
we cannot exclude the possibility that the properties of abGCs
and mGCs may be differentially affected by the surgical prepara-
tion, due, for example, to the potential disruption of grid cell ac-
tivity in the medial entorhinal cortex (Bonnevie et al., 2013). In the
future, less-invasive techniques should complement the results
of this study.
Our data not only demonstrate the importance of abGCs for
encoding and disambiguating contextual information but also
provide insights into the circuit dynamics underlying these pro-
cesses. Impairments in pattern separation have been proposed
to contribute to the excessive generalization of memory often
seen in anxiety and depression as well as in age-related disor-
ders such as mild cognitive impairment (Kheirbek et al., 2012a;
Leal et al., 2014; Yassa et al., 2011). A mechanistic understand-
ing of how abGCs contribute to hippocampus-dependent
memory processing will provide insights not only into the normal
function of adult hippocampal neurogenesis but also into the
therapeutic potential of this unique form of plasticity.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Full details of the experimental procedures are provided in the Supplemental
Information.
Mice, Viruses, and Stereotactic Surgery
All experiments were conducted in accordance with the U.S. NIH guidelines
and with the approval of the Columbia University and New York State Psychi-
atric Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Male Ai9, Ai35,
Nestin-CreERT2, and controls were generated as previously described (Dra-
novsky et al., 2011; Madisen et al., 2010, 2012). For imaging experiments,
recombinant adeno-associated viruses carrying the GCaMP6f gene were ob-
tained from the Penn Vector Core (AAV1.Syn.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40) with titer
of 2–4 3 1013. The dorsal DG of male mice (8 weeks of age) was stereotacti-
cally injected at �1.5 mm AP; �2.3 mm ML; and �1.8, �1.65, �1.5 mm DV
relative to the cortical surface. Mice were then surgically implanted with an im-
aging window over the left dorsal DG and implanted with a stainless-steel
headpost for head fixation during imaging experiments (see Supplemental
Information). For optogenetic experiments, male mice (8 weeks of age) were
surgically implanted with fiber optics targeted to the dorsal DG (±1 mm ML,
�1.5 mm AP, �1.7 mm DV) using published protocols (Kheirbek et al., 2013).
In Vivo Two-Photon Imaging
We used the same imaging system as described previously (Kaifosh et al.,
2013; Lovett-Barron et al., 2014), with the addition of an 8 kHz resonant galva-
nometer (Bruker). All images were acquired with a Nikon 403 NIR water-im-
mersion objective (0.8 NA, 3.5 mm WD) in distilled water. We continuously
acquired red (tdTomato) and green (GCaMP6f) channels separated by an
emission cube set (green, HQ525/70 m-2p; red, HQ607/45 m-2p; 575dcxr,
Chroma Technology) at 1024 3 1024 pixels covering 300 mm 3 300 mm at
15 Hz with photomultiplier tubes (green GCaMP fluorescence, GaAsP PMT,
Hamamatsu Model 7422P-40; red tdTomato fluorescence, multialkali PMT,
Hamamatsu R3896). A custom dual stage preamp (1.4 3 105 dB, Bruker)
was used to amplify signals prior to digitization.
For training, mice were water restricted (>90% predeprivation weight) and
trained to run on a cue-deplete burlap treadmill belt for water reward over
the course of 1–2 weeks. We applied a progressively restrictive water reward
schedule, with mice initially receiving 40 randomly placed rewards per lap and
ultimately receiving 3 randomly placed rewards per lap. Mice were habituated
to the optical instrumentation, then trained for 20 min daily until they regularly
ran at least one lap per minute. For contexts, similar to our previous work, each

 context (1 and 2) consisted of the same treadmill belt (the same sequence of
three joined fabric ribbons) but was distinct in its visual, auditory, tactile, and
olfactory stimuli (Figure 4A) (Lovett-Barron et al., 2014). During imaging ses-
sions, mice received three randomly placed water rewards per lap, with reward
positions changing randomly each lap. To allow for comparison of GC activity
between similar contexts, the same three fabrics were used in the same order,
but the locations of all of the tactile cues were shuffled between the two belts.
Imaging Analysis
Processing of Ca2+ Fluorescence Data
All imaging data were analyzed using the SIMA software package (Kaifosh
et al., 2014). Motion correction was performed using a 2D Hidden Markov
Model (Dombeck et al., 2007; Kaifosh et al., 2013), with modifications to
accommodate the specific features of data acquired with resonant galvanom-
eters. Only the green GCaMP channel was used for estimating motion arti-
facts. In cases where motion artifacts were not adequately corrected, the
affected data were discarded from further analysis. The especially sparse ac-
tivity of dentate GCs prevented the successful application of activity-based
segmentation methods. Therefore, we used the SIMA project’s ROI Buddy
graphical user interface (Kaifosh et al., 2014) to draw regions of interest
(ROIs) over GC somata visible in the time-averaged image of the motion-cor-
rected green/GCaMP6f channel. We also used this software to determine the
correspondence of ROIs across datasets from different trials in which the
same FOV was imaged. To prevent the introduction of any bias, the red
tdTomato channel was not viewed when drawing ROIs but only referenced
after all ROIs had been drawn in order to tag ROIs over tdTomato-expressing
cells as newborn GCs.
Dynamic GCaMP6f fluorescence signals were extracted from ROIs using
SIMA according to the previously described formulation (Kaifosh et al.,
2014). We then computed the relative fluorescence changes (DF/F) (as
described in Jia et al., 2011), with uniform smoothing window t1 = 3 s and base-
line size t2 = 60 s. We detected statistically significant calcium transients as
described previously (Dombeck et al., 2007; Lovett-Barron et al., 2014). In or-
der to improve our sensitivity, we then recalculated the baseline of the raw
signal after masking frames identified previously as occurring during a
significant transient. DF/F was then recalculated and transients re-estimated.
Transients less than 1 s were removed to reduce false positives. This iterative
procedure was repeated three times and effectively removed the transient
contamination from the calculated baseline.
Spatial Tuning Vector and Tuning Specificity p Value Analysis
When evaluating the spatial tuning of GCs, we restricted our analysis to
running-related epochs, defined as consecutive frames of forward locomotion
(defined as an imaging frame in which at least one forward pair of beam breaks
occurred) at least 1 s in duration and with a minimum peak speed of 5 cm/sec.
Consecutive epochs separated by <0.5 s were merged. Running-related tran-
sients were defined as those that were initiated during a running-related
epoch. Transient start was defined as the first imaging frame with mean fluo-
rescence R2 s , with s equal to the SD of the baseline frames. Offset was
defined as the first frame with mean fluorescence %0.5 s (Dombeck et al.,
2007). The spatial tuning vector was calculated as P
j
eiqj
oðqjÞ, where qj is the posi-
tion of the mouse at the onset time of the jth running-related transient, and oj is
the fraction of running frames acquired at position qj. Only the animal’s position
at the time of transient onset was used for constructing the tuning vector and
rate maps (see Remapping Analysis section below), as the calcium decay
kinetics are intrinsic to the GCaMP6f indicator and are not sensitive to the
animal’s running speed (a similar onset-based approach was implemented
previously by Ziv et al., 2013). In order to assess the significance of the spatial
selectivity, for each cell we generated a null tuning distribution by shuffling the
transient onset times (restricted to running frames) and repeatedly recomput-
ing the tuning specificity. This process was repeated 100,000 times, and the
p value was defined as the fraction of this distribution that exceeded the
GC’s tuning specificity.
Spatial Information p Value Analysis
For each cell we first computed the spatial information content (Skaggs et al.,
1993) as IN = PN
i = 1li ln li
l pi, where li and pi are the transient rate and fraction of
time spent in the i th bin, l is the overall firing rate, and N is the number of bins.
We computed IN for multiple values of N = 2; 4; 5; 8; 10; 20; 25; and 100.
We then created 100,000 random reassignments of the transient onset times
within the running-related epochs and recomputed the values of Is
N, where s is
the index of the shuffle. To roughly correct for biases in the calculation of
mutual information, we then subtracted the mean of this null distribution
from all estimates to obtain values b
IN = IN �

100;000

s = 1
Is
N. Finally, we
computed a single estimate of the information content for the true transient
onset times, b
I = maxNb
IN, and for the shuffles, b
Is = maxNb
I
s
N. The spatial tuning
p value was taken as the fraction of values of s for which b
I exceeded b
Is.
Remapping Analysis
Rate maps were formed by dividing the number of transients starting in each
bin by the occupancy of that bin. We calculated rate maps with 100 position
bins and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (s = 3 bins). The tuning curve cor-
relation for each cell was defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient be-
tween tuning curves for a cell in the two sequential context exposures. The
centroid shift for each cell was defined as the angle (in radians) between the
tuning directions calculated for the two context exposures. For both metrics,
the shuffle distributions were calculated by estimating the tuning curve corre-
lations or tuning shifts when cells were paired by a subsampled Cartesian
product of cell identities (1,000 pairs per shuffle).
Behavioral Testing
In Arch experiments, the patch cables were interfaced to an FC/PC rotary joint
(Doric lenses), which was attached on the other end to a 593.5 nm laser diode
that was controlled by a Master-8 stimulator (AMPI). Fear conditioning took
place in Coulbourn Instruments fear conditioning boxes. See Supplemental In-
formation for full details of behavioral procedures.
Statistics
For all optogenetic behavioral data, data were analyzed using ANOVA with
repeated measurements where appropriate. All tests are described in the
appropriate figure legends. Group numbers were based on previous optoge-
netic and two-photon imaging experiments (Kheirbek et al., 2013; Lovett-Bar-
ron et al., 2014). For imaging data, for all normally distributed data, a Welch’s
two-sample t test was used for comparison of means with n � 1 degrees of
freedom. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison of means in non-
normally distributed data with n � 1 degrees of freedom. A paired student’s
t test was used for comparison of means in paired data with n � 1 degrees
of freedom. The one-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test was used for testing
the hypothesis that a distribution was drawn from an underlying theoretical
distribution with n � 1 degrees of freedom (uniformity in the case of Figure 2E).
The two-sided two-sample KS test with n � 1 degrees of freedom was used for
testing the null hypothesis that two empirical distributions were drawn from the
same continuous underlying distribution.
