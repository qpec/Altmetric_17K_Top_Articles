ABSTRACT The explosion of atom bombs over the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 resulted in very high casualties, both
immediate and delayed but also left a large number of survivors who had been exposed to radiation, at levels that could be fairly precisely
ascertained. Extensive follow-up of a large cohort of survivors (120,000) and of their offspring (77,000) was initiated in 1947 and continues
to this day. In essence, survivors having received 1 Gy irradiation (�1000 mSV) have a significantly elevated rate of cancer (42% increase)
but a limited decrease of longevity (�1 year), while their offspring show no increased frequency of abnormalities and, so far, no detectable
elevation of the mutation rate. Current acceptable exposure levels for the general population and for workers in the nuclear industry have
largely been derived from these studies, which have been reported in more than 100 publications. Yet the general public, and indeed most
scientists, are unaware of these data: it is widely believed that irradiated survivors suffered a very high cancer burden and dramatically
shortened life span, and that their progeny were affected by elevated mutation rates and frequent abnormalities. In this article, I summarize
the results and discuss possible reasons for this very striking discrepancy between the facts and general beliefs about this situation.
T
HE first (and only) two A-bombs used in war were deto-
nated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9,
1945. Casualties were horrendous, approximately 100,000 in
each city including deaths in the following days from severe
burns and radiation. Although massive bombing of cities had
already taken place with similar death tolls (e.g., Dresden,
Hamburg, and Tokyo, the latter with 100,000 casualties on
March 9, 1945), the devastation caused by a single bomb was
unheard of and remains one of the most horrifying events in
the past century. The people who had survived the explosions
were soon designated as Hibakusha and were severely discrim-
inated against in Japanese society, as (supposedly) carriers of
(contagious?) radiation diseases and potential begetters of
malformed offspring. While not reaching such extremes, the
dominant present-day image of the aftermath of the Hiroshima/
Nagasaki bombings, in line with the general perception of
radiation risk (Ropeik 2013; Perko 2014), is that it left the sites
heavily contaminated, that the survivors suffered very serious
health consequences, notably a very high rate of cancer and
other debilitating diseases, and that offspring from these sur-
vivors had a highly increased rate of genetic defects. In fact,
the survivors have been the object of massive and careful long-
term studies whose results to date do not support these
conceptions and indicate, instead, measurable but limited det-
rimental health effects in survivors, and no detectable genetic
effects in their offspring. This Perspectives article does not
provide any new data; rather, its aim is to summarize the
results of the studies undertaken to date, which have been
published in more than 100 papers (most of them in interna-
tional journals), and to discuss why they seem to have had so
little impact beyond specialized circles.

 equivalent to 16 kilotons of high explosive. The bomb at
Nagasaki was based on plutonium and exploded at 500 m
with a yield of 21 kilotons. The major effect of both bombs was
an extreme heat and pressure blast accompanied by a strong
burst of gamma radiation and a more limited burst of neutrons.
The heat blast set the (mostly wooden) buildings on fire in a
radius of several kilometers and resulted in an extensive fire-
storm centered on the explosion site (also called the hypocen-
ter). People were exposed to the combined heat and radiation
blasts, with little shielding from the buildings; most of those
located within 1.5 km of the hypocenter were killed. The
contribution of fallout from these explosions, which occurred
mostly as “black rain” in the following days, is not precisely
known: few measurements were taken due to scarcity of
equipment, and investigations in the first months were per-
formed by the US army and subsequently classified. It was
probably limited: the bombs exploded at a significant altitude,
the resulting firestorm carried the fission products into the
high atmosphere, and the eventual fallout was spread over a
large area. In addition, a strong typhoon occurred 2 weeks
after the bombings and may have washed out much of the
materiel. The major health effects (other than the heat blast
and accompanying destruction) were almost certainly due to
the gamma and neutron radiation from the blasts themselves,
and these doses can be quite reliably estimated from the dis-
tance to the hypocenter. Thus studies on the survivors can
ascertain the health effects of a single, fairly well-defined dose
of gamma radiation with a small component from neutrons.
The Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission and the
Radiation Effects Research Foundation
Initial studies (1945–1946) on survivors from the bombings
were performed under the authority of the occupying US
army and their results remained classified; the number of
delayed deaths from radiation or, possibly, contamination is
therefore not known precisely, although it is probably of the
order of 10,000 for each site. Open studies were started in
1947, with the establishment of the Atomic Bomb Casualty
Commission (ABCC) by the US National Academy of Sci-
ences, joined a year later by the Japanese National Institutes
of Health, and including well-known geneticists such as
James Neel and William Schull. It initiated extensive health
studies on the survivors and was reorganized in 1975 to form
the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), a Japa-
nese foundation funded by both Japan (Ministry of Health)
and the United States (Department of Energy). Both institu-
tions have been criticized by the Japanese public for observ-
ing the victims but not providing medical assistance to them.
They have, however, fulfilled an extremely useful role in
establishing reliable data on radiation effects. A general de-
scription of the RERF and its activities (including references
to published studies) is accessible through the RERF Web site
(RERF 2014). The RERF currently employs �170 persons at
its main location in Hiroshima, as well as 50 in Nagasaki, with
staff from both Japan and the United States. The ABCC and,
later, the RERF, assembled a “Life Span Study” (LSS) cohort
of 120,000 individuals [�100,000 exposed at various
(known) levels and �20,000 controls, “not in city” at the time
of the bombings], and a cohort of 77,000 children born be-
tween 1946 and 1984 and for which at least one parent had
been exposed. These have been followed now for over
60 years in most cases, and their general health, life expec-
tancy, cancer incidence, and mortality ascertained. In addi-
tion, cytogenetic, biochemical, and molecular genetic studies
have also been performed on significant subsets. The popu-
lation followed represents approximately half of the people

 who were exposed in the bombings, and the fact that they
received a single dose of radiation that can be consistently
estimated makes the conclusions much more reliable than in
more complex situations such as the Chernobyl disaster (see
later). A detailed general overview of the results as of
2011 has been published (Douple et al. 2011). Current re-
sults from these studies (that are still ongoing) are summa-
rized below, first for survivors and then for their offspring.
Studies on Survivors
In both Hiroshima and Nagasaki, there was extensive mor-
tality in the days and weeks following the bombings, repre-
senting perhaps 10% of the casualties. It is difficult to separate
the effect of radiation (acute radiation syndrome, ARS) and,
possibly, of contamination from the consequences of burns
since most victims suffered both. Early studies, however, in-
dicated that the median lethal dose (LD50) from whole-body
gamma radiation is �2.5 Gy1 when little or no medical assis-
tance is available (5 Gy with extensive medical care). This
estimate is based on early studies at the bomb sites, but with
dose estimates refined according to later studies.
Cancer
In 1950, a survivor cohort was defined and detailed medical
follow-up established. From then on, the causes of death and
the excess due to radiation exposure could be ascertained. This
excludes mortality caused by ARS and other bomb-related
trauma,butnotmostdelayedeffects,exceptforasmallnumber
of leukemia deaths since this is the earliest neoplasm to appear.
The results of these studies have been published in a large
number of papers, mostly in specialized journals (such as
Radiation Research or the Journal of Radiation Research) but
occasionally in more widely read journals (The Lancet, the
American Journal of Human Genetics, Nature, etc.). Figure 1
shows the solid cancer cases in the whole exposed group from
the LSS survivor cohort, with the excess cases (in white) at-
tributable to radiation (by comparison with the control group
“not in town” from the same cohort). It is quite obvious from
Figure 1 that there is a measurable excess of cancer cases in the
exposed group, but also that this excess is relatively limited,
amounting at most to an increase of �30%, often much less.
Figure 1, however, tabulates results for the whole exposed
group, most of whose members have experienced a relatively
low dose of radiation: half of them received less than 0.1 Gy.
It is therefore more meaningful to look at the percentage of
excess cancers according to dose received, as shown in Table
1 (Preston et al. 2007). This time, all solid cancers are lumped
together, but the cases are broken down according to radia-
tion exposure. As expected, the fraction of excess cancers
increases with radiation dose, from a nearly negligible
1.8% below 0.1 Gy to 61% at 2 Gy or above. For a quite
sizeable exposure of 0.5–1 Gy,2 the figure is 29.5%, corre-
sponding to 206 excess solid cancer cases (all types) in a
group of 3173 persons. In other words, there is a clear excess
of cancer cases in strongly irradiated survivors, but this involves
less than 10% of the total. It is also important to note that
the excess risk is higher for people exposed at a young age,
that this risk persists through the subject’s lifetime, and that it
is �50% higher in women than in men (Douple et al. 2011).
For leukemias (Table 2), the outlook is both worse and
better (Preston et al. 2004): worse, as the fraction of excess
cases is larger (63% in the 0.5–1 Gy group), and better since,
given the rarity of the disease, this translates into a much
smaller number of excess cases, 19 for 3963 individuals.
Leukemias also appear earlier than solid cancers, as early as 4
or 5 years after exposure; thus, some of them may have been
missed in this accounting that started 5 years after the bombing.
Altogether, the picture that emerges is that, for quite
heavily irradiated survivors (e.g., the 0.5–1 Gy group), there
is a sizeable increase of neoplasms, especially leukemia but
also most solid cancers. It would be wrong, however, to as-
sume that all survivors are hit by this disease, since even in
this group the fraction affected is slightly above 20%, less
than one-third of this being attributable to radiation expo-
sure. The most recent report on the LSS cohort of survivors

This is a simplified version of Table 9 in Preston et al. (2007), which tabulates all cancers observed from 1958 through 1998 among 105,427 LSS cohort members. LSS, Life
Span Study.
1 Throughout this paper, radiation exposure is expressed using the gray unit (irradia-
tion resulting in the absorption of 1 joule per kilogram), which is the unit appropriate
for whole-body irradiation; for low levels of radiation and taking into account the
nature of radiation and the exposed tissue, the unit generally used is the sievert
(mSv, millisievert). For whole-body, mostly gamma-ray exposure, the two units are
roughly equivalent, i.e., 1 Gy �1 Sv = 1000 mSv.
2 Let us remember that 2.5 Gy is the LD50, and that the limit for annual exposure for
the general public is 1 mSv, i.e., �1 mGy.

 time 58% of the survivors had died) confirms these results
while increasing somewhat the excess relative risk (ERR)
associated with radiation; these results also indicate a depen-
dence on age at irradiation, with elevated risk for those irra-
diated when young. Overall, the ERR for all solid cancers
corresponding to a (very sizeable) irradiation of 1 Gy works
out as 0.42, and the ERR/radiation dose relationship appears
to be linear, with no indication of a threshold.
Other diseases and life span
Of course, cancer is not the only possible detrimental effect of
radiation exposure, which could have an influence on cardio-
vascular diseases, autoimmune syndromes, and other ailments.
BecauseofthesizeoftheLSScohortandtheexceptionalquality3
and duration of its follow-up, it is possible to look at the end
result, i.e., the longevity of individuals according to the radia-
tion dose received. The result is shown in Figure 2, reproduced
from the 2000 Lancet paper by Cologne and Preston (2000)
and showing data from the LSS cohort up to 1995. At that time,
approximately half of the original cohort had died, allowing a
reliable evaluation of life span. From Figure 2, it is clear that the
separation between the curves is limited, even for the one that
corresponds to a dose of .2 Gy. The median loss of life span at
1 Gy irradiation is 1.3 years, and decreases to 0.12 years at
0.1 Gy. Again, the effect is measurable, and follows the
expected dose/effect relationship, but its magnitude is quite
limited. As a comparison, note that in Russia, life expectancy
decreased by 5 years between 1990 and 1994, essentially be-
cause of social disruption impacting on living conditions and
healthcare (Notzon et al. 1998). As noted above, the survivors
may have been exposed to an additional (but unknown) irra-
diation due to fallout from the bombs; this would lead to an
overestimate of the gamma and neutron radiation effects. In
other words, it would not affect the major conclusion from this
section, that these effects are detectable but relatively limited
even for radiation doses of the order of 1 Gy.
Studies on the Offspring of Survivors
The large cohort of children of survivors (77,000 individuals)
is of particular interest: it should allow reliable estimation of
detectable genetic effects resulting from parental irradiation
thanks to its large size and to detailed follow-up over several
decades. It must be emphasized, however,that some members
of this group are still quite young: the cohort includes children
born from 1946 to 1984, and the latest published results (Grant
et al. 2015) are based on data as of December 31, 2009. Thus
late events (e.g., excess cancer cases) are likely to be underrep-
resented. In addition, the assessment of mutation rate has not
yet been performed directly by whole-genome or whole-exome
DNA sequencing. The indirect evaluation through examination
of the phenotype (incidence of malformations, age-specific
mortality) and the limited molecular data (gross chromosome
aberrations, mutations at microsatellite loci) lack sensitivity
to detect small increases in mutation rate or large increases
of point mutations of subtle phenotypic effect.

 (Douple et al., 2011), the children of survivors show no
detectable radiation-related pathology. The incidence of
malformations at birth does not increase if both parents have
been exposed (Neel and Schull 1991; Table 3). Of course,
such studies may not reveal recessive mutations that would
only become apparent in subsequent generations.
Inaddition,allattemptstodetectincreasesinmutationrate
(looking at chromosome aberrations, blood protein changes,
and minisatellite mutations at various loci) have so far given
negative results (Table 4).
Naturally, this does not mean that the radiation received
by parents has no genetic effect, only that this is not detect-
able with the techniques used: in particular, microsatellite
variation may not be a reliable indicator of mutation rates.
Current technology should allow much more extensive
investigations using DNA sequencing, which might allow
the detection of a small increase in mutation rate. The fact
that samples are available from individuals whose parents
have received quite diverse (but fairly well-known) doses
would be a great asset to make sure that whatever is
observed is actually radiation dependent. It is somewhat
surprising that detailed sequencing studies have not yet
been performed or, at least, reported—this may reflect both
funding issues at RERF and possibly reluctance to provide
samples to US collaborators. These investigations could
take the form of full genome sequencing on parent/off-
spring trios, which would enable a more direct estimate
of the mutation rates. It is true that such studies are tech-
nically demanding, as they require extremely high accuracy
to eliminate false positives and to provide a true evaluation
of mutation rates, but they are doable (see e.g., Roach et al.
2010). In any case, it is clear that—contrary to popular
belief—the genetic effects in humans of quite significant
radiation doses (of the order of 1 Gy) seem to be small,
indeed so far undetectable. This is in contrast with some
animal studies: for example, gamma irradiation of BALB/c
and CBA/Ca mice at, respectively, 1 and 2 Gy has been
found to double the mutation frequency in their progeny
(Barber et al. 2006), at least within expanded simple tan-
dem repeat sequences. It thus appears that humans are less
radiosensitive than mice, which makes evolutionary sense
in view of their much longer reproductive life span. The
mechanisms responsible for this difference, however, are
not clear. It is interesting to note that a recent study
(Abegglen et al., 2015) found multiple copies of the TP53
gene in the elephant genome and interpreted this as a
potential mechanism for cancer resistance in this large-bodied
and long-lived species.
Risk of death due to cancer or noncancer diseases in
offspring of irradiated survivors
A recent assessment of the risk of death among these offspring
(after 62 years of follow-up for the oldest members of this
cohort) (Grant et al. 2015) confirms these results and shows
no discernible effect of the radiation dose received by parents
on the risk of death either by cancer or other causes—i.e., no
indication of strongly deleterious health effects. More pre-
cisely, the risk of either cancer or noncancer mortality is not
correlated with maternal or paternal exposures, and all haz-
ard ratios are in the 0.9 to 1.1 range, even when the mother
and/or father have received an exposure of 1 Gy. In other
words, as the paper states, there is “no indication of delete-
rious health effects after 62 years”4 of follow-up. It is too early
to have lifespan results similar to those reported above for
survivors, since .90% of the offspring were still alive at the
cut-off date for the study (end of 2009), and, as already
mentioned, an excess of late-appearing pathologies such as
cancer may be still undetected. Nevertheless, as of today,
there is no discernible effect of the parental irradiation on
the health of their offspring, even for quite significant expo-
sures of 1 Gy (�1000 mSV), to be compared with current
safety standards of 1 mSv per year for the general population.
To conclude this section, the studies on the offspring of
irradiated survivors have so far not demonstrated excess
mutations or decrease of fitness in this group. These studies
are ongoing and may eventually reveal effects that have been
missedbecauseoftherelativelyyoungageofmostmembersof
thecohort as wellas the limitations of theassay methods used.
Inlightofthedataalreadyobtained,however,theseeffectsare
likely to be very limited.
Coming back to the issue of the possible contribution of
fallout to health effects in both exposed individuals and
their offspring, this would—if found to be more significant
than previously indicated—worsen the outcome in all
cases and thus lead to an overestimate of radiation effects.
This would not, however, affect the major conclusion of
these studies, i.e., the limited impact of significant irradi-
ation on the longevity of survivors and the absence of de-
tectable genetic effects in their offspring (apart from
children irradiated in utero).

 What These Results Tell Us
A very clear-cut set of studies
Compared to subsequent nuclear disasters involving nuclear
power stations (Chernobyl and Fukushima), the Hiroshima/
Nagasaki bombings provide data that are much more clear cut
and reliable. The Chernobyl disaster involved quite differ-
entiated populations: the “liquidators” who attempted to
quench the fires and dump shielding material onto the re-
actor, the local inhabitants, and the much larger population
potentially affected by the plume of radioactive fallout. There
were contributions from direct irradiation and from contam-
ination. In addition, extensive but disordered redistribution
of people took place, all in the framework of a largely dys-
functional administrative and political system. As a result
there has been no exhaustive and systematic follow-up, the
exact radiation exposure of most people is unknown, and the
estimates of the associated health effects vary wildly
(Williams 2008). The Fukushima accident also resulted in
the release of large amounts of radioactivity, and in exposure
of the surrounding population to a combination of irradiation
and contamination (Hasegawa et al. 2015). Thorough follow-
up studies have been initiated but uncertainties in the estima-
tion of radiation exposure and the fact that this has been quite
low (,10 mSv) for most of the exposed persons (excluding the
personnel working in the nuclear facility) (Tsubokura et al.,
2012) will limit the possible conclusions. In contrast, the RERF
studies include a large and representative population sample,
rely on a fairly accurate estimation of a single irradiation dose,
with a wide range of exposure within the cohort, and have been
able to follow in detail this population (as well as its offspring)
for more than half a century. They have, in fact, been essential
to defining the legal limits for radiation exposure from nuclear
activities, which are currently 1 mSv/year for the general public
and 20 mSv/year for workers in the nuclear industry.5
The picture obtained from these extensive and careful
studies is very different from the impressions that prevail in
the general public and even among many scientists (Perko
2014). The general perception is that survivors from these
cities were heavily affected by various types of cancer, and
suffered much shorter lives as a result. While it is true that the
rate of cancer was increased by almost 50% for those who
had received 1 Gy of radiation, most of the survivors did not
develop cancer and their average life span was reduced by
months, at most 1 year. Likewise, it is generally thought that
abnormal births, malformations, and extensive mutations are
common among the children of irradiated survivors, when in
fact the follow-up of 77,000 such children (excluding chil-
dren irradiated in utero) fails so far to show evidence of del-
eterious effects (Douple et al. 2011; Grant et al. 2015). These
studies should, of course, not lead to complacency about the
effects of accidents at nuclear power plants, and even less
with respect to the (still possible) prospect of a nuclear war,
that would involve huge amounts of fallout and very large ex-
posed populations. Nevertheless, concerning the Hiroshima/
Nagasaki bombings, there is indeed a large gap between the
results of careful studies backed by more than 100 scholarly
publications, and the perception of the situation as seen by
the general (and even scientific) public (Ropeik 2013).
Why this disparity?
This contradiction between the perceived (imagined) long-
term health effects of the Hiroshima/Nagasaki bombs and
the actual data are extremely striking. Part of this distortion
must stem from the fact that radiation is a new and unfamiliar
danger in the history of mankind, an agent that is unseen and
unfelt, whose nature and mode of action are mysterious.
Familiar dangers are more easily tolerated, as shown by the
absenceofconcern aboutdeathsduetotheuseofcoal,whether
theyaredirect,due toextractionactivities (dozens ofcasualties
every year inthe UnitedStates, thousands inChina) orindirect,
through atmospheric pollution (several 100,000 premature
deaths per year according to the World Health Organization).
In addition, radiation is associated with the instant obliteration
of two cities and 200,000 people, and with several decades
during which the risk of an all-out nuclear war, either by design
or by accident, was quite high and present in all minds.
On a more scientific level, the extreme sensitivity of radio-
activity detection systems also plays a role. Depending on the
type of radiation, a simple Geiger counter can detect radio-
activity levels as low as a few becquerels (1 Bq = 1 disinte-
gration per second) that would correspond in most
circumstances to very low irradiation levels, orders of mag-
nitude below 1 mSv/day.6 In other words, even simple hand-
held counters can detect minuscule levels of radioactivity and
cause alarm, even though they pose no actual danger. If de-
tection systems for pollutants and poisons were similarly

 sensitive, we would realize that these molecules are ubiquitous,
albeit at very low concentrations. Another contribution to anx-
iety has been the uncertainty about extrapolation of radiation
effects toward very low doses: since these effects are only mea-
surable for fairly high irradiation levels, they have to be esti-
mated by extrapolation for low doses. There have been debates
on this point, some arguing that there is a threshold below
which no biological effect occurs (assuming that DNA repair
mechanisms kick in and have ample time to repair any damage),
and others asserting that very low levels over long periods are
somehow more damaging than expected from linear extrapola-
tion. Both the latest RERF studies (Ozasa et al. 2012) and recent
very large-scale cohort studies covering 300,000 individu-
als working in the nuclear industry (Leuraud et al. 2015;
Richardson et al. 2015) indicate that the relationship between
irradiation levels and biological effects is probably linear down
to zero exposure—so there is an effect from very low doses,
even though it is very small: 10 mSv of accumulated exposure
are estimated to raise the risk of leukemia by 0.002% (Leuraud
et al. 2015). Thus even low doses of radiation entail some health
risks, but the magnitude of these risks is extremely small.
Finally, the handling of recent nuclear incidents by the
authorities has been particularly inept and has provided strong
grounds for public distrust. The Chernobyl disaster was denied
for several days by Soviet authorities while a strongly radioac-
tive plume was being swept by winds over Eastern and then
Western Europe; the French government repeatedly asserted
thatthisplumedidnotspreadoverFrance,whileitactuallywas
depositing significant (but relatively harmless) amounts of
radioactivity on the vegetation. More recently, the seriousness
of problems at the Fukushima power station was repeatedly
denied by Tepco, the company in charge of this plant, until the
scope of the disaster became evident to all. The credibility of
authorities over nuclear matters has become very low, and
sensational news stories abound, in which irradiation levels
are often expressed in microsieverts, which makes for impres-
sivefigures.Conspiracytheoriesargueforamassivecover-upof

Furthermore, there is indeed a gray area in the history of
the Hiroshima/Nagasaki bombings: during the first 2 years
(1945–1947), before the establishment of the ABCC (later
RERF), medical studies were performed by the US army
and their results were not disclosed. There may have been
significant casualties in this period from the fallout and
radioactive contamination that occurred in these two cit-
ies. At that time, at the beginning of the Cold War, the US
military-industrial complex advocated the potential use of
A-bombs as tactical weapons, and would definitely have
wanted to suppress evidence of risks from fallout, in order
to present them as “clean” weapons differing from conven-
tional explosives only in their potency. Thus it is indeed
possible that our knowledge on the aftermath of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki is incomplete. This does not, however, affect the
conclusions discussed in this Perspective article, which cover
the more than 60 years following the explosions, rely on
comparison of well-defined exposure groups, and show effects
that are clearly related to radiation dose.
A duty to correct distortions
The tremendous gap between public perception and actual
data is unfortunately not unique to radiation studies. It is easy
to list a number of cases where dangers are grossly exagger-
ated (e.g., foods from genetically modified organisms being
supposedly detrimental to health, on the basis of essentially
zero scientific evidence), or, on the opposite side, not recog-
nized in spite of strong and convergent scientific evidence
(anthropogenic climate change, until recently at least).
Sometimes, as in the topic of this article, these misrepresen-
tations are also present within the scientific community.
These distortions can be very damaging as they skew impor-
tant public debates, such as the choice of the best mix of
energy generating options for the future;7 I believe it is im-
portant to try to clear up these questions, and to disseminate
widely the scientific data when they exist, in order to allow
for a balanced debate and more rational decisions.
