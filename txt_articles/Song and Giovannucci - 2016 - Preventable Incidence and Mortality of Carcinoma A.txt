Preventable Incidence and Mortality of Carcinoma
Associated With Lifestyle Factors Among White Adults
in the United States
Mingyang Song, MD, ScD; Edward Giovannucci, MD, ScD
IMPORTANCE Lifestyle factors are important for cancer development. However, a recent
study has been interpreted to suggest that random mutations during stem cell divisions are
the major contributor to human cancer.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the proportion of cases and deaths of carcinoma (all cancers except
skin, brain, lymphatic, hematologic, and nonfatal prostate malignancies) among whites in the
United States that can be potentially prevented by lifestyle modification.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study analyzes cancer and
lifestyle data from the Nurses’Health Study, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, and US
national cancer statistics to evaluate associations between lifestyle and cancer incidence and
mortality.
EXPOSURES A healthy lifestyle pattern was defined as never or past smoking (pack-years <5),
no or moderate alcohol drinking (�1 drink/d for women, �2 drinks/d for men), BMI of at least
18.5 but lower than 27.5, and weekly aerobic physical activity of at least 75 vigorous-intensity
or 150 moderate-intensity minutes. Participants meeting all 4 of these criteria made up the
low-risk group; all others, the high-risk group.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We calculated the population-attributable risk (PAR) by
comparing incidence and mortality of total and major individual carcinomas between the low-
and high-risk groups. We further assessed the PAR at the national scale by comparing the
low-risk group with the US population.
RESULTS A total of 89 571 women and 46 339 men from 2 cohorts were included in the study:
16 531 women and 11 731 men had a healthy lifestyle pattern (low-risk group), and the
remaining 73 040 women and 34 608 men made up the high-risk group. Within the 2
cohorts, the PARs for incidence and mortality of total carcinoma were 25% and 48% in
women, and 33% and 44% in men, respectively. For individual cancers, the respective PARs
in women and men were 82% and 78% for lung, 29% and 20% for colon and rectum, 30%
and 29% for pancreas, and 36% and 44% for bladder. Similar estimates were obtained for
mortality. The PARs were 4% and 12% for breast cancer incidence and mortality, and 21% for
fatal prostate cancer. Substantially higher PARs were obtained when the low-risk group was
compared with the US population. For example, the PARs in women and men were 41% and
63% for incidence of total carcinoma, and 60% and 59% for colorectal cancer, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A substantial cancer burden may be prevented through
lifestyle modification. Primary prevention should remain a priority for cancer control.

C
ancer is the second leading cause of death in the United
States, with 1.6 million new cancer cases and 0.6 mil-
lion cancer deaths projected to occur in 2016.1 The can-
cer mortality rate, age-standardized to the 2000 US standard
population, decreased from 199 to 163 per 100 000 between
1969 and 2013.2 However, this decline (17.9%) has been mod-
est compared with the dramatic decrease in heart disease mor-
tality (67.5%) during the same period, highlighting the need
for further efforts in cancer prevention and treatment.
Epidemiologic studies have established several lifestyle
factors that increase cancer risk, such as smoking, alcohol use,
obesity,andphysicalinactivity.3However,thissubstantialbody
of knowledge has been challenged by a recent study,4 which
found a high correlation between the number of stem cell di-
visions of a given tissue and the lifetime risk of cancer in that
tissue.Thisfindingledsometoconcludethatonlyathirdofthe

mental factors or inherited predispositions, while most is due

bad luck. This study has been widely covered by the press and
has created confusion for the public regarding the preventabil-
ity of cancer. Many arguments against the bad luck hypothesis
havebeenmade,5-12includingthenotionthatexternalenviron-
mentalfactorsmayinfluencecancerdevelopmentthroughpro-
motionofDNAdamage13;yetnoneofthesereportshasprovided
original data to assess the preventability of cancer through
modification of extrinsic factors.
Therefore,weestimatedthecontributionsofcommonlife-
style factors to cancer burden by comparing cancer incidence
and mortality between the participants who had a healthy life-
style (low-risk group) and those who did not (high-risk group)
in 2 nationwide cohorts. We further explored the potential ca-
pability of lifestyle modification for cancer prevention at the
national scale by comparing the low-risk subgroup of our co-
horts with the US population. Because our cohorts’partici-
pants were predominantly whites, to avoid any influence of
different racial distributions on the comparison with the
general population, we only included whites in the analysis.
Methods
Study Population
The Nurses’Health Study (NHS)14 and Health Professionals
Follow-up Study (HPFS)15 are 2 ongoing US cohorts that
respectively enrolled 121 700 registered female nurses aged
30 to 55 years with about 70% response rate in 1976 and
51 529 male health professionals aged 40 to 75 years with
about 25% response rate in 1986. Similar follow-up proce-
dures have been used in the 2 cohorts.14,16 In brief, partici-
pants completed a detailed questionnaire about their medi-
cal history and lifestyle at baseline and every 2 years
thereafter. Dietary intake was assessed using validated food
frequency questionnaires every 4 years. The response rates
have been 95.4% in the NHS and 95.9% in the HPFS for each
of the questionnaires though 2010. In the present study, we
used as baseline 1980 for the NHS and 1986 for the HPFS,
when we first collected detailed lifestyle data.
We identified 16 531 women from the NHS and 11 731 men
from the HPFS who met the 4 healthy lifestyle criteria for the
low-risk group: (1) never smoking or past smoking (pack-
years <5); (2) no or moderate alcohol drinking (≤1 drink/d for
women, ≤2 drinks/d for men), as recommended by the
Dietary Guidelines for Americans17; (3) BMI of at least 18.5 and
lower than 27.5; and (4) weekly aerobic physical activity of at
least 75 vigorous-intensity or 150 moderate-intensity min-
utes (7.5 metabolic-equivalent [METs] hours per week), as rec-
ommended by the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for
Americans.18,19 The remaining 73 040 women and 34 608 men
who did not meet all the 4 criteria and had complete lifestyle
data were classified into the high-risk group (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement). This study was approved by the institutional re-
viewboardatBrighamandWomen’
sHospitalandHarvardT.H.
Chan School of Public Health. Written informed consent was
obtained from all study participants.
Lifestyle Assessment
Height, body weight, smoking, and physical activity were self-
reported on biennial questionnaires. Physical activity was cal-
culated by summing the products of time spent on a variety
of leisure-time activities with the average MET for that
activity.20 Alcohol use was self-reported every 4 years on the
food frequency questionnaires.21 We calculated the overall di-
etary score according to the Alternate Healthy Eating Index,22
which is designed to target food choices and macronutrient
sources associated with reduced chronic disease risk.
Detailed sources of US lifestyle data are provided in the
eMethods in the Supplement.
Outcome Ascertainment
The primary outcomes of this study were incidence and mor-
tality of total and major individual carcinomas. For total car-
cinoma, we excluded from all cancers those in the skin, brain,
lymphatic, and hematopoietic tissues because these cancers
likely have other strong environmental causes than the ones
considered in the current study, such as UV exposure, infec-
tions, irradiation, and exposures to carcinogenic substances.
The total carcinomas we studied account for about 90% of all
cancer deaths among the US white population. For individual
carcinomas, we included those with at least 10 cases occur-
ring in our low-risk subpopulation. Given the concern about
Key Points
Question How many cancer cases and deaths in the United States
can be attributed to lifestyle factors?
Findings In this cohort study of a portion of the US white
population, about 20% to 40% of cancer cases and about half of
cancer deaths can be potentially prevented through lifestyle
modification. These figures increased to 40% to 70% when
assessed with regard to the population of US whites, and the
observations are potentially applicable to broader segments of the
US population.
Meaning Primary prevention should remain a priority for cancer
control.

overdiagnosis for indolent prostate cancer by prostate-
specific antigen (PSA) screening,23 we included only fatal pros-
tate cancer in our analysis. The number of cases for each
cancer is provided in eTable 1 in the Supplement.
Inbothcohorts,self-reporteddiagnosesofcancerwereob-
tained on biennial questionnaires, and participants who re-
ported a cancer diagnosis were asked for permission to ac-
quire their medical records and pathologic reports. Study
physicians, blinded to exposure information, reviewed medi-
calrecordstoconfirmcancerdiagnosis.Mostofthedeathswere
identified through family members or the postal system in re-
sponse to the follow-up questionnaires. We also searched the
names of persistent nonresponders in the National Death In-
dex. More than 96% of deaths have been identified using these
methods.24 The cause of death was assigned by study physi-
cians blinded to exposure data.
National Incidence and Mortality Data
We obtained the US cancer incidence25 and mortality26 data
from the National Cancer Institute’
s Surveillance, Epidemi-
ology, and End Results (SEER) Program. To parallel the age
distribution and follow-up time of our cohorts, we selected
data collected from participants 40 years or older, and from
1976 through 2012 for women and from 1986 through 2012
for men. For cancer mortality, the follow-up data were avail-
able up to 2011. We included only white participants, as we
did in our cohort population. All incidence and death rates
were age-standardized to the 2000 US standard population
using the National Cancer Institute’
s SEER*Stat software
(version 8.1.5).27
Statistical Analysis
Inourcohorts,wecalculatedperson-yearsoffollow-upforeach
participant from the age at the date of returning the baseline
questionnaire until the age at the date of death, loss to follow-
up, or end of follow-up (June 1, 2012, for the NHS; January 31,
2012, for the HPFS), whichever came first. For cancer inci-
dence analysis, follow-up was also censored when a partici-
pant was diagnosed with any of the cancers under study. Age-
and sex-specific rates were calculated for each of the 10 age
groups (<45, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79,
80-84, and ≥85 years) and then standardized to the 2000 US
standard population.
Our primary outcome measure was the population-
attributablerisk(PAR,%),whichincluded2sets:onewasbased
on comparison within our cohorts and calculated as the dif-
ference in the cancer rates between the low- and high-risk
groups divided by the rate in the high-risk group; and the other
onewasestimatedbycomparingthecancerincidenceandmor-
tality in our low-risk group with the national SEER rates. The
PAR can be interpreted as the proportion of cases that would
not occur if all individuals adopted the lifestyle of the low-
risk population. Details about derivation of the 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs) for PAR are provided in the eMethods in
the Supplement.
Results
Table 1 lists the comparison of major lifestyle factors in low-
and high-risk groups of our cohorts and the broader white US
population. Although diet was not a specific criterion, our low-
risk group had a higher Alternate Healthy Eating Index score
than our high-risk group. The lifestyle profile in the white US
population was generally even worse than that in our high-
risk group.
Table 2 lists the age-standardized incidence and mortal-
ity rates and the corresponding PAR estimates for total car-
cinomas among the 2 risk groups of our cohorts and the
whites in the US population. The incidence rates of total
carcinoma per 100 000 population in the low- vs high-risk
groups were 463 vs 618 in women, and 283 vs 425 in men,
giving rise to a PAR of 25% (95% CI, 21%-29%) in women
and 33% (95% CI, 28%-38%) in men. A higher PAR
was observed for mortality (48% [95% CI, 44%-53%] in
women and 44% [95% CI, 39%-48%] in men). When further

we obtained a substantially higher PAR: 41% in women and
63% in men for incidence, and 59% in women and 67% in
men for mortality.

Within our cohorts, the PARs for incident cancers in women

and 44% for bladder, 36% and 4% for kidney, 16% and 38% for

66% for esophagus. The PARs were 4% for breast cancer and
21% for endometrial, ovarian and fatal prostate cancer. A gen-
erally similar PAR was observed for cancer deaths except for
a dramatic increase for some sites, including breast (12%), en-
dometrium (49%), kidney in men (48%), and oral cavity and
pharynx (75% in women and 57% in men).

Discussion
In the 2 cohort studies of US white individuals, we found that
overall, 20% to 40% of carcinoma cases and about half of car-
cinoma deaths can be potentially prevented through lifestyle
modification. Not surprisingly, these figures increased to 40%
to 70% when assessed with regard to the broader US popula-
tion of whites, which has a much worse lifestyle pattern than
our cohorts. Notably, approximately 80% to 90% of lung can-
cer deaths could be avoided if Americans adopted the life-
style of the low-risk group, mainly by quitting smoking. For
other cancers, from 10% to 70% of deaths could be pre-
vented. These results provide strong support for the impor-
tance of environmental factors in cancer risk and reinforce the
enormous potential of primary prevention for cancer control.
The 4 factors considered in the current study are among
the most prevalent lifestyle factors convincingly linked to vari-
ous cancers. Smoking contributed to 48.5% of deaths from the
12 smoking-related cancers in the United States.28 Heavy al-
cohol consumption has been causally related to increased risk
of cancers in several sites, including colorectum, breast, oral
cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, and liver; and possibly to
a higher risk of cancers of the lung, pancreas, stomach, and
gallbladder.29 Obesity increases risk of cancers in the esopha-
gus (adenocarcinoma), colorectum, pancreas, breast (after
menopause), endometrium, kidney, and liver; and probably
increases risk of cancers in the ovaries, prostate (advanced
only), and gallbladder.3 In contrast, physical activity has been
linked to lower risk of cancers in the colorectum, breast, and
endometrium.3
These compelling data together with the findings of the
current study provide strong support for the argument that
a large proportion of cancers are due to environmental fac-
tors and can be prevented by lifestyle modification.12
Although the stochastic effects of DNA replication error may
contribute to the variation in cancer incidence across differ-
ent tissues,4 these influences would be unlikely to explain
the wide variation in cancer rates within tissues that have
similar lifetime numbers of stem cell divisions or between
individuals with different exposure profiles, or the rapidly
increasing burden of cancer in low- and middle-income
countries accompanying the global shifts in lifestyle and
environmental exposures.8,30,31
Several previous studies have attempted to quantify the
contribution of environmental factors to cancer risk, with
the estimated PAR ranging from 30% to 50%.32-34 A classic
approach was often undertaken using the population preva-
lence of exposure and the relative risk estimate derived
from the literature for each risk factor.35 Therefore, several
factors can contribute to the variation in PAR estimates,
including differences in environmental factors considered
in each study, varied definitions and prevalence of expo-
sures, and different sources used to derive the relative risk
estimates.

In contrast, our study used the more straightforward ap-
proach of direct comparison of cancer rates between partici-
pants with distinct lifestyle profiles. This approach relies on
detailed lifestyle and cancer follow-up data from 2 nation-
wide cohort studies and circumvents the need for derivation
of relative risk estimates for each individual risk factor asso-
ciated with each cancer. It also takes account of the joint con-
tributions of multiple risk factors that are often difficult, if not
impossible, to estimate by the classic approach owing to un-
certainties about the interactions and complex relationships
amongriskfactors.36Thisapproachbasedondirectratherthan
deriveddataissimilartothatusedbyDollandPeto,37whocom-
pared US death rates with the lowest reliably observed death
rates in other populations and estimated that about 75%
of US cancer deaths could be attributed to lifestyle and other
environmental factors.
Our results are also consistent with a recent study show-
ing that cell division–related intrinsic risk factors alone in the
absence of environmental risk factors do not confer substan-
tial cancer risk.12 Through mathematical modeling, that study
demonstrates that accumulation of endogenous stem-cell mu-
tation errors, estimated by assuming widely different muta-
tion rates, is not sufficient to account for the observed cancer
risk.12 Taken together with our current empirical data, the 2
studies provide complementary evidence for the predomi-
nant role of extrinsic environmental factors in cancer risk.
However, it should be noted that we selected the 4 major
lifestyle cancer risk factors for characterization of the low-
risk group to show the preventable potential of cancer rather
than to conclude causally that these were the only factors rel-
evant to cancer risk. Therefore, the PARs that we calculated
might include contributions from other behaviors that are
closely related to the 4 specified lifestyle factors and that are
also important determinants for cancer risk (eg, diet).
Moreover, we used a less stringent threshold for charac-
terization of the low-risk profile to allow for a meaningful

analysis for some less common cancers. For example, the up-
per limit for BMI was set at 27.5 rather than 25, as commonly
used to define normal body weight. Thus, the potential pre-
ventability of cancer that can be achieved by primary preven-
tion may be even higher than our estimates, especially con-
sidering other factors in the wider population, including
occupational exposures, infectious agents, certain behaviors
(eg, postmenopausal estrogen use), additional dietary fac-
tors, and early-life exposures.38,39
It may be argued that the health professional back-
grounds of the participants in our cohorts, especially those in
the low-risk group, make them more health conscious and give
themeasieraccesstocancerscreeningandbettertreatmentop-
tions than would be true in the general population; therefore,
our PARs may have been overestimated. However, we did not
find substantial difference between the 2 risk groups of our co-
horts in the uptake of screening. For breast cancer, the rate of
mammographic screening within the past 2 years, standard-
izedtothe2000USpopulation,was78%inthehigh-riskgroup
and 83% in the low-risk group in 2010. For colorectal cancer,
the age-standardized rates in 2010 of ever having lower endo-
scopic screening in the high-risk and low-risk groups were 63%
and 70% in women, and 68% and 75% in men, respectively. Al-
though direct comparison with the US data are difficult be-
cause of the differences in assessment methods and time
frames, these estimates are generally consistent with the over-
all US screening uptake,40,41 suggesting that screening is
unlikely to have a substantial influence on our PAR estimates.
With regard to participants’health professional status po-
tentially conferring access to better cancer therapy, the similar
PAR estimates for cancer mortality (67%) and incidence (61%)
in men argues against a strong influence of better therapy in
our low-risk group relative to the general population—the
reduction in cancer mortality was largely due to a reduction in
incidence. In women, the PAR for mortality (59%) was
substantially higher than for incidence (41%). Two main

factors may have contributed to this difference. First, smoking
has a predominant effect that results in a much higher PAR for
incident lung cancer than for breast cancer (85% vs 15%). Yet,
despite its low incidence in women, lung cancer is much more
fatalthanbreastcancer,thuscontributingrelativelymoretothe
PAR for mortality than for incidence. Indeed, after excluding
lungandbreastcancersfromtotalcarcinoma,weobtainedsimi-
lar PARs for incidence and mortality in women (50% vs 48%).
Second, the PAR for breast cancer was much higher for mortal-
ity (45%) than for incidence (15%), partly because mammo-
graphicscreeningactuallyincreasescancerincidenceduetode-
tection of early or indolent cancer.42 In addition, some risk
factors, such as obesity and physical inactivity, may influence
survival by causing more aggressive cancers, increasing can-
cer progression, or making cancer more difficult to diagnose
earlyandtreat.43-45Furthermore,thelifestyleriskfactorslower
incidence of comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and
diabetes, which may affect cancer prognosis directly or indi-
rectly (eg, by limiting aggressive therapy).46
Finally, we only included whites in our PAR estimates,
which may not be generalizable to other ethnic groups. How-
ever, all of the considered factors have been established as risk
factors in diverse ethnic groups, although there could be
differences in the magnitudes of the associations.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we found that a substantial proportion of
cancer cases and even more deaths among US white indi-
viduals might be prevented by quitting smoking, avoiding
heavy alcohol consumption, maintaining a BMI between
18.5 and 27.5, and exercising at a moderate intensity for at
least 150 minutes or at a vigorous intensity for at least 75
minutes every week. These findings reinforce the predomi-
nant importance of lifestyle factors in determining cancer
risk. Therefore, primary prevention should remain a priority
for cancer control.
