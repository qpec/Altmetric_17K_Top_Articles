Background-—Smoke-free legislation has been associated with reductions in secondhand smoke exposure and cardiovascular
disease. However, it remains unknown whether smoke-free policies are associated with reductions in blood pressure (BP).
Methods and Results-—Longitudinal data from 2606 nonsmoking adult participants of the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk
Development in Young Adults) Study (1995–2011) were linked to state, county, and local-level 100% smoke-free policies in bars,
restaurants, and/or nonhospitality workplaces based on participants’ census tract of residence. Mixed-effects models estimated
associations of policies with BP and hypertension trajectories over 15 years of follow-up. Fixed-effects regression estimated
associations of smoke-free policies with within-person changes in systolic and diastolic BP and hypertension. Models were
adjusted for sociodemographic, health-related, and policy/geographic covariates. Smoke-free policies were associated with
between-person differences and within-person changes in systolic BP. Participants living in areas with smoke-free policies had
lower systolic BP on average at the end of follow-up compared with those in areas without policies (adjusted predicted mean
differences [in mm Hg]: restaurant: �1.14 [95% confidence interval: �2.15, �0.12]; bar: �1.52 [�2.48, �0.57]; workplace:
�1.41 [�2.32, �0.50]). Smoke-free policies in restaurants and bars were associated with mean within-person reductions in
systolic BP of �0.85 (�1.61, �0.09) and �1.08 (�1.82, �0.34), respectively. Only restaurant policies were associated with a
significant within-person reduction in diastolic BP, of �0.58 (�1.15, �0.01).
Conclusions-—While the magnitude of associations was small at the individual level, results suggest a potential mechanism
through which reductions in secondhand smoke because of smoke-free policies may improve population-level cardiovascular
health. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e009829. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.118.009829.)

obacco smoke exposure results in nearly 100 000
deaths per year in the United States because of
coronary heart disease.1 Many cities, states, and countries
have passed legislation banning smoking in public places
including restaurants, bars, and workplaces in an effort to
minimize
population-level
exposure
to
tobacco
smoke.
Smoke-free policies are intended to decrease secondhand
smoke (SHS) exposure and encourage current smokers to quit
or reduce the amount they smoke. Systematic reviews
indicate that smoke-free legislation is associated with reduc-
tions in SHS.2 Results for smoking are somewhat less
conclusive, although many studies have found smoke-free
policies to be associated with reduced smoking prevalence
and intensity.2
Compared with other smoking-related diseases such as
lung cancer, the risk that cigarette smoking and SHS
exposure imparts on cardiovascular health is relatively
transient, as is evidenced by the rapid decline in risk of a
recurrent heart attack after quitting smoking.3 Prior ecologic
studies have shown smoke-free laws, in a short timeframe, to
be associated with reductions in hospital admissions for
cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially acute myocardial
infarction.2,4–6 As high blood pressure (BP) significantly
increases the risk of coronary heart disease, including

 myocardial infarction,7 and SHS exposure has been linked to
hypertension across a variety of settings,8–12 BP changes are
one potential mechanism through which smoke-free policies
may reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in
nonsmokers. Although the association of smoke-free policies
on BP would be expected to be small at the level of the
individual, even small reductions in BP may meaningfully
reduce cardiovascular risk at the population level.13 However,
little is known regarding whether smoke-free policies are
associated with reductions in BP in nonsmokers. As such, our
objective was to evaluate associations of smoke-free policies
in restaurants, bars, and workplaces with changes in BP and
hypertension among a large, geographically diverse cohort of
nonsmoking adults.

The CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young
Adults) study is a longitudinal, multicenter cohort study that
enrolled 5115 black and white adults aged 18 to 30 years old
in 1985 to 1986 from 4 US cities: Birmingham, Alabama;
Chicago, Illinois, Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Oakland, Cal-
ifornia.14 Follow-up examinations were conducted after 2, 5,
7, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 years (retention rates of 91%, 86%,
81%, 79%, 74%, 72%, 72%, and 71% among the surviving
cohort). The Institutional Review Board at each participating
institution approved the study and all participants provided
written informed consent. Participant home addresses were
geocoded in years 0, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 25. We included years
10 to 25 (1995–2011) in this analysis in order to align with
the timing of smoke-free policies. We excluded participants
who did not have at least 2 BP measurements during follow-
up (493 participants, 9.5%). Also, in order to focus on the
potential for smoke-free policies to influence BP through
reductions in SHS, we restricted to participants who reported
not actively smoking (defined as smoking at least 5 cigarettes
per week for the past 3 months) at any of the year 10, 15, 20,
and 25 examinations (N=2606 participants).
Smoke-Free Policies
Smoke-free laws were extracted from the American Non-
Smokers’ Rights Foundation’s Local Ordinance Database,15
which compiled dates of all state, county, and city-level laws
that prohibited smoking in restaurants, bars, or nonhospitality
workplaces. Smoke-free policies from the American Non-
Smokers’ Rights Foundation database were linked to CARDIA
participants at each examination based on the census tract
they lived in. Participant addresses were converted to state-
county-census tract Federal Information Processing Standard
codes. State and county Federal Information Processing
Standard codes were used to determine whether each census
tract was located in a state or county covered by a smoke-free
policy in restaurants, bars, and/or workplaces. Then, census
tracts were converted to census place names (approximately
equivalent to city boundaries) using the Missouri Census Data
Center’s
MABLE/Geocorr
Geographic
Correspondence
Engine16 in order to determine whether each tract was
located in a municipality with local smoke-free policies.
Policies were linked back to participants at each examination
based on their census tract and examination date. Partici-
pants were considered exposed if they had a smoke-free
policy in a given venue (restaurant, bar, workplace) at either
the state, county, or local level. Policies were treated as time-
varying variables in all models, and smoke-free policy
exposure was successfully linked for all participants at each
examination.
Outcomes
Systolic and diastolic BP (SBP, DBP) were measured at each
examination. Trained technicians used a random-zero mercury
sphygmomanometer (years 10–15) or an oscillometer (years
20–25) to measure brachial artery BP. Resting SBP and DBP
were measured 3 times at 1-minute intervals after the
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Smoke-free policies are associated with reduced rates of
hospitalization for cardiovascular disease, but prior studies
have not examined associations with blood pressure
changes.
• We linked longitudinal data from the CARDIA (Coronary
Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) Study to state,
county, and local smoke-free policies in restaurants, bars,
and workplaces to examine associations with BP.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Smoke-free policies were associated with small but signif-
icant between-person differences and within-person reduc-
tions in systolic blood pressure.
• While the magnitude of associations was small on an
individual level, systolic blood pressure reduction is a
potential mechanism through which smoke-free policies
may reduce cardiovascular risk at the population level.

 participant had sat in a quiet room for 5 minutes, and the
mean of the second and third measurements were calculated.
Details on BP measurement and quality control have been
published previously.17 In order to account for changes in
observed BP because of treatment with BP medications, we
added 10 mm Hg to the observed SBP and 5 mm Hg to the
observed DBP in patients reporting BP medication use.18 In a
sensitivity analysis, we used the original BP values and
adjusted for whether or not participants reported BP medi-
cation use. Hypertension was defined at each examination as
SBP≥130 mm Hg,
DBP≥80 mm Hg,
or
self-reported
BP
medication use.
Covariates
Participant age, sex, and race were recorded at baseline. All
other covariates were time-varying and were assessed at each
examination. Educational attainment (in years), current mar-
ital status (married/cohabitating versus not), and alcohol
consumption (heavy versus not heavy) were ascertained via
standardized questionnaires. Alcohol use was dichotomized
as heavy (>7 alcoholic beverages per week for women and
>14 for men) versus not heavy based on the recommended
consumption in the American College of Cardiology/American
Heart Association’s 2017 Hypertension Guidelines.19 House-
hold income was collected as a 9-level ordinal variable,
converted to a continuous variable using the average dollar
value for each category, and adjusted for inflation using the
Consumer
Price
Index.20
Depressive
symptoms
were
assessed using the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Stud-
ies-Depression questionnaire.21 Participants were considered
to have depressive symptoms if their score was greater than
or equal to the validated cut point for clinical depression of 16
(on a scale of 0–60).22
Physical activity was assessed at each examination using a
validated questionnaire assessing frequency of participation
in 13 categories of exercise during the past 12 months.23 A
total physical activity score was calculated by multiplying
frequency of participation by intensity of the activity and
summing across activities to create a continuous exercise unit
score. Participant height and weight were measured in the
clinic at each examination, and body mass index was
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared. Diabetes mellitus was defined using the following
criteria: fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, 2-hour glucose toler-
ance test ≥200 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5%, or self-
reported use of diabetes mellitus medication.
Dietary quality was assessed at the year 7 and year 20
examinations using the CARDIA dietary history,24 which
ascertained usual dietary practices and food frequency over
the past month. A Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
(DASH) diet score was calculated based on the 8 components
of DASH (increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole
grains, nuts and legumes, and low-fat dairy products; and
reduced consumption of sodium, sugar-sweetened beverages,
and red and processed meats).25 For each component,
participants were classified into sex-specific quintiles accord-
ing to their intake. Quintiles were assigned scores from 1
(worst) to 5 (best) for each component, and then summed to
create a summary DASH diet score ranging from 8 to 40, with
higher scores reflecting better diet. The year 7 value was used
for examinations 10 and 15, and the year 20 value was used
for years 20 and 25. Fast-food habits were assessed at each
examination using the question: “How often do you eat
breakfast, lunch, or dinner at places such as McDonald’s,
Burger King, Wendy’s, Arby’s, Pizza Hut, or Kentucky Fried
Chicken?”
Participants who worked outside the home in an indoor
setting were asked to report whether their workplace had a
policy banning smoking (either partially or completely). We
compared those with a self-reported total workplace ban to
all others in order to account for workplaces that had
voluntarily banned smoking without laws mandating them to
do so. At each examination, participants self-reported the
average number of hours per week that they were exposed to
tobacco smoke because of smoking by others in their home,
in small spaces other than their home (eg, office, car) or large
indoor spaces other than their home (eg, restaurant, hotel
lobby). State cigarette taxes from The Tax Burden on
Tobacco26 were adjusted for inflation using the Consumer
Price Index20 and linked to participants at each examination.
Metropolitan statistical area–level percent of the population
below the US Census Bureau–defined poverty threshold was
calculated at each examination to account for socioeconomic
differences that might be associated with smoke-free policy
implementation. Finally, state of residence was included as a
covariate to account for additional unmeasured area-level
differences in BP.
Statistical Analysis
We conducted multiple imputation using chained equations27
to impute missing covariate values (percent missing ranged
from 0% to 8.8% across variables) (Data S1). To examine
associations of smoke-free policies with BP and hypertension,
we used 2 analytic strategies: mixed-effects and fixed-effects
models. We used mixed-effects models to examine between-
person differences in BP and hypertension trajectories
associated with smoke-free policies and to calculate average
between-person differences at each examination. Fixed-
effects modeling was used to examine associations of
smoke-free policies with within-person changes in BP. Fixed-
effects models include only within-person variation when
estimating associations and treat each individual as his/her

 own control. This process inherently controls for all time-
invariant characteristics, both measured and unmeasured, by
conditioning these characteristics out of the estimation
process.28 This is advantageous as fixed-effects models
provide improved control for residual confounding by unmea-
sured variables that are stable over time. However, fixed-
effects models may lead to wide confidence intervals (CIs)
because between-person differences are discarded. In both
sets of models, we calculated robust standard errors using
Stata’s vce(robust) option (Stata version 15.1; StataCorp,
College Station, TX).
We first used mixed-effects models (linear regression for
SBP and DBP, logistic regression for hypertension) with
subject random intercepts in order to account for the
correlation of repeated measures within subjects. We ran
separate models for each type of policy (restaurant, bar,
workplace) because the policies were highly correlated
(r=0.70–0.87).
Models
included
time-varying
smoke-free
policy exposure status, time since baseline in 5-year intervals
(treated as continuous for SBP models because of an
approximately linear relationship with time, and as dummy
variables for DBP and hypertension models because of
substantial departures from linearity; Figure S1), and a
cross-product interaction between policy status and time.
Models were adjusted for baseline age, sex, race, and the
following time-varying covariates: education, marital status,
income, body mass index, physical activity, alcohol consump-
tion, dietary quality, fast-food consumption, diabetes mellitus,
depressive symptoms, state of residence, state cigarette tax,
metropolitan statistical area–level poverty, and self-reported
workplace smoking prohibition (workplace policy models
only). All continuous variables were centered at the mean.
We presented the mixed-effects model findings as adjusted
predicted average BP values and predicted probability of
hypertension at each examination among participants who
were and were not living in areas with smoke-free policies at
that examination. Differences in average BP values and
difference in predicted probability of hypertension between
participants living in areas with and without smoke-free
policies at each examination were calculated, along with 95%
CIs.
We then used fixed-effects models to estimate associa-
tions of smoke-free policies with within-person changes in
BP (linear regression) and within-person changes in the odds
of hypertension (logistic regression). As time-invariant char-
acteristics are conditioned out of the model, we adjusted
only for the time-varying covariates listed above in order to
control for confounding by changes in these characteristics
over time. As above, time was modeled as a continuous
variable for SBP and as dummy variables for DBP and
hypertension. Additionally, in a supplemental analysis, we
examined the potential mediating role of self-reported SHS
exposure. We used fixed-effects models to examine associ-
ations of (1) smoke-free policies with change in self-reported
SHS exposure; (2) change in self-reported SHS exposure with
change in SBP and DBP; and (3) smoke-free policies with
change in SBP and DBP after adjusting for self-reported SHS
exposure.
As a sensitivity analysis, we used methods described by
VanderWeele and Ding29 to calculate the e-value, or the
amount of residual confounding because of an omitted
covariate that would be needed to shift the magnitude of
association between smoke-free policies and BP to the null.
Details of this sensitivity analysis are presented in Data S2.

Results
A total of 2606 CARDIA participants were included in the
analysis. Among the whole sample, SBP increased from 109.7
to
121.0 mm Hg,
and
DBP
increased
from
72.5
to
75.2 mm Hg (Table 1). The percent of participants with
hypertension increased from 22.6% to 44.4%.
At baseline (year 10 examination), 1.5% of participants
lived in areas with smoke-free policies in restaurants, 0.8%
in bars, and 7.3% in workplaces (Figure 1). Smoke-free
policy exposure increased substantially over follow-up, and
by year 25, 88% of participants lived in areas with smoke-
free policies in restaurants, 75% in bars, and 73% in
workplaces (Figure 1). Participants had dispersed geograph-
ically from the 4 original study centers by the year 10
examination and lived in 46 different states. Table S1
presents the proportion of participants covered by smoke-
free policies passed at each geographic level (state, county,
and local).
At each examination, participants living in areas with
restaurant policies had lower SBP on average than those in
areas
without
restaurant
policies,
and
the
difference
increased over time (Figure 2A). By the year 25 examination,
participants in areas with restaurant policies had SBP values
on average 1.14 mm Hg lower than those in areas without
restaurant policies (95% CI, �2.15, �0.12). Patterns were
similar for bar policies, with a slightly larger difference by year
25 (difference of �1.52 mm Hg, 95% CI, �2.48, �0.57). For
workplace policies, participants living in areas with policies
had slightly higher SBP in years 10 and 15, which reversed in
years 20 and 25 (final difference in year 25 of �1.41 mm Hg,
95% CI, �2.32, �0.50). Table S2 presents the regression
coefficients from the mixed-effects models that were used to
calculate the predicted values. For all 3 types of policies, the
slope of the SBP curve increased at a slower rate among
those exposed to smoke-free policies (5-year differences of

action: 0.3 for restaurant policies, 0.08 for bar policies, and
0.002 for workplace policies).
For DBP and hypertension, patterns were less clear.
Participants living in areas with smoke-free policies had
higher DBP on average in year 10, lower in years 15 and 20,
and higher again in year 25 compared with those living in

 areas without smoke-free policies (Figure 3A through 3C,
Table S3). A higher proportion of participants living in areas
with smoke-free policies in year 10 had prevalent hyperten-
sion compared with those in areas without smoke-free
policies, but there was no difference in the predicted
probability of hypertension between those living in areas
with and without smoke-free policies in later years (Fig-
ure 4A through 4C, Table S4). Results for both SBP and DBP
were similar in sensitivity analyses that accounted for BP
medication use by using the original recorded BP values and
adjusting for BP medication use in the model (Tables S5
through S6).
Table 2 presents the results of the fixed-effects models,
which estimated the average change in SBP and DBP, and
average change in the odds of hypertension, associated
with becoming exposed to a smoke-free policy in restau-
rants, bars, or workplaces. Living in an area with a
restaurant smoke-free policy was associated with a mean
SBP change of �0.85 mm Hg (95% CI, �1.61, �0.09) after
controlling for time and time-varying sociodemographic,
clinical, and policy/geographic covariates (Table 2). Associ-
ations were slightly stronger for bar policies (�1.08, 95%
CI, �1.82, �0.34) and weaker for workplace policies with a
CI crossing the null (�0.60, 95% CI, �1.33, 0.14). For DBP,
patterns differed. Restaurant policies were associated with
a reduction in DBP of �0.58 (95% CI, �1.15, �0.01), while
point estimates were in the opposite direction and CIs
overlapped the null for bar and workplace policies (esti-
mated mean change of 0.26, 95% CI, �0.32, 0.83 for bar
policies and 0.22, 95% CI, �0.37, 0.80 for workplace
policies). Results were similar in models that used the
original BP values and adjusted for BP medication use
(Table S7). For hypertension, point estimates were in the
hypothesized
direction
but
CIs
were
wide
(restaurant
policies: odds ratio: 0.93, 95% CI, 0.71, 1.23; bar policies:
odds ratio: 0.82, 95% CI, 0.61, 1.10; workplace policies:
odds ratio: 0.91, 95% CI, 0.68, 1.20; Table 2).
In a supplemental analysis, we found smoke-free policies in
restaurants and bars to be associated with within-person
reductions in average hours/wk of SHS exposure in large
indoor spaces (Table S8). Smoke-free policies were not
associated with changes in SHS exposure in the home.
Changes in self-reported SHS exposure were not associated
with changes in SBP or DBP, and associations between
smoke-free policies and blood pressure were unchanged upon
adjustment for self-reported SHS exposure (Table S8). In a
sensitivity analysis to assess the potential influence of
unmeasured confounding, we estimated that an unmeasured
confounder would need to have an association equivalent to a
relative risk of �1.3 to 1.4 with both the exposure and
outcome in order to shift the magnitude of the predicted
difference in SBP between participants living in areas with and
without smoke-free policies to the null. As this was estimated
from fully adjusted models, this strength of association would

Discussion
Smoke-free policies have been associated with reduced
risk of hospitalization for CVD,2,4–6 but prior studies have
not examined associations of these policies with BP
changes. Among a geographically diverse cohort of black
and white nonsmoking adults followed for 15 years, we
found that participants living in areas with smoke-free
policies in restaurants, bars, and workplaces had lower
SBP at the end of follow-up compared with participants
living in areas without smoke-free policies. In addition,
smoke-free policies in bars and restaurants were associ-
ated with within-person reductions in SBP. For DBP and
hypertension, patterns were inconsistent and CIs were
generally wide.
Smoke-free policies have been shown to reduce environ-
mental
tobacco
smoke
exposure
among
hospitality
workers30–33
and
the
general
population.34
Smoke-free
policies have also been associated with reductions in
hospital admissions for CVD, particularly for acute myocardial
infarction.2,4–6 We previously found smoke-free policies to be
associated with reduced risk of incident CVD in CARDIA.35
Although not all studies have found associations between
smoke-free policies and CVD,36,37 systematic reviews have
concluded the evidence is strong.2 While no prior studies
have examined associations of smoke-free policies with
changes to BP, our results are consistent in the context of
prior findings for SHS and CVD. High BP significantly
increases the risk of coronary heart disease7 and SHS
exposure has been linked to hypertension,8–12 likely because
of adverse effects of harmful components of SHS (nicotine,
carbon monoxide, methane, formaldehyde, and others) on
vasoconstriction
or
vasodilation,38

 as a potential mechanism through which smoke-free policies
may reduce rates of CVD at the population level.
We found smoke-free policies to be consistently associ-
ated with reduced SBP, but not DBP or hypertension. SBP
elevation in isolation
is often
a result of age-related
atherosclerosis, and occurs more frequently than isolated
diastolic elevation after age 50.40 Recent work in CARDIA
indicated that SBP was more strongly associated with CVD
risk than DBP among participants in middle age,41 which
corresponds with the time period of our analysis. Increasing
BP values below the threshold for hypertension have been
found to be associated with worse CVD outcomes.7,42 In
addition, even small reductions in SBP may result in
meaningful reductions in CVD risk across a population—for
example, a study that estimated CVD incidence rates for a
hypothetical population-wide intervention estimated that a
1 mm Hg reduction was associated with �10 fewer coronary
heart disease events per 100 000 people per year.13 Thus,
changes to SBP of the magnitude seen in our study have
important implications for cardiovascular public health. For
hypertension, the use of a cruder dichotomous outcome
measure reflecting the same underlying process as SBP may
have limited statistical power to detect small associations.
Our finding that self-reported SHS was not associated with
changes in BP and did not appear to mediate associations of
smoke-free policies with SBP may reflect challenges in measur-
ing actual SHS exposure via a crude self-reported measure
(asking participants to report the number of hours per week on
average they were exposed). SHS exposure intensity may vary
significantlyfromplacetoplaceandatdifferenttimesoftheday.
In addition, the measures required participants not only to
recollect their exposure but also to synthesize this information
across avariety of possible venues. Finally,thesemeasures may
be overly broad to reflect exposures in the venues covered by
smoke-free policies (for example, SHS exposure in small indoor
spaces may include exposure in cars as well as workplaces).
Strengths of this study include use of data from a large,
geographically diverse cohort with 15 years of follow-up,

 and use of fixed-effects models to tightly control for both
measured and unmeasured time-invariant characteristics of
participants. However, this study was also subject to
several limitations. First, our results may be subject to
residual confounding. Although fixed-effects models provide
tight control for unmeasured confounding by time-invariant
characteristics, they do not control for unmeasured con-
founders that vary over time. For example, we were unable
to control for anti-smoking marketing campaigns because
no comprehensive database of these campaigns is avail-
able. Our sensitivity analysis using the e-value indicated an
unmeasured confounder with an association equivalent to a
risk ratio of 1.3 to 1.4 with both the exposure and outcome
might explain results. However, this level of association
would need to persist after adjustment for all of the
measured covariates that were included in our analysis,
which included the SBP time trend, state of residence,
metropolitan-level poverty, cigarette taxes, and individual-
level sociodemographics, health behaviors, and hyperten-
sion risk factors.
In addition, although CARDIA had high retention rates, it is
possible that loss to follow-up could bias results if loss to
follow-up is patterned by both smoke-free policy exposure
status and BP. Because BP values were measured by
technicians, it is possible that measured values were
elevated
relative
to
what
would
be
seen
in
24-hour
ambulatory BP monitoring because of “white coat hyperten-
sion.” However, prior work in CARDIA that compared in-clinic
to ambulatory BP measurements among a subset of partic-
ipants found the prevalence of white coat hypertension to be
small (3% for white and 4% for black participants).43 Also, we
restricted to participants who reported that they were never
regular smokers during the study period (defined as smoking
at least 5 cigarettes per week). However, we did not ask
participants whether they smoked at less frequent intervals,
so it is possible that some participants were occasional
smokers rather than true nonsmokers. Finally, smoke-free
policies were linked to participants based on their residence.
However, if participants worked or spent time in bars and
restaurants in different cities from their home, the policies
exposures attributed to them in this study may not reflect
their actual exposure.

 Conclusion
Smoke-free policies in bars, restaurants, and workplaces were
associated with significantly lower SBP at the end of follow-
up, and with small within-person reductions in SBP, among a
cohort of black and white US nonsmokers. Results underscore
the potential benefit at a population level of smoke-free
policies as a prevention measure for high SBP.

Supplemental Methods 1. Description of the Multiple Imputation Model. 
 
The multiple imputation model used to create the 10 imputed datasets used for analysis was fitted using 
the MI Impute Chained package in Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). This package 
uses chained equations, a method with fully conditional specification of prediction equations that allows 
for arbitrary missingness-value patterns that can accommodate multiple types of variables.1  
 
The analytic dataset was converted from a long format (up to 4 rows per participant reflecting the 4 
included exams, years 10, 15, 20, and 25) to a wide format. This was done following guidance for the 
imputation of longitudinal data2,3 in order to simultaneously include data from all exams, so that 
participants’ responses for a given variable from other exams as well as other variables could be used to 
impute missing. Following imputation, the dataset was converted back to a long (person-period) format 
and imputed variables from exams that participants did not actually attend were dropped.  
 
All analytic variables were included in the model as predictors (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood 
pressure, blood pressure medication use, baseline age, study center, state of residence, sex, race, 
education, income, marital status, alcohol use, body mass index, physical activity, fast food consumption, 
dietary quality, diabetes status, depressive symptoms, smoke-free policies, state cigarette taxes, 
secondhand smoke exposures in the home, small indoor spaces, and large indoor spaces. Logit models 
were used to predict dichotomous variables with missing data (marital status, alcohol use, depressive 
symptoms, diabetes) and predictive mean matching was used to impute continuous variables with 
missing data (education, income, body mass index, physical activity, dietary quality, fast food 
consumption, state cigarette tax, secondhand smoke exposure).

Supplemental Methods 2. Sensitivity to Omitted Variable Residual Confounding. 
 
We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential influence of an unmeasured confounder on 
the associations between smoke-free policies and systolic blood pressure (SBP) observed in this study. 
We focus this section on SBP since associations for diastolic blood pressure and prevalent hypertension 
were inconsistent and confidence intervals were generally wide. We calculated the e-value, as described 
by VanderWeele and Ding4, which quantifies the extent of residual confounding from an omitted covariate 
that would be required to shift associations between smoke-free policies and SBP to the null. While the e-
value is often used for risk ratios, extensions to other types of measures are available. We calculated 
Cohen’s d effect sizes using the predicted mean differences between participants living in areas with and 
without smoke-free policies in restaurants, bars, and workplaces in year 25, as well as the pooled 
standard deviation (SD) of SBP across the exposed and unexposed groups. We then used the formula 
published by VanderWeele and Ding4 to calculate the e-value based on standardized effect size. 
 
Steps:  
1) We calculated pooled standard errors for the exposed and unexposed groups:  
 
𝑆𝐷𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑑 = √(𝑆𝐷𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑑
2
+𝑆𝐷𝑢𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑑
2
2
) 
 
2) We calculated standardized effect size measure (Cohen’s d) using the mean difference between 
exposure groups and the pooled standard deviation, calculated as: 
 
d = (𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑑 − 𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑑)
𝑆𝐷𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑑
 
 
3) We converted the effect size into a risk ratio (RR) using the equation provided in Vanderwheele 
and Ding:   𝑅𝑅 = 𝑒(0.91∗𝑑) 
 
4) As the RR is <1, we used the formula:  𝑅𝑅∗ =
1
𝑅𝑅 
 
5) We then used RR* to calculate the e-value using the formula:  
𝑒 − 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 = 𝑅𝑅∗ + √𝑅𝑅∗ ∗ (𝑅𝑅∗ − 1) 
 
This was done for each type of smoke-free policy (restaurant, bar, workplace). The e-values, and the 
values used to calculate them, are shown below

The results suggest that a potential unmeasured confounder would be required to have an association 
equivalent to a relative risk between 1.3 and 1.4 with both the exposure and the outcome. Because we 
adjusted for the time trend in SBP, state of residence, state cigarette taxes, and individual-level 
sociodemographics, health behaviors, and other health risk factors, this degree of confounding would 
need to persist after these adjustments.

*Self-reported SHS exposure was ascertained at each exam by asking participants to report the average 
number of hours per week that they were exposed to tobacco smoke due to smoking by others in their 
home, in small spaces other than their home (e.g. office, car) or large indoor spaces other than their 
home (e.g. restaurant, hotel lobby). We examined associations of SHS in small spaces with workplace 
smoke-free policies, and SHS in large spaces with bar and restaurant smoke-free policies.  
†Participant exposure to smoke-free policies was defined as living in a census tract in a state, county, or 
locality that implemented a 100% ban on smoking in restaurants, bars, or workplaces.  
‡Statistical modeling was as follows: A) Results are from linear fixed-effects models and can be 
interpreted as the difference in hours per week of SHS exposure comparing years where participants 
lived in areas with smoke-free policies compared to years where they did not. B) Results are from linear 
fixed-effects models and can be interpreted as the mean difference in BP associated with a 1 hour per 
week increase in self-reported SHS exposure. C) Results are from linear fixed-effects models and can be 
interpreted as the mean difference in BP in years where participants lived in areas with smoke-free 
policies compared to years where they did not, controlling for SHS and other covariates.  
§All models were adjusted for time since baseline (5-year increments), time-varying covariates 
(education, marital status, income, body mass index, physical activity, alcohol use, diabetes, state 
cigarette tax, state of residence, metropolitan statistical area-level poverty, and whether participants 
reported that their workplace had a prohibition on smoking (workplace policy models only)), and in part C,  
self-reported secondhand smoke exposure in large (bar, restaurant) or small (workplace) indoor places 
outside the home, and interaction between time-invariant characteristics and time that were significant at 
the p<0.05 level (age*time and race*time for SBP, sex*time and race*time for DBP). 
||As longitudinal patterns of DBP were not well approximated by a linear relationship with follow-up time, 
models for DBP included exam year as a categorical variable.
