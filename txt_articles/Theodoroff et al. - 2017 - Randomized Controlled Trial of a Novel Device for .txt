Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine if a
customized stimulus from the Otoharmonics Levo System
reduces tinnitus perceptions and reactions for people with
bothersome tinnitus.
Method: Sixty participants were randomized to 1 of 3
groups that used sound therapy devices during sleep that
differed in their acoustic stimulus: (a) tinnitus-matched (TM),
(b) noise stimulus (NS), and (c) bedside sound generator
(BSG). Outcome measures were the Tinnitus Functional Index
(TFI), numeric rating scale of tinnitus loudness, and tinnitus
loudness match. A Bayesian hierarchical model was fit to
estimate the differences in treatment efficacy among groups.
Results: Average tinnitus reactions and perceptions
improved across treatment groups. We are at least 87%
certain that treatment with TM or NS reduces mean TFI
compared to treatment with BSG, with an estimated
relative efficacy of 4.5–5 points greater reduction. We
are at least 95% certain that treatment with TM results in
greater reduction in mean numeric rating scale (NRS) of
tinnitus loudness compared to the other groups, with an
estimated relative efficacy of about 0.75 points greater
reduction.
Conclusions: This study offers some support for greater
average improvement in reactions to tinnitus with TM or
NS devices compared to the BSG device. The TM group,
compared to the BSG and NS groups, showed a greater
reduction in ratings of tinnitus loudness on the NRS on
average.

innitus is the perception of sound that has no source
outside of the head. It is most typically associated
with exposure to loud noise, which can also cause
hearing loss (Axelsson & Barrenäs, 1992; Penner & Bilger,
1995). A direct correlation exists between degree of hear-
ing loss and prevalence of tinnitus—the likelihood of incur-
ring tinnitus increases with a greater degree of hearing loss
(Coles, 2000). In general, tinnitus can occur as the result of
noise damage, blast exposures, head and neck trauma or
pathology, drugs or medications, and other medical condi-
tions (e.g., acoustic neuroma, cardiovascular and cerebro-
vascular disease, hyper- and hypothyroidism; Hoffman &
Reed, 2004; Meikle, Creedon, & Griest, 2004). Tinnitus
can result in psychological reactions (e.g., anxiety, sadness,
distress), attention and concentration difficulties, problems
with sleeping, and overall reduced quality of life (Cima,
Crombez, & Vlaeyen, 2011; Crönlein et al., 2016; Dobie,
2003; Erlandsson & Hallberg, 2000).
Research has shown that, regardless of the initial
injury associated with tinnitus onset (e.g., cochlear damage),
the continued perception of tinnitus is generated by neural
activity within the central auditory system (Eggermont,
2003). Although the exact neural mechanism giving rise to
the percept is still unknown (Eggermont, 2015), the various
neurophysiological models of tinnitus are helpful in provid-
ing the foundation for different therapies to be developed.
A commonly used therapy for tinnitus is sound stim-
ulation. One rationale for using sound stimulation is to in-
duce neural plastic changes in the central auditory system
to counteract the maladaptive changes thought to be linked
to the tinnitus percept (Shore, Roberts, & Langguth, 2016).
Another proposed benefit of using sound stimulation is

 that it may help induce habituation, resulting in noticing
the tinnitus less often and reduced reactions to tinnitus
(McKenna, 2004).
There are many different methods and products of-
fering sound therapy for tinnitus patients that are primarily
to be used when the individual is awake (Hoare, Searchfield,
El Refaie, & Henry, 2014). Pedemonte, Testa, Diaz, and
Suarex-Bagnasco (2014) examined the use of sound stimula-
tion during sleep. Study participants matched their tinnitus
percept as closely as possible to an acoustic stimulus, which
was played back to them during sleep to induce changes in
neural activity and networks associated with information
processing. This study provided the basis for the develop-
ment of a commercially available product that was designed
and manufactured by the Otoharmonics Corporation (Levo
System, version 2.2.6).
Objective
Evidence-based research should guide the interven-
tions recommended for people distressed by their tinnitus.
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that are properly con-
ducted are the most important source for providing such
evidence (Keech, Gebski, & Pike, 2007). This study was an
RCT designed to determine if an acoustic stimulus mimick-
ing the tinnitus perception delivered during sleep from the
Otoharmonics Corporation’s Levo System reduces tinnitus-
related distress and/or perceived loudness of tinnitus during
awake hours for people who experience bothersome tinni-
tus. More specifically, the goal was to evaluate the efficacy
of the Levo System, a custom in-ear device designed to be
used with a tinnitus-matched stimulus, compared to (a) the
same Levo System but with a noise stimulus chosen by
the participant from a limited range of options and (b) the
Marsona 1288 bedside sound generator (manufactured by
Marpac) for reducing tinnitus-related distress and/or per-
ceived loudness of tinnitus, measured using the Tinnitus
Functional Index (TFI; Meikle et al., 2012) total score, nu-
meric rating scale (NRS) of tinnitus loudness, and tinnitus
loudness match (LM) in dB sensation level (SL) at 1 kHz.
Method
Recruitment and Screening
Participants were recruited from individuals who
previously participated in research projects at the National
Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research and gave their
consent to be contacted for future studies. Participants
were also recruited from the surrounding community via
research flyers posted in public locations and advertise-
ments in local newspapers and online. Initial screening
was done over the telephone to ensure as much as possible
that callers who were invited for an assessment were suitable
candidates. Both veterans and nonveterans were recruited.
Interested callers were asked screening questions to
determine (a) if they experienced tinnitus that was either
intermittent or constant, (b) the duration and temporal
characteristics of their tinnitus using the Tinnitus Screener
(Henry, Griest, Austin, et al., 2016), and (c) how much
the tinnitus affected their quality of life using the Tinnitus
and Hearing Survey (THS; Henry, Griest, et al., 2015). When
tinnitus and hearing loss co-occur, it is common for people
to misattribute the tinnitus as the cause of the hearing prob-
lem rather than the hearing loss (Ratnayake, Jayarajan, &
Bartlett, 2009; Zaugg, Schechter, Fausti, & Henry, 2002).
The THS is a 10-item questionnaire with three sections
evaluating the degree to which auditory complaints (tinni-
tus, hearing problem, and sound tolerance problem) have
been present over the past week, with response options
ranging from “not a problem” to “very big problem.” Can-
didates were required to score at least a 6 for Section A
of the THS, which addresses tinnitus-specific problems. If
candidates scored high enough on the THS, then additional
screening questions were asked to determine their noise
exposure, hearing aid use, and whether or not they were
currently engaged in tinnitus treatment/management.
Candidates who passed the telephone screening were in-
vited to the National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory
Research for evaluation to determine eligibility.
Candidates were paid $20 with cash or a prepaid
debit card for attending the initial appointment, whether
or not they were enrolled. At the initial appointment, can-
didates first underwent informed consent followed by the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act au-
thorization, administered by study personnel. All partici-
pants provided informed consent prior to any procedures
being performed; the VA Portland Health Care System’s
Institutional Review Board reviewed and approved the
study protocol (IRB 3631).
Inclusion Criteria
To be included, candidates were required to (a) have
a score of ≥ 25 (out of a maximum score of 100) on the
TFI; (b) pass the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration
Six-Item Test (Katzman et al., 1983), a screening test for
dementia; (c) have sufficient hearing to enable perception of
the acoustic stimulus at required levels (no single audiometric
threshold of > 70 dB HL, 0.25–8 kHz); (d) report the pres-
ence of tinnitus for at least 6 months; and (e) be English
speaking and capable and willing to complete all aspects of
the study.
Exclusion Criteria
Candidates were excluded if they (a) reported they
“never,” “rarely,” or “sometimes” hear noises in their ears
or head; (b) had a hearing threshold of > 70 dB HL at any
tested frequency between 0.25 and 8 kHz; (c) had conduc-
tive hearing loss defined as an air–bone gap of 15 dB at
more than two frequencies in one ear; (d) were unable to
read and respond appropriately to instructions that appeared
on the computer screen and/or to perform the auditory-
related procedures; (e) were exposed to loud noise as part
of employment or recreational activities (e.g., construction
work or factory work requiring use of hearing protection,
target shooting); (f) had a behavioral flag in their medical
record (at the discretion of study staff); (g) had mental,

 emotional, or health conditions that would preclude full
study participation; or (h) reported already using one of the
study devices.
Outcome Measures
Efficacy of intervention was evaluated with the TFI,
NRS, and LM at 1 kHz. NRS and LM are measures of
tinnitus perception, whereas the TFI measures reactions to
or effects of tinnitus.
TFI
The TFI is a 25-item self-report questionnaire that
has documented validity both for scaling the negative
impact of tinnitus and for measuring treatment-related
changes in effects of tinnitus (responsiveness; Meikle et al.,
2012). The total score for the TFI ranges from 0 to 100,
with higher scores indicating greater problems with tinni-
tus. The TFI has excellent internal consistency (Cronbach’s
α = .97) and high test–retest reliability (r = .86). The au-
thors of the TFI estimated that a 13-point decrease on the
TFI is likely to reflect a change that feels meaningful to
an individual (Meikle et al., 2012).
NRS
The NRS consists of a line marked with equal inter-
vals labeled 0–10 (0 = no tinnitus, 10 = very loud tinnitus;
Johnson, 2005), as distinguished from a visual analog scale,
which requires marking a position along a continuous
line anchored between two end-points. Participants were
instructed to draw a vertical line at any point between
the anchors 0 and 10, indicating the loudness of their tin-
nitus at that moment. This was completed in the sound-
attenuated suite before any audiometric or psychoacoustic
testing to ensure that auditory stimulation would not affect
the tinnitus perception. NRS scores were obtained by mea-
suring the distance from 0 to the vertical line. That value
was divided by the total distance of the line and rounded
to the nearest tenth.
LM
Numerous studies have provided results suggesting
that tinnitus loudness is significantly underestimated when
LMs are obtained at the tinnitus frequency. For this rea-
son, LMs were obtained and reported at 1 kHz, as recom-
mended by Goodwin and Johnson (1980). The “tinnitus
ear” was designated as the ear in which the tinnitus was
perceived to be loudest. If the tinnitus was perceived “in
the head” or to be symmetrical, then the tinnitus ear was
selected as the ear with poorer hearing. All stimuli used
for LM testing were presented to the ear contralateral
to the tinnitus ear. First, a hearing threshold in dB HL at
1 kHz in 2-dB steps was found. Next the 1-kHz tone was
presented at an intensity of 10 dB above the threshold (i.e.,
10 dB SL). The participant was instructed to tell the audiol-
ogist if the intensity of the tone needed to be made louder
or softer to match the loudness of the tinnitus in the
opposite ear. The participant continued to direct the
clinician to make changes in the intensity of the stimu-
lus until it was perceived to be the same loudness as the
tinnitus. LMs at 1 kHz were reported in dB SL (difference
between LM and hearing threshold).
NRS and LM testing were performed to capture any
changes in tinnitus perception; these measurements are two
different approaches yielding subjective judgments about
tinnitus loudness.
Procedures
Initial Visit
After the informed consent and the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act authorization forms
were signed, candidates completed a case history form, the
Tinnitus Screener, THS, TFI, and the Blessed Orientation-
Memory-Concentration Six-Item Test. This was followed
by NRS testing, standard audiologic evaluation (audiome-
try and immittance testing), and LM testing. Audiologic
testing was performed by a study audiologist in a sound-
attenuated suite, using conventional audiologic instrumen-
tation (audiometer and immittance system). Hearing
thresholds were obtained using pure-tone air- and bone-
conduction testing.
Qualified participants were enrolled and randomized
into three treatment groups with equal probability: (a) Levo
System with a tinnitus-matched stimulus (TM group), (b) Levo
System with a noise stimulus (NS group; white noise and/or
band noise), or (c) Marsona 1288 Sound Conditioner/Tinnitus
Masker (bedside sound generator device; BSG group).
Participants randomized to the TM and NS groups
had earmold impressions made, which were sent to a lab to
make custom-fit earbuds; the earbuds are specially designed
earphones, which present the in-ear acoustic stimuli and
therefore are an essential component of the Levo System.
The dispense appointment for participants in the
TM and NS groups was not scheduled until the earbuds
arrived on-site. Participants randomized to receive the
BSG device were scheduled for their dispense appoint-
ment. All participants had outcomes measured prior to
randomization (baseline) and at all follow-up visits.
Levo System Devices
The study audiologists were trained by an Otohar-
monics Corporation representative to dispense the TM and
NS sound therapy devices according to company guide-
lines. Participants randomized to the TM group were fit
according to company guidelines. Participants in the TM
and NS groups received the standard company instructions
on care and maintenance of the sound therapy devices
and custom-fit earbuds. Participants randomized to the
TM group created a tinnitus “sound print” using company
software to identify the sound(s) that most closely matched
the sound(s) of their tinnitus. They were asked to listen to
the sound print every night and to adjust its volume set-
tings to match the loudness of the tinnitus (different from
the LM at 1 kHz performed in clinic). Participants ran-
domized to the NS group were instructed to pick a sound

 (either white noise, band noise, or a combination of noise
stimuli) that was comfortable. Specific instructions were
“pick a sound that is comfortable for you, something that
you could comfortably listen to all night. It is fine to find
something that is soothing, but it is not necessary for the
sound to be soothing. It should not be annoying.” After
self-performing the LM with the device, they adjusted the
volume of the device to a comfortable level prior to using
it during sleep.
Marsona Device
Participants randomized to the BSG group were
instructed on how to use the sound therapy device (includ-
ing care and maintenance) during sleep and received the
same instructions on “how to choose a sound” as received
by participants in the TM and NS groups. Specifically,
they were instructed to select a sound that was comfortable
to listen to all night and that should not be annoying in
any way. Participants in the BSG group were allowed to
select any or a combination of the various sounds the
device generated. In addition, because the BSG device
delivers sounds in the environment and not at ear level,
participants were told if they shared a bedroom to feel
free to include their partner in the conversation about what
sound to listen to throughout the night.
Follow-Up Visits
Participants returned about 3–6 weeks following
their enrollment date to receive their respective devices,
then 1–2 weeks later to check device adjustment and usage.
During the follow-up visits, participants randomized to
the TM group had their tinnitus sound print adjusted
as needed. At each follow-up visit (i.e., Visits 2–4), out-
come testing included the Tinnitus Screener (Visit 2 only),
TFI, NRS, THS, audiometric testing (0.25–8 kHz), and
tinnitus testing (i.e., LM at 1 kHz). Participants used their
device for about 3 months, at which time they attended the
final study visit (i.e., Visit 4) to complete outcome testing
and a follow-up audiologic evaluation. They also answered
questions from an exit interview to determine their subjec-
tive impressions of using the device. This ended their par-
ticipation in the study, and they were allowed to keep their
device. At this time, participants in the NS group were in-
formed that they had been using the sound therapy device
differently than how it is used commercially. These par-
ticipants were given the option (if keeping the device) to
have it reprogrammed and create a tinnitus sound print
or keep it programmed to the noise stimulus they had
been listening to, whichever they preferred.
Counseling
All participants received general educational counsel-
ing about tinnitus using the company’s counseling booklet.
Topics covered by the study audiologists included tinnitus
basics, hearing basics, how the brain works (e.g., neuro-
plasticity and habituation), and options for tinnitus man-
agement. Participants in the BSG and NS groups received
the same counseling as those in the TM group, with the
exception of the last page of the counseling booklet, which
was only shown to participants in the TM group because
it addressed specific information about the acoustic stimu-
lus the TM group received.
Participant Safeguards
Safeguards were established to minimize risk of ex-
posure to high levels of noise: The Levo System device will
not allow the health care professional to set the treatment
duration for more than 8 hr, as it is limited in the soft-
ware design. Also, the suggested guidelines indicate that
the treatment duration should be limited to less than 8 hr
once the sound intensity exceeds 65 dB SPL. Specifically,
the company guidelines recommend that when the device is
used at 80 dB SPL, the treatment duration should be limited
to 4 hr, and when used at maximum output (84.9 dB SPL),
2 hr should be the limit. The hours of use are preset as part
of the process of programming the device in the clinic. Once
the designated hours of use are achieved, the device stops
delivering the sound therapy. The device has data-logging
capabilities, and at every follow-up visit, data were down-
loaded and reviewed to determine if participants were using
the device as instructed.
In spite of these safeguards, to ensure that participants
did not receive excessive daily exposure to sound, any can-
didate who was exposed to loud noise as part of their job
or recreational activity was excluded from participation. In
addition, audiometric testing was performed at every visit to
verify hearing thresholds had not changed from baseline.
Additional safeguards included otoscopic evaluations
at every follow-up visit to inspect participants’ ears for any
sign of irritation from the custom-fit earbuds. If irrita-
tion was reported or detected, the custom-fit earbuds were
remade to resolve the discomfort.
Statistical Considerations
A Bayesian approach to the data analysis was used
in this study (Spiegelhalter, Abrams, & Myles, 2004).
Briefly, a Bayesian analysis is distinguished from classical
approaches by defining probability as a measure of belief
in particular propositions. Figure 1 displays an example
probability distribution expressing beliefs about a particu-
lar parameter (x-axis), which may correspond to, for exam-
ple, the effects of treatment with TM compared to BSG.
The 50% reference line denotes the estimated value of the
parameter, and the 5th and 95th percentiles express 90%
Bayesian confidence intervals. These percentiles define the
range in which we are 90% certain that the true parameter
value lies. This distribution contains all information at
our disposal about the parameter value, including prior
studies, substantive knowledge in particular clinical settings,
and new data. New measurements are combined with this
probability distribution via Bayes theorem to define a new
“posterior” probability distribution of the parameter values.
Because the posterior distribution describes everything
that we know about a particular parameter, we can com-
pute, for example, the probability that the parameter is less

 than zero by taking the area under the curve below zero, as
indicated by the shaded region.
In many aspects of data analysis a Bayesian approach
is indistinguishable from classical methods. However, Bayesian
analysis forgoes esoteric constructs such as p values in favor
of intuitive probability statements about treatment effect
sizes and relative effects. For example, a classical analysis
would test the one-sided null hypothesis that the true differ-
ence in treatment effects is greater than or equal to zero
and reject this hypothesis with a p value of less than .05.
With a Bayesian analysis, one simply computes the poste-
rior probability that the true difference in treatment effects
is less than zero, as shown in Figure 1.
The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy
of each device for relieving tinnitus perceptions and/or tin-
nitus distress measured using the TFI score, NRS, and LM
at 1 kHz. It is useful to consider these effects from clinical
as well as research perspectives. On the one hand, it is of
great benefit to know how, for example, an in-ear sound
therapy device that is matched as closely as possible to an
individual’s tinnitus percept (i.e., the TM sound therapy
device) affects perceived loudness of tinnitus after 3 months
of nighttime use. Alternatively, a clinician would benefit
more from an estimate of the expected improvement in
reactions to tinnitus in a new patient seeking treatment for
chronic tinnitus. We present results of this analysis for both
research and clinical “consumers,” in terms of the average
effects of treatment with each sound therapy device on
each outcome (a research focus), as well as the predicted
benefits to a new patient of treatment with each particular
sound therapy device on each outcome (a clinical focus).
We estimate the effects of treatment on each outcome
using a multilevel model with sources of variation in the
observed outcomes due to treatment group effects, time of
measurement, outcome scale, participant effects, and inter-
actions among these. Let yi
k denote the kth outcome mea-
surement on the ith observation, k = 1, 2, 3, indicating the
NRS, LM 1 kHz (dB SL), and TFI score measurements,
respectively. Raw data are given in Supplemental Material
S1. Associated with each yi
k is a subject index s and treat-
ment group index g = 1 (BSG), 2 (NS), and 3 (TM), and a
binary indicator vi identifying whether the ith observation
is from baseline (vi = 0) or posttreatment (vi = 1). The yi

(All normal distributions are parameterized in terms of the
mean and standard deviation.) In this particular notation,
s[i] denotes the sth subject on whom the ith observation
was made, and g[i] denotes the gth treatment group to which
the ith observation is attached. The δs[i]

are participant-
specific random effects on the kth outcome measure centered
at a participant-specific, across-measure mean ξs plus the
overall population mean on the kth response, denoted μk,
so that

Note that, according to this model, the baseline mean of
the kth response is equal to μk regardless of treatment group,
which is reasonable because participants were not random-
ized to a treatment group until after the baseline measure-
ment was taken. The average change to the kth response
occurring after intervention are described by the ag

One can think of the θk as the “participation” effect on
the kth response, whereas φg is the overall effect of the
gth treatment group on all outcomes. The ag
k are interaction
effects between the kth outcome and gth treatment group
on the mean response at follow-up visit. The difference in
treatment efficacy between group g and group ǵ on the kth
outcome measure is given by ag

k.
All measurements were standardized to a mean of
zero and standard deviation of 1, so that the μk are given
a N(0,τμ) prior. All of the variance components, τ and σ,
are given half-normal prior with scale parameter = 0.5.
These give a 90% prior interval on the contrasts between
any two treatment groups of 0 ± 4 points on the NRS
scale, 0 ± 18 dB LM SL, and 0 ± 37 points on the TFI

scale = 2 on the variance components with no appreciable
effect on the results.
Posterior distributions of the parameters ag
k and con-
trasts ag

k summarize our understanding of the effects
of each sound therapy device, alone or in contrast, on tin-
nitus perceptions and reactions. We predict the benefits
to a new patient by simulating new observations from the
normal likelihood that generates the yi
k in our model. From
this effort, we can predict the probability of any improve-
ment in a new patient under each treatment modality, as
well as the magnitude of expected benefit.
Computation
The model was fit using SAS software Version 9.4.
The model-fitting code is given in the Supplemental Mate-
rial S1. The No-U-Turn Sampler was used for evaluating
the joint posterior distribution. Three chains with random,
dispersed starting values were run for 5,000 iterations fol-
lowing a 1,000-iteration burn-in period, and convergence
was evaluated with Gelman–Rubin diagnostics. All param-
eters had diagnostics of 1.004 or less. Model fit was evalu-
ated by plotting the yi
k and posterior predictive interquartile
range for each observation, and no gross deviations due to
lack of fit were found.
Results
A total of 454 individuals were prescreened over the
telephone. After learning more about the nature of the
study, 64 decided to not continue the screening process.
After administering the Tinnitus Screener and THS, 260
callers were deemed ineligible. The remaining 130 pre-
qualified to attend the initial in-clinic screening visit. After
104 individuals attended the in-clinic screening visit, the
study reached its enrollment goal of 60 participants. Fig-
ure 2 displays the number of individuals screened, consented,
enrolled, and randomized into each group.
Randomization Error
Two participants were incorrectly randomized by
study personnel and were therefore not included in the sta-
tistical analyses. This resulted in n = 19 in the TM group,
n = 19 in the NS group, and n = 20 in the BSG group, for
a total of N = 58.
Demographic Information
The majority of the participants were male (n = 39;
female, n = 19) with a mean age of 59.7 years (range =
30–72). Participants’ age as a function of group assignment
and other baseline demographic information is displayed
in Table 1.
Raw Data
Figure 3 shows the sample data collected in this study.
Each panel corresponds to a treatment group (columns)
and outcome measure (rows). The x-axis denotes the time
point of measurement, and the y-axis denotes the possible
score on the respective measurement scale. Black circles
are individual participant data with lines connecting each
participant’s observed data at baseline and end of treat-
ment. The thick red line is the sample mean with standard
errors. Sample data show fairly consistent changes over
time across treatment groups, although the TM group ap-
pears to improve slightly better on the NRS scale. There is
little difference in changes on the LM scale across groups.
Last, TFI score appears to change fairly consistently across
groups.
Model-Based Results
Posterior distributions of the parameters estimating
the mean change from baseline in each outcome for each
treatment group are shown in Figure 4. Recall that in
Bayesian analysis knowledge about the parameters (in this
case change from baseline) is expressed as probability dis-
tributions. Each point in Figure 4 is the 50th percentile of
the posterior probability distribution of the average change
from baseline; the thick bars are the posterior interquartile
range, and the thin lines are the posterior 90% intervals.
The reference line at zero indicates no change from base-
line; positive values indicate worsening of symptoms; nega-
tive values indicate improvement. Note that the change
from baseline is expressed in standard deviations to facili-
tate comparisons across outcome measures. The posterior
estimated change on the original scale is shown along the
x-axis for each treatment group.
Figure 4 shows considerable variation in the change
from baseline across outcome measures and comparatively
less variability among treatment groups within each out-
come measure. It is apparent that all groups showed some
average improvement from baseline on all outcomes, though
there is a nonnegligible probability (> 10%) that average
NRS got worse for the BSG and NS groups. There is little
variation among groups in improvement on the LM at
1 kHz (3.6–4 dB SL reduction). Average change in the TFI
after 3 months of sound therapy during sleep reveals a re-
duction of 16 points in the BSG group, 20.6 points in the
NS group, and 21.2 points in the TM group. There is little
evidence of any difference between the TM and NS groups.
Table 2 shows 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of the
posterior distribution of change from baseline contrasts
between treatment groups on each outcome measure. Con-
trasts are expressed as mean differences between groups on
the original measurement scale. The last column in Table 2
shows the posterior probability that the first group listed
in the contrast column showed greater improvement than
the second group listed.
Contrasts Among Treatment Groups on Tinnitus Perception
The NRS measure shows at least 95% certainty (95%
for TM vs. BSG; 97% for TM vs. NS) that the TM sound
therapy device generated greater reduction in average sub-
jective ratings of tinnitus loudness. This effect was on the

 order of about 0.7- or 0.8-point greater improvement com-
pared to the other groups. As seen in the 50% column in
Table 2, we estimate that the TM group showed about a
0.75-point greater reduction in perceived loudness on the
NRS than the other two groups (90% confidence interval
[−1.4, −0.0] for TM vs. BSG and [−1.7, −0.1] for TM
vs. NS; these correspond to roughly [−1.5, −0.1] across
both contrasts). The treatment groups were virtually indis-
tinguishable in their effects on the LM at 1 kHz scale, with
no contrast greater than 0.5 dB SL.
Contrasts Among Treatment Groups on Tinnitus Reactions
In terms of average change in tinnitus-related dis-
tress, the model reveals an 87% and 91% posterior proba-
bility that NS and TM groups, respectively, improved
average TFI more so than the BSG group (Table 2). We
estimate that the TM and NS groups reduced tinnitus
reactions by, on average, 4.5–5 points more on the TFI as
compared to the BSG group (90% confidence interval
[−12.0, 0.9] for TM vs. BSG and [−11.9, 1.6] for NS vs.
BSG; these correspond to roughly [−12, 1] across both
contrasts). The TM and NS groups were essentially indis-
tinguishable from each other in their effects on the TFI:
With 56% posterior probability, the TM group was better
than NS group by about 0.6 points.
Predicted Benefits From Each Sound Therapy Device
The Bayesian analysis also facilitates predictions about
the efficacies of each treatment option for a new patient.
These predictions are made under the assumption that a
new patient is drawn from the same pool of people with
tinnitus distress from whom the study participants were
drawn. Table 3 shows the posterior predicted distribution
of change from baseline under each treatment regimen for
each outcome. Also shown are the posterior probabilities
of any improvement from baseline. Note that predictions
for an individual patient are intrinsically less precise than

 estimates of average treatment effects in a population of pa-
tients. Accordingly, the posterior probabilities of improve-
ment are considerably lower than seen in Figure 4 and give
a more tempered view of the expected effects of these sound
therapy devices on tinnitus.
The predicted chance of improvement on subjective
ratings of tinnitus loudness (i.e., NRS) is a little better than
a coin toss in the BSG or NS groups and somewhat better
for the TM group (74% chance of improvement). The chance
of improvement on the 1-kHz LM is at least 67% (NS group)
with little expected difference among groups. Finally, there
is at least 84% certainty that any of the study devices will
improve TFI outcomes, although there is little basis for pre-
ferring any particular sound therapy device. The last column
in Table 3 shows the predicted probability of improving by
at least 13 points on the TFI, which is considered enough
of a reduction to be a meaningful improvement to an indi-
vidual (Henry, Griest, Thielman, et al., 2016; Meikle et al.,
2012). These last probabilities are considerably lower than
that of any improvement, because they require greater
changes for what an individual would consider a meaning-
ful reduction in tinnitus distress.
Discussion
Using some form of sound therapy to manage tinni-
tus perceptions and reactions has been employed for centu-
ries and is documented in writings dating back to the Roman
Empire, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance, to name a
few (Heller, 2003). Current-day approaches to manage the ef-
fects of tinnitus still favor using some form of sound therapy,
often via a medical device (for a review, see Hoare et al., 2014).
Comparing and contrasting the numerous sound-based ap-
proaches that exist is difficult because of the lack of stan-
dardized methods to assess tinnitus perceptions and reactions
and the limited number of RCTs performed evaluating the
clinical effectiveness of sound therapy for tinnitus (Hobson,
Chisholm, & El Refaie, 2010, 2012; Landgrebe et al., 2012).
The goal of this RCT was to evaluate the efficacy of
using a specific in-ear sound therapy device during sleep

 for 3 months (i.e., TM group) for relieving tinnitus percep-
tions and/or distress compared to two control sound ther-
apy devices (NS and BSG groups). The interpretations of
the results are discussed in terms of what we know to be
true based on (a) average effects of treatment with each
sound therapy device on each outcome and (b) predicted
benefits of treatment with each particular sound therapy
device on each outcome.

 To evaluate efficacy, three outcome measures were
used: (a) a questionnaire psychometrically validated to
examine treatment responsiveness (TFI score), (b) a
measure of self-rated tinnitus loudness (NRS), and (c) a
psychoacoustic LM at 1 kHz. The test battery used in this
RCT is consistent with the recommendations of Newman,
Sandridge, and Jacobson (2014) by capturing aspects of
the tinnitus percept as well as treatment-related change.
Average Effects of Treatment
Tinnitus reactions and perceptions improved across
treatment groups. We found in our sample at least 85%
posterior certainty that the TM and NS groups improved
more than the BSG group on the TFI. The analysis also
showed at least 95% posterior certainty that treatment with
the in-ear TM sound therapy device results in greater im-
provement on the NRS than the other two groups. The
treatment groups are virtually indistinguishable in their
effects on the LM at 1 kHz, with no contrast greater than
half a dB.
Predicted Benefit
It is important to remember that discussing expecta-
tions of what a new patient would experience is different
from discussing the mean treatment effects of the sound
therapy devices used in this study. Even though these are
fundamentally different concepts, it is possible to discuss
the results of this study in terms of what a new patient
could expect when selecting a sound therapy device (for
tinnitus) to be used during sleep, at least to the extent
that a new patient responds in the same way as a partici-
pant drawn from this RCT.
Results on each of the outcome measures indepen-
dently have value in assisting clinicians to help patients
make an informed decision about selecting a sound ther-
apy device. For patients most interested in learning how
to manage their reactions to tinnitus, these “new patients”
are very likely to experience reduced tinnitus distress with
any of the sound therapy devices evaluated in this RCT.
For patients focused on the loudness of their tinnitus,
our model predicts the best chances for the most improve-
ment on self-rated tinnitus loudness, but not subjective
LMs, are with the in-ear TM sound therapy device. The
terms “improvement” or “reduced perception” used to
describe the effects on tinnitus perception are not synony-
mous with elimination of the perception or a “cure” and
should be interpreted only as some reduction in the subjec-
tive 0–10 rating of tinnitus loudness. It is not possible to
know if this change in subjective rating of tinnitus loud-
ness would be considered meaningful to a patient.
Unlike the TFI metric, there are no established esti-
mates for how much change is needed on either the NRS
or LM at 1 kHz to be considered meaningful improvement
to an individual. Evaluating “treatment-related change” is
not straightforward. Applying this concept to tinnitus is
challenging because there is no widespread acceptance of
what type of, or degree of, change in tinnitus perceptions
would be considered meaningful improvement for a patient
receiving treatment. It is possible for changes in tinnitus
perceptions or reactions to occur, but they may not be
equated with meaningful improvement in the eyes of the
person seeking treatment. A variety of possible changes
following tinnitus interventions can occur, and the diffi-
culty lies in evaluating what type or degree of change other
than suppressing the tinnitus (i.e., finding a cure) would
constitute enough of a treatment-related change to be con-
sidered beneficial to a tinnitus patient (Theodoroff, Griest,
& Folmer, 2017).
Limitations
Because of the nature of the sound therapy devices
used in this study, blinding was not possible nor was it
feasible to create a true placebo device. All participants
knew up front that two groups would be receiving custom
earbuds for devices to be used at ear level, whereas the
third group was to use a sound therapy device that played
sounds through a BSG. It is possible that participants
who received custom earbuds to be used with the in-ear
devices (TM and NS groups) were influenced by receiving

 something “special,” and the degree that might have con-
tributed to the outcomes of this study is unknown.
The BSG and NS groups served as control groups,
but not in the same manner as a placebo-controlled group;
therefore, it is not possible to quantify how much of a pla-
cebo effect might also have contributed to these outcomes
(Kaptchuk, 2002). When interpreting these findings, it is
important to recognize that this study used self-reported
outcomes. Just the act of participating in a clinical trial
can have a positive effect on outcomes, regardless of the
treatment received (for more information on placebo effects
and controlling for expectations, see Potter, Mallinckrodt,
& Detke, 2014).
It is not uncommon for individuals with tinnitus to
report fluctuations in their tinnitus perceptions, and no
established standard exists to assess the reliability of sub-
jective ratings of tinnitus loudness. In an effort to create a
standard, Henry, Fausti, Flick, Helt, and Ellingson (2000)
provided guidelines to address reliability in tinnitus psy-
choacoustic LMs at various frequencies and also noted
that there are two primary sources of variability in obtain-
ing consistent tinnitus psychoacoustic measures over time:
(a) variability in the tinnitus sensation itself and (b) mea-
surement error that occurs due to changes in equipment,
testing procedures, interpretation, and normal response vari-
ability that occurs regardless of whether the tinnitus percept
is stable or not.
Finally, this study was not designed to look at sus-
tainability of improvement. No measurements were per-
formed at any time point after the “end of treatment” to
determine how long any reported benefit continued. Fu-
ture prospective studies involving the TM device should
include assessments after 3 months to investigate how long
possible benefit is sustained. Another limitation is the un-
known generalizability of these results to tinnitus patients
seen in the clinic. All participants in the current study were
given their respective devices free of charge within the con-
text of a research study. In a clinical setting, tinnitus pa-
tients may have different expectations than in a research
study and would likely take into account the cost of dif-
ferent sound therapy device options and consider the cost-
to-benefit ratio of each. The economic value compared to
expected benefit of a therapy device is something that
would commonly be discussed and factored into the decision-
making process and is not something this study can address
(Newman & Sandridge, 2012).
Conclusions
This study evaluated the efficacy of a unique tinnitus
sound therapy device (TM) that is used only while sleep-
ing. An RCT was conducted to compare outcomes between
treatment with TM and two control treatments: (a) sham
stimulus (NS) and (b) standard of care (BSG). The sham
stimulus allowed for insights into how much of the effec-
tiveness of the TM device might be attributed to selecting
a stimulus that mimics the tinnitus percept. The standard-
of-care group was intended to represent typical tinnitus
sound therapy during sleep through use of a commonly
used BSG.
Results from this study offer some support for
greater average improvement in reactions to tinnitus with
TM or NS devices compared to the BSG device. The TM
group, compared to the BSG and NS groups, showed a
greater reduction in ratings of tinnitus loudness on the
NRS on average. The magnitude of these relative effects
and the extent to which they generalize to other clinical
environments and patient populations require additional
study. Future controlled trials are needed to determine
if these results are replicable and to evaluate additional
variables and patient factors that would inform clinical
practice.
