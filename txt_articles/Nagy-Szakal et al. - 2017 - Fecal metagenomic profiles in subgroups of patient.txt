Abstract
Background: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is characterized by unexplained
persistent fatigue, commonly accompanied by cognitive dysfunction, sleeping disturbances, orthostatic intolerance,
fever, lymphadenopathy, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The extent to which the gastrointestinal microbiome and
peripheral inflammation are associated with ME/CFS remains unclear. We pursued rigorous clinical characterization,
fecal bacterial metagenomics, and plasma immune molecule analyses in 50 ME/CFS patients and 50 healthy controls
frequency-matched for age, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic site, and season of sampling.
Results: Topological analysis revealed associations between IBS co-morbidity, body mass index, fecal bacterial
composition, and bacterial metabolic pathways but not plasma immune molecules. IBS co-morbidity was the strongest
driving factor in the separation of topological networks based on bacterial profiles and metabolic pathways. Predictive
selection models based on bacterial profiles supported findings from topological analyses indicating that ME/CFS
subgroups, defined by IBS status, could be distinguished from control subjects with high predictive accuracy. Bacterial
taxa predictive of ME/CFS patients with IBS were distinct from taxa associated with ME/CFS patients without IBS.
Increased abundance of unclassified Alistipes and decreased Faecalibacterium emerged as the top biomarkers of ME/
CFS with IBS; while increased unclassified Bacteroides abundance and decreased Bacteroides vulgatus were the top
biomarkers of ME/CFS without IBS. Despite findings of differences in bacterial taxa and metabolic pathways defining
ME/CFS subgroups, decreased metabolic pathways associated with unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and increased
atrazine degradation pathways were independent of IBS co-morbidity. Increased vitamin B6 biosynthesis/salvage and
pyrimidine ribonucleoside degradation were the top metabolic pathways in ME/CFS without IBS as well as in the total
ME/CFS cohort. In ME/CFS subgroups, symptom severity measures including pain, fatigue, and reduced motivation
were correlated with the abundance of distinct bacterial taxa and metabolic pathways.
Conclusions: Independent of IBS, ME/CFS is associated with dysbiosis and distinct bacterial metabolic disturbances
that may influence disease severity. However, our findings indicate that dysbiotic features that are uniquely ME/CFS-
associated may be masked by disturbances arising from the high prevalence of IBS co-morbidity in ME/CFS. These
insights may enable more accurate diagnosis and lead to insights that inform the development of specific therapeutic
strategies in ME/CFS subgroups.

 Background
Myalgic
encephalomyelitis/chronic
fatigue
syndrome
(ME/CFS) is an unexplained, chronic debilitating dis-
order that in the USA alone is estimated to affect up to
2.5 million people, with annual costs of $24 billion [1,
2]. Diagnosis is based on the presence of three of the fol-
lowing symptoms: (1) fatigue impairing an individual’s
ability to engage in occupational, educational, social, or
personal activities for at least 6 months; (2) post-
exertional malaise and unrefreshing sleep; and (3) at
least one of the following two symptoms: cognitive im-
pairment and orthostatic intolerance [1]. Some patients
report a prodrome with fever, sore throat, and lymph-
adenopathy [3]. Thirty-five to 90% of ME/CFS subjects
report abdominal discomfort consistent with irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS) [4–6].
Bacteria, their metabolites, and the host molecules they
influence are participants in bidirectional communication
pathways linking the gut and the central nervous system
(CNS) [7, 8]. Intestinal dysbiosis can dysregulate local
physiology (as in IBS) and immunological circuits [9] as
well as cognition and mood [10, 11].
Culture-based and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene
sequencing studies of stool bacteria have revealed evi-
dence of dysbiosis (an imbalance of intestinal bacterial
populations) in ME/CFS [12–14]. Altered plasma metab-
olites have been identified that distinguish ME/CFS pa-
tients from healthy controls. At least some of these
metabolites are products of the intestinal microbiome
[15, 16]. Here, we complement and extend this work in
a cohort of 50 ME/CFS and 50 healthy controls using
shotgun
metagenomic
sequencing
(SMS),
metabolic
pathway analysis, and linkage to clinical data and plasma
immune profiles. We also employ a novel topological
data analysis (TDA) platform that reveals relationships
that may be overlooked with linear analytical models.
Results
Study population characteristics
Subjects included 50 ME/CFS cases and 50 healthy controls
recruited at four sites across the USA (New York, NY; Salt
Lake City, UT; Incline Village, NV; and Miami, FL) who
met the 1994 CDC Fukuda [17] and the 2003 Canadian
consensus criteria for ME/CFS [18]. Subject demographics
are shown in Table 1. Cases included 41 female and 9 male
ME/CFS patients (mean age 51.1 years; standard error of
the mean (SEM) 1.6). Controls included 41 female and 9
male subjects (mean age 51.3 years; SEM 1.6). All case and
control samples were collected between June 22, 2014, and
October 27, 2014. IBS was diagnosed in 21 of 50 ME/CFS

CFS + IBS patients (43%) reported having IBS diagnosis
prior to ME/CFS. No controls reported a diagnosis of IBS.
Twenty-eight ME/CFS patients and 22 controls had a high

TDA analysis of fecal microbiota, predicted bacterial
metabolic pathways, plasma immune molecule profiles,
and clinical features
Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples was
pursued to determine microbial composition (relative
abundance of taxa) and infer bacterial metabolic path-
ways in the ME/CFS and control subjects. An average of
7 Gb of sequence per sample (from 100 bp, paired-end
Illumina reads) was generated using high-throughput se-
quencing. Levels of plasma immune molecules were
quantitated by immunoassay. We built a TDA network
comprised of 100 samples (50 cases and 50 controls)
and 1358 total variables. The variables consisted of the
following elements: 574 representing the relative abun-
dance of bacterial taxa; 586 representing metabolic path-
ways (131 superpathways and 455 individual metabolic
pathways); 61 reflecting levels of each plasma immune
molecule in the assay; 80 representing symptoms (health
questionnaire items); and 57 co-morbidities and demo-
graphic variables.
Relationships among these datasets were analyzed using
TDA (AYASDI software) to identify multidimensional net-
works and the individual factors (microbial, metabolic
pathways, immune molecules, and clinical variables) that
distinguish those networks.
The ME/CFS subjects formed separate topological net-
works from the control subjects in TDA (Fig. 1). IBS co-
morbidity was the strongest driving factor in the separ-
ation of metagenomics in ME/CFS. TDA revealed differ-
ences in bacterial taxa and metabolic pathways between
ME/CFS, ME/CFS + IBS, and ME/CFS without IBS vs.
controls (Additional file 1: Table S1A). At the family level,
the relative abundances of Lachnospiraceae and Porphyro-
monadaceae were lower in the ME/CFS (both with and
without IBS) compared to the controls, whereas the rela-
tive abundance of the family Clostridiaceae was higher. At
the genus level, the abundances of Dorea, Faecalibacter-
ium, Coprococcus, Roseburia, and Odoribacter were lower
in the ME/CFS compared to the controls, whereas abun-
dances of Clostridium and Coprobacillus were higher. The
12 bacterial species driving the differences between the
ME/CFS
and
control
groups
were
Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii, Faecalibacterium cf., Roseburia inulinivorans,
Dorea longicatena, Dorea formicigenerans, Coprococcus
catus, Odoribacter splanchnicus, Ruminococcus obeum,
and Parabacteroides merdae (all decreased in ME/CFS)
and Clostridium asparagiforme, Clostridium symbiosum,
and Coprobacillus bacterium (all increased in ME/CFS).
Intragroup variability in the control group was smaller
than in the ME/CFS group (Fig. 1). The TDA-based
microbial taxa and metabolic pathways distinguishing
between ME/CFS + IBS and ME/CFS without IBS vs.
control are shown in Additional file 1: Table S1A. ME/
CFS + IBS had decreased representation from the Pro-
teobacteria phylum, C. catus, and F. prausnitzii species
and increased representation from the Clostridiaceae
family compared to the controls. Superpathway analysis
showed alteration in heme biosynthesis, carboxylates,

Fig. 1 Topological data analysis (TDA) reveals altered metagenomic
profiles in ME/CFS. Metagenomic data including bacterial composition
predicted bacterial metabolic pathways, plasma immune profiles and
symptom severity scores were analyzed by using TDA (AYASDI software)
to define multidimensional subgroups. TDA of variance-normalized
Euclidean distance metric with four lenses [neighborhood lenses (NL1
and NL2), ME/CFS, and IBS diagnosis] revealed that ME/CFS samples
formed distinct networks separately from controls. The controls grouped
more tightly than the ME/CFS patients. IBS co-morbidity was identified as
the strongest driving factor in the separation of metagenomic and
immune profile of ME/CFS individuals. Dots that are not connected to
the networks represent outliers. Metagenomic data including bacterial
composition and inferred metabolic pathways, plasma immune profiles,
and health symptom severity scores were integrated for topological data
analysis (TDA) using the AYASDI platform (Ayasdi, Menlo Park, California).
AYASDI represents high-dimensional, complex biological data sets as a
structured 3-dimensional network [56]. Each node in the network com-
prises one or more subject(s) who share variables in multiple dimensions.
Lines connect network nodes that contain shared data points. Unlike
traditional network models where a single sample makes a single node,
the size of a node in the topological network was proportional to the
number of variables with a similar profile. We built a network comprised
of 100 samples and 1358 variables (574 variables representing bacterial
relative abundance at different taxonomic levels, 61 variables reflecting
levels of each immune molecule in the assay, 586 variables representing
metabolic pathways, 80 variables representing different ME/CFS fatigue,
and other symptom score/health questionnaire items and information
on co-morbidities, and demographic variables). All variables were
weighted equally. Variance-normalized Euclidean distance method was
used as the distance metric; a range of filter lenses (neighborhood lens 1
and 2, ME/CFS, and IBS diagnosis) was used to identify networks

 amino acid (AA), and polyamine metabolism. In the
ME/CFS without the IBS group, the difference was
driven by the increased abundance of members of the
Clostridiaceae family, the Clostridium, and Pseudoflavo-
nifractor genera, and the decreased abundance of mem-
bers of the Porphyromonadaceae family and Odoribacter
and Parabacteroides genera. The bacterial species driv-
ing the differences between the ME/CFS without IBS
and control groups were D. formicigenerans, C. catus,
Blautia hansenii, and Parabacteroides distasonis (all de-
creased in the ME/CFS without IBS) and unclassified
Bacteroides, D. longicatena, Ruminococcus gnavus, C.
symbiosum, Eggerthella lenta, Pseudoflavonifractor capil-
losus, C. bacterium, Clostridium cf. and scindens (all in-
creased in the ME/CFS without IBS). The ME/CFS subgroup
comparison between the ME/CFS + IBS and ME/CFS without
IBS is shown in Additional file 1: Table S1A. Higher KS
(Kolmogorov-Smirnov) scores were found for bacterial taxa
and metabolic pathways distinguishing the ME/CFS + IBS
group from controls. Comparisons involving the ME/CFS +
IBS subgroup (vs. controls and vs. ME/CFS without IBS)
showed stronger associations with bacterial taxa and meta-
bolic pathways than any of the other comparisons.
Four networks defined by IBS co-morbidity and BMI (Add-
itional file 2: Figure S1, Additional file 1: Table S1B) were asso-
ciated with a distinct metagenomic and immune profile.
ME/CFS and ME/CFS subgroups are associated with an
altered microbial composition
Compositional taxonomic analysis based on metage-
nomic sequencing indicated that the two dominant
phyla in both ME/CFS and control individuals were
Bacteroidetes (64.9 and 63.4%, respectively) and Firmi-
cutes (26.6 and 29.7%, respectively) (Fig. 2a). Combined,

 Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes accounted for a mean rela-
tive abundance of 91.5% in ME/CFS cases and 93.1% in
controls. The other phyla (Actinobacteria, Proteobac-
teria, Verrucomicrobia, Euryarchaeota, Lentisphaerae,
and Fusobacteria) were represented at low relative abun-
dance (mean relative abundance <5%) in samples.
Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on the
species-level Bray-Curtis [19] dissimilarity revealed over-
lap between the ME/CFS and control subjects (Fig. 2b).
However, the ME/CFS subjects overall varied from the
controls in the first two principal coordinates [20], ac-
counting for 25% of the total variance (Fig. 2c: PC1
12.67%, p < 0.001; PC2 10.69%, p = 0.03). Within control
subjects, BC dissimilarity was significantly lower than
within ME/CFS subjects, consistent with our findings
based on TDA analysis (Fig. 1) and suggests greater
variability in the ME/CFS microbiota (Fig. 2d). The
between-group (ME/CFS vs. control) BC dissimilarity
comparisons were higher than the within-control com-
parisons (p < 0.001) but was not higher than the within
ME/CFS comparisons (Fig. 2d). Together, these data
provide evidence of greater variability in the microbiota
of ME/CFS patients.
Metagenomic biomarker discovery (linear discriminant
analysis effect size (LEfSe)) identified 22 bacterial taxa
enriched in ME/CFS and 27 enriched in controls
(Fig. 3a). Based on nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test
with Benjamini-Hochberg correction (p < 0.05 and ad-
justed p < 0.2), 41 bacterial species, genera, families, or
orders differed between the ME/CFS and control groups
(Additional file 1: Table S2A). Thirty-seven bacterial taxa
differentiated ME/CFS from controls by both statistical
methods. At the bacterial order and of family levels, the
relative abundances of members of the order Pasteurel-
lales and of the families of Lachnospiraceae, unclassified
Bacillales and Pasteurellaceae were lower in the ME/
CFS patients than in the controls, whereas the relative
abundance of members of the family Clostridiaceae was
higher in the ME/CFS. At the genus levels, the abun-
dances of members of the genera Faecalibacterium,
Roseburia, Coprococcus, Gemella, Dorea, and Haemophi-
lus were lower in the ME/CFS, whereas the abundances
of the genera Clostridium, Pseudoflavonifractor, Anae-
rostipes and Coprobacillus were higher in the ME/CFS.
The bacterial species driving the differences between the
ME/CFS and control groups were F. prausnitzii, Alis-
tipes putredinis, Faecalibacterium cf., R. inulinivorans,
D. longicatena, D. formicigenerans, Eubacterium ventrio-
sum, Eubacterium hallii, Haemophilus parainfluenzae,
P. distasonis, R. obeum and C. catus (all decreased in
ME/CFS) and unclassified Bacteroides, unclassified Alis-
tipes, P. capillosus, Clostridium bolteae, R. gnavus, C.
asparagiforme, Anaerostipes caccae, C. bacterium, C.
symbiosum, and C. scindens (all increased in ME/CFS).

 Species in Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Dorea, Copro-
coccus, Clostridium, Ruminococcus, and Coprobacillus
species were significantly different in the ME/CFS pa-
tients compared to the controls by TDA, LEfSe, and
nonparametric testing (Fig. 3a, Additional file 1: Table
S1A and Additional file 1: Table S2A).
Evidence from TDA that IBS was linked to differences
in disease severity, microbiota, and immune profiles led
us to stratify the patient cohort into ME/CFS + IBS and
ME/CFS without IBS and test for group-specific differ-
ences in the microbiota using linear statistical models.
In comparisons of the ME/CFS + IBS and control
groups, LEfSe identified 12 bacterial species, genera, or
families enriched in the ME/CFS + IBS and 26 bacterial
taxa enriched in the controls (Fig. 3b). Based on non-
parametric
Mann-Whitney
U
test
with
Benjamini-
Hochberg correction (adjusted p < 0.2), 21 bacterial taxa
differed between the ME/CFS + IBS and control groups
(Additional file 1: Table S2B). The two statistical methods
yielded results with overlap in all 21 bacterial taxa. Differ-
ences were driven by increases in representatives of the
Clostridiaceae family, Clostridium and Anaerostipes genera;
and decreases in representatives of the Lachnospiraceae
family,
Faecalibacterium,
Roseburia,
Coprococcus,
and
Dorea genera. The 13 bacterial species driving the differ-
ences between ME/CFS + IBS and controls were F. praus-
nitzii, F. cf., unclassified Faecalibacterium, R. inulinivorans,
C. comes, D. longicatena, E. hallii, D. formicigenerans, R.
obeum, and C. catus (each of which was decreased in the
ME/CFS + IBS) and unclassified Alistipes, C. bolteae, and
A. caccae (which were increased in the ME/CFS + IBS).
In the ME/CFS without IBS, LEfSe identified 29 bacter-
ial species, genera or families enriched in ME/CFS without
IBS and 16 bacterial taxa enriched in controls (Fig. 3c).
Based on nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test with
Benjamini-Hochberg correction (adjusted p < 0.2), 22 bac-
terial taxa differed between the ME/CFS without IBS and
control groups (Additional file 1: Table S2B). Twenty-one
bacterial taxa showed overlap between the two statistical
methods. The differences in ME/CFS without IBS were
driven by the increased abundance of members of Pseudo-
monadales order, the Clostridiaceae and Pseudomonada-
ceae
family,
and
the
Clostridium,
Pseudomonas,
Pseudoflavonifractor, Eggerthella, and Coprobacillus gen-
era and the decreased abundance of members of the
Dorea genus. The 13 bacterial species driving the differ-
ences between the ME/CFS without IBS and control
groups were D. formicigenerans, C. catus, and P. distaso-
nis, (all decreased in ME/CFS without IBS) and unclassi-
fied Bacteroides, R. gnavus, D. longicatena, P. capillosus,
E. lenta, C. symbiosum and scindens, C. bacterium, and
Clostridium cf. (all increased in ME/CFS without IBS).
PCoA analysis based on the BC dissimilarity with ME/
CFS stratified by IBS co-morbidity again showed overlap
in controls and ME/CFS (Fig. 4a). Both the ME/CFS +
IBS and ME/CFS without IBS individuals separated
along PC1 compared to the controls (Fig. 4b: PC1
12.67%, ME/CFS + IBS vs. control p < 0.05, ME/CFS
without IBS vs. control p < 0.001); however, only ME/
CFS without IBS showed separation along PC2 (PC2
10.69%, ME/CFS without IBS vs. control p = 0.030).
While controls had significantly lower within-group dis-
similarity compared to within-group dissimilarities of
both the ME/CFS without IBS and ME/CFS + IBS, ME/
CFS + IBS had the highest within-group dissimilarity
(Fig. 4c). Between-group comparisons demonstrated that
there was lower dissimilarity between the controls and
the ME/CFS without IBS group than there was between
the controls and the ME/CFS group with IBS. Compari-
son between ME/CFS without IBS vs. ME/CFS with IBS
showed higher dissimilarity than control vs. ME/CFS
without IBS but similar dissimilarity as between control
vs. ME/CFS with IBS. Thus, there was as much dissimi-
larity between the two subgroups of ME/CFS defined by
IBS co-morbidity as between control and ME/CFS with
IBS and even greater dissimilarity between the subgroups
of IBS. Together, these results suggest that the ME/CFS
subjects have greater variation between their microbiota
than the control subjects and that ME/CFS subjects with
IBS have the greatest within group variation.
Proportional Venn and circular visualization diagrams
were used to display the overlapping and differentiating
bacterial taxa between the controls and each of the ME/
CFS groups (total ME/CFS, ME/CFS + IBS, and ME/
CFS without IBS) (Fig. 4d, e). The proportional Venn
diagram (Fig. 4d) showed that the relative abundance of
11 bacterial species distinguished both ME/CFS + IBS
and ME/CFS without IBS from the controls. The relative
abundance of 19 bacterial species distinguished the ME/
CFS subjects without IBS from the controls, but did not
help to differentiate the total ME/CFS group from the
control group. Circular visualization (Fig. 4e) showed
both the distinct and overlapping bacterial taxa whose
abundance differentiated the total ME/CFS group, the
ME/CFS + IBS group, and the ME/CFS group without
IBS from the control group.
We compared the number of bacterial species among
the ME/CFS diagnostic groups and the controls. A total
of 363 bacterial species were identified in the entire co-
hort. The number of species identified was similar in
ME/CFS patients and controls (average number of bac-
terial species ± the standard error of the mean: ME/CFS
74.24 ± 1.67; control 77.5 ± 2.07). We also did not find
differences in the number of bacterial species when
comparing subgroups based on IBS status (average num-
ber of bacterial species ± the standard error of the mean:
ME/CFS + IBS 71.62 ± 2.26; ME/CFS without IBS 76.14
± 2.34; control 77.5 ± 2.07).

 Bacterial species distinguish ME/CFS and ME/CFS with IBS
from healthy control subjects
We used three dimensionality reduction methods to fur-
ther analyze the microbial communities that distinguish
ME/CFS subgroups and controls: least absolute shrinkage
and selection operation (LASSO), random forest (RF) and
partial least squares (PLS) (Table 2). Bacterial species were
selected for the predictive logistic regression model if they
met criteria in the dimensionality reduction models. Spe-
cies from the Firmicutes phylum were the chief determi-
nants of ME/CFS group status. The relative abundance of
four bacterial species (C. catus, P. capillosus, D. formici-
generans, and F. prausnitzii) distinguished the ME/CFS
patients from the controls (ROC AUC = 0.831 and cross-

 validated AUC = 0.684). The addition of four more bacter-
ial species (C. asparigiforme, Sutterella wadsworthensis, A.
putredinis, and Anaerotruncus colihominis) improved pre-
dictive performance (ROC AUC = 0.893, cross-validated
AUC = 0.745). This predictive selection model corre-
sponds to our TDA, LEfSe, and nonparametric statistical
findings of differences in Coprococcus, Dorea, Faecalibac-
terium, and Clostridium spp. in total ME/CFS and control
group comparisons.
The relative abundance of distinct bacterial taxa defined
ME/CFS patients with IBS. The relative abundance of just
two bacterial species (Faecalibacterium cf. and Bacteroides
vulgatus) distinguished the ME/CFS + IBS from the con-
trol subjects with a moderate degree of accuracy (ROC
AUC = 0.771; cross-validated AUC = 0.571). Accuracy of
the outcome prediction improved when nine additional
bacterial species: F. cf., F. prausnitzii, B. vulgatus, A. putre-
dinis, C. catus, A. caccae, D. formicigenerans, A. colihomi-
nis, and C. asparagiforme were added to the model (ROC
AUC = 1, cross-validated AUC = 0.791).
Membership in the ME/CFS without IBS subgroup as
compared with the control group was predicted by the
relative abundance of Bacteroides caccae, P. capillosus, P.
distasonis, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella buccalis, Bacter-
oides xylanisolvens, and D. formicigenerans (ROC AUC =
0.948, cross-validated AUC = 0.754). TDA-selected bacter-
ial species of Bacteroides, Clostridium, Pseudoflavonifrac-
tor, and Parabacteroides were found in all statistical tests
(LEfSe, nonparametric and reduction model tests) in the
ME/CFS without IBS group compared to the controls.
The decreased relative abundance of Bacteroides vulgatus
distinguished the ME/CFS without IBS group from the
ME/CFS + IBS group based on all statistical tests (TDA,
LEfSe, nonparametric and reduction model tests).
ME/CFS patients with IBS were distinguished from
ME/CFS patients without IBS by the relative abundance
of eleven bacterial species (ROC AUC = 0.956, cross-
validated AUC = 0.604).
Distinct bacterial metabolic pathways in ME/CFS
Bacterial metagenomic data were used to predict differ-
ences in functional metabolic pathways in the ME/CFS
subgroups. Altogether, 455 individual bacterial metabolic
pathways were identified and analyzed. In superpathway
analyses (total 131 superpathways), LEfSe revealed that
bacterial vitamin B6 biosynthesis and salvage, pyrimidine
ribonucleoside degradation, and atrazine degradation
were significantly enriched while bacterial pathways for
the biosynthesis of arginine, polyamine, unsaturated fatty
acid (FA), and mycolate were significantly reduced in the
ME/CFS compared to the controls (Fig. 5a). The ME/
CFS + IBS group had predicted enrichment in bacterial
pathways for fucose, rhamnose, atrazine degradation and
L-threonine
biosynthesis,
reduced
heme,
AA
and
polyamine biosynthesis, and reduced purine, pyrimidine,
and unsaturated FA metabolism compared to the con-
trols (Fig. 5b). In the ME/CFS without the IBS group,
predicted bacterial pathways of vitamin B6 biosynthesis
and salvage, pyrimidine ribonucleosides, atrazine, gly-
cerol
and
sulfolactate
degradation
were
increased,
whereas unsaturated FA and mycolate biosynthesis were
decreased compared to the controls (Fig. 5c). Nonpara-
metric Mann-Whitney U test with Benjamini-Hochberg
correction (adjusted p < 0.2) further supported findings
from LEfSe showing enrichment in the pathway of atra-
zine degradation in both the ME/CFS and ME/CFS +
IBS groups compared to the controls; predicted bacterial
pathways of arginine, polyamine biosynthesis, and pyr-
imidine ribonucleoside degradation were reduced in the
ME/CFS + IBS (Additional file 1: Table S3). Based on
nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test with Benjamini-
Hochberg correction (adjusted p < 0.2), ME/CFS showed
altered representation of individual bacterial metabolic
pathways linked to the tricarboxylic acid [21] cycle, alco-
hol and aromatic compound degradation, and FA/lipid
metabolism (Additional file 1: Table S3). The ME/CFS +
IBS group was associated with altered bacterial pathways
for FA/lipid metabolism, aromatic compounds biosyn-
thesis, and carbohydrate (CHO)/carboxylate degradation
(Additional file 1: Table S3).
Plasma cytokine concentrations do not distinguish ME/
CFS groups
Immune profiling (Additional file 1: Table S4A) was per-
formed to test for alterations in the ME/CFS and IBS
subgroups. No significant findings were obtained after
adjusting for multiple comparisons of all 61 cytokines.
However, prior to adjustment, TNF-α was increased in
the ME/CFS cases compared to the controls (Additional
file 1: Table S4B) and plasma levels of leptin, CSF-2,
CXCL-8, and TNF-α were higher in the ME/CFS + IBS
patients than the controls (Additional file 1: Table S4B).
The ME/CFS patients without IBS had a pre-adjustment
trend toward increased TNF-α compared to controls.
Unsupervised
hierarchical
clustering
was
used
to
visualize the variation in plasma cytokine levels between
the total ME/CFS, ME/CFS + IBS, ME/CFS without IBS,
and controls. Although the clusters did distinguish a
range of cytokine profiles in individuals (ranging from
high to low cytokine profiles), there was no distinct clus-
tering observed between disease groups (Additional file
2: Figure S2).
A predictive logistic regression model restricted solely
to immune data showed little accuracy in distinguishing
between the ME/CFS diagnostic groups and controls
(total ME/CFS, ME/CFS + IBS, or ME/CFS without IBS
vs. controls; data not shown).

 Correlations of symptom severity scores with bacterial
species abundance and predicted bacterial metabolic
pathways in ME/CFS and ME/CFS subgroups
We investigated whether the relative abundance of individual
bacterial species, defined by their association with ME/CFS
and ME/CFS subgroups (Fig. 3, Additional file 1: Table S2),
correlated with Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) and the
Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI). Additional file 1:
Table S5 shows the significant correlations of bacterial species
with disease severity scores in all ME/CFS, ME/CFS + IBS, or
ME/CFS without IBS cases.
Among all ME/CFS cases, the increased relative abun-
dances of R. gnavus, C. bacterium, C. bolteae, and C.
asparagiforme were associated with better vitality, health
change, and motivation scores. Decreased relative abun-
dances of F. prausnitzii and C. catus were associated
with worse emotional wellbeing scores, while decreased
abundances of R. inulinivorans and D. formicigenerans
were associated with improved motivation scores.
In the ME/CFS + IBS cases, decreased relative abundance
of unclassified Alistipes, D. longicatena, and R. inulinivorans
were associated with improved vitality, health change, and
fatigue scores. Decreased relative abundance of C. comes
and Faecalibacterium species were associated with worse
fatigue scores and worse pain scores, respectively.
In ME/CFS without IBS cases, the increased relative
abundance of P. capillosus was associated with worse vi-
tality, emotional wellbeing, health changes and motivation
scores. The relative abundances of D. formicigenerans and
C. scindens were associated with improved motivation
scores, similar to patterns observed in total ME/CFS.
Metabolic pathways predicted from bacterial metagenomic
gene content revealed correlations between activity in specific
pathways and clinical features. Decreased polyamine biosyn-
thesis in both ME/CFS and ME/CFS + IBS cases was associ-
ated with worse physical function scores and increased
fatigue. In ME/CFS + IBS cases, increased fucose and rham-
nose degradation and increased threonin biosynthesis were
associated with worse general wellbeing and pain scores, de-
creased phenylalanine and tyrosine biosynthesis, and de-
creased pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside degradation were
associated with worse general wellbeing, mental fatigue and
pain scores. Increased sulfolactate degradation in ME/CFS
without IBS was associated with better pain scores.
Discussion
ME/CFS is associated with systemic inflammation and both
GI and neurological disturbances [1]. Accordingly, we investi-
gated relationships between microbiota, metabolic pathways,
and plasma cytokine profiles in subjects with ME/CFS and
matched controls. Metagenomic analysis and predictive selec-
tion revealed bacterial species whose relative abundance was
associated with ME/CFS. Based on findings from TDA, LEfSe,
and prediction models, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Dorea,
Coprococcus, Clostridium, Ruminococcus, and Coprobacillus
were strongly associated with ME/CFS; their combined rela-
tive abundance appeared to be predictive of diagnosis.
We cannot directly compare metagenomic results ob-
tained here with others based on 16S rRNA analyses.
Nonetheless, our findings replicate those of other groups in
demonstrating intestinal dysbiosis in ME/CFS [12, 13, 22].

 Firmicutes populations (such as Roseburia, Synthrophococ-
cus, Holdemania, and Dialister) and an increased abundance
of Lactonifactor and Alistipes [13]. Giloteaux et al. reported a
reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes and differences
from controls in representation of 40 bacterial species includ-
ing F. prausnitzii, Ruminococcus spp, Coprococcus spp, E.
lenta, and C. aerofaciens [12]. Our findings also demonstrate
decreased Faecalibacterium species and increased Alistipes in
ME/CFS as the strongest predictors for the disease.
The prevalence of IBS co-morbidity is high in individ-
uals with ME/CFS (35–90%) [4–6]. The underlying link
between these conditions and the directionality of the as-
sociation remains to be addressed. ME/CFS and its under-
lying pathophysiology or the emotional responses to
illness in these individuals may predispose ME/CFS
sufferers to IBS. Anxiety (especially health anxiety) and
depression are common in ME/CFS [23], and anxiety and
depression increase the risk for IBS onset twofold [24].
Alternatively, the association between ME/CFS and IBS
could arise as a result of overlapping pathophysiological
mechanisms that contribute to the development of both
syndromes. For example, infectious gastroenteritis caused

 by bacterial (Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica,
Shigella sonnei, Escherichia coli 0157:H7), viral (noro-
virus), or protozoal (Giardia lamblia) pathogens increase
the risk of post-infectious IBS [25]. ME/CFS is often re-
ported to develop following an acute infectious illness, and
post-infective fatigue states have been reported following bac-
terial, viral, and protozoal infections [26]. Acute giardiasis, for
example, is associated with both increased risk of post-
infective IBS (relative risk = 3.4 [95% CI 2.9–3.8]) and in-
creased risk of post-infective chronic fatigue (relative risk =
4.0 [95% CI 3.5–4.5]) [27]. Finally, the association between
these syndromes could derive from symptom overlap. Indeed,
there is symptom overlap between IBS and other functional
somatic syndromes, including ME/CFS and fibromyalgia syn-
drome [5]. IBS patients also have higher scores on the Fatigue
Impact Scale than healthy individuals [28, 29].
TDA analysis revealed that IBS co-morbidity was a
major driver of topological networks in our ME/CFS co-
hort. Decreased relative abundance of Faecalibacterium
species, R. obeum, E. hallii, and C. comes was associated
with IBS co-morbidity. The Anaerostipes genus was in-
creased in ME/CFS + IBS, but not in ME/CFS without
IBS. In contrast, the relative abundance of unclassified
Bacteroides, P. capillosus, E. lenta (each increased) and P.
distasonis (decreased) were identified as specific markers
for ME/CFS without IBS. The relative abundance of D.
longicatena was increased in ME/CFS without IBS but de-
creased in ME/CFS with IBS. Thus, whereas some differ-
ences in bacterial taxa in the overall ME/CFS cohort are
driven by the high prevalence of IBS co-morbidity, others
are specific to ME/CFS.
The decreased abundance of Faecalibacterium and
Coprococcus species is associated with IBS-like symptoms,
including colonic hypersensitivity, bloating, and GI dis-
comfort in human and animal models [30, 31]. An altered
microbiome is postulated to lead to increased gut perme-
ability (“leaky gut”) and intestinal inflammation with
gastrointestinal symptoms. Increased translocation of lipo-
polysaccharides (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria leads
to autoantibody production, disruption of tight junctions,
and both local gastrointestinal and systemic inflammation
[12, 32, 33]. Prior findings demonstrating alterations in
the microbiota of IBS patients were confirmed here by the
strong association of these bacteria in ME/CFS individuals
with IBS. Given the high rate of IBS co-morbidity in ME/
CFS, such findings highlight the importance of consider-
ing IBS co-morbidity in studies evaluating the role of the
microbiome in ME/CFS.
Metabolic pathways predicted from bacterial metage-
nomic gene content revealed additional alterations in
ME/CFS and ME/CFS subgroups. Similar to our findings
for differences in bacterial composition, differences in
predicted bacterial metabolic pathways found in the total
ME/CFS group were representative of aggregate findings
associated with IBS subgroups. These results suggest
that, as with bacterial taxa, some bacterial metabolic
pathways may be uniquely altered in ME/CFS while
others may be linked to IBS co-morbidity.
Enrichment in the pathway for vitamin B6 biosynthesis
and salvage was the strongest predictor of ME/CFS as well
as ME/CFS without IBS, suggesting that this association is
independent of IBS. Reduced functional B-vitamin status
has been reported in the ME/CFS patients; however, it is
unclear whether such differences can be attributed to ab-
errant host or bacterial metabolic pathways [34]. Pyrimi-
dine
deoxyribonucleoside
degradation
and
individual
pathways linked to the TCA cycle are energy regulating
pathways in host metabolism. Further highlighting the dif-
ferences between ME/CFS with or without IBS, the pre-
dicted bacterial pathway of pyrimidine ribonucleoside
degradation was enriched in ME/CFS without IBS (and in
the total ME/CFS group) but was reduced in ME/CFS
with IBS compared to controls. TCA and energy metabol-
ism may influence the pathophysiology of ME/CFS
through deficient adenosine triphosphate (ATP) produc-
tion [35]. Intermediate metabolites linked to TCA cycles
were identified as specific markers of ME/CFS in metabo-
lomic analyses; however, it is unclear whether bacterial
dysbiosis contributes to these host metabolic changes [36].
The metabolites and components of the urea cycle (such
as AA and ammonia) are also reportedly altered in ME/
CFS [36]. However, our results indicate that the majority
of bacterial AA metabolic pathways that were associated
with ME/CFS were only associated with the ME/CFS +
IBS subgroup. Thus, if bacterial metabolic pathways con-
tribute to these observed host metabolite changes, such
changes could be restricted to the IBS subgroup.
Enriched pathways for the degradation of atrazine in
ME/CFS were also found in our analyses and may be in-
dependent of IBS, as the predicted pathway of atrazine
degradation was a biomarker of both ME/CFS without
IBS and ME/CFS + IBS. Additional studies would be
needed to determine whether atrazine, a chemical found
in pesticides, is present in the GI tract of these individ-
uals and is subject to degradation by these pathways.
The unsaturated FA biosynthesis pathway that was
predicted to be reduced in all three ME/CFS groups is
linked to energy homeostasis and basic components for
several catabolic processes. The ratio of ω3/ω6 FAs and
eicosapentaenoic acid/arachidonic acid are reduced in
ME/CFS patients [37]. The lowered ω3 FA and altered ra-
tio of mono- and polyunsaturated FAs are linked to pro-
inflammatory responses and immune activation [38, 39].
The genes involved in mycolate biosynthesis, a bacterial
pathway predicted to be reduced for ME/CFS without IBS
in this study, are further linked to FA metabolic pathway
initiation and metabolic processes [40]. The reduced rep-
resentation of pathways for heme biosynthesis, as well as
Nagy-Szakal et al. Microbiome  (2017) 5:44 
Page 12 of 17
 arginine and polyamine biosynthesis pathways are specific
for ME/CFS cases with IBS co-morbidity. Arginine is a
precursor of the production of nitric oxide (oxidative
stress responses) and ammonia (urea cycle) metabolism
[41]. Arginine is linked to increased energy and endur-
ance, enhanced memory, and decreased intestinal inflam-
mation via nervous system signaling [42]. While it has
been demonstrated that bacteria in the gut microbiome
play an important role in supplying vitamins to the host
and that the gut microbiome has a profound influence on
mammalian metabolites, additional studies will be needed
to assess the relationship between the bacterial metabolic
pathways identified here based on gene content, bacterial
metatranscriptomics, and the metabolome in ME/CFS
[43–46].
Specific bacterial species and linked metabolic path-
ways were correlated with ME/CFS disease score sever-
ity (vitality, mental fatigue and pain scores). Previous
studies on changes in gut microbiome following exer-
cise challenge in ME/CFS showed alteration within
72 h in ME/CFS subjects compared to baseline and to
controls [22]. Our study did not find association be-
tween metagenomic data and reported post-exercise
malaise/physical fatigue. However, our study was not
designed to assess microbiome changes following exer-
cise in ME/CFS patients.
Plasma cytokines did not define ME/CFS disease
groups in our cohort. Previous studies demonstrated in-
creased pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels (such
as TNFα) in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of ME/CFS
patients with short duration of the disease [47, 48]. The
less robust findings of plasma immune molecule changes
in the current cohort may be explained by the dearth of
ME/CFS cases that had been ill just a short time.
Conclusions
Our results confirm and extend previous work indicating
intestinal dysbiosis in ME/CFS. We further demonstrate
that patterns of dysbiosis vary with IBS co-morbidity.
Future prospective studies should consider more de-
tailed exploration of IBS subtypes, associated GI symp-
toms, and their relationship to ME/CFS dysbiosis. The
identification of ME/CFS networks—characterized by
specific profiles that integrate microbiota, metabolic
pathways, and plasma immune molecules—may enable
more accurate diagnosis and lead to insights that inform
the development of specific therapeutic strategies.
Methods
Study population
Subjects included 50 cases and 50 controls from the
Chronic Fatigue Initiative (CFI) Cohort [49] recruited at
four sites across the USA who met the 1994 CDC
Fukuda [17] and/or 2003 Canadian consensus criteria
for ME/CFS [18]. Controls were frequency matched to
cases on age, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic/clinical site,
and season of sampling [50]. The Fukuda criteria require
that subjects have persistent or relapsing fatigue for a
minimum of 6 months and a substantial reduction in oc-
cupational, educational, social, or personal activities. In
addition, subjects must have at least four of eight of the
following symptoms, including sore throat, lymph node
pain, muscle pain, joint pain, post-exertional malaise,
headaches of a new or different type, memory and con-
centration difficulties, and unrefreshing sleep. The more
restrictive Canadian criteria also require that the sub-
ject must have not only severe fatigue but also post-
exertional malaise with loss of physical or mental
stamina, nonrestorative sleep, disturbed sleep quantity
or rhythm, arthralgia and/or myalgia, two or more neu-
rocognitive manifestations, and autonomic, neuroendo-
crine or immune dysfunction.
All ME/CFS subjects (n = 50) completed standardized
screening and assessment instruments including medical
history and symptom rating scales, had a physical exam-
ination, and provided simultaneous fecal and blood sam-
ples. The fecal samples were collected by subjects 24 to
48 h prior to clinical visits, stored at −20 °C, and trans-
ferred to clinical site in styrofoam boxes with ice packs
provided by study coordinators. Stool and plasma mate-
rials were shipped from clinical sites to the Columbia
University laboratory site on dry ice and stored at −80 °
C prior to processing. Controls (n = 50) of the earlier CFI
cohort study [50] had been found to be free of self-
reported ME/CFS or ME/CFS symptoms or other condi-
tions deemed by the recruiting physician to be nonrepre-
sentative of a healthy control population, including
substance abuse in the prior year and any history of self-
reported
psychiatric
illness;
antibiotics
in
the
prior
3 months; immunomodulatory medications in the prior
year; and clinically significant findings on physical exam
or screening laboratory tests. IBS co-morbidity was not
part of the exclusion criteria of controls.
All participants provided informed written consent in
accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional
Review Board at Columbia University Medical Center.
Clinical assessments
Clinical symptoms and baseline health status were
assessed on the day of physical examination and bio-
logical sample collection from both cases and control
subjects, using two surveys: the Short Form 36 Health
Survey (SF-36) and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inven-
tory (MFI). The SF-36 includes the following subject-
reported evaluations about the current health status:
physical and social functioning, physical and emotional
limitations, vitality, pain, general health perceptions, and
mental health change [51]. Each functional domain was
Nagy-Szakal et al. Microbiome  (2017) 5:44 
Page 13 of 17
 transformed into a 0–100 scale, wherein a score of 100
is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of zero
is equivalent to no disability. The MFI comprises a 20-
item self-report questionnaire focused on general, phys-
ical, and mental fatigue, activity, and motivation [52].
The MFI score was converted to a 0–100-scale score to
facilitate combination and comparison with data ob-
tained using the SF-36 inventory.
IBS co-morbidity was based on subject-reported diag-
noses of IBS on the medical history forms. The subjects
were asked if they had been diagnosed with IBS by their
physician. Additional questions on the severity of symp-
toms and bowel frequency were included. High BMI was
defined as BMI >25 kg/m2 and normal BMI was defined
as BMI <25 kg/m2. No subjects with a BMI below
18 kg/m2 (low BMI) were enrolled in our study.
Shotgun metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatic
analyses
SMS was carried out on DNA extracts obtained from
the 100 fecal samples (50 cases and 50 controls). For
Illumina library preparation, genomic DNA was sheared
to a 200-bp average fragment length using a Covaris
E210 focused ultrasonicator. Sheared DNA was purified
and used for Illumina library construction using the
KAPA Hyper Prep kit (KK8504, Kapa Biosystems).
Sequencing libraries were quantified using an Agilent
Bioanalyzer 2100. Sequencing was carried out on the Illu-
mina HiSeq 4000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).
SMS libraries from cases and controls were grouped into
10 different pools (10 individuals/pool). Each pool yielded
an average of 350 million 100-bp, paired-end reads (mean
= 7 Gb of sequence data per sample; median = 6 Gb). Raw
SMS data were pre-processed using prinseq (v0.20.3) for
end trimming and filtered to exclude low-quality and low-
complexity reads. Adaptor sequences were removed using
cutadapt (v 1.8.3). Human sequences were subtracted from
the dataset using bowtie2 (v2.1.0) and using genomic, mito-
chondrial, and ribosomal sequences downloaded from
NCBI. Bacterial composition (relative abundance) was ob-
tained from raw sequencing data using Metaphlan (v1.7.8)
software and processed by Qiime (v1.8). To evaluate overall
microbiome differences, we used principal coordinate ana-
lysis based on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metric. Meta-
bolic pathway analysis was carried out on host-subtracted
sequences using Humann2 (v0.7.1) software.
Immune profiling analyses
A magnetic bead-based 61-plex immunoassay (custom-
ized ProcartaTM immunoassay, Affymetrix) was used to
measure plasma concentrations of immune molecules
(Additional file 1: Table S3A). Case and control plasma
samples were coded, randomized, and run in duplicate
along with serial standards, buffer controls, and in-house
human control plasma samples [53]. Mean fluorescence
intensities of analyte-specific immunoassay bead sets
were detected by flow-based Luminex™ 200 suspension
array system (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) [54].
Cytokine concentrations were calculated by xPONENT
(build
3.1.971.0)
and
Milliplex
AnalystTM
software
(v.5.1.0.0) using a standard curve derived from known refer-
ence concentrations supplied by the manufacturer. A five-
parameter model was used to calculate final concentrations
by interpolation. Values are expressed in pg/ml. Concentra-
tions obtained below the sensitivity limit of detection
(LOD) of the method were recoded to the mid-point be-
tween zero and the LOD for that analyte for statistical com-
parisons. Values obtained from reading of samples that
exceeded the upper limit of the sensitivity method were fur-
ther diluted and cytokine concentrations calculated accord-
ingly. Feature scaling (data normalization) was used to
standardize the range of cytokine values for the MeV heat-
map [55], and log-transformation was used for network
analysis.
Topological data analyses
Metagenomic
data
including
bacterial
composition
and
inferred
metabolic
pathways,
plasma
immune
profiles, and health symptom severity scores were in-
tegrated for topological data analysis (TDA) using the
AYASDI platform (Ayasdi, Menlo Park, California).
AYASDI represents high-dimensional, complex bio-
logical data sets as a structured 3-dimensional net-
work [56]. Each node in the network comprises one
or more subject(s) who share variables in multiple di-
mensions. Lines connect network nodes that contain
shared data points. Unlike traditional network models
where a single sample makes a single node, the size
of a node in the topological network was proportional
to the number of variables with a similar profile. We
built a network comprised of 100 samples and 1358
variables (574 variables representing bacterial relative
abundance at different taxonomic levels, 61 variables
reflecting levels of each immune molecule in the
assay, 586 variables representing metabolic pathways,
80 variables representing different ME/CFS fatigue,
and other symptom score/health questionnaire items
and information on co-morbidities; and demographic
variables). All variables were weighted equally. Nor-
malized correlation and variance-normalized Euclidean
distance methods were used as the distance metric; a
range of filter lenses (neighborhood lens 1 and 2,
ME/CFS, and IBS diagnosis) was used to identify
networks.
Standard statistical methods were applied to define the
primary variables of these networks. Data were com-
pared by nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests
to identify significant differences between networks.

 Statistical analyses
Between-group differences (ME/CFS, ME/CFS + IBS, ME/
CFS without IBS, and controls) in microbial composition,
fecal metabolic pathway expression, plasma immune mol-
ecules, and symptom severity were tested using the non-
parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Benjamini-Hochberg
FDR (false discovery rate) method was used to control the
type I error rate at the 0.2 level [57]. Correlations between
bacterial species and disease score were examined using
nonparametric Spearman correlation.
Bacterial metagenomic and immune profiling assay data
were used to develop a logistic regression model for predic-
tion of the following binary response variables: the diagnos-
tic groups ME/CFS, ME/CFS + IBS, ME/CFS without IBS,
and controls. To eliminate potential multicollinearity, we
used least absolute shrinkage and selection operation
(LASSO) [58] and random forest (RF) [59] feature selection
techniques to reduce high-dimensional data into a represen-
tative set of variables. Partial least squares (PLS) regression
was used to determine the contributions of individual vari-
ables to the latent variable that explained the largest portion
of the covariance. In-sample receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curves were plotted and area under the curve (AUC)
was measured to compare models. To assess the predictive
accuracy of the logistic regression models, random resam-
pling cross-validation was performed with 1000 iterations.
Data were randomly split into a training set (80%) and a test
set (20%) within each iteration. AUC values, prediction error
rates, false positive and negative rates were then averaged
across iterations for all test sets. Sex, age, race, ethnicity,
BMI, site, and season of sample collection were included in
all statistical models as potential confounders.
Differences in the relative abundance of bacteria at all
taxonomic levels were determined with linear discrimin-
ant analysis effect size [60], which couples tests of statis-
tical significance with measures of effect size to rank the
relevance of differentially abundant taxa [61]. Thus, the
Kruskal-Wallis test identifies taxa that are significantly
different in relative abundance among different classes,
and the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) identifies the
effect size with which these taxa differentiate the classes.
For each LEfSe analysis, an alpha value of 0.05 for the
Kruskal-Wallis test and a log-transformed LDA score of
2.0 were used as thresholds for significance. LEfSe ana-
lyses were used to evaluate differences among the fecal
microbiome of the ME/CFS, ME/CFS + IBS, ME/CFS
without IBS, and controls.
Data were analyzed and visualized with SPSS (IBM,
NY), Matlab (R2013a, The Mathworks Inc., MA), Prism 7
(GraphPad Software, CA), BioVenn [62], and Circos [63]
software. Genomic data analyzer (Multiple Experiment
Viewer, MeV 4.8, MA) was used to define the clustering of
metagenomic and immune profile data (with Spearman
correlation and Euclidean distance metrics).
