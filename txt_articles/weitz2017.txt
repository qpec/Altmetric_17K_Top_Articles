BACKGROUND
Although many patients with venous thromboembolism require extended treatment, 
it is uncertain whether it is better to use full- or lower-intensity anticoagulation 
therapy or aspirin.
METHODS
In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study, we assigned 3396 patients with 
venous thromboembolism to receive either once-daily rivaroxaban (at doses of 20 mg 
or 10 mg) or 100 mg of aspirin. All the study patients had completed 6 to 12 months 
of anticoagulation therapy and were in equipoise regarding the need for continued 
anticoagulation. Study drugs were administered for up to 12 months. The primary 
efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent fatal or nonfatal venous thromboem-
bolism, and the principal safety outcome was major bleeding.
RESULTS
A total of 3365 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analyses (median 
treatment duration, 351 days). The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 17 of 
1107 patients (1.5%) receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban and in 13 of 1127 patients 
(1.2%) receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban, as compared with 50 of 1131 patients 
(4.4%) receiving aspirin (hazard ratio for 20 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspirin, 0.34; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20 to 0.59; hazard ratio for 10 mg of rivaroxaban 
vs. aspirin, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.47; P<0.001 for both comparisons). Rates of 
major bleeding were 0.5% in the group receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban, 0.4% in 
the group receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban, and 0.3% in the aspirin group; the rates 
of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were 2.7%, 2.0%, and 1.8%, respectively. 
The incidence of adverse events was similar in all three groups.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with venous thromboembolism in equipoise for continued anti-
coagulation, the risk of a recurrent event was significantly lower with rivaroxaban at 
either a treatment dose (20 mg) or a prophylactic dose (10 mg) than with aspirin, 
without a significant increase in bleeding rates. (Funded by Bayer Pharmaceuticals;

V
enous thromboembolism, which in-
cludes deep-vein thrombosis and pulmo-
nary embolism, is the third most common 
cause of vascular death after myocardial infarc-
tion and stroke.1-3 The mainstay of treatment is 
anticoagulation,4 and in patients without active 
cancer, guidelines suggest the use of direct oral 
anticoagulant agents such as rivaroxaban over 
vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin.4 Antico-
agulation therapy is administered for 3 months 
or longer, depending on the balance between the 
risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism and 
the risk of bleeding.4 In patients without revers-
ible risk factors, the risk of recurrent venous 
thromboembolism is as much as 10% in the first 
year if anticoagulation therapy is stopped.5-9 Pa-
tients in whom thrombosis was triggered by non-
surgical risk factors or who have persistent risk 
factors are at higher risk for recurrence than are 
those with postoperative thrombosis.10 In addi-
tion, because of overlapping risk factors, patients 
with venous thromboembolism are at increased 
risk for arterial thrombotic events, including myo-
cardial infarction, stroke, and vascular death.11-13 
Although extended anticoagulation therapy is 
effective for the prevention of recurrent venous 
thromboembolism,5-9 concern about bleeding of-
ten leads to a reluctance to continue anticoagu-
lant treatment beyond 6 to 12 months. Attempts 
to reduce the risk of bleeding when treatment is 
extended include the use of lower-dose antico-
agulant therapy and the use of aspirin in place 
of an anticoagulant agent.6,12-14
At a dose of 20 mg once daily, rivaroxaban is 
effective for stroke prevention in patients with 
atrial fibrillation15 and for the treatment of ve-
nous thromboembolism after an initial 21-day 
course of higher-dose therapy.7,16,17 At a dose of 
10 mg once daily, rivaroxaban provides effective 
thromboprophylaxis after elective hip or knee ar-
throplasty.18-21 In the Reduced-dosed Rivaroxaban 
in the Long-term Prevention of Recurrent Symp-
tomatic Venous Thromboembolism (EINSTEIN 
CHOICE) trial,22 we compared the efficacy and 
safety of these two doses of rivaroxaban with 
those of aspirin in patients with venous throm-
boembolism who had completed 6 to 12 months 
of anticoagulation therapy and for whom there 
was equipoise regarding the need for continued 
anticoagulation. Secondary aims of the study were 
to determine whether the lower dose of rivar-
oxaban was as effective as the higher dose and 
whether it was associated with less bleeding.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, 
phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety 
of two doses of rivaroxaban with those of aspirin 
for the extended treatment of venous thrombo-
embolism for up to 1 year after the initial 6 to 
12 months of therapy.22 The trial was sponsored 
by Bayer Pharmaceuticals. The steering commit-
tee, which included both academic authors and 
those employed by the sponsor, had final re-
sponsibility for the design of the study, the devel-
opment of the protocol, the oversight of the 
study, the verification of the data, and the analy-
ses. The sponsor collected, maintained, and an-
alyzed the data; the academic authors had access 
to the data at all times through the sponsor. The 
protocol (available with the full text of this article 
at NEJM.org) was approved by the institutional 
review board at each participating center. Written 
informed consent was obtained from all the 
patients.
An independent committee whose members 
were unaware of the study-group assignments 
adjudicated the qualifying initial diagnosis (deep-
vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) and 
all suspected outcomes that occurred during the 
study. An independent data and safety monitor-
ing committee periodically reviewed the study 
outcomes. All the members of the steering com-
mittee contributed to the interpretation of the 
results. The first three authors wrote the first 
draft of the manuscript, and all the steering 
committee members contributed to subsequent 
versions, made the decision to submit the manu-
script for publication, and vouch for the accuracy 
and completeness of the data and for the fidelity 
of the study to the protocol.
Patients
Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study 
if they were 18 years of age or older; had objec-
tively confirmed, symptomatic proximal deep-vein 
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism; had been 
treated for 6 to 12 months with an anticoagulant 
agent, including a vitamin K antagonist or a di-
rect oral anticoagulant agent such as dabigatran, 
rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban; and had not 
interrupted therapy for more than 7 days before 
randomization.
Patients were ineligible if they had a contra-
indication to continued anticoagulant therapy or

Rivaroxaban or Aspirin for Venous Thromboembolism
if they required extended anticoagulant therapy 
at therapeutic doses or antiplatelet therapy. Addi-
tional ineligibility criteria included a calculated 
creatinine clearance of less than 30 ml per min-
ute23,24 or hepatic disease associated with a co-
agulopathy. A full list of inclusion and exclusion 
criteria is provided in the Supplementary Appen-
dix, available at NEJM.org.
Randomization
Randomization with a block size of six was per-
formed with the use of an interactive voice- 
response system and was stratified according to 
the index diagnosis (deep-vein thrombosis or 
pulmonary embolism) and country. Patients were 
enrolled at least 24 hours after they had received 
the last dose of a direct oral anticoagulant agent 
or, if they were receiving a vitamin K antagonist, 
when the international normalized ratio was 2.5 
or lower. Patients were assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, 
to receive 20 mg of rivaroxaban, 10 mg of rivar-
oxaban, or 100 mg of aspirin, all given once 
daily with food. Rivaroxaban (20 mg and 10 mg) 
and matching placebo were provided as identical-
appearing, immediate-release film-coated tablets, 
whereas aspirin and matching placebo were 
provided as enteric-coated tablets. The intended 
duration of administration of the study drug was 
12 months, but patients who underwent random-
ization after the requisite number of primary 
efficacy outcomes had been reached were treated 
for at least 6 months.
Outcome Measures
The primary efficacy outcome was a composite 
of symptomatic, recurrent fatal or nonfatal venous 
thromboembolism and unexplained death for 
which pulmonary embolism could not be ruled 
out. Recurrent venous thromboembolism includ-
ed fatal and nonfatal pulmonary embolism and 
deep-vein thrombosis. Other efficacy outcomes 
were myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, sys-
temic embolism, venous thrombosis in locations 
other than the deep veins of the lower limbs, 
and death from any cause. The definitions of the 
efficacy outcomes are provided in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
The principal safety outcome was major bleed-
ing.25 Other safety outcomes were clinically rele-
vant nonmajor bleeding, a composite of major or 
clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, and non-
major bleeding that led to study-drug interrup-
tion for more than 14 days.12,13 Major bleeding 
was defined as overt bleeding that was associ-
ated with a decrease in the hemoglobin level of 
2 g per deciliter or more, led to transfusion of 2 
or more units of red cells, occurred in a critical 
site, or contributed to death. Clinically relevant 
nonmajor bleeding was defined as overt bleeding 
that did not meet the criteria for major bleeding 
but was associated with the need for medical 
intervention, unscheduled contact with a physi-
cian, interruption or discontinuation of the study 
drug, or discomfort or impairment of activities 
of daily living.26 (Further details regarding the 
criteria are provided in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix.)
Surveillance and Follow-up
Patients underwent assessment, either in the 
clinic or by telephone, at days 30, 90, 180, 270, 
and 360 and at 30 days after stopping the study 
medication. All the patients who stopped a study 
treatment earlier than scheduled were followed 
until the end of the intended treatment period. 
Patients were instructed to report to the study 
center if they had symptoms suggestive of recur-
rent venous thromboembolism or bleeding. Pre-
specified objective testing was required for pa-
tients in whom an outcome event was suspected.22 
Continuation of anticoagulant or antiplatelet ther-
apy after study completion was at the discretion 
of the treating physician.
Statistical Analysis
The study was designed to test the hypothesis 
that each dose of rivaroxaban would be superior 
to aspirin with respect to the primary efficacy 
outcome. We determined that the occurrence of 
80 primary efficacy outcome events would pro-
vide a power of 90% to show the superiority of 
each dose of rivaroxaban over aspirin (each at a 
two-sided alpha level of 0.05), assuming a rela-
tive risk reduction of 70% with 20 mg of rivar-
oxaban and of 60% with 10 mg of rivaroxaban.7 
On the basis of an expected frequency of the 
primary efficacy outcome of 5.0% at 12 months 
with aspirin,12,13 we calculated that we would 
need to enroll 2850 patients. However, this num-
ber was increased to 3300 when review of blinded 
data revealed a lower-than-expected overall inci-
dence of the primary efficacy outcome.
The efficacy and safety analyses included all 
the patients who had undergone randomization 
with valid informed consent and who had re-
ceived at least one dose of a study medication

Rivaroxaban or Aspirin for Venous Thromboembolism
(intention-to-treat population). The per-protocol 
population excluded patients who had a rate of 
adherence to the study-drug regimen of less than 
80% or who had other major protocol violations. 
Efficacy outcomes were considered during the 
individual intended treatment period, whereas 
safety outcomes were considered during the time 
from administration of the first dose of a study 
drug to 48 hours after the administration of the 
last dose. Efficacy and safety outcomes were 
analyzed with the use of a Cox proportional-
hazards model, stratified according to the index 
diagnosis (deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary 
embolism). Kaplan–Meier curves were construct-
ed to display the distribution of events over time.
Results
Study Patients
From March 2014 through March 2016, a total 
of 3396 patients from 244 sites in 31 countries 
were enrolled. After the exclusion of 31 patients 
(0.9%) because they did not receive any study 
drug, 3365 patients were included in the primary 
analyses. The characteristics of patients in the 
three study groups were similar at baseline, as 
was the median duration of study treatment 
(Table 1). Figure 1 shows the random assign-
ment and follow-up of the patients.
Efficacy
A primary efficacy outcome event occurred in 17 
of 1107 patients (1.5%) who were receiving 20 mg 
of rivaroxaban and in 13 of 1127 patients (1.2%) 
who were receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban, as com-
pared with 50 of 1131 patients (4.4%) who were 
receiving aspirin. Fatal venous thromboembolism 
occurred in 2 patients (0.2%) who were receiving 
20 mg of rivaroxaban, in no patients who were 
receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban, and in 2 patients 
(0.2%) who were receiving aspirin (Table 2). 
Both rivaroxaban doses were superior to aspirin 
Figure 1. Enrollment and Outcomes.
The intention-to-treat population included all the patients who had undergone randomization with valid informed consent and who had 
received at least one dose of a study medication. The per-protocol population included all those in the intention-to-treat population with 
the exception of those who had a rate of adherence to the study-drug regimen of less than 80% or who had other major protocol violations. 
The main reasons for premature discontinuation of a study medication were adverse events, nonadherence to the study-drug regimen, 
protocol violations, and efficacy or safety outcomes.

Rivaroxaban or Aspirin for Venous Thromboembolism
with respect to the primary efficacy outcome 
(hazard ratio for 20 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspirin, 
0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20 to 0.59; 
hazard ratio for 10 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspirin, 
0.26; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.47; P<0.001 for both 
comparisons). The hazard ratio for the compari-
son between the 20-mg and 10-mg rivaroxaban 
regimens was 1.34 (95% CI, 0.65 to 2.75; P 
= 
0.42). 
Similar results were found for the other efficacy 
outcomes (Table 2, and Table S4 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
With aspirin, the rate of recurrent venous 
thromboembolism was 3.6% among the patients 
in whom the index event was provoked (i.e., 
associated with a known event, such as surgery 
or hospital admission) and 5.6% among those 
in whom the index event was unprovoked (i.e., 
idiopathic) (Table 3). Rates of recurrence in pa-
tients whose index events were provoked or 
unprovoked were lower in both the 20-mg riva-
roxaban group (1.4% and 1.8%, respectively) 
and the 10-mg rivaroxaban group (0.9% and 
1.5%, respectively) than in the aspirin group. 
Figure 2A shows the time course of symptom-
atic fatal or nonfatal recurrent venous thrombo-
embolism. Of the 31 patients who were excluded 
from the analyses because they did not take 
any study drug, 1 patient who was assigned to 
receive 20 mg of rivaroxaban had a nonfatal 
primary efficacy outcome event.
Safety
Major bleeding occurred in 6 patients (0.5%) in 
the 20-mg rivaroxaban group and in 5 patients 
(0.4%) in the 10-mg rivaroxaban group, as com-
pared with 3 patients (0.3%) in the aspirin group 
(Table 4). Figure 2B shows the time course of 
major bleeding episodes.
Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding oc-
curred in 30 patients (2.7%) in the 20-mg riva-
roxaban group and in 22 patients (2.0%) in the 
10-mg rivaroxaban group, as compared with 20 
patients (1.8%) in the aspirin group (Table 4). 
Similar results were found for the composite 
outcome of major or clinically relevant nonmajor 
bleeding. Nonmajor bleeding that was associat-
ed with a study-drug interruption for more than 
14 days occurred in 17 patients (1.5%) in the 
20-mg rivaroxaban group and in 12 patients 
(1.1%) in the 10-mg rivaroxaban group, as com-
pared with 12 patients (1.1%) in the aspirin 
group.

Other Outcomes
Myocardial infarction, stroke, or systemic embo-
lism occurred in 3 patients (0.3%) in the 20-mg 
rivaroxaban group, in 5 patients (0.4%) in the 
10-mg rivaroxaban group, and in 7 patients (0.6%) 
in the aspirin group (Table 2). The rates of death 
from any cause were 0.7% and 0.2% in the 20-mg 
and 10-mg rivaroxaban groups, respectively, as 
compared with 0.6% in the aspirin group. Rates 
of adverse events were similar in the three study 
groups (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
In prespecified subgroup analyses of the pri-
mary efficacy outcome and the composite out-
come of major and clinically relevant nonmajor 
bleeding, results were consistent with the overall 
treatment effects (Figs. S1 through S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). During the 30-day 
follow-up after the end of the active study period, 
symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism 
occurred in 2 patients (0.2%) in the 20-mg riva-
roxaban group, in 4 patients (0.4%) in the 10-mg 
rivaroxaban group, and in 6 patients (0.6%) in 
the aspirin group.
Discussion
Clinical strategies for extended anticoagulation in 
patients with venous thromboembolism are un-
certain. Previous studies have shown that as com-
pared with placebo, aspirin reduced the relative 
risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism by 
32% (2.4 percentage points),12,13 whereas a 20-mg 
dose of rivaroxaban reduced the relative risk by 
82% (6.8 percentage points).7 Consistent with 
those findings, our study shows that as com-
pared with aspirin, both the 20-mg and 10-mg 
doses of rivaroxaban reduced the relative risk of 
recurrent venous thromboembolism by about 
70% (approximately 3 percentage points). These 
benefits were observed with rates of major and 
clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding that were 
low and similar to those with aspirin. Therefore, 
we found that rivaroxaban was more effective 
than aspirin for the prevention of recurrent ve-
nous thromboembolism and was associated with 
a similar risk of bleeding.
What are the clinical implications of these 
findings? This study included patients with both 
provoked and unprovoked venous thromboem-
bolism for whom there was equipoise regarding 
the need for continued anticoagulation. Patients 
with unprovoked venous thromboembolism are 
known to be at high risk for recurrence, but the 
risk of recurrence among those in whom venous 
thromboembolism was provoked by minor tran-
sient or persistent risk factors is less certain. We 
found that patients with venous thromboembo-
lism with ongoing risk factors have an apprecia-

the rate of recurrent venous thromboembolism 
in such patients was 3.6%, as compared with a 
rate of recurrence of 5.6% in those with unpro-

Rivaroxaban or Aspirin for Venous Thromboembolism
the number of patients who would need to be 
treated for up to 12 months with rivaroxaban 
instead of aspirin to prevent one episode of fatal 
or nonfatal recurrent venous thromboembolism 
without increasing the risk of bleeding was 33 with 
the 20-mg dose and 30 with the 10-mg dose. 
Prevention of recurrent pulmonary embolism is 
particularly important, because the case-fatality 
rate at 30 days is at least twice as high with 
pulmonary embolism as with deep-vein throm-
bosis.27
Our study has several potential limitations. 
First, patients who required extended treatment 
with therapeutic doses of anticoagulant agents 
were excluded. Therefore, it remains unknown 
whether the 10-mg dose of rivaroxaban would be 
sufficient to prevent recurrence in such patients. 
Second, in this study and in the previous trial 
comparing rivaroxaban with placebo for extended 
treatment of venous thromboembolism, therapy 
was given for up to 12 months. Consequently, 
additional studies are needed to determine the 
utility of continuing treatment for longer periods. 
Third, our study was not powered to show the 
noninferiority of the 10-mg dose of rivaroxaban 
to the established treatment regimen of 20 mg, 
so any conclusions with respect to this issue are 
speculative.
In conclusion, we found that rivaroxaban, at 
both a treatment dose (20 mg) and a thrombo-
prophylactic dose (10 mg), was more effective 
than aspirin for the prevention of recurrent ve-
nous thromboembolism among patients who were 
in equipoise for continued anticoagulation. The 
lower risk of a recurrent event among the patients 
who received rivaroxaban was associated with a 
rate of bleeding similar to that with aspirin.
