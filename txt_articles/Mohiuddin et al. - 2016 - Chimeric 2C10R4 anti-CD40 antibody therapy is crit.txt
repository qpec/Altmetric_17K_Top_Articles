Preventing xenograft rejection is one of the greatest challenges of transplantation medicine.
Here, we describe a reproducible, long-term survival of cardiac xenografts from alpha 1-3
galactosyltransferase gene knockout pigs, which express human complement regulatory
protein CD46 and human thrombomodulin (GTKO.hCD46.hTBM), that were transplanted into
baboons. Our immunomodulatory drug regimen includes induction with anti-thymocyte
globulin and aCD20 antibody, followed by maintenance with mycophenolate mofetil and an
intensively dosed aCD40 (2C10R4) antibody. Median (298 days) and longest (945 days)
graft survival in five consecutive recipients using this regimen is significantly prolonged over
our recently established survival benchmarks (180 and 500 days, respectively). Remarkably,
the reduction of aCD40 antibody dose on day 100 or after 1 year resulted in recrudescence of
anti-pig antibody and graft failure. In conclusion, genetic modifications (GTKO.hCD46.hTBM)
combined with the treatment regimen tested here consistently prevent humoral rejection and
systemic coagulation pathway dysregulation, sustaining long-term cardiac xenograft survival
beyond 900 days.

 P
revious pig-to-primate xenotransplantation studies have
been
beset
with
treatment-related
complications
and
delayed xenograft rejection characterized by thrombotic
microangiopathy (TM) and consumptive coagulopathy (CC)1–3.
Previously, the longest survival for heterotopic cardiac xenografts
using alpha 1-3 galactosyltransferase gene knockout (GTKO) or
GTKO.hCD46 Tg pigs and immunosuppression (IS) that included
aCD154 antibody was 179–236 days, however, the xenografts
ultimately
succumbed
to
the
characteristic
properties
of
delayed rejection4,5. We have recently reported survival beyond
1 year of GTKO.hCD46.hTBM pig heart xenografts that were
heterotopically transplanted into a baboon. The immuno-
modulatory protocol utilized aCD40 antibody, documenting an
attenuated anti-pig antibody elaboration, absence of TM in the
graft and reduced incidence of systemic CC6. Longer-term and
reliable prevention of xenograft rejection in this preclinical model
has not previously been described.
In
the
present
study,
using
baboon
recipients
of
GTKO.hCD46.hTBM porcine hearts, we evaluated an iterative
modification of our previous immunomodulation strategy, one
that primarily targets the anti-CD154-CD40 co-stimulation
pathway. We report consistent prevention of xenograft rejection
in association with ongoing aCD40 (2C10R4) antibody treatment
resulting in graft survival beyond 2 years.
Results
Anti-CD40 significantly prolongs graft survival. The rationale
for using GTKO) pigs to avoid anti-Gal antibody-mediated
rejection,
with
additional
human
complement
regulatory
protein (hCD46) expression to suppress complement acti-
vation, has been previously reported5. Similarly, the benefits of
anti-CD154/CD40, aCD20 and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
immunosuppressive treatment on xenograft survival prolongation
in baboons have been described4–8. We used our established
heterotopic
cardiac
xenotransplantation
model
using
GTKO.hCD46 porcine donors9,10, engineered to additionally
express
the
human
thromboregulatory
protein,
human
thrombomodulin (hTBM)11,12. This genetic modification is
intended to reduce thrombo-dysregulation often associated with
xenografts.
Specific
pathogen-free
baboons
received
a
co-
stimulation
pathway-blocking
drug
regimen
described
in
Table
1,
including
a
non-depleting
primatized
aCD40
monoclonal antibody (2C10R4) (ref. 13). Postoperatively, a
telemetry implant was used to continuously monitor graft
contractility, electrocardiogram (EKG) and body temperature14.
Telemetric surveillance was supplemented with constant video
monitoring of the recipient baboon. Hearts from GTKO.hCD46
pigs engineered using one of two hTBM gene constructs with
different promoters (ICAM in baboons #110, #210 and #910 and
TBM in baboons #15009 and #510) were used (Fig. 1a; cloned
from founder lines selected for high endothelial expression of
hTBM). This was the first time this hTBM transgene was used and
the efficacy of the two available promoters was not known. The
ICAM-2
promoter
was
clearly
superior
in
expression/
functionality
of
TBM
in
endothelial
cells,
both
by
flow
cytometry and generation of antigen presenting cell (APC),
when compared with endothelial cells from the pTBM-TBM pigs.
However, immunochemistry of heart tissue (n ¼ 1 for each
promoter type) indicated more robust expression of hTBM
generated by the porcine endogenous TBM promoter. Both
promoters provided significant expression of TBM on the cardiac
vascular endothelium. Overall, the transplanted TBM þ hearts
with the TBM promoter perform as well or better than the ones

on

aortic
endothelial cells (PAECs; Fig. 1b) and on the endothelial cells
of donor pig littermates (Fig. 1c(i,ii)) is illustrated relative to
human vascular endothelial cells (Fig. 1c(iii)). As expected, hTBM
expression is not detected in the wild-type pig (Fig. 1c(iv)).
As demonstrated in Fig. 2a, all five GTKO.hCD46.hTBM hearts
had significantly prolonged xenograft survival (mean 433 days,
median 298 days and range 159–945 days) compared to
previously reported GTKO.hCD46 pig heart survival using
aCD40 antibody at a lower dose (longest survival 146 days)7
and the same group of animals, described in this study, at an
earlier stage of survival (longest survival 4500 days)6. One
animal that succumbed to an antibiotic-resistant infection with a
contracting graft at 146 days was censored from the survival
analysis; a source of infection was not established on necropsy.
When aCD40 antibody was administered at a lower dose
(25 mg kg � 1) and tapered off over the course of 2 months, none
of the GTKO.hCD46.hTBM grafts survived long term7. In
contrast, significant survival was achieved when a higher dose
of antibody (50 mg kg � 1) was used6. We then elected to decrease
the weekly dose of weekly aCD40 antibody in two animals to
25 mg kg � 1 after 100 days. Both grafts slowly failed in association
with recrudescence of anti-donor antibody. In contrast, the two
recipients receiving a high dose of antibody maintained cardiac
function despite gradual reduction in the antibody dose after 1
year, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The aCD40 antibody was finally
discontinued in baboon #910 on day 560 and in baboon #510 on
day 861. Both grafts rejected after 8–10 weeks of antibody
termination on days 616 and 945, respectively. Progressive graft
dysfunction occurred concomitant with the washout of aCD40
antibody (Fig. 2b) and subsequent return of anti-pig antibody
(Fig. 2c).
Laboratory and mechanistic correlates. Histology of the grafts in
baboons that rejected after aCD40 dose reduction on day 100
demonstrated features typical of xenograft rejection, including
myocyte death, haemorrhage, fibrosis, with sparse cellular infil-
tration by macrophages, neutrophils and occasional lymphocytes
(Fig. 3a(ii,iv)). The histology of the graft from baboon #15009
that succumbed to infection with a contracting graft on continued
aCD40 antibody treatment demonstrated focal myocarditis
(Fig. 3a(iii)). There was no evidence of TM in the graft or CC in
any baboon during ‘full-dose’ antibody treatment (Fig. 3a(i),b(i–
iii),c(i–iii)). After terminating the aCD40 antibody treatment,
long-term surviving hearts demonstrated a typical xenograft
rejection pattern, including characteristic features of TM, vascu-
litis, intravascular thrombus, myocardial necrosis and epicardial
haemorrhage. There was little or no interstitial lymphocytic
infiltration identified in these grafts (Fig. 3b,c). The biopsies from
both long-term animals demonstrated sustained levels of hTBM
expression (Fig. 3d) similar to untransplanted hearts from lit-
termates (Fig. 1c(i,ii)).
As shown in Fig. 4a(i), the haematocrit (HCT) data for all five

 maintained during treatment. Distinct from our work using
GTKO.hCD46 hearts and CD154-based IS5, platelet numbers
were maintained within the normal range (Fig. 4a(ii)), and no
spontaneous bleeding episodes were observed despite continuous
heparin administration (activated clotting time (ACT) goal ¼ 2 �
baseline
level;
Fig.4a(iii)).
These
observations
clinically
demonstrate an absence of CC, which is a hallmark of delayed
xenograft rejection. Both prothrombin time and troponin15,16,
remained within normal limits or undetectable in all baboons
until IS reduction and subsequent onset of rejection (Fig. 4b(i,ii)).
Representative mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) data (Fig. 5a)
illustrate donor-specific suppression of T-cell proliferation in
baboons #510 and #910 one year after transplantation while
receiving aCD40 treatment, with preserved proliferative response
to third party pig antigens.
Following induction treatment with aCD20 antibody after
transplantation, B cells in the recipient baboons were not detected
in peripheral blood for over 60 days (Fig. 5b). During subsequent
recovery, the circulating B-cell subsets were phenotypically
similar to the normal baboon B-cell subsets (Fig. 5c(i,ii)). The B
lymphocytes in peripheral blood lymphocytes proliferated well in
response to anti-IgM antibody stimulation (Fig. 5d), but antibody
elaboration remained suppressed in vitro while aCD40 antibody
remained detectable in the recipient’s serum (Fig. 5e).
Analysis of physiological aspects of pig-to-primate xenotrans-
plantation suggest that the transplanted pig organ is responsive to
primate growth hormone, and thus can grow to a size
proportional to the primate’s organs17,18. As shown in Fig. 5f,
left ventricular mass, estimated based on serial echocardiograms,
increased three to fivefold in size over the first year. However, in
hearts surviving for over 1 year, this growth plateaued at a mass
B60% that of a normal adult human heart. Both the transplanted
pig heart and the recipient baboon heart were of the same size at
this stage. After ceasing aCD40 antibody treatment, further
preterminal graft enlargement was observed, histologically proven
to be myocardial oedema and haemorrhage. Before preterminal
rejection, growth of heart xenografts remained o30% that of
hearts in age-matched domestic pigs19. This indicates that the
organs did not exhibit overgrowth to a size too large for the
recipient.

 Discussion
Until recently, all attempts using conventional or experimental
immunosuppressive regimens and various genetically engineered
donor pigs have yielded inconsistent short-term success, with
substantial recipient morbidity and graft survival typically o9
months4,5,7. Although further improvements may be necessary
for both donor genetics and recipient treatment to achieve
consistent orthotopic heart xenograft performance and justify
potential clinical applications, our data show that the use of
GTKO.hCD46.hTBM donor pigs and an aCD40 (2C10R4)
antibody-based immunomodulatory regimen is associated with
significantly prolonged graft survival. This regimen was well
tolerated in baboons with no evidence of significant infections
related to IS. In our opinion, this regimen appears potentially safe
for human application for patients suffering from end-stage organ
failure
who
might
be
candidates
for
initial
trials
of
xenotransplantation. Our future efforts are to improve this
immunomodulatory regimen to a level that is analogous to what
is
used
for
allotransplantation
and
to
further
tailor
the
immunosuppressive
regimen
accordingly
when
a
less
immunogenic ideal genetically engineered donor is available.
Although the expression of human complement pathway
regulatory proteins8,20,21, the absence of Gal epitope in GTKO
pigs and both modifications together5,22,23 reduced the incidence
of hyperacute rejection and early graft failure, these modifications
have proven insufficient to prevent the delayed antibody-
associated
xenograft rejection in
the context of intensive
conventional or experimental IS. This form of rejection is
characterized by TM in the graft and CC in the recipient4,24–26.
Recently, the role of a carbohydrate antigen N-glycolylneuraminic
acid (Neu5GC) in xenograft rejection in humans has been
described27. Baboons, however, do not have antibodies against
this carbohydrate as they naturally express Neu5GC antigen, and
therefore the impact of Neu5GC on graft rejection cannot be
studied in this model28. Recently, pigs have been engineered
where CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH), the
gene for the enzyme that is responsible for depositing this
carbohydrate on the endothelial surface, has been knocked out.
Removal of this carbohydrate antigen from the pigs will likely
eliminate rejection due to anti-Neu5GC antibody. In addition,
based on known interspecies molecular incompatibilities29 and
coupled with direct evidence that organ and systemic coagulation
pathway dysregulation is implicated in late xenograft rejection,
several human thromboregulatory molecules are being explored
to inhibit primary (due to intrinsic interspecies molecular
incompatibilities) or elicited (by innate or adaptive immune
injury) mechanisms suspected of contributing to the TM and CC
phenotypes.

 For
GTKO
organs,
with
or
without
additional
genetic
modifications, xenograft rejection is generally associated with a
robust antibody response directed against multiple non-Gal
carbohydrate and protein antigens30. Although anti-non-Gal
antibody is not always detected at the time of graft or recipient
demise, we hypothesized that incomplete control of elicited anti-
pig immunity associated with previous regimens constitutes a key
barrier to clinical application.
Historically, IS using ‘conventional’, clinically used agents have
been relatively ineffective to prevent xenograft injury and
associated phenomena, even at doses associated with significant
recipient morbidity and mortality3,31. Depletion of B cells using
aCD20 antibody was associated with improved xenograft and
recipient survival when administered with conventional IS3 or co-
stimulation pathway blocking agents. On the basis of our
experience using blockade of the CD40/154 pathway combined
with of induction anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), aCD20
antibody5,7,8,23 and ongoing MMF, the primary aim of this
study was to evaluate an intensified immunomodulatory aCD40
regimen in concert with GTKO.hCD46.hTBM grafts.
Here we report xenograft survival consistently extending
beyond 4 months (median of 298 days) in five consecutive
recipients of heterotopic GTKO.hCD46.hTBM heart xenografts
treated with a clinically applicable, intensified aCD40 antibody
maintenance regimen, and graft survival prolongation with
normal histology beyond 1 year in two cases. Although
immunologic tolerance was not achieved, donor-specific hypo-
responsiveness was observed, and immunoregulation was main-
tained in the T- and B-cell compartments during ongoing aCD40
antibody and MMF treatments in two long-term animals.
Remarkably, CC and TM were not observed during treatment.
We noted that B cells failed to produce antibodies despite the
reconstitution of naive B-cell phenotypic profile in peripheral
blood 2–4 months after cessation of aCD20 antibody treatment.
Although induction ATG and aCD20 antibody and ongoing
MMF therapy may contribute to this, we speculate that sustained
suppression of B-cell function is primarily attributed to the
ongoing aCD40 antibody treatment since IgM-stimulated B-cell
antibody production in vitro and elaboration of anti-pig antibody
was observed in vivo around the time aCD40 antibody became
undetectable in the serum, and in the context of ongoing MMF
treatment. Indeed, we consider it likely that both aCD40 antibody
(by mediating control of anti-pig B-cell maturation) as well as the
hTBM transgene (by reducing the consequences associated with
one
of
several
identified
interspecies
coagulation
pathway
incompatibilities)
were
necessary
to
achieve
the
observed
xenograft survivals. As in previous work, removal of aCD40
antibody resulted in graft loss, underscoring the importance of

 this pathway to regulate xenograft rejection or acceptance. An
important role for hTBM is suggested by our current work, as we
have shown that ongoing treatment with the anti-CD154-CD40
co-stimulation blockade antibody is associated with inconsistent
protection of GTKO.hCD46 grafts from TM with graft survival
limited to 8 months. It is mechanistically plausible that interplay
between coagulation, anti-pig antibody, complement and T cells
contributed to xenograft rejection. Furthermore, one important
observation was the absence of CC, a hallmark of delayed
xenograft rejection1–3,8 in all five animals. It is likely that the
three genetic modifications used here (GTKO.hCD46.hTBM)
played a significant role in avoiding this complication.
Although additional work will be necessary to determine which
components of this pharmacologic regimen are necessary, in
addition to optimizing drug dosing and evaluating the impor-
tance of the hTBM transgene, this result represents an important
finding for the field of xenotransplantation. Its potential clinical
relevance is underscored, since several non-depleting aCD40
antibodies are in late-stage preclinical development (clinical-
trial.gov identifier NCT01561911, NCT00001789).
In addition, there was a concern that the pig heart, with its
normal development, may grow out of the abdominal cavity. Our
serial echocardiographic estimates of cardiac xenograft volume
throughout a 2-year time span suggest that juvenile pig grafts
exhibit neither supraphysiologic growth nor pathologic hyper-
trophy in this heterotopic transplantation model.
In
conclusion,
the
current
results
confirm
the
pivotal
importance of the CD40-CD154 co-stimulation pathway in the
immunopathogenesis of xenograft rejection. Furthermore, they
support our working hypothesis that local expression of human
thromboregulatory molecules by a GTKO.hCD46 graft is likely
sufficient, and almost certainly necessary to prevent coagulation-
related xenograft injury and associated pathology in the context
of the regimen employed here. Further work is required to
confirm these current findings and test them in a life-supporting
preclinical model. If successful, the approaches described here

 could help translate xenotransplantation of the heart and other
organs into a potentially transformative therapeutic option for the
thousands of transplant candidates who may benefit from the
timely availability of a porcine organ.
Methods
Animals. Only specific pathogen-free baboons (Papio anubis) of either sex
weighing 7–15 kg from University of Oklahoma (Norman, OK) were housed in
a clean pathogen-free facility and were used as recipients of 2–3 years of age. Six-
to eight-week-old genetically modified GTKO pigs of either sex with an over-
expression of human CD46 and TBM, that is, GTKO.hCD46.hTBM pig (Revivicor
Inc., Blacksburg, VA) were used as donors. Two different promoters were used for
the expression of TBM. The ICAM promoter was used for the donor pig hearts
transplanted in baboons #110, #210 and #910 and the TBM promoter was trans-
planted in baboons #510 and #15009. The expression of transgene was stable at the
genomic level, and expression of hCD46 and TBM protein is consistent and high
level across all GTKO.CD46.TBM pigs. During selection of donor pigs special
consideration was given to the approximate size of the hearts and their ability to fit
in baboon’s abdomen. All animals were used in compliance with guidelines pro-
vided by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Animal Care and
Use Committee (ACUC).
Immunosuppression. Immunosuppressive regimen (Table 1) for all recipient
baboons included induction therapy which comprised ATG (Thymoglobulin;
Genzyme, Cambridge, MA, USA); 5 mg kg � 1 on days � 2 and � 1), aCD20
antibody (Rituxan; Genetech, San Francisco, CA, USA; 19 mg kg � 1 on days � 14,
� 7, 0 and 7) for T- and B-cell suppression and aCD40 (clone 2C10R4)15 (NHP
Reagent Resource, Boston, MA, USA; 50 mg kg � 1 on days � 1, 0, 5, 9, 14 and then
1 week) for blocking the co-stimulation pathway. Cobra venom factor (Quidel, San
Diego, CA, USA; 1,500 units; � 1, 0 and 1) was used to inhibit the complement
activation. To maintain the long-term IS, MMF (Genzyme; 20 mg kg � 1 BID) was
used daily and aCD40 antibody (50 mg kg � 1) was infused weekly for 100 days
(n ¼ 2) or for 1 year (n ¼ 2). After 1 year, the antibody dose was first reduced to
25 mg kg � 1 and then was gradually tapered off. All recipient baboons received
continuous heparin infusion to keep the ACT level twice the baseline. Ganciclovir
(Roche, Nutley, NJ, USA; 5 mg kg � 1 per day) was administered daily to prevent
the viral infections. Epogen (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA; 200 U kg � 1) was
administered daily from day � 7 to 7 to maintain the HCT and Cefazolin (Hospira,
Lake Forest, IL, USA; 250 mg) was given twice a day for 7 days to prevent
infections.
At the earliest sign of rejection, demonstrated by slowing down of graft
contractility, rescue therapy was initiated with intravenous bolus dose of
methylprednisolone (125 mg) and then was continued (10–15 mg kg � 1) for next 6
days. Increased heparin dosage was also used to prevent thrombus formation and
ACT was maintained twice the baseline by using heparin. A full dose (50 mg kg � 1)
of aCD40 antibody was used to rescue graft of baboon #510 at the time of rejection.
Heterotopic transplantation procedure of the xenograft. All transplant proce-
dures were performed at an NHLBI core surgical facility.
Donor pig’s chest is opened by a midline incision extending from xiphoid to the
manubrium. Both inferior and right superior vena cava are ligated to occlude venous
return, and the inferior vena cava, left superior vena cava and left atrium are incised.
A cardioplegia catheter in the ascending aorta delivers cold University of Wisconsin
solution proximal to an aortic cross-clamp as crushed saline ice is applied in the
pericardium. The heart is removed by dividing the cavae, left atrium, pulmonary
artery and aorta, leaving a long enough great vessels for the anastomosis. The left
atrium and cavae are oversewn after the heart is taken out of the chest cavity.
The recipient baboon’s abdomen is opened by a midline incision and infrarenal
abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava are exposed and isolated. After
heparinization (dose), side-biting clamps are applied, and aortotomy and
venotomy are made. Donor aorta is anastomosed end-to-side with the recipient’s
aorta, and donor pulmonary artery to the recipient’s inferior vena cava. After
clamp removal, graft decompression is accomplished manually until return of
cardiac function and restoration of sinus rhythm.
Methods for evaluating xenograft functions. Xenograft functions were evaluated
by telemetry (continuously; 24/7 hours per day a week), palpation and ultrasound.
Telemetry device (Konigsberg Instruments, Inc., Pasadena, CA, USA) was
implanted into the recipient baboon to monitor the xenograft left ventricular
pressure (LVP), ECG, and recipient’s temperature. The telemetry device data were
transmitted wirelessly to a receiver (RMISS, Wilmington, DE, USA) attached to the
animal’s cage, which has also recorded peak systolic pressure (PEAK), end diastolic
pressure (END), LVP (PEAK-END), heart rate based on LVP (LVPHR), EKG,
heart rate based on EKG (EKGHR) and recipient’s body temperature (TEMP). LVP
460 mm Hg was considered normal cardiac xenograft function. Any drop in LVP
below 60 mm Hg was considered the point at which the rejection process started to
affect the graft contractility. And if, LVP falls below 10 mm Hg, it was an indication
of complete cessation of xenograft contractility. Palpation of xenograft was
recorded ( þ þ þ þ for fully functional to 0 for rejection) and/or ultrasound was
used to confirm the graft status. Final diagnosis of rejection was made by
histopathology.
Ultrasonography of cardiac xenograft. A two-dimensional echo was performed
on five baboons after xenotransplantation surgery and followed at a minimum
monthly to estimate LV mass during the study period (0–945 days). The LV mass
was calculated based on a cross-sectional area x length formula using the observed
myocardial cross-sectional area at the mid-papillary muscle on a short-axis view
during end diastole. Image selection was based on the ability to clearly identify
cardiac structures (endocardium, epicardium, apex and mitral value). For each
echo, measurements were repeated five times with the average value being used
within the calculations. Calculated LV mass were averaged within 30-day time
periods for the duration of the study period and graphed using excel.
Haematological and biochemical parameter of recipients. Complete blood
count, which includes white blood cell counts, hematocrit, red blood cells,
haemoglobin, platelets, neutrophils and monocytes were analysed by HemaVet 950
hemoanalyser and histochemistry was performed weekly for the first 2 months and
then biweekly until the xenograft is explanted. ACT and troponin levels were
measured by iStat (Abbott Laboratories, Princeton, NJ, USA).
Measurement of non-Gal IgG and IgM antibodies. PAECs were isolated and
cultured from GTKO or GTKO/CD46Tg pigs. Non-Gal antibodies (IgG and IgM)
titre was measured in serum by flow cytometry. Serum samples collected from
baboon before and after transplant every 2–3 days for month and biweekly
thereafter. Flow cytometry was used to measure antibody binding (mean fluores-
cence intensity) with FITC-labelled anti-human IgG (Cat# H10301) and IgM (Cat#
H15101) antibodies (Invitrogen Corp., Waltham, MA, USA) to PAECs on a LSRII
(Becton Dickinson, San Francisco, CA, USA) cytometer. The mean fluorescence
intensity of the cells were analysed with FlowJo software (FlowJo LLC, Ashland,
OR, USA) for each test serum and compared with that produced by the controls.
Detection of aCD40 antibody in baboon plasma. Detection of recombinant
aCD40 in the plasma was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA). Plates were coated with recombinantly expressed extracellular domain of
rhesus CD40 protein fused to maltose binding protein (NHP Reagent Resource) at
a concentration of 0.01 mg ml � 1 and blocked with Super Block (Thermo Scientific,
Woodstock, GA, USA). Pre- and post-treatment samples were serially diluted,
plated for 1 h, and washed with PBS/0.05% Tween 20. Circulating aCD40 antibody,
2C10R4, was detected by incubating with polyclonal donkey anti-human IgG
(H þ L)—horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, West Grove,
PA, USA). Plates were then incubated with 1-Step Ultra TMB ELISA Substrate
(Thermo Scientific). TMB stop solution (Cat# 52-00-01; KPL, Gaithersburg, MD,
USA) was added and the absorbance was read on Mithras LB 940 microplate reader
(Berthold Technologies, Calmbacher, Germany) at 450 nm. A standard curve was
generated with serum spiked with known quantities of aCD40 and was used to
calculate the aCD40 concentration present in the serum.
Measurement of aCD40 antibody levels. Baboon antibody response to aCD40
was measured by ELISA. Ninety-six-well plates were coated overnight with treat-
ment antibody at 0.01 mg ml � 1 in PBS and then blocked with Super Block
(Thermo Scientific) for 15 min. Pre- and post-treatment plasma samples obtained
from each monkey were serially diluted in PBS/2% FBS and applied to the plates
for 1 h. Plates were then washed 10 times with PBS/0.05% Tween and incubated for
1 h. with biotinylated goat anti-human lambda chain (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., San
Diego, CA, USA). This antibody cross-reacts with baboon lambda light chain but
does not recognize the treatment antibody, which has kappa light chains. Plates
were then incubated with 1-Step Ultra TMB ELISA Substrate (Thermo Scientific).
TMB stop solution (KPL) was then added to each plate and OD read on Mithras
LB 940 microplate reader (Berthold Technologies) at 450 nm. A sample was con-
sidered positive at a given dilution if the OD reading of the post-treatment plasma
exceeded the OD of the pre-treatment at the same dilution by twofold.
T- and B-cell phenotyping by FACS analysis. Immuno-staining was performed
on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with fluorescence-conjugated
antibodies. Anti-human CD3 (Cat# 556112), CD4 (Cat# 560811), CD20 (Cat#
560736), CD27 (Cat# 557329), CD38 (Cat# 561106), IgD (Cat# 563313) and IgM
(Cat# 562618) monoclonal antibodies from Pharmingen (BD Bioscience, San
Francisco CA, USA) were used. Anti-CD19 (Cat# 3602211), CD24 (Cat# 311120)
from BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA and anti-CD5 (Cat# MHCD0518) from
Invitrogen Corp. was used. Antibodies (3 or 4 ml per million cells) were used as
recommended or suggested by the manufacturers. Samples were run on FACS
Calibur or LSR2 (BD Bioscience). Flow cytometry analysis was performed using
FlowJo software (FlowJo LLC). The samples from long-term survivors were ana-
lysed and s.d. was calculated and plotted along with the data.

 Immunological assessment of host immune response. PBMCs from recipient
baboon and donor pigs were isolated using Ficoll-Hypaque gradient method12 for
MLR. Donor PAECs were isolated as follows: segments of donor porcine
pulmonary artery were obtained and rinsed in sterile DMEM (pH 7.4; Gibco,
Grand Island, NY, USA), containing 200 U ml � 1 penicillin, 200 mg ml � 1
streptomycin, and 325 mg ml � 1 fungizone and then washed twice with PBS. The
artery was then trimmed for any extra tissue and then soaked in 0.25% trypsin-
ETDA solution in DMEM at 37 �C for 20–30 min. Cell suspension was centrifuged
at 1,000g for 10 min at 4 �C. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was
washed two times with cold medium. T-25 flasks were seeded with 1.5–3 � 105 and
capped loosely and placed in a CO2 incubator at 37 �C (5% CO2 until cells becomes
confluent). The medium was changed every 2 days. Both donor PBMCs and PAECs
were kept frozen for future use as stimulators or antigen-presenting cells in MLR.
Baboon PBMCs (5 � 104) were co-cultured with irradiated donor pig PBMCs
(5 � 104) or PAECs (5 � 103) in triplicate in 96-well round-bottom tissue culture
plates (Cat# 3799; Corning Costar, Corning NY, USA) with a final volume of 200 ml
complete RPMI (Cat# 22400-097; Invitrogen Corp.; cRPMI: RPMI, 10% FCS,
50 mg ml � 1 Gentamicin, 2 mM L-glutamine). The cells were cultured for 5 days in
a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Proliferation was assessed by the MTT-based
CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation (Cat# G3580; Promega
Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) kit. MTS tetrazolium compound is bioreduced by
cells into a coloured formazan product that is soluble in tissue culture medium. The
quantity of formazan product measured by the absorbance at 490 nm is directly
proportional to the number of living cells in culture. The stimulation index (SI) was
calculated by dividing the MLR (contains responder cells* and non-proliferating
stimulator cells**) by the non-stimulated responder cell* response, where
responder cells were from baboon recipient and stimulator cells were irradiated pig
PBMCs or PAECs.

Isolated baboon recipient PBMCs were also stimulated with 10 mg ml � 1 of anti-
IgM (Fab2) antibody (Cat# 109-006-129; Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) for 5
days in humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Proliferation was assessed by the MTT-
based cell proliferation (Cat# G3580; Promega Corporation) kit as mentioned
above and supernatant was also collected. IgG and IgM antibody secretion from the
supernatant of stimulated cells was measured by ELISA using purified anti-human
IgG and IgM (Cat# 109-005-006 and Cat# 109005-043) and peroxidase-conjugated
anti-human IgG and IgM (Cat# 109-035-006 and Cat# 109-035-043) antibody
pairs from Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs.
Histological evaluation of biopsy of xenograft and explanted xenograft.
Paraffin sections from multiple biopsies and sections of explanted xenografts were
stained with haematoxylin and eosin for light microscopy. Sections were analysed
semi-quantitatively for the presence of haemorrhage, necrosis, thrombosis and
cellular infiltrates. Frozen sections of donor pig heart biopsy were immunostained
with mouse anti-CD141 (clone PBS-0; 1:2,000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) or
mouse IgG1 antibody (1:200, Abcam). Detection of CD141 was done using the
EnVision System–HRP-Rabbit antibody (Cat# K4008; Dako, Carpinteria, CA,
USA) followed by DAB þ Chromogen.
Data analysis. The data here report individual results from each animal, therefore
no aggregate statistical tests or randomization was used. The sample size was
limited to five animals because this number of experiments turned out to be
sufficient for evaluating the general potential of novel transplantation protocols in
previous studies without overdoing costly and ethically critical experiments
involving non-human primates. These studies were not blinded and all animals
were of same genetic profile (except the promoter of TBM gene in donor pigs was
ICAM in baboons #110, #210 and #910 and TBM in baboons #510 and #15009),
and received same immunosuppressive regimen. GraphPad Prism or Microsoft
Excel was used to generate all the graphs.
