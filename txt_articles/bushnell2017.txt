IMPORTANCE Benzodiazepines have been prescribed for short periods to patients with
depression who are beginning antidepressant therapy to improve depressive symptoms
more quickly, mitigate concomitant anxiety, and improve antidepressant treatment
continuation. However, benzodiazepine therapy is associated with risks, including
dependency, which may take only a few weeks to develop.
OBJECTIVES To examine trends in simultaneous benzodiazepine and antidepressant new use
among adults with depression initiating an antidepressant, assess antidepressant treatment
length by simultaneous new use status, estimate subsequent long-term benzodiazepine use
in those with simultaneous antidepressant and benzodiazepine new use, and identify
determinants of simultaneous new use and long-term benzodiazepine use.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study using a US commercial claims
database included commercially insured adults (aged 18-64 years) from January 1, 2001,
through December 31, 2014, with a recent depression diagnosis who began antidepressant
therapy but had not used antidepressants or benzodiazepines in the prior year.
EXPOSURES Simultaneous new use, defined as a new benzodiazepine prescription dispensed
on the same day as a new antidepressant prescription.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The proportion of antidepressant initiators with
simultaneous new use and continuing antidepressant treatment for 6 months and the
proportion of simultaneous new users receiving long-term (6-months) benzodiazepine therapy.
RESULTS Of the 765 130 adults (median age, 39 years; interquartile range, 29-49 years;
507 451 women [66.3%]) who initiated antidepressant treatment, 81 020 (10.6%) also
initiated benzodiazepine treatment. The mean annual increase in the proportion
simultaneously starting use of both agents from 2001 to 2014 was 0.49% (95% CI,
0.47%-0.51%), increasing from 6.1% (95% CI, 5.5%-6.6%) in 2001 to 12.5% (95% CI,
12.3%-12.7%) in 2012 and stabilizing through 2014 (11.3%, 95% CI, 11.1%-11.5%). Similar
findings were apparent by age group and physician type. Antidepressant treatment length
was similar in simultaneous new users and non–simultaneous new users. Among
simultaneous new users, 12.3% (95% CI, 12.0%-12.5%) exhibited long-term benzodiazepine
use (64.0% discontinued taking benzodiazepines after the initial fill). Determinants of
long-term benzodiazepine use after simultaneous new use were longer initial benzodiazepine
days’supply, first prescription for a long-acting benzodiazepine, and recent prescription
opioid fills.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE One-tenth of antidepressant initiators with depression
simultaneously initiated benzodiazepine therapy. No meaningful difference in antidepressant
treatment at 6 months was observed by simultaneous new use status. Because of the risks
associated with benzodiazepines, simultaneous new use at antidepressant initiation and the
benzodiazepine regimen itself require careful consideration.

 W
hen patients with depression begin antidepressant
therapy,sometimesabenzodiazepineisaddedtothe
therapy to mitigate the anxiety and insomnia that
occur with depression,1,2 reduce depression severity more
quickly,2,3 and improve antidepressant persistence.2 Because
benzodiazepine dependency may develop quickly,4-6 prac-
tice guidelines recommend only short-term benzodiazepine
use.7 For example, the United Kingdom National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence depression guideline cautions
against using a benzodiazepine for more than 2 weeks when
prescribed to patients also taking antidepressants, noting fur-
ther that it remains unclear whether starting benzodiazepine
therapy at antidepressant therapy initiation produces desir-
able effects in efficacy or tolerability.8
Despite cautions and concerns, benzodiazepines are com-
monlyprescribedduringantidepressanttreatment;10%to57%
of antidepressant users receive benzodiazepines or other anx-
iolytics at some time during antidepressant treatment.9-18 Less
is known about the specific practice of simultaneously begin-
ningbenzodiazepinetherapywithantidepressanttherapy.The
largest US study19 used Veterans Health Administration data
and found that 7.6% of adults with depression who initiated
antidepressant treatment in 2007 also initiated benzodiaz-
epine treatment on the same day; 14.1% continued benzodi-
azepine treatment for 1 year. Patients who simultaneously
started use of these drugs were more likely to have anxiety and
to visit a psychiatrist.19
Comparable statistics for privately insured adults in the
United States, who comprise 64% of all US adults aged 18 to 64
years in 2012,20 have not been published, to our knowledge.
To address current research gaps in US commercially insured
adults, we describe (1) how frequently antidepressant initia-
tors simultaneously start benzodiazepine therapy, (2) changes
in simultaneous new use over time, and (3) the proportion of
simultaneous new users who become long-term benzodiaz-
epine users. In addition, we assessed whether antidepressant
treatment length varies between simultaneous new users and
non–simultaneous new users and identify determinants of si-
multaneous new use and long-term benzodiazepine use.
Methods
Data Source and Study Population
We used Truven’s MarketScan Commercial Claims and En-
counters Database. The database includes claims for inpa-
tient and outpatient diagnoses, procedure codes, and records
for reimbursed, dispensed prescriptions for privately insured
individuals. The study population consisted of adults aged 18
to 64 years with a recent depression diagnosis who initiated
antidepressant treatment from January 1, 2001, through De-
cember 31, 2014. Included adults had no record of a benzodi-
azepine or antidepressant prescription in the year before an-
tidepressanttreatmentinitiation.Allantidepressanttypeswere
included (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin–
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, bupropion, tricyclic an-
tidepressants, and others). Benzodiazepines included al-
prazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clorazepate dipotassium,
diazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, clobazam, flurazepam, es-
tazolam, triazolam, temazepam, midazolam, quazepam, and
clonazepam.Similartothemeta-analysis2onrandomizedclini-
cal trials of benzodiazepine and antidepressant therapy com-
pared with antidepressant therapy alone, we did not include
drugs with similar properties, such as z drugs (eg, zolpidem).
Depression was defined as a recorded inpatient or outpatient
diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, Clinical Modification codes 296.20-296.25,
296.30-296.35, 300.4x, 311.x, 309.28, 309.0-309.1) in the 30
days before or on the date of antidepressant treatment initia-
tion to capture patients initiating use of the antidepressant for
depression. The index depression diagnosis was defined as the
diagnosis on the day of or before antidepressant treatment ini-
tiation. Patients were required to have continuous insurance
enrollment in the year before antidepressant treatment initia-
tion. Patients with a recorded diagnosis of substance abuse,
personality disorder, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia in the
year before antidepressant treatment initiation were ex-
cluded. This study was exempted from review by the Univer-
sity of North Carolina’s Institutional Review Board; there-
fore, no informed consent was required.
Simultaneous New Use
Simultaneous new use was defined as a record of a dispensed
benzodiazepineprescriptiononthedateofantidepressanttreat-
mentinitiation.Allpatientswerepreviouslynaivetotreatment
with antidepressants and benzodiazepines. Sensitivity analy-
ses defined simultaneous new use as a benzodiazepine dis-
pensed up to 30 days after antidepressant treatment initiation.
Antidepressant Treatment Length
Antidepressant treatment length was defined as the number
of days from antidepressant treatment initiation to discon-
tinuation. After the date of antidepressant treatment initia-
tion, the days’ supply was added to a 30-day grace period to
Key Points
Questions When adults with depression begin antidepressant
therapy, how often do they simultaneously begin benzodiazepine
therapy, does antidepressant treatment length differ in patients
with simultaneous new use of an antidepressant and
benzodiazepine, and how often does beginning use of the
medications together result in long-term benzodiazepine use?
Finding In this cohort study of 765 130 adults who started taking
an antidepressant, 81 020 also started taking a benzodiazepine
the same day, with the proportion of patients with simultaneous
new antidepressant and benzodiazepine use increasing from 6.1%
in 2001 to 12.5% in 2012 (then plateauing through 2014). No
clinically meaningful difference in antidepressant treatment
continuation by simultaneous antidepressant and benzodiazepine
new use was found, and 12.3% of patients who began treatment
with both these agents had long-term (6-month)
benzodiazepine use.
Meaning The decision to prescribe a benzodiazepine when a
patient begins antidepressant therapy requires careful
consideration of potential benefits and harms.

 allow for gaps in treatment between fills. If no subsequent pre-
scription was dispensed in the previous prescription’s days’
supplyplusthegraceperiod,thepatientwasconsideredtohave
discontinued treatment at the end of that period. We high-
light antidepressant treatment continuation at 6 months be-
cause guidelines recommend 6 or more months of treatment
in adults with depression1 but also report results up to 2 years.
Long-term Use of Benzodiazepine
Applying a commonly used definition,21 we defined long-
term benzodiazepine use as 6 months (180 days) of continu-
ous benzodiazepine use after simultaneous new use with an-
tidepressant treatment. We estimated benzodiazepine
treatmentlengthusinga30-daygraceperiod;sensitivityanaly-
ses varied the grace period from a more restrictive (10 days)
to a less restrictive definition (60 days). We also counted the
number of benzodiazepine prescription fills before discon-
tinuation of use.
Patient and Prescribing Characteristics
Patient and prescribing characteristics were based on the pres-
ence of diagnostic and procedure codes and dispensed pre-
scriptions in the year before antidepressant initiation. These
characteristics included age, sex, psychiatric comorbidities
(specific consideration to anxiety disorders), treated self-
harm,nonpsychiatriccomorbidities(includedindividuallyand
not part of an index), health care use (often used as a proxy
forhealth-seekingbehaviorandoverallhealth),andregion.We
also included year of antidepressant treatment initiation, ini-
tial antidepressant class, and a marker for recorded psycho-
therapy sessions (Current Procedural Terminology psycho-
therapy codes) in the 30 days before antidepressant treatment
initiation. Although we lack direct measures of baseline de-
pression severity, for the index depression diagnosis we in-
cluded the specific depression diagnosis, whether the index
episode was diagnosed in the hospital or as an outpatient, and
the physician specialty associated with the diagnosis. Be-
causebenzodiazepineshavebeenassociatedwithfractures22,23
andthepotentialharmsofconcurrentbenzodiazepineandopi-
oid use,24-26 we included indicators for recent opioid prescrip-
tions, prior injuries, and fall or fracture risk factors.
Wecharacterizedtheinitialbenzodiazepineprescriptionin
terms of days’ supply and quantity of pills dispensed, pills per
day prescribed (quantity divided by days’ supply), whether the
agentwaslong-acting(clonazepam,clorazepate,diazepam,flu-
razepam, or quazepam),27 and whether the dose per day (pre-
scription strength × pills per day) was above, below, or at the
modal dose. Modal dose per day was determined by the mode
doseforeachbenzodiazepineagent.Forpatientswithmorethan
1benzodiazepineagent(0.9%)dispensedattreatmentinitiation
or more than 1 prescription for the same agent (0.5%), we
summed initial days’ supply, quantity, and pills per day values.
Statistical Analysis
We estimated the proportion of simultaneous antidepressant
and benzodiazepine users among all antidepressant initia-
tors by year, stratified by age group and physician type. We es-
timated the mean annual increase and 95% CIs in the propor-
tion of simultaneous new users, assuming a linear trend.
Figures depicting trends were internally standardized by re-
gion, age, and sex. We used weighted survival curves to esti-
mate antidepressant continuation by simultaneous new use
status with censoring at insurance disenrollment and the end
of the study period. For weighted analyses, we used stabilized-
inverse probability of treatment weights with patient charac-
teristics likely to be associated with simultaneous new use and
antidepressant treatment continuation entered into the pro-
pensity score model. Among simultaneous new users, we de-
scribed characteristics of the initial benzodiazepine prescrip-
tion regimen overall and stratified by the physician specialty
of the index depression diagnosis and estimated the survival
function of continued benzodiazepine use, censoring at in-
surance disenrollment and the end of the study period.
We used Poisson regression with robust variance esti-
mation28 to estimate crude risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs and
multivariable RRs to identify factors independently associ-
ated with (1) simultaneous new use and (2) long-term benzo-
diazepine use. Because of the exploratory nature of the analy-
sis,weincludedalltheaforementionedpatientandprescribing
characteristics in the models. We then removed characteris-
tics independently associated with less than 5% increased or
decreased likelihood of (1) simultaneous new use or (2) long-
termusefromthefullmodel.TheCstatisticsforeachfullmodel
are reported. Factors associated with long-term benzodiaz-
epine use were evaluated in simultaneous new users with 6
months of follow-up.
Results
Ofthe765 130adults(medianage,39years;interquartilerange,
29-49 years; 507 451 women [66.3%]) who started antidepres-
sant therapy, 81 020 (10.6%) simultaneously started benzodi-
azepine therapy. Of adults with a recent anxiety or sleep dis-
orderdiagnosis,20.2%weresimultaneousnewuserscompared
with 8.4% without comorbid anxiety or sleep disorder.
Trends in Simultaneous New Use
Theproportionofsimultaneousnewusersincreasedfrom6.1%
of antidepressant initiators in 2001 to a peak of 12.5% in 2012.
The mean annual increase in the proportion of simultaneous
new users was 0.49% (95% CI, 0.47%-0.51%). This trend held
although with different baseline frequencies when stratified
by physician type and age. A higher proportion of patients di-
agnosed with depression by psychiatrists were simultaneous
new users (2001, 8.7%; 2012, 16.1%) compared with other phy-
sician types (eg, family practice: 2001, 5.0%; 2012, 12.8%)
(Figure 1). The highest mean annual change occurred among
patients aged 25 to 34 years (0.70%; 95% CI, 0.65%-0.75%) and
the lowest among those 18 to 24 (0.40%) and 50 to 64 (0.36%)
years of age (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
Determinants of Benzodiazepine and Antidepressant
Simultaneous New Use
Having a recent anxiety diagnosis was the strongest determi-
nant of simultaneous new use of a benzodiazepine (Table 1 and

 eTable1intheSupplement).Specifically,24.1%ofpatientswith
a recent unspecified anxiety diagnosis (multivariable RR [RR],
2.58; 95% CI, 2.54-2.62) and 39.1% with a recent panic disor-
der diagnosis (RR, 2.67; 95% CI, 2.58-2.76) had simultaneous
benzodiazepine and antidepressant new use. Simultaneous
new use was more common among patients with recent in-
somnia or sleep disturbance diagnoses (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.28-
1.34) and less common among those who received recent psy-
chotherapy (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.81-0.85) or had a history of
self-harm (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59-0.92).
In sensitivity analyses using the 30-day definition of si-
multaneous new use, 13.6% of antidepressant initiators were
simultaneous new users. The trend from 2001 to 2014 re-
mained, peaking at 15.7% in 2012. Strong determinants of si-
multaneousnewuseinprimaryanalysesremainedstrong,with
only slight alterations in their magnitude of association.
Antidepressant Treatment Length
A total of 67.3% of simultaneous new users and 70.3% of non–
simultaneous new users continued antidepressant treatment
at 3 months; 44.3% of simultaneous new users and 47.1% of
non–simultaneous new users continued to take antidepres-
sants at 6 months. After propensity score weighting, crude im-
balances between simultaneous new users and non–
simultaneousnewusersweremitigated,butresultsat6months
were unchanged (non–simultaneous new users, 47.1%; simul-
taneous new users, 43.9%) (Figure 2). Continued antidepres-
sant use at 6 months was similar in the subset of adults with
majordepressivedisorder(n = 201 969;non–simultaneousnew
users, 48.1%; simultaneous new users, 45.6%).
Benzodiazepine Prescription Details
Most benzodiazepine users had an initial prescription for al-
prazolam (43.9%), lorazepam (26.3%), or clonazepam (21.8%).
A total of 13.5% received a short benzodiazepine days’ supply
(1-7 days) at the start of treatment, with variation by physi-
cian specialty (psychiatry, 6.7%; family practice, 15.1%). A total
of26.1%ofsimultaneousnewusersreceivedmorethan50ben-
zodiazepine pills at the start of treatment, an indication of pre-
scribing more than 1 pill per day. We present full benzodiaz-
epine prescription details overall and by physician in eTable
2 in the Supplement.
Long-term Benzodiazepine Use
A total of 12.3% (95% CI, 12.0%-12.5%) of simultaneous new
usersreceivedlong-termbenzodiazepinetreatment,with5.7%
(95% CI, 5.5%-5.9%) continuing benzodiazepine therapy for 1
year. Of simultaneous new users, 6.2% under the shortened
(10 days) and 22.0% under the lengthened (60 days) grace pe-
riods were defined as long-term users. The proportion of si-
multaneous new users becoming long-term users remained
fairly stable from 2001 to 2014 (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Among simultaneous new users with 6 months or more of in-
suranceenrollmentafterthestartoftreatment(61 482[75.9%]),
64.0% did not refill their initial benzodiazepine prescription,
and 14.8% had 4 or more refills before treatment discontinu-
ation (Table 2).
When simultaneously considering long-term benzodiaz-
epine use and antidepressant treatment continuation in adults
with6-monthfollow-up,34.9%continuedantidepressanttreat-
ment and discontinued benzodiazepine treatment 6 months
after the start of treatment, 8.3% continued both antidepres-
sant and benzodiazepine treatment, 54.4% discontinued both
antidepressant and benzodiazepine treatment, and 2.4% con-
tinued benzodiazepine treatment and discontinued antide-
pressant treatment.
The likelihood of becoming a long-term benzodiazepine
user varied by patient and prescription characteristics (Table 3
and eTable 3 in the Supplement). Patients with an initial days’
supply of 8 to 15 days (RR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.30-1.64), 22 to 35
days (RR, 2.91; 95% CI, 2.54-3.33), and more than 35 days (RR,
4.90; 95% CI, 4.15-5.79; prevalence, 2%) were more likely to
become long-term users than were patients with 1 to 7 days’
supply. Older adults (50-64 vs 18-24 years of age; RR, 1.27; 95%
CI, 1.17-1.38), patients initiating a long-acting benzodiazepine
(RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.22-1.34), and patients diagnosed with de-
pression by a psychiatrist vs family practitioner (RR, 1.37; 95%
CI,1.27-1.47)weremorelikelytobecomelong-termusers.Prior
poisoning (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.01-1.64) and a recent opioid pre-
scription (RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.39-1.61) at baseline were also as-
sociated with an increased likelihood of becoming a long-
term user.
Discussion
A total of 10.6% of commercially insured adults who started
taking an antidepressant after a depression diagnosis simul-
taneously initiated benzodiazepine therapy, increasing from
6.1% in 2001 and peaking at 12.5% in 2012. We observed
no clinically meaningful difference in antidepressant treat-
ment length between simultaneous new users and non–
simultaneous new users. Overall, 12.3% of simultaneous new
users became long-term benzodiazepine users, an outcome

 with depression. Whether the increase in simultaneous new
use of benzodiazepines that we observed is related to the
general increase in benzodiazepine use in the US popu-
lation29-31 is unclear. Perhaps the 2001 Cochrane publication
(and the 2009 update) played a role because it summarized
evidence on combined antidepressant and benzodiazepine
use and reported increased short-term response and de-
creased dropout attributable to adverse effects for patients
randomized to combined therapy vs an antidepressant alone
(although only 1 trial lasted >8 weeks).2 Another potential
factor is increased recognition of co-occurring anxiety in
patients with depression.32,33 The plateau that we observed
in simultaneous new use might be related to increased cau-
tion in prescribing benzodiazepines that may have followed
publications26,34,35 that enumerated the potential harms of
benzodiazepines when used concurrently with opioids. In
addition, changes in the use of drugs used for similar indica-
tions but distinct from benzodiazepines (ie, z drugs) might
have influenced observed trends in simultaneous new use of
benzodiazepines.
Although the trends from 2001 to 2014 were observed
across all physician types, adults diagnosed with depression
by a psychiatrist were more likely to simultaneously begin new
useofanantidepressantandabenzodiazepinethanwereadults
diagnosed by other physicians. The difference between phy-
sician type might be related to psychiatrists’ increased famil-
iarity with benzodiazepines, treatment preferences, and train-
ing; the severity of their patient’s depression or comorbid
anxiety; or the possibility that patients diagnosed by psycholo-
gists are more likely to receive prescriptions from another phy-
sician because of prescribing restrictions. On the basis of prox-
ies for depression severity available in our data, simultaneous
new use may well be more common for patients with more se-
vere depression. Because we lack direct depression severity
measures, this remains speculative.
Observational studies10,19 have reported increased con-
tinuation of antidepressant therapy in patients with benzodi-
azepine use, similar to findings from the Cochrane review.2 A
study10 of patients taking antidepressants with prior benzo-
diazepine use (but not specifically simultaneous new use) re-
ported improved antidepressant therapy continuation at 1
monthbutwithoutsignificantdifferencesthereafter.Astudy19
in veterans found that simultaneous new users were more
likely to have adequate acute-phase antidepressant treat-
ment (first 90 days) compared with patients who started use
of an antidepressant without a benzodiazepine. Although we
cannot measure early discontinuation of antidepressant treat-
ment during a prescription period because we rely on dis-
pensed prescriptions and the exact time of discontinuation
after the dispensing of the last prescription is unknown, an-
tidepressant treatment continuation was similar in simulta-
neous new users and non–simultaneous new users.
When prescribed carefully in appropriate patients, ben-
zodiazepines are considered to be useful medications.36 Still,
the decision to simultaneously initiate benzodiazepine
therapy at antidepressant therapy initiation and the prefer-
ence for short-term treatment are influenced by concerns
about benzodiazepines, including dependency, emergency
department visits, and increased risk of fractures, motor
vehicle crashes, and overdose.22-24,34,37-40 Although most
benzodiazepine use among our population was in line with
recommendations8 for short-term use, 12.3% of simultaneous
new users became long-term benzodiazepine users (22.0%
when allowing for more sporadic benzodiazepine use). In the
Veterans Health Administration study, 14.1% of 3320 simulta-
neous new users continued benzodiazepine treatment for 1
year, more than twice our estimate of 5.7%.19 Almost one-
third of long-term benzodiazepine users in our study had an
index depression diagnosis from a psychiatrist, similar to
findings of another US study (adults aged 18-64 years)41 in
which 20% to 33% of all long-term benzodiazepine users

For adjusted analyses, we used stabilized-inverse probability of treatment
weights. Variables entered into the propensity score model (collected in the
year before antidepressant initiation) include sex, age, antidepressant type,
specific depression diagnosis, inpatient depression diagnosis, physician type,
treated self-harm event, psychotherapy use, psychiatric comorbidities with
markers for anxiety disorders, and markers of health care use (outpatient visits
and medication count). In the unweighted cohort, 24.1% of simultaneous new
users and 22.5% of non–simultaneous new users had less than 6 months of
insurance enrollment after antidepressant initiation.

 received at least 1 benzodiazepine prescription from a psy-
chiatrist. More emphasis on short-term use may be needed for
some patients, including patients treated by non–mental
health specialists.
In our study, strong determinants of long-term benzodi-
azepine use included potentially modifiable characteristics of
the initial regimen (eg, days’ supply of the initial benzodiaz-
epine prescription and use of long-acting agents). Future stud-
iesshouldfocusonbetterunderstandinghowdays’supplyand
long-actingagentscontributetoprolongedbenzodiazepineuse.
Although we did not look at whether opioid use was contin-
ued after simultaneous antidepressant and benzodiazepine
new use, the association between a recent baseline opioid pre-
scriptionandlong-termbenzodiazepineuseisparticularlycon-
cerning because of the known risks of concurrent use of these
substances and their pharmacologic interactions.25
Limitations
Somelimitationsshouldbeconsidered.Ourestimatesarebased
on dispensed prescriptions, and we cannot account for pa-
tients who were prescribed but did not fill the benzodiaz-
epine prescription and patients who did not actually take the
dispensed medications. However, irrespective of whether the
medication was taken, our results focus on the clinically rel-
evant questions surrounding coprescribing. We used the most
restrictivedefinitionofsimultaneousnewuseinprimaryanaly-
ses (prescriptions filled on the same day) and, therefore, may
haveunderestimatedclinicallyrelevantsimultaneousnewuse.
However, trends and determinants were consistent under the
moreliberaldefinition.Werestrictedourstudytopatientswho
started antidepressant treatment, but some could have been
treated with antidepressants in the more remote past; it is pos-
sible that prior treatment experiences not captured influ-
enced simultaneous new use decisions. Additional unknown
details surrounding benzodiazepine prescriptions include
whether they were prescribed as needed and how many re-
fills were allowed. Parameter estimates from our multivari-
able models of simultaneous new use and long-term benzo-
diazepineuseshouldnotbeinterpretedcausally.42Inaddition,
our observation of no meaningful difference in antidepres-
sant treatment length by simultaneous new use could be at-
tributable to unmeasured confounding (eg, depression sever-
ity), misclassification, or chance.
Because we required at least a year of continuous cover-
age in the same health insurance plan, we could have in-
duced a selection bias. It is possible, albeit unlikely, that those
who did not meet these requirements differ in their benzodi-
azepine use patterns from those who we studied. Other fac-
tors that influence the generalizability include our decision to
exclude patients with recorded baseline substance abuse and
select psychiatric comorbidities. In addition, trends present in
ourdatacouldbeinfluencedbytheunderlyinginsuranceplans
thatcontributetoMarketScan,whichvariedfrom2001to2014.
Last, we cannot be certain that the antidepressant treatment
was initiated for depression because of the many indications
for antidepressants43 or that the antidepressant prescriber also
prescribed the benzodiazepine. However, although Market-
Scan data cannot identify the physician associated with dis-
pensed prescriptions, preliminary results in a validation study
reveal that the physician who diagnosed the index depres-
sion is a good proxy for the physician of the initial antidepres-
sant prescription and that most simultaneous new users re-
ceived both prescriptions from the same physician (G.A.B.,
unpublished data, May 1, 2017).
Conclusions
Between 2001 and 2014, 10.6% of commercially insured adults
with depression who started taking an antidepressant simul-
taneously started benzodiazepine therapy, with approxi-
mately twice the proportion simultaneous starting benzodi-
azepine treatment by the end of the study period. No clinically
meaningful difference was observed in antidepressant treat-
ment continuation in simultaneous new users compared with
non–simultaneous new users. Because of the risks associated
with benzodiazepines and the potentially modifiable factors
associated with long-term use among simultaneous new us-
ers, the decision to simultaneously initiate benzodiazepine
therapy at antidepressant therapy initiation and the benzodi-
azepineregimenrequirecarefulconsiderationofpotentialben-
efits and harms.
