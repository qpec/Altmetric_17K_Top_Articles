The molecular mechanism that determines under physiological conditions transmissibility of
the most common human prion disease, sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is
unknown. We report the synthesis of new human prion from the recombinant human prion
protein expressed in bacteria in reaction seeded with sCJD MM1 prions and cofactor,
ganglioside GM1. These synthetic human prions were infectious to transgenic mice expres-
sing non-glycosylated human prion protein, causing neurologic dysfunction after 459 and
224 days in the first and second passage, respectively. The neuropathology, replication
potency, and biophysical profiling suggest that a novel, particularly neurotoxic human prion
strain was created. Distinct biological and structural characteristics of our synthetic human
prions suggest that subtle changes in the structural organization of critical domains, some
linked to posttranslational modifications of the pathogenic prion protein (PrPSc), play a crucial
role as a determinant of human prion infectivity, host range, and targetting of specific brain
structures in mice models.

uman prions cause invariably fatal, rapidly progressive
neurodegenerative diseases, formerly called transmissible
spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs)1,2. Approximately
90% of human prion diseases are sporadic, 10% are associated
with pathogenic mutations in PRNP gene, and 1% is caused by
zoonotic or iatrogenic prion infection. Despite relatively low
frequency of transmitted human prion diseases, they have gained
considerable importance due to their long incubation time and
high resistance of human prions to inactivation, posing unpre-
cedented and challenging problems to disease control and public
health3. These invariably fatal neurodegenerations are caused by a
pathogenic protein, PrPSc4, which is a misfolded isoform of the
normal cellular prion protein5–11, PrPC. Human prions exist as a
broad spectrum of strains corresponding to at least eight diverse
clinicopathological disease phenotypes; may undergo mutation
and further evolution12. High-resolution structure of human
prions and the mechanism of their formation as well as
remarkably precise anatomical targetting to different brain
structures remain unknown. Many basic concepts in prion
research (including that of prion strains) as well as the current
strategies for therapeutic interventions were based on studies with
laboratory rodent prions. Even though these studies have pro-
vided fundamentally important insights, the lessons from these
studies do not apply directly to human prion diseases, as evi-
denced, for example, by several recently failed clinical trials13–15.
One of the key reasons behind these disappointing results are
fundamental differences between human prions causing diseases
such as sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) and cloned
laboratory prions16. In particular, our recent experiments indicate
that replication of sCJD prions is principally determined by
growth rate of prion aggregates that is in turn controled by their
specific structural features, and not by their confromational sta-
bility, as it is in yeast and some murine prions16. How these
aspects impact transmissibility of prions to man is an imperative
question in light of history of iatrogenic and zoonotic transmis-
sions and recent findings of human prions in the skin and body
fluids17,18.
A number of recent studies have demonstrated that infectious
rodent prions can be generated in vitro from bacterially expressed
recombinant mouse or Syrian hamster PrP19–23, and the infec-
tivity titer of some of these preparations was very high19,21. These
studies played a fundamentally important role in providing the
ultimate proof for the protein-only hypothesis of prion dis-
eases21,22,24–27. However, attempts to generate infectious syn-
thetic human prions have not yet been successful, hindering
efforts to comprehensive understanding of human prion diseases
such as sCJD. Here we bridge this gap, showing that human
prions can be synthesized in vitro from bacterially expressed
recombinant human PrP in a reaction seeded with sCJD MM1
prions in the presence of a novel cofactor, ganglioside GM1.
These synthetic human prions appear to have unique strain
properties. By comparing the structural organization of these
synthetic human prions with that of parent sCJD MM1 prions
and noninfectious human prion protein amyloid, we have iden-
tified domains in PrP that are important for the initiation of
replication in vivo, i.e. their infectivity, and for targetting of dif-
ferent anatomical brain structures. These structural and func-
tional
insights
provide
a
foundation
for
more
complete
understanding of the molecular basis of human prion formation
and propagation.
Results
Generation of recombinant human prions. Using our 96-well
plate-formatted quaking-induced conversion (QuIC) and the
recombinant
human
full-length
prion
protein
[huPrP
(23–231,129 M)] substrate16,28,29, we first systematically screened
a broad range of experimental conditions (temperature, time,
recHuPrP concentration, different cofactors) for the seeded and
unseeded conformational conversion reactions (Supplementary
Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4). The use of conformation-dependent
immunoassay (CDI) and conformational stability assay (CSA)
gave us an opportunity to monitor not only the amount of the
conversion product, but also to screen the conformational fidelity
of the conversion reactions by comparing the conformational
stability of each reaction product with that of the seed. The
selection criteria for the conversion products to be used in the
subsequent bioassay experiments were as follows: minimized
spontaneous conversion in the absence of the seed, high yield of
the conversion reaction, and similarity of conformational stability
of the product and the seed. As shown in Supplementary Table 3
and Supplementary Fig. 1, in the presence of sCJD MM1 seed the
reaction performed at 37 °C in a PBS (pH 6.9) containing 0.1%
(w/w) Triton X100, 0.7 mM monosialoganglioside (GM1), and
0.02 mM polyadenylic acid (PolyA) was characterized both by
high amplification rate as well as the final product showing
conformational stability essentially identical to that of the original
sCJD MM1 prion seed. Interestingly, the most efficient cofactor
for amplification of sCJD MM2 prions to conformationally
similar replicas was not GM1 but another lipid, 1-palmitoyl-2-
oleolyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho(1’-rac-glycerol)
(Supplementary
Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1b, Supplementary Tables 1, 2, 3,
and 4).
Based on these data, and given that sCJD MM1 prions are
known to replicate in transgenic mice much more efficiently than
the MM2 conterparts30–32, we selected for further studies
recombinant PrP replicas generated in the reaction seeded with
sCJD MM1 prions in the presence of GM1. Importantly, no
spontaneous (i.e., non-seeded) zconversion of recHuPrP was
observed under the same experimental conditions (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1a). First, we analyzed these replicas by far-UV circular
dichroism spectroscopy (Fig. 1a), finding that they are character-
ized by high content of β-sheet structure (~41% vs. 3% for PrP
monomer in the native conformation). Since the starting brain
concentrations and purification yelds of sCJD PrPSc are very low
(~200-fold lower compared to rodent PrPSc), no high quality CD
spectrum could be obtained for the seed. Neverthelless, the
content of β-structure in the recombinant PrP sCJD replicas is
similar to that previously reported for rodent prions5.
To further examine the degree of structural fidelity of the
replication of sCJD MM1 prions using the recombinant PrP
substrate and our present experimental conditions, we used two
mass spectrometry-based methods: histidine hydrogen/deuterium
exchange mass spectrometry (His-HXMS) and backbone amide
hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry
(HXMS). These methods have been shown to be uniquely well
suited for structural analysis of not only recombinant PrP
aggregates but also brain-derived PrPSc 16,33-36.
His-HXMS monitors water accessibility of individual His side
chains37,
providing
residue-specific
information
about
the
packing and interfaces between β-sheets in ordered protein
aggregates16,33,36. As shown in Fig. 1b, four out of five His
residues in the PK-resistant region are characterized by distinct
environments in brain-derived sCJD MM1 PrPSc and its
recombinant PrP replica, as indicated by substantial differences
in the rate of H/D exchange for C2 protons in histidine imidazole
rings. This clearly indicates distinct packing arrangements within
the two types of PrP aggregates examined. Structural differences
between sCJD MM1 PrPSc seeds and recombinant PrP products
of the conversion reaction are further indicated by HXMS studies
that probe the rate of H/D exchange of the backbone amide
hydrogens33–36,38. These structural differences are particularly

 pronounced in the region between residues ~117 and 144. Peptic
fragments from this region in the recombinant PrP product show
substantially higher degree of H/D exchange compared to that in
the sCJD MM1 seed already after 5 min of incubation in D2O
(Fig. 1c), and these differences become even more dramatic after
longer incubation times. Indeed, in the recombinant PrP product
this region shows more than 65% exchange after 24 h, whereas in
brain PrPSc it remains highly protected even after 10 days of
incubation in D2O (Fig. 1d). By contrast, the region between
residues ~182 and 205 appears to be less prone to deuterium
labeling (and thus more ordered) in the recombinant PrP product
than in the brain-derived sCJD MM1 seed. Altogether, these data
demonstrate that, in the presence of GM1 as a cofactor, sCJD
MM1
prions
can
efficiently
seed
the
conversion
of
the
recombinant PrP to β-sheet-rich aggregates. However, the
structure of this product is not identical to that of the seed.
One
of
the
factors
contributing
to
apparently
imperfect
conformational fidelity of this seeded conversion reaction could
be the lack of post-tranlational modifications (GPI anchor,
glycosylation of Asn residues) in the recombinant PrP substrate
used.
Bioassays of recombinant replicas of human prions. To test the
infectivity of the recombinant PrP replicas of sCJD MM1 prions,
we performed ten rounds of QuIC (all in the presence of polyA
and GM1), initially seeded with 0.1% brain homogenate of sCJD
MM1 human brain. The initial reaction concentration of seed
PrPSc was 0.126 ng/ml and recombinant PrP 0.1 mg/ml, corre-
sponding to the seed/substrate mass ratio ~1:1,000,000. Each
subsequent nine rounds were seeded with 10-fold diluted product
from the previous round, resulting in a cumulative 10−13 dilution
of the original brain prions and PrPSc seed to 0.1 ag of PrPSc, an
amount ~100,000 times below one infectious dose unit of sCJD
prions39 (Fig. 2a). Even though the conditions were the same in
all cycles, the conformational stability of the reaction products
shifted gradualy in each cycle, with Gdn HCl concentration
corresponding to the midpoint denaturation moving from 3.06 M
for the original sCJD MM1 PrPSc to 2.56 M for the reaction
product after 10 rounds of QuIC (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, less
cooperative conformational transition was observed with an
increase in the number of QuIC rounds. We interpret these
observations as indicative of a broadening of the spectrum of
conformers with lower average stability than that of the original
seed.
We inoculated with the amplified material transgenic mice
Tg40 that express human PrP(129 M) with native prostransla-
tional modifications (i.e., glycosylation of Asn residues and the
GPI anchor)40 as well as transgenic mice TgNN6h that express
human PrP(129 M) in which glycosylation was abolished by
N181Q and N197Q substitutions12. The latter line of transgenic
mice was selected for high levels of cell surface expression of
unglycosylated PrPC after monitoring white blood cells by FACS
in founder’s mice. Even though it is known that glycosylation
per se has no effect on the 3D structure of PrP41, we further
verified that the N181Q and N197Q substitutions do not affect
the overall folding of the protein. Indeed, recombinant wild-type
and mutant proteins show indistinguishable far-UV CD spectra
and are characterized by essentially identical thermodynamic
stability (Supplementary Fig. 2). It was also verified that the
N181Q/N197Q PrPC in TgNN6h mice is cell-surface expressed
and contains the GPI anchor (as indicated by immunochemical

 examination of brain tissue and the release of PrPC into Tx114
aqueous phase upon PIPLC treatment (Supplementary Fig. 3)42.
While no disease was observed in Tg40 mice inoculated with the
recombinant PrP replica of sCJD MM1 prions, clinical symptoms
of prion disease were observed in 60% of TgNN6h mice
inoculated with the same preparation, with an average incubation
time of 459 days (Table 1). In control experiments it was verified
that brain-derived sCJD MM1 prions (used as a seed in our
conversion reaction in vitro) triggered disease in both TgNN6h
and Tg40 lines, with incubation times of ~417 days and ~169 days,
respectively. Neither β-sheet-rich aggregates generated without
seeds according to the previously published protocol35, nor native
monomers of recHuPrP induced clinical symptoms, and the
neuropathology of aged-matched Tg40 and TgNN6h mice
showed no abnormalities or deposition of pathogenic prion
protein
(Table
1).
The
conformational
stability
of
PrPSc
accumulating in Tg40 mice inoculated with sCJD MM1 prions
matched the stability of the PrPSc in the inoculum. By contrast,
the stability of PrPSc accumulating in the brains of TgNN6h mice
inoculated with the same inoculum was significantly reduced, as
indicated by lower value of [Gdn HCl]1/2 (Fig. 2b). TgNN6h mice
inoculated with the recombinant replica of MM1 sCJD prions
accumulated PrPSc characterized by biphasic denaturation curves,
with ~60% of conformers having stability similar to that of PrPSc
in sCJD-infected mice and ~40% having higher stability (Fig. 2b).
Importantly, all TgNN6h mice inoculated with brain homogenate
from the first passage of recombinant PrP prion replicas
(rhuPrion) developed clinical symptoms, with the average
incubation time of 224 days (Table 1; Fig. 2c). A particularly
intriguing phenomenon was observed in the second passage of

 sCJD MM1 prions in TgNN6h mice, as these mice clearly
segregated into two distinct groups: one with the average
incubation time of 162 days (denoted sCJD-S, where S stands
for slow) and the second one with the average incubation time of
80 days (denoted sCJD-F, where F stands for fast) (Table 1;
Fig. 2c). Cumulatively, these experiments indicate that: glycosyla-
tion of the host PrPC is important for conformational fidelity of
sCJD prions replication in vivo, unglycosylated host PrPC
provides an efficient substrate for the replication of synthetic
human prions (rhuPrions) generated from an unglycosylated
recombinant prion protein, and sCJD prions can propagate in
mice expressing unglycosylated PrPC as two distinct strains, one
of which is characterized by a remarkably short incubation time.
Such subclonining of a single human prion isolate into two or
more distinct strains has been described previously in transgenic
mice30,32 as well as in cell cultures43 and led to the notion that
wild prion isolates actually consist of a mixture (“cloud”) of
diverse molecular assemblies10. Whether this strain heterogeneity
observed in the present study is at least partly related to the Asn
to Gln substitutions positions 181 and 197 necessary to eliminate
the two N-linked glycosylation sites on human PrP is not known.
However, these amino acid substitutions are generally considered
as highly conservative, and circullar dichroism (CD) spectroscopy
data indicate no conformational impact on PrPC (Supplementary
Fig. 2).
In the second passage of rhuPrions in TgNN6h mice, these
mice accumulated ~5 and 15-fold more PrPSc than mice infected
with sCJD-F and sCJD-S strains, respectively, and the same
trends were observed for proteinase-resistant PrPSc (rPrPSc)
(Fig. 2d). Different denatured/native (D/N) ratios of PrPSc
antibody epitopes (3F4 epitopes 108–112 and 8H4 epitope
175–185) indicate that they are variably exposed in the native
state of mice inoculated with different inocula, confirming
distinct conformations as detected by CSA (Fig. 2d). Further-
more, Western blot typing with a set of differentiating antibodies
revealed that TgNN6h mice inoculated with rhuPrions accumu-
lated Type 1 rPrPSc, whereas those inoculated with sCJD-S and
sCJD-F prions accumulate Type 1 and Type 2 rPrPSc, respectively
(Fig. 2e). While PrPSc from sCJD-F strain shows CSA profiles
superimposable with those for the original human brain-derived
sCJD MM1 PrPSc, the nearly superimposable CSA profiles of
PrPSc in rhuPrions and sCJD-S prions shifted to the lower
stability (Table 1; Fig. 2f). We conclude from these observations
that inoculation with rhuPrions leads to the accumulation of very
high levels of PrPSc with distinct Type 1 conformational
characteristics and stability, whereas the original sCJD MM1
prions cloned in TgNN6h into two isolates, one with short
incubation time and Type 2 rPrPSc conformers and the other one
with long incubation time and Type 1 rPrPSc.
Comparative
neuropathology
of
rhuPrion.
Three
distinct
vacuolization profiles for TgNN6h mice inoculated with rhuPrion
and original MM1 sCJD prions were indentified. The rhuPrion
pattern exceeded the vauolization profiles of both subclones of
MM1 sCJD prions, most prominently in the cortex, hippo-
campus, subiculum, basal ganglia, and hypothalamus. These
distinct lesion profiles found in rhuPrion-inoculated TgNN6h
mice were preserved upon second passage (Fig. 3a, b, c), indi-
cating that rhuPrion represents a stable strain that is distinct from
two subclones of the original sCJD MM1 prions. Remarkably,
both in the first and second passage, CA3 pyramidal layer cells of
hippocampus were completely destroyed and replaced by con-
fluent vacuoles. Some of the vacuoles were proximal to large
deposits of PrPSc and appeared reminiscent of florid plaques
found in vCJD cases. The same hypocampal structures were
either intact in sCJD-S subclone or all hypocampal formation
structures were affected indiscriminately in sCJD-F subclone
(Fig. 3a, b). Moreover, the first and second passage of rhuPrion
led to widespread thioflavin S positive plaques of PrPSc, most
prominently in the hippocampus and cortex (Fig. 3c, d). In
contrast, sCJD-F clone was characterized by fine, evenly dis-
tributed deposits of PrPSc with synaptic-like pattern, and the
infection with sCJD-S prion clone resulted in small preamyloid
deposits of PrPSc in the hippocampus and in the cortex. These
data indicate that rhuPrions represent a distinct human prion
strain that, apart from cortex and other gray matter, specifically
targets cells in the CA3 pyramidal layer of hippocampus and
leads to the accumulation of high levels of PrPSc forming amyloid
plaques in the hippocampus and cortex.
Second passage rhuPrions from TgNN6h mice brains could be
replicated in vitro by protein misfolding cyclic amplification using
Tg40 mice brain homogenate as a substrate. The replication rate
was paradoxically lower for sCJD-F subclone, and both rhuPrion
and sCJD-S replicated with comparable rates (Fig. 4a). These
results indicate that unglycosylated prions present in TgNN6h
isolates, including rhuPrions, can be replicated using fully
posttranslationally processed normal human PrPC substrate.

 prion isolates in RT QuIC with SHa(PrP90-231) (Fig. 4b) and
with Bv(23–231) (Fig. 4c) substrates indicates that rhuPrion has a
seeding titer ~100-fold and 1000-fold higher compared to sCJD-S
and sCJD-F prions, respectively. Since the concentration of PrPSc
in rhuPrions brain homogenates was only ~twofold higher than
that of PrPSc in sCJD-S and sCJD-F homogenates (Fig. 4a), this
remarkably high seeding potency suggest that rhuPrion is
composed of unique conformers with exceptionally high capacity
to convert PrP monomers into Thioflavin-positive β-sheet
aggregates. The nonequlibrium sedimentation velocity profile of
rhuPrion and both sCJD isolates were simillar, with the highest
concentration of PrPSc in the botom of the tubes (Fig. 4d, e, f).
Based on previous calibration29, we estimate that the prevalevant
population of aggregates in rhuPrions has a mass of at least
14 × 106 Da, which corresponds to at least 600 monomers of
PrPSc.
Discussion
The pathogenic conformer of human prion protein—PrPSc—is an
essential and possibly the only constituent of infectious human
prions.. However, a high-resolution structure of human PrPSc is
lacking, and the molecular mechanism that determine initiation
and propagation under physiological conditions—prion infectiv-
ity—remain obscure16,44. Our present study demonstrates, for the
first time, that infectious human prion can be generated in vitro

 from the bactrially expressed recombinant human prion protein
in a reaction seeded with brain-derived sCJD prions. Further-
more, our experiments reveal that, even though many conditions
are conductive to efficient propagation of PrP aggrergates in vitro
upon seeding with human prions, they do not always cause the
development of prion disease in vivo. The infectivity and
pathogeneicity, as well as specific targetting of neurons in dif-
ferent brain stuctures in vivo apear to be controled by by see-
mingly subtle differences in the conformation, especially in the C-
terminal domain that of PrP that is involved in posttranslational
modifications.
Although the infectivity of the herein described new artificial
prion in the first passage was relatively low and limitted to the
transgenic mice line expressing unglycosylated human PrP, the
bioassay revealed a particularly destructive neuropathological
phenotype with widspread vacuolization and loss of neurons,
particularly in the CA3 (Cornu Ammonis) region of hippo-
campus, and numerous Thioflavin S-positive plaques. The CA3
region has attracted major attention in recent years for its specific
role in memory processes and in susceptibility to seizures, and the
synthetic human prion offers a new powerful tool to study the
pathophysiology of neurodegeneration in this area, especially
relevant to Alzheimer’s disease. While these intriguing findings
may suggest generally lower fidelity of in vitro replication of brain
derived prions with unglycosylated substrate, another possibility
is that posttanslational modification of prion protein—glycosy-
lation
and
glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)
anchor—are
important determinants of conformational fidelity in serial pro-
pagation in vitro and also in the transmissibility (infectibility) of
prions in vivo45. Even though some aspects of the latter possi-
bility have recently been suggested based on experiments with
cell-adapted prions and rodent prion strains43,46,47, to fully under-
stand the impact of postranslational modifications on the struc-
tural fidelity of human prion replication to the infectious form, it
will be critical to perform a structural and functional comparison
of conversion reactions using recombinant PrP substrates in

 The discovery of variable glycosylation patterns and heritable
polymorphic PK cleavage sites of human brain PrPSc markedly
differentiated early on human prions from cloned laboratory
prions of animal origin48–50. The subsequent experiments with
more sensitive biophysical tools revealed a wide spectrum of sCJD
PrPSc structural states and interplay with distinct glycosylation
patterns in each clinicopathological category of human prion
diseases, and argued for a broad spectrum of human prion strains
coding for different phenotypes29,51,52. Moreover, our most
recent data demonstrate that typical human prions causing
sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) differ in a major way
from both cloned laboratory prions and synthetic prion amy-
loids16. Importantly, phenotypically very distant MM1 and
MM2 sCJD prions differ in their structural organization, speci-
fically in the polypeptide beckbone and quaternary structure
(packing) of prion particles. These unique structural features
primarilly control the replication rate of human prions16. Finaly,
our in vitro data reported here suggest that this aspect is in turn
controlled (probably kinetically) by strain-specific auxiliary
molecules differentially facilitating conversion reactions of some
prion strains but not others.
The existence of auxiliary molecules facilitating PrPSc forma-
tion and replication was first suggested from the co-purification
of Syrian hamster PrPSc with sphingolipids, galactosylceramide,
and sphingomyelin53, and with 25-mer polynucleotides encoding
variable sequences39. This hypothesis was supported more
recently by the findings that the PMCA conversion of purified
brain-derived PrPC to infectious conformers could be accom-
plished only in the presence of polyanions such as RNA or in a
case of recombinant PrP with RNA and synthetic lipids19,54. As a
starting point for our sCJD prions (MM1 and MM2)-seeded
conversion reactions, we used QuIC in the presence of polyA,
Monosialoganglioside GM1 from bovine brain (GM1), or syn-
thetic
2-Oleoyl-1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-(1-gly-
cerol) (POPG). While the replication and conformational fidelity
of MM1 sCJD prions was facilitated by GM1, MM2 sCJD was
facilitated by POPG. Considering structural and charge hetero-
geneity of gangliosides, and their localization together with PrPC
in cholesterol rich domains (caveoli), their distinct characteristics
and levels in different cells may explain preferential cellular tar-
getting of different human prions and thus distinct neuropatho-
logical profiles. These results support a critical role of cofactors in
the strain-specific formation and propagation of human prions,
and suggest that different cofactors guide human PrP misfolding
in distinct pathways, resulting in different prions. However,
whether additional cofactors can also facilitate strain-specific
replication of human prions is at present unknown and these
initial observations have to be extended with screenining of
additional cofactors. The obvious potential candidates are phos-
phatidylglycerol or phosphatidylethanolamine alone, as these
cofactors have been shown to facilitate PMCA conversion of
bacterially expressed mouse PrP to highly infectious prions26,54,55.
Additional human prion strain-specific cofactors can be poten-
tially identified by analysis of nonproteinaceous molecules asso-
ciated with purified human prions employing a strategy similar to
that used previously for identification of rodent prion cofactors56–
58. These investigations could open new therapeutic strategies for
human prion disease by designing synthetic analogs of auxiliary
factors with inhibitory or blocking effect on human prion
replication.
Methods
Ethics statement. All procedures were performed under protocols approved by
the Institutional Review Board at Case Western Reserve University. In all cases,
written informed consent for research was obtained from the patient or legal
guardian and the material used had appropriate ethical approval for use in this
project. All patient data and samples were coded and handled according to NIH
guidelines to protect patient identities. All animal studies were conducted under
the protocols approved by Case Western Reserve University Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Patients and clinical evaluations. Prion disease cases were reviewed pertaining to
updated diagnostic criteria for sCJD59. Brain MRIs were considered positive for
CJD if the reading by experienced radiologist fulfilled the criteria defined
peviously27.
The criteria for inclusion were availability of a clinical diagnosis of CJD
according to WHO criteria59–62 with dated initial symptoms to ascertain the
disease duration; methionine or valine at codon 129 of the human prion protein
(PrP) gene (PRNP); unequivocal classification of Type 1, Type 2, or Type 1–2
rPrPSc sCJD according to Western blot (WB) pattern; and unequivocal
classification of pathology as definite Type 1, Type 2, or mixed Type 1–263,64. The
criteria for diagnosis of rapidly progressive Alzheimer disease (AD)63 were as
follows: probable clinical diagnosis of AD63,65; absent autosomal dominant pattern
of dementia; unequivocal classification as AD after detailed neuropathology and
immunohistochemistry of tau proteins and amyloid beta using the current
National Institute of Aging—Alzheimer’s Association guidelines63,66.
CJD Classification, brain samples, and PRNP gene sequencing. DNA was
extracted from frozen brain tissues in all cases, and genotypic analysis of the PRNP
coding region was performed as described39,67,68. The CJD cases were classified on
the basis of diagnostic pathology, immunohistochemistry, and WB examination of
2 or 3 brain regions (including frontal, occipital and cerebellum cortices) with mAb
3F43,12,29,52.
For molecular analyses, we used 200–350 mg cuts of frontal (superior and more
posterior middle gyri) brain cortex stored at −80 °C after autopsy. The other
cerebral hemisphere was fixed in formalin and 16 anatomical areas were used for
histopathological and immunohistochemical classification of prion disease
according NPDPSC’s standard protocols3,23,69. In a case of equivocal classification
of sCJD subtype between pathology and Western blots, we based the classification
on the molecular characteristics of PrPSc on Western blots developed with a panel
of Type 1 and Type 2-specific antibodies as described previously3,70,71.
Bioassays in transgenic mice expressing human PrPC (129M). The human
PrPN181Q/N197Q ORF, which contains 2 point mutations that change Asn to Gln in
amino acid positions 181 and 197, thereby eliminating the two N-linked glycosy-
lation sites on human PrP, was generated by PCR mutagenesis from the human
PrP-129M transgene construct used for the generation of the Tg40 mice and
described previously40. The homozygous TgNN6h line expressing the human
PrPN181Q/N197Q ORF at about 60% of the PrP level found in wild type FVB mice
was described previously12. To assay for prion infectivity in the TgNN6h mice, 30
µl of the sample (brain homogenates or recombinanat human PrP preparations
before or after QuIC) in PBS was injected into the mouse brain with a 26 gauge
needle inserted to a depth of about 4 mm at the left parietal region of the cranium
and the symptoms monitored as described previously40. To prevent cross con-
tamination, the intracerebral inoculations of synthetic prions were performed
under sterile conditions in days when no other inoculations where carried out. The
animals were housed in microisolator cages and stringent aseptic and biosafety
techniques were followed for animal handling and husbandry as we described
previously40. Within three days after the appearance of symptoms or at death, the
animal was euthanized and the brain was removed; one-half was frozen for bio-
chemical studies, and the other half was stored in formalin for histology and
immunohistochemistry analysis as described below.
The sCJD brain homogenates. We selected brain samples from a group of sCJD
patients, all of whom were methionine or valine homozygous at codon 129 of the
human prion protein (PrP) gene (PRNP), and who were classified according to
pathology and WB pattern as pure Type 1 or Type 2 sCJD at the National Prion
Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (NPDPSC) in Cleveland, OH. DNA was
extracted from frozen brain tissues in all cases, and genotypic analysis of the PRNP
coding region was performed as described67,68. All patient data and samples were
handled with IRB approval according NIH guidelines to protect patients’ identities
and the patients or their legal representatives signed written consent.
Slices of human brain tissues weighing between 200 and 350 mg from the
frontal cortex were first homogenized to a final 15% (w/v) in calcium- and
magnesium-free PBS, pH 7.4, by using Mini-Beadbeater 16 Cell Disrupter (Biospec,
Bartlesville, OK). The homogenates were then diluted to a final 10% (w/v) in PBS /
1% Triton X-100 / 5 mM EDTA / 1× Complete PI cocktail (Roche Applied Science,
Indianapolis, IN), pH 7.4. They were clarified by a centrifugation at 500×g for 5
min, and the collected supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C for QuIC.
QuIC. The QuIC was performed as described72 with following modifications. The
recombinant human PrP(23–231) with codon 129 M or 129 V used as a substrate
in QuIC were expressed, purified, and refolded to α-helical conformation as
described previously73. The initial concentration of recombinant human PrP
(23–231) was calculated from absorbance at 280 nm and molar extinction

 coefficient 56,650 M−1 cm−1. The stock of rechuPrP(23–231) in 10 mM Sodium
Acetate buffer, pH 4.0, was pretreated with 12 mM HCl at 1:5.0 (rechuHuPrP: HCl,
v/v) ratio for 7.5 min and immediately diluted to final 0.1 mg/ml into the basic

Monosialoganglioside GM1 from bovine brain (GM1, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster,
AL), or synthetic 2-Oleoyl-1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)
(POPG, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) are described in the Supplementary Tables 1, 2, 3,
and 4. The QuIC was performed with final volume 100 µl per well in sterile V-
bottom, low-binding polypropylene 96-well plate (VWR, Arlington Heights, IL)
equipped with a 3 mm diameter PTFE bead (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA) in
each well. The aliquots of sCJD brain homogenates used as seeds were sonicated
3 × 5 s at 60% power setting using Misonix Sonicator S-4000 (Qsonica, Newtown,
CT), diluted immediately into the complete QuIC reaction buffer to obtain final 10
−4 dilution of sCJD brain prions, and the plates were sealed with sterile Axymat*
Silicone Sealing Mat (VWR, Arlington Heights, IL). The QuIC was performed at
37, 45, or 55 °C for 5 to 96 h in Eppendorf Thermomixer (Eppendorf, Hauppauge,
NY) set for 1 min shaking at 1400 rpm followed by 1 min incubation. The control
unseeded samples of spontaneously converted prion protein amyloid were pre-
pared according previously published protocol35.
PK treatment. To each well containing 100 µl of QuIC reaction buffer was added
50 µl of PBS, pH 6.9, containing 3% (w/v) Sarcosyl and Proteinase K (PK, Amresco,
Solon, OH) to obtain the final Sarcosyl concentration 1% (w/v) and PrP/enzyme
ratio 10:1 (w/w) or 100:1 (w/w). The plates was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C at 1200
rpm on the Eppendorf Thermomixer with 1-min. interval. Alternatively, QuIC
reaction performed in PBS, pH 6.9 containing 0.5 M NaCl and no detergents was
followed with PK treatment without detergents. The PK was blocked in each well
with protease inhibitors (0.5 mM PMSF final, and 5 ug/ml of aprotinin and
leupeptin).
SDS PAGE and western blots. The samples were mixed 1:1 with WB (Laemmli
Buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) containing 5% (v/v) beta-mercaptoethanol (BME),
2% (v/v) SDS, and 115 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8 and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Either
150 ng (silver staining) or 2 ng (Western blots) per lane were loaded on 1 mm 18%
Polyacrylamide Tris-HCl, SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad).
SDS-PAGE gels were transblotted to Immobilon-P Transfer Membranes
(Millipore, Bedford, MA) in Bio-Rad Western Blot apparatus. The filters were
blocked with 5% (w/v) Nonfat milk in TBS containing 0.1% of Tween 20 (v/v)
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and incubated with one of the following antibodies: mAb
3F474 (epitope residue 107–112); mAb 12B2 (epitope residues 89–93, kindly
provided by Jan Langeveld75, and mAb 1E4 (epitope residues 97–108, Cell Sciences,
Canton, MA). After incubation with secondary anti-mouse IgG peroxidase-labeled
sheep Ab (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ), the membranes were developed with the
ECL Plus detection system (Amersham) and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR Films
(Fisher Scientific) or Kodak BioMax XAR Films (Fisher Scientific).
Histology and immunohistochemistry lesion profiles. We used hematoxylin and
eosin or antibody 3F4 on four different coronal sections for the histopathology and
immunohistochemical detection of PrPSc in rodent brains as reported pre-
viously39,76,77. Semiquantitative evaluation of spongiosis and gliosis was performed
by comparing hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections using a modified procedure
of Fraser and Dickinson78. Nine areas of gray matter were examined, and a score
was given for the severity of spongiform degeneration using the scale based on a
number and confluency of vacuoles in the field at 400-fold magnification: 0, no
vacuoles; 1, one to three vacuoles widely and unevenly distributed; 2, on average
ten vacuoles evenly scattered; 3, on average thirty vacuoles evenly scattered; 4, on
average 90 vacuoles with some confluences; 5, dense vacuolation with proiminent
confluence.
Thioflavin S staining. After deparaffinization, formalin-fixed sections were stained
in Thioflavin S for 7 min, washed three times in 80% alcohol, dehydrated in
ethanol, cleared in xylene, and cover slipped with Vectashield mounting medium
for fluorescence. Sections were kept in the dark at 4 ˚C for 30 min before being
viewed under the fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX71).
Conformation-dependent immunoassay (CDI). The CDI for human PrP was
performed as described previously39,79, with following modifications: white
Lumitrac 600 High Binding Plates (E&K Scientific, Santa Clara, CA) were coated
with mAb 8H4 (epitope 175–185)80 and aliquots of each sample containing 0.007%
(v/v) of Patent Blue V (Sigma) were dilutedinto plate wells filled with 200 µl of
Assay Buffer (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA); he captured PrP was detected by a
europium-conjugated81 anti-PrP mAb 3F4 (epitope 108–112)74 and the time-
resolved fluorescence (TRF) signals were measured by the multi-mode microplate
reader PHERAstar Plus (BMG LabTech, Durham, NC).
Conformational stability assay (CSA) of prions. The sequential denaturation of
human PrPSc was performed as described previously81, with several modifications.
Frozen aliquots of PrPSc were thawed, sonicated 3 × 5 s at 60% power with Soni-
cator 4000 (Qsonica, Newtown, CT); and the concentration was adjusted to con-
stant ~50 ng/ml of PrPSc or rhuPrion. The 15 µl aliquots in 15 tubes were treated
with increasing concentrations of 8 M GdnHCl containing 0.007% (v/v) Patent
Blue V (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in 0.25 M or 0.5 M increments. After 30 min
incubation at room temperature, individual tubes were rapidly diluted with Assay
Buffer (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) containing diminishing concentrations of 8
M GdnHCl, so that the final concentration in all samples was 0.411 M. Each
individual aliquot was immediately loaded in triplicates to dry white Lumitrac 600,
High Binding Plates (E&K Scientific, Santa Clara, CA), coated with mAb 8H4, and
developed in accordance with CDI protocol using europium-labeled mAb 3F4 for
detection39,81–83. The raw TRF signal was converted into the apparent fractional
change of unfolding (Fapp) as follows: Fapp = (TRFOBS- TRFN)/(TRFU-TRFN)
where TRFOBS is the observed TRF value, and TRFN and TRFU are the TRF values
for native and unfolded forms, respectively, at the given Gdn HCl concentration5.
To determine the concentration of Gdn HCl where 50% of PrPSc is unfolded ([Gdn
HCl]1/2), the data were fitted by least square method with a sigmoidal transition
model as described previously52.
Second-generation RT-QuIC. The second-generation RT-QuIC assays were per-
formed as previously described, with minor modifications18. The RT-QuIC reac-
tion mix was prepared as follows: 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 300 mM
NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml SHarPrP(23–231), 10 µM thioflavin T (ThT), 1 mM ethylene-
diaminetetraacteic acid tetrasodium salt (EDTA) and 0.002% sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS). The 85 µl of reaction mix was loaded into each plate well and seeded
with 15 µl of brain homogenates for a final reaction volume of 100 µl. The incu-
bation and real time fluorescence monitoring was performed using the FLUOstar
Omega plate reader (BMG LABTECH GmbH, Ortenberg, Germany) set to the
following parameters: 55 °C incubation, 60 h reaction time, 60 s shake/60 s rest
cycles with ThT fluorescence measurements taken every 45 min.
HXMS experiments. The pellets containing aggregates of rechuPrP after PK
treatment were washed three times in H2O. For deuterium labeling, pellets (~20 µl)
were resuspended in 400 μl of the buffer (10 mM phosphate, pH 7.0) prepared in
D2O. After incubation at room temperature for different time periods, samples
were cetrifuged at 21,000×g for 5 min and dissociated by incubating for 5 min on
ice in a quenching buffer (0.1 M phosphate, pH 2.4) containing 7 M guanidine
hydrochlorode and 0.1 M TCEP [Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride].
The samples were then diluted 10 times with an ice cold 0.05% TFA (Tri-
fluoroacetic acid) and digested for 5 min with agarose-immobilized pepsin
(Thermo Scientific). The peptic fragments were separated and analyzed by mass
spectrometry as described previously34,35.
His-HXMS experiments. For these measurements, the pellets containing aggre-
gates of rhuPrP after PK treatment (~3.6ug) were suspended in D2O buffer (10
mM sodium phosphate, pH 9.0) and incubated for 5 days at 37 °C. Following
incubation,samples were collected by centrifugation. To obtain peptide fragments
containing single His residues, the aggregates were dissociated with 7 M Gdn and
digested first with agarose-immobilized pepsin and then silica-immobilized trypsin
as descibed previously16. The peptic fragments were separated on an UPLC column
and analyzed by mass spectrometry on an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Mass
spectrometric data were analyzed and half-life (t1/2, days) of His exchange reaction
was determined as described previously16.
Statistical analysis. We compared the parameters for the whole group and dif-
ferent phenotypic subgroups with ANOVA or Fisher exact test. Cumulative sur-
vival curves were constructed by the Kaplan–Meier method and compared using
the Mantel-Cox and Breslow methods. For each type of PrPSc and PRNP codon 129
polymorphism, we report descriptive statistics and each variable was compared
with ANOVA.
