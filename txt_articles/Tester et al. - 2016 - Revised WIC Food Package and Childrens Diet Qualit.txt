abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In October 2009, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program 
for Women, Infant, and Children (WIC) food package was revised to include more fruits, 
vegetables, whole grains, and lower-fat milk. We examined the impact of the WIC food 
package revisions on the diet quality of children in households using WIC.
METHODS: A total of 1197 children aged 2 to 4 years from low-income households were studied 
from before and after the policy implementation (using the 2003–2008 and 2011–2012 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). The Healthy Eating Index–2010 (HEI-
2010) was calculated using two 24-hour diet recalls. Linear regression was used to examine 
the difference in HEI-2010 score attributable to the food package change, adjusting for 
baseline and secular trends among WIC participants and nonparticipants, as well as child 
and household characteristics. Component scores of the HEI-2010 index were analyzed with 
generalized linear models.
RESULTS: Average HEI-2010 scores for participants and nonparticipants were 52.4 and 50.0 
at baseline, and 58.3 and 52.4 after the policy change, respectively. The WIC food package 
revisions were associated with an adjusted average of 3.7 additional HEI-2010 points (95% 
confidence interval, 0.6–6.9) for WIC participants compared with nonparticipants. In 
particular, the revisions were associated with a 3.4-fold relative increase (95% confidence 
interval, 1.3–9.4) in the Greens and Beans component score for WIC participants compared 
with nonparticipants.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this national sample indicate that the WIC food package revisions 
were associated with higher diet quality for children participating in WIC.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: In 2009, the 
Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, 
Infant, and Children food package was revised. Key 
improvements included the increased provision 
of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lower-fat 
milk. Evidence thus far has been limited to regional 
samples.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study is the fi
 rst 
to report on the signifi
 cant improvements in diet 
quality in young children associated with the food 
package change using a nationally representative 
sample and the fi
 rst to do so with the updated 
Healthy Eating Index–2010.

The United States Department 
of Agriculture (USDA) Food 
and Nutrition Service Special 
Supplemental Nutrition Program for 
Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) 
is an important federal program in 
existence since 1975. It was designed 
to support the health and nutrition 
of low-income pregnant women, 
infants, and children up to the age 
of 5 years.1 In December 2007, 
the interim rule revised the WIC 
benefits package to more closely 
align with dietary recommendations 
from the Institute of Medicine, 
2 
and changes were required to be 
in effect by October 2009.3 This 
revision represented a sweeping 
change, as the WIC program had 
not changed its food package 
significantly in several decades. The 
changes to WIC included: addition of 
more fruits, vegetables, and whole 
grains; a switch toward lower fat 
milk; and a decrease in allotment 
for juice to one-half the previous 
amount. In the time since the policy 
change, there has been evidence of 
regional improvement in terms of 
healthy food availability at stores 
participating in the WIC program.4–9
There has also been evidence 
regarding positive changes in dietary 
intake according to regionally based 
data.4 Telephone surveys with 
WIC participants in California10 
and administrative records from 
millions of WIC visits in the state 
of New York11 showed increases in 
reported consumption of whole-grain 
foods and decreases in consumption 
of whole milk, with increased 
consumption of fruits and vegetables. 
This shift from whole milk to lower 
fat milk, with a concomitant decrease 
in consumption of saturated fats, 
was also reported in low-income, 
preschool-aged children in New 
Mexico.12 In another study, Hispanic 
and African-American mothers in 
Illinois were asked to report on the 
diets of their children who were 
participating in WIC. Six months 
after the policy change, there was 
a shift away from consumption of 
whole milk to lower fat milk for all 
children and greater availability of 
whole grains in the home.13 Eighteen 
months after the policy change, 
statistically significant improvements 
in diet (decreased total and saturated 
fat, increased dietary fiber, and 
overall dietary quality) was seen but 
only among Hispanic children.14
However, there have been no 
nationally representative studies 
examining the impact of this policy 
on the diets of low-income children. 
The National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) 
continuously collects household 
information and detailed 24-hour 
diet recalls on children and adults in 
the United States. Recently released 
data about WIC participation in the 
2011–2012 cycle of the NHANES 
permits comparison of diet quality by 
using the Healthy Eating Index–2010 
(HEI-2010) before and after the 
policy change to evaluate the impact 
on its intended population target. 
The HEI-2010 is an overall measure 
of diet quality with 12 components 
that are derived from diet recall data; 
this index was revised in 2012 to 
reflect the 2010 Dietary Guidelines 
for Americans.15
We hypothesized that the WIC 
package change would be associated 
with an increase in diet quality 
compared with earlier quality 
ratings. We also hypothesized that 
given the nature of the changes to 
the WIC package, there would be 
improvements in 4 specific HEI 
components: “Whole Fruit” (which, 
unlike “Total Fruit, 
” does not include 
juice); “Greens and Beans” (which 
excludes potatoes that are counted 
in “Total Vegetables”); “Whole Grains 
(as a reflection of the new whole-
grain items included in the package); 
and “Fatty Acids” (with the shift to 
lower fat milk contributing to an 
improved score).
METHODS
Study Population
We examined participants from 
the NHANES, which is a complex, 
multistage probability cross-
sectional sample designed to be 
representative of the US civilian, 
noninstitutionalized population. This 
analysis combined data from the 3 
cycles before the WIC package change 
(2003–2004, 2005–2006, and 2007–
2008) and 1 cycle that occurred fully 
after implementation (2011–2012). 
Analysis was limited to children 
from households with incomes at or 
below 185% of the federal poverty 
level (FPL) in accordance with the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services’
 poverty guidelines.16 The 
study included 1197 children who 
were aged 2 to 4 years at the time 
of the household interview, with 
complete data on household WIC 
participation and dietary intake.
Measures
Household WIC participation
WIC participation assessed at the 
level of the household was used as 
the primary predictor of interest 
for this analysis. Household WIC 
participation was assessed with the 
following single question that was 
asked throughout the entire analytic 
period of all individuals: “In the last 
12 months, did you [the child] or any 
member of the household receive 
benefits from the WIC program, 
that is, the Women, Infants and 
Children program?” For our analysis, 
this question was preferable to the 
question “Is [child] now receiving 
benefits from the WIC program?” 
because of the higher rate of missing 
data for that individual-level 
question (with which sample size 
would have been N = 768, keeping 
all other inclusion criteria). These 
children with missing data (36%) 
were significantly different from 
the 768 children with nonmissing 
data in terms of key demographic 
characteristics (eg, proportion

<100% FPL vs 100%–185% FPL, 
proportion Hispanic, proportion with 
household respondent having at least 
a high school diploma [all, P < .01]). 
These findings indicate that missing 
the child-specific WIC item was 
nonrandom and using it could lead to 
other biases in the data.
Dietary Recall Data
A 24-hour diet recall was 
conducted in-person at the mobile 
examination center with the person 
most knowledgeable about the 
child’
s dietary intake. Since 2003, 
participation has included a second 
recall conducted over the telephone 
after the in-person visit. The average 
of 2 recalls was used for this analysis. 
Overall diet quality was assessed 
by using the HEI-2010, a measure 
developed by the USDA Center for 
Nutrition Policy and Promotion, to 
measure conformance to the 2010 
Dietary Guidelines for Americans. 
The HEI-2010 score is the sum of 
12 component scores (Total Fruit, 
Whole Fruit, Total Vegetables, Greens 
and Beans, Whole Grains, Dairy, Total 
Protein Foods, Seafood and Plant 
Proteins, Fatty Acids, Refined Grains, 
Sodium, and Empty Calories), with a 
maximum score of 100 points.15 The 
MyPyramid Equivalents Database 
(for NHANES 2003–2004) and the 
Food Patterns Equivalents Database 
(for NHANES 2005 and later) convert 
foods and beverages reported in 
NHANES to USDA food pattern 
components, and they were used to 
estimate component scores for the 
HEI-2010.17
Statistical Analyses
Survey weights were used to 
account for the complex, multistage 
probability sampling design used 
in NHANES in accordance with 
recommendations from the National 
Center for Health Statistics.16, 
18 SEs 
were estimated by using jackknife 
replication. NHANES data from 
2003–2008 (3 cycles) were pooled to 
ensure a sufficient representation of 
WIC participants and income-eligible 
nonparticipants before the WIC food 
package change. To confirm the 
absence of a statistically significant 
trend in the HEI-2010 score 
during this period, adjusted linear 
regression analysis was conducted 
by using the covariates and an 
ordinal variable denoting the survey 
cycle (2003–2004, 2005–2006, and 
2007–2008). Absence of a trend in 
total HEI-2010 score was confirmed 
with P > .05 for this ordinal variable. 
For sensitivity analysis, the 2011–
2012 cycle was compared with only 
the cycle immediately before the 
intervention (2007–2008) as well 
as with the 2 previous cycles (2005–
2006 and 2007–2008).
Multivariate linear regression 
analysis was conducted to evaluate 
the associations between HEI-
2010 score and household WIC 
participation. Models were adjusted 
for the following covariates: age, 
race/ethnicity, gender, weight 
status (normal weight, overweight, 
or obese) and average total energy 
intake of the child; education (less 
than high school graduate versus 
high school graduate) and marital 
status (partnered/married versus 
single) of the household respondent; 
and the household income-to-poverty 
ratio and household food security 
status. The model included household 
WIC participation, a dichotomous 
variable denoting whether the 
survey cycle was preintervention 
(2003–2008) or postintervention 
(2011–2012), and an interaction 
term between household WIC 
participation and intervention 
period. This interaction term 
represents the “extra” association 
between household WIC and HEI-
2010 during the 2011–2012 period, 
and thus the difference in diet quality 
among WIC participants attributable 
to the food package change. 
There was skewness in the HEI-2010 
subcomponent scores. Supplemental 
Table S4 provides the medians and 
proportions with nonzero scores 
for components with at least 25% 
of children scoring zero at baseline. 
To examine changes in individual 
components of the HEI-2010, 
component scores were analyzed 
by using a generalized linear model 
(GLM), assuming a γ distribution 
and a log-link. The use of the log-
link allows us to directly model 
diet quality component scores and 
obtain interpretations in terms of 
the ratio of the relative changes 
between groups.19 The use of the 
γ distribution reflects the fact that 
the diet component data were 
nonnegative and skewed to the right. 
Models included the same variables 
as the multivariate regression model 
for the overall HEI-2010. In the GLM 
model, we interpreted the interaction 
coefficient as the log-transformed 
ratio of change in component scores 
among WIC participants compared 
with the change in component scores 
among nonparticipants.
Analyses were conducted by using 
SAS version 9.3 for HEI-2010 
calculations (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, 
NC) and Stata version 12.1 (Stata 
Corp, College Station, TX) for all other 
analyses.
RESULTS
Demographic Characteristics
Characteristics of the sample are 
shown in Table 1. There were some 
differences between WIC participants 
and nonparticipants. For WIC 
participants, a higher proportion 
were Hispanic (39.9% vs 21.8%) 
and a smaller proportion were non-
Hispanic white (30.4% vs 51.3%) 
compared with nonparticipants (P 
< .01). WIC participants were also 
less likely to have a caregiver with at 
least a high school diploma (P < .01). 
WIC participants were younger (2.9 
vs 3.1 years; P < .05) and were from 
households with lower household 
income (84% vs 106% of the FPL; 
P < .05). There were no statistically 
significant differences with respect to 
gender, total energy intake, or weight 
status of the child or with respect to

marital status or food security status 
in the household.
Overall Effect of WIC Package Change 
in HEI-2010
Of 100 points, the survey-weighted 
(unadjusted) mean HEI-2010 
score at baseline for WIC 
participants was 52.4 compared 
with 50.0 for nonparticipants. 
After the policy implementation, 
the mean HEI-2010 score was 
58.3 for WIC participants in 
2011–2012 compared with 52.4 for 
nonparticipants (Table 2).
Adjusting for child and houseold 
characteristics, the WIC food 
package revisions were significantly 
associated with 3.7 additional 
HEI-2010 points (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.6–6.9) in children in a 
WIC household compared with their 
peers. Sensitivity analyses comparing 
the postintervention period with 
smaller baseline periods found 
comparable results (3.7 points [95% 
CI, 0.5–7.0] compared with data from 
2005–2008, and 4.7 points [95% CI, 
1.0–8.5] compared with data from 
2007–2008).
Changes in Component Scores
Survey-weighted preintervention 
and postintervention means in 
components are shown in Table 3. 
The 3 components that exhibited the 
greatest relative change between 
preintervention and postintervention 
scores for WIC participants were 
Greens and Beans (in which there 
was an adjusted increase of 111%), 
Whole Grains (adjusted increase 
of 64%), and Fatty Acids (adjusted 
increase of 47%) (data not shown). 
For nonparticipants, the component 
with the greatest relative change was 
Greens and Beans (in which there 
was an adjusted 38% decrease [data 
not shown]).
The interaction term in our GLM 
model, after exponentiation, 
represented the ratio of the changes 
in component scores among 
WIC participants compared with 
nonparticipants. This ratio was 
statistically significant for Greens 
and Beans (3.4 [95% CI, 1.3–9.4]), 
meaning that the change in Greens 
and Beans score for WIC participants 
after the policy change was 3.4 times 
greater than the corresponding 
change in nonparticipants. The 
adjusted increases in component

scores for WIC participants 
(compared with nonparticipants) 
were 56% greater for Whole Grains 
and 32% greater for Fatty Acids, but 
these potentially positive findings 
did not reach statistical significance 
in this sample (P =0.08 and P = 0.06, 
respectively).
DISCUSSION
The findings from the present 
analysis suggest that revisions to the 
WIC package in 2009 were associated 
with a significant improvement 
in diet quality among children 
participating in this program across 
the United States. Using rigorous 
methods of dietary assessment and 
a nationally representative sample 
from NHANES, our study results are 
consistent with earlier findings from 
regional studies.4, 
10, 
12–14
It has been shown that WIC 
participation is associated with 
better nutrient intake among 
preschool-aged children compared 
with their peers who are also from 
low-income households.20–22 In this 
analysis, children in WIC households 
between 2003 and 2008 had a diet 
quality score that was higher than 
that of their peers by >2 points. 
These findings suggest that even 
after taking into account the more 
favorable baseline diet quality among 
WIC participants, as well as secular 
changes, the policy change was 
associated with nearly 4 additional 
points in score. Thus, the amplitude 
of impact from this change was 
even greater than the differential 
between WIC participants and their 
peers at baseline, suggesting that 
the impact of the WIC policy change 
has not been trivial. This finding was 
consistent when various baseline 
periods were used as the reference 
group, suggesting that the dietary 
improvement observed in the 
postintervention period was robust.
These findings suggest that the WIC 
package change in particular was 
associated with an increase in Greens 
and Beans scores during a time when 
consumption seemed to decrease for 
children not participating in WIC. 
Although the WIC fruit and vegetable 
voucher can ultimately supply only 
a modest number of servings of 
green vegetables in a given calendar 
month, this small dollar amount 
appeared to have, for many children 
in the WIC program, translated into 
consumption of “some instead of 
none.”
Whole Grains scores were low 
for both WIC participants and 
nonparticipants at baseline, and 
package revisions specifically 
targeted increasing consumption of 
whole grains. Although there was a 
modest increase for nonparticipants, 
the change was much larger among 
WIC participants. These results 
are consistent with findings from a 
study evaluating scanner data from 
a supermarket chain, which showed 
that WIC-participating households 
seemed to be purchasing whole-grain 
bread instead of white bread.23
The WIC package change also 
included a shift toward offering 
lower fat milk, and previous studies 
demonstrated a favorable effect on 
children’
s saturated fat intake that 
may be attributable to this 
change.10, 
12–14, 
23 Dairy intake was 
high at baseline, and did not go 
down with the mandated shift in the 
kind of milk offered. Of note, Fatty 
Acids scores increased more for WIC 
participants than for nonparticipants, 
presumably due to substitutions 
away from high-fat milk. Future 
analyses including more waves of 
participants after the policy change 
will add statistical power and more 
confident analysis of these trends.

Model was adjusted for the following covariates: age, race/ethnicity, gender, and weight status and energy intake of the child; education and marital status of the household respondent; 
and household income-to-poverty ratio and household food security status. The model included household WIC participation, a variable denoting preintervention versus postintervention 
period, and an interaction between WIC and intervention period.

The WIC package change 
included incentive for 
purchases of fruits as well, and 
a hypothesized outcome would 
also have been an increase in 
fruit consumption. However, WIC 
participants did not significantly 
increase their Whole Fruit 
component scores more than 
nonparticipants. Mean scores 
suggest a trend toward a greater 
percent increase in the whole fruit 
component score (which does not 
include juice) than the total fruit 
score (which includes juice). A 
larger sample including a greater 
proportion of children after the 
policy change will be required to 
examine this trend more fully.
Strengths of the present study 
include its use of nationally 
representative data on both 
WIC participants as well as 
nonparticipants to examine the 
impact of this federal policy change. 
To the best of our knowlege, it is 
the first study evaluating the impact 
of WIC changes on children’
s diet 
quality using the most updated 
version of the HEI-2010 instead 
of the earlier Healthy Eating 
Index–2005 with its outdated diet 
quality ratings. Limitations are that 
findings from this cross-sectional 
population data cannot be used to 
describe changes at the individual 
level; longitudinal data would 
be required for such an analysis. 
Although the dietary methodology 
used by NHANES is state-of-the-art 
for this purpose, there are known 
limitations with diet recall data. 
For example, it is possible that 
caregivers, because of desirability 
bias, reported intakes that were 
more favorable than accurate.24, 
25 
However, this scenario would 
have been true at any time point 
and would not have differentially 
affected the report of children’
s 
dietary intake specifically after 
the policy implementation. Our 
analytic approach relies on the 
general assumption that, aside 
from the revisions outlined in the 
WIC package change, there were no 
systematic revisions that occurred 
to WIC participants, but not to 
nonparticipants, during the study 
period, or vice versa. However, 
although there were clear factors 
that would have affected low-income 
families during the study period, 
including the Great Recession in 
2008, we have no reason to suspect 
that there were systematic changes 
other than the WIC package revision 
that would have affected WIC 
participants differentially from their 
peers.
CONCLUSIONS
The federal WIC food package was 
revised in 2009 to offer participants 
in low-income households healthy 
foods that better aligned with the 
Dietary Guidelines for Americans. 
Results from this nationally 
representative sample show that 
our nation’
s children participating 
in the WIC program have seen 
improvements in the quality of their 
diet as a result of the 2009 WIC 
policy changes.
