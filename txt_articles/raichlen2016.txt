Abstract
Objectives: Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is a
strong predictor of cardiovascular health, yet few humans living in industrialized
societies meet current recommendations (150 min/week). Researchers have long sug-
gested that human physiological requirements for aerobic exercise reflect an
evolutionary shift to a hunting and gathering foraging strategy, and a recent transition
to more sedentary lifestyles likely represents a mismatch with our past in terms of
physical activity. The goal of this study is to explore this mismatch by characterizing
MVPA and cardiovascular health in the Hadza, a modern hunting and gathering pop-
ulation living in Northern Tanzania.
Methods: We measured MVPA using continuous heart rate monitoring in 46 partici-
pants recruited from two Hadza camps. As part of a larger survey of health in the
Hadza, we measured blood pressure (n 5 198) and biomarkers of cardiovascular
health (n 5 23) including C-reactive protein, cholesterol (Total, HDL, and LDL), and
triglycerides.
Results: We show that Hadza participants spend large amounts of time in MVPA
(134.926 8.6 min/day), and maintain these activity levels across the lifespan. In fact,
the Hadza engage in over 14 times as much MVPA as subjects participating in large
epidemiological studies in the United States. We found no evidence of risk factors
for cardiovascular disease in this population (low prevalence of hypertension across
the lifespan, optimal levels for biomarkers of cardiovascular health).
Conclusions: Our results provide evidence that the hunting and gathering foraging
strategy involves high levels of MVPA, supporting the evolutionary medicine model
for the relationship between MVPA and cardiovascular health.

INTRODUCTION
Regular aerobic physical activity is a key element of a
healthy lifestyle and is known to prevent disease, enhance
well-being, and increase lifespan (Garber et al., 2011; War-
burton, Nicol, & Bredin, 2006). In addition, time spent
physically inactive is a major risk factor for cardiovascular
disease, metabolic disorders, and all-cause mortality (Eke-
lund et al., 2015; Garber et al., 2011), and is a key driver of
health care costs in the United States (Carlson, Fulton, Pratt,
Yang, & Adams, 2015). The effects of exercise on health are
not simply due to reductions in obesity, which is traditionally

 identified as a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality
(Ekelund et al., 2015; Myers et al., 2015). Results from an
epidemiological study of over 300,000 Europeans suggest
that low levels of physical activity (PA) may be responsible
for twice as many deaths as obesity (Ekelund et al., 2015).
Human physiology seems to require modest amounts of aer-
obic exercise to maintain healthy organ systems.
Researchers have suggested that an evolutionary history
that included a highly aerobically active hunting and gather-
ing lifestyle may be responsible for both the physiological
benefits of an active lifestyle and the dangers of more seden-
tary living (Cordain, Gotshall, Eaton, & Eaton, 1998; Eaton
& Eaton, 2003; Eaton, Konner, & Shostak, 1988; Ferraro
et al., 2013; Leonard & Robertson, 1997; Lieberman, 2013,
2015; Lieberman, Bramble, Raichlen, & Shea, 2009; Malina
& Little, 2008; Pontzer, 2012; Raichlen & Polk, 2013). Our
physiology may be adapted to respond to the PA-induced
stresses required of this lifestyle, and, when met with an
inactive life common to many industrialized societies, organ
systems (e.g., the cardiovascular system) undergo a reduction
in capacity, sometimes predisposing us to chronic diseases
(Lieberman, 2015). This concept is best described as a PA-
mismatch, where our current environment leads to lower PA
levels compared with our ancestors.
In support of this mismatch hypothesis, researchers gen-
erally invoke observational data showing that modern
hunter-gatherer populations, and those living in small-scale
societies, engage in higher levels of PA than humans living
in more industrialized societies (Cordain et al., 1998; Leon-
ard, 2008; Malina & Little, 2008). However, these analyses
have largely depended on ethnographic accounts of activ-
ities, rather than objective and quantitative measures of PA.
Recent objective measures of activity and energy expenditure
present a more nuanced picture of PA in foraging societies,
and suggest that groups practicing traditional subsistence
may have PA levels within the range of more developed
societies (Gurven, Jaeggi, Kaplan, & Cummings, 2013; Pont-
zer et al., 2012). In fact, direct measures of energy expendi-
ture using the doubly labeled water (DLW) technique show
that overall total energy expenditures (kCal/day) do not differ
in hunter gatherers compared with more urban-living groups
after controlling for fat-free mass, age, and sex (Pontzer,
2015; Pontzer et al., 2012, 2015), raising the possibility that
forager PA levels may not be as high as often assumed.
The goal of this study is to measure PA objectively in a
group of hunter-gatherers (the Hadza of northern Tanzania)
to both characterize activity levels in members of a foraging
society and to place these activity levels into the context of
cardiovascular health in this population. The Hadza inhabit a
highly seasonal woodland-savannah habitat, composed of
rocky, uneven terrain, and dominated by Acacia spp., Com-
miphora spp., and Adansonia digitata (Baobab) trees. Those
individuals who continue to live in traditional ways capture
nearly all of their food from wild resources, including hunt-
ing large and small game, and gathering honey, tubers, ber-
ries, baobab fruit, and other plant foods (Marlowe, 2010;
Wood & Marlowe, 2013). This lifestyle requires consider-
able movement during the day to hunt and gather foods, to
collect water, to gather firewood, and to make social visits to
neighboring camps (Marlowe, 2010; Pontzer et al., 2012;
Raichlen et al., 2014).
This study builds on our earlier examinations of Hadza
daily energy expenditure (see Pontzer et al., 2012, 2015) by
using continuous heart rate monitoring to objectively mea-
sure and place Hadza PA levels in the context of current
exercise guidelines for the United States. In addition, we use
multiple datasets examining cardiovascular risk factors in the
Hadza to understand the relationship between PA and health
at the population level. Current recommendations from the
US Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion
(ODPHP: http://health.gov/paguidelines/) suggest that, to
maintain and improve cardiovascular health, adults should
engage in at least 150 min per week of moderate intensity
activity, 75 min per week of vigorous intensity, or an equiva-
lent combination of Moderate and Vigorous Physical Activ-
ity (MVPA) in episodes of 10 min or longer (see Table 1 for
definition of intensity levels). Despite the importance of time
spent in MVPA for maintaining health (Garber et al., 2011),
only a small percentage (<10%) of individuals of all ages in
the US engage in the recommended amounts (Tucker, Welk,
& Beyler, 2011). If human physiology responds positively to
PA because ancestral lifestyles demanded high amounts of
MVPA, then modern hunting and gathering should be asso-
ciated with levels of MVPA as high or higher than those that
produce positive physiological responses in industrialized
societies.

 Tanzania (Setako and Sengeli) (see Supplementary material
Table S1). Subject IDs employed here match those in previ-
ously published studies of this sample (Pontzer et al., 2015).
Data collection took place over four 2-week periods in
August–September 2009, May–June 2010, and January
2011, covering rainy and dry seasons at two camp locations.
Participants in these camps hunted and gathered at least 90%
of their foods from wild resources (Pontzer et al., 2012,
2015). Approval for this research was provided by all gov-
erning organizations (Institutional Review Boards at Wash-
ington University, St. Louis, Stanford University, Harvard
University, Yale University, Hunter College, and the Univer-
sity of Arizona; The Tanzania Commission for Science and
Technology [COSTECH] and the National Institute for Med-
ical Research [NIMR] in Tanzania). All subjects provided
their informed consent prior to participating in this project.
Subjects wore Garmin Forerunner 205 GPS units with a
chest strap to measure heart rate from dawn until dusk. The
Garmin Forerunner 205 records HR measurements when
there is a change in a measured parameter (HR, latitude, lon-
gitude, and elevation). To analyze these data, raw HRs col-
lected at variable time increments were averaged over 1-min
intervals. Only data from days where heart rate was meas-
ured for 7 h or more were included in this analysis. Using
these 1-min bins, time spent in different activity zones was
calculated. Activity zones (light, moderate, vigorous, and
high) were defined following Norton, Norton, and Sadgrove
(2010) (Table 1). HRmax for each participant was calculated
using the age-adjusted equation from Tanaka, Monahan, and
Seals (2001).
Time spent in each activity zone was calculated in two
ways. First, total time spent in each zone was summed for
each subject for each day, using 1-min bins of HR data. Sec-
ond, following Barreira et al. (2016), activity “bouts” were
analyzed. An activity bout was defined as a period of time
during which a given activity level was maintained for at
least 10 min. Using this method, time spent in a given activ-
ity level was included in the total if it fell within a continu-
ous bout of at least 10 min duration. This method makes use
of recommendations for engagement in physical activity
developed by the United States Office of Disease Prevention
and Health Promotion (i.e., MVPA counts towards goal lev-
els if a bout lasts at least 10 min). We analyzed time spent in
activity zones using both total time and time as a percentage
of heart rate monitor (HRM) wear-time.
We explored predictors of time spent in MVPA using
linear mixed models to account for the repeated measure-
ments of heart rate from the same subjects over multiple
days, and included age and sex as covariates in these models.
In addition, we examined the possibility that individuals
modulate their overall PA by alternating days with high lev-
els of MVPA and days engaged in lower amounts of MVPA.
For individuals with five or more consecutive days of HRM
data, we tested the hypothesis that individuals alternate days
with high and low MVPA using auto-correlations of time
spent in MVPA with 1, 2, or 3 day lags.
Finally, we used two approaches to evaluate the relation-
ship between HR and total energy expenditure (TEE), meas-
ured using data obtained on the same participants from the
DLW method (IAEA, 2009; Pontzer et al., 2012, 2015).
Both of these analyses were performed on a subset of the
total sample. First, to examine the effects of MVPA on total
energy expenditure (TEE), we used multiple regressions to
determine the effects of MVPA on TEE measured with
DLW. Second, we used the Flex-HR method (Leonard,
2003) to estimate TEE from calibrated HR data. To calibrate
HR to energy expenditure, subjects (n 5 18; 7F 11M) wore a
portable, breath-by-breath respirometry system (Cosmed
K4b2) that captured expired air via a lightweight plastic
mask and monitored oxygen consumption and CO2 produc-
tion. These trials are described in our initial report (Pontzer
et al., 2012) and occurred during the same field season as the
HR data collection. Briefly, subjects stood for 10 min, then
performed a series of walking trials at three self-selected
walking speeds (slow, normal, and fast) and two running
speeds (normal and fast) over a level 150 m trackway laid
out near camp. Each speed was maintained for a minimum
of 4 min to attain steady-state aerobic energy expenditure.
Some subjects opted not to perform the running trials. HR
was also measured simultaneously during these trials, and
the ordinary least squares regression for HR against energy
expenditure was used to establish subject-specific HR cali-
brations. Mean HR during standing trials was used as each
subject’s “Flex HR,” and calibration equations were used to
convert HR measured during daily GPS follows to kcal/min,
following Leonard (2003). For all epochs with HR above the
subject’s Flex HR, energy expenditure was estimated from
their calibration equation. For all epochs with HR below the
Flex HR, including any periods when the GPS and HR mon-
itor were not worn (i.e., evening and night), the rate of
energy expenditure during the standing trial was used. Flex
HR estimates of energy expenditure were then integrated
over each 24-h day to estimate TEE.
2.2 | Cardiovascular health biomarkers
As part of ongoing long-term fieldwork with the Hadza,
team members have collected markers of cardiovascular
health across several field seasons to characterize cardiovas-
cular disease risk at the population level. Blood pressure data
were collected during three field seasons for a sample of
Hadza subjects living in multiple camps (n 5 198; see Sup-
plementary material Table S1). This sample included 30 indi-
viduals who are also in the heart rate study, and other
individuals

 gathering, as well as mixed subsistence involving farming
and ethno-tourism. Although cardiovascular health marker
data were not collected in the same field season as heart rate
data collected for this project, they do provide a general view
of cardiovascular disease risk in the Hadza population.
As part of the 2015 field season, we used a portable pro-
fessional blood test device (CardioChek PA®, Polymer
Technology Systems, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) to measure
blood lipids (n 5 22) at a camp (Sengeli) that was practicing
traditional foraging. This sample included six individuals
who were also a part of the heart rate study. The CardioChek
meter was calibrated prior to each measurement session. Fin-
gerstick capillary whole blood samples were collected and
analyzed using the CardioChek point of care meter following
package instructions. Recent work has shown that the Cardi-
oChek system provides results that are within 10% of serum
reference values for all blood lipids (Donato et al., 2015).
Using this system, we measured total cholesterol, HDL lev-
els, triglyceride levels, and calculated LDL levels from total
cholesterol, HDL, and triglyceride values following (Manni-
nen et al., 1992). We used guidelines of the U.S. National
Cholesterol Education report to determine risk levels for
blood lipids: Total Cholesterol – desirable levels are
<200 mg/dL, high levels are �240 mg/dL; LDL – optimal
levels are <100 mg/dL, high levels are >160 mg/dL; triglyc-
erides – normal levels are <200 mg/dL, high levels are
>400 mg/dL; HDL – desirable levels are �60 mg/dL, high-
risk levels are <40 mg/dL.
Finally, because previous work has shown that low blood
lipid levels in small-scale societies may be related to high
levels of infections (Vasunilashorn et al., 2010), we collected
blood spots for a sample of subjects from Sengeli in 2015
(n 5 23) and measured biomarkers of inflammation and
infection (C-reactive protein [CRP] and immunoglobulin E
[IgE]). As with the blood lipid data, this sample included six
individuals who were also a part of the heart rate study. CRP
is a measure of inflammation that increases in the presence
of infection, but when chronically high, is associated with
increased risk of cardiovascular disease (Ridker et al., 2010).
IgE levels are associated with allergic reactions and parasitic
infections (Vasunilashorn et al., 2010). Finger stick capillary
whole blood samples were collected onto Whatman 903 filter
paper cards following a standard protocol (McDade, Wil-
liams, & Snodgrass, 2007), and dried blood spot samples
were analyzed at the University of Oregon. Cards were stored
at ambient air temperatures. Blood spot samples were analyzed
using previously described high-sensitivity enzyme immunoas-
says (see McDade et al., 2012). We converted dried blood spot
(DBS) values of CRP into serum equivalent values using the
equation from McDade et al. (2012): serum CRP (mg/l) 5 1.84
* CRPDBS (mg/l). We converted DBS values of IgE to serum
equivalent values using the following equation from Blackwell
et al. (2011): IgEserum 5 0.965*IgEDBS-3.458 (IU/ml).

 age is a significant predictor of time spent in MVPA (activity
levels increase with age), while sex does not have a signifi-
cant effect on time spent in MVPA (Table 3). There was no
evidence that individuals alternate between days with high
levels of MVPA and days with low levels of MVPA regard-
less of how activity levels were defined (1-min or 10-min
bouts). No individuals had significant autocorrelations (we
examined lags of 1, 2, and 3 days) (Supplementary material
Tables S4 and S5). It is possible that sample sizes were too
small to detect significant correlations. However, the major-
ity of the correlation coefficients were negative, which was
expected (Supplementary material Tables S4 and S5).
Flex-HR estimates of TEE did not differ significantly
from DLW measurements (P 5 0.18, n 5 18 subjects, Stu-
dent’s paired t-test; Figure 3). However, the strength of the
relationship between Flex HR estimates and DLW measure-
ments was modest and the slope differed significantly from
identity (slope 5 0.49 standard error 6 0.18, model adjusted
r2 5 0.30, P 5 0.01). With the regression forced through the
origin,

ined the amount of variation in TEE measured via DLW
explained by the following variables: average time spent in
MVPA (raw or as percent of day), fat-free mass, sex, and
age. For all calculations of time spent in MVPA, activity was
not a significant factor, and only fat-free mass explained a
significant amount of variation in TEE (Table 4).
We found little evidence of cardiovascular disease risk in
the blood pressure sample or the blood biomarker sample.
While blood pressure and blood biomarker data were col-
lected at a different time than heart rate data, they provide a
population-level cardiovascular health context for interpret-
ing physical activity results. Blood pressures in this group
were lower, on average, than age-matched samples from the
United States (Figure 4; Table 5). In a linear mixed effects
model, age had a significant effect on systolic (P < 0.001;
Estimate 6 standard
error 5 0.35 6 0.07)
and
diastolic
(P 5 0.027; Estimate 6 standard error 5 0.12 6 0.05) blood
pressures, while sex had no effect on either systolic blood
pressure (P 5 0.562) or diastolic blood pressure (P 5 0.511).
Blood markers of cardiovascular disease (cholesterol lev-
els and CRP) also do not show any strong evidence of cardi-
ovascular risk. Because the CardioChek system does not
provide values of total cholesterol below 100, we provide
descriptive data from our small sample (Table 6). From these
data, none of our subjects display total cholesterol values
that are in a high cardiovascular risk group (i.e., >200 mg/
dl) and only a single subject possessed LDL levels that were
over the threshold for optimal scores (<100 mg/dl). Over

 half of our subjects have HDL cholesterol values in a high-
risk category (<40 mg/dl); however, combined with low
LDL levels, low HDL levels are not considered high risk
(Ridker et al., 2010). Serum-equivalent CRP values were
low in this sample of Hadza individuals, with �74% of par-
ticipants falling below the high-risk threshold of 3 mg/L
(Table 6). Immunoglobulin values do not suggest high levels
of infection in this population that could play a role in the

DISCUSSION
Unsurprisingly, our results show that individuals practicing a
hunting and gathering lifestyle engage in large amounts of
MVPA on a daily basis. On average, our subjects engaged in
MVPA for �135 min per day, an amount that is well over
the levels suggested to promote cardiovascular health by the
ODPHP. When examined in 10-min bouts, as recommended
by the ODPHP, Hadza participants still greatly exceed US
guidelines, engaging in an average of �76 min per day (sur-
passing US weekly guidelines within 2 days). Males and
females both exceed ODPHP recommendations by a large
amount, with no statistical differences between the sexes.
Age does seem to have an effect on time spent in MVPA,
corroborating observational and objectively measured data
showing older adults in small-scale societies, including the
Hadza, continue to engage in moderate intensity physical
activity across the lifespan (defined using both subjective
and objective measures), with only minor declines in total
physical activity (Gurven et al., 2013; Hawkes, O’Connell,
& Blurton Jones, 1989). Although ours is not the first study
to show higher levels of PA in small-scale societies (see
Gurven et al., 2013; Madimenos et al., 2011), we provide
quantitative data on high levels of cardiac exertion in a group
living a traditional hunting and gathering lifestyle.
These levels of PA are generally thought to benefit the
cardiovascular system (Archer & Blair, 2011). While our
biomarker dataset cannot speak to the cardiovascular benefits
of PA at the individual level, we believe the lack of perva-
sive cardiovascular disease risk in the Hadza is consistent
with their overall high levels of engagement in MVPA at the
population level. Biomarkers of cardiovascular risk including
blood pressure and cholesterol levels fall below clinically rel-
evant

 cardiovascular health across the lifespan compared with pop-
ulations in the United States. While HDL cholesterol levels
are low in this sample, we note that in individuals with low
LDL cholesterol levels, low HDL levels are not considered
high risk (Ridker et al., 2010). Recent work in other small-
scale societies suggests that low levels of cardiovascular dis-
ease biomarkers (i.e., blood lipids) are associated with infec-
tions (Vasunilashorn et al., 2010). However, with the
exception of a single individual (HZ54) there is no strong
evidence that our participants were experiencing acute infec-
tions (CRP values >10 mg/L), and, our results are consistent
with data from industrialized societies that suggest a strong
link between high levels of MVPA and reduced biomarkers
of cardiovascular disease risk (see Archer & Blair, 2011).
Thus, the Hadza population may be reaping exercise-induced
cardiovascular benefits with healthy vasculature and low bio-
marker risk of cardiovascular disease, similar to the low lev-
els of cardiovascular disease-related biomarkers found in

 other small-scale societies that practice some level of PA-
based subsistence (Liebert et al., 2013; Vasunilashorn et al.,
2010).
While our results support the hypothesis that hunter-
gatherer MVPA levels are high and are consistent with
amounts of MVPA that benefit overall health, our data also
continue to support the notion that high PA levels are not
associated with high total energy expenditures in this group.
Calibrated HR estimates of TEE matched DLW measure-
ments. Pontzer (2015) details a model of TEE that is con-
strained within an individual or species and malleable over
evolutionary time (Pontzer, 2015; Pontzer et al., 2016).
Although the mechanism is not well understood, high levels
of PA for a given individual lead to either changes in non-
exercise metabolism (e.g., reductions in energy spent on
reproductive activity or somatic maintenance), or alternating
periods of activity with rest, such that, in a recent study, high
levels of PA did not lead to an associated increase in TEE
(see Pontzer et al., 2016). In our sample, there was no rela-
tionship between time spent in MVPA and TEE and no evi-
dence that individuals alternate days of rest and activity.
Overall, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that
high activity levels may be offset in some way and that TEE
may be partially constrained within an individual and
species.
4.1 | Comparison with other populations
Previous work has estimated time spent in PA within small-
scale societies using a wide variety of techniques, including
DLW and factorial methods based on behavioral observation
(see Leonard, Galloway, & Ivakine, 1997; Pontzer et al.,
2012, 2015). These methods have been notoriously problem-
atic since DLW averages energy costs of effort over multiple

 days and observational methods present difficulties in accu-
rately gauging the level of effort applied to a particular activ-
ity by different individuals (Leonard et al., 1997). More
recently, researchers have used accelerometry and heart rate
to objectively measure PA in non-industrial subsistence con-
texts (Gurven et al., 2013; Madimenos, Snodgrass, Black-
well, Liebert, & Sugiyama, 2011). Using a combination of
heart rate and accelerometry, Gurven et al. (2013) showed
that in Tsimane participants (forager-horticulturalists from
the Bolivian Amazon), men had physical activity levels at
the high end of a comparison with industrialized societies,
while women engaged in lower amounts of PA than men,
and fell into an intermediate range of comparative physical
activity levels. Additionally, in the Tsimane, older adults
spend less of their day in moderate or vigorous activity.
Madimenos et al. (2011) measured PA levels using waist-
worn accelerometers in the Shuar, a forager-horticulturalist
population living in neo-tropical Ecuador. Although the
researchers did not break down PA levels by intensity, they
did find significantly higher levels of total PA in males com-
pared with females, and did not find any significant effect of
age on overall PA levels (Madimenos et al., 2011).
While these studies are the only ones, to our knowledge,
with direct measures of PA, their results are similar to those
found in other small-scale societies with mostly agricultural
or pastoral lifestyles that have used indirect estimates of PA
(Dufour & Piperata, 2008; Kashiwazaki, Dejima, Orias-
Rivera, & Coward, 1995; Lawrence & Whitehead, 1988).
Contrasting with these results, we found that Hadza partici-
pants engaged in large amounts of moderate and vigorous
activity overall, that males and females do not significantly
differ in time spent in MVPA, and that levels of MVPA may
actually increase with age (however, see below for interpreta-
tion of age-effects). While methodological differences may
explain the variance in MVPA among populations, our
results suggest hunting and gathering populations may
engage in higher levels of MVPA than agriculture-based
societies. The lack of sex difference in MVPA among the
Hadza is of particular interest since males walk farther, on
average, each day in this sample (Pontzer et al., 2012, 2015).
Heart rate monitors capture activities that are upper body-
based and likely more prevalent in females (e.g., pounding
nuts or digging), but that would not be measured with GPS
or waist-worn accelerometry. In addition, females often carry
large loads while walking, including offspring, firewood,
water, and food (see Marlowe, 2010), which may lead to
higher heart rates than expected by analysis of GPS-based
walking speed or distance alone.
Our results also suggest that Hadza hunter-gatherers
engage in a much larger amount of PA than those living in
more industrialized societies. In a comparison of populations
from five countries varying in degrees of socio-economic
development, time spent in MVPA as measured by acceler-
ometry was considerably lower than we measured in the
Hadza participants: Ghana (34.7 6 23.4 min/day), South
Africa (38.1 6 33.8 min/day), Jamaica (26.0 6 21.7 min/
day), Seychelles (32.5 6 23.2 min/day), and Urban Chicago,
USA (25.8 6 31.9 min/day) (Dugas et al., 2014). Using a
very large accelerometry dataset from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), Tucker et al.
(2011) found that a geographically diverse sample of adults
living in the United States engage in, on average, 45.1 6 4.6
min/week of moderate PA and 18.6 6 6.6 min/week of vig-
orous PA (i.e., just over an hour per week of MVPA). By
comparison, our data suggest Hadza participants engage in
�805 min of moderate PA and �137 min of vigorous PA
per week, �14.8 times higher than adults in the US. Using a
slightly older NHANES dataset, Troiano et al. (2008) broke
down accelerometry data into time spent in bouts of at least
10 min. US children spend �25 to 45 min in MVPA while
Hadza children engage in over an hour per day of moderate
PA when calculated using the 10-min bout method. Differen-
ces between US subjects and Hadza subjects increase with
age. For example, US adults engaged in only �6 to 10 min
per day of MVPA (Troiano et al., 2008). Any way we exam-
ine the data, Hadza hunter-gatherers across the lifespan
engage in higher levels of MVPA than individuals living in
the US.
4.2 | Age-related changes in MVPA
Our data show that older Hadza adults may engage in higher
amounts of MVPA than younger individuals, differing from
age-related patterns found in other small-scale and industrial-
ized societies. While it is possible that these results reflect
increased PA in aging individuals, it is also possible that
physiological changes in the relationship between HR and
physical activity associated with age influence our results.
Maximum HR is known to decline with age (Tanaka et al.,
2001), and this rate of decline, derived from Western popula-
tions, shapes the standard age-specific cut-offs for MVPA.
Because we calculated activity intensities using these age-
dependent equations, it is possible that variation in the
decline of HRs with age among individuals artificially
increases estimates of activity intensity. In addition, while
maximum heart rate declines with age, in aerobically trained
older athletes, other aspects of physiology mitigate the
effects of this decline on exercise performance, including
prevention of reductions in maximal stroke volume and
enhancing the ability of muscles to extract oxygen from
blood (Heath, Hagberg, Ehsani, & Holloszy, 1981; Pollock
et al., 1997). Thus, we believe the most appropriate interpre-
tation of our results is that we do not find evidence of a sig-
nificant decline in engagement in MVPA in older adults in
our sample.

CONCLUSIONS
Our results show that Hadza hunter-gatherers spend much
higher amounts of time in MVPA than do individuals in
more industrialized societies. Along with studies of other
small-scale societies, this pattern suggests that our ancestors,
who practiced hunting and gathering for �2.0 million years,
were adapted to a lifestyle characterized by long periods of
time spent in MVPA. Within the framework of the PA mis-
match hypothesis, our results provide some context for
understanding the amounts of cardiac stress experienced by
hunter-gatherers, and, therefore, the stresses that lead to
improved cardiac health. It is important to note that diet
plays a major role in cardiovascular disease risk, and dietary
mismatches described by others are likely responsible in part
for lower disease risk among hunter-gatherers (Cordain
et al., 2005; Eaton et al., 1988). However, as described ear-
lier, PA independently stresses specific organ systems,
requiring an expansion of capacity that is often associated
with health benefits (Lieberman, 2015). In the absence of
PA-induced stimuli, reductions in capacity are associated
with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Thus, we
believe our reliance on exercise for the maintenance of health
is best understood through the lens of our evolutionary his-
tory as aerobically active hunters and gatherers. Additional
comparative data for other populations would allow us to
more fully model plausible activity patterns in human ances-
tors, but our results support the hypothesis that hunting and
gathering requires high levels of MVPA.
