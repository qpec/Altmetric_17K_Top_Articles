 Background—We previously reported a modest excess of cancer cases in World Trade Center 
(WTC) exposed firefighters as compared with the general population. This study aimed to separate 
the potential carcinogenic effects of firefighting and WTC-exposure by using a cohort of non-
WTC-exposed firefighters as the referent group.
Methods—Relative rates (RRs) for all cancers combined and individual cancer subtypes from 
9/11/2001-12/31/2009 were modelled using Poisson regression comparing 11,457 WTC-exposed 
firefighters to 8,220 non-WTC-exposed firefighters from San Francisco, Chicago, and 
Philadelphia.
Results—Compared with non-WTC-exposed firefighters, there was no difference in the RR of all 
cancers combined for WTC-exposed firefighters (RR=0.96, 95% CI: 0.83–1.12). Thyroid cancer 
was significantly elevated (RR=3.82, 95% CI: 1.07–20.81) over the entire study; this was 
attenuated (RR=3.43, 95% CI: 0.94–18.94) and non-significant in a secondary analysis controlling 
for possible surveillance bias. Prostate cancer was elevated during the latter half 
(1/1/2005-12/31/2009; RR=1.38, 95% CI: 1.01–1.88).
Conclusions—Further follow-up is needed with this referent population to assess the 
relationship between WTC-exposure and cancers with longer latency periods.

Introduction
The attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC) on September 11, 2001 (9/11) and the 
months of rescue and recovery efforts that followed exposed more than 13,000 career 
firefighters employed by the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY) and tens of 
thousands of other individuals to many potentially harmful substances. These substances 
included pulverized cement, glass fibers, asbestos, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and 
polychlorinated furans and dioxins in the tons of dust resulting from the collapse of the 
buildings and from combustion products from fires that burned through December 2001 
[Landrigan, et al. 2004, Lioy and Georgopoulos 2006, Lioy, et al. 2002, Lorber, et al. 2007]. 
Asbestos and PCBs are classified as carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for 
Research on Cancer (IARC) [Lauby-Secretan, et al. 2013, Straif, et al. 2009], and several 
PAHs are considered to be probable carcinogens [CDC 2011]. Specifically, bladder, 
gastrointestinal, liver, lung, prostate, melanoma, mesothelioma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
have been found to be related to some or many of the substances found at the WTC site 
[Boffetta, et al. 1997, Boulanger, et al. 2015, Charles, et al. 2003, Faroon, et al. 2001, 
Fortunato and Rushton 2015, Freeman and Kohles 2012, Gallagher, et al. 2011, Goswami, et

Offermans, et al. 2014, Pi, et al. 2016, Rota, et al. 2014, Ruder, et al. 2014]. Animal models 
have shown that PCBs affect thyroid function [Hagmar 2003], and that PBDEs may cause 
thyroid cancer [Zhang, et al. 2008]

 Since 9/11 we, and others, have documented an association between WTC-exposure and 
cancer [Kleinman, et al. 2015, Li, et al. 2012, Moline, et al. 2009, Solan, et al. 2013, Zeig-
Owens, et al. 2011]. In 2011, we reported an elevated rate of all cancers combined among 
WTC-exposed FDNY firefighters compared with the general US population (standardized 
incidence ratio [SIR] =1.10, 95% CI: 0.98–1.25) [Zeig-Owens, et al. 2011]. Although this 
difference was not statistically significant, secondary analyses did reveal statistically 
significant SIRs. Since our first report, similar findings have been demonstrated among other 
WTC-exposed cohorts of rescue and recovery workers (SIR =1.14, 95% CI: 0.99–1.30 [Li, 
et al. 2012] and SIR =1.15, 95% CI: 1.06–1.25 [Solan, et al. 2013]). Among FDNY 
firefighters, as in the other two WTC cohorts, some cancer types, such as prostate and 
thyroid cancer, were also elevated with higher levels of association. For example, the 
incidence of thyroid cancer among WTC-exposed firefighters, based on 17 cases, was more 
than twice the thyroid cancer rate among men in the US, adjusting for age and race/ethnicity. 
The SIR for thyroid cancer was 3.07 (95% CI 1.86–5.08); after correcting for potential 
increased medical surveillance, the SIR was reduced to 2.17 (95% CI 1.23–3.82) [Zeig-
Owens, et al. 2011].
Our original study did not address the extent to which firefighting exposures contributed to 
the observed effect of WTC-exposure on cancer risk. The impact of firefighting on cancer 
risk has been debated in peer-reviewed studies for years as firefighting may expose workers 
to carcinogens in volatilized combustion and pyrolysis products or debris [Bates 2007, 
Daniels, et al. 2014, Kang, et al. 2008, LeMasters, et al. 2006, Ma, et al. 2006, Tsai, et al. 
2015]. One of the largest and most recent studies followed 29,993 professional firefighters 
from three densely-populated cities (San Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia) from 1950 to 
2009[Daniels, et al. 2014]. Among its findings, that study reported an elevated SIR for all 
cancers combined (SIR 1.09, 95% CI 1.06–1.12), which included elevated rates for digestive 
(SIR 1.17 95% CI 1.10– 1.25) and respiratory tumors (SIR 1.16, 95% CI 1.08–1.24), and for 
mesothelioma (SIR 2.29, 95% CI 1.60–3.19). Given many similarities including pre-hire 
fitness requirements, management, firefighting tactics, and hazards faced by urban 
firefighters in large city departments, firefighters from other urban settings form a superior 
referent group compared to the general population in studies of FDNY firefighters. 
Therefore, the aim of the current study was to compare post-9/11/2001 cancer incidence 
rates in FDNY WTC-exposed firefighters to incidence rates observed in the cohort of San 
Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia non-WTC-exposed firefighters. This latter group of 
firefighters is hereafter referred to as the referent group.

 obtained through fire department rosters. The FDNY group was an extension of the original 
WTC-exposed study population [Zeig-Owens, et al. 2011], with the addition of 3,483 
firefighters hired after 1/1/1996. WTC-exposure was established via self-report [Webber, et 
al. 2011, Zeig-Owens, et al. 2011]; FDNY firefighters not reporting any WTC-exposure 
were excluded from the analyses. The FDNY source population included 12,595 WTC-
exposed firefighters, including all officer ranks and job-positions, who were employed at 
FDNY on or after 1/1/1996, actively employed for at least 1.5 years prior to the end of the 
study on 12/31/2009, and whose identifying information had been sent to various state 
cancer registries for matching. The 1/1/1996 date was chosen to match the criteria of the 
study population of our prior study; the date was initially chosen on the basis of 
completeness of data in the New York State Cancer Registry. For this study, the source 
population was further restricted to white males contributing person years at risk (PYARs) 
between ages 30 and 70 years within the time period from 9/11/2001 to study end. The 
referent group was assembled from the previous study data by applying the FDNY eligibility 
and exclusion criteria with the exception of WTC-exposure. WTC-exposure status was 
unavailable for the referent group, so all members were considered unexposed.
Cancer Cases
Methods used to obtain information on cancer diagnoses from state cancer registries are 
described elsewhere [Daniels, et al. 2014, Zeig-Owens, et al. 2011]. Briefly, cancer 
diagnoses were ascertained by probabilistic matching to state cancer registries. All 
firefighters were matched to outcome data using personal identifiers, such as social security 
number, full name, race and ethnic origin, and date of birth. States were chosen to include 
state of residence of the majority of active and retired firefighters. FDNY linked to Arizona, 
Connecticut, Florida, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina 
and Virginia; 99% of the FDNY WTC-exposed cohort lived in one of these states. The 
referent group was linked with Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, 
Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington; 95% of the referent group 
lived in one of these states. Unlike our original cancer study, this study only included cancer 
cases obtained from the matching to state cancer registries; this is so the case ascertainment 
methods were the same for both groups. Cases comprised first primary malignant tumors 
diagnosed during the study period (9/11/2001 – 12/31/2009); subsequent tumors were not 
included in these analyses. In addition to all cancer sites combined, separate analyses were 
conducted for colon cancer, all hematologic cancers (Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, 
multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and other hematopoietic cancers), lung cancer, 
melanoma of the skin, prostate cancer, and thyroid cancer.
Additional Variables
Demographic information including date of birth, date of death, sex, and race/ethnicity, as 
well as years of service was obtained from employee databases. Death information was 
additionally obtained from state vital record centers, the Social Security Death Master File, 
National Death Index, and retirement boards.

 Statistical Analyses
All analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 
USA). For main analyses, we used PROC GENMOD to model rate ratios for all cancers and 
site-specific cancers comparing exposed to unexposed using Poisson regression with the log 
of person-years as an offset and adjusting for age using 5-year categories. The exact method 
was used to calculate 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Follow-up time started at the 
latest of 9/11/2001, 30th birthday, or 1.5 years after the post-9/11 hire date, and ended at the 
earliest of cancer diagnosis, death, 70th birthday, or the end of the study on 12/31/2009.
We additionally performed two secondary analyses. First, to explore the potential latency of 
the effect of WTC-exposure on cancer incidence, we stratified the follow-up period into an 
early period, from 9/11/2001 through 12/31/2004, and a late period from 1/1/2005 through 
12/31/2009, and analyzed each period separately. Second, we examined the potential for 
surveillance bias. WTC-exposed FDNY firefighters have access to health care and routine 
health monitoring exams even after retirement including chest CT scans among highly 
WTC-exposed firefighters and routine blood testing. This could cause surveillance bias if 
FDNY cancers were diagnosed earlier than they would have otherwise been diagnosed due 
to screenings that were not available to the referent group after retirement. To assess this 
potential surveillance bias, we identified all cases of lung, liver, thyroid, or kidney cancer or 
Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed less than 6 months after a surveillance chest 
CT scan and all cases of prostate or hematological cancers diagnosed less than 6 months 
after routine blood tests as cases potentially detected by FDNY surveillance (n=56). The 
primary analyses were repeated delaying the date of diagnoses for these cases by two years 
[Zeig-Owens, et al. 2011]; the two year lag was determined based on screening-related lead 
time among those with prostate cancer [Andriole, et al. 2009]. Data were not available to 
perform similar restrictions for the referent group.
Results
The FDNY source population included 12,595 firefighters. 907 non-white firefighters and 26 
white female firefighters were excluded due to insufficient numbers in these subgroups to 
generate statistically stable rate estimates. Seventy four additional firefighters were excluded 
for not being between ages 30 and 70 at any point during follow-up. Finally, 131 firefighters 
were excluded for having cancer prior to the start of the study. The final FDNY cohort 
consisted of 11,457 white male firefighters. The referent group had the same exclusion 
criteria and consisted of 8,220 white male firefighters.
Table I shows selected characteristics of both cohorts. Among the 11,457 white male FDNY 
firefighters, there was a total of 89,059 person years of follow-up and among the 8,220 white 
male firefighters from the referent group there were a total of 57,843 person years. The 
average age on 9/11 was lower for FDNY compared with the referent group (40.4 ±8.3 years 
versus 44.9 ±11.5 years, p<0.0001). During follow-up, 345 individuals from the FDNY 
cohort and 443 individuals from the referent group were diagnosed with a first primary 
cancer.

 The relative rates (RRs) are displayed in Table II. There was no significant difference in the 
overall cancer rate between the WTC-exposed FDNY population and the unexposed referent 
group (RR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.83–1.12). Thyroid cancer, however, was significantly elevated 
in the FDNY population (RR=3.82, 95% CI: 1.07–20.81); this comparison was restricted to 
ages between 35 and 60 since there were insufficient cases in other ages. The rate of lung 
cancer was lower in FDNY for ages 45–70 (RR=0.55, 95% CI: 0.26–1.06). No significant 
differences were observed for colon, melanoma, prostate and hematologic cancers, although 
the 95% confidence intervals were fairly wide, primarily due to small numbers of cancers in 
both groups.
The secondary analysis comparing early and late post-9/11 periods showed similar results to 
the primary analysis (Table III). Thyroid cancer was not significantly elevated in either the 
early or late periods (early: RR=5.37, 95% CI: 0.58–264.48; late: RR=3.22, 95% CI: 0.69–
30.41). Prostate cancer became significant in the late period (RR=1.38, 95% CI: 1.01–1.88).
By delaying the diagnosis date by two years for cases potentially detected by FDNY 
surveillance, 44 of the 54 identified cases no longer occurred during the study period. The 
results from this secondary analysis were also similar to the primary analyses (Table IV). 
The RRs for all cancers combined, and lung, thyroid and hematologic cancers decreased 
slightly compared with the primary analysis. For lung and all cancers combined the RRs 
were significantly less than 1, and for thyroid the RR was no longer significantly elevated.
Discussion
This is the first study to investigate the association between WTC-exposure and cancer using 
a comparable occupational reference group rather than the general US population. We found 
that during the study period from 9/11/2001 to 12/31/2009, the all-cancer incidence rate 
among the WTC-exposed firefighters was similar to the rate among the referent group of 
urban US firefighters. As we found in our first study comparing cancer rates with general 
US population rates [Zeig-Owens, et al. 2011], the rate of thyroid cancer among the WTC-
exposed was more than double the reference rate. Currently, other than exposure to 
radiation, which was not elevated at the WTC site, there is a paucity of information 
regarding environmental exposures and thyroid cancer risk [Lioy and Georgopoulos 2006, 
Lioy, et al. 2002]. Additionally, while not statistically significant, we observed elevated rates 
of prostate cancer and melanoma of the skin compared with the reference. The rate of lung 
cancer was lower in the FDNY firefighters compared with the referent group. FDNY may 
have a lower smoking rate than the referent group as the prevalence of smokers in New York 
is lower than in Illinois and Pennsylvania [Nguyen, et al. 2015]. However, this warrants 
further investigation. Because most cancers, especially solid tumors such as lung cancers, 
are believed to take many years to develop [Armenian and Lilienfeld 1974, Breslow and Day 
1993], it is possible that we are unable to see an effect of WTC-exposure during this eight-
year study period. Further follow-up in the FDNY and referent group, and formal latency 
analyses would allow a test of this hypothesis.
Results from the secondary analysis that stratified the follow-up period into an early and a 
late period suggest cancer rates for prostate cancer are driven by cancers diagnosed in the

 late period. Because screening practices did not change during the post-9/11 period, this 
provides some evidence that the lack of statistical significance we reported may be 
influenced by long latency periods, and that the short follow-up period of this study limits 
our ability to detect the full effect of WTC-exposure on cancer. While not statistically 
significant and based on a very small number of cases, the rate of thyroid cancer was 
elevated in the early period, which includes time prior to the known latency of thyroid 
cancer based on previous studies regarding radiation exposure [Davis, et al. 2004]. However, 
as shown by the wide confidence interval, it is possible that the actual rate of thyroid cancer 
among WTC-exposed firefighters may be lower than the rate in the referent group in the 
early time period; conversely, it also could be much higher.
We also found a slight attenuation of relative rates for cancers that may have been detected 
by increased screening in the WTC-exposed firefighter population. In particular the relative 
rate for thyroid cancer, while still over three, was slightly attenuated, suggesting that the 
association between WTC-exposure and thyroid cancer observed in the current study as well 
as the previous studies [Kleinman, et al. 2015, Li, et al. 2012, Moline, et al. 2009, Solan, et 
al. 2013, Zeig-Owens, et al. 2011] may be due in part to increased detection in this WTC-
exposed population as a result of WTC-related screening practices as suggested by findings 
from Li, et al. [2012]. Since 9/11, FDNY has offered WTC-exposed FDNY firefighters a 
chest CT scan screening program for lung abnormalities. Chest CT scans are also conducted 
among patients with respiratory symptoms when clinically needed. 36% of the FDNY study 
population had at least one chest CT scan associated with FDNY since 9/11/2001. Prostate 
serum antigen tests are conducted on all male firefighters 45 years and older during the 
medical monitoring exam. In addition, complete blood counts are conducted during the 
monitoring exam for all firefighters and have the potential to identify hematologic 
malignancies. The referent group firefighters do not have similar screening programs. Our 
secondary analysis did attempt to control for this potential surveillance bias caused by the 
chest CT scans and blood tests screening conducted through FDNY, although WTC-exposed 
firefighters may have also undergone increased screening outside of FDNY for which we are 
unable to account for. Additionally, while we lagged cancer cases suspected of having been 
detected through screening by two years, for some cancers this may not have been sufficient 
given their probable latency times. Of the 10 cases flagged for possible surveillance bias that 
remained in the study after the 2 year lag, 7 were prostate cancer, 1 was bladder cancer, 1 
was lung cancer and 1 was thyroid cancer. Other methods of assessing possible surveillance 
bias, such as comparing cancer stages at diagnosis, were unavailable for this study.
The main limitation of this study is the short follow-up period. Follow-up data for the 
referent group of US firefighters ended in 2009, which limited the follow-up period for this 
study to only eight years. Given that most cancers are believed to have relatively long 
latency periods, it is possible that the effects of WTC-exposure on cancer incidence would 
not manifest until the later part of our study period, or even until after it. Additionally, while 
both cohorts were reasonably large, many of the individual cancers are rare, which combined 
with the short follow-up period led to a small number of cancer cases. Thus we only had the 
power to detect large effects. Ideally, secondary analyses grouping the FDNY population by 
intensity of WTC-exposure, or including the unexposed FDNY firefighters, could provide

 further details of the relationship between WTC-exposure and firefighting on cancer 
incidence; however, due to our lack of power such analyses would not be informative.
Other possible limitations include measurement error, selection bias, and uncontrolled 
confounding. It is likely that some individuals from the referent group volunteered at the 
WTC site following the 9/11 disaster. However, by our best estimates, the number of referent 
firefighters with WTC-exposure is fewer than 80 (<1%). This source of measurement error 
may have biased our results towards the null. Selection bias may have been introduced due 
to excluding non-WTC-exposed firefighters from the FDNY population. Among FDNY 
firefighters who were actively employed on 9/11, almost all report WTC-exposure; 175 
(<2%) firefighters who were active on 9/11and otherwise qualify for this study were 
excluded due to reporting no exposure to the WTC-site (n=68) or missing exposure 
information (n=107). Thus, even if the unexposed had differential cancer risk or firefighting 
exposures, the effect of this bias would be limited. Finally, additional information on factors 
associated with the risk of cancer, such as smoking status, was not available in the referent 
group and therefore these potential confounders could not be examined. While Daniels, et al. 
[2014] concluded that there was generally little evidence of heterogeneity of cancer risk 
across the three fire departments, they did find significant heterogeneity for the incidence of 
lung, prostate and brain cancers. This suggests that there might be additional factors driving 
the observed differences in cancer rates between FDNY and the referent group other than 
WTC-exposure.
Despite these limitations, this study has many strengths. First, this is the first study of a 
WTC-exposed population that used a similar occupational cohort as its referent group. 
Firefighters are exposed to potential carcinogens throughout their careers; by comparing 
FDNY WTC-exposed firefighters to a cohort of urban US firefighters this potential 
confounder has been reduced and, as a result, the separate effect of WTC-exposure can be 
assessed. Additionally, state registry confirmed cancers were included as the outcome for 
both the FDNY WTC-exposed firefighters and the referent group. Therefore, the case 
ascertainment for both cohorts is comparable. Further, we believe the use of high quality fire 
department employment record data allowed us to achieve extremely complete matching 
with high confidence, in both cohorts. This study shows that the combined cohort of 
firefighters from Chicago, San Francisco and Philadelphia can be used as a referent group 
for WTC-exposed FDNY firefighters.
This study investigated the association between WTC-exposure and the incidence of cancer 
among FDNY WTC-exposed firefighters compared with urban, non-WTC-exposed US 
firefighters. While we did not find a difference in overall cancer incidence between the two 
cohorts of firefighters, we did find among the WTC-exposed firefighters that the incidence 
of thyroid cancer was elevated over the entire study period and prostate cancer was elevated 
over the late period. However, the elevated rates may be due in part to increased detection in 
the FDNY cohort. Further follow-up should be conducted with this reference population to 
assess the relationship between WTC-exposure and cancers with longer latency periods and 
aim to control for potential confounders such as smoking.
