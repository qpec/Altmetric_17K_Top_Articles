In human pancreatic islets, the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an extracellular signaling mole-
cule synthesized by and released from the insulin-secreting β cells. The effective, physiological GABA concentra-
tion range within human islets is unknown. Here we use native GABAA receptors in human islet β cells as
biological sensors and reveal that 100–1000 nM GABA elicit the maximal opening frequency of the single-chan-
nels. In saturating GABA, the channels desensitized and stopped working. GABA modulated insulin exocytosis
and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. GABAA receptor currents were enhanced by the benzodiazepine diaz-
epam, the anesthetic propofol and the incretin glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) but not affected by the hypnotic
zolpidem. In type 2 diabetes (T2D) islets, single-channel analysis revealed higher GABA affinity of the receptors.
The findings reveal unique GABAA receptors signaling in human islets β cells that is GABA concentration-depen-
dent, differentially regulated by drugs, modulates insulin secretion and is altered in T2D.

1. Introduction
Pancreatic islet β cells synthesize and release the neurotransmitter
GABA. The enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) makes GABA
from the amino acid glutamate (Baekkeskov et al. 1990). In β cells,
GABA is then stored in synaptic-like microvesicles, in the insulin gran-
ules and in the cytoplasm until secreted (Braun et al. 2010; Braun et
al. 2004; Kanaani et al. 2015). The roles of GABA in the islets are
many; GABA has been linked to regulation of β cells proliferation and
β cell mass (Soltani et al. 2011; Tian et al. 2013), the change of α cells
into β cells (Ben-Othman et al. 2017; Lawlor et al. 2017; Li et al.
2017), and regulation of hormone secretion (Braun et al. 2010; Li et al.
2015; Taneera et al., 2012). GABA also inhibits immune cells
(Bjurstom et al. 2008; Tian et al. 2004) and, thereby, potentially in-
creases β cells survival (Fiorina 2013). Importantly, GAD autoantibodies
are associated with the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) where β
cell mass decreases or even disappears whereas in T2D β cell function is
compromised (American 2017; Giorda et al. 2016) resulting in abnor-
mally high blood glucose. When the β cell mass declines, the GABA
will diminish in the islets making it more difficult for the β cells to influ-
ence their own fate. What the physiologically relevant GABA concentra-
tions are in the human islets or what GABA receptor subtypes
participate in the signaling is not known (Caicedo 2013; Rodriguez-
Diaz and Caicedo 2014; Rorsman and Braun 2013). Importantly, in
human islets, insulin-, glucagon- and somatostatin-secreting β, α and
δ cells, respectively, all express GABAA receptors (Braun et al. 2010).
This renders the human islet GABA signaling distinct from e.g. signaling
in rat and guinea pig islets where functional GABAA receptors are not
expressed in the β cells (Gilon et al. 1991; Jin et al. 2013; Rorsman et
al. 1989; Wendt et al. 2004). The GABAA receptor activity in the brain
is enhanced by a number of medicines such as the benzodiazepines, an-
esthetics and even by the metabolic hormone GLP-1 and its analogue
exendin-4 (Korol et al. 2015; Olsen and Sieghart 2008). GLP-1 is a
very effective insulin secretagogue (Holst 2007). It is clearly of interest
to understand the effects these compounds may have on the GABAA re-
ceptors in the human islet β cells.
Here we use the native GABAA receptors in β cells as biological sen-
sors for GABA to determine the effective, physiological GABA concentra-
tion-range in the human islets. We then characterize β cell-specific
high-affinity GABAA receptors and define their pharmacological profile
and further identify their modulation of exocytosis. In T2D, the GABA
signaling in the β cells was altered.

 2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Intact Human Pancreatic Islets
Human islets were generously provided by the Nordic Network for
Clinical Islet Transplantation, supported by EXODIAB and the Juvenile
Diabetes Research Foundation. All procedures were approved by the re-
gional ethics committee in Uppsala and informed consent obtained by
appropriate measures from donors or their relatives. Islets were ob-
tained from ND and T2D (HbA1c = 6.5 ± 0.16, mean ± standard
error of the mean, SEM) donors and isolated using collagenase digestion
and Biocoll gradient centrifugation (Fred et al. 2010), separately for
each pancreas. The islets were then hand-picked and cultured free-
floating in CMRL 1066 (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA, USA) supple-
mented with 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin,
0.25 μg/ml fungizone (GIBCO, BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), 20 μg/ml
ciprofloxacin (Bayer Healthcare, Leverkusen, Germany), and 10 mM
nicotinamide at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2,
vol/vol and used in the experiments from second day of incubation up
to 12 days of culturing.
2.2. Electrophysiological Experiments
The whole-cell patch-clamp configuration was obtained on intact is-
lets using the blind patch-clamp technique (Hamill et al. 1981; Jin et al.
2011; Neher and Sakmann 1976) and single-channel currents were re-
corded at room temperature (20–22 °C) or at 34 °C. The single intact
islet was held by the holding pipette and approached by the recording
pipette from the other side (see Fig. 1a). The holding and recording pi-
pettes were made from borosilicate glass. During experiments, the pan-
creatic islets were perfused with the extracellular solution (mM): 137
NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 2.6 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES and 20 glucose (pH 7.4
using NaOH) at the rate of 3 ml/min. The intracellular solution consisted
of (mM): 135 CsCl, 30 CsOH, 1 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, 5 HEPES and 3 Mg-ATP
(pH 7.2 with HCl). Drugs were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Steinheim, Germany) or Ascent Scientific (Bristol, UK). Pentobarbital,
propofol, GLP-1 and the GABAAR antagonist SR95531 were dissolved
in the extracellular solution. Diazepam, zolpidem and the GABAAR an-
tagonist picrotoxin stock solutions were made in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and then dissolved in the extracellular solution. The final con-
centration of DMSO was 0.1% and did not affect the recordings
(Eghbali et al. 1997). Recordings were done using an Axopatch 200B
amplifier, filtered at 2 kHz, digitized on-line at 10 kHz using an ana-
log-to-digital converter and Clampex 10.5 (Molecular Devices, CA,
USA) software. The access resistance was monitored and if it changed
by N25%, the recording was rejected. The single-channel parameters
(amplitude, frequency/opening rate, conductance, open probability Po,
mean current Imean and mean open time To) were analyzed by Channel3
(Nicholas Laver, Derek Laver, the University of Newcastle, Australia)
and Clampfit 10.5 (Molecular Devices, USA). We used a simplified ver-
sion of a model, previously established by Jones and Westbrook (Jones
and Westbrook 1995) to describe the activation of GABAA receptors
(see Fig. 2a model scheme). Simulations of opening rate and mean
open time were generated from this theoretical model using the “Q-ma-
trix” method of Colquhoun and Hawkes (Colquhoun and Hawkes 1981,
1982). We accounted for the effects of missed events due to filtering
using the “effective rate constant” method of Blatz and Magleby (Blatz
and Magleby 1986) incorporating an event dead-time of 0.1 ms.
2.3. Cytoplasm Harvest and Single-Cell Reverse Transcription Polymerase
Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
The procedure for cytosome harvesting and single-cell RT-PCR have
been previously described (Jin et al. 2013). In brief, the cytosome of the
cell was harvested in the recording pipette by applying a negative pres-
sure to the pipette at the end of patch-clamp recordings. The harvesting
was terminated immediately before or as soon as the seal broke. The
content in the pipette (around 5 μl) was expelled to a 0.2 ml RNase-
free PCR tube that was immediately frozen on the dry ice and then
stored at −80 °C. The pipette solution and recoding pipettes were
autoclaved and the recording electrode was cleaned with 70% ethanol
followed by cleaning with RNAase away (Thermo Scientific). The har-
vested cytosome was subjected to the reverse transcription (RT) step
that was performed with Verso™ cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scien-
tific). The 20 μl reverse transcription reaction was incubated at 42 °C
for 30 min followed by a second incubation at 95 °C for 2 min. PCR
was performed in a 10 μl reaction mixture containing 3 μl cDNA, 5×
SYBR Green I (Life Technologies), 1× PCR reaction buffer, MgCl2
(3 mM), dNTP (0.3 mM), 1× ROX reference dye, 0.8 U JumpStart Taq
DNA polymerase (Sigma-Adrich; Jin et al. 2013) and hormone gene-
specific primers. The PCR amplification was performed using the ABI
PRISM 7900 HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems)
with an initial denaturation step of 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 45 cycles
of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min, and one melting curve
step. The primers for hormone genes are insulin (1-forward:

TTG;

GGGCATCATTCTCCGTCTGGT; 2-forward: CCCAGACTCCGTCAGTTTCT,
2-reverse: AAGTACTTGGCCAGTTCCTGC). The PCR product was exam-
ined by the melting curve and/or run on a 1.5% agarose gel stained
with SYBR Gold DNA gel stain (Life Technologies). Total RNA samples
from human islets and the intracellular solution or water served as the
positive control and negative control, respectively.
2.4. GABAAR Subunits Expression Profile in Human and Mouse β Cells from
Single-Cell RNA-seq Data
To examine the GABA receptor subunits expression in human and
mouse β cells, two published datasets for islet single-cell RNA-seq
from human ND and T2D donors (Segerstolpe et al. 2016; Xin et al.
2016b) and one dataset from mouse (GEO: GSE77980 (Xin et al.
2016a)) were downloaded. The RPKM values (reads per kilobase of
transcript per million mapped reads) of GABA receptor subunits from
annotated β cells were extracted and plotted.
2.5. Exocytosis Imaging
The islets were dissociated into single cells in 0.0025% trypsin in cell
dissociation buffer (Hank's based) for 3–5 min. Cells were washed once
in serum-containing medium, plated onto 22-mm polylysine-coated
coverslips and allowed to settle overnight. Adenovirus particles
adNPY-Venus (Tsuboi et al. 2006) or adNPY-mCherry (Meur et al.
2010) was added and cells were imaged 24–36 h later. Cells selected
for experiments expressed the granule marker and appeared healthy.
Cells were imaged in a standard solution containing (mM): 138 NaCl,
5.6 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.6 CaCl2, 20 D-glucose, 5 HEPES (pH 7.4 with
NaOH) (Barg et al. 2002; Gandasi and Barg 2014). For depolarization de-
pendent exocytosis experiments, the glucose concentration was 10 mM
and the solution supplemented with 2 μM forskolin and 200 μM
diazoxide, a K+-ATP-channel opener that prevents glucose-dependent
depolarization. Exocytosis was then evoked with high K+ solution
(75 mM KCl equimolarly replacing NaCl). High K+ was applied by com-
puter-timed local pressure ejection through a glass pipette similar to
those used for patch clamp. All experiments were carried out at ~32
°C. Cells were imaged using a custom-built lens-type total internal re-
flection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope based on an Axiovert 135 mi-
croscope with a 100×/1.45 objective (Carl Zeiss). Excitation was from
a DPSS laser at 491 (Cobolt, Stockholm, Sweden), controlled with an
274

 acousto-optical tunable filter (AA-Opto, France) and using dichroic
Di01-R488/561 (Semrock) and emission filter FF01-523/610 (Semrock).
Scaling was 160 nm per pixel and exposure time 100 ms per frame at 10
frames/s. Exocytosis events were found by eye. The moment of exocyto-
sis was defined as the first significant change (2 standard deviations)
from the pre-exocytosis baseline. This definition applied to both types
of events, with or without preceding flash. The decay time was then de-
fined as the time from exocytosis until the signal reached less than one
third of the amplitude of the event. Traces were read out as DF, defined
as average fluorescence in a 0.5 μm circle minus the average fluores-
cence in a surrounding annulus of 0.8 μm. The point of exocytosis was
calculated by fitting the granule fluorescence during exocytosis with a
discontinuous function (Eq. (1)), which assumes constant fluorescence
before fusion, an inverted exponential decay just after fusion, and finally
exponential decay during content release:

where t is time; c is average fluorescence in a 0.48 μm wide circle at the

τ1 and τ2 are the decay constants for the fluorescence increase after fu-
sion and content release; and t1 and t2 are the times of fusion and re-
lease, respectively.
2.6. GABA Concentration Measurement in Human Islets with GABA ELISA
The individual islets were collected (between 20 and 900 islets from
each donor) and after adding 450 μl water into Eppendorf tube contain-
ing islets, homogenized by two sessions of 10-second sonication with
1 min break between sonications, keeping the samples on ice during
the break. After 2-minute centrifugation of the homogenate at
14000 rpm, 350 μl of the supernatant were collected for subsequent
GABA concentration measurement with GABA ELISA (BA E-2500, LDN,
Germany), and 50 μl of the same supernatant were taken for protein
measurement by improved Lowry assay with the Bio-Rad DCTM Protein
Assay (USA). Obtained actual GABA concentration was normalized to
protein concentration and expressed in nmol/mg protein for each
sample.
2.7. Measurements of Insulin Secretion
Groups of 10–15 size-matched islets were preincubated for 30 min
at 37 °C in experimental buffer containing 3 mM glucose followed by
40 min incubation in 500 μl buffer containing 3 or 20 mM glucose
with or without GABA and picrotoxin. The incubation medium was sub-
sequently collected, the islets sonicated briefly (1–2 periods of 10 s) in
acidic ethanol and frozen overnight. Samples from the medium and
the islets were appropriately diluted and analyzed in duplicates for in-
sulin using an immunoassay kit from Mesoscale Discovery (Rockville,
MD, USA). Secretion was normalized to insulin content and expressed
in relation to that at 20 mM glucose. In some experiments, the islets
were placed in a closed 10-μl Teflon tubing perfusion. The chamber
was perfused with buffer at a rate of 60 μl/min (AutoMate Scientific,
Berkeley, CA). After 30 min of equilibration in buffer with 3 mM glucose,
the perfusate was collected in 5-min fractions (Biocollector, Atto Corp,
Tokyo, Japan) while changing the glucose concentration, or adding
GABA or picrotoxin. Three fractions were collected for each condition
and analyzed for insulin. The results are presented as one data point
per condition, which represents the average of the last two fractions
at that condition. The first fraction was excluded since it was influenced
by the preceding condition.
2.8. Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the two-tailed unpaired
Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney test (for two groups comparison),
one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on ranks (for multiple
comparisons) using GraphPad Prism 7 software (GraphPad Software,
USA). The Tukey method was used to detect the outliers. P values b
0.05 were considered statistically significant. All data are presented as
mean ± SEM and plotted with GraphPad Prism 7.
3. Results
3.1. GABA-Activated Currents in Intact Human Islets
We used whole-cell patch-clamp (Hamill et al. 1981) to study single
GABAA receptor channels in intact islets from nondiabetic (ND) and
clinically diagnosed T2D donors (Table S1). The GABAA receptor is a
transmembrane, pentameric plasma membrane protein complex that
contains an integral Cl− ion channel. The channel is normally closed
but it opens when GABA binds to the GABAA receptor. The current
through a single GABAA receptor is the single-channel current and is
manifested in the recording by a deflection (step-opening) from base-
line where the channels are closed (Eghbali et al. 1997). Cells were
blindly selected for recording (Fig. 1a; Jin et al. 2011, Jin et al. 2013)
and the cell-type was determined post-hoc by single-cell RT-PCR analy-
sis of the islet hormone transcripts; glucagon (for α cells), insulin (β
cells) and somatostatin (δ cells). GABA-activated currents were re-
corded from 383 cells in islets from 109 donors (Fig. 1a, b), and 93
cells expressing single hormone transcript could be determined from
38 ND and 6 T2D donors (Fig. 1c, Fig. S1a). The majority of identified
cells are β cells (Fig. S1a). Cell capacitance measurement revealed no
difference in the median size between different cell-types or between
cells from ND and T2D islets (Fig. S1b). While the cell-type could not
be defined from the size of the cell, the interstitial GABA-activated cur-
rent characteristics were cell-type specific (Fig. 1b). The GABAA receptor
single-channel currents had low open probability in the α cells in stark
contrast to the β cells were the channel openings were prominent. In δ
cells, transient, synaptic-like currents were recorded (Fig. S1c).
3.2. GABA-Activated Receptors in β Cells
We further analyzed the GABA-activated single-channel currents in
the β cells. GABAA receptors (GABAARs) can be characterized based on
conductance, current kinetics and the receptor′s pharmacology. We
identified two types of GABAARs and termed them islet-GABAA receptor
I and II, iGABAARI and iGABAARII respectively, based on the single-chan-
nel current distributions (Fig. 1d). The currents were inhibited by picro-
toxin, a specific GABAAR antagonist. Representative traces of the
currents recorded from ND or T2D islet β cells activated by sequentially
applied GABA concentrations are shown in Fig. 1e. When activated by
interstitial GABA, the single-channel current varied linearly with the
membrane potential and the cord conductance for the iGABAARI and
RII channels were 37 pS and 76 pS (Fig. 1f), respectively.
GABA is released from β and δ cells (Braun et al. 2010) and the inter-
stitial concentration will vary with the physiological activity of the islet.
In plasma from ND and T2D donors the GABA concentration was similar,
516 ± 30 nM (n = 10) and 480 ± 28 nM (n = 13), respectively. Cur-
rently it is not known what the effective GABA concentration is in the is-
lets. We, therefore, applied a range of GABA concentrations to islets,
from 1 to 104 nM, to open the channels and examined the effects of
GABA on the channel activation, conductance and kinetics (Figs. 1, 2).
In ≥10 nM GABA, GABA-activated Cl− currents were evoked. The aver-
age conductance of single iGABAAR channel was generally not depen-
dent on the GABA concentration (Fig. 1g) but, interestingly, the
100 nM GABA-activated iGABAARI conductance (55 ± 5 pS) recorded
in islets from T2D donors was significantly larger than the conductance
275

 276
S.V. Korol et al. / EBioMedicine 30 (2018) 273–282
 recorded in islets from ND donors (41 ± 3 pS, P b 0.05). All GABA-acti-
vated currents were inhibited by the GABAAR antagonists picrotoxin
(100 μM) or SR95531 (100 μM). We also examined effects of tempera-
ture on the channels as GABAARs commonly have a number of
subconductance states (Gage and Chung 1994; Verdoorn et al. 1990).
The average conductance of single iGABAARI channels was temperature
dependent and increased by a factor of 1.3 in interstitial, 10 and 100 nM
GABA as the temperature was raised from RT (20–22 °C) to 34 °C
(Fig. 1g).
The membrane potential of β cells can vary over a wide range (Braun
et al. 2010; Rorsman and Braun 2013). We examined how the open
probability (Po) of the iGABAAR channels varied with membrane poten-
tial displacement away from the chloride reversal potential (ECl
−). We
have previously shown for GABAAR channels that it is the displacement
from the chloride reversal, and not the exact potential value, that deter-
mines the conductance characteristics (Birnir et al. 1994). The Po of the
channels is related to both the frequency of openings and the mean
open time (To) for the channels. The average Po of the GABA-activated
iGABAARs was potential dependent and increased with positive mem-
brane potential displacements (Fig. 1h). The mean current (Imean) is re-
lated to both the conductance and the Po of the channels. It is the
ensemble of GABA-activated currents in the cell. The Imean was out-
wardly rectifying (Fig. 1i) revealing that the iGABAAR effect on the
membrane
potential
increases
as
the
membrane
potential
is
depolarized past the ECl
−. At these potentials, opening of iGABAAR chan-
nels promotes repolarization of the membrane potential whereas at po-
tentials more negative than ECl
−, activation of iGABAAR channels
contributes to the excitation of the β cells. We further examined if the
Imean and the Po of the channels were regulated by either GABA concen-
tration or T2D (pipette potential Vp = −70 mV). Interestingly, both
100 nM GABA and T2D significantly (P b 0.05) enhanced Po (Fig. 1j)
and Imean (Fig. 1k) of the iGABAAR channels.
3.3. In Diabetes iGABAARs are Supersensitive to GABA
As the effects on Po and Imean can only be partially explained by mod-
ulation of channel conductance we examined further the kinetic prop-
erties of the channels. GABA increased the rate (frequency) of
iGABAAR channel openings in islets from both ND and T2D donors but
did not affect the mean open times To. Importantly, the frequency of
openings was significantly increased in islets from T2D donors resulting
in higher apparent affinity for GABA (Fig. 2). At saturating GABA concen-
trations, the channels desensitized i.e. stopped working (Fig. 2). The
data could be fitted with a model (Fig. 2a) comprised of 3 closed states:
a GABA-free (C), GABA-bound state primed for channel opening (C*)
and a GABA-bound desensitized state (Cd). The model has two open
states where of one (OS) represents spontaneous openings and the
other (OG) occurs in the GABA-primed state. For iGABAARI, the maximal
rate (frequency) of channel openings was in 100 nM GABA, but the
opening rate decreased at micromolar concentrations (Fig. 2b, c). The
apparent affinity for GABA (Ka) at room temperature (RT) was 20 nM
for iGABAARI, which was significantly lower (P b 0.05) than 65 nM for
iGABAARII. Both channel types have similar equilibrium constants for
desensitization (Kd), in the micromolar range. The To of iGABAARI was
3-fold lower (P b 0.05) than for iGABAARII and this is reflected in the
closing rates (kc). The opening rates of the iGABAARs were similar in in-
terstitial and 10 nM GABA suggesting that the interstitial GABA concen-
tration under our experimental conditions is about 10 nM. Raising the
temperature to 34 °C resulted in a 2-fold reduction in To for iGABAARI
but no change in opening rate. However, for iGABAARII, raising the tem-
perature to 34 °C had no effect on To but did increase Ka 23-fold and
shifted the peak opening rate from 100 nM to 1 μM GABA (Fig. 2a, c). In-
terestingly, this shift in GABA activation was associated with the ap-
pearance of a non-zero baseline in the opening rate in the [GABA]
range 10–100 nM, indicating the presence of spontaneous channel
openings.
In islets from T2D donors, the data were described by the same
model and had similar To and Kd as those from ND donors (Fig. 2d, e).
However, the Ka for GABA activation of the iGABAARs was reduced at
RT by 6-fold for iGABAARI and at 34 °C by ~3-fold for iGABAARI and
300-fold for iGABAARII. In addition, the opening rate of the iGABAARI
was significantly higher than recorded in islets from ND donors. To-
gether the results show that in T2D the functional response of the
iGABAARI and II in pancreatic islets is altered. Furthermore, the total
GABA content in ND and T2D islets was significantly different (P b
0.05) being 7.7±2.2 nmol/mg protein (n = 7) and 1.6±0.5 nmol/mg
protein (n = 6), respectively.
We investigated further at the single cell transcriptome level if
changes in expression of iGABAAR subunits had occurred. Data from sin-
gle cell RNA sequencing (GEO: GSE81608 and ArrayExpress: E-MTAB-
5060) shown in Fig. 2f revealed that the profile of the expressed
GABAA subunits is altered in β cells from T2D (n = 395 cells) as com-
pared to ND (n = 376 cells) donors. The classical GABAB receptor is
not expressed in the β cells as only one, GABABR1, of the required two
subunits of the dimeric GABAB receptor (Xu et al. 2014) was expressed
in the cells (Fig. S2a).
3.4. GABA Shapes Insulin Exocytosis and Secretion
We examined the effect of GABA on insulin granule exocytosis using
the total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy on cells ex-
pressing the fluorescent granule-marker neuropeptide-Y (NPY)-Venus.
Depolarization of the cells by local application of 75 mM K+ caused a

appearance of fluorescence when NPY-Venus was released (Figs. 3a–

sized cells was observed in control (3.5 ± 0.4·10−3·μm−2·s−1, n =
6), which decreased to ~150 granules/min in presence of 100 nM
GABA (2.5 ± 0.6 ·10−3·μm−2·s−1, p b 0.05, n = 7, Figs. 3c–e). The
loss of NPY-Venus from individual granules was somewhat faster in
presence of GABA compared with control (0.86 ± 0.09 vs 1.28 ±
0.13 s, P b 0.024, Wilcoxon Signed Rank test; n = 119 and 96 granules;
Fig. 3c, f, and g). Release was usually preceded by a transient fluores-

 opening of a fusion pore that is too narrow to allow peptide release
(Obermuller et al. 2005; Tsuboi and Rutter 2003). No changes were de-
tected in the rising phase of the fluorescence signal, which reflects the
fusion pore life-time (Fig. 3f).
We also recorded exocytosis in cells bathed in 20 mM glucose for
N10 min, as during 2nd phase insulin secretion. In cells from two ND do-
nors, exocytosis was 0.11 ± 0.02·10−3·μm−2·s−1 (n = 7), correspond-
ing to ~7 granules per minute. With GABA present, exocytosis decreased
slightly to 0.095 ± 0.01·10−3·μm−2·s−1 (~5 granules/min, P b 0.05, n
= 6). A similar effect was seen in islet cells from one T2D donor with
0.031 ± 0.010·10−3·μm−2·s−1 (~2 granules/min) in control compared
with 0.019 ± 0.008·10−3·μm−2·s−1 (~1 granules/min) with GABA (p b
0.05, Fig. 3h, i). Taken together these data suggest that GABA decreases
the rate of exocytosis in β cells. In glucose-stimulated islets, the modu-
latory effect of GABA on insulin secretion was more complex (Fig. S3)
and is in line with the influence of paracrine factors (Caicedo 2013)
and differences in electrophysiological behavior of isolated versus islet
β-cells (Rorsman and Ashcroft 2018).

 3.5. iGABAARs are Selectively Modulated by Drugs
Many central nervous system (CNS) drugs commonly used clinically
are thought to target only neuronal GABAARs (Hanson et al. 2008; Olsen
and Sieghart 2009; Sieghart 2015). We examined if a benzodiazepine
(diazepam), anesthetics (propofol, pentobarbital) and a hypnotic
(zolpidem) also modulated the iGABAARs (Fig. 4a). Diazepam and
zolpidem bind to receptors containing the γ2 GABAAR subunit while
zolpidem is, additionally, highly selective for receptors containing the
α1 GABAAR subunit. Propofol and pentobarbital potentiate most CNS
GABAAR subtypes. In the human islets, importantly, only zolpidem
(100 or 200 nM) did not modulate the iGABAAR currents (Fig. 4a). The
results are in agreement with the GABAAR subunit expression profile
of the β cells (see Fig. 2f).
We further examined if GLP-1, a peptide secreted by L-cells in the
gut and enhances insulin secretion, modulated the iGABAARs. GLP-1
(50 pM) increased the frequency of the iGABAARI channel openings
(Fig. 4b). Remarkably, the current enhancement by GLP-1 remained, al-
beit at a reduced level, when the GLP-1 application was terminated
(Fig. 4b). This long-lasting current enhancement was also recorded for
iGABAARs in an islet from T2D individual.
4. Discussion
The results identify the physiological, submicromolar GABA concen-
tration range in human islets and characterize unique human β cell-spe-
cific GABAARs, that, when activated, decrease the rate of exocytosis in β
cells and modulate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. We further
show that common CNS drugs like diazepam, propofol, pentobarbital
but not zolpidem, modulate the receptors and, thereby, highlight the
caution that must be taken when considering these types of CNS medi-
cines for people with diabetes. The results also provide a rationale for
developments with focus on β cell-specific GABAAR drugs. In accor-
dance with the decreased total GABA content in islets from T2D donors,
the induction of the very high-affinity iGABAAR in T2D is likely to be a
consequence of the disease and a compensatory response to maintain
normal islet functions.
Fig. 4. The modulation of iGABAAR mediated single-channel currents in β cells by GABAAR modulators and GLP-1. (a) Top: iGABAAR-mediated single-channel currents recorded from islet β
cells were enhanced by diazepam (1 μM), propofol (10 μM) and pentobarbital (100 μM) but not zolpidem (200 nM). Picrotoxin (100 μM) and SR95531 (100 μM) inhibited the iGABAAR
currents. Lower panel: Diazepam (n = 5), propofol (n = 4) and pentobarbital (n = 4) but not zolpidem (n = 4) significantly increased the mean single-channel current (Imean) and
opening frequency of iGABAARs (*P b 0.05; **P b 0.01, Mann-Whitney test). Data were presented as mean ± SEM. (b) Top: iGABAAR-mediated single-channel currents recorded from a
β cell were potentiated by GLP-1 (50 pM) in the presence of GABA (10 nM). The enhanced channel activity was maintained after GLP-1 washout (post GLP-1) and picrotoxin (PTX;
100 μM) inhibited the currents. Lower panel: The opening frequency of iGABAARI channels was significantly increased by GLP-1 and after GLP-1 washout it remained significantly
higher than that before GLP-1 application (*P b 0.05, n = 6). Each cell is identified by a specific symbol and connected by dashed lines (black, ND; red, T2D). One-way ANOVA multiple
comparisons versus control group (before GLP-1 application; Dunn's method). The application of GLP-1 and the following washout did not significantly change the single-channel
conductance of either iGABAARI or iGABAARII (n = 5). Data were presented as mean ± SEM.

 The optimal GABA concentrations for active iGABAARs ranged from
100 nM to submicromolar GABA. Our model exhibits GABA-primed
closed and GABA-desensitized states like those seen in models for neu-
ronal GABAAR-mediated currents (Jones and Westbrook 1995;
Lindquist et al. 2005) albeit with 100-fold higher affinity for GABA in
the human islets. In T2D, the iGABAARs, high conductance and very ef-
fective channels, become supersensitive to GABA. In the human β cells
only two functional subtypes of GABAARs were identified in contrast
to the plethora of receptor types expressed in the brain. In islets from
ND donors, the pentameric iGABAAR consist of a combination of α2,
α5, β3, γ2 subunits. Clearly a number of combinations are possible
but the pharmacological profile of the receptors is consistent with
α2β3γ2, α5β3γ2 and α2α5β3γ2 (Olsen and Sieghart 2009). The recep-
tors interact with the intracellular milieu that can further shape their
characteristics as was apparent by the long-lasting effects of the GLP-
1. In islets from individuals with T2D, potential subtypes include the
α2β3γ2 but also α3β3γ2 and α2α3β3γ2 iGABAAR receptors. GABA-ac-
tivated Cl− currents have not been recorded in β cells in rodent islets, so
far (Jin et al. 2013; Rorsman et al. 1989; Soltani et al. 2011; Wendt et al.
2004). However, in mouse β cells, Ca2+ transients are modulated by
GABAAR agonists (Soltani et al. 2011) and single-cell transcriptome
analysis has detected GABAAR subunit genes in mouse islet β cells
(GEO: GSE77980, Fig. S2b). The most prominent genes were α4β3δ
whereas no or very low level of the γ2 subunit was detected resulting
in, potentially, high-affinity GABAARs but with different pharmacologi-
cal profile from the human receptors e.g. being insensitive to benzodiaz-
epines (Olsen and Sieghart 2009). Single-cell sequencing further
showed that human β cells express only one of the two obligatory
GABABR subunits in contrasts to e.g. mice where both subunits are
expressed (GEO: GSE77980, Fig. S2c), suggesting that in human β
cells, GABA signaling is dominated by the GABAAR.
Together, our findings identify β cells-specific high-affinity GABAAR
subtypes and the physiologically relevant GABA concentrations in
human islets that together modulate insulin secretion. How activating
iGABAARs alters cellular signaling and why the GABA content in islets
from patients with T2D is reduced is currently not known and needs
to be resolved in future experiments.
