Xenotransplantation is a promising strategy to alleviate the shortage of organs for human
transplantation. In addition to the concerns about pig-to-human immunological compatibility,
the risk of cross-species transmission of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) has
impeded the clinical application of this approach. We previously demonstrated the feasibility
of inactivating PERV activity in an immortalized pig cell line. We now confirm that PERVs
infect human cells, and we observe the horizontal transfer of PERVs among human cells.
Using CRISPR-Cas9, we inactivated all of the PERVs in a porcine primary cell line and
generated PERV-inactivated pigs via somatic cell nuclear transfer. Our study highlights the
value of PERV inactivation to prevent cross-species viral transmission and demonstrates
the successful production of PERV-inactivated animals to address the safety concern in
clinical xenotransplantation.
T
he shortage of human organs and tissues
for transplantation represents one of the
most substantial unmet medical needs (1).
Xenotransplantation holds great promise.
Porcine organs are considered to be fa-
vorable resources for xenotransplantation be-
cause they are similar to human organs in size
and function, and pigs can be bred in large
numbers (2).
However, the clinical use of porcine organs
has been hindered by immunological incom-
patibilities (2) and by the potential risk of porcine
endogenous retrovirus (PERV) transmission (3).
PERVs are gamma retroviruses found in the ge-
nome of all pig strains and can be vertically trans-
ferred through inheritance (4). Although, to date,
no study hasshown PERV transmission to humans
in a clinical setting, it has been demonstrated that
PERVs can infect human cells (3, 5) and integrate
into the human genome in cell culture (6). PERV
integration could potentially lead to immuno-
deficiency and tumorigenesis, as reported with
other retroviruses (7, 8).
We recently demonstrated a method to in-
activate all 62 copies of PERVs in an immortal-
ized porcine cell line (PK15) and thus eliminate
PERV transmission to human cells (5). In the
present study, we adopted a strategy to conduct
multiplexed genome engineering to inactivate
PERV activity in a primary porcine fibroblast cell
line, after which we used the modified fibroblasts
to produce embryos through somatic cell nuclear
transfer (SCNT) and then transferred the SCNT
embryos into surrogate sows. With the use of
such an approach, we successfully generated
PERV-inactivated pigs.
We previously demonstrated the transmission
of PERVs from an immortalized pig epithelial
cell line, PK15, to green fluorescent protein
(GFP)–labeled human embryonic kidney 293T
(HEK293T-GFP) cells after coculturing them
for 1 week (5). We wondered whether PERVs re-
main active and propagate in human cells. To
detect this, we monitored PERV copy number in
both a population and clones of PERV-infected
HEK293T-GFP cells (i-HEK293T-GFP) for more
than 4 months and observed that PERV copy
number increased over time (Fig. 1A and fig. S1B),
as determined by droplet digital polymerase chain
reaction (ddPCR). Consistent with previous re-
ports (3, 9), we detected that both subtypes PERV-A
and PERV-B were present in the infected human
cells (fig. S1B), which confirms thatthey are human-
tropic. We did not detect PERV-C in either PK15
or i-HEK293T-GFP cells (fig. S1, A and B). To
determine whether the PERVs integrate into the
human genome or stay episomal in the infected
human cells, we performed junction capture
sequencing of the infected clonal i-HEK293T-GFP
cells. We detected novel PERV junctions in the
human genome and observed that they are over-
represented in intragenic regions and in active
chromatin areas (Fig. 1B and fig. S2, A and B).
The increased copy number of PERVs in i-
HEK293T-GFP clones can be caused by intra-
cellular transposition or by intercellular PERV
transmission among human cells. To clarify this,
we examined whether infected human cells
could transmit PERVs to wild-type (WT) human
cells. We cocultured clonal i-HEK293T-GFP cells
with WT HEK293T cells for 2 weeks and sub-
sequently checked PERV elements in the co-
cultured WT clones via PCR. We detected the
robust presence of PERV elements inWT HEK293T
cells with no history of contact with porcine cells
(Fig. 1C and fig. S2C). The percentage of infected
WT HEK293T cells varies from 20 to 97% (Fig.
1D), depending on different parental i-HEK293T-
GFP clones in the coculture. We concluded from
our observations that infected human cells can
transmit PERVs to previously unexposed human
cells.
Generating PERV-inactivated pigs involves
construction of primary porcine cells devoid of
PERV activity, which can be cloned via SCNT to
produce porcine embryos. We tested whether
we could use the same strategy that we used
previously in PK15 (5) to inactivate the PERV
activities in a primary porcine fetal fibroblast
cell line (hereafter denoted as FFF3). We first
aimed to map and characterize the PERVs present
in the FFF3 genome. We detected 25 copies of
functional PERVs, as determined by ddPCR on
the reverse transcriptase (pol) gene (fig. S3). The
detected PERV copy number was close to the
sum of 10 copies of the PERV-A env gene, 14
copies of the PERV-B env gene, and 0 copies of
the PERV-C env gene that we identified in the
genome (fig.S3)by ddPCR.We usedwhole-genome
sequencing to further detect one additional copy
of truncated PERV-B that was not detectable by
ddPCR. We used hybridization capture followed
by sequencing to map PERVs copies into the
genome (Fig. 2A and fig. S4). To target these
PERVs for inactivation, we designed two CRISPR
guide RNAs (gRNAs) specific to the catalytic core
of the PERV pol gene (fig. S5). After treating a
population of FFF3 cells with CRISPR-Cas9 and
the two gRNAs for 12 days, we observed 37% PERV
pol inactivation. Notably, we observed a bimodal
distribution of targeting efficiency among sin-
gle FFF3 cells after treatment, resembling our
previous results obtained with PK15 cells (5).
About 35% of single cells had high editing efficiency
(>90%) and 61% had low editing efficiency (<20%)
(Fig. 2B). Unfortunately, despite the presence of
highly modified cells in the population, we could
not grow the single-cell clones with >90% PERV
editing efficiency.
We hypothesized that simultaneous DNA cleav-
ages by Cas9 at multiple PERV sites in the FFF3
genome trigger DNA damage–induced senescence
or apoptosis; hence, we could not obtain the highly
modified FFF3 clones. Through screening of dif-
ferent anti-apoptotic strategies (figs. S6 and S7),
we observed that, during genetic modification, the
application of a cocktail containing p53 inhibitor,
pifithrin alpha (PFTa), and basic fibroblast growth
factor (bFGF) significantly increased the aver-
age targeting efficiency of the resulting FFF3

 populations {fig. S6A [ANOVA (analysis of var-
iance), P = 0.00002] and fig. S6B}. Using this
optimized cocktail, we were able to grow 100%
PERV-inactivated FFF3 cells (PERV-inactivated
FFF3) from the population treated with CRISPR-
Cas9 (Fig. 2, C and D).
Having confirmed that we genetically mutated
PERV pol in the genome, we performed RNA
sequencing (fig. S8) on PERV-inactivated FFF3
clones and confirmed that all pol transcripts had
been mutated. Furthermore, we examined wheth-
er the genome-wide disruption of PERV pol would
eliminate in vitro production of PERVs from FFF3.
We could not detect reverse transcriptase activity
of PERVs in the cell culture supernatant of the
PERV-inactivated FFF3 (fig. S9), suggesting that
no viral particles are secreted by the modified cells.
We next sought to examine the off-target effects
of CRISPR-Cas9 in the PERV-inactivated FFF3. We
performed karyotyping of eight PERV-inactivated
FFF3 clones and observed that five carried chro-
mosomal abnormalities. Of note, the translocation
sites in the genome tend to correlate with pres-
ence of PERV cutting sites, which suggests that
CRISPR-Cas9 on-target toxicity may contribute
to the translocations observed (fig. S10A). The
remaining three PERV-inactivated FFF3 clones
carry normal chromosomal structures (fig. S10B).
To examine chromosomal integrity with higher
resolution, we performed PERV genomic junction
sequencing on the three normal karyotype clones
to examine potential deletions between Cas9-
induced double-strand breaks. All 21 tested junc-
tions remained intact (fig. S11), which indicates no
Cas9-induced macrodeletions in these regions.
Therefore, we concluded that we could obtain
PERV-inactivated FFF3 clones without detect-
able structural variations.
Having obtained PERV-inactivated FFF3 cells,
we attempted to produce PERV-inactivated em-
bryos via SCNT. For every round of embryogenesis,
~20 to 40% of the constructed PERV-inactivated
embryos reached the blastocyst stage after being
cultured for 6 days (materials and methods), which
is within the normal range of porcine SCNT
efficiency. We observed normal 64–cell stage
blastocyst structure and validated the pluripotency
of inner cell mass (detected by SOX2 antibody) on
day 6 (fig. S12A). We performed genomic deep
sequencing to check the PERV pol genotypes in
embryos and confirmed 100% PERV-inactivation
efficiency (fig. S12B).
Next, we transferred the PERV-inactivated em-
bryos into surrogate sows that are free of PERV-C
and present a total PERV copy number of 12 to 30
(fig. S13A). We detected pregnancy rates of 75%
[33 of 44 (33/44)], 63% (28/44), and 52% (23/44)
for sows with embryos created using PERV-
inactivated FFF3 cells at day 23, 51, and 70, re-
spectively, and 100% (5/5) for sows with embryos

(A) PERV copy number in infected human cells increases over time when
cocultured with PK15 cells. Human HEK293T-GFP cells were cocultured
with equivalent numbers of porcine PK15 cells for 1 week. HEK293T-GFP cells
that did not have any contact with PK15 cells were used as a negative
control (negative). Error bars indicate SD. (B) Detection of PERV
insertion sites in the human genome. Among the 22 PERV insertion sites
detected by inverse PCR, 15 were mapped to the intragenic region. We
tested a portion of the intragenic hits and validated 7 out of 12 by junction
PCR (shown here). The 30–base pair human genomic sequences are
shown in blue, whereas the PERV long terminal repeats are shown in red.
(C) Detection of human-to-human PERV transmission. Individual clones of
HEK293Tcells were grown from the single cells isolated from the coculture of
i-HEK293T-GFP cells with HEK293T cells through flow cytometry. The PCR
gel image shows that three out of four randomly tested HEK293Tclones were
infected and contained PERV sequences (PERV pol, env, and gag) but no
sequence of GFP or pig genomic DNA (tested by pig-specific GGTA). Sample
order is as follows: (1) HEK293T clone 1; (2) HEK293T clone 2; (3) HEK293T
clone 3; (4) HEK293Tclone 4; (5) HEK293T-GFP control; (6) i-HEK293T-GFP;
(7) PK15 WT; and (8) negative control. (D) Four different i-HEK293T-GFP
clones have different infectious potential. Four infected parental i-HEK293T-GFP
clones are cocultured with WT HEK293T cells. The PERV copy numbers of
the four parental i-HEK293T-GFP clones are 15, 28, 27
, and 28, respectively. The
percentages of the infected WT HEK293T clones from the coculture of
i-HEK293T-GFP and WT HEK293T cells varied from 20 to 97%. Primers

Fetuses at pregnancy date 50 were analyzed; all
PERV-inactivated fetuses showed 100% PERV
inactivation (fig. S12, C and D) and similar PERV
copy numbers to those of WT FFF3 cells (fig.
S13B). Despite the lower pregnancy efficiency,
which is commonly observed in transgenic pig
production (10), we successfully produced puta-
tive PERV-inactivated pigs (Fig. 3A and fig. S14).
In terms of SCNT efficiency, we did not observe
any difference between PERV-inactivated cells and
WT cells. The ratios of piglets born to the num-
ber of embryos transferred are similar for PERV-
inactivated cells (0.9%) and WT cells (0.8%). To
test PERV inactivation in these pigs, we isolated
genomic DNA from both the bulk cells and single-
cell clones derived from these pigs and observed
that all pigs exhibited ~100% PERV inactivation at
the genomic DNA level (Fig. 3B and fig. S15, A and
B). In addition, we observed that the copy number
of PERVs in the generated pigs stays close to
25, reconfirming that there is no reinfection (fig.
S15C). We further isolated total RNAs from a va-
riety of tissues of the pigs and confirmed ~100%
PERV inactivation at the mRNA level (Fig. 3C). We
performed karyotyping and did not detect ab-
normal structural changes in the PERV-inactivated

the PERVs in FFF3, single cells were sorted and immediately genotyped.
We observed a bimodal distribution of PERV targeting frequencies among
single cells (top), similar to that seen for the PK15 clones (5). 100%
PERV-inactivated FFF3 cells were present among the single cells that we
directly genotyped. However, this pattern changed after expansion of
the single cells (bottom). Among the single-cell clones, we only obtained
those with lower efficiency (≤39%; the average targeting efficiency in
the population was 37%), not the ones with 100% PERV inactivation (bottom).

reatment with PFTa and bFGF
sustained the growth of highly modified FFF3 clones. The combined use of a
p53 inhibitor, PFTa, and a growth factor, bFGF, rescued the highly modified
cells. A population of FFF3 was treated with PFTa and bFGF during the gene
editing experiment (materials and methods), after which single cells were
sorted for direct genotyping and colony growth, followed by genotyping. Both
the single cells and expanded clones showed similar distribution in PERV
targeting efficiency, and highly modified clones survived under this condition.

clones were achieved from the PFTa- and bFGF-treated FFF3 population. The

pol loci after CRISPR-Cas9 treatment. The y axis indicates PERV copy number;
the x axis indicates the relative locations of the indels within the PERV loci.

 pigs (fig. S16). The PERV-inactivated pig produc-
tion is robust in that, to date, we have produced
37 PERV-inactivated piglets from 17 sows (200
to 300 embryos transferred per sow), 15 piglets
remain alive, and the oldest healthy animals
are 4 months old. We are conducting long-term
studies to monitor the effect of PERV inactivation
and gene editing on these animals as they age
and mature.
We observed in our studies that PERVs can be
transmitted from pig to human cells and also
transmitted among human cells in vitro. These
results substantiate the risk of cross-species viral
transmission in the context of xenotransplanta-
tion. To work toward eliminating this risk, we
used a combination of CRISPR-Cas9, apoptosis
inhibitor, and growth factor to generate PERV-
inactivated primary porcine cell lines. With these
cell lines, we produced PERV-inactivated porcine
embryos, fetuses, and live pigs.
In this study, we discovered that treatment
with p53 inhibitor can mitigate the stress from
multiplex DNA damage during multiplexible ge-
nome engineering and support clonal expansion
of 100% PERV-inactivated cells. Although in this
paper we have focused on the applications to
xenotransplantation, we envision, more generally,
that the synergistic combination of CRISPR-Cas
technology with anti-apoptosis treatment may also
be used to enable large-scale genome engineering
in primary cells for a broad range of applications,
including pathway engineering and modifications
of other genetic repetitive elements of biological
interest.
Although it is still unclear whether PERVs
infect humans in vivo, our study shows that
PERV-infected human cells pass the PERVs
robustly to fresh human cells that have no prior
exposure to pig cells. Therefore, our data sub-
stantiates the value of PERV inactivation for safe
xenotransplantation practice. The physiological
functions of endogenous retrovirus, which exists
in all mammalian species, remain largely un-
known. Further studies on our PERV-inactivated
pigs will shed light on the endogenous retrovirus
functionalities in relation to the hosts. Most im-
portantly, the PERV-inactivated pig can serve as
a foundation pig strain, which can be further
engineered to provide safe and effective organ
and tissue resources for xenotransplantation.
