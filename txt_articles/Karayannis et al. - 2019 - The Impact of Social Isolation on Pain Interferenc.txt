Abstract
Background Evidence suggests social interactions play 
an important role in pain perception.
Purpose The aim of this study was to determine whether 
social isolation (SI) in people with persistent pain deter-
mines pain interference (PI) and physical function over time.
Methods Patients seeking care at a tertiary pain man-
agement referral center were administered the Patient 
Reported Outcome Measurement Information System 
(PROMIS®) SI, PI, physical function, depression, 
and average pain intensity item banks at their initial 
consultation and subsequent visits as part of their 
routine clinical care. We used a post hoc simulation 
of an experiment using propensity score matching 
(n = 4,950) and carried out a cross-lagged longitudi-
nal analysis (n = 312) of retrospective observational 
data.
Results Cross-lagged longitudinal analysis showed 
that SI predicted PI at the next time point, above and 
beyond the effects of pain intensity and covariates, but 
not vice versa.
Conclusions These data support the importance of SI 
as a factor in pain-related appraisal and coping and 
demonstrate that a comprehensive assessment of the 
individuals’ social context can provide a better under-
standing of the differential trajectories for a person 
living with pain. Our study provides evidence that the 
impact of pain is reduced in individuals who perceive 
a greater sense of inclusion from and engagement with 
others. This study enhances the understanding of how 
social factors affect pain and have implications for how 
the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions may be 
improved. Therapeutic interventions aimed at increas-
ing social connection hold merit in reducing the impact 
of pain on engagement with activities.

 Introduction
Experts within the fields of health sociology and popu-
lation health are debating the extent to which socioeco-
nomic position drives physical and mental health, or vice 
versa [1]. For example, a large-scale Swedish study exam-
ined the effects of the social environment at a population 
health level and demonstrated that low neighborhood 
social capital and general trust were associated with 
higher rates of psychosomatic symptoms, musculoskel-
etal pain, and depression [2]. Through the lens of social 
health selection, differences in socioeconomic situation 
(i.e., social isolation [SI], emotional support, ability, and 
satisfaction to participate in social activities) occur when 
the quality of intermediary factors are unevenly distrib-
uted between the different socioeconomic classes. In this 
scenario, the degree of SI, for example, would induce a 
higher or lower prevalence of physical or mental health 
problems. In contrast, through the lens of physical and 
mental health selection, differences in physical health 
(i.e., physical function [PF], pain interference [PI], 
fatigue, sleep disturbance) or mental health (i.e., depres-
sion, anxiety, anger, self-efficacy) occur when the quality 
of intermediary factors is unevenly distributed between 
the different physical and mental health classes. In this 
scenario, the degree of PF (physical health domain) or 
depression (mental health domain), for example, would 
induce a higher or lower prevalence of one’s ability and 
satisfaction to participate in social activities (social 
health/situation). While the inter-relationship between 
physical, mental, and social health is likely nonlinear and 
context dependent, the purpose of this study was to help 
inform this “causal relationship” debate.
Evidence within the fields of pain and rehabilitation 
science suggests social interactions play an important 
role in both the stress response and perception of pain. 
SI in early life leads to altered hormonal stress responses 
and more pronounced anxiety in adult (rodent) individ-
uals, and social support acts as a buffer against stress [3]. 
Aslund et al. [2] identified that social distress heightened 
sensitivity to physical pain. Eisenberger et al. [4] found 
that socially excluded individuals responded to unpleas-
ant heat stimuli with lower pain thresholds. People with 
rheumatoid arthritis and low levels of social support at 
baseline experienced higher levels of pain intensity at the 
3- and 5-year follow-up [5], and in people with chronic 
musculoskeletal pain, an association was found between 
perceived social support and PI [6].
Depressive symptoms are an important factor to con-
sider in interpreting the link between social and physical 
health. Individuals with low back pain (LBP) and higher 
levels of baseline depression experienced a slower recov-
ery process [7]. Individuals with depressive symptoms 
and acute and subacute episodes of LBP were more 
likely to have persistent pain in the 6-month follow-up [8]. 
A lagged reciprocal link was also discovered between LBP 
and depressive symptoms [9]. Collectively, these studies, 
which have examined data across population health, pre-
clinical, experimental pain, and clinical pain levels, lend 
support to the perspective that SI has detrimental effects 
on an individual’s perception of pain and subsequent cop-
ing responses.
Our primary aim of this study was to characterize the 
relationship between the level of SI in people with per-
sistent musculoskeletal pain with the level of PI and PF 
over time. Our secondary aim was to identify the pro-
cesses that help to explain the relationship between SI 
and physical health. Our primary hypothesis was that 
people living with persistent pain who reported higher 
levels of SI at the initiation of treatment would have 
higher levels of PI and lower levels of PF over the course 
of short-term care. Given the expectation that depressive 
symptoms have shown relationships with both pain and 
function in prior studies, our secondary hypothesis was 
that depressive symptoms would mediate the relation-
ship between SI and physical health.
Methods
Participants and Clinical Environment
People seeking treatment at a specialty pain manage-
ment center within an academic medical institution 
were enrolled in a learning health care system platform 
Collaborative Health Outcomes Information Registry 
(CHOIR: http://choir.stanford.edu), which adminis-
tered the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement 
Information System (PROMIS®) SI, PI, PF, and depres-
sion (D) item banks, and pain intensity (average intensity 
over the last 7 days), at the time of their initial con-
sultation visit and on subsequent visits as part of their 
routine clinical care. The patient population was a heter-
ogeneous mix of people with various persistent, noncan-
cer (musculoskeletal) pain disorders.
Routine clinical care would involve consultation and 
treatment recommendations from an interdisciplinary 
pain medicine team of physicians, psychologists, phys-
ical therapists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, 
and complex care managers. Typical treatments would 
include optimization of analgesic medications, psycho-
logical therapies (e.g., group and individual cognitive-be-
havioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, 
biofeedback training), physical therapy (e.g., recom-
mendations for an individualized therapeutic exercise 
program, yoga, and Tai Chi), interventional procedures 
(e.g., nerve blocks, radiofrequency ablation, spinal cord 
stimulators), complementary approaches (e.g., acupunc-
ture, nutraceuticals), and self-management approaches 
through pain education and experiential training (e.g., 
action planning, problem-solving, and goal setting).

 Psychometric Properties of PROMIS®
Substantial evidence supports the content, cross-
sectional, and clinical validity of PROMIS measures 
[10]. The PROMIS item banks (SI, PI, PF, and D) were 
administered using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) 
[11, 12] based on an item response theory approach for 
each patient care visit across 90 days of treatment. Rather 
than assessing a set number of items per subscale, the 
CAT approach identifies the optimal items within each 
domain based on prior responses from the respondent. 
CAT assessments are often considered desirable com-
pared with traditional standard scale assessments due to 
the smaller number of items needed for effective assess-
ment of each construct, as well as increased reliability of 
measurement [13, 14]. CHOIR includes CAT versions of 
the PROMIS measures adapted with an in-house algo-
rithm (CHOIR-CAT). CHOIR-CAT was implemented 
using the same CAT algorithm as the Northwestern 
University Assessment Center, which has provided open 
access to PROMIS instruments [12]. PROMIS measures 
are normed against the U.S. population and have a mean 
of 50 points and a standard deviation (SD) of 10 points 
[15].
The PROMIS-SI items assess an individual’s percep-
tion of being excluded, detached, disconnected from, 
unknown, or avoided by others and include the perceived 
quality of interpersonal relationships, social network, 
companionship, feeling cared for, valued, of belonging, 
and trust [16]. Validation testing of the PROMIS-Social 
Health domain framework identified seven unidimen-
sional factors (using exploratory factor analysis, con-
firmatory factor analysis, and item response theory) with 
good model fit and good evidence of criterion and con-
struct validity [17]. The PROMIS-PI item bank assesses 
the extent to which pain hinders engagement with phys-
ical, cognitive, emotional, and recreational activities, as 
well as sleep and enjoyment in life [18]. The PROMIS-PI 
has been linked for comparison with other PI legacy 
instruments [19, 20] such as the 15-item brief pain inven-
tory [21, 22] and the two-item Short-Form 36® Bodily 
Pain scale [23]. Results indicate that the PROMIS-PI 
item bank is a psychometrically sound instrument with 
regards to reliability (0.96 to 0.99 for T-score range 
50–80), construct validity, and discriminant validity 
across pain intensity, disability levels, and persistent con-
ditions (p < .0001) [18].
The PROMIS-PF item bank assesses the ability to 
carry out activities that require physical actions, ranging 
from self-care to more complex activities that require a 
combination of skills, often within a social context [24]. 
The PROMIS-PF item bank scores have been linked for 
comparison with the Medical Outcome Study Short-
Form 36 Survey (Legacy PF-10) and Health Assessment 
Questionnaire (Legacy HAQ) [20]. Compared with the 
Legacy PF-10 and HAQ, the PROMIS-PF item bank 
has demonstrated superior or equal reliability (preci-
sion) and sensitivity to change [25]. Specifically, the 
PROMIS-PF instrument demonstrated greater precision 
of 0.90 or better in comparison with the Legacy PF-10 
with a higher number of SD range of values covered. For 
example, the PROMIS-PF covered 4.8 SD (20-item static 
version) to 6.3 SD (10-item CAT version), in comparison 
with the Legacy PF-10, which covered 2.4 SD [25].
Study Design and Analysis
The design of this study incorporated a longitudinal 
assessment of retrospective observational data, which 
was approved by the Institutional Review Board at 
the Stanford University School of Medicine. We have 
attempted to address the analytical challenges involved 
with using an observational data set through a series 
of methodological approaches. Appreciating that the 
identification of correlations cannot be interpreted as 
a causal relationship, and the direction of causality is 
usually unclear, we have implemented a study design that 
allows for causal inference. First, we used a post hoc sim-
ulation of an experiment using propensity score match-
ing (PSM), and second, we carried out a cross-lagged 
longitudinal analysis.
PSM and Cross-Sectional Analysis of the Average 
Treatment Effect of the Treated
PSM is a technique used to receive causal estimates 
in settings where “treatment” has been nonrandomly 
assigned [26]. One of the benefits of the PSM approach 
is that it simulates a randomized controlled trial where 
individuals are randomly attributed to two groups—a 
treatment and a control group. The random attribution 
to the two groups allows assuming that the sociodemo-
graphic characteristics are evenly distributed between 
the two groups. The method consists of creating a post 
hoc quasi-experimental design that matches individuals 
who are similar on observable characteristics but where 
some of them have received a treatment, while the others 
have not. By pairing them, their random attribution to 
either treatment or control group is simulated [27]. In a 
true experiment, where treatment is assigned randomly, 
the probability to receive treatment is 0.5 [26, 28]. If the 
treatment was not assigned randomly (as in the case of 
our observational data), the probability is not .5. By 
means of PSM, we identify the probability that an indi-
vidual would have received treatment (as a function of 
observable covariates) and then compare the two groups.
Our treatment condition is SI. Although SI is not a 
treatment in the traditional sense, with the PSM method, 
any exposure can be modeled as treatment [29]. In the 
setting of the present analysis, the “treatment condition”

 is the exposure to high SI, and the “control condition” is 
the exposure to low SI. A formal description of this ana-
lytic approach is provided in Appendix A. The strength 
of the PSM method is that it allows the capturing of 
a potential self-selection effect into a specific SI level 
before our baseline measurement.
We adopted the nearest available match using caliper 
matching with a radius of 0.001. A first assumption cen-
tral to the PSM method is common support. Common 
support considers that the individuals’ characteristics do 
not perfectly predict their attribution to the treatment. 
This condition enables individuals with the same char-
acteristics to possibly be in either the treatment or the 
control group. Perfectly symmetrical histograms for the 
treatment and control groups indicate that the common 
support condition was met; the overlap between the two 
groups is large, and few cases are “off support” [30]. Our 
analysis reveals that our estimates are robust (Appendix 
Fig. A1).
A second assumption underlying the PSM method 
is that the treatment condition is exogenous, and thus, 
there is unconfoundedness present [28, 31]. Hence, the 
receipt of treatment does not depend on the outcomes. 
Accordingly, systematic differences in outcomes between 
the treatment group and the control group are due to the 
treatment condition. This assumption is referred to as 
the conditional independence assumption (CIA). A lim-
itation of this method is that it does not account for 
unobserved factors. We included the covariates of age, 
gender, race, ethnicity, education level, and marital sta-
tus in our selection model. Other than the directly inves-
tigated PROMIS item banks of SI, PI, PF, and D, we 
excluded additional health-related variables. Appendix 
Fig. A2 presents the standardized bias in percentages 
between the means of the treatment and control group 
for the included covariates before and after matching. 
The figure demonstrates that the matching reduced bias 
and thus improved the CIA for all covariates.
Although PSM offers a strategy to address confound-
ing in nonexperimental data, it has limitations. The main 
limitation is that it allows for confounding correction 
based on observable data (i.e., only variables in the data-
base can be included in the selection model). As a con-
sequence, nonobservable confounders are omitted, and 
their potentially biasing effect cannot be assessed [32, 33].
Cross-Lagged Longitudinal Analysis
Using the original dataset without matching including 
all observations, lagged multilevel model analysis was 
performed between SI and PI, and SI and PF. As propen-
sity scores were estimated only for baseline assessments, 
t-scores for SI were used instead for lagged analysis, with 
average pain intensity, age, gender, race, ethnicity, educa-
tion level, and marital status modeled as covariates. We 
included patients who completed at least two follow-up 
treatments within a 90-day time period for analysis. In 
using this approach, it was assumed that the lagged 
changes between time points (e.g., the change in scores 
from patients’ first assessment to their second assess-
ment, compared with the change from their second to 
third assessment) were relatively comparable with one 
another across patients. We chose this analytic approach 
for two reasons. First, there was significant asynchrony 
in terms of data collection; as most patients did not come 
in for visits or complete CHOIR assessments at regular 
intervals, there was significant variability in terms of 
the duration of time between completed assessments. 
Second, it was assumed that there would be significant 
heterogeneity in terms of treatment exposure within the 
patient sample; given the multidisciplinary nature of 
the outpatient pain center, it was possible that patients 
would receive some combination of analgesic medica-
tions, treatment from physical or occupational ther-
apy or psychology, or interventional pain procedures. 
However, this pattern of treatment exposure was likely 
to be highly variable between patients in terms of the 
scheduling and specific treatment exposure, suggesting 
that any changes in treatment would not have occurred 
in uniformly scheduled ways across patients. As a result, 
we chose to adopt an analytic approach that allowed for 
maximal inclusion of data within a relatively constrained 
time window. Mediation of depression was tested in our 
lagged models for any significant lagged direct effects 
(e.g., SI on PF or PI or vice versa), while controlling 
for scores in the endogenous variable at the previous 
time point. Our rationale for including depression as a 
potential mediator between SI and PI and SI and PF 
was based on previous studies, which have demonstrated 
that emotional distress may both arise from and disrupt 
social relationships [34].
Software
The propensity score was calculated using the program 
psmatch2 a package included in the statistical soft-
ware STATA. Correlation analyses and computation 
of descriptive statistics were performed using SPSS 
(Windows version 20, Chicago, IL, USA). Cross-
sectional path modeling and multilevel path modeling 
analyses were conducted using Mplus (Version 6.12, Los 
Angeles, CA: Muthén & Muthén).
Results
Patient Demographics and PSM
Between July 2014 and July 2016, 2,423 people with 
chronic noncancer pain completed the CHOIR surveys. 
Of these, we were able to compute propensity scores

 using baseline data for 211 patients. Separately, 312 
patients had at least two follow-up treatments over the 
course of a 90-day time period and were considered for 
longitudinal analysis (n of observations across this par-
ticipant subset in 90-day period = 794). Consequently, 
our study samples for the cross-sectional propensity 
score analysis and for the longitudinal analysis were 
4,950 and 312 patients, respectively. In regards to gen-
der, race, ethnicity, education level, and marital status, 
the sample identified as female (69.2%), Caucasian 
(67.3%), Hispanic/Latino (14.2%), with a median educa-
tion level of an associate’s degree, and married (54.5%). 
Mean and SD (M ± SD) of PROMIS measures derived 
from the initial clinic visit (n = 211) are displayed in 
Table 1 and were SI = 48.41 ± 15.79, PI = 67.47 ± 5.99, 
PF = 32.49 ± 6.00, depression = 56.82 ± 12.68, and aver-
age pain intensity = 6.39 ± 1.75.
Aim 1: The Dynamic Effects of SI on Physical Health
Our primary hypothesis was that people living with per-
sistent pain who reported higher levels of SI at the ini-
tiation of treatment would have lower levels of physical 
health (PI and PF) over the course of short-term care. 
The analysis of the average treatment effect of the treated 
indicated that patients with higher SI scores reported sig-
nificantly higher levels of PI and significantly lower lev-
els of PF (Table 2).
The first row in Table 2 shows that individuals in the 
high SI subgroup (i.e., poorer social health) have a sta-
tistically significant 4.47 points higher level of PI (i.e., 
poorer physical health) than individuals in the low SI 
subgroup. The second row shows that individuals in 
the high SI subgroup have a statistically significant 4.33 
points lower level of PF (i.e., poorer physical health) 
than individuals in the low SI subgroup. Descriptive sta-
tistics for patients at each time point within the 90-day 
window can be found in Table 3.
Cross-lagged longitudinal analysis showed that SI 
predicted PI at the next time point, above and beyond 
the effects of pain and covariates, but not vice versa 
(Fig. 1). However, there were no cross-lagged associa-
tions between PF and SI when covariates were included 
(Fig. 2). Results were modeled with average pain inten-
sity, age, gender, race, ethnicity, education level, and 
marital status as covariates. All coefficients were stand-
ardized (**p < .01, *p < .05).
Aim 2: Processes of SI and Physical Health
Our secondary hypothesis was that depression would 
mediate the relationship between SI and physical health. 
Cross-sectional mediation modeling showed that depres-
sion partially mediated the relationship between SI 
(for the PSM sample) and PF ([−0.256, −0.126] Fig. 3) 
and partially mediated the relationship between SI and 
PI ([0.152, 0.272] Fig. 4). As the effect of SI on PI was 
the only significant cross-lagged effect noted, we tested 
depressive symptoms as a potential mediator of this 
effect in the lagged models. There was a significant 
lagged effect of SI on depression scores, such that higher 
SI scores predicted higher depression scores at the next

 time point (β = 0.260, p < .001), but depression scores did 
not predict later scores on PI, above and beyond other 
variables in the model (β = −0.020, p = .75). Accordingly, 
depressive symptoms were not found to be a significant 
mediator of the effects of SI on PI in the longitudinal 
models ([−0.037, 0.027]).
Discussion
Our study provides further characterization of the causal 
relationship between SI and physical health. Social 
health/situation and its role in understanding how these 
factors influence the physical and mental health envir-
onment have been an underappreciated domain in the 
fields of rehabilitation science and pain medicine [17]. 
Moreover, as the causality between these factors may 
be bidirectional, nonexperimental studies often do not 
allow for identifying causal mechanisms. Our findings 
provide further evidence that an individual’s social 
health/situation can inform the status of an individu-
al’s physical health, using an approach that allows for 
causal inference. Notably, the findings from our PSM 
analysis suggest that individuals with high levels of SI 
have much higher levels of PI and lower levels of PF 
than individuals with low levels of SI. The effect of SI 
is slightly stronger on PI than on PF. Our longitudinal 
analysis indicates that feelings of SI predicted higher rat-
ings of pain-related interference (but not PF ratings) at 
a later time point, while neither PI nor PF was found to 
predict later ratings of SI. Whereas PF might be consid-
ered more of a measure of discrete physical abilities, our 
conceptualization of PI implicates it as a more subjec-
tive measure related to appraisal of pain as a hindrance 
to engagement with physical, cognitive, emotional, and 
recreational activities. Given our previous work demon-
strating differential pathways between PI and PF [35], it 
was expected that SI would have a stronger impact on 
PI relative to PF, which may be due to a tendency to 
appraise pain and one’s social environment in a negative 
fashion (as in depression). Interestingly, our longitudinal 
results did not implicate depressive symptoms as a sig-
nificant mediator of the effects of SI on PI, suggesting 
that SI should be considered as a parallel influence on 
PI. Overall, our findings support the relative importance 
of SI as a factor in pain-related appraisal and coping 
and demonstrate that a comprehensive assessment of the 
individual’s social context can provide a more compre-
hensive understanding of the differential trajectories for 
a person living with pain.
Our findings are consistent with other studies related 
to social and physical health in people living with chronic 
pain and also identify areas to integrate in future inves-
tigations. Evers et al. [5] have shown that the quality of 
social support obtained from one’s social network, along 
with the level of passive coping strategies, predicted 
long-term pain, and disability. Although our study did 
not investigate the role of social support, the effects of SI 
may be interpreted along the same lines; those patients 
reporting greater feelings of isolation, loneliness, or dis-
connection from others appeared to view their pain as a 
more problematic experience than those with relatively 
lower levels of SI. Notably, as neither PI nor PF was

 found to predict ratings of SI at a later time, our findings 
suggest either a greater degree of stability in feelings of 
SI (that does not track closely with pain-related impair-
ments) or a need for targeted psychosocial interventions 
designed to improve interpersonal functioning and the 
enjoyment and meaningfulness of social interactions.
Similarly, Cheatle et al. [36] have shown that the level 
of social withdrawal had implications beyond PI and PF 
status and was predictive of suicidal ideation for people 
with chronic pain. Although our study did not articulate 
the effects that passive coping strategies (such as pro-
longed patterns of behavioral or social avoidance due to 
pain) may have played in the outcomes of our patients, 
it is feasible that a passive approach to pain may have 
reinforced the high levels of pain-related physical and 
psychosocial problems noted in our sample. Our results, 
and those of other researchers, highlight the importance 
of consideration of the biopsychosocial model [37], not 
only in understanding the prediction and alleviation of 
pain but also in physical and mental health outcomes.
Collectively, these studies are in line with the theory 
that social context significantly affects the processing 
and experience of pain. Eisenberger [38] provides evi-
dence from multiple studies that demonstrate the sim-
ilarities in neurobiological substrates of the painful 
sensations associated with social disconnection and 
physical pain. From a positive psychology perspective, 
our results suggest that having a robust social network 
provides a “pain-buffering” effect. The Institute of 
Medicine Report on Relieving Pain in America [39] high-
lights that pain has significant social consequences, and 
our data complement this model by providing evidence 
of a more intricate relationship in that the degree of SI 
also has an effect on the perception of pain and phys-
ical consequences. A deeper understanding of the pro-
cesses that SI and a person’s environment can have on 
the influence of their health, and adaptation to pain is 
required. Furthermore, the potential influencing factors 
of SI should also be considered. For example, people 
with chronic pain can feel stigmatized by family, friends, 
health professionals, and the general public [40], which 
could contribute toward and further perpetuate SI.
Limitations and Future Directions
Some limitations of performing a longitudinal assess-
ment of prospective observational data and clinical 
setting include reduced control over data collection 
and availability, as well as potential variability in the 
degree of pain interventions received by each patient

 (low internal validity). However, the strengths consist 
of broad inclusion criteria and a diverse environment 
(high external validity). The heterogeneity of a bundled 
treatment delivered within a tertiary referral center does 
not allow for interpretation of which treatment(s) were 
more effective than others, nor could we control for the 
co-occurring effects of pain medication, psychotherapy 
or physical therapy services, or interventional proce-
dures. The survey time points between health care visits 
were not consistent between patients due to the nature 
of the clinical environment, as regular follow-up may not 
have been warranted, available, and/or desired by some 
patients. As a result of these factors, there was a large 
proportion of our patient sample that was unsuitable for 
inclusion in the longitudinal analysis due to a lack of fol-
low-up time points. As our analysis focused on the use of 
data captured at clinic visits and not collected prospec-
tively, our sample may reflect tendencies among a group 
of patients more inclined toward regular follow-ups in a 
tertiary care pain clinic, which may be due to increased 
pain, distress, or to other factors not captured by our 
model. Consequently, more structured prospective lon-
gitudinal studies of these factors appear indicated. 
Moreover, the results from the PSM analysis have to be 
read with caution as the CIA is not entirely fulfilled and 
the attribution to treatment and control groups thus not 
completely random.
In regards to future directions, it would be valuable 
for future studies to examine other potential media-
tors between SI and PI, such as pain self-efficacy, pain 
acceptance, and pain-related fear of movement. From 
a treatment standpoint, amelioration of SI in patients 
with chronic pain could involve motivational interview-
ing and group-based participatory training in mindful-
ness, loving-kindness, and compassion cultivation [41] 
in an effort to increase social engagement. Preliminary 
evidence suggests that a Mindfulness-Based Stress 
Reduction program was effective in reducing loneliness 
in older adults [42]. Furthermore, family hardiness and 
family social support should be a consideration in reduc-
ing the impact of SI, as it has been shown to decrease 
disability in people living with fibromyalgia [43].
Conclusions
The impact of pain is reduced in individuals who per-
ceive a greater sense of inclusion from and engagement 
with others. Our study contributes to the fields of pain 
medicine and rehabilitation science by providing prelim-
inary details on the degree to which an individual’s level 
of social embeddedness may influence the level of their 
physical and mental health. The finding that SI signifi-
cantly affects individuals’ PI, particularly given the lack 
of effects of PI or PF on SI, would suggest that individ-
uals’ level of social connection and engagement should 
be considered in the assessment and treatment plan. This 
study enhances the understanding of how social factors 
affect pain and have implications for how the effective-
ness of therapeutic interventions may be improved.

mographic characteristics observed in the treatment group (high SI) can also be observed among the control group (low SI). This figure 
demonstrates that almost all treatment observations are “on support,” that is, they were matched to control observations. Only 16 treat-
ment observations were excluded from the analysis because it was not possible to match them to control observations (“off support”).

Appendix A
Formal Description of the Propensity Score Method
We estimate the average treatment effect on the treated 
(ATT) that is defined as the difference between expected out-
come values with and without treatment for those who actu-
ally received a treatment [33] It is given by β = E (Y(1)−Y(0) 
| T = 1), whereby Y(0) is the outcome without treatment, 
Y(1) the outcome with treatment, and T the treatment.
