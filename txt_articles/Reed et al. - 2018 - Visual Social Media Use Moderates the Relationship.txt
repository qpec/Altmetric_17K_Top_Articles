Abstract:
Background:
Little is known about the temporal directionality of relationships between problematic internet use and personality disorders such as
narcissism.
Objective:
Although these two constructs are related at a single time, no existent study has determined whether initial problematic internet use is
more strongly associated with subsequent narcissism, or vice versa. So, the aim of the research is to verify if problematic internet use
predicts the narcissism or vice versa.
Methods:
Seventy-four university student participants were studied over a four-month period, and completed the Narcissism Personality
Inventory, and Problematic Internet Use Questionnaire, at baseline and follow-up.
Results:
The results demonstrated a relationship between problematic internet use and narcissism at baseline. Time-lagged correlations
demonstrated that problematic internet use at baseline was positively related to narcissism four-months later, but not vice versa for
social media users whose use was primarily visual. This relationship did not hold for social media users whose use was primarily
verbal.
Conclusion:
These results suggest that problematic internet use may serve to discharge narcissistic personality traits for those who use social
media in a visual way, but not for those who do not engage in that form of internet use.
Keywords: Narcissism, Longitudinal study, Facebook, Instagram, Social media, PIU.
1. INTRODUCTION
It  is  estimated  that  between  6-18%  of  the  younger  population  show  some  degree  of  digital-dependency  or
Problematic Internet Use (PIU) [1, 2]. PIU is manifest in terms of multiple negative impacts on the individual’s life [3],
including the development of  tolerance [4], and withdrawal effects  when disconnected  from the internet  [5, 6].
Socially,  there are  negative impacts  on friendship  and  increased  loneliness  [7]. Heavy  internet use  interferes  with

quantity and quality of sleep [8] and with healthy-eating and exercise [9]. Psychologically, there are increased levels of
depression and anxiety [5, 10], as well as deleterious impacts on attention span [11], memory [12], and impulse control
[13]. PIU is also associated with increased levels of illness [14] and immune function problems [15].
PIU is also associated with a range of clinical problems and personality traits [16, 17], including narcissism [18]
[19]. In extreme forms, narcissism can be a clinical problem reflecting feelings of self-importance, unlimited success,
uniqueness, as well as a lack of empathy, envy, and arrogance [20], but it also exists in subclinical forms in the general
population. It has been suggested that social media can allow narcissistic individuals to express these traits, and to
receive gratification of their needs [18, 21].
Moreover, self-promotion via social media may fuel narcissism, and engagement in visual forms of social media,
such as self-portrait photographs featuring the user may be particularly important in this regard [22]. Indeed, there are
studies that show a relationship between narcissism and the use of such self-portraits [21, 23]. This finding implies that
the use of some forms of social media, particularly those which rely heavily on the use of visual content (  e.g. ,
Facebook, Instagram [24]), may be particularly important in moderating any relationship between PIU and narcissism.
In contrast, it may be that social media usage that is primarily textual (Twitter, Snapchat) may not moderate this
relationship to the same extent.
However, there have been no longitudinal studies of the relationship between PIU and narcissism. Although there is
clear  evidence  of  a  relationship  between  the  two  constructs,  it  is  not  known  whether  those  with  higher  levels  of
narcissism are likely, subsequently, to have higher levels of PIU; or whether those with higher levels of PIU are likely,
subsequently, to have higher levels of narcissism. Consequently, the first aim of the current study was to study the
relationship between these measures over a four-month period, and establish whether initial PIU is a stronger predictor
of later narcissism than initial narcissism is a predictor of later PIU or vice versa.
The second aim of the current study is to explore whether the type of social media usage acts to moderate between
PIU and narcissism, and vice versa, over time.
To these ends, the level of self-reported PIU and narcissism in a group of participants were measured at baseline,
and again after four months. The participants were also asked about their usage of the internet and social media, and the
predominant forms of usage were determined. These data were then analysed to establish the time-lagged relationship
between initial PIU and subsequent narcissism, and between initial narcissism and subsequent PIU. In addition, the
current study explored whether the use of visual or verbal forms of social media moderated any emerging relationships.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Participants
Seventy-four  participants  (19  male  and  55  female)  were  recruited  initially,  and  all  completed  the  study.  All
participants were students from a Psychology Department of a University in the UK, and all were volunteers – none
received any form of compensation. The participants mean age at baseline was 23.09 (SD + 3.42; range = 18 – 34)
years. Younger participants were thought appropriate to target as they are most commonly affected by PIU [3, 25].
Power calculations suggested that for an estimated small effect size f’ = .15, with 80% power, and a significance
criterion of p < .05, a sample size of 67 would be necessary for a regression analysis with one predictor and one
moderator variable.
2.1.1. Design of study
Because of lack of longitudinal studies in the literature, we applied a longitudinal observational study.
2.1.2. Data analysis
For  estimating  the  relationship  between  predictor  variables  and  a  dependent  variable,  we  applied  a  multiple
regression. Because our study is longitudinal, we used a time-lagged correlation. This correlation extends linear Pearson
correlation by determining the best correlations among variables shifted in time.

2.2.1. Narcissism Personality Inventory
(NPI-40 [26]) is 40-item inventory measuring the extent of a narcissistic personality. The total scale gives a score
from 0 to 40. The baseline internal reliability (Cronbach α) was .792, and α at follow-up was .814.
2.2.2. Problematic Internet Use Questionnaire
(PIUQ  [27])  is  an  18-item  questionnaire  designed  to  measure  the  degree  to  which  internet  use  disrupts  an
individual’s life. The total scale gives a score between 0 and 56. There are three sub-scales that measure obsession,
neglect, and control disorder. The baseline internal reliability (Cronbach α) was .865, and α at follow-up was .901.
2.2.3. Demographics and Internet Use
Participants were asked about their age and gender. They were also asked to estimate their average hours of internet
usage per day for personal reasons (excluding work), over the last few weeks. Personal use has been shown to correlate
more strongly with PIU than a combined measure of personal and work use [14]. Participants also were asked to list the
specific websites, apps, or platforms that they used, in order of frequency of usage.
2.3. Procedure
Participants were sent an online survey via email, which they completed online with the data saving automatically to
an EXCEL file. Four months after they completed the initial baseline survey, they were sent the survey again via e-mail,
and they completed and returned it in the same way. All surveys were completed and returned within one week of their
being sent to the participant. Participants compiled NPI-40 and PIUQ, and provided demographic and Internet use data.
3. RESULTS
The sample-mean personal use was 4.92 (+ 1.60; range = 1 – 7) days per week (work usage was excluded as it does
not predict PIU as strongly [14]). The sample-mean personal usage per day was 2.92 (+ 1.83; Range = 1 – 8) hours.
In terms of the reasons for internet usage: 74 participants (98%) cited social networking, 70 (93%) research, 64
(85%) shopping/banking, 61 (81%) news and information, 61 (81%) entertainment, 46 (61%) content sharing, 17 (23%)
gaming,  12  (16%)  sexual  content,  8  (11%)  dating,  7  (9%)  traditional  blogging,  4  (5%)  chat  rooms,  and  3  (4%)
gambling.
Of the social media usage, 44 (59%) participants cited Facebook in the top three platforms and websites that they
used, 17 (23%) participants mentioned Instagram, 10 (13%) Twitter, and 10 (13%) Snapchat. Broadly classifying these
usages as visual (Facebook and Instagram) revealed that 50 (67%) used visual forms of social media, and 16 (21%)
used social media in a primarily verbal way.
Table 1 shows the baseline and follow-up means for narcissism (NPI), problematic internet use (PIUQ), and hours a
day personal use for the sample, as well as the Pearson correlations between the variables.

To test the hypothesis that narcissism at follow-up is a function of baseline problematic internet use, and whether
being a visual user moderates this relationship, a multiple regression was conducted. In the first step, baseline PIU and
visual use were entered. These variables did not account for a significant amount of variance in follow-up narcissism, R
2
= .251, F(2,70) = 2.11, p = .106. To avoid potentially problematic high multicollinearity with the interaction term, the
variables were centred, and an interaction term between baseline PIU and visual use was created [28]. The interaction
term between PIU and visual use was added to the regression model, which accounted for a significant proportion of the
variance in narcissism, ΔR
2 = .055, ΔF(1,70) = 5.99, p < .01, b = .225, t(70) = 2.45, p < .01. Examination of the
interaction plot (top left panel Fig. 1) showed that as baseline problematic internet use increased, follow-up narcissism
increased for visual users, but reduced for non-visual users.

account for a significant amount of variance in follow-up PIU, R

4. DISCUSSION
The  current  study  noted  that  initial  levels  of  Problematic  Internet  Use  (PIU)  predicted  subsequent  levels  of
Narcissism (NPI), but only for those who used primarily visual forms of social media. This relationship was not seen for
those who reported that they used social media in primarily verbal ways. There was also a smaller relationship between
levels of narcissism at baseline and subsequent levels of problematic internet use, but these were not as strong as the
above temporal relationship.
The current study also noted that this relationship was moderated by the nature of social media usage. Social media
usage was virtually universal in the current sample, but the form in which they primarily used social media differed.
The majority of the sample used primarily visual forms of social media – those involving sending images. Those who
used the social media in this manner were more likely to show the relationship between initial levels of PIU and
subsequent levels of narcissism, noted above, than those who tended to employ social media in verbal forms.
The reasons for the association between initial levels of PIU and subsequent levels of narcissism will need to be
explored further. However, one suggestion that has some degree of face validity, in relation to previous evidence, is that
PIU may impact and reinforce the self-esteem of individuals with high levels of narcissistic traits [19]. The use of visual
forms of social media, such as Facebook and Instragram, may help to emphasize and facilitate the perception of such
individuals that they are the focus of attention, and to satisfy their needs to be admired [18]. Contacting the world
through a visual modality in a virtual arena, without the possibility of immediate ‘direct’ social censure, may offer the
opportunity to discharge (or inflict) some aspects of narcissistic personality [29]. This provides the individual with
opportunities to present themselves in a grandiose manner, and to realize their fantasies of omnipotence [18, 29]. Of
course, there are a number of limitations to the current study.
Internet use and social media usage was assessed through self-report, and not objective means, and the classification
of social media usage into primarily visual or verbal on the basis of the type of social media platform preferred may not
be  as  fine-grained  as  it  could  be.  However,  that  the  effect  emerged,  suggests  that  these  results  warrant  further
investigation. It may also be useful to explore the particular components of narcissism ( e.g. , vanity, exploitativeness,
etc.) that are most impacted by internet usage. This was not attempted in the current study due to the sample size. The
analysis of the components of narcissism could be the goal of future research.
Another limitation is about the external validity of the findings that can be problematic as we used a convenience
sample of students. In future research, a random sampling from the general population could be used.
A third limitation concerns the fact that the four months time lag may bring in some confounding factors. However,
in a longitudinal study, the time interval must be long enough to detect the change in status. Probably four months is
enough time to detect changes in time and not so large as to greatly increase the risk of confounding events. Also, it is
 168   The Open Psychology Journal , 2018, Volume 11
Reed et al.
true that the regression models look at the relationship between key variables, but one can evaluate whether variables
predicts another.
Furthermore,  it  should  be  noted  that  our  study  had  a  participation  rate  equal  to  100%  of  the  initial  sample,
overcoming one of the general risks of longitudinal studies.
On the other hand, the results of the study are in accordance with previous findings on Internet use and narcissism
[21].
CONCLUSION
This is the first study to examine the longitudinal relationship between levels of problematic internet use and
narcissism, and suggests that, although there may be a bidirectional relationship over time, PIU appears to drive levels
of narcissism. This has been suggested in previous cross-sectional studies, an effect also noted in the current study, but
which has not been demonstrated over time [18, 21].
Furthermore, the relationship between initial levels of PIU and subsequent levels of narcissism moderated by the
mainly visual use of social media has been predicted, but not demonstrated, previously [21, 23].
The current study demonstrated that problematic internet use does predict subsequent levels of narcissism and that
this was moderated by visual forms of social media engagement. So our study confirms the hypothesis that problematic
internet use may serve to release narcissistic personality traits for those who use social media in a visual way only.
These  findings  suggest  further  reasons  to  be  concerned  over  the  psychological  impacts  of  digital  technology,
especially for younger users.
The results of the study can be used for preventive actions. As it is known that NPI scores increased as the self-
esteem  decreased,  educational  interventions  for  younger  users  can  be  planned  by  improving  self-esteem  levels,
especially related to self-image with guided exercises, and increasing awareness of the risks of sharing self-images on
social networks, posted only with the aim of appearing. The intervention could be useful to prevent a pathological
narcissistic regulation, maybe more when the predominant features are the organization of the sense of self around the
adolescent's beauty, coupled with an ongoing need for admiration from others.
From a clinical point of view, the psychologist should evaluate, in addition to the levels of Internet addiction and the
use of social networks in a visual way, also the levels of narcissism, and the subjective historical relation between
problematic use of the Internet and narcissism. If this is the case, the psychologist may apply psychotherapy to deal with
Internet addiction and dysfunctional personality trait.
