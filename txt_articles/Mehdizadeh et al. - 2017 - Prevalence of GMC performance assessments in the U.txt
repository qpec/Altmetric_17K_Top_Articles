Prevalence of GMC performance
assessments in the United Kingdom: a
retrospective cohort analysis by country of
medical qualification

Abstract
Background: The demographics of doctors working in the UK are changing. The United Kingdom (UK) has voted
to leave the European Union (EU) and there is heightened political discourse around the world about the impact of
migration on healthcare services. Previous work suggests that foreign trained doctors perform worse than UK
graduates in postgraduate medical examinations. We analysed the prevalence by country of primary medical
qualification of doctors who were required to take an assessment by the General Medical Council (GMC) because of
performance concerns.
Methods: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of data routinely collected by the GMC. We compared doctors
who had a GMC performance assessment between 1996 and 2013 with the medical register in the same period.
The outcome measures were numbers experiencing performance assessments by country or region of medical
qualification.
Results: The rate of performance assessment varied significantly by place of medical qualification and by year;
χ2(17) = 188, p < 0.0001, pseudo-R2 = 15%. Doctors who trained outside of the UK, including those trained in the
European Economic Area (EEA), were more likely to have a performance assessment than UK trained doctors, with
the exception of South African trained doctors.
Conclusions: The rate of performance assessment varies significantly by place of medical qualification. This is the
first study to explore the risk of performance assessment by individual places of medical qualification. While
concern has largely focused on the competence of non-EEA, International Medical Graduates, we discuss
implications for how to ensure European trained doctors are fit to practise before their medical licence in the UK is
granted. Further research is needed to investigate whether these country effects hold true when controlling for
factors like doctors’ sex, age, length of time working in the UK, and English language skills. This will allow evidence-
based decisions to be made around the regulatory environment the UK should adopt once it leaves the EU.
Patients should be reassured that the vast majority of all doctors working in the UK are competent.

 Background
The demographics of United Kingdom (UK) doctors has
been changing in recent years and may change further
following a referendum decision to leave the European
Union (EU) [1]. We are in a period of heightened polit-
ical discourse about immigration and supranational
trade agreements across the developed world, with many
implications for health services. The migration of doc-
tors from low and middle income countries to high in-
come countries in North America and Western Europe
is well documented [2–4]. Political rhetoric has raised
concerns for immigrant doctors in, for example, the
United States [5–7]. With developed countries often
dependent
on
healthcare
professionals
who
trained
abroad [8], the question of how to assess qualifications
from another country is significant. Healthcare services
need to ensure that staff are competent and that mecha-
nisms to ensure this are transparent to the public. At
present, in the UK, doctors who qualified in the rest of
the EU, the wider European Economic Area (EEA) or in
former EEA member Switzerland can practise without
further assessment of their clinical skills. As shorthand,
we refer to these below as EEA doctors. Those trained
elsewhere must pass the Professional and Linguistic As-
sessments Board (PLAB) test before practising: we refer
to these non-EEA, international medical graduates as
IMGs. See Table 1 for a summary. The regulatory con-
text in the future is as yet unknown [9, 10].
There has been a dramatic change in the pattern of
non-UK trained doctors joining the medical register in
recent years. A higher proportion of graduates from the
EEA, particularly Spain and Greece, joined the medical
register compared to IMGs [5]. Historically, the propor-
tion of doctors in the UK who were IMGs was always
higher than EEA doctors. While EEA doctors only repre-
sented a tenth of the total medical population in 2013,
their proportional increase is likely to be due to the eco-
nomic downturn in southern Europe and the expansion
of the EEA [6]. Similar trends have been noted else-
where, including Germany [11] and Ireland [2]. Mean-
while, changes to the UK’s immigration policy in 2010
made it more difficult for IMGs to get an employment
visa, perhaps explaining the decrease in the proportion
joining the register [12].
The General Medical Council (GMC) are the UK’s
medical regulatory body responsible for protecting, pro-
moting and maintaining the health and safety of the
public. As part of this role, the GMC can investigate the
fitness to practise of doctors working in the UK about
which they receive complaints to ensure proper stan-
dards in medical practice are upheld. Where the con-
cerns relate to an aspect of the doctor’s performance
(such as a basic lack of knowledge, poor clinical judge-
ment, inappropriate prescribing, tendency to use out-
dated techniques or poor record keeping), they may be
required to take a performance assessment. A perform-
ance assessment may form one part of a wider investiga-
tion into a doctor’s fitness to practise.
The GMC holds data on all doctors who have under-
gone performance assessment as part of a Fitness to
Practise investigation. Doctors under performance as-
sessment usually undergo a peer review and test of com-
petence [13, 14]. The test of competence is used to
identify potential gaps in a doctor’s knowledge base and/
or their clinical skills. This includes a written knowledge
test using Single Best Answer format and an Objective
Structured Clinical Examination closely tailored to the
doctor’s grade, speciality and clinical work. The marks
achieved by the doctor under investigation are compared
to the range of marks achieved by a comparison group
of doctors who have volunteered to take a similar test in
the same specialty [15]. Trained investigators at the

 GMC use all of the above aspects of a performance as-
sessment to reach a judgement about a doctor’s fitness
to practise. These data are collated from the LRMP and
portfolios of each doctor that contains their personal in-
formation, qualifications and details around their em-
ployment history and clinical work.
While the UK relies on foreign trained doctors to fill
shortages in the health service [8], their clinical perform-
ance has been the subject of concern in recent years, ar-
guably unfairly [16]. Poorer performance of IMGs in
postgraduate examinations in the UK has been reported
in numerous studies when compared to UK graduates
[17, 18]. We also know that IMGs are more likely to be
complained about to the GMC and receive more severe
disciplinary action than other doctors in Fitness to Prac-
tise investigations [19, 20]. However concern has also
grown around the performance of European trained doc-
tors [20, 21]. This has been highlighted by high profile
cases such as the German-trained doctor who killed a
patient during his first locum shift in the UK, and a
Bosnian-trained obstetrician who caused the death of a
new-born baby [22]. Evidence shows these are not iso-
lated incidents. One study analysed results on part one
of the Royal College of Anaesthetists examination and
produced a list of countries of primary medical qualifica-
tion (PMQ) that performed worse than UK graduates.
While graduates from Egypt, Iraq and Pakistan per-
formed worse, so did graduates from certain European
countries [23]. GMC statistics also report that men who
graduated from a European medical school are at greater
risk of being complained about to and/or disciplined by
the GMC [19]. In GMC Fitness to Practise hearings be-
tween 2009 and 2012, higher proportions of EEA doc-
tors were found to be impaired in their performance
compared to IMGs and UK graduates [24–27]. Further,
an earlier study that analysed erasures and suspensions
from
the
List
of
Registered
Medical
Practitioners
(LRMP) by country of medical qualification, found that
European countries made up half of the top 20 countries
that were more likely than the UK to have their gradu-
ates be erased or suspended by the GMC [28].
We note that this contrasts with the situation in the
US where a recent study found that patients treated by
international graduates had lower mortality than patients
cared for by US graduates [29] and international gradu-
ates perform better in some exams [30].
Aim and purpose of study
Given the recent and likely forthcoming changes to the
UK’s medical register and the increasing concern around
the performance of non-UK medical graduates, we com-
pared the demographics of the UK’s medical register
with doctors who had undertaken a performance assess-
ment with the GMC to determine whether country of
training predicts performance assessments and, if so,
whether this might be explained by other factors. We fo-
cussed on the prevalence of GMC performance assess-
ments by country of PMQ. Data made available by the
GMC allowed us to control for some additional factors
and examine performance in more detail than previous
studies.
Methods
This was a retrospective cohort analysis of data routinely
collected by the GMC.
We compared two sets of data:
1) a cohort of doctors who had a performance
assessment between 1996 and 2013.
2) the medical register (LRMP) between 1996 and
2014.
Performance assessment data was only available up to
2013, but LRMP data was additionally available for 2014.
The cohorts were compared according to: sex, country
and year of primary medical qualification, specialty and
age.
Variables
The data on sex was complete for both cohorts. In order
to plot trends over time, we analysed the year the GMC
received an enquiry about each doctor; this date marked
the start of their performance investigation. There were
29 cases for which the enquiry year was missing. We
also analysed the medical register at each year end.
Data was available for the country and year doctors
gained their PMQ from. Data was also recorded on spe-
cialty and age band.
We did not have data on the outcome for those under
performance investigation. Investigations take some time
to complete and many were not complete at the time of
data collection. From other GMC data, we know that
among individuals who complete tests of competence,
over half receive some kind of sanction, with roughly
equal numbers being cleared without sanction or volun-
tarily withdrawing from the register [31].
Data analysis
We analysed the demographics of the two cohorts by
comparing frequency data. We focused our analysis on
doctors’ PMQ country, initially in the context of changes
to the medical register over time. We then compared
the rates of performance assessments over time by PMQ
country using negative binomial regression. This allows
us to consider country differences while adjusting for
the significant changes in the rate of assessments over
time.

 Results
Comparing performance assessment cases with medical
register
We compared the population of doctors under perform-
ance assessment with doctors who were on the medical
register. We show descriptive statistics in order to pro-
vide due context for the analysis by country of training.
Results for the earliest (1996) and latest (2014) years in
the data are shown in Table 1. Men and black minority
ethnic doctors were over represented as compared to
the medical register. More than 80% of doctors under
performance assessment were above 40 years old, as
compared to the medical register where a large propor-
tion of doctors are under 40. A significantly higher num-
ber
of
surgeons
and
general
practitioners
had
a
performance assessment as compared to the proportion
listed on the medical register as of 2014 (Table 2).
Comparing PMQ between performance assessment cases
and medical register
Doctors on the medical register in 2014, the most recent
year of the data, received their PMQ from 149 different
states or territories. Doctors under performance assess-
ment from1996 to 2013 qualified from 58 states or terri-
tories. Table 3 shows the 25 countries with the most
performance assessments. Doctors on the medical regis-
ter in 2014 most frequently graduated from the UK,
India and Pakistan. The highest number of performance
assessments was also conducted on UK, Indian and
Pakistan graduates (Table 3).
Changes to the medical register over time
It was necessary to place the performance assessment
data in the context of changes that have happened to the
medical register between 1996 and 2013. The rate of as-
sessments depends on a denominator, the number of
doctors trained in different countries, that has been
changing rapidly. We summarise these
changes in
Table 4 and compared them to the proportion of per-
formance assessments that have been conducted on doc-
tors qualifying in the same regions. This gave us a sense
of which places of qualification are over and underrepre-
sented in the GMC’s performance assessments when
compared to the medical register. Based on the data
available, we decided to analyse the data for the follow-
ing 16 countries and categories:
I). the UK
II). the ten countries with the highest numbers of
registered doctors in 2014
III).the ten countries with highest number of
performance assessments (which adds Bangladesh,
Iraq and Sri Lanka in addition to the above)
IV).European Union (EU) 2004 accession states as a
block, i.e. countries that joined the EU in 2004,
namely Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary,
Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and
Slovenia
V). a combined category for all other current EEA
states not otherwise covered plus Switzerland (i.e.,
countries excluded from the Professional and
Linguistics Assessment Board examination)
VI).rest of the world (ROW)
Small numbers prevented us from considering other
countries in detail.
The total number of UK trained doctors has in-
creased on the medical register by 31% since 1996
(from 125,486 to 164,691, Table 4). For other coun-
tries, the largest absolute increase is Indian-trained
doctors, up 12,361(97%), with the largest fall being
Australian-trained, down to 2868 (from 4834 in 1996

 to 1955 in 2014). The largest number of performance
assessments was conducted on UK graduates (332),
but the proportion of assessment cases on UK gradu-
ates is less than half that of the proportion on the
medical register in 2013. UK graduates are underrep-
resented in performance assessments.
We plotted trends over time and, as illustrative exam-
ples, show the results for doctors qualified in the UK,
Bangladesh, Germany, Greece, Nigeria and the EU 2004
states. The pattern of UK and Bangladesh trained doc-
tors was similar: a steady increase in doctors joining the
register until a sharp decrease between 2008 and 2009
(Figs.
1
and
2).
Whereas
doctors
that
trained
in
Germany, Greece, Nigeria and the EU 2004 states dif-
fered dramatically from one another in their patterns of
joining the medical register (Figs. 3, 4, 5 and 6). In par-
ticular, the effects of the economic crisis are evident in
the recent sharp increase in Greek trained doctors join-
ing the UK medical register (Fig. 5).
Comparing rates of performance assessments by PMQ
We calculated the rate of performance assessments per
thousand doctors, per enquiry year. Table 5 shows an
inverted-U shape across time. The highest rate of per-
formance assessments was conducted on doctors who
trained in Bangladesh in 2001 and 2002 (roughly 4.5
cases per thousand per year). Doctors who trained in the
UK and South Africa showed consistently low rates of
performance
assessments
across
the
time
period
(Table 5).
After some exploratory analyses, we performed a nega-
tive binomial regression on the number of assessments
and number of doctors on the register in each year by
PMQ country. The data were over-dispersed compared

 to a Poisson regression, so a negative binomial regres-
sion was used. We included independent variables to
cover: (1) year (modelled as a quadratic function), and
(2) place of medical qualification. This allows us to con-
trol for changes over time in assessment rates and the
make-up of the medical register. The model was highly
significant:
χ2(17) = 188,
p < 0.0001,
pseudo-R2 = 15%.
The rate of performance assessment varies significantly
by where a doctor qualified and by enquiry year.
We calculated an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of per-
formance assessment for PMQ country, with UK gradu-
ates
as
the
baseline,
controlling
for
enquiry
year
(Table 5). An IRR can be interpreted similarly to an odds
ratio: 1 represents no difference with UK graduates. All
doctors who trained outside the UK were more likely to
have a performance assessment, with the exception of
South African-trained doctors. Doctors who trained in
Bangladesh were 13 times more likely to have a perform-
ance
assessment
than
UK
graduates,
followed
by
Egyptian and Nigerian trained doctors with an IRR of 8.
Doctors who trained in the EU accession states and the
remainder of EEA were more than 4 times likelier to
have a performance assessment than UK graduates. We
plot these incidence rate ratios with confidence intervals
in Fig. 7. An important caveat to note is that these IRRs
represent very small actual numbers of doctors given the
low baseline rate.

 We also did pairwise comparisons to test whether the
differences in IRRs between PMQ regions were significant
or not (Table 6). The rate of performance assessments
conducted on UK trained doctors is significantly lower
compared to doctors who qualified outside of the UK with
the exception of South African-trained doctors (Table 6).
Analysis of the medical register
The GMC provided a list of all doctors who had been
on the register at any time between 1996 and 2014 with
sex, country of PMQ and year of PMQ. This covers
440,505 individuals. We analysed this data to identify
possible confounders to our main analysis.
Using the same country coding as the previous ana-
lysis, we investigated whether PMQ region varies by
these other variables. There is a significant difference by
PMQ region and gender: χ2(15) = 7425, p < 0.001. Every
non-UK region has more male doctors, ranging from
86.4% for Egypt to 58.2% for the EEA remainder cat-
egory, compared to 56.6% for the UK.
If we compare PMQ country by being on the GP regis-
ter, there is a significant difference: χ2(15) = 22,584, p <
0.001. Every non-UK region has fewer doctors on the
GP register, ranging from 1.2% for Greece to 18.2% for
Bangladesh and Nigeria, compared to 25.6% for the UK.

was statistically significant: χ2 (15) = 18,059, p < 0.001. This
means that on average, the year that doctors qualified var-
ied by where they graduated from. For example, Irish grad-
uates on average (median) qualified the earliest, in 1981,
whereas UK graduates on average qualified in 1992. Italian
trained doctors qualified the latest, 1999 on average.
Discussion
Summary of main results
The rate of performance assessment varies significantly
by enquiry year and where a doctor qualified. Control-
ling for year, doctors who trained outside the UK were
more likely to have a performance assessment, with the

 exception of South African trained doctors. Doctors who
trained in Bangladesh were 13 times more likely to have
a performance assessment than UK graduates, followed
by Nigerian and Egyptian trained doctors who were 8
times more likely. German trained doctors were over
represented among EEA graduates. Doctors who trained
in the 2004 EU accession states and the bulk of the EEA
were over 4 times more likely to have a performance as-
sessment than UK graduates.
Findings in relation to other studies
Our findings indicate that the prevalence of GMC per-
formance assessments differs depending on a doctor’s
country of qualification. Further, our data supports that
of other studies that highlight doctors who trained in
certain countries within and outside of the EEA perform
worse than UK graduates. South African trained doctors,
like UK graduates, have been found to perform better
than average on part one of the Royal College of

examination,
while
graduates
from
Greece, Germany and Ireland performed significantly
worse [23], matching our results on performance assess-
ments from these countries. Our results also concord
with an earlier analysis of the LRMP [28]. While previ-
ous evidence has focused on comparing how UK gradu-
ates and IMGs compare in the Fitness to Practise
process [20], this is the first study since Wakeford’s in
2011 [28] that has explored the process on a country by
country basis and the first that has been able to control
for changes over time.
Perhaps one explanation is in differences in the way
doctors are trained in different countries. Training in
the UK has long been integrating patient contact and
practical skills into early undergraduate training [32].
German medical schools have only adopted this ap-
proach more recently [33]. Questionnaire studies have
also reported major differences in medical regulation
among non-UK countries. One study found that in cer-
tain countries (Spain, Austria, Finland and Estonia) there
was an implicit expectation that doctors maintain com-
petence without needing to comply with formal stan-
dards. Whereas in others (Belgium, Germany, Hungary,
the Netherlands, Slovenia and the UK), an explicit dem-
onstration of continued competence is mandatory [34].
Further, when representatives from 14 EU countries
were surveyed, authors concluded that the systems of li-
censing and registration vary so much that it creates
confusion and problems in the context of the free move-
ment of doctors. In particular, there were large differ-
ences in how fitness to practise is conceptualised and
some countries showed weaknesses in their systems that
should identify doctors who are unfit to practise [35]. As
well as IMGs, European graduates are more likely to ex-
perience difficulty in adapting to a very different health-
care context than the one in which they trained [21].
Another unanswered question is how representative
doctors who choose to move to the UK are compared to
doctors who stay practicing in the country in which they
trained.
There is also a question around who gets complained
about to the GMC [16]. Non-UK trained graduates, in-
cluding those from the EEA as well as minority ethnic
doctors, are more vulnerable to being complained about
than white UK graduates [36]. It is possible that an over
representation of non-UK trained doctors is due to
prejudice. Unconscious bias against foreign-born doctors
has been shown experimentally among students [37] and
staff from ethnic minority backgrounds working in the
NHS are more likely to report harassment and discrim-
ination from their patients and colleagues [38]. Similar
issues with discrimination by patients and colleagues
were seen in a US survey of Muslim doctors [5].
Meaning of the study
Rates of performance assessments differ depending on
the country or region a doctor trained in. However,
without further investigation, it is unclear as to whether
this represents a true difference in doctors’ competence.
Rates of performance assessments overall are very low
and absolute differences between countries are tiny.
Problems leading to an investigation may not reflect
poor medical competence, but be due to poorer English
language skills or lack of knowledge of the UK’s health

 service. Performance investigation is not a reflection of
poor performance alone but also of complaints patterns,
which could indicate prejudice in the system.
Our findings suggest concern not only with IMGs but
also European-trained doctors given that they were signifi-
cantly more likely to have a GMC performance assess-
ment than doctors trained in the UK, South Africa and
our “rest of the world” category. One qualitative study
found that European trained doctors reported similar diffi-
culties to IMGs when adapting to practising medicine in
the UK’s healthcare setting and medical regulatory system
[39]. European law has prevented the selective testing of
doctors trained in an EEA country that is different to how
UK trained doctors are tested. There is currently no
mandatory assessment process to check the competence
of EEA medical graduates before their UK medical licence
is granted, although we note that EEA graduates who have
not done the PLAB broadly did no worse than IMGs who
have done the PLAB. The GMC is going to introduce a
medical licensing assessment that will be mandatory for
UK graduates and IMGs prior to their registration. It was
unlikely that the elements of this planned assessment
could have been enforced on European graduates given
European laws around free movement [19, 40]. Currently,
the GMC can only seek evidence of sufficient English
language skills in European graduates and can refuse to
grant a licence to practise where this is not provided [41].
All this may change in a post-Brexit regulatory environ-
ment that is yet to be determined. Further analysis of this
topic is needed rapidly to inform decision making.
We also note that not all overseas trained doctors
were more likely to have a performance assessment.
South African trained doctors were no more likely to
have a performance assessment than UK trained doctors.
While there were too few Hong Kong trained doctors to
include separately in the main analysis—their numbers
have decreased from 2730 to 614 between 1996 and
2013—we note none had a performance assessment.
Therefore it is a matter of further investigation as to
why doctors from certain countries or regions might be
more at risk than others of being investigated by the
GMC due to performance concerns.
Strengths and weaknesses of the study
This is the first study to explore whether place of medical
qualification on a country by country basis affects the like-
lihood of having a GMC performance assessment. We
urge caution in the interpretation of our findings. It is not
true that all doctors who qualified outside the UK are
more likely to have a GMC performance assessment and
those doctors who have an investigation for performance
concerns represent a tiny minority of overseas trained
doctors. While the incidence rate ratios appear large for
some PMQ countries, the number of doctors investigated
for each PMQ country is low and absolute differences be-
tween countries are tiny. The results are further compli-
cated because a performance investigation is not a
reflection of poor performance alone but also of who gets
complained about and how severe the complaint is. A pro-
portion of doctors under performance investigation are
found to be fit to practise. It is also likely that some doc-
tors may show performance concerns but that they are be-
ing managed locally and do not meet the GMC’s
threshold for an investigation. To unpack these factors re-
quires data that we did not have on referral patterns by
PMQ country or final outcome of the investigation.
We know that doctors’ sex [42] and age [43] affect per-
formance and those factors vary by where a doctor
trained in our analysis of the register data. We also know
that complaints vary by specialty, which also varies by
where a doctor trained. We have not been able to adjust
for these confounders. Therefore differences between
PMQ countries may be explainable in terms of the doc-
tors who trained in a particular country having a differ-
ent profile in terms of sex, age and specialty.
Conclusions
From 1996 to 2013, doctors that trained outside of the
UK, including EEA countries, had significantly higher
rates of GMC performance assessments than UK-trained
doctors. The reasons for this are unclear without further
investigation. Poor performance can manifest itself in
many forms some of which include poor clinical know-
ledge, English language skills and a misunderstanding of
patient’s culture or the UK’s healthcare settings. Factors
such as sex, age and specialty of doctors are likely to be
confounding variables. If differences persisted after con-
trolling for these factors, it could reflect true differences in
competency, standards of medical training and/or certifi-
cation between different countries, or it could reflect dif-
ferent treatment of this group by society and employers
[16]. Whether differences by country of training reflect
differences in the ability of some doctors, or biases in sys-
tems of performance evaluation, this is an important
phenomenon that further research needs to explain.
There may be implications for transnational agreements
on freedom of movement of healthcare professionals, and
for what testing is required by national governments of in-
dividuals trained elsewhere. With the UK having to nego-
tiate new arrangements after exiting the EU, such
questions have become more urgent. Research in the UK
can also inform the situation in other countries facing
similar political, economic and social pressures. In the
meantime, patients should be reassured that the vast ma-
jority of doctors working in the UK, irrespective of where
they trained, are competent, and indeed highly skilled.
Further, the NHS could not function without foreign-
trained doctors or other healthcare professionals.
