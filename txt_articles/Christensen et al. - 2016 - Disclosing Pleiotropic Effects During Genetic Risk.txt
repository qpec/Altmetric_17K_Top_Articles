Abstract
Background—Increasing use of genetic testing raises questions about disclosing secondary 
findings, including pleiotropic information.
Objective—To determine the safety and behavioral impact of disclosing modest associations 
between APOE genotype and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk during APOE-based genetic risk 
assessments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Design—Randomized, multicenter equivalence clinical trial
Setting—Four teaching hospitals
Participants—257 asymptomatic adults enrolled, 69% with one AD-affected first degree relative
Intervention—Disclosing AD and CAD genetic risk information (AD+CAD) versus disclosing 
only AD genetic risk (AD-only)
Measurements—Co-primary outcomes were Beck Anxiety Index (BAI) and Center for 
Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) scores at 12 months. Secondary outcomes 
included test-related distress at 12 months, all measures at 6 weeks and 6 months, and health 
behavior changes at 12 months.
Results—12 months after disclosure, mean BAI scores were 3.5 and 3.5 in AD-only and AD
+CAD arms (Δ=0.0, 95%CI: −1.0 to 1.0), and mean CES-D scores were 6.4 and 7.1 in AD-only 
and AD+CAD arms (Δ=0.7, 95%CI: −1.0 to 2.4). Both confidence bounds fell within the 
equivalence margin of +/−5 points. Among ε4-positive participants, distress was lower in AD
+CAD arms than AD-only arms (Δ=−4.8, 95%CI: −8.6 to −1.0) (p=0.031 for disclosure arm x 
APOE genotype). AD+CAD participants also reported more health behavior changes, regardless 
of APOE genotype.
Limitations—Outcomes were self-reported from volunteers without severe anxiety, severe 
depression, or cognitive problems. Analyses omitted 33 randomized participants.

 Conclusion—Disclosing pleiotropic information did not increase anxiety or depression, and may 
have decreased distress among those at increased risk for two conditions. Providing risk 
modification information regarding CAD improved health behaviors. Findings highlight potential 
benefits of secondary genetic findings disclosure when options exist for decreasing risk.

INTRODUCTION
Physicians of all specialties are increasingly using genomic tools, including whole genome 
and whole exome sequencing (1–3) and genotyping for risk variants and pharmacogenomics 
variants (4, 5). These tools often identify incidental or secondary findings that have 
important implications for disease, but are unrelated to the original purposes of testing. 
While recommendations exist for the management of secondary findings in genome 
sequencing (6, 7), this topic remains controversial (8–10). In particular, experts are 
concerned that disclosing such information to patients may increase psychological risks 
while providing minimal clinical benefits (11–15). Despite these concerns, few studies have 
empirically examined the benefits and harms of secondary genomic findings disclosure.
Pleiotropy, the association between genetic variants and multiple disease traits, provides a 
useful model for examining this issue. It is estimated that 17% of genes have pleiotropic 
effects (16). Pleiotropy poses challenges to communicating genetic test results, because 
disclosing a genetic variant associated with one disease may unexpectedly confer knowledge 
of a separate disease risk (17–19). The ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, 
present in over 20% of most populations (20), is robustly associated with the risk of 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (21) and has a weaker, and less well known association with the 
risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) (22, 23). We previously conducted two randomized 
trials of APOE genotype disclosure during AD risk assessment, showing that such disclosure 
did not increase psychological risks to volunteer populations (24, 25) while motivating at-
risk participants to change potential AD risk-reducing behaviors (26, 27). Neither trial 
addressed APOE-CAD associations.
Here, we describe an independent trial wherein we randomized participants seeking a 
genetic risk assessment for AD to receive a) only AD risk information or b) risk information 
for AD and CAD. We hypothesized that both groups would show equivalent levels of 
anxiety and depression one year after disclosure. We also conducted secondary analyses 
examining test-related distress and health behaviors.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Design Overview
The multidisciplinary REVEAL Study group designed the study and risk disclosure 
procedures (24, 25, 28, 29), including ethnicity-specific risk estimates (30, 31). An 
independent Ethics and Safety Board (ESB) and institutional review boards at each study

 site approved the protocol. Participants provided informed consent for initial steps during 
study enrollment, then again prior to the blood draw for genotyping. APOE was genotyped 
at a CLIA-certified facility.
Figure 1 shows the study’s design and flow. After a phone interview and written 
questionnaire, participants received brochures that summarized known benefits, risks, and 
limitations of APOE testing, including potential difficulties coping with test results and the 
lack of “proven ways to prevent Alzheimer’s disease” (24, 29) (Appendix Figure 1). They 
then met with genetic counselors (GCs) who answered individual questions and had blood 
drawn for genotyping. Approximately one month after the blood draw, participants received 
scripted genetic risk information either in-person or by phone, depending on randomization, 
from one of seven GCs who also addressed any participant concerns. Participants were then 
followed for one year, with measurements at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months.
Setting and Participants
We recruited cognitively normal adults from Boston, Cleveland, Washington, DC, and Ann 
Arbor using mailings to research registries, referrals from neurologists, and advertisements 
in local newspapers. To achieve greater sample diversity, we enrolled equal numbers of 
adults over and under age 60 years, and equal numbers of men and women. We also tried to 
enroll 75% of participants with a single AD-affected first degree relative (FDR), and 25% 
with no family history. We excluded individuals with two or more AD-affected FDRs; 
family members with average AD onset under age 60; scores below an education-adjusted 
87 on the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (32); or severe anxiety and depression, 
as defined in the Outcomes and Follow-Up section.
Randomization and Intervention
The primary goals of the trial focused upon the impact of pleiotropic disclosure, but the 
opportunity to address a key question regarding service delivery led to the addition of a 
second randomization to compare telephone and in-person disclosure of genotyping results. 
The telephone vs in-person disclosure results will be reported in a separate manuscript. 
Participants were randomized equally within strata, in blocks of size four, into “AD-only, in-
person disclosure,” “AD-only, telephone disclosure,” “AD+CAD, in-person disclosure,” and 
“AD+CAD, telephone disclosure” arms. Randomization strata were defined by site, age 
(<60 vs ≥60), family history of AD, and gender. Serially-numbered envelopes concealed 
participants’ randomization status until needed. Prior to randomization, participants were 
only informed that they would receive “different types of genetic risk information.” 
Participants in AD-only arms were not informed about APOE-CAD associations. 
Participants in AD+CAD arms were told during a second consent step that they would 
receive information about CAD. Participants learned whether they would receive results in-
person or via telephone during their blood draw appointment.
During genetic risk disclosure, all participants received scripted information about their 
APOE genotype, cumulative lifetime risk (range 6–73%), and remaining risk to age 85 for 
AD, along with AD risk curves (25, 30, 31). Participants randomized into AD+CAD arms 
were also provided with the following statement in oral and written form, regardless of

 genotype: “In addition to Alzheimer’s disease, APOE has been found to be connected to 
heart disease. Some studies have shown that people who carry e4 also have a higher risk of 
developing heart disease. Potential strategies to reduce the risk of coronary artery disease 
include smoking cessation, a healthy diet, weight loss, treatment of elevated cholesterol, and 
exercise (with your doctor’s permission).” This information was reiterated after each follow-
up session. The statement was crafted to be appropriate for secondary findings disclosure 
during AD risk assessment by a study cardiologist (D.L.B.) after conferring with 
cardiologists unrelated to the REVEAL Study.
Outcomes and Follow-Up
Outcomes were assessed at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after disclosure, as 
summarized in Appendix Table 1. Co-primary outcomes were validated scales of anxiety 
and depression at one year, using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (33) and the Center for 
Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) (34). BAI scores range from 0–63 (>8: 
mild, >15: moderate, >25: severe). CES-D scores range from 0–60 (>10: mild, >16: 
moderate, >26: severe) (35). Anxiety and depression scores at 6 weeks and 6 months, as well 
as time-averaged, were secondary outcomes. Test-related distress specific to the genetic risk 
assessment at all time points was another secondary outcome, measured with the Impact of 
Event Scale (IES) (36, 37). IES scores range from 0–75 (≥20: significant distress). For safety 
purposes, an ESB-approved plan required immediate interview of participants whose BAI or 
CES-D scores exceeded 25 or 26, respectively, or increased by more than 15 points from 
baseline.
Secondary outcomes also included changes to health behaviors (diet, exercise, medications, 
dietary supplements, stress reduction, and mental activities) at 12 months after disclosure. At 
6 weeks following disclosure, participants were asked, “Since you learned your APOE test 
results, have you made any health or wellness changes?” Participants responding 
affirmatively answered additional questions about the types of behavior change they had 
initiated. At 12 months, participants were asked a) if they had continued the changes 
reported at 6 weeks and b) about additional changes initiated since the 6-week survey. 
Participants were coded as having made a health behavior change at 12 months if they 
continued a behavior reported at 6 weeks or if they initiated a behavior between the 6-week 
and 12-month surveys. Physical activity was assessed using the Rapid Assessment of 
Physical Activity (RAPA) (38) which scored participants on a 1–7 scale for aerobic activity 
and a 0–3 scale for strength and flexibility training. Smoking status was assessed at baseline 
and 12 months by asking participants if they had smoked within the prior seven days. To 
assess recall of pleiotropic information, each follow-up survey asked participants in AD
+CAD arms, “What other disease did we tell you is associated with the APOE gene?”
Statistical Analysis
We estimated that 32 participants would need to receive genetic risk disclosure in each group 
to achieve 80% power to detect 5 point differences between AD+CAD and AD-only 
randomization arms (39). Enrollment targets of 70 at each study site were set to enroll 280 
total participants and to achieve 256 total disclosures, assuming 10% dropout. The expanded 
sample size was set to allow for sub-analyses by APOE genotypes and demographic factors.

 T-tests and chi-square tests compared demographic features and discontinuation rates of 
AD-only and AD+CAD groups, and participant variables associated with discontinuation. 
The protocol was initially designed under a superiority framework, but prior to seeing data 
and conducting data analyses, we concluded that the scientific aims were best served by use 
of equivalence comparisons. Data for telephone and in-person disclosure arms were pooled 
in analyses presented here because interactions between AD-only/AD+CAD randomization 
status and in-person/telephone disclosure randomization status were not observed (p-values 
for tests of interactions: BAI: p=0.18; CES-D: p=0.34; IES: p=0.68; p-values for tests of 3 
way interactions between the two treatment arms and time were all ≥ 0.40). Two participants 
who did not receive genotype and AD risk disclosure and whose randomization status was 
mistakenly entered into the study database as AD-only were recoded as AD+CAD for 
analyses of study drop out.
We used longitudinal analyses for psychological outcomes, including all observed data and 
imputing data for the few missing observations from participants who received genetic risk 
disclosure. Since the distribution of these outcomes was skewed, we used generalized linear 
models fit with generalized estimating equations with log link and Gamma distribution to 
compare outcomes by AD-only/AD+CAD randomization status. We used an autoregressive 
working correlation structure with robust standard errors to account for the repeated 
measures within participant. A value of one was added to all measures to shift the 
distribution away from zero. Models included terms for AD-only vs AD+CAD 
randomization status, time as a categorical variable, interaction between time and 
randomization arm, corresponding baseline psychological measure where applicable and the 
GC conducting disclosure. Additional analyses further adjusted for age, gender, education, 
race, family history of AD, phone or in-person disclosure, and APOE genotype. We used 
contrasts to compare randomization arms at specific time points and overall for a time-
averaged comparison. Equivalence was defined using a margin of 5 points per prior 
REVEAL Study trials (24, 25). We used 95% CIs based on recommendations to use CIs of 
(1–2α) x 100% for equivalence testing and using α=2.5% (0.05/2) to account for multiple 
testing across two primary outcomes (40, 41). To be conservative and consistent across 
psychological outcomes, we also used 95% CIs for all secondary analyses. We evaluated 
whether interaction effects existed between AD-only/AD+CAD randomization status and 
APOE genotype because pleiotropic information might concern participants only if they 
were at increased risk for both diseases. We used the same model as described above and 
added variables for APOE ε4, its interaction with time, its interaction with pleiotropy 
randomization arm and three-way interaction for APOE ε4, time and pleiotropy 
randomization. From these analyses we also obtained results for each APOE stratum for 
secondary analyses, comparing pleiotropy arms. Additionally, we used contrasts from these 
models to estimate the differences between APOE ε4-positive and APOE ε4-negative 
participants within randomization arms.
Secondary analyses tested for differences in health behavior change rates and physical 
activity levels between AD-only and AD+CAD arms and by APOE status. Health behavior 
change rates were compared between groups using logistic regression, allowing for 
interaction with APOE genotype and adjusting for disclosing GC. Changes in physical 
activity levels were compared between randomization groups using multiple linear

 regression, adjusting for APOE genotype, and genetic counselor providing disclosure. 
Changes to smoking status were assessed, but omitted from reporting due to small numbers 
of current smokers (13 enrolled).
Because APOE genotypes could not be reliably imputed, analyses included only participants 
receiving genetic risk information (genotype data for participants who provided blood but 
dropped out of the study before the disclosure session was destroyed per the IRB-approved 
protocol). Two study participants in the AD-only arms and 2 study participants of the AD
+CAD arms were excluded from analysis for this reason. Twenty of the remaining 257 study 
participants were missing BAI, CES-D, and IES scores. We assumed data were missing at 
random and imputed missing values for these outcomes using multiple imputation (Markov 
Chain Monte Carlo procedures with 40 imputed data sets. See Appendix). All analyses were 
conducted using SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).
Role of the Funding Source
This study was funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute of the National 
Institutes of Health, which had no role in study design; collection, analysis, or interpretation 
of data; writing, review, or approval of the manuscript; or the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication.
RESULTS
Of 290 participants randomized, 257 (89%) received genetic risk disclosure (Figure 1). Four 
were screened out for the following reasons: cognitive score below eligibility criteria, high 
depression, ambiguous family history of AD, and failure to attend study appointments. 
Demographic characteristics did not vary by AD-only/AD+CAD randomization, other than 
by race (Table 1) and were similar to those of our previous trials (24, 29) except for the 
deliberate inclusion of participants without an affected FDR. GCs communicated results to 
between 9 and 82 participants apiece, and did not differ statistically in their likelihoods of 
being randomized to disclose AD-only or AD+CAD information (p=0.58). Drop out before 
disclosure occurred in 8% of AD-only and 15% of AD+CAD participants (p=0.06). 
Younger, female, unmarried and less educated participants were more likely to drop out (all 
p<0.05), regardless of AD-only/AD+CAD randomization (Appendix Table 2). At all time 
points, a high proportion of AD+CAD participants (81.3% at 6 weeks, 86.4% at 6 months, 
84.4% at 12 months) correctly recalled receiving risk information about the association 
between APOE and CAD.
Anxiety, Depression and Test-Related Distress
Mean anxiety, depression, and test-related distress scores were below cut-offs for mood 
disorders, regardless of disclosure protocol, at all time points and when time-averaged (Table 
2). All 95% confidence bounds for between arm differences were within a margin of ±5 
points. Equivalence was also supported in adjusted analyses (Appendix Table 3). 
Interactions between randomization status and time were not observed (BAI: p≥0.57; CES-
D: p≥0.07; IES: p≥0.26).

 Results on psychological scales by APOE group are presented in Table 3. Anxiety and 
depression scores remained well below cut-offs for concern regardless of ε4 status, and 95% 
confidence bounds for mean differences between AD-only and AD+CAD groups for each 
APOE genotype were within a margin of ±5 points at all time points. However, among 
APOE ε4-positive participants, mean IES scores were lower 12 months after AD+CAD 
disclosure, as compared to AD-only, whereas in APOE ε4-negative participants mean IES 
scores did not differ (mean Δ=−4.8, 95%CI −8.6 to −1.0, ε4-positive; 0.6, 95%CI −1.1 to 
2.2, ε4-negative; p-interaction=0.031). Differences by APOE status were also observed at 6 
months, when anxiety was modestly lower after AD+CAD disclosure in ε4-positive 
participants and modestly higher in ε4-negative participants (mean Δ=−1.8, 95%CI −3.2 to 
−0.4, ε4-positive; 1.1, 95%CI 0.1 to 2.0, ε4-negative; p-interaction=0.004). Findings from 
analyses stratified by APOE status were supported in adjusted analyses (Appendix Table 4).
Overall, 24% of study participants reported moderate anxiety, depression, or test-related 
distress at one or more follow-up time points, with no differences by AD-only/AD+CAD 
randomization over time (p=0.53). As in prior REVEAL Study trials (24, 25), mean IES 
scores were greater among APOE ε4-positive participants than APOE ε4-negative 
participants when only AD risk information was disclosed (12 month mean Δ=3.8, 95%CI 
0.7 to 6.9) while differences in mean depression scores by ε4 status within AD-only arms 
were not observed (12 month mean Δ=1.6, 95%CI −0.9 to 4.0). Anxiety scores were higher 
among APOE ε4-positive than A-POE ε4-negative participants when only AD risk 
information was disclosed (12 month mean Δ=1.9, 95%CI 0.1 to 3.7). No differences were 
noted by ε4 status in AD+CAD arms.
Health Behavior Responses
Among all participants, 57% reported changing at least one health behavior at 12 months in 
response to genetic risk disclosure. Percentages reporting specific health behavior changes 
are reported in Appendix Table 5. Participants in AD+CAD arms were more likely than 
participants in AD-only arms to report changes to most queried health behaviors with 
differences being independent of APOE genotype (Figure 2). Among the 36 participants 
who reported a medication change, 9 (25%) made a change related to CAD (e.g., blood 
pressure or cholesterol medications, fiber supplements). Secondary analyses also showed 
that participants who were APOE ε4-positive were more likely to report changes than 
participants who were APOE ε4-negative on all health behaviors outcomes (Appendix Table 
5). Differences were not observed between AD+CAD and AD-only arms on 12 month 
aerobic activity scores (mean Δ=0.34, 95%CI −0.09 to 0.76) or strength and flexibility 
scores (mean Δ=−0.01, 95%CI −0.35 to 0.33). Of additional note, 33% of participants in the 
AD+CAD arms reported sharing results with a health professional, compared to 22% of 
participants in the AD-only arms (p=0.063).
DISCUSSION
We report a randomized trial of disclosing pleiotropic risk information during a genetic risk 
assessment for AD. Participants receiving AD risk plus secondary information about CAD 
risk responded equivalently to participants receiving only AD risk on primary outcomes of

 anxiety and depression, with no differences in mean scores at any time point and confidence 
intervals within conservative margins for clinical significance. However, participants at 
increased risk for disease (APOE ε4-positive) appeared to have experienced less test-related 
distress at 12 months if they also received CAD information. The vast majority of other 
studies in disclosure of genetic risk have shown no impact of genetic risk disclosure on 
general measures of mood, but occasional short-term increases in test-related distress among 
individuals at increased risk for disease (42). Our results build on those findings by 
suggesting that “positive pleiotropic disclosure,” i.e., return of unsolicited risk information 
about a modifiable condition like CAD, may reduce distress experienced when receiving risk 
information about a less readily modifiable condition like AD. These findings prompt the 
interesting speculation that worry about medically non-actionable genetic risk results may be 
mitigated by simultaneously providing actionable genetic risk results. Our study did not 
address “negative pleiotropic disclosure,” such as choosing to learn APOE genotype for 
CAD risk and incidentally discovering its implications for AD risk, which could have 
yielded different results.
Nearly every health behavior assessed was reportedly improved in response to AD+CAD 
information, regardless of APOE status. The statement about strategies to reduce coronary 
artery disease risk, given to all participants in the AD+CAD arms, may explain differences 
in reported changes in health behavior. However, participants receiving AD+CAD 
information tended to be more likely to report sharing results with a health professional, who 
may have in turn encouraged health behavior changes. Pleiotropic disclosure may also have 
prompted individuals who had been focused on AD to attend to a more modifiable and 
prevalent condition in CAD. APOE ε4-positive participants in both randomization arms 
were more likely to report changes to all health behaviors than APOE ε4-negative 
participants despite receiving education that highlighted a lack of proven AD risk-reducing 
options. It is possible that learning about an increased risk for AD and addressing pleiotropic 
outcomes are motivating individuals to be healthier in general rather than motivating steps to 
reduce risk for a specific disease.
Our participants were generally well-educated individuals who volunteered for genetic risk 
assessment for AD, were not representative of the general population and were more likely 
to have known about APOE-CAD associations independent of our study. Our study focused 
on pleiotropic information disclosure during single-gene testing for AD, and may not 
generalize to other conditions or to contexts like genomic sequencing that can explore 
broader sets of genetic variants and diseases. Our study excluded one individual with low 
cognitive testing score as well as one participant with severe depression, raising the 
possibility that results could be different among more vulnerable populations. We 
additionally omitted 33 randomized participants who dropped out of the study before being 
genotyped. Self-reported outcomes, particularly those measuring health behaviors, are 
subject to bias where participants respond in ways they expect investigators want them to 
respond (43). Some of our health behavior measures have not been validated and do not 
provide insight about whether changes were clinically meaningful, although our physical 
activity measure has demonstrated validity for older adults (38). Finally, clinical outcomes 
associated with health behavior measures (e.g., weight loss) were not assessed.

 Our study examined only one strategy for communicating APOE-CAD associations. 
Because of questions about the strength of the APOE-CAD relationship at the time of our 
study, our disclosure statement deliberately omitted quantified risk estimates for CAD that 
may have made pleiotropic disclosure more impactful. Indeed, meta-analyses published 
during our study suggest that ε4 carriers’ increased CAD risk may be modest (23). Further 
complicating the issue, APOE may be associated with other neurological and ocular 
disorders (44). As the field transitions to technologies that identify a wider array of 
secondary and incidental genomic findings, laboratories and clinicians will need to make 
difficult decisions about what kinds of findings merit disclosure, as well as how to do so.
Nevertheless, our data support the safety of disclosing secondary, pleiotropic information 
about a modifiable condition such as CAD during genetic risk assessment for AD, and 
suggest the counter-intuitive inference that such disclosure may mitigate test-related distress 
among those who learn that they are at increased risk for not one, but two life-threatening 
conditions.

AD+CAD vs. AD-Only differences in the percent reporting health behavior changes 12 
months after genetic risk disclosure.*
* Plots display between arm (AD+CAD – AD-Only) differences in the percentage of 
participants reporting a health behavior change. Estimates are from an analysis using logistic 
regression, accounting for APOE status, its interaction with pleiotropy randomization arm 
and the genetic counselor providing disclosure (except for stress reduction, where genetic 
counselor was omitted because some combinations of randomization status, APOE status, 
and genetic counselor had no events). Adjusted percentages are conditional probabilities 
estimated from the logistic model with all covariates set to their mean values (SAS lsmeans). 
P-values for interaction correspond to the p-values from the randomization arm x APOE 
status interaction terms. Unadjusted number of participants reporting changes to each health 
behavior: diet, 86; exercise, 91; mental activities, 76; dietary supplements, 71; stress 
reduction, 57; medications, 37.
