Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a serious neurodevelopmental disorder that affects one in 45 
children in the United States, with a similarly striking prevalence in countries around the world. 
However, mechanisms underlying its etiology and manifestations remain poorly understood. 
While ASD is diagnosed based on the presence and severity of impaired social communication 
and repetitive behavior, immune dysregulation and gastrointestinal issues are common co-
morbidities. The microbiome is an integral part of human physiology; recent studies show that 
changes in the gut microbiota can modulate gastrointestinal physiology, immune function and even 
behavior. Links between particular bacteria from the indigenous gut microbiota and phenotypes 
relevant to ASD raise the important question of whether microbial dysbiosis plays a role in the 
development or presentation of ASD symptoms. Here we review reports of microbial dysbiosis in 
ASD. We further discuss potential effects of the microbiota on ASD-associated symptoms, 
drawing upon signaling mechanisms for reciprocal interactions between the microbiota, immunity, 
gut function and behavior. In addition, we discuss recent findings supporting a role for the 
microbiome as an interface between environmental and genetic risk factors that are associated with 
ASD. These studies highlight the integration of pathways across multiple body systems that 
together can impact brain and behavior and suggest that changes in the microbiome may 
contribute to symptoms of neurodevelopmental disease.

 spectrum of behavioral abnormalities in ASD, several medical comorbidities are also 
observed in ASD individuals, ranging from seizures and anxiety to sleep deficiency and 
metabolic impairments (1–5). Brain changes in ASD include a reported 67% more neurons 
in the prefrontal cortex, more than 17% increase in brain weight, and abnormal cortical 
patterning. Further transcriptomic analysis of postmortem brains from human ASD 
individuals revealed altered expression of proteins that are important for functional synaptic 
activity in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum (6–9). In addition, several brain imaging 
studies in living patients report correlations between abnormal frontal lobe connectivity, 
cortical morphology, amygdala activation and language control centers in ASD individuals 
compared to neurotypical controls (10–13).
The exact causes of ASD are unclear but are believed to involve a combination of genetic 
and environmental risk factors. It is estimated that the de novo mutations, common variants 
and short nucleotide polymorphisms identified across numerous ASD cases altogether 
account for approximately 50% of the disorder (14, 15). As such, many studies highlight the 
possibility for environmental risk factors and associated medical co-morbidities to contribute 
to core neurobehavioral symptoms of the disorder. Immune dysregulation and 
gastrointestinal disturbances are of particular interest in light of numerous studies reporting 
ASD-associated abnormalities in the peripheral, enteric and neuro-immune system. 
Postmortem brains of ASD patients show increased microglia and astroglia activation in the 
cerebellum and cerebral cortex, along with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in 
the cerebrospinal fluid and cortical regions of the brain (16). Moreover, there are ASD-
associated genes that encode for features of the immune system, and mutations in those 
genes are linked with ASD phenotype, including loss of structural and functional 
connectivity in brain regions important for socio-communicative function (17, 18). Parallel 
studies reveal greater prevalence of gastrointestinal disorders and disturbances in ASD 
populations compared to controls (19, 20). Co-morbid gastrointestinal symptoms in subsets 
of ASD individuals include diarrhea/constipation, abdominal pain and gastric reflux. 
Deficient integrity of the gut epithelium and increased intestinal permeability are also 
reported (21).
These associations of ASD with greater prevalence of immune dysregulation and 
gastrointestinal issues motivate explorations of the ASD gut microbiome, which is emerging 
as a key regulator of intestinal physiology, neuroimmunity and host behavior. Many studies 
report dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in ASD individuals. Perhaps most intriguingly, 
gnotobiotic animal and probiotic studies demonstrate that microbiome changes can directly 
cause behavioral and neuropathological endophenotypes of human ASD. This avenue of 
research is critical for determining roles for microbiota dysbiosis and specific bacterial 
species that may contribute to and/or modify symptoms of ASD. In this review, we examine 
links between the microbiome and ASD symptoms, drawing upon data from animal 
experiments showing causal effects of the microbiome on immunity, brain and behavior. We 
further explore the notion that the microbiome plays an important role in mediating 
symptoms of ASD, and may be a key consideration for understanding immune and GI 
dysfunction in subsets of ASD individuals.

 Gut microbiota on ASD-related endophenotypes in animal models
The microbiota plays an important role in regulating normal host physiology, metabolism, 
nutrition, and brain function. Since mammals are unable to synthesize many key nutrients, 
the gut microbiota assumes a primary role in digestion, synthesizing essential dietary 
vitamins and co-factors, such as vitamin B, riboflavin, thiamine and folate. In addition to 
roles for the microbiome in regulating digestion, GI physiology and immunity, increasing 
research reveals the ability of the gut microbiota to signal across the so-called “microbiota-
gut-brain axis”. Raising animals in the absence of microbial colonization results in 
abnormalities in a variety of complex behaviors, pointing to the possibility that the 
microbiota modulates behavioral outcomes in animal models of neurodevelopmental and 
neurological disorders. Social communication deficits and the presence of stereotyped 
behaviors are hallmark diagnostic features of human ASD, and other behavioral 
abnormalities, such as anxiety, seizures, and hyperactivity are often co-morbid. Two 
independent studies demonstrate that germ-free mice exhibit decreased sociability or 
propensity to interact with a novel mouse versus non-social object, and reduced social 
preference to interact with an unfamiliar versus familiar mouse (22, 23). This is similarly 
seen in germ-free rats, which exhibit reduced social investigation of an unfamiliar partner 
(24). Germ-free mice also display differential gene expression, exon usage and RNA-editing 
in the amygdala, a key emotional center of the brain mediating responses to social stimuli 
(25). Interestingly, social behavioral abnormalities are impaired particularly in male mice, 
which parallels the male bias that is characteristic of ASD. Moreover, some of the social 
impairments are corrected by postnatal colonization of germ-free mice with a wildtype 
mouse gut microbiota at weaning, pointing to the ability to reverse abnormalities in social 
interactions (26). This is intriguing in light of reports that risperidone, an FDA-approved 
treatment for autism, does not correct social abnormalities in human ASD or mouse models 
of ASD (27, 28).
Modulation of the maternal environment is also of interest given the neurodevelopmental 
origins of ASD. Though there are numerous perinatal risk factors that influence maternal-
fetal physiology including stress, infection, gestational diabetes, breast- versus formula-
feeding, maternal age, antibiotic use and obesity, the changes in the gut microbiota can also 
be a relevant risk factor. A recent study by Buffington et al. showed that high fat diet 
induced-maternal obesity alters the offspring gut microbiome and causes social behavioral 
deficits that are linked to altered signaling in the mesolimbic reward system (29). 
Remarkably, transfer of the gut microbiota from control mice into offspring of high fat diet-
fed mothers completely corrected the impairments in sociability and social novelty seen in 
the mice, demonstrating a key role for the gut microbiome in regulating mouse social 
behavior. Furthermore, treatment with the gut bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri alone 
sufficiently restores social behaviors, revealing specificity of social behavioral modulation in 
this model to a particular bacterial taxon. The beneficial effect of the microbiome in these 
studies was associated with its ability to promote hypothalamic levels of oxytocin and 
activation of neurons in the ventral tegmental area. This novel finding supports the promise 
of probiotic treatments for social behaviors. Importantly, however, we caution against use of 
L. reuteri for ASD until additional studies examine broader physiological effects of the

 bacterium on host biology and until such exploratory treatments are validated to be safe and 
effective in humans.
In addition to social interaction, there is some evidence that manipulation of the microbiome 
by probiotic treatment can modulate communicative and repetitive behavior in mice. In a 
mouse model of maternal immune activation, a principal environmental risk factor for 
autism, mice develop core behavioral features of ASD (impaired social communication and 
stereotyped behaviors), as well as several neuropathologies and co-morbid gastrointestinal 
and immunological symptoms relevant to the human disorder (30–32). Altering the postnatal 
gut microbiota by early life treatment with the human gut bacterium Bacteroides fragilis 
sufficiently ameliorated deficits in the frequency and quality of adult ultrasonic vocalizations 
and reduced stereotypic burying behavior exhibited by the ASD-like mice. While the 
mechanisms underlying the ability of the gut microbiota to modulate ASD-related behaviors 
are unclear, improvements in gastrointestinal integrity and alterations in serum metabolites 
could be involved. Consistent with a possible role for the microbiome in contributing to the 
symptoms of ASD, it would be interesting to examine the presence and severity of ASD-
related behavioral and neuropathological abnormalities in ASD animal models raised on a 
germ-free background or depleted of gut microbes using treatment with broad spectrum 
antibiotics. Such studies would enable dissection of causal mechanisms linking the 
microbiome to core ASD behaviors and neuropathologies.
Anxiety-like behavior is also observed in subsets of individuals with ASD and is commonly 
recapitulated in animal models for ASD. The microbiome modulates anxiety-like behavior 
in mice, as germ-free mice exhibit increased locomotor activity and decreased anxietylike 
behavior in several tasks, including open field exploration, the elevated plus maze, light-dark 
box and platform step-down test (25, 33, 34). These behavioral changes are correlated with 
altered expression of genes involved in second messenger pathways and synaptic 
transmission, including PSD-95 and synaptophysin in the striatum (35). Moreover, these 
behavioral changes can be related to learning and memory deficits seen in both germ-free 
and antibiotic-treated mice (36, 37).
Germ-free animals also exhibit several abnormalities in brain gene expression and 
neurophysiology. For example, abnormal transcriptomic profiles are observed across the 
frontal cortex, striatum, amygdala and hippocampus (35), with altered expression of genes 
important for synaptic long-term potentiation, steroid hormone metabolism and neuronal 
transmission. Consistent with this, many studies report microbiome-mediated alterations in 
levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and synaptic proteins (23, 26, 33, 34, 36, 
38). In addition, differences in serotonergic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic signaling are 
observed in germ-free mice compared to conventionally-colonized controls (26, 34, 35, 39, 
40). Germ free mice also display an exaggerated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, with 
elevated corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels in response to stress. 
Furthermore, germ-free mice also exhibit increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis 
compared to conventionally colonized controls (41). Interestingly, several of these effects are 
reversed upon colonization with a conventional gut microbiota, or even specific bacterial 
species (Table 1), suggesting that there are dynamic interactions across the microbiota-gut-
brain axis that persists through adulthood.

 Potential roles for the microbiome in ASD
Alterations in the gut microbiota are observed in ASD individuals compared to neurotypical 
controls (Table 1). Fecal bacterial profiling reveals a higher abundance of bacteria in the 
genus Clostridium in ASD patients (42–44). ASD patients also exhibited decreased 
Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio, increased Lactobacillus and Desulfovibrio species, which 
correlated with ASD severity (45). ASD severity was also linked to a reduction in SCFAs, 
including acetate, proprionate and butyrate (19), which are modulated by gut microbes. 
Bacterial genera important for carbohydrate-degradation and fermentation, including 
Prevotella, Coprococcus and Veilonellaceae, were decreased in ASD patients (46, 47). On 
the other hand, ASD patients were shown to have elevated abundance of Sutterella, which 
regulates mucosal metabolism and intestinal epithelial integrity (20, 48). Together, these 
studies suggest that ASD is associated with altered composition and function of the gut 
microbiota.
Despite these reports of microbial dysbiosis in ASD, there is little consensus on specific 
bacterial species that are similarly altered across separate studies. That is, no defined 
microbial signature has been identified for ASD, though many studies report microbiome 
differences within independent cohorts of ASD and controls (Table 1). Several factors could 
contribute to these discrepancies, including methodological variations and inherent 
heterogeneity of ASD cohorts based on symptom severity, co-morbid conditions, varied 
lifestyle and medical history. ASD-associated alterations in eating behavior and diet are 
likely to play a role, as the gut microbiota can be stably altered in response to dietary 
changes and exposures to xenobiotics (49).
Whether alterations in the microbiota may contribute to development of ASD is unknown. 
Interestingly, a small clinical study of vancomycin treatment in ASD children reported some 
improvements in ASD behaviors, which waned when antibiotic treatment was discontinued 
(50), suggesting that the microbiome may contribute actively to the severity of behavioral 
abnormalities in ASD. Particular case studies also link antibiotic treatment to improvements 
in ASD behaviors and co-morbid conditions (51). In addition, the antibiotics d-cycloserine 
and minocycline are promising in light of their ability to treat behavioral symptoms of ASD 
in clinical trials and animal models (52–54). While both antibiotics are used to treat 
infections, their neuroprotective effects are commonly attributed to their roles as partial 
NMDA receptor agonist and microglial activation inhibitor, respectively.
Links between the gut microbiome and ASD-associated GI abnormalities
GI symptoms are variably present in ASD individuals (Table 2), ranging from 9–90% in 
prevalence (55, 56). Although the precise incidence varies from study to study, there is a 
general consensus that GI problems are common in individuals with autism (57) and that 
they could potentiate behavioral issues (57). A large meta-analysis of autism cases versus 
controls from 1980 to 2012 reveals greater incidence of intestinal symptoms, such as 
diarrhea, constipation and abdominal pain, despite high methodological variability. 
Consistent with this, a multicenter study of over 14,000 ASD individuals reports a higher 
prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease and other bowel disorders in ASD patients

 compared to controls (4). Notably, in an examination of 960 children from the CHildhood 
Autism Risks from Genetics and Environment (CHARGE) study, frequency of abdominal 
pain, diarrhea, constipation or gaseousness was associated with greater social withdrawal, 
stereotypy, irritability and hyperactivity as measured by the Abberant Behaviors Checklist 
(ABC) (58). Autism severity was also strongly correlated to the presence of gastrointestinal 
symptoms as measured by the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) and GI 
severity index (6-GSI) (57).
Whether any changes in the microbiome are caused by GI symptoms or whether they 
contribute to the manifestation of GI symptoms in ASD is unclear. Gut microbes influence 
various aspects of gut physiology, including intestinal barrier integrity, epithelial cell 
regeneration, mucus production and gastrointestinal motility (59). Interestingly, the severity 
of GI symptoms in ASD has been associated with alterations in the gut microbiota in 
response to treatment with antibiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics (57). In light of the intricate 
interactions of the gut microbiome with the gut epithelium, (57) it would be interesting to 
examine if microbiome abnormalities in ASD are enriched in or even specific to ASD 
individuals with co-morbid gastrointestinal issues. In addition, investigations into whether 
particular microbiome changes are associated with specific ASD-associated dietary 
regimens, treatments and co-morbid medical symptoms would be of significant interest.
Links between the gut microbiome and ASD-associated immune 
dysregulation
The gut microbiota exhibits important bidirectional interactions with the immune system. 
Many facets of immunity are dysregulated in ASD (Table 3). Alterations in circulating and 
brain cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory factors are frequently observed in 
ASD, as well as abnormal distributions and/or responsiveness of various leukocyte subtypes 
(16–18, 60). These particular ASD-related immune abnormalities are the subject of several 
recent reviews (17, 18, 61). Many of the immunophenotypes seen in ASD are consistent 
with elevated “proinflammatory” status, as indicated by an increase in cytokines and 
chemokines including IFN-γ, IL-β, IL-6, IL-12p40, TNF-α, MCP-1, TGFβ and CCL-2, as 
well as a hyperactive cellular immune responses (62–65). However, ASD patients 
demonstrate varying immune abnormalities including differential changes in their immune/
cytokine profiles, as well as the degree of changes (66), making it difficult to pinpoint direct 
links between immune and microbiota alterations in ASD individuals. In addition, 
confounding factors such as patient-to-patient variability in diet, lifestyle, and genetics can 
also modify immune activity. Nevertheless, subsets ASD individuals exhibit aberrant 
immune activation. Many of the immunophenotypes observed involve factors and pathways 
that are known to be influenced by the gut microbiota, raising the question of whether ASD-
associated microbial dysbiosis can contribute to the widespread immune dysregulation seen 
in ASD individuals.
i. The microbiome and neuroimmune abnormalities of ASD
Both elevated microglial activation and altered microglia to neuron spatial distribution 
patterns are seen in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum of postmortem ASD brains (16, 67–
Vuong and Hsiao

 69) and surrogate markers of increased microglial activation are observed by PET imaging 
of living ASD individuals (70). Interestingly, Erny and colleagues demonstrate that the 
microbiome is required for proper development and function of adult brain microglia (71). 
Microglia from germ-free mice exhibit altered transcriptomes including downregulation of 
cell activation genes (eg. Mapk 8, Fcgr2β, and Hif1α), reduction of genes for type 1 IFN 
receptor signaling (eg. Jak3 and Stat1), and upregulation of microglia transcription and 
survival factors (eg. Sfpi1 and Csf1r), as compared to those isolated from conventionally-
colonized controls. Microglia from germ-free mice also exhibit altered morphology, with 
longer processes and increased branching. Following exposure to bacterial or viral 
challenge, microglia from germ-free mice maintain altered morphology and reduced 
inflammatory responses compared to those from conventionally-colonized mice. 
Remarkably, re-colonization of adult gnotobiotic mice with a conventional gut microbiota or 
supplementation with SCFAs, the primary products of bacterial fermentation, sufficiently 
corrects these deficiencies in microglial activation (71). These findings suggest that 
indigenous gut microbes reversibly modulate microglial function, and further motivate the 
identification of specific bacterial species from the gut microbiota that confer these neuro-
immunomodulatory effects.
ii. Peripheral immune regulation and the microbiome
Various systemic immune abnormalities observed in ASD may also be influenced by the 
microbiota. For example, specific bacterial species from the gut microbiota regulate 
differentiation of T lymphocyte subtypes. Colonization with segmented filamentous bacteria 
stimulates the accumulation of inflammatory IL-17-producing Th17 cells via the acute phase 
protein serum amyloid A, which predisposes to symptoms of autoimmune disease in animal 
models (72, 73). In contrast, both Bacteroides fragilis and a particular consortium of 
Clostridial species upregulate levels of IL-10-producing T regulatory cells. By this 
mechanism, B. fragilis and Clostridial consortium sufficiently correct symptoms of intestinal 
disease and multiple sclerosis in animal models (74, 75) and continue to be tested for 
clinical translation into patient populations. The interplay between the gut microbiome and 
immune system could be relevant to the immune dysregulation observed in ASD, where 
abnormal distributions and functions of various leukocyte subtypes are observed. For 
example, deficiencies in regulatory T cells and other T helper cell subtypes are reported in 
ASD individuals compared to controls (76). In addition, peripheral blood monocytes and 
macrophages from ASD individuals are hyperresponsive to stimulation as compared to those 
isolated from neurotypical controls, and the microbiota fundamentally regulates systemic 
myeloid development and differentiation (77, 78).
Overall, this research raises the fascinating question of whether microbial dysbiosis can 
contribute to the immune dysregulation seen in ASD, such as microglial activation and T 
regulatory cell deficits, and whether manipulations of the microbiota can ameliorate ASD-
related immune abnormalities. While parallel studies of immune problems in ASD and 
effects of the microbiome on the immune system are revealing some converging pathways, 
additional preclinical studies are required to determine whether microbiome changes in ASD 
can sufficiently cause any of the immune abnormalities seen in the disorder. Moreover, it 
will be important to determine whether existing animal models for ASD, which display core

 behavioral and neuropathological symptoms of the disorder, also exhibit immune 
abnormalities and microbiome changes seen in ASD. Such associations have been reported 
in a few mouse models of ASD environmental risk factors (32, 79), but information for 
additional environmental and genetic models is currently lacking.
The microbiome as a potential mediator of risk factors in ASD
While there is evidence that ASD-associated microbial dysbiosis could modulate 
corresponding immune, gastrointestinal and even behavioral symptoms, whether 
microbiome alterations contribute to the etiopathogenesis of ASD is unclear. Idiopathic ASD 
is thought to be a result of a combination of several genetic and environmental factors that 
each contributes a fraction of disease risk. The strong concordance of ASD in monozygotic 
twins compared to dizygotic twins reveals an ASD heritability rate of about 50% (80, 81). 
Several genetic factors increase ASD risk, including short nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs), copy number variants (CNVs) and de novo mutations in genes involved in synaptic 
transmission and neuronal activity (82–84). Interestingly, some ASD susceptibility genes 
encode components of the immune system (17). In addition, several environmental risk 
factors have been identified to increase risk for autism.
The microbiota is well positioned at the intersection between genes and environment, as its 
composition and function are dependent on genetic background and critically shaped by 
environmental factors, including age, infection, diet and xenobiotics. Moreover, early life 
changes in the microbiota can have lasting effects on health and disease. For example, 
several diet-induced host phenotypes are sufficiently mediated by changes in the gut 
microbiota (85–88). The microbiota also conveys lasting effects of infection to the host (89) 
and can regulate epigenetic modification of the host genome (90, 91). Interestingly, 
microbiota mediated epigenetic changes can determine host transcriptional profiles. For 
example, SCFA butyrate can act as an HDAC inhibitor. HDAC are involved in cell cycle 
progression, gene silencing, differentiation, and genotoxic responses (92).
Whether the microbiota mediates effects of genetic and/or environmental risk factors on the 
development of ASD symptoms is unclear. However, increasing evidence suggests that the 
microbiota is altered in response to etiological risk factors for ASD. Maternal infection is a 
primary environmental risk factor for ASD based on numerous epidemiological, clinical and 
animal studies (93–98). Modeling maternal immune activation in mice results in global 
changes in the composition of the adult offspring microbiome (99, 100). This microbial 
dysbiosis is correlated with lasting behavioral abnormalities, neuropathologies, immune 
dysfunction and deficient gastrointestinal integrity. Interestingly, altering the microbiome via 
postnatal treatment with the human commensal B. fragilis improved gastrointestinal 
physiology and performance in some tasks measuring core ASD-related behaviors. 
Similarly, modeling maternal exposure to valproic acid, an anticonvulsant drug that is 
associated with increased risk for ASD, (79, 101) rendered offspring with lasting changes in 
gut microbiota composition, as well as neuroinflammation, abnormal gastrointestinal 
physiology and ASD-related behavioral abnormalities (79). Whether exposures to ASD risk 
factors also result in microbiome alterations and whether there are any similarities across

 microbiota impairments across differing insults are important questions for future 
investigation.
Importantly, alterations in the maternal microbiome in response to environmental risk 
exposure or genetic risk transmission can be passed onto offspring at birth. The developing 
embryo is largely devoid of microbial colonization, and a preponderance of evidence 
suggests that mammals inherit their initial microbiome through the birthing process. Mode 
of birth, whether through natural birthing process or Caesarean section (C-section), drives 
the initial seeding of the infant microbiome, such that babies delivered via the vaginal canal 
can be discriminated from those delivered by C-section based on their microbiome (102–
104). This has significant implications for developmental disorders, including ASD, where 
maternal or prenatal exposures to genetic or environmental risk are believed to contribute to 
disease etiopathogenesis. Animal models demonstrate that microbiome changes in response 
to maternal stress are passed onto offspring at birth, setting in motion microbial dysbiosis 
that persists into adulthood (105–107). Maternal-to-offspring transmission is also believed to 
cause the chronic microbiota abnormalities seen in adult offspring of immune-activated 
mothers (18). Consistent with this, some studies report that C-section is associated with 
elevated risk for ASD in the offspring (108, 109), though one reported no link between C-
section and ASD symptoms (110). While recent studies show offspring delivered by C-
section have reduced microbial diversity compared to those by vaginal birth (111–113), there 
is also evidence that early life microbiome is plastic and other exposures can shape the infant 
microbiota. Other confounding perinatal risk factors for ASD that appear with C-section but 
are unrelated to the microbiome include anesthesia applied during labor, preterm birth, 
maternal age, and oxytocin administration. Future studies will require careful consideration 
of study subjects and perinatal risk factors.
Future directions for investigating effects of the microbiome on ASD
Emerging studies suggest the microbiota is an important regulator of gastrointestinal 
physiology, immune function and behavior (Figure 1). Abnormalities in each of these 
domains are reported in ASD, but additional characterization of co-morbid medical 
symptoms is required to clarify the nature, strength and reproducibility of specific 
associations. Evaluation of genetic background, medical history and ASD severity, among 
other variables, would provide insight into whether particular symptoms are enriched in 
specific subtypes of ASD and would further drive hypotheses regarding possible 
contributions of microbial dysbiosis, gastrointestinal dysfunction and/or immune 
dysregulation to the development or persistence of ASD behaviors. Similar efforts to 
characterize co-morbid microbiota, GI and immune symptoms across new and existing 
animal models for ASD are needed, with an emphasis on identifying converging phenotypic 
signatures across models of different genetic and environmental ASD risk factors. Further 
experiments are required to determine whether microbiome, gastrointestinal and/or immune 
abnormalities can sufficiently cause primary behavioral features of ASD. Such investigations 
should begin with studies using gnotobiotic or xenobiotic animals to identify peripheral 
targets and specific brain changes for development of novel ASD therapeutics. Of particular 
relevance to ASD-related microbial dysbiosis studies, it would be important to determine 
whether fecal transplant of ASD microbiota into animals is sufficient to cause behavioral

controlled studies on the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplant in ASD patients would 
provide much-needed guidance for the ASD community.

 Figure 1. Model for Roles of the Microbiome in Autism Spectrum Disorder
The microbiota is shaped by host genetics and environmental exposures. Select genetic and 
environmental risk factors for ASD could directly cause changes in the indigenous 
microbiota. Alternatively, the microbiota could be indirectly influenced by other medical co-
morbidities associated with ASD, including gastrointestinal issues and immune dysfunction. 
The microbiota exhibits reciprocal interactions with the gastrointestinal tract, immune 
system, brain and behavior and abnormalities in any one component of this integrated 
system could the others. In particular, dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota, in addition to 
immune and gastrointestinal symptoms seen in ASD, can influence neurodevelopment, 
neural activity and the manifestation of abnormal behaviors characteristic to ASD.
