SUMMARY
Currently there are no approved vaccines or specific
therapies to prevent or treat Zika virus (ZIKV) infec-
tion. We interrogated a library of FDA-approved
drugs for their ability to block infection of human
HuH-7 cells by a newly isolated ZIKV strain (ZIKV
MEX_I_7). More than 20 out of 774 tested com-
pounds decreased ZIKV infection in our in vitro
screening assay. Selected compounds were further
validated for inhibition of ZIKV infection in human
cervical, placental, and neural stem cell lines, as
well as primary human amnion cells. Established
anti-flaviviral drugs (e.g., bortezomib and mycophe-
nolic acid) and others that had no previously known
antiviral activity (e.g., daptomycin) were identified
as inhibitors of ZIKV infection. Several drugs reduced
ZIKV infection across multiple cell types. This study
identifies drugs that could be tested in clinical
studies of ZIKV infection and provides a resource of
small molecules to study ZIKV pathogenesis.
INTRODUCTION
Arthropod-borne flaviviruses, particularly those transmitted
by Aedes mosquitoes, pose significant threats to global health.
Zika virus (ZIKV) was isolated in 1947 in the Ziika Forest in
Uganda from a sentinel Rhesus macaque and subsequently
found in Aedes africanus mosquitoes (Dick et al., 1952). ZIKV
remained a footnote among neglected tropical diseases due to
the mild disease described from a limited number of cases.
That changed in 2007 when ZIKV emerged in a series of out-
breaks across the Pacific (Duffy et al., 2009; Dupont-Rouzeyrol
et al., 2015; Roth et al., 2014; Tognarelli et al., 2016) and changed
dramatically in 2014 and 2015 when Zika exploded into the
Americas, causing a large and expanding pandemic (Fauci and
Morens, 2016; Lednicky et al., 2016). One of the first countries
to be affected in the Americas was Brazil, where ZIKV has
caused an estimated 1.5 million infections (Weaver et al.,
2016). In the last year, diseases caused by/associated with
ZIKV infection have evolved to become a more pressing flaviviral
threat (Weaver et al., 2016). Since ZIKV can be transmitted by
Aedes species mosquitoes, which are widely distributed in
tropical and temperate regions of the world (Weaver et al.,
2016), it is likely that ZIKV has become pandemic.
Most human infections are transmitted by mosquito, although
ZIKV can spread directly from person to person through sexual
contact and also vertically from mother to fetus (Petersen
et al., 2016). This sets ZIKV apart from other pathogenic flavi-
viruses and creates significant and unexpected public health
concerns. ZIKV infection is usually asymptomatic, and most
symptomatic infections are mild and resemble those observed
with dengue: rash, fever, arthralgia, conjunctivitis, myalgia,
headache, and retro-orbital pain (Petersen et al., 2016). There
have been reports of hematospermia and symptoms resembling
prostatitis following infection (Foy et al., 2011), and viral RNA and
infectious virus have been detected in the semen of men weeks
after clearing of acute symptoms (Mansuy et al., 2016). Most
symptomatic ZIKV infections are self-limited and resolve in
less than a week; however, there are documented cases of
severe acute ZIKV infection in patients with other underlying
conditions (Arzuza-Ortega et al., 2016). Moreover, Zika has
been strongly associated with not only neurological sequelae,
most commonly Guillain-Barre
´ Syndrome, but also meningo-en-
cephalitis and myelitis (Fontes et al., 2016; Petersen et al., 2016).

 The most dreaded complications of infection occur in pregnancy
and include severe fetal abnormalities and death. An association
between microcephaly and ZIKV infection was first noted in
Brazil when a 20-fold increase in microcephaly was reported
from 2014 to 2015, and today, compelling geographic and
epidemiological evidence indicates a causal relationship be-
tween ZIKV and birth defects (Fauci and Morens, 2016; Kleber
de Oliveira et al., 2016; Rasmussen et al., 2016). This conclusion
is supported by finding ZIKV RNA and infectious virus in
placental and fetal tissues (Brasil et al., 2016; Mlakar et al.,
2016), and very recently by animal model studies that demon-
strate fetal infection and neurological damage in fetuses of
experimentally infected pregnant mice (Cugola et al., 2016;
Miner et al., 2016). The neurological complications and the se-
vere repercussions of ZIKV infection on the fetus have led the
World Health Organization to declare a global health emergency
and compel the scientific community to find solutions to the Zika
threat.
The first line of defense against Zika is preventing mosquito
bites using repellents or pesticides (Benelli, 2015). Unfortunately,
these methods failed to contain recent arbovirus epidemics.
There is no approved vaccine or specific therapy to prevent or
treat ZIKV infection, and physicians are restricted to adminis-
tering supportive care. Indeed, there is nothing that physicians
can do to prevent fetal damage from ZIKV infection during preg-
nancy or to prevent severe Zika outcomes in individuals with
underlying medical conditions.
To address the immediate need for anti-ZIKV therapy, we
interrogated a library of FDA-approved drugs for the ability to
block ZIKV infection. Our work identified more than 20 therapeu-
tics that decreased ZIKV infection in HuH-7 cells. Among these
were drugs previously shown to have anti-flaviviral activity and
some that had no previously reported antiviral activity. We
further showed that multiple drugs reduced ZIKV infection in
human cell lines derived from the female genital tract, placenta,
primary neural stem cells, and primary amniotic epithelial cells.
This study identifies drugs that could be immediately tested by
clinical experts for ZIKV infection during pregnancy or in the
context of severe ZIKV.
RESULTS
Isolation of a Pandemic ZIKV from Mosquitoes
In order to work with a pandemic ZIKV, we isolated ZIKV
MEX_I_7 from Ae aegypti mosquitos in Tapachula, Chiapas,
Mexico (Guerbois et al., 2016), re-sequenced the majority of
the genome by massively parallel sequencing, and compared
its open reading frame sequence with other publically available
ZIKV sequences (Figure S1). Phylogenetic analysis identified
the established African and Asian lineages for ZIKV (Faye et al.,
2014) and placed ZIKV MEX_I_7 within the Asian lineage, segre-
gating closest to Guatemalan isolates from the American
pandemic.
A Screen for Anti-ZIKV Activity among FDA-Approved
Drugs Identifies Several Candidates for Drug
Repurposing
Flaviviruses require a large number of human host factors, and
many of these are targets of approved drugs. An expeditious
path to identify candidate anti-ZIKV therapeutics is to repurpose
previously approved drugs. To this end, we screened a library
of 774 FDA-approved therapeutics for anti-ZIKV activity (Fig-
ure 1A). Human HuH-7 cell monolayers were treated with each
drug in the library, a positive control anti-flaviviral compound
(NITD008) (Yin et al., 2009) or vehicle (DMSO) for 1 hr before
infection with ZIKV MEX_I_7 (see Experimental Procedures).
The following day, cells were fixed, and the viral envelope protein
was labeled for immunofluorescent detection. Automated imag-
ing and analysis quantified cell number and the percentage of
cells that were productively infected. This assay design should
effectively identify drugs that inhibit viral entry, translation, or
RNA synthesis, but may not identify drugs that target late stages
of infection such as viral egress. In negative control wells,
48.30% ± 4.63% of cells were infected compared to less than
1% of those treated with NITD008 (Figure 1B). The Z0 factor, a
quantitative metric that assesses screen robustness, for the
population of the 44 negative and 44 positive controls in the initial
screen was 0.7, a value interpreted as evidence of an excellent
assay (Zhang et al., 1999). We independently performed a repli-
cate screen using the same library and controls. The distribution
of the infection rates for the replicate screens was similar,
yielding a correlation coefficient of 0.86 (Figure 1C). The full data-
sets for the screens are in Table S1.
Most drugs showed little to no effect on either ZIKV infection
rate or number of cells detected (Figure 1D). The population
mean infection rate was 49.18% (95% CI: 48.32%–50.05%),
which is similar to the mean of the negative controls. Forty five
drugs significantly inhibited ZIKV infection (Z score % �3.00) in
both replicates of the screen. Some of these also reduced cell
number. The median cell count for the population in replicate 1
was 3,085, which was similar to the average cell count for the
DMSO control wells (2,866 ± 275). Replicate two performed
similarly (Table S1). We concluded that our screen was able to
differentiate candidate antiviral compounds from the distribution
of the population.
Of the 45 drugs that reduced virus infection, we selected 30
based on their efficacy in our system and considerations of their
clinical use (these 30 are indicated by red circles in Figure 1D;
highlighted in Table S1). The percent infection within the 30
selected hits ranged from uninfected to 28.07% and cell number
ranged from 3 to 3,905 cells, with a median 1,868 cells. In gen-
eral, there were fewer cells in wells treated with these 30 drugs
compared to the average of the negative control. Therefore,
toxicity by candidate antivirals may impact results at the concen-
tration tested (10 mM). Nevertheless, hits including daptomycin,
mycophenolate mofetil, and sertraline reduced viral infection
without affecting cell count (Figure 1E). Using a low-passage,
pandemic-associated ZIKV virus isolate, this screen systemati-
cally evaluated FDA-approved therapeutics to identify ZIKV
infection inhibitors. Furthermore, the results show that drugs
that are approved for use during pregnancy are among those
that block ZIKV MEX_I_7 in our assay.
Follow-Up and Validation of Selected Anti-ZIKV Drugs
We selected the aforementioned 30 drugs (red circles, Figure 1D)
for follow-up analysis based primarily on their efficacy in
reducing ZIKV infection in primary screens. Each drug was
used to pre-treat HuH-7 cells at concentrations of 0.001 mM,
260
Cell Host & Microbe 20, 259–270, August 10, 2016
 0.01 mM, 0.1 mM, 1 mM, and 10 mM, for 1 hr prior to infection with
ZIKV. For comparison, we used NITD008 and vehicle as positive
and negative controls, respectively. After 24 hr of infection, cells
were fixed, stained for viral antigen, and analyzed for percent
infection and cell number. As expected, most drugs displayed
clear antiviral activity at 10 mM concentrations (Figure S2), in
agreement with the primary screen data. Six drugs, which
reduced percent infection values by less than half or only elimi-
nated cells, were excluded from further testing, leaving a list of
24 drugs with validated anti-ZIKV activity (Table S1).
The reduction of infection rate was highly correlated with
reduction of cell numbers for multiple drugs, indicating that these
compounds target processes essential for both cell survival/pro-
liferation and ZIKV replication. This profile was exemplified by the
antineoplastic proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Figure 2). This
was expected since HuH-7 cells are derived from a human hep-
atoma and are susceptible to antineoplastic drugs. Several drugs
reduced infection rates without large effects on cell number.

Infection among FDA-Approved Drugs

centration of drugs was 10 mM.

(E) Representative images showing viral antigen
(red) and nuclei (blue) for controls and selected

tive. Data for the screen are presented in Table S1.
Among the most potent of these were
ivermectin, mycophenolic acid (MPA),
and daptomycin (Figure 2). The latter
two drugs showed EC50 values of be-
tween 0.1 and 1.0 mM, while the EC50 for
ivermectin was between 1 and 10 mM. Of
note, bortezomib (Choy et al., 2015),
ivermectin (Mastrangelo et al., 2012;
Wagstaff et al., 2012), and MPA (Diamond
et al., 2002) have been shown to inhibit
replication of flaviviruses, whereas dapto-
mycin has not been previously associated
with antiviral activity. Other notable drugs
that reduced infection without strongly
reducing cell numbers were sertraline-
HCl, pyrimethamine, palonosetron-HCl,
and cyclosporine A (Figure S2). Only the
latter has been previously documented
to inhibit flavivirus infection (Qing et al.,
2009). Given their anti-ZIKV activity and
their clinical profile, the drugs listed on Table 1 could be consid-
ered for treatment of high-risk Zika patients.
Flaviviruses require hundreds of pro-viral host factors for effi-
cient replication (Krishnan et al., 2008; Le Sommer et al., 2012;
Sessions et al., 2009), and it is possible that some of the
anti-ZIKV drugs target these factors. We explored this idea by
comparing the gene targets of the 24 drugs to human gene prod-
ucts identified in RNAi screens for YFV and DENV host factors in
HuH-7 cells (Le Sommer et al., 2012) (N.J. Barrows, unpublished
data). Interestingly, four out of the 24 validated drug targets have
been identified previously as host genes affecting YFV or DENV
propagation, respectively, in these RNAi screens (Table S2).
Drugs Inhibit ZIKV MEX_I_7 Infectivity in Human Cell
Lines Derived from Genital, Placental, and Neural
Tissues
Given the evidence for sexual transmission, possibly through in-
fected semen coming in contact with vaginal mucosa or cervix,
Cell Host & Microbe 20, 259–270, August 10, 2016
261
 and the clear evidence of placental infection (Mlakar et al., 2016;
Noronha et al., 2016), we also studied established cell lines
derived from the genital tract and trophoblasts. Both HeLa cells,
which were derived from a cervical adenocarcinoma, and JEG3
cells, which were derived from a placental choriocarcinoma,
were readily infected with ZIKV MEX_I_7 (Figure 3). We selected
eight drugs for follow-up testing in HeLa and JEG3 cells:
ivermectin, daptomycin, MPA, sertraline, pyrimethamine, cyclo-
sporine A, azathioprine, and mefloquine. In HeLa cells, all drugs
tested reduced virus infection rate at 10 mM concentrations (Fig-
ure S3A). 1 mM MPA completely inhibited infection in HeLa cells,
as did 10 mM ivermectin (Figures 3A and 3C). Daptomycin was
not as potent of an inhibitor in HeLa compared to HuH-7 but still
reduced infection significantly. In JEG3 cells, four out of eight
drugs tested showed antiviral effects, and MPA was the most
potent (Figures 3B, 3C, and S3B), reducing infection at 1 and
10 mM. An unusually strong reduction of JEG3 cell count after
treatment of 10 mM ivermectin was observed in some experi-
ments, while treating HeLa cells with 10 mM ivermectin did not
show the same impact on cell count. These experiments show
that the inhibitory capacity of several FDA-approved drugs was
not strictly cell line specific and importantly could be seen in cells
types that may be relevant to ZIKV infection.
The dramatic effect of Zika on fetal neural development (Pe-
tersen et al., 2016) and strong evidence that neural progenitor
or stem cells and neurons can be infected by ZIKV (Garcez
et al., 2016; Hanners et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016; Tang et al.,
2016) led us to investigate the effect of several drugs on ZIKV
MEX_I_7 infection of a human fetal brain-derived neural stem
cell (hNSC) cell line (K048), which was obtained without genetic
modifications (Svendsen et al., 1998). These were infected much
less efficiently by ZIKV MEX_I_7 than HuH-7, HeLa, or JEG3
cells, with infection rates of �8% using an MOI of 3 (Figure 4).
We tested the effects of selected drugs at 1 and 10 mM on infec-
tion. Cells were pre-treated with drugs and then infected for 96 hr
before analysis by flow cytometry for viral antigen positivity. At
concentrations of 1 mM, only NITD008 and MPA reduced rates
of virus infection of hNSCs (Figure 4A). Unexpectedly, cyclo-
sporine A enhanced infection at 1 mM compared to the DMSO
control. In contrast, at 10 mM concentrations, NITD008, MPA,
cyclosporine A, and ivermectin each significantly blocked ZIKV
MEX_I_7 infection (Figure 4B). It should be noted, however,
that at 10 mM concentrations, ivermectin, mefloquine, and to a
lesser extent cyclosporine A altered cellular light scattering fea-
tures, which suggests cell toxicity, and reduced the number of
cells that could be confidently analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig-
ures 4C, 4D, and S4). We additionally tested a ZIKV strain from
the African lineage (ZIKV DAK_41525) (Ladner et al., 2016) on
hNSCs with a drug panel including sertraline and bortezomib.
At 1 mM concentrations, MPA, ivermectin and bortezomib all ex-
erted antiviral effects, and only the latter exhibited moderate
toxicity (Figures 4E and 4F).
Drugs Inhibit ZIKV MEX_I_7 Infectivity in Primary Human
Amnion Epithelial Cells
Primary human amnion epithelial cells (HAECs) form the lining of
the amniotic sac. These cells were efficiently infected in vitro by
ZIKV MEX_I_7 and thus represent a primary cell line amenable to
our screening model. We tested ivermectin, daptomycin, MPA,
sertraline, pyrimethamine, cyclosporine A, azathioprine, and
mefloquine, using a concentration range with a higher maximum
(16 mM). At 16 mM, none of these drugs caused substantial
reduction of cell numbers (Figure S5A). In contrast, we observed
moderate inhibition of ZIKV MEX_I_7 infectivity by daptomycin
and strong inhibition by ivermectin, sertraline, and mefloquine
at 16 mM (Figures 5A and 5B). MPA inhibited ZIKV MEX_I_7 infec-
tion at 1.6 mM (Figure 5B). We tested these drugs on HAECs from
another donor and observed similar antiviral effects for MPA,
ivermectin, daptomycin, mefloquine, and sertraline (data not
shown). These results confirmed that potential anti-ZIKV thera-
peutics are effective in primary human fetal cells. These data
extend the range of the anti-ZIKV activity to cells believed to

 be attacked by the virus in vivo and suggest that combinations of
well-tolerated drugs should be considered for clinical use to opti-
mize effectiveness in different organs and cell types.
DISCUSSION
Here we identified FDA-approved drugs that can inhibit ZIKV
infection in several human cells, including those of genitourinary
and neural origin (Table 2), and suggest that these drugs be
carefully considered for expedited trials among Zika patients. It
is important to point out that given their safety profiles, many
of these drugs have been used during pregnancy for other indi-
cations, both in the US as well as globally. Some are FDA cate-
gory B, meaning that ‘‘animal reproduction studies have failed to
demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and
well-controlled studies in pregnant women OR Animal studies

FDA Pregnancy Categories are defined as follows (modified from https://www.drugs.com/):
Category A: Adequate and well-controlled studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy (and there is no
evidence of risk in later trimesters).
Category B: Animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in preg-
nant women.
Category C: Animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus, and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans,
but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks.
Category D: There is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in
humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks.
It should be noted that effective 30 June 2015 the FDA published the Content and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological
Products; Requirements for Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling, ‘‘Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule’’ (PLLR or final rule). The PLLR removes
pregnancy letter categories from drug labels, however, these categories remain useful as general guidelines for clinicians and investigators.

 have shown an adverse effect, but adequate and well-controlled
studies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to
the fetus in any trimester.’’ Even those that are category C or D
(risk not ruled out or positive evidence of risk, respectively) can
be used in pregnancy when potential benefit outweighs the
risk, which is likely in the case of Zika. For example, sertraline
(Zoloft) is one of the better studied and most used anti-depres-
sants in pregnancy even though it is category C. We should
also keep in mind that the use of these medications to treat
Zika infection during pregnancy may require shorter courses
and may involve gestational age windows that are different,
and therefore better safety profile, than what is used for the
currently accepted indications. In addition, many of these drugs
have been shown to cross the placenta (e.g., mefloquine, sertra-
line), allowing the opportunity to treat not only the mother but
also the fetus. Furthermore, where data support lack of negative
drug-drug interactions, clinical studies could test combinations
of two or more of these to achieve maximal efficacy.
It is critically important to note that many of the drugs shown to
have anti-ZIKV activity could have untoward effects, particularly
in the context of pregnancy, and therefore their use should be
only in the hands of clinical experts, preferably under research
protocols. The use of these drugs in a clinical setting will obvi-
ously rely on the best diagnostic evidence, and every effort
should be made to use the most sensitive and specific tests to
optimize the accuracy of a Zika diagnosis. Like any treatment

 in pregnancy, the risks of the treatment and the potential for
overtreatment have to be weighed against the risk of no treat-
ment, in this case a devastating neurodevelopmental adverse
outcome.
Several of the drugs have been previously shown to have
antiviral activity. For example, MPA has been demonstrated to
inhibit DENV (Diamond et al., 2002; Kang et al., 2014; Ng et al.,
2007; Takhampunya et al., 2006), and our observation that it
also inhibited ZIKV provides evidence that our screen success-
fully identified established flavivirus inhibitors. Ivermectin had
previously been shown to inhibit Venezuelan equine encephalitis
virus (Lundberg et al., 2013), chikungunya virus (Varghese et al.,
2016), and several flaviviruses (Mastrangelo et al., 2012) (Lund-
berg et al., 2013). Daptomycin, however, had not been
previously shown to have antiviral activity. Daptomycin is a lipo-
peptide antibiotic that inserts into cell membranes rich in phos-
phatidylglycerol (PG) (Baltz, 2009), and this suggests an effect
on PG-rich late endosomal membranes, which are critical for
viral entry (Zaitseva et al., 2010). The identification of daptomycin
as potentially useful to treat Zika patients highlights the power of
unbiased screens. Therefore, while we wholeheartedly agree
with Ekins et al. (2016) in calling for an open drug discovery for
ZIKV antivirals, we do not favor the priority these authors give
to screening known antivirals.
The hits reported herein are FDA-approved therapeutics for a
variety of diseases, and the pharmacokinetics have been re-
ported for some of these drugs. For example, the maximum
plasma concentrations (Cmax) for high-dose daptomycin were
reported to exceed 180 mg/mL, and the duration to achieve
Cmax (tmax) was within the first 30 min of intravenous delivery
(Benvenuto et al., 2006). In addition, Cmax for MPA was between
24.2 and 47.2 mg/L an hour after drug delivery (Bullingham et al.,
1998). In each case, the effective experimental concentrations
reported here were below the Cmax reported in the literature,
and tmax was achieved within an hour of drug delivery. Ivermectin
inhibited the African lineage ZIKV infection at 1 mM in our hNSC
model. The ivermectin Cmax has been reported to be 260 ng/mL
(Guzzo et al., 2002), so the effective concentration we report is
43 higher than the observed Cmax. Mefloquine inhibited ZIKV
infection at 10 mM. The mefloquine Cmax has been reported as
1,872 ng/L (Karbwang and White, 1990). Therefore, the concen-
tration for mefloquine that resulted in antiviral activity in vitro
was approximately 2.23 higher than the potential Cmax. For iver-
mectin and mefloquine, tmax was less than 5 or 24 hr, respec-
tively (Guzzo et al., 2002; Karbwang and White, 1990). Although
it is difficult to extrapolate from in vitro models to in vivo activity, it
is promising that our preclinical testing discovered anti-ZIKV
activity for several drugs within a range reasonably achievable
in humans.
It should also be noted that the information derived from our
screen can shed light on the biology of ZIKV, and re-analysis
of our data will likely lead to identification of pathways critically
important to the virus (Table 2). Indeed, the potent antiviral action
of bortezomib (Figures 2 and 4), which had been noted for activ-
ity against DENV (Choy et al., 2015), indicates that proteasome
action is essential for ZIKV. The role of iron metabolism in the
ZIKV life cycle, highlighted by sensitivity to deferasirox (Fig-
ure S2), may be of interest for future exploration. Interestingly,

 we observed that YFV infection wassensitive to knockdownof the
iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme (ISCU), suggesting a shared
requirement between diverse flaviviruses (Le Sommer et al.,
2012). ZIKV is also sensitive to perturbation of neurotransmitter
signaling, as evidenced by the inhibitory effects of sertraline and
palonosetron (Figures 5 and S2). Here again we observed consis-
tency with our prior data that identified cellular genes HTRC3 and
GRK2 as important YFV HDFs (Le Sommer et al., 2012). Although
not the primary target of our screen, compounds that enhanced
infection were also identified, and these may provide insights
into host pathways that restrict infection or those that when acti-
vated make cells most suitable for viral replication. Importantly,
we note that desogestrel was one of the drugs that enhanced
infection. Although other progestins in the chemical library did
not cause similar effects, this observation may have implications
for pregnant women and those on hormonal contraception.
Confronted with the large and growing Zika pandemic, we
have few options to intervene. Insecticide-based vector control
methods (Arau
´ jo et al., 2015; Benelli, 2015) complemented by
more sophisticated approaches, such as release of genetically
modified (Moreira et al., 2009) or Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes
(Harriset al.,2012),haveshownpromise toreducemosquitopop-
ulations, but even if successful, these campaigns take months if
not years to implement. Furthermore, ZIKV sexual transmission
presents a problem not dealt with by vector control alone. The sit-
uation in terms of treatment or prevention is not much better.
While there are several approaches being considered, there is
no available vaccine for ZIKV, and it may take years for final
approval. The antiviral approach is equally limited: there are
very few approved drugs to treat acute viral infections, and there
are no approved anti-flavivirals (Mene
´ ndez-Arias and Richman,
2014). It is critical to pursue strategies, similar to those effective
against human immunodeficiency and hepatitis C viruses, that
hold promise for infections caused by the related DENV and
WNV (e.g., direct acting antivirals) (Kok, 2016); however, these
anti-flaviviral compounds are in early phases of development
and may take years to move into clinical use. The work presented
here provides therapeutic possibilities to consider and test when
confronted with ZIKV infection in pregnancy and in individuals
with increased risk due to underlying medical conditions. More-
over, this work highlights how little we know about the molecular
vulnerabilities of emerging pathogens and the importance of

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell Culture
Vero,HuH-7,andHeLacellsweremaintainedinDMEMsupplementedwith10%
FBS and penicillin and streptomycin (P/S). JEG3 cells were maintained in MEM
supplemented with 10% FBS and P/S. C6/36 cell line was maintained in RPMI
supplemented with 10% FBS and P/S. Human fetal brain neural stem cells
(K048) were originally derived from the cortical region of a 9-week post-mortem
fetus and grown as suspending neurosphere cultures. They were maintained in
serum-free medium (DMEM/F12 3:1) supplemented with B27, 20 ng/ml fibro-
blast growth factor 2, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 10 ng/ml leuke-
mia inhibitory factor, and P/S (Wu et al., 2002). Primary HAECs were amplified in
DMEM:F12 (1:1) supplemented with 10 mg/L EGF, 10% FBS, and P/S.
Primary Human Amnion Cell Cultures
Fetal membrane tissues were obtained after placental delivery from women
undergoing elective repeat cesarean section and uncomplicated pregnancies
at term, not in labor at the John Sealy Hospital at UTMB, TX, USA. The IRB
approval for discarded tissues was obtained prior to sample collection.
Fetal membranes were dissected, and the amnion layer was peeled from cho-
riodecidua, washed in warm saline, and small pieces (0.5 cm2) were digested
twice with trypsin (1 mg/mL) and collagenase (0.5 mg/mL) for 30 min at 37�C.
The digestion buffer was inactivated by DMEM complete media ([DMEM/F12
(Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 15% FBS (Sigma-
Aldrich) and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin]), and
the cells were collected by centrifugation. Cells were counted with a hemocy-
tometer, and seeded in 10-cm culture plates with DMEM complete media, at
37�C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The purity of the epithe-
lial cells was greater than 95%, as determined by staining with cytokeratin
antibodies (Pan-Cytokeratin, Abcam, #ab80826).
Virus Culture
ZIKV MEX_I_7/2015 (Genbank: KX247632) was amplified once in Vero cells
followed by three passages in C6/36 cells. Zika virus/A.africanus-tc/SEN/
1984/41525-DAK (ZIKV DAK_41525) stocks were generated on Vero cells.
Virus containing media was collected in RPMI supplemented with 5% FBS,
P/S and 0.01 M HEPES (pH 7.4). The virus containing material was cleared
by centrifugation at 1,000 3 g for 20 min at 4�C and stored at �80�C.

 Drug Library Screening
2 3 104 HuH-7 cells were seeded onto collagen-coated (Sigma # C8919) Ther-
moNunc 96-well, black wall, optical bottom microwell plates (#165305) using
DMEM (GIBCO #11995-065) media supplemented with 10% FBS (OmegaSci
#FB-12) and P/S (GIBCO #15140-122). Cells were pretreated with experimental
compound (Enzo #BML-2843-0100 SCREEN-WELL FDA-Approved Drug
Library V2) or controls; diluted to a final concentration of 13.8 mM in DMEM,
5% FBS, P/S, 0.01 M HEPES (GIBCO #15630-080); and incubated 1 hr
at 37�C. Approximately 1 hr after addition of compounds, 55 ml of ZIKV
MEX_1_7 diluted 1 in 125 using DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, P/S,
and 0.01M HEPES, was added to each well, resulting in a 10 mM final concen-
tration for each compound. The calculated virus of 8,718 FFU, or MOI 0.4, was
added to each well. The infected cells were incubated 24–26 hr post-infection.
Infection was stopped by rinsing each well once with PBS with calcium and
magnesium. (Stock # Corning # 21-030-CV) and fixing the cells with 4% para-
formaldehyde (PFA). Cells were permeabilized using PBS with 0.1% Triton
X-100 and blocked using 1% Normal Goat Serum in PBS with 0.1% Tween20.
Primary antibody, 4G2 (pan-flavivirus, anti-envelope antibody) (Henchal et al.,
1982) was diluted in 1% normal goat serum in PBS with 0.1% Tween and incu-
bated on cells overnight at 4�C. Secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse
Alexa647, and the nuclear stain, Hoechst was applied the following day. Both
antibody stocks and Hoechst were diluted 1:2,000 in 1% Normal Goat Serum
in PBS with 0.1% Tween20. One field per well was imaged using the 103 objec-
tive on a PerkinElmer Opera Phenix High Content Screening System and the
images were analyzed using the associated Harmony� Office Software.
Compound Validation Studies
Essentially the same protocol as in the primary screens was used, with the
exception that the compounds were serially diluted to achieve final concentra-
tions of 10 mM, 1 mM, 0.1 mM, 0.01 mM, and 0.001 mM. For HeLa and JEG3
infections, twice as much virus (MOI of 0.8) was used compared to HuH-7 infec-
tions. HuH-7, HeLa and JEG3 validation experiments were performed twice
with at least three replicates per condition. hNSC experiments were performed
at least once withat least three replicates per condition. For hNSC experiments,
cells were infected at an MOI of 3 for 48 or 96 hr with ZIKV DAK_41525 or ZIKV
MEX_I_7, respectively. Cells were then harvested, fixed in 13 PBS buffer con-
taining 4% PFA and incubated with the primary antibody anti-envelope 4G2
diluted 1:1,000 in permeabilizing/blocking solution (13 PBS, 0.1% saponin
and 1% BSA) overnight. After two washes with the permeabilizing/blocking so-
lution, cells were incubated for 1 hr with goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 and
analyzed in a Guava� easyCyte flow cytometer. Collected data were analyzed
with the FlowJo v.10 software. The criteria for determining whether cells were
analyzed were based on light scattering features for the negative controls.
Drug Validation Using HAECs
Two experiments (A and B, respectively) were performed using cells from two
different donors. In both experiments, 1.5 3 104 HAEC cells were seeded in
DMEM: F12, 5% FBS, P/S, EGF onto collagen coated microwell plates. All
subsequent chemical or viral dilutions were performed using the same media.
Compounds were serially diluted such that cells were pretreated for 1 hr at
37�C with experimental compounds or controls, diluted to a final concentration
between 0.00288 and 28.8 mM or between 0.00138 and 13.8 mM for experi-
ments A and B, respectively. Approximately 1 hr after addition of compounds,
55 ml of ZIKV MEX_1_7 diluted 1 in 62.5 was added to each well, resulting in a
final concentration between 0.0016 and 16 mM or between 0.001 and 10 mM for
experiments A and B, respectively. The calculated virus of 1.8 3 104 FFU, or
MOI 1.2, was added to each well for both experiments. The infected cells
were incubated 24–26 hr post-infection. Infection was stopped by rinsing
each well once with PBS with calcium and magnesium and fixing the cells
with 4% PFA. The cells were stained consistent with HuH-7, HeLa and JEG3
experiments. Nine fields per well were imaged using a 103 objective and
analyzed as described for the other experiments.
