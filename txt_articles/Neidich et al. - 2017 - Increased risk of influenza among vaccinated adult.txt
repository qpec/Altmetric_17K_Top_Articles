Abstract
Background—Influenza infects 5–15% of the global population each year, and obesity has been 
shown to be an independent risk factor for increased influenza-related complications including 
hospitalization and death. However, the risk of developing influenza or ILI in a vaccinated obese 
adult population has not been addressed.
Objective—This study evaluated whether obesity was associated with increased risk of influenza 
and influenza-like illness among vaccinated adults.
Subjects and Methods—During the 2013–2014 and 2014–2015 influenza seasons, we 
recruited 1042 subjects to a prospective observational study of trivalent inactivated influenza 
vaccine (IIV3) in adults.1022 subjects completed the study. Assessments of relative risk for 
laboratory confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness were determined based on BMI. 
Seroconversion and seroprotection rates were determined using pre-vaccination and 26–35 days 
post-vaccination serum samples. Recruitment criteria for this study were adults 18 years of age 
and older receiving the seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) for the years 2013–
2014 and 2014–2015. Exclusion criteria were immunosuppressive diseases, use of 
immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive drugs, acute febrile illness, history of Guillain-Barre 
syndrome, use of theophylline preparations, or use of warfarin.

 Results—Among obese, 9.8% had either confirmed influenza or influenza-like-illness compared 
with 5.1% of healthy weight participants. Compared with vaccinated healthy weight, obese 
participants had double the risk of developing influenza or influenza-like illness (relative risk= 
2.01, 95% CI 1.12, 3.60, p=0.020). Seroconversion or seroprotection rates were not different 
between healthy weight and obese adults with influenza or ILI.
Conclusions—Despite robust serological responses, vaccinated obese adults are twice as likely 
to develop influenza and influenza-like illness compared to healthy weight adults. This finding 
challenges the current standard for correlates of protection, suggesting use of antibody titers to 
determine vaccine effectiveness in an obese population may provide misleading information.
INTRODUCTION
Influenza is a serious worldwide public health problem. Seasonally, 5–10% of adults and 
20–30% of children contract influenza virus, resulting in up to 500,000 deaths1 and 
influenza pandemics greatly increase the number of infections and deaths. Indeed, the 1918 
influenza pandemic was estimated to have infected 20–40% of the world’s population, 
causing approximately 50 million deaths2. Historically, the highest risk groups for increased 
morbidity and mortality from influenza infection include the elderly3, the very young4, 
individuals with chronic diseases such as diabetes5 or congestive heart failure6, and pregnant 
women7. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, obesity was recognized as an independent risk 
factor for complications from influenza8 and continues to be a risk factor for seasonal 
influenza strains9 as well as for emerging influenza virus strains such as A(H7N9)(ref. 10). 
Obesity is not only a concern in the US, with 37% of adults obese11, but also affects 14% of 
the worldwide adult population12. Therefore, with a growing obesity epidemic, 
complications from influenza infection would be expected to increase.
Influenza vaccine remains the primary method currently available for prevention of 
influenza infection. Each year, vaccines are formulated based on evaluations of previously 
circulating influenza strains. Typically, the vaccine contains two influenza A strains and one, 
or more recently two, influenza B strains. Vaccine-generated antibodies against the viral 
surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) are considered to be protective, therefore vaccines are 
standardized to the quantity of HA, generally 15 μg of HA per strain13. A serum 
hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titer of 40 or greater has historically been considered an 
immunological correlate of protection from influenza infection, corresponding to 50% 
protection14. Protection against influenza infection increases up to an HAI titer of 160, 
beyond which further protective capacity is minimal15. High risk groups for influenza 
infection, including the elderly and children under 6 years of age, may need to reach titers 
greater than 40 to achieve protection16. To determine if obesity altered the risk of developing 
influenza or ILI in a vaccinated adult population, we report the incidence of influenza 
infection and influenza-like illness (ILI) in vaccinated obese and healthy weight adults as 
well as the extent to which participants with influenza infection and ILI produced influenza 
specific antibodies.

 SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Study Design
Participants were recruited as a part of a prospective observational study carried out at the 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Family Medicine Center, an academic outpatient 
primary care facility in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. All procedures were approved by the 
Biomedical Institutional Review Board at the University of North Carolina. At enrollment, 
informed written consent was received.
Participants
Recruitment criteria for this study were adults 18 years of age and older receiving the 
seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) for the years 2013–2014 and 2014–
2015. Exclusion criteria were immunosuppressive diseases including HIV, use of 
immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive drugs, acute febrile illness, history of 
hypersensitivity to any influenza vaccine components, history of Guillain-Barre syndrome, 
use of theophylline preparations, or use of warfarin. Height and weight were measured and a 
baseline serum sample drawn. BMI for each participant was calculated as weight (kg)/
height(m)2. Healthy weight was defined as a BMI of 18.5–24.9, overweight as a BMI of 25–
29.9 and obese as a BMI of ≥30.
Vaccines and Sample Collection
One dose of 2013–2014 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (0.5 mL Fluzone; Sanofi 
Pasteur, Swiftwater PA, USA) containing A/California/07/2009 H1N1, A/Texas/50/2012 
H3N2, and B/Massachusetts/02/2012 or 2014–2015 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine 
(0.5 mL Fluvirin; Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics Limited, Basel, Switzerland) 
containing A/California/07/2009 H1N1, A/Texas/50/2012 H3N2, and B/Massachusetts/
02/2012 was administered in the deltoid muscle, using an inch and half needle, at baseline. 
Participants returned 26–35 days later for a post-vaccination blood draw. In the 2013–2014 
vaccine year, vaccination of participants started on September 16, 2013 and the last 
vaccination was given on November 4, 2013. Influenza was first detected in NC on 
November 30, 2013, and cases peaked on January 11, 2014, with influenza levels back to 
baseline on May 17, 2014. In the 2014–2015 vaccine year, vaccination of participants started 
on September 15, 2014 and were completed on October 28, 2014. Influenza was first 
detected in NC on November 29, 2014 and cases peaked on December 27, 2014. Influenza 
levels were back to baseline on April 25, 2015. Serum samples were stored at −80° C until 
analyzed. During the 2013–2014 season in North Carolina, influenza 2009 A/H1/N1 was the 
predominant circulating strain, and during the 2014–2015 season, influenza A/H3N2/
Switzerland was the predominant circulating strain.
Surveillance and diagnosis of influenza and/or influenza-like illness (ILI)
Participants were contacted weekly beginning with the first report of influenza activity in the 
community and contact was discontinued when influenza was no longer active. Participants 
were contacted by phone or email and asked to report any symptoms of fever, cough, runny 
nose, sore throat, muscle aches, headaches and fatigue to assess for influenza symptoms.

 Medical records of all study participants, whether they reported ILI or not, were reviewed at 
the end of each season for medically reported influenza-like illness or laboratory confirmed 
influenza. Participants were also instructed to contact the study nurse if they developed ILI. 
Laboratory confirmed influenza infection was determined from the medical records which 
reported a positive influenza specimen using the FDA cleared Cepheid Xpert Flu assay 
(Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). This assay distinguishes between influenza A and influenza B 
strains, but does not subtype the strains. All participants who tested positive for influenza 
were diagnosed with influenza A. ILI was defined using the CDC guidelines17 as fever 
greater than 100° F with a cough and in the absence of any other medical diagnosis. All 
subjects with laboratory confirmed influenza also met our criteria for ILI.
Immunogenicity
Hemaglutination Inhibition (HAI) Assay—The HAI titer was blindly determined in 
accordance with World Health Organization guidelines18 for all patients reporting laboratory 
confirmed influenza or ILI, as well as matched non-illness reporting participants.
Microneutralization (MN) Assay—Standard microneutralizations (MN) were blindly 
performed against cell-grown A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2) according to WHO guidelines18. 
Luminescent MN assays were blindly performed as previously described using a reverse 
genetics A/California/04/2009 (pdmH1N1) virus containing an NLuc on its polymerase 
segment19. MN were conducted for participants with laboratory confirmed influenza and 
matched controls who did not report any ILI during influenza season.
Matched non-illness reporting participants—For every participant who either had 
laboratory confirmed influenza or reported ILI, we matched them with a non-illness 
reporting participant. Matching of the non-illness reporting participants was done on a one-
to-one basis with the 74 participants with either confirmed influenza or reporting ILI based 
on the following criteria in the order provided: 1) same vaccine year; 2) sex; 3) Race; 4) 
weight category; 5) diabetes status; 6) statin use; 7) smoking status; 8) age (within 10 years). 
All samples were uniquely matched.
Statistics
Individuals were categorized as underweight (BMI < 18.5), healthy weight (BMI 18.5 – 
24.9), overweight (BMI 25.0 – 29.9), or obese (BMI ≥ 30). The Jonckheere–Terpstra test 
was employed to assess associations between baseline covariates and the ordinal weight 
category. Risk ratios for laboratory confirmed influenza and influenza-like Illness (ILI) were 
estimated by fitting a log-binomial model using generalized estimating equations (GEE) 
with an exchangeable working correlation structure to account for repeated observations per 
individual. Logistic regression models fit using GEE were utilized to examine associations 
of diabetes and statin use with obesity and risk of influenza/ILI. Microneutralization and 
HAI results were analyzed via 2-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for comparisons between matched pairs. Seroconversion 
and seroprotection were analyzed by the chi-square test of independence. P-values less than 
0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data presented in tables were analyzed using 
R20. Data presented in Figure 1 were analyzed using Graphpad Prism 6.0h for Mac OSX.

 RESULTS
Demographics of Participants
During the 2013–2014 vaccine year, we enrolled 587 participants and 575 (98.0%) 
completed the study. During the 2014–2015 vaccine year, we enrolled 455 participants and 
447 (98.2%) completed the study. As shown in Table 1, overall, our participants were 27% 
healthy weight, 28% overweight and 44% obese. In both years of the study, approximately 
60% of the participants were Caucasian and 30% African-American. Female participants 
represented approximately 63% of the total participants. As has been reported for other 
studies, African-Americans21, and diabetics22 were more likely to be obese, and statin use 
was associated with higher BMIs. However, statin use and diabetes was not independently 
associated with influenza or influenza-like illness. Most of the participants were either non-
smokers, or had never smoked, with approximately 17% current smokers. There were 184 
study subjects who participated in both years of the study, fifteen of which reported ILI in 
one or both years of the study.
Relative Risk for Influenza and ILI
In the total vaccinated adult participants for both vaccine years, there were 10 laboratory 
confirmed cases of influenza A and 64 cases of ILI (Table 2). Of the 74 participants with 
either confirmed influenza or ILI, 19% were healthy weight, 22% were overweight and 59% 
were obese. Relative to influenza incidence in vaccinated healthy weight adults, vaccinated 
obese adults had double the risk for laboratory confirmed influenza considered together with 
ILI (estimated risk ratio 2.06 with 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14, 3.71). The risk ratio 
estimate was similar when adjusting for vaccine year, age, sex, and smoking status using 
log-binomial regression (2.01, 95% CI 1.12, 3.60). Diabetes and statin use were not 
associated with influenza or influenza-like illness, however, as expected, BMI category was 
a significant predictor of diabetes and statin use.
Seroprotection and Seroconversion
Among the 74 cases of confirmed influenza or ILI during 2013–2014 and 2014–2015, 30 
(41%) seroconverted (four-fold increase from pre- to post-vaccination HAI titer) to vaccine 
strain A/H1N1/California/pdm2009 and 34 (46%) seroconverted to vaccine strain A/H3N2/
Texas/50/2012. For these same 74 participants, 70% reached a seroprotective titer (26–35 
day post vaccination HAI titer ≥ 40) for A/H1N1/California/pdm2009 and 80% reached a 
seroprotective titer for A/H3N2/Texas/50/2012. However, no differences were observed in 
seroprotective or seroconversion rates based on BMI (Table 3 and Figures 1a–b).
During the 2014–2015 influenza season, the H3N2 vaccine strain was a poor match for the 
circulating strain23. Therefore, for the 43 cases of laboratory confirmed influenza or ILI 
during 2014–2015, we measured HAI titers pre and post vaccination against the circulating 
influenza A/H3N2/Switzerland/9715293/2013 strain. Seroconversion for this strain occurred 
in 19 (44%) participants, and seroprotection was present in 30 (70%) participants. Again, no 
differences were observed based on BMI (Table 3 and Figures 1c). Higher, alternative 
cutoffs for seroprotection levels of HAIs at 80, 160 and 320 were also determined, and no 
differences were observed based on BMI (Table 3).

 Laboratory confirmed Influenza and ILI compared to non-illness reporting matched 
controls
All 74 participants with either laboratory confirmed or ILI were matched with non-illness 
reporting participants and their demographics are shown in Supplemental Table 1. There 
were no differences in pre or post HAI titers for the vaccine strains A/California/H1N1/
pdm2009 (Figure 1d) and A/Texas/H3N2/50/2012 (Figure 1e) or for the circulating 2015 
influenza strain A/H3N2/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (Figure 1f) between participants 
reporting ILI and their non-reporting matched controls. Similarly, there was no difference in 
HAI (Figures 1g–h) or MN influenza titers (Figures 1 j-k) between participants with 
laboratory confirmed influenza and their matched, uninfected controls.
DISCUSSION
The first influenza pandemic of the 21st century resulted in identifying obesity as an 
independent risk factor for increased severity from infection with Influenza A/
pH1H1/20098. Since that time, obesity has also been identified as a risk factor for seasonal 
and emerging influenza strains. This is highly significant, in that obesity levels in the US 
population are at epidemic proportions, with 37% of adults overall obese11 and even higher 
rates in non-Hispanic blacks (48%)21. Obesity rates worldwide have doubled since 1980 and 
currently 13% of the world’s adult population is obese12, leaving a large number of obese 
adults in the US and worldwide at significant risk for infection with influenza virus.
Influenza vaccination represents the best method of protection from infection with influenza 
virus. Several studies have suggested that overweight and obesity impairs vaccine response 
to several pathogens. For example, non-responders to hepatitis B vaccination are 
overrepresented in obese adults24, while tetanus toxoid response in overweight children is 
similarly impaired25. A recent review on the association of obesity with vaccine responses 
points to a number of studies that demonstrate diminished vaccine-induced immune 
responses in both obese adults and children26. We have also documented impaired vaccine-
specific T cell responses in influenza vaccinated obese adults27, and a waning serological 
response one year post vaccination28. Despite the growing number of studies implicating 
obesity in poor responses to vaccination, and specifically influenza vaccination, a key 
question remains unanswered: in obesity and healthy weight, does vaccination offer the 
same protection from influenza and ILI?
Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that obese adult recipients of IIV3 have two times 
greater incidence of influenza and/or ILI despite being vaccinated. One obvious hypothesis 
for the increase in influenza and ILI in obese adult participants is a failure to seroconvert or 
reach seroprotective levels of antibody. Serological responses to influenza vaccination are 
typically assessed as seroprotection, defined as an HAI titer of 40 or greater post 
vaccination, or seroconversion, defined as a 4 fold or greater increase in HAI from 
prevaccination titer to post vaccination titer. However, we found that the increased 
susceptibility to influenza and ILI in the obese adults was not associated with a failure to 
reach a seroprotective titer or to seroconvert. Indeed, we found no statistical differences in 
serological responses to vaccine between healthy weight and obese vaccinated adults. For 
the H1N1 strain, 36% of healthy weight adults seroconverted compared with 43% of obese

 adults. Similarly, seroconversion rates to the H3N2 vaccine strain were 43% of healthy 
weight adults and 50% of obese adults. When using the commonly defined seroprotective 
HAI titer of ≥40, more than 70% of the healthy weight and obese participants reached this 
HAI level.
The presence of a “seroprotective” level of antibody against influenza A strains 
demonstrates that, despite the vaccine inducing this this correlate of protection, the obese 
adults were still 2X more likely to develop influenza and ILI. This lack of protection, even 
with a seroprotective antibody titer, has also been observed in elderly adults29 and 
children16, where a higher HAI definition as a correlate of protection has been proposed. 
Our data, however, do not suggest an elevated definition is protective for obese adults. 
Raising the seroprotective cutoff level to 80, 160 and 320 still failed to differentiate healthy 
weight adults from obese adults.
The 2014–2015 influenza vaccine effectiveness overall was reduced (13% vs 61% in 2013–
2014) due to the circulating Influenza A H3N2 strain having drifted from the H3N2 vaccine 
strain23. Therefore, for all participants who had influenza or ILI during the 2014–2015 
vaccine season, we measured HAI antibody titer against the circulating A/Switzerland/
9715293/2013 strain. Despite the mismatch with the vaccine strain, IIV3 induced 
seroconversion among 67% of the healthy weight and 32% of the obese participants. For a 
seroprotective level of ≥40 HAI, 67% of healthy weight and 60% of obese participants 
achieved this level. There were no statistical differences in seroprotection or seroconversion 
rates between healthy weight and obese adults.
We found no differences in HAI titers between non-illness reporting participants and 
participants reporting ILI. In addition to HAI, virus microneutralization (MN) titers are a 
highly sensitive and specific method for detecting antibodies that inhibit viral entry or exit 
out of the cell. Cheng et al.30 reported that, compared to HAI titers, MN titers demonstrated 
a greater seroconversion rate and fold increase and suggested that neutralizing antibody 
titers may be a better correlate of protection for understanding influenza vaccine 
effectiveness. However, as was found for HAI titers, there were no differences in MN titers 
between uninfected controls and infected participants.
Our study has several limitations. Although we used the CDC’s stringent definition for ILI 
and ILI is widely used for influenza surveillance reporting, we did not do specific testing for 
influenza in subjects with ILI. Therefore we could be over-reporting, as some of the ILI 
subjects may be positive for a respiratory virus other than influenza, or under-reporting, as 
the more stringent CDC criteria may miss some milder ILI symptoms that are influenza 
positive. By only collecting ILI data during times of influenza circulating in the community, 
this helps to reduce over-reporting, but it doesn’t eliminate this possibility. In addition, our 
study does not address the possibility that obese adults may be more exposed to influenza 
compared with healthy weight adults. Under this possibility, the influenza vaccine may 
equally protect healthy weight and obese adults, however an increased rate of infection 
exposure in obese adults could lead to an increased rate of infection in vaccinated obese 
adults compared with healthy weight adults. However, Murphy et al.31 used data from the 
2010 Health Survey for England, which asked in a survey question administered during the

 year following the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic whether participants had experienced 
“flu-like illness where [respondents] felt feverish and had a cough or sore throat,” and 
considered cases between May and December 2009 to be flu-like illness in that study. The 
investigators found no relationship between ILI (including laboratory confirmed influenza) 
and obesity. This finding may suggest that influenza infection rates in healthy weight and 
obese adults are similar, and therefore our findings are related to a failure of the vaccine to 
protect obese adults to the same extent as healthy weight adults. Indeed, in an animal model, 
Karlsson et al.32 reported that although lean mice were protected from influenza infection 
following vaccination, diet-induced obese mice were still susceptible to influenza infection 
despite vaccination. This contrasts with school aged children, where live attenuated 
influenza vaccination was shown to reduce risk for laboratory confirmed influenza similarly 
for healthy weight and obese33. These contrasting findings may be driven by differences in 
vaccine preparation (live versus inactivated), or by differences between obese adults and 
children.
The findings reported here demonstrate that, compared to vaccinated healthy weight adults, 
vaccinated obese adults were 2X more likely to develop influenza infection and ILI. 
Notably, HAI antibody titers, widely viewed as correlates of protection against influenza, 
were unreliable as predictive of disease protection in obese adults. Previously, we28 and 
others34–36 have reported that HAI antibody titers 30 days post vaccination in obese adults 
or children are either slightly higher or no different from vaccinated healthy weight 
individuals. The present study confirmed these earlier reports on vaccine-induced antibody 
titers. However, here we found that an HAI antibody titer of 40 or higher was not a 
serological correlate for vaccine-induced protection and did not prevent laboratory 
confirmed influenza and ILI in obese adults. Additionally, MN titers in obese adults were 
also inadequate predictors of protection and these studies directly correlate with studies 
conducted in obese mice32. Although our study does not compare vaccinated obese adults 
with unvaccinated obese adults, it is clear that vaccinated obese adults are at a higher risk for 
influenza and ILI compared to vaccinated healthy weight adults.
The mechanism for increased risk of influenza and ILI in the obese population may be due 
to poor T cell function. As we have reported previously, compared with T cells from 
vaccinated healthy weight adults, T cells from influenza vaccinated obese adults are less 
activated when stimulated with vaccine strains of influenza26,27. As T cells are necessary for 
protection and recovery from influenza, impaired T cell function, despite a robust 
serological response, may render vaccinated obese adults more susceptible to influenza 
infection. Indeed, vaccinated elderly adults are also less protected from influenza infection 
despite having an adequate serological response, which has been attributed to poor T cell 
responses29.
Taken together, these results suggest that the effectiveness of influenza vaccines, and 
perhaps other vaccines as well, should be fully assessed in obese adults. For example, use of 
adjuvanted influenza vaccines such as MF59 (FLUAD, Seqirus) or high-dose vaccine 
preparations that are designed for vaccinating adults over 65 may be warranted for use in an 
obese population. However, animal studies suggest that even adjuvanted vaccines or 
increased dosage may not overcome the increased susceptibility of the obese host32.

 Therefore, alternative approaches may be needed to protect obese adults from both seasonal 
and pandemic influenza virus infection.

aAge is reported in years +/− SD
bThe p-values are shown for an overall test of association between the covariate and the weight category using the Jonckheere-Terpstra test. As previously reported and also found here, prediabetes, type 2 
diabetes and statin use is associated with weight, and overweight/obesity is present at a higher rate in African-Americans21 and females are frequently more at risk for influenza infection than males37.
All other values reported as number of participants within each weight class with the indicated demographic.

aRisk ratio estimates are for laboratory confirmed influenza and influenza-like Illness (ILI) combined. Estimates were obtained using a log-binomial model fit using generalized estimating equations (GEE) 
with an exchangeable working correlation structure to account for repeated observations per individual. The model was adjusted for vaccine year, age, sex and smoking. Underweight and healthy weight 
individuals were combined into a single referent category due to the small number of underweight individuals.
bCI: confidence interval.

aSeroconversion is defined as a ≥4-fold increase in HAI titer 25–35 days post vaccination from pre-vaccination titer.
bSeroprotection is typically defined as an HAI of ≥40, however multiple cut-off points were assessed as indicated. There were no significant associations between weight and the odds of seroconversion for 
the multiple cut-off points considered.
cN is number of subjects by column and varies by virus as A/H3N2/Switzerland/9715293 was not assessed in participants from the 2013–2014 influenza vaccine season.
