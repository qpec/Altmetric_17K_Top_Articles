Summary
Background— Lyme borreliosis is the most common tick-borne disease in the northern 
hemisphere. It is a multisystem disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies and 
characterised by tissue localisation and low spirochaetaemia. In this study we aimed to describe a 
novel Borrelia species causing Lyme borreliosis in the USA.
Methods—At the Mayo clinic, from 2003 to 2014, we tested routine clinical diagnostic 
specimens from patients in the USA with PCR targeting the oppA1 gene of B burgdorferi sensu 
lato. We identified positive specimens with an atypical PCR result (melting temperature outside of 
the expected range) by sequencing, microscopy, or culture. We collected Ixodes scapularis ticks 
from regions of suspected patient tick exposure and tested them by oppA1 PCR.
Findings—100 545 specimens were submitted by physicians for routine PCR from Jan 1, 2003 
to Sept 30, 2014. From these samples, six clinical specimens (five blood, one synovial fluid)

 yielded an atypical oppA1 PCR product, but no atypical results were detected before 2012. Five of 
the six patients with atypical PCR results had presented with fever, four had diffuse or focal rash, 
three had symptoms suggestive of neurological inclusion, and two were admitted to hospital. The 
sixth patient presented with knee pain and swelling. Motile spirochaetes were seen in blood 
samples from one patient and cultured from blood samples from two patients. Among the five 
blood specimens, the median oppA1 copy number was 180 times higher than that in 13 specimens 
that tested positive for B burgdorferi sensu stricto during the same time period. Multigene 
sequencing identified the spirochaete as a novel B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies. This same 
genospecies was detected in ticks collected at a probable patient exposure site.
Interpretation—We describe a new pathogenic Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies 
(candidatus Borrelia mayonii) in the upper midwestern USA, which causes Lyme borreliosis with 
unusually high spirochaetaemia. Clinicians should be aware of this new B burgdorferi sensu lato 
genospecies, its distinct clinical features, and the usefulness of oppA1 PCR for diagnosis.
Introduction
Lyme borreliosis is a spirochaetal tick-borne disease caused by some genospecies of the 
Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex.1–4 With 85 000 cases estimated annually in Europe 
and 300 000 cases estimated annually in the USA, it is the most common tick-borne disease 
in the northern hemi sphere.5,6 Nearly all human infections are caused by three B 
burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies: Borrelia garinii, Borrelia afzelii, and B burgdorferi sensu 
stricto.1 All three species cause Lyme borreliosis in Europe, whereas only B burgdorferi 
sensu stricto causes Lyme borreliosis in the USA.7
The clinical features of Lyme borreliosis are broad and seem to be associated with distinct 
tissue tropisms of specific B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies.8 Early localised infection 
typically results in erythema migrans rash, after which spirochaetes can disseminate to the 
nervous system, joints, and other organs. B burgdorferi sensu stricto is often associated with 
arthritis, B garinii with neurological effects, and B afzelii with acrodermatitis chronicum 
atrophicans.8
Lyme borreliosis is characterised by a low level of spirochaetaemia.9 Spirochaetes are 
detectable by PCR in the peripheral blood of less than 50% of patients with erythema 
migrans, with average estimation of about 2330 genome copies per mL,9,10 whereas the 
mean number of spirochaetes detected by culture of peripheral blood is only 0·1 spirochaetes 
per mL.9 As expected, microscopic detection of B burgdorferi sensu lato spirochaetes has 
never been reported in peripheral blood, by marked contrast with relapsing fever borreliae, 
which have loads ranging from 105 spirochaetes per mL to more than 106 spirochaetes per 
mL, and are readily seen in peripheral blood.11 We describe a new B burgdorferi sensu lato 
genospecies causing Lyme borreliosis with substantially elevated spirochaetaemia in acutely 
ill patients.

 Methods
Patients
Mayo Medical Laboratories provides diagnostic PCR testing for Lyme borreliosis.12 From 
Nov 1, 2003, to Sept 30, 2014, physicians throughout the USA submitted 100 545 
specimens (synovial fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, EDTA [edetic acid]-anticoagulated whole 
blood, or fresh tissue) to our laboratory for routine clinical PCR testing. We interviewed 
patients with specimens yielding a PCR result that differed from that expected for B 
burgdorferi sensu stricto, B garinii, or B afzelii, to obtain clinical and epidemiological 
information. We reviewed medical records and requested additional samples. Patient follow-
up and DNA sequencing of clinical specimens was approved by the Mayo Clinic 
institutional review board. Patients were interviewed by state public health officials as part 
of routine surveillance for a reportable condition.
Real-time PCR and DNA sequencing
We extracted DNA from diagnostic specimens using the MagNA Pure Instrument (Roche) 
and tested for B burgdorferi sensu stricto, B afzelii, and B garinii with a diagnostic real-time 
PCR assay that uses hybridisation probes and targets the chromosomal oppA1 gene.12,13 
This assay is specific for B burgdorferi sensu lato and does not detect relapsing fever 
borreliae. We subjected PCR products to melting temperature analysis to differentiate B 
burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies (appendix). We established the number of oppA1 copies 
with standard curves that were prepared with genomic DNA from B burgdorferi sensu stricto 
B31 and the MN14-1420 isolate; oppA1 is present on the chromosome in a single copy in 
both genospecies. We used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (two-sided) for oppA1 PCR crossing 
point comparison.
We amplified and sequenced portions of the 16S rDNA, ospC, flaB, rrf-rrl, oppA1, uvrA, 
rplB, recG, pyrG, pepX, clpX, nifS, and clpA genes using previously described 
primers.12,14–17 We analysed, assembled, and trimmed sequences in Lasergene v9·0 
(DNASTAR). Using BLAST, 16S rDNA, ospC, flaB, and rrf-rrl sequences were compared 
with B burgdorferi sensu lato and relapsing fever borreliae sequences in GenBank. For 
construction of phylogenetic trees, we obtained homologous B burgdorferi sensu lato and 
relapsing fever borreliae sequences from GenBank and PubMLST (appendix). We used 
MEGA 5 (ClustalW) to align sequences and trees constructed by maximum likelihood 
analysis using the generalised time-reversible nucleotide substitution model with gamma 
distribution (four categories) followed by bootstrap analysis (1000 replicates).18 
Housekeeping genes were concatenated in frame in the order uvrA, rplB, recG, pyrG, pepX, 
clpX, and clpA, with or without nifS and exported into MEGA 5 to calculate pairwise 
genetic distances using the Kimura-2 model.
Microscopy and culture
Two clinical blood specimens with an atypical oppA1 PCR melting temperature were 
available for microscopy and culture after storage at 4°C for either 5 days (one sample) or 39 
days (one sample) (appendix). Other specimens were unavailable or previously frozen and

 not amenable to microscopy and culture. We examined wet mounts from patient samples and 
cultures with dark-field microscopy at 400 times magnification (appendix).
Serological testing
We tested serum samples and plasma samples for antibodies reacting to B burgdorferi sensu 
stricto using FDA-cleared commercially available kits, following the recommended two-
tiered algorithm (appendix).19
Tick collection and processing
We collected Ixodes scapularis ticks at approximate sites of possible patient exposure in 
Barron County, WI, USA, during 2013 and 2014 (appendix), and processed the ticks for 
PCR using a modification of a published protocol.20 We also tested archived DNA from I 
scapularis collected in Eau Claire County, WI, USA, during 2009–10.

Results
From Jan 1, 2012, to Sept 30, 2014, 9197 clinical specimens from residents of Minnesota, 
Wisconsin, and North Dakota were submitted to Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA, for 
routine diagnostic B burgdorferi sensu lato oppA1 PCR testing. 3127 (34%) of 9197 
specimens tested were blood samples, 1196 (13%) were synovial fluid, 4782 (52%) were 
cerebrospinal fluid, and 92 (1%) were tissue. 102 specimens were positive for B burgdorferi, 
including 13 blood, 81 synovial fluid, three cerebrospinal fluid, and five tissue samples. Six 
specimens (five blood, one synovial fluid) had positive oppA1 PCR results with an atypical 
melting temperature (60·38–61·24°C), falling between the expected melting temperature for 
B burgdorferi sensu stricto (61·7–66·7°C) and B afzelii or B garinii (51·7–56·7°C) (table 1, 
figure 1A, figure 2, appendix).12 No atypical melting temperatures were identified among 24 
786 clinical specimens tested from 44 other states during the same time period (Fisher-
Exact, p=0·00039), or among more than 66 562 clinical specimens from all states tested by 
the same method during 2003–11 (0 of 66 562 vs six of 33 983, p=0·00149). The five 
positive blood specimens with atypical melting temperatures were collected 1–4 days after 
onset of illness; the synovial fluid specimen was obtained 34 days after onset of illness 
(table 1). The median oppA1 PCR crossing point was significantly lower (median 29·82, 
IQR 28·89–30·75) for the five blood specimens with atypical oppA1 melting temperature 
compared with the 13 blood specimens that tested positive for B burgdorferi sensu stricto 
(median 34·51, IQR 33·73–35·55; p=0·0016; figure 3).
Sequence analysis of the atypical oppA1 PCR products that were directly amplified from 
three patient specimens identified a Borrelia species with 89–95% similarity to B 
burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies (figure 4). Motile spirochaetes (two per 70 fields of

 diluted blood) of the B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies were microscopically recorded in 
blood from patient 6, obtained 1 day after illness onset and analysed 6 days later (figure 1B). 
The number of spirochaetes was estimated at around 8·5 × 104/mL (appendix). No 
spirochaetes were seen in the haemolysed blood specimen from patient 5. Cultures of the B 
burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies (MN14-1420 and MN14-1539) were established from 
both available blood specimens (patients 5 and 6) after incubation for about 16 days. 
Spirochaetes were seen in primary and blind passaged cultures; sustained growth was 
achieved after cryopreservation and additional passage.
Based on the high quantity of spirochaetes that were detected microscopically, we estimated 
the number of oppA1 copies per mL of blood for all 18 specimens that tested positive for 
oppA1 PCR identified in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and North Dakota during 2012–14 by 
comparison of oppA1 crossing point values to standard curves prepared with B burgdorferi 
sensu stricto B31 or MN14-1420 (appendix). For the five atypical oppA1 positives, the 
median oppA1 copy number was 180 times higher (median 8·1 × 105, IQR 4·6 × 105–3·6 × 
106) when compared with the 13 B burgdorferi sensu stricto positives (median 4·5 × 103, 
IQR 2·3 × 103–7·5 × 103; figure 3).
Sequence analysis of 16S rRNA (1327 nucleotides), ospC (561 base pairs), flaB (435 base 
pairs), and rrf-rrl (253 base pairs) amplified from the two blood isolates substantiated that 
the Borrelia species was not identical to any other Borrelia species in GenBank (appendix). 
The closest sequence identity was to B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies at 99% for 16S 
RNA, 85% for ospC, 97% for flaB, and 95% for rrf-rrl. Multilocus sequence analysis of 
seven genes, uvrA, rplB, recG, pyrG, pepX, clpX, and clpA genes (3774 nucleotides), 
showed that the spirochaetes isolated from patients 5 and 6 fell within the B burgdorferi 
sensu lato genospecies complex and were the same B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies 
amplified from the blood of patients 1, 2, and 3. The blood isolates were further compared 
with 18 B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies and three relapsing fever borreliae using an 
eight-gene multilocus sequence analysis (uvrA, rplB, recG, pyrG, pepX, clpX, clpA, and 
nifS; 4335 nucleotides) previously described for defining B burgdorferi sensu lato 
genospecies21 (figure 4B). The highest pairwise similarity was to B burgdorferi sensu stricto 
(94·9–95·2% similarity, genetic distance 0·051–0·048), well above the threshold defined for 
separating genospecies (98·3% similarity, genetic distance 0·017),21 substantiating that the 
organism detected in the six patients is a novel B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies, and not 
a relapsing fever borrelia (eg, B miyamotoi). For comparison, the genetic distance recorded 
between the novel B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies and B burgdorferi sensu stricto B31/
Z41293 is greater than that seen between other formally recognised B burgdorferi sensu lato 
genospecies, including B bissetti and B kurtenbachii (0·035) and B garinii and B bavariensis 
(0·018).14,21
All patients were residents of the upper midwest (Minnesota, North Dakota, or Wisconsin) 
(figure 5). Median patient age was 36 years (range 10–67 years); four patients were male 
(table 1). Five presented with acute febrile illnesses, including four with rash. The sixth 
patient was afebrile but had a 1-month history of unilateral knee pain and swelling. Two 
patients were admitted to hospital, but none had a known immunocompromising disorder. 
Testing showed lymphopenia (four of five tested), mild thrombocytopenia (two of five), and

 high hepatic transaminases (two of three). All patients reported onset of illness between May 
and July. Exposure to tick habitats in Minnesota or Wisconsin was reported by all patients 
and two recalled a tick bite less than 30 days before onset of illness. For one patient, the 
timing between tick bite and PCR sample acquisition was known to be 13 days.
Descriptions of illness-associated rash varied from diffuse macular rashes involving the face, 
trunk, and upper extremities (figure 1A, patients 1 and 5) to a single 2 cm diameter 
erythematous leg lesion at the tick bite location (patient 6; table 1). Patient 3 presented with 
a single annular erythematous leg lesion with central punctum consistent with erythema 
migrans, and developed fever, leg and arm pain, and diffuse macular rash on the trunk, upper 
and lower extremities, and face within 8 h of receiving doxycycline. Differential diagnosis 
included Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, drug eruption, and erythema multiforme. 
Doxycycline was discontinued after one dose. The patient improved without additional 
treatment, but 3 weeks later developed three erythema migrans lesions on the back and leg, 
which resolved after treatment with cefuroxime.
All six patients were given antibiotics (table 1). All five patients with febrile illnesses 
recovered; one with preexisting anaemia reported continuing fatigue. The patient with 
arthritis improved but reported persistent joint pain 6 months after treatment. Serum or 
plasma was available for five patients and was tested for reactivity to B burgdorferi sensu 
stricto antigens using the recommended two–tiered algorithm19 (table 2). Patients 1, 3, and 4 
were seropositive to B burgdorferi sensu stricto using this algorithm, including the 30 day 
cutoff for use of IgM immunoblot. Patient 5 had a positive EIA and IgM immunoblot in a 
sample obtained 32 days after onset of illness. All four seropositive patients had one or more 
samples positive using the first-tier C6 EIA; patients 3, 4, and 5 were positive using whole 
cell EIA. Two seropositive patients (3 and 5) had serial samples and sero converted from a 
negative to positive IgM immunoblot. The only specimen from patient 6 was obtained 1 day 
after illness onset and was seronegative.
Among archived and prospectively collected ticks I scapularis, 19 (2·9%, range 0–5·2%) of 
658 were oppA1 PCR positive for the novel B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies and 195 
(29·6%, range 9·8–33·3%) of 658 were positive for B burgdorferi sensu stricto; two were 
positive for both. Sequence analysis of oppA1 for two ticks (EC10N1 and CP12150) and 
seven-gene multilocus sequence analysis for one tick (EC10N1) substantiated that the B 
burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies detected in I scapularis was the same identified in 
patients (figure 4A, appendix).
Discussion
We have identified a new B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies (candidatus Borrelia 
mayonii) among patients and I scapularis ticks from the upper midwestern USA. A causal 
role in the patients’ illnesses was suggested by the detection of DNA from this genospecies 
in patient specimens during acute illness, detection of motile spirochaetes in one blood 
specimen, culture of the novel B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies from two patient 
specimens, development of a patient antibody response after illness onset, and clinical 
improvement after antimicrobial therapy active against other B burgdorferi sensu lato

 genospecies. Failure to identify the organism in more than 90 000 clinical samples tested in 
previous years and from other states might suggest that this new species recently emerged in 
the upper midwestern USA.
Using an eight-gene multilocus sequence analysis and a published threshold for delineation 
of B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies, we showed that the Borrelia species is a member of 
the B burgdorferi sensu lato group.
Spirochaetes were seen in the diluted blood of a patient who presented with a single 
erythema migrans lesion, estimated by microscopy at 105 genome copies per mL. The 
number of genomes in this specimen, based on the single-copy chromosomal gene oppA1, 
was estimated independently at 5 × 105 per mL. Importantly, the median oppA1 copy 
number measured for the samples positive for B burgdorferi sensu stricto (4·5 × 102 per mL) 
agrees with that (2·3 × 102/mL) recorded previously using quantitative flaB PCR, thus 
supporting the use of the oppA1 gene for B burgdorferi sensu lato quantitation.10 For all five 
blood specimens from patients infected with the novel B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies, 
the number of genomes was estimated to be 105–106 genome copies per mL. This number is 
similar to what has been reported for patients infected with relapsing fever borreliae and 50–
8000 times higher than the blood specimens that tested positive for B burgdorferi sensu 
stricto during the same time period. The number of spirochaetes as estimated by both 
microscopy and PCR in blood from patients infected with the novel B burgdorferi sensu lato 
genospecies is greater than previously estimated for Borrelia miyamotoi (103–104 
spirochaetes per mL of blood), a relapsing fever borreliae reported to cause human illness in 
the USA, Europe, and Russia.22–25 Whether this high spirochaetaemia suggests a different 
tissue tropism for the new B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies is an important question that 
needs to be further addressed; five of six novel B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies PCR 
positives were blood specimens, whereas only 13 (13%) of the 102 B burgdorferi sensu 
stricto PCR positives detected during the same time period were blood, and 81 (79%) of 102 
samples were synovial fluids.
Patients infected with the novel B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies presented with 
differing clinical presentations when compared with patients infected with B burgdorferi 
sensu stricto. At least two patients presented with diffuse macular rash not typical of 
erythema migrans, including one rash that might have involved the palms and soles. Four 
patients presented with nausea or vomiting and two with fever over 39°C, symptoms not 
usually reported for Lyme borreliosis7,26–28 but often reported among patients infected with 
relapsing fever borreliae.29 Similarly, three patients had symptoms potentially consistent 
with neurological effects (confused speech, profound somnolence, visual difficulties) and 
two were admitted to hospital.
An important issue raised by identification of the novel B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies 
is whether existing Lyme borreliosis diagnostic tests can detect infection with this organism. 
The six patients described here were fortuitously detected during routine clinical testing, 
because the diagnostic oppA1 PCR used at Mayo Clinic detects and differentiates B 
burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies by melting temperature analysis. However, it is unknown 
if diagnostic PCR assays specific for B burgdorferi sensu stricto will detect the novel

 genospecies. Regarding serology, the B burgdorferi sensu stricto C6 EIA was positive in all 
four patients with specimens obtained 3 days or more after onset of illness and B burgdorferi 
sensu stricto IgM immunoblots of specimens obtained 6 to 32 days after onset were positive 
for three patients. The B burgdorferi sensu stricto IgG immunoblot, however, was positive 
only for the patient with more than 30 days of untreated illness. B burgdorferi sensu stricto 
serology was negative for three specimens drawn 1–3 days after onset of illness.
The patients’ infections were probably acquired by the bite of I scapularis, which transmits 
B burgdorferi sensu stricto in the USA. Two patients recalled a tick bite before illness and I 
scapularis that tested positive for the new B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies were 
collected at two Wisconsin locations, including one visited by two patients. Prevalence of 
the novel species in tested I scapularis ranged from 0·6–4·9%. Non-detection of the new B 
burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies in I scapularis collected in the midwestern USA during 
2004–07 further suggests that it might have recently emerged in this region.30,31
The identification of a novel B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies causing Lyme borreliosis 
with substantially elevated spirochaetaemia and clinical features distinct from other 
recognised B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies has important implications for accurate 
diagnosis, treatment and disease reporting. In view of the differing clinical manifestations 
for patients infected with the novel B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies, it is likely that 
Lyme borreliosis is not being considered—and therefore not diagnosed—in some patients 
with this infection. The clinical range of illness must be better defined in additional patients 
to ensure that physicians can recognise the infection and distinguish it from other tick-borne 
infections. Many tick-borne pathogens have global distribution, therefore studies are needed 
to establish the geographic distribution of human beings and ticks infected with the novel B 
burgdorferi sensu lato genopecies. Finally, clinicians should be aware of the potential role of 
oppA1 PCR for diagnosing infection with this novel pathogen.

 Research in context
Evidence before this study
Lyme borreliosis is a multisystem tick-borne disease of wide public health significance. It 
is the most frequently reported vector-borne disease in the temperate northern hemisphere 
and is caused by spirochaetes in the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies complex. 
There have been no previous descriptions of the pathogenic Borrelia species reported in 
this study in either ticks or human beings, or reports of Lyme borreliosis with high 
spirochaetaemia.
Added value of this study
The identification of a new B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies causing Lyme 
borreliosis with substantially elevated spirochaetaemia and clinical features distinct from 
other B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies has important implications for accurate 
diagnosis and treatment. In view of the differing clinical manifestations for patients 
infected with the novel B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies, it is likely that Lyme 
borreliosis is not being considered in some patients with this infection. The medical and 
health-care community need to be aware of this new pathogen to recognise the infection 
and to treat patients appropriately.
Implications of all the available evidence
The discovery of a novel B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies was attributable to the use 
of a diagnostic real-time PCR assay that detects and differentiates B burgdorferi sensu 
lato genospecies by melting temperature analysis. Those PCR assays designed 
specifically for detection of a single B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies do not have the 
same ability to identify new or different genospecies. Since many tick-borne human 
pathogens have a global distribution (eg, B burgdorferi, Babesia microti, Anaplasma 
phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia muris, and Borrelia miyamotoi), the emergence of this 
pathogen highlights the need for widespread surveillance to look for emergence of this 
organism or related species in other parts of the world.

relapsing fever species. Bootstrap support values greater than 50% are shown. The scale bar 
corresponds to 0·1 substitutions per nucleotide position. The source of other Borrelia species 
gene sequences is shown in the supplemental methods. Sequence nomenclature (eg, 
MN14-1539, WI133) represents the state from which the diagnostic specimens were

 Figure 5. Probable counties of patient exposure to ticks in Minnesota and Wisconsin in relation 
to risk of diseases transmitted by I scapularis
I scapularis-transmitted diseases in the figure were Lyme borreliosis, babesiosis, and 
anaplasmosis. The county of residence for each patient (indicated with a circle) is deemed a 
county of potential exposure except for the patient from North Dakota, whose county of 
residence is not shown. Some patients had probable exposures in one or more county in 
addition to their county of residence (indicated with a triangle). The risk of disease 
transmitted by I scapularis is based on county-specific mean annual reported incidence of 
confirmed Lyme borreliosis and confirmed and probable human anaplasmosis and babesiosis

people were classified as low risk, counties with 10·1–24·9 cases per 100 000 people were 
classified as moderate risk, and counties with 25·0 or more cases per 100 000 people were
