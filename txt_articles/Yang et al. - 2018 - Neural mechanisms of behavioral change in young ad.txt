Measuring treatment efficacy in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) relies primarily on behaviors, with
limited evidence as to the neural mechanisms underlying these behavioral gains. This pilot study addresses this void
by investigating neural and behavioral changes in a Phase I trial in young adults with high-functioning ASD who
received an evidence-based behavioral intervention, Virtual Reality-Social Cognition Training over 5 weeks for a total
of 10 hr. The participants were tested pre- and post-training with a validated biological/social versus scrambled/non-
social motion neuroimaging task, previously shown to activate regions within the social brain networks. Three signifi-
cant brain-behavior changes were identified. First, the right posterior superior temporal sulcus, a hub for socio-
cognitive processing, showed increased brain activation to social versus nonsocial stimuli in individuals with greater
gains on a theory-of-mind measure. Second, the left inferior frontal gyrus, a region for socio-emotional processing,
tracked individual gains in emotion recognition with decreased activation to social versus nonsocial stimuli. Finally,
the left superior parietal lobule, a region for visual attention, showed significantly decreased activation to nonsocial
versus social stimuli across all participants, where heightened attention to nonsocial contingencies has been consid-
ered a disabling aspect of ASD. This study provides, albeit preliminary, some of the first evidence of the harnessable
neuroplasticity in adults with ASD through an age-appropriate intervention in brain regions tightly linked to social
abilities. This pilot trial motivates future efforts to develop and test social interventions to improve behaviors and
supporting brain networks in adults with ASD. Autism Res 2018, 11: 713–725. V

Lay Summary This study addresses how the behavioral changes after treatment for ASD reflect underlying brain changes.
Before and after receiving VR-SCT, young adults with high-functioning ASD passively viewed biological motion stimuli in
a MRI scanner, tapping changes in the social brain network. The results reveal neuroplasticity in this age population,
extending the window of opportunity for interventions to impact social competency in adults with ASD.

Introduction
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmen-
tal disorder characterized by challenges with social
skills, speech and nonverbal communication, and repet-
itive behaviors [APA, 2013]. While the bulk of the work
in ASD treatment has focused on early childhood, a
critical stage that is believed to represent the most
opportune time for treatment of social deficits to be
achievable, treatment research in adults with ASD is
much more limited [Howlin & Moss, 2012]. Moreover,
evaluation of ASD treatment typically relies on behav-
iors, including externally observable behaviors (e.g., eye
contact) and internal behaviors (e.g., self-report of emo-
tional and cognitive processes), leaving explanations
elusive as to whether and how behavioral improve-
ments reflect brain changes.
Neural markers associated with behavioral changes are
particularly
important
because
they
serve
to
better
inform our understanding of treatment mechanisms.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been
shown to be effective in revealing group differences

 between patients with ASD and healthy controls [Alli-
son, Puce, & McCarthy, 2000; Anagnostou & Taylor,
2011; Carrington & Bailey, 2009; Harms, Martin, & Wal-
lace, 2010; Kaiser et al., 2010, 2015 McKay et al., 2012;
Yang, Rosenblau, Keifer, & Pelphrey, 2015]. Recently,
fMRI has been further employed to understand the neu-
ral mechanisms of treatment in young children with
ASD [Venkataraman et al., 2016; Ventola et al., 2015;
Voos et al., 2012]. However, fMRI has not been applied
to identify neural mechanisms of treatment effects in
adults with ASD. There is an urgent need to do so, as
intervention research and its effectiveness is limited
beyond the age of adolescence in ASD [Bishop-Fitzpa-
trick, Minshew, & Eack, 2013; Brugha, Doos, Tempier,
Einfeld, & Howlin, 2015; Hedley et al., 2016; Walton &
Ingersoll, 2013]. Moreover, conventional wisdom holds
that the social deficits of ASD are difficult to near impos-
sible to treat after childhood, although this stance
remains relatively untested. Such a view has likely served
to limit research initiatives focused on treatment for
adults with autism [Blackwell, Trzesniewski, & Dweck,
2007]. The present study represents a preliminary effort
to fill this void by examining whether young adults with
high functioning ASD can benefit from age-appropriate
social training as manifested on brain and behavioral
changes. We were particularly interested in measuring
pre- to post-training changes in brain regions previously
linked to social skills and on related social measures. We
compared before and after treatment the mean brain
activation at a group level and whether there was a con-
vergence between brain changes and improved social
abilities to support changes at an individual level.
The fMRI measure used in this study is a well-
validated social perception, biological motion fMRI task
[Kaiser et al., 2010], which robustly engages the neural
circuits supporting both socio-emotional and socio-
cognitive components of social information processing.
The biological motion videos feature an adult engaging
in children’s games and social actions (e.g., waving,
pat-a-cake). Prior research has shown that social orient-
ing
to
biological
motion
is
evolutionarily
well-
conserved and fundamental to adaptive social engage-
ment [Heberlein & Adolphs, 2004; Johnson, 2006; Sim-
ion, Regolin, & Bulf, 2008; Vallortigara, Regolin, &
Marconato, 2005; Yang et al., 2015]. With the contrast
of biological versus scrambled motion, the fMRI task
has revealed neural circuits of key social brain regions
implicated in core ASD deficits [Allison et al., 2000; Kai-
ser et al., 2010; McKay et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2015].
The regions include (a) key regions for socio-emotional
processing and emotion regulation [Etkin, Buchel, &
Gross, 2015; Kanske, Heissler, Schonfelder, Bongers, &
Wessa, 2011; Phelps & LeDoux, 2005]: the inferior fron-
tal gyrus (IFG)/ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC),
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and amygdala,
and (b) key regions for socio-cognitive processing and
social information integration [Deen, Koldewyn, Kanw-
isher, & Saxe, 2015; Saggar, Shelly, Lepage, Hoeft, &
Reiss, 2014; Yang et al., 2015]: the right posterior supe-
rior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and fusiform gyrus (FFG).
These findings provide possible regions of interest for
neuroplasticity in adults with ASD following social
training.
In addition, the fMRI task affords a novel contrast of
nonsocial versus social stimuli, which provides a win-
dow into the participants’ neural responses to nonsocial
stimuli. Previous research suggests that paying relatively
more visual attention to nonsocial contingencies is a
hallmark of autism [Klin, Lin, Gorrindo, Ramsay, &
Jones, 2009], which may help account for why they fail
to perceive social cues. We predicted that young adults
with ASD would show reduced visual attention to non-
social versus social stimuli, as one potential positive
outcome of the social intervention.
The treatment platform, Virtual Reality-Social Cogni-
tion Training (VR-SCT) [Kandalaft, Didehbani, Krawc-
zyk, Allen, & Chapman, 2013] was utilized in this
research, which is a short-term, 10-hr training, carried
out over a 5-week period. Virtual Reality (VR) in general
has been shown to be an effective tool in training social
skills for individuals with ASD [Bellani, Fornasari, Chit-
taro, & Brambilla, 2011; Kandalaft et al., 2013; Maskey,
Lowry, Rodgers, McConachie, & Parr, 2014; Parsons &
Mitchell, 2002; Wainer & Ingersoll, 2011]. Reviews on
VR studies suggest there are several advantages of using
VR environments to train social skills. Benefits include
the abilities to (a) simulate real-life experiences such as
commonly encountered challenges, (b) offer a safe,
repeatable, and controllable environment in which to
practice, (c) increase motivation to practice by levering

environment,
and
(d)
be
immersed
into
a
situation
to
experience
similarly
evoked real-life emotions related to the situation [Bel-
lani et al., 2011; Parsons & Mitchell, 2002]. The current
study followed the training platform in prior VR-SCT
studies
[Didehbani,
Allen,
Kandalaft,
Krawczyk,
&
Chapman, 2016; Kandalaft et al., 2013], comprehen-
sively targeting socio-emotional, socio-cognitive and
social functioning skills. Research findings from previ-
ous VR-SCT studies showed that training had a positive
impact on the ability to recognize emotions, under-
standing the intentions of others (theory of mind), and
improved daily social functioning conversation abilities
in both adults and children [Didehbani et al., 2016;
Kandalaft et al., 2013]. Due to the live and immersive
format of VR-SCT, participants engage in a real-time
flexible conversation with a coach and confederate con-
versation
partner
while
targeting
multiple
social-
cognitive strategies from one dynamic experience. In

 interactive platform for training and improving a wide
range of social abilities including socio-emotional and
socio-cognitive abilities for individuals with ASD.
In the current study, we investigated how therapeutic
response to VR-SCT reflect brain changes in young
adults with ASD. The biological motion fMRI task was
utilized because it taps into key neural circuits of socio-
emotional and socio-cognitive processing, which corre-
spond to the treatment targets of VR-SCT. Linking the
biological motion fMRI task and VR-SCT, we utilized
two separate behavioral tasks to measure behavioral
changes in both emotional and cognitive aspects of
social information processing. For the emotional com-
ponent, we measured behavioral changes in emotion-
recognition ability, whereas for the cognitive compo-
nent, we measured behavioral changes in theory-of-
mind ability. As VR-SCT has been demonstrated to
improve emotion recognition and theory of mind in
prior research [Didehbani et al., 2016; Kandalaft et al.,
2013], we expected that there would be similar behav-
ioral improvement on average (one-tailed). Moreover,
central to the aim of the current study, we hypothe-
sized that (a) brain regions linked to the social brain
networks would show pre to post changes in response
to the treatment at a group level across all participants,
and (b) improvement on behavioral measures of emo-
tion recognition and theory of mind would reflect
changes in corresponding key social brain regions at
the individual level, for socio-emotional processing and
emotion regulation [Etkin et al., 2015; Kanske et al.,
2011; Phelps & LeDoux, 2005] and for socio-cognitive
processing and social information integration [Deen
et al., 2015; Saggar et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2015],
respectively.
We acknowledge that parts of a larger data set used
in the current study, collected on the young adults
with high-functioning ASD, have been analyzed and
previously reported in our neuroprediction study [Yang
et al., 2017b]. However, it is important to point out
that the goals and analyses represent clear distinctions
between the previous study and the current study. First,
with respect to goals, the previous study addressed the
question: how informative fMRI is as a forecasting tool
to predict treatment response and facilitate subject
selection. In contrast, the current study addresses a dif-
ferent but equally important question: why VR-SCT
works on the brain level. Specifically, we wanted to elu-
cidate the neural mechanisms underlying the behav-
ioral
changes.
Second,
in
regard
to
analyses,
the
previous study examined the correlation between base-
line brain activities and behavioral changes from base-
line to endpoint, without examining any brain changes.
In contrast, the current study examined exclusively the
brain changes at the group level and the correlation
between brain changes and behavioral changes from
baseline to endpoint at the individual level. Thus, the
main
goals
and
analyses
of
the
two
studies
are
nonoverlapping.
Methods

recruited from two research sites: Yale Child Study Cen-
ter (YCSC) for 7 participants, and Center for Brain-
Health at The University of Texas at Dallas (CBH-UTD)
for the other 10 participants. IQ was measured using
the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI)
[Wechsler, 1999, 2011]. All participants met DSM-V
[APA, 2013] diagnostic criteria for ASD as determined
by the results of a gold-standard diagnostic instrument,
the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule [Gotham
et al., 2007; Hus & Lord, 2014; Lord et al., 2000]—
administered by research-reliable clinicians and licensed
clinical psychologists. Unfortunately, the ADOS subdo-
main scores were not available for two participants
because they were evaluated by psychologists involved
in other projects, although their autism diagnosis was
re-confirmed and current before they were included in
this project. Pretreatment clinical behavioral characteri-
zation was based on the self-reported Social Responsive-
ness Scale, 2nd edition (SRS-2) [Constantino, 2012] (M

SD 5 33.43),
which

social cognition, social communication, social motiva-
tion, and restricted interests and repetitive behavior.

Treatment Approach: Virtual Reality–Social Cognition
Training (VR-SCT)
VR-SCT has been shown to be an effective intervention
method for treating social deficits in both children and
young adults with ASD [Didehbani et al., 2016; Kanda-
laft et al., 2013]. Results from this current study were
expected to be similar to the outcomes from the prior
studies, including improved emotion recognition and
theory of mind after the 5-week, 10-hr training. During
the training session, both the clinician and participant
interacted entirely through virtual avatar characters (see
Fig. 1 for sample). Participants engaged in real-time,
nonscripted,
age-appropriate
scenarios

 interviewing, dating, or negotiating with a college-aged
friend while receiving real-time feedback from a coach
clinician. Participants were given multiple opportunities
within a session to practice a social skill within the
conversations. More details regarding the VR-SCT in
this study had been described in a previous report
[Yang et al., 2017b].
Primary Clinical Outcome: Changes in Emotion Recognition
and Theory of Mind
Treatment effectiveness was measured by behavioral
changes in two distinct domains of social abilities: emo-
tion recognition (tapping change in socio-emotional
processing
abilities)
and
theory
of
mind
(tapping
change
in
socio-cognitive
processing
abilities),
respectively.
Emotion recognition.
The Advanced Clinical Solutions
for WAIS-IV and WMS-IV Social Perception Subtest (ACS-
SP) [Kandalaft et al., 2012; Pearson, 2009], administered
by trained research staff in our research centers, was uti-
lized to measure emotion recognition abilities. Three
subscales are generated from the subtest tasks: (a) SP-
Affect Naming, a measure of face emotion recognition;
(b) SP-Prosody, a measure of vocal affect recognition; (c)
SP-Pairs, a measure of nonliteral language interpreta-
tion. Across ACS-SP scores, average internal consistency
has been reported as r 5 0.69–0.81, test–retest stability
coefficient as corrected r 5 0.60–0.70, and inter-scorer
agreement from 0.98 to 0.99. Normative scaled scores
are available for all ACS-SP subtests. Treatment effec-
tiveness on emotion recognition is modeled as the D
change scores of the ACS-SP scaled scores, that is, post
minus pre, such that positive (or negative) delta change
scores indicate increase (or decrease) in emotion recog-
nition abilities. In the prior pilot study involving VR-
SCT and young adults with autism [Kandalaft et al.,

Theory of mind.
The Social Attribution Task, also
known as the triangles task [Abell, Happe, & Frith,
2000] was administered to measure a person’s abilities
of theory of mind or ability to understand others’
intention. Videos were adapted from [Heider & Simmel,
1944], in which participants were asked to narrate the
movements of triangles presented in six separate brief
videos.
Narratives
were
recorded,
transcribed,
and
double-scored by two blind raters. Based upon the scor-
ing criteria established in previous research [Abell et al.,
2000], participants’ narratives were first scored on accu-
racy and attribution, respectively, and the two scores
were then summed up to derive a total score. The accu-
racy and attribution aspects were scored separately
using a 4-point Likert scale (0–3 point scale) for each
video, with 18 as the maximum possible score across all
6 videos for both accuracy and attribution, respectively.
More points were awarded when the participant stated
descriptions that were accurate to the nature of the
video (for the accuracy aspect), or when more mentaliz-
ing or emotional words were utilized to describe the
movement of the triangles (for the attribution aspect).
The triangles task has been shown to have a high test–
retest reliability of r 5 0.76–0.88 and concurrent validity
r 5 0.78–0.93 [Hu et al., 2010]. The order of the videos
was randomized and participants were presented with
different sets of videos at pre- and post-intervention
testing. In the prior pilot study involving VR-SCT and
young adults with autism [Kandalaft et al., 2013], the-
ory of mind changed significantly from pretreatment
(M 5 12.63,
SD 5 4.93)
to
posttreatment
(M 5 15.38,
SD 5 4.81), t(7) 5 3.45, P 5 0.01, Hedges’s gav [Lakens,
2013] 5 0.53.
fMRI Imaging Task
We
measured
the
pretreatment
and
posttreatment
BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) responses using
a well-established biological motion fMRI task [Bjorns-
dotter, Wang, Pelphrey, & Kaiser, 2016; Kaiser et al.,
2010; Ventola et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016, 2017a].
We selected this paradigm because it measures the neu-
ral activities of two key components of social informa-
tion processing [Kaiser et al., 2010], namely, socio-
emotional and socio-cognitive processing, which corre-
spond to the treatment targets of VR-SCT and the two
behavioral measures of emotion recognition and theory
of mind, respectively. The participants were scanned
while viewing coherent and scrambled point-light dis-
plays of biological motion created from motion capture
data. The coherent biological motion displays featured
an adult male actor performing movements relevant to
early childhood experiences, such as playing pat-a-cake
[Klin et al., 2009], and contained 16 points correspond-
ing to major joints. The scrambled motion animations
were created by selecting all the 16 points from the bio-
logical motion displays and randomly plotting their tra-
jectories on a black background (see Fig. S1 for sample
fMRI stimuli). Thus, the coherent and scrambled dis-
plays contained the same local motion information,
but only the coherent displays contained the configura-
tion of a person [Johansso, 1973]. During the MRI scan,
stimuli were presented using E-Prime 2.0 software (Psy-
chological Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Six
coherent biological motion clips (BIO) and six scram-
bled (SCR) motion clips were presented once each in an
alternating-block design (time per block, � 24 s). The
experiment began with a 20-s fixation period and ended
with a 16-s fixation period. The total duration was
328 s. The movies were presented without audio. The
participants
were
asked
to
watch
the
videos
and
reminded to remain still and alert. The imaging task
and stimuli are available from the authors upon reason-
able request.
Imaging Acquisition and Processing
Scanning was performed on a Siemens MAGNETOM 3
Tesla Tim Trio scanner at the Yale Magnetic Resonance
Research Center (for YCSC participants) or a Philips 3
Tesla MR system (for CBH-UTD participants) within 1
week before and after the treatment. Details regarding
the imaging parameters and individual-level processing
steps had been described in previous research [Yang
et al., 2016, 2017a,b). The participant-level contrast of
interest is BIO > SCR, which served as inputs for the
subsequent mass univariate fMRI analyses.
fMRI Analyses
We conducted mass univariate voxel-wise GLM analyses
across the whole brain to identify three kinds of clus-
ters: first, pretreatment BOLD activation to the contrast
of BIO > SCR significantly differs from posttreatment
BOLD activation at the group level; second, brain
changes in the contrast of BIO > SCR track with behav-
ioral change in theory of mind at the individual level;
third, brain changes in the contrast of BIO > SCR track
with behavioral change in emotion recognition at the
individual level. The analyses were conducted using
mixed-effects modeling with FSL’s FLAME (FMRIB’s
Local Analysis of Mixed Effects) 1 1 2 inference algo-
rithm, which provides highly accurate estimation of
group-level results that are generalizable to the popula-
tion. We employed a stringent cluster-defining thresh-
old of Z > 2.33, P < 0.01, while correcting for multiple
INSAR
Yang et al./Neural mechanisms underlying treatment effects
717
 comparisons at a cluster-level threshold of P < 0.05.
Information about the surviving clusters was reported,
including number of voxels in the cluster, the anatomi-
cal regions covered by the clusters based on the Desi-
kan–Killiany atlas [Desikan et al., 2006], the coordinates
of the peak voxels within each of the anatomical
regions, and the Z-statistics associated with the peak
voxels. Site, age, IQ, sex, and pretreatment autism
symptom severity using the SRS total raw scores were
mean-centered and controlled for as covariates of no
interest in all group-level univariate GLM analyses. This
was to ensure that the results could be generalized to
different sites, ages, IQ levels, sexes, and levels of pre-
treatment autism symptom severity. Finally, to under-
stand the functional relevance of the surviving clusters,
we
performed
quantitative
reverse
inferences
using
NeuroSynth
(http://www.neurosynth.org/)
[Yarkoni,
Poldrack, Nichols, Van Essen, & Wager, 2011]. Details
regarding the procedure can be found in previous
research [Yang et al., 2016, 2017b].
Results
Primary Clinical Outcome
As previously reported in our neuroprediction study
[Yang et al., 2017b], VR-SCT significantly improved
emotion recognition in terms of the ACS-SP scaled
scores from pretreatment (M 5 11.41, SD 5 4.42) to post-
treatment
(M 5 12.94,
SD 5 3.51),
D 5 1.53,
S.D.
of
D 5 2.72, t(16) 5 2.32, P 5 0.03 (two-tailed), Hedges’s gav
[Lakens, 2013] 5 0.38, and the CL (Common Language)
effect size [Mcgraw & Wong, 1992] indicates that after
controlling for individual differences, the likelihood
that a person’s emotional recognition score is higher at
post-treatment than pre-treatment is 71%. In addition,
VR-SCT marginally improved theory of mind in terms
of the total scores from the triangles task from pre-
treatment
(M 5 19.41,
SD 5 3.89)
to
post-treatment
(M 5 20.35,
SD 5 3.84),
D 5 0.94,
S.D.
of
D 5 1.95,
t(16) 5 1.99, P 5 0.06 (two-tailed), Hedges’s gav 5 0.24,
and the CL effect size indicates that after controlling
for individual differences, the likelihood that a person’s
theory of mind total score is higher at post-treatment
than pretreatment is 69%. This effect was significant
one-tailed, P 5 0.03, and therefore also as hypothesized.
The change scores of emotion recognition were not sig-
nificantly correlated with those of theory of mind,
r(15) 5 20.22, P 5 0.40, suggesting that they were tap-
ping improvement in distinctively different domains.
Neural Mechanisms of Change
Based on the evidence that VR-SCT induced behavioral
changes, we continued to answer the question of neural
mechanisms underlying the behavioral changes. This
question can be addressed in two ways. First, at the
group level, we compared the mean brain activations
before and after VR-SCT. Second, at the individual level,
we analyzed what brain changes tracked with behav-
ioral changes induced by VR-SCT.
Group mean brain change after VR-SCT.
At the
group level, as seen in Fig. S2, BIO > SCR activated simi-
lar brain regions before and after treatment. However,
when specifically comparing the mean BOLD responses
to BIO > SCR before and after VR-SCT, as shown in Fig.
2, there was a cluster (253 voxels) in the left superior
parietal lobule showing significant increase in the con-
trast of BIO > SCR. One-sample t-test further indicates
that the region tended to be deactivated to BIO > SCR
(or activated to SCR > BIO) before VR-SCT, t(16) 5 22.42,
P 5 0.03, Cohen’s d 5 20.57, but relatively neutral to
BIO > SCR
after
VR-SCT,
t 5 0.14,
P 5 0.89,
Cohen’s
d 5 0.03. Table 2 lists the peak significance and peak
coordinates of this cluster. To further interpret the pos-
sible functions associated with this cluster, we con-
ducted a NeuroSynth-based reverse inference analysis.
The top 10 NeuroSynth-decoded feature terms were eye
movements (0.18), reaching (0.15), saccades (0.14), rep-
resentation (0.13), observation (0.13), visually (0.13),
eye fields (0.12), execution (0.11), attention (0.11), and
foci (0.11); numbers within the parentheses are correla-
tion coefficients between the surviving cluster and the
meta-analysis maps of the feature terms in NeuroSynth.
This suggests that the cluster is primarily associated
with visual observation and attention.
Tracking
theory-of-mind
change
with
brain
change.
At the individual level, we correlated changes
in behavioral measure and changes in brain activation
to BIO > SCR, for theory of mind and emotion recogni-
tion, respectively. First, as seen in Fig. 3A, there was a
significant positive correlation in a cluster (591 voxels)
in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus. The
scatterplot illustrates the nature of the relationship,
where improvement in theory of mind was associated
with increase activation to BIO > SCR in this region,
and the estimated effect size was Pearson’s |r| 5 0.67.
There was no surviving region that showed negative
correlation between change in theory of mind and
change in brain activation. To further interpret the pos-
sible functions associated with this cluster, we con-
ducted a NeuroSynth-based reverse inference analysis.
The top 10 NeuroSynth-decoded feature terms were bio-
logical (0.10), multisensory (0.10), sense (0.10), action
observation (0.10), tone (0.09), observing (0.08), audi-
tory visual (0.08), attribute (0.07), observation (0.07),
and intentions (0.07). This suggests that the cluster is
primarily associated with social information processing,

INSAR
 and multisensory integration. Table 2 lists the peak sig-
nificance, peak coordinates, and anatomical locations
encompassed by the cluster.
Tracking emotion-recognition change with brain
change.
Second, as seen in Fig. 3B, there was a signifi-
cant negative correlation in a cluster (232 voxels) in the
left inferior frontal gyrus/ventrolateral prefrontal cor-
tex. The scatterplot illustrates the nature of the rela-
tionship, where improvement in emotion recognition
was associated with decrease activation to BIO > SCR in
this region, and the estimated effect size was Pearson’s
|r| 5 0.67. There was no surviving region that showed
positive correlation between change in emotion recog-
nition and change in brain activation. To further inter-
pret the possible functions associated with this cluster,
we conducted a NeuroSynth-based reverse inference
analysis. The top 10 NeuroSynth-decoded feature terms
were
competing
(0.20),
conflicting
(0.10),
shifting
(0.09), verb (0.08), phonological (0.07), semantically
(0.07), nouns (0.06), lexical (0.06), words (0.06), and
orthographic (0.05). This suggests that the cluster is pri-
marily associated with conflict resolution and language
processing. Table 2 lists the peak significance, peak
coordinates, and anatomical locations encompassed by
the cluster.

 Comparison with neural predictive biomarkers of
treatment effectiveness.
With this same dataset, we
had previously identified a set of brain regions in which
pretreatment activation predicted treatment effective-
ness, particularly on predicting improvement in emo-
tion recognition [Yang et al., 2017b]. Specifically, for
emotion-recognition change, the neural predictive bio-
markers (cluster-corrected) were located to (a) the left
posterior superior temporal sulcus, superior temporal
gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus (regions implicated
in processing verbal emotions), and (b) the right insula,
orbitofrontal cortex, and inferior frontal gyrus (regions
implicated in processing nonverbal emotions). Impor-
tantly, these predictive regions did not overlap with the
mechanistic
regions
for
emotion-recogniton
change
(cluster-corrected) as identified in the current study,
which were localized to the left inferior frontal gyrus
and
ventrolateral
prefrontal
cortices.
Nonetheless,
across all participants, the pretreatment activation to
BIO > SCR in the predictive regions was highly and pos-
itively
correlated
with
decreased
activation
to
BIO > SCR
in
the
mechanistic
regions,
r(15) 5 0.82,
P < 0.0001, that is, the stronger the activation in predic-
tive regions was at baseline, the greater the activation
reduction in mechanistic regions was from baseline to
endpoint.
Discussion
Neural Mechanisms of Change
This Phase I pilot trial evaluated behavioral and brain
changes
in
adults
with
high
functioning
ASD
in
response to a virtual reality social cognition training
protocol (VR-SCT) delivered over 5 weeks for a total of
10 hr. Specifically, we measured pre- to post- changes
in the behavioral domains of socio-emotional (i.e.,
emotional recognition) and socio-cognitive (theory of
mind as reflected in describing intentionality) and the
neural aspects of brain activation comparing treatment
response changes to social versus nonsocial motion. In
contrast to our previous neuroprediction study [Yang
et al., 2017b] that focused on how pretreatment brain

INSAR
 activity may be used to forecast behavioral changes, we
were particularly interested in the convergence between
behavioral and brain changes in the current study. Our
preliminary results can be summarized in four key
findings:
Group mean brain change after VR-SCT.
First of
all, we found the trained adults with ASD as a group
showed a significantly decreased brain activation to
nonsocial versus social stimuli in the left superior parie-
tal lobule (SPL). This parietal region has been linked to
the heightened visual attention to nonsocial features in
preference above social aspects [Klin et al., 2009], which
has been a pathognomonic and purportedly disabling
feature of autism. It has been suggested that individuals
with ASD tend to have difficulty in predicting events in
the social world and may compensate for this by rely-
ing on the nonsocial, predictable contingencies aspects
of the world to understand the world [Sinha et al.,
2014; Van de Cruys et al., 2014]. Our results suggest
that before the treatment, participants might have
engaged in significantly more visual attention for the
scrambled/nonsocial
versus
biological/social
stimuli;
with changes after the treatment showing the adults
with ASD attended roughly similarly to both types of
visual stimuli. Importantly, VR-SCT features repeatable
social practices in a motivating computer-based envi-
ronment that offers a safe place to attempt interaction
without
the
real-world
consequences
of
failure.
Although speculative, it is possible that VR-SCT had
made social events more predictable after treatment,
which in turn might have reduced the ASD partici-
pants’ visual attention to the nonsocial contingencies
of the stimuli.
Tracking
theory-of-mind
change
with
brain
change.
In addition, our results provide some of the
first evidence that brain activation to social versus non-
social in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus
(pSTS) tracks training-induced behavioral change in
theory of mind as measured by the Triangle task in
adults with ASD. This region, purportedly, is a hub for
socio-cognitive processing and involved in the temporal
integration of visual, auditory and somatosensory cues
of other’s behaviors [Pelphrey & Morris, 2006; Redcay,
2008; Yang et al., 2015]. Specifically, temporal integra-
tion is about the ability to construct and integrate
multi-dimensional information over time into a coher-
ent whole so that one can understand and predict the
happening of events over time (e.g., the ability to
understand and predict what people will do next when
they walk toward you and wave at you) [Kilner et al.,
2007; Koster-Hale & Saxe, 2013; Nakano et al., 2010;
Stevenson et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2015]. In our study,
it would require the ability of temporal integration to
understand
the
interactions
of
the
objects
in
the
depicted scenarios in the Triangle task. The brain-
behavior relationship identified in this particular brain
region also raises the possibility that researchers may
test whether concurrent intervention procedures in this
brain region may serve to facilitate even higher levels
of performance on the theory of mind task. For exam-
ple, oxytocin [Domes et al., 2014] has been found to be
able to increase the function of the right pSTS region in
adults with autism. This possibility to combine two or
more treatment to enhance treatment effectiveness war-
rants testing in future studies.
Tracking emotion-recognition change with brain
change.
Furthermore, our results showed that decreased
brain activation to social versus nonsocial in the left infe-
rior frontal gyrus (IFG) region tracked gains in socio-
emotional processing of identifying emotions. It has been
reported that there is a right- versus left-hemisphere
advantageous difference in face recognition and process-
ing emotional stimuli [Adolphs, 2002; Adolphs et al.,
2000; Ahern et al., 1991; Blonder et al., 1991; Buchanan
et al., 2000; Ley & Bryden, 1979; Morris et al., 1999;
Rama et al., 2001]. Although speculative, it is possible
that to successfully process emotional stimuli, one needs
to
shift
from
left-hemisphere
processing
to
right-
hemisphere processing, and decreasing the use of impli-
cated regions on the left hemisphere may contribute to
better emotion recognition. Our result is consistent with
this possibility. Anecdotally, some VR-SCT participants
stated that prior to training, they had a constant “inner
self-dialogue” preventing them from focusing on the
intent of what was being said in the conversation. As part
of the training, participants were instructed to utilize
strategies to focus on the social cues and implications of
other’s words and use that information to generate a
follow-up response. It is plausible that VR-SCT helps facili-
tate a shift away from a language-centered approach
toward a compensatory cognitive strategy to increase
attention to social information. Future research may
examine whether a left-to-right processing shift takes
place as a result of social training.
Comparison with neural predictive biomarkers of
treatment effectiveness.
Finally, adding to our prior
findings, the current results identified distinctly differ-
ent sets of brain regions as the neural mechanistic bio-
markers
associated
with
the
emotion-recognition
change (left IFG/vlPFC), than those previously reported
as the neural predictive biomarker brain region (left
temporal regions; right IFG, OFC, and insula) [Yang
et al., 2017b]. This pattern of results suggest that the
two functions—that is, predicting who may be primed
INSAR
Yang et al./Neural mechanisms underlying treatment effects
721
 to respond more advantageously from the treatment
versus mediating how the treatment works—may be
localized to separate regions. Interestingly, we found
that the stronger the baseline activation was in the pre-
dictive biomarker regions before treatment, the greater
the reduction in activation was from treatment baseline
to endpoint in the mechanistic biomarker regions.
Although speculative, this relation between the predic-
tive and mechanistic biomarker brain regions supports
the possibility that these regions may be functionally
connected in the context of behavioral changes. We
offer one interpretation proposing that stronger pre-
treatment brain responses in the predictive regions may
facilitate the participants to engage in a left-to-right
hemisphere shift in the IFG region when they were
trained to better process emotions. This and other pos-
sible explanations need further investigation.
Clinical Implications
Overall, the present findings support a potential for vir-
tual reality social scenario training to harness the socio-
emotional and socio-cognitive capacity and neuroplastic-
ity in adults with longstanding diagnosis of ASD. The
neurobiological mechanistic markers identified in this
research
may
have
a
number
of
clinically
relevant
research implications. First, they help advance our scien-
tific
understanding
of
how
the
treatment
works
to
improve supporting brain systems, perhaps suggesting
that interventionists could focus on the related psycho-
logical functions to refine the treatment, for example, the
temporal integration function implicated in the right
pSTS region for training theory of mind. Second, the neu-
ral mechanisms identified in this study potentially may
serve as a possible target to monitor and evaluate the pur-
ported
mechanisms
of
the
treatment,
for
example,
increased reliance on the right pSTS for change in theory
of mind. However, such an approach might depend on
clinicians’ ability to gather the data using imaging meth-
ods
relatively
inexpensive,
such
as
functional
near-
infrared spectroscopy. Third, the social brain regions pro-
vide a possible target for concurrent interventions (e.g.,
oxytocin) to boost the effectiveness of the primary treat-
ment. Overall, the pattern of findings from this Phase I
pilot trial offers promising directions for follow-up ran-
domized control trials research and open new avenues for
treatment development in adults with high functioning
ASD, a heretofore relatively neglected area of focus,
despite immense potential for improvement.
Limitations
There are several limitations to consider regarding this
research. First, the findings were limited to one single
treatment-only
group
in
a
pretest-posttest
design.
Future work should conduct randomized controlled tri-
als to further establish these findings. Second, the size
of our preliminary sample (N 5 17) was relatively small.
A larger sample would allow possible stratification of
the sample, which is important given the heterogeneity
of autism. Third, the primary clinical outcomes are lim-
ited to changes in emotion recognition and theory of
mind, respectively. Although these two abilities are
among the most basic abilities in socio-emotional and
socio-cognitive processing [Baron-Cohen et al., 1985;
Gallese et al., 2004] that underlie a wide range of social
skills and are also central to our understanding of ASD
deficits [Uljarevic & Hamilton, 2013], there is a need
for future research to include other ASD-related mea-
sures, such as interaction behaviors [Rice & Redcay,
2016] and conversation skills [Scattone, 2008].
Fourth, for the purpose of this study, we imple-
mented 5-week intervention [Kandalaft et al., 2013] and
measured behavioral and brain changes only during
this period. However, there is a need for future studies
to vary the duration of intervention and test how well
the behavioral and brain changes via the intervention
may be maintained and generalized after intervention.
It is possible that longer intervention time and/or a
maintenance plan (e.g., a brief course every 3 months
after the end of intervention) could lead to more lasting
and broadly generalized changes after the posttreat-
ment endpoint. Fifth, prior research showed that males
and females with ASD tend to differ in their severity
and ASD-related phenotypic presentation [Werling &
Geschwind, 2013]. Although we controlled for symp-
tom severity and gender, our sample is predominantly
male (15 out of 17). Future research should recruit
equal and larger number of participants in both gender
groups to address possible gender-specific neural mech-
anisms. Sixth, all participants were high-functioning
(IQ range 5 88–131) and it remains unclear whether the
findings may apply to lower-functioning individuals.
Importantly, the VR-SCT has an inclusion criterion of
IQ � 80 and future research needs to investigate other
treatment approaches for those who may be cognitively
impaired. Finally, the results are limited to young
adults with ASD and it is unclear how they are com-
pared to treatment work in children with ASD. In a
related project, we have collected neuroimaging data
from young children with ASD who received Pivotal
Response Treatment. We expect to compare the results
to the current work in a separate paper.
Conclusions
Despite the limitations, our study is the first to advance
the knowledge of neural mechanisms of response to
722
Yang et al./Neural mechanisms underlying treatment effects
INSAR
 treatment in adults with autism receiving VR-SCT.
These findings extend the window of critical time peri-
ods where individuals with ASD may be able to benefit
from even short term (10 hr) of intervention focused
on commonly encountered social exchanges during
young adulthood such as interviewing for a job, asking
someone for a date or negotiating with a friend when
disagreements occur. Such interventions may not only
improve social cognition skills at a critical stage when
adults with ASD are needing to develop social skills
that support independence, but also strengthen the
underlying brain networks to support higher social
functioning capacity. There is currently limited inter-
vention research in adults with ASD. This study moves
the field one step closer to the goal of providing
scientifically-based precise intervention for individuals
with ASD into adulthood.
