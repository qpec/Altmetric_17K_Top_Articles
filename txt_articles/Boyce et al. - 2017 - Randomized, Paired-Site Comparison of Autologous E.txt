Stable closure of full-thickness burn wounds remains a limitation to recovery from burns 
of greater than 50% of the total body surface area (TBSA). Hypothetically, engineered 
skin substitutes (ESS) consisting of autologous keratinocytes and fibroblasts attached 
to collagen-based scaffolds may reduce requirements for donor skin, and decrease 
mortality. ESS were prepared from split-thickness skin biopsies collected after enrollment 
of 16 pediatric burn patients into an approved study protocol. ESS and split-thickness 
autograft (AG) were applied to 15 subjects with full-thickness burns involving a mean of 
76.9% TBSA. Data consisted of photographs, tracings of donor skin and healed wounds, 
comparison of mortality with the National Burn Repository, correlation of TBSA closed 
wounds with TBSA full-thickness burn, frequencies of regrafting, and immunoreactivity 
to the biopolymer scaffold. One subject expired before ESS application, and 15 subjects 
received 2056 ESS grafts. The ratio of closed wound to donor areas was 108.7 
± 
9.7 
for ESS compared with a maximum of 4.0 
± 
0.0 for AG. Mortality for enrolled subjects 
was 6.25%, and 30.3% for a comparable population from the National Burn Repository 
(P < .05). Engraftment was 83.5 
± 
2.0% for ESS and 96.5 
± 
0.9% for AG. Percentage TBSA 
closed was 29.9 
± 
3.3% for ESS, and 47.0 
± 
2.0% for AG. These values were significantly 
different between the graft types. Correlation of % TBSA closed with ESS with % TBSA 
full-thickness burn generated an R2 value of 0.65 (P < .001). These results indicate that 
autologous ESS reduce mortality and requirements for donor skin harvesting, for grafting 
of full-thickness burns of greater than 50% TBSA. (J Burn Care Res 2017;38:61–70)

function, management of microbial contamination 
and infection, physical therapy, and psychosocial 
adaptation. However, recovery depends ultimately 
on closure of the wounds with autologous epider-
mis and connective tissue to provide stable healing 
with minimal scar.1 Furthermore, while wound clo-
sure is usually a requirement for discharge from the 
hospital, skin pliability and stability are essential for 
the recovery of range of motion2,3 and contribute 
importantly to long-term quality of life.
Several alternatives have been studied to accom-
plish more rapid wound closure.4,5 Temporary 
wound coverage before autografting has been 
reported with a bilayered, allogeneic skin sub-
stitute.6 Cultured epithelial autografts applied as 
partially stratified, keratinocyte sheets have been 
studied extensively,7,8 but are reported to blister, 
ulcerate, and remain mechanically fragile due to 
deficient formation of basement membrane.9 Cul-
tured keratinocytes have also been sprayed as cell 
suspensions10 over partial-thickness burns,11 or a 
dermal substitute,12,13 but the time to healing may 
be lengthy due to the slow organization of the cul-
tured cell suspensions into stratified, keratinized 
epidermis. Replacement of dermal tissue has also 
been shown to reduce long-term morbidity from 
scarring. Dermal substitutes from natural or engi-
neered sources8,14–16 have been reported to provide 
connective tissue beneath either epidermal auto-
graft, or cultured keratinocytes. More recently, 
favorable results have been reported using a bilay-
ered, autologous skin substitute in an initial clini-
cal trial.17 However, none of these alternatives has 
displaced unmeshed, split-thickness skin autograft 
(AG), which has been reported to provide superior 
results in pediatric burns, and grafting to the face, 
hands, or genitalia.18–20
Previous reports from this laboratory have 
described the design and testing of engineered skin 
substitutes (ESS) prepared from cultured epidermal 
keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts attached to col-
lagen–glycosaminoglycan (GAG) scaffolds.21–23 The 
epidermal substitute stratifies and keratinizes in vitro 
to initiate formation of an epidermal barrier.24,25 
Proliferating keratinocytes attach directly to dermal 
fibroblasts on the surface of the biopolymer scaffold, 
and initiate development of a basement membrane 
that inhibits blistering after healing.23,26 Clinical 
experience with this model has shown healing of 
burns, surgical wounds, or chronic wounds.27–30 The 
present study is a prepivotal investigation of autolo-
gous ESS (previously called “cultured skin substi-
tutes”29,31) to evaluate whether this device provides 
new medical benefits for treatment of burns of greater 
than 50% of the TBSA. Subjects were enrolled from 
2007 to 2010, and were followed for 1 year for data 
collection. Reduced mortality for these subjects in 
comparison to data from the National Burn Reposi-
tory (NBR)32 was presented previously.33
METHODS
Subjects and Experimental Design 
This study was performed from 2007 to 2010 with 
a protocol approved by the Institutional Review 
Board of the University of Cincinnati, and under 
an investigational device exemption (IDE) applica-
tion regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA). Under this IDE, autologous ESS 
were considered as medical devices. All subjects 
were enrolled into the study with informed consent 
forms, and acknowledged the protection of health-
care information according to the Health Insur-
ance Portability and Accountability Act. During an 
inspection by FDA in 2006, deficiencies in protocol 
performance were cited, including lack of data moni-
toring. In 2007, FDA issued a Data Integrity Hold 
on the IDE, but the investigators were permitted to 
continue subject recruitment by compassionate use 
enrollments.34 This report summarizes results from 
those enrollments. In addition, an audit of retro-
spective data and monitoring of prospective data 
were required. All data collection was completed for 
all subjects reported here, data were either audited 
or monitored, and the Hold was lifted. This study 
was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov titled, “Autol-
ogous Engineered Skin Substitutes for Closure of 
Skin Wounds”:
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00591
513?term=Cultured+skin+substitutes&rank=2
The study design consisted of a prospective, ran-
domized, open-label, paired-site comparison of 
excised, full-thickness burns grafted with ESS and 
AG. Of the 16 subjects, one male subject expired 
before the ESS grafts were prepared. The remaining 
15 subjects survived, completed the study and were 
included in the data analysis.
ESS were meshed at a ratio of 1 to 1.5 and not 
expanded, and AG was meshed and expanded 
between 1 to 1.5 and 1 to 4. Application sites were 
paired by selecting adjacent, contralateral, or ante-
rior-posterior areas that required skin grafting. Two 
sites (~150 
cm2 each) were randomized as “A” or 
“B” prior to the beginning of the study.31 Compara-
tive grafting was performed in one procedure for 
each subject. If additional applications of ESS were 
performed, they were measured only for closed areas 
of wounds. If additional applications of AG were

performed, they were not evaluated.29,31 The main 
hypothesis of the study was that ESS close greater 
areas of wounds than AG per unit of skin autograft 
harvested.
Data Collection and Calculations 
The mortality rate in this study population was com-
pared by a one sample z-test to values from the 2012 
NBR32 for patients between 0 and 19.9 years of age, 
and burns of 50% TBSA and greater. Quantitative 
measurements consisted of tracings and planimetry 
of skin biopsies used to generate ESS, and tracings of 
treated areas on post-operative days (POD) 14 and 
28. TBSA was calculated according to Mosteller,35 
and % burn by using the Lund-Browder formula.36 
From the area tracings and planimetry, calculations 
were made of:
1. % Area closed at POD 14 and 28 = (closed area/
total treated area) × 100
2. Ratio of closed:donor areas at POD 28 = area 
closed with ESS/donor area
3. % TBSA closed at POD 28 = (area closed with 
ESS/TBSA) × 100
Engraftment was defined as the percentage of 
treated areas closed with dry epithelium at POD 14. 
For AG, the ratio of closed-to-donor areas was 
assigned as single value of 4 per harvest, and the 
% TBSA closed was calculated as the % TBSA full-
thickness burn minus the % TBSA closed with 
ESS. Regrafting of comparative sites was recorded 
through POD 28, was scored as “None”, “Partial,” 
or “Total”, and expressed as percentages of subjects 
treated.
Formation of antibodies to the biopolymer scaf-
fold was assessed by collection of serum prior to the 
first application of ESS, and 28 days or later after 
exposure. Post-exposure sera were tested by Enzyme-
Linked ImmunoSorbant Assay (ELISA) compared to 
pretreatment sera, and positive control sera from rab-
bits immunized with a homogenate of the collagen–
GAG scaffold together with Freund’s adjuvant.
Wound biopsies were collected before surgical 
application of ESS and AG, and as possible up to 
1 year after grafting. Histological assessments were 
informational only.
Preparation, Quality Assurance, and Delivery 
of Autologous ESS
Biopsy samples of split-thickness skin (0.010–0.012 
inches thick) were collected as early as possible after 
injury, usually during the first operative procedure. 
The absolute areas (cm2) to be treated with ESS and 
for the ESS biopsy for each patient were estimated 
with the following formulae31:
 
4a.  
% TBSA eligible for ESS = (% TBSA of full-
thickness burn) – (40% TBSA estimated to be 
treated with AG)
 
4b.  
Absolute area (cm2) to be treated with ESS = 
(% TBSA eligible for ESS) × (TBSA [cm2])
 
5. Absolute area (cm2) of ESS biopsy = Absolute 
area (cm2) to be treated with ESS × 0.01
Formula 4a assumed that about 40% TBSA would 
be treated with AG during the time of ESS prepa-
ration, based on two skin grafting operations dur-
ing about 4 weeks covering about 20% TBSA per 
operation. In cases of very extensive burns (eg, >80% 
TBSA), the value of 40% TBSA coverage with AG 
was revised downward on the advice of the medi-
cal staff, with a consequent increase in biopsy area 
(Formula 5). Epidermal keratinocytes and dermal 
fibroblasts were isolated and propagated as previ-
ously described.37,38 Fibroblasts were inoculated at 
3.75–5.0 
× 
105 cells/cm2 onto collagen–GAG scaf-
folds,39 followed 1 day or later by keratinocytes at 
0.75–1.0 
× 
106 cells/cm2, and incubation at the air–
liquid interface was performed to promote attach-
ment and keratinization.23,40,41 ESS (approximately 
25–30 
cm2 each) were usually meshed as described 
above, and applied on incubation day 10 to 14. Each 
dose of ESS consisted typically of 32 ESS devices 
with a total area of 750 to 1000 
cm2.
Wound Preparation, Grafting and 
Postoperative Care 
Burn eschar was excised as early as possible after com-
pletion of resuscitation, and sites planned for treat-
ment with ESS were covered with cadaveric allograft, 
or the dermal replacement, Integra® Dermal Regen-
eration Template (Integra LifeSciences Corp, Plains-
boro, NJ).28,42 Grafting and post-operative care were 
performed as described previously.31,43,44
Statistical Analyses 
Student’s t-test was used for comparisons between 
graft types. Spearman’s rank order was applied to 
correlations between factors. Fisher’s exact test 
was used to distinguish differences in frequencies 
of events. Analysis of variance detected differences 
among multiple groups. Data were independently 
audited or monitored, and reviewed by an indepen-
dent Data Safety Monitoring Board. Primary analyses 
of data for quantitative end points were performed 
on POD 28. Data from positive/negative scoring of 
site regrafting were subjected to Fischer’s exact test.

For the end point, ratio of closed-to-donor areas, a 
single-value t-test was applied to compare ESS to a 
maximum value of 4 per harvest of AG. Actual values 
for expansion of AG were most often less than 3, but 
were not recorded for all AG applied to all patients in 
this study, and none was greater than 4. This statisti-
cal approach minimizes the benefit of ESS for this 
end point, and therefore was considered the most 
conservative statistical approach. Statistical signifi-
cance was accepted at the 95% confidence level.
RESULTS
Sixteen subjects were enrolled between February 
2007 and July 2010. Subjects were consecutive 
hospital admissions who met enrollment inclusion/
exclusion criteria. Mean age (±SEM) was 6.3 
± 
1.1 
years, range of 1.4 to 17.5. Fourteen subjects were 
males and two females. Mean TBSA burn was 
79.1 
± 
2.2%, range of 59.5 to 95.0%. Mean FT TBSA 
burn was 77.9 
± 
2.4%, range 58.8 to 95.0%. Mean 
TBSA ESS per subject was 33.4 
± 
3.5%, range 9.7 to 
71.6%. Mean number of days from skin harvest to 
first application was 32.1 
± 
1.1, range 24 to 42.
Figure 1 shows microscopic anatomy of AG (Fig-
ure 1A) and ESS (Figure 1B) before grafting. Both 
had dermal and epidermal components with a total 
thickness of less than 400 μm. The dermal compo-
nent of ESS consisted of reticulations of collagen–
GAG biopolymer populated with cultured fibroblasts 
to which the epidermal component was attached 
biologically. The epidermal component consisted of 
cultured keratinocytes that stratified, and formed an 
analog of stratum corneum, which was the primary 
component of the epidermal barrier. The ESS lacked 
blood vessels, so were perfused entirely by angiogen-
esis, rather than by inosculation of blood vessels in 
the wound to those in the graft as occurred in AG.
In this study, 2056 ESS grafts totaling an area of 
4.89 m2 were applied in 59 operative procedures. An 
informational example of surgical application of ESS 
and healing during the first 2 months after surgery is 
shown in Figure 2. In this subject, ESS were applied 
(Figure 2B) and accomplished more than 90% 
wound closure at POD 14. At POD 28 (Figure 2C), 
the closed wounds were stable and use of pressure 
garments was begun. The healed ESS remained 
stable, pliable, and hypopigmented at POD 62 
( 
Figure 2D). Histological anatomy of wound beds 
had reticulations of Integra with fibrovascular tissue, 
and were observed at the pregraft sites of both ESS 
and AG (Figure 2E, F). At POD 105, the epider-
mis had matured, and remained stable and tightly 
adhered to connective tissue in both closed wounds 
(Figure 2G, H). Neither healed ESS nor AG devel-
oped glands or follicles. The dermal–epidermal junc-
tion remained relatively linear indicating the absence 
of rete peg formation.
Healed wounds remained pliable and hypopig-
mented at POD 360 (Figure 3A, B). By 1 year after 
grafting in this subject, the autograft comparative 
site had developed hair growth by transplantation 
from the donor site (Figure 3C), and the ESS site 
was smooth and without hair or glands (Figure 3D).
The mean ratio of closed wound area to donor skin 
area for ESS was 108.7 vs a maximum of 4 per har-
vest of AG (Figure 4A). This significant difference (P 
< .01) represents a reduction of donor skin harvesting 
of more than an order of magnitude by use of ESS,

and demonstrates the primary medical benefit of this 
alternative therapy. Mortality in this study ( 
Figure 4B) 
was 6.25% (1/16), which was significantly lower 
(P = .037) than a rate of 30.3% (305/1008) for a pop-
ulation of similar age (0–19.9 years) and burn magni-
tude (50% TBSA or greater) reported in the NBR. 
The mean epithelial engraftment and wound closure 
at POD 14 (Figure 4C) was 83.5% for ESS compared 
to 96.5% for AG, which was a significant difference 
 
(P < .05). The mean percentage TBSA closed with ESS 
was 29.9% and 47.0% for AG at POD 28 ( 
Figure 4D). 
This difference was significant (P < .05).
A strong positive correlation (R2 = .65) was 
found between the % TBSA of wound closure 
with ESS at POD 28 and the % TBSA full-thick-
ness burn ( 
Figure 5A). Importantly, the range 
of %TBSA closed extended to 60% or greater 
in selected cases, emphasizing the therapeutic 
impact of this device in life-threatening burns.

28 was not significantly different between groups 
( 
Figure 5B), occurred at a rate of 26.7% (4/15) 
for ESS, and each of these regrafting events was 
partial. There was no regrafting of comparative 
sites treated with AG.
Antibody production specific to the collagen–
GAG biopolymer scaffold is shown in Figure 5C. 
Single or multiple graftings of ESS did not stimu-
late significant increases in specific antibodies to the 
scaffold. By comparison, immunization of rabbits 
with homogenized scaffolds stimulated a significant 
increase in specific antibody binding.
DISCUSSION
Data from this study support the hypothesis that 
autologous ESS reduce harvesting of donor skin in 
pediatric patients for closure of burn injuries involv-
ing greater than 50% TBSA. The reduction in donor 
skin requirements implies reductions in donor site 
morbidity, numbers of skin-grafting operations, and 
intensive care days, but those data were not collected 
in this study. The reduction in donor site harvesting 
is interpreted to result from quantitative advantages 
provided by ESS.

The epithelium of ESS forms a partial barrier and 
basement membrane in vitro,24,29 which promote 
epithelial closure after grafting. Engraftment of ESS 
occurs between connective tissue in the wound and the 
dermal substitute of ESS in analogy to AG.28 On vas-
cularization of the dermal component of ESS, which 
occurs during the first week after grafting, the ESS 
begins to stabilize as barrier function, basement mem-
brane, and nutrient supply are restored.27 By POD 7, 
engrafted ESS have closed the wounds with functional 
epidermal barrier.45 By POD 14, healed ESS has suf-
ficient mechanical strength to allow physical therapy to 
begin.29 By POD 28 ( 
Figure 2B), pressure garments, 
which help to control scar, can be worn without 
loss of ESS.31 Unmeshed AG applied as sheet grafts 
on the hands and face has been reported to reduce 
scar formation, and improve functional and cosmetic 
outcomes.18,19 Application of ESS sheets without 
expansion of the mesh may provide similar advantages. 
In this subject population, engraftment (Figure 4C) 
was greater than 80%, but remained significantly lower 
than AG. This difference introduced a requirement 
for minor regrafting of ESS sites at a higher, but not 
significantly different, frequency (4/15) than AG 
(0/15) (Figure 5B), despite a reduction in donor site 
harvesting.
The primary medical benefit of ESS is defined by 
a ratio of closed areas to donor areas of greater than 
100 (Figure 4A). This value was compared statisti-
cally to a maximum expansion of 1:4 for AG, but 
the actual expansion of AG was not measured in this 
study. In most cases, the usual expansion of AG was 
1:2. Therefore, the conservation of donor skin with 
ESS compared to AG may actually have been as much 
as 50-fold. The factor of donor skin expansion of 
greater than 100-fold by ESS suggests hypothetically

that less than 1% TBSA of split-thickness donor skin 
is sufficient to resurface the body completely with 
ESS. This benefit has been realized in selected cases 
of greater than 90% TBSA full-thickness burns, in 
which a donor biopsy of less than 1% TBSA was 
required. Based on these selected cases, it may be 
possible that common use of ESS could increase the 
LD50 for burns, which is estimated between 70 and 
80% TBSA in healthy adults, but is much lower in 
the elderly, and the very young.32 The positive cor-
relation of % TBSA closed with ESS to % TBSA full-
thickness burn (Figure 5A) demonstrates that ESS 
remain effective even as the magnitude and complex-
ity of the burn injury are at their greatest. This was 
shown not to be true for cultured epithelial auto-
grafts in which effectiveness correlated inversely with 
burn magnitude.46
Despite conservation of donor skin, ESS average 
area (29.9% TBSA) covered was less than AG (47.0% 
TBSA). This apparent anomaly was attributed to 
greater frequencies of burns between 50 and 80% 
TBSA in which lower %TBSA was treated with ESS, 
and to limited laboratory capacity to generate the 
engineered grafts. Nonetheless, the range of areas 
closed with ESS extended to about 70% TBSA. It 
was also observed that because of the sparing of 
donor skin by ESS, the mesh ratio for AG for most 
cases could be reduced to 1:2 or less, compared to 
as much as 1:4. This reduction of mesh ratio likely 
promoted faster healing, and less scarring of wounds 
closed with AG.18,19 This indirect benefit may also 
contribute to improved functional outcome and 
long-term recovery.
Among the limitations and qualifications of this 
study were the small sample size, the paired-site 
comparison format rather than randomized subject 
populations, and performance at a single clinical site. 
Regarding samples size and mortality, the mortality 
rate of 6.25% (1/16) was significantly different from 
data in the NBR, but subjects were not matched for 
demographic or medical parameters, so the observed 
mortality rate will require a larger sample size, 
or subject matching, before it may be considered 
conclusive.
Certain end points, such as length of hospital 
stay, and numbers of operations to complete skin 
grafting, were not assessed because of the lim-
ited capacity of the investigators’ laboratories to 
produce the ESS grafts (~900 cm2/week). How-
ever, in young subjects with small absolute TBSA, 
but large TBSA full-thickness burns (eg, >80%), 
production capacity was sufficient to complete 
skin grafting in less than 8 weeks from subject 
enrollment. Therefore, the technical capability

positive correlation (R2 = .65, P < .001) was detected be-
tween % TBSA closed with ESS at POD 28, and % TBSA

to complete closure of large TBSA, full-thickness 
burns should be possible within 2 months for 
most patients who have few comorbid conditions, 
if production capacity of ESS is not limiting. In 
addition, the follow-up period for this study was 
limited to 1 year, and numbers of reconstructive 
surgeries needed during several years of pediatric 
growth was not included in the data collection. 
Anecdotal observations from a previous study,31 
and from this study, suggest that the ESS grows 
proportionately with the pediatric subjects. These 
observations require careful examination clinically 
and biologically, and will be considered for quan-
tification as end points in future studies.
This study was intended to serve as a phase I/II 
trial to demonstrate safety and efficacy of autologous 
ESS for closure of extensive, full-thickness burns. 
Because subjects were enrolled at only one burn 
center, there was no “standard of care” population 
without use of ESS as an investigative therapy. There 
were also no exclusion criteria for known factors that 
increase mortality such as inhalation injury, sepsis, or 
comorbid conditions such as obesity, diabetes, car-
diovascular disease, substance abuse, or alcohol or 
tobacco use. However, in this pediatric population, 
these comorbid conditions occurred less frequently 
than in adults.
Remaining anatomic deficiencies of ESS com-
pared to AG include, but are not limited to, 
hypopigmentation and absence of blood vessels, 
nerve, sweat and sebaceous glands, and hair fol-
licles. Hypopigmentation and lack of a vascular 
plexus have been addressed in preclinical studies 
from this laboratory.47,48 Hypothetically, hair fol-
licles49,50 and sweat and sebaceous glands51 may be 
regenerated in vitro, but accomplishment of these 
goals will require regulation of developmental sig-
nals in vitro, which is beyond the scope of the pres-
ent study. However, it is important to recognize 
that AG also does not regenerate glands or folli-
cles. Therefore, regeneration of hair and/or glands 
in ESS would offer anatomic structures found only 
in full-thickness skin.
CONCLUSIONS
These results show that the ESS model offers new 
alternatives for: increased availability of autolo-
gous skin substitutes for grafting and closure of 
extensive, full-thickness burns; reduced morbid-
ity from harvesting of donor skin in patients with 
needs for closure of extensive, full-thickness burns; 
and reduced mortality in pediatric burn patients.
