Abstract
Natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphomas are a rare and distinct subtype of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. NK/T-cell lymphomas are predomi-
nantly extranodal and most of these are nasal type, often localized to the upper aerodigestive tract. Because extranodal NK/T-cell 
lymphomas (ENKL) are rare malignancies, randomized trials comparing different regimens have not been conducted to date and 
standard therapy has not yet been established for these patients. These NCCN Guidelines Insights discuss the recommendations for 
the diagnosis and management of patients with ENKL as outlined in the NCCN Guidelines for T-Cell Lymphomas.

Overview
Natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphomas are a rare 
and distinct subtype of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas.1 
NK/T-cell lymphomas are predominantly extranodal 
and most are nasal type, often localized to the upper 
aerodigestive tract, including the nasal cavity, naso-
pharynx, paranasal sinuses, tonsils, hypopharynx, and 
larynx.2 However, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphomas 
(ENKLs) can have an extranasal presentation, with 
skin, testis, and gastrointestinal tract being the most 
common sites of extranasal involvement or meta-
static disease.3,4 
Diagnosis
Biopsy specimens should include edges of the le-
sions to increase the odds of having viable tissue (see 
NKTL-1; see above). It may also be useful to perform 
multiple nasopharyngeal biopsies for the evaluation 
of occult disease even in areas that are not clearly 
involved on endoscopic examination. Adequate im-

DIAGNOSISa
SUBTYPES
ESSENTIAL: 
• Hematopathology review of all slides with at least one paraffi
 in 
block representative of the tumor. Rebiopsy if consult material is 
nondiagnostic.
• Excisional or incisional biopsy is preferred over core needle 
biopsy. An FNA biopsy alone is not suffi
 cient for the initial 
diagnosis of lymphoma.b A core needle biopsy is not optimal 
but can be used under certain circumstances. In certain 
circumstances, when a lymph node is not easily accessible for 
excisional or incisional biopsy, a combination of core needle 
biopsy and FNA biopsy in conjunction with appropriate ancillary 
techniques may be suffi
 cient for diagnosis.
• Adequate immunophenotyping to establish diagnosisc,d
�IHC panel: For high clinical suspicion of NKTL, fi
 rst panel 
should include: cCD3ɛ, CD56, EBER-ISHe
USEFUL UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES: 
• Molecular analysis to detect clonal T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) 
gene rearrangementsf or other assessment of clonalityg
• IHC panel: 
�B-cell lineage: CD20
�T-cell lineage: CD2, CD7, CD8, CD4, CD5
�Other: CD30, Ki-67 
Subtypes included:
• Extranodal NK/T-cell, 
nasal type
Subtypes not
included:
• NK-cell leukemias 
• Precursor NK-cell 
neoplasm
aIt is preferred that treatment occur at centers with expertise in the management of this 
disease.
bNecrosis is very common in diagnostic biopsies and may delay diagnosis significantly. 
Biopsy should include the edges of lesions to increase the odds of having viable tissue. 
Useful to perform multiple nasopharyngeal biopsies even in areas not clearly involved.
cSee Use of Immunophenotyping/Genetic Testing in Differential Diagnosis of Mature 
B-Cell and NK/T-Cell Neoplasms (See B-cell Lymphomas Guidelines).
dTypical NK-cell immunophenotype: CD20-, CD2+, cCD3ɛ+ (surface CD3-), CD4-, CD5-, 
CD7-/+, CD8-/+, CD43+, CD45RO+, CD56+, T-cell receptor (TCR)αß-, TCRγδ-, EBV- 
EBER+. TCR and Ig genes are germline (NK lineage). Cytotoxic granule proteins (TIA1, 
perforin, granzyme B) are usually expressed. Typical T-cell immunophenotype: CD2+ 
sCD3+ cCD3e+, CD4,5,7,8 variable, CD56+/- EBV-EBER+ TCRαß or γδ+, cytotoxic 
granule proteins +. TCR genes are clonally rearranged.
eNegative result should prompt pathology review for alternative diagnosis.
fTCR clonal gene rearrangement results should be interpreted with caution. 
TCR clonal gene rearrangement can be seen in non-malignant conditions or 
may not be demonstrated in all cases of CTCL. Demonstration of identical 
clones in skin, blood, and/or lymph node may be helpful in selected cases.
gSuch as FISH, karyotype, genomic analysis.

munophenotyping is essential to confirm the diag-
nosis. 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is always 
present in ENKL and should be determined using 
EBV-encoded RNA in situ hybridization (EBER-
ISH). A negative EBER-ISH result should prompt 
hematopathology review for an alternative diagno-
sis. Clonal T-cell receptor (TCR) gene  rearrange-
ments have been found in up to a third of cases with 
ENKL, nasal type (ENKL-NT).3 Molecular analysis 
to detect clonal TCR gene rearrangements may be 
useful under certain circumstances. Ki-67 expres-
sion has been reported to be prognostic in patients 
with stage I/II ENKL-NT.5,6 High Ki-67 expression 
(≥65%) was associated with a shorter overall survival 
(OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). In multivari-
ate analysis, Ki-67 expression and primary site of in-
volvement were found to be independent prognostic 
factors for both OS and DFS.5 
Workup 
Initial workup should include a history and physical 
examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies, 
as outlined on NKTL-2 (see above). Bone marrow 
involvement is uncommon at diagnosis and occurs 
in <10% of patients.7 Morphologically negative bi-
opsies should be evaluated with EBER-ISH and, if 
positive, should be considered involved.7–10 
Measurement of EBV DNA viral load using 
quantitative PCR is useful in the diagnosis and often 
in the monitoring of disease. EBV DNA viral load 
correlates well with clinical stage, response to thera-
py, and poor survival.11,12 EBV DNA ≥6.1×107 copies/
mL at presentation has been shown to be associated 
with an inferior DFS.11 Pretreatment EBV DNA lev-
el in whole blood and plasma has been shown to be 
a good predictor of response and survival after treat-
ment with asparaginase-based regimens in patients 
with ENKL-NT.13–16 In the phase II study from the 
NK-Cell Tumor Study Group, the overall response 
rate (ORR) was significantly higher in patients with

jEBV viral load is important in diagnosis and possibly in monitoring of disease. A positive result is consistent with NK/T-cell, nasal type. Lack of 
normalization of EBV viremia should be considered indirect evidence of persistent disease.

<105 copies/mL of EBV DNA in whole blood before 
initiation of asparaginase-based chemotherapy (90% 
vs 20%; P=.007) and in those with <104 copies/mL 
of EBV DNA in plasma (95% vs 29%; P=.002).15 In 
addition, the incidence of grade 4 nonhematologic 
toxicity was significantly higher among patients with 
≥105 copies/mL of EBV DNA in whole blood (100% 
vs 29%; P=.007) and in those with ≥104 copies/mL of 
EBV DNA in plasma (86% vs 26%; P=.002). 
A prognostic index of NK lymphoma (PINK) 
has been proposed for ENKL treated with non–an-
thracycline-based chemotherapy (NKTL-A; page 
129).17 In a retrospective analysis of 527 patients 
aged >60 years, stage III or IV disease, distant lymph 
node involvement, and non–nasal-type disease were 
identified as predictors of OS and progression-free 
survival (PFS).17 Among the 328 patients with data 
for EBV DNA, detectable EBV DNA measured with 
quantitative PCR was a significant predictor of OS. 
Based on these risk factors, PINK stratified patients 
into 3 risk groups (low-risk [no risk factors]; interme-
diate-risk [1 risk factor]; and high-risk [≥2 risk fac-
tors]) with 3-year OS rates of 81%, 62%, and 25%, 
respectively. PINK-E (for patients with data for EBV 
DNA) also stratified patients into 3 risk groups (low-
risk [0 or 1 risk factor]; intermediate-risk [2 risk fac-
tors]; and high-risk [≥3 risk factors]) with 3-year OS 
rates of 81%, 55%, and 28%, respectively. 
The NCCN Guidelines recommend measure-
ment of EBV-DNA load and calculation prognostic 
index (PINK or PINK-E) as part of initial workup.

ENKL, more patients with ENKL-NT received RT 
with or without anthracycline-based chemotherapy 
compared with those with extranasal ENKL (52% 
vs 24%); the remainder of patients received che-
motherapy alone.3 In the subgroup of patients with 
early-stage ENKL-NT (n=57), the addition of RT to 
chemotherapy resulted in a significantly improved 
3-year OS rate compared with chemotherapy alone 
(57% vs 30%; P=.045).3 
In a retrospective review of 105 patients with 
localized stage I/II ENKL-NT, RT alone resulted in 
higher CR rates than chemotherapy alone (83% vs 
20%), and CR rates improved to 81% among pa-
tients who received RT following chemotherapy.20 
The 5-year OS rates were similar among the patient 
groups that received RT alone (66%; n=31), RT fol-
lowed by chemotherapy (77%; n=34), and chemo-
therapy followed by RT (74%; n=37). Notably, in 
this study, the addition of chemotherapy to RT did 
not appear to improve OS outcomes.20 
Early or upfront RT at doses of ≥54 Gy (alone or 
in combination with chemotherapy) was associated 
with better survival outcomes in patients with local-
ized ENKL-NT in the upper aerodigestive tract.21 
Among 74 patients who received RT as a compo-
nent of initial therapy (alone or in combination with 
chemotherapy), the 5-year OS and DFS rates were 
76% and 60%, respectively, for patients treated with 
RT doses of ≥54 Gy compared with 46% and 33%, 
respectively, for those treated with RT doses of <54 
Gy. Among patients with stage I disease, upfront RT 
was associated with higher survival rates than early 
RT following initial chemotherapy (5-year OS rates: 
90% vs 49%, respectively; P=.012; 5-year DFS rates: 
79% vs 40%, respectively; P=.021). 
RT following chemotherapy also resulted in sig-
nificantly higher response rates and prolonged sur-
vival in patients with advanced-stage disease.23 In a 
retrospective analysis of 73 patients with stage III–IV 
disease, the ORR was significantly higher in patients 
treated with chemotherapy followed by RT than

in those treated with chemotherapy alone (82% vs 
29%; P<.001). The 2-year OS rates were 58% ver-
sus 15%, respectively (P<.001), and 2-year PFS rates 
were 46% versus 8%, respectively (P<.001). RT sig-
nificantly improved the prognosis of patients who 
experienced CR or partial response (PR) after ini-
tial chemotherapy (2-year OS rates: 82% vs 40%, 
respectively; P=.002; 2-year PFS rates: 66% vs 23%, 
respectively; P=.008) but failed to provide a signifi-
cant survival advantage among those with stable or 
progressive disease after initial chemotherapy.
Concurrent Chemoradiation
Concurrent chemoradiation (± consolidation che-
motherapy) is a feasible and effective treatment for 
localized ENKL. In the phase I/II study conducted by 
the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG0211), 
high-risk patients with stage I/II nasal disease (n=33; 
lymph node involvement, B symptoms, and el-
evated lactate dehydrogenase levels) were treated 
with concurrent chemoradiation (RT 50 Gy and 
3 courses of chemotherapy with dexamethasone/
etoposide/ifosfamide/carboplatin [DeVIC]).25 With 
a median follow-up of 32 months, 2-year OS was 
78% and the CR rate was 77%. Long-term follow-
up from this study (median follow-up, 68 months) 
reported 5-year PFS and OS rates of 67% and 73%, 
respectively.26 Late toxicities were manageable with 
few grade 3 or 4 events, which included only one 
grade 3 event (irregular menstruation) and one grade 
4 event (perforation of nasal skin). The results of a 
more recent retrospective analysis (358 patients; 257 
patients had localized disease) also reported favor-
able response and survival rates for patients treated 
with a concurrent RT-DeVIC regimen.27 After a me-
dian follow-up of 5.6 years, 5-year OS and PFS rates 
were 72% and 61%, respectively. In this analysis, 
only 4% of patients with localized disease were clas-
sified as high risk according to PINK. In multivariate 
analysis, elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor was

Another phase II study also reported promising 
results with concurrent chemoradiation (cisplatin 
plus RT at 40.0–52.8 Gy) followed by 3 cycles of 
etoposide, ifosfamide, cisplatin, and dexamethasone 
(VIPD) in patients with ENKL-NT (n=30; 21 with 
stage I/II disease and 9 with stage III/IV disease).28 
The CR rate was 73% after initial chemoradiation 
and increased to 80% after VIPD. The estimated 
3-year PFS and OS rates were 85% and 86%, re-
spectively.28 The safety and efficacy of concurrent 
chemoradiation followed by consolidation chemo-
therapy in patients with localized ENKL-NT has also 
been confirmed in more recent studies.29,30

ENKL cells are associated with a high expression of 
P-glycoprotein, leading to multidrug resistance that 
is likely responsible for the poor response to conven-
tional anthracycline-based chemotherapy.31 Aspar-
aginase-based or pegaspargase-based regimens have 
been shown to improve response rates.32–40
The SMILE regimen (dexamethasone/metho-
trexate/ifosfamide/L-asparaginase/etoposide) 
has 
been evaluated in patients with newly diagnosed and 
relapsed/refractory (R/R) ENKL-NT.32,33 A phase II 
study from the NK-Cell Tumor Study Group evalu-
ated the safety and efficacy of the SMILE regimen 
in patients with newly diagnosed stage IV and R/R 
ENKL-NT (n=38). A total of 28 patients (74%) 
completed the planned treatment in the phase II 
study, with an ORR and CR rate of 79% and 45%, 
respectively.32 Response rates were not different be-
tween previously untreated patients and those with 
relapsed disease. The 1-year PFS and OS rates were 
53% and 55%, respectively.32 Another phase II study 
from the Asia Lymphoma Study Group (n=87) also 
reported favorable outcomes with the SMILE regi-
men in patients with newly diagnosed and R/R 
ENKL-NT.33 The ORR was 81% (CR in 66%), and 
similar response rates were seen in both groups. At

a median follow-up of 31 months, 4-year DFS was 
64% and 5-year OS was 50%.
A modified SMILE regimen (a single dose of 
pegaspargase is substituted for 7 doses of L-asparaginase 
per cycle) was also shown to be active for the treat-
ment of ENKL.34,35 In a retrospective analysis of 43 
patients with ENKL-NT treated at a single institution 
(26 patients with early-stage disease received 2 cycles 
of chemotherapy followed by 45 Gy of involved-site 
RT [ISRT]; 17 patients with advanced-stage disease 
received 3 cycles of chemotherapy alone and ISRT to 
bulky disease sites), the modified SMILE regimen re-
sulted in a significantly higher CR rate than the accel-
erated-CHOP regimen (cyclophosphamide/doxorubi-
cin/vincristine/prednisone) (80% vs 30%; P=.015) 
and the 2-year OS (87% vs 21%) and PFS (56% vs 
18%) rates were significantly higher for patients with 
early-stage versus advanced-stage disease (P<.001) for 
the total cohort.35 Among 11 patients with early-stage 
disease treated with the modified SMILE regimen and 
45 Gy of ISRT, the estimated 2-year PFS rate was 83% 
and all patients were alive with no evidence of disease 
at the time of publication. 
Pegaspargase in combination with gemcitabine 
and oxaliplatin (P-GEMOX) with or without RT is 
also an effective treatment option for newly diagnosed 
and R/R disease.36,37 In a retrospective analysis of 117 
patients with ENKL (96 with newly diagnosed ENKL 
and 21 with R/R disease), the P-GEMOX regimen re-
sulted in an ORR of 88% and responses were similar 
for patients with newly diagnosed and R/R ENKL.36 
After a median follow-up of 17 months, 3-year OS 
and PFS rates were 73% and 58%, respectively. In a 
subgroup analysis, PFS was significantly better for pa-
tients with newly diagnosed ENKL than R/R disease, 
but there were no differences in OS. The AspaMet-
Dex regimen (L-asparaginase/methotrexate/dexa-
methasone) was evaluated in a phase II Intergroup 
study of 19 patients with R/R ENKL.13 After 3 cycles, 
patients with localized disease were treated with con-
solidative RT, if not received previously; those with 
disseminated disease received high-dose therapy with

peripheral blood stem cell infusion. The ORR and CR 
rate after 3 cycles of AspaMetDex were 78% and 61%, 
respectively. Median PFS and OS for both was 1 year; 
the absence of anti-asparaginase antibodies and the 
disappearance of serum EBV DNA were significantly 
associated with a better outcome.13 
Sandwich chemoradiation (2 cycles of chemo-
therapy followed by involved-field RT [56 Gy] fol-
lowed by 2–4 cycles of chemotherapy within 7 days 
of completion of involved-field RT) with asparagi-
nase- or pegaspargase-based chemotherapy has been 
shown to be effective for the treatment of patients 
with newly diagnosed stage I–II ENKL-NT.38–40 In a 
phase II study of 27 patients, sandwich chemoradia-
tion with GELOX (L-asparaginase/gemcitabine/ox-
aliplatin) resulted in an ORR of 96% (CR, 74%). Af-
ter a median follow-up of 63 months, 5-year OS and 
PFS rates were 85% and 74%, respectively. Grade 3 
or 4 toxicities were infrequent, and no treatment-
related deaths were reported.38 Sandwich chemo-
radiation with P-GEMOX is also effective for the 
treatment of patients with newly diagnosed ENKL 
(n=38), resulting in an ORR of 92% (CR, 87%). At 
a median follow-up of 15.5 months, the 1-year PFS 
and OS rates were both 87%.40 
Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
Autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) 
has been evaluated as a consolidation therapy for 
patients with early- and advanced-stage ENKL re-
sponding to primary therapy. In retrospective analy-
ses, disease status at the time of transplant was the 
most important prognostic factor for OS and relapse-
free survival.41–44 In a retrospective analysis of 62 pa-
tients with newly diagnosed ENKL who underwent 
autologous HCT after primary therapy, those with 
early-stage disease had significantly better 3-year 
PFS (64% vs 40%; P=.017) and OS (68% vs 52%; 
P=.048) than those with advanced disease.44 In the 
multivariate analysis, NK/T-cell prognostic index 
(for limited disease) and pretransplant response (for 
advanced-stage disease) were independent prog-
nostic factors for survival. In addition, RT was an 
independent prognostic factor for reduced progres-
sion and survival in patients with limited disease, 
and anthracycline-based chemotherapy was a poor 
prognostic factor for progression in patients with 
advanced disease. In a more recent report, pretrans-
plant response status assessed using the Deauville 
5-point scale (5PS) and the presence of detectable 
EBV DNA were identified as independent predictors 
of OS after autologous HCT.45 
Allogeneic HCT has also been evaluated in ret-
rospective studies predominantly involving Asian 
patients.42,46,47 The use of the SMILE regimen be-
fore HCT was the most important positive prognos-
tic indicator for superior OS and event-free survival 
(P<.01) in patients with stage IV ENKL at first CR 
or chemotherapy-sensitive R/R disease.47 In a more 
recent retrospective analysis from the Center for In-
ternational Blood and Marrow Transplant Research 
that evaluated allogeneic HCT in a predominantly 
Caucasian patient cohort, 3-year PFS and OS rates 
were 28% and 34%, respectively.48 Survival rates 
were similar regardless of the remission status before 
allogeneic HCT, suggesting that allogeneic HCT 
may be associated with a survival benefit even in the 
subset of patients with chemorefractory disease at 
time of transplant. In a retrospective analysis com-
paring treatment outcomes for autologous (n=60) 
versus allogeneic (n=74) HCT in patients with 
ENKL, the 2-year OS rate was significantly higher 
with autologous versus allogeneic HCT (69% vs 
41%). However, the type of transplant was not a sig-
nificant prognostic factor in multivariate analysis.49 
NCCN Recommendations
Participation in a clinical trial is the preferred option 
for all patients with ENKL with any stage disease. It 
is recommended that patients with ENKL be treated 
at centers with expertise in the management of this 
disease and, when possible, enrolled on clinical tri-
als. Because ENKLs are rare malignancies, random-
ized trials comparing different regimens have not 
yet been conducted and standard therapy has not 
yet been established for these patients. Treatment 
should be individualized based on patient’s tolerance 
and comorbidities. Retrospective comparative stud-
ies have shown that asparaginase- and pegaspargase-
based regimens are associated with superior efficacy 
compared with conventional anthracycline-based 
regimens for the treatment of stage I–II disease,50,51 
with pegaspargase-based regimens preferred. 
Induction Therapy 
RT alone is recommended for patients with stage I or 
II nasal disease who are unfit to undergo chemother-

apy (see NKTL-3; page 127). Patients with stage I or 
II nasal disease who are fit to receive chemotherapy 
can be treated with concurrent chemoradiation (RT, 
50 Gy, and 3 courses of DeVIC or RT, 40–52.8 Gy, 
and cisplatin followed by 3 cycles of VIPD) or se-
quential chemoradiation (modified SMILE followed 
by RT, 45–50.4 Gy) or sandwich chemoradiation (2 
cycles of P-GEMOX followed by RT, 56 Gy, followed 
by 2–4 cycles of P-GEMOX). 
ISRT is recommended as the appropriate field 
because it limits the volume of RT to the region of 
involvement only.52 An ISRT dose of 50 to 55 Gy 
is recommended when used alone as primary treat-
ment and 45 to 50.4 Gy is recommended when used 
in combination with chemotherapy. When ISRT is 
used alone, the clinical target volume (CTV) should 
encompass the involved region as defined by MRI 
and CT, with expansions to include any of the sinus-
es that were partially involved initially, all adjacent 
paranasal sinuses, and a 0.5- to 1.0-cm expansion 
into soft tissue.52 In instances when chemotherapy 
was given before ISRT and has produced a CR, the 
CTV should include at least the prechemotherapy 
gross tumor volume with appropriate margins (0.5–
1.0 cm).
Patients with stage IV nasal disease and those 
with extranasal disease (stage I–IV) can be treated 
with pegaspargase-based combination chemotherapy 
(AspaMetDex, modified SMILE, or P-GEMOX regi-
men) with or without RT, or concurrent chemora-
diation (RT, 50 Gy, and 3 courses of DeVIC, or con-
current RT, 40–52.8 Gy, and cisplatin followed by 
3 cycles of VIPD). Pegaspargase-based combination 
chemotherapy alone may be appropriate for selected 
patients who are not eligible to receive RT. The P-
GEMOX regimen is an option for patients who can-
not tolerate intense chemotherapy.
Response Assessment and Additional Therapy
End-of-treatment evaluation after induction therapy 
should include appropriate imaging studies (CT, MRI, 
PET/CT) based on the type of imaging performed at 
the initial workup, endoscopy with visual inspection, 
repeat biopsies, and measurement of EBV DNA (see 
NKTL-4; page 128). Recent reports from retrospec-
tive studies suggest that posttreatment PET/CT using 
the Deauville 5PS may be a valuable tool for response 
assessment in patients with newly diagnosed and R/R 
disease.53–55 In a retrospective analysis of 102 patients 
with newly diagnosed ENKL, Deauville 5PS and EBV 
DNA after completion of initial treatment were in-
dependently associated with PFS and OS in the mul-
tivariable analysis.54 Given the primarily extranodal 
sites of involvement often outside of the chest, abdo-
men, and pelvis, PET/CT is also preferred for follow-
up to better assess these sites. 
Patients with stage I or II nasal disease achieving 
a CR to induction therapy may be observed without 
further treatment. A CR should also include negative 
findings on ear, nose, and throat evaluation. Biopsy 
is recommended for patients with a PR after induc-
tion therapy, and those with a negative biopsy may 
be observed without further treatment. Patients with 
a positive biopsy should be managed as described in 
the following section for refractory disease.
Patients with stage IV nasal disease or extra-
nasal disease (stage I–IV) experiencing a CR to in-
duction therapy should be considered for HCT. No 
clear data suggest whether allogeneic or autologous 
HCT is preferred, and therefore treatment should 
be individualized.49 Biopsy is recommended for pa-
tients with a PR after induction therapy, and those 
with negative biopsy results should be considered for 
HCT. Patients with positive biopsy results should be 
managed as described in the following section for re-
fractory disease.
R/R Disease 
Second-line therapy with pegaspargase-based com-
bination chemotherapy, as described for induction 
therapy, may offer benefit for patients with refractory 
disease (nasal or extranasal, and regardless of disease 
stage). A clinical trial or best supportive care are 
also included as options for refractory disease with 
no response to induction therapy (see NKTL-4; page 
128). 
A clinical trial is the preferred treatment option 
for patients with R/R disease after treatment with 
pegaspargase-based regimens. Pembrolizumab, an 
anti–programmed death-1 antibody, has been shown 
to induce high response rates in patients with R/R 
ENKL after treatment with asparaginase-based regi-
mens.56 Pembrolizumab is an appropriate option in 
the absence of a clinical trial. Only limited data exist 
regarding the role of HCT in this patient population. 
Allogeneic HCT is preferred if a donor is available.
