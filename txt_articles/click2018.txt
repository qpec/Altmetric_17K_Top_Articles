IMPORTANCE Individuals with adenomatous polyps are advised to undergo repeated
colonoscopy surveillance to prevent subsequent colorectal cancer (CRC), but the relationship
between adenomas at colonoscopy and long-term CRC incidence is unclear.
OBJECTIVE To compare long-term CRC incidence by colonoscopy adenoma findings.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, prospective cohort study of participants in
the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer randomized clinical trial of flexible
sigmoidoscopy (FSG) beginning in 1993 with follow-up for CRC incidence to 2013 across the
United States. Participants included 154 900 men and women aged 55 to 74 years enrolled in
PLCO of whom 15 935 underwent colonoscopy following their first positive FSG screening
result. The final day of follow-up was December 31, 2013.
EXPOSURES Enrolled participants had been randomized to FSG or usual care. Participants
who underwent FSG and had abnormal findings were referred for follow-up. Subsequent
colonoscopy findings were categorized as advanced adenoma (�1 cm, high-grade dysplasia,
or tubulovillous or villous histology), nonadvanced adenoma (<1 cm without advanced
histology), or no adenoma.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was CRC incidence within 15 years of
the baseline colonoscopy. The secondary outcome was CRC mortality.
RESULTS There were 15 935 participants who underwent colonoscopy (men, 59.7%; white,
90.7%; median age, 64 y [IQR, 61-68]). On initial colonoscopy, 2882 participants (18.1%) had
an advanced adenoma, 5068 participants (31.8%) had a nonadvanced adenoma, and 7985
participants (50.1%) had no adenoma; median follow-up for CRC incidence was 12.9 years.
CRC incidence rates per 10 000 person-years of observation were 20.0 (95% CI, 15.3-24.7;
n = 70) for advanced adenoma, 9.1 (95% CI, 6.7-11.5; n = 55) for nonadvanced adenoma, and
7.5 (95% CI, 5.8-9.7; n = 71) for no adenoma. Participants with advanced adenoma were
significantly more likely to develop CRC compared with participants with no adenoma (rate
ratio [RR], 2.7 [95% CI, 1.9-3.7]; P < .001). There was no significant difference in CRC risk
between participants with nonadvanced adenoma compared with no adenoma (RR, 1.2 [95%
CI, 0.8-1.7]; P = .30). Compared with participants with no adenoma, those with advanced
adenoma were at significantly increased risk of CRC death (RR, 2.6 [95% CI, 1.2-5.7], P = .01),
but mortality risk in participants with nonadvanced adenoma was not significantly different
(RR, 1.2 [95% CI, 0.5-2.7], P = .68).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Over a median of 13 years of follow-up, participants with an
advanced adenoma at diagnostic colonoscopy prompted by a positive flexible sigmoidoscopy
result were at significantly increased risk of developing colorectal cancer compared with
those with no adenoma. Identification of nonadvanced adenoma may not be associated
with increased colorectal cancer risk.

 O
bservational studies and randomized trials of endo-
scopic screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) with colo-
noscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy demonstrate a sig-
nificant reduction in CRC incidence and mortality.1-7 The
reduction in incidence is due to the removal of the precursor
lesion of colorectal cancer, the adenomatous polyp.1-3,5,6,8
Adenomatous polyps occur in about one-third of pa-
tients undergoing screening colonoscopy.9 To prevent sub-
sequent cancer after the removal of adenomatous polyps,
individuals are advised to undergo periodic colonoscopy sur-
veillance with the timing determined by the number of ad-
enomas and whether they were advanced by size or histol-
ogy. International guidelines for the timing and frequency of
colonoscopy surveillance vary and have weak supporting
evidence.10Individualswithadvancedadenomas(≥1cm,high-
grade dysplasia, or villous or tubulovillous histology) are ad-
vised to return in 3 years.11 In the United States, individuals
with 1 to 2 nonadvanced adenomas (<1 cm and no high-grade
dysplasia or villous or tubulovillous histology), the most com-
mon preneoplastic finding, are advised to return in 5 to 10
years, but evidence to inform guidelines for who should re-
turn at 5 as opposed to 10 years is lacking. The timing for sur-
veillance colonoscopy should be based on the ensuing risk of
developing CRC, but few studies have examined CRC inci-
dence after adenoma removal.12-15
The relationship between adenoma findings on diagnos-
tic colonoscopy prompted by a positive flexible sigmoidos-
copy (FSG) screening result and long-term risk of CRC inci-
dence was examined in participants in the Prostate, Lung,
Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.
Methods
Study Population and Design
This study was a prospective cohort study of participants
enrolled in the multicenter, randomized PLCO Cancer
Screening Trial of FSG. The trial enrolled 154 900 men and
women aged 55 to 74 years between 1993 and 2001. Individu-
als were randomized to receive FSG at baseline and again at
year 3 (for those randomized before April 1995) or year 5 vs
usual care. Participants who had a positive FSG result (find-
ings of a polyp or mass) did not have the polyps removed but
were referred to their primary care physicians for decisions
regarding diagnostic follow-up, about 75% of whom under-
went colonoscopy.16 Details of the trial have been previously
published.2,17 Each participating center's institutional review
board approved the protocol and all study participants pro-
vided written informed consent. The PLCO trial protocol and
statistical analysis plan are available in Supplement 1.
Definition of Exposure and Study Cohort
For this study, participants who had a positive FSG result at
the baseline (time zero [T0]) or the year 3 or 5 (time 3 y or time
5 y [T3 or T5]) examination and had a diagnostic colonoscopy
within 1 year of the FSG were included. Medical records re-
lated to follow-up were collected and abstracted in a standard-
ized fashion including polyp size, number, and histology.
Pathologic findings were abstracted from local pathologic re-
ports; specimens were not reviewed centrally. The number,
size, and histologic characteristics of lesions detected at the
colonoscopy were ascertained and categorized hierarchically
in accordance with current US guidelines as (1) advanced ad-
enoma (any adenoma ≥1 cm, high-grade dysplasia, or with tu-
bulovillous or villous histology); (2) nonadvanced adenoma
(adenomas <1 cm without advanced histology); or (3) no ad-
enoma. Within the nonadvanced adenoma category, partici-
pants were subcategorized as 1 to 2 adenomas or 3 adenomas
or more.11
Lesions in the rectum through the splenic flexure were de-
fined as distal and those in the transverse colon to the cecum
were defined as proximal. Colonoscopy preparation and cecal
intubation were abstracted on the report forms. If the colonos-
copy preparation was designated as inadequate or if the ce-
cum was not visualized, the examination was classified as in-
adequate. If the preparation quality was not reported but the
cecum was visualized, the colonoscopy examination was con-
sidered adequate. Baseline participant demographics includ-
ingage,bodymassindex,andsmokingstatusatenrollment,sex,
participant-identified fixed-category race, family history of
cancer(s), and aspirin or ibuprofen use were recorded as these
factors are known to influence colonic neoplastic risk.18-24
The primary exclusion criteria were a history of prostate,
lung,colorectal,orovariancancerorongoingtreatmentforany
type of cancer except basal or squamous-cell skin cancer. Be-
ginning in 1995, participants with a colonoscopy, FSG, or
barium enema within the prior 3 years were ineligible. Partici-
pants who underwent a colonoscopy within a year of the first
positive FSG result and were diagnosed with colorectal can-
cer within 2 months of the colonoscopy were excluded.
Definition of Outcomes
The primary outcome was colorectal cancer incidence and the
secondary outcome was colorectal cancer mortality. Incident
cancers and deaths were ascertained primarily by an active,
trial-led process that involved mailing annual study update
questionnairestoparticipants,obtainingandabstractingmedi-
cal records pertaining to cancer using certified tumor regis-
trars, and obtaining death certificates to confirm mortality.
Key Points
Question Is there a significant difference in subsequent colorectal
cancer (CRC) incidence between individuals with either advanced or
nonadvanced adenomas compared with those with no adenomas?
Findings In this prospective cohort study that included 15 935
participants undergoing colonoscopy following an abnormal
flexible sigmoidoscopy screening with a median follow-up of
13 years, the CRC incidence per 10 000 person-years was 20.0 for
baseline advanced adenoma, 9.1 for nonadvanced adenoma, and
7.5 for no adenoma. The difference compared with no adenoma
was statistically significant for advanced adenoma but not for
nonadvanced adenoma.
Meaning Identification of advanced adenoma was associated
with increased risk for subsequent CRC incidence; nonadvanced
adenoma may not be associated with increased risk.

 Starting in 2011, the trial switched to a centralized follow-up
system that utilized passive linkages to state cancer registries
to assess cancer incidence and linkages to the National Death
Index to assess mortality. Some participants declined to be re-
consented and thus opted out of extended follow-up. Partici-
pants who consented for extended follow-up (85.0% of those
alive in 2011) were followed up for CRC incidence through the
end of 2013 and for mortality through the end of 2012; those
who declined were followed for incidence until December 31,
2009, and for mortality until their date of opting out (gener-
allyin2011).Thefinaldateoffollow-upwasDecember31,2013.
Therefore, for those who declined, deaths and incident CRC
cases were ascertained solely by the active process, and for
consenters, deaths and cases were ascertained by the active
process through the end of 2009 and through passive link-
ages after that (with some overlap during 2010-2011). Cause
of death was reviewed blinded to study group and catego-
rized as due to colorectal cancer in a formal adjudication pro-
cess until 2009 and by death certificate or National Death
Index-linked records after 2009.25,26
Statistical Methods
Categorical variables were compared using χ2 or Fisher exact
test when appropriate. Continuous variables were compared
using Wilcoxon rank sum testing for pairwise comparisons or
Kruskal-Wallis for multiple comparisons.
Follow-upforCRCincidenceandmortalitybegan2months
from the date of participants’ colonoscopy. CRC incidence and
mortality rates were computed for the period within 15 years
of the start of follow-up as incident CRC cases or deaths di-
videdbyperson-yearsofobservation;ratesweresimilarlycom-
putedforotherobservationperiods(eg,within10years,within
5 years). Cumulative CRC incidence through 15 years was com-
puted using Kaplan-Meier curves. Participants without CRC
were censored at the end of follow-up.
Colorectalincidenceandmortalityforparticipantswithad-
vanced adenoma, nonadvanced adenoma, and no adenoma
were compared using rate ratios with corresponding 95% CIs.
The referent was the no adenoma group unless otherwise
stated. Additionally, Poisson regression models for colorectal

tus and variables previously shown to be associated with out-
comesincludingage,sex,regularaspirinoribuprofenuse,base-
line vs postbaseline status of the initial colonoscopy, as well
as the timing of the initial diagnostic colonoscopy. Response
rate to baseline questionnaire items (race, family history, body
mass index, aspirin or ibuprofen use, smoking status, prior
lower endoscopy) ranged from 98.3% to 99.3%. A dummy vari-
able was used for missing data on aspirin or ibuprofen use.
Model goodness of fit was assessed using χ2 tests on model de-
viance. All tests were 2-sided and significance was consid-
ered at an α of .05, unless otherwise stated. All analyses were
performed using SAS software (SAS Institute), version 9.3.
Subgroup Analyses
Participants With a Negative Screening Result
To be included in the no adenoma group, participants had to
have an initial positive FSG result but no findings or nonad-
enomatous findings at subsequent colonoscopy. To evaluate
the representativeness of the no adenoma group, distal CRC
incidence in the no adenoma group was compared with par-
ticipants with a negative, adequate, initial FSG result. The
analysis was restricted to the distal colon because partici-
pants with a negative baseline screening result could have
had undetected proximal disease. To account for time from
initial FSG screen to subsequent colonoscopy and ensure
comparability between negative and positive FSG result
groups, CRC follow-up began at 133 days from the negative
FSG result, where 133 days represented the median interval
from FSG screen to colonoscopy for participants in the no
adenoma group. CRC incidence rates were computed simi-
larly as for the primary analysis.
Analysis of Subsequent Colonoscopy
In participants with adenomas, repeat colonoscopy after ini-
tial colonoscopy could have affected the subsequent inci-
dence of CRC. The trial did not routinely collect information
on utilization or yield of surveillance colonoscopy. However,
an ancillary study of colonoscopy utilization conducted in
2005-200727,28 collected such information in a randomly se-
lected subset of participants (n = 3492, 21.9% of current study
cohort). In the study of colonoscopy utilization, participants
whose first positive screening result was in T3 or T5 were ex-
cluded. Otherwise, the eligibility criteria were having a posi-
tive initial FSG result and a follow-up colonoscopy, similar to
the current study. In the study of colonoscopy utilization, par-
ticipants with advanced adenomas were oversampled.
Participants were interviewed by phone about colonoscopy
use, and confirmatory medical records of colonoscopy exami-
nations including the indication and pathology reports were
obtained and abstracted. The proportion of participants with
advanced adenoma, nonadvanced adenoma, and no ad-
enoma who underwent subsequent colonoscopy and the re-
moval of adenoma for each of these groups was determined.

derwent repeat screening at T3 or T5 or whose initial screen
was at T3 or T5, 6929 (19.4%) had a positive result and 5556
(80.2%) underwent colonoscopy within 1 year. In total, 16 162
participants had follow-up with diagnostic colonoscopy
prompted by FSG screening. There were 217 cases of CRC di-
agnosed with colonoscopy and these participants were ex-
cluded. Ten participants had no follow-up time and were
excluded, resulting in 15 935 included (Figure 1).

ticipants (24.4%) had advanced histology (114 [16.2%] with
high-grade dysplasia and 590 participants [83.8%] had vil-

enoma group, 572 participants (11.3%) had 3 or more nonad-
vanced adenomas and 4496 participants (88.7%) had 1 to 2
nonadvanced adenoma(s). Those with any adenomas were
more likely to be men (Table 1). Aspirin or ibuprofen use, fam-
ily history of CRC, smoking status, body mass index, and race
did not differ by adenoma status. Overall median follow-up for
CRC incidence was 12.9 years with 13.6, 13.1, and 12.5 years for
advanced adenoma, nonadvanced adenoma, and no ad-
enoma, respectively. The proportion of each group who de-
clined extended follow-up ranged from 9.5% to 9.8% with no
significant difference between adenoma groups (eTable 1 in
Supplement 2). Those who declined extended follow-up were
significantly younger, women, and white and had an overall
median follow-up of 11.1 years compared with 13.2 years for
those who agreed to extended follow-up.
CRC Incidence by Adenoma Group
Through the end of follow-up, there were a total of 196 CRC
cases: 70 in the advanced adenoma group; 55 in the nonad-
vanced adenoma group; and 71 in the no adenoma group. In-
cidence rates per 10 000 person-years were 20.0 (95% CI, 15.3
to 24.7) in the advanced adenoma group, 9.1 (95% CI, 6.7 to

(95% CI, 1.0% to 1.6%) in the no adenoma group (Figure 2). Ab-
solute differences were 1.7% (95% CI, 0.9% to 2.4%; P < .001)
for advanced adenoma vs no adenoma, 0.2% (95% CI, −0.3%

and 1.5% (95% CI, 0.7% to 2.3%; P < .001) for advanced ad-

Within the advanced adenoma category, there was no sig-
nificant difference in incidence rate per 10 000 person-years
between those with adenomas of 1 cm or larger vs those with
adenomas less than 1 cm but with advanced histology (19.2

for <1 cm , P = .58; rate difference, 3.2 [95% CI, −8.3 to 14.4])
(Table 2). Within advanced adenoma less than 1 cm, there was
no significant difference in CRC incidence per 10 000 person-
years between high-grade dysplasia and villous or tubulovil-
lous histology (28.6 [95% CI, 0.6 to 56.6] for high-grade dys-
plasia vs 21.1 [95% CI, 10.4 to 31.8] for villous or tubulovillous
histology, P = .59; rate difference, 7.5 [95% CI, −22.5 to 37.5]).
In the advanced adenoma group, there was no significant
difference in CRC risk between years 5 to 10 compared with
years 0 to 5 (rate ratio [RR], 1.2 [95% CI, 0.7 to 2.0]; P = .49;
rate difference, 3.9 [95% CI, −7.2 to 15.0]). There was no sig-
nificant difference between participants with 3 or more non-
advancedadenomasandthosewithnoadenomas(RR,1.4[95%
CI,0.6to3.0],P = .44;ratedifference,2.7[95%CI,−5.1to10.5]).
Multiple Poisson regression analysis demonstrated a sig-
nificantly increased risk of CRC in advanced adenoma com-
pared with no adenoma participants (RR, 2.6 [95% CI, 1.9 to
3.7]; P < .001) (Table 3). There was no significant difference be-
tween nonadvanced adenoma and no adenoma (RR, 1.2 [95%

higher CRC risk compared with those with 1 to 2 nonad-
vanced adenoma(s) (RR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.4 to 2.4]; P = .98). Lim-

Of the 196 CRC cases, the majority (59%) were proximal,
whereas 16 (8%) were in an unknown location. Compared with
distal advanced adenoma, participants with a proximal ad-
vanced adenoma at the index colonoscopy were at signifi-
cantly greater overall risk for subsequent CRC (RR, 2.6 [95%
CI, 1.6 to 4.3]; P < .001; rate difference, 23.9 [95% CI, 7.9 to

tion was not significantly associated with subsequent CRC lo-
cation;proximalCRCcomprised54%(19of35)ofcasesinthose

those with proximal advanced adenomas (P = .06). Among
those with 1 to 2 nonadvanced adenomas, there was no sig-
nificant association between initial nonadvanced adenoma lo-
cation and risk for CRC (RR, 1.5 [95% CI, 0.7 to 2.8]; P = .24;
rate difference, 3.8 [95% CI, −3.1 to 10.7]) for proximal only vs
distal only adenoma location. There was also no significant as-
sociation between nonadvanced adenoma location and sub-
sequent CRC location, with proximal CRC comprising 57%
(16 of 28) and 62% (8 of 13) of CRC cases in those with distal
adenomas and proximal adenomas, respectively (P = .79)
(eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
The majority (56.6%) of CRC detected was stage I or II,
whereas 32.7% were stage III or IV and 10.7% were unknown
(eTable 3 in Supplement 2). There was no significant differ-
ence in stage I or II CRC by adenoma group (advanced ad-
enoma, 60% [42 of 70 cases]; nonadvanced adenoma, 54.5%
[30 of 55 cases]; no adenoma, 54.9% [39 of 71 cases]; P = .78)

enoma, 33.8% [24 of 71 cases]; P = .96).
Within the no adenoma group, there were 4410 (55.2%)
participants with hyperplastic polyp(s) or other nonadenoma-
tous lesion(s) and 3575 (44.8%) participants with no polyp
findings on follow-up colonoscopy. There were 42 CRC cases

Subsequent Colonoscopy Utilization and Findings
Of 3561 participants in the study of colonoscopy utilization,
3492 (98.1%) were included in the current study, with a me-
dian length of follow-up after index colonoscopy of 9.0 years.
Subsequent colonoscopy utilization was significantly higher
in the advanced adenoma compared with both nonadvanced
adenoma and no adenoma (82.5% for advanced adenoma vs
78.7% for nonadvanced adenoma [P = .008] vs 69.9% for no
adenoma [P < .001]), although the 3 or more nonadvanced ad-
enomas group had the highest proportion of subsequent colo-
noscopy (83.0%) during the 9-year period (Table 4). Only a
small percentage of subsequent colonoscopies were for symp-
toms (advanced adenoma, 10.6%; nonadvanced adenoma,
14.0%; no adenoma, 19.4%) during the 9-year follow-up pe-

moval (13.0% for advanced adenoma vs 7.6% for nonad-
vancedadenoma[P < .001]vs4.8%fornoadenoma[P < .001]).
Compared with the no adenoma group, participants with 1 to
2 nonadvanced adenoma(s) had an 8.2% higher frequency of
subsequent colonoscopy (78.1% for the nonadvanced ad-

Colorectal Cancer Mortality
Through the end of the follow-up period there were 36 deaths
from CRC (13 advanced adenoma, 10 nonadvanced adenoma,
13 no adenoma) (Table 3). Compared with participants with no

Discussion
This post hoc follow-up of a randomized clinical trial of flex-
ible sigmoidoscopy for a median observation time of 13 years
demonstrates that participants with an advanced adenoma
detected at colonoscopy were at significantly increased risk
of subsequent colorectal cancer compared with those with no
adenoma. Participants with nonadvanced adenoma did not
have a significantly different CRC risk compared with those
with no adenoma.
The risk in participants with advanced adenoma was un-
likely to be due to partial removal of the initial lesion, as the
risk in the first 5 years was not significantly different from risk
between years 5 through 10. These data are consistent with
studies that demonstrate increased CRC risk in patients with
a history of an advanced adenoma.12,29-31 However, these data
show a higher risk than that observed in a Norwegian study13
of colorectal cancer mortality in patients with a high-risk ad-
enoma(standardizedmortalityratio,1.16[95%CI,1.02to1.31]).
Other studies have demonstrated that finding an advanced ad-
enoma on colonoscopy significantly increases the risk of find-
ing an advanced adenoma on subsequent colonoscopy com-
paredwiththosewithnoadenoma.18,27,30,32-36Thecurrentdata
provide long-term assessment of incident CRC risk in a large
population in comparison with a control group of nonad-
vanced and no adenoma. By demonstrating that individuals
diagnosed with an advanced adenoma are at increased long-
term risk for subsequent incident CRC, these findings sup-
port periodic, ongoing surveillance colonoscopy in these pa-
tients. Data from the United Kingdom in participants with
advanced adenomas demonstrated a cumulative CRC inci-
dence of 1.8% (210 cases of 11944 participants) after median
follow-up of 7.9 years, similar to the current observed inci-
dence of 1.9% (56 cases of 2882 participants) through 10 years
offollow-up.Furthermore,intheUKstudy,14surveillancecolo-
noscopy was associated with a 50% to 60% reduction in sub-
sequent CRC incidence. In the current study, proximal ad-
vanced adenoma location was significantly associated with
overall subsequent CRC risk compared with distal advanced
adenoma location.
TherewasnosignificantdifferenceinCRCincidenceinpar-
ticipants with advanced adenoma, whether the adenoma was
1 cm or larger or smaller than 1 cm with advanced histology.
Europeanguidelinesoffertheoptionofreturningpatientswith
an adenoma smaller than 1 cm with advanced histology to a
low-risk group with a standard 10-year surveillance interval.10
The current data suggest this group is not significantly differ-
ent in risk compared with those with a large adenoma and
therefore they should continue to be followed with more fre-
quent surveillance.
Participants with 1 to 2 nonadvanced adenoma(s) were not

those with no adenoma. However, the 95% CIs are wide and
may include a potentially clinically important effect size (RR:

 limited power to detect a significant difference. Further-
more, increased surveillance colonoscopy use and additional
adenoma and advanced adenoma removal among partici-
pants with 1 to 2 nonadvanced adenoma compared with those
with no adenoma in the follow-up period could have contrib-
uted to a lower cancer incidence rate in participants with 1 to
2 nonadvanced adenomas. However, the difference in colo-
noscopyuse(8.2%)andadenomaremoval(10.8%)betweenthe
nonadvancedadenomaandthenoadenomagroupswassmall.
Current US guidelines recommend a colonoscopy
follow-up interval of 5 to 10 years for patients with 1 to 2 non-
advanced adenoma(s),11 but the decision between 5 and 10
years is often left to physician discretion and evidence-based
recommendations are unavailable.10 Individuals with no
adenomatous findings on colonoscopy are advised to return
in 10 years. If appropriately powered prospective trials were
to replicate these findings demonstrating no significant dif-
ference in cancer incidence between participants with 1 to 2
nonadvanced adenoma(s) and no adenomas, colonoscopy
use could be reduced by a large extent, as a surveillance
examination at 5 years would not be needed. Small nonad-
vanced adenomas are the most common neoplastic finding
on colonoscopy—occurring in about 30% of patients.9,37 The
European Polyp Surveillance randomized clinical trial (EPoS,
NCT02319928) is randomizing participants with 1 to 2 nonad-
vanced adenoma(s) to surveillance at 5 and 10 years vs sur-
veillance at 10 years to determine if surveillance at 5 years
will reduce CRC incidence and a similar type trial, FORTE, is
in the planning stages in the United States.38
Participants with 3 or more adenomas are considered
higher risk than those with 1 to 2 nonadvanced adenoma(s),
and guidelines advise repeat colonoscopy examination in 3
years. In the current study, there was no significant differ-
ence in cancer incidence when comparing those with 3 or more
adenomas to those with 1 to 2 nonadvanced adenoma(s), but
the number of patients with 3 or more adenomas was small re-
sulting in estimates with wide CIs that did not provide ad-
equate guidance. Furthermore, subsequent colonoscopy was
highly utilized in patients with 3 or more adenomas.
There are several strengths of the current study. It in-
cluded participants cared for throughout the United States in
a variety of practice settings and is thus representative of stan-
dard practice. Use of surveillance colonoscopy was tracked for
21.9% of the sample, so the effect of additional colonoscopy
examinations could be estimated. The cohort was closely fol-
lowed for CRC incidence with few lost to follow-up. Overall
compliance with the annual study update was 93.8%.2
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the colonoscopy ex-
aminationfollowedanabnormalorpositiveFSGresult.Assuch,
participants in the no adenoma group may not be representa-
tive of individuals with a negative initial colonoscopy result.
However, distal and overall CRC incidence in participants with
a negative FSG result were not statistically significantly dif-
ferent from those with a positive FSG result but no adenoma-
tous findings on subsequent colonoscopy. Additionally, in the
group with an abnormal sigmoidoscopy but no adenoma at
follow-upcolonoscopy,CRCincidencewasnotsignificantlydif-
ferent among those with hyperplastic polyps or nonadenoma-
tous lesion(s) compared with those with no findings.
Second, although most participants (88.6%) had not had
a lower gastrointestinal endoscopy in the 3 years prior to en-
rollment,informationonpreviousexaminationswasnotavail-
able. Thus, some participants may have had lower gastroin-
testinal endoscopy and removal of adenomas prior to
enrollment in the trial that was not accounted for. However,
the cohort was followed for up to 15 years, ample time for CRC
risk to emerge. Third, colonoscopy follow-up was not stan-
dardized following the initial examination, was not uniform
across adenoma groups, and data on subsequent colonos-
copy use was only available for a minority of the study popu-
lation. Fourth, limited data on the quality of colonoscopy was
available; for example, endoscopists’ adenoma detection rates
were not available, but restricting the analysis to participants
with adequate colonoscopy preparation and confirmed cecal
intubation did not affect the results. Fifth, pathology was not
centrally reviewed, although this could be a strength because
these assessments reflect real-world interpretations. Sixth, en-
doscopic procedures and pathologic assessments were per-
formed from 1993 to 2006, and whether those findings are di-
rectly applicable to current techniques cannot be known with
certainty. Seventh, this study was a post hoc analysis with lim-
ited statistical power.
Conclusions
Over a median of 13 years of follow-up, participants with an
advanced adenoma at diagnostic colonoscopy prompted by a
positive screening flexible sigmoidoscopy result were at sig-
nificantly increased risk of developing colorectal cancer com-
pared with those with no adenoma. Identification of nonad-
vanced adenoma may not be associated with increased
colorectal cancer risk.
