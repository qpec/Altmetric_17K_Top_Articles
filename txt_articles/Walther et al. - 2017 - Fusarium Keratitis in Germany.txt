ABSTRACT
Fusarium keratitis is a destructive eye infection that is difficult to treat
and results in poor outcome. In tropical and subtropical areas, the infection is rela-
tively common and associated with trauma or chronic eye diseases. However, in re-
cent years, an increased incidence has been reported in temperate climate regions.
At the German National Reference Center, we have observed a steady increase in
case numbers since 2014. Here, we present the first German case series of eye infec-
tions with Fusarium species. We identified Fusarium isolates from the eye or eye-
related material from 22 patients in 2014 and 2015. Thirteen isolates belonged to
the Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC), 6 isolates belonged to the Fusarium
oxysporum species complex (FOSC), and three isolates belonged to the Fusarium
fujikuroi species complex (FFSC). FSSC was isolated in 13 of 15 (85%) definite in-
fections and FOSC in 3 of 4 (75%) definite contaminations. Furthermore, diagno-
sis from contact lens swabs or a culture of contact lens solution turned out to
be highly unreliable. FSSC isolates differed from FOSC and FFSC by a distinctly
higher MIC for terbinafine. Outcome was often adverse, with 10 patients requir-
ing keratoplasty or enucleation. The use of natamycin as the most effective
agent against keratitis caused by filamentous fungi was rare in Germany, possi-
bly due to restricted availability. Keratitis caused by Fusarium spp. (usually FSSC)
appears to be a relevant clinical problem in Germany, with the use of contact
lenses as the predominant risk factor. Its outcome is often adverse.

K
eratitis caused by Fusarium species is a sight-threatening disease often affecting
otherwise-healthy patients. The infection is difficult to treat because Fusarium spp.
are highly resistant to most antifungals. Thus, in many cases, corneal infection will
progress to endophthalmitis (1), resulting in poor visual outcome and, in some cases,
in enucleation (2, 3). Risk factors for the development of eye infections caused by
Fusarium spp. include contact lens wear, trauma (4, 5), including surgery (2), and
immunosuppressive disease or medication (6).
Fusarium eye infections are more common in tropical and subtropical countries. In
these countries, defects in the epithelium of the cornea caused by trauma, often
involving plant material, are the main risk factor for Fusarium keratitis (5, 7, 8). However,
with the increasing use of contact lenses, Fusarium keratitis has also become a problem
in urban areas with moderate climates. In 2005 to 2006, an international outbreak of
contact lens-associated Fusarium keratitis was observed. This was a result of decreased

 activity of the antimicrobial agent alexidine against Fusarium spp. after heating the
cleaning solution ReNu with MoistureLoc (Bausch & Lomb) (9). The highest numbers of
cases were noted in Hong Kong (10), Singapore (11), and the United States (12, 13), but
European cases also associated with the ReNu WML solution have been reported
(14–17). Independent of this outbreak, a general increase in fungal keratitis cases has
been observed recently in countries with temperate climates, mostly due to an increase
in keratitis caused by filamentous fungi (18), probably associated with the use of
contact lenses.
Epidemiological analyses are hampered not only by a lack of clinical data but also
by the fact that the taxonomy of the genus Fusarium is in a state of flux. Closely related
species that share a similar morphology are combined in 20 species complexes (19). Eye
infections are predominantly caused by members of the Fusarium solani species
complex (FSSC) (20). Since morphological characteristics do not reliably differentiate
the sibling species, molecular identification based on the translation elongation factor
1� (TEF-1 alpha) has been used as an appropriate method for species identification (20).
Resistance to most antifungals makes the treatment of Fusarium infections very
difficult. They are intrinsically resistant against echinocandins (21, 22), and some species
show high MICs for azoles, while differences in the response to azoles have been
reported, depending on the taxa (23).
The National Reference Center for Invasive Fungal Infection (NRZMyk) serves as a
national reference laboratory for the diagnosis of fungal infections in Germany. Be-
tween January 2014 and December 2015, the NRZMyk received 24 Fusarium isolates
from 22 patients with ocular infections. The aim of the study was to perform a detailed
analysis of these cases to address the following questions: what are the risk factors for
acquiring Fusarium keratitis in Germany? Which Fusarium species cause these infec-
tions? Are there differences among the species concerning the in vitro antifungal
susceptibility profile, response to treatment, and virulence?
RESULTS
Patient characteristics. Twenty-four Fusarium strains from 22 patients (two cases
had two identical isolates at different sampling times) isolated from the eye or related
material were sent to the NRZMyk from 13 institutions all over Germany (Table 1). Most
patients (18/22) were female, and the median age was 46 years (interquartile range
[IQR], 26 to 56 years). The clinical specimen from which Fusarium was isolated was most
commonly a corneal swab (9 patients) or contact lens/contact lens disinfectant solution
(8 patients). The remaining patients had more invasive diagnostic procedures, with
corneal scraping in one case, biopsy of the vitreous body in 2 cases, and anterior
chamber puncture in one case. In one case, the exact origin of the specimen was not
further specified.
Fifteen patients clearly had fungal keratitis or endophthalmitis and are therefore
considered “cases” and described more thoroughly (Table 2). There were 4 patients
with either no symptoms at all (one patient) or rapid improvement without antifungal
treatment (3 patients). These were thus summarized as “contamination” (Table 3). In 3
patients, there was not sufficient clinical information to fully judge the clinical relevance
of the isolation of Fusarium spp.; these are therefore termed “cases with unknown
clinical relevance”(Table 4). However, all of these cases with unknown clinical relevance
had Fusarium spp. isolated from a contact lens or contact lens disinfection solution
only, whereas more representative material, like corneal swabs/scrapings, showed no
evidence of Fusarium species. It is thus very likely that they also represent contamina-
tions.
Characteristics and clinical course of confirmed cases. Among patients with
fungal keratitis/endophthalmitis, 11 were female and 4 were male, and median age was
50 years (IQR, 26 to 58 years). Fusarium spp. were mostly isolated from the cornea
(swabs/scrapings in 10 cases) but also from the anterior chamber (two cases) and the
vitreous body (one case) (Table 2). In one case, the strain was grown from contact lens
disinfectant solution, and in another case, the precise origin remains unknown. Ocular

 involvement was limited to keratitis in 4 patients but had extended to intraocular
structures (endophthalmitis) in 10 patients (unknown in 1 patient). None of the patients
had reported major trauma or immunosuppression (including the use of steroids).
Eleven patients used contact lenses; however, in one case of Fusarium falciforme
infection, there was no history of contact lens use, and in 3 cases, no information was
available. Of those with contact lens use, at least 7 wore soft contact lenses (unknown
for the remaining patients). Six patients reported working in the garden or with
livestock at the time of infection (unknown in the remaining 9 cases).
At least 14 patients received topical antifungal agents (unknown in one case): five
patients received amphotericin B and voriconazole; two patients received amphotericin
B, voriconazole, and natamycin; two patients received voriconazole and natamycin; two
patients received voriconazole only; and one patient each received voriconazole and
natamycin, amphotericin B only, and unspecified antifungal substances. Eight patients
had more invasive antifungal treatment involving instillation of amphotericin B or
voriconazole into the anterior chamber or the vitreous body. Information on outcomes
is available for 13 patients: nine patients received at least one keratoplasty, whereas
three patients resolved their infection without operation. Two of the patients with
keratoplasty and an additional patient without known keratoplasty underwent enucle-
ation. In contrast, 7 patients recovered some visual acuity. For four patients, information
on the recovery of eyesight was not available.
Fusarium species involved in eye infections and multilocus sequence typing of
FSSC. Species of the FSSC, especially F. petroliphilum and F. keratoplasticum, dominated
in eye infections (Table 1). Among the confirmed clinical cases, FSSC accounts for the
vast majority (13/15 [87%]). In contrast, species isolated from cases with unknown
clinical relevance and cases with contamination mostly belonged to the Fusarium
oxysporum complex (Table 1). Two strains of the FSSC were assigned to the still-
unnamed phylogenetic species 9 and 25. Fusarium proliferatum and F. lactis were
representatives of the FFSC causing keratitis. The sequence types of the FSSC species
are listed in Table 5. Three out of the nine sequence types detected in this study have
not been published before.

 (MIC50) of 22 studied Fusarium strains for eight antifungal agents are listed in Table 1.
The MICs of the quality control strains were in the expected ranges in all batches tested.
The susceptibilities to amphotericin B, natamycin, isavuconazole, itraconazole, po-
saconazole, and caspofungin did not differ between the species complexes. The lowest
MICs were reached by amphotericin B, with a total GM MIC of 1.41 mg/liter. With the
exception of the F. solani sensu stricto strain JMRC:NRZ:0205, the MICs for natamycin
ranged between 4 and 8 mg/liter. All isolates showed MICs of �8 mg/liter for caspo-
fungin, itraconazole, and posaconazole. The isavuconazole MIC was found to be 8
mg/liter for only one strain; the remaining strains had MICs greater than 8 mg/liter. For
voriconazole, more pronounced differences among the different species were found: in
the FSSC, 8/13 (62%) of isolates showed MICs of �8 mg/liter, while for FOSC, only 1/6
(17%) and none of the FFSC strains had MICs of �8 mg/liter, which was also underlined
by the higher voriconazole GM of the FSSC (9.9 mg/liter) than the GMs of the FOSC (5.0
mg/liter) and the FFSC (6.3 mg/liter). In our experimental setting, all strains of the FSSC
showed MICs for terbinafine of �32 mg/liter. In contrast, all members of the FOSC and
the FFSC tested showed MICs for terbinafine of �8 mg/liter (Table 1).

diagnosed at the NRZMyk show that eye infections by Fusarium species are a rare but
serious cause of ocular infection in Germany. A British study found a distinctly rising
number of Fusarium keratitis cases after 2007 (18). Unfortunately, despite a clear
increase in yearly cases since 2014, our data do not allow conclusions on a potential rise
in Germany, as the NRZMyk was only established in 2014 and has generally experienced
rising numbers of samples submitted for diagnostic work-up.
Fusarium species complexes, species, and sequence types involved in eye
infections. In our study, species of the FSSC are the dominating etiological agents of
eye infections, accounting for the vast majority of definite clinical cases. This is in line
with data found in other countries, e.g., Tunisia (66% [5]), India (75.7% [24]), and Mexico
(80.9% [25]), and in contact lens-associated outbreak cases in the United States (77%
[12]). Only one French study reported almost equal proportions of FSSC (47%) and
FOSC (41%) (15).
There are only a few studies (12, 26, 27) with a focus on Fusarium eye infections that
identified the strains to the species level or sequence type. In agreement with our
findings, F. petroliphilum and F. keratoplasticum (corresponding to the sequence type/
phylogenetic species 1 and 2 of Chang et al. [12] and O’
Donnell et al. [26]) were the
dominating species infecting the human eye in the aforementioned studies.
Oechsler et al. (28) reported that infections with FSSC required a significantly longer
treatment course and a higher necessity for a therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty, and
they were associated with a poorer outcome than infections by non-solani Fusarium
species. We found no definite clinical case caused by the FOSC in this study, while the
FOSC was involved in 18% of U.S. outbreak cases (12). In the three cases with uncertain
clinical relevance and evidence of FOSC, the fungus was isolated only from the contact
lens or contact lens disinfectant solution, whereas no fungus could be isolated from
corneal swabs. It is unclear whether the contact lens and/or fluid were contaminated or
if the isolation of FOSC from clinical specimens was not successful because the vitality
of the fungus was reduced by antifungal treatment. However, these results and the
three contaminations caused by FOSC suggest that the presence of this species
complex does not necessarily result in an infection, which could be due to a reduced
ability of spore attachment and penetration. Experimental evidence suggests that FOSC
has a lower pathogenic potential than FSSC (29–31).
Fusarium lactis being a cause of keratitis is a new finding in our report. This species
has been considered to be a specific pathogen of figs geographically restricted to
California (61). In a survey on dried figs in Apulia (Italy), only the fig-specific Fusarium
ramigenum was isolated, not F. lactis (33). However, a second isolate of F. lactis from

 corneal scrapings was received by the NRZMyk in 2016 (JMRC:NRZ:0506, our unpub-
lished data), supporting the occurrence of this species in clinical specimens in Germany.
The number of FSSC sequence types (STs) determined in this study is too low to
detect clear differences in diversity or virulence, but some similarities to the isolates
involved in the keratitis outbreak of 2005 and 2006 (13) become apparent. FSSC 1-a was
a dominating ST of F. petroliphilum in the outbreak and also frequent among our
isolates (50%). In agreement with O’
Donnell et al. (13), the diversity of STs was higher
in F. keratoplasticum (3 STs in 3 isolates) than in F. petroliphilum (2 STs in 6 isolates).
Similarly to the findings of O’
Donnell et al. (13), we found only FSSC 5-c of. F. solani to
infect the eye.
In vitro antifungal susceptibility of Fusarium species infecting the eye. To date,
no clinical breakpoints have been established for Fusarium species. Recently, CLSI
epidemiological cutoff values (ECVs) were determined for the FSSC and the FOSC and
four antifungals (amphotericin B, voriconazole, posaconazole, and itraconazole) (34).
The CLSI protocol applies a distinctly lower final inoculum of 0.4 to 5 � 104 CFU per ml
(33), while the EUCAST protocol uses a final inoculum between 1 and 2.5 � 105 CFU/ml
(35). These differences in the inoculum MICs of the FSSC strains tested in this study are
similar to those obtained by Espinel-Ingroff et al. (34). For the FOSC, only the MICs
determined for posaconazole (�8 mg/liter) exceeded the CLSI ECV of 8 mg/liter.
Our results confirm amphotericin B to be the antifungal agent with the lowest MICs
for Fusarium spp., which has been shown in several studies (23, 34, 36). The MICs
obtained for natamycin (which has a polyene structure similar to amphotericin B) are
comparatively high but in line with the MICs reported by other authors (4 to �8
mg/liter [37, 38]). Lalitha et al. (37) considered isolates with MICs of �16 mg/liter to be
susceptible to natamycin, because these levels are reached in the eye during standard
therapy. If the typical prescription dose is considered, natamycin was found to be more
effective than amphotericin B, which may be a result of differing drug penetration,
since natamycin, due to its smaller molecular size, more easily penetrates the eye (39).
The intrinsic resistance of Fusarium to echinocandins has been shown in other studies
(21, 22) and was confirmed by the high MICs recorded for caspofungin in this study.
The susceptibility findings of Fusarium strains against isavuconazole, itraconazole,
and voriconazole were in agreement with former findings (23, 32, 34, 38, 40, 41). Only
the high MICs for posaconazole (�8 mg/liter) obtained for all isolates included in the
present study differ from the published values that are, in general, slightly lower for the
FOSC and the FFSC (23, 34, 36, 38, 41).
In our setting, all isolates of the FSSC had MICs for terbinafine of �32 mg/liter, while
all members of the FOSC and the FFSC tested showed distinctly lower MICs (Table 1).
This was a clear-cut delimitation of the FSSC, allowing the assignment of a Fusarium
strain to the FSSC already by its susceptibility profile. To date, microdilution tests of
more than 60 clinical Fusarium strains have been performed by the NRZMyk, and not
a single strain belonging to a non-solani Fusarium species complex had a terbinafine
MIC of 16 mg/liter or higher (data not shown). Using the same inoculum, Alastruey-
Izquierdo et al. (23) found similar terbinafine MICs for Fusarium solani but also for single
isolates of other species complexes. The distinctly lower terbinafine MICs obtained for
the FSSC by Homa et al. (24) might be due to the lower CLSI inoculum used in that
study.
There is no doubt that identification to the species level is required for an under-
standing of the epidemiology of Fusarium infections. However, from the clinical point
of view, the distinction within a species complex is not necessary, since the suscepti-
bility profiles within FSSC or within FOSC are similar. The identification of a pathogenic
strain to the species complex is likely to be sufficient to make a treatment decision.
Risk factors. In contrast to studies from countries with a tropical climate, we
identified the use of soft contact lenses as the main and possibly most important risk
factor. Other than in previous reports, we were not able to identify any evidence of
major trauma (4, 5, 42) or surgery (2, 43) or underlying immunosuppression (6) in any

 of our patients. Wearing soft contact lenses is a well-known risk factor in temperate
climates (44), and cases with a severe course have been described (3, 45). The risk
appears to be related to the contact lens disinfectant solution used (10, 11), as it has
been repeatedly shown that some disinfectant solutions are not effective against
Fusarium spp. (46, 47), especially when heated (9). According to Ahearn et al. (48), the
increase in the incidence of mycotic keratitis since 2006 might also be connected with
marketing of a “no-rub”multipurpose contact lens solutions and the higher frequency
of silicone hydrogel lens use. In addition, overnight use and poor lens care, as well as
certain practices, such as refilling bottles of disinfectant solution, may contribute to an
increased risk of fungal keratitis. It should be noted that isolation of Fusarium spp. solely
from the contact lens or the used disinfection fluid does not confirm fungal keratitis.
These isolations are often not linked to clinical infection but represent contaminations.
Therefore, sampling from the infected cornea is strongly recommended for diagnostic
purposes. Of note, we found a striking predominance of female patients in our
population. This might be due to the fact that women are more likely to wear contact
lenses (49). In addition, the use of cosmetics may increase the risk of infection, since
they may be heavily contaminated (50).
Therapy and outcome. Our data show that invasive treatment of Fusarium keratitis
and endophthalmitis is frequently necessary. The outcome can be disastrous, with a
rate of 3/13 enucleations in confirmed clinical cases with known outcome. The well-
known and sometimes long delay from clinical manifestation to establishment of the
correct diagnosis is known to be a risk factor for a poor outcome. The use of steroids
during this period mitigates any local inflammatory response to the infection and thus
also contributes to a late diagnosis and poor outcomes, e.g., due to intraocular spread
and subsequent need of enucleation.
Natamycin (51) and voriconazole (52) may be effective, but our data are not
representative of a decision concerning the most effective treatment. In the literature,
good efficacy of natamycin in eye infections caused by Fusarium spp. has been reported
(7, 42, 53). Natamycin was rarely used in our patient population (n � 5), but it may have
been effective, since three of four patients treated with natamycin and who had a
known outcome preserved at least some eye sight. Of note, natamycin is commonly
used as a 5% solution, but this formulation is currently not commercially available in
Germany. Therefore, natamycin eye drops can only be obtained by import or com-
pounded specifically by a local pharmacist. With increasing frequency of Fusarium eye
infection, clinicians should be aware of this additional therapeutic option. In addition to
local treatment, more invasive management, including corneal transplantation (54) and
even enucleation (7% of enucleations were due to Fusarium in an eye hospital in
Thailand [8]), has been reported. Long duration of antifungal treatment seems to be
required due to common recurrence of infection (53, 54).
In conclusion, this first report of eye infections caused by Fusarium spp. in Germany
reveals the use of soft contact lenses to be the most important risk factor. Definite and
often very serious infection is commonly caused by FSSC, and the MIC of terbinafine
allows a simple and early differentiation of FSSC and non-solani Fusarium species.
Therapy remains difficult, with a frequently adverse outcome. Given the severity of the
disease, the diagnosis should be made as early as possible, and the therapeutic arsenal
should include natamycin, although this is not commercially available in Germany.
Since this type of ocular infection is relatively rare, establishing a collaborative ap-
proach of ophthalmic centers and microbiologists involved in the treatment of this
difficult disease is mandatory to obtain more extensive information about the clinical
course and to correlate this with microbiological findings. A registry-type approach
would be an appropriate way to collect anonymized data from the centers involved.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolates. All Fusarium isolates from patients with suspicion of fungal keratitis which were received
by the NRZMyk between January 2014 and December 2015 were included in the study. The isolates
were either grown from the infected eye (corneal swabs or scrapings or vitreous aspirates) or from
material related to the eye (contact lens, disinfectant solution, or contact lenses container). All

Tables 2 to 5.
Patients. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (no. 4455-06/15). Clinical informa-
tion provided by the microbiologist or treating clinician was documented in anonymized form. A
subgroup of six patients gave written informed consent for personal interviews to collect more detailed
data. Of these patients, information was documented in pseudonymized form. For patient characteristics,
basic descriptive statistics, such as percentage or median and interquartile range (IQR), are used. Because
of the low case number, no test for differences was applied.
Molecular species identification and multilocus sequence typing of the FSSC. Genomic DNA was
extracted from 2- to 5-day-old cultures grown on 4% malt extract agar (MEA; Difco), according to the
protocol described by Möller et al. (62), with diverse modifications. Briefly, fungal material was transferred
to a tube containing acid-washed glass beads and 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 50 mM sodium EDTA,
3% [wt/vol] sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS] [pH 8]). The samples were homogenized for 5 min at maximum
speed using a vortex adapter, followed by 1 h of incubation in a thermomixer at 68°
C. Thereafter, the
tubes were spun for 10 min at 16,000 relative centrifugal force (RCF), and the supernatant was transferred
to a new 2-ml tube. An equal volume of a mixture of phenol, chloroform, and isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1
[vol/vol/vol] [pH 7.5 to 8.0]) was added. The samples were mixed by turning and spun for 10 min at
16,000 RCF. The upper (aqueous) phase was transferred to a new tube, and the step was repeated. Then,
a 0.5 volume of 99.9% ethanol was added to precipitate the DNA. After incubation for at least 10 min,
the DNA was pelleted at 16,000 RCF for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted, and the DNA pellet was
washed twice with 200 ml of 70% ethanol, dried, resuspended in 50 �l of distilled water, and stored at
�20°
C.
For species identification, a fragment of the translation elongation factor-1� (TEF-1 alpha) gene was
amplified by PCR and sequenced using the primers EF-1 (5=-ATGGGTAAGGAGGACAAGAC-3=) and EF-2
(5=-GGAAGTACCAGTGATCATGTT-3=) (55). For the FSSC, sequence types were identified based on TEF, the
second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II gene (RPB2), and the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS).
The RPB2 was amplified and sequenced using the primers 5F2 (5=-GGGGWGAYCAGAAGAAGGC-3=) and
7cR (5=-CCCATRGCTTGYTTRCCCAT-3=) (56). For the ITS, the primers V9G (5=-TTACGTCCCTGCCCTTTGTA-3=)
(57) and LR3 (5=-CCGTGTTTCAAGACGGG-3=) (58) were used for amplification, and ITS1 (5=-TCCGTAGGT
GAACCTGCGG-3=) and ITS4 (5=-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3=) (59) were used for sequencing. The 50-�l
PCR mixture contained a 0.2 �M concentration of each primer, 10 �l of 5� MyTaq reaction buffer
(including 5 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates and 15 mM MgCl2; Bioline GmbH, Luckenwalde,
Germany), 1 U of MyTaq DNA polymerase (Bioline GmbH), and approximately 100 ng of DNA. PCRs were
conducted on a TProfessional Trio PCR thermocycler (Biometra GmbH, Göttingen, Germany). Amplifica-
tion of TEF and ITS had the following PCR profile: one initial cycle at 95°
C for 8 min, followed by 40 cycles
of 45 s at 95°
C, 45 s at 55°
C, and 90 s at 72°
C, and one final cycle of 10 min at 72°
C. For the RPB2 a
touchdown PCR profile was used, with 5 cycles of 45 s at 48°
C, followed by 5 cycles of 45 s at 50°
C and
30 cycles of 45 s at 52°
C.
Consensus sequences were constructed by means of the SeqMan program version 11.0.0 (DNAStar;
Lasergene) and aligned using the program Se-Al version 2.0a11 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/seal/).
Species were identified by using the BLAST tool of GenBank (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi
?PAGE_TYPE�BlastSearch). Sequence types within the FSSC were determined using the Fusarium MLST
database of the Westerdijk Institute (http://www.westerdijkinstitute.nl/Fusarium/Biolomicsid.aspx). In
cases where no 100% identical match was found using the Fusarium MLST database, a BLAST search was
run for each sequence to find a previously described sequence type. If a 100% match in the Fusarium
MLST database was based on only one or two loci, the sequence of the lacking locus of the 100%
matching strain was searched in GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) for comparison.
In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing. The in vitro antifungal susceptibilities of 22 isolates were
determined by broth microdilution technique according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) standard methodology (35). Pure powders of known potency of the
following antifungals were used: amphotericin B (AMB; European Pharmacopoeia, Strasbourg, France),
natamycin (NAT; ChemicalPoint, Deisenhofen, Germany), terbinafine (TBF; Novartis Pharma AG, Cork,
Ireland), voriconazole (VCZ; Pfizer, Inc., Peapack, NJ, USA), itraconazole (ITZ; Janssen-Cilag GmbH, Neuss,
Germany), posaconazole (PCZ; MSD, Rahway, NJ, USA), isavuconazole (ISA; Basilea Pharmaceutica Inter-
national Ltd., Basel, Switzerland), and caspofungin (CAS; MSD). Microplates containing each antifungal
drug in one row were prepared by batch and stored frozen at �80°
C for �6 months. Fusarium isolates
were grown on MEA for 2 to 5 days at 30°
C. Spore suspensions were counted with a hemocytometer. The
final inoculum was 2 � 105 spores/ml. MIC endpoints were determined visually using a mirror after 48 h
of incubation at 35°
C and defined as a 100% reduction in growth in comparison to the drug-free wells.
For caspofungin, minimum effective concentrations (MECs) were determined by reading the microplates
with the aid of an inverted microscope. Two reference strains, Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 204305 and
Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019, which were recommended by EUCAST (35, 60) for antifungal suscep-
tibility testing using amphotericin B, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin, were
included as quality control in each set of tests. In order to allow the calculation of geometric means, high
off-scale MICs/MECs were raised to the next higher concentration.
Accession number(s). The sequences generated in this study were deposited in GenBank (https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/) under accession numbers MF467449 to MF467496 (see Table 5).
