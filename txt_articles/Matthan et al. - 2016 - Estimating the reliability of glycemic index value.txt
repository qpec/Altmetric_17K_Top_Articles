ABSTRACT
Background: The utility of glycemic index (GI) values for chronic
disease risk management remains controversial. Although absolute
GI value determinations for individual foods have been shown to
vary significantly in individuals with diabetes, there is a dearth of
data on the reliability of GI value determinations and potential sour-
ces of variability among healthy adults.
Objective: We examined the intra- and inter-individual variability
in glycemic response to a single food challenge and methodologic
and biological factors that potentially mediate this response.
Design: The GI value for white bread was determined by using
standardized methodology in 63 volunteers free from chronic disease
and recruited to differ by sex, age (18–85 y), and body mass index
[BMI (in kg/m2): 20–35]. V
olunteers randomly underwent 3 sets of food
challenges involving glucose (reference) and white bread (test food),
both providing 50 g available carbohydrates. Serum glucose and insulin
were monitored for 5 h postingestion, and GI values were calculated by
using different area under the curve (AUC) methods. Biochemical vari-
ables were measured by using standard assays and body composition by
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.
Results: The mean 6 SD GI value for white bread was 62 6 15
when calculated by using the recommended method. Mean intra-
and interindividual CVs were 20% and 25%, respectively. Increasing
sample size, replication of reference and test foods, and length of
blood sampling, as well as AUC calculation method, did not improve
the CVs. Among the biological factors assessed, insulin index and
glycated hemoglobin values explained 15% and 16% of the vari-
ability in mean GI value for white bread, respectively.
Conclusions: These data indicate that there is substantial variability in
individual responses to GI value determinations, demonstrating that it is
unlikely to be a good approach to guiding food choices. Additionally,
even in healthy individuals, glycemic status significantly contributes to
the variability in GI value estimates. This trial was registered at clinical-
trials.gov as NCT01023646.

INTRODUCTION
Consumption of carbohydrate-containing foods elicits varied
postprandial blood glucose responses. To better define this effect,
Jenkins et al. (1) proposed the glycemic index (GI)6 method to
classify foods according to their postingestion plasma glucose
response. The GI is defined as the “incremental area under the
blood glucose response curve (AUC) of a 50-g available car-
bohydrate portion of both a test and reference food consumed by
the same individual over a 2-h period, expressed as a percent-
age” (1). Glycemic load (GL) is GI adjusted for serving size of
the food (2). This concept was originally developed as a food
selection guide for diabetic individuals to improve their glycemic
control by classifying foods into low (,55), medium (56-69) and
high (.70) GI categories (3). However, use of GI has gone be-
yond this original intent and is now being endorsed for use as
a labeling tool to guide food choices to reduce chronic disease
risk (4) and serves as the basis for many popular diets (e.g., South
Beach and Zone). Although there are some clinical data to sup-
port a modest benefit of low GI and GL diets in the management
of diabetes (5, 6), in the nondiabetic population the evidence is
mixed (7). Meta-analysis of prospective studies supports a posi-
tive association between high GI diets and increased chronic
disease risk (8), but data from randomized clinical trials indicate
an inconsistent relation between dietary GI and GL values and insulin
sensitivity (9), cardiovascular disease (8, 10), weight loss (11, 12),
and cancer (13, 14). Some of this discrepancy in the literature has
been attributed to methodologic issues with its measurement (15–18).

 The GI value is considered to represent the inherent property of
the food and not the metabolic response of an individual to the food
(11). Thus, theoretically GI values should be reproducible within
and among individuals. However, a review of the published GI
tables, which is a compilation of the GI values of individual foods
generated by several laboratories (3, 19), indicates different esti-
mates for the GI value within a category and even for the same food
(11, 20, 21). This could result in a food being ranked as low by one
laboratory and high by another (22). To reconcile these differences,
several methodologic factors have been evaluated (23) and in an
attempt to standardize GI value determination of foods an In-
ternational Standard (24) was established based on the Joint FAO/
WHO Expert Consultation (18, 25) and other recommendations
(21, 23). However, evidence is still limited on sources of variability
that affect the reliability of GI value estimates. The objective of the
present study was to determine the intra-individual and in-
terindividual variability in glycemic response to a single food
challenge and potential methodologic and biological factors that
could mediate responses among healthy adults.
METHODS
Study participants
Healthy men and women with wide age (18–85 y) and BMI
ranges [(in kg/m2) 20–35] were recruited from the Greater
Boston area (Supplemental Figure 1). Individuals who were mor-
bidly obese, were diagnosed with type 1 or 2 diabetes, had a fasting
glucose $125 mg/dL, or reported use of medications or supplements
known to affect glucose metabolism (insulin, sulfonylureas,
metformin, glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinedione, insulin sen-
sitizers), gastrointestinal motility (prokinetic agents), or lipid
metabolism (bile acid sequestrants, fibrates, cholesterol absorp-
tion and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase in-
hibitors, nicotinic acids, anabolic steroids, fish oil) were excluded.
Also excluded were individuals with renal, liver, pancreatic, or
cardiovascular disease; uncontrolled hypertension; inflammatory
bowel disease; disorders of esophageal and gastrointestinal mo-
tility; previous esophageal or gastric resection; autoimmune or
connective tissue disorders; hypo- or hyperthyroidism; and ane-
mia or poor venous access. Other exclusion criteria included
smoking, weight gain or loss $5 kg within the prior 6 mo,
consuming .7 alcoholic drinks/wk, pregnant or breastfeeding
women, and those unwilling to adhere to study protocol. Seventy
volunteers were enrolled in the study. Seven of these volunteers
did not complete the study for the following reasons: time con-
straints (n = 4), change in medical status (n = 2), and noncom-
pliance (n = 1). All volunteers were informed about the nature and
risks of the experimental procedures before their written, in-
formed consent was obtained. The study was approved by the
Tufts University/Tufts Medical Center Institutional Review Board.
Study design
Volunteers underwent 6 sessions in our Metabolic Research
Unit, and each session was 6–7 h in duration. The study pro-
tocol, including environment, procedures, and timing, was
standardized to minimize introduction of unaccounted-for
variability. Sessions took place 1–2 times/wk, with a maximum
of 12 wk to complete all sessions. Individuals underwent 3 sets
of food challenges in random order, and each set included
glucose or bread. The statistician (LMA) was responsible for
generation of the randomization sequence using the random-
number generator in Microsoft Excel, and numbers were as-
signed to the volunteers in sequential order by enrollment date
by the study coordinator. The principle investigator (AHL), co-
investigator (NRM), and all laboratory personnel were blinded
to the testing order. The reference, glucose drink [500 mL
(100 g/L)], and the test food, white bread (Pepperidge Farm
Original White Bread; 96.25 g white bread, 2.4 g dietary fiber),
both provided 50 g of available carbohydrates. On the days that
volunteers were challenged with white bread, they also con-
sumed 500 mL water to match the volume of the glucose so-
lution. Before testing, volunteers fasted overnight for 12 h and
refrained from consuming alcohol and exercising for 72 h.
Blood sampling and testing protocol
Fifteen to 30 min before each session, a retrograde intravenous
catheter was inserted into the lower cephalic or superficial dorsal
veins of the hand to allow sampling of arterialized venous blood.
This approach allowed an adequatevolume of blood to be collected
for the biochemical measures proposed and avoided the variability
introduced when venous blood is sampled (23, 26, 27). A con-
tinuous normal saline infusion was used to maintain the blood
sampling line during the course of the challenge. In addition,
15 min before each blood draw time point, volunteers were asked
to place their hand in a moderately heated box (448C–468C) to
avoid the inconsistencies associated with temperature control
when using heated pads. After collection of a baseline blood
sample, volunteers consumed the test or reference food within
a 10-min period. Additional blood samples were obtained at 15,
30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, and 300 min. Vol-
unteers remained in the Metabolic Research Unit and were re-
stricted to sedentary activities (watching television, reading, etc.)
to avoid displacement of the intravenous line. During one of the
sessions, habitual physical activity patterns were assessed by
using the Community Healthy Activities Program questionnaire
(28). Volunteers also underwent a body composition scan by
using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
Biochemical analysis
At each time point, serum was immediately separated by
centrifugation at 1100 3 g at 48C. Glucose was measured by
using a commercially available kit (Cobas MIRA; Roche Di-
agnostics). Insulin was measured by using a solid-phase, 2-site
chemiluminescent immunoassay (Diagnostic Products Corpo-
ration). Interassay CVs were 1.7 and 6.0 for glucose and in-
sulin, respectively. Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA),
an indicator of insulin resistance and b cell function, was
calculated according to the following formula: glucose
(mg/dL) 3 immunoreactive insulin (mU/mL)/22.5. Total cho-
lesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and tri-
glyceride concentrations were measured at baseline and 60,
120, 180, and 240 min on a Hitachi 911 automated analyzer
(Roche Diagnostics) by using enzymatic or immunoturbidi-
metric reagents. VLDL cholesterol was estimated as the dif-
ference between TC minus LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol.
The assays were standardized through the Lipid Standardization

Nonesterified free fatty acids (NEFAs) were monitored over the
entire 5-h period by using an in vitro enzymatic colorimetric
method (Wako Chemicals). C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured
by using the Tina-quant CRP high sensitive immunoturbidimetric
assay, whereas glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), a measure of longer-
term glucose control (6-wk half-life), and fructosamine, a measure
of shorter-term glucose control (12-d half-life), were measured by
using commercially available reagents (Roche Diagnostics). Body
composition was measured by using a Hologic QDR 4500 densi-
tometer (Hologic Inc.). Measures included total fat, lean muscle
mass (LM), and lean plus bone mineral content (LM+BMC), cal-
culated for whole body, trunk, and abdominal regions by using
DXA. Body-fat content was expressed as a percentage of total
weight. Standard anthropometric measurements (weight, height, and
circumferences of the waist, hip, and midthigh) were made on the
same day that body composition was determined by DXA, in
triplicate, by using standard techniques.
Calculation of glycemic variables
Consistent with the recommended protocol for nondiabetic in-
dividuals, the incremental glucose AUC (AUCi) was calculated
geometrically as the sum of the areas of the triangles and trape-
zoids over 2 h, excluding the area below the initial fasting glucose
concentration (18, 25). The GI for each individual was calculated
by dividing the serum glucose AUC for white bread by the mean
serum glucose AUC for the reference glucose drink, measured
3 times, and multiplied by 100. These values were then averaged to
obtain the mean GI value for each individual. Similarly, the insulin
index was calculated by dividing the serum insulin AUC for white
bread by the mean serum insulin AUC for the reference glucose
drink, multiplied by 100, and then averaged for each individual.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed on data from the 63
volunteers who completed the study by using SAS 9.3 (SAS

 Institute Inc.). Descriptive data are expressed as means 6 SDs.
PROC VARCOMP was used to derive the interindividual
(square root of subject variance divided by the mean GI value)
and intra-individual (square root of error term divided by the
mean GI value) CV. Comparison of baseline characteristics
between sexes was done by using unpaired t test. PROC MIXED
was used to determine differences in serum glucose, insulin,
NEFAs, TC, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol,
and triglyceride concentrations between glucose and white bread
over the course of the study. When the food challenges 3 time
interaction was significant at P , 0.05, multiple comparisons at
each time point were carried out by using Tukey’s post hoc test.
Given that current recommendations stipulate that the reference
food should be tested 2 or 3 times in each subject, and a minimum of
10 subjects should be studied, we determined the effect of sample
size and replication of the test and reference by calculating the mean
GI value for the first 2 of the 3 trials, or all 3 trials for sequential
numbers of volunteers in groups of 10, up to 63. We also calculated
the GI values at 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, and 300
min by using the AUCi method. In addition, 3 other approaches
were used to calculate the AUC for the glucose drink and white
bread, and corresponding GI values at 120, 150, 180, 240, and 300
min. The cut AUC (AUCcut) was calculated as the incremental area
until serum glucose concentrations first returned to the initial
fasting glucose concentration. The minimum AUC (AUCmin) was
calculated as the incremental area using the lowest serum glucose
concentration as baseline. The net AUC (AUCnet) was calculated
by subtracting the sum of the negative areas of the triangles and
trapezoids from the positive areas. In each case, the intra- and
interindividual CVs were calculated as described above. Corre-
lations between GI value of white bread and serum glucose AUC
following consumption of the reference glucose drink were de-
termined by Spearman correlation. PROC GLM was used to
measure the association between mean GI value for each in-
dividual and body composition variables adjusted by age and sex.
Finally, we fitted a random-intercept mixed-model by using
PROC MIXED with a normal distribution for the error term to
determine which biological factors contributed to the total vari-
ation in GI at 120 min, assuming equal correlation among the
3 GI values for each individual. The random intercept was used to
decompose the total variance in GI into the sum of the in-
terindividual and the intra-individual variance.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics
The mean 6 SD age and BMI for all volunteers were 49 6 16 y
and 27 6 4, respectively (Table 1). When analyzed by sex,
women were younger with lower waist circumference; waist-
to-hip ratio; blood pressure; and glucose, fructosamine, and
LDL cholesterol concentrations; and higher HDL cholesterol
and NEFA concentrations than men. Additionally, differences
in body composition, primarily higher percentage of whole
body and trunk total fat, and lower LM content and BMC were
observed in the women, who also reported being less physi-
cally active. No sex difference was observed for BMI or for
triglyceride and CRP concentrations.
Glycemic and lipid response
The serum glucose and insulin response to the glucose drink
(reference) and white bread (test) was measured over the course
of the 5-h study period (Figure 1). To be consistent with the
recommended protocol for calculating the GI value (24), we
initially used the 2-h data to calculate the AUCi. The glucose
AUCi was 5755 6 1054 and 3510 6 731 and insulin AUCi was
4624 6 924 and 3427 6 818 for the glucose reference and white
bread, respectively. The mean GI value for white bread was 62.4 6
15.3. However, there was marked variability in the GI values
among volunteers (Figure 2). The intra-individual CV was 20%,
and the interindividual CV was 25%, ranging from 2% to 77%.
Interestingly, volunteers with a low GI value for white bread had

 a similar SD to that of volunteers with a high GI value (48 6 14
compared with 82 6 17), which suggests that the relation be-
tween the mean GI value and SD is not linear.
An initial decline was observed in serum NEFA concentra-
tions, which was significantly different between the glucose drink
and white bread at 45, 60, and 90 min, but this rebounded starting
at 150 min and remained significantly higher from 180 through
300 min (Supplemental Figure 2). There was no significant
effect on postprandial TC, LDL cholesterol, and HDL choles-
terol concentrations between the glucose drink and white bread
(Supplemental Figure 3A). An increase in triglyceride con-
centrations after consumption of white bread relative to the
glucose drink was observed at 120 and 180 min (Supplemental
Figure 3B). The differences in NEFA and triglyceride concen-
trations were modest, and their clinical relevance is unclear.
Methodologic variables
Increasing sample size as well as number of repeat measures of
the reference and test food from 2 to 3 did not have a significant
effect on the mean GI value for white bread (Figure 3A, B), or on
the intra- and interindividual CVs. The GI value for white bread
increased whereas the interindividual variability decreased as
the length of sampling time increased from 120 to 300 min
(Figure 3C). The intra-individual variability also decreased with
increased sampling time, being lowest at 150 min and then in-
creasing slightly at 240 and 300 min.
The method of AUC calculation had a substantial effect on the
GI value as well as the variability (Figure 4). The AUCmin
method consistently resulted in the lowest mean GI value as well
as lowest intra- and interindividual CVs, whereas the AUCnet method
resulted in the highest mean GI value. The recommended AUCi
method and the AUCcut method resulted in similar mean GI
values at all time points. Of note, with the exception of the
AUCmin method, significant correlations were observed between
the GI value for white bread and the plasma glucose AUC after
consumption of the glucose reference at all time points when the
AUCnet method was used, and starting from the 150-min time
point when the AUCi method was used and at the 240-min time
point for the AUCcut method (Table 2).
Biological variables
By using univariate analysis there was no significant effect of
sex (63 6 15 for men compared with 62 6 16 for women; P =
0.81) or BMI [67 6 18, 62 6 14, and 58 6 15 for BMI categories
18.5–24.9 (normal), 25–29.9 (overweight) and 30–35 (obese),
respectively, P = 0.17] on the GI value for white bread. The GI
value for white bread was negatively associated with total and
trunk fat and positively associated with LM and LM+BMC.
However, after controlling for age and sex, these associations
were no longer significant (Supplemental Figure 4).
Using mixed models, we then examined the proportion of
interindividual variation in GI value for white bread (Figure 5)
that was contributed by biological variables. Sex; waist-to-hip
ratio; blood pressure; NEFAs; LDL cholesterol; HDL choles-
terol; baseline serum glucose, insulin, and fructosamine con-
centrations; HOMA; and physical activity contributed ,5% to
the variability. Age, BMI, and serum triglyceride and CRP
concentrations, and TC:HDL cholesterol ratio explained be-
tween 5% and 11% of the variability, whereas 15% and 16% of
the variability in GI value for white bread was explained by
insulin index and HbA1c values, respectively. The mean insulin
index was 78.8 6 26.3 with significant differences between men
and women (85 6 27 and 72 6 24, respectively; P = 0.04).
DISCUSSION
The usefulness of the GI concept for dietary guidance has been
questioned because of limitations with methodology. In this study,
despite using recommended GI methodology, we documented
substantial variability in the mean intra-individual (20%) and in-
terindividual (25%) CVs for a single food, white bread. Addressing
methodologic variables, such as sample size, test replication, and
length of sampling as well as AUC calculation method, did not
improve the CVs. Among the biological variables assessed, age,
BMI, TC:HDL cholesterol ratio, and serum triglyceride and CRP
concentrations accounted for 5–11% of the variability. A novel
finding of this work was that insulin index and HbA1c values
accounted for 15% and 16% of the interindividual variability in
GI value for white bread, respectively, indicating that even in
healthy individuals, glycemic status significantly contributes to

 the variability in GI estimates, which limits its clinical and
public health applicability.
The substantial variation in GI value observed in our study is
consistent with prior studies that have reported CVs. Intra-
individual CVs for white bread in healthy volunteers have ranged
from 17% (29) to 31% (27, 30), whereas the interindividual CVs
have ranged from 12% to 50%, averaging between 20% and 25%
(27, 31–33). This high variability suggests greater potential for
misclassification of foods. As demonstrated in our volunteers, the
white bread tested had a mean GI value of 62, classifying it in the
medium category. However, the range of individual GI values was
large, so it would be classified as having a low value for 22 in-
dividuals (GI: 35–55), intermediate for 23 individuals (GI: 57–67),
and high for 18 individuals (GI: 70–103).
Studies have identified methodologic factors that can affect GI
value determinations (22, 23, 27, 34), but efforts to address them

subjects. The table below each figure shows the mean intra- and interindividual CV%, derived by using PROC VARCOMP. The square root of the subject
variance divided by the mean glycemic index value yields the interindividual CV, whereas the square root of the error term divided by the mean glycemic

 have been met with varying degrees of success (16). To minimize
the intra-individual CV, it is recommended that the GI value of
the test food be derived from the ratio of the glycemic response it
elicits over the average of 2, preferably 3, glycemic responses to
the reference (24). Similar to previous studies, we found intra-
individual variability was not reduced with this testing strategy
(22, 33). Of note, we also controlled for factors, such as physical
activity and alcohol consumption, before testing days that have
been shown to contribute to the day-to-day fluctuations in GI
values (30). However, our volunteers were not required to
consume a standardized evening meal before testing, which has
been recommended in the updated International Standards Or-
ganization methodology. Although this has been proposed as
a potential source of variability (35), other studies (36, 37) have
not documented differences in glucose AUC after either a stan-
dardized or nonstandardized meal.
Among methodologic variables that can potentially influence
the interindividual variability in GI values, we addressed sample
size, length of blood sampling, and AUC calculation method. The
standardized methodology recommends testing a minimum of 10
subjects, although it is suggested that a larger sample size would
improve precision (22, 23). Increasing the sample size to 63
individuals did not reduce the interindividual CV. With regard
to the length of blood sampling period, at early time points
(30–90 min) the variability was high, presumably reflecting differ-
ences in absorption rates among volunteers. Extending the time
to 300 min proportionally increased the GI value but decreased
both the intra- and interindividual CVs. Method of AUC cal-
culation also affected the mean GI value and CVs (34). Based on
the hypothesis that the glucose tolerance status of an individual
would not affect the GI value of the food being tested, we cal-
culated the correlation between the GI value and glucose AUC
after consumption of the reference. Only the AUCmin method
met these criteria at all time points tested. The AUCi and AUCcut
methods were valid only at 120 min. The AUCnet method did not
meet the criteria at any of the time points tested.
The GI value is derived by testing the reference and test food in
the same volunteer, which theoretically should control for the
variability among people that can be caused by biological factors.
Consequently, guidelines do not include sex- or age-specific
criteria, although it is recommended to study healthy individuals,
with the International Standards Organization standards ex-
cluding individuals with diseases or taking drugs that affect
digestion and glucose metabolism, as we did. In our study, sex;

geometrically as the sum of the areas of the triangles and trapezoids over 2 h, excluding the area below the initial fasting glucose concentration; AUCcut, cut AUC
measured until the serum glucose concentrations first returned to the initial fasting glucose concentration; AUCmin, minimum AUC calculated by using the

from the positive areas. The table below the figure shows the intra- and interindividual CV%, derived by using PROC VARCOMP. The square root of the
subject variance divided by the mean glycemic index value yields the interindividual CV, whereas the square root of the error term divided by the mean
glycemic index value yields the intra-individual CV.

 body composition variables; lipid profile; blood pressure; NEFA;
baseline glucose, insulin, and fructosamine, concentrations;
HOMA; and physical activity were not significant contributors to
the variability in GI values. Age and inflammatory status, as
reflected by CRP concentrations, explained w
10% of the var-
iability in GI value for white bread. This age effect has been
observed in one study (38), but was not seen in another (39),
probably because of the smaller differential in mean age in the
latter compared with the former study (20 compared with 46 y),
as well as our study (67 y).
Our results document that the insulinemic response as reflected
by the insulin index, and longer-term glycemic control as reflected
by HbA1c values, were important contributors to the variability in
GI. It has been suggested that the insulin index might be a better

 variable than the GI value because postprandial insulin responses
are not always proportional to blood glucose concentrations or to
the carbohydrate load of some foods (40). However, we observed
similarly high intra-individual (16%) and interindividual (30%)
CVs for the insulin index. Based on prior studies (41, 42) in normal
compared with diabetic individuals and those with impaired
glucose tolerance, it has been concluded that glycemic status does
not significantly affect the mean GI value, although it has been
acknowledged that the variability differs among groups. This has
led to the recommendation that GI values be determined in
normoglycemic individuals. Our study indicates that glycemic
status is a significant contributor to the variability in GI re-
sponse, even in normoglycemic individuals. Additionally, given
the positive relation between postprandial glycemic response
with HbA1c and CRP concentrations (43, 44), the inflammatory
status of the individual might also be an important mediating
factor.
Blood glucose response is affected by several additional factors:
differing physical structure of apparently similar foods, food
processing or preparation method (45), and meal consumption
patterns (single or mixed meals) (11, 22, 46), which can contribute
to the marked inter- and intra-individual variation observed in
the GI value of foods. These factors, together with those de-
scribed in this paper, document that there are far too many
exceptions that influence the accuracy and precision of GI
values calculations for them to be used as a basis for making
food-based recommendations. Additionally, GI values do not
reflect the nutritional quality of the food, further questioning
their clinical relevance.
In summary, our data indicate substantial variability in GI
value determinations for white bread despite the use of stan-
dardized methodology and multiple testing in a large number
of healthy volunteers. The high degree of variability dem-
onstrates that there is potential to misclassify foods into the 3
commonly used GI categories (low, medium, and high), which
would result in the inability to distinguish between foods,
thus invalidating the practical applicability of the GI value.
Additionally, our results indicate that the variability was
explained in part by differences in baseline HbA1c and in-
sulin index, suggesting that longer-term glycemic control and
insulin response, even in normoglycemic individuals, affect
the GI value. The impact of these findings on GI estimates
and subsequent associations with chronic disease risk needs
to be considered.
