Abstract
Background and objectives In the general population, there is increasing recognition of the effect of thyroid
function on patient-centered outcomes, including health-related quality of life and depression. Although
hypothyroidism is highly prevalent in hemodialysis patients, it is unknown whether thyroid status is a risk factor
for impaired health-related quality of life or mental health in this population.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements We examined the association of thyroid status, defined by serum
thyrotropin, with health-related quality of life and depressive symptoms over time in a prospective cohort of
450patientsonhemodialysisfrom17outpatientdialysisfacilitiesfromMayof2013toMayof2015whounderwent
protocolized thyrotropin testing, Short-Form 36 surveys, and Beck Depression Inventory-II questionnaires
every 6 months. We examined the association of baseline and time-dependent thyrotropin categorized as tertiles
and continuous variables with eight Short-Form 36 domains and Beck Depression Inventory-II scores using
expanded case mix plus laboratory adjusted linear mixed effects models.
Results In categorical analyses, the highest baseline thyrotropin tertile was associated with a five-point lower
Short-Form 36 domain score for energy/fatigue (P=0.04); the highest time-dependent tertile was associated with a
five-point lower physical function score (P=0.03; reference: lowest tertile). In continuous analyses, higher baseline
serumthyrotropin levels (+D1 mIU/L) were associatedwithlower rolelimitationsdue to physicalhealth (b=21.3;
P=0.04), energy/fatigue (b=20.8; P=0.03), and pain scores (b=21.4; P=0.002), equivalent to five-, three-, and five-
point lower scores, respectively, for every 1-SD higher thyrotropin. Higher time-dependent thyrotropin levels
were associated with lower role limitations due to physical health scores (b=21.0; P=0.03), equivalent to a three-
point decline for every 1-SD higher thyrotropin. Baseline and time-dependent thyrotropin were not associated
with Beck Depression Inventory-II scores.
Conclusions In patients on hemodialysis, higher serum thyrotropin levels are associated with impaired health-
related quality oflifeacrossenergy/fatigue, physicalfunction,andpaindomains.Studiesare needed to determine
if thyroid-modulating therapy improves the health-related quality of life of hemodialysis patients with thyroid
dysfunction.

Introduction
Epidemiologic data show that patients with advanced
CKD, including those receiving dialysis, have a sub-
stantially higher prevalence of thyroid disease, in-
cluding hypothyroidism, compared with their non-CKD
counterparts (1–7). Furthermore, large cross-sectional
studies have shown an increasingly higher burden of
hypothyroidism with incrementally impaired kidney
function (1,4). Although increasing evidence shows that
hypothyroidism, defined by an elevated serum thyro-
tropin (TSH) level, is associated with higher mortality in
patients on dialysis (3,5), the underlying mechanisms for
heightened death risk (e.g., cardiovascular, metabolic,
and hematologic pathways) remain undefined (8).
In the general population, hypothyroidism has
pervasive effects on multiple end organs, among
which the neuropsychiatric system is a major target
of thyroid hormone action (9,10). Animal models have
shown that thyroid hormones influence noradrenergic
and serotonergic neurotransmission in the pathogen-
esis of depression (11–17). In humans, functional brain
imaging studies have shown that thyroid hormone
affects brain metabolism in patients with hypothyroid
and mood disorders (18). Although population-based
studies of thyroid dysfunction and depression have
yielded mixed findings, thyroid hormone supplemen-
tation has been used in clinical practice to augment or
accelerate response to antidepressants among patients
with depressive disorders (10,12,19). In addition to
mental health impairments, untreated hypothyroidism
has been associated with overall reductions in health-
related quality of life (HRQOL) (20).
These observations bear particular relevance to
patients on dialysis who disproportionately suffer

 from impaired HRQOL and depression compared with the
general population (21–25). Left untreated, these disorders
may lead to higher risk of cardiovascular disease, hospital-
ization, and mortality (26–29). Recognizing its importance,
the US Center for Medicare Services Conditions for Cov-
erage mandates that dialysis facilities perform routine
measurements of HRQOL (30,31). Hence, there is compel-
ling need to identify novel and modifiable risk factors for
reduced quality of life (QOL) and depression in patients on
dialysis.
Although multiple factors concomitantly contribute to
the morbidity and mortality of patients on dialysis, there
are remaining knowledge gaps in how endocrine disorders
influence their health and survival. Despite the high
prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients on dialysis, no
studies have examined the association of thyroid status
with patient-centered outcomes, such as HRQOL and mental
health, in this population. Thus, we sought to determine
whether thyroid status, defined by serum TSH levels
measured at baseline and longitudinally, is associated with
reduced HRQOL and depression over time in a prospective
hemodialysis cohort.
Materials and Methods
Source Cohort
The study cohort consisted of adult incident and prev-
alent hemodialysis patients from the Malnutrition, Diet
and Racial Disparities in CKD (MADRAD) Study (Clinical-
Trials.gov NCT01415570), an ongoing prospective cohort
study examining the differential association between dietary
factors and nutritional status among racial/ethnic hemodi-
alysis subgroups (30). Every 6 months (semesters), partic-
ipants underwent protocolized collection of information on
sociodemographics, comorbidities, medications, and dialysis
treatment characteristics; administration of questionnaires;
serum collection; and laboratory testing during routine
outpatient hemodialysis treatments.
In this MADRAD Substudy, patients were recruited from
17 outpatient dialysis facilities in southern California from
May of 2013 to May of 2015. Patients were included if they
underwent at least one or more serum TSH measurement(s),
were age 18 years old or older at the time of study entry
(defined as the time of the first TSH measurement),
received thrice-weekly in-center hemodialysis for at least
4 consecutive weeks, and signed an institutional review
board–approved consent form. For analyses of QOL,
patients were required to have underwent a TSH mea-
surement and Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire admin-
istration during the same semester, the first instance of
which was designated as the baseline semester (SF-36
cohort). For analyses of mental health, patients were
required to have undergone a TSH measurement and
Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) questionnaire ad-
ministration during the same semester (BDI-II cohort).
Patients were excluded if they were actively receiving
peritoneal dialysis, had a life expectancy ,6 months, or
were unable to provide consent without a proxy. The
study was approved by the institutional review commit-
tees from Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at
Harbor–University of California, Los Angeles and the
University of California Irvine Medical Center.
Exposure Ascertainment
The exposure of interest was thyroid status defined by
TSH. First, we examined the association of baseline TSH
with outcomes, in which serum TSH levels were assessed at
study entry. Second, because the effect of time-dependent
exposure on outcomes may differ from the effect of base-
line TSH at study entry, we also examined the association
of time-dependent TSH with outcomes, in which time-
updated TSH levels were used to account for changes in
thyroid function over time. Each semester, all study
patients underwent protocolized TSH testing of fresh
serum samples obtained predialysis during weekday out-
patient hemodialysis treatments that were largely nonfast-
ing, which chronologically coincided with routine blood
tests conducted at the dialysis facilities. All TSH measure-
ments were conducted at a centralized laboratory in the
University of California Irvine Medical Center Clinical
Pathology Laboratory (second generation chemilumines-
cent immunoassay; Beckman Coulter, Chaska, MN; refer-
ence range 0.5–5.0 mIU/L).
Given that the normal TSH range in patients on dialysis
remains undefined, in coprimary analyses, we examined
TSH (1) categorized into tertiles of observed baseline values
(defined as ,1.28, $1.28–2.11, and .2.11 mIU/L) and (2)
as a continuous variable. Other routine dialysis laboratory
measurements were performed by the large dialysis orga-
nization’s central laboratory based in Deland, Florida on a
monthly or quarterly basis using automated methods.
Outcome Ascertainment
We examined the association of baseline and time-
dependent thyroid function with two coprimary outcomes,
namely (1) HRQOL ascertained using SF-36 surveys and (2)
depression ascertained using BDI-II. The SF-36 is a patient-
reported QOL assessment instrument validated in the
general and hemodialysis populations (20,28) consisting
of 36 questions grouped into eight domains/subscales
(minimum to maximum score of 0–100 for each domain,
with higher scores indicating a better state of health):
physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health,
pain, general health, energy/fatigue, social functioning, role
limitations due to emotional problems, and emotional
wellbeing. Because the objective of our study was to
examine the effect of thyroid function on specific QOL
domains, we examined the association of TSH with each
individual subscale defined as continuous outcomes.
We analogously examined the association of thyroid
function with the BDI-II score as a continuous outcome.
The BDI-II is a psychometric test used to measure depression
severity consisting of 21 multiple choice questions (minimum
to maximum score range of 0–63) that has been validated in
patients on hemodialysis (22,24,32). The total score for BDI-II
surveys in which ,50% of questions were unanswered was
rescaled as follows: rescaled BDI-II score = (actual BDI-II
score 3 total number of questions)/number of answered
questions. The BDI-II surveys in which .50% of questions
were unanswered were excluded from analysis.
Statistical Analyses
Baseline patient characteristics were presented for the
SF-36 cohort (n=450). The baseline characteristics for the
BDI-II cohort (n=444) were essentially the same and thus,

 were not provided. Multivariate linear mixed effects
analyses were performed to examine the association of
baseline and time-dependent TSH as categorical and
continuous variables with SF-36 and BDI-II scores. The
association between TSH and each outcome was examined
using three nested linear mixed effects models: (1) un-
adjusted model: TSH level and time (month from baseline);
(2) case mix model: unadjusted model covariates plus
baseline case mix covariates consisting of age, sex, race,
ethnicity, diabetes, and vintage; and (3) expanded case mix
plus laboratory model: case mix model covariates plus
expanded case mix covariates (body mass index, marital
status, and insurance) and baseline laboratory measure-
ments (serum albumin, normalized protein catabolic rate
[nPCR], serum creatinine, and single-pool Kt/V).
In this study, we present results from the expanded case
mix plus laboratory models in more detail, because results
from unadjusted and case mix models were similar. In
analyses of TSH as a continuous variable, to account for
possible nonlinear associations (particularly at lower TSH
ranges [,0.5 mIU/L]) with outcomes, we conducted
sensitivity analyses that only considered patients in the
euthyroid (TSH=0.5–5.0 mIU/L) and hypothyroid
(TSH.5.0 mIU/L) ranges (i.e., excluded 22 patients with
TSH,0.5 mIU/L). We also examined for effect modifica-
tion by sequentially adding interaction terms of each
covariate and TSH level to the expanded case mix plus
laboratory model. Modifier effects of all covariates were
examined using baseline and time-dependent TSH as the
main exposure variables.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the
robustness of the main results after (1) excluding patients
with exogenous thyroid hormone supplementation (thy-
roxine [T4], tri-iodothyronine [T3], and combination T4/T3
therapy; n=28) and (2) incremental adjustment for antide-
pressants (Supplemental Table 1) in addition to expanded
case mix plus laboratory covariates. There were no instances
of receipt of thyroid hormone suppressive therapy.
Baseline missing data were imputed using multiple
imputation methods with ten imputed datasets. Missing
baseline covariates included body mass index, serum
albumin, nPCR, serum creatinine, and single-pool Kt/V (13%,
18%, 14%, 19%, and 16% of data). Analyses were implemented
in SAS 9.4 PROC MIXED, MI, and MIANALYZE (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC). Two-sided tests with P,0.05 were
considered statistically significant after false discovery rate
(FDR) adjustment was used to account for multiple com-
parisons (33).
Results
Study Cohort Characteristics
The final study cohort consisted of 450 patients who
underwent at least one TSH measurement and the SF-36
survey during the same semester (SF-36 cohort), whereas
444 patients underwent both TSH and BDI-II testing during
the same semester (BDI-II cohort) (Supplemental Figure 1).
Approximately 35%, 45%, and 20% of patients in the SF-36
and BDI-II cohorts underwent one, two, and three repeated
measurements, respectively, over time; one patient un-
derwent four repeated measurements. Baseline character-
istics of the SF-36 cohort showed that, compared with
patients in the lowest TSH tertile, those in the highest tertile
were less likely to be black, were more likely to be Hispanic,
and had longer dialysis vintage (Table 1). The study
cohort’s mean6SD and minimum to maximum TSH values
on the basis of baseline measurements were 2.2062.90 and
0.07–39.4 mIU/L, respectively.
Thyroid Status Categorized as TSH Tertiles, QOL, and
Depression
In the overall cohort, 35% of patients (n=156) had baseline
data only. Among the remaining patients (n=294) who had at
least two visits, the median (interquartile range) follow-up
time was 12.4 (6.0–18.5) months. In baseline analyses, the
highest TSH tertile was associated with a five-point lower
SF-36 domain score for energy/fatigue versus the lowest
tertile (P=0.04) (Table 2). In time-dependent analyses, the
highest TSH tertile was associated with a five-point lower
score for physical function (P=0.03) and showed a trend
toward a lower energy/fatigue score versus the lowest tertile
(b=23.0; P=0.10). We did not observe a significant associ-
ation between TSH tertiles and BDI-II score after FDR
adjustment, although the overall association trends were
similar to the main analyses.
Thyroid Status as a Continuous Variable, QOL, and
Depression
Thyroid status examined as a continuous variable was
also associated with several important QOL domains.
Figure 1 and Table 3 summarize the estimates from the
model fit, which are to be interpreted as the average change
in SF-36 domain score associated with a 1-mIU/L change in
TSH level. Higher baseline TSH level (+D1 mIU/L) was
associated with a lower pain score (estimate [b]=21.4;
P=0.002). Thus, a 1-SD increase in TSH level on the basis of
all repeated measure values (approximately +D3.4 mIU/L)
was associated with a five-point decline in pain score,
considered to be a clinically relevant difference in the SF-36
domain score (34). Higher baseline TSH was also associated
with lower scores for role limitations due to physical health
(b=21.3; P=0.04) and energy/fatigue (b=20.8; P=0.03). In
addition, there was a trend toward an association between
higher baseline TSH level (+D1 mIU/L) and lower scores
for role limitations due to emotional problems (b=21.3;
P=0.06) and social functioning (b=20.8; P=0.08). Similar
findings were observed in analyses restricted to patients
with euthyroid and hypothyroid-range TSH values on
study entry (Supplemental Table 2).
Similar to the baseline analyses, time-dependent TSH
levels over time were negatively associated with scores
for role limitations due to physical health. For example, a
1-mIU/L increase in TSH level over time was associated
with a one-point decline in the SF-36 domain score for role
limitations due to physical health (b=21.0; P=0.03).
Equivalently, a 1-SD increase in TSH on the basis of all
repeated measure values (approximately +D3.4 mIU/L)
was associated with a three-point decline in the SF-36
domain score for role limitations due to physical health.
There was also a trend toward an association between
higher TSH levels over time (+D1 mIU/L) and lower scores
for physical function (b=20.5; P=0.06) and pain (b=20.5;
P=0.09). In analyses restricted to patients with euthyroid
and hypothyroid TSH ranges on study entry, similar findings
1276
Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology
 were observed, although associations between time-
dependent TSH and role limitations due to physical health
were no longer statistically significant (P=0.58) (Supple-
mental Table 2).
We did not observe a significant association between
baseline or time-dependent TSH and the BDI-II score in
expanded case mix plus laboratory models (Supplemental
Table 3). Similar findings were observed in analyses re-
stricted to patients with euthyroid and hypothyroid TSH
ranges on study entry (Supplemental Table 2).
Adjustment covariates found to be important in the
relationship between the main exposure, thyroid status,
and the coprimary outcomes, SF-36 and BDI-II scores, are
presented in Supplemental Tables 3 and 4, respectively (all
covariates with P values ,0.10 in the expanded case mix
and laboratory model). We did not find that QOL or
depression outcomes changed significantly over time after
study entry (within 24 months of follow-up), except for the
SF-36 domain energy/fatigue score, in which there was a
statistically significant but modest effect size (b=+0.2;
P=0.003).
Effect Modification of the Association between Thyroid
Status and Outcomes
Age was found to be a potential effect modifier of the
association of TSH level with the BDI-II score, emo-
tional wellbeing, and general health (P-interaction=0.05,
P-interaction ,0.01, and P-interaction=0.07, respec-
tively) (Table 4). However, after FDR adjustment for
multiple comparisons, interactions were no longer
significant.
Thyroid Hormone Supplementation and Antidepressant Use
In analyses that excluded patients receiving thyroid
hormone replacement therapy (n=28), higher baseline
TSH level was significantly associated with lower scores
for energy/fatigue and pain (Supplemental Table 5).
Higher time-dependent TSH level was significantly

physical health observed in the overall cohort as well as
physical function, energy/fatigue, and pain.
In analyses that incrementally adjusted for antidepres-
sant use, higher baseline TSH level was significantly asso-
ciated with lower scores for role limitations due to physical
health, energy/fatigue, and pain and trended toward an
association for role limitations due to emotional problems
and social functioning (Supplemental Table 5). Higher time-
dependent TSH level was significantly associated with lower
scores for role limitations due to physical health and trended
toward an association with lower scores for physical function
and pain.
Discussion
Among a prospective cohort of patients on hemodialysis
who underwent protocolized thyroid testing every 6
months, higher TSH levels were associated with impair-
ments across multiple HRQOL domains. Higher baseline
and time-dependent TSH tertiles were associated with
lower (worse) HRQOL domain scores for energy/fatigue
and physical function, respectively. When examined as a
continuous variable, higher baseline TSH levels were
associated with worse scores for role limitations due to
physical health, energy/fatigue, and pain and trended
toward an association with worse scores for social func-
tioning and role limitations due to emotional problems. In
analyses of time-dependent TSH as a continuous variable,
we similarly observed that higher TSH levels were signif-
icantly associated with impairments in role limitations due
to physical health and trended toward an association with
worse physical function and pain.
In the general population, there has been increasing
recognition of the effect of thyroid function on patient-
centered outcomes, such as physical and mental health
(12,19,35). Some but not all studies have documented an
association between thyroid status and self-reported
HRQOL ascertained by the SF-36 questionnaire (19,36,37).
In a cross-sectional study of 2057 Brazilian patients with
hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine for at least 6
months by Vigário et al. (37), those who were undertreated
reported lower levels of HRQOL across physical function,
role-physical, vitality, and role-emotional domains com-
pared with adequately treated patients. In contrast,
there were no differences in any of the HRQOL domain
scores among overtreated versus adequately treated
patients. In a double-blinded, randomized, crossover study
of 33 patients with hypothyroidism receiving usual-dose
(designated as the euthyroid arm) versus higher-dose
levothyroxine (designated as the subclinical thyrotoxicosis
arm), those with subclinical thyrotoxicosis had slightly
worse physical component summary and general health
subscale scores compared with those in the euthyroid arm

 (19). However, in a study of 9000 participants in The
Netherlands who underwent TSH and SF-36 testing,
HRQOL scores were indistinguishable between those
with normal and elevated TSH levels (36).
To our knowledge, our study is the first study to
examine the association between thyroid status and
HRQOL in patients on dialysis. Similar to the study by
Vigário et al. (37), we observed that higher TSH levels
were associated with worse levels of physical function,
specifically energy/fatigue, physical function, and role
limitations due to physical health, across several pri-
mary and secondary analyses. These findings may have
important implications on the health and survival of patients
on dialysis for several reasons. First, routine assessment of the
HRQOL of patients on dialysis as well as interventions that
improve their functional status and overall wellbeing have
become a major emphasis of the United States ESRD program
and clinical practice (30,31). To date, few interventions have

 been identified that result in significant improvements in
HRQOL (30,38,39), and thyroid functional disease may be a
potentially modifiable factor for reduced QOL in this
population. Second, this is the first study in patients on
dialysis to document an association between higher TSH
levels and low levels of physical function, a strong predictor
of death in this population (40–42). Although multiple
coexisting mechanisms may lead to impaired physical
function in patients on dialysis (e.g., older age, comorbid-
ities, and inflammation) (43), it is plausible that myalgia,
reduced muscle strength, higher oxygen requirements
during physical activity, and refractory anemia ensuing
from hypothyroidism may be potent yet under-recognized
contributors (8,44–48). Indeed, it is established that thyroid
hormones have direct action in nearly every tissue, in-
cluding the skeletal muscle, bone and cartilage, and the
heart, and emerging data suggest TSH may have extra-
thyroidal effects on these end organs given the presence of
TSH receptors in skeletal muscle, bone, and brain (49–51).
Because levothyroxine replacement has been shown to
improve certain aspects of physical function in the general
population (e.g., strength and cardiopulmonary exercise
performance) (46,52), future studies are needed to deter-
mine whether correction of thyroid status with exogenous
thyroid hormone improves physical function in patients on
dialysis. A third novel finding of our study was the
observed association between higher TSH levels and
worse levels of pain. Although chronic pain is a common
complaint among patients on dialysis, there has been little
research regarding its causative factors and consequences
(30,53,54). Further studies are needed to characterize the
association between thyroid function and pain in patients
on dialysis.
Whereas our study observed a trend toward an associ-
ation of thyroid status with worse levels of role limitations
due to emotional health, we did not find a significant
association between TSH and depressive symptoms ascer-
tained by the BDI-II scores. Although a relationship be-
tween hypothyroidism and depression in the general
population has been presumed for many years, the true
nature of this association has been difficult to define due to
conflicting studies, which may relate to heterogeneous
study populations, definitions of thyroid functional status,
and methods of depression ascertainment (e.g., diagnostic
codes, validated questionnaires, or self-report) (12). The
absence of an observed association between thyroid func-
tion and depressive symptoms in our cohort may be due to
the large proportion of patients with milder depressive
symptoms suggested by the low prevalence of antidepres-
sant use (14% of patients); measurement of self-reported
depressive symptoms using the BDI-II questionnaires in lieu
of objective measures of clinical depression, which are
defined using standard Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Health Disorders IV criteria (24,55); true absence of a
biologic association; or type 2 error. Further studies are
needed to elucidate the association of thyroid status with
mental health using alternative measures of depression in
patients on dialysis.
The strengths of our study include its well characterized
cohort of patients on hemodialysis who underwent proto-
colized TSH testing and the SF-36 and the BDI-II surveys at
6-month intervals; examination of repeated measures of
thyroid function, HRQOL, and depressive symptoms; and
comprehensive availability of patient-level data on socio-
demographics, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory
data collected in the outpatient setting. However, several
limitations of our study bear mention. First, we defined
thyroid status using serum TSH only as the most sensitive
and specific single metric of thyroid function in the general
population given its inverse logarithmic association with
serum T3 and T4 levels (56) and its robust characteristics in
the setting of nonthyroidal illness and uremia. In contrast,
routinely used free T4 assays are hormone protein binding
dependent and may result in spurious results in conditions
where serum protein levels are low (e.g., malnutrition) or
circulating substances impair hormone protein binding
(e.g., uremia) (57). Furthermore, although T3 has gained
recognition as an important metric of thyroid status in
cardiovascular outcome studies, given that cardiac myocytes
are unable to locally generate T3 from its T4 precursor, the
vast majority of circulating T3 is derived from the periph-
eral conversion of T4 to T3, which is highly sensitive to
inflammation, malnutrition, and cortisol levels. Conse-
quently, low T3 may be observed in mild illness indepen-
dent of thyroid functional status, whereas TSH is typically
normal in mild to moderate illness and is not suppressed
until developing severe critical illness. Second, although
we cannot exclude residual confounding by protein energy
wasting, we adjusted for proxies of inflammation and
nutritional status (e.g., serum albumin, creatinine, and
nPCR). Third, our study used generic surveys of HRQOL
and depressive symptoms in lieu of disease-specific
instruments (e.g., Kidney Disease Quality of Life survey)
(20). Although disease-specific instruments show greater
sensitivity, we opted to administer generic measures to
allow for comparison across various populations. Fourth,
given the moderate sample size of our cohort, we accounted
for specific medications that were most potently associated
with thyroid status, HRQOL, and depressive symptoms
to avoid overadjustment. Fifth, as with all observational
studies, our findings do not confirm causal associations.
Although a global relationship between thyroid status
and HRQOL was robust, the individual associations were
tempered, and interventional studies examining the effect
of thyroid hormone replacement on these patient-centered
outcomes are needed.
In conclusion, our study found that higher TSH levels
were independently associated with impaired HRQOL,
particularly across the domains of physical health, energy/
fatigue, and pain, in a prospective hemodialysis cohort.
Given the high prevalence of thyroid functional disease
and strikingly low levels of QOL, further studies are
needed to determine the underlying mechanisms by which
thyroid functional disease impairs functional status and
wellbeing in patients on dialysis and whether thyroid
hormone replacement improves HRQOL in this population.
