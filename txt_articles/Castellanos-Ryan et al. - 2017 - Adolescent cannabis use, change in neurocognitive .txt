Abstract
The main objective of this prospective longitudinal study was to investigate bidirectional 
associations between adolescent cannabis use (CU) and neurocognitive performance in a 
community sample of 294 young men from ages 13 to 20 years. The results showed that in early 
adolescence, and prior to initiation to CU, poor short-term and working memory, but high verbal 
IQ, were associated with earlier age of onset of CU. In turn, age of CU onset and CU frequency 
across adolescence were associated with (a) specific neurocognitive decline in verbal IQ and 
executive function tasks tapping trial and error learning and reward processing by early adulthood 
and (b) lower rates of high-school graduation. The association between CU onset and change in 
neurocognitive function, however, was found to be accounted for by CU frequency. Whereas the 
link between CU frequency across adolescence and change in verbal IQ was explained (mediated) 
by high school graduation, the link between CU frequency and tasks tapping trial and error 
learning were independent from high school graduation, concurrent cannabis and other substance 
use, adolescent alcohol use, and externalizing behaviors. Findings support prevention efforts 
aimed at delaying onset and reducing frequency of CU.
Cannabis is the most widely used substance worldwide (Degenhardt & Hall, 2012; 
Degenhardt, Stockings, Patton, Hall, & Lynskey, 2016; Hall et al., 2016) and is perceived, 
among adolescents, as less harmful than other substances (Johnston, O’Malley, Bachman, & 
Schulenberg, 2013). The debate surrounding the beneficial and harmful effects following 
recreational or medical use still continues, especially as adolescence is viewed as a period of 
vulnerability for brain development, and cannabis as a threat to this development. There is

 evidence to suggest that the adolescent brain may be particularly vulnerable to the 
neurotoxic effects of substances, especially with regard to neurocognitive functioning 
(Rubino et al., 2009; Schweinsburg, Brown, & Tapert, 2008). This is because adolescence 
represents a critical period of neurodevelopment, characterized by synaptic pruning and 
increased myelination, particularly in cortical and frontal areas of the brain. Moreover, the 
endocannabinoid system appears to be involved in the regulation of the key 
neurodevelopmental processes of synaptic pruning and myelination (Lubman, Cheetham, & 
Yucel, 2015; Paus, 2005, 2007), suggesting that the introduction of exogenous cannabinoids 
during adolescence could disrupt normal brain development and, in turn (Lubman et al., 
2015; Rubino & Parolaro, 2016), have an impact on cognitive function (Broyd, van Hell, 
Beale, Yucel, & Solowij, 2016; Volkow et al., 2016). Some support for this has come from 
animal and human studies showing that cannabis exposure during adolescence was 
associated with morphological and connectivity changes in brain structures that are densely 
populated with cannabinoid receptors (e.g., in the prefrontal cortex [PFC], hippocampus, 
and cerebellum; Burns et al., 2007; Realini, Rubino, & Parolaro, 2009; Rubino et al., 2015).
Although the mediating role of these structural/morphological changes resulting from 
cannabis use (CU) and cognitive function has yet to be demonstrated, several studies show 
that heavy, long-term CU is associated concurrently with impaired neurocognitive function 
(NCF) in animals and human adults (e.g., Fried, Watkinson, & Gray, 2005; Lubman et al., 
2015; Rubino & Parolaro, 2016; Verrico, Gu, Peterson, Sampson, & Lewis, 2014). Similarly, 
studies comparing adolescents using cannabis on a regular basis (i.e., weekly) to controls 
reported that they have reduced processing speed (Gruber, Sagar, Dahlgren, Racine, & 
Lukas, 2012; Lisdahl & Price, 2012; Medina et al., 2007) and perform worse on tasks 
assessing attention (Hanson et al., 2010; Lisdahl & Price, 2012; Mathias et al., 2011; Medina 
et al., 2007), verbal memory (Hanson et al., 2010; Medina et al., 2007), intelligence (Harvey, 
Sellman, Porter, & Frampton, 2007), and executive function (Grant, Chamberlain, Schreiber, 
& Odlaug, 2012; Harvey et al., 2007; Lisdahl & Price, 2012; Mathias et al., 2011; Medina et 
al., 2007). Some suggest that these effects may persist even after extended periods of 
abstinence (Bolla, Brown, Eldreth, Tate, & Cadet, 2002; Broyd et al., 2016; Crean, Crane, & 
Mason, 2011; Lyons et al., 2004), but this is still debated as meta-analyses showed that all 
non-acute, residual effects of CU on cognitive performance in adults and adolescents were 
no longer detectable after 1 month or more of abstinence (Schreiner & Dunn, 2012; Schulte 
et al., 2014). Nonetheless, most human studies contributing to this debate are cross-sectional 
case-control or retrospective, without proper assessment of cognitive function prior to CU 
onset. This is an important limitation, as presubstance use performance on certain IQ and 
executive function tasks (assessed, e.g., at 12–14 years) have been shown to be linked with 
later substance use onset and increased CU frequency (Castellanos-Ryan, Séguin, Vitaro, 
Parent, & Tremblay, 2013; Squeglia, Jacobus, Nguyen-Louie, & Tapert, 2014; White & 
Batty, 2012) or be associated with change in CU frequency and severity (Cousijn et al., 
2014). In the absence of clinical trials, prospective longitudinal studies that include pre- and 
postdrug use neurocognitive assessments are needed to clarify temporal associations 
between CU and neurocognitive development and guide prevention efforts.
Only a few studies have examined the prospective specific association between adolescent 
CU and NCF. One longitudinal study following adolescents with substance use disorders,

 including CU disorder, over time, found that greater cumulative CU over an 8-year follow-
up period was associated with poorer attention functioning (Tapert, Granholm, Leedy, & 
Brown, 2002). However, although specific effects of CU were examined, authors caution 
that their findings cannot be attributed solely to any one substance, as polysubstance use was 
the norm rather than the exception in that sample. In another study, by Fried et al. (2005), 
concurrent chronic, but not former, heavy cannabis users showed lower scores on IQ (d ≈ 
0.29) and memory (d ≈ 0.30) and faster processing speed (d ≈ 0.44) at ages 17–20 years 
relative to nonusers, adjusting for pre-CU onset neurocognitive performance (9–12 years). 
However, chronic CU was based on retrospective reports, and it is unclear if early onset of 
use was specifically related to neurocognitive decline beyond the effects of concurrent use. 
In contrast, a recent prospective longitudinal study by Meier et al. (2012) showed that 
persistent CU over a 20-year period across young adulthood (18–38 years) was associated 
with a global decline in IQ and neurocognitive performance from ages 13 to 38 years (d = 
0.38). In that study, the association between persistent CU and neurocognitive decline 
remained when controlling for education, personality, other persistent substance use (SU) 
and socioeconomic status (SES; Moffitt, Meier, Caspi, & Poulton, 2013), but only for those 
whose persistent CU disorder was already present at 18 years. Further, secondary analyses 
on a small subsample showed that significant decline in NCF was still detectable in early 
users who reported infrequent (N = 17) CU in the year prior to testing in adulthood. Thus, in 
contrast to the findings of two meta-analyses (Schreiner & Dunn, 2012; Schulte et al., 2014), 
Meier et al.’s findings suggest that the decline in NCF was independent of frequent 
concurrent use (i.e., it did not recover with abstinence), and the authors question if onset of 
frequent use before age 19 may have detrimental and potentially irreversible effects on brain 
development in the long term. In sum, further studies are still needed not only because of the 
contrasting results between studies of adolescence and adulthood but also because the 
particular findings reported by Meier et al. (2012) were based on a small subsample of 
participants.
Furthermore, independent of potential neurotoxic effects of CU on the developing brain, the 
onset of CU is thought to alter a youth’s developmental trajectory in several ways. 
Adolescents who use cannabis regularly not only tend to have higher rates of early-onset 
behavioral problems (Flory, Lynam, Milich, Leukefeld, & Clayton, 2004; Heron et al., 2013; 
Windle & Wiesner, 2004), social adversity (von Sydow, Lieb, Pfister, Hofler, & Wittchen, 
2002), and other adolescent SU (Hibell et al., 2012), but also report poor educational 
performance and higher school dropout (Fergusson, Boden, & Horwood, 2015; Fergusson, 
Horwood, & Beautrais, 2003; Flory et al., 2004; Lynskey, Coffey, Degenhardt, Carlin, & 
Patton, 2003; Lynskey & Hall, 2000; McCaffrey, Pacula, Han, & Ellickson, 2010; Silins et 
al., 2014; Stiby et al., 2015; Windle & Wiesner, 2004), all of which may confound the 
relationships between CU and declines in cognitive function. Measures of school 
achievement and high school graduation, in particular, should be taken into account as 
adolescent CU is hypothesized to be associated with poor school attainment through its 
association with cognitive impairment. However, the opposite could also be true; CU may be 
associated with declines in cognitive function, at least in part, through poor school 
attainment (e.g., Silins et al., 2014), which in turn may have an impact on cognitive 
development (Brinch & Galloway, 2012).

 Within this context we aim to investigate the bidirectional associations between CU and 
cognitive function and their association with other important covariates: (a) whether pre-CU 
cognitive function is linked to CU onset and later frequency of use; (b) whether cognitive 
decline associated with adolescent onset of frequent use may be detected by young 
adulthood; and (c) whether it is actual adolescent-onset CU, independent of other factors 
(e.g., SES, high school graduation, adolescent alcohol use, externalizing problems, 
concurrent SU, and pre-CU cognitive function; Cousijn et al., 2014), that is associated with 
neurocognitive impairments. If declines in NCF are a direct result of adolescent CU, 
potentially through its neurotoxic effects on the developing brain, then one would 
hypothesize that (a) CU would precede a drop in cognitive functioning; (b) an earlier age of 
onset and more frequent CU would be associated with a larger cognitive decline; and (c) the 
association would persist after adjusting for important covariates, such as other concurrent 
SU, pre-CU cognitive function, externalizing problems, and academic achievement. 
Furthermore, one might expect that the PFCs would be especially likely to be involved, as 
the PFCs have a high density of cannabinoid receptors and continue to develop during 
adolescence. Therefore, one could hypothesize that (d) CU during adolescence would be 
associated with larger declines in cognitive function related to prefrontal cortices of the brain 
(e.g., performance on self-ordered pointing and conditional association tasks associated with 
mid- and posterior–dorsolateral frontal lobes, respectively) more than in function related to 
other brain areas (e.g., performance on paired associates learning and digit span tests 
associated with the hippocampus and medial temporal lobes). Alternatively, if associations 
between CU and cognitive decline do not persist after controlling for covariates, and there is 
evidence that academic achievement and/or other factors account for these associations, then 
results would provide support for other, more social, mechanisms by which CU and declines 
in cognitive function are associated. These are all important unresolved questions for 
planning prevention. We have addressed these questions in a prospective longitudinal design 
that assessed CU frequency yearly across adolescence (14–17 years) and NCF twice, in early 
adolescence and early adulthood.
Materials and Methods
Sample
The 294 young men who participated in this study were a sub-sample of the Montreal 
Longitudinal and Experimental Study of Low SES boys (MLES). In the spring of 1984, 
1,037 boys attending the last year of kindergarten (M age = 6.1 years) were recruited from 
schools in low-SES neighborhoods of Montreal. For further information on recruitment and 
selection criteria of the MLES sample, see Vitaro, Brendgen, Pagani, Tremblay, and McDuff 
(1999) and Tremblay, Pihl, Vitaro, and Dobkin (1994). Sex (boys), ethnicity (Caucasian), 
and SES (low to middle SES) were homogeneous as a result of the selection procedure. 
Boys were then assessed annually from 10 to 17 years and again at 20 years. This study was 
approved by the University of Montreal Institutional Review Board, with participation in the 
study requiring both parental consent and child assent. The 294 young men included in this 
study were selected for neurocognitive testing when they were on average 20 years of age 
(range = 18.47–22.02), based on trajectories of teacher-rated physical aggression and 
hyperactivity scores across childhood and adolescence; an attempt was made to recruit equal

 numbers of high and low scorers. Four hundred and ninety-four participants were identified 
and contacted over a period of 18 months until a target number of 300 participants were 
recruited. Three hundred and four young men (151 low aggressive and hyperactive, 87 high 
aggressive and hyperactive, and 66 high aggressive or high hyperactive) originally provided 
consent for neurocognitive testing. However, one participant violated drug/alcohol 
abstinence restrictions for testing and could not be rescheduled (for further information 
about selection and recruitment of this subsample, see Séguin, Nagin, Assaad, & Tremblay, 
2004). Another 4 participants were excluded from the current analyses because of 
insufficient CU data; all participants included in this study provided reliable cannabis and 
other SU data at a minimum of three time points across adolescence (out of five: 13–17 
years), and completed at least two of the neurocognitive tasks of interest at 20 years: digit 
span backward (n = 300), self-ordered pointing task (SOP, n = 300), conditional association 
task (CAT, n = 298), and a card playing task (CAPT, n = 232). A further 5 participants were 
excluded because they reported using cannabis before the first measurement of NCF, that is, 
13 years, which served to control for NCF prior to CU. This subsample did not differ 
significantly from the larger sample for whom SU data was available on alcohol use 
frequency, t (886) =0.12, p = .91; CU frequency, t (886) =0.42, p =.68; or number of 
substances tried, t (886) = 0.12, p = .91, across adolescence (averaged across 13 to 17 years). 
Séguin et al. (2004) previously showed that this subsample was also comparable to the larger 
sample on measures of hyperactivity, conduct disorder, and delinquency across adolescence. 
Within this sub-sample, missing data across adolescence was only predicted by verbal IQ at 
13 years (odds ratio [OR] =0.82, p < .05), with lower IQ scores being associated with higher 
likelihood of missing data, but not by other early adolescence cognitive variables, family 
risk, academic achievement, or externalizing problems. Finally, 43% of the boys in this 
sample used cannabis at some point during adolescence. Mean use among adolescent 
cannabis users was 3.19 (SD = 1.50, range = 1–7), equivalent to using cannabis 3 to 5 times 
in the past year, and 51% used cannabis at 20 years of age (mean use among adult cannabis 
users = 3.54, SD = 0.50, range = 1–4), equivalent to using cannabis “very often.” See Table 
1 for further sample characteristics and descriptive variables.
Instruments and procedure
Adolescent and adult cannabis and other SU frequency—Cannabis, tobacco use, 
and alcohol use frequency over the last 12 months were assessed annually from ages 13 to 
17 years using the Personal Experience Screening Questionnaire (PESQ; Winters, 1992); 
each rated on a 7-point scale: from never (0) to 40 or more times (6; see Table 2 for CU 
frequency by age; skewness ranged between 1.00 and 2.23; kurtosis ranged between –0.68 
and 3.84). The PESQ is one of the most widely used adolescent SU screening tools 
worldwide, and has been shown to have good content, construct and criterion validity in 
normative, juvenile offending and drug-abusing populations (Winters, 1992, 2003). An age 
of onset variable was computed identifying the age participants were when they first used 
cannabis; participants who had not reported having used cannabis as of the final adolescent 
assessment (age 17) were coded as initiating CU in the following year (i.e., 18 years). This 
procedure is preferable to dropping these participants from the analysis, and is commonly 
used in prospective longitudinal studies of SU (e.g., Hawkins et al., 1997). Alcohol use and 
tobacco use were averaged across 13 to 17 years and used as covariates in the final model

 (Model 4). Cannabis and other SU at 20 years were also assessed with the PESQ (Winters, 
1992), and tobacco use frequency over the last 12 months was assessed on a 4-point scale: 
never, sometimes, once a week, and many times per week.
Because age of onset and frequency measures of CU at each time point were strongly 
correlated in this sample (r > –.65), a residual score of age of onset (adjusting for its 
covariance with average CU frequency from 14 to 17 years) was created and entered into 
models in which CU frequency and age of onset were entered together as predictors.
NCF—NCF was indexed through a series of validated measures assessing abilities related to 
executive function, such as short-term and working memory, planning, trial and error 
learning, and IQ. To evaluate differential effects CU may have on distinct brain areas, the 
neurocognitive battery included a number of test tapping cognitive functioning related to 
different regions of the brain: working memory, planning, and trial and error learning are 
functions associated with frontal brain areas (Petrides, 1990; Petrides, Alivisatos, Evans, & 
Meyer, 2013); short-term memory is associated with functioning in the hippocampus and 
medial temporal lobes; and IQ is associated with broader functioning in a wider brain 
network, which includes the frontal and parietal lobes (Colom, Karama, Jung, & Haier, 
2010).
The paired associates learning (PAL) and digit span (DS) subtests (forward and backward) 
of the Wechsler Memory Scales—Revised (Wechsler, 1987) tap short-term memory 
functions often associated with the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe. During the PAL, 
participants are asked to listen to easy or difficult word pairs, and then asked, after the first 
word of a pair is provided, to cue recall for the second word. The DS task requires repeating 
digits in increasing spans, first in the right order (forward), followed by a backward order.
Number randomization (NR) and the SOP (Petrides et al., 1993), tap working memory 
functions associated with the middorsolateral frontal lobe. In the NR task, a range of 
numbers is provided, and participants must select all numbers without repeating a digit, 
using a pattern, or sequence more than two consecutive numbers. During the SOP, 
participants are shown 12 arrays of the same 12 stimuli arranged differently in each array, 
and asked to select a new stimulus in each array. Repetitions are counted as errors. CATs 
(Petrides, 1990) tap working memory, strategic planning functions, and an ability to learn 
associations between two arbitrary visual stimuli by trial and error: functions related to the 
posterior–dorsolateral frontal lobe. The CAT requires inductive reasoning, or learning by 
trial and error, to discover predetermined patterns of association between a color and an 
abstract symbol or a button and a light. The SOP (abstract and concrete forms) and CAT 
tests were administered in computerized form at age 20 years (Séguin et al., 2004), which 
differ from the noncomputerized versions administered at age 14 years (Séguin, Pihl, 
Harden, Tremblay, & Boulerice, 1995). The main difference lies in that scoring accuracy is 
increased and experimental error is reduced in the computerized forms, but versions do not 
differ in the construct and outcomes measured, as exemplified by their strong correlations 
across versions (and time): SOP r = .55, and CAT r = .52 (correlations among all 
neurocognitive tasks across time can be found in online-only supplementary Table S.1).

 A trial and error learning CAPT, adapted by Newman, Patterson, and Kosson (1987), 
assessing response perseveration (i.e., the inability to modulate default responding in light of 
motivationally significant cues) and reward/punishment processing, functions related to the 
dorsolateral and orbital–frontal cortices (OFC), was also completed. That task has been 
extensively validated in the study of externalizing behavior problems and in this sample 
(Séguin, Arseneault, Boulerice, Harden, & Tremblay, 2002; Séguin, Arseneault, & 
Tremblay, 2007). The CAPT is a computer-controlled behavioral laboratory task in which 
participants are asked to turn over cards, one at a time, from a deck of cards. Each time they 
turn over a card they will either win or lose money (5 cents). The task is designed to create a 
response set with the help of an initially high rate of rewards, but as the game progresses, 
responding is gradually followed by monetary loss. Participants were instructed to play until 
they decided to stop and were not given any goals or suggestions that could have biased their 
playing strategy.
Finally, a verbal IQ estimate at age 20 was obtained with the French equivalent of the 
vocabulary subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the Épreuve Individuelle 
d’Habile Mentale (Chevrier, 1989), and the age 13 years verbal IQ estimate was obtained 
from a sentence completion task (Veroff, McClelland, & Marquis, 1971).
The variables that code for errors (SOP, CAT, and CAPT) were sign reversed in regression 
and path analyses so that higher scores on any measure indicates better ability. Task 
instructions for the vocabulary, DS, PAL, NR, and CAT have been published elsewhere 
(Barker et al., 2011; Séguin et al., 2004), as have instructions for the card-playing task 
(Séguin et al., 2002) and for verbal IQ (Séguin, Boulerice, Harden, Tremblay, & Pihl, 1999).
Demographic variables and potential confounders—A measure of family risk at 
age 6 was included as a covariate index of SES in all analyses, because it has been 
associated with both SU (Hayatbakhsh, Najman, Jamrozik, Mamun, & Alati, 2006) and NCF 
(Lovallo et al., 2013). This index tapped parental age at birth of first child, occupational 
status, education, and family status (intact or nonintact; Tremblay et al., 1991). Academic 
achievement from ages 13 to 15 was assessed with teacher-reported global academic 
performance, and in adulthood, with a dichotomous measure of whether participants had 
been awarded a high school diploma, which was confirmed by the Ministry of Education of 
Quebec (see Boisjoli, Vitaro, Lacourse, Barker, & Tremblay, 2007, for further details). 
Teacher-rated externalizing problems (i.e., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and 
conduct disorder symptoms, including physical aggression) were assessed with the Social 
Behavior Questionnaire (Tremblay et al., 1991), with which teachers were asked to rate 
participant symptoms on a 3-point scale (never–often) at yearly intervals from ages 13 to 15. 
An average score across 13–15 years was computed for each set of symptoms. Table S.2 in 
the online-only supplementary materials shows correlations between cognitive measures and 
these covariates, indicating that performance on all cognitive measures in early adolescence 
and at 20 years, except for the CAPT, was associated negatively with family risk and 
externalizing problems and positively with academic achievement measures. Poor 
performance on the CAPT at 13 years was associated with higher family risk and lower 
academic achievement at 13 to 15 years, but not with externalizing problems or high school

 graduation; performance on the CAPT at 20 years was not significantly associated with any 
non-SU covariates.
Statistical analyses
An unconditional latent growth curve model of CU frequency was conducted to estimate the 
initial level (intercept) and the systematic change (slope) in CU frequency between the ages 
of 14 and 17 years. In the latent growth curve model framework, when a model is centered at 
the first time point (i.e., 14 years), the initial levels of CU frequency are modeled with the 
intercept (which varies across participants), and the systematic change over time; for 
instance a linear increase in CU frequency from 14 to 17 years, is modeled by a slope (which 
also varies across participants).
Next, a conditional latent growth model was conducted in which CU age of onset and CU 
frequency intercept and slope factors were associated with early adolescent NCF (at 13–14 
years) indexed through the measures described earlier. Finally, several path models were 
conducted to examine whether variability in cannabis age of onset, CU frequency at 14 years 
(intercept factor), and increases in CU frequency from 14 to 17 years (slope factor) were 
associated with change in NCF in early adulthood (20 years) from early adolescence (13–14 
years; using change scores; analyses using neurocognitive residualized scores and baseline 
scores as covariates were also conducted, yielding equivalent results). CU age of onset and 
CU frequency were entered into models separately (Models 1 and 2) and simultaneously 
(Models 3 and 4) to examine general and unique links of these aspects of CU on change in 
cognitive function. All models were adjusted for the effect of potential confounders: 
childhood adversity, academic achievement from 13 to 15 years verbal IQ at 13 years (and 
any cognitive function in early adolescence that was shown to be associated with later CU), 
age at adult testing, and concurrent cannabis, tobacco, and other SU in adulthood (20 years; 
Models 1–4). The last model further adjusted for high school graduation, adolescent alcohol 
use, and tobacco use frequency and externalizing problems (Model 4).
Analyses were conducted using Mplus version 6.11 (Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2009) using 
maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors (MLR). There is ongoing debate 
about how ordinal variables of more than five ordered categories, with skewness and kurtosis 
≤2 and ≤7, respectively, should be handled. Thus, several latent growth curve models of CU 
frequency were conducted using MLR and weighted least squares estimators. As results 
were similar across methods, mirroring previous simulation studies (e.g., Rhemtulla, 
Brosseau-Liard, & Savalei, 2012), only models using MLR are reported. Full information 
maximum likelihood was used to account for missing data. Tests of goodness of fit included 
the comparative fit index (Bentler, 1990), the root mean square error of approximation 
(Browne & Cudeck, 1993), and the standardized root mean residual. Finally, the Benjamini–
Hochberg procedure (Thissen, Steinberg, & Kuang, 2002) was used to correct for multiple 
testing in all analyses. Measures, data preparation, and analyses are further described in the 
Method section of supplementary online material.

 Results
Preliminary analysis: Unconditional latent growth model of CU frequency
Several growth curve models were conducted to assess which growth function fit the CU 
frequency data best (see the Preliminary analysis section in the supplementary material). A 
growth model where growth was assumed to be linear across the first three time points (14–
16 years), but left to be freely estimated for the last time point (17 years; see Figure 1), fit 
the CU data best (χ2 =10.6, df = 4, comparative fit index = 0.97, root mean square error of 
approximation = 0.07, standardized root mean square residual = 0.06) and showed that 
growth between time points 3 (16 years) and 4 (17 years) was smaller than at other time 
points (with the freely estimated loading resulting in 2.40 instead of a loading of 3.00, which 
is to be expected if growth was linear). Growth curve factor means (intercept = 0.29, slope = 
0.48) were significantly different from zero at p <.001 and showed that there was an overall 
tendency for CU frequency to increase from 14 to 17 years. There was also significant 
individual variability in the mean initial level of CU at 14 years (intercept = 0.61, p < .01) 
and its pattern of change over time (slope =0.39, p < .01). Initial CU at age 14 years did not 
correlate significantly with change of CU frequency across adolescence (r = .32, p = .15).
Is cognitive function in early adolescence (13–14 years) associated with CU onset 
intercept and later CU frequency slope?
To examine the links between NCF and CU onset and later CU frequency, we included 
cognitive variables in early adolescence (13 or 14 years), together with family risk, as 
predictors of later CU frequency (intercept and slope factors) and CU onset. The results in 
Table 3 show that poor performance on the PAL and SOP tasks, tapping into short-term and 
working memory, were associated with earlier onset of CU. In contrast, higher verbal IQ was 
associated with both earlier onset and a steeper increase in CU frequency.
Are age of onset and frequency of adolescent CU associated with NCF decline in early 
adulthood?
Significant associations between covariates and cognitive function in early adolescence and 
at 20 years were found (see Table S.2 in the supplementary material). Of note, high family 
risk, externalizing problems, and poor academic achievement were associated with poor 
performance on most, if not all, cognitive tasks. In addition, as shown in Table 4 (Model 1), 
cognitive performance on verbal IQ, PAL, and SOP tasks in early adolescence, as well as SU 
at 20 years were significantly associated with change in performance on many of the 
cognitive tasks. The results presented in Table 4 also show that although early age of CU 
onset was generally associated with a decline in cognitive function on the vocabulary, SOP, 
and CAT (Model 1), this was no longer the case when intercept and slope factors of CU were 
taken into account (Model 3, which used the residualized score of age of onset). In contrast, 
initial levels of CU frequency at 14 years (intercept factor) remained significantly associated 
with a decline in performance on the CAPT task (β = –0.27, p < .001), and a steeper 
increase in CU frequency across adolescence (slope factor) remained associated with a 
decline in performance on the vocabulary (β = –0.17, p < .01) and conditional association (β 
= –0.28, p < .001) tasks after controlling for multiple testing (Model 3). Once we adjusted 
for adolescent alcohol and tobacco use frequency, high school graduation, and other

 externalizing behaviors in Model 4, the significant associations between initial levels of CU 
frequency at 14 years and the CAPT (β = –0.30, p < .001) and between growth in CU 
frequency and the CAT remained (β = –0.21, p < .001; see Figure 2 for a graphical 
representation of these results). However, the association between growth in CU frequency 
and change in vocabulary was no longer significant; only high school graduation was 
significantly associated with change in vocabulary (β = 0.20, p < .001).
Because high school graduation was significantly and negatively associated with growth in 
CU frequency (slope factor): B = –0.12, SE = 0.057, OR = 0.54, 95% CI [0.30, 0.97], and 
age of onset, B = 0.06, SE = 0.025, OR = 1.34, 95% CI [1.02, 1.73], but not CU frequency at 
14 years (intercept factor): B = –0.07, SE = 0.039, OR = 0.83, 95% CI [0.51, 1.34], the 
significance of indirect effects from CU frequency slope to change in vocabulary through 
high school graduation was tested using the Rmediation program (Tofighi & MacKinnon, 
2011). The indirect effect from growth in CU frequency from 14–17 to change in verbal IQ 
through high school graduation was significant (slope): ab = –0.163, 95% CI [–0.334, –
0.032].
Is adolescent CU frequency associated with declines in functioning on the CAPT and the 
CAT in early adulthood in those that had abstained from CU over 12 months prior to adult 
cognitive testing?
In order to investigate whether the effects of initial levels of CU frequency and change 
across adolescence (intercept and slope factors) on declines in cognitive function could be 
considered long-term residual effects (as opposed to acute effects), analyses were repeated 
on the sample of participants that reported no CU over the last 12 months at age 20 (N = 
143). Forty adolescents of this subsample had used cannabis across adolescence, but none 
with onset before 15 years. Consequently, in the absence of adolescents who used cannabis 
at 14 years among this sample of abstainers, we were unable to confirm whether the effect of 
CU frequency at 14 years on the CAPT remained once adolescents abstained from CU in 
adulthood. However, in those who had abstained from using cannabis 12 months prior to 
cannabis testing at 20 years, the increase in CU across adolescence (slope) was still 
significantly associated with a decline in conditional association from preadolescence to 
early adulthood (B = –0.20, p = .017), suggesting that this association was not only due to 
concurrent or continued active CU into adulthood.
Discussion
This study was conducted to examine bidirectional effects between CU and cognitive 
function and to determine the extent to which age of onset or frequency of CU across 
adolescence were linked to neurocognitive decline between early adolescence pre-CU onset 
and early adulthood, after adjusting for key confounds. First, findings suggest that the 
relationship between neurocognition and CU may be bidirectional. In early adolescence poor 
short-term and working memory, but high verbal IQ, were associated with an earlier age of 
onset of CU. In turn, an earlier age of onset and more frequent use at 14 years and across 
adolescence were associated with neurocognitive decline by early adulthood. More 
specifically, adolescent CU frequency and earlier age of onset were associated not only with

 lower rates of high school graduation, controlling for early adolescent academic 
achievement, but also with neurocognitive decline in early adulthood, independently from 
high school graduation, concurrent cannabis and other SU, adolescent alcohol, and tobacco 
use, and externalizing behaviors. Second, links were not observed globally across all 
neurocognitive tasks, but only for verbal IQ and tasks tapping trial and error learning, an 
executive function process indexed by the conditional association learning task, and 
response perseveration on the CAPT (which also assesses reward processing). Third, 
although the results indicate that earlier age of onset was associated with a decline in a few 
NCFs, these effects were not independent of frequency of use. Despite an attempt to control 
for the high correlation between age of onset and frequency of CU by creating a residual age 
of onset score, it may not be possible to examine the true role age of onset plays in cognitive 
decline given this high correlation with frequency of use. However, the results suggest that 
CU during adolescence was associated with declines in specific cognitive functions through 
two different pathways or mechanisms: one more “social” mechanism related to school 
engagement, and another more “biological” mechanism related to potential neurotoxic 
effects on the adolescent brain.
More specifically, adolescent CU frequency was associated with declines in verbal IQ, but 
these effects were accounted for by high school graduation. Accordingly, our findings are 
consistent with studies showing that childhood and adolescent-onset mental health and CU 
(and other SU) problems are linked with failure to graduate from high school (Breslau et al., 
2008; Lee et al., 2009), a key functional impairment, which in the present study helped 
explain the association between CU frequency and a decline in vocabulary by early 
adulthood. These results provide some support for the hypothesis that the link between CU 
and declines in cognitive function could be at least partially because adolescent cannabis 
users are less likely to complete school (e.g., Silins et al., 2014), which in turn has an impact 
on their cognitive development (Brinch & Galloway, 2012). Thus, it could be that the link 
between CU and declines in verbal IQ operates partly through truancy or low levels of 
school engagement (Mokrysz et al., 2016).
Nonetheless, the findings showed that adolescent CU was significantly associated with 
declines in performance on two cognitive tasks, the conditional association and CAPT, even 
after controlling for high school graduation and a number of other important confounders, 
suggesting that declines in performance could potentially be a direct result of CU on the 
developing brain. Note that a decline in performance was observed on the only two tasks in 
our battery that included a learning component, in this case, learning inductively through 
trial and error, a complex cognitive function related to executive function and the prefrontal 
cortices of the brain. It is also notable that, although it may be hard to disentangle the effects 
of age of onset and frequency of use in this sample, the age of onset of CU was associated 
with declines in the CAT (Table 3, Model 1), a finding that was confirmed by group-based 
analyses (see supplementary results and Tables S.3 and S.4 in the supplementary material) 
showing that participants who used cannabis before the age of 16 reported larger declines in 
performance on this task and differed significantly from nonusers. These findings, taken 
together with the finding that CU at 14 years (that remained constant across adolescence) 
was associated with declines in performance on the CAPT, suggest that age of onset does 
matter, providing support for the hypothesis that CU may have more detrimental neurotoxic

 effects on the developing brain of adolescents compared to the those on the adult brain. CU 
during adolescence is hypothesized to lead to alterations in synaptic pruning and a disruption 
of the development of the PFCs, which have a high density of cannabinoid receptors and 
continue to develop during adolescence (Fuhrmann, Knoll, & Blakemore, 201l; Lubman et 
al., 2015; Rubino & Parolaro, 2016). This in turn is hypothesized to impact on cognitive 
function related to prefrontal cortices more than those related to other brain areas. Indirect 
support for this comes from studies showing that early adolescent CU is associated with 
poor white matter integrity in the PFC (Becker, Wagner, Gouzoulis-Mayfrank, Spuentrup, & 
Daumann, 2010a; Gruber, Dahlgren, Sagar, Gonenc, & Lukas, 2014), decreased cortical 
thickness in the superior PFC and frontal cortices (Churchwell, Lopez-Larson, & Yurgelun-
Todd, 2010; Lopez-Larson et al., 2011), and with abnormal brain activation in the PFC and 
parietal brain regions (Becker, Wagner, Gouzoulis-Mayfrank, Spuentrup, & Daumann, 
2010b; Cheng et al., 2014; Jager, Block, Luijten, & Ramsey, 2010).
Further, effects of CU frequency at 14 years that remained stable across adolescence on 
CAPT remained after controlling for change in the CAT (see the Results section in the 
supplementary material). This suggests that early frequent CU may also have effects on 
reward and punishment processing, possibly leading to a failure to modulate behavior in 
light of motivationally significant cues. This is consistent with findings showing that (a) 
chronic CU is associated to poor decision making through a decreased sensitivity to loss and 
greater sensitivity to gains (Fridberg et al., 2010), and alterations in neural activity related to 
the processing of motivation-ally relevant stimuli and errors (Fridberg, Skosnik, Hetrick, & 
O’Donnell, 2013); and (b) CU is associated with reduced gray matter in the OFC 
(particularly the right medial OFC), a brain region involved in reward processing and 
motivation (Churchwell et al., 2010; Filbey et al., 2014).
However, we were unable to confirm whether effects of CU on the CAPT were still 
observable in a sample of abstinent adults as all adolescents who had a CU onset at 14 years 
(n = 27) continued to use cannabis at 20 years. Thus, it was not possible to confirm whether 
the effects of CU frequency at 14 years on decline in performance on the CAPT task were 
due to frequent use (using on average 6 or more times per year) at this age that continued 
across adolescence or to frequent early adolescent use combined with continued active use 
into adulthood. The effects of CU frequency across adolescence on the CAT, however, 
remained even in adults who abstained from CU over the 12 months prior to adult cognitive 
testing, confirming that these effects are not only attributable to concurrent or continued 
active use. This contrasts with conclusions from meta-analyses suggesting that cognitive 
deficits may be recoverable after a month of abstinence (Schreiner & Dunn, 2012; Schulte et 
al., 2014), but is consistent with findings by Meier et al. (2012), which showed that 
persistent moderate- to high-frequency CU from adolescence onward was associated with 
declining NCF in middle-aged adults. However, current results differ from Meier et al. 
(2012), though, in that they do not support that adolescent CU is associated with global 
neurocognitive decline in early adulthood. Instead, they suggest that residual long-term 
effects (as opposed to acute, short-term effects that recover with abstinence) of early-onset 
and frequent adolescent CU, as defined in this sample as going beyond experimentation or 
using 6 times or more over a year, may be limited to NCFs involved in trial and error 
learning. Overall, these results suggest that, in addition to academic failure, fundamental life

 skills necessary for problem solving and daily adaptation, namely, the capacity to learn from 
trial and error and altering an initially rewarded course of action in motivationally significant 
situations, may be affected by early cannabis exposure.
The current findings also highlight the importance of assessing baseline individual 
differences in pre-CU cognitive functions and bidirectional associations between cannabis 
and cognitive function. For example, we found that poor working memory capacity, which 
has been shown to be associated with change in CU frequency and severity (Cousijn et al., 
2014; Squeglia et al., 2014) and other cognitive functions (Carlson, Zelazo, & Faja, 2013), 
significantly predicted earlier onset of CU in this sample of boys. This latter methodological 
point is possibly important for future research. For example, in this sample, higher IQ, not 
lower, was shown to be associated with early onset of CU and a steeper increase in CU 
frequency across adolescence. This is not the first study to show that higher IQ is associated 
with frequent SU in adolescence (Johnson, Hicks, McGue, & Iacono, 2009; White & Batty, 
2012). In another study, which included a different subsample of the MLES study, higher 
verbal IQ was also found to predict alcohol use frequency in early adolescence (Castellanos-
Ryan et al., 2013) and is consistent with the hypothesis that some cognitive abilities may 
facilitate reward-oriented behaviors, including SU (Hyman, Malenka, & Nestler, 2006). 
Taken together, these findings highlight the importance of assessing NCFs more broadly 
before the onset of CU, and of conducting longitudinal studies to help clarify bidirectional 
effects between CU and neurocognitive functioning.
Still, some limitations of the current study should be noted. First, measures of CU quantity 
were unavailable. Future studies should include more sensitive measures of quantity and 
frequency over time to better establish dose–response associations between CU and NCF. 
Second, no biological measures of drug use were obtained, and CU frequency was gathered 
through self-report, which is susceptible to bias and may limit the validity of the data. 
However, studies have shown that self-reports are reliable when assessing SU in adolescence 
(Clark & Winters, 2002) and hence are useful for clinical practice and research. Together 
with guaranteed confidentiality to participants, this should contribute to the reliability and 
validity of these data. Third, although the current study adjusted for effects of alcohol use, 
concurrent CU, and externalizing problems (Tamm et al., 2014), it did not adjust for 
childhood trauma or neglect and other mental health problems that may be associated to CU 
and may be linked to neurocognitive development, such as schizophrenia (Meier et al., 2012, 
did control for this), depression, mania, anxiety, and suicidality (Tamm et al., 2014). Fourth, 
adolescent CU in the current study was assessed during the early 1990s (1991–1995), before 
the observed trend over the last 20 years of increases in the potency of cannabis products 
(ElSohly et al., 2016; Hall & Degenhardt, 2009). Thus, it is possible that more potent 
cannabis products used today, which have a higher content of Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, 
may have greater neurotoxic effects on the brain. Fifth and finally, the current sample was 
made up entirely of French-speaking boys of European American origin living in low-SES 
neighborhoods in Montreal. Thus, replication of these findings is needed with cannabis 
available today, including girls, and more diverse populations.
There have been many recent commentaries highlighting some limitations of the literature 
on the association between CU and neurocognition, as well as highlighting the need for trials

 and longitudinal studies that investigate the effects of CU on the developing brain (e.g., 
Fuhrmann et al., 2015; Volkow et al., 2016). Although the current study cannot address all 
limitations, it does provide further clarity on the potential effects of early frequent CU on 
NCF and their specificity, though it does not demonstrate causality. Nonetheless, it provides 
an additional basis for improving methodology. In the absence of randomized-controlled 
trials, the findings from this prospective longitudinal study provide a clear evidence base for 
directing prevention efforts toward delaying the onset and reducing the frequency of CU, 
particularly in light of the increasing trend of adolescents viewing CU favorably and less 
harmful than other drugs. A number of recent studies have shown that prevention approaches 
that target early risk factors for SU, such as childhood disruptive behaviors and impulsivity, 
have been effective in delaying the onset and reducing the frequency of alcohol and drug use 
during adolescence (Castellanos-Ryan et al., 2013; Conrod, Castellanos-Ryan, & Strang, 
2010).

Note: The sign for the variables that code for errors was changed so that higher scores on any measure indicates better ability. The results using change scores are presented, but analyses using 
neurocognitive residualized scores and baseline scores as covariates were also conducted, with equivalent results. Values in bold indicate that they remain significant after controlling for multiple testing. 
DS, Digit span; SOP, self-ordered pointing; PAL, paired associates learning; CAPT, Card Playing Task. Model fit for Model 1: χ2 (2) = 1.83, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.00, 
comparative fit index (CFI) = 1.00, standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = 0.01; Model 2: χ2 (39) = 94.46, RMSEA = 0.07, CFI = 0.95, SRMR = 0.03; Model 3: χ2 (41) = 101.28, RMSEA = 
0.07, CFI = 0.95, SRMR = 0.03; Model fit for Model 4: χ2 (51) = 101.43, RMSEA =0.06, CFI =0.96, SRMR =0.02. Although only presented under Model 1, standardized coefficients are adjusted for age 
at testing in adulthood; family risk; average academic achievement 13–15; verbal IQ at 13; SOP and PAL at 14; and concurrent cannabis, alcohol, stimulant, and tobacco use frequency at 20 years in all 
models.
aThe verbal IQ change score was calculated by standardizing the sentence completion task (verbal IQ) at 13 years (z scores) and subtracting it from standardized (z-scored) vocabulary scores at 20 years. 
Analyses using change scores computed using the vocabulary subtest at 15 years as baseline scores were equivalent to those reported here (differing only by a few decimals), with analyses yielding 
equivalent results (see Data Preparation and Statistical Analysis section in the online supplementary material).
