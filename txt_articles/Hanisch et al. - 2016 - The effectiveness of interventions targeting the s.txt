Abstract
Background: The majority of people experiencing mental-health problems do not seek help, and the stigma of mental
illness is considered a major barrier to seeking appropriate treatment. More targeted interventions (e.g. at the workplace)
seem to be a promising and necessary supplement to public campaigns, but little is known about their effectiveness.
The aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview of the evidence on the effectiveness of interventions
targeting the stigma of mental illness at the workplace.
Methods: Sixteen studies were included after the literature review. The effectiveness of anti-stigma interventions at the
workplace was assessed by examining changes in: (1) knowledge of mental disorders and their treatment and
recognition of signs/symptoms of mental illness, (2) attitudes towards people with mental-health problems, and
(3) supportive behavior.
Results: The results indicate that anti-stigma interventions at the workplace can lead to improved employee
knowledge and supportive behavior towards people with mental-health problems. The effects of interventions
on employees’ attitudes were mixed, but generally positive. The quality of evidence varied across studies.
Conclusions: This highlights the need for more rigorous, higher-quality evaluations conducted with more diverse
samples of the working population. Future research should explore to what extent changes in employees’ knowledge,
attitudes, and supportive behavior lead to affected individuals seeking help earlier. Such investigations are likely to
inform important stakeholders about the potential benefits of current workplace anti-stigma interventions and provide
guidance for the development and implementation of effective future interventions.

Background
Despite the availability of effective mental-health treat-
ment, the majority of people experiencing mental-health
problems do not seek help. Globally, the number of
people experiencing mental disorders who do not receive
any healthcare treatment is estimated to reach up to 70 %
[1]. This figure is alarming, given the high prevalence of
mental-health problems among the general population
(one in four at some point during their lifetime) [2].
Several factors have been identified that contribute to the
treatment gap between true and treated prevalence: (1)
lack of knowledge of the symptoms of mental illness and
how to access treatment, (2) prejudicial attitudes, and (3)
anticipated or real acts of discrimination against people
who have mental-health problems [3–5]. These factors
combined have been defined as ‘stigma’ [1], which has far-
reaching consequences for those affected.
The level of accurate knowledge about mental illnesses
among the general public has been reported to be rather
low [6]. For example, in a population survey in England,
63 % estimated that less than 10 % of the population would
be likely to experience a mental-health problem at some
time in their lives [7]. However, improved knowledge of

 mental-health problems was shown to have a crucial effect
on the ability to recognize signs of mental illness, as well as
on supporting help-seeking and accepting treatment [8].
Negative attitudes or prejudice refer to negative thoughts
and emotions, such as anxiety or disgust, a majority group
holds against a minority group [1]. This may include public
beliefs concerning mental illness, which often revolve
around dangerousness and incompetence, expectations of
poor prognosis, and a desire for social distance [9].
Discrimination forms the behavioral dimension of stigma
and refers to any acts to the disadvantage of people who
are stigmatized [10]. For example, one study reported that
47 % of the general public would not be willing to work
closely with people diagnosed with depression, and 30 %
would be unwilling to socialize with them [11].
Public stigma as described above can induce ‘self-stigma’
(internalization of stigmatizing attitudes), which results in
diminished self-esteem and self-efficacy in people with
mental-health problems [12]. The adverse effects of stigma
influence various aspects of life and add an additional bur-
den on those already dealing with a mental illness [13]. Per-
haps most devastating is the impact of stigma as a major
barrier to accessing mental-health treatment [14, 15].
Although the stigma of mental illness has been exten-
sively researched among the general population, little is
known about its prevalence and consequences at the work-
place. Some studies suggest that the stigma of mental ill-
ness may also be an important contributing factor to the
underutilization of healthcare services at work [16]. Kim et
al. [17] found that soldiers failed to get treatment for Post-
traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) because they were con-
cerned about being stigmatized by others for having
mental-health problems. Similar results have been obtained
in studies on white-collar workers and the utilization of an
Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Walton [18] found
that employees were worried that their managers would
have a negative opinion of them if they were aware of their
use of mental-health services. Moreover, employees were
reluctant to use counseling services at work if they believed
it would negatively affect their career opportunities [19].
This clearly illustrates that the stigma of mental illness has
a negative impact on the utilization of healthcare services
at work and results in employees waiting until their symp-
toms severely interfere with their daily functioning instead
of seeking support early [20]. Stigma not only poses a bar-
rier to mental-health treatment after the onset of illness,
but also interferes with prevention efforts during early
stages of the illness [21].
The debilitating impact of mental illness at work is widely
recognized, and resulting total work loss due to absentee-
ism, presenteeism, and turnover is estimated to cost organi-
zations in the UK £26 billion a year [22]. Given the high
prevalence of mental-health problems in the general and
working population, the workplace is increasingly being
recognized as an important target of mental-health promo-
tion, prevention, and interventions [23]. Those efforts may
remain ineffective if stigma is not removed and a supportive
work environment is not created. Therefore, effective strat-
egies to reduce the stigma of mental illness and to increase
help-seeking behavior at the workplace are needed. Unfor-
tunately, research on their effectiveness is scarce and pre-
sents inconclusive evidence in this field [23, 24].
Although six systematic reviews investigating anti-stigma
reduction programs have been conducted, none of them fo-
cused specifically on workplace interventions [25–30]. Two
non-systematic reviews of current workplace anti-stigma
programs were published, but they were mainly conceptual
in nature rather than evaluating the effectiveness of the in-
terventions [23, 24]. Insight in improve existing efforts in
the development of targeted workplace anti-stigma inter-
ventions is sorely lacking.
Such an investigation could inform important stake-
holders about the effectiveness of current workplace anti-
stigma interventions and their potential benefits in terms of
an inferred impact on utilization rates of healthcare services
(e.g. workplace counselling/EAP etc.) and on employee
mental health. Such investigations could strengthen the in-
centive for organizations to invest in stigma-reduction ef-
forts while providing guidance for the development and
implementation of effective future interventions.
Therefore, based on the conceptual framework of stigma
by Thornicroft [1] as described earlier, this review aims to
provide a first systematic review on the effectiveness of
workplace anti-stigma interventions by examining changes
in: (1) knowledge of mental disorders and their treatment
and recognition of signs/symptoms of mental illness, (2) at-
titudes towards people with mental-health problems, and
(3) supportive behavior among colleagues (e.g. reduced dis-
criminatory or increased affirmative behavior, help seeking,
etc.). We chose to adhere to this conceptualization be-
cause, in contrast to the majority of evaluation studies, we
wanted to place particular emphasis on measuring behav-
ioral outcomes of stigma-reduction programs and help-
seeking [3, 28, 31].
Methods
A systematic literature review on the effectiveness of
workplace anti-stigma interventions was carried out after
methods of the analysis and inclusion criteria had been
specified in a protocol.
Eligibility criteria
For detailed information on eligibility criteria, please
refer to Additional file 1 in the supplementary material.
Study designs of interest
Randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental stud-
ies were included, while longitudinal studies, cohort studies,
Hanisch et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:1 
Page 2 of 11
 primary prevention studies, phase-I and II studies, ecologic
studies, case reports, case series, cross-sectional studies,
and qualitative and economic evaluations were excluded
from the analysis. This is because, in contrast to previous
descriptive reviews on anti-stigma interventions, this review
aimed to focus exclusively on evaluating the effectiveness of
workplace anti-stigma programs and, thus, only included
experimental studies which provided quantitative evidence.
Study participants
Participants aged 18–65 in the working population were
considered. Studies that targeted mental healthcare pro-
viders were excluded from this review because this occu-
pational group already has extensive knowledge of and
contact with people with mental-health problems. Pre-
liminary evidence suggests that this group might be fun-
damentally different in their responses to anti-stigma
interventions than people working outside of healthcare
[32]. Studies targeting self-stigma in clinical patients
were also excluded.
Types of interventions
All types of interventions targeting stigma against men-
tal illness at the workplace were considered for the
current review. Studies were included if they met the fol-
lowing criteria: (1) included an intervention that targeted
at least one dimension of stigma as an outcome (any
variables related to either knowledge and/or attitude
and/or behavior were considered), (2) included an evaluation
of the intervention, and (3) the evaluation was quantitative.
This meant that programs which targeted any dimension of
stigma were included, even though they couldn’t necessarily
be considered anti-stigma programs per se.
Studies were excluded if they met the following cri-
teria: (1) self-stigma in clinical patients was targeted, (2)
did not include an evaluation of the intervention, or (3)
presented only qualitative evaluation data.
Information sources
Medline and PsycINFO were searched for peer-reviewed
articles related to workplace anti-stigma interventions car-
ried out between 2004 and 2014. This time span was con-
sidered exhaustive enough to include the most recent
efforts, as well as those started ten years ago. Only papers
in the English, German, Spanish, or Portuguese languages
could be read and were selected. References in relevant ar-
ticles were also screened for publications that might be ac-
ceptable for inclusion. An additional Google Scholar
search was made to identify relevant grey literature, which
is either unpublished or not published in peer-reviewed
journals. Experts at the Mental Health Commission of
Canada were also consulted for the potential inclusion of
unpublished articles.
The last search was run on July 1, 2014.
Search strategy (see Additional file 1)
The search strategy was reviewed independently by sub-
ject experts/librarians at the University of Calgary (for full
database search strategies, please check the appendix).
The following terms were used to search all trial registers
and databases: stigma-related terms AND mental health-
related terms AND workplace-related terms AND pro-
gram evaluation-related terms. Limitations were applied
with regards to restrictions in type of study design and
type of participants as described above, as well as to stud-
ies on stigma related to physical health conditions or in-
terventions aiming to reduce drug use (e.g. smoking
cessation) unless they provided a quantitative measure on
stigma related to drug use and didn’t target healthcare
providers.

 Study selection
An eligibility assessment of abstracts and full-text papers
was performed in a standardized manner by the lead au-
thor (SH), and 20 % of total citations were double checked
independently by a second reviewer (CT). Disagreements
between reviewers were followed up by double checks and
resolved by discussion.
Data extraction
Data on study design, sample characteristics, and findings
were extracted by two reviewers (SH, CT) independently
(CT double extracted 31 % of total full-text inclusions).
The following information was extracted from each in-
cluded study: (1) objectives, (2) general information (study
design, country of origin, number and duration of follow-
ups), (3) study population (age, sample size, percentage of
female participants, target population), (4) workplace
(workplace name, workplace sector, workplace type, job,
(5) type of intervention (duration, frequency, target in
terms of primary- and secondary- outcome measures, and
whether the intervention addressed general mental health
or a specific mental illness), and (6) intervention effective-
ness (in terms of a change in outcome measures with ef-
fect sizes where reported). No further variables were
added to those already pre-specified in the protocol after
the review had begun.
Study quality
For all included studies (including grey literature), meth-
odological quality was assessed using a checklist for
randomized controlled trials and quasi-experiments
[33]. This checklist involved an assessment of four
kinds of systematic errors (detection, selection, attri-
tion, and information bias) among a rating scale of
low, moderate, or high risk. Two authors (SH, CT)
independently rated all studies according to those cri-
teria and resolved discrepancies through discussion. If
no agreement could be reached, a third author was
consulted.
Data analyses
A narrative synthesis following the guideline proposed by
Popay et al. [34] was undertaken since a meta-analysis of
results was not possible due to substantial differences in
methodology and outcome data across studies. This in-
volved addressing four main elements of narrative synthe-
sis: a) developing a theory of how the intervention works,
why, and for whom, b) developing a preliminary synthesis
of findings of included studies, c) exploring relationships
within and between studies, and d) assessing the robust-
ness of the synthesis. Extracted information was summa-
rized using the tabular form of the Cochrane review’s
‘Characteristics of Included Studies’ table (participants, in-
terventions,
outcomes,
notes)
with
the
inclusion
of
additional information (country of origin, duration of the
intervention, target, assessment time points, control group,
study design, and the context in which the intervention
was delivered).
Results
Study selection
The study selection process was carried out according to
the PRISMA guidelines on reporting items for systematic
reviews [35]. Appropriate studies were identified in
Medline and PsycINFO (yielded 758 citations), while
36 additional citations were identified searching Goo-
gle Scholar, consulting experts of the Mental Health
Commission of Canada, and by checking the refer-
ences of relevant papers. Seven hundred seventy-three
studies remained after duplicates were removed. Seven
hundred eleven were excluded since they clearly did not
meet the criteria after abstract review. After reviewing the
full text of the remaining 62 citations, 46 studies were
excluded for specific reasons which are listed in the
flow chart (see Fig. 1). Sixteen studies were eventually
included in the review.
Study characteristics
For detailed information on study characteristics, please
see Additional file 2 in the supplementary material.
Study designs
Of the 16 included studies, five were RCTs, and 11 were
quasi-experimental studies. Seven studies included a con-
trol group. All studies were published in English.
Settings and populations
The included studies involved 3854 participants. The ma-
jority of studies targeted the public sector (12), only two
the private sector, and no information on the type of work-
place was given for another two. Regarding study popula-
tions, most studies examined interventions for managers
or supervisors, as well as first responders, such as police of-
ficers. Two studies [36, 37] examined interventions in em-
ployees routinely working with people with mental-health
problems (e.g. housing agencies). Six studies were con-
ducted in Europe, five in the US or Canada, four in
Australia, and one in Asia.
Interventions
Eight studies assessed the impact of Mental Health First
Aid (MHFA) training or a modified version of the pro-
gram on one or more dimensions of stigma. While MHFA
is primarily seen to be a mental-health literacy program,
they do measure stigma and were therefore included [24].
The remaining eight studies included heterogeneous inter-
ventions, such as role play, online training, psychoeduca-
tion, workshops, Trauma Risk Management (TRiM), and
Hanisch et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:1

 Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) in first responders. Half
of the studies targeted all three dimensions of stigma (i.e.
knowledge, attitudes, behavior), while the other half spe-
cifically targeted attitudes or behavior. The duration of the
interventions varied between a minimum of 1 hour up to
a maximum of 2 days.
Outcomes
Primary
In all studies the primary outcome was a change in at least
one dimension of stigma, namely knowledge and/or atti-
tude and/or behavior. While studies differed with regards
to the operationalization of variables for knowledge,
attitude, and behavior outcomes, data collection and in-
struments used to assess change over time were fairly
similar across studies.
Secondary
Secondary outcomes included change in participants’
overall mental health [38, 39]. One study examined
readiness to provide actual help to people with men-
tal disorders as the primary outcome while analyzing
knowledge, attitudes, and self-confidence in helping a
person with a mental disorder as secondary outcomes
[40]. One study assessed the cost-effectiveness of the
intervention [41].

 Study quality
In general, all studies included were considered at high
risk for detection bias, as at least one dimension of stigma
was measured by self-reports (which is, however, fairly
standard and about the only feasible way to measure atti-
tudes). With regards to selection, attrition, and informa-
tion bias, the majority of studies was at high risk of bias
due to selective reporting, lack of allocation concealment,
lack of participant blinding, and incomplete outcome data.
While five studies received an overall rating of low risk for
bias, no study had only low risk of bias ratings for the type
of bias described above.
Effectiveness of anti-stigma interventions
See Table 1 for a summary of results of the included stud-
ies with regards to intervention effectiveness (for reported
effect sizes, please refer to Additional file 3).
Knowledge
Eleven studies targeted ‘knowledge’
, including a) the iden-
tification of mental-health problems and b) knowledge
about effective treatments.
Ten anti-stigma interventions were shown to be effect-
ive in increasing mental-health knowledge with one ex-
ception. In this study, MHFA training did not result in
improved mental-health literacy in the intervention as op-
posed to the control group [38]. However, since recogni-
tion of a mental disorder in a vignette task was already
fairly high in the pre-test, this left limited room for im-
provement post intervention. Six studies with high risk of
bias had a positive impact on mental-health literacy [36,
42–46]. Nevertheless, the impact of their evidence is
weaker given the absence of a control group, the lack of
randomization procedures, and a high risk of selection
bias (e.g. participation in the intervention was voluntary).
These findings are supported by other studies of moderate-
to-high quality, which confirms a significant positive effect
of workplace anti-stigma interventions on employees’
mental-health knowledge [40, 47–49].
Attitudes
Fourteen studies measured stigmatizing attitudes or open-
ness towards people or coworkers with mental illness,
often using social-distance scales. One study examined
specific attitudes related to perceived dangerousness, un-
predictability, and recovery of mentally-ill individuals [36].
Another study differentiated between first- and third-
person viewpoints with regards to stigma [37].
Although the effectiveness of interventions on changing
attitudes was mixed, nine studies did report improvements
in participants’ stigmatizing attitudes. Next to the MHFA
training, the other types of anti-stigma interventions, such
as TRiM, CIT, online training, and workshops, were effect-
ive in reducing stigmatizing attitudes towards people with
mental-health problems. Of the six studies with low-to-
moderate risk for bias, four reported a significant positive

 effect on participants’ attitudes [38, 39, 48, 49], while two
did not note any significant changes [40, 47]. However,
while Svensson, Hansson [40] found no overall significant
change in attitudes, their analyses of specific items on their
stigma scales did reveal positive improvements (e.g. items
related to personal stigma, as well as becoming a neighbor
of a person with depression). With regards to more specific
attitudinal changes, Knifton et al. [36] found particular im-
provement in relation to unpredictability and recovery, but
not for dangerousness.
Behavior
Eleven studies targeted ‘behavior’. Behavior was operation-
alized in a heterogeneous manner across studies, including
both true behavioral measures and proxies. In general,
behavioral change was related to increased affirmative be-
havior, as well as to reductions in discriminatory behavior.
All types of anti-stigma interventions in 11 studies
(three rated as of high quality) consistently had a signifi-
cant positive impact on employees’ supportive behavior
[36, 38, 40–43, 45, 46, 49, 50] with the exception of one
study [47], which reported a marginally significant effect.
More specifically, this involved, for example, perceived
confidence and self-efficacy in identifying and dealing with
a person with a mental illness, as well as the likelihood of
advising people to seek professional help and readiness to
provide help in mental-health situations. One study in-
volving police officers examined directly measured behav-
iors, such as the use of force [41].
In one study, role play was used to achieve behavioral
change. Although not intended, the intervention also had
a positive effect of mental-health knowledge [41]. Simi-
larly, Moffitt et al. [48] observed a change in behavior
achieved by an intervention that targeted knowledge and
attitude only.
Secondary outcomes
Two studies of moderate to high quality examined par-
ticipant mental health as a secondary outcome and re-
ported a positive impact of the anti-stigma intervention
[38, 39]. The study including a cost-effectiveness analysis
found its anti-stigma intervention (i.e. role play) to be
cost-effective [41].
Sustainability of change
Eleven studies did not include any follow-up measure-
ments beyond the initial two time points (pre-post). This
limits the conclusions that can be drawn relating to the
effectiveness of anti-stigma interventions over the long
term. Five studies conducted a post-intervention follow-
up of up to 2 years [39, 40, 47, 49, 51]. All these studies
report that the changes achieved in either people’s know-
ledge and/or attitudes and/or behavior post-intervention
were, in part, sustained over time. For example, Svensson,
Hansson [40] found a significant improvement in know-
ledge and confidence to provide help, but not in atti-
tudes, and this pattern remained unchanged at a 2-year
follow-up.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to
examine the effectiveness of interventions targeting stigma
towards mental illness at the workplace. The majority of
the included studies were published since 2010, reflecting a
growing interest in evaluations of stigma-reduction pro-
grams at the workplace. Our review illustrates that
workplace anti-stigma interventions may be effective in
changing employees’ knowledge, attitudes, and behavior to-
wards people with mental-health problems. However, due
to methodological shortcomings in the majority of the
included studies, the lack of follow-ups beyond post-
intervention assessments, as well as heterogeneity in terms
of intervention content, duration, and outcome mea-
sures, the evidence for the effectiveness of workplace
anti-stigma interventions is inconclusive and must be
interpreted with caution.
While prior systematic reviews of general population in-
terventions corroborate our findings of poor evaluation
study design, they also found stigma-reduction efforts to
be effective in changing people’s knowledge, attitudes, and
behaviors towards people with mental-health problems
[25–29]. The development and implementation of effect-
ive anti-stigma programs specifically designed for the
workplace is, however, of high importance. First, while
public efforts have returned mixed results, the develop-
ment of tailored strategies targeting the workplace might
prove a more promising route to stigma change, as aware-
ness of public campaigns has often been found to be quite
low [24, 52]. Thus, while public anti-stigma efforts target
a greater part of the population, more people might be
reached effectively via more targeted interventions (e.g. at
work). Second, participation in anti-stigma programs, for
example in the scope of personnel development, could be
made mandatory in an organizational setting, whereas
public stigma campaigns require people to participate vol-
untarily. Third, by nature, exposure to mass-media ap-
proaches to stigma change can be short in time, whereas
workplace interventions can be more intensive in terms of
length and information.
Our review shows that workplace anti-stigma interven-
tions can be particularly effective in changing employees’
knowledge of mental disorders, as well as helping behav-
ior, while results related to attitudinal change were mixed,
but positive overall. In two studies [41, 48], a spillover ef-
fect was identified, meaning that a change in one outcome
measure (e.g. behavior) occurred even though the inter-
vention exclusively targeted other outcomes (e.g. know-
ledge or attitudes). This implies that the three dimensions
Hanisch et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:1 
Page 7 of 11
 of stigma (knowledge, attitude, and behavior) might be in-
terrelated, as has been suggested before [53]. The theory
of health education [54] postulates that attitude mediates
the relationship between knowledge and behavior. In con-
trast, the current review showed that attitudinal change is
not required to achieve behavioral change. In line with
prior research [47, 55], three studies found that knowledge
might directly trigger a behavior under certain conditions,
even without any attitudinal change [40, 43, 45]. However,
further research into how anti-stigma interventions change
or affect each of the three dimensions of stigma is required
to fully understand the stigmatization process.
The debilitating impact of mental illness at work is
widely recognized, and organizations are increasingly
investing in workplace mental-health interventions. How-
ever, emerging evidence indicates that stigma towards
mental illness, in part, contributes to the underutilization
of costly mental-health services (e.g. EAP, workplace
counseling) that are already offered by organizations [16,
18]. It is, therefore, important to address and remove
stigma as a barrier to increase the effectiveness and ‘value-
for-money’ of these interventions.
This review addresses the research gap regarding the be-
havioral dimension of stigma as an outcome and, more
importantly, highlights that workplace anti-stigma inter-
ventions have the potential to change employee behavior
[3]. In contrast, anti-stigma campaigns targeting the gen-
eral public have often failed to change behavior [56]. Per-
haps in an organizational context as compared to the
public context, behavioral change (e.g. in supportive or
help-seeking behavior) could be achieved more readily by
giving clear calls for action in specific situations at work.
This has important practical implications for organiza-
tions and employers alike, as behavioral change is consid-
ered the ultimate goal of efforts to reduce stigma and is
likely to result in a more supportive work environment,
which, in turn, is a necessary prerequisite for the success
of any mental-health intervention (e.g. workplace counsel-
ing, EAP) [53, 57].
In light of the impact of stigma on seeking help and ac-
counting for the fact that a large proportion of people ex-
periencing mental-health problems do not seek help, it is
essential to measure the impact of anti-stigma interven-
tions on help-seeking behavior [58]. Despite the heterogen-
eity in the operationalization of behavior, however, none of
the included studies examined help-seeking behavior as an
outcome, focusing instead on potential intervention effects
on participants’ supportive behavior towards afflicted indi-
viduals. Future evaluations of workplace anti-stigma inter-
ventions should place stronger emphasis on assessing a
potential impact on employees’ help-seeking behavior (e.g.
health-service utilization), as well as on their mental health
(e.g. sick leave, presenteeism). This would help assess the
cost-effectiveness of workplace anti-stigma interventions
and strengthen the economic incentive for organizations to
invest in stigma-reduction efforts.
The current review found some evidence indicating the
positive impact of anti-stigma interventions on partici-
pants’ general mental health [36, 37]. Improved knowledge
of signs of mental illness and treatment options may lead
employees to seek help earlier. This is supported by find-
ings of a prior meta-analysis, which found that MHFA
training helped improve participant mental health by im-
proving self-recognition, increasing insight into one’s own
and others’ mental well-being, and by increasing coping
skills [30]. Workplace anti-stigma interventions might not
only create a more supportive work environment by redu-
cing stigmatizing attitudes and discrimination, but also lead
to improved knowledge and awareness of mental illness
and to improved employee mental health via increased and
potentially earlier help-seeking. So far, economic evalua-
tions of anti-stigma interventions are generally lacking;
however, preliminary evidence indicates a potential return
on investment for employers [59].
While the evaluated anti-stigma interventions themselves
seem to be scientifically sound in terms of their theoretical
background and content, the evaluation methods used need
to be improved substantially. A prominent finding of this re-
view was the large number of studies with methodological
shortcomings, high risk of bias, no control groups, and small
sample sizes. Studies frequently also reported high levels of
dropouts and varied in terms of program completion. A po-
tential reason for this might be the challenge of evaluating
interventions in a scientifically sound manner in companies
which might be unwilling to engage in such research or pose
restrictions due to data-protection rights.
The current review further highlights a misfit between
what some intervention studies claimed to target and what
they actually assessed in terms of outcomes [41, 48]. If
studies fail to assess the impact on outcomes they claim to
target in their intervention, important evaluation data gets
lost. Studies targeting and assessing a change in only one
dimension of stigma (e.g. attitude) might fail to detect a
spillover effect on other dimensions of stigma (e.g. know-
ledge or behavior).
Previous research has questioned the retention of inter-
vention effects over time, especially with regards to attitu-
dinal and behavioral change [28, 29]. The majority of
studies in this review did not conduct a follow-up assess-
ment of intervention effects. However, where reported,
improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and behavior were
maintained over time [39, 40, 47, 49, 51]. Future research
needs to place greater emphasis on conducting follow-up
evaluations that go beyond pre-post measurements.
Limitations
Although this review generated important findings, there
are several limitations that should be mentioned. First,
Hanisch et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:1 
Page 8 of 11
 only three electronic databases were used to gather arti-
cles for this review, and a search in languages other than
English, German, Portuguese, and Spanish was not under-
taken. Despite the lack of breadth, the searches were sup-
plemented
by
searching
Google
Scholar,
checking
references,
and
communication
with
experts,
which
yielded 14 further studies, three of which were unpub-
lished. The possibility of publication bias needs to be con-
sidered, as there may have been relevant studies that did
not produce positive results and, consequently, were not
published.
A second limitation of the current review involves
generalizability of the current findings. The majority of par-
ticipants in the reviewed studies were well-educated em-
ployees, such as managers. This limits the generalizability
of the findings to other occupations or sectors that employ
less-educated workers (e.g. service industries). While it
makes sense to address managers due to their supervisory
role and their importance in recognizing and dealing with
signs of mental illness in subordinates, it may be just as im-
portant to target less-educated workers because there is
some evidence indicating that less-educated compared to
more-educated people are more likely to hold stigmatizing
attitudes towards people with mental illnesses [60]. It is also
important to note that all of the studies included in this
review were carried out in high-income countries and,
therefore, the findings may not apply to low- and
middle-income countries, where stigma towards mental
illness might be particularly strong or prevailing.
This review provides a narrative synthesis of the evi-
dence of anti-stigma intervention effectiveness rather
than a meta-analysis of results, which limits the strength
of the conclusions that can be drawn. Given the hetero-
geneity of the methodology and outcome data across
studies, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis at
this time.
Implications for future research
It was beyond the scope of the current review to identify
which types or components of anti-stigma interventions
are particularly effective in improving employees’ know-
ledge, attitudes, and behavior. Future research should
compare and contrast different types of anti-stigma inter-
ventions to determine the optimal program content and
duration for the workplace context. Although a positive
impact was found in all types of anti-stigma interventions
studied, it is crucial to emphasize a stronger evaluation
methodology as much as improving anti-stigma content.
Future research in this field should engage in more stan-
dardized, high-quality evaluations which measure all di-
mensions of stigma towards mental illness to better
understand the potential impact of anti-stigma interven-
tions at the workplace. This would allow researchers to
compare quantitative measures of stigma across studies
more easily and to conduct a meta-analysis which would
help build a stronger evidence base for the effectiveness of
workplace anti-stigma interventions.
To increase the generalizability of the current findings,
anti-stigma interventions with larger, more diverse samples
in terms of gender, race, socioeconomic status, education/
hierarchy, geographic location, and type of workplace
should be tested.
Conclusions
This review systematically examined the effectiveness of
interventions targeting stigma towards mental illness at
the workplace. There is tentative evidence that workplace
anti-stigma interventions can have a positive impact on
employees’ knowledge, attitudes, and supportive behavior
towards people with mental illness. The quality of evi-
dence varied across studies, highlighting the need for
more rigorous, higher-quality evaluations conducted with
more diverse samples of the working population.
Future research needs to explore to what extent changes
in employees’ knowledge, attitudes, and supportive behav-
ior translate into increased and earlier help-seeking by af-
fected individuals. Such investigation is likely to inform
important stakeholders, like human-resources or health-
management personnel, about the beneficial impact of
stigma-reduction programs on the effectiveness or accept-
ance of already existing mental-health interventions and,
ultimately, on employee mental health.
