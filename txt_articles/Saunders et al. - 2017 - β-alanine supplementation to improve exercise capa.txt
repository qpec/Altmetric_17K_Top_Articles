ABSTRACT
Objective To conduct a systematic review and meta-
analysis of the evidence on the effects of β-alanine
supplementation on exercise capacity and performance.
Design This study was designed in accordance with
PRISMA guidelines. A 3-level mixed effects model was
employed to model effect sizes and account for
dependencies within data.
Data sources 3 databases (PubMed, Google Scholar,
Web of Science) were searched using a number of terms
(‘β-alanine’ and ‘Beta-alanine’ combined with
‘supplementation’, ‘exercise’, ‘training’, ‘athlete’,
‘performance’ and ‘carnosine’).
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Inclusion/
exclusion criteria limited articles to double-blinded,
placebo-controlled studies investigating the effects of
β-alanine supplementation on an exercise measure. All
healthy participant populations were considered, while
supplementation protocols were restricted to chronic
ingestion. Cross-over designs were excluded due to the
long washout period for skeletal muscle carnosine
following supplementation. A single outcome measure
was extracted for each exercise protocol and converted
to effect sizes for meta-analyses.
Results 40 individual studies employing 65 different
exercise protocols and totalling 70 exercise measures in
1461 participants were included in the analyses.
A significant overall effect size of 0.18 (95% CI 0.08 to
0.28) was shown. Meta-regression demonstrated that
exercise duration significantly (p=0.004) moderated
effect sizes. Subgroup analyses also identified the type of
exercise as a significant (p=0.013) moderator of effect
sizes within an exercise time frame of 0.5–10 min with
greater effect sizes for exercise capacity (0.4998 (95% CI
0.246 to 0.753)) versus performance (0.1078 (95% CI
−0.201 to 0.416)). There was no moderating effect of
training status (p=0.559), intermittent or continuous
exercise (p=0.436) or total amount of β-alanine
ingested (p=0.438). Co-supplementation with sodium
bicarbonate resulted in the largest effect size when
compared with placebo (0.43 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.64)).
Summary/conclusions β-alanine had a significant
overall effect while subgroup analyses revealed a number
of modifying factors. These data allow individuals to
make informed decisions as to the likelihood of an
ergogenic effect with β-alanine supplementation based
on their chosen exercise modality.
INTRODUCTION
The purported pleiotropic effects of carnosine
(β-alanyl-L-histidine) have attracted interest in this
histidine-containing dipeptide in recent years due
to its potential ergogenic and therapeutic benefits.1
Its abundance in skeletal muscle suggests that it
plays an important role during exercise, with a key
physiological role considered to be intracellular
acid–base regulation, although further roles for car-
nosine have also been suggested, such as protection
against oxidative damage, glycation and regulation
of calcium sensitivity (for review, see ref. 2). The
rate limiting factor to muscle carnosine synthesis is
the availability of β-alanine from the diet,3 with
supplementation shown to increase skeletal muscle
concentrations in the upper and lower limbs.3–9
This has led to investigations into the effects of
β-alanine
supplementation,
and
thus
increased
muscle carnosine concentration, on capacity and
performance within a variety of exercise tests and
sample populations.
A previous meta-analysis10 showed the efficacy of
β-alanine supplementation on exercise with a sig-
nificant effect on capacity but not performance
tests, although the authors acknowledged that this
might have been due to the lack of studies employ-
ing a performance measure at the time. The exer-
cise time frame in which β-alanine was most
effective was 1–4 min, with no effect on exercise of
<1 min in duration. Although a positive effect was
shown on exercise of more than 4 min in duration,
there was a lack of protocols employing long-
duration continuous exercise; the majority of the
longer duration exercise studies employed incre-
mental protocols of such low intensity during the
initial stages that they were unlikely to produce any
significant changes that result in fatigue. Therefore,
the duration of such tests is somewhat deceptive
since it is only the latter stages that may be suscep-
tible to changes in muscle carnosine with supple-
mentation. Furthermore, in line with the primary
suggested role of muscle carnosine, a 0.5–10 min
time frame may be more appropriate since acidosis
following 20 s of exercise may already contribute
to fatigue,11 while exercise of 7–8 min in duration
has been shown to have a high contribution from
glycolytic energy sources.12 Thus, determination of
the effect of β-alanine within these different exer-
cise durations would further contribute to the evi-
dence base as to the main physiological role of
carnosine in skeletal muscle during exercise.
It would be of interest to investigate the ability
of β-alanine to improve exercise measures in differ-
ent
sample
populations
(ie,
trained
and
non-
trained) and exercise modes (ie, whole body and
isolated limb exercise) since its efficacy for trained
individuals13 14 and whole body exercise has been

 questioned.15 Furthermore, since over half of professional foot-
ballers reported taking β-alanine,16 determination of its effect
on intermittent as well as continuous exercise is warranted.
Additionally, since muscle carnosine increases are dose depend-
ent,17 it appears reasonable to suggest that the total amount
ingested or supplementation duration may influence any exercise
gains. Co-supplementation of β-alanine with sodium bicarbonate
may lead to additive gains via increased intracellular (from
increased muscle carnosine concentrations) and extracellular
(from increased blood bicarbonate concentrations) buffering
capacity.18 Therefore, it would be of interest to determine the
effect of co-supplementation of β-alanine with sodium bicarbon-
ate to determine whether any improvements are additive and
exceed those with β-alanine alone.
The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and
meta-analysis on the effects of β-alanine supplementation,
accounting for a number of potential modifying factors includ-
ing exercise duration, type and mode, sample population, total
amount ingested and study length. Furthermore, the combined
effects
of
sodium
bicarbonate
and
β-alanine
were
also
investigated.
METHODS
Study eligibility
The protocol for this study was designed in accordance with
PRISMA guidelines,19 and the question determined in respect
of PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator and Outcomes).
The population included healthy human males and females of
any age. Recreationally active and professional athletes were
considered for inclusion. Studies conducted with diseased-state
participants
were
excluded.
The
intervention
must
have
employed a chronic (>1 day) β-alanine supplementation proto-
col. Since the net retention of β-alanine used for muscle carno-
sine synthesis over 4 weeks of supplementation is 6.0–6.5%
over the dose range 3.2–6.4 g/day (estimated from refs. 3, 20),
acute supplementation protocols were not included since a
single dose of β-alanine would not result in any meaningful
increases in muscle carnosine. No cross-over designs were
included in the analyses if they did not demonstrate a complete
washout of muscle carnosine, given the long washout period for
muscle carnosine (up to 16 weeks) following doses of between
1.6 and 4.8 g/day of β-alanine.6 17 Although Danaher et al21
reported no significant differences in muscle carnosine concen-
tration following 12 weeks of washout, a lack of statistical sig-
nificance
does
not
exclude
the
possibility
that
carnosine
remained elevated in some individuals. Thus, following a discus-
sion and agreement between all reviewers, this study was not
included in any of the analyses. In relation to the comparator,
the protocol for this study determined that only double-blinded,
placebo-controlled studies were included. Studies that reported
on outcomes based on exercise performance and capacity were
considered for inclusion. For the purpose of this review, exercise
capacity tests were defined as those requiring exertion to the
point of volitional fatigue, while performance-based tests were
defined as those requiring pacing strategies that may not neces-
sarily elicit maximal exertion. Only peer-reviewed, original
human studies published between 2002 and February 2016
were included within this review. W
e applied a date restriction
of 2002 to coincide with the publication of the first paper to
investigate the association between muscle carnosine and exer-
cise.22 Where data were incomplete, authors were contacted to
obtain the relevant information. Data from one study were not
received,23 meaning that this study was not included in the
analyses.
Search strategy and quality assessment
An electronic search of the literature was undertaken by BS
using three databases (PubMed, Google Scholar and W
eb of
Science) to identify all relevant articles. The search terms
‘β-alanine’ and ‘beta-alanine’ were individually concatenated
with ‘supplementation’, ‘exercise’, ‘training’, ‘athlete’, ‘perform-
ance’ and ‘carnosine’; search terms were restricted to the title of
the articles. Following the removal of duplicates, a two-phase
search strategy was subsequently employed by three independ-
ent reviewers (BS, GGA and KES). Phase one assessed the eligi-
bility of the title and abstract of every hit generated from the
search terms against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Studies that
had questionable suitability were included at this stage and the
final decision was reached at the next phase (phase 2). In phase
2, full articles were retrieved and assessed against the eligibility
criteria. Reference lists of relevant original and review articles
were screened to ensure that all relevant studies were included.
Any differences of opinion relating to study eligibility were
resolved through discussion. The search strategy is summarised
in figure 1. The final search was completed in February 2016.
A funnel plot (see online supplementary figure S1) was used
to visually determine publication bias; BS and BG performed
this according to standard recommendations.24 Some data
appeared to contribute to some asymmetry in the plot, with one
study having a very low sample size (β-alanine only group
(BA)=5, placebo group (PL)=2).25 High standard errors shown
for the other two26 27 are most likely due to high interindivi-
dual responses within the respective studies. It was concluded
that there was no publication bias and inclusion of all study esti-
mates was warranted. BS and KES independently reviewed the
strength of the evidence provided by all studies using the criteria
outlined in the Consolidated Standards of reporting Trials
(CONSORT statement;28
29 online supplementary table S1).
Any differences between reviewers were resolved by discussion
until an agreement was reached. Items 3b, 6b, 7b, 14a, 14b,
17b, 18, 23 and 24 were removed, as they were not applicable
to any of the studies. The results of the CONSORT assessment
were not used to exclude any study that did not meet the stan-
dards or requirements but provide an objective measure of each
study’s adherence to the minimum set of recommendations for
reporting randomised trials as determined by CONSORT
.
Data extraction and variable categorisation
Data extraction was conducted by BS using a standardised and
prepiloted data extraction form. A number of protocols resulted
in several outcome measures of the same exercise test; in order
to avoid duplication bias, only a solitary outcome measure from
each exercise protocol was included. Thus, where a single exer-
cise protocol resulted in one or more outcome measures, the
outcome measure included was based on a hierarchy agreed on
by all reviewers to ensure consistency in data extraction. Data
were extracted according to availability, prioritising exercise
measures over physiological measures, according to the follow-
ing hierarchical profile:
1. Total work done;
2. Mean output throughout the test (ie, mean power output;
mean velocity; mean height);
3. Time to completion (performance test)/time to exhaustion
(capacity test);
4. Oxygen
consumption
(ie,
maximal
(VO2max)
or
peak
(VO2peak) oxygen uptake).
Where multiple time points following supplementation existed
(ie, 0–4 and 0–10 weeks), postsupplementation outcome data

 were extracted from the final time point available. This was per-
formed to ensure the highest possible accumulation of muscle
carnosine due to β-alanine supplementation and thus, theoretic-
ally, the most likely time point to show any effect.
Following extraction, data were allocated into categories to
allow for subgroup analyses. This included separating data by
exercise
duration
according
to
the
approach
of
Hobson
et al10 (duration 1), namely 0–1 min, 1–4 min and in excess of
4 min, which were chosen to consider the proposed phy-
siological mechanisms of carnosine, in particular pH buffering.
Additional subgroup analyses were performed according to exer-
cise duration using the following categories (duration 2):
0–0.5 min; 0.5–10 min; 10 min+. The lower limit was chosen
since Bogdanis et al11 suggested that sprint performance may be
affected by the acidosis that occurred during the initial 20 s of
exercise. Although maximal H+ accumulation in blood occurs
after ∼4 min,30 total anaerobic energy contribution during the
4 km cycling time trial (lasting ∼6 min) is ∼25%,31 while
Stellingwerff et al12 showed that non-oxidative glycolysis contri-
butes ∼12% towards total energy contribution during 2000 m
rowing (lasting in excess of 7 min). Thus, to ensure inclusion of
all exercise with a substantial contribution from anaerobic
energy sources, an upper limit of 10 min was determined. All
exercise in excess of 10 min, with a likely predominantly
aerobic energy contribution, made up the final category.
Exercise protocols were categorised according to whether
they measured exercise capacity or performance (exercise type).
Capacity tests require exertion to the point of volitional exhaus-
tion, resulting in a maximal production of H+, whereas per-
formance tests rely more on pacing strategies that might not
elicit maximal exertion.32 Analyses also separated investigations
according to the sample populations recruited to the study
(training status), since it has been suggested that trained indivi-
duals may be less responsive to β-alanine supplementation.13 14
Studies were categorised as using trained individuals if the
sample population was engaged in a structured training pro-
gramme and whose training plan was relevant for the exercise
task employed to study the effects of β-alanine; those indivi-
duals who did not fit this description (ie, recreationally active;
non-trained) were categorised as non-trained. Exercise tests
were additionally categorised according to whole-body or iso-
lated limb exercise (exercise mode), since differences in exercise
mode influence energy substrate usage33 and oxygen uptake
kinetics.34
Differences
in
whole-body and
isolated
muscle
recruitment have also been suggested to contribute to the effi-
cacy of β-alanine due to differences in whole body versus local
muscle acidosis.15 Exercise tests were similarly categorised
according to whether they employed an intermittent or continu-
ous exercise protocol (intermittent). Since increases in muscle
carnosine appear to be dose dependent,17 we analysed the effect
of total amount (total amount) and study length (study length)
as continuous variables (in grams and days). Further subanalysis
was performed on studies that investigated the effect of
co-supplementation of β-alanine and sodium bicarbonate on
exercise (co-supplementation).

To calculate the observed effect size variance, the correlation
between
presupplementation
and
postsupplementation
out-
comes (rpre�post) was required. A single correlation value was
estimated for all observed effect sizes. Raw data were obtained
for 9 of the 40 included studies, comprising a total of 12 out-
comes. The average presupplementation to postsupplementation
correlation value obtained was 0.877±0.20; a weighted average
presupplementation to postsupplementation correlation value of
0.95 (0.88 to 0.97) was obtained. Therefore, a single presupple-
mentation to postsupplementation correlation value of 0.9 was
used to calculate s2
r . Sensitivity analyses were also carried out
using a single presupplementation to postsupplementation cor-
relation value of 0.7.
A three-level mixed effects model was used to model effect
sizes and account for dependencies within the data. The basic
model consisted of three regression equations, one for each
level:36
djk ¼ bjk þ rjk with rjk � N(0; s2
rjkÞ
(level 1 : sample)
The equation at the first level states that djk, the j-th observed
effect size from study k, is equal to the corresponding popula-
tion value βjk plus a random deviation, rjk, that is normally dis-
tributed with mean zero and variance obtained as described
above. The second-level equation represents the outcome level
and states that the population effects for the different outcomes
within a study can be decomposed into a study mean (u0k) and
random residuals vjk.

The third level is an extension of the common random-effects
model and states that mean study effects u0kcan vary around an

 level model can provide appropriate mean effect size estimates
and SE estimates across a variety of realistic situations. The
model was then extended by incorporating fixed effects in an
attempt to further explain the variation in observed effect sizes.
The fixed effects assessed included characteristics of the out-
comes ((exercise duration), (exercise type), (training status),
(exercise mode)) and studies ((total amount), (study length)).
Subgroup analyses performed on outcomes from studies provid-
ing a co-supplementation group comprising β-alanine and
sodium
bicarbonate
were
performed
using
a
two-level
meta-analysis due to limited nesting of outcomes within studies.
Additionally,
effect
sizes
were
computed
comparing
the
co-supplementation group (BASB) relative
to
PL and
the
co-supplementation group relative to BA. All data were analysed
using the rma and rma.mv functions in the metafor package37
in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna Austria)
and significance level was previously set at p<0.05.
RESULTS
Included study characteristics
Forty published studies met the criteria for inclusion in the ana-
lyses (table 1). A total of 65 exercise tests were employed across
the various studies resulting in 70 exercise outcome measures in
1461 participants (BA: N=746; PL: N=715). Grouping of
studies and exercise protocols for the various subanalyses per-
formed is presented in table 2.
META-ANALYSIS
Overall
Results from the meta-analysis showed a small significant mean
effect size of 0.180 (95% CI 0.078 to 0.284). Substantial het-
erogeneity was noted with systematic variance (level 2 and level
3 variance) accounting for ∼72% of the total variance (table 3).
Sensitivity analysis using a presupplementation to postsupple-
mentation correlation of 0.7 resulted in a small main effect esti-
mate of 0.180 (95% CI 0.076 to 0.292) with a concomitant
increase in sampling variance that resulted in systematic variance
accounting for ∼36% of the total variance.
Univariate meta-regressions
There was a significant moderating effect of (duration 1)
(p=0.003) with results showing small significant effect sizes for
durations of 1–4 min (0.210 (95% CI 0.057 to 0.362)) and 4+
min (0.233 (95% CI 0.059 to 0.407)), but not 0–1 min (0.016
(95% CI −0.223 to 0.254)). Similarly, there was a significant
moderating effect of (duration 2) (p=0.004, figure 2) with
results showing a small significant effect size for durations of
0.5–10 min (0.224 (95% CI 0.088 to 0.361)). There was a ten-
dency towards significance for 10+ min (0.174 (95% CI
−0.030 to 0.377)) but effect size was not significant for 0–
0.5 min (0.040 (95% CI −0.220 to 0.300)).
There was no moderation effect distinguishing between the
different levels of (exercise type) (p=0.256), (training status)
(p=0.559),
(exercise
mode)
(p=0.931)
and
(intermittent)
(p=0.436). Similarly, no moderation effect was obtained for the
continuous variable (total amount) (p=0.438) on effect sizes.
However, there was a moderation effect of (study length)
(p=0.005) with an apparent 0.011 increase in effect size each
day beyond 20 days of supplementation (table 3). However, this
result appeared to be driven by the presence of two outliers
(Cook’s distance 1.8 and 0.7), and when a sensitivity analysis
was performed without these data points, (study length) no
longer had a significant effect (p=0.685).
Further analyses
Owing to the strong effect of (duration 2) on effect sizes,
further meta-regressions were performed using (duration 2).
Subgroup analyses were completed for the outcomes within
0.5–10 min (N=41) only. No moderation effects were shown
for (total amount) (p=0.831), (study length) (p=0.309) and
the different levels of (exercise mode) (p=0.507), (intermittent)
(p=0.255) or (training status) (p=0.874). However, there was a
significant moderation effect distinguishing between the two
levels of (exercise type) (p=0.01) with higher effect sizes for
exercise capacity than performance (0.4998, medium effect
(95% CI 0.246 to 0.753) vs 0.1078, small effect (95% CI
−0.201 to 0.416)).
Analysis of (co-supplementation) showed that, in comparison
to PL, BASB resulted in a significant effect size of 0.433 (0.230
to 0.637; p<0.001). Furthermore, compared with BA, BASB
also resulted in a significant effect size of 0.242 (0.071, 0.412;
p=0.006; figure 3).
DISCUSSION
The results of this meta-analysis showed a significant positive
overall effect of β-alanine supplementation on exercise, support-
ing the efficacy of increased muscle carnosine to improve exer-
cise. Exercise duration was the greatest influencing factor
regarding the efficacy of β-alanine supplementation. Replicating
the duration time frames of Hobson et al10 yielded similar
results; significant effect sizes were shown for exercise 1–4 min
in duration, supporting previous evidence that β-alanine is bene-
ficial for this exercise time frame. No effect was shown for exer-
cise protocols lasting <1 min, and considering a mechanism of
action relating to increased intracellular buffering, this would
make sense given that this duration of exercise is unlikely to be
limited by intracellular H+ accumulation.38 This finding also
provides some indirect evidence in opposition to the influence
of increased muscle carnosine content on calcium sensitivity of
the contractile apparatus or calcium release from the sarcoplas-
mic reticulum. This is in agreement with the recent data of
Hannah et al39 which showed no effect of β-alanine on
maximal
explosive
voluntary
contractions,
suggesting
that
calcium sensitivity and release might not be the primary
mechanisms by which increased carnosine improves whole
muscle exercise in humans. Exercise of longer than 4 min in
duration was improved with β-alanine supplementation, with
greater effect sizes than exercise 1–4 min in duration (0.233 vs
0.210), though we speculate that this may be due to shorter dur-
ation protocols (6–7 min),7 40 which may be more susceptible to
increases in muscle carnosine if its primary mechanism is con-
sidered to be that of pH buffering, being grouped with those of
longer duration (30–60 min).41 42
Although results reported within the current study agree
somewhat
with
the
categorisation
of
exercise
durations
employed by Hobson et al,10 we further explored the effect of
exercise duration using adapted criteria. Short duration exercise
(≤0.5 min) was not benefited from supplementation (d=0.040),
while effect sizes for moderate duration exercise (0.5–10 min)
were significant (d=0.224). However, β-alanine was no longer
shown to be effective for longer duration exercise (>10 min),
although there was still a moderate effect size (d=0.174). It was
supposed that these data may have been influenced by incremen-
tal protocols with a low intensity during the initial stages that
were unlikely to induce fatigue. Therefore, the duration of such
tests is somewhat deceptive since it is only the latter stages, con-
ducted at higher exercise intensities, that may be susceptible to

 changes in muscle carnosine content. Although individual
studies appear to confirm this hypothesis, there were no differ-
ences in effect sizes between continuous and incremental proto-
cols (data not shown). Nonetheless, we provide novel evidence
here to suggest that exercise of 0.5–10 min in duration to be the
exercise time frame in which β-alanine supplementation is most
influential.
Exercise capacity and performance were both improved by
supplementation, although effect sizes suggested β-alanine to be
almost twice as effective at improving exercise capacity. Further
meta-regressions were performed on outcomes within 0.5–
10 min due to the strong effect of duration on effect sizes, and
showed higher effect sizes for exercise capacity than perform-
ance indicating that exercise capacity tests within this time
frame will most likely elicit the greatest improvements with
β-alanine supplementation. It has previously been suggested that
performance tests, such as time trials, may be influenced by
intrinsic pacing,32 potentially making them less likely to be
influenced by increased muscle carnosine concentration. The
majority of capacity tests included in the analyses were per-
formed until exhaustion, most likely resulting in a maximal pro-
duction of H+, and thus are sensitive to changes in buffering
capacity. As such, current data suggest that exercise capacity
tests provide greater scope to identify significant effects of
β-alanine supplementation, particularly within a 0.5–10 min
time frame.
There has been doubt raised as to the efficacy of β-alanine in
well-trained participants,13
14 perhaps due to adaptions to
training such as increased buffering capacity, which may minim-
ise the contribution of increased muscle carnosine content in
these individuals. The findings of this study showed significant
effect sizes for non-trained individuals only, suggesting that they
may be more susceptible to exercise improvements than their
well-trained counterparts. This appears in contrast to de Salles
Painelli et al,43 who directly compared the efficacy of β-alanine
supplementation on training status using a trained and non-
trained population and showed it to be equally effective in both
sets of participants. Nonetheless, there were no differences in
effect sizes between trained and non-trained populations in this
study, while effect sizes for the trained group were close to the
overall effect of β-alanine (0.144 vs 0.180). Although it appears
that trained athletes might experience smaller gains, such
changes may translate into worthwhile improvements in an
applied setting (ie, competition). Thus, this meta-analysis pro-
vides some evidence to support the efficacy of β-alanine in non-
trained and trained populations, though improvements are likely
to be greater in non-trained individuals.
The efficacy of β-alanine may be influenced by the mode of
exercise performed, specifically whole-body versus isolated limb
activity. Smaller muscle groups, such as upper-body muscles,
may be more subjected to local acidosis than whole body exer-
cise.44 In addition, increased muscle tension imposed by the
type of muscle contraction can mechanically reduce peripheral
blood flow and oxygen extraction,45 which may lead to an
increased muscle acidosis. Therefore, it has been suggested that
differences in muscle recruitment between activities such as

 cycling and running may lead to discrepancies in the apparent
efficacy of the supplement.15 The current data suggest, however,
that the efficacy of β-alanine is not affected by the mode of exer-
cise and that both isolated limb and whole-body exercise are
equally likely to benefit. Indeed, individual studies do provide
evidence that whole-body type tasks can be improved by
β-alanine supplementation.40 46 47 Nonetheless, well-controlled
experiments specifically designed to address whether there is a
greater effect of local versus whole body acidosis are warranted.
Additionally, intermittent and continuous protocols were both
equally improved with β-alanine. However, most intermittent
tests were not sport-specific protocols, and thus further research
investigating the effect of β-alanine within applied sport-specific
settings is warranted.
Neither the total amount ingested nor the supplementation
duration mediated the effect of β-alanine supplementation on
exercise outcomes. These results may be due to the wide range
of dosing strategies employed, meaning that individuals per-
formed exercise at various stages of increased muscle carnosine
content. Although Stellingwerff et al17 showed that increases in
muscle carnosine concentration were dependent on the total
amount of β-alanine consumed, their study employed two low
doses (1.6 and 3.2 g/day), whereas most studies included in this
meta-analysis employed higher doses. The time course of carno-
sine accumulation with doses in excess of 3.2 g/day is yet to be
determined and, given that most studies did not directly
measure muscle carnosine content, it is not possible to deter-
mine whether individuals performed exercise following similar
increases
in
muscle
carnosine,
although
this
would
seem
unlikely. This meta-analysis showed that the total amount of
β-alanine ingested does not directly influence its efficacy, making
it difficult to make specific recommendations as to the optimal
dosing strategy for individuals. Nonetheless, supplementation of
1.6 g/day for as little as 2 weeks has been shown to increase
muscle carnosine,17 while improvements in exercise have been
shown at doses ranging from 3.2–6.4 g/day for 4–12 weeks.4 26
Further research should determine the required dosing strategy
to
attain
maximal
carnosine accumulation in
muscle and
whether maximal exercise improvements occur at an identical
time point.
It has been suggested that co-supplementation of β-alanine
with sodium bicarbonate may result in further exercise gains over
β-alanine alone, due to an increase in intracellular and extracellu-
lar buffering capacity. Six of the nine studies encountered in our
search strategy investigating co-supplementation were included in
the analysis. The majority of studies that employed acute doses of
sodium bicarbonate have shown co-supplementation to result in
non-significant effects on performance.13 18 47 The only study
that employed a chronic (7 days) sodium bicarbonate supplemen-
tation phase showed a significant effect of the additional sodium
bicarbonate
supplementation
with
β-alanine
over
β-alanine
alone.48 This may be due to the multiple-bout nature of the test,
which most likely resulted in a higher acidosis than the continu-
ous exercise protocols employed in other studies;30 49 or due to
the chronic supplementation protocol employed, which may
have resulted in a more pronounced blood alkalosis,50 although
the authors did not measure this directly. Nonetheless, the
current meta-analytic data suggest that co-supplementation of
β-alanine with sodium bicarbonate can lead to additional gains
over those with β-alanine alone. The reason for the apparent dis-
parity between our findings and the individual study results may
be due to the statistical power of the studies undertaken. Studies
investigating the effects of combined supplementation have used
relatively small sample sizes, which may have hindered standard

Taken
together,
these
data
suggest
that
the
co-supplementation of β-alanine with sodium bicarbonate results
in further benefits than supplementation with β-alanine alone.
Nonetheless, further investigation is required since the current
data are based on the results of six individual studies only.
This study is not without its limitations. All outcome mea-
sures were converted to effect sizes to standardise the data and
subsequently perform our meta-analyses. It has previously been
suggested that converting data to mean power may be more
appropriate so that meta-analysed performance effects could be
applied directly to athletic performance and practical recom-
mendations for coaches and athletes.52 However, the sheer
variety of exercise protocols included in this analysis meant that
it was not possible to convert all available data into power
output. Furthermore, we feel that our analytical approach pro-
vides a comprehensive and clear analysis of the data, clarifying
its significance to different athletic populations. Although our
choice of subanalyses and categorisation of exercise
tests
revealed insightful information on the ergogenic properties of
β-alanine supplementation, we acknowledge that alternative sub-
analyses could have been performed and that our definitions to
categorise studies into these subanalyses may differ from other
authors. However, we believe our choices to be relevant from a
practical standpoint (ie, in a sport context) and we have
attempted to support this with an evidence base.
In conclusion, β-alanine supplementation had a significant
overall ergogenic effect on exercise. Exercise duration was the
greatest influencing factor on the efficacy of β-alanine supple-
mentation, with a time frame of 0.5–10 min likely to result in
the greatest gains, while very short duration exercise clearly
results in no benefits. Exercise capacity resulted in greater effect
sizes than exercise performance; this was particularly apparent
for exercise lasting 0.5–10 min. The efficacy of β-alanine for
non-trained individuals was clearly demonstrated, while lower
effect sizes were shown for trained populations, though these
may still translate into competitive gains. Isolated limb versus
whole body exercise benefited equally from β-alanine supple-
mentation. The co-supplementation of β-alanine and sodium
bicarbonate resulted in the largest effect sizes and also resulted
in greater gains than β-alanine alone.
From a practical standpoint, these data allow individuals to
make informed decisions as to the likelihood of an ergogenic
effect with β-alanine supplementation based on their chosen
exercise modality (eg, 400, 800 and 1500 m running; 4 km
cycling; 100, 200 and 400 m swimming) and coaches can
support claims as to the efficacy of this supplement to their ath-
letes. Athletic individuals can also save time and resources if
they are unlikely to obtain any exercise gains due to their pre-
ferred sport (eg, 100 m running; 25 m swimming), although
improvements with supplementation during training should not
be dismissed since this will most likely incorporate repeated
exercise bouts and activity of longer duration than competition.
Individuals are advised to supplement daily with β-alanine for a
minimum of 2–4 weeks at a dose of 3.2–6.4 g/day ingested at
several time points throughout the day (0.8–1.6 g every 3–
4 hour) to avoid acute side effects. Although the current data
support the efficacy of β-alanine supplementation during certain
types of exercise, the exact mechanisms by which increased car-
nosine contributes to improved exercise outcomes remains to be
experimentally demonstrated. Further studies should aim to
determine the exact contribution of carnosine to buffering
capacity and the changes therein following dietary supplementa-
tion of β-alanine. Additionally, it would be of interest to deter-
mine the greatest exercise gains due to increased muscle
carnosine concentration using more prolonged supplementation
protocols, and whether gains directly mirror changes in intracel-
lular carnosine. The current meta-analysis provides support to
design the most appropriate protocols to determine changes in
muscle carnosine concentration with β-alanine (ie, exercise cap-
acity test of 0.5–10 min).
Key points
▸ Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is abundant in skeletal
muscle, suggesting that it plays an important role during
exercise, with a key physiological role considered to be
intracellular pH regulation.
▸ β-alanine supplementation can increase muscle carnosine
concentration and improve exercise capacity and
performance.
▸ There may be a number of confounding factors, including
exercise type, duration and mode and population, which
may influence the effects of β-alanine supplementation.
These are the novel findings from the study
▸ There was an overall ergogenic effect of β-alanine
supplementation on exercise.
▸ Exercise duration was the greatest factor influencing effect
sizes: a duration of 0.5–10 min results in the greatest gains
while very short duration exercise (<0.5 min) clearly results
in no benefits.
▸ Effect sizes for exercise capacity were larger than for
performance, particularly during exercise lasting from 0.5 to
10 min in duration.
▸ The effect of β-alanine on trained individuals showed
smaller effect sizes than on non-trained individuals, while
isolated limb and whole body exercise were shown to
equally benefit from β-alanine.
▸ Co-supplementation of β-alanine and sodium bicarbonate, to
increase both intracellular and extracellular buffering
capacity, was shown to result in additional improvements
above β-alanine alone.
