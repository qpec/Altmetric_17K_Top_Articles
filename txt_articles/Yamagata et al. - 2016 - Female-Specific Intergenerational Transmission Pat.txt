corticolimbic circuit, including the amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex between
biological mothers and daughters. This association was significantly greater than mother–son, father–daughter, and father–son associ-
ations. The current study suggests that the corticolimbic circuitry, which has been implicated in mood regulation, shows a matrilineal-

Introduction
Parents have large genetic and environmental influences on off-
spring’s cognition, behavior, and brain (Curley and Mashoodh,
2010; Cabrera et al., 2011; Curley, 2011). Furthermore, intergen-
erational trait transmission is often observed in the psychopa-
thology of major psychiatric conditions, such as mood disorders

 (Curley and Mashoodh, 2010; Guilmatre and Sharp, 2012). For
example, offspring of depressed parents are two to three times
more likely than the offspring of nondepressed controls to exhibit
elevated levels of depression (Weissman et al., 2006). If so, the
neurocircuitry involved in depression may also show intergen-
erational transmission effects. A large body of human neuroim-
aging studies indicate that corticolimbic circuitry, which includes
the amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),
and ventromedial prefrontal cortex [vmPFC–orbitofrontal cor-
tex (OFC) and gyrus rectus], is central in mood disorders (Price
and Drevets, 2010). Growing animal and human neuroimaging
literature has similarly implicated this corticolimbic circuitry as
the biological substrate of emotion regulation (Banks et al.,
2007). This points to corticolimbic circuitry as an important tar-
get for investigating depression and its intergenerational effects.
In depression, a maternal transmission pattern is observed,
where maternal depression is associated with numerous adverse
outcomes among offspring (Downey and Coyne, 1990; Beardslee
et al., 1998), particularly between depression amongst mothers
and adolescent daughters (Davies and Windle, 1997; Goodman
and Gotlib, 1999; Goodman, 2007; Thompson et al., 2014). More
specifically, maternal depressive symptoms are correlated with
that of daughters (r � 0.44) but not sons (r � �0.01; Fergusson
et al., 1995), as well as maternal depressive/anxiety disorder cor-
relating with daughters’ but not sons’ internalizing symptoms
(Piche et al., 2011). Accordingly, we would expect that there is a
female-specific neurobiological transmission pattern in the cor-
ticolimbic circuitry. Additionally, in the animal literature, mater-
nal gestational stress significantly decreased the number of
hippocampal neurons as a result of increases in calcium content
and oxidant generation in the hippocampal CA3 region in female
offspring but not in male offspring. Females may have a higher
generation of oxidants because of higher corticosterone caused
by prenatal stress (Zhu et al., 2004). Moreover, the hypothala-
mus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis responses to gestational stress
are different between male and female offspring. Basal and stress-
induced increases in corticosterone levels are found only in pre-
natally stressed female offspring (Weinstock M et al., 1992;
Szuran et al., 2000). Such female-dominant HPA axis activ-
ity may be caused by a greater transport of corticosterone from
maternal blood across the placenta of female fetuses than of
male fetuses (Montano et al., 1993). These animal studies have
revealed the underlying neurobiological underpinnings of
female-specific intergenerational effects. However, to date, there
have been no neuroimaging studies that examined the neural
evidence of intergenerational transmission patterns in humans.
Studies such as these can contribute unique information that can
bridge animal research and human clinical studies that is differ-
ent from the more common approach, i.e., to examine heritabil-
ity in twins, in which sex-specific intergenerational transmission
patterns cannot be assessed (Alemany et al., 2013).
The purpose of the current study was to examine female-
specific intergenerational transmission patterns on brain struc-
ture in parent–offspring pairs in healthy individuals. We
hypothesized that mother–daughter pairs would reveal signifi-
cantly positive gray matter volume (GMV) associations in the
corticolimbic brain regions (implicated in mood disorders) com-
pared with other parent–offspring pairs. Our hypothesis was
based on findings from previous studies demonstrating that de-
pression exhibits strong female-specific intergenerational trans-
mission patterns indicated above (Fergusson et al., 1995;
Goodman and Gotlib, 1999; Goodman, 2007; Piche et al., 2011).
Therefore, we focused on corticolimbic circuitry, including the
amygdala, hippocampus, ACC, and vmPFC GMV, and analyzed
the degree of association between mothers and daughters com-
pared with mothers and sons, fathers and sons, and fathers and
daughters, in these brain regions.
Materials and Methods
Participants. A total of 35 healthy families, consisting of parents aged
33–48 years and their biological offspring aged 5–13 years, were included
for the present study from a larger study that was not focused on the
corticolimbic system and related behavior. Participants were recruited
from local newspapers, school mailings, flyers, and mother’s clubs. Ex-
clusion criteria for this study were the presence of neurological or psy-
chiatric disorders, including substance abuse, the use of medication,
and/or contraindication to MRI (e.g., metal in the subject’s body), in
either parent or offspring reported by the parents. However, it is still
possible that mothers omitted reporting past or current use of steroids,
including contraceptives, that may affect brain morphometry (Pletzer et
al., 2010), because these are commonly taken among healthy people. The
Stanford University and University of California San Francisco Panel on
Human Subjects in Medical Research approved the study. After complete
description of the study to the participants, written informed consent
and assent were obtained from parents and children, respectively. Thirty-
one families had one child and four families had two children. We created
four parent–offspring subgroups, including 16 mother–daughter, 18
mother–son, 15 father–daughter, and 18 father–son pairs.
Demographic, cognitive, and behavioral assessments. Behavioral data
(such as mental health status) of offspring were obtained by the Behav-
ioral Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2; Reyn-
olds and Kamphaus, 2004), which is a multimethod, multidimensional
system used to evaluate the adaptive and problematic behavior of chil-
dren and young adults aged 2–25 years. We collected parent-rating scales
(PRS) of nine clinical scales, including aggression, anxiety, attention
problems, atypicality, conduct problems, depression, hyperactivity, so-
matization, and withdrawal, and five adaptive scales, including activities
of daily living, adaptability, functional communication, leadership, and
social skills. The BASC-2 was normed in the United States using a large
representative sample of youth (including �13,000 cases) from across
the nation. Aged-normed T scores are continuously distributed within
the population, with a mean of 50 and an SD of 10. A high score implies
more emotional and behavioral problems, except for the adaptive skills
scale for which a high score implies more attributes that contribute to
healthy functioning. More specifically, on the clinical scales, T scores
from 60 to 69 indicate “at-risk” behaviors and 70 and above indicate
“clinically significant” concerns. Conversely, analogous cutoffs are estab-
lished for the adaptive skills scale whereby T scores from 31 to 40 are
considered to be at-risk and 30 or less are considered to be clinically
significant.
To evaluate potential sex differences in age in our samples, we used
independent Student’s t tests for age in parents and offspring, respec-
tively. Because the BASC-2 PRS consists of 14 subscales, we performed a
multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) to compare group dif-
ferences between male and female offspring using these BASC-2 PRS
subscales as dependent variables. Then, if a main effect of group on the
MANCOVA was confirmed, a post hoc ANCOVA was performed. Al-
though there were no significant differences in age, age was included as

 covariate in the analyses because of the relatively wide range in age of the
children (age range, 5–13 years). Because all data were originally col-
lected for the purpose of a study examining the neural bases of academic
achievement in the offspring, there were no relevant behavioral data in
parents (except for measures such as IQ).
Image acquisition and preprocessing. MR images were acquired using a 3
T whole-body GE-Signa HDxt scanner (GE Healthcare) with a quadrature
head coil at the Lucas Center for Imaging at Stanford University. For voxel-
based morphometry (VBM), high-resolution T1 anatomical scans were ob-
tainedusingafastspoiledgradientrecalledechopulsesequence(160coronal
slices;TR,8.5ms;TE,1.7ms;inversiontime,300ms;flipangle,15°;number
of excitations, 1; FOV, 22 cm; matrix, 256 � 256; thickness, 1.2 mm; acqui-
sition time, 4 min 34 s). Images were first checked visually for scanner arti-
facts and anatomical anomalies. Preprocessing was done using DARTEL
(Ashburner, 2007) for VBM in SPM8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm).
We further selected the modulated normalized nonlinear-only option,

Parent–offspring correlation in corticolimbic circuitry. First, we per-
formed voxelwise correlation analysis of volumes between mother and
daughter, controlling for daughter’s age and limiting the analysis to the re-
gionofinterest(ROI)usingtheBPM(BiologicalParametricMapping)tool-
box (Casanova et al., 2007). We created one corticolimbic ROI, including
bilateral amygdala, ACC, vmPFC including the OFC and gyrus rectus, hip-
pocampus, and parahippocampus gyrus defined by Automated Talairach
Atlas Label (Lancaster et al., 2000) in the Wake Forest University PickAtlas
toolbox (http://fmri.wfubmc.edu/cms/software#PickAtlas). ROI analyses
were performed using a statistical threshold of p � 0.05 for voxel height,
which then was thresholded at a cluster threshold of p � 0.05 for familywise
error(FWE).ThisresultedinabrainmapshowingsignificantpositiveGMV
correlations between mother and daughter.
Second, because our primary goal was to examine the specificity of the
parent–offspring GMV relationship, the next steps were to create brain
maps that compared correlation coefficients (r) between different par-
ent–offspring groups on a voxelwise basis in the corticolimbic ROI.
Based on our a priori hypothesis, we generated three brain maps: (1)
correlation coefficients (association) that were significantly stronger be-
tween mother–daughter compared with mother–son pairs to examine
whether mothers show stronger effects on daughters than sons; (2) mot-
her–daughter greater than father–daughter association to examine
whether mothers compared with fathers show stronger effects on daugh-
ters; and (3) mother–daughter greater than father–son association to
show, to the extent possible, sex-specific effects. One challenge in testing
for statistical differences between correlations in our data is the partial
dependency of the sample. For example, when we compare mother–
daughter correlation with mother–son correlation, some observations
are dependent (e.g., a mother who has a daughter and a son), but some
others are not (e.g., a mother who has a daughter only). To address this
statistical issue, we used a bootstrapping method (Efron and Tibshirani,
1993) to assess the significance of the difference between the two corre-
lation coefficients. Specifically, we derived the SEs of the differences in
correlations (e.g., SE of the differences in mother–daughter correlation
and mother–son correlation) by repeatedly resampling the observed
data. Importantly, the resampling procedure takes into account the (par-
tial) dependency of the data, making it possible to precisely compute the
SEs. Before implementing bootstrapping, each individual’s processed
voxelwise GMV values within the corticolimbic ROI were extracted and
converted to matrices using an in-house MATLAB-based multivariate
pattern analysis toolbox (Hoeft et al., 2008, 2011). We then ran boot-
strapping with an in-house R code (R Core Team, 2015). As a result, we
obtained three brain maps representing significantly greater positive
GMV correlation in mother–daughter pairs (p � 0.05) compared with
mother–son, father–daughter, and father–son pairs, respectively. Fi-
nally, we overlapped these three brain maps and the FWE-corrected
mother–daughter correlation map to identify the voxels that showed
significantly greater positive correlations between mother–daughter
pairs than for the other three pairings.
Correlation between regional brain volume and behavioral data. To ex-
amine whether the degree of GMV in brain regions that show significant
positive association between mothers and daughters is associated with
emotional and behavioral functioning in daughters, Pearson’s correlation
analyses were performed between GMV data and standardized scores from
allBASC-2scalesobtainedfromthedaughters.Basedonpreviousbehavioral

andWindle,1997;GoodmanandGotlib,1999;Goodman,2007;Thompson

from clusters in the amygdala, ACC, OFC, gyrus rectus, and hippocampus
thatshowedsignificantpositiveassociationsbetweenmothersanddaughters
compared with other parent–offspring dyads within the corticolimbic ROI.
All behavioral data were originally collected for the purpose of a different
study, and hence we only had data from 10 of 16 daughters, making these
results tentative and exploratory at best.

inent on the left) and bilateral OFC (more prominent on the right),
and the right hippocampus and the bilateral parahippocampus
gyrus (Fig. 1, Table 2). We also overlapped these brain maps to

There was a positive correlation between GMV of the gyrus rectus
and adaptability T scores (r � 0.710, p � 0.021 uncorrected);
however, these results did not reach statistical significance when
applying Bonferroni’s correction. There was no significant corre-
lation between GMV of the other brain regions and any behav-
ioral measures despite other subscales showing similar or even
greater variance (all p values �0.1 corrected).
Discussion
The present study found female-specific intergenerational effects
on brain structure between biological parent–offspring dyads.
Specifically, consistent with our hypothesis, positive associations
of regional GMV between mothers and daughters were signifi-
cantly greater than mother–son, father–daughter, and father–
son associations in the amygdala, hippocampus, ACC, and
vmPFC, which included the gyrus rectus and OFC. These find-
ings may indicate that the daughter’s corticolimbic circuitry is
associated specifically with that of the mother’s. A growing num-
ber of animal and human neuroimaging studies have implicated
corticolimbic circuitry, specifically the amygdala, ACC, and
vmPFC, as the biological substrates of emotion regulation. The
amygdala regulates a variety of emotions, including depression,
anxiety, and fear, and plays a major role in emotional memory
processing and reactivity of the HPA axis to stress (Banks et al.,
2007). The ventral ACC, in particular the pregenual and sub-
genual ACC, has functional connections with OFC, amygdala,
and hippocampus and participates generally in emotion regula-
tion (Drevets et al., 2008; Pizzagalli, 2011). The vmPFC, via its
direct structural and functional connections with the amygdala
(Ghashghaei et al., 2007), modulates emotional responses
through GABAergic inhibitory projections (Akirav et al., 2006).
Dysfunction in this circuitry is associated strongly with condi-
tions such as mood and anxiety disorders (Price and Drevets,
2010). In addition, the finding in the hippocampus further sup-
ports our hypothesis. The hippocampus is one of the key compo-
nents of emotional regulatory networks in the brain. Previous

Yamagata et al. • Intergenerational Effects in the Human Brain
J. Neurosci., January 27, 2016 • 36(4):1254–1260 • 1257
 studies have reported that depression is associated with smaller
hippocampal volume because of glucocorticoid neurotoxicity
and stress-induced reduction in neurotrophic factors and neuro-
genesis (Sheline, 2011).
In this study, we show the intriguing finding that mother’s and
daughter’s corticolimbic morphology was more similar than
other parent–offspring pairs. Our study provides novel neurobi-
ological support for female-specific transmission patterns in de-
pression. Several previous studies have revealed that healthy
controls with a family history of depression (high-risk group)
compared with those with no family history of any psychiatric
disease (low-risk group) had structural abnormalities in cortico-
limbic circuitry, including smaller hippocampus, smaller ACC,
and larger amygdala volumes. They suggested that these struc-
tural anomalies may be potential neurobiological markers of vul-
nerability for depression (Boes et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2010;
Romanczuk-Seiferth et al., 2014). Moreover, other data suggest
that the combination of early-life adversity and smaller hip-
pocampal size significantly increases the vulnerability for depres-
sion (Rao et al., 2010). Together, our findings indicate that, if
mothers have brain structural anomalies in the corticolimbic cir-
cuitry, their female but not male offspring are more likely to have
similar abnormal structural patterns in the same brain regions.
Although additional research is warranted, these matrilineal
associations may be tightly linked to greater vulnerability for
daughters but not sons in developing depression when their
mothers have depression.
It is currently difficult to point to the precise underlying
mechanisms of our findings because of lack of previous studies.
Nonetheless, one may speculate that genetic, prenatal, and post-
natal environmental factors and their interactions may underlie
female-specific intergenerational patterns in depression symp-
toms, brain morphometry, and gene expression patterns in the
corticolimbic circuitry. In addition to animal studies mentioned
in the Introduction, gestational stress leads to increased cortico-
tropin releasing hormone mRNA in the amygdala (Cratty et al.,
1995), and the amount of maternal care influences epigenetic
modification (methylation) to hypothalamic estrogen receptor �
in female rats (Champagne et al., 2006). These studies provide the
underlying neurobiological evidence of female-specific intergen-
erational effects by examining gene expression in brain tissue.
Furthermore, female but not male offspring of mice show a re-
duction in hippocampal glial count in the pyramidal layer after
prenatal stress (Behan et al., 2011). In humans, one multisite
survey in both genetically related and unrelated parent–offspring
pairs reported that girls may be more prone to the negative influ-
ences of maternal depression symptoms than boys through envi-
ronmental processes (Lewis et al., 2011). A previous study
revealed that higher maternal prenatal cortisol level and off-
spring’s depression problems were associated with larger right
amygdala volumes in girls but not boys (Buss et al., 2012). These
findings indicate the presence of female-specific placental adap-
tation to stress exposure (Clifton, 2010), which may influence
more similar neurodevelopmental trajectory among females
compared with males in the corticolimbic circuitry. Longitudinal
studies in families with different genetic, prenatal, and postnatal
environmental influences are needed to examine the relationship
between maternal stress, endocrine effects, and brain develop-
ment in mothers and their daughters.
Furthermore, in the gyrus rectus, which is the medial part of
the OFC, a positive correlation between GMV of daughters and
their adaptability in the BASC-2 was found, such that larger vol-
umes of the OFC may be related to higher levels of adaptability.
This finding may support previous animal studies indicating that
the OFC contributes to emotional and social adaptive behavior
(Roberts, 2006). Behavioral measures in the current study were
collected for the broader purpose of another study and were not
optimized to examine intergenerational effects; hence, together
with the small sample and lack of measures in parents, the results
of this exploratory analysis should be interpreted with caution.
There has been increasing consensus on sex differences in gray
matter developmental trajectories (Giedd et al., 1999; De Bellis et
al., 2001). Cerebral volume and GMV in the frontal and parietal
lobes peak earlier in girls than in boys (Lenroot and Giedd, 2006).
Moreover, sex differences have been demonstrated in the hip-
pocampus (larger in females), amygdala (larger in males), and
thalamus (larger in males; Koolschijn and Crone, 2013); how-
ever, our study found that mother–daughter pairs consistently
demonstrated significantly greater positive GMV correlations
compared with the other parent–offspring pairs not only in the
amygdala and medial PFC in which volume is larger in males than
in females but also in the OFC and hippocampus in which vol-
ume is larger in females than in males (Cosgrove et al., 2007;
Koolschijn and Crone, 2013). These results indicate that sex dif-
ference in these brain volumes cannot account for the pattern of
associations we observed. Additional research is needed to exam-
ine the mechanisms underlying the consistent female-specific as-
sociation patterns in each brain region showing a pronounced
sexual dimorphism in development within the corticolimbic
circuitry.
Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, be-
cause we only used genetically related families, in which genetic,
prenatal, and postnatal environments are shared and did not
include in vitro fertilization (IVF) and adoptive families, we were

Yamagata et al. • Intergenerational Effects in the Human Brain
 unable to dissociate the influence of these three factors on our
neurobiological findings of intergenerational effects. Second, we
did not directly examine how functional and anatomical connec-
tivities within corticolimbic circuitry are mediated by the inter-
generational effects in this sample. Therefore, additional studies
using multimodal imaging in three different groups (genetic,
IVF, and adoptive groups) are needed. Third, we only focused on
matrilineal transmission patterns in the human brain based on
our hypothesis; however, Rodgers et al. (2013, 2015) found that
stressed male mice show an increase in micro-RNAs in their
sperm, leading to reduced HPA stress axis responsivity in adult
offspring. The result indicates novel epigenetic mechanisms of
paternal transmission patterns in neuropsychiatric disorders in-
cluding depression. Thus, it is also important to examine paternal
intergenerational transmission effects in the corticolimbic cir-
cuitry in future studies. Fourth, the human amygdala appears to
undergo rapid development early in life (Tottenham et al., 2009).
Amygdala structural growth is complete by 4 years old (Giedd et
al., 1996), and functional development reaches its peak during
adolescence (Hare et al., 2008). Conversely, in rodent models, the
vmPFC develops late in life (Van Eden and Uylings, 1985) and
connectivity between the amygdala and the vmPFC does not
emerge until adolescence (Cunningham et al., 2002). Therefore,
longitudinal studies are required to explore how our findings of
female-specific intergenerational patterns are affected by the de-
velopmental trajectory in the corticolimbic circuitry. In the cur-
rent study, although cross-sectional, we attempted to capture
children with minimal influence of puberty and extra-family en-
vironment on the brain (Dahl, 2004). Finally, because of the rel-
atively small sample size and exploratory nature of our analysis,
the current findings are preliminary and require additional re-
search with a larger sample. However, the current study repre-
sents the first study to examine parental transmission patterns of
corticolimbic morphometry in humans in vivo.
In summary, to our knowledge, this is the first study to inves-
tigate intergenerational transmission patterns in the human
brain using neuroimaging. We demonstrate a significant matri-
lineal association between parents and their offspring in a brain
circuit associated with emotion regulation as measured by re-
gional GMV. Our results provide new insights into the potential
neuroanatomical basis of female-specific intergenerational ef-
fects of psychiatric conditions, especially in depression. Findings
from our study have the potential to bridge animal work and
clinical observations. Ultimately, findings such as ours may have
important implications for furthering the understanding and the
creation of developmental stage-specific and circuit-based treat-
ment intervention of mental illnesses, such as depression, that
show intergenerational effects.
