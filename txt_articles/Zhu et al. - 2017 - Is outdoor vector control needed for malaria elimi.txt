Abstract 
Background: Residual malaria transmission has been reported in many areas even with adequate indoor vector 
control coverage, such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). The increased insecticide resistance in Anopheles 
mosquitoes has resulted in reduced efficacy of the widely used indoor tools and has been linked with an increase in 
outdoor malaria transmission. There are considerations of incorporating outdoor interventions into integrated vector 
management (IVM) to achieve malaria elimination; however, more information on the combination of tools for effec-
tive control is needed to determine their utilization.
Methods: A spatial individual-based model was modified to simulate the environment and malaria transmission 
activities in a hypothetical, isolated African village setting. LLINs and outdoor attractive toxic sugar bait (ATSB) stations 
were used as examples of indoor and outdoor interventions, respectively. Different interventions and lengths of effi-
cacy periods were tested. Simulations continued for 420 days, and each simulation scenario was repeated 50 times. 
Mosquito populations, entomologic inoculation rates (EIRs), probabilities of local mosquito extinction, and propor-
tion of time when the annual EIR was reduced below one were compared between different intervention types and 
efficacy periods.
Results: In the village setting with clustered houses, the combinational intervention of 50% LLINs plus outdoor 
ATSBs significantly reduced mosquito population and EIR in short term, increased the probability of local mosquito 
extinction, and increased the time when annual EIR is less than one per person compared to 50% LLINs alone; 
outdoor ATSBs alone significantly reduced mosquito population in short term, increased the probability of mosquito 
extinction, and increased the time when annual EIR is less than one compared to 50% LLINs alone, but there was no 
significant difference in EIR in short term between 50% LLINs and outdoor ATSBs. In the village setting with dispersed 
houses, the combinational intervention of 50% LLINs plus outdoor ATSBs significantly reduced mosquito popula-
tion in short term, increased the probability of mosquito extinction, and increased the time when annual EIR is less 
than one per person compared to 50% LLINs alone; outdoor ATSBs alone significantly reduced mosquito population 
in short term, but there were no significant difference in the probability of mosquito extinction and the time when 
annual EIR is less than one between 50% LLIN and outdoor ATSBs; and there was no significant difference in EIR 
between all three interventions. A minimum of 2 months of efficacy period is needed to bring out the best possible 
effect of the vector control tools, and to achieve long-term mosquito reduction, a minimum of 3 months of efficacy 
period is needed.

Background
Huge progress has been made toward malaria elimina-
tion following the scale up of long-lasting insecticidal 
nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) [1–5], 
the two major vector control tools recommended by 
the World Health Organization (WHO). However, out-
door residual malaria transmission has been consistently 
reported in many areas where these interventions are in 
place [6, 7]. The wide use of LLINs and IRS has resulted 
in increased insecticide resistance in the malaria vector 
mosquitoes both chemically [8–10] and behaviourally [7, 
11–17], reducing the efficacy of these tools and increas-
ing outdoor malaria transmission [18]. Studies have sug-
gested that indoor interventions alone are not sufficient 
to achieve malaria elimination, especially in places with 
high malaria transmission [7, 11, 19, 20]. Hence, it is of 
interest to evaluate the necessity of using outdoor vector 
control tools to complement the indoor control by LLINs 
and IRS to achieve malaria elimination.
A major benefit of outdoor vector control is that it can 
target and kill mosquitoes in their natural outdoor habi-
tats and is not limited only to the vicinity of residential 
houses. In addition, it can target the vectors displaying 
more outdoor human biting activity in response to the 
indoor interventions [7, 11, 12, 18, 21]. There are several 
outdoor adult mosquito control methods, such as ther-
mal fogging [22, 23], insecticide-treated cattle [24–26], 
male swarm spraying [27], “push–pull system” (indoor 
spatial repellent and outdoor traps) [28, 29], and mos-
quito landing box [30, 31]. There are also outdoor larval 
source management tools which are recommended by the 
WHO as supplementary malaria vector control methods 
[32, 33], but the feasibility is limited because of the large 
number of small and temporary larval habitats of malaria 
vectors [34]. One of the most promising new tools for 
outdoor vector control is attractive toxic sugar baits 
(ATSBs) [35, 36], which target the sugar-feeding behav-
iour of mosquitoes [37] and can be used outdoors either 
sprayed on vegetation or as bait stations. Several field tri-
als have demonstrated the efficacy of both outdoor and 
indoor ATSBs against malaria vector mosquitoes [35, 
36, 38–40]. An individual-based modelling (IBM) study 
has estimated and compared the effectiveness of differ-
ent spatial configurations of ATSB treatment on malaria 
control [41]. In addition, insecticide resistance will not 
affect the efficacy of this tool because there are already 
plenty of oral toxins available from different chemical 
groups and having different modes of actions, which can 
be used/exchanged in ATSBs [38].
Both LLINs and ATSBs have limited efficacy periods. 
Studies in multiple locations have reported that LLINs 
were not fully used because of discarding [42, 43], giv-
ing away [42], or using for purposes other than indoor 
vector control [42]. In addition, the efficacy period of 
LLIN products varies, and they gradually lose efficacy 
due to reduced insecticidal activity, holes, damage, and 
improper use [42–46]. Similar for ATSBs, baits sprayed 
on vegetation may be washed out by rain, and although 
bait stations can resist rains, they may lose efficacy due 
to damage or expiration. Hence, predicting the recovery 
pattern of vector populations and malaria transmission 
after the efficacy period of these interventions can pro-
vide information on the durability of the interventions 
to guide the tool replacement schedule and further cost-
effectiveness evaluations.
Integrated vector management (IVM) is important to 
extend the malaria elimination process. IVM suggests evi-
dence-based decision-making and integrated approaches 
[47]. Considering the option of outdoor vector control, a 
basic question pertinent to developing IVM programmes 
is the optimal combination of indoor and outdoor inter-
ventions that are required to achieve desired reductions in 
malaria transmission given financial, technical, and logis-
tical constraints. An IBM study has compared different 
indoor intervention strategies and suggested outdoor inter-
vention should be added in settings with exophilic vectors; 
however, outdoor intervention was not evaluated directly in 
this study [48]. A mathematical modelling study has found 
that the use of LLINs in combination with ATSBs can 
achieve significantly better control of anopheline mosqui-
toes than LLINs combined with IRS, and the ATSB–LLIN 
combination was relatively effective against outdoor-biting 
Anopheles arabiensis mosquitoes [49]. However, the ATSB 
intervention was not specified as indoor or outdoor due to 
lack of a spatial component in the model.
Community trials are appropriate for these evalua-
tions. However, it can be difficult to identify villages as 
comparable sites in both demographics and environ-
mental factors. In addition, a randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) is very time and resource-consuming. To avoid 
Conclusions: The results highlight the value of incorporating outdoor vector control into IVM as a supplement to 
traditional indoor practices for malaria elimination in Africa, especially in village settings of clustered houses where 
LLINs alone is far from sufficient.

ethical consequences, more complicated designs such 
as stepwise design may be needed. Therefore, a spatial 
IBM that simulates the life cycle of Anopheles gambiae 
mosquitoes and their interactions with the environment, 
humans, and the vector control interventions may be 
the most pragmatic way to initially predict the conse-
quences of combining outdoor and indoor interventions 
to guide further empirical studies. The objectives of this 
study are to: (1) compare the immediate (during effi-
cacy period) and long-term (after losing efficacy) reduc-
tions of malaria vectors and entomological inoculation 
rate (EIR) between indoor and outdoor interventions to 
evaluate the necessity of incorporating outdoor vector 
control into IVM programme; and (2) estimate the effect 
of efficacy periods to guide schedule of maintenance and 
replacement of the intervention tools.
Methods
Model design
For this study, a previous IBM that simulated the inter-
actions between An. gambiae mosquitoes and humans, 
environment, and ATSBs was updated with the features 
of LLINs. The details of the basic model design were 
introduced in two previous studies, one evaluating the 
impact of environmental resources on the survival and 
biting behaviour of An. gambiae [50] and the other com-
paring the effectiveness of different spatial configurations 
of ATSB treatment [41]. A summary of the model used in 
this study is as follows:
Environment
A hypothetical isolated African village of 600 × 600 m 
with 25 houses was simulated. To simulate an environ-
ment representing the village configuration of clustered 
houses like those is Mali, the 25 houses were randomly 
located in the 100 × 100 m center of the simulated envi-
ronment; to simulate the other type of environment 
which has dispersed settlement of houses, the 25 houses 
were randomly located in the whole simulated environ-
ment. Fifty natural sugar sources, 50 outdoor resting 
sites, and 50 larval habitats were randomly placed in the 
whole village to simulate a “resource rich” environment.
Human
A hundred humans were simulated, and they walked ran-
domly outdoors from 7:00 to 19:59, went back home and 
walked inside their houses from 20:00 to 22:59, after 23:00 
they went to bed and were protected by LLINs if covered.
Female Anopheles gambiae
Female An. gambiae were active during night (19:00 
to 05:00). Each mosquito had its physiological status 
recorded in the model: age, energy level, need for blood, 
and gravid status. In each step, each mosquito performed 
different behaviours: fly, sugar feed, blood feed, oviposit, 
or rest, depending on the environmental factors and their 
own physiological status. The maximum lifespan was 
30 days [51–53]. The extrinsic incubation period was 
10 days [54, 55]. The mosquitoes were assumed to have 
a 20% chance of being infected by biting a human once 
[56–63], natural history of malaria in human was not 
considered here because of the complexity and uncer-
tainty of malaria immunity [64]. More details of the den-
sity-dependent development of mosquito aquatic stages 
were described in a previous study [41].
Intervention
Long-lasting insecticidal nets were used as the example 
of the indoor intervention since LLINs are the WHO-
recommended and commonly used indoor tool. When a 
LLIN was efficacious, it protected a human sleeping inside 
it from mosquito bites and killed mosquitoes that con-
tacted with it; no insecticide resistance was simulated in 
the model because limited data is available on it, additional 
assumptions could lead to greater uncertainty. Beyond 
the efficacy period, both physical and chemical protec-
tion was removed to mimic holes on the nets and the loss 
of insecticide efficacy. ATSB is considered one of the best 
outdoor tools available currently, and so bait stations were 
placed in 7 × 7 grid configuration [41] over the whole site 
as the example of the outdoor intervention. The bait sta-
tions attracted and killed sugar-feeding mosquitoes. The 
efficacy for both LLINs and ATSBs were simulated to be 
binomial (on/off) instead of gradual degrading because 
data is limited on the degrading pattern of the two tools, 
and physical damage could be common in both tools, 
which is consistent with the binomial pattern. In addition, 
the efficacy periods were increased by month, increasing 
the resolution to day or second may not have significant 
impact on the comparisons between different interven-
tions. Three interventions were simulated: 50% LLIN cov-
erage, ATSBs alone, and 50% LLIN coverage plus ATSBs. 
The three interventions were introduced in different simu-
lations at the beginning of day 1 (the initial equilibration 
of mosquito population), and efficacy periods (time when 
interventions remain efficacious) of 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 
and 180 days were simulated. Two controls for each of the 
three interventions were used: one was the negative con-
trol, in which no intervention was applied; the other was 
the positive control, in which continuous efficacy period 
until the end of the simulation (day 420) was simulated. 
Each simulation scenario was repeated 50 times.
Data analysis
Four measures were calculated and analysed to examine 
the effects of different interventions and efficacy periods. 
 Page 4 of 11
Zhu et al. Malar J  (2017) 16:266 
To describe the best possible effects while the interven-
tions were efficacious, means of mosquito population 
sizes and annual EIRs at the last day of the efficacy peri-
ods (e.g. day 60 for ATSB intervention with an efficacy 
period of 60 days, day 90 for 50% LLIN coverage with an 
efficacy period of 90 days) were compared between dif-
ferent interventions and efficacy periods. To control for 
the over dispersion and fit the data distribution, negative 
binomial regression models with a square root trans-
formation of the outcomes were selected. Intervention 
type, efficacy period, and their interaction were included 
in the model. The annual EIRs were derived as daily EIR 
times 365 days, daily EIRs were calculated as the total 
number of infectious bites per human per day. A value 
of 0.0001 was added to EIRs to eliminate cells with zero 
variance and enable model fitting. To describe the long-
term effects after the interventions lost efficacy, the prob-
abilities of mosquito population extinction at the end of 
simulation (day 420) were compared between different 
interventions and efficacy periods using a logistic regres-
sion model. Intervention type, efficacy period, and their 
interaction were included in the model. Interventions 
that had none of the 50 trials ending up with extinction 
were excluded from the analysis. To describe the overall 
effects, the total number of days while EIR was reduced 
to the level below one per person per year for each inter-
vention and efficacy period were compared using a nega-
tive binomial regression model.
Results
The environment simulated in this model represented 
a malaria endemic village: in the 600 × 600 m area, 
female An. gambiae mosquito populations equilibrated at 
around 400 without any intervention. Annual EIR equili-
brated at around 200 infectious bites per person per year.
Figure 1 shows the dynamics of female mosquito popu-
lation with different intervention types and efficacy peri-
ods in the two types of village configurations. Mosquito 
populations dropped sharply in the first 30 days following 
the treatments and then decreased slowly toward equili-
bration in the next 30 days. Mosquito populations began 
to reestablish immediately after the efficacy period of the 
interventions. However, with different types of interven-
tions and efficacy periods, the re-equilibrated mosquito 
populations averaged at different levels. The mosquito 
populations were the means (averages) of 50 repeated 
simulations. In a proportion of the 50 repetitions, mos-
quito populations were reduced to very low levels and 
reestablished to the negative control level. In the other 
repetitions, mosquito populations were annihilated, so 
smaller means of re-equilibrated population sizes rep-
resent lower chances of recovery to a negative control 
level. Interventions of or with outdoor ATSB treatment 
led to better mosquito control results, especially in vil-
lage setting of clustered houses. The detailed comparison 
of immediate and long-term effects of different interven-
tions and efficacy periods in the two village configura-
tions are presented in Tables 1, 2 and 3.   
Table 1 shows the means of mosquito population sizes 
and annual EIRs at the last day of the efficacy periods for 
different intervention types and efficacy periods. In the 
village setting with clustered houses, female population 
size was reduced from over 400 in negative control to a 
range of 2–193, and annual EIR was reduced from over 
200 to a range of 0–4 with different intervention types 
and efficacy periods. The results of the negative bino-
mial regression model show that all three interventions 
reduced mosquito population and EIR to significantly 
lower levels than negative control (Ps < 0.0001), outdoor 
ATSB intervention reduced mosquito population and 
EIR to significantly lower levels than 50% LLIN inter-
vention (P < 0.0001), the intervention of 50% LLINs plus 
outdoor ATSBs reduced mosquito population to signifi-
cantly lower level than the intervention of ATSBs alone 
(P < 0.0001), however, EIR was not significantly different 
between the combinational intervention and outdoor 
ATSB alone (P = 0.3178). Interventions with efficacy 
period of 2 months or longer reduced mosquito popula-
tion to significantly lower levels than efficacy period of 
1 month (Ps < 0.0001), and there was no significant differ-
ence in EIR between different efficacy periods (Ps > 0.05).
In the village setting with dispersed houses, female 
population size was reduced from over 400 in negative 
control to a range of 1–36, and annual EIR was reduced 
from over 200 to a range of 0–0.4 with different interven-
tion types and efficacy periods. All the three interven-
tions reduced population size and EIR to significantly 
lower levels than negative control (P < 0.0001). Although 
the differences of population size between each interven-
tion type were still statistically significant (Ps < 0.0001), 
the absolute differences between 50% LLIN and outdoor 
ATSB were much smaller than those in the village setting 
with clustered houses. There was no significant differ-
ence in EIR between the three interventions (P > 0.05). 
In addition, there was no significant difference in EIR 
between different efficacy periods (P > 0.05).
Table 2 shows the probabilities (proportions of tri-
als) of mosquito extinction for each intervention type 
and efficacy period after the interventions lost efficacy. 
In the village setting of clustered houses, the probability 
of mosquito extinction was increased from 0 to a range 
of 0–90% by the three interventions. Outdoor ATSB 
intervention increased the probability to significantly 
higher levels than 50% LLIN intervention (P < 0.0001), 
and the intervention of 50% LLINs plus outdoor ATSBs 
increased the probability to significantly higher level than

the intervention of outdoor ATSBs alone (P < 0.0001). 
Longer efficacy periods significantly increased the prob-
ability of mosquito extinction (Ps < 0.0001), except that 
there was no significant difference between efficacy peri-
ods of 3–6 months (Ps > 0.05).
In the village setting of dispersed houses, the prob-
ability of mosquito extinction was increased from 0 to 
a range of 4–90% by the three interventions. The inter-
vention of 50% LLINs plus outdoor ATSBs increased the 
probability to significantly higher level than the other 
two interventions (Ps < 0.0001), but there was no signifi-
cant difference between the intervention of 50% LLINs 
and outdoor ATSB alone (P = 0.2286), except that with 
efficacy period of 1 month, 50% LLINs intervention led 
to a significant higher probability than outdoor ATSB 
intervention (P = 0.0108). The comparison between dif-
ferent efficacy periods was similar with that in the village 
setting of clustered houses: longer efficacy periods sig-
nificantly increased the probability of mosquito extinc-
tion (Ps < 0.0001), except that there was no significant

(Ps > 0.05).
Table 3 shows the proportion of time that EIR was 
reduced to below one per person per year for differ-
ent intervention types and efficacy periods. In the vil-
lage setting of clustered houses, the proportion of time 
that EIR was less than one was increased from 13.68% 
to a range of 20.31–98.77% by the three interventions. 
Outdoor ATSB intervention increased the proportion 
of time to significantly higher levels than 50% LLIN 
intervention (P < 0.0001), and the intervention of 50% 
LLINs plus outdoor ATSBs increased the probability to 
significantly higher level than the intervention of out-
door ATSBs alone (P = 0.0002). Longer efficacy peri-
ods significantly increased the proportion of time most 
of times (Ps < 0.05), except that there was no significant 
difference between efficacy periods of 3 and 4 months 
(P = 0.2666), 4 and 5 months (P = 0.3015), 4 and 
6 months (P = 0.0940), and 5 and 6 months (P = 0.5207).
In the village setting of dispersed houses, the propor-
tion of time that EIR was less than one was increased 
from 4.35% to a range of 20.68–99.00% by the three inter-
ventions. The intervention of 50% LLINs plus outdoor 
ATSBs increased the probability to significantly higher 
level than the other two interventions (Ps < 0.0001), 
but there was no significant difference between the 
intervention of 50% LLINs and outdoor ATSB alone 
(P = 0.6493), except that with efficacy period of 1 month, 
50% LLINs intervention led to a significant higher pro-
portion than outdoor ATSB intervention (P < 0.0001). 
Longer efficacy periods significantly increased the pro-
portion of time most of times (Ps < 0.05), except that 
there was no significant difference between efficacy peri-
ods of 3–6 months (Ps > 0.05).
Discussion
In this study, the potential benefits of incorporating out-
door vector control into the widely used indoor vector 
control strategy (LLINs) in a malaria endemic village 
were evaluated by simulating three types of indoor and 
outdoor control interventions with different efficacy peri-
ods. According to WHO recommendations and current 
research findings, LLINs with 50% coverage were used 
as the example of indoor mosquito control; a pattern of 
ATSB stations placed in a 7 × 7 grid configuration over 
the whole area was used as the example of outdoor mos-
quito control. Incorporating outdoor ATSB intervention 
significantly improved both immediate and long-term 
effects of mosquito and malaria control, especially in the 
village setting with clustered houses.
The mosquito population size and EIR at the last 
day of efficacy periods is the best possible effect of an

intervention with a certain efficacy period, which rep-
resents the immediate effect. The results show that all 
three types of interventions are effective at reducing 
mosquito population and EIR, however, to achieve a bet-
ter mosquito control result, outdoor ATSBs alone or the 
combination of 50% LLINs and outdoor ATSBs is sug-
gested, especially in village setting of clustered houses 
where even outdoor ATSBs alone achieved substantially 
lower population size than 50% LLINs. The difference in 
EIR between different interventions was smaller, thus to 
only achieve EIR reduction, if resources are limited, out-
door ATSBs alone in village setting of clustered houses 
is acceptable, and either 50% LLINs or outdoor ATSBs 
alone in village setting of dispersed houses is accept-
able. In addition, for any interventions, a minimum of 
2 months of efficacy period is needed to bring out the 
best possible effectiveness. This provides guidance for 
schedule of tool maintenance and education for the 
human compliance.
The probability of local mosquito extinction after the 
interventions lose efficacy represents the long-term 
effect. The explanation for the long-term mosquito 
reduction may be that a good combination of interven-
tions can rapidly knock down the mosquito populations 
to very low levels; and after a certain time, as the exist-
ing eggs develop to adults and are killed and as overall 
reproduction decreases, the population can be locally 
eliminated. In both village settings, the combinational 
intervention of 50% LLIN and outdoor ATSBs was sug-
gested to achieve the best long-term mosquito control 
results. Even with very limited resources, intervention 
of 50% LLINs alone is not suggested in village setting of 
clustered houses. In addition, a minimum of 3 months of 
efficacy period is needed to achieve the best long-term 
mosquito reduction.
There is a study showing that malaria elimination can 
be achieved when annual EIR is below one [65]. The 
results of the proportion of time when annual EIR is 
less than one represents the overall protection. In both 
village settings, incorporating outdoor ATSBs into the 
LLIN intervention with an efficacy period of 3 months 
or longer achieved the same level of protection as the 
other two interventions with continuous efficacy until 
the end of simulation. This suggests that an investment of 
the combinational intervention short-term may save the 
work of long-time maintenance of the interventions.
The underlying mechanism for the increase in effective-
ness by the incorporation of the outdoor ATSB interven-
tion is that the outdoor ATSBs not only killed mosquitoes 
that entered houses, but also killed those searching for 
sugar meals outdoors. LLINs only target the mosquitoes 
searching for a blood meal indoors, and these mosquitoes 
constitute a proportion of the mosquito population since 
females would blood feed mainly once per gonotrophic 
cycle (3 days in average) [66–68]. Whereas outdoor 
ATSBs target the mosquitoes searching for sugar meals, 
which constitute a larger proportion of the mosquito 
population since they require at least one sugar meal 
per night for energy and more activity would increase 
the needs for sugar meals [37, 69]. In addition, ATSBs 
can well target male An. gambiae mosquitoes because 
males solely feed on sugar for energy and they require 
at least two sugar meals per night [69]. Male mosquitoes 
were simulated in ten repetitions and followed similar 
population dynamic patterns as females, so they were 
not included in the results. However, as outdoor ATSBs 
killed more male mosquitoes, it would reduce the mat-
ing opportunities for females, which would either lead 
to lower mosquito reproduction or additional flights for 
females and hence increased mortality. Successful mat-
ing was assumed in the model, if mating opportunity was 
taken into account, outdoor ATSB intervention may have 
even better vector control results. In the current model, 
a sugar-rich village was simulated. Whereas in villages 
that lack natural sugar resources, or during dry seasons, 
the outdoor ATSB intervention could achieve even better 
results [41].
A LLIN coverage of 50% was used in this study, this is 
due to the fact that according to the estimation by WHO, 
the average bed net coverage increased from less than 
2% in 2000 to an estimated 55% in 2015 [70]. Except for 
the considerations of incorporating outdoor vector con-
trol, there are also considerations of scaling up LLIN 
coverage for malaria elimination. However, most studies 
evaluating the effectiveness of scaling up LLIN coverage 
investigated the effect where the coverage rate increased 
from very low to intermediate/high level and showed 
significant reduction of malaria transmission [71–74], 
but there is no empirical evidence showing that further 
increasing the coverage can reduce malaria transmission: 
only one study evaluated locations with this magnitude 
of increase, and the results showed that asexual para-
site prevalence decreased significantly, but gametocyte 
prevalence did not [75]. In addition, results from another 
RCT showed that universal LLIN coverage did not reduce 
malaria transmission than targeted LLIN coverage for 
pregnant women and children under six [76]. These are 
consistent with the results of 100% LLIN intervention 
in this study, which are not reported here. The results of 
the simulations show that there was no significant differ-
ence between 100% coverage and 50% coverage. Another 
explanation for this phenomenon may be that no insec-
ticide resistance was simulated for LLIN. However, with 
50% LLIN coverage, if behavioural resistance in mosqui-
toes was simulated, the mosquitoes could avoid LLINs 
and select those unprotected human for blood-feeding. 
 Page 9 of 11
Zhu et al. Malar J  (2017) 16:266 
Since those unprotected humans could then compen-
sate the reduced bites for those protected under LLINs, 
the EIR could be higher in 50% LLINs in reality, and thus 
the difference between 50 and 100% coverages could be 
greater. Because of the simplification of not including 
insecticide resistance in this model, the relevant results 
can be inaccurate and are not included. Further model-
ling studies with these details and empirical studies are 
needed for the confirmation of the effectiveness of scal-
ing up LLIN coverage.
One limitation of the study was that the simulated vil-
lage was isolated/closed to influx of mosquitoes from the 
outside. Thus, after the mosquito population was knocked 
down, the effect could be sustained even after the loss of 
interventions efficacy. However, previous studies have 
shown that malaria can be locally eliminated when vector 
density is below a certain threshold [77, 78]. If the influx 
of mosquitoes is below a certain level and not able to rees-
tablish the population, the effect of control may still be 
sustained. In addition, anopheline mosquitoes have a maxi-
mum dispersal range from several 100 m to almost 3000 m 
[79]. With limited human migration between villages, if 
the villages are separated by distances exceeding the maxi-
mum dispersal range, especially in arid environments, or 
if several villages are treated at the same time in a big area 
exceeding the maximum dispersal range, then “isolation” 
can be achieved and local extinction may be sustained.
In this study, ATSB stations placed outdoor in 7 × 7 
grid configuration over the whole area was used to rep-
resent outdoor adult mosquito control in general. ATSB 
attracts sugar-seeking mosquitoes from a distance and 
are not limited by constraints of insecticide resistance; in 
fact, ATSB is being considered as a new tool for break-
ing insecticide resistance. Generalization from the study 
results from this study to other available outdoor vector 
control tools should be careful because of these advan-
tages of ATSB tool. No insecticide resistance was simu-
lated for the indoor LLIN treatments, and no damage was 
simulated for the outdoor ATSB treatments during its 
efficacy period. However, in reality, these perfect condi-
tions are never achieved. Therefore, this study may have 
over-estimated the effectiveness of both tool. Neverthe-
less, even with the simplifications in this modelling study, 
it provides insights of how expanding mosquito control 
from inside houses to a larger scale outdoors can benefit 
overall vector and malaria control.
Conclusions
In summary, incorporating outdoor vector control inter-
ventions such as ATSBs into IVM strategies is suggested 
for malaria elimination, especially in village setting of 
clustered houses where indoor LLINs alone are far from 
sufficient. With the combination of indoor and outdoor 
vector control interventions, it is likely that mosquito 
population will become locally extinct even after the effi-
cacy period of the interventions in certain conditions, 
leading to long-term mosquito control and EIR reduc-
tion. Further confirmation from empirical studies are 
recommended to provide additional evidence for updat-
ing the malaria elimination policy.
