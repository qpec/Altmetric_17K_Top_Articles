ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND The ideal cardiovascular health score (ICHS) is recommended for use in primary prevention. Simpler
tools not requiring laboratory tests, such as the Fuster-BEWAT (blood pressure [B], exercise [E], weight [W], alimentation
[A], and tobacco [T]) score (FBS), are also available.
OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of ICHS and FBS in predicting the presence
and extent of subclinical atherosclerosis.
METHODS A total of 3,983 participants 40 to 54 years of age were enrolled in the PESA (Progression of Early
Subclinical Atherosclerosis) cohort. Subclinical atherosclerosis was measured in right and left carotids, abdominal aorta,
right and left iliofemoral arteries, and coronary arteries. Subjects were classified as having poor, intermediate, or ideal
cardiovascular health based on the number of favorable ICHS or FBS.
RESULTS With poor ICHS and FBS as references, individuals with ideal ICHS and FBS showed lower adjusted odds
of having atherosclerotic plaques (ICHS odds ratio [OR]: 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31 to 0.55 vs. FBS OR: 0.49;
95% CI: 0.36 to 0.66), coronary artery calcium (CACS) $1 (CACS OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.60 vs. CACS OR: 0.53;
95% CI: 0.38 to 0.74), higher number of affected territories (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.41 vs. OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.31 to
0.50), and higher CACS level (OR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.58 vs. OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.72). Similar levels of
significantly discriminating accuracy were found for ICHS and FBS with respect to the presence of plaques (C-statistic:
0.694; 95% CI: 0.678 to 0.711 vs. 0.692; 95% CI: 0.676 to 0.709, respectively) and for CACS $1 (C-statistic: 0.782;
95% CI: 0.765 to 0.800 vs. 0.780; 95% CI: 0.762 to 0.798, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS Both scores predict the presence and extent of subclinical atherosclerosis with similar accuracy,
highlighting the value of the FBS as a simpler and more affordable score for evaluating the risk of subclinical disease.

ardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the first
cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide
(1,2). In 2010, the American Heart Associa-
tion proposed a new paradigm by shifting the classic
focus on reducing the prevalence of CVD to a national
goal of improving CV health in the population by
measuring
the
ideal
cardiovascular
health
score
(ICHS) (3). The ICHS metrics focus on a number of life-
style factors (smoking, body weight, physical activity,
and diet) and 3 established risk factors (blood choles-
terol, blood glucose, and blood pressure). Since 2010,
extensive research has explored the prevalence of
ideal CV health in different populations showing
very low prevalence of ideal ICHS metrics overall (4)
and its association with lower CVD and all-cause mor-
tality (5).
The association between ICHS metrics and sub-
clinical disease is a key area of interest to explore
the pathways underlying the associations between
ICHS and CV risk (6). Among several markers of
subclinical CVD, the coronary artery calcification
score (CACS) has been identified as one of the most
robust markers of subclinical disease and predictor
of future CVD events (7). Higher ICHS metrics are
associated with lower CACS (8–11). The association
among ICHS and other markers of subclinical dis-
ease, such as the carotid intima-media thickness
(12,13), carotid plaque area (13), and pulse wave ve-
locity as a measurement of arterial stiffness (14,15)
has been investigated, but their predictive value is
limited (16,17). To the best of our knowledge, the
association
between
ICHS
metrics
and
extensive
subclinical atherosclerosis measured by the presence
of atherosclerotic plaques in several arterial regions
has not been studied yet.
In addition to ICHS, other screening tools, such as
the Fuster-BEWAT (blood pressure [B], exercise [E],
weight [W], alimentation [A], and tobacco [T]) score
(FBS) (18) have been recently developed for use in
lifestyle-based CVD prevention. FBS collects clinical
information on lifestyle and risk factors including
smoking, physical activity, diet (fruit and vegetable
consumption), body weight, and blood pressure, but
contrary to ICHS, it does not require laboratory re-
sults, making it easier and more suitable for use.
Nevertheless, whether FBS is useful for predicting
subclinical atherosclerosis and whether its discrimi-
nating accuracy is similar to ICHS are unknown.
This study, first, explored the association between
ICHS
and
FBS
metrics
and
the
presence
and
extent of subclinical atherosclerosis measured by
2-dimensional (2D)-carotid, aortic, and iliofe-
moral vascular ultrasonography and CACS by
computed
tomography
(CT)
and,
second,
compared the accuracy of both scores for
predicting subclinical atherosclerosis.
METHODS
STUDY
DESIGN
AND
POPULATION. The
PESA
(Progression
of
Early
Subclinical
Atherosclerosis) study rationale and design
have been described elsewhere (19). Briefly,
PESA is a prospective cohort study of 4,184
asymptomatic
employees
of
Banco
Santander
in
Madrid (Spain), 40 to 54 years of age, and free of CVD;
the study was designed to assess the prevalence and
determinants of subclinical atherosclerosis. Partici-
pants
underwent
a
complete
clinical
evaluation,
blood
and
urine
analysis,
lifestyle
questionnaire
analysis, accelerometry assessment of physical ac-
tivity, electrocardiography, and assessment of sub-
clinical
atherosclerosis
by
noninvasive
vascular
imaging tests, including 2D vascular ultrasonography
and CT for CACS measurement. Complete data for the
actual analysis were available for 3,983 participants
(95.2%). The Ethics Committee of Instituto de Salud
Carlos III in Madrid, Spain, approved the study pro-
tocol, and written informed consent was obtained
from each participant prior to enrollment.
ASSESSMENT OF PARTICIPANTS’ CHARACTERISTICS:
LIFESTYLE AND CVD RISK FACTORS. Conventional
risk factors, such as smoking habits, and a diagnosis
of hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia, or family
history of CVD were previously defined (20) and were
collected as part of each participant’s medical history.
Blood pressure was measured at rest by using an
automatic oscillometric sphygmomanometer (Omron
Hem-907, Omron Healthcare, Kyoto, Japan). Anthro-
pometric measurements were obtained following a
standardized
procedure.
Body
mass
index
was
calculated as body mass in divided by the partici-
pant’s height squared (kg/m2). Blood and urine sam-
ples were collected after >8 h of fasting. Dietary
intake was assessed by using a computerized ques-
tionnaire
(Dietary
History-Enrica)
(21),
previously
validated
(22),
conducted
by
trained
dieticians,
designed to record habitual food intake over the
previous year. Physical activity was assessed by
triaxial accelerometry (ActiTrainer accelerometers;
Actigraph, Pensacola, Florida) during 7 consecutive
days, including sleeping time. Moderate and vigorous
levels of physical activity were defined according to
Troiano cutoff points (23).

 VASCULAR
ULTRASONOGRAPHY. Imaging
studies
included
2D
vascular
ultrasonography
of
carotid
arteries, infrarenal aortas, and iliofemoral arteries and
CACS by CT scan. Vascular ultrasonography was
performed using an iU22 ultrasound station (Philips
Healthcare,
Bothell,
Washington),
with
adapted
scanning protocols (20). Plaques were defined as any
focal protrusion of more than 0.5 mm or more than
50% thicker than the surrounding intima-media (24).
CACS were estimated by using the Agatston method by
noncontrast
electrocardiography-gated
prospective
acquisition, using a 16-slice Brilliance CT scanner
(Philips Healthcare, Andover, Massachusetts) (20) and
graded as <1, 1 to <100, 100 to <400, or $400 (25).
The PESA Core Imaging Laboratory at the Centro
Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos
III analyzed all imaging recordings.
DEFINITION OF SUBCLINICAL ATHEROSCLEROSIS.
Subclinical atherosclerosis at each vascular site was
defined as the presence of any atherosclerotic plaque
in the carotid, aortic, or iliofemoral territory or having

 CACS of $1. The number of vascular sites affected
(right carotid, left carotid, abdominal aorta, right
iliofemoral artery, left iliofemoral and coronary ar-
teries) was used for defining the multiterritorial
extent of subclinical atherosclerosis and classified as
disease free (no vascular sites affected) or as having
focal (1 site), intermediate (2 to 3 sites), or generalized
(4 to 6 sites) atherosclerosis (20).
CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH METRICS. The 7 ICHS
behaviors
and
risk
factors
(exercise,
body
mass
index, diet, smoking status, blood pressure, serum
cholesterol, and fasting glucose) were classified ac-
cording to American Heart Association definitions (3)
as
poor,
intermediate,
or
ideal
(Table
1).
Each
component was then dichotomized as being ideal
versus nonideal, and subjects were classified as hav-
ing poor, intermediate, or ideal CV health based on
the total number of ideal metrics (0 to 2 poor, 3 to 5
intermediate, 6 to 7 ideal) (2).
The 5 FBS components, blood pressure (B), exer-
cise (E), weight (W), alimentation (A), and tobacco
(T), were divided into 4 categories ranging from 0 to 3
according to the previously published description
(Table 2) (18). Each component was dichotomized as
ideal (3) or nonideal (0 to 2), and subjects were clas-
sified as having poor, intermediate, or ideal CV health
based on the total number of ideal components (0 to 1
poor, 2 to 3 intermediate, 4 to 5 ideal).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. All statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS software version 20.0 (IBM,
Armonk, New York). Subclinical atherosclerosis was
dichotomized as presence of plaque versus no plaque.
CACS was dichotomized as <1 and $1 Agatston unit.
Distribution of each individual ICHS (classified as
poor, intermediate, ideal) and FBS (classified as 0, 1,
2, 3) metrics are presented for the total sample and
stratified by sex, as well as by distribution of the
number of ideal metrics for each score.

Ideal Cardiovascular Health and Atherosclerosis
2467
 Associations between individual metrics in the ICHS
and FBS and the presence of subclinical atheroscle-
rosis defined as having plaque or CACS $1 were
examined by use of logistic regression models. The
associations between the ICHS and FBS categorized as
poor, intermediate, and ideal and the presence of
subclinical atherosclerosis were also examined by lo-
gistic regression models. Ordinal regression models
were fitted to explore the association between ICHS
and FBS and the multiterritorial extent of subclinical
atherosclerosis and the amount of CACS (divided
into <1, 1 to <100, 100 to <400, and $400 Agatston
units). All regression models were adjusted for age,
sex, family CVD history, and educational level. The
C-statistic or area under the receiver operating char-
acteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and 95% confidence in-
terval (CI) were calculated for each model as a measure
of the discriminatory power of each score.
RESULTS
The mean age of the 3,983 participants was 45.8 � 4.3
years (62.8% men). The 10-year Framingham risk
score was 5.8 � 4.3 for the total sample (men: 7.7 �
4.3; women: 2.8 � 2.0), and the 30-year Framingham
risk score was 17.7 � 11.7 overall (men: 22.8 � 11.3;
women: 9.1 � 6.0).
Overall, only 3.2% of subjects met all 7 ideal ICHS
metrics, whereas 6.5% of subjects met all 5 ideal FBS
metrics (Tables 1 and 2). Most of the sample (71.7%)
met between 3 and 5 ideal ICHS metrics (intermediate
CV health). Likewise, 61.2% of the sample met be-
tween 2 and 3 ideal FBS components (intermediate CV
health). The overall prevalence of a favorable ICHS (at
least 6 ideal metrics) or favorable FBS (at least 4 ideal
metrics) was 17.8% and 31.0%, respectively. Women
presented a significantly higher number of ideal
metrics in both scores and significantly higher pro-
portion of ideal levels in all metrics, except for fruit
and vegetable consumption and smoking status.
Among health behaviors, ideal dietary metrics had
the lowest prevalence (18.8% for ICHS and 25.5% for
FBS), whereas ideal physical activity levels were
highly prevalent (93.0% for ICHS and 93.4% for
FBS). The prevalence of ideal blood pressure was
59.7% for ICHS and 61.5% for FBS, and ideal body
mass index prevalence was 41.5% for both scores. The
prevalence of ideal total cholesterol and plasma
glucose, assessed only for ICHS, was 47.0% and
86.8%, respectively. Nonsmokers represented 68.9%
and 72.0% of the total sample according to the ICHS
and FBS, respectively.
SUBCLINICAL
ATHEROSCLEROSIS
AND
ASSOCIATION
WITH ICHS AND FBS RESULTS. The presence of at least 1
atherosclerotic plaque could be identified in 2,377
subjects (59.7%), more frequently in men than in
women, and more often in the iliofemoral bed than in
other
arterial
beds
(Online
Table
1).
Although
involvement of multiple territories was found in 1,619
individuals (40.7%), calcium calcification with Agat-
ston score $1 was observed in 700 participants (17.6%).
Overall, there was a strong inverse association be-
tween ICHS and FBS and subclinical atherosclerosis.
Compared with participants categorized as having
poor ICHS (0 to 2 ideal factors) or poor FBS (0 to 1 ideal
factor), adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for plaque presence
and for CACS $1 were significantly lower among sub-
jects classified as having intermediate and ideal scores
(Table 3). The association between the individual
components of both scores and subclinical athero-
sclerosis is shown in Online Table 2. Both scores were
also associated with the extent of subclinical athero-
sclerosis and with the degree of coronary calcification
(Central Illustration, Table 4, Online Figure 1).

subjects with ideal ICHS or ideal FBS, taking the
poorest score as a reference (p < 0.001 for all com-
parisons).
The

analysis
showed
equivalent
discriminating accuracy levels for both models in

atherosclerosis:
ICHS C-statistic of 0.779 (95% CI: 0.759 to 0.795); a
FBS C-statistic of 0.773 (95% CI: 0.752 to 0.795); and
very similar values in predicting CACS $400 level,
with ICHS C-statistic of 0.881 (95% CI: 0.836 to 0.925)
and an FBS C-statistic of 0.861 (95% CI: 0.816 to
0.907) (Table 4, Online Figure 1).
DISCUSSION
Better profiles of CV health behaviors and risk factors,
reflected by higher ICHS and FBS metrics, are strongly
associated with a lower prevalence and a lower extent
of subclinical atherosclerosis in healthy individuals.

 This is good evidence of the impact of lifestyle and
risk factors on the early phase of the disease. Both
scores
showed
good
and
comparable
predictive
values for all outcomes measured in the PESA cohort,
including the presence of any atherosclerotic plaque,
presence and amount of calcium in coronary arteries,
and number of affected arterial sites.
Our study shows an inverse relationship between
ideal CV risk score metrics and the presence of sub-
clinical
atherosclerosis,
evaluated
by
2
different
indices. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
show this relationship with multiterritorial disease in
a large cohort of healthy individuals. Previous studies
evaluating ICHS metrics and subclinical atheroscle-
rosis used coronary calcium as the marker. Robbins
et al. (9) and Bensenor et al. (11) showed a strong in-
verse relationship between ICHS metrics and preva-
lence of coronary artery calcium in adults. Saleem
et al. (10) also found that middle-aged men and
women with a favorable ICHS have a lower prevalence
and severity of subclinical atherosclerosis as esti-
mated by CACS. Ahmed et al. (26) found that regular
exercise, adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet,
smoking
avoidance,
and
maintenance
of
normal
weight were associated with lower CAC incidence and
progression, and significantly lower all-cause mortal-
ity over 7.6 years in participants 44 to 84 years of age
from the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atheroscle-
rosis) study. It has been shown, however, that the
absence of coronary artery calcium does not neces-
sarily mean that individuals are disease free (20). The
high prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques (59.7%)
compared with the prevalence of CACS $1 (17.6%) in
our study suggests that coronary artery calcium rep-
resents a more advanced stage of disease. Other
studies also concluded that exploring several terri-
tories allows overcoming the potential problem of not
detecting lesions when only a single territory is taken
into account (27). In fact, the overall prevalence of
subclinical atherosclerosis found in our cohort is high.
The majority of participants (approximately 80%)
with poor ICHS and FBS in our study presented at
least 1 affected site. However, subclinical athero-
sclerosis was also present in approximately one-half
of the population with ideal ICHS and FBS metrics.
The follow-up data in the PESA cohort will allow
investigating
whether
participants
showing
ideal
ICHS and FBS metrics have less progression of sub-
clinical atherosclerosis and/or lower incidence of
clinical events over time and whether remaining in
ICHS and FBS categories (ideal, intermediate, poor)
leads
to
different rates
of
worsening
subclinical
atherosclerosis and transition to clinical atheroscle-
rosis, including CV events and mortality.
Although the ICHS and the FBS share 5 metrics
(blood pressure, physical activity, dietary metric,
body weight, and tobacco consumption), the ICHS
also includes cholesterol and fasting glucose levels.
Because the FBS does not require laboratory analyses
to be derived and given the comparable predictive
value of both scores, the FBS may be considered a
practical and affordable option with which to foster
primary CV prevention in settings where easy labo-
ratory
data
are
not
available.
This
may
not
be
considered an advantage in high-resource environ-
ments, where routine screening for risk factors by
laboratory analysis are recommended (28,29) but may
be particularly relevant in low resource areas, such as
in developing countries, where the burden of CVD is
growing faster. It also may be used for educational
purposes in nonmedical environments (i.e., schools)
and for personal self-monitoring as a tool to improve
self-CV care.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. It must be acknowledged that
the benefit of predicting subclinical atherosclerosis
is
still
not
well
defined.
Although
subclinical
atherosclerosis precedes clinical cardiovascular dis-
ease, it needs be proven that if, for a given level of
cardiovascular
risk,
people
with
subclinical
non-
coronary atherosclerosis are at higher risk of later
clinical atherosclerosis than
people
without sub-
clinical
atherosclerosis
and
whether
they
may
benefit
from
more
intensive
primary
prevention
strategies at an earlier stage.
A number of other limitations should be consid-
ered when interpreting this study. First, the results
are based on cross-sectional data from the PESA
cohort at baseline and therefore cannot establish
causality. However, the ongoing PESA follow-up will
study the association between CV health and the
progression of subclinical atherosclerosis and sub-
sequent CV events. Second, the PESA cohort consists
of middle-aged participants, predominantly middle-
to high-income
Caucasian
workers not randomly
selected from the general population, and therefore,
the
generalizability
of
the
results
is
limited.
In
comparison with previous reports of the distribution
of ICHS metrics, our sample presents a higher prev-
alence of good ICHS metrics (28,29). Despite these
limitations, the use of contemporary imaging tech-
nology, the systematic and extensive collection of
behavioral and risk factors, and the overall high-
quality
data
profile
obtained
from
a
relatively
young cohort may help provide useful insights into
the
early
stages
of
subclinical
atherosclerosis
and its association with risk and its association
with
CV
risk
and
behavioral
patterns
and

 help understanding their influence on monitoring
atherosclerosis progression.
CONCLUSIONS
The use of scores assessing CV health behaviors and
risk factors is useful for predicting the presence of
subclinical atherosclerosis in healthy adults at low
short-term CV risk. Although the ICHS and the FBS
showed similar predictive values for detecting sub-
clinical disease, the FBS is simpler and does not need
laboratory results. Therefore, it may be considered
the first option in settings where access to laboratory
analysis is limited.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND
PROCEDURAL SKILLS: The ICHS, which incorpo-
rates 7 metrics (exercise, body mass index, diet,
smoking status, blood pressure, and blood
cholesterol and fasting glucose levels), has validated
predictive value for cardiovascular events. The
Fuster-BEWAT score uses 5 metrics (blood pressure
[B], exercise [E], weight [W], alimentation [A], and
tobacco [T]) and does not require laboratory tests.
Both scores exhibit comparable predictive values for
detection of subclinical atherosclerosis in ostensibly
healthy individuals.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: The FBS is an easy,
painless, inexpensive tool that could be implemented
in resource-constrained health care settings to iden-
tify individuals with a high likelihood of subclinical
atherosclerosis at whom preventive management
strategies can be directed.
