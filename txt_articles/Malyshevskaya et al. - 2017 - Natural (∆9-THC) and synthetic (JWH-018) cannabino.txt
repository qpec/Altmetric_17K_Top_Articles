Natural cannabinoids and their synthetic substitutes are the most widely used recreational drugs. 
Numerous clinical cases describe acute toxic symptoms and neurological consequences following 
inhalation of the mixture of synthetic cannabinoids known as “Spice.” Here we report that an 
intraperitoneal administration of the natural cannabinoid Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (10 mg/kg), one 
of the main constituent of marijuana, or the synthetic cannabinoid JWH-018 (2.5 mg/kg) triggered 
electrographic seizures in mice, recorded by electroencephalography and videography. Administration 
of JWH-018 (1.5, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg) increased seizure spikes dose-dependently. Pretreatment of 
mice with AM-251 (5 mg/kg), a cannabinoid receptor 1-selective antagonist, completely prevented 
cannabinoid-induced seizures. These data imply that abuse of cannabinoids can be dangerous and 
represents an emerging public health threat. Additionally, our data strongly suggest that AM-251 could 
be used as a crucial prophylactic therapy for cannabinoid-induced seizures or similar life-threatening 
conditions.
Marijuana (Cannabis sativa L.) is the most commonly abused drug in the United States1, with a similar tendency 
worldwide2. In the last few years its use for recreational and medical purposes has become legal in an increasing 
number of countries3. Particularly, in the United States marijuana use is illegal under federal law, nevertheless, 
it has been legalized by individual state laws for non-medical use in 8 states and is allowed for medical use by 
another 29 states4. A primary component of marijuana, Δ
9-tetrahydrocannabinol (∆9-THC)5, mediates a psy-
choactive effect on the nervous system via cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R), for which it has a low binding affin-
ity (Ki = 39.5 nM)6. However, in recent years, strains of herbal cannabis with an increased CB1R potency have 
appeared: one example is sinsemilla, a female non-pollinated cannabis plant in which the content of ∆9-THC 
has been raised from 3.96% in 1995 to 12.3% in 20141. This recent shift in the generation of high-potency canna-
bis plant material has led to an increasing demand for cannabis-related treatments and emergency department 
admissions stemming from acute anxiety, psychosis or cognitive impairment7–9.
The advent of synthetic cannabinoids (SCs), a type of new recreational drug commonly known on the mar-
ket as “Spice” created additional challenges. Since 2008 SCs have led to increased public awareness as the most 
rapidly growing group of new “legal highs”
, with the ability to escape detection by standard cannabinoid screen-
ing tests. Once some substances have become regulated, novel analogues have emerged on the market to sat-
isfy demand; and the speed of production is outpacing lawmakers’ attempts to ban them10. Most SCs act as full 
agonists at CB1R, with a much higher binding affinity (JWH-018, Ki = 9 nM; CP 47,497, Ki = 2.2 nM; HU210, 
Ki = 0.06 nM) compared to ∆9-THC6, 11. SCs can not only permeate the blood–brain barrier, but they also accu-
mulate in CB1R-rich areas of the brain12, 13. Recently, the number of users displaying pathological behaviors after 
consuming SCs has dramatically increased; symptoms include anxiety, agitation, tachycardia, cardiotoxicity and 
seizures or status epilepticus14, 15. Deaths after SC use have also been documented: SCs were reported in 2014 
to have killed 25 people and sickened more than 700 in northern Russia16. Controlled studies on humans to

examine the action of cannabinoid ligands are difficult, and human data on induction, pharmacokinetics and 
adverse effects are therefore limited to case studies on users after voluntary drug consumption17, 18. At the same 
time, rapid analogue development and the growing popularity of SCs impose a strong demand for evaluation of 
their pharmacology and toxicology to reveal the mechanism of action and to facilitate future development of a 
drug-specific therapy for intoxication.
Here, we report, for the first time, that acute administration of a natural (∆9-THC, 10 mg/kg) or synthetic 
(JWH-018, 2.5 mg/kg) cannabinoid triggered electrographic seizures in mice, recorded by electroencephalog-
raphy (EEG) and videography. We further show that cannabinoid-induced seizures were completely prevented 
by pretreatment of the animals with AM-251 (5 mg/kg), a CB1R-selective antagonist. Our data imply that even 
single use of cannabinoids may result in significant adverse neurological and physical effects and negatively affect 
human health. Finally, based on our results, AM-251 has a strong therapeutic potential for the suppression of 
toxic symptoms induced by cannabinoid abuse, although the human safety need to be established in controlled 
clinical trials.
Results
Cannabinoids induce electrographic seizures. 
We administered ∆9-THC (10 mg/kg) or JWH-018 
(2.5 mg/kg), intraperitoneally to two independent groups of mice and recorded video, EEG, electromyogram 
(EMG) and locomotor activity (LMA). Shortly after administration, we observed a significant decrease in LMA 
and EMG activity that coincided with low-intensity behavioral seizures. Several minutes after cannabinoid 
administration, the EEG trace resembled non-rapid eye movement sleep (Fig. 1A,B). However, detailed inspec-
tion of a magnified view (Fig. 1A,B inset) revealed the presence of electrographic seizures in the form of frequent 
EEG seizure spikes. The average onset latency of electrographic/behavioral seizures was shorter after JWH-018 
(5.4 ± 0.6 min; p < 0.05) compared to ∆9-THC administration (11.1 ± 2.5 min) (Fig. 1A,B). Electrographic sei-
zures were apparent for 256 ± 15.3 minutes after ∆9-THC; however, after JWH-018 administration they persisted

(10 mg/kg) resulted in a high-amplitude EEG shortly after administration. In a magnified view, high-amplitude

Injection of the synthetic cannabinoid JWH-018 (2.5 mg/kg) also resulted in high-amplitude EEG and produced 
seizures, while EMG and LMA were low. (C) Pretreatment with the CB1R-specific antagonist AM-251 (5 mg/kg)

for longer (344 ± 12 min; p < 0.001) and were observed in all tested animals (Fig. 2A). Seizure spike quantification 
analysis revealed significantly more frequent spikes after JWH-018 (25.1 ± 3.1 spikes/min; p < 0.001) compared 
to ∆9-THC administration (12.3 ± 1.4 spikes/min) (Fig. 2B). Isolated EEG seizure spikes were still observed in 
both groups 4 h after administration (Suppl. Figure 1A,C); on the next day, the effect was diminished and no elec-
trographic seizures could be detected (Suppl. Figure 1B,D).
We also observed behavioral changes after administration of JWH-018, including suppression of locomotor 
activity, impaired walking, ataxia, extensor rigidity in both hind limbs, straub tail, muscular jerks, rearing, and 
low-intensity behavioral seizures (Suppl. Video S1). The righting reflex was preserved, whereas the touch escape 
response was impaired. Animals also showed dyspnea (gasps) and profound catatonia (Suppl. Video S2). Similar 
behavioral changes were also observed after ∆9-THC administration; however, their intensity was lower than in 
the group administered JWH-018 (Suppl. Video S3). The maximal severity score reached under both JWH-018 
and ∆9-THC was 3. The occurrence of events of score 2 or higher was more frequent for JWH-018 compared to 
∆9-THC (Suppl. Table 1).
Administration of JWH-018 elicits seizure spikes in a dose-dependent manner. 
To clarify 
whether cannabinoids induce seizure activity in a dose-dependent manner, we quantified spike frequency after 
acute i.p. administration of three different doses of JWH-018: 1.5, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg. The result showed a clear

dose-response relationship, with the number of spikes increasing with dose (18.7 ± 2.7, 25.1 ± 3.1 and 37.1 ± 7.3 
spikes/min respectively, p < 0.01 (1.5 vs. 5 mg/kg) and p < 0.05 (2.5 vs. 5 mg/kg), one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 2C).
CB1R-selective antagonist AM-251 prevents cannabinoid-induced seizures. 
To determine 
whether the proconvulsive properties of cannabinoids were mediated by CB1R, we pretreated mice with AM-251 
(5 mg/kg) 30 min before administration of JWH-018 (2.5 mg/kg). Pretreatment with AM-251 resulted in the 
complete abolition of electrographic seizures: the EEG showed a normal pattern in all animals tested (Fig. 1C). 
Moreover, behavioral abnormalities previously induced by administration of JWH-018 or ∆9-THC were absent 
in these AM-251-pretreated animals. Administration of AM-251 alone produced no detectable changes in the 
EEG or behavior of the animals (Suppl. Figure 2), however no specific behavioral tests, beyond simple observation 
were conducted.
Metabolism of JWH-018 in serum. 
To examine the pharmacokinetics of JWH-018, blood was collected at 
different time points after administration of the drug at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg. After separation of the serum, JWH-
018 and 6 metabolites were measured. In the samples, JWH-018 and JWH-018 N-(4-hydroxypentyl), [JWH-018 
N-(4-OH)], JWH-018 N-pentanoic acid metabolites [JWH-018 N-COOH], JWH-018 5-hydroxyindole [JWH-
018 5-OH indole] metabolites were detected (Fig. 2D,E). Serum JWH-018 concentration reached 45.5 ng/ml 
5 min after administration, with a peak serum concentration of 87.8 ng/ml at 15 min post-injection. After 1 h 
the serum concentration still remained at 55.2 ng/ml and after 3 h the level of JWH-018 persisted at 35.7 ng/ml, 
which was still >40% of the peak concentration. JWH-018 N-(4-OH) metabolite increased in the serum con-
centration with a time profile similar to JWH-018, reaching its peak of 9.1 ng/ml at 15 min and slowly decaying 
to 6.4 ng/ml after 1 h and at 2.5 ng/ml at 3 h. Interestingly, the JWH-018-N-pentanoic acid metabolite (JWH-018 
N-COOH) displayed a much slower increase in concentration, with the highest measured concentration of 4.9 ng/
ml detected at 3 h after JWH-018 administration. JWH-018 5-OH indole metabolite increased in the serum at a 
much lower range of concentrations, with a peak at 0.8 ng/ml 15 min after administration. Other metabolites of 
JWH-018 were detected at low serum levels, with the highest value less than 0.9 ng/ml (data not shown).
Discussion
Analysis of highly synchronized EEG (seizure spikes) and behavioral video recordings provide strong evidence 
for the epileptogenic properties of both synthetic (JWH-018) as well as plant-derived (∆9-THC) cannabinoids. 
Consistent with our data, a previous study has shown that injections of ∆9-THC in rats induce burst activity in 
the EEG19; and even a single dose of ∆9-THC can promote a long-lasting elevation of neuronal excitability, thus 
increasing susceptibility to seizure20. On the other hand, a substantial body of literature on cannabinoids in ani-
mal models shows mostly anticonvulsive effects21. However, few of these used EEG recordings to assess epileptic 
events and many of them induced seizures either electrically or pharmacologically, changing signalling pathways 
and brain states prior to cannabinoid application.
Since the discovery of the cannabinoid system (CB1R, CB2R and endogenous cannabinoids), their physiolog-
ical properties have been extensively discussed and contradictory findings have been reported in humans as well. 
Some studies suggest that cannabinoids exert severe side effects along with strong proconvulsive properties22, 23, 
whereas others have shown anticonvulsive effects and used cannabinoids as a “relief drug” for severe epilepsy 
cases24, 25. Despite such attempts to use medical marijuana in the treatment of intractable epilepsy, the medical 
evidence supporting its use for the treatment of neurological diseases is not sufficiently convincing26, and evi-
dence for the safety and efficacy of cannabinoids that would allow them to be used clinically remains weak. It is 
also important to note that in these human studies ∆9-THC was rarely used as a pure chemical, but as a part of 
marijuana plants or medical preparations, containing cannabidiol, another component of Cannabis sativa, that 
exerts major antiepileptic effects27.
Because we intentionally used higher doses which produce toxicity and induce seizures, these doses might 
have effects not representative of those seen with typical medicinal or recreational human consumption. It would 
be interesting in the future to also test lower doses, typically used medicinally or recreationally to determine 
whether the effect is lost or diminished. As we show here, seizures induced by cannabinoids are typically mild 
and almost asymptomatic to the untrained eye - therefore careful EEG evaluation would be needed. The highest 
reported concentration of JWH-018 in our study was 87 ng/ml at 15 min after administration, which is about 9 to 
17 times higher than the value published in a controlled human studies after inhalation18, 28, where doses are far 
away from toxic ones for humane and safety reasons. After 3 h serum concentration reached 36 ng/ml which is 
three times higher than previously reported for intoxications in humans29. However, it is important to note that 
dose conversion always requires some consideration, because human bioavailability and metabolism may differ 
significantly from that of animals. Furthermore, differences between human and animal receptor sensitivity or 
density have been shown to affect human pharmacologic or toxicologic outcomes30. In general, number of studies 
on JWH-018 pharmacokinetics are limited and sample sizes with equal conditions are small, which makes the 
comparison of the different studies difficult. Another point is the different route of administration, and it is possi-
ble that inhalation might have a faster pharmacokinetic effect than intraperitoneal injection.
The activity of metabolites of JWH-018 is unknown, but may be important because such metabolites may 
exert synergistic effects and reinforce the SCs toxicity. Among them, the JWH-018 N-(4-OH) metabolite exhib-
ited the highest concentration and mimicked the time/concentration curve of JWH-018. Interestingly, in humans, 
the JWH-018-N-pentanoic acid metabolite usually demonstrates the highest concentration28 among metabolites, 
while our data showed the concentration slowly beginning to rise after 15 min. This may reflect a species differ-
ence for JWH-018 metabolism, and thus potentially indicate different toxicity. This increase of concentration 
could partially explain the long-term electrographic and behavioral changes after JWH-018 administration in

mice. To answer these questions, further studies on JWH-018 metabolites and their toxicity need to be conducted 
in mice.
Both ∆9-THC and JWH-018 induced breathing alterations and profound catatonia, which are consistent 
with previous reports31. At the same time, JWH-018 produced severe adverse neurological effects with durations 
longer than ∆9-THC, including extensor hind limb rigidity, muscular jerks, rearing, and behavioral seizures; this 
longer duration and severity may be attributable to differences in blood-brain permeability or intracerebral distri-
bution of these compounds12, 13. CB1Rs are expressed in both excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic 
terminals; therefore, the distribution of CB1R-expressing activated neurons may play a key role in generating 
different behavioral and neurophysiological effects32.
Our results clearly show that the epileptogenic properties of cannabinoids are mediated via CB1 receptors. 
Therefore, pure CB1R agonism, or high affinity to CB1Rs carries a high risk to induce seizures. The greatest danger 
therefore for accidental overdoses seems to stem from SCs with high CB1R affinity. These substances are often not 
controlled, since they are newly synthesized and therefore not yet banned by regulatory agencies. This may lead 
users to falsely believe that they are safe for consumption. Combined with unknown doses and affinities, users 
may easily subject themselves to accidental overdose. Patients that present to emergency rooms with a history 
of SC abuse should be carefully monitored for epileptic events using EEG recordings. Particularly since their 
symptoms might be misinterpreted as simple sedation, stupor or catatonia33, 34. Use of plant-derived cannabinoids 
seems less risky, since their potency might be lower and anti-epileptogenic compounds may counterbalance the 
epilepsy risk posed by CB1R agonism. Nevertheless these cannabinoids, if overdosed, can lead to epileptic sei-
zures, as we show here. Thus, the same vigilance as for SCs seems prudent, if overdose is suspected. Controlled 
medical use of cannabinoids seems to carry the smallest risk. Doses are typically significantly lower than used 
in our studies to elicit seizures. It should be noted, however that epileptic seizures as rare adverse side effects of 
medical marijuana use have been reported35.
The CB1R agonists we have studied revealed strong proconvulsive properties, implying that any newly syn-
thesized CB1R agonists may also exert similar behavioral effects and trigger seizures. Seizures require immediate 
treatment because they can be life-threatening and/or disabling. No specific medication is currently available 
to alleviate cannabinoid intoxication. The mechanism of toxicity to explain the seizures induced by cannabi-
noids remains unclear. Coupled with increased public use, constant production of new analogues and our lack 
of knowledge as to their long-term effects on human health show the need for further research and proper regu-
lation. Finally, the potential introduction of CB1R antagonists, as a treatment for cannabinoid-induced seizures 
or other life-threatening conditions in the case of overdose, requires further investigation in the clinical settings.
Methods
Animals. 
All experiments were conducted using adult male C57BL/6J mice at the age of 10–14 weeks, 
obtained from Charles River (Kanagawa, Japan). All described experiments were replicated at least twice. Mice 
were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment and maintained on a 12-h light: 12-h dark 
cycle (lights on at 07:00). Food and water were available ad libitum. Experiments were performed in compliance 
with relevant Japanese and institutional laws and guidelines and approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the 
University of Tsukuba, number 16–086. Efforts were made to reduce the number of animals used and to minimize 
any pain or discomfort they might have felt.
EEG/EMG implantation surgery. 
Under anaesthesia with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.), mice were placed 
on an animal stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA), after which custom-made EEG 
and EMG electrodes were implanted aseptically. EEG electrode screws were placed epidurally on the right frontal 
and parietal cortices (AP, +1 mm to the front of bregma or lambda; LR −
1.5 mm lateral from the sagittal raphe) 
according to the mouse brain atlas of Franklin and Paxinos36. EMG signals were recorded from two insulated 
Teflon-coated electrodes that had been inserted into the bilateral neck muscles. Finally, the electrode assembly 
was fixed to the skull with self-curing dental cement, and the wound was then sutured. After surgery, the animals 
were administered an i.p. injection of ampicillin (100 mg/kg) and allowed to recover in individual housing cages 
for one week. Each animal was then connected to an EEG/EMG recording cable, with acclimation in an individ-
ual sound-proof recording chamber for an additional three days. Each cable was flexible so that the mice could 
move freely about their cages.
Video, EEG, EMG and LMA polygraphic recording and analysis. 
Cortical EEG and EMG signals 
were amplified, filtered (EEG, 0.5–35 Hz; EMG, 20–200 Hz) and digitized at a 128-Hz sampling rate. The signals 
were recorded by using Vital Recorder software (Kissei Comtec, Nagano, Japan) and analysed with Sleepsign 
software (Kissei Comtec) as previously described37. A passive infrared sensor was placed on each animal’s cage to 
detect movement of the subject. A video of each animal was recorded using an infrared camera.
Video behavioral assessment and quantification. 
To characterize each animal’s condition and behav-
ior more precisely, we performed video recording together with live EEG monitoring using a video camera 
(Panasonic HC-WX990 M) in the double-screen mode. Severity of typical seizure symptoms was assessed by 
Racine’s scale38 with modifications: 0 - no behavioral change; 1 - immobility and behavioral arrest; 2 - isolated 
body jerks; 3 - rearing and tonic extension of forelimbs and hind limbs, occasional clonus.
Seizure-spike quantification. 
Seizure spikes were detected and counted using peak analysis function of 
OriginLab v8.5 Pro software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA). A threshold from 40 to 50% was set to restrict 
quantification to high-amplitude spikes only.

Drugs. 
Δ
9-THC was provided by Dr. S. Morimoto (Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, 
Japan) and stored in ethanol at −
80 °C. JWH-018, metabolites of JWH-018, deuterium-labelled JWH-018 (JWH-
018-d9) and AM-251 were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and stored at −
20 °C. The 
doses of cannabinoids presently used here were selected based on the CB1R affinity of the ligands and the electro-
graphic representation of mild seizure events. In fact, we intentionally selected relatively high doses that we knew 
to have an effect on EEG power spectra39. The conversion of an animal to human dose cannot be done directly, as 
in the few available studies on human volunteers most utilize the inhalation route, while we administered drugs 
intraperitoneally. However, after applying the human estimation dose conversion40, 2.5 mg/kg of JWH-018 in 
mouse corresponds to 0.2 mg/kg, or roughly 12 mg per person. Similarly, 10 mg/kg of ∆9-THC in mice converts 
to 0.8 mg/kg in humans or about 49 mg per individual.
Drug administration. 
All chemicals were dissolved in a mixture of 5% dimethylsulfoxide, 5% emulphor 
(EL-620, a polyoxyethylated vegetable oil; GAF Corporation, Linden, NJ, USA), and 90% saline (0.9% NaCl). 
Drug solutions were prepared immediately before use and administered intraperitoneally 1 h after dark onset. 
Each animal received a vehicle injection, which served as a control; the cannabinoid (Δ
9-THC or JWH-018) was 
then injected the following day. AM251 was injected 30 min before JWH-018 administration.
Measurement of serum JWH-018 and metabolites using liquid chromatography–coupled to 
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). 
Blood was collected in Terumo Capiject Capillary Blood 
Collection Tubes (Tokyo, Japan) and, after centrifugation serum was transferred into plastic tubes. JWH-018-d9 
was added as an internal standard (IS) to each serum sample, and the samples were filtrated using Captiva NDLipids 
(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Partially purified samples were injected into the I-Class/Xebo TQS LC–MS/
MS system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) equipped with an electrospray interface and operated in the positive 
ion mode. A Coretecs C18 column (2.7 μ
m, 2.1 mm i.d. ×
150 mm; Waters) together with a mobile phase con-
sisting of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid/water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid/acetonitrile (solvent B) was used for LC 
separation. Quantification of JWH-018 and six metabolites was performed using multiple reaction monitoring 
(MRM) of the transitions of precursor ions to product ions with each cone voltage and collision energy as shown 
in Table 1. During the analyses, we confirmed two transitions (precursor ions and two product ions of each 
compound) and their ratio. The drug concentrations in the samples were calculated using the peak–area ratios 
of the product ions for quantitative monitored for the target compounds versus IS. The calibration curves for the 
determination were constructed by analysing extracted drug-free control serum spiked with the standard solu-
tion. The limit of quantitation of each drug was chosen to be the concentration of the lowest calibration standard 
with an acceptable limit of variance, while the limit of detection was defined as concentration in a sample matrix 
resulting in peak areas with signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of 3. Calibration curves of JWH-018 and the metabolites 
were linear over the concentration range 0.2–400 ng/ml for JWH-018 and 0.2–40 ng/ml for the metabolites with 
good correlation coefficients of r2 ≥
 0.995, respectively. The limit of detection of each drug was 0.02 ng/ml.
Group assignment. 
All animals were littermates and were assigned randomly to different groups. EEG anal-
ysis and spike quantification were performed by an experimenter who was unaware of the group to which the 
animal belonged.
Sample size. 
Power analysis was used to determine the ideal sample size for behavioral experiments. 
Assuming a normal distribution, a 20% change in mean and 15% variation, we estimated that six mice would 
be required per group. In some cases, mice were excluded from analysis due to damage to or loss of the EEG 
electrode.

Statistical analysis. 
Data are presented as individual mean ± s.e.m. for groups, where n = 6, with the excep-
tion of the metabolite analysis, where n = 3. Group comparison was done using the unpaired two-tailed t-test; and 
in all cases, p ≤
 0.05 was considered significant. For dose-dependent experiments one-way ANOVA followed by 
LSD post-hoc analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0 software (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY, USA).
The data sets generated and analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on 
reasonable request.
