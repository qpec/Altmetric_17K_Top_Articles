Abstract
Although clinical and basic studies show that parental trauma, fear and anxiety may be transmitted 
to offspring, the neurobiology of this transmission is still not well understood. We recently 
demonstrated in an animal model that infant rats acquire threat responses to a distinct cue if a 
mother expresses fear to this cue in their presence. This ability to acquire maternal fear through 
social learning is present at birth and, as we previously reported, depends on the pup's amygdala. 
However, the remaining neural mechanisms underlying social fear learning in infancy remain 
elusive. Here, using 14C 2-deoxyglucose autoradiography, we show that the mother-to-infant 
transmission of fear in preweaning rats is associated with a significant increase of activity in the 
subregions of the lateral septum, nucleus accumbens, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, retrosplenial 
cortex, paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, mediodorsal and intralaminar thalamic nuclei, 
medial and lateral preoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus, and the lateral periaqueductal gray. In 
contrast to studies of adult social fear learning demonstrating the role of the anterior cingulate 
cortex and possibly the insular cortex, or research of infant classical fear conditioning showing the 
role of the posterior piriform cortex, no changes of activation in these areas were observed. Our 
results indicate that the pup's exposure to maternal fear activates a number of areas involved in 
processing threat, stress or pain. This pattern of activation suggests a unique set of neural 
mechanisms underlying social fear learning in the developing brain.

 Exposure to mother expressing fear in response to the previously conditioned stimulus (CS) odor 
activates a number of pain, stress and fear processing areas in the brain of the infant rat and 
produces fear responses to this odor that last at least until the post-weaning period.
Clinical studies report that emotional trauma and fear may be transmitted across generations 
(Yehuda et al., 2005; Murray et al., 2008; Roberts et al., 2012; Eley et al., 2015). Parental 
history of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increases the child's risk of developing 
PTSD (Roberts et al., 2012), whereas parental diagnosis of a specific phobia increases the 
occurrence of phobia in the offspring (Murray et al., 2008; Lara et al., 2012). One of the 
features shared by PTSD and specific phobias is a presence of distinct, trauma- (as in PTSD) 
or phobia-related cues that trigger threat responses. Intergenerational transmission of stress, 
fear and anxiety may be explained by a wide range of mechanisms, including genetic and 
epigenetic mechanisms, environmental factors, or gene environment interactions (Bowers 
and Yehuda, 2016). Recent studies suggest that parental modeling, such as a display of 
anxious behaviors in the child's presence and the children's ability to learn these behaviors 
from parents are major ways of the intergenerational transmission of fear and anxiety (de 
Rosnay et al., 2008; Aktar et al., 2013; Eley et al., 2015). Although existing research sheds 
some light on the biological basis of intergenerational transfer of nonspecific stress and 
anxiety (Klengel et al., 2015), little is known about the mechanisms controlling 
intergenerational social transmission of specific threat responses. To study neural 
mechanisms of the intergenerational social transmission of fear we used a social fear 
learning (SFL) paradigm.
Social fear learning, also referred to as vicarious fear learning, is a behavioral tool well 
suited for investigating mechanisms of intergenerational transmission of threat responses 
triggered by distinct cues, such as in PTSD and phobias (Olsson and Phelps, 2007). In SFL, 
an animal acquires fear responses to a neutral cue through exposure to a conspecific 
expressing fear to this cue. SFL is thus a form of associative fear learning in which a 
classical noxious unconditioned stimulus (Debiec et al., 2010) is replaced with an expression 
of fear by a conspecific animal. Although SFL has been shown by a number of studies 
across animal species, including humans (Mineka & Cook, 1993; Knapska et al., 2006; 
Jones et al., 2014; Molapour et al., 2015), the neural mechanisms of SFL remain to be 
elucidated. Research suggests that SFL and classical fear conditioning share similar neural

 mechanisms, e.g. studies in adult humans and rodents show that both SFL and classical fear 
conditioning engage the amygdala, the hippocampus, the affective pain processing systems, 
including the midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei (MITN), the anterior cingulate cortex 
(ACC), and the midbrain structures, such as the periaqueductal gray subdivisons, which are 
directly involved in controlling threat responses (Olsson et al., 2007; Jeon et al., 2010; 
Molapour et al., 2015). Despite the growing number of studies of SFL in adults, little is 
known about the mechanisms of social transmission of fear in infancy.
We recently reported that infant rats can acquire fear responses from their mother through 
SFL (Debiec and Sullivan, 2014). This mother-to-infant fear transmission was mediated by 
alarm chemosignaling and depended on the pup's amygdala (Debiec and Sullivan, 2014). 
Specifically, we found that the acquisition of SFL in preweaning rats was accompanied by 
increased activity in the lateral, basal, central, medial and cortical nuclei of the amygdala, 
and that a pharmacological inactivation of the lateral nucleus of the amygdala prevented the 
acquisition of SFL (Debiec and Sullivan, 2014). Although in our previous study we observed 
that SFL occurs at the end of the first week of life (Debiec and Sullivan, 2014), it is still to 
be determined whether rats are born with the ability to acquire specific threat responses 
through social learning. We hypothesize that SFL mechanisms in pups are functional at 
birth. Also, the involvement of neural sites, other than the amygdala, in early SFL needs to 
be characterized. Previous fear conditioning studies in rodents show the key role of the 
olfactory processing areas, such as the posterior pririform cortex (PPir) (e.g. Raineki et al., 
2009), yet, the role of the PPir in SFL has not been determined. Also, it is unlikely that the 
hippocampus or the neocortical structures, such as the ACC, which contribute to the 
formation of fear memories in adults (Toyoda et al., 2011), are involved in the infant SFL, 
since they are not fully functional until after weaning (Rudy, 1993; Raineki et al., 2010). We 
hypothesize that SFL in infancy occurs without the involvement of the hippocampus or 
neocortical structures. In this study we address the two questions raised above: whether SFL 
is present at birth and what extra-amygdala structures are potentially involved in SFL in 
infancy. We show that SFL occurs on the day of birth suggesting that pups are born with the 
ability to acquire SFL. To assess neural sites activated during infant SFL we used the 14C 2-
deoxyglucose (2-DG) autoradiograms obtained during the previously described experiment 
(Debiec and Sullivan, 2014). 2-DG autoradiography is a method allowing the assessment of 
activity by measuring the activity-dependent uptake of the radiographic marker. 2-DG has 
been especially useful in the whole-brain analysis of neural activity in rodent pups (Sullivan 
et al., 2000; Raineki et al., 2009; Marquez et al., 2013). Using 2-DG autoradiography, we 
identify several neural structures activated in the pup's brain during the mother-to-infant 
transmission of fear through social learning.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Animals were male and female Long–Evans rats born and bred in our colony (originally 
acquired from Harlan Laboratories). Mothers or ‘substitute mothers’ were multiparous 
females. Animals were housed in polypropylene cages (34 × 29 × 17 cm) with an abundant 
amount of wood shavings for nest building. Rats were kept in a 20 ± 1°C environment with a

 12 h light/dark cycle. Food and water were provided ad libitum. To prevent litter effects on 
statistical analysis, no more than one female and one male from a litter was used in each 
experimental condition. All animal care and experimental procedures were in accordance 
with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of experimental 
animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Fear conditioning of mothers
Maternal olfactory fear conditioning took place in a conditioning chamber constructed of 
aluminum and Plexiglas walls (Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, Pennsylvania) with a 
metal stainless steel rod flooring that was attached to a shock generator (Model H13-15; 
Coulbourn Instruments). The chamber was enclosed within an acoustic-isolation ventilated 
cubicle (Model H10-24A; Coulbourn Instruments). Stimuli presentations were controlled by 
Freezeframe and behavior was recorded. Conditioned stimulus (CS) odor (pure peppermint, 
McCormick, Hunt Valley, Maryland;) was delivered by a flow dilution olfactometer 
controlled by a ChronTrol (ChonTrol Corporation, San Diego, California), at a 2 L/min flow 
rate and at a concentration of 1:10 peppermint vapor. The unconditioned stimulus (US) was 
a 0.5-s (0.6-mA) electric foot shock delivered through a grid floor. In this study, we used a 
“substitute mother” procedure. “Substitute mothers” were dams matched with pups’ mothers 
for postpartum period and diet. Previous studies have shown that mothers accept all pups 
and pups fail to distinguish between their mother and a substitute mother matched for the 
same postpartum period and the same diet (Moriceau and Sullivan, 2006; Debiec and 
Sullivan, 2014). “Substitute mothers” were conditioned during the lactation period. Animals 
were placed in the conditioning chamber, and given a 10-minute acclimation period. 
Conditioning consisted of 6 conditioning trials using a 30-second CS odor which co-
terminated with a US shock (the inter trial interval, ITI, was randomly generated and was 4 
minutes on average). “Unfrightened mothers” were dams that did not receive fear 
conditioning but instead were exposed to the equivalent number of the CS odor presentations 
(Fig. 1) or the equivalent number of unpaired CSs and USs (Fig. 2), and did not express fear 
during a subsequent re-exposure to the CS in the pups’ presence (Tab. 1; Debiec and 
Sullivan, 2014).
Mother-to-infant social transmission of fear
Exposure of pups and mothers to the CS took place in the home cage on postnatal day (PN) 
0 (Fig. 1) or PN 13-14 (Fig. 2). For the duration of the experiment, a biological mother was 
replaced in the home cage with a “substitute mother”. The biological mother then remained 
in the colony in the new home cage, whereas pups in the cage with the “substitute mother” 
were moved to the experimental room. Animals were given a 1 hour adaptation period after 
which all mothers were settled and were nursing the litter. The 4, 30s CS odor presentations 
were delivered by an olfactometer (concentration of 1:10 peppermint vapor; 2 L/min flow 
rate) to mother and pups with a 10 min ITI. Immediately after, pups were removed from the 
cage with a ‘substitute mother’ and returned to the colony room and were placed in the home 
cage with their mother.

 Fear memory test
On PN 9 or PN 22, pups were individually placed in a 600-mL clear plastic beaker and given 
a 2 min adaptation period. Subsequently, pups received three presentations of a peppermint 
CS odor (30 s) delivered by an olfactometer (concentration of 1:10 peppermint vapor; 2 
L/min flow rate) with a 4-min ITI. After the completion of the experiment, pups were 
returned to the dam. The freezing behavior was videotaped and scored by a blind observer. 
An average of the three scores for each CS for each pup was used for the statistical analysis. 
Behavior was displayed as percent of freezing during the CS exposure.
Assessment of neural correlates using autoradiography
For the assessment of neural activity we used autoradiograms obtained in the previously 
reported experiment (Debiec and Sullivan, 2014). PN 13-14 pups were injected with 14C 2-
deoxyglucose (2-DG) (20 μCi/100 g, s.c.) 5 min before the mother-to-infant social 
transmission of fear procedure (see above). Immediately after the social transmission of fear 
procedure, pups were euthanized, and their brains were quickly removed, frozen in 2-
methylbutane (−45°C), and stored in a −70°C freezer. Subsequently, brains were sectioned 
(20 μm) in a −20°C cryostat, and every other section was placed on a coverslip and exposed 
for 5 d along with standards (14C standards 10 × 0.02 mCi; American Radiolabeled 
Chemicals) to x-ray film. 2-DG uptake was assessed using ImageJ software (NIH). The 
uptake of 2-DG was expressed relative to uptake in the corpus callosum (CC). 2-DG uptake 
in the CC did not vary across conditions. 2-DG uptake was measured by an observer blind to 
the experimental condition. For image analysis a default grey scale was used. For a better 
display, the images shown in Figure 2 were converted to pseudocolor using the ImageJ 
Green/Red Lookup Table (see: Fig. 2 legend).
Data analysis
Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, 
CA) using the t-test. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05.
RESULTS
Mother-to-Infant Social Transfer of Fear Occurs on the Day of Birth
PN 0 pups exposed to a mother expressing fear to the previously trained CS odor (“Exposure 
to Frightened Mother”; n = 6), as well as pups exposed to a mother that was not frightened 
(“Exposure to Unfrightened Mother”; n = 6), showed negligible levels of freezing behavior 
prior to the presentation of the same CS odor on PN 9 (percent of freezing behavior during a 
1 min. time interval prior to the presentation of the first CS for the “Exposure to Frightened 
Mother” group was 3.89 ± 2.36 and for the “Exposure to Unfrightened Mother” group was: 
2.59 ± 0.88, respectively;, P > 0.05). However, during subsequent presentations of the CS 
odor “Exposure to Frightened Mother” pups displayed significantly higher levels of freezing 
behavior as compared to the “Exposure to Unfrightened Mother” controls (Student t-test, P 
< 0.01) (Fig. 1B; for maternal behavior during the CS odor re-exposure see: Tab. 1). Testing 
on PN 22 of another group of pups that had been exposed on PN 0 to a mother frightened by 
a presentation of the previously conditioned CS odor (“Exposure to Frightened Mother”; n =

 9) as compared to pups exposed to a mother which had not been frightened (“Exposure to 
Unfrightened Mother”; n = 9) revealed that pups with a history of exposure to a frightened 
mother on PN 0 expressed significantly higher levels of freezing behavior while presented 
with the same CS odor (Student t-test, P < 0.05; Fig. 1C).
Brain Autoradiography of Mother-to-Infant Social Transfer of Fear
The analysis of the 2-DG autoradiograms results using t-test shows that PN 13-14 pups 
exposed to a frightened mother (“Exposure to Frightened Mother”; n = 7) as compared to 
pups exposed to an unfrightened mother (“Exposure to Unfrightened Mother”; n = 6) display 
significant increase in neural activity in several sites, including the nucleus accumbens core 
(AcbC) (P < 0.05), nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) (P < 0.05), lateral septum portions: 
dorsal (LSD) (P < 0.001), lateral (LSL) (P < 0.001) and ventral (LSV) (P < 0.05), bed 
nucleus of stria terminalis parts: anterodorsal (adBNST) (P < 0.05) ventral (vBNST) (P < 
0.05) and the oval nucleus (ovBNST) (P < 0.05), retrosplenial cortex (RSC) (P < 0.01), 
hypothalamic nuclei: medial preoptic (MPO) (P < 0.01), lateral preoptic (LPO) (P < 0.01) 
and paraventricular (PVN) (P < 0.05), thalamic nuclei: paraventricular (PVT) (P < 0.05) and 
mediodorsal / intralaminar (MITN) (P < 0.05), and the lateral portion of the periaqueductal 
gray (lPAG) (P < 0.05). No significant differences between the experimental groups (P > 
0.05) were observed in the prelimbic cortex (PL), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insular 
cortex (IC), anterior piriform cortex (APir), posterior piriform cortex (PPir), dorsal 
hippocampus, ventral hippocampus, primary auditory cortex (Au1), ventral posterolateral 
(VPN) and ventral posteromedial (VPM) nuclei of the thalamus, medial geniculate nucleus 
of the thalamus (MG), ventrolateral or dorsomedial periaqueductal gray (vlPAG and 
dmPAG, respectively). The complete list of examined structures with corresponding results 
is presented in Tab. 2.; Fig. 2 includes representative autoradiography images from selected 
areas showing significant increase of neural activity during the exposure to a frightened 
mother.
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we showed that PN 0 pups may acquire maternal CS-specific threat 
responses through social fear learning (Fig. 1). Maternal expression of fear to the CS in the 
newborns’ presence (Tab. 1) was sufficient to produce CS-controlled freezing responses that 
persisted at least until after weaning on PN 22 (Fig. 1). These results are consistent with our 
previous findings showing that pups during the first postnatal week may acquire from their 
mother long lasting CS-specific threat responses (Debiec and Sullivan, 2014). The current 
study extends our earlier findings and suggests that pups are born with an ability to learn 
about threats through social learning. This is in stark contrast with studies on classical fear 
conditioning which demonstrate that until PN 10 electric shock-reinforced aversive learning 
is physiologically attenuated (Sullivan et al., 2000). The present study, together with our 
previous work (Debiec and Sullivan, 2014), points at unique role of maternally transmitted 
emotional learning which enables infants to develop defense responses against possible 
environmental threats when they are still with the mother in the nest, and before they are 
able to learn through their own harmful experiences, such as these occurring in fear 
conditioning. However, given the small sample size, the interpretation of these data is

 limited and future research with a larger sample size should substantiate our current 
findings.
Most of what we know about the neural mechanisms of social fear learning comes from 
studies of adult organisms. We previously showed that transfer of maternal fear responses in 
infancy through SFL is mediated by alarm chemosignaling and depends on the pup's 
amygdala (Debiec and Sullivan, 2014). A surgical disruption of alarm pheromone processing 
pathways or pharmacological inactivation of the amygdala in preweaning pups prevented 
social transmission of fear using alarm pheromone (an odor of the frightened mother). 
However, both alarm chemosignaling and amygdala-dependent fear learning, including 
social fear learning, engage a number of neural sites and systems (Kiyokawa et al., 2005; 
Herry and Johansen, 2014). Our experiment using 2-DG autoradiography allowed 
identification of several extra-amygdala sites in the pup's brain that were activated by the 
maternal expression of fear (Tab. 2; Fig. 2).
Neural Activity in the Cortex and the Hippocampus
Previous research has identified several neural sites in the forebrain subserving fear learning. 
A recent study reported that pharmacological inactivation of the ACC in adult mice 
prevented the acquisition of social fear learning suggesting that the ACC plays a critical role 
in SFL (Jeon et al., 2010). In accordance with this report, a functional imaging study in adult 
human subjects showed activation in the ACC during a social fear learning task (Olsson et 
al., 2007). The same study reported increased activity in the IC during SFL. Indeed, 
evidence from human and rodent research suggests that the ACC and IC play a role in 
assessing potential threats (Fiddick, 2010). Another neocortical structure known to be 
involved in the acquisition and expression of classical fear conditioning in the adults is the 
PL (Sotres-Bayon et al., 2012; Sharpe and Killcross, 2015). However, in our study we did 
not observe any changes of activity in the pup's ACC, IC or PL during the mother-to-infant 
social transmission of fear (Tab. 2). It is likely that SFL in preweaning pups occurs 
independently of the neocortical structures, ACC, IC or PL, since mature cerebral 
metabolism emerges in rats around PN 20 and maturation of the neocortex is completed 
around PN 90 (Watson et al., 2006). Similarly, an acquisition of maternal fear responses was 
not accompanied by an increased 2-DG uptake in the pup's primary auditory cortex or 
hippocampus (Tab. 2). Although, the hippocampus and the auditory cortex play important 
roles in adult fear conditioning (context fear conditioning and auditory fear conditioning, 
respectively), the auditory modality is not functional until the postnatal week 3 and the 
hippocampus-dependent aversive learning emerges around / after weaning at PN 21 (Rudy, 
1993; Raineki et al., 2010). However, we did observe increased 2-DG uptake in the RSC 
(Tab. 2; Fig. 2) which was shown to be involved in context fear conditioning in adults 
(Kwapis et al., 2015), yet its role in other forms of fear learning is not so well understood 
(Tab. 2; Fig. 2E).
Research on olfactory learning in preweaning pups indicates the involvement of the piriform 
cortex (part of the olfactory cortex), with the APir being implicated in the odor preference 
learning (Roth and Sullivan, 2005; Raineki et al., 2009; Morrison et al., 2013), and the PPir 
in the odor aversive learning (Raineki et al., 2009). Our published study indicates that a

 Grueneberg ganglion (GG) olfactory subsystem that processes alarm chemosignaling is 
involved in pups in the mother-to-infant social transmission of fear (Debiec and Sullivan, 
2014). However, in the current study, an exposure to a frightened mother did not produce 
any changes in the activity of the APir or PPir (Tab. 2). Although, earlier research suggests 
that classical fear conditioning and SFL share similar neural mechanisms (Olsson and 
Phelps, 2007), the observed lack of activation in the PPir suggests that olfaction-mediated 
infant social fear learning is controlled by neural systems, at least in part, distinct from the 
classical olfactory aversive learning mechanisms. The lack of activation in the hippocampus, 
the PL, IC or the ACC, which are all involved in aversive learning in adults, also points at 
the distinct neural mechanisms supporting SFL in infancy.
Neural Activity in the Lateral Septum
We found that exposure to a frightened mother is accompanied by increased 2-DG uptake in 
the LSD, LSL and LSV (Tab. 2; Fig 2B). Lateral septum (LS) nuclei are reciprocally 
connected with the main olfactory bulb, cingulate cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, 
hypothalamus, thalamus and midbrain areas, and have been shown by previous research to 
be involved in the affect regulation (Sheehan et al., 2004). Specifically, studies in rodents 
show that the lateral septum plays an important role in the social modulation of fear 
(Guzman et al., 2014; Zoicas et al., 2014). Our findings show the activation of the LS during 
SFL, however, the possible role of the LS in the mother infant transmission of fear has to be 
determined by further research.
Neural Activity in the Nucleus Accumbens and the Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis
We previously demonstrated that early SFL is associated with activation of several amygdala 
nuclei (Debiec and Sullivan, 2014). Here we assessed neural activation in the extended 
amygdala areas, including the nucleus accumbens shell and stria terminalis subregions. It is 
well known that the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) plays an important role in stress, 
fear and anxiety (Daniel and Rainnie, 2015). We found that mother-to-infant social 
transmission of fear was associated with increased 2-DG uptake in the BNST subregions: 
adBNST, ovBNST and vBNST (Tab. 2; Fig 2C). This is consistent with a recent study 
showing that an exposure to alarm pheromone induces expression of the early expression 
gene c-Fos in the BNST in adult rats (Kiyokawa et al, 2005). Our data show that early SFL 
is accompanied by increased activity in the AcbC and AcbSh (Tab. 2; Fig 2A). Although, the 
role of the nucleus accumbens (Acb) in fear learning is not so well understood, recent 
studies in adult rats show that inactivation of the Acb disrupts the acquisition of fear-
potentiated startle (Schwienbacher et al., 2004) and that active avoidance of threat is 
associated with increased neural activity in the Acb, especially in the AcbSh (Ramirez et al., 
2015). We found that infant SFL is associated with increased activity in the BNST and the 
Acb subregions. Recent studies highlight the role of the BNST and the Acb systems in 
controlling fear and anxiety states (Daniel and Rainnie, 2015; Ramirez et al., 2015). Our 
findings suggest that the BNST and the Acb systems may be involved in social learning in 
infancy.

 Neural Activity in the Hypothalamus
It is well established that hypothalamic structures are involved in processing fear, stress and 
pain (Gross and Canteras, 2012). We found that early SFL increased 2-DG uptake in the 
hypothalamic nuclei: MPO, LPO and PVN (Tab. 2; Fig 2). Although, the role of the 
hypothalamus in SFL is unknown, several hypothalamic structures are critical parts of a 
defensive circuitry and control social or predator fear (Gross and Canteras, 2012). A recent 
study showed that social defeat stress task in adult rats increased c-Fos immunoreactivity in 
MPO, LPO and PVN (Lkhagvasuren et al., 2014). In addition, increased c-Fos expression 
was observed in the LPO and PVN during predator exposure in adult mice (Martinez et al., 
2008). Increased activity in the MPO, LPO and PVN during an exposure to a frightened 
mother suggests that these hypothalamic nuclei may be a part of neural networks supporting 
SFL in infancy.
Neural Activity in the Thalamus
Previous research has shown that the MITN, which are a thalamic part of the affective pain 
processing system, are involved in SFL in adult mice (Jeon et al., 2009). Consistent with this 
finding, we observed that mother-to-infant social transmission of fear was accompanied by 
increased 2-DG uptake in the MITN (Tab. 2). However, we did find any augmentation of 
neural activity during SFL in other hypothalamic pain systems, the VPN and VPM (Gauriau 
and Bernard, 2002). Our 2-DG analysis showed that infant SFL was accompanied by the 
PVT activation (Tab. 2; Fig 2F). The PVT is vastly connected with the Acc, BNST and the 
amygdala, and there is increasing evidence coming from adult studies showing the role of 
the PVT in regulating fear and anxiety (Kirouac, 2015). The role of the PVT in infant fear is 
yet to be determined. Although, the auditory thalamus plays a key role in adult auditory fear 
conditioning (Apergis-Schoute et al., 2005), consistent with previous studies showing that 
auditory modality is not functional until the postnatal week 3 (Rudy, 1993), we did not 
observe any activation in the auditory thalamus (MG) during infant SFL (Tab. 2). In 
accordance with adult SFL findings, our data suggest that the thalamus is a part of the social 
transmission of fear circuitry in infancy.
Neural Activity in the Periaqueductal Gray
It is well known that the periaqueductal gray (PAG) is a part of pain and fear processing 
systems, and through its connections with the amygdala is an important part of classical fear 
conditioning circuitry (Herry and Johansen, 2014). However, the role of the PAG in SFL has 
not yet been studied. We found that mother to infant social transmission of fear was 
associated with increased neural activity in the lPAG but not dmPAG or vlPAG (Tab. 2; Fig 
2G), although all these parts of the PAG are involved in classical fear conditioning in adults. 
Our findings suggest that the PAG nociceptive and fear processing circuits may play a role in 
the infant SFL, as they do in classical fear conditioning in adults. The fact that SFL, as 
compared to fear conditioning, is associated with the more selective activation of the PAG 
(activation of the lPAG but no activation of the dmPAG or vlPAG) suggests that the plausible 
involvement of the periaqeductal gray in controlling socially transmitted fear is distinct from 
its role in fear conditioning.

 Summary and Conclusions
Children are very vulnerable to parental stress, fear and trauma. The impact of maternal 
stress on the child's behavior and emotion regulation can been observed as early as in 
infancy (Bosquet Enlow et al., 2011). The effects of parental stress and fear on the offspring 
are mediated by hereditary, genetic or non genetic, as well as non-hereditary mechanisms, 
such as social learning. Although the ability to acquire social fear learning is present across 
the lifespan, the young child's dependence on the caregiver and the distinctive sensitivity to 
the caregiver's emotions determine a special role of social fear learning in infancy and early 
childhood. This unique character of SFL in childhood allows the offspring to learn early 
from parents about possible threats in the surrounding world (Debiec and Sullivan, 2014). 
Our data indicate the unique nature of social fear learning which is present at birth, in 
contrast to classical fear conditioning that emerges in pups during the second week of life. 
Infant rats can thus learn from the mother about environmental threats before their sensory 
and motor development allows them to acquire aversive learning through their own 
interactions with the environment outside their nest. However, the same ability to develop 
adaptive threat responses in conjunction with exposures to parental maladaptive fear may 
mediate the parent-child transmission of disordered fear and anxiety. Indeed, a recently 
published study of children-of-twins shows that children may acquire maladaptive anxiety 
from their parents through social fear learning, independently of hereditary mechanisms 
(Eley et al., 2015). Characterization of the mechanisms of SFL in infancy and early 
childhood is thus critical for the understanding of the social transmission of adaptive and 
maladaptive fears.
We previously demonstrated that the amygdala plays a critical role in social transmission of 
fear in infancy (Debiec and Sullivan, 2014). Here, we show that several neural sites which 
are involved in processing fear, stress and pain, and which, in major part, are either directly 
or indirectly connected with the amygdala, are activated in the pup's brain during the 
acquisition of maternal threat responses. The current study provides candidate regions for 
further research of neural mechanisms of social fear learning in humans. Identification of the 
behavioral, neural and molecular mechanisms of social fear learning in infancy and early 
childhood may help develop early preventive and treatment interventions aimed at disrupting 
the transfer of parental maladaptive fears to children.

 SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
Children learn adaptive and maladaptive anxious behaviors from their parents. However, 
neural mechanisms of this parent-child fear transmission remain elusive. Here, using a 
rodent model of mother-to-infant social transmission of fear and autoradiography 
imaging, we identify a number of threat and stress processing areas in the infant brain 
activated by an exposure to a frightened mother. Understanding the neurobiology of the 
parent-child fear transmission will contribute to the development of novel methods aimed 
at prevention and treatment of the intergenerational transmission of maladaptive fear, 
stress and trauma.

Mother-to-infant social transfer of fear on the day of birth. A: Schematic diagram illustrating 
behavioral procedures used in the mother-to-infant transmission of fear experiment. 
Postnatal day (PN) 0 pups were exposed to mother previously fear conditioned and re-
exposed to the conditioned stimulus (CS) in pups presence (“Exposure to Frightened 
Mother”). Another group of PN 0 pups were exposed to mother with prior exposure to the 
CS alone (without the unconditioned stimulus, US) and then re exposed to this CS while 
with the pups (“Exposure to Unfrightened Mother”). A part of animals from each 
experimental group was re-exposed to the odor that served as the CS in maternal fear 
conditioning on PN 9, whereas the other part was re-exposed to the same CS on PN 22. B: 
PN 0 pups from the “Exposure to Frightened Mother” group show significantly higher levels 
of freezing behavior upon CS presentation than the “Exposure to Unfrightened Mother” 
pups on PN 9 (n = 6 for each group). C: PN 0 pups from the “Exposure to Frightened 
Mother” group show significantly higher levels of freezing behavior upon CS presentation 
than the “Exposure to Unfrightened Mother” pups on PN 22 (n = 9 for each group). All bars 
indicate mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
