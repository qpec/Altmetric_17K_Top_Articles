Introduction
Since the discovery of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 
 
(HIV-1) as the causative agent of AIDS in 1983, the search for an 
effective vaccine or a therapeutic cure has been the top priority in 
the fight against the expanding HIV/AIDS pandemic. However, 
because of the tremendous difficulties of HIV-1 vaccine design, 
generating an appropriate immunogen to elicit broadly neutralizing 
antibodies (bnAbs) against genetically divergent HIV-1 subtypes (1, 
2) has been unsuccessful. With the recent discovery of numerous 
HIV-1–specific bnAbs (3–9), it has become evident that viral coevo-
lution is likely required to drive B cell maturation to induce potent 
bnAbs during the natural course of infection (2, 10, 11). While there 
has been an increase in efforts to identify structure-guided nov-
el immunogen design for an efficacious vaccine (3, 12–14), using 
existing bnAbs as passive immunization is an alternative approach 
for HIV-1 prophylaxis and immunotherapy (4, 7, 15–20).
Numerous studies have investigated the potency, breadth, 
crystal structure, and mode of action of selected bnAbs, including 
their combined use both in vitro and in vivo (16, 21–23). Natural-
ly occurring resistant viruses, however, are readily found against 
these bnAbs when tested individually (9, 21). The bnAb-based 
monotherapy failed to induce durable suppression of plasma vire-
mia as resistant viruses emerged (20, 24). To improve HIV-1 neu-
tralization breadth and potency, bispecific bnAbs (bs-bnAbs) have 
been engineered using the available gene sequences of bnAbs 
 
(25–29). In particular, by CrossMAb and knobs-into-holes tech-
nologies, bs-bnAb 10E8V2.0/iMab displays exquisite HIV-1–neutral-
ization activity in humanized mouse models of HIV-1 prevention 
and treatment (30). Although bs-bnAbs are promising, their clin-
ical development faces large-scale manufacturing challenges and 
concerns of possible immunogenicity and poor pharmacokinetic 
properties. Gene transfer of bs-bnAbs may also face several tech-
nical challenges. For example, bs-bnAbs generated by the knobs-
into-holes method require codelivery of 2 or more genes into the 
same cell for proportional expression and assembly of antibody 
light and heavy chains (30). Nevertheless, the recent FDA approv-
al of a CD19- and CD3-targeting bispecific antibody for acute B 
The discovery of an HIV-1 cure remains a medical challenge because the virus rebounds quickly after the cessation of 
combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Here, we investigate the potential of an engineered tandem bispecific broadly 
neutralizing antibody (bs-bnAb) as an innovative product for HIV-1 prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. We discovered 
that by preserving 2 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) binding domains of each parental bnAb, a single gene–encoded 
tandem bs-bnAb, BiIA-SG, displayed substantially improved breadth and potency. BiIA-SG neutralized all 124 HIV-1–
pseudotyped viruses tested, including global subtypes/recombinant forms, transmitted/founder viruses, variants not 
susceptible to parental bnAbs and to many other bnAbs with an average IC50 value of 0.073 μg/ml (range < 0.001–1.03 μg/ml). 
In humanized mice, an injection of BiIA-SG conferred sterile protection when administered prior to challenges with diverse 
live HIV-1 stains. Moreover, whereas BiIA-SG delayed viral rebound in a short-term therapeutic setting when combined with 
cART, a single injection of adeno-associated virus–transferred (AAV-transferred) BiIA-SG gene resulted dose-dependently in 
prolonged in vivo expression of BiIA-SG, which was associated with complete viremia control and subsequent elimination of 
infected cells in humanized mice. These results warrant the clinical development of BiIA-SG as a promising bs-bnAb–based 
biomedical intervention for the prevention and treatment of HIV-1 infection.

scFv was engineered as a corresponding IA by fusion with human 
IgG1-Fc to generate IA-PG9, IA-PG16, IA-PGT128, IA-VRC01, and 
IA-Hu5A8 (Figure 1, A and B). The expression of released soluble 
IAs was readily detected by Western blot after transient transfec-
tion of human 293T cells (Figure 1C). While all IAs exhibited specif-
ic anti–HIV-1ADA activity, only IA-PGT128 displayed similar potency 
and the same sigmoidal slope of 100% neutralization as previously 
described for the native PGT128 (Figure 1D) (34). Furthermore, we 
measured the anti–HIV-1 activity of combined IAs in checkerboard 
experiments (35, 36). We found that IA-PGT128 in combination 
with IA-Hu5A8 exhibited the best synergistic effect based on com-
putational synergy volumes (Figure 1E and Supplemental Figure 1; 
supplemental material available online with this article; https:/
/doi.
org/10.1172/JCI96764DS1). We therefore focused on IA-PGT128 
and IA-Hu5A8 for BiIA construction. For mechanism study, we 
constructed BiIAs by 2 methods. Using the knobs-into-holes meth-
od, we generated a double gene–encoded (DG) bispecific IA (BiIA-
DG) with the modified IgG1-Fc domain, as previously described 
(Figure 2A) (25, 37). Using a gene tandem fusion method, we also 
constructed a single gene–encoded (SG) BiIA (BiIA-SG) through 
fusion of the PGT128 VL/VH to the N-terminal of IA-Hu5A8 VL/VH 
in tandem (Figure 2B). As a result, BiIA-SG is structurally unique 
with 4 scFv binding domains (2 for HIV-1 gp120 and 2 for CD4) as 
compared with BiIA-DG or other knobs-into-holes bs-bnAbs that 
contain 2 scFv binding domains (1 for each of the 2 target antigens), 
as previously described by others (25, 37).
As compared with parental IA-PGT128 and IA-Hu5A8, the 
expression of BiIA-SG and BiIA-DG was readily detected from 
transfected 293T cell supernatants with expected sizes deter-
mined by Western blot (Figure 2C). To determine their dual spec-
ificity, we measured protein binding by 2 methods, ELISA and 
cell lymphoblastic leukemia has shed light for bs-bnAb–based 
immunotherapy (31); allowing this bi-specific antibody to be used 
for clinical development.
 To date, the immunotherapeutic potential of gene-transferred 
bs-bnAbs has not been investigated in vivo against HIV-1 infection.
In this study, we developed a single gene–encoded tandem 
bispecific immunoadhesin molecule (BiIA), namely BiIA-SG. 
Engineered immunoadhesin (IA) is an antibody-like molecule, and 
in this study, IA refers to such molecules that contain the antigen- 
binding domain of the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of 
bnAbs in fusion with the immunoglobulin constant region, includ-
ing the hinge and Fc fragment (e.g., IgG-Fc) but without the con-
stant light chain (CL)/constant heavy chain 1 (CH1) (32, 33). We 
show that BiIA-SG not only displays a potent average IC50 value 
of 0.073 μg/ml against all 3 panels of 124 genetically divergent 
HIV-1 strains tested, but also completely prevents diverse live viral 
challenges in humanized mice. Mechanistically, the improved 
breadth and potency of the engineered BiIA-SG are associated 
with the preservation of 2 scFv binding domains of each parental 
bnAb, which is different from the conventional knobs-into-holes 
bs-bnAbs. Importantly, gene transfer of BiIA-SG displays the 
promising activity of eliminating HIV-1–infected cells in many 
humanized mice. Herein, we provide a proof-of-concept that BiIA-
SG is a promising agent for bs-bnAb–based postexposure viremia 
control and immunotherapy against HIV-1 infection.

and 2 dual-resistant viruses (Figure 3B) as well as 5 VRC01-resis-
tant viruses (Supplemental Figure 3) were neutralized by BiIA-
SG with improved IC90 or IC50 values. The improved potency of 
BiIA-SG was also observed with live replicating HIV-1 strains 
(Figure 3C). To further investigate its antiretroviral potency, we 
compared BiIA-SG with a panel of 7 bnAbs (VRC01, 3BNC117, 
PG09, PG16, 10-1074, PGT121, and 10E8) obtained from the 
NIH AIDS Reagent Program. BiIA-SG consistently exhibited the 
strongest potency and breadth against 8 genetically divergent and 
acute HIV-1 pseudoviruses, with average IC50 and IC90 values of 
0.023 μg/ml and 0.107 μg/ml, respectively (Figure 4A). BiIA-SG 
also had similar average IC50 and IC90 values of 0.018 μg/ml and 
0.111 μg/ml, respectively, against the NIH global panel of 12 HIV-1 
 
pseudoviruses (Figure 4B) (40). In addition, BiIA-SG has been 
independently tested in a collaborative laboratory with average 
IC50 and IC90 values of 0.05 μg/ml and 0.144 μg/ml, respective-
surface plasmon resonance (SPR). From the ELISA experiments, 
BiIA-SG exhibited slightly reduced binding activity to both sCD4 
and gp120 (Figure 2D), whereas BiIA-DG displayed enhanced 
binding to sCD4 but reduced interaction with gp120. Moreover, 
by SPR analysis, the KD values indicated that BiIA-SG had a com-
parable binding affinity to gp120 but a 229-fold reduced affinity to 
sCD4 (Table 1 and Supplemental Figure 2). Conversely, BiIA-DG 
had a comparable binding affinity to sCD4 but a 264-fold reduced 
affinity to gp120. Our results suggest that 2 PGT128 scFv domains 
in the single BiIA-SG molecule are necessary for high-affinity 
binding to gp120.
BiIA-SG displays significantly enhanced potency and breadth 
against HIV-1. To compare the breadth and potency of BiIA-SG 
and BiIA-DG with parental IA-PGT128 and IA-Hu5A8, we first 
tested our University of Hong Kong (HKU) panel of 40 pseudovi-
ruses (Supplemental Figure 3), which covered major global HIV-1 
 
subtypes B/B’, CRF01_AE, and C/CRF07_BC/CRF08_BC (34, 38). 
These 40 pseudoviruses included 8 acute and transmitted/found-
er (T/F) strains of various subtypes. VRC01-IgG, one of the sec-
ond-generation bnAbs in clinical trials (39), was also included for 
comparison. Since the molecular weights of IAs are smaller than 
those of BiIAs and regular antibodies, equimolar concentration 
(nM) is used for comparison. We found that the mean IC50 and 
IC90 values of BiIA-SG (1.1 nM/17.9 nM) were significantly bet-
ter than those of BiIA-DG (35.1 nM/85.3 nM), IA-PGT128 (69.0 
nM/99.6 nM), IA-Hu5A8 (13.0 nM/73.4 nM), and VRC01-IgG 
(29.2 nM/70.0 nM) (Figure 3A). As a control, the knobs-into-holes 
BiIA-DG was not significantly better than parental IA-PGT128 and 
IA-Hu5A8. This finding is consistent with the bs-bnAb PGT128/
iMab generated by the knobs-into-holes and the CrossMAb tech-
nologies (30). In contrast, BiIA-SG was able to neutralize 65% 
(26/40) of pseudoviruses with IC50 values less than 1 nM (~0.15 
μg/ml). Moreover, 13 IA-PGT128–resistant, 8 IA-Hu5A8–resistant,

IC50 value of 1.32 nM than that of IA-PGT128 (2.36 nM) (Figure 
3C, right). Their equimolar combination achieved an IC50 value of 
0.79 nM that was still less potent than that of BiIA-SG by 3-fold 
(0.26 nM). Similar results were confirmed using the NIH global 
panel of 8 of 12 HIV-1 pseudoviruses based on IC50 and IC90 values 
(Figure 4B). Overall, BiIA-SG is more potent against both live and 
genetically divergent viral strains as compared with IA-PGT128, 
IA-Hu5A8, or their combination in equimolar concentration. 
Mechanistically, the enhancement of BiIA-SG is probably relat-
ed to higher affinity cross-linking interactions with HIV-1 gp120 
based on the structural modeling (Supplemental Figure 5) (42).
BiIA-SG confers sterile protection against genetically divergent 
HIV-1 challenges in humanized mice. To determine the protection 
efficacy in vivo, we examined the effect of a single injection of 
BiIA-SG in the HIV-1/NSG-HuPBL model (Figure 5A) (41). A 
bioreactor product of BiIA-SG generated a peak of 90% purity 
by size exclusion chromatography analysis (Figure 5B).We then 
measured the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of BiIA-SG, 
which was purified from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, in 
4 healthy NSG-HuPBL mice (2 male [M] and 2 female [F]) and 
found that its calculated peripheral half-life (t1/2) was approxi-
mately 3.1 days (Figure 5C), which fell between the t1/2 values 
of 5.6 days for Hu5A8 and 2.2 days for PGT128 (7, 16). BiIA-SG 
ly, against a Tsinghua University panel of 72 HIV-1 pseudovirus-
es (Supplemental Figure 4). In this experiment, 21% (15/72) of 
pseudoviruses had IC50 values less than 0.001 μg/ml. Based on 
all 3 panels of 124 HIV-1 pseudoviruses tested, our results demon-
strate that BiIA-SG is superior to many bnAbs, including BiIA-DG, 
with a substantially enhanced average IC50 value of 0.073 μg/ml 
(range < 0.001–1.03 μg/ml) and 100% breadth.
To prepare for in vivo efficacy experiments, the anti–HIV-1 
 
activity of BiIA-SG was evaluated using 2 authentic live viral 
strains, the R5-tropic HIV-1JR-FL (subtype B) and the R5-tropic 
T/F virus HIV-1BJZS7 (subtype CRF01_AE). Both HIV-1JR-FL, a tier-
2 virus relatively resistant to antibody neutralization (8), and 
HIV-1BJZS7 established robust systemic and mucosal infections in 
NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ–human peripheral lymphocyte 
(NSG-HuPBL) mice, as we recently described (41). We found 
that live HIV-1JR-FL was resistant to IA-Hu5A8 neutralization but 
was sensitive to IA-PGT128 with an IC50 value of 12.07 nM (Fig-
ure 3C, left).The combined equimolar IA-Hu5A8 and IA-PGT128 
displayed enhanced neutralizing activity with the IC50 value 
improved by 6.4-fold to 1.88 nM compared with IA-PGT128. This 
improved activity, however, was still 6.2-fold less potent than BiIA-
SG, which had an IC50 value of 0.30 nM. The neutralization of 
 
HIV-1BJZS7 was different because IA-Hu5A8 had a slightly better

compared with parental IAs and the bnAb VRC01-
IgG against the HKU panel of 40 pseudoviruses

of IAs are smaller than those of BiIAs and regular 
antibodies, equimolar concentration (nM) is used

most predominant HIV-1 sexually transmitted subtypes (45), we 
subsequently determined the efficacy of BiIA-SG against live 
 
HIV-1BJZS7. Using the same dose and method, we found that BiIA-
SG also conferred complete protection against HIV-1BJZS7 (Figure 
5, n = 4, 2 M, 2 F). Moreover, all protected animals had undetect-
able P24+ T cells in their spleens, lungs, livers, kidneys, stomachs, 
small intestines, large intestines, and brains by immunofluores-
cence staining (Supplemental Figure 6). BiIA-SG could reach the 
intestinal mucosal sites within 24 hours after a single i.p. injection 
(Supplemental Figure 7). Our findings demonstrate that soluble 
BiIA-SG is effective for PrEP against genetically divergent live 
HIV-1 strains in humanized mice.
was then evaluated against HIV-1JR-FL in preexposure prophylaxis 
(PrEP) experiments using a previously reported dosage (10 mg/
kg, n = 5, 2 M, 3 F) (43, 44). Groups of NSG-HuPBL mice were 
injected with either BiIA-SG or a placebo (PBS) 1 hour before 
intraperitoneal (i.p.) inoculation with 10 ng P24 of HIV-1JR-FL 
(41). All placebo mice (n = 5, 3 M, 2 F) were infected with peak 
plasma viral loads up to 107 copies/ml (Figure 5D), and exhibit-
ed P24 antigenemia (Figure 5E), a trend of CD4+ T cell loss over 
time (Figure 5F), and P24+ T cells in blood and spleens (Figures 
5, G and H) at 2 weeks postinfection (wpi). In contrast, no signs 
of infection or CD4+ T cell loss were found in 5 of 5 mice that 
were pretreated with BiIA-SG. Since CRF01_AE is one of the

Single injection of AAV-vectored BiIA-SG eliminates HIV-infected 
splenocytes in humanized mice. To determine the therapeutic effect 
of BiIA-SG in vivo, we first compared it with cART in humanized 
mice. Four days after i.p. challenge with 10 ng P24 of HIV-1, mice 
were treated with cART (TDF+3TC+RAL regimen, daily), BiIA-
SG (400 μg, every 4 days), cART+BiIA-SG combination, or place-
bo for 3 weeks (Supplemental Figure 8). When compared with the 
placebo mice that exhibited high levels of viremia starting from 
day 4 after viral challenge, all 3 groups of treated mice showed 
viral suppression with subsequent viral rebound after treatment 
cessation. Interestingly, the cART+BiIA-SG mice showed a rel-
atively delayed viral rebound. These results suggest that short-
term treatment (3 weeks) by cART or BiIA-SG or cART+BiIA-SG 
is insufficient for sustained viral load control or elimination of 
HIV-1 infection in humanized mice.
We then sought to provide prolonged in vivo BiIA-SG expres-
sion using AAV transduction as a monotherapy (15, 17, 46, 47). 
BiIA-SG derived from AAV–BiIA-SG–injected mice tends to have 
an estimated peripheral t1/2 of about 21.7 days (Supplemental Fig-
ure 9), which is longer than the t1/2 of 3.1 days of the product puri-
fied from CHO cells in vitro (Figure 5C). Two weeks after live HIV-1 
infection, groups of NSG-HuPBL mice in 2 separate experiments 
were treated with a control AAV-GFP (4 × 109 genomic copies [gc] 
 
n = 5, 3 M, 2 F) or with a single injection of AAV–BiIA-SG in low-, 
middle-, or high-dose levels (low dose, 1 × 109 gc, n = 2, 1 M, 1 F; mid-
dle dose, 4 × 109 gc, n = 5, 3 M, 2 F; and high dose, 1 × 1011 gc, n = 8, 
 
4 M, 4 F). A group of 4 uninfected mice (2 M, 2 F) served as a nega-
tive control (Figure 6A). Infected animals treated with AAV-GFP or 
low-dose AAV–BiIA-SG exhibited persistent viremia (Figure 6B). 
Of note, a trend of reduced viral load over time was detected in 
these mice and it was probably caused by the gradual loss of human 
CD4+ T cells and corresponding virus-producing cells. In contrast, 
with increased blood concentrations of BiIA-SG over time, some 
infected mice treated with middle (4/5) or high doses (5/8) of AAV–

al cities in the world (45) but also in small local communities and 
subpopulations, such as men who have sex with men (48, 49). On 
the other hand, most bnAbs are not effective against all circulating 
global HIV-1 strains (Figure 4). For example, PGT128 neutralized 
27% and 72% of viruses examined in 2 previous studies (9, 21). In 
our study, PGT128 was able to neutralize 72.5% of viruses tested. 
Moreover, 7% of our viruses, including the live HIV-1JR-FL, were not 
susceptible to Hu5A8 neutralization. In contrast to either PGT128 
or Hu5A8 alone, BiIA-SG not only neutralizes 100% of the 3 pan-
els of 124 pseudoviruses tested, including the global panel of 12 
HIV-1 strains, with substantially improved IC90 values, but also is 
more potent than many newly discovered bnAbs tested (Figure 4). 
Critically, our data also demonstrate that BiIA-SG provides com-
plete protection against live challenges with genetically divergent 
HIV-1JR-FL and HIV-1BJZS7. Using the same experimental design and 
dosage, a previous study showed that bnAb b12 provided 50% pro-
tection against HIV-1JR-CSF in humanized mice (44). It is feasible that 
BiIA-SG can be applied to fight the evolving AIDS epidemic with 
genetically diverse viruses without the need for prior viral neutral-
ization susceptibility tests. It may indeed offer cost effectiveness 
compared with the combined use of a cocktail of bnAbs (18, 22).
Patients with HIV-1 require lifelong cART mainly because the 
virus persists in the latent viral reservoir. One of the major tasks 
in HIV-1 cure research is to discover means to eliminate infected 
cells, especially those in the reservoir (50). Using HIV-infected 
humanized mice as a model, a recent study indicated that viral 
latency is established prior to peak viremia because cART initiat-
ed as early as 5 days after infection failed to prevent viral rebound 
after the cessation of the cART and bnAbs (22). Encouragingly, 
combination of cART and latency-reversing agents with individual 
or a cocktail of bnAbs has significantly decreased the latent reser-
voir as measured by delayed viral rebound in humanized mice (18, 
22, 51, 52). It has been suggested that potent bnAbs might have the 
advantage to either decrease the half-lives of HIV-1–infected cells 
in vivo by a FcγR-dependent mechanism or enhance host humoral 
immunity against HIV-1 probably by forming immune complex for 
eliciting CD8+ T cell responses (51, 52). Moreover, by conjugating 
particular dual or ternary bnAbs, the recently developed bispecific 
10E8v2.0/iMab and trispecific VRC01/PGDM1400/10E8 achieved 
exquisite breadth and potency with enhanced protective and ther-
apeutic effects (30, 53). In addition, the hinge-modified bs-bnAb 
3BNC117/PGT135 showed an improved Fab flexibility and neutral-
ization activity (54). In our humanized mouse model, short-term 
treatment (3 weeks) with either cART or BiIA-SG alone, or with 
combined cART and BiIA-SG, was insufficient to prevent viral 
rebound when provided as early as 4 days after live HIV-1 infec-
tion. In contrast, a single intramuscular injection of AAV–BiIA-SG 
at a dose of 4 × 109 gc (middle) or 1 × 1011 gc (high) in 2 separate 
experiments could produce a sufficient level of functional BiIA-SG 
in vivo to achieve complete viral load suppression in 3 and 5 ani-
mals at 11 wpi, respectively. By 11 wpi, 5 of these 8 controller mice 
had neither detectable HIV-1 DNA nor any replication-competent 
viruses in their splenocytes as detected by VOA and cell adoptive 
transfer experiments. Therefore, in vivo gene transfer of BiIA-SG 
using an AAV vector was able to eliminate infected splenocytes in 
42% (5/12) of the HIV-1–infected humanized mice treated with 
AAV–BiIA-SG in middle or high doses in the absence of cART or 
BiIA-SG had viral loads suppressed to undetectable levels from 
5–11 wpi (Figure 6B). The level of peripheral BiIA-SG was inverse-
ly correlated with the viral load at 11 wpi (Figure 6C). At this end-
point, most mice with an undetectable viral load had neither mea-
surable proviral DNA as detected by digital PCR (Figure 6D) nor 
replicating-competent virus by viral outgrowth assays (VOAs) (Fig-
ure 6E). Moreover, these animals had undetectable P24+ T cells in 
their spleens, lungs, intestines, and brains by immunofluorescence 
staining (Supplemental Figure 10). These results demonstrate that 
single high-dose injection of AAV–BiIA-SG results in prolonged t1/2 
and production of functional BiIA-SG in vivo that in turn eliminates 
infected cells in humanized mice.
To further validate these results, we conducted cell adoptive 
transfer experiments using 1 million splenocytes from each treat-
ed or AAV-GFP control mouse transferred into individual healthy 
recipient animals (uninfected, n = 4, 2 M, 2 F; AAV-GFP, n = 5, 3 M, 
2 F; AAV–BiIA-SG/M, n = 5, 3 M, 2 F; AAV–BiIA-SG/H, n = 8, 4 M, 
4 F). One recipient mouse of the middle-dose group died before 
analysis. Four weeks after the adoptive transfer, we consistently 
found that 5 of 12 (42%) recipient mice, which received spleno-
cytes from VOA-negative donor mice (2 in the middle- and 3 in the 
high-dose group), had neither detectable viral load in the serum 
nor P24+ T cells in the blood or spleens (Figure 6, F–H). In con-
trast, live HIV-1 and HIV-infected cells were readily detected in all 
humanized mice receiving splenocytes from the AAV-GFP group. 
Our results demonstrate that gene transfer of engineered BiIA-SG 
leads to the elimination of infected splenocytes, which is likely 
associated with relatively prolonged in vivo expression of BiIA-SG 
and VOA negativity in humanized mice.
Discussion
In this study, we report to our knowledge the first single gene–
encoded tandem BiIA-SG to facilitate gene transfer of a bs-bnAb–
based intervention for HIV-1 prevention and immunotherapy. 
Each BiIA-SG molecule has 4 scFv-binding domains in total, 2 
from each of its parental IAs, PGT128 and Hu5A8. It is structural-
ly different from the previously reported bs-bnAb PGT128/iMab 
that contains only 1 PGT128 and 1 Hu5A8 scFv-binding domain 
(30). Mechanistically, including 2 PGT128 scFv-binding domains 
in each BiIA-SG molecule is likely necessary to perform the high- 
affinity cross-linking interaction with HIV-1 gp120 (42). This 
notion is in line with the critical topology of PGT128 interaction 
with the gp120 outer domain at the top surface of the spike (42, 48, 
49). In support of this notion, we consistently demonstrated that 
BiIA-SG is significantly superior to BiIA-DG (Figure 3A), which 
mimics the PGT128/iMab, for both improved binding to gp120 
and enhanced anti–HIV-1 activity. Considering that PGT128 is 
among the few bnAbs that can achieve a sigmoidal slope of 100% 
neutralization against HIV-1 infection (34), we believe that the 
preservation of 2 scFv-binding domains of PGT128 in each BiIA-
SG molecule is at least one of the essential mechanisms underly-
ing its substantially improved potency and breadth.
With substantially improved breadth and potency, BiIA-SG 
is a promising bs-bnAb for potential clinical development. Viral 
genetic diversity is one of the major obstacles to bnAb-based HIV-1 
prevention and immunotherapy. On the one hand, multiple HIV-1 
 
subtypes are readily diagnosed nowadays not only in individu-

pared by automated codon optimization and DNA synthesis accord-
ing to published sequences (7–9). Each scFv was constructed as a 
VL linked to a VH via a 15-mer (Gly4Ser)3 linker (Figure 1). We fused 
scFvs of these bnAbs to the human immunoglobulin CH2-CH3 (hIgG1-
Fc, containing an E333V mutation according to the EU numbering) 
region. To create secretory antibodies, the secretory signal peptide of 
tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was linked to the N-termini of the 
IAs using PCR-based techniques to enhance the protein expression 
and release. Two genes encoded BiIA-DG, each with 2 correspond-
ing residue mutations to promote the dimerization of electrostatically 
matched Fc chains using the knobs-into-holes method (25, 37). BiIA-
SG was engineered by fusion of scFv-PGT128 to the 5′ end of the scFv-
Hu5A8-hIgG1-Fc backbone with a 20-mer (Gly4Ser)4 linker in between 
(Figure 2). Because we used the original sequence of Hu5A8 but not 
the ibalizumab (28, 60), we kept the name Hu5A8 in this study.
IA or BiIA expression and purification. 293T cells (ATCC) were trans-
fected with plasmids encoding various IA or BiIA genes and cultured for 
72 hours at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator after the transfection. IA-con-
taining culture supernatants were harvested and centrifuged at 1,000 g 
for 10 minutes. IAs were purified immediately by affinity chromatogra-
phy using Protein G–Agarose (Life Technologies) according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. The purified IAs and BiIAs were concentrated 
by an Amicon ultracentrifuge filter device (molecular weight cutoff, 50 
kDa; Millipore) to a volume of 0.2 ml in PBS (Life Technologies), and 
stored at –80°C. Only BiIA-DG was produced by cotransfection of 293T 
cells using equal amounts of 2 expression vectors.
Western blot analysis. The purity and molecular weights of IAs and 
BiIAs were analyzed in 10% SDS-PAGE separating gels with Coomassie 
Blue G-250 stain (ThermoScientific). The separated proteins were 
transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore) for antibody staining. 
The reducing and nonreducing conditions refer to the presence and 
absence of β-mercaptoethanol in the gel-loading buffer. The secondary 
antibody was an IRDye 800CW-conjugated goat anti–human IgG-Fc 
domain antibody (catalog 926-32232, Rockland). Protein bands were 
visualized using the Odyssey Image System (Li-COR).
Binding specificity of IA and BiIA by ELISA. Each well of high-binding 
96-well plates (Costar) was coated with 50 ng gp120 or sCD4 overnight. 
After washing, the plates were blocked for 2 hours with the blocking 
buffer containing 2% BSA (catalog 10857, Affymetrix), 1 μM EDTA (cat-
alog AM9260G, Life Technologies), and 0.05% Tween-PBS (catalog 
Sc-29113, Santa Cruz) and then incubated with serially diluted IA/BiIA 
for 60 minutes at 37°C. After washing, the HRP-conjugated goat anti–
human detection antibody (catalog sc2907, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) 
was added for 1 hour as previously described (61), followed by washing 
and addition of 100 μl HRP chromogenic substrate 3,3′,5,5′-Tetrameth-
ylbenzidine (TMB) (catalog 860336, MilliporeSigma). The ODs were 
measured at 450 nm using the VICTOR3 1420 Multilabel Counter 
(PerkinElmer). The background values given by incubation of PBS 
alone in coated wells were subtracted. The positivity was determined 
when the OD value was 2-fold above the negative controls (e.g., normal 
serum). All experiments were performed in duplicate.
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. The binding kinetics/
affinity of IA and BiIA to gp120 and sCD4 were tested in PBS running 
buffer at 25°C by SPR analysis using a Biacore X100 machine (GE 
Healthcare) as previously described (25). HIV-1JR-FL gp120 and sCD4 
proteins (30 μg/ml) were covalently coupled to CM5 sensor chips (GE 
Healthcare) by amine chemistry at pH 5.0, resulting in an immobiliza-
latency-reversing agents. These findings are promising because in 
combination with cART, a higher dose of 2.5 × 1011 gc AAV10-1074 
and AAV3BNC117 was required to prevent 6 of 7 and 3 of 5 human-
ized mice from viral rebound, respectively (22). Moreover, a dose 
of 1 × 1011 gc AAVVRC01 was necessary to provide protection in 7 of 
10 humanized mice against HIV-1JR-CSF challenge (17). Our data, 
therefore, demonstrated a proof-of-concept that in the absence of 
cART or latency inducers, AAV–BiIA-SG monotherapy at a dose of 
4 × 109 gc or higher results in HIV-1 control and potentially effec-
tively eliminates infected splenocytes in humanized mice.
Besides the cross-linking interactions with HIV-1 gp120 as 
mentioned above, we cannot exclude other mechanisms that may 
also contribute to the enhanced anti–HIV activity of BiIA-SG. In 
regard to neutralizing viruses that are resistant to both PGT128 
and Hu5A8, one possible mechanism is that BiIA-SG may confer 
simultaneous blockade of HIV-1 gp120 and host receptor CD4. 
Because BiIA-SG has an enhanced anti–HIV potency compared 
with PGT128 and Hu5A8 in combination, BiIA-SG may also allow 
the enrichment of the PGT128 domains at the portal of viral entry 
for more efficient inhibition, as suggested for other bs-bnAbs (28, 
30). In addition, it is possible that the binding of BiIA-SG Hu5A8 
domains to CD4 increases the local concentration of PGT128 near 
the cell membrane for enhanced HIV-1 neutralization. This mech-
anism is possible because antibody membrane anchoring can 
increase neutralizing activities of both bnAbs and nonneutralizing 
anti–HIV antibodies (55, 56). Future structural analysis of BiIA-SG 
is necessary to answer its mode of action. Comparing the thera-
peutic efficacy of the cART+BiIA-SG regimen with the AAV–BiIA-
SG regimen, we speculate that AAV–BiIA-SG provides a relatively 
prolonged and increased in vivo supply of functional BiIA-SG, and 
therefore, is more effective at the elimination of infected spleno-
cytes in humanized mice.
It should be noted that HIV-1–infected humanized NSG-HuP-
BL mice do not fully represent infected patients, although this 
model has been widely used to study bnAb-based HIV-1 immu-
notherapy (4, 16, 18). To this end, there are no measurable host 
immune responses against BiIA-SG and the inoculated viruses. 
Moreover, besides infected T cells, HIV-1 latency in other cell 
types remains to be evaluated (41). These caveats need to be care-
fully investigated in the future using relevant models. For exam-
ple, the humanized bone marrow–liver–thymus (BLT) mouse 
model could be reconstituted with a broader range of human T 
cells, B cells, monocytes, and macrophages (57, 58). Human T cell 
development in transplanted thymus could be observed in the BLT 
model. Moreover, the humanized myeloid-only mice would be 
useful to study HIV-1 persistence in tissue-resident macrophages 
during bnAb immunotherapy (59). Since humanized mice have 
some limitations, such as incomplete human immune cells, lack of 
human lymph nodes, and difficulty in generating human antibody 
and memory T cell immune responses, future BiIA-SG efficacy 
studies are merited in immune competent nonhuman primate 
models such as simian human immunodeficiency virus–infected 
rhesus macaques or directly in human trials (24, 53).

with 5 ml PBS using an 18-gauge needle (catalog NN-1825R, Terumo). 
Any remaining mucus was then manually extruded into the collection 
tube. The raw flush was vortexed for 15 seconds and centrifuged for 5 
minutes at 16,000 g and the supernatant was separated. The flushed 
intestines were weighed and homogenized with 100 μl PBS. The 
homogenate was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 16,000 g and the super-
natant was separated. The antibody concentration in small intestine 
and large intestine mucus and homogenate was detected by ELISA.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Blood samples 
were collected from the facial veins of mice in Eppendorf tubes con-
taining 50 μl anticoagulant (0.5 M EDTA) and were then centrifuged 
for 5 minutes at 1,150 g in a microcentrifuge. The plasma was stored 
for future analysis, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of 1× 
RBC lysis buffer (BD Bioscience) and incubated on ice for at least 10 
minutes to remove red blood cells. After the lysis, the cells were pel-
leted at 1,150 g in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes at room temperature 
and stained for 60 minutes at 4°C with 100 μl of a cocktail containing 
2 μl anti–human CD3-PB (catalog 300442/UCHT1), 2 μl anti–human 
CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5 (catalog 317428/OKT4), 2 μl anti–human CD8-PE 
(catalog 344706/SK1), and 2 μl anti–human CD45 PE/Cy7 antibod-
ies (catalog 304016/H130) (all from Biolegend). The samples were 
washed with PBS supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and then 
were centrifuged at 800 g in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes. The pel-
leted cells were resuspended in 300 μl wash buffer and analyzed on a 
FACSAria III flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson). The samples were 
gated for human CD45 expression before analyzing the T cell subsets 
based on the CD3, CD4, and CD8 markers within this subset.
Immunofluorescence (IFA) staining of HIV-infected cells in tissues. 
Spleen and other tissues were immersed in 10% neutral buffered for-
malin (catalog Z2902, MilliporeSigma) for 24 hours. After the forma-
lin fixation, the tissues were placed in 70% ethanol (Merck) and sub-
sequently embedded with paraffin. Tissue sections (4-μm thick) were 
used for immunohistochemical staining for HIV-P24 detection using 
the Kal-1 murine monoclonal antibody (catalog M085701, Dako) as 
we previously described (41). Confocal images were obtained with a 
Carl Zeiss LSM 700 microscope using the ZEN 2012 software.
Viral RNA load measurement by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). 
Viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qia-
gen). Each RNA sample was reverse transcribed to 20 μl cDNA with 
the RT-PCR Prime Script Kit (Takara). The cDNA (2 μl) was used in a 
20 μl qRT-PCR reaction with the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix 
(Life Technologies), a TaqMan probe (5′-FAM−CTCTCT CCTTCT 
AGCCTC−MGB-3′), and primers designed to target the P17 gene of 
HIV-1 (5′-TACTGA CGCTCT CGCACC-3′ and 5′-TCTCGA CGCAGG 
ACTCG-3′). The samples were run in triplicate on an Eppendorf Real-
plex4 Mastercycler (Eppendorf). The following cycling conditions were 
used: 1 cycle of 50°C for 2 minutes, 1 cycle of 95°C for 10 minutes, and 
40 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minutes. The virus titer 
was determined by comparison with a standard curve generated using 
RNA extracted from a serially diluted reference viral stock. The limit 
of detection was 500 copies per milliliter for HIV-1JR-FL and HIV-1BJZS7.
HIV-1 proviral DNA measurement by digital PCR. Cell-associated 
 
HIV-1 proviral DNA was quantified by QuantStudio 3D digital PCR Sys-
tem (Life Technologies). Briefly, total cellular DNA was extracted using 
the QIAmp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen) and eluted in 40 μl volume. 
Purified DNA was quantified for HIV-1 proviral DNA by the QuantStu-
dio 3D Digital PCR System using the primers, probe, and reaction condi-
tion level of 2,000 response units (RUs) and 4,000 RUs, respective-
ly. BiIA-SG, BiIA-DG, or parental IA was injected through flow cells at 
2-fold dilutions starting from 125 nM at a rate of 30 μl/min with 3-min-
ute association and 8-minute dissociation. The sensor surface was 
regenerated between each experiment with a 30-second injection of 
10 mM glycine•HCl (pH 2.5) at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Binding curves 
were plotted after the subtraction of backgrounds. The 2:1 bivalent ana-
lyte model was used for the calculations according to the instructions.
HIV-1 neutralization assay. The Global Panel HIV-1 Env clones 
were obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program (catalog 12670) 
(40). The in-house panel of 40 Env clones was generated by us or pro-
vided by our collaborator (H Shang, China Medical University, Shen-
yang, China). A standard inoculum of 200 TCID50 of each pseudovi-
rus was used to test the potency and breadth of various neutralizing 
antibodies as previously described (62–64). Pseudovirus neutraliza-
tion was measured using a luciferase-based assay in GHOST(3)-X4R5 
(catalog 3942, NIH AIDS Reagent Program) (35, 38). Each IA and BiIA 
was tested in duplicate with a 3-fold serial dilution. The 50% and 90% 
inhibitory concentrations (IC50 and IC90) of each IA and BiIA were 
calculated to reflect anti–HIV-1 potency. The synergistic effects of 
paired IAs were measured by a checkerboard synergy assay and calcu-
lated using the MacSynergy II software as previously described (36). 
Accordingly, the synergy volumes of –50 to 50, 50 to 100, and >100 
in a synergy plot at the 95% CI were used to define additive, slight 
synergistic, and highly synergistic effects, respectively. For live HIV-1 
neutralization, a standard viral inoculum of 200 TCID50 was used for 
the assay in TZM-bl cells (catalog 8129, NIH AIDS Reagent Program).
Plasma BiIA-SG quantification by ELISA. For ELISA, 25 ng HIV-1JR-FL 
gp120 in coating buffer (pH 9.6) was used to coat 96-well plates (Costar) 
at 4°C overnight. After washing, the plates were blocked for 1 hour with 
blocking buffer (5% skim milk in PBS) and then incubated with serially 
diluted BiIAs or BiIA-containing sera for 60 minutes at 37°C. After wash-
ing, goat anti–human secondary antibody conjugated with HRP (catalog 
sc2907, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added for 1 hour, followed by 
washing and adding 100 μl HRP chromogenic substrate 3,3′,5,5′-TMB 
(catalog T4444, MilliporeSigma). ODs were measured at 450 nm using 
the VICTOR3 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer). All experiments 
were performed in duplicate.
Humanized mouse model. Animal procedures that might cause 
more than slight pain or distress were performed with appropriate 
sedation or anesthesia. Immunodeficient NSG mice were purchased 
from the Jackson Laboratory (catalog 005557). Humanized NSG- 
HuPBL mice were generated from 4- to 6-week-old NSG mice as we 
previously described (41).
Purity and half-life of BiIA-SG. The purity of BiIA-SG was mea-
sured by size exclusion–high-performance liquid chromatography 
(SEC-HPLC). BiIA-SG purified from CHO cells was injected i.p. in to 4 
NSG-HuPBL mice at a dose of 20 mg/kg. ELISA was used to measure 
the serum concentration of BiIA-SG over a period of 7 days. The t1/2 of 
BiIA-SG was computed as ln (2)/k, where k is a rate constant expressed 
reciprocally of the x axis time units by the 1-phase decay equation in the 
GraphPad software. 
Intestinal flush and homogenates preparation. A single dose of 10 
mg/kg BiIA-SG was i.p. injected into 4 NSG-HuPBL mice. Mucus, 
intestinal homogenates, and plasma specimens were collected 24 
hours later as previously described (65). Sections (4 cm) from the small 
and large intestines were excised from NSG-HuPBL mice and flushed

cells (catalog 240109, Agilent Technologies) were infected with AAV–
BiIA-SG. The transgene expression was tested either by FACS on cell 
surface or by ELISA in cell supernatants after 6 days of infection.
Viral outgrowth assay (VOA). VOA assays were performed as previ-
ously described (66). Briefly, one million splenocytes from AAV-treat-
ed mice were seeded into each well of 24-well plates (Corning) in 500 
μl RPMI 1640 culture medium (Life Technologies) containing 10% 
FBS (Life Technologies), and then stimulated by adding 1 μg/ml iono-
mycin (catalog I9657, MilliporeSigma) and 0.5 μg/ml phorbol 12-myri-
state 13-acetate (PMA, catalog P8139 Sigma-Aldrich). Stimulated 
splenocytes were cultured for 48 hours at 37°C, 5% CO2, and 100% 
humidity. Viral RNA copy numbers in culture supernatants were test-
ed by qRT-PCR as mentioned above.
Cell adoptive transfer experiment. One million donor splenocytes 
in 100 μl PBS were delivered through i.p. injection into each healthy 
NSG-HuPBL mouse. Four weeks later, recipient mice were sacri-
ficed for analysis.
Statistics. FACS data were analyzed with FlowJo 7.6 software. 
Graphs were generated with GraphPad Prism 5.01 software (Graph-
Pad Software). Two-tailed Student’s t tests were used for group com-
parisons. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant with neces-
sary mean ± SEM or mean ± SD.
Study approval. All animal experimental procedures were 
approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching 
and Research (CULATR 2786-12) at the Laboratory Animal Unit of 
The University of Hong Kong. The Laboratory Animal Unit is fully 
accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of 
Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC International).

tions as mentioned above for post-RT HIV-1 RNA quantification. Human 
 
CCR5 DNA was quantified with primers (5′-ATGAT TCCTG GGAGA 
GACGC-3′ and 5′-AGCCA GGACG GTCAC CTT-3′) and the sequence- 
specific probe (5′-VIC-AACAC AGCCA CCACC CAAGT GATCA- 
TAMRA-3′). All PCR reactions contained 7.25 μl Quantstudio 3D digi-
tal PCR master mix v2 in 14.5 μl reaction volume. HIV-1 proviral load is 
reported as copies per cell justified by cell numbers from CCR5 copies.
In vivo efficacy of BiIA-SG in humanized mice. For PrEP experi-
ments, 1 day before HIV-1 challenge, blood samples from NSG-HuPBL 
mice were subjected to flow cytometry to determine the baseline CD4/
CD8 ratios. On the following day, 200 μg (10 mg/kg) BiIA-SG was 
injected i.p. into NSG-HuPBL mice (44). One hour later the mice were 
challenged through the i.p. route with 10 ng P24 of live HIV-1JR-FL (466 
TCID50) or HIV-1BJZS7 (640 TCID50) diluted in 100 μl PBS (41). These 
mice were subjected to weekly blood sampling to monitor viral load, 
CD4/CD8 ratios, and P24+ cells, and finally were sacrificed for the 
detection of infected cells throughout the body. For cART treatment 
experiments, NSG-HuPBL mice were challenged through i.p. route 
with 10 ng P24 HIV-1BJZS7. Four days after HIV-1 challenge, mice were 
subjected to 4 different treatments: cART+BiIA-SG, cART, BiIA-SG, 
and placebo. The cART cocktail was prepared as previously described 
(22). Individual tablets of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF, Gilead), 
Lamivudine (3TC, Shandong Weifang Pharmaceutical Factory Co.), 
and Raltegravir (RAL, MSD Pharmaceuticals) were triturated into fine 
powder and suspended in 100 μl PBS. The cART cocktail (TDF 2.46 
mg, 3TC 1.48 mg, RAL 1.23 mg) was administered by daily oral gavage 
to each mouse. BiIA-SG was i.p. injected (400 μg per mouse) every 4 
days. All mice were subjected to weekly blood sampling to monitor 
viral load and were sacrificed 63 days after HIV-1 challenge.
AAV–BiIA-SG production and quantification. AAV–BiIA-SG produc-
tion was conducted as previously described (15). An AAV Helper-Free 
System was purchased from Cell Biolabs. The pAAV-MCS plasmid 
containing the BiIA-SG transgene or the pAAV–IRES-hrGFP control 
was cotransfected into AAV-293T cells together with the helper vector 
pHELP (catalog 240071, Agilent Technologies) and pAAV-DJ (catalog 
VPK-430-DJ, Cell Biolabs) at a ratio of 1:1:1 using the polyethylenimine 
(PEI) transfection reagent (Polysciences Inc.) in Opti-MEM medium 
(Gibco). The AAV–BiIA-SG supernatant was collected at 48, 72, 96, and 
120 hours after transfection, concentrated with 5× polyethylene gly-
col (PEG) 8000 (catalog 89510, MilliporeSigma) and finally purified 
by 1.37 g/ml cesium chloride centrifugation. The final AAV–BiIA-SG 
stock was dissolved in PBS, aliquoted, and stored at –80°C. Purified 
AAV–BiIA-SG was quantified by qPCR as previously described (15). 
Briefly, a frozen aliquot of AAV–BiIA-SG was treated with DNase I (Mil-
liporeSigma) for 30 minutes at 37°C, and then quantified with SYBR 
Premix Ex Taq II (Takara) and primers specific for the CMV enhancer 
(AAV-Mono-CMV-F: CCATTG ACGTCA ATGGGT GGAGT and AAV-
Mono-CMV-R: GCCAAG TAGGAA AGTCCC ATAAGG) or the BiIA-
SG transgene (AAV-mono-F 383–406: GGACTC TGGTCA CTGTCA 
GCAGCG and AAV-mono-R 486–406: ACCCTT TCGCCC AGTGAG 
ACG). The samples were tested in triplicates on the ViiA 7 instrument 
(Applied Biosystems). The following PCR conditions were performed: 1 
cycle of 50°C for 2 minutes, 1 cycle of 95°C for 10 minutes, 40 cycles of 
95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 60 seconds. The virus titer was deter-
mined by comparison with a standard curve generated using a purified 
DNA cut fragment after EcoRI/HindIII cut from the AAV-GFP vector. 
To evaluate the functional activity of the titered virus, AAV-HT1080
