ABSTRACT
The Ebola virus (EBOV) genome encodes a partly conserved 40-residue
nonstructural polypeptide, called the delta peptide, that is produced in abundance
during Ebola virus disease (EVD). The function of the delta peptide is unknown, but
sequence analysis has suggested that delta peptide could be a viroporin, belonging
to a diverse family of membrane-permeabilizing small polypeptides involved in repli-
cation and pathogenesis of numerous viruses. Full-length and conserved C-terminal
delta peptide fragments permeabilize the plasma membranes of nucleated cells of
rodent, dog, monkey, and human origin; increase ion permeability across confluent
cell monolayers; and permeabilize synthetic lipid bilayers. Permeabilization activity is
completely dependent on the disulfide bond between the two conserved cysteines.
The conserved C-terminal portion of the peptide is biochemically stable in human
serum, and most serum-stable fragments have full activity. Taken together, the evi-
dence strongly suggests that Ebola virus delta peptide is a viroporin and that it may
be a novel, targetable aspect of Ebola virus disease pathology.
IMPORTANCE During the unparalleled West African outbreak of Ebola virus disease
(EVD) that began in late 2013, the lack of effective countermeasures resulted in
chains of serial infection and a high mortality rate among infected patients. A better
understanding of disease pathology is desperately needed to develop better coun-
termeasures. We show here that the Ebola virus delta peptide, a conserved non-
structural protein produced in large quantities by infected cells, has the characteris-
tics of a viroporin. This information suggests a critical role for the delta peptide in
Ebola virus disease pathology and as a possible target for novel countermeasures.

A
n unprecedented global health emergency began in December 2013 when an
18-month-old child became infected with Ebola virus (EBOV) Makona variant in the
West African country of Guinea. The origin of Ebola virus in West Africa in not known,
but there has been speculation that the outbreak was initiated by an epizoonotic
transmission by a bat from a colony occupying a hollow tree near the child’
s village of
Meliandou (1). The child died of Ebola virus disease (EVD), as did several members of his
family and other village residents. From Meliandou, EBOV ultimately spread by human-
to-human contact throughout much of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone and made
incursions into other West African nations, Europe, and the United States. During the
outbreak, which peaked in late 2014, more than 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths were
reported (2). Long-term persistence of EBOV in immunologically privileged compart-
ments, such as the testes (3), eye (4), mammary glands (5), and cerebrospinal fluid (6),
has been documented. A few new Ebola cases continued into 2016, including sexually

 transmitted cases (7). While it is unknown whether EBOV is present in reservoir animal
species throughout the forested area of West Africa, it is likely that the subregion, or
other regions, will experience future reemergences of EBOV.
EVD in West Africa is characterized by fever, weakness, and severe gastrointestinal
illness that causes severe fluid loss, electrolyte imbalance, and multiorgan failure (8, 9).
The 2013-2016 West African outbreak of the Ebola virus variant Makona, like the small,
sporadic outbreaks of other Ebola virus variants that had occurred in middle Africa over
the last 40 years, had a high mortality rate because there is no effective, widely
available treatment. Most EVD patients in West Africa received only limited supportive
care. Progress is being made toward vaccines (10), an approach that may serve health
care workers and known contacts of EVD cases. However, only modest progress was
made toward direct therapeutic countermeasure development during the recent out-
break. Development of effective therapies will depend on a better understanding of
EBOV pathogenesis. Toward this goal, we are characterizing the delta peptide of EBOV,
a conserved segment of the Ebola virus nonstructural proteome to which no function
has yet been definitively assigned.
The delta peptide is the product of variant envelope glycoprotein (GP) production,
which occurs via differential mRNA editing (11, 12). As shown in Fig. 1A, editing at a
genomic 7U site can add one or more untemplated adenines to the GP mRNA
sequence, shifting the downstream translational reading frame. Virion-associated GP,
which is encoded by an mRNA containing one additional nontemplated adenosine,
traffics through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), becomes glycosylated, and is delivered
to the plasma membrane, where it is anchored by the carboxyl-terminal helical trans-
membrane (TM) domain. The major form of GP is the soluble secreted form (sGP), which
is the product of unedited GP mRNA. This form of GP is produced in large excess over
virion-associated GP (12, 13) and is likely an immune system decoy (14). It lacks much
of the C-terminal portion of GP, including the membrane anchor, but contains addi-
tional carboxyl-terminal amino acids not present in full-length GP (12, 15). Intracellular
processing of sGP, which includes cleavage at a furin-like protease-sensitive site that is
not present in viral GP, releases mature dimeric sGP for secretion, along with the
carboxyl-terminal 40-amino-acid sequence that is called the delta peptide.
Recently (16), we noted that delta peptides from various related filoviruses have a
high abundance of cationic and aromatic residues and are potentially amphipathic,
properties that are found in many membrane-permeabilizing peptides (17). We hy-
pothesized that the Ebola virus delta peptide might be a viroporin, a virus-encoded
small protein that can permeabilize one or more internal cell membranes, the plasma
membrane of animal cells, or the viral envelope. Here, we test synthetic Ebola virus
delta peptide for cell-permeabilizing and cytotoxic activities and show that it is a potent
viroporin.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Delta peptide of Ebola virus. Delta peptides of Ebola virus representative species
are 40 to 49 residues long and are comprised of a variable N-terminal segment of 17
to 18 residues followed by a better-conserved C-terminal segment of 23 to 31 residues
(Fig. 1B). Conserved residues in the C terminus include two cysteines, as well as
aromatic and basic residues. There are two ways in which the Ebola virus delta peptide
could form an amphipathic, membrane-active molecule. First, it has potential amphi-
pathic character in �-helical form (16), a structural motif that drives the membrane
activity of many pore-forming peptides, including some viroporins (18, 19). Second, the
conserved pair of cysteine residues suggests that delta peptides could form a disulfide
cross-linked hairpin structure that could also be amphipathic. Such a structure would
be similar to many membrane-permeabilizing antimicrobial peptides (20). To determine
whether the Ebola virus delta peptide has membrane-permeabilizing, viroporin-like
activity in either of these two structural states, we made a set of EBOV delta peptide
variants using the Makona variant sequence from West Africa (21). We made oxidized
(disulfide cross-linked) and reduced full-length Ebola delta peptide (E40ox and E40red,

 FIG 1 Ebola virus delta peptide. (A) EBOV glycoprotein editing. The GP gene can produce multiple versions of the protein due to differential RNA editing at
a conserved site containing seven uridine residues. All versions share the first 295 amino acid residues. Full-length GP, which is 676 amino acids, is produced
from mRNAs containing an additional nontemplated adenosine. Full-length GP is converted to GP1 and GP2 by cleavage at a furin-like protease-sensitive site
and is membrane anchored by a C-terminal membrane-spanning helix domain. sGP, which is produced from the unedited RNA transcript, contains only the
first 364 to 372 amino acids of the GP1 domain. The delta peptide, which is the frame-shifted C terminus of sGP, is cleaved from sGP in cells at an alternate
furin-like protease site created by the RNA editing. (B) Delta peptide sequences from Ebola virus and related filoviruses. The conserved C terminus is green,
except basic residues are blue, acidic residues are red, and cysteine is yellow. Aromatic residues are underlined. In the consensus sequence, a residue letter
indicates that at least 6 of the 7 sequences have the same residue, while a plus sign indicates a conserved physical chemistry. (C) HPLC chromatograms of
tryptophan fluorescence of Ebola virus delta peptide incubated in human serum for 1 to 24 h at 37°
C. At each time point, C-terminal biotinylated delta peptide
was extracted from serum using bead-immobilized streptavidin and released with 1 mM free biotin after extensive washing. The released peptide was eluted
from a reverse-phase C18 column developed in water/acetonitrile. The data are not corrected for the number of tryptophans; therefore, the 8- and 24-h
intensities per molecule are halved by the loss of tryptophan 18 by proteolysis. (D) Serum stability of E40ox after incubation with 10% human serum at 37°

 respectively) (Fig. 1B), as well as oxidized and reduced forms of the conserved 23-
residue C-terminal portion (E23ox and E23red). For comparison, we made the equivalent
full-length and C-terminal peptides from Reston virus (RESTV), a related filovirus that
causes high mortality in some nonhuman primates but apparently does not cause
disease in humans (22). Based on serum stability experiments, described below, we also
synthesized oxidized and reduced versions of the stable 17-, 15-, and 14-residue
C-terminal fragments of the Ebola virus delta peptide. For a positive control for
membrane lysis, we used MelP5, a synthetically evolved gain-of-function variant of the
cytolytic bee venom peptide melittin (23).
To determine if the delta peptide is biochemically stable in serum, we assessed the
resistance of oxidized delta peptide to proteolytic degradation in human serum. While
the N-terminal portion of E40ox is rapidly degraded in serum, disulfide cross-linked
C-terminal fragments between 27 and 14 residues long are resistant to serum prote-
olysis, as shown in Fig. 1C to E. Even after 24 h in serum, C-terminal fragments
containing 13 to 17 residues remained intact. It is thus reasonable to postulate that
delta peptides could have a role in human pathology of EVD and that this role could
be intracellular, extracellular, or both. Peptide sequences are shown schematically in
Fig. 2.
Permeabilization of cellular membranes. To assess permeabilization of mamma-
lian cells in culture, we measured the entry of Sytox green, a small, cationic, membrane-
impermeant DNA-binding dye that becomes fluorescent only if it is allowed to cross the
plasma membrane. In a few experiments, we also examined the efflux of calcein AM
ester red orange (CAMRO), a small anionic dye that is membrane impermeant once
activated by cytosolic esterases. In control samples, most cells exclude Sytox green and
retain CAMRO for hours. When cells are permeabilized, Sytox green enters and CAMRO
exits the cytosol (Fig. 3A).
Given the lack of long-term selective pressure in the rare human host prior to an EVD
outbreak, we hypothesized that if delta peptides contribute to disease pathology in
humans, they do so without highly sequence-specific interactions with human proteins.
To test this hypothesis, we measured membrane-permeabilizing activity in four nucle-
ated mammalian cell types; rodent (CHO), canine (MDCK), human (HeLa), and nonhu-
man primate (Vero) cells. Ebola virus is able to infect and propagate in the last two cell
types in the laboratory (24). When added to mammalian cells in culture, E40ox per-
meabilizes plasma membranes to Sytox green with a half-life (t1/2) of about 10 min (Fig.
3B) and with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 5 to 25 �M (Fig. 3C to F and Table
1). Cells from rodents, dogs, monkeys, and humans are all susceptible to delta peptide
permeabilization (Table 1). MDCK cells were the most susceptible, while Vero cells were
the least, but the total variation was small. For comparison, the highly potent cytolytic
peptide MelP5 permeabilized the same cells with a t1/2 of 10 min and an EC50 of 1 to
3 �M. Oxidized, truncated C-terminal delta peptides of 23, 17, and 15 residues were
similarly active (Fig. 3 and Table 1).
As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3, the oxidized 14-residue C-terminal variant, E14ox, is
inactive in all cell types. Because it shares many residues with and is treated identically
to the active variants, it serves as a negative control. Similarly, all the reduced delta
peptides studied (E40, E23, E17, E15, and E14) were essentially inactive in all cell types
(Table 1 and Fig. 3), providing additional negative controls. We conclude that the
cell-permeabilizing activity of the Ebola virus delta peptides (i) resides in the more
conserved C terminus of the sequence, (ii) is completely dependent on the disulfide
cross-linked C-terminal hairpin structure (Fig. 2), and (iii) is completely dependent on
the presence of the tryptophan that is 15 residues from the C terminus.
Oxidized Reston virus delta peptides, full-length R42ox and C-terminally truncated
R25ox, were less potent than E40ox and E23ox in these experiments (Table 1). E42ox had
little measurable activity, while R25ox had EC50 values, where tested, of 50 to 70 �M
compared to 10 to 20 �M for E23ox. The observations that the C-terminal fragment, R25,
contains the cell-permeabilizing activity and that its activity is lost upon reduction

 suggests that the RESTV delta peptide has a biological activity that is related to that of
the Ebola virus delta peptide. Similarly, the fact that 12 of 23 C-terminal residues (52%)
are identical between the two sequences and 18 of 23 residues (78%) are either
identical or very similar also suggests similar biological activity. The sequence differ-
ences do not suggest an obvious hypothesis as to why RESTV delta peptides were less
active than EBOV delta peptides in these experiments. However, we note that Sytox
green is a surrogate measurement for membrane permeabilization that may not
precisely mimic the biological activity.
We verified the cell permeabilization by EBOV delta peptides by measuring the
effects of E40 and E23 on transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) across a confluent
monolayer of MDCK cells. We observed that E40ox and E23ox, along with the MelP5
positive control, readily permeabilized cell monolayers, while E40red and E23red did not

 (Fig. 4A and Table 1). These results are consistent with permeabilization of cultured cells
to Sytox green.
We also measured the effects of delta peptides on longer timescales by measuring
cytotoxicity in Vero cells incubated with delta peptides for 24 h. The EC50s for cyto-
toxicity shown in Table 1 are similar to the values for acute permeabilization. This result
shows that delta peptide permeabilization exerts a significant long-term physiological
effect on cells, even at low concentrations. Permeabilization, as assayed by Sytox green
entry, is not a transient effect.
Pore size in membranes. When cultured mammalian cells are treated with the lytic
toxin MelP5, they swell rapidly, become spherical, and detach from cell culture surfaces,
consistent with an osmotic lysis mechanism driven by the formation of large, unre-
stricted membrane pores (25). In contrast, cells treated with oxidized delta peptides do
not swell dramatically and do not rapidly lose their shape or surface adherence (Fig. 3A
and 4C), suggesting that delta peptides form smaller and more selective pores. We
tested this hypothesis further by comparing Sytox green permeabilization of nucleated
cells to the release of hemoglobin from human erythrocytes (hemolysis). The latter
permeabilization process requires a substantial membrane pore that enables water
influx and osmotic lysis (26). The control peptide MelP5, which forms large pores (25),
permeabilizes nucleated cells and lyses erythrocytes with very similar, low-micromolar
EC50s of less than 4 �M. On the other hand, Ebola virus delta peptides, which permeab-
ilize nucleated cells to Sytox green at 5 to 25 �M, are essentially inactive against red
blood cells (RBC) in hemolysis assays up to 200 �M (Table 1 and Fig. 4B), indicating that
they form small pores that do not allow uncontrolled water influx. To further test the
hypothesis, we used confocal microscopy to study the peptide-induced entry of
macromolecules of 3, 10, and 38 kDa molecular mass into nucleated cells. MelP5 and
E23ox were tested in CHO cells at 2 times the EC50, or 6 and 30 �M, respectively, and
�95% of the cells were Sytox green positive in both cases (Table 1). At this concen-
tration, MelP5 readily enabled equilibration of all three macromolecules across the
plasma membranes of most cells (Fig. 4C and D). On the other hand, E23ox, at a peptide
concentration at which Sytox green and CAMRO readily permeate membranes, did not
allow entry of macromolecules into any cells, except for a small amount of entry of a
dextran that was only 3 kDa.
Permeabilization of synthetic bilayers. By measuring Sytox green entry into cells
from multiple animal species, we effectively tested the hypothesis that the biological
activity of the delta peptides is due to the peptide physical chemistry and is not

reduced peptides (red) do not. Except where noted, all measurements are based on Sytox green entry into cells after 1 h of incubation of serially diluted peptide
with a cell monolayer in the presence of 100 nM Sytox green. Sytox green entry, which does not occur in unperturbed cells, is measured by the dramatically
increased fluorescence of the probe when it binds to nuclear DNA (Fig. 3). I, less than 5% permeabilization was observed at the highest concentration studied, 200

 resistance, determined in this technique by the movement of monovalent ions across
the bilayer. Second, we measured leakage of the dye-quencher pair ANTS and DPX from
lipid vesicles, a phenomenon that requires membrane disturbances large enough to
release molecules with molecular masses of �350 Da. In impedance spectroscopy,
MelP5 is very potent (Fig. 5A and B), rapidly decreasing the resistance of planar lipid
bilayers to ions by more than 90% at a peptide-to-lipid (P/L) ratio of �1:1,000. E23ox is
also potent, with a similar 90% effect at a P/L ratio of �1:200. The P/L ratios that cause
50% leakage (LIC50 values) for MelP5 and E23ox are �1:10,000 and �1:2,000, respec-
tively (Fig. 5B and Table 2). Reduction of the delta peptide disulfide bond eliminated
the membrane-permeabilizing activity of the delta peptide, again supporting the
conclusion that disulfide cross-linked secondary structure is essential for activity. In
vesicle leakage experiments (Fig. 5C and D) we observed a revealing difference in
behavior compared to impedance spectroscopy. For dye release from zwitterionic PC
vesicles, the pore former MelP5 remains highly active, with LIC50 values of �1:3,000
(Fig. 5C,and Table 2). On the other hand, the delta peptides are substantially less active
compared to their potent effect on ionic resistance in supported bilayers. E23ox is the

equilibrium with the surface-supported bilayer. Resistance, in this experiment, is based on the movement of
monovalent ions, such as Na�, Cl�, H�, and OH–, or Ca2� and Mg2�, across the bilayer. (B) Fractional loss of
supported bilayer resistance versus peptide concentration. The values are for measurements made 60 min after
addition of peptide. (C and D) Lipid vesicle permeabilization. Large unilamellar vesicles were made by extrusion
from POPC (C) and POPC plus 50% POPG (D). Vesicles contained the dye ANTS (6 mM) and its quencher, DPX (12
mM). Peptide serial dilutions were added to 0.5 mM lipid vesicles in the wells of a 96-well plate. After 1 h, ANTS
fluorescence was measured, and fractional leakage was calculated relative to buffer only (0% leakage) and Triton
X-100 or MelP5 at a P/L ratio of 1:50 (100% leakage). The curves are fitted with a sigmoidal function to determine
EC50 from the curve midpoint.

 most active in PC vesicles, but its LIC50 value is 1:60. E40ox, E17ox, and E15ox also have
detectable activity against PC vesicles but have LIC50 values of �1:10 (Fig. 5C and Table
2). These results support the conclusion that the delta peptides form ion-permeable
pores, but not large pores, in zwitterionic membranes at low concentrations. At higher
concentrations, pores are able to release small molecules.
Some viroporins act on internal membranes (18, 19, 28), which have a larger amount
of anionic lipids than the plasma membrane, which has mostly zwitterionic lipids.
Therefore, we also measured the effects of anionic lipids on delta peptide activity
against lipid vesicles. When the vesicles contained 30% or 50% anionic phosphatidyl-
glycerol (PG), the activity of Ebola virus delta peptides increased dramatically, probably
due to better binding of the cationic peptides to the anionic bilayers. The LIC50 for
E23ox decreased 5-fold in the presence of 50% PG compared to PC vesicles, while the
LIC50 for E40ox and the other delta peptides decreased more than 200-fold (Table 2 and
Fig. 5D). Peptide activity increased with increasing PG content. Even reduced peptides
showed low activity against 50% PG-containing bilayers, suggesting that strong bind-
ing can drive delta peptides into a partially active conformation without the disulfide
cross-link. These results suggest that the potency of delta peptides for permeabilizing
internal cell membranes could be much higher than the potency we have measured
here for plasma membrane permeabilization.
Delta peptides are a conserved part of the EBOV life cycle. In cell culture, sGP
and delta peptide are produced by cells transfected with the wild-type EBOV GP RNA
(15). The delta peptide associates with cells but is also found in the cell culture
supernatant (15), where it is O-glycosylated, likely on threonine 5 and/or threonine 9
(Fig. 2). Radoshitzky and colleagues tested the effects of delta peptide-Fc domain
chimeras, added externally, on cell viability and on cell entry by Ebola, Reston, and
Marburg viruses or pseudoviruses (29). They noted no direct toxic effect on cells but
showed that the chimeras inhibited the entry of all filoviruses, including Marburg. The
RESTV delta peptide-Fc chimera did not block filovirus entry, suggesting that the Ebola
virus delta peptide has a unique or more potent activity, consistent with the observa-
tions we have made here. We have noted elsewhere (30) that many membrane-
interacting peptides inhibit the entry of enveloped viruses into cells. Thus, the reported
entry inhibition is consistent with the cell-permeabilizing activity that we report here.
Several studies have explored the effect of altering the 7U editing site in the GP
gene. In cell culture, recombinant EBOV, in which the editing site and sGP production
were eliminated by silent mutation, produced an increased amount of viral GP, and this
was linked to higher levels of cytotoxicity and reduced plaque size (31). The RNA-
editing site in the Ebola virus GP gene can also undergo rapid evolution, so its continued
presence in the viral genome indicates that it has an important functional role that is
subject to constant selection pressure. In Vero E6 cells in culture (32, 33), recombinant

 EBOV with an additional uridine at the editing site (EBOV/8U, which produces mostly
viral GP) appeared after passage and showed a distinct growth advantage over the
wild-type EBOV/7U. After 4 or 5 passages in Vero E6 cells, EBOV/8U replaced wild-type
EBOV/7U, suggesting that the production of sGP and delta peptide has a fitness cost in
cell culture that may exceed the cytotoxicity resulting from increased viral GP produc-
tion.
On the other hand, in guinea pigs (32) and in nonhuman primates (33, 34), EBOV/8U
quickly reverts to wild-type EBOV/7U, while EBOV/7U-infected animals retain the
EBOV/7U genotype. Thus, in vivo selection pressure in both rodents and primates
strongly favors EBOV/7U, the genotype that produces mostly sGP and delta peptide. A
significant amount of sequence data is available from the human outbreak of the
Makona variant of Ebola virus in West Africa (21, 35). These data show that the 7
consecutive uridines comprising the RNA-editing site in the GP gene (EBOV/7U) are the
dominant genotype in human patients at all stages of infection. The 8U genotype is
rarely found. Deep sequencing showed that 99% of mRNAs contained 7A, encoding
sGP and delta peptide, while only 1% of mRNAs were 8A, encoding the viral GP.
Ultimately, it is not possible, with current data, to decouple selection pressures on
delta peptide production from those on viral GP and on soluble-GP production. Animal
studies using viruses with genetically modified GP genes may be needed to address this
question. In any case, the genotype that is strongly favored in experimental animal
models and in human patients drives the production of delta peptide in large amounts.
Further, we have shown here that the active portions of the delta peptide are stable
indefinitely against proteolysis in human serum. The redox potential of extracellular
fluids strongly supports the formation and maintenance of oxidized disulfide bonds
(36). Thus, if delta peptides act extracellularly, they will persist for long periods in the
extracellular space and will probably remain locally concentrated in viremic tissues due
to cell binding. If delta peptides act intracellularly, they will likely also be stable against
cytosolic proteolysis.
Plasma concentrations of delta peptide are unknown; however, plasma concentra-
tions of 34 �g/ml (�1 �M) sGP in Guinea pigs have been reported, and the amount
increases during infection (37). This observation supports the idea that large amounts
of sGP and delta peptide are produced. Furthermore, the delta peptide is not likely to
be homogeneously distributed. It binds strongly to cells and likely remains concen-
trated in tissues with an abundance of infected cells, at least for some time. Thus, local
concentration (for example, in the intestinal tract epithelia) could easily reach tens of
micromoles or higher. Furthermore, delta peptides may act intracellularly, where their
local concentration would clearly be high enough to observe the effects we report here.
EBOV delta peptide is a viroporin. Whether they act intracellularly or extracellu-
larly, our results support the hypothesis (16) that Ebola virus delta peptides are
viroporins, nonstructural virus-encoded proteins that permeabilize cellular or viral
membranes. Well-described viroporins are known from influenza virus, HIV, picornavi-
ruses, rotaviruses, coronaviruses, and others, while putative viroporins have been
reported for many other viruses (18, 19, 38–40). Viroporins can act intracellularly to
permeabilize organelle membranes (41), modulate calcium homeostasis (42), alter
organelle acidification (43), induce autophagy (44), and otherwise “customize host cells
for efficient viral propagation” (41). Other viroporins may act extracellularly and per-
meabilize infected or noninfected cells (18). Here, we show that the delta peptides of
Ebola virus are viroporins that indiscriminately permeabilize mammalian cell plasma
membranes at micromolar concentrations by altering permeation of ionic compounds
and small molecules. This type of behavior has been well described for some viroporins,
including the NSP4 enterotoxic viroporin from rotavirus, which increases the ionic
permeability of cell membranes without acute lysis (45). Even a small disruption of the
ionic permeability of cell membranes is sufficient to disrupt cell function (45) and
contribute to viral pathology through intracellular or extracellular effects. Although
much remains to be learned, we hypothesize that Ebola virus delta peptides may act on

 multiple timescales. First, on the shortest time scale of minutes to hours, the permea-
bilization of cell membranes will cause disruption of cell function by processes such as
dissipation of ion gradients or influx of divalent cations. On longer timescales, even low
levels of continuous membrane disruption will lead to cell death.
Finally, we speculate that the viroporin activity of the Ebola virus delta peptide could
give it enterotoxic activity. This activity, which would be similar to the activity of the
NSP4 enterotoxic viroporin of rotavirus, could be associated with the severe gastroin-
testinal illness experienced by EVD patients. The resulting vomiting and diarrhea could,
in turn, be related to the high efficiency of the Ebola virus Makona variant in spreading
to the physical contacts of infected patients (8), including especially family and health
care workers. If this speculation is correct, then the viroporin activity of the Ebola virus
delta peptide could be a critical, and targetable, part of Ebola virus disease pathology
in humans.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Peptides. All peptides were synthesized by Bio-Synthesis, Inc. Purity and identity were verified
with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry and reverse-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To oxidize the disulfide bond, peptides were
dissolved at �1 mg/ml in 0.025% acetic acid, followed by addition of 20% (vol/vol) dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) for 24 h to drive oxidation. Successful oxidation (�95%) and lack of intermolecular
cross-links (�5%) were verified with reverse-phase HPLC. Oxidized and reduced peptides, as well as
cross-linked multimers, have unique retention times. After oxidation, water and DMSO were re-
moved under high vacuum, and a concentrated peptide stock was made by redissolving in buffer.
Serum stability. E40ox with a C-terminal lysine-biotin residue was incubated at 50 �M with 10%
non-heat-treated human serum for 1, 8, and 24 h at 37°
C with mixing. The biotinylated peptide was then
pulled down with an excess of resin-immobilized streptavidin. After extensive washing of the resin, 1 mM
free biotin was added to release biotinylated delta peptide. The collected material was subjected to
reverse-phase HPLC and MALDI mass spectrometry. By HPLC and MALDI, mock samples with no delta
peptide, but treated identically, contained no detectable peptides. Delta peptide-containing samples
showed a cluster of overlapping peaks on HPLC, which corresponded to a cluster of distinct masses on
MALDI. Each peak corresponded closely to a potassium adduct of an expected delta peptide fragment.
Further, since the fragments were clustered in the 14- to 20-residue range and differed by 1 or 2 residues,
peak identification was verified by stepwise sequencing of the peak cluster.
Cell permeation. Cells were seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates and grown to 80 to 90%
confluence for 24 to 48 h in full medium. The growth medium was then exchanged for medium lacking
fetal bovine serum (FBS) for assays. In a few experiments, 15 min before the addition of peptide, cells
were incubated with 1 �M CAMRO for 10 min, followed by washing and replacement of medium. At this
point, the cell cytosol was brightly fluorescent. Five minutes before the assay, 100 nM Sytox green was
added. Peptides were first serially diluted and then added to the cells at time zero. The Sytox intensity
in each well was measured every 5 min for at least 1 h. Sytox green fluorescence at 60 min was used to
calculate fractional permeabilization of the plasma membrane.
Cytotoxicity. Vero green monkey cells were grown in 96-well plates as described above. Serially
diluted peptide was added, and the cells were incubated at 37°
C for 24 h. At that time, 100 nM
alamarBlue was added, and any live cells were given 4 h to convert it to the fluorescent product, which
was measured in a Biotek Synergy plate reader. The controls for 0% and 100% viability were medium only
without cells and cells with no peptide, respectively.
TEER. MDCKII cells were seeded on collagen I-coated polyester transwells after a 1.5-h preincubation
with medium to fill the transwell membrane pores, as described previously (46), and cultured for 3 days
with the medium changed daily. On the day of the experiment, the cells were washed, incubated in fresh
medium for 2 h, and then washed and incubated with 1� CMPBS (1� phosphate-buffered saline [PBS],
0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.75 mM CaCl2) for 40 min. Peptides, diluted in 1� CMPBS in LoBind Eppendorf tubes,
were added to the apical compartment, and the cells were incubated at 37°
C and 5% CO2 for 1 h.
Following replacement of the peptide solution with CMPBS, the TEER was measured with an EVOM-2 m
and Endohm-6 chamber made by World Precision Instruments. TEER is expressed as the difference in
resistance between the cell monolayer and blank wells. The effect of peptide is expressed as a fractional
loss of TEER 1 h after the addition of peptide.
Hemolysis. Fresh human red blood cells were obtained from Interstate Blood Bank, Inc., and
thoroughly washed with PBS until the supernatant was clear. To measure hemolysis, serial dilutions of
peptide were prepared and added to 2 � 108 RBC/ml. After incubation for 1 h at 37°
C, the cells were
centrifuged, and the released hemoglobin was measured by optical absorbance of the heme group (410
nm). The negative control was buffer only (0% lysis), and the positive control was distilled water (100%
lysis).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Impedance measurements were made using a three-
electrode system with a silver/silver chloride reference electrode and a platinum counterelectrode.
Experimental details were published previously (47). The physisorbed bottom monolayer was made from
1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) with 5% polyethylene glycol 2000 (PEG-2000)
lipids. The upper monolayer was formed by fusion with pure POPC vesicles. The impedance was

 measured over the frequency range from 105 to 1 Hz using a 20-mV alternating perturbation. The
potential was 0 V with respect to the reference electrode. Spectra were recorded at 2-min intervals and
fitted to an equivalent circuit model to determine the values of resistance and capacitance of the
semiconductor-liquid interface and the bilayer membrane.
Vesicle permeabilization. Large unilamellar vesicles were made by extrusion from POPC and, in
some experiments, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG). Vesicles contained the
dye ANTS (6 mM) and its quencher, DPX (12 mM), in 10 mM phosphate buffer as described previously
(48). The external solution contained equimolar NaCl at 40 mM in 10 mM phosphate buffer. Peptide serial
dilutions were made in LoBind Eppendorf tubes, followed by addition to 0.5 mM lipid vesicles in the wells
of a 96-well plate. After 1 h, ANTS fluorescence was measured on a Biotek Synergy plate reader. Fractional
leakage was calculated relative to buffer only (0% leakage) and Triton X-100 or MelP5 at a P/L ratio of
1:100 (100% leakage).
