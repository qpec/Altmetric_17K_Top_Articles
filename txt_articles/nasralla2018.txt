Preservation in europe
Liver transplantation is a highly successful treatment, but is severely limited by the shortage in donor organs. However, 
many potential donor organs cannot be used; this is because sub-optimal livers do not tolerate conventional cold storage 
and there is no reliable way to assess organ viability preoperatively. Normothermic machine perfusion maintains the liver 
in a physiological state, avoids cooling and allows recovery and functional testing. Here we show that, in a randomized trial 
with 220 liver transplantations, compared to conventional static cold storage, normothermic preservation is associated 
with a 50% lower level of graft injury, measured by hepatocellular enzyme release, despite a 50% lower rate of organ 
discard and a 54% longer mean preservation time. There was no significant difference in bile duct complications, graft 
survival or survival of the patient. If translated to clinical practice, these results would have a major impact on liver 
transplant outcomes and waiting list mortality.
Liver transplantation is the accepted treatment for end-stage liver 
failure, with one and five year survivals in excess of 90% and 70%, 
respectively1. With increasing rates of liver disease2, the supply of 
transplantable organs is no longer able to meet demand. Paradoxically, 
despite substantial waiting list mortality (for example, 21% in the UK), 
only 63% of UK deceased donor livers are transplanted1. Increasing 
numbers of deceased organ donors in many countries have not been 
matched by a corresponding rise in the number of transplantable 
organs. This is mainly because these additional donors tend to be 
high-risk—either declared dead by cardiovascular criteria (DCD), as 
opposed to brainstem death donors (DBD), or elderly with multiple 
co-morbidities (extended criteria donors). Such organs pose a greater 
risk to the recipient, with a higher probability that the liver will never 
function (primary non-function (PNF)) or that it will lead to later com-
plications, particularly biliary stricturing.
Despite many advances in liver transplantation, the method of 
organ preservation has changed very little in almost 30 years3. The 
liver is flushed and cooled with specialist preservation fluid, then 
stored in an icebox. This process of static cold storage (SCS) has 
 
several limitations. Although SCS slows metabolism by 10- to 12-fold, 
substantial anaerobic activity continues even at ice temperature4. 
This leads to ATP depletion and accumulation of succinate and other 
metabolites. These lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species5 
that are the basis of ischaemia–reperfusion injury, when the organ 
 
is re-exposed to oxygenated blood at the time of transplantation. 
 
This damage, exacerbated by any prior injury, limits the maximum safe 
preservation time of the donor organ. Once cooled, the cessation of 
normal cellular activity also makes functional assessment impossible.
These shortcomings are particularly problematic in the higher-risk 
donor organs that form an increasing proportion of current liver 
transplant practice. The very severe ischaemia–reperfusion-related 
morbidity that characterizes transplantation of such organs is now a 
major limitation in meeting the demand for life-saving transplants. To 
combat the limitations imposed by cold storage, a change in preser-
vation technology is required. In recent years, interest has developed 
in perfusion at physiological temperature (normothermic machine 
perfusion (NMP))6–9.
During NMP, the liver is perfused with oxygenated blood, med-
ications and nutrients at normal body temperature to maintain a 
physiological milieu. Evidence from animal models of both DBD 
and DCD liver transplantation10,11 suggests that this improves 
the post-transplant survival of transplanted livers, and potentially 
 
enables the assessment of organ viability during preservation. The 
mechanism underlying these improved outcomes is at least partly 
related to the metabolic resuscitation of the organ that occurs with 
preservation under physiological conditions. This has been demon-
strated through the replenishment of ATP levels11, which in turn con-
tributes to a reduction in the severity of the ischaemia–reperfusion 
injury that is experienced after transplant5,10.
There is increasing interest in the clinical application of NMP, with 
several cases described in the recent literature6,7. In 2013, a phase-I 
study by our group9, demonstrated the safety and feasibility of NMP in

20 liver transplant recipients. This was used as the precursor to the pres-
ent study which, to our knowledge, is the first randomized controlled 
trial to test the efficacy of machine perfusion against conventional cold 
storage in liver transplantation.
Livers from adult DBD or DCD donors were eligible for enrolment. 
Adult patients awaiting a liver-only transplant, excluding those with 
fulminant liver failure, were eligible. If a suitable liver was allocated 
to a consented recipient, the liver was randomized to either conven-
tional SCS or NMP. In the SCS arm, the organ retrieval, storage and 
the transplant were conducted according to standard practice. In the 
NMP arm, following removal from the donor, the liver was attached to 
the OrganOx metra NMP device, where it was perfused throughout the 
duration of preservation (Fig. 1), until the transplanting surgeon was 
ready to implant it, at which point it was removed from the device. The 
remainder of the recipient’s care followed standard practice.
Daily during the first postoperative week, and at day 10, day 30, 
month 6 and month 12, biochemical results were recorded as well as 
graft and patient survival data. At six months, a magnetic resonance 
imaging scan of the biliary tree (MRCP) was performed to assess evi-
dence of biliary injury. Biological samples were collected and stored in 
a biobank from each liver and recipient enrolled in the study, for use 
in further mechanistic studies.
The primary endpoint was defined as the difference between the two 
treatment arms in the peak level of serum aspartate transaminase (AST) 
within seven days after transplant. This hepatocellular enzyme is a clini-
cally accepted biomarker, predictive of graft and patient survival12.
Recruitment
Between 26 June 2014 and 8 March 2016, 334 livers were randomized, 
with 64 livers subsequently excluded (Fig. 2). Following organ retrieval, 
a markedly different discard rate between the two trial arms resulted in 
100 SCS and 120 NMP livers available for primary outcome reporting, 
with 101 SCS and 121 NMP livers available for secondary outcome anal-
ysis. This discrepancy in group size reduced the study power to 89.7%.
One NMP liver was cold stored due to an accessory left hepatic artery 
arising from the aorta preventing effective cannulation. Eight NMP 
livers received machine perfusion for less than four hours (for logistic 
rather than technical reasons). All of these organs are included in the 
NMP arm as part of the modified intention to treat analysis. For the 
per protocol sensitivity analysis, the eight livers perfused for less than 
four hours were excluded and the single NMP liver that was preserved 
using SCS was reassigned to the SCS group.
Donor, preservation and recipient characteristics
NMP and SCS donor and recipient groups were well-matched (Tables 1, 2). 
 
The discard rate was higher in the SCS arm (24.1%; 32 out of 133) 
than the NMP arm (11.7%; 16 out of 137; Extended Data Table 1). 
This difference was statistically significant (−
12.4%, 95% confidence 
interval −
21.4 to −
3.3%; P = 0.008). One NMP discard was the result 
of a device malfunction in an already marginal organ (hepatic artery 
hypoperfusion due to pinch valve miscalibration; see Supplementary 
Information).
Functional warm ischaemia time applies only to DCD livers and was 
measured as the time from the onset of donor hypoxia (oxygen satu-
ration < 70%) or hypoperfusion (systolic blood pressure < 50 mmHg) 
until the start of cold aortic perfusion in the donor. The median 
functional warm ischaemia time was longer for NMP than SCS livers 
(21 min versus 16 min; P = 0.003).
Total preservation time was measured from the start of cold aortic 
 
perfusion in the donor until graft reperfusion in the recipient. The 
median total preservation time was longer for NMP than SCS liv-
ers (11 h 54 min versus 7 h 45 min; P < 0.001). Within the NMP 
arm, there was no significant difference in median perfusion time 
between DBD and DCD livers (9 h 55 min DBD versus 8 h 45 min 
DCD; P = 0.449).
Post-reperfusion haemodynamics were documented in 218 cases: 
post-reperfusion syndrome was more common in the SCS (32 out of 
97) than the NMP group (15 out of 121), a statistically significant dif-
ference (–20.6%, 95% confidence interval –31.6 to –9.5%; P < 0.001). 
This was despite reduced requirement for vasopressors in NMP livers 
in the post-reperfusion period (Extended Data Table 2a–c).

Peak AST (primary outcome)
Peak AST during the first 7 days after transplant was reduced by 49.4% 
in the NMP group compared to SCS when adjusted by centre and donor 
type (geometric mean ratio 0.506, 95% confidence interval 0.388–0.659; 
P < 0.001). Unadjusted analysis (Student’s t-test) and sensitivity analysis 
undertaken in the per-protocol population confirmed these results.
Subgroup analysis showed that the effect of NMP was different in 
the two donor types (test for interaction P = 0.012), although it was 
statistically significant in both subgroups; the reduction in geometric 
mean peak AST was greater in DCD (73.3%, 95% confidence interval 
53.7–84.6%; P < 0.001) than in DBD livers (40.2%, 95% confidence 
interval 19.3–55.7%; P = 0.001). Subgroup analyses for the model for 
end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and Eurotransplant-donor risk 
index (ET-DRI) showed no statistically significant differences (data not 
shown). See Extended Data Table 3a, b and Extended Data Fig. 1 for 
further analysis. See Table 3 for full outcome results.
Early allograft dysfunction
Data to assess early allograft dysfunction (EAD) rates were available in 
216 recipients: the odds of developing EAD in the NMP arm (12 out of 
119) were 74% lower than the SCS arm (29 out of 97; odds ratio 0.263, 
95% confidence interval 0.126–0.550; P < 0.001). A logistic regression 
model adjusted for donor type, MELD score and ET-DRI showed that 
the adjusted odds of EAD in the NMP arm were approximately 72% 
lower than in the cold storage arm (adjusted odds ratio 0.276, 95% 
confidence interval 0.124–0.611; P = 0.002). The difference in EAD 
rates was partly a result of the difference in peak AST (described above), 
but also a reflection of differences in bilirubin. The median bilirubin 
level in the first week postoperatively was lower in NMP recipients 
(2.25 mg dl−
1, 95% confidence interval 1.23–4.28)) than in the SCS 
group (2.87 mg dl−
1, 95% confidence interval 1.52–5.00; P = 0.029).
Biliary strictures on MRCP
An MRCP was performed on 155 (81 NMP, 74 SCS) of the 222 trans-
planted trial patients. There was no significant difference in the rate of 
non-anastomotic strictures for DBD (NMP 7.4% (4 out of 54) versus SCS 
5.4% (3 out of 55); P = 0.678) or DCD (NMP 11.1% (3 out of 27) versus 
SCS 26.3% (5 out of 19); P = 0.180) livers. Only one patient in each trial 
arm developed clinically relevant evidence of ischaemic cholangiopathy 
in the first year after transplant, both of whom were re-transplanted.

Similarly, there was no significant difference in the rate of anasto-
motic strictures for DBD (NMP 40.7% (22 out of 54) versus SCS 41.8% 
(23 out of 55); P = 0.909) or DCD (NMP 48.1% (13 out of 27) versus 
SCS 57.9% (11 out of 19); P = 0.515) livers.
Hospital stay, graft and patient survival
There was no difference in median intensive care unit (ICU) stay 
 
(4 days NMP versus 4 days SCS; P = 0.339), hospital stay (15 days NMP 
versus 15 days SCS; P = 0.926) or the need for renal replacement therapy 
 
in the first postoperative week (2.7%, 95% confidence interval –7.9 to 
13.2%; P = 0.621).
One NMP liver developed PNF (see Supplementary Information). 
There were no PNF cases in the SCS arm. Overall 10 recipients died 
during follow-up, producing a one-year survival of 0.949 (95% confi-
dence interval 0.890–0.977) in the NMP group and 0.958 (95% confi-
dence interval 0.902–0.982) in the SCS group (P = 0.901). Two deaths 
in the SCS group and three deaths in the NMP group were due to graft 
failure.
Graft survival at one year was 0.950 (95% confidence interval 0.893–
0.977) and 0.960 (95% confidence interval 0.897–0.985) in the NMP 
and SCS groups, respectively (P = 0.695). The causes of graft failure 
in the SCS arm were hepatic artery thrombosis (n = 3) and ischaemic 
cholangiopathy (n = 1). The causes of graft failure in the NMP arm were 
hepatic artery thrombosis (n = 2), ischaemic cholangiopathy (n = 1), 
non-thrombotic infarction (n = 1), inferior vena cava occlusion (n = 1) 
and PNF (n = 1). (Extended Data Fig. 2a, b).

Perfusion characteristics indicative of organ quality
The following continuously monitored parameters (mean ± s.d.) by the 
third hour of NMP were measured for all livers that went on to be suc-
cessfully transplanted (Extended Data Figs. 3, 4). The measured haemo-
dynamic parameters were: hepatic artery flow (280 ± 120 ml min−
1) 
and portal vein flow (1.11 ± 0.2 l min−
1). The measured meta-
bolic parameters were: pH (7.31 ± 0.17) and lactate clearance from 
9.99 ± 3.13 mmol l−
1 at 15 min NMP to 0.93 ± 0.63 mmol l−
1 by 4 h 
NMP. The measured synthetic parameter consisted of bile production 
(9.17 ± 11.16 ml h−
1). Notably, 18 transplanted NMP livers produced 
no/minimal bile during perfusion. All but one of these functioned 
after transplant. There was no correlation between bile production and 
post-transplant liver function or later development of non-anastomotic 
biliary strictures.
One NMP liver developed PNF. This liver was persistently acidotic 
with lactate > 4 mmol for the duration of NMP. No other liver with 
these characteristics was transplanted.
Following transplant, 28 livers displayed minimal preservation 
injury (MPI; peak AST < 250 IU l−
1) and 25 showed evidence of 
severe preservation injury (SPI; peak AST > 1,000 IU l−
1). The donors 
in these groups were well-matched in all characteristics other than 
sex (Extended Data Table 4). During NMP, there was a difference in 
baseline perfusate alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (MPI 171 IU l−
1 
versus SPI 669 IU l−
1; P = 0.005) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
(MPI 1,073 IU l−
1 versus SPI 1,838 IU l−
1; P = 0.01) between the two 
groups. Levels of these enzymes, as well as γ
-glutamyltransferase (γ
GT), 
increased more rapidly during the first 8 h of NMP in the SPI group 
(ALT, an increase of 56 IU l−
1 versus an increase of 461 IU l−
1, P < 0.001; 
LDH, an increase of 483 IU l−
1 versus an increase of 980 IU l−
1, 
 
P = 0.06; γ
GT, an increase of 23 IU l−
1 versus increase of 104 IU l−
1, 
 
P = 0.004). MPI livers showed a reduction in measurable levels of 
haemolysis (haemolysis index) as NMP progressed, in contrast to SPI 
livers in which the levels of haemolysis rose (MPI, a decrease of 0.04 U 
versus SPI, an increase of 0.09 U; P = 0.03). Bile production was greater 
in the MPI group (MPI 13.1 ml h−
1 versus SPI 7.8 ml h−
1; P = 0.03). 
Lactate clearance was similar in each group. Post-reperfusion syndrome 
was less common in the MPI group (MPI 0% (0 out of 28) versus SPI 
24% (6 out of 25); P = 0.007). One NMP liver with perfusate transami-
nases in excess of 20,000 IU l−
1 was transplanted successfully.
Adverse events
The proportion of patients for whom adverse events were reported 
(Extended Data Tables 5a–c, 6) was similar in the two arms (55.4% 
NMP, 95% confidence interval 46.1–64.4% versus 57.4% SCS, 95% 
confidence interval, 47.2–67.2%) with a larger total number of events 
reported for SCS livers (128 NMP versus 164 SCS). Of these, a greater 
proportion of the serious adverse events (Clavien–Dindo grade ≥
IIIb) 
were in the SCS than NMP arm (16.4% NMP (21 out of 128) versus 
22% SCS (36 out of 164)). No statistical tests were applied to these data.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial to com-
pare any type of machine perfusion technology with conventional static 
cold storage in human liver transplantation.
The trial demonstrated significant reductions in peak AST and EAD 
rates in NMP livers; this is of clinical relevance as both are clinically 
accepted biomarkers for long-term graft and patient survival12,13. 
These benefits are consistent with previous animal work10 and the 
phase-I clinical study9 that preceded this trial, both of which showed 
post-transplant AST reductions in NMP livers. No differences were 
seen in graft or patient survival: a much larger trial is required to test 
this outcome. It is notable that these reductions in peak AST and EAD 
rates were achieved in the context of improved organ utilization and 
longer preservation times, both of which have implications in terms 
of addressing the donor shortage and logistical barriers that currently 
limit liver transplants.
DCD donors represent a largely untapped source of organs, com-
prising 42% of UK deceased donors, but only 21% of transplanted 
 
livers14. Utilization of DCD livers is limited by poorer outcomes (PNF 
and ischaemic cholangiopathy) compared with DBD livers. Allowing 
the limitations of small group analyses, in this study NMP DCD liver 
primary outcome data were superior to those of both DCD and DBD 
livers preserved using SCS. In fact, the primary outcome of DCD NMP 
livers was superior to that of DBD livers preserved by NMP: this was 
possibly owing to a selection bias, both of donors (lower threshold 
to decline DCD donors) and recipients (fitter patients selected for 
higher-risk organs). The AST differences are in the context of longer 
functional warm ischaemia times, longer preservation times and fewer 
organ discards in the NMP arm, suggesting that NMP may be achieving 
the desired objective of increasing organ utilization without compro-
mising outcome. If these findings were translated into clinical practice, 
the increase in organ utilization would have substantial implications 
for waiting list mortality, which is currently approximately one in five 
patients1.
The longer preservation times in the NMP group were not planned, 
but were all within the maximum perfusion time defined in the pro-
tocol. There was no stipulation in the trial protocol that the preser-
vation times should be matched. As clinicians gained experience, it 
appeared that some centres had started to organize their operating 
schedule according to the preservation method, although no overall 
difference between arms was seen in the proportion of transplants 
occurring in daylight hours. If, as appears to be the case, NMP can 
safely extend preservation times without compromising outcomes, this 
will have implications for operating department planning as well as 
organ utilization.
There were over 50% fewer discarded organs in the NMP group, 
resulting in 20% more transplanted livers (121 NMP versus 101 SCS). 
The SCS discard rate of 23.7% was higher than the 17% reported in 
UK registry data14, and may reflect the high proportion of DCD livers 
enrolled in the trial; the discard rate of retrieved DCD livers in the UK 
is 30%14. This reported difference in organ utilization is likely to be an 
underestimation of the full potential impact that NMP could have on 
transplant numbers. The trial stipulated that only livers considered 
transplantable according to standard practice could be enrolled. For 
the full extent of improved organ utilization to be measured, livers 
would need to be randomized to NMP or SCS before being offered for 
transplant; this should form the basis of a future study. An increase of 
20% or more in the number of transplantable donor livers would have 
a transformative effect on the mortality on liver transplant waiting lists 
around the world.
The haemodynamic characteristics of the NMP recipients following 
reperfusion were measurably superior to those of SCS recipients, in line 
with previously reported findings15. This did not translate into a differ-
ence in ICU stay, hospital stay or need for renal replacement therapy 
between the two groups, despite previous reports showing a correlation 
between peak AST and renal replacement therapy16. The magnitude of 
the reperfusion syndrome is a factor in determining the eligibility of the 
sickest patients for high-risk organs, due to the limited capacity of such 
patients to tolerate cardiovascular instability; NMP might therefore 
increase the options for the most urgent patients.
Perhaps the greatest limitation to more widespread utilization of 
DCD livers is the high rate of clinically important non-anastomotic 
biliary strictures (NAS) which lead to a high rate of graft failure; this 
is believed to develop due to the vulnerability of the biliary tree to 
prolonged warm ischaemia. The rate of NAS in the NMP DCD group 
(11.1%) was lower than in SCS (26.3%) livers, despite longer functional 
warm ischaemia times. This did not reach statistical significance, which 
may be a function of sample size; the trial was not powered for this 
outcome. Reported rates of NAS in DCD transplants vary from 10 
to 30%17,18, but these are in patients with symptoms suggesting bil-
iary pathology, rather than those only apparent on imaging; biliary

investigations are usually only performed for clinical indications 
(typically deranged liver function). Prior to this study, the radiolog-
ical incidence of both anastomotic and non-anastomotic strictures in 
asymptomatic patients was unknown; in particular, there is no real 
benchmark against which to compare the rate of NAS seen in the DCD 
SCS group. Apart from the two patients retransplanted for ischaemic 
cholangiopathy, almost all of the remaining patients with radiological 
evidence of NAS had normal liver function at one year; this questions 
the clinical relevance of a protocol MRCP at six months. The longer-
term follow-up of these patients will shed light on the importance of 
a radiological diagnosis of biliary stricturing in patients with normal 
graft function, and the role of MRCP as an endpoint in future trials.
As well as demonstrating improved graft preservation, this trial 
tested the feasibility, usability and safety of NMP, a vital component of 
the evaluation of any new technology. It showed that the logistical chal-
lenges of NMP can be met successfully within clinical practice. Over 
120 NMP livers were transplanted in seven transplant centres across 
four European countries. Nonetheless, adoption of this technology 
 
into clinical practice may necessitate changes in the organ retrieval 
process, particularly with respect to technical support and transport 
arrangements. It remains to be seen whether NMP is required for the 
full duration of an organ’s preservation or can equally well be applied 
after a short period of SCS when the organ reaches the transplanting 
centre—this would simplify the logistics but may not be suitable for 
the most marginal organs19. A phase-II study to test this has recently 
completed enrolment in the UK (NCT03176433).
For this new technology to be supported by healthcare funders, a 
health–economic case is needed. The results of this study suggest that 
benefits will accrue not only from improved early graft function and 
transplantation logistics, but also from improved utilization. Secondary 
economic benefits will accrue from logistic changes, enabling trans-
plants to be moved predominantly into daytime operating, with reduc-
tion in staffing costs and likely improvements in outcome. More timely 
intervention will also bring economic benefits—earlier transplantation 
is associated with lower morbidity and cost.
The effects of NMP demonstrated in this study are unequivocal with 
respect to the primary endpoint, implying a benefit in livers currently 
used for transplantation. However, the greatest benefit may be realized 
by applying this technology to livers outside current acceptance crite-
ria, in order to transplant organs currently deemed untransplantable. 
Algorithms to assess organ viability, based on data obtained during 
NMP, will be essential if this potential is to be realized10. This study 
sheds some light on which perfusion parameters may be used to assess 
organ quality: bile production, acid–base stability, lactate clearance, 
perfusate transaminase levels, falling measurable haemolysis—all 
correlate with the degree of preservation injury evident after trans-
plant. However, all but one of the livers transplanted in the NMP group 
functioned postoperatively, including one NMP liver with perfusate 
transaminases in excess of 20,000 IU l−
1 and 18 livers with minimal 
bile production. Data from much larger numbers of NMP transplants 
(typically from a registry) would be required to determine specific 
markers of viability.
The importance of bile production during NMP is unclear. 
Preliminary evidence from our group20 suggests that preservation 
injury causes impaired hepatocellular uptake of bile salts. We have 
shown evidence of progressive accumulation of bile salts in the perfu-
sate of livers with high post-transplant transaminase levels; something 
that also correlates with poor bile production during NMP. The extent 
and nature of the injury required to produce this effect is not clear but 
does appear to reflect organ quality rather than viability.
High-risk organs (for example, those with steatosis) may benefit from 
therapeutic interventions delivered during NMP: several groups are 
exploring potential strategies, including stem cell treatments, de-fatting 
 
agents and immunological modification of the organ. Future trials 
may be needed to formally test the size of the effect of NMP on organ 
 
utilization; for this it will be necessary to randomize livers at the time 
of organ offering rather than the time of retrieval. Organ utilization, or 
organ utilization with 12-month graft survival (functional utilization) 
would be a logical primary endpoint for a study of this sort.
This study describes the formal clinical evaluation of a novel tech-
nology in liver transplantation, and could herald the start of a new era 
of intervention during organ preservation. It represents a first, neces-
sary step in demonstrating that NMP is feasible, safe and effective in 
clinical practice; the fact that the study has definitively met its primary 
endpoint should now enable the exploration of the technology’s wider 
potential.

Study design. This investigator-led, multinational, open-label, two-arm, paral-
lel randomized controlled trial included seven liver transplant centres from the 
UK (Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge; King’s College Hospital, London; 
Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham; Royal Free Hospital, London), Belgium 
(Universitaire Ziekenhuizen, Leuven), Spain (Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, 
Barcelona) and Germany (Universitatsklinikum, Essen), and was part of the 
EU-funded Consortium for Organ Preservation in Europe (COPE, http://www.
cope-eu.org/). Approval was obtained from national research ethics commit-
tees and medical device regulatory bodies in each trial region, in particular the 
London–Dulwich National Research Ethics Committee (NREC) and the Medicines 
and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK; the Federaal Agentschap 
voor Geneesmiddelen en Gezondheidsproducten (FAGG) and the Commissie 
Medische Ethiek of Universitaire Ziekenhuizen, Leuven, Belgium; the Comité 
Ético de Investigación Clínica of the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona; the Deutsche 
Ärztekammer and the ethics committee of University Hospital Essen, Germany. 
The trial protocol was registered before recruitment (ISRCTN 39731134). All rel-
evant ethical regulations relating to the conduct of this study were followed at 
each trial site. The trial is reported in accordance with the CONSORT statement21.
No major amendments were made to the trial design after the start of recruit-
ment.
Eligibility and consent. Inclusion criteria for donors and recipients were deliber-
ately broad to represent the full spectrum of clinical practice. Whole livers from 
DBD and DCD (Maastricht category III22) donors at least 16 years of age were 
eligible. Specific donor consent was not required for trial inclusion. No organs 
were procured from prisoners. Recipients were eligible provided they were at least 
18 years old and listed for a liver-only transplant, excluding those with fulminant 
liver failure, owing to the poor prognosis of this group regardless of organ quality. 
 
Potential participants were consented while on the waiting list; consent was 
affirmed on the day of transplantation. The consent included the recording of 
anonymized data for trial purposes and the collection of biological samples for 
storage in the trial biobank (see ‘Sample collection’). No patient identifiable data 
were collected.
Randomization. Once an eligible donor organ was allocated to a consented recip-
ient and the availability of the NMP device and team was confirmed, the liver 
was randomized. All clinical decisions thereafter, including graft suitability and 
procedure scheduling, were made independently of the trial team.
Using an online randomization tool, livers were assigned to NMP or SCS with 
1:1 allocation ratio as per a computer-generated randomization schedule, using 
variable block size, stratified by transplant centre and donor type (DBD/DCD). 
The unit of randomization was donor livers rather than recipients, but analysis is 
reported for the transplant recipients.
Static cold storage group. Livers randomized to SCS were retrieved, preserved, 
transported and transplanted according to local standard practice.
Normothermic machine perfusion group. The OrganOx metra normothermic 
liver perfusion device was used (Extended Data Fig. 5a), which enables automated 
organ preservation for up to 24 h. Following randomization to NMP, the device and 
accompanying researcher were transported to the donor hospital. The device was 
set-up during the retrieval procedure, as has been previously described9. A sterile 
disposable set was installed on to the device and primed with 500 ml gelofusine 
 
(B. Braun Ltd) and three units of donor-matched packed red blood cells. Antibiotics 
were given at the outset and heparin, insulin, prostacyclin, bile salts and fat-free 
parenteral nutrition were infused during the perfusion (Extended Data Fig. 5b).
Following retrieval of the donor organ, and while still at the donor hospital, the 
liver back-table operation was performed23, followed by cannulation of the hepatic 
artery, portal vein, inferior vena cava and bile duct. The liver was connected to the 
NMP device and perfusion commenced (Fig. 1). During the early part of the per-
fusion sodium bicarbonate was added incrementally to achieve a physiological pH. 
The OrganOx metra perfusion device incorporates online blood gas measurement 
(Terumo CD1-500) together with software-controlled algorithms to control PO2 
and PCO2 (within physiological limits), temperature (37 °C), mean arterial pressure 
(65–75 mm Hg) and), inferior vena cava pressure (0–2 mm Hg). Typical blood 
flows of 200–400 ml min−
1 (artery) and 1,000-1,200 ml min−
1 (portal vein) were 
obtained. Glucose was measured manually and the value entered into the device. 
If glucose fell below 10 mmol l−
1 this automatically triggered the infusion of a fat-
free TPN mixture (Nutriflex Special, B. Braun Ltd) into the perfusate.
NMP continued throughout the duration of transport and storage until the 
 
transplanting team were ready to implant the liver. The minimum protocol-stipulated 
 
NMP duration was 4 h, the time needed for ATP repletion in animal studies11. 
The maximum allowed NMP duration was 24 h in line with the experience in the 
phase-I study and the regulatory approval for the device9.
Sample collection. Tissue biopsies (donor liver and bile duct), recipient blood 
and urine were collected at pre-specified time points from every liver/transplanted 
patient in the study. In addition to these, samples of perfusate fluid and bile were 
collected from every NMP liver. These were stored in a central biobank established 
by the COPE Consortium for use in ongoing mechanistic studies. Each sample was 
allocated a unique bar code, which the biobank coordinator was able to match to 
a specific trial identification number. No patient identifiable data were associated 
with each sample.
Study end points. The primary endpoint was defined as the difference between the 
two treatment arms in the peak level of serum AST within seven days after trans-
plant. This is a clinically accepted biomarker, predictive of primary non-function 
as well as graft and patient survival12,24 and is also associated with histological 
evidence of moderate to severe perfusion injury25,26.
A surrogate marker of graft survival was used in this trial for two reasons: (1) 
the relatively high survival rates in liver transplantation ( > 90%) and (2) the mul-
tifactorial causes of graft loss. A trial based directly on graft or patient survival 
would have had to be unfeasibly large.
In order to ensure consistency and to minimise the hypothetical AST ‘wash-out’ 
effect in the NMP-treated organs, the first post-transplantation value was measured 
between 12 and 24 h after reperfusion.
Secondary end points included: (1) organ discard rate (after retrieval); (2) 
post-reperfusion syndrome27: > 30% drop in mean arterial pressure persisting 
for > 1 min within five minutes of reperfusion; (3) primary non-function: irre-
versible graft dysfunction, for non-technical and non-immunological causes, lead-
ing to death or emergency liver replacement during the first 10 days after liver 
transplantation; (4) early allograft dysfunction13 as indicated by any one of the 
following clinical indicators: (i) bilirubin > 170 μ
mol l−
1 on day 7 after transplant; 
(ii) INR > 1.6 on day 7 after transplant; (iii) peak-AST > 2,000 IU l−
1 during the 
first 7 days; (4) length of hospital and ICU stays; (5) need for renal replacement 
therapy; (6) evidence of cholangiopathy on MRCP at six months; (7) graft and 
patient survival at one year.
Full details of all secondary outcomes are available in the trial protocol28.
Six-month MRCP. An MRCP scan was performed six months (range 
 
5–7 months) after transplant to evaluate the biliary tree for features of cholangiopathy 
 
evident by biliary strictures. All scans were reviewed by two independent radio-
logists blinded to the method of organ preservation with disparities adjudicated 
by a third radiologist. Owing to the lack of any existing grading system for biliary 
strictures, a system was agreed to in advance by consensus among the radiolo-
gists to allow definitive categorization of the presence and site of strictures. The 
findings were reported as follows: (1) normal biliary tree; (2) anastomotic stric-
ture ( > 70% of luminal diameter); (3) unequivocal evidence of non-anastomotic 
stricture anywhere in the biliary tree; (4) both anastomotic and non-anastomotic 
 
biliary strictures.
Statistical analysis. Previous data from Universitaetsklinikum Essen, Germany 
(A.Pau. & S.R.K., unpublished observations), demonstrated the geometric mean of 
peak AST to be 608.59 IU l−
1 in patients transplanted following SCS. The present 
study was powered to detect a (clinically relevant) 33% reduction in peak AST 
with 90% power at a 5% significance level, requiring 220 transplanted livers (110 
per arm).
Results are reported as a modified intention-to-treat analysis. A per-protocol 
sensitivity analysis was also performed excluding livers that received machine per-
fusion outside the protocol specified range (4–24 h) and comparing the groups 
according to the treatment actually received. Livers randomized but not retrieved 
were excluded from the analysis.
Primary outcome was analysed using ANOVA with adjustment for stratification 
factors. The peak AST was calculated for each recipient with at least two values 
available. Missing AST values were not imputed. Binary outcomes were assessed 
using test for proportions or logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders 
and report odds ratios. Continuous outcomes were compared using a Student’s 
t-test, if normally distributed, or by Mann–Whitney U-test otherwise. Time-to-
event outcomes were analysed using Kaplan–Meier estimates and log-rank tests. 
Outcomes are reported with 95% confidence intervals and P values to three decimal 
places. P < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.
Pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed for donor type (DCD versus 
DBD), donor risk index (ET-DRI) and MELD score using tests for interaction and 
reported using forest plots. Interaction methods were used to look for consistency 
of treatment effect across the different subgroups and reported using forest plots. 
The study was not powered to detect differences in the subgroups; these results 
should only be regarded as hypothesis-generating.
Analyses were conducted using Stata version 14.2 (StataCorp).
No formal interim analyses of end points were carried out. At regular intervals, 
an independent Data Monitoring Committee reviewed confidential reports cov-
ering recruitment, safety parameters and primary end point data.
Full details of the statistical methodology are available in the Supplementary 
Information.

flows, metabolic (pH) and synthetic (bile production) liver function were available

to the operator. In addition, lactate measurements were carried out using external 
blood gas analysis. The trial protocol did not stipulate the manner in which these 
parameters should be interpreted.
Once trial recruitment was complete, an ad hoc analysis was performed in which 
NMP organs were categorized according to those which, following transplantation, 
displayed minimal preservation injury (MPI; peak AST < 250 IU l−
1) and those 
with severe preservation injury (SPI; peak AST > 1,000 IU l−
1). Groups were com-
pared for differences in donor and recipient characteristics, perfusate biochemistry, 
bile production and evidence of post-reperfusion syndrome.
Adverse events. Reporting of adverse events was in accordance with the European 
Commission MEDDEV guidelines29. Following trial completion, these were 
reviewed by two independent clinicians blinded to the treatment arm. Adverse 
events with a Clavien-Dindo30 grading greater than IIIa were considered serious 
adverse events. Rates of adverse events are reported with 95% confidence intervals. 
No statistical tests were applied to these data.
Full details of the trial methodology are available in the clinical trial protocol28.

Life Sciences Reporting Summary
Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form is intended for publication with all accepted life 
science papers and provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting. Every life science submission will use this form; some list 
items might not apply to an individual manuscript, but all fields must be completed for clarity. 
For further information on the points included in this form, see Reporting Life Sciences Research. For further information on Nature Research 
policies, including our data availability policy, see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist. 
�    Experimental design
1.   Sample size
Describe how sample size was determined.
Data from 416 liver transplant recipients from University Hospital Essen 
demonstrated the geometric mean of peak AST to be 608.59 IU/L (the geometric 
mean is used as peak AST is non-normally distributed).  220 transplants (110 per 
arm) would have 90% power at 5% significance level to detect a 33% reduction (to 
401.67 IU/L) in the geometric mean of peak AST. Thus the trial required a sample 
size of 220 livers to be transplanted and reach the primary endpoint. 
 
Once trial recruitment was complete, an ad hoc analysis was performed in which 
NMP organs were categorised according to those which, following transplant, 
displayed minimal preservation injury (MPI; peak AST <250 IU/litre; n=28) and 
those with more severe preservation injury (SPI; peak AST >1000 IU/litre; n=25). 
2.   Data exclusions
Describe any data exclusions.
Inclusion criteria for donors and recipients were deliberately broad to represent 
the full spectrum of clinical practice. Whole livers from brainstem death (DBD) and 
circulatory death (DCD) donors aged at least 16 years were eligible. 
Recipients were eligible provided they were at least 18 years old and listed for a 
liver-only transplant, excluding those with fulminant liver failure, due to their poor 
prognosis regardless of organ quality.  
3.   Replication
Describe whether the experimental findings were 
reliably reproduced.
This is the first phase 3 randomised controlled trial to compare any form of 
machine perfusion technology with static cold storage in human liver 
transplantation. This findings have broadly confirmed those demonstrated in small 
scale animal studies and in small retrospectively matched case series.  
 
This was a clinical trial not involving experiments that need replication.
4.   Randomization
Describe how samples/organisms/participants were 
allocated into experimental groups.
Once an eligible donor organ was allocated to a consented recipient and the 
availability of the normothermic liver perfusion (NMP) team was confirmed, the 
liver was randomised. All clinical decisions thereafter, including graft suitability and 
procedure scheduling, were made independently of the trial team.  
Using an online randomisation tool, livers were assigned to NMP or static cold 
storage with 1:1 allocation ratio as per a computer generated randomisation 
schedule using variable block size, stratified by transplant centre and donor type 
(DBD/DCD). The unit of randomisation was donor livers rather than recipients, but 
analysis is reported for the transplant recipients.
5.   Blinding
Describe whether the investigators were blinded to 
group allocation during data collection and/or analysis.
This was an open label study. Due to the nature of the intervention (large machine 
perfusion device), it was not possible to blind investigators as to which arm the 
liver had been randomised. .
Note: all studies involving animals and/or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used.

12. Description of human research participants
Describe the covariate-relevant population 
characteristics of the human research participants.
Livers were obtained from deceased donors aged at least 16 years who's family 
members had provided appropriate consent for the donation of their organs. 
Recipients were eligible provided they were at least 18 years old and listed for a 
liver-only transplant, excluding those with fulminant liver failure, due to their poor 
prognosis regardless of organ quality.  
 
Donors in both arms of the study were well matched in the following respects: 
Donor type (DBD, DCD); age; sex; ethnicity; cause of death; BMI; eurotransplant 
donor risk index. 
Recipients in both arms of the study were well matched in the following respects: 
Age; sex; cause of liver failure; BMI; retransplants; Model of end-stage liver disease 
(MELD) score; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
