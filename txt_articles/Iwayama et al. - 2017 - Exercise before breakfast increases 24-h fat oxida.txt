Abstract
Background
Exercise performed in a postprandial state does not increase 24-h fat oxidation of male and
female subjects. Conversely, it has been shown in male subjects that exercise performed in a
postabsorptive state increases 24-h fat oxidation compared with that in sedentary control and
that with exercise trials performed after breakfast, lunch, or dinner. There is a paucity of study
evaluating the effect of exercise performed in a postabsorptive state in female subjects.
Method
Nine young female subjects participated in indirect calorimetry measurement over 24-h
using a room-size metabolic chamber in which subjects remained sedentary or performed
60 min exercise before breakfast at 50% of _
V O2max. Exercise was accompanied by an
increase in energy intake to ensure that subjects were in a similar state of energy balance
over 24 h for the two trials.
Findings
Compared with the sedentary condition, exercise performed before breakfast increased 24-
h fat oxidation (519 ± 37 vs. 400 ± 41 kcal/day). Time courses of relative energy balance dif-
fered between trials with transient negative energy balance observed before breakfast. The
lowest values of relative energy balance observed during the 24-h calorimetry, i.e., transient
energy deficit, were greater in exercise trials than in sedentary trials. The transient deficit in
carbohydrate balance was also observed before breakfast, and magnitude of the deficit was
greater in exercise trial compared to that of sedentary trial.
Interpretation
Under energy-balanced conditions, exercise performed in a post-absorptive state increases
24-h fat oxidation in female subjects. The effect of exercise performed before breakfast can
be attributed to nutritional state: a transient deficit in energy and carbohydrate at the end of
exercise.

 Introduction
Fat oxidation increases during exercise, and its determinants are well-characterized; exercise
intensity [1,2], exercise duration [3], training status [4,5], nutritional state [6,7], and gender
are the factors affecting fat oxidation during exercise. Fat oxidation during exercise is expected
to be increased by prolonged exercise at moderate intensity performed in a post-absorptive
state and to be greater in trained individuals and females.
To understand the implications for body weight regulation, the effect of exercise on energy
metabolism during the post-exercise recovery period should be considered as well. Several studies
evaluated the effect of exercise on fat oxidation over 24 h (24-h fat oxidation) in an energy-bal-
anced condition; as planned by the experimental design, exercise was accompanied by an increase
in energy intake to achieve an energy-balanced condition because over- and under-feeding have
profound effects on nutrient oxidation [8,9]. Consensus in the literature states that differences in
exercise intensity seems to play little role in determining 24-h fat oxidation [10–14].
The effect of exercise on 24-h fat oxidation seems to depend on when it is performed. Exer-
cise performed in a postprandial state does not increase 24-h fat oxidation of male and female
subjects [11,12,15,16]. Conversely, we have shown in male subjects that exercise performed in
a postabsorptive state, i.e., before breakfast, increase 24-h fat oxidation compared with that in
sedentary control and exercise trials performed after breakfast, lunch, or dinner [16–18]. Of
note, there is a paucity of study evaluating the effect of exercise performed in a postabsorptive
state in female subjects. Physiology and pathophysiology differ between male and female
beyond reproductive function [19], and several lines of evidence warrant further studies with
female subjects. First, there are gender differences in substrate utilization during and after
exercise; females oxidize more fat during exercise, while they oxidize less fat during post-exer-
cise period when compared to males [20–22]. Second, skeletal muscle oxidative activity of
males and females responds differently to training. Endurance exercise undertaken in the
overnight fasted state was more effective for increasing citrate synthase and 3-hydroxy-CoA
dehydrogenase activity in skeletal muscle of males, while exercise after breakfast was more
effective in females [23]. Third, there are gender-based differences in content of intermyocellu-
lar triacylglycerol (IMTG) and gene expression responsible for fat oxidation. Content of IMTG
in female skeletal muscle is higher than that of males [24,25], and female skeletal muscle has
abundant protein and mRNA of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 [26], FAT/CD36, and hor-
mone sensitive lipase [27] compared to males.
The aim of the present study was to determine whether exercise performed in the postab-
sorptive state increase 24-h fat oxidation in female subjects. To this end, 24-h indirect calorim-
etry was performed on two occasions with either a 60 min exercise session before breakfast or
sedentary control condition. Both experimental trials were designed to be energy-balanced
over 24 h.
Materials and methods
Subjects characteristic
Nine young female subjects were recruited to the present study after providing written
informed consent. They were moderately physically active, but none of them engaged in
endurance training. Subjects had no current medical conditions, and none were taking any
medications, including oral contraceptives, at the time of the study. Until one week before the
first experiment, subjects spent a night in the metabolic chamber to become familiarized to the
measurement condition. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of
Tsukuba.

 Pre-study evaluation
All subjects performed a graded exercise test comprised of submaximal and maximal tests
using a cycle ergometer to determine workload corresponding to 50% of individual maximal
oxygen uptake ( _
VO2max) [16].
Experimental protocol
The study was a randomized, repeated measures design comprised of two 24-h calorimetry tri-
als with or without exercise sessions performed before breakfast. To standardize conditions
between trials, 24-h calorimetry trials were carried out in the early follicular phase of the men-
strual cycle, and all experiments were completed within 2 months. Subjects were asked to
maintain their body weight throughout the study, with no significant difference in body
weights observed between individual calorimetry trials (P > 0.40).
On the day prior to 24-h calorimetry, subjects entered the metabolic chamber (day 1,
22:00), and 24-h energy expenditure and nutrient oxidation were measured from 6:00 on day 2
to 6:00 on day 3. Once in the metabolic chamber, subjects slept for 7 h from 23:00 to 6:00. On
day 2, 3 meals (breakfast at 8:00, lunch at 12:00, and dinner at 18:00) were provided, and sub-
jects exercised at 50% of _
VO2max for 60 min using a cycle ergometer beginning at 6:30 (exer-
cise trial) or remained in a sedentary position (sedentary trial). Subjects were instructed to
remain awake and maintain a sedentary position except when performing prescribed exercise
sessions and to sleep only at times specified by the protocol.
Experimental meals were designed to achieve individual energy balance assuming a resting
metabolic rate of 22.1 kcal/kg/day according to estimated energy requirements for Japanese
individuals [28]. Physical activity factor was assumed to be 1.75 (2,248 ± 65 kcal/day) on day 1,
1.60 (1,991 ± 55 kcal/day) in trials with exercise sessions, and 1.24 in sedentary trials (1,637 ±
42 kcal/day) on day 2. Expressed as percentages of total energy intake, experimental meals con-
sisted of 15% protein, 25% fat, and 60% carbohydrate. The contributions of breakfast, lunch,
and dinner to total 24-h energy intake were 33%, 33%, and 34%, respectively.
Measurements
Energy metabolism was measured using a room-size metabolic chamber (Fuji Medical Science,
Chiba, Japan). The airtight chamber measured 2.00 × 3.45 × 2.10 m, with an internal volume
of 14.49 m3. The temperature and relative humidity of in-coming air was controlled at
25.0˚C ± 0.5˚C and 55.0% ± 3.0%, respectively. Concentrations of O2 and carbon dioxide
(CO2) in out-going air were measured using an online process mass spectrometer (VG Prima
δB, Thermo Electron, Winsford, UK). At every 5 min, O2 consumption ( _
VO2) and CO2 pro-
duction ( _
VCO2) rates were calculated using an algorithm providing improved transient
response [29]. Urine was collected during the indirect calorimetry, and urinary nitrogen con-
centration was measured using a chemiluminescent nitrogen analyzer (TN-100, Mitsubishi
Chemical Corp., Kanagawa, Japan). Macronutrient oxidation and energy expenditure were
calculated from _
VO2, _
VCO2 and urinary nitrogen excretion [30]. Energy and nutrient balance
relative to the start of 24-h calorimetry were estimated as the difference between input (meal
consumption) and output (oxidation). Relative energy balance was defined as a function of
time (t) from 6:00 on day 2.

Non-exercise activity was estimated, using a wrist watch-like device (ActiGraph, Ambula-
tory Monitoring, NY, USA), as the number of times the activity signal crossed the zero

 reference point per minute [31]. Body composition was measured using the bioimpedance
method (BC-118E, TANITA Co., Tokyo, Japan), which estimates fat free mass highly corre-
lated to that determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (r = 0.973)[32].
Statistical analyses
Data in the main text and figures are presented as means ± SE. Time course of energy expendi-
ture, carbohydrate oxidation and fat oxidation were compared using repeated measures two-
way ANOVA for sedentary and exercise trials. Mean values were compared using the paired t-
tests for exercise trial and sedentary control trial. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. All
statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software (Version 22, IBM Japan,
Tokyo, Japan).
Results
Physical characteristics of subjects were 23.9 ± 1.3 year of age, 161.4 ± 1.6 cm of height,
57.8 ± 1.6 kg of body weight and 26.9 ± 1.2% of body fat. Their maximal oxygen uptake
( _
VO2max) was 43.6 ± 1.7 ml/kg/min. Habituation of weekly exercise was 2.6 ± 1.0 (h/wk).
Work load, relative intensity of the exercise and average heart rate during 60-min exercise ses-
sion were shown in Table 1. As intended, relative intensity of the exercise was close to 50% of
_
VO2max.
Time course of energy metabolism during 24 h indirect calorimetry was shown in Fig 1.
Compared to the sedentary control trial, energy expenditure and oxidation of carbohydrate
and fat were higher during the exercise (6:30–7:30). Prior to exercise (6:00–6:30 due to prepa-
ration for exercise) and immediately after exercise (7:30–8:00 due to wiping off sweat and
changing clothes), energy expenditure and nutrient oxidation were higher in exercise trials
compared to those of control trials, although difference in fat oxidation immediately after the
exercise was not statistically significant. Accumulated energy expenditure and carbohydrate
and fat oxidation over 24 h were higher for the exercise trial than those of the sedentary trial.
No significant differences were observed in 24-h protein oxidation (P = 11) (Table 2).
Time courses of relative energy balance differed between trials with transient negative
energy balance observed before breakfast (Fig 2). The lowest values of relative energy balance
observed during the 24-h calorimetry, i.e., transient energy deficit, were greater in exercise tri-
als (−507 ± 20 kcal) than in sedentary trials (−127 ± 4 kcal, P<0.01). As planned by experimen-
tal design, relative energy balance of both trials eventually converged to a value similar to the
initial value by the end of the study (6:00 of the day 3), and there were no significant differ-
ences in 24-h energy balance between sedentary (122 ± 34 kcal/day) and exercise trials (67 ±
45 kcal/day, P = 0.20). The transient deficit in carbohydrate balance was also observed before
breakfast, and magnitude of the deficit was greater in exercise trial (−339 ± 23 kcal) compared
to that of sedentary trial (−69 ± 3 kcal, P<0.01). Similarly, transient deficit in fat balance was
also observed (exercise, −144 ± 13; sedentary, −39 ± 6 kcal, P <0.01). Differences in time
course of carbohydrate balance between the two experimental conditions gradually decreased,

 and there was no significant difference at the end of 24 h calorimetry (P = 0.96). Similarly, the
differences in time course of relative fat balance became statistically insignificant (P = 0.45).
No significant differences in non-exercise physical activity were observed between seden-
tary (97 ± 8 counts/min) and exercise trials (105 ± 10 counts/min, P = 0.61).
Discussion
The main finding of the present study was that exercise performed after overnight fasting
increases 24-h fat oxidation in female subjects. Previous studies evaluating in an energy-bal-
anced condition demonstrated that exercise performed in a postprandial state does not
increase 24-h fat oxidation in male and female subjects [11,12,15,16]. Conversely, exercise per-
formed before breakfast increased 24-h fat oxidation more than exercise performed after
breakfast, lunch, or dinner, or in a sedentary control trial in male subjects [16–18]. Taken
together, it is suggested that exercise performed in a postabsorptive state but not that per-
formed in a postprandial state increases 24-h fat oxidation in male and female subjects.
The effect of exercise performed before breakfast may be attributed to the nutritional state
or circadian nature of the early morning hours. In our previous studies with male subjects, the
effect of exercise performed before breakfast was compared with exercise performed after
breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and non-exercise control, and transient energy/carbohydrate defi-
cit was negatively correlated with 24-h fat oxidation [16–18]. In the present study with female
subjects, exercise performed in a postabsorptive state induced bigger transient energy/carbo-
hydrate deficit compared with sedentary control trial. Carbohydrate pool size is the smallest
among the macronutrients stored in the body, and the metabolic response to changes in carbo-
hydrate storage is more sensitive than the response to fat and protein [8]. Hence, the transient
carbohydrate deficit has been indicated as a factor; glycogen shortage induces nuclear translo-
cation of AMPK and upregulation of genes responsible for fat oxidation in skeletal muscle
[33], and hepatic glycogen shortage activates a liver–brain–adipose neural axis to enhance
lipolysis [34].
It is worth mentioning that additional energy intake for the exercise trials was provided as a
proportion of the overall diet as opposed to direct replacement of the substrates oxidized to
support exercise. Possibility that mismatch of additional nutrients and those oxidized during
the exercise affect 24-h fat oxidation remains to be evaluated. Alternatively, the effect of exer-
cise performed before breakfast can be attributed to the circadian nature of the early morning
hours since circadian rhythmicity can be seen in many physiological processes, which include
body temperature, activity, sleep, metabolism, and hormone and neurotransmitter secretion

 [35]. However, the literatures do not support this possibility. First, fat oxidation during exer-
cise in the morning (9:00 h) and evening (17:00 h) was not different when evaluated 3 h after
consumption of an identical meal [36]. Second, only a 4-h difference in exercise timing
affected 24-h fat oxidation; compared to exercise performed after breakfast (10:30–11:30 h),
exercise performed before breakfast (06:30–07:30 h) oxidized significantly more fat [17].
In the present study, the indirect calorimetry was performed in early follicular phase, which
is consistent with literature; in many of the metabolic studies with female subjects, follicular
phase is often adopted to standardize conditions. It has been reported that fat oxidation during
mid-luteal phase is higher compared to early follicular phase, and this is attributed to the dif-
ference in the circulating level of sex steroids, such as 17-ß-estradiol [37]. Since glycogen utili-
zation during endurance exercise is influenced by the menstrual cycle [38], an additional study
is necessary to assess the effect of exercise on 24-h fat oxidation during luteal phase. In addi-
tion, indirect calorimetry itself does not allow us to evaluate sub-spices of substrates: glucose
and glycogen for carbohydrate, plasma free fatty acid, triacylglycerol, and IMTG for fat. To
understand the metabolic response to exercise performed at different times of day, further
studies with other experimental approaches are warranted. For example, insight into tissue
metabolites using magnetic resonance spectroscopy or tissue biopsy and/or use of tracers to
evaluate substrate kinetics would be valuable.
In terms of the translational potential of the present study, some considerations are
required. As a part of the lifestyle diversity in our society, there is wide variation in the time of
day that individuals choose to exercise. Recent surveys on time use in the US and Japan have
revealed that most people exercise after work, while a few individuals exercise before work on
weekdays [39,40]. It requires cautious consideration to decide whether habitual exercise per-
formed in the morning and that performed in the afternoon or early evening have different
effects on 24 h fat oxidation. The effect of a single bout of exercise on 24-h fat oxidation cannot
be extrapolated to the reduction of body fat with chronic exercise. Compared to training in the
fed state, the fasted state suppressed body weight gain from a hypercaloric fat-rich diet in one
study in male subjects [41]. However, in other studies with normal diet, no difference in
weight change was observed between the training in the fed and fasted state in male and female
subjects [23,42–46]. One of the aforementioned studies analyzed weighed food records; aver-
age daily intake of energy, protein, and carbohydrate significantly increased during the train-
ing, but these increases were not significantly different between the fed and fasted training
groups [23]. Evaluating the effect of training performed in fed and fasted state on body compo-
sition may require a longer intervention period, which would make it difficult to accurately
control or monitor dietary habits during the entire study.
Exercise performed in a postabsorptive state increases 24-h fat oxidation in female subjects.
Together with previous studies [11,12,15,16], the present study suggests that effect of single
bout of exercise on 24-h fat oxidation depends on when it is performed. Comparison of the
chronic effects of exercise performed at different time of day on body fat remains to be
performed.
