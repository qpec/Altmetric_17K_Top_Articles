Key Points
• rVIII-SingleChain is a novel
rFVIII, designed to have high
stability and high binding
affinity for VWF.
• In severe hemophilia A
patients, rVIII-SingleChain
was well tolerated and
resulted in low bleeding rates,
when dosed twice per week.
Recombinant VIII (rVIII)-SingleChain is a novel B-domain–truncated recombinant factor
VIII(rFVIII),comprisedofcovalentlybondedfactorVIII(FVIII)heavyandlight chains. It was
designed to have a higher binding affinity for von Willebrand factor (VWF). This phase 1/3
study investigated the efficacy and safety of rVIII-SingleChain in the treatment of bleeding
episodes, routine prophylaxis, and surgical prophylaxis. Participants were ‡12 years of
age, with severe hemophilia A (endogenous FVIII <1%). The participants were allocated
by the investigator to receive rVIII-SingleChain in either an on-demand or prophylaxis
regimen. Of the 175 patients meeting study eligibility criteria, 173 were treated with rVIII-
SingleChain, prophylactically (N 5 146) or on-demand (N 5 27). The total cumulative
exposure was 14 306 exposure days (EDs), with 120 participants reaching ‡50 EDs and
52 participants having ‡100 EDs. Hemostatic efficacy was rated by the investigator as
excellent or good in 93.8% of the 835 bleeds treated and assessed. Across all prophylaxis
regimens, the median annualized spontaneous bleeding rate was 0.00 (Q1, Q3: 0.0, 2.4)
and the median overall annualized bleeding rate (ABR) was 1.14 (Q1, Q3: 0.0, 4.2). Surgical hemostasis was rated as excellent/good in
100% of major surgeries by the investigator. No participant developed FVIII inhibitors. In conclusion, rVIII-SingleChain is a novel rFVIII
molecule showing excellent hemostatic efficacy in surgery and in the control of bleeding events, low ABR in patients on prophylaxis,
and a favorable safety profile in this large clinical study. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01486927. (Blood.

Introduction
Hemophilia is an X-linked congenital bleeding disorder caused by a
coagulation factor deficiency, which affects an estimated 1 in 10 000
births. The primary aim of care is to prevent and treat bleeding
using coagulation factor replacement therapy.1 In hemophilia care
today, challenging unmet needs remain to be addressed; among
those are the poor uptake of prophylaxis, and the prevention of
hemophilic arthropathy and inhibitor development.2 Optimization
of prophylaxis to prevent (or delay) functional deterioration of an
existing hemophilic arthropathy and development of less immunoge-
nic replacement clotting concentrates are the potential solutions.

 current prophylactic regimens, improve compliance, and reduce the
burden of musculoskeletal complications of recurrent joint bleeds.3
The plasma half-life of most currently available factor VIII (FVIII)
products means patients are required to inject FVIII every other day
or 3 times a week, resulting in poor compliance.4,5 Recently, several
new recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) products with extended half-life have
completed phase 3 studies.6,7 Although (glycol) pegylation and Fc
fusion have prolonged the half-life of rFVIII, this extension is limited
to only 1.5 to 1.7 times the normal half-life of endogenous FVIII.
This is largely due to the dependence of FVIII on the half-life of
von Willebrand factor (VWF) in the circulation.8
Immunogenicity remains the other major challenge of replacement
therapy in FVIII-deficient patients. Ex vivo studies suggest that in
addition to protection from proteolysis, VWF prevents uptake of
FVIII by antigen-presenting cells.9,10 This mechanism is presumed to
mitigate the risk of inhibitor development; therefore, improved binding
of FVIII to VWF may reduce the likelihood of inhibitor formation.
The recombinant VIII (rVIII)-SingleChain is comprised of the
FVIII heavy and light chain covalently fused into a single polypeptide
protein, which upon activation by thrombin, is indistinguishable from
endogenous activated FVIII.11 The single-chain design results in a
stable and homogenous drug product with increased binding affinity
for VWF, and PK properties that are superior to those of full-length
rFVIII.12 Of note, these favorable PK attributes were achieved
without glycopegylation or fusion to antibody fragments.
Here, we report the efficacy, safety, and PK results of a pro-
spective phase 1/3 study investigating rVIII-SingleChain for pro-
phylaxis, on-demand treatment, and perioperative management of
severe hemophilia A.
Methods
Study design and patients
This open-label, nonrandomized multicenter study recruited males with severe
hemophilia A (FVIII activity ,1%), previously treated with FVIII (.150
exposure days [EDs] prior to enrollment), and aged between 12 and 65 years.
Patients with a personal or family history (first-degree relatives) of FVIII
inhibitors, or a detectable inhibitor titer at screening were excluded from the
study. Other exclusion criteria were laboratory evidence of hepatic and renal
failure, and immunosuppression (including low CD4 counts in HIV-positive
patients). For full inclusion and exclusion criteria see supplemental Methods,
available on the Blood Web site.
ThestudywasconductedinaccordancewiththeInternationalConferenceon
Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the ethical principles
outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki 2008.13 Ethics approval, individual
informed consent, and approval by the relevant national authorities was obtained
prior to enrollment. The safety of study participants was overseen by an
Independent Data Monitoring Committee.
Dosing
Participants were assigned to either prophylaxis or on-demand therapy by the
investigator and switching therapies was not permitted during the study. Patients
on routine prophylaxis could be prescribed 20 to 40 IU/kg rVIII-SingleChain
everyseconddayor 20to50 IU/kgrVIII-SingleChain2to3timesperweek,orat
other doses or dosing frequencies at the investigator’s discretion. The FVIII
treatment regimen used prior to enrollment and the patient’s bleeding phenotype
were taken into account. The prescription for dosing rVIII-SingleChain to treat
bleeding in patients receiving on-demand therapy or breakthrough bleeds in
patients on routine prophylaxis was guided by the World Federation of
Hemophilia (WFH) recommendations for the treatment of different types of
bleeding locations and intensity.14 The dose could be adjusted during the study
if necessary.
For patients undergoing surgery, the rVIII-SingleChain dosing regimen was
individualized, based on the type of surgery and the clinical status of the patient.
The dosing was adjusted in the pre-, intra-, and postsurgical settings to achieve
and maintain an FVIII activity level recommended by the WFH guidelines.1
Efficacy end points
The primary efficacy end points of this study were the annualized spontane-
ous bleeding rate (AsBR) and hemostatic efficacy in the control of bleeding
episodes, and during surgery. The secondary efficacy end-points were the
annualized bleeding rate (ABR) for all bleeds and the number of injections of
rVIII-SingleChain required to achieve hemostasis. Bleeding episodes were
either treated by the patient or, when in hospital, by the investigator, and
classified as spontaneous when they occurred without apparent external
cause, or traumatic when an injury preceded the bleeding event.
Hemostatic efficacy in bleeding events treated with rVIII-SingleChain was
rated by the investigator on a 4-point rating scale, utilizing information provided
by the patient and considering the number of doses needed to control the bleed
(Table 1).The efficacyof rVIII-SingleChain in surgicalprophylaxiswas rated by
the investigator on a 4-point rating scale, based on information from the surgeon
on intraoperative hemostasis, and the anesthesia team on intraoperative blood
lossandtransfusionrequirements(ifany)(Table1).Eachtreatedbleedorsurgery
was assigned an efficacy rating of excellent, good, moderate, or no response.
Treatments assigned an efficacy rating of excellent or good were considered a
treatment success.
In participants assigned to a prophylaxis or on-demand regimen, the ABR
was calculated for all bleeds and the AsBR for spontaneous bleeding events.
Safety end points
The primary safety end point was the rate of inhibitor formation to FVIII
evaluated from the time of first dose through the end-of-study visit. Inhib-
itory antibodies against FVIII were determined using the Nijmegen-modified
Bethesda assay, as previously described.14 Anti–rVIII-SingleChain anti-
bodies were determined via a 2-tiered approach using direct-binding enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assays. Antibodies against rFVIII-Chinese hamster
ovary cell proteins were detected using a validated enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay and confirmed using Surface Plasmon Resonance technology
(see supplemental Methods for more details).
Safety was further assessed on the basis of the following secondary end
points: local tolerability at the site of injection assessed by investigator and
participant;the number,type,andseverity ofadverseevents(AEs); laboratory
safety parameters (hematology and biochemistry); and vital signs and
physical examination.
PK assessment
The potency of rVIII-SingleChain was assigned using the chromogenic substrate
assay calibrated against the World Health Organization FVIII standard (see
supplemental Methods for details). PK was assessed in a subgroup of patients
following the initial dose (50 IU/kg 610%) and repeated dosing; pre-dose, 10 to
15 minutes, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 24, 28, 32, 48, 72, and 96 hours. A noncompartmental
PKanalysisofFVIIIactivityinplasmawasperformed,withandwithoutbaseline
correction,for theindividualparticipant plasmaFVIIIactivity-vs-timedatausing
Model 202 for constant injection in WinNonlin 6.3.0 (Phoenix Build 6.3.0.395;
Pharsight Corp, St. Louis, MO). The following parameters were calculated:
incremental recovery (IR), maximum observed FVIII activity (Cmax), time to
Cmax, terminal half-life, clearance, volume of distribution at steady-state, area
under the curve (time zero to last quantifiable FVIII activity and time zero
extrapolated to infinity), and mean residence time.
Statistical analysis
Efficacy analyses were conducted in participants who received at least 1 dose of
rVIII-SingleChain as part of either on-demand treatment or routine prophylaxis.
The ABR and the AsBR were calculated according to the following formula:

 from the PK and surgical parts of the study. Descriptive statistics included the
median and interquartile range. Data from all prophylaxis regimens was
combined and compared with on-demand therapy. Statistical comparisons were
based on estimates from a Poisson model. All tests were performed at the 2-sided
0.05 level of significance.
Safety was assessed in all participants exposed to rVIII-SingleChain. The
study was sufficiently powered to rule out an estimated incidence of inhibitor
development of more than 6.8%. An exact 2-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson
confidenceinterval(CI)(or1-sided97.5%upperconfidencelimit)wastobeused
for estimating the incidence of inhibitor formation.
Results
Study population
Participant disposition in the study is shown in Figure 1. Of the 204
patients screened, 175 met study eligibility criteria and were enrolled
into the study. In total, 173 patients completed the study; 146 received
prophylaxis and 27 received on-demand therapy. At screening, he-
mophilic arthropathy was reported by 15 patients (56%) assigned to
on-demand therapy and by 71 patients (49%) assigned to prophylactic
therapy.
The initial 27 patients who entered the study underwent a compar-
ative PK investigation (Part 1), the results of which have been reported
previously.12 Of the 27 patients who completed the PK investigation, 26
patients continued into a treatment phase (Part 2) and 1 patient elected to
withdrawfromthestudy.Participantswereassignedtoeitherprophylaxis
(N 5 14) or on-demand therapy with rVIII-SingleChain (N 5 12).
Part 3 of the study recruited 148 additional patients and 1 patient
withdrew prior to dosing with rVIII-SingleChain. Sixty-four of the 147
patients in Part 3 underwent an initial PK investigation. Of these, 30
patients underwent a repeat PK investigation 3- to6-months later. As in
Part 2, patients in Part 3 were assigned to either prophylaxis (N 5 132)
or on-demand therapy with rVIII-SingleChain (N 5 15).
Thirteen patients underwent 16 surgical procedures during the
surgical substudy. Overall, the study patients accumulated 14 306 EDs
with rVIII-SingleChain; 120 patients were treated for $50 EDs, and of
those, 52 received rVIII-SingleChain for $100 EDs. Demographics
of the patients who received rVIII-SingleChain are shown in Table 2.
rVIII-SingleChain in prophylaxis
In this study, patients received prophylaxis in a regimen that was
assigned by the investigator, taking into account the patient’s FVIII
treatment regimen used prior to enrollment and the patient’s bleeding
phenotype. Of the 146 patients on prophylaxis,79 (54%) were assigned
a3 timesperweekregimen,47 (32%) atwice perweek regimen,9 (6%)
an rVIII-SingleChain every other day regimen, and 11 (8%) were
assigned other regimens (Figure 1). Data on the previous dosing
regimen was available for 121 patients. Prior to enrollment, 73 patients
(60%) were treated with an on-demand regimen and 48 patients (40%)
were treated with prophylaxis. Treatment regimens prior to study entry
and at the end of this study are shown in Table 3. A comparison of
previous and end-of-study treatment regimens for the 48 patients in
whominformationontheprevioustreatmentregimenwasavailableand
who were treated with prophylaxis therapy prior to enrollment are
shown in Table 4.
Patients on prophylaxis 3 times per week were assigned doses by
their individual investigator; median dose was 30 IU/kg per injection.
Patients assigned a twice per week regimen used a median dose of
35 IU/kg. The median consumption of rVIII-SingleChain across
all prophylaxis regimens was 4283 IU/kg per year (mean 6 SD,
4494 6 1778.17 IU/kg) (Table 5).
Across all prophylaxis regimens, the observed median AsBR
was 0.0 (Q1, Q3: 0.0, 2.4) and the observed mean 6 SD AsBR was
2.1 6 4.76. The calculated AsBR across all prophylaxis regimens was
1.6 bleeds per year (95% CI, 1.3-1.8). In the subgroup of patients who
received prophylaxis twice a week, the observed median AsBR was
0.0(Q1,Q3:0.0,1.1)andtheobservedmean6SDAsBRwas2.3366.67,
which were comparable with values in subjects who received pro-
phylaxis 3 times a week (median AsBR, 0.0 [Q1, Q3: 0.0, 3.6] and
mean 6 SD AsBR, 2.33 6 3.87). The AsBR with prophylaxis was
markedly reduced (P , .0001) compared with the on-demand

 rVIII-SingleChain in the control of bleeding events
A total of 848 bleeding events were treated with rVIII-SingleChain in
the study, 835 of which were assessed by the investigator. Of the 848
bleeding events, 590 occurred in the 27 patients on on-demand therapy
and 258 occurred in the 146 patients on prophylaxis. Of the patients
on prophylaxis, 43% had no treated bleeds during the study. Of the
835 bleeding events assessed by the investigator, efficacy of rVIII-
SingleChain to control the bleed was rated as excellent in 603 (72.2%),
good in 180 (21.6%), and moderate in 52 (6.2%). No bleeds were
reported as having a poor or no response to rVIII-SingleChain
(Table 6).
For 80.9% of the bleeding events, patients required a single dose of
rVIII-SingleChain to achieve hemostatic control. A second dose was
required to achieve hemostatic control in 12.6% of bleeding events and
3 or more doses were required for 6.5% of bleeding events.The median
cumulative dose used to treat a bleeding event was 34.7 IU/kg (mean,
45.4 IU/kg) and the median dose per injection to treat a bleeding event
was 31.7 IU/kg (mean, 32.0 IU/kg). The doses used to treat bleeds that
achieved hemostatic control after a single dose were not higher than
the initial doses used to treat bleeds that required multiple doses for
hemostatic control (Table 6).
rVIII-SingleChain in surgical prophylaxis
Thirteen patients underwent a total of 16 surgical procedures that re-
quired general, spinal, or regional anesthesia (wisdom teeth extrac-
tion [1], abdominal hernia repair [1], elbow replacement [1], ankle
arthroplasty [1], knee replacement [5], cholecystectomy [1] combined
with lengthening of the Achilles tendon and straightening of the right
toes [1], circumcision [3], open reduction internal fixation right ankle
[1], and hardware removal right ankle [1]). Two of these procedures
(cholecystectomy combined with lengthening of the Achilles tendon
and straightening of the right toes) were performed in the same session
but received differentiated assessment of hemostasis. Overall, inves-
tigators’ assessed hemostatic efficacy of rVIII-SingleChain in surgical
prophylaxis as excellent in 15/16 surgeries and as good in 1/16
surgeries. Median rVIII-SingleChain consumption (pre- and intra-
operatively) was 89.36 IU/kg (range, 40.45-108.58 IU/kg).
Safety
Immunogenicity.
Safety was assessed in all 174 patients exposed to
rVIII-SingleChain. FVIII inhibitors were not detected in any study
patients; the inhibitor incidence was 0% (95% CI, 0.0-2.1). In the 120
patientswith$50EDs,theinhibitorincidencewas0%(95%CI,0.0-3.0).
Eightpatientsenteredthestudywithapositivetestfornon-inhibitory
antidrug antibodies (ADAs) (ie, anti-FVIII immunoglobulin G [IgG]
and/or IgM antibodies), prior to dosing with rVIII-SingleChain. Seven
of these patients remained positive until the end-of-study/last-visit on-
study and 1 patient, who started the study with positive IgG antibodies,
became negative by the end-of-study visit. Four other patients became
positive for IgG and/or IgM during the study; 2 patients had negative
and 2 had positive antibody results at the end-of-study visit.
No patient had preexisting anti-Chinese hamster ovary cell protein
antibodies or developed them during the study.
Tolerability.
rVIII-SingleChain was well tolerated. Of 13 580
injections in which tolerability was assessed by the patients, 99.3%
reported no reactions, 0.5% very slight, 0.15% slight, 0.05% moderate,
andnone had severe reactions.Consistentwiththese patientassessments,
for 552 (99.8%) of the investigator-assessed injections, the assessment
of the reaction was “none.” Only 1 patient (0.2%) with erythema was
assessedbytheinvestigatorashavingaveryslightor“barelyperceptible”
reaction.
AEs.
Of the 174 patients, 113 (64.9%) experienced a total of 292
treatment-emergent AEs and the majority (77%) were mild in severity
(supplemental Table 1). Only 7.5% of subjects experienced AEs that
were considered to be related to the study drug (N 5 13 events). A
singlestudydrug-relatedAE,acaseofhypersensitivity,wasconsidered
severe, and all others were mild or moderate in intensity. No patient
withdrew from the study due to an AE. The 3 most common AEs
reported in the study were nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, and headache.
Of the 10 serious AEs (SAEs) reported in this study, none led
to withdrawal from the study and 1 was judged to be related by
the investigator; this was an event of hypersensitivity for which the
investigator hospitalized the patient for observation, administered
steroids and antihistamines, which provided relief within 30 minutes
and allowed for hospital discharge later on the same day. The patient
remained on rVIII-SingleChain treatment and tolerated it well. No
clinically evident thromboembolic events were observed during the
study.
Evaluation of the FVIII PK following repeat IV administration
of rVIII-SingleChain
The PK investigation in Part 3 of the study confirmed the rVIII-
SingleChain PK properties of Part 1 as published previously.12 PK
parameters after initial (after the first dose, N 5 64) and repeat
dosing (3- to 6-months later, N 5 30) in Part 3 are summarized in
Table 7. Because rVIII-SingleChain FVIII plasma activity is
underestimated by the 1-stage clotting assay, PK parameters were
based on plasma FVIII activity measured by the chromogenic
substrate assay. Results demonstrated a stable (time-independent)
PK profile with a half-life of 12.9 hours, IR of 1.99 IU/dL per
IU/kg, and clearance of 3.05 mL/kg per hour after repeat dosing.
The PK of adolescents ($12 to ,18 years) was not different from
that of adults ($18 years of age) (data not shown).
Discussion
In this large phase 1/3 clinical study of individuals aged 12 to 65 years
with severe hemophilia A, rVIII-SingleChain demonstrated excellent
efficacy for prophylactic treatment with 43% of patients having no

 treated bleeds during the study. The median annualized spontaneous
bleedrateswere0.0whenadministeredeithertwiceor3timesperweek.
rVIII-SingleChain showed excellent efficacy in controlling bleeding
episodes at doses that are in line with the WFH recommendations.
Treatment success (ie, investigator rating of excellent or good) was
documented in 93.8% of all bleeds assessed. Thirteen patients
underwent 16 surgeries, including 7 joint surgeries/replacements
with surgical hemostasis, which were rated excellent in 15 (94%)
procedures and good in 1 (6%).
Across all prophylaxis regimens, a very low median ABR (1.14
[Q1, Q3: 0.0, 4.2]) and a median AsBR of 0.0 (Q1, Q3: 0.00, 2.4) was
achieved. As common practice in pivotal registration studies for
new FVIII products, this study had no comparator arm to allow a direct
comparison of efficacy with other products. Although indirect com-
parisons across studies are limited and do not allow for superiority
claims, all of the recently published studies follow the same regulatory
guidance (European Medicines Agency 2011) and enroll similar
populations (ie, patients with severe hemophilia A). Efmoroctocog
alfa (Eloctate) reported a median ABR of 1.6 with individualized
prophylaxis.7 Median ABR with turoctocog alfa (Novoeight) was 3.7
in adults and adolescents with 83% of patients receiving a 3 times per
week prophylaxis schedule.15 Simoctocog alfa (Nuwiq) reported a
median ABR of 0.9 in a small study of 32 adult patients; however,
this bleeding rate was achieved with a prophylactic regimen requiring
dosing every second day.16
This study was designed to reflect clinical practice and as such,
patients were assigned to prophylaxis regimens based on the clinical
judgment of the treating physician. This resulted in one-third of the
study population being assigned to a 2 times weekly prophylaxis
regimen and half of the population being assigned to a 3 times weekly
regimen.ABRsinbothpopulationswerelow(0and1.93,respectively),
confirming the possibility of almost complete freedom of bleeding
events when rVIII-SingleChain is prescribed with accurate clinical
judgment.
ThehemostaticefficacyreportedhereforrVIII-SingleChain(93.8%
of bleeds rated as good or excellent) is comparable to that of other
rFVIII products, which range from 81% to 96.1% of bleeds being rated
as excellent or good.6,15,17,18 rVIII-SingleChain was also analogous in
terms of the numbers of injectionsneeded to achieve hemostatic control;
93.5% of bleeds were controlled with 1 or 2 injections. With 1 or 2
injections, efmoroctocog alfa controlled 97.7% of bleeding episodes,
moroctocog alfa (Refacto) controlled 88% (of 677 bleeding events
across 2 studies), and rurioctacog alfa pegol (Adynovate) controlled
95.9% of bleeding episodes.6,7,19
Of the patients on prophylaxis with rVIII-SingleChain, 43%
achieved a zero bleed rate during the study. This is com-
parable to individualized prophylaxis with efmoroctocog alfa
(45%) and twice-weekly prophylaxis with rurioctacog alfa pegol
(39.6%).6,7
Treatment with rVIII-SingleChain during all surgical procedures
resultedinverygoodcontrolofbleeding,withhemostaticefficacyrated
as excellent in 94% of procedures. These results are in line with those
reported recently for other novel rFVIII products. Efmoroctocog alfa
reported excellent hemostasis in 88% and good hemostasis in 12% of
surgeries (N 5 8). For turoctocog alfa, intraoperative hemostasis was
reportedasexcellentin62%andgoodin38%of13patientsundergoing

From 
 Dosing in our study was at the investigators’ discretion with a re-
commendation to start prophylaxis with a dose between 20 to 40 IU/kg
rVIII-SingleChain every second day or 20 to 50 IU/kg 2 to 3 times
per week. Other schedules could be prescribed at the investiga-
tors’ discretion. Six-percent of patients were dosed every second
day, 54% were dosed 3 times per week (median dose, 30 IU/kg),
32% were dosed twice per week (median dose, 35 IU/kg), and 8%
followed other dosing regimens. The adherence to the pro-
phylaxis regimen was high, with 92.5% of patients receiving not
,80% and not .120% of the number of doses prescribed by the
investigator.
Forthetreatmentofbleedingevents,investigatorswereinstructedto
follow the dosing guidelines for different bleeding types as recom-
mended by the WFH in the 2012 edition of the WFH guidelines.1 With
these dosing instructions, the median dose per injection to treat a
bleeding episode was 31.7 IU/kg (range, 6-84), which is in line with
doses used with other new rFVIII products; 27.35 IU/kg per dose for
efmoroctocog alfa and a mean dose of 45.6 IU/kg for turoctocog alfa
was used to stop a bleed.7,15
The overall median consumption for subjects on rVIII-SingleChain
prophylaxis was 4283 IU/kg per year, which is comparable to that of
the recently approved long-acting efmoroctocog alfa where a median
consumption of 4118.4 IU/kg per year was observed in a study
investigating individualized regimens.21
To our knowledge, this pivotal study accumulated the most
EDs for a new rFVIII product, with a total of 14 306 EDs in 174
patients. Of these, 120 patients were treated for $50 EDs and
52 for $100 EDs. Despite this significant exposure and a wide global
reach with multiple ethnicities included in patient recruitment, no
inhibitor development was observed in this study. The immu-
nogenicity of this novel rFVIII molecule will be further explored
in an ongoing study, including previously untreated patients
(#NCT02172950).
Four patients became positive for non-inhibitory IgG ADAs during
the study. At end of study visit, 2 of these patients had a negative
antibody result and 2 patients remained positive. This rate of ADA
development is in line with other recently approved rFVIII products,7
and the incidence of non-neutralizing antibodies against FVIII in
healthy individuals and in patients with hemophilia.22,23 Eight patients
had non-inhibitory ADAs prior to dosing with rVIII-SingleChain,
7 of whom remained ADA positive at the end of the study.
rVIII-SingleChain was well tolerated and showed a favorable AE/
SAE profile similar to that described for other products of the
same class. The 3 most common AEs reported were nasophar-
yngitis, arthralgia, and headache. Of the 10 SAEs reported in this
large study, only 1 was judged to be related to the study drug by
the investigator. This was an event of hypersensitivity that was
controlled by the administration of steroids and antihistamines,
allowing hospital discharge of the patient on the day of the event.
The patient continued in the study. No participants discontinued
due to AEs.
The increased binding affinity of rVIII-SingleChain for VWF
translates into a favorable PK profile of rVIII-SingleChain when
compared with octocog alfa (Advate).12 The previously reported PK
parameters were confirmed in this study and remained consistent after
repeated dosing.
In conclusion, this study, which was designed to reflect clinical
practice, demonstrated with a robust data set that rVIII-SingleChain is
highlyefficaciousinthetreatmentofbleedingevents,routineprophylaxis,
and in controlling hemostasis in a variety of surgical procedures
in adolescents and adults with severe hemophilia A. The study also
demonstrated that rVIII-SingleChain has a favorable safety profile
and is well tolerated. Very low ABRs in patients on individualized
prophylaxis hopefully has the potential to translate into prolonged
freedom from debilitating joint disease.
