How do psychedelic drugs produce their characteristic range of acute effects in
perception, emotion, cognition, and sense of self? How do these effects relate to the
clinical efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapies? Efforts to understand psychedelic
phenomena date back more than a century in Western science. In this article I
review theories of psychedelic drug effects and highlight key concepts which have
endured over the last 125 years of psychedelic science. First, I describe the subjective
phenomenology of acute psychedelic effects using the best available data. Next, I
review late 19th-century and early 20th-century theories—model psychoses theory,
fi
ltration theory, and psychoanalytic theory—and highlight their shared features. I
then briefly review recent findings on the neuropharmacology and neurophysiology
of psychedelic drugs in humans. Finally, I describe recent theories of psychedelic
drug effects which leverage 21st-century cognitive neuroscience frameworks—entropic
brain theory, integrated information theory, and predictive processing—and point out
key shared features that link back to earlier theories. I identify an abstract principle
which cuts across many theories past and present: psychedelic drugs perturb universal
brain processes that normally serve to constrain neural systems central to perception,
emotion, cognition, and sense of self. I conclude that making an explicit effort to
investigate the principles and mechanisms of psychedelic drug effects is a uniquely
powerful way to iteratively develop and test unifying theories of brain function.

INTRODUCTION
Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), psilocybin, and mescaline—
the ‘
classic’psychedelic drugs—can produce a broad range of effects in perception, emotion,
cognition, and sense of self. How do they do this? Western science began its ‘
first wave’of
systematic investigations into the unique effects of mescaline 125 years ago. By the 1950s, rising
interest in mescaline research was expanded to include drugs like DMT, LSD, and psilocybin
in a ‘
second wave’of psychedelic science. Because of their dramatic effect on the character
and contents of subjective awareness, psychedelic drugs magnified the gaps in our scientific
understanding of how brain chemistry relates to subjective experience (see Evarts, 1957; Purpura,
1968). Huxley (1991, p. 12) commented that our understanding circa 1954 was “
absurdly
inadequate”and amounted to a mere “
clue”that he hoped would soon develop into a more robust

understanding. “
Meanwhile the clue is being systematically
followed, the sleuths—biochemists, psychiatrists, psychologists—
are on the trail” (Huxley, 1991, p. 12). A ‘
third wave’of
psychedelic science has recently emerged with its own set of
sleuths on the trail, sleuths who now wield an arsenal of 21st-
century scientific methodologies and are uncovering new sets of
clues.
Existing
theoretical
hurdles
span
five
major
gaps
in
understanding. The first gap is that we do not have an account
of how psychedelic drugs can produce such a broad diversity
of subjective effects. LSD, for example, can produce subtle
intensifications in perception—or it can completely dissolve all
sense of space, time, and self. What accounts for this atypical
diversity?
The second gap is that we do not understand how
pharmacological interactions at neuronal receptors and resulting
physiological changes in the neuron lead to large-scale changes
in the activity of neural populations, or changes in brain
network connectivity, or at the systems-level of global brain
dynamics. What are the causal links in the multi-level pharmaco-
neurophysiological chain?
The third gap is that we do not know how psychedelic drug-
induced changes in brain activity—at any level of description—
map onto the acute subjective phenomenological changes in
perception, emotion, cognition, and sense of self. This kind of
question is not unique to psychedelic drugs (i.e., Crick and Koch,
1998; Tononi and Edelman, 1998) but our current understanding
of psychedelic drug effects clearly magnifies the disconnect
between brain science and subjective experience.
Fourth, there is a gap in our understanding of the relationships
between psychedelic effects and symptoms of psychoses, such
as perceptual distortion, hallucination, or altered self-reference.
What is the relationship between psychedelic effects and
symptoms of chronic psychotic disorders?
Fifth and finally, there is a gap in our clinical understanding
of the process by which psychedelic-assisted therapies improve
mental health (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017). Which
psychedelic drug effects (in the brain or in subjective experience)
enable clinical improvement? How?
Scientific efforts to understand diverse natural phenomena
aim to produce a single theory that can account for many
phenomena using a minimal set of principles. Such theories
are sometimes called unifying theories. Not everyone agrees
on the meaning of ‘
unification’ or ‘
unifying theory’ in
science.1 Morrison (2000) observed that, although theory
unification is a messy process which may not have discernible
universal
characteristics,
historically
successful
unifying
scientific theories tend to have two common features: (1) a
formalized framework (quantitative mathematical descriptions
of the phenomena) and (2) unifying principles (abstract
concepts that unite diverse phenomena). On this conception,
then, a unifying theory of psychedelic drug effects would
offer a single formalized (mathematical or computational)
framework capable of describing diverse psychedelic phenomena
using a minimal set of unifying principles. Unfortunately,
1For example, see Kitcher (1981, 1989), Friedman (1983), and Morrison (2000).
the survey of literature in this review does not locate
an
existing
unifying
theory
of
psychedelic
drug
effects.
It
does,
however,
highlight
enduring
abstract
principles
that recur across more than a century of theoretical efforts.
Furthermore, it reviews recent formalized frameworks which,
although currently heterogeneous and divergent, hint at the
possibility of a quantitative groundwork for a future unifying
theory.
The
field
of
cognitive
neuroscience
offers
formalized
frameworks and general principles designed to track and
model the neural correlates of perception, emotion, cognition,
and
consciousness.
These
broad
frameworks
span
major
levels of description in the brain and attempt to map them
onto behavioral and phenomenological data. Corlett et al. (2009,
p. 516) argue that until this is done “
our understanding of how the
pharmacology links to the symptoms will remain incomplete.”
Montague et al. (2012, p. 1) argue that ‘
computational psychiatry’
can remedy the “
lack of appropriate intermediate levels of
description that bind ideas articulated at the molecular level
to those expressed at the level of descriptive clinical entities.”
Seth (2009, p. 50) argues that “
computational and theoretical
approaches can facilitate a transition from correlation to
explanation in consciousness science” and explains how a
recent LSD, psilocybin, and ketamine study (Schartner et al.,
2017) was motivated by a need to elucidate descriptions
at
intermediate
levels
somewhere
between
pharmacology
and phenomenology: “
We know there’
s a pharmacological
link, we know there’
s a change in experience and we know
there’
s a clinical impact. But the middle bit if you like, what
are these drugs doing to the global activity of the brain,
that’
s the gap we’
re trying to fill with this study”(quoted in
Osborne, 2017). Taken together, the above quotations point
to an emerging sense that cognitive neuroscience frameworks
can address gaps in our understanding of psychedelic drug
effects.
In this article I review theories of psychedelic drug effects.
First, making an effort to clearly define the target explananda,
I review the acute subjective phenomenological properties
of psychedelic effects as well as long-term clinical outcomes
from psychedelic-assisted therapies. Second, I review theories
from
first-wave
and
second-wave
psychedelic
science—
model psychoses theory, filtration theory, and psychoanalytic
theory—and identify core features of these theories. Third,
I review findings from recent neurophysiological research
in
humans
under
psychedelic
drugs.
Finally,
I
review
select 21st-century theories of psychedelic effects that have
been developed within cognitive neuroscience frameworks;
namely, entropic brain theory, integrated information theory,
and predictive processing. My analysis of recent theoretical
efforts
highlights
certain
features,
first
conceptualized
in
19th-
and
20th-century
theories,
which
remain
relevant
in
their
ability
to
capture
both
the
phenomenological
and neurophysiological dynamics of psychedelic effects. I
describe how these enduring theoretical features are now being
operationalized into formalized frameworks and could serve as
potential unifying principles for describing diverse psychedelic
phenomena.

Unifying Theories of Psychedelic Drug Effects
PSYCHEDELIC DRUG EFFECTS
There are dozens of molecules known to cause psychedelic-like
effects (Schultes and Hofmann, 1973; Shulgin and Shulgin, 1991,
1997). This review focuses only on a limited set of drugs dubbed
‘
classical hallucinogens’
or ‘
classic psychedelics’
which are: LSD,
DMT, psilocybin, and mescaline2 (Nichols, 2016). Importantly,
there are qualitative inter-drug differences between the effects of
the four classic psychedelic drugs (Strassman et al., 1994; Hasler
et al., 2004; Studerus et al., 2011; Schmid et al., 2015; Liechti
et al., 2017). Drug dosage is a primary factor in predicting the
types of effects that will occur (Strassman et al., 1994; Riba et al.,
2001b; Hasler et al., 2004; Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Studerus
et al., 2011, 2012; Liechti et al., 2017). Effects unfold temporally
over a drug session; onset effects are distinct from peak effects
and some effects have a higher probability of occurring at specific
timepoints over the total duration of drug effects (Masters and
Houston, 1966; Preller and Vollenweider, 2016). Furthermore,
effects are influenced by non-drug factors traditionally referred
to as set and setting, such as personality, pre-dose mood, drug
session environment, and external stimuli (Figure 1) (Leary et al.,
1963; Studerus et al., 2012; Hartogsohn, 2016; Carhart-Harris and
Nutt, 2017).
The above variables, while crucial, do not completely
prohibit meaningful characterization of general psychedelic
effects, as numerous regularities, patterns, and structure can
still be identified (Masters and Houston, 1966; Grinspoon
and Bakalar, 1979; Preller and Vollenweider, 2016). Indeed,
common psychedelic effects can be reliably measured using
validated psychometric instruments consisting of self-report
questionnaires and rating scales (Strassman et al., 1994; Dittrich,
1998; Riba et al., 2001a; Dittrich et al., 2010; Studerus et al., 2010,
2011; Maclean et al., 2012; Turton et al., 2014; Barrett et al., 2015;
Nour et al., 2016) though some of these rating scales may be
in need of further validation using modern statistical techniques
(Bouso et al., 2016). Items from these rating scales are wrapped
in ‘
scare quotes’in the following discussion in an effort to
characterize the subjective phenomenology of psychedelic effects
from a first-person perspective. An example of rating scale results
is given in (Figure 2).
Perceptual Effects
Perceptual effects occur along a dose-dependent range from
subtle to drastic. The range of different perceptual effects includes
perceptual intensification, distortion, illusion, mental imagery,
elementary hallucination, and complex hallucination (Klüver,
1928; Kometer and Vollenweider, 2016; Preller and Vollenweider,
2016). Intensifications of color saturation, texture definition,
contours, light intensity, sound intensity, timbre variation, and
other perceptual characteristics are common (Kometer and
Vollenweider, 2016; Kaelen et al., 2018). The external world is
experienced as if in higher resolution, seemingly more crisp and
detailed, often accompanied by a distinct sense of ‘
clarity’or
‘
freshness’in the environment (Hofmann, 1980; Huxley, 1991;
2Ayahuasca contains DMT but is importantly different from pure DMT (McKenna
et al., 1984).
FIGURE 1 | ‘Extra-pharmacological’ factors that can determine psychedelic
drug effects (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017). “Trait factors may be biological
[e.g., receptor polymorphisms (Ott, 2007)] or psychological in nature [e.g.,
personality (MacLean et al., 2011) or suggestibility (Carhart-Harris et al.,
2015)]. The pre-state refers to such things as anticipatory anxiety,
expectations and assumptions (which account for so-called ‘placebo’ and
‘nocebo’ effects), and readiness to surrender resistances and ‘let go’ to the
drug effects (e.g., see Russ and Elliott, 2017). In the context of psychedelic
research, the pre-state is traditionally referred to as the ‘set’ (Hartogsohn,
2016). State refers to the acute subjective and biological quality of the drug
experience and may be measured via subjective rating scales or brain imaging
(see Roseman et al., 2017). Dose relates to the drug dosage—which may be
a critical determinant of state (Griffiths et al., 2011; Nour et al., 2016)—as well
as long-term outcomes (see Roseman et al., 2017). Environment relates to the
various environmental influences. In the context of psychedelic research this is
traditionally referred to as ‘setting’ (Hartogsohn, 2016). We recognize that the
environment can be influential at all stages of the process of change
associated with drug action. The long-term outcomes may include such
things as symptoms of a specific psychiatric condition such as
depression—measured using a standard rating scale (Carhart-Harris et al.,
2016a) as well as relatively pathology-independent factors such as personality
(MacLean et al., 2011) and outlook” (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017, p. 1097).
Díaz, 2010; Kometer and Vollenweider, 2016). Sense of meaning
in percepts is altered, e.g., ‘
Things around me had a new strange
meaning for me’
or ‘
Objects around me engaged me emotionally
much more than usual’
(Studerus et al., 2010).
Perceptual distortions and illusions are extremely common,
e.g., ‘
Things looked strange’ or ‘
My sense of size and
space was distorted’or ‘
Edges appeared warped’or ‘
I saw
movement in things that weren’
t actually moving’(Dittrich,
1998; Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013). Textures undulate in
rhythmic movements, object boundaries warp and pulsate, and
the apparent sizes and shapes of objects can shift rapidly
(Kometer and Vollenweider, 2016). Controlled psychophysical
studies have measured various alterations in motion perception
(Carter et al., 2004), object completion (Kometer et al., 2011), and
binocular rivalry (Frecska et al., 2004; Carter et al., 2007).
In what are known as elementary hallucinations—e.g., ‘
I saw
geometric patterns’
—the visual field can become permeated
with intricate tapestries of brightly colored, flowing latticework
and other geometric visuospatial ‘
form constants’ (Klüver,
1928; Siegel and Jarvik, 1975; Kometer and Vollenweider,
2016). In complex hallucinations visual scenes can present
elaborate structural motifs, landscapes, cities, galaxies, plants,
animals, and human (and non-human) beings (Shanon, 2002;
Studerus et al., 2011; Carhart-Harris et al., 2015; Kaelen et al.,
2016; Preller and Vollenweider, 2016; Roseman et al., 2016;

Unifying Theories of Psychedelic Drug Effects
FIGURE 2 | Subjective rating scale items selected after psilocybin (blue) and placebo (red) (n = 15) (Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013). “Items were completed using
a visual analog scale format, with a bottom anchor of ‘no, not more than usually’ and a top anchor of ‘yes, much more than usually’ for every item, with the
exception of ‘I felt entirely normal,’ which had bottom and top anchors of ‘No, I experienced a different state altogether’ and ‘Yes, I felt just as I normally do,’
respectively. Shown are the mean ratings for 15 participants plus the positive SEMs. All items marked with an asterisk were scored significantly higher after
psilocybin than placebo infusion at a Bonferroni-corrected significance level of p < 0.0022 (0.5/23 items)” (Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013, p. 15176).
Kraehenmann et al., 2017b). Complex hallucinations typically
succeed elementary hallucinations and are more likely at higher
doses (Kometer and Vollenweider, 2016; Liechti et al., 2017)
especially under DMT (Strassman et al., 1994; Shanon, 2002).
Both elementary and complex hallucinations are more commonly
reported behind closed eyelids (‘
closed eye visuals’
; CEVs) but
can dose-dependently occur in full light with eyes open (‘
open
eye visuals’
; OEVs) (Kometer and Vollenweider, 2016). CEVs
are often described as vivid mental imagery. Under psychedelic
drugs, mental imagery becomes augmented and intensified—
e.g., ‘
My imagination was extremely vivid’
—and is intimately
linked with emotional and cognitive effects (Carhart-Harris et al.,
2015; Preller and Vollenweider, 2016). “
Sometimes sensible film-
like scenes appear, but very often the visions consist of scenes
quite indescribable in ordinary language, and bearing a close
resemblance to the paintings and sculptures of the surrealistic
school”(Stockings, 1940, p. 31). Psychedelic mental imagery
can be modulated by both verbal (Carhart-Harris et al., 2015)
and musical (Kaelen et al., 2016) auditory stimuli. Synaesthesia
(Ward, 2013) has been reported, especially visual phenomena
driven by auditory stimuli—‘
Sounds influenced the things I
saw’
—but classification of these effects as ‘
true’synaesthesia is
actively debated (Sinke et al., 2012; Brogaard, 2013; Luke and
Terhune, 2013; Terhune et al., 2016).
Somatosensory perception can be drastically altered—e.g.,
‘
I felt unusual bodily sensations’
—including body image, size,
shape, and location (Savage, 1955; Klee, 1963; Preller and
Vollenweider, 2016). Sense of time and causal sequence can lose
their usual linear cause-effect structure making it difficult to track
the transitions between moments (Heimann, 1963; Wittmann
et al., 2007; Wackermann et al., 2008; Studerus et al., 2011;
Schmid et al., 2015).
Overall the perceptual effects of psychedelics are extremely
varied, multimodal, and easily modulated by external stimuli.
Perceptual effects are tightly linked with emotional and cognitive
effects.
Emotional Effects
Emotional psychedelic effects are characterized by a general
intensification of feelings, increased (conscious) access to
emotions, and a broadening in the overall range of emotions
felt over the duration of the drug session. Psychedelics can
induce unique states of euphoria characterized by involuntary
grinning, uncontrollable laughter, silliness, giddiness, playfulness,
and exuberance (Preller and Vollenweider, 2016). Negatively
experience emotions—e.g., ‘
I felt afraid’
or ‘
I felt suspicious and
paranoid’
—are often accompanied by a general sense of losing
control, e.g., ‘
I feared losing control of my mind’(Strassman,
1984; Johnson et al., 2008; Barrett et al., 2017a). However, the
majority of emotional psychedelic effects in supportive contexts
are experienced as positive (Studerus et al., 2011; Schmid et al.,
2015; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b; Belser et al., 2017; Watts et al.,
2017). Both LSD and psilocybin can bias emotion toward positive
responses to social and environmental stimuli (Kometer et al.,
2012; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b; Dolder et al., 2016; Pokorny
et al., 2017). Spontaneous feelings of awe, wonder, bliss, joy,
fun, excitement (and yes, peace and love) are also consistent
themes across experimental and anecdotal reports (Huxley, 1991;

Unifying Theories of Psychedelic Drug Effects
Kaelen et al., 2015; Preller and Vollenweider, 2016; Belser et al.,
2017). In supportive environments, classic psychedelic drugs
can promote feelings of trust, empathy, bonding, closeness,
tenderness, forgiveness, acceptance, and connectedness (Dolder
et al., 2016; Belser et al., 2017; Carhart-Harris et al., 2017b;
Pokorny et al., 2017; Watts et al., 2017). Emotional effects can
be modulated by all types of external stimuli, especially music
(Bonny and Pahnke, 1972; Shanon, 2002; Kaelen et al., 2015,
2018).
Cognitive Effects
Precise characterization of cognitive psychedelic effects has
proven enigmatic and paradoxical (Shanon, 2002; Carhart-Harris
et al., 2016b). Acute changes in the normal flow of linear
thinking—e.g., ‘
My thinking was muddled’or ‘
My thoughts
wandered freely’
—are extremely common (Hasler et al., 2004;
Studerus et al., 2011). This is reflected in reduced performance
on standardized measures of working memory and directed
attention (Carter et al., 2005; Vollenweider et al., 2007);
however, reductions in performance have been shown to occur
less often in individuals with extensive past experience with
the drug’
s effects (Bouso et al., 2013). Crucially, cognitive
impairments related to acute psychedelic effects are dose-
dependent (Wittmann et al., 2007). Extremely low doses,
known as microdoses, have been anecdotally associated with
improvements in cognitive performance (Waldman, 2017; Wong,
2017) “
a claim that urgently requires empirical verification
through controlled research”(Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017,
p. 1103). Theoretical attempts to account for the reported
effects of microdosing have yet to emerge in the literature and
therefore present an important opportunity to future theoretical
endeavors.
Certain cognitive traits associated with creativity can increase
under psychedelics (Sessa, 2008; Baggott, 2015) such as divergent
thinking (Kuypers et al., 2016), use of unlikely language patterns
or word associations (Natale et al., 1978b), expansion of
semantic activation (Spitzer et al., 1996; Family et al., 2016),
and attribution of meaning to perceptual stimuli (Liechti et al.,
2017; Preller et al., 2017) especially musical stimuli (Kaelen
et al., 2015, 2018; Atasoy et al., 2017b; Barrett et al., 2017b).
Primary-process thinking (Rapaport, 1950)—a widely validated
psychological
construct
(Arminjon,
2011)
associated
with
creativity (Suler, 1980)—is characterized phenomenologically by
“
image fusion; unlikely combinations or events; sudden shifts
or transformations of images; and contradictory or illogical
actions, feelings, or thoughts”(Kraehenmann et al., 2017a, p. 2).
Psilocybin and LSD have been shown to increase primary-
process thinking (Martindale and Fischer, 1977; Natale et al.,
1978a; Family et al., 2016; Kraehenmann et al., 2017a) as well
as the subjective bizarreness and dreamlike nature of mental
imagery associated with verbal stimuli (Carhart-Harris et al.,
2015; Kraehenmann et al., 2017b). Cognitive flexibility (or
‘
loosening’of cognition) and optimism can remain for up
to 2 weeks after the main acute drug effects have dissipated
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b). Furthermore, long-term increases
in creative problem-solving ability (Sweat et al., 2016) and
personality trait openness (MacLean et al., 2011; Lebedev
et al., 2016) have been measured after just one psychedelic
experience.
Ego Effects and Ego Dissolution
Experiences
Klüver (1926, p. 513) observed that under peyote “
the line of
demarcation drawn between ‘
object’
and ‘
subject’
in normal state
seemed to be changed. The body, the ego, became ‘
objective’
in a certain way, and the objects became ‘
subjective.”
’Similar
observations continued throughout first-wave and second-wave
psychedelic science (Beringer, 1927b; Klüver, 1928; Savage, 1955;
Eisner and Cohen, 1958; Klee, 1963; Leary et al., 1964; Grof,
1976). Importantly, effects on sense of self and ego occur along
a dose-dependent range spanning from subtle to drastic (Letheby
and Gerrans, 2017; Milliè
re, 2017). Subtle effects are described
as a ‘
softening’of ego with increased insight into one’
s own
habitual patterns of thought, behavior, personal problems, and
past experiences; effects which were utilized in ‘
psycholytic’
psychotherapy (Grof, 1980). Drastic ego-effects, known as ego
dissolution3, are described as “
the dissolution of the sense of self
and the loss of boundaries between self and world”(Milliè
re,
2017, p. 1) —e.g., ‘
I felt like I was merging with my surroundings’
or ‘
All notion of self and identity dissolved away’or ‘
I lost
all sense of ego’or ‘
I experienced a loss of separation from
my environment’or ‘
I felt at one with the universe’(Dittrich
et al., 2010; Nour et al., 2016; Milliè
re, 2017). These descriptions
resemble non-drug ‘
mystical-type’experiences (James, 1902;
Huxley, 1945; Stace, 1960; Forman, 1998; Baumeister and Exline,
2002); however, the extent of overlap here remains an open
question (Hood, 2001; Maclean et al., 2012; Barrett and Griffiths,
2017; Milliè
re, 2017; Winkelman, 2017). Ego dissolution is more
likely to occur at higher doses (Griffiths et al., 2011; Studerus
et al., 2011, 2012; Liechti et al., 2017). Furthermore, certain
psychedelic drugs cause ego dissolution experience more reliably
than others; psilocybin, for example, was found to produce
full ego dissolution more reliably compared with LSD (Liechti
et al., 2017). Ego dissolution experiences can be driven and
modulated by external stimuli, most notably music (Carhart-
Harris et al., 2016c; Atasoy et al., 2017b; Kaelen et al., 2018).
Interestingly, subjects who experienced ‘
complete’

therapeutic utility of psychedelic drugs in treating a wide range of
mental health issues (Tupper et al., 2015; Lieberman and Shalev,
2016; Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017), including anxiety and
depression (Grob et al., 2011; Gasser et al., 2014; Carhart-Harris
et al., 2016a, 2017a; Dos Santos et al., 2016; Griffiths et al., 2016;
Ross et al., 2016), obsessive-compulsive disorder (Moreno et al.,
2006), and addiction (Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016) to alcohol
(Bogenschutz et al., 2015) and tobacco (Johnson et al., 2014). In
many clinical studies, ego-dissolution experience has correlated
with positive clinical outcomes (Griffiths et al., 2008, 2016; Maji´
c
et al., 2015; Ross et al., 2016; Roseman et al., 2017).
Remarkably, as mentioned above, a single psychedelic
experience can increase optimism for at least 2 weeks after the
session (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b) and can produce lasting
changes in personality trait openness (MacLean et al., 2011;
Lebedev et al., 2016). A study of regular (weekly) ayahuasca users
showed improved cognitive functioning and increased positive
personality traits compared with matched controls (Bouso
et al., 2015). Interestingly, these outcomes may expand beyond
sanctioned clinical use, as illicit users of classic psychedelic drugs
within the general population self-report positive long-term
benefits from their psychedelic experiences (Carhart-Harris and
Nutt, 2010), are statistically less likely to evidence psychological
distress and suicidality (Hendricks et al., 2015; Argento et al.,
2017), and show an overall lower occurrence of mental health
problems in general (Krebs and Johansen, 2013).
Summary
The above evidence demonstrates the broad diversity of acute
subjective effects that classic psychedelic drugs can produce in
perceptual, emotional, and cognitive domains. Unique changes
in sense of self, ego, body image, and personal meaning are
particularly salient themes. How do these molecules produce
such dramatic effects? What are the relationships between acute
perceptual, emotional, cognitive, and self-related effects? What is
the link between acute effects and long-term changes in mental
health, personality, and behavior? Theories addressing these
questions emerged as soon as Western science recognized the
need for a scientific understanding of psychedelic drug effects
beginning in the late 19th century.
19th AND 20th CENTURY THEORIES OF
PSYCHEDELIC DRUG EFFECTS
The effects described above are what captured the interest
of first-wave and second-wave psychedelic scientists, and the
theories they developed in their investigations have two central
themes. The first theme is the observation that psychedelic effects
share descriptive elements with symptoms of psychoses, such as
hallucination, altered self-reference, and perceptual distortions.
This theme forms the basis of model psychoses theory and is what
motivated the adoption of the term ‘
psychotomimetic’
drugs. The
second theme is the observation that psychedelic drugs seem to
expand the total range of contents presented subjectively in our
perceptual, emotional, cognitive, and self-referential experience.
This theme forms the basis of filtration theory and is what
motivated the adoption of the term ‘
psychedelic’
drugs. A third
theoretical account uses psychoanalytic theory to address the
expanded range of mental phenomena produced by psychedelic
drugs as well as the shared descriptive elements with symptoms of
psychoses. The next section reviews these themes along with their
historically associated theories before tracing their evolution into
third-wave (21st-century) psychedelic science.
Model Psychoses Theory
When Lewin (1894, 1927) ‘
discovered’
4 the peyote cactus,
his reports caught the attention of adventurous 19th-century
scientists like Prentiss and Morgan (1895), Mitchell (1896),
and Ellis (1898), who promptly obtained samples and began
consuming the cactus and observing its effects on themselves.
When Heffter (1898) isolated mescaline from the peyote cactus
and Späth (1919) paved the way for laboratory synthesis,
scientists began systematically dosing themselves (along with
their colleagues and students) with mescaline and publishing
their findings in medical journals (Knauer and Maloney, 1913;
Klüver, 1926; Beringer, 1927b; Rouhier, 1927; Guttmann, 1936;
Stockings, 1940). Klüver (1926), intrigued by the approach of
Knauer and Maloney (1913), ingested peyote at the University
of Minnesota Psychological Laboratory and, after the effects
had taken hold, completed standard psychophysical measures.
Klüver (1926, p. 502) argued that systematic investigations
into the neural mechanisms of mescaline effects would help
neurology “
elucidate more general questions of the psychology
and pathology of perception.”However, it was the pathology
aspect, not the general psychology questions, which became the
dominant focus of ensuing mescaline research paradigms.
Model psychoses theory began long before any of the classic
psychedelic drugs became known to Western science. Moreau
(1845) linked hashish effects with mental illness and Kraepelin
(1892) founded “
pharmacopsychology”by dosing himself and
his students with various psychoactive drugs in the laboratory
of Wilhelm Wundt (Müller et al., 2006; Schmied et al., 2006).
These scientists hoped to study psychotic symptoms using drugs
to induce ‘
model psychoses’(1) in themselves, to gain first-
person knowledge of the phenomenology of psychotic symptoms
by “
administering to one another such substances as will
produce in us transitory psychoses”(Knauer and Maloney, 1913,
p. 426; see also Guttmann, 1936), and (2) in normal research
subjects, allowing for laboratory behavioral observations on how
the symptoms emerge and dissipate. Kraepelin and colleagues
attempted to model psychoses using many drugs—“
tea, alcohol,
morphine, trional, bromide, and other drugs”
—yet Kraepelin’
s
pupils Knauer and Maloney (1913, p. 426) argued that these
drugs unfortunately “
produce mental states which have little
similarities to actual insanities”and argued instead that mescaline
was unique in its ability to truly model psychoses. The dramatic
subjective effects of mescaline invigorated the model psychoses
paradigm. Growing demand for the ideal chemical agent for

attention had not been paid by American scientists to this intoxicant used by the

Unifying Theories of Psychedelic Drug Effects
model psychoses eventually motivated Sandoz Pharmaceuticals
to bring LSD to market in the 1940s.5
Importantly, model psychoses theory was not initially a
theory of drug effects; it was an idealistic paradigm for
researching psychoses that was already in use before Western
science ‘
discovered’classic psychedelic drugs. Nonetheless, it
seeded the idea that psychedelic effects themselves could
be explained in terms of psychopathology and motivated a
search for common neural correlates. The founding figures
of neuropharmacology were driven by questions regarding
the relationship between psychoactive drugs and endogenous
neurochemicals (see Abramson, 1956). The putative psychoses-
mimicking effects of LSD and mescaline inspired the idea
that psychotic symptoms might be caused by a “
hypothetical
endotoxin” (Osmond, 1957, p. 422) or some yet-unknown
endogenous neurochemical gone out of balance (Osmond and
Smythies, 1952; Abramson, 1956; Himwich, 1959). The discovery
that LSD can antagonize serotonin led to the hypothesis that the
effects of LSD are serotonergic and simultaneously to the historic
hypothesis6 that serotonin might play a role in regulating mental
function (Gaddum, 1953; Gaddum and Hameed, 1954; Woolley
and Shaw, 1954; Shaw and Woolley, 1956; Green, 2008).
At the 1955 Second Conference on Neuropharmacology the
whole class of drugs was dubbed psychotomimetic (Abramson,
1956). Interestingly, the word mimetic means to “
imitate”
“
mimic” or “
exhibit mimicry” which is the act of appearing
as something else—for example, when one species mimics the
appearance or behavior of another (e.g., the non-venomous
bullsnake rattles its tail against dry leaves to mimic a venomous
rattlesnake). Psychotomimetic drug effects, on this literal reading
of the term, would merely mimic or imitate—appear as if
they are—psychoses. However, to mimic is not to model.7 A
model intends to capture important structural or functional
principles of the entity or phenomena that it models. A mimic,
by contrast, merely creates the illusion that it possesses the
properties it mimics. Thus, the term psychotomimetic implies
that the effects of these drugs merely resemble psychoses but do
not share functional or structural properties in their underlying
biology or phenomenology. Nonetheless, LSD and mescaline
were used as models to investigate psychotic symptoms. Yet the
scientific utility of drug models hinges on our understanding
of the mechanisms underpinning the drugs’effects; we still
need a theory of how psychotomimetic drugs work. A subtle
explanation-explananda circularity can come into play here,
in which psychoses are explained using drug models yet the
drug effects are explained using theories of psychoses. Further
complicating the matter is the clear difference between acutely
5A marketing team at Sandoz Pharmaceuticals sent free samples of LSD to
physicians around the world and inside each package was a pamphlet which read:
“
By taking Delysid [LSD] himself, the psychiatrist is able to gain an insight into the
world of ideas and sensations of mental patients. Delysid can also be used to induce
model psychoses of short duration in normal subjects, thus facilitating studies on
the pathogenesis of mental disease”(Hofmann, 1980, p. 47).
6In this sense LSD catalyzed the neuroscientific revolution of serotonin
neurochemistry (Nichols, 2016) and crystallized the emergence of the field of
neuropharmacology.
7In fact, in the terminology of biological science, a model is “
an organism whose
appearance a mimic imitates”(Merriam-Webster, 2017).
induced drug effects and the gradual development of a chronic
mental illness (Osmond and Smythies, 1952). This cluster of
conceptual challenges poured fuel on the flaming debates about
the merits of drug-induced model psychoses, which in 1957 had
already “
smoldered for nearly 50 years”(Osmond, 1957, p. 421).
An additional conceptual challenge was the fact that mescaline
had for years shown promise in treating psychopathologies
(Beringer, 1927b; Rouhier, 1927) and LSD was gaining popularity
for pharmaceutically enhanced psychotherapy (Sandison and
Whitelaw, 1957; Eisner and Cohen, 1958; Cohen and Eisner,
1959). Model psychoses theory needed to explain how it was
the case that drugs putatively capable of inducing psychotic
symptoms could simultaneously be capable of treating them—
What Osmond (1957, p. 420) termed the “
hair of the dog”
problem. In fact, to this day “
the apparent paradox by which the
same compound can be both a model of, and yet a treatment for,
psychopathology has never been properly addressed”(Carhart-
Harris et al., 2016b, p. 2). Taken together, the above cluster
of conceptual challenges drove Osmond (1957) to doubt his
own prior work on model psychoses (Hoffer et al., 1954; i.e.,
Osmond and Smythies, 1952) and he declared ‘
psychotomimetic’
an outmoded term, arguing that the effects of these drugs
could not be captured wholly in terms of psychopathology. “
If
mimicking mental illness were the main characteristic of these
agents, ‘
psychotomimetics’would indeed be a suitable generic
term. It is true that they do so, but they do much more”
(Osmond,
1957, p. 429).
Filtration Theory
Osmond (1957) argued that the ‘
psychotomimetic’
class of drugs
needed a more appropriate name. “
My choice, because it is
clear, euphonious, and uncontaminated by other associations,
is psychedelic, mind-manifesting” (Osmond, 1957, p. 429).
But how exactly should we understand psychedelic effects as
‘
mind-manifesting’
? Osmond’
s nomenclature legacy was directly
influenced by his friend Aldous Huxley, who described the core
idea to Osmond in the following personal letter dated April 10,
1953 (Huxley, 1953, p. 29):
Dear Dr. Osmond,
...
It looks as though the most satisfactory working hypothesis about
the human mind must follow, to some extent, the Bergsonian
model, in which the brain with its associated normal self,
acts as a utilitarian device for limiting, and making selections
from, the enormous possible world of consciousness, and
for canalizing experience into biologically profitable channels.
Disease, mescaline, emotional shock, aesthetic experience and
mystical enlightenment have the power, each in its different way
and in varying degrees, to inhibit the function of the normal self
and its ordinary brain activity, thus permitting the ‘
other world’
to rise into consciousness.
Yours sincerely,
Aldous Huxley
Huxley’
s letter can help unpack the intended ‘
mind-
manifesting’etymology of Osmond’
s new term psychedelic.

Unifying Theories of Psychedelic Drug Effects
FIGURE 3 | Aldous Huxley’s “cerebral reducing valve.” On the ‘inlet’ (right)
side of the cerebral reducing valve is a vast ocean of all possible perceptual,
emotional, and cognitive experiences. On the ‘outlet’ (left) side is our
moment-to-moment stream of experience in normal waking life. Mechanisms
inside the valve ‘reduce’ the character and contents of experience,
‘canalizing’ the ocean of possible experience into a more limited stream of
waking consciousness aimed at maximum biological utility.
to sustain the “
normal self”of everyday waking experience to
maximize adaptive fit. Huxley’
s choice metaphor for visualizing
this was the cerebral reducing valve (Figure 3).
“
What I have called the cerebral reducing valve [is a] normal
brain function that limits our mental processes to an awareness,
most of the time, of what is biologically useful” (Huxley,
1999, p. 121). Huxley (1961b, p. 193) argued that this “
normal
brain function”emerges developmentally during the course of
psychological maturity, so for a period during childhood, before
the cerebral reducing valve has fully developed, “
there is this
capacity to live in a kind of visionary world.”Once the valve is
fully developed, however, normal waking life becomes restricted
to a “
world fabricated by our everyday, biologically useful and
socially conditioned perceptions, thoughts and feelings”(Huxley,
1961a, p. 214).
Huxley borrowed the core idea from 19th-century filtration
theory accounts of various mental phenomena (see Marshall,
2005): “
According to filtration theorists, consciousness is
ordinarily kept narrow by biological and psychological selection
processes that exclude a great deal of subconscious material”
(Marshall, 2005, p. 233). Filtration theorists include founding
figures of psychopharmacology (Kraepelin, 1892), psychology
(James, 1890), and parapsychology (Myers, 1903), along with
early 20th-century philosophers Bergson (1911, 1931) and Broad
(1923). Bergson (1931) applied his own filtration framework
to drug effects in his brief response to James’(1882) glowing
descriptions of what it is like to inhale nitrous oxide. James’
peculiar state of mind, explained Bergson, should be thought
of as a latent potential of the brain/mind, which nitrous
oxide simply “
brought about materially, by an inhibition of
what inhibited it, by the removing of an obstacle; and this
effect was the wholly negative one produced by the drug”
(Bergson, 1931). Huxley picked up Bergson’
s line of thinking
and eventually convinced Osmond that it was important to
reflect this principle in scientific descriptions of the effects of
LSD and mescaline. Smythies (1956, p. 96) also subscribed
to this idea, stating that “
mescaline may be supposed to
inhibit that function in the brain which specifically inhibits
the mescaline phenomena from developing in the sensory
fields.”
Thus,

theory. In this new descriptive model, psyche (mind) delic
(manifesting) drugs manifest the mind by inhibiting certain
brain processes which normally maintain their own inhibitory
constraints on our perceptions, emotions, thoughts, and sense of
self. Osmond (1957) and Huxley (1991) both found this principle
highly applicable to their own direct first-person knowledge of
what it is like to experience the effects of mescaline and LSD—
the expanded range of feelings, intensification of perceptual
stimuli, vivid vision-like mental imagery, unusual thoughts, and
expanding (or dissolving) sense of self and identity.

and
improve
our
understanding of (1) the diverse range of psychedelic effects,
(2) their relationship to psychotic symptoms, and (3) their
role in psychedelic-assisted therapies. First, the pharmacological
disruption of hypothetical inhibitory brain mechanisms that
normally attenuate internal and external stimuli suggested that
the kinds of effects produced by the drug would depend on the
kinds of stimuli in the system, which is consistent with the diverse
range of effects on multiple perceptual modalities, emotional
experience, and cognition.

the mind, causing a rigid, dull, neurotic life in which mental
contents become overly restricted to “
those enumerated in the
Sears-Roebuck catalog which constitutes the conventionally
‘

and Osmond understand the relationship between psychedelic
phenomena and psychotic phenomena: temporarily opening
the cerebral reducing valve with psychedelics could produce
mental phenomena that resembled symptoms of chronic natural
psychoses precisely because both were the result of (acute or
chronic) reductions in brain filtration mechanisms.
Third and finally, filtration theory addressed the paradoxical

theory offered a way to understand psychedelic effects that was
consistent with both their psychotomimetic properties and their
therapeutic utility.
Osmond and Huxley argued that filtration theory concepts

capability,
and

of
psychedelic drugs. However, it remains unclear exactly what
it is that the brain is filtering and consequently what it is that
emerges when the filter is pharmacologically perturbed by a
psychedelic drug. According to Huxley, LSD and mescaline
“
inhibit the function of the normal self and its ordinary
brain activity, thus permitting the ‘
other world’to rise into
consciousness”(Huxley, 1953, p. 29; emphasis mine). Huxley
(and Bergson) spoke of the brain as a device that filters the
world and when the filter is removed we experience ‘
more’of
reality. Osmond’
s ‘
mind-manifesting’(psyche) (delic) name,
by contrast, suggests that these drugs permit latent aspects
of mind to rise into conscious awareness. So which is it? Do
psychedelic drugs manifest latent aspects of mind or of world?
How we answer this question will crucially determine our
ontological and epistemological conclusions regarding the
nature of psychedelic experience. Huxley and Osmond did
not make this clear. Huxley seems to favor the position that
psychedelic experience reveals a wider ontological reality and
grants epistemic access to greater truth. Osmond’
s view, on
which these drugs reveal normally hidden aspects of mind,
seems less radical, more compatible with materialist science,
and less epistemically and ontologically committed. Still, if
mind provides us with access to world, then lifting restrictions
on mind could in principle expand our access to world. This
important point resurfaces in section “
Predictive Processing”
below.
Psychoanalytic Theory
Freud (1895) developed an elaborate theoretical account of
mental phenomena which, like filtration theory, placed great
emphasis on inhibition mechanisms in the nervous system.8
Freud divided the psyche into two fundamentally distinct modes
of activity: the primary process and the secondary process (Freud,
1895, 1940). In the primary process, the exchange of “
neuronal
energy” is “
freely mobile” and its psychological dynamics
are characterized by disorder, vagueness, conceptual paradox,
symbolic imagery, intense emotions, and animistic thinking
(Freud, 1940, p. 164). In the secondary process, by contrast, the
exchange of neuronal energy is “
bound”and its psychological
dynamics are characterized by order, precision, conceptual
consistency, controlled emotions, and rational thinking (Freud,
1895, 1940). Freud (1895) hypothesized that the secondary
process is maintained by an organizing neural “
mass”called
the ego which “
contains”and exerts control over the primary
8Huxley was overtly critical of Freud, yet Huxley’
s cerebral reducing valve is
strikingly similar to Freud’
s ego (see Benton, 2016 for a comparison of Freud and
Bergson).
process by binding primary process activity into its own pattern
of activity.9 Freud hypothesized that secondary process neural
organization, sustained by the ego, is required for certain aspects
of perceptual processing, directed attention, reality-testing, sense
of linear time, and higher cognitive processes (Freud, 1895,
1940). When Freud’
s ego is suppressed, such as during dream
sleep, wider worlds of experience can emerge, but secondary
process functions are lost. The secondary process and its
supporting neural organizing pattern—the ego—emerges during
ontogenetic development and solidifies with adult maturity: “
A
unity comparable to the ego cannot exist from the start; the
ego has to be developed”(Freud, 1915, p. 77). Furthermore,
pathological characteristics can emerge when Freud’
s ego restricts
either too much or too little of the primary process.
Freud himself was apparently uninterested in psychedelic
drugs and instead emphasized dreams as “
the royal road
to a knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind”
(Freud, 1900, p. 769). Nonetheless, psychedelic drugs produce
dreamlike visions and modes of cognition that feature symbolic
imagery, conceptual paradox, and other hallmark characteristics
of the primary process (Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2010;
Kraehenmann et al., 2017a; Sanz and Tagliazucchi, 2018).
How did other psychoanalytic theorists describe psychedelic
drug effects? The core idea is that psychedelic drugs interfere
with the structural integrity of the ego and thereby reduce
its ability to suppress the primary process and support
the secondary process (Grof, 1976). This ‘
frees’the primary
process which then spills into conscious awareness, resulting
in perceptual instability, wildly vivid imagination, emotional
intensity, conceptual paradox, and loss of usual self-boundaries.
Due in part to the close resemblance between psychedelic effects
and primary process phenomena, psychoanalytic theory became
the framework of choice during the mid 20th-century boom in
psychedelic therapy (Sandison, 1954; Sandison and Whitelaw,
1957; Cohen, 1965; Grof, 1976; Merkur, 1998). Psychedelic ego
effects, which range from a subtle loosening to a complete
dissolution of ego boundaries, were found to be great tools in
psychotherapy because of their capacity to perturb ego and allow
primary process phenomena to emerge (Sandison, 1954, p. 509).
But how do psychedelic drugs disrupt the structure of the
ego? Freud hypothesized that the organizational structure of ego
rests upon a basic perceptual schematic of the body and its
surrounding environment. Perceptual signals are continuously
‘
bound’
and integrated into the somatic boundaries of the ego.
Savage (1955) speculated that the LSD’
s perceptual effects and
ego effects are tightly linked. “
LSD acts by altering perception.
Continuous correct perception is necessary to maintain ego
feeling and ego boundaries. . . . Perception determines our ego
boundaries. . . . disturbances in perception caused by LSD make
9“
The secondary process is characterized by a bound state in the neurone, which
though there is a high cathexis, permits only a small current. . . Now the ego itself
is a mass like this of neurones which hold fast to their activity—are, that is in a
bound state and this surely can only happen as a result of the effect they have on
one another. We can therefore imagine that a perceptual neurone which is active
with attention is as a result temporarily, as it were, taken up into the ego and is
now subject to the same binding of its energy as are all the other ego neurones. . .
This bound state, which combines high activity with small current, would thus
characterize processes of thought mechanically”(Freud, 1895, p. 368).

Unifying Theories of Psychedelic Drug Effects
it impossible for the ego to integrate the evidence of the senses
and to coordinate its activities . . .”(Savage, 1955, p. 14). Klee
(1963) expanded Savage’
s insights into a set of hypotheses aimed
at elucidating the neurobiological mechanisms of a Freudian
‘
stimulus barrier’
and its dissolution under LSD:
Such barriers would presumably consist of processes limiting the
spread of excitation between different functional areas of the
brain. The indications are that LSD, in some manner, breaks
down these stimulus barriers of which Freud spoke. Nor is this
merely a figure of speech. There is some reason to suspect that
integrative mechanisms within the central nervous system (CNS)
which handle inflowing stimuli are no longer able to limit the
spread of excitation in the usual ways. We might speculate that
LSD allows greater energy exchanges between certain systems
than normally occurs, without necessarily raising the general level
of excitation of all cortical and subcortical structures. (Klee, 1963,
p. 465; emphasis mine).
Freud hypothesized that ego is sustained by a delicate
balance of ‘
neuronal energy’ which critically depends on
integrative mechanisms to process inflowing sensory stimuli
and to ‘
bind’
neural excitation into functional structures within
the brain. Psychedelic drugs, according to Savage and Klee,
perturb integrative mechanisms that normally bind and shape
endogenous and exogenous excitation into the structure of the
ego. As we will see below, Klee’
s ideas strongly anticipate many
neurophysiological findings (Alonso et al., 2015; Tagliazucchi
et al., 2016; Schartner et al., 2017) and theoretical themes
(Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2010; Letheby and Gerrans, 2017)
from 21st-century psychedelic science.
Summary
From the above analysis of first-wave and second-wave theories
I have identified four recurring theoretical features which could
potentially serve as unifying principles. One feature is the
hypothesis that psychedelic drugs inhibit a core brain mechanism
that normally functions to ‘
reduce’
or ‘
filter’
or ‘
constrain’
mental
phenomena into an evolutionarily adaptive container. A second
feature is the hypothesis that this core brain mechanism can
behave pathologically, either in the direction of too much, or
too little, constraint imposed on perception, emotion, cognition,
and sense of self. A third feature is the hypothesis that
psychedelic phenomena and symptoms of chronic psychoses
share descriptive elements because they both involve situations
of relatively unconstrained mental processes. A fourth feature
is the hypothesis that psychedelic drugs have therapeutic utility
via their ability to temporarily inhibit these inhibitory brain
mechanisms. But how are these inhibitory mechanisms realized
in the brain?

neurophysiological evidence. “
As far as I am aware, however,
adequate neurophysiological evidence is lacking . . . The long
awaited millennium in which biochemical, physiological, and
psychological processes can be freely correlated still seems a great
distance off”(Klee, 1963, p. 466, 473). What clues have recent
investigations uncovered?
A psychedelic drug molecule impacts a neuron by binding
to and altering the conformation of receptors on the surface
of the neuron (Nichols, 2016). The receptor interaction most
implicated in producing classic psychedelic drug effects is agonist
or partial agonist activity at serotonin (5-HT) receptor type 2A
(5-HT2A) (Nichols, 2016). A molecule’
s propensity for 5-HT2A
affinity and agonist activity predicts its potential for (and
potency of) subjective psychedelic effects (Glennon et al., 1984;
McKenna et al., 1990; Halberstadt, 2015; Nichols, 2016; Rickli
et al., 2016). When a psychedelic drug’
s 5-HT2A agonist activity
is intentionally blocked using 5-HT2A antagonist drugs (e.g.,
ketanserin), the subjective effects are blocked or attenuated in
humans under psilocybin (Vollenweider et al., 1998; Kometer
et al., 2013), LSD (Kraehenmann et al., 2017a,b; Preller et al.,
2017), and ayahuasca (Valle et al., 2016). Importantly, while
the above evidence makes it clear that 5-HT2A activation
is a necessary (if not sufficient) mediator of the hallmark
subjective effects of classic psychedelic drugs, this does not
entail that 5-HT2A activation is the sole neurochemical cause
of all subjective effects. For example, 5-HT2A activation might
trigger neurochemical modulations ‘
downstream’
(e.g., changes
in glutamate transmission) which could also play causal roles in
producing psychedelic effects (Nichols, 2016). Moreover, most
psychedelic drug molecules activate other receptors in addition to
5-HT2A (e.g., 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C, dopamine, sigma, etc.) and these
activations may importantly contribute to the overall profile of
subjective effects even if 5-HT2A activation is required for their
effects to occur (Ray, 2010, 2016).
How
does
psychedelic
drug-induced
5-HT2A
receptor
agonism change the behavior of the host neuron? Generally, 5-
HT2A activation has a depolarizing effect on the neuron, making
it more excitable (more likely to fire) (Andrade, 2011; Nichols,
2016). Importantly, this does not necessarily entail that 5-HT2A
activation will have an overall excitatory effect throughout the
brain, particularly if the excitation occurs in inhibitory neurons
(Andrade, 2011). This important consideration (captured by the
adage ‘
one neuron’
s excitation is another neuron’
s inhibition’
)
should be kept in mind when tracing causal links in the
pharmaco-neurophysiology of psychedelic drug effects.
In mammalian brains, neurons tend to ‘
fire together’in
synchronized rhythms known as temporal oscillations (brain
waves). MEG and EEG equipment measure the electromagnetic
disturbances produced by the temporal oscillations of large
neural populations and these measurements can be quantified
according to their amplitude (power) and frequency (timing)
(Buzsáki and Draguhn, 2004). Specific combinations of frequency
and amplitude can be correlated with distinct brain states,
including waking ‘
resting’ state, various attentional tasks,
anesthesia, REM sleep, and deep sleep (Tononi and Koch,
2008; Atasoy et al., 2017a). In what ways do temporal
oscillations change under psychedelic drugs? MEG and EEG

studies consistently show reductions in oscillatory power across
a broad frequency range under ayahuasca (Riba et al., 2002,
2004; Schenberg et al., 2015; Valle et al., 2016), psilocybin
(Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013; Kometer et al., 2015; Schartner
et al., 2017), and LSD (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016c; Schartner
et al., 2017). Reductions in the power of alpha-band oscillations,
localized mainly to parietal and occipital cortex, have been
correlated with intensity of subjective visual effects—e.g., ‘
I saw
geometric patterns’or ‘
My imagination was extremely vivid’
—
under psilocybin (Kometer et al., 2013; Muthukumaraswamy
et al., 2013; Schartner et al., 2017) and ayahuasca (Riba et al.,
2004; Valle et al., 2016). Under LSD, reductions in alpha
power still correlated with intensity of subjective visual effects
but associated alpha reductions were more widely distributed
throughout the brain (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016c). Furthermore,
ego-dissolution effects and mystical-type experiences (e.g.,
‘
I experienced a disintegration of my “
self”or “
ego”
’or ‘
The
experience had a supernatural quality’
) have been correlated
with reductions in alpha power localized to anterior and
posterior cingulate cortices and the parahippocampal regions
under psilocybin (Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013; Kometer
et al., 2015) and throughout the brain under LSD (Carhart-Harris
et al., 2016c).
The concept of functional connectivity rests upon fMRI
brain imaging observations that reveal temporal correlations
of activity occurring in spatially remote regions of the brain
which form highly structured patterns (brain networks) (Buckner
et al., 2013). Imaging of brains during perceptual or cognitive
task performance reveals patterns of functional connectivity
known as functional networks; e.g., control network, dorsal
attention network, ventral attention network, visual network,
auditory network, and so on. Imaging brains in taskless
resting conditions reveals resting-state functional connectivity
(RSFC) and structured patterns of RSFC known as resting state
networks (RSNs; Deco et al., 2011). One particular RSN, the
default mode network (DMN; Buckner et al., 2008), increases
activity in the absence of tasks and decreases activity during
task performance (Fox and Raichle, 2007). DMN activity is
strong during internally directed cognition and a variety of
other ‘
metacognitive’functions (Buckner et al., 2008). DMN
activation in normal waking states exhibits ‘
inverse coupling’
or anticorrelation with the activation of task-positive functional
networks, meaning that DMN and functional networks are often
mutually exclusive; one deactivates as the other activates and vice
versa (Fox and Raichle, 2007).
In what ways does brain network connectivity change under
psychedelic drugs? First, functional connectivity between key
‘
hub’
areas—mPFC and PCC—is reduced. Second, the ‘
strength’
or oscillatory power of the DMN is weakened and its intrinsic
functional connectivity becomes disintegrated as its component
nodes become decoupled under psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al.,
2012, 2013), ayahuasca (Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015), and
LSD (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016c; Speth et al., 2016). Third,
brain networks that normally show anticorrelation become
active simultaneously under psychedelic drugs. This situation,
which can be described as increased between-network functional
connectivity, occurs under psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012,
2013; Roseman et al., 2014; Tagliazucchi et al., 2014), ayahuasca
(Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015) and especially LSD (Carhart-Harris
et al., 2016c; Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). Fourth and finally, the
overall repertoire of explored functional connectivity motifs is
substantially expanded and its informational dynamics become
more diverse and entropic compared with normal waking states
(Tagliazucchi et al., 2014, 2016; Alonso et al., 2015; Lebedev et al.,
2016; Viol et al., 2016; Atasoy et al., 2017b; Schartner et al.,
2017). Notably, the magnitude of occurrence of the above four
neurodynamical themes correlates with subjective intensity of
psychedelic effects during the drug session. Furthermore, visual
cortex is activated during eyes-closed psychedelic visual imagery
(de Araujo et al., 2012; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016c) and under
LSD “
the early visual system behaves ‘
as if’it were receiving
spatially localized visual information”
as V1-V3 RSFC is activated
in a retinotopic fashion (Roseman et al., 2016, p. 3036).
Taken together, the recently discovered neurophysiological
correlates of subjective psychedelic effects present an important
puzzle for 21st-century neuroscience. A key clue is that 5-HT2A
receptor agonism leads to desynchronization of oscillatory
activity, disintegration of intrinsic integrity in the DMN
and related brain networks, and an overall brain dynamic
characterized by increased between-network global functional
connectivity, expanded signal diversity, and a larger repertoire
of structured neurophysiological activation patterns. Crucially,
these characteristic traits of psychedelic brain activity have been
correlated with the phenomenological dynamics and intensity of
subjective psychedelic effects.
21st-CENTURY THEORIES OF
PSYCHEDELIC DRUG EFFECTS
How should we understand the growing body of clues emerging
from investigations into the neurodynamics of psychedelic
effects? What are the principles that link these thematic
patterns of psychedelic brain activity (or inactivity) to their
associated phenomenological effects? Recent theoretical efforts
to understand psychedelic drug effects have taken advantage of
existing frameworks from cognitive neuroscience designed to
track the key neurodynamic principles of human perception,
emotion, cognition, and consciousness. The overall picture that
emerges from these efforts shares core principles with filtration
and psychoanalytic accounts of the late 19th and early 20th
century. Briefly, normal waking perception and cognition are
hypothesized to rest upon brain mechanisms which serve to
suppress entropy and uncertainty by placing various constraints
on perceptual and cognitive systems. In a ‘
selecting’
and ‘
limiting’
fashion, neurobiological constraint mechanisms support stability
and predictability in the contents of conscious awareness in
the interest of adaptability, survival, and evolutionary fitness.
The core hypothesis of recent cognitive neuroscience theories
of psychedelic effects is that these drugs interfere with the
integrity of neurobiological information-processing constraint
mechanisms. The net effect of this is that the range of possibilities
in perception, emotion, and cognition is dose-dependently
expanded. From this core hypothesis, cognitive neuroscience

Unifying Theories of Psychedelic Drug Effects
frameworks are utilized to describe and operationalize the
quantitative neurodynamics of key psychedelic phenomena;
namely, the diversity of effects across many mental processes,
the elements in common with symptoms of psychoses, and the
way in which temporarily removing neurobiological constraints
is therapeutically beneficial.
This section is organized according to the broad theoretical
frameworks
informing
recent
theoretical
neuroscience
of
psychedelic effects: entropic brain theory, integrated information
theory, and predictive processing.
Entropic Brain Theory
Entropic Brain Theory (EBT; Carhart-Harris et al., 2014) links
the phenomenology and neurophysiology of psychedelic effects
by characterizing both in terms of the quantitative notions
of entropy and uncertainty. Entropy is a quantitative index
of a system’
s (physical) disorder or randomness which can
simultaneously describe its (informational) uncertainty. EBT
“
proposes that the quality of any conscious state depends on the
system’
s entropy measured via key parameters of brain function”
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, p. 1). Their hypothesis states that
hallmark psychedelic effects (e.g., perceptual destabilization,
cognitive flexibility, ego dissolution) can be mapped directly
onto elevated levels of entropy/uncertainty measured in brain
activity, e.g., widened repertoire of functional connectivity
patterns,
reduced
anticorrelation
of
brain
networks,
and
desynchronization of RSN activity. More specifically, EBT
characterizes the difference between psychedelic states and
normal waking states in terms of how the underlying brain
dynamics are positioned on a scale between the two extremes
of order and disorder—a concept known as ‘
self-organized
criticality’
(Beggs and Plenz, 2003). A system with high order (low
entropy) exhibits dynamics that resemble ‘
petrification’
and are
relatively inflexible but more stable, while a system with low order
(high entropy) exhibits dynamics that resemble ‘
formlessness’
and are more flexible but less stable. The notion of ‘
criticality’
describes the transition zone in which the brain remains poised
between order and disorder. Physical systems at criticality exhibit
increased transient ‘
metastable’states, increased sensitivity to
perturbation, and increased propensity for cascading ‘
avalanches’
of metastable activity. Importantly, EBT points out that these
characteristics are consistent with psychedelic phenomenology,
e.g., hypersensitivity to external stimuli, broadened range of
experiences, or rapidly shifting perceptual and mental contents.
Furthermore, EBT uses the notion of criticality to characterize
the difference between psychedelic states and normal waking
states as it “
describes cognition in adult modern humans as ‘
near
critical’
but ‘
sub-critical’
—meaning that its dynamics are poised
in a position between the two extremes of formlessness and
petrification where there is an optimal balance between order and
flexibility”(Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, p. 12). EBT hypothesizes
that psychedelic drugs interfere with ‘
entropy-suppression’
brain
mechanisms which normally sustain sub-critical brain dynamics,
thus bringing the brain “
closer to criticality in the psychedelic
state”(Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, p. 12).
Entropic Brain Theory further characterizes psychedelic
neurodynamics using a neo-psychoanalytic framework proposed
in an earlier paper by Carhart-Harris and Friston (2010, p. 1265)
where they “
recast some central Freudian ideas in a mechanistic
and biologically informed fashion.” Freud’
s primary process
(renamed “
primary consciousness”
) is hypothesized to be a
high-entropy brain dynamic which operates at criticality, while
Freud’
s secondary process (renamed “
secondary consciousness”
)
is hypothesized to involve a lower-entropy brain state which
sustains a sub-critical dynamic via a key neurobiological entropy-
suppression mechanism—the ego—which exerts an organizing
influence in order to constrain the criticality-like dynamic of
primary consciousness. EBT argues that these ego functions
have a signature neural footprint; namely, the DMN’
s intrinsic
functional connectivity and DMN coupling of medial temporal
lobes (MTLs) in particular. Furthermore, EBT argues that
DMN/ego develops ontogenetically in adult humans and plays an
adaptive role in which it sustains secondary consciousness and
associated metacognitive abilities (Shimamura, 2000; Fleming
et al., 2012) along with an “
integrated sense of self”(Carhart-
Harris et al., 2014, p. 9).
Importantly, this hypothesis maps onto the subjective
phenomenology
of
psychedelic
effects,
particularly
ego
dissolution. As psychedelics weaken the oscillatory power
and intrinsic functional connectivity of the DMN, the normally
constrained activity of subordinate DMN nodes—MTLs in
particular—becomes “
freely mobile”allowing the emergence of
more uncertain (higher entropy) primary consciousness. This
view, based on Freudian metapsychology, is also consistent
with filtration accounts, like those of Bergson and Huxley, who
hypothesized that psychedelic drug effects are the result of a
pharmacological inhibition of inhibitory brain mechanisms. EBT
recasts these theoretical features using the quantitative terms
of physical entropy and informational uncertainty as measured
via “
the repertoire of functional connectivity motifs that form
and fragment across time”(Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, p. 1).
In normal waking states, the DMN constrains the activity of
its cortical and subcortical nodes and prohibits simultaneous
co-activation with TPNs. By interfering with DMN integration,
psychedelics permit a larger repertoire of brain activity, a wider
variety of explored functional connectivity motifs, co-activation
of normally mutually exclusive brain networks, increased levels
of between-network functional connectivity, and an overall more
diverse set of neural interactions.
Carhart-Harris
et
al.
(2014)
point
out
a
number
of
implications of EBT. First, they map the feelings of ‘
uncertainty’
that often accompany psychedelic effects onto the fact that a more
entropic brain dynamic is the information-theoretic equivalent
to a more ‘
uncertain’brain dynamic. “
Thus, according to the
entropic brain hypothesis, just as normally robust principles
about the brain lose definition in primary states, so confidence
is lost in ‘
how the world is’
and ‘
who one is’
as a personality”
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, p. 16).
Second, like Huxley’
s cerebral reducing valve and Freud’
s ego,
EBT argues that the DMN’
s organizational stronghold over brain
activity can be both an evolutionary advantage and a source of
pathology. “
It is argued that this entropy-suppressing function
of the human brain serves to promote realism, foresight, careful
reflection and an ability to recognize and overcome wishful and

paranoid fantasies. Equally however, it could be seen as exerting
a limiting or narrowing influence on consciousness”(Carhart-
Harris et al., 2014, p. 7). Carhart-Harris et al. (2014) point out that
neuroimaging studies have implicated increased DMN activity
and RSFC with various aspects of depressive rumination, trait
neuroticism, and depression. “
The suggestion is that increased
DMN activity and connectivity in mild depression promotes
concerted introspection and an especially diligent style of reality-
testing. However, what may be gained in mild depression (i.e.,
accurate reality testing) may be offset by a reciprocal decrease
in flexible or divergent thinking (and positive mood)”(Carhart-
Harris et al., 2014, p. 10).
Third, consistent with both psychoanalytic and filtration
theory, is the notion that psychedelic drugs’ capacity to
temporarily weaken, collapse, or disintegrate the normal
ego/DMN
stronghold
underpins
their
therapeutic
utility.
“
Specifically, it is proposed that psychedelics work by dismantling
reinforced patterns of negative thought and behavior by breaking
down the stable spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity upon
which they rest”(Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, p. 1).
Fourth and finally, EBT sheds light on the shared descriptive
elements between psychedelic effects and psychotic symptoms
by characterizing both in terms of elevated levels of entropy
and uncertainty in brain activity which lead to a “
regression”
into primary consciousness. The collapse of the organizing effect
of DMN coupling and anticorrelation patterns, according to
EBT, point to “
system-level mechanics of the psychedelic state
as an exemplar of a regressive style of cognition that can also
be observed in REM sleep and early psychosis”(Carhart-Harris
et al., 2014, p. 5).
Thus, EBT formulates all four of the theoretical features
identified in filtration and psychoanalytic accounts, but does so
using 21st-century empirical data plugged into the quantitative
concepts of entropy, uncertainty, criticality, and functional
connectivity. EBT hints at possible ways to close the gaps
in understanding by offering quantitative concepts that link
phenomenology to brain activity and pathogenesis to therapeutic
mechanisms.
Integrated Information Theory
Integrated Information Theory (IIT) is a general theoretical
framework
which
describes
the
relationship
between
consciousness and its physical substrates (Oizumi et al.,
2014; Tononi, 2004, 2008). While EBT is already loosely
consistent with the core principles of IIT, Gallimore (2015)
demonstrates how EBT’
s hypotheses can be operationalized
using the technical concepts of the IIT framework. Using EBT
and recent neuroimaging data as a foundation, Gallimore
develops an IIT-based model of psychedelic effects. Consistent
with EBT, this IIT-based model describes the brain’
s continual
challenge of minimizing entropy while retaining flexibility.
Gallimore formally restates this problem using IIT parameters:
brains attempt to optimize the give-and-take dynamic between
cause-effect information and cognitive flexibility. In IIT, a
(neural) system generates cause-effect information when the
mechanisms which make up its current state constrain the set of
states which could casually precede or follow the current state.
In other words, each mechanistic state of the brain: (1) limits
the set of past states which could have causally given rise to it,
and (2) limits the set of future states which can causally follow
from it. Thus, each current state of the mechanisms within
a neural system (or subsystem) has an associated cause-effect
repertoire which specifies a certain amount of cause-effect
information as a function of how stringently it constrains the
unconstrained state repertoire of all possible system states.
Increasing the entropy within a cause-effect repertoire will
in effect constrain the system less stringently as the causal
possibilities are expanded in both temporal directions as the
system moves closer to its unconstrained repertoire of all possible
states. Moreover, increasing the entropy within a cause-effect
repertoire equivalently increases the uncertainty associated with
its past (and future) causal interactions. Using this IIT-based
framework, Gallimore (2015) argues that, compared with normal
waking states, psychedelic brain states exhibit higher entropy,
higher cognitive flexibility, but lower cause-effect information
(Figure 4).
Neuroimaging data suggests that human brains exhibit a
larger overall repertoire of neurophysiological states under
psychedelic drugs, exploring a greater diversity of states in
a more random fashion. For example, in normal waking
states, DMN activity ‘
rules out’the activity of TPNs, and vice
versa, due to their relatively strict anticorrelation patterns.
Brain network anticorrelation generates cause-effect information
because it places constraints on the possible causal interactions
within and between brain mechanisms; for example, DMN-
TPN anticorrelation patterns ‘
rule out’
the DMN activity in the
presence of activated TPNs. However, psychedelic drugs ‘
dissolve’
DMN-TPN (and other) network anticorrelation patterns, which
FIGURE 4 | “Increasing neural entropy elevates cognitive flexibility at the
expense of a decrease in the cause-effect information specified by individual
mechanisms” (Gallimore, 2015, p. 10).

Unifying Theories of Psychedelic Drug Effects
permits simultaneous activation of brain networks which are
normally mutually exclusive. The cause-effect repertoire of brain
mechanisms thus shifts closer to the unconstrained repertoire
of all possible past and future states. This has the effect of
“
increasing the probability of certain states from zero or, at
least, from a very low probability” (Gallimore, 2015, p. 7).
Therefore the subjective contents perception and cognition
become more diverse, more unusual, and less predictable.
This increases flexibility but decreases precision and control as
the subjective boundaries which normally demarcate distinct
cognitive concepts and perceptual objects dissolve. Gallimore
leverages IIT in an attempt unify these phenomena under a
formalized framework.
However, as Gallimore notes, “
this model does not explain
how neural entropy is increased by (psychedelic drugs), but
predicts consequences of the entropy increase revealed by
functional imaging data” (Gallimore, 2015, p. 7). How do
psychedelic drugs increase neural entropy?
Predictive Processing
The first modern brain imaging measurements in humans under
psilocybin yielded somewhat unexpected results: reductions
in oscillatory power (MEG) and cerebral blood flow (fMRI)
correlated with the intensity of subjective psychedelic effects
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2012; Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013). In
their discussion, the authors suggest that their findings, although
surprising through the lens of commonly held beliefs about how
brain activity maps to subjective phenomenology, may actually
be consistent with a theory of brain function known as the free
energy principle (FEP; Friston, 2010).
In one model of global brain function based on the free-energy
principle (Friston, 2010), activity in deep-layer projection neurons
encodes top-down inferences about the world. Speculatively,
if deep-layer pyramidal cells were to become hyperexcitable
during the psychedelic state, information processing would be
biased in the direction of inference—such that implicit models
of the world become spontaneously manifest—intruding into
consciousness without prior invitation from sensory data. This
could explain many of the subjective effects of psychedelics
(Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013, p. 15181).
What is FEP? “
In this view, the brain is an inference
machine that actively predicts and explains its sensations. Central
to this hypothesis is a probabilistic model that can generate
predictions, against which sensory samples are tested to update
beliefs about their causes”(Friston, 2010). FEP is a formulation
of a broader conceptual framework emerging in cognitive
neuroscience known as predictive processing (PP; Clark, 2013)10.
PP has links to bayesian brain hypothesis (Knill and Pouget, 2004),
predictive coding (Rao and Ballard, 1999), and earlier theories of
perception and cognition (MacKay, 1956; Neisser, 1967; Gregory,
1968) dating back to Helmholtz (1925) who was inspired by Kant
(1996; see Swanson, 2016). At the turn of the 21st century, the
ideas of Helmholtz catalyzed innovations in machine learning
(Dayan et al., 1995), new understandings of cortical organization
10See also Clark (2015) and Wiese and Metzinger (2017) for introductory reviews
conceptual overviews.
(Mumford, 1992; Friston, 2005), and theories of how perception
works (Kersten and Yuille, 2003; Lee and Mumford, 2003).
PP subsumes key elements from these efforts (see Clark, 2013)
to describe a universal principle of brain function captured by
the idea of prediction error minimization (PEM; Hohwy, 2013).
What does it mean to say that the brain works to minimize
its own prediction error? Higher-level areas of the nervous
system (i.e., higher-order cortical structures) generate top-down
synaptic ‘
predictions’
aimed at matching the expected bottom-
up synaptic activity at lower-level areas, all the way down to
‘
input’activity at sense organs. Top-down signals encode a
kind of ‘
best guess’about the most likely (hidden)11 causes
of bodily sensations. In this multi-level hierarchical cascade of
neural activity, high-level areas attempt to ‘
explain’
the states of
levels below via synaptic attempts to inhibit lower-level activity—
“
high-level areas tell lower levels to ‘
shut up”
’(Kersten et al.,
2004, p. 297). But lower levels will not ‘
shut up’until they
receive top-down feedback (inference) signals that adequately fit
(explain) the bottom-up (evidence) signals. Mismatches between
synaptic ‘
expectation’
and synaptic ‘
evidence’
generate prediction
error signals which ‘
carry the news’
by propagating the ‘
surprise’
upward to be ‘
explained away’
by yet higher levels of hierarchical
cortical processing anatomy (see Clark, 2015). This recurrent
neural processing scheme approximates (empirical) Bayesian
inference (Friston and Stephan, 2007) as the brain continually
maps measured bodily effects to different sets of possible causes
and attempts to select the set of possible causes that can best
‘
explain away’the measured bodily effects. Crucially, the sets
of possible causes must be narrowed in order for the system
to settle on an explanation (Tenenbaum et al., 2011). Prior
constraints which allow the system to narrow the hypothesis
space are known as ‘
inductive biases’
or priors (Kemp et al., 2007;
Tenenbaum et al., 2011; Clark, 2013). Efforts in Bayesian statistics
and machine learning have demonstrated that improvements
in inductive capabilities occur when priors are linked in a
multi-level hierarchy, with “
not just a single level of hypotheses
to explain the data but multiple levels: hypothesis spaces of
hypothesis spaces, with priors on priors”
(Tenenbaum et al., 2011,
p. 1282). Certain priors in the hierarchy, known as ‘
hyperpriors’
(Friston et al., 2013) or ‘
overhypotheses’
(Goodman, 1983; Kemp
et al., 2007) are more abstract and allow the system to ‘
rule out’
large swaths of possibilities, drastically narrowing the hypothesis
space, making explanation more tractable (Blokpoel et al., 2012).
For example, the brute constraints of space and time act as
hyperpriors; e.g., prior knowledge “
that there is only one object
(one cause of sensory input) in one place, at a given scale, at a
given moment,”or the fact that “
we can only perform one action
at a time, choosing the left turn or the right but never both at
once”(Clark, 2013, p. 196).
Thus, PP states that brains are neural generative models
built from linked hierarchies of priors where higher levels
continuously attempt to ‘
guess’and explain activity at lower
levels. The entire process can be characterized as the agent’
s
11The causes of our bodily sensations cannot be directly observed by the brain: an

(Hohwy, 2013) and limited to a ‘

Unifying Theories of Psychedelic Drug Effects
attempt to optimize its own internal model of the sensorium (and
the world) over multiple spatial and temporal scales (Friston,
2010).
Interestingly, PP holds that our perceptions of external objects
recruit the same synaptic pathways that enable our capacity for
mental imagery, dreaming, and hallucination. The brain’
s ability
to ‘
simulate’
its own ‘
virtual reality’
using internal (generative)
models of the world’
s causal structure is thus crucial to its
ability to perceive the external world. “
[A] fruitful way of
looking at the human brain, therefore, is as a system which,
even in ordinary waking states, constantly hallucinates at the
world, as a system that constantly lets its internal autonomous
simulational dynamics collide with the ongoing flow of sensory
input, vigorously dreaming at the world and thereby generating
the content of phenomenal experience”(Metzinger, 2003).
How do psychedelic molecules perturb predictive processing?
If normal perception is a kind of ‘
controlled hallucination’
(see Clark, 2015) where top-down simulation is constrained by
bottom-up sensory input colliding with priors upon priors, then,
as the above quotation from Muthukumaraswamy et al. (2013)
suggests, psychedelic drugs essentially cause perception to be
less controlled hallucination. The idea is that psychedelic drugs
perturb the (learned and innate) prior constraints on internal
generative models. Via their 5-HT2A agonism, psychedelic drugs
cause hyperexcitation in layer V pyramidal neurons, which might
cause endogenous simulations to ‘
run wild’so that awareness
becomes more imaginative, dreamlike, and hallucinatory. This
hypothesis could in principle still be consistent with observed
reductions in brain activity under psychedelics; recall from above
that, in PP schemes, the higher-level areas ‘
explain away’
lower-
level excitation by suppressing it with top-down inhibitory signals.
“
Here, explaining away just means countering excitatory bottom-
up inputs to a prediction error neuron with inhibitory synaptic
inputs that are driven by top-down predictions”(Friston, 2010,
p. 130).
How does PP tie into filtration theories and psychoanalytic
accounts? Carhart-Harris et al. (2012) link Huxley with Friston
to interpret their initially surprising fMRI scans of humans under
psilocybin (see also Zizo, 2013). One objection to this linkage
might be that Huxley often describes psychedelic opening of
the cerebral reducing valve as revealing more of the world. At
first glance this seems at odds with the above PP account of
psychedelic effects, which describes psychedelic drugs causing
rampant internal simulations of reality, not revealing more of the
external world. However, this apparent tension might be resolved
in light of active inference, a key principle of FEP (Friston,
2010). Active inference shows how internal models do not merely
generate top-down (inference) signals but also shape the sampling
and accumulation of bottom-up sensory (evidence) signals. “
In
short, the agent will selectively sample the sensory inputs that
it expects. This is known as active inference. An intuitive
example of this process (when it is raised into consciousness)
would be feeling our way in darkness: we anticipate what we
might touch next and then try to confirm those expectations”
(Friston, 2010, p. 129). The principle of active inference hints at
a resolution to the apparent tensions between Osmond’
s ‘
mind-
manifesting’model and Huxley’
s ‘
world-manifesting’model.
Psychedelics manifest mind by perturbing prior constraints on
internal generative models, thereby expanding the possibilities
in our inner world of feelings, thoughts, and mental imagery.
Importantly, this could also manifest normally ignored aspects of
world by altering active inference, which would in effect expand
the sampling of sensory data to include samples that are normally
routinely ‘
explained away.’
Potentially, this understanding goes
some way in explaining the perception-hallucination continuum
of psychedelic drug effects (reviewed above) as it shows how
perceptual intensifications, on the one hand, and distortions and
hallucinations, on the other hand, could both be caused by a
synaptic disruption of hierarchically linked priors in internal
generative models.
The brief speculative remark by Muthukumaraswamy et al.
(2013) is not the only PP-based account of psychedelic drug
effects. The PP framework describes a recurrent back-and-
forth give-and-take between colliding top-down and bottom-up
signals, where internal models serve to shape experience and
experience serves to build internal models, so this leaves room
for rival PP-based accounts that diverge regarding where exactly
the psychedelic drug perturbs the system. For example, increased
top-down activity could be the result of pharmacological
hyperactivation of top-down synaptic transmission; yet equally
plausible is the hypothesis that increased top-down activity
is a compensatory response to pharmacological attenuations or
distortions of bottom-up signal.
For example, Corlett et al. (2009, p. 521) hypothesize that
LSD hallucinations result from “
noisy, unpredictable bottom-up
signaling in the context of preserved and perhaps enhanced top-
down processing.”In contrast to the PP-based account outlined
above, which focuses on changes to top-down signals, the strategy
of Corlett et al. (2009) is to map various psychedelic effects to
disturbances of top-down and/or bottom-up signals. The issue
of what is primary and what is compensatory illustrates the vast
possibilities in the hypothesis space of PP-based accounts.
While most PP-based accounts point to changes in top-down
signaling, even within this hypothesis space there are contrasting
conceptions of exactly how psychedelic molecules perturb top-
down processing. Briefly, these differing hypotheses include:
(1) hyperactivation or heavier weighting of top-down signaling
(Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013; described above), (2) reduced
influence of signals from higher cortical areas (Carhart-Harris
and Friston, 2010; McKenna and Riba, 2015), (3) interference
with multisensory integration processes and PP-based binding of
sensory signals (Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2010; Letheby and
Gerrans, 2017; Milliè
re, 2017), and (4) changes in the composition
and level of detail specified by top-down signals (Pink-Hashkes
et al., 2017).
Carhart-Harris and Friston (2010) argue that the Freudian
conception of ego, with its organizing influence over the primary
process, is consistent with PP descriptions of higher-level cortical
structures predicting and suppressing the excitation in lower
levels in the hierarchy (i.e., limbic regions). Freud hypothesized
that the secondary process binds, integrates, and organizes the
‘
lower’
and more chaotic neural activity of the primary process
into the broader and more cohesive composite structure of
the ego. Carhart-Harris and Friston (2010) argue that when

Unifying Theories of Psychedelic Drug Effects
large-scale intrinsic networks become dis-integrated, the activity
at lower levels can no longer be ‘
explained away’
(suppressed)
by certain higher-level systems, causing conscious awareness
to take on hallmark characteristics of the primary process. In
normal adult waking states, networks based in higher-level areas
can successfully predict and explain (suppress and control)
the activity of lower level areas. “
In non-ordinary states, this
function may be perturbed (e.g., in the case of hallucinogenic
drugs, through actions at modulatory post-synaptic receptors),
compromising the hierarchical organization and suppressive
capacity of the intrinsic networks”(Carhart-Harris and Friston,
2010, p. 1274).
Similar PP-based theories of psychedelic ego dissolution have
been proposed without invoking Freud (Letheby and Gerrans,
2017; Milliè
re, 2017). PP posits that the brain explains self-
generated stimuli by attributing its causes to a coherent and
persisting entity (i.e., the self), much like how it predicts
and explains external stimuli by attributing their causes to
coherent and persisting external objects (see also Limanowski
and Blankenburg, 2013; Allen and Friston, 2016; Letheby and
Gerrans, 2017; Milliè
re, 2017). Letheby and Gerrans (2017)
use the PP framework to recast the psychoanalysis-based
theories of LSD ego effects proposed by Savage (1955)12 and
Klee (1963) described in Section “
Psychoanalytic Theory.”The
core idea is that psychedelic drugs interfere with processes
that bind and integrate stimuli according to probabilistic
estimates of how relevant the stimuli are to the organism’
s
(self) goals. Letheby and Gerrans (2017, p. 7) point out
that ego dissolution under psychedelic drugs is correlated
with the desynchronization (reductions in intrinsic functional
connectivity) of brain networks implicated in “
one aspect or
another of self-representation”
—specifically the salience network
(SLN) and the DMN (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). This causes an
‘
unbinding’
of stimuli that are normally processed according to
self-binding multisensory integration mechanisms. “
Attention is
no longer guided exclusively by adaptive and egocentric goals
and agendas; salience attribution is no longer bound to personal
concern”(Letheby and Gerrans, 2017, p. 6). This description
echoes Huxley’
s cerebral reducing valve “
in which the brain
with its associated normal self, acts as a utilitarian device for
limiting, and making selections from, the enormous possible
world of consciousness, and for canalizing experience into
biologically profitable channels”(Huxley, 1999, p. 29; emphasis
mine). Letheby and Gerrans’PP-based account elucidates how
psychedelic drugs could perturb the brain’
s “
associated normal
self”preventing the usual self-binding of internal and external
stimuli.
Pink-Hashkes et al. (2017, p. 2907) argue that under
psychedelic drugs “
top-down predictions in affected brain areas
break up and decompose into many more overly detailed
predictions due to hyper activation of 5-HT2A receptors in layer
V pyramidal neurons.” Pink-Hashkes et al. (2017) state that
when internal generative models are described as categorical
12“
Disturbances in perception caused by LSD make it impossible for the ego to
integrate the evidence of the senses and to coordinate its activities . . .”(Savage,
1955, p. 14).
probability distributions rather than Gaussian densities (Friston
et al., 2015; Kwisthout et al., 2017), “
the state space granularity
(how detailed are the generative models and the predictions that
follow from them) is crucial”(Kwisthout et al., 2017, p. 2; see
also Kwisthout and van Rooij, 2015). Categorical predictions that
are less detailed will ‘
explain’more bottom-up data (because
they cover more ground) and thus produce less prediction
error. Categorical predictions that are more detailed, by contrast,
will carry less precision and thus potentially generate more
prediction error (Kwisthout and van Rooij, 2015; Kwisthout
et al., 2017). Pink-Hashkes et al. (2017, p. 2908) propose that
psychedelic drugs cause brain structures at certain levels of
the cortical hierarchy to issue more detailed (less abstract)
‘
decomposed’
predictions that “
fit less data than the ‘
usual’
broad
prediction.”They argue that many psychedelic effects stem from
the brain’
s attempts to compensate for these decomposed top-
down predictions as it responds to the increase in prediction
errors that result from overly detailed predictions.
In summary, the current state of PP-based theories of
psychedelic effects reveals a divergent mix of heterogeneous ideas
and conflicting hypotheses. Do psychedelic molecules perturb
top-down (feedback) signaling, or bottom-up (feedforward)
signaling,
or
both?
Do
the
subjective
phenomenological
effects result from direct neuropharmacological changes or
compensatory
mechanisms
responding
to
pharmacological
perturbations? Yet there seems to be a core intuition that
transcends the conceptual variance here: psychedelic drugs
(somehow) interfere with established priors that normally
constrain the brain’
s internal generative models.
Predictive processing-based accounts, consistent with EBT
and IIT (and filtration and psychoanalytic accounts), propose
that psychedelic drugs disrupt neural mechanisms (priors
on internal generative models) which normally constrain
perception and cognition. Perturbing priors causes subjective
phenomenology to present a wider range of experiences with
increased risk of perceptual instability and excessive cognitive
flexibility. As prior constraints on self and world are loosened, the
likelihood of psychosis-like phenomena increases. At the same
time, novel thinking is increased and the brain becomes more
malleable and conducive to therapeutic cognitive and behavioral
change.
CONCLUSION
The four key features identified in filtration and psychoanalytic
accounts from the late 19th and early 20th century continue to
operate in 21st-century cognitive neuroscience: (1) psychedelic
drugs produce their characteristic diversity of effects because
they perturb adaptive mechanisms which normally constrain
perception, emotion, cognition, and self-reference, (2) these
adaptive mechanisms can develop pathologies rooted in either
too much or too little constraint (3) psychedelic effects appear
to share elements with psychotic symptoms because both involve
weakened constraints (4) psychedelic drugs are therapeutically
useful precisely because they offer a way to temporarily inhibit
these adaptive constraints. It is on these four points that EBT,

IIT, and PP seem consistent with each other and with earlier
filtration and psychoanalytic accounts. EBT and IIT describe
psychedelic brain dynamics and link them to phenomenological
dynamics, while PP describes informational principles and
plausible neural information exchanges which might underlie
the larger-scale dynamics described by EBT and IIT. Certain
descriptions of neural entropy-suppression mechanisms (EBT),
cause-effect information constraints (IIT), or prediction-error
minimization strategies (PP, FEP) are loosely consistent with
Freud’
s ego and Huxley’
s cerebral reducing valve.
In
surveying
the
literature
for
this
review
I
can
confidently conclude that 21st-century psychedelic science
has yet to approach a unifying theory linking the diverse
range of phenomenological effects with pharmacology and
neurophysiology while tying these to clinical efficacy. However,
the historically necessary ingredients for successful theory
unification—formalized frameworks and unifying principles
(Morrison, 2000)—seem to be taking shape. Formal models
are an integral part of 21st-century neuroscience (Forstmann
et al., 2011) where they help to describe natural principles in
the brain and aid explanation and understanding (Kay, 2017).13
Here I have reviewed a handful of formalized frameworks—
EBT, IIT, PP—which are just beginning to be used to account
for psychedelic effects. I have also highlighted the fact that
all of the accounts reviewed here, from the 19th-century
to the 21st-century, propose that psychedelic drugs inhibit
neurophysiological constraints in order to produce their diverse
phenomenological, psychotomimetic, and therapeutic effects.
Why should we pursue a unified theory of psychedelic drug
effects at all? To date, theories of brain function and mind in
general have resisted the kind of unification that has occurred
in other areas of science (Huang, 2008; Edelman, 2012). Because
the human brain has evolved disparate and complex layers under
diverse environmental circumstances, many doubt the possibility
of and debate the merits of seeking ‘
grand unified theories’
(GUTs) of brain function. “
There is every reason to think that
13 This remains true regardless of the outcome of healthy debates about the nature
and proper use of models in science (Frigg and Hartmann, 2017).
there can be no grand unified theory of brain function because
there is every reason to think that an organ as complex as the
brain functions according to diverse principles”(Anderson and
Chemero, 2013, p. 205). Indeed, Anderson and Chemero (2013,
p. 205) caution that “
we should be skeptical of any GUT of
brain function”and charge that PP in particular, when taken
as a unified theory as outlined by Clark (2013), “
threatens
metaphysical disaster.”
Given these understandable critical reservations about seeking
after GUTs of brain function (and therefore any truly unifying
theory of psychedelic drug effects), it is perhaps safer to
aspire for theories that feature “
broad explanatory frameworks”
and offer “
conceptual breadth”allowing us to “
paint the big
picture” (Edelman, 2012). PP and FEP, at the very least,
offer a broad explanatory framework that emcompasses a
large swath of perceptual and cognitive phenomena (Huang,
2008; Friston, 2010; Clark, 2015). Psychedelic drugs offer a
unique way to iteratively develop and test such big-picture
explanatory frameworks: these molecules can be used to probe
the links between neurochemistry and neural computation across
multiple layers of neuroanatomy and phenomenology. Meeting
the challenge of predicting and explaining psychedelic drug
effects is the ultimate acid test for any unified theory of brain
function.
