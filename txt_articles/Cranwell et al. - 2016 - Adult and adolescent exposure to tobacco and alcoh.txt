ABSTRACT
Background We estimate exposure of British adults
and adolescents to tobacco and alcohol content from a
sample of popular YouTube music videos.
Methods British viewing figures were generated from 2
representative online national surveys of adult and
adolescent viewing of the 32 most popular videos
containing content. 2068 adolescents aged 11–18 years
(1010 boys, 1058 girls), and 2232 adults aged 19
+years (1052 male, 1180 female) completed the
surveys. We used the number of 10 s intervals in the 32
most popular videos containing content to estimate the
number of impressions. We extrapolated gross and per
capita impressions for the British population from census
data and estimated numbers of adults and adolescents
who had ever watched the sampled videos.
Results From video release to the point of survey, the
videos delivered an estimated 1006 million gross
impressions of alcohol (95% CI 748 to 1264 million),
and 203 million of tobacco (95% CI 151 to 255
million), to the British population. Per capita exposure
was around 5 times higher for alcohol than for tobacco,
and nearly 4 times higher in adolescents, who were
exposed to an average of 52.1 (95% CI 43.4 to 60.9)
and 10.5 (95% CI 8.8 to 12.3) alcohol and tobacco
impressions, respectively, than in adults (14.1 (95% CI
10.2 to 18.1) and 2.9 (95% CI 2.1 to 3.6)). Exposure
rates were higher in girls than in boys.
Conclusions YouTube music videos deliver millions of
gross impressions of alcohol and tobacco content.
Adolescents are exposed much more than adults. Music
videos are a major global medium of exposure to such
content.
INTRODUCTION
It is well established that young people exposed to
depictions of tobacco and alcohol content in films
are more likely to start smoking or to consume
alcohol,1–8 but the effect of imagery in other
media,
including
new
online
media
such
as
YouTube music videos, has received relatively little
attention. It is becoming clear, however, that some
music
videos
contain
substantial
tobacco
and
alcohol imagery,9–11 including branding, and that
these portrayals are often positive.10
In the UK, paid-for placement of tobacco pro-
ducts in music videos is prohibited by the Tobacco
Advertising and Promotion Act 2002 (TAPA), but
this law does not apply to videos produced outside
the UK.12 Alcohol promotion is much less tightly
controlled, being subject only to a code of conduct
issued by the independent Advertising Standards
Authority (ASA) and by voluntary codes or prac-
tice, including that produced by the Portman
Group, a not-for-profit organisation funded by 11
member companies accounting for more than half
the UK alcohol market.13 14 All are broadly consist-
ent with ASA guidance that “Marketing communi-
cations for alcoholic drinks should not be targeted
at people under 18 and should not imply, condone
or encourage immoderate, irresponsible or anti-
social drinking”.15
Since music videos tend to be most popular with
younger audiences, it is most likely that tobacco
and alcohol content promote use of both of these
products, and that paid-for alcohol content contra-
venes these codes of practice. However, the extent
to which adults and adolescents are exposed to
tobacco or alcohol content from YouTube or other
online music has not been quantified. W
e have
therefore estimated population exposure to tobacco
and alcohol impressions, defined as appearances in
10 s intervals in a sample of popular videos, in the
British adolescent and adult population.
METHODS
Procedure
Video content data
Video content data were taken from semiquantita-
tive interval coding of tobacco and alcohol content
in a previously reported sample of 110 YouTube
music videos from the most popular top 40 chart
songs in the UK in the 12 weeks from Sunday 3
November 2013 to Sunday 19 January 2014.9
Alcohol or tobacco actual use, implied use, para-
phernalia and brand appearances were each coded
as present or absent in visual imagery and lyrical
content in successive 10 s intervals of the video.
The interval coding system was a slightly modified
version of that previously successfully used in televi-
sion and film, the details of which we discuss else-
where.9 16 17 For the present study, we combined
these exposure categories into a single measure of
any alcohol or tobacco content in each interval, and
selected the 32 most popular videos by chart pos-
ition containing either tobacco or alcohol imagery
for inclusion in our surveys. These 32 videos con-
tained a total of 821 10 s intervals for analysis, of
which 47 and 233, respectively, included tobacco
and alcohol content. Electronic cigarettes appeared
in six intervals. Our financial resources allowed for
the inclusion of 32 of the 40 videos only.

 out by YouGov PLC. The survey of adolescents, which was
carried out in conjunction with the public health charity Action
on Smoking and Health (ASH), involved 2068 young people
(1010 boys and 1058 girls) aged 11–18 years surveyed between
21 March and 1 April 2014, and headline results have been
reported in our previous study.9 The adult survey involved 2232
adults (1052 males and 1180 females) aged 19 years and over
and was carried out on 14 and 15 July 2014. The surveys were
designed to reduce coverage bias and to be representative by
age, gender and region for adolescents and by age, gender,
region, social grade and newspaper readership for adults. All
participants were asked if they had ever seen each of the 32
videos selected for the survey. Both YouGov surveys were
carried out in accordance with the Market Research Society
(MRS) and the British Polling Council (BPC).
Statistical analyses
W
e combined the survey data to estimate proportions of the
UK population, broken down by age and gender, that had seen
the videos; the video content data with the number of inter-
vals containing any alcohol or tobacco content by video; and
official UK population mid-year estimates (2012–2013) by age
and gender to compute gross impressions for the whole British
population.18 19 Per capita gross impressions were obtained by
dividing total gross impressions by the population in each
age and gender group. All analyses were carried out using
Stata V
.13.20
RESULTS
Our results suggest that, at the point of survey, the proportion
of adolescents who had viewed the 32 music videos was 0.22
(95% CI 0.19 to 0.26), and of adults 0.06 (95% CI 0.04 to
0.08, table 1), and that the videos delivered a total of 1006
million alcohol gross impressions (95% CI (748 to 1264
million), and 203 million tobacco gross impressions (95% CI
151 to 255 million), to the British population. On average, the
videos were available for 7.1 and 10.6 months for adolescents
and adults, respectively, since the date of the video release. The
majority of gross impressions were delivered to adults, and par-
ticularly those in the 25–34 age group. However, the propor-
tions of the population exposed were highest in adolescents,
and per capita impressions were nearly four times higher, at
52.11 (95% CI 43.36 to 60.86) and 10.51 (95% CI 8.75 to
12.28) for alcohol and tobacco, respectively, in adolescents than
in adults (14.13 (95% CI 10.21 to 18.05) and 2.85 (95% CI
2.06 to 3.64), respectively, table 1).i The general characteristics
of the percentage of videos watched are presented in online sup-
plementary appendix 1.
Tobacco impressions
The highest number of gross tobacco impressions per capita
occurred in the 13–18 age group, with each adolescent aged
between 13–15 years and 16–18 years receiving an average of
11.48 (95% CI 9.83 to 13.14) and 10.50 (95% CI 8.44 to
12.56) impressions from these videos, respectively, while the
figure per adult was 2.85 (95% CI 2.06 to 3.64) impressions
per capita. Exposure in adolescents was around 65% higher in
girls than in boys (13.04 (95% CI 10.71 to 15.38) and 7.86
(95% CI 6.52 to 9.19) impressions per capita, respectively
(table 1), but the highest numbers of tobacco impressions per
capita were delivered to girls aged 13–15 years (figure 1).
Alcohol impressions
The pattern of exposure to alcohol impressions by age and
gender was the same as for tobacco, but the number of impres-
sions was approximately five times higher. Thus, an estimated
average of 52.11 (95% CI 43.36 to 60.86) and 14.13 (95% CI
10.21 to 18.05) gross impressions of alcohol were delivered,
respectively, to each adolescent and adult (table 1). In the age
groups of 13–15 and 16–18 years, per capita impressions were,
respectively, 56.93 (95% CI 48.73 to 65.13) and 52.07 (95%
CI 41.85 to 62.29), and the highest exposure of 70.68 impres-
sions per capita occurred in girls aged 13–15 years (figure 1).
Tobacco and alcohol impressions delivered by individual
music videos
Most of the music artists and bands (including main collabora-
tors) were British (21), followed by American (11), then Dutch,
Swedish, Canadian and from New Zealand (4, 3, 3 and 1,
respectively). A breakdown of estimated adult and adolescent
tobacco and alcohol impressions delivered by individual videos
in the sample and music genre is provided in online supplemen-
tary table S2. For the whole population, the highest number of
tobacco impressions was delivered by the video ‘Trumpets’ by
Jason Derulo, which of a total of 36.80 (95% CI 32.31 to
41.30) million gross impressions delivered, 12.27 (95% CI
11.46
to
13.09)
million
were
delivered
to
adolescents.
However, per capita, this video delivered 2.07 (95% CI 1.94 to
2.21) tobacco impressions to adolescents compared with only
0.50 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.57) to the adult group. The same
pattern was found in the videos ‘Love Me Again’ by John
Newman and ‘Blurred Lines’ by Robin Thicke (featuring
Pharrell Williams) which overall delivered the second and third
most tobacco gross impressions; per capita, these videos both
delivered more impressions to adolescents compared with the
adult group at 0.75 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.81) vs 0.24 (95% CI
0.21 to 0.28) and 0.49 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.51) vs 0.25 (95% CI
0.24 to 0.27), respectively.
For the whole population, the highest number of alcohol
gross impressions was generated by the video ‘Timber’ by
Pitbull (featuring Ke$ha), delivering a total of 162.59 (95% CI
145.47 to 179.7) impressions including 44.47 (95% CI 41.71
to 47.22) million delivered to adolescents. However, per capita,
the same video delivered 7.52 (95% CI 7.05 to 7.98) adolescent
tobacco impressions compared with only 2.40 (95% CI 2.11 to
2.69) to the adult group. The videos ‘Best Song Ever’ by One
Direction and ‘Drunk in Love’ by Beyoncé (featuring Jay-Z)
again followed a similar pattern delivering the second and third
most tobacco impressions to the whole population; per capita,
these videos each delivered more adolescent alcohol impressions
compared with the adult group at (7.99 (95% CI 7.59 to 8.40)
vs 2.01 (95% CI 1.77 to 2.25) and 5.48 (95% CI 5.09 to 5.88)
vs 1.99 (95% CI 1.74 to 2.25)), respectively. More tobacco and
alcohol content, per capita, is therefore reaching adolescents
than adults.
DISCUSSION
This is the first study to estimate the extent to which music
videos deliver tobacco or alcohol imagery and lyrics to adults
and adolescents. It demonstrates that this small sample of
videos, which was among the most popular in the UK over a
12-week period from late 2013, delivered over 1.2 billion 10 s
intervals containing tobacco or alcohol content to the British

 population. Approximately one-third of these impressions were
delivered to people aged 11–18, and per capita rates in this
age group were nearly four times higher than in adults.
Impressions per capita were also much higher in girls than in
boys. If these levels of exposure were typical then in 1 year,
music videos would be expected to deliver over four billion
impressions of alcohol, and nearly one billion of tobacco, in
Britain alone. Further, the number of impressions has been cal-
culated on the basis of on one viewing only; however, many of
the videos had been watched multiple times (see online supple-
mentary appendix 1), so this number is likely to be much
bigger.
Our findings are consistent with previous research that found
a larger sample of movies delivered 13.9 billion gross smoking
impressions, an average of 665 to each US adolescent aged
10–14 years, and adds to the wider substance exposure research
by including, for the first time, alcohol content reach.19 Since
many of the popular songs in our sample were globally as well
as nationally successful, it is evident that music videos are a
major global as well as national medium of exposure to imagery
that promotes smoking and alcohol consumption.
Legislation
prohibiting
paid-for
placement
of
branded
tobacco products has been in place since 2002 in the UK, and
many other countries apply similar restrictions. It is therefore
unlikely that tobacco brand appearances in UK-made music
videos are funded by the tobacco industry, though the possibility
remains that funding of generic imagery still occurs. The associ-
ation between exposure to smoking imagery and smoking in
films and uptake of smoking occurs even when branding is
absent, which suggests that the effect of such exposure on the
likelihood of smoking initiation is unrelated to branding.21
Tobacco companies still therefore have an incentive to encour-
age inclusion of smoking in films and music videos, but it seems
likely that legal restraints on funding at least in part explain the
much lower levels of tobacco than alcohol content.
Alcohol promotion in the UK is regulated only by ASA, the
Portman Group and alcohol industry voluntary codes of prac-
tice, and as we have reported previously many alcohol compan-
ies have overt associations with artists who in turn feature their
products in music videos.9 Such paid-for content directly con-
travenes several of these codes of practice such as associating
alcohol with rites of passage into adulthood and drinking to
excess.15 22 23 The lower levels of tobacco exposure we found
indicate that similar controls on alcohol promotion could signifi-
cantly reduce exposure of children through this medium, but
would not completely remove it.
One relevant limitation of this research is that we have
selected our sample of videos from the top UK music chart,
which are not necessarily the most watched music videos on
YouTube. However, we argue that a British audience is most
likely to watch the videos associated with the most popular
chart songs. Our survey of adults was carried out later than
that of adolescents, which may have reduced the disparity
between adult and adolescent exposure, because adults had

The videos have been available for 7.1 and 10.6 months on average for adolescents and adults, respectively. Total gross impressions are based on the total number of intervals
containing any alcohol content (233) and the number of intervals containing any tobacco content (47). Adolescents refer to the population aged between 11 and 18 years, while adults
refer to the population aged 19 years or over.

 more time in which to watch the videos. Conversely, we also
acknowledge that the time differences could have influenced
the adult results because of recall bias resulting in adult respon-
dents forgetting if they had seen a video or not. Our 10 s inter-
val monitoring is semiquantitative, and affords similar weight
to any appearance within the 10 s interval, however long in
duration. While there is currently no accepted means of coding
the plethora of imagery that can occur in this medium, a more
quantitative approach is an urgent developmental priority.
Coverage bias is a problem for most survey methods including
online. W
e used YouGov because its members’ panel has a suffi-
cient
coverage
drawn
from
lower
prevalence
groups
and
because it uses purposive sampling.24 Further, the survey data
were weighted on key demographics. Online surveys have over-
taken
telephone
surveys
with
similar
response
rates
to
face-to-face interviewing and provide social distance which
reduces respondent reluctance to reveal sensitive information
(in this case adolescent smoking and drinking behaviour) and
YouGov scans all responses for inattentiveness (eg, straight line
ticking).24
Music videos are almost unregulated for their content.
While films are age classified in most countries, and television
content is subject to controls on what is broadcast during
periods when children are likely to be watching, music videos
are subject to none of these restraints. The British Board of
Film Classification has consulted on introducing an age-rating
system for music videos made in the UK, but this is a global
problem and at present only includes drug misuse, dangerous
behaviour presented as safe, bad language, sexual behaviour
and nudity, and threatening behaviour and violence. Owing to
the obvious health implications for adolescents, we suggest that
overly positive portrayals of both alcohol and tobacco in music
videos should be included in both the drug misuse and danger-
ous behaviour presented as safe rating categories. One means
of reducing impact at the national level would be to require
antismoking/alcohol
messages to
be
broadcast
immediately
before any video containing smoking or alcohol, or to apply
the practice on tobacco in Indian cinema of publishing health
warnings in subtitles over the video. However, a more effective
alternative may be to cut out this content at source, through
negotiation with the video makers and publishers. Disney films
has now announced that it will no longer make films including
smoking.25 W
e need a similar degree of social responsibility
across the tobacco, alcohol and music industries. It is well
established that young people exposed to depictions of tobacco
and alcohol content in films are more likely to start smoking
or to consume alcohol;1–8 therefore, future research should
focus on exploring the behavioural effects of exposure to
similar content in music videos through large-scale longitudinal
studies.
What is already known on this subject
▸ Adolescent exposure to alcohol and tobacco in the media
are determinants of subsequent alcohol and tobacco use.
▸ The extent of potential exposure has been transformed over
the past decade by the emergence of social media, in which
exposure to protobacco content has also been linked to
favourable attitudes towards tobacco, including intention to
smoke, in young non-smokers.
What this study adds
▸ This is the first study to provide a British population estimate
of adult and adolescent exposure to alcohol and tobacco
content in digital music videos.
▸ Our findings provide new evidence that significant numbers
of British adolescents are being exposed to both visual and
lyrical tobacco and alcohol content in popular online digital
music videos.
▸ Per capita exposure rates are much higher in adolescents
than in adults and higher in girls than in boys.
▸ Alcohol and tobacco content in music videos is therefore a
significant health hazard that requires appropriate regulatory
control.
