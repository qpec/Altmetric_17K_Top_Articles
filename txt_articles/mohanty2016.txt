Abstract 
Introduction: Few studies have reported focal impulse and rotor modulation (FIRM)-guided 
ablation to be superior to PV isolation (PVAI) in persistent (PeAF) and long-standing persistent 
atrial fibrillation (LSPAF) patients, but none of these trials were randomized.  
Objectives: We compared the efficacy of FIRM ablation with or without PVAI vs PVAI plus 
non-PV trigger ablation in PeAF and LSPAF patients. 
Methods: Non-paroxysmal AF patients undergoing first ablation were randomized (1:1:1) to 
FIRM only (group 1), FIRM+ PVAI (group 2) or PVAI+ posterior wall (PW) +non-PV trigger 
ablation (group 3). Freedom from atrial tachycardia (AT)/AF was the primary endpoint. 
Secondary endpoint included acute procedural success, defined as AF termination or ≥10% 
slowing or organization into AT.   
Results: Total of 113 patients were enrolled at 3 centers; 29 in group 1 and 42 in group 2 and 3 
each. Enrollment in group 1 was terminated early for futility. 
Focal drivers or rotors were detected in all group 1 and 2 patients with a mean of 4±1.2 and 4.2± 
1.7 per patient in respective groups. Procedure time was 222±49, 233± 48 and 131± 51 minutes 
in groups 1, 2 and 3 (p<0.001); it was significantly shorter in group 3 compared to groups 1 and 
2 (p<0.001). 
In group 1 and 2, acute success after rotor only ablation was achieved in 12 (41%) and 11 (26%) 
patients respectively.  After 12±7 month follow-up, 4 (14%), 22 (52.4%) and 32 (76%) patients 
in groups 1, 2 and 3 were AF/AT-free off anti-arrhythmic drugs (log-rank p<0.0001). Group 3 
patients experienced higher success compared to group 1 (p<0.001) and group 2(p= 0.02).  
Conclusion: This is the first randomized study that compared three ablation strategies in non-
paroxysmal AF patients and reported a very poor outcome with rotor-only ablation. Moreover, 
PVAI plus rotor ablation had significantly longer procedure time and lower efficacy than PVAI + 
PW + non-PV trigger-ablation.

Introduction 
The low efficacy of medical therapy in maintaining sinus rhythm along with the plethora 
of side-effects of those drugs have prompted the search for new techniques and technologies to 
optimize the catheter ablation procedure for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) (1). 
Pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI) is still the cornerstone for AF ablation in paroxysmal 
AF patients with reported success rate as high as 80% (2). However in persistent (PeAF) and 
long-standing persistent AF (LSPAF), the success rate is much lower even with repeat 
procedures (3). The main reason behind this poor outcome is the lack of information on the 
optimal ablation technique and the best targets to achieve freedom from arrhythmia (4). The 
PeAF and LSPAF are chronic state of the disease with progressive atrial fibrosis and evolving 
pulmonary and non-pulmonary vein (non-PV) triggers (2). It is still unclear whether substrate 
ablation alone or the elimination of triggers of AF or a combination of both, is the ideal ablation 
approach in this subset of AF population (4). The uncertainty has been compounded by the 
findings from the recently completed STAR-AF II trial which failed to observe any reduction in 
the rate of recurrent AF when additional linear ablation or ablation of complex fractionated 
electrograms (CFAEs) were performed along with PVI in PeAF patients (5). Of the many newly 
emerging approaches to modify AF-sustaining substrate, one promising strategy is the FIRM-
guided ablation that targets electrical rotors and focal sources that are believed to be responsible 
for perpetuation of AF (6). If rotors/ focal sources are mechanisms that sustain AF, then it stands 
to reason that the ablation of these rotors should be associated with improved clinical outcomes 
(7). Some trials have reported improved success rate with rotor ablation alone or in combination 
with PVAI versus PVAI alone, but the results could be biased as none of these studies were 
randomized (7-9). Therefore, we designed this prospective study, OASIS, to compare the

efficacy of FIRM ablation with or without PVAI vs PVAI plus non-PV trigger ablation in PeAF 
and LSPAF patients. 
Methods 
Trial Design 
Outcome of Different Ablation Strategies In Persistent and Long-Standing Persistent 
Atrial Fibrillation (OASIS) was a non-blinded randomized trial comparing effectiveness of three 
ablation approaches for the treatment of AF. Consenting eligible subjects were randomly 
assigned (1:1:1) to undergo FIRM guided ablation (group 1), FIRM+ PVAI ablation (group 2) or 
ablation with PVAI, PW, and non-PV triggers (Group 3) (Figure 1). The study protocol was 
approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the respective institutions. The trial was 
conducted in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki. The trial was registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02533843).  
Study Population 
All patients presenting at the 3 participating centers (Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute, 
Austin, Texas, USA; Lexington Cardiology at Central Baptist, Lexington, KY, USA and 
Cardiovascular Center Bad Neustadt, Germany) with non-paroxysmal AF undergoing catheter 
ablation were screened. Patients were included in the study if they were ≥18 years of age, have 
persistent or long-standing persistent AF, undergoing first ablation procedure, and willing to 
provide written informed consent. Exclusion criteria included reversible causes of atrial 
arrhythmia (such as hyperthyroidism, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, sarcoidosis and 
excessive alcohol consumption), prior ablation procedures and pregnancy.

A central computerized randomization scheme was generated using block randomization, and 
sets of randomly selected blocks were provided to the investigating sites. To maintain allocation 
concealment, the site administrators were instructed not to reveal the arm assignment until the 
subject’s eligibility is verified and is ready to be randomized.  
Endpoint: 
Single procedure freedom from any recurrent AF/atrial flutter (AFL)/atrial tachycardia (AT) off 
AADs was the primary endpoint. Recurrence was defined as atrial arrhythmia (AF, AFL or AT) 
of > 30 second duration off antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) at follow-up. Any episodes that 
occurred during the first 60 days (blanking period) after the procedure were not considered as 
recurrence. Secondary endpoints included acute procedural success and peri-procedural 
complications. Acute procedural success was defined as AF termination or ≥10% slowing or 
organization into AT. 
Definitions 
Electrical rotors: Sustained clockwise or counter clockwise activation around a core (6, 8). 
Focal impulses: Centrifugal activation from an origin (8). 
Non-PV triggers: Ectopic triggers originating from sites other than pulmonary veins such as 
interatrial septum, superior vena cava, left atrial appendage (LAA), crista terminalis and 
coronary sinus (CS). Both sustained (>30 seconds) as well as non-sustained triggers including 
repetitive short- lasting bursts of arrhythmia (<30 sec) or premature atrial contractions (PAC) 
(≥10 beats/minute) with earliest activation from non-PV sites were targeted for ablation (10). 
Acute procedural success: AF termination or ≥10% slowing or organization into atrial 
tachycardia (AT) (Online Figure 1 A-D)

Our mapping and ablation procedures have been described in detail in our earlier 
publications (6,11,12). Briefly, anti-arrhythmic drugs (AAD), excepting amiodarone, were 
discontinued 3-5 days before the procedure; amiodarone was stopped at least 4-6 months prior to 
the ablation. All patients underwent ablation under general anesthesia and uninterrupted anti-
coagulation with warfarin or novel oral anti-coagulants (NOACs). PVAI was always preceded by 
rotor ablation in group 2. 
FIRM-mapping (6, 8, 12) 
Ablation commenced with FIRM mapping in group 1 and 2 patients. A 3-dimensional 
map of the atria was constructed using an electroanatomic mapping system (CARTO, Biosense 
Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA or EnSite NavX, St.Jude Medical, St.Paul, MN, USA) before 
advancing the 64-pole basket mapping catheter (FIRMap, Abbott, Chicago, IL) in the right 
atrium first and left atrium next (). FIRM mapping was performed during AF. Unipolar 
electrograms were recorded for 1 minute and exported to a dedicated proprietary mapping 
system (RhythmView, Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA). RF energy was delivered with a 3.5-mm 
irrigated-tip ablation catheter with the acute endpoint of AF source elimination as confirmed 
with FIRM remapping. Rotors and focal impulses were considered AF sources only if they lay in 
reproducible spatial regions with source precision. If AF persisted despite elimination of all 
rotors or converted into AT, the patient was cardioverted. 
PVAI, posterior wall (PW) and non-PV trigger ablation (11, 12) 
PVAI and electrical isolation of the left atrial posterior wall were performed using 3.5-
mm irrigated-tip catheter guided by circular mapping catheter, intra-cardiac echocardiography 
(ICE) and a 3-D mapping system. Radiofrequency (RF) energy was delivered with a maximum 
temperature setting of 420C and a power of up to 45W. An esophageal probe was utilized in all 
 MANUSCRIPT

7 
patients to monitor esophageal luminal temperature during ablation in areas in close proximity to 
the esophagus, such as the left atrial posterior wall. When ablating the posterior wall, the power 
was decreased to 35W. Complete abolition of all PV potentials rather than decrease in the 
amplitudes was the end point and confirmed by entrance block. If ablation was unsuccessful in 
terminating the arrhythmia, cardioversion was performed to restore sinus rhythm. 
After stable sinus rhythm was achieved either during ablation or after cardioversion, 
isoproterenol 20- 30µg/min for 15–20min was given to disclose any non-PV triggers and to look 
for acute pulmonary vein reconnection. Mapping was done using the circular mapping catheter 
during isoproterenol challenge to identify the site of origin of significant ectopic activity by 
comparing the activation sequence of the sinus beat with that of the ectopic beat. Additional RF 
energy was used to ablate the non-PV foci, both sustained and non-sustained. Patients were 
discharged after an overnight stay on their previously ineffective AADs, with the exception of 
amiodarone, which was never restarted during the 2-month blanking period. 
Follow-up 
Follow-up was performed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months with office visits, cardiology 
evaluation, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and 7 day holter monitoring at 3, 6 and 12 months. 
Additionally, patients were given event-recorders for the first 5 months following the procedure 
and were asked to transmit their rhythm every time they had symptoms compatible with 
arrhythmias and at least 3 times a week even if asymptomatic. 
Oral anticoagulant therapy was continued up to 6 months following the procedure, after 
which it was discontinued in all patients that remained arrhythmia-free. If the patients underwent 
LAA isolation, a TEE was performed at 6 months to assess the contractility and flow velocity of 
the LAA and in case of inadequate flow-velocity, patients were kept on anticoagulants (13).

Sample Size 
In the absence of historical data on FIRM-guided ablation procedure in non-paroxysmal 
population, we were not able to perform a formal power analysis. Instead, we planned to 
continue approaching consecutive patients until we have enrolled 42 patients in each group. The 
justification for this sample size was based on feasibility of enrolling enough participants within 
a reasonable time frame. 
A relatively high recurrence among the FIRM only subjects (group 1) triggered an 
unplanned interim assessment by the internal safety committee. The committee recommended 
terminating the arm for futility, and continuing with the planned enrollment for other two groups. 
Statistical analysis 
The primary analysis was conducted for the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which 
consisted of all randomized patients undergoing ablation procedure. Primary endpoint was tested 
using survival analysis method, and the null hypothesis was tested using log-rank test, multiple-
comparison adjustment of survival curves was performed using Tukey-Kramer method. Subjects 
who were recurrence-free at the end of follow-up were censored.AF-free time was defined as 
time from procedure date to censor date. Survival curves were constructed using Kaplan-Meier 
method. Unadjusted and multivariable adjusted Cox regression models were used for assessing 
independent predictors of AF-free survival. Sex and AF type were entered into the model as 
covariates Incidence of procedural complications was compared between cohorts using Fisher’s 
exact test. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics were reported using descriptive 
statistics. Continuous data are described as mean ± standard deviation  and as counts and percent 
if categorical. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests were used to compare groups. 
Tukey-Kramer method was used for ANOVA post-hoc pairwise comparison. Procedure time and

Results 
Study Population 
A total of 378 patients were screened during the study period and 113 were enrolled at 
the 3 centers; 29 in group 1 and 42 in group 2 and 3 each. Enrollment in group 1 was terminated 
early for futility after enrollment of the 29 patients. Study design and patient disposition is 
presented in a flow diagram (Figure 1). Groups were well balanced on baseline and clinical 
characteristics (Table 1). In summary, LSPAF 31%, 29%, 31%; LA diameter 4.73±0.75, 
4.84±0.74, 4.67±0.69; LVEF 54±10, 55.4±9.9, 55±10 in group 1, 2 and 3 respectively.  
Electrical Rotors 
Focal drivers or rotors were detected in all group 1 and 2 patients with a mean of 4.0±1.2 
and 4.2± 1.7 rotors per patient in respective groups (p=0.55). A total of 116 AF rotors (61% LA 
and 39 % RA) and 117 (68% LA and 33% RA) lying in widespread locations were detected in 
groups 1 and 2 respectively. Distribution of AF rotors in the two groups is summarized in Table 
2 and Figure 2.  
Non-PV triggers 
During the isoproterenol challenge non-PV triggers were detected in all patients in group 
3. The foci were most commonly mapped to the coronary sinus (73.8%), left atrial appendage 
(38.1%), LA septum (50.0%), superior vena cava (28.6%), and mitral valve annulus (4.8%). The 
sources were ablated.

Procedure time was 222±49, 233± 48 and 131± 51 minutes in groups 1, 2 and 3 
(p<0.001); it was significantly shorter in group 3 compared to groups 1 and 2 (p<0.001). 
Compared to group 2, group 3 patients had significantly longer radiofrequency time (42.3 ±14.1 
and 54.1 ±21.4 minutes respectively, p=0.003). Procedural parameters are summarized in Table 
2. After rotor ablation, acute success was achieved in 12 (41%) and 11 (26%) in group 1 and 2 
respectively.  
Freedom from Arrhythmia Recurrence 
After 12±7 month follow-up, 4 of 29 (14%) in group 1, 22 (52.4%) in group 2 and 32 
(76%) patients in group 3 were AF/AT-free without AADs (log-rank p<0.0001). Patients in 
group 3 experienced significantly higher success compared to group 1 (p<0.001) and group 2 
(p=0.02) (log-rank p adjusted for multiple pair-wise testing). Sensitivity analysis of primary 
endpoint was performed after stratifying by AF type. In persistent AF patients the success rate 
was 53% (16/30) and 72% (21/29) in group 2 and 3 respectively (log-rank p=0.13). In the LSP 
AF cohort, 6 of 12 (50.0%) patients in group 2 and 11 of 13 (84.6%) in group 3 were recurrence 
free (log-rank p=0.06). 
Predictor of Recurrence 
We assessed the prognostic role of the ablation approach by fitting a Cox model. Group 1 
was excluded from this analysis. These findings revealed that compared to group 3 (PVAI, PW, 
and non-PV trigger ablation), group 2 (FIRM+ PVAI ablation) was associated with significantly 
higher risk of recurrence. Unadjusted hazard ratio was 2.37 (95% CI 1.1 to 5.07), p=0.025. After 
adjusting for sex and AF type the in multivariable model the hazard ratio was 2.36 (95% CI 1.11 
to 5.09), p=0.027.

No procedure-related adverse events occurred in any of the patients in group 1. Two 
patients (1 in group 2 and 1 in group 3) had minor groin hematoma and 1 patient in group 2 had a 
small pericardial effusion that was conservatively managed with fresh-frozen plasma and 
protamine. No major adverse events such as stroke, pulmonary stenosis, esophageal injury or 
major bleeding events were reported. 
Discussion 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomized trial that compared the efficacy 
of FIRM ablation with or without PVAI vs PVAI plus posterior wall plus non-PV trigger 
ablation in PeAF and LSPAF patients. Our main findings were the following; 1) Acute 
procedural success after targeting the FIRM-identified rotors was achieved in a small number of 
patients; 41% and 26% in group 1 and 2 respectively, 2) Rotor-only ablation had very poor 
outcome in terms of arrhythmia recurrence for which that arm was terminated prematurely and 3) 
PVAI plus rotor ablation had significantly longer procedure time and lower efficacy than PVAI + 
PW + non-PV trigger-ablation. 
We observed a significantly longer procedure time with rotor ablation with or without 
PVAI in our study population which was in agreement with some earlier trials (7, 14) and in 
disparity with others (15). This discrepancy can be due to detection of more rotors than that 
reported by the CONFIRM study (mean of 4 vs 2 per patient) that most likely made the 
procedure time longer (15). 
Despite lengthier procedure time, we failed to accomplish the high acute success with 
rotor ablation as reported by earlier studies (15-17); one possible explanation for which is the 
difference in the study population. In all of the abovementioned trials, the population was 
comprised of subjects with paroxysmal and persistent AF whereas our study included only non-

paroxysmal AF (PeAF and LSPAF) patients and it is well known that acute termination is not an 
easy task to accomplish in this subset of AF population (18). In accordance with our finding, two 
recently published single-center experiences, have reported similarly low acute procedural 
success in non-paroxysmal population (7, 19). Other feasible reasons might be the small sample 
size, non-randomized study design with possible bias in patient selection and the learning-curve 
effect (6).  
In our study, acute success was achieved in higher number of patients in group 1 
compared to group 2. However, no conclusions can be drawn from this observation as the groups 
were unbalanced in terms of number of patients included in the analysis. At 12±7 month follow-
up, only 14% of our patients that underwent rotor-only ablation (group 1) remained arrhythmia-
free off-AAD. Because of this poor outcome, this arm was deemed futile and discontinued 
prematurely to avoid exposing the patients to inappropriate risks. Our success rate was 
surprisingly lower compared to the reported results by Miller et al (71.4%) and the CONFIRM 
trial (70.6%), which can be again due to the difference in the selected population (9, 15). It is 
also possible that ablation limited to only rotors is not sufficient to maintain sinus rhythm in non-
paroxysmal AF and additional ablations are required. This was evidenced by the procedure 
outcome in group 2 and 3 of our study patients, where additional ablations led to a better success 
rate compared to group 1; after 12±7 month follow-up, the single-procedure success rate off-
AAD was 4 (14%), 22 (52.4%) and 32 (76%) in groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively (p<0.0001). 
Although the arrhythmia-free survival following PVAI + rotor ablation (group 2) in our 
population was lower than that of previous studies (Miller et al: 80.5% and CONFIRM: 82.4%), 
it was comparable with the findings of Tomassoni et al (single procedure off-AAD success rate 
58% in PeAF and 25% in LSPAF) (9, 15, 19).

Our results demonstrated the extensive approach of PVAI + left atrial posterior wall 
(LAPW) + ablation of non-PV triggers to be the most effective ablation strategy in the non-
paroxysmal AF population. Several factors may have concertedly contributed to the observed 
high success rate of this ablation approach such as isolation of LAPW and ablation of non-PV 
triggers detected by isoproterenol challenge.  
The common embryologic origin of the PVs and the LAPW provides the anatomic basis 
that suggests the role of LAPW as an arrhythmogenic substrate in the origin and maintenance of 
AF and consequently isolation of the LAPW has been shown to increase the short- and mid-term 
success rate of PVAI in non-paroxysmal AF patients (20-23). With the persistence of AF, both 
the frequency and number of non-PV triggers increase and several studies have shown the 
benefits of ablation of those extra-PV foci in providing effective and durable arrhythmia-free 
survival (2, 24-27).  
We observed the best outcome with substrate ablation including non-PV triggers 
combined with PVAI in non-paroxysmal AF patients which reaffirmed the current guideline 
recommendation that patients with persistent AF undergoing catheter ablation should receive 
additional substrate ablation to improve outcome (28). However, in the recently published STAR 
AF II trial, no reduction in recurrence was observed with additional substrate ablation such as 
linear ablations or ablation of complex fractionated electrograms (CFAEs) (5). The discrepancy 
can be best explained by quoting the STAR AF II investigators, “Perhaps neither complex 
electrograms nor lines are the correct supplemental targets for ablation”.  Several earlier 
randomized trials have reported no additional advantages of linear ablation approach over PVI 
alone in AF/AT patients although the lines required significantly more ablation time, radiation 
dose and longer procedure duration (29-31). Similarly, CFAE ablation has been reported to

confer no long-term incremental benefit when performed in addition to PV antral isolation (32, 
33). 
Last but not the least; although more extensive ablation was performed in group 3, it took 
less procedure and fluoroscopic time than the other two strategies while offering comparable 
safety and better efficacy. 
Limitations 
We acknowledge few limitations in this trial; 1) AF recurrence could have been 
underestimated as the patients were not constantly monitored and we could have also missed 
some asymptomatic events. However, patients included in this study were symptomatic and were 
able to distinguish their AF symptoms. Also, in an earlier study conducted by our group, we did 
not observe significant differences in the captured arrhythmia events between the implantable 
loop recorder and conventional monitoring (34), 2) a lengthier follow-up would have provided a 
better comparison of the long-term outcome of PVAI +rotors ablation versus PVAI + LAPW 
+non-PV triggers ablation, but historically, the success rate of the latter ablation approach has 
been similar after ≥2 years follow-up (27), 3) the relatively small sample size. However, we 
could still detect a true effect that was statistically significant. 
Conclusion 
This is the first randomized study that compared three ablation strategies in non-
paroxysmal AF patients and reported a very poor outcome with rotor-only ablation. Furthermore, 
acute procedural success was achieved in very few after the ablation of rotors. Additionally, rotor 
ablation combined with pulmonary vein isolation had significantly longer procedure time and 
lower efficacy than the ablation strategy including isolation of left atrial posterior wall and non-
