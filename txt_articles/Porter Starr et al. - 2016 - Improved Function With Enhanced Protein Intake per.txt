Abstract
Background: Obesity is a significant cause of functional limitations in older adults; yet, concerns that weight reduction could diminish muscle 
along with fat mass have impeded progress toward an intervention. Meal-based enhancement of protein intake could protect function and/or 
lean mass but has not been studied during geriatric obesity reduction.
Methods: In this 6-month randomized controlled trial, 67 obese (body mass index ≥30 
kg/m2) older (≥60 years) adults with a Short Physical 
Performance Battery score of 4–10 were randomly assigned to a traditional (Control) weight loss regimen or one with higher protein intake 
(>30 
g) at each meal (Protein). All participants were prescribed a hypo-caloric diet, and weighed and provided dietary guidance weekly. Physical 
function (Short Physical Performance Battery) and lean mass (BOD POD), along with secondary measures, were assessed at 0, 3, and 6 months.
Results: At the 6-month endpoint, there was significant (p < .001) weight loss in both the Control (−7.5 
± 
6.2 
kg) and Protein (−8.7 
± 
7.4 
kg) 
groups. Both groups also improved function but the increase in the Protein (+2.4 
± 
1.7 units; p < .001) was greater than in the Control 
(+0.9 
± 
1.7 units; p < .01) group (p = .02).
Conclusion: Obese, functionally limited older adults undergoing a 6-month weight loss intervention with a meal-based enhancement of protein 
quantity and quality lost similar amounts of weight but had greater functional improvements relative to the Control group. If confirmed, this 
dietary approach could have important implications for improving the functional status of this vulnerable population (ClinicalTrials.gov 
identifier: NCT01715753).
Keywords: Obesity—Function—Frailty—Older adults—Weight loss intervention—Protein
The obesity epidemic is progressively threatening the health of 
many older adults (1); already, 35% or more of those older than 
60 years are obese (body mass index ≥30 
kg/m2) and this prevalence 
is expected to increase (2). While obesity is well known to inten-
sify age-related chronic health conditions like cardiovascular disease 
and type 2 diabetes, its impact on function is even more pervasive. 
Essentially all older adults who are obese have diminished mobil-
ity, independence, and performance of activities of daily living (3,4). 
Excess adiposity, physical inactivity, and loss of muscle strength and 
mass are mutually and dramatically reinforcing, especially in combi-
nation with aging (4). Concerns are building that, in the near future, 
the functionally disabled, obese older adult may become the most 
commonly encountered phenotype of frailty (5).
Because of concerns about detrimental effects on muscle (6), bone 
(7), and/or mortality (8), weight loss has not been recommended for 
obese older adults. However, obesity reduction can provide remark-
able benefits to inflammatory status, metabolic profiles, physi-
cal function, and quality of life in this population (1,9,10). Most

 geriatric obesity reduction trials to date have employed a diet plus 
exercise combination, as exercise drives muscle anabolism and can 
help preserve lean mass (LM) during weight loss (11,12). However, a 
subset of obese older adults are limited by excess weight and reduced 
muscle strength, making vigorous exercise an impractical option and 
limiting generalizability of previous findings to a frail, obese popula-
tion (13,14). For those individuals with limited ability to exercise, 
there is an intriguing possibility that enhanced protein intake alone 
can be used to promote muscle protein synthesis and, thus, reten-
tion of LM, during obesity reduction. While the anabolic response to 
dietary protein is blunted by aging (14), enhancing the diet to include 
approximately 30 
g of high-quality protein per meal can enable older 
adults to reach a level of muscle protein synthesis equal to that of 
younger individuals (15–17). There is a growing consensus based 
upon these short-term studies that this level of protein per meal be 
recommended for older adults at risk for sarcopenia (17–20). This 
would represent a major shift in protein intake patterns, because the 
majority of adults skew their meal intake so that most of the protein 
for the day is consumed at the evening meal (17).
Whether per meal enhancement of protein intake can offset the 
lack of exercise and protect muscle mass and function during weight 
loss in frail but obese older adults is essentially unknown. In the only 
investigation to date, Coker and colleagues (13) compared a con-
ventional meal replacement to one with whey protein and essential 
amino acids in a short-term (8 week) study. They found no group 
difference in LM preservation; however, the supplemented group had 
increased rates of muscle protein synthesis and preferential loss of 
adipose tissue. Based on this and the acute studies of protein synthesis 
thresholds for older adults (15,16), we developed the MEASUR-UP 
(Measuring Eating, Activity and Strength: Understanding the 
Response-Using Protein) trial, which is the first to examine meal-
based enhancement of protein intake (30 
g high-quality protein per 
each of 3 meals) during a long-term (6 month) weight loss interven-
tion (10% weight reduction goal) in obese older adults with func-
tional limitations. Because animal proteins, complete in all essential 
amino acids, are superior for promoting anabolism (21) and consid-
ering the protein sources used in the short-term studies of protein 
enhancement (Symons et al. (15)—beef; Pennings et al. (16)—whey), 
the 30 
g of protein was provided from animal sources, primarily lean 
beef, and from other lean meats, low fat dairy, fish, and eggs. We 
hypothesized that participants following the enhanced protein regi-
men would (i) have greater improvements in functional status and (ii) 
have better preservation of LM than Control participants.
Methods
Trial Design and Randomization
MEASUR-UP is a two-armed randomized, controlled pilot trial, with 
primary and secondary outcomes assessed at 0, 3, and 6 months; 
the design and detailed methods were previously published (22). 
Blocking by gender and marital and partner status, eligible partici-
pants were randomly assigned to a traditional weight loss (Control) 
or a protein-enhanced weight loss (Protein) study arm in a 1:2 allo-
cation ratio using a computerized randomization scheme. Primary 
outcomes were function (Short Physical Performance Battery; SPPB) 
(23) and LM (BOD POD). Secondary outcomes included anthro-
pometrics, physical activity, and hand grip strength. Protein and 
calorie (kcal) intakes were assessed as indicators of feasibility and 
compliance. The study was approved by the Duke University Health 
System Institutional Review Board and written informed consent 
was obtained from all participants (Figure 1).
Participants
Obese (body mass index ≥30 
kg/m2), functionally impaired (SPPB 
score of 4–10 out of 12), men and women living in communities 
near Durham, North Carolina, were recruited. The enrollment age of 
≥60 years is a commonly used criteria for studies of older adults and 
was chosen because age-associated disabilities often appear earlier 
in individuals who are overweight and obese. All participants with a 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of ≥60 
mL/min/1.73 m2 were study 
eligible; those with a GFR of 45 to 59 
mL/min/1.73 m2 were enrolled 
but a GFR was repeated every 2 months. Exclusion criteria included 
GFR <45 
mL/min/1.73 m2, dementia, neurological conditions causing 
functional limitations, and unstable or terminal medical conditions.
Interventions
All participants received a supervised weight loss treatment (hypo-
caloric diet with goal of 10% weight loss over 6 months) delivered 
by Registered Dietitians (Interventionists). Interventionists provided 
individualized kcal prescriptions and meal plans, led weekly group 
meetings for counseling and peer support, and supervised weekly 
weigh-ins. A daily low dose multivitamin (Teen Multivitamin for Boys 
12–17, GNC Milestones), along with calcium (400 
mg) and vitamin D 
(600 IU) (Citracal, Bayer), were provided to participants in both arms; 
other dietary supplements were prohibited during the trial. Adherence 
was assessed by 3-day food records and food journals (turned in at 
weekly group meetings), weight loss, and weekly attendance at group 
meetings. There was no prescribed exercise intervention; however, 
participants were encouraged to be as active as they safely could.
Diets
Control participants were prescribed a 500 kcal deficit diet (15% 
protein, 30% fat, 55% carbohydrate); prescribed protein intake met 
the Recommended Dietary Allowance (0.8 
g/kg body weight). Protein 
participants were also prescribed a 500 kcal deficit but with a macro-
nutrient distribution of 30% protein, 30% fat, 40% carbohydrate; 
prescribed protein intake was 1.2 
g/kg. Protein meal plans included 
30+ grams of lean, high-quality protein three times a day, with no 
adjustment for changes in body weight over time. To ease the eco-
nomic and logistical burden, Protein participants were supplied with 
≥420 
g protein per week (at least 60 
g per day, enough for two meals 
for each of the 7 days); it was provided in the form of cooked, then 
chilled or frozen, very lean beef (ground sirloin, deli roast beef, and 
flank steak), along with instructions for preparation. The prepor-
tioned lean beef was packed in insulated thermal bags and distributed 
at weekly group meetings. Other complete proteins (eg, other lean 
meats and poultry, low fat dairy foods and eggs) were consumed at 
the remaining meal (participant’s choice). This was to avoid monot-
ony and to allow flexibility (eg, special occasions). Interventionists 
reviewed participants’ daily food journals each week and adjusted 
their menus to ensure the target of 30 
g protein per meal for break-
fast, lunch, and dinner was met, as previously described (22). Weekly 
body weights provided an additional indication of diet compliance.
Outcome Measurements
Physical function was measured using the SPPB (23), which has 
three component domains (balance, lower-body strength, and gait 
speed), yielding a total score of 0 (poor) to 12 (high). LM and fat 
mass were measured using BOD POD air displacement plethysmog-
raphy (Life Measurement Inc, Concord, CA); the BOD POD was 
calibrated daily using the precision 49.367-L cylinder provided by 
the instrument manufacturer and measurement conditions (fasting

 state, clothing) were carefully standardized. Waist circumference 
(minimal waist, Gulick II tape measure) was also assessed. Isometric 
grip strength was assessed (both hands, Jamar Hand Dynamometer), 
with the higher of two successive scores for the dominant hand being 
recorded. Duration of moderate–intensity activities was assessed 
using the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors 
(CHAMPS) questionnaire (24).
For diet compliance, 3-day food records were collected at 0, 
3, and 6 months and analyzed (Food Processor Nutrition Analysis 
Software; ESHA Research, Salem, OR) for daily intakes of kcals and 
protein, and protein and meal. Most study outcomes were objec-
tively measured (eg, BOD POD output, distance walked in 6 min-
utes, self-administered questionnaires, etc.), and data management 
and analysis were performed by research staff fully blinded to treat-
ment assignment. For the few potentially subjective measures, for 
example, coding of food choices from food records, the analysis was 
performed by staff blinded to treatments.
Safety
Adverse events were monitored throughout the trial. Renal function 
(GFR; LabCorp, Inc) was assessed at baseline, every other month for 
those with a baseline GFR of 45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and at the 
6-month endpoint.
Data Management and Analysis
The MEASUR-UP trial evaluated the efficacy of meal-based enhance-
ment of protein during weight loss by comparing the Protein treat-
ment to the Control. The design included an interim measurement 
point (3 months) to provide a more precise assessment of the func-
tional form of the compliance by change in the two primary out-
comes of function (SPPB) and lean body mass. The study analysis 
was performed under an “intent to treat” criteria, including all par-
ticipants, whether compliant to the intervention or not. Data were 
double entered with differences adjudicated. Treatment codes were 
revealed only after locking of the database at trial’s end.
We tested primary and secondary variables with regards to over-
all change within arms and differences in change between arms over 
time. A Mixed Models repeated measures approach was used to 
assess change from baseline at two time points (3 and 6 months), con-
trolling for baseline values. The main effect of the primary outcomes 
was tested by the time effect, while the group difference was assessed 
by statistical significance of the Group and the Group × Time interac-
tion. Statistical significance was declared at level alpha of 0.05 (two-
tailed). Meal enhancement of protein intake has not been previously 
studied during weight reduction in obese older adults with regards to 
our study outcomes, thus a priori power calculations were not pos-
sible. However, we carried out a post hoc power analysis using the 
derived parameters from the current trial to determine the necessary 
sample size. For SSPB and LM, setting alpha to 0.05 (two-tailed), 
power to 80% and assuming our means and variances are replicated, 
we calculated a requirement of n = 48 and n = 336 analyzable partici-
pants for SPPB and LM, respectively. These calculations are based on 
LM measurements using the BOD POD; if, as, some studies suggest 
(25), measurements made with BOD POD have higher variability 
than those made with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, our post 
hoc power numbers may overestimate the required pool size if X-ray 
absorptiometry was used for LM assessment.
Results
Study Population and Retention
Of 93 eligible individuals, 26 were excluded at screening (see 
Consort diagram in Supplementary Material). Baseline character-
istics for the 67 participants enrolled (Control, n = 26 and Protein, 
n = 41) are shown in Table 1. Due to time constraints that limited 
the trial duration, we randomized 11 participants to complete a 3

 rather than a 6-month intervention (4 to Protein, 7 to Control). 
Two of those randomized to Protein and four of the Control par-
ticipants, respectively, completed the 3 months and were assessed 
for all outcomes.
The study population was largely female (79.1%) and white 
(70.1%), with Class II obesity (mean body mass index = 37.1 kg/
m2). Dropout rates are shown in the consort diagram 
(Supplementary Material); we found no group differences in drop-
out rates or in predictors of dropout. The only predictor of drop-
ping out was having a lower mean waist circumference (p < .05); it 
was 112.9 ± 12.8 cm for dropouts, compared with 120.6 ± 12.9 cm 
for study completers.
Intervention Delivery and Adherence
By the 6-month endpoint, both groups had reduced their kcal 
intakes (Table 2) and achieved significant (p < .001) amounts 
of weight loss (Control −7.5 ± 6.2 kg; Protein −8.7 ± 7.4 kg) 
(Supplementary Material). Study completers had excellent attend-
ance at weekly group and weigh-in meetings (Control = 87% ± 
11%; Protein = 85% ± 10%). Analyses of 3-day diet records (at 
3 and 6 months, compared with baseline) revealed excellent con-
gruence with the prescribed protein intakes in the Protein group 
at all three meals; at 3 and 6 months respectively, protein intakes 
were 27.7 ± 28.4 g and 27.9 ± 29.1 g for breakfast; 36.3 ± 17.6 g 
and 36.3 ± 15.9 g for lunch; and 42.9 ± 23.2 g and 37.5 ± 16.8 g for 
dinner. In the Protein group, protein intake was 1.2 
g/kg/day at 
both time points. In contrast, protein intake in the Control group 
remained at 0.8 g/kg/day at 3 and 6 months.
Primary Outcomes
As shown in Table 3, both Control and Protein groups achieved 
substantial improvements in SPPB score, controlling for baseline 
(p < .01). However, the SPPB response in the Protein group was 
greater than in the Control group, as indicated by the overall group 
effect (p = .02). While Control SPPB score increased by 0.8 
± 
1.5 
and 0.9 
± 
1.7 at 3 and 6 months (p < .01, both), the corresponding 
increases in Protein were 2.3 
± 
1.7 and 2.4 
± 
1.7 (p < .001, both). 
As is expected when body weight is reduced, LM decreased in both 
groups (Control −1.8 
± 
2.9 
kg; Protein −1.1 
± 
1.5 
kg; p < .01, both); 
there was no group difference in this change (p = .87 at 3 and p = .38 
at 6 months) (Table 3).
Secondary Outcomes
Fat mass was reduced at 3 and 6 months in Control (−4.1 
± 
4.0 
and -6.0 
± 
5.6 
kg; p < .001, p < .001) and Protein (−5.1 
± 
4.1 and 
−7.6 
± 
6.7 
kg; p < .001, p < .001) groups (Table 3), as was waist 
circumference (Control, p < .01, Protein, p < .01 at 3 months; 
6 months, Protein only, p < .001). There was no group difference 
for change in either fat mass or waist circumference. Physical activ-
ity (CHAMPS questionnaire) was unchanged at 3 months (Control, 
p = .24, Protein, p = .34) but significantly increased at 6 months 
(Control, p < .01, Protein, p < .05), with no group difference at either 
time point. Handgrip strength remained unchanged throughout the 
trial for both groups.
Safety
No adverse events related to the protocol and no serious adverse 
events occurred. One Protein participant was disqualified when his 
GFR dropped below 45 
mL/min/1.73 m2 and one Control partici-
pant who had remained qualified throughout the trial had a GFR of 
42 at 6 months. Otherwise, no clinically important changes in GFR 
occurred.
Discussion
The MEASUR-UP trial demonstrated that per meal protein enhance-
ment of a weight reduction diet is feasible, safe, and more effective 
at improving physical function in obese and frail older adults than a 
traditional weight loss diet. Although the increase in overall dietary 
protein was modest (from 0.8 to 1.2 
g/kg body weight), improve-
ments in function exceeded those seen in Controls.
New Interest in Protein-Enhanced Weight Loss 
Regimens
Recent reports on nutrition in older adults have emphasized the 
potential value of protein supplements and/or protein-centric meals 
and the importance of complete (animal source) protein for main-
taining muscle quality (26–28). An elevated anabolic threshold in 
aged muscle has also been confirmed (16). To date, three studies 
have explored protein supplementation during geriatric obesity 
reduction. Mojtahedi and colleagues (29) evaluated a whey protein 
supplement (25 g twice daily for 6 months, plus exercise) and found 
no differential effects on physical function or LM. Likewise, in a 
small (n =11), short-term (8-weeks) study using whey protein plus 
essential amino acids and no exercise intervention, Coker and col-
leagues (13) found no protein effect on LM; functional outcomes 
were not reported. In contrast to these findings, Verreijen and col-
leagues (30) compared a combination supplement (daily 20.7 g 
leucine-rich whey protein, vitamin D, other nutrients; 13 weeks) to 
an isocaloric control (with resistance training in both groups) and 
reported a protein benefit for appendicular muscle mass. This result 
could relate in part to resistance training, which is well known to 
additively enhance the effect of protein supplementation on anabo-
lism (31). However, while function improved in this trial, there was 
no group difference.
In the MEASUR-UP trial, a protein benefit was clearly demon-
strated for function, but we were unable to detect a link between

 change in function and change in LM at 3 (r = −0.23, p = .12) or 6 
(r = 0.03, = 0.86) months. This finding is in contrast to the impressive 
body of evidence supporting a benefit of higher protein intakes to LM 
retention in the general adult population (32,33) and it could be that 
the global BOD POD assessment of LM was insufficiently sensitive 
(eg, as compared with X-ray absorptiometry measurement) to detect 
group differences in LM retention at the level of the skeletal muscle 
in our frail population. This notion is consistent with our post hoc 
power calculation indicating an insufficient sample size for detecting 
a change in LM. However, it is noteworthy that among MEASUR-UP 
participants who lost 5% or more of baseline body weight, the pro-
portion of weight loss that was LM was 31.8% in the Control group 
compared with 18.4% in the Protein group. This difference might sug-
gest that the enhanced protein diet had the hypothesized protective 
effect on LM, an effect that might be significant when tested with a 
larger sample and/or a more sensitive body composition methodology.

 Strengths and Limitations
As an intensive weight reduction trial in an understudied population, 
MEASUR-UP has several strengths. Successful recruitment demon-
strated enthusiasm for weight loss interventions among the obese 
and physically frail older population and the feasibility of the weight 
loss protocol was also confirmed. The functional testing provided 
direct evidence of the meaningful benefits accrued when obesity is 
reduced. Also, the meal-based protein enhancement was feasible, as 
meal-based targets for protein and kcals were achieved. These find-
ings, along with the absence of adverse side effects, support further 
study of the functional benefits that protein-enhanced meals might 
provide during weight reduction in obese older adults.
Limitations of MEASUR-UP include its modest sample size. 
Given the pilot nature of this study, we restricted our analyses to 
two primary outcome measures and did not correct for multiple test-
ing. Additionally, the small control group and carry forward of data 
for the subjects who completed the 3-month only protocol may have 
caused artificial increases in variation. The dropout rates, while dis-
appointing, were not unexpected given the intensive nature of the 
intervention and the frail population (see Supplementary Material). 
Most dropouts occurred because of changes in personal or health 
circumstances that were unrelated to the study. The provision of beef 
protein for 2 of 3 meals per day leads to limited generalizability, 
both in terms of LM effects and with regards to community appli-
cation. However, with respect to LM, there is no prior evidence of 
a meaningful differential anabolic effect of one complete protein 
versus another. As to community applicability, our participants did 
not have trouble with adherence to the meal plans as the menus 
were simple and easy to follow. However, while the provision of beef 
products may have improved adherence, it is also possible that the 
ability to choose from a wider variety of complete protein foods 
may simplify diet delivery while maintaining the functional benefits.
Conclusions
The MEASUR-UP trial demonstrated that a weight loss diet with 
enhanced meal-based protein intake was comparable to a traditional 
diet in achieving weight loss and superior to a traditional diet in 
terms of improving function. These results raise the possibility that 
protein-enhanced meals can foster optimization of dietary protein 
efficacy during weight reduction in obese and frail older adults. 
Future trials with larger sample sizes that include outcomes of 
function and LM retention, as well as community-based studies of 
feasibility, are well justified. Meal-based protein enhancement, com-
bined with weight loss, has the potential to improve physical func-
tion in frail and obese older adults, improving their independence 
and lessening the risk of negative health outcomes in this high-risk 
population.
