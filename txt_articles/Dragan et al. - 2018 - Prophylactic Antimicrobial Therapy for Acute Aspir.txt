Background. Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy is frequently prescribed for acute aspiration pneumonitis, with the intent of 
preventing the development of aspiration pneumonia. However, few clinical studies have examined the benefits and harms of this 
practice. 
Methods. A retrospective cohort study design was used to compare outcomes of patients with aspiration pneumonitis who 
received prophylactic antimicrobial therapy with those managed with supportive care only during the initial 2 days following mac-
roaspiration. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality within 30 days. Secondary outcomes included transfer to critical care 
and antimicrobial therapy received between days 3 and 14 following macroaspiration including escalation of therapy and antibiot-
ic-free days.
Results. Among 1483 patients reviewed, 200 met the case definition for acute aspiration pneumonitis, including 76 (38%) 
who received prophylactic antimicrobial therapy and 124 (62%) who received supportive management only. After adjusting for 
patient-level predictors, antimicrobial prophylaxis was not associated with any improvement in mortality (odds ratio, 0.9; 95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 0.4–1.7; P = .7). Patients receiving prophylactic antimicrobial therapy were no less likely to require transfer to 
critical care (5% vs 6%; P = .7) and subsequently received more frequent escalation of antibiotic therapy (8% vs 1%; P = .002) and 
fewer antibiotic-free days (7.5 vs 10.9; P < .0001).
Conclusions. Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy for patients with acute aspiration pneumonitis does not offer clinical benefit 
and may generate antibiotic selective pressures that results in the need for escalation of antibiotic therapy among those who develop 
aspiration pneumonia.
Keywords. aspiration pneumonitis; antimicrobial stewardship; quality improvement.
 Aspiration pneumonitis is an acute chemical lung injury 
caused by inhalation of sterile gastric contents and can pro-
gress quickly to respiratory failure [1–3]. Supportive care is 
the mainstay of treatment for aspiration pneumonitis, with 
rapid improvement expected within 48 hours of initial insult 
[4]. One quarter of patients with macroaspiration events that 
result in pneumonitis will develop secondary bacterial pneu-
monia in the ensuing 2 to 7 days [3, 4]. Although frequently 
prescribed, prophylactic antimicrobial therapy at the time of 
a witnessed or suspected macroaspiration event has not been 
demonstrated to prevent the development of aspiration pneu-
monia or to reduce mortality [3–7].
Despite lack of evidence demonstrating benefit, a survey of 
critical care physicians suggested that 78% routinely prescribe 
antibiotics for patients at the time of confirmed macroaspira-
tion [5], and a multicenter study of critically ill patients sug-
gested that 87% of patients with a firm diagnosis of aspiration 
pneumonitis and 97% of those with suspected aspiration receive 
early antibiotics [6]. This practice exposes patients to potentially 
unnecessary antibiotics, which may contribute to the develop-
ment of antimicrobial resistance and adverse events such as 
Clostridium difficile infection [8, 9].
Since antimicrobial therapy for aspiration pneumonitis has 
not been demonstrated to prevent the subsequent develop-
ment of pneumonia and may only select for more resistant 
respiratory pathogens, we hypothesized that this practice is 
associated with the need for subsequent broader-spectrum 
antimicrobial therapy following acute aspiration pneumonitis 
events without improved clinical outcomes. The objective of 
this study was to determine the potential benefits and harms 
of antibiotics prescribed for acute aspiration pneumonitis.

prophylactic antimicrobial therapy with those managed with 
supportive care only during the initial 2 days following mac-
roaspiration. The source cohort consisted of all patients aged 
>18 years admitted to the acute care Bayview campus of 
Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 
who met the case definition for aspiration pneumonitis between 
1 January 2010 and 9 June 2016. Study approval was obtained 
from the Research Ethics Board of Sunnybrook Health Sciences 
Centre. The need for individual consent was waived.
Case Definition
Patients with acute aspiration pneumonitis were identified by 
searching the database of our hospital’s electronic patient record 
(EPR) for all chest radiographs with the word “aspiration” in 
the clinical history. Chart review was performed by 2 inde-
pendent abstractors (V. D. and Y. W.). Patients aged >18 years 
were included if they had a macroaspiration event confirmed 
by clinical documentation (eg, witnessed vomiting, choking on 
food) and a chest radiograph demonstrating a new radiologic 
infiltrate. Only patients who were non-mechanically venti-
lated and admitted to an acute care unit at the time of aspir-
ation were included. Patients already receiving antimicrobial 
therapy on the day of an aspiration event or already intubated 
prior to acute aspiration were excluded. Interrater reliability 
of reviewers was determined based on a random sample of 40 
charts (Kappa = 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6–1). Both 
reviewers were blinded to prophylactic antimicrobial exposure, 
which was extracted from a separate database and matched to 
the patient cohort following case identification and abstraction 
of clinical outcomes (Figure 1).
Prophylactic Antimicrobial Exposure
Patient antimicrobial exposures were extracted from the 
Stewardship Program Integrating Resource Information 
Technology database, which contains all hospital antimicrobial 
prescriptions at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre [10]. For 
study purposes, we defined prophylactic antimicrobial expos-
ure as receipt of any antimicrobial agent that would provide 
coverage for respiratory bacterial pathogens newly initiated 
within the acute aspiration pneumonitis time window, includ-
ing piperacillin/tazobactam, ertapenem, meropenem, ceftriax-
one, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and 
cefuroxime. This time window was defined as the initial 2 days 
following the documented macroaspiration. Patients who did 
not receive any of the aforementioned antibiotics within 2 days 
of the acute macroaspiration event were considered not to have 
received antimicrobial prophylaxis and classified as managed 
with supportive care only.
Patient Characteristics
Patient age, sex, admitting service (critical care, surgery, medi-
cine), comorbidities, validated risk factors for aspiration, peak 
serum white blood cell count, diet modification, and change in

event were extracted from the EPR. Charlson comorbidity index 
(CCI) was calculated for each patient [11]. Validated risk fac-
tors for aspiration included dysphagia, acute/subacute stroke, 
enteral feeding, seizure disorder, central nervous system disease 
including Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, space-occupy-
ing lesion, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, prior history of aspir-
ation, peritoneal dialysis or ascites, immobility due to fracture, 
and tracheostomy [3, 4, 12–14].
Study Outcomes
The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality within 30 days 
of the acute macroaspiration event. This outcome was defined 
as any death within the index hospital stay and occurring within 
30 days of admission. We elected to use this outcome rather 
than in-hospital mortality because any in-hospital death occur-
ring after 30 days would involve very prolonged hospital stays 
and may involve deaths from causes unrelated to the aspiration 
episode and subsequent development of pneumonia.
Secondary outcomes included transfer to critical care, and 
antimicrobial therapy received including escalation of ther-
apy and antibiotic-free days between days 3 and 14 following 
the acute aspiration event. This time period was specifically 
selected based on the expected development of pneumonia 
following an episode of acute aspiration pneumonitis while 
excluding the 2 initial days following the acute macroaspira-
tion event. Antibiotic-free days were defined as the number 
of days between day 3 and 14 following the index acute mac-
roaspiration event that a patient did not receive any antibiotic 
[15]. Escalation of antimicrobial therapy was defined as switch-
ing antimicrobial class to one with a higher spectrum level as 
defined by the following predetermined scale: level 1, cefuro-
xime oral formulation; level 2, levofloxacin oral formulation, 
moxifloxacin oral formulation; level 3, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin 
intravenous formulation, moxifloxacin intravenous formula-
tion; level 4, ertapenem and piperacillin/tazobactam; and level 
5, meropenem. After identifying antibiotic escalation therapy, 
cases were reviewed again to confirm the clinical indication for 
this change in antimicrobial therapy.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables of inter-
est. Continuous measures were summarized using means and 
standard deviations or median and interquartile range if they 
did not pass the test for normality. Categorical measures were 
summarized using counts and percentages.
Predictors of 30-day mortality were assessed using bivari-
ate analysis for the following variables: age, sex, admitting ser-
vice, CCI, aspiration risk factors, diet, and change in oxygen 
requirement at the time of aspiration. Odds ratios (ORs) and 
their associated 95% CIs were provided. Prior to multivariable 
modeling, the predictors of interest were assessed for multi-
collinearity (tolerance statistic <0.4). All tolerance values were 
>0.4. Predictors significantly associated with mortality (P < .05) 
were included in the multivariable logistic regression model to 
assess the impact of antimicrobial prophylaxis on the primary 
outcome. ORs, 95% CIs, and P values were reported.
Sensitivity analyses were performed on our primary and sec-
ondary outcomes: in-hospital mortality and total antimicrobial 
therapy exposure. In-hospital deaths were restricted to those 
occurring between post-aspiration day 3 and 30 to minimize 
the effect of differences in the severity of the initial aspiration 
event. Analysis of antibiotic-free days was restricted to post-as-
piration days 8 to 14 to exclude any effect of extended prophy-
lactic antimicrobial therapy to 7 days, which would be standard 
treatment duration for pneumonia sometimes prescribed for 
patients with acute aspiration pneumonitis.
RESULTS
Inpatient Cohort
Among 1483 patients reviewed, 200 met the case definition for 
aspiration pneumonitis and were not receiving any antibiot-
ics at the time of the aspiration event. Among these patients, 
76 (38%) received prophylactic antimicrobial therapy and 124 
(62%) received supportive management only. Prophylactic anti-
microbial therapy included ceftriaxone (n = 35, 46%), pipera-
cillin/tazobactam (n = 20, 26%), moxifloxacin or levofloxacin 
(n = 7, 9%), meropenem (n = 4, 5%), amoxicillin/clavulanate 
(n = 2, 3%), or combination (n = 8, 11%). Median duration of 
prophylactic antimicrobial exposure was 3.2 days (interquartile 
range, 1.9 – 6.0 days)
Patient baseline characteristics of both patient cohorts are 
summarized in Table 1. There were significantly more females 
among those receiving prophylactic antimicrobial therapy (51% 
vs 35%, P = .02), but the cohorts were otherwise similar with 
notably no statistically significant differences in CCI or propor-
tion with risk factors for aspiration.
Study Outcomes
During the aspiration pneumonitis time window, 34 (17%; 95% 
CI, 12%–22%) of the total patient cohort required transfer to 
critical care and 9 (4%; 95% CI, 2%–8%) died. Patients who 
were transferred to critical care or died within this aspiration 
pneumonitis time window were more likely to have received 
antimicrobial prophylaxis (OR, 2.6; 95%, CI, 1.3–5.1; P < .01).
The unadjusted and adjusted study outcomes are summa-
rized in Table 2. Unadjusted 30-day in-hospital mortality was 
similar between patients receiving prophylactic antimicrobial 
therapy (25%; 95% CI, 17%–36%) and patients receiving sup-
portive care only (25%; 95% CI, 18%–33%; P = 1). Between days 
3 and 14 following the acute aspiration pneumonitis episode, 
patients who received antimicrobial prophylaxis were no less 
likely to require transfer to critical care (5% vs 6%; P = .7). These 
patients subsequently had lower average antibiotic-free days 
compared with those managed with supportive care only (7.5 
vs 10.9; P < .0001). Similarly, escalation of antibiotic therapy

occurred more frequently among patients who received anti-
microbial prophylaxis (8%, 95% CI, 3%–16% vs 1%, 95% CI, 
0%–5%; P = .002). Table 3 describes the clinical indication and 
timing of antibiotic escalations among patients from both study 
cohorts. All escalations in antibiotics were related to worsening 
respiratory status and concern for aspiration pneumonia with 
the exception of 1 patient (number 3).
Multivariate Analysis
Results of bivariate analysis are reported in the Supplementary 
Table. The following variables were predictive of 30-day mor-
tality: age (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01–1.07; P < .05), CCI (OR, 1.2; 
95% CI, 1.05–1.3; P < .05), and being admitted to the medi-
cine service as opposed to surgery (OR, 5.2; 95% CI, 1.9–14.1; 
P < .05). After adjusting for these predictors, antimicrobial 
prophylaxis was not associated with any improvement in mor-
tality (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.4–1.7; P = .7).
Sensitivity Analyses
After excluding patients who died within 2 days of macroaspira-
tion, there remained no significant difference in 30-day in-hos-
pital mortality between patients who received prophylactic 
antimicrobial therapy and those who received supportive care 
only (22% vs 21%; P = .9). Average antibiotic-free days between 
days 8 and 14 of the aspiration event remained significantly 
lower among patients who received prophylactic antimicrobial 
therapy compared with those who received supportive care only 
(5.9 vs 6.5; P = .009).
DISCUSSION
In this single-center retrospective cohort study of patients 
with acute aspiration pneumonitis, the use of prophylactic 
antimicrobial therapy was not associated with a reduction in 
mortality or transfer to critical care compared with patients 
managed with supportive care only. Conversely, prophylactic 
antimicrobial therapy was associated with greater frequency 
of antibiotic escalation and fewer antibiotic-free days up to 2 
weeks following the acute aspiration pneumonitis episode.
Supportive care has long been recommended for patients 
with aspiration pneumonitis based on lack of evidence that 
antimicrobial therapy could prevent subsequent development 
of pneumonia, but limited published clinical data are avail-
able [4]. In 1976, Bynum and Pierce performed a smaller ret-
rospective study of patients with acute aspiration events and 
found no difference in mortality between the 37 patients who 
received prophylactic antimicrobial therapy and the 13 patients 
managed with supportive care only [1]. One other study of 47 
patients with documented aspiration suggested limited effect of 
prophylactic antimicrobial therapy on mortality [7].
Despite lack of demonstrated benefit, patients with aspiration 
pneumonitis following macroaspiration frequently receive 
prophylactic antimicrobial therapy, and this practice is not 
without potential patient harm [5, 6]. Overuse of antimicro-
bial therapy is the single most important driver of the emer-
gence of antimicrobial-resistant organisms [8, 16]. We found

that antimicrobial therapy upfront for the management of acute 
aspiration pneumonitis gives rise to the need for more antibi-
otics later, frequently with broader spectrum of activity. These 
findings support our hypothesis that prescribing post-aspira-
tion prophylaxis simply generates antibiotic selective pressures 
that result in the need for escalation of antimicrobial therapy in 
the event of development of aspiration pneumonia. Conversely, 
supportive management of patients with acute aspiration pneu-
monitis may preserve the use of antimicrobial agents for the 
development of signs of infective pulmonary process, allowing 
for shorter targeted antibiotic treatment.
Distinguishing aspiration pneumonitis from aspiration 
pneumonia is not always unambiguous in clinical practice, 
especially in the absence of a witnessed aspiration event or a 
patient with several days of preceding cough or dyspnea that 
may suggest underlying pneumonia. The benefit of antimicro-
bial therapy in reducing mortality for patients with pneumonia 
is undisputable, and clinical judgment is required. In our study, 
we specifically selected patients unlikely to have underlying 
pneumonia since they all had documented macroaspiration 
events and were not receiving prior antibiotics. These patients 
are generally easy to recognize in clinical practice when aspir-
ation is witnessed, resulting in sudden respiratory deterioration 
without a prior history of respiratory symptoms [5, 6, 17].
Our study has several important strengths. To our knowledge, 
this is the largest cohort of patients with acute aspiration pneu-
monitis for whom the clinical utility of prophylactic antimicrobial 
therapy was assessed. More than 1400 patients were reviewed span-
ning records from over 6-years  to identify this 200-patient cohort. 
The case definition used allows for easy and consistent identifica-
tion in clinical practice, as demonstrated by the high interrate reli-
ability between independent clinician abstractors. Furthermore, 
the abstractors were blinded to the exposure of prophylactic anti-
microbial therapy during data collection to exclude potential bias.

Several important limitations should also be noted. First, 
the observational retrospective nature of our study is subject 
to confounding variables that may have influenced patient 
outcomes. Confounding by indication was likely present in 
that patients with more severe aspiration pneumonitis epi-
sodes tended to receive prophylactic antimicrobial therapy. 
However, no difference in outcomes was noted following mul-
tivariate analysis adjusting for measurable confounders, nor 
following a sensitivity analysis excluding patients with the 
poorest clinical outcome during the acute aspiration pneu-
monitis episode. Second, despite the large number of patients 
reviewed, our study cohort is relatively small and not powered 
to detect a less than 10% difference in mortality. Third, our 
study was not designed to evaluate the impact of prophylac-
tic antimicrobial therapy on the development of pneumonia. 
We instead focused on mortality as a more objective clinical 
outcome due to the lack of a gold standard to assess pneu-
monia. Based on our observation that prophylactic antimicro-
bial therapy was associated with a greater need for subsequent 
antibiotics, it may be inferred that this therapy was ineffective 
in preventing pneumonia as suggested in other studies [1, 7]. 
Finally, our study only included non-mechanically ventilated 
patients with documented macroaspiration events with acute 
aspiration pneumonitis and would not apply to patients with 
silent aspiration or in whom the diagnosis of aspiration pneu-
monitis is ambiguous.
Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy for patients with acute 
aspiration pneumonitis does not offer clinical benefit and may 
generate antibiotic selective pressures that result in the need for 
escalation of antibiotic therapy among those who develop aspir-
ation pneumonia. Supportive care should remain the mainstay 
of management of patients with acute aspiration pneumonitis 
following a macroaspiration event.
