IMPORTANCE In China, the patterns and levels of physical activity differed from those in
high-income countries. Substantial uncertainty remains about the relevance, both
qualitatively and quantitatively, of domain-specific physical activity for cardiovascular disease
(CVD) subtypes in Chinese adults.
OBJECTIVE To assess the shape and strength of the associations of total, occupational, and
nonoccupational physical activity with CVD subtypes in Chinese men and women.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based prospective cohort study in 10 (5
urban, 5 rural) areas across China included 487 334 adults who were aged 30 to 79 (mean 51)
years with no prior CVD history when enrolled from June 2004 to July 2008.
EXPOSURES Self-reported total, occupational, and nonoccupational physical activity,
quantified as metabolic equivalent of task hours per day (MET-h/d) based on the type,
frequency, and duration of specific activities.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Major vascular events (n = 36 184) and their components,
including major coronary events (n = 5082), ischemic stroke (n = 25 647), intracerebral
hemorrhage (n = 5252), and CVD death (n = 8437). Cox regression yielded adjusted hazard
ratios for each disease that was associated with physical activity.
RESULTS Of the 487 334 study participants, 287 527 (59%) were women and the mean (SD)
age was 51 (10.5) years. The overall mean (SD) total physical activity was 21.5 (12.8) MET-h/d,
mainly from occupational activity, especially among men (75% vs 50% in women). Total
physical activity was inversely associated with the risk of major vascular events, with the
adjusted hazard ratio that compared the top vs bottom quintiles of physical activity being
0.77 (95% CI, 0.74-0.80). Throughout the range of total physical activity studied, the
association with CVD with each 4 MET-h/d higher usual total physical activity (approximately
1 hour of brisk walking per day) associated with a 6% (95% CI, 5%-7%) lower risk of major
vascular events, and a 9%, 5%, 6%, and 12% lower risk of major coronary events, ischemic
stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and CVD death, respectively. The strength of the
associations was similar and independent of each other for occupational and nonoccupational
physical activity. However, for occupational physical activity, the associations with CVD
subtypes were greatly attenuated above 20 MET-h/d, especially for intracerebral
hemorrhage. The associations of total physical activity with major vascular events were
similar among men and women and across different levels of sedentary leisure time but were
much weaker among individuals with high blood pressure.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among Chinese adults, higher occupational or
nonoccupational physical activity was associated with significantly lower risks of major CVD.

 L
ow levels of physical activity are an important modifi-
able risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD).1 In re-
cent decades, levels of physical activity have declined
worldwide, including in China, mainly because of rapid ur-
banization,reducedphysicalactivityintheworkplace,changes
in modes of transportation, and other aspects of lifestyle.2 The
Global Burden of Diseases report estimated that low levels of
physical activity accounted for 2.1 million premature deaths
and 4.5 million disability-adjusted life-years worldwide in
2013.3 These estimates were mainly based on studies in high-
income countries where patterns and levels of physical activ-
ity differed appreciably from those in low-income and middle-
incomecountries,includingChina.4WithinChinatherearealso
large differences in physical activity levels between urban and
ruralareas.5PreviousstudiesofphysicalactivitylevelsinChina
have been constrained by a small number of events6 that con-
sideredonlyfataloutcomes,7coveredasinglegeographicarea,8

bination of these constraints.10
Total physical activity is composed of occupational, com-
muting, household, and leisure time physical activity. Higher
levels of both occupational and leisure time physical activity
have been associated with lower risks of CVD in high-income
countries.11 There is evidence that higher levels of physical ac-
tivity may also offset the risks of CVD that are associated with
high levels of sedentary leisure time.12,13 In China, there has
been a substantial shift from labor-intensive lifestyles to more
sedentary lifestyles in recent decades,14 but the relevance of
occupational and nonoccupational (including leisure time)
physical activity for risks of subtypes of CVD, both overall and
among different population subgroups (eg, different ages or
levels of blood pressure), is lacking.15,16 Moreover, the dis-
easepatternsinChinadifferimportantlyfromthoseinthehigh-
income countries (eg, there are higher rates of stroke than is-
chemicheartdisease[IHD]inChina)andalsovarysignificantly
between regions.4,17 Reliable assessment of the association of
physical activity levels with different subtypes of CVD (par-
ticularly stroke) in China is needed to inform disease preven-
tion programs. Based on data from a large prospective study
of Chinese adults, the present study aimed to (1) quantify the
associationsoftotal,occupational,andnonoccupationalphysi-
cal activity with the risks of several major subtypes of CVD;
(2) assess whether these associations differed by age, sex, and
differentlevelsofbaselineriskfactors(eg,bloodpressure);and
(3)examinethejointeffectsoftotalphysicalactivitylevelswith
sedentary leisure time and of occupational with nonoccupa-
tional physical activity.
Methods
Study Population
Details of the study design and methods of the China
Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) have been previously reported.18-20
Briefly, participants were recruited from 10 (5 urban and 5
rural) diverse areas in China, chosen from China’
s nationally
representative Disease Surveillance Points (DSP) system21 to
maximize geographic and socioeconomic diversity (eFigure 1
intheSupplement).All1 801 200registeredresidentswhowere
thought to be 35 to 74 years in the study areas were identified
through local residential records and invited to attend study
clinics between June 2004 and July 2008. Overall, 512 891 (the
response rate was around 30%) participated, including 12 665
who were just outside this age range (making the actual base-
line age range from 30-79 years). Individuals with prior phy-
sician-diagnosed IHD (n = 15 472), those who had experi-
enced a stroke/transient ischemic attack (n = 8884), and those
that reported implausibly small, large, or conflicting levels of
physical activity (n = 10 201) were excluded, leaving 487 334
participants for this analysis.
Trained health workers administered a laptop-based ques-
tionnaire on demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle fac-
tors (eg, smoking, alcohol drinking, diet, physical activity lev-
els, and medical history) and measured height, weight, waist
and hip circumference, blood pressure, and lung function.
Blood samples were collected for the onsite testing of ran-
domplasmaglucoselevels(SureStepPlusSystem,Johnsonand
Johnson) and then separated into plasma and buffy coat frac-
tions for long-term storage. Periodic resurveys were con-
ducted on approximately 25 000 (5%) of the randomly se-
lected surviving participants. Before the study began, ethical
approval was obtained from local, national, and interna-
tional ethics committees. All participants provided written in-
formed consent.
Physical Activity Measurements
The details of the methods that were used to assess physical
activity have been previously reported16,22 and were compa-
rable with the methods that were used in previous studies in
both high-income23 and Chinese24 populations. The CKB base-
line physical activity questionnaire covered relevant ques-
tions on the intensity, frequency, and time spent on occupa-
tional tasks, commuting, household tasks, and leisure time
activities (see detailed questionnaire at http://www.ckbiobank
.org), but has not been compared directly with a reference
method, such as an accelerometer. Metabolic equivalents of
task (METs) of different types of activities were adopted from
the 2011 compendium of physical activities25 (eTable 1 in the
Key Points
Question What are the shape and strength of the associations
between physical activity and risks of major cardiovascular
diseases (CVDs)?
Findings In a 7.5-year study of 487 334 adults without prior CVD
from 10 areas in China, total, occupational, and nonoccupational
physical activity showed an inverse dose-response association
with risk of CVD, with each 4 metabolic equivalent of task hours
per day higher activity (approximately 1 hour per day cycling or
brisk walking) associated with a 5% to 12% lower risk of
developing various types of CVD.
Meaning Among Chinese adults, higher physical activity may be
associated with lower CVD risk, reinforcing current guidelines that
promote any physical activity for CVD prevention.

cal activity that was performed during paid employment. Non-
occupationalphysicalactivityincludedallphysicalactivitythat
was performed during travel to and from work, household ac-
tivity, and leisure-time activity (excluding sedentary leisure
time activities, such as watching television or reading).16 The
MET of each activity was subsequently multiplied by the fre-
quency and duration of physical activity to calculate total
physical activity in MET hours per day (MET-h/d).
Follow-up for Morbidity and Mortality Rates
All10studyregionsarepartofDSPsystem,whichprovidesmor-
tality rate statistics for the entire country.21 The vital status of
all participants was monitored periodically through DSP death
registries as well as health insurance systems and was supple-
mented by annual active confirmation of survival through lo-
cal street committees or village administrators. The underly-
ing causes of death were coded by trained DSP staff members
who used International Statistical Classification of Diseases and
Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)26 and were
blinded to the baseline information. Data on nonfatal disease
outcomeswereobtainedbylinkage,usingeachparticipant’

sonalidentificationnumber,withestablishedlocalchronicdis-
easeregistries(eg,IHDandstroke)andwiththeNationalHealth
Insurance claim system, which provided almost universal (ap-
proximately99%)coverageofallhospitalizedeventsinallstudy
regions. By January 1, 2015, 25 488 participants (5%) had died
and 2411 (0.4%) were lost to follow-up.
Theprimaryoutcomesexaminedinthepresentstudywere
first major coronary events (MCEs) (fatal IHD [ICD-10: I20-
I25]ornonfatalmyocardialinfarction[I21-I23]),ischemicstroke
(IS) (I63), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) (I61), cardiovascu-
lar death (I00-I99), and major vascular events (MVEs) (any of
the previously mentioned events plus other types of nonfatal
stroke [I60 and I64]).
Statistical Analyses
Selected characteristics of the study participants were com-
pared by quintiles of total physical activity, after adjusting for
age (5-year groups), sex, and region using linear or logistic re-
gression when appropriate. Cox regression analysis was used
to obtain hazard ratios (HRs) for CVD events that were associ-
atedwithquintilesoftotalphysicalactivity.Analyseswerestrati-
fied by age at risk (5-year intervals), sex, and region (10 groups)
and adjusted for household income, education, alcohol
consumption(allused6groups),smoking(4groups),freshfruit
intake(5groups),sedentaryleisuretime,andself-reportedgen-
eralhealthstatus(4groups).Analysesofoccupationalandnon-
occupational physical activity levels also included additional
mutualadjustmentforeachother.TheHRsand95%CIsforquin-
tiles of physical activity were computed using floating abso-
lute risks (such that the HR in each group, including the one for
the reference group, was associated with a group-specific 95%
CIthatreflectedtheamountofdatainthatcategory).27Thepro-
portional hazards assumptions for the Cox model were as-
sessed using standard methods and were satisfied.28
The combined effects of measurement error and within-
person variability mean that using a single measurement of
physical activity at baseline can lead to a substantial under-
estimation (ie, “regression dilution bias”) of the importance
of physical activity levels to disease risk.29 Therefore, risk es-
timates were corrected for regression dilution bias using physi-
cal activity–level data collected at resurvey among approxi-
mately 20 000 participants (conducted around 3 years after
thebaselinesurvey).Theregressiondilutionratios(RDRs)were
calculated using the McMahon-Peto method, which uses the
ratio of the ranges (top vs bottom quintile, defined by base-
line physical activity) of the mean physical activity levels at
resurvey to the range of such measurements at baseline.30 For
comparison, we also computed RDRs using the correlation be-
tween measurements for participants with baseline and re-
survey data.31 A departure from linearity was assessed using
thelikelihoodratiotestandlogHRsper4MET-h/dhigherbase-
line physical activity levels were then multiplied by the recip-
rocal of the RDRs to obtain HRs (and associated 95% CI) for the
usual physical activity level. Physical activity results were pre-
sented as the HRs per 4 MET-h/d higher usual physical activ-
ity (equivalent to 1 hour of walking per day) with CVD.
The joint effects of total physical activity levels and sed-
entary leisure time were assessed by creating 9 groups based
on tertiles, of both total physical activity and sedentary lei-
sure time, using Cox regression to estimate the HRs of MVE
for each group. Likewise, the joint effects of tertiles of occu-
pational and nonoccupational physical activity were also as-
sessed by similar methods.
Sensitivity analyses excluded participants who reported
other chronic diseases, poor self-rated general health at base-
line, and CVD events that occurred during the first 3 years of
follow-up. In addition, we examined the effect of sequential
adjustment for many lifestyle factors, dietary factors, and
physical measurements. Analyses used 2-sided P values with-
out any correction for multiple testing, but allowances for mul-
tiple comparisons were made by using 99% CIs for subgroup
analyses. Statistical significance was set at P = .05. All analy-
ses were conducted using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute) and
R, version 3.0.1 (R Foundation).
Results
Baseline Characteristics of Participants by Physical Activity
Among the 487 334 participants, the mean (SD) age at base-
line was 51 (10.5) years, 287 527 (59%) were women, and
204 680 (42%) resided in urban areas (Table). Individuals with
highertotalphysicalactivitylevelsweremorelikelytobemale,
younger, and living in rural areas, and have lower levels of edu-
cation than those with lower physical activity levels. Like-
wise, higher total physical activity was also associated with
better health (eg, less diabetes or hypertension); lower blood
pressure, heart rates, and body mass index (calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared); and
more favorable blood biochemistry profiles (eg, lower low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol, C-reactive protein, cystatin C)
(eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Mean (SD) levels of total physical activity were higher
among men than women (22.9 [12.8] vs 20.6 [12.8] MET-h/d,

 respectively), with men having higher occupational (17.4
[12.4] vs 10.6 [12.4] MET-h/d, respectively) but lower nonoc-
cupational physical activity levels (5.5 [4.4] vs 10.0 [4.4]
MET-h/d, respectively) than women (eTable 3 in the Supple-
ment). Thus, occupational physical activity accounted for a
higher proportion of total physical activity in men than in
women (75% vs 50%, respectively) and in those living in rural
areas rather than urban areas (65% vs 58%, respectively)
(eTable 3 in the Supplement). By contrast, the time engaged
in sedentary leisure time activity was similar among men and
women (3.1 vs 2.9 hours per day, respectively, in both urban
and rural areas) (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Associations of Total Physical Activity With Major
Vascular Disease Events
During 3.8 million person-years of follow-up, there were 36 184
MVEs, including 5082 MCE, 25 647 IS, 5252 ICH, and 8437 par-
ticipants who died of CVD. Total physical activity levels were
approximately log-linearly and were inversely associated with
theriskofMVEintherangeofabout10to20MET-h/d(Figure1).
Individualsinthetopquintileoftotalphysicalactivityhada23%
lowerriskofdevelopingMVE(HR,0.77;95%CI,0.74-0.80)com-
pared with those in the bottom quintile. Likewise, total physi-
cal activity levels were linearly and inversely associated with
each subtype of MVE (except for ICH, for which the associa-
tion was attenuated at higher levels of total physical activity)
(Figure 2C). For specific types of CVD, the adjusted HRs for the
top vs bottom quintile of baseline total physical activity were
0.69 (95% CI, 0.62-0.77) for MCE, 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75-0.82) for
IS,0.77(95%CI,0.71-0.83)forICH,and0.59(0.55-0.64)forCVD
death (Figure 2; eTable 4 in the Supplement). The analyses of
event rates by quintile of physical activity showed generally
lower event rates by outcome for total and nonoccupational
physical activity (eTable 5 in the Supplement).

 The estimated RDRs were 0.53 for total (0.63 and 0.50 for
occupational and nonoccupational physical activity, respec-
tively)physicalactivityandthecorrelationresultswerebroadly
similar (eTable 6 in the Supplement). By applying these RDRs,
each 4 usual MET-h/d higher levels of total physical activity
was associated with 6%, 9%, 5%, 6%, and 12% lower risks of
MVE, MCE, IS, ICH, and CVD death, respectively (Figure 1 and
Figure 2). For each outcome, the shape and strength of these
associations across the range of total physical activity were
broadly similar for residents who were living in urban and ru-
ral areas and among men and women (eFigures 2-6 in the
Supplement).
Associations of Occupational and Nonoccupational
Activity With Major Vascular Disease Events
Within the range of 2 to 12 MET-h/d, the shape and strength of
the inverse associations with specific types of CVD were simi-
lar for occupational and nonoccupational physical activity
(Figure 3; eTable 4 in the Supplement). For occupational physi-
cal activity, there was a flattening of the inverse association at
approximately 20 MET-h/d for all outcomes, while for ICH the
association was greatly attenuated above 20 MET-h/d
(Figure3A).Fornonoccupationalphysicalactivity,therewasan

elsweresimilaracrossdifferentlevelsofsedentaryleisuretime
(Figure 4A). Likewise, the inverse relationships of MVE with
usual occupational physical activity levels were unaltered by
different levels of nonoccupational physical activity
(Figure 4B).
Analyses by Participant Baseline Characteristics
and by Further Adjustments or Exclusions
For each CVD outcome, the strength of the associations per 4
higher usual MET-h/d of physical activity was broadly similar
between urban and rural areas and among subgroups that were
classified by levels of alcohol consumption, smoking status, or
self-reported health status (eFigures 12-14 in the Supplement).
However, the effects appeared to be modified significantly by
blood pressure and, to a lesser extent, by adiposity. Among
people with a baseline systolic blood pressure of less than 140
mm Hg, 140 to 160 mm Hg, and more than 160 mm Hg, the ad-
justed HRs for MVE per 4 higher usual MET-h/d were 0.91 (95%
CI, 0.90-0.93), 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95-0.99), and 1.03 (95% CI, 1.01-
1.05), respectively (P < .001), with similar patterns of associa-
tion for each specific type of CVD (that were largely unaltered
when using different clinical categorizations of systolic blood
pressure, or when excluding those who were receiving blood
pressure–lowering treatment). For MCE and CVD death, there
was evidence of a somewhat stronger association among
women and older participants (eFigures 13A and 14B in the
Supplement).
Additional adjustments for other CVD risk factors (eg, adi-
posity, systolic blood pressure, dietary factors, lung function,
and heart rate) attenuated the strength of the associations with
MVE, as reflected by a decrease in the χ2 statistic. However, the
inverse associations persisted throughout the ranges that were
observedfortheseadjustments(eFigure15intheSupplement).
The exclusion of participants with other prior nonvascular dis-
eases,poorself-ratedhealth,andCVDeventsthatoccurreddur-
ing the first 3 years of follow-up had little effect on the overall
observed associations (eTable 7 in the Supplement).
Discussion
ThislargeprospectivestudyinChinademonstratedthathigher
levels of physical activity had a strong inverse dose-response
relationship with all major subtypes of CVD in both men and
women. Throughout the range examined, a 4 MET-h/d higher
level of physical activity (that could be obtained from either
occupationalornonoccupationalactivities)wasassociatedwith
highly statistically significant 5% to 12% lower risks of differ-
ent subtypes of CVD. These effects were similar, and largely
independent of each other, for both occupational and nonoc-
cupational physical activity by different levels of sedentary lei-
suretime,asreportedinotherstudies.12,32,33However,athigher
levels of occupational physical activity (ie, >20 MET-h/d) the
association with CVD events appeared to have flattened, es-
pecially for ICH.

quintiles of total physical activity after adjustment for age, sex, region,
household income, education, alcohol consumption, smoking, fresh fruit intake,
sedentary leisure time, and self-reported general health status. The size of the
squares is proportional to the inverse variance of each effect size. The dashed
line represents the slope from a weighted linear regression with weights based
on the inverse variance of the log hazard ratios. The hazard ratio per 4 usual

 A meta-analysis of 21 prospective studies that involved
20 000 CVD events reported that moderate levels of occupa-
tional physical activity were associated with an approxi-
mately 10% lower risk of both stroke and coronary heart
disease in men, but with somewhat larger effects in women,
especially for coronary heart disease.11 With almost twice the
number of vascular events recorded as in that meta-analysis,
this study demonstrated no major quantitative differences in
the effects of physical activity levels on stroke between men
and women, but with somewhat greater benefits for women
for MCE and CVD death, consistent with previous findings in
high-income populations.11 Findings from previous studies
on stroke subtypes were inconclusive, with many studies
having insufficient power to examine hemorrhagic stroke
reliably,34,35 while a few other studies found no evidence of
any differences between subtypes.36 Moreover, the range of
physical activity levels examined in most previous studies
was narrower than in this study, and tended to focus on
fewer domains of physical activity.35,37,38 The present study
demonstrated that while the inverse relationship with ische-
mic stroke was log-linear throughout the range of total physi-
cal activity that was examined, the association with ICH was
log-linear up to levels of about 20 MET-h/d with an attenua-
tion of the association thereafter. This attenuation was
chiefly accounted for by occupational physical activity, sug-
gesting that engaging in strenuous occupational activities
(eg, approximately 6 MET) for more than 3 hours a day (ie,
approximately 20 MET-h/d) may be somewhat less beneficial
for ICH compared with those who engaged in more moderate
levels of physical activity.

 In a prospective study of UK women that involved 1800
ICH events,39 strenuous activity was associated with about a
20% lower risk of ICH for nondaily vs inactive but a nonsig-
nificant 5% excess risk (95% CI, −33% to 17%) for daily strenu-
ous activity vs inactive.39 In a recent Japanese cohort of 74 913
individuals with 1007 hemorrhagic stroke there was a J-
shaped association of total physical activity (with a similar
range to CKB) with hemorrhagic stroke.40 In the present study
there was some evidence of increased risk of MVE, IS, and ICH
among participants with a baseline systolic blood pressure of
more than 160 mm Hg. In China, including those enrolled into
CKB,fewerthan10%ofindividualswithhypertensionhadtheir
blood pressure properly treated and controlled41 and vigor-
ous physical activity in individuals with uncontrolled hyper-
tension may be harmful.
The associations of higher physical activity levels and CVD
events may be mediated partly through established CVD risk
factors, including improved profiles of inflammation, adipos-
ity, blood lipids, and blood pressure.42 Indeed, in this study,
physical activity levels were weakly associated with adipos-
ity and blood pressure and among a subset of the participants
with blood lipids and markers of inflammation.
Strengths and Limitations
This study’
s chief strengths are the large sample size that per-
mits the assessments of risk across a wider range of physical
activity, information on both occupational and nonoccupa-
tionalphysicalactivity,andassociationswithbothnonfataland
fatal vascular disease. Moreover, we were able to examine the
associations, both shape and strength, across several impor-
tant population subgroups such as by age, sex, adiposity, and
blood pressure. However, the present study had several limi-
tations, including self-reported physical activity only, no data
that objectively quantified physical activity,43 and no data on
cardiorespiratory fitness.44 Although the risk estimates for
physical activity were corrected for regression dilution bias,
we could not correct for measurement errors in covariates. De-
spite excluding the first 3 years of follow-up and individuals
with prior diseases or poor health status, it is possible that re-
verse causality may still be present and residual confounding
because of unknown, unmeasured factors (eg, lipids) or sub-
optimallymeasuredfactors(eg,dietaryfactors)cannotbecom-
pletely discounted.
Conclusions
This study provides new evidence that higher levels of total or
domain-specificphysicalactivitywereinverselyassociatedwith
risks of major cardiovascular diseases in Chinese adults. These
associations appear to be proportional to the amount of physi-
cal activity that was undertaken within a broad range of physi-
calactivitytypicallyseeninlow-andmiddle-incomecountries,
especially among those without hypertension.

Invited Commentary
Physical Activity to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease
A Simple, Low-Cost, and Widely Applicable Approach
for All Populations
Scott A. Lear, PhD; Salim Yusuf, DPhil
Regular physical activity (PA) is one of the simplest ways for
individuals and populations to reduce the risk of premature
death and incident cardiovascular disease (CVD). Participat-
ing in PA has been associated with lower CVD risk in observa-
tional studies of people with
and without prior CVD1,2 as
well as in randomized clini-
cal trials with people with CVD.3 These studies have almost all
been conducted in high-income countries where leisure or rec-
reational PA is the predominant form of PA. However, glob-
ally, 80% of CVD deaths occurs in middle-income and low-
income countries, where it is the leading cause of death. In
thesecountries,PAismainlynonrecreationalandtherearefew
studies that have reported on the association of such PA on
clinical outcomes.
In this issue of JAMA Cardiology, Bennett et al4 investi-
gate the association between PA and major CVD in 487 334
Chinese men and women from the China Kadoorie Biobank
(CKB).4 The authors should be congratulated for what is one
of the largest investigations of its kind among a key popula-
tion (China, which constitutes the largest country in the
world and is a middle-income country). The authors reported
