ABSTRACT
Objectives: Conduct a feasibility study on the effect of
menstrual hygiene on schoolgirls’ school and health
(reproductive/sexual) outcomes.
Design: 3-arm single-site open cluster randomised
controlled pilot study.
Setting: 30 primary schools in rural western Kenya,
within a Health and Demographic Surveillance System.
Participants: Primary schoolgirls 14–16 years,
experienced 3 menses, no precluding disability, and
resident in the study area.
Interventions: 1 insertable menstrual cup, or monthly
sanitary pads, against ‘usual practice’ control. All
participants received puberty education preintervention,
and hand wash soap during intervention. Schools
received hand wash soap.
Primary and secondary outcome measures:
Primary: school attrition (drop-out, absence);
secondary: sexually transmitted infection (STI)
(Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis,
Neisseria gonorrhoea), reproductive tract infection
(RTI) (bacterial vaginosis, Candida albicans); safety:
toxic shock syndrome, vaginal Staphylococcus aureus.
Results: Of 751 girls enrolled 644 were followed-up
for a median of 10.9 months. Cups or pads did not
reduce school dropout risk (control=8.0%,
cups=11.2%, pads=10.2%). Self-reported absence was
rarely reported and not assessable. Prevalence of STIs
in the end-of-study survey among controls was 7.7%
versus 4.2% in the cups arm (adjusted prevalence ratio
(aPR) 0.48, 0.24 to 0.96, p=0.039), 4.5% with pads
(aPR=0.62; 0.37 to 1.03, p=0.063), and 4.3% with
cups and pads pooled (aPR=0.54, 0.34 to 0.87,
p=0.012). RTI prevalence was 21.5%, 28.5% and
26.9% among cup, pad and control arms, 71% of
which were bacterial vaginosis, with a prevalence of
14.6%, 19.8% and 20.5%, per arm, respectively.
Bacterial vaginosis was less prevalent in the cups
(12.9%) compared with pads (20.3%, aPR=0.65, 0.44
to 0.97, p=0.034) and control (19.2%, aPR=0.67, 0.43
to 1.04, p=0.075) arm girls enrolled for 9 months or
longer. No adverse events were identified.
Conclusions: Provision of menstrual cups and
sanitary pads for ∼1 school-year was associated with a
lower STI risk, and cups with a lower bacterial
vaginosis risk, but there was no association with
school dropout. A large-scale trial on menstrual cups
is warranted.
Trial registration: ISRCTN17486946; Results
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ This is the first cluster randomised controlled
study of menstrual products examining the effect
of interventions on dropout, sexually transmitted
infection and reproductive tract infection among
schoolgirls.
▪ Follow-up
of
participants
longitudinally
for
9 months or more demonstrated the importance
of product familiarisation before measureable
effects were generated.
▪ Participant follow-up back to homes differen-
tiated migration (loss to follow-up) from school
dropout.
▪ Frequent follow-up to evaluate use and safety
may have positively influenced participants’ atti-
tudes to attending school, affecting school out-
comes, including in the control arm.
▪ Studies on menstruation in rural African primary
schoolgirls are compromised by the increasingly
younger age girls’ complete school, with fewer
girls reaching menarche during primary school.

 INTRODUCTION
Poor menstrual hygiene management (MHM) affects
the dignity, health and well-being of schoolgirls in low
and middle income countries (LMIC), and requires a
range of Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) inter-
ventions.1 2 Many girls in LMIC cannot afford sanitary
pads and resort to impromptu items like old cloth or
cotton wool, or use a minimal number of pads, which
leak, smell and chafe, causing them stigma, shame and
discomfort.3–6 The use of unhygienic cloths for menstru-
ation is associated with reproductive tract infection
(RTI) symptoms, requiring verification.7–9 Qualitative
studies show that poor MHM reduces a girl’s ability to
engage in class and may cause school absence and
dropout.3–5 10 School absence contributes to girls’ life-
chances by lowering performance, increasing grade
repetition, pregnancy risk and dropout.11 However, no
strong association has been found between absence and
menstrual intervention to date,10 12–16 and none have
examined school dropout. Remaining in school acts as a
‘social vaccine’,17 protecting girls against sexually trans-
mitted infections (STIs) and reproductive harms.11 18 19
Evidence is accruing that young adolescent girls en-
gage in transactional sex to obtain sanitary pads.3 20–24
In western Kenya, where HIV incidence rises sharply
among adolescent girls,22 10% of girls 15 years or
younger admitted having transactional sex to obtain
money to buy pads.24 Such behaviour can contribute to
girls’ exposure to STI,25 HIV,22 pregnancy and subse-
quent school dropout.23 Further, should provision of
hygienic menstrual products affect the prevalence of
bacterial vaginosis,7–9 this could impact on girls’ suscep-
tibility to STI,26–29 and HIV.30 31 While two exploratory
controlled studies providing pads and menstrual cups to
Ghanaian and Nepalese schoolgirls, respectively, demon-
strated marginal effect on school absence, they did not
examine STI or RTI outcomes.10 14 Menstrual cups have
also been tested among women, showing women’s
increased preference for use over their usual practice,
and no safety issues.32–35 We conducted a feasibility
study to examine the acceptability and safety of men-
strual cups and sanitary pads among primary schoolgirls
in rural western Kenya and to obtain preliminary esti-
mates of the effect sizes on a range of potential primary
outcomes including school dropout, STIs and RTIs to
support the design of a subsequent larger trial. The
results of nested studies on study girls’ menstrual needs
and perceived benefits of using menstrual cups and sani-
tary pads are reported elsewhere.3 36–39
METHODS
Study design and participants
This was a three-arm, open-label, cluster randomised
controlled feasibility study in 30 primary schools located
in
a
rural
area
under
a
continuous
Health
and
Demographic
Surveillance
System
HDSS,health
and
demographic
surveillance
system
(HDSS)
in
Gem
District in Siaya County in western Kenya.40 In this area,
girls
have
little
access
to
hygienic
menstrual
pro-
ducts,3 23 24 36 and are frequently exposed to sexual
harms,3 22–24 reflected in the rapid increase in HIV and
herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) prevalence in girls
between 13 and 18 years of age from ∼1% to 12.8% and
9% to 40%, respectively.22
There were 71 primary schools within the HDSS area
in Gem District; 62 agreed to participate,36 five of which
were ineligible (enrolled in another study, or missed eli-
gible class years). Of the 57 remaining schools, 30 ful-
filled
the
WASH
eligibility
criteria consisting
of
a
separate girls’ toilet block present, water present at spot-
check, and a pupil–latrine ratio<70:1.
Schoolgirls were eligible if they were 14–16 years old,
had no precluding disability, had experienced at least
three menses, were resident for at least 4 months in the
study area, and provided written assent (schoolgirl) and
consent (parents/caregivers). Girls who were reported
to be pregnant or were with visible pregnancies were
excluded.
A sample size of 185 girls per arm from a population
of 3165 girls was estimated to provide 5% precision of
school dropout (primary outcome) if this occurred at
15% in the control arm. To allow for a design effect of
1.25 and 7.5% loss to follow-up, 250 girls (10 schools
with an average of 25 girls per school) were scheduled
for recruitment per arm. This same sample size would
provide 4.6% and 4.2% precision if school dropout was
12.5% or 10%, respectively, in the intervention groups.
Randomisation and blinding
The 30 eligible schools were matched in triplicate by the
trial statistician based on the pupil–latrine ratio obtained
from a baseline WASH study.36 Prior to a community
randomisation ceremony, attended by all head teachers
and District Education Officers (DEO), allocation assign-
ments were sealed in three identical opaque envelopes
by a non-involved administrator. During the ceremony,
10 sets of three head teachers, one for each school in a
matched triplet, simultaneously picked and displayed
one of three colour balls from an opaque bag. After all
balls were chosen, a DEO opened the three envelopes to
reveal the colour-allocated assignment. Following ran-
domisation, participants and study nurses were made
aware of the allocation, but allocation was concealed
from the laboratory staff and the trial statistician until
the database was locked.
Procedures
Meetings were held
in the
30 study schools with
parents/caregivers, target-aged girls, and teachers to
discuss the study and answer questions. Girls’ homes
were visited to provide information sheets, discuss the
study with parents, and obtain parents’ written consent.
Information on geolocation of girls’ residence was
obtained from the HDSS database. Class meetings with
girls described the study, provided information sheets

 and encouraged and answered questions, before obtain-
ing participants’ written assent.
At
enrolment,
individual
participant’s
baseline
characteristics were gathered through nurse interview
and behavioural survey tools.24 Well-being was assessed
using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PEDSQL)
instrument.41 Household-level characteristics and socio-
economic status (SES) were obtained using the existing
HDSS data.42 School-level characteristics on size and
WASH were collected through unannounced spot-checks
at baseline, and twice
per
term
over
the
study.36
Participants were provided with adapted monthly calen-
dars,14 to self-record daily school attendance and men-
struation. This documented which days girls had their
menstruation and which days they were absent from
school. Calendars were formatted as a teleform; data was
captured from weekly scanning of images to the local
database, and then extracted to the raw database.
Health facilities in the study area were visited to explain
the study, toxic shock syndrome (TSS) symptoms and
the process of tertiary care referral, and the researcher’s
contact details given. Communication was established
with district hospitals for suspected TSS admissions.
Participants, families, and schools received written infor-
mation about the study, TSS symptoms, how to contact
the study staff, and health facility referral.
Kenyan registered study nurses employed full time
during the study visited schools weekly to follow-up girls
and assess any safety issues. At each scheduled follow-up,
nurses
documented
menstruation,
intervention
use,
adverse events, and any problems on a one-to-one basis.
Nurses physically checked girls’ cups to ascertain use (by
cup colour change), damage, or loss. Girls were referred
to the district hospital gynaecologist for clinical assess-
ment if required. The trained nurses instructed girls to
self-complete a vaginal swab for Staphylococcus aureus,43 to
evaluate vaginal colonisation, and positives were retested
to evaluate the prevalence of TSS toxin production. A
random sample of 35 cups was obtained to evaluate
Escherichia coli growth. HDSS census and health clinic
record reviews were conducted to assess any deaths, TSS,
or other severe adverse events among participants.
Homes of all girls absent for a term were visited to
document reasons for non-attendance, whether the par-
ticipant had dropped out of school or was temporarily
absent (eg, due to illness) or had migrated and when,
and whether they were pregnant. If pregnant, informa-
tion was collected to establish the estimated delivery
time (ie, the dates of last menstrual period or concep-
tion, if known) and the birth outcome if delivery had
taken place. This was conducted by community health
workers in each village trained as ‘village recorders’
(VR) within the HDSS. Lists of absent girls and the geo-
location of their residence were forwarded to each VR
for
follow-up.
Participant
dropout
was
identified
through a computer-generated list of girls absent from
nurse screening each term. Nurses verified with teaching
staff if the listed participants did not attend school the
previous term. If girls failed to attend a scheduled nurse
screening visit but were reported as present in the
school, an alternate screening visit date was arranged, or
if the girl refused to attend a screening visit it was
explored whether the girl intended to withdraw from
the study. If girls were found to be absent from the
school and if teachers confirmed non-attendance or did
not know, girls were scheduled to be visited at home by
a VR. All girls were visited at home at the end of the
study to validate earlier findings, plus capture any
missed dropouts, pregnancies, and pregnancy outcomes.
At the end of the study, RTI/STI vaginal swabs were
taken by girls with training and assistance from study
nurses in a private room at school and girls’ symptoms
documented.25 Specimen were processed at KEMRI
laboratories using AMPLICOR PCR for Neisseria gonor-
rhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis detection; in pouch
microscopy for Trichomonas vaginalis and Candida albi-
cans, and Gram stain for bacterial vaginosis, and the
Nugent
Score
(7–10)
counted
for
Gardnerella,
Lactobacillus, and Mobiluncus.43
Interventions
All girls within the study schools who fulfilled the eligi-
bility criteria at the start of the study were enrolled. If
girls had not yet reached menarche, but otherwise ful-
filled all other entry criteria, they were eligible for enrol-
ment during the course of the study as soon as they
started menstruating. At enrolment, all participants in
each arm received puberty and hygiene training; girls in
the cups and pads arms received menstrual product-
specific training from study nurses after enrolment. Girls
attending cup-allocated schools were each provided one
menstrual cup (Mooncup (Mooncup, Brighton, UK),
size B; see online supplementary figure S1) with written
and verbal instructions on cup insertion and cleaning.
Menstrual cups are reusable bell-shaped receptacles
which collect ∼30 mL of menstrual blood when inserted
into the vaginal canal.44 Emptying is required every
4–8 hours depending on menstrual flow. Once emptied
can be immediately reinserted, with cleansing by boiling
occurring at the end of a cycle. The Mooncup used in
this study was sourced from the UK. It is made of high-
grade medical silicone which is safe, durable, and
pliable, and the material is hypoallergenic with no open
pores or edges to harbour bacteria. They are manufac-
tured in the UK to ISO 13485:2003 standards, and have
approval from the US Food and Drug Administration.
Mooncups are available for sale in Kenya, marketing at a
cost of ∼$25 each in 2012. Girls in pad-allocated schools
received 16 Always sanitary pads (2 packs per month)
and corresponding instructions. Always sanitary pads are
available in Kenya and were sourced locally in Kisumu
for ∼$1 per pack in 2012. Girls attending control
schools continued their usual practice. All girls received
hand-washing soap, and pencils for calendar comple-
tion. All schools were provided with detergent soap each
month for hand washing.

 Outcomes
The primary outcomes were school dropout, defined as
non-attendance for one term with no return to school;
and days’ absence, defined as self-reported days absent
per
100
schooldays
(excluding
weekends,
holidays,
strikes,
etc).
Prespecified
key
secondary
outcomes
included the prevalence of confirmed STIs (T. vaginalis,
C. trachomatis, and N. gonorrhoeae) and RTIs (bacterial
vaginosis and C. albicans) during the end line survey.
The main safety outcomes were the incidence of TSS
among girls provided menstrual cups, and the preva-
lence of vaginal S. aureus.
Statistical analysis
The primary analysis was in the intention-to-treat popula-
tion, defined as eligible girls receiving the intervention
per allocation group. For binary outcomes, we compared
treatment
groups
with
unadjusted
and
multivariate
log-binomial Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE)
models with the school as the cluster variable. Results
were expressed as the risk ratio and 95% CI. For con-
tinuous responses, we used unadjusted and multivariate
linear regression models using a normal distribution
and identity link functions, and expressed results as the
mean difference (95% CI). An independent covariance
structure with a robust variance estimator was used for
GEE models. Prespecified covariates included girls’ base-
line age, SES and self-reported sexual intercourse. Age
at enrolment and age at menarche were documented as
integers in years as girls did not know their dates of
birth, with the majority increasing their annual age at
each January school enrolment. Age was collapsed into
14 years and 15–16 years. SES index was calculated using
a weighted average using multiple correspondence ana-
lyses (MCA).45 MCA indicators were generated from
biennial household surveys in the HDSS, documenting
the occupation of household head, primary source of
drinking water, use of cooking fuel, in-house assets (eg,
lantern lamp, sofa, bicycle, radio and television) and
livestock
(poultry,
pigs,
donkey
cattle,
sheep
and
goats).46 The SES of households for each participant was
ranked into quintiles. This was collapsed into a dichot-
omous variable of poorest (40%) and less poor (60%).
Two absence rates were created (a) days absence per 100
viable schooldays (ie, excluding weekends, and school
closure days including holidays, school strikes, etc) and
(b) days absent during period per 100 menstruating
viable schooldays. Missing values for SES and reported
sexual intercourse were imputed. Intracluster correlation
coefficients (ICC) were calculated for primary outcomes.
To determine the effect of duration on the treatment
effect, secondary stratified analysis was conducted by the
duration that girls were enrolled in the study. This was
calculated from the date intervention provided to the
date of the outcome measured. These were then col-
lapsed into two categorical time thresholds, duration of
follow-up at least 9 months (yes/no), and duration of
follow-up for at least 12 months (yes/no). Finally, we
compared the effects of cups among girls whose cup was
observed by nurses to change colour, against those with
no colour change and against controls. Analysis was con-
ducted in SAS V.9.3 and SPSS V.22. No adjustment was
made for multiplicity.
RESULTS
Girls were enrolled from 15 August 2012 to 27 August
2013 and followed until 21 November 2013. No schools
withdrew from the study. Of 1005 girls in eligible classes,
199 (19.8%) did not fulfil the eligibility criteria, 40
(5.0%) eligible girls refused, and 15 (1.8%) migrated
prior to the start of the intervention (figure 1). Of the
remaining
751
receiving
the
intervention,
11 were
excluded from analysis having been pregnant prior to
the start of the intervention, and 96 (12.8%) were
lost-to-follow-up
(16
withdrew
and
80
migrated).
Loss-to-follow-up did not differ across groups. Girls were
followed for a median (IQR) of 10.9 (6.1–12.5) months,
66.1% for 9 m or more (see online supplementary table
S1).
Overall,
644
girls
in
30
schools
(cups=188,
pads=256, and control=200 girls) contributed to the ana-
lysis for dropout, and 502 to the STIs and RTIs analyses.
Baseline characteristics
The mean (SD) age at enrolment was 14.6 (0.7) years.
At baseline, 82.6% reported they had never used pads.
The baseline characteristics were well distributed with
the exception of the proportion of girls who reported
having
experienced
sexual
intercourse,
which
was
higher in the cups (31.7%) compared with the pads
(23.3%) and control (24.2%) arms (table 1).
Dropout
The cumulative risk of dropout by the end of follow-up
was 11.2%, 10.2%, and 8.0% in the cups, pads, and
control arms, respectively, and was mainly pregnancy-
related (see online supplementary table S2) and did not
differ significantly by arms overall (figure 2), or when
stratified by duration (figure 3). The ICC for school
dropout was 0�0084.
Absence
A total of 5971 monthly calendars were submitted as
completed by the participants during the study, with a
median of 10 (IQR 6–12) calendars completed per par-
ticipant. Self-reported school absence was very rarely
reported (0.4 [2.0] days per 100 of all [menstruating]
school days) precluding analysis.
Sexually transmitted infections
The prevalence of all STIs at the end line survey was
7.7% in the control arm versus 4.3% in the pooled cups
+pads arms (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) 0.54, 95%
CI 0.34 to 0.87, p=0.012) and 4.2% in the cups arm
(aPR=0.48, 0.24 to 0.96, p=0.04) and 4.5% in the pads
arm (aPR=0.62, 0.37 to 1.03, p=0.06) (figure 2). The

p=0.17), but not N. gonorrhoea (PR=0.91, 0.14 to 6.06,
p=0.92). Further analysis by duration since enrolment
showed the greatest impact was among girls who had
been exposed to the intervention for at least 9 months
(figure 3) or 12 months (see online supplementary
figure S2). The ICC for combined STI was 0.0191.
Reproductive tract infections
The prevalence of RTIs (bacterial vaginosis or C. albi-
cans) was 21.5%, 28.7% and 26.9% among cup, pad and
controls arms, respectively (figure 2). Bacterial vaginosis
comprised 71% of RTIs and was prevalent at 20.5% in
the control arm. This was lower (not significant) in the
cups arm (14.6%, PR=0.71, 0.47 to 1.08, p=0.11), but
not the pads arm (19.8%, PR=0.97, 0.65 to 1.44, p=0.86;
figure 2). Prevalence differences were again greatest
among girls who had received the intervention for at
least
9 months
(control=19.2%,
cups=12.9%,
pads=20.3%) (figure 3), with a significantly lower preva-
lence in the cups compared with pads and control arms
pooled
(12.9%
vs
19.8%,
PR=0.65;
0.46
to
0.93;
p=0.018). The ICC for combined RTI was 0�0031.
Outcomes among girls with no observed cup colour
change were no different from controls (see online
supplementary table S3).
Harms
No serious adverse events were observed and no TSS
cases reported (table 2). The prevalence of vaginal

 S. aureus was 9.6%, 11.2% and 11.3% in the cups, pads
and control arms, respectively (table 2).
Toxic shock
syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) was detected in 2 of 10 S.
aureus positive vaginal isolates; both were pad users and
were healthy at follow-up (table 2). E. coli was grown on
37% (13 of 35) in-use sampled cups; this was in 53% (9
of 17) cups of newer (<6 m) users, versus 22.2% (4 of
18) in cups used for 6 m or longer, with no growth
detected in six cups used for longer than 9 months.
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first interven-
tion study to compare the feasibility and potential
impact of menstrual cups and sanitary pads on school-
girls’ sexual and reproductive health and school dropout
in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Both products were asso-
ciated with a lower prevalence of STIs, C. trachomatis and
T. vaginalis in particular. Given that girls in this area of
Kenya
are
vulnerable
to
coercive
sex
to
obtain
necessities such as pads,3 4 23 24 a beneficial impact on
STIs after cup or pad provision is plausible. Menstrual
cups were also associated with lower bacterial vaginosis
prevalence among girls using them for at least 9 months.
This is likely due to the fact that cups do not disrupt the
vaginal flora or pH,33 while unhygienic cloth use has
been associated with bacterial vaginosis in Tanzanian,47
and Indian women.7 The lack of an effect of pads on
bacterial vaginosis may reflect girls obligation to share
with others, leading to prolonged use of the few pads
they retain;37 as girls reported ‘overstaying’ (using the
same pad for ∼12 hours) at baseline, causing chaffing
and soreness.3 As the normal vaginal microbiota is pro-
tective against the acquisition of STI,26–29 and HIV,30 31
menstrual cups may have the potential to reduce the
incidence of such infections in vulnerable girls and the
spread to their partners.
Menstrual cups are available throughout the world,
with numerous brands used by many millions of girls
and women, including in countries of SSA, South

verished areas is very limited, different marketing strat-
egies among the available brands are evolving including
donation of a free second cup for each cup sold.
However, while advocacy is building internationally to
support girls’ menstrual needs in school, and many
national governments are including menstrual care in
their guidance, evidence on the health and educational
benefits is required to further galvanise international
commitment and funding.2
The growth of E. coli on cups of girls in the first
6 months could pose a hygiene risk. Poor personal
hygiene, such as inadequate wiping after defaecation,
occurred among prepubescent girls with vulvovaginitis
in Turkey, with 10 different micro-organisms isolated
including E. coli.48 Girls in our cups group received

 training to boil cups after each menses, they were pro-
vided with soap, and trained to wash their hands
before cup emptying.39 However, accidental dropping
of cups occurred in the first 6 months as girls had to
learn to empty and reinsert their cup, which may have
contributed to the excess E. coli.38 It is thus recom-
mended that future menstrual cup programmes in
schools ensure high-quality training on hygiene, and
liaise with schools to advise on adequate school WASH
facilities.
This study has several limitations. We chose primary
schoolgirls to cover time of menarche and sexual debut;
however, the introduction of free primary education has
reduced the average age of girls attending primary
school,49 and many girls had not reached the median
age of sexual debut in this area (16.1 years).50 Thus,

 sexual exposure and dropout due to pregnancy or mar-
riage were lower than expected in the control arm.50
Migration occurred in 10.9% of enrolled participants,
which may have concealed undeclared pregnancies
among girls lost to follow-up,23 and may have reduced
the ability to detect dropout, but is unlikely to have
biased our findings as there was no difference in migra-
tion rates between study arms. Furthermore, as our study
was nested in a HDSS, it allowed us to visit participants’
homes to confirm cases of migration or school dropout,
and to document any pregnancies and related birth out-
comes. This approach minimised the under-reporting of
pregnancy-related dropouts due to the stigma associated
with premarital sex, although some still may have been
missed.
The study was designed as an exploratory feasibility
study to support the design of future trials and was not
powered to detect small-to-moderate differences in out-
comes between study arms, especially taking the rela-
tively short duration of follow-up into account (median
10.9 months). The study duration was compromised by a
national teachers’ strike at the start of enrolment, plus
late entry of younger girls who could only enter the
study once they reached menarche. The relatively short
intervention period was compounded by the slow initial
uptake of cups, requiring time for familiarisation before
girls used them regularly,37 as reported in a Nepalese
study.51 Our results suggest 9 or more months interven-
tion were required before potential beneficial effects
became apparent, reducing our study power as only
two-thirds of girls were followed for at least 9 months,
and half of them for more than 1 year. This short dur-
ation limited the study’s ability to detect differences in
school dropout. The rate of dropout appeared higher
during early intervention, and declined in the second
year for participants followed longer, which may reflect
that
the
most
vulnerable
girls
were
among
early
dropouts, including those at higher risk of STI. Studies
to date, predominantly using school registers, have not
shown a strong association between absence and men-
strual intervention with varying duration of follow-up
ranging between 1-month and 1-year.10 12–16 Attendance
data may be a poor measure of menstrual intervention
effectiveness in SSA where girls report multiple reasons
for absenteeism.15 The limitations of routine registration
has also been noted in school-based helminth studies.52
One menstrual cup study using a combination of school
registers and time diary data for a subset of girls was
able to ascertain that girls miss a total of 0.4 menstruat-
ing days in a 180 day school year in Nepal.14 We could
not use our calendar data to confirm or refute this;
although girls filled in the days of their menstruation,
many did not self-report absence days. Lack of quanti-
fiable
school
absence
here
and
in
other
pilot
studies,10 51 contrasts with girls’,3–5 10 and parents nar-
ratives.37 It is unclear if girls in this environment exag-
gerate missed time when in focus groups but not in
structured questionnaires,15 if girls avoid reporting
reasons
that
are
associated
with
stigma
(such
as
teenage pregnancy), fear repercussions when report-
ing absence (which we consider possible in our study),
or if menstrual absence due to abdominal cramps
or other reasons over-ride any menstrual product
effect.15 23 Further research is needed to better quan-
tify the effects of menstrual interventions on school
absence, and it seems prudent that studies validate
their
measurement
tools
in
pilot
studies
and
spot-checks.
The impact on STIs was assessed using the prevalence
of STIs at the end of the follow-up. Logistical constraints
prevented testing for STIs at baseline and any pre-
existing
differences
in
STI
prevalence
cannot
be
excluded. It is recommended that future trials evaluating
these
interventions
assess
the
incidence
of
STIs.

 Similarly, collection of baseline and end line sexual
behaviours would confirm or refute any hypothesised
intervention effect.
An important component of this study was the neces-
sity to ensure that cup users were able to use them
hygienically. Owing to the limited literature on the
potential risk of poor school hygiene on menstrual cup
safety, we selected schools based on pupil–latrine ratio,
some separate latrines for girls, and the availability of
water at the baseline spot-check. This limits the general-
isability of our study, and it is unclear if the results can
be extrapolated to schools without these conditions;
however, while these inclusion criteria were met at base-
line, observational follow-up and separate discussions
with girls revealed conditions fluctuated and schools
often did not supply soap or water.37 It is noted that con-
certed effort is underway in many countries including
Kenya to address WASH in schools, with national guide-
lines on minimal standards.53 Adequate hygiene also
required preintervention education, provision of soap
throughout the study, and presence of a nurse in the
schools. Soap was provided to all girls, to ensure a
balance between the arms. Girls in the control group
received small (non-menstrual) items, such as pencils or
a biro pen, at similar intervals to those in the other arms
for diary completion. This frequent exposure to study
nurses was appreciated by all girls, including those in
the control group, and may have positively influenced
girls’ attitude to school and attendance.
In conclusion, our feasibility study found that provi-
sion of menstrual cups and sanitary pads for ∼1 school-
year was not associated with a significant effect on
school dropout, but was associated with a lower risk of
STIs in schoolgirls in western Kenya. We hypothesise this
is due to reducing the need for transactional sex to
obtain menstrual products. These results are relevant to
other areas with similar high frequency of transactional
coerced sex among adolescent girls. Our study also sug-
gests that cup use may be associated with less bacterial
vaginosis, which is common in SSA and a known risk
factor for STIs and HIV acquisition and transmission.
Menstrual cups are safe to use and well accepted after a
familiarisation phase,37 are approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration, and can be reused for up to
10 years, and so are more cost-effective than pads. This
was a pilot study and the findings now need to be con-
firmed in a larger trial with longer follow-up among sec-
ondary schoolgirls, who are vulnerable to sexual coercion
and pregnancy-related dropout.23 Metagenomic studies
evaluating the effect of menstrual cups on the vaginal
microbiome and subsequent potential effect on STI, HIV
transmission, and maternal health are also recommended.
