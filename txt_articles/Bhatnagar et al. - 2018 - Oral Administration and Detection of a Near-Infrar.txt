ABSTRACT: Molecular imaging is advantageous for screening diseases
such as breast cancer by providing precise spatial information on disease-
associated biomarkers, something neither blood tests nor anatomical
imaging can achieve. However, the high cost and risks of ionizing
radiation for several molecular imaging modalities have prevented a
feasible and scalable approach for screening. Clinical studies have
demonstrated the ability to detect breast tumors using nonspecific probes
such as indocyanine green, but the lack of molecular information and
required intravenous contrast agent does not provide a significant benefit
over current noninvasive imaging techniques. Here we demonstrate that
negatively charged sulfate groups, commonly used to improve solubility
of near-infrared fluorophores, enable sufficient oral absorption and
targeting of fluorescent molecular imaging agents for completely
noninvasive detection of diseased tissue such as breast cancer. These
functional groups improve the pharmacokinetic properties of affinity ligands to achieve targeting efficiencies compatible with
clinical imaging devices using safe, nonionizing radiation (near-infrared light). Together, this enables development of a “disease
screening pill” capable of oral absorption and systemic availability, target binding, background clearance, and imaging at clinically
relevant depths for breast cancer screening. This approach should be adaptable to other molecular targets and diseases for use as
a new class of screening agents.

■ INTRODUCTION
Molecular imaging has significant potential for disease screen-
ing applications by providing both spatial and molecular
information to the physician, but so far, a feasible approach has
not been developed. The route of administration of a molecular
imaging agent for screening large portions of the population is
critical for developing a scalable approach. Oral delivery
provides several advantages over other avenues of admin-
istration that can be grouped into three main categories: safety,
cost, and compliance. Oral delivery is generally the safest route
of administration1 and can avoid the low risk of anaphylactic
shock (e.g., 0.05−0.2% for indocyanine green (ICG)).2 The
cost of intravenous (IV) administration is generally higher
given the requirement for sterile delivery and medical
personnel. For compliance, patients strongly prefer subcuta-
neous (SC) delivery to IV (91.5%3) and oral delivery to SC
injection (93%4), and self-administration would avoid extended
or multiple visits for IV delivery and imaging.
One major reason why oral administration of molecular
imaging agents has never been previously reported, to our
knowledge, is the disparate physicochemical properties required
for oral absorption versus efficient targeting. High oral
bioavailability for drug-like compounds generally requires
low-molecular-weight (<500 Da) and high lipophilicity.5 In
contrast, efficient targeting agents often favor higher molecular
weights for specific binding and low lipophilicity to reduce off-
target interactions. Hydrophilic molecules are generally poorly
absorbed, and negatively charged drugs have even worse oral
absorption (Figure S1). For example, the FDA approved drug,
alendronate, has only 0.7% oral bioavailability in humans (0.2%
in mice) despite its small size of 250 Da.6 It is unexpected that a
highly charged molecule greater than 1000 Da would have
sufficient oral absorption into the bloodstream, and even if it
did, the pharmacokinetics following oral delivery are much
different than the pharmacokinetics following IV infusion of
molecular imaging agents. To be successful, orally delivered
molecular imaging agents require a balance of properties

 including absorption (stability in the gut, intestinal absorption,
low first-pass extraction in the liver), efficient targeting, and
compatible optical properties for detection at clinical depths
(Figure 1, Table S2).
Despite these challenges for oral delivery of molecular
imaging agents, we hypothesized that sufficient targeting could
be achieved with appropriately balanced physicochemical
properties. The initial design criteria for selecting the targeting
ligand are listed in Table S2. We selected a low-molecular-
weight targeting ligand against integrin (αvβ3) receptors. This
extracellular target has high expression on several cell types
(e.g., in cancer-activated endothelium, macrophages, and tumor
cells) for robust expression. Importantly, the target internalizes
with a sufficient rate for probe trapping over extended periods
of time. This target also has a series of affinity ligands
developed against it for therapeutic purposes that have been
optimized by medicinal chemists for stability in the GI tract,
low first-pass metabolism, moderate plasma protein binding,
and low toxicity.7−11 The selected ligand maintains targeting
following conjugation to several fluorophores,12 allowing us to
manipulate the physicochemical properties with the fluoro-
phore for mechanistic studies.13,14
Breast cancer screening is one application where molecular
imaging could be beneficial. Cancer therapy has been rapidly
advancing toward molecular characterization, but screening
technology generally relies on anatomical differences that have
several limitations.15 These include the lack of molecular
information to identify aggressive tumors versus those that pose
no mortality risk (overdiagnosed tumors)16,17 and the lack of
contrast in dense breast tissue that carries increased risk,
particularly prevalent in younger women.18,19 These limitations
have led to an estimated $4 billion being overspent on false-
positives and overdiagnosis.20 Near-infrared fluorescence
imaging has been investigated as a method to improve
sensitivity and specificity,21,22 and current scanners are capable
of imaging tumors less than 2 cm in diameter that are
imbedded deep in breast tissue at the contrast levels reported
here following oral delivery.23,24
■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Imaging Agent Synthesis. The agents were generated
similar to previous reports.13 Briefly, the targeting ligand
(ChemPartner, Waltham, MA), synthesized as an ester, was
resuspended in DMSO at a concentration of 300 mg/mL. The
ester group on the integrin binder was hydrolyzed to a
carboxylic acid by mixing it with 150 μL of ethanol and 7 μL of
1 M NaOH per mg of drug with continuous stirring overnight.
This mixture was then neutralized with 1 M HCl, and the
solvents were evaporated. IRDye 800CW was obtained from
LI-COR (Lincoln, NE)), Alexa Fluor 680 (AF680), BODIPY
650/665-X (BODIPY 650), and CellTrace Far Red DDAO
(DDAO) were obtained from Life Technologies (Carlsbad,
CA), and Sulfo-Cyanine7 (Sulfo-Cy7) was obtained from
Lumiprobe (Hallandale Beach, FL) in the NHS ester form. The
hydrolyzed integrin binder was reacted with the fluorescent
dyes in a 1:1.5 molar ratio in the presence of 2 μL of
triethylamine per mg of drug. The reaction was run overnight
and purified using a preparative scale Luna C18(2) column
(Phenomenex; Torrance, CA) on a Shimadzu reverse phase
HPLC. Full purification methods are provided in the

of these agents (254 nm) were measured on HPLC
(IRDye800CW agent: 95% (99.9% fluorescence purity);
AF680 agent: 96.5%; Sulfo-cyanine7 agent: 88% (99.4%

Cell Lines. All reagents mentioned below were obtained
from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA) unless specified
otherwise. MDA-MB-231 and HEK-293 cells were purchased
from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown in DMEM with 10%
FBS and 1% penicillin−streptomycin (supplemented with 1%
L-Glutamine for MDA-MB-231). HEK-293 cells, which express
endogenous αv but not β3
25 were transfected with the β3
integrin subunit (Addgene plasmid 27289) to generate an αvβ3
positive line. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and selected with 1
mg/mL G418 in the media.
Characterization (logD, PPB, Affinity). The binding
affinity of all agents was measured using the transfected
HEK-293 cells. The cells were harvested and incubated in
triplicate with varying concentrations of the agents in
suspension for 3 h on ice. The cells were washed with PBS
and run on an Attune acoustic focusing cytometer to quantify
the fluorescence. Dissociation constants for each of the agents
were determined by analyzing the data on Prism (GraphPad
Software; La Jolla, CA). The large amount of nonspecific signal
generated from receptor-negative cells for the lipophilic
BODIPY-650 agent was subtracted from the receptor positive
cell line signal for an accurate measurement of the specific
receptor dissociation constant.
Transfected and untransfected HEK-293 cells were plated on
chamber slides and allowed to attach overnight. The cells were
incubated with either 10 nM of the agent (IRDye 800CW and
AF 680) or 50 nM (BODIPY 650, DDAO, and Sulfo-Cy7) for
25 min at 37 °C and washed with fresh media. The cells were
then imaged on an Olympus FV1200 confocal microscope
using the 405, 635, and 748 nm lasers. These cells were also run
on an Attune acoustic focusing cytometer to obtain quantitative
data. For the blocked samples, the transfected cells were
preblocked with either 1 μM (IRDye 800CW and AF 680) or 5
μM (BODIPY 650, DDAO, and Sulfo-Cy7) of the uncon-
jugated integrin binder for 25 min at 37 °C. The cells were then
washed and resuspended in either 10 nM of the agent (IRDye
800CW and AF 680) or 50 nM (BODIPY 650, DDAO, and
Sulfo-Cy7) in the presence of 100-fold higher unconjugated
integrin binder.
Plasma protein binding (PPB) of the agents was measured
using a Rapid Equilibrium Dialysis (Thermo Scientific;
Rockford, IL) plate according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Mouse plasma (Innovative Research; Novi, MI; Cat. No.
C57BL6) was mixed with 1 μM of the agents. After
equilibration, the buffer in each chamber was adjusted to 50%
mouse plasma in PBS to eliminate the effects of protein binding
on fluorescence. The signal was measured using an Odyssey
CLx (LI-COR; Lincoln, NE).
The logD7.4 for all the agents was measured using a protocol
adapted from Miller et al.26 The agents were prepared at a
concentration of 5−50 μM in octanol-saturated phosphate
buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). A volume of 200 μL of this
solution was mixed with 200 μL of PBS-saturated octanol. The
mixture was stirred at 700 rpm for 24 h. For lipophilic agents,
the aqueous phase concentration was directly measured using
fluorescence with the mass balance yielding the logD.
Hydrophilic compounds with minimal loss in the aqueous
phase were measured using a second extraction step. After the
first equilibration, 150 μL of the octanol was mixed with 50 μL
of fresh octanol-saturated PBS to extract the agent in the
octanol phase and measure the aqueous fluorescence. During
the fluorescence read-out, the samples and calibration curves
were diluted in 0.5% PBS−BSA to minimize precipitation and
sticking to the vessel surface.
In Vivo Oral Absorption and Imaging. C57BL/6 female
mice (8 weeks old, n = 3−4 per cohort) were used to measure
the oral absorption of the imaging agents. All experiments
involving mice were conducted in compliance with the
University of Michigan University Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC). The mice were dosed with 1
mg/kg of the imaging agent via oral gavage and placed in a
metabolic cage for a period of 24 h. Urine was collected from
these cages at the end of 24 h. The urine was diluted 10-fold in
0.1% PBS−BSA to prevent the agent from sticking to vessel
surfaces. This was then measured on an Odyssey CLx to
determine the amount of fluorescent agent present in the urine.
This was quantified using a calibration curve of each agent.
MDA MB 231 cells were used for tumor xenografts in female
nude mice of 6−8 weeks of age (Jackson Laboratory; Bar
Harbor, ME). The cells were harvested using trypsin−EDTA
(0.05%) and resuspended in Matrigel (Corning; Corning, NY)
at a concentration of 5 000 000 cells/50 μL. Mice were
anesthetized using isoflurane at 2% and 1 L/min oxygen, and
the cells were injected subcutaneously by the first nipple in the
mammary fat pad to avoid fluorescence signal from the gut
when imaging. The mice were dosed with the imaging agent
once the longest axis of the tumor reached 7−10 mm. Tumor-
bearing mice were fed AIN-93 M nonfluorescent chow (Harlan;
Indianapolis, IN; Cat. No. TD.94048) for 2 weeks before oral
gavage. Mice (n = 3 per cohort) were imaged on an IVIS
Spectrum (PerkinElmer; Waltham, MA) at 6, 24, and 48 h after
administration of 5 mg/kg of the agent, and the LivingImage
software (PerkinElmer; Waltham,MA) was used to measure the
signal intensity in the tumor and TBR. The biodistribution
protocol is adapted from Oliviera et al.27 In short, the mice
were euthanized at 48 h post administration, and all of their
organs were resected. The organs (part of the tumor was frozen
in OCT for histology slides) were minced with a razor blade
and weighed. They were placed in Eppendorf tubes and
digested using a collagenase (Worthington Biochemical;
Lakewood, NJ; Cat. No. CLS-4) solution (5 mg/mL) in
RIPA buffer (Boston BioProducts; Ashland, MA) at 37 °C for
20 min. The organs were sonicated, digested for 30 min at 37
°C using a 50:50 trypsin and RIPA buffer solution, and
sonicated again. The resulting mixture was plated in a dilution
series in a black walled 96-well plate and imaged using the
Odyssey CLx. Absolute quantification was obtained by
comparison with a calibration curve. The uptake values were
normalized to the average amount of agent that reached the
systemic circulation (absorbed dose) per gram of tissue (versus
injected dose per gram (%ID/g) used for intravenous delivery).

 Histology. Frozen blocks of the tumor in OCT were
sectioned into 14 μm slices on a cryostat. The slices were first
imaged on the Odyssey CLx in the presence of PBS to prevent
the tissue from drying out. This slice was then stained ex vivo
with Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Cat.
No.H3570), the AF680 agent (due to its higher affinity),
anti-Mac3 antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA: Cat. No.
553322) labeled Alexa Fluor555, and anti-CD31 (BioLegends,
San Diego, CA; Cat. No. 102402) labeled Alexa Fluor 488.
These slides were then washed in PBS and imaged on an
Olympus FV1200 confocal microscope equipped with 405, 488,
543, 633, and 748 nm laser lines.
The integrin image in Figure 4 was post processed to remove
stitching artifacts (Figure S2). We used the ImageJ FFT
bandpass filter, suppressing horizontal and vertical lines with a
cutoff of 2500 pixels and 0 pixels with a 5% tolerance.

 agent, with lipophilicity most similar to higher-molecular-
weight oral therapeutics such as cyclosporine A (logP = 2.92,28
oral bioavailability = 30%29), resulted in high nonspecific
sticking to antigen-negative and blocked cells (Figure 2C). The
fluorophore on the lowest-molecular-weight compound,
DDAO, has a pKa of 5, resulting in intracellular fluorescence
quenching following internalization, which is an important
mechanism for long-term retention. In contrast, the sulfated
cyanine dyes (IRDye800CW, AF680, and Sulfo-Cy7) had
excellent targeting specificity and showed high oral absorption
given their size and charge (Figure 2D). Although the Alexa
Fluor 680 agent had higher affinity, the IRDye800CW agent
was selected for studies in the orthotopic breast cancer model
due to its higher oral absorption and ideal optical properties
(lower background autofluorescence and higher penetration in
tissue than 680 nm dyes).30
High Uptake and Specificity of Imaging Agent in
Breast Cancer. Figure 3 shows images of the orthotopic
xenograft model of breast cancer at 6, 24, and 48 h post
administration of the IRDye800CW agent. The tumors had
significant uptake by 6 h, and the intestinal signal cleared at the
later time points to yield high contrast by 24 and 48 h (tumor
to background ratios of ∼4 at 48 h). The image intensity shows
that the amount of agent in the tumor stays relatively constant
over a period of 48 h owing to the residualizing nature of the
NIR fluorophore.31 To demonstrate specificity, we used a low-
affinity stereoisomer of the IRDye800CW agent, since the two
most common techniques, blocking specific uptake or using an
antigen-negative tumor, were not feasible. Complete blocking
of the targeting receptor over the course of several hours while
the agent is absorbed orally would require an impractical
amount of the rapidly cleared nonfluorescent ligand, and
antigen-negative xenografts still express integrins on the
neovasculature and macrophages. The plasma signals were
similar between the stereoisomers (Figure S5), but the whole
animal fluorescence intensity and biodistribution showed
dramatically lower uptake for the low-affinity stereoisomer in
all organs (Figure 3). Integrins are expressed at high levels on
breast cancer cells, tumor-associated macrophages, and neo-
vasculature relative to healthy tissue, providing robust detection
by diversifying the cellular targets (Table S3). The rapid tumor
penetration of this low-molecular-weight compound and
intermixed cell types in this model32 resulted in relatively
uniform signal throughout the tumor with potentially higher
uptake by tumor-associated macrophages (Figure 4).
■ DISCUSSION
Orally delivered molecular imaging agents have the promise to
provide spatial and molecular information to a physician using a
method less invasive than a blood test. Near-infrared
fluorescence imaging is intrinsically less expensive than other
modalities, such as nuclear imaging and MRI, due to the
comparatively lower costs of the imaging equipment and
molecular imaging agents with the main limitation being the
depth of imaging. Since this system employs near-infrared
imaging, the light scattering and absorption limits applications
to several millimeters for epifluorescence imaging or several
centimeters (e.g., through the human breast) using tomog-
raphy.
We selected integrin (αvβ3) targeting agents as a model
system due to their physicochemical properties, safety even at
large doses,33 and the importance of integrin expression in
breast cancer detection. Many integrin-targeted imaging agents
are currently being investigated in clinical trials.34 Women with
dense breast tissue, which makes detection particularly difficult
using mammography, have a markedly increased risk for
invasive breast cancer35 and have a higher risk of dying from
their cancer.36 Because the detection reported here is based on
a molecularly targeted agent with fluorescence and not tissue
density differences, the sensitivity and specificity is not expected
to be highly dependent on breast tissue density37 like it is for
nonspecific NIR probes.38 This benefit has been demonstrated
with radiolabeled integrin targeting agents in the clinic.39 The
high level of integrin expression on multiple distinct cell types,
including stromal tissue, is advantageous for early screening for
robust detection sensitivity and the decreased risk of saturating
the target, which would reduce contrast. The optimal 800 nm
imaging channel and high target expression provide a large
window for achieving efficient contrast even with significant
variability in absorption since both signal and background
intensity vary in tandem resulting in relatively constant
contrast. In addition to detection sensitivity, molecular imaging
agents have the potential to better differentiate aggressive
lesions versus benign conditions and reduce the rate of
overdiagnosis through better detection of at-risk tumors. This is
particularly poignant as analyses of large data sets indicate that
the current use of mammography is overdiagnosing and
treating women.40,41
We hypothesized that balanced physicochemical properties
could help achieve high contrast following oral delivery of a
near-infrared fluorescent molecular imaging agent. Results from
this study demonstrated that molecules can overcome the
significant physical and kinetic barriers for sufficient oral
delivery and targeting of molecular imaging agents in living
subjects. Hydrophilic molecules, particularly anionic drugs, have
low oral bioavailability and high patient-to-patient variability in
oral absorption. However, several polyanionic molecules,
including heparins and chondroitin sulfate, have shown
measurable absorption following oral delivery in animals and
the clinic.42−44 Because of the variability in absorption and
rapid renal excretion, a metabolic cage was used to collect urine
to estimate absorption and avoid interpolation errors from
measure plasma concentrations. HPLC and mass spectrometry
verified excretion of the intact probe following oral gavage
(Figure S3).
Besides total oral absorption, there are significant hurdles in
imaging agent targeting due to the slower absorption rate
following oral delivery compared to intravenous injection. Due
to rapid plasma clearance following oral absorption, a
dissociation rate of days at 37 °C would be required to
maintain significant signal until the agent is fully absorbed and
cleared from background tissue. However, the anionic charge
on the internalizing agents in this study can aid in trapping the
dye within cells for days.31 Despite the long time period
between oral administration and imaging, this would still be
favorable from a patient compliance standpoint, since intra-
venous delivery of low-molecular-weight agents requires a
minimum of hours to develop contrast. This would necessitate
extended or multiple clinical visitsthe first to receive an
intravenous dose and monitoring for adverse reactions followed
by an imaging visit several hours to days later. While this may
not be an impediment for life-saving surgery with intraoperative
imaging,45 it could have a major impact on patient compliance
in screening large healthy populations. Because material costs
for small molecules are often low (e.g., $1 per dose for small
molecule drugs46), the associated costs of medical personnel

1751
 and sterile intravenous delivery would likely be higher than any
cost savings from improved bioavailability from more invasive
routes.
Plasma protein binding mediated by the high anionic charge
also plays a role in enabling orally delivered molecular imaging
agents. In the current approach, contrary to radiolabeled
probes,13 some plasma protein binding is beneficial by slowing
clearance relative to absorption, increasing the plasma
concentration, and improving target signal relative to back-
ground autofluorescence. The plasma concentrations were
similar between the low- and high-affinity stereoisomers
(Figure S5), indicating similar absorption, protein binding,
and clearance. However, the biodistribution values were
significantly higher in all the organs (and tumor) for the
high-affinity stereoisomer (Figure 3), indicative of binding to
integrins within the tumor and healthy tissue. While healthy
tissue uptake lowers the absolute contrast between the target
and background tissue, it can actually reduce variation in tumor
contrast. If the background signal originated solely from a
constant level of tissue autofluorescence, variable oral
absorption would result in large changes in measured target
to background ratios (TBR). However, when the background
signal is from absorbed probe, both the target and background
signal are proportional to absorbed dose, resulting in a more
constant TBR.
There are several current limitations and areas for improve-
ment with this approach. First, the 2.5% absorbed dose results
in variability between mice. While this variability does not
impact the contrast significantly, since both tumor signal and
background are approximately linear with absorbed dose, mice
at the very low end of the optical absorption profile risk having
autofluorescence lower the contrast to noise ratio. Improved
formulation could increase the oral absorption and lower the
variability, thereby reducing the dose needed. Second, clinical
trials with intravenously delivered (nonspecific) contrast agents
have highlighted the difficulty in imaging tumors in the breast
near the chest wall (similar to mammography). Improvements
in alternative detection methods, such as optoacoustic imaging,
may provide better detection in this region. Extensive work has
been conducted in NIR tomographic imaging of the breast, but
in general, NIR fluorescence is suitable for diseases in
superficial tissues (e.g., within several millimeters of the surface
for planar epifluorescence imaging47). Finally, although the
current agent provides molecular information, which is an
improvement over anatomical images, a single biomarker will
not be able to differentiate all tumor types. Additional
biomarkers, e.g., from dual-channel imaging at a second NIR
wavelength with a different agent, could significantly increase
the diagnostic specificity. The use of negatively charged agents
should be adaptable to other small molecule targeting ligands
against different extracellular markers.
In conclusion, the high negative charge density on the agent
enabled sufficient oral absorption, reduced nonspecific internal-
ization, facilitated targeting by extending the clearance half-life,
and increased retention through cellular trapping to yield
efficient targeting contrast in a small animal model of breast
cancer for detection at clinically relevant depths. To our
knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a disease screening
approach using oral administration of a molecular imaging
agent, and these mechanisms should be applicable to additional
agents and disease targets for developing a series of molecular
imaging agents for noninvasive screening.
