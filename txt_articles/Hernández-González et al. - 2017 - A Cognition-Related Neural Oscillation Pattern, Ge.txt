The prelimbic (PrL) cortex constitutes one of the highest levels of cortical hierarchy dedicated to the execution of adaptive behaviors. We
have identified a specific local field potential (LFP) pattern generated in the PrL cortex and associated with cognition-related behaviors.
We used this pattern to trigger the activation of a visual display on a touch screen as part of an operant conditioning task. Rats learned to
increase the presentation rate of the selected � to �–� (�/�-�) transition pattern across training sessions. The selected LFP pattern
appeared to coincide with a significant decrease in the firing of PrL pyramidal neurons and did not seem to propagate to other cortical or
subcortical areas. An indication of the PrL cortex’s cognitive nature is that the experimental disruption of this �/�-� transition pattern
prevented the proper performance of the acquired task without affecting the generation of other motor responses. The use of this LFP

be a useful tool to activate the presentation of external cues or to modify the current circumstances.

Introduction
The use of the neural cortical activity for operant conditioning
tasks goes back to the 1970s, with the innovative approaches of
Fetz and colleagues (Fetz, 1969; Fetz and Finocchio, 1971, 1972).
Fetz’s group used awake monkeys to demonstrate the condition-
ing of single neurons by reinforcing a high rate of neuronal activ-
ity with the delivery of a reward. Latterly, it was also shown that
the information contained in local field potentials (LFPs) pos-
sesses features suited (Pesaran et al., 2002; Mehring et al., 2003)
for use as brain–machine interfaces (BMIs; Flint et al., 2013; So et
al., 2014). LFPs are more stable than unitary recordings and present
higher spatial resolution and signal amplitudes than electroenceph-
alographic recordings (Freeman et al., 2003; Shain et al., 2003).
Many studies have used the neural activity recorded in the M1
and/or the posterior parietal cortices for different experimental
designs, including the activation of external devices (Lebedev and
Nicolelis, 2006; Bouton et al., 2016). But, in the past few years, the
appearance of noninvasive techniques has allowed the use of deep
brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, for BMIs controlled
by cognitive activities (Schudlo et al., 2013; Hong et al., 2015).
BMIs have been largely explored from the point of view of inter-

Significance Statement
Brain–machine interfaces represent a solution for physically impaired people to communicate with external devices. We have
identifiedaspecificlocalfieldpotentialpatterngeneratedintheprelimbiccortexandassociatedwithgoal-directedbehaviors.We
used the pattern to trigger the activation of a visual display on a touch screen as part of an operant conditioning task. Rats learned
toincreasethepresentationrateoftheselectedfieldpotentialpatternacrosstraining.Theselectedpatternwasnotmodifiedwhen
used to activate the touch screen. Electrical stimulation of the recording site prevented the proper performance of the task. Our
findings show that the prelimbic cortex can generate oscillatory patterns that rats can use to control their environment for
achieving specific goals.

 face design, including algorithms, motor imagery, and adapted
electronic devices, but rarely from an electrophysiological ap-
proach, specifically a learning process where two events—a spe-
cific cortical activity pattern and a subsequent response generated
in an external device—are progressively associated. In this re-
gard, recent papers have been focused on the study of neural
mechanisms underlying motor and cognitive processes using
these sorts of interfaces (Koralek et al., 2012; Rouse et al., 2013;
Wander et al., 2013). These types of study could help identify
some of the physiological processes related to the actual motor
and cognitive learning tasks (O’Doherty et al., 2011; Schafer and
Moore, 2011; Hiremath et al., 2015).
Although they present many experimental (extended labora-
tory use, adequate brain size, easy acquisition of operant condi-
tion tasks) and ethical advantages, rats have not often been used
in studies related to BMIs. In our approach, we have used a well
defined LFP [a � to �–� (�/�-�)] transition pattern recorded at
the rostral prelimbic (PrL) cortex of rats to trigger the presenta-
tion of a visual display on an iPad tablet. The rat was rewarded
with a pellet of food when touching the iPad screen. This operant
conditioning design has the advantage of using a LFP pattern
generated in a brain area not directly related to motor control
commands (Khanna and Carmena, 2015), but to volitional and
valuation processes (Kable and Glimcher, 2009; Graybeal et al.,
2011; Fuster, 2015). We also studied the putative changes in the
profiles of the LFPs used to activate the touch screen as well as the
firing activities of putative PrL pyramidal cells to determine their
contribution to the generation of the selected LFP pattern. In
addition, we checked the cognitive nature of the selected LFP
pattern by determining the animal’s behavior associated with it
and the behavioral effects of PrL cortex stimulation during the
pattern’s spontaneous appearances. In this regard, it has been
recently described that the electrical stimulation of the PrL cortex
recording sites prevent the proper performance of acquired op-
erant conditioning tasks (Jurado-Parras et al., 2012). In sum-
mary, present results indicate that PrL cortex circuits seem to
evoke specific oscillatory patterns probably related to attentional
and cognitive processes that can be safely used to trigger external
cues and/or to deal with specific environmental constrains.
Materials and Methods
Experimental animals. Experiments were performed on male Lister
hooded rats (5–6 months old) provided by an authorized supplier
(Charles River Laboratories). Upon arrival at the Pablo de Olavide Ani-
mal House (Seville, Spain), animals were housed in individual cages until
the end of the experiment. Rats were kept on a 12 h light/dark cycle with
constant ambient temperature (21.5 � 1°C) and humidity (55 � 8%),
with food and water available ad libitum. All experiments were per-
formed in accordance with the guidelines of the European Union Coun-
cil (2010/276:33-79/EU) and Spanish regulations (BOE 34:11370-421,
2013) for the use of laboratory animals in chronic studies, and approved
by the local Ethics Committee of the Pablo de Olavide University.
Surgery. Animals were anesthetized with 1–2.5% isoflurane delivered
by a rat anesthesia mask (David Kopf Instruments). The anesthetic gas
was supplied from a calibrated Fluotec 5 (Fluotec-Ohmeda) vaporizer, at
a flow rate of 1–3 l/min oxygen (AstraZeneca). For LFP recordings (Fig.
1B,C), and following the Paxinos and Watson atlas (1998; RRID:
SCR_006369), animals (n � 10) were chronically implanted with record-
ing electrodes aimed at the PrL cortex (2.7 mm anterior to bregma, 0.8
mm lateral to bregma, and 3.6 mm below the brain surface), the nucleus
accumbens (1.7 mm anterior to bregma, 1.4 mm lateral to bregma, and
7.6 mm below the brain surface), the primary motor cortex (1.0 mm
anterior to bregma, 2.3 mm lateral to bregma, and 2.0 mm below the
brain surface), the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (3.0 mm posterior to

 bregma, 0.5 mm lateral to bregma, and 5.3 mm below the brain surface),
the hippocampal CA1 area (3.8 mm posterior to bregma, 2.0 mm lateral
to bregma, and 2.5 mm below the brain surface), and the ventral tegmen-
tal area (6.0 mm posterior to bregma, 0.5 mm lateral to bregma, and 7.8
mm below the brain surface). These electrodes were made from 50 �m,
Teflon-coated, tungsten wire (Advent Research). Each electrode con-
sisted of three individual tungsten wires with their tips spaced 300 �m
apart along the extent of the electrode. With the aim of recording the
unitary activity present in the PrL cortex during the appearance of the
selected �/�-� transition pattern, five additional animals were implanted
in the PrL cortex with the same recording electrode but with the addition
of a home-made multielectrode. The multielectrode was composed of six
25 �m, Teflon-coated, tungsten wires (Advent Research).
To determine whether vibrissal movements were related to LFPs re-
corded at the PrL cortex, a pair of recording electrodes was implanted in
the center of the contralateral whisker pad in the above-mentioned ani-
mals. Vibrissal electrodes were made from 50 �m, Teflon-coated, an-
nealed stainless steel wire (A-M Systems). A bare silver wire was affixed to
the bone as ground. All the implanted wires were soldered to three six-
pin sockets (RS Amidata) and fixed to the skull with dental cement
(Fig. 1; Gruart et al., 2006).
Since the presence of recording wires could represent a significant
impairment for the proper acquisition of the pattern-triggered tasks, an
additional group (n � 5) of rats were chronically implanted with five 50
�m tungsten recording electrodes aimed at the PrL cortex. These elec-
trodes, plus a ground wire, were connected to a Bakelite integrated circuit
(Cibertec) equipped with an eight-pin Omnetics socket (RS Amidata).
Recording and stimulating procedures. LFP and electromyographic re-
cordings were performed using Grass P511 differential amplifiers with a
bandwidth of 0.1–10 kHz (Grass-Telefactor). Wireless recordings were
performed with the help of a five-channel TBSI head-stage system (Harvard
Bioscience). Unitary recordings were performed with high-impedance
probes (2 � 1012 �, 10 pF) and filtered between 450 and 4500 Hz, with the
help of a finite impulse response filter.
For the electrical stimulation of the PrL cortex region during operant
conditioning, we used a 200 Hz train of pulses (50 �s negative–positive)
lasting 200 ms. The train was triggered, with a delay of �0.5 ms, by a
touch of a square virtual button on the iPad screen. To avoid excessive
stimulations of the experimental animal, subsequent iPad touches within
a 6 s window did not trigger any stimulus. Stimulus intensities ranged
from 0.5 to 1 mA. For each animal, we selected the minimum intensity
evoking a short disruption in the expected behavioral sequence (touch the
visual display, go to the feeder, eat the pellet; Jurado-Parras et al., 2012).
Instrumental conditioning. In a preliminary series of experiments, a
group of rats (n � 5) were trained for operant conditioning in a basic
Skinner box module measuring 29.2 � 24.1 � 21 cm (MED Associates).
The operant chamber was housed within a sound-attenuating chamber
(90 � 55 � 60 cm), which was constantly illuminated (19 W lamp) and
exposed to a 45 dB of white noise (Cibertec). The Skinner box was
equipped with a food dispenser from which pellets (Noyes formula P; 45
mg; Sandown Scientific) could be delivered by pressing a lever. Before
training, rats were handled daily for �7 d and food-deprived to 80–85%
of their ad libitum feeding weight. Once the desired weight was reached,
animals were placed in the Skinner box for 20 min and allowed to press
the lever to receive pellets from the food tray using a fixed-ratio (FR 1:1)
schedule, until reaching criterion. Criterion was to press the lever �80
times/session for 2 consecutive days (Fig. 2; Hasan et al., 2013). Another
group of rats (n � 5) were trained in a modified Skinner box module of
similar dimensions (MED Associates) equipped with an iPad tablet com-
puter and the same food dispenser from which pellets could be delivered
by touching a square (200 � 200 pixels; i.e., �3.4 � 3.4 cm) virtual
button displayed on the screen. In this case, rats were pretreated and
trained as indicated above. Collected results of this comparative study are
illustrated in Figure 2B,C.
Conditioning programs, LFP pattern detections, lever presses, screen
touches, and delivered reinforcements were monitored and recorded
with a computer, using a MED-PC program (MED Associates; RRID:
SCR_012156). All operant sessions were recorded with a video capture
system (Sony HDR-SR12E) synchronized to LFP recordings.
Activation of the touch screen by LFPs recorded in the PrL cortex. In the
next experiments, rats implanted with recording electrodes were trained
to activate the visual display on the touch screen by LFP patterns re-
corded from the PrL cortex. For this, a capacitive multitouch-screen
device (iPad 2, Apple) with a 9.7 inch LED-back-lit glossy widescreen
display with in-plane switching technology (Leising et al., 2013) was
used. It had 1024 � 768-pixel resolution at 132 pixels per inch.
First, rats were trained to touch the square virtual button in the mod-
ified Skinner box until reaching the above-specified criterion. Then, they
had to learn to trigger the appearance of the square button on the touch
screen by the generation of a �/�-� transition pattern. This LFP pattern
was identified in previous recordings of PrL cortex activities as being
related to the presentation of behaviors, such as remaining still (motion-
less) in the cage, observing the feeder, or rearing (Figs. 3, 4). This specific
LFP pattern was characterized by a significant decrease in power in the �
band (Fig. 3A,B) accompanied by smaller changes in the power of both �
and � bands (Fig. 3E). The detection of this �/�-� transition pattern was
based on the instantaneous calculation of the power in a wide band of
frequencies between 3 and 150 Hz that included the three mentioned
oscillation bands (�, �, and �). This spectral analysis was performed with
the help of a home-made program implemented with Spike2 software
(CED 1401 Plus, Cambridge Electronics Design, RRID:SCR_000903).
Power was calculated using the fast Fourier transform with a raised co-
sine window. In addition to the above, a spectral power threshold was
calculated from LFPs recorded during preliminary baseline and training
sessions and maintained during the whole experiment. According to the
intrinsic characteristics of the LFP recordings from each experimental
rat, the criterion values assigned to the threshold ranged from 0.00125 to
0.00215 V 2. Thresholds were calculated as the average of the minimum
values of power between 3 and 150 Hz plus 3 � SD. The detections of the
selected �/�-� transition pattern generated a new event channel in
Spike2, which was translated into a command system to display the visual
stimulus on the touch screen (Fig. 5A).
For the command system, we developed an ad hoc software (RatBut-
ton 2.1.3. for iOS 8.4) for stimulus presentation on the touch screen
triggered by the selected �/�-� transition pattern. The RatButton system
was activated when power for the three bands fell below the established
power threshold. The same software also activated the feeder to supply
the reward and quantify the number and time of correct screen touches.
The RatButton software was developed with X-Code in object-oriented
programming language Objective-C. Stimulus color (sRGB IEC61966-
2.1: 0, 240, 100—a green square) and luminance (150 cd/m 2 at 20 cm
distance) were adapted to rats’ vision with the help of a colorimeter
(Minolta Chroma Meter xy-1, Minolta Camera) and a photometer
(Sekonic DualMaster L-558/L; Sekonic; Jacobs et al., 2001).
Electrical stimulation of the PrL cortex. To determine whether the PrL
area—from which the selected �/�-� transition pattern was recorded—
was related to cognitive processes involved in the operant conditioning
paradigm, we checked the effects of its electrical stimulation on the on-
going behavioral sequence of touching the iPad and going to collect the
rewarded pellet. The PrL cortex was stimulated at the precise moment of
each correct touch on the screen.
Histology. At the end of the experiments, rats were deeply reanesthe-
tized with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and medetomidine (0.1
mg/kg) and perfused transcardially with saline and 4% paraformalde-
hyde in PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4). Brains were cryoprotected with 30% sucrose
in PB, and coronal sections (50 �m) were obtained with a sliding freezing
microtome (Leica, SM2000R) and stored at �20°C in 30% glycerol and
30% ethylene glycol in PB until used. Selected sections, including the
implanted sites, were mounted on gelatinized glass slides and stained
using the Nissl technique with 0.1% toluidine blue to determine the
location of stimulating and recording electrodes (Fig. 1C).
Data collection and analysis. Recordings of LFPs, detected �/�-� tran-
sition patterns, 5 V rectangular pulses corresponding to lever presses,
iPad touches, pellet deliveries, and moving images were stored digitally
on a computer through an analog-to-digital converter (CED 1401 Plus,
Cambridge Electronics Design). Collected data were sampled at 25 kHz
for unitary recordings or at 20 kHz for LFPs, with an amplitude resolu-
tion of 16 bits. Data were analyzed off-line with the Spike2 software

 (Cambridge Electronics Design, RRID:SCR_000903) for quantification
of animal performance in the Skinner box, �/�-� pattern presentations
and characteristics, power ratio indices of the �/�-� pattern, and power
spectra of selected LFP recordings. Unitary activity was identified and
computed with the help of specific Spike2 programs. These computed
results were processed for statistical analysis using Sigmaplot 10 (Systat
Software, RRID:SCR_003210). Unless otherwise indicated, data are al-
ways represented as the mean � SEM.
Acquired data were analyzed using one-way or two-way repeated-
measures ANOVA. The Friedman repeated-measures ANOVA on ranks
(nonparametric) statistical test was used if normality or equal variance
tests failed. All of them were followed by Holm–Sidak or Tukey’s post hoc
testing depending on the previous statistical test. The Student’s t test was
applied when necessary. The corresponding degrees of freedom were
reported accompanying the F, � 2, or t-statistic values. The analytical
procedures of the LFP recordings to obtain the time–frequency represen-
tation (spectrogram) and the coherence between pairs of different brain
regions (coherograms) were developed with the help of the Chronux
toolbox (Matlab, MathWorks, RRID:SCR_005547). In most representa-
tions, we selected the following frequency bands: �, 3–12 Hz; �, 12–30
Hz; low �, 30–50 Hz, and high �, 50–150 Hz. Comparisons between
spectrograms of two different groups of data (Fig. 3E,F) were processed
for statistical analysis using the EEGLAB Statistics toolbox (Matlab,
MathWorks, RRID:SCR_010501) and Sigmaplot 10 (Systat Software,
RRID:SCR_003210).
Results
How the �/�-� transition pattern was selected
Animals were implanted with recording electrodes in PrL and M1
cortices, the hippocampal CA1 area, the mediodorsal thalamic nu-
cleus, nucleus accumbens septi, and the ventral tegmental area (Fig.
1A–C). In a preliminary series of experiments, animals were divided
in three groups (n � 5 each) and trained until reaching criterion
(obtaining �80 pellets for two consecutive sessions; see Materials
and Methods) in a conventional Skinner box, and in a modified box
including a multitouch (iPad) screen, using in both cases a fixed 1:1
rewarding ratio. Animals in the conventional Skinner box were
equipped with a wired recording system, while animals belonging to
thegroupslocatedinthemodifiedSkinnerboxwereimplantedwith
either recording wires or a wireless system (Fig. 2). Although perfor-
mance with the touch screen was significantly lower than with the
lever (F(2,28,147) � 5.496, p � 0.028, two-way ANOVA), the three
groups of animals reached the selected criterion at similar times
(F(2,28,12) � 0.634, p � 0.547, one-way ANOVA).
The analysis of LFPs recorded during those operant condi-
tioning sessions, performed in the box equipped with the touch
screen, showed the presence of short time periods (�1 s) charac-
terized by a marked decrease in spectral power, mostly in the �

 band (Fig. 3A–D). This peculiar pattern appeared during perfor-
mance of specific behaviors, such as remaining still (i.e., motion-
less) in the cage, and during rearing or looking into the feeder (Fig.
4). The power in the � band was decreased significantly (�2 �
150.32; degrees of freedom, 2; p � 0.001, Friedman test) from that
present during the periods of time immediately before (Pre) and
after (Post; Fig. 3D,E). Smaller but significant differences (�2 �
18.98;degreesoffreedom,2;p�0.05,Friedmantest)werefoundfor
the high-� band between Pre and Pattern periods (Fig. 3E).
At this stage, we wondered whether this peculiar �/�-� tran-
sition pattern could be used to trigger the presentation of the
selected visual display on the touch screen. In this way, the exper-
imental animal would be able to control the iPad with a specific
LFP pattern generated in its PrL cortex. To facilitate this task, we
quantified two parameters: the spectral power for the � � � � �
bands (Fig. 5A) and the power ratio [(P� � P�)/P�] during the
Pre, Pattern, and Post periods (Fig. 3F,G), but only the first
parameter was used as an iPad trigger. Pre and Post periods pre-
sented similar power ratio values (0.17 and 0.16, respectively;
� 2 � 136.82; degrees of freedom, 2; p � 0.05; Tukey’s post hoc test
for Friedman test). In contrast, the power ratio for the Pattern
period reached a value significantly larger (0.91; � 2 � 136.82;
degrees of freedom, 2; p � 0.001, Tukey’s post hoc test for Fried-
man test). Quotients between Pre/Pattern and Post/Pattern peri-
ods for each of the mentioned (�, �, and �) power spectral bands
yielded similar values (Fig. 3G). The quotient for the � band was
�6 times larger for the Pre/Pattern (6.19) and Post/Pattern (6.47)
periods, but the other frequency bands presented minor differ-
ences (Fig. 3G). On the whole, these analyses indicate that the
selected �/�-� transition pattern was mainly characterized by a
notable decrease in the � band during the Pattern period.
Use of the selected �/�-� transition pattern to trigger the
appearance of a visual display on the touch screen
In a second series of experiments, a group of implanted rats were
trained to touch a visual display that appeared automatically on
the touch screen (Automatic cue; Fig. 5B–D). In this situation,
they reached criterion between the fifth and the ninth condition-
ing sessions. Rats were maintained with this operant task for �11
sessions and then they were trained to activate the appearance of
the same visual display with the generation of the selected �/�-�
transition pattern (Pattern-evoked cue; Fig. 5B–D). To trigger

 the appearance of a visual display on the
touch screen, a program was imple-
mented to detect the Pre-to-Pattern tran-
sition with a delay of �0.25 s (Fig. 5A). In
this situation, rats presented a constant
increment in the number of �/�-� transi-
tion patterns during the first eight ses-
sions, followed by a stabilization (�80
patterns and �60 touches) from the ninth
to the 18th training sessions. Although the
number of evoked patterns reached crite-
rion, the number of screen touches did
not. This lower performance was not due
to the presence of recording wires, since
wireless recordings performed in an addi-
tional group of rats produced similar re-
sults (Fig. 2B,C).
As illustrated in Figure 5B, there were
no significant changes in the number of
�/�-� transition patterns for the two base-
line and 11 training sessions in which the
visual display was presented automatically
(p � 0.05). In contrast, during the sessions
in which the visual display was triggered by
the �/�-� transition pattern, the number of
screen touches progressed in parallel with a
significant (F(30,270,310) � 9.007, p � 0.001,
one-way ANOVA) increase in the number
of pattern detections from the sixth to the
13th conditioning sessions.
We checked whether the use of the
�/�-� transition pattern to trigger the
iPad modified its properties regarding du-
ration and the values reached by the
power ratio index. As shown in Figure 5C,

increased steadily from the first to the
eighth training sessions (from 150 to 197
ms; � 2 � 47.098; degrees of freedom, 30;

ward to intermediate values (from 186 to
160 ms). In contrast, the power ratio
reached peak values at the end of the au-
tomatic cue sessions, being significantly
smaller during pattern-evoked cue ses-
sions (� 2 � 55.423; degrees of freedom,
30; p � 0.05; Friedman test; Fig. 5D).
Thus, the use of the �/�-� transition pat-
tern to trigger the touch screen introduces
small but significant changes in its dura-
tion and spectral power characteristics.
The electrical stimulation of the PrL
cortex prevented the proper
performance of the operant
conditioning task
It is well known that the PrL cortex from
which the �/�-� transition pattern was re-
corded is involved in cognitive, volitional,
and valuation processes (Fuster, 2015;
Kable and Glimcher, 2009; Graybeal et al.,
2011). Specifically, its electrical stimula-
tion seems to prevent the proper perfor-
mance of an operant conditioning task
(Jurado-Parras et al., 2012). In this regard,
we checked whether the recorded area was
also involved in these volitional processes.
For this, we stimulated (a train of 200 Hz
for 200 ms) the PrL cortex in animals
trained to touch the visual display to ob-
tain a pellet as a reward (Fig. 5E–H).
Control rats performed the task con-
sistently, visiting the feeder and getting
the pellet after each screen touch, with a performance index close
to 1 (0.97 � 0.01; Fig. 5G). In contrast, electrical stimulation of
the PrL cortex (Fig. 5F) disturbed this sequential behavior be-
cause, although cortically stimulated rats touched the screen as
many times as controls (t(8,0.05) � 1.043, p � 0.328, Student’s t
test), they either did not visit the feeder (t(8,0.05) � 5.008, p �
0.001, Student’s t test) or they tried to visit it but returned to the
touch screen without eating the reward (t(8,0.05) � 5.334, p �
0.001, Student’s t test). In addition, the time elapsed before
visiting the feeder was significantly increased (U(8,0.05) � 0.001,
p � 0.008, Mann–Whitney rank sum test; Fig. 5H). Rats with
stimulated PrL cortices produced a significantly (t(8,0.05) � 2.586,
p � 0.032, Student’s t test) lower performance index (0.58 �
0.15) than rats in the control group (Fig. 5G), indicating that the
stimulated rats did not visit the feeder and get the pellets delivered
as effectively as controls did (Fig. 5H). These results suggest that
the electrical stimulation of PrL recording sites disturb the proper
performance of specific behavioral sequences related to the oper-
ant task.
Unitary activity in the PrL cortex in presence of the �/�-�
transition pattern
Particular attention was paid to the firing activities of PrL cortex
neurons recorded simultaneously with the spontaneous appear-
ance of the selected �/�-� transition pattern (Automatic cue; Fig.
6A) or during its use to trigger the visual display in the iPad
(Pattern-evoked cue; Fig. 6B). Most (80%) of the recorded units
(36 of 45) were considered as putative PrL pyramidal neurons,
based on the duration of the recorded spikes (�0.5 ms) and on
their spontaneous mean firing rates (2–15 spikes/s). These PrL
neurons presented sustained tonic firings interrupted sometimes
by short bursts of activity. Because of their firing properties, they
appeared to be similar to the regular-spiking, slow-adapting py-
ramidal cells recorded by De
´gene
`tais et al. (2002) in anesthetized
rats and by Leal-Campanario et al. (2013) in alert behaving
rabbits. In accordance with the collected results, averaged PrL
pyramidal neurons presented a significant (F(78,320,399) � 6.994,
p � 0.05, one-way ANOVA) decrease in their mean firing rate
coinciding with the spontaneous appearance of the �/�-� transi-
tion pattern (Fig. 6A) or during its use as Pattern-evoked cue (Fig.
6B). Nevertheless, the same set of neurons recovered their firing
rates significantly (t(19,0.05) � �6.552, p � 0.001, paired Student’s
t test) faster following �/�-� transition patterns used as a cue than
during their spontaneous presentations.
In addition, and as illustrated in Figure 7, the selected �/�-�
transition pattern appeared to coincide with a small (�50%)
decrease in vibrissal activity, suggesting that this specific activity
of the PrL cortex was not related to somatosensory information
or exploratory behaviors, contrary to what has been described for
the S1 and M1 cortical areas (Zagha et al., 2013).

 Effects of the use of the �/�-� transition pattern as a trigger of
the touch screen on the power spectra of LFPs recorded in the
PrL cortex
We were interested in determining whether the use of the LFP pat-
tern as a trigger modified its spectral characteristics. As mentioned
above, rats already trained to touch the screen to obtain a reward
generated spontaneously the �/�-� transition pattern when looking
towardthefeeder,remainingmotionlessinthecage,orrearing(Figs.
4A–C, 8A). In this situation, the pattern was present 24 � 1.5 times
per recording session (Fig. 5B). When the pattern was used to acti-
vate the touch screen, the rat usually generated it by standing still
near the iPad (Figs. 4A, 8C). Figure 8B,D shows an averaged (150
times) time–frequency representation (1250 ms) triggered by the
�/�-� transition pattern during the two different experimental situ-
ations illustrated in Figure 8A,C. As illustrated in Figure 8G–I, a
quantitative analysis of collected data indicated that, when the LFP
patternwasusedasatrigger,itpresentedalowerpowerinthe�band
(t(298,0.05) � 5.949, p � 0.001, Student’s t test) during Pre, Pattern,
andPostperiodsandinthelow-�band(t(298,0.05)�7.863,p�0.001,
Student’s t test) during the Pattern and Post periods. Finally, there
wasadecrease(p�0.05)inthehigh-�bandduringthePostperiod.
Interestingly,therewasnosignificantchangeinthe�bandforanyof
these three periods (t(298,0.05) � �1.444, p � 0.150, Student’s t test).
A precise study of the high-� band revealed a significant decrease
(p � 0.05) ofthepowerinanarrowrangeoffrequencies(115–122Hz;
Fig. 8F) that coincided with the detection of
the LFP pattern when it was used to activate
the touch-screen cue. Similar results were
obtained for the low-� band and, particu-
larly, in the range of frequencies between 32
and 41 Hz (p � 0.05). Interestingly, these
frequencies did not change their spectral
powers before and after the Pattern period.
The opposite alternation in the presence
(p � 0.05) or absence (p � 0.05) of differ-
ences between the two experimental phases
in the three different time periods (Pre:
�250 to 0 ms; Pattern: 0–250 ms; Post:
250–500 ms) was observed in some frequen-
cies of the �, �, and low-� bands (Fig. 8E).
Analysis of coherence between the six
recording sites across training
An interesting question was to determine
whether the selected �/�-� transition pat-
tern was originated in a neural area other
than the PrL cortex or was propagated
from it to other cortical and subcortical
areas. In Figure 9A are illustrated the LFPs
recorded in the six selected areas during a
complete operant conditioning sequence
from going to the iPad to touch the visual
display until eating the provided pellet. As
illustrated in Figure 9B, there was a very
low coherence for the � band (0.06 � C �
0.19) and a slightly higher one for the �
band (0.29 � C � 0.51) when the PrL
cortex was compared with the other five
regions. Only the � band (especially at high
frequencies) presented a high coherence
(C � 0.62) between the PrL and M1 cortices.
A detailed analysis of coherence be-
tween these six regions revealed peaks of
coherence in some frequencies, with values close to 0.6 during the
generation of the �/�-� transition pattern. When LFPs recorded
in the PrL cortex were compared with those recorded in the M1
cortex, three peaks of medium-level coherence were found in
low-� and high-� frequencies (42–65, 109–122, and 139–150
Hz; 0.60 � C � 0.67; Fig. 9C). Coherograms for LFPs recorded
from PrL-mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and PrL-ventral teg-
mental area showed a generalized low coherence in most of the
bands, apart from the low-� band (43–63 and 45–51 Hz respec-
tively; 0.60 � C � 0.67; Fig. 9C,D), mostly during the Pre and the
beginning of the Pattern periods. As illustrated in Figure 4D, the
nucleus accumbens septi and the hippocampal CA1 area presented
thelowestcoherenceinthe�,�,andlow-�bands(0.06�C�0.37),
even though a narrow range of frequencies (between 146 and 150
Hz) reached coherence values from 0.60 to 0.62 for PrL and nucleus
accumbens septi LFPs.
Discussion
Present results indicate that the use of definite LFP patterns gen-
erated in the PrL cortex can be safely used as an alternative for
functional studies associated with BMIs and other neural pro-
cesses related to neurofeedback procedures. As already described,
and further confirmed here, the PrL cortex is involved in voli-
tional and valuation processes (Vertes, 2004; Hoover and Vertes,
2007; Kable and Glimcher, 2009; Graybeal et al., 2011; Fuster,

 2015), including classical and operant conditioning tasks (Leal-
Campanario et al., 2007; Jurado-Parras et al., 2012). In particular,
the effects of the electrical stimulation of the PrL cortex during
the operant sequence used here suggest the involvement of this
area in ongoing cognitive processes related to the association
between touching the screen and getting the corresponding re-
ward—a finding also reported in mice during a similar operant
conditioning task (Jurado-Parras et al., 2012).
The behaviors (i.e., remaining motionless, rearing, and looking
into the feeder; Fig. 4) during which the selected �/�-� transition
patternwasobserved,aswellasitsintrinsicspectralcharacteristics(a
significant decrease in power of the � band associated with smaller
changes in the � and � bands), could be related to the proposal that
LFPspresentinglowamplitudesandhigh-�frequenciesareinvolved
inattentiveprocesses(MoruzziandMagoun,1949;Friesetal.,2001;
Poulet and Petersen, 2008; Zagha et al., 2013) and with specific hy-
pervigilance rhythms associated with immobility and focused atten-
tion (Bouyer et al., 1981; Wang, 2010; Koralek et al., 2012).
Interestingly, an LFP pattern similar to the one described here has
been reported to be present in neocortical S1 and M1 areas during
whisking conditions (Zagha et al., 2013). Nevertheless, apart from
this similarity, the present �/�-� transition pattern was more closely
related to a significant decrease in the activity of whisker motor re-
sponses (Fig. 7). In fact, coherence in LFPs recorded simultaneously
in PrL and M1 cortices decreases during the presentation of the �/�-�
transition pattern (Fig. 9). Thus, this pattern seems not to be related to
specific � activities present in the M1 cortex during selected motor re-
sponses (Zagha et al., 2013; Khanna and Carmena, 2015).
The learning curve generated by the pattern-evoked cue pre-
sented a sigmoidal shape similar to (although with a slower evo-
lution than) that generated by experimental animals during the
automatic presentation of the cue on the touch screen (Fig. 6B) or
during rewarded lever pressing in the Skinner box (Karni et al.,
1998; Buitrago et al., 2004; Jurado-Parras et al., 2012). These
results suggest that the use of an LFP pattern generated in the PrL
cortex to activate an operant conditioning task does not represent
an unviable burden for the experimental animal.
Pattern-evoked cue sessions generated some minor changes in
the selected �/�-� transition pattern, including a progressive in-
crease in pattern duration, a decrease in the power ratio [(P� �
P�)/P�; Fig. 5C,D; resulting from faster recovery in the firing rate
of PrL neurons], and a significant decrease in the spectral power
of � and � bands (Fig. 8H). In fact, these changes increased the
probability of activating the touch screen, since a decrease in � �
� � � power increased the likelihood of reaching the selected
threshold (Fig. 4). Interestingly, these changes were not observed
during the training periodinwhichthecuewaspresentedautomat-
ically, a fact suggesting that changes in the selected �/�-� transition
pattern were not due to the association between the cue (square
virtual button) and the reward, but by the association between the
�/�-� transition pattern and the activation of the cue on the touch
screen. These results coincide with available reports on neuronal
operant conditioning in which the reward is obtained with changes
in the discharge rate of conditioned neurons (Opris et al., 2011;
Arduin et al., 2013). It should be noted that the reported changes in
the selected �/�-� transition pattern observed during pattern-
evoked cue sessions did not modify the main spectral characteristic
ofthepattern—namely,asignificantdecreasein�andhigh-�bands.
Interestingly, the selected �/�-� transition pattern appeared
simultaneously with a significant decrease in the mean firing rate
of PrL cells (Fig. 6) putatively considered as pyramidal neurons
because of their firing properties (De
´gene
`tais et al., 2002; Povy-
sheva et al., 2006; Leal-Campanario et al., 2013). In this regard, it
has been recently proposed that the rostromedial prefrontal cor-
tex plays an active role in preventing the release of newly acquired
motor responses until advanced stages of the acquisition process
and, in general, in the control of the ongoing behavior, depending
on environmental and social constraints (Leal-Campanario et al.,
2007, 2013). The inhibition of PrL cortex neurons during the
�/�-� transition pattern suggests that this pattern corresponds to
a time window for the release of specific behaviors involving
cognitive processes (Fig. 4). In addition, the electrical stimulation
of the recording area evoked disturbing effects on the animal’s
performance during the operant task not related to any visible
deficit in its motor activities (Hamani et al., 2010). Thus, these
results indicate that the stimulation of the PrL cortex disturbed
specific cognitive processes underlying the expected behavioral
sequences (Jackson et al., 2001; Jurado-Parras et al., 2012).
It is important to point out the low coherence values between
LFPs recorded in the PrL cortex, including the selected �/�-� tran-
sition pattern, and LFPs recorded simultaneously in the nucleus ac-
cumbens, the motor cortex, the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, and
the hippocampal CA1 and ventral tegmental areas. Apparently, the
selected �/�-� transition pattern was not generated in and/or prop-
agated to the five mentioned areas, but is an activity restricted to the
PrL cortex. In fact, we obtained higher (0.60 � R � 0.69) levels of
coherence between LFPs recorded in the PrL cortex compared with
those recorded in the motor cortex, the nucleus accumbens, and the
mediodorsal thalamic nucleus in the high-� band during the gener-
ation of the pattern. In this regard, an increase has been reported in
functional interactions in the high-� band between the PrL cortex
and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus during the acquisition of an
instrumental conditioning task (Yu et al., 2012), as well as between
the nucleus accumbens and the PrL cortex during a similar learning
task (Chang et al., 2000). The observation of increased coherence
values for narrow frequency bands between different cortical and
subcortical areas suggests the involvement of different learning and
memory processes taking place at the same time in these different
neural structures using the selected �/�-� transition pattern as a
brain–iPad interface.
Finally,itcanbequestionedwhetherthe�/�-�transitionpattern
was just a byproduct of the preferred behavior (sitting still or mo-
tionless) used by the experimental rats to activate the iPad. In this
regard, and as illustrated in Figure 4, the same LFP pattern was pres-
entduringtheperformanceofotherbehaviors(asrearingorlooking
into the feeder) and, at the same time, was not always present when
the animal remained motionless in the cage—immobility per se is
not enough to generate this LFP pattern (Gervasoni et al., 2004).
Although in early conditioning sessions, animals generated the LFP
pattern in different locations within the Skinner box, the animal
selected this behavior (sitting still near the iPad) across training be-
cause of its adaptive value. In addition, given their rather poor visual
acuity (Prusky et al., 2002) being near the iPad will facilitate an early
detection of the visual cue. Thus, it can safely be expected that a
paralyzed animal should still be able to generate this (and related)
LFP patterns without associating it with a given behavior, certain
movements, or even adjustments to posture.
