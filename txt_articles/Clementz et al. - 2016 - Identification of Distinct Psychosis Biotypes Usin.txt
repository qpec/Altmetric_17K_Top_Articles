Abstract
Objective—Clinical phenomenology remains the primary means for classifying psychoses 
despite considerable evidence that this method incompletely captures biologically meaningful 
differentiations. Rather than relying on clinical diagnoses as the gold standard, this project drew 
on neurobiological heterogeneity among psychosis cases to delineate subgroups independent of 
their phenomenological manifestations.
Method—A large biomarker panel (neuropsychological, stop signal, saccadic control, and 
auditory stimulation paradigms) characterizing diverse aspects of brain function was collected on 
individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder with psychosis 
(N=711), their first-degree relatives (N=883), and demographically comparable healthy subjects 
(N=278). Biomarker variance across paradigms was exploited to create nine integrated variables 
that were used to capture neurobiological variance among the psychosis cases. Data on external 
validating measures (social functioning, structural magnetic resonance imaging, family 
biomarkers, and clinical information) were collected.
Results—Multivariate taxometric analyses identified three neurobiologically distinct psychosis 
biotypes that did not respect clinical diagnosis boundaries. The same analysis procedure using 
clinical DSM diagnoses as the criteria was best described by a single severity continuum 
(schizophrenia worse than schizoaffective disorder worse than bipolar psychosis); this was not the 
case for biotypes. The external validating measures supported the distinctiveness of these 
subgroups compared with clinical diagnosis, highlighting a possible advantage of neurobiological 
versus clinical categorization schemes for differentiating psychotic disorders.
Conclusions—These data illustrate how multiple pathways may lead to clinically similar 
psychosis manifestations, and they provide explanations for the marked heterogeneity observed

 across laboratories on the same biomarker variables when DSM diagnoses are used as the gold 
standard.
Disease classifications in medicine are increasingly transformed by enhanced knowledge of 
molecular foundations, especially where clinical manifestations are diverse and illness 
trajectories are multifarious. There are multiple examples where biological differentiation 
has resulted in classification of diseases with remarkably similar clinical presentations and 
pathology into distinct disorders (1, 2). Statistical modeling of clinical and biomarker data 
sets can facilitate redefinition and reconceptualization of complex human diseases (3, 4). 
More basic knowledge of neurobiological architecture can enhance treatment research and 
outcomes (5, 6) and support development of treatments tailored for patients’ unique 
etiopathologies (7).
Biological reformulations of disease have revolutionized many medical disciplines, but 
classification and treatment of brain diseases subsumed by psychiatry rely on clinical 
phenomenology, despite the call for alternatives (8, 9). Even bipolar disorder with psychosis 
and schizophrenia, the two major and ostensibly distinct psychosis categories, do not “breed 
true” (10,11). There is overlap in susceptibility genes and phenotypes across bipolar disorder 
with psychosis and schizophrenia (12–14) and considerable similarity between different 
psychotic disorders on symptoms, illness course, cognition, psychophysiology and 
neurobiology (15–26). Drug treatments for these conditions overlap extensively (27). 
“Psychosis” could be a final endpoint for multiple psychotogenic etiologies, as “congestive 
heart failure” is a common endpoint of cardiac, renal, and pulmonary disorders, all of which 
are best ameliorated with distinct treatments (for example, see reference 28). A useful 
complementary approach may include the development of a more neuroscience-based 
classification of the psychoses (29).
To evaluate this possibility, we recruited individuals manifesting psychosis, a 
neurobiologically heterogeneous target population with unknown and certainly diverse 
etiologies. We collected a large panel of biomarkers of known relevance to psychosis and 
functional brain activity. Multivariate analyses were used to partition neurobiologically 
distinct subgroups of psychosis cases independent of clinical phenomenology. We refined a 
subset of the biomarker panel that differentiated people with psychosis from healthy 
persons, and we used those biomarkers to differentiate among (create distinct subgroups of) 
psychosis cases. The neurobiological uniqueness of the newly created psychosis categories 
was supported with meaningful external validators (for an illustration of the approach, see 
Figure S1 in the data supplement accompanying the online version of this article). Given the 
apparent distinctiveness of these subgroups, we call them psychosis “biotypes” (biologically 
distinctive phenotypes). Much like for other branches of medicine, the biotypes did not 
respect clinical phenomenological diagnoses (see references 30–33). Identifying additional 
unique characteristics of these psychosis biotypes may facilitate novel clinical, basic, and 
molecular research (34).

 METHOD
Subjects
Subject recruitment, interviews, and laboratory data collection were completed at the 
Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) consortium sites; full 
details have been previously published (26); see also the Methods file in the online data 
supplement). Probands with psychosis (N=711), their first-degree relatives (N=883), and 
demographically comparable healthy subjects (N=278) were fully clinically characterized 
(see Table 1 and Table S1 in the online data supplement). Probands were assessed with the 
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Relatives of the probands recruited for the study 
were also evaluated with the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders (35) to 
evaluate psychosis spectrum personality traits. The healthy persons were without lifetime 
psychotic disorders and had no first-degree relatives with a history of psychotic or bipolar 
disorder according to the Family History Research Diagnostic Criteria (36). The majority of 
probands and a minor subset of relatives were taking psychotropic medications; details are 
provided in Table S2 in the online data supplement. There were minimal associations 
between clinical and/or medication variables and biomarker outcomes (15–18,20–22,25). 
The institutional review board at every participating institution approved this project; all 
subjects provided informed consent prior to inclusion after they obtained a complete 
description of the study.
Procedures
Recording and testing conditions were similar and stimulus presentation and recording 
equipment were identical across sites. Experimenters across sites also were trained and 
continually monitored to ensure comparable laboratory data collection procedures. As a 
result, there were no site effects that influenced group comparisons on any laboratory 
biomarker measure (15–18, 20–22, 25).
Laboratory Tasks
Biotypes were derived by using laboratory tasks that assess brain function at the 
neurocognitive/perceptual level (traditional “endophenotypes” [37] that can be assessed 
across diverse clinical and laboratory settings). Using variables at this level of analysis also 
afforded the opportunity to test the validity of the outcomes against more clinical (social 
functioning) and more basic (structural magnetic resonance imaging) measures. This 
biomarker panel was constructed, given known and purported neurophysiological deviations 
in psychosis (38), by using all scored phenotypic data from the B-SNIP assessments, after 
being statistically reduced for redundancy (see below), except for social function, brain 
structure, and first-degree relative phenotype data, which were reserved for external 
validation. Data were scored according to previously published criteria (see the Methods file 
in the online data supplement).
Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS)—This battery assesses 
multiple cognitive functions (39, 40), although a global neuropsychological functioning 
composite score integrating over multiple domains provided the best measure of psychosis-
related cognitive deviation (18). Age-and sex-stratified normative data (18) were used to

 compute these composite scores for each participant (see also the Methods file in the online 
data supplement).
Pro- and anti-saccade tasks—Prosaccades assess speed of visual orienting (41) 
(patients with psychosis show variable slowed or speeded response times [41, 42]). 
Antisaccades assess inhibitory control under perceptual conflict because the visual stimulus 
and required response location are incompatible (patients with psychosis have increased 
error rates [22, 41, 43]). The participants performed pro- and antisaccade tasks under 
identical conditions, which have been previously described (22; see also the online 
supplementary methods).
Stop signal task—Stop signal performance measures the efficiency and adequacy of 
cognitive control when response activation and generation regarding a single stimulus 
location are placed in conflict (there are delayed response times and increased errors in 
psychosis [16]). Details of the task have been presented previously (16; see also the online 
supplementary methods).
Auditory paired stimuli and oddball evoked brain responses—Evoked brain 
responses to repetitive auditory stimuli (paired-stimuli task) (17) and predetermined auditory 
targets randomly interspersed with nontarget (or standard) auditory events (oddball task) 
(15) are deviant in patients with psychosis (15, 17). These paradigms assess the neural 
dynamics of preparation for and recovery from auditory sensory activations, neural 
responses to stimulus salience, and neural differentiation of relevant from irrelevant auditory 
stimulus events. Stimulus presentation characteristics for electroencephalography (EEG) 
data have been presented previously (15, 17; see also the supplementary methods in the 
online data supplement).
Magnetic resonance imaging acquisition and voxel-based morphometry—
Structural three-dimensional magnetic resonance images were acquired on 3-T scanners of 
different manufacturers, including GE Signa, Siemens Trio, Philips Achieva, and Siemens 
Allegra, by using high-resolution T1-weighted sequences from the Alzheimer’s Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative protocol, standardized across sites (44). The images were 
preprocessed by experienced analysts blind to participant identity, and they were prepared 
for voxel-based morphometry analysis in MATLAB7/SPM8/VBM8/ DARTEL following 
standard procedures (44; see also the online supplementary methods).
Data Analyses for Biotypes
Data integration within paradigms—Initial analyses identified measures from the full 
B-SNIP battery differentiating psychosis probands from healthy persons. For five of the six 
laboratory paradigms, there were multiple such variables (the BACS had only the composite 
score): five saccade variables (collapsed across pro- and antisaccade tasks), two stop signal 
variables, and 31 EEG variables (collapsed across paired-stimuli and oddball tasks; see 
Table S3 in the online data supplement). To provide the most efficient information for 
biotype construction, data reduction within each paradigm set (saccades, stop signal task, 
EEG) was captured by using principal component analysis (15, 17). This step was 
Clementz et al.

 undertaken because we assumed that individual variables were not assessing unique aspects 
of brain functioning (e.g., antisaccade response latency and prosaccade latency both index 
speed of visual orienting; the N100 response during the paired-stimuli task assesses a neural 
response that is highly similar to the N100 response during the oddball task). Principal 
component analysis reduces data dimensionality (maximizing signal to noise) by replacing a 
group of variables with a linear combination of those variables, thus reducing information 
redundancy and retaining maximal meaningful explanatory variance across all measures. As 
in regression analysis, where too many (redundant) predictor variables may result in model 
over-fitting and problems with generalization and replication, data dimension reduction 
(through principal component analysis, for instance) has been demonstrated to improve the 
classification accuracy of taxometric methods such as k-means clustering (45).
The data integration step yielded two saccade, one stop signal, and five EEG components 
(see Table S3 in the data supplement for principal component analysis pattern matrices by 
paradigm set). These components (biomarker composite scores) provide more efficient 
measurements of important brain response constructs than do any one of the individual 
variables that supported their construction. For each of these biomarker composites, Bartlett 
factor scores were generated for each subject, and these scores, along with the BACS score, 
were used in biotype analyses. Tables 2A and 2B provide the effect size separation between 
individuals in each psychosis class designation (DSM diagnoses and biotypes) and healthy 
persons (standard deviation for the healthy subjects in the denominator) for each of the bio-
marker composite variables.
Cluster determination—The optimal number of subgroups to extract from unsupervised 
clustering with the biomarker composite variables was determined by using 1) the gap 
statistic, which provides a formalization of the point at which within-cluster dispersion 
(pooled within-cluster sum of squares from the centroid) becomes less pronounced as a 
function of the number of clusters assumed (46), and 2) the preclustering step of the 
TwoStep cluster analysis algorithm (SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 22.0; IBM, 
Armonk, N.Y.).
The gap statistic results are based on the difference between the pooled within-cluster sums 
of squares around cluster centroids as a function of the number of clusters requested and that 
same function under a null distribution (46). In our case, the null distribution was calculated 
by randomly shuffling variables across observations (sampling with replacement) such that 
values for BACS, for instance, were randomly paired with values on all other measures used 
for biotype construction. We generated 10,000 new observations in this fashion. These plots 
for the actual data and null distributions (mean of the middle 99% of cases) are shown in 
Figure S2A in the data supplement, along with the gap function in supplementary Figure 
S2B. The largest gap is at four clusters, but that value does not significantly differ from the 
three-cluster case, so three subgroups most parsimoniously captured the data structure.
The preclustering step of the TwoStep cluster algorithm uses a hierarchical cluster approach, 
with determination of number of clusters based on distance and rate of change criteria (the 
procedure is completely described in a white paper technical report from SPSS: “The SPSS 
TwoStep Cluster Component” (http://www.spss.ch/upload/1122644952_The%20SPSS

 %20TwoStep%20Cluster%20Component.pdf).The precluster step output for our data is 
shown in Table S4 in the online data supplement. As with the gap distribution above, this 
independent method indicates that three subgroups most parsimoniously capture the 
underlying data structure.
Biotype construction—Biotypes were formed and the bio-marker composite variables 
were integrated for visualization and analytical purposes by using the following three steps. 
First, k-means clustering was used for class formation (47). This method finds partitions 
such that clusters are defined by their centroids, and the sum of the squared Euclidian 
distance (our distance metric) of all cases from assigned cluster centroids is minimized. 
Only psychosis probands were used at this stage, given that the biomarkers differentiated 
psychotic and healthy persons, so the problem was meaningfully parsing variance within the 
psychosis probands. On the basis of the results of the gap statistic and the TwoStep cluster 
algorithm, three subgroups (biotypes) were used to parsimoniously capture cognitive-
perceptual classification variance among the participants with psychosis. In the second step 
of biomarker construction, all biomarker composite variables were standardized to mean 0 
and unit variance. No outliers were identified that required special handling before cluster 
optimization proceeded. The k-means algorithm achieved cluster stability within 14 
iterations, and it resulted in numbers of observations in the clusters (biotypes), as described 
in Tables 1 and 2. In the third step, the outcome captured biotype membership in the nine-
variable space of the biomarker composites. To provide an efficient and more easily 
visualized means for describing group differences, we used biotype membership as the 
classification variable and performed multivariate discriminant analysis to summarize the 
relationship among the biomarker composite variables. This discriminant analysis 
summarized variance that maximally separated groups (in this instance, the three biotypes). 
This step was undertaken to ease visualization of the subgroup differentiations and to allow 
a simple metric for comparing proband and relative groups on the biomarker composite 
variables that supported biotype construction (see Tables 2A and 2B for group comparisons 
on the nine bio-marker composite variables individually). Two significant functions 
summarized biotype separations, which we named “cognitive control” and “sensorimotor 
reactivity” given their constituents (48) (Table 2; online Table S5). These discriminant 
functions were also used to test classification accuracy with a jackknife procedure (49) and 
to generate variable scores for healthy persons and relatives on cognitive control and 
sensorimotor reactivity.
RESULTS
Distinct Psychosis Biotypes Identified by Multivariate Biomarkers
Table 2A provides biomarker composite effect size differentiations of probands and healthy 
subjects by DSM diagnosis and biotype. In general, the DSM diagnostic groups showed 
differences in severity on the biomarker composites (with schizophrenia probands in general 
differing from healthy subjects more than did the schizoaffective disorder probands, who 
differed more than those with bipolar disorder with psychosis), while the three biotypes had 
distinctive patterns of abnormality across biomarkers that were neither entirely nor 
efficiently captured by a severity continuum (see below). Discriminant function coefficients

 were used to generate a score for each individual on cognitive control and sensorimotor 
reactivity. Means (standard score units) by group on cognitive control and sensorimotor 
reactivity are provided in Figure 1. Healthy subjects are included in these comparisons, 
although they were not used to generate the discriminant functions. These discriminant 
functions correctly classified 91% of the psychosis probands by biotype. A similar analysis 
using DSM diagnostic groups yielded only one significant discriminant function that 
described a severity continuum with modest separations between schizophrenia and bipolar 
disorder with psychosis at the extreme ends. This function correctly classified only 45% of 
the psychosis probands into their DSM diagnostic groups (Table S6 and Figure S3 in the 
online data supplement).
Because the biotypes were constructed by using the probands, we did not test statistically for 
differences between proband groups (those groups were constructed to be maximally 
differentiated). As can be seen in Figure 1, however, healthy persons (who were not involved 
in generating the biotypes) differed significantly on cognitive control from biotype 1 (t=27.7, 
df=475, p<0.001) and biotype 2 (t=22.3, df=512, p<0.001) but not from biotype 3. Healthy 
persons differed significantly from all three biotypes on sensorimotor reactivity (biotype 1: 
t=11.4, df=475, p<0.001; biotype 2: t=–6.43, df=512, p<0.001; biotype 3: t=3.87, df=555, 
p<0.001) (see Figure 1). Biotype 1 had the highest proportion of inhibition errors, the lowest 
amplitude brain responses to auditory stimuli but comparatively accentuated neural 
responding to repeated auditory stimuli, sluggish responding to sensory inputs, and the 
poorest target (critical stimulus) detection. Biotype 2 was moderately impaired on cognitive 
control (compromised compared with healthy persons but intermediate between biotypes 1 
and 3). However, biotype 2 had accentuated sensorimotor reactivity, including normal to 
higher amplitude neural responding to auditory inputs, the highest intrinsic (not specifically 
stimulus-related) neural activities, but intact neurophysiological evidence of target detection. 
Biotype 3 probands did not differ from healthy persons on cognitive control (despite having 
a psychosis diagnosis) but were modestly deviant on sensorimotor reactivity. They had 
modestly more inhibition errors than was normal, modestly lower neural responding to 
auditory inputs, modestly impaired target detection, and the fastest visual orienting times of 
the three biotypes (significantly faster than healthy persons; see Table 2A). Compared with 
DSM diagnoses, the biotypes reduced variance on the biomarker composites by 38% on 
average and around the subgroup centroids by 29% on average (see Figure S3 in the data 
supplement). These bio-marker outcomes by biotype suggest more distinct functional brain 
correlates of psychosis manifestation than were captured by clinical phenomenological 
diagnostic definitions (see below).
Clinical Characteristics of Biotypes and Relation to DSM Diagnoses
There was an unequal distribution of DSM diagnoses across biotypes (Table 1), with biotype 
1 having more schizophrenia (59%) and biotype 3 having more bipolar disorder with 
psychosis (44%). Nevertheless, as illustrated in Figure 2 and Figure S3 in the data 
supplement, there was considerable mixing across biotypes of DSM psychosis diagnoses. 
Similarly, there was considerable overlap across the neurobiologically distinct biotypes on 
global psychosis-related clinical ratings (Table 1). First, biotypes 1 and 2 did not differ in 
scores on the Schizo-Bipolar Scale (19), a global measure of schizophrenia symptoms (high

 scores) versus bipolar disorder symptoms (low scores) (see Figure 2). Second, biotype 3 had 
lower ratings for positive and negative symptoms than the other two bio-types. Third, 
biotypes did not differ on mania-related symptoms.
Two other clinical characteristics differentiated the bio-types (Table 1). First, the biotypes 
significantly differed in ratings on the Birchwood Social Functioning Scale, which assesses 
social engagement, psychosocial independence and competence, and occupational success; 
biotype 1 showed the most psychosocial impairment, and biotype 3 had the least 
impairment. Second, the rate of cases of psychosis or psychosis-related personality disorder 
among the relatives of the biotype 3 probands was significantly lower than the rates for the 
relatives of probands with the other two biotypes (see Table S7 in the online supplement for 
the same data by DSM diagnosis).
Structural Neuroanatomical Features of Biotypes
These data were not used in biotype creation, so, like data on social functioning (see above) 
and for biological relatives (see below), they provide an independent means for validating 
biotype categorizations. Figure 3 shows the deviations of whole brain gray matter volume 
from that of the healthy subjects by biotype; Table 3 presents effect sizes by region for 
biotypes and DSM diagnoses (see supplementary Table S8 for more details on regional 
differences). Probands with biotype 1 had widespread gray matter reductions in 
predominantly frontal, cingulate, temporal, and parietal cortex, as well as in the basal 
ganglia and thalamus. The gray matter changes for biotype 2 were regionally similar to those 
of biotype 1, albeit with lower effect sizes than in biotype 1. In biotype 3, the probands’ 
volumetric reductions were modest and predominantly localized to anterior limbic brain 
regions. Alternatively, although the bipolar probands had modest deviations from healthy 
subjects on regional brain volumes, the probands with schizophrenia and schizoaffective 
disorder were statistically indistinguishable across brain regions on these measures (see 
Table 3 and reference 44).
Neurobiological and Clinical Characteristics of Biological Relatives by Biotype
As indicated in Table 2C, the biomarkers showed substantial intrafamilial similarity, with 
these estimates being largely enhanced by discriminant function integration across bio-
markers. First, Figure 1 shows the same, but less extreme, pattern of performance on 
cognitive control (F=37.6, df=3, 997, p<0.001) and sensorimotor reactivity (F=9.2, df=3, 
997, p<0.001) for the biological relatives of the three proband biotype classes (see also Table 
2B). Even when all the clinically affected relatives were removed from these analyses, the 
same, but attenuated, pattern of significant differences remained (see Figure S4 in the data 
supplement), indicating that cognitive control and sensorimotor reactivity are indexing 
independent constitutional indicators of liability for these psychosis bio-types. Second, the 
relatives also showed the same pattern of compromised social functioning as the probands, 
with the relatives of biotype 1 probands being the most compromised and the relatives of the 
biotype 3 probands being the least compromised (see Table 1). Even when clinically affected 
relatives were removed, the relatives of the biotype 1 and 2 probands still showed 
compromised social functioning compared with healthy persons. Third, the relatives showed 
structural brain deviations intermediate in magnitude between their respective probands and

 the healthy persons, but with specific and important differences as a function of proband 
group (see Figure 3, Table 3, and Table S8 in the data supplement). Biotype 1 relatives, 
similar to their probands, had widespread gray matter volume loss. Biotype 2 relatives, 
however, had predominantly posterior, mostly occipital and cerebellar, reductions. Biotype 3 
relatives had more modest reductions, mostly limited to temporal regions. When the relatives 
with psychosis-related diagnoses were removed, all relative groups still showed significant 
gray matter volume reductions.
DISCUSSION
The neurobiological heterogeneity across the psychosis spectrum illustrates the difficulty 
with attempting to derive etiological and neurobiological distinctiveness from clinical 
phenomenology alone. The present approach drew on bio-marker heterogeneity to identify 
brain-based psychosis biotypes independent of specific clinical features (other than presence 
of psychosis). Each biotype included all DSM psychosis categories, but probands diagnosed 
with schizophrenia were more numerous in biotype 1 (although 20% had bipolar disorder 
with psychosis) and probands diagnosed with bipolar disorder with psychosis were more 
numerous in biotype 3 (although 32% had schizophrenia), respectively. Measures not used in 
creation of the biotypes, including social functioning, brain structure, and characteristics of 
biological relatives, independently supported biotype distinctiveness. When considered 
across proband and relative data, the biotype subgroups were superior to DSM diagnostic 
classes in between-group separations on external validating measures, illustrating the former 
scheme’s superiority for capturing neurobiological distinctiveness.
An important feature of our approach was integration across numerous laboratory biomarker 
measures of psychosis-related neurobiological deviations. The statistically derived 
constructs, labeled “cognitive control” and “sensorimotor reactivity” given their constituents, 
have played prominent roles in previous attempts to describe neurobiological deviations in 
psychosis, most notably schizophrenia (48). These multivariate constructs were superior to 
the individual bio-markers (had larger effect sizes) for distinguishing between subgroups. 
This was true for both biotype designations and DSM diagnostic classes. Epigenetics, 
etiological heterogeneity, pleiotropy, and variable expressivity among other factors, 
influence phenotypic manifestations (50), making it difficult for a single laboratory measure 
to be pathognomonic for complex psychiatric diseases.
These data also indicated that there may be multiple pathways to clinically similar psychosis 
manifestations. Biotype 1, the subgroup with the fewest probands, was most prototypical of 
the chronic, deteriorated, poor-outcome cases often considered to capture the essence of 
schizophrenia (19, 23, 26, 29). These participants showed profound dysfunction on cognitive 
control and had severely compromised neural reactivity to even simple sensory events. Their 
first-degree biological relatives showed the same pattern of deviations. In contrast, 
individuals in biotype 2, although also demonstrating marked, but less severe, cognitive 
control dysfunction, were characterized by accentuated sensorimotor reactivity, a feature that 
has been previously described (51). This pattern of deviations for biotype 2 probands was 
mirrored in their biological relatives. Nevertheless, biotypes 1 and 2 had highly similar 
clinical severity and evidence for familial psychosis risk. In contrast, individuals in biotype

 3, the largest of the groups, showed less severe clinical psychosis manifestations, nearly 
normal cognition, and sensorimotor reactivity less distinguishable from normal.
These differential patterns of biomarkers across biotypes invoke an explanation for the 
marked heterogeneity in DSM diagnoses that is routinely observed across research 
laboratories, even on the same biomarker variables. Individuals with biotype 1, being the 
most compromised, might be more likely to be recruited in inpatient settings, while those 
with biotype 2 or 3 might be more prominent in outpatient clinics. In addition, researchers 
working in settings that captured mostly biotype 3 probands would justly conclude that 
studying neurobiological risk indicators (endophenotypes) for psychosis among biological 
relatives was a futile enterprise. Investigators in molecular genetic studies sampling high 
concentrations of biotype 3 probands also might conclude that a large proportion of the 
variance in psychosis genetic risk was captured by spontaneous mutations (12–14). 
Recruitment strategy and subject sampling, therefore, might influence determinations of 
beliefs concerning the core neurobiological features of psychosis.
These divergent biomarker patterns across biotypes also illustrate the difficulty with using 
solely clinical psychosis diagnoses as the “gold standard” for capturing neurobiological 
distinctiveness (32, 33). The psychosis probands (as a group) showed at least some degree of 
cognitive control deviation, but the remarkable difference between diminution and 
accentuation of sensorimotor reactivity across individuals with psychosis would certainly 
lead to devaluing this group of measures for understanding psychosis neurobiology in mixed 
samples (the overall mean would be close to that seen among healthy persons). In contrast, 
molecular, pharmacological, and genetic studies directly comparing biotype 1, 2, and 3 
subgroups, as defined by both cognitive control and sensorimotor reactivity constructs, could 
be useful for disentangling at least part of the etiological and pathophysiological 
heterogeneity purported to typify clinical psychosis (52).
The biotype outcome provides proof of concept that structural and functional brain 
biomarker measures can sort individuals with psychosis into groups that are 
neurobiologically distinctive and appear biologically meaningful. These outcomes inspire 
specific theories that could be fruitfully investigated. First, biotypes 1 and 2 should be of 
greater interest in familial genetic investigations, while perhaps biotype 3 would be more 
informative for explorations of environmental correlates of psychosis risk, spontaneous 
mutations, and/or epigenetic modifications. Second, treatments for biotype 1 would be 
naturally directed both to profoundly compromised cognitive control and to correcting 
reduced neural activations that compromise signal-to-noise ratios for discerning 
environmental stimulus relevance (manifest in EEG signals). Third, biotypes 1 and 2 could 
be explored for potassium and/or calcium channel alterations and channel-based therapies 
that may correct neuronal hypo- or hyperexcitability (53). It is possible that biotypes and/or 
related neurobiological parsing approaches will contribute to defining biological correlates 
of psychosis. Whether these constructs become important in psychosis research will depend 
on their usefulness, i.e., on their ability to foster and support incisive molecular, genetic, and 
treatment distinctions.

 The present approach to parsing neurobiological variance among the psychoses has 
limitations that we attempted to minimize but could not completely overcome in this single 
project. First, the probands were mostly medicated, chronically psychotic, and tested at one 
time point; we have yet to demonstrate the longitudinal stability of these subgroupings, 
though the biomarkers themselves may be stable traits. Second, there was no replication 
sample in this initial data analysis, even though collection of a larger replication sample is in 
process. We did, however, test the accuracy of the neurobiological classification by using a 
jackknife procedure, and the data on first-degree relatives provided additional and important 
support for the subgrouping scheme (these data were not used in biotype construction). 
Third, the included biomarkers were chosen on the basis of their previously demonstrated 
success (at the initiation of this project) for distinguishing psychotic disorder subjects 
(probands and relatives) from healthy persons (38). It is unlikely that this demonstration of a 
promising means for capturing neuro-biological distinctiveness in psychosis describes all 
relevant possibilities; the inclusion of additional biomarkers may be useful in this regard. 
Fourth, the estimation of bio-type membership, at present, requires extensive biomarker 
assessments. A means for estimating such membership, however, through clinical 
examination would be an extremely useful contribution to our understanding of the 
psychoses.

 FIGURE 2. Distribution of Schizo-Bipolar Scale Scores of Probands With Psychosis, by Biotype 
and DSM Diagnosisa,b
a Probands with schizophrenia have higher scores, probands with bipolar disorder with 
psychosis have lower scores, and probands with schizoaffective disorder have intermediate 
scores on the Schizo-Bipolar Scale (19), and all three clinical diagnoses are prominently 
represented within each biotype. These two features indicate that neurobiological 
distinctiveness of the biotypes is not captured by DSM diagnoses.
b Because there are so many data points, some scores were pseudorandomly jittered around 
their mean.

 FIGURE 3. Gray Matter Differences From Healthy Subjects in Voxel-Based Morphometry 
Results for Probands With Psychosis and Their First-Degree Relatives, by Proband Biotypea
a Images are displayed in neurological convention. Outcomes are reported at p=0.05, with 
cluster-wise family-wise-error correction.
b Biotype1had the most extensive volume reductions, with the largest effects in the frontal, 
cingulate, temporal, and parietal cortex, as well as basal ganglia and thalamus. Biotype 2 had 
volume reductions regionally overlapping with those in biotype 1, with the largest effects in 
the frontotemporal cortex, parietal cortex, and cerebellum, albeit of a lesser magnitude 
overall than for biotype 1. Biotype 3 had smaller clusters of reductions that were primarily 
distributed over frontal, cingulate, and temporal regions.
c The biological relatives of biotype 1 probands showed predominantly anterior, mostly 
frontotemporal, gray matter volume differences. The relatives of biotype 2 probands showed 
posterior, mostly cerebellar, reductions. The relatives of biotype 3 probands showed small 
clusters of reductions limited to bilateral temporal regions and right inferior frontal regions.
