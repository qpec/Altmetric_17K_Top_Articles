Objective. To determine if the rate of weight loss (WL) is associated with metabolic changes independent of the absolute WL.
Methods. WL and health changes were assessed in 11,281 patients attending a publicly funded clinical weight management
program over a treatment period of 12.7 months. Early weight loss rate (WLR) in the first 3–6 months and overall WLR were
categorized as Fast WLR (≥1 kg/wk), Recommended WLR (0.5 to 0.9 kg/wk), or Slow WLR (<0.5 kg/wk). Results. On average,
patients attained a 6.6 ± 7.3 kg (5.8 ± 5.7%) WL over 12.8 ± 13.1 months. Prior to adjusting for covariates, patients with Fast WLR
(−24.7 ± 13.4 kg) at 3–6 months had a greater overall WL as compared to those with Recommended WLR (−13.3 ± 8.7 kg) and
Slow WLR (−5.0 ± 5.4 kg). Fast WLR also had greater improvements in the overall waist circumference and blood pressure than
patients with Slow or Recommended WLR. However, after adjustment for absolute WL, Early and overall Recommended and Fast
WLR did not differ in the changes in any of the health markers (P > 0.05). Conversely, the absolute WL sustained is significantly
associated with changes in metabolic health independent of WLR (P < 0.001). Similar results were observed with WLR over the
entire treatment period. Conclusions. Faster rates of WL are associated with a greater absolute WL and larger improvements in
waist circumference and blood pressure. However, after adjusting for the larger absolute WL sustained, early and overall faster
WLR do not appear to have advantages for improving metabolic health markers. Tus, the absolute WL attained may be the most
important factor for improving metabolic health.
1.Introduction
Current weight management guidelines emphasize the
importance of attaining a 5% weight loss (WL) to achieve
health benefits [1, 2]. However, it is unclear whether the rate
of WL influences health beyond the absolute weight change
attained.
Interestingly,
the
recommended
1-2 lb/wk
(∼0.5
to −1 kg/wk) WLR (Rec WLR) in the 1998 guidelines [3] was
based on reducing the risk for gallstone formation [3–5].
Faster WL has long been documented to be associated with
larger WL overall [6, 7], but has historically thought to be
associated with worse or no better long-term weight man-
agement [6, 8]. However, a review by Astrup and R¨
ossner
suggests that individuals with greater initial WLR may also
be associated with better long-term weight loss maintenance
when long-term weight management care is given [6]. Given
that obesity is now viewed as a chronic disease, long-term
care should be an expectation for obesity management, and
weight maintenance programs of over a year are currently
recommended by the guidelines [9]. To date, most studies
examining WLR have examined the impact on body com-
position [10, 11] or resting metabolic rate [10–12] and report
no significant differences, though they may have been un-
derpowered. We are aware of only three studies other than
our preliminary analysis that has examined the influence of
WLR on CVD risk factors [13–15]. Tese intervention
studies designed the WL to be similar between groups and
did not observe any differences in BP or lipid changes be-
tween fast and slow WL but may have been underpowered.
We have previously shown that faster WL is associated with
greater WL and reductions in BP, but after adjustment for

 overall WL, there were no significant differences in BP re-
duction between fast and slow WL [16]. However, these
studies did not directly examine whether WLR faster than
the commonly recommended 1-2 lb/wk results in differen-
tial effects on health independent of the absolute WL and
thus warrants further investigation.
Tus, the objective of the current study is to determine
whether the rate of WL is associated with changes in health
factors independent of the absolute WL.
2.Materials and Methods
2.1.StudyPopulation. Te study population included 11,283
patients who attended the Wharton Medical Clinic (WMC)
Weight Management Program between July 2008 and July
2017. Data up to 5 years of treatment were obtained from
electronic medical files. To ensure a fairer comparison
among WLR groups, patients were included only if they
attended the clinic for at least 3 months and lost at least
0.1 kg of weight (i.e., those who lost weight) and had re-
peated metabolic variable measurements. Patients who had
bariatric surgery were excluded from the analysis (n � 25).
All participants gave their written consent for the use of their
medical data for research purposes and were informed that
their decision to participate would not influence their
medical treatment at WMC. Participants did not receive any
form of stipends. All methods were approved by the York
University Research Ethics Board (Ethics Certificate #:
2009–117, 2013–123, e2017–166).
As described previously [16–18], WMC is a physician
referral-based clinic designed to educate and enable patients
to implement strategies to manage their weight and improve
their health. Patients attend the clinic on a monthly basis or
as needed to have individual meetings with bariatric edu-
cators (with a university degree in nutrition) to discuss
personalized weight management strategies, dietary plans,
and physical activity options. Patients meet with physicians
to discuss medication options, interest in bariatric surgery,
and any obesity-related comorbidities. If indicated, patients
are referred for additional tests, to other medical pro-
fessionals, or for bariatric surgery. Patients can attend the
program for as long as they wish and are able to return to the
clinic after long absences. Te clinic operates within the
Ontario Health Insurance Plan, and all services are provided
at no charge to the patient.
Patients undergo a standard battery of clinical tests
including waist circumference, blood pressure (BP), fasting
glucose, triglycerides (TG), and high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) assessed using standard clinical methods. Partici-
pants were included if they had change data for at least one
health measure (n �1,697 to 11,223); thus, the sample size
for the metabolic data analyses varied depending on the
availability of data.
Body weight (BW) was measured by staff at each patient
visit on a calibrated MedWeight, MS-2510 Digital High
Capacity Platform Scales (Itin Scale Co, Inc., NY). Weight
change was calculated as final observed BW-initial BW. For
each health measure, the final weight that most closely
corresponded to the health measure timeframe was used.
Te rate of weight loss was calculated as the weight change/
treatment time during the first 3–6 months and over the
entire treatment period that exceed, met, or was slower than
the 1-2 lb/wk (∼0.45–0.91 kg/wk) recommendation: Fast
WLR (≥0.91 kg/wk), Rec WLR (0.45 to 0.90 kg/wk), or Slow
WLR (<0.45 kg/wk).
2.2. Statistical Analyses. Patient characteristics and baseline
metabolic variables were presented as means ± SD stratified
by early WLR. Group differences in participant character-
istics were assessed using an analysis of variance for con-
tinuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical
variables. Te independent associations of overall and early
WL and the rate of WL (continuous and categorical with Rec
WLR as the reference group) on changes in health markers
were adjusted for age, sex, baseline values, relevant medi-
cation (yes/no), and use of weight loss medications (yes/no).
Results were similar when only baseline metabolic value and
absolute WL were adjusted for, and thus, only the final
model is presented. Bonferroni post hoc tests were used. All
statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS In-
stitute, Cary, NC, USA). Statistical significance was estab-
lished at P < 0.05.
3.Results
Participant characteristics stratified by early WLR is shown
in Table 1. In general, those with early Fast WLR were
younger and had a higher BMI than those with Slow WLR or
Rec WLR. Patients had a greater overall WL in Fast WLR
(−24.7 ± 13.4 kg) at 3–6 months as compared with those with
Rec WLR (−13.3 ± 8.7 kg) and Slow WLR (−5.0 ± 5.4 kg).
Furthermore, early Fast WLR had greater overall im-
provements in waist circumference (−15.2 versus −9.5 or
4.2 cm) and blood pressure (SBP: −9 versus −7 or −3 mmHg;
DBP: −6 versus −4 or −2 mmHg) than patients with early
Slow WLR or Rec WLR (P < 0.05 for all). Tese differences
remained true with adjustment for age, sex, baseline body
weight, treatment time, and WL medication use (results not
shown).
In a model adjusting for absolute WL, patients with early
Slow WLR, Rec WLR, and Fast WLR had similar im-
provements in waist and BP (P < 0.05), but modest to no
changes in the lipids or glucose (Figure 1). After adjusting
for absolute WL, WLR groups no longer differed in the
changes in any of the health markers or waist circumference
over the intervention (P > 0.05), whereas absolute WL
remained independently associated with changes in all of the
health markers (P < 0.0001). When early WLR during the
first 3 to 6 months was examined as a continuous variable,
the WLR was associated with greater reductions in glucose
independent of absolute weight loss (β � −0.34 mM/kg/wk,
P � 0.009), but there was no association between early WLR
and the other metabolic risk factors (P > 0.05).
Similarly, when examining the rate of WL independent
of absolute WL over the entire intervention, the overall Rec
WLR and Fast WLR did not differ in changes in any of the
health markers (P > 0.05, Figure 2). Te overall Slow WLR
2

 had significantly smaller reductions in waist circumference
and SBP as compared with Rec WLR (P < 0.05). Conversely,
the overall Slow WLR had significantly better improvements
in HDL as compared with Rec WLR and Fast WLR
(P < 0.05). As with early WLR, absolute WL remained sig-
nificantly associated with all health changes independent of
the overall WLR (Figure 2, P < 0.0001). When the WLR over
the entire intervention was examined as a continuous

in SBP (β � −2.57 mmHg/kg/wk, P < 0.0001), but smaller
improvements in HDL (β � −0.06 mM/kg/wk, P < 0.0001).
4.Discussion
Our study expands on traditional examinations of WL, by
illustrating that the superior improvements in obesity re-
duction and health improvements associated with faster WL
as compared to the commonly recommended 1-2 lb/wk are
abolished after adjusting for greater WL. Conversely, ab-
solute weight loss is significantly associated with improve-
ments in all health risk factors. Tus, obesity interventions
should focus on long-term weight loss maintenance.
Current weight management guidelines generally rec-
ommend a WLR of 1-2 lb/wk (0.45–0.91 kg/wk) with a 5%
WL target overall to achieve health benefits [2, 3, 8].
However, this recommended WLR is for reducing the risk
for gallstone formation [4] and was not created based on
associations with obesity or cardiometabolic health out-
comes. In accordance with previous observations [7, 16],
faster WLR is associated with greater WL overall as com-
pared to slower WLR. We extend these findings to show that
there is also a greater reduction in waist circumference with
faster WLR. Tis is in contrast with previous smaller studies
that report similar reductions in waist [14] and body fat
[11, 14, 19] with fast versus slow WLR. However, some of
these studies were also designed to be similar in WL attained.
After controlling for differences in WL, we also observe that
there were similar reductions in waist by WLR. In the model
with the overall WLR, there was a small statistically sig-
nificant smaller reduction in waist (0.71 cm) with slower
WLR than for weight losses of 1-2 lb/wk that is within the
range for measurement error, particularly for populations
with severe obesity [20]. Tus, it appears that the body
compositional changes with fast and slow WLR may be
similar after accounting for differences in absolute WL.
Whether the WLR results in differential effects on health
independent of the absolute WL is unclear. Tree studies in
smaller cohorts report that there are no differences in health
changes between fast and slow WL [13–15]. Using a sub-
stantively larger sample, we demonstrate that WLR faster
than the recommended 1-2 lb/wk is associated with greater
improvements in BP [16]. However, after adjustment for the
differences in absolute WL, there were minimal differences
in the metabolic risk factor changes, with the differences
tending to be worse in the Fast WLR as compared with the
Rec WLR group. When weight loss rate was examined as a
continuous variable, we observe significantly better re-
ductions in glucose and SBP with faster WLR. Together,
these results indicate that the benefits of faster WLR on
health occur at rates slower than the recommended 1-2 lb/
wk WLR, with no additional benefits for WLR faster than the
recommended rate. Conversely, slower WLR was associated
with better improvements in HDL than the recommended 1-
2 lb/wk. However, these differences are likely not of a
magnitude that would be clinically relevant. Many of these
differences are below the measurement accuracy for these
tests and are well within the day-to-day variations expected.
Tus, our results would suggest there are minimal, if any,

 cardiometabolic benefits or consequences associated with rapid
WL after adjusting for differences in absolute weight loss.
Taken together, we conclude that absolute WL should be the
focus for improving health, and faster WLR may be an avenue
that patients may be able to attain greater weight loss and long-
term weight maintenance [6], but at the small increased risk for
gallstone formation [4]. However, if the same WL is attainable
through the recommended 1-2lb/wk WLR, then that would be
the most optimal choice for weight and health outcomes.
Strengths and limitations of the current study warrant
mention. Our study sample consisted of patients from a
publicly funded weight management clinic that was pre-
dominately middle-aged women, and the applicability of
these findings to other demographics is unclear. Te in-
dividuals included in this analysis were generally at the clinic
for less than 2 years, and thus, we are unsure of the long-term
sustainability of their WL, weight regain, or health changes.
Because of the nature of care provided at the weight
management clinic, reporting of gall stones is inconsistent,
as care would be provided at the hospital and follow-up
treatment by their primary care physician. Nevertheless, the
risk of gallstones is well documented and important to
consider. Furthermore, as only two time points were used,
we cannot speak to the influence of weight loss patterns on
the health changes; however, it is suggested that the weight
regain after fast and slow WL is similar [7, 14, 19]. Finally,
this was mainly individualized clinical weight management
care that predominately focuses on dietary interventions,
and we cannot say for certain what specific intervention
components or external factors lead to the weight or health
changes observed. However, the use of weight loss medi-
cations was adjusted for in the analyses.
In summary, we demonstrate that patients with rates of
WL faster than the commonly recommended 1-2 lb/wk
(0.45–0.91 kg/wk) tended to have greater obesity re-
duction and superior health improvements than slower WL.
However, the superior improvements in health associated
with faster WL are abolished after adjusting for absolute WL.
Faster WLRs either early in the intervention or over the
entire treatment were associated with similar changes in
metabolic health at the commonly recommended rate in
patients attending a publicly funded clinical weight man-
agement program. Tus, future WL interventions aimed at
improving metabolic health should focus on the absolute
weight loss attained and long-term weight management.
