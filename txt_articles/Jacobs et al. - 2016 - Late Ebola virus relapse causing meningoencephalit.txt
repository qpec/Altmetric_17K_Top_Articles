Summary
Background There are thousands of survivors of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa. Ebola virus can persist in 
survivors for months in immune-privileged sites; however, viral relapse causing life-threatening and potentially 
transmissible disease has not been described. We report a case of late relapse in a patient who had been treated for 
severe Ebola virus disease with high viral load (peak cycle threshold value 13·2).
Methods A 39-year-old female nurse from Scotland, who had assisted the humanitarian eff
 ort in Sierra Leone, had 
received intensive supportive treatment and experimental antiviral therapies, and had been discharged with 
undetectable Ebola virus RNA in peripheral blood. The patient was readmitted to hospital 9 months after discharge 
with symptoms of acute meningitis, and was found to have Ebola virus in cerebrospinal fl
 uid (CSF). She was treated 
with supportive therapy and experimental antiviral drug GS-5734 (Gilead Sciences, San Francisco, Foster City, CA, 
USA). We monitored Ebola virus RNA in CSF and plasma, and sequenced the viral genome using an unbiased 
metagenomic approach.
Findings On admission, reverse transcriptase PCR identifi
 ed Ebola virus RNA at a higher level in CSF (cycle threshold 
value 23·7) than plasma (31·3); infectious virus was only recovered from CSF. The patient developed progressive 
meningoencephalitis with cranial neuropathies and radiculopathy. Clinical recovery was associated with addition of 
high-dose corticosteroids during GS-5734 treatment. CSF Ebola virus RNA slowly declined and was undetectable 
following 14 days of treatment with GS-5734. Sequencing of plasma and CSF viral genome revealed only two non-
coding changes compared with the original infecting virus.
Interpretation Our report shows that previously unanticipated, late, severe relapses of Ebola virus can occur, in this 
case in the CNS. This fi
 nding fundamentally redefi
 nes what is known about the natural history of Ebola virus 
infection. Vigilance should be maintained in the thousands of Ebola survivors for cases of relapsed infection. 
The potential for these cases to initiate new transmission chains is a serious public health concern.

Introduction
There are thousands of survivors of the 2014 Ebola virus 
disease epidemic in west Africa.1 Previous Ebola 
outbreaks were much smaller and occurred in resource-
limited locations, so it would be unsurprising if the full 
range of complications has yet to be documented. 
However, the possibility of a late, severe clinical relapse 
of Ebola virus infection, with the potential for onward 
transmission, was not anticipated.
Here, we describe a case of late relapse in a patient who 
had been treated for severe Ebola virus disease with high 
viral load.
Patient history
Initial admission (December, 2014, to January, 2015)
Pauline Caff
 erkey, a 39-year-old female nurse from 
Scotland, had assisted the humanitarian eff
 ort in Sierra 
Leone, where she provided direct patient care. After her 
return to Glasgow, UK, in December, 2014, the patient 
was diagnosed with Ebola virus disease; plasma Ebola 
virus RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase PCR 
(RT-PCR),2 with a cycle threshold value of 24·8. She was 
transferred to the high-level isolation unit at the Royal 
Free Hospital, London, UK, on day 2 of her illness. She 
received intravenous fl
 uid and electrolyte replacement, 
one dose of oral brincidofovir (200 mg), and two doses of 
convalescent plasma (300 mL) on consecutive days. Her 
clinical condition deteriorated over the next 3 days, with 
type 1 respiratory failure that required continuous 
positive airway pressure ventilation, erythroderma, 
mucositis, large volume diarrhoea, and agitation. Total 
parenteral nutrition was started through a central venous 
catheter. Plasma Ebola virus RNA peaked with a cycle 
threshold value of 13·2 on day 6. Monoclonal antibody 
therapy specifi
 c for Ebola virus glycoprotein (ZMAb;3 
Public Health Agency of Canada, MB, Canada) was given 
(total dose 50 mg/kg) on days 5 and 8. Subsequently, 
plasma Ebola virus RNA declined and was lower than the

limit of assay detection by day 25. Pauline was discharged 
from hospital on day 28 with signifi
 cant fatigue and an 
ongoing hypercoaguable state with thrombocytosis, 
treated with low-molecular-weight heparin and aspirin.4
Convalescence after initial admission (January to 
October, 2015)
3 weeks after discharge, the patient had not gained 
weight and had a resting tachycardia of 110 beats per 
min; thyroid function tests confi
 rmed the clinical 
diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis (thyroxine [T4] 33·9 pmol/L 
[normal range 9–21], triiodothyronine [T3] 4·0 nmol/L 
[0·9–2·5], and suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone 
<0·01 mU/L [0·35–5]). An iodine thyroid uptake scan 
showed 
low 
uptake 
consistent 
with 
thyroiditis. 
Antithyroid peroxidase and thyroid receptor antibodies 
were negative, whereas thyroglobulin was elevated. 
Propranolol was prescribed for symptomatic control, and 
over the next 8 weeks the patient became clinically and 
biochemically euthyroid. 10 weeks after discharge, severe 
hair loss (acute telogen effl
  uvium) required prescription 
of a wig. Over the next 4 months, Pauline’s symptoms 
improved without specifi
 c treatment and she returned to 
work as a community nurse.
6 months after discharge, she developed severe bilateral 
ankle, knee, and hip pain and swelling. MRI confi
 rmed 
small bilateral ankle joint eff
 usions. Ultrasound-guided 
aspiration of the right ankle joint was planned to test for 
Ebola virus, but no eff
 usions could be detected by 
ultrasound on the day of the procedure, and aspiration 
was 
not 
attempted. 
Antinuclear 
antibodies 
and 
rheumatoid factor were negative. Ebola virus RNA was 
not detected in blood or vaginal swabs taken at this time. 
The arthralgic symptoms were controlled by non-
steroidal anti-infl
 ammatory drugs and gradually resolved 
over the following 2 months. Pauline continued working 
during this time.
Ebola virus relapse and second admission 
(October to November, 2015)
9 months after discharge, the patient developed rapid-
onset severe headache with neck pain, photophobia, 
fever, and vomiting. She was readmitted to hospital in 
Glasgow 
on 
day 
2, 
with 
worsening 
headache, 
photophobia, neck stiff
 ness, and fever up to 38·5°C. She 
was fully orientated (Glasgow Coma Scale score of 
15/15) and complete neurological examination was 
unremarkable. She had no ocular symptoms and had not 
travelled outside Europe since being discharged from 
hospital. 
Admission 
blood 
tests 
revealed 
mild 
neutrophilia and lymphopenia, and mildly raised 
C-reactive protein (fi
 gure 1). Testing for HIV infection 
was negative. Lumbar puncture showed a slightly raised 
opening pressure (24 cm H2O), but only limited analysis 
of the cerebrospinal fl
 uid (CSF) was done because of 
possible infection risk to laboratory staff
 . White blood 
cells were noted on microscopy of a fi
 xed sample of CSF, 
but were not quantifi
 ed or characterised. PCR was 
negative 
for 
Neisseria 
meningitidis, 
Streptococcus 
pneumoniae, Haemophilus infl
 uenzae, herpes simplex 
virus types 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, enterovirus, 
and parechovirus. Ebola virus RNA was detected by 
RT-PCR at a high level in CSF (cycle threshold value 
23·7) and at a much lower level in plasma (31·3). Ebola 
virus relapse causing meningitis was diagnosed and the 
patient was medically evacuated to the Royal Free 
Hospital high-level isolation unit on day 5 of illness.
Methods
Early supportive and symptomatic therapy
During the 90 min air transfer from Glasgow to London, 
the patient had two self-terminating tonic-clonic seizures. 
On arrival at the high-level isolation unit, a central venous 
catheter was inserted into the right internal jugular vein, 
and a loading dose of phenytoin was given. Regular 
levetiracetam treatment was started via a nasogastric 
tube. A urinary catheter was placed, and intravenous 
fl
 uids and enteral feeding were started. Secondary 
bacterial infection was considered due to rising peripheral 
white blood cell count and CRP (fi
 gure 1), with aspiration 
pneumonia following the seizures being a probable 
cause, and intravenous amoxicillin–clavulanic acid 
(co-amoxiclav) started. Prophylactic low-molecular-weight 
heparin was given subcutaneously.
Specifi
 c antiviral therapy
In view of detectable Ebola virus RNA in peripheral blood, 
we gave monoclonal antibody therapy specifi
 c to the Ebola 
virus glycoprotein, knowing this would not cross the 
blood–brain barrier and treat the primary condition. The 
available preparation, MIL77 (Beijing Mabworks, Beijing, 
China), was started on day 5. The intention was to give a 
total dose of 3249 mg (50 mg/kg) by slow, escalating, dose 
infusion; however, after infusion of only 60 mg, Pauline 
rapidly became pyrexial (38·7°C), tachycardic (heart rate 
150 beats per min) and hypoxaemic (SpO2 fell from 96% to 
86% on room air) with diff
 use facial and truncal erythema. 
An allergic reaction to monoclonal antibody therapy 
rechallenge was diagnosed, the infusion stopped, and 
intravenous hydrocortisone and chlorphenamine given. 
The acute symptoms resolved completely over the next 
2 h, and no further MIL77 was given.
In view of the severity of clinical illness, we started 
treatment on day 7 of illness with the experimental 
nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (Gilead Sciences, Foster City, 
CA, USA), on the basis of potent anti-Ebola virus activity in 
vitro, encouraging but scant preclinical safety data in 
humans, and successful treatment of Ebola virus infection 
in non-human primates.5 Data for drug penetration into 
the CNS were not available. Approval for emergency 
compassionate use was obtained through an established 
internal clinical review and governance process, and 
included fully informed patient consent. On the basis of 
existing preclinical data, we started treatment with a

once-daily infusion of 150 mg GS-5734 over 2 h; after the 
third infusion, this dose was increased to 225 mg in view 
of further preclinical safety data. GS-5734 treatment was 
given for a total of 14 days (fi
 gure 1). No serious adverse 
clinical or biochemical events from GS-5734 treatment 
were detected. A small rise in serum amylase was noted 
from day 5 of GS-5734 treatment, peaking at 429 IU/L 
(normal range 70–220 IU/L) 6 days later and then falling 
during continued GS-5734 treatment (fi
 gure 1).
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. All authors had full access to all the data in the 
study and the corresponding author had fi
 nal 
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
On days 5–10 of illness, the patient developed worsening 
head and thoracolumbar pain, and became progressively 
more agitated. Pain control with oxycodone and ketamine 
infusions and enteral gabapentin was only partly 
eff
 ective, and the patient required sedation with a 
propofol infusion. She developed subacute onset of 
double vision and slurred speech, in addition to 
bilateral VI, left pupillary-sparing partial III, left upper 
motor neuron VII cranial nerve palsies, and mostly left-
sided cerebellar signs. There were no long tract signs. By

day 10, Pauline had fl
 uctuating consciousness with 
hypoventilation despite cessation of sedative drugs and 
reversal of opiate eff
 ects with naloxone. Brain imaging 
was not available at this stage because of strict 
biocontainment precautions. The clinical fi
 ndings were 
compatible with skull-base leptomeningeal infl
 ammation 
with encephalitis. High-dose intravenous dexamethasone 
(8 mg immediately then 4 mg three times daily) was 
therefore started.
From day 11 to day 35, the neurological defi
 cits slowly 
improved and the steroid dose was gradually reduced. 
The patient reported dizziness, tinnitus, and reduced 
hearing in her left ear, suggesting involvement of the left 
VIII cranial nerve. Profound fatigue persisted, but 
consciousness level normalised and cranial nerve palsies 
partly resolved. Bladder voiding was impaired, and 
patchy leg weakness (particularly of left-hip fl
 exion, with 
global arefl
 exia) restricted her ability to mobilise unaided. 
Contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain and spine on day 31 
showed patchy leptomeningeal enhancement, mainly 
involving the brainstem, cranial nerves, cauda equina, 
and conus medullaris, with abnormal signal and 
enhancement within the left cerebellar hemisphere 
(fi
 gure 2). Mobility slowly improved with physiotherapy, 
and the urinary catheter was successfully removed. 
Pauline was discharged from hospital after 52 days, with 
residual weakness of the left leg and left-sided deafness.
Plasma Ebola virus RNA cycle threshold values 
 
remained remarkably constant on days 4–6 of illness, 
and then declined rapidly to lower than the detection 
limit (cycle threshold value >40; fi
 gure 1). The fi
 rst 
recorded decline, on day 7 of illness, preceded the fi
 rst 
dose of GS-5734 on the same day. CSF examinations 
were repeated on days 16 and 24 of illness; on both 
occasions, opening pressure was normal. CSF white cell 
counts were 38 × 10⁶/L on day 16 and 13 × 10⁶/L on day 24. 
Ebola virus RNA remained detectable in CSF at a low 
level (cycle threshold value 35·6) on day 16 (after 10 days 
of GS-5734 treatment), but was undetectable on day 24 
(4 days after completion of the 14 day treatment course). 
Infectious virus was recovered from the day 4 CSF, but 
not from the day 16 or day 24 samples. No infectious 
virus was detected in any blood samples (appendix).
We previously reported the full-length genomic 
sequence of the Ebola virus responsible for the patient’s 
initial illness.6 Ebola virus from CSF and plasma from 
the time of relapse was resequenced with an unbiased 
metagenomic approach to investigate the possibility of 
development of immune escape mutants in the 
intervening 10 months (appendix). However, next-
generation sequencing of plasma and CSF revealed only 
two non-coding changes, present and identical in both 
samples, compared with the original sequence from 
plasma (NCBI accession numbers KU052669 and 
KU052670; appendix). No other pathogen sequences 
were detected in CSF or blood, excluding co-infection at 
the time of Ebola virus relapse.
Circulating Ebola virus-specifi
 c antibodies were 
present following the initial illness in January, 2015, 
which persisted in convalescence. As expected, antibodies 
against Ebola virus glycoprotein, nucleocapsid protein, 
and VP40 matrix protein were present, indicating that 
despite monocolonal antibody therapy against Ebola 
virus glycoprotein the patient mounted a broad, 
endogenous humoral response. After relapse, a 
signifi
 cant anamnestic response was detected by day 9 of 
illness, with a two-log rise in total antibody titre when 
compared with convalescence. Serological assays and 
results are also described in the appendix.
Discussion
Fatigue, arthralgia, and ocular complications, including 
uveitis, are not uncommon in survivors of Ebola virus 
disease.7,8 However, the pathogenesis of post-Ebola 
complications, in particular the presence and role of viral 
persistence, is unknown. The potential for persistence in 
immune-privileged sites is inferred from prolonged 
detection of Ebola virus RNA in semen,9 and, in another 
case, Ebola virus was detected in aqueous humour 
14 weeks after initial diagnosis.10 However, to our 
knowledge, no previous reports exist of late severe 
relapses of Ebola virus with viral RNA redetected in 
blood.
In the present case, both CSF and plasma tested 
positive for Ebola virus RNA 10 months after the initial 
diagnosis. We believe that the primary site of viral relapse 
was the CNS because the clinical syndrome was 
compatible with meningoencephalitis, the level of viral 
RNA was greater in the CSF than in plasma, and 
infectious virus was recovered from the fi
 rst CSF sample. 
The CNS was probably infected at the time of original 
illness, which has been reported in another case,11 and 
persisted in this immune-privileged site. Notably, 
no neurological symptoms were reported during 
convalescence until the abrupt onset of meningitis. We 
do not know in which specifi
 c site or cells the virus 
persisted, or whether the virus continuously replicated

there or reactivated to produce clinical relapse. Sequence 
comparison at the time of initial illness and subsequent 
relapse showed no changes in coding regions, excluding 
an immune escape variant of the virus causing clinical 
relapse. A potential precipitant for relapse, such as 
intercurrent illness or use of immunosuppressive drugs, 
was not identifi
 ed, and therefore its cause and timing 
remain unexplained.
An intriguing question is why similar illness has not 
been reported among the many thousands of survivors 
in west Africa. Clinical care and follow-up of survivors 
undoubtedly needs strengthening and it is possible that 
severe Ebola virus relapses have occurred but not been 
recognised or reported. However, in survivor cohorts 
under close research surveillance, the absence of severe 
relapses suggests that they are an unusual event. It is 
plausible that patients with very high Ebola viral loads, 
such as Pauline, are most likely to have immune-
privileged sites of infection, such as the CNS, and 
therefore be at the greatest risk of relapse. Most of these 
patients would have succumbed to initial illness in west 
Africa.12,13 We also cannot discount the possibility that 
treatment during Pauline’s initial illness with passive 
immunotherapy (convalescent plasma and monoclonal 
antibody) increased the risk of subsequent CNS relapse. 
Convalescent plasma is eff
 ective in reducing mortality in 
Argentine haemorrhagic fever, caused by the Junin 
arenavirus, but its use is associated with a late 
neurological syndrome not seen in untreated patients.14,15 
Whether this late neurological syndrome is caused by 
CNS viral replication is unclear.
We treated this Ebola virus relapse fi
 rst with 
monoclonal antibody therapy. Our patient is the fi
 rst to 
be rechallenged with Ebola virus-specifi
 c monoclonal 
antibody therapy following previous treatment, and 
developed a life-threatening allergic reaction. Because 
the number of survivors who received monoclonal 
antibody treatment increased towards the latter part of 
the west Africa outbreak, recognition of the possibility of 
allergic reactions is important, although we do not yet 
know whether immunoallergic reactions to rechallenge 
are common. We subsequently used the nucleoside 
analogue GS-5734—its fi
 rst use for Ebola virus infection 
in human beings. We did not detect any serious adverse 
clinical or laboratory eff
 ects from GS-5734 treatment in 
this case. With no other cases to defi
 ne the natural history 
of untreated Ebola virus meningoencephalitis, we cannot 
know whether antiviral treatment altered the clinical 
course of disease. Topical and systemic steroids were 
used previously as part of treatment for uveitis caused by 
delayed Ebola virus relapse,10 and initiation of treatment 
with high-dose steroids in our case seemed to correlate 
with improvement in conscious level and neurological 
defi
 cits. We are unable to assess our patient’s risk of 
further Ebola virus relapse or know whether this has 
been reduced or eliminated by antiviral treatment. We 
detected a signifi
 cant anamnestic antibody response 
during her relapse. Longitudinal studies of Ebola virus in 
semen suggest that virus is gradually cleared from 
immune-privileged sites over time without specifi
 c 
treatment.9 Taken together, we deem her risk of further 
relapse to be very low, but cannot exclude the possibility 
since the cause of her fi
 rst relapse remains obscure.
A 2015 report16 describes sexual transmission of Ebola 
virus from the semen of a survivor 179 days after disease 
onset. Relapse of viral replication in the CNS alone would 
not pose a risk of onward community transmission, but 
our patient also had detectable Ebola virus RNA in blood. 
The level was much lower than in CSF, she had pre-
existing circulating antibodies against Ebola virus, and 
we were unable to recover infectious virus from any 
blood sample. Therefore, the risk of infection to other 
people was probably small, and empirically much lower 
than during primary Ebola virus disease, but cannot be 
excluded. In view of the large number of Ebola survivors 
in west Africa, the potential for relapse, even if rare, to 
initiate new transmission chains is a serious public 
health concern. A small cluster of Ebola cases occurred 
in Liberia in November, 2015, after human to human 
transmission was thought to have ended, which WHO 
has reported was the result of re-emergence of Ebola 
virus that had persisted in a previously infected 
individual.17
Ongoing vigilance by all health-care professionals for 
relapsed Ebola virus infection in survivors is essential, as 
we do not yet know the full range of clinical illnesses that 
might result. A role for antiviral treatment in survivors 
with viral persistence or identifi
 ed at greatest risk of 
relapse might need to be considered. Our case shows 
why good medical care, surveillance, and research in 
survivors should be crucial components of the global 
response to the devastating Ebola epidemic in west 
Africa.
