Abstract
Background
High body mass index (BMI) has become the leading risk factor of disease burden in high-
income countries. While recent studies have suggested that the risk of cancer related to
obesity is mediated by time, insights into the dose-response relationship and the cumulative
impact of overweight and obesity during the life course on cancer risk remain scarce. To our
knowledge, this study is the first to assess the impact of adulthood overweight and obesity
duration on the risk of cancer in a large cohort of postmenopausal women.
Methods and Findings
Participants from the observational study of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) with BMI
information from at least three occasions during follow-up, free of cancer at baseline, and
with complete covariate information were included (n = 73,913). Trajectories of BMI across
ages were estimated using a quadratic growth model; overweight duration (BMI � 25 kg/
m2), obesity duration (BMI � 30 kg/m2), and weighted cumulative overweight and obese
years, which take into account the degree of overweight and obesity over time (a measure
similar to pack-years of cigarette smoking), were calculated using predicted BMIs. Cox
proportional hazard models were applied to determine the cancer risk associated with

 overweight and obesity duration. In secondary analyses, the influence of important effect
modifiers and confounders, such as smoking status, postmenopausal hormone use, and
ethnicity, was assessed. A longer duration of overweight was significantly associated with
the incidence of all obesity-related cancers (hazard ratio [HR] per 10-y increment: 1.07,
95% CI 1.06–1.09). For postmenopausal breast and endometrial cancer, every 10-y
increase in adulthood overweight duration was associated with a 5% and 17% increase in
risk, respectively. On adjusting for intensity of overweight, these figures rose to 8% and
37%, respectively. Risks of postmenopausal breast and endometrial cancer related to over-
weight duration were much more pronounced in women who never used postmenopausal
hormones. This study has limitations because some of the anthropometric information was
obtained from retrospective self-reports. Furthermore, data from longitudinal studies with
long-term follow-up and repeated anthropometric measures are typically subject to missing
data at various time points, which was also the case in this study. Yet, this limitation was
partially overcome by using growth curve models, which enabled us to impute data at miss-
ing time points for each participant.
Conclusions
In summary, this study showed that a longer duration of overweight and obesity is associ-
ated with an increased risk of developing several forms of cancer. Furthermore, the degree
of overweight experienced during adulthood seemed to play an important role in the risk of
developing cancer, especially for endometrial cancer. Although the observational nature of
our study precludes inferring causality or making clinical recommendations, our findings
suggest that reducing overweight duration in adulthood could reduce cancer risk and that
obesity prevention is important from early onset. If this is true, health care teams should rec-
ognize the potential of obesity management in cancer prevention and that excess body
weight in women is important to manage regardless of the age of the patient.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Excess weight has become the leading risk factor for disease burden in high-income
countries and has been offsetting or surpassing the decreasing disease burden attribut-
able to tobacco smoking. Excess weight has been linked to the development of several
types of cancer.
• To date, most studies exploring the relationship between excess weight and cancer risk
looked at cross-sectional exposure information on overweight and obesity, i.e., height
and weight measured at one point in time. Insights into the dose-response relationship
of the cumulative impact of overweight and obesity during the life course on cancer risk
remain scarce.

 What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• This study examined how the timing, duration, and intensity of overweight and obesity
during adulthood impacts on cancer risk, taking into account important information on
other factors related to obesity, such as physical activity, diet, smoking, hormone use,
and diabetes history.
• A total of 73,913 women were included in the study, and 6,301 obesity-related cancers
were diagnosed during a mean follow-up of 12.6 y. About two-thirds of all included
women were ever overweight or obese during adulthood.
• The study found that being overweight for a longer duration during adulthood signifi-
cantly increased the incidence of all obesity-related cancers by 7% (for every ten-year
increase in adulthood overweight duration), of postmenopausal breast cancer by 5%,
and of endometrial cancer by 17%. After adjusting for the intensity of overweight (that
is, how overweight individuals were), these figures rose to 8% for postmenopausal breast
cancer and 37% for endometrial cancer (for every ten years spent with body mass index
ten units above normal weight).
What Do These Findings Mean?
• How much of their adult lives women are overweight and how overweight they are play
important roles in cancer risk. This finding highlights the importance of obesity preven-
tion at all ages and from early onset.
Introduction
High body mass index (BMI) has become the leading risk factor for disease burden in high-
income countries and has been offsetting or surpassing the decreasing disease burden attribut-
able to tobacco smoking [1]. In the US, currently about 70% of all adults are considered over-
weight (BMI � 25 kg/m2) and 36% obese (BMI � 30 kg/m2, according to WHO classification),
making the US one of the countries with the highest prevalence of obesity [2]. This develop-
ment has also been found to contribute substantially to the country’s poor international rank-
ing in longevity [3,4]. Continuing increases in obesity prevalence seen over the past decades
remain of great public health concern.
Overweight and obesity have been associated with an increased risk of and mortality from
cancer and other chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [5]. In the
US, more than 100,000 cancer cases were attributed to high BMI in the year 2012 alone [6].
Cancers previously linked to high BMI include postmenopausal breast cancer, adenocarcinoma
of the esophagus, and pancreatic, colorectal, renal, endometrial, ovarian, and gallbladder can-
cer [7,8]. To date, most studies of these associations have used cross-sectional exposure infor-
mation on BMI, i.e., BMI measured at one point in time and typically obtained at recruitment.
Yet, insights into the dose-response relationship of the cumulative impact of overweight and
obesity during the life course on cancer risk remain scarce. While age-dependent and cumula-
tive effects of weight change have previously been reported to affect the risk of postmenopausal

 breast cancer [9–11], only a few studies have investigated the association between overweight
duration and cancer outcomes [9,12]. It is thus still unclear how different exposure durations
of overweight and obesity are associated with cancer development.
In this study, we assessed the impact of adulthood overweight and obesity duration and
cumulative intensity on cancer risk in US women, using data from the observational study
cohort of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI). In secondary analyses, we investigated the
influence of important effect modifiers and confounders, such as smoking status, postmeno-
pausal hormone use, and ethnicity.
Methods
Ethics
WHI procedures and protocols were approved by the institutional review boards at each partic-
ipating institution, and all participants provided written informed consent.
Study Population
The WHI is a large, multi-center prospective cohort study of postmenopausal women. The
WHI was designed to have a clinical trial arm and an observational study cohort [13], and
recruited postmenopausal women aged 50–79 y at 40 clinical centers nationwide between
October 1, 1993, and December 21, 1998, to be followed for the development of diseases that
are the most common causes of death, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. Details of
the study design and methods have been published elsewhere [13–16]. In total, 93,676 women
were enrolled in the observational study, and 68,132 were enrolled in the clinical trial arm
(n = 161,808) [16]. For this study, we included all participants from the observational study
cohort, except those who reported cancer prior to or at baseline or without data on cancer his-
tory (n = 12,827) and women with incomplete follow-up information (n = 411) (Fig 1).
Anthropometric Assessment
Information on BMI for was obtained from retrospective self-reports at baseline for ages 18,
35, and 50 y, from weight and height measurements at baseline and at 3-y follow-up, and from
self-reports at follow-up years 4–8. BMI was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by
height in meters squared. For inclusion in the study, women were required to have valid body
weight information from at least three occasions and a valid baseline measurement of body
weight and height.
Covariate Assessment
Covariates included baseline information on age (continuous), ethnicity (six categories), edu-
cation (11 categories), energy intake (in kilocalories, continuous), diet quality (Alternate Medi-
terranean Diet Score [17], nine categories), physical activity (frequency of moderate exercise
per week, four categories), smoking status (never/past/current smoker), and outcome-specific
covariates—for pancreatic cancer: diabetes (never/ever diabetic); for colon cancer: diabetes and
red meat intake (servings/day); for postmenopausal breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer:
postmenopausal hormone use (never/past/current user), number of full-term pregnancies
(continuous), age at first term pregnancy (<20, 20–24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, 40–44, 45+ y),
and age at menopause (continuous).

 Case Ascertainment
Adjudication and outcome ascertainment for the WHI have been described elsewhere [18]. In
brief, all outcomes were self-reported annually in the observational study arm. Only first invasive
cancers confirmed by adjudication were included in these analyses. All analyses were conducted
for the following cancers with convincing evidence of a positive relation with excess BMI [7,8]:
colon, rectum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, postmenopausal breast, endometrium, ovary, kidney,
and thyroid, as well as the combination of all of these, termed “all obesity-related cancers.”
Statistical Analysis
The analysis was carried out in two steps. In the first step, BMI was modeled across all ages
using a quadratic growth model with random intercept and random slope, incorporating all

preceding cancer diagnosis; including BMI from self-reported as well as measured height and weight; BMI
values lower <15 or >70 kg/m2 were excluded.

 available BMI information from all included participants [19]. No random coefficient was
included for the quadratic term.
BMI information in the year preceding cancer diagnosis for those who developed an inva-
sive malignancy was excluded. This model was developed and adjusted in a stepwise manner
by adding ethnicity, education, and baseline physical activity, smoking status, energy intake,
and diet quality score to the model. Using this approach, we allowed individuals to have their
own BMI trajectory. Using the full model, BMI was predicted from age 18 y until the age at
study exit for every cohort member. The obtained predicted age-specific BMI data were
then used to compute the following parameters: overweight (BMI � 25 kg/m2) and obesity
(BMI � 30 kg/m2) duration in years and weighted cumulative overweight years (OWY) and
obese years (OBY). OWY and OBY were calculated by multiplying the duration of over-
weight and obesity in years by the difference (in BMI units) above normal BMI (�25 kg/m2)
for overweight and above overweight (�30 kg/m2) for obesity for each age. This allowed us to
take the degree of each participant’s overweight and obesity over time into account. An indi-
vidual with a BMI of 35 kg/m2 for 10 y would thus contribute 100 (= 10 × [35 − 25]) OWY
and 50 (= 10 × [35 − 30]) OBY units. The merit of this approach as a better predictor than
cross-sectional BMI information alone for many obesity-related outcomes has been described
earlier [20]. Overweight and obesity duration were assessed per 10-y increments and OWY
and OBY per 100 units.
In the second step of the analysis, Cox proportional hazard models with time since enroll-
ment as the underlying time metric were fitted to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs) for the relationship between BMI overweight/obesity duration, OWY/
OBY, and the risk of developing specific cancers. Overweight/obesity duration and OWY/OBY
were treated as continuous, time-varying covariates. Participants were censored at study exit
due to death, loss to follow-up, any cancer diagnosis, or end of follow-up (August 29, 2014),
whichever occurred first. Three models were fitted for all outcomes with adjustments for sev-
eral established risk factors for obesity-related cancers. In model 1, adjustment was made for
age. Model 2 was additionally adjusted for ethnicity and education. In model 3, smoking status,
physical activity, energy intake, and diet quality score were additionally introduced into the
model. Cancer-specific adjustments were made in model 4, introducing age at first birth, age at
menopause, parity, and postmenopausal hormone use for breast, endometrial, and ovarian
cancer; red meat intake and diabetes status for colon cancer; and diabetes status for pancreatic
cancer. Possible interactions were tested by fitting models with and without the interaction
term, and corresponding p-values were computed from likelihood ratio tests comparing the
two models. In order to assess the potentially nonlinear dose-response relationships between
overweight duration, OWY, and cancer risk, we used restricted cubic splines with three knots
to model those relationships [21]. Nonlinearity was evaluated by testing the null hypothesis
that the coefficients of the splines were the same.
In secondary analyses, we assessed a priori interactions by stratifying by postmenopausal
hormone use, hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy, ethnicity, diabetes, and smoking status. We
also tested the robustness of our findings by predicting BMI trajectories using self-reported
height and weight assessments only.
All analyses were carried out using Stata 13.
Results
The final sample for analyses included 73,913 women with a mean follow-up of 12.6 y (stan-
dard deviation [SD] = 5.1), during which a total of 6,301 invasive obesity-related cancer cases
occurred. Out of all included study participants, 40% (n = 29,770) were never overweight

 (BMI < 25 kg/m2) during their adult life (age 18 y until study exit), and 60% (n = 44,143) were
ever overweight (BMI � 25 kg/m2), almost half of whom (n = 19,654) were also ever obese
(BMI � 30 kg/m2) (Table 1). These values were estimated based on BMI data from on average
>9 occasions (both measured and self-reported) per study participant. Women who were ever
overweight were on average overweight for 31.3 y; those who were ever obese were, on average,
obese for 20.6 y. Compared with women who were never overweight, those who were ever
overweight or obese were slightly younger at baseline, had a lower education, and were more
likely to be African-American (Table 1). While no differences existed in smoking status,
women who were ever overweight or obese were less physically active, consumed more calories,
had a lower diet quality score, and more often reported ever being diabetic than women who
were never overweight. Women who were never overweight were more likely to be using post-
menopausal hormones and less often had a hysterectomy.
A longer overweight duration significantly increased the risk of all obesity-related cancers
combined (multivariable-adjusted HR per 10-y increment: 1.07, 95% CI 1.06–1.09) (Table 2).
The strongest associations were observed for endometrial (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.12–1.22) and
kidney cancer (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07–1.26), while no significant associations were found for
rectal, liver, gallbladder, pancreatic, ovarian, and thyroid cancer. When taking into account the
degree of overweight over time, the association became stronger for all obesity-related cancers
combined, with an increase in risk of 12% for every 100 units of OWY. For endometrial cancer,
the HR per 100 OWY was 1.37 (95% CI 1.29–1.46). The results for obesity duration were even
more pronounced and showed a significant association for all obesity-related cancers com-
bined (multivariable-adjusted HR per 10-y increment: 1.10, 95% CI 1.08–1.12) and individu-
ally for colon, breast, endometrial, and kidney cancer, with HRs for every 10 y of obesity
ranging from 1.07 (95% CI 1.04–1.10) for breast cancer to 1.23 (95% CI 1.18–1.28) for endome-
trial cancer. Risks associated with OBY were similar. Further cancer-specific adjustments (for
pancreatic cancer: diabetes; for colon cancer: diabetes and red meat intake; for postmenopausal
breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer: postmenopausal hormone use, number of full-term
pregnancies, age at first term pregnancy, and age at menopause) did not materially change
these results (Table A in S1 Appendix).
A dose-response relationship with increasing overweight duration was found for almost all
cancers (Fig 2). The risk of endometrial cancer associated with increasing overweight duration
rose in an exponential fashion, but became statistically significant only after 26 y of being over-
weight. This threshold effect disappeared when the degree of overweight over time was taken
into account (Fig A in S1 Appendix). In contrast, the association of overweight duration with
colon and postmenopausal breast cancer was linear.
When stratifying the analyses by postmenopausal hormone use, for which statistically sig-
nificant interactions were found, stronger associations of breast and endometrial cancer with
all measures of overweight and obesity duration emerged in women who were never or past
users (Table B in S1 Appendix). While the risk of endometrial cancer was statistically nonsig-
nificant in current users, the risk of breast cancer was still elevated in this group, although at a
much lower level than in never users (Fig 3). In line with these findings, the incidence rate of
postmenopausal breast cancer was high in women who were ever overweight, regardless of
their hormone use (Fig B in S1 Appendix). In contrast, among women who were never over-
weight in adulthood, current hormone users had a higher incidence rate of postmenopausal
breast cancer than never or past postmenopausal hormone users. This pattern was somewhat
different for endometrial cancer, where the incidence rate in ever overweight current users was
similar to that in women who were never overweight and never or past hormone users.
Similar risks of postmenopausal breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer associated with
increasing overweight and obesity duration and intensity were found in women who had ever

 had a hysterectomy or oophorectomy compared to women who never underwent either of
these procedures (Table C in S1 Appendix). Cancer risk related to increasing overweight and
obesity duration was slightly higher in non-Hispanic white women than in African-American
women for breast cancer (Table D in S1 Appendix), more pronounced in women who ever
reported diabetes for colon cancer (Table E in S1 Appendix), and highest in current smokers
compared to past and never smokers for colon and pancreatic cancer (Table F in S1 Appendix).
Additional analyses using only self-reported BMI assessments confirmed the main findings
(Table G in S1 Appendix).
Discussion
Many previous studies have reported on the association between obesity and cancer, but, to
our knowledge, this study is the first to assess the impact of adulthood overweight and obesity
duration on the risk of various types of cancer in a large cohort of postmenopausal women. We
found that longer durations of overweight and obesity were significantly associated with an
increased incidence of obesity-related cancers, postmenopausal breast cancer, and colon, endo-
metrial, and kidney cancer. Taking into account the intensity of overweight over time further
increased the risks, and clear dose-response relationships were found. These findings are in

 line with previous studies on other chronic diseases, which showed that obesity duration is an
important and independent predictor of type 2 diabetes [11], cardiovascular disease [10], and
all-cause mortality [9]. Underlying biological mechanisms explaining these associations
include a higher risk of developing hypertension and insulin resistance [10,11]. Earlier and
long-term exposure to overweight and obesity may also increase the risk and severity of
chronic inflammation, oxidative DNA damage, and alterations in endogenous hormone
metabolism, three key mechanisms that have been found to be associated with increased risk of
cancer [22].
We also observed that the risks of postmenopausal breast and endometrial cancer related to
overweight and obesity duration were modified by postmenopausal hormone use and were
largely attenuated or even eliminated among postmenopausal hormone users. Very high levels
of estrogen in women using postmenopausal hormones have been postulated to obscure the
effect of obesity and might explain this finding. While similar effect modification was reported
in earlier analyses of the WHI observational study [23,24], in the Million Women Study [25–
27], and in several other prospective cohorts [28–30], a recent analysis of the WHI clinical trial

 suggested a remaining positive association between obesity and postmenopausal cancer risk,
independent of postmenopausal hormone use [31]. This finding was attributed to the often
self-reported height, weight, and hormone use information in observational studies as well as
outcome ascertainment bias. Strong associations found for endometrial cancer and its

 exponential dose-response relationship with overweight duration and intensity confirm risk
patterns observed in previous studies [32,33].
Long-term follow-up and many repeated measurements of weight and height are necessary
in order to fully capture lifetime overweight and obesity exposure and to quantify correspond-
ing health effects. In our study, we used data from a large cohort of women with numerous
repeated measurements and self-reports of weight and height for each individual, and applied a
novel approach to estimate adulthood overweight and obesity duration. By modeling individ-
ual BMI trajectories across age using growth curves, all observed BMI information for an indi-
vidual could be used, and unbalanced repeated measurements accommodated. Compared to
traditional approaches to handling incomplete time-dependent data, such as linear interpola-
tion and last observation carried forward methods, which may not adequately model BMI tra-
jectories, growth models can incorporate any covariate data that might be important when
predicting an individual’s BMI during life course. Using this approach, we were able to quantify
the risk associated with both the duration and the intensity of overweight and obesity, as
opposed to most previous studies, which focused on cross-sectional BMI information only.
Our study has limitations because of variation in how BMI information was collected and
used. Some of this information was obtained from retrospective self-reports, which might be
subject to measurement error. Yet, including only self-reported height and weight information
when modeling BMI trajectories only marginally altered the results. Data from longitudinal
studies with long-term follow-up and repeated anthropometric measures are typically subject
to missing data at various time points due to periodical measurements, which was also the case
in this study. Using growth curve models, we were able to impute data at missing time points
for each participant. In a previous small-scale simulation study focusing on the effects of mea-
surement errors, it was reported that using predicted biomarker values from growth curve
models as a time-dependent covariate in Cox regression models—instead of applying a more
naïve approach based on periodically observed biomarker values—yielded much less biased
estimates for the association between the biomarker and the clinical outcome, especially when
the variance in measurement errors was large [34].
BMI is not an ideal measure of body fatness as it does not differentiate tissue type (fatty,
lean, bone). It has been suggested that other anthropometric measures such as waist circumfer-
ence or waist-to-hip ratio better predict obesity-related health outcomes than BMI does
[35,36]. These measures were, however, not available in a repeated fashion in the WHI. Addi-
tionally, BMI has limitations with regard to its application across different race/ethnic groups
and ages [37]. In the US, African-American and Hispanic women have been reported to be
more likely to be obese than non-Hispanic white and Asian women, while Asian women have
been shown to have a higher percentage of body fat than non-Hispanic white women at similar
BMI levels [38]. It might thus be appropriate to use different BMI thresholds for overweight
and obesity in different race/ethnic groups. In our study, the risks for postmenopausal breast
cancer associated with a longer overweight duration were higher in non-Hispanic white
women than in African-American women. The fairly small number of women with an ethnic-
ity other than non-Hispanic white did not allow further investigation of this issue. Further-
more, it is important to note that BMI serves as a proxy for many internal physiological
processes that are the actual correlates of cancer development and that these also depend on
many other lifestyle and environmental factors. Any residual confounding can therefore not be
ruled out.
In summary, this study showed that the risk of cancer associated with overweight and obe-
sity compounds over time, and a longer duration of overweight and obesity during adulthood
is associated with increased risks of several cancers. Furthermore, not only the duration but
also the degree of overweight seems to play an important role in the risk of developing cancer,

 especially for endometrial cancer. Although the observational nature of our study precludes
inferring causality or making clinical recommendations, our findings suggest that reducing
overweight duration in adulthood could reduce cancer risk. If this is true, health care teams
should recognize the potential of obesity management in cancer prevention and that excess
body weight in women is important to manage regardless of the age of the patient.
