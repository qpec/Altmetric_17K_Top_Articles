Abstract
Importance—Efforts to improve end-of-life care have focused primarily on cancer patients. High 
quality end-of-life care is also critical for patients with other illnesses.
Objective—Compare patterns of end-of-life care and family-rated quality of care for patients 
dying with different serious illnesses.
Design—Retrospective cross-sectional study.
Setting—All 146 inpatient facilities within the Veteran Affairs (VA) health system.
Participants—Patients who died in VA inpatient facilities between October 2009 and September 
2012 with clinical diagnoses categorized as: end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cancer, 
cardiopulmonary failure (congestive heart failure/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), 
dementia, frailty, or other conditions.
Main Measures—Palliative care consultation; do-not-resuscitate order; death in inpatient 
hospice; death in the intensive care unit (ICU); family-reported end-of-life care quality.

 Results—Among 57,728 decedents, approximately half of patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary 
failure or frailty received palliative care consultations (adjusted proportions 50.4%, 46.7%, and 
43.7%, respectively) versus 73.5% of cancer patients and 61.4% of dementia patients (P<.001). 
Approximately one-third of patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty (adjusted 
proportions 32.3%, 34.1%, and 35.2% respectively) died in the ICU, more than double the rates 
among cancer and dementia patients (13.4% and 8.9%, respectively) (P<.001). Rates of excellent 
end-of-life care quality reported by 34,005 decedents’ families were similar for cancer and 
dementia patients (adjusted proportions 59.2% and 59.3% [P=.61]), but lower for patients with 
ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty (54.8%, 54.8%, and 53.7%, respectively; all P≤.015 vs. 
cancer). This quality advantage was mediated by palliative care consultation, setting of death, and 
do-not-resuscitate order: adjustment for these variables rendered the relationship between 
diagnosis and overall end-of-life care quality non-significant (P=.87)
Conclusions and Relevance—Family-reported quality of end-of-life care was significantly 
better for cancer and dementia patients than for patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or 
frailty, largely due to higher rates of palliative care consultation and do-not-resuscitate orders and 
fewer ICU deaths among cancer and dementia patients. Increasing access to palliative care and 
goals of care discussions that address code status and preferred setting of death, particularly for 
patients with end-organ failure and frailty, may improve the overall quality of end-of-life care for 
Americans dying of these illnesses.
INTRODUCTION
Most individuals in the United States die of conditions other than cancer.1 Yet, historically, 
efforts to improve end-of-life care have focused primarily on cancer.2,3 More recently, there 
has been increasing recognition that high quality end-of-life care is also critical for patients 
with serious illnesses other than cancer, particularly with the aging of the U.S. population.
Few studies have compared patterns of end-of-life care and quality across different serious 
illnesses, and these studies have generally examined only a small number of diagnoses.4,5 
Researchers have found differences in care between certain diagnoses–-such as higher rates 
of mechanical ventilation among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) compared to cancer patients5—but much is still unknown. Moreover, previous work 
has typically been limited to administrative or chart review data,4–7 which do not include 
patient or family perspectives. To address these important questions, we compare quality of 
care for decedents across multiple diagnoses, the first study to do so, to our knowledge. 
Furthermore, our analysis takes advantage of a unique survey of bereaved family members. 
Such surveys can play a critical role in assessing end-of-life care quality.8–14 The aim of this 
study was to compare measures of care at the end of life and family-reported quality of care 
for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cancer, cardiopulmonary failure 
(congestive heart failure [CHF]/COPD), dementia, and frailty.

 METHODS
Data Sources and Procedures
Our data were from the Veteran Affairs (VA) Performance Reporting and Outcomes 
Measurement to Improve the Standard of Care at the End-of-life (PROMISE) Center. We 
used two data sources from PROMISE: chart review and the Bereaved Family Survey.
Chart review data for nearly every patient who died in a VA inpatient facility, including 
acute care, long-term care, and inpatient hospice were abstracted by hand prior to October 1, 
2012. Subsequently, except for setting of death, which was still abstracted by hand, data 
were derived from the VA’s Corporate Data Warehouse that integrates databases containing 
clinical and administrative information.15,16 The only ineligible Veterans were those in a VA 
inpatient facility less than 24 hours in the last month of life or who died by suicide (< 4% of 
all deaths).
The PROMISE Center also surveys patients’ families about the quality of care that their 
loved ones received in the last month of life using the Bereaved Family Survey. Human 
subjects approval was obtained from the Philadelphia VAMC institutional review board.
Study Cohort
Among 58,408 patients who died in one of the 146 VA facilities nationwide between 
October 2009 and September 2012, 655 (1.1%) patients were ineligible for our analyses due 
to missing ICD-9 data. Thus, chart review analyses included 57,753 patients. Of these, 4,331 
had incorrect contact information for their next-of-kin. This left 53,422 next-of-kin eligible 
for the Bereaved Family Survey. Of those, 34,015 completed the survey (response rate 64%). 
Survey weights (described below) could not be calculated for 10 respondents due to 
incomplete covariate data, producing a final survey cohort of 34,005 (see eMethods).
Outcomes
From chart review, we obtained several measures of care at the end of life that have been 
associated with high-quality end-of-life care: 1) palliative care consultation in the last 90 
days of life;10,17 2) do-not-resuscitate order at the time of death, which may reflect a “goals 
of care” discussion;13,18 and 3) death in a hospice/palliative care unit.19,20 We also examined 
one measure, death in the intensive care unit (ICU), associated with worse family-reported 
quality.21–25
Using the Bereaved Family Survey, we examined family members’ assessment of end-of-life 
care quality.26 Our primary measure was the family’s global rating of quality on a 5-point 
Likert scale, which we dichotomized as “excellent” versus all other categories. In a 
sensitivity analysis comparing all five ratings ranging from “poor” to “excellent” using 
ordered logistic regression, results were similar (not presented).
We also examined four questions about provider communication: “providers always listened 
to concerns”; “providers always provided desired medical treatment”; “providers always 
kept family informed”; and “providers always gave enough emotional support”, and two 
questions about the presence and frequency of pain.

 Independent Variables
Our independent variable of interest was the patient’s serious illness diagnosis, based on 
inpatient admissions in the last year of life, which likely reflects their most serious medical 
conditions near death. We used inpatient diagnoses rather than death certificate diagnoses 
since past research found the latter unreliable.27,28 Each inpatient admission was associated 
with one primary diagnosis and potentially secondary diagnoses. Patients could have 
admissions in addition to their terminal admission, each with a primary diagnosis. As in 
prior studies, we categorized patients into six mutually-exclusive diagnosis categories: (1) 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD), (2) cancer, (3) cardiopulmonary failure (CHF or COPD), 
(4) dementia, (5) frailty, and (6) other.6,7,29–31 Our approach was the following (see 
eMethods): 1) Decedents with one or more primary diagnoses for ESRD, cancer, 
cardiopulmonary failure, dementia or frailty were categorized using the above hierarchy. 2) 
For those with none of the five primary diagnoses in the last year of life, secondary 
diagnoses were examined, and decedents were categorized using the same hierarchy.6 As in 
previous work, frailty included Parkinson’s disease, stroke, hip fracture, delirium, 
pneumonia, incontinence, dehydration, leg cellulitis, or syncope. Cardiopulmonary failure 
included CHF or COPD.6
We conducted three sensitivity analyses of diagnosis assignment. In the first, we categorized 
decedents using only hospitalizations within the last month of life. In the second, we divided 
cardiopulmonary failure into CHF and COPD as separate diagnoses. In the third, we 
combined frailty and “other” diagnosis categories.
Covariates—Age, gender, race, comorbidity, and relationship of next-of-kin came from the 
VA’s Corporate Data Warehouse. Comorbidity was measured using the Deyo adaptation of 
the Charlson Comorbidity Index32 applied to inpatient ICD-9 codes (see eMethods). The 
unweighted number of comorbidities was categorized as: none, 1–3 comorbidities, and ≥4 
comorbidities.33,34
Statistical Analysis and Survey Weights
To compare measures of care and family ratings of end-of-life care quality among decedents 
with different serious illnesses, we used the Pearson Χ2 test to examine unadjusted 
associations and multivariable logistic analyses adjusted for decedent age, race, gender, 
relationship of next-of-kin, and comorbidity. We used generalized estimating equations to 
adjust standard errors for clustering of patients within facilities. We report adjusted 
proportions for each outcome by diagnosis and P-values both for the overall association of 
diagnosis with each dependent variable and for the comparison of each diagnosis versus 
cancer.
We next assessed whether the association between diagnosis and family-reported quality was 
mediated by differences across diagnoses in measures of end-of-life care. After documenting 
the association between diagnosis and these measures (palliative care consultation, do-not-
resuscitate order, and setting of death) and between these measures and family-reported 
quality, we added these three variables to the models assessing associations between 
diagnosis and family-reported quality. We included all settings of death (ICU, hospital non-

 ICU, nursing home, inpatient hospice) because of the important role that setting can play in 
end-of-life care. In sensitivity analyses we also examined the association between diagnosis 
and each outcome stratified by setting of death.
Missing covariate and chart review outcomes data were infrequent (<0.1%). The 25 patients 
with missing covariate data were excluded from models. Missing survey outcomes data were 
also infrequent (<4% for each outcome, except frequent uncontrolled pain [14%]).
We adjusted for nonresponse in the Bereaved Family Survey using inverse probability 
weights. Specifically, after fitting a logistic regression model predicting survey completion 
that included all covariates described above, we calculated a weight for each decedent equal 
to the reciprocal of the probability of that decedent’s family member completing the survey.
RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
Table 1 presents demographic and clinical characteristics by diagnosis for the full cohort. 
Decedents with dementia, cardiopulmonary failure, and frailty were older than decedents in 
other diagnosis groups. A higher proportion of decedents with ESRD were African-
American (30%) compared with other diagnosis groups (range 13–19%). Decedents with 
ESRD had the greatest comorbid disease burden. The characteristics of patients whose 
families completed the Bereaved Family Survey are presented in eTable 1. Compared with 
this group, decedents whose families did not respond to the survey were younger and more 
likely to be African-American.
End-of-Life Care Outcomes
Table 2 shows the adjusted proportions of each dependent variable by diagnosis (see eTable 
2 for unadjusted proportions). For all outcomes, both unadjusted and adjusted proportions 
differed significantly by diagnosis (P≤.003 for all models).
The upper half of Table 3 shows that, in adjusted analyses, only half of ESRD patients and 
less than half of cardiopulmonary failure or frailty patients received palliative care 
consultations in the last 90 days of life (adjusted proportions 50.4%, 46.7%, and 43.7%, 
respectively). In contrast, 73.5% of cancer patients and 61.4% of dementia patients received 
such consultations. Approximately one-third of patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary 
failure, and frailty (adjusted proportions 32.3%, 34.1%, and 35.2%, respectively) died in the 
ICU, compared with 13.4% and 8.9% among cancer and dementia patients, respectively. 
Conversely, 42.9% of cancer patients and 32.3% of dementia patients died in inpatient 
hospice units, versus less than a quarter of ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, and frailty 
patients (adjusted proportions 24.3%, 22.9%, and 20.3%). Cancer and dementia patients had 
higher rates of do-not-resuscitate orders at the time of death (adjusted proportions 95.3% 
and 93.5%) than patients with ESRD (87.0%), cardiopulmonary failure (86.3%), or frailty 
(88.6%). For each outcome, pairwise comparisons between cancer and other diagnoses were 
significant (P<.003).

 The lower half of Table 3 shows that rates of family-reported excellent overall end-of-life 
care quality were similar for cancer and dementia patients (adjusted proportions 59.2% and 
59.3% P=.61), but were lower, relative to cancer, for patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary 
failure, or frailty (54.8%, 54.8%, and 53.7%, respectively; all P≤.015).
Family members’ evaluation of provider communication followed a similar pattern. 
However, among the 81.7% of decedents who had pain (based on family report), the 
proportion with frequent uncontrolled pain did not differ significantly among cancer, ESRD, 
cardiopulmonary failure, and frailty patients (adjusted proportions 55.0%, 54.3%, 55.9%, 
and 53.3%, respectively) but was significantly lower among dementia patients (49.4%, P<.
001 compared with cancer).
Setting of death, palliative care consultation, and do-not-resuscitate order at death were all 
independently associated with family-reported overall quality of end-of-life care (P≤.001) 
and with several other family-reported quality measures. Adjusting for these variables 
attenuated the association between diagnosis and overall family rating of care, rendering the 
relationship non-significant (P=.87) (Table 3). In sensitivity analyses stratified by setting of 
death, there was no longer a significant association between diagnosis and family-reported 
overall quality of end-of-life care for any setting. However, differences by diagnosis in rates 
of palliative care consultation and DNR orders remained significant for three of the four 
settings (ICU, hospital non-ICU, and nursing home) (results not shown).
A sensitivity analysis assigning decedents to diagnosis categories based on hospitalizations 
in the last month of life produced estimates very similar to our main findings (eTable 3). 
Analyses with cardiopulmonary failure examined as CHF and COPD separately suggested 
that COPD tended to have better end-of-life care quality outcomes than CHF, but left other 
findings largely unchanged (results not shown). Sensitivity analyses combining frailty with 
“other” also produced very similar results to our primary analyses (results not shown).
DISCUSSION
In a large national cohort of nearly all patients dying in VA inpatient facilities, we observed 
important differences in the end-of-life care received by individuals with different illnesses. 
Overall, we found that diagnosis was significantly associated with the quality of end-of-life 
care as measured both by family surveys and by several established measures of end-of-life 
care quality.10,17,18,21–25,35–39 Patients with end-organ failure and frailty generally received 
lower quality end-of-life care than patients with cancer or dementia.
Specifically, individuals with end-organ failure were less likely than those with cancer or 
dementia to receive palliative care consultation or have do-not-resuscitate orders, two 
measures associated with high-quality end-of-life care.10,17,18,35–39 Consistent with prior 
work comparing COPD and cancer,5 we found that patients with end-organ failure or frailty 
were more likely than patients with cancer and dementia to die in the ICU, a measure of 
end-of-life treatment intensity associated with poor symptom control and bereavement 
outcomes.10,21–25,40 Conversely, death in a hospice unit–the inpatient setting with the 
highest family-reported quality13–was more common among cancer and dementia patients

 than those with end-organ failure or frailty. Finally, overall quality of end-of-life care was 
rated more favorably by family members of cancer and dementia patients than by those of 
patients with end-organ failure or frailty. These findings suggest a need for greater attention 
to diagnosis-related disparities in the quality of end-of-life care.
What factors explain these differences in end-of-life care across conditions? We found that 
the observed differences by diagnosis in setting of death, palliative care consultation, and 
do-not-resuscitate orders mediated most of the diagnosis-related variation in family-reported 
end-of-life care quality. Our analysis stratified by setting of death also emphasize that the 
setting of end-of-life care is a key driver of the differences in quality by diagnosis. These 
results suggest several actionable steps that may improve disparities in overall quality of 
end-of-life care, such as increasing access to palliative care and inpatient hospice for patients 
with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, and frailty, and increasing goals of care discussions 
that address code status and preferred setting of death for patients with these conditions.
Another potential contributor to our findings could be diagnosis-related differences in 
patient and/or family preferences. However, we found that the groups of patients who were 
less likely to receive palliative care consultation, less likely to have a do-not-resuscitate 
order, and more likely to die in the ICU–namely those with end-organ failure or frailty–also 
had lower rates of families reporting that their providers offered the medical treatment that 
the patient and family wanted. This is more consistent with the notion that some diagnosis 
groups experience a greater mismatch between the care they receive and their underlying 
preferences, rather than diagnosis groups exhibiting sharp differences in preferences.
Our findings may also reflect differences in perceptions regarding the treatability of different 
serious conditions and the reversibility of their associated acute complications. For instance, 
patients with end-organ failure often have a clinical trajectory marked by acute 
exacerbations that are temporarily responsive to interventions.7,29 But when these 
interventions are no longer beneficial, it can be a difficult transition for patients, families, 
and providers. Therefore, differences in quality by diagnosis may reflect a failure to accept 
impending death and de-escalate aggressive treatment in conditions characterized by chronic 
progressive end-organ failure. Although measures of treatment intensity have been used to 
assess quality in oncology,41 the frequency of high-intensity care for patients with end-organ 
failure in our study suggests potential for use of these as quality measures among patients 
dying of other conditions as well.
Another important finding was the high prevalence of pain among inpatient decedents. More 
than three-quarters of patients had pain in the last month of life, over half of whom had 
frequent uncontrolled pain, similar to results of a recent study among community-dwelling 
adults near the end of life.30 Our finding that patients with end-organ failure and frailty had 
similar rates of frequent, uncontrolled pain as cancer patients (a group generally appreciated 
to be at high risk for pain) suggests another opportunity to improve care. The lower rates of 
uncontrolled pain in dementia patients must be viewed with caution since pain is often 
under-appreciated in this population, even by family members.42

 The strengths of our study include a large national cohort with a rich set of outcomes on 
end-of-life care from both chart review and a family survey, and–-to our knowledge–-one of 
the most comprehensive assessments to date of the quality of end-of-life care received by 
patients with different serious illnesses. Our study builds on past work on the quality of care 
provided to hospitalized patients at the end of life43 (the most common setting of death 
nationally44,45) by also including the growing number of patients dying in nursing homes 
and inpatient hospice.5 Our finding that measures of end-of-life care and family evaluations 
of care were similar for patients with dementia as for cancer patients is novel, and suggests 
that the substantial body of research aimed at improving end-of-life care for dementia 
patients may be having an impact.46–48
Nonetheless, our study has several limitations. First, while previous studies have 
documented the value of classifying patients near the end of life into mutually exclusive 
diagnosis groups,6,7,29 there are challenges in doing so. Using mutually exclusive diagnosis 
groups does not address multi-morbidity. We adjusted for comorbidity in our models; 
however, the end-of-life care experience for patients with multiple conditions could differ 
substantially from the experiences of those with one condition. Defining frailty is 
particularly difficult, especially using administrative data,29 since frailty can exist along with 
other conditions and may reflect substantial clinical heterogeneity. Results were very similar 
when combining “frailty” into the broader group of “other” conditions. Second, our findings 
may not generalize to patients outside of the VA, though some research comparing end-of-
life care quality between VA and non-VA health care facilities suggests care may be 
similar.49 Furthermore, this rich VA data source allowed for a more robust assessment of 
end-of-life care across multiple diagnoses than has otherwise been possible. Third, while our 
survey response rate was high (64%), nonresponse bias is possible. We attempted to 
minimize this by adjusting survey analyses for nonresponse. Fourth, while examining the 
timing of do-not-resuscitate orders and palliative care consultations relative to death would 
be informative, such information was unavailable. Finally, while past research documents 
that patient-family member agreement is high for quality of care ratings, it is lower for 
ratings of subjective symptoms,50 which could affect the validity of our pain-related 
analyses.
In conclusion, while there is room for improvement in end-of-life care across all diagnoses, 
family-reported end-of-life care quality was significantly better for cancer and dementia 
patients than for patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty. This quality 
advantage was mediated by palliative care consultation, do-not-resuscitate order, and setting 
of death. Increasing access to palliative care and increasing goals of care discussions that 
address code status and preferred setting of death, particularly for patients with end-organ 
failure and frailty, may improve the quality of end-of-life care for Americans dying with 
these conditions.
