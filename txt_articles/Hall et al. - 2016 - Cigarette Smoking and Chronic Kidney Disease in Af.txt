Background-—Controversy exists regarding the association of cigarette smoking and renal dysfunction, particularly among African
Americans, who are disproportionately affected by chronic kidney disease; therefore, we evaluated the relationship between
cigarette smoking and rapid renal function (RRF) decline in the Jackson Heart Study.
Methods and Results-—Rates of RRF decline were determined among 3648 African American participants enrolled at baseline in
the Jackson Heart Study. RRF decline was defined as an absolute decline of estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30% from visit 1
to visit 3. There were 422 current, 659 past, and 2567 never smokers identified at visit 1. After adjustment for age, sex, body mass
index, diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol, physical activity, education, alcohol consumption, and prevalent cardiovascular disease,
current smokers demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of RRF decline compared with never smokers (incidence rate ratio
1.83, 95% CI 1.31–2.56). Current smokers using 1 to 19 and ≥20 cigarettes daily had an increased incidence of RRF decline
(incidence rate ratios of 1.75 [95% CI 1.18–2.59] and 1.97 [95% CI 1.17–3.31], respectively). There was a significant, progressive
reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate from visit 1 to visit 3 in current and past smokers compared with never smokers.
Finally, current smokers had a 1.38-fold increase in C-reactive protein compared with never smokers, after controlling for
covariates.
Conclusions-—In a large African American cohort, current cigarette smoking was independently associated with RRF decline in a
dose-dependent manner. There was also evidence of increased inflammation (C-reactive protein) in current smokers, suggesting a
potential mechanism for these relationships. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:e003280 doi: 10.1161/JAHA.116.003280)

E
nd-stage renal disease disproportionately affects African
Americans, who have 4 times greater risk compared
with white Americans.1 The disparity has been largely
attributed to higher rates of hypertension, obesity, and
diabetes.2 Cigarette smoking may also be an independent
risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD).3 Cardiovascular
and renal diseases are closely linked, and there is abundant
evidence that smoking accelerates adverse effects on the
cardiovascular system.4,5
Although recent evidence suggests cigarette smoking may
have detrimental effects on renal function,6 this has not been
adequately studied, especially in African American popula-
tions. Because African Americans are more likely to develop
advanced renal dysfunction and known risk factors such as
hypertension and diabetes7 than their white counterparts,
they may be more susceptible to the potential adverse renal
effects of cigarette smoking. Nevertheless, few data are
available on the effects of cigarette smoking on renal function
in African Americans. The objective of this study was to
evaluate the relationship of cigarette smoking and renal
function in participants of the Jackson Heart Study, a large
African American cohort.

 and includes 5301 participants aged 21 to 84 years. Partic-
ipants were recruited from the tricounty area surrounding
Jackson, Mississippi, and were evaluated at baseline from
2000 to 2004. Data were collected for 3 participant
examinations and were completed by visit 3 (V3), from
2009 to 2012. The present analysis includes participants
(n=3648) with serum creatinine measurements at visit 1 (V1)
and V3 to assess renal function and excludes participants
with dialysis reported at either V1 or V3 (n=32).
The study was approved by the institutional review board
at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. Each partic-
ipant provided written informed consent. The baseline exam-
ination (V1) included a home interview, self-administered
questionnaires, and a clinic visit that included blood and urine
collection. Each participant was asked to fast overnight before
the clinic visit at which blood pressure and anthropometric
measurements were obtained. Blood and urine samples were
collected according to the National Committee for Clinical
Laboratory standards, as reported previously.8
Study Variables
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was assessed using
the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-
EPI) equation9 in which the serum creatinine measurements
at V1 were optimally calibrated using a Deming regression
model, as described previously.10 Rapid renal function (RRF)
decline was defined as an absolute decrease of ≥30% in
estimated GFR from V1 to V3.11,12
Cigarette smoking status was obtained via questionnaire.
Participants who smoked >400 cigarettes in their lifetime
were defined as ever smokers. Participants who gave a
positive response to the question, “Do you now smoke
cigarettes?” were classified as current smokers. Those who
responded negatively to these questions were classified as
never smokers. Participants who were classified as ever
smokers who no longer smoked at the time of the examina-
tion were classified as past smokers. Further information
related to number of cigarettes smoked daily was also
collected.
Age, sex, and anthropometric data such as body mass
index were recorded at the baseline examination of the
Jackson Heart Study. Hypertension was defined as blood
pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg or use of blood pressure–lowering
medication, and diabetes was defined as fasting glucose
≥126 mg/dL or hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5% or use of diabetic
mediation within 2 weeks prior to the clinic visit.8 In addition,
total cholesterol was measured from plasma with the use of a
cholesterol oxidase method (Roche Diagnostics) on a Roche
COBAS FARA centrifugal analyzer, and serum C-reactive
protein (CRP) was measured by the latex particle immunotur-
bidimetric assay (Roche Diagnostics).
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4
software (SAS Institute). All P values were 2-tailed, and a
P
value
<0.05
was
considered
statistically
significant.
Baseline characteristics were compared with chi-square
tests or 1-way ANOVA for the differences among never,
past, and current smokers. Poisson regression models were
performed
for
univariate
and
multivariate
analyses
to
estimate the association between smoking status at V1
and RRF decline from V1 to V3 and to yield incidence rate
ratios (IRRs) and 95% CIs. CRP values were transformed
using natural logarithms to approximate normal distributions.
Univariate and multivariate linear regression were used to
model smoking status-log-CRP relations in Jackson Heart
Study participants.
Results
Overall, 3648 of 5301 participants had creatinine measures at
V1 and V3 and were included in our analyses. There were 422
participants identified as current smokers and 659 partici-
pants identified as past smokers; 2567 participants were
identified as never smokers. Baseline characteristics subdi-
vided by smoking status are listed in Table 1. Current
smokers were more likely to be male (P<0.001) compared
with never smokers and were likely to be younger (P<0.001)
than past smokers. Body mass index was lower in current
smokers (P<0.001), who had lower rates of hypertension
(P<0.001) and diabetes (P<0.001) than past smokers and
higher prevalent cardiovascular disease at V1 (P<0.001) than
never smokers. Current smoking was also associated with
more alcohol consumption (P<0.001) and less physical
activity (P=0.007).
Current Cigarette Smoking Is Associated With
More RRF Decline
After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, diabetes,
hypertension, and total cholesterol, current smokers demon-
strated a significantly higher incidence of RRF (IRR 1.86, 95%
CI
1.35–2.56)
decline
compared
with
never
smokers
(Table 2). Further analyses (Model 4) were performed with
the addition of physical activity, education, alcohol con-
sumption in the past 12 months, and prevalent cardiovas-
cular disease at V1 in the models, and a similar increased
IRR was observed for RRF decline in current smokers
compared with never smokers (IRR 1.83, 95% CI 1.31–2.56).
There was a significant progressive reduction in estimated
GFR from V1 to V3 in current, past, and never smokers

 Dose-Dependent Relationship Between Cigarette
Smoking and Incidence of RRF Decline
After subdividing current smokers into those who smoked 1
to 19 and ≥20 cigarettes daily, there was an increased rate of
RRF decline in both groups. The rate was higher as daily
cigarette use increased (Table 2) (IRR 1.75, 95% CI 1.18–2.59
and IRR 1.97, 95% CI 1.17–3.31 for 1–19 and ≥20 cigarettes
daily, respectively).
Current Smoking Is Associated With Increased
Systemic Inflammation
High-sensitivity CRP was assessed at V1 for all participants.
After adjustment for covariates, natural log–transformed CRP
values were analyzed with the linear regression model to
determine the effect of current and past smoking on CRP
levels. Current smokers had 1.38-fold higher CRP levels
compared with never smokers, and past smokers had 1.10-
fold higher CRP levels after controlling for covariates
(Table 3). This relationship was also dose dependent because
number of cigarettes smoked daily was associated with higher
CRP levels after controlling for covariates.
Discussion
Findings of this study from a large African American cohort
show that current cigarette smoking is associated with an
increased incidence of RRF decline compared with never
smoking. Furthermore, daily cigarette exposure was dose-
dependently associated with an increased incidence of RRF
decline. Current smoking was also associated with elevated
CRP levels, suggesting that inflammation may contribute to
renal dysfunction.
In a cross-sectional analysis of 7476 participants from the
PREVEND (Prevention of REnal and Vascular ENd stage
Disease) study, investigators found that current smokers had
more albuminuria than nonsmokers. In participants who
smoked >20 cigarettes daily, there were dose-dependent
associations between smoking and high normal albuminuria
(relative risk 1.33), elevated GFR (relative risk 1.82), and
decreased GFR (relative risk 1.53).13 In a study of >65 000
Norwegians followed for a median of 10.3 years, former and
current smoking were significantly associated with the risk of
kidney failure compared with never smoking (hazard ratios of
3.32 and 4.01, respectively).14 In a retrospective case–control
study of 4142 nondiabetic participants (aged >65 years) of
the Cardiovascular Health Study Cohort, there was an
increased risk of serum creatinine rise (0.3 mg/dL) with
increased tobacco usage, suggesting a dose-dependent effect
of cigarette smoking; however, only �3% of the studied
population experienced an increase in serum creatinine over
the 3-year time period.15 In a large prospective study of
23 534 men and women from Washington County, Maryland,
followed for 20 years, current smoking was significantly
associated with risk of CKD in both men and women (hazard
ratio of 2.6 for the total population) and accounted for 31% of
the attributable risk of CKD in this population.16 A major
drawback of this study is that 99% of participants were white.
Our findings corroborate the association between current
cigarette smoking and an increased risk of CKD observed in
other populations. To our knowledge, this analysis is the first

 reported from a prospective study of African American
participants to evaluate this dose-response relationship.
African Americans are disproportionately affected by CKD.1
This disparity has been attributed to higher rates of hyper-
tension and diabetes in African Americans compared with
white Americans, but it appears that other unexplained
factors may play a role. Because African Americans may be
predisposed to develop renal dysfunction and have higher
incidence of known CKD risk factors such as hypertension
and diabetes, they may be more susceptible to the adverse
effects of cigarette smoking, especially if smoking interacts
synergistically with these known risk factors.
We assessed the relationship between cigarette smoking
and a commonly measured inflammatory marker, CRP, to
determine possible mechanisms by which smoking may cause
renal dysfunction. Both current and past smoking were
associated with higher CRP levels. Several large cohort
studies including the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort
(CRIC), the Framingham Offspring cohort, and the Multi-Ethnic
Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) have demonstrated a
negative association between CRP and renal function.17–19
Our findings build on these studies by demonstrating a
positive relationship between cigarette smoking exposure and
levels of CRP. Inflammation may mediate the effect of
smoking to cause renal dysfunction. Some of the potential
mechanisms by which inflammation may contribute to renal
dysfunction include increased oxidative stress, endothelial
dysfunction, and atherogenesis.20–22 Further studies are
needed to determine whether inflammatory markers such as
CRP are helpful in predicting which patients who smoke are at
increased risk of kidney damage and should be considered for
therapies such as statin drugs in addition to recommending
smoking cessation.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion,
17.5%
of
African
Americans
smoke
cigarettes.23
Although African Americans are less likely to smoke com-
pared with white Americans, metabolism of substances in
cigarettes differs in African Americans compared with other
ethnic groups.24 Specifically, differences in CYP2A6 enzyme
activity, nicotine and cotinine glucuronidation, and cotinine
clearance have been reported in African Americans compared
with white Americans.25,26 Cotinine clearance significantly
influences the metabolism of nicotine to cotinine, and
Benowitz et al reported that it is 25% lower in African
Americans. In addition, the flavoring additive menthol mod-
erately inhibits CYP2A6-mediated nicotine metabolism,27 and

 menthol
cigarettes
are
popular
with
African
American
cigarette smokers.28,29 Menthol cigarette use has been
associated with increased concentrations of blood cadmium,
and exposure to low levels of cadmium has been associated
with renal tubular damage.30,31
Our study has several key strengths. To our knowledge,
this is the first prospective study to demonstrate a dose
relationship between cigarette smoking and renal function
decline in a large African American cohort. As discussed, this
is important because of the prevalence of smoking among
African Americans and their higher rates of CKD and end-
stage renal disease. Renal function was assessed using the
CKD-EPI equation instead of the Modification of Diet in Renal
Disease equation. The CKD-EPI equation has been shown to
be a better predictor of renal disease risk compared with the
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation and appears to
be more accurate for African Americans.32 We also demon-
strated a potential mechanism by which cigarette smoke may
contribute to renal dysfunction.
Our study has a few limitations. The type of cigarettes that
the participants smoked was not available for analysis. We
currently do not have levels of cotinine available to directly
measure cigarette smoking exposure. In addition, GFR was
estimated based on serum creatinine levels instead of direct
measurements such as iothalamate clearance; however, this
is an inherent limitation of most large prospective studies.
Nicotine has also been associated with hyperfiltration, which
makes interpretation of renal function more difficult. We
observed higher baseline estimated GFR in current smokers,
consistent with previous observations.13,33 Given this con-
founding observation, we used the rate of renal decline as a
marker of cigarette smoking–induced renal dysfunction.
Pinto-Sietsma and colleagues observed both decreased and
increased estimated GFR in smokers.13 They hypothesized
this may be related to smoking-induced renal hypoperfusion
and
glomerular
damage
with
compensatory
glomerular
hypertrophy and hyperfiltration. Others have suggested that
smoking-induced renal injury may follow a pattern similar to
obesity-induced renal dysfunction, which is often initially
associated with glomerular hyperfiltration.33 Finally, our data
were obtained from an African American cohort and may not
be generalizable to other ethnic groups.
Cigarette smoking is a widely recognized risk factor for
cardiovascular disease, and aggressive antismoking cam-
paigns have been successful in increasing awareness of this
relationship. The detrimental effects of cigarette smoking on
kidney disease are less well established, and there is
subsequently less emphasis placed on tobacco cessation for
renal patients without overt cardiovascular disease. Our data
show that current cigarette smoking is independently asso-
ciated with RRF decline in a large African American cohort,
and this relationship is dose dependent. There was also
evidence of increased inflammation (CRP) in current smokers,
suggesting a potential mechanism for these relationships.
Based on these observations, cigarette smoking should be
considered as a strong risk factor for renal dysfunction and
CKD, and smoking cessation should be recommended for
current cigarette smokers, particularly those with risk factors
for CKD.
