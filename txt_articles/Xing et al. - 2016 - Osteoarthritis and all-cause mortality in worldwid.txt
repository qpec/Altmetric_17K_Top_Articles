Osteoarthritis and all-cause 
mortality in worldwide populations: 
grading the evidence from a meta-
analysis
 Dan Xing*, Yuankun Xu*, Qiang Liu, Yan Ke, Bin Wang, Zhichang Li & Jianhao Lin
The objective of this study is to investigate the association between osteoarthritis (OA) and all-cause 
mortality in worldwide populations and to develop recommendations according to GRADE evidence 
levels. Literature search through Nov 2015 was performed using the electronic databases (including 
MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBSCO and Cochrane library). The prospective cohort trials that investigated the 
association between the symptomatic OA (SxOA) or radiological OA (ROA) and all-cause mortality 
were identified. Hazard ratios (HR) of all-cause mortality in patients with RxOA or ROA were pooled 
respectively. The evidence quality was evaluated using the GRADE system, while the recommendations 
were taken according to the quality. Nine of the published literature met the eligible criteria. Meta-
analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in the association between SxOA and all-cause 
mortality (HR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.68–1.23) and between ROA and all-cause mortality (HR = 1.13, 95% CI: 
0.95–1.35). The overall GARDE evidence quality was very low, which will lower our confidence in taking 
recommendations. To summarize, there was no reliable and confident evidence existed currently in 
respect of the association between OA and all-cause mortality. Due to the very low level of evidence 
quality currently, high-quality studies are still required.
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disease with rising prevalence, which results in cause of disability among the 
older people1–3. In epidemiology, half of the world’s population aged 65 years or older has OA, which is the most 
prevalent disorder of articulating joints in humans. It is commonly believed that OA rarely associated with mor-
tality in the elderly and is often considered a physiological condition of ageing4. Thus, all-cause mortality had not 
been a major area of investigation in OA. However, more attention was paid to the association between OA and 
risk of all-cause mortality recently5,6.
Although several studies were conducted to validate whether OA is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, there is 
still in controversy. Nuesch et al.7 reported that all-cause mortality was found among subjects surveyed from the 
general population with symptomatic hip or knee OA (SxOA). However, Liu and colleagues examined all-cause 
mortality in persons with SxOA using data from the Genetics ARthrosis and Progression (GARP) study and 
Osteoarthritis Care Clinic (OCC) study. The result showed that patients with OA are not at higher risk of death 
than the general population8. Our previous study demonstrated that knee SxOA was associated with an signifi-
cantly increased risk of all-cause mortality among the people in the rural areas of China and no such association 
was observed for radiological knee OA (ROA)6.
As mentioned above, whether or not OA is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality is still con-
flicting. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to assess the evidence from relevant studies that examine 
the relation between OA and risk of all-cause mortality in worldwide populations by meta-analysis approach and 
to develop recommendations according to GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, 
and Evaluation) system9,10.

Material and Methods
Literature search strategy. 
To assemble all of the potential published studies, Electronic databases includ-
ing MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBSCO and Cochrane library were searched for all studies published between JAN 
1980 and Nov 2015 that investigate the relationship between OA and all-cause mortality in populations. The 
following MeSH items or free words were taken to balance the search sensitivity and specificity: osteoarthritis, 
risk, mortality, all-cause mortality, and death rates. Gray studies were identified from the reference of included 
literature through the manual review. Articles published in languages other than English were also excluded.
Inclusive and exclusive criteria. 
Primary studies were considered eligible for inclusion if they met the 
following criteria:
(1) Study design was a prospective cohort study;
(2) Studies were included if they investigated the association between the RxOA or ROA and risk of all-cause 
mortality. SxOA was defined if both pain and ROA were present at the joints;
(3) The outcome was all-cause mortality;
(4) The hazard ratio (HR) or risk ratio (RR) and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were 
reported.
No available data, duplicate studies, reviews, rheumatoid arthritis concerned and non-comparable studies 
were excluded.
Study selection. 
Two reviewers (D.X. and Q.L.) independently screened the titles and abstracts for the eligi-
bility criteria. Subsequently, the full text of the studies that potentially met the inclusion criteria were read and the 
literature was reviewed to determine the final inclusion. Any disagreement was resolved by reaching a consensus 
through discussion.
Date extraction. 
Two researchers (D.X. and K.Y.X.) independently extracted the data from each included 
literature by the use of a standard data extraction form. The following items were extracted: title, authors, study 
design, follow-up duration, sample size, age, country, anatomy location, covariates adjusted and all-cause mor-
tality parameters.
Outcomes. 
The pooled hazard ratios of all-cause mortality in patients with RxOA or ROA were the outcomes 
of the present study.
Assessment of methodological quality. 
The quality assessment of the included studies was inde-
pendently conducted by two authors (D.X. and Y.K.X). Disagreements were resolved by discussion or consen-
sus. The methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa form11, which was a valid instrument 
designed to assess the quality of cohort studies. The Newcastle-Ottawa form assigns a maximum of four points for 
selection, two points for comparability and three points for exposure or outcome. Newcastle-Ottawa form scores 
of 7 were considered as high-quality studies and of 5–6 as moderate quality11.
Data analysis. 
Pooling data was analyzed by STATA 12.0 (Statacorp, college station, Tex). The assessment 
for statistics heterogeneity was estimated depending on chi-square and I-square test. When the chi-square was 
p > 
 0.05, or I-square < 20% indicating low statistical heterogeneity, a fixed effect model was applied. A random 
effect model was taken when chi-square was p < 
 0.05, and I-square 
  > 20%. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis 
was carried out by removing one study in each turn, the rest of the studies were analyzed to evaluate whether the 
results were affected statistically significantly. HR and 95% CI were used to measure the association between OA 
and all-cause mortality for all studies. If included studies reported several multivariable-adjusted HR, we used the 
most fully adjusted for potential confounders in the present meta-analysis. RR was used as substitute of HR, when 
some studies did not directly report HR12. A P-value < 
  0.05 was considered statistically significant. Publication 
bias was conducted statistically via Begg funnel plots, which measures the degree of funnel plot asymmetry13,14.
GRADE Evidence synthesis. 
The levels of evidence quality were estimated according to the guidelines of 
the GRADE working group9. Although the GRADE system acknowledges the primacy of randomized controlled 
trials, it also recognizes circumstances in which observational studies generate high quality evidence of treatment 
effects15. A sequential assessment of the evidence quality was applied in GRADE system, and a subsequent judg-
ment on the strength of the recommendations is followed by previous evidence quality assessment. The evidence 
grades are classified into the four categories: (1) high grade: further research is unlikely to change confidence in 
the effect estimate; (2) moderate grade: further research is likely to alter confidence in the effect estimate and may 
change the estimate; (3) low grade: further research is likely to significantly alter confidence in the effect estimate 
and to change the estimate; and (4) very low grade: any effect estimate is uncertain. The lowest evidence quality 
for any of the outcomes was used to rate the overall evidence quality according to the GRADE working group. The 
strengths of the recommendations were taken according to the overall evidence quality. GRADEpro Version 3.6 
software was used in grading evidence and taking recommendations.
Results
Literature search. 
A total of 414 titles and abstracts were preliminarily identified with the first search strat-
egy, of which 9 of the published literature6–8,16–21 ultimately met the eligibility criteria (Fig. 1). One of the included 
literatures contained two trials based on two patients’ databases respectively. All of the included studies investi-
gated the association between the SxOA/ROA and all-cause mortality.

Study characteristics. 
The characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Table 1. The individ-
ual sample sizes ranged from 181 to 1670 patients with OA. The mean follow-up ranged from 3.9 to 21 years. Six 
studies were performed to investigate the relationship between the SxOA and all-cause mortality, while other five 
studies between the ROA and all-cause mortality. All of the included studies had defined the inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria. Only two included studies included both SxOA and ROA patients. There were 3 studies performed 
in the USA and 1 each in China, Netherlands, England, Italy, Japan and Finland. Two studies recruited patients 
with knee OA, 2 with hand OA, 1 each with hip OA and hip/knee OA and others with hand, knee, hip, or spine 
OA. Only one study recruited female patients, while others included both male and female. Only one study con-
ducted two trials in male and female patients respectively.
Quality assessment and publication bias. 
Using the Newcastle-Ottawa form, all but three studies were 
identified as high quality. The results of quality assessment were presented in Table 2. The publication bias was 
estimated for overall populations by HR of all-cause mortality. No significant publication bias was demonstrated 
for overall populations by Begg rank correlation method (P = 
 0.65).
Meta-analysis. 
In seven studies providing all-cause mortality in RxOA patients, the pooled HR was 0.91 
(95% CI: 0.68–1.23). There was no significant difference in HR of all-cause mortality between the SxOA and 
control groups (Fig. 2). Six trials reported the all-cause mortality in ROA patients. There was no statistically sig-
nificant difference between the ROA patients and control groups (HR = 
 1.13, 95% CI: 0.95–1.35) (Fig. 3).
GRADE Evidence synthesis and recommendation strengths. 
The above two important outcomes 
in the present meta-analysis were evaluated using the GRADE system. The level of evidence quality for each out-
come was very low (Table 3). Therefore, the level of overall evidence quality was very low eventually. This finding 
may lower the confidence in any recommendations.
Discussion
All-cause mortality is a major area of research in OA. However, there has been no consensus regarding whether 
OA is an independent risk factor for mortality. Furthermore, there have been no recommendations for all-cause 
mortality in OA patients based on the current evidence. There is a need for an evidence base to help patients or 
clinician understand the relationship between OA and all-cause mortality and make their clinical decisions. To 
the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first meta-analysis that uses the GRADE system to evaluate the 
quality of the evidence investigating the association between OA and risk of all-cause mortality.

To date, nine articles including 10 prospective studies have examined the association between OA and risk of 
all-cause mortality. Five of them only reported the association between SxOA and mortality, while three between 
ROA and mortality. Two studies reported the relationship between SxOA/ROA and mortality. In the present 
study, we conducted meta-analysis according to SxOA and ROA patients respectively. Random effects model 
was used to conduct statistical analysis because of significant heterogeneity among studies. Thus, more weight 
was placed on the studies with more sample size. Random effect analysis can lower the risk of bias and get the 
pooled data conservatively. Although the results showed that SxOA and ROA were not significantly associated 
with increased risk of mortality, the overall evidence quality was very low. The GRADE evidence quality of pooled 
results will lower our confidence in clinical decision. The studies were carried out in various durations of follow 
up, different geographical locations, and with different OA inclusion criteria. The pooled estimate of primary 
outcomes was consistent across sensitivity analyses and without significant publication bias.
Four included studies6,7,16,19 reported the association between SxOA or ROA in the lower limbs and mortality. 
Because of limited number of included studies involved lower limbs, we cannot conduct subgroup meta-analysis. 
Although pooled results were not performed in lower limbs, the individual study reported the significant associ-
ation between the OA in lower limbs and increased risk of mortality, especially in knee SxOA. Lower limbs OA 
will lower the levels of physical activity, which will influence the survival rate. Therefore, participating in recom-
mended levels of physical activity is associated with reduced risk of mortality22. Because of lower evidence quality, 
we did not have confidence in recommendation currently.
Danielsson et al.23 reported that death rates were higher than expected in persons with ROA of the knees but 
not of the hips. However, Cerhan et al.24 showed that the presence of OA of the hands and bilateral knees was 
associated with reduced survival, while the presence of OA of the hips and feet was not. The reason might be that 
reduced survival is attributed to either lower levels of physical activity or the use of medications in patients with 
OA24. In Haara et al. study20, women with SxOA involving distal interphalangeal joints had an increased mortal-
ity, but neither men nor women with ROA of thumb carpometacarpal joint had an increased risk of mortality. 
Some studies reported that lower levels of physical activity due to disability among the patients with lower limb 
OA, and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflamatory drugs (NSAIDs) explained the increased risk of mortality from 
heart disease6,25. Kerr et al.26 found that was using NSAIDs associated with an increased risk of mortality from 
gastrointestinal. In a longitudinal study27, the adjusted hazard ratio of celecoxib, diclofenac, meloxicam, rofecoxib 
and non-selective NSAIDs were 1.39, 1.44, 1.49, 1.58 and 1.76 respectively. Thus, Kerr et al.27 reported that there 
was a significant increased mortality risk for those exposed to either COX-2-selective or non-selective NSAIDs.
Our previous study6 reported that knee SxOA was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality 
among the residents in the rural areas of China. The reason may be that SxOA patients are likely to suffer from 
physical disability. Lack of walking disability is one of the risk factors for death from cardiovascular diseases. 
Furthermore, SxOA patients are commonly take NSAIDs to relieve their joint symptoms, which will increase the 
risk of morality.
Some degree of clinical heterogeneity was induced by the different anatomical location, medical 
co-morbidities, ethnicity, genetic background, nutritional status of patients, follow-up duration, and diagnosis 
criteria for OA. Heterogeneity, to some extent, may have also been caused by study design. One of the major het-
erogeneity was the several anatomical location of OA during patient recruitment. We cannot perform subgroup 
analysis according to anatomical location due to two studies in knee, one in hip and others in knee, hip, hand or 
spine. Because of limited information got from original studies, heterogeneity cannot be completely resolved.
Although the above kinds of heterogeneity may palace an influence on the pooled results of meta-analysis, the 
evidence quality was summarized according to the current evidence. Because of clinical heterogeneity and limited

information, we, therefore, drew the conclusion that the GRADE evidence quality was very low. The present 
evidence quality meant that reliable and confident evidence did not exist currently in respect of the association 
between OA and all-cause mortality. Moreover, the very low GRADE evidence quality need further high-quality 
studies to be complemented.
The methodological quality assessment for original studies identified a number of limitations to the cur-
rent evidence base. (1) The diagnosis of osteoarthritis in some studies20,21 was recorded by a general practi-
tioner and was not validated based on published classification criteria. (2) Some individuals with asymptomatic

osteoarthritis would be misclassified into the control group, which will lead to a bias21. (3) The various duration 
of follow-up would place a bias on the current results. (4) Clinical heterogeneity may be caused by the preexisting 
conditions of the patients, various diagnosis for OA, the experience level of the evaluators, severity of OA, medical 
commodities, smoking and the economic level. The above confounding factors might have an impact on the pres-
ent outcomes. (5) Meta-analyses of observational studies are subject to bias and provide inappropriate estimates 
for effects size when compared to interventional studies such as RCT. While the results of this meta-analysis 
should be considered appropriate, these limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings.
In the GRADE system of rating the quality of evidence, each observational study began as low quality evidence 
but was rated up by three categories of items. Firstly, the included studies did not yield large or very large esti-
mates of the magnitude of an exposure effect, we may not be confident about the results. Secondly, there was no 
evidence that the influence of all plausible confounding would reduce a demonstrated effect or suggest a spurious 
effect. Thirdly, an exposure-response gradient was not present, accordingly upgrade the quality of evidence was 
not for this outcome. We consider that the above factors could significantly influence the stability of the outcomes. 
The above factors of GRADE evidence quality did not account for the upgraded evidence quality. Therefore, the 
overall GRADE evidence quality was very low. It indicates that the there is no exact evidence involving the associ-
ation between OA and all-cause mortality. High-quality clinical trials are required to verify the above area of OA. 
To some extent, the present study is meaningful for taking clinical recommendation.
According to the very low GRADE evidence quality, the present meta-analysis of cohort studies showed that 
reliable and confident evidence do not exist currently in respect of the association between OA and all-cause 
mortality. The increasing prevalence of OA worldwide calls for further high-quality studies to investigate the 
effects of OA on mortality.
