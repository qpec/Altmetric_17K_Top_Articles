Abstract
Long-term ozone (O3) exposure estimates from chemical transport models are frequently paired with
exposure-response relationships from epidemiological studies to estimate associated health burdens.
Impact estimates using such methods can include biases from model-derived exposure estimates. We
use data solely from dense ground-based monitoring networks in the United States, Europe, and
China for 2015 to estimate long-term O3 exposure and calculate premature respiratory mortality using
exposure-response relationships derived from two separate analyses of the American Cancer Society
Cancer Prevention Study-II (ACS CPS-II) cohort. Using results from the larger, extended ACS CPS-II
study, 34 000 (95% CI: 24, 44 thousand), 32 000 (95% CI: 22, 41 thousand), and 200 000 (95% CI: 140,
253 thousand) premature respiratory mortalities are attributable to long-term O3 exposure in the
USA, Europe and China, respectively, in 2015. Results are approximately 32%–50% lower when using
an older analysis of the ACS CPS-II cohort. Both sets of results are lower (∼20%–60%) on a region-by-
region basis than analogous prior studies based solely on modeled O3, due in large part to the fact that
the latter tends to be high biased in estimating exposure. This study highlights the utility of dense
observation networks in estimating exposure to long-term O3 exposure and provides an observational
constraint on subsequent health burdens for three regions of the world. In addition, these results
demonstrate how small biases in modeled results of long-term O3 exposure can amplify estimated
health impacts due to nonlinear exposure-response curves.
Introduction
There is strong epidemiological and toxicological
evidence linking exposure to ambient ozone (O3) with
adverse health impacts (US EPA 2013). While histor-
ical research has largely focused on impacts attributa-
ble to short-term O3 exposure, there is a growing body
of literature suggesting a significant association
between
long-term
ambient
O3
exposure
and
increased premature mortality, in particular from
respiratory diseases (Jerrett et al 2009, Lipsett et al
2011, Zanobetti and Schwartz 2011, REVIHAAP 2013,
Turner et al 2016). Consequently, exposure-response
relationships, specifically derived from an analysis of
the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention
Study-II (ACS CPS-II) cohort (Jerrett et al 2009), have
been used to estimate the global health burden from
long-term O3 exposure (e.g. Anenberg et al 2010,
Lelieveld et al 2013, Brauer et al 2015).
Due to spatial and temporal limitations of ground-
based monitors, as well as difficulty in relating the ver-
tical column density of O3 observed by satellites to sur-
face values (Duncan et al 2014), global estimates of
long-term O3 exposure are generally estimated using
output from state-of-the-art chemical transport mod-
els (CTMs); (e.g. Anenberg et al 2010, Silva et al 2013,
Brauer et al 2015, Lelieveld et al 2015, Malley
et al 2017, Shindell et al 2018). Using results from a
CTM, the global burden of disease (GBD) project esti-
mated that approximately 254 000 global premature

 mortalities from chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease (COPD) were attributable to long-term ambient
O3 exposure in 2015 (Cohen et al 2017). Results from
other impact studies can vary substantially due to dif-
ferent CTMs being employed to estimate exposure,
updates to exposure-response curves, changing theor-
etical minimum risk exposure levels, varying baseline
mortality rates, and different reference years, making
inter-study comparisons of long-term O3 exposure
health burdens challenging. In addition, there is evi-
dence suggesting that long-term O3 exposure is not
only associated with COPD, but a more comprehen-
sive set of respiratory diseases (Jerrett et al 2009, US
EPA 2013, Turner et al 2016). Some studies even
report significant associations with increased pre-
mature cardiovascular mortality (Lipsett et al 2011,
Jerrett et al 2013, Crouse et al 2015, Cakmak et al 2016,
Turner et al 2016, Day et al 2017). When incorporating
these epidemiological updates, the estimated health
burden attributable to long-term O3 exposure increa-
ses (Malley et al 2017, Shindell et al 2018), indicating
that efforts to reduce long-term O3 exposure could be
more effective in reducing total air pollution-attribu-
table premature mortalities than previously identified
(Schwartz 2016).
Many regions of the world, such as the United
States, Europe, and China, now have dense ground-
based monitoring networks to assess compliance with
air quality standards. Application of these networks to
estimate long-term O3 exposure for health impact
assessments, rather than CTMs, has a number of
advantages. First, this would provide a consistent fra-
mework in relation to many of the underlying epide-
miological studies, which often incorporate these
networks to estimate exposure of the study population
(e.g. Jerrett et al 2009, Turner et al 2016). Second, the
use of compliance monitoring networks to assess
health burdens adds consistency between health bur-
den quantification and regulatory air quality standard
monitoring. Third, while the CTMs used to model
ozone are extensively evaluated and capable of repro-
ducing significant features of atmospheric chemistry,
many of the health-based O3 exposure metrics are
high biased in model predictions (Schnell et al 2015,
Seltzer et al 2017). Lastly, seasonal and spatial trends of
observationally derived exposure metrics can be used
in model evaluations to help diagnose drivers of bias
or provide a reference for bias correction.
In this study, we estimate long-term O3 exposure
in the United States, Europe, and China for 2015
through the exclusive use of ground-based observa-
tion measurements. We then combine these results
with exposure-response relationships to estimate pre-
mature mortalities attributable to long-term O3 expo-
sure in each region. We compare health impact
estimates using multiple exposure-response curves
and averaging metrics, as well as estimates from pre-
viously reported O3 health burdens, discuss the impli-
cations of different averaging metrics, and provide
seasonal population-weighted exposure concentra-
tions that can be used for model evaluations.
Methods
To estimate premature mortalities attributable to
long-term O3 exposure, the exposure-response rela-
tionships and averaging metrics reported by Jerrett
et al (2009) and Turner et al (2016) were utilized.
Jerrett et al (2009) used data from the ACS CPS-II
cohort and air pollution data to estimate changes in
various cause-specific deaths attributable to incre-
mental changes in the April–September average of the
daily 1 h maximum O3 concentration (6mMDA1).
Their cohort spanned 18 years of follow-up and
included 448 850 subjects with 118 777 deaths. Turner
et al (2016) estimated changes in cause-specific deaths
attributable to incremental changes in the annual
average of the maximum daily 8 h average O3 concen-
tration (MDA8) using updated values from the ACS
CPS-II cohort. The Turner et al (2016) cohort spanned
22 years of follow-up and included 669 046 subjects
with 237 201 deaths. It is noted that the use of these
results globally assumes homogeneity in the long-term
O3 exposure-response relationship for cause-specific
mortality. While there is evidence from other cohort
studies in North America showing a significant
relationship between long-term O3 exposure and
premature mortality (Crouse et al 2015, Di et al 2017),
none of the cohort studies conducted in Europe (no
studies are available for Asia) have reported a signifi-
cant relationship with respiratory mortality (Carey
et al 2013, Bentayeb et al 2015). This may be due to
differences in study design, such as exposure estima-
tion methods, length of follow-up, and number of
events (Jerrett et al 2013). Additional cohort studies
are required to evaluate the validity of globally extra-
polating these exposure-response relationships.
Ground based measurements in the United States
were retrieved from the air quality system (AQS) and
the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CAST-
NET), in Europe from the European Union air quality
e-reporting data repository, and in China from the
Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center
and the China National Environmental Monitoring
Center. This compilation has a significant overlap with
the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report dataset
(Schultz et al 2017) in the USA and Europe, but vastly
expands the extent of observations in China. All results
referring to Europe include the 28 European Union
Member States, plus Norway and Switzerland. Grid-
ded surface maps were generated using an objective-
mapping algorithm that combines a modified form of
inverse distance weighting with a declustering scheme
and trapezoidal integration (Schnell et al 2014). This
algorithm has previously been used to evaluate O3 pre-
dictions by a suite of CTMs over North America and
Europe (Schnell et al 2015).

 Daily gridded maps of maximum 1 and 8 h con-
centrations were generated and appropriately aver-
aged to calculate each metric (e.g. annual average for
the Turner et al 2016 metric). Details regarding the
calculation of the population-weighted exposure con-
centrations, as well as the implementation and evalua-
tion of the exposure algorithm, can be found in the
supporting information (available online at stacks.iop.
org/ERL/13/104018/mmedia). Both long-term O3
exposure metrics were calculated at 0.25°×0.25°,
0.5°×0.5°, and 1°×1° grid resolutions. Since chan-
ges in the mean bias and average root mean square
error of the predicted site values were generally insen-
sitive to grid resolution (see tables S1 and S2), all
results presented here utilize 0.5°×0.5° resolution.
Premature mortality attributable to long-term O3
exposure was calculated using previously established
methods (Anenberg et al 2010, Silva et al 2016, Malley
et al 2017) and is summarized below.

cause-specific baseline mortality rate, Population is
the population count in a particular grid box, and
ΔMort is the estimated number of premature, cause-

population and baseline mortality rates can be found

Changes in cause-specific risk varied based on the
underlying epidemiological study. For respiratory dis-
eases, a hazard ratio of 1.040 (95% CI: 1.013, 1.067)
and 1.12 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.16) was used, corresponding
to the Jerrett et al (2009) and Turner et al (2016)
results, respectively. In addition, while there is more
limited evidence for effects of long-term O3 exposure
on cardiovascular mortality, the hazard ratio of 1.03
(95% CI: 1.01, 1.05) from the Turner et al (2016) study
was applied. The TMREL’s used were 33.3 ppb when
using the Jerrett et al (2009) averaging metric and
26.7 ppb when using the Turner et al (2016) averaging
metric. These values correspond to the minimum O3
exposure reported in each of the respective epidemio-
logical studies. Since many studies generate results
without the use of a TMREL (e.g. Anenberg et al 2010,
Fang et al 2013, Silva et al 2013), a sensitivity analysis
was carried out to estimate the mortality burdens
without the use of a threshold. This test assumes that
the standard TMREL values are limited by low con-
centration observations rather than true thresholds
below which no impacts occur and is illustratively
included to provide an upper bound on health
impacts.
Results
Observationally derived estimates of the Jerrett et al
(2009) averaging metric featured distinct patterns in
each of the three regions considered here (figure 1). In
the USA, there is a peak exceeding 60 ppb over inland
southern California. Due to seasonally operating
monitors, some parts of the upper northwest did not
pass the internal quality assurance test and provide
results. Nonetheless, 99% of the population was
captured in grid boxes that did generate results, with a
population-weighted O3 concentration of 49.0 ppb
(table 1).

 Europe
featured
a
decreasing
gradient
in
6mMDA1 concentrations from south to north, with a
peak of approximately 60 ppb in the Po valley region of
Italy, consistent with previous analyses (EEA 2017).
Ireland and Italy had the lowest and highest popula-
tion-weighted 6mMDA1 O3 concentrations, respec-
tively (21.3 ppb and 56.7 ppb; see table S3). Overall,
the population-weighted 6mMDA1 O3 concentration
in Europe was 46.7 ppb (table 1). Across China, there
was an increasing gradient in 6mMDA1 concentra-
tions from south to north, peaking near 90 ppb in the
North China Plain. Large areas of western China were
without monitoring data and exposure estimates were
not generated. However, more than 99% of the popu-
lation resides in the grid cells for which results were
generated and the population-weighted 6mMDA1 O3
concentration was 67.9 ppb (table 1).
Observationally derived estimates of the Turner
et al (2016) averaging metric featured qualitatively
similar spatial patterns (figure 2) when compared to
the 6mMDA1 concentrations, but were quantitatively
smoother. Over the USA, the difference between the
5th and 95th concentration percentiles was 16.2 ppb
and 11.2 ppb for the 6mMDA1 and MDA8 concentra-
tions, respectively. The MDA8 concentrations were
not calculated for a larger number of grid cells due to
some monitors going off-line during winter months.
Nonetheless, with 96% of the USA population still
captured by the reporting grid cells, the population-
weighted MDA8 concentration was 38.1 ppb. Sub-
stantial seasonal variations occur throughout the year,
influencing the spatial distribution of the annual
MDA8 metric (see figures S1–S6). Peak population-
weighted seasonal MDA8 concentrations occurred
during the summer, with a drop of 14 ppb during the
winter (table 1).
In Europe, the difference between the 5th and 95th
concentration percentiles for the 6mMDA1 and
MDA8 concentrations was 21.9 ppb and 13.2 ppb,
respectively. A peak of seasonal MDA8 concentrations
did occur over the Po valley during the summer
(figures S4) but was the location of low concentrations
during the winter (figure S6). Ireland featured the low-
est population-weighted MDA8 concentration of
19.3 ppb, but it was anomalous when compared to the
rest of the continent. While Italy still featured some
of the highest population-weighted concentrations
(38.8 ppb), exposure was comparable in many other
European nations (table S3).
In China, the differences between the 5th and 95th
concentration percentiles were 43.7 ppb and 34.5 ppb
for the 6mMDA1 and MDA8 concentrations, respec-
tively. With 99% of the population captured in grid cells
for which exposure estimates were generated, the popu-
lation-weighted MDA8 concentration was 45.3 ppb.
Large seasonal variations, driven mainly by low winter
concentrations in the North China Plain, led to a
31.4 ppb difference in the population-weighted seasonal

 MDA8 concentrations between the summer and winter
months.
The estimated average number of premature
respiratory mortalities attributable to long-term O3
exposure for 2015 using the Turner et al (2016) expo-
sure-response relationship was 34 000 (95% CI: 24, 44
thousand), 32 000 (95% CI: 22, 41 thousand), and
200 000 (95% CI: 140, 253 thousand) for the USA,
Europe, and China, respectively. When using the
Jerrett et al (2009) exposure-response relationship, the
premature respiratory mortality impacts were lower:
17 000 (95% CI: 6, 27 thousand), 20 000 (95% CI: 7, 33
thousand), and 135 000 (95% CI: 46, 210 thousand) in
the USA, Europe, and China, respectively (table 2
and table S4 for European country-level estimates).
While population-weighted O3 concentrations of both
averaging metrics are higher in the USA than Europe,
estimates of premature respiratory mortalities attribu-
table to long-term O3 exposure are similar in the two
regions. This is largely due to differences in population
density and age-related demographics, with some con-
tributions from differences in baseline mortality rates
(figure S7). In addition, while exposure concentrations
are consistently higher for the 6mMDA1 metric than
the MDA8 metric, health impacts are consistently
higher when using the Turner et al (2016) exposure-
response relationship due to its larger hazard ratio and
lower TMREL.
Normalized results, with impacts reported as pre-
mature mortalities attributable to long-term O3 expo-
sure per 100 000 people, show health burdens higher
in the USA than Europe (table 3). This reflects the
influence of higher population-weighted O3 con-
centrations found in the USA. Respiratory mortality
rates attributable to long-term O3 exposure are quite
variable between European countries (table S5),
reflecting heterogeneity in population-weighted expo-
sure concentrations (table S3), age demographics, and
baseline mortality rates. For all countries considered
in this analysis, baseline respiratory mortality rates are
highest among the oldest age bin of the population (i.e.
80+). As a result, age demographics strongly influence
the health impacts calculated here (table S6), with
more than 75% of the respiratory premature mor-
talities attributable to long-term O3 exposure con-
sistently occurring among the population aged 70 and
above.
When a TMREL is not used, average estimates
increase in all three regions (table 2). In addition, the
estimated average number of premature cardiovas-
cular mortalities attributable to long-term O3 expo-
sure was 17 000 (95% CI: 9, 26 thousand), 24 000 (95%
CI: 12, 36 thousand), and 129 000 (95% CI: 65, 190
thousand) for the USA, Europe, and China, respec-
tively, in 2015. While the hazard ratio of long-term O3
exposure is larger for respiratory disease than cardio-
vascular disease (averages of 1.12 versus 1.03), the lar-
ger mortality rate of cardiovascular disease drove the
substantial estimated impacts.
To compare directly with the GBD project, COPD
related premature mortalities attributable to long-
term O3 exposure were also estimated. Consistent
with the Jerrett et al (2009) study, these calculations
utilized the maximum daily 1 h average O3 concentra-
tion spanning June–August and a hazard ratio of 1.029
(95% CI: 1.010, 1.048). Health burdens for the USA,
Europe, and China in 2015 were 7000 (95% CI: 3, 12
thousand), 11 000 (95% CI: 4, 17 thousand), and
88 000 (95% CI: 32, 139 thousand), respectively. In
comparison, the GBD project estimated that there
were 11 600, 13 330, and 71 850 premature COPD
related mortalities in the three regions attributable to
long-term O3 exposure in 2015 (HEI: Health Effects
Institute 2017). The high biases in the USA and Europe
and low bias in China suggests that the exposure esti-
mates did not adequately capture the ∼40% increase
in population-weighted concentrations over China

This leads to per capita impacts in China that are
∼45% larger than those in the USA in GBD, whereas
we find per capita impacts in China approximately
three times greater. When using the Turner et al (2016)
averaging metric and hazard ratio of 1.14 (95% CI:
1.08, 1.21), COPD related premature mortalities were
22 000 (95% CI: 14, 31 thousand), 21 000 (95% CI: 13,

Discussion
Consistent with two recent studies utilizing CTM
derived
exposure
(Malley
et
al
2017,
Shindell
et al 2018), the observationally derived results pre-
sented here show that respiratory health impacts
attributable to long-term O3 exposure are higher when
using the Turner et al (2016) averaging metric and
exposure-response relationship than the Jerrett et al
(2009) methodology. These findings have important
implications for policy makers and the public for a
number of reasons. First, health impacts attributable
to long-term O3 exposure are indeed likely higher
when using the newest ACS CPS-II cohort analysis and
expanded further if the association between long-term
O3 exposure and cardiovascular mortality is shown to
be causal and included in the total health burden
estimates. Second, the Turner et al (2016) averaging
metric considers annual O3 exposure, rather than 6
months. This is particularly relevant for the three
regions included in this analysis, where the seasonal
cycle and regional distributions of O3 have shifted over
the last few decades (Parrish et al 2012, Clifton
et al 2014, Simon et al 2015, Lefohn et al 2017, Seltzer
et al 2017). Finally, this also highlights the importance
of chemistry transport models accurately capturing O3
seasonal cycles in generating exposure estimates for
health impact assessments. Overall, the results pre-
sented here are generally lower than what has been
reported in recent model-based studies (table 4).
However, as previously noted, each study may use
different TMRELs, baseline mortality rates, and refer-
ence years. Only one study, Shindell et al (2018), which
utilized a bias-adjustment, generated results compar-
able to what is reported here.
An additional reason for the differences between
the results presented here and those in prior studies
relates to biased exposure estimates and the interac-
tion between these exposure estimates and nonlinear
exposure-response curves. For this study, a log-linear
exposure-response function (figure S8) was selected
since it is most commonly applied in health impact
assessments (e.g. Anenberg et al 2010, Silva et al 2013,
Silva et al 2016, Malley et al 2017, Shindell et al 2018).
However, other forms of exposure-response functions
can be used. For example, Di et al (2017) reported a
linear connection between long-term O3 exposure and
mortality and the World Health Organization suggests
linear exposure-response relationships for short-term
O3 exposure studies (REVIHAAP 2013). The shape of
exposure-response curves have been previously dis-
cussed in health impact studies focused on exposure to
ambient fine particulate matter (Pope et al 2009, Smith
and Peel 2010, Apte et al 2015). While prior studies
have indeed noted that high biased O3 predictions are
consistent in models that are typically used to estimate
long-term O3 exposure (e.g. Schnell et al 2015, Yan
et al 2016, Travis et al 2016, Seltzer et al 2017), an effort
to translate how this bias might influence health
impacts has yet to be undertaken.
To test this interaction, the observationally derived
exposure metrics were artificially scaled and the result-
ing health impacts were subsequently calculated. The
new health impact estimates were then compared to
the reference impact estimates (figure 3). Since the
impact estimates are normalized to a reference case,

 variations are exclusively due to changes in exposure
(i.e. differences in population demographics do not
influence these normalized results). When using the
Jerrett et al (2009) averaging metric and exposure-
response relationship, a 10% increase in exposure (i.e.
a 10% high bias in the population-weighted exposure
concentration) yields a 29%, 35%, and 18% increase in
the estimated health impacts in the USA, Europe, and
China, respectively. When using the Turner et al
(2016) methodology, a 10% increase in exposure
yields a 29%, 44%, and 21% increase in the estimated
health impacts in the USA, Europe, and China,
respectively.
In the prior example, normalized impacts for Eur-
ope were consistently most sensitive to changes in the
exposure metrics, followed by the USA and then
China. Population-weighted concentrations of each
metric follow the same order (table 1). This relation-
ship illustrates how a larger normalized change in
health impacts occurs at the lower exposure end of
each curve. For example, when using the Turner et al
(2016) averaging metric, the USA and China feature
average exposures of 38.1 ppb and 45.3 ppb, respec-
tively (table 1). The exposure-response curve using the
Turner et al (2016) hazard ratio (figure S8) is steeper at
38.1 ppb than 45.3 ppb, which leads to the stronger
marginal response in impacts (figure 3). This relation-
ship is important from a health impacts perspective
and should also be noted when considering how bias
in exposure estimates influence health calculations in
various regions.
Some uncertainties in the results presented here
include a small bias in the gridding method (see figures
S9 and S10). Though, the mean bias of estimated con-
centrations at each monitor from the complete popu-
lation of observations is nearly zero for the three
regions. Second, inherent in the mapping algorithm is
the assumption that non-observed locations can be
estimated using nearby observations. The exposure
results show that the final gridded surface maps
(figures 1 and 2) have coherent spatial gradients, pro-
viding confidence in these assumptions. Third, it is
assumed that the gridded surface maps generated here
are of sufficient resolution to capture exposure esti-
mates. While all results presented here are at
0.5°×0.5° resolution, additional gridded surface
maps of both metrics were calculated at horizontal
resolutions of 0.25°×0.25° and 1.0°×1.0°. Health
impact estimates at each of these resolutions show lit-
tle difference (tables S1 and S2). Fourth, the Jerrett et al
(2009) averaging metric used here was calculated using
the April–September average of the 1 h daily max-
imum O3 concentration rather than a grid-by-grid
calculation to account for changes in regional O3 sea-
sons. This was performed to provide consistent popu-
lation-weighted exposure concentrations that can
subsequently be used for model and exposure evalua-
tions. To test the influence of this assumption, popula-
tion-weighted concentrations for all possible 6 month
averaging periods in 2015 were calculated. The April–
September average yielded the highest exposure esti-
mates for the USA, China, and a majority of the Eur-
opean countries.
Conclusions
Gridded surface maps of long-term O3 exposure for
2015 in the USA, Europe, and China were estimated
through the exclusive use of ground-based monitoring
networks
and
an
objective-mapping
algorithm
(Schnell et al 2014). This estimation of exposure differs
from the widely used method of chemical transport
modeling, which can incorporate model biases. Seaso-
nal population-weighted concentrations of two expo-
sure metrics were presented and can be used by the
modeling community for model evaluation, to eluci-
date drivers of model bias, and possibly as correction
factors to reduce persistent bias. Using the Jerrett et al

 function, 17 000 (95% CI: 6, 27 thousand), 20 000
(95% CI: 7, 33 thousand), and 135 000 (95% CI: 46,
210 thousand) premature respiratory mortalities attri-
butable to long-term O3 exposure in 2015 were
estimated for the USA, Europe, and China, respec-
tively. When using the Turner et al (2016) methodol-
ogy, based on a larger, extended cohort analysis, the
estimated health burdens increase to 34 000 (95% CI:
24, 44 thousand), 32 000 (95% CI: 22, 41 thousand),
and 200 000 (95% CI: 140, 253 thousand) for the USA,
Europe, and China, respectively. After accounting for
differences in exposure-response functions, these
estimated impacts are lower (∼20%–60%) than what
has previously been reported. This is due to small
biases in modeled exposure being amplified by non-
linear exposure-response curves, thus highlighting the
importance of accurately estimating long-term O3
exposure in health impact assessments. Overall, the
results presented here provide an observational con-
straint of long-term O3 exposure impacts on health
burdens for three major regions of the world.
