BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In 2015, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices 
recommended that 16- to 23-year-olds may be vaccinated with the serogroup B 
meningococcal (MenB) vaccine on the basis of individual clinical decision-making (Category 
B). We assessed the following among US pediatricians and family physicians (FPs): (1) 
practices regarding MenB vaccine delivery, (2) factors influencing a decision to recommend 
the MenB vaccine, and (3) factors associated with discussing the MenB vaccine.
METHODS: We surveyed a nationally representative sample of pediatricians and FPs via e-mail 
and Internet from October 2016 to December 2016.
RESULTS: The response rate was 72% (660 of 916). During routine visits, 51% of pediatricians 
and 31% of FPs reported always or often discussing MenB vaccine. Among those who 
discussed often or always, 91% recommended vaccination; among those who never or 
rarely discussed, 11% recommended. We found that 73% of pediatricians and 41% of FPs 
currently administered the MenB vaccine. Although many providers reported not knowing 
about factors influencing recommendation decisions, MenB disease outbreaks (89%), 
disease incidence (62%), and effectiveness (52%), safety (48%), and duration of protection 
of MenB vaccine (39%) increased the likelihood of recommendation, whereas the Category 
B recommendation (45%) decreased likelihood. Those somewhat or not at all aware of the 
MenB vaccine (risk ratio 0.32 [95% confidence interval 0.25–0.41]) and those practicing in 
a health maintenance organization (0.39 [0.18–0.87]) were less likely, whereas those aware 
of disease outbreaks in their state (1.25 [1.08–1.45]) were more likely to discuss MenB 
vaccine.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary care physicians have significant gaps in knowledge about MenB disease 
and the MenB vaccine, and this appears to be a major driver of the decision not to discuss 
the vaccines.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: In 2015, the Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices recommended 16- to 
23-year-olds may be vaccinated with serogroup B meningococcal 
(MenB) vaccine on the basis of individual clinical decision-making 
(Category B). Little is known about how primary care physicians 
are adopting these recommendations.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: A minority of physicians are discussing 
MenB vaccine during routine 16- to 18-year-old visits. Significant 
gaps in knowledge about MenB disease and the MenB vaccine exist 
and appear to be a major driver of decisions not to discuss the 
vaccine.

 Meningococcal disease has an overall 
case-fatality ratio of ∼10% to 15%, 
and permanent severe sequelae  
are common among survivors, 
1 
– 
3  
heightening the importance of 
preventing this deadly infection. 
At the same time, meningococcal 
disease caused by any serogroup is 
uncommon in the United States and 
has been decreasing4 since the mid-
1990s because of a variety of reasons, 
including natural decline and, among 
adolescents and young adults, the 
use of a quadrivalent meningococcal 
conjugate vaccine against serogroups 
A, C, W, and Y meningococcal 
(MenACWY). The MenACWY vaccine 
has been licensed in the United States 
since 2005 and is recommended for 
routine use among adolescents from 
11 to 18 years of age.
Meningococcal disease caused by 
serogroup B is also uncommon, 
with 130 cases in 2016, 41 of which 
were diagnosed in those aged 16 
to 23 years.5 However, numerous 
highly publicized outbreaks have 
occurred on college campuses 
since 2009. Two serogroup B 
meningococcal (MenB) vaccines have 
been licensed by the Food and Drug 
Administration in the United States 
and approved for use in persons 
aged 10 to 25 years: MenB-FHbp 
(Trumenba) and MenB-4C (Bexsero). 
Both vaccines were licensed 
under an accelerated approval 
process because of the outbreaks 
occurring on college campuses. 
Food and Drug Administration 
approval was based on safety 
and on demonstration of inferred 
efficacy by antibody responses to 
selected MenB strains rather than 
clinical effectiveness.4 In October 
of 2015, the Advisory Committee 
on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
recommended that 16- to 23-year-
olds may be vaccinated with the 
MenB vaccine, with a preferred age 
for administration of 16 to 18 years 
(Category B recommendation).4 
In contrast, a Category A (routine) 
recommendation had already been 
made in June of 2015 for persons 
aged ≥10 years at increased risk for 
MenB disease.6
The definitions of Category A and 
B recommendations were based on 
the Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development and 
Evaluation framework, 
7 which had 
been used to guide decision-making 
by ACIP since 2012. Category A 
recommendations are made for all 
persons in an age or risk factor–
based group, whereas for Category 
B recommendations, the decision 
whether to vaccinate was to occur 
“in the context of a clinician-patient 
interaction, 
” with consideration of 
the balance between desirable and 
undesirable effects of the vaccine in 
question.7 The language for ACIP’s 
Category B recommendation for 
MenB vaccines incorporated the 
wording “may be administered, 
” and 
the accompanying rationale identified 
the low prevalence of the disease, 
as well as insufficient data about 
vaccine effectiveness and safety, as 
reasons for not making a Category 
A recommendation. The Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) did not provide additional 
guidance on how to implement the 
ACIP recommendation. The American 
Academy of Family Physicians 
(AAFP) in February 2016 included 
frequently asked questions about 
the MenB vaccine on its Web site, 
providing some guidance to its 
members, but no specific talking 
points.8 The American Academy 
of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee 
on Infectious Diseases published 
similar recommendations to ACIP’s 
almost 1 year later in September 
2016, 1 month before our survey. 
The AAP encourages pediatricians 
to discuss the benefits, risks, and 
costs with patients and families and 
then “work with them to determine 
what is in their best interest.” 
9 No 
national data are available about how 
state or local public health agencies 
advised implementing the MenB 
vaccine recommendations for healthy 
adolescents and young adults.
Given the relatively new ACIP 
recommendations for the use of 
the MenB vaccine and the fact that 
this is the first widespread use of a 
Category B recommendation, it was 
unclear how the MenB vaccine would 
be adopted. The objectives of this 
study were to assess the following: 
(1) current practices regarding MenB 
vaccine delivery in primary care, (2) 
reported influences on the decision 
to recommend or not recommend the 
MenB vaccine to healthy adolescent 
patients, and (3) factors related 
to initiating a discussion about 
the MenB vaccine at well visits for 
adolescents 16 to 18 years of age.
METHODS
We conducted a survey between 
October and December of 2016 
among pediatricians and family 
physicians (FPs) who were part 
of sentinel networks within each 
specialty. The human subjects review 
board at the University of Colorado 
Denver approved this study.
Study Population
This survey was conducted as part 
of a collaboration with the CDC to 
perform rapid turnaround surveys 
to assess physician attitudes about 
vaccine-related issues. We developed 
national networks of primary care 
physicians by recruiting from the 
AAP and AAFP. We conducted quota 
sampling10 to ensure network 
physicians were similar to the AAP 
and AAFP memberships with respect 
to region, practice location, and 
practice setting. Exclusion criteria 
included practicing <50% of the time 
in primary care, not practicing in the 
United States, or being in training. 
We have previously demonstrated 
that survey responses from network 
physicians compared with those 
of physicians randomly sampled 
from American Medical Association 
databases had similar demographic

Downloaded from 
 characteristics, practice attributes, 
and attitudes about a range of 
vaccination issues.10 No incentives 
were provided to the participating 
physicians.
Survey Design
We developed the survey in 
collaboration with the CDC and 
with input from the AAP and 
AAFP. A national advisory panel of 
pediatricians and FPs pretested the 
survey; it was then piloted among 45 
pediatricians and 13 FPs nationally 
and further modified on the basis 
of this feedback. The survey began 
by specifying the 2 MenB vaccines 
with trade names, clarifying that 
the MenB vaccine currently has a 
Category B recommendation from the 
ACIP for use in healthy adolescents 
and young adults, and then specified 
that the survey was about the MenB 
vaccine, not the MenACWY vaccine. 
We used 4-point Likert scales for 
assessing reported frequency of 
initiating discussions regarding the 
MenB vaccine and recommendation 
practices at different ages. 
Although the MenB vaccine is not 
recommended for 11- to 12-year-
olds, we included this age group to 
assess whether there was confusion 
about whether the MenB vaccine 
should be given at the same time 
as the first MenACWY vaccine. We 
also asked about how each of a list 
of factors affected the likelihood of 
recommending the MenB vaccine by 
using a 5-point scale.
Survey Administration
We surveyed physicians via Internet 
(Verint, Melville, NY) or, if they 
preferred, by mail. We sent the 
Internet group an initial e-mail with 
up to 8 reminders, and we sent the 
mail group an initial mailing and up 
to 2 reminders. We sent Internet 
survey nonrespondents a mail survey 
in case of problems with e-mail 
correspondence. We patterned the 
mail protocol on Dillman’s tailored 
design method.11
Statistical Analysis
We pooled Internet and mail surveys 
for analyses because studies have 
revealed that physician attitudes 
are similar when obtained by 
either method.12 
– 
14 We compared 
respondents with nonrespondents 
using t tests and χ2 analyses and 
compared pediatrician and FP 
responses by using χ2 and Mantel-
Haenszel χ2 tests. We conducted 
a multivariable analysis with the 
dependent variable of “always, 
almost always, or often” initiating 
a discussion about the MenB 
vaccine during routine well visits 
for adolescents from 16 to 18 
years of age. Because the outcome 
was common (42% of the cohort), 
we used a log binomial model to 
generate relative risks. Independent 
variables included provider and 
practice characteristics, whether 
the MenB vaccine is administered 
at the office, the level of awareness 
regarding the MenB vaccine, and 
the awareness of outbreaks of 
meningococcal disease or MenB 
disease specifically. We used a 
cutoff of P < .25 for inclusion of 
variables into the model. With our 
multivariable model, we used a 
backward elimination procedure in 
which the least significant predictor 
in the model was eliminated 
sequentially. At each step, estimates 
were checked to make sure other 
variables were not affected by 
dropping the least significant 
variable. This resulted in the 
retention of only those factors that 
were significant at P < .05 in the final 
model. Analyses were performed by 
using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS 
Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
The overall response rate was 
72% (660 of 916), 79% (374 of 
475) among pediatricians, and 
65% (286 of 441) among FPs. In 
 
Table 1, we compare respondents 
and nonrespondents within each 
specialty and describe additional 
characteristics available only for 
respondents. Some differences were 
seen between respondents and 
nonrespondents by region among 
pediatricians and by provider sex and 
practice setting among FPs.
Current Practices Regarding MenB 
Vaccine Delivery
As shown in Fig 1, 50% of 
pediatricians and 31% of FPs 
reported always or often initiating 
a discussion about the MenB 
vaccine during routine visits for 
16- to 18-year-olds, and slightly 
more initiated discussions during 
precollege physical examinations. 
Pediatricians were more likely to 
initiate discussions than FPs among 
all age groups examined, with the 
exception of 11- to 12-year-olds. 
Among pediatricians, 34% reported 
strongly recommending the vaccine 
and 24% recommending, but not 
strongly, to 16- to 18-year-olds; 
comparable percentages for FPs 
were 29% and 21%, respectively 
(Fig 2). Strong recommendations 
for those entering college were ∼10 
percentage points higher than for the 
16- to 18-year-old age group for both 
specialties. Overall, slightly higher 
percentages of providers in both 
specialties reported recommending 
the MenB vaccine compared with 
initiating a discussion, although 
initiating was highly correlated 
with recommending. Among those 
who reported initiating a discussion 
always or often during routine 
visits for 16- to 18-year-olds, 91% 
recommended the MenB vaccine 
(66% strongly); among those who 
never or rarely initiated a discussion, 
only 11% recommended the MenB 
vaccine (3% strongly). Not all 
who recommended the vaccine 
reported consistently initiating a 
discussion about it; among those 
who recommended the vaccine, 
71% often, almost always, or always 
initiated a discussion and another 
21% sometimes did. Comparable 
percentages among those who

 made no recommendation were 6% 
and 16%, respectively. Eighty-one 
percent of pediatricians and 56% 
of FPs recommended the vaccine 
to children ≥10 years old with an 
increased risk for meningococcal 
disease.
Seventy-three percent of 
pediatricians and 41% of FPs 
reported currently administering 
the MenB vaccine in their practices; 
2% of pediatricians and 11% of 
FPs did not know if the MenB 
vaccine was being administered. 
Although 6% of pediatricians and 
26% of FPs and those who were 
not solo providers did not know the 
practices of other providers in their 
practice, the majority of physicians 
who reported knowing indicated 
that either a minority or none of 
the other providers were routinely 
recommending the MenB vaccine to 
16- to 23-year-olds (Fig 3).
Reported Influences on the Decision 
to Recommend or Not Recommend 
the MenB Vaccine to Healthy 
Adolescent Patients
As shown in Fig 4, many providers, 
especially FPs, responded “I don’t 
know” to questions about factors 
influencing their likelihood of 
recommending the MenB vaccine. 
The most commonly reported issues 
that were associated with a higher 
likelihood of recommending were 
the fact that MenB outbreaks had 
occurred, the incidence of the MenB 
disease, the effectiveness and safety 
of the MenB vaccine, and the duration 
of protection of the MenB vaccine. 
The existence of a recommendation 
for another meningococcal vaccine 
(MenACWY) and the consistency of 
reimbursement were related to a 
lower likelihood of recommendation.

 The fact that the MenB vaccine was 
given a Category B as opposed to a 
Category A recommendation by the 
ACIP was the major issue identified 
by both specialties associated with 
not recommending the MenB vaccine. 
Additional issues (not shown) 
endorsed by a majority as “not a 
factor” for influencing the decision 
to recommend the MenB vaccine 
included the following: the number of 
vaccines given to adolescents (“not a 
factor” for 76% of pediatricians and 
59% of FPs), parents’ attitudes about 
the MenB vaccine in our practice 
(59% and 52%), the fact that the 
MenB vaccination requires multiple 
doses (79% and 53%), marketing by 
pharmaceutical companies for the 
MenB vaccine (74% and 66%), and 
the time it would take me to discuss 
what a Category B recommendation 
means (69% and 50%).
Factors Related to Initiating a 
Discussion About the MenB Vaccine 
at Well Visits for Adolescents 16 to 
18 Years of Age
As shown in Table 2, being aware of 
MenB disease outbreaks that have 
occurred in the providers’ state was 
associated with always or almost 
always or often initiating a discussion 
of MenB vaccine for adolescents 16 
to 18 years of age, whereas being 
only somewhat or not at all aware of 
the MenB vaccine and practicing in 
a health maintenance organization 
(HMO) compared with a private 
practice setting were associated 
with a lower frequency of initiating a 
discussion. FPs were much less likely 
to have been aware of the MenB 
vaccine before taking the survey, 
and specialty and level of awareness 
were both independently associated 
with the outcome. However, when 
both variables were included 
in the model, specialty became 
nonsignificant, so only awareness of 
the MenB vaccine was retained in the 
model. There was no evidence of a 
significant interaction between these 
2 variables.
DISCUSSION
This is the first national US survey 
of which we are aware in which 
researchers assess reported 
practices related to MenB vaccine 
delivery since the ACIP’s Category B 
recommendation for its use. With our 
findings, we indicate that one-half 
of pediatricians and approximately 
one-third of FPs report often or 
always initiating a discussion 
about the MenB vaccine for 16- to 
18-year-olds. Greater awareness 
about outbreaks of disease was 
associated with a higher likelihood

 of discussing the vaccine, whereas 
lower awareness about the vaccine 
and working in an HMO setting were 
associated with a lower likelihood. 
Those physicians who reported 
initiating a discussion almost always 
reported making a recommendation 
to vaccinate, whereas those who 
rarely initiated discussions were 
unlikely to recommend vaccination. 
Providers most often cited outbreaks 
of MenB disease, incidence of 
disease, and effectiveness, safety, and 
duration of protection of the MenB 
vaccine as reasons for increasing 
their likelihood of recommending 
the MenB vaccine, although many 
providers reported a lack of 
knowledge regarding these potential 
influences. Two factors many 
providers reported would make 
them less likely to recommend the 
MenB vaccine were the fact that the 
MenB vaccine was given a Category B 
recommendation and inconsistency 
of reimbursement.
Whether our data indicate a level 
of discussion regarding the MenB 
vaccine that is consistent with 
a Category B recommendation 
depends on one’s interpretation of 
how such a recommendation should 
be implemented. According to the 
original definition of a Category 
B recommendation based on the 
Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development and 
Evaluation approach used by the 
ACIP, such recommendations are 
supposed to result in individual 
clinical decision-making “in the 
context of a clinician-patient 
interaction.” 
7 In line with this 
interpretation, the authors of 
the AAP’s policy statement, as 
previously discussed, encouraged 
pediatricians to discuss the MenB 
vaccine with parents and patients.9 
Others have stressed that a Category 
B recommendation is different 
from “no recommendation at all” 
and should consistently result in a 
discussion with parents and patients 
because individual decision-making 
“cannot occur if a patient does not 
know about the vaccine and the 
disease.” 
15
However, physicians may interpret 
“individual clinical decision-making” 
to reflect their own decision about 
whether to initiate a discussion 
of the MenB vaccine, given their 
assessment of the risks and benefits 
of vaccinating, without involving 
parents or patients in decision-
making. Providers may choose 
not to initiate a discussion with 
parents or patients if they do not 
intend to recommend the MenB 
vaccine because of issues such as 
the low burden of the MenB disease 
in the United States or the lack 
of data about the effectiveness of 
the MenB vaccine, its duration of 
protection, or its safety.4 In our 
study, the fact that those providers 
who reported initiating a discussion 
were overwhelmingly also likely

 to recommend the MenB vaccine, 
whereas those not initiating 
a discussion were unlikely to 
recommend, is consistent with this 
second interpretation. Providers 
not initiating a discussion may not 
think the time required to discuss 
the MenB vaccine is justified by the 
risks posed by the disease or the 
benefits offered by these vaccines. 
Alternatively, they may have a low 
level of awareness regarding the 
disease or the MenB vaccine and feel 
insufficiently knowledgeable to have 
an informed discussion about the 
pros and cons of vaccination. They

 MenB vaccination. Why providers 
working in an HMO setting were 
less likely to initiate a discussion is 
unclear. This may reflect different 
decisions regarding the cost-benefit 
ratio of the MenB vaccination in an 
HMO as opposed to other practice 
settings or may reflect more 
centralized decision processes in 
HMO settings.
Our data reveal a lack of familiarity 
with many aspects of the MenB 
disease and the MenB vaccine 
among primary care providers. For 
example, the incidence of the MenB 
disease, the vaccines’ effectiveness, 
and the duration of protection 
afforded by the vaccines were 
among the top 5 reasons supporting 
a higher likelihood of provider 
recommendation. In truth, the 
low incidence of the MenB disease 
might be expected to be a likely 
reason for not recommending these 
vaccines. The vaccines’ effectiveness 
against clinical disease had not 
been demonstrated at the time 
but was inferred on the basis of an 
immunologic marker of protection, 
and the 2 licensed vaccines were 
not expected to provide protection 
against all serogroup B strains 
circulating.4 In addition, the 
duration of protection provided 
by the MenB vaccines is unknown, 
and studies have revealed a rather 
steep decline in antibodies for both 
vaccines, suggesting protection may 
in fact be short-lived.16, 
 
17 Finally, 
sizable portions of respondents, 
especially FPs, reported they “didn’t 
know” how these factors influenced 
recommendation decisions. 
Providers were also more likely 
to recommend the MenB vaccine 
at precollege visits rather than 
routine 16- to 18-year-old health 
maintenance visits, as recommended 
by the ACIP, possibly as the result 
of the extensive publicity around 
college outbreaks of the MenB 
disease. They were more likely to 
initiate a discussion regarding the 
vaccine if they were aware of the 
MenB disease outbreaks in their 
state, despite the fact that most 
cases are not outbreak-related.9 
Approximately 10% of pediatricians 
and one-third of FPs reported 
recommending the MenB vaccine 
to healthy 11- to 12-year-olds, 
indicating confusion with timing 
for the first MenACWY vaccine. 
In addition, 19% of pediatricians 
and 43% of FPs reported making 
no recommendation regarding 
the MenB vaccine for children 
aged ≥10 years who were at 
increased risk for meningococcal 
disease. MenB vaccination in this 
group is a Category A, rather than 
Category B recommendation; 
therefore, this is an important 
misunderstanding among primary 
care physicians. These findings 
suggest a need to develop methods 
of better highlighting differential 
recommendations for the same 
vaccine in different patient groups.
The rather substantial differences 
in awareness regarding the MenB 
vaccine and in delivery practices 
seen between pediatricians and FPs 
reflect previous literature. Similar 
to previous studies regarding 
childhood12 
– 
14, 
 
18– 
20 and adolescent 
vaccines, 
21 
– 
26 FPs were much less 
likely to have been aware of the 
MenB vaccine before our survey and 
were less likely to report initiating 
a discussion or recommending the 
MenB vaccine or to administer the 
MenB vaccine in their office. The 
multivariable model suggests that 
the lack of knowledge regarding 
the MenB vaccine was a major 
contributing factor in not initiating 
vaccine discussions. FPs were 
also more likely to report they 
didn’t know about many of the 
factors queried as reasons for 
recommending or not recommending 
the MenB vaccine. As discussed in 
previous literature, FPs may have 
different attitudes and practices than 
pediatricians related to the fact that 
they may see fewer or less severe 
cases of certain childhood diseases, 
have more competing demands given 
their focus on both children and 
adults, and may face more barriers 
related to vaccine financing and 
vaccine supply.19, 
 
27
There are strengths and limitations 
to our data. We surveyed large, 
nationally representative samples 
of pediatricians and FPs and 
achieved high response rates. The 
responses of our sentinel physicians 
may not be fully generalizable, 
especially because participating 
providers are aware they are going 
to be surveyed about vaccine-
related issues. However, authors of 
previous work have demonstrated 
the sampling methods described 
yield similar responses to the most 
commonly employed method of 
sampling physicians nationally.10 
Nonrespondents may have had 
different views than respondents, 
although the high response 
rates somewhat mitigate against 
this source of bias. The survey 
was conducted a year after the 
Category B recommendations 
were made, and results might 
differ if a longer time frame 
after the recommendations had 
been used. Finally, physicians’ 
reported frequency of initiating a 
discussion about the MenB vaccine 
or recommending it were based 
on self-report rather than direct 
observation and responses may 
reflect social desirability bias.
Primary care physicians are 
responding to the new Category 
B recommendation for the MenB 
vaccine in a variety of ways, which 
might be expected from this type of 
recommendation. Our data suggest 
that a lack of knowledge about 
MenB disease or awareness of the 
MenB vaccine may be a primary 
motivation for not initiating a 
discussion for many, rather than 
clinician or parent and patient 
assessment of the risk and benefit 
of these vaccines. Many primary 
care physicians do not appear 
to be familiar enough with the 
KEMPE et al

Downloaded from 
 data required to have a well-
informed discussion with parents 
and patients about the pros and 
cons of the MenB vaccination in 
healthy adolescents. In addition, 
sizable percentages are unaware 
of the routine recommendation 
for MenB vaccination in children 
aged ≥10 years at increased risk. 
Lack of awareness about the MenB 
vaccine may not be surprising 
given the competing demands of 
primary care, the low prevalence 
of MenB disease, and the relative 
newness of the recommendation. 
With our data, we highlight the 
challenges providers face with 
implementing recommendations 
for vaccination based on individual 
clinical decision-making when they 
have limited experience with a 
disease and limited knowledge of 
a new vaccine. Because category 
B recommendations are likely 
to continue to occur in certain 
situations, it will be key for  
national clinical organizations such 
as the AAP and AAFP to provide as 
specific guidance as possible about 
how to implement Category  
B recommendations  
for different vaccines, including 
talking points, to assist in the 
complex decision-making that  
such a recommendation  
requires.
