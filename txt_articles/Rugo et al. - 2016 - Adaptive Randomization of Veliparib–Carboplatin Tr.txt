Abstract
Background—I-SPY 2 is a phase 2 standing multicenter platform trial designed to screen 
multiple experimental regimens in combination with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy for 
breast cancer. The goal is to matching experimental regimens with responding patient subtypes. 
We report results for veliparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, combined with 
carboplatin (VC).
Methods—Eligible women had ≥2.5 cm stage II/III breast cancer, categorized into 8 biomarker 
subtypes based on HER2, hormone-receptor status (HR) and MammaPrint. Patients are adaptively 
randomized within subtype to better performing regimens compared to standard therapy (control). 
Regimens are evaluated within 10 signatures, prospectively defined combinations of subtypes. VC 
plus standard therapy was considered for HER2-negative tumors and therefore evaluated in 3 
signatures. The primary endpoint of I-SPY 2 is pathologic complete response (pCR). MR volume 
changes during treatment inform the likelihood that a patient will achieve pCR. Regimens graduate 
if and when they have a high (Bayesian) predictive probability of success in a subsequent phase 3 
neoadjuvant trial within the graduating signature.
Results—VC graduated in triple-negative breast cancer with 88% predicted probability of phase 
3 success. A total of 72 patients were randomized to VC and 44 to concurrent controls. Respective 
pCR estimates (95% probability intervals) were 51% (35%–69%) vs 26% (11%–40%). Greater 
toxicity of VC was manageable.
Conclusion—The design of I-SPY 2 has the potential to efficiently identify responding tumor 
subtypes for the various therapies being evaluated. VC added to standard therapy improves pCR 
rates specifically in triple-negative breast cancer.
INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is genetically and clinically heterogeneous, making it challenging to identify 
optimal therapies. Although breast cancer mortality in the United States has decreased, over 
40,000 women in the U.S. still die of this disease yearly.1 Further decreases in mortality will 
require therapeutic options that target tumor biology and can be delivered before metastases.
The neoadjuvant approach facilitates evaluating an individual patient’s response to treatment 
and holds promise for developing experimental therapies for disease while it is still curable.2

 Long-term outcomes are equivalent to those when the same chemotherapy is given 
adjuvantly.2 Importantly, eradication of tumor in response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 
designated as pathologic Complete Response (pCR) in breast and axillary nodes at surgery, 
correlates with event-free and overall survival depending on molecular subtype, with 
particularly strong correlation for triple-negative (HER2−/HR−) and HER2+ diseases.3 For 
these reasons there is intense interest in the neoadjuvant approach.4,5
The I-SPY 2 TRIAL (Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response 
Through Imaging and Molecular AnaLysis 2, I-SPY 2) is a multicenter, randomized phase 2 
‘platform’ trial in which experimental arms consisting of novel agents or novel combinations 
added to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy are adaptively randomized in patients with 
high risk primary breast cancer. The primary endpoint is pCR.6
The trial goal from the drug development perspective is to rapidly identify which patient 
subtypes (or ‘signature’), if any, are sufficiently responsive to enable a small, focused and 
successful phase 3 trial. From the perspective of patients in the trial, they are assigned with 
higher probability to regimens that are performing better for patients who share their 
biomarker subtypes and to better identify regimens that are more effective for such patients.
We report results from the first experimental regimen to “graduate,” i.e., leave the trial due 
to a strong efficacy signal: the poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) inhibitor veliparib and 
carboplatin, added to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
METHODS
Study design
I-SPY 2 is an ongoing, multicenter, open-label, adaptive phase 2 master protocol or 
‘platform’ trial with multiple experimental arms that evaluate novel agents combined with 
standard neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancers at high risk of recurrence.6 Experimental 
treatments are compared against a common control arm of standard neoadjuvant therapy, 
with the primary endpoint being pCR, which is defined as no residual cancer in either breast 
or lymph nodes at time of surgery. Patients who dropout after starting therapy (with or 
without withdrawal of consent) or fail to have surgery for any reason are counted as non-
pCRs.
Biomarker assessments (HER2, HR, MammaPrint) performed at baseline are used to 
classify patients into 2×2×2 = 8 prospectively defined subtypes for randomization purposes. 
In addition to standard IHC and FISH assays, the protocol included a microarray-based 
assay of HER2 expression (TargetPrintTM). This assay has previously shown high 
concordance with standard IHC and FISH assays of HER28. The adaptive randomization 
algorithm assigns patients with biomarker subtypes to competing drugs/arms based on 
current Bayesian probabilities of achieving pCR within that subtype vs control with 20% of 
patients assigned to control. Adaptive randomization speeds the identification of treatments 
that perform better within specific patient subtypes and helps avoid exposing patients to 
therapies that are unlikely to benefit them (Figure 1A).9,10

 To assess efficacy, ten clinically relevant biomarker ‘signatures’ were defined in the 
protocol: All; HR+; HR−; HER2+; HER2−; MP Hi-2; HER2+/HR+; HER2+/HR−; 
HER2−/HR+; HER2−/HR−. Experimental arms are continually evaluated against control for 
each of these signatures and “graduate” when and if they demonstrate statistical superiority 
in pCR rate. Statistical analyses are Bayesian.9,11 Graduation requires an 85% Bayesian 
predictive probability of success in a 300-patient equally randomized neoadjuvant phase 3 
trial with a traditional statistical design comparing to the same control arm and primary 
endpoint, pCR, as in I-SPY 2. (see Supplementary Information). Predictive probabilities of 
success are power calculations for a 300-patient trial averaged with respect to the current 
probability distributions of pCR rates for the experimental arm and control.9,11 The modest 
size of this hypothetical future trial means that graduation occurs only when there is 
compelling evidence of an arm’s efficacy. Accrual to a graduating arm halts immediately, 
but all patients on the arm and its concurrent controls must complete surgery before 
graduation is announced. An experimental arm is dropped for futility if its predictive 
probability of success in a phase 3 trial <10% for all ten signatures. The maximum total 
number of patients assigned to any experimental arm is 120.
I-SPY 2 Eligibility & Enrollment
I-SPY 2 is open to women aged 18 and over, diagnosed with clinical stage II–III disease. 
Patients must have clinically or radiologically measureable disease in the breast, defined as 
> 2.5 cm. If a tumor meets this criteria by clinical exam, the tumor must also be >2 cm by 
imaging. Participants must have no prior cytotoxic treatment for this malignancy, have 
ECOG performance status of 0–1, and agree to consent to core biopsy and MRI. Patients 
with HR+/MP-low tumors are excluded because the potential benefit of chemotherapy is 
lower in patients with lower proliferative tumors and does not justify the risk of exposure 
investigational agents plus chemotherapy6,12
The veliparib/carboplatin (VC) regimen was not assigned to patients with HER2+ tumors 
due to the lack of safety data with trastuzumab.
All patients provide written, informed consent before initiating I-SPY2 screening. If eligible, 
a second consent is obtained after randomized open-label treatment assignment and prior to 
treatment.
Treatment
Participants received weekly paclitaxel at 80 mg/m2 (T) IV for 12 doses alone (control), or 
in combination with an experimental regimen (Figure 1B). Patients randomized to VC 
received 50 mg of veliparib by mouth twice daily for 12 weeks, and carboplatin at AUC 6 on 
weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10, concurrent with weekly paclitaxel. Following paclitaxel +/− VC, all 
patients received doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 (AC) IV every 2 
to 3 weeks for 4 doses, with myeloid growth factor support as appropriate, followed by 
surgery that included axillary node sampling per NCCN and local practice guidelines. 
Radiation and endocrine adjuvant therapy was recommended following surgery using 
standard guidelines. Dose modifications for standard and experimental therapies are listed in 
Supplemental Table 4.

 Assessments
Core biopsy, blood draws and MRI were performed at baseline and 3 weeks after treatment 
began. MRI and blood draws were repeated between chemotherapy regimens and prior to 
surgery. All surgical specimens are evaluated by pathologists trained to assess residual tumor 
burden (RCB)7. Biomarker assessments include the Agendia 70-gene MammaPrint and 
TargetPrint HER2 gene expression using the Agendia 44K full genome microarray and 
reverse phase phosphoprotein array.
Study Oversight
The study was designed by the principal investigators and the I-SPY2 investigators. The 
drug manufacturer supplied the agent that was administered in an outpatient setting. All 
participating sites received institutional review approval. A data safety monitoring board 
meets monthly.
Statistical Considerations
Trial participants are categorized into 8 subtypes based on three biomarkers: HR status, 
HER2 status and MammaPrint High 1 (MP1) or High 2 (MP2) (supplemental Figure 1). The 
cutpoint between MP1 and MP2 is the median (−0.154) of I-SPY 1 participants who fit the 
eligibility criteria for I-SPY 2.(see Supplemental Figure 1)13
Following a Bayesian approach,10,11 at any given time each regimen’s pCR rate has a 
probability distribution within each of the 8 biomarker subtypes. This distribution is based 
on the results for all patients assigned to the regimen and assumes a covariate-adjusted 
logistic model with covariates HER2, HR, and MP statuses. These distributions allow for 
finding the (Bayesian) probability that each regimen is superior to control within each 
subtype. The randomization probabilities are defined in proportion to these probabilities and 
therefore they change over time.
A longitudinal statistical model of MRI volume after 3 and 12 weeks of therapy in 
comparison with baseline improves information about pCR rates via multiple imputation. 
When all patients on the regimen have had surgery MRI volumes are no longer required for 
calculating probabilities of pCR, but they are used to update the longitudinal model.
We report the final Bayesian probability distributions of pCR rates for an experimental 
regimen and its concurrently randomized controls for each signature by providing the 
estimated pCR rates (means of the respective distributions) and 95% probability intervals. 
We do not report the raw data within biomarker subtypes or signatures; our analysis carries 
greater precision than would any raw-data estimate. We provide, for each signature, the final 
probability that the experimental pCR rate is greater than that for control as well as the 
respective predictive probabilities of success in a future trial as described above.
Additional study design details are in Supplemental information.

 RESULTS
Patients and disease characteristics
Patients were eligible to be randomized to VC from May 2010 to July 2012. During this 
period there were 3 to 5 arms (VC, neratinib, trebananib, ganitumumab, control) being 
randomized. A total of 72 patients were randomized to VC and evaluable for the primary 
endpoint; there were 44 concurrently randomized HER2− controls (Figure 1C). Baseline 
characteristics of participants (Table 1) were similar between the experimental and control 
arms. More VC patients (17% vs. 7%) carried a deleterious mutation in BRCA1/2. Two VC 
patients and one control patient did not have surgery; one VC patient withdrew consent prior 
to surgery; all 4 patients were counted as non-pCRs.
Efficacy
VC was eligible to graduate in 3 signatures: HER2-negative, HR-positive/HER2-negative, 
and triple-negative. It graduated in the triple-negative signature (Figure 2, Table 2). Within 
HER2− tumors treated with VC, its estimated pCR rate was 33% (95% probability interval 
(PI) 23–43%), compared to 22% (95% PI 10–35%) in the control arm (Figure 2A). This 
benefit was concentrated in the graduating signature, triple-negative, where the estimated 
pCR rate was 51% (95% PI 36–66%) for those receiving VC vs 26% (95% PI 9–43%) in 
control patients (Figure 2B). The estimated pCR rate in patients with HR+/HER2− breast 
cancer (Figure 2C) was 14% (95% PI 3–25%) for VC compared to 19% (95% PI 5–33%) for 
control.
In the triple-negative subtype, the probability that VC is superior to control is 99%, and its 
probability of statistical success in an equally randomized, phase 3 trial including 300 
patients is 88% (Table 2, Figure 2B).
Toxicity
Selected toxicities by treatment arm are summarized in Table 3; all toxicities >5% are listed 
in Supplemental Table 5. Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity was increased in VC relative to 
control, with 71 vs 2% of patients experiencing neutropenia, 1 vs 0% febrile neutropenia, 21 
vs 0% thrombocytopenia, and 28 vs 0% anemia. Toxicity was also increased during AC in 
those who had received VC, with 12 vs 5% febrile neutropenia, as well as an increase in 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. We cannot specifically ascribe the additional 
toxicities to either carboplatin or veliparib. However, similar toxicities have been observed 
with the addition of carboplatin to standard of care (e.g. CALGB 4060316).
Dose reductions and discontinuations
Dose reductions in paclitaxel, although absent in the control arm, occurred in 23 (32%) VC 
patients. Dose reductions of carboplatin occurred in 34 (48%) patients. During paclitaxel, 13 
patients (18%) discontinued therapy early in the VC arm compared to 2 patients (5%) in the 
control arm. Reasons for discontinuation in the VC arm included toxicity (10), progression 
(1), and patient preference (2). One patient in the control arm discontinued for toxicity, and 
one for progression. One patient discontinued AC after 3 cycles for toxicity in the VC arm, 
and 3 patients discontinued AC early in the control arm (toxicity (2), progression (1)).

 DISCUSSION
I-SPY 2 is a new clinical trial model designed to facilitate rapid evaluation of novel 
therapeutics with identification of biomarkers for definitive subsequent study.6 A goal of I-
SPY 2 is to provide a framework for more rapidly and efficiently testing promising agents 
earlier in the course of disease. Novel agents are added to standard treatment in the 
neoadjuvant setting for patients who present with tumors at high risk for early recurrence. I-
SPY 2 uses adaptive randomization, shared control arms, and allows multiple agents and 
regimens to be tested in a single trial. It is designed to evaluate tumor subsets for 
improvement in the likelihood of pCR. An important objective is to reduce the number of 
patients needed to determine clinical activity of an agent or regimen.4,5
Another goal of I-SPY 2 is to specifically improve the drug development process by 
establishing a link to the potential success of a future phase 3 trial. Predicting a future trial 
that has a substantial chance of being successful establishes a high bar that we believe 
current oncology agents should meet for continued development. Achieving statistical 
significance in a phase II trial is not enough. The target sample size of 300 for a future 
confirmatory neoadjuvant trial is consistent with our goal of identifying sufficient signal in 
I-SPY2 (improvement in pCR rate in the range of 20% over control) such that a moderately 
sized phase 3 trial in the subtype of interest would be successful. However, there is no 
requirement in I-SPY2 for a future trial.
Triple-negative breast cancer is aggressive, putting women at risk for early recurrence and 
death. Those with stage II–III disease who achieve pCR have a marked improvement in 
outcome compared to women with residual disease.3 For example, the advantage in 3-year 
event-free survival is about 30%. Identifying promising combinations that have the potential 
to improve long-term outcomes in this tumor subset is a high priority and is consistent with 
the I-SPY 2 goal of accelerating the pace of getting successful therapies to market.
Two recent randomized neoadjuvant trials have demonstrated improved pCR rates with the 
addition of carboplatin in patients with triple-negative disease. The GeparSixto trial 
randomized 315 patients to receive paclitaxel, non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and 
bevacizumab, with or without carboplatin.15 Significantly more patients receiving 
carboplatin achieved pCR (53% versus 37%, p=0.005). CALGB 40603 randomized 443 
patients to receive paclitaxel with carboplatin and/or bevacizumab, followed by AC16. 
Similar to GeparSixto, the addition of carboplatin significantly increased pCR rate (54% 
versus 41%; p = .0029).
Inhibitors of PARP block DNA single-strand break repair, which can cause the death of 
BRCA (breast cancer susceptibility genes) deficient cells or potentiate the effects of some 
chemotherapy agents independent of BRCA status.17 Preclinical models have demonstrated 
that veliparib, an oral, potent inhibitor of PARP 1/2, significantly potentiates the anti-
neoplastic effect of carboplatin.18
The combination of veliparib plus carboplatin graduated with a signature of triple-negative 
breast cancer (TNBC), with an estimated probability of pCR 52% vs. an estimated control 
rate of 26%. Importantly, our trial showed no improvement in pCR rate in HR+/HER2−

 disease. Our design did not evaluate the individual contributions of veliparib and 
carboplatin, but instead it evaluated a combination of agents that might have maximum 
effect. Based on these data, an ongoing phase 3 neoadjuvant trial is comparing the efficacy 
of standard chemotherapy alone, with carboplatin or with veliparib plus carboplatin in 
TNBC (NCT02032277).
In both GeparSixto15 and CALGB 40603,16 hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity, dose 
modifications and early discontinuation were increased with carboplatin. In the I-SPY 2 VC 
arm we observed rates of toxicities comparable to those observed with carboplatin in 
CALGB 40603. However, we have no ability to ascribe the higher rates in the VC arm to 
either carboplatin or veliparib. In the VC arm, despite increased dose reductions and early 
discontinuation compared to control, estimated pCR rates were higher. The use of VC also 
impacted toxicity during AC, similar to CALGB 40603, with increased hematologic toxicity. 
Despite this, all but one patient completed 4 cycles of AC.
A small number of patients had BRCA mutations in I-SPY 2. By design, adaptive 
randomization increased the number of triple-negative patients assigned to VC in 
comparison with other experimental arms. This may have enriched the group adaptively 
randomized to VC for BRCA mutations. DNA repair deficiencies were evaluated in all 
patients and will be reported separately.
In sum, TNBC patients benefit from VC while patients with HER2−/HR+ tumors do not. 
The experience of VC in I-SPY2 demonstrates the advantage of an adaptively randomized 
phase 2 platform trial for matching therapies with biomarker subsets to better inform the 
design of phase 3 trials. Phase 3 can be more focused and therefore smaller and faster. 
Future patients stand to benefit but trial participants benefit as well by minimizing exposure 
to ineffective therapy.

 Figure 1A. I-SPY 2 Adaptive Design
Figure 1A illustrates the steps within the I-SPY 2 adaptive process. When new patients are 
enrolled, their subtypes are assessed. As patients are randomized, their outcomes are used to 
update the Bayesian co-variate adjusted model which computes the predictive probability of 
success in phase 3 for each signature. Pre-defined termination rules are applied for each 
experimental arm to determine whether it should stop for futility, graduate, or continue, 
adding on additional experimental arms if accrual permitting. As the trial continues, for each 
experimental arm, the probability of superiority over control within each subtype is updated; 
and the randomization probabilities for each subtype into the various experimental arms are 
adapted (such that new patients entering the trial will be more likely to be randomized to an 
agent showing activity within their subtype).

 Figure 1B. I-SPY 2 Study Design
Patients are screened for I-SPY 2 eligibility. Eligible patients are adaptively randomized to 
12 weekly paclitaxel (and trastuzumab if HER2+) cycles (control) or in combination with 
one of several experimental agents followed by doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) × 4, 
with serial biomarkers (biopsies, blood draw and MRI scans) assessed over the course of 
their therapy. Only patients with HER2− disease were randomized to the veliparib/
carboplatin arm.

 Figure 1C. I-SPY 2 Consort Diagram for veliparib/carboplatin arm and its concurrent control
Only patients with HER2-negative disease were eligible for randomization to the VC arm. 
Patients were categorized as received allocated invention if they received at least one dose of 
experimental (or control) therapy.

Estimated pCR Rate for the signatures evaluated for V/C vs. concurrent HER2-negative 
control.
2A. Probability distribution for all patients with HER2-negative disease; 2B. Probability 
distribution for patients with TNBC (HR-negative/HER2-negative); 2C. Probability 
distribution for patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative disease. The red curves represent 
patients treated with V/C plus paclitaxel followed by AC, and the blue curves represent 
concurrent controls. The corresponding 95% probability distributions (represented by the 
width of the curve) are shown for each. The mean of each distribution is the estimated pCR 
rate.
