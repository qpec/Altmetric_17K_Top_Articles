Objective: To compare bariatric surgery outcomes according to preoperative mental illness category.
Methods: Electronic health record data from several US healthcare systems were used to compare out-
comes of four groups of patients who underwent bariatric surgery in 2012 and 2013. These included the
following: people with (1) no mental illness, (2) mild-to-moderate depression or anxiety, (3) severe depres-
sion or anxiety, and (4) bipolar, psychosis, or schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Groups were compared
on weight loss trajectory using generalized estimating equations using B-spline bases and on all-cause
emergency department visits and hospital days using zero-inflated Poisson and negative binomial regres-
sion up to 2 years after surgery. Models were adjusted for demographic and health covariates, including
baseline healthcare use.
Results: Among 8,192 patients, mean age was 44.3 (10.7) years, 79.9% were female, and 45.6% were
white. Fifty-seven percent had preoperative mental illness. There were no differences between groups for
weight loss, but patients with preoperative severe depression or anxiety or bipolar, psychosis, or
schizophrenia spectrum disorders had higher follow-up levels of emergency department visits and hospi-
tal days compared to those with no mental illness.
Conclusions: In this multicenter study, mental illness was not associated with differential weight loss
after bariatric surgery, but additional research could focus on reducing acute care use among these
patients.

Introduction
Mental illness is highly prevalent among bariatric surgery patients,
with estimates ranging from 23% to 68% of patients affected preop-
eratively (1-3). Opinions vary regarding whether such patients are
good candidates for bariatric surgery (4-6), reflecting uncertainty
about their long-term weight loss and risk of complications.
There are several reasons that patients with mental illness might
experience less weight loss after bariatric surgery, including behav-
ioral aspects of some mental illnesses that could predispose to weight
regain (e.g., diminished impulse control) (7) and the weight gain-
promoting nature of many psychiatric medications (8). Research find-
ings on this topic are mixed; some studies have concluded that
patients with mood or anxiety disorders experience less weight loss
following bariatric surgery (3,9), while others have shown no differ-
ence in weight loss according to mental illness status (10,12).
Research on postbariatric surgical safety and mental illness is also
limited. Studies in these areas have used differing definitions of
mental illness and have had limited ability to control for variables
that might affect safety and healthcare use outcomes (1). Studies
from the broader field of surgical literature have suggested that
patients with mental illness may be at risk of greater acute care use
following surgery. For example, surgical patients with depression
may experience worse pain and increased risk of postoperative mor-
tality (13), and those with severe mental illness have been shown to
be at increased risk of rehospitalization, relative to patients with no
mental illness (14).

CLINICAL TRIALS AND INVESTIGATIONS
Obesity
 We conducted a retrospective cohort study with more than 8,000 bariat-
ric patients across seven US healthcare systems in the Patient Outcomes
Research to Advance Learning (PORTAL) network, using electronic
health record (EHR) data to address the impact of mental illness on
weight loss and acute healthcare use after surgery. The primary hypoth-
esis was that patients with mental illness, particularly those with more
severe mental illness, would have less weight loss and higher postoper-
ative acute care use compared to patients with no mental illness.
Methods
Healthcare systems and data sources
The data sources for this study were EHR records abstracted from
the PORTAL overweight and obesity cohort, a collaborative data
effort across seven integrated health insurance and care-delivery sys-
tems in the United States (15,16). Data elements include member-
ship status, demographics, vital signs, healthcare use, laboratory val-
ues, and pharmacy orders. This cohort included data from Kaiser
Permanente healthcare systems (Northern California, Southern Cali-
fornia, Colorado, Northwest, Hawaii, Georgia, Mid-Atlantic), Den-
ver Health, Health Partners, and Group Health. The study was
approved by the Kaiser Permanente Southern California IRB, with
other sites ceding primary review to this board.
Study population
We included adults 18 to 64 years old who underwent an initial
bariatric surgical procedure in one of the represented healthcare
systems between January 2012 and December 2013 and had at
least 6 months of preoperative enrollment. Patients were required
to have a documented BMI of �30 kg/m2 within 6 months prior to
surgery (accounting for preoperative weight loss by patients ini-
tially qualified with BMI �35) and no codes for revisional proce-
dures in the same time period (Supporting Information Figure S1).
For inclusion in body weight outcome analyses, patients were
required to have at least two postoperative BMI measurements.
Most of the included patients in our study came from systems that
conduct preoperative screening for mental illness to assess stabil-
ity prior to surgery.
Exposure
Because patients with more serious mental illness could theoretically
have different outcomes compared to those with mild depression,
exposure categories were created to identify clinically similar groups
of patients. All psychiatric diagnoses and medications up to 2 years
before surgery were abstracted. Preoperative mental illness status
was then categorized as one of the following: no (or unspecified)
mental
illness
(NMI),
mild-to-moderate
depression
or
anxiety
(MDA), severe depression or anxiety (SDA), or bipolar, psychotic,
and schizophrenia spectrum disorder (BPSD). A detailed overview
of the algorithm is provided in the online supplement (Supporting
Information Figure S2).
In brief, patients with diagnoses indicating depression or anxiety, or
those prescribed antidepressant, anxiolytic, or hypnotic medications,
were classified as having MDA. Patients with codes for more severe
depression, or those taking a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic for
their depression, were categorized as having SDA. Patients were
placed into the BPSD group if they had a corresponding diagnosis
code or were taking antipsychotic medications, lithium, or mood sta-
bilizers for one of these conditions. If an individual qualified for
more than one exposure category, he or she was placed into the
most serious category for which he or she qualified.
Some medication classes in our algorithm could be used for non-
psychiatric indications. If individuals were found to be on such med-
ications with no psychiatric diagnosis, but did have an alternate indi-
cation (e.g., amitriptyline with a diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy),
they were classified in the NMI category.
Outcomes
Change in weight after surgery was the primary outcome, expressed
both as percent total weight loss (%TWL) and change in BMI (kg/
m2) from baseline, the former calculated as 100% 3 (presurgery
BMI 2 current BMI) 4 presurgery BMI (17). Weight loss was
examined only among patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric
bypass (RYGB) or vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) (N 5 8,059),
at 2 years after surgery or at the end of available follow-up.
Secondary outcomes assessed acute healthcare use after surgery,
measured by two indicators: number of all-cause emergency depart-
ment (ED) visits at 3,12, and 24 months after surgery and number
of all-cause hospital days at the same time points.
Covariates
Covariates were selected based on variables known to correlate with
mental health diagnosis and treatment (18-21) and with our outcomes
of interest. Statistical models included EHR-derived covariates: sex
(male, female), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic
white,
non-Hispanic
black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or other), age (years), preoper-
ative BMI (kg/m2), preoperative diagnosis of hypertension and diabe-
tes, preoperative Charlson Index score (0, 1, or� 2) (22), insurance
type (private, Medicare, or Medicaid), language preference (written
and spoken English or not), healthcare system in which patient was
enrolled, and number of ED visits and hospital days in the 6 months
prior to surgery. Procedure type (RYGB, VSG, laparoscopic adjusta-
ble gastric band, or other) was a covariate in healthcare use models
and a stratifying variable in weight loss models.
We used geocoded demographic information for area-level measures
of poverty (percentage of households in census block below poverty
level: < 5%, 5%-<10%, 10%-<20%, or > 20%) and education (per-
centage of households in census block with less than high school
education: < 15%, 15%-<25%, 25%-<40%) (23). Area-level socio-
economic status measures were included as covariates despite our
cohort of insured patients because these measures have been shown
to predict lower treatment adherence in other realms, such as hyper-
tension therapy, even in insured populations (24). Educational and
poverty information was missing for 162 (2.0%) and 177 (2.2%) of
the sample, respectively, and missing values were imputed using the
region-specific means of nonmissing values. Sensitivity analyses
were conducted by removing patients with imputed census covari-
ates to confirm there was no effect on estimates.
Statistical analysis
Weight.
Weight measures were collected as part of clinical care;
therefore, the number and timing of the measures varied from one

851
 patient to another. Because this variability could bias results if some
patients contributed more data, and through intra-individual correla-
tions among multiple measures, we employed generalized estimating
equation models that used “inverse intensity of visit process-weights”
(25). To account for uncertainty in weight estimates, %TWL and
BMI trajectories over time were estimated from 200 bootstrap repli-
cates of each model. Separate B-spline basis functions were created
for each mental health category to capture the nonlinearity of these
outcomes over time (25). To graphically portray these trends, model
covariates were set to the mean values for continuous variables and
mode for categorical variables (Figure 1 and Supporting Information
Figure S3). All covariates listed in Table 1, with the exception of pro-
cedure type, were included in the models. Because bariatric procedure
type is one of the strongest determinants of weight loss (26), we sepa-
rately analyzed patients undergoing RYGB and VSG, which together
represented over 97% of our sample.
Healthcare use.
We used zero-inflated Poisson models for ED use
and zero-inflated negative binomial models for hospital use (27). Zero
models were deemed necessary because the majority of patients did
not require acute care, especially during the 3-month postoperative
time period, leading to a high proportion of zero counts in these out-
comes. These models (zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated negative
binomial models) allowed us to (1) determine how likely an individ-
ual was to utilize acute care at all (likelihood of having zero use ver-
sus any use) using a logit model to estimate odds ratios (OR) and (2)
determine, given any use during a time period, how much an
individual would utilize acute care, using a Poisson or negative bino-
mial distribution to estimate incident rate ratios (IRRs) (27). The NMI
group served as the reference category for all analyses. All covariates
in Table 1 were included in models for healthcare use outcomes.
Sensitivity analyses.
For healthcare use outcomes, sensitivity
analyses on the subset of patients with �2 years of follow-up were
conducted to determine if patients who dropped out before 24
months were systematically different from those with complete
follow-up. Inverse intensity of visit process-weights adjusted for
these possible biases in the weight analyses.
To examine whether we over- or under-adjusted for baseline health-
care use trends, additional sensitivity analyses were conducted in
which we removed from our models the terms corresponding to
baseline (6 months preoperative) ED and hospital use, and also in
which we instead included terms corresponding to a full 12 months
of baseline ED and hospital use.
Finally, we ran sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of excluding
patients from our mental illness categories who were on psychiatric
medications (e.g., a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) but had
no accompanying psychiatric diagnosis code to evaluate for possibly
misclassifying these individuals in our main analysis.
Statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.2.3 and SAS
version 9.3.
Results
Population characteristics
The sample consisted of 8,192 bariatric surgical patients with a
median postoperative enrollment span of 2.9 years (83.5% of sample
had � 24 months follow-up). Mean (standard deviation) age at sur-
gery was 44.3 (10.7) years, 79.9% were female, and 45.6% were
non-Hispanic white. Patients had a mean (standard deviation) preop-
erative BMI of 43.7 (7.0) kg/m2, and over half underwent VSG
(59.8%), with 37.4% having RYGB and 2.7% other procedure types.
Slightly less than half of the sample (43%) had no evidence of men-
tal illness as specified by our algorithm, while 44% were classified
as having MDA, 6% as having SDA, and 6% as having BPSD.
There were significant baseline differences between mental illness
categories for most covariates (Table 1).
Change in weight following surgery
There was no significant difference across mental health catego-
ries for change in %TWL (Figure 1) or BMI (Supporting Informa-
tion Figure S3). The BMI change nadir for VSG patients with
NMI (reference group) was 210.8 kg/m2 (95% CI 211.3 to
210.3), with a corresponding maximum %TWL of 25.0% (95%
CI 23.9 to 26.2), occurring approximately 12 months after surgery.
Among RYGB patients with NMI, the BMI change nadir occurred
at about 13 months postoperatively and was 213.7 kg/m2 (95% CI
213.1 to 214.4), with a corresponding maximum %TWL of
31.6% (95% CI 30.1 to 33.0). Estimates for other mental health
categories were very similar, with 95% confidence intervals (CI)
overlapping at every time point.

modeled %TWL trajectory for vertical sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric
bypass patients, respectively, assuming mean values on continuous baseline cova-
riates and modal values for categorical covariates. The curves within each graph
represent the mental illness categorizations as we characterized them: no mental
illness, mild-to-moderate depression or anxiety, severe depression, or anxiety or
bipolar/psychosis/schizophrenia. There were no significant differences in %TWL tra-
jectory between mental health categories.

 ED visits
Patients with BPSD were 40% less likely (OR [95% CI] 0.6 [0.38-
0.85]) than those with NMI to have zero ED visits by 3 months after
surgery, and this pattern continued at 1 and 2 years of follow-up
(Table 2). Among the subset of patients with any ED visits, patients
with BPSD had 70% more ED visits than those with NMI at 1 and
2 years after surgery (year 1 IRR [95% CI] 1.7 [1.47-1.92]; Table
3).
Patients with SDA were also less likely to have zero ED visits than
patients with NMI in years 1 and 2 after surgery (year 1: OR [95% CI]
0.7 [0.52-0.94]; year 2 OR [95% CI] 0.6 [0.42-0.74]; Table 2). In
count models among patients with any ED visits, those with SDA had
more ED visits than those with NMI at all three time points in follow-
up (3 months: IRR [95% CI] 1.4 [1.11-1.87]; year 1: IRR [95% CI]
1.6 [1.34-1.80]; year 2: IRR [95% CI] 1.7 [1.50-1.85]; Table 3).
Patients with MDA had lower odds of zero ED visits compared to
those with NMI only at the year 1 time point (OR [95% CI] 0.8
[0.7-0.97]; Table 2). But among those with any ED visits, patients
with MDA had more ED visits relative to those with NMI in every
examined time period (3 months: IRR [95% CI] 1.2 (1.04-1.45);
year 1: IRR [95% CI] 1.4 [1.25-1.51]; year 2: IRR [95% CI] 1.5
[1.36-1.56]; Table 3).
Hospital days
At years 1 and 2 after surgery, but not at 3 months, patients with
BPSD were less likely to have zero hospital days compared to those
with NMI (year 1: OR [95% CI] 0.5 [0.29-0.68]; year 2: OR [95%
CI] 0.4 [0.21-0.62]; Table 2). Among the subset of patients with any
hospital days, there was no risk of increased hospital days for these
patients relative to those with NMI (count models, Table 3).
Patients with SDA were also less likely than those with NMI to
have zero hospital days at every postoperative time point (3 months:
OR [95% CI] 0.5 [0.28-0.78]; year 1: OR [95% CI] 0.4 [0.27-0.59];
year 2: OR [95% CI] 0.3 [0.17-0.55]; Table 2). Count models
showed no significant difference in number of hospital days between
those with SDA and those with NMI (Table 3).

 Patients with MDA were less likely to have zero hospital days at
the 2-year postoperative mark but at no other time point (year 2:
OR [95% CI] 0.7 [0.56-0.91]; Table 2). Count models for those with
MDA revealed a higher number of hospital days relative to those
with NMI at all three time points (3 months: IRR [95% CI] 1.6
[1.12-2.43]; year 1: IRR [95% CI] 1.4 [1.06-1.74]; year 2: IRR
[95% CI] 1.3 [1.02-1.59]; Table 3).
Sensitivity analyses
Hospital and ED use analyses limited to patients with at least 2 years
of follow-up were conducted and showed no differences from our
main analysis at any of the three time points. Sensitivity analyses to
examine the impact of adjusting for baseline healthcare use were also
performed for the ED and hospital outcomes (Supporting Information
Tables S1 and S2). Models not adjusted for preoperative healthcare
use exhibited an amplified relationship between mental illness and
postoperative healthcare use. We also conducted both weight and
healthcare use sensitivity analyses in which we excluded individuals
who were on psychiatric medications but had no associated diagnosis
code (n 5 1,251; Supporting Information Figures S3-S4) and observed
no major differences in our findings.
Discussion
In this study of more than 8,000 bariatric surgical patients from a
geographically diverse group of US healthcare systems, patients
with preoperative mental illness, even those with serious mental ill-
ness such as bipolar, psychotic, and schizophrenia spectrum disor-
der, had very similar weight loss compared to those with no preop-
erative mental illness. However, preoperative mental illness was
predictive of greater acute care use, specifically more ED visits and
hospital days, beginning as soon as 3 months after surgery and per-
sisting through 2 years of follow-up. The likelihood of acute care
use often increased with the seriousness of mental illness.
The finding that mental illness status did not impact weight loss tra-
jectory adds significantly to the existing literature in this area, in
which conflicting results have been reported. Kalarchian et al., for
example, reported less weight loss following RYGB among patients
with a lifetime history of mood or anxiety disorder (3), whereas
some other cohort studies have not identified such a pattern (10-12).
This may in part be due to whether one examines early (e.g. 6
months) versus longer-term (e.g., 21 years) follow-up and focuses
on pre- or postoperative mental illness. White et al., for example,
found that postoperative depression was linked to suboptimal weight
loss early after surgery but that these differences disappeared by 2
years postoperatively (28). Importantly, the amount and timing of
weight loss observed in our sample was similar to what has been
reported previously for patients undergoing VSG and RYGB (25).
There is limited evidence to which we can compare study findings
regarding acute care use across mental illness categories. One 2009
study of complications and hospital readmissions up to 6 months after
RYGB observed no statistically significant differences between patient
groups according to preoperative presence of mood or eating disorders
(10). Another study found strong correlation between preoperative
mental illness and one’s risk of not attending postoperative follow-up,
as well as not adhering with postoperative behavioral guidelines (5),
both of which could place patients at increased risk of need for acute
care services. We observed increased rates of ED and hospital serv-
ices across all mental illness categories, although the odds of use (and
amount of use) often appeared more elevated in patients with the
most severe forms of mental illness. There were only a few excep-
tions to this pattern, such as the case of count models for ED visits
and hospital days, in which the more severe categories of mental ill-
ness did not always exhibit statistically significant differences in risk
compared to no (or unspecified) mental illness. This was possibly
related to sample size in these smaller subgroups, particularly for
count models.
The clinical implications of our findings for practicing surgeons are
important to highlight. First, the finding of similar weight loss
across groups suggests that patients with a history of mental illness
can benefit equally from surgical treatment of obesity. In the health
systems from which the majority of our data was derived, recom-
mendations for preoperative assessments focus on the stability of a
patient’s mental health condition more than on diagnosis type.
Recently released American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Sur-
gery Guidelines for presurgical psychosocial screening underscore
the importance of a focus on stability of illness and symptom con-
trol in considering how an individual might handle the postoperative
period (29). The patients in our sample are therefore unlikely to be
those with active or unstable disease, which has important implica-
tions for the generalizability of our results. Study findings should
not be taken as an indication to liberalize mental health clearance
criteria to unstable patients. Our finding of increased acute care use
in patients with mental illness should be considered during the pro-
cess of consenting patients for surgery and also postoperatively.
Additional research is needed to explore the reasons for ED visits
and hospitalizations to determine their relatedness to surgery.
One limitation of our study is that we used EHR diagnosis and treat-
ment data to categorize mental illnesses, which may have misclassi-
fied some patients. It is reassuring, however, that a similar overall
proportion of patients with mental illness was identified in our study
compared to studies that used rigorous prospective methods, includ-
ing structured interviews (1-3,30). Routine psychological screening
of bariatric candidates may account for this, as it likely results in
better coding for mental health conditions than in a nonbariatric
EHR sample.
Notably, the mental illness categories used in this study did not
address isolated Axis II diagnoses (personality disorders), eating dis-
orders, or substance use disorders, which may have an impact on the
outcomes examined but which are not typically as well coded in
health records as mood disorders or other Axis I conditions—hence,
the nomenclature of “no (or unspecified) mental illness” for our ref-
erence category.
We did not examine cause-specific healthcare use after surgery (i.e.,
we cannot determine that increased ED visits among mental illness
patients are related directly to bariatric surgery, as opposed to sim-
ply being due to underlying mental illness). We tried to mitigate
this factor by including baseline ED and hospital use as continuous
covariates in our models. In other words, if patients with mental ill-
ness are simply higher consumers of acute care, this pattern should
exist prior to surgery (and did—see Table 1). We cannot be certain
whether we had sufficient baseline data to fully address or adjust for
this issue, although our sensitivity analysis adjusting for one full
year of baseline produced very similar results to the main analysis.

 Although no differences in weight loss were observed between
groups at 2 years, weight regain trajectories may differ with longer
follow-up. Likewise, we did not examine weight loss after less com-
mon bariatric procedure types, such as adjustable gastric banding or
duodenal switch. We also did not examine whether one procedure
type might be preferable for patients with mental illness.
Conclusion
In a large retrospective cohort study of geographically diverse US
bariatric surgical patients, we found that preoperative mental illness
did not predict differential weight loss up to 2 years after VSG or
RYGB. Our study population represented a group that, despite men-
tal illness history, had been cleared for surgery due to a clinical
judgment that they were stable preoperatively. Those with mental
illness in our cohort, particularly severe mental illness, were much
more likely to require ED and hospital use after surgery. This find-
ing underscores the need to explore tailored, supportive postopera-
tive outreach to minimize the risk of adverse health outcomes
among patients with known mental illness. The format of such out-
reach programs and their optimal content and timing will be impor-
tant topics for future research.O
