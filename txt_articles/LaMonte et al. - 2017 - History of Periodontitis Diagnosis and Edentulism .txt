Background-—Few studies have reported associations between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in older
women, which is the objective of the present investigation.
Methods and Results-—Participants were 57 001 postmenopausal women ages 55 to 89 years (mean 68 years; >85% 60 and
older) who were enrolled (1993–1998) in the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study, and were without known CVD when
history of periodontitis and edentulism was assessed by questionnaire at study Year-5 (1998–2003). There were 3589 incident
CVD events and 3816 total deaths during a mean follow-up of 6.7 years. In multivariable analysis, periodontitis was not associated
with CVD events, but was associated with higher total mortality (hazard ratio (HR)=1.12, 95% CI: 1.05–1.21). Edentulism was
associated with higher age- and smoking-adjusted risks of CVD (HR=1.42, 95% CI: 1.27–1.59) and mortality (HR=1.47, 95% CI:
1.32–1.63). Further adjustment eliminated the association with CVD, but mortality remained significantly increased (HR=1.17, 95%
CI: 1.02–1.33). Stratification on age, race-ethnicity, smoking, and diabetes mellitus yielded comparable results; however,
edentulism was more strongly associated with CVD in women reporting ≥1 dental visit (HR=1.57) compared with <1 visit (HR 1.03,
interaction P=0.004) annually.
Conclusions-—In community-dwelling older women, edentulism was associated with increased risks of CVD and total mortality,
and presence of periodontitis, which is more prevalent than edentulism, was associated with 17% higher mortality rate. These
findings suggest that improving periodontal condition of the general population could reduce overall mortality. (J Am Heart Assoc.

eriodontitis is a chronic inflammatory condition and a
major cause of tooth loss in adults.1 Moderate to severe
periodontitis and edentulism are present in about 64% and
33% of US adults 60 years and older, respectively.2,3
Periodontitis and tooth loss have been associated with higher
risks of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD)4,5 and
total mortality.6–10 Few studies have included older adults or
specifically women, and in those that have, inconsistent
results were reported.8,11–13 Further understanding the rela-

 mortality is relevant to health and population aging. We
examined these associations in a prospective cohort of older
postmenopausal women.
Methods
Study Participants
Participants were women ages 50 to 79 who enrolled in the
Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study (OS) at
40 US centers from 1993 through 1998 as detailed
elsewhere.14,15 History of periodontitis diagnosis was ascer-
tained using the WHI OS Year-5 follow-up questionnaire.16 Of
the 93 676 women enrolled in the WHI OS, 70 134 were
without known CVD at Year-5, and 62 335 of them responded
to the Year-5 questionnaire. Women who had omitted dental
health questions (n=401), were lost to follow-up after Year-5
(n=570), or missing covariable information (n=4363) were
excluded, resulting in an analytic sample of 57 001. The
Institutional Review Boards at participating study centers
regularly reviewed and approved all study protocols. Partic-
ipants provided written informed consent to all aspects of the
WHI OS.
Assessment of Periodontitis and Edentulism
Periodontitis was assessed by asking “Has a dentist or dental
hygienist ever told you that you had periodontal or gum
disease?”. Additional questions were, “During the past
3 years, how often have you gone to the dentist or dental
hygienist for routine check-ups or cleaning?” and “Have you
lost all of your permanent teeth (edentulism), both upper and
lower?”. Self-reported periodontitis diagnosis is reported
accurately in this cohort. Prevalence of self-reported peri-
odontitis diagnosis was 13%, 24%, and 56% among women
grouped on standardized clinical categories of none/mild,
moderate, and severe periodontitis (j=0.27), defined by
objective probing measures in a subset of 992 WHI OS
participants.16 When compared to a criterion clinical measure
of tooth loss due to periodontitis, accuracy of self-reported
history of periodontal/gum disease diagnosis was comparable
across age groups (<65 years: Sensitivity 0.81, Specificity
0.76; ≥65 years: Sensitivity 0.74, Specificity 0.80) and level
of education attained (high school: Sensitivity 0.79, Specificity
0.76; college: Sensitivity 0.76, Specificity 0.80). In a separate
cohort of older adults (≥55 years) comparable in demograph-
ics to the women in the present study, reproducibility of self-
reported dental conditions including gum disease and tooth
extraction, across 2 administrations separated by 2 years was
similarly high in those 55 to 64 years (j=0.82), and in those
≥65 (j=0.80); reproducibility did not differ by sex.17 Because
the history of periodontitis diagnosis was self-reported as a
yes or no response, we are not able to evaluate whether risks
of study outcomes differed according to severity of periodon-
titis (eg, moderate compared to severe disease).
Assessment of Covariables
Information on demographics, health behaviors, medical
conditions, and medication use was collected using question-
naires at WHI OS entry. When available, information updated
prior to Year-5 is used here. Because smoking is strongly
associated with periodontitis and tooth loss,18,19 adequate
consideration of smoking is needed when evaluating relation-
ships with CVD. Smoking status (never, former, current) and
cigarettes smoked per day were assessed at baseline and
updated annually. Pack-years was computed by multiplying
packs smoked per day by number of years smoked. Other
potential confounding factors included age (years), educa-
tional level (≤high school, college/some college, postgradu-
ate), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, black, other), body
mass index (kg/m2), waist–hip ratio, recreational physical
activity (total metabolic equivalent hours per week), dietary
healthy eating index, alcohol consumption (gram servings per
week), age at menopause, hormone therapy use (never user,
former user, current user), and history of diagnosed or treated
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia (yes,
no each). The specific measurements, procedures, and
reliability
of
these
factors
have

described

where.14,15
Ascertainment of End Points
Follow-up through December 2010 for clinical outcomes was
performed annually in the WHI OS, as previously detailed.20
The primary end point for this analysis was incident total CVD
(nonfatal myocardial infarction, cardiac death, stroke, pul-
monary embolism, heart failure). Coronary heart disease
(myocardial infarction and cardiac death) and ischemic stroke
also were evaluated separately. Events were identified on the
basis of annual mailed follow-up questionnaires (response
rates >95%) and, when possible, medical record review using
standard case definitions.20 Physicians blinded to exposure
data adjudicated self-reported diagnoses and clinical records,
which, in a WHI substudy,21 showed good agreement for
myocardial infarction (Sensitivity=80%, j=0.64), stroke (Sen-
sitivity=82%, j=0.76), heart failure (Sensitivity=79%, j=0.56),
and pulmonary embolism (Sensitivity=82%, j=0.84).
Total mortality was defined as death from any cause
identified as part of routine participant follow-up that included
reports from family/next of kin, obituaries, and National
Death Index searches. Death certificates and hospital records
were obtained and then centrally adjudicated by reviewers
blinded to study component. For many out-of-hospital deaths,

 documentation relied on the death certificate and the most
recent relevant hospitalization before death.
Statistical Analysis
Follow-up time was computed for each participant from the
date of Year-5 questionnaire completion (1998–2003) to the
date of CVD diagnosis, death, loss to follow-up, or end of
follow-up (September 30, 2010), for which the mean (SD) was
6.7 (2.7) years. Cox proportional hazards regression was used
to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI for crude and
multivariable-adjusted models. A parsimonious model-building
approach was utilized to maximize statistical power and
reduce the probability of bias. Adjustments started with age
(years) and smoking (status and pack-years) as done in other
epidemiologic studies on periodontitis,12,22 then added dental
visit frequency, history of diabetes mellitus, and other factors
relevant to CVD risk. Stratified analyses and cross-product
regression terms were used to evaluate whether associations
varied appreciably across prespecified cohort subgroups. The
proportional hazards assumption was evaluated by visual
inspection of cumulative hazard plots grouped on exposures;
no appreciable violations were noted. The impact of subclin-
ical disease at baseline was evaluated by excluding the first
year of follow-up; little change was noted. P-values are for
2-sided hypothesis tests at a=0.05.
Results
Characteristics of the cohort are shown in Table 1. Overall,
the mean age was 68.1 years and the majority was non-
Hispanic white with at least some college education. About
half the cohort was overweight or obese and two thirds
reported ever using hormone therapy. Prevalence of major
CVD risk factors was 4.1%, 5.0%, 36.7%, and 11.9% for current
smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholes-
terolemia, respectively.
The
prevalence
of
periodontitis
diagnosis
was
26%
(Table 1). Because of the large cohort size, many of the
comparisons between women with and without periodontitis
were statistically significant although differences were small.
Women with periodontitis tended to be younger, more
educated, consume more alcohol, and have higher frequency
of dental visits and lower frequency of edentulism as
compared with women without periodontitis (P<0.05, all).
The only significant differences in CVD risk factors were for
slightly lower frequency of hypertension and higher frequency
of current smoking in women with periodontitis (P<0.05, all).
Mean age at menopause was somewhat higher in those with
than without periodontitis (P=0.02). Hormone therapy use
was comparable between groups.
The cohort prevalence of edentulism was 5.9% (Table 1).
Edentulous women were older, less educated and physically
active, consumed less alcohol and a less healthy diet, visited
the dentist less frequently, and had lower frequency of
periodontitis compared to dentate women (P<0.001, all). CVD
risk factors were significantly worse among edentulous
women, with nearly 35% being obese and prevalence of
current smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyper-
cholesterolemia being 10.5%, 10.8%, 46.7%, and 14.5%,
respectively (P<0.001, all). Edentulous women had a lower
mean age at menopause and were more frequently never
hormone users (P<0.001, each).
The mean time to event or censoring was 6.8 and
6.7 years
in
women
with
and
without
periodontitis
(P<0.001), and 6.0 and 6.8 years in edentulous and dentate
women (P<0.001). There were 3816 total deaths (819 CVD)
and 3589 total CVD events identified. Rates and hazard ratios
of study outcomes according to periodontitis and edentulous
status are shown in Table 2. Crude rates (per 1000 person
years) of total CVD, CHD, and stroke in women with and
without periodontitis were 9.4 and 9.4 (P=0.94), 4.4 and 4.3
(P=0.93), and 2.2 and 2.1 (P=0.78), respectively. Following
adjustment for age, smoking status, and pack-years, relative
hazards (95% CI) for these end point comparisons were 1.01
(0.94–1.09), 1.02 (0.91–1.14), and 1.08 (0.93–1.26). Further
adjustment for dental visits and diabetes mellitus, and for
demographic and CVD risk factors did not materially change
these associations or their lack of statistical significance.
The crude rate for total mortality was significantly higher in
women with (10.5) than without (9.4, P=0.005) periodontitis.
The age- and smoking-adjusted relative hazard was 1.08
(1.00–1.16, P=0.042) and was 1.12 (1.05–1.21) after further
adjustment for dental visits and diabetes mellitus. This higher
relative hazard associated with periodontitis persisted with
additional adjustments. Crude rates of CVD mortality were 2.0
and 2.1 in those with and without periodontitis (P=0.69). CVD
mortality was not associated with periodontitis in adjusted
regression models.
Crude rates for total CVD (16.6 versus 9.0, P<0.001), CHD
(8.1 versus 4.1, P<0.001), and stroke (2.7 versus 2.1,
P=0.063) were higher in edentulous compared with dentate
women. Age- and smoking-adjusted relative hazards for this
comparison were significantly higher for total CVD (HR=1.42,
95% CI: 1.27–1.59) and CHD (HR=1.47, 95% CI: 1.25–1.73),
but not for stroke (HR=0.97, 95% CI: 0.74–1.28). These
associations were not statistically significant after further
adjustment.
Edentulous women had significantly higher crude rates of
total mortality (18.9 versus 9.2, P<0.001) and CVD mortality
(4.5 versus 2.0, P<0.001) compared with dentate women.
Age- and smoking-adjusted hazard ratios remained signifi-
cantly elevated for both total mortality (HR=1.47, 95% CI:

 1.32–1.63) and CVD mortality (HR=1.59, 95% CI: 1.28–1.98).
Fully adjusted hazard ratios were attenuated but remained
statistically significant for total mortality (HR=1.17, 95% CI:
1.02–1.33) but not for CVD mortality (HR=1.07, 95% CI: 0.81–
1.40).
Stratified associations are shown in Tables 3 and 4. After
adjusting for age and smoking, there were no appreciable
differences in magnitude or significance of associations
between periodontitis and either CVD risk or total mortality
across categories of age, race-ethnicity, smoking pack-years,
history of diabetes mellitus, or frequency of dental visits
(interaction P>0.05, all). There was a stronger association
between edentulism and CVD among women who visited the
dentist at least once per year (HR=1.57) compared with less
than once per year (HR=1.03, interaction P=0.004). Results
were similar for stratified associations between edentulism
and total mortality (HR=1.63 for visits ≥1 per year; HR=1.08
for visits <1 per year; interaction P=0.002).
In sensitivity analysis (data not shown), in participant
subsets where information was available, adjustment for
self-rated health status, depression, and use of statins did not
materially change the primary findings. To further explore
potential diagnostic ascertainment bias, associations were
stratified on finer groupings of dental visit frequency.
Subgroups tended to have limited sample size. Comparable
hazard ratios for total CVD and mortality were seen for
periodontitis diagnosis across all levels of dental visit
frequency. Higher risks of total CVD and total mortality
persisted in edentulous women with more frequent dental
visits, as seen in the main analysis. Lastly, we explored
disease risks according to jointly classified periodontitis and
edentulism exposures. Sample sizes and CVD event counts
were particularly small for the exposure group in which
women reported being positive for both periodontitis and
edentulism (N=682; 12 strokes, 13 CVD deaths, 30 CHD
cases), which limited statistical power and precision of results
in this subgroup. For the total mortality outcome, for which
end point counts are largest (93 deaths in those reporting
“yes” to both exposure questions), results showed the highest
risk in women reporting both periodontitis and edentulism.

Periodontitis and CVD in Women
LaMonte et al
ORIGINAL RESEARCH

 Compared to women with neither exposure (referent), the
multivariable adjusted HR (95% CI) was 1.46 (1.17, 1.81)
among women with both exposures present; 1.12 (0.97, 1.30)
for women reporting no periodontitis/yes edentulism; and
was 1.11 (1.03, 1.20) for women reporting yes periodontitis/
no edentulism.
Discussion
Accumulating evidence strongly suggests a biological link
between periodontitis and atherosclerotic CVD, but few
studies have evaluated this hypothesis in older women. In
our study of postmenopausal women, 1 in 4 reported a history
periodontitis
diagnosis which
was
not
associated
with
elevated risks of CVD events or CVD mortality. Edentulism,
however, was associated with significantly higher risks of total
CVD and CHD, and CVD mortality. These increased risks were
robust to adjustment for confounding and were generally
consistent across cohort subgroups. An association was not
seen with ischemic stroke, though case counts were relatively
small for this end point. Total mortality risk also was
significantly higher in women with either edentulism or
periodontitis even when adjusted for confounding. The
association for edentulism with total CVD and mortality
appeared stronger in women who reported more frequent
dental visits. Because edentulism may be a more objective
reflection of periodontal health than self-reported periodon-
titis diagnosis,16,23 and because tooth loss at older ages
occurs predominantly due to periodontitis,1 the present
findings are consistent with the hypothesis that dental
inflammatory processes and resulting periodontitis may be
relevant to atherosclerotic CVD risk in older adults. Additional
prospective studies with objective periodontal measures and
randomized CVD prevention trials that intervene on existing
periodontitis are needed to confirm this hypothesis.
Positive associations with risks of CVD and mortality have
been more consistently reported in studies that defined
periodontitis
based
on
clinical
examination6–9,24–26
as
compared to self-report.11–13,22,27 Because in the present
study periodontitis was assessed by self-report, comparison
with studies using similar methodology seems most relevant.
No association between self-reported periodontitis diagnosis
and CVD risks has been reported among middle-aged and
older men in the Health Professionals22 and Physician’s
Health11 studies. Periodontitis prevalence was lower (12–
15%) than in the present study (26%), whereas higher
prevalence was seen for current smoking and diabetes
mellitus, each of which are strongly associated with peri-
odontitis and CVD. Nevertheless, age- and smoking-adjusted
relative risks for total CVD or CHD were similar in the studies
on men (relative risk [RR] 1.04–1.12) and the present study
(HR 1.02). In the Women’s Health Study,13 follow-up on
predominantly white women ages 45 and older with similar
diabetes mellitus history but higher current smoking than in
the present study showed significantly increased relative risks
of total CVD and myocardial infarction associated with self-
reported periodontitis following age adjustment (RR 1.27 and
1.34); risks that remained significantly elevated following
multivariable adjustment (RR 1.04 and 1.27). In this study,
however, the periodontitis exposure variable was defined as
combined history of clinical diagnosis or tooth loss. Thus, it is
not possible to fully compare findings with our study in
which periodontitis was defined solely on history of clinical
diagnosis.
Our finding of no association between periodontitis and
incident stroke is similar to results of the Physician’s Health
Study,11 but unlike the significant 33% greater age- and
smoking-adjusted risk in the Health Professionals Follow-up
Study27 and the 28% greater age-adjusted risk in the Women’s
Health Study.13 Both of these studies evaluated nonfatal
stroke only, whereas in the present study combined nonfatal
and fatal ischemic stroke was the end point.
As in previous studies,12,13,27 we found that poorer self-
assessed dentition status was associated with higher risks of
total CVD and CHD. We observed significantly elevated age-
and smoking-adjusted relative risks of comparable magnitude

was 0 to 10 teeth present (RR 1.49–2.13). Whereas stroke
risk was elevated in the Health Professionals study, we did not
observe greater risk among edentulous women following
adjustment for age and smoking. The small number of stroke
cases among edentulous women likely limited our study.

Periodontitis and CVD in Women
LaMonte et al
ORIGINAL RESEARCH

 Total mortality arguably is the best measure of the impact
a risk factor or disease has on population health.28 Previous
studies evaluating total mortality typically have used oral
examinations to define periodontitis.6–9,26 Higher mortality
risk generally has been associated with presence and severity
of periodontitis and with tooth loss, and tends to persist
following adjustment for age, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and
other factors. In the present study on older women, significant
increases in total mortality were seen for both history of
periodontitis and edentulism. Mortality risks remained ele-
vated and of comparable magnitude within strata of selected
cohort subgroups including categories of smoking pack-years
and diabetes mellitus status. Our multivariable adjusted
hazard ratio of 1.17 among edentulous women is comparable
to that (RR 1.21) recently reported in women 80 years old
who self-reported edentulism.10 Taken together, available
findings including the present study suggest that factors
related to periodontitis and retaining natural teeth may have
important implications for survival.
Frequency of dental visits did not modify associations of
periodontitis with total- and CVD mortality, easing concern
about potential diagnostic ascertainment bias. Conversely,
significantly stronger associations for edentulism with both
mortality end points were observed in women with more
frequent compared to less frequent dental visits. The reason
for this interaction is not completely clear. It is possible that
edentulous women also had historically more aggressive
periodontitis requiring greater utilization of dental services.
We do not have measures of periodontitis severity to directly
test this hypothesis, nor do we have information on reason for
dental visits, which also could have provided context for this
result. Although previous studies have demonstrated an
inverse association between frequency of past year dental
visits and total mortality in older women,10 the joint effect of
dental visits with either periodontitis or edentulism was not
reported; thus, comparison with, and context for, our present
findings is not possible.
Numerous biologic mechanisms support plausibility of an
association between periodontitis, edentulism, and risks of
CVD or mortality.4,9,24,29,30 Prominent is systemic endotox-
emia and inflammation resulting from transient bacteremia
induced by subgingival bacterial leaking through ulcerated
epithelium of the periodontal pocket.30 It is reasonable to
expect
that
with
loss
of
all
natural
teeth,
persistent
periodontal infection is unlikely. However, edentulism is more
a reflection of historical dental infection that, when present,
probably contributed both to atherosclerotic disease onset
and progression as well as to breakdown of the periodontium
and subsequent tooth loss. Another possibility is translocation
of bacteria from the oral to systemic compartment that then
initiate localized inflammatory and immune responses at
extraoral sites. This mechanism is thought to be relevant to
atherosclerotic CVD,29,30 particularly in light of oral microbes
being found in atheromatous plaque.31 Factors such as
smoking and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, each an ante-
cedent for periodontitis and atherosclerosis, likely reflect
common pathways shared by these diseases.24,30 Menopau-
sal reduction in endogenous estrogen may be another biologic
pathway shared by periodontitis32 and atherosclerotic CVD.
Lastly, shared genetic susceptibility could predispose individ-
uals to these chronic inflammatory conditions.33
Study strengths include the large cohort of older post-
menopausal women, in whom the association of interest has
been understudied, and the long follow-up and sufficient
number of end point events for primary analysis and
stratification by cohort subgroups. Surveillance for outcomes
was conducted with a standardized approach administered
nationally by the WHI program. The extensive available
baseline information allowed control for several relevant
confounding factors. A major limitation of this study was
reliance on self-reported periodontitis and dentition status.
Although some misclassification would be expected, a
previously conducted validation study in a subgroup of WHI
OS participants showed that older women can validly report
history of periodontitis diagnosis.16 Sensitivity and specificity
determined by cross-classifying self-reported with clinically
assessed periodontitis were reasonably strong for both
younger and older women, and for women of differing levels
of education in our study group (generally 60–80%). These are
comparable to values reported between self-reported and
clinically measured periodontitis in the Health Professionals
Follow-up Study.12,23,27 Based on the sensitivity and speci-
ficity values in our validation study, and as postulated by
Joshipura,27 one might expect misclassification on periodon-
titis history to be around 30% to 40%, which would theoret-
ically attenuate a true relative risk for CVD of 2.0 to about 1.2
to 1.4, comparable to many of the point estimates seen in the
present study. Nevertheless, the possibility of exposure
misclassification should be considered when interpreting
findings reported herein. The somewhat stronger and more
consistent adverse findings associated with edentulism, which
is a more reliable marker of periodontitis history than self-
reported diagnosis, enhances confidence in the present
results. Moreover, if edentulism is, in fact, a surrogate for
past periodontitis, the expectation should be that women
reporting exposure to both factors have the highest disease
risks. Indeed, our sensitivity analysis cross-tabulating total
mortality on jointly classified periodontitis and edentulism
exposures supported this assertion. Because the history of
periodontitis diagnosis was self-reported as a binary response
(yes or no), we were unable to evaluate potential differences
in associations with study outcomes based on disease
severity. Moreover, understanding whether a dose–response
pattern of association exists with periodontitis is of interest,

 but cannot be addressed here. Reliance on a single assess-
ment of periodontitis to predict risks of long-term disease
occurrence also could be seen as a potential study limitation.
However, other studies that have evaluated periodontitis
exposures assessed both at baseline as well as again during
follow-up have reported comparable relative risk measures for
CVD incidence and mortality.12,13,27 Although we included in
multivariable models markers of socioeconomic status, the
possibility for residual confounding by socioeconomic factors
or by healthcare utilization is plausible.
In conclusion, among community-dwelling older post-
menopausal women with no history of CVD, we observed no
association between reported history of periodontitis diagno-
sis and incidence of atherosclerotic CVD events. We did
observe significantly higher risks of CVD incidence and
mortality for edentulous compared to dentate women, risks
that were stronger in women reporting more frequent annual
dental visits. Both self-reported periodontitis and edentulism
were significantly associated with increased total mortality.
The relevance of periodontitis and tooth loss as possible
modifiable risk factors for CVD prevention or prolonged
survival at later ages needs confirmation by other studies.
