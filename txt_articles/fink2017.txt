Background: Optimal treatment to prevent or delay cogni-
tive decline, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or dementia is
uncertain.
Purpose: To summarize current evidence on the efficacy and
harms of pharmacologic interventions to prevent or delay cog-
nitive decline, MCI, or dementia in adults with normal cognition
or MCI.
Data Sources: Several electronic databases from January 2009
to July 2017, bibliographies, and expert recommendations.
Study Selection: English-language trials of at least 6 months'
duration enrolling adults without dementia and comparing phar-
macologic interventions with placebo, usual care, or active con-
trol on cognitive outcomes.
Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently rated risk of
bias and strength of evidence; 1 extracted data, and a second
checked accuracy.
Data Synthesis: Fifty-one unique trials were rated as having low
to moderate risk of bias (including 3 that studied dementia med-
ications, 16 antihypertensives, 4 diabetes medications, 2 non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] or aspirin, 17 hor-
mones, and 7 lipid-lowering agents). In persons with normal
cognition, estrogen and estrogen–progestin increased risk for
dementia or a combined outcome of MCI or dementia (1 trial,
low strength of evidence); high-dose raloxifene decreased risk
for MCI but not for dementia (1 trial, low strength of evidence);
and antihypertensives (4 trials), NSAIDs (1 trial), and statins (1
trial) did not alter dementia risk (low to insufficient strength of
evidence). In persons with MCI, cholinesterase inhibitors did not
reduce dementia risk (1 trial, low strength of evidence). In per-
sons with normal cognition and those with MCI, these pharma-
cologic treatments neither improved nor slowed decline in cog-
nitive test performance (low to insufficient strength of evidence).
Adverse events were inconsistently reported but were increased
for estrogen (stroke), estrogen–progestin (stroke, coronary heart
disease, invasive breast cancer, and pulmonary embolism), and
raloxifene (venous thromboembolism).
Limitation: High attrition, short follow-up, inconsistent cognitive
outcomes, and possible selective reporting and publication.
Conclusion: Evidence does not support use of the studied
pharmacologic treatments for cognitive protection in persons
with normal cognition or MCI.

D
ementia is a clinical syndrome in which an ac-
quired cognitive deficit interferes with a person'
s
independence in daily activities (1). It adversely affects
patient quality of life, burdens caregivers, increases in-
stitutionalization, and is costly to families and society
(2). Alzheimer disease is the most common cause of
dementia, although differentiation between when Alz-
heimer disease is present in isolation and when it is
combined with another cause of dementia may not be
possible in clinical settings. Mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) is an acquired cognitive deficit in the absence of
functional impairment (3, 4) and often leads to demen-
tia (5).
Analyses have suggested that behavioral and phar-
macologic interventions targeting potentially modifi-
able risk factors could substantially reduce Alzheimer
disease prevalence (6). We did a systematic review
of clinical trials to assess the most current evidence
about the efficacy and safety of pharmacologic inter-
ventions for preventing or delaying cognitive decline,
MCI, and dementia and whether effects differ by pa-
tient characteristics.
METHODS
We developed and followed a standard protocol
(7). The full technical report (8) contains detailed
findings.
Data Sources
We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, and
the Cochrane Library for studies published between
January 2009 and July 2017 (Part A of the Supplement,
available at Annals.org). We identified earlier studies
from a 2010 Agency for Healthcare Research and Qual-
ity (AHRQ) report on interventions for preventing
Alzheimer disease and cognitive decline (9). We also

 searched reference lists of eligible studies and articles
suggested by experts.
Study Selection
We included English-language randomized and
nonrandomized controlled trials of adults without de-
mentia (that is, with normal cognition or MCI) that com-
pared U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved
prescription medications versus placebo or any control.
Minimum follow-up was 6 months. Primary outcomes
were cognitive diagnoses of MCI or dementia (Alzhei-
mer disease or unspecified type, but excluding other
specific causes, such as dementia attributable solely to
a clinically recognized stroke). Secondary outcomes
were measures of cognitive performance assessed by
validated instruments. Two reviewers independently
examined titles, abstracts, and full articles for eligibility
and resolved discrepancies by consensus.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
For each study, 2 reviewers directly and indepen-
dently rated risk of bias for outcomes of interest and
the study overall as low, medium, or high on the basis
of AHRQ criteria (10, 11). One reviewer extracted the
study design, participant characteristics, pharmaco-
logic interventions, and funding source from all eligible
studies but extracted outcomes and adverse events
only from studies with low or moderate risk of bias. A
second reviewer checked the accuracy of the extracted
data.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
We organized results by intervention type and cat-
egorized study participants by baseline cognitive status
(normal or MCI). We grouped cognitive tests into mem-
ory tests; global cognitive screening tests (such as the
Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]) or multidomain
neuropsychological tests (such as the Alzheimer'
s Dis-
ease Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subscale); and tests
of executive function, attention, and processing speed
(Part B of the Supplement). We analyzed and reported
cognitive test results by direction of effect and statisti-
cal significance because different cognitive tests were
used, tests were analyzed and reported in many ways,
and we were frequently unable to determine effect size
or assess whether between-group differences in scores
were clinically meaningful. Because of heterogeneity in
study designs and outcomes, results were not pooled
in meta-analyses.
When a treatment comparison had at least 2 stud-
ies or 1 large study (≥500 participants), 2 reviewers
graded strength of evidence for each outcome on the
basis of study limitations, directness, consistency, and
precision (12); strength of evidence for single smaller
trials was graded as insufficient. Assessments were con-
firmed by consensus.
Role of the Funding Source
This review was funded by the National Institute on
Aging and AHRQ. These agencies and members of the
National Academies Committee on Preventing Demen-
tia and Cognitive Impairment helped refine the scope
and reviewed the draft AHRQ report. The authors are
solely responsible for the content of the manuscript
and decision to submit it for publication.
RESULTS
We identified 102 eligible studies of pharmaco-
logic treatments; 51 unique trials had low or medium
risk of bias and were included in analyses (Appendix
Figure, available at Annals.org). Of these, 32 received
at least some industry funding. Trials in which baseline
cognitive test results were essentially normal and those
providing no baseline cognitive data were categorized
as enrolling participants with normal baseline cogni-
tion. Most studies that enrolled participants with cogni-
tive impairment (13–20) specified that participants had
MCI defined by the Petersen criteria (13, 17–20). The
Table shows main efficacy results for all interventions.
Details on study and participant characteristics, includ-
ing cognitive test characteristics, age, baseline cogni-
tion, risk-of-bias ratings, funding source, and strength-
of-evidence ratings, are presented by pharmacologic
intervention in Parts C to H of the Supplement.
Dementia Medications
Among 15 eligible references (13, 14, 19, 21–32), 3
unique trials had low to moderate risk of bias (13, 14,
19, 32) (Part C of the Supplement). These trials pro-
vided mostly low-strength evidence that acetylcholines-
terase inhibitors do not reduce risk for dementia or im-
prove cognitive test performance versus placebo in
older adults with MCI; they gave insufficient evidence
about persons with normal cognition.
Most evidence came from 1 trial of 512 adults
(mean age, 73 years) with MCI who were randomly as-
signed to receive donepezil or placebo (13, 19). After 3
years, the treatment groups did not differ in progres-
sion to Alzheimer disease (HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.57 to
1.13]) (low strength of evidence) or in any cognitive test
(insufficient to low strength of evidence). In participants
with at least 1 apolipoprotein E �4 allele, those as-
signed to donepezil progressed to Alzheimer disease
less often than those assigned to placebo, although re-
sults were not statistically significant after correction for
multiple comparisons. Participants who received done-
pezil were more likely to have adverse gastrointestinal
symptoms, sleep disturbances, and arthritis.
Antihypertensive Medications
Antihypertensive Medication Versus Placebo
Among 14 eligible references (33–46), 8 unique tri-
als had low to moderate risk of bias (33–44) (Part D of
the Supplement). These trials enrolled 31 287 partici-
pants (mean age among 7 trials reporting, 70.2 years).
Low-strength evidence in adults with normal cognition
showed that antihypertensive treatment versus placebo
does not reduce risk for dementia, and moderate-
strength evidence showed no difference between
these treatments on global cognitive screening tests.
No trials reported data about persons with MCI.

 Evidence on risk for dementia was based on 4 tri-
als. With antihypertensive treatment, the Syst-Eur (Sys-
tolic Hypertension in Europe) trial reported a halving of
incident dementia of marginal statistical significance
(35, 36), although 3 subsequent and larger trials each
reported no reduced risk for dementia (38, 42, 43).
TRANSCEND
(Telmisartan
Randomised
Assessment
Study in Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor Intol-
erant Subjects with Cardiovascular Disease) reported
no difference between antihypertensive treatment and
placebo in incident cognitive impairment, defined as a
composite of incident dementia, incident cognitive im-
pairment, or MMSE score less than 24 (low strength of
evidence) (33). Four trials reported no difference
between antihypertensive treatment and placebo in
change on global cognitive screening tests (moderate
strength of evidence) (33, 35, 36, 38, 43), whereas
weaker evidence suggested no difference between
treatment groups for other cognitive tests (34, 37–40).
In the only trial that reported subgroup analyses, treat-
ment effects on risk for incident cognitive impairment
and cognitive test performance did not differ as a func-
tion of age or history of hypertension, stroke, or tran-
sient ischemic attack (33). In the 3 studies that reported
adverse effects (38, 41, 43), other than for methyldopa
(41) no consistent differences existed between active
treatment and placebo.
Intensive Versus Standard Antihypertensive
Treatment
One unique trial with moderate risk of bias ran-
domly assigned 1439 adults (mean age, 62.4 years)
with normal cognition, diabetes, and heightened car-
diovascular risk to a systolic blood pressure target of
less than 120 mm Hg or less than 140 mm Hg for 40
months. It reported no data on MCI or dementia out-
comes and no between-group difference in any mea-
sured cognitive test (low strength of evidence) (47). Par-
ticipants aged 70 years or older did better with
intensive than standard treatment on a single evaluated
memory test and 1 of 2 tests of executive function, at-
tention, and processing speed; however, performance
did not differ by sex, baseline cognition, cardiovascular
disease history, or diabetes duration. Adverse events
data were not reported.
Antihypertensive Medication Comparisons
Among 11 eligible references (15, 16, 33, 34, 41,
48–53), 9 unique trials (15, 16, 33, 34, 41, 48–52) had
low to moderate risk of bias. These trials enrolled
28 933 adults with normal cognition (mean age, 66.6
years) and 81 with MCI (baseline MMSE score range, 20
to 28; mean age, 76.1 years) (15, 16). Findings suggest
that antihypertensive regimens do not differ in cogni-
tive test performance (low to insufficient strength of ev-
idence). In adults with normal cognition, ONTARGET
(Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with
Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) (n = 25 620; mean age,
66.4 years; MMSE score range, 24 to 30) reported no
statistically significant difference in risk for incident cog-
nitive impairment (composite of incident dementia, in-
cident cognitive impairment, or MMSE score <24) be-
tween active antihypertensive treatment groups (low
strength of evidence) (33). Trials provided no informa-
tion about relative effects of antihypertensive regimens
on risk for MCI or dementia. The only trial that did sub-
group analyses reported no differential effects of treat-
ment on any cognitive outcomes as a function of age or
history of hypertension, stroke, or transient ischemic at-
tack (33). In the studies that reported adverse events
(41, 48–50), other than for methyldopa (41) no consis-
tent
differences
existed
between
antihypertensive
treatment regimens.
Diabetes Medications
Among 8 eligible references (17, 20, 54–59), 4
unique trials had low to moderate risk of bias (17, 20,
54, 56, 59) (Part E of the Supplement). In adults with
normal cognition, trials provided no evidence about
whether intensive versus standard glucose control re-
duces risk for MCI or dementia and low-strength evi-
dence that intensive diabetes treatment does not im-
prove performance on cognitive tests.
Evidence for adults with normal cognition was
based on the ACCORD-MIND (Action to Control Car-
diovascular Risk in Diabetes–Memory in Diabetes) (54,
56)
and
ORIGIN
(Outcome
Reduction
with
Initial
Glargine Intervention) (59) randomized trials, which col-
lectively assigned 14 662 adults (mean age, 63.2 years)
with diabetes and high risk for cardiovascular events to
intensive versus standard glucose control for 3.3 and
6.2 years, respectively. The ORIGIN trial reported no
difference between treatment groups in incident cog-
nitive impairment (case report of dementia or MMSE
score <24) (low strength of evidence). Both studies
showed no between-treatment difference in change in
any evaluated cognitive test (all low strength of evi-
dence) (Supplement). ORIGIN reported no consistent
difference in cognitive test performance as a function
of age, sex, baseline diabetes severity, depression, or
education. Neither trial reported adverse events, but
the main ACCORD trial reported that participants as-
signed to intensive glucose control had increased risk
for hypoglycemia, weight gain, and death (60).
Data from 2 small 6- to 12-month trials in over-
weight middle-aged and older adults with MCI pro-
vided insufficient evidence about the effect of diabetes
treatment on cognitive performance tests in this popu-
lation (17, 20).
Lipid-Lowering Medications
Among
10
eligible
references
(47,
61–69),
7
unique trials had low to moderate risk of bias (47, 61–
64, 66, 67) (Part F of the Supplement). These trials en-
rolled 23 097 adults with normal cognition (mean age
range, 46.4 to 76.3 years). They provided insufficient-
strength evidence about whether treatment with HMG-
CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) reduces risk for MCI
or dementia and low-strength evidence that statins do
not improve performance on cognitive tests. No trials
provided data about persons with MCI.

 Evidence about risk for dementia with statins ver-
sus placebo was based on a single 5-year randomized
controlled trial (62) that assigned 20 536 persons to re-
ceive 40 mg of simvastatin or placebo daily. The trial
reported no difference between treatment groups, but
very few participants developed dementia. This trial
and a smaller 6-month trial (66) reported no difference
between statin and placebo in single tests of executive
function, attention, and processing speed and global
cognitive screening tests, respectively. However, 2
other small 6-month trials reported less improvement
with statin than placebo in executive function, attention,
and processing speed tests but no between-group dif-
ferences in memory tests (63, 64). One trial reported
that participants assigned to statins had an increased
risk for abdominal pain or cramps (66), whereas 3 trials
reported no differences in adverse events (62–64).
None of these trials reported subgroup data.
A single trial that compared statin plus fenofibrate
versus statin alone in 503 adults with diabetes reported
that cognitive test performance did not differ between
treatment groups (low strength of evidence) (47). The
authors found no consistent differences in results for
any participant characteristic evaluated and reported
no
adverse
events.
Trials
comparing
statin
plus
ezetimibe versus placebo in persons with atrial fibrilla-
tion (67) and statin versus �-tocopherol (61) enrolled
fewer than 50 participants each and provided insuffi-
cient evidence about treatment differences in any cog-
nitive outcome.
Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs
Among 8 eligible references (70–77), 2 unique tri-
als had low to moderate risk of bias (70–74, 77) (Part G
of the Supplement). In older adults with normal cogni-
tion, trials provided low-strength evidence that non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) do not
reduce risk for dementia and mostly low-strength evi-
dence that neither NSAIDs nor aspirin improves cogni-
tive test performance. No trials provided data about
persons with MCI.
Evidence for NSAIDs was based on ADAPT (Alzhei-
mer'
s
Disease
Anti-Inflammatory
Prevention
Trial),
which randomly assigned 2528 older adults (median
age, 74 years) with at least 1 first-degree relative with
Alzheimer disease to receive naproxen, celecoxib, or
placebo. Masked treatment was stopped after a me-
dian of 15 months (78), after which unmasked follow-up
was continued. ADAPT reported no difference between
either NSAID group and placebo in incident dementia
at 8 years (low strength of evidence) or in any evaluated
cognitive tests at 4 years (low to insufficient strength of
evidence) (70–73, 77). Treatment results did not differ
by apolipoprotein E �4 status (77). Risks for 2 post hoc
cardiovascular outcomes were significantly higher with
naproxen than placebo but no different with celecoxib.
Risk for hypertension was significantly higher in both
NSAID groups than the placebo group (79).
Evidence for aspirin was based on a Women'
s
Health Study substudy, in which 6377 participants were
randomly assigned to receive low-dose aspirin or pla-
cebo (mean age at baseline cognitive assessment, 71.8
years) (74). Those assigned aspirin did no better than
those assigned placebo in change over 4 years on ei-
ther global cognitive screening or memory tests (low
strength of evidence). Aspirin was associated with less
cognitive decline than placebo in 2 of 14 subgroups
(current smokers and participants with hyperlipidemia).
Adverse events were not reported.
Hormone Therapy
Estrogen Only
Among 14 eligible references (80–93), 6 unique tri-
als had low to moderate risk of bias (80–92) (Part H of
the Supplement). In women with normal cognition, tri-
als provided low-strength evidence that estrogen in-
creases risk for a combined outcome of MCI or demen-
tia and does not improve performance on cognitive
tests. No trials gave data about women with MCI.
Evidence for the effect of estrogen on clinical diag-
noses was based on WHIMS (Women'
s Health Initiative
Memory Study) data. This trial randomly assigned 2947
women aged 65 years or older to receive estrogen or
placebo for a mean of 5.2 years; those assigned estro-
gen had a significantly higher incidence of a combined
outcome of MCI or dementia, although not of MCI or
dementia as individual outcomes (low strength of evi-
dence). Results did not differ as a function of any de-
mentia risk factors examined at baseline. Brief cognitive
test performance after 2 years was no different be-
tween women assigned estradiol, 0.014 mg/d, and
those assigned placebo (92); however, women receiv-
ing estrogen, 0.625 mg/d, did slightly worse than those
receiving placebo after a mean of 5.4 years (81). Across
all trials, no between-group difference existed in any
evaluated cognitive test (low strength of evidence). Al-
though
stroke

seemed
no
different
between
groups in the WHIMS substudy (88), the main WHI
(Women'
s Health Initiative) trial reported that women
randomly assigned to estrogen had a 1.4-fold in-
creased risk for stroke (94).
Estrogen Plus Progestin
Among 14 eligible references (80, 85–89, 95–102),
5 unique trials had low to moderate risk of bias (80,
85–89, 95–98) (Part H of the Supplement). In women
with normal cognition, trials provided low-strength evi-
dence that estrogen–progestin increases risk for de-
mentia and does not improve cognitive test perfor-
mance. No trials reported data about women with MCI.
Among 4532 women aged 65 years or older who
were randomly assigned to receive estrogen–progestin
or placebo for a mean of 4.1 years, those assigned es-
trogen–progestin had a significantly higher incidence
of dementia but not of MCI or a combined outcome of
MCI or dementia (low strength of evidence) (88, 103).
These results did not differ as a function of any demen-
tia risk factors examined at baseline (88). Across all tri-
als, no between-group difference existed in any global
cognitive screening test or executive function, atten-
tion, or processing speed test (low strength of evi-
dence), but 4 of 16 memory tests favored placebo (low

 strength of evidence). Results for memory tests seemed
similar across subgroups (97). Although stroke risk did
not differ between treatment groups in the WHIMS
study (89), the main WHI trial reported that estrogen–
progestin was associated with approximately 25% to
40% increased risks for stroke, coronary heart disease,
and invasive breast cancer and a 2-fold increased risk
for pulmonary embolism (104).
Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators
Two unique trials with low to moderate risk of bias
randomly assigned older women with osteoporosis to
receive raloxifene (60 mg/d or 120 mg/d in both trials)
or placebo (105–107) (Part H of the Supplement). A
cognitive substudy of the MORE (Multiple Outcomes of
Raloxifene Evaluation) trial (n = 7478; mean age, 66
years) (105, 106) reported that women with normal
cognition assigned raloxifene, 120 mg/d, versus pla-
cebo had a lower risk for MCI but no reduction in Alz-
heimer disease, any dementia, or a combined outcome
of MCI or dementia (low strength of evidence). By com-
parison, risk for these outcomes did not differ between
women assigned raloxifene, 60 mg/d, and those as-
signed placebo (low strength of evidence). Results did
not differ as a function of baseline estradiol level. Both
trials reported no significant differences between treat-
ment groups on executive function, attention, or pro-
cessing speed or memory tests (low strength of evi-
dence). The MORE cognitive substudy did not report
adverse events, but the main MORE trial reported that
raloxifene was associated with a 3-fold increased risk
for venous thromboembolism, as well as increased risks
for hot flashes, influenza syndrome, leg cramps, and
peripheral edema (108). No trials reported data about
women with MCI.
Testosterone
Three trials that randomly assigned older men to
receive testosterone or placebo provided low-strength
evidence that testosterone supplementation for 6 to 12
months does not improve cognitive test performance
versus placebo among men with low testosterone lev-
els at baseline and either age-associated memory im-
pairment or MCI (18, 109) (Part H of the Supplement).
Evidence was insufficient about effects in men with nor-
mal cognition (110). Men assigned testosterone were
more likely to develop erythrocytosis (109).
DISCUSSION
In persons with normal baseline cognition, we
found low-strength evidence that estrogen and estrogen–
progestin increase risk for dementia or a combined
outcome of MCI or dementia; low-strength evidence
that high-dose raloxifene decreases risk for MCI but not
for dementia; low- to insufficient-strength evidence that
antihypertensive treatment, NSAIDs, and statins do not
alter risk for dementia; and no evidence on the effect of
aspirin, diabetes, or dementia medications on incident
MCI or dementia. We also found mostly low-strength
evidence that none of these pharmacologic treatments
affect cognitive test performance in this population.
In persons with cognitive impairment not meeting
dementia criteria (such as those with MCI), we found
low-strength evidence that cholinesterase inhibitors do
not reduce dementia risk, low-strength evidence that
neither cholinesterase inhibitors nor testosterone slows
decline of cognitive test performance, and insufficient
to no evidence about the effect of other pharmacologic
treatments on either risk for dementia or cognitive test
performance.
On the basis of data from only a few studies, the
effects of the evaluated pharmacologic treatments on
cognitive outcomes did not seem to differ as a function
of studied participant characteristics. Adverse effects
were inconsistently reported, but risks for serious
outcomes were significantly increased with estrogen,
estrogen–progestin,
and
raloxifene
compared
with
placebo.
These largely negative findings on cognitive out-
comes are consistent with those reported in prior sys-
tematic reviews (identified in our searches) of random-
ized controlled trials of pharmacologic interventions to
prevent cognitive decline in persons without dementia.
Several systematic reviews and an American Heart As-
sociation scientific statement published between 2013
and 2016 concluded that cholinesterase inhibitors, an-
tihypertensives, statins, and NSAIDs do not reduce risk
for incident dementia (111–114), and we identified no
eligible trials of these agents reporting dementia out-
comes published since that time. Although findings
that estrogen and estrogen–progestin increase risk for
dementia and MCI were already published and re-
viewed in the 2010 AHRQ review (9), more recent trials
included in the current review have strengthened the
evidence that these treatments also do not improve
cognitive test performance. We identified several re-
cent randomized controlled trials of diabetes medica-
tion published after a 2010 systematic review on this
topic (115), including trials of intensive versus standard
diabetes control in patients with normal cognition and
of diabetes medication versus inactive control in pa-
tients with MCI. Findings of these trials increased the
strength of evidence to conclude that these diabetes
treatments do not improve performance on cognitive
tests.
Observational study results mostly showed that di-
abetes, midlife hypertension, and midlife hyperlipid-
emia were associated with increased dementia risk;
that NSAID or statin use was associated with lower de-
mentia risk; and that no association existed between
postmenopausal hormone use and dementia risk (112,
116–121). The contrast between these results and the
trial data results may be attributable to many factors,
including that the risk and protective factors identified
in observational studies are not causal and that results
are confounded by differences in characteristics be-
tween users and nonusers of these medications. Even if
some of these risk factors are causal, the negative trial
results may have occurred in part because trials were
too few or too small and because interventions were

 introduced too late or treatment duration was too short
to produce clinically meaningful differences in cogni-
tive trajectories in persons with mostly normal baseline
cognition. In addition, some of these persons were rel-
atively young and at low risk for MCI or dementia dur-
ing study follow-up. We found no trial data about
whether pharmacologic interventions in midlife affect
development of cognitive decline, MCI, or dementia in
late life. With these limitations, determining whether in-
sufficient or even low-strength evidence for no treat-
ment benefit reflects inadequacy of the pharmacologic
intervention or limitations in the study designs and data
may be impossible. This review was further limited in
that most trials were not designed to assess cognitive
outcomes and represent only a few of the trials of these
interventions, suggesting that published results could
be subject to reporting bias.
Several of the evaluated pharmacologic interven-
tions affect vascular disease and may have a greater
effect on cognitive impairment attributable to vascular
disease. However, to focus on the syndrome of demen-
tia most typically seen in clinical settings, this review
excluded trials that focused on dementia that attrib-
uted solely to a clinically recognized incident stroke.
Still, if vascular risk factors in older adults were substan-
tial contributors to common forms of late-life dementia,
we would have hoped to see some signal of cognitive
benefit in the trials reviewed, particularly because some
trials saw large improvements in blood pressure, cho-
lesterol, and glycemic control and reduced risk for
stroke and other major cardiovascular events. The neg-
ative findings of the pharmacologic trials included in
this review also may be due in part to each intervention
addressing only 1 of many disease pathways that may
contribute to cognitive decline.
Several large, single-intervention, pharmacologic
randomized controlled trials registered at ClinicalTrials
.gov are ongoing in mostly older adults without demen-
tia and may better clarify the effects of statins, NSAIDs,
and aspirin on cognitive outcomes, as well as provide
new insights about the cognitive effects of insulin, so-
lanezumab, and other experimental agents (Part J of
the Supplement, available at Annals.org). Nevertheless,
the optimal pharmacologic trial might need to simulta-
neously address many risk factors, begin in midlife,
continue to late life with low attrition, measure effect on
a clinically meaningful change in cognitive perfor-
mance tests and rigorously adjudicated MCI and de-
mentia outcomes, systematically collect harms data,
and examine effects both overall and in a priori–se-
lected subgroups. However, a trial with all of these
components is not likely to be logistically or financially
feasible. Identification of true surrogate outcomes for
these clinically relevant outcomes may be a more real-
istic target.
