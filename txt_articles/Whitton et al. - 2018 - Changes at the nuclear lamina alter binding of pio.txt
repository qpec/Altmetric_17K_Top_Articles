Summary
Increasing evidence suggests that regulation of heterochromatin at the nuclear
envelope underlies metabolic disease susceptibility and age-dependent metabolic
changes, but the mechanism is unknown. Here, we profile lamina-associated
domains (LADs) using lamin B1 ChIP-Seq in young and old hepatocytes and find
that, although lamin B1 resides at a large fraction of domains at both ages, a third
of lamin B1-associated regions are bound exclusively at each age in vivo. Regions
occupied by lamin B1 solely in young livers are enriched for the forkhead motif,
bound by Foxa pioneer factors. We also show that Foxa2 binds more sites in Zmp-
ste24 mutant mice, a progeroid laminopathy model, similar to increased Foxa2 occu-
pancy in old livers. Aged and Zmpste24-deficient livers share several features,
including nuclear lamina abnormalities, increased Foxa2 binding, de-repression of
PPAR- and LXR-dependent gene expression, and fatty liver. In old livers, additional
Foxa2 binding is correlated to loss of lamin B1 and heterochromatin (H3K9me3
occupancy) at these loci. Our observations suggest that changes at the nuclear lam-
ina are linked to altered Foxa2 binding, enabling opening of chromatin and de-
repression of genes encoding lipid synthesis and storage targets that contribute to
etiology of hepatic steatosis.

INTRODUCTION
Increasing evidence suggests that regulation of heterochromatin at
the nuclear envelope is a common mechanism underlying metabolic
disease susceptibility and age-dependent metabolic changes (Lopez-
Otin, Galluzzi, Freije, Madeo & Kroemer, 2016). A recent report
implicated disorganization of heterochromatin at the lamina as a dri-
ver of human aging (Zhang et al., 2015). Mutations in LMNA, encod-
ing the nuclear structural protein lamin A/C, result in disturbed
nuclear architecture and cause the premature aging syndrome
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria (HGPS). Additionally, LMNA mutations
lead to partial lipodystrophy, a condition associated with insulin-
resistant diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and hepatic steatosis (Shack-
leton et al., 2000). Multiple enzymes modulating covalent modifica-
tions to lysine 9 of histone 3 (H3K9), the mark associated with
heterochromatin in lamina-associated domains (Guelen et al., 2008),
have been linked to fatty liver, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and obesity
(Picard et al., 2002; Sun et al., 2012; Tateishi, Okada, Kallin & Zhang,
2009; Villeneuve et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2013). We have recently

 implicated lamina-associated factors Hdac3 and Srf in age-dependent
dysregulation of lipid metabolism in the liver (Bochkis, Przybylski,
Chen & Regev, 2014). However, the mechanism relating chromatin
disorganization
at
the
nuclear
lamina
to
metabolic
defects
is
unknown.
Foxa2 is a member of the Foxa subfamily of winged-helix/fork-
head box (Fox) transcription factors comprised of three unlinked
genes (Foxa1, Foxa2, and Foxa3) that share a highly conserved DNA-
binding domain (Friedman & Kaestner, 2006). The structure of Foxa
forkhead box has been solved and resembles that of H1 histone
(Clark, Halay, Lai & Burley, 1993). Foxa1 can bind and open com-
pacted chromatin in vitro (Cirillo et al., 2002), while Foxa2 binds
nucleosomal DNA in vivo (Li, Schug, Tuteja, White & Kaestner,
2011) and mediates nucleosomal depletion during differentiation (Li
et al., 2012). Hence, Foxa proteins have been labeled as “pioneer”
factors for their ability to bind highly condensed chromatin first, dis-
placing linker histones, and enable access for subsequent binding of
additional transcription factors (Zaret & Carroll, 2011). We also
found that Foxa2 occupies considerably more regions in aged fatty
liver, binding regions of decreased nucleosome occupancy at PPAR
targets, and cooperating with PPAR receptors in regulation of gene
expression changes that contribute to steatosis (Bochkis et al.,
2014).
As we have suggested a relationship between lamina-associated
factors and age-dependent decline of hepatic lipid metabolism
(Bochkis et al., 2014), we set out to profile LADs using lamin B1
ChIP-Seq to discover different genomic regions located at the
nuclear lamina in young and old hepatocytes in an unbiased manner.
While nuclei in young mice have a round shape, those in old mice
exhibit nuclear lamina abnormalities (Andrew, Brown & Johnson,
1943; Jin et al., 2010). We find that although a large fraction of
regions is bound by lamin B1 at both ages, a third of the domains
are occupied by lamin B1 exclusively at each age. Regions bound by
lamin B1 only in the young are enriched for the forkhead motif,
bound by Foxa pioneer factors. Moreover, we show that binding of
Foxa2 is increased in a progeroid laminopathy model, similar to
increased Foxa2 occupancy in old livers, contributing to etiology of
fatty liver and age-dependent metabolic dysfunction. In old livers,
additional Foxa2 binding is correlated to loss of lamin B1 and hete-
rochromatin (H3K9me3 occupancy) at these loci. Together, our
observations suggest that changes at the nuclear lamina are linked
to altered Foxa2 binding, enabling opening of chromatin and de-
repression of genes encoding lipid synthesis and storage targets that
contribute to development of hepatic steatosis.

Lamin B1 binds distinct domains in young and
old livers
As we have previously connected two lamina-associated factors
Hdac3 and Srf to dysregulation of lipid metabolism in aged liver
(Bochkis et al., 2014), we decided to continue our investigation into
the role of the nuclear lamina in metabolic dysfunction by profiling
LADs in young and old livers using lamin B1 ChIP-Seq (chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing, data merged from two
replicates in each condition). Consistent with previous reports, nuclei
in old livers are distorted and of irregular shape (Figure 1a, bottom
panel), and aged hepatocytes accumulate lipids (Figure 1b, bottom
panel, lipid droplets indicated by arrows). Lamina-associated domains
lack active histone marks and contain repressive H3K9me2 and
H3K9me3 modifications (Guelen et al., 2008; Sadaie et al., 2013).
Lamina-associated domains present in both young and old livers,
enriched for chromatin marks H3K9me2 and H3K9me3, are shown
in Figure 1c. We computed pairwise correlations for the replicates
(Pearson R) that showed that replicates were similar (lamin B1 –
0.78 for young, 0.66 for old; H3K9me3 – 0.78 for young, for 0.79
old; H3K9me2 – 0.65 for young, for 0.64 old). Epic peak caller, a
more efficient implementation of SICER domain-calling algorithm
(Xu, Grullon, Ge & Peng, 2014), was used to ascertain lamin B1
occupancy. We found a similar number of lamin B1 domains in
young and old hepatocytes (regions called by Epic, Figure 1d, 1,624
in young and 1,519 in old) in vivo. Although a large fraction of
regions is bound by lamin B1 at both ages, a third of lamin B1-asso-
ciated regions are bound exclusively at each age. Binding sites were
mapped to nearby genes using GREAT (McLean et al., 2010). Major-
ity of regions were located distally, 5 to 500 kb from the transcrip-
tion start site (TSS) in both conditions (Figure 1e). A list of genes
embedded within LADs at each age is provided in Table S1. We
compared our results (LADs in young livers) with previously defined
LADs in mice (Peric-Hupkes et al., 2010). The overlap ranged from
42% with mESC data to 47% with MEF LADs. The overlap is reason-
able considering reported genomewide correlation of 0.6 between
mESC and other cell types (Peric-Hupkes et al., 2010) and differ-
ences between DamID and ChIP-Seq methods.
Next, we focused on genes in regions that were differentially
bound by lamin B1 in either young or old livers (examples shown in
Figure 2a.). We performed functional analysis of genes bound by
lamin B1 only in young livers using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).
Pathways
including
“genes
regulated
by
PPARa”
(p-value
1.1 9 10�2), PPARa/RXRa activation (p-value 1.1 9 10�2), and TR/
RXR activation (p-value 2.3 9 10�5) were enriched among these tar-
gets. This observation is consistent with our previous report that
Foxa2 binds regions of reduced nucleosome occupancy at PPARa
targets in aged liver, leading to their activation (Bochkis et al., 2014).
“liver proliferation” (p-value 4.1 9 10�3), known to be impaired in
aged liver (Timchenko, 2009), and “xenobiotic metabolism signaling”
(p-value 7.4 9 10�3) were pathways enriched in lamin B1-associated
regions in old livers. The full set of pathways for regions bound by
lamin B1 is provided in Table S2.
To eliminate the possibility that changes in lamin B1 binding
were due to differences in expression levels, we performed gene
expression and protein analysis of lamina-associated proteins. While
mRNA levels of Lmna, gene that codes for lamin A and lamin C pro-
teins, are downregulated about twofold (t test p-value <.01), expres-
sion of Lmnb1, gene that codes for lamin B1 protein, is not changed

 in old livers (Figure 2b). Although protein levels of lamin B1 also did
not change, confirming that changes in lamin B1 binding were inde-
pendent of lamin B1 expression, protein levels of lamin A declined in
aged livers (about threefold, t test p-value <.005 expression of both
lamin A and lamin B1 is normalized to loading control TBP, Figure 2c)
To identify potential regulators with differential occupancy in
lamin B1 regions in young and old livers, we completed de novo
motif analysis using HOMER (Heinz et al., 2010). LADs are A/T-rich
(Meuleman et al., 2013); hence, using a common genomic back-
ground (without a sequence bias) for both conditions to find motifs
in lamin B1-associated regions would not be appropriate. Thus, we
compared sequences in lamin B1 domains against each other (young
vs. old and old vs, young) to find motifs that were enriched in each
condition. Multiple motifs resembling the forkhead (Fox) consensus
(p-values ranging from 1 9 10�35 to 1 9 10�21) were overrepre-
sented in sites bound by lamin B1 in young livers (Figure 2d, left

 panel). In addition, motifs for Sox (p-value 1 9 10�27) and GATA fac-
tors (p-value 1 9 10�25) were enriched in these regions. Forkhead
and GATA factors are established pioneer factors (Zaret & Carroll,
2011), which actively open chromatin by binding nucleosomal DNA
first and enable subsequent binding of other factors, while Sox fac-
tors may also exhibit pioneering ability (Sarkar & Hochedlinger,
2013). The motifs for these regulators are found in regions bound
by lamin B1 exclusively in young hepatocytes and possibly occupied
by these pioneer factors in the old hepatocytes. In contrast, CG-rich
motifs for Klf factors (p-value 1 9 10�43), Sp1 (p-value 1 9 10�26),
and Zeb1 (p-value 1 9 10�35) motifs were highly enriched in lamin
B1 regions bound in old livers (Figure 2d right panel). The motifs
enriched in lamin B1 sites that are shared between young and old
livers resemble young sites in their sequence profile. We have identi-
fied similar motifs by HOMER (forkhead motif p-value 1 9 10�6,
Sox p-value 1 9 10�7, GATA p-value 1 9 10�3), although enrich-
ment is less significant than for regions bound by lamin B1 exclu-
sively in young livers.

Foxa2 occupies more sites in Zmpste24
mutant livers
Winged-helix transcription factor Foxa2 plays an important role in
lipid homeostasis in aged liver, binding regions of decreased nucleo-
some occupancy near PPAR-dependent lipid synthesis and storage
genes and contributing to gene expression changes that lead to
steatosis (Bochkis et al., 2014). We have shown that Foxa2 occupies
twice as many sites in older hepatocytes (6605 sites in young,
12,834 sites in old)(Bochkis et al., 2014), where lamin A expression
is decreased (Figure 2b,c). In addition, forkhead motif is enriched in

 regions bound by lamin B1 only in young livers (Figure 2d). Hence,
we hypothesized that increased Foxa2 binding in older livers is due
to nuclear lamina defects accompanying aging and examined Foxa2
binding in a laminopathy mouse model. Zmpste24 is a metallopro-
tease that processes prelamin A to a mature form. Zmpste24
mutants, similar to old mice, exhibit nuclear lamina abnormalities and
develop fatty liver (Varela et al., 2005). We found that Foxa2 binding
is increased in Zmste24-deficient mice (8,177) compared to their
wild-type control littermates (4,960) (data merged from three repli-
cates in each condition, peaks called by PeakSeq (Rozowsky et al.,
2009), Figure 3a). We computed pairwise correlations for the repli-
cates (Pearson R) that showed that replicates were similar (0.89,
0.85, 0.86 for WT, 0.74, 0.75, 0.81 for Zmpste24 KO). Comparing
Foxa2 ChIP coverage in young wild-type controls (Figure 3b, left
panel) and Zmpste24 mutants (Figure 3b, middle panel) of sites
bound by Foxa2 in aged livers (Figure 3b, right panel), we found that
more of these sites were bound in young Zmpste24 mutants. Quanti-

between sites bound by Foxa2 in Zmpste24 mutants and old livers

dian regulation in old mice and Zmpste24 mutants (Hood & Amir,
2017). Regions where Foxa2 binding in Zmpste24-deficient livers
resembles Foxa2 occupancy in old livers (Bochkis et al., 2014) are
shown in Figure 3c. To eliminate the possibility that differences in
Foxa2 binding were due to changes in expression levels, we mea-

 littermates, and found that Foxa2 levels do not change (Figure 3d).
Also, lamin B1 protein expression did not change in Zmpste24
mutant livers (Figure 3d).
Motif analysis in Foxa2 sites bound exclusively in Zmpste24-defi-
cient mice (positional weight matrix (PWM) scan using PscanChiP
(Zambelli, Pesole & Pavesi, 2013)) identified consensus sequences
for forkhead (p-value 5.9 9 10�110), Sox (p-value 7.6 9 10�100), and
GATA factors (p-value 4.0 9 10�67), as well as DR-1 element bound
by PPAR nuclear receptors (p-value 1.6 9 10�10, Figure 3e). The
motifs for pioneer factors found in regions occupied by Foxa2 in
Zmpste24 mutants correspond to those detected in sites bound by
lamin B1 and tethered to the nuclear lamina in young livers. We per-
formed functional analysis of genes associated with Foxa2 binding
sites in Zmpste24-deficient mice using IPA. Analogous pathways are
affected by Foxa2 binding in Zmpste24-deficient livers as in older
hepatocytes (Bochkis et al., 2014) (Figure 3f), including activation of
genes regulated by PPARa and LXR, factors that contribute to
steatosis in older livers. Functional categories are associated with
activation of additional nuclear receptors (FXR and PXR, Figure 3f),
which is consistent with our previous findings that ligand-dependent
activation of nuclear receptors requires Foxa2 (Bochkis et al., 2009).

Direct Foxa2 targets are upregulated in
Zmpste24 mutants and contribute to fatty liver
phenotype
To investigate whether Foxa2 binding is functional and influences gene
expression, we focused on direct targets of Foxa2 in Zmpste24-deficient
mice, defined as bound and upregulated as Foxa2 is a transcriptional acti-
vator (Lai et al., 1990). Binding sites were mapped to 2,293 nearby genes
using GREAT (McLean et al., 2010) and compared to gene expression
profile of Zmpste24 mutants (Osorio et al., 2010). We identified 814
direct targets (fold change >2), while expression of 118 genes near a Fox-
a2 site decreased (fold change <�2). Just like in comparison with all Fox-
a2-binding sites (Figure 3f) in Zmpste24-deficient livers, similar pathways
were overrepresented in Foxa2 direct targets and differentially expressed
genes in older hepatocytes (Bochkis et al., 2014) (Figure 4a), including
activation of PPARa and LXR. Hepatotoxicity functions in Foxa2 direct
targets identified by IPA included highly enriched “liver hyperplasia”
(p-value 1.75 9 10�16) and “liver steatosis” (p-value 1.80 9 10�6)
(Figure 4b). The full set of pathways for Foxa2-bound regions and direct
targets of Foxa2 is provided in Table S2. The direct targets included
PPARc, a nuclear receptor involved in development of fatty liver
(Figure 4c) (Gavrilova et al., 2003). Hence, additional Foxa2 binding in
Zmpste24 mutants, like in old liver, leads to activation of gene expression
that contributes to hepatic steatosis.

Foxa2 binding is correlated to loss of lamin
B1 and H3K9me3 occupancy in old livers
To investigate whether changes in occupancy by pioneer factor Fox-
a2 could have functional changes in old livers, we compared
increased Foxa2 binding to changes in lamin B1 occupancy in old
livers. We computed the overlap of all lamin B1 domains in young
livers with Foxa2-binding sites in old liver and found 4,434 such
sites occupied by Foxa2. The correlation is significant (2,967 sites
are found in a background set of random genomic regions of same
size, Fisher’s exact test p-value <.0001). An average profile of lamin
B1 occupancy in young and old livers for these 4,434 sites is shown
in Figure 5a. Lamin B1 is substantially reduced at these sites. In
addition, sum of lamin B1 coverage in 10 kb region surrounding the
Foxa2 site is higher in young livers for 95% of the sites. These
results suggest that even in large domains that are called bound by
lamin B1 in both young and old livers, additional Foxa2 binding in
old mice is accompanied by loss of lamin B1 occupancy locally.
Next, we mapped 4,434 Foxa2-binding sites to closest genes
using GREAT Chip-Seq analysis tool (McLean et al., 2010) and com-
puted an overlap with RNA-Seq data set of differentially regulated
genes in old livers from our previous study (Bochkis et al., 2014).
Three hundred seventy-five such genes were analyzed for enrich-
ment using EnrichR, a collection of distinct gene set libraries (Kule-
shov et al., 2016) (Figure S2). CheA library compared existing ChIP-
Seq data sets with our list of genes and identified binding sites for
PPAR, LXR, and their heterodimer partner RXR significantly enriched
in our gene set. Positional weight matrix analysis found the forkhead
consensus, as well motifs for nuclear receptors. NCI-Nature path-
ways implicated the Foxa2 transcription network. And WikiPathways
database associated our gene list with adipogenesis targets. Collec-
tively, enrichment analyses of Foxa2 targets bound in old livers in
regions of lamin B1 loss corroborate our model. The overlap
between these targets and genes differentially expressed in Zmp-
ste24 mutants is provided in Table S3.
Furthermore, we related the changes in heterochromatin mark
H3K9me3 (5,276 regions in young, 4,579 regions in old livers with
overlap of 2,588, Figure 5b) to Foxa2 binding. For sites bound by
Foxa2 in old livers, we plotted H3K9me3 coverage in young and old
livers in 5 kb regions surrounding the site. We found a reduction in
H3K9me3 levels, showing a correlation between reduced H3K9me3
signal and increased Foxa2 binding (Figure 5c). We show examples
of genomic regions where Foxa2 binding corresponds to decrease in
both lamin B1 binding and H3K9me3 occupancy in old hepatocytes,
suggesting that these regions are no longer tethered to the lamina
and closed and could be open to transcription (Figure 5d). In addi-
tion, Foxa2 binding in Zmpste24 mutants resembles Foxa2 occu-
pancy in old livers in these regions.
In summary, we found that lamin B1 binds distinct domains in
young and old livers. Sequences in sites bound by lamin B1 in young
livers are enriched for the forkhead motif. We observed that protein
levels of lamin A decrease during chronological aging in hepatocytes
where binding of pioneer factor Foxa2 is increased. We found that
Foxa2 occupancy is also increased in Zmpste24 mutant mice, a
laminopathy model, connecting our findings to Foxa2 binding in old
livers. Aged and Zmpste24-deficient livers share several features,
including nuclear lamina abnormalities, increased Foxa2 binding, de-
repression of PPAR- and LXR-dependent gene expression, and fatty
liver. In old livers, additional Foxa2 binding is correlated to loss of

 lamin B1 and heterochromatin (H3K9me3 occupancy) at these loci.
Our observations suggest that changes at the nuclear lamina are
linked to altered Foxa2 binding, enabling opening of chromatin and
de-repression of genes encoding lipid synthesis and storage targets
that contribute to etiology of hepatic steatosis (Figure 6).

DISCUSSION
Here, we used an unbiased approach to investigate changes in LADs
in aging and are providing these data sets as a resource to the field.
While this work is the first to connect regulation of chromatin at the
nuclear lamina to binding of pioneer factors in mammalian aging and
age-dependent metabolic dysfunction, Mango and colleagues have
reported that binding of pha-4, an ortholog of Foxa proteins in
Caenorhabditis elegans, is restricted by emerin, a nuclear lamina com-
ponent, in the pharynx during foregut development. On this basis,
they concluded that nuclear lamina interferes with binding of pha-4,
preventing global decompaction and reorganization of chromatin
(Fakhouri, Stevenson, Chisholm & Mango, 2010). Collectively, these
observations indicate that the relationship between lamina compo-
nents and pioneer factors is conserved and warrants further investi-
gation.
Both LAD sequences and forkhead motifs are A/T-rich, suggest-
ing a model where the nuclear lamina and pioneer factors could vie
for genomic regions such as nucleosomes and transcription factors
compete for DNA binding (Workman & Kingston, 1992). In this para-
digm, pioneer factors would be prevented from binding when these
loci are sequestered to the nuclear envelope but could access these
sites once the chromatin is no longer tethered to the lamina.

 While we find that A/T-rich motifs, including the forkhead con-
sensus, are significantly enriched in sites bound by lamin B1 exclu-
sively in young livers and those shared between young and old livers,
CG-rich motifs are more prevalent in lamin B1 regions bound in old
livers. Increased CG content is associated with DNA methylation.
Analysis of DNA methylation in aged blood cells has demonstrated
presence of age-associated hypomethylated domains, which exhibit
preferential hypomethylation in cancer independently of tissue of ori-
gin (Yuan et al., 2015). Another study has linked hypomethylated
domains in cancer to LADs (Berman et al., 2012). Hence, the pres-
ence of CG-rich motifs in LADs in old livers could indicate an age-
dependent dysregulation of DNA methylation in the liver.
We observe striking similarities between old and Zmpste24
mutant livers, including nuclear abnormalities, changes in lamin A
expression, and increased Foxa2 binding leading to de-repression of
PPAR- and LXR-dependent gene expression that contributes to
development of fatty liver. Hepatic steatosis is a common phenotype
for aged mice (Jin et al., 2010; Ogrodnik et al., 2017), Zmpste24
mutants (Marino et al., 2008; Pendas et al., 2002), and liver-specific
Lmna knockouts (Kwan et al., 2017). In addition, mutations in LMNA
and ZMPSTE24 in patients lead to metabolic dysfunction, including
type 2 diabetes and hepatic steatosis (Galant et al., 2016; Shackleton
et al., 2000). Moreover, a recent report has implicated disorganiza-
tion of heterochromatin at the lamina as a driver of human aging
(Zhang et al., 2015). Numerous enzymes associated with H3K9me3,

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
4.1
|
Mice
Male mice (C57BL6) were purchased from the National Institute of
Aging (NIA) aged rodent colony (Charles River Laboratories). Two
biological replicates of young and old mice were used for chromatin
immunoprecipitation and sequencing. The derivation of Zmpste24
null
mice has
been
described
previously
(Varela et al.,
2005).
12-week-old
wild-type
control
littermates
and
Zmpste24
male
mutants (three biological replicates each) were used for ChIP-Seq
experiments. All animal work was approved by MIT’s Committee on
Animal Care.

Immunofluorescence and
immunohistochemistry
Indirect immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry were per-
formed as described previously (Zhang, Rubins, Ahima, Greenbaum &
Kaestner, 2005). Slides subject to immunohistochemistry were coun-
terstained with hematoxylin and eosin. Hoechst 33528 nucleic acid
stain (ThermoFisher, 1:2,000) was used to detect nuclei.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation and ChIP-Seq
Snap-frozen mouse liver (100 mg) from wild-type mice was used
to prepare chromatin. ChIP and ChIP-Seq were performed as
reported previously (Bochkis et al., 2014). Briefly, liver tissue was
minced in cold PBS and cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde/PBS for
15 min with constant rotation in Labquake tube rotator. Cross-
linking was quenched by adding glycine to a final concentration of
0.125 M. Nuclear lysate was sonicated using Diagenode Bioruptor
for 20 min (30 s on/30 s off). Libraries were made according to
standard Illumina protocol (end repair of ChIP DNA, addition of
A base to the 30-ends, adapter ligation, and amplification). We
used multiplex adapters for sequencing and Kapa HiFi DNA poly-
merase (Kapa Biosystems) for PCR amplification (16 cycles). Library

RNA and protein analysis
Liver RNA was isolated from young and old wild-type mice, and
quantitative reverse transcription–PCR was performed as described
(Zhang et al., 2005). Protein extracts preparation and protein immu-
noblot analysis were performed as reported previously (Bochkis
et al., 2008). The primary antibodies used were rabbit antibody to
FOXA2 (Seven Hills Bioreagents, WRAB-1,200, 1:5,000), rabbit anti-
body to histone H3 (Cell Signaling #4,499), goat antibody to LAMIN

ChIP-Seq analysis
Reads were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10; NCBI Build 38,
Table S4) using BWA v0.7.12 (Li & Durbin, 2009). Duplicate reads
were removed using Picard v 1.134 (http://picard.sourceforge.net).
Reads (phred score ≥20) that aligned uniquely were used for subse-
quent analysis. Data from two biological replicates were merged for
lamin B1 ChIP-Seq comparison (two young and two old). Data from
three biological replicates were merged for Foxa2 binding in Zmp-
ste24 mutants (three WT and three KO). Epic peak caller (https://
github.com/daler/epic), a more efficient implementation of SICER
domain-calling algorithm (Xu et al., 2014), was used to determine
lamin B1-associated domains (mm10 as species, window size of
10 kb, gap size of 3). PeakSeq (Rozowsky et al., 2009) was used to
identify
Foxa2
bound
peaks
against
input
controls
(FDR
5%,
q-value = 0.12). Pairwise correlations among samples for regions at
least 50 bp long were computed in R. We used input reads from the
previous study (Bochkis et al., 2014), a mixture of input chromatin
from young and old wild-type livers (42.9 million total reads).
For Foxa2 ChIP-Seq, as there were more reads in Zmpste24
mutants (21 million in WT, 31 million in KO, Table S4), KO reads
were downsampled to 21 million. We used PeakSeq (21 million WT
reads vs. input controls and 21 downsampled KO reads vs. input
controls) to identify Foxa2 bound peaks. Epic/SICER performs nor-
malization of data using a technique based on filtering with islands,
as described in Zang et al. (2009), thus precluding the need for
downsampling of lamin B1 ChIP-Seq data (89 million reads in Young,
59 million reads in Old, Table S4).

Functional analysis
ChIP-Seq peaks were associated with closest genes with the GREAT
analysis (parameters: single closest gene, 10,000 kb) (McLean et al.,
2010). Overlap between different categories of binding sites was
computed using Galaxy genome analysis tools (Hillman-Jackson, Cle-
ments, Blankenberg, Taylor & Nekrutenko, 2012). Sequencing reads
were visualized with the Integrative Genome Viewer (IGV)(Robinson
et al., 2011). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and PWM scan analy-
sis were performed as reported previously (Bochkis et al., 2014).
Reads were extended to the size of the library insert (150 bp for
Foxa2) to obtain sequences for motif analysis. De novo motif analy-
sis was completed using HOMER (findMotifsGenome.pl command,
young vs. old (as background), old vs. young (as background)). For
overlap analysis (Figure S1), for sites bound by Foxa2 in old livers,
we computed coverage (using bedcov function in samtools) in align-
ment files for young (WT) and Zmpste24 mutant livers. We used a
cutoff
of
400
bases
per
region
(or
read
base
count/read
length = read count, 400/75 = 5.3 reads per region). Heatmaps were
constructed using ngs.plot software (Shen, Shao, Liu & Nestler,
2014).
