Abstract
Background: One approach to prevent adverse drug events is to discontinue (“deprescribe”) medications that are
outdated, not indicated, or of limited benefit relative to risk for a particular patient. However, there is little guidance
to clinicians about how to integrate the process of deprescribing into the workflow of clinical practice. We sought
to determine clinical prescribers’ preferences for interventions that would improve their ability to appropriately and
proactively discontinue medications.
Methods: We conducted a national web-based survey of 2475 prescribers [physicians, nurse practitioners (NP),
physician assistants (PA), and clinical pharmacy specialists] practicing in US Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care clinics.
One survey question presented 15 potential changes to medication-related practices and respondents ranked their
top three choices for changes that would “most improve [their] ability to discontinue medications.” We summed
the weighted rankings for each of the 15 response options. Preferences were determined for the whole sample and
within subgroups of respondents defined by demographic and background characteristics, medication-relevant
experience, and beliefs.
Results: Among the 326 respondents who provided rankings, the top choice for a change that would help improve
their ability to discontinue medications was “Requiring all medication prescriptions to have an associated ‘indication for
use.’” This preference was followed by “Assistance with follow-up of patients as they taper or discontinue medications
is performed by another member of the Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT)” and “Increased patient involvement in
prescribing decisions.” This combination of options, albeit in varying rank order, was the most commonly selected, with
250 respondents (77%) who answered the question including at least one of these items in their three highest ranked
choices, regardless of their demographics, experience, or beliefs.
Conclusions: Continued efforts to improve clinicians’ ability to make prescribing decisions, especially around
deprescribing, have many potential benefits, including decreased pharmaceutical and health care costs, fewer adverse
drug events and complications, and improved patient involvement and satisfaction with their care. Future work,
whether as research or quality improvement, should incorporate clinicians’ preferences for interventions, as greater
buy-in from front-line staff leads to better adoption of changes.

 Background
Adverse drug events (ADEs) are associated with increased
healthcare utilization, costs, and morbidity [1, 2]. One ap-
proach to prevent ADEs is to discontinue medications
that are outdated, not indicated, or of limited benefit rela-
tive to risk for a particular patient [3]. This activity, also
known as deprescribing, has been defined as a “systematic
process of identifying and discontinuing drugs in instances
in which existing or potential harms outweigh existing or
potential benefits within the context of an individual
patient’s care goals, current level of functioning, life
expectancy, values, and preferences” [4].
While discontinuing a medication can be considered
“doing less,” it often requires more provider effort than
simply continuing the status quo. Literature supports
the clinical feasibility and safety of medication discon-
tinuation but does not necessarily provide information
about how to identify which medications can be depre-
scribed or how to proceed in typical practice [5]. One
example
is
the
“Good
Palliative-Geriatric
Practice”
framework developed by Garfinkel et al., but this effort
was a feasibility study and the method appears to be
labor intensive, making its routine use difficult [6].
Others have described the success and failures of pre-
scribing interventions but give little direct guidance to
clinicians; [7, 8] one exception has been developed in
New Zealand [9].
Qualitative research exploring prescribers’ understanding
and approach toward discontinuation revealed concerns
about the negative effects of inappropriate medication use
and overall support for the idea of discontinuing unneces-
sary medications [10]. However, clinicians also discussed
the many factors that impede their ability to deprescribe,
including patient complexity, clinical uncertainty, and
shared management with other healthcare providers, all of
which can contribute to “clinical inertia” around medica-
tion discontinuation [10, 11].
The development of clinical interventions that are
integrated into the clinical workflow may facilitate ap-
propriate deprescribing decisions. However, to increase
the likelihood of success of any such intervention, the
interest and support of the end-users (in this case, the
prescribing clinicians) need to be garnered. To that end,
we undertook the present study to survey a national
sample of primary care providers and clinical pharmacy
specialists in the US Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) to determine preferences for interventions that
would improve their ability to discontinue medications.
Methods
Instrument development
We developed the Provider Perceptions of Medication
Discontinuation survey instrument according to ac-
cepted standards of survey design [12]. Full details of
instrument development have been described elsewhere
[13]. Briefly, we generated a pool of 75 items based on a
conceptual model of 10 dimensions related to medica-
tion discontinuation we previously developed using
qualitative methods and augmented with literature find-
ings [10]. These items were evaluated in a modified
Delphi process by a seven-member panel of researchers
and primary care providers (PCP), including experts in
survey development and medication safety, to create a
draft survey. We then conducted cognitive interviews
with physicians, nurse practitioners, and clinical phar-
macy specialists, including in-depth probes to under-
stand how respondents interpret the items and response
options [14]. To assess providers’ general attitudes re-
garding the use of medication, we included the previ-
ously validated Beliefs about Medications Questionnaire
Overuse scale [15]. Providers were also asked to indicate
their current overall comfort level with deciding to dis-
continue a medication on a 0–10 scale ranging from
“not at all comfortable” to “completely comfortable.”
The survey included 56 items related to medication
discontinuation, plus 8 demographic items. One of the
discontinuation-related questions presented respondents
with 15 potential changes to medication-related prac-
tices and asked them to rank their top three choices for
the changes that would “most improve [their] ability to
discontinue medications.” These change options were
developed from qualitative interviews with clinicians,
literature review, and expert opinion. The full list of
options can be seen in Fig. 1. The survey continued with
an optional open-ended invitation to write in other
suggestions for interventions.
Pilot study and psychometric evaluation
Sample
We surveyed VA clinical providers with prescribing
privileges. Our sampling frame was the Primary Care
Management Module, a centralized VA database which
contains clinical information for all PCPs. From this
listing we identified all providers nation-wide with the
title of Physician-Primary Care, Physician-Attending,
Primary Care Provider, Nurse Practitioner (NP), or
Physician Assistant (PA). Using another centralized
database, we identified Clinical Pharmacy Specialists by
selecting “Pharmacy Service Providers” who had Pri-
mary Care clinical encounters. Based on the sample size
required to assess the psychometric properties of the
survey, we randomly selected 2500 providers from a
total of more than 9951 eligible individuals, oversam-
pling NP/PAs and pharmacists to ensure adequate rep-
resentation and to enable comparisons across the three
provider types (MD/DO, NP/PA, PharmD) and stratify-
ing evenly across four geographic regions (East, South,
Midwest, West).

 Survey administration
We sent each provider an email introducing the survey
objectives and containing a link to the survey website. If
an email was undeliverable, we selected a replacement
participant of the same provider type and geographic
stratum. Non-respondents received up to two reminder
emails at one-week intervals. All responses were an-
onymous. The presentation order of the 15 options for
potential changes to medication-related practice was
randomized among respondents to minimize bias toward
the options near the top of the list.
Analysis strategy
We first examined the distributions of respondents’
demographics and beliefs to identify subgroups with suf-
ficiently robust representation. For some variables with
multiple response options we collapsed categories to fa-
cilitate data analysis by creating relatively equal-sized
subgroups. Based on these results, we dichotomized the
following variables for use in subsequent analyses:
gender (male vs. female), race (non-Hispanic white vs.
other), clinical effort (1–7 vs. 8–10 half-day clinic ses-
sions per week), prior non-VA experience (yes vs. no),
beliefs about medication overuse (agree/strongly agree
vs. neutral/disagree/strongly disagree), and perceptions
of patients’ ability to manage their own health (more vs.
less ability). Similarly, we trichotomized the following
variables: age (<50 years vs. 50–59 years vs. ≥60 years),
provider type (MD/DO vs. NP/PA vs. PharmD), self-rated
comfort with discontinuation (≤6 vs. 7–8 vs. ≥9), experi-
ence within VA (≤4 years vs. 5–9 years vs. ≥10 years), fre-
quency of experiencing uncertainty about the indication
for a patient’s medication (never/rarely vs. sometimes vs.
often/usually), experience with discontinuing medications
initiated by other providers (never/rarely vs. sometimes vs.
often/usually), and experience with patient activation (low
vs. medium vs. high).
Because the responses to the main outcome (potential
intervention approaches) were ranked, we assigned a
weight of 3 for any option that was selected as a first
choice, a weight of 2 for any option selected as a second
choice, and a weight of 1 for any option that was se-
lected as a third choice. We then summed the weighted
rankings for each of the fifteen response options. Prefer-
ences were determined for the sample as a whole and by
categories of respondents’ demographics and beliefs as
described above. Write-in responses were reviewed for
suggestions that differed from the options included in
the survey instrument.
All analyses were performed using SAS software,
Version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc). This study protocol was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of the VA
Boston Healthcare System.
Results
A total of 411 clinical providers completed the online
questionnaire. After accounting for unreachable individ-
uals (n = 25), the response rate was 17% (411/2475).
Non-responders were more likely than responders to be
physicians, as compared with NP/PAs or pharmacists,
but were otherwise similar with respect to age, gender,
and geographic region. Details regarding respondent
demographics are in Table 1. Regarding data quality, the
median percent of missing responses per item on the
substantive questions was 11.7 (range 0.01–16%); the
median percent missing on the demographic questions
was 17.2 (range 16–19%).

 With respect to medication discontinuation, clinicians
rated themselves on the higher end of the comfort scale,
with 73% scoring 7 or higher out of 10. A total of 11%
agreed or strongly agreed that medications are overused,
and 27% rarely or never encountered uncertainty about
the indication for a medication. Additional details about
respondents’ beliefs can be seen in Table 2.
Among the 326 respondents who provided rankings,
the top choice for a change that would help improve
their ability to discontinue medications was “Requiring
all
medication
prescriptions
to
have
an
associated
‘indication for use.’” This preference was followed by
“Assistance with follow-up of patients as they taper or
discontinue medications is performed by another mem-
ber of the Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT)” and
“Increased patient involvement in prescribing decisions”
(Table 3). This combination of options, albeit in varying
rank order, was the most commonly selected, regardless
of
prescriber
demographics,
experience,
or
beliefs;
overall, 250 (77%) of respondents who provided rankings
included at least one of these in their top three highest
ranked choices.
There were a few exceptions to this combination of pre-
ferred interventions. “Improved information exchange
with all VA and non-VA pharmacies to confirm medica-
tion
reconciliation”
was
selected
more
often
than
“increased patient involvement” among respondents who
were younger (age ≤ 49 years), had worked in the VA for
≤4 years, had never/rarely encountered indication uncer-
tainty, had low or high self-rated comfort, or had lower
experience with patient activation. “Improved information
exchange” was also chosen by respondents who believed
medications were overused, rather than selecting “assist-
ance with follow-up of patients.” Providers who reported
rarely discontinuing medications by other clinicians or
who were non-white preferred “Use of clinical deci-
sion support tools, such as drug-drug alerts, within
the electronic health record” instead of “assistance
with follow-up.” Finally, clinical pharmacy specialists
ranked having an “indication for use” first, followed
by “improved information exchange,” but then ranked
“Improved information exchange with providers lo-
cated at community facilities” third.
Fifty-one respondents (14%) wrote additional sugges-
tions or comments. The majority were variations on the
15 proposed interventions, expressing support for division

tients. Others requested explicit clinical guidelines and
criteria for deprescribing.
Discussion
We surveyed a national sample of physicians, nurse
practitioners, physician assistants and clinical pharma-
cists in VA to assess their preferences for interventions
to support deprescribing. Including the indication for
use on all prescriptions was the highest ranked choice to
support clinical providers’ efforts to discontinue medica-
tions, suggesting that this intervention may have wide
acceptance among many clinicians across VA. Other
highly rated interventions included increased teamwork
to monitor patients after deprescribing and including
patients in the decision-making process.
Much as clinical uncertainty can impede a physician
from intensifying medication, it can also hinder discon-
tinuation. If a patient is tolerating a medication and the
indication (clinical reason for a medication’s use) is un-
clear, there may be reluctance to stopping it without a
compelling reason. In a study by Straand et al. looking
at patient-physician agreement about the decision and
rationale for discontinuing a medication, up to 30% of
the medicines had an unclear indication [16]. One factor
contributing to this uncertainty could be the frequent
use of off-label prescribing in practice, which one study
found accounts for over 20% of all prescription medica-
tions [17]. Certain medications, such as gabapentin and
amitriptyline (an anticonvulsant and antidepressant, re-
spectively) are used off-label up to 80% of the time [17].
Given that one of the first steps in the deprescribing
process is to review the rationale for use so as to identify
potentially inappropriate medications, not knowing the
indication for a medication is an early obstacle to dis-
continuation [3, 8].
Many patients have medications prescribed by mul-
tiple providers in separate healthcare systems and filled
in different pharmacies [18]. This system-level complex-
ity
also
contributes
to
loss
of
information
about
indication for use [19]. In the Straand study, over half of
the medicines discontinued were prescribed by someone
other than the discontinuing provider [16]. Compound-
ing the impact of such information loss is potential re-
luctance among many clinicians to stop a medicine
initiated by another provider [3, 19]. Knowing the indi-
cation for a prescription may provide reassurance to the
discontinuing provider that deprescribing is appropriate.
Others have proposed similar interventions, such as in-
cluding a “review by” date or “planned duration of use”
that would prompt review of a medication’s continued
appropriateness [4]. Likewise, the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services requires nursing home patients to have
an indication for all medications [3]. One intervention
study prompted inpatient providers to document the indi-
cation for three specific medications if an appropriate one
was not found on the problem list [20]. This study found
including an associated indication at the time of prescrib-
ing increased, albeit these were often for off-label or non-
evidence based use. Evaluation of this type of intervention
in the outpatient setting and determining its effect on
future discontinuation is still needed.
Including the indication with prescriptions has known
and potential benefits in addition to aiding deprescribing
decisions by the clinician. It may allow for therapeutic
substitutions, in that the clinician can evaluate if there
are new treatment options that were unavailable when
the medication was initiated. In situations where pre-
scriptions are handwritten, including a diagnosis allows
a pharmacist to confirm that the medication is the one
intended, especially when the handwriting is poor [21].
It may also help with drug utilization reviews [22]. Re-
lated to the findings in our study, adding an indication
may increase patient knowledge [23]. One of the top
ranked interventions was to increase patient involve-
ment in decision-making; educating patients at the initi-
ation of a medication should facilitate their participation
in subsequent deprescribing discussions. In a review of
12 intervention studies by Ostini et al., including the pa-
tient was a key component of successful deprescribing
[24]. While it is unclear whether the indication should

 be written in medical or layman’s terms, either approach
could potentially educate the patient. Including the indi-
cation on the printed prescription and/or the label of
the medication packaging might allow for more feedback
from the patient about whether the clinical problem still
exists or whether the medication ever alleviated symp-
toms. It has been suggested that conversations about
deprescribing may also lead to increased discussion
about overall goals of care; [25] given the high cost of
medical care at end of life, providing the indication and
consequent deprescribing may have even greater impli-
cations on healthcare utilization.
Another highly preferred intervention was involve-
ment of other members of the Patient Aligned Care
Team, VA’s patient centered medical home. This finding
speaks to the time constraints felt by many PCPs and
their desire for workload support [19]. In a corollary to
the increased monitoring of patients often required
when initiating or increasing the dose of a medication,
discontinuing or decreasing the dose may lead to similar
increased requirements for surveillance, communication
and office visits. Knowing that this follow-up could be
managed by another team member (e.g., a nurse) may
make prescribing clinicians more amenable to enacting
medication changes. Indirectly, redistributing tasks may
free up clinicians to give more time to re-evaluating the
continued need for a medication rather than just renew-
ing a prescription. In one study, the majority of out-
patient prescriptions were renewals (72%) as compared
to initiation of a new medication [26]. It may also create
more time in the clinical visit to have the conversation
with the patient about discontinuing a medication, a
process which might, in fact, be less time consuming if
the patient is more knowledgeable.
These findings are of use to clinical practice managers
in helping to guide future changes to clinical practice.
The consistency of the preferences among the providers
in our study, regardless of provider characteristics,
experience or beliefs, indicates that these intervention
options are more likely to be accepted by a wider range
of providers. Further, including an indication could be
integrated into electronic health records and computer-
ized order entry systems. Other health information tech-
nologies and clinical decision support systems have been
shown to reduce the initiation of inappropriate prescrib-
ing [27, 28]. Requiring the prescriber to select from
approved indications and commonly used off-label rea-
sons, with an option to write in alternate rationale, could
lead to widespread inclusion of indication for use.
Several limitations to our study should be noted. The
survey response rate was low, which could reduce the
ability to generalize to all VA clinicians. Multiple factors
may have contributed to this, including clinicians’ busy
schedules and the ability to only access the survey from
behind the institutional firewall. Clinicians have lower
response rates than the general population, [29, 30] and
there was no incentive provided. However, other than
having a higher proportion of physicians, the non-
responders were similar to the responders with regard to
age, sex and geographic region. Also, the survey was
conducted in VA and may not be generalizable to other
health care settings. Future studies outside VA should
examine prescribers’ preferences for interventions to
support deprescribing.
Conclusions
When asked to indicate their preferences for the changes
in clinical practice that would best support their efforts
to identify and discontinue unnecessary mediations, pri-
mary care providers and clinical pharmacy specialists
most strongly endorsed a requirement that all medica-
tions have an associated indication for use. Other highly
preferred interventions were division of labor among
care team members and including the patient in medical
decision making. Future work, whether as research or
quality improvement, should incorporate these prefer-
ences, as greater buy-in from front line staff leads to
better adoption of changes [31]. While the exact design
and implementation of such interventions is yet to be
determined, continued efforts to improve the ability of
PCPs to make medication decisions, especially around
deprescribing, have many potential benefits, including
decreased pharmaceutical and health care costs, fewer
adverse drug events and complications, and improved
patient involvement and satisfaction with their care.
