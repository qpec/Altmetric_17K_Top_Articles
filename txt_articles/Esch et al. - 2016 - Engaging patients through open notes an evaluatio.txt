ABSTRACT
Objectives: (A) To gain insights into the experiences
of patients invited to view their doctors’ visit notes,
with a focus on those who review multiple notes; (B)
to examine the relationships among fully transparent
electronic medical records and quality of care, the
patient-doctor relationship, patient engagement, self-
care, self-management skills and clinical outcomes.
Design: Mixed methods qualitative study: analyses of
survey data, including content analysis of free-text
answers, and quantitative-descriptive measures
combined with semistructured individual interviews,
patient activation measures, and member checks.
Setting: Greater Boston, USA.
Participants: Patients cared for by primary care
physicians (PCPs) at the Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center who had electronic access to their PCP
visit notes. Among those submitting surveys, 576 free-
text answers were identified and analysed (414 from
female patients, 162 from male patients; 23–88 years).
In addition, 13 patients (9 female, 4 male; 58–
87 years) were interviewed.
Results: Patient experiences indicate improved
understanding (of health information), better
relationships (with doctors), better quality (adherence
and compliance; keeping track) and improved self-care
(patient-centredness, empowerment). Patients want
more doctors to offer access to their notes, and some
wish to contribute to their generation. Those patients
with repeated experience reviewing notes express fewer
concerns and more perceived benefits.
Conclusions: As the use of fully transparent medical
records spreads, it is important to gain a deeper
understanding of possible benefits or harms, and to
characterise target populations that may require varying
modes of delivery. Patient desires for expansion of this
practice extend to specialty care and settings beyond
the physician’s office. Patients are also interested in
becoming involved actively in the generation of their
medical records. The OpenNotes movement may
increase patient activation and engagement in
important ways.
INTRODUCTION
Easy access to personal health information
has long been on the ‘wish lists’ of patients
and their advocates,1–5 and modern health
information technology, the Internet, and
secure
patient
portals
have
dramatically
increased the possibilities for patients.6–9 In
the USA, the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act (HIPAA), enacted in
1996, affords patients the right to access
their
clinical
information
and
medical
records, except in rare circumstances primar-
ily
involving
major
mental
disorders.
However, until recently, it has been difficult
for patients to gain access, and only rarely do
they review the notes their clinicians write
following encounters, both in the ambulatory
setting and on hospital wards. Today, elec-
tronic health records (EHRs), coupled to
patient-facing, secure Internet portals, facili-
tate access if providers decide to offer it, and
such portals are spreading rapidly, partly in
response
to
federal
incentives.10–13
More
than five million patients in the USA are now
registered on portals that offer ready and
secure access electronically to their clini-
cians’ notes.
Many argue that EHRs should support
transparent
clinical
communication
with
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ This study uses rigorous qualitative methodology
and descriptive quantitative measures to under-
stand the experience of patients who both utilise
health services frequently and read their primary
care physician’s visit notes online.
▪ It compares free-text survey responses from
samples of patients who frequently read their
encounter notes to responses from those who
made little use of this option.
▪ It draws on face-to-face interviews with an
information-rich, purposive sample of patients
who had read notes from many visits. The
results suggest that patients who read their
notes are actively engaged in their care and have
a better understanding of their health and care,
but the generalisability of the findings is limited
because patients who were cared for in a single
institution differed from a majority of patients
nationally by virtue of having registered on
secure electronic patient portals.

BMJ Open: first published as 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010034 on 29 January 2016. Downloaded from 
 patients,14–16 but the practice remains controversial.17–24
Doctors worry about disturbances to their workflow and
fear frightening some patients. At a time when elec-
tronic information breaches are widely publicised, some
worry that general concern about loss of privacy may
lead patients to withhold information or refrain from vis-
iting doctors when care may be indicated. On the other
hand, easy access to records may encourage underserved
populations to engage more actively with the healthcare
system.25 26
Secure electronic patient portals offer the opportunity
to improve patient education,27 28 the management of
chronic conditions29 30 and efficiency of care31 by shift-
ing care from a prime focus in the doctor’s office towards
more integrated perspectives that include patients’ daily
lives, homes, caregivers and families.32–35 Transparent
hospital records may promote more information sharing
in clinician–patient communication.36 37 Overall, infor-
mation gaps may be narrowed, thereby facilitating better
continuity and integration of care.38–40 Patients appear to
value the convenience of easy and flexible access,41 and
individuals with poor health status may, in particular,
benefit by being able to share their information with
family members and other informal caregivers.42 43
OpenNotes, a rapidly expanding national movement
in the USA that encourages clinicians to offer patients
ready access to their encounter notes, began as a dem-
onstration and evaluation study in 2010, with 105 volun-
teer primary care physicians (PCPs) and 19 000 of their
patients in Boston, rural Pennsylvania, and the Seattle
inner city.44–47 Notified automatically via a secure email
message when a note was signed, patients were invited to
review their doctors’ notes, and they were again encour-
aged to do so prior to a next scheduled visit. Results
from the 1-year evaluation were striking and attracted
considerable attention from professional groups and
consumers.48 Four of five patients read their note(s);
two-thirds of those surveyed a year after the experiment
started reported potentially important clinical benefits;
99% of the patients completing surveys wanted the prac-
tice to continue, whether or not they chose to read the
notes; and 85% indicated that access would be import-
ant for their future choice of a provider or system.
Perhaps most strikingly, at the end of the study, no
doctor chose to discontinue the practice. Since this
study, the findings have been replicated in several other
settings, including hospitalised patients,49–51 and today
the entire Veterans Administration health system, many
major academic health centres, large health systems and
increasing numbers of smaller institutions in urban and
rural settings in the USA are adopting the practice
(http://www.myopennotes.org). Although percentages
of patients reading their notes may differ, study results
indicate that patients both value and benefit from
online access to clinical notes, and adherence for some
medications may indeed improve.52
Patients can read their notes at home or wherever
they want, that is, asynchronously and repeatedly, and
can readily share their notes with people of their choice
by downloading them and forwarding them, or by invit-
ing others to read them on a computer, tablet or smart-
phone. Some users now have 5 years of experience with
open notes, and many patients have become frequent
users. We decided to revisit this ‘expert’ population and
to gather further insights through a systematic analysis of
free-text comments offered in the patient surveys, and
through in-depth interviews with individuals with a heavy
burden of illness who reviewed their notes frequently.
Objectives of this study
1. To characterise the patient experience with open
notes and, in particular, to identify and describe
themes that emerge from patients making primary
care
visits
and
reading
their
notes
with
high
frequencies;
2. To examine whether and how open encounter notes
are linked to patient engagement;
3. To evaluate from the frequent user’s perspective how
open encounter notes/transparency relates to self-
care/self-management, patient outcomes, quality of
care and the patient–physician relationship.
METHODS
This study used a mixed methods research design
(figure 1). We examined free-text responses and patient
characteristics from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center (BIDMC) survey respondents participating in
2010–2011, with the quantitative findings published in
2012.48 Baseline surveys (n=4545) were collected to
examine the preintervention study population character-
istics
and
expectations
before
exposure
to
open
notes.45 46 Patients were eligible if they had been regis-
tered on the patient Internet portal for at least 1 year
before the start of the study, and if their PCPs agreed to
offer them electronic access to their office notes.
Patients were surveyed online before and after the inter-
vention. To permit comparisons between preinterven-
tion
expectations
and
actual
experiences,
postintervention surveys were based largely on the base-
line surveys. Postintervention data collection occurred
after approximately 1 year of exposure to open notes. At
BIDMC, 10 355 patients finished the intervention with
6678 providing postintervention surveys. With this ori-
ginal data pool of preintervention and postintervention
surveys, we started our evaluation by probing for note
availability/reading frequencies (figure 2). Besides free-
text examination in the original survey data set, we also
interviewed individual BIDMC patients who had read
multiple notes during and after the original study
period. For our study, we applied several qualitative
methodologies and standards: grounded theory forma-
tion/grounded hermeneutic approach, crystallisation/
immersion techniques, content analysis and multiple tri-
angulation measures including member checking on
various levels.53–63

 We began with a prestudy immersion project64 (see
online supplementary appendix 1). We developed a list
of 100 questions to derive key points for exploration.
The immersion project yielded the structure for the
interview guide.
Our study contained two arms, an analysis of the free-
text survey responses (FTA) arm and an evaluation of
the qualitative interviews (QIA) arm (figure 1). Seeking
insights into patients’ expectations and experiences, in
the FTA arm, we examined patients’ free-text responses

BMJ Open: first published as 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010034 on 29 January 2016. Downloaded from 
 both in baseline (expectations) and postintervention
(experiences) surveys collected before and after the ori-
ginal study period (see online supplementary appendix
2). We included responses from patients who had access
to at least six notes from the start of the OpenNotes
intervention
until
1 year
after
its
completion
(24 months). Among patients with ≥6 notes available,
we included comments from both those who had read
at least 7 notes and those who had read 0–2 notes
(figure 2). We iteratively analysed these comments and
created a codebook using inductive methodology and
constant content analysis (‘analytic induction’).65
66
During this process, we kept baseline and postinterven-
tion data separate, as well as data from low and high-
frequency users, and started our analyses with baseline
data, then going through the various data subsets (low
and high-frequency users at pre- and at postintervention,
respectively). Once the codebook was formed and
stable, following various iterative cycles of data examin-
ation (starting with all portions of data subsets, then
examining the entire data at a stretch), we again ana-
lysed and then coded the complete data set, thereby cre-
ating a comprehensive picture of the free-text survey
content. In order to still allow for distinct views and com-
parisons, for example, between low to high users and
pre to post data, we set up a quantitative descriptive ana-
lysis of code counts and frequencies in the various sub-
groups. For this analysis, we used Atlas.ti, V.7.
In the qualitative interview analysis (QIA) arm, we
conducted semistructured, in-depth, face-to-face inter-
views
with
English-speaking
‘heavy
user’
patients,
defined as those who read at least 8 notes in a 24-month
period. We recruited these patients as information-rich
key informants67 by sequential inclusion from a purpos-
ive sample (figure 3). We stopped these interviews when
we reached thematic saturation. The interviews focused
on engagement and self-care, and each patient com-
pleted
the
patient
activation
measure
(PAM-13)
survey.68
69 All interviews were conducted in 2014
(February–March) in Greater Boston and were recorded
and transcribed verbatim using a transcription service.
Additional field notes were taken during the interviews.
The QIA and FTA were followed by a data consolida-
tion/reconciliation phase (figure 1). This cross-arm ana-
lysis combined the two arms as we searched for a richer
understanding of key themes.
TE and BP performed the data analysis and coded
independently, using different styles for each target
population and research objective (eg, immersion/crys-
tallisation, editing and template). We used multiple mea-
sures
of
triangulation
to
ensure
credibility,
dependability, transferability and reflexivity. We asked
three PCPs (2 female, 1 male, age 44–56) with extensive
OpenNotes experience (working with it for >40 months,
independent of the research team) to serve as content
experts (figure 1).
In an attempt to avoid ‘socially desirable’ comments in
favour of the OpenNotes initiative, the interviewer (TE)
stressed his neutrality and independence at the start of
each interview session. In addition, to avoid ‘framing
effects’, he provided no inside information (such as sci-
entific data or recent or unpublished evidence).
All study procedures were approved by the institu-
tional review board (IRB) of the Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center, Boston.
RESULTS
Themes from the survey arm (FTA)
A total of 487 patient surveys met our inclusion criteria
(figure 2), and these were analysed for free-text content.
The number of utilisable free-text answers was 576
(female: 414, male: 162; age: 23–88 years), with a word
range of 2–416; the majority of answers ranging from 50
to 150 words. During our analysis, we identified 1980
codes that then populated the codebook that emerged
in
the
iterative
analytic
process
(see
online
supplementary appendix 3). We made adjustments to

BMJ Open: first published as 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010034 on 29 January 2016. Downloaded from 
 the codebook until we achieved saturation. Inter-rater
reliability was 0.977 after the first round, and 1.0 after
the second round of reconciliation. A third independent
coder, who was prepared to step in in case of unsettled
incongruities, was not mobilised.
Five themes were identified: understanding, relation-
ship, quality, self-care and improvements for the future,
with up to 15 distinct codes in each domain (figure 4).
The most frequently cited codes addressed the use of
clinical notes for refreshing memory, improved under-
standing of one’s own health information, and confirm-
ation of one’s understanding (figure 5). Patients also
frequently reported improved trust in the physician–
patient relationship and better quality through using the
notes as a reference. Adherence and compliance were
also reported as enhanced due to improved clarity of
health information. In the self-care domain, increased
patient-centredness
and a
greater
sense
of
control
(reduced
helplessness)
were
most
frequently
cited.
Finally, regarding future improvements, a wish for more
or all doctors to participate in the OpenNotes move-
ment was predominant.
Quantitative-descriptive
analysis
(table
1,
online
supplementary appendix 4) demonstrated that more
experience with open notes correlated with fewer con-
cerns and more perceived benefits. Compared to those
who had read 0–2 notes, high users (those who had
read at least 7 notes) reported less confusion or fewer
safety and privacy concerns, along with an increase in
trust, motivation and feeling of control. Female patients
differentiated themselves from male patients by more
frequently mentioning better understanding of their
doctor’s work (and higher appreciation of their skills),
together with an increased ability to refresh memories
of visits as a benefit of reading notes. Patients with
mental disorders (defined as 2 visits with a diagnosis of
psychosis, depression, anxiety or substance abuse; or one
visit with a prescription for a psychiatric medication)
wrote more frequently about better communication with
their doctors, better care coordination, and increased
ability to self-manage and self-coordinate (including
decreased feelings of stress/challenge or distraction
during visits) than did patients without mental disorders.
Compared
to
those
in
better
health,
people
who
reported fair/poor health more frequently described
better care coordination as a result of reading notes.
Activation and engagement as general aspects of the
patient experience with open notes were mentioned in
particular by those who had reported fair/poor health
conditions prior to the actual experience (at study base-
line), in addition to those who reported good health at
the end (compared to excellent/very good or fair/poor
at this point). Non-white patients more often reported
better clarity of health information, higher motivation
about
their
health
and
increased
confidence
and
encouragement.
Themes from the interview arm (QIA)
Thirteen
patients
were
interviewed
(table
2).
The
average length of interviews was 40 min. We adminis-
tered the PAM questionnaire at the end of each patient
interview; it took an estimated additional 7 min.
Analysis of the transcripts confirmed the codebook
and its themes (see online supplementary appendix 5).

 Among these high users, few reported safety and privacy
concerns (two of 13 interviewees), and four reported
sharing their notes with others. Some expressed the pos-
sibility of withholding information during visits because
of worries about others gaining undesired access. The
overall patient experience was characterised with terms
of transparency, trust, easy access, efficiency, health ben-
efits, harm avoidance, more involvement and feeling in
control. Patients wanted more interactivity of notes, for
example, the option to comment on notes or give input
to have errors corrected. High users usually read single
notes once or twice. The idea of an ‘embargo’ or delay
in releasing notes was mentioned frequently, either for
protecting patients from reading notes that could be
overwhelming at a given moment, or to make sure that
they would not accidentally read ‘bad news’ online
before seeing their doctor in person.
High-use
patients
appeared
strongly
motivated,
involved, active and engaged in their care. This group
had a positive attitude towards self-care; at least 75% of
the codes from the self-care domain of our codebook
were met (checked) in all 13 interviews, and a third of
them
explicitly
matched
with
100%.
However,
this
finding was not always consistent with the PAM-13 scores
(Table 2). For example, patients could conform to eight
of eight self-care codes but still be placed in lower PAM
ranges. Data analysis revealed that current medical con-
dition (eg, facing chronic disease) and education (eg,
professional academic background) are examples of
factors that may have exerted influence on PAM scores:
agreement with activation measures (as measured by
PAM) did not in every case correspond to individual
engagement reports and self-care approval (eg, interview
analysis suggested higher activation scores for some
participants).
Themes from cross-arm analysis
We
performed
a
structured
examination
‘across-
methods’ to gain a more detailed and robust picture.
Overall experience, individual use and constraints
Frequent users of open notes were strongly in favour of
an open, transparent and candid communication style,
with easy access and high availability for them, but they
still wanted to have personal and individual face-to-face
time with their doctors as the primary means of commu-
nication. Patients wanted their doctors to tell them of
serious or potentially stressful information and expressed
caution towards ‘automated’ openness that might ante-
date contact with the doctor (“I guess my concern
would be reading something at a time where you are
physically not prepared to deal with what actually hap-
pened.”). Patients described also how they felt ‘empow-
ered’ or ‘reassured’ and used open notes in particular
to refresh their memories of particular medical encoun-
ters, or generally as a ‘memory aid’ to track their health
information (“I look at OpenNotes as a reassuring
memory aid.”).
Trust
Enhanced trust—regarded as a key part of an improved
patient–physician relationship—was frequently reported
(“I think it’s important to know that I’m trusted as part
of this relationship. And it helps me trust the doctor as
well.”). This was particularly true for female patients,
patients without mental health problems and older
patients. Self-rating of fair or poor health was also corre-
lated with higher trust.
Clarity, error detection and correction
Better clarity of health information (reading notes
resulted in better clarity) was often mentioned, particu-
larly by patients with mental health problems, older
patients and non-white patients. Clarity included clear—
or
clarification
of—instructions,
possibly
improving
adherence to and compliance with medications. In add-
ition, almost all interviewed patients mentioned the
experience of detecting errors in the notes, mostly non-
medical or minor, and they usually did not contact the

 doctors about errors, at least not before a next visit.
Nearly all interviewed patients reported that reading
notes led them to correct their therapeutic regimen in
some way, with most changes focusing on medication
intake. As examples, patients mentioned correcting
wrong dosages or times of medication intake as a result
of reading their notes. Patients frequently mentioned
the OpenNotes initiative as having health benefits by
possibly helping them avoid harm and improving the
quality of their care. While virtually all patients found
notes containing errors in documentation or medical
instructions, they found them only on occasion (happen-
ing, as patients reported, only once or twice over the
2 years). As examples: “I discovered that the doctor has
misunderstood something I said.”, “It … sometimes
clarifies my need and use of medications.”, “I was
[online] and happened to see that I was taking the
wrong amount of prescription.”, “The biggest benefit I
see is being able to … double check.”
Sharing, coauthoring notes and withholding information
The majority of frequent note users in our analyses did
not share their notes, using them primarily for their
own record-keeping. When sharing occurred, this often
happened
with
health
professionals
within
the
(extended) family. Some patients mentioned the possi-
bility of actively withholding information during a visit
because of the chance of other people reading it, espe-
cially
when
visits
included
discussions
about
their
spouses or family. Some noted that open notes could
produce more efficient and structured, yet less ‘private’
visits, and views differed on whether this represented a
loss or gain. Frequent users seemed eager to comment
on
notes,
or have
parts
changed/adjusted
(‘custo-
mised’). While some desired an option to approve a
note, coauthoring of notes was not their first choice. “I
just don’t want anyone to share it. … That’s my own per-
sonal thing.”, “I had it in writing for extended family to
see also.”, “The patient should have an opportunity to
comment, and the doctor give feedback.”
Self-care, control and engagement
These high users reported feelings of control and
reduced helplessness, as well as active encouragement
(feeling encouraged through reading the notes to take
care of oneself or reflect on a visit and ask self-reliant
questions). Control came up particularly for patients
with mental health problems, with poor or fair health,
and for men. These patients also referred to their ability
to self-coordinate through the use of open notes.
Patients described open notes as a stimulus or tool for
helping
them
understand
the
importance of
their
playing an active, part-taking (‘patient-centered’) role in
their own care. Member checking through individual
interviews,
however,
revealed
a
distinction
between
patient-centredness as a ‘whole person’ (feels that the
‘system’ is built around the individual patient) and the
actual experience of ‘being at the centre of concern’,
which referred more to the actual problem that a
patient presented, and how it was addressed. For the fre-
quent users, their personal engagement seemed linked
to the actual use of this tool. However, frequent users
were not ‘obsessive’ about reading their notes; reading
each note usually occurred once or twice. Additionally,
frequency of reading was not correlated with self-rated
health of patients. Overall, patients who felt more in
control, more motivated, and had better understanding
of their health, may have translated these sentiments
into better self-management abilities. Quotes: “I take an
active role … that’s a tool to make that happen.”, “It
made me feel … proactive … and not just reacting.”, “I
want to know what’s happening. I want to be right at the
forefront.”, “I am at the center of concern. I am not
powerless.”
DISCUSSION
Not surprisingly, frequent users of open notes reported
positive experiences, with commentaries that suggest
that patient activation and engagement may be fostered
in important ways. Drawing on free-text commentary
and detailed encounters with patients who have used
open notes frequently over a couple of years, our ana-
lyses suggest that as patients reflect on the experience,
their thoughts fall into five themes (domains) that focus
on understanding, relationships, quality, self-care and
hopes for the future. Within these themes, understand-
ing came up most frequently, with emphasis on using
doctors’ notes for refreshing memory and improving or
confirming understanding of one’s own health informa-
tion. In addition, patients pointed to increased trust,
improved management of medications, and a stronger
sense of control, and they hoped that easy access to
doctors’ notes would become more widespread.
These findings complement other studies. Earnest
et al70 reported that of all medical record components
offered online, patients with congestive heart failure
accessed their visit notes the most and felt empowered
by this option. Patients in studies by Bjoernes et al41 and
Pagliari et al31 were positive about experiences with open
medical records, reporting improved communication
and trust between patients and professionals, confidence
in self-care, compliance and accuracy of records (also
see Pyper et al,71 Honeyman et al,72 Woods et al,49 Nazi
et al50). In addition, Pyper et al attributed transparent
clinician–patient interaction through personal health
records to enhanced patient responsibility, participation
and
knowledge,
overall
health
and quality of life,
improved accessibility and relationships with health pro-
fessionals,
better
care
collaboration,
and
decreased
errors and costs.
Two-thirds of the high-use patients in our study chose
not to share notes with others. Despite multiple office
visits, these patients were well enough to complete
online surveys and to be interviewed. Perhaps reading
notes is particularly important to those who, despite

utilisation,
manage
their

health
without
support from other caregivers. This population of high
users also demonstrated high affinity towards self-care
and active engagement. Code frequency analysis in the
self-care domain and individual interviews revealed that
this subset of patients is strongly motivated, active and
engaged in their care.
Importantly, this finding was not always reflected in
the PAM-13 scores, leading to the hypothesis that for a
patient with chronic illness and debilitating limitations,
a positive attitude towards self-care may need to be dis-
tinguished from actual ability to be active and self-
engaged. Physical or situational factors, above and
beyond engagement and activation formally assessed by
PAM, may be of prime importance in this context.
However, Mosen et al73 tested PAM among adults with
chronic conditions and found that patients with high
scores were more likely to perform self-management
behaviours or report high medication adherence, com-
pared to patients with the lowest scores. This needs to
be examined more thoroughly in future studies.
Another aspect that deserves more attention in future
research is the applicability of open notes to target groups.
Previous
studies48
found,
for
example,
that
about
one-third of the overall study population had privacy con-
cerns, but this was not reflected in the subset of high users
examined in our study (about 15%), suggesting that
ongoing use of open notes might decrease privacy con-
cerns over time. Patient comments in interviews also
support this view. Some researchers, however, assume
underreporting of safety or privacy concerns in the
context of EHR use.74 Despite some patients truly experi-
encing challenges, they, in general, seem to value, benefit
from and report predominantly positive experiences with
health record transparency and the open sharing of
notes.49 50 The area of privacy and a possible relation to
frequency of use, or burden of illness, needs further study.
Our findings are primarily hypothesis generating, and
they are clearly limited in terms of generalisability, but we
believe they carry some weight. We approached the
research questions from multiple perspectives, combining
different study arms and techniques. With formally devel-
oped design and measures, including prestudy explora-
tions to support the construction of interview guides, our
goal was both to reflect and refer to the full body of exist-
ing literature and knowledge in the field. In addition, we
combined analyses of free-text survey data with qualitative
interviews in which purposefully selected information-rich
study participants offered insights on the patient experi-
ence. We were guided by the standards of data triangula-
tion, analysis and legitimation and tried to minimise biases.
Despite all these efforts, the possibility of biased con-
clusions persists. Participants in the study differed from
a majority of patients nationally by virtue of having regis-
tered on secure electronic patient portals. Moreover, we
included
patients
from
only
one
health
system
(BIDMC). This may also have caused health literacy and
educational biases, which should be more thoroughly
addressed in future studies. Since the interviewer (TE)
was a doctor, patients may have offered responses
different from what might have been elicited by a
non-medical interviewer. Finally, attitude towards ‘their’
hospital, or ‘their’ doctor, or the use of the secure
patient portal in general, or EHR use, may have affected
responses (halo effects should be considered in both
directions).
Our results highlight some areas for additional consid-
eration. Some patients reported withholding informa-
tion to avoid the chance that others might see it. Some
wanted delayed access in order to allow time for bad
news to be relayed by their doctors before reading it in
the note. Some wanted to comment on notes or to
correct them. To the best of our knowledge, portals and
electronic medical records cannot currently handle indi-
vidual patient preferences such as who can see what, or
interactivity allowing commentary or other input from
patients. We will need to develop these capabilities to be
responsive to engaged and activated patients.
The OpenNotes movement has now spread to a
growing number of organisations around the USA and
has extended beyond primary care to include medical
and surgical specialists, professionals focusing on mental
disorders, nurses, physical therapists and other clini-
cians.75 76 As the practice spreads, both consumers and
health professionals have called for open notes to
become the standard of care.47 77 In ‘traditional’ prac-
tice (not providing patients with online access to their
notes), 50% of patients may leave office visits without an
adequate recall or understanding of what the physician
has told them.78 The American College of Physicians
now expects increased transparency through open notes
and improved clinical documentation, also calling for
broad-based efforts for patient education, explaining,
for example, that a good medical note should be accur-
ate but brief, and not a verbatim transcript of clinical
interaction.79 Also, in examining missed and inappropri-
ate diagnoses, the Institute of Medicine has recently
recommended the adoption of open notes, in an
attempt to mobilise patients and their families as active
witnesses and evaluators of care.80
CONCLUSIONS
Open notes may increase patient activation and engage-
ment in important ways. Patients in this evaluation
suggest that reading notes helped improve their under-
standing of health information, fostered better relation-
ships with doctors, improved the processes of care, and
helped with self-care. They are also interested in becom-
ing involved more actively in the generation of their
medical records. As the use of fully open and transpar-
ent medical records spreads, it is important to gain a
deeper understanding of the possible benefits or harms,
and to characterise target populations that may require
varying modes of delivery. Studying and exploring these
aspects more deeply in the future will be important for

 developing a richer understanding of the effects of fully
transparent records. However, for now, comments from
one of the patients seem sensible:
“I do think that transparency is key and is quality of
care. I think it’s important for patients to understand
truthfully what their situation is and how they can help
themselves and be educated enough to be able to ask
the right questions to physicians. Every patient has that
right … and I think that OpenNotes helps that.”
