On 29 June 2015, Liberia’s respite from Ebola virus disease (EVD) was interrupted for the second time by a renewed
outbreak (“flare-up”) of seven confirmed cases. We demonstrate that, similar to the March 2015 flare-up associated
with sexual transmission, this new flare-up was a reemergence of a Liberian transmission chain originating
from a persistently infected source rather than a reintroduction from a reservoir or a neighboring country with
active transmission. Although distinct, Ebola virus (EBOV) genomes from both flare-ups exhibit significantly low
genetic divergence, indicating a reduced rate of EBOV evolution during persistent infection. Using this rate of
change as a signature, we identified two additional EVD clusters that possibly arose from persistently infected
sources. These findings highlight the risk of EVD flare-ups even after an outbreak is declared over.
INTRODUCTION
After a roughly 2-year-long struggle, all known chains of human-to-
human Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission have finally been stopped
in Western Africa. However, the region remains under enhanced surveil-
lance to rapidly detect any cases associated with a missed transmission
chain or a reintroduction of the disease. As of 28 February 2016, 28,639
EVD cases had been reported by the World Health Organization
(WHO), including 11,316 associated deaths. Liberia was the first of
the three heavily affected Western African countries to interrupt active
transmission of Ebola virus (EBOV) from symptomatic individuals
(February 2015). Since then, the country has experienced three renewed
outbreaks (“flare-ups”) of EVD. The first occurred in March 2015,
resulting in one confirmed case; the second started in June 2015, result-
ing in seven confirmed cases; and the third occurred in November 2015,
resulting in three confirmed cases. For all three flare-ups, no known
symptomatic source could be identified, suggesting a deviation from
the typical human-to-human transmission involving an acutely infected
individual. The March 2015 case was ultimately shown to be associated
with male-to-female sexual transmission from a persistently infected EVD
survivor,demonstratinganadditionalmechanismforEBOVinfection(1).
Here, we use epidemiological and genomic data to investigate
the source of the second Liberian flare-up, centered in Margibi County
during June to July 2015. We demonstrate that this second flare-up,
like the first, originated from a persistently infected source within
Liberia. The viral genomes from the first and second flare-ups were
characterized by significantly low levels of genetic divergence compared
to other viral genomes sequenced from samples collected from infected
persons in Liberia during the epidemic, indicating a reduced rate of
EBOV evolution during persistent infections.
RESULTS
Liberia’s second EVD flare-up occurred during June to July 2015
On 28 June 2015 (101 days after the previous confirmed case of EVD
in Liberia), an oral swab was collected from a deceased 17-year-old
male (from the village of Needowein) during routine EVD surveillance
in Margibi County. One day later, the sample tested positive for
EBOV RNA by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR). From 30 June to 12 July, seven additional epide-
miologically linked individuals with current or recent EVD-like clinical
signs were identified. Each of the seven patients was transported to an
Ebola (virus disease) treatment unit. Six patients tested positive for
EBOV RNA via qRT-PCR, and one of these individuals subsequently
died. The seventh patient’s tests were indeterminate (positive with one
assay and negative with another). The surviving patients and their
families, friends, and contacts were interviewed about recent activities,
including travel to neighboring countries with ongoing EBOV transmis-
sion, hosting of visitors, funeral attendance, sexual contact with EVD
survivors, and/or consumption of bats or nonhuman primates. How-
ever, no such activities were reported.

 defined by Ladner et al. (2)] were assembled from eight samples from
five patients in the Needowein flare-up (Table 1). All eight genome
sequences were nearly identical, collectively differing at only three sites
(positions 3171, 5219, and 18764; table S1). Phylogenetic comparison
with other EBOV sequences from Western Africa indicated that the
Needowein flare-up was a continuation of the Western African EVD
outbreak that began in 2013 and was not caused by an independent
introduction from an unknown nonhuman reservoir (Fig. 1A). Viral
sequences from these five patients shared eight derived substitutions
with other sequences from Western Africa (compared to the first three
genomes from the Western African outbreak; GenBank: KJ660346,
KJ660347, and KJ660348) (3), and each viral genome had at least
one additional substitution unique to the Needowein flare-up (posi-
tion 10130; table S1). More specifically, the new sequences fell within
a predominantly Liberian sublineage (LB2) derived from the SL2 lin-
eage (4, 5) (Fig. 1). The SL2 lineage is distinct from the lineages that
were circulating in Guinea and Sierra Leone (GN1, SL3, and SL4;
Fig. 1A) (6, 7), the only two countries with active EBOV transmission
during and just before the Needowein flare-up. Therefore, it is unlikely
that the Needowein flare-up was caused by the reintroduction of
EBOV into Liberia from a neighboring country. Rather, this cluster
appears to have originated from the reemergence of a virus from a
previous Liberian EBOV transmission chain.
Flare-up was linked to the Barclay Farm EVD cluster during
August to September 2014
The epidemiological investigation revealed that multiple relatives of two
patients (LIBR4808/4866 and LIBR5046) in the Needowein flare-up
previously shared a home in the nearby community of Barclay Farm.
Nine of the 22 occupants of the Barclay Farm household had confirmed
EVD during August to September 2014; eight died, and a 13-year-old
male was the only known EVD survivor (Table 1). Interviews revealed
that an adult female from the household, who also resided part-time in
Needowein, had experienced clinical symptoms including body aches
and vision problems in the weeks after caring for her mother, who died
at home of confirmed EVD in August 2014. The adult female self-
treated with unspecified traditional medicine but did not visit a health
care facility or have a sample taken. She also reported having a mis-
carriage following her EVD-like symptoms. By October 2014, she and
at least two relatives relocated permanently from Barclay Farm to
Needowein, where they shared a home with the two Needowein patients
(LIBR4808/4866 and LIBR5046). The 13-year-old survivor from Barclay
Farm (LIBR20004) also moved to Needowein several months later.
To explore a potential connection between the 2014 Barclay Farm
cluster and the 2015 Needowein flare-up, we located frozen serum
samples taken during August to September 2014 from six of the nine
Barclay Farm family members with confirmed EVD (Table 1). Genomic
EBOV sequencing revealed that two of the decedents (LIBR20002 and
LIBR20005) had EBOV genomes that differed by only one substitution
from those in the Needowein flare-up (Fig. 1B and table S1). The other
four genomes, which included the sequence recovered from the sur-
viving 13-year-old male (LIBR20004), proved to not be a component
of the Needowein transmission chain, excluding the boy as a potential
EBOV source (Fig. 1B).
The investigation also revealed that five of the initial Needowein
patients, as well as other community members, had butchered and
consumed a dog that relocated with the family from Barclay Farm, after
it had died on 10 June 2015 (estimated date). However, remains from
the dog carcass and a deceased puppy tested negative for EBOV RNA.
Genomes from flare-up exhibit reduced evolutionary rate
The level of sequence divergence between the Needowein EBOV ge-
nomes and the inferred root of the Liberian portion of the Western
African EVD outbreak was significantly lower than expected, given the

 timing of the Needowein flare-up (Fig. 2). On the basis of patterns of
sequence divergence throughout the Liberian EVD epidemic, we esti-
mated an expected sampling date of 11 September 2014 [95% high-
est posterior density (HPD) interval, 26 July to 9 November 2014]
for the initial Needowein case (Fig. 2B). The difference of more
than 9 months between the observed (28 June 2015) and estimated
sampling dates is equivalent to a roughly 27-fold decrease in the
average rate of substitution on the branch leading to the Needowein
flare-up. We also observed a fivefold reduction in the evolutionary rate
associated with male-to-female sexual transmission of EBOV in March
2015 (Fig. 2B) (1). In that case, the male survivor had first reported
EVD symptoms on 9 September 2014, approximately 6 months before
the sexual transmission event (1). A plasma sample was collected
from the female patient during her acute infection (20 March 2015),
and the assembled EBOV genome (GenBank: KT587343) exhibited
sequence divergence, relative to other Liberian EBOV sequences,
consistent with a sampling date approximately 5 months earlier
(12 October 2014; 95% HPD interval, 23 August to 4 December 2014).
The absence of active Liberian transmission chains before the Needowein
flare-up and the case of sexual transmission led us to consider per-
sistently infected survivors as a possible EBOV source for these flare-ups.
However, transmission from EVD survivors may have also contrib-
uted earlier in the epidemic. Using the signature of a reduced evo-
lutionary rate, we identified other EVD cases possibly linked to
persistently infected individuals. Root-to-tip analysis identified 15 ad-
ditional EBOV genomes (table S2) as outliers with lower-than-expected
sequence divergence (95% prediction interval; Fig. 2A). Among these
outliers were four LB7 sublineage sequences from a Liberian EVD
cluster that occurred during December 2014 to February 2015, centered
in the St. Paul Bridge community in Monrovia, Montserrado County
(8). Other EVD cases were reported in the same area around the time
of the index patient’s onset of symptoms, and the index patient had re-
cently traveled to Grand Cape Mount County, where there was ongoing
human-to-human transmission of EBOV. However, the family of the
index patient reported no known contact with other EVD patients,
and genomic surveillance of samples collected during this period has
not identified other active EBOV transmission chains with LB7 sublin-
eage viruses (fig. S1A). Also among the 15 outliers were six Guinean
EBOV genomes of the LB4 sublineage (5, 9). We were unable to obtain
epidemiological data for these cases, but their timing (1 December 2014
to 27 January 2015), collection sites (neighboring Faranah and Kissidougou
Prefectures in Faranah Region), and sequenced EBOV genomes (Fig. 2B
and fig. S1B) indicate a potential epidemiological link. It is unclear
whether similar links exist between any of the other five outliers (table S2);
one has the basal SL2 haplotype, two are from the LB2 sublineage, and
two are from the LB7 sublineage.
DISCUSSION
The cluster of EVD cases that occurred in and around Needowein vil-
lage during June to July 2015 was the second EVD flare-up in Liberia
following the successful control of the Liberian outbreak (that is,
multiple weeks with no new cases). The first Liberian EVD flare-up
occurred in March 2015 in Montserrado County. This first flare-up
has been attributed to sexual transmission from a persistently and sub-
clinically infected male Liberian EVD survivor and was limited to a
single case (1). Although larger in scale, our genetic analysis has indi-
cated that the Needowein flare-up also represents the reemergence of a
Liberian EBOV transmission chain. Given the ongoing surveillance in
Liberia during this period and the absence of an EVD case in Liberia
for 3 months before this flare-up, this finding indicates that the Needowein
flare-up originated from a persistently infected source.
We established both epidemiological and genetic links between the
Needowein flare-up and a cluster of EVD cases that occurred nearly

 1 year earlier in the nearby Barclay Farm community. However, we
were not able to definitively identify the persistently infected source for
the Needowein flare-up. We assembled two EBOV genomes from
Barclay Farm patients (LIBR20002 and LIBR20005) that differed from
those obtained during the Needowein flare-up by only one nucleotide.
Such genetic similarity is consistent with direct transmission (1); how-
ever, these two Barclay Farm patients had died in August 2014. The
woman from Barclay Farm, who relocated to Needowein, is a potential
source. However, her presumed EBOV infection was never confirmed,
and EBOV transmission from a persistently infected female survivor
has not yet been documented. The dog, which was also relocated from
Barclay Farm to Needowein, is another potential source. However, there
is currently no conclusive evidence that dogs can even become infected
with EBOV (10), let alone serve as intermediate hosts for human infec-
tion. Alternatively, the source might have been an unidentified survivor
with an epidemiological link to the cluster of cases in Barclay Farm.
Margibi County was heavily affected by EVD during August to September
2014, with an average of 74 confirmed and probable cases reported
weekly (11).
The sexual transmission case (first flare-up), the Needowein cluster
(second flare-up), and the outlier cases identified from earlier in the
epidemic (table S2) indicate that reduced rates of EBOV evolution can
occur under certain circumstances and that persistent, subclinical in-
fection is likely one such circumstance. Similar reductions in evolution-
ary rate have been observed during persistent infections of human
parvovirus B19 (12); however, the mechanisms responsible for such
reductions are poorly understood, especially for RNA viruses. Currently,
there are no known mechanisms for persistence in the absence of
replication (that is, dormancy) for RNA viruses without a DNA stage.
However, the observed reduction in the rate of evolution could be ex-
plained by a reduced rate of viral replication (13). After the acute phase
of EVD, EBOV RNA can no longer be detected in blood, but the virus
can persist in immune-privileged sites, such as the eye and testes (14, 15),
where EBOV may replicate more slowly.
The primary goal of this investigation was to quickly interrupt trans-
mission of EVD and prevent further spread. This goal was accomplished,
and on 3 September 2015, Liberia was again declared free of EVD (16).
However, during 20 to 21 November 2015, three additional epidemio-
logically linked EVD cases were confirmed in Liberia. Genomic inves-
tigation into the source for these cases is ongoing, but given the time lapse
since the last EVD case in Liberia, we speculate that this new cluster is
also linked to the reemergence of a previous transmission chain. Although
transmission from persistent infections appears to be relatively rare, per-
sistent subclinical EBOV infections have been shown to occur in male
EVD survivors (14), and single transmission events from persistent infec-
tions have the potential to reignite person-to-person EBOV transmission
via the typical route (that is, via contact with body fluids of a symptomatic
person). Fortunately, Liberia’s rapid response to these postepidemic
clusters has quickly interrupted transmission. Liberia, Sierra Leone, and
Guinea will need to maintain heightened vigilance during the coming
months, or perhaps longer, to rapidly contain any future flare-ups.

Work conducted at the Liberian Institute for Biomedical Research
(LIBR) was carried out with the consent of the National Incident
Management System of the Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak and
the Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, and was supervised
by the LIBR institutional review board. All the information obtained
from the participants was anonymized for this report.
RNA was extracted from serum samples using the QIAamp Viral
RNA Mini Extraction Kit on a Qiagen EZ1 extraction robot and tested
for the presence of EBOV RNA by the LIBR reference laboratory.
Samples were prepared using a modified version of the Illumina
RNA Access Kit as previously described (1). Samples were prepared
multiple times and different fragmentation times were used to obtain
optimal RNA sequencing libraries because of the inability to determine
accurate size distribution of RNA on-site (table S4). Samples prepared
for the 17 September 2015 sequencing run had a modification in the
enrichment protocol (see table S4). Instead of pooling samples in groups
of four before enrichment, we enriched all samples separately and used
a quarter of the reagents for the enrichment. This was done to eliminate
enrichment bias. Samples were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq housed
at the LIBR Genome Center (17).
The random hexamer associated with read 1 and the Illumina adap-
ters were removed from the sequencing reads using Cutadapt version
1.21 (18), and low-quality reads and bases were filtered using PRINSEQ-
lite version 0.20.4 (19). Reads were aligned to the reference using Bowtie
2 (20), duplicates were removed with Picard (http://broadinstitute.
github.io/picard), and a new consensus was generated using a combi-
nation of SAMtools version 0.1.18 (21) and custom scripts. Only bases
with a Phred quality score ≥20 were used in consensus calling, and a
minimum of 3× read-depth coverage, in support of the consensus, was
required to make a call. Positions lacking this depth of coverage were
treated as missing (that is, called “N”).
Genomic analysis
PopART version 1.7.2 (http://popart.otago.ac.nz) was used to create
haplotype networks using the median-joining reconstruction method.
To place the eight Needowein flare-up sequences within the context of
the full Western African outbreak, these sequences were compared to
575 representative EBOV genomes from Guinea, Liberia, Mali, and
Sierra Leone (only sequences with >99% genome coverage; see table
S3 for accession numbers). Because of missing data, 1389 sites (7.3%
of total genome) were excluded from the analysis, including 89 sites
with variability among samples (8.5% of all variable sites). This anal-
ysis indicated that the Needowein genomes belonged to the SL2 line-
age, LB2 sublineage. To further refine the placement of these genomes
within this sublineage, a subset analysis was conducted including the
eight sequences from the Needowein flare-up, six sequences from the
August to September 2014 EVD cluster in Barclay Farm, and all 29
published EBOV genomes from the LB2 sublineage (see table S3 for
accession numbers). Because of missing data, 1834 sites (9.7% of total
genome) were excluded from the analysis, including 10 sites with var-
iability among samples (11.5% of all variable sites).
Path-O-Gen version 1.4 (22) was used to calculate root-to-tip dis-
tances using a maximum-likelihood phylogeny constructed with
PhyML version 3.0 (23) with a general time-reversible model. This anal-
ysis was restricted to Liberian EBOV sequences from the SL2 lineage
with ≥93% genome coverage, as well as EBOV sequences from Guinea
and Mali resulting from reintroductions from Liberia (see table S3 for
accession numbers) (5). Only one sequence (the earliest collected) was
included from each of the Needowein flare-up patients. The phylo-
genetic tree was rooted using LIBR10089 (GenBank: KT725377), which
is one of the two Liberian EBOV sequences identical to the basal SL2
haplotype (5). Robust regression was used to fit a linear model to the
data, excluding the sequences from the Needowein flare-up and the
sexual transmission case, both of which are associated with transmis-
sion from persistently infected sources.
Treating sampling date as a random variable, we used BEAST ver-
sion 1.8.2 (22) to estimate expected sampling times for two Liberian
EBOV genome sequences linked to transmission from persistently
infected sources: the March 2015 case of sexual transmission (GenBank:
KT587343) and the earliest genome from the June to July 2015 Needowein
flare-up (GenBank: KU220269). Sites were partitioned into noncoding
intergenic regions and codon positions 1, 2, and 3. The evolution of all
four site partitions was modeled by independent HKY substitution
models with G4-distributed rate heterogeneity. A relaxed molecular
clock was used with lognormally distributed rate categories (24). The
nonparametric Bayesian SkyGrid tree prior (25) was used. The prior on
the mean of the lognormal distribution [N(1.144 × 10−3, 5.7968 × 10−3)]
was informed by previously estimated rates (5). Markov chain Monte
Carlo was run for 100,000,000 iterations, sampling every 10,000 itera-
tions. The first 10,000,000 iterations were discarded as burn-in.
