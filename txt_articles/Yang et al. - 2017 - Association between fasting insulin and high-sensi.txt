Association between fasting insulin and
high-sensitivity C reactive protein in
Korean adults
June S Yang,1 Jeffry N Gerber,2 Hyun J You3
ABSTRACT
Background High-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-
CRP) is a reliable indicator of atherosclerotic diseases
and is associated with hyperinsulinaemia. The purpose
of this study is to examine the association between hs-
CRP and fasting insulin levels in Korean adults not
taking medication for hypertension, dyslipidaemia or
diabetes, nor provided with specific dietary advice.
Methods This cross-sectional study included 2588
subjects who participated in the 2015 Korean National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. High-risk hs-
CRP was defined as hs-CRP>2 mg/L. Subjects were
divided into four groups with fasting insulin (<5, 5–10,
10–15,>15 uIU/mL)
Results The mean hs-CRP in our sample was
1.22 mg/L. hs-CRP was positively associated with
fasting insulin level. The occurrence of high-risk hs-
CRP with increasing fasting insulin levels was 7.6%,
9.8%, 19.1% and 28.2%, respectively. In comparing
high-risk hs-CRP between the highest (>15 mIU/mL)
and lowest (<5 mIU/mL) insulin groups, the OR
(95% CI) was 4.59 (2.77–7.58). triglycerides/high-
density lipoprotein ratio was also associated with hs-
CRP. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was not
associated with hs-CRP.
Conclusions Higher level of fasting insulin is
positively associated with high-risk hs-CRP.
INTRODUCTION
Several studies have shown that plasma
insulin levels, fasting or after oral glucose
load, are associated with increased risk of
cardiovascular
disease.1–4
This
subject,
however, has been controversial because of
conflicting results through other studies.5–7
Though insulin was associated with risk
factors for cardiovascular disease, it was not
usually
associated
with
cardiovascular
disease itself.
An increase in high-sensitivity C reactive
protein (hs-CRP) is a sensitive marker of
systemic inflammation, and is associated
with
early
atherosclerotic
changes,
thus
predicting
cardiovascular
risk.8
9
hs-
CRP>2 mg/L was defined as high risk for
cardiovascular disease.10
A
few
studies
have
suggested
that
elevated levels of plasma hs-CRP are asso-
ciated
with
insulin
resistance,
hyperinsulinaemia and cardiovascular auto-
nomic dysfunction.11–14
This study was designed to examine the
association
between
hs-CRP
and
fasting
insulin in Korean adults not taking medi-
cations for hypertension, dyslipidaemia or
diabetes,
nor
provided
with
specific
dietary
advice,
by
analysing
the
sixth
Korean
National
Health
and
Nutrition
Examination
Survey
(KNHANES)
performed in 2015.
METHODS
Patients
We analysed the participants of the third
year (2015) of KNHANES VI. KNHANES
was designed to assess the health and nutri-
tional status of adults and children over
What are the new findings?
" An analysis of Korean adults not taking medi-
cines for diabetes, dyslipidaemia and hyperten-
sion also without specific dietary advice showed
that fasting insulin is positively associated with
high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP).
" The OR for high-risk hs-CRP in the subjects
whose fasting insulin was >15 mIU/mL compared
with those whose fasting insulin <5 mIU/mL was
4.59.
" Triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein ratio was
also associated with hs-CRP, but low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol was not associated with
hs-CRP.
How might it impact on clinical practice in
the near future?
" Findings support an insulin-lowering lifestyle
modification
for
preventing
cardiovascular
disease.

 1 year of age. Specifically, KNHANES targeted the non-
institutionalised
civilian
Korean
population.
The
KNHANES
VI
was
a
cross-sectional
and
nationally representative survey conducted by the Divi-
sion of Chronic Disease Surveillance, Korea Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention from 2013 to 2015. The
data collected consisted of a health interview survey, a
health examination survey and a nutrition survey. A
detailed description of the sampling method used was
published in the 2013 KNHANES.15
In this survey, 12 528 individuals in 4600 households
were sampled, with 9308 of them participating in the
health interviews and health examination surveys, and
8641 participating in the nutrition surveys. Among
those who participated in the survey between January
2015 and December 2015, fasting insulin levels and hs-
CRP levels were obtained in 2656 males and 3200
females aged 10 years and older from all 16 adminis-
trative
districts
of
South
Korea.
This
study
was
restricted to participants over 20 years of age not
provided with specific dietary advice, insulin injections
or other medications for blood pressure, dyslipidaemia
or diabetes (n=2588).
General characteristics of the subjects
Assessed characteristics included age, gender, anthro-
pometric measurement and health-related behaviours.
Blood pressure was manually measured by trained
examiner, three times, at 30 s intervals, using the
subject’s right arm after a minimum of 5 min of rest in
a seated position. The average of the second and third
readings was considered as the final blood pressure.
Height and weight were measured with the participant
wearing light clothing and no shoes. Body mass index
(BMI) was computed as weight (kg) divided by the
height (m) squared. Waist circumference was measured
by placing a tape measure at the midpoint between the
inferior margin of the last rib and the iliac crest in the
midaxillary plane, while the participant maintained a
full expiratory position.
Information on health-related behaviours such as
smoking status (non-smoker, ex-smoker or current
smoker), alcohol intake (less than once per month, less
than once per week or more than twice per week) and
regular physical activity of moderate intensity (less or
more than three times per week) was obtained from the
health questionnaire. Moderate-intensity activities were
defined as those lasting at least 10 min and causing a
slight increase in the individual’s heart rate compared
with sedentary activities; table tennis, swimming, yoga
and badminton were included as moderate-intensity
activities, but walking was excluded.
Dietary assessment
Dietary data were collected from the KNHANES using
a 24-hour recall. Intake of macronutrients was calcu-
lated based on 24-hour recall data. The ratio of energy
from each macronutrient was calculated.
Biochemical measurements
Blood samples were obtained after overnight fasting.
Blood samples were collected from each participant
during the survey and were processed, immediately
refrigerated and transported in cold storage to the
Central Testing Institute in Seoul, Korea. The serum

for
continuous variables and percentages with 95% CI for
categorical variables. An independent two-sample t test
was used to compare two independent groups. We
performed complex samples general linear model
analysis to investigate the association between insulin
and hs-CRP. The complex samples logistic regression
analysis was employed to obtain the OR associated
insulin and hs-CRP after adjusting for sex and age.
Subjects with serum insulin <5 mIU/mL were selected
as the reference group because this was the range asso-
ciated with the lowest hs-CRP. All p values were
two tailed and results were considered statistically
significant if the p values were<0.05.
RESULTS
The cross-sectional analyses included data on 2588
participants (1162 men and 1426 women), aged �20
years, not provided with specific dietary advice, insulin
injections or other medications for high blood pres-
sure, dyslipidaemia or diabetes. The mean age of the
study participants was 42.95±0.37. Table 1 shows the
general characteristics of the study participants. LDL-C
was directly measured in all of subjects.
Then, subjects were segmented into four insulin
groups
as
follows:
serum
insulin

occurrence of high-risk hs-CRP in the lowest insulin
group was 7.92%±0.97% while those in the highest
insulin group was 28.29%±4.04% (figure 1). The OR
for high-risk hs-CRP in the highest fasting insulin
group compared with the lowest fasting insulin group
was 4.59 (95% CI 2.77 to 7.58) (table 4). After multiple

 To compare the effects of fasting insulin with the asso-
ciation between TG/HDL ratio and hs-CRP, subjects
were divided into four groups as TG/HDL ratio <2, 2–4,
4–6 and >6. The OR for high-risk hs-CRP between TG/
HDL groups were 1.71, 2.17, 2.79, respectively (table 5,
p=<0.001).
After subjects were divided as serum levels of LDL-C
(<70, 70–120, 120–170, >170), there was no signifi-
cant differences in hs-CRP among groups (table 6,
p=0.748). LDL-C was not associated with hs-CRP.
There was no significant difference between subjects
lower than 70 mg/dL of LDL-C and higher than
170 mg/dL.
DISCUSSION
Our results based on the Korea National Health and
Nutrition
Examination
Survey
2015
showed
that
elevated fasting insulin levels were associated with
increased high-risk hs-CRP (>2 mg/L). This association
was independent of other lifestyle factors, including
smoking, alcohol, physical activity and total energy
intake.
In the Helsinki Policeman Study, age-adjusted HR
for major CHD risk during 10 years comparing men in
the highest area under curve
insulin quintile with
those in the combined four lower quintiles was 2.72
(95% CI 1.67 to 4.42).3 In the most recent meta-anal-
ysis including 14 studies, however, the OR for CHD
compared the top third of fasting insulin with the

 bottom third was weak, 1.12 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.28).16
The precision of method used for measuring insulin
and fasting time may be an explanation for this
disparity.
On the other hand, hyperinsulinaemia was associated
with multiple risk factors for CHD as obesity, hyperten-
sion, impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes,
hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia in
the San Antonio Heart Study.17
In a cross-sectional study of 1525 Peruvian adults,
CRP was positively associated with fasting insulin.11 A
cross-sectional study in Japan showed that the hs-CRP
level of 121 male subjects was positively associated with
fasting insulin.12 A case–control study of 35 patients
with type 2 diabetes showed that fasting plasma insulin
was higher in the increased hs-CRP group.13Compared
with lower hs-CRP subjects, higher hs-CRP group in
euglycaemic healthy young adults recorded increased
insulin level during oral glucose tolerance test.14
A number of studies have reported that low-grade
inflammation is a novel risk factor in all stages of athero-
sclerosis and acute coronary syndrome, which can be
measured as hs-CRP.18 The American College of Cardi-
ology / American Heart Association guidelines on the
assessment of cardiovascular risk acknowledged hs-
CRP >2 mg/L as a risk assessment option.10
In our study, higher level of fasting insulin was posi-
tively associated with high-risk hs-CRP. These findings
are consistent with reports from various cross-sectional,
case–control and clinical trial studies of other popula-
tions. There was also a dose–response relationship
among the different insulin groups. Additionally, fasting
insulin was positively associated with BMI, waist circum-
ference, SBP and DBP, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c,
total cholesterol, TG, LDL-C, TG/HDL ratio, ALT and
AST. Fasting insulin was negatively associated with age
and HDL-C. Many of these results are characterised as
markers of metabolic syndrome. In fact, fasting insulin
may be used as a marker for metabolic syndrome.
Subject group divided into different levels of LDL-C
(direct measurement) were not associated with hs-CRP.
This result may be in agreement with the previous
observation that LDL-C was not associated with major
coronary events.19 TG/HDL ratio is another marker for
metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and cardiovas-
cular disease.20 Subjects divided into different TG/HDL
ratio group showed an association with high-risk CRP
and dose–response relationship. In case of familial
hypertriglyceridaemia
or
familial
hypercholestero-
laemia, however, TG/HDL ratio cannot be a proper
measure for cardiovascular risk. Fasting insulin espe-
cially may be a good option for those cases.
Our
study
included
numerous
subjects
in
a
national survey which involved a large, nationwide,
population-based
sampling
and
also
involved
the
collection
of
extensive
data
including
potential
confounders. All covariates were reliable and stand-
ardised through the use of a uniform questionnaire
and
surveillance
protocol.
Cross-sectional
study
design,
however,
is
an
important
limitation
that
should be considered when interpreting the result of
our study. It is difficult to determine a causal rela-
tionship
between
fasting
insulin
and
hs-CRP.
Whether
higher
level
of
insulin
promotes
minor
inflammation
or
minor
inflammation
aggravates
insulin resistance cannot be determined.
CONCLUSION
The
results
of
this
study
demonstrate
a
positive
association between fasting insulin level and hs-CRP
in
a
nationally
representative
sample
of
Korean
adults after controlling for confounders. Comparing
high-risk
hs-CRP
(>2 mg/L)
between
the
highest
(>15
mIU/mL)
and
lowest
(<5
mIU/mL)
insulin
groups, the OR (95% CI) was 4.59 (2.77–7.58). TG/
HDL ratio was also associated with hs-CRP. LDL-C
was not associated with hs-CRP.
