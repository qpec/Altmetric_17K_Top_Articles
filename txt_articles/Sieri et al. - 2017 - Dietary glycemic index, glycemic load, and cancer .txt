Factors linked to glucose metabolism are involved in the etiology of several cancers. High glycemic 
index (GI) or high glycemic load (GL) diets, which chronically raise postprandial blood glucose, may 
increase cancer risk by affecting insulin-like growth factor. We prospectively investigated cancer risk and 
dietary GI/GL in the EPIC-Italy cohort. After a median 14.9 years, 5112 incident cancers and 2460 deaths 
were identified among 45,148 recruited adults. High GI was associated with increased risk of colon and 
bladder cancer. High GL was associated with: increased risk of colon cancer; increased risk of diabetes-
related cancers; and decreased risk of rectal cancer. High intake of carbohydrate from high GI foods 
was significantly associated with increased risk of colon and diabetes-related cancers, but decreased 
risk of stomach cancer; whereas high intake of carbohydrates from low GI foods was associated with 
reduced colon cancer risk. In a Mediterranean population with high and varied carbohydrate intake, 
carbohydrates that strongly raise postprandial blood glucose may increase colon and bladder cancer 
risk, while the quantity of carbohydrate consumed may be involved in diabetes-related cancers. Further 
studies are needed to confirm the opposing effects of high dietary GL on risks of colon and rectal 
cancers.
Factors linked to glucose metabolism seem to be involved in the etiology of several cancers1–4. Consumption of 
most carbohydrates increases blood glucose and blood insulin, but to varying extents, depending on carbohy-
drate type and processing, amount consumed, and presence of other nutrients. These variations are captured by 
the glycemic index (GI)5, which ranks carbohydrate foods according to their ability to raise blood glucose levels. 
High GI foods, like white bread, are rapidly digested and cause a rapid peak in blood glucose. Low GI foods like 
pulses and pasta, are digested more slowly, prompting a more gradual rise in blood glucose. Glycemic load (GL), 
the product of a food’s GI and its available carbohydrate content, was introduced to incorporate the effect of the 
total amount of carbohydrate consumed: it is a measure of total glycemic effect, and is hence an indicator of the 
insulin demand of the diet.
Several observational studies have investigated associations between dietary GI/GL and risk of different types 
of cancer, but have produced mixed results. Three meta-analyses −
 one that investigated only cohort studies6, and 
others that considered both case-control and cohort studies7, 8 – found that high GI was associated with increased 
risk of colorectal cancer. Meta-analyses also found that high GI and GL were weakly associated with increased 
risk of breast cancer9 and diabetes-related cancers6, while high GL was associated with increased risk of endo-
metrial cancer6. The risks of developing other cancers do not appear to be influenced by dietary GI or GL6, 7, 10, 11.
Associations of dietary GI/GL with colorectal and breast cancer have been investigated previously in per-
sons recruited to the Italian section of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition 
(EPIC-Italy)12, 13. It was found that high GI was significantly associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer12, 
and high dietary GL was significantly associated with increased risk of breast cancer13. In the present study we

updated the follow-up of the EPIC-Italy cohort in order to assess associations of dietary GI and GL with various 
types of cancer.
Results
Characteristics of participants in the upper and lower quintiles of GI and GL are shown in Table 1. Mean dietary 
GI ranged from 50.0 in the lowest to 57.4 in the highest quintile. GL ranged from 86 g in the lowest to 235 g (glu-
cose equivalents) in the highest. Participants in the highest GI quintile consumed more carbohydrate, especially 
more carbohydrate from high GI foods, more fiber, and more alcohol, but less fat especially saturated and mon-
ounsaturated fat, than those in the lowest GI quintile. Participants in the highest GL quintile consumed more 
carbohydrate, fiber, fat, alcohol, and energy than those in the lowest quintile. Those in the highest GI and GL 
quintiles smoked more, and those in the highest GI quintile had a slightly higher BMI than those in the lowest. 
Participants in the highest GL quintile were younger and more educated than those in the lowest.
Dietary GI (Table 2) was not associated with risk of all cancers combined, but high GI was associated with 
increased risk of colon cancer (HR 1.48, 95%CI 1.09–2.01 highest vs. lowest quintile; P trend 0.027) and bladder 
cancer (HR 1.51, 95%CI 1.01–2.25 highest vs. lowest quintile; P trend 0.042). GI was not associated with any other 
cancer.
Dietary GL (Table 3) was not associated with increased risk of all cancers combined, but high GL was associ-
ated with increased risk of colon cancer (HR 1.80, 95%CI 1.18–2.74 highest vs. lowest quintile; P trend 0.010), and 
increased risk of DRCs (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.03–1.48 highest vs. lowest quintile; P trend 0.015), as well as decreased 
risk of rectal cancer (HR 0.42, 95%CI 0.18–0.98 highest vs. lowest quintile; P trend 0.047).
As shown in Table 4, high intake of high GI carbohydrate was associated with decreased risk of stomach 
cancer (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27–0.94 highest vs. lowest quintile; P trend 0.045), increased risk of colon cancer (HR 
1.71, 95% CI 1.19–2.44 highest vs. lowest quintile; P trend 0.004) and increased risk of DRCs (HR 1.23, 95% CI 
1.05–1.44 highest vs. lowest quintile; P trend 0.011). High intake of carbohydrate from low GI foods was associ-
ated with lowered risk of colon cancer (P trend 0.032) and mortality (P trend 0.029).
When participants being treated for diabetes, or diagnosed with cancer during the first 6 months of follow-up 
were excluded, the results did not differ from those cited above and all significant associations remained signif-
icant or nearly so. When participants who reported they were dieting were excluded, high dietary GL became 
associated with increased risk of breast cancer (HR 1.34, 95%CI 1.02–1.76 highest vs. lowest quintile; P trend 
0.049; data not shown).
When the analyses on GL/GI and risk of colon cancer were stratified by subsite (proximal and distal), GI 
was significantly associated with distal (HR 1.70, 95%CI 1.08–2.67 highest vs. lowest quintile) but not proximal 
colon cancer (HR 1.32, 95%CI 0.84–2.10 highest vs. lowest quintile). High intake of high GI carbohydrate was 
associated with increased risk of distal colon cancer (HR 2.23, 95%CI 1.33–3.74 highest vs. lowest quintile; P 
trend 0.011). The results for GL and low GI carbohydrate did not differ between proximal and distal sites. (data 
not shown in Tables).

Discussion
The main findings of our study are that high dietary GI was significantly associated with increased risk of colon 
and bladder cancer; whereas high dietary GL was significantly associated with increased risk of colon cancer and 
DRCs (which include colon cancer), but decreased risk of rectal cancer. Furthermore, high carbohydrate intake 
from high GI foods was significantly associated with increased risk of colon cancer and DRCs, but decreased 
risk of stomach cancer, whereas high carbohydrate intake from low GI foods was significantly associated with 
decreased risk of colon cancer.
Our finding that high dietary GI, high dietary GL, and high carbohydrate intake from high GI foods, are 
associated with increased colon cancer risk is in line with the previous EPIC-Italy study12 which found that high 
dietary GI (but not GL) and high consumption of carbohydrates from high GI foods, were associated with signif-
icantly increased colon cancer risk. Like the present study, which considered 122 more colon cancer cases than 
the previous study, our previous study12 also found that high consumption of carbohydrates from low GI foods 
was associated with lowered colon cancer risk: thus taken together the results of both studies suggest that colon 
cancer risk depends more on the ability of the carbohydrate foods consumed to raise postprandial blood glucose 
than the overall quantity of carbohydrate consumed.
An alternative interpretation would be that high consumption of highly refined carbohydrates reduces con-
sumption of carbohydrates from low GI foods and hence also reduces consumption of polyphenols and other 
antioxidants which may protect against colon cancer14.
Several cohort studies have examined associations between dietary GI/GL and risk of colon or colorectal 
cancer. Most found no association, however two15, 16 are in broad agreement with our findings: the George et al. 
study15 found that high dietary GI was associated with modestly increased risk of colorectal cancer in men but 
not women; the Women’s Health Study16 found that colorectal cancer risk in women was significantly associated 
with high GL, while the increased risk associated with high GI was not significant. As regards meta-analyses, one 
published in 2009 (case-control and cohort studies)17 and another in 201218 (cohort studies) found no evidence 
of links between dietary GI/GL and colorectal cancer. However other meta-analyses of cohort and case-control7, 
8 and cohort6 studies found that high GI, but not GL, was associated with increased risk of colorectal or colon 
cancer. By contrast, we found that colon cancer risk increased significantly with increasing GL (as well as GI) in 
agreement with a single meta-analysis published in 200819.
We expected that high dietary GL would increase the risk of both colon and rectal cancer (both are DRCs)20 
but instead found that high GL was associated with significantly lowered risk of rectal cancer. It is known that eti-
ologic factors for the two cancers differ21–23; that colon and rectum derive from different segments of embryonic

intestinal tract, and differ in function, pH, and exposure to feces22, 23; furthermore levels of several bacterial enzymes 
involved in the production of mutagenic metabolites vary regionally within the large bowel24. Any of these differ-
ences could have contributed to the opposing effects of high dietary GL on risks of colon and rectal cancers. We 
have noted previously that high total antioxidant intake, and high adherence to an index of Mediterranean diet had 
contrasting associations with risks of colon and rectal cancers in the EPIC-Italy cohort25, 26.
As regards bladder cancer, we found that high dietary GI was associated with increased risk of this disease. 
This is consistent with the finding of a 2013 case-control study27 that the highest quartile of dietary GI was associ-
ated with significantly increased bladder cancer risk. However, although a meta-analysis6 found that risk of DRCs 
was increased in those with high GI (but not GL), when bladder cancer was considered separately, risk was unaf-
fected by GI. Furthermore, a 2009 cohort study15 found no association of dietary GL/GI with bladder cancer risk.
Unexpectedly, we found that high carbohydrate from high GI foods was associated with significantly lowered 
risk of stomach cancer. This result is not inconsistent with the findings of a cohort study28 and a case-control 
study29, both of which found that risk of stomach cancer reduced slightly (not significant) as dietary GI and GL 
increased. Nevertheless a 2016 meta-analysis that analyzed 2 cohort and 4 case-control studies found no signif-
icant association between dietary GI/GL and stomach cancer11. It is possible that many people who eventually 
develop stomach cancer have problems digesting foods years before diagnosis and change their diet to mitigate 
these problems, thus masking any association between carbohydrate intake and this cancer. Stomach cancer risk 
has been found to be inversely related to socioeconomic status30 which could confound the association with high 
GI foods. However when we adjusted for a proxy of socioeconomic status, results did not change.
As regards DRCs, we found that high dietary GL was significantly associated with increased risk of developing 
these cancers. This is broadly consistent the results of a meta-analysis6 that evaluated 60 811 patients considered 
to have a DRC from 36 prospective cohort studies. The study found a ‘modest-to-weak’ (significant) association 
between high dietary GI (but not GL) and risk of developing a DRC. Although we found no association between 
DRCs and dietary GI, we did find that high carbohydrate intake from high GI foods was significantly associated 
with increased risk of DRCs. Taken together these findings suggest that increased risk of DRCs may be conferred 
not by a carbohydrate-rich diet, but by one rich in rapidly-absorbed carbohydrate.
As regards overall cancer risk, our data indicate no association with dietary GI/GL. As far as we are aware just 
one cohort study has examined associations between GI/GL and overall cancer risk15. This study found that high 
GI was associated with increased risk of total cancer in men but not women, while high GL was associated with 
reduced overall cancer risk in both men and women.

For breast cancer, we found that neither GI nor GL had any significant association with the risk of this disease. 
However a subgroup analysis that excluded participants who reported they were dieting at recruitment found that 
high GL was significantly associated increased breast cancer risk (HR 1.34, 95%CI 1.02–1.76 highest vs. lowest 
quintile; P trend 0.049). This result is fully consistent with our previous analysis of breast cancer in EPIC-Italy13.

This study, which ab initio excluded all those who were dieting, also found that high GL was significantly associ-
ated with increased risk. The present subgroup analysis involved 507 more breast cancer cases and had approxi-
mately three more years of follow-up than our original study13. A 2016 meta-analysis of 12 cohort studies found 
that both high GI and GL were significantly associated with modestly increased risk of breast cancer9.
Regarding endometrial cancer, all published meta-analyses7, 19, 31–34 report a direct significant association 
between dietary GL and risk of endometrial cancer. However we found that although the risk of this cancer 
increased with increasing GL quintiles, the increases were never significant and P trend was 0.176. We only had 
203 cases, so the lack of a significant association could be due to insufficient power.
Although several etiological hypotheses have been put forward, chronically high blood glucose giving rise to 
hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and enhanced bioactivity of the IGF axis (and in particular of the potent 
mitogen IGF-1) is the most commonly-invoked mechanism to account for associations of a high GI/GL diet with 
increased cancer risk1. Insulin may also influence cancer development by altering sex hormone metabolism35. 
The differing associations of dietary GI and GL with different cancers probably reflect the fact that dietary GI is a 
measure of glucose availability and is independent of quantity, while dietary GL is a measure of the total glycemic 
effect, and is hence an indicator of the insulin demand of the diet. Thus, since a high GL diet is more likely than 
a high GI diet to produce chronically elevated blood glucose and insulin, cancer should depend more on dietary 
GL than dietary GI36. Our findings for DRCs fit this scenario: DRC risk was significantly related to high dietary 
GL and high carbohydrate intake from high GI foods, but not to high dietary GI. Similarly colon cancer risk was 
significantly associated with high GL and high carbohydrate intake from high GI foods, but also a high GI diet; by 
contrast high carbohydrate intake from low GI foods was associated with decreased colon cancer risk.
Strengths of our study are its large sample size, prospective design and complete follow-up. It is also notable 
for the fact that, compared to previous cohort studies, most GI values were determined specifically on local foods 
and are likely to be more accurate than values estimated from international food tables. Study limitations are 
first that the FFQs were not specifically designed to furnish dietary GI and GL, although they were designed to 
provide estimates of total carbohydrate and total energy intake. Second, we only have one dietary measurement 
and are unable to estimate long-term dietary intake, giving rise to some misclassification of exposure that would 
be expected to weaken associations between carbohydrate intake and cancer. Third, GI and GL estimates derived 
from FFQs may not take account of effects due to consuming mixed dishes, varying meal frequency, varying 
cooking methods, or chewing habits37 that can all influence the postprandial glycemic response. Strong correla-
tions between observed and calculated GI values for component foods in mixed meals were found in one study38; 
however another study found that predicted GIs were 22–50%. larger than directly measured GIs suggesting that 
and dietary GIs estimated from FFQs may be overestimates39.
Fourth, although we adjusted for several dietary and lifestyle factors that could confound the association 
between dietary GI/GL and cancer, residual confounding remains a possibility. It is also possible that unmeas-
ured or unknown factors may have caused confounding. Fifth, because of multiple comparisons, chance might 
have played a role in our findings although they are consistent with the findings of previous studies on the same 
cohort12, 13. Finally, we have no information on Helicobacter pylori infection and were thus unable to examine 
whether H pylori influenced associations between stomach cancer and dietary GI/GL; furthermore, the analyses 
for stomach cancer could not be stratified by subsite or histologic type because of the small numbers of cases.
To conclude, this Italian study on a Mediterranean population characterized by traditionally high and varied 
carbohydrate intake suggests that a high GI diet may increase risk of colon and bladder cancer, while a high GL 
diet may increase risk colon cancer and DRCs in general, but reduce risk of rectal cancer. Further prospective 
studies are needed to confirm the opposing effects of high dietary GL on risks of colon and rectal cancer.
Materials and Methods
Study population. 
EPIC is a large European study on diet and cancer. EPIC-Italy enrolled 47,749 adult vol-
unteers (men and women) at five centers: Varese and Turin in northern Italy, Florence in central Italy, and Naples 
and Ragusa in southern Italy40. The design, population, and baseline data collection methods of EPIC-Italy are 
described elsewhere40. Participants completed a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and a lifestyle questionnaire 
after signing an informed consent form. The lifestyle questionnaire solicited information on education, socioeco-
nomic status, occupation, history of previous illnesses and surgery, lifetime tobacco and alcohol use, and physical 
activity.
Participants lost to follow-up at baseline (n = 206) or who emigrated (n = 840) (zero follow-up); with missing 
information on diet (n = 874), anthropometry (n = 355) or lifestyle (n = 16); and with ratio of total energy intake 
(determined from the questionnaire) to basal metabolic rate at either extreme of the distribution (cut-offs first 
and last half-percentiles, n = 449) were excluded. Persons lost to baseline/emigrated had similar baseline charac-
teristics to study participants with full follow-up (data not shown). After a median follow-up of 14.9 years, 5112 
incident cancers and 2460 deaths were identified among study participants.
Ethics Statement. 
The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee at the Azienda Ospedaliera 
of Florence (Italy). At baseline, participants signed a written informed consent to use clinical data for research. 
Consent forms were stored with barcode ID for subject identification. The ethics committee approved this con-
sent procedure. The study protocol and informed consent procedure met the requirements of Italian legislation 
and the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975, as revised in 2008.
Dietary assessment. 
Dietary intake during the year before recruitment was assessed by validated FFQs41 
(separate ones for Naples, Ragusa, and Varese-Turin-Florence) designed to capture local eating habits. Detailed 
descriptions of the questionnaires are available elsewhere42. Nutrient values for all food items in the FFQs were

obtained from Italian food composition tables43. GIs for about 150 commercially available Italian foods and pre-
pared foods were obtained from published data44, while GIs from other foods are available from unpublished data 
(Brighenti F, University of Parma). If there was no analyzed food item sufficiently similar to a consumed item, GIs 
published elsewhere (International GI Tables45 and www.glycemicindex.com) were used. Detailed descriptions of 
the procedure for linking FFQ responses to GIs are given elsewhere46.
The average dietary GI of each participant was calculated as the sum of the GIs of each food item consumed, 
multiplied by the average daily amount consumed and the carbohydrate content (percentage), all divided by the 
total daily carbohydrate intake. Dietary GL was calculated similarly except that there was no division by total 
carbohydrate intake. Each unit of GL is equivalent to the blood glucose-raising effect of consuming 1 g of glucose.
We divided carbohydrate intake into that from high GI foods and that from low GI foods, adopting GI 57 as 
cut-off, such that high and low GI foods each contributed 50% of mean total carbohydrate intake in the EPIC-Italy 
cohort. The main sources of carbohydrate from high GI foods were bread, sugar/honey and jam, pizza, and 
refined rice; the main sources of carbohydrate from low GI foods were pasta and fruit.
Follow-up. 
In Varese, Turin, Florence and Ragusa, incident cancer cases were identified by linkage to regional 
cancer registries. In Naples, incident cases were identified through linkage to the regional archive of hospital dis-
charges, and by telephone enquiry where necessary. Participants were followed from study entry until first cancer 
diagnosis (except non-melanoma skin cancer), death, emigration, or end of follow-up, whichever occurred first. 
Follow-up ended December 31, 2010, in Florence, Turin, Ragusa and Naples; and December 31, 2009, in Varese. 
This difference was due to the fact that cancer registry and hospital discharge file availability for updating varied 
with recruitment center. Cancer cases were identified from the codes of the second edition of the International 
Classification of Diseases for Oncology. Only cancers with over 50 cases were included in cancer site-specific 
analyses for statistical power reasons. Diabetes-related cancers (DRCs) are cancers of bladder, breast, colon, rec-
tum, endometrium, liver, pancreas and prostate, as identified in the consensus report of the American Diabetes 
Association and the American Cancer Society20. Diabetes is associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer and 
increased risk of the other diabetes-related cancers20. We assessed associations of dietary carbohydrate with DRCs 
excluding prostate cancer. Data on vital status, cause and date of death were obtained from mortality databases. 
Causes of death were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision.
Statistical methods. 
Hazard ratios (HRs) of developing cancer in relation to quintiles of carbohydrate from 
high GI foods, carbohydrate from low GI foods, dietary GI and dietary GL were estimated by Cox multivar-
iate models stratified by FFQ (north-central Italy, Naples and Ragusa) to control for differences in question-
naire design. The quintiles were defined on the whole cohort and the variables were adjusted for total energy 
intake using the residual method47. In all models, age was the primary time variable. Sex, non-alcohol energy 
intake, smoking (never smoker/former smoker/current smoker), education (years of schooling), alcohol intake 
(abstainer, <12 g/day, ≥
12 g/day and ≥
24 g/day), BMI (<25, ≥
25 & <30, ≥
30), fiber intake (tertiles), saturated 
fat intake (g/day) and physical activity (quartiles of MET-hours) were included in the models as confounders.
The significance of linear trends was assessed by treating each quintile as a continuous variable in the model 
and performing the Wald test.
Sensitivity analyses were carried out, first by excluding persons diagnosed during the first six months of 
follow-up, second by excluding those with diabetes, and finally by excluding those who reported they were diet-
ing. The analyses were performed with STATA (version 14.0; Stata Corp, TX, USA).
