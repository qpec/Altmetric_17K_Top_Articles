BACKGROUND
In 2013, New York began requiring hospitals to follow protocols for the early 
identification and treatment of sepsis. However, there is controversy about whether 
more rapid treatment of sepsis improves outcomes in patients.
METHODS
We studied data from patients with sepsis and septic shock that were reported to 
the New York State Department of Health from April 1, 2014, to June 30, 2016. 
Patients had a sepsis protocol initiated within 6 hours after arrival in the emer-
gency department and had all items in a 3-hour bundle of care for patients with 
sepsis (i.e., blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotic agents, and lactate measure-
ment) completed within 12 hours. Multilevel models were used to assess the asso-
ciations between the time until completion of the 3-hour bundle and risk-adjusted 
mortality. We also examined the times to the administration of antibiotics and to 
the completion of an initial bolus of intravenous fluid.
RESULTS
Among 49,331 patients at 149 hospitals, 40,696 (82.5%) had the 3-hour bundle 
completed within 3 hours. The median time to completion of the 3-hour bundle 
was 1.30 hours (interquartile range, 0.65 to 2.35), the median time to the adminis-
tration of antibiotics was 0.95 hours (interquartile range, 0.35 to 1.95), and the 
median time to completion of the fluid bolus was 2.56 hours (interquartile range, 
1.33 to 4.20). Among patients who had the 3-hour bundle completed within 12 
hours, a longer time to the completion of the bundle was associated with higher 
risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 1.04 per hour; 95% confidence in-
terval [CI], 1.02 to 1.05; P<0.001), as was a longer time to the administration of 
antibiotics (odds ratio, 1.04 per hour; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.06; P<0.001) but not a 
longer time to the completion of a bolus of intravenous fluids (odds ratio, 1.01 per 
hour; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.02; P 
= 
0.21).
CONCLUSIONS
More rapid completion of a 3-hour bundle of sepsis care and rapid administration 
of antibiotics, but not rapid completion of an initial bolus of intravenous fluids, 
were associated with lower risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality. (Funded by the 
National Institutes of Health and others.)

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
M
ore than 1.5 million cases of sep-
sis occur in the United States annually, 
and many patients with sepsis present 
to the emergency department.1 International 
clinical practice guidelines and the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recom-
mend the prompt identification of sepsis and 
treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotic agents 
and intravenous fluids.2,3 These recommenda-
tions are supported by preclinical and observa-
tional studies suggesting that early treatment 
with antibiotics and intravenous fluids could re-
duce the number of avoidable deaths.4,5
Yet, considerable controversy exists about how 
rapidly sepsis must be treated.6 Some clinicians 
question the potential benefit of rapid treat-
ment, citing the absence of data from random-
ized trials, the potential for adverse effects, and 
the challenging implementation of these efforts 
in environments where staff are often over-
worked. Using data from New York,7 where hos-
pitals are required to implement protocols and 
report on the treatment of sepsis, we examined 
the association between the timing of treatment 
and risk-adjusted mortality.
Methods
Study Design and Population
In early 2013, the New York State Department of 
Health (NYSDOH) began requiring hospitals to 
submit and follow evidence-informed protocols 
for the early identification and treatment of severe 
sepsis or septic shock (New York Codes, Rules, 
and Regulations parts 405.2 and 405.4). Although 
protocols could be tailored by each hospital, all 
the protocols were required to include a 3-hour 
bundle consisting of receipt of the following 
care within 3 hours: obtaining of a blood culture 
before the administration of antibiotics, measure-
ment of the serum lactate level, and the admin-
istration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Protocols 
were also required to include a 6-hour bundle, 
consisting of the administration of a bolus of 
30 ml of intravenous fluids per kilogram of body 
weight in patients with hypotension or a serum 
lactate level of 4.0 mmol or more per liter, the 
initiation of vasopressors for refractory hypoten-
sion, and the remeasurement of the serum lactate 
level within 6 hours after the initiation of the 
protocol. Details about the treatment bundles 
are provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available with the full text of this ar-
ticle at NEJM.org.
We performed a retrospective study involving 
185 hospitals in the NYSDOH database, includ-
ing data from April 1, 2014, to June 30, 2016. All 
the hospitals were required to report patient-
level data for patients with sepsis and septic 
shock to the Department of Health using elec-
tronic case-report forms that included data on 
demographic characteristics, coexisting condi-
tions, characteristics of sepsis and septic shock, 
illness severity, and outcomes. Date and time 
stamps for protocol initiation and the elements 
of 3-hour and 6-hour bundled care were required 
for patients in whom a sepsis protocol was initi-
ated. The state performed audits on a 10% ran-
dom sample of hospitals using manual chart 
review and provided feedback to hospitals re-
garding data quality and completeness. Audit 
results are provided in Table S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix. Patient-level data were linked 
to hospital characteristics with the use of the 
NYSDOH administrative database. This study was 
approved with a waiver of informed consent by 
the NYSDOH institutional review boards.
Selection of Patients
Eligible encounters included those with patients 
who were older than 17 years of age and who 
had severe sepsis or septic shock, as defined 
with the use of criteria suggested in the 2001 
International Sepsis Definitions Conference 
(Sepsis-2).8 In order to study only patients with 
community-acquired sepsis, we focused on pa-
tients who had a sepsis protocol initiated in the 
emergency department within 6 hours after arrival 
at the hospital. To remove outliers, we excluded 
patients in whom the 3-hour bundle was com-
pleted more than 12 hours after the initiation of 
the protocol. We also excluded patients in whom 
bundled care could be clinically contraindicated, 
patients with advance directives that limited 
treatment, patients who declined interventions, 
and patients who were enrolled in a clinical trial. 
We excluded 36 hospitals that had fewer than 50 
cases of sepsis in order to remove spurious find-
ings in reliability-adjusted models.9
Hospitals varied in their sepsis-identification 
strategies (see the Methods section in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). These strategies included 
positive screening for sepsis on the basis of clini-
cal assessment only (suspected or confirmed

infection and two or more criteria for the sys-
temic inflammatory response syndrome, with 
supporting laboratory test results optional); posi-
tive screening based on both clinical criteria and 
abnormal laboratory values; and a “code sepsis 
or rapid response” strategy that led to a positive 
screening based on clinical criteria. The regula-
tions permitted hospitals to have flexibility with 
regard to case identification in order to facilitate 
broad adoption. Cases were not identified with 
the use of the Third International Consensus Defi-
nitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) 
because these definitions were released after the 
implementation of the regulations was under 
way,10 and it was not possible to use post hoc 
adjudication. More than 98% of the patients with 
data entered in the database were confirmed to 
have had severe sepsis or septic shock on manu-
al audit (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Cases that were found to have been entered 
erroneously could be removed by hospitals.
Variables
The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. 
The primary exposure was the time to comple-
tion of the 3-hour bundle, which was defined as 
the time in hours from the initiation of the 
protocol until all the elements of the 3-hour 
bundle were performed (i.e., blood cultures ob-
tained, broad-spectrum antibiotics administered, 
and serum lactate level measured). If any ele-
ment of the 3-hour bundle was performed before 
the start of the protocol, the patient was consid-
ered to have adhered to the protocol with regard 
to that element within the first hour. The time to 
the administration of broad-spectrum antibiot-
ics was defined in a similar fashion. The time to 
the completion of the initial bolus of intrave-
nous fluid was measured as the time from the 
initiation of the protocol until the completed 
administration of 30 ml of crystalloid fluid per 
kilogram, but only among patients who had a 
serum lactate level of 4.0 mmol or more per liter 
or who had hypotension (systolic blood pressure, 
<90 mm Hg).
Covariates included variables that were speci-
fied a priori as potential confounders between 
time to treatment and outcome on the basis of 
clinical experience and previous studies.10,11 These 
variables included demographic factors such as 
age, race or ethnic group, payer, burden of coex-
isting conditions, site of infection (e.g., respira-
tory, urinary, or skin), admission source (e.g., 
clinic, skilled nursing facility, or home), and 
measures of illness severity such as the presence 
of shock, serum lactate level, platelet count, or 
mechanical ventilation at admission. We devel-
oped a risk-adjustment model for in-hospital 
mortality using the above covariates with multi-
variable logistic regression that included a 90% 
random sample of the cohort. Internal validation 
of the model on the 10% remaining sample re-
vealed adequate calibration (Hosmer–Lemeshow 
goodness-of-fit test with group size of 150, 
P 
= 
0.97) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix) and discrimination (area under the receiver-
operating-characteristic curve [C statistic], 0.77).
Sensitivity Analyses
We assessed the robustness of our analyses by 
repeating the primary analysis using the time to 
treatment as measured from the earliest record-
ed time of the presentation in the emergency 
department.6 We also assessed models in pre-
specified subgroups of patients. We repeated 
models with the subgroup of patients who had a 
protocol initiated up to 24 hours after arrival in 
the emergency department and with the sub-
group of patients who had up to 24 hours be-
tween protocol initiation and completion of the 
3-hour bundle.12 We repeated models with pa-
tients who were discharged to hospice care clas-
sified as dead at discharge and models that ex-
cluded any patients who had an element of the 
3-hour bundle, administration of antibiotics, or 
completion of bolus of intravenous fluids before 
protocol initiation.
In supporting analyses, we measured the as-
sociation of other elements of the 3-hour bundle 
with mortality, including the time to obtaining 
of a blood culture and the time to serum lactate 
measurement. We performed quantitative bias 
analysis to assess the magnitude of a hypotheti-
cal, unmeasured confounder that would be nec-
essary to account for the association between 
the time to completion of the 3-hour bundle and 
risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality (see the Sup-
plementary Appendix).13
Statistical Analysis
We performed bivariate analyses of the charac-
teristics of the patients who had the 3-hour 
bundle in the emergency department completed 
within 3 hours and those who did not have the

3-hour bundle completed within that time win-
dow. Continuous data are expressed as means 
with standard deviations or as medians with 
interquartile ranges, depending on normality. 
Categorical variables are shown as proportions. 
The range and variability in the times to treat-
ments are shown with the use of histograms and 
cumulative proportions.
Multivariable modeling of the association be-
tween the time to treatment and in-hospital 
mortality was performed with the use of logistic 
regression, with adjustment for covariates. Bi-
nary variables were modeled as indicator covari-
ates, and continuous variables were included as 
linear covariates, after assessment for nonlinear 
relationships with the use of fractional polyno-
mials (P>0.05 for all models).14 We used multi-
level regression with a random effect of hospital 
to account for hospital-level clustering. Each ex-
posure (i.e., time to completion of the 3-hour 
bundle, time to the administration of broad-
spectrum antibiotics, and time to completion of 
initial bolus of intravenous fluids) was evaluated 
separately. The risk of in-hospital death across 
the range of time to treatment was generated for 
the “typical” patient with the use of predictive 
margins that were adjusted for an average of the 
independent variables, as appropriate. We show 
adjusted risk estimates that are derived from the 
nonlinear models in order to show changes in 
risk over time.14
We used empirical Bayesian methods to de-
termine the hospital-level rate of completion of 
the 3-hour bundle within 3 hours, administration 
of antibiotics within 3 hours, and completion of 
the initial bolus of intravenous fluids within 
6 hours.9 We show the ranked order of adjusted 
rates across hospitals in caterpillar plots. All the 
analyses were performed with the use of Stata 
software, version 14.2 (StataCorp).
Results
Population of Patients and Time to Treatment
Of 111,816 patients at 185 hospitals, we exclud-
ed 21,046 patients (18.8%) who were ineligible, 
32,665 (29.2%) who had protocols initiated out-
side the emergency department, 3648 (3.3%) 
who had protocols initiated after 6 hours, and 
5126 (4.6%) who did not have the 3-hour bundle 
completed within 12 hours (Fig. S1 and Table S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Of the remain-
ing 49,331 eligible patients in the emergency 
department at 149 hospitals, most (40,696 pa-
tients [82.5%]) had the 3-hour bundle completed 
within 3 hours.
The median time to the completion of the 
3-hour bundle was 1.30 hours (interquartile 
range, 0.65 to 2.35), the median time to the ad-
ministration of broad-spectrum antibiotics was 
0.95 hours (interquartile range, 0.35 to 1.95), 
and the median time to the completion of the 
initial bolus of intravenous fluids was 2.56 
hours (interquartile range, 1.33 to 4.20) (Fig. 1). 
The characteristics of the patients who had the 
3-hour bundle completed within 3 hours were 
similar to those who had the bundle completed 
during hours 3 through 12 (Table 1, and Table 
S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Primary Analyses
In a multivariable model, each hour of time to 
the completion of the 3-hour bundle was associ-
ated with higher mortality (odds ratio of death 
until completion of 3-hour bundle, 1.04 per 
hour; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.05; 
Figure 1. Cumulative Probability of Completion of  
the 3-Hour Bundle, Administration of Broad-Spectrum 
Antibiotics, and Completion of the Initial Intravenous-
Fluid Bolus after the Time That the Sepsis Protocol 
Was Initiated.
The 3-hour bundle for the care of patients with sepsis 
or septic shock had to include receipt of the following 
care within 3 hours: obtaining of a blood culture before 
the administration of antibiotics, measurement of the 
serum lactate level, and the administration of broad-
spectrum antibiotics; however, protocols could be tai-
lored by each hospital. We also assessed the time to 
the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and 
the time to the completion of an initial bolus of intra-
venous fluids.

in the Supplementary Appendix). Patients who 
received antibiotics in hours 3 through 12 had 
14% higher odds of in-hospital death than those 
who received antibiotics within 3 hours (odds 
ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.22; P 
= 
0.001). These 
associations appeared to be stronger among pa-
tients receiving vasopressors than among those 
who were not receiving vasopressors (Fig. 2, and 
Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Figure 3 
shows the crude and predicted risks of in-hospi-
tal death across a range of times to treatment in 
typical patients who presented to the emergency 
department. On average, the completion of the 
3-hour bundle at 6 hours was associated with 
mortality that was approximately 3 percentage 
points higher than the mortality associated with 
completion of the bundle within the first hour.
Among the 26,978 patients who were eligible 
for and had the bolus of intravenous fluids com-
pleted within 12 hours, the time to completion 
of the fluid bolus was not associated with in-
hospital mortality (odds ratio of death until fluid 
bolus was completed, 1.01 per hour; 95% CI, 
0.99 to 1.02; P 
= 
0.21) (Fig. S4 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Patients who had the initial 
fluid bolus completed during hours 6 through 
12 had an odds of in-hospital death that was 
similar to that among patients who had the ini-
tial fluid bolus completed within 6 hours (odds 
ratio of death for >6 hours to complete intra-
venous-fluid bolus, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.14; 
P 
= 
0.65). We found no interaction between time 
to the administration of antibiotics and time to 
completion of the initial bolus of intravenous 
fluids (P 
= 
0.88).

Time to Treatment and Mortality in Emergency Sepsis Care
tal deaths or when we excluded patients who had 
treatments completed before protocol initiation. 
When the time window for protocol initiation or 
completion of the 3-hour bundle was relaxed to 
24 hours, the association between completion of 
the bolus of intravenous fluids and mortality 
became significant, albeit of very small magni-
tude (odds ratio 1.001; 95% CI, 1.000 to 1.002; 
P 
= 
0.03). Details are provided in Table S6 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
In supporting analyses, we found that the 
time to obtaining a blood culture was associated 
with mortality (odds ratio, 1.04 per hour; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.06; P<0.001). Sim-
ilar findings were observed for each hour until 
serum lactate measurement (Figs. S5 and S6 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). The quantitative 
bias analysis indicated that our results would 
be robust unless an unmeasured confounder 
was at least twice as prevalent among patients 
who had the 3-hour bundle completed later as 
among those who had it completed 1 hour ear-
lier and unless the unmeasured confounder 
increased the odds of in-hospital death by more 
than 1.35 times (Fig. S7 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
The risk-adjusted and reliability-adjusted rates 
of completing the 3-hour bundle ranged from 53 
to 97% (median, 83%; interquartile range, 75 to 
88) (Fig. 4, and Fig. S8 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). After we ranked hospitals from the 
lowest to greatest likelihood of completing the 
3-hour bundle, the hospitals in the highest de-
cile, despite similar illness severity among their 
patients, were 1.5 times as likely to complete the 
3-hour bundle as hospitals in the lowest decile 
(94.3% vs. 64.1%). Hospitals that had a higher 
rate of bundle completion within 3 hours were 
somewhat smaller and less likely to be teaching 
hospitals than those that took longer than 3 
hours to complete the bundle (Table S7 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
Our findings support an association between 
time to treatment and outcome among patients 
with sepsis or septic shock treated in the emer-
gency department during a statewide initiative 
mandating protocolized care. We found that a 
longer time to completion of a 3-hour bundle of 
care for patients with sepsis and the administra-
tion of broad-spectrum antibiotics were each

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
associated with higher risk-adjusted in-hospital 
mortality. In our primary analysis, we did not 
find an association between the time to comple-
tion of the initial bolus of intravenous fluids and 
in-hospital mortality. The time to treatment 
varied widely across hospitals.
Our findings are consistent with multiple 
smaller, observational studies.5,15,16 A recent meta-
analysis of 11 observational studies, however, 
showed no significant mortality benefit of the 
administration of antibiotics within 3 hours, as 
compared with after 3 hours, after triage in the 
emergency department (odds ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 
0.92 to 1.46) or within 1 hour after the recogni-
tion of shock (odds ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 0.89 to 
2.40).6 The odds ratios we report are similar, but 
the confidence intervals are narrower given the 
much larger sample size that was included in 
our study.
This study complements a patient-level meta-
analysis of goal-directed therapy in severe sepsis 
and septic shock, the Protocolized Resuscitation 
in Sepsis Meta-Analysis (PRISM) trial.17 More 
than three of four patients in the PRISM trial 
received elements of the 3-hour bundle before 
randomization, after which the various trials 
composing the PRISM trial tested whether proto-
colized resuscitation strategies improved outcomes. 
Our study asked a different question: does timing 
matter for these earliest and most basic elements 
of care? These population-level data also place in 
context the relatively high compliance with these 
steps in the control groups of the various trials 
composing the PRISM trial before randomiza-
tion. Only half the hospitals in the statewide 
database performed near this level.
There are several biologic explanations for 
the association between the time to completion 
of a 3-hour treatment bundle and outcome. First, 
more rapid administration of antibiotics reduces 
pathogen burden, modifies the host response, 
and could reduce the incidence of subsequent 
organ dysfunction. Second, clinicians who de-
cide more quickly to measure the serum lactate 
level may identify heretofore unrecognized shock 
and are more prepared to deliver lactate-guided 
resuscitation than clinicians who are slower to 
measure the serum lactate level — a strategy 
that may improve outcome in randomized trials.18 
Third, physicians have broad variation in how 
they identify sepsis, even when they are pre-
sented with similar cases.19 Fast delivery of sep-
sis treatment, even within the structure of man-
dated protocols, requires a prompt clinical 
suspicion of both infection and worsening organ 
dysfunction.
Although we found no association between 
the time to completion of the initial bolus of 
intravenous fluids and outcome in our primary 
analysis, these data should not be interpreted 
as evidence in favor of abandoning early fluid 
resuscitation. The analysis of the time to com-
pletion of the initial fluid bolus is most prone to 
confounding by indication (e.g., sicker patients 
will receive fluids sooner and are also more 
likely to die).20 A greater volume of fluids given 
at rapid pace may also contribute to adverse ef-
fects such as pulmonary edema, volume over-
load, and longer duration of organ support in 
selected patients.21 Causal inference will require 
investigation in randomized clinical trials, and 
our analysis contributes to the clinical equipoise 
needed for such trials.
We found a variation of 1 to 2 times across 
hospitals with regard to the rates of completing 
the 3-hour bundle, the administration of anti-
biotics, and the completion of a bolus of intra-
Figure 4. Reliability-Adjusted Rate for Each Hospital for Completion  
of the 3-Hour Bundle in 3 Hours, According to Hospital Rank.
The 149 hospitals that were included in the study were ranked from lowest to 
highest, with higher numbers indicating a greater likelihood of completing 
the 3-hour bundle within 3 hours. I bars represent 95% confidence intervals.

Time to Treatment and Mortality in Emergency Sepsis Care
venous fluids in the emergency department. Ad-
herence, in general, ranged from 60 to 90%, and 
was greater than in comparable quality-improve-
ment programs for stroke treatment in New 
York.22 Such performance may stem from in-
creasing public awareness and advocacy about 
sepsis and national quality-improvement initia-
tives led by CMS.23 Adherence was greatest in the 
emergency departments at smaller nonteaching 
hospitals, a finding that differs from a previous 
cohort study.24 These hospitals may have fewer 
clinicians to train, a lower census in the emer-
gency department, and a different case mix as 
compared with larger referral centers, which 
perhaps facilitates the more rapid implementa-
tion of sepsis protocols.
Our study has several limitations. First, this 
was not a randomized trial, so the results may 
be biased by confounding. Of greatest concern 
may be the lack of data about the appropriate-
ness of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The appro-
priateness of the initial choice of an antibiotic 
agent has been associated with risk-adjusted mor-
tality25 but may be measurable only in the minor-
ity of patients with positive cultures and may 
differ according to local pathogen and anti-
microbial resistance profiles. The hospitals in-
cluded in this study were limited to a single state 
that may have epidemiologic features of sepsis 
that are distinct from those in other geographic 
regions.26 The start time for measuring delays 
may not be accurate in all cases. To address this, 
we evaluated models that used the earliest time 
of arrival in the emergency department and 
found no change in associations.
Our statewide evaluation showed that the 
times to the completion of a 3-hour bundle and 
the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics 
were associated with greater in-hospital mortal-
ity among patients with severe sepsis and septic 
shock in the emergency department. We found 
no association between the time to completion 
of the initial bolus of intravenous fluids and 
outcome. If the relationship is causal, prompt 
recognition and faster treatment of sepsis and 
septic shock in the context of emergency care 
may reduce the incidence of avoidable deaths.
