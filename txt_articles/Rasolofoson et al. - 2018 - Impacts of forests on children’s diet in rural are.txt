27 developing countries

Micronutrient deficiency affects about a third of the world’s population. Children in developing countries are par-
ticularly vulnerable. Consequences include impaired cognitive and physical development and increased childhood
morbidity and mortality. Recent studies suggest that forests help alleviate micronutrient deficiency by increasing
dietary diversity. However, evidence is mostly based on weakly designed local case studies of limited relevance to
global policies. Furthermore, impacts of forests on diet vary among communities, and understanding this variation
can help target actions to enhance impact. We compile data on children’s diets in over 43,000 households across
27 developing countries to examine the impacts of forests on dietary diversity. We use empirical designs that are
attentive to assumptions necessary for causal interpretations and that adequately account for confounding
factors that could mask or mimic the impact. We find that high exposure to forests causes children to have at least
25% greater dietary diversity compared to lack of exposure, a result comparable to the impacts of some nutrition-
sensitive agricultural programs. A closer look at a subset of African countries indicates that impacts are generally
higher for less developed communities, but highest with certain access to markets, roads, and education. Our results
also indicate that forests could help reduce vitamin A and iron deficiencies. Our study establishes the causal relation-
ship between forests and diet and thus strengthens the evidence for integrating forest conservation and manage-
ment into nutrition interventions. Our results also suggest that providing households some access to capital can
increase the impact of forest-related interventions on nutrition.
INTRODUCTION
Deficiencies in micronutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, are one
of the world’s major nutritional challenges, affecting over 2 billion
people worldwide (1). Often symptomless, and thus unnoticed, they
nevertheless have important health consequences such as reduced
cognitive and physical development, capacity and productivity, and
increased childhood morbidity and mortality. Children are particu-
larly vulnerable, and micronutrient deficiency is more prevalent in
developing countries (2). Interventions to tackle the problem range
from micronutrient supplementation to agricultural programs aimed
at combating lack of food and dietary diversity (2). The potential role
of forests in diversifying diethas led to recent calls for the reassessment
of forest conservation and management in nutrition policies and for
making forest-related interventions more nutrition-sensitive (3–5).
Forests affect dietary diversity through diverse pathways (Fig. 1).
Forest food products, including diverse animal, plant, and mushroom
species, are commonly collected by rural forest people in developing
countries (5). While forest foods do not universally form a substan-
tial part of a diet, they supply essential micronutrients and contribute
significantly to nutrition in some contexts (6). For example, in rural
forest-dependent households in Cameroon, forest foods contribute
93% of women’s vitamin A intake, 100% for sodium, 85% for iron,
88% for zinc, and 89% for calcium (7). Forests shelter pollinators
upon which over 70% of leading global crops depend, representing
35% of the food supply (8). Pollination is crucial for the production
of fruits and vegetables that are sources of essential micronutrients (9)
and improve cropquality and quantity. For example, an experiment by
Klatt et al. (10) shows that bee-pollinated strawberries have improved
quality and quantity compared to wind-pollinated and self-pollinated
strawberries. Access to forest products (timber and nontimber) can
affect dietary diversity through increased income and disposable time.
A study covering 24 developing countries found that, on average, for-
est products contribute 22% of total income (subsistence and cash) of
rural forest households (11). Part of the forest income is sold for cash
(11), which can be used to buy foods or inputs for agricultural produc-
tion. Proximity to forest products (for example, firewood) can also af-
fect the time women allocate to nutrition-related activities, such as
food preparation or agricultural production (12). In Nepal, de-
forestation was associated with an average increase of 1.13 hours in
the time women daily spent to collect fuelwood, leaf fodder, and grass
for livestock feed (13). Finally, there are also suggestions that agricul-
tural techniques in forested areas often involve diverse crops that may
be conducive to a more diverse diet (14).
To efficiently integrate forest management into nutrition policies,
strong evidence about impacts of forests on diets is needed. However,
few studies have explored the relationships between forests and dietary
diversity. Further, with the exceptions of the studies of Ickowitz et al.
(14) and Galway et al. (15), these studies focus on a specific location or
country [for example, (12, 16)]. While they generally suggest positive
relationships between forests and dietary diversity, the specific spatial
focus of these studies renders difficult the applicabilityof their findings
to global policies.
Those existing studies generate evidence based on point estimates
(for example, regression coefficients) of the magnitude of the relation-
ships between forests, dietary diversity, and other correlates of dietary
diversity, but causal interpretations are difficult. The assumptions nec-
essary for point estimates are strong and not often tested or dealt with
in a transparent manner, reducing the credibility of these estimates

 (17, 18). Credibility can be greatly improved by moving away from a
focus on controlling for simple correlates of dietary diversity to a sys-
tematic account and control for confounding factors that affect both
forest location and dietary diversity. These confounders are the
sources of systematic bias in the estimators of impact (18). Therefore,
existing studies on the relationships between forests and dietary diver-
sity generate important hypotheses that still need to be tested to make
clear conclusions about causal impacts.
Heterogeneity of impacts, that is, howdifferent communities ordif-
ferent groups within a community are affected by natural systems (for
example, forests), is not well covered in the empirical literature linking
natural systems and human health (19). The ecological transition the-
ory posits that poorer people rely to a greater extent on natural systems
(for example, forests) for the provisioning of services important to
health (for example, food) (19).Poorerpeople are therefore more likely
to be affected by natural systems. As communities become more de-
veloped, they tend to substitute natural capital with other types of cap-
ital (for example, physical capitals: roads and markets; human capital:
education) for the provisioning of these services.
Therefore, level of development and access to markets, roads, and
education are potential variables moderating the impact of forests on
dietary diversity. Greater access to markets and roads can reduce
dependence on forests and, thus, the impact of forests on diet. Markets
provide an alternative source of food. Roads promote access to exter-
nal food products. Markets and roads can also open opportunities for
non–forest-related source of income that is used to buy food. However,
markets and roads can also increase the impact of forests on dietary
diversity. They can facilitate the exploitation or transformation of for-
est benefits into more diverse food, including through cash income.
Higher levels of education can allow households to better exploit and
transform forest benefits into more diverse food, particularly as more
educated parents are more diet-conscious and, thus, are more likely to
provide higher-quality food to their children (20). Understanding these
moderating variables could shed light on who is likely to gain or lose
from integration of forests and nutrition policies, where to invest in
such integration to maximize impacts, and how to enhance impacts
of forests on dietary diversity through development actions or actions
on access to markets, roads, and education.
We examine the impacts of forests on dietary diversity in rural
areas of developing countries. We contribute to the literature in sev-
eral ways. First, we expand the spatial scope to 27 countries across
four continents (Fig. 2). Second, we pay close attention to the as-
sumptions necessary for causal interpretations, so that our empirical
designs yield credible estimates of impacts. Finally, we examine how
impacts vary as a function of development and access to markets,
roads, and education. Through these contributions, our study pro-
vides an important step toward strengthening the evidence for inte-
grating forest conservation and management into the list of nutrition
interventions.
Dietary diversity
We measure dietary diversity using the individual dietary diversity
score (IDDS) developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations (21). IDDS is a simple count of food groups
an individual has consumed over a 24-hour period and a standard
measure of the quality, particularly micronutrient adequacy, of the
diet (22). Our IDDS ranges from 0 (the child did not eat any food
item of any of the food group) to 10 (the child ate at least 1 food item
of each of 10 food groups) (Materials and Methods).
IDDS gives equal weight to each food group. Thus, it may overlook
food groups that provide key micronutrients. Given the health con-
sequences of and high number of people affected by vitamin A and
iron deficiencies in developing countries (1), we look at whether chil-
dren within a household have consumed vitamin A– or iron-rich food
items over a 24-hour period (see Materials and Methods for the def-
inition of vitamin A– and iron-rich food).
Exposure to forest
Following the United Nations Environment Programme definition of
closed forests, we designate as forest an area with a minimum of 40%
tree cover (23). We define forest households (that is, with high exposure
to forest) as those living in communities located within 3 km from for-
est edges and with at least 30% of the area within 5-km buffer around
the community centers covered by forests. Nonforest households (that
is, lacking exposure to forest) are those farther than 8 km from forest
edges (Materials and Methods).

 Definition of impact
We define impact of high exposure to forest as the difference between
the average dietary diversity offorest households and the averagecoun-
terfactual dietary diversity for these same forest households had there
been no nearby forest [formally, the average treatment effect on the
treated (ATT; Materials and Methods)]. The former is the observed
mean dietary diversity of the forest households, but the latter (the
counterfactual) is unobserved. Hence, we must assume that the mean
dietary diversity of some of the nonforest households represents the
average counterfactual dietary diversity for forest households had they
not had access to forests. The credibility of the impactestimatedepends
on the plausibility of the assumptions we make when identifying this
counterfactual. Precise point estimates of impacts often require strong
assumptions about counterfactual outcomes, which can diminish their
credibility (17). We use various estimationstrategies with varying levels
of assumptions to both bound and calculate point estimates of impacts.
Concerning vitamin A– or iron-rich food consumption, impact of
high exposure to forest is the difference between the percentages of
forest households where children ate vitamin A– or iron-rich food
and the counterfactuals of these percentages had forest households
lacked exposure to forest.
RESULTS
Estimates of impacts of forests on dietary diversity
We start with a partial identification approach (24), which allows us to
place the estimate of impact within a credible range without invoking
strong and opaque assumptions, including those about the baseline
dietary diversity, which is missing as each household was surveyed
only once. The mean dietary diversity for forest households across the
27 countries is 3.12. Without making any assumptions, we know that
the counterfactual dietary diversity cannot be higher than 10 (the high-
est possible IDDS) or lower than 0 (the lowest possible IDDS). We thus
define the impact estimate to be within a range delimited by a lower
bound of 3.12 − 10 = −6.89 and an upper bound of 3.12 − 0 = 3.12.
To narrow the range of impact estimates, we invoke the weak and
plausible assumption (formally, the Monotone Treatment Selection
Assumption) that, without forest, forest households would have
counterfactual average dietary diversity no higher than the average
dietary diversity of the nonforest households (2.50). This assumption
is plausible given that remaining forests are often “selected” toward re-
mote and difficult access lands, away from markets and infrastructure,
with lower agricultural potential, and where households are more so-
cially disadvantaged than in nonforested areas (25)—facts that are gen-
erally supported in our data (Table 1). Hence, we move the lower bound
from 3.12 − 10 = −6.89 to 3.12 − 2.50 = 0.62. We thus refine the impact
estimate to be within the range of 0.62 to 3.12 (Fig. 3).
We also apply similar partial identification approach to a subset of
14 sub-Saharan African countries that are the focus of further analyses
and estimate impact for these countries to be within the range of 0.36
to 2.81 (Fig. 3).
To generate a precise point estimate of impact, we use statistical
matching. Matching controls for observed confounding variables by
selecting nonforest households that are similar to forest households
in terms of these variables (see Materials and Methods for more on
confounders). After matching, we invoke the strong assumption that
the average dietary diversity of the matched nonforest households rep-
resents the average counterfactual dietary diversity for forest house-
holds [formally, the Conditional Mean Independence Assumption
(CMIA; Materials and Methods)]. We restrict the use of matching
to 14 sub-Saharan African countries because the CMIA is more likely
to be plausible for this subset of countries than for all 27 countries
(Materials and Methods). The average difference between the dietary
diversity of forest and the matched nonforest households is 0.4
(95% confidence interval, 0.29 to 0.51; Fig. 3).
Further, the CMIA is plausible if there are no unobserved con-
founders or if they are sufficiently correlated with and thus captured
by the observed ones (18). We indirectly test this assumption with
the placebo test (26). We define the matched nonforest households
from the primary analysis as placebo households. We then match
these placebo households to other nonforest households using the
same matching and postmatching procedures. After matching, both
the placebo and their matched households have similar observed con-
founders and both have no forests. Therefore, we should not observe

 large differences between the dietary diversity of the placebo and their
matched households if unobserved confounders are captured by the
observed confounders. We detect a small average difference (−0.04)
that is statistically insignificant (95% confidence interval, −0.17 to
0.09; Fig. 3), supporting the adequacy of our empirical design.
Heterogeneity of impacts of forests on dietary diversity
The ecological transition theory (19) postulates that poorer commu-
nities are more affected by forests than richer communities. To ex-
amine this postulate, we assess how impact (difference in dietary
diversity between forest and counterfactual households) varies with
the gridded gross domestic product (GDP) of the areas where com-
munities are located (gridded GDP, that is, different grids within a
country have different GDP values to allow variation within the
country; see table S1 for scales of data). GDP is a standard measure
of community economic development. Our results suggest that im-
pacts are significantly positive in poor communities (with a peak of
about 0.63 at the community GDP of US$0.7 billion), become statis-
tically insignificant between the community GDP of US$3 billion
and 5 billion, and then significantly negative above the community
GDP of US$5 billion (Fig. 4A).
Further, we estimate the specific moderating effects of access to
markets, roads, and education on impacts of forests on dietary diver-
sity. The moderating effects of access to market (proxied by distance to
the nearest urban town) and access to road (proxied by distance to the
nearest road) have similar trends (Fig. 4, B and C). At low distances,
the impact of forests on dietary diversity is significantly positive and
then becomes statistically insignificant at larger distances. However,
while the effect of forests seems to peak at a distance of 15 km from
the nearest town (with a maximum of 0.62), forest effects steadily de-
crease with increasing distance to the nearest road (with a maximum
of around 0.5 at 0 km). The impact of forests on dietary diversity in-
creases markedly with increasing education of heads of households. At
low education levels (0 to 1 year), effects are small and statistically in-
significant but increase steadily, become significant, and exceed 1.0 at
15 years of education (Fig. 4D).
Estimates of impacts of forests on vitamin A– and iron-rich
food consumption
Using a partial identification approach (Materials and Methods), we
find that highexposure toforest increases the prevalence of households
where children ate vitamin A– or iron-rich food by at least (lower-
bound estimates) 11 and 16 percent points, respectively (Fig. 5).

 DISCUSSION
Our results indicate that greater exposure to forests, on average, has pos-
itive effects on children’s dietary diversity in developing countries. Even
our most conservative estimates (that is, the lower bounds of the esti-
mates from partial identification) detect significantly positive impacts.
However, while our average estimates of impacts are significantly pos-
itive, impacts are heterogeneous across different communities or
households. Impacts generally appear positive and greater in commu-
nities with lower level of development but seem to be greatest at mod-
erate (not lowest) development levels. Greater access to markets, roads,
and education generally improvesimpactsof forestson dietary diversity.
Our results confirm the generally positive relationship between
forests and dietary diversity in the literature (12, 14–16). Our results
strengthen the credibility of this evidence base because the assump-
tions embedded with our empirical design are weak, plausible, and
transparently examined. When we invoke a strong assumption to gen-
erate a point estimate, we still detect significantly positive impact, on
average. Our point estimate falls within the range of estimates based
on weak and plausible assumptions, and our placebo test yields small
and statistically insignificant results, lending support to the point es-
timate’s credibility.
Comparisons with studies on well-known agricultural interven-
tions aiming to improve micronutrient nutrition put our results into
perspective. A study in Mozambique (27) suggests that a program on
biofortification of orange-fleshed sweet potato added 0.66 to the di-
etary diversity score of intervention children relative to control chil-
dren (that is, 20% of the average dietary diversity of control children).
In Cambodia, estimates of impacts of a homestead food production
program vary between −0.4 and 0.3 (that is, −10 and 7% of the average
dietary diversity of control children) (28). These studies are not di-
rectly comparable to ours because of differences in spatial scale and
design among other factors. However, even our lower-bound estimates
are comparable to their results, indicating that forest conservation and
management could have a role in the portfolio of interventions tar-
geted to fight micronutrient deficiency.
Our results support the ecological transition theory (19) and rein-
force a large body of the literature (3, 4), showing higher impacts of
forests on diet in communities with lower level of development. We
found the highest impacts at low, but not the lowest, levels of devel-
opment (Fig. 4A), perhaps because a certain level of capital is needed
to enhance impacts. This interpretation is supported by the specific
moderating effects of access to markets and roads (physical capitals)
and education level of heads of households (human capital). Lowest
levels of capitals (largest distances to a market and road and lowest
levels of education) appear to make impacts of forests on diet small
and not statistically significant. Higher levels of capitals (nearer to a
market and road and higher levels of education) seem to render impacts

 positive, larger, and statistically significant. It looks though that impacts
need a certain distance to a market (an urban town) to be maximized,
probably because opportunities for non–forest-related and off-farm
sources of income make communities in the immediate vicinity of
towns less dependent on forest-related food and income.
Vitamin A deficiency is strongly linked with child mortality via a
suite of pathways (29), one of which, diarrheal disease, is the second
leading cause of child mortality across the globe (30). A recent com-
prehensive review of vitamin A deficiency and child mortality (29)
states that although the exact mechanism is not fully understood,
the effect that adequate intake of vitamin A has on child mortality
is most likely related to reduction in the frequency and severity of
diarrhea and measles. Given our resultant link between vitamin A
and forest cover, interventions aimed at reducing childhood vitamin
A deficiency in some of the poorest parts of the world (for example,
biofortification, supplementation) might consider the role forests
could play in delivering effective outcomes, particularly in places
where implementation of these interventions is difficult.
We do not have data on and could not control for household in-
come, an important confounder that can bias our point estimator of
impact. We do not use the household wealth variable in our data set as
a proxy for income because while the wealth variable is a correlate of
dietary diversity, it is likely to be a mechanism through which forests
affect diet rather than a confounder. Thus, controlling for the wealth
variable would block the impact of forests on diet that occurs through
this mechanism (see section S1). Therefore, we use other variables that
are commonly used to proxy household income for targeting social
programs but could not be affected by forest cover at the time of the
survey and thus are unlikely to be mechanisms. The result of the pla-
cebo test provides some support that these proxy variables together
with the other confounders capture the unobserved income variable.
Our large-scale study is important in describing broad patterns of
impacts of forests on dietary diversity. However, interpretation and
application of our results to finer-scale contexts should be done with
caution. For example, we use the threshold of 40% canopy cover to
define forests. While the threshold is recommended for global analy-
sis, it is unlikely to satisfy national or regional definitions of forests
(23). Finer-scale applications will thus benefit from data more sensi-
tive to finer-scale contexts. Application of the partial identification ap-
proach to our data allows us to define ranges of impact estimates that
are positive. However, the ranges are still quite wide. Time series data
gathered on forest and nonforest households could make ranges of
estimates more precise (31). As for the point estimate, the placebo test
result indirectly supports the ability of our empirical design to capture
unobserved sources of bias, but it cannot rule them out. Time series
data gathered on forest and nonforest households combined with the
matching design we used here could yield stronger evidence by elim-
inating all time invariant sources of bias (32).
Our results demonstrate the potential links between policies tar-
geting forest conservation and nutrition. In particular, so-called
“nutrition-sensitive interventions” address the underlying determi-
nants of undernutrition and incorporate specific nutrition goals and
actions to achieve them [for example, agriculture, social safety nets
(20)]. Given that forests improve dietary diversity, which is an under-
lying determinant of undernutrition (20), forest conservation is a
potential nutrition-sensitive intervention. By collaborating more
closely, conservation and public health scholars and practitioners
can better incorporate nutrition goals into forest conservation efforts
and design and effectively implement actions to achieve these goals.
Our study suggests that a certain level of access to capital such as
roads, markets, and education can enhance the impact of forest con-
servation on dietary diversity and thus help achieve nutrition goals.
Other studies point to the need to strengthen community access to
physical capitals [for example, transport infrastructure, market, stor-
age facilities (3, 33)], social capital [for example, community associa-
tions (3)], and human capital [for example, education (4)] as a way to
optimize forest nutritional benefits. Therefore, a mix of natural, built,
social, and human capital is likely to augment nutritional benefits of
forests. However, care is needed as some capitals(for example, markets
and roads) are also drivers of deforestation (34) and can thus imperil
forest resources important to nutrition.
To conclude, conventional means to tackle undernutrition have
focused on increasing the production of staple food. While increased
staple food production addresses the energy needs of a growing global
population, it has resulted in the simplification of diets, leading to con-
sumption of less diverse and more nutritionally poor foods (35). Con-
sequently, there is an emerging emphasis on making food programs
more nutrition-sensitive (20). On the basis of rigorous empirical de-
signs, our results indicate that forest conservation and management
could be part of nutrition-sensitive programs. Greater exposure to
forests has led to more diverse diets in rural children in developing
countries, and the magnitude of the impacts is at least comparable
to other nutrition-sensitive agricultural interventions. Improving the
nutrition sensitivity of forest conservation and management interven-
tions can particularly enhance the nutrition of vulnerable communities.
Pairing these interventions with measures that increase communities’
access to capital can further enhance the nutrition benefits of forests. In
addition to their roles in supporting livelihoods of local communities
and biodiversity, mitigating climate change, and other benefits, we
present strong evidence that forests contribute to human health
through their roles in micronutrient nutrition.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Dietary diversity
We constructed our dietary diversity measure—IDDS—based on diet
information of children younger than 5 years collected through the
Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program administered by
the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The DHS
program collected nationally representative data on population demog-
raphy, health, and nutrition in over 90 countries. We compiled data
from DHS across 27 developing countries in Africa, Central and South
America, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe (Fig. 2) and collected in
different years between 2000 and 2013.
To create the outcome variable, IDDS, we followed the food group-
ing recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (21) comprising 14 food groups: cereals; vitamin A–
rich vegetables and tubers; white roots and tubers; dark green leafy
vegetables; other vegetables; vitamin A–rich fruits; other fruits; organ
meat; flesh meat; eggs; fish; legumes, nuts, and seeds; milk and milk
products; and oils and fats. We reduced the food groups to 10. We
combined other vegetables and other fruits into one group because
many DHS do not disaggregate these two food groups. Similarly, we
grouped organ meat, flesh meat, and fish into one group. We also re-
moved oils and fats, as many DHS do not have information on this
food group. For a given food group, we assigned a score of 1 if a child’s
diet over the previous 24 hours included at least one food item

 belonging to that group and 0 otherwise. We then summed these
values over all food groups to create the IDDS. We averaged the IDDS
of children within a household, as the unit of analysis is a household.
We defined vitamin A– and iron-rich food following the guidelines
of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (21).
Vitamin A–rich food items are those in the following food groups:
vitamin A–rich vegetables and tubers, dark green leafy vegetables, and
vitamin A–rich fruits. Iron-rich food items are those included in the
combined organ meat, flesh meat, and fish food group.
Exposure to forest
Our forest cover data came from the global MODIS Vegetation Con-
tinuous Field products. These products are yearly (2000 to 2010) rep-
resentations of the Earth’s surface in terms of percent tree cover at
250-m spatial resolution (36).
The communities surveyed by DHS (referred as “clusters” in DHS
documentation) were georeferenced. We were thus able to integrate
the DHS data with the forest cover and the spatial confounder data.
We associated each household in the surveys with the forest cover of
the year of the survey, except for the 2011–2013 surveys, for which we
used the 2010 forest cover. We selected 3 km within forest edges as a
criterion to define forest households because, on average, people in
rural developing countries walk about 35 min to come to the closest
forest to collect forest products (5). Using the rule of thumb that a
person walks about 5 km in an hour, a 35-min walk is about 3-km
distance. In addition, pollinators, which are one mechanism through
which forests may affect diet (Fig. 1), generally forage within 3 km of
nest sites (37, 38). The other criterion that forest covers at least 30% of
the area within 5-km buffer of communities is based on studies sug-
gesting that natural forest habitats need to cover at least 30% of a given
area to maintain pollination services (39). We used 5-km buffer be-
cause the locations of communities in DHS were randomly displaced
up to 5 km to protect anonymity of survey respondents. Moreover,
because of this displacement, communities located between 3 and 8 km
from forest edges could actually be within 3 km of forest edges and thus
forest households. Given this uncertainty, we excluded households of
communities located between 3 and 8 km from forest edges. We also re-
moved urban communities from our analyses, as forests are mainly lo-
cated in rural areas. Last, we excluded children under 12 months old, as
their diet is dominated by breast milk, particularly in low- and lower
middle–income countries (40). Our final data set comprised 43,011
households (11,338 forest households and 31,673 nonforest households).
Confounding characteristics
We identified both site and household level confounders. Forest cover
is a site characteristic and, thus, relevant confounders are site charac-
teristics affecting both forest cover and diet. However, households also
self-selected themselves whether to migrate or stay in or out forested
areas. Therefore, household characteristics that influence both where
households choose to live and diet are also relevant confounders. Here,
we presented the rationale for choosing each confounder. Fuller de-
scription and data sources of the confounding variables are in table S1.
Site characteristics
Variables related to returns to agriculture. Confounding site char-
acteristics include site variables related to returns to agriculture be-
cause of the major role of agriculture in both forest land conversion
(41) and food availability worldwide.
Returns to agriculture are higher for lands with higher agricultural
potential and more easily accessed. Therefore, we controlled for varia-
bles that capture land agriculture potential (agriculture suitability,
slope, and elevation) and access (distance to a road or a city). In addi-
tion to its effects on returns to agriculture, access also influences the
availability of marketed food.
Livestock production. Livestock production is one of the major driv-
ers of deforestation, including through expansion of pasture lands
(42). It contributes to human diet by providing animal-based food.
Intensive livestock production can also reduce human dietary diversi-
ty by promoting monoculture of crops that can be used for both
animal feed and human food (43). We used the variable ruminant
livestock density to control for livestock production.
Development. Development is linked to forest cover, particularly
deforestation, through complex pathways (43, 44). Development has
also been linked to health-related outcomes, including nutrition. Low-
and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia
have higher prevalence of childhood undernutrition than any other
regions on the globe, with 42% of children younger than 5 years in East
Africa being stunted (2). To control for development, we used GDP of
the areas where communities are located. The community GDP was
converted to U.S. dollars using purchasing power parity factor to ad-
just for spatial and temporal variations across communities.
Population. Larger population triggers more deforestation by
putting more pressure on forest resources (44). Increasing population
size can render an area more attractive to market and thus provide
access to marketed food (45). We controlled for population size.
Household characteristics
Education. Level of education affects one’s decision to migrate (46).
Parents’ education also influences children’s nutrition (20). Thus, we
controlled for the levels of education of heads of households.
Proxies for income. Income or wealth is suggested to determine mi-
gration (47). Greater income is also associated with improved nutrition
(48). The DHS data do not have information on household income. We
controlled for a combination of variables that are among those widely
used to proxy household income for targeting social programs, namely,
education and age of heads of households, household size, and number
of children younger than 5 years in a household (49).
Statistical analysis
ATT, CMIA, and matching
The potential outcome model of causal inference (50) posits that each
household in our population has two potential dietary diversity out-
comes: the dietary diversity under high exposure to forest, Yi(1), and
the dietary diversity under lack of exposure to forest, Yi(0). The causal
effect of high exposure to forest for a particular household can be
defined as the difference between these two potential outcomes
di ¼ Yið1Þ � Yið0Þ
ð1Þ
The challenge is that, for a household i at a given moment, we can
observe either Yi(1) orYi(0) but notboth. The unobservedpotentialout-
come is called counterfactual outcome.
At the population level, we can define the ATT (here, treatment is
high exposure to forest)
ATT ¼ E½Yið1Þ � Yið0ÞjDi ¼ 1�
¼ E½Yið1ÞjDi ¼ 1� � E½Yið0ÞjDi ¼ 1�
ð2Þ
where E[.] is the expectation operator from probability theory and
|Di = 1 means conditional on the household being under high exposure

 to forest (that is, being forest household). In other words, the ATT is the
difference between the expected dietary diversity of forest households
under high exposure to forest, E[Yi(1)|Di = 1], and the expected dietary
diversity of these same forest households were they under lack of expo-
sure to forest, E[Yi(0)|Di = 1]. The former, which is the average dietary
diversity of forest households, is observed. The latter, which is the die-
tary diversity of forest households, had they not been exposed to forest,
is unobserved (the counterfactual).
The CMIA postulates that, conditional on comparable observed
confounders, X, between forest and nonforest households, the expected
dietary diversity of the nonforest households under lack of exposure to
forest, E[Yi(0)|Di = 0], represents the unobserved counterfactualaverage
dietary diversity, E[Yi(0)|Di = 1]
E½Yið0ÞjDi ¼ 1; X� ¼ E½Yið0ÞjDi ¼ 0; X� ¼ E½Yið0ÞjX�
ð3Þ
In other words, the expected dietary diversity under lack of exposure
to forest, E[Yi(0)], for households with similar characteristics is
independent of the causal states, that is, whether the households are un-
der high (Di = 1) or lack of (Di = 0) exposure to forest. Matching seeks to
satisfy the CMIA by processing the data such that the resulting post-
matching set of data achieves balance across key confounders, X, be-
tween the forest and nonforest households. In principle, if outcomes
(IDDS) and exposure to forest are determined by observable confound-
ers (X), then postmatching balance across X allows for identification of
the ATT via difference in means between forest and nonforest
households. We restricted the use of matching to 14 sub-Saharan Afri-
can countries where we achieved a reasonable level of postmatching bal-
ance on the observed confounders (table S2). Equally important, we
adjusted for the remaining postmatching imbalance with the post-
matching linear regression bias correction of Abadie and Imbens
(51). We performed one-to-one matching with replacement using the
multivariate Mahalanobis distance measure. We executed exact
matching on country. We used the R “matching” package (52).
Heterogeneity of impacts
To examine the variation of impact with community GDP, we plotted
impact (forest household IDDS − counterfactual IDDS) against com-
munity GDP using a nonparametric locally weighted scatter plot
smoothing (LOESS). LOESS enabled us to analyze the relationship be-
tween impact and community GDP without controlling for other varia-
bles that correlated with community GDP. We allowed other variables
to change with community GDP, as we are interested in how poor and
rich communities fare rather than the isolated effect of the community
GDP variable.
Distance to an urban town (with at least 5000 inhabitants), distance
to a road, and education level of heads of households are potential mod-
erators of impacts. We are therefore interested in their isolated moder-
ating effects, net of the effects of the other variables. To isolate their
moderating effects, we used a semiparametric partial linear differencing
model (PLM) (53). PLM linearly controls for other confounders before
calling LOESS to estimate impact as a function of the moderators.
Hence, PLM estimates the impact of forests on dietary diversity as a
function of the mediators while holding constant the other confounders.
Partial identification of impacts of forests on vitamin A– and
iron-rich food consumption
The percentages of forest households where all children ate vitamin A–
or iron-rich food are 73 and 47%, respectively. Without making any as-
sumptions, the counterfactual percentages must be between 100% (all
children of all households ate vitamin A– or iron-rich food) and 0%
(all households have children who did not eat any vitamin A– or iron-
rich food). Therefore, we bounded the impact estimate to be between
73 − 100 = −27% and 73 − 0 = 73% for vitamin A, and between 47 −
100 = −53% and 47 − 0 = 47% for iron.
Then, we invoked the same Monotone Treatment Selection As-
sumption as we invoked in the analysis for dietary diversity (see
Results). That is, without forests, the counterfactual percentages of
households where all children ate vitamin A– or iron-rich food for for-
est households would be no higher than the percentages for nonforest
households (62% for vitamin A and 31% for iron). Thus, the lower
bounds of the ranges of impact estimates are reduced to 11% (73 to
62) for vitamin A and 16% (47 to 31) for iron (Fig. 5).
Confidence intervals
We computed cluster-robust confidence intervals for all our estimated
impacts (including the heterogeneous impacts) with SEs clustered at the
community level to account for the nonindependence of households
within a community. The confidence intervals of the ranges of estimates
from the partial identification approach are based on the procedure de-
scribed in King and Zeng (54). We used the R “clusterSEs” package (55)
for the confidence intervals of the average impact estimates and the
R function developed by Hanauer and Canavire-Bacarreza (56) for
those of the heterogeneity of impact analyses.
