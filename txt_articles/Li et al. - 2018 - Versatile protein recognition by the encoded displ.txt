Abstract 
In nature, specific antibodies can be generated as a result of an adaptive selection and expansion of 
lymphocytes with suitable protein binding properties. We attempted to mimic the antibody-antigen 
recognition by displaying multiple chemical diversity elements on a defined macrocyclic scaffold. 
Encoding of the displayed combinations was achieved using distinctive DNA tags, resulting in a library 
size of 35,393,112. Specific binders could be isolated against a variety of proteins, including carbonic 
anhydrase IX, horseradish peroxidase, tankyrase 1, human serum albumin, alpha-1 acid glycoprotein, 
calmodulin, prostate specific antigen and tumor necrosis factor. Similar to antibodies, the encoded display 
of multiple chemical elements on a constant scaffold enabled practical applications, such as fluorescence 
microscopy procedures or the selective in vivo delivery of payloads to tumors. Furthermore, the versatile 
structure of the scaffold facilitated the generation of protein specific chemical probes, as illustrated by 
photo-crosslinking.

Versatile and specific recognition of target proteins is a fundamentally important feature of the humoral 
arm of the adaptive immune system. Indeed, antibodies can be raised against virtually any antigen, by 
suitable immunization procedures1. This natural process of clonal selection and amplification can be 
mimicked in vitro by the construction of large combinatorial antibody libraries and the implementation of 
efficient selection systems (e.g., phage display technology2), which allow the generation of “man-made” 
antibodies3-5. The selected antibodies from phage display libraries can also be used for pharmaceutical 
applications; for example, the TNF-inhibitor Humira™ (one of the best-selling drugs in the world) was 
generated using this technology. 
There is a great scientific and industrial interest to isolate molecules which are substantially smaller 
than antibodies, but which retain the ability to recognize various target proteins with high binding affinity 
and specificity. Such molecules would be less immunogenic, should penetrate tissues more efficiently and 
therefore could be advantageous for certain pharmaceutical applications6. Large combinatorial libraries of 
polypeptides, developed from display methods, (e.g. phage display7, mRNA display8,9, yeast display10 and 
ribosome display11) have demonstrated the ability to yield specific binders against different proteins. 
However, those polypeptides are still mainly composed of proteinogenic amino acids and are developed 
using biosynthetic methodologies.  
Serving as a chemical solution for exponentially generating molecular diversity, DNA-encoded 
chemical libraries (DECLs) are increasingly being employed for the isolation of small-molecule binders 
against target proteins of interest12,13. The technology couples the power of genetics with chemical 
synthesis, allowing the generation of large sets of synthetic molecules, each linked to a distinctive DNA 
fragment serving as amplifiable identification barcode14,15. Compared with conventional screening 
methodologies such as high-throughput screening and non-encoded combinatorial libraries, DECL 
technology allows the rapid and rather inexpensive construction of very large chemical libraries of typically 
millions to billions of compounds, which can be quickly interrogated for target binding by affinity-based 
selection procedures followed by decoding with high-throughput DNA sequencing (HTDS)16. 
 
Most of the DECLs reported so far by both academia and industry were constructed by split-and-pool 
synthetic procedures16-18, aiming at drug-like molecules complying with Lipinski’s rule of five (RO5)19.  
Further approaches for the construction of DECLs have been proposed featuring, e.g., DNA-based routing20, 
DNA-templated synthesis21-23, or fragment-based strategies24-27. While RO5-type DECLs may 
preferentially yield binders for targets with defined pockets, such as proteases28, kinases17 or phosphatases29, 
the recognition of large surfaces of target proteins remains a challenge. The intrinsically larger size and 
complexity of macrocycles suggests their usefulness for the recognition of larger target surfaces, however, 
the pharmaceutical properties of macrocyclic binders may be difficult to optimize, since modification on 
the cyclic backbone may lead to unexpected conformational changes7,30. 
In this article, we explored a strategy featuring the encoded combinatorial display of multiple chemical 
diversity elements (DEs) on a structurally-defined macrocyclic scaffold, in order to achieve a versatile and

specific recognition of different target proteins. To that aim, we sought out a fixed macrocyclic scaffold 
with antiparallel b-sheets, previously described by Manfred Mutter and Pascal Dumy, which serves as a 
defined platform for the presentation of multiple chemical diversity elements into one side of the b-sheet 
plane (Fig. 1a)31-33. The constant macrocyclic scaffold also contains a further chemically addressable site, 
which facilitates the encoding of individual synthetic combinations with distinctive DNA tags, serving as 
amplifiable identification barcodes for further selection procedures. Alternatively, the same site can be 
modified with various chemical entities, thus allowing binder validation experiments or chemical biology 
applications34. Our strategy of directed display of multiple diversity elements on a constant macrocyclic 
scaffold yielded specific binders against various target proteins and the resulting binders exhibited 
antibody-like properties, enabling biochemical and biological applications.

Results 
  
Library design and synthesis. We first synthesized the cyclic peptide scaffold 1 (Fig. 1b) by using a solid-
phase peptide synthesis approach, followed by cyclisation of the pre-organized linear precursor. Three 
lysine side-chains (highlighted in red at position 3, green at position 5 and dark blue at position 8, pointing 
to one side of the b-sheet plane; Fig. 1b) were masked with mutually orthogonal protecting groups and 
subsequently coupled with sets of chemical diversity elements, under DNA-compatible conditions 
(Supplementary Fig. 3). The lysine at position 9 (highlighted in light blue; Fig. 1b), pointing to the other 
side of the b-sheet plane, was used for the stepwise incorporation of DNA tags or for later stage 
functionalization. Position 10 (highlighted in magenta; Fig. 1b) was reserved as a fourth potential diversity 
site, which could be used for the conjugation of additional diversity elements or as a chemical handle for 
specific needs (e.g., photo-crosslinking). 
Library synthesis was accomplished with three rounds of chemical coupling and encoding (Fig. 1c). 
Scaffold 1 was conjugated to 283 individual oligonucleotides, which encoded the first diversity site (Tfa 
site). The resulting conjugates were further coupled with 281 carboxylic acids acting as diversity elements 
(DE-1 representing the first diversity element, in all 3D cubes of Fig. 2), while the two residual 
oligonucleotides were used as controls (“Tfa-on” and “Tfa-off”). After Nvoc deprotection by UV 
irradiation, the conjugates were pooled to a mixture, followed by splitting into 386 vials for the subsequent 
modification with a second set of different carboxylic acids (DE-2 representing the second diversity 
element in Fig. 2). The resulting conjugates were encoded by an enzymatic ligation procedure. After a 
further pool-and-split step, the third site diversification (DE-3 representing the third diversity element in 
Fig. 2) was performed either through a copper-catalyzed cycloaddition with a set of terminal alkynes or by 
Staudinger reduction, followed by the acylation with a set of carboxylic acids. The last encoding step, 
featuring Klenow polymerization with partially complementary oligonucleotides, led to the formation of 
double-stranded DNA, corresponding to an encoded library comprising 35,393,112 displayed combinations 
on a constant macrocyclic scaffold (ETH-YL library).  
The coupling efficiency of all employed chemical diversity elements to DNA was evaluated in model 
reactions before library construction35,36. Shifts of the average mass of conjugate mixtures after the second 
and third coupling step were monitored by LC-MS17, and only diversity elements with conversion yields of 
over 80 % were included in the final library (Supplementary Figs. 10 and 12). The efficiency of the DNA-
encoding procedure was also checked by gel electrophoresis and LC-MS (Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15). 
HTDS data of the library pool prior to selection exhibited a uniform distribution of sequence counts, 
providing additional support for the homogeneity of the library construction (Supplementary Fig. 16).

Selection experiments and binder validation. Affinity-based selections of our library with biotinylated 
proteins were performed according to a previously published procedure and decoded by HTDS37. Fig. 2 
presents the results of affinity selections against nine different target proteins as “fingerprints”: The 
frequency of the sequenced DNA codes (counts) for each DE-1, DE-2, DE-3 combination can be plotted as 
individual dots, using both a Jet colour code (from blue to red) and the dot size (from small to large) to rank 
the counts of the displayed combinations, in a 3D cube with the axes DE-1, DE-2, and DE-3.  
Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and tankyrase 1 (TNKS 1) served as 
positive controls, as the library contained diversity elements that were known to bind to these proteins. As 
expected, selections against CAIX revealed one plane of enriched combinations (DE-1_DE-2_17, 
highlighted in green), which corresponds to acetazolamide, a nanomolar binder to this protein (Fig. 2a)38. 
Selections against HRP (Fig. 2b) revealed an enriched phenolic structure (24_DE-2_DE-3 and DE-
1_28_DE-3, respectively)39. Fig. 2c shows a plane of enriched compounds, featuring the presence of a 
chemical moiety (DE-1_DE-2_200, highlighted in green) that had previously been reported as a TNKS 1 
binder40. 
The fingerprint of the human serum albumin (HSA) selection (Fig. 2d) showed a scattered pattern of 
displayed combinations. We synthesized two enriched combinations (138_115_47 and 95_38_261) as 
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled derivatives in the absence of DNA and used them in 
fluorescence polarization (FP) measurements, revealing dissociation constants in the single-digit 
micromolar range (Kd = 6.6 µM and 22 µM, respectively, Fig. 3).  
The selection against alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) revealed a preferential enrichment of two 
identical sets of three chemical diversity elements, which were located at different positions on the scaffold 
(Fig. 3b). This corresponds to a “pseudo-rotation” of the three displayed chemical moieties along the 
defined scaffold. Synthetic FITC-labelled derivatives of these combinations (AGP-1 and AGP-2) showed a 
similar AGP binding affinity (2.2 µM and 3.5 µM, respectively, Fig. 3) in FP measurements. AGP-linear, 
a linear analogue of AGP-1, was synthesized and exhibited a 7-fold decrease in binding affinity (Kd = 15 
µM), indicating a contribution of the cyclic nature of the scaffold to protein recognition (Supplementary 
Fig. 29). 
A further selection against calmodulin (CaM) evidenced a preferential enrichment of an identical 
biphenyl moiety at the first and the second diversity site, respectively (Fig. 2f). The corresponding bivalent 
binder CaM-2 had a Kd = 5 µM (Fig. 3), while the monovalent binder CaM-1 bound to CaM with a Kd = 33 
µM. Inclusion of a third binding moiety led to the trivalent derivative CaM-3 with a submicromolar 
dissociation constant (Kd = 0.16 µM).   
The fingerprint of a selection against human prostate specific antigen (PSA), a tumor marker, revealed 
lines of enriched combinations in a plane, corresponding to DE-3 = 17 (highlighted in green; Fig. 2g). This 
finding implies that, while DE-3 = 17 plays an essential role, additional diversity elements contribute to 
protein recognition. The enriched combination 205_182_17 (PSA-1) showed a Kd = 13 µM, while the 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7 
progressive removal of individual diversity elements led to a continuous loss of binding affinity (PSA-2 
and PSA-3; Fig. 3). 
We also performed selections against human tumor necrosis factor, used both as recombinant protein 
(TNF) and as TNF-antibody fusion (L19-TNF). We identified two diversity element combinations 
(20_361_106 and 170_65_54) as individual spots in the L19-TNF selection fingerprint (Fig. 2h), with high 
enrichment (Fig. 3b). The corresponding synthetic derivatives TNF-1 and TNF-2 exhibited Kd = 6.1 µM 
and 22 µM, respectively. The combination 20_361_106 was enriched also in the TNF selection fingerprint 
(Fig. 2i), indicating that binding was directed against the TNF moiety. The Kd of TNF-1 to TNF was found 
to be 15 µM, while TNF-2 did not exhibit considerable TNF binding (Fig. 3). 
The utility of a constant macrocyclic scaffold lends itself to a further investigation of the impact of the 
flexibility of the scaffold and the length of the lysine sidechains, which serve as linkers between the 
diversity elements and the scaffold itself, on the binding affinity of the selected binders. A previous study 
reported that a substitution of two L-proline residues with D-proline in the macrocyclic backbone leads to 
an even more restricted b-hairpin conformation33.  For the TNF binder D-TNF-1 and the PSA binder D-
PSA-1, this substitution could be implemented, resulting in neither a significant loss nor gain of binding 
affinity (Supplementary Figs. 54 and 67). Shortening the linker sidechains by 1, 2 or 3 methylene groups, 
however, lead to a loss in binding affinity for the PSA binder (Supplementary Fig. 54). Interestingly, in the 
case of the TNF binder, the substitution of the diversity elements-displaying lysine with ornithine residues 
lead to a 6-fold increase in binding affinity of TNF-1, while further shortening of the linker sidechains had 
a detrimental effect on Kd values (Supplementary Fig. 67).  
 
In vitro and in vivo applications of selected binders. In order to test whether the selected synthetic 
binders could be used like antibodies in certain applications, we first investigated the performance of the 
binder PSA-1 in a fluorescence microscopy analysis of human prostate tissue expressing PSA. The 
synthetic FITC-labelled derivative was incubated with the tissue sections and detected, using an anti-FITC 
antibody as secondary reagent. This procedure stained the glandular structures, which are known to express 
PSA. The same structures were also stained by an anti-PSA antibody, which served as a positive control 
(Fig. 4a). As negative control, the FITC-labelled capped scaffold SC-2 was used. In a second application, 
we injected mice (bearing a subcutaneously-grafted tumor, expressing CAIX) with CAIX-IRDye, a 
derivative conjugated with acetazolamide as diversity elements and carrying a near-infrared dye for 
detection. Imaging at different time points revealed a preferential accumulation of the CAIX binder in the 
tumor, while no preferential tumor uptake could be observed when the capped scaffold SC-IRDye was 
used as a negative control (Fig. 4b).  
 
Development of chemical probes. We installed a photo-crosslinking moiety on the fourth diversity site of 
the scaffold, in order to convert binders into chemical probes for specific protein labelling applications. As 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 
an illustrative example, we fused a photo-crosslinking moiety (phenyl azide) to the trivalent CaM binder 
(CaM-3), generating a probe (CaM-PC; Fig. 5a). Incubation of this probe with CaM in the presence of a 5-
fold excess of HSA, followed by UV irradiation (Fig. 5b), led to the preferential photo-crosslinking of the 
probe to CaM rather than to HSA, as evidenced by gel electrophoretic analysis (lane 4 in Fig. 5c). A control 
probe (SC-PC), consisting of the scaffold equipped with the photo-crosslinking moiety but devoid of the 
CaM recognition elements, did not label CaM, as expected (lane 6, Fig. 5c). The formation of a covalent 
conjugate with CaM under irradiation was further confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis (Fig. 5d).

Discussion  
We have described the synthesis of a DNA-encoded chemical library based on the display of multiple 
diversity elements on a constant macrocyclic scaffold, containing over 35 million combinations. We used 
optimized DNA-compatible synthetic procedures41, in order to ensure high library quality, which is a 
prerequisite for good performance in selections and for the identification of structure-activity 
relationships40,42,43. 
The encoded library yielded binders against various, structurally diverse target proteins. This feature is 
reminiscent of the performance of large combinatorial libraries of antibodies (e.g., phage display libraries), 
which produce useful binding specificities against the majority of target proteins. The typical dissociation 
constants for binders isolated from our library were in the single-digit micromolar range, while phage 
display libraries containing billions of clones typically yield antibody fragments with Kd values in the 10 
nM to 1 µM range44-46. Interestingly, it has previously been reported that the use of a smaller portion 
(containing only 10 million library members) of a 65 billion-membered phage-display library in selection 
experiments yielded binders with Kd values ranging between 0.8 µM and 12 µM44. These findings suggest 
that binders of higher affinity may be isolated from larger libraries based on the design strategy reported in 
this article, featuring the incorporation of more chemical diversity elements on the same scaffold. On the 
other hand, the structure-activity relationships obtained from selection experiment of our library as 
fingerprints for a given target allow the construction of a next-generation library by using structural 
analogues of the enriched chemical diversity elements on the scaffold, in analogy to the stepwise process 
often used for the affinity maturation of antibodies47-49. Alternatively, we have shown that fine-tuning of 
certain structural features of the constant scaffold may also have an impact on dissociation constants 
(Supplementary Fig. 67).  
An antibody recognizes its antigen as a result of numerous interactions between its multiple residues in 
the hypervariable loops and the contact residues of the antigen. Interestingly, specific antibodies could also 
be isolated from “designer” combinatorial libraries, in which the multiple antigen-contacting sites of the 
hypervariable loops contained a restricted set of diversity elements50. To the other extreme, the fixed 
macrocyclic scaffold described in this article displays only three spatially oriented sets of chemical 
diversity elements. This chemical strategy was sufficient to generate specific binders against different 
target proteins, providing further evidence that certain antibody properties for recognition may be 
“minimized” (i.e., converted into smaller chemical structures, capable of similar performance)51. The 
diversity elements that could be employed in our strategy, are not limited to proteinogenic aminoacids as 
required by antibodies, and can be chosen from a broader chemical space. 
There is a growing interest in the field of macrocycles for drug discovery52. However, it might be 
difficult to improve their pharmaceutical properties, as modifications of the backbone can lead to 
conformational changes30. The nature of the constant macrocyclic scaffold for this study allows the display 
of diversity elements in a pre-defined spatial orientation (as shown both by NMR studies32 and by X-ray 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 
crystallography33), and facilitates the incorporation of additional chemical moieties, such as photo-
crosslinkers, fluorophores or other payloads, for further applications.  
In summary, we have shown that an encoded library, containing over 35 million displayed combinations 
on a constant macrocyclic scaffold, yielded specific binders against multiple target proteins, including 
“difficult” targets (e.g., TNF). The binders discovered from our library enabled biochemical applications, 
(e.g., immunofluorescence tissue staining procedures and in vivo delivery of payloads to tumors) with 
antibody-like performance and the development of a chemical probe. Our strategy may facilitate chemical 
biology research and the development of novel classes of pharmaceutical products.

Methods 
Detailed methods, synthetic procedures and characterization of the presented ETH-YL library and 
compounds are described in the Supplementary Information. 
Library synthesis. The scaffold 1 was conjugated to amino-modified oligonucleotides (code 1: 5’-amino-
C6-GGAGCTTCTGAATTCTGTGTG CTGNNNNNNCGAGTCCCATGGCGC-3’-OH, N representing 
variable bases serving as code) using a reported EDC/HOAt method36. The conjugates were precipitated 
with ethanol before purification by HPLC. Tfa-deprotection was performed with ammonium hydroxide (25 % 
aq), followed by immobilization on diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) sepharose. The first diversification 
elements were coupled to oligonucleotides with EDC-HCl/HOAt on pseudo-solid phase35 and resulting 
DNA-conjugates were then isolated by ethanol precipitation. The individual conjugates with the first 
diversity elements were subjected to irradiation at 365 nm at 0 °C for 60 min, followed by equimolar 
pooling of the 283 conjugates. The first pool was further divided into 386 aliquots and coupled with the 
second diversity elements using the same EDC-HCl/HOAt conditions. Individual conjugates with second 
diversity elements were employed in an enzymatic ligation step. To the conjugates, 5’-phosphorylated-
oligonucleotides (code 2: 5’-phosphate-CGGATCGACGNNNNNNNGCGTCAGGCAGC-3’-OH) and a 
“splint” oligonucleotide (5’-OH-CGTCGATCCGGCGCCATGGG-3’-OH) were added, followed by 
addition of ligase buffer and T4 DNA ligase. The ligation was allowed for 6 h at 22 °C. Equimolar amounts 
of the 386 conjugates were combined to generate the second pool, followed by ethanol precipitation and 
HPLC purification. A portion of the second pool was divided into 136 aliquots and was immobilized on 
DEAE speharose. The resin was washed with aq. AcOH (3 × 0.5 mL, 10 mM), H2O (3 × 0.5 mL) and 
DMSO: H2O: tBuOH = 4 : 3 : 1 (3 × 0.5 mL). To the resin-immobilized conjugates, a solution of the 
corresponding alkyne diversity element (20 mM), TBTA (10 mM), CuSO4 (2.5 mM) and ascorbate (10 mM) 
in DMSO: H2O: tBuOH = 4 : 3 : 1 (0.2 mL) was added. The slurry was agitated for 4 hours at 25 ºC. The 
coupling solution was removed and the resin washed with DMSO: H2O: tBuOH = 4 : 3 : 1 (6 × 0.5 mL),  aq. 
EDTA (3 × 0.5 mL, 50 mM) and aq. AcOH (3 × 0.5 mL, 10 mM). The conjugates were eluted from the 
resin by incubation with aq. AcOH (3 × 0.2 mL, 3 M) for 5 min. A further portion of the second pool was 
dissolved in Tris-HCl (500 mM, pH 8.0) and treated with TCEP-HCl (100 mM). The Staudinger reduction 
lasted for 12 hours at 25 °C and the reduction products were isolated by ethanol precipitation. The 
reduction products were further split into 185 aliquots and conjugated with 185 carboxylic acids using the 
above-mentioned EDC-HCl/HOAt method. Individual conjugates with the third diversity elements were 
further subjected to polymerase extension using oligonucleotides of following sequence for encoding (code 
3: 5’-OH-GCTCTGCACGGTCGCNNNNNNNGCTGCCTGACGC-3’-OH). Equimolar amounts of the 
324 conjugates were combined to generate the final library of 35 million combinations. For further details, 
see Supplementary Information.

Fluorescence polarization measurement with FITC-labelled binders. Freshly dissolved FITC labelled 
binders (7.5 µL, final concentration 50 nM, 1 % DMSO) were incubated at 22 °C for 10 min in a black 
384-well plate (Greiner, non-binding) in PBS with increasing concentrations of protein to a final volume of 
15 µL. The fluorescence anisotropy was measured on a Spectra Max Paradigm multimode plate reader 
(Molecular Devices). Experiments were performed in triplicate and the mean anisotropy values were fitted 
to equation 3, see Supplementary Information. 
Mass spectrometry analysis of CaM-probe covalent complex. In a 96-well plate, CaM (10 µM) in 
Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (10 % DMSO) was incubated with the probe (CaM-PC, 10 µM) for 
10 min at 0 °C with gentle shaking. The samples were irradiated at 365 nm for 15 min at 0 °C. Protein 
samples were purified on Vivaspin 500 centrifugal concentrators and dissolved in 100 µL PBS. A Xevo 
G2-XS Q-TOF with electrospray ionization source was used for detection.

Figure 1 | Design, synthesis, encoding and selection of the multiple display DNA-encoded chemical library. 
a, Protein recognition by encoded multiple display of chemical elements on a constant macrocyclic scaffold. b, scaffold 
1 containing three diversity sites, one potential diversity site and one site for DNA tagging. c, Scheme of library 
construction by a split-and-pool strategy employing three rounds of coupling and encoding with DNA tags. The 
performance of selection procedures on immobilized target proteins of interest allows the isolation of binders, whose 
binding affinities can be confirmed after resynthesis. A schematic representation of a possible macrocycle is illustrated 
as an example. 
 
Figure 2 | Selection fingerprints from the multiple display DNA-encoded chemical library. a, High-throughput 
DNA sequencing (HTDS) plot of a selection against CAIX. The x-, y- and z-axes represent the first diversity element 
(DE-1, red), second diversity element (DE-2, dark blue), and third diversity element (DE-3, green) of the library, 
respectively. Jet colour scale and dot size represent the HTDS sequence counts. Total sequence counts (TSC) =

Figure 3 | Binder validation of selected combinations against HSA, AGP, CaM, PSA, L19-TNF and TNF.  a, 
fluorescence polarization measurements of selected fluorescently-labeled compounds against HSA, AGP, CaM, PSA, 
L19-TNF and TNF. A shift of the sigmoidal curves to the left for selected compounds indicates a contribution of the 
displayed chemical diversity elements to the binding affinity, compared to the unmodified scaffold controls (SC-1 and 
SC-2). Error bars indicate the standard deviation of three measurements. b, Enrichments and dissociation constants of 
synthesized compounds, chemical structures and corresponding identification numbers (ID) of the three diversity 
elements. For calculation of enrichment see Supplementary Table 7. SC-1 and SC-2 are two respective scaffold 
controls capped at the diversity sites; see Supplementary Figs. 21 and 44 for detailed structures. n.d. = not determined.1

Figure 4 | Immunofluoresence performance of selected PSA binder and in vivo performance of CAIX binder. 
 a, Upper panels: micrographs illustrating PSA localization by binding to PSA-1, SC-2, and to a mouse anti-PSA 
antibody. The sections were incubated with PSA-1 or SC-2 (0.5 µM each), treated with rabbit anti-FITC antibody, and 
detected by goat anti-rabbit antibody-Alexa 488. For comparison, the third section was incubated with mouse anti-PSA 
antibody and detected with goat anti-mouse antibody-Alexa 488. Lower panels: DAPI staining of the same sections. 
Some glandular structures are indicated with red arrows. DAPI: 4′, 6-Diamidine-2′-phenylindole. b, Evaluation of the 
targeting performance of IRDye-680 conjugates CAIX-IRDye and of the control SC-IRDye, using near-infrared 
fluorescence imaging of BALB/c nu/nu mice bearing SKRC-52 xenografts, after intravenous administration of 3 nmol 
of conjugates. Images were acquired with identical parameters at 5 min, 1 h, 3 h and 7 h after injection. Right: imaging
