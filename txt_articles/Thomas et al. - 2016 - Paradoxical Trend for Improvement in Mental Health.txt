Abstract
Objective—Studies of aging usually focus on trajectories of physical and cognitive function, 
with far less emphasis on overall mental health, despite its impact on general health and mortality. 
This study examined linear and non-linear trends of physical, cognitive, and mental health over the 
entire adult lifespan.
Method—Cross-sectional data were obtained from 1,546 individuals aged 21 to 100 years, 
selected using random digit dialing for the Successful AGing Evaluation (SAGE) study, a 
structured multi-cohort investigation, that included telephone interviews and in-home surveys of 
community-based adults without dementia. Data were collected from 1/26/2010 to 10/07/2011 
targeting participants aged 50 to 100 years, and 6/25/2012 to 7/15/2013 targeting participants aged 
21 to 50 years. Data included self-report measures of physical health, measures of both positive 
and negative attributes of mental health, and a phone interview-based measure of cognition.
Results—Comparison of age cohorts using polynomial regression suggested a possible 
accelerated deterioration in physical and cognitive functioning, averaging one-and-a-half to two 
standard deviations over the adult lifespan. In contrast, there appeared to be a linear improvement 
of about one standard deviation in various attributes of mental health over the same life period.
Conclusion—These cross-sectional findings suggest the possibility of a linear improvement in 
mental health beginning in young adulthood rather than a U-shaped curve reported in some prior 
studies. Lifespan research combining psychosocial and biological markers may improve our 
understanding of resilience to mental disability in older age, and lead to broad-based interventions 
promoting mental health in all age groups.

 INTRODUCTION
Traditionally, aging has been conceptualized as an ongoing process of physical and cognitive 
decline, with far less emphasis on mental health. Yet, in a recent national poll, 89% of 
American adults reported that mental health was as important as physical health.1. Impaired 
mental health can adversely impact self-care and is a leading cause of disability.2 
Furthermore, untreated mental health problems often have a deleterious effect on physical 
health.3
Although mental health of older people might be assumed to follow a deteriorating course in 
step with worsening physical and cognitive function, findings regarding subjective well-
being have been mixed.4,5 Some investigators find a U-shaped curve of well-being across the 
lifespan, with declines from early adulthood to middle age followed by improvement during 
later adulthood.6–8 Other studies report contradictory findings,9–11 including increase, 
decline, or flat trajectory of psychological well-being across early adulthood. Charles et al.10 
showed declines in negative affect while positive affect remained stable. Vaillant and Blazer 
have described successful cognitive and emotional aging in specific groups of older 
adults.12–16 The reasons for differences in results are not obvious. Springer et al. suggest 
changes in well-being with ages may be due to measurement variation across studies,17 with 
many studies focusing on single domains of physical18,19 or cognitive health20 or on single 
indicators of mental health such as psychological well-being.
Psychological well-being21 should be distinguished from the multidimensional construct of 
mental health, which also includes perceived stress and absence of anxiety and depressive 
symptoms. The effects of age may vary depending on the specific domain(s) assessed. In one 
study,7 happiness, enjoyment, and the inverse of sadness were all U-shaped, while stress, 
worry, and anger showed apparent improvements with aging.7 Thus, the empirical literature 
is inconsistent regarding the pattern of change in mental health across the adult lifespan.
Epidemiologic studies have reported lower prevalence of all mental illnesses, except for 
neurocognitive disorders, in older adults.22–25 The reasons remain unclear. Common 
explanations include inappropriate diagnostic criteria for geriatric mental disorders, older 
patients’ reluctance or inability (due to memory difficulties) to report mental problems, and 
mis-attribution of psychological symptoms to physical illnesses.26 However, survivor effects 
also may play a role – i.e., the adults who survive into older age may have better mental 
health than younger counterparts. Additional studies of aging, using validated measures of 
broadly defined mental health along with physical and cognitive functioning across the adult 
lifespan, are needed.
We simultaneously examined physical health, cognitive function, and several measures of 
mental health across the adult lifespan (age 21–100 years) in a community sample. Unlike 
many studies using samples of convenience, we obtained a sample in San Diego County, 
California, using random digit dialing, with nearly equal numbers of men and women, 
stratified by age decade, and an oversampling of adults over age 75. We hypothesized that 
while physical and cognitive function would be lower among successively older age cohorts,

 mental health would follow a non-linear, U-shaped trend, with middle-aged cohorts 
evidencing the worst mental health relative to younger and older cohorts.
METHODS
Participants
Participants included 1,546 community-dwelling adults from the University of California 
(UC) San Diego Successful AGing Evaluation (SAGE) study.27 A structured multi-cohort 
design was used to recruit residents of San Diego County. The study originally targeted 
adults aged 50–100 years, but subsequently we added participants aged 21–50 years. Partial 
data in adults age 50+ have been reported previously27,28 in regard to self-perceived 
successful aging, but this report represents our first examination of the life-span trajectory of 
physical, cognitive, and mental health in the entire age range. Exclusion criteria were: 1) 
residence in a nursing home or need for daily skilled nursing care, 2) self-reported prior 
diagnosis of dementia, 3) terminal illness or need for hospice care, and 4) inability to 
understand written or spoken English. Participants who completed a 25-minute structured 
telephone interview, that included cognitive assessment, were subsequently mailed a survey 
questionnaire that asked for detailed demographic and clinical information and included a 
number of rating scales and other measures. The enrollment sequence is depicted in 
Supplemental (on-line only) Figure 1. Participants were compensated $10 for their 
participation in the phone interview and $15 for the completion of their baseline SAGE 
Survey. The study was approved by UC San Diego, Human Research Protections Program.
Measures
Physical health—This construct was operationally defined as a composite of self-reported 
Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, and General Health subscale total scores 
from the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36).29,30 Subjects 
rated themselves on both the presence of good (or poor) health and its functional 
consequences. To create the composite, we standardized scores from each subscale, 
computed the average value, and then standardized the outcome (z-scores). Unlike the 
manual-based scoring method for the SF-36 - which includes both physical and mental 
health subscale scores to determine the physical health composite, our composite was 
composed of physical health subscales only, in order to operationalize physical health 
independently of mental health. The internal consistency of the modified physical composite 
was high (α=0.81) and variance was dominated by a general factor (ωh=0.75).
Cognitive function—This was assessed by total scores on the Telephone Interview of 
Cognitive Status - Modified (TICS-M).31 TICS-M scores are documented as having good 
convergent31 and discriminant32 validity.
Mental health—This construct was operationally defined as a composite of 3 measures 
reflecting positive and 3 reflecting negative attributes. Measures reflecting positive attributes 
included total scores on the Happiness Subscale33 of the Center for Epidemiological Studies 
– Depression scale (CES-D); the Satisfaction with Life Scale;34 and a composite of Vitality, 
Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and Mental Health subscale total scores from the

 SF-36.29 Negative attributes were assessed with total scores on the Brief Symptom Inventory 
Anxiety Scale;35 Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Module (PHQ-9);36 and 
Perceived Stress Scale.37,38 We created the mental health composite by standardizing the 
scores reflecting 3 positive and 3 negative psychological attributes, calculating the average 
value (with negative attributes weighted by −1), and then standardizing the outcome. The 
internal consistency of the composite was high (α=0.87) and variance was dominated by a 
general factor (ωh=0.82).
Analyses
To evaluate aging-associated trends in physical, cognitive, and mental health, we fitted 
power polynomial regression models to each construct.39 These models sought to determine 
whether, and how, the relationship between age and each construct was linear or nonlinear. 
We hierarchically compared models that included linear, linear and quadratic, or linear, 
quadratic, and cubic effects of (centered) age. Polynomial terms allow nonlinear curves or 
bends in the relationship between variables. Models with linear terms allow zero bends, 
models with linear and a single nonlinear (quadratic) term allow one bend, and models with 
linear and two nonlinear (quadratic and cubic) terms allow two bends. The linear term 
indicates whether the relationship between variables generally rises or falls; the nonlinear 
(quadratic and cubic) terms indicate whether the bends are concave upward or downward. 
All models also included gender and marital status (contrast coded), and education (linear 
trend coded).40 Additionally, we assessed age effects for each scale contributing to the 
mental health composite. Models were compared using likelihood ratio tests. Effect size was 
quantified in terms of increment in variance accounted for (ΔR2) comparing nested models. 
All analyses were conducted using R.41
RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
Mean age was 66 years (SD=21; range=21–99), and 51% were men. Highest level of 
education completed was ≤12 years for 20%, 13–16 years (Bachelor’s degree) for 60%, and 
post-graduate education for 21% of the sample. Seventy-six percent identified as non-Latino 
Caucasian, 14% as Hispanic/Latino, 7% Asian-American, 1% African American, and 2% 
other ethnic or racial backgrounds.
Age-associated Trends in Physical Health, Cognitive Function, and Mental Health
Tables 1, 2, and 3 show results of regression analyses for physical, cognitive, and mental 
health variables, respectively. For ease of communication, results are described in terms of 
age-associated deterioration or improvement in health; however, within-subject changes can 
only be inferred from longitudinal data. Interpretive limitations of the cross-sectional design 
are discussed below.
While physical and cognitive function showed nonlinear (accelerating) worsening with age, 
mental health showed linear improvement. Specifically, the physical health model with 
gender, education, and marital status was improved by adding a linear effect of age (ΔR2=.
125) as well as a nonlinear (quadratic) effect (ΔR2=.004), but not a second nonlinear (cubic)

 effect. The cognitive function model was improved by adding a linear effect of age (ΔR2=.
197) as well as a nonlinear (quadratic) effect (ΔR2=.033) and a second nonlinear (cubic) 
effect (ΔR2=.003). The mental health model was improved by adding a linear effect of age 
(ΔR2 = .046) but not by adding nonlinear (quadratic and cubic) effects.
Predicted values for the best fitting regression models are plotted in Figure 1 (corresponding 
observed data are reported in Supplemental Figure 2). Successively older cohorts had better 
mental health despite having successively worse physical and cognitive function than 
younger cohorts. Across the 80 cross-sectional years of data, participants reported, on 
average, approximately a 1.5 standard deviation (SD) drop in self-reported physical health 
and a 2 SD decline in cognitive function. Cognitive function appeared very non-linear, with 
accelerating decline beginning in the 60s. The apparent improvement in mental health with 
age was linear with participants reporting nearly 1 SD of change, on average.
It has been argued that the U-shaped curve frequently seen in studies of well-being is an 
artifact of inappropriately controlling for marital status and education, as these variables are 
possibly influenced by well-being42. In the present data, results without these covariates 
were similar except for a few minor differences – i.e., the nonlinear (quadratic) effect of age 
on mental health was additionally significant and the second nonlinear (cubic) effect of age 
on cognitive function was non-significant. Interpretively, mental health showed slight 
inverted U-shaped trend with age that peaked in late life and cognitive function showed an 
inverted U-shaped trend that peaked in early life.
Figure 2 shows predicted age-related trends in the individual mental health scores that 
contributed to the composite. Scores on the Happiness Subscale, and reverse-coded Anxiety 
Scale and Depression Scale all improved with age (linear terms of b=0.0108, SE=0.0013, 
p<.001; b=0.0068, SE=0.0013, p<.001; and b=0.0085, SE=0.0013, p<.001, respectively). 
Both the SF-36 mental health composite and the reverse-coded Perceived Stress Scale score 
demonstrated inverted U-shaped effects (linear terms of b=0.0011, SE=0.0015, p=.486; and 
b=0.0075, SE=0.0015, p<.001, respectively, and quadratic terms of b=−0.0002, SE=0.0001, 
p=.005; and b=−0.0001, SE=0.0001, p=.037, respectively). The Satisfaction with Life Scale 
score demonstrated a U-shaped effect (linear term of b=0.0155, SE=0.0014, p<.001 and 
quadratic term of b=0.0001, SE=0.0001, p<.029).
DISCUSSION
Our findings support the existence of a “paradox” in which aging is associated with better 
mental health among older adults at the population level despite loss of physical and 
cognitive function. Consistent with prior research, relative to successively younger cohorts, 
older cohorts had worse physical and cognitive function,43–45 but better mental health. This 
pattern was observed in each successive age cohort from 20s through 90s. The magnitude of 
this change was substantial, with the oldest cohort having mental health scores 1 SD higher 
than the youngest cohort’s, in sharp contrast to the 1.5 and 2 SD differences (suggesting 
declines) in physical and cognitive function, respectively. The age effects on the composite 
mental health measure did not conform to a “U-shaped” curve, rather a linear increase from 
the 20s to the 90s provided the best fitting model.

 Study strengths include the structured multi-cohort design, subject selection using random 
digit dialing, oversampling of older adults (due to increased risk of drop-outs), and use of 
published, validated measures of various constructs simultaneously. However, our study also 
has limitations. First, data were cross-sectional; therefore, we cannot make longitudinal or 
causal inferences about changes in these domains for individual participants. The apparent 
changes might reflect birth cohort differences (e.g., baby boomers have a higher incidence of 
mental illnesses including depression, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders 
compared to the people born before the World War II)46 and/or survivor bias (i.e., less 
healthy younger adults are less likely to survive into old age). However, the negative 
trajectory of physical and cognitive health across age groups with expected magnitudes of 
decline argues against the older participants being super-healthy. While longitudinal studies 
to examine aging trajectories require many resources, are expensive, and require more than a 
decade of follow-up, employment of innovative study designs such as the multi-cohort 
longitudinal design that we used, can make such research more feasible. Second, self-report 
measures of physical and mental health could be less accurate than objective measures. 
However, investigations have shown self-reports of subjective functioning correlate 
significantly with objective measures of health (e.g., mortality)47 and of local community 
wellness,48 suggesting that subjective measures do have objective value. Third, 
representativeness of the sample might have varied across age groups. While we used 
random digit dialing to reduce bias in convenience sampling, our study protocol required 
participants be selected/contacted using a landline. Many younger adults use cell phones as 
their main form of communication;49 we might not have achieved a fully representative 
sample among younger age groups. However, cell phone numbers do not correspond to the 
local area code of residence and thus, do not help ascertain if the participant is located in 
San Diego county. Similarly, measurement floor or ceiling effects could have impacted the 
analyses. Furthermore, we did not use a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation to 
measure cognition, but rather a telephone-based screening tool (TICS-M). Although 
dementia was screened out by self-report, our sample likely included some individuals with 
previously undiagnosed dementia.32 Some of the observed cognitive decline beginning 
around age 65 may reflect such pathological cognitive aging. Finally, our sample was based 
in San Diego, and further studies of this type are needed in other regions to generalize our 
findings to communities with different population characteristics.
Notwithstanding these limitations, an intriguing question is whether the observed positive 
mental health in old age reflects favorable brain changes,50 or is the result of diminished risk 
factors for mental distress. One possibility is that older adults become more adept at coping 
with stressful changes.12,13,51–53 Similar to the literature on cognitive reserve in which 
passive versus active processes converge in maintaining cognitive function,54 active 
emotional reserve may enable older adults to counter threats to mental health such as 
diminishing physical health. Carstensen and colleagues have attributed such changes to 
socioemotional selectivity in later life, resulting from narrower horizon of life in view of the 
acknowledgement of mortality.14 Another possible explanation for greater life satisfaction 
among older adults is what Linda George described 30 years ago as “lowering [of] 
aspirations to meet realities.”55

 An important explanation for improved mental health in later life is increase in wisdom with 
aging, as suggested by several (but not all) studies.8,13,56 Researchers have reported that, 
compared to younger adults, older individuals tend to be more skilled at emotional 
regulation and complex social decision making, and to exhibit more positively valenced 
information processing.12–16 Others have found that as people age they experience fewer 
negative emotions, regulate their emotions more effectively, and show positive biases in their 
memory.57 One study reported older adults used accumulated lifetime experience in decision 
making to determine long-term utility rather than immediate gains.16 In one investigation, 
Gooding and colleagues reported older adults were more resilient than younger ones with 
respect to emotional regulation and problem solving.58 These behavioral changes parallel 
functional imaging studies showing diminished responsiveness of amygdala to negative or 
stressful images in older compared to younger adults.59 Such positivity may lead to higher 
levels of subjective well-being in later life.
Our results are consistent with epidemiological studies finding the prevalence of non-
dementing mental disorders decline incrementally from younger to older age groups.22–25 
Our results suggest that surviving older adults may be more resilient to common physical 
and social stresses compared to younger counterparts. A similar phenomenon may underlie 
the lower prevalence of mental illnesses in older adults, although there are alternative 
explanations such as under-diagnosis or mis-diagnosis of psychiatric conditions in later life.
At the same time, old age is often associated with serious physical, psychological, and social 
stresses. One must not underestimate the need for high quality mental and physical 
healthcare for older adults. Nonetheless, our study raises important questions about 
traditional conceptualization of models of aging, including biological ones, which focus on 
functional (physical and cognitive) declines with usual aging or employ longevity as the 
primary marker of successful aging. These models need revising to account for what may be 
“normative” improvement in mental health that may accompany population aging. Even 
among people with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, aging tends to be 
associated with improvement in mental health.60,61
Another notable finding relates to high levels of subjective (perceived) stress along with 
symptoms of depression and anxiety among those in their 20s and 30s. This “fountain of 
youth” is associated with far worse level of psychological well-being than during any other 
period of adulthood. There are many pressures rather unique to this life phase – e.g., 
establishing careers, finding life partners, and navigating financial issues.62 Whereas 
adolescence has long been an area of social and scientific concern, relatively little attention 
has been paid to issues that continue or get exacerbated post-adolescence. Of note, the rate 
of mental illness and treatment seeking in younger persons has been increasing sharply,63 
whereas rates of self-reported depressive symptoms in later life have declined.64
When treating younger adults, we should consider how to leverage positive mental health 
factors to augment their psychosocial functioning, whereas in older adults these factors may 
help with physical and cognitive functioning. There is a critical need for lifespan research 
combining psychosocial and biological sciences to improve our understanding of the

promote wellness in all age groups.

 CLINICAL POINTS
1.
Studies show declining physical and cognitive health during later phases of 
the lifespan; yet, few have examined trajectories of mental health in the 
context of these declines.
2.
Our results point to a progressive improvement in mental health (i.e., higher 
levels of life satisfaction, happiness, and well-being, and lower levels of 
anxiety, depression, and perceived stress) from age 21 through the 90s.
3.
When treating younger adults, consider how to leverage positive mental 
health factors in augmenting their psychosocial functioning, whereas in older 
adults these factors may help with physical and cognitive functioning.
