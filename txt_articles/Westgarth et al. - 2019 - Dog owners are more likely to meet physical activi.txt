previous research suggests that dog owners are slightly more physically active than those without 
dogs, but have only studied one household member, and it is unclear whether time spent dog walking 
replaces other physical activity (PA). A survey of 191 dog owning adults (DO), 455 non-dog owning 
adults (NDO), and 46 children, living in 385 households in West Cheshire UK, was conducted in July-
August 2015. Objective (accelerometer) validation occurred on a subset (n = 28 adults). Survey PA 
outcomes were modelled using hierarchical logistic and linear multivariable regression modelling, 
accounting for clustering of participants in households. DO were far more likely than NDO to report 
walking for recreation (oR = 14.35, 95% CI = 5.77–35.79, P < 0.001), and amongst recreational walkers 
walked for longer per week (RR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.27–5.91, P < 0.001). Other PA undertaken did not 
differ by dog ownership. The odds of DO meeting current physical activity guidelines of 150 mins per 
week were four times greater than for NDo (oR = 4.10, 95% CI = 2.05–8.19, P < 0.001). Children with 
dogs reported more minutes of walking (p = 0.01) and free-time (unstructured) activity (P < 0.01). 
Dog ownership is associated with more recreational walking and considerably greater odds of meeting 
PA guidelines. Policies regarding public spaces and housing should support dog ownership due to PA 
benefits.
Dog ownership is of public health interest due to the potential to promote health-enhancing physical activity 
(PA) and improved cardiovascular outcomes1. Evidence suggests dog ownership is associated with lower risk of 
death, and a lower risk of cardiovascular conditions at least in single-person households, where the participant 
may be more highly obligated to dog walk2. It is recommended that adults undertake at least 150 minutes of 
moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) per week3, but this is achieved by only 66% of men and 
58% of women in the England4, and under 50% of US adults5. A 2013 review concluded considerable evidence 
that dog owners were more physically active than people without a dog with small to moderate effect sizes1. 
However findings from some studies have been inconsistent, mainly because some owners do not walk with their

dogs6,7. Nevertheless, considering the number of households that own dogs (e.g 24% UK8, 48% USA9, and 39% 
Australia10), even small effect sizes might contribute considerable additional physical activity at the population 
level provided, of course, that the dogs are actually walked.
The different types of exercise that dog owners (DO) and non-dog owners (NDO) report participating in 
requires investigation. Dog walking is reported to be the only physical activity for some owners but for others it 
limits other activity (potentially of higher intensity) as ‘there are only so many hours in the day’ and the dog takes 
priority11. However, there is some evidence that participation in other types of MVPA is also greater in DO than 
NDO12. It is also not known what proportion of dog walking is undertaken for recreational reasons, and what 
proportion is dispersed practice13 e.g. primarily transport-related activity, such as walking to a local shop, to drop/
pick up from school, or to a work place. Anecdotally, other physical activities with a dog are also popular, such as 
jogging or cycling, but it is not known how common these are.
It is difficult to compare dog walking rates directly between countries as study designs and measures vary, 
but UK owners potentially participate in more dog walking than North America and Australia where most pre-
vious research has been conducted1, due to social and climatic differences. Daily walking of dogs is the accepted 
social expectation in the UK11 with this occurring for 78% of dogs in a UK study14. A common reason reported 
by USA dog owners for not walking their dog was that the dog self-exercised or was an outside dog (43%)7, and 
warm climates in Australia may have a similar effect. In contrast, only 4% of pet dogs in a UK community slept 
outside15. Dog owners are also more highly motivated to walk in bad weather than their non-dog owning coun-
terparts16, which could be advantageous for dog owners’ activity levels given the often cool and wet weather in the 
UK. Specific UK research has focused on older adults16; pregnant women17; children18; and adolescents19. To the 
author’s knowledge, no studies have investigated the association between dog ownership and PA in a general adult 
population, and this study aims to fill this gap. This will allow cross-country comparisons and contribute to the 
development of robust intervention strategies to promote dog walking across different countries.
Therefore the first aim of this study was to compare the physical activity of dog owners from UK population 
with people that do not own a dog. This study is superior to those previously conducted on dog walking in a 
number of ways. It uses both self-report and objective measures of physical activity, as people have a tendency 
to over-report physical activity on surveys. Research often focuses on one participant per household, potentially 
biased towards the person with the most involvement in dog care, inflating impact of dogs. In contrast, this study 
attempted to recruit and assess the PA of all household members, including children. Another unique aspect of 
this study was that all of the participants resided in the same community and thus had access to the same neigh-
bourhood environment for walking, known to influence activity levels20,21, although perhaps only in dog owners22. 
Therefore this is the first study of dog ownership to truly account for perceived differences in PA that may actually 
be attributed to dog owners living in different environments to people without a dog. A final novel aspect of this 
study is the methods of analysis used. Parametric linear regression methods are not strictly appropriate for analy-
sis of PA data, despite often being undertaken23. Our analysis methods address this issue, providing more accurate 
estimates of the effects of dog ownership. We hypothesised that dog owners (DO) would be more likely to meet 
PA guidelines than non-dog owners (NDO), and the effect sizes would be greater than reported previously (which 
were odds ratios (OR) less than 2)12,24. A secondary aim of the study was to investigate whether DO spend more or 
less time than NDO in more intensive PA than walking. We hypothesised that increased PA in dog owners would 
be additional to, and not replacing other forms of activity.
Results
Responses were received from 385 (55.2%) households with 694 (43.6%) participants (total household response 
rate 30.1% of study area (1280 households)). Sociodemographic descriptors of the adult participants are given in 
Table 1. There were slightly more female than males and participants were mainly middle-aged or older adults. 
Dog owners were significantly younger, more likely to work, had higher household gross income, slightly different 
education patterns, and had higher self-rated health (all P < 0.05).
Dog-related physical activity in adults. 
Dog owners walked with their dogs a median 7.0 times per week 
(range 0–32) and for a median 220.0 mins per week (range 0–1755). However, eighteen people (9.6%) who owned 
a dog reported 0 mins walking with their dog; excluding these non-dog walkers (NDW) increased the median 
time spent dog walking for dog walkers (DW) to 248 mins per week (range 10–1755). Dog walking was mostly 
done for recreation, health and fitness (median 210 mins per week, (range 0–1680) compared with 0 mins (range 
0–840) for transport); 33 dog owners (17.6%) reported walking their dogs for transport, 10 (5.3%) jogging with 
their dogs and 4 (2.1%) cycling with their dogs. Overall, dog owners spent a median 248 mins per week (range 
0–3100) participating in PA with their dog. Sixty-four percent of dog owners met the PA guidelines through their 
dog walking alone (71% of dog walkers).
Descriptive analysis unadjusted. 
Comparisons for self-reported PA outcomes in adults are presented 
in Table 2 ((NDO and DO) and (NDO, NDW and DW)). It is worth noting that NDW had very low levels of 
PA; only 29% of NDW met PA guidelines compared with over 80% of all DO, (88% of DW) and 62% of NDO 
(P < 0.001). Walking for recreation contributed a median of 67% of the total PA for dog owners compared to 
only 31% for those without a dog (P < 0.001). Dog owners were more likely to report jogging/running without a 
dog (P = 0.03) and less likely to report Yoga/Pilates (P = 0.03); see Table 3. No other differences in PA types were 
found.
Table 4 presents the unadjusted accelerometry findings for 28 adults (11 NDO and 17 DW). A non-significant 
but relevant effect size was found; dog walkers measured 2000 more steps and 13 more minutes of 
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day compared to non-owners (P = 0.34 and 0.37 respectively). Of the

six dog owners who reported walking with their dogs some days but not others, a mean 3010 extra steps per day 
(range 691–7236) were reported on dog walking days.
Multivariable modelling. 
The addition of weight status and perceived general health made very little dif-
ference to the model estimates so only the findings from model 1 are presented in Table 5. The odds of walking 
for transport was lower in DO compared with NDO (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.19–0.53), but if walking for transport 
occurred, there was no difference in the duration per week between NDO and DO. Dog owners were 14 times 
more likely than non-owners to walk for recreation (OR 14.35, 95% CI 5.77–35.79) and amongst people who 
walked for recreation, dog owners also walked for 39% more minutes per week (RR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.27–5.91). 
In contrast, there was no evidence that participation in other MVPA activities were more or less likely in dog 
owners, nor of longer or shorter duration per week if they were undertaken. Overall, The odds of DO meeting 
current physical activity guidelines of 150 mins per week were four times greater than for NDO (OR = 4.10, 95% 
CI 2.05–8.19). This represents an absolute difference of 87.3% of DO achieving 150 mins per week compared to 
62.7% of NDO. In all but two cases the self-report and objective measures provided the same outcome in terms 
of meeting guidelines. Two participants met guidelines by self-report but not accelerometry, 20 met guidelines by 
both measures, and 6 did not meet guidelines by accelerometry or self-report.
Dog-related physical activity in children. 
Children’s involvement in dog walking and unadjusted (due to 
small sample) children’s PA comparisons by dog ownership are presented in Table 6 (n = 46). The mean child age 
was 10.5 years; 24 children were male and 23 children were female. Two out of ten dog-owning children (5–15 yrs) 
reported never walking with their dog. Again, walking for transport was less common (median 0 mins per week) 
than walking for recreation (median 85 mins per week), dog walking median 105 mins per week in total. Children 
walked their dogs a median two times during the week (median of 40 mins total), and one time at the weekend 
(median of 45 mins total). Three children (30%) reported running/jogging with their dog. Free-time unstructured 
PA (eg. playing) with the dog by children was common, with a median 205 mins per week spent in this activity

(60 mins inside the house and 65 mins per week in the yard/garden). DO children reported 78 more minutes per 
week walking for recreation (P = 0.04), and 285 more minutes per week walking (P = 0.01) than NDO children. 
Free time unstructured PA (e.g playing) was also 260 mins higher in DO children (P < 0.01).
Discussion
The odds of dog owners meeting current physical activity guidelines were four times greater than for non-dog 
owners. This difference (OR 4) is more marked than differences reported in other countries (OR 1.6)12,24. Our 
findings are striking when compared to a meta-analysis of typical physical activity interventions in adults which 
have an effect size of 0.19 (across a variety of self-report and objective measures of PA), equating to just 496 steps 
per day25. Our study also suggests that children who own dogs report greater participation in recreational walking 
and free time physical activity. Given that dog owners did not appear to have lower participation in other forms 
of physical activity compared to non-owners, our findings suggest that that adult dog owners’ increased recre-
ational walking is contributing additional activity rather than replacing other activity. In fact, our data suggest 
dog owners are also more likely to participate in jogging or running without a dog than non-owners. Dog owners 
were less likely to report walking for transport than people without a dog, in line with previous studies26, but this 
was more than compensated for by additional recreational walking. Our novel approach to analysis elucidates 
that it is increased frequency of recreational walks, rather than considerably greater walk duration, explaining the 
principle effect of dog ownership on physical activity levels. These findings are important because guidelines rec-
ommend that activity should be frequent to break up periods of sedentary behaviour/sitting, and also undertaken 
in bouts of at least 10 minutes or more3; walking with a dog appears to be an effective strategy for facilitating this 
type of physical activity.

Our data confirms that people who own a dog but do not walk it (NDW) are much less physically active than 
both DW and NDO27. Only 10% of our owners reported no walking with their dog, compared to 22% in an 
Australian study using similar methodology24 and 30% in a USA study27, which likely contributes to our larger 
differences in odds of meeting physical activity guidelines. Another USA study found that only 27% of dog own-
ers walked their dog for at least 150 minutes per week7, compared with 64% in the current study. We conclude 
that dog walking is more important to the physical activity levels of our UK community than in other countries, 
but a proportion of dog owners who do not walk (NDW) are pervasive. This group also have very low levels of 
physical activity overall. Further research is required in order to understand why and if anything can be done 
to facilitate their participation in dog walking. Qualitative research into barriers and motivators to dog walking 
suggests it may be due to owner perception of owner or dog health capabilities11. However, looking at the small 
amount of data here, NDW perhaps have a tendency to be female, under 30 yrs, working, of normal weight and 
self-perceived very good health.
Our study has considerable strengths over previous research. We combined self-report with validation using 
objective measures of physical activity, in a standardised population living in the same area, and provided novel 
contextual information into the types of walking and physical activity done both with and without a dog. Analysis

methods were appropriate for interpretation of skewed outcomes23. We also collected data from multiple house-
hold members, including children, and adjusted for clustering in our analyses, demonstrating the feasibility of 
this approach. Thus the reliability of our findings is likely to be robust. However, the main limitation of this study 
is reliance on mainly self-report data (although validated measures), which could over-estimate activity levels. 
Findings also need to be confirmed in a larger sample and other populations. In particular, our accelerometry 
and child sample sizes were small. Studies of dog walking should collect both self-report and objective data, as 
accelerometry provides an objective measure of physical activity, whilst self-report provides more information on 
the context of the behaviour, i.e. walking for transport or recreation. Furthermore, as technology develops accel-
erometry could be combined with locational data such as GPS in order to also assess distance travelled. Finally, 
longitudinal studies are required to confirm causation – that dog acquisition results in increased physical activity, 
and that other activities are not replaced by dog walking.
In conclusion, this study provides new evidence that UK dog owners are considerably more active than people 
without a dog, and that dog walking is undertaken in addition to, and not instead of, other physical activities. Our 
study is cross-sectional in nature and cannot confirm that getting a dog causes people to be more active, although 
there is a small amount of longitudinal data which support this28,29. Nevertheless, the effect of dog ownership on 
physical activity levels in the UK appears to be greater than other countries studied. Our findings provide support 
for the role of pet dogs in promoting and maintaining positive health behaviours such as walking. Without dogs, 
it is likely that population physical activity levels would be much lower. Dog walking is also significant for wider 
health as physical activity undertaken outdoors and in natural environments has the greatest mental health ben-
efits30, and also increases social capital through encouraging interactions in local communities31. Therefore our 
pet dogs play an important role in keeping us healthy and this should be recognised and facilitated. However, this 
should not be interpreted as a recommendation for people to go out and get a dog purely for their own benefit; 
dog welfare needs must be carefully considered. Our findings should instead be used to justify the provision of 
dog-supportive environments for walking and pet-friendly housing; failure of planning and policy makers to 
provide these may significantly damage population levels of physical activity. Findings should also be used to 
promote interventions to increase and maintain dog walking, as even though many owners reported significant 
walking with their dog, there is still potential to increase this further. It is also important to understand how to 
support the maintenance of the activity levels of dog walkers, in particular regarding the perceived barriers of 
owner and dog health and ageing11.
Methods
Participants. 
The study population and survey methods have been outlined previously32. A community of 
1280 households in a semi-rural town in West Cheshire, UK, were approached up to five separate times at differ-
ent days of the week and times. Interviewers (female, personable veterinary students) spoke with members of 984 
households (76.9%) and for those who agreed to participate (767/77.9%), collected baseline data on household 
type, pets owned, and number of household members. Paper questionnaire surveys were then provided for each 
member of 698 households (91.0%), giving 1591 eligible participants. Participants were asked to either com-
plete and return them by post or online. Different questionnaires were issued for adults and children (5–15 yrs). 
Children less than 5 years old were not surveyed due to difficulties measuring PA reliably via questionnaire in this 
age group. A postcard reminder was sent after 2 weeks of non-return, and a second copy of the questionnaire at 4 
weeks. Survey participants were asked whether they would mind participating in further research and to provide 
contact details, and from this 88 people were also contacted at a later date by email/post/phone to be invited to 
wear an accelerometer for seven days.

received an information flyer detailing the study a week before. Participants consented by completing and return-
ing the questionnaires and for children ages 5–15 yrs, questionnaires were completed by the child and the parent 
together and posted back with the parent’s questionnaire, thus giving parental consent. The sub-sample provided 
informed written consent to wear the accelerometer.
Outcomes. 
Physical activity items were adapted slightly from the validated RESIDE Neighbourhood Physical 
Activity Questionnaire (NPAQ)33 and Dogs And Physical Activity (DAPA) Tool34, to separately measure the 
activities with a dog of walking for recreation, walking for transport, jogging, and cycling. In summary, all par-
ticipants (DO and NDO) indicated the frequency per usual week and total minutes per usual week that they 
engaged in walking for recreation and leisure (including for dog owners both with and without a dog), walking 
for transport (including for dog owners both with and without a dog), participation in other moderate intensity 
physical activities as defined, and other vigorous intensity physical activities as defined. The responses were used 
to calculate frequency and minutes dog-related physical activity, total walking, total recreational walking, total 
transport walking, MVPA, and total PA per week, as well as percentage contributions to total PA of the various 
components of walking.
Children’s PA questions were completed by the child with the parent and used a modified version (to include 
activities with and without dogs) of the questions used for children in the Child and Adolescent Physical Activity 
and Nutrition Survey (CAPANS)35. In brief, questions asked about frequency and total minutes spent in each 
activity type in a usual week (mon-fri), and weekend (sat-sun), undertaking: (a) walking without your dog for 
recreation, health or fitness; (b) walking without your dog for transport; (c) playing sport or structured physical 
activity; (d) free-time unstructured activity without your dog; (e) walking with your dog for recreation health or 
fitness; (f) Walking with a dog as a means of transport; (g) jogging or running with a dog; (h) free time activity 
with your dog in the backyard/garden; (i) free time activity with your dog inside the house; (j) other activity with 
your dog.
A subset of 31 adults and 3 children also wore Actigraph GTX3 accelerometers for 7 days within six months 
of completing surveys. The monitor was worn on the right hip during waking hours and recorded at 1 second 
epochs. Only adult data was further processed. Diaries were used to validate periods of non-wear. Valid data 
of at least 3 full days wear (1 weekend, 2 weekday, at least 500 mins per day) was available for n = 28 adults and 
activity intensities were classified by converting the data to 60 second epochs and then using validated cut points 
for adults36. From this an estimation of total time spent in PA for a 7 day week (minutes) was calculated. These 
data were used to classify whether or not the participant met guidelines of 150 minutes MVPA per week (yes/no) 
and this was then compared with the self-report survey data in order to highlight whether there was considerable 
over-reporting
Variables. 
Socio-demographic data collected included (see Table 1): house type; number of people in the 
household; children <16 present in household; current age of participant; gender; highest education level; occu-
pation; household income; dog ownership; marital status; work status; and PA at work. Other questions included: 
self-rated general health; height and weight (used to calculate BMI and categorise as normal, overweight or 
obese); Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI)37; social support from family and friends for walking33,38.
Statistical analysis. 
Simple descriptive analysis (from both self-report and accelerometry data) was con-
ducted using Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous outcomes, because the PA outcome data was highly skewed. 
We have also presented means and t-test findings for comparison because these are often presented in similar PA 
studies, despite not being appropriate due to non-normality of the data. Chi-squared tests were used to compare 
proportions between groups. Parametric linear regression methods are also not strictly appropriate for analysis of 
PA data, despite often being undertaken23. Due to zero-inflation in categories where a respondent often reported 
zero activity, simple transformation methods also did not normalise the data. To address this problem, two anal-
yses were conducted; (1) binary logistic regression was used to fit models with binary outcomes (ie whether or 
not that activity type was reported); and (2) where an activity was undertaken, linear regression on that subset of 
participants was used to fit models with the outcome measured as log10-transformed minutes of PA per week. 
This transformation was chosen to satisfy Normality of the model residuals, with coefficients interpreted as rel-
ative risks (RR) calculated for DO against NDO. This allowed comparison of the likelihood of an activity being 
undertaken at all (OR), and the duration per week the activity occurred if it was undertaken (RR interpreted as 
% difference in minutes). Due to non-independence of data, participants belonging to the same household were 
adjusted for using a random effect at the household level.
Univariable analyses were conducted to explore potential confounding of the relationships between measures 
of PA and dog ownership, to inform the model building process. All models included the independent variable 
of interest – dog ownership. Three levels of models were developed for each outcome (See Table 5); Model 1 – 
sociodemographic factors and social support factors identified through the univariable analysis and retained 
through backwards selection (gender was non-significant at P < 0.05 but deemed important to retain); Model 2 – 
addition of weight status; Model 3 – addition of self-reported general health. Models including weight status and 
self-reported perceived general health were tested due to the reasoning that being overweight or in poor health 
could be both a cause and outcome of low PA levels. Modelling was conducted in R v3.3.0 and the nlme R library.
