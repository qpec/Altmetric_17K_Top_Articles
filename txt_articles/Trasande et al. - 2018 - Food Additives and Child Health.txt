Our purposes with this policy statement and its accompanying technical 
report are to review and highlight emerging child health concerns related 
to the use of colorings, flavorings, and chemicals deliberately added to 
food during processing (direct food additives) as well as substances 
in food contact materials, including adhesives, dyes, coatings, paper, 
paperboard, plastic, and other polymers, which may contaminate food as 
part of packaging or manufacturing equipment (indirect food additives); 
to make reasonable recommendations that the pediatrician might be able 
to adopt into the guidance provided during pediatric visits; and to propose 
urgently needed reforms to the current regulatory process at the US Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) for food additives. Concern regarding food 
additives has increased in the past 2 decades, in part because of studies 
in which authors document endocrine disruption and other adverse health 
effects. In some cases, exposure to these chemicals is disproportionate 
among minority and low-income populations. Regulation and oversight of 
many food additives is inadequate because of several key problems in the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Current requirements for a “generally 
recognized as safe” (GRAS) designation are insufficient to ensure the 
safety of food additives and do not contain sufficient protections against 
conflict of interest. Additionally, the FDA does not have adequate authority to 
acquire data on chemicals on the market or reassess their safety for human 
health. These are critical weaknesses in the current regulatory system for 
food additives. Data about health effects of food additives on infants and 
children are limited or missing; however, in general, infants and children 
are more vulnerable to chemical exposures. Substantial improvements to 
the food additives regulatory system are urgently needed, including greatly 
strengthening or replacing the “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) 
determination process, updating the scientific foundation of the FDA’s safety 
assessment program, retesting all previously approved chemicals, and 
labeling direct additives with limited or no toxicity data.

POLICY STATEMENT

Downloaded from 
 INTRODUCTION
Today, more than 10 000 chemicals 
are allowed to be added to food 
and food contact materials in the 
United States, either directly or 
indirectly, under the 1958 Food 
Additives Amendment to the 1938 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (FFDCA) (public law number 
85-929). Many of these were 
grandfathered in for use by the 
federal government before the 
1958 amendment, and an estimated 
1000 chemicals are used under 
a “generally recognized as safe” 
(GRAS) designation process without 
US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) approval.1 Yet, suggested 
in accumulating evidence from 
nonhuman laboratory and human 
epidemiological studies is that 
chemicals used in food and food 
contact materials may contribute to 
disease and disability, as described  
in the accompanying technical  
report and summarized in Table 1.  
Children may be particularly 
susceptible to the effects of these 
compounds, given that they have 
higher relative exposures compared 
with adults (because of greater 
dietary intake per pound), their 
metabolic (ie, detoxification) systems 
are still developing, and key organ 
systems are undergoing substantial 
changes and maturation that are 
vulnerable to disruptions.2 In this 
policy statement and accompanying 
technical report, we will not 
address other contaminants that 
inadvertently enter the food and 
water supply, such as aflatoxins, 
polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, 
metals including mercury, pesticide 
residues such as DDT, and vomitoxin. 
In this statement, we will not focus 
on genetically modified foods, 
because they involve a separate 
set of regulatory and biomedical 
issues. Caffeine or other stimulants 
intentionally added to food products 
will not be covered.
The potential for endocrine system 
disruption is of great concern, 
especially in early life, when 
developmental programming of 
organ systems is susceptible to 
permanent and lifelong disruption. 
The international medical and 
scientific communities have called 
attention to these issues in several 
recent landmark reports, including 
a scientific statement from the 
Endocrine Society in 2009, 
42 which 
was updated in 2015 to reflect 
rapidly accumulating knowledge3; a 
joint report from the World Health 
Organization and United Nations 
Environment Program in 201343; and 
a statement from the International 
Federation of Gynecology and 
Obstetrics in 2015.44 Chemicals 
of increasing concern include the 
following:
 
• bisphenols, which are used in the 
lining of metal cans to prevent 
corrosion45;
 
• phthalates, which are esters of 
diphthalic acid that are often 
used in adhesives, lubricants, 
and plasticizers during the 
manufacturing process17;
 
• nonpersistent pesticides, which 
have been addressed in a previous 
policy statement from the 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
and, thus, will not be discussed in 
this statement46;
 
• perfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFCs), 
which are used in grease-proof 
paper and packaging47; and
 
• perchlorate, an antistatic agent 
used for plastic packaging in contact 
with dry foods with surfaces that 
do not contain free fat or oil and 
also present as a degradation 
product of bleach used to clean food 
manufacturing equipment.48
Additional compounds of concern 
discussed in the accompanying 
technical report include artificial food 
colors, nitrates, and nitrites.
Environmentally relevant doses  
(ie, low nanomolar concentrations 
that people are likely to encounter  
in daily life) of bisphenol A (BPA)4  
trigger the conversion of cells to 
adipocytes, 
9 disrupt pancreatic  
β-cell function in vivo, 
49 and affect 
glucose transport in adipocytes.9– 
11  
Phthalates are metabolized to 
chemicals that influence the 
expression of master regulators of 
lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, 
the peroxisome proliferator-activated 
 
receptors, 
21 with specific effects that 
produce insulin resistance

 in nonhuman laboratory studies. 
Some studies have documented 
similar metabolic effects in human 
populations.22 Some phthalates are  
well known to be antiandrogenic 
and can affect fetal reproductive 
development.18, 
19, 
 
50 Authors of recent 
 
studies have linked perfluoroalkyl 
chemicals with reduced immune 
response to vaccine27, 
 
28 and thyroid 
hormone alterations, 
29, 
51, 
 
52  
among other adverse health end 
points. Perchlorate is known to 
disrupt thyroid hormone34 and, 
along with exposures to other 
food contaminants, such as 
polybrominated diphenyl ethers, 
53 
–55 
may be contributing to the increase 
in neonatal hypothyroidism that 
has been documented in the United 
States.56 Artificial food colors may 
be associated with exacerbation 
of attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder symptoms.57 Nitrates and 
nitrites can interfere with thyroid 
hormone production40 and, under 
specific endogenous conditions, may 
result in the increased production of 
carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds.37, 
38
Racial and ethnic differences in 
food additive exposures are well 
documented.58, 
 
59 Higher urinary 
concentrations of BPA have been 
documented in African American 
individuals, 
60 and BPA concentrations 
have been inversely associated with 
family income.61 Given that obesity is 
well recognized to be more prevalent 
among low-income and minority 
children in the United States, 
62  
disproportionate exposures to 
obesogenic chemicals such as BPA 
partially explain sociodemographic 
disparities in health.
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR DIRECT 
AND INDIRECT FOOD ADDITIVES
The Food Additives Amendment of 
1958 was passed as an amendment to 
the FFDCA and was used to provide 
specific guidance for food additives. 
The legislation required a formal 
agency review, public comment, and 
open rulemaking process for new 
chemical additives. It also contained 
an exemption for common food 
additives, such as oil or vinegar, when 
used in ways that were GRAS.63 Under 
these specific scenarios, a formal 
rulemaking process was not required.
Despite this framework, there 
remain substantial gaps in data 
about potential health effects of food 
additives. A recent evaluation of 
3941 direct food additives revealed 
that 63.9% of these had no feeding 
data whatsoever (either a study of 
the lethal dose in 50% of animals or 
an oral toxicology study). Only 263 
(6.7%) had reproductive toxicology 
data, and 2 had developmental 
toxicology data.64
This lack of data on food additives 
stems from 2 critical problems within 
the food regulatory system. First, the 
GRAS process, although intended 
to be used in limited situations, 
has become the process by which 
virtually all new food additives enter 
the market. Consequently, neither 
the FDA nor the public have adequate 
notice or review. The Government 
Accountability Office conducted an 
extensive review of the FDA GRAS 
program in 2010 and determined 
that the FDA is not able to ensure the 
safety of existing or new additives 
through this approval mechanism.65 
Concerns also have been raised 
about conflicts of interest in the 
scientific review of food additives 
leading to GRAS designation. A recent 
evaluation of 451 GRAS evaluations 
voluntarily submitted to the FDA 
revealed that 22.4% of evaluations 
were made by an employee of the 
manufacturer, 13.3% were made 
by an employee of a consulting firm 
selected by the manufacturer, and 
64.3% were made by an expert panel 
selected by the consulting firm or 
manufacturer. None were made by a 
third party.66
Second, the FDA does not have 
authority to obtain data on or 
reassess the safety of chemicals 
already on the market.1 This issue is 
of great importance and concern for 
chemicals approved decades ago on 
the basis of limited and sometimes 
antiquated testing methods. For 
instance, some compounds, such as 
styrene and eugenol methyl ether, 
remain approved for use as flavoring 
agents, although they have been 
subsequently classified as reasonably 
anticipated to be human carcinogens 
by the US National Toxicology 
Program.67
Further compounding the problems 
noted above are other shortcomings 
within agency procedures. For 
example, the FDA does not regularly 
consider cumulative effects of 
food additives in the context of 
other chemical exposures that 
may affect the same biological 
receptor or mechanism, despite 
their legal requirement to do so.68 
– 
70 
Synergistic effects of chemicals found 
in foods are also not considered. 
Synergistic and cumulative effects 
are especially important, given that 
multiple food contaminants, such 
as polybrominated diphenyl ethers, 
perchlorate, and organophosphate 
pesticides, can disrupt various 
aspects of the thyroid hormone 
system.71 Dietary interactions may 
also be important, given that iodine 
sufficiency is essential for thyroid 
function.72
In addition, the FDA’s toxicological 
testing recommendations have 
not been updated on the basis of 
new scientific information. Testing 
guidelines for food contact materials 
are based on estimated dietary 
exposure, and only genotoxicity tests 
are recommended for exposures 
estimated to be less than 150 µg per 
person per day, regardless of body 
weight.73 Thus, toxicological testing 
may not account for behavioral or 
other end points that may be more 
likely to be impaired by early life 
exposures, especially to additives 
that act at low doses to disrupt 
endocrine pathways. Furthermore, 
these guidelines may not be 
adequately protective for children,

 given that they may receive higher 
relative doses than adults because of 
their lower body weights.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 
PEDIATRICIANS AND THE HEALTH 
SECTOR
It is difficult to know how to 
reduce exposures to many 
of these chemicals, but some 
recommendations are cited here.74 
– 
76 
Insofar as these modifications can 
pose additional costs, barriers 
may exist for low-income families 
to reduce their exposure to food 
additives of concern. Pediatricians 
may wish to tailor guidance in the 
context of practicality, especially 
because food insecurity remains a 
substantial child health concern. 
Pediatricians also can advocate for 
modernization of the FFDCA, as 
described in the subsequent section, 
which is of unique importance for 
low-income populations who may not 
be as readily able to reduce exposure 
to food additives.
 
• Prioritize consumption of fresh 
or frozen fruits and vegetables 
when possible, and support that 
effort by developing a list of low-
cost sources for fresh fruits and 
vegetables.
 
• Avoid processed meats, especially 
maternal consumption during 
pregnancy.
 
• Avoid microwaving food or 
beverages (including infant 
formula and pumped human milk) 
in plastic, if possible.
 
• Avoid placing plastics in the 
dishwasher.
 
• Use alternatives to plastic, such 
as glass or stainless steel, when 
possible.
 
• Look at the recycling code on the 
bottom of products to find the 
plastic type, and avoid plastics with 
recycling codes 3 (phthalates), 
6 (styrene), and 7 (bisphenols) 
unless plastics are labeled as 
“biobased” or “greenware, 
” 
indicating that they are made from 
corn and do not contain bisphenols.
 
• Encourage hand-washing before 
handling foods and/or drinks, and 
wash all fruits and vegetables that 
cannot be peeled.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY 
MAKERS
Just as the American Academy 
of Pediatrics had recommended 
principles for the modernization of 
the Toxic Substances Control Act 
(TSCA) to strengthen regulation 
of chemicals in nonfood products 
to protect children’s health, 
77 the 
Academy endorses previously 
described priority areas for 
improvements to the food additive 
regulatory program78 and provides 
additional recommendations below, 
some of which could be accomplished 
by the FDA, whereas others may 
require congressional action to 
change the current law.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GOVERNMENT
1. The GRAS process is in need 
of substantial revision. A more 
robust and transparent process 
of evaluation is needed, including 
additional requirements for 
toxicity testing before approval 
of chemicals for the marketplace. 
The GRAS system should be 
revised as soon as possible 
and should fully document and 
disclose conflicts of interest in the 
evaluation process.
2. The FDA should leverage expertise 
and technical evaluations from 
other agencies to gather missing 
data and identify knowledge gaps, 
while the current GRAS process 
remains in place.
3. The FDA should establish 
requirements for prioritization 
and retesting of previously 
approved chemicals.
4. Congress should provide the FDA 
authority to collect information 
about the use of food additives 
and to require additional data 
from the industry when gaps in 
knowledge and potential safety 
concerns are raised.
5. There should be dedicated 
resources for research and 
testing that will allow for a more 
effective evidence-based database 
to support a revised FDA safety 
review process.
6. The FDA should update the 
scientific foundation for the 
FDA safety assessment process, 
including but not limited to the 
following: expand the scope of 
recommended testing battery 
to cover endocrine-related 
and neurobehavioral effects, 
ensure adequate safety factors 
for pregnant and breastfeeding 
women and additional vulnerable 
populations, and develop 
strategies to integrate emerging 
testing techniques.
7. The FDA should consider 
cumulative and mixture effects 
from dietary sources, including 
other additives and contaminants 
that interact with relevant 
biological pathways.
8. The FDA should establish 
requirements for labeling of 
additives with limited or no 
toxicity data and those not 
reviewed for safety by the FDA.
9. The federal government should 
encourage provisions that ensure 
transparency and public access to 
information, including potential 
conflicts of interest.
The changes described above can 
be used to help restore public 
confidence in the safety of food 
additives. The FDA can and should 
make improvements within the 
scope of current agency authority. 
Ultimately, congressional action 
may be required to reform the food 
additives regulatory process. To 
aid in this process, the pediatrician 
community should come together
