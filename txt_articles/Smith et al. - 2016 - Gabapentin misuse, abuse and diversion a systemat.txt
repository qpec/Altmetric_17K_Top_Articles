Abstract
Background and Aims—Since its market release, gabapentin has been presumed to have no 
abuse potential and subsequently has been prescribed widely off-label, despite increasing reports 
of gabapentin misuse. This review estimates and describes the prevalence and effects of, 
motivations behind, and risk factors for gabapentin misuse, abuse, and diversion.
Methods—Databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles demonstrating gabapentin misuse, 
characterized by taking a larger dosage than prescribed or taking gabapentin without a 
prescription, and diversion. All types of studies were considered; grey literature was excluded. 
Thirty-three articles met inclusion criteria, consisting of 23 case studies and 11 epidemiological 
reports. Published reports came from the USA, the UK, Germany, Finland, India, South Africa, 
and France, and two analyzed websites not specific to a particular country.
Results—Prevalence of gabapentin misuse in the general population was reported to be 1%, 40–
65% among individuals with prescriptions, and between 15–22% within populations of people 
who abuse opioids. An array of subjective experiences reminiscent of opioids, benzodiazepines, 
and psychedelics were reported over a range of doses, including those within clinical 
recommendations. Gabapentin was primarily misused for recreational purposes, self-medication, 
or intentional self-harm and was misused alone or in combination with other substances, especially 
opioids, benzodiazepines, and/or alcohol. Individuals with histories of drug abuse were most often 
involved in its misuse.
Conclusions—Epidemiological and case report evidence suggests that the antiepileptic and 
analgesic medication gabapentin is being misused internationally at a rate of about 1%, with 
substance abuse populations at special risk for misuse/abuse.

Introduction
Gabapentin is an analog of GABA (1); however, it does not bind to GABAA or GABAB 
receptors (or benzodiazepine, opioid or cannabinoid receptors), but it can increase GABA 
and can decrease glutamate concentrations (2, 3). Its mechanisms of antiepileptic and 
analgesic actions are unknown, although some have speculated, in the case of the latter, that 
gabapentin may reduce the release of pain-related peptides and may decrease opioid-induced 
hyperalgesia (4). However, a unique gabapentin binding protein has been identified (5, 6) as 
a subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex (7), suggesting a less specific 
mechanism of action through modulation of neurosignaling.
Gabapentin was approved in 1993 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initially 
only for treatment of epilepsy as an adjunct to anticonvulsant therapy, but in 2004 was also 
approved as an analgesic for post-herpetic neuralgia (8). The European Medicines Agency 
approved gabapentin in 2006 for epilepsy and certain types of neuropathic pain (9) and the 
UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends gabapentin as a first-line 
treatment for all neuropathic pain (10). Because its mechanism of action is unclear and it is 
assumed to have no abuse potential, gabapentin is widely used off-label to treat an array of 
disorders, including insomnia, various neuropathic pain conditions, drug and alcohol 
addiction, anxiety, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, menopausal conditions, 
vertigo, pruritic disorders, and migraines. In fact, estimates of the off-label usage of 
gabapentin are reported to range from 83–95% of all gabapentin use (11, 12), which is 
estimated to account for over 90% of its sales (8). Due to illegal marketing (promoting off-
label uses) of gabapentin, Pfizer was fined $420 million after it was acquired from Warner-
Lambert (13).
Gabapentin is safely tolerated over a very broad range of doses from approximately 800–
1800 mg/day (although package inserts suggest that patients may be treated with doses as 
high as 3600 mg/day). In clinical practice, dosing is typically titrated starting from lower 
doses (i.e., <400 mg/day) and moving rapidly upward. The European Medicines Agency 
(14) and the Physician Prescribing Information generally recommends dosing up to 1800 mg 
in adults. While substantially higher doses have been tested in clinical trials, no additional 
clinical benefit has been observed (15). However, other studies have examined gabapentin as 
acute doses in the higher dose range, and it was well tolerated. At least one imaging study 
has reported that gabapentin (1200 and 2400 mg) significantly (and rapidly) increased 
measurable concentrations of brain gamma-aminobutryric acid (GABA), one of its presumed 
mechanisms of action (3). Hart and colleagues (2004) examined gabapentin (600 and 1200 
mg) for its potential to reduce the reinforcing effects of cocaine in the human laboratory 
(16). Their data reveal reductions in ratings of anxiety with both gabapentin doses (in the 
absence of cocaine) compared to placebo. Lile (2013) examined 600 and 1200 mg yielding 
significant differences from placebo on numerous outcomes, including liking, take again and

 good effects (17). Bisaga and Evans (2006) examined gabapentin in combination with 
alcohol at acute doses of 1000 and 2000 mg (18). In this dose range, gabapentin produced 
some direct effect on psychomotor function but was still safely tolerated in combination with 
alcohol.
Despite initial views that gabapentin had no abuse potential (19–23), there have been 
numerous published case reports of gabapentin abuse by substance abusers in the 
community and penal system (24–36). The purpose of this review is to describe the 
international scope of gabapentin abuse (i.e., prevalence, risk factors, motivations behind 
misuse, how it is misused, illicit value, effects experienced) and to identify implications for 
practice and future research.
Methods
Definitions
The definitions presented here were used to guide article selection and are used throughout 
the present article to facilitate discussion. Gabapentin refers to the capsules, tablets, and oral 
solutions of which gabapentin (1-(aminomethyl)cyclohexaneacetic acid) is the active 
ingredient. This definition includes the prodrug of gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil. When 
discussing case reports, the dose and formulation of gabapentin will be specified, when that 
information is available. Misuse is defined as the use of a drug in a manner or for a purpose 
other than indicated, including, but not limited to, taking another person’s medication, 
unprescribed or non-recommended route of administration, or a higher dosage than 
prescribed (37); thus, missing prescribed doses or dose reduction is not included. Abuse 
consists of persistent use of a drug despite negative consequences (37). Dependence refers to 
the physical and psychological elements associated with abuse, which include compulsion, 
withdrawal, and tolerance (37). Diversion is defined as the unauthorized selling or sharing of 
prescription medications, which can be either intentional (e.g., selling personal medication 
to someone without a prescription for that particular drug) or unintentional (e.g., theft). 
Diversion can occur at any point along the drug manufacturing and delivery process, 
however, at the core of this definition is unlawful movement of licit and regulated 
pharmaceuticals to the illicit marketplace (38, 39).
Search strategy and article selection
This review sought to identify peer-reviewed, published manuscripts describing cases of 
gabapentin misuse and/or abuse in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The databases 
PubMed, Web of Science (all databases), CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane were searched 
utilizing terms and strategies specific to each database (Appendix 1) developed in 
collaboration with a qualified librarian and peer-reviewed by two additional medical 
librarians. All searches were conducted between May and August 2015. Only those articles 
written in English that described occurrences of gabapentin misuse/abuse among human 
populations were included. Studies describing only gabapentin toxicity, withdrawal, or 
dependence without misuse/abuse were excluded, as were articles describing only pregabalin 
misuse/abuse. Grey literature, as defined by the Institute of Medicine (40), was excluded; a 
well-constructed preliminary examination in Google Scholar provided over 21,000 results,

 exclusion of which highlighted a vast body of evidence of gabapentin misuse. Snowball 
sampling (i.e., reviewing references of included papers) was then used to identify any 
additional articles that may have been excluded after applying index-based filters.
Data extraction was performed by the first author; all of the selected articles were reviewed 
by the second and third authors to assess whether they met inclusion criteria. Any 
disagreements regarding inclusion were discussed among all authors until agreement was 
reached.
Results
The initial search yielded 1,128 unique citations, of which 1,067 were excluded based on 
title or abstract (Figure 1). Sixty-one articles were read in their entirety to assess whether 
they met inclusion criteria. Twenty-eight were excluded because they did not actually 
describe gabapentin misuse, abuse, or diversion. The remaining 31 articles met all inclusion 
criteria. Snowball sampling identified 351 unique publications; 346 were excluded based on 
title or abstract, 2 met criteria and were included in the review. In total, this systematic 
review analyzed 33 articles. There were 47 case studies of gabapentin misuse/abuse found in 
23 published articles from 1993 to 2015 and 11 epidemiological reports published over the 
same time frame (one article described both types (41)). Notably, one review article was 
included in this paper not due to the content of the review, but rather a statement in the 
introduction, which mentioned a personal communication of large-scale gabapentin abuse 
occurring within a drug using population in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (26).
The present review attempted to summarize rigorously conducted and well-presented 
findings on gabapentin misuse/abuse. As such, the quality of case reports could not be 
evaluated; therefore, this presentation focused on epidemiological and toxicological studies 
using case studies as secondary data. It would be detrimental to have excluded case reports, 
as they provide rich context from which the population data may arise. Therefore, unless 
clearly noted in the manuscript text that the article was a case report, the reader could 
assume that the study was sample-based.
Study base and data sources
The 11 epidemiological studies (all cross-sectional) selected for this analysis obtained data 
from unique sources (Table 1); four publications involved substance misuse/abuse 
populations (42–45), two examined toxicology records (41, 46), one used a population-based 
sample (47), two involved reports to a poison center (48, 49), and two analyzed websites 
with qualitative information regarding gabapentin abuse (50, 51).
Over half of the case report articles (n=14) arose from patients presenting to a hospital or 
general clinic with overdose or withdrawal-like symptoms (24, 25, 29, 33, 34, 36, 52–59); 
two came from substance abuse clinics (26, 31), three from psychiatric facilities (27, 28, 35), 
two from the penal system (30, 32), one from postmortem toxicology findings (60), and one 
from poison center reports (49).

 Demographic and geographical distribution
Five epidemiology/toxicology papers provided demographic characteristics of their sample. 
Two toxicology studies using poison center data indicated slightly higher representation of 
females (60–65%) (48, 49), while another study among opioid dependent patients found no 
significant difference in representation by gender (51% male, p=0.58)(45). One article noted 
that females were significantly more likely to misuse gabapentin than males in a cohort of 
opioid users (percent difference=17.3%, 95% confidence interval=10.4–24.6%) (44). A 
toxicology paper by Peterson (2009) observed no difference in gender in the likelihood of 
being a positive gabapentin driving impairment case (50% male)(41). Among case studies, 
males had slightly higher representation than females (15 males vs. 13 females), although 
gender was incompletely specified in two reports (31, 49). The mean age of samples ranged 
between 21 and 43 in studies in which it was reported (41, 45, 46, 48, 49). The calculated 
mean age of case reports was 41.
Published reports came from the United States (67%, n=22), the United Kingdom (12%, 
n=4), Germany (3%, n=1), Finland (3%, n=1), India (3%, n=1), South Africa (3%, n=1), 
France (3%, n=1), and two analyzed websites not specific to a particular country (6%). 
While all of the articles in this review described gabapentin misuse/abuse, 12 (36%) were 
documented reports of overdose involving gabapentin (24, 25, 33, 48, 49, 53–57, 59, 60).
Misuse and abuse of gabapentin
Prevalence—Only one article gave an estimate of lifetime prevalence of gabapentin abuse 
in the general population; Kapil and colleagues (2013) surveyed a UK population-based 
sample of 1500 and found that 1.1% reported ever misusing gabapentin (47).
Over half of the studies described gabapentin misuse that occurred among samples with a 
history of or current substance misuse/abuse/dependence (n=6), the majority of which 
discussed opioid misuse, specifically (n=5). Smith (2012) and Baird (2013) gave reports of 
gabapentin misuse within Scottish populations that attended substance misuse clinics, which 
likely included individuals who abuse alcohol and/or drugs (42, 43). Recent cross-sectional 
studies of opioid abuse samples in the US and UK estimated gabapentin misuse to be 
between 15–22% (42, 44, 45) and gabapentin abuse with a prescription ranged from 40–65% 
(44, 45, 47, 49). There was little evidence of gabapentin abuse among those with a positive 
history of alcohol abuse or dependence. In fact, Wilens and colleagues (2015) conducted a 
survey among opioid dependent individuals seeking substance detoxification in the US and 
found no gabapentin abuse among those undergoing alcohol detoxification (45). Conversely, 
for opioid dependent patients, 40% reported using more gabapentin than prescribed and 13% 
reported using unprescribed gabapentin (45).
In Scotland in 2010, approximately 1% of all drug-related deaths were directly attributed to 
gabapentin (42). Further, two articles assessed toxicological results in primarily substance 
misusing populations; the first examined 23,479 impaired driving cases in the US and found 
gabapentin was involved in 0.6% of them (41), while a Finnish study reviewed 13,766 
medico-legal postmortem investigations and identified gabapentin in 0.3% of the cases (46).

 Doses, Cost, and Diversion—Studies indicate gabapentin is misused/abused over a 
wide range of doses, from within therapeutic range (900–3600 mg/day) to supratherapeutic 
doses. All but two articles discussed the dosage involved in gabapentin misuse (42, 47). 
Evidence from the US suggested that gabapentin misuse among individuals with 
prescriptions for gabapentin involved a higher amount than prescribed (45, 46, 61). For 
example, as previously mentioned, a US study found that 22% of a sample of 162 opioid-
dependent patients had a prescription for gabapentin, of which 40% indicated they used 
more than prescribed (45). Potential explanations for this trend are tolerance and addiction 
as described in two clinical case discussions from France and the US, respectively (27, 36). 
Interestingly, according to American and European case reports, those who used gabapentin, 
but did not have a prescription for it, often took doses that fell within clinical guidelines, 
regardless of motivations behind use, though the doses were not spread out over the course 
of a day and it was unclear how often an individual dosed per day (31, 34).
Over half of the articles (n=7) mentioned or referred to diversion of gabapentin. Studies in 
the UK and US identified health services/physicians as one of the major sources of misused 
gabapentin, with rates ranging from 52–63% (the 63% also may include baclofen and 
pregabalin) (44, 47). Other sources included family or acquaintances, Internet, bought 
abroad (47), and drug dealers (44).
Case reports support these findings from epidemiological studies. Reports from India, the 
UK and US also identify family members or acquaintances as gabapentin sources. Behaviors 
that are markers of abuse liability, such as doctor shopping, exaggeration of symptoms, and 
fabrication of prescriptions, were reported in case studies from France and the US (31, 36). 
Due to widespread gabapentin abuse in a US correctional facility, Reccoppa and colleagues 
(2004) inventoried dispensed medications and found only 19 of 96 prescriptions in the 
possession of the inmate receiving the prescription (30).
There is a street market demand for gabapentin. An American case study stated that, 
“{gabapentin} tablets were sometimes sold or traded for illicit drugs” (31). In Scotland, the 
Drug and Crime Enforcement Agency identified the growing use of gabapentin as a cutting 
agent in heroin (43). In the UK and US, epidemiological studies reported the illicit market 
value for gabapentin ranged from <1–7 USD per pill depending on strength (42–44).
Combination with other substances—Three toxicology studies elucidated the most 
commonly found substances with gabapentin. The first, by Häkkinen and colleagues (2014), 
examined Finnish postmortem toxicological samples positive for gabapentin from 2010–
2011 and found that all cases classified as gabapentin abuse also involved the use of alcohol 
and/or opioids (most commonly buprenorphine and tramadol) (46). Peterson (2009) 
conducted a study in the US, also utilizing toxicological data, which examined the presence 
of gabapentin in driving impairment cases. Only 7% of gabapentin-positive blood samples 
detected solely gabapentin; the remainder were polysubstance cases, with benzodiazepines 
(44%), opioids (43%), antidepressants (43%), other CNS depressants (e.g., trazodone, 
zolpidem; 36%), antiepileptics (25%), cannabinoids (15%), stimulants (11%), and ethanol 
(6%) (41). Smith and colleagues (2012) stated that postmortem toxicology reports in 
Scotland revealed 75% of those identifying gabapentin also included morphine and/or

 methadone, which the authors said may be indicative of recent opioid dependence (43). The 
toxicology studies, while helpful for providing a picture of what classes of medicines were 
commonly found in combination with gabapentin, did not address unprescribed mixing of 
licit or illicit drugs.
Alternatively, several epidemiological studies did identify simultaneous combination of 
gabapentin with other substances for the explicit purpose of misusing them. One article 
discussed the misuse of gabapentin in combination with buprenorphine for the purpose of 
“getting high” (44). Similarly, Baird and colleagues (2014) stated that 38% of a substance 
misuse sample in Scotland took gabapentin (and/or pregabalin) in combination with 
prescribed methadone to potentiate the effects of methadone (42).
Studies in US and UK substance abuse populations, by Smith (2015) and Smith (2012) 
respectively, identified a greater likelihood for those misusing gabapentin to also be 
misusing prescription opioids (43, 44). Smith (2015) also found that individuals who 
reported using gabapentin to get “high” were also more likely to be misusing 
benzodiazepines (44), which supports the finding by Peterson (2009; discussed earlier) that 
benzodiazepines were the most commonly detected class of drugs in combination with 
gabapentin (41).
Use of gabapentin and ethanol were commonly reported together; in addition to the two 
toxicology studies discussed earlier (41, 46), another mentioned the misuse of gabapentin in 
combination with alcohol (50). An international review of recreational gabapentin misuse 
anecdotes described other substances that have been reported in conjunction with misused 
gabapentin including cannabis, SSRIs, LSD, amphetamine, and GHB (gamma-
Hydroxybutyric acid) (50).
Case studies have corroborated the epidemiological findings and have also identified 
buprenorphine/naloxone and quetiapine as combinations of abuse with gabapentin (31, 32, 
51).
Motives—A variety of motivations behind gabapentin misuse were identified, many that 
related to substance abuse behaviors in general, which included: recreational use (42–44, 
50), control mood and/or anxiety (41), potentiate the effects of drug abuse treatment (42), 
and intentional self harm (49). Case reports substantiated those intentions (25, 27–35, 51, 
53, 57, 59, 60), and also identified the following: pain (52), reduce cravings for/manage 
withdrawal from other drugs (28, 29, 35), substitute for other drugs (28, 31, 32), and 
addicted to gabapentin (27, 36).
Effects Experienced—Only three epidemiological studies mentioned the effects sought 
by misusing gabapentin (42, 43, 50); these findings were not presented as inference from a 
sample, rather examples accumulated from individual reporting. Six case reports also 
described feelings achieved from gabapentin misuse/abuse (28–32, 35). Therefore, the two 
types of articles were combined in this section to provide a comprehensive catalog of 
individual effects experienced and consequently should be interpreted with caution.

 Several case studies mentioned experiencing euphoria after gabapentin misuse that was 
reminiscent of, but not as strong as, opioids (31, 32, 35). This feeling was achieved in 
combination with other drugs (e.g., buprenorphine/naloxone, methadone, baclofen, 
quetiapine, alcohol) (31, 32, 42, 50) as well as by using gabapentin alone (35, 43), in 
dosages ranging from 1500–12000 mg, though only three articles give actual amounts 
misused (31, 32, 35). One case study described individuals snorting gabapentin powder from 
capsules and experiencing a high similar to that felt after snorting cocaine (30). Another 
commonly reported sensation from gabapentin misuse was sedation/relaxation/calmness, 
which was described in six studies (28, 29, 31, 32, 43, 50). As with euphoria achieved from 
gabapentin misuse, sedation/relaxation/calmness was experienced in combination with other 
substances (e.g., quetiapine, alcohol, cannabis, buprenorphine/naloxone) (29, 31, 32) or by 
taking gabapentin alone (28, 50), and over a range of dosages (e.g., 600–4800 mg). Other 
effects experienced included: improved sociability (43, 50), marijuana-like “high” (43, 50), 
cocaine-like “high” (30), “amphetamine rush” (50), disassociation (50), MDMA-like “high” 
(50), increased energy and focus (35), improved quality of sleep (35), and becoming more 
talkative (50).
Discussion
Gabapentin has been presumed to have no abuse potential historically (19–23), however, this 
review reports evidence to the contrary. Of the 11 population-based studies and 23 case 
reports included here, nearly one-third report gabapentin misuse/abuse for recreational 
purposes and epidemiological studies from the US and UK estimate abuse rates between 40–
65% just among individuals with a gabapentin prescription. Studies from the UK indicate 
that gabapentin has developed a prominent place as a drug of abuse; in Scottish prisons, 
gabapentin is among the top-requested prescription drugs of abuse (42). However, the rise in 
popularity of recreationally used gabapentin is occurring in the US, as well. Smith and 
colleagues (2015) describe a near 3000% increase in the use of gabapentin to get “high” 
from 2008 to 2014 among a cohort of 503 prescription drug users in the Central Appalachian 
region of the US (44).
Motivations for misused gabapentin can be classified largely into three basic categories: 
recreational (e.g., get high or substitute for more expensive drugs), self-harm, and self-
medication (e.g., for pain or withdrawal symptoms from other substances). The majority of 
case reports involved individuals who had prescriptions for gabapentin, but took higher 
dosages than they were prescribed. Descriptive reports on gabapentin reveal an array of 
subjective experiences evocative of opioids (e.g., euphoria, talkativeness, increased energy, 
sedation), benzodiazepines (e.g., sedation), and psychedelics (e.g., dissociation). These 
effects do not appear to be specific to a particular dose and may occur well within the 
therapeutic range. No pattern was observed in terms of dose taken or interactions between 
dose and motive or dose and effects achieved, which may be partially explained by the 
unpredictable pharmacokinetics and non-linear bioavailability of gabapentin (62). To date, 
no carefully controlled human laboratory studies have been published that sought to examine 
and characterize the abuse potential profile of gabapentin in comparison to other prototypic 
drugs of abuse. Overall, further empirical research is clearly needed to better evaluate and

 characterize gabapentin psychopharmacology and the risks associated with gabapentin use, 
especially among those using it recreationally.
It is difficult to ascertain risk factors for gabapentin misuse/abuse except history of or 
current drug abuse, particularly opioids, is likely one from reports available to date. While 
no studies to date have formally assessed a history of or current substance abuse (especially 
drug abuse) as a risk factor for gabapentin misuse, it was the most common characteristic 
detected here. This is particularly important because it indicates that the increasing trend in 
gabapentin abuse, notably among populations with opioid misuse, has the potential to affect 
an estimated 0.6–0.8% of the world’s population aged 15–64 that has used opioids in the 
past year (63). It is important to note, however, that this review may overrepresent 
individuals who have abused substances, illustrating the importance of examining 
gabapentin misuse in the general population. Further, grey literature was excluded, which 
may have provided more information from which to infer risk factors for misuse, along with 
other characteristics of gabapentin misuse/abuse. Still, the present review emphasizes the 
paucity of peer-reviewed research on this important emerging topic, and provides key 
starting points for subsequent examination.
Gabapentin is relatively inexpensive and, in fact, many individuals can acquire it for free or 
a drastically reduced price under subsidy plans (64–66). Further, due to its widespread off-
label prescribing worldwide (8, 11, 12), it is relatively easy to receive gabapentin by 
prescription, as illustrated by physicians and the health care system being the primary source 
of misused gabapentin in the US and UK. These factors have enabled the market to be 
flooded with gabapentin and it has been referred to among the drug using population as “a 
cheap man’s high” (personal communication). It is important that prescribers recognize the 
current diversion of gabapentin and dispense judiciously.
Gabapentin requires a prescription, but generally has no additional controls (66–69); 
however, pregabalin, its close structural relative, which was approved after gabapentin, was 
placed into Schedule V (abuse potential) in the US (70) and included in the European 
Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA)-Europol annual report on 
new psychoactive substances of abuse (71). It was found that pregabalin had euphoric and 
sedative properties similar to other frequently abused substances; moreover, as it is known 
that tolerance and physical dependence (with withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation) 
may occur in response to repeated dosing, these factors may contribute to the escalation or 
continued misuse of gabapentin in those abusing the drug for its psychoactive effects (72). 
Our review, and other non-abuse reports falling outside the scope of this study (73–79), 
identified that gabapentin, too, produces these effects (i.e., tolerance, physical dependence, 
and withdrawal) thereby warranting reevaluation of its abuse potential. However, it is 
important to consider in reexamination that gabapentin may be an appropriate treatment for 
many individuals (e.g., those in alcohol withdrawal, chronic pain, epilepsy) that may face 
impediments to receiving their medication upon increased control. Therefore, a risk-benefit 
analysis is necessary prior to any abuse potential labeling.
From published reports presented here, gabapentin is most often misused in combination 
with other substances, especially opioids, benzodiazepines, and alcohol, although details in

 this area are sparse and necessitate systematic data collection and analysis. Concomitant use 
is particularly important because gabapentin is often co-prescribed with opioids, and pain 
patients often receive prescriptions for benzodiazepines due to anxiety and/or difficulty 
sleeping. Moreover, its uncontrolled status leads doctors to believe that it lacks abuse 
potential; thus, they may feel confident in their prescribing of gabapentin to patients with 
substance use histories. NHS England released advice for gabapentin prescribers that 
strongly recommends using it as approved, offering alternative interventions for conditions 
outside the licensing indications (69). Finally, benzodiazepines have been used to treat 
delirium resulting from gabapentin withdrawal (29) and gabapentin has been used to treat 
withdrawal from both benzodiazepines (80) and alcohol (19, 21). These findings suggest that 
these three agents may share a common neuropharmacological pathway for abuse and 
dependence; however, further research is necessary to explore this hypothesis.
In summary, findings from the present review suggest that gabapentin is misused/abused 
internationally for recreation, self-medication, or self-harm, with an array of subjective 
experiences. Substance abuse populations, especially individuals with a history of or current 
opioid misuse, appear to be at particular risk for misuse/abuse. Further studies to identify 
risk factors for gabapentin misuse and to characterize gabapentin’s abuse liability are 
recommended.
