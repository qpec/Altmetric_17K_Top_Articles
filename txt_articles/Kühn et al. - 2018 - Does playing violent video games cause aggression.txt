Abstract
It is a widespread concern that violent video games promote aggression, reduce pro-social behaviour, increase impulsivity
and interfere with cognition as well as mood in its players. Previous experimental studies have focussed on short-term effects
of violent video gameplay on aggression, yet there are reasons to believe that these effects are mostly the result of priming.
In contrast, the present study is the first to investigate the effects of long-term violent video gameplay using a large battery of
tests spanning questionnaires, behavioural measures of aggression, sexist attitudes, empathy and interpersonal competencies,
impulsivity-related constructs (such as sensation seeking, boredom proneness, risk taking, delay discounting), mental health
(depressivity, anxiety) as well as executive control functions, before and after 2 months of gameplay. Our participants played
the violent video game Grand Theft Auto V, the non-violent video game The Sims 3 or no game at all for 2 months on a
daily basis. No significant changes were observed, neither when comparing the group playing a violent video game to a
group playing a non-violent game, nor to a passive control group. Also, no effects were observed between baseline and
posttest directly after the intervention, nor between baseline and a follow-up assessment 2 months after the intervention
period had ended. The present results thus provide strong evidence against the frequently debated negative effects of playing
violent video games in adults and will therefore help to communicate a more realistic scientific perspective on the effects of
violent video gaming.
The concern that violent video games may promote
aggression or reduce empathy in its players is pervasive and
given the popularity of these games their psychological
impact is an urgent issue for society at large. Contrary to the
custom, this topic has also been passionately debated in the
scientific literature. One research camp has strongly argued
that violent video games increase aggression in its players
[1, 2], whereas the other camp [3, 4] repeatedly concluded
that the effects are minimal at best, if not absent. Impor-
tantly, it appears that these fundamental inconsistencies
cannot be attributed to differences in research methodology
since even meta-analyses, with the goal to integrate the
results of all prior studies on the topic of aggression caused
by video games led to disparate conclusions [2, 3]. These
meta-analyses had a strong focus on children, and one of
them [2] reported a marginal age effect suggesting that
children might be even more susceptible to violent video
game effects.
To unravel this topic of research, we designed a rando-
mised controlled trial on adults to draw causal conclusions
on the influence of video games on aggression. At present,
almost all experimental studies targeting the effects of
violent video games on aggression and/or empathy focussed
on the effects of short-term video gameplay. In these studies
the duration for which participants were instructed to
play the games ranged from 4 min to maximally 2 h
(mean = 22 min, median = 15 min, when considering all
experimental studies reviewed in two of the recent major
meta-analyses in the field [3, 5]) and most frequently the

 effects of video gaming have been tested directly after
gameplay.
It has been suggested that the effects of studies focussing
on consequences of short-term video gameplay (mostly
conducted on college student populations) are mainly the
result of priming effects, meaning that exposure to violent
content increases the accessibility of aggressive thoughts
and affect when participants are in the immediate situation
[6].
However,
above
and
beyond
this
the
General
Aggression Model (GAM, [7]) assumes that repeatedly
primed thoughts and feelings influence the perception of
ongoing events and therewith elicits aggressive behaviour
as a long-term effect. We think that priming effects
are
interesting
and
worthwhile
exploring,
but
in
contrast to the notion of the GAM our reading of the
literature is that priming effects are short-lived (suggested
to only last for <5 min and may potentially reverse after
that time [8]). Priming effects should therefore only play a
role in very close temporal proximity to gameplay.
Moreover, there are a multitude of studies on college
students that have failed to replicate priming effects [9–11]
and associated predictions of the so-called GAM such as a
desensitisation against violent content [12–14] in adoles-
cents and college students or a decrease of empathy [15]
and pro-social behaviour [16, 17] as a result of playing
violent video games.
However, in our view the question that society is
actually interested in is not: “Are people more aggressive
after having played violent video games for a few minutes?
And are these people more aggressive minutes after
gameplay ended?”, but rather “What are the effects of fre-
quent, habitual violent video game playing? And for how
long do these effects persist (not in the range of minutes but
rather weeks and months)?” For this reason studies are
needed in which participants are trained over longer periods
of time, tested after a longer delay after acute playing
and tested with broader batteries assessing aggression
but also other relevant domains such as empathy as
well as mood and cognition. Moreover, long-term follow-up
assessments are needed to demonstrate long-term effects of
frequent violent video gameplay. To fill this gap, we set out
to
expose
adult
participants
to
two
different
types
of video games for a period of 2 months and investigate
changes in measures of various constructs of interest
at least one day after the last gaming session and
test them once more 2 months after the end of the
gameplay intervention. In contrast to the GAM, we
hypothesised no increases of aggression or decreases in
pro-social behaviour even after long-term exposure to a
violent video game due to our reasoning that priming effects
of violent video games are short-lived and should therefore
not influence measures of aggression if they are not
measured directly after acute gaming. In the present study,
we assessed potential changes in the following domains:
behavioural
as
well
as
questionnaire
measures
of
aggression,
empathy
and
interpersonal
competencies,
impulsivity-related constructs (such as sensation seeking,
boredom proneness, risk taking, delay discounting), and
depressivity and anxiety as well as executive control
functions. As the effects on aggression and pro-social
behaviour were the core targets of the present study, we
implemented
multiple
tests
for
these
domains.
This
broad range of domains with its wide coverage and the
longitudinal nature of the study design enabled us to draw
more general conclusions regarding the causal effects of
violent video games.
Materials and methods
Participants
Ninety healthy participants (mean age = 28 years, SD =
7.3, range: 18–45, 48 females) were recruited by means of
flyers and internet advertisements. The sample consisted of
college students as well as of participants from the general
community. The advertisement mentioned that we were
recruiting for a longitudinal study on video gaming, but did
not mention that we would offer an intervention or that we
were expecting training effects. Participants were randomly
assigned to the three groups ruling out self-selection effects.
The sample size was based on estimates from a previous
study with a similar design [18]. After complete description
of the study, the participants’ informed written consent was
obtained. The local ethics committee of the Charité Uni-
versity Clinic, Germany, approved of the study. We inclu-
ded participants that reported little, preferably no video
game usage in the past 6 months (none of the participants
ever played the game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA) or Sims 3
in any of its versions before). We excluded participants with
psychological or neurological problems. The participants
received financial compensation for the testing sessions
(200 Euros) and performance-dependent additional payment
for two behavioural tasks detailed below, but received no
money for the training itself.
Training procedure
The violent video game group (5 participants dropped out
between pre- and posttest, resulting in a group of n = 25,
mean age = 26.6 years, SD = 6.0, 14 females) played
the game Grand Theft Auto V on a Playstation 3 console
over a period of 8 weeks. The active control group played
the non-violent video game Sims 3 on the same console
(6 participants dropped out, resulting in a group of
n = 24, mean age = 25.8 years, SD = 6.8, 12 females). The
S. Kühn et al.
 passive control group (2 participants dropped out, resulting
in a group of n = 28, mean age = 30.9 years, SD = 8.4, 12
females) was not given a gaming console and had no task
but underwent the same testing procedure as the two
other groups. The passive control group was not aware of
the fact that they were part of a control group to
prevent self-training attempts. The experimenters testing
the
participants
were
blind
to
group
membership,
but
we
were
unable
to
prevent
participants
from
talking about the game during testing, which in some cases
lead
to
an
unblinding
of
experimental
condition.
Both training groups were instructed to play the game
for
at
least
30 min
a
day.
Participants
were
only
reimbursed for the sessions in which they came to the lab.
Our previous research suggests that the perceived fun in
gaming was positively associated with training outcome
[18] and we speculated that enforcing training sessions
through
payment
would
impair
motivation
and
thus
diminish the potential effect of the intervention. Participants
underwent a testing session before (baseline) and after the
training period of 2 months (posttest 1) as well as a follow-
up testing sessions 2 months after the training period
(posttest 2).
Grand Theft Auto V (GTA)
GTA is an action-adventure video game situated in a
fictional highly violent game world in which players are
rewarded for their use of violence as a means to advance in
the game. The single-player story follows three criminals
and their efforts to commit heists while under pressure from
a government agency. The gameplay focuses on an
open world (sandbox game) where the player can choose
between different behaviours. The game also allows the
player to engage in various side activities, such as
action-adventure, driving, third-person shooting, occasional
role-playing,
stealth
and
racing
elements.
The
open
world design lets players freely roam around the fictional
world so that gamers could in principle decide not to
commit violent acts.
The Sims 3 (Sims)
Sims is a life simulation game and also classified as a
sandbox game because it lacks clearly defined goals. The
player creates virtual individuals called “Sims”, and custo-
mises their appearance, their personalities and places them
in a home, directs their moods, satisfies their desires and
accompanies them in their daily activities and by becoming
part of a social network. It offers opportunities, which the
player may choose to pursue or to refuse, similar as GTA
but is generally considered as a pro-social and clearly non-
violent game.
Assessment battery
To assess aggression and associated constructs we used the
following questionnaires: Buss–Perry Aggression Ques-
tionnaire [19], State Hostility Scale [20], Updated Illinois
Rape Myth Acceptance Scale [21, 22], Moral Disengage-
ment Scale [23, 24], the Rosenzweig Picture Frustration Test
[25, 26] and a so-called World View Measure [27]. All of
these measures have previously been used in research
investigating the effects of violent video gameplay, how-
ever, the first two most prominently. Additionally, beha-
vioural
measures
of
aggression
were
used:
a
Word
Completion Task, a Lexical Decision Task [28] and the
Delay frustration task [29] (an inter-correlation matrix is
depicted in Supplementary Figure 1). From these beha-
vioural measures, the first two were previously used in
research on the effects of violent video gameplay. To assess
variables that have been related to the construct of impul-
sivity, we used the Brief Sensation Seeking Scale [30] and
the Boredom Propensity Scale [31] as well as tasks assessing
risk taking and delay discounting behaviourally, namely the
Balloon Analogue Risk Task [32] and a Delay-Discounting
Task [33]. To quantify pro-social behaviour, we employed:
Interpersonal Reactivity Index [34] (frequently used in
research on the effects of violent video gameplay), Balanced
Emotional Empathy Scale [35], Reading the Mind in the
Eyes test [36], Interpersonal Competence Questionnaire [37]
and Richardson Conflict Response Questionnaire [38]. To
assess depressivity and anxiety, which has previously been
associated with intense video game playing [39], we used
Beck Depression Inventory [40] and State Trait Anxiety
Inventory [41]. To characterise executive control function,
we used a Stop Signal Task [42], a Multi-Source Inter-
ference Task [43] and a Task Switching Task [44] which
have all been previously used to assess effects of video
gameplay. More details on all instruments used can be found
in the Supplementary Material.
Data analysis
On the basis of the research question whether violent video
game playing enhances aggression and reduces empathy,
the focus of the present analysis was on time by group
interactions. We conducted these interaction analyses
separately, comparing the violent video game group against
the active control group (GTA vs. Sims) and separately
against the passive control group (GTA vs. Controls) that
did not receive any intervention and separately for the
potential changes during the intervention period (baseline
vs. posttest 1) and to test for potential long-term changes
(baseline vs. posttest 2). We employed classical frequentist
statistics running a repeated-measures ANOVA controlling
for the covariates sex and age.

conduced four different tests with each (GTA vs. Sims,
GTA vs. Controls, crossed with baseline vs. posttest 1,
baseline vs. posttest 2), we had to conduct 52 × 4 = 208
frequentist statistical tests. Setting the alpha value to 0.05
means that by pure chance about 10.4 analyses should
become significant. To account for this multiple testing
problem and the associated alpha inflation, we conducted a
Bonferroni correction. According to Bonferroni, the critical
value for the entire set of n tests is set to an alpha value of
0.05 by taking alpha/n = 0.00024.
Since the Bonferroni correction has sometimes been
criticised as overly conservative, we conducted false dis-
covery rate (FDR) correction [45]. FDR correction also
determines adjusted p-values for each test, however, it
controls only for the number of false discoveries in
those tests that result in a discovery (namely a significant
result).
Moreover, we tested for group differences at the baseline
assessment using independent t-tests, since those may
hamper the interpretation of significant interactions between
group and time that we were primarily interested in.
Since the frequentist framework does not enable to
evaluate whether the observed null effect of the hypothe-
sised interaction is indicative of the absence of a relation
between violent video gaming and our dependent variables,
the amount of evidence in favour of the null hypothesis has
been tested using a Bayesian framework. Within the
Bayesian framework both the evidence in favour of the null
and the alternative hypothesis are directly computed based
on the observed data, giving rise to the possibility of
comparing the two. We conducted Bayesian repeated-
measures ANOVAs comparing the model in favour of the
null and the model in favour of the alternative hypothesis
resulting in a Bayes factor (BF) using Bayesian Information
criteria [46]. The BF01 suggests how much more likely the
data is to occur under the null hypothesis. All analyses were
performed using the JASP software package (https://jasp-sta
ts.org).
Results
Sex distribution in the present study did not differ across the
groups (χ2 p-value > 0.414). However, due to the fact that
differences between males and females have been observed
in terms of aggression and empathy [47], we present ana-
lyses controlling for sex. Since our random assignment to
the three groups did result in significant age differences
between groups, with the passive control group being sig-
nificantly older than the GTA (t(51) = −2.10, p = 0.041)
and
the
Sims
group
(t(50) = −2.38,
p = 0.021),
we
also controlled for age.

Does playing violent video games cause aggression? A longitudinal intervention study
 The participants in the violent video game group played
on average 35 h and the non-violent video game group 32 h
spread out across the 8 weeks interval (with no significant
group difference p = 0.48).
To test whether participants assigned to the violent GTA
game show emotional, cognitive and behavioural changes,
we present the results of repeated-measure ANOVA time x
group interaction analyses separately for GTA vs. Sims and
GTA vs. Controls (Tables 1–3). Moreover, we split
the analyses according to the time domain into effects from
baseline assessment to posttest 1 (Table 2) and effects from
baseline assessment to posttest 2 (Table 3) to capture more
long-lasting or evolving effects. In addition to the statistical
test values, we report partial omega squared (ω2) as an
effect size measure. Next to the classical frequentist statis-
tics, we report the results of a Bayesian statistical approach,
namely BF01, the likelihood with which the data is to occur
under the null hypothesis that there is no significant time ×
group interaction. In Table 2, we report the presence of
significant group differences at baseline in the right most
column.
Since we conducted 208 separate frequentist tests we
expected 10.4 significant effects simply by chance when
setting the alpha value to 0.05. In fact we found only eight
significant time × group interactions (these are marked with
an asterisk in Tables 2 and 3).
When applying a conservative Bonferroni correction,
none of those tests survive the corrected threshold of p <
0.00024. Neither does any test survive the more lenient
FDR correction. The arithmetic mean of the frequentist test
statistics likewise shows that on average no significant
effect was found (bottom rows in Tables 2 and 3).
In line with the findings from a frequentist approach, the
harmonic mean of the Bayesian factor BF01 is consistently
above one but not very far from one. This likewise suggests
that there is very likely no interaction between group × time
and therewith no detrimental effects of the violent video
game GTA in the domains tested. The evidence in favour of
the null hypothesis based on the Bayes factor is not
massive, but clearly above 1. Some of the harmonic
means
are
above
1.6
and
constitute
substantial
evidence [48]. However, the harmonic mean has been cri-
ticised as unstable. Owing to the fact that the sum is
dominated by occasional small terms in the likelihood, one
may underestimate the actual evidence in favour of the null
hypothesis [49].
To test the sensitivity of the present study to detect
relevant effects we computed the effect size that we would
have been able to detect. The information we used consisted
of alpha error probability = 0.05, power = 0.95, our sample
size, number of groups and of measurement occasions and
correlation between the repeated measures at posttest 1 and
posttest 2 (average r = 0.68). According to G*Power [50],
we could detect small effect sizes of f = 0.16 (equals η2 =
0.025 and r = 0.16) in each separate test. When accounting
for
the
conservative
Bonferroni-corrected
p-value
of
0.00024, still a medium effect size of f = 0.23 (equals η2 =
0.05 and r = 0.22) would have been detectable. A meta-
analysis by Anderson [2] reported an average effects size of
r = 0.18 for experimental studies testing for aggressive
behaviour and another by Greitmeyer [5] reported average
effect sizes of r = 0.19, 0.25 and 0.17 for effects of violent
games on aggressive behaviour, cognition and affect, all of
which should have been detectable at least before multiple
test correction.
Discussion
Within the scope of the present study we tested the potential
effects of playing the violent video game GTA V for
2 months against an active control group that played the
non-violent, rather pro-social life simulation game The Sims
3 and a passive control group. Participants were tested
before and after the long-term intervention and at a follow-
up appointment 2 months later. Although we used a com-
prehensive test battery consisting of questionnaires and
computerised
behavioural
tests
assessing
aggression,
impulsivity-related constructs, mood, anxiety, empathy,
interpersonal
competencies
and
executive
control
functions, we did not find relevant negative effects in
response to violent video game playing. In fact, only
three tests of the 208 statistical tests performed showed a
significant
interaction
pattern
that
would
be
in
line
with
this
hypothesis.
Since
at
least
ten
significant
effects would be expected purely by chance, we conclude
that there were no detrimental effects of violent video
gameplay.
This finding stands in contrast to some experimental
studies, in which short-term effects of violent video game
exposure have been investigated and where increases in
aggressive thoughts and affect as well as decreases in
helping behaviour have been observed [1]. However, these
effects of violent video gaming on aggressiveness—if pre-
sent at all (see above)—seem to be rather short-lived,
potentially lasting <15 min [8, 51]. In addition, these short-
term effects of video gaming are far from consistent as
multiple studies fail to demonstrate or replicate them [16,
17]. This may in part be due to problems, that are very
prominent in this field of research, namely that the outcome
measures of aggression and pro-social behaviour, are poorly
standardised, do not easily generalise to real-life behaviour
and may have lead to selective reporting of the results [3].
We tried to address these concerns by including a large set
of outcome measures that were mostly inspired by previous
studies demonstrating effects of short-term violent video
S. Kühn et al.
 gameplay on aggressive behaviour and thoughts, that we
report exhaustively.
Since effects observed only for a few minutes after short
sessions of video gaming are not representative of what
society at large is actually interested in, namely how habi-
tual violent video gameplay affects behaviour on a more
long-term basis, studies employing longer training intervals
are highly relevant. Two previous studies have employed
longer training intervals. In an online study, participants
with a broad age range (14–68 years) have been trained in a
violent video game for 4 weeks [52]. In comparison to a
passive control group no changes were observed, neither in
aggression-related beliefs, nor in aggressive social interac-
tions assessed by means of two questions. In a more recent
study, participants played a previous version of GTA for 12
h spread across 3 weeks [53]. Participants were compared to
a passive control group using the Buss–Perry aggression
questionnaire, a questionnaire assessing impulsive or reac-
tive aggression, attitude towards violence, and empathy.
The authors only report a limited increase in pro-violent
attitude. Unfortunately, this study only assessed posttest
measures, which precludes the assessment of actual changes
caused by the game intervention.
The present study goes beyond these studies by showing
that 2 months of violent video gameplay does neither lead to
any significant negative effects in a broad assessment bat-
tery administered directly after the intervention nor at a
follow-up assessment 2 months after the intervention. The
fact that we assessed multiple domains, not finding an effect
in any of them, makes the present study the most compre-
hensive in the field. Our battery included self-report
instruments on aggression (Buss–Perry aggression ques-
tionnaire, State Hostility scale, Illinois Rape Myth Accep-
tance scale, Moral Disengagement scale, World View
Measure and Rosenzweig Picture Frustration test) as well as
computer-based tests measuring aggressive behaviour such
as the delay frustration task and measuring the availability
of aggressive words using the word completion test and a
lexical decision task. Moreover, we assessed impulse-
related concepts such as sensation seeking, boredom pro-
neness and associated behavioural measures such as the
computerised Balloon analogue risk task, and delay dis-
counting. Four scales assessing empathy and interpersonal
competence scales, including the reading the mind in the
eyes test revealed no effects of violent video gameplay.
Neither did we find any effects on depressivity (Becks
depression inventory) nor anxiety measured as a state as
well as a trait. This is an important point, since several
studies reported higher rates of depressivity and anxiety in
populations of habitual video gamers [54, 55]. Last but not
least, our results revealed also no substantial changes in
executive control tasks performance, neither in the Stop
signal task, the Multi-source interference task or a Task
switching task. Previous studies have shown higher per-
formance of habitual action video gamers in executive tasks
such as task switching [56–58] and another study suggests
that training with action video games improves task
performance that relates to executive functions [59],
however, these associations were not confirmed by a
meta-analysis in the field [60]. The absence of changes in
the stop signal task fits well with previous studies that
likewise revealed no difference between in habitual action
video gamers and controls in terms of action inhibition [61,
62]. Although GTA does not qualify as a classical first-
person shooter as most of the previously tested action video
games, it is classified as an action-adventure game and
shares multiple features with those action video games
previously related to increases in executive function,
including the need for hand–eye coordination and fast
reaction times.
Taken together, the findings of the present study show
that an extensive game intervention over the course of
2 months did not reveal any specific changes in aggression,
empathy, interpersonal competencies, impulsivity-related
constructs, depressivity, anxiety or executive control func-
tions; neither in comparison to an active control group
that played a non-violent video game nor to a passive
control group. We observed no effects when comparing a
baseline
and
a
post-training
assessment,
nor
when
focussing on more long-term effects between baseline and a
follow-up interval 2 months after the participants stopped
training. To our knowledge, the present study employed the
most comprehensive test battery spanning a multitude of
domains in which changes due to violent video games may
have
been
expected.
Therefore
the
present
results
provide strong evidence against the frequently debated
negative effects of playing violent video games. This
debate has mostly been informed by studies showing short-
term effects of violent video games when tests were admi-
nistered immediately after a short playtime of a few min-
utes; effects that may in large be caused by short-lived
priming effects that vanish after minutes. The presented
results
will
therefore
help
to
communicate
a
more
realistic scientific perspective of the real-life effects of
violent video gaming. However, future research is needed to
demonstrate the absence of effects of violent video game-
play in children.
