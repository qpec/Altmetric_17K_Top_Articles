Summary
Background Cholera remains a persistent health problem in sub-Saharan Africa and worldwide. Cholera can be 
controlled through appropriate water and sanitation, or by oral cholera vaccination, which provides transient (~3 years) 
protection, although vaccine supplies remain scarce. We aimed to map cholera burden in sub-Saharan Africa and 
assess how geographical targeting could lead to more efficient interventions.
Methods We combined information on cholera incidence in sub-Saharan Africa (excluding Djibouti and Eritrea) from 
2010 to 2016 from datasets from WHO, Médecins Sans Frontières, ProMED, ReliefWeb, ministries of health, and the 
scientific literature. We divided the study region into 20 km × 20 km grid cells and modelled annual cholera incidence 
in each grid cell assuming a Poisson process adjusted for covariates and spatially correlated random effects. We 
combined these findings with data on population distribution to estimate the number of people living in areas of high 
cholera incidence (>1 case per 1000 people per year). We further estimated the reduction in cholera incidence that 
could be achieved by targeting cholera prevention and control interventions at areas of high cholera incidence.
Findings We included 279 datasets covering 2283 locations in our analyses. In sub-Saharan Africa (excluding 
Djibouti and Eritrea), a mean of 141 918 cholera cases (95% credible interval [CrI] 141 538–146 505) were reported per 
year. 4·0% (95% CrI 1·7–16·8) of districts, home to 87·2 million people (95% CrI 60·3 million to 118·9 million), 
have high cholera incidence. By focusing on the highest incidence districts first, effective targeted interventions 
could eliminate 50% of the region’s cholera by covering 35·3 million people (95% CrI 26·3 million to 62·0 million), 
which is less than 4% of the total population.
Interpretation Although cholera occurs throughout sub-Saharan Africa, its highest incidence is concentrated in a 
small proportion of the continent. Prioritising high-risk areas could substantially increase the efficiency of cholera 
control programmes.

Introduction
Cholera is one of the oldest known infectious diseases. 
Seven times in recorded history, cholera has emerged 
from its presumed natural home near the Bay of Bengal 
and spread globally. Although each of the previous 
six pandemics receded, the present (seventh) pandemic 
has persisted for over 50 years.1 Sub-Saharan Africa is 
one region in which cholera has persisted, with both 
endemic regions (ie, regions with persistent incidence) 
and sporadic, high-mortality epidemics, which can 
amplify already complex crises such as famines and 
civil conflict.2 Between 2000 and 2015, 52 812 (83%) of 
63 658 cholera deaths reported by WHO occurred in 
sub-Saharan Africa,3 although this percentage is probably 
an overestimate because much of south Asia’s cholera 
burden goes unreported.4
Spurred by large outbreaks in Yemen, Tanzania, Haiti, 
and elsewhere in the past decade and the availability of 
new methods to control cholera outbreaks, the WHO-
led Global Task Force on Cholera Control has laid out a 
roadmap for ending cholera as a public health threat by 
2030.5 Access to safe water, appropriate sanitation, and 
hygiene (WaSH) remains the foundation of sustained 
cholera control, but a new generation of easy-to-use oral 
cholera vaccines (OCVs) also have an important role. 
These vaccines are socially acceptable, safe, and effective 
for prevention of cholera for at least 3 years after 
administration.6 OCVs can curb transmission in the short 
term, preventing death and disease while crucial 
improvements to infrastructure are made. However, 
although supplies are increasing every year, the number 
of OCV doses available (~17 million produced in 2017)7 
remains too low for large, generalised campaigns.Even 
if adequate supplies become available, broad use of a 
vaccine with only transient protection is unlikely to be 
cost-effective in populations in which few are at high risk,

and high population turnover in vulnerable populations 
might limit its long-term effect. Thus, integrated 
strategies for efficient use of OCVs and WaSH are needed.
Therefore, to reach the goal of ending cholera as a public 
health threat by 2030, development and implementation 
of methods to identify and appropriately target high-risk 
populations in sub-Saharan Africa and other high-burden 
regions (eg, south Asia) are essential. With this goal in 
mind, we used data on cholera incidence from 2010 to 2016 
over several spatial scales and data on water and sanitation 
coverage to create high-resolution maps of cholera burden 
throughout sub-Saharan Africa.8,9 Using these maps, we 
estimated the number of people living in areas where 
there is a high risk of acquiring symptomatic cholera and 
examined how geographical targeting could lead to more 
efficient interventions. We further characterised variations 
in cholera epidemiology throughout the region that are 
likely to have an effect on cholera control.
Methods
Data sources
We obtained cholera incidence data from sub-Saharan 
Africa from 2010 to 2016 from WHO, Médecins Sans 
Frontières, ProMED, ReliefWeb, ministries of health, 
and published versions of national surveillance data 
when available (already known to the authors and 
through literature searches; appendix). Data were input 
into a standard schema that enabled flexible entry of data 
spanning several reporting periods and case definitions 
(appendix). To estimate annual incidence rates, sub-
annual data for each unique location were aggregated to 
an annual total. Most cholera cases are not confirmed 
clinically; hence, analyses are based on reports of 
suspected 
cholera.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for relevant studies published between 
Sept 25, 2012, and Sept 25, 2017, using the terms “cholera 
burden Africa”. Of 27 results, 24 were either not about cholera 
burden or were about cholera in a particular country or 
context. The remaining three were a study by Ali and 
colleagues, who estimated global burden of cholera in 
endemic countries; a study by Moore and colleagues, who 
explored the effect of El Niño on the distribution of cholera in 
Africa; and a review of cumulative cases of cholera in Africa 
reported to WHO at the country level between 1970 and 2011 
(3·2 million cases), which also includes incidence estimates 
based on data from the study by Ali and colleagues. Ali and 
colleagues applied cholera incidence rates from three sentinel 
sites in India, Indonesia, and Mozambique to at-risk 
populations (classed as those with no access to improved 
sanitation) matched by WHO mortality strata to provide 
country-level estimates of cholera incidence in endemic 
countries. They estimated that 1·3 billion people (550 million 
in sub-Saharan Africa) are at risk for cholera and 2·9 million 
cases (1·7 million in sub-Saharan Africa) occur per year.
Added value of this study
Previous estimates of populations at risk, based on 
national-level data, obscure heterogeneities in cholera 
epidemiology at the subnational level that are likely to have 
important implications for cholera control. In our study we 
used, to our knowledge, the largest combined dataset on 
sub-Saharan African cholera epidemiology to substantially 
increase our understanding of the distribution of the disease 
in the region. We found that 21·7 million people (95% CrI 
19·8 million to 23·7 million) in sub-Saharan Africa live in 
areas of high-cholera incidence (20 km × 20 km grid cells in 
which more than one in 1000 people are reported as infected 
with cholera each year), and 87·2 million (95% CrI 
60·3 million to 118·9 million) live in districts with high 
incidence. An additional 252·4 million (169·0 million to 
351·9 million) people live in districts with moderate incidence 
(≤1 case per 1000 people and >1 case per 10 000 people per 
year) and 177·6 million (112·8 million to 248·7 million) live in 
districts with mild incidence (≤1 case per 10 000 people and 
>1 case per 100 000 people per year). Our results show that 
cholera incidence is concentrated in high-burden hotspots, 
and we project that by targeting districts in order of their 
cholera incidence (from highest to lowest), an effective 
cholera intervention (eg, vaccination campaigns combined 
with improved water and sanitation) could eliminate 50% of 
reported cholera in the region by covering less than 4% of the 
population (~35 million people). Even finer scale targeting of 
interventions could further improve the efficiency of use of 
cholera interventions. 55·9 million (64%) of 86·9 million 
people living in high-incidence districts live in areas where 
cholera incidence follows an endemic pattern.
Implications of all available evidence
Cholera remains a substantial threat to human health in 
sub-Saharan Africa and throughout the world, particularly in 
the poorest and most vulnerable communities. In 
October, 2017, the WHO-led Global Task Force on Cholera 
Control released a roadmap for ending cholera as a public 
health threat by 2030. To accomplish this goal, the tools at 
our disposal need to be used efficiently: improved water, 
sanitation, and hygiene and oral cholera vaccine, particularly 
given resource constraints and insufficient supplies of vaccine 
(~17 million doses in 2017). Detailed mapping of cholera 
incidence can help us to best use the tools at our disposal and 
is an essential component in tracking our progress in the fight 
against cholera. However, substantial challenges to the 
characterisation of global burden remain, including 
expansion of these analyses to south Asia and other 
high-incidence regions and improvement of cholera 
surveillance globally.

Mapping methods
Using a previously published Bayesian modelling 
framework,9 we produced maps of cholera incidence rates 
from 2010 to 2016 by integrating reported cholera case 
data from several spatial and temporal scales with key 
environmental and socioeconomic risk factors (appendix). 
We divided the study region (sub-Saharan Africa, 
excluding Djibouti and Eritrea) into 20 km × 20 km grid 
cells and modelled annual cholera incidence in each grid 
cell using a log-linear regression with covariates and 
spatially correlated random effects. Each observation was 
mapped to the underlying grid cells (using the raster 
package10 in R) and assumed to be an independent 
realisation from a Poisson distribution such that the 
expected number of cases in an observation area was the 
sum of the expected number of cases for all grid cells in 
the observation area. This method means that duplicate 
observations of the same grid cell at the same time (eg, a 
cell included in both a district and province for which 
cholera incidence was reported) are classed as separate 
imperfect observations of the true number of cases in that 
grid cell, rather than non-overlapping case reports (ie, 
cases reported in both datasets are not double counted). 
For point-based observations, such as geo-located case 
data or cases from a single neighbourhood or refugee 
camp, we used the grid cell containing that global 
positioning system point. Grid cells were included in the 
administrative regions where their centroid (ie, centre 
point) fell. We defined province as the first subdivision of 
a country and district as the second subdivision of a 
country after province, state, or region in GADM 2.8.
We included ecological covariates known to affect 
cholera risk: proportion of the population with access to 
improved drinking water (modified WHO/UNICEF Joint 
Monitoring Program definition),8 proportion of the 
population with access to improved sanitation (modified 
WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program definition),8 
population density,11 distance to nearest coastline, and 
distance to nearest major waterbody (ie, lake, river, or 
reservoir). We did not obtain water and sanitation data 
for Djibouti and Eritrea, and these countries were 
excluded from all analyses (appendix). All covariates 
were resampled to 20 km × 20 km grid cells.
We used Markov chain Monte Carlo methods with 
Rstan 2.7 for inference. We ran 2000 iterations of 
the sampler with four parallel chains and assessed 
convergence with the Gelman-Rubin convergence 
statistic    .12 
Estimation of high-risk populations and cases averted 
by simple interventions
We used maps of estimated annual cholera incidence to 
identify grid cells in which annual cholera incidence 
was mild (≤1 case per 10 000 people and >1 case per 
100 000 people), moderate (≤1 case per 1000 people 
and >1 case per 10 000 people), or high (>1 case per 
1000 people; appendix); we did not formally classify 
incidence of less than or equal to one case per 
100 000 people. The number of people living in these 
grid cells was then aggregated by district and country in 
each Markov chain Monte Carlo iteration. Districts were 
categorised as having the highest grid cell incidence 
level (high, moderate, or mild) experienced by at 
least 100 000 residents or 10% of the population of 
that district. We calculated summary statistics (eg, 
medians and means) and 95% credible intervals 
(CrIs) by sampling from the posterior distribution of 
incidence rates.
We estimated the extent of urban areas using 
satellite-derived land cover estimates from MODIS.13 We 
categorised grid cells as urban if more than 1% of the 
cell’s land cover in 2013 was classified as a developed or 
built environment, and as rural otherwise.
When estimating the effect of targeted interventions 
(ie, OCVs or WaSH interventions aimed at the 
population of a specific geographical area), we assumed 
that mean incidence from 2010 to 2016 was reflective of 
expected incidence over the hypothetical intervention 
period. Unless otherwise noted, we assumed that an 
integrated set of interventions would be effective at 
reducing cholera to negligible levels in those targeted. 
When estimating the potential reductions in incidence 
from OCV deployments, we assumed that only people 
aged 1 year and older were eligible (calculated from 
regional birth and death rates14) and that 72% of these 
were protected for 3 years after vaccination, on the basis 
of an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 83% in the first 
year and 69% in the third year.5 We assumed no vaccine 
protection after the third year.6
To characterise differences in cholera epidemiology 
beyond incidence, we plotted overall incidence versus 
year-to-year variation in incidence at the national level 
for all of sub-Saharan Africa, and at the district level for 
two exemplar countries (Nigeria and the Democratic 
Republic of Congo). Calculation of variance requires a 
longer time series than that used in our main analysis, 
hence this analysis was based on national-level 
incidence estimates reported for 2000–15,4 and sub-
national time series for Nigeria (2004–14) and the 
Democratic Republic of Congo (2000–16; these data are 
included in our main analysis when appropriate). Year-
to-year variation is characterised by the coefficient of 
variation (CV; SD of annual incidence divided by the 
mean annual incidence).

Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. JL and ASA had full access to all the data in 
the study and had final responsibility for the decision to 
submit for publication.
Results
In our analyses, we included 279 datasets representing 
epidemiological time series of 1–7 years in length. 
These datasets include data for 2283 different, though 
sometimes nested, locations in 37 countries in 
sub-Saharan Africa (appendix). Our study area (ie, 
excluding Djibouti and Eritrea) had a population of 
988
, 919 755 people. Within our study area, 27·5% 
(272 423 332 of 988 919 755) of the population were classed 
as urban—marginally lower than the 2016 UN and World 
Bank estimate of 38%.14,15 Across sub-Saharan Africa 
(excluding Djibouti and Eritrea), a mean of 141 918 cholera 
cases (95% CrI 141 538–146 505) were reported annually, 
although year-to-year variation was substantial, as indi-
cated by the calculated CVs (data not shown). We 
estimated that 21 695 308 people (19 757 461–23 654 156) in 
sub-Saharan Africa live in 20 km × 20 km grid cells in 
which average annual cholera incidence is greater than 
one in 1000 people (high incidence; figure 1). 61·1% 
(54·2–66·4) of this population live in rural areas, which is 
similar to that in the sub-Saharan African population 
overall (62%).15 65 471 944 people (55 335 356–70 896 060) 
live in grid cells with moderate incidence, and 
126 253 539 people (116 107 402–139 827 994) live in grid 
cells with mild incidence. 543 554 976 people (482 466 484–
588 554 996) live in areas with negligible incidence of 
reported cholera (<1 per 1 million people per year), 
constituting 55·0% of the study area population.
We estimated that 151 of 3751 districts (4·0%, 95% CrI 
1·7–16·8) in our study area, home to 87·2 million people 
(95% CrI 60·3 million to 118·9 million), can be classified 
as having high incidence of cholera (figure 2). 
168·3 million (116·4 million to 229·4 million) OCV doses 
would be needed to vaccinate all eligible individuals 
living in these high-risk districts, which is substantially 
more vaccine than has been produced since the 
establishment of the global stockpile in 2013.7 We 
estimated that vaccinating all eligible individuals living 
in high-risk districts would directly prevent a mean

of 156 536 cases (121 094–194 640) over a 3-year period. 
Extending vaccination to eligible individuals living in 
both moderate-risk and high-risk districts could directly 
prevent an estimated 239 518 cases (173 581–379 223), but 
511·6 million (396·4 million to 635·8 million) doses of 
vaccine would be needed, which is more than 30 times 
the estimated global production in 2017
.7 Indirect effects 
of vaccination campaigns (ie, herd protection) could 
protect more individuals, even with imperfect coverage, 
although there is conflict 
ing evidence as to the nature 
and spatial scale of indirect effects.16,17
Substantial strides could be made towards cholera 
elimination with a fraction of the resources by prioritising 
those areas at highest risk. For example, consider the 
number of people who would need to be effectively 
targeted by an integrated cholera control programme to 
prevent 50% of the cholera cases in sub-Saharan Africa. If 
we focus interventions at the resolution of our maps 
(20 km × 20 km grid cells), targeting the areas in order of 
their number of cases from 2010 to 2016 from highest to 
lowest, incidence could be reduced by 50% by targeting 
areas containing 11·9 million people (95% CrI 5·6 million 
to 21·1 million), which is 1·2% of the study population 
(figure 3). If the same strategy was used to target districts, 
areas containing 35·3 million people (26·3 million to 
62·0 million; figure 3), which consitutue 3·6% (95% CrI 
2·7–6·3) of our study population, would be targeted. An 
alternative strategy ranking by inci 
dence rather than the 
number of cases led to similar reductions (appendix). A 
similar approach could be used to make optimum use of 
existing resources. For example, if 20 million OCV doses 
were used in the highest incidence dis 
tricts, 121 637 (29%) of 
425 754 cholera cases (83 620–182 694) could be prevented 
over 3 years from direct effects of the vaccine.
In practice, targeting the high-incidence areas irre-
spective of geography, population size, accessibility, or 
other factors is probably not feasible because of logistical 
challenges. A more practical strategy might be to prioritise 
countries on the basis of the number of cases that could 
be averted if all high-incidence districts in the country 
were targeted, then launch country-specific programmes 
aimed at those districts. Using this approach, 38·4% of 
cholera cases could be prevented by covering 50·8 million 
people (95% CrI 39·7 million to 62·8 million) in five 
countries: Somalia, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, Sierra Leone, and Ghana (figure 3).

To better characterise the prevailing cholera dynamics 
on this endemic–epidemic spectrum (in which endemic 
dynamics are associated with a low CV and epidemic 
dynamics are associated with a high CV), we plotted the 
CV in year-to-year cholera incidence for each country 
against their mean yearly incidence per 100 000 population 
over that same period (figure 4). This revealed a spectrum 
of cholera dynamics that included both high-incidence 
countries with endemic dynamics (eg, Democratic 
Republic of the Congo) and those with epidemic dynamics 
(eg, Guinea-Bissau). As with incidence, consideration of 
subnational epidemiological patterns that might have 
important policy implications is crucial. For instance, 
although, as a whole, Nigeria had consistently low cholera 
incidence, the eastern part of the country had large 
populations with high rates of epidemic cholera (figure 4). 
Likewise, the high incidence of endemic cholera in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo was driven by districts 
in the east of the country, whereas other areas had a more 
epidemic pattern (figure 4). Unfortunately, for much of 
Africa, we do not have sufficient temporal data of high 
spatial resolution to classify all districts along this 
spectrum. However, assuming high-incidence districts 
within each country follow national dynamics, we 
estimate that 55·9 million people (95% CrI 38·8 million 
to 78·9 million) in Africa live in high-incidence districts 
with endemic (ie, predictable) cholera (CV <1·5), whereas 
31·0 million (95% CrI 20·6 to 39·8 million) live in 
districts with more epidemic dynamics (CV >1·5).
Discussion
By characterising the geographical distribution of 
cholera risk in sub-Saharan Africa, we show that cholera 
is pervasive throughout sub-Saharan Africa, and that 
more than 200 million people are living in areas (ie, 
20 km × 20 km grid cells) with at least some cholera 
incidence. We found substantial heterogeneities within 
and between countries; most cholera incidence is

concentrated disproportionately in a small proportion 
(<5%) of districts. This finding highlights the 
importance of hotspots of high cholera burden in 
driving cholera incidence and a crucial role for spatial 
targeting in cholera control. As global cholera control 
efforts are intensified, with the goal of eliminating 
cholera as a public health threat, this study provides 
important estimates of baseline cholera burden and 
methods for tracking our progress.
The utility of cholera mapping depends on alignment 
of results to the geographical scales at which public health 
policy is made and implemented. The precise scale of 
interest will depend on political boundaries and the 
intervention being considered. Because of the scope of 
our analysis, we focused on broad-scale interventions (eg, 
district level) that might be most relevant to population-
level programmes such as OCV campaigns. By contrast, 
WaSH interventions will often be targeted according to 
the scale of water and sanitation infrastructure (eg, at 
towns or villages), and thus finer scale maps supple-
mented by detailed analysis of the local situation might 
be more informative.
Our analysis shows how the temporal distribution of 
cholera incidence varies substantially from country to 
country, and often also from district to district. Some 
areas have truly endemic cholera with high numbers of 
cases every year (eg, eastern Democratic Republic of the 
Congo). At the other extreme are areas where cholera 
incidence is concentrated in large outbreaks separated by 
many years of low activity. Analysis of variation is likely to 
help to ensure resources are used effectively. The 
distribution of cholera will change, but historic trends are 
usually the best evidence available about future disease 
incidence, and our confidence in future projections will 
be highest when past variation is low. Likewise, the best 
strategy for using OCV and WaSH interventions will 
vary depending on an area’s position on the endemic–
epidemic spectrum. 
Mapping cholera incidence on the basis of reported 
cases has many limitations. Cholera is probably under-
reported, particularly in rural areas. Likewise, many 
countries report incidence of acute watery diarrhoea as a 
proxy for cholera, but even in hyper-endemic areas as few 
as 20% of acute watery diarrhoea cases test positive for 
Vibrio cholerae.18 Although use of several independent 
data sources helped to reduce the risk of bias stemming 
from these issues in reporting of data, correcting for 
these biases remains an area of ongoing research. 
Improvements to cholera surveillance would also help, 
and are a key element of the global cholera control 
roadmap. Year-to-year variation in incidence does not give 
a complete picture of local cholera dynamics, and there 
are many patterns of incidence that are compatible with 
each position on figure 4 (eg, 3 years of high incidence 
followed by 12 years of low incidence could have the same 
variation as peaks in incidence every 5 years); only 
detailed analysis of local data can give a full picture of 
local dynamics. Furthermore, although we identified 
many regions of high cholera incidence where known 
risk factors such as infrastructure problems or displaced 
populations are present, this study was not designed to 
assess the extent to which local cholera incidence can be 
attributed to these factors. Another fundamental 
challenge is local variations in cholera epidemiology. In 
some areas, cholera incidence is likely to increase during 
rainy periods as a result of contamination of water 
supplies. In others, incidence is likely to increase during 
periods of drought, when people are forced to use unsafe 
water sources. Most challenging are outbreaks associated 
with disruptions to the local infrastructure; for instance, 
the increased incidence of cholera after interruption of 
the chlorinated water supply in Uvira, Democratic 
Republic of the Congo.19 Our inability to predict such 
infrastructure problems, combined with local differences 
in cholera epidemiology, is one reason why mapping 
methodologies based mainly on using models fit to 
relationships with environmental covariates have been 
less successful for cholera than for other diseases (eg, 
malaria and dengue). These infrastructure changes and 
local variations in cholera epidemiology might lead to 
substantial deviations from our maps in the distributions 
of cholera risk over time, both in terms of increased and 
decreased incidence. Hence, these maps should be 
updated over time, and are not a substitute for local 
investi 
gations of cholera epidemiology when planning 
local control strategies.
The 87 million people living in districts in sub-Saharan 
Africa with high incidence of cholera will be best helped 
by improvements to local water and sanitation 
infrastructure that would provide broad benefits beyond 
this one disease and ensure sustained cholera elimination. 
However, experience tells us that these improvements 
will need substantial investment and can take years to be 
fully realised, and that success will be dependent on 
unpredictable political or economic conditions. Until that 
time, OCVs remain an important tool to prevent and 
control the spread of cholera. Although OCV supplies 
have increased substantially since establishment of the 
global stockpile7 and are likely to continue to increase, 
they will probably remain insufficient for broad 
untargeted use of the vaccine. The water and sanitation 
improvements that are the ultimate solution to global 
cholera are likely to be most effective if they are 
geographically targeted. Regardless of how reductions in 
incidence are achieved, targeting people at high risk can 
have effects across much larger populations. As with 
sub-Saharan Africa, targeted approaches are likely to be 
an essential component of cholera control programmes 
in other high-burden regions, such as south Asia, Haiti, 
and the Middle East. Hence, fine-scale incidence mapping 
exercises such as this have an important role to play 
globally in maximising the benefits of scant resources, 
forecasting demand for vaccines and other supplies, and 
tracking progress in the fight against cholera.
