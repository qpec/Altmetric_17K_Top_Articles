Abstract
Objective—To identify whether there is a decline in sexual functioning related to the menopause 
transition or to hysterectomy.
Methods—In a cohort of 1,390 women aged 42–52, with intact uterus and at least one ovary, not 
using hormone therapy, and pre- or early perimenopausal at baseline, we fit piecewise linear 
growth curves to 5,798 repeated measurements (7 visits spanning 14.5 years) of a sexual 
functioning score (range, 5–25) as a function of time relative to date of final menstrual period 
(FMP) or hysterectomy.
Results—Mean sexual functioning at baseline in women with a dateable FMP was 18.0 (standard 
deviation, 3.4). There was no change in sexual function until 20 months before the FMP. From 20 
months before until one year after the FMP, sexual function decreased by 0.35 annually (95% CI:
−0.44, −0.26) and continued to decline more than one year after the FMP, but at a slower rate 
(−0.13 annually, 95% CI:−0.17, −0.10). The decline was smaller in African-Americans and larger 
in Japanese compared to whites. Vaginal dryness, lubricant use, depressive symptoms, or anxiety

 did not explain decline in sexual function. Women who had a hysterectomy prior to the FMP did 
not show decline in sexual function prior to hysterectomy, but scores declined afterwards (0.21 
annually, 95% CI:−0.28, −0.14).
Conclusions—Decline in sexual function became apparent 20 months prior to FMP and slowed 
one year after FMP through 5 years afterwards. A decline in sexual function was observed 
immediately after hysterectomy and persisted for the 5 years of observation.

Sexual functioning is an important component of women’s lives and has increasingly 
received public health, pharmaceutical, and medical attention.1 Over 75% of the middle-
aged women in the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN) reported that sex 
was moderately to extremely important.2 Sexual functioning, however, declines with 
age,1,3–9 leading to much debate about the contribution of menopause to sexual activity and 
functioning.
The menopause transition is a gradual change from pre- to postmenopause; menopause is 
defined retrospectively after 12 months of amenorrhea has elapsed. Some evidence suggests 
that sexual functioning declines over the menopausal transition, yet whether this decline is 
due to menopause, aging, or other factors such as the availability of a partner,10–14 
psychological function,1,10,11,15–18 and/or health10,12,14,15,19 remains inconclusive. Previous 
analyses have assessed sexual function changes in relation to menstrually-defined 
menopause transition categories, which classify stages of the menopause according to 
menstrual irregularity or number of months of amenorrhea. The present analyses seek to 
determine if sexual function declines at or around the final menstrual period (FMP), a more 
precise measure of the timing of menopause compared to menopause transition stages.
Research on menopause and sexual function typically focuses on women who have had a 
natural menopause and excludes women with hysterectomy.3,10,11,14,15,20–23 However, there 
is an entirely separate literature on the impact of hysterectomy on sexual functioning. 
Prospective studies often report that sexual functioning improves for most women following 
hysterectomy for benign indications.24,25,26 However, these studies typically compare pre-
surgery sexual function, assessed within a few weeks prior to surgery, to subsequent 
symptom relief and may not consider the impact of a bilateral oophorectomy in conjunction 
with a hysterectomy, factors that may overstate benefits of hysterectomy. Research has not 
been conducted in longitudinal cohorts of women with extensive measurement of sexual 
function and relevant covariates well before and post-surgery to determine whether 
hysterectomy has an impact on sexual function separate from that of aging. Nor has research 
compared sexual functioning between naturally postmenopausal women and those who have 
had a hysterectomy. The present analyses use prospective data on sexual functioning to 
examine if and when the rate of change in sexual functioning occurs in relation to a 
hysterectomy performed prior to the FMP.

 The primary objectives of this study, conducted in a multi-ethnic/racial cohort, are to: (1) 
identify whether there is a decline in sexual functioning around the time of the FMP for 
naturally menopausal women, and around the date of surgery for women who have 
undergone hysterectomy (with or without bilateral oophorectomy) before their FMP; (2) 
determine if the rate of decline in sexual functioning is related to age at FMP or 
hysterectomy (with or without bilateral oophorectomy), race/ethnicity, changes in health 
status, hormone therapy use, and partner status; and (3) evaluate whether a decline in sexual 
functioning around the FMP or hysterectomy (with or without bilateral oophorectomy), date 
can be explained by other changes that occur with menopause (vaginal dryness, vasomotor 
symptoms, depression, anxiety, or lubricant use).
METHODS
SWAN is a multi-racial/ethnic observational cohort study of the menopausal transition in 
3,302 community-dwelling women at 7 sites across the United States.27 Details of 
enrollment, which began in 1996, have been previously reported.27 Baseline eligibility 
criteria included the following: age 42–52 years, intact uterus and at least one ovary, not 
currently using exogenous hormones affecting ovarian function, at least one menstrual 
period in the previous 3 months, and self-identification with a site’s designated racial/ethnic 
groups. Half of each site’s sample consisted of white women and the other half from one 
minority population (African-Americans, Japanese, Chinese, or Hispanic).
Standardized assessments were completed approximately annually in a clinic setting where 
trained interviewers administered physiological and self-report measures. Study forms were 
available in English, Cantonese, Japanese and Spanish with appropriate bilingual staff 
administering them. Each site received Institutional Review Board approval and all 
participants gave written informed consent.
Sexual Functioning Measure
Sexual outcome variables were measured annually at each study visit from baseline to visit 
06 and biannually thereafter (at visits 08, 10, and 12) using a 20-item self-administered 
questionnaire designed to address sexual activity and function over the past 6 months in 
women with and without partners that was returned to staff in a sealed envelope. The 
questionnaire was derived from several sources,1,10,28,29 designed to cover sexual 
functioning domains of interest, and has been previously described.15,30 For the present 
analyses, we developed a single sexual functioning score based on the Female Sexual 
Functioning Index (FSFI).31 The score was developed using a separate dataset from the 
STRIDE study32 that contained both the FSFI and items from the SWAN questionnaire and 
matched five of the FSSI domains with those items from SWAN (sexual desire, emotional 
satisfaction, ability to climax, arousal, and pain). The resulting scale in STRIDE was highly 
correlated with the total FSFI score (rho=0.84). At SWAN visit 12, we administered the 
Short Form of the Personal Experiences Questionnaire (SPEQ)33 in addition to the SWAN 
questionnaire. Correlation between the SPEQ total score and our sexual functioning measure 
was 0.70, providing further validity of our measure. In the SWAN data, all responses were 
recorded on five-point Likert scales. We reverse-coded the item related to pain and then

 summed the five variables for a range of scores from 5–25 with higher numbers indicating 
better functioning (coefficient alpha =.70). The score was created only at the visits that the 
women reported being sexually active.
Primary Exposure Variables
The primary exposure was time (in months) before or after a woman’s FMP for women who 
had a natural menopause transition, and time (in months) before or after the date of surgery 
for women who had a hysterectomy (with or without bilateral oophorectomy), before natural 
menopause. FMP date was determined by annual, standardized interview and defined as the 
last menstrual bleeding date reported during the visit immediately before the first visit when 
the participant was classified as postmenopausal (12 months of amenorrhea). We excluded 
women who reported use of exogenous hormones one year before the FMP. For women who 
had a hysterectomy, we obtained the date of surgery from medical records, if available, or by 
participant self-report. Others have shown that self-reporting of hysterectomy status is 
relatively accurate.34 We included women who underwent a hysterectomy alone or with a 
unilateral or bilateral oophorectomy prior to a defined FMP. In SWAN, only a small number 
of women (n=16) had both ovaries removed without hysterectomy and they were excluded 
from these analyses.
Other Predictors
We examined the following variables, which have previously been related to sexual 
functioning,3,10,11,14,15,20–23 as covariates of sexual functioning trajectory: age at FMP or 
hysterectomy (in years), self-reported race/ethnicity (white, African-American, Chinese, 
Japanese, or Hispanic), partner status (married or partnered versus not married or partnered; 
time-varying, assessed at each visit), hormone therapy use, and overall health (time-varying, 
assessed at each visit). Overall health was self-assessed annually using a 5-level scale that 
was collapsed into 2 levels (excellent/very good/good vs. fair/poor).
To address our third objective, to examine mechanisms that might explain any change in 
sexual functioning around the time of the FMP, we examined the following time-varying 
factors that often co-occur with menopause: vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes and night 
sweats), vaginal dryness, lubricant use during intercourse, depression, and anxiety. The 
frequency of experiencing each symptom (hot flashes, night sweats, or vaginal dryness) in 
the past two weeks was reported at each study visit on a 5-level scale, collapsed into 3 levels 
for analysis (not at all, 1–5 days, and 6–14 days). Women who were sexually active were 
asked how often they had used lubricants in the past 6 months as part of the sexual function 
questionnaire. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale was administered 
annually to assess depressive symptoms.35 Anxiety, assessed annually, was the summed 
score of number of days in the past 2 weeks in which four symptoms (irritability or 
grouchiness, feeling tense or nervous, heart racing or pounding, fearful for no reason) were 
experienced.36 The total anxiety score was dichotomized with scores greater than or equal to 
four indicating high anxiety symptoms.36

 Study Sample
Of the 3,302 women recruited into the SWAN cohort at baseline, 1,396 had known FMP 
date by visit 12 (they did not report use of exogenous hormones before or at the first visit 
classified as postmenopausal and thus the date of the FMP was not obscured by exogenous 
HT), and 305 women reported having undergone (1) hysterectomy only (n=65), (2) 
hysterectomy and unilateral oophorectomy (n=20), or (3) hysterectomy and bilateral 
oophorectomy (n=220). Women who reported bilateral oophorectomy without hysterectomy 
were excluded (n=16). At each visit, only women who completed the sexual function 
questionnaire and reported engaging in sexual activity with a partner (regardless of partner’s 
sex) were assigned a sexual function score. To be included in the analysis, a woman had to 
report sexual activity at one or more study visits. A total of 232 women in the natural 
menopause group and 79 women in the hysterectomy group were missing the sexual 
function score at all visits, leaving 1,164 women in the natural menopause group and 226 
women in the hysterectomy group eligible to be included in the analysis of sexual 
functioning. Sexual functioning data were obtained from these women between one and 
seven times over the SWAN study; the majority of women (63%) provided data at four or 
more visits. There were a combined 4,932 measurements from the 1,164 women in the 
natural menopause group, and 866 measurements from the 226 women in the hysterectomy 
group.
Statistical Analysis
Separate but equivalent analyses were conducted in the women who went through a natural 
menopause and the women who had a hysterectomy before a natural menopause. In the 
former group, we estimated the trajectory of change in sexual function score over the 
menopause transition; in the latter group, we estimated the trajectory of sexual functioning 
before and after hysterectomy. To estimate these trajectories and to examine associations 
with factors that might affect the trajectory, we used a three-step process: (1) nonparametric 
locally-weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) regression on time from FMP or date of 
hysterectomy to determine the functional form of the mean trajectory,37 (2) fitting a 
piecewise linear growth curve with different sets of inflection (or knots, where the slope 
changes) to determine optimal knot placement, and (3) mixed effects regression that fit a 
piecewise linear growth curve with fixed knots to estimate slopes in each segment and the 
associations of postulated factors with slopes.
In step 1, we used nonparametric LOESS regression to fit a smooth curve to the repeated 
measures of sexual function score as a function of time from FMP or hysterectomy date. Our 
observations spanned from 13 years before to 15 years after the FMP. For this step only, we 
excluded observations more than 5 years before or after FMP (or date of hysterectomy) to 
avoid overfitting sparse data at the extremes. The LOESS plots revealed that the mean 
trajectory of sexual function score was piecewise linear in both groups of women, but with 
two inflections in the natural menopause women and only one inflection point in the 
hysterectomy women (Figure 1).
In steps 2 and 3, we used mixed effects regression to fit piecewise linear models to the 
repeated measurements of sexual function score as function of time before or after the FMP

 or hysterectomy date, using linear splines with fixed knots. We included all available 
observations in steps 2 and 3, as mixed effects models are robust against the undue influence 
of outliers as well as to missing at random data, thus allowing the maximal use of all 
available data to estimate the large number of model parameters. Based on the results of the 
LOESS regression from step 1, we used a linear spline with two fixed knots and 3 time 
periods in the natural menopause group; time period 1 was the period from 13 years before 
to 20 months before the FMP, time period 2 was 20 months before to 1 year after the FMP, 
and time period 3 was from 1 year after to 15 years after the FMP. In the hysterectomy 
group, we use a 2-segment linear spline with one fixed knot, with time period 1 defined as 
the period from 13 years before to the date of the hysterectomy and time period 2 defined as 
from the date of hysterectomy to 15 years after. To account for within-woman correlation 
between repeated observations, we included person-specific random effects for the intercept 
and the slopes in each segment. Since the inflection points could not be precisely localized 
from the LOESS plots of step 1, in step 2, we tested appropriateness of knot locations by 
running null models with only random (woman-specific) effects for intercept and slopes, and 
no fixed effects, varying the locations of knots, and examining the residuals unexplained by 
the model. The residual within-woman variance in the natural menopause group was 
smallest when the two knots were placed at 20 months prior to the FMP date and 1 year after 
the FMP. In the hysterectomy group, it was smallest when the single knot was placed at the 
hysterectomy date.
In step 3, with the knots fixed at the optimal locations determined in step 2, we first added 
age at FMP (continuous), race/ethnicity, marital/partnership status (yes vs. no), and self-
reported health (excellent/good vs. fair/poor) to the model, as fixed effects on the intercept/
level and each of the time slopes, to assess how each of these covariates influenced the level 
and/or rate of change in each time period of the sexual function trajectory. We also adjusted 
for site and HT use subsequent to FMP or hysterectomy. In the model for the hysterectomy 
group, two additional covariates were included: bilateral oophorectomy status and 
menopause transition status prior to the hysterectomy. For time-varying covariates (such as 
marital status, health, and HT use), the value of the covariate at the current time was allowed 
to affect current level of sexual functioning, and the value of the covariate at the beginning 
of a segment (i.e. at study baseline for the first time period of the growth curve and at each 
of the knots for subsequent time periods) was allowed to affect the slope of that period. The 
estimated regression coefficients for a covariate’s effect on the slopes in the different 
segments of the sexual function trajectory were combined to obtain the total effect on 
cumulative change in sexual function over a 7-year period (from 2 years prior, to 5 years 
after) bracketing the FMP or hysterectomy date.
RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
At baseline, participants were 42–52 years of age with a mean age of 46. Approximately 
45% were white. Baseline characteristics of the study participants, stratified by those who 
had a dateable FMP and those who had a hysterectomy (with or without bilateral 
oophorectomy), prior to their FMP, are presented in Table 1. Over the 14.5 years of follow-

 up, 16% (N=226) of the study sample underwent a hysterectomy before menopause. Of 
those, 157 (69.5%) had bilateral oophorectomies. Participants who had hysterectomy were 
younger (p=0.004), less likely to be Asian (p=0.004), more likely to report excellent or very 
good health (p=0.01), and more likely to have anxiety (p=0.001) compared to those with a 
datable FMP. The mean age at which women had a hysterectomy was lower than the mean 
age at which the FMP occurred in the remainder of the sample (p<.0001).
Mean sexual function score at the baseline visit was 18.0 and standard deviation (SD) 3.4 in 
the natural menopause group, and 18.5 and 3.3 respectively, in the hysterectomy group 
(Table 1). By visit 12, mean sexual function score had fallen to 16.5 (SD 4.4) in the natural 
menopause women and 16.9 (SD 3.7) in the hysterectomy group. Change over time in other 
time-varying characteristics of the sample are shown in Supplemental tables 1–4.
Sexual Functioning Trajectories
Figure 2 shows the unadjusted, model-predicted mean trajectory of sexual function scores as 
a function of time before and after the FMP in the sample with an observed FMP and in the 
sample that underwent a hysterectomy. Sexual function declined over time for both groups. 
Women with an observed FMP had a mean sexual function score at FMP date of 17.6 
(SD=2.58). There was no significant change (M=−0.04 per year, SD=0.40, p=0.19) in sexual 
function score up to 20 months before the FMP (period 1). In the period of time 20 months 
before to one year after the FMP (period 2), sexual function score decreased by 0.35 per year 
(SD=0.39, 95% CI for mean:−0.44, −0.26, p<.0001). In the final time period, (period 3), 
sexual function continued to decline, but at a slower rate than that observed in the period 2 
(M=−0.13 per year, SD=0.43, 95% CI for mean:−0.17, −0.10, p<.0001) (Figure 2, Table 2). 
Formal comparisons of the difference in slopes between these three time periods showed that 
the average rate of change in sexual function was significantly different between time 
periods 1 and 2 (p<.0001) and between time periods 2 and 3 (p<.0001). The mean 
cumulative change in sexual function score from two years before to five years after the 
natural FMP was −1.48 (95% CI=−1.70, −1.25, p<.0001). These results suggest that among 
women who experience a natural menopause, sexual function starts to decline at about 20 
months before the FMP and that this decline slows, but does not cease, at about a year after 
FMP.
The age at which a woman reached her FMP did not appear to be associated with either her 
sexual function at the time of the FMP or the cumulative 7-year change in sexual function 
(Table 3). African-American women experienced a smaller decline in sexual function and 
Japanese women a larger decline, compared to white women (the referent group). Chinese 
women (compared to white women) and women with fair/poor health (compared to women 
in good/excellent health) reported a lower level of sexual functioning at the time of their 
FMP but their total 7-year change was similar (Table 3).
When potential mechanisms for the effect of natural menopause on sexual function were 
added to the model as predictors of both level (intercept) and slopes (Table 4) the sexual 
functioning trajectory (including level, slopes, and cumulative 7-year change) was not 
significantly affected; there remained a significant decrease in sexual function in time 
periods 2 and 3 in the referent group women. Relative to the referent group, defined as

 women without vaginal dryness, lubricant use, depression or anxiety, sexual function score 
at the FMP was 0.56 lower for those with vaginal dryness 1–5 days a week (95% CI=−0.74, 
−0.38, p<.0001) and 0.99 lower for those with vaginal dryness 6–7 days per week (95% CI=
−1.25, −0.73, p<.0001), 0.31 higher for those who used lubricants (95% CI=0.11, 0.51, 
p=0.002), 0.30 lower for those with significant depressive symptoms (95% CI=−0.53, −0.07, 
p=0.02), and 0.30 lower for those with significant anxiety symptoms (95% CI=−0.52, −0.07, 
p=0.004). Despite their association with overall sexual functioning score, vasomotor 
symptoms, vaginal dryness, lubricant use and anxiety were not significantly associated with 
rate of change in sexual function for any of the time periods, suggesting that these variables 
did not explain the effect of FMP on change in sexual function.
Women who had hysterectomy (with or without bilateral oophorectomy), had a mean sexual 
function score at the date of hysterectomy of 18.0 (SD=2.60). There was no statistically 
significant decline (M=−0.10 per year, SD=0.19, p=0.07) in sexual function before 
hysterectomy (Figure 2, Table 5). However, following hysterectomy there was a significant 
decline in mean sexual function score of 0.21 per year (SD=0.16, 95% CI for mean=−0.28, 
−0.14, p<.0001). The mean accumulated change in sexual function score from two years 
before to five years after hysterectomy was −1.25 (95% CI=−1.64, −0.86, p<.0001).
Retention of both ovaries, age at the time of hysterectomy, race/ethnicity, health, marital 
status, HT use, and menopause transition stage prior to hysterectomy had no significant 
effect on trajectory of sexual functioning (Table 6). The referent category consisted of 
women with bilateral oophorectomy (because they were 70% of the surgical sample); the 
rate of decline in sexual function among those whose ovaries were retained did not appear to 
differ from those who underwent bilateral oophorectomy, but small sample size limits 
confidence in this lack of difference (Table 6). A significant decrease in sexual function 
score after hysterectomy (mean −0.25 per year in the referent group, 95% CI: −0.49, −0.003, 
p=0.04) also remained after the addition of potential explanatory factors to the adjusted 
model (Table 7). Relative to the referent group, sexual function score at hysterectomy was 
0.92 lower for those with 1–5 days of vaginal dryness per week (95% CI=−1.40, −0.43, 
p=0.003) and 1.63 lower for those with vaginal dryness 6–7 days per week (95% CI=−2.28, 
−0.98, p<.0001). Experiencing vaginal dryness 6–7 days per week was also associated with 
a smaller decline in sexual function after hysterectomy. Vasomotor symptoms, anxiety, and 
depression were not significantly associated with rate of change in sexual function for either 
time segment.
DISCUSSION
This large, community-based study of middle-aged women who were sexually active during 
the menopausal transition examined longitudinal reports of sexual functioning over 14.5 
years in two groups of women: those who experienced a natural transition and whose FMP 
date was known and those who underwent a hysterectomy (70% with bilateral 
oophorectomy) prior to their FMP. In the former group, we witnessed a decline in sexual 
functioning that began approximately 20 months prior to the FMP and slowed somewhat, but 
did not cease, at the one-year post FMP mark. Further, adjustment for possible confounders 
and/or mechanisms by which the menopause transition might influence sexual function

 (poorer health, vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness, depression, anxiety, or partner status) 
did not materially alter the estimated influence of the menopause transition on sexuality. 
Among women with a hysterectomy, onset of a decline in sexual function began 
immediately after surgery and the rate of decline persisted, unchanged, in the post-surgical 
period. This decline was not substantially altered by the addition of potential confounders 
and/or mechanisms and did not appear to be mitigated by ovarian retention.
Our results in the natural menopause sample agree with those from the only other published 
study of sexual functioning in relation to FMP,14 which also found that sexual desire began 
to decline prior to the FMP and that the decline was steeper in the period of time bracketing 
the FMP than it was further distant from the FMP. The previous study used both a different 
analytic approach and different assessment scale (a one-item question on sexual desire) than 
we did, but the similarities are striking: the steepest drop in sexual desire was from 3 years 
prior to FMP to 2 years after the FMP. Our study has the added advantages of including a 
longer post-FMP follow-up and a more diverse sample. We found important racial/ethnic 
differences in the decline in sexual function; African-American women experienced a 
smaller decline and Japanese women experienced a larger decline, compared to white 
women. For example a married Japanese women would have a decline of 3.35 (1.76 + 1.59, 
see table 4) which is comparable to one standard deviation of the sexual functioning score at 
baseline, and quite large. On the other hand, a married African-American women would 
have a decline of only 0.81 (1.59 – 0.78).
Our study supports a sizeable negative effect of menopause on sexual functioning in many 
women. The decline in sexual functioning scores average a half of a standard deviation over 
the 7 years bracketing the menopause transition; half a standard deviation is generally 
considered a meaningful change. To better interpret the change in total score, we looked at 
the mean change in each of the 5 items. Consistent with our previous work,15 the items that 
showed the most change in both the natural menopause and hysterectomy groups were 
increased pain and decreased desire; frequency of arousal and climaxing during sexual 
activity decreased less, and emotional satisfaction did not change at all in either group. In 
the case of pain, this might indicate a change from almost never to sometimes or almost 
always. Frequency of desire might change from “about once per week’ to “once or twice per 
month.”
To address whether the change in sexual function in relation to the FMP could be explained 
by factors that often co-occur with the FMP, we adjusted for VMS, vaginal dryness, the use 
of sexual lubricants, depression and anxiety--factors associated with both menopause and 
sexual function.15,38 Although all of these factors, except for VMS, were related to sexual 
function score at FMP, accounting for them did not impact sexual function score decline 
across the time segments, providing support that these factors did not explain the impact of 
menopause on sexual function decline.
Our study and that of Woods and colleagues,14 not only point to the influence of the 
menopause transition on sexuality, but underscore the manifestation of this a few years prior 
to the FMP and observed most strongly in the transmenopausal period (the few years 
bracketing the FMP).39 Further, the present analysis adds to the growing body of literature

 that attests to the influence of the transmenopause on biology and health; estradiol levels, 
bone density, bone turnover markers, integrated hip strength, and cardiovascular risk factors 
each show a remarkably similar pattern of onset of change prior to, with most notable 
changes bracketing, the FMP.39–43
Our results focusing on the decline in sexual functioning relative to FMP date are consistent 
with, but provide greater detail than, other research that has evaluated sexual functioning 
across menopausal stages. The time frame of 20 months prior to and through 1 year after 
FMP corresponds roughly to early and late perimenopause and 12 or more months following 
FMP would correspond to early postmenopause. Cross-sectional studies have shown greater 
pain30,44,45 and lower interest or desire among peri- or postmenopausal women10,20–22,44 
compared to premenopausal women and longitudinal studies have shown that sexual 
dysfunction increases over the menopause transition.3,10,11,15,46 Previous longitudinal 
SWAN analyses reported a decrease in desire and increase in pain beginning in late 
perimenopause15 and the Melbourne study found a peak in sexual problems late in the 
transition.3 The longitudinal Penn Ovarian Aging11 reported that sexual dysfunction 
increased from pre to early perimenopause to postmenopause and that the transition from pre 
to late in the transition was particularly dramatic. None of these studies, however, has 
followed women as far into the postmenopausal years as SWAN. Our results suggest a 
continued, albeit slower, decline in sexual function after 20 months following the FMP.
Women who underwent hysterectomy (70% of whom also had bilateral oophorectomy) prior 
to their FMP reported a decline in sexual functioning following their hysterectomy, even 
after adjustment for covariates. Previous research has shown that although hysterectomy is 
generally associated with improved sexual function, concomitant oophorectomy with the 
resultant loss of estrogen may compromise sexual function.26,47–49 Although we did not find 
that ovarian retention lessened the post-operative drop in sexual function, this could be due 
to the small percentage of women who did not get a bilateral oophorectomy. In addition, due 
to the SWAN eligibility requirements of women being pre or early perimenopausal and with 
intact uterus at study entry, our study does not include women who had a hysterectomy at a 
younger age when the effect of loss of ovarian function may be even greater. Importantly, 
our study was able to compare change in sexual function among women who had their 
surgery prior to FMP with those who experienced a natural menopause transition. Although 
sexual function declined following surgery, sexual function scores were not different from 
those of women who experienced natural menopause. In fact, the scores over time are 
remarkably similar.
Limitations of these data should be mentioned. First, the sexual functioning questionnaire 
used was not one of the more newly developed, validated questionnaires such as the Short 
Personal Experiences Questionnaire (SPEQ)33 or Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI).31 
However, the score was developed based on items that mapped to the FSFI and was further 
validated against the SPEQ. Second, some participants missed visits or were lost to follow-
up and others did not answer the sexual functioning questionnaire at visits when they were 
not sexually active, resulting in missing data. However, the majority of the women (84%) 
with missing sexual functioning data were only missing data in interim visits; i.e. they 
provided sexual functioning data both before and after visits with missing data. Since the

 analytic methods used are relatively robust to missing data, and the multivariable models 
incorporated numerous factors strongly associated with the likelihood of data being missing, 
our findings are likely to not be affected by these missing data. It should be noted that 119 
women in the sample (9.9%) stopped providing sexual functioning data although they 
continued to participate in SWAN. If some of these women stopped being sexually active for 
reasons related to the menopausal transition, our findings could represent underestimates of 
the average rates of decline in sexual functioning over the menopause transition. Third, the 
analysis does not account for changes in circulating sex steroid levels, psychosocial factors 
beyond depressive and anxiety symptoms, or partner factors (such as poor health or erectile 
dysfunction) that may help to explain our findings. Although endogenous estradiol and 
testosterone were related to sexual desire in the Seattle Midlife Women’s Health Study,14 
only testosterone was related to sexual functioning in SWAN.50,51 Additionally, the 
hysterectomy group was predominantly women who also had bilateral oophorectomy and 
the mean decline rates in this group may have been driven by oophorectomy. The number of 
women who had hysterectomies with ovarian retention was too small (n=85) to identify a 
robust trajectory of sexual functioning in this group. Indication for hysterectomy was not 
collected in SWAN and could be a potentially important factor.
The present study has several strengths. The study includes a large community-based sample 
followed for a longer period of time than other studies, thus showing sexual functioning over 
a 10-year period before and after natural menopause or hysterectomy. The study uses a novel 
modeling approach that allows for a more precise understanding of the relation between 
onset and rates of change of sexual functioning surrounding the menopause transition. In 
addition, our multiethnic/racial sample allows for a better understanding of the impact of the 
menopause transition on different groups of women.
CONCLUSIONS
It is important for women and their health care providers to understand factors that may 
impact women’s experience of sexual function in relation to both the natural menopausal 
transition and to hysterectomy with or without ovarian conservation. Our study supports a 
meaningful decline in sexual functioning in relation to the menopause transition, most 
strongly apparent in the few years bracketing the final menstrual period. Women who 
underwent a hysterectomy (most with bilateral oophorectomy) prior to their final menstrual 
period, also had a decline in their sexual functioning. Although symptoms that accompany 
menopause--vaginal dryness, depressive symptoms, and anxiety-- were each independent 
predictors of greater sexual function decline, these symptoms did not explain the effect of 
menopause or surgery on sexual function. This study also underscores that sexual function 
decline varies in women with differing backgrounds: for example, in our sample, compared 
to the reference group of white married women undergoing natural menopause, married 
Japanese women’s drop in sexual functioning was twice as large.

FMP, slopes in the 3 time segments, and cumulative 7-year change) in non-referent women, add means in referent women to the corresponding effect sizes for each of the predictors that differ between 
referent woman and non-referent woman. For example, 7-year change in a Japanese woman who is otherwise similar to the referent women is computed as follows: −1.86–1.52=−3.38.
