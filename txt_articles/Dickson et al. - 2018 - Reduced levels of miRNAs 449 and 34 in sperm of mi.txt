Abstract
Exposure of male mice to early life stress alters the levels of specific sperm miRNAs that promote stress-associated
behaviors in their offspring. To begin to evaluate whether similar phenomena occur in men, we searched for sperm
miRNA changes that occur in both mice and men exposed to early life stressors that have long-lasting effects. For
men, we used the Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) questionnaire. It reveals the degree of abusive and/or
dysfunctional family experiences when young, which increases risks of developing future psychological and physical
disorders. For male mice, we used adolescent chronic social instability (CSI) stress, which not only enhances sociability
defects for >1 year, but also anxiety and defective sociability in female offspring for multiple generations through the
male lineage. Here we found a statistically significant inverse correlation between levels of multiple miRNAs of the
miR-449/34 family and ACE scores of Caucasian males. Remarkably, we found members of the same sperm miRNA
family are also reduced in mice exposed to CSI stress. Thus, future studies should be designed to directly test whether
reduced levels of these miRNAs could be used as unbiased indicators of current and/or early life exposure to severe
stress. Moreover, after mating stressed male mice, these sperm miRNA reductions persist in both early embryos
through at least the morula stage and in sperm of males derived from them, suggesting these miRNA changes
contribute to transmission of stress phenotypes across generations. Since offspring of men exposed to early life trauma
have elevated risks for psychological disorders, these findings raise the possibility that a portion of this risk may be
derived from epigenetic regulation of these sperm miRNAs.
Introduction
Many studies have confirmed that exposure to severe
stress during childhood has long-lasting negative health
effects. One of the most convincing has been the Adverse
Childhood Experience (ACE) Study, which is supported
by over 100 publications1. It was initiated by collaboration
between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
and
Kaiser
Permanente’s
Department
of
Preventive
Medicine. It led to the ACE Study Questionnaire (see
http://www.acestudy.org/index.html), where anonymous
yes or no answers to 10 questions involving participant’s
experiences at home until the age of 18 are quantified.
Five are personal questions about physical abuse, verbal
abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect, and emotional
neglect. Five relate to other family members: an alcoholic
parent, a victim of domestic violence, incarceration,
diagnosed with a mental illness, and the disappearance of
a parent through divorce, death, or abandonment. A score
≥4 puts one at serious risk for future mental and physical
health problems, such as a 4.6-fold increased rate of
depression2 and a ~30-fold increased rate of suicidal

population reports scores of ≥4.
There is a growing appreciation that clinicians should
be aware of patients’ traumatic experiences, particularly
when young, because they add to their risk for physical
and psychiatric maladies4,5. Moreover, sensitivity to PTSD
has been shown to correlate with ACE score6–8 implying
it can be used as a screening tool to identify people who
should take extra precaution to avoid trauma. However,
some may not answer the ACE questionnaire accurately
due to suppressed memories or because of the sensitive
nature of many of the questions, particularly in settings
that do not allow anonymity. Thus, discovery of unbiased
markers for early trauma could complement ACE surveys
in some clinical settings.
Moreover, offspring of those exposed to early life
trauma are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders9. This
phenomena has also been demonstrated in rodents10,11.
For example, transmission of the effects of stress across
generations has been observed after exposing male mice
to a wide variety of psychological stresses, including social
defeat12, chronic physical restraint13, multiple variable
perturbations in adults14, social instability beginning in
adolescence15, and early maternal separation16. While
some evidence in mice points to environmentally induced
changes in sperm DNA methylation as a mechanism for
transmission of stress phenotypes16, the best evidence to
date supports small RNA species in sperm. Recent studies
show that sperm contain various types of cytoplasmic
RNAs (e.g., mRNAs, miRNAs, siRNAs, lnc-RNAs, piwi-
interacting RNAs, and fragments of tRNAs) that have the
potential to contribute to embryo development17–19. Two
sets of reports on psychological stresses in mice implicate
miRNAs. In one20, early maternal separation of males
leads to increased expression of a variety of sperm miR-
NAs in adult males and depression and social defects in
their future offspring. Injection of total sperm RNA from
stressed fathers into zygotes mimics some of these effects
when these animals matured. In the other21, chronic
variable stress in mice leads to increases in the expression
of nine sperm miRNAs, and when these miRNAs are
injected into fertilized zygotes, phenotypes similar to
those in offspring from stressed fathers are also observed.
Here, we find that severe early life stress is associated
with a reduction in sperm of both mice and men of the
levels of multiple members of 34/449 miRNA family that
all have the same seed sequence and function together to
influence brain development and spermatogenesis22,23.
miR-34 expression has also been implicated in stress
regulation in the adult brain24–26. In mice, the effect of
stress on these sperm miRNAs crosses generations, as
reductions in miR-449a and miR-34c are found in both
early embryos derived from stressed fathers and in sperm
of males derived from these embryos.
Materials and methods
Animals and care facilities
All mice included in this study are of the CD-1 strain,
obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Males used for
CSI stress began the protocol at 28 days postnatal age, and
control females used for breeding were 8 weeks of age. All
animals are housed in temperature, humidity, and light-
controlled (14 h on/10 h off LD cycle) rooms in a fully
staffed dedicated animal core facility led by on-call
veterinarians at all hours. Food and water were provided
ad libitum. All procedures and protocols involving these
mice were conducted in accordance with and approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA. Sample
sizes for the mouse work were based upon our previous
experience with these experiments in the lab to yield
adequate concentration of RNA for downstream work,
and no animals were excluded from use in this study. No
randomization procedures were needed to separate mice
into groups.
Volunteer recruitment and ACE administration
All research performed on humans and human samples
were approved by the University of Louisville School of
Medicine Human Subjects Protection Program (IRB
#15.1004). We included only Caucasians to limit con-
founding by race given possible variation in sperm
miRNA and response to the ACE questionnaire, and
because Caucasians represented the vast majority of
patients in the selected source population. Informed
consent to participate in this observational study was
obtained from all subjects. Eligible men were adminis-
tered the adverse child experiences (ACE) survey in a self-
reporting format after attaining proper consent. Men then
provided a semen sample for their initial workup (n =
28 samples total). Mature motile sperm were isolated
using a Percoll gradient to effectively separate mature
sperm from immune cells, dead tissue, immature sperm,
and other contaminants27. An aliquot of purified sperm
was saved for expression analysis, the remainder being
used for semen analysis and downstream IVF/ICSI pro-
cedures. Demographic and health information for all
samples was provided by the clinical team in a de-iden-
tified, password-protected spreadsheet to the research
team, with a password known only to the authors of this
study. All men providing samples for this study were
compensated with a $50 gift card. This study was funded
to recruit eligible participants for a 1-year period. Given
typical clinic volumes and anticipated research partici-
pation rates, we expected to recruit a sample of 35 sub-
jects over 12 months. A sample size of 35 subjects
achieves 80% power to detect a correlation coefficient of
0.45 for the association between miRNA levels and ACE
score using a two-sided hypothesis test with a significance

 level of 0.05. Recruitment was halted at 28 subjects due to
the challenge of lower than expected clinic volume.
Microarray analysis
Microarray analysis of ten human sperm samples was
performed by LC Sciences Inc. (Austin, TX), using 1 μg of
total RNA as starting material. Each sample was run on its
own custom µParaflo microfluidic chip developed by LC
Sciences. Each chip investigates expression of every
experimentally verified human miRNA currently listed in
miRbase v21. After hybridization, fluorescence images
were collected, analyzed, and quantified by LC Sciences to
generate a differential miRNA expression analysis, using
the appropriate statistical analysis and correcting for
multiple comparisons, between our low ACE group
(scores 0–1, n = 5) and high ACE group (scores >4,
n = 5).
RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from both mouse and human
sperm samples using the miRVana miRNA Isolation Kit
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Total RNA was extracted from mouse embryos using the
Norgen Single-Cell RNA Isolation kit (Norgen Biotek
Corp.) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Con-
centration of RNA was determined using an Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer (Agilent Genomics) and NanoDrop-1000
(Thermofisher Scientific). Relative gene expression for
all samples was determined using the Taqman Advanced
cDNA synthesis and qPCR system (Applied Biosystems)
purchased from Thermofisher Scientific. An aliquot of
10 ng of total RNA from sperm and 1 ng of total RNA
from embryos was used in the initial cDNA synthesis step.
Real-time PCR was performed for each target and sample
in triplicate on a StepOnePlus PCR System (Applied
Biosystems). All data were analyzed using the Compara-
tive ΔΔCT method to generate relative expression data
using miR-192-5p as the internal control for all samples.
Chronic social instability (CSI) stress
Male “F0” juvenile CD-1 mice arrived at P21 and were
given a week to acclimate to our mouse facilities. Starting
at P28, the composition of each mouse cage (four mice
per cage) was randomly shuffled twice per week, for
7 weeks, such that each mouse was housed with three new
mice in a fresh, clean cage at each change. This shuffling
was randomized to reduce the chance that any mouse
would encounter the same mouse twice. Control mice
were housed four mice per cage with the same cage mates
for the duration of the protocol. After 7 weeks, mice were
housed in pairs with a cage mate from the final cage
change and left for 2 weeks to remove acute effects of the
final change. Male mice (both control and stressed) were
then “tease” mated with a naive female mouse for 2 days
to increase sperm production. Mice were then either
killed for sperm collection or mated with control female
mice overnight to generate “F1” animals, with successful
mating confirmed via presence of copulation plug the
following morning. We have previously shown that
stressed males can be mated multiple times and still
transmit stress phenotypes to their offspring, so male
mice were used for mating, embryo collection, or sperm
collection as needed.
Mouse sperm collection
Mature, motile mouse sperm was isolated via the swim-
up method. Briefly, male mice were anesthetized under
isoflurane and killed via rapid decapitation. The caudal
epididymis and vas deferens were dissected bilaterally and
placed in 1 mL of warm (37 °C) M16 medium (Sigma-
Aldrich) in a small Petri dish. Under a dissection micro-
scope, sperm were manually expressed from the vas
deferens using fine forceps, and the epididymis was cut
several times before incubating at 37 °C for 15 min to
allow mature sperm to swim out, then large pieces of
tissue were removed. The remainder of the extraction
took place in a 37 °C warm room. The sperm-containing
media was centrifuged at 3000 RPM for 8 min, super-
natant was withdrawn and discarded, and 400 µL of fresh,
warm M16 medium was then carefully placed on top of
the pellet. The tubes were then allowed to rest at a 45°
angle for 45 min to allow the motile sperm to swim-up
out of the pellet into the fresh medium. The supernatant
containing the mature sperm was then carefully with-
drawn and combined (n = 4–6 mice per group pool) in
order to reach sufficient quantities of RNA, and cen-
trifuged again for 8 min at 3000 RPM to pellet the motile
sperm. Supernatant was withdrawn and discarded, and
the pellet was frozen on dry ice for later processing.
Mouse embryo collection
To obtain sufficient numbers of embryos, a super-
ovulation protocol was employed. Control adult (8 weeks)
female mice were injected with 7.5 U of pregnant mare
serum gonadotropin (PMS, National Hormone & Pitui-
tary Program, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center) and 46 h
later injected with 7.5 U of human chorionic gonado-
tropin (HCG, Sigma-Aldrich) and placed into the home
cage of the male to mate overnight. In the morning,
female mice were checked for copulation plugs and
returned to their own cages. If 2-cell and 4-cell embryos
were desired, female mice were sacrificed about 1.5 days
later, and for 8-cell/morula they were sacrificed about
2 days later. On the day of collection, mice were sacrificed
via cervical dislocation. Under a dissection microscope,
the uterus was removed and a very high-gauge needle was
inserted into the opening of the fallopian tubes and the
embryos were flushed out using warm 37 °C EmbryoMax

 FHM HEPES-buffered medium (1×) w/o Phenol Red
(EMD Millipore). The embryos were separated according
to cell number, and any unfertilized ova or embryos dis-
playing
unusual
morphology
were
discarded.
The
embryos of interest were pooled by cell stage, and snap
frozen on dry ice. Each specific cell-stage sample repre-
sents embryos derived from the mating of at least three
distinct breeding pairs of mice. Typically, three–four
super-ovulated females were mated with three–four males
(either F0 control, or F0 stress) for each experiment in
order to generate enough embryos needed for a single
pool (30–60 embryos total) of a specific cell-stage embryo
(2-cell, 4-cell, etc.) to recover sufficient quantities of RNA
for downstream analysis. As the females are sacrificed
during the collection process, this entire protocol was
repeated with new females for every embryo stage col-
lection to generate one pool each of one specific stage
embryo for both F0 control fathers and F0 stressed
fathers.
Statistical analysis
Demographic, behavioral, and sperm characteristics
were summarized for the study population, stratified by
ACE score (low (0–1), medium (2–4), high (≥5)), using
the appropriate summary statistic for normally and non-
normally distributed data. For all presented data, center
values and estimates of variation are stated in the figure
legends. For qPCR analysis, miRNA was compared
between low (0–1) and high (>4) ACE groups using the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test (groups are independent and
equivariant). Spearman’s correlation coefficients were
used to characterize the strength and direction of the
linear relationship between continuous variables. Uni-
variate linear regression analysis was performed to esti-
mate slope coefficients, accompanying p values, and 95%
confidence intervals. For all analyses described in this
section, p values are two-sided and alpha was set to 0.05.
All statistical analyses were performed in Graphpad Prism
v7.0 unless otherwise stated. The nature of this study did
not allow for blinding as only objective measurements are
reported for these samples.
Results
Inverse association between expression of members of
sperm miRNA families 449 and 34 with ACE score of
Caucasian males
To test whether the extent of childhood trauma influ-
ences sperm miRNA content in adulthood, 28 Caucasian
volunteers, drawn from men giving sperm samples to the
University of Louisville Fertility Clinic, filled out the
Adverse
Childhood
Experience
(ACE)
study
ques-
tionnaire. The participants were 32.4 years of age on
average, with a mean BMI of 26.7 kg/m2. Among them,
~20% reported scores ≥4, which is higher than the
national average (~12%), but close to the average in
Kentucky
(~16%)
(https://www.childtrends.org/wp-
content/uploads/2014/07/Brief-adverse-childhood-
experiences_FINAL.pdf). The demographic, behavioral,
and sperm characteristics of study participants are sum-
marized in Table 1, stratified by ACE score (low, medium,
and high). There were not clinically significant differences
noted across the groups defined by ACE score for most
parameters.
Lower

counts
were
observed in the high ACE group, although a morphology
score of 4% is still considered normal according to the
most recent World Health Organization guidelines for
semen analysis parameters28. The other two parameters,
sperm count and motility, were also well within normal
limits according to these guidelines for all groups (count
≥15 mil/mL; motility ≥40%).
As a first-level screen to find candidate miRNAs whose
expression in sperm correlates with ACE score, we ran-
domly chose sperm samples from five men with the
highest ACE scores (≥4) and five with the lowest (0–1)
and performed miRNA array analysis on each sample.
Among hundreds of miRNAs detected, multiple members
of the miRNA family miR-34/449, which all code for the
same mRNA inhibitory seed sequence, had the most
significant differences in expression between the ACE
groups. One set includes two of the three paralogs of miR-
449, miR-449a, and miR-449b, and the other set, two of
the three paralogs of miR-34, miR-34b, and miR-34c.

 miR-449c and miR-34a were not detected at reliably
quantifiable levels in the arrays. qPCR analysis of these
miRNAs revealed an approximately four–fivefold reduc-
tion in their levels in sperm samples from the high vs. low
ACE score groups (Fig. 1a). To date, no other miRNA
tested from this screen has been found to be statistically
significantly different between the ACE groups. As
examples, we show results for miR-152 and miR-375-3p
(Fig. 1a). The former was chosen because array data
suggested it might be different, and the latter was chosen
because it was identified by two groups as a miRNA ele-
vated in sperm of male mice exposed to two different
types of stress20,21.
We next performed qPCR analysis on these targets in all
of the remaining samples. Because the relative levels of
miR-449a and miR-449b, as well as miR-34b and miR-34c,
were similar to each other in almost every sample (Fig. 1b,
c) miR-449a and miR-34c were used as representatives of
each family. We found a statistically significant inverse
correlation between ACE score and levels of both miR-
NAs (miR-449a r = −0.4357, P = 0.0205; miR-34c-5p r =
−0.397, P = 0.0376), where many of the highest ACE
score samples had miR-449a and miR-34c levels as much
as ~300-fold lower than many of the low ACE score
samples (Fig. 2a, b). In contrast, no significant correlations
were observed for the association between miR-152 and
miR-375-3p and ACE score (Fig. 2d, e). The levels of the
miR-449a and miR-34c are coordinately expressed in each
sample (r = 0.913, P = 0.001), implying that stress reg-
ulates their levels in sperm by the same mechanism (Fig.
2c).
Sperm miRNA content has been shown to be influenced
by smoking29,30 and obesity31,32; however, in univariate
regression analysis neither BMI nor smoking status were
significantly associated with expression of sperm miR-
449a or miR-34c (Extended Data, Table 1). Moreover,
previous studies found that neither smoking nor obesity
influence the levels of sperm miR-449a/b or miR-34b/
c30,32. miRNA expression was also not associated with
behavioral characteristics, such as alcohol and drug use,
sperm count, or sperm motility. However, a significant
association was observed between sperm morphology
score and levels of miR-449a, but not miR-34c. Overall,
these data imply that early life stress in men, as measured
by ACE score, is associated with reduced levels of miR-
449a and miR-34c.
Levels of miR-449a and miR-34c are decreased in sperm of
male mice exposed to chronic social instability stress, early
embryos derived from them, and sperm from adult mice
derived from these embryos
To determine whether early life stress also regulates
sperm miR-449 and miR-34 in mice, we exposed adoles-
cent males to chronic social instability (CSI) stress33,
which induces sociability defects in male mice for at least
1 year after stress ceases. It involves changing the cage
composition of mice twice a week for 7 weeks beginning
during adolescence. We chose this protocol because like
adverse childhood experiences, it involves chronic stress
when animals are young (adolescents) that leads to long-
term negative effects on behavior, it is performed in
outbred CD-1 mice that like humans, but unlike inbred
mouse strains, are genetically diverse, and because we
have replicated its findings15. Both miR-449a and miR-34c
are sharply reduced in sperm of these stressed males when
they are adults (~fivefold) (Fig. 3a). In contrast, and
consistent with human results described above, no sig-
nificant difference was found for sperm miR-152 and
miR-375-3p, even though the latter was previously shown
to increase after exposure of male mice to two different
stress paradigms20,21.

 Recently, we15 and then others13 showed that CSI stress
has transgenerational effects through the male lineage
that induces anxiety and sociability defects specifically in
F1 female offspring of stressed males. Moreover, even
though the F1 males showed no anxiety or sociability
defects, we showed that they induce both behavioral
defects specifically in their F2 female offspring15. A dis-
tinguishing feature of miR-449a/b and miR-34b/c is that
they are among a small set (14) of miRNAs in mice that
are not present in oocytes but delivered to them from
sperm upon fertilization34, suggesting that changes in
these miRNAs observed in sperm of stressed males may
influence subsequent generations via alterations in early
development. Thus, 2 weeks after cessation of CSI stress
exposure, stressed male mice and control counterparts
were mated and early embryos were collected. Consistent
with this hypothesis, we discovered large decreases in the
expression of both miR-449a and miR-34c in embryos
isolated at the 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, and morula stages
(~two–tenfold) from the mating of stressed males to
control females, compared to those from the mating of
control males (Fig. 3b, c).
When male embryos from stressed fathers reached
adulthood, levels of their sperm miR-449a and miR-34c
were assayed, and found to also be severely suppressed
(~tenfold) compared to those from control males (Fig.
3d), consistent with our previous finding that these mice
transmit stress phenotypes to their F2 offspring15.
Discussion
In this study of Caucasian men, an inverse association
was found between a measure of exposure to abusive and/
or dysfunctional family behavior and sperm levels of
multiple members of the miR-449/34 family. Prior studies
in humans have documented environmental effects on
sperm RNAs. However this study is the first to show that
stress affects the levels of human sperm miRNAs, and
those found reduced are different from miRNAs pre-
viously detected in response to smoking30 or obesity32. In
addition, the ACE questionnaire used in this study is
designed to capture stressful events occurring ~20 years
earlier during one’s childhood. Moreover, although a high
ACE score (>4) implies a very substantial health risk, only
a minority of men (~20–30%) in this category present
with significant psychological and physical problems as
adults1. Despite this, almost all of the men with high ACE
scores in our study displayed reduced levels of these
miRNAs. If this pattern holds in a larger independent
Fig. 2 ACE score negatively correlates with expression of miR-449a and miR-34c in 28 human sperm samples. a–b qPCR analysis of miR-449a,

 cohort of men, it would indicate that high levels of mal-
treatment and household dysfunction in childhood are
associated with altered sperm miRNA profiles in adult-
hood regardless of whether men are susceptible or resis-
tant to the psychological burdens associated with high
ACE scores.
This is not to imply that current psychiatric state or
recent traumatic experiences do not also suppress these
sperm miRNAs. In fact, experiments reported here in
mice detected severely reduced levels of sperm miRNAs
449a and 34c only 2 weeks after the cessation of social
instability stress. Thus, the low levels of sperm miRNAs
449a and 34c observed in some men in this study with low
ACE scores could be a consequence of their present
psychiatric state or exposure to recent severe stressful
experiences. They could also be due to early life traumas
that are not surveyed in the ACE questionnaire, such as
being bullied. In addition, low-sperm miRNA expression
in men reporting low ACE scores could be due to the fact
that some people under-report their adverse childhood
experiences35. This could be because the survey asks
sensitive questions such as exposure to sexual abuse that
many are uncomfortable admitting occurs, or because
some have suppressed these memories. These possibilities
support a larger follow-up study, now in the planning
stage, that surveys men’s present psychiatric state along
with their ACE scores and sperm miRNA levels. This may
reveal that low levels of sperm miRNAs 449a and 34c are
associated with men’s present psychiatric problems, in
addition to their early exposure to abuse, which could
have translational significance.
Interestingly, both sharply reduced levels of sperm miR-
449 and miR-34 family members and severe stress have
been found to be associated with reduced sperm quality
and fertility in men32,36. Consistent with these observa-
tions, we found low-sperm morphology score associated
with low miR-449a expression. Additionally, sperm count
and sperm motility showed a trend toward associating
with expression of both miRNAs, although these were not
significant. Thus, we hypothesize that the connection

 found previously between stress and sperm quality and
fertility may be through, at least in part, stress effects on
the levels of sperm miRNAs 449a/b and 34b/c.
This study is the first to identify novel sperm miRNA
changes associated with exposure to childhood trauma in
men. The relatively small sample size limits our ability to
more deeply explore the association between ACE scores
and miRNA expression, including additional mediating
variables. Nevertheless, these findings will serve to inform
a subsequent larger study that can support control for
additional confounding factors in a multivariable envir-
onment. In addition, this was a cross-sectional design with
only a single measurement of miRNA and assessment of
exposure to childhood trauma. Longitudinal studies with
information on behavioral and psychological factors
through adulthood, with repeated measurements of sperm
miRNA content, could illuminate how cumulative expo-
sures affect miRNA levels, potential mediating factors and
the durability of these effects and the association between
these sperm miRNAs levels and fertility in men.
The discovery that low levels of multiple members of the
miR-34/449 gene family are associated with men’s high
ACE scores also has potential implications for the next
generation. A growing body of evidence, including pheno-
types of knockout mice that cannot process miRNAs34,
supports the idea that paternal miRNAs are delivered to the
zygote after fertilization and contribute to early embryo
development. Also, other stress paradigms in male mice
have been shown to increase expression of specific sperm
miRNAs (not miRs 449 and 34), and injection of them into
zygotes fertilized by normal males induces a stress pheno-
type in offspring that is consistent with that obtained by
mating stressed fathers20,21. Interestingly, among identified
sperm miRNAs, only miR-449a/b and miR-34b/c have been
shown to be expressed specifically in sperm, not eggs, and
are present in zygotes, supporting a mechanism for how the
small amounts of these miRNAs in sperm can impact early
development. Moreover, in humans, sperm miR-34b/c
levels correlate with day-3 embryo quality, implantation
rate, and pregnancy after intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection
(ICSI) procedures used in fertility treatment, implying this
sperm derived miRNA influences early development in
humans37. Finally, the present study is unique among stu-
dies implicating sperm miRNAs in the transgenerational
effects of stress by demonstrating that the same stress-
induced miRNA expression level changes that occur in
sperm of stressed male mice, persist in F1 embryos derived
from them, and in sperm of F1 male mice derived from
these embryos, which we showed previously15 pass on
stress-associated traits to their F2 offspring.
If a similar phenomenon occurs in humans, we predict
that reductions in the levels of sperm miR-449a and miR-
34c we detect in men with high ACE scores could be
transmitted to their sons. If so, this process could yield
another explanation for why some men in our survey
display low miR-449a and miR-34c levels despite report-
ing low ACE scores. They may have inherited these sperm
changes from their fathers because of their exposures to
abusive and/or dysfunctional family life, a possibility we
are planning to test in a follow-up study determining
whether fathers of these men have higher than average
ACE scores.
miR-449 and miR-34 have the same inhibitory seed
sequence and function together in mouse development,
such that knockout of either miR-449 or miR-34 paralogs
alone does not yield a detectable developmental pheno-
types, whereas knockout of both sets of miRNAs mice
show defects in brain development and spermatogenesis
caused, at least in part, by defective microtubule and
associated cilia function22. The fact that we detect
reduction in expression of paralogs of both miR-34 and
miR-449 genes in sperm of men with high ACE scores, as
well as in sperm of mice exposed to sociability stress and
in embryos derived from them, adds to the potential
functional significance of these findings.
The gene targets of these miRNAs that carry out the
described developmental functions in both mice and
humans have not been clarified, but documented targets
in other cell types where these miRNAs are also expressed
include p53, CDK6, c-MYC, HDAC1, and BCL-2, all of
which could have long-lasting effects on embryo devel-
opment38. Thus, the severe decrease in expression of both
miR-449a and miR-34c we detect in early embryos from
stressed male mice could alter brain development and the
process of spermatogenesis in subtler ways than knockout
mice. These developmental changes may contribute to the
enhanced anxiety and defective sociability we observed in
female offspring, and altered sperm miRNAs we detect in
male offspring of male mice exposed to chronic social
instability stress15, a question now being addressed.
Interestingly, miR-34 paralogs have also been implicated
in regulating the stress response in adult mice, although
the findings are somewhat contradictory24–26. However,
our evidence to date suggests those effects may be distinct
from the transgenerational effect we have observed. First,
the effects observed in adults have been detected in male
mice, whereas we detect stress-related phenotypes only in
adult female offspring of stressed males. Second, complete
knockout of all miR-34 paralogs has no effect on basal
anxiety, only changes induced by acute stress22. In con-
trast, we detect basal changes in anxiety and sociability in
female offspring of stressed males. Third, our phenotype
is likely the consequence of suppressing both 34 and 449
members of the miRNA family. Finally, we have observed
severe decreases in miR-34c levels in early embryos
derived from stressed males. However, to date we have
not been able to detect significant changes in its levels in
brain regions of adult females derived from these

 embryos, where these studies have documented the con-
sequences of altering all three paralogs of miR-34.
It is known that children of parents who report high
ACE scores are at higher risk for stress-associated beha-
vioral problems, which has been assumed to be due to
parental behaviors39,40. This study raises the possibility
that another component is stress-induced miRNA chan-
ges in men’s sperm. Thus, just as genetic testing of sperm
DNA can assess risk across generations, future studies
based on these findings may reveal value in epigenetic
testing of sperm miRNA as well.
