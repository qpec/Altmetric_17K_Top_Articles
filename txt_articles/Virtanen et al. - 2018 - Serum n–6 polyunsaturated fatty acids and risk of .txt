 ABSTRACT 
1 
Background: The cardioprotective properties of linoleic acid (LA), the major n-6 
2 
polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), have been recognized, but less is known about its 
3 
associations with other causes of death. Relatively little is also known about how the minor n-
4 
6 PUFA, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) and 
5 
arachidonic acid (AA) relate to mortality risk.  
6 
Objective: We investigated the associations of the serum n-6 PUFA, an objective biomarker 
7 
of exposure, with risk of death in middle-aged and older men and whether disease history 
8 
modifies the associations. 
9 
Design: We included 2480 men from the prospective Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk 
10 
Factor Study, aged 42-60 years at baseline in 1984-1989. The stratified analyses by the 
11 
baseline disease status included 1019 men with history of CVD, cancer or diabetes and 1461 
12 
men without disease history.  
13 
Results: During the mean 22.4-y follow-up, 1143 disease deaths occurred. Of these, 575 were 
14 
CVD deaths, 317 cancer deaths and 251 other deaths. Higher serum LA concentration was 
15 
associated with lower risk of death from any cause [multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 
16 
in the highest vs. lowest quintile=0.57 (95% CI: 0.46,0.71;P-trend<0.001)] and with deaths 
17 
due CVD (extreme-quintile HR=0.54 (95% CI: 0.40,0.74;P-trend<0.001), and non-CVD/non-
18 
cancer causes (HR=0.48, 95% CI: 0.30,0.76;P-trend=0.001). Serum AA had similar, although 
19 
weaker, inverse associations. Serum GLA and DGLA were not associated with risk of death, 
20 
and none of the fatty acids were associated with cancer mortality. The results were generally 
21 
similar among those with or without history of major chronic disease (P-interactions>0.13). 
22 
Conclusions: Our findings showed an inverse association of higher biomarker of LA intake 
23 
with total and CVD mortality and little concern for risk, thus supporting the current dietary 
24 
recommendations to increase LA intake for CVD prevention. The novel finding of the inverse 
25 
association of serum AA with risk of death needs replication in other populations.

INTRODUCTION 
30 
Dietary guidelines recommend partial replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-3 and n-6 
31 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This 
32 
is largely based on the established beneficial effect of this replacement on serum LDL 
33 
cholesterol concentrations (1). Effects on CVD have also been investigated in dietary fat 
34 
modification trials, where saturated fat sources, mainly butter, were replaced by 
35 
predominantly n-6 PUFA linoleic acid (LA)-containing vegetable oils and margarines. 
36 
However, many of these trials did not find a statistically significant effect on CVD incidence, 
37 
and meta-analyses from these trials have come to divergent conclusions (2-6). The majority of 
38 
the prior studies were secondary prevention trials, so the effect of dietary fat modification for 
39 
primary prevention also remains unclear. The mixed evidence has led to on-going debate 
40 
regarding the scientific validity of existing dietary advice to replace saturated fat with n-6 
41 
PUFA-rich vegetable oils, and highlight the need for additional research to address this 
42 
question of major clinical and public health importance.  
43 
Apart from CVD, concerns have also been raised regarding the influence of n-6 PUFA on 
44 
the risk of several other diseases and overall mortality (7). A primary hypothesized 
45 
mechanism that may lead to harm suggests that because LA and its endogenous metabolites 
46 
(Supplemental Figure 1), particularly arachidonic acid (AA), are substrates for several pro-
47 
inflammatory mediators, increased LA intake may promote chronic low-level inflammation 
48 
associated with several chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegeneration (8-
49 
10). Also, because the metabolism of the n-3 and n-6 PUFA share the same metabolic 
50 
pathways, the n-6 PUFA could compete for the same enzymes with the n-3 PUFA, thereby 
51 
theoretically negating the anti-inflammatory and other beneficial effects of n-3 PUFA. Yet, 
52 
most of the observational evidence to date have focused on the association of n-6 PUFA with 
53 
cardiovascular outcomes, with relatively few studies assessing the relation of n-6 PUFA with 
54 
non-CVD endpoints and total mortality. 
55 
Because of the limited and mixed evidence, our purpose was to assess the prospective 
56 
associations of the serum n-6 PUFA with risk of any disease death and of cause-specific 
57 
mortality in middle-aged and older men from eastern Finland. Using circulating n-6 PUFA as 
58 
exposure, we were able to assess LA and AA, but also two other, mainly endogenously 
59 
produced n-6 PUFAs, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid 
60 
(DGLA). In addition, to allow inferences on the potential of n-6 PUFA for primary and 
61 
secondary prevention, we also separately investigated the associations of the n-6 PUFA 
62 
among those free of major chronic disease at baseline (CVD, cancer, type 2 diabetes) and 
63 
among those with history of disease. 
64 
 
65 
SUBJECTS & METHODS 
66 
Study population 
67 
The Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study (KIHD) was designed to 
68 
investigate risk factors for CVD, atherosclerosis, and related outcomes in a prospective, 
69 
population-based sample of men from eastern Finland (11). Therefore, the non-CVD 
70 
outcomes used in the current study can be regarded as secondary endpoints and those results 
71 
considered as exploratory. The baseline examinations were carried out in 1984-1989. A total 
72 
of 2682 men (83% of those eligible) who were 42, 48, 54 or 60 years old at baseline were 
73 
recruited in two cohorts (Supplemental Figure 2). The first cohort consisted of 1166 men 
74 
who were 54 years old, enrolled in 1984-1986, and the second cohort included 1516 men who 
75 
were 42, 48, 54 or 60 years old, enrolled in 1986-1989. The baseline examinations were 
76 
followed by the 4-year examination round (1991-1993) in which 1038 men from the second 
77 
cohort (88% of the eligible) participated. At the 11-year examination round (1998-2001), all 
78 
men from the second cohort were invited and 854 men (95% of the eligible) participated. The 
79 
 4 
 
baseline characteristics of the entire study population have been described (12). The KIHD 
80 
protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Kuopio. All 
81 
subjects gave written informed consent for participation. Subjects with missing baseline data 
82 
on serum fatty acids (n=161) were excluded, leaving 2480 men for the main analyses. The 
83 
stratified analyses by the baseline disease status included 1019 men with a history of CVD 
84 
(n=926), cancer (n=48) or type 2 diabetes (n=148) and 1431 men without history of disease. 
85 
 
86 
Measurements 
87 
Fasting venous blood samples were collected between 8AM and 10AM at the baseline 
88 
examinations. Subjects were instructed to abstain from ingesting alcohol for three days and 
89 
from smoking and eating for 12 hours prior to giving the sample. Detailed descriptions of the 
90 
determination of serum lipids and lipoproteins (13), assessment of medical history and 
91 
medications at baseline (13), family history of diseases (13), smoking (13), alcohol intake 
92 
(13), blood pressure (13), and physical activity (14), have been published. Serum C-reactive 
93 
protein was measured with an immunometric assay (Immulite High Sensitivity CRP Assay, 
94 
DPC, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Body mass index (BMI) was computed as the ratio of weight 
95 
in kilograms to the square of height in meters. Education was assessed in years by using self-
96 
administered questionnaire. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg 
97 
or treatment for hypertension. Diabetes was defined as self-reported diabetes mellitus or 
98 
fasting blood glucose of 6.7 mmol/L or more. Dietary intakes were assessed with 4-d food 
99 
recording (15). 
100 
 
101 
Serum fatty acids 
102 
Serum esterified and non-esterified fatty acids were measured in 1991 from samples that 
103 
had been stored at -80°C in one gas chromatographic run, as described previously (16). Serum 
104 
fatty acids were extracted with chloroform-methanol. Chloroform phase was evaporated and 
105 
treated with sodium methoxide, which methylated esterified fatty acids. Quantification was 
106 
carried out with reference standards purchased from NU-Check Prep Inc. (MA, USA). Each 
107 
analyte had individual reference standard, and an internal standard was eicosane. Fatty acids 
108 
were chromatographed in an NB-351 capillary column (HNU-Nordion, Helsinki, Finland) by 
109 
a Hewlett-Packard 5890 Series II gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard Company, Avondale, 
110 
PA, since 1999 Agilent Technologies Inc.) with a flame ionization detector. Results are 
111 
presented as a proportion of total serum fatty acids. The interassay coefficient of variation 
112 
(CV%) for repeated measurements was 8.7% for LA (18:2n-6), 11.6% for GLA (18:3n-6), 
113 
8.3% for DGLA (20:3n-6), and 9.9% for AA (20:4n-6). 
114 
 
115 
Ascertainment of follow-up events 
116 
Deaths were ascertained by a computer linkage to the national cause of death register using 
117 
the Finnish personal identification code (social security number). There were no losses to 
118 
follow-up. All deaths were coded according to the Tenth International Classification of 
119 
Disease (ICD) codes. All disease deaths that occurred from the study entry to December 31, 
120 
2014, were included. ICD codes I00-I99 and C00-D48 were used to define CVD and cancer 
121 
deaths, respectively. Deaths due accidents or suicides (ICD codes S00-T98) were not 
122 
included.  
123 
 
124 
Statistical analysis 
125 
The univariate relationships of the serum n-6 PUFA with baseline characteristics were 
126 
assessed by means and linear regression (for continuous variables) or χ2-tests (for categorical 
127 
variables). Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for relevant covariates were 
128 
used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of incident events. The validity of the proportional 
129 
 5 
 
hazards assumption was evaluated by using Schoenfeld residuals, and the assumptions were 
130 
met. Absolute risk reduction (ARR) was calculated by multiplying the absolute risk (AR) in 
131 
the reference group by the multivariable-adjusted HR reduction in the comparison group. The 
132 
confounders were selected based on established risk factors for mortality, previously 
133 
published associations in the KIHD, or on associations with exposures or outcomes in the 
134 
present analysis. The Model 1 included age (years) and examination year. The multivariable 
135 
model 2 included Model 1 and body mass index (kg/m2), smoking (pack-years), education 
136 
(years), income (euro), leisure-time physical activity (kcal/week), intake of alcohol (g/week), 
137 
serum long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (%), hypertension (yes/no), family history of 
138 
CVD, cancer or diabetes (yes/no), use of hypercholesterolemia, hypertension or diabetes 
139 
medications at baseline or during follow-up (yes/no), and intakes of saturated fatty acids 
140 
(percent of energy), monounsaturated fatty acids (percent of energy), trans fatty acids (percent 
141 
of energy), fiber (g/day), and fruits, berries and vegetables (g/day). We also further adjusted 
142 
the model 2 for potential effect mediators: serum LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and 
143 
C-reactive protein. All quantitative variables were entered in the models as continuous 
144 
variables. Cohort mean was used to replace missing values in covariates (<3%). Statistical 
145 
significance of the interactions on a multiplicative scale was assessed by stratified analysis 
146 
and likelihood ratio tests using a cross-product term. Tests of linear trend were conducted by 
147 
assigning the median values for each category of exposure variable and treating those as a 
148 
single continuous variable. Potential nonlinear associations were assessed semiparametrically 
149 
using restricted cubic splines. Restricted cubic spline analysis was also used to evaluate the 
150 
relation of dietary intakes of LA and AA with the serum concentrations. All P-values were 2-
151 
tailed (α=0.05). Data were analyzed using SPSS 21.0 for Windows (Armonk, NY: IBM 
152 
Corp.) and Stata 13.1 (Stata Corp., College Station, Texas; for spline analysis). 
153 
 
154 
RESULTS 
155 
Of the serum n-6 PUFAs, LA was the most abundant, accounting for 80.5% of the serum 
156 
n-6 PUFAs, followed by AA (14.5% of the n-6 PUFAs) (Supplemental Table 1). The LA 
157 
and AA concentrations were slightly higher among those without disease history. Only serum 
158 
GLA and DGLA showed a moderate correlation with each other (r=0.54), all other 
159 
intercorrelations were weak (r≤0.19) (Supplemental Table 1). In the subset of 801 men, for 
160 
whom data also from the KIHD 4-y and 11-y re-examinations were available (Supplemental 
161 
Figure 2), the Spearman correlation coefficients between the baseline, 4-y and 11-y serum n-6 
162 
PUFA values were all ≥0.5 (Supplemental Table 2).  
163 
The baseline characteristics for the whole study population and for those with or without 
164 
history of CVD, cancer or diabetes are presented in the Table 1. Men with disease history 
165 
were older, had a higher BMI, and lower education, income and intakes of energy and fruits, 
166 
berries and vegetables.  
167 
In univariate analyses, serum LA and AA had similar, beneficial associations with several 
168 
mortality risk factors at baseline (Supplemental Tables 3&6). For example, higher serum LA 
169 
or AA concentrations were related to younger age, lower BMI, less smoking or lower 
170 
likelihood to have diabetes or hypertension or to use diabetes or hypertension medications 
171 
during follow-up. In contrast, higher serum LA was related to lower serum long-chain n-3 
172 
PUFA concentration and to lower alcohol intake, whereas higher serum AA was related to 
173 
higher serum long-chain n-3 PUFA concentration and higher alcohol intake. The associations 
174 
were also quite different with dietary factors (Supplemental Tables 3&6). Higher LA 
175 
concentration was related to, for example, higher intake of vegetable margarines and fruits, 
176 
berries and vegetables, whereas higher AA concentration was related to higher intake of red 
177 
meat. Those with higher serum GLA or DGLA concentration were, for example, more likely 
178 
to be younger, have a lower serum long-chain n-3 PUFA concentration, use diabetes 
179 
 6 
 
medication during follow-up and have lower PUFA intake and be less likely to smoke 
180 
(Supplemental Tables 4&5).  
181 
Estimated dietary LA intake had a nonlinear association with serum LA concentration; the 
182 
association was relatively linear with intakes up to about 4 percent of energy, with smaller 
183 
increase in serum levels with higher intakes (P-value for overall association <0.001, for non-
184 
linearity P<0.001, Supplemental Figure 3). Similarly, higher AA intake was associated with 
185 
higher serum AA (P-overall <0.001, P-non-linearity=0.03; Supplemental Figure 3). We did 
186 
not have information on GLA and DGLA intakes. LA intake had a weak, inverse association 
187 
with serum DGLA (β=-0.012; 95% CI: -0.003, -0.021), but no association with serum GLA 
188 
(β=-0.002; 95% CI: -0.006, 0.001) or AA (β=-0.026; 95% CI: -0.057, 0.005).  
189 
During the mean follow-up of 22.4 years (SD 7.8, 55,565 person-years) 1143 disease 
190 
deaths occurred in the whole study population (incidence rate 2.1/100 person-years). Of these, 
191 
575 (50.3%) were CVD deaths, 317 (27.7%) cancer deaths and 251 (22.0%) deaths due other 
192 
causes. The most common non-CVD/non-cancer causes of death were deaths due dementia 
193 
and Alzheimer’s disease (6.1% of all disease deaths), respiratory-related causes (3.7%) and 
194 
liver disease (2.8%). The incidence rate of death was higher among men with history of major 
195 
diseases (mean±SD follow-up 20.6±8.5 y, 2.8 events/100 person-years) than among men 
196 
without such history (mean follow-up 23.6±6.9 y, 1.6 events/100 person-years). The 
197 
associations of the serum n-6 PUFAs with risk of any disease death are shown in the Table 2. 
198 
Both serum LA and AA were associated with lower risk of total mortality, but GLA and 
199 
DGLA were not associated. Those in the highest vs. lowest LA quintile had multivariable-
200 
adjusted 43% (95% CI: 29, 64%) lower relative risk of death and those in the highest vs. 
201 
lowest AA quintile 20% (95% CI: 2, 35%) lower relative risk (Model 2, Table 2) (AR in the 
202 
lowest LA quintile 58.5% and in the lowest AA quintile 55.6%, ARR 25.4% in the highest 
203 
LA quintile and 11.2% in the highest AA quintile). Each one SD increase in serum LA (4.7% 
204 
of total fatty acids) was associated with multivariable-adjusted 19% (95% CI: 13, 24%) lower 
205 
relative risk of disease death and each one SD increase in serum AA (1.0% of total fatty 
206 
acids) with 12% (95% CI: 6, 18) lower risk (Table 2). The associations were generally similar 
207 
among men with or without history of disease (Table 2). Restricted cubic splines analysis 
208 
showed relatively linear associations of serum LA and AA with lower risk of death (for 
209 
overall associations P<0.001 and P=0.001, respectively) and little evidence for nonlinearity 
210 
(P=0.10 and P=0.24, respectively) (Figure 1). 
211 
When we investigated the associations with the major causes of death, CVD and cancer, 
212 
serum LA had an inverse association with CVD mortality, with multivariable-adjusted 46% 
213 
(95% CI: 26, 60%) lower relative risk in the highest compared to the lowest quintile (AR in 
214 
the reference group 31.5%, ARR 14.7%) (Table 3, Supplemental Figure 4). Also serum AA 
215 
showed a trend towards lower risk of CVD death (Table 3). GLA or DGLA were not 
216 
associated with risk of CVD death (Table 3). None of the n-6 PUFAs were associated with 
217 
risk of cancer death (Table 4, Supplemental Figure 4). The associations were again generally 
218 
similar in the analyses stratified by the disease status (Tables 3&4). 
219 
When we further explored the associations with specific causes of death, serum LA had an 
220 
inverse association with risk of coronary heart disease death (extreme-quintile HR=0.47; 95% 
221 
CI: 0.33, 0.68) and non-CVD/non-cancer death (HR=0.48; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.76) 
222 
(Supplemental Tables 7&8, Supplemental Figure 4). Serum AA had a borderline statistically 
223 
significant inverse association with risk of coronary heart disease death (extreme-quintile 
224 
HR=0.71; 95% CI: 0.50, 1.01) and a trend towards lower risk of non-CVD/non-cancer death 
225 
(P-trend=0.02) (Supplemental Tables 7&8). Serum GLA and DGLA had no association with 
226 
these outcomes, and we again did not find evidence for effect modification by history of 
227 
major diseases (Supplemental Tables 7&8) 
228 
 7 
 
The associations of serum LA and AA were modestly attenuated after further adjustment 
229 
for potential effect mediators: serum LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and C-reactive 
230 
protein. For example, each 1 SD increase in serum LA was associated with 16% (HR=0.84; 
231 
95% CI: 0.77, 0.91) lower risk of any disease death and each 1 SD increase in serum AA with 
232 
8% (HR=0.92; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.99) lower risk. In the case of CVD death, each 1 SD increase 
233 
in LA was associated with 14% (HR=0.86; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.97) lower risk and each 1 SD 
234 
increase in AA with 5% (HR=0.95; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.05) lower risk (other data not shown). 
235 
Because the long follow-up may attenuate the associations with an exposure that is measured 
236 
only at the study baseline, we also evaluated the associations in analyses limited to the first 
237 
half (11 years) of follow-up. The associations were generally similar to those with the longer 
238 
follow-up (Supplemental Table 9).  
239 
 
240 
DISCUSSION 
241 
In this prospective cohort study among middle-aged and older men from eastern Finland, 
242 
higher serum concentration of the major n-6 PUFA, LA, had an inverse association with risk 
243 
of disease death and with CVD, CHD and non-CVD/non-cancer mortality. Similar, although 
244 
weaker, inverse associations were observed with serum AA. Both correlated with their dietary 
245 
intakes, but not with each other. Serum GLA and DGLA were not associated with risk of 
246 
death, and none of the n-6 PUFA were associated with cancer mortality. The results were 
247 
generally similar among those with or without baseline history of major chronic disease. 
248 
There is an ongoing debate about the health benefits of replacing saturated fat with n-6 
249 
PUFA. Some arguments may stem from the findings of the meta-analyses of the dietary fat 
250 
modification trials that seemed to give little support for the cardiovascular benefits of 
251 
replacing saturated fat with n-6 PUFA (2-6). In some of these trials, replacement of saturated 
252 
fat sources with vegetable margarines or oils high in n-6 PUFA failed to reduce CVD or total 
253 
mortality (2-6). However, the majority of the trials were conducted in the 1960’s and 1970’s, 
254 
when the n-6 PUFA-rich margarines were also major sources of industrially-produced trans 
255 
fatty acids, a major risk factor for all-cause and CHD mortality (17). Many trials also had 
256 
serious limitations, such as low compliance or low number of events, or methodological 
257 
issues, such as single-blinding or lack of appropriate randomization (6,18), which prevent 
258 
drawing firm conclusions based on these trials. 
259 
Many observational studies do, however, support cardiovascular benefits of higher LA 
260 
intake and the benefits do not appear to depend on whether LA replaces saturated fat or 
261 
carbohydrates in the diet (19). Similar findings have been observed with objective biomarkers 
262 
of intake, circulating or adipose tissue LA, in some (20-23), although not in all studies (24-
263 
27). These studies included participants without CVD at baseline, but our findings suggest 
264 
that the associations are similar also among men with history of major chronic disease (of 
265 
whom 90% had established CVD). Reverse causation is a cause for concern especially when 
266 
the study includes participants with established disease, because they may have changed their 
267 
diet due to the disease. Because those with a history of disease are at higher risk of new 
268 
events or death than healthy participants, these changes in diet may result in spurious findings 
269 
that better diet (e.g. higher LA intake) is associated with increased risk of incident events or 
270 
death. However, in our study the inverse associations of LA with any deaths and with 
271 
cardiovascular mortality actually appeared slightly stronger among those with an established 
272 
disease. Our findings thus support the cardiovascular benefits of higher LA intake in both the 
273 
primary and secondary prevention of CVD.  
274 
In addition to the inverse association with CVD risk in observational studies, higher LA 
275 
intake has had a beneficial impact on, e.g. serum lipids (28), liver fat accumulation (29) and 
276 
glucose metabolism (30). Although some animal studies have suggested high LA intake to 
277 
induce obesity (31), human studies give little support for these findings (29,32), and in the 
278 
 8 
 
current study, LA was inversely related to BMI cross-sectionally. However, high n-6 PUFA 
279 
intake has also been suggested to increase risk of non-CVD outcomes, for example because of 
280 
their pro-inflammatory properties (7). LA and especially AA are indeed substrates to several 
281 
pro-inflammatory substances, but both are also substrates to compounds with anti-
282 
inflammatory or pro-resolving properties, such as lipoxins, epoxy fatty acids and nitrated LA 
283 
(33-36). In experimental studies even very high intakes of LA or AA have not increased 
284 
inflammation markers (37-39). High n-6 PUFA intake could also theoretically reduce the 
285 
endogenous production of the long-chain n-3 PUFA and subsequently the anti-inflammatory 
286 
and other beneficial effects of the long-chain n-3 PUFA, because of the shared metabolic 
287 
pathways of the n-3 and n-6 PUFAs. However, typical dietary LA intakes do not seem to 
288 
affect the long-chain n-3 PUFA status (40). Our findings are thus well in line with several 
289 
previous studies that observed an inverse association of dietary or biomarker LA with total 
290 
mortality (20-22,25,26,41). The n-6 PUFA could also contribute to cancer risk, because some 
291 
AA-derived pro-inflammatory eicosanoids can affect cell proliferation, apoptosis, 
292 
angiogenesis and migration (36,42). However, the observational studies of n-6 PUFA intake 
293 
and cancer incidence have produced inconsistent findings, some studies finding a higher risk 
294 
and some studies a lower risk (42). Only few studies have investigated the association with 
295 
cancer mortality, either finding an inverse association with dietary LA (41) or no association 
296 
with circulating n-6 PUFA (22,27). We found no evidence for increased cancer mortality risk 
297 
with higher n-6 PUFA exposure, but in contrast observed an inverse association of both LA 
298 
and AA with mortality also due to causes other than CVD and cancer. These findings, 
299 
together with previous observations (22), indicate that higher intake of n-6 PUFA provides 
300 
cardiovascular benefits without increasing the risk of non-CVD mortality.  
301 
The use of objective biomarkers of intake has the benefit of reducing the measurement 
302 
error inherent in the subjective dietary assessment methods. However, for the biomarker to be 
303 
useful, it needs to correlate with dietary intakes. LA intake correlates with LA in different 
304 
tissues and blood compartments (43,44), and an inverse association with mortality has been 
305 
observed with LA measured in adipose tissue (26), plasma phospholipids (22), cholesterol 
306 
esters (21), and total serum (20). It is less clear that what are preferable tissues for 
307 
measurement for the other n-6 PUFA. AA intake has usually had no or only a weak 
308 
correlation with biomarker AA (22,26,43). Similarly, biomarker AA has not been associated 
309 
with mortality in studies using adipose tissue (26), erythrocytes (27), plasma phospholipids 
310 
(22,24), or cholesterol esters (21) as the tissue of measurement. In contrast, we found both a 
311 
correlation between dietary and serum AA and similar, although weaker, inverse associations 
312 
with mortality than with serum LA. There was no association of dietary LA with serum AA or 
313 
between serum LA and AA, consistent with other studies (22,26,45). This suggests that 
314 
endogenous conversion of LA to AA is tightly regulated and that the findings with AA are not 
315 
due to its correlations with LA. However, our novel findings of the inverse associations of 
316 
serum AA with mortality risk highlight the need for further investigations of the health effects 
317 
of AA in different blood compartments and tissues. 
318 
After conversion from LA, GLA is rapidly elongated to DGLA, which can then be 
319 
converted to AA (36). As in the case with AA, GLA and especially DGLA are precursors to 
320 
both pro- and anti-inflammatory compounds (36,46). Some compounds derived from DGLA 
321 
also possess anti-proliferative properties (36,46). Few prospective studies have investigated 
322 
the associations of GLA or DGLA with mortality, and no associations have been observed 
323 
(21,22,26), suggesting that these minor, mainly endogenously produced n-6 PUFA do not 
324 
have a major independent role in mortality risk. 
325 
The strengths of our study are the use of objective biomarkers for n-6 PUFA exposure, 
326 
extensive examinations and adjustment of potential confounders, large numbers of incident 
327 
events and no loss to follow-up. A major weakness is the single baseline fatty acid 
328 
 9 
 
measurement for all men. Because dietary habits can change during a long follow-up, this 
329 
would add random error and thus attenuate the associations. However, in the subgroup of men 
330 
with repeated measurements, we observed rather strong correlations (≥0.5) for all n-6 PUFA 
331 
even 11 y after the baseline. The associations between the n-6 PUFA and incident events were 
332 
also generally similar in the analyses with the shorter, 11-y follow-up. Higher serum LA was 
333 
associated with more favorable lifestyle and dietary factors, so residual confounding by 
334 
unmeasured or imprecisely measured factors cannot be excluded. Our study also included 
335 
only Caucasian middle-aged and older men, and the findings may not be generalizable to 
336 
women and other ethnicity. 
337 
In conclusion, we found an inverse association of both serum LA and AA with risk of total, 
338 
CVD and non-CVD/non-cancer mortality and no association with cancer mortality. The minor 
339 
n-6 PUFA, GLA and DGLA, had no association with mortality risk. The LA findings confirm 
340 
the results of the previous observational studies and suggest overall benefits with higher LA 
341 
intake with little concern for risk. Thus, these results support the current recommendations to 
342 
increase the intake of LA for CVD prevention (18). The findings with AA were novel and 
343 
need to be replicated in other cohorts.

type 2 diabetes (yes/no), smoking (pack-years), education (years), income (euro), leisure-time physical activity (kcal/day), intake of alcohol 
(g/week), serum long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (%), hypertension (yes/no), family history of cardiovascular disease, cancer or 
diabetes (yes/no), use of hypercholesterolemia, hypertension or diabetes medications at baseline or during follow-up (yes/no), and intakes of 
saturated fatty acids (percent of energy), monounsaturated fatty acids (percent of energy), trans fatty acids (percent of energy), fiber (g/day), and 
fruits, berries and vegetables (g/day). The solid lines represent the central risk estimates and the shades are the 95% confidence interval, relative 
to the reference level (12.5th percentile). The dotted vertical lines correspond to 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentile of the fatty acid levels.
