Summary
Background Randomised placebo-controlled trials have shown that daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with 
tenofovir–emtricitabine reduces the risk of HIV infection. However, this benefi
 t could be counteracted by risk 
compensation in users of PrEP. We did the PROUD study to assess this eff
 ect.
Methods PROUD is an open-label randomised trial done at 13 sexual health clinics in England. We enrolled HIV-
negative gay and other men who have sex with men who had had anal intercourse without a condom in the previous 
90 days. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily combined tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (245 mg) 
and emtricitabine (200 mg) either immediately or after a deferral period of 1 year. Randomisation was done via 
web-based access to a central computer-generated list with variable block sizes (stratifi
 ed by clinical site). Follow-up 
was quarterly. The primary outcomes for the pilot phase were time to accrue 500 participants and retention; secondary 
outcomes included incident HIV infection during the deferral period, safety, adherence, and risk compensation. The 
trial is registered with ISRCTN (number ISRCTN94465371) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02065986).
Findings We enrolled 544 participants (275 in the immediate group, 269 in the deferred group) between Nov 29, 2012, 
and April 30, 2014. Based on early evidence of eff
 ectiveness, the trial steering committee recommended on 
Oct 13, 2014, that all deferred participants be off
 ered PrEP. Follow-up for HIV incidence was complete for 243 (94%) 
of 259 patient-years in the immediate group versus 222 (90%) of 245 patient-years in the deferred group. Three HIV 
infections occurred in the immediate group (1·2/100 person-years) versus 20 in the deferred group 
(9·0/100 person-years) despite 174 prescriptions of post-exposure prophylaxis in the deferred group (relative 
reduction 86%, 90% CI 64–96, p=0·0001; absolute diff
 erence 7·8/100 person-years, 90% CI 4·3–11·3). 13 men 
(90% CI 9–23) in a similar population would need access to 1 year of PrEP to avert one HIV infection. We recorded 
no serious adverse drug reactions; 28 adverse events, most commonly nausea, headache, and arthralgia, resulted in 
interruption of PrEp. We detected no diff
 erence in the occurrence of sexually transmitted infections, including rectal 
gonorrhoea and chlamydia, between groups, despite a suggestion of risk compensation among some PrEP recipients. 
Interpretation In this high incidence population, daily tenofovir–emtricitabine conferred even higher protection 
against HIV than in placebo-controlled trials, refuting concerns that eff
 ectiveness would be less in a real-world 
setting. There was no evidence of an increase in other sexually transmitted infections. Our fi
 ndings strongly support 
the addition of PrEP to the standard of prevention for men who have sex with men at risk of HIV infection.

Introduction
HIV is a disease of major importance in the UK, with an 
estimated 107 800 individuals with HIV at the end of 2013.1 
Prognosis is excellent, but treatment is lifelong with an 
inexorable increase in costs to the National Health 
Service.2 Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with 
men are the most at risk of acquiring HIV in the UK.1 
There has been no decrease in the numbers of new 
diagnoses reported each year for the past decade (3250 in 
2013), and estimates suggest that HIV incidence has 
increased in this population.3 These trends have occurred 
despite increased HIV testing and a move towards earlier 
initiation of antiretroviral therapy, which renders most 
patients non-infectious.4,5 Although HIV testing and 
promotion of condom use will always be core strategies 
for reducing risk, a more radical approach is needed for 
people who do not have HIV and whose condom use is 
inconsistent. One such approach is pre-exposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP), the provision of antiretroviral drugs 
before HIV exposure to prevent infection.
The biological effi
  cacy of daily oral tenofovir-based 
regimens used as PrEP to reduce HIV acquisition has 
been established through randomised placebo-controlled 
trials including men who have sex with men,6

heterosexual individuals,7,8 and intravenous drug users.9 
One purpose of using placebo in these studies was to 
avoid confounding bias due to risk compensation, which 
occurs if individuals perceive themselves to be protected 
by PrEP and so become more likely to engage in riskier 
sexual practices.10,11 If this eff
 ect exists, it could undermine 
the biological protection conferred by PrEP and its value 
as a public health intervention.10,12–14
We designed the PROUD study (appendix) to assess 
the eff
 ectiveness of PrEP. The eff
 ectiveness was the net 
eff
 ect of effi
  cacy, adherence, and any change in sexual 
behaviour as a result of PrEP. Here, we report the pilot 
phase, in which we assessed recruitment and retention 
to test the feasibility of a large-scale trial. However, the 
unexpectedly large number of HIV infections enabled us 
to present fi
 ndings on the eff
 ectiveness of PrEP, as well 
as safety, adherence, and risk compensation. 
Methods
Study design and participants
We did this pragmatic, open-label, randomised controlled 
trial at 13 sexual health clinics in England. Eligible 
participants were male at birth, were aged 18 years or 
older, had previously attended the enrolling clinic, had 
been screened for HIV and other sexually transmitted 
infections, were HIV negative by a routinely used assay in 
the previous 4 weeks or on the day of enrolment, and had 
reported anal intercourse without a condom in the 
previous 90 days and likely in the opinion of the 
participant to have anal intercourse without a condom in 
the next 90 days. We excluded participants with acute 
viral illness possibly due to HIV seroconversion, any 
contraindication to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or 
emtricitabine, and those being treated with or with 
treatment indicated for hepatitis B infection. The study 
was reviewed and approved by London Bridge Research 
Ethics Committee. The study protocol is available online. 
All patients provided written informed consent.
Randomisation and masking
We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive PrEP 
either starting at the enrolment visit (immediate group) 
or after a deferral period of 1 year (deferred group). The 
computer-generated randomisation list with variable 
block sizes (of four, six, and eight; stratifi
 ed by clinical 
site) was prepared by one of the trial statisticians (DID) 
and incorporated within the database held at the 
coordinating centre. Randomisation was web-based and 
done by approved members of the research team at each 
clinic. Regular sexual partners were encouraged to enrol 
together and both partners allocated to the same group to 
minimise the possibility of drug sharing. Neither patients 
nor investigators were masked to the treatment allocation.
Procedures
We used procedures that we envisaged for a public health 
PrEP programme, including the lack of a screening visit, 
and the use of HIV and sexually transmitted infection 
results collected at other clinics and during non-study 
visits. All laboratory investigations were done locally with 
routine assays in compliance with the UK standards for 
the management of sexually transmitted infections.15 
These guidelines recommend urethral, rectal, and 
pharyngeal nucleic acid amplifi
 cation tests for Chlamydia 
trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, with culture for 
N gonorrhoeae as indicated; serology for syphilis; serology 
or nucleic acid assays for hepatitis B and C as indicated. 
The protocol did not stipulate the collection and storage 
of a baseline sample for HIV although this was routine 
practice in some clinics.
At the enrolment visit, baseline demographic, clinical, 
and sexual behavioural data were recorded. Participants 
were screened for sexually transmitted infections if they 
reported a new partner since their previous screen, and 
assessed for hepatitis B immunisation status. A rapid 
antibody point-of-care HIV test was done if no HIV 
antigen–antibody test had been done in the previous

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We reviewed all randomised controlled trials of pre-exposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP) listed in the HIV Prevention Research & 
Development Database, which has comprehensive information 
on biomedical clinical trials of HIV prevention that are planned, 
ongoing, or completed. We identifi
 ed several completed and 
ongoing placebo-controlled trials designed to assess biological 
effi
  cacy and demonstration projects designed to facilitate 
implementation, but no open-label randomised trials that 
assess real-life eff
 ectiveness.
Added value of this study
PROUD is the fi
 rst-open-label randomised controlled trial of 
PrEP, and used a pragmatic schedule and procedures to 
represent how PrEP would be used in routine clinical practice. 
Our results refute concerns that the eff
 ectiveness of PrEP would 
be compromised when used in clinical practice, and the 
reduction in HIV incidence exceeded that reported from any 
placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of HIV infection among 
men not on PrEP was high (nine cases per 100 person-years), 
implying that the off
 er of PrEP is likely to attract individuals 
who are most likely to benefi
 t from it.
Implications of all the available evidence
A public health programme of PrEP could have a major role in 
preventing a condition that requires lifelong treatment and 
curtailing the HIV epidemic. Structural and fi
 nancial barriers 
that might impede its implementation should be urgently 
addressed.

4 weeks, and all participants had an HIV antigen–antibody 
test after randomisation. Interventions to reduce risk were 
off
 ered according to routine practice at the clinic.
The PrEP regimen was a single daily tablet containing 
245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and 200 mg of 
emtricitabine (Truvada; Gilead Sciences, Foster City, 
CA, USA). Participants allocated to the immediate 
group were initially prescribed 30 tablets together with 
information about dosing and potential side-eff
 ects, 
including that maximum protection against HIV 
would be achieved only after reaching steady state 
concentrations (roughly 2 weeks, estimated from 
fi
 ve half-lives of the intracellular drug concentration).16 
A blood sample was obtained to measure serum 
creatinine. An appointment was made within 1 month, 
primarily as a safety and tolerability check, and to 
prescribe 90 tablets. The same procedures were followed 
when participants in the deferred group started PrEP. 
Follow-up is scheduled to continue until the fi
 nal 
enrolled participant has completed 2 years in the study.
All participants were asked to attend clinic every 
3 months. These visits included an HIV test and a screen 
for bacterial sexually transmitted infections. Hepatitis C 
screening was indicated if the participant reported 
injecting or snorting drugs, fi
 sting, or the use of sex 
toys. Suffi
  cient PrEP was prescribed to extend 1 month 
beyond the next quarterly appointment. A subsequent 
protocol amendment allowed 6 months of PrEP to be 
prescribed in exceptional circumstances—eg, travel 
overseas. Serum creatinine was checked yearly, but 
additional tests were triggered at intervening visits if 
more than a trace of protein was detected by urine 
dipstick and could not be explained by infection.17 
Potential side-eff
 ects of study drug and discontinuations 
for a medical event were asked about at each visit. In the 
event of HIV seroconversion, the earliest available HIV-
positive sample was tested for genotypic drug resistance, 
in accordance with UK guidelines.18
Participants 
were 
asked 
to 
complete 
monthly 
questionnaires and daily diaries about sexual behaviour 
and adherence to PrEP, either online or on paper. A more 
detailed questionnaire, including information on the 
number and type of sexual partners in the previous 
90 days, was administered at enrolment and at yearly visits. 
Plasma concentrations of tenofovir were measured in a 
sample of 52 participants who reported that they were 
taking PrEP and who attended one of fi
 ve sites on a day the 
laboratory was able to process the samples. We attempted 
to identify additional HIV and sexually transmitted 
infection results in participants lost to follow-up by 
searching electronic clinic records in other PROUD clinics.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was time to accrual of 
500 participants and retention. The secondary outcomes 
were HIV infection, safety, adherence, and risk 
compensation (see protocol). HIV infection was defi
 ned 
as a reactive HIV antigen–antibody test result (confi
 rmed 
by the detection of HIV RNA), in participants without 
HIV infection at enrolment. Although retrospective 
testing of enrolment samples for HIV RNA was possible 
at some sites these results were not considered. 
We included data up to and including the fi
 rst test after 
48 weeks or the closure date of the deferred group on 
Oct 13, 2014, whichever was earlier (the deferral phase). 
We censored person-years of observation at the date of 
the fi
 rst reactive HIV test for participants who became 
infected, or the date of the last test for those who did not. 
We calculated expected person-years of observation 
assuming that participants had attended all study visits, 
as per the study protocol.
Statistical analysis
PROUD 
was 
designed 
with 
a 
sample 
size 
of 
5000 participants, powered to detect a 50% reduction in 
HIV incidence from 2·5 to 1·25 infections per 100 person-
years. For the pilot study, we used an arbitrary 10% sample 
size of 500. Because of the unlikeliness of showing the 
eff
 ectiveness of PrEP in a pilot study, data were initially 
monitored by a single independent expert not masked to 
allocation. As it emerged that HIV incidence was much 
higher than anticipated, an independent data monitoring 
committee was set up in June, 2014. The committee

regarded the diff
 erence between groups in rate of HIV 
infection (rate diff
 erence) as the key measure for public 
health policy, and adopted a lower 2·5% confi
 dence limit 
greater than two infections per 100 person-years as a 
threshold for notifying the steering committee, although 
this was not a formal stopping rule.
Analyses included all participants according to their 
randomised allocation (intention to treat) apart from the 
exclusion of individuals with a reactive HIV antigen–
antibody result at enrolment in analyses of HIV incidence 
(modifi
 ed intention to treat). We compared incidence 
rates between the two groups by both the rate diff
 erence 
and the rate ratio. We calculated exact 90% CIs rather 
than 95% CIs because we were primarily interested in the 
lower confi
 dence limit—ie, the minimal estimate of the 
eff
 ectiveness.19 We derived the number-needed-to-treat to 
directly avert (prevent or delay) one HIV infection from 
the reciprocal of the rate diff
 erence.20 All analyses used 
data collected during the deferral phase of the trial, up to 
the date of extraction on June 10, 2015.
We planned to assess individual-level adherence and 
longitudinal sexual behaviour, but the low proportion of 
participants who completed the monthly questionnaire 
and diary prevented us from doing so. We therefore 
reported overall prescriptions of trial drug and 
cross-sectional analyses of sexual behaviour on the basis 
of baseline and 1 year questionnaires only. We compared 
the number of diff
 erent anal sex partners at 1 year in each 
group using a stratifi
 ed test for trend,21 according to the 
category at the enrolment visit. We used logistic 
regression to analyse the probability of detecting a 
sexually transmitted infection during follow-up, adjusting 
for the number of screens (as a linear term). We did the 
statistical analyses with Stata (version 13.1).
The trial is registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN94465371) 
and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02065986).
Role of the funding source
Employees of the funders had a role in the design of the 
study, data collection, analysis, and interpretation, and 
writing the report. The corresponding author had full 
access to all the data in the study and had fi

responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
We randomly assigned 544 participants between 
Nov 29, 2012, and April 30, 2014: 275 to the immediate 
group and 269 to the deferred group. Two participants 
had enrolled twice to access PrEP and were analysed in 
the deferred group (fi
 gure 1).
The data monitoring committee considered the results 
of an interim analysis on Oct 6, 2014, and alerted the 
steering committee to a signifi
 cantly increased risk of 
HIV infection in the deferred group. On Oct 13, 2014, 
the principal investigators at sites were requested by the 
steering committee to off
 er PrEP to all participants in 
the deferred group who had not yet had this opportunity 
(n=163).
Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the 
two groups (table 1). Median age was 35 years (29–43), 
327 (61%) of 540 participants were university graduates, 
217 (40%) of 540 were born outside of the UK, and 160 
(30%) of 540 were living with a partner. In the previous 
12 months, 331 (64%) of 517 had been diagnosed with a 
sexually transmitted infection (172 [33%] with rectal 
gonorrhoea or chlamydia), 184 (36%) of 510 had received 
at least one course of post-exposure prophylaxis, and the 
median number of HIV tests done was 3 (IQR 2–4). 
231 (44%) of 525 participants had used one or more drugs 
associated with sexual disinhibition (γ-hydroxybutyrate, 
4-methylmethcathinone, or methamphetamine) in the 
past 90 days.
14 (5%) of 275 participants in the immediate group were 
prescribed no further study drug after the initial 
prescription. Overall, suffi
  cient study drug was prescribed 
for 88% of the total follow-up time. Tenofovir was 
detected in plasma of all 52 sampled participants 
(range 38–549 ng/mL) who reported that they were taking 
PrEP. 21 (8%) of 275 participants interrupted or missed 
doses because of 28 adverse event episodes. 13 of the 
episodes were considered related to study drug (table 2).

20 of 21 participants restarted study drug. The most 
common drug-related symptoms were nausea, headache, 
and arthralgia. Three of 21 participants interrupted study 
drug because of high creatinine concentration; two had 
comorbidities and were taking concomitant prescription 
drugs but a relationship to study drug could not be 
excluded, and one was thought to be due to recreational 
drugs. 29 serious adverse events (including one death) 
were reported in 27 participants, but none were attributed 
to study drug (appendix p 5).
Use of post-exposure prophylaxis (the recommended 
regimen at the time of the study was a 28-day course 
of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate–emtricitabine plus 
lopinavir) was common in the deferred group. 174 courses 
were prescribed to 85 participants during the deferral 
phase: 36 participants received one course, 27 received 
two courses, and 22 received three or more courses. 
Post-exposure prophylaxis was also prescribed to 
12 participants (14 prescriptions) in the immediate group 
in this period.
Three participants (two in the immediate group, one in 
the deferred group) had a reactive HIV antigen–antibody 
test at baseline (all were non-reactive by an antibody 
point-of-care test; fi
 gure 1). A further 18 participants had 
no recorded HIV tests after the enrolment visit leaving 
523 (96%) of 544 who contributed to the analysis of HIV 
incidence. We had 243 person-years of follow-up for the 
immediate group (94% of the expected 259 person-years) 
and 222 person-years for the deferred group (90% of the 
expected 245 person-years). 20 patients had new incident 
HIV infections in the deferred group (fi
 gure 2), of 
whom six had been prescribed a total of 12 courses 
of post-exposure prophylaxis during follow-up. In 
six patients, the last negative antigen–antibody test was 
at the enrolment visit. By contrast, only three incident 
HIV infections occurred in the immediate group. One 
participant had a reactive HIV test at the 4-week visit, and 
infection is thought to have pre-dated the start of PrEP, 
based on the history provided. The second participant 
was HIV reactive at 61 weeks and had been prescribed no 
study drug since the enrolment visit. The third participant 
presented with a seroconversion illness at 53 weeks; his 
last clinic attendance was at the 12-week visit when he 
was prescribed 90 tablets of study drug. These fi
 ndings 
suggest that there were no breakthrough HIV infections 
in participants who were taking PrEP.
HIV incidence was signifi
 cantly lower in the 
immediate group (1·2 cases per 100 person-years, 
90% CI 0·4–2·9) than in the deferred group (9·0 per 
100 person-years, 90% CI 6·1–12·8; p=0·0001). This 
diff
 erence corresponds to a proportionate reduction of 
86% (90% CI 64–96) and a rate diff
 erence of 7·8 per 
100 person-years (90% CI 4·3–11·3). 13 men (90% CI 
9–23) in a similar population would need access to 1 year 
of PrEP to avert one HIV infection. HIV diagnoses in 
the deferred group were fairly evenly distributed over 
follow-up (appendix p 7).
All fi
 ve participants in the immediate group who had 
HIV infection were tested for resistance. Two of the three 
participants with a reactive test at enrolment or the 
4-week visit developed mutations at codon 184 in reverse 
transcriptase 
(Met184Ile/Met, 
Met184Ile/Val/Met), 
probably selected by exposure to emtricitabine. No 
resistance was detected in the two participants with later 
infections, which was not surprising given their apparent 
non-adherence to PrEP. No participant had mutations 
associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treatment 
(Lys65Arg, Lys70Glu).
Questionnaires about sexual behaviour in the previous 
90 days were completed and returned by 534 participants 
at baseline (271 in the immediate group vs 263 in the 
deferred group) and by 406 participants at 1 year (212 vs 
194). Total number of diff
 erent anal sex partners varied 
widely at the two timepoints, and we detected no 
signifi
 cant diff
 erence between groups at 1 year (p=0·57;

appendix p 8). However, a larger proportion of participants 
allocated to immediate PrEP than allocated to deferred 
PrEP reported receptive anal sex with ten or more partners 
without a condom (21% vs 12%; p=0·03, test for trend).
152 (57%) of 265 participants in the immediate group 
versus 124 (50%) of 247 in the deferred group were 
diagnosed with one or more bacterial sexually transmitted 
infection during follow-up, most commonly gonorrhoea 
and chlamydia (table 3). The randomised comparison 
was biased by the greater number of screens for sexually 
transmitted infections in the immediate group versus 
the deferred group (mean 4·2 vs 3·6), a consequence 
of more regular study clinic attendance to collect 
prescriptions in the immediate group. After adjustment 
for the number of screens, we found no signifi
 cant 
diff
 erence between the groups, either for individual 
sexually transmitted infections or overall (table 3). 
Particularly, the proportion of participants diagnosed 
with rectal gonorrhoea or chlamydia, which is an 
indicator of receptive anal intercourse without a condom, 
was much the same in the two groups (table 3). 
Six incident hepatitis C infections occurred, three in each 
group. Injecting drug use was the possible route of 
transmission in three of these participants (two in the 
immediate group vs one in the deferred group), and a 
fourth participant (in the deferred group) acquired 
hepatitis C virus infection around the time or shortly 
after HIV infection.
Discussion
Our fi
 ndings refute concerns that the eff
 ectiveness of 
PrEP would be compromised in a real-world setting. 
Indeed, the reduction in HIV incidence we recorded 
exceeds that reported in any placebo-controlled trial.22 
The proportion of sexually transmitted infections, 
including rectal gonorrhoea or chlamydia, did not diff
 er 
signifi
 cantly between groups despite a suggestion of risk 
compensation among a small proportion of PrEP 
recipients.
The study has strengths and weaknesses. First, the 
open-label rather than placebo-controlled design enabled 
us to capture the outcome that is most relevant for 
assessing PrEP within a public health prevention 
programme: the combination of the direct biological 
effi
  cacy of the drug and the indirect eff
 ect of altered 
sexual behaviour among individuals who knew they 
were taking PrEP. Placebo-controlled trials may 
underestimate actual adherence because there is less 
incentive to take a tablet when the participant knows 
that it might be a placebo.11 Second, the lack of data on 
adherence to PrEP and sexual behaviour is a limitation. 
However, the measured drug concentrations validated 
the reports of participants who said they were taking 
study drug, by contrast with placebo-controlled trials.6,23,24 
The absence of longitudinal data for sexual behaviour 
is frustrating, as we cannot assess precisely how 
participants matched adherence to risk, and insights 
into risk compensation are limited to a single timepoint 
at 1 year. However, we were able to use the information 
in the routine clinic records to capture the results of 
screens for HIV and sexually transmitted infection in 
the study database, and achieve a high level of follow-up 
for these endpoints. A larger study would have given 
more precise estimates of the eff
 ect of PrEP on sexually 
transmitted infections. Third, two men enrolled twice to 
access PrEP, and it is possible that others in the deferred 
group co-enrolled without detection or accessed PrEP 
from other sources, resulting in the eff
 ectiveness of 
PrEP being underestimated. Finally, because the trial 
stopped early the probability of type I error is increased.
An 
important 
issue 
in 
PrEP 
implementation 
programmes is eligibility.22 We included participants who 
reported at least one anal sex act without a condom in the 
preceding 90 days; consequently, the reported sexual risk 
behaviour at enrolment was diverse. Despite the broad 
eligibility criteria and extensive use of post-exposure

prophylaxis, we recorded a high HIV incidence of nine 
cases per 100 person-years in the deferred group. This 
fi
 nding was the main determinant of the highly 
favourable estimate of 13 similar men who would need 
access to PrEP for 1 year to avert one HIV infection. 
Additional infections that would have occurred further 
down the transmission chain are not represented in this 
value. The incidence was roughly seven times higher 
than the national estimate of 1·34 cases per 100 person-
years reported for men who have sex with men attending 
sexual health clinics in 2012, derived from avidity assay 
data.25 Although participants in PROUD were much 
more likely to have had rectal infections and to have 
used post-exposure prophylaxis than was the overall 
population of men who have sex with men attending 
sexual health clinics,26 the size of the diff
 erence in HIV 
incidence was nonetheless surprising. The diff
 erence 
suggests that the PROUD study population was highly 
selective, despite broad eligibility, and that the off
 er of 
PrEP generally attracts those men who are most likely to 
benefi
 t from it. This fi
 nding is highly encouraging for 
PrEP implementation, although quantifying the likely 
demand in the UK remains challenging.
A potential disadvantage of PrEP is the generation of 
drug-resistant viruses and the resulting loss of treatment 
options.27 As was the case in the placebo-controlled 
trials,22 patients who had acute infection when PrEP was 
initiated had the highest risk of developing drug 
resistance. Acute infection can only be excluded if HIV 
testing follows a period of no potential exposure to HIV, 
which is not practical in people who have sex often and a 
delay in initiation of PrEP carries the greater risk of an 
HIV infection that could be avoided.
An economic assessment28 based on a mathematical 
model adapted to the UK epidemic in men who have sex 
with men suggests that providing targeted PrEP to this 
group from 2016 would be cost-eff
 ective at current 
prices, or without targeted implementation if tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate–emtricitabine was halved in price. 
The investigators in the IPERGAY trial29 reported the 
same 86% reduction in HIV incidence using an 
on-demand regimen of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate–
emtricitabine: two tablets taken 2–24 h before sex, one 
taken 24 h later, and one taken 48 h later. The median 
number of pills taken each month was 16, which would 
cost roughly half of a daily regimen. As well as fewer 
pills, other advantages of the on-demand regimen 
include the greater ease with which PrEP can be 
interrupted during periods of decreased or no risk.
In the UK, the standard of prevention is already high, 
with free walk-in services providing screening for HIV 
and sexually transmitted infections, treatment for sexually 
transmitted infections, condoms and encouragement to 
use them, post-exposure prophylaxis, and support for 
behaviour change. Nonetheless, there remains a 
substantial burden of new HIV diagnoses in men who 
have sex with men already attending sexual health clinics 
and thus accessing this standard of prevention. The 
impressive reduction in HIV incidence in people taking 
PrEP, without a measurable increase in other sexually 
transmitted infections, is reassuring for clinical, 
community, and public health stakeholders. National 
health services are under fi
 nancial constraints, but they 
cannot aff
 ord to ignore the results of PROUD and 
IPERGAY, which strongly support the addition of PrEP to 
the current standard of prevention for men who have sex 
with men at risk of HIV infection.

We dedicate this paper to the late Professor Martin Fisher, who 
championed treatment and prevention in the UK for two decades, and 
whose leadership and companionship we miss. The study was supported 
by ad hoc funding from the MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University 
College London and an innovations grant from Public Health England, 
and most clinics received support through the UK National Institute of 
Health Research Clinical Research Network. Gilead Sciences provided 
Truvada, distributed drug to clinics, and awarded a grant for the additional 
diagnostic tests including drug concentrations in plasma. We thank the 
PROUD participants who recognised the need for the study design, the 
dedication of the clinic teams, and the oversight that the governance 
committees provided as the study evolved, including the community 
engagement group who helped to boost recruitment and advised us on 
dissemination. A full list of contributors is given in the appendix.
