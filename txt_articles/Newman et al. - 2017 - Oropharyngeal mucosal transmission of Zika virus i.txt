Zika virus is present in urine, saliva, tears, and breast milk, but the transmission risk
associated with these body fluids is currently unknown. Here we evaluate the risk of Zika
virus transmission through mucosal contact in rhesus macaques. Application of high-dose
Zika virus directly to the tonsils of three rhesus macaques results in detectable plasma
viremia in all animals by 2 days post-exposure; virus replication kinetics are similar to those
observed in animals infected subcutaneously. Three additional macaques inoculated sub-
cutaneously with Zika virus served as saliva donors to assess the transmission risk from
contact with oral secretions from an infected individual. Seven naive animals repeatedly
exposed to donor saliva via the conjunctivae, tonsils, or nostrils did not become infected. Our
results suggest that there is a risk of Zika virus transmission via the mucosal route, but that
the risk posed by oral secretions from individuals with a typical course of Zika virus infection
is low.

 Z
ika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that is
associated with Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults and a
range of birth defects, most notably microcephaly, in
congenitally infected infants1–5. ZIKV has become a subject of
global concern as it has rapidly expanded its geographic range in
the past 2 years. One of the many surprising aspects of the current
ZIKV pandemic is the confirmation of one previous report of
sexually transmitted ZIKV infection6–9; there is now evidence
that ZIKV of both the Asian/American and African genetic
lineages can be transmitted sexually. Because mosquito-borne
flavivirus infection has not previously been associated with
human-to-human transmission, understanding transmission risks
is critical for designing effective prevention and control strategies.
In the Americas, ZIKV is transmitted among humans by Aedes
species mosquitoes, primarily Aedes aegypti10–13. The explosive
epidemic in tropical areas where important vector mosquito
species are common has made it challenging to differentiate
between vector-borne and sexual ZIKV transmission, so the
risk of human-to-human transmission has been difficult to assess.
In the continental United States, which has primarily travel-
associated cases, detection of non-vector transmission is much
more straightforward, and 46 cases of sexually transmitted
ZIKV infection have been reported as of 20 April 2017 (https://
www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/united-states.html).
These
cases
have
included
male-to-female,
male-to-male,
and
female-to-male
transmission6, 14–16.
ZIKV RNA has been detected in blood, semen, and vaginal
secretions, consistent with observations of sexual transmission.
Viral RNA and/or infectious virus has also been reported in urine,
saliva, tears, and breast milk, suggesting that these body fluids
may also pose a transmission risk17–20. Indeed, virus was trans-
mitted to a caregiver of an individual with high ZIKV viremia
who eventually succumbed to infection21.
Here we used rhesus macaques to evaluate the risk of ZIKV
transmission through mucosal membrane contact with saliva
(specifically, palatine tonsils, nasal mucosae, and conjunctivae).
We applied high-dose ZIKV stock directly to the tonsils of one
group of animals to assess what we term the “theoretical” risk
of mucosal transmission using a dose (8 × 105 PFU/ml) that is
20-fold higher than that typically found in saliva. In another
experiment, we applied saliva from ZIKV-infected macaques to
naive animals to determine whether ZIKV might also be trans-
mitted by more casual contact. All animals that received the high
dose of virus applied directly to the tonsils became infected
with ZIKV. However, animals that were repeatedly challenged
with saliva from ZIKV-positive animals remained uninfected.
Together, these results suggest that, for a typical ZIKV infection,
the risk of mucosal transmission is very low.
Results
ZIKV application to tonsils results in systemic infection. To
evaluate the risk of ZIKV transmission via the oropharyngeal
mucosa, we applied 8 × 105 PFU Zika virus/H.sapiens-tc/FRA/

 pipet (Fig. 1). One macaque infected by this route (664817) had
detectable plasma viremia by 1 day post-infection (dpi) and all
three had detectable plasma viremia by 2 days post-infection (dpi)
(Fig. 2a, b). Peak plasma viremia was observed at 6 dpi in all three
animals and ranged from 2.4 × 105 to 1.1 × 107 vRNA copies per
ml. ZIKV plasma viremia was undetectable in all animals
by 14 dpi. Plasma viremia of animals infected after tonsillar
inoculation (Fig. 2b, orange traces) was compared to plasma
viremia
of
three
animals
infected
subcutaneously
with
1 × 104 PFU of ZIKV-FP (Fig. 2b, blue traces). These sub-
cutaneously inoculated animals also served as saliva donors to
recipient animals described below and in Fig. 1. Overall, plasma
viremia in macaques infected via the oral mucosae was similar in
magnitude and duration to that of macaques inoculated sub-
cutaneously. Two notable exceptions were that viremia only
became detectable 2 days after infection in two of the three
macaques infected via the tonsils, and the peak plasma viral load
in these animals occurred 1–3 days later than in animals infected
subcutaneously (Fig. 2a, b).
ZIKV RNA was also detectable in other bodily fluids following
tonsil exposure. ZIKV RNA was detected in the urine of animal
664817 at 8 dpi (1.6 × 103 vRNA copies per ml) and 590870 at
8–10 dpi (range = 7.4 × 103–1.8 × 104 vRNA copies per ml), but
not in 511690 (Fig. 2a, c). We collected saliva when possible, but
because the volume of saliva that could be collected was often
insufficient to accurately assess viral load, we also collected oral
secretions
using
absorbent
swabs
that
were
eluted
in
a
standardized volume of viral transport media (VTM). ZIKV
RNA detection in oral swab samples was variable from most
animals and undetectable from animal 511690 (Fig. 2a, d). ZIKV
RNA was detected in saliva from animal 590870 on days 6–9 post
infection and from animal 511690 on days 8 and 10 post infection
(Fig. 3). Overall, when saliva samples were available, ZIKV RNA
was detected more consistently and at more time points than in
oral swabs (Fig. 3). By 14 dpi, ZIKV RNA was undetectable in the
tested body fluids of all animals infected by tonsil inoculation.
Sera from macaques that were infected by application of ZIKV
to the tonsils neutralized ZIKV-FP across a range of serum
dilutions. Indeed, neutralization curves prepared using sera from
all 3 animals revealed a similar profile as compared to sera from
animals infected subcutaneously (see Supplementary Fig. 1). All
animals developed neutralizing antibodies (nAb) with a 90%
plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT90) titer of 1:160
(664817 and 511690) or 1:80 (590870) by 28 dpi. Together, these
results show that application of high doses of ZIKV to the oral
mucosae can result in systemic infection and induce humoral
immune responses in a manner similar to subcutaneous infection.
Donor saliva does not induce systemic infection. The highest
concentration of ZIKV RNA we observed in the oral secretions of
infected macaques in previous studies was 2.9 × 104 vRNA copies
per ml, while the dose of ZIKV stock applied to the tonsils of the
animals described above contained 8 × 105 PFU (~8 × 108 vRNA
copies per ml). To examine whether saliva from ZIKV-infected
macaques was infectious and represented an actual transmission
risk to uninfected macaques through oropharyngeal mucosal
exposure, we collected saliva from the three subcutaneously
inoculated rhesus macaques described above. These animals
served as saliva donors to 7 naive recipients—saliva or oral swabs
were collected from donors daily from 3–10 dpi (cohorts 1 and 3)
or 3–12 dpi (cohort 2) and applied to the tonsils, nostrils, or
conjunctivae of 1 or more recipients (See Fig. 1 for details). This

 3–10 or 3–12 dpi timeframe encompassed the period of time in
which ZIKV RNA was detected in non-blood body fluids of
animals infected subcutaneously in our previous studies22, 23.
All saliva donors had detectable ZIKV plasma viremia by 1 dpi,
peaking 3–5 dpi, (range = 7.35 × 105–5.42 × 106 vRNA copies per
ml) and resolving by 14 dpi (Fig. 2a, b). ZIKV RNA was detected
in the passively collected urine of all 3 donors. Peak urine viral
loads were detected 7–10 dpi (range = 2.68 × 104–1.95 × 105
vRNA copies per ml) (Fig. 2c).
We monitored ZIKV RNA in saliva over time through
collection of oral swabs and, whenever possible, saliva, from
donor animals, to measure vRNA in the inoculae used to
challenge the recipients (Fig. 2a, d, and 3). We detected ZIKV
RNA in the oral swab eluate of two saliva donors (448436 and
861138); levels peaked at 2.77 × 103 vRNA copies per ml at 7 dpi
and 1.18 × 104 vRNA copies per ml at 10 dpi, respectively. The
last saliva donor (756591) did not have detectable ZIKV RNA in
oral swab samples. We were unable to consistently collect saliva
from 448436, but ZIKV RNA in the saliva of the 861138 was
detectable 4–14 dpi and peaked at 1.12 × 104 vRNA copies per ml
(Fig. 3). 756591 had detectable ZIKV RNA in saliva that peaked at
2.32 × 103 vRNA copies per ml at 5 dpi. Considered together, all
donor animals had at least two timepoints with detectable vRNA
in either the saliva or oral swab samples during the time when
saliva was used to challenge the recipient animals. At 28 dpi,
serum collected from all three donor animals yielded PRNT90
values of 1:160, similar to the recipients of tonsillar challenges
(see Supplementary Fig. 1 for neutralization curves). Importantly,
ZIKV RNA was undetectable in all seven recipient animals in
all body fluids tested throughout the study. Furthermore, ZIKV-
specific neutralizing antibodies were undetectable in recipient
animals ≥21 days after the final challenge with saliva from
infected donors (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Infectivity of saliva from infected donors in IFNAR −/− mice.
Because no recipients of saliva from infected donors had detect-
able systemic ZIKV infections, we tested the infectivity of donor
saliva in IFNAR−/− mice. These mice are highly susceptible to
ZIKV infection24, 25, even at challenge doses as low as 1 × 102
fluorescent focus units24 which is approximately equivalent to
1 × 102 PFU (Michael Diamond, personal communication). We
inoculated 5- to 6-week-old IFNAR−/− mice in the foot pad with
ZIKV RNA-positive samples collected from two subcutaneously
infected donor macaques. Saliva from 861138 collected at 10 dpi
contained 1.1 × 104 vRNA copies per ml; because the ratio of
ZIKV RNA content to PFU in our stock was approximately
1000:122, 23, we estimate that the 50 μl inoculum contained
~1 × 10−0.25 PFU. The second sample was oral swab eluate from
448436 collected at 7 dpi. This contained 2.8 × 103 vRNA copies
per ml, so we estimate that the 50 μl inoculum administered
to the foot pad contained ~1 × 10−0.86 PFU. We monitored mice
for 25 days for weight loss and mortality. All control and
experimental mice survived with no evidence of morbidity
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Furthermore, ZIKV RNA was undetect-
able in mouse serum at 3 dpi (the approximate peak of viremia in
mice infected previously24, 25) and additional serum collected
from these animals at 25 dpi did not inhibit in vitro replication of
ZIKV, suggesting that they did not seroconvert. These data sug-
gest that saliva from ZIKV-infected macaques did not contain
enough replication-competent virus to initiate infection in these
sensitive hosts. The same saliva and oral swab samples were
concurrently inoculated onto Vero cells to attempt to quantify the
infectious dose the mice might have received; however, both the
saliva and oral swab sample used for the mouse challenge
experiments gave no plaques on these cells (Supplementary
Table 1). Together, these results suggest that macaques with
ZIKV virus loads in the usual range after subcutaneous infection
shed very small quantities of infectious ZIKV in saliva.
Saliva reduces the infectivity of ZIKV in Vero cells. To evaluate
whether antiviral components of saliva reduce the infectivity of
ZIKV, we performed a dose titration experiment using freshly
collected saliva from flavivirus-naive macaques. ZIKV-FP was
mixed with saliva at doses ranging from 1 × 102 to 8 × 105 PFU
and assessed for infectivity by plaque assay on Vero cells. Virus
diluted in PBS at the same concentrations was used as positive
controls for comparison. The titers for virus diluted in freshly
collected macaque saliva were 1–2 logs lower than for virus
diluted in a comparable volume of PBS (Supplementary Fig. 3).
A linear regression model was used to examine the difference in
titer by plaque assay between ZIKV diluted in saliva and ZIKV
diluted in PBS. On the basis of this regression model, diluting
ZIKV in saliva results in a statistically significant reduction in the
number of PFU at all dilutions compared to PBS (coefficient
estimate = −2.6, SE = 0.4, t = −6.1, P < 0.001). Overall, the treat-
ment group (saliva or PBS) and sample dilution explained 97% of
the observed variation in log PFU (based on an R2 value for the
model of 0.97). These results suggest that one or more factors in
macaque saliva may reduce ZIKV infectivity.

 between humans has been documented in several cases, but the
risk of transmission from more casual contact has been difficult
to evaluate. Human-to-human transmission via non-sexual con-
tact has been reported in a single case to date. This case involved a
source patient with extremely high viremia; contact with tears or
sweat from the source patient was hypothesized to be the mode of
transmission21. Here we used a nonhuman primate model to
investigate whether exposure to ZIKV via mucous membranes,
particularly the oropharyngeal mucosae, represents an infection
risk.
Application of a high dose (8 × 105 PFU) of Asian-lineage
ZIKV to the palatine tonsils resulted in systemic infection in three
of three rhesus macaques, suggesting that productive infection
can indeed be initiated at the oropharyngeal mucosae. The
kinetics and magnitude of ZIKV replication in plasma in the
threemucosally-infected animals were similar to those observed in
animals infected subcutaneously with the same stock of ZIKV-FP
(Fig. 2a, b), and all three animals developed strong nAb titers
against homologous ZIKV-FP by 28 dpi. Detection of ZIKV RNA
in oral swabs, saliva, and urine was variable in the animals that
received a direct tonsil inoculation, findings that were also similar
to those from animals infected subcutaneously in this and a
previous study22.
Limitations associated with sample collection could have
influenced our ability to detect vRNA in fluids other than blood.
For example, time from urination to sample collection varied
because urine was collected passively from pans in the animals’
housing. Similarly, there is wide variation in the degree to which
individual animals salivate while under sedation. As a result, it
was not always possible to collect saliva from each animal at each
time point. Oral swabs provided a more consistent means for
collecting oral secretions, but as the relatively small amount of
secretions absorbed by the swabs must be eluted in medium,
detection of ZIKV RNA or infectivity may not be as sensitive in
swab sample as in undiluted saliva. Accordingly, ZIKV RNA was
more consistently detected in the saliva vs. oral swabs when both
sample types were available (Fig. 3). Although ZIKV RNA was
detectable in the saliva of ZIKV donor animals 861138 and
756591 and in oral swab samples from 861138 and 448436,
transfer of saliva from donors to the mucosae of naive recipients
did not result in ZIKV transmission. In addition, donor saliva
produced no detectable plaques on Vero cells. Moreover,
IFNAR−/− mice inoculated with saliva or oral swab samples from
infected donor macaques showed no overt signs of disease and
did not seroconvert. Our previous studies suggest that the ratio of
vRNA copies to infectious particles from both virus stock and
sera from infected animals is ~1000:122, 23. The highest viral
load that we detected in a saliva sample in this study was only
1.1 × 104 vRNA copies per ml; given that we were never able to
collect a full 1 ml of saliva, it seems likely that saliva transferred
to recipients (tonsil maximum of 100–200 μl, conjunctivae
maximum of 50 μl, and nasal passage maximum of 100 μl) in our
study likely contained less than three infectious ZIKV virions.
In addition to sample collection limitations, saliva may repre-
sent a natural barrier to virus transmission in the oral cavity. A
number of different viruses, such as HIV and influenza A, are
detected in the saliva of infected individuals, but oral mucosal
infection in many cases is considered low risk29–31. This may be
due in part to the antimicrobial constituents present in saliva,
which include mucins, lysozyme, peroxidase, defensins, and
salivary agglutinin31. However, even with these natural barriers to
infection, challenge of animals with a higher dose of ZIKV
directly to the tonsils resulted in productive infection. Investiga-
tors have reported that a bolus challenge of SIV directly to the
oral cavity can infect rhesus macaques, which they considered
might
approximate
HIV
transmission
through
oral-genital
contact32. The finding that an oral bolus of virus may over-
come natural mucosal barriers to infection is especially interesting
because ZIKV has been detected in semen for many months
following acute infection and at viral loads significantly higher
than those detected in blood plasma (8.6 log10 copies per ml)33, 34.
ZIKV RNA and infectious virus have also been detected in breast
milk, another potential route of oral mucosal exposure35. The
potential for transmission of HIV through breast milk is well
documented in humans and is associated with the milk viral
load36, 37. Although there have been no documented cases of
transmission between a nursing mother and her infant, a ZIKV
viral load of greater than 8 × 106 vRNA copies per ml has
been reported in the breast milk in a woman with acute ZIKV
infection18, 20.
Taken together, our results suggest that there is a risk of ZIKV
transmission via the oral mucosal route, as shown by systemic
infection in three of three macaques after application of high-dose
infectious virus to the tonsils. However, the actual risk of trans-
mission via mucosal exposure to saliva may be low—saliva from
donor animals with typical plasma viremia harbored little or no
infectious virus and could not mediate transmission of ZIKV in
our study. However, it must be noted that secretions, including
saliva from individuals with unusually high viral load, semen, and
breast milk, could pose a transmission risk.
Methods
Study design. This study was designed as a proof of concept study to examine
whether ZIKV transmission may occur in the absence of vector-borne or sexual
transmission, via saliva, in the rhesus macaque model. Nothing is currently known
about the potential saliva transmission of ZIKV in vivo so we selected 3 animals for
direct application of ZIKV stock to the palatine tonsils, three animals for sub-
cutaneous inoculation with a well characterized dose of ZIKV21 to serve as saliva
donors, and 7 animals (a minimum of two per donor) to serve as recipients of
saliva from infected donors (Fig. 1). Available animals were allocated to experi-
mental groups based on qualitative assessment of salivation while under ketamine
sedation as communicated by staff at the Wisconsin National Primate Research
Center. Investigators were not blinded to experimental groups.
Ethical approval. This study was approved by the University of Wisconsin-
Madison Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Animal Care and Use
Protocol Number G005401 and V5519).
Nonhuman primates. Six male and seven female Indian-origin rhesus macaques
(Macaca mulatta) utilized in this study were cared for by the staff at the Wisconsin
National Primate Research Center (WNPRC) in accordance with the regulations,
guidelines, and recommendations outlined in the Animal Welfare Act, the Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Weatherall report. In addi-
tion, all macaques utilized in the study were free of Macacineherpesvirus 1, simian
retrovirus type D, simian T-lymphotropic virus type 1, simian immunodeficiency
virus, and had no history of exposure to any dengue virus serotype. Animals ranged
in age from 3 years to 17 years old (mean = 7.8 years). For all procedures, animals
were anesthetized with an intramuscular dose of ketamine (10 ml/kg). Blood
samples were obtained using a vacutainer or needle and syringe from the femoral
or saphenous vein.
Virus. Macaques in this study were inoculated with Asian-lineage Zika virus/H.
sapiens-tc/FRA/2013/FrenchPolynesia-01_v1c1 (ZIKV-FP) obtained from Xavier
de Lamballerie (European Virus Archive, Marseille, France). This virus was ori-
ginally isolated from a 51-year-old female in France after travel to French Polynesia
in 2013 and passaged a single time on Vero cells (African green monkey kidney
cells; CCL-81). This Asian lineage ZIKV isolate shares a recent common ancestor
with strains currently circulating in the Americas and shares 99% nucleotide
identity with them38. In addition, all ZIKV strains associated with epidemic urban,
mosquito-borne transmission, sexual transmission, Guillain–Barré syndrome, and
congenital Zika syndrome include a S139N in the membrane (M) protein, D683E
in the envelope(E) protein, and V763M and T777M in the transmembrane domain
of the E protein39. These changes are shared between the French Polynesian strain
used in this study and the virus isolated from a fatal case of ZIKV described in
Utah21. The Utah ZIKV isolate comes from the first documented non-vector,
non-sexual, non-vertical transmission of ZIKV and shares >99.5% similarity at the
nucleotide level with ZIKV-FP. The virus stock used in this study was prepared by

 Collection (ATCC), were not further authenticated, and were not specifically tested
for mycoplasma. A single, clarified harvest of virus, with a titer of 5.9 × 106 PFU/ml
(3.9 × 109 vRNA copies per ml) ZIKV-FP was used as stock for all subcutaneous
inoculations.
Tonsil challenges. The ZIKV-FP stock was thawed, diluted in PBS to
1 × 106 PFU/ml, and maintained on ice until inoculation. Each animal was anes-
thetized and 8 × 105 PFU ZIKV-FP was applied directly to the palatine tonsils
(maximum of 400 μl per tonsil) via pipet after visualization with a laryngoscope.
Animals were closely monitored by veterinary and animal care staff for adverse
reactions and signs of disease. Animals were examined, and blood, urine, oral
swabs, and saliva were collected from each animal daily from 1 through up to
12 dpi and then weekly thereafter through 28 dpi.
Subcutaneous inoculations. The ZIKV-FP stock was thawed, diluted in PBS to
1 × 104 PFU/ml, and loaded into a 3 ml syringe maintained on ice until inoculation.
For subcutaneous inoculations, each of three Indian-origin rhesus macaques was
anesthetized and inoculated subcutaneously over the cranial dorsum with 1 mL
virus stock containing 1 × 104 PFU. All animals were closely monitored by veter-
inary and animal care staff for adverse reactions and signs of disease. Animals were
examined, and blood, urine, oral swabs, and saliva were collected from each animal
daily from 1 through up to 12 dpi and then weekly thereafter through 28 dpi.
Mucosal membrane challenges. Oral swabs or saliva were collected from sub-
cutaneously inoculated, ZIKV-infected donor macaques for mucosal membrane
challenge of uninfected recipient animals beginning at day three post-infection and
continuing through day 10 (cohorts 1 and 3) or 12 (cohort 2) post-infection of the
donor animals. For recipients challenged with saliva from the first donor, oral
swabs were held under the tongue of the anesthetized donor animal for up to 2 min
to collect saliva. Swabs were then placed in 750 μl of viral transport media (tissue
culture medium 199 supplemented with 0.5% FBS and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic),
swished vigorously for at least 15 s, and then swabs were discarded. Viral transport
media containing saliva was then applied via pipet to the palatine tonsils (100 μl
per tonsil) (after visualization via laryngoscope), conjunctivae (50 μl per eye),
or nasal passages (100 μl per nostril) of the corresponding recipient animal. For
recipients challenged with saliva from the second and third donors, saliva was
collected via pipet from under the tongue of an anesthetized donor animal and
applied directly via pipet to the palatine tonsils (200 μl per tonsil) of each recipient
animal. Mucosal challenges were repeated daily for up to 10 days. Animals were
closely monitored by veterinary and animal care staff for adverse reactions and
signs of disease. As described previously, animals were examined, and blood, urine,
saliva, and oral swabs were collected from each animal daily during challenge and
then weekly thereafter through 28 days after final challenge.
Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Macaque serum samples were
screened for ZIKV neutralizing antibody utilizing a plaque reduction neutralization
test (PRNT) on Vero cells (ATCC #CCL-81). Endpoint titrations of reactive sera,
using a 90% cut off (PRNT90), were performed as described in ref. 40 against
ZIKV-FP. Neutralization curves were generated using GraphPad Prism software.
The resulting data were analyzed by non-linear regression to estimate the dilution
of serum required to inhibit 50% of infection.
Live virus isolation. Mice deficient in the alpha/beta interferon receptor on the
C57BL/6 background (IFNAR−/−) originated from embryos that were provided as
a generous gift from Dr. Eva Harris (University of California, Berkley, CA) and
were bred in the pathogen-free animal facilities of the University of Wisconsin-
Madison School of Veterinary Medicine (Madison, WI). Four groups (n = 12) of
5- to 6-week-old, mixed sex mice were used to test infectivity of ZIKV RNA in
macaque saliva. Mice were inoculated in the left, hind foot pad with 50 μl of saliva
or oral swab eluate in viral transport media (VTM) from samples that tested
positive for ZIKV RNA by qRT-PCR. Mock-infected experimental control mice
received saliva or saliva swab eluate in VTM collected from ZIKV-negative control
macaques. Positive control mice received 104 PFU of the same ZIKV-FP stock that
was used to infect the macaques. Following inoculation, mice were monitored twice
daily for the duration of the study. Sub-mandibular blood draws were performed
and serum was collected to verify viremia via qRT-PCR and nAb titers via PRNT.
Concurrent with mouse infectivity assays, the remainder of the ZIKV RNA-positive
saliva and oral swab samples were also assessed for infectivity by plaque assay on
Vero cells. Duplicate wells were infected with 0.1 ml aliquots from serial 10-fold
dilutions of oral swab eluateor saliva in growth media and allowed to adsorb for
1 h. Following incubation, the inoculum was removed, and monolayers were
overlaid with 3 ml containing a 1:1 mixture of 1.2% oxoid agar and 2 × DMEM
(Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 10% (vol/vol) FBS and 2% (vol/vol) penicillin/
streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 4 days for plaque
development. Cell monolayers then were stained with 3 ml of overlay containing a
1:1 mixture of 1.2% oxoid agar and 2 × DMEM with 2% (vol/vol) FBS, 2% (vol/vol)
penicillin/streptomycin and 0.33% neutral red (Gibco). Cells were incubated
overnight at 37 °C and plaques were counted.
In vitro saliva titration. Fresh saliva collected from uninfected macaques was
tested for its capacity to inhibit the infectivity of ZIKV-FP in Vero cells. ZIKV was
mixed with saliva 1:10 or 1:3 for 1 h at 37 C prior to being added to Vero cells. Final
concentrations were 1 × 102–1 × 105 PFU for the 1:10 dilutions and 8 × 105 PFU for
the 1:3 dilution. Infection was measured by plaque assay as described previously.
Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) spiked with the same concentrations of ZIKV-FP
were used as positive controls.Results from two biological replicates (containing
5 dilutions each) were combined because, based on Student’s t-tests, the variation
within each treatment group was not significantly different between replicates
(t = 0.41, df = 6.5, P = 0.70 for PBS and t = −0.053, df = 7.9, P = 0.96 for saliva).
Plaque forming units were log transformed to meet the assumption of normality
with respect to the explanatory variables prior to analysis.Based on an F-test,
treatment group variance did not differ significantly between groups (F = 1.3,
df = 4, 4, P = 0.81). Treatment groups were compared using a linear regression
model with log PFU as the response variable and treatment group (saliva or PBS),
and dilution as the explanatory variables in R version 3.3.241.
Viral RNA isolation. Plasma was isolated from EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood
collected the same day by Ficoll density centrifugation at 1860 × g for 30 min.
Plasma was removed to a clean 15 ml conical tube and centrifuged at 670 × g for an
additional 8 min to remove residual cells. Urine was opportunistically collected
from a pan beneath each animal’s cage and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to
remove cells and debris. Saliva was collected via pipet from under the tongue or
using sterile oral swabs run under the tongue while animals were anesthetized.
Saliva collected via pipet was used to directly inoculate recipient animals in cohorts
2 and 3. Additional saliva, when available, was removed from the collection pipet,
centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and added to 650 μl viral transport media at a ratio
of no more than one part saliva to three parts viral transport media. Swabs were
placed in viral transport media for 60–90 min, then vortexed vigorously and cen-
trifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to elute saliva. Prior to extraction, oral swab eluates
were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm and 4 °C for an hour. After cen-
trifugation, supernatant was removed, leaving virus in 200 μl media. Viral RNA was
extracted from 300 μl plasma or urine using the Viral Total Nucleic Acid Kit
(Promega, Madison, WI) on a Maxwell 16 MDx instrument (Promega, Madison,
WI). Viral RNA was extracted from 200 μl oral swab-derived samples using the
QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) with all
optional washes. RNA was then quantified using quantitative RT-PCR. The viral
load data from plasma and urine are expressed as vRNA copies/ml. The viral load
data from oral swabs are expressed as vRNA copies/ml eluate. The viral load data
from saliva in viral transport media are expressed as vRNA copies per ml total
volume.
Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). For ZIKV-FP, vRNA from
plasma, urine, saliva, and oral swabs was quantified by qRT-PCR using primers
with a slight modification to those described by Lanciotti et al. to accommodate
African lineage ZIKV sequences42. The modified primer sequences are: forward
5′-CGYTGCCCAACACAAGG-3′, reverse 5′-CACYAAYGTTCTTTTGCABA-
CAT-3′, and probe 5′-6fam-AGCCTACCTTGAYAAGCARTCAGACACYCAA-
BHQ1-3′. The RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript III Platinum
One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) on a Light-
Cycler 480 instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). The primers and
probe were used at final concentrations of 600 and 100 nm, respectively, along with
150 ng random primers (Promega, Madison, WI). Cycling conditions were as
follows: 37 °C for 15 min, 50 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 2 min, followed by
50 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Viral RNA concentration was
determined by interpolation onto an internal standard curve composed of seven
10-fold serial dilutions of a synthetic ZIKV RNA fragment based on ZIKV-FP.
