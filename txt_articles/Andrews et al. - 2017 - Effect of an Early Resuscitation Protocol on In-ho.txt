IMPORTANCE The effect of an early resuscitation protocol on sepsis outcomes in developing
countries remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether an early resuscitation protocol with administration of
intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and blood transfusion decreases mortality among Zambian
adults with sepsis and hypotension compared with usual care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial of 212 adults with sepsis
(suspected infection plus �2 systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria) and
hypotension (systolic blood pressure �90 mm Hg or mean arterial pressure �65 mm Hg)
presenting to the emergency department at a 1500-bed referral hospital in Zambia between
October 22, 2012, and November 11, 2013. Data collection concluded December 9, 2013.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 1:1 to either (1) an early resuscitation protocol for
sepsis (n = 107) that included intravenous fluid bolus administration with monitoring of
jugular venous pressure, respiratory rate, and arterial oxygen saturation and treatment with
vasopressors targeting mean arterial pressure (�65 mm Hg) and blood transfusion
(for patients with a hemoglobin level <7 g/dL) or (2) usual care (n = 105) in which treating
clinicians determined hemodynamic management.
MAINOUTCOMESANDMEASURES Theprimaryoutcomewasin-hospitalmortalityandthesecondary
outcomes included the volume of intravenous fluid received and receipt of vasopressors.
RESULTS Among 212 patients randomized to receive either the sepsis protocol or usual care,
3 were ineligible and the remaining 209 completed the study and were included in the
analysis (mean [SD] age, 36.7 [12.4] years; 117 men [56.0%]; 187 [89.5%] positive for the
human immunodeficiency virus). The primary outcome of in-hospital mortality occurred in 51
of 106 patients (48.1%) in the sepsis protocol group compared with 34 of 103 patients
(33.0%) in the usual care group (between-group difference, 15.1% [95% CI, 2.0%-28.3%];
relative risk, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.04-2.05]; P = .03). In the 6 hours after presentation to the
emergency department, patients in the sepsis protocol group received a median of 3.5 L
(interquartile range, 2.7-4.0 L) of intravenous fluid compared with 2.0 L (interquartile range,
1.0-2.5 L) in the usual care group (mean difference, 1.2 L [95% CI, 1.0-1.5 L]; P < .001). Fifteen
patients (14.2%) in the sepsis protocol group and 2 patients (1.9%) in the usual care group
received vasopressors (between-group difference, 12.3% [95% CI, 5.1%-19.4%]; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with sepsis and hypotension, most of whom
were positive for HIV, in a resource-limited setting, a protocol for early resuscitation with
administration of intravenous fluids and vasopressors increased in-hospital mortality
compared with usual care. Further studies are needed to understand the effects of
administration of intravenous fluid boluses and vasopressors in patients with sepsis across
different low- and middle-income clinical settings and patient populations.

epsis mortality in the developed world steadily de-
clined between 2000 and 2012.1 Part of this improve-
ment has been attributed to the implementation
of sepsis protocols emphasizing early resuscitation with in-
travenous fluid boluses and vasopressors to achieve hemody-
namic targets.2,3
In contrast, mortality from sepsis in low- and middle-
income countries remains high and current usual care fre-
quently does not include early resuscitation with intrave-
nous fluid boluses or vasopressors.4,5 Whether an early
resuscitation protocol could improve sepsis outcomes in
resource-limited settings remains uncertain.
Three studies4-6 compared early resuscitation with usual
care among African patients with severe infection and yielded
conflicting results. A before-after study in Uganda suggested
decreased mortality with a multicomponent intervention in-
cluding intravenous fluid boluses among adults with sepsis.5
A randomized clinical trial (RCT) in Zambia observed no mor-
tality benefit with a protocol of early intravenous fluid and va-
sopressor administration among adults with sepsis; how-
ever, the trial was stopped early for possible harm in the
subgroup of patients with hypoxemia and tachypnea.4 An RCT
conducted among children with severe febrile illness in Kenya,
Uganda, and Tanzania demonstrated increased mortality with
intravenous fluid bolus administration.6
However, each of these studies4-6 had important limita-
tions. In particular, both RCTs4,6 included patients with non-
specific markers of tissue hypoperfusion rather than only pa-
tients with sepsis and overt hypotension, for whom the benefit
of early intravenous fluid bolus and vasopressor administra-
tion may be greatest.
The primary objective of this RCT was to determine
whether a sepsis protocol with early administration of intra-
venous fluid boluses, vasopressors, and blood transfusion
woulddecreasein-hospitalmortalitycomparedwithusualcare
among African adults with sepsis and hypotension.
Methods
The Simplified Severe Sepsis Protocol 2 trial was a parallel-
group, nonblinded RCT conducted at a 1500-bed national re-
ferral university hospital in Zambia.4 The University of Zambia
biomedical research ethics committee and the Vanderbilt Uni-
versity institutional review board granted ethical approval and
thetrialwasoverseenbyanindependentdataandsafetymoni-
toring board. Written informed consent was obtained from pa-
tients or their legally authorized representatives prior to study
enrollment. The trial protocol appears in Supplement 1.
From October 22, 2012, through November 11, 2013, we
screened all patients presenting to the emergency depart-
ment (ED) between 8 AM on Monday and 12 PM on Friday.
Patients aged 18 years or older were eligible if they had (1) sep-
sis (defined as suspected infection plus ≥2 systemic inflam-
matory response syndrome criteria7) and (2) hypotension
(defined as systolic blood pressure ≤90 mm Hg or mean arte-
rial pressure ≤65 mm Hg). Based on the results of a prior trial
inthesamesetting,4weexcludedpatientswithhypoxemiaand
severe tachypnea (defined as arterial oxygen saturation <90%
and respiratory rate >40 breaths per minute). Additional ex-
clusion criteria included gastrointestinal bleeding in the ab-
sence of fever, congestive heart failure exacerbation, end-
stage renal disease, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP),
incarceration, or the need for immediate surgery.2 Enroll-
ment occurred within 4 hours of the first eligible blood pres-
sure measurement and within 24 hours of ED registration.
Study group assignment was generated using computer-
ized randomization in permuted block sizes of 2, 4, and 6.
Allocationslipswereplacedinsealedopaqueenvelopes,which
were opened after informed consent was obtained. Patients,
treating clinicians, and clinical study personnel were aware of
group assignment after enrollment. Study personnel respon-
sible for outcomes assessment and data analysis were blinded
to group assignment.
For patients in both groups, treating clinicians deter-
minedthelocationofcare(intensivecareunitormedicalward)
and antibiotic selection (including use of empirical antituber-
culousandantimalarialtherapy).Inaddition,adedicatedstudy
nurse measured heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation hourly for the 6
hours after enrollment and supervised the administration of
all ordered fluids and medications.
Sepsis Protocol Group
Patients randomized to the sepsis protocol received hemody-
namic management for the first 6 hours after enrollment. An
initial 2-L bolus of intravenous isotonic crystalloid was ad-
ministered within 1 hour of enrollment, followed by an addi-
tional 2 L over the subsequent 4 hours. After each liter of in-
travenous fluid was administered, an investigator or study
nursemeasuredarterialoxygensaturation,respiratoryrate,and
JVP (details appear in the eMethods in Supplement 2). If the
arterialoxygensaturationdecreasedby3%,therespiratoryrate
increased by 5 breaths per minute, or JVP reached 3 cm or
greater above the sternal angle, fluid infusion was discontin-
ued. The sepsis protocol limited intravenous fluid adminis-
tration to a total of 4 L, including any fluid given in the ED prior
to enrollment.
Key Points
Question Does a resuscitation protocol with administration
of intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and blood transfusion
implemented early after presentation to the emergency
department improve in-hospital mortality among Zambian adults
with sepsis and hypotension compared with usual care?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 209 adults
with sepsis and hypotension presenting to an emergency
department in Zambia, a 6-hour sepsis protocol emphasizing
administration of intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and blood
transfusion significantly increased in-hospital mortality compared
with usual care (48.1% vs 33.0%, respectively).
Meaning In resource-limited settings, an early resuscitation
protocol with administration of intravenous fluids, vasopressors,
and blood transfusion for adults with sepsis may increase mortality
compared with usual care.

 If mean arterial pressure remained less than 65 mm Hg af-
ter completion of the initial 2-L fluid bolus, a dopamine infu-
sion (vasopressor) was initiated via a peripheral intravenous
line starting at 10 μg/kg/min and titrated to reach a mean ar-
terial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater. The sepsis protocol rec-
ommended blood transfusion for patients with a hemoglobin
level of less than 7 g/dL or with severe pallor.
Usual Care Group
For patients randomized to usual care, treating clinicians de-
termined intravenous fluid administration, vasopressor use,
and blood transfusion. During usual care for sepsis in the study
setting, the volume of intravenous fluid administered in the
first 6 hours averages less than 2 L, less than half of patients
receive any intravenous fluid bolus, less than 2% of patients
receive a vasopressor, and less than 20% of patients receive a
blood transfusion4 (additional details appear in the eMethods
in Supplement 2).
Data Collection
Because most patients were not ambulatory, we measured
upper arm circumference in lieu of weight to assess nutri-
tional status.8,9 Study personnel recorded the volume of
intravenous fluid administered between ED registration and
6 hours after enrollment, 6 to 24 hours after enrollment, and
24 to 72 hours after enrollment. Patients were followed up
until death or 28 days after enrollment. For patients dis-
charged from the hospital, blinded study personnel called
the patient or next-of-kin to ascertain vital status at 28 days.
Additional details regarding data collection appear in the
eMethods in Supplement 2.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary ef-
ficacy outcomes included 28-day mortality and time to death.
Secondary safety outcomes included the incidence of wors-
ening hypoxemia or tachypnea (decrease in arterial oxygen
saturationof≥3%oranincreaseinrespiratoryrateof≥5breaths
per minute). Process measures included volume of intrave-
nous fluid administered within 6, 24, and 72 hours; reasons
for intravenous fluid discontinuation; and receipt of anti-
biotics, dopamine, and a blood transfusion. Prospectively
collectedadverseeventsincludeddopamineextravasation,tis-
sue ischemia or necrosis, iatrogenic pulmonary edema, and re-
action to blood transfusion.
Statistical Analysis
Based on an in-hospital mortality rate of 65% in a prior trial in
the same setting,4 we calculated that enrolling 212 patients
would provide statistical power of 80% at an α level of .05 to
detect an absolute risk reduction in mortality of 20% (equiva-
lent to a relative risk [RR] reduction of 30.8% and similar to
the RR reduction reported in a prior trial2). One interim analy-
sis was planned, performed, and reviewed by the data and
safety monitoring board after enrollment of 50% of the pa-
tients using a conservative Haybittle-Peto boundary (P < .001)
to allow performance of the final analysis using an un-
changed 2-sided level of significance (P = .05).
All analyses were conducted in a modified intention-to-
treat fashion, analyzing patients by the group to which they
were assigned and excluding those who were recognized as in-
eligible immediately after enrollment and who did not re-
ceivestudyinterventions(Figure1).Continuousvariableswere
reported as mean and standard deviation or median and in-
terquartile range (IQR) and categorical variables as frequen-
cies and proportions. Between-group differences were ana-
lyzed using the t test for parametric continuous variables, the
Mann-Whitney test for nonparametric continuous variables,
the χ2 test for categorical variables, and the log-rank test for
survival analysis.
The primary analysis compared in-hospital mortality be-
tween the sepsis protocol group and the usual care group using
the χ2 test. In secondary analyses, we compared the sepsis pro-
tocol group with the usual care group after adjusting for base-
line Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 (SAPS-3)10 and in pre-
specified subgroups defined by the presence of human
immunodeficiency virus infection, Glasgow Coma Scale score
at presentation, baseline hemoglobin level, baseline lactate
level, baseline SAPS-3, and baseline JVP. Subgroup analyses
used the Mantel-Haenszel test for heterogeneity to assess for
subgroup × study group interaction effects on the risk of in-
hospital mortality. Analyses were performed using Stata ver-
sion 12.1 (StataCorp).
Results
Of 382 patients with sepsis and hypotension, 212 met eligibil-
ity criteria, provided consent to participate, and were ran-
domized. Immediately after randomization, it was recog-
nized that 3 patients should have been excluded (age <18
years, absence of hypotension, and presence of congestive
heart failure), leaving 209 patients who received the study
interventions, completed follow-up, and were included in
the primary analysis (Figure 1). Data collection concluded
December 9, 2013.
Patients assigned to the sepsis protocol (n = 106) and usual
care (n = 103) were similar at baseline (Table 1). Overall, pa-
tients were young (mean age, 36.7 years [SD, 12.4 years]) with
high human immunodeficiency virus prevalence (89.5%)
and low CD4 lymphocyte counts (median, 66/μL [IQR,
21-143/μL] among patients with human immunodeficiency
virus). Median albumin level was 2.2 g/dL (IQR, 1.8-2.7 g/dL)
and most patients were malnourished, with a median upper
arm circumference of 20.1 cm (IQR, 18.4-22.9 cm). Median sys-
tolic blood pressure was 83 mm Hg (IQR, 76-87 mm Hg) with
a median lactate level of 4.3 mmol/L (IQR, 2.8-7.7 mmol/L).
Diagnosis and Treatment of Infection
The most common admitting diagnoses were pneumonia
(49.3%) and suspected tuberculosis (62.7%), with 80 pa-
tients (38.3%) having both. Forty-three patients (20.6%) had
positive tuberculosis blood cultures. Details of admitting di-
agnoses and microbiological data appear in eTables 1 and 2 in
Supplement 2. The median time between ED registration and
the first dose of intravenous antimicrobial therapy was similar

 in the sepsis protocol group and in the usual care group (2.0
vs 1.5 hours, respectively; P = .15).
Hemodynamic Interventions
In the 6 hours after presentation to the emergency depart-
ment, patients in the sepsis protocol group received a median
of3.5L(IQR,2.7-4.0L)ofintravenousfluidcomparedwith2.0L
(IQR, 1.0-2.5 L) in the usual care group (mean difference, 1.2 L
[95%CI,1.0-1.5L];P < .001).Atotalof41patients(38.7%)inthe
sepsisprotocolgroupreceived4Lorgreaterofintravenousfluid
between ED registration and 6 hours after enrollment. Among
the remaining 65 patients (61.3%) in the sepsis protocol group,
intravenous fluids were discontinued prior to a total volume of
4 L due to an increase in respiratory rate or a decrease in arte-
rial oxygen saturation (32 patients [30.2%]), JVP of 3 cm or
greater (9 patients [8.5%]), blood transfusion through an intra-
venous line (5 patients [4.7%]), and other reasons (4 patients
[3.8%]). In the usual care group, only 50 patients (48.3%) re-
ceived any intravenous fluid bolus and the most common fluid
orderwasfortheadministrationof3Lofintravenousfluidover
24 hours (eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
Blood pressure generally increased over the first 6 hours
of treatment in both study groups (Table 2). A total of 15 pa-
tients (14.2%) received a dopamine infusion (vasopressor) in
the 6 hours after enrollment in the sepsis protocol group com-
pared with 2 patients (1.9%) in the usual care group (between-
group difference, 12.3% [95% CI, 5.1% to 19.4%]; P < .001). The
decrease in lactic acid concentration from baseline to 6 hours
was greater in the sepsis protocol group (median, −1.2 mmol/L;
IQR, −3.4 to 0.3 mmol/L) than in the usual care group (median,
−0.5 mmol/L; IQR, 2.2 to 1.1 mmol/L) (mean difference,
1.45 mmol/L [95% CI, 0.4 to 2.5 mmol/L]; P = .02).
Due to limited intensive care unit capacity, 208 of the 209
patients (99.5%) were cared for on regular medical wards with-
out the availability of mechanical ventilation. More patients
inthesepsisprotocolgroup(35.8%)thanintheusualcaregroup
(22.3%) experienced a decrease in oxygen saturation of 3% or
greater or an increase in respiratory rate of 5 breaths or more

25.7%]; P = .03) (Table 2).
Clinical Outcomes
The primary outcome of in-hospital mortality occurred in 51
of 106 patients (48.1%) in the sepsis protocol group vs 34 of
103 patients (33.0%) in the usual care group (between-group
difference,15.1%[95%CI,2.0%-28.3%];RR,1.46[95%CI,1.04-
2.05]; P = .03). Vital status after hospital discharge at day 28
was known for 97 patients in each study group; 28-day mor-
tality was 67.0% with the sepsis protocol vs 45.3% with usual
care (between-group difference, 21.6% [95% CI, 8.0%-
35.3%]; RR, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.14-1.91]; P = .002). In the multi-
variable analysis adjusting for SAPS-3 at enrollment, risk of in-
hospital mortality (RR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.04-2.02]; P = .03) and
28-day mortality (RR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.08-1.84]; P = .01) was
greaterinthesepsisprotocolgroupthanintheusualcaregroup.
In the time-to-event analysis, the probability of survival was
lower in the sepsis protocol group than in the usual care group
(P = .02) (Figure 2 and eTable 4 in Supplement 2). Increased
in-hospitalmortalityamongpatientsassignedtothesepsispro-
tocol was consistent across prespecified patient subgroups
(Figure 3). Median hospital length of stay was 5 days (IQR, 3-8
days) in the sepsis protocol group vs 7 days (IQR, 4-12 days) in
the usual care group (P = .01). Rates of adverse events were
similar between groups (eTable 5 in Supplement 2).
Discussion
This RCT among Zambian adults with sepsis and hypoten-
sion, most of whom had been diagnosed with HIV, found that
a protocol for early resuscitation with intravenous fluid bo-
luses and vasopressors increased mortality compared with
usual care. The sepsis protocol resulted in greater intrave-
nous fluid administration, vasopressor use, and lactate clear-
ance but caused more frequent worsening of hypoxemia and
tachypnea and higher rates of in-hospital and 28-day mortal-
ity. These findings may have important implications for
the clinical care of patients with sepsis in low- and middle-
income countries and for future research in early sepsis man-
agement across settings.

 Despiteinternationalrecommendationsforfluidbolusand
vasopressor administration in the treatment of sepsis-
induced hypotension,11 supportive data are scarce. The Early
Goal-DirectedTherapy(EGDT)trial,2whichinvolved263adults
with sepsis at a single ED in the United States, reported re-
duced mortality with administration of intravenous fluid bo-
luses per protocol to achieve central venous pressure of
8 mm Hg to 12 mm Hg, vasopressors to achieve mean arterial
pressure of 65 mm Hg to 90 mm Hg, and blood transfusion or
administration of inotropes to achieve central venous oxy-
gen saturation of 70% or greater.
Three recent multicenter trials12-14 found no difference be-
tween EGDT and usual care, but may have achieved smaller
between-group differences in fluid administration due to in-
corporation of early fluid administration into usual sepsis care
in resource-intense settings.3,11,15 In contrast, the current study
is the third RCT to suggest that early resuscitation for African
patients with infection and hypoperfusion may increase mor-
tality compared with usual care.4,6
Several potential explanations exist for the discordance in
findings between the EGDT trial and the more recent African
trials. Similar to the Fluid Expansion As Supportive Therapy
(FEAST) trial6 and the prior Simplified Severe Sepsis Protocol
trial,4patientsinthecurrentstudywerepredominantlyyoung,
malnourished individuals at risk for tuberculosis and ma-
laria. In this patient population, rapid administration of intra-
venous fluid boluses may predispose to pulmonary edema and
respiratory failure, conferring high mortality in the absence of
ventilator support.4
Despite excluding 20% of otherwise eligible patients for
hypoxemia and severe tachypnea, nearly one-third of pa-
tients in the sepsis protocol group required discontinuation of
intravenous fluids due to decreased oxygen saturation or in-
creased respiratory rate. Nearly all patients in the current trial
were cared for on the medical ward without access to me-
chanical ventilation compared with the 30% to 70% of pa-
tients who received mechanical ventilation in the EGDT trials,
which were performed in high-income countries.2,12-14
Resource limitations mandated that the resuscitation tar-
gets in the sepsis protocol in the current trial differ from the

 EGDT algorithm.2 In the absence of access to central venous
catheterization, the protocol in the current study prescribed
an initial 2-L intravenous fluid bolus during the first hour and
used JVP measurement and respiratory examination to deter-
mine when fluid administration should be discontinued. It is
possible that JVP did not serve as a reliable surrogate mea-
sure of central venous pressure16 or that central venous pres-
sure itself was an inaccurate indicator of developing volume
overload.17Thefactthatmorethan30%ofpatientstreatedwith
the sepsis protocol developed worsening respiratory func-
tion but less than 10% developed JVP elevation suggests that
JVP cannot be safely used as an end point for fluid adminis-
tration in this context.
A before-after study in Uganda5 reported the safety and
efficacy of fluid boluses guided by blood pressure measure-
ment rather than JVP, but the before-after design and the pres-
ence of a dedicated medical officer for the intervention group
make comparison with the current study challenging. The only
vasopressor available in the setting of the current study was
dopamine. Recent studies have demonstrated better clinical
outcomes with norepinephrine than with dopamine18-20 and
increaseddopamineadministrationinthesepsisprotocolgroup
may have contributed to increased mortality.
This study has several important strengths. The design in-
cluded randomization to balance baseline confounders, con-
cealed allocation to prevent selection bias, monitoring by an
independent data and safety monitoring board, and collec-
tion of clinical outcomes by blinded study personnel. Unlike
recenttrialsinhigh-incomecountries,12-14usualcareinthecur-
rent study setting involved limited early fluid or vasopressor
administration. As a result, the differences in the volume of
intravenous fluid received and receipt of vasopressors be-
tween patients in the sepsis protocol group and the usual care
group were greater than in any prior sepsis resuscitation
trial,2,12-14strengtheningcausalinferencesbetweenstudygroup
and clinical outcomes.
Limitations
Thisstudyalsohasseverallimitations.First,moderatesizeand
conduct at a single center may exaggerate the observed treat-
menteffect.However,anybaselineimbalancesbetweengroups
that occurred despite randomization appeared to be rela-
tivelysmall(eg,between-groupdifferenceinbaselinelacticacid
concentration of 0.7 mmol/L), and likely do not explain the
between-group differences in clinical outcomes. Second, al-
though study enrollment occurred shortly after arrival in the
ED, the onset of infection for many patients may have oc-
curreddaystoweeksbeforepresentation.Third,patients,treat-
ing clinicians, and clinical study personnel were not blinded
to group assignment. Fourth, the sepsis protocol relied on de-
termination of JVP, a semireproducible skill, and data were not
collected on the concordance of JVP measurement between
study personnel. Fifth, secondary multivariable analyses re-
lied on the SAPS-3, which has not been validated as a marker

 for severity of illness in the study setting.10 Sixth, only 1 of 209
patients was cared for in an intensive care unit. Although this
reflects the reality of medical care in most hospitals in sub-
Saharan Africa, it limits the generalizability to more resource-
intense settings.
Coupled with the results of the FEAST trial6 and the prior
Simplified Severe Sepsis Protocol trial,4 the findings of the cur-
rent study suggest that in settings without routine access to
mechanical ventilation, the risks of intravenous fluid bolus ad-
ministration for patients acutely ill from infection may out-
weigh the benefits. These findings also increase the uncer-
tainty regarding the ideal approach to intravenous fluid
administration during early sepsis management in high-
income settings. Further trials carefully examining the hemo-
dynamic, cellular, and clinical effects of intravenous fluid bo-
lus and vasopressor administration in sepsis are needed.
Conclusions
Among adults with sepsis and hypotension, most of whom
were positive for HIV, in a resource-limited setting, a protocol
for early resuscitation with administration of intravenous flu-
ids and vasopressors increased in-hospital mortality com-
pared with usual care. Further studies are needed to under-
stand the effects of administration of intravenous fluid boluses
and vasopressors in patients with sepsis across different low-
and middle-income clinical settings and patient populations.
