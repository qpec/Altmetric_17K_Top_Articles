Abstract
Background & Aims—Uncontrolled studies show sitagliptin, an oral DPP-4 inhibitor, may 
improve alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and liver histology in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 
(NAFLD) patients. We aimed to compare sitagliptin versus placebo's efficacy in reducing liver fat 
measured by MRI-derived proton density-fat fraction (MRI-PDFF).
Methods—This randomized, double-blind, allocation-concealed, placebo-controlled trial 
included 50 NAFLD patients with pre-diabetes or early diabetes randomized to sitagliptin orally 
100 mg/day or placebo for 24 weeks. Primary outcome was liver fat change measured by MRI-
PDFF in co-localized regions of interest within each of nine liver segments. Additional advanced 
assessments included MR spectroscopy (MRS) for internal validation of MRI-PDFF's accuracy, 
and MR elastography (MRE) and FIBROSpect® II to assess liver fibrosis.
Results—Sitagliptin was not significantly better than placebo in reducing liver fat measured by 
MRI-PDFF (mean difference between sitagliptin and placebo arms: −1.3%, p=0.4). Compared to 
baseline, there were no significant differences in end-of-treatment MRI-PDFF for sitagliptin 
(18.1% to 16.9%, p=0.27) or placebo (16.6% to 14.0%, p=0.07). The groups had no significant 
differences for changes in ALT, aspartate aminotransferase, low-density lipoprotein, homeostatic 
model assessment insulin resistance, and MRE-derived liver stiffness. In both groups at baseline 
and post-treatment, MRI-PDFF and MRS showed robust correlation coefficients ranging from 
r2=0.96 to r2=0.99 (p<0.0001), demonstrating the findings’ strong internal validity. FIBROSpect® 
II showed no changes in the sitagliptin group but was significantly increased in the placebo group 
(p=0.03).
Conclusions—Sitagliptin was safe but not better than placebo in reducing liver fat in prediabetic 
or diabetic patients with NAFLD.

INTRODUCTION
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in the 
United States and the Western World.1-4 NAFLD is commonly associated with metabolic 
syndrome features, including obesity, dyslipidemia, and diabetes.5-7 The presence of pre-
diabetes and diabetes is associated with the progressive form of NAFLD also termed as 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).8, 9 Several anti-diabetic therapies have been 
investigated in the treatment of NASH with varying success, including metformin,10-12 
rosiglitazone,13, 14 pioglitazone,15-17 and liraglutide.18

 Sitagliptin is an oral antihyperglycemic agent that competitively inhibits the enzyme 
dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), which inactivates the hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 
(GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) released in response to 
meals. By blocking GLP-1 and GIP breakdown, sitagliptin increases insulin secretion and 
suppresses glucagon release in the pancreas,19 which lowers blood glucose levels and 
improves hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Improvement in hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia 
results in the downregulation of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) 
and the blockage of fatty acid synthase,20 which should lead to improvement in liver fat and 
NASH. This provides mechanistic justification to conduct human trials with sitagliptin in 
NAFLD patients.
In clinical trials conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), sitagliptin has 
been shown to be effective in improving glycemic control, cholesterol, and lipoproteins 21-23 
compared to placebo. Recent studies have shown that sitagliptin may improve serum alanine 
(ALT) and aspartate (AST) aminotransferase levels and gamma- glutamyl transpeptidase 
(GGT) in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.24 In another uncontrolled pilot study, 
sitagliptin was shown to improve features of liver histology in 15 patients with type 2 
diabetes over a 48 week period.25 However, human trials on sitagliptin have been limited to 
date because of lack of placebo-arm and allocation-concealment.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of sitagliptin versus placebo in high risk 
patients with well-characterized, imaging quantified, NAFLD in reducing liver fat as 
measured by an accurate and well-validated, robust, quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) 
imaging (MRI)-based biomarker: proton density-fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). Additionally, we 
evaluated the efficacy of sitagliptin versus placebo in reducing liver fibrosis over a 24-week 
period using both advanced MR elastography (MRE) techniques and biomarker-based 
FIBROSpect® II testing. MRE has been shown to be effective in the noninvasive 
measurement of hepatic stiffness as a surrogate for hepatic fibrosis in NAFLD patients. 26-31 
FIBROSpect® II has also been shown to be a highly accurate, noninvasive test to diagnose 
hepatic fibrosis.32, 33
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patient Population
We conducted an investigator-initiated, randomized, double-blind, allocation-concealed, 
placebo-controlled clinical trial to examine the efficacy of sitagliptin at 100 mg/day orally 
versus identical placebo given over 24 weeks to improve hepatic steatosis as measured by 
MRI-PDFF, a validated, accurate, and quantitative biomarker for hepatic steatosis. The trial 
was conducted in strict accordance with CONSORT guidelines (see supplementary materials 
for CONSORT checklist). The patient population for the trial was derived from the San 
Diego Integrated NAFLD Research Consortium – a city-wide network established by the 
principal investigator (RL) that includes four sites: UCSD Medical Center, Balboa Naval 
Medical Center, Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, and Sharp Health System. Patients 
deemed eligible were referred to the UCSD NAFLD Research Center 28, 34-38 for screening 
into the trial. The trial was conducted at the UCSD Clinical and Translational Research 
Institute and all imaging was performed at the UCSD Liver Imaging Group MRI laboratory.

 FIBROSpect® II testing was performed by PROMETHEUS® Therapeutics & Diagnostics 
(San Diego, USA). The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (registration number: 
NCT01963845) and the trial protocol received FDA approval under an Investigational New 
Drug application held by RL. This clinical trial protocol was approved by the human 
subjects Institutional Review Board at UCSD, and all patients provided a written informed 
consent at the initial visit.
Inclusion Criteria
Patients were included if they were ≥18 years of age, had ALT above upper limits of normal 
(19 U/L for women, 30 U/L for men), had documented hepatic steatosis (≥5% on MRI-
PDFF), were either pre-diabetic or controlled diabetic patients (HbA1c 5.7% – 8.0%), and 
provided written informed consent.
Exclusion Criteria
Patients were excluded if they met any of the following exclusion criteria: uncontrolled 
diabetes (HbA1c >8.0), alcohol intake >30 grams/day (3 drinks per day) within the previous 
10 years or >10 grams/day within the previous year; evidence of other forms of liver disease, 
including hepatitis B (positive serum hepatitis B surface antigen), hepatitis C (positive 
hepatitis C viral RNA), autoimmune hepatitis (positive autoimmune serology and consistent 
biopsy), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (low alpha-1 antitrypsin levels and consistent 
biopsy), hemochromatosis (homozygosity or heterozygosity on genetic analysis and 3+ or 
4+ iron staining on biopsy), Wilson's disease (ceruloplasmin with consistent biopsy), drug-
induced liver disease based on exposure and history, and biliary duct obstruction based on 
imaging studies; evidence of decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh score >7 points); 
advanced liver disease (platelet count <75,000 mm2, prothrombin time >16 seconds, or a 
history of bleeding disorders); history of gastrointestinal bypass or use of drugs known to 
cause hepatic steatosis; recent initiation or change of anti-diabetic drugs, including insulin, 
sulfonylureas, or thiazolidinediones, or recent initiation of sitagliptin (or other drugs in the 
same class), within 90 days of randomization; history of acute pancreatitis within 5 years 
(except gallstone pancreatitis); evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma; positive human 
immunodeficiency virus test; active substance abuse; pregnant or trying to become pregnant; 
renal insufficiency; significant systemic illnesses; contraindications to sitagliptin use; and 
inability to undergo MRI.
Baseline Assessment at Screening
All patients underwent a baseline assessment before randomization, including detailed 
medical history and physical exam (see supplementary material for details).
Randomization and Allocation Concealment
The UCSD Investigational Drug Services randomized the patients into either sitagliptin or 
placebo groups in blocks of four in a 1:1 ratio using computer-generated numbers. Blinding 
and allocation concealment was rigorously maintained by independent pharmacists at the 
UCSD Investigational Drug Services who dispensed active or placebo treatment pills that 
were identical in appearance to one another. The pills were prepackaged in identical bottles

 and also labeled based on the computer-generated randomization numbers. The allocation 
sequence remained concealed throughout the trial from all study investigators. Un-blinding 
of treatment allocation was done only after all study procedures were completed in all study 
patients. The trial dataset was locked and directly analyzed by the study statistician using 
pre-specified data analysis plan.
Study Visits
After careful assessment at the baseline visit, patients meeting all inclusion and exclusion 
criteria were randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg orally daily or placebo for 24 weeks. 
Patients returned to the research clinic for follow-up visits at weeks 4, 12, and 24 (see 
supplementary material for details).
Primary and Secondary Outcomes
The primary outcome was change in liver fat quantified by MRI-PDFF in co-localized 
regions of interest (ROI) within each of the nine liver segments. The secondary outcomes 
were insulin sensitivity improvement as determined by HOMA-IR, change in serum AST 
and ALT values, and change in LDL. Changes in liver stiffness as quantified by MRE and 
FIBROSpect® II were exploratory end-points.
MRI and MRE Protocols
MRI-PDFF for Fat Quantification—MRI-PDFF is a non-invasive, objective, and 
quantitative MR imaging-based biomarker that can accurately estimate liver fat content.39, 40 
PDFF measurements are independent of confounders that frequently confound fat 
quantification via conventional MRI techniques, including scanner manufacturer, scanner 
platform, and field strength.41, 42 Previously, we have shown the utility of MRI-PDFF for 
assessing treatment response in NASH trials.34, 37 In this study, the mean (±SD) time 
interval from obtaining the baseline MRI-PDFF to initiating the study drug/placebo was 27.7 
(±82.1) days.
MRI-PDFF for Detailed Fat Mapping of the Entire Liver—All MR examinations 
were done by experienced research MR technologists in the UCSD Liver Imaging Group 
MRI Laboratory under the direction of the radiology investigator (CS). A trained image 
analyst blinded to the patients’ treatment group allocation, clinical and biochemical data, 
and order of scans (baseline and follow-up), performed the images analyses (see 
supplementary material for details).
ROI Colocalization Before and After Treatment—Colocalized ROIs were used to 
assess longitudinal fat changes over time. One colocalized ROI was placed in each of the 
nine liver segments, which were represented by nine different ROIs, on the MR exams at 
baseline and follow-up.
Internal Validation of MRI-PDFF using MR Spectroscopy (MRS)—MRI-PDFF and 
MRS were performed for each patient in a single location (voxel) in the right hepatic 
lobe.41, 43 The PDFF measured by MRS served as the reference for MRI-PDFF, thus 
allowing for internal validation of the accuracy of MRI-PDFF measurements. To ensure the

 colocalization of MRI-PDFF with the MRS voxel, three ROIs were placed on the MRI-
PDFF maps through the top, middle, and bottle thirds of the voxel and the averages of the 
three MRI-PDFF estimates were obtained.
MR Elastography—MRE has been shown to be a robust, accurate biomarker for the 
quantitative, noninvasive evaluation of liver stiffness as a surrogate for liver 
fibrosis26, 27, 44, 45 and may also be helpful for the early NASH detection.46 MRE 
acquisitions was obtained using previously published parameters.27, 46 A direct inversion 
algorithm was used to convert the collected data into images (called elastograms) showing 
the shear stiffness of the liver at different locations (see supplementary material for details).
Colocalization for Assessing Longitudinal MRE Changes—During baseline and 
follow-up MRE exams, multi-slice, colocalized ROIs were manually specified in order to 
assess for longitudinal changes in the mechanical properties of liver stiffness and fibrosis. 
For all ROIs, only liver parenchyma was included, and the excluded regions were (1) regions 
where the magnitude or shear wave amplitude were inadequate and (2) the five top and 
bottom slices to avoid boundary effect.
FIBROSpect® II—FIBROSpect® II (PROMETHEUS® Therapeutics & Diagnostics, San 
Diego, United States) was used to assess changes in hepatic fibrosis in the sitagliptin and 
placebo groups at weeks 0 and 24. The FIBROSpect® II score utilizes a proprietary 
algorithm calculated using the biomarkers alpha-2 macroglobulin, hyaluronic acid, and 
tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase I (TIMP1), which were measured from blood samples 
collected at weeks 0 and 24. The FIBROSpect® II score then estimates the patients’ risk of 
having fibrosis.
Statistical Analysis—The SAS statistical software package, version 9.4 (SAS, Cary, 
United States), was used to perform all statistical analyses in this study. To compare between 
the sitagliptin and placebo groups, the Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test were used for 
categorical variables, and the independent samples t-test or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test 
were used for the differences between continuous variables. An intention-to-treat analysis 
was performed as the primary analysis. Additional analyses of primary and secondary 
outcomes within treatment groups were performed by using two-tailed independent sample 
t-tests, paired t-tests, or non-parametric tests, when indicated. The associations between 
variables in different groups were evaluated using Spearman rank correlations (rs). Given the 
skewed distribution of ALT, AST, and GGT, we used the natural logarithm of each of the 
three variables in separate multiple linear regression models to compare the slopes of each 
variables in the sitagliptin and placebo groups. A two-tailed significance level p≤0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. All study authors had access to study data and approved 
the final data analysis and submission.
A priori, we expected that a 5% (net effect) difference between the sitagliptin and placebo 
arms would be the minimally appreciable and clinically relevant difference between the two 
groups. Based on the results of our previous clinical trial involving colesevelam,34 we 
expected the sitagliptin group to have a liver fat reduction of ≥6% compared to baseline, the 
placebo group to have <1% reduction in liver fat compared to baseline, and a dropout rate of

 <10%.34 We needed ≥19 patients in each arm to achieve a power of at least 80% with a β of 
0.05. Therefore, we planned to enroll 50 patients in the study and randomize at least 44 of 
them to the sitagliptin or placebo groups to ensure study adequate study power even with 
dropouts.
Additionally, Power analysis indicated an 84.5% chance of detecting a difference of 12 U/L 
ALT between the groups as significant (two-tailed alpha=0.05). This assumed a total of 22 
patients in each group, allowing a 10% sample size reduction to adjust for the skewed 
distribution of ALT.
RESULTS
From January 2014 to March 2015, 50 NAFLD patients were randomized to receive 
sitagliptin 100 mg/day orally or placebo. 84 total patients were screened for the study, (see 
Supplementary Figure 1 for the derivation of cohort). In the sitagliptin arm, all 25 patients 
completed the study. In the placebo arm, 22 out of 25 patients completed the study, with two 
patients lost to follow-up and one patient discontinuing due to work schedule. 58% of the 
study population were women, 32% were non-Hispanic whites, and 36% were Hispanic. The 
two groups had similar baseline characteristics (Table 1).
Primary Outcome: Effect of Sitagliptin on Liver Fat Assessed using MRI-PDFF
Liver fat, as measured by MRI-PDFF, was not significantly reduced in the sitagliptin group 
compared to the placebo group. The mean difference in liver fat change between the 
sitagliptin and placebo groups was −1.3%, p=0.4096 (Table 2A). The percent change 
between baseline and end-of-treatment MRI-PDFF between the two groups are shown in 
Figure 1. Compared to baseline, there was no significant difference in end-of-treatment 
MRI-PDFF in the sitagliptin group (18.1% to 16.9%, p=0.2673) or the placebo group 
(16.6% to 14.0%, p=0.0729) (Table 2A). Figure 2 shows MRI-PDFF fat mapping from all 
nine liver segments before and after treatment in one representative patient.
MRS, used as a reference standard to quantify liver fat, was performed in co-localized ROIs 
with MRI-PDFF to demonstrate the internal validity of MRI-PDFF measurements. MRI-
PDFF and MRS measurements correlated well with one another in both groups at baseline 
and post-treatment, and the correlation coefficients ranged from rs=0.96 to rs=0.99 
(p<0.0001).
Effect of Sitagliptin on Hepatic Fibrosis as Assessed by MRE
All 25 patients in the sitagliptin group and 22 patients in the placebo group had MRE at 60 
Hz at baseline and end-of-treatment. The mean difference in MRE stiffness between the 
sitagliptin and placebo groups was −0.2, p=0.2631. Compared to baseline, there was no 
significant difference in end-of-treatment MRE in the sitagliptin group (2.6 to 2.7, 
p=0.3542) or the placebo group (2.8 to 2.7, p=0.5378) (Table 3). Figure 3 shows MRE 
elastograms depicting liver stiffness before and after treatment in one representative patient.

 Effect of Sitagliptin on AST, ALT, LDL, and HOMA-IR
There were no significant changes in AST, ALT, LDL, and HOMA-IR between the 
sitagliptin and placebo groups. Changes in biochemical and anthropometric variables 
between the sitagliptin and placebo groups are summarized in Table 4. Using natural 
logarithm of AST, ALT, and GGT in separate multiple linear regression models to compare 
the slopes of changes between the two groups, there were no significant differences in the 
slopes of sitagliptin versus placebo in any of the models (Supplementary Table 1). There was 
a significant decrease in glucose within the sitagliptin group (104.0 to 99.0, p=0.0352), 
although no significant glucose reduction was found between the sitagliptin and control 
groups (p=0.3852).
Effect of Sitagliptin on Hepatic Fibrosis as Assessed by FIBROSpect® II
There was no significant difference between fibrosis changes in the sitagliptin group versus 
changes in fibrosis in the placebo group, as assessed by FIBROSpect® II (p=0.3057, Table 
5). In the sitagliptin group, there were no significant changes in FIBROSpect® II, alpha-2 
macroglobulin, hyaluronic acid, and TIMP1. In the control group, there was a significant 
increase in FIBROSpect® II (p=0.0306) and hyaluronic acid (p=0.0125) from baseline to 
end-of-treatment.
Adverse events
There were no significant adverse events documented as part of this study. No patient in the 
sitagliptin arm dropped out of the study, and three patients in the placebo arm dropped out of 
the study. The dropouts from the placebo arm were not associated with any study adverse 
events.
DISCUSSION
Main findings
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial showed sitagliptin was not 
significantly better than placebo for reducing liver fat as measured by MRI-PDFF. 
Sitagliptin was also not significantly better than placebo for improving the secondary 
endpoints of AST, ALT, LDL, and HOMA-IR. Sitagliptin did not significantly decrease 
fibrosis as measured by MRE, although patients in the placebo group showed an increase in 
fibrosis as estimated by FIBROSpect® II and hyaluronic acid.
This trial provides new data as proof of concept to conduct clinical trials in higher risk 
patients such as pre-diabetics and diabetics without the need to do a liver biopsy in order to 
efficiently screen agents that have a role in the treatment of NASH in early phase trials. Our 
previous trials included a liver biopsy, but this trial protocol was approved by the United 
States Federal Drug Administration without the need for baseline liver biopsy as the patient 
population was considered likely to have NASH on biopsy. It provides independent 
validation of the methodology used in the MOZART Trial37 to give further evidence that 
measurements of hepatic fat fraction using MRI-PDFF is accurate and may be used to 
longitudinally measure hepatic fat changes over time. All MRI-PDFF measurements were 
confirmed by co-localized MRS measurements. This trial also provides validation of the

 methodology used for co-localization of MRE before and after to examine changes in liver 
stiffness in a clinical trial involving patients with NAFLD. This trial shows that 
FIBROSpect® II may have utility in monitoring longitudinal changes in fibrosis in future 
NASH clinical trials. Finally, this trial provides convincing evidence that sitagliptin-treated 
patients can be included in future NASH trials as it is not likely to modify NASH treatment.
Rationale for using MRI-PDFF for assessing liver fat
MRI-PDFF was used to assess the primary outcome of liver fat change because it is non-
invasive and does not subject patients to ionizing radiation like computed tomography (CT) 
scans. Additionally, it allows for objective, quantitative fat fraction measurements 
throughout different segments of the liver with minimal sampling variability.43 In previous 
NAFLD clinical trials, MRI-PDFF was shown to be more sensitive than histology for 
assessing quantitative changes in liver fat.34, 39 Compared to ultrasound, MRI-PDFF is not 
operator-dependent and provides more objective measures. MRI-PDFF is also more accurate 
than CT without subjecting patients to ionizing radiation. MRI-PDFF is also much more 
practical to perform than MRS, which can only be performed at specialized centers, is 
difficult to perform and analyze from a technical standpoint, and can only be used to 
estimate liver fat content within a 2×2×2 cm3 cube (voxel) in the liver.34
Strengths and limitations
The strength of this study lies in its use of a randomized, double-blind, allocation-concealed, 
placebo-controlled clinical trial study design to evaluate the effectiveness of sitagliptin 
versus placebo for treating NAFLD. MRI-PDFF, a novel, precise, and accurate noninvasive 
imaging biomarker, was used to evaluate the primary outcome of changes in liver fat. The 
study was conducted by experienced investigators from multidisciplinary backgrounds and 
with special expertise in the noninvasive assessment of NAFLD. Our study protocol for 
measuring quantitative changes in liver fat within ROIs in each of the nine liver segments 
can be utilized in future NASH clinical trials. We demonstrate the utility of advanced MR 
methods, including MRE, for measuring longitudinal changes in liver stiffness in clinical 
trials. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the non-invasive, biomarker-based test 
FIBROSpect® II in monitoring longitudinal changes in hepatic fibrosis in NASH clinical 
trials.
However, we acknowledge the following limitations. The study was performed at a center 
which is highly specialized for advanced imaging in NASH. While MRI-PDFF has been 
shown to be effective for measuring changes in hepatic steatosis in our research center, 
additional multi-center trials are needed to assess the utility of MRI-PDFF for measuring 
hepatic steatosis changes in more diverse patient populations. MRI-PDFF changes only 
provide information regarding changes in liver fat, and does not provide any information 
regarding improvement in liver inflammation, cellular injury, and fibrosis. Therefore, 
additional non-invasive biomarkers of inflammation, cellular injury, and fibrosis are needed 
to ascertain a more comprehensive assessment of treatment response. Although we found 
little change in hepatic stiffness from the beginning to end-of-treatment, longer studies may 
be needed to assess the utility of MRE for measuring longitudinal changes in hepatic 
stiffness. Finally, hepatic inflammation plays an important role in morbidity and mortality in 
Cui et al.

 NAFLD patients, and further studies are needed to develop novel biomarkers to assess 
changes in necroinflammation activity, ballooning degeneration, and fibrogenesis, since 
MRI-PDFF, MRE and FIBROSpect® II cannot detect these changes.
Implications for future research
This study shows that sitagliptin at 100 mg/day for six months has little effect in treating 
NAFLD compared to placebo. This study suggests that MRI-PDFF, MRE, and 
FIBROSpect® II may have utility as non-invasive biomarkers to assess treatment response in 
NASH clinical trials, although further studies are needed to validate the use of MRI-PDFF 
and MRE. Further studies are also needed to assess the utility of MRI-PDFF, MRE, and 
FIBROSpect® II for measuring hepatic fat and fibrosis in multicenter clinical trials and also 
in clinical trials of longer duration.

 Lay Summary
In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the anti-diabetic drug sitagliptin 
was no more effective than placebo for improving liver fat and liver fibrosis in patients 
with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study demonstrates that noninvasive 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging techniques, including MRI-proton density 
fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), can be used to 
assess treatment response in NAFLD clinical trials.

Percentage change in liver fat relative to baseline as assessed by MRI-PDFF and stratified by 
treatment group. The sitagliptin group is on the left in red and the placebo group is on the 
right in blue. There was no significant difference in the change in liver fat between the two 
groups (p=0.585).

upper panels show MRI-PDFF measurements in the superior liver (regions 1, 2, 4a, 7, and 8) 
and the lower panels show MRI-PDFF in the inferior liver (regions 3, 4b, 5, and 6). The left 
column shows MRI-PDFF values at week 0 and the right column shows MRI-PDFF values 
at week 24. The patient's calculated liver fat fraction (averaged from the nine liver segments) 
decreased from 55.3% (Week 0) to 38.1% (Week 24).
