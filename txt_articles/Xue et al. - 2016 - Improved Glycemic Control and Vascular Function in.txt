Improved Glycemic Control and
Vascular Function in Overweight and
Obese Subjects by Glyoxalase 1
Inducer Formulation
Diabetes 2016;65:2282–2294 | DOI: 10.2337/db16-0153
Risk of insulin resistance, impaired glycemic control, and
cardiovascular disease is excessive in overweight and obese
populations. We hypothesized that increasing expression
of glyoxalase 1 (Glo1)—an enzyme that catalyzes the
metabolism of reactive metabolite and glycating agent
methylglyoxal—may improve metabolic and vascular
health. Dietary bioactive compounds were screened for
Glo1 inducer activity in a functional reporter assay, hits
were confirmed in cell culture, and an optimized Glo1
inducer formulation was evaluated in a randomized,
placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial in 29 overweight
and obese subjects. We found trans-resveratrol (tRES) and
hesperetin (HESP), at concentrations achieved clinically,
synergized to increase Glo1 expression. In highly overweight
subjects (BMI >27.5 kg/m2), tRES-HESP coformulation in-
creased expression and activity of Glo1 (27%, P < 0.05)
and decreased plasma methylglyoxal (237%, P < 0.05) and
total body methylglyoxal-protein glycation (214%, P < 0.01).
It decreased fasting and postprandial plasma glucose (25%,
P < 0.01, and 28%, P < 0.03, respectively), increased oral
glucose insulin sensitivity index (42 mL $ min21 $ m22, P <
0.02), and improved arterial dilatation Dbrachial artery flow-
mediated dilatation/Ddilation response to glyceryl nitrate
(95% CI 0.13–2.11). In all subjects, it decreased vascular in-
flammation marker soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1
(210%, P < 0.01). In previous clinical evaluations, tRES and
HESP individually were ineffective. tRES-HESP coformula-
tion could be a suitable treatment for improved metabolic
and vascular health in overweight and obese populations.
Increasing overweight and obese populations are driving a
global epidemic of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease
in Westernized countries. Glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) was linked to
clinical obesity through association with measures of fat
deposition and Glo1 deficiency identified as a driver of
cardiovascular disease in a large integrative genomics study
(1,2). It is currently unaddressed by therapeutic agents.
Experimental studies found that overexpression of Glo1
in mice suppressed inflammation and body weight gain
in overfeeding models of obesity and prevented vascular
disease in diabetes (3).
Glo1 is part of the glyoxalase metabolic pathway, which
consists of two enzymes, Glo1 and Glo2, and a catalytic
amount of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the cytoplasm of
cells (Fig. 1A). The major function of the glyoxalase path-
way is detoxification of the reactive dicarbonyl metabolite,
methylglyoxal, converting it to D-lactate. Methylglyoxal is
a highly potent glycating agent of protein that forms the
quantitatively major advanced glycation end product,
hydroimidazolone MG-H1, linked to protein inactiva-
tion and cell dysfunction (4,5) (Fig. 1B). Degradation of
methylglyoxal-modified proteins releases MG-H1 free ad-
duct from tissues for urinary excretion (4). The steady-state
level of protein MG-H1 is maintained at low tolerable levels
by Glo1 (3).
Abnormally high methylglyoxal concentration, dicarbonyl
stress, is a common characteristic of obesity and type 2
diabetes. It is severe in diabetes, driven by increased flux of

OBESITY STUDIES
 methylglyoxal formation and decreased Glo1 activity at sites
of vascular complications. Methylglyoxal is formed mainly
by the nonenzymatic degradation of triosephosphate inter-
mediates of glycolysis—a minor “leak” of ;0.05% triose-
phosphate flux. In obesity, dicarbonyl stress is mild and
triosephosphate flux is increased by glyceroneogenesis in
adipose tissue–liver cycling of triglycerides and free fatty
acids. Increased methylglyoxal protein modification in dicar-
bonyl stress is implicated as a mediator of impaired meta-
bolic and vascular health in obesity and diabetes (3).
An effective strategy to counter dicarbonyl stress is to
increase expression of Glo1 (6). We described a functional
regulatory antioxidant response element (ARE) in human
GLO1 with basal and inducible expression upregulated
by transcriptional factor nuclear factor E2-related factor
2 (Nrf2). Recent advances in Nrf2 regulation suggested
that potent induction of Glo1 expression could be achieved
by a synergistic combination of Nrf2 activators addressing
different regulatory features (7,8). In this study, we sought
to screen dietary bioactive compounds for Glo1 inducer
activity in a functional reporter assay, confirm hits in cell
culture, and evaluate an optimized Glo1 inducer formula-
tion in a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover clinical
trial for improved metabolic and vascular health in over-
weight and obese subjects.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Screening of Glo1 Inducers Using GLO1-ARE
and Related Stable Transfectant Reporter Cell Lines
Stable transfectant luciferase reporter cell lines with ARE
transcriptional regulatory elements were developed from
human HepG2 cells, as described for quinone reductase
ARE (7), incorporating regulatory elements: GLO1-ARE or
functionally inactive mutant as negative control (ARE-1
and ARE1m in previous work) (6). Stable transfectant cell
lines were incubated with and without bioactive com-
pounds (0.625–20.0 mmol/L) for 6 h. Luciferase activity
was then determined in cell lysates, with correction for
blank response, and normalized to the highest effect
(100%) achieved with 10 mmol/L trans-resveratrol (tRES)
(6). Nrf2-dependent transcriptional response was verified
by small interfering RNA silencing of Nrf2. Cytotoxicity
was assessed after 24 h exposure by the MTT [3-(4,5-
dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide]
method (9). Screening hit criteria were as follows: in-
creased transcriptional response at #5 mmol/L without
significant cytotoxicity to human aortal endothelial cells
(HAECs) and BJ human foreskin fibroblasts in primary
culture. Dietary bioactive compound selection criteria
were ability to activate Nrf2 at concentrations achieved
or likely achievable at tolerable doses clinically and/or
decrease glycation and/or toxicity by methylglyoxal or
similar compounds.
ARE-Linked Gene and Other Cell Metabolism and
Functional Marker Gene Expression by Digital mRNA
Profiling and Immunoblotting
HAECs, BJ fibroblasts, and HepG2 cells (5 3 105 cells/
well) were seeded on sixwell plates in relevant medium
and cultured overnight at 37°C under 5% CO2/air. Cells
were treated with and without 5 mmol/L tRES, 5 mmol/L
hesperetin (HESP), and 5 mmol/L tRES plus HESP com-
bined or vehicle (0.002% dimethylsulfoxide) and cultured
further for up to 48 h. At the time points indicated,
mRNA was extracted and analyzed by the NanoString
nCounter method (10). Immunoblotting was performed
as previously described (6).
Clinical Study
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover
study of optimized Glo1 inducer was performed in 32
overweight and obese healthy subjects (Healthy Ageing
through functional food [HATFF]). The study was ap-
proved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee
West Midlands—Coventry & Warwickshire (project num-
ber 13/WM/0368) and registered at clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT02095873). The procedures followed were in accordance

 with institutional guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki.
Three participants failed to complete the study.
Main inclusion criteria were age 18–80 years, BMI 25–40
kg/m2, and normal, impaired fasting, or impaired postpran-
dial glucose. Main exclusion criteria were severe hypertri-
glyceridemia, uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular
disease, relevant renal or hepatic disease, diabetes, and
other relevant morbidity; severe excess alcohol consump-
tion (.14/21 units [8g]/week for women/men), smoking,
pharmacological treatment affecting glucose and lipid me-
tabolism or blood coagulation, taking herbal remedies,
known food allergies, pregnancy, and breast-feeding. All
subjects were evenly randomized in tRES-HESP and pla-
cebo arms (n = 16) by the Clinical Trials Unit, University
of Warwick. Treatment was one capsule daily for 8 weeks
and a washout period of 6 weeks—tRES-HESP (90 mg
tRES and 120 mg HESP) and placebo—with starch in
place of bioactives in hard gelatin capsules. Previous stud-
ies with dietary fiber supplementation indicated interven-
tion for at least 8 weeks is required for improved glycemic
control (11). Participants were advised to maintain their
usual diet, confirmed by dietary questionnaires at the start
and end of dosing periods, and physical activity, supported
by nurse and dietitian contact throughout the study.
Primary clinical end points were metabolic health (oral
glucose insulin sensitivity [OGIS] index in an oral glucose
tolerance test [OGTT] [75 g glucose; participants instructed
to eat carbohydrate-rich diet, .150 g/day, for at least 3
days before the test, followed by an overnight fast]) (12)
and vascular health (brachial artery flow-mediated dilata-
tion [FMD], including dilatation response to a subthera-
peutic dose [25 mg] of glyceryl nitrate [GTND]) (13). OGTT
and FMD/GTND assessments were performed at the start
and end of each treatment period between 8:00 A.M. and
10:00 A.M. in a quiet temperature-controlled room main-
tained at 23 6 1°C. Markers of vascular inflammation were
also assessed by commercial ELISA.
Venous blood samples were also drawn in the fasting
state prior to the OGTT. Safety assessment of tRES-HESP
coformulation was assessed by electrocardiogram and anal-
ysis of blood markers. Plasma methylglyoxal and glycation
and oxidation adducts in plasma protein and urine (second
void after overnight fast) were assayed by stable isotopic
dilution analysis liquid chromatography–tandem mass spec-
trometry (LC-MS/MS) (14,15).
Total tRES and HESP Urinary Metabolites
Total tRES and HESP urinary metabolites were deter-
mined by stable isotopic LC-MS/MS after deconjugation of
glucuronides and sulfates. Urine (20 mL), from which cells
had been sedimented and removed prior to storage,
with 42 mmol/L ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.9
(60 mL), internal standards (250 mmol/L [13C6]tRES and
10 mmol/L d4-HESP; 20 mL), and b-glucuronidase (5 mL,
85 units) and b-sulphatase (5 mL, 5 units), was incubated
for 2 h at 37°C in the dark. Deconjugation was validated
with authentic glucuronides and sulfates of tRES and
HESP before use. Thereafter, ice-cold methanol (100 mL)
was added for deproteinization, centrifuged (10,000g, 10 min,
4°C), and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Calibration curves were
constructed by analysis of 125–625 pmol tRES and HESP.
Cellular GSH and Oxidized Glutathione GSH–to–
oxidized glutathione
Cellular GSH and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were
assayed by stable isotopic dilution analysis LC-MS/MS.
Cells (;1 3 106 cells) were deproteinized with 10% tri-
chloroacetic acid (40 mL) containing 0.15% NaCl and
0.25% sodium azide in water and centrifuged (20,000g,
30 min, 4°C). An aliquot of supernatant (10 mL) was mixed
with 10 mL isotopic standard cocktail (100 pmol [13C2,
15N]
GSH and [13C4,
15N2]GSH–to–GSSG) and analyzed by LC-MS/
MS. Calibration standards contained 100–2,000 pmol GSH
and 5–100 pmol GSSG (Fig. 3).
Statistical Analysis
Data are mean 6 SD or SEM for parametric data and me-
dian (upper–lower quartile) for nonparametric data. Signifi-
cance testing in paired data was assessed by paired Student
t test and Wilcoxon signed rank test (for two study groups),
by ANOVA repeated measures and Friedman test (for
four study groups), and by correlation analysis by Pearson
and Spearman methods for parametric and nonparametric
data, respectively. For HATFF study power calculation, we
judged that decrease in area under the plasma glucose curve
(AUCg) of the OGTT would be 10%, compared with 30%
decrease with high cereal fiber intake (16). With a 30%
dropout, 32 subjects were required for a = 0.05 and power
(1 – b) = 0.80. Post hoc analysis of variables for highly
overweight and obese subgroups was performed to explore
BMI as a factor influencing responsiveness to Glo1 inducers.
RESULTS
Screening of Small-Molecule Glo1 Inducers
After screening of ;100 dietary bioactive compounds with
Nrf2 activator activity, the highest maximum GLO1-ARE
transcriptional activity response (Emax) was produced by
tRES. The lowest half-maximal effective concentration
(EC50) for GLO1-ARE transcriptional activity was found
with HESP. For tRES, EC50 = 2.52 6 0.19 mmol/L and
Emax 100 6 2%, and for HESP, EC50 = 0.59 6 0.01 mmol/L
and Emax 24.4 6 0.1% (Fig. 2A and B). In previous clinical
studies, dietary supplementation of 150 mg HESP achieved
a peak plasma concentration of 6.7 mmol/L (17), suggesting
that HESP may be a competent Glo1 inducer for clinical use
but with low maximal effect, and dietary supplementation of
500 mg tRES achieved a peak plasma concentration of ;0.3
mmol/L (18), eightfold lower than the EC50 for GLO1-ARE
response. To enhance efficacy, we studied the pharmacolog-
ical synergism of tRES and HESP together. Study of the
GLO1-ARE transcriptional response of 5 mmol/L HESP
with 0.625–10 mmol/L tRES showed that HESP combined
synergistically with tRES, decreasing the EC50 of tRES ap-
proximately twofold to 1.46 6 0.10 mmol/L while maintain-
ing the Emax (Fig. 2C). The predicted increase of GLO1-ARE

 transcriptional response from concentration response curves
of 0.1–1.0 tRES in the presence of 5 mmol/L HESP was 3-
to 79-fold, including up to 80% increase over additive
effects (Fig. 2D). This suggests that marked benefits may
accrue from use of tRES-HESP coformulation.
Safety assessments of tRES and HESP indicate that they
are highly tolerated (19,20). Studies of human BJ fibro-
blasts in primary culture showed no toxicity of tRES and
HESP individually or with 5 mmol/L combination with pri-
mary bioactive compound at concentrations #20 mmol/L.
tRES (40 mmol/L) with 5 mmol/L HESP and 40 mmol/L
HESP with and without 5 mmol/L tRES showed minor de-
crease in viability of BJ cells in vitro (Fig. 2E and F). tRES
(5 mmol/L) with 0.625 mmol/L HESP gave a minor increase
in cell number—possibly an effect of insulin-sensitizing
activity. (See below.) There was no toxicity of tRES,
HESP, or both combined in HAECs in primary culture
under similar conditions (Fig. 2G and H).
Validation of Glo1 Inducer Screening Results
and Functional Effects
To validate the Glo1 inducer studies, we measured the
change in Glo1 mRNA and protein and functional responses
in the human hepatocyte-like HepG2 cell line in vitro and
HAECs and BJ fibroblasts in primary culture. There was a
10–30% increase in Glo1 mRNA in cells incubated with
tRES and HESP and combined, and similar increases in
Glo1 protein (Fig. 2I–K). We then studied the effect on
functional markers: inflammatory response proteins and
matrix metalloproteinase. In HAECs, treatments decreased
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), receptor for
advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and E-selectin
protein, with synergistic effects on ICAM1 and RAGE
(Fig. 3A–C). In BJ fibroblasts, treatments decreased cellular
vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), RAGE, and matrix
metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), with synergism for tRES and
HESP in decrease of VCAM-1 and MMP-3 (Fig. 3D–F). This
suggests that the tRES and HESP treatment lowers basal
cell inflammation and extracellular matrix turnover.
Activation of Nrf2 is associated with increased cellular
GSH and GSSG ratio through increased expression of genes of
GSH synthesis and metabolism—particularly g-glutamylcysteine
ligase (modulatory and catalytic subunits [GCLM and GCLC])
and glutathione reductase. Treatment of HAECs, BJ fibro-
blasts, and HepG2 cells in vitro with 5 mmol/L tRES and
5 mmol/L HESP individually, however, did not change cellular
levels of GSH and GSSG, whereas treatment with 5 mmol/L
tRES and HESP combined increased cellular GSH content by
43% in BJ fibroblasts and 32% in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3G–L).
Increased cellular GSH concentration enhances in situ activity
of Glo1 (3).
We also studied time-dependent changes in expression
of ARE-linked genes and other genes linked to metabolism
and function in HAECs, BJ fibroblast, and HepG2 cells
by focused quantitative mRNA array (selected time
course responses are given in Supplementary Fig. 1A–
C). Overall, there were additive and synergistic changes
on gene expression of tRES and HESP combined treat-
ment. For example, in HAECs, mRNA of ARE-linked
genes glutathione transferase A4 (GTSA4), heme oxygen-
ase-1 (HMOX-1), GCLM, GCLC, and glutathione reduc-
tase were increased. tRES and HESP together decreased
ICAM1 mRNA. In BJ fibroblasts, tRES and HESP syner-
gized to increase mRNA of GSTP1, HMOX1, NQO1, and
aldoketo reductase 1C1 (AKR1C1) and to decrease ex-
pression of inflammation markers CCL2 and ICAM1. In
HepG2 cells, tRES and HESP combined synergistically to
increase mRNA of NQO1, GCLM, and GCLC, LDL receptor
(LDLR), hexokinase-2 (HK2), and 6-phosphofructokinase/
bisphosphatase-3 (PFKBP3).
Improved Clinical Metabolic and Vascular Health
With tRES-HESP Coformulation: HATFF Study
Coformulation of tRES-HESP was evaluated in healthy over-
weight and obese subjects. Twenty-nine subjects completed
the study. Characteristics of subjects at study entry are
given in Table 1. Subjects had mildly impaired glycemic
control, with only 9 subjects meeting criteria of prediabe-
tes; all participants were overweight or obese, 20 were
highly overweight (BMI .27.5 kg/m2), and 11 were obese
(BMI .30 kg/m2). tRES-HESP treatment increased urinary
excretion of tRES and HESP metabolites by .2,000-fold
and .100-fold, respectively, compared with placebo (Sup-
plementary Fig. 2A and B). Dietary questionnaires, urinary
excretion of pyrraline—an advanced glycation end product
sourced only from food (21), and fasting plasma ketone
body concentrations in the normal range in all subjects
(22) suggested that food consumption was similar through-
out the study (Table 2). Clinical safety indicators were
normal at study entry and remained unchanged through-
out the placebo and tRES-HESP treatment periods (Sup-
plementary Table 1).

 tRES-HESP produced a 22% increase in Glo1 activity
of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) post-
treatment compared with placebo in all subjects. PBMC
Glo1 activity was increased 27% in highly overweight/
obese and 30% in obese subgroups. Concomitant with
this there was a 37% decrease in plasma methylglyoxal
postsupplementation with tRES-HESP but not with pla-
cebo in highly overweight/obese subjects. There was no
change in plasma D-lactate concentration with tRES-HESP
treatment—a surrogate indicator of flux of methylglyoxal
formation (3) (Table 2). Therefore, increase of Glo1 activity
by tRES-HESP in PBMCs, also expected in tissues, likely

HPLC columns in series (50 3 2.1 mm and 250 3 2.1 mm, particle size 5 mm) at temperature of 30°C. Initial mobile phase was 0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid in water and the elution profile was 1–15 min, a linear gradient of 0–30% acetonitrile, and 15–16 min, isocratic 30%
acetonitrile; the flow rate was 0.2 mL/min and diverted into the mass spectrometer from 4 to 16 min. Mass spectrometric analysis was
performed using electrospray positive ionization mode with the following detection settings: capillary voltage 3.4 kV, source and desolva-
tion gas temperatures 120°C and 350°C, respectively; and cone and desolvation gas flows 146 and 550 L/h, respectively. For analyte
detection, the retention time, mass transition molecular ion>fragment ion, cone voltage, and collision energy were as follows: GSH, 11.7
min, 308.2 > 179.1 Da, 30 V, and 13 eV; [13C2,
15N]GSH, 11.7 min, 311.2 > 182.1 Da, 30 V, and 13 eV; GSSG, 14.4 min, 613.2 > 483.7 Da,
52 V, and 18 eV; and [13C4,
15N2]GSSG, 14.4 min, 619.2 > 489.7 Da, 52 V, and 18 eV. For GSH and GSSG, limits of detection were 0.92 pmol
and 1.46 pmol, analytical recoveries 97 6 2% and 93 6 6%, and intrabatch coefficients of variation 8.8% and 10.9% (n = 6), respectively.

 decreased plasma methylglyoxal concentration without
change in flux of methylglyoxal formation.
With tRES-HESP treatment, there was a positive corre-
lation of change in OGIS from baseline (DOGIS) with
BMI (r = 0.45, P , 0.05) (Fig. 4A). No similar correlation
occurred with placebo. In the subset of highly overweight
subjects, there was an increase in OGIS from baseline with
tRES-HESP (DOGIS = 42 mL $ min21 $ m22) (Table 2 and
Fig. 4B) but not with placebo. This effect was further enhanced
in obese subjects only (DOGIS = 58 mL $ min21 $ m22) (Table
2). The main contributory factors to this effect were: 1)
decreased fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (P , 0.01) and 2)
decreased AUCg (P , 0.03, ANOVA) (Table 2).
There was a negative correlation of change in FPG from
baseline (DFPG) to BMI with tRES-HESP treatment (r =
20.41, P , 0.05) (Fig. 4C). No similar correlation occurred
with placebo. In highly overweight subjects, there was a 5%
decrease in FPG postsupplementation with tRES-HESP
(Fig. 4D). This effect was further enhanced in obese sub-
jects only (29%) (Table 2). There was also decreased AUCg
in the OGTT with tRES-HESP treatment in the highly over-
weight study group to a similar extent (28%; P , 0.03,
ANOVA) (Table 2). Therefore, tRES-HESP treatment would
likely decrease exposure to increase glucose concentration
in the fasting and postprandial states in the highly over-
weight and obese populations.
Concomitant with increased metabolic health there were
small decreases in BMI and body weight in the obese
subjects with tRES-HESP: 20.5 kg/m2 and 20.3 kg, respec-
tively. Measurement at morning study visits excluded effect
of diurnal variation. Other small changes were 3% increase
in estimated glomerular filtration rate and 9% decrease in
plasma urea with tRES-HESP. Further clinical variables un-
changed by tRES-HESP treatment are given in Table 2.
In assessment of vascular function, we found no
change in FMD or GTND. For FMD-to-GTND ratio,
normalizing from baseline, in the highly overweight/obese
subject group, the 95% CI for DFMD/DGTND with tRES-
HESP was 0.13–2.11. Assessment of markers of vascular
inflammation revealed a decrease in change of soluble
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) from base-
line with tRES-HESP in all subjects compared with increase
with placebo: 23.6 6 6.9 vs. 25.8 6 6.9 ng/mL (P , 0.01), a
reversal of ;10% of postsupplementation placebo level.
To assess the effect on protein glycation in the HATFF
study, we analyzed glycation and oxidative damage of
plasma protein. Plasma protein MG-H1 was unchanged
with tRES-HESP treatment (Table 1). We propose that
this unexpected finding may be due to improved vascular
function with tRES-HESP treatment, decreasing transca-
pillary escape rate of albumin (23) and increasing vascular
half-life of albumin and thereby maintaining methylglyoxal
plasma protein glycation. The increase of transcapillary es-
cape rate of albumin in obesity was 36% (24)—a magnitude
similar to that of the decrease of plasma methylglyoxal
herein with tRES-HESP. The oxidative cross-link dityr-
osine was decreased 21% with tRES-HESP treatment but
not with placebo (Table 2 and Fig. 4E). To assess the
whole-body formation of MG-H1, we measured the uri-
nary excretion of MG-H1 free adduct, corrected for MG-
H1 absorbed from food by extrapolating regression of
urinary MG-H1 on urinary pyrraline in all subjects to
zero pyrraline (and hence no contribution from food)
(25,26) (Fig. 4F). The flux of endogenously generated
MG-H1 adducts was ;13 nmol/mg creatinine at baseline
and decreased by 14% with tRES-HESP treatment but not
with placebo (Table 2 and Fig. 4G). The pentose-derived
cross-link, pentosidine, is a quantitatively minor and fluo-
rescent glycation adduct. Urinary excretion of pentosidine
free adduct was decreased 32% by treatment with tRES-
HESP but not by placebo (Fig. 4H).
We analyzed changes in gene expression of PBMCs in a
focused quantitative mRNA array study. In all subjects,
there was increased expression of GLO1 and decreased
inflammation-linked genes, IL8 and PTGS2. In obese
subjects, there was also decreased expression of CCL2
and TNFA (Table 3).

Data are mean 6 SD or number of each classification (class

defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) $140 mmHg or diastolic
blood pressure $90 mmHg on 4 occasions. Thirty-two subjects
were recruited at the University Hospitals of Coventry and
Warwickshire National Health Service Trust in the period May–
July 2014; the last participant left the study December 2014. At
prescreening, assessments made were 2-h plasma glucose in
an OGTT and A1C, aspartate transaminase, alanine transami-
nase, plasma triglycerides, and plasma creatinine (for estimated
glomerular filtration rate [GFR]). One participant was withdrawn
from the study for diverging from the protocol, and 2 dropped
out: 1 while on placebo and 1 on treatment. The 2 participants
who dropped out stated personal reasons related to interfering
duties and therefore difficulties attending the scheduled follow-
up appointments. None of the participants reported any relevant
side effects (nausea, loss of appetite, gastrointestinal side
effects, or other symptoms). Study data were analyzed per
protocol (n = 29).

 found in oranges—administered together acted synergis-
tically to improve FPG, AUCg, OGIS, sICAM-1, arterial
function, and renal function in highly overweight subjects.
Most clinical effects were found in the highly overweight
subgroup (BMI .27.5 kg/m2), indicating that the tRES-
HESP coformulation has decreasing potency as the lean
range of BMI is approached. This suggests a resetting to
good metabolic and vascular health.
tRES and HESP administered individually in previous
studies were ineffective. From meta-analysis, it was
concluded that tRES does not affect glycemic status in
overweight and obese human subjects (27). This is at odds
with evidence from rodent models (28) and is likely due
to interspecies differences in pharmacology, host interac-
tions, and maximum tolerable dose. HESP absorbed from
clinical dosing with hesperidin did not improve plasma
glucose or insulin resistance (29).
We arrived at the tRES-HESP formulation through
maximizing induction of Glo1 expression. While increased
Glo1 expression likely contributes to the observed beneficial
health effects (3), changes in other gene expression occurred—
such as induction of antioxidant enzymes and GSH
synthesis (Fig. 3H and I and Supplementary Fig. 1), and their
interplay may also mediate the overall health benefit achieved.
We exploited the regulatory ARE of GLO1 to increase expres-
sion (6). We limited the small-molecule inducer screen to non-
toxic dietary bioactive compounds of known or suspected
Nrf2 activation activity to provide an option for use of Glo1
inducers as functional food supplements as well as pharma-
ceuticals. tRES and HESP also have a .50-fold safety margin

 at doses used in the HATFF study (19,20). Activation of Nrf2
by dietary bioactive compounds is mostly studied through
ARE-linked induction of NQO1 or HMOX1 expression.
Small-molecule activators of Nrf2 increase expression of dif-
ferent ARE-linked gene subsets (6,7)—likely due to the
ability of Nrf2 activators to recruit the requisite accessory
proteins and increase nuclear concentration of functionally
active Nrf2 to the level required for increased expression of
the ARE-linked gene of interest (7,8). A specific functional
screen for GLO1-ARE transcriptional activation was there-
fore required.
Activation of Nrf2 by tRES has been studied previously by
induction of HMOX1 expression (30). Herein we found that
tRES also induces expression of Glo1 with high Emax. Our
recent studies (7,8) and those of others (31) suggest that this
is achieved by preventing nuclear acetylation and inactivation
of Nrf2 via increasing in situ activity of sirtuin-1. At low
tRES concentrations, this occurs through inhibition of
cAMP phosphodiesterases, activation of AMPK, and
increased NAD+. HESP may also synergize for increased
activity of sirtuin-1 through activation of AMPK by the
protein kinase A pathway (32,33).
Clinically achievable concentrations of tRES at highly
tolerable doses are lower than the EC50 for induction of
Glo1 expression, however, so synergism with HESP is re-
quired to achieve increased Glo1 expression in clinical
translation. HESP may activate Nrf2 through induction
and activation of protein kinase A, upstream of fyn ki-
nase, which drives Nrf2 translocational oscillations and
ARE-linked gene expression (8,33). HESP is a partial
agonist (Fig. 2B), which is likely due to inhibitory nuclear
acetylation of Nrf2 blocking a high Emax. Combination
with tRES and HESP provides for faster nuclear translo-
cation and decreased inactivation of Nrf2 (7,8,31). Use of
HESP rather than related dietary glycoside hesperidin
found in citrus fruits (34) is likely crucial: HESP has
;70-fold greater potency in Nrf2 activation and higher
bioavailability than hesperidin (35).
tRES-HESP increased OGIS to levels typical of healthy, lean
subjects. The magnitude of DOGIS, 42–58 mL $ min21 $ m22,
is comparable to that achieved with pharmaceutical treatment
of patients with type 2 diabetes (for example, 1.7 g metformin
per day, DOGIS = increase of 54 mL $ min21 $ m22) (36) and
extreme weight loss with gastric band surgery in morbid

 obesity (DOGIS = increase of 62 mL $ min21 $ m22) (37).
These effects suggest the tRES-HESP can support thera-
peutic improvement of insulin sensitivity in highly over-
weight populations. OGIS was initially proposed as a
marker of insulin resistance but is also improved with
increased b-cell sensitivity to glucose and decreased
glucose absorption (38). Regarding insulin resistance, de-
creased activity of FGF21 due to downregulation of the
FGF21 receptor cofactor b-Klotho may be involved (39).
Methylglyoxal-driven protein glycation decreased expres-
sion of b-Klotho (40). By inducing Glo1 expression and
decreasing methylglyoxal protein glycation, therefore, we
likely corrected the functional deficit of b-Klotho and
reengaged FGF21. This explains the resetting of insulin
sensitivity to normal levels with the response greater
for higher-BMI subject groups. Characteristics of in-
creased b-Klotho was its blocking of inflammatory sig-
naling to downregulate proinflammatory mediators IL8,
MCP1, ICAM-1, and RAGE (40) and, via decreasing
MCP-1, also suppressing of PTGS2 (41) (Fig. 5). All
features of this transcriptional signature were found
in PBMCs of the HATFF study. Other effects increasing
OGIS may be increased pancreatic b-cell sensitivity to
glucose (42), decreased intestinal absorption of glucose
(43), changes of gut microbiota, and decreased break-
down and absorption of starch (44) (Fig. 5).
The 5% decrease in FPG herein exceeds and matches
effects of metformin and Olristat, respectively, in similar
intervention trials in overweight/obese subjects (45,46).
Decrease in FPG in the normal range is associated with
reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes (47).
Decreased urinary excretion of pentosidine by tRES-
HESP may be linked to decreased oxidative stress and
decreased pentose precursors expected from improved
insulin resistance (48).
tRES-HESP treatment produced an increase in DFMD/
DGTND. The effect is likely produced by improved nitric
oxide responsiveness in both endothelium and smooth
muscle cells (13) related to induction of Glo1 and pre-
vention of methylglyoxal glycation–driven impairment of
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (49). tRES-HESP also de-
creased dityrosine content of plasma protein. Dityrosine is
an oxidative cross-link of tyrosine residues and is a dom-
inant cross-link of the extracellular matrix (50). Plasma
protein dityrosine may be a surrogate marker of this and
hence be reporting decreased dityrosine cross-linking,
which may contribute to improved arterial function.
tRES-HESP decreased sICAM-1 in the HATFF study.
The cell studies herein suggest that this is likely linked to
decreased ICAM-1 expression. ICAM-1 expression was
decreased in Glo1 transgenic rats (51). In clinical studies,
tRES and HESP individually did not decrease ICAM1
(52,53). sICAM-1 correlates with atherosclerosis burden
assessed by coronary artery calcification and is a risk pre-
dictor of cardiovascular disease (54).
In summary, we present evidence that pharmaceutical
doses of tRES and HESP coformulation produce improved
metabolic and vascular health in overweight and obese
subjects.
