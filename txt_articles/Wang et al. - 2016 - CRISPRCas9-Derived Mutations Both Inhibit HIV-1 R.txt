viral replication suppression and viral
escape.

SUMMARY
Cas9 cleaves specific DNA sequences with the assis-
tance of a programmable single guide RNA (sgRNA).
Repairing this broken DNA by the cell’s error-prone
non-homologous
end
joining
(NHEJ)
machinery
leads to insertions and deletions (indels) that often
impair DNA function. Using HIV-1, we have now
demonstrated that many of these indels are indeed
lethal for the virus, but that others lead to the emer-
gence of replication competent viruses that are resis-
tant to Cas9/sgRNA. This unexpected contribution of
Cas9 to the development of viral resistance is facili-
tated by some indels that are not deleterious for viral
replication, but that are refractory to recognition by
the same sgRNA as a result of changing the target
DNA sequences. This observation illustrates two
opposite outcomes of Cas9/sgRNA action, i.e., inac-
tivation of HIV-1 and acceleration of viral escape,
thereby potentially limiting the use of Cas9/sgRNA
in HIV-1 therapy.
INTRODUCTION
CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic re-
peats)/Cas9 was originally discovered in bacteria as a mecha-
nism of adaptive immunity against infection by bacteriophages
(Barrangou et al., 2007; Bolotin et al., 2005; Mojica et al., 2005;
Pourcel et al., 2005). This machinery utilizes RNA as a guide
to target the Cas9 endonuclease to the bacteriophage DNA
that is subsequently cleaved and degraded (Barrangou et al.,
2007). Successful adaptation of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to
mammalian cells marks a new era of genome engineering (Cho
et al., 2013; Cong et al., 2013; Jinek et al., 2013; Mali et al.,
2013). By modifying the sequence of the single guide RNA
(sgRNA) that associates with Cas9, it may be possible to target
and edit virtually any DNA sequence.
The 20-nucleotide sequence at the 50 end of sgRNA binds to
target DNA through Watson-Crick base-pairing. In addition to
this RNA-DNA hybrid-mediated recognition, Cas9 also needs
to detect a multi-nucleotide sequence that is adjacent to the
target DNA, which is called the protospacer adjacent motif
(PAM). After Cas9 cleaves the target DNA at a position three nu-
cleotides from the PAM, the double-stranded DNA break is often
repaired by the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) machinery
(Hsu et al., 2014). NHEJ repair is error-prone and introduces
short insertions and deletions (indels) that survive Cas9/sgRNA
cleavage and often disturb the function of target DNA, which
empowers Cas9/sgRNA to play a role in genome engineering.
Among many applications, Cas9/sgRNA has been used to
inactivate the viral DNA genome and thereby inhibit viral infection
(Kennedy and Cullen, 2015). A number of viruses have been
tested in this regard, including adenovirus (Bi et al., 2014),
herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (Bi et al., 2014; Suenaga
et al., 2014), human papillomavirus (Kennedy et al., 2014,
2015; Zhen et al., 2014), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (Wang and
Quake, 2014; Yuen et al., 2015), vaccinia virus (Yuan et al.,
2015), hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Dong et al., 2015; Karimova
et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2014; Ramanan et al., 2015; Seeger
and Sohn, 2014; Wang et al., 2015; Zhen et al., 2015), and HIV
type 1 (HIV-1) (Dampier et al., 2014; Ebina et al., 2013; Hu
et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015; Liao et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2015).
sgRNAs have been designed to target viral promoter DNA or viral
genes that are essential for viral replication. Indels that are
created by the NHEJ machinery following Cas9 cleavage ablate
viral gene function and thus lead to suppression of viral replica-
tion. Dual sgRNAs have also been designed to eliminate a frag-
ment of viral DNA (Wang et al., 2015). Taking advantage of the
two long terminal repeats (LTRs) at the 50 and 30 termini of the in-
tegrated HIV-1 DNA, a single sgRNA targeting the LTR has been
shown to cause the deletion of nearly full-length HIV-1 DNA
(Ebina et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2014). Not only can Cas9/sgRNA
inhibit new viral infection, it can also participate in the clearance
of latent viral DNA including that of HBV, herpes viruses, and
HIV-1 (Hu et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2014; Wang and Quake,
2014). In spite of successful suppression of viral replication in
multiple studies, however, it is not known whether viruses might
be able to escape from Cas9/sgRNA inhibition. In order to
answer this important question, we have utilized HIV-1 as a
model and performed viral evolution experiments in CD4+

 T cells that express Cas9/sgRNA that targets the HIV-1 genome.
We now show viral escape from Cas9/sgRNA on the basis of
mutations in the viral DNA sequence that is targeted by sgRNA.
RESULTS
HIV-1 Escapes from Suppression Mediated by Cas9/
sgRNA
To investigate whether HIV-1 is able to escape from Cas9/
sgRNA-mediated inhibition, we first generated CD4+ SupT1
cell lines that stably expressed both Cas9 and sgRNA that we
previously showed could inhibit HIV-1 production in transient
transfection experiments (Zhu et al., 2015). These Cas9 and
sgRNA genes were stably transduced into SupT1 cells using a
lentiviral vector (Sanjana et al., 2014). These Cas9/sgRNA-ex-
pressing cells showed growth capacity similar to that of the con-
trol cells (Figure S1A). The T4 sgRNA targets the overlapping
open reading frames (ORFs) of HIV-1 gag/pol genes, while T10
targets the overlapping ORFs of HIV-1 env/rev genes (Figure 1A).
Both viral targets are very conserved in HIV-1 sequences that are
registered in the HIV database (Figure S1B). Since each of these
two sgRNAs targets two specific viral genes, we conjectured
that the genetic barrier should be high for HIV-1 to mutate and
escape from inhibition. A control SupT1 cell line expressed
Cas9 only.
We first tested these SupT1 cell lines by exposing them to the
NL4-3 HIV-1 strain for a short term of infection. The results
showed that T4 or T10 sgRNA together with Cas9 reduced the
number of HIV-1 infected cells (Figure 1B) and diminished the
production of infectious viruses (Figure 1C). To demonstrate
that these reductions had resulted from the action of Cas9/
sgRNA that causes indels, we extracted total cellular DNA
from the infected cells, amplified the viral DNA region that was
targeted by the T4 or T10 sgRNA, cloned the PCR products,
and sequenced the DNA clones. Although no mutations were
detected in the targeted viral DNA that was extracted from the
infected control SupT1 cells, rich arrays of indels were identified
in viral DNA from the infected SupT1 cells that expressed T4 or
T10 sgRNA (Figures 1D and 1E). The percentages of indels for
the T4 and T10 sgRNAs were approximately 25% and 30%,
respectively. We also tested a number of these indels by insert-
ing them into the HIV-1 DNA and observed that the majority of
them abolished the production of infectious viruses in addition
to the two substitution mutations that produced as much infec-
tious viruses as the wild-type viral DNA did (Figure S1C). In addi-
tion to the NL4-3 HIV-1 strain, we further tested the T4 sgRNA
against two primary HIV-1 isolates 89.6 and YU-2, as well as
three transmitted founder viruses CH040, CH077, and CH106.
The results showed that Cas9/T4 sgRNA caused indels in these
viral DNA and strongly inhibited the production of each of these
latter viruses (Figures S1D and S1E). Together, these results
confirm that Cas9/sgRNA inhibits HIV-1 infection by introducing
various mutations into viral DNA.
We next performed HIV-1 evolution experiments and moni-
tored viral growth over prolonged times by measuring viral
reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in culture supernatants. The
results showed that HIV-1 replication was delayed in SupT1 cells
expressing T4 or T10 sgRNA compared to viral replication in
control SupT1 cells (Figure 2A). Nonetheless, viral production
eventually peaked in the T4 and T10 SupT1 cells, showing that
HIV-1 had escaped from suppression by Cas9/sgRNA. To
further demonstrate viral escape, we collected viruses at the
peaks of viral RT levels in the control, T4, and T10 cells, and
then utilized the same RT levels of each virus to infect the corre-
sponding SupT1 cell line. The T4 and T10 viruses displayed even
moderately faster replication kinetics than the control virus in this
second round of replication (Figure 2B), which suggests that the
escape viruses might have gained mutations that improve viral
infectivity.
The Cas9/sgRNA-Resistant HIV-1 Bears Mutations in
the Viral DNA Region that Is Targeted by sgRNA
To identify the mutations that led to viral escape, we extracted
RNA from relevant viruses, amplified the sgRNA target sequence
in the viral genome by RT-PCR, cloned the PCR products, and
sequenced the DNA clones. No mutations were found in the
genome of viruses that were produced by the control SupT1
cells. In contrast, five different mutations were identified in the
47 DNA clones that were sequenced for the T4 escape virus (Fig-
ure 2C), with a dominant substitution being G2258A (81%)
that causes a R490K change in Gag. Less frequent muta-
tions include A2259G (13%), C2256A/A2257C/A2259G (2%),
C2252T/G2258A (2%), and a 2258-ACCCCCC-2263 (2%) inser-
tion. It is noted that all mutations are located adjacent to where
Cas9 cleaves the target DNA, i.e., 3 nt from the PAM (Figure 2C),
which suggests that these mutations are likely the result of Cas9
activity. In the case of T10 sgRNA, 19 different mutations were
identified in 42 DNA clones that were sequenced (Figure 2D),

(B) T4 and T10 sgRNAs diminished the number of SupT1 cells that were infected by HIV-1 over 36 hr. Cas9-FLAG and viral p24 were stained with anti-FLAG and
anti-p24 antibodies and positive cells were scored by flow cytometry. The controls (Ctrl) are cells that expressed Cas9-FLAG alone. The uninfected SupT1 cells
served as a negative control. The representative results of three independent experiments are shown.
(C) Levels of viruses that were produced by SupT1 cells after a 36 hr infection by HIV-1. The total amounts of viruses were determined by measuring levels of viral
RT activity in the supernatants. The levels of infectious HIV-1 in the culture supernatants were determined by infecting the TZM-bl indicator cells. The results
shown are the average of three independent experiments. The levels of viruses that were produced by the control cells were arbitrarily set as 100 (***p < 0.0001).

 with a dominant mutation C8500T present in 38% of DNA clones.
Other mutations were clustered at the Cas9 cleavage site in the
target DNA. It is noted that three mutations (i.e., 17, 18, and 19)
contain small indels that cause frameshifts in the env and rev
genes and are expected to impair the generation of functional
Env and Rev proteins (Figure 2D).

G2258A (T4-1 in C), A2259G (T4-2), and C2256A/
A2257C/A2259G (T4-3). Three mutations in the T10
escape viruses were also tested for resistance
to T10 sgRNA. They were C8500T (T10-1 in D),
CCT(8506-8508)GGC (T10-2), and CC(8506-8507)
GG (T10-4). The virus production was monitored by
measuring levels of viral RT activity in culture
supernatants over different time intervals.
See also Figure S2.
We next tested which of these muta-
tions confer resistance to Cas9/sgRNA
by
inserting
them
into
the
parental
HIV-1 DNA. These viral mutants were
as infectious as the wild-type virus (Fig-
ure S2A). We used the same levels of
mutated viruses to infect control or cor-
responding
sgRNA-expressing
SupT1
cells.
In
one-round
infection
experi-
ments, similar levels of the HIV-1 mu-
tants were produced from the sgRNA-
expressing
SupT1
cells
and
control
cells, as opposed to the marked inhibi-
tion of wild-type HIV-1 by the sgRNA
(Figure S2B). This resistant phenotype
was confirmed by documenting similar replication kinetics
of these viral mutants in the sgRNA-expressing cells and in
control cells (Figure 2E). Together, these results demonstrate
that HIV-1 is able to escape from Cas9/sgRNA suppres-
sion by accumulating mutations in the PAM/sgRNA target
sequence.

 HIV-1 Escapes from sgRNA that Targets the U3 Region
In addition to ablating HIV-1 genes, sgRNAs have been designed to
targettheHIV-1U3 region(Hu etal.,2014).ThislattertypeofsgRNA
together with Cas9 leads to cleavage at the two U3 regions that are
located at the 50 and 30 ends of HIV-1 proviral DNA and thereby re-
sults in removal of the viral genome that is integrated into cellular
DNA. Deletion of the entire viral genome should preclude HIV-1
escape from sgRNA-mediatedinhibition. To test this,we generated
SupT1 cell lines that stably expressed Cas9 and the LTR-B sgRNA
thathadbeendesignedtotargettheHIV-1U3region(Figure3A)(Hu
etal.,2014).Theresultsofone-roundinfectionexperimentsshowed
strong inhibition of HIV-1 production from LTR-B SupT1 cells (Fig-
ure 3B) and that Cas9/LTR-B led to indels in the U3 region of HIV-1
DNA (Figure 3C). Although Cas9/LTR-B initially suppressed HIV-1
replication (Figure 3D), viral escape was subsequently observed
(Figure 3E). Sequencing the genome of the escape viruses revealed
a variety of indels in the U3 region that is targeted by LTR-B (Fig-
ure 3F). In contrast to the T4 and T10 escape mutations that are

 nucleotide substitutionsand thus maintain the ORFs of the targeted
viral genes, the LTR-B escape viruses contained indels that are
reminiscent of indels caused by the cleavage of Cas9. This differ-
ence is mainly because LTR-B targets a sequence within U3 that
is not essential for efficient HIV-1 replication in SupT1 cells.
In order to further demonstrate that the HIV-1 escapes from
Cas9/sgRNA inhibition is not limited to specific sgRNAs, we
tested five more sgRNAs that target different regions in the viral
env gene. These include the EnvT1, EnvV2, EnvT3, EnvV4, and
EnvV5 (Figure S3A), among which the EnvT1 and EnvT3 sgRNAs
have previously been shown to inhibit HIV-1 infection (Liao et al.,
2015). The results of viral evolution experiments showed that
HIV-1 escaped from each of these five sgRNAs (Figure S3B). It
was noted that HIV-1 escaped from some sgRNAs (such as
EnvT1 and EnvV4) faster than from others (such as EnvT3,
EnvV2, and EnvV5). These different rates of viral escape from
different sgRNAs can be a result of different degrees of conser-
vation of the target sequences, as suggested by a recent study
(Wang et al., 2016), or a result of different efficiencies of Cas9
cleavage at different target sites. Mutations were identified in
the sgRNA target region in the genome of the escape viruses
(Figure S3C). Together, these data support the conclusion that
HIV-1 is able to escape from Cas9/sgRNA inhibition as a result
of mutations in viral DNA sequence that is targeted by sgRNA.
Cas9/sgRNA-Derived Indels Represent One Source of
HIV-1 Escape Mutations
The location of some of the escape mutations to the cleavage site
of Cas9 within the target DNA suggests that these mutations might
have been derived from the action of Cas9/sgRNA. To further
investigatethispossibility,weutilizedtheIlluminaMiSeqtechnique
to achieve a deeper coverage of the indels that are caused by
Cas9/sgRNA in HIV-1 DNA. To this end, Cas9/sgRNA-expressing
SupT1 cells were infected by HIV-1 for 36 hr, which permits one
round of HIV-1 infection and minimizes re-infection (Holmes
et al., 2015). The recorded indels in viral DNA within this relatively
short time window (36 hr) thus represent a snapshot of the
numerous indels that are generated by Cas9/sgRNA in long-term
HIV-1 evolution experiments. Given the relatively high error rate
of the Illumina MiSeq technique, single nucleotide substitutions
were excluded from further analysis if frequency was <5%. We
also registered mutations in the escape viruses using the MiSeq
technique and compared the data to indels from the transiently
infected SupT1 cells. Our expectation was that some of the muta-
tions inthe escapeviruseswould beattributabletoindelsthatwere
introduced by Cas9/sgRNA into viral DNA, and that enrichment of
some indels in the escape viral population would be observed if
these indels had been selected by the virus for escape.
In the infected control SupT1 cells that did not express sgRNA,
very few indels were identified in HIV-1 DNA (Table S1). The fre-
quencies of these indels were often <0.1%. Consistently, viruses
that had been passaged in the control cells in the evolution ex-
periments contained very few indels, and these indels occurred
at very low frequencies (Table S1). These results suggest that
neither HIV-1 RT nor the Illumina MiSeq technique introduces
frequent indels.
In the transiently infected T4 sgRNA-expressing SupT1 cells,
164 different indels were identified across the PAM/T4 sgRNA
target region, with 38 located at the cleavage site of Cas9 (be-
tween positions 3 and 4) (Figures 4A and 4B; Table S2). The ma-
jority of these indels had frequencies below 0.1%. Twenty-two of
the 164 indels (13%) cause amino acid substitutions without dis-
rupting the ORFs of Gag and/or Pol and thus may produce viable
viruses. In the T4 escape viruses, two single nucleotide substitu-
tions were identified at frequencies of 80% and 7% (Figure 4B;
Table S2). Although these two substitutions were also observed
in the viral DNA from the transiently infected T4 SupT1 cells, their
very low frequencies in the latter setting suggest that they might
be MiSeq errors. Thirty-seven indels were identified in the escape
viruses, of which one had a frequency of 7% (Figure 4B; Table
S2). Twenty-eight of the 37 (76%) indels cause amino acid substi-
tutions and do not disrupt the ORFs of Gag and/or Pol (Table S2),
which shows an enrichment for these potentially viable indels in
the escape virus population compared to the 13% in the infected
cells. Seven common indels were identified between the T4
escape viruses and the transiently infected T4 SupT1 cells (Table
S2). These data suggest that Cas9/T4 sgRNA-derived indels
were archived in HIV-1 genomes, even though they did not domi-
nate the population of the escape viruses. This is likely because
the single nucleotide mutation G2258A (80%) is much superior
in terms of viral fitness and resistance to Cas9/T4 sgRNA.
When we examined the T10 sgRNA indels in the transiently in-
fected T10 SupT1 cells, 207 different indels were identified that
disrupt the PAM/T10 target sequence, the majority of which
were present at <0.1% frequency (Figure 4C; Table S3). Fifty-
seven of these indels were located directly at the Cas9 cleavage
site (between positions 3 and 4) and 39 of the 207 (19%) indels
cause amino acid substitutions. In the T10 escape viruses, 69
different indels were identified, with three having frequencies of
11%, 14%, and 28%, which shows enrichment of these indels
during HIV-1 evolution toward escape (Figure 4C; Table S3).
Fifty-five of these 69 indels (80%) cause amino acid substitutions
without disrupting the ORFs of the coded genes, which again
shows viral selection of potentially viable indels during evolution
toward escape from Cas9/sgRNA inhibition. Nineteen common
indels were identified between the T10 escape viruses and the
transiently infected T10 cells, of which one was present at
11% in the escape virus population (Figure 4C; Table S3).
Last, 285 different indels of low frequency were identified in
LTR-B SupT1 cells that were infected by HIV-1 for 36 hr (Fig-
ure 4D; Table S4). In the LTR-B escape viruses, the results of
MiSeq revealed 136 different indels, of which two were present
at frequencies of 17% and 37% (Figure 4D; Table S4). Sixty-
five common indels were identified between these two indel
groups, including those with frequencies of 17% and 37% (Fig-
ure 4D; Table S4). Together, these results indicate that indels
that were derived from the action of Cas9/sgRNA in the infected
cells were represented in the viral population, and that some of
these became enriched during viral evolution and contributed
to viral escape from the inhibition by Cas9/sgRNA.
DISCUSSION
Here, we report viral escape from Cas9/sgRNA-mediated inhibi-
tion of replication. In some ways, it may not seem surprising that
HIV-1 is able to escape from Cas9/sgRNA since HIV-1 can

 develop resistance to antiviral drugs, immune responsiveness,
and other types of pressure. However, resistance in these cases
is mostly due to an accumulation of resistance mutations that
derive from the error-prone RT and certain cellular factors such
as APOBEC3G (Jern et al., 2009). In contrast, Cas9/sgRNA is
itself a DNA sequence-specific mutagen and provides an inde-
pendent source of resistance mutations. An analogy is inhibition
of HIV-1 by RNAi (Manjunath et al., 2013), since both Cas9/
sgRNA and RNAi utilize RNA as a guide to impede HIV-1 infec-
tion, even though RNAi leads to cleavage of viral RNA and leaves
viral DNA intact. Thus, RNAi does not itself introduce mutations
into the viral genome, whereas Cas9/sgRNA can directly alter
viral DNA sequences. One common mechanism behind viral
escape from the Cas9/sgRNA and RNAi involves mutating the
viral sequence that is targeted by sgRNA or small interfering
(si)RNA.
We have shown that the indels generated by Cas9/sgRNA
confer resistance against Cas9/sgRNA. Following recognition
of PAM by Cas9, the adjacent target DNA unwinds and initially
binds to the first 10-nt seed sequence of sgRNA (Jiang et al.,
2015). Cas9 then cleaves the target DNA at a position three nu-
cleotides away from PAM. The NHEJ machinery is then recruited
to the double-stranded DNA break. While repairing this DNA
lesion, NHEJ often introduces insertion or deletion mutations
(Hsu et al., 2014). These indels result in a change in the target
DNA sequence, thus preventing sgRNA from binding and leading
to resistance to Cas9/sgRNA. If the sgRNA targets a viral DNA
sequence that is not essential for viral replication, then the indels
that are generated should quickly lead to the emergence of
Cas9/sgRNA-resistant, replication-competent viruses, as we
observed with the LTR-B sgRNA (Figure 4D). When essential viral
genes are targeted by sgRNA, the resistance-conferring indels
should contribute to viral escape if they minimally affect the func-
tions of the targeted viral genes. These latter indels should main-
tain the ORFs of viral genes and lead to only minimal changes in
numbers of amino acids (one or two). The results of our MiSeq
experiments reveal that these types of indels do exist in tran-
siently infected cells as well as in the escape viruses (Figures
4B and 4C). Results of our study do not exclude the possibility
that, when cells contain two or more copies of proviral DNA,
homologous repair may contribute to the generation of escape
mutations. Our findings are corroborated by a recent report
showing HIV-1 escapes from Cas9/sgRNA inhibition by mutating
the sgRNA target sequence (Wang et al., 2016).
The indels that are compatible with viral viability should be
taken into consideration if Cas9/sgRNA is used to treat virus
infection and genetic diseases. We expect that such indels
would contribute to virus escape not only when Cas9/sgRNA is
utilized to control new infections, but also in the context of elim-
inating latent viral DNA of herpes viruses, HBV, and HIV, among
others. This is because introduction of a viable indel into latent
viral DNA should lead to the mutated viral DNA being resistant
to Cas9/sgRNA, but still able to produce infectious viruses
upon activation. One potential solution might be to simulta-
neously target two or multiple sites in the viral genome with an
array of sgRNAs in the way that multiple siRNAs have been
used to durably suppress HIV-1 replication (Schopman et al.,
2010).
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Generation of Stably Transduced SupT1 Cell Lines
The lentiCRISPR(v2) DNA, with or without the T4, T10, LTR-B, EnvT1, EnvT3,
EnvV2, EnvV4, and EnvV5 sgRNA sequences, was transfected into HEK293T
cells together with DNA constructs that express the glycoprotein G of vesicular
stomatitis virus (VSV), HIV-1 Gag/Gag-Pol, and HIV-1 Rev as described (San-
jana et al., 2014). Viruses in the culture supernatants were used to infect the
SupT1 CD4+ T cell line. The stably transduced cell lines were selected with
puromycin (2 mg/ml). Expression of Cas9 (containing the FLAG tag) in these
cell lines was detected by immunostaining with anti-FLAG antibody and flow
cytometry. Reagents used and cell culture protocols are described in the
Supplemental Information.
HIV-1 Evolution Assay
The SupT1 cell lines that were stably transduced with lentiCRISPR(v2) were
infected with HIV-1 equivalent to 3 ng of viral p24. Cells were passaged every
4 days until cytopathic effect (CPE) and cell death were observed. Levels of
viruses inthe culturesupernatants weremonitoredbymeasuringviralRTactivity.
Identifying Escape Mutations
Viral RNA was extracted from escape viruses using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini
Kit (QIAGEN). The viral RNA regions that are targeted by sgRNAs were
amplified with the Superscript III One-Step RT-PCR Platinum Taq HiFi Kit
(Invitrogen). Primers are described in the Supplemental Information. RT-PCR
products were cloned into the PCR blunt vector and sequenced.
Illumina MiSeq
The sgRNA-targeted HIV-1 genomic regions were amplified using the primers
described in the Supplemental Information. The PCR products were
sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform at the McGill University and
Genome Quebec Innovation Centre. Raw fragments from the MiSeq sequencer
were first preprocessed to remove any trace of PhiX sequence and then
trimmed to remove sequencing adapters as well as low quality bases from
the 30-end (using Trimmomatic version 0.32) (Bolger et al., 2014). Numbers
of reads that underwent further analysis for each sample are presented in
Table S1. Resulting fragments were aligned to reference sequences using a
dynamic programming algorithm. This algorithm allows for more sensibility in
aligning reads that potentially include large indels with regards to the reference,
as compared to traditionally used next-generation sequencing mappers.
Finally, the aligned fragments were post-processed to classify each variation,
identify recurrent mutations in each sample, and quantify their occurrences.
Indels of each experiment are presented in Tables S1, S2, S3, and S4.
Statistical Analysis
p values were calculated with Student’s t test.
