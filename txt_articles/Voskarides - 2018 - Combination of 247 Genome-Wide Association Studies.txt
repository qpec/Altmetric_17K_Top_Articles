Abstract
Analysis of GLOBOCAN-2012 data shows clearly here that cancer incidence worldwide is highly related with low average
annual temperatures and extreme low temperatures. This applies for all cancers together or separately for many frequent
or rare cancer types (all cancers P¼ 9.49�10�18). Supporting fact is that Inuit people, living at extreme low temper-
atures, have the highest cancer rates today. Hypothesizing an evolutionary explanation, 240 cancer genome-wide asso-
ciation studies, and seven genome-wide association studies for cold and high-altitude adaptation were combined. A list of
1,377 cancer-associated genes was created to initially investigate whether cold selected genes are enriched with cancer-
associated genes. Among Native Americans, Inuit and Eskimos, the highest association was observed for Native Americans
(P¼ 6.7�10�5). An overall or a meta-analysis approach confirmed further this result. Similar approach for three
populations living at extreme high altitude, revealed high association for Andeans-Tibetans (P¼ 1.3�10�11). Overall
analysis or a meta-analysis was also significant. A separate analysis showed special selection for tumor suppressor genes.
These results can be viewed along with those of previous functional studies that showed that reduced apoptosis potential
due to specific p53 variants (the most important tumor suppressor gene) is beneficial in high-altitude and cold environ-
ments. In conclusion, this study shows that genetic variants selected for adaptation at extreme environmental conditions
can increase cancer risk later on age. This is in accordance with antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis.

Introduction
Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality world-
wide (Jemal et al. 2005). It is well established that genetic
factors have an important role in the etiology of many cancer
types (Amundadottir et al. 2004). A major question is why
cancer incidence, defined as the number of new cancer cases
occurring in a population within a specified period of time, is
so increased in human populations. Another major question
is why cancer incidence varies a lot among human popula-
tions (Ferlay et al. 2015). Analysis of epidemiological data
show that human populations in specific geographic areas
exhibit very high cancer incidence and mortality rates
(Sharma et al. 2015). This is known as spatial or geographic
distribution of cancer. There is limited information today
about the factors that determine this spatial distribution
(Sharma et al. 2015). Environmental and genetic factors are
equally suspected, since in multifactorial diseases environ-
mental variables and gene variants shape the risk per
population.
It is also well known that genetic variants that predispose
to a disease could have been selected by natural selection if
offering a survival advantage (Nesse 2011). This phenomenon
is known as “antagonistic pleiotropy,” first proposed by the
evolutionary biologist George Williams in 1957 as an
evolutionary explanation for senescence (Williams 1957).
This is a longstanding hypothesis for cancer, but to date
not any reliable evidence has been presented yet (Crespi
and Summers 2005; Vittecoq et al. 2013). Some scientists
believe that this phenomenon is not so rare and might be
a fundamental mechanism for the survival of deleterious
alleles predisposing for multifactorial diseases (Carter and
Nguyen 2011). On the other site, due to factual difficulties,
very few studies exist investigating antagonistic pleiotropy in
certain diseases.
In this study, an evolutionary relationship is hypothesized
between adaptation at extreme environmental conditions
and increased cancer risk in humans. In order to prove this,
reliable and accurate data on cancer incidence worldwide
were needed. The most accurate and complete survey for
global
cancer
incidence,
being
public
available,
is
GLOBOCAN-2012 (Ferlay et al. 2015). GLOBOCAN-2012 per-
mits a variety of incidence/prevalence analysis per country or
per cancer type (http://globocan.iarc.fr/). Additionally, biblio-
graphic cancer incidence and genetic data for human pop-
ulations living at extreme cold and extreme high-altitude plus
240 cancer genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were
analyzed as well. Evidence was found that cancer rates have
been increased in those populations through natural selec-
tion procedures. This is the first study that provides evidence

Results and Discussion
GLOBOCAN-2012, Average Annual Temperature, and
Extreme Low Temperature Analyses
A number of different analyses were performed with
GLOBOCAN-2012 data, according the research hypothesis
of this study. Interestingly, at “all cancers” analysis (excl. non-
melanoma skin cancer) at a descending age-standardized rate
(ASR) order, number two in ranking is Norway and number
eight is Denmark. Indeed, Scandinavian countries, being
among the coldest countries in Earth, rank very high in ASR
rates for many frequent and rare cancer types, like breast
and colorectal cancer (fig. 1 and supplementary table
S1, Supplementary Material online). This can be attributed
to
genetic
background
of
Scandinavian
populations.
Hypothesizing here an evolutionary relationship between ad-
aptation at very cold environments and high cancer inci-
dence, published data for Inuit (Canadian and Greenlandic
native populations) and Athabascans (Native Americans liv-
ing mainly in Alaska), that live at extreme cold, were investi-
gated. These data show that these populations exhibit
extreme high cancer incidence, especially for lung, breast,
and colorectal cancer (Friborg and Melbye 2008; Lemrow
et al. 2008; Day et al. 2010; Moore et al. 2014; Perdue et al.
2014; Foote et al. 2016; Young et al. 2016) (fig. 1C and D). Lung
cancer can be attributed to high rates of smoking in these
populations (Young et al. 2016). These populations are not
part of GLOBOCAN-2012 project.
In order to investigate if temperature–cancer incidence
association is an extended phenomenon in human popula-
tions, linear regression analysis was performed of average an-
nual temperatures (AAT) per country with cancer ASR per
country (184 countries included). Results are shown in
figure 2A and B. ASRs of “all-cancers” (excl. nonmelanoma
skin cancer), breast cancer, and colorectal cancer were found
to be linearly related with AAT. Prediction power of the
model is highly significant (P< 0.0001). In order to visualize
these results, ASRs and AATs were distributed in eight quar-
tiles and then plotted in global maps, presenting each gender
separately (fig. 2A). It is obvious that the ASR pattern follows
the AAT one. Since here it is speculated an extreme environ-
ment—extreme cancer rate relationship, a further statistical
analysis was attempted by comparing ASR means of the
countries belonging to the two 25% AAT extremes (table
1). ASR means of the ten most frequent cancer types were
compared between 45 countries (AAT: �5.1 to 10.6 �C) and
43 countries (AAT: 25.1–28.3 �C) by independent t-test. All
means differ significantly (highest association: lung cancer
P¼ 8.80�10�18, bladder cancer P¼ 3.54�10�14, colorectal
cancer P¼ 7.28�10�13), except ones of liver cancer. On the
contrast, comparison for cervix cancer was significant for the
opposite effect (high AAT—high ASR). Results for cervix can-
cer is quite logical, since this cancer is highly related with
infectious factors (HPV viruses) that thrive in warm countries
and especially in Africa (de Martel et al. 2017).
An additional linear regression analysis was performed,
using this time extreme low temperatures (ELT) data. Since
such data do not exist for all countries (data were found for
86 countries), a linear regression was performed for AAT and
ELT values (fig. 2C). The model is highly linear and predictive,
this showing that ELT values follow closely the AAT ones.
That means that AAT data can be used safely for extracting
conclusions
for
extreme
environmental
conditions.
Additionally, linear regression analyses were performed for
ELT versus ASR/all cancers, ASR/colorectal cancer, and
ASR/breast cancer. Adjusted R2 were smaller than the AAT
ones (this is because less countries were included), but the
models were significant.
GWAS and Populations in Extreme Cold
Environments
Speculating an evolutionary mechanism, genetic results for
population living in extreme cold conditions were collected.
Three lists of genes under selection were adopted from three
evolutionary GWAS, Native Americans (Amorim et al. 2017),
Inuit (Fumagalli et al. 2015), and Siberian Eskimos (Cardona
et al. 2014), all abbreviated as “COLD.” Additionally, 240 can-
cer GWAS (see Materials and Methods for details) were com-
bined to create a reliable list of cancer-associated genes
(CAG). The main aim here was to investigate if genes found
to be under selection for cold environments, predispose for
cancer too. This is coming out by comparing the list of genes
under selection with the CAG one, for any genes in common.
Results are shown in figure 3. Population analysis, one by one,
gives
statistically
significant
results
(P¼ 6.7�10�5,
P¼ 6.7�10�3, P¼ 0.055, respectively). By adding all genes
together from all three populations (overall analysis), signifi-
cance is P¼ 5.9�10�6. By a meta-analysis approach, signifi-
cance is P¼ 1.0�10�4. Part of the significance for Native
Americans and Inuit is derived from a positive signal on chro-
mosomal region 11q12.2, where the genes FADS1 and FADS2
are located. These genes encode for fatty acid desaturases
implicated to lipids metabolism, which is considered a highly
important pathway for northern populations (Fumagalli et al.
2015; Amorim et al. 2017). On the other hand, certain alleles
on these genes have been found to predispose for colorectal
cancer in East Asians (Zhang et al. 2014). This is in accordance
to the fact that Native Americans (Athabascans) and Inuit
have the highest incidence of colorectal cancer in the world
(Young et al. 2016) (fig. 1D).
CAG and Populations in Extreme High-Altitude
Environments
Under the concept of extreme environment—extreme can-
cer risk, human populations adapted at extreme high altitude
were investigated using the same approach as above. These
populations are Amhara and Oromi, the major part of pop-
ulation of Ethiopia, Aymara Indians in Andes (Andeans), and
Tibetans (all three abbreviated as “ALTITUDE”). Are these
populations at extreme cancer risk? Unfortunately not any
analytical cancer incidence data are public available for Tibet
(part of China). Regarding Aymara, the only detailed pub-
lished cancer study is for La-Paz, the highest altitude town

 in the world. La-Paz is inhabited mainly by Aymara Indians.
Data published on 1981 show that Aymara are at extreme risk
for gallbladder and testicular cancer (Rios-Dalenz et al. 1981)
(fig. 1E and F), cancers with significant genetic component
(Mhatre et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2017), and cancers found to
be highly associated with low AAT (table 1). High-altitude
environments are also considered as extreme cold environ-
ments. A recent archeological study revealed that Andes
mountains were inhabited by people much more longer
than previously thought, �8,000years ago (Randall et al.
2017). It is worthy to underline here that Athabascans and
Norwegians are also at extreme risk for testicular cancer
(Norway ranks presently first for testicular cancer according
GLOBOCAN-2012) (fig. 1F). Ethiopia cancer ASR data are in
the same line of research hypothesis. All cancer cases of
Ethiopia that are registered in GLOBOCAN-2012, are coming
from the only cancer center of the capital town, Addis-Abeba.
The major part of patients of this center is of Amhara or
Oromi ethnicity (Abate et al. 2016). Analysis showed that
Ethiopia ranks 6th for breast cancer (fig. 1A) and 12th for
colorectal cancer (data not shown), out of 54 Africa countries.
A number of evolutionary GWAS studies exist for
ALTITUDE populations (Bigham et al. 2010; Simonson et al.
2010; Peng et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2011; Alkorta-Aranburu et al.
2012; Scheinfeldt et al. 2012; Huerta-Sanchez et al. 2013;
Tekola-Ayele et al. 2015; Valverde et al. 2015). All available
GWAS for Amhara and Oromi were combined (Alkorta-
Aranburu et al. 2012; Scheinfeldt et al. 2012; Huerta-
Sanchez et al. 2013). A single study was taken into account
for Andeans-Tibetans (Foll et al. 2014), due to the highly
reliable “convergent evolution” method that was used by
the authors for identifying genes under selection. As in
COLD populations, list of genes under selection were com-
pared for any common genes with CAG list. This analysis gave
a significant result for Oromi (P¼ 0.03), a highly significant
result for Andeans-Tibetans (P¼ 1.3�10�11) and not signif-
icance at all for Amhara (fig. 3). Due to the nonsignificance of
Amhara, meta-analysis of all three ALTITUDE populations
was marginally significant (fig. 3). On the other hand, an over-
all analysis was highly significant (P¼ 1.5�10�7). A possible
cause for the nonsignificance for Amhara is that Ethiopians
are rarely part of cancer GWAS.
Housekeeping Genes versus CAG
In order to increase reliability of the above results, a separate
control experiment was done. A complete list of housekeep-
ing genes was used (Eisenberg and Lavanon 2013) for per-
forming similar comparisons as described earlier for CAG.
FIG. 1. Cancer age-standardized (ASR) data by country and by cancer type. ASR data of 184 populations can be found in supplementary table S1,
Supplementary Material online. Bars of populations of main interest are in red color. Bars showing noticeable data of other populations are in pink
color. For (A), (B), and (C), (D), ASR ranking is indicated by the ranking number before each country/population name. ASR values are according
GLOBOCAN-2012 and Young et al. (2016) (2004–2008 ASR data). Bootstrapping for 1,000 random replications in (C) and (D) shows that the
association of temperature with ASR is highly significant under a Wald v2 statistic. Additionally, in (C) and (D), statistical analysis showed that
when countries/populations were separated in six quartiles according ASR ranking, the first quartile (31 populations in total, asterisk symbolled, 5
of them areshown) hada significantly lower mean ofaverage annualtemperatures when compared with themean ofaverage annual temperatures
of the other five quartiles (P¼5.09�10�8, P¼3.01�10�9, respectively). For (E) and (F), ASR 1978–1979 data were taken from Rios-Dalenz et al.
(1981). In (F), Athabascans’ ASR of testicular cancer is included in the plot according Young et al. (2016), since data show that ASR values are stable
long-term (1989–2008). ASR is termed as “new cases/time period/100,000 individuals.”

 This list (3,800 genes) was first compared for common genes
with CAG. In total, 175 genes out of the 1,377 CAG were
found to be housekeeping genes. This is just a percentage of
12.7% in comparison with the percentage (18.6%) of all
housekeeping genes in the human genome. That means
that
housekeeping
genes
are
underrepresented
(P¼ 5.19�10�8) in the list of CAG, so they can serve as a
separate independent and reliable comparison with genes
under selection for cold and high-altitude. Analysis was per-
formed under the same logic as it was described earlier. This
can be found in table 2. Not any statistical significance came
out after this comparison, that meaning that genes under
selection are not significantly enriched with housekeeping
genes. This result gives an increased confidence to the result
that a significant number of CAG have undergone selection
procedures in the studied populations.
All related gene lists and analyses can be found in supple-
mentary tables S2 and S3, Supplementary Material online.
Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressor Genes
In order to investigate which cancer pathways have been
favored by evolution in COLD and ALTITUDE populations,
a separate analysis was performed for oncogenes and tumor
suppressor genes. A number of 724 protein coding oncogenes
were downloaded from the oncogene database http://
ongene.bioinfo-minzhao.org/ (Liu et al. 2017) and 1,038 pro-
tein coding tumor suppressor genes were downloaded from
the tumor suppressor gene database https://bioinfo.uth.edu/
TSGene/(Zhao et al. 2016). Analysis was performed under the
same way with housekeeping genes and CAG (supplementary
table S4, Supplementary Material online). Interestingly, only
tumor suppressor genes were found to be under selection in
FIG. 2. (A) ASR values of certain cancers and average annual temperatures plotted in Earth maps, aside to linear regression plots. (B) Linear
regression plots, separately for each gender, for colon cancer and for all cancers. (C) Linear regression plots showing i) the high linearity between
average annual temperatures (Celsius degrees) and extreme low temperatures (Celsius degrees) and ii) significant correlation between cancer ASR
values and extreme low temperatures. ASR values were plotted by ascending order of eight quartiles (the darker the color the higher the incidence,
quartiles can be found in supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). Greenland was included in the maps according cancer ASRs
reported by Young et al. (2016). Average annual temperatures were plotted according an inverse ascending order (the darker the color the lower
the temperature) of eight quartiles. Only countries reported by GLOBOCAN-2012 were included to linear regression analyses. Adjusted R2 is above
of each regression plot (both gender included for “all cancers” and “colorectal cancer” plots). Prediction probability is highly significant for all
regression analyses.

 COLD (P¼ 1.2�10�2) and ALTITUDE (P¼ 1.3�10�5) pop-
ulations (table 3). Significance is somewhat lower than the
CAG one, since now the analysis was split in two cancer genes
categories and due to the fact that the CAG list contains
genes that have not yet been categorized as oncogenes or
tumor suppressor genes. On the other hand, risk ratios show
clearly the overrepresentation of tumor suppressor genes
(compared with oncogenes) in genes under selection
(fig. 4). The fact that there is a preferential selection for tumor
suppressor genes is very important, showing a potential sur-
vival advantage for organisms living in very cold and high-
altitude environments. Such an advantage can be apoptosis
resistance, to escape cell death under extreme environmental
conditions. In addition, this mechanism has been proved
through functional studies by other research teams (see
below).
Analysis by DAVIDv.6.8 Software
Aiming at further confirmation of the described results, the
online software DAVIDv.6.8 was used to analyze gene lists
under selection of COLD and ALTITUDE populations.

Database (GAD) and P values are provided for genes that

Analytical disease output is found in table 4 and supplemen-
tary table S5, Supplementary Material online. Cancer findings
are in accordance with the previously presented results:
Colorectal cancer for Natives Americans, Colorectal cancer/
Esophageal cancer/Lung cancer for Siberian Eskimos, not any
association for Amhara (as before), leukemia for Oromi, and a
variety of cancers for Andeans–Tibetans. Justification of these
results: 1) Natives Americans rank first together with Inuit for
colorectal cancer incidence (fig. 1D); 2) esophageal cancer and
Lung cancer are indeed major cancer types for Siberian
Eskimos (Zaridze et al. 1993); 3) regarding Amhara and
Oromi, Ethiopia ranks third in Africa for leukemia, according
GLOBOCAN-2012 (fig. 1B); and 4) due to limited data for
cancer incidence in Andeans–Tibetans, results for this data
set are difficult to be interpreted.
Role of Apoptosis Genes and DNA Repair Genes at
Extreme Environmental Conditions
It is useful to discuss here that the most frequent BRCA1
mutation worldwide (founder mutation) has been found in
Greenlandic Inuit population (Harboe et al. 2009). This maybe
a coincidence, but evolutionary forces could be hypothesized
as well. Additionally, variants in EGLN1 gene, one of the most
important genes under selection in high altitude (Bigham
et al. 2010; Simonson et al. 2010; Yi et al. 2010; Lorenzo
et al. 2014; Bigham 2016; Peng et al. 2017; Tashi et al. 2017),
have been recently associated with lung cancer in Tibetans
(Lanikova et al. 2017). The last study is a direct connection of
a gene under selection with cancer susceptibility, in a high-
altitude population.
Colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and leukemia, are cancers
that are closely related with apoptosis and DNA repair

 procedures (Jeggo et al. 2016). It is well known for unicellular
organisms (bacteria, protozoans, and fungi), that randomly
appeared mutations in DNA repair genes can convert them
in “mutator” strains (LeClerc et al. 1996; Notley-McRobb et al.
2002; Lujan et al. 2011; Byrne et al. 2014; Bui et al. 2015;
Grazielle-Silva et al. 2015; Healey et al. 2016). These strains
are resistant in a variety of adverse environments. Same genes
cause colorectal or breast cancer in humans (Jeggo et al. 2016)
(table 5). In addition, published evidence shows that reduced
apoptosis potential (certain alleles in TP53 gene) helps mam-
mals to survive in cold and high-altitude environments
(Ashur-Fabian et al. 2004; Zhao et al. 2013) (table 5).
Interestingly, two mammals living at the Tibet plateau,
Myospalax baileyi and Microtus oeconomus, have a certain
amino acid in their p53 protein at the same position where
a germ-line mutation was reported in a patient with multiple
primary cancers. The authors (Zhao et al. 2013) found evi-
dence that this amino acid in those two mammals is needed
for divergent responses of IGFBP3 and Apaf1 to hypoxia and
cold stresses. Ashur-Fabian et al. (2004) found similar evi-
dence for a certain amino acid position in Spalax, contribut-
ing to hypoxia adaptation of this mammal. This amino acid is
found in a highly conserved DNA-binding domain of TP53
(fig. 5) that it is a hotspot in cancer mutagenesis. This amino
acid is reported to be affected in 57 different human tumors
of various types (Ashur-Fabian et al. 2004). Results of those

 two studies were combined and are presented in figure 5.
It is obvious, that these studies can be considered as direct
functional justification of the results presented here.
Additionally, these data are in perfect match with the
finding that that tumor suppressor genes are under
selection in COLD and ALTITUDE human populations.
It is useful to remind that many cancers that rank high
in COLD and ALTITUDE populations, are related with
tumor suppressor genes. Gene Ontology analysis with
DAVIDv.6.8 for genes under selection in COLD and
ALTITUDE populations (presented in supplementary ta-
ble S5, Supplementary Material online), revealed certain
cell cycle and apoptosis biological procedures (BP) in
Native Americans, Amhara, and Andeans-Tibetans.
Conclusion
Concluding, findings of this study provide evidence that
genetic variants found to be beneficial in extreme envi-
ronments, can also predispose for cancer. This can be
considered as an antagonistic pleiotropy phenomenon.
Cell resistance at low temperatures and high altitude, it
probably increases probability for malignancy. This effect
hardly could be filtered out by natural selection since
most cancers appear late on age, after most people
have their children. It is also tempting to hypothesize
that similar events of the past, contributed to rise of can-
cer rates in all human populations today. Future research
may clear this out.

 AAT by country (years 1961–1990) are based on gridded
climatologies from the Climatic Research Unit (http://www.
cru.uea.ac.uk/). Extreme low-temperature data for 86 coun-
tries were retrieved from Arizona State University climate
extremes archive (https://wmo.asu.edu/) and from reliable
sources that are referred in List of weather records (https://
en.wikipedia.org/).
GLOBOCAN-2012, AAT, and ELT data are listed in supple-
mentary table S1, Supplementary Material online. ASR is
termed “new cases/time period/100,000 individuals.” ASR
data of GLOBOCAN-2012 are recorded for year 2012.
Cancer Genes’ Data Set
NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog (MacArthur et al. 2017) (https://
www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) was used for downloading all genes
that have been associated with cancer through GWAS studies
(supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online)
since May of 2017. NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog is a continu-
ously updating GWAS database. Keyword “cancer” and ge-
netic association with P� 5�10�8 were used as filtering
criteria for retrieving all GWAS cancer association studies
that are archived in NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog. Totally 240
GWAS studies were included for analysis (supplementary ta-
ble S2, Supplementary Material online). All cancer association
studies were downloaded except cervix cancer, due to its high
correlation with infectious factors. GWAS for drug response
and disease progression were excluded too. In order to create
a “CAG” list, genes termed as “mapped” or “reported” by the
NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog, were included for listing. Genes in
duplicate (same in different studies) were excluded in order

Nonprotein coding genes “MIR” and “LINC” and genes of
uncertain importance or existence (“LOC”) were not taken
into account for the statistical analysis. Despite this, readers

A separate analysis was performed for protein coding
oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Oncogenes list was
downloaded from oncogene database (Liu et al. 2017), http://
ongene.bioinfo-minzhao.org/, and tumor suppressor genes
were downloaded from tumor suppressor gene database
(Zhao et al. 2016), https://bioinfo.uth.edu/TSGene/. All re-
lated analyses can be found in supplementary table S4,
Supplementary Material online.
Housekeeping Genes
A separate analysis was performed with housekeeping genes,
serving as a control experiment. Housekeeping genes’ list was
adapted by Eisenberg and Lavanon (2013). This list (3,800
genes) is based on analysis of next-generation sequencing
(RNA-seq) data. As the authors state, at least one variant of
these genes is expressed in all tissues uniformly. Analysis was
performed by comparing this list for any common genes with
genes under selection, under the same logic that it is de-
scribed below. The housekeeping genes’ list and all compar-
isons performed can be found in supplementary table S3,
Supplementary Material online.
Genes under Selection in Extreme Cold and High-
Altitude Environments
A number of GWAS exist, indicating genes under selection for
populations living at extreme cold and high-altitude environ-
ments. These populations are: Inuit (cold), Eskimos (cold),
Native Americans (cold), Tibetans (high-altitude), Andeans
(high-altitude), and Ethiopians (high-altitude). For creating
lists of genes under selection (supplementary table S2,
Supplementary Material online) for extreme cold and high-
altitude populations, seven GWAS studies were taken into
account, as justified below.
Data and studies that were analyzed for “COLD” group of
populations are: 1) First Americans (Native American popu-
lations living or their close ancestors used to live at extreme
cold environments): Table S2 of genes of Amorim et al.
(2017), 2) Greenlandic Inuit: Table S2 of genes of Fumagalli
et al. (2015), and 3) Siberian Eskimos: Table S6 of genes (only
those being in 0.1% of PBS values) of Cardona et al. (2014).
Data and studies that were analyzed for the “ALTITUDE”
group of populations are: 1) Amhara population (Ethiopians
living in high altitude): Table S7 of genes of Scheinfeldt et al.
(2012), Table S23 of genes of Alkorta-Aranburu et al. (2012),
and Table S4 of genes of Huerta-Sanchez et al. (2013), 2)
Oromi population (Ethiopians living in high altitude): Table
S24 of genes of Alkorta-Aranburu et al. (2012), and Table S5 of
genes of Huerta-Sanchez et al. (2013), and 3) Andeans and
Tibetans: Table S1 of genes of Foll et al. (2014). The last study
was considered as the most reliable for Andeans and Tibetans
since a convergent evolution model of analysis was taken into
account, giving results of high confidence.
Every
excel
sheet
of
supplementary
table
S2,
Supplementary Material online, contains the CAG list, created
by combining all GWAS studies, the list of genes under selec-
tion of each study or population and the ENSG code of each
gene under selection. CAG list contains 1,377 genes.
Comparison of the CAG list with each list of selected genes
was performed though the “duplicate” function of Microsoft
Excel 2016 and genes in common are highlighted. The same
approach has been followed for housekeeping genes, onco-
genes, and tumor suppressor genes.
Statistical approach is a 2�2 table: CAG (1,377) out of all
genes (Howe et al. 2013) of human genome (20,479) versus
(n) cancer genes found in (z) genes under selection.
Statistical Analysis and Multiple Alignment
All statistical analysis needed for this work was performed
though the statistical package STATAv.13 (StataCorp LLC,
TX). Basic statistical analysis included univariate linear regres-
sion, Pearson v2 for 2�2 tables, Fisher’s exact test for 2�2
tables including counts <10, independent t-test (two-tailed),
quartile analysis, and bar plots for cancer ASR presentation of
various populations. Significant level alpha was set to 0.05.
Meta-analysis was performed through the DerSimonian
and Laird random effects method in STATAv.13, using the
metan algorithm according to Harris et al. (2008).
Software DAVIDv6.8 (Huang da et al. 2009a, b) was applied
for analyzing gene lists under selection (supplementary table
S2, Supplementary Material online). Analysis done by
DAVIDv6.8: 1) association with diseases registered in GAD-
Genetic Association Database (supplementary table S5,
Supplementary Material online) and 2) analysis for any signif-
icance with biological procedures (BP) according Gene
Ontology (GO) mappings (directly annotated by the source
database) (supplementary table S5, Supplementary Material
online).
Paintmaps, a free online map generating tool (http://www.
paintmaps.com/) was used for creating global grading Earth
maps according AAT and ASR quartile data.
Multiple alignment for TP53 was performed through the
CLC Main Workbench 7 software (Qiagen, Aarchus,
Denmark).
