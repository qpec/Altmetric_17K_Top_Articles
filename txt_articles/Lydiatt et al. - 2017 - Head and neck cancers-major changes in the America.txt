ABSTRACT: The recently released eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual, Head and Neck Section, introduces significant modifi-
cations from the prior seventh edition. This article details several of the most signifi-
cant modifications, and the rationale for the revisions, to alert the reader to evolution
of the field. The most significant update creates a separate staging algorithm for high-
risk human papillomavirus-associated cancer of the oropharynx, distinguishing it from
oropharyngeal cancer with other causes. Other modifications include: the reorganizing
of skin cancer (other than melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma) from a general chap-
ter for the entire body to a head and neck-specific cutaneous malignancies chapter;
division of cancer of the pharynx into 3 separate chapters; changes to the tumor (T)
categories for oral cavity, skin, and nasopharynx; and the addition of extranodal can-
cer extension to lymph node category (N) in all but the viral-related cancers and muco-
sal melanoma. The Head and Neck Task Force worked with colleagues around the
world to derive a staging system that reflects ongoing changes in head and neck
oncology; it remains user friendly and consistent with the traditional tumor, lymph
node, metastasis (TNM) staging paradigm. CA Cancer J Clin 2017;67:122-137.

Practical Implications for Continuing Education
> The 8th Edition staging of HR-HPV associated cancer of the oropharynx will give
a much more accurate and reasonable prediction of survival for newly
diagnosed patients. For example, a patient that presents with a 2 centimeter,
p161 tonsil cancer and 2 positive lymph nodes in the same side neck is stage
IV in the 7th Edition Staging Manual but will become a stage I in the 8th Edition.
The psychological benefit of having a stage I versus a stage IV cancer is
significant and clinicians can much more readily reassure patients that they
have a good prognosis.
> The most significant pathological finding in a positive lymph node is whether it
extends outside the capsule (ENE). This will now be an important aspect of
staging of non-p161, non-EBER1 cancers of the head and neck.
> Including depth of invasion in oral cavity will better discriminate the higher risk
small cancers as demonstrated by deeply invasive tumors from those with less
invasive cancers that have an excellent prognosis.
Introduction
Assigning the proper clinical and pathological stage is one of the key activities for
clinicians caring for those afflicted with cancer. Staging entails stratification into

 similar groups based on anatomic and nonanatomic criteria
to assist in estimating prognosis and planning treatment.
Head and neck oncology encompasses a group of malig-
nancies that arise in the mucosal surfaces of the upper aero-
digestive tract (UADT), including the oral cavity, pharynx,
larynx, and paranasal sinuses, as well as cancers of the major
and minor salivary glands. As such, the staging of malig-
nancies arising in the UADT was defined in the American
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual, sev-
enth edition, in the chapters pertaining to head and neck
cancer.1
Skin cancer other than melanoma and Merkel cell carci-
noma, when staged, has traditionally been addressed using
the
AJCC
tumor,
lymph
node,
metastasis
(TNM)
approach.1 However, in practice, clinicians tended not to
stage the overwhelming majority of small cancers treated
with curettage or cryoablation. Therefore, the Cutaneous
Malignancy Task Force of the AJCC recommended elimi-
nating the chapter on nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC)
from the eighth edition. Because a majority of skin cancers
occur in the head and neck, where they can be of significant
importance because of competing goals of cancer control
and survival versus function and esthetic preservation, the
Head and Neck Committee on Staging recommended (and
the AJCC leadership agreed to) incorporating skin cancer
staging (other than melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma,
which continue to be staged in unique chapters) within the
chapters devoted specifically to the head and neck.2 Hence,
the head and neck section addresses NMSCs of the head
and neck as well as those malignancies that arise from the
mucosal surfaces of the UADT and salivary glands.2 Thy-
roid cancers are part of a separate section in the AJCC
Cancer Staging Manual, eighth edition.2
Recognizing the prognostic power of newly validated
pathologic features of some primary tumors and of cervical
lymph
node
metastases, and
differentiating
high-risk
human papilloma virus (HR-HPV)-associated oropharyn-
geal cancer (OPC) from OPC with other causes, the AJCC
Cancer Staging Manual, eighth edition head and neck
chapters introduce significant changes from the seventh
edition.1,2 A new chapter describes the staging of HR-
HPV–associated OPC. In addition, a separate chapter for
non-HPV–associated OPC and hypopharyngeal cancer and
one for nasopharyngeal cancer are included; therefore, pha-
ryngeal cancers are staged in 3 independent chapters. In
addition to incorporating the head and neck-specific cuta-
neous malignancies chapter, other modifications include:
changes to the T categories in nasopharynx, oral cavity, and
skin; alteration in the N category in nasopharynx; and the
addition of extranodal extension (ENE) by tumor in a met-
astatic lymph node (N category). This review highlights
and
explains
the
importance
of
the
major
changes
introduced with publication of the eighth edition of the
AJCC Cancer Staging Manual in the Fall of 2016.2
Background on the AJCC Head and Neck Task
Force
The AJCC Head and Neck Task Force consisted of 28 spe-
cialists selected for their breadth of expertise and depth of
knowledge in staging and head and neck cancer biology.
This group was guided by the desired tenets for a proper
staging system as described by Groome et al.3 Stratification
should result in similar survival for each subgroup (hazard
consistency). Each subgroup should have different survival
from the one above or below (hazard discrimination). There
should be relatively equal numbers of subjects in each group
to facilitate statistical analysis (balance between groups). The
assigned stage should give a good approximation of survival
for the individual patient (high predictive ability).3 These
principles served as guides for determining which aspects of
the staging system warranted modification and which
should remain unchanged. A comprehensive analysis of
each of the chapters, undertaken by subgroups of experts,
led to recommendations that were submitted for approval
and comment to the full task force. When changes were
advised by the task force, additional analyses were per-
formed to determine whether the available data would sup-
port the revision. This iterative process led to the changes
introduced in the eighth edition.
While personalized nomogram approaches hold promise,
the pretreatment assessment of patients using the time-
tested TNM framework remains applicable worldwide in
diverse medical settings and is relevant to all patients.4 For
evaluating the impact of treatment across populations and
time, the revisions in the eighth edition represent a compro-
mise between an accurate but highly complex system (but
potentially low compliance) and a simpler, high-compliance
system with somewhat diminished predictive capacity.
Cancer Staging Considerations for the Eighth
Edition
Cancer staging is an important component of patient care
across the world. Preserving universal ability to stage can-
cers, regardless of a country’s level of resources, and scrupu-
lously assuring harmony between the AJCC and Union for
International Cancer Control (UICC) staging systems
were crucial goals. Balancing the demand to maintain con-
sistency across past versions of the staging system with the
need for innovation and contemporary applicability were
important requirements. In this endeavor, members of the
UICC and AJCC Head and Neck Committees were linked
by a sense of collegiality and unity of purpose. Both groups
strove to balance global applicability with the need for
incremental improvement. The committees held numerous

 teleconferences and e-mail exchanges to solicit worldwide
participation, ultimately adopting recommendations that
represented compromises all could support.
The nature and type of treatment determines the variety
and quality of data available for use in prognostication and
staging. For head and neck cancers that are largely treated
using nonsurgical modalities (eg, nasopharyngeal cancer),
pathological staging data, such as the number of involved
lymph nodes or microscopic ENE, are seldom available;
therefore, such diseases are staged using only the clinical
TNM (cTNM) system. Cancers that are usually treated
surgically (eg, oral cavity cancer [OCC]) provide robust
pathological and clinical staging information; therefore,
separate cTNM and pathological TNM (pTNM) systems
are described for these situations.
Changes to Staging in HR-HPV–Associated
OPCs
Since 1990, the incidence of cancers of the tonsil and tongue
base associated with HR-HPV has risen at an alarming 5%
per year in the United States and elsewhere.5-7 HPV types
16 and 18 are the most commonly detected, transcriptionally
active HR-HPV types in head and neck cancer.7 Demo-
graphically, HR-HPV–associated OPC represents a novel
disease that occurs more often in younger, healthier individ-
uals with little or no tobacco exposure.5 The entity is highly
responsive to treatment and carries an excellent prognosis.
While the seventh edition TNM staging of OPC adequately
reflects the behavior of those cancers typically associated
with tobacco and alcohol abuse (not caused by HR-HPV), it
does not properly describe HR-HPV disease with respect to
prognosis or behavior.1,7,8 As the number of OPCs caused
by HPV rose, the seventh edition staging algorithm lost the
ability to differentiate between stages (hazard discrimination),
and the numerical balance was skewed toward stage III and
IV, reducing the predictive features of any specific stage.
Therefore, a new staging system was needed for HR-HPV
OPC.
Because site or histology alone cannot differentiate the 2
entities, it was imperative to identify an accurate or charac-
teristic test to distinguish the 2 types of OPC. The test
should be simple, inexpensive, and reproducible. One
option was to consider tobacco exposure versus no tobacco
exposure to define the 2 types of oropharynx disease. How-
ever, tobacco use is found among patients with HR-HPV–
associated tumors, and non HR-HPV–associated tumors
emerge in nontobacco users (yet behave like classical
tobacco-associated tumors). Hence, tobacco exposure fails as
a differentiating characteristic. Direct HR-HPV detection
can be performed on tissue samples by in situ hybridization
(ISH), but it is expensive and is not universally available,
rendering ISH suboptimal for worldwide adoption. In many
institutions, HPV-ISH is “sent-out,” which increases turn-
around time. Immunohistochemistry for overexpression
of the tumor suppressor protein p16 (cyclin-dependent
kinase 2A) is an established, robust surrogate biomarker for
HPV-mediated carcinogenesis; it is also an independent pos-
itive prognosticator in the context of OPC.8-10 Immunohis-
tochemical staining for p16 is inexpensive, has near universal
availability, and is relatively straightforward to interpret.
Hence, OPCs are now staged according to 2 distinct sys-
tems, depending on whether or not they overexpress p16.2
Staging by the HR-HPV–associated OPC system should
only be assigned when p16 overexpression is determined
using established criteria.11-13 Specifically, the cutoff point
for p16 overexpression is diffuse (�75%) tumor expression,
with at least moderate (12/3) staining intensity. This coin-
cides with the usual staining pattern seen in HR-HPV–
associated OPC. Overexpression of p16 is usually localized
to tumor cell nuclei and cytoplasm, and p16 staining local-
ized only to the cytoplasm is considered nonspecific and thus
not diagnostic (negative).
In the seventh edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Man-
ual, the pharynx chapter addressed cancers arising in the
nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx.1 To reflect the
very different biological and etiological differences between
nasopharyngeal carcinoma, HR-HPV–associated OPC and
non-HPV–associated OPC, and hypopharyngeal cancer, the
eighth edition staging manual has been divided into 3 sepa-
rate chapters—nasopharynx, HR-HPV–associated (p16-pos-
itive) OPC, and hypopharynx and non-HR-HPV–associated
(p16-negative) OPC—to better reflect the variety of diseases
arising in the pharynx.
T categories in both p16-positive, HR-HPV–associated
OPC and p16-negative, non-HR-HPV–associated OPC
were equally valid from a prognostic standpoint and thus
remain the same with 2 exceptions: the p16-positive classi-
fication includes no carcinoma in situ (Tis) (because of the
nonaggressive pattern of invasive of p16-positive OPC and
the lack of a distinct basement membrane in the epithelium
of Waldeyer ring), and the T4b category has been removed
from p16-positive OPC (because the curves of the T4a and
T4b categories proved indistinguishable) (Tables 1 and 2).2
p16-Negative cancers of the oropharynx, like other non-
HR-HPV–associated cancers in the head and neck, such as
those of the oral cavity, larynx, hypopharynx, and paranasal
sinus, will no longer include a T0 category. The rationale
for the change is elucidated below (see Unknown Primary).
A variety of treatment approaches for p16-positive, HR-
HPV–associated OPC are currently used. The National
Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines consider radiation-
based or surgically based treatment equally acceptable as first-
line therapy.14 The data that led to the need for a new staging
system and the data to create and validate the staging systems
CA CANCER J CLIN 2017;67:122–137
VOLUME 67 _ NUMBER 2 _ MARCH/APRIL 2017
125
 were broad based and came from centers treating primarily with
radiation or primarily with surgical resection as the initial, defin-
itive form of therapy.15-18 In view of the rising frequency of
p16-positive oropharynx cancer, the urgency to define staging
criteria necessitated use of data from both published and unpub-
lished sources. Therefore, access to large data bases for validation
was obtained with the approval of the multi-institutional con-
sortia but before their publication.17,18
The p16-positive, HR-HPV–associated OPC cTNM
classification is applicable to all patients before treatment
(regardless of the intended form of treatment). cTNM
employs information from physical examination and what-
ever imaging is performed. Clinically involved lymph
nodes, whether one or multiple, as long as they were ipsilat-
eral and less than 6 cm in size, had similar impact on sur-
vival (similar hazard consistency) and thus are included in
the same N category: N1. Survival with clinically palpable
and/or radiographically evident, bilateral or contralateral
lymph nodes was distinguishable with a worse outcome
than N1. Therefore, contralateral or bilateral lymph nodes
are classified as N2. Lymph nodes greater than 6 cm
foretold the worst survival from regional disease and thus
warranted the highest N category: N3. This represents a
significant change from the non-HR-HPV–associated
(p16-negative) OPC N category (Tables 3 and 4).2
pTNM is obviously applicable only to patients who are
managed with surgery (after examination of the resected
specimens, like all other pathologically staged tumors).
Neither lymph node size (lymph nodes >6 cm in greatest
dimension did not confer any difference in survival from a
smaller, single lymph node) nor presence in the contralater-
al neck was predictive of survival, unlike the situation for
lymph nodes treated with radiation. However, a fundamen-
tal difference in outcome was observed based on the num-
ber of pathologically positive lymph nodes. The breakpoint
in behavior appeared at 1 to 4 (N1) versus 5 or more (N2)
lymph nodes (Table 5).2 Because accurately counting the
number of involved lymph nodes preoperatively is not pos-
sible for a pretreatment clinical stage classification, and
because these data were exclusively derived by analyzing
pathological
lymph
node
numbers,
this
classification
approach will be confined to pTNM. Therefore, the eighth
edition for p16-positive tumors will have 2 separate staging
systems, one for cTNM and one for pTNM. The unusual
difference in behavior seen in the N3 neck between the
clinical and pathological data sets (reflecting radiation
treatment rather than surgical lymph node dissection) is
unexpected. Prospective data collection will be needed to
resolve this issue.
Combining T and N into stage groupings was then
accomplished using both the clinical and pathological
data sets described above (Tables 6, 7, and 8). The signif-
icantly
better
overall
survival
seen
in
HR-HPV–
associated OPC allowed for much clearer discrimination
into 3 curves representing stages I, II, and III. The para-
digm reserves stage IV for patients with distant metastat-
ic disease, a group known to have a much poorer survival.
This represents a sharp contrast with non-HR-HPV–
associated (p16-negative) cancers of the oropharynx,

salivary gland, in which stage IV is subdivided into IVA,
IVB and IVC, and IVC is reserved for distant metastatic
disease (Tables 6, 7, and 8).
Unknown Primary
Squamous cell carcinoma in lymph nodes arising from an
undetected primary cancer is a well recognized clinical enti-
ty in the head and neck. The typical presenting finding is of
an enlarged cervical lymph node with carcinoma identified
by biopsy. A search through history, physical examination,
appropriate imaging, and biopsy of candidate sites must
yield no evidence of a primary tumor. These patients are
categorized as T0 but cannot be assigned to a specific ana-
tomic site. Currently, greater than 90% of these T0
(unknown primary) designations (lymph nodes in patients
with no detectable primary) reflect HR-HPV–associated
cancers.19,20 A large majority of nasopharyngeal cancers are
positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) by Epstein-Barr–
encoded RNA (EBER) on ISH.21 Consequently, in the
proper clinical context, demonstrating the presence of
either EBV or HPV can establish an anatomic site of ori-
gin.19,21
HPV-ISH,
p16
immunohistochemistry,
and
EBER-ISH are recommended for all cervical lymph nodes
with carcinoma of unknown primary site. Thus, one key
change from prior editions of the TNM system is the
elimination of the T0 category in sites other than the naso-
pharynx, HR-HPV–associated OPC, and salivary gland
cancers (which can be identified by their unique histology).
If no primary lesion can be identified, then the lymph node
may have emanated from any mucosal site, so there is no
rationale to support retaining the T0 designation outside of
the virally associated cancers of the oropharynx and naso-
pharynx. The specificity of p16 overexpression alone as a
surrogate
HR-HPV
biomarker
is
limited
to
OPC.
Occasionally, cancers from other sites may express p16,
potentially giving rise to such a lymph node. Therefore, in
the context of assigning a primary anatomic site, HPV-
ISH is also recommended as additional confirmatory test-
ing to attribute the lymph node to a p16-positive

HR-HPV ISH-positive/p16-positive with no primary tumor
identified through history, physical examination, or available
imaging studies will be staged as p16-positive, HR-HPV–
associated OPC, which includes a T0 category. EBV-positive
cancers identified in a cervical lymph node with no detected
primary tumor will be staged according to the nasopharynx
classification in which the T0 category remains. Squamous
carcinoma in a cervical lymph node that is negative for EBER
and p16 cannot be assigned to any specific head and neck pri-
mary site and will be staged according to the system detailed
in the cervical node and unknown primary chapter.
Changes to the T Category
Primary tumor (T) categories (for size/extent of the prima-
ry tumor) have been revised in OCC, NMSC, and naso-
pharyngeal cancer. The T category for OCC acknowledges
the different biological behavior of deeply invasive but
small tumors and incorporates depth of invasion (DOI). It
has been recognized for decades that the prognosis of OCC
worsens when the tumor is thicker.22 More recent data sug-
gest that DOI is a better predictive parameter than tumor
thickness.23 Starting in the sixth edition of the staging
manual, DOI has been recorded and is available for analysis.24
DOI is distinct from tumor thickness, and the ambiguity in
definition has undermined the accuracy of registry-level data.
The precise definition of DOI has been clarified in the eighth
edition, as described below. Assessing DOI by clinical

 examination requires palpation and attention to detail. Clini-
cians will need to distinguish a thick, exophytic, but less inva-
sive tumor from one that is ulcerated and deeply invasive
through careful palpation supplemented by radiographic
assessment. Since the inception of the TNM system, clini-
cians have been using physical examination to reflect subtle
differences in size and extension of tumors, so distinguishing
less invasive lesions (�5 mm), from those of moderate depth
(from >5 to �10 mm) or deeply invasive cancers (>10 mm)
should not be problematic. DOI will affect T category, accen-
tuating the distinction between superficial or exophytic
tumors and those that are more invasive. Staging will no lon-
ger depend solely upon greatest surface dimension (Table 9).2
Because data reported from a large international collaborative
study of OCC demonstrated a significant distinction in out-
comes between T1 tumors with more than 5 mm DOI and
T2 through T4 tumors with greater than 10 mm DOI, the T
category for OCC is being modified in the eighth edition to
improve hazard discrimination.25 Therefore, for every 5-mm
increase in DOI, both cT and pT categories will increase one
level according to the following: �5 mm, >5 mm but �10
mm, and >10 mm. Pathologically, DOI is measured from
the level of the basement membrane of the closest adjacent
normal mucosa. A “plumb line” is dropped from this plane to
the deepest point of tumor invasion. The T category increases
with every interval of 5 mm (Figs. 1, 2, and 3). The tumor
illustrated in Figure 1 is now upstaged to T2 based on a DOI
of 9 mm. Figure 2 demonstrates a small, exophytic cancer;

 DOI is less than tumor thickness in this example. Finally,
Figure 3 shows a small, ulcerated carcinoma, which was
upstaged to T2 based on a DOI of 6 mm. Tumor thickness
underestimates aggressive potential; DOI is superior to tumor
thickness. Generous preoperative biopsies of small tumors
may interfere with DOI determination; therefore, it is impor-
tant that, when pathologists examine the original biopsies,
attention should be directed to DOI to incorporate all avail-
able information and to arrive at the most accurate DOI. As
with staging of all sorts, the general TNM principle of select-
ing the less advanced attribute (in this case, the lesser DOI
categorization) should always be observed when the clinician
harbors doubt. Extrinsic muscle infiltration is no longer a
staging criterion for T4 designation in OCC, because DOI
supersedes it, and limited extrinsic muscle invasion is difficult
to assess (either clinically or pathologically).
As mentioned above, NMSC will be staged with the
head and neck chapters in the eighth edition. NMSC
includes many types of skin malignancies but is largely
composed of basal cell carcinoma and cutaneous squamous
cell carcinoma. Regardless of their anatomic site of origin,
Merkel cell cancer and melanoma continue to be repre-
sented by their own distinct chapters in the eighth edition.
Most of the staging criteria remain the same as those in the
seventh edition, with the exception of the addition of DOI
beyond 6 mm and perineural invasion (PNI) as components
of the T category, both of which elevate a lesion as T3,
even if the tumor is of limited diameter. Furthermore, a

 size criterion is reintroduced, as was previously the case in
the sixth edition TNM classification, but with a cutoff
point greater than 4 cm (as opposed to 5 cm) to distinguish
T3 from T2 lesions, analogous to the size designations in
other head and neck cancers.2,24 Similar to OCC, DOI has
been shown to have a 6.0-fold higher risk of local recur-
rence and lymph node metastasis on multivariate analy-
sis.26,27 PNI of larger nerves has also been shown to
increase the risk of recurrence and metastasis.28,29 The data
for nerves <0.1 mm were less robust;30 therefore, >6 mm
DOI and PNI in large-caliber nerves (�0.1 mm) are con-
sidered T3.
There are 2 changes in nasopharynx T classifications
relating to anatomic markers rather than DOI. The previ-
ous T4 criteria “masticator space” and “infratemporal
fossa” were used as synonyms, but their anatomic descrip-
tions differ, sowing confusion among clinicians. These
terms will now be replaced by a specific description of
soft-tissue involvement to avoid ambiguity. In addition,
adjacent muscle involvement (including medial pterygoid,
lateral pterygoid, and prevertebral muscles) will now be
“down-staged” to T2 based on a recent analysis showing
them to have a more favorable outcome using current
treatment.31

ENE in N Categorization
The status of the regional lymph nodes in head and neck
cancer has tremendous prognostic significance, so the cervi-
cal lymph nodes must be assessed for each patient. ENE has
been added as a prognostic variable for regional lymph node
metastases in addition to the number and size of metastatic
lymph nodes (Tables 4 and 10).2 Evidence has existed for
decades that ENE profoundly affects prognosis for head and
neck cancers, with the recently recognized exception of p16-
positive, HR-HPV–associated OPC.16,32-35 The risk that
newer staging versions would move those patients who had
cancers with a worse outcome into more advanced stages,
thus artificially creating better outcomes in early stage disease
(a concept known as stage migration), was balanced against
the need for better hazard discrimination and consistency.
To minimize stage migration, incorporating ENE into the
clinical staging system requires a high bar for inclusion. Cur-
rent imaging modalities have significant limitations and lack
sensitivity and specificity in their ability to identify early or
minor ENE.36 Radiological evidence alone may be support-
ive but is not sufficient. Therefore, for clinical staging, only
unambiguous ENE, as determined by physical examination
(eg, invasion of skin, infiltration of musculature/dense teth-
ering to adjacent structures, or dysfunction of a cranial nerve,
the brachial plexus, the sympathetic trunk, or the phrenic
nerve) and supported by radiological evidence, should be
present to assign a status of ENE-positive.
Pathological ENE is defined as extension of metastatic
carcinoma from within a lymph node through the fibrous
capsule and into the surrounding connective tissue, regard-
less of the presence of stromal reaction. Metastatic carcino-
ma that stretches the capsule but does not breach it does not
constitute ENE (Fig. 4A and 4B). An additional feature of
ENE that will be collected is minor or major extension.
Pathologically, minor ENE (ENEmi) is defined as extension
�2 mm from the capsule. Major ENE (ENEma) is defined
as either extension apparent to the pathologist’s naked eye
and feel when accessioning the surgical specimen or >2 mm

also includes deposits of carcinoma in soft tissues without
attendant nodal architecture. The 2 subcategories for ENE
are for data collection purposes only, and either is considered
ENE-positive for definition of pN.
Validation of Staging Algorithms Using an Oral
Cavity Data Set
OCC is largely a surgically treated disease. Therefore,
ample histopathologic data from relatively large data sets
are available. Most OCC, like cancers of the larynx, hypo-
pharynx, and paranasal sinuses, are HR-HPV–negative or,
when positive, tend to behave similarly to their negative
counterparts. Consistent with seventh edition staging for
oral cavity, larynx, paranasal sinus, and hypopharynx and
adopting the premise that nonvirus-associated tumors tend
to behave in a similar fashion, the N categorization for all
sites has been changed based upon the data from oral cavity
sites. OCC outcomes were analyzed using a large data set
of patients (treated at 2 tertiary care cancer centers in North
America) approached with a common staging and treat-
ment strategy (Table 11).2 Comparable cancer registry data
sets for sites other than the oral cavity are not available;
therefore, the eighth edition revisions have been based on
single-institutional data that have not yet been validated in
broader registry data sets. The following is a description of
the process of stage revision undertaken for oral cancer to
illustrate how the modifications previously discussed using
DOI and ENE were assessed.
The influence on overall survival upon incorporation of
DOI into the eighth edition oral cavity staging was interro-
gated in the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center-
Princess Margaret Hospital (MSKCC-PMH) institutional
data set (Fig. 6). The addition of ENE to the N category
was performed on a data set of patients with OCC from
the NCDB, including patients who were treated in 2010
and 2011 (Fig. 7A). The data on ENE from other sites also
have been widely published in institutional data sets and
also were examined using the NCDB, both of which sup-
port inclusion of ENE in the eighth edition (Fig. 7B).
These new N criteria were then validated using the
MSKCC-PMH institutional data set (Fig. 7C). After valida-
tion of the N criteria, the next step was to examine the inter-
play of these new T and N criteria for stage grouping. The
NCDB could not be used for this purpose because of the lack
of information on DOI of the primary tumor. Therefore, the
MSKCC-PMH data set was used for stage group analysis
using seventh edition AJCC/UICC criteria (without DOI or
ENE) (Fig. 8A). As seen in Figure 8A, the seventh edition
stage groupings do not discriminate between stages II and III,
an effect that may be attributable to the failure to account for
DOI and ENE, which were lacking in the T and N categories.

Head and Neck Cancers—Major 8th Edition Changes
134
CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians
 In recognition of these newer prognostic factors, the
MSKCC-PMH institutional data were re-interrogated
after appropriate adjustment of the stage groups, which
resulted in better discrimination of stage groups (Fig. 8B).
However satisfying, these stage groupings could not be vali-
dated through cancer registry data, because comparable data
on DOI of the primary tumor and ENE were not consistently
available from the NCDB. Therefore, although there are insti-
tutional data to support restructuring stage groups for OCC,
the stage groupings will remain unchanged in the eighth edi-
tion pending evaluation of additional cancer registry data sets.
Conclusion
The eighth edition Head and Neck AJCC Cancer Staging
Manual incorporates significant changes based on advances
in our understanding of the etiology and certain histologic
attributes of tumors. These include a separate staging algo-
rithm for HPV-associated cancer of the oropharynx;
changes to the tumor T categories in the nasopharynx, oral
cavity, and skin; and the addition of tumor ENE to the
lymph node category for most sites. The revisions included
in the eighth edition were based on evidence available from
large institutional and collaborative data sets.
The process that led to these changes highlights the need
to collect high-fidelity cancer registry-level data that can be
used to confirm prognostic observations identified in institu-
tional data sets. Future versions of the staging system may
well incorporate nomograms and personalized approaches;
but, for now, the eighth edition strikes a balance between a
personalized, complex system and a more general, simpler
one that maintains the user-friendliness and worldwide
acceptability of the traditional TNM staging paradigm.
