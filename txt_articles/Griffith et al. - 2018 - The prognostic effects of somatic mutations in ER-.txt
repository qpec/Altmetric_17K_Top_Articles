Here we report targeted sequencing of 83 genes using DNA from primary breast cancer
samples from 625 postmenopausal (UBC-TAM series) and 328 premenopausal (MA12 trial)
hormone receptor-positive (HR+) patients to determine interactions between somatic
mutation and prognosis. Independent validation of prognostic interactions was achieved
using data from the METABRIC study. Previously established associations between MAP3K1
and PIK3CA mutations with luminal A status/favorable prognosis and TP53 mutations with
Luminal B/non-luminal tumors/poor prognosis were observed, validating the methodological
approach. In UBC-TAM, NF1 frame-shift nonsense (FS/NS) mutations were also a poor
outcome driver that was validated in METABRIC. For MA12, poor outcome associated with
PIK3R1 mutation was also reproducible. DDR1 mutations were strongly associated with poor
prognosis in UBC-TAM despite stringent false discovery correction (q = 0.0003). In con-
clusion, uncommon recurrent somatic mutations should be further explored to create a more
complete explanation of the highly variable outcomes that typifies ER+ breast cancer.

 W
hile recent genomic studies have provided a compre-
hensive catalog of genes that accumulate somatic point
mutations and small insertions/deletions (indels) in
estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, there remains
considerable uncertainty as to how these newly discovered
mutations relate to disease outcomes1–3. Most genomic discovery
cohorts were neither uniformly treated nor followed long enough.
For ER+ disease in particular, prognostic studies require pro-
longed observation since relapses often occur after 5 years4.
Uniform treatment was a feature of a whole-genome sequencing
study of samples accrued from a neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor
(AI) clinical trial for ER+ clinical stage 2 or 3 disease, although
only short-term anti-proliferative response to AI was reported.
This investigation identified that mutations in MAP3K1, a tumor
suppressor gene involved in stress kinase activation, were asso-
ciated with indolent biological features and low proliferation
rates5. The resulting hypothesis was that MAP3K1 mutation
would be associated with favorable outcomes. In contrast, TP53
mutations associated with poor prognosis features and high
proliferation rates.
To more comprehensively address the relationships between
somatic mutations and outcomes in ER+ breast cancer, we report
herein an approach to detect somatic mutations in DNA isolated
from formalin fixed tumor blocks that were over 20 years old.
After curating existing mutational data from breast cancer
genomics discovery studies (Supplementary Data 1), 83 genes
were chosen for analysis (Supplementary Table 1). We applied
DNA hybrid capture, sequencing and somatic analysis to three
ER+ breast cancer discovery cohorts with contrasting clinical
characteristics: an older cohort treated with adjuvant tamoxifen
and no chemotherapy (UBC-TAM series6), a premenopausal
cohort uniformly treated with chemotherapy and randomized to
tamoxifen versus observation (NCIC-MA12 clinical trial7); and a
third mixed cohort that was used to expand the mutational
landscape analysis (POLAR) (Supplementary Table 2). We report
an analytical pipeline to identify somatic variants while com-
pensating for the lack of matched normal DNA, which is gen-
erally unavailable in the setting of older formalin-fixed tumor
material. Somatic mutations were analyzed for association with
standard clinical variables, wherein mutated TP53 and MAP3K1
served as a priori hypotheses for poor and good outcome,
respectively. Additional objectives were to identify new muta-
tional hotspots, assess interactions with PAM50-based intrinsic
subtypes and to determine mutation frequencies for therapeutic
targets. Validation was possible by comparing our results to those
in cBioPortal where the genes sequenced in the METABRIC
cohort overlapped with the 83 genes investigated in the study
described herein. We report consistent associations between NF1
frameshift/nonsense
(FS/NS)
and
non-synonymous
PIK3R1
mutations and poor outcomes that is independent of standard
prognostic variables. DDR1 mutations were also associated with
poor outcomes in the UBC-TAM series and significant despite
stringent false discovery correction. We conclude that uncommon
recurrent somatic mutations should be further explored to create
a more complete explanation of the highly variable outcomes that
typifies ER+ breast cancer.
Results
Sequencing and final study cohorts. University of British
Columbia Tamoxifen Series (UBC-TAM): these cases were drawn
from a well-annotated cohort of patients treated with adjuvant
tamoxifen without chemotherapy6. A total of 625 of 632 (98.8%)
patient samples that fully met study criteria passed a minimum
sequencing quality cutoff of at least 80% of targeted exonic bases
covered at greater than 20× with other quality metrics described
in the supplementary data (Supplementary Figure 1–5 and Sup-
plementary Data 2). Mean depth was correlated with input DNA
and negatively correlated with time since diagnosis (approximate
age of sample) and duplication rates were negatively correlated
with input DNA and positively correlated with sample age.
However, despite these trends, overall metrics were excellent with
an average of 135.8× coverage and 3.0% duplicate rate despite the
generally low input amounts and old sample age. The final patient
population had an average age of 67 at diagnosis (range: 40–89+).
All were treated with five years of adjuvant tamoxifen, and were
primarily postmenopausal, grade 2 or 3 cancers, of ductal histo-
logic subtype (Supplementary Table 2). All were ER+ (>1% cells
positive by IHC) and at least 88.6% were clinically HER2- (13/625
unknown).
A
subset
of
463
of
these
patients
had
PAM50 subtyping data available from a previous study6. The
median follow up in the cohort examined was 25 years and one
month.
NCIC-MA12 Trial cohort: these cases were drawn from a
clinical trial in premenopausal women treated with a standard
adjuvant chemotherapy regimen and randomized to tamoxifen
versus observation. A total of 459 patient samples passed the
minimum sequencing quality threshold (mean coverage: 200×),
of which 328 were hormone receptor positive (HR+; >1% cells
positive for ER or PR by IHC), and only the HR+ cohort were
included here for most analyses. The majority were premeno-
pausal (mean age of 45). All patients received chemotherapy, and
48% were treated with 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. A subset of
255 of these patients had PAM50 subtyping data available. The
median follow up in the cohort examined was 9.7 years.
POLAR cohort: this patient series was a case-control study of
ER+ (>1% cells positive by IHC) breast tumors, 175 of 194
(90.2%) patient samples passed minimum sequencing quality
thresholds (mean coverage: ×75). A case was defined as any
patient who relapsed during follow-up, and controls were defined
as lacking relapse through a similar follow-up duration. Based on
these definitions, there were 91 cases and 84 controls. Of the
cases, 43 were early relapses (<5 years since diagnosis) and 48
were late relapses (>5 years). Patients were only included if they
received adjuvant endocrine therapy, but chemotherapy was not
an exclusion criterion, nor was menopausal status. Because the
POLAR study was a case-control design, outcome data could not
be easily integrated into prognostic analysis. Therefore, these
cases were used in the mutation landscape and hotspot analyses
only.
Across the three cohorts, there were 1259 patient samples that
passed minimum sequencing quality thresholds and 1128 of these
were ER+ (UBC-TAM and POLAR) or ER and/or PgR+ (HR+)
(MA12).
Variant calling and filtering. A total of over 62 million variants
were identified in UBC-TAM. After extensive filtering against a
set of nearly 70,000 unmatched normal samples and manual
review to eliminate common polymorphisms and false positives
(see methods), 1991 putative somatic variants were identified (0
to 26 variants per patient). A set of 1693 mutations was defined as
the “non-silent” set for further analysis that excluded sequencing
variants in splice regions (except proximal splice site), RNA genes
(except MALAT1), UTRs, introns, and all silent mutations.
Finally, a set of 408 frameshift or nonsense mutations was
defined. The same filtering method was applied to both the
POLAR and MA12 data sets. A total of 540 putative somatic
mutations (436 non-silent, 145 FS/NS) were identified in POLAR,
and 2104 (1753 non-silent, 610 FS/NS) in MA12. Full details on
these variants are included in Supplementary Data 3 and sum-
marized for key genes in Supplementary Figure 6.

 Mutation landscape analysis. In 1128 samples passing quality
control standards, considering only non-silent mutations, 17
genes were mutated at a rate greater than 5%, and 6 at a rate
greater than 10%; PIK3CA was the only gene mutated in greater
than 20% of samples (Fig. 1a). The order from most recurrent to
least for the 10 most frequently mutated genes was: PIK3CA
(41.1%), TP53 (15.5%), MLL3 (13.4%), MAP3K1 (12.0%), CDH1
(10.5%), MALAT1 (10.0%), GATA3 (9.1%), MLL2 (8.7%),
ARID1A (7.2%), and BRCA2 (6.6%). This list correlates well with
previously reported recurrently mutated genes. For example, the
top 4 most significantly mutated (non-silent) genes in the ER+
subset of TCGA breast project3 were PIK3CA (24.0%), TP53
(14.6%), GATA3 (8.6%), and MAP3K1 (6.1%). Considering
METABRIC ER+ patients, the most recurrently mutated genes
were PIK3CA (~46%), TP53 (~21%), GATA3, MLL3, CDH1, and
MAP3K1 (all ~12–14%) demonstrating slightly higher but very
similar frequencies. The overall average non-silent mutation
frequency was estimated as 1.6 per MB of coding sequence (range:
0.5–5.8 mutations per MB, excluding samples with no mutations
called). In order to determine whether mutations in any gene pair
were mutually exclusive or co-occurring in this data set, a pair-
wise Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test was performed. Mutations
in PIK3CA and MAP3K1 were significantly more likely to co-
occur (after BH FDR correction) in the TAM dataset, and were
near significance in MA12 although not after correction (p =
0.08). These results are summarized in Supplementary Data 4.
Hotspot analysis. As anticipated8, mutations in PIK3CA at
E542K, E545K, and H1047R were highly recurrent in this study
with 69/1259 (5.5%) E542K, 104 (8.3%) E545K, and 181 (14.4%)
H1047R mutations (Supplementary Figure 6C). Mutations in the
ligand-binding domain of ESR1 (1.1%) were extremely rare3,9
(Supplementary Figure 6A). To uncover novel hotspots in these
data, both Chi-squared and Fisher’s exact tests were performed
using mutation frequencies from previous sequencing studies as
the expected values (see Methods for definition of multi-study
MAF file) (Supplementary Table 3). The most notable novel
finding was in CBFB (Fig. 1b). At least six different genomic
alterations were observed in 15 patients (Supplementary Data 3)
that affected the donor splice site of exon 2. Manual review of this
splice site identified at least two additional patients with evidence
for mutations at this location. The predicted effect of these
mutations is skipping of exon 2 or alternate donor site usage, each
likely resulting in loss-of-function of the CBFB protein. Addi-
tional splice site mutations were observed at the exon 2, exon 4,
and exon 5 acceptor sites of CBFB. ErbB2 exhibited the antici-
pated profile of activating mutations from earlier publications10.
Somatic mutation association with PAM50-based intrinsic
subtype. PAM50 intrinsic subtype calls were obtained from
previously published analyses to compare to their mutational
profiles for UBC-TAM and MA12 (HR+ only) studies. In both
studies about half the patients had luminal A tumors. However,
the MA12 cohort had a higher proportion of non-luminal sub-
types, with 19.8% HER2-E and 6.6% basal and fewer luminal B
tumors (25.1% versus 42.4%) (Fig. 2a, b). As expected, patients
with the HER2-E intrinsic subtype were enriched for HER2+ve
status compared to other subtypes (Fisher’s exact test p < 0.0001).
Of interest, in the HER2-enriched group there were 51 tumors
that were not HER2 amplified and of these 4 were HER2 mutant
(∼8%), indicating that HER2 mutation could be an occasional
explanation for a HER2-E subtype assignment in the absence of
HER2 amplification. For NF1 FS/NS mutations, there was also a
statistically significant association with the HER2-E subtype (p =
0.002) (Supplementary Figure 7B and Supplementary Data 5).
Notably NF1 non-silent mutations were enriched in the HER2-E
non-HER2 amplified subgroup, where they were present in 8/51
cases (16%). Compared to the frequency in all other subtypes 12/
582 (2%), this enrichment was significant (Fishers exact test p <
0.0001) (Supplementary Figure 7A left panel). This association
could be reproduced in the METABRIC data with an NF1 non-
silent mutation incidence in the HER2-E non-HER2 amplified
group of 8/80 (10%) versus 35/1283 (3%) in the rest of the sub-
types (p = 0.003) (Supplementary Figure 7A right panel). Age-
density plots by subtype serve to emphasize the large difference in
the median age between the two sample cohorts (43 versus 65),
and also the influence of age with respect to the intrinsic subtype
incidence. Namely, in the older UBC-TAM cohort, an influence
of age on intrinsic subtype was not observed (Fig. 2c). In contrast,
in the younger MA12 cohort, there is a younger peak incidence
with basal-like breast cancer than Luminal A disease (Fig. 2d).
Relationships between intrinsic subtype and mutation patterns
were also explored, classifying mutation positive status as “non-
silent”, “missense”, nonsense/frame-shift (FS/NS), or FS/NS+
splice site (Supplementary Data 5). The FDR corrected p-value
(q-value) took into account that 83 genes were examined. How-
ever, this level of false discovery detection could be viewed as
overly conservative in an exploratory analysis. Therefore, any
gene mutation with q-value association of <0.2 was considered
reportable for the purposes of subsequent validation efforts11–13.
For MA12, non-silent TP53 mutation was highly subtype-
associated because of the very high incidence in non-luminal
versus luminal subtypes. PIK3CA and MAP3K1 mutations were
associated with Luminal A disease in both cohorts (Supplemen-
tary Figure 7B). Finally, there was a strong association between
Luminal B status and non-silent (Supplementary Figure 7C), as
well as FS/NS mutations in GATA3 (Supplementary Data 5, q-
value = 0.006) for MA12 (but not UBC-TAM). GATA3 muta-
tions were present in 28–30% of Luminal B cases and less so in
luminal A cases (5%). Considering q values of <0.2 the associa-
tions between FS/NS and non-silent mutations in ATM and
Luminal B tumors in MA12 (8–13%) suggests that ATM dis-
ruption is also a possible luminal B driver (Supplementary Fig-
ure 7C), at least in younger women (MA12). Relationships
between age and mutation incidence were therefore also explored
(Supplementary Figure 7D), with the finding that both ATM
mutation and GATA3 mutations were associated with an earlier
age of onset within the luminal B category (Fig. 2e, f). Some ATM
mutations are likely to be germline (see discussion below), which
could partially explain the association with younger age.
Survival analysis according to somatic mutation. For the UBC-
TAM Series (Fig. 3a) univariate analysis, favorable prognostic
associations for breast-cancer-specific survival (BCSS) were
detected for non-silent mutations in MAP3K1, ERBB3, XBP1, and
PIK3CA (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Data 6). Adverse prognostic
effects were observed for non-silent mutations in DDR1 and
TP53, as well as for frame-shift and nonsense (FS/NS) mutations
in NF1. An analysis for recurrence-free survival (RFS) produced
similar results, except for ARID1B, which was marginally asso-
ciated with more favorable outcome. A multivariate Cox model
was applied to put each gene in the context of clinical parameters
(grade, tumor size, and node status). These analyses indicated
that the prognostic effects of non-silent DDR1, PIK3CA, GATA3
FS/NS, TP53, and MAP3K1 mutations were independent of grade
and pathological stage (Fig. 3c). Multiple correction testing,
yielded DDR1 as the only gene that remained significant with a q-
value of 0.0003 (Supplementary Data 6). For the MA12 clinical
trial cohort (Fig. 4a) we focused on overall survival associations,
as this was the primary endpoint of the study and the most robust

 endpoint. A number of rarely mutated genes were associated with
poor outcome in univariate analysis as displayed in Fig. 4b.
Multiple testing corrections indicated none of these findings
could be considered significant11–13. However, in multivariate
analysis, based on the uncorrected p-value, the prognostic effects
of mutations in ErbB2, ErbB4, LTK FS/NS, MAP3K4, PIK3R1,
RB1, RELN, and TGFB2 were independent of pathological stage
and grade (Fig. 4b).

 Fig. 1 Mutation recurrence and novel splice site mutation. a The overall mutation recurrence rate ranged from 41.1% of samples for PIK3CA to 0.0% for
PIN1. The figure depicts non-silent mutations for all 1128 patients for the top 17 most recurrently mutated genes (>5% recurrence). If a patient had multiple
mutations it is colored according to the “most damaging” mutation following the order presented in the Mutation Type legend (vertical color bar).
Mutations per MB were calculated using the total number of mutations observed over the total exome space corresponding to the tiled space from
“SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library v2.0”. A correction factor was applied to account for genes not assayed using the expected number of additional
mutations based on ER+ TCGA data. The coverage histogram (top sidebar) shows the percent of targeted exonic bases with at least 20×, 30×, and 40×
coverage. b Mutation recurrence frequencies (amino acid level) in this study were compared to previously reported mutation frequency from a multi-study
MAF file of six reported breast cancer sequencing studies (Supplementary Data 1). An entirely novel mutation “hot spot” was discovered affecting the exon
2 splice (donor) site of CBFB in at least 15 patients. Six different single nucleotide substitutions, insertions, and deletions were observed, all affecting either
the first or second base of the donor splice site. These mutations were most likely missed in previous studies because of a lack of sequencing coverage due
to the GC-rich nature of exons 1 and 2 of CBFB (Supplementary Figures 9, 10). Such mutations are predicted to significantly alter the canonical donor site
and result in either alternate donor usage or skipping of one or more exons of CBFB

 the UBC-TAM series (Fig. 3), nine genes with a univariate p-value
of <0.05 were brought forward for validation (Fig. 5). Of the six
overlapping genes also examined in METABRIC, consistent
prognostic effects independent of clinical variables were observed
for non-silent mutations in three genes, MAP3K1 (favorable),
TP53 (unfavorable), and NF1 FS/NS mutations (unfavorable). In
order to maintain coherence in discovery and validation patient
cohorts, a similar analysis was carried out restricting the patient
pool to postmenopausal patients only. No significant variation in
hazard ratio for candidate genes was observed (Supplementary
Table 4). For the MA12 series (Fig. 4), five shared genes were
identified with univariate p values of <0.05, yet only PIK3R1
mutations (non-silent or FS/NS) showed consistent adverse
prognostic effects (Fig. 6). The Kaplan–Meier survival plots for
the consistent adverse prognostic effects of NF1 FS/NS (TAM vs
METABRIC) and non-silent PIK3R1 (MA12 vs METABRIC)
mutations are illustrated in Fig. 7a–d. Copy number aberrations
and chromosomal instability have been associated with prognosis
across multiple cancer types, including ER-positive (ER+) breast
cancer15,17,18. To gauge the confounding nature of commonly
amplified genes in breast cancer, we further performed multi-
variate analysis on the candidate genes with cases of amplification
of MYC, FGFR1, CCND1, and ERBB2 (Supplementary Table 5).
We did not observe a significant change in the hazard ratios
reported in Figs. 5b and 6b.
Prognostic interactions between PIK3CA and MAP3K1. Since
PIK3CA and MAP3K1 mutations co-associate, the combined
effect of non-silent mutations in these genes was examined.
Patients with tumors exhibiting both genes mutated have a more
favorable clinical course than either singly mutant cases or cases
without either gene mutated. While the prognostic effects were
strongest in the UBC-TAM series, this result was also reproduced
in the METABRIC data (Fig. 7e, f).
Mutation analyses for uncommon targetable kinases. Of the 83
genes analyzed, at least eight are directly targetable with small
molecules or antibodies that are either FDA approved or in late-
stage development (Fig. 8). Pre-existing data on these mutations
is summarized (Supplementary Data 7). PIK3CA is not further
discussed here, since the mutation spectrum is well described and
large therapeutic studies are already underway. An examination
of the 23 mutations in ERbB2 revealed locations that were, as
expected, clustered in two major domains, with 2 of 23 having
extracellular domain mutations at residue 310 and 21 of 23
having kinase domain mutations between residues 755–84210,19.
To further investigate the preliminary finding of an adverse
prognostic effect for ERBB2 mutation in the MA12 series, an
examination of the METABRIC data indicated that known acti-
vating mutations in ErbB2 were associated with a near significant
adverse effect (HR = 1.71, p = 0.075) (Supplementary Figure 8).
For ERBB3, two known activating mutations were identified
(V104L and E928A)20. In total, ErbB2 exhibited the anticipated
profile of activating mutations from earlier publications10 with
22/1259 (1.7%) samples harboring known activating mutations
and another six variants of unknown significance in the kinase
domain or at the S310 residue (Fig. 8c). The DDR1 kinase domain
mutation, R776W, is possibly homologous to EGFR hotspot
mutation L858R, but the remaining DDR1 variants are of
unknown significance. For the mutations in JAK1, 3 of 12 are
loss-of-function mutations (frame shift or nonsense) and the
S816* mutation has been reported in a lung adenocarcinoma
sequencing data set21. The loss-of-function mutations in JAK1
have
been
shown
to
associate
with
immunotherapy
resistance22,23. A few mutations identified in ERBB4, MET, and
PDGFRA have been previously reported but those reported here
have not been functionally tested.
Discussion
This investigation adds to the knowledge on the impact of
somatic mutations in ER+ breast cancer by providing new data
on almost a thousand samples with prolonged follow up and
controlled adjuvant treatment. By combining these data with a
comprehensive overview of published information we report
herein the largest database studied to date. The size of our
database is critical to our conclusions as the investigation of the
prognostic effects of rarer mutations with an overall frequency of
5% or less requires very large sample sizes. Weaknesses include
the lack of treatment prediction because endocrine treatment in
UBC-Tam was uniform but not randomized. In MA12 the use of
tamoxifen was randomized, but the numbers were too small to
examine treatment interactions. The landscape of recurrently
mutated genes in ER+ breast cancer observed in this study is
consistent with reports where matched germline samples were
available, indicating that our variant filters were effective for
somatic mutation detection in a research setting. Overall, muta-
tion frequencies were higher in our cohort (e.g., for PIK3CA,
MLL3, MAP3K1) than the TCGA cohort, but were also lower for
a few specific genes (e.g., TP53 and GATA3). Due to higher
sequencing data coverage of recurrently mutated target genes
than TCGA and the use of a different hybrid capture reagent, we
were likely able to detect mutations that were missed with lower-
depth exome or whole-genome sequencing data. Differences in
patient populations may also be a factor. Frequencies were much
closer to reported values for METABRIC, which also used a
targeted sequencing approach. It is also possible that in some
instances we overestimated somatic mutation frequency, due to
the lack of matched normal samples and imperfections in our
germline polymorphism filtering. In particular, a significant
number of BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM mutations are likely de
novo germline mutations that we would not be able to easily
distinguish from somatic mutations. Of the 117 non-silent
Fig. 3 Candidate discovery from UBC-TAM cohort and prognosis evaluation. a DNA was extracted from tumor specimens from 947 patients with ER+
breast cancer treated with tamoxifen monotherapy for 5 years. 632 samples with adequate yield were sequenced for 83 genes known to be recurrently
mutated or breast cancer relevant. A total of 625 samples passed minimum quality checks and were sequenced to an average of 135.8× coverage. A total of
~62 million variants from the reference genome were identified. Extensive filtering and manual review reduced this list to 1991 putatively somatic variants.
Survival analysis was applied to non-silent and truncating gene mutation status versus disease outcome (relapse or breast-cancer-specific death). In
addition, mutations were analyzed for novel hotspots, patterns of mutual exclusivity or co-occurrence and association with clinical variables. b Forest plot

 BRCA1/2 mutations observed (from 110/1128 patients across all 3

impure tumor samples and heterozygous mutations. Indeed, the

 complexities the prognostic effects of somatic versus germline
BRCA1/2 and ATM mutations remain unresolved, however
attention should clearly be paid to therapeutic strategies for these
patients. The ATM findings deserve a particular highlight because
of the younger age/luminal B association and the current lack of
studies devoted to this population.
The discovery of a novel recurrent CBFB (core binding factor
subunit beta) splice site mutation in this cohort illustrates a
limitation of exome capture reagents. The affected bases in exon 2
of CBFB display reduced sequence coverage, possibly due to high
GC content, in the breast TCGA exome dataset (Supplementary
Figures 9–10). This site was mutated in at least 1.5% of ER+
breast cancers sequenced, bringing the overall rate of CBFB
mutations to nearly 6%, which should drive further investigation
of this gene in ER+ breast cancer pathogenesis. CBFB functions
as a subunit in a heterodimeric core binding transcription factor
that interacts with RUNX125. Consistent with this model, CBFB
mutants were mutually exclusive from RUNX1 mutants in this
cohort with only a single sample harboring non-silent mutations
in both CBFB and RUNX1.
The UBC-TAM and MA12 studies revealed different lists of
potentially prognostic mutations. Prognostic effects are likely to
be strongly affected by the use of systemic therapy, as well as by
patient age at diagnosis. The UBC-TAM series is the simplest

 study to interpret from a drug resistance perspective since the
only systemic therapy was tamoxifen. Thus, the consistent
adverse effect of NF1 FS/NS mutation on prognosis is intriguing
as this result is consistent with results from an in vitro screen for
tamoxifen resistance26. Understanding why only FS/NS muta-
tions predict poor outcome, rather than missense or other non-
silent mutations, will require further investigation. The associa-
tion of the HER2-E, non-HER2 amplified subset with non-
synonymous NF1 mutations was observed in both the discovery
and validation (METABRIC) data sets. It is a logical proposition
that mutations that activate RAS, like NF1 mutation, could create
a tumor with a similar transcriptional phenotype as some HER2
amplified breast cancers. PIK3R1 mutation also emerged as a
consistent poor prognosis mutation from the MA12 analysis, with
validation in METABRIC. The proposed favorable prognostic
effects of PIK3CA mutation were observed in the UBC-TAM
series, but were not found to be independent of stage and grade,
and PTEN mutations were neutral.
According to our validation results, NF1, PIK3R1, PIK3CA,
and TP53 are therefore likely to be prognostic drivers that are
independent of clinical variables. In postmenopausal women
treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy, DDR1, PRKDC, and
XBP1 should be further studied and of these DDR1 is the
strongest candidate because it was significant despite strict false
discovery correction. DDR1 is a collagen-binding receptor
expressed in epithelial cells that stabilizes E-cadherin-mediated
intracellular
adhesion27.
DDR1
mutations
also
occur
in
endometrial cancer28, acute leukemia29, and lung cancer30. Loss
of DDR1 (DDR1-null mice) produces hyper-proliferation and
abnormal branching of mammary ducts, suggesting DDR1 is a
breast tumor suppressor31. Mutations in PRKDC will potentially
produce a defective ATM response/low ATM levels32, which is
interesting in the context of the finding herein that ATM muta-
tions are a potential luminal B driver gene. The significance of a
defective ATM pathway as a cause of endocrine resistance is
highlighted by the recent finding that dysregulation of the MutL
complex (MLH1, PMS1, and PMS2) causes failure of ATM/
CHK2-based negative regulation of CDK4/633. Prognostic can-
didate mutations revealed by the MA12 analysis were different
from the UBC-TAM series, likely reflecting the different patient
profiles and adjuvant treatments illustrated in Fig. 2. The prog-
nostic effects of mutations in ERBB2, ERBB4, JAK1, LTK,
MAP3K4, MET, PDGFRA, RB1, RELN, and TGFB2 all await
further study with even larger sample sizes.
A limitation of this study is that the mutation data sets we
generated for UBC-TAM and MA12 cohorts lack comprehensive
assessment of copy number signatures that have been associated
with prognosis in ER+ breast cancer15,17,18. While multivariate
analysis considering key CNVs did not appear to affect our
prognostic associations, future studies may be needed to com-
pletely understand the interplay between simple and large-scale
variation for prognostic prediction. Another limitation to this
study was the heterogeneity in the data sets in terms of age,
treatment, and other factors that limited direct comparison and

 made validation with METABRIC somewhat challenging. The
collection of sufficiently large, uniformly treated populations with
long-term follow-up for discovery and validation remains a
challenge that must be addressed to fully characterize the prog-
nostic significance of somatic mutations, especially low frequency
mutations.
In conclusion, we have successfully utilized clinically well-
annotated, uniformly treated patient samples using DNA from
archival material greater than 20 years old without a matched
normal to explore the prognostic effects encoded by the muta-
tional landscape of ER+ breast cancer. We were able to confirm
our prospective hypothesis from our earlier studies5 that
MAP3K1 is associated with indolent disease and TP53 with
adverse outcomes. We also associated NF1 FS/NS mutations with
strong adverse effects on prognosis. Similarly, PIK3R1 mutations
were associated with an adverse prognosis, in contrast to PIK3CA
mutation which were weakly favorable. This suggests somatic
mutations in these two physically interacting gene products are
not biologically equivalent with respect to PI3 kinase pathway
activation and resistance effects. The possibility that the long tail
of low frequency mutation events in luminal type breast cancer
may harbor multiple molecular explanations for poor outcomes
should spur new collaborative efforts to thoroughly screen
thousands of properly annotated cases. Only after these iterative
efforts of proposing and confirming candidates will a clinically
useful and comprehensive somatic mutation-based classification
of ER+ breast cancer emerge. In the meantime, functional studies
should be pursued to understand the biological effects of low
frequency somatic mutations, prioritizing these studies according
to whether the mutations are driving an adverse prognostic
effect
and
whether
their
disruption
creates
a
therapeutic
vulnerability.
Methods
Patient samples. The focus of this analysis was ER-positive breast cancer patients
with long-term follow-up data available. As such, three main cohorts were available
to us, the University of British Columbia Tamoxifen Cohort (UBC-TAM) cohort,
the NCIC-MA12 trial (NCT00002542) cohort, and the POLAR cohort. Collection
for each of these cohorts is described below. Ethics board approvals were obtained
for all studies. For the UBC-TAM series, biomarker studies on the anonymized
archival specimens and clinical data were approved by the Clinical Research Ethics
Board of the British Columbia Cancer Agency. The MA12 trial was approved by
the NCIC Clinical Trials Group (CTG). The details of the conduct of this study are
published34. Analysis on anonymized archival specimens and clinical data were
approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Board of the British Columbia Cancer
Agency. For the analysis on the POLAR study, biomarker studies on the anon-
ymized archival specimens and clinical data were approved by the Clinical
Research Committee, Royal Marsden Trust and the National Research Ethics
Committee Research Ethics Committee, West Midlands, United Kingdom. The
Human Research Protection Office of Washington University also approved these
anonymized analyses.
UBC-TAM—In total, 947 samples were identified from the TAM series6,35 with
sufficient materials available for DNA isolation. Archival formalin-fixed paraffin
embedded (FFPE) blocks were subjected to histopathologic review and one to five
cores (1.25 mm) taken from tumor rich areas (>50%) for DNA isolation. Briefly,
the cores were de-paraffinized using Citri-Solv Clearing Agent (Fisherbrand #
22–143–975), the pellet washed with 100% ethanol and then dried at 55 °C. The
residual tissue pellet was incubated overnight with proteinase K solution (40 μl)
and the nucleic acid extracted per manufacturer’s directions using the Qiagen
Blood and Tissue Kit (catalog #69506). A total of 645 samples met the minimum
DNA yield requirement of 50 ng. Of these, five samples were excluded as duplicates
(higher yield sample was chosen per patient). An additional eight patients were
excluded if they had a metastasis at diagnosis or were not treated with tamoxifen
upon review of records. A minimum sequencing quality cutoff was applied,
requiring at least 80% of targeted bases covered at greater than 20× with other
quality metrics described in the supplementary data. The final population that
met all study criteria and had sufficient coverage (See REMARKS summary in
Fig. 3a for details) included 625 women diagnosed with estrogen receptor-positive
invasive breast cancer in the province of British Columbia of Canada between 1986
and 1992, as previously described6,35–37. These patients were treated with five years
of tamoxifen as the adjuvant monotherapy. The mean age of the cohort at diagnosis
of breast cancer was 66.9 years, and the median follow-up time was 11.7 years.
MA12—DNA isolations were performed as above. A total of 459 of 470 (97.7%)
patient samples met study criteria and passed the minimum sequencing quality
cutoff. The final patient population for most analyses only includes 328 HR positive
patients (see REMARKS summary in Fig. 4a for details), who had an average age of
45 at randomization (range: 30–57). All received chemotherapy (27% CEF, 44%
CMF, 29% AC) and 48% were treated with five years of adjuvant tamoxifen.
Patients were primarily premenopausal, with grade 2 or 3 (63%), nodal positive
(82%), and stage 2 (85%) breast cancers. 89% were clinically ER+ and 53%
clinically PR+ (42% unknown). PAM50 molecular subtype by a non-commercial
qRT-PCR assay was available from a previous study on 255 (78%) patients: 114
(44.7%) were luminal A, 61 (23.9%) luminal B, 48 (18.8%) Her2-enriched, 17
(6.7%) normal-like, and 15 (5.9%) basal-like subtype.
POLAR—DNA was isolated as above from 196 primary breast tumors from the
POLAR study, a case-control study of ER+ primary breast tumors from patients
diagnosed with breast cancer between 2000 and 2004 (to allow for long-term follow
up). A case was defined as a patient who relapsed with any recurrence during
follow-up. A control was defined as a patient who did not relapse during follow-up.
Patients were included if they were treated with 5 years of adjuvant endocrine
therapy. Pre and postmenopausal patients were eligible for the study and
chemotherapy was also permitted. There are three main differences between the
TAM series and the POLAR case-control cohort that warrant attention.
1.
TAM had no patients treated with chemotherapy whereas in POLAR, 52% of
patients received chemotherapy.
2.
TAM is a cohort study whereas POLAR is a case-control design hence
proportionally significantly more relapses are represented.
3.
POLAR was initially designed to select cases and matched controls from a
hospital cohort—matching on age at diagnosis, NPI category, type of
endocrine therapy for 5 years, and whether chemotherapy was administered
or not. Hence cases and controls (i.e., relapses and no relapses) have
previously been matched.
There were 91 relapse events in POLAR and 84 controls (referred to as No
Relapse). There were 43 early relapses (occurring up to five years after diagnosis)
and 48 late relapses (occurring beyond 5 years). Two samples had insufficient
material or failed at library construction. 175/194 samples passed sequence
coverage thresholds. Baseline clinical and pathological characteristics of each study
population are shown in Supplementary Table 2.
Gene panel and capture probe design. A meta-analysis of six published breast
cancer sequencing studies1,2,5,38–40 was performed and a multi-study mutation
annotation format (MAF) file compiled that included all somatic exome mutations
from the six studies (Supplementary Data 1). Kan et al.39 targeted ~1500 coding
genes whereas the other five used “whole-exome” capture approaches. Data were
gathered from supplementary materials of each study or the TCGA data portal for
that study3. Gene names were harmonized to official gene symbols using the NCBI
Human Gene Info table (available at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/gene/DATA/GEN-
E_INFO/Mammalia/Homo_sapiens.gene_info.gz as of 4/3/15). The columns for
protein change, mutation type (e.g., SNP, INS, DEL, etc), and mutation class (e.g.,
Missense, Silent, Frameshift, etc) were edited to use TCGA nomenclature. Finally,
clinical subtype data was gathered and appended to the dataset where available.
Intrinsic subtype was available for the Banerji et al.1, Ellis et al.5, and TCGA
studies3, while immunohistochemistry (IHC) results were available for the Kan
et al.39, Shah et al.40, Stephens et al.2, and TCGA publications. Genes were selected
from this multi-study MAF file that were (1) recurrently mutated in 2% or more of
cases or (2) recurrently mutated in 1% or more and determined to be druggable by
their membership in greater than two druggable gene categories or having greater
than two interactions with known anti-cancer drugs according to DGIdb41. Genes
or their obvious family members were excluded if known to be problematic for
variant calling (e.g., highly exonically variable). Unnamed genes (ENSG, KIAA,
LOC) were also excluded. Genes from two additional large-scale sequencing studies
were also considered. We included 15 of 16 genes reported as somatically altered by
Chanock et al. from their own targeted sequencing of a 21 gene panel42. Three
genes that were reported as deleted by the Curtis et al. study of copy number data
in ~2000 patients were also included15. Further literature review was performed to
include genes of known relevance to breast cancer (e.g., BRCA1, BRCA2, ERBB2,
ESR1, and PRLR43), not meeting any of the criteria above. This resulted in a final
list of 83 breast-cancer-related genes (Supplementary Table 1). Biotinylated 120 bp
oligonucleotide probes were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT,
Coralville IA) and required to have no more than 50bp gaps between probes, and
greater than 50% unique alignment to the reference genome and non-repetitive
sequence content. These genes were targeted comprehensively with 337,144bp of
unique coding exon sequences tiled by 3029 120 mer probes (a unique tiled space of
362,572 bp) (Supplementary Data 8).
Library construction and sequencing. TAM—Automated dual indexed libraries
were constructed with 50–250 ng of genomic DNA utilizing the KAPA HTP
Library Kit (KAPA Biosystems) on the SciClone NGS instrument (Perkin Elmer)
targeting 250 bp inserts. Libraries with a starting input between 50–149 ng were
enriched for 10 PCR cycles and libraries with a starting input between 150–250 ng
were enriched for eight PCR cycles. A total of 92 libraries were pooled pre-capture

 generating a 4.6 µg library pool. Library pools were hybridized with a custom set of
probes (see above). The concentration of each captured library pool was deter-
mined through qPCR according to the manufacturer’s protocol (KAPA Biosys-
tems) to produce cluster counts appropriate for the Illumina HiSeq2000
platform. One lane of 2 × 100 sequence data generated an average of 375 Mb of
data per sample. An average of 135.8× mean depth of coverage was achieved per
sample.
MA12—Automated dual indexed libraries were constructed as above. A total of
90 libraries were pooled pre-capture generating a 5 µg library pool. Library pools
were double hybridized with a custom set of probes (see above). The initial 4 h
hybridization utilized the standard amount of probes followed by eight PCR cycles
for enrichment. The second hybridization only required half of the standard probe
concentration, followed by nine enrichment PCR cycles. The concentration of each
captured library pool was determined as above to produce cluster counts
appropriate for the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform. Two lanes of 2 × 125 sequence
data generated an average of 668 Mb of data per sample. An average of 200× mean
depth of coverage was achieved per sample.
POLAR—Automated dual indexed libraries were constructed with 25–250 ng of
genomic DNA utilizing the KAPA HTP Library Kit (KAPA Biosystems) on the
SciClone NGS instrument (Perkin Elmer) targeting 250 bp inserts. Libraries with a
starting input between 25 and 149 ng were enriched for 11 PCR cycles and libraries
with a starting input between 150 and 250 ng were enriched for eight PCR cycles. A
total of 64 libraries were pooled pre-capture generating a 5 µg library pool. Library
pools were hybridized with a custom set of probes (see above). The concentration
of each captured library pool was determined as above to produce cluster counts
appropriate for the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform. One lane of 2 × 125 sequence
data generated an average of 750 Mb of data per sample. Approximately 75× mean
depth of coverage was achieved.
Primary variant calling and pre-filtering. Variant calling was performed with the
Genome Modeling System as previously described44. Specifically, sequence data
were aligned to reference sequence build GRCh37-lite-build37 using bwa version
0.5.945 (params: -t 4 -q 5::), merged using picard version 1.46 [http://broadinstitute.
github.io/picard], then deduplicated with picard version 1.46. SNVs were detected
using the union of samtools version r96346 and VarScan version 2.2.647
(params:–min-coverage 3–min-var-freq 0.08–p-value 0.10–strand-filter 1–map-
quality 10) and processed through false-positive filter v1 (params:–bam-readcount-
version 0.4–bam-readcount-min-base-quality 15–max-mm-qualsum-diff 100).
Indels were detected using VarScan version 2.2.6 (params: same as for SNVs) and
filtered by false-indel version v1 (params:–bam-readcount-version 0.4–bam-read-
count-min-base-quality 15–max-mm-qualsum-diff 100). Variants were annotated
using Ensembl version 70. The initial variant set was expected to be dominated by
germline variants and false positives. Therefore, a series of filters were applied.
Variants were restricted to the regions of targeted genes. Variants were further
excluded if found to have a global minor allele frequency in 1000 genomes (1092
individuals)38, NHLBI exomes (SP6500SI-V2, 6503 individuals)48, or ExAC49 data
sets greater than 0.1%. The 1000 genomes data (phase 1, release v3) were obtained
directly from ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk and via dbSNP (v137). NHLBI
Exomes were obtained from the Exome Variant Server (NHLBI GO Exome
Sequencing Project, Seattle, WA, http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/, downloaded
23 July 2012). Finally, a set of exome data for 151 unmatched normal blood
samples50 were processed through the identical variant calling pipeline as above.
Any variant called in this study that was also observed in 10 or more of the
unmatched normal samples was eliminated. This last filter was an attempt to
eliminate common pipeline-related artifacts and common polymorphisms not
present (or called) in 1000 genomes or NHLBI exomes. Variants from samples that
failed coverage QC (Supplementary Data 2) were excluded.
Variant post-filtering. Inspection of the most highly recurrent variants identified
several unlikely events in FRG1B, MAP3K4, and MLL that were mutated in more
than 95% of samples. It was hypothesized that additional technical (alignment
related) artifacts were causing these likely false positives. Rather than rely on
variant calls in unrelated normals, a read counting approach was used to look for
evidence of pipeline-related artifacts that might explain these variants. First, all
variants were assessed for readcount support in a set of exome sequence data for
912 blood normal samples from the TCGA Breast Cancer project3. Variants were
excluded from our list if at least 1% of TCGA samples had evidence of the same
variant with at least three supporting reads, 1% VAF and 20× total coverage.
Further inspection of recurrent variants in this newly filtered set identified two
indels in the genes RELN and FOXC1 that remained at suspiciously high quantities.
Upon review of the TCGA normal exome panel it was discovered that the positions
for these indels had very poor sequence coverage preventing identification of
artifacts in these regions. Therefore, we further filtered against a set of 87 whole-
genome sequenced blood normals also from the TCGA breast project. The same
criteria were used as above except for a sample threshold of 2 out of 87. As a final
step of quality control, each of these variants were manually reviewed. The entire
pipeline was used on a set 16 tumors, sequenced with the same panel, for which
matched normal variant calls (filtered and reviewed) were also available51. This
identified a small number of remaining low-support false positives. Finally, a
Bayesian classifier was applied as previously described52 to eliminate variants not
predicted to be somatic with a binomial log likelihood ratio less than 10 for SNVs
and less than six for indels.
Detection of low frequency variants of known or potential clinical relevance.
To ensure that variants of known clinical relevance were not missed by automated
variant calling approaches, a knowledge-based variant calling strategy was per-
formed focused on the mutations in the Database of Curated Mutations53. This
method scans directly for evidence of variants in raw alignment data using a
database of mutations thought to be clinically or functionally relevant. At time of
analysis the database included 413 total variant-disease entries for 35 genes from
My Cancer Genome54, Dienstmann et al.55 and manual curation of the literature.
These include well described variants of relevance in other cancers (e.g., BRAF
V600E), as well as those specific to breast cancer such as ESR1 ligand-binding
domain10,56 and ERBB2 kinase domain mutations57. All samples were scanned for
these known positions and potential variant calls made where at least five reads
supported the variant with at least 1% VAF and 20× total coverage (Supplementary
Data 3).
Hotspot analysis. The multi-study MAF file used for our original gene panel
design (see above) was used as a reference to determine which variants in our study
(if any) might represent novel sites of recurrent mutation, so called “hotspots”. A
recurrent mutation was considered novel if it was significantly enriched in our
cohort by Fisher’s exact test. Variants in both data sets were aggregated by amino
acid position and counted. Each position was considered separately for the pur-
poses of testing, and a minimum of three mutations in either cohort was required
for inclusion.
Univariate statistical analysis. Patients were divided by mutation status or
truncating mutation status for each gene. Fisher’s exact and chi-squared tests were
used for hotspot analysis, mutual exclusivity or co-occurrence, and other catego-
rical clinical statistics (e.g., mutation status vs intrinsic subtype) as appropriate.
Mutual exclusivity or co-occurrence tests were only performed for the top seven
genes with the highest non-silent mutation rate. Paired t-tests or Mann–Whitney U
tests (depending on normality of distributions tested via Kolmogorov–Smirnov
test) were used for comparing group means for age, number of positive nodes, and
tumor size. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was performed for breast-cancer-
specific survival (BCSS), relapse free survival (RFS; any regional or distant relapse),
or overall survival (OS) with non-silent or truncating mutation status as a factor.
Significant survival differences between the groups were determined by log-rank
(Mantel–Cox) test. Survival tests were only performed if at least 15 patients had a
non-silent mutation or at least eight patients had a truncating mutation. The
Benjamini–Hochberg method was performed for multiple testing corrections to
report the false discovery rate adjusted p-value (q-value).
Multivariate statistical analysis. The multivariate Cox proportional-hazard
model was fitted to BCSS and RFS separately on the mutation status of a gene,
besides classical clinical variables including node status (0 vs. 1~3 vs. 4+ positive),
grade (1 or 2 vs. 3), and tumor size (1 vs. 2 vs. 3 vs. 4). To avoid the common issue
of non-proportional-hazard and to clarify whether a gene’s mutation shows early
or late prognostic effect, the survival endpoints were each analyzed using the Cox
model splitting at year 5. To adjust for multiplicity, the permutation procedure was
performed. At each permutation, the survival and event outcome, together with
clinic data, was permuted while mutation data of all genes were untouched but
their original association with survival adjusted for clinical data was changed due to
the permutation. The same Cox model was fitted on the permuted data to have its
accompanied Wald test p-value derived. The permuted p-value associated with a
gene’s mutation was finally calculated as the proportion of permutations where at
least one gene showed better p-value than the gene’s original p-value for a survival
endpoint. All statistical analyses were performed in the R statistical programming
language with core, “survival” and “multtest” libraries. Genomic visualizations were
created with ProteinPaint58 and GenVisR59.
Data availability. All mutation calls are made available as a MAF file with this
publication. The raw sequence data from UBC-TAM patients are available in the
database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) under accession number [dbGaP:
phs001234]. Raw sequence data from MA12 and POLAR could not be deposited in
public repository due to patient consent issues and complexities of institutional
certification. However, these data are available from the authors (contact Obi
Griffith and Matthew Ellis). Primary clinical outcome data for UBC-TAM and
MA12 can be made available to qualified researchers through application to the
Canadian Cancer Trials Group. Primary clinical outcome data for POLAR can be
made available to qualified researchers through application to Mitch Dowsett at the
Ralph Lauren Centre for Breast Cancer Research.
