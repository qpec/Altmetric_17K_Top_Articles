In Brief
The role of dopamine in signaling rewards
is well known, but here Broussard et al.
show that dopamine D1-like receptor
activity in the hippocampus is necessary
for retention of aversive memories. The
results indicate dopaminergic innervation
and function within the hippocampus
underlying long-term synaptic
potentiation associated with aversive
memory retention.

SUMMARY
Dopamine release during reward-driven behaviors
influences synaptic plasticity. However, dopamine
innervation and release in the hippocampus and its
role during aversive behaviors are controversial.
Here, we show that in vivo hippocampal synaptic
plasticity in the CA3-CA1 circuit underlies contextual
learning during inhibitory avoidance (IA) training.
Immunohistochemistry and molecular techniques
verified sparse dopaminergic innervation of the hip-
pocampus from the midbrain. The long-term synap-
tic potentiation (LTP) underlying the learning of IA
was assessed with a D1-like dopamine receptor
agonist or antagonist in ex vivo hippocampal slices
and in vivo in freely moving mice. Inhibition of D1-
like dopamine receptors impaired memory of the IA
task and prevented the training-induced enhance-
ment of both ex vivo and in vivo LTP induction. The
results indicate that dopamine-receptor signaling
during an aversive contextual task regulates aversive
memory retention and regulates associated synaptic
mechanisms in the hippocampus that likely underlie
learning.
INTRODUCTION
Dopamine (DA) neurons arising from the ventral tegmental area
(VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) contribute dur-
ing the formation of rewarded behaviors (Bayer and Glimcher,
2005; Schultz, 1986, 1998). DA neurons fire phasic bursts in
response to unpredicted reward, and their phasic firing begins
to track neutral stimuli that predict those rewards (Hollerman
and Schultz, 1998). This firing characteristic of DA neurons sug-
gests that they are highly effective at pairing neutral stimuli to un-
conditioned stimuli, and this property provided evidence that DA
signals are a neural substrate of reward prediction (Berridge and
Robinson, 1998; Dayan and Balleine, 2002; Montague et al.,
2004; Schultz et al., 1997).
Recent studies indicate that DA neurons have a more hetero-
geneous response profile (Henny et al., 2012). For example, dor-
sal VTA neurons are typically inhibited by footshocks, but ventral
VTA neurons may be phasically excited by noxious stimuli (Bri-
schoux et al., 2009; Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010; Zweifel
et al., 2011). Aversive events have been shown to increase the
firing rate of a subset of VTA DA neurons and, as a result, in-
crease DA release in target areas, such as the striatum or medial
prefrontal cortex (Budygin et al., 2012; Dong et al., 2010; Lammel
et al., 2011). Recent studies indicate that a DA neuron’s
response to negative or positive stimuli is largely dependent
upon the neuron’s presynaptic inputs, and the dopaminergic
signal influences separate brain regions depending on valence
(Lammel et al., 2011, 2012, 2014). These findings suggest that
DA signaling may encode beyond prediction
errors and
contribute to synaptic plasticity required for updating memory
of environmental salience, and that these DA signals act upon
specific neural targets.
One such potential target is the hippocampus. Earlier evi-
dence indicated that dopaminergic projections originating pri-
marily from the midbrain (including the VTA, substantia nigra,
and retrorubral field) project directly to the hippocampus (Gas-
barri et al., 1994a, 1994b, 1996). Quantitative real-time PCR
confirmed that D1 and D5 receptors are found in the hippocam-
pus, including the CA1 (Mu et al., 2011). Physiological evidence
demonstrated that D1 and D5 receptors are important for
controlling spike timing dependent plasticity within the hippo-
campus (Yang and Dani, 2014). Also, there is functional evidence
that indicates that drugs of abuse, such as nicotine (Tang and
Dani, 2009; Zhang et al., 2010) and methylphenidate (Jenson
et al., 2015), recruit dopaminergic neurotransmission to influ-
ence synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus. Dopaminergic

 points in the retention interval also seems to be important
for successful consolidation of long-term memories (Rossato
et al., 2009). Despite this evidence, there is currently some con-
troversy about the source of dopaminergic innervation in the hip-
pocampus (Smith and Greene, 2012), suggesting that significant
dopaminergic neurotransmission is the result of extra-synaptic
volume transmission from other sources (Agnati et al., 1995;
Borgkvist et al., 2012), such as the locus coeruleus (Walling
et al., 2012).
In this study, we used virally introduced molecular markers to
label dopaminergic synaptic terminals arising from the midbrain
to determine whether there is significant innervation from
midbrain DA areas. Then, we tested whether neurotransmission
at D1-like receptors was important for the acquisition of aversive
memories in an inhibitory avoidance (IA) task. After finding a
sparse direct projection of midbrain DA neurons to the hippo-
campus and evidence of dopaminergic influence in the retention
of IA learning, we tested the effects of D1-like receptors on mea-
sures of synaptic plasticity. We found that dopaminergic activity
regulated IA-induced CA1 LTP measured from single pyramidal
neurons in ex vivo slices or from in vivo field excitatory postsyn-
aptic potentials (fEPSPs) in freely moving mice.
RESULTS
Evidence for Innervation of the Hippocampus by
Midbrain Dopamine Neurons
Dopamine transporters (DATs) have been shown to be located
on dopamine (DA) fibers and terminals (Nirenberg et al., 1996;
Shimada et al., 1991, 1992). To examine whether there is a
direct dopaminergic projection to the hippocampus, we in-
jected a recombinant adeno-associated virus (Grimm et al.,
2008; Tsai et al., 2009) (AAV-EF1a-DIO-synaptophysin:GFP)
containing a double-floxed inverted open reading frame encod-
ing synaptophysin-GFP into the midbrain DA area of adult
Slc6a3ires-cre/+ knockin and Slc6a3+/+ (wild-type [WT]) mice (Fig-
ures 1A and 1B). This AAV vector facilitates the expression of
GFP specifically in the synaptic terminals of neurons containing
DATs, exclusively in Cre-expressing cells. Because synapto-
physin is a synaptic vesicle protein, this procedure concen-
trated the GFP fluorophore into DA terminals of neurons from
the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra
(SN). By concentration of the fluorophore into the synaptic ter-
minals, we increased the likelihood of finding DA-positive
innervation.
As positive controls, 2 weeks after injection, we inspected the
brains of injected mice and found prominent labeling of projec-
tions and cell bodies in the VTA (Figure 1C) and labeled terminals
in the ventral striatum (Figure 1D) and medial prefrontal cortex
(Figure 1E), major known targets for innervation by midbrain
DA neurons. GFP-positive terminals were also found throughout
the CA1 region of Cre-positive mice (Figures 1F and 1H). This
expression was significantly greater relative to Cre-negative
mice (Figure 1G): 0.83% ± 0.03%, n = 5 for Slc6a3ires-cre/+;
0.09% ± 0.004%, n = 3 for WT (Figure 1I). We inspected the locus
coeruleus and found punctate terminals, but no cell bodies
labeled (Figure 1J), verifying that the labeling arose from the
midbrain not the locus coeruleus. To test the specificity of
Slc6a3ires-cre/+ expression, we checked the cerebellum of in-
jected Slc6a3ires-cre/+ mice and found virtually no green fluores-
cence in the cerebellum (0.003%, data not shown). Likewise,
there was no GFP fluorescence in the hypothalamus, which is
near to the midbrain DA areas (Figures S1A and S1B). Thus,
the injections were restricted to the midbrain DA areas, and there
the synaptophysin-GFP was found to co-localize with the
catecholamine synthesis enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
(Figure S1C).
To verify that the synaptophysin signal we observed in the
hippocampal CA1 is indeed dopaminergic terminals, we injected
the midbrains of a second group of Slc6a3ires-cre/+ mice with Syn-
aptophysin-Ruby-Red (AAV-EF1a-DIO-synaptophysin:RFP) and
immunostained with an antibody against TH (Figure 2A). We
observed nearly complete co-localization between the Synapto-
physin-Ruby-Red and TH (Figures 2A and 2B), confirming that
the synaptic terminals are dopaminergic and originate from the
midbrain: Ruby-Red/TH double-positive terminals, 93% ± 2%,
n = 6.
Dopamine-Regulated Acquisition of Inhibitory
Avoidance Memories
To test the hypothesis that DA regulates acquisition of IA mem-
ory, we injected groups of animals with SCH 23390 (SCH), a D1/
D5 receptor antagonist, prior to footshock training (Figure 3A).
During IA training, the mice received a footshock upon entering
the dark side of the training chamber from the lighted side of
the chamber. The latency to enter the darkened side was exam-
ined at three SCH doses (0.2, 0.1, and 0.05 mg/kg, i.p.). Only the
higher doses of SCH slowed the approach latency during
training (Figure S2): p < 0.01, n = 4–8. Therefore, we used the
lowest dose of SCH (0.05 mg/kg) that did not slow the initial
approach of mice to the dark side of the light/dark chamber
(Figure S2).
24 hr after training (i.e., footshock), control mice injected with
saline
significantly
delayed
entering
the
dark
(previously
shocked) side (Figure 3B, black bars). On the contrary, the la-
tency to approach the dark (shocked) side was not delayed in
SCH-treated mice at three different shock intensities (Figure 3B,
red bars). This dose of SCH (0.05 mg/kg, i.p.) also did not impair
short-term memory (STM) because approach latency remained
similar to controls at 1 and 3 hr after the shock training (Fig-
ure 3C). In summary, the D1/D5 antagonist, at a dose that did
not influence approach latency during training and did not impair
short-term memory, inhibited long-term memory retention in this
IA task.
To test whether the affected dopaminergic receptors resided
within the hippocampus, we implanted bilateral cannulas directly
above the CA1 and infused SCH (1 ml, 1 mg/ml concentration
given at 0.5 ml/min) 15 min prior to IA training. When tested
24 hr later, direct hippocampal infusions of the D1-like antago-
nist significantly reduced approach latency compared to saline
controls (Figure 3D): p < 0.05, unpaired t test, n = 7, 9. Injecting
a higher dose (0.2 mg/kg, i.p.) of SCH 23390 after IA training did
not influence long-term memory retention 24 hr later, as indi-
cated by an approach latency significantly higher after testing
(Figure 3E): training versus testing p < 0.01, n = 10. Acting oppo-
site to the D1-like antagonist, the D1-like agonist, SKF 81297

 (0.9 mg/kg), enhanced IA retention 72 hr after a moderate
(0.4 mA) footshock (Figure 3F): p < 0.05, n = 10, 32. This result
suggests that elevated DA D1R activity during training enhances
retention of a more difficult training task, which was IA memory at
a longer retention interval (i.e., 72 hr) to a moderate footshock
(0.4 mA).
In order to test whether b-adrenergic (norepinephrine, NE)
neurotransmission was important for learning the IA task, we
injected two doses (10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, i.p.) of the b2-
adrenergic antagonist, Timolol (Tim), prior to IA training. The
approach latency was significantly greater when tested after
24 hr retention, indicating that mice still learned to avoid the
dark side (shocked side) of the chamber even when b2-adren-
ergic receptors were inhibited (Figure 3G): p < 0.01, paired
t tests, n = 10, 10.
Inhibitory Avoidance Training Increased the AMPA/
NMDA Ratio in the CA1
Learning the context of IA is expected to engage synaptic plas-
ticity mechanisms in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Whit-
lock et al., 2006). To gain insight into whether LTP occurred in
the CA1 region following IA training, we cut ex vivo slices and
determined the AMPA/NMDA ratio (Ungless et al., 2001) from
CA1 pyramidal neurons while stimulating the Schaffer collateral
input (Figure 4A). IA training increased the AMPA/NMDA ratio
at the CA3-CA1 synapses when measured at 1.5 hr after the
footshock, as compared to walk-through controls that were
not shocked (Figures 4B and 4C): 0.59 ± 0.06 in control versus
0.93 ± 0.06 after IA, n = 12, 6, p < 0.01 unpaired t test. The ratio
returned to baseline 24 hr after the footshock (Figures 4D and
4E): 0.66 ± 0.10 in control versus 0.59 ± 0.10 after IA, n = 6, 6,

 p > 0.05 unpaired t test. These results demonstrate an associa-
tion between learned avoidance and an increase in the AMPA/
NMDA ratio in the CA1 of the hippocampus.
As a negative control, we tested the effects of IA on the AMPA/
NMDA ratio by recording from dentate granule cells while stimu-
lating the medial perforant path (Figure 4F). We recorded the
AMPA/NMDA ratio of granule cells in the dentate gyrus 1.5 hr
after the footshock and found no difference relative to walk-
through controls (Figures 4G and 4H): 0.77 ± 0.06 in control
versus 0.63 ± 0.07 at 1.5 hr after footshock, n = 10, 11, p >
0.05 unpaired t test. Similarly, 1 day after training and following
testing of memory retention, there was no difference between
the footshock and the no-footshock groups (Figures 4I and 4J):
0.70 ± 0.10 in control versus 0.57 ± 0.06 at 1 day after training,

Inhibitory Avoidance Training Increased the Slope of
CA1 fEPSPs In Vivo
The ex vivo slice studies (Figure 4) suggest that IA-induced long-
term synaptic potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region. Therefore, we
measured in vivo synaptic strength along the Schaffer collateral
input to CA1 in freely behaving mice to determine whether there
was synaptic potentiation associated with the IA learning task in
real time. We monitored synaptic transmission from the stratum
radiatum of the CA1 by stimulating the contralateral Schaffer
collateral axons (indicated in Figure 5A; also see Figure S3)
before and after IA training (Figure 5B). The day before training
(�1 day) we recorded baseline fEPSP measurements from freely
moving mice that were well habituated to the recording box (Fig-
ure 5C). These baseline recordings of synaptic responses were
required to remain stable over the 30-min period on the day
before (�1 day) and the day of IA training (0 day) to justify contin-
uation of the multi-day in vivo recording paradigm (Figure 5C).
The baseline recordings on 0 day were taken again for 30 min
immediately prior to IA training, and we required continued sta-
bility from �1 day of the fEPSP slope in both the control and IA
groups: p > 0.05, n = 4 for control, n = 9 for IA. Walk-through con-
trols that were exposed to the IA apparatus but not shocked
demonstrated no significant change in the slope of the fEPSP
of the CA3-CA1 circuit (Figure 5C, white circles): F(41,123) =
1.165; p > 0.05. IA training significantly increased the slope of
the fEPSPs (Figure 5C, black circles): F(41, 328) = 5.065, p <
0.01. Example fEPSPs are shown (Figure 5B) at the times indi-
cated in the recording time course (Figures 5C, 1, and 2). In
both groups synaptic transmission returned to baseline levels
the following day (1 day): controls, F(17, 51) = 0.50; IA, F(17, 136) =
0.45; both p > 0.05, n = 4, 9.
Learning-Induced In Vivo LTP Required Activity of D1-
like DA Receptors
We recorded fEPSPs from the stratum radiatum of the CA1 while
the contralateral Schaffer collaterals were stimulated (Figure 6A).
As always, a long-term stable baseline was required on �1 day
and 0 day before the injections and before the continuation of
recording on 0 day. As in Figure 5 (without the inhibitors), IA
training increased the slope of the fEPSP that persisted after in-
hibition of b2-adrenergic receptors with Tim (10 mg/kg, i.p., Fig-
ures 6B and 6C, gray traces and circles): F(41,164) = 1.98; p < 0.01,
n = 5. However, following inhibition of D1-like receptors with
SCH (0.05 mg/kg, i.p.), IA training did not significantly change
the slope of the fEPSP (Figures 6B and 6C, red traces and cir-
cles): F(41, 246) = 1.35; p > 0.05. As in previous experiments (Fig-
ure 2), SCH significantly impaired footshock memory retention of
IA by the implanted mice (Figure S4, red bar): 61.2 ± 31.0 s
approach latency, n = 7, p = 0.12, paired t test. After Tim injec-
tion, implanted mice retained the IA memory (Figure S4, gray
bar): 131.2 ± 20.1 s approach latency, n = 5, p < 0.05, paired
t test. Separate in vivo fEPSP recordings showed that neither
drug in the absence of training changed basal synaptic transmis-
sion (Figure S5): F(41, 246) = 1.03, p > 0.05, n = 7 for SCH alone;
F(41,164) = 0.94, p > 0.05, n = 5 for Tim alone. These results sug-
gest that DA neurotransmission influences learning and the
associated synaptic plasticity along the CA3-CA1 pathway after
aversive conditioning.
Inhibiting D1-like Dopamine Receptors Prevented IA
Learning and Synaptic Plasticity
After demonstrating that the IA learning-induced increase in the
AMPA/NMDA ratio were specific in the hippocampus to the CA3-
CA1 circuit, we tested the hypothesis that DA D1-like activity is
necessary for increases in the AMPA/NMDA ratio. The D1-like
receptor
inhibitor,
SCH,
at
doses
that
inhibited
learning
(0.05 mg/kg; Figures 3B and S4) also inhibited IA-induced in-
creases in the AMPA/NMDA ratio (Figures 7A–7C). In contrast,
the b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, Tim (10 mg/kg), did not
block learning-induced changes in the AMPA/NMDA ratio (Fig-
ures 7D–7F). These results are consistent with D1-like receptor

 activation significantly influencing CA1-CA3 IA-induced synaptic
potentiation.
DISCUSSION
Fluorescent markers associated with DATs and TH indicated
that dopaminergic fibers and terminals project sparsely from
the midbrain DA neurons to the dorsal CA1 (Figures 1 and 2).
A low dose of a D1-like receptor antagonist did not impair the
approach time (latency) for IA training and did not impair short-
term memory (Figure 3C) but did prevent the long-term retention
(24 hr) of the fear memory (Figure 3B). Training in the IA task pro-
duced significant increases in the AMPA/NMDA ratio of the CA1
synapses (Figure 4C) and significantly increased the slope of the
fEPSP in the CA1 of freely moving mice (Figure 5C). D1-like re-
ceptor inhibition blocked learning-induced increases in the slope
of the fEPSP in the CA3-CA1 circuit (Figure 6) and blocked the
learning-induced enhancement in the AMPA/NMDA ratio in the
CA1 (Figure 7C). Taken together, these results suggest that
D1-like receptor activity in the hippocampus contributes to the
synaptic plasticity associated with acquisition of contextual
memory required for long-term retention of aversive memories.
Anatomical Evidence of a Direct Midbrain Dopaminergic
Projection to the Hippocampus
There is known noradrenergic innervation of the hippocampus,
and D1-like receptor activity can arise from DA released from
noradrenergic innervation. Much of the DA receptor activity
may arise from neurons originating in the locus coeruleus (Smith
and Greene, 2012). Our results also support a sparse direct
projection from midbrain DA neurons to the hippocampus as
indicated by GFP- and Ruby-Red-synaptophysin staining of
DAT-expressing neurons (Figures 1 and 2). Injections were
localized to the midbrain and no fluorescence was found in the
hypothalamus or from the cell bodies in the locus coeruleus (Fig-
ure 1J), which precludes noradrenergic neurons as the source of
the labeling that we observed in the hippocampus. Furthermore,
fluorescent labeling of terminals in the CA1 resulting from viral

tency when tested 24 hr later (saline injection, black

different footshock intensities: n = 9–11/group. The
results are the following: 0.3 mA, 0.4 mA, and 0.8

16.44 ± 3.19 s, n = 10, 9; Sal 0.4 mA = 78.5 ±
16.47 s, SCH 0.4 mA = 7.4 ± 2.73 s, n = 10, 10; Sal

 infection of the VTA/SNc region highly co-localized with TH,
identifying these terminals as dopaminergic (Figure 2). These
data support previous evidence arising from retrograde tracers
injected in the hippocampus that indicated dopaminergic inner-
vation of the hippocampus from the VTA/SNc (Broussard et al.,
2012; Gasbarri et al., 1994b, 1997). Our results also confirm
recent studies using viral expression of channelrhodopsin in
Slc6a3ires-cre/+ mice that labeled relatively sparse dopaminergic
axons in the CA1 region (McNamara et al., 2014; Rosen et al.,
2015).
Despite the sparse innervation of the hippocampus by
midbrain dopaminergic axons, several lines of evidence indicate
a significant functional role for this dopaminergic innervation. It
was shown that nicotine can cause in vivo hippocampal long-
term synaptic plasticity, and this effect required local activation
of DA receptors (Tang and Dani, 2009). Inactivation of the VTA
with local infusion of TTX inhibited this effect, demonstrating
that the required dopamine signal originated, at least in part,
from the midbrain (Tang and Dani, 2009). In more recent studies,
researchers expressed channelrhodopsin-2 specifically in dopa-
minergic neurons in the VTA/SNc. Optical stimulation of these
dopaminergic fibers in the VTA or locally in the hippocampus in
mice exploring novel environments enhanced hippocampal
reactivation
and
improved
spatial
learning
and
memory
(McNamara et al., 2014). In addition, optogenetic release of
dopamine exclusively from the VTA was shown to cause a bidi-
rectional, activity-dependent modulation of Schaffer collateral
synapses in hippocampal slices (Rosen et al., 2015). Our data
are consistent with those findings, indicating the existence of
anatomical connectivity between midbrain dopamine centers
and the hippocampus.
Although DA neurons have been traditionally viewed to rein-
force rewarding behaviors and/or to signal the expectation of
reward, studies also have indicated that DA can influence the
persistence of aversive learning (Moncada et al., 2011; Ortiz
et al., 2010; Rossato et al., 2009). A population of ventral VTA
neurons located within the paranigral nucleus (PN) has been
shown to respond specifically to aversive stimuli within seconds
(Brischoux et al., 2009), resulting in increased DA in target areas
(Dong et al., 2010; Horvitz, 2000; Kienast et al., 2008). Anatomi-
cally, this subpopulation of DA neurons projects to the medial
prefrontal cortex and the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens
(Lammel et al., 2011, 2012). Interestingly, in an older retrograde
labeling study, it was shown that a population of TH-positive
neurons within the PN also connects to the hippocampus (Gas-
barri et al., 1994b).
D1-like Receptor Activity Enhanced Memory and
Plasticity in CA3-CA1 Synapses
Our data support that the synaptic plasticity associated with
aversive learning is dependent upon the temporal coincidence
of glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission. D1-like

 receptor inhibition after the behavioral training did not prevent
remembering the training that occurred just minutes before the
D1-like receptor inhibition. The 2-min window after training
was sufficient to allow DA to bind to D1 receptors to initiate the
mechanisms of LTP and memory retention. Activity initiated by
the D1-like receptors continued despite the later arrival of the
D1-like antagonist. Thus, synaptic potentiation and learning pro-
ceeded owing to the original initiation of these memory-related
processes before the antagonist arrived 2 min after the training
period.
An interesting concept was that D1-like receptor activity in the
CA1 was necessary for retention of long-term, but not short-term
IA memory. In the 1- to 3-hr time window, mice still avoided the
footshocked side even after D1-like receptors were inhibited
during training. Similarly, DA was important for long-term reten-
tion at 6 hr, but not at 20 min in a different behavioral task (O’Car-
roll et al., 2006), and a D1-like antagonist applied after training
did not affect memory consolidation (Rossato et al., 2009).
Shorter-term memory will likely involve different mechanisms
from longer-term memory that is consolidated over time, often
requiring periods of sleep. The hippocampal synaptic potentia-
tion indicated in vivo by the fEPSPs or ex vivo by the AMPA/
NMDA ratios correlated with the long-term memory tested 24–
72 hr later. In both cases (i.e., the in vivo fEPSP and ex vivo
AMPA/NMDA ratio), the indication of LTP was expressed as a
relatively global feature of the CA1 area we were studying.

the In Vivo fEPSP of the CA3-CA1 Circuit

of stimulating (left) and recording (right) electrodes
with white circles for walk-through controls and
black circles for IA recordings. All of the illustrated
sites indicate successful recordings that produced
stable input-output curves on all the recording
days and remained within the CA1 (Recording) and
Schaffer collateral (Stimulate) pathway.
(B) Representative traces from the CA1 taken from
mice recorded before (1) and after (2) IA training
(black lines) or walk-through controls (unshocked,
gray lines).
(C) Walk-through control mice that were exposed
to the experimental IA chamber but did not receive
footshock did not have a significant change in the
fEPSP slope (white circles, p > 0.05). Mice trained
in the IA paradigm showed a significant increase in
the fEPSP slope (p < 0.01). Following testing, the
fEPSP slope returned to baseline levels: controls,
IA both p > 0.05.
That is, different measures that in one
case averaged a broad area (in vivo
fEPSP) or in the other case picked individ-
ual CA1 pyramidal neurons (ex vivo
AMPA/NMDA ratio) both indicated the
presence of LTP. These results suggest
that to retain memory for 24–72 hr a high
percentage of a general area of the CA1
region was contributing: nearly every sin-
gle CA1 pyramidal neuron we studied had
an elevated AMPA/NMDA ratio. Because a large area and high
percentage of neurons were contributing, we were able to mea-
sure those diverse indications of LTP with our techniques. Even
under those successful circumstances, however, the in vivo
fEPSP rose slowly over approximately 30 min (see Figure 5C,
black data), suggesting an imperfect match between the learning
and presence of LTP as measured by the in vivo fEPSP.
When D1Rs were inhibited, in vivo the global fEPSP did not
change during IA training and the ex vivo slices did not show
LTP, and the memory was not observed at 24–72 hr. All of these
data to this point are consistent and easily understandable.
However, at early times after IA training with D1-like receptors in-
hibited, short-term memory was observed without global indica-
tions of LTP by fEPSPs or AMPA/NMDA ratios. That result may
be because without D1-like activity a high percentage of the dor-
sal CA1 is not contributing to the memory process needed to
retain information for days. However, smaller components of
the dorsal hippocampus (or other areas of the hippocampus or
brain) could be contributing to the short-term memory seen at
1–3 hr. Consistent with this speculation, for example, hippocam-
pal dopaminergic activity was shown to influence long-term but
not short-term memory retention in appetitive tasks (Bethus
et al., 2010). In the present experiments, DA was shown to be
important during the encoding phase of a long-term memory in
an aversive paradigm. Thus, DA neurotransmission within the
CA1 may serve to associate neutral spatial contexts with
1936

 unexpected unconditioned stimuli. This conclusion is consistent
with the hypothesis that DA signals under these circumstances
contribute to the updating of the rodent’s internal perception (or
map) of environmental saliency (Bethus et al., 2010; McNamara
et al., 2014).
Physiological evidence has indicated that dopaminergic
neurotransmission within the CA1 influences late phase LTP
(L-LTP), a phenomenon that requires protein synthesis and is
thought to be a molecular mechanism underlying mnemonic
consolidation in CA1 synapses (Frey et al., 1993; Huang et al.,
2013; Huang and Kandel, 1995; L€
uscher and Malenka, 2012).
L-LTP is typically produced by stimulating the Schaffer collat-
erals with high-frequency trains that increase the slope of the
fEPSP (Frey and Morris, 1997). The D1-like antagonist, SCH,
does not block early LTP produced by tetanization but does
block late phase LTP (Swanson-Park et al., 1999). In hippocam-
pal slice recordings, it has been shown that weaker stimulation
protocols can be enhanced by D1-like receptor activation and
blocked by D1-like receptor antagonists or catecholaminergic
depletion (Otmakhova and Lisman, 1996; Yang and Dani,
2014). The results support the hypothesis that D1/D5 neuro-
transmission is important for tagging synapses in the CA3-CA1
circuit for L-LTP (Frey and Morris, 1997; Lisman et al., 2011). In
the synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis, learning signals,
such as the novel IA context and subsequent association with
a footshock, could cause upregulation of plasticity proteins
that stabilizes learning-induced synaptic change (Frey and Mor-
ris, 1997, 1998). Our data indicate that aversive IA training pro-
duces broad synaptic plasticity in the CA3-CA1 synapses that
is strongly influenced by D1-like neurotransmission. Thus, DA
signaling within the hippocampus serves to consolidate the as-
sociation of a neutral context with aversive, unconditioned stim-
uli by contributing to the plasticity of the CA3-CA1 circuitry that
likely contributes to memory retention (McHugh et al., 2007;
Rumpel et al., 2005).
Conclusions
In summary, DA D1-like receptor activity modulates and regu-
lates hippocampal CA1 synaptic plasticity, associated learning,
and long-term memory arising from an aversive contextual
task. Although DA signaling from noradrenergic innervation
may contribute, dopaminergic innervation of the CA1 arises
from the VTA/SNc and b2 adrenergic signaling did not signifi-
cantly influence memory retention examined in our paradigms.
These results support the hypothesis that aversive events recruit
subpopulations of DA neurons (Brischoux et al., 2009; Henny
et al., 2012; Lammel et al., 2011, 2012, 2014) to contribute to
learning and memory.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
The methodology and reagents for immunohistochemistry, ex vivo electro-
physiology, surgery and in vivo electrophysiology, and statistical analysis are
described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Animals
Wild-type C57BL/6J mice 2–4 months old (Jackson Laboratory) had free
access to food and water and were housed in accordance with the guidelines
specified by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Baylor
College of Medicine or University of Pennsylvania and the Public Health Ser-
vice Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All animals
were maintained on a reverse light cycle with the lights off from 6 a.m. to 6
p.m., and all studies were conducted during the dark phase. For anatomy ex-
periments (Figures 1 and 2), Slc6a3ires-cre/+ mice were obtained from Jackson
Laboratory (stock #: 006660, which are commonly referred to as DATires-cre
mice).
Inhibitory Avoidance Behavioral Task
Mice were handled in the experimentation room for 3–4 days and habituated
to needle injections with saline before the start of the experiments, and all
experiments were conducted during the dark cycle. Prior to IA training, all
animals were injected i.p. with either saline, SCH 23390, SKF 82197, or
Tim. Training consisted of 40 s acclimatizing to the light chamber, and
then the trap door to the dark chamber was opened. Once mice walked
into the dark chamber, the trap door closed and the mice were given a single
footshock (2 s) followed by 2 min within the dark chamber before being re-
turned to their home cages. Footshock intensity was 0.8 mA unless other-
wise noted. After IA training, animals were tested for avoidance retention
at 1, 3, 24, or 72 hr or sacrificed for in vitro neurophysiological assays. IA
retention was assayed after training by replacing mice into the light side of
the chamber and measuring the latency before the animal returned to the
dark context side where the shock had been administered. The footshock
was not re-administered during the retention assay and measurements
