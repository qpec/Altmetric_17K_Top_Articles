Summary
 Background—Mortality within the first 6 months after initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
is common in resource-limited settings and is often due to tuberculosis (TB) among patients with 
advanced HIV disease. Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is recommended in HIV-infected adults, 
but sub-clinical TB can be difficult to diagnose. We hypothesized that empiric TB treatment would 
reduce early mortality compared to IPT in high-burden settings.
 Methods—We conducted a multi-country randomized clinical trial comparing empiric TB 
therapy (Empiric) vs. isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) in HIV-infected outpatients initiating 
ART with CD4 counts <50 cells/mm3. Individuals were screened for TB using a symptom screen, 
locally available diagnostics, and the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay when available. The primary 
endpoint was survival (death or unknown status) at 24 weeks post randomization. Kaplan Meier 
estimates of the endpoint rates across arms were compared by the z-test. Registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01380080).
 Findings—From October 31, 2011 until June 9, 2014, we randomized 850 participants (424 in 
Empiric arm and 426 in IPT arm); the median CD4 count at baseline was 18 cells/mm3 (IQR: 9, 
32). At week 24, each arm had 22 primary endpoints, for rates of 5.2% in each arm (95% CI: 3.5% 
to 7.8% for Empiric and 3.4% to 7.8% for IPT; absolute risk difference of -0.06% (95% CI: 
−3.05% to 2.94%). Grade 3 or 4 signs or symptoms occurred in 50 (12%) in the Empiric arm and 
46 (11%) in the IPT arm. Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities occurred in 99 (23%) in the 
Empiric arm and 97 (23%) in the IPT arm. Incident TB was more common in the Empiric arm (31 
vs. 18 events, p=0.01).

  Interpretation—Empiric TB therapy did not reduce mortality at 24 weeks in outpatient adults 
initiating ART with advanced HIV disease. The low mortality rate of the trial supports 
implementation of systematic TB screening and IPT in outpatients with advanced HIV disease.
 Introduction
Introduction and expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs have saved millions of 
lives among HIV-infected individuals in resource-limited settings1. Despite these successes, 
persons with advanced HIV disease continue to present for care and up to 17% of adults die 
in the initial months after ART initiation2. Risk factors for early mortality after ART 
initiation include a low CD4 cell count, low body mass index (BMI), and anemia, with those 
having a CD4<50 cells/mm3 having the highest risk of any individual factor2.
Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common cause of mortality in HIV-infected individuals and 
both prevalent and incident TB infections are a major contributor to early mortality among 
patients presenting to outpatient settings to initiate ART3. Up to 70% of patients with TB in 
sub-Saharan Africa are HIV-infected, and TB incidence rates following ART initiation are 
high, particularly among those with advanced HIV disease4, 5. Autopsy studies from sub-
Saharan Africa, South East Asia and the Americas confirm TB as the primary or 
contributing cause of mortality in the majority of cases with nearly half of the TB 
undiagnosed pre-mortem6. Strategies addressing TB in patients at high risk for early 
mortality across the globe are urgently needed.
Patients with HIV often lack classic symptoms and signs of TB, complicating diagnosis. The 
World Health Organization (WHO)-endorsed symptom screen for TB, based on cough, 
fever, weight loss and night sweats, misses two in ten TB cases in HIV-infected individuals7. 
In resource-limited settings where TB is common, patients with positive symptom screens 
are usually evaluated with sputum staining for acid fast bacilli (AFB), which has low 
sensitivity in HIV-infected individuals with low CD4 counts8. Likewise, patients with 
advanced HIV may have minimal changes on chest radiography. The GeneXpert MTB/RIF 
assay (Xpert MTB/RIF), has improved sensitivity in sputum9 but availability of this test 
remains limited10 and implementation of Xpert MTB/RIF alone has not decreased HIV and 
TB-associated mortality11–13. Limitations of existing diagnostics contribute to major 
ongoing challenges in diagnosing and treating HIV-associated TB in resource-limited 
settings.
Expanded use of empiric TB treatment, defined as treatment in absence of microbiologic 
confirmation of TB disease, has emerged as one potential approach to reduce TB-associated 
mortality. Currently, the WHO recommends that patients who screen negative for TB be 
placed on isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), and empiric TB therapy only be used for 
seriously ill patients in peripheral settings in whom initial tests are negative14. However, the 
optimal approach for managing patients at high risk of HIV-associated TB and early 
mortality after ART initiation is uncertain. Recent studies have provided further evidence 
indicating that IPT alone may substantially reduce the risk of TB-associated mortality in 
HIV15, but concerns about tolerability of IPT and promotion of drug-resistance in patients 
with sub-clinical TB have limited the uptake of this intervention. For patients with advanced

 immunosuppression, an alternative strategy relevant to high-burden settings would be to 
empirically treat TB in all severely immunosuppressed patients who are not found to have 
TB after screening, even if not seriously ill. This approach could decrease early mortality by 
addressing undiagnosed, untreated TB and, via rifampin, increasing durability of TB 
preventive therapy as well as treating or preventing severe bacterial infections. The 
REMEMBER (Reducing Early Mortality and Early Morbidity by Empiric Tuberculosis 
Treatment Regimens) study, AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Study A5274, 
hypothesized that empiric TB treatment will reduce early mortality compared to IPT among 
participants with advanced HIV disease presenting for ART initiation in settings where TB 
is common.
 Methods
 Study population
We enrolled HIV-infected ART-naïve individuals aged ≥13 years with CD4 counts <50 
cells/mm3 who did not have evidence of active TB (as per criteria described below) and who 
were eligible for either IPT or empiric TB treatment. All 18 sites reported a TB incidence 
>100/100,000 person years and had ART programs with documented high early mortality 
rates (>10–20 per 100 person years) among outpatient populations. Inclusion criteria 
included having liver function tests ≤2.5x the upper limit of normal, a creatinine clearance 
≥30mL/min, and a Karnofsky score ≥30 in order to facilitate inclusion of participants with 
advanced HIV presenting to ART clinics who were able to rapidly initiate both ART and TB 
treatment or IPT. To decrease the possible influence of HIV or TB drug resistance on 
outcomes, exclusion criteria included use of single dose nevirapine in the preceding 2 years, 
receipt of TB treatment or IPT within 96 and 48 weeks prior to study entry, respectively, and 
a history of household exposure to multidrug resistant (MDR)-TB. Full eligibility criteria are 
included in the study protocol (supplementary files).
Study sites generally followed local guidelines for ART initiation in their country programs. 
All 18 sites initiated ART for WHO stage 3 or 4 disease for those with CD4 counts < 350 
cells/mm3. For standard of care TB screening, all 18 sites reported using sputum AFB 
screening and chest radiography, and 5 reported implementation of the Xpert MTB/RIF 
assay.
 Study design
We compared 2 treatment strategies: ART + empiric TB therapy (Empiric arm) vs. ART+ 
IPT (IPT arm) in an open-label randomized 1:1 trial design. Randomization sequence was 
generated by a computer at the ACTG Data Management Center. Randomization was 
balanced by clinical trial unit and stratified according to CD4+ T cell count (<25 vs. ≥25 
cells/mm3) and presence of any of the following prognostic factors: reportable 
hospitalization within the past 30 days, BMI <18.5 kg/m2, or anemia (hemoglobin <8 g/dl). 
Participants, site personnel, and study statisticians were not masked to group assignment. 
The open label pragmatic design was chosen to reflect actual field settings where ART 
would be combined with either Empiric 4 drug therapy or IPT.

 Potential participants were referred to study clinics from local ART clinics, many of which 
were co-located and some of which were fully integrated within the ART program. At the 
study clinics, potential participants were screened for TB prior to study entry using a 
symptom screen that included the following: cough ≥2 weeks, any current fever >38°C, 
hemoptysis, night sweats within the past 2 weeks, unintentional weight loss >10% in the 
past 30 days, or enlarged axillary or cervical lymph nodes. Any positive screen required 
further workup per local standard of care. All sites had capacity to perform AFB smear, 
chest radiograph, ultrasound, mycobacterial culture, and Gene Xpert, however the use of 
specific tests was left up to the site’s clinicians. Persons who were strongly suspected to 
have TB, or for whom screening procedures identified confirmed or probable TB were 
excluded. The study did not collect information on the outcomes of persons excluded from 
study entry. In response to a June 2013 Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review, the 
protocol was modified to require the addition of sputum Xpert MTB/RIF assay testing for all 
potential participants during screening. Participants with negative symptom screens or 
positive screens but no microbiologic or presumptive diagnosis of TB were eligible for 
enrollment in the study.
All participants received efavirenz-containing ART with either study-provided tenofovir/
emtricitibine (Truvada®; donated by Gilead) or locally available nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors. Participants in the Empiric arm received self-administered, weight-
adjusted fixed-dose combination rifampin/isoniazid/ethambutol/ pyrazinamide for 8 weeks, 
followed by fixed-dose combination rifampin/isoniazid for 16 weeks, beginning within 7 
days after ART initiation. Participants in the IPT arm received 300mg of isoniazid daily for 
24 weeks, beginning within 7 days of ART. All participants received pyridoxine. Participants 
are followed for 96 weeks; results through week 24 are reported here. Participants attended 
study visits at screening, enrollment, and weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. Signs and 
symptoms, ART modifications, concomitant medications, and clinical events as defined by 
AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Appendix 60 were collected at each visit. Blood was 
collected for CD4 and HIV-1 RNA at study entry, weeks 4 and 24, and blood for safety 
laboratories (liver function, hematology, and renal function) was collected at all visits except 
week 1. A sputum sample was collected and stored at study entry. After the DSMB review 
requiring real time Xpert MTB/RIF testing, the available stored samples collected prior to 
this requirement were retrospectively tested using the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Participants in 
both arms who developed signs or symptoms of TB had TB investigations performed as per 
locally available diagnostics, which included sputum culture and, for those with positive 
cultures, drug susceptibility testing. Those with drug-sensitive TB received weight-adjusted 
fixed-dose combination rifampin/isoniazid/ethambutol/ pyrazinamide for 8 weeks, followed 
by fixed-dose combination rifampin/isoniazid for 16 weeks. Any participant with drug 
resistant TB was treated according to local standard of care. In the event of missed visits, 
participants were traced by phone calls and home visits if they or their contacts could not be 
reached by phone. Those who could not be contacted after this process were defined as lost 
to follow-up.

  Study oversight
The study was funded by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) 
through the ACTG. An NIAID international DSMB monitored the study semi-annually. 
Sites obtained approval from local ethics committees. Participants had to provide written 
informed consent.
 Statistical analysis
The primary endpoint was survival (death or unknown vital status) 24 weeks post 
randomization. The target sample size of 836 was selected to detect a 7.5% difference in the 
primary event probabilities (15% for IPT and 7.5% for Empiric) between arms based on a 
two-sided test of binomial probabilities with 90% power, 5% alpha level, and 5% inflation of 
the estimated sample size for interim analyses. For the primary endpoint analysis, an intent-
to-treat (ITT) approach was used with all randomized participants regardless of receiving 
treatment, except for one participant who was enrolled inadvertently due to an incorrect CD4 
count at screening (n=850). The final analysis was conducted with a significance level of 5% 
which does not account for the number of interim analyses since the original sample size 
was inflated by 5% for the interim analyses. On and off study deaths and participants with 
unknown survival status were included as events in the primary endpoint analysis. Kaplan 
Meier estimates of the endpoint probabilities across arms were compared by the z-test. 
Participants who withdrew consent (n=8) were censored at the time of their last visit. 
Secondary endpoints included death and AIDS progression, confirmed or probable TB, 
grade 3 or 4 signs/symptoms, and grade 3 or 4 lab abnormalities. AIDS progression was 
defined as any new WHO stage 3 or 4 event occurring greater than 2 weeks after study entry. 
Incident TB was defined as any diagnosis occurring after entry. Similar methods were used 
to compare the secondary endpoint probabilities of death or AIDS progression, and 
confirmed or probable TB between arms. Time to any primary and secondary endpoint was 
compared by the log-rank test. For the supplemental analyses, a per-protocol approach was 
used with all participants who completed the 24 week assessments (n=842). The Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel test was used to compare the primary endpoint probabilities between arms 
after stratification by randomization phase (before and after implementation of screening 
Xpert MTB/RIF testing) and by the prognostic stratification factors described above. 
Additionally, we evaluated the impact of excluding any participants with a positive 
enrollment sputum Xpert MTB/RIF sample as determined by retrospective testing. For the 
safety analysis, all randomized participants were included (n=851) and Chi-square test was 
used to compare the probabilities of safety and tolerability of ART and TB treatment. Safety 
outcomes included all signs, symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities meeting Grade 3 or 4 
criteria per the Division of AIDS toxicity table. All causes of death, AIDS progression 
events, and TB cases were externally verified. All analyses were conducted in SAS Version 
9.4. This study is registered in ClincalTrial.gov as trial number NCT01380080.
 Results
 Patient characteristics
From October 31, 2011 until June 9, 2014, a total of 1368 candidates were screened and 851 
(62%) were randomized (Figure 1.a.). One participant who was randomized to the IPT arm

 was later found to be ineligible and was discontinued at day 10 due to having a screening 
CD4 count value ≥ 50 cells/mm3. Participants were enrolled at 18 sites in 10 countries 
(Malawi, South Africa, Haiti, Kenya, Zambia, India, Brazil, Zimbabwe, Peru, and Uganda), 
with 77% (n=658) of the enrollment occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa. The most common 
screening failure reason was having a CD4 count value ≥ 50 cells/mm3 (n=192; 33%), 
followed by presence of suspected or confirmed TB (n=183; 32%) and having laboratory 
values out of range (n=86; 15%). Patients who were not enrolled were slightly more likely to 
have AFB smear, ultrasound, and culture performed at screening compared to those who 
were enrolled (Figure 1.b.). Among screening failures, the number excluded due to TB 
suspicion varied across sites 0% in Eldoret (Kenya) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) to 56% 
(n=10) in Port-au-Prince (Haiti). Overall, 10/18 sites excluded >30% of screen failures due 
to confirmed or probable TB. Among participants screened for the study, 98% (n=1247) had 
protocol mandated symptom screening, chest radiograph was performed in 61% (n=779), 
sputum AFB smear in 44% (n=562), culture in 20% (n=259), and other diagnostics in 6% 
(n=77). Of those screened, 26 patients were excluded because of a positive Xpert MTB/RIF 
assay. Among those enrolled, approximately 85% could produce sputum at baseline.
Baseline characteristics of 850 enrolled participants (424 in Empiric arm and 426 in IPT 
arm) were similar across arms (Table 1). Overall, 53% (n=450) were male, 90% (n=768) 
were black; median (IQR, range) age was 36 (30–42, 18–70) years. Participants had highly 
advanced HIV disease with a median (IQR) CD4 count of 18 cells/mm3 (9–32). Forty-two 
(5%) had reportable hospitalization within 30 days before study entry, 248 (29%) had a BMI 
less than 18.5 kg/m2, and 44 (5%) had a hemoglobin less than 8 g/dL. Of 448 (53%) who 
were enrolled prior to required sputum Xpert MTB/RIF assay screening, 379 (45%) had 
retrospective testing using Xpert MTB/RIF and 6 (2%) were positive, 3 in each arm. Among 
the 850 enrolled participants, 502 (59%) had at least one positive result on symptom screen 
prior to enrollment in the trial, with unintentional weight loss being the most commonly 
reported symptom (among 415, or 49%), followed by cough > 2 weeks (reported by 139, or 
16%) (Table 1).
 Primary Outcome
At week 24, both arms had 22 primary events resulting in the same primary endpoint rate of 
5.2% (95% CI: 3.5% to 7.8% for Empiric arm and 3.4% to 7.8% for IPT arm; p-value = 
0.97) and resulting in an absolute risk difference of −0.06% (95% CI: −3.05% to 2.94%). All 
primary endpoints were deaths except for 2 unknown vital status events in the Empiric arm. 
The death rates between the study arms remained not significantly different after treating the 
two participants as censored cases in sensitivity analysis (n=20, 4.8% for the Empiric arm 
and n=22, 5.2% for the IPT arm; p-value = 0.78). Among the 10 countries with at least one 
site, eight reported at least one death and the primary endpoint rates by arm were generally 
similar across countries. While mortality was higher among those with a CD4 count <25 
cells/mm3 and those with poor prognostic factors, the event rates were similar across arms 
for the stratification factors as well as before and after implementation of sputum Xpert 
MTB/RIF testing or after excluding participants with retrospectively identified positive 
sputum Xpert MTB/RIF tests (Table 2). There was no difference in time to the primary event 
across arms (Figure 2.a).

 Causes of death included HIV-associated infections (17 in Empiric arm, 11 in IPT arm), 
non-HIV diagnoses (5 in IPT arm), renal toxicity attributed to tenofovir (1 in IPT arm), 
unknown in 6 cases (2 in Empiric arm, 4 in IPT arm), and motor vehicle accident (1 in the 
IPT arm) (supplemental Table 1). Cryptococcal meningitis (4), Kaposi’s sarcoma (3), and 
extrapulmonary TB (3) were the most common HIV-associated causes of death.
 Secondary Outcomes
By week 24, the Empiric arm had a higher rate of death or AIDS progression (17.1% (n=72) 
vs. 12.5% (n=53); p=0.06) and the time to death or AIDS progression was more rapid in the 
Empiric arm (Figure 2.b). The result was due primarily to an increased incidence of TB (31 
and 18 participants in the Empiric and IPT arms, respectively p=0.01), including both 
pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease (supplemental Table 2). The time to confirmed or 
probable TB in the Empiric arm was also more rapid (Figure 2.c). There was no difference 
in time to death or AIDS progression if confirmed or probable TB was excluded (Figure 
2.d). Self-reported adherence to study medications was similar across arms at all weeks 
except the Empiric arm had lower reported 100% adherence to TB drugs at week 8 (88% 
(n=360) vs. 93% (n=383) , p=0.03). The Empiric arm also experienced more premature 
discontinuations of TB drugs by week 24 (47 Empiric vs. 18 IPT discontinuations). A viral 
load <400 copies/mL was achieved by 84% (n=309) and 85% (n=322) of participants in the 
Empiric and IPT arms, respectively. The median CD4 change at 24 weeks was 96 (IQR: 55–
147) in the Empiric arm and 102 (IQR: 60–159) in the IPT arm (p=0.25 by Wilcoxon test).
Safety measures were also similar across arms. Grade 3 or 4 signs or symptoms occurred in 
50 (12%) in the Empiric arm and 46 (11%) in the IPT arm. Grade 3 or 4 laboratory 
abnormalities occurred in 23% (n=99 and 97 for Empiric and IPT, respectively) in both arms 
(Table 4). Hematology abnormalities were most common, occurring in 15% (n=124) overall 
(15% (n=65) in Empiric arm, 14% (n=59) in IPT arm) followed by hepatic abnormalities, 
occurring in 6% (n=55) overall (6% (n=26 ) in Empiric arm, 7% (n=29) in IPT arm). Of the 
49 incident cases of TB, there was no evidence of differential increased drug resistance by 
study arm. Drug resistance to at least one TB drug occurred in 6 participants, 3 in each arm. 
In the Empiric arm, the resistance profiles of the 3 participants were Isoniazid/ethambutol, 
isoniazid/rifampin/ethambutol, and Streptomycin /rifampin/isoniazid/ethambutol while in 
the IPT arm, the resistance profiles of the 3 participants were isoniazid only, Streptomycin /
rifampin/isoniazid/ethambutol, and Streptomycin /rifampin/isoniazid/ethambutol/
pyrazinamide. The participants switched to appropriate TB treatment per local guidelines 
after the resistance was identified.
Despite potential benefits of rifampin on severe bacterial infections, the incidence of such 
infections did not differ significantly by arm [37 (9%) for the Empiric arm and 52 (12%) for 
the IPT arm; p-value = 0.095; Supplemental Table 2)]. TB-immune reconstitution 
inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) was adjudicated using ACTG definitions by the external 
endpoint panel. A total of 19 TB-IRIS cases (2%) were reported (9 in the Empiric arm and 
10 in the IPT arm). Of these 19 cases, 13 were confirmed ART ‘unmasking’ TB-associated 
TB-IRIS (6 in the Empiric arm and 7 in the IPT arm), and 5 were probable ART

 ‘unmasking’ TB-associated TB-IRIS (2 in the Empiric arm and 3 in the IPT arm), and 1 was 
probable paradoxical TB-associated TB-IRIS (in the Empiric arm).
 Discussion
In this large, multi-site randomized clinical trial, empiric TB therapy did not reduce early 
mortality compared to administration of IPT in individuals with highly advanced HIV 
disease initiating ART in outpatient settings where TB incidence is high. Furthermore, 
despite enrolling participants with extremely low CD4 cell counts, we observed a mortality 
rate that was substantially lower than that observed in previous studies from similar 
settings2. We also observed an increased risk of AIDS progression and specifically TB in the 
Empiric arm. Taken together, the results support the use of standardized TB screening 
procedures in patients with advanced HIV disease presenting for ART initiation and indicate 
that, in those without a diagnosis of TB after screening, there is no added benefit of empiric 
TB therapy compared to provision of IPT alone. Indeed, this study effectively demonstrates 
that the combination of IPT with ART is safe when used to prevent TB and early mortality 
in very advanced HIV disease.
We had hypothesized that empiric TB therapy would more effectively treat those with 
subclinical active TB and thereby reduce early mortality. Numerous studies done pre- and 
post-mortem have identified TB as the major cause of mortality in those with advanced HIV 
disease who are initiating ART in sub-Saharan Africa, India, Haiti and parts of South 
America, where our study took place2, 6. An additional hypothesized effect of empiric TB 
therapy relates to a potentially more durable TB preventive impact of isoniazid and rifampin 
compared to isoniazid alone16. Lastly, by virtue of the use of rifampin, empiric TB treatment 
could also plausibly provide benefit in terms of prevention or early treatment of severe 
bacterial infections. However, we found a definitive lack of benefit of empiric therapy on 
mortality outcomes. This finding likely resulted in part from the exclusion of many TB cases 
by the study’s systematic TB screening approach, as one-third of screened participants were 
excluded for suspected active TB. Furthermore, although the median CD4 count of the study 
population was extremely low, systematic non-referral of sicker patients or those with very 
high TB suspicion to the study may have resulted in exclusion of candidates with poor 
prognosis. Interestingly, our study still encountered substantial incident TB but we also 
observed that fewer participants diagnosed with TB after ART initiation died during 24 
weeks of follow-up across both arms. This contrasts sharply with the strong association 
previously observed between prevalent and incident TB after ART initiation and early 
mortality among HIV-infected outpatients initiating ART3, 17. This lower mortality is 
notable, given the highly advanced HIV disease of the cohort, but provides solid evidence 
that empiric TB therapy does not provide a mortality benefit over IPT even among 
outpatients with profound immunosuppression who remain without a TB diagnosis after 
screening.
Other observational studies and clinical trials have documented early mortality rates of 15% 
or higher2, 18, 19 which is substantially greater than the 5% documented in this study. In 
addition to possible effects of screening and referral patterns mentioned above, this low 
mortality rate may also relate to the fact that all participants received INH, a rapidly

 bactericidal agent20 which can reduce the risk of TB in HIV-infected patients21–23. Although 
INH’s effect on survival is uncertain in patients with severe HIV immunosuppression, two 
observational studies from South Africa and a cluster-randomized trial in Brazil found that 
IPT reduced early mortality and incidence of a combined endpoint of TB and mortality in 
HIV-infected individuals24–26. More recently, the TEMPRANO study, a randomized, 2 x 2 
factorial designed clinical trial evaluating ART and IPT in adults with median baseline CD4 
count of approximately 460 cells/mmm3, found that IPT resulted in a 35% reduction in 
severe HIV morbidity15. To date, no other trial including IPT and ART initiation among 
HIV-infected individuals has examined a similarly large population of individuals with 
highly advanced HIV disease. This distinguishing characteristic of the A5274 trial is 
important, because although IPT is recommended by WHO for HIV-infected adults, its 
uptake and implementation has been very low due in part to concerns about excluding active 
TB in advanced HIV disease, and associated fears of generating drug resistance. Deferring 
IPT for some months among advanced patients has been proposed to address any potential 
resistance risk associated with early incident TB27. However, while the number of incident 
TB cases in this study limits formal analyses of isoniazid resistance, the prescribed 6-month 
course of IPT was well tolerated and discontinuations were rare when initiated near the time 
of ART initiation. Thus, while our study did not include a placebo arm, these results indicate 
that IPT plus ART can be safely implemented in patients with highly advanced HIV disease 
who are not diagnosed with TB after screening. This is in keeping with the WHO’s latest 
guidance to provide IPT regardless of CD4 count for all HIV-infected adults and 
adolescents14. Repeated symptom screening for TB at follow-up visits after IPT initiation, 
also recommended by WHO14, should also be implemented to detect incident TB as early as 
possible on ART.
The increased risk of AIDS progression and specifically TB seen in the Empiric arm was 
unexpected. Provision of 4-drug TB therapy to patients without a known TB diagnosis 
plausibly could lead to adverse events and reduced adherence to anti-tubercular therapy or 
ART, either of which could result in an increased risk of AIDS progression. Although self-
reported adherence to TB therapy and ART, as well as virologic and immunologic responses 
to ART, were similar across arms for all visits except week 8, premature TB drug 
discontinuation rates were more common in the Empiric arm. A previous study has 
suggested that the combination of isoniazid/rifampin may have more potent and durable 
protection against the development of TB and death than isoniazid alone, but multi-drug 
regimens for treatment of latent TB infection are also associated with increased risk of 
discontinuation21. Another potential explanation for the increased rate of TB in the empiric 
arm is diagnostic suspicion bias, where knowledge of TB treatment status led to more 
aggressive use of TB diagnostics or more liberal TB diagnosis in participants randomized to 
the Empiric arm. Unmasking TB-IRIS was also uncommon in both arms and does not 
appear to explain this difference in incident TB. Nonetheless, given the lack of clinical 
benefit of the empiric therapy, the finding of potential harm should be carefully considered 
by providers when evaluating similar patient populations.
Notably our study population of adults with advanced HIV (CD4<50 cells/mm3) disease 
continues to be encountered in HIV programs globally despite the evolving guidance to start 
ART at higher CD4 cell counts. Currently, the median CD4 count in ART programs in low-

 and middle-income settings remains below 200 cells/mm3, 28. This low CD4 population is 
the group at highest risk of developing and dying from TB. By focusing on individuals with 
advanced HIV disease, our study provides valuable evidence that systematic screening for 
TB using standard measures that may or may not include Gene Xpert may enable safe and 
effective initiation of IPT and ART together in settings with a high burden of HIV and TB.
Our study has some limitations. Study treatment was not blinded to providers or participants 
such that knowledge of study arm could both influence patient acceptance of a multi-drug 
combination treatment or providers’ diagnostic suspicion for TB. However, the unblinded 
approach enabled a pragmatic assessment of how this treatment strategy might work in non-
trial settings, where participants without TB after screening would be asked to initiate four-
drug TB therapy. The conduct of the study in multiple sites where early mortality rates are 
high and TB is endemic is a major strength, but the results may not be generalizable to 
settings where systematic TB screening is not performed or where limited resources prevent 
close follow-up and early TB diagnosis after ART initiation. In addition, the results from this 
study among outpatients initiating ART may be not be generalizable to sicker inpatient 
populations with higher mortality rates, where the prevalence of TB at autopsy has 
approached 50%6. However, randomized trials of empiric TB therapy in highly advanced 
patients in inpatient settings would address a different research question, and may have 
different concerns regarding equipoise. Another limitation was that we did not collect data 
on all eligible patients who could have potentially enrolled but who were not referred to the 
trial, limiting our ability to place this strategy in a broader context of care. Nonetheless, 
similarly low mortality rates may be achievable in routine care settings, given that the 
study’s screening methods and follow-up schedule were based largely on WHO and local 
treatment guidelines14. Importantly, while many settings may not have universal access to 
the Xpert MTB/RIF assay, mortality rates in this study were similar before and after 
mandatory sputum Xpert MTB/RIF testing at screening was implemented and after 
excluding TB cases identified retrospectively using the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. This result is 
consistent with data indicating that the use of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay may not reduce 
mortality in patients with HIV11–13. Furthermore, the rationale for empiric TB therapy is 
based primarily on high rates of undiagnosed TB in patients presenting for care, which in 
part depends upon the availability of accurate TB diagnostics and assessments performed 
prior to ART initiation, along the entire cascade of HIV care. Novel TB diagnostics such as 
the urinary lipoarabinomannan (LAM) assay, which has approximately 67% sensitivity in 
patients with CD4 counts <50 cells/mm3 29, has recently been shown to reduce mortality as 
well as the use of empiric TB treatment among hospitalized patients when used as an 
additional diagnostic test30 and may decrease the rationale for empiric TB therapy.
In summary, our study found that empiric TB treatment did not reduce early mortality in 
outpatients with advanced HIV disease compared to provision of IPT. Among patients with 
advanced HIV disease in settings where TB incidence is high, systematic TB screening prior 
to ART initiation and implementation of IPT near the time of ART initiation should be 
urgently pursued.

 Research in Context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles published up to February 9th, 2016, in any language, 
that used a randomized trial design to test the hypothesis that empirically treating HIV-
infected individuals with TB treatment who did not have clinical or microbiologic 
evidence of TB disease would reduce early mortality after antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
initiation using the search terms: “HIV-1”, “tuberculosis”, “mortality”, “antiretroviral 
therapy”, “empiric therapy”, and “randomized trial”. No published randomized trials of 
empiric TB therapy were identified. Management of HIV and TB co-infection is a 
longstanding challenge with respect to morbidity, mortality and disease prevention and 
control programs. A major issue relates to the complexity of adequately detecting TB in 
patients with advanced HIV disease who are presenting for antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
initiation. These patients are at very high risk of TB-associated morbidity and mortality 
but tests commonly used for TB diagnosis in resource-limited settings, including sputum 
staining for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), have low sensitivity in these individuals. 
Furthermore, autopsy studies reveal that TB is the major cause of HIV-associated 
mortality in these settings. Thus, high rates of mortality within ART programs in 
resource-limited settings, particularly among those with advanced HIV disease, have 
been largely attributed to under-diagnosed TB. Strategies to reduce mortality in this 
vulnerable population are urgently needed.
WHO guidelines currently advocate use of symptom screening and IPT for 6 to 36 
months in HIV-infected individuals in whom TB is not found after screening. However, 
IPT is poorly implemented in most settings due in part to data showing that patients with 
HIV/TB may have minimal symptoms, which could result in treating patients with sub-
clinical TB with a single drug. Additionally, while the WHO recommends the Cepheid 
GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Xpert MTB/RIF) assay as a diagnostic tool to improve 
identification of TB and TB drug resistance in HIV-associated TB, availability remains 
limited and implementation of the test has not been associated with reduced mortality in 
randomized trials to date. Empiric TB treatment, based on clinical symptoms without 
microbiologic confirmation in those at high risk of TB and death, is an alternative 
approach to managing these patients and has been recommended for study by the WHO. 
At the time of study inception, however, no randomized studies had evaluated this 
strategy for reducing early ART mortality among HIV-infected outpatients presenting for 
ART initiation.
Three clinical trials evaluating empiric TB therapy have been implemented and are 
ongoing. These include 1) the Systematic Empirical vs. Test-guided Anti-TB Treatment 
Impact in Severely Immunosuppressed HIV-infected Adults Initiating ART With CD4 
Cell Counts <100/mm3 (STATIS; NCT020577); 2) the TB Fast Track Study 
(ISRCTN35344604) and 3) ACTG A5274, Reducing Early Mortality and Early 
Morbidity by Empiric Tuberculosis Treatment (REMEMBER), of which the 24-week 
results are presented here. While the design of each of these studies is different, all 
include HIV-infected populations at high risk for early mortality and use of empiric TB 
treatment. The REMEMBER study addresses the question of whether outpatients with

 advanced HIV disease who are not diagnosed with TB after screening using existing 
methodologies should be empirically treated for TB or started on IPT as recommended 
by WHO. A5274/REMEMBER is the only randomized empiric TB treatment trial that 
includes an IPT arm.
Added value of this study
REMEMBER is the first completed clinical trial that addresses whether outpatients with 
advanced HIV disease living in settings with a high burden of TB who screen negative for 
TB should initiate IPT or be treated empirically for TB. The study was performed at 18 
diverse sites in 10 countries that likely reflect conditions encountered by clinicians 
attempting to diagnose and treat TB in patients with advanced HIV disease in resource-
limited settings. We found no beneficial effect of empiric treatment on mortality. Overall, 
the mortality rate in the study was lower than what ART programs have reported in 
observational studies, likely reflecting the clinical trial care setting. There was a 
suggestion of possible harm in the empiric arm with respect to incident TB and HIV 
disease progression. IPT was safe and well-tolerated.
Implications of all the available evidence
In settings where routine symptom screening is conducted among outpatients presenting 
to initiate ART, diagnostics are accessible, and close follow-up is possible, there is no 
benefit to empiric TB treatment over the current WHO recommendation of the use of 
IPT. Additionally, this trial demonstrates that IPT can be safely given to HIV-infected 
individuals with advanced disease. The results strongly suggest that ART programs 
should enhance routine TB symptom screening and implementation of IPT, even for 
individuals with low CD4 counts.
