Abstract
Background: Transmasculine individuals are people who were assigned as female at birth, but identify on the male
side of the gender spectrum. They might choose to use and engage their bodies to be pregnant, birth a baby, and
chestfeed. This study asked an open research question, “What are the experiences of transmasculine individuals
with pregnancy, birthing, and feeding their newborns?”
Methods: Participants who self-identified as transmasculine and had experienced or were experiencing pregnancy,
birth, and infant feeding were recruited through the internet and interviewed. Interviews were transcribed verbatim.
We used interpretive description methodology to analyze the data. Our analysis was guided by our awareness of
concepts and history important to the transgender community.
Results: Out of 22 participants, 16 chose to chestfeed for some period of time, four participants did not attempt
chestfeeding, and two had not reached the point of infant feeding (i.e., were still pregnant or had a miscarriage).
Nine of the 22 study participants had chest masculinization surgery before conceiving their babies. Six participants
had the surgery after their children were born, five desired the surgery in the future, and two did not want it at all.
Chest care, lactation, and chestfeeding in the context of being a transgender person are reported in this paper. The
participants’ experiences of gender dysphoria, chest masculinization surgery before pregnancy or after weaning,
accessing lactation care as a transmasculine person, and the question of restarting testosterone emerged as data.
We present the participants’ experiences in a chronological pattern with the categories of before pregnancy,
pregnancy, postpartum (6 weeks post birth), and later stage (beyond 6 weeks).
Conclusions: The majority of participants chose to chestfeed while some did not due to physical or mental health
reasons. Care providers should communicate an understanding of gender dysphoria and transgender identities in
order to build patient trust and provide competent care. Further, health care providers need to be knowledgeable
about lactation and chest care following chest masculinization surgery and during binding, regardless of the
chosen feeding method and through all stages: before pregnancy, during pregnancy, postpartum, and afterward.

 Background
Introduction and purpose
Transmasculine individuals are people who were assigned
as female at birth, but identify on the male side of the gen-
der spectrum. Their anatomical birth sex does not match
their inner sense of gender identity. This incongruity may
be a source of gender dysphoria, the experience of distress
or anxiety regarding one’s gender and body. To transition is
to make a change in one’s public gender identity, whereas
one’s inner gender identity may have been the same since
birth. Transitioning may encompass changes in name and
clothing choices; using testosterone; or having surgical pro-
cedures related to the chest or reproductive organs. The
gender binary is the assumption that there are two distinct
and opposite genders, rather than a gender spectrum [1, 2].
Taking testosterone results in changes to secondary
sex characteristics such as increased muscle mass, fat re-
distribution, growth of facial hair, male-pattern baldness,
and deepening of the voice, and it usually causes the
cessation of menses [3–5], though some transmasculine
individuals may become pregnant while taking testoster-
one [5]. For some individuals, some of these body changes
are permanent [3, 4]. Cessation of testosterone therapy
can result in the return of menses and fertility [3].
Some transmasculine individuals choose to engage
their bodies to carry a pregnancy and birth a baby. They
also make choices about how they will feed their newborns.
Whether they have taken steps to transition medically or
surgically and whether or not they choose to chestfeed their
babies, these individuals may require assistance from lacta-
tion professionals.
We asked the question, “What are the experiences of
transmasculine individuals with pregnancy, birthing, and
feeding their newborns?” We interviewed 22 individuals
who self-identified as transmasculine and who had expe-
rienced pregnancy, birth, and infant feeding, or were
currently experiencing pregnancy and planning for birth
and infant feeding. Based on findings from the research
study, the purposes of this paper are: 1) to describe
transmasculine individuals’ experiences with their chests,
lactation, and chestfeeding; 2) to inform transmasculine
individuals who might want to chestfeed their babies;
and 3) to guide health care professionals (e.g., lactation
consultants, midwives, nurses, physicians, and surgeons)
who provide breast and chest care. We report our re-
search findings regarding pregnancy and birth in a
separate paper.
Inclusive language
Language, both written and spoken, has power. Words
can heal or wound, uplift or disparage. During the inter-
views, participants expressed the importance of words
related to gender. Being described with words such as
she, her, mom, mum, mother, breasts, or breastfeeding
could be distressing for a parent who self-identifies dif-
ferently. A finding of this paper is that health care pro-
viders (HPCs) and others may inadvertently cause harm
and intensify feelings of gender dysphoria by misgender-
ing transmasculine patients. Conversely, care providers
can affirm a patient’s gender identity by gendering them
correctly, and thus alleviate distress related to gender
dysphoria. To uphold the importance of using respectful
and appropriate language, inclusive and gender-neutral
terms are used in this work. In order to be inclusive of
all gender identities, we use the pronouns they, them,
and their to refer to an individual when appropriate, as
opposed to limiting these pronouns to plural use.
Of the 22 participants, 20 participants said they pre-
ferred male pronouns and two preferred neutral pro-
nouns or both “he” and “she.” All participants referred
to their upper front torso as their chest and avoided the
term breasts. However, two participants spoke of their
breasts when they described what it was like to breast-
feed their babies much earlier in their lives, before they
had come out as transgender. In general, in this paper,
the term chest is used to refer to the upper front torso,
which includes the nipples and surrounding skin, mam-
mary tissue, and fatty tissue.
Study participants used a range of terminology to dis-
cuss feeding their babies from their chests. Six used the
term breastfeeding, four spoke of nursing, three pre-
ferred to say chestfeeding, two used both breastfeeding
and nursing, two said it did not matter, one used feeding
and nursing, and one used feeding and mammal feeding.
In this paper, the term chestfeeding is used to refer to
transmasculine or gender non-conforming individuals
and the act of feeding a baby or child at the chest with
or without a supplementing tube. We use breastfeeding
with regard to research or settings that are not inclusive
of transgender or gender non-conforming individuals.
Breastfeeding is not exclusive to cisgender women (i.e.,
women whose gender identity and gender expression
conform to the gender that is typically associated with
their birth-assigned sex) who gave birth and are lactat-
ing. Transmasculine individuals also lactate and chest-
feed babies they have birthed. Individuals sometimes
induce lactation or relactate to feed babies and children
they did not birth. In some cases, a supplementing tube
provides nourishment while breastfeeding or chestfeed-
ing. A supplementer could be used by women, transmas-
culine individuals, or gender non-conforming persons
who have given birth, are lactating, and need to supple-
ment, or by individuals who chose to relactate or induce
lactation to breastfeed or chestfeed a baby or child.
Literature review
When it comes to building knowledge about health care,
transgender issues are often folded into discussions about
MacDonald et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2016) 16:106 
Page 2 of 17
 gay, lesbian, and bisexual health rather than treated separ-
ately [6–8]. The research literature from the past 10 years
specific to transgender health consists primarily of general
health needs assessments and research studies [9–11].
However, physicians and nurses have begun to contribute
with wide-ranging topics such as identifying physician-
side barriers to providing healthcare for transgender
patients; curriculum recommendations for health care
students; and analyses about gendered language, the
invisibility of transgender diversity, and transgender pa-
tients’ avoidance of emergency care [12–17].
There are a few journal articles about transgender
men and gynecological care [18, 19]. Dutton and Fennie
interviewed six transgender men to determine their
gynecological needs [19]. In their qualitative study,
breasts were identified as causing significant discomfort
relating to gender dysphoria [19]. Dutton and Fennie
recommended that clinicians should encourage clients
to asexualize the breasts [19], although it is unclear how
this strategy might be implemented.
There are commentaries and research about trans-
gender individuals’ experiences of pregnancy and birth
[20–22], yet we found little in the academic literature
specifically about transmasculine individuals and chest-
feeding, with the exception of two papers published in
2015. Farrow wrote a commentary about lactation sup-
port and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer,
questioning, and intersex community
that included
transgender men and infant feeding [23]. Wolfe-Roubatis
and Spatz presented three cases and summarized strat-
egies to provide support for transgender men who are lac-
tating [24]. While commentaries and practical suggestions
bring the topic to the attention of health care providers,
there is a lack of research about transmasculine individ-
uals’ experiences with chestfeeding. With this paper, we
aim to begin to establish a body of knowledge about trans-
masculine individuals and their experiences of lactation
and chestfeeding.
Methods
Study design
Because of the current lack of research on this topic, we
chose a broad research question: “What are the experiences
of transmasculine individuals with pregnancy, birth, and
infant feeding?” We used a qualitative methodology to
design this study and interpretive description methodology
to analyze the data. According to Thorne et al., “interpretive
description acknowledges the constructed and contextual
nature of human experience that at the same time allows
for shared realities” [25] (p. 172). We wanted to learn about
the study participants’ choices and experiences with infant
feeding. The research was designed as semi-structured in-
terviews with a goal of describing and interpreting patterns
and themes that emerged from the data.
Recruitment
Inclusion criteria for the main study specified individuals
who self-identified as transmasculine regardless of stage
of transition. Participants were required to have experi-
enced or to be currently experiencing pregnancy and
birth, and there was no requirement regarding type of in-
fant feeding. Inclusion was not restricted by geography,
but all interviews were conducted in English.
We recruited a convenience sample of participants
mostly through the internet. A letter and a poster were
used to recruit participants. The letter was posted to the
Facebook page, “Birthing and Breast or Chestfeeding
Trans People and Allies,” (formerly “Birthing and Breast-
feeding Transmen and Allies”) managed by the first
author (TMD). The poster was circulated through email.
Data collection
TMD used a questionnaire to collect demographic and
descriptive information about participants before each
interview. He then used a semi-structured interview
guide that included a list of open-ended questions and
prompts. The questionnaire used to collect demograph-
ics information and the semi-structured question guide
used as a basis for interviews are included in Additional
file 1. Interviews were conducted by Skype or telephone.
To allow for personal preference and to ensure conveni-
ence, safety, privacy, and confidentiality, each participant
chose the time of their interview and whether it would
be a telephone call or a Skype call with cameras. All in-
terviews were audiotaped using a digital recorder, and
then transcribed verbatim, de-identified, and shared with
the team to consider themes that emerged as the inter-
views were conducted. Interviews continued until it was
determined we had a wide variety of experiences with
consistent, common topics.
Data analysis
The transcribed interviews were uploaded to NVivo 10
and JN-W, MW, and TMD coded data. We used a com-
bination of line-by-line coding and overall analyses to
identify associations, patterns, and relationships. These
steps were guided by qualitative description analyses
methods [26–28]. All interviews were coded by at least
two researchers. Each used their own topics and then
topics were merged. The topics that emerged from the
data about infant feeding were well-defined and prac-
tical. After the topics had been identified from the inter-
views, we reversed the process and the sets of approved
quotes were recoded under the topics to ensure we had
not missed any key topics.
Methodologically, we based our analysis on interpret-
ive description analysis. Thorne, Reimer Kirkham, and
O’Flynn-Magee state, “Interpretive description departs
from traditional qualitative descriptive approaches in
MacDonald et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2016) 16:106 
Page 3 of 17
 that it assumes nurse investigators are rarely satisfied
with description alone and are always exploring mean-
ings and explanations that may yield application implica-
tions” [29] (p. 6). We wanted an analysis that would
provide a rich description while at the same time giving
us an interpretation that would lead to recommenda-
tions for transmasculine individuals considering preg-
nancy or chestfeeding and for HCPs who work with
transgender patients and clients.
Results
Description of the participants
We had a sample of 22 participants ranging in age from
24 to 50 years. Nineteen spoke English as a first language,
and three cited both English and French or another lan-
guage as their first languages. Fifteen were living with a
partner at the time of their interview, and 17 participants
had a family income of over $40,000 CAD per year. Every
study participant had at least some college-level education,
and 13 participants had graduate degrees. Participants were
located in North America, Europe, and Australia.
For ethnicity, we used an open question and invited
participants to use their own descriptive words. Thirty-
nine different words were used by the 22 participants to
describe their ethnicity. Among the 22 participants, 11
used a single word, six used two words, four used three
words, and one participant used four words to describe
ethnicity. Thirteen participants used race as a means of
identifying ethnicity: ten White or Caucasian; two Black;
and one non-Hispanic. Nationality was cited 22 times
with five participants combining two or more terms to
describe themselves: Aboriginal, Albanian, American (2),
British, Canadian (2), Cajun, Cree, Creole, Czech, English
(2), European (2), French, German, Greek, Irish, Italian,
Ukrainian, and Welsh. Three used Jewish and one used a
country, Australia, to describe their background.
We did not ask specifically about disabilities in our
demographics questionnaire, but during interviews, two
participants mentioned that they were disabled or had a
partner or close friend with a disability who was involved
in their pregnancy and birth.
Twenty study participants had carried babies to term
at the time of their interviews. Fourteen participants had
one child. Eight participants reported on the initial ques-
tionnaire that they had experienced miscarriage and
during interviews two participants mentioned that they
had an abortion. Two participants mentioned during
interviews that their pregnancies were not planned. Preg-
nancy lengths and birth weights were unremarkable: births
occurred between 36 and 42 weeks gestation and birth
weights ranged from 2722 to 4308 g. Seven participants re-
ported experiencing postpartum depression, of whom three
participants received a medical diagnosis. Thirteen partici-
pants reported no symptoms of postpartum depression and
two had not reached the postpartum stage. Nine partici-
pants had taken testosterone before they conceived, eight
had started taking it for the first time after their children
were born, and five had never taken it.
Sixteen study participants chose to chestfeed for some
period of time, four participants did not attempt chest-
feeding, and two had not reached the point of infant
feeding (i.e., they were still pregnant or had a miscarriage).
Nine of the 22 study participants had chest masculinization
surgery before conceiving their babies. Six participants had
chest masculinization surgery after their children were
born, five desired the surgery in the future, and two did not
want it at all.
Participants’ experiences
We present the participants’ experiences in a chrono-
logical pattern with the categories of before pregnancy,
prenatal, postpartum (6 weeks post birth), and later
stage (after 6 weeks postpartum). This format follows
the narrative flow of the interviews and provides a rich
description of the participants’ stories.
Before pregnancy
Participants cited chest-related gender dysphoria as driv-
ing an urgent need for chest masculinization surgery. In
a certain context, gender dysphoria refers to a medical
diagnosis from the DSM-5 of an individual who displays
“a marked incongruence between one’s experienced/
expressed gender and assigned gender” [30] 302.85 (F64.1)
and experiences discomfort as a result. In this paper, we
use the term gender dysphoria to denote transgender indi-
viduals’ lived experiences of distress about their bodies as
they describe these experiences.
Chest masculinization surgery, also known as top surgery
or male chest-contouring surgery, refers to a procedure to
remove mammary tissue and create a masculine chest. It is
not the same as a breast reduction where the goal is to pro-
duce smaller but still recognizably female-shaped breasts. It
also differs from a mastectomy performed to prevent or
treat cancer. Chest masculinization surgery does not nor-
mally involve removal of all mammary tissue since doing so
would result in a sunken-looking chest.
Whether or not a participant had chest masculinization
surgery before
conceiving and the type of chest
masculinization surgery were main factors that af-
fected decisions and experiences around lactation and
feeding. Out of the nine study participants who had
chest masculinization surgery prior to their first preg-
nancies, five participants reported that they knew at
the time of surgery that they eventually wanted to
have children; four participants said they had not con-
sidered pregnancy or lactation at the time of surgery.
Although surgical techniques and their names varied,
the techniques as they were reported by participants
MacDonald et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2016) 16:106 
Page 4 of 17
 could be grouped into two categories: a) surgeries that
involved two broad incisions underneath the mammary
tissue and temporary removal and subsequent reposi-
tioning of the nipples using nipple grafts (often called
“double incision with nipple grafts”) and; b) surgeries
that removed mammary tissue while preserving the
nipple pedicles. Five participants had the “double inci-
sion” style surgery with nipple grafts. Three participants
had surgeries that preserved the nipple pedicles: one had
a “keyhole” or “purse-string” type procedure where inci-
sions bordered the areolae and the nipples were not
moved; one had a double incision style surgery but the
nipples were not re-positioned; and one had a procedure
similar to the double incision but a pedicle flap was used
to avoid the need for nipple grafts and to maintain intact
nipple stalks. One participant did not discuss the type of
surgery he had.
Participants were asked about their decisions regard-
ing chest masculinization surgery. Reasons for having
the surgery included chest-related gender dysphoria and
being identified as female due to having a female-appearing
chest. Participants also cited ongoing discomfort from bind-
ing, a term used to describe the practice of flattening the
chest with material such as bandage wrappings or tight,
stretchy garments. In all cases, chest masculinization
surgery seemed to provide immense relief from these
experiences. Two participants mentioned that the dra-
matic lessening of gender dysphoria brought about by
chest masculinization surgery facilitated the choice to
become pregnant, and these participants noted that the
level of gender dysphoria during pregnancy would have
been unbearable if they had female-appearing mam-
mary tissue.
I should know [the type of chest masculinization
surgery] and I don’t. That tells you how much I was
paying attention. I was like just get them off me, I don’t
care what you do. Just get them off me. [Cory, who
initially could not recall the surgical technique used for
his chest masculinization surgery but later in the
interview determined on the basis of his scars that it
must have been the double incision]
It [chest masculinization surgery] was the thing that
made it possible for me to get pregnant… and I’d
never been so depressed in that time that I tried to
get pregnant without top surgery… I literally had
nightmares of cutting my chest off with scissors… I
assumed that I couldn’t [chestfeed]. I mean it was
hard because it was one of the first things my mom had
said to me after I told her about the surgery—“Well,
you’re never going to be able to feed your babies and
that’s terrible.” And I was like, “Maybe I don’t wanna
feed my babies that way.” It was a point of defensiveness
with me that I could still have a relationship with
my child without feeding them from my chest.
[Felix, double incision surgery]
I don’t think that I could have navigated this entire
process [pregnancy] without having had top surgery.
[Oren]
Participants did not discuss future infant feeding
choices with their surgeons in consultations prior to
surgery, and no surgeon brought up the topic. Partici-
pants believed that their surgeons subscribed to a
binary view of gender, and that pregnancy and chest-
feeding would not fit with their surgeons’ ideas of
what a “true” transgender man would want to do. To
reveal that they were considering future pregnancies
or chestfeeding might delay or jeopardize their chance
to have chest masculinization surgery.
I didn’t want to wait. I was on a waiting list of
where to get it covered and I didn’t want to wait
anymore ’cause I’d been binding for 6 years…I
went to this plastic surgeon dude and he hadn’t
done a lot of trans surgeries but we paid for it…
He was just like, “Oh yeah, you’re the guy trapped
in a girl’s body, and now your body matches how
you feel inside.” And I was like, “Uh, yeah, sure,
thanks, I’ll take my new chest now and go.” [Kai]
The “born in the wrong body” or “trapped in the
wrong body” narrative is a simplistic depiction of trans-
gender people that is commonly found in media stories
[31]. Proponents of this narrative give the impression
that transgender people want to change all aspects of
themselves to conform absolutely to the opposite trad-
itional gender role and physical sex from what they were
assigned at birth, an assumption that would logically ex-
clude transmasculine bodies from the realm of preg-
nancy and lactation.
Four study participants specifically mentioned in inter-
views that they felt unable to discuss future pregnancy or
lactation with their surgeon before chest masculinization
surgery due to the surgeon’s belief in the gender binary or
the “trapped in the wrong body” narrative. One of these
participants explained that he postponed asking necessary
health-related questions until after surgery because he was
unsure of his surgeon’s views about gender identity.
To get top surgery you kind of have to talk about
it as if you never want to get pregnant, right, to
the surgeon. You can’t be wiggly about that so I
don’t know… I don’t think there was a way to talk
to him about getting surgery without having a
conventional narrative about it. [Felix]
MacDonald et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2016) 16:106

 After surgery, because again I didn’t know what his
[the surgeon’s] thought processes were about gender
identity, afterwards I called him up and I asked him.
I wasn’t really thinking about nursing, but more the
worry of are they going to grow back if I get pregnant.
[Oren]
Four participants were certain they would not be able
to chestfeed for physical reasons because they had
chosen chest masculinization surgery. They cited phys-
ical pain, inability to make milk, and lack of tissue to
latch to as a result of surgery as factors that would make
chestfeeding impossible.
I had top surgery a few years ago, so I chose then that
if I ever wanted to have a child I wouldn’t be able to
breastfeed. So I have a masculine chest and a formula,
bottle-feeding baby…my choice around top surgery
was one around which I felt incredibly disconnected
to my chest, so much so that I literally had no sensation
at all. [Dagan]
I think the biggest issues [with chestfeeding a baby
after chest masculinization surgery] may be physical
as opposed to psychological. After surgery it took my
chest about a year to get sensation back and it’s kind
of hit or miss. There are times when somebody
touches it and it kind of makes me nauseous…There’s
this fine line between I can feel it and it hurts, so I
don’t know. [Kennedy]
On the other hand, seven participants explained that
they knew well before conception that they wanted to
chestfeed their babies. They had family members who
breastfed or they had learned about how human milk
provides optimal nutrition and how chestfeeding is a
way to build a secure attachment between baby and par-
ent. Five participants mentioned that they delayed chest
masculinization surgery in part or wholly because of
their commitment to chestfeeding.
It [breastfeeding] is the absolute, well, first my mother
did. Um, and with the information that was available at
the time, it was the best thing to do for your baby.
[Nick, came out and transitioned after weaning]
My partner used to go out with a midwife. Her
girlfriend was learning to be a midwife while they
were together…So, she learned a lot of stuff around
chestfeeding. I was really surprised to learn all the
things about, the kind of stuff like how your body can
sense what is in the room and what your baby needs
antibodies to and your body can bump it up and
produce it in the milk. That to me, when I heard
those kind of things, it was just incredible that your
body could do that kind of thing. [Peter]
I always, I wanted it [chest masculinization surgery],
since transitioning, but because of being able to feed
my kids, I might have waited or I might not have
[speculating because surgery was not financially
possible]. [Vince]
Prenatal
During pregnancy, participants noticed and coped with
chest changes and planned for infant feeding. A wide range
of experiences were reported in terms of mammary tissue
growth as well as related gender dysphoria. Six of the par-
ticipants who had previous chest masculinization surgery
found that their chest tissue was growing back some
amount or even to pre-surgery size. Those who had not
had surgery experienced predictable chest growth.
Out of nine participants who had previous chest
masculinization surgery, two reported no change to their
chest tissue during pregnancy. Both participants had the
double incision surgery with nipple grafts. Three partici-
pants reported minor chest tissue changes: two had
double incision surgery with nipple grafts and one had
double incision surgery with a pedicle flap. One partici-
pant who had double incision surgery with nipple grafts
reported some degree of chest tissue changes. Two partici-
pants stated they experienced significant chest changes
during pregnancy and that their chest tissue had grown
back to its pre-surgical size. One of these participants had
liposuction and keyhole surgery and the other had double
incision surgery without repositioning of the nipples.
I was under the complete understanding that it was
permanent, that it was not ever going to grow back,
so actually it was quite the opposite—the fact that it
did grow back [during pregnancy] was really…I would
have done a lot better if I had been warned that that
was possible that that would happen. [Emmett,
previous chest masculinization surgery, double
incision with no nipple grafts or re-positioning]
The experience of gender dysphoria was a common
theme during pregnancy due to body changes, but it was
not experienced by all participants, and no two stories
were the same. While participants identified many bodily
sources of gender dysphoria including changing hormones,
widening hips, and reduced facial hair, breast or chest-
related gender dysphoria was cited frequently. Some partici-
pants described gender dysphoria as being simply about
their own relationship with their body.
I kind of feel like the whole pregnancy and certainly
birth and now feeding him it’s like I feel like I don’t
MacDonald et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2016) 16:106 
Page 6 of 17
 really have a body. It’s not my own. I’m not sure if
that’s a good or a bad thing but it just feels like I don’t
really own this body currently. So I guess to kind of
answer your question more, because it’s really hard, I
don’t really feel like myself, when I look at myself I
don’t look like myself and it was like prior to being
pregnant and having him I did a certain amount of
binding to my chest and that’s been really difficult to
not do that anymore and I feel very floppy all over the
place. [Julian]
Nine study participants stated that they did not
experience an increase in gender dysphoria related to
body changes during pregnancy, but they did experi-
ence distress when others misgendered them as a
result of their pregnancies or body changes. Partici-
pants described situations where growth of chest tissue
affected how their gender was perceived by others,
which then triggered their own gender dysphoria. Hav-
ing prominent chest tissue seemed to result in individ-
uals being identified by others as female more often
than other typically female secondary sex characteris-
tics, including a pregnant belly. Participants noted that
their pregnant bellies were frequently identified as fat,
male bellies, and were generally easier to disguise with
clothing than chests were.
My gender identity is still male [during pregnancy]
but it’s hard really because I believe my gender is also
part me and part society. So I think it’s, I’m both, and
so if society is not seeing it then I don’t really consider
myself there all the way, because I think it’s kind of a
two-way street there…Identity is not something that is
separate from my family or my community. [Emmett,
previous chest masculinization surgery, experienced
significant reversal of body changes during pregnancy
including reduced facial hair, higher-pitched voice, and
re-growth of chest]
I was pregnant, I was like seriously pregnant, and
then they [nurse at clinic] called me but, of course,
they call the female name [participant’s legal name
was female at the time] and we get up and we walk
over and the nurse hands the [specimen] cup to my
female partner, who doesn’t look pregnant at all,
she’s like very tall and thin, and then says “Oh, here,
I need this sample, and your husband can wait over
there,” and is like waving me off, this short, fat man,
and it’s like wait, no, it’s my husband that’s actually
pregnant. [Daniel]
Four participants who had not had chest masculinization
surgery mentioned that they had practiced chest binding
before they conceived their babies, but no participant
reported being able to bind during pregnancy. Those
who tried binding found it too painful or inadequate to
continue, which also contributed to chest-related gen-
der dysphoria. One participant who did have previous
chest masculinization surgery attempted binding be-
cause his mammary tissue increased during pregnancy
but he stated that the practice was ineffective for him.
So there was some swelling and I got binders again,
which I had gotten rid of years before, and just folded
them up so they would be over my belly, but in the
end I stopped using it because it didn’t feel like—it
wasn’t enough. [Felix, previous chest surgery, double
incision with nipple grafts]
I stopped binding pretty early because it was also very
tender. I didn’t go back [to binding] until I was
finished feeding my kids…between pregnancies I went
back to it but, but yeah, I mean that’s pretty much
how I coped. I just tried to let go of my usual way of
doing things. I think that was another step towards
not passing as much and sort of, I don’t know,
realizing that I was going to have to make some
compromises from the way that I would prefer to do
things because of the choice that I had made. [Vince,
no chest masculinization surgery]
The temporary nature of pregnancy and chestfeeding
came up often during interviews as a means of coping
with chest-related gender dysphoria. Participants an-
ticipated an eventual end to pregnancy and lactation,
and planned for future chest masculinization surgery
or surgical revisions. Revision surgery is commonly
performed at a minimum of 6 months after chest
masculinization surgery to ameliorate the appearance
of scars, remove excess tissue, improve symmetry, and
adjust nipple and areolar dimensions [32]. Utility and
purpose were also important as transmasculine indi-
viduals reminded themselves that body parts normally
associated only with distress would soon provide nu-
trition for their babies.
At the time I was just like it’s OK, now is not
forever. I’ve always wanted a revision and I never got
one so the way I got myself through it [pregnancy
with mammary tissue growing back] is I was just like
it’s OK because I was planning on getting the
revision anyways. [Kai, previous liposuction and
keyhole surgery]
I just really felt like I’d been stuck in this body, I’d hated
it my whole life and here was just this one amazing thing
that my chest could do that you know I sort of felt like
that’s maybe the reason why I had been given this body.
MacDonald et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2016) 16:106

 So I just felt like it was something that I wanted to do.
[Peter, no previous chest masculinization surgery]
With the breasts, it was like what do I have these for
anyway. The functional aspect of it to me, that made
the most sense to me. I guess on some bizarre level I
just wanted to feel like there was some reason I have
this body. I guess having, being equipped with a body
that was female, it seemed like that was a reasonable
thing to do, was to use the breasts to feed the baby.
[Daniel, no previous chest masculinization surgery]
Post-surgical participants assessed their chests for
changes during their pregnancies to try to determine if
chestfeeding would be realistic. They had concerns
about milk production and the ability to latch a baby to
a chest with little tissue.
My first indication that I was pregnant, even on the
miscarriage, was that my breasts were tender, my
nipples were tender. Or at least on my right side I
was. My left side—both of my nipples were made
from one nipple—and so the one on my right side is
more I guess whole, or has more integrity than the
left, so the one on the left I never had much happen
but the one on the right I did. And then I actually had
a little bit of swelling I think. There was no permanent
change but I definitely had sensitivity so much so that I
really thought I might be able to produce a little bit of
milk. [Cory, previous double incision with nipple grafts]
I am pretty sure that, well, my chest tissue hasn’t grown
back. It grew back right at the start of the pregnancy a
small amount just here and then it stopped. I’m pretty
sure that, I’ve done some reading, and I’m worried
about the baby being able to latch on, there being
enough tissue to latch on. [Travis, previous double
incision chest masculinization surgery]
During their pregnancies, participants planned ahead
for infant feeding and sought information and support for
their choices. All study participants who had not had pre-
vious chest masculinization surgery chose to chestfeed
their infants, and seven participants described it as a sim-
ple decision due to what they considered health benefits
and the utility of chestfeeding. Four participants also men-
tioned bonding and attachment parenting as reasons to
chestfeed their babies. Participants cited aspects of their
identities and circumstances other than identifying as
transmasculine when they described how they arrived at
their decisions. They discussed racialized communities,
parenting and breastfeeding groups, urban versus rural
settings, and other family members’ infant feeding choices
as contributing significantly in terms of their decision.
I always knew I would breastfeed. I had known that
there are a lot of benefits to breastfeeding. It wasn’t even
a choice, I just knew. I was fortunate that I could.
[Alex, came out and transitioned after weaning his child]
We happen to live in a place where there are all these
hippies and we shop at a co-op, and everyone is
breastfeeding like crazy. There’s a store that sells cloth
diapers up my street. We just happened to move into
the most progressive area ever. When I meet people
they recognize that I’m transgender without me even
saying anything half the time…Here, you’re much
more likely to hear about breastfeeding or at least see
it…We talk about—in the black community, in
cities—there can be this overwhelming feeling that it’s
not socially acceptable. I’ve heard people say that,
“We don’t do that because that is what slaves did.”
[Adam, multiracial family]
One of the most supportive communities I found
during my pregnancy was the La Leche League
community, which my midwife was heavily involved
in. And she got me connected to a lot of other people
and they were just so accepting and warm and
gracious…I also really wanted that relationship with
my child. I wanted that connection, you know, of
holding my child, my own child, to my chest, being
connected in that way and being able to offer that not
just nourishing but nurturing aspect. [Cory, previous
double incision with nipple grafts]
I did read up a lot about nursing for example. I don’t
know how it’s like now, I think North America in
general has become a bit more breastfeeding friendly,
but you know 15 years ago it was just starting to come
back into the public landscape and there was still a lot
of push against it. That’s where I did take charge
because I wanted to inform myself because I knew I
was going to face some resistance possibly from family
members or health care providers. [Gabby, experienced
pregnancy before coming out or transitioning]
Six participants mentioned that they experienced signifi-
cant pressure from health care providers, friends, or family
to chestfeed their babies. Two participants reported that
their decisions about chestfeeding affected their legal cus-
tody rights as parents. When midwives and doulas were
explicitly pro-chestfeeding and seemed obviously pleased
that their clients did choose to chestfeed, participants de-
scribed a greater sense of anxiety and pressure to succeed.
My lawyer very strongly suggested that I do it because
it’s a very….If you’re breastfeeding the child they
[social services] are less likely to take it away from
MacDonald et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2016) 16:106 
Page 8 of 17
 you. So she [lawyer] very much pushed, “You have to
breastfeed—you have to prove that you’re breastfeeding.
If possible do it in front of the social workers when they
come around.” I was just, like, I’d really rather not. I
planned on pumping and then giving the child the
breast milk but not actually full on doing it. But I had
to. [Ben, no previous chest surgery]
Because I’m not a mom…and I wasn’t breastfeeding
or chestfeeding, for me, there wasn’t any assumption
that this kid needed to be with me. The idea was you
could separate him from me earlier on [in order to
share custody], but all the hormones from giving
birth, all the other connections are still there, and it
was incredibly painful. [Felix, double incision surgery]
People who know that I’ve had—I call it a double
mastectomy to them because that’s the easiest—and
they see my chest, they see everything and then they
ask me about breastfeeding. Midwives and doulas, like
that’s a big thing. And I’m like I don’t have any
breasts. It’s not even that I have a little bit of tissue. I
have nothing, it’s not there. The nipples were removed
and put back. I really don’t think that that’s going to
happen. [Oren]
I’ve sort of run into health workers who are trying to
be respectful saying, “So how do you want to feed?”
But then as soon as I say I’m going to nurse they’re
like, “Oh, good,” which then puts me in a position
that like if I ever want to change my mind I know
they’re going to be disappointed in me or whatever it
is, like it puts the pressure on. [Lee]
Postpartum
The postpartum period involved a variety of lactation and
chest-related challenges and experiences. Seven of the 16
participants who initiated chestfeeding reported that they
experienced gender dysphoria while chestfeeding. Five of
these individuals found means of coping with gender
dysphoria such as making use of layered clothing or think-
ing in terms of the utility of chestfeeding. For two of the
participants, intense and overwhelming gender dysphoria
was cited as a main reason for why they could not con-
tinue chestfeeding. As during the prenatal period, gender
dysphoria did not always have to do solely with the indi-
vidual’s body and what it was doing, but also how the body
was being seen and gendered by others.
I was huge, like, it grew like everything came in, so
that was dysphoric and I didn’t know what to do with
it. I was producing a ton of milk. I mean I could have
nursed her fine you know but I just…I didn’t have
anything ready socially, either. I didn’t have any zip-up
binders. I had no way to stop the milk from leaking
through my chest. I had no appropriate clothes for, male
clothes for nursing. I didn’t have any of it so and it was
just too much to organize on too little sleep. [Emmett,
previous double incision without nipple grafts]
I was like, “He needs to eat!” It’s like these two things
warring inside of me. One, I’m transgender, but two, I’m
a really big proponent of attachment parenting. I think
that it’s awesome. I think that breastfeeding and
babywearing and family bed and all that stuff really help.
[Adam, began coming out and transitioning before
pregnancy, presented during pregnancy as female]
I would sometimes go, OK, I’m supposed to be like
baby’s so sweet, and we’re bonding, and I was like,
whatever, eat. [Henry, came out to himself and others
and transitioned after chestfeeding was finished]
Um, even with the nursing I don’t think I’m going to
do extended. Like, I might last a couple months but
you know I’m going to want to be back on
testosterone and because I present as female during
the pregnancy and I can only live my life as being
seen as female for so long. [Emmett, planning for an
additional future pregnancy]
Privacy during chestfeeding was often important to
participants. Two participants mentioned in interviews
that the need to chestfeed without anyone witnessing,
judging, or gendering the process conflicted with their
ability to seek chestfeeding support and help.
I spent a lot of time in the room by myself for
probably the first 3 months. Every time I needed to
feed her I would just go away and do it because I just
didn’t feel like I could do it in front of other people.
[Peter, no previous chest masculinization surgery;
presented as female to all health care providers except
his doula]
So I tried [to chestfeed] a few times but I had this like
intense privacy about it. Like I didn’t want anyone to
know, I didn’t want anyone to see and it just didn’t
work out with bringing her home and the in-laws and
everything. [Emmett]
I was feeling really inadequate because I had chest
surgery and stuff and so anytime she wouldn’t latch I
would get really upset. I was really heavily dependent
on him [husband] and for a while I wouldn’t try to get
her to latch if he wasn’t there…I decided not to [get
help from a care provider] because it was so hard that
I just couldn’t… I knew that I couldn’t deal if someone
MacDonald et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2016) 16:106 
Page 9 of 17
 ended up being, “Well, of course, she’s not latching.” I
pictured the worst and I couldn’t do it. You just, you are
putting your trust, and you just never know. [Kai,
previous keyhole chest masculinization surgery; did not
plan to chestfeed; learned how to use a supplementer
from reading a blog post]
Out of the 16 participants who initiated chestfeeding,
nine reported that they did not experience any gender
dysphoria as a result of the act of chestfeeding. Four
participants mentioned in interviews that they were
comfortable chestfeeding their babies in public spaces.
Again, the participants cited the utility of lactation to
fulfill the needs of their babies. One participant expressed
the belief that chestfeeding in public is an important, posi-
tive act from a social and political perspective.
In the beginning, I was really worried about how that
was going to work, like if I was going to be OK with it
[chestfeeding]. I have a tendency to cover up in
multiple layers and don’t really reveal myself in
public. I was really worried about feeding him in
public and around friends and family but I think what
was kind of interesting to me was that once she was
born it just kind of became this thing I needed to do.
[Julian, no previous chest masculinization surgery]
I actually really liked it [chestfeeding]. Again, I saw it
as a physical process that my body was able to do.
Like with the pregnancy, I didn’t gender it. I was like
OK, my body can do this, and it actually feels good
and I know that my baby is getting something out of
it. It was really relaxing. It was nice. [Gabby, came out
and transitioned after chestfeeding was finished]
I was happy to be able to use ’em you know. I always
said it sure would be nice to take ’em off and put ’em
on a shelf you know. For me it was great to be able to
use ’em for their intended purpose. [Nick, came out
and transitioned after weaning]
Sometimes I kind of covered up. I really liked to wear a
button down shirt with an undershirt underneath it and
then I could button my shirt down a certain amount and
then pull up my undershirt a little bit like an A-shirt…I
do think that it’s something [chestfeeding in public] that
people should be doing, or that there should be more
public space for feeding kids generally and so I was
willing to put myself out there a little bit because it’s
something that I feel strongly about on a social and
political level. So, yeah, sometimes I’d get looks but I
didn’t really get many comments and people didn’t
really make gendered comments to me about feeding
my kids. Yeah, because I think at that point I wasn’t
really passing at all. [Vince, no previous chest
masculinization surgery]
Some participants had to cope with physical challenges
in the postpartum period that were specifically related to
medical aspects of their transition. Two participants who
had previous chest masculinization surgery experienced
engorgement and early signs of mastitis for which they
and their health care providers were ill-prepared. One par-
ticipant who had previous double incision surgery with
nipple grafts described his struggle to latch his baby.
It’s a good thing I had a doula because my OB/GYN
didn’t say anything about like you need to work—I
assumed there wouldn’t be anything to dry up. But
actually I did and I almost got mastitis. I started to get
sick. I had a lot of pain and I started to get red,
streaky hot spots. That’s the mastitis thing. And I
started to get a fever. And they, my friend who’s a
doula just came and brought all these cabbages and
did all this stuff. And I had to get a night doula to get
Benadryl some nights too because the, all the other
stuff just wasn’t working fast enough. [Felix, previous
double incision with nipple grafts; chose before the
birth to bottlefeed]
With the follow-up check with the pediatrician, I had
developed this mass you know on the left side that
was really scary. It was rock hard it was like about this
big and I didn’t know what it meant or if it was safe,
or what the deal was. So we asked at the doctor and
the midwives and we had them check it at the clinic
when we took the baby when she was like a week old
and they said like well then they recommended not
nursing. [Emmett]
I only got him to latch on once for like 10 s and it
was glorious. I was like, oh my God, at least I got to
feel that at least—I got to experience that little bit and
I’ll never forget it but beyond that he never would…
Because it was my midwife [who was providing
assistance with latching], because it was her, and we
had such a good relationship, it was great. I mean it
was, you know, she so obviously had my best interests
at heart and she cared for me personally and for my
baby and for our family in general so I felt very open;
I wasn’t scared or nervous. I would have been
probably with anybody else. [Cory, previous double
incision with nipple grafts]
Two study participants who had planned not to chest-
feed due to lack of chest tissue, as well as anticipated
gender dysphoria, reversed these decisions after their
babies were born.
MacDonald et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2016) 16:106 
Page 10 of 17
 After she was born, you know she had kind of like
crawled up on my chest and I felt the instinct to nurse
her which I had really like I mean I had planned so
much against it that I had, they had the medication on
hand to make the milk dry up…[Emmett, previous
chest masculinization surgery]
She was born on a Sunday, yeah, I would say it was a
Wednesday when they [mammary glands] got all like
puffy. Yeah and I hadn’t tried to see if anything—like
it hadn’t occurred to me before that if I could
squeeze them and see if…It was my midwife who
came over and told me to do that…We were using a
bottle and that’s kind of, yeah. It wasn’t until I
realized I was producing milk that I was like, oh my
God, I want to feed my baby this way and I really
want to make this work…[Kai, previous liposuction
and keyhole surgery]
Participants commented about how lactation-related
care could be made transgender-competent. Some par-
ticipants reported that they felt respected as transgender
patients by individual perinatal providers and that they
did not need to educate their providers in terms of lan-
guage or identity. Two study participants described being
touched on their chest without consent, an experience
that caused distress during an already challenging time.
Participants suggested a need for health care providers to
communicate respect for different feeding choices other
than chestfeeding, and that providers should neither
assume a desire to chestfeed nor push for it.
At one point I was trying to get her to latch and she
had just latched when the nurse came in and she was
like “Oh, oh, I’ll leave you guys,” and then she came
back a bit later and was like, “I’ll talk you through
breastfeeding and help you,” and she used “dad” the
whole time and “chest.” And I never asked her to do
that. She just she was like, “Yeah, you wanna have her
on dad’s chest,” and that was the language she used so
I thought that was pretty cool. [Kai, previous liposuction
and keyhole surgery]
About the nurses, one challenging thing after birth
was there’s this huge push to like get the baby latched
on and work on feeding and that was challenging
because people didn’t really ask if they could grab my
breast. You know, they would just grab and manipulate,
and um that was pretty alarming. [Julian, no previous
chest masculinization surgery, presented as female to
care providers]
I think there’s a real push towards breast is best, which
I think is great for a lot of reasons, but I’d also want to
see health workers have in mind that there are a variety
of reasons why people might not nurse and that a lot of
those reasons are valid and that gender issues might be
a valid reason not to nurse. [Lee]
Study participants discussed their use of donor milk.
Seven participants used donor milk or said they were
considering using it, and one donated to babies in need.
One of these participants mentioned that he received
donor milk through a care provider, while another cited
a lack of information from health care providers regard-
ing donor milk. One participant recounted that his care
providers did not provide adequate information about
bottle-feeding. Only one study participant used an at-
chest supplementer to feed his baby. Two participants
described how they bonded with their babies through
close bottle-feeding.
I guess I do have a little bit of a regret. I did have an
SNS [supplementer] system that I had in the cabinet
for months before my son was born and, in the end,
I didn’t even try it. I don’t know why. I think I had
put so much effort into trying to produce a little bit
of my own milk, and going so far as having blisters
from pumping and all that. I had that little weird
gadget as I saw it, and I just couldn’t see, you know,
if I’m not producing any of my own milk, I just
didn’t see using that. [Cory, previous double incision
with nipple grafts]
I’ve felt like I could get more information [about
infant feeding and using a supplementer] from
other trans guys, so with them [health care
providers] I focus on the pregnancy and the birth
and get me through this. I just don’t want to add
anything else to it…I was interested in the
supplemental system, like at-the-chest sort of
thing, but there was way too much going on to
really try. I was really like, I don’t, just put the
bottle in his mouth…I was trying to learn a lot of
things, cloth diapering, it’s a lot. [Oren, previous
double incision chest masculinization surgery]
I didn’t know anything about people having donor
milk through milk shares locally or anything like
that. I would have been scrambling. That’s another
thing that trans people should be made aware of
about during their prenatal care, that that’s available
and how to educate about that. I don’t know if
doctors would talk about that. If it’s too much of a
liability to talk about it because of the aspect where
you are responsible for screening people and making
decisions where you think milk could be contaminated
or not. [Adam, speculating about what he would have
MacDonald et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2016) 16:106 
Page 11 of 17
 done if he did not have a full milk supply]
When she has a regular feed like from a bottle she takes
about six ounces but when she takes it from me, uh the
amount that she takes from me,’cause you know I use a
bottle with the tube [homemade supplementer], she
usually only takes about four. So my guess is in each
feed she’s getting about one to two ounces. [Kai,
previous liposuction and keyhole surgery]
We get the closeness with the bottles. Even now when
baby has her feedings, she’s so particular about it. You
know, we have to go into the bed, or the quiet place
and she has to cuddle, and you know in fact we often
call it nursing anyway because it’s not my chest but
it’s still the same action from me. [Emmett]
Along with the physical need for donor milk due to
chest masculinization surgery or gender dysphoria, there
were social aspects to milk sharing as well. Just as one
participant made a decision about chestfeeding in the
context of his multiracial family and broader commu-
nity, another participant discussed milk sharing from his
perspective as a black, transgender person. The partici-
pant reported deciding to come out as gay but not as
transgender to his milk donors, and he wryly noted his
experience as a black, gay parent receiving milk from
many white donors.
I went on to Human Milk 4 Human Babies and I said
we were two gay guys—I didn’t mention I was
trans—and women were throwing themselves at us,
like they got progressive points for giving the gay
dudes breast milk…[Partner’s] mom bought us a chest
freezer for Christmas ’cause she was tired of us
putting milk in hers. He’s loving it, he’s fat, and I’m
happy. Everybody’s getting sick, and he’s had a cold,
but that’s pretty much it. I always say he’s got the
antibodies of like 18 different white women so he’s
good to go. [Oren, Black]
Later stage
Three participants chestfed for under 6 months, 11 partici-
pants chestfed for more than 1 year, and two participants
were in the early postpartum period at the time of their in-
terviews and were still chestfeeding. As chestfeeding went
on, participants had to make choices about how to balance
feeding their babies with gender dysphoria, mental health,
and the need to transition.
Two study participants considered binding their chests
while they were still chestfeeding but explained that they
were unable to do so successfully due to discomfort and
a fear of causing mastitis. However, one participant
(pseudonym “Adam”) did practice binding and also
took testosterone while he was chestfeeding, and he
reported these as positive choices. Prior to his preg-
nancy, Adam had not had chest masculinization sur-
gery and had taken testosterone for under 1 year. He
noted that binding and taking testosterone allowed
him to present as male and also chestfeed his child
into toddlerhood. Both his gender presentation and
chestfeeding past infancy were important to this par-
ticipant. Adam identified the way hormones made him
feel as a source of gender dysphoria. He also cited the
way others perceived him based on his appearance as
a trigger of gender dysphoria.
I didn’t want to force wean him at all. It was just
getting to a point where I—I mean it’s such a
nebulous feeling, it’s difficult to describe but it’s like
you just feel inside what your hormonal dysphoria
is, if you have dysphoria around your hormones,
and you just know, this is where it’s going to be
really bad now, from now on, I’m going to be
miserable. [Adam]
In general with transition, I find that when you
try to ask people to respect your name and
pronouns and who you are, but if you don’t have
facial hair and your features are really such that
they are going to read you as a woman all the
time, it’s really hard for me to get people to take
it seriously, and even when they were acting
respectful toward me it was like they were doing
it to please me but they didn’t really see me the
way that I am and it just started to bother me
more and more. I was trying to keep my chin up
and be really optimistic and I think I succeeded
with that for a long time but it was just like you
know what, enough is enough. [Adam]
Adam began binding with caution when his baby
was approximately 10 months old. He would bind for
short periods of time (i.e., an hour or less) and pay
close attention to sensations of fullness or discomfort
in his chest. He gradually increased the duration of
binding sessions and did not experience any problems
such as mastitis.
The binding that I use, it’s made of really flexible, elastic
material so it shifts around. It’s got this zipper…It doesn’t
have Velcro, it doesn’t have much compression. It’s really
good for nursing. At first I didn’t like it ’cause it was
short and it reminded me of a bra and I thought I’d
rather have something like an undershirt but for nursing
it’s perfect because I can just unzip it discreetly in a
public place and feed him and then zip it up. People
don’t necessarily realize that he’s eating…He knows how
MacDonald et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2016) 16:106 
Page 12 of 17
 to unzip my binder. He’s just sort of like, “It’s time for
me to eat.” [Adam]
To re-start testosterone therapy, Adam consulted with
his endocrinologist and his child’s paediatrician. Adam
reported that his doctors referred to a study of low-level
testosterone use in lactating, cisgender women to assess
safety [33]. He stated that his doctors recommended re-
starting testosterone therapy and watching the child
closely for any signs of early puberty such as body hair.
Adam did re-start testosterone therapy when his child
was approximately 21 months old. He reported that ap-
proximately 15 months after he had re-started testoster-
one at a standard dose for female-to-male therapy, blood
tests showed normal testosterone levels in his child. He
did not notice a decrease in his milk supply that coin-
cided with re-starting testosterone.
I think that getting top surgery and just starting to
really feel just this tangible feeling to how much time
I have to wait because it was going to be 6 months
after he weaned [before surgeon would advise having
chest masculinization surgery] and knowing that he
could nurse for a long, long time. That actually really
drove me with the testosterone decision because it’s
going to be a while before I can do something else to
relieve things. But between binding and testosterone,
that puts me in a really good place with things.
[Adam]
Participants described a wide range of thoughts and
feelings about getting chest masculinization surgery
after weaning was finished. One participant used the
surgery as a reward for reaching his personal chestfeed-
ing goals. Six
participants described getting chest
masculinization surgery as a simple decision once their
mammary tissue was no longer being used to nourish
their children.
In my mind it [chest masculinization surgery] was like a
reward. I felt like if I could at least chestfeed her for the
first year then it meant that I could get top surgery, so
it was something that I used as like a bit of a, I guess a
goal, or something to work towards. [Peter]
I want it [chest masculinization surgery] to happen as
soon as possible. Because I pretty much I have the
feeling that the breasts were good only for feeding my
babies. Otherwise I don’t need them at all…Here I go
often at the nude beach and when I am walking there
I often I am just crossing my arms so that people
couldn’t see the breasts just like a habit or I don’t
know because I don’t care if they look at me on the
bottom, I, it doesn’t matter but the breasts somehow I
feel like they don’t belong there. [Ron]
They were used for their intended purpose. No, I was
happy to get rid of them. [Nick]
I feel glad that we’re not planning, like I’m not planning
to carry another kid, so I don’t feel like it’s this either or
decision [to have chest masculinization surgery or to
chestfeed] for my child. So, which I know, definitely
know guys who are making that sort of either or
decision for kids that they intend to carry. So I’m really
glad I don’t have to do that. [Henry, had chest
masculinization surgery after weaning was finished]
Three participants mentioned that they never experi-
enced gender dysphoria while chestfeeding but did ex-
perience intense gender dysphoria soon after weaning.
For these participants, having mammary tissue and using
it to feed did not seem to be problematic. However,
when their chests were no longer a source of nourish-
ment and others identified these individuals as female
because of their chests, intense social gender dysphoria
was triggered. One participant did not feel a need for
surgery and opted to bind after weaning.
You know it [breastfeeding] was absolutely the best
time of my life, even now… As soon as I was done
breastfeeding within about a month my dysphoria
came back to the point where I couldn’t handle it…It
[choosing chest masculinization surgery] was a tough
decision for me because I did have such emotional
ties because of my experience with my son and the
fact that I did want more kids and I always wanted to
breastfeed my kids. But, because I was so large
chested I knew that this was something I had to do.
Because I already had a full beard, I was passing as
male. I couldn’t live with the chest I had and I also
couldn’t bind…They [chest] were so large. And
through the summer it was just too much. I couldn’t
eat with the binder on. It was causing other health
problems. So I made the decision I had to make even
though my chest dysphoria was never terrible. So I
went for surgery. [Alex]
I did not [experience gender dysphoria while
chestfeeding]. No, mm mm. I was and still am, I mean
I’ve just had top surgery, but my, my chest was not a
huge source of body dysphoria for me. It was
something that, if we lived in a different world that
was more accepting of just different identities and
different bodies I’m not sure that I would have gotten
top surgery. But since you know it’s this sort of thing
where people are going to question my identity as a
man because of my chest and I wanted to be able to

 go to the pool or whatever and take off my shirt. Like
I really like to swim and I felt really vulnerable
whenever I would go swimming, like everyone is
seeing me as a woman when I go swimming. In the
suits that I have to wear, even though I wear a t-shirt
or whatever, I just felt like, yeah, I just felt like so
vulnerable like everyone sees a woman right now so
that was where that decision came in to get top
surgery and it’s been fantastic. [Andrew]
I was very conflicted about potential top surgery, and in
the end I’ve decided not to get it but for other reasons.
At first I was like I don’t know if I could ever do that
because yeah I fed my baby with these…That concern
kind of eventually faded because I nurture him in other
ways now. I don’t want to put myself through
unnecessary surgery anymore. I’m OK with them being
there. I’ve found some comfortable binders, and I’m
like you know what, that’s fine. [Gabby]
Discussion
It is apparent from the findings that health care providers
working with transgender clients require a nuanced under-
standing of gender dysphoria that goes beyond the familiar
“trapped in the wrong body” narrative. Media depictions of
gender dysphoria have treated it as a condition to be cured
by medical transitioning and by conforming to societal ex-
pectations of traditional gender roles [31]. This strategy
may be best for some transgender individuals, but not for
all [31]. Participants in this study did not necessarily equate
lactation and chestfeeding with femininity, and for those
who did, they sometimes opted to chestfeed while finding
ways to cope with gender dysphoria if they experienced it.
The experiences of transmasculine individuals reported
here show that chest-related gender dysphoria frequently
led to chest masculinization surgery and affected feeding
choices. Some individuals cited others’ gendered percep-
tions of their chests and chestfeeding choices, as well as
care providers’ physical touching of their chest without
permission, as triggers of gender dysphoria. Dutton and
Fennie [19] also found that having prominent mammary
tissue was a particularly intense source of gender dys-
phoria in the transgender men they interviewed. For
others in our study, there were ways to cope with the dys-
phoria and reasons such as infant nutrition that made it
worthwhile to chestfeed. In another variation, some trans-
gender individuals in our study reported that the act of
chestfeeding seemed to mitigate their gender dysphoria
because of its utility.
The issue of gendered language was raised frequently
by the participants and it has been addressed by other
authors [15, 24]. In addition to preferred pronouns, one
should consider using masculine or gender-neutral
language such as “chestfeeding,” “parent,” and “parental”
instead of “breastfeeding,” “mum,” and “maternity.” In
North America, “nursing” could substitute for “breast-
feeding.” Providers need to be aware that the act of
breastfeeding or chestfeeding is not necessarily per-
ceived as feminine by their transmasculine clients.
From the interviews, we see a distinction between gen-
der dysphoria rooted in the individual’s feelings about
their body versus gender dysphoria triggered by social
interactions. This distinction has important implications
for health care providers. It means that care providers
and others are capable of causing gender dysphoria in a
patient by misgendering them. Conversely, care providers
can affirm a patient’s gender identity through appropriate
language, respectful touch, and other intentional actions,
and thus alleviate distress associated with gender dysphoria.
Care providers should use the pronouns and gendered
language that patients have stated they prefer, rather
than making assumptions based on a patient’s appear-
ance or behaviour. In other words, in order to avoid trig-
gering gender dysphoria, HCPs must believe the patient
when gender identity is disclosed to them and they must
demonstrate respect by using appropriate language. As
one participant stated and others reiterated in various
ways, gender identity is a “two-way street” that involves
declaring one’s gender to others, but also having one’s
felt gender reflected back to one by others, including
health care providers. Care providers could increase
their language awareness and competence by practicing
the use of gender-neutral language outside of clinical
settings and prior to meeting their first transgender cli-
ents. We suggest that the ability to use appropriate lan-
guage is an important skill to be developed, especially in
pregnancy and childbirth settings where the norm is to
use feminine pronouns and descriptors.
In the academic and medical literature, it is commonly
reported that deepening of the voice and growth of body
and facial hair, as a result of testosterone treatment, are
irreversible in transmasculine individuals [3, 5, 18]. In
contrast, we have found this to be true for some, yet for
others these secondary sex changes are fully reversible
upon the cessation of testosterone treatment. Health
care providers should understand that a transgender in-
dividual’s gender presentation can revert unpredictably
as a result of ceasing testosterone therapy, and that body
changes can be distressing for an individual whose gen-
der expression has previously been more masculine.
Bauer et al. report that transgender persons frequently
avoid using emergency department services because of
previous negative experiences or fear of negative experi-
ences due to their transgender status [17]. We found a
similar phenomenon with study participants’ perceptions
of their care providers’ assumptions becoming a barrier
to accessing care. Surgeons were viewed as gatekeepers
to chest masculinization surgery who would not be

Page 14 of 17
 accepting of future plans for pregnancy or chestfeeding
in a transmasculine client. As a result, participants did
not obtain information that they required. Two partici-
pants avoided asking for lactation help because they had
strong needs for privacy during chestfeeding or because
they perceived that care providers observing them would
misgender them or negatively judge their past choices
regarding chest masculinization surgery.
To mitigate problems, we suggest that care providers
give clients cues early on in the provider-patient rela-
tionship to demonstrate that they have a flexible under-
standing of gender and gender roles in infant feeding
and parenting. Surgeons should state in a pre-operative
consultation that they are aware that some transmascu-
line individuals choose to become pregnant or chestfeed
after chest masculinization surgery, thereby opening an
opportunity for discussion. Transmasculine individuals
considering the surgery need information about the pos-
sibility of mammary tissue regrowth in the case of preg-
nancy. Lactation consultants could mention that they
understand that transmasculine clients experience a
range of gender dysphoria over chests and chestfeeding
or sometimes no dysphoria at all, and then ask the indi-
vidual how they can best be supported in their plans. If
touching might trigger gender dysphoria in a client, a
care provider could employ hands-off techniques to
demonstrate positioning for chestfeeding or the use of a
supplementer.
We learned from the participants that HCPs must be
educated about chest care for transmasculine individuals
during pregnancy and postpartum. Chest binding during
pregnancy will likely be uncomfortable and ineffective
beginning early on in gestation and continuing through-
out pregnancy. Transmasculine people who have had
chest masculinization surgery need to be aware that
mammary tissue may or may not grow during preg-
nancy. Chestfeeding, if desired, may be possible if there
is enough tissue for a comfortable latch. Some transmascu-
line individuals do produce milk after chest masculinization
surgery, although at-chest supplementation and donor milk
or formula is likely to be required. They should be given
the tools to successfully establish a chestfeeding relation-
ship, especially around the use of at-chest supplementers.
The study identified a need for HCPs to provide an-
ticipatory guidance to transmasculine individuals regard-
ing postpartum chest health and lactation. Transgender
patients should be taught to recognize engorgement,
plugged ducts, and mastitis, whether or not they intend
to chestfeed their babies, regardless of their history of
chest masculinization surgery. Some participants lacked
information about engorgement and mastitis because of
the incorrect assumption that someone who had chest
masculinization surgery would not experience lactogen-
esis II following birth.
HCPs should be knowledgeable about potential prob-
lems that can be caused by constriction of mammary
tissue (e.g., constriction from bras or baby carriers can
lead to pugged ducts or mastitis) because transmasculine
patients might have questions about how to safely chest
bind during lactation. In order to cope with gender dys-
phoria, transmasculine individuals who are chestfeeding
might begin binding with caution for short periods after
their milk supply has stabilized. Based on the experience
of one study participant, others might wish to take tes-
tosterone while chestfeeding under the guidance of a
physician who can monitor the infant for possible signs
of exposure.
The study finds strength in its roots in the transgender
community. It benefits from the leadership of a trans-
gender man who birthed and chestfed two children and
a research team that includes clinicians who work with
transgender and queer clients and patients. The inclu-
sion of participants who transitioned before having
children as well as those who transitioned afterwards
provides a rich understanding of the many ways that
transgender individuals experience pregnancy, birth, and
infant feeding.
The key limitation for this study is about transferability.
We do not know whether the convenience sample we re-
cruited reflects the general population of transmasculine
individuals experiencing pregnancies. All of the study par-
ticipants were university educated, and the majority were
financially secure and in a committed relationship.
Further studies on this topic should attempt to in-
clude more low-income individuals and those with less
formal education, and they should also aim to better
understand geographical considerations. Future re-
search could try to determine the effect of different
types of chest masculinization surgery on lactation. As
a possible trend to investigate, we did note that the
two participants with previous chest masculinization
surgery who had significant mammary tissue re-growth
and some amount of lactation following birth both had
surgeries that preserved the nipple stalks instead of surger-
ies involving nipple grafts. The experiences and needs of
transmasculine individuals who had unplanned pregnancies
could be an important topic for future research.
Conclusions
The information gathered in this study sheds light on a
wide range of transmasculine individuals’ experiences
with lactation and infant feeding. Study participants
shared stories that were personal and nuanced. There is
no single experience that is the transgender experience
of infant feeding. It is apparent that transmasculine indi-
viduals who give birth sometimes choose to chestfeed,
even when they have had previous chest surgery, while
others do not chestfeed their babies for physical and

 mental health reasons. Care providers should communi-
cate an understanding of gender dysphoria and trans-
gender identities in order to build patient trust and
provide transgender-competent care. Further, HCPs need
to be knowledgeable about lactation and chest care during
binding and following chest masculinization surgery, re-
gardless of the chosen feeding method, through all stages:
before pregnancy, pregnancy, and post birth.
