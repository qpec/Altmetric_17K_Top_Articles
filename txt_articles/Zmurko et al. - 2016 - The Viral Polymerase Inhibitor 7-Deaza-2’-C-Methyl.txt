Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging flavivirus typically causing a dengue-like febrile illness, but
neurological complications, such as microcephaly in newborns, have potentially been linked
to this viral infection. We established a panel of in vitro assays to allow the identification of
ZIKV inhibitors and demonstrate that the viral polymerase inhibitor 7-deaza-2’-C-methyla-
denosine (7DMA) efficiently inhibits replication. Infection of AG129 (IFN-α/β and IFN-γ
receptor knock-out) mice with ZIKV resulted in acute neutrophilic encephalitis with viral anti-
gens accumulating in neurons of the brain and spinal cord. Additionally, high levels of viral
RNA were detected in the spleen, liver and kidney, and levels of IFN-γ and IL-18 were sys-
tematically increased in serum of ZIKV-infected mice. Interestingly, the virus was also
detected in testicles of infected mice. In line with its in vitro anti-ZIKV activity, 7DMA reduced
viremia and delayed virus-induced morbidity and mortality in infected mice, which also vali-
dates this small animal model to assess the in vivo efficacy of novel ZIKV inhibitors. Since
AG129 mice can generate an antibody response, and have been used in dengue vaccine
studies, the model can also be used to assess the efficacy of ZIKV vaccines.
Author Summary
A robust cell-based antiviral assay was developed that allows to screen for and validate
novel inhibitors of Zika virus (ZIKV) replication. The viral polymerase inhibitor 7-deaza-
2’-C-methyladenosine (7DMA) was identified as a potent ZIKV inhibitor. A mouse model
for ZIKV infections, which was validated for antiviral studies, demonstrated that 7DMA
markedly delays virus-induced disease in this model.

 Introduction
Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, was first isolated from a febrile Rhesus monkey
in the Zika Forest in Uganda in 1947 [1]. During the last 5 decades sporadic ZIKV infections of
humans were reported in Gabon, Nigeria, Senegal, Malaysia, Cambodia and Micronesia
[2,3,4], leading to a benign febrile disease called Zika fever. The latter is characterized by head-
ache, maculopapular rash, fever, arthralgia, malaise, retro-orbital pain and vomiting [5,6]. In
2007, an epidemic of fever and rash associated with ZIKV infection was reported in Microne-
sia. During this outbreak 185 cases of ZIKV infections were confirmed. The seroprevalence in
the affected region was 73% [7]. During the more recent ZIKV outbreak in French Polynesia
[FP] between October 2013 and February 2014 over 30,000 people sought medical care [8,9].
Since then, ZIKV has spread to new areas in the Pacific, including New Caledonia, the Cook
Islands, and Chile’s Easter Island [7,10]. As of 2015 ZIKV is causing an epidemic in Central
and South America with an increasing number of cases reported particularly in Brazil, Colom-
bia and El Salvador [11–14], demonstrating that this is a truly emerging human pathogen.
Hundreds of cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome have been reported in the wake of ZIKV infec-
tions [15,16,17]. As a result of a marked increase in the number of cases of microcephaly
among infants born to virus-infected women, Zika has been declared a public health emer-
gency of national importance in Brazil [16,17,18]. In addition, an increasing number of travel-
ers returning sick from endemic regions were diagnosed with ZIKV [19–24]. The Aedes aegypti
mosquito, the primary vector for ZIKV transmission, is expanding in all (sub-)tropical regions
of the world and was recently reported to be present in California, USA [25].
There is neither a vaccine nor a specific antiviral therapy for the prevention or treatment of
infections by ZIKV. The increasing incidence of Zika fever stresses the need for both preventive
and therapeutic measures. We here report on the establishment of (i) a panel of assays that
allow to identify inhibitors of ZIKV replication as well as (ii) a robust animal model of ZIKV
infection with brain involvement. The viral polymerase inhibitor 7-deaza-2’-C-methyladeno-
sine (7DMA) was identified as an inhibitor of in vitro ZIKV replication and was shown to
reduce viremia and to delay the time to disease progression in virus-infected mice.
Materials and Methods
Compounds
Ribavirin, 1-(β-D-ribofuranosyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide (Virazole; RBV) was pur-
chased from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, USA). 2’-C-methylcytidine (2’CMC) and
7-deaza-2'-C-methyl-D-adenosine (7DMA) were purchased from Carbosynth (Berkshire, UK).
Favipiravir (6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide; T-705) and its defluorinated ana-
logue T-1105 (3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide) were obtained as custom synthesis products
from abcr GmbH (Karlsruhe, Germany).
Cells and viruses
ZIKV (strain MR766, passaged five times in the insect cell line C6/36) was obtained from the
European Virus Archive (EVA; http://www.european-virus-archive.com/viruses/zika-virus-
strain-mr766). Lyophilized virus was reconstituted in DMEM and virus stocks were generated
on C6/36 mosquito cell cultures (ATCC CRL-1660) grown in Leibowitz medium supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA) and 20 nM HEPES at
28°C, without CO2. At the time ZIKV caused a complete cytopathic effect (CPE) [d5-d7 post
infection; pi] the supernatant was harvested and viral titers were determined by endpoint titra-
tion on Vero cells (African Green monkey kidney cells; ECACC), Vero E6 cells (Vero C1008;

 ATCC CRL-1586) and BHK-J21 cells (baby hamster kidney cells; ATCC CCL-10). For end
point titrations, cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 5×103 or 104 cells/well in 100 μL assay
medium and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, 100 μL of ZIKV was added to each
well, after which the virus was serially diluted (1:2). Following 5 days of incubation, culture
medium was discarded and replaced with (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-
phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium; MTS) and the absorbance was measured at 498 nm
following a 1.5h-incubation period. Subsequently, cultures were fixed with ethanol and stained
with 1% Giemsa staining solution (solution of azure B/azure II-eosin/methylene blue 1:12:2
(w/w/w) in glycerol/methanol 5:24 (v/v); total dye content: 0.6% (w/w) Sigma-Aldrich). The
different cell types as well as ZIKV tested negative for mycoplasma.
CPE-reduction assay
Vero cells were grown in growth medium, consisting of MEM (Life Technologies) supplemented
with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 0.075% sodium bicarbonate (Life Technologies). Antivi-
ral assays were performed using the same medium except that 10% FCS was replaced with 2%
FCS, referred to as ‘assay medium’. Vero cells were seeded at a density of 104 cells/well in a
96-well plate in 100 μL assay medium and allowed to adhere overnight. To each well 100 μl of
culture medium containing 50% cell culture infectious doses (i.e., CCID50) of ZIKV was added,
after which 2-fold serial dilutions of the compounds were added. Following 5 days of incubation
CPE was determined by means of the MTS readout method and by microscopic evaluation of
fixed and stained cells. In parallel, cell cultures were incubated in the presence of compound and
absence of virus to evaluate a potential cytotoxic effect. The 50% effective concentration (EC50),
which is defined as the compound concentration that is required to inhibit virus-induced CPE
by 50%, and 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50), which is defined as the compound concentra-
tion that is required to inhibit the cell growth by 50%, was visually determined. The Z’ factor was
calculated by the following formula 1-[3×(SDCC+SDVC)/(ODCC-ODVC)]; VC, virus control; CC,
cell control.
Virus yield reduction assay
Vero cells were seeded at a density of 5×104 cells/well in 96-well plates in growth medium and
allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with 100 μL
CCID50 (MOI~0.2) of ZIKV in assay medium for 1 h at 37°C. Next, cells were washed 3 times
with PBS and 2-fold serial dilutions of the compounds were added. Supernatant was harvested
at day 4 pi and stored at -80°C until further use. The EC50 value, which is defined as the com-
pound concentration that is required to inhibit viral RNA replication by 50%, was determined
using logarithmic interpolation.
Viral kinetics and time-of-drug addition studies
Vero cells were seeded at a density of 2×105 cells/well in 24-well plate in growth medium and
allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with ZIKV at an
MOI~1 in assay medium for 30 min at 37°C. After the incubation, cells were washed twice with
PBS, after which assay medium was added to the cells. Cells were harvested at 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,
14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 hours pi and stored at -80°C until further use. For the time-of-drug
addition studies, cells were seeded and infected as described above and 7DMA (178 μM) or
ribavirin (209 μM) was added to the medium at different time points pi (see above). Cells were
harvested at 24 hours pi and stored at -80°C until further use.

 Plaque reduction assay
Vero cells were cultured in growth medium. Cells were incubated with ZIKV for 1 h, washed
and overlaid with a mixture of 2% (w/v) carboxymethylcellullose (Sigma Aldrich) and MEM
supplemented with 2% FCS, 4 mM L-glutamine and 0.15% sodium bicarbonate. Two-fold
serial dilutions of compounds were made in the overlay medium. Cells were fixed and stained
using a 10% v/v formaldehyde solution and a 1% methylene blue solution, respectively. Infec-
tious virus titer (PFU/mL) was determined using the following formula: number of
plaques × dilution factor × (1/inoculation volume).
Immunofluorescence assay
Vero cells were infected with ZIKV as described for the virus yield reduction assay. After removal
of the virus, 2-fold serial dilution (starting at 89 μM) of 7DMA was added to the cells. At 72 h pi,
cells were subsequently fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS and washed with PBS supple-
mented with 2% BSA. Anti-Flavivirus Group Antigen Antibody clone D1-4G2-4-15 (Millipore)
and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies) were used to detect ZIKV antigens in
infected cells. Cell nuclei were stained using DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-fenylindool; Life Technologies)
and read out was performed using an ArrayScan XTI High Content Analysis Reader (Thermo
Scientific). The EC50 value, which is defined as the compound concentration that is required to
inhibit viral antigen expression by 50%, was determined using logarithmic interpolation.
RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR
RNA was isolated from 100–150 μl supernatant using the NucleoSpin RNA virus kit (Filter Ser-
vice, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA from infected cells was isolated
using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, The Netherlands), according to the manufacturer’s protocol,
and eluted in 50 μL RNase-free water. During RT-qPCR the ZIKV NS1 region (nucleotides
2472–2565) was amplified using primers 5’-TGA CTC CCC TCG TAG ACT G-3’ and 3’-CTC
TCC TTC CAC TGA TTT CCA C-5’ and a Double-Quenched Probe 5’-6-FAM/AGA TCC
CAC /ZEN/AAA TCC CCT CTT CCC/3’IABkFQ/ (Integrated DNA Technologies, IDT). Viral
RNA was quantified using serial dilutions of a standard curve consisting of a synthesized gene

A mouse model of Zika virus infection
All experiments were performed with approval of and under the guidelines of the Ethical Com-
mittee of the University of Leuven [P087-2014]. Virus stock was produced as described earlier
and additionally concentrated by ultracentrifugation. Infectious virus titers (PFU/ml) were deter-
mined by performing plaque assays on Vero cells. 129/Sv mice deficient in both interferon (IFN)-
α/β and IFN-γ receptors (AG129 mice; male, 8–14 weeks of age) were inoculated intraperitoneally
(ip; 200 μL) with different inoculums ranging from 1×101–1×105 PFU/mL of ZIKV. Mice were
observed daily for body weight change and the development of virus-induced disease. In case of a
body weight loss of >20% and/or severe illness, mice were euthanized with pentobarbital (Nem-
butal). Blood was collected by cardiac puncture and tissues (spleen, kidney, liver and brain) were
collected in 2-mL tubes containing 2.8 mm zirconium oxide beads (Precellys/Bertin Technolo-
gies) after transcardial perfusion using PBS. Subsequently, RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen) was added to
the Precellys tubes and tissue homogenates were prepared using an automated homogenizer

 (Precellys24; Bertin Technologies). Homogenates were cleared by centrifugation and total RNA
was extracted from the supernatant using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen), according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol. For serum samples, the NucleoSpin RNA virus kit (Filter Service) was used to
isolate viral RNA. Viral copy numbers were quantified by RT-qPCR, as described earlier.
Histology
For histological examination, tissues (harvested at d13-15 pi) were subsequently fixed in 4%
formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin, essen-
tially as described before [26]. Anti-Flavivirus Group Antigen Antibody, clone D1-4G2-4-15
(Millipore) was used to detect ZIKV antigens in tissue samples.
Detection of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
Induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was analyzed in 20 μL serum using
the mouse cytokine 20-plex antibody bead kit (ProcartaPlex Mouse Th1/Th2 & Chemokine
Panel I [EPX200-26090-901]), which measures the expression of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-18,
CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL3 (MIP-1α), CCL4 (MIP-1β), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL7 (MCP-3), CCL11
(Eotaxin), CXCL1 (GRO-α), CXCL2 (MIP-2), CXCL10 (IP-10), GM-CSF, IL-1β, IL12p70, IL-
13, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5. Measurements were performed using a Luminex 100 instrument
(Luminex Corp., Austin, TX, USA) and were analyzed using a standard curve for each molecule
(ProcartaPlex). Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way ANOVA.
Evaluation of the activity of 7DMA in ZIKV-infected AG129 mice
AG129 mice (male, 8–14 weeks of age) were treated with either 50 mg/kg/day 7DMA resus-
pended in 0.5% or 0.2% sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC‐Na; n = 9) or vehicle (0.5% or
0.2% CMC‐Na; n = 9) once daily (QD) via oral gavage for 10 consecutive days. Since the bulk-
forming agent CMC has dehydrating properties [27], mice that received the drug (or vehicle)
formulated with 0.5% CMC received (on days 6–9) subcutaneous injections with 200 μL of
saline. One hour after the first treatment, mice were infected via the intraperitoneal route with
200 μL of a 1×104 PFU/ml stock of ZIKV. Blood was withdrawn from the tails at different days
pi. Viral RNA was extracted from 20 μL of serum using the RNA NucleoSpin RNA virus kit
(Filter Service) followed by viral RNA quantification by means of RT-qPCR. Statistical analysis
was performed using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test followed by the unpaired, two-tailed t-
test in Graph Pad Prism6. Inter-group survival was compared using the Log-rank (Mantel-
Cox) test. The in vivo efficacy of 7DMA was determined in two independent experimental ani-
mal studies. Evaluation of cytokine induction was performed using the ProcartaPlex Mouse
Simplex IP-10 (CXCL10), TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-18 kits. In an additional animal study, AG129
mice (male, 8–14 weeks of age) were treated with 50 mg/kg/day 7DMA resuspended in 0.2%
sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC‐Na; n = 6) or vehicle (0.2% CMC‐Na; n = 6) once daily
(QD) via oral gavage for 5 successive days (starting 2 days prior to infection) and infected ip
with 200 μL of a 1×104 PFU/ml stock of ZIKV. Animals were euthanized at day 5 pi and testi-
cles were collected and stored until further use.

 of ZIKV resulted in 100% cytopathic effect 5 days after infection (S1B Fig), as assessed by
microscopic evaluation as well as by the MTS readout method. The Z’ factor (a measure of sta-
tistical effect size to assess the quality of assays to be used for high-throughput screening pur-
poses; [28]) of the CPE-reduction assay was 0.68 based on 64 samples (from 8 independent
experiments) determined by the MTS readout method (S1C Fig). The assay is thus sufficiently
stringent and reproducible for high throughput screening purposes (see also S2 Fig). The CPE-
reduction assay was next employed to evaluate the potential anti-ZIKV activity of a selection of
known (+)ssRNA virus inhibitors (i.e. 2’-C-methylcytidine, 7-deaza-2'-C-methyladenosine,
ribavirin, T-705 and its analogue T-1105). All compounds resulted in a selective, dose-depen-
dent inhibitory effect on ZIKV replication (Table 1). The antiviral effect of these compounds
was confirmed in a virus yield reduction assay, a1.7log10 and 3.9log10 reduction in viral RNA
load at a concentration of 22 μM and �45 μM, respectively, was noted (Table 1 and Fig 1A).
Since 7DMA resulted in the largest therapeutic window (SI > 37; Table 1), the antiviral activity
of this compound was therefore next assessed in a plaque reduction assay and in an immuno-
fluorescence assay to detect viral antigens. The inhibitory effect of the compound in both assays
was in line with those of the CPE-reduction and virus yield reduction assay (Table 1, Fig 1A).
At a concentration of 11 μM, 7DMA almost completely blocked viral antigen expression (Fig
1B, left panel).
7DMA is, as its 5’-triphosphate metabolite, an inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA poly-
merases. Addition of the compound to infected cells could be delayed until ~10 hours pi with-
out much loss of antiviral potency; when first added at a later time point, the antiviral activity
was gradually lost. This is line with the observation that onset of intracellular ZIKV RNA pro-
duction was determined to occur at 10 to 12 hours pi (Fig 2). The reference compound ribavi-
rin (a triazole nucleoside with multiple proposed modes of action; [29]), in contrast, already
lost part of the antiviral activity when added at time points later than 4 hours pi (Fig 2).
Establishing a ZIKV infection model in mice
Intraperitoneal inoculation of IFN-α/β and IFN-γ receptor knockout mice (AG129) with as
low as 200 μL of a 1×101 PFU/ml stock of ZIKV resulted in virus-induced disease (see below)
and mice had to be euthanized at a MDE (mean day of euthanasia) of 18.5 days pi (Fig 3A).
Infection with higher inoculums (1×102–1×105 PFU/ml; 200 μL) resulted in a faster progres-
sion of the disease (MDE of 14 days pi) with the first signs of disease appearing at day 10 pi.
Surprisingly, inoculation of SCID mice with 200 μL of a 1×104 PFU/ml stock of ZIKV resulted

than AG129 mice (S3 Fig). Disease signs in AG129 mice included paralysis of the lower limbs,
body weight loss, hunched back and conjunctivitis. High levels of viral RNA were detected in
brain, spleen, liver and kidney from mice that were euthanized at day 13–15 pi (Fig 3B). Histo-
pathological analysis on tissues collected at day 13–15 pi revealed the accumulation of viral

 antigens in neurons of both the brain (Fig 4A) and the spinal cord (Fig 4D) as well as in hepato-
cytes (Fig 4E). Acute neutrophilic encephalitis (Fig 4C) was observed at the time of onset of
virus-induced morbidity. It was next assessed whether infection with ZIKV resulted in the
induction of a panel of 20 cytokines and chemokines at different time points pi (day 2, 3, 4 and
8; Figs 3C and 3D and S4A–S4G). In particular, levels of IFN-γ and IL-18 were increased sys-
tematically and significantly during the course of infection (Fig 3C and 3D), whereas levels of
IL-6, CCL2, CCL5, CCL7, CXCL1, CXCL10 and TNF-α first increased, reaching a peak level at
day 3 pi (CCL2, CXCL1, TNF-α; S4A–S4C Fig) or day 4 pi (IL-6, CCL7, CXCL10; S4D–S4F
Fig) pi and then gradually declined. Levels of CCL5 subsequently increased at day 2 pi, dropped
at day 3 pi, and gradually increased again at day 4 and 8 pi (S4G Fig).
7-deaza-2’-C-methyladenosine delays ZIKV-induced disease in AG129
mice
AG129 mice were infected with 200 μL of a 1×104 PFU/ml stock of ZIKV and were treated
once daily with 50 mg/kg/day of 7DMA or vehicle via oral gavage (Fig 5) [data from the two
independent experiments were not pooled since different amounts of CMC (respectively 0.5%
and 0.2%) were used for formulation]. Vehicle-treated mice had to be euthanized two weeks
after infection [MDE of 14.0 and 16.0 days, respectively]. 7DMA was well tolerated [no marked
changes in body weight mass, fur, consistency of the stool or behavior during the treatment
period] and markedly delayed virus-induced disease progression [MDE of 23.0 in the first

Discussion
The rapid geographical spread of ZIKV, particularly in Central and South America poses a seri-
ous public health concern given that infection with this virus is less benign than initially
thought. Hundreds of patients have been reported with Guillain-Barré syndrome [16,17]. Most
importantly, in Brazil a dramatic upsurge in the number of cases of microcephaly has been

deficient in both IFN-alpha/beta (IFN-α/β) and IFN-gamma (IFN-γ) receptors (AG129) were inoculated intraperitoneally with 200 μL
of different inoculums (ranging from 1×101–1×105 PFU/ml) of ZIKV. Mice were observed daily for body weight loss and the

 noted in children born to mothers infected with ZIKV. The annual rate of microcephaly in Bra-
zil has increased from 5.7 per 100 000 live births in 2014 to 99.7 per 100 000 in 2015 [16,17,18].
There is, hence, an urgent need to develop preventive and counteractive measures against this
truly neglected flavivirus member. We here report on the establishment of (i) in vitro assays
that will allow to identify novel inhibitors of ZIKV replication and (ii) a ZIKV infection model
in mice in which the potential efficacy of such inhibitors can be assessed. ZIKV was found to
replicate efficiently in Vero cells and to produce full CPE within a couple of days. The Z’ factor
that was calculated for a colorometric (MTS method) CPE-based screen indicated that this is a
robust assay that is amenable for high-throughput screening purposes. A plaque reduction, an
infectious virus yield and a viral RNA yield reduction assay as well as an immunofluorescent
antigen detection assay were established that will allow to validate the in vitro activity of hits
identified in CPE-based screenings. Productive infection of human dermal fibroblasts, epider-
mal keratinocytes and immature dendritic cells with the ZIKV has recently been reported [30].
However, Vero cells may be ideally suited for high throughput screening purposes, making
these cells most useful to confirm the antiviral activity of interesting inhibitors of viral replica-
tion. We employed the assays that we established to assess the potential anti-ZIKV activity of a
number of molecules with reported antiviral activity against other ssRNA viruses. In particular,
the nucleoside analogue 7DMA was identified to inhibit ZIKV replication with a potency that
was more or less comparable between the different in vitro assays. 7DMA was originally devel-
oped by Merck Research Laboratories as an inhibitor of hepatitis C virus replication [31], but
was also shown to inhibit the replication of multiple flaviviruses, [i.e. dengue virus, yellow fever
virus as well as West Nile and tick-borne encephalitis virus] with EC50 values ranging between
5 and 15 μM, which is thus comparable to the EC50 values for inhibition of in vitro ZIKV repli-
cation [31,32,33]. In line with its presumed mechanism of action, i.e. inhibition as its 5’-tri-
phosphate of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, time-of-drug-addition experiments

 revealed that the compound acts at a time point that coincides with the onset of intracellular
viral RNA replication.
To assess the in vivo efficacy of ZIKV inhibitors, we established a model of ZIKV infection
in mice. AG129 mice proved highly susceptible to ZIKV infections; even an inoculum of ~10
PFU/ml resulted in virus induced-morbidity and mortality. Although ZIKV-infected SCID
mice (deficient in both T and B lymphocytes) developed severe disease requiring euthanasia
(paralysis of the lower limbs, body weight loss, hunched back), these mice were more resistant
to ZIKV infection than AG129 mice. SCID mice succumbed to infection roughly 26 days later
than AG129 mice when inoculated with the same viral inoculum. Thus, ZIKV infections in
mice are mostly controlled by the interferon response rather than by lymphocytes, indicating
that the innate immune response to ZIKV is critical. AG129 mice have been shown to be highly
susceptible to infection with other flaviviruses; in particular allowing the development of

 dengue virus infection models in mice [32,34,35]. At the time of virus-induced morbidity and
mortality, ZIKV was detected in multiple organs such as kidney, liver and spleen, but also in
the brain and spinal cord. The latter is in line with the observation that infected mice developed
acute neutrophilic encephalitis with movement impairment and paralysis of the limbs. Brain
involvement in ZIKV-infected mice may be relevant for brain-related pathologies in some
ZIKV-infected humans [16,17]. Interestingly, the virus was also detected at high levels in the
testicles of infected mice. A few cases of sexual transmission of the ZIKV in humans have been
reported [36,37]; the observation that the virus replicates in the testicles in mice may suggest
that the virus can also replicate in human testicle tissue thus explaining sexual transmission.
Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-18, IL-6, TNF-α) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL5,
CCL7, CXCL1, CXCL10) were found to be increased in sera of ZIKV-infected mice, indicating
that infection causes systemic inflammation. In particular IFN-γ and IL-18 were continuously
increased during the course of infection; both cytokines could therefore potentially function as
predictive markers of disease progression and disease severity in this mouse model. Whether
these cytokines are also upregulated during the acute phase of the infection in humans remains
to be studied. Of note, the fact that ZIKV infection leads to the production of IL-18 suggests
that the inflammasome is activated during the course of infection. Surprisingly, we could detect
increased levels of IL-18, but not of IL-1β, which is also produced upon activation of the
inflammasome [38]. To our knowledge, the observation that the inflammasome could be impli-
cated in ZIKV infection is unprecedented.
Recently, a small study was reported involving 6 ZIKV-infected patients in which during
the acute phase 11 cytokines/chemokines were found to be significantly increased, of which 7
were also increased during recovery [39]. Despite the fact that immunocompromised AG129
mice have an altered cytokine metabolism and were infected with the prototype ZIKV MR766
strain belonging to a different lineage than the one infecting the Latin American patients (Afri-
can versus Asian, respectively), similarities in cytokine expression were noted between both
studies. IL-6, CCL5 and CXCL10 were significantly increased in ZIKV-infected patients as well
as in the infected mice. In the ZIKV-infected patients IFN-γ levels, which were markedly
increased in ZIKV-infected mice, were also increased during both the acute and the reconvales-
cent phase of the infection, albeit non-significantly. Likewise, TNF-α levels, which were
increased early in infection in mice, were (non-significantly) increased during the acute phase
of infection in the patients. More studies are necessary to assess whether the cytokine profile in
these 6 patients is representative for larger groups.
Treatment of ZIKV-infected mice with 7DMA significantly reduced viremia (between day 3
and 8 post infection) and delayed virus-induced morbidity and mortality. The compound was
very well tolerated in mice, which is in line with earlier reports [31]. The reduction in viremia
and, hence, the delay of virus-induced disease was relatively modest, which is not surprising
given the relatively weak in vitro activity of the compound as compared to, for example, the
EC50 values (sub μM or even nM range) of most HCV inhibitors. Most importantly, the use of
this compound allowed to validate the ZIKV mouse model to assess the efficacy of ZIKV inhib-
itors. Whether 7DMA (or related analogues) may have future in the control of ZIKV infections
remains to be explored. AG129 mice have been used as well in the development of DENV vac-
cines, the DENV AG120 mouse models offer multiple disease parameters to evaluate protec-
tion by candidate vaccines [40]. Hence, the ZIKV mouse model presented here may also serve
to study the efficacy of vaccine strategies against the ZIKV.
In conclusion, we here report on a panel of in vitro cellular assays that will allow to run
large-scale antiviral screening campaigns against ZIKV and to validate the antiviral activity of
hit compounds. A number of molecules, including the viral polymerase inhibitor 7DMA, were
found to inhibit the in vitro replication of ZIKV. Hence, 7DMA can be used as a reference

 compound/comparator in future studies. Moreover, a robust ZIKV mouse infection model was
established; 7DMA delayed virus-induced mortality and, hence, validates this model for antivi-
ral studies. Moreover, the model may be useful to study the efficacy of vaccination strategies
against the ZIKV.
