Abstract
Few studies have assessed postoperative trends in opioid cessation and predictors of persistent 
opioid use after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA). Preoperatively 
574 TKA and THA patients completed validated, self-report measures of pain, functioning and 
mood and were longitudinally assessed for 6-months post-surgery. Among patients who were 
opioid naïve the day of surgery, 8.2% of TKA and 4.3% of THA patients were using opioids at 6 
months. In comparison, 53.3% of TKA and 34.7% of THA patients who reported opioid use the 
day of surgery continued to use opioids at 6 months. Patients taking >60 mg oral morphine 
equivalents preoperatively had an 80% likelihood of persistent use postoperatively. Day of surgery 
predictors for 6-month opioid use by opioid naïve patients included greater overall body pain 
(p=0.002), greater affected joint pain (knee/hip) (p=0.034), and greater catastrophizing (p=0.010). 
For both opioid naïve and opioid users on day of surgery, decreases in overall body pain from 
baseline to 6 months were associated with decreased odds of being on opioids at 6 months 
(aOR=0.72, p=0.050; aOR=0.62, p=0.001); however, change in affected joint pain (knee/hip) was 
not predictive of opioid use (aOR=0.99, p=0.939; aOR=1.00, p=0.963). In conclusion, many 
patients taking opioids prior to surgery continue to use opioids after arthroplasty and some opioid 
naïve patients remained on opioids; however persistent opioid use was not associated with change 
in joint pain. Given growing concerns about chronic opioid use, the reasons for persistent opioid 
use and perioperative prescribing of opioids deserve further study.

 [10; 12; 15] and, with the aging population, the number of arthroplasties conducted each 
year is projected to increase at a staggering rate [13]. Whereas opioids are a mainstay for 
managing acute postoperative pain [4] and are the primary analgesic modality for TKA and 
THA after discharge, clinicians and researchers are now more critical of long-term use of 
opioids for chronic pain [6; 8; 16], including osteoarthritis[11; 17]. What is not well 
understood is how opioid use changes following arthroplasty and what factors predict their 
persistent opioid use.
Despite growing scientific and clinical interest in opioids, surprisingly few studies have 
explored opioid use in patients undergoing surgical interventions for the treatment of pain. 
The limited data on opioid cessation following arthroplasty suggests that the majority of 
patients discontinue opioids soon after surgery. For instance, among a national sample of 
patients who underwent a TKA, 14% of patients taking opioids prior to TKA and 3% of 
opioid naïve patients (i.e., patients started on opioids postoperatively) continued opioids at 
12 months [7]. Studies have also identified several predictors of opioid use following 
arthroplasty. Franklin and colleagues used a large national dataset to assess persistent opioid 
use following TKA and found that opioid use prior to arthroplasty and persistent pain at the 
surgical site were associated with having an opioid prescription 12 months post arthroplasty 
[7]. Similarly, using a database from the Mayo Clinic, Singh and colleagues separately 
analyzed TKA [20] and THA [19] outcomes. Female gender [19; 20], younger age [19; 20], 
higher BMI [19; 20], and pre-operative anxiety [20] were associated with opioid use 2 and 5 
years post arthroplasty. While these findings are novel, the researchers were unable to 
account for preoperative opioid use in their analyses, did not include measures of pain and 
functioning, and were limited to billing data for assessments of anxiety and depression.
Well-designed prospective studies that assess patterns of opioid use and predictors of 
continued use are needed in order to enhance pre- and post-operative pain management. To 
this end, the current study of prospectively collected data has three primary aims and 
hypotheses: (1) To explore the natural course of opioid use in opioid naïve patients, as well 
as patients taking opioids preoperatively (we hypothesized most patients would achieve 
opioid cessation at 6 months), (2) To identify preoperative predictors of persistent opioid use 
6 months post TKA and THA (hypothesized predictors included opioid use the day of 
surgery, greater pain at baseline, baseline symptoms of depression and anxiety), and (3) To 
examine how change in knee/hip pain from baseline to 6 months predicts opioid use at 6 
months (we hypothesized that less improvement/pain relief in the affected joint (knee/hip) at 
6 months would be associated with persistent opioid use).
2. Methods and Materials
2.1 Study Setting and Participants
This study is a secondary analysis of data from a prospective outcome study in patients 
undergoing TKA and THA [3]. Data collection and subsequent analyses were approved by 
the Institutional Review Board at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI). Between 
March 2010 and May 2013, patients were recruited from either a preoperative arthroplasty 
workshop or from the preoperative waiting area on the day of surgery. Patients were eligible 
to participate if they were scheduled for primary, unilateral TKA or THA and at least 18

 years old. Exclusion criteria included being a non-English speaker, inability to provide 
written informed consent, bilateral arthroplasty, revision arthroplasty, and prisoners. All 
eligible participants completed a battery of validated self-report questionnaires preoperative 
on the day of their surgery and were followed longitudinally to assess surgical outcomes. 
Post arthroplasty data were collected at 1 and 3-months via telephone, and 6 months by mail. 
The predictors of arthroplasty outcomes have previously been published [3]. There were 576 
eligible patients included in the current study. Two patients had missing data on current 
opioid use so they were excluded from the analyses, resulting in a final sample of 574 
participants.
2.2 Measures
2.2.1 Preoperative and postoperative opioid use—Preoperative opioid use was 
recorded by a research assistant using a list of current medications obtained from a chart 
review of the patient’s medical records. All pain medications were reviewed with the patient 
to ensure accuracy, including the average daily dose. Patients were considered to be using 
opioid medication preoperatively if they confirmed the documented use of opioids. Patients 
who reported no opioid use the day of surgery were considered “opioid naïve,” which was 
confirmed both by chart review and verbal confirmation with the patient on the day of 
surgery. Postoperative opioid use was assessed at all follow up time points by reviewing 
current medications with the patient. Patients were considered to be using opioid medication 
postoperatively if they confirmed the use of opioids. For all patients reporting opioid use, a 
24-hour oral morphine equivalency (OME) dose was calculated preoperatively and at all 
postoperative follow-up assessments. Patients were asked to confirm the correct dose and for 
as needed medications the average number of pills per day was determined.
2.2.2 Joint pain (Knee/Hip)—The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities 
Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) is a 24-item standardized questionnaire that is widely used 
to assess pain, stiffness, and function specific to the joints in patients with osteoarthritis of 
the knee and hip[1]. The WOMAC is divided into 3 subscales including pain (five items; 
range 0–20), stiffness (2 items; range 0–8), and physical functioning (17 items; range 0–68). 
The subscales were individually analyzed for descriptive and outcomes data.
2.2.3 Overall body pain—The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is a self-report scale that 
assesses both the severity of pain and impact of pain on daily functioning [5]. Overall pain 
severity was assessed using a 4-item subscale that asks about overall body pain at its worst 
and least in the last week, average pain, and pain right now. For each item, participants were 
asked to rate their overall pain on a scale of 0 (No Pain) to 10 (Pain as bad as you can 
imagine) [23]. The average of the four scores was used as a single composite measure of 
pain severity.
2.2.4 Symptoms of depression and anxiety—Depressive and anxiety symptoms were 
assessed using two 7-item subscales from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(HADS)[24]. The HADS is a brief and widely-used instrument to measure psychological 
distress in general and medical populations. A score on either subscale of 0 to 7 is 
considered within the normal range; a score of 8 to10 is suggestive of the presence of

 anxiety/depression; and a score of 11 or higher indicates a high probability that anxiety/
depression is present.
2.2.5 Pain catastrophizing—Pain catastrophizing was assessed using the 6-item 
catastrophizing subscale from the Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ) [18]. The CSQ 
catastrophizing subscale is a widely used scale that measures the extent that patients view 
pain as a threat and evaluate their ability to cope with pain [22]. Patients used a 7-point scale 
to rate how often they think like each item from 0 (never think that) to 6 (always think that).
2.3 Statistical analysis plan
All analyses were conducted with Stata version 13.1[21]. Baseline phenotypic differences 
between those on versus off opioids the day of surgery were examined using t-tests or chi-
square tests as appropriate. To show the natural trajectory of opioid use following TKA or 
THA, we calculated the percentage of patients on opioids at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 
months postoperatively for those taking and not taking opioids preoperatively (baseline). 
Next, univariate logistic regression models were conducted to compare the preoperative 
phenotypes of the patients not taking opioids 6 months after surgery to the patients with 
persistent opioid use. To examine how changes in pain from day of surgery to six months 
were related to opioid use at 6 months, change scores were calculated subtracting WOMAC 
knee/hip pain subscale and overall body pain (BPI) at 6 months from WOMAC knee/hip 
pain and overall body pain on day of surgery, respectively. These change scores were then 
included as predictors of opioid use at 6 months in two multivariate logistic regression 
models.
3. Results
3.1 Baseline phenotypic differences between participants reporting opioid use on the day 
of surgery (TKA or THA) compared to those not using opioids
Across the entire sample, 28.99% (N=167) of participants reported current opioid use the 
day of their TKA or THA. Participants’ already taking opioids on the day of their TKA or 
THA reported a worse phenotypic profile compared to participants not taking opioids the 
day of surgery. Current opioid users reported higher levels of pain in their surgery site (p 
<0.001), stiffness (p <0.001), functional impairment (p <0.001), overall body pain (p 
<0.001), and symptoms of depression (p <0.001), anxiety (p = 0.002), and catastrophizing (p 
= 0.001). Current opioid users were more likely to be younger (p < 0.001) and less likely to 
be Caucasian (p = 0.007). There were no significant differences in gender (p = 0.127) or 
type of surgery (p = 0.213). Please see Supplemental Table 1 for the details of these 
differences.
3.2 Natural course of opioid use following TKA and THA
To understand the natural course of opioid use following TKA and THA, opioid use at 1, 3 
and 6 months was reported (See Table 1). Knee arthroplasty patients reporting opioid use the 
day of surgery reported greater opioid use at 6 months (53.3%) than those not taking opioids 
the day of surgery (8.2%) (p < 0.001). Hip arthroplasty patients reporting opioid use the day 
of surgery also reported greater opioid use at 6 months (34.7%) compared to those not taking

 opioids prior to surgery (4.3%) (p < 0.001). Further, 42% of opioid naïve TKA patients on 
opioids at 3 months were still on opioids at 6 months. For opioid naïve THA patients, 29% 
of those on opioids at 3 months were still on opioids at 6 months. In a logistic regression 
model controlling for age, race and gender, opioid use at 3 months was associated with a 
relative risk of 56 (p < 0.001) of being on opioids at 6 months. In the same model for opioid 
naïve THA patients, opioid use at 3 months was associated with a relative risk of 12 (p = 
0.004) of being on opioids at 6 months.
3.3 Baseline predictors of persistent opioid use 6 months post arthroplasty
In order to identify baseline predictors of persistent opioid use, we compared the 
preoperative phenotypes of those patients whose opioid use persisted 6 months after surgery 
to those patients not taking opioids at 6 months (See Table 2). On the day of surgery, 
univariate analyses demonstrated that persistent opioid users at 6 months reported worse 
pain in their surgery site (p < 0.001), greater functional impairment (p = 0.002), more 
stiffness (p = 0.001), increased overall body pain (p < 0.001), more symptoms of depression 
(p = 0.006), and higher levels of catastrophizing (p = 0.001). There was no difference in who 
continued to take opioids at 6 months based on age (p = 0.509), gender (p = 0.074), ethnicity 
(p = 0.531), or type of surgery (p = 0.087). Further, a univariate logistic regression revealed 
that preoperative opioid dose (OME) was significantly predictive of opioid use at 6 months 
(OR = 1.07, p < 0.001). A plot of opioid dose (OME) at day of surgery against the predicted 
probability of opioid use at 6 months shows that the probability of opioid use at 6 months 
increases as OME increases, with a pre-surgical OME of 60 or greater being associated with 
an 80% or greater predicted probability of opioid use at 6 months (Figure 1).
As a secondary analysis, we examined univariate baseline predictors of 6-month opioid use 
for those on opioids on day of surgery and opioid naïve patients separately (see Table 3). For 
those on opioids on day of surgery, knee surgery (p = 0.045) and higher preoperative opioid 
dose (OME, p = 0.010) were predictive of 6-month opioid use. For opioid naïve patients, on 
day of surgery having greater overall body pain (p = 0.002), greater joint pain (knee/hip) (p 
= 0.034), and greater catastrophizing (p = 0.010) were predictive of 6-month opioid use.
3.4 Change in knee/hip pain from baseline to 6 months as a predictor of opioid use at 6 
months
A multivariate logistic regression model was conducted predicting opioid use at 6 months 
from change in knee/hip pain and overall body pain from baseline to 6 months (Table 4). 
Baseline pain scores, age, race, gender, opioid use at baseline, and type of surgery were 
included as covariates in the model. Overall body pain at baseline (Adjusted Odds Ratio 
(aOR) = 1.71, p < 0.001) and opioid use at baseline (aOR = 9.27, p < 0.001) were predictive 
of opioid use at 6 months. Further, decreased overall body pain was associated with lower 
odds of being on opioids at 6 months (aOR = 0.68, p < 0.001), while contrary to our 
hypothesis change in joint pain (knee/hip) was not predictive of opioid use at 6 months (aOR 
= 1.01, p = 0.900).
As a secondary analysis, separate multivariate logistic regression models were conducted for 
opioid naïve patients and those on opioids on day of surgery (Table 5). For those not on

 opioids at day of surgery, higher preoperative overall body pain (aOR = 2.76, p < 0.001) and 
knee arthroplasty (vs. THA; aOR = 3.89, p = 0.044) were predictive of opioid use at 6 
months. Further, decreased overall body pain from baseline to 6 months (aOR = 0.72, p = 
0.050) was associated with lower odds of being on opioids at 6 months, while change in 
joint pain (knee/hip) was not predictive of opioid use at 6 months (aOR = 0.99, p = 0.939). 
For those on opioids preoperatively, only decreases in overall body pain was associated with 
lower odds of being on opioids at 6 months (aOR = 0.62, p = 0.001). Change in affected 
joint pain was again not predictive (aOR= 1.00, p = 0.963).
4. Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine predictors of opioid use in patients 
taking opioids preoperatively and opioid naïve patients, and to include changes in joint pain 
(knee/hip) and overall pain as predictors of persistent opioid use. We would expect that after 
a successful surgical intervention, opioid use should no longer be necessary as the pain in 
the joint improves. However, the current data emphasize that the relationship between 
persistent opioid use following arthroplasty is far more complex than improvement in pain in 
the affected joint.
4.1 Patterns of opioid cessation following TKA and THA differ between patients taking 
opioids preoperatively and opioid naïve patients
These data highlight the importance of understanding the natural trajectory of opioid use 
following TKA or THA, especially taking into account how cessation rates differ depending 
on opioid use the day of surgery. Overall, patients showed a trend towards opioid cessation. 
Despite this, patients taking opioids preoperatively were far more likely to report persistent 
opioid use at 6 months (53.3% TKA, 34.7% THA) than were opioid naïve patients (8.2% 
TKA, 4.3% THA). While it was not unexpected that preoperative opioid use was associated 
with persistent use at 6 months, the rates of opioid use following arthroplasty are higher than 
those previously reported. A similar study in TKA patients found that14% of patients 
already taking opioids prior to TKA reported continued opioid use at 12 months [7]. One 
possible explanation for the lower cessation rates is that the assessment period post 
arthroplasty differed (6 months versus 12 months). However, there is no evidence of 
meaningful change in pain beyond the 6-month postoperative time point. This study also 
showed that a percentage of opioid naïve patients started on opioid post-operatively to 
manage acute pain will continue to use opioids well after the surgical recovery period. On 
one hand, 4.3%—8.2% is a relatively small percentage, suggesting that prescribing opioids 
for acute pain following arthroplasty in opioid naïve patients does not pose a significant risk 
for long-term opioid use. On the other hand, a total of 3.48 million TKAs and almost 
600,000 THAs are projected by 2030 [14], thereby potentially leading to more than 250,000 
new chronic opioid users in the US each year.

 4.2 Preoperative characteristics associated with persistent opioid use at 6 months were 
worse pain and functioning, symptoms of depression, greater catastrophizing, and higher 
preoperative opioid dose
Preoperative factors associated with persistent opioid use at 6 months included worse pain in 
the surgery site (joint pain), greater functional impairment, more stiffness, overall body pain, 
and symptoms of depression and catastrophizing. Importantly, our data suggest that for 
patients taking opioids preoperatively, an average daily dose of greater than 60 mg OME 
was independently associated with persistent opioid use (Figure 1). That is, patients on high 
dose opioids had an 80% or greater predicted probability of being on opioids at 6 months. 
One possibility is that higher doses of opioids make opioid cessation especially challenging, 
regardless of the outcome of a surgical procedure. For instance, these patients may be more 
likely to struggle with therapeutic opioid dependence or opioid induced hyperalgesia making 
it difficult to discontinue opioids even after improvement in joint pain. High dose opioids 
pose significant risks, including morbidity and mortality [2]; therefore, future studies should 
consider the factors that influence opioid use in patients taking high doses the day of 
surgery.
4.3 Changes in joint pain did not predict opioid use at 6 months
Counter to our hypotheses and previous studies [7], we found no association between change 
in joint pain (knee/hip) and persistent opioid use (Tables 4 and 5). Previous studies have 
used persistent opioid use as a surrogate for failed surgery, thereby assuming that the reason 
for persistent use was inadequate relief of joint pain. The results from the current study 
question this interpretation and suggest that persistent opioid use following arthroplasty may 
not be a reliable proxy for poor surgical outcomes. There are several hypotheses to consider 
as to why patients continue opioids despite improvement in their joint pain. One possibility 
is that opioids are being used to treat other pain. That is, perhaps patients were taking 
opioids the day of surgery not only for pain in their knee or hip but also for secondary pain. 
Similarly, opioid naïve patients who reported opioid use at 6 months may have developed 
new pain following arthroplasty and continued to medicate the new pain with opioids. In 
partial support of this, we found that decreases in overall body pain from baseline to 6 
months most strongly predicted persistent opioid cessation. Another possibility is that 
persistent opioid users, especially those on high doses, are either dependent or self-
medicating for affective distress, making opioid cessation unlikely regardless of the surgical 
outcome. Differentiating the reasons why people take opioids is a critical next step towards 
understanding why opioid use persists following a successful surgery.
4.4 Participants’ already taking opioids the day of surgery have a worse phenotypic profile 
compared to opioid naïve patients
Opioid use on the day of surgery was associated with a worse clinical profile, including 
higher pain, worse functioning, and more symptoms of affective distress. Although not 
central to our main hypotheses, these results add to the growing literature that continues to 
find phenotypic difference between patients who report opioid use and opioid naïve patients 
[6]. For example, in a study of patients presenting to a chronic pain clinic, current opioid use

 was associated with higher pain severity, lower levels of functioning and significant affective 
distress [9].
4.5 Clinical implications
Pain management following TKA and THA is complex. In order to provide optimal short 
and long-term pain management, it is critical for physicians to understand and discuss 
patients’ pre-surgical and postsurgical opioid use. This study identified several pre-surgical 
factors that are “red-flags” for persistent opioid use 6-months post arthroplasty, including 
high dose opioid use prior to surgery and greater overall body pain. Pre-surgical 
interventions should include a better assessment of comorbid pain conditions and patients on 
high dose opioids may have better outcomes if they are tapered to a lower dose. Among 
patients who were opioid naïve the day of surgery, opioid use at 3 months was associated 
with a 56 (TKA) and 12 (THA) times greater risk of persistent opioids use at 6 months. 
These data support developing better monitoring of opioid use prior to 3 months to consider 
points of possible intervention. Though it is impractical for orthopedic surgeons and primary 
care physicians to track and counsel all patients about opioid use after arthroplasty, assessing 
opioid use at multiple time points may help guide physicians as to when someone is falling 
outside of the expected postoperative opioid use.
4.5 Strengths and limitations
Strengths of this study include the rich preoperative phenotyping battery that allowed us to 
assess opioid use and dose, site-specific pain and functioning, overall pain, and symptoms of 
depression and anxiety, in addition to demographic characteristics. This approach expands 
on previous research in this area that did not include preoperative opioid use [19; 20] or 
differentiate pain in the surgical site from overall body pain [7]. Another strength was the 
longitudinal design and the inclusion of multiple time points. Previous studies were limited 
to preoperative data and postoperative outcomes 2 and 5 years post arthroplasty [19; 20]. 
The current study also benefited from direct verification of opioid use and dose with the 
patient. There are several limitations to note. First, we did not assess the specific pain 
condition for which opioids were being used in the patients already prescribed opioids prior 
to surgery and at follow up assessments. Although we are not aware of any studies that have 
assessed this, our results suggest that understanding why patients are using their opioids 
prior to a surgery is important. Additionally, we did not assess affect at the 1- and 3-month 
postoperative time points which limits our ability to understand how change in affect 
impacts opioid cessation. Lastly, these data originated from a tertiary care pain clinic in the 
Midwest, so these results may not be generalizable to other patient settings.
4.6 Conclusions and future directions
Many patients who already take opioids before undergoing a TKA or THA will persist in 
their opioid use following surgery. Moreover, a portion of opioid naïve patients will become 
chronic opioid users after arthroplasty, which has implications well beyond the postoperative 
recovery period. Importantly, we did not find an association between persistent opioid use 
and persistent pain in the knee/hip suggesting other factors likely influence long-term opioid 
use following a successful surgical intervention. We hypothesize that the reasons patients 
continue to use opioids may be due to pain in other areas, self-medicating affective distress

 and therapeutic opioid dependence. In order to identify those at higher risk for persistent 
use, well-designed prospective studies that assess reasons for opioid use are needed in order 
to enhance pre and postoperative pain management. A long-term goal includes the 
development of interventions to aid physicians and patients with opioid cessation following 
surgical interventions such as TKA and THA.

 Figure 1. 
Plot of predicted probability of opioid use at 6 months from daily opioid dose (OME) values 
prior to surgery.
A logistic regression model predicting opioid use from daily opioid dose in oral morphine 
equivalent (OME) values prior to surgery was conducted. A 1-unit increase in OME is 
associated with a 7% increased odds of being on opioids at 6 months. This plot shows the 
increase in predicted probabilities of opioid use at 6 months by pre-surgical OME. OME 
values of 50 or greater are associated with predicted probabilities of 60% or greater of being 
on opioids at 6 months. OME values of 60 or greater are associated with predicted 
probabilities of 80% or greater of being on opioids at 6 months.
