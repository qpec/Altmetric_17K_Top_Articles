Background
Several clinical trials of vitamin D to prevent asthma exacerbation and improve asthma control have been conducted in children and
adults, but a meta-analysis restricted to double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of this intervention is lacking.
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy of administration of vitamin D and its hydroxylated metabolites in reducing the risk of severe asthma exacer-
bations (defined as those requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids) and improving asthma symptom control.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trial Register and reference lists of articles. We contacted the authors of studies in order to
identify additional trials. Date of last search: January 2016.
Selection criteria
Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of vitamin D in children and adults with asthma evaluating exacerbation risk or
asthma symptom control or both.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently applied study inclusion criteria, extracted the data, and assessed risk of bias. We obtained missing
data from the authors where possible. We reported results with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Vitamin D for the management of asthma (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Main results
We included seven trials involving a total of 435 children and two trials involving a total of 658 adults in the primary analysis. Of these,
one trial involving 22 children and two trials involving 658 adults contributed to the analysis of the rate of exacerbations requiring
systemic corticosteroids. Duration of trials ranged from four to 12 months, and the majority of participants had mild to moderate
asthma. Administration of vitamin D reduced the rate of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids (rate ratio 0.63, 95% CI
0.45 to 0.88; 680 participants; 3 studies; high-quality evidence), and decreased the risk of having at least one exacerbation requiring
an emergency department visit or hospitalisation or both (odds ratio (OR) 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.78; number needed to treat for
an additional beneficial outcome, 27; 963 participants; 7 studies; high-quality evidence). There was no effect of vitamin D on %
predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (mean difference (MD) 0.48, 95% CI -0.93 to 1.89; 387 participants; 4 studies;
high-quality evidence) or Asthma Control Test scores (MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.70 to 0.54; 713 participants; 3 studies; high-quality
evidence). Administration of vitamin D did not influence the risk of serious adverse events (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.89; 879
participants; 5 studies; moderate-quality evidence). One trial comparing low-dose versus high-dose vitamin D reported two episodes of
hypercalciuria, one in each study arm. No other study reported any adverse event potentially attributable to administration of vitamin
D. No participant in any included trial suffered a fatal asthma exacerbation. We did not perform a subgroup analysis to determine
whether the effect of vitamin D on risk of severe exacerbation was modified by baseline vitamin D status, due to unavailability of
suitably disaggregated data. We assessed two trials as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain; neither trial contributed data to
the analysis of the outcomes reported above.
Authors’ conclusions
Meta-analysis of a modest number of trials in people with predominantly mild to moderate asthma suggests that vitamin D is likely to
reduce both the risk of severe asthma exacerbation and healthcare use. It is as yet unclear whether these effects are confined to people
with lower baseline vitamin D status; further research, including individual patient data meta-analysis of existing datasets, is needed to
clarify this issue. Children and people with frequent severe asthma exacerbations were under-represented; additional primary trials are
needed to establish whether vitamin D can reduce the risk of severe asthma exacerbation in these groups.

Vitamin D to prevent asthma attacks
Review question
Does vitamin D prevent asthma attacks or improve control of asthma symptoms or both?
Background
Low blood levels of vitamin D (the ’sunshine vitamin’) have been linked to an increased risk of asthma attacks in children and adults
with asthma. Several clinical trials have been conducted to test whether vitamin D might prevent asthma attacks and improve control
of asthma symptoms in children and adults, but results from studies with the most scientifically sound designs have not previously been
evaluated as a group.
Included studies
We included seven trials involving 435 children and two trials involving 658 adults in the review from searches run up to January 2016.
Of these, one trial involving 22 children and two trials involving 658 adults contributed to the analysis of the rate of severe asthma
attacks. Study duration ranged from four to 12 months, and the majority of those taking part had mild or moderate asthma. All of the
studies compared vitamin D with placebo.
Key results
People given vitamin D experienced fewer asthma attacks needing treatment with oral steroids. The average number of attacks per
person per year went down from 0.44 to 0.28 with vitamin D (high-quality evidence). Vitamin D reduced the risk of attending hospital
with an acute asthma attack from 6 per 100 to around 3 per 100 (high-quality evidence).
Vitamin D had little or no effect on lung function or day-to-day asthma symptoms (high-quality evidence). We found that vitamin D
did not increase the risk of serious adverse events at the doses that were tested (moderate-quality evidence).
We based all of these findings on studies judged to be of high quality.

 Conclusion
Vitamin D is likely to offer protection against severe asthma attacks. Further trials focusing on children and people who experience
frequent severe asthma attacks are needed before definitive clinical recommendations can be made.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect
Moderate quality: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is
substantially different
Low quality: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect
1The event rate in participants randomised to placebo was estimated by calculating the weighted mean of event rates reported
in placebo arms of included studies.
2Despite null effects of the intervention on these outcomes, we are confident that the true effect lies close to the estimates,
as 95% confidence intervals for these estimates are very narrow.
3Downgraded two levels due to imprecision (no events occurred in included studies).

Vitamin D for the management of asthma (Review)

Description of the condition
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition of the airways, char-
acterised by recurrent attacks of breathlessness, wheezing, cough,
and chest tightness, commonly termed ’exacerbations’. The preva-
lence of asthma varies widely between countries. In children, the
prevalence of severe asthma symptoms ranges from 0% (India) to
20.3% (Costa Rica) (Lai 2009); in adults, the prevalence of doctor-
diagnosed asthma ranges from 0.2% (China) to 21.0% (Australia)
(To 2012). Exacerbations represent the major cause of morbidity
and mortality in people with asthma (Johnston 2006). Asthma
exacerbations are commonly classified as severe when they require
treatment with systemic corticosteroids and/or when they result
in emergency department attendance, hospitalisation, or death
(Reddel 2009). Common precipitants of asthma exacerbation in-
clude acute respiratory infections and exposure to allergens and
particulates (Singh 2006).
Description of the intervention
Vitamin D is a fat-soluble micronutrient that has two ’parent’
forms: cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and ergocalciferol (vitamin
D2). Cholecalciferol is synthesised in human skin from its pre-
cursor molecule 7-dehydrocholesterol on exposure to ultraviolet B
(UVB) radiation in sunlight; it may also be ingested, either in the
diet (primarily from eating oily fish or vitamin D-fortified foods)
or as vitamin D supplements. Ergocalciferol is the plant and fungal
form of the vitamin, which may be ingested in the diet (primarily
by eating fungi) or as vitamin D supplements. In situations where
cutaneous exposure to UVB radiation of appropriate intensity is
limited (for example during winter at latitudes above 34ºN or
below 34ºS, or in settings where people do not regularly expose
their skin to sunlight), dietary sources of vitamin D or vitamin D
supplements or both may be required to meet the body’s vitamin
D requirement (Holick 2007).
Following cutaneous synthesis or ingestion, both forms of parent
vitamin D undergo metabolism to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D
(25(OH)D), the major circulating vitamin D metabolite whose
serum concentration indicates vitamin D status. 25-hydroxylation
may occur in the liver and in extra-hepatic tissues, including leu-
cocytes (Holick 2007). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations less than
50 nmol/L are widely accepted to indicate vitamin D deficiency;
concentrations less than 25 nmol/L represent profound deficiency.
Concentrations of 50 to 74 nmol/L may represent a milder state
of inadequate vitamin D status, commonly termed ‘vitamin D
insufficiency’. 25(OH)D undergoes a second hydroxylation step
at the 1-alpha position to form the active vitamin D metabolite
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), the steroid hormone
and active vitamin D metabolite that mediates the biological ac-
tions of vitamin D by binding the vitamin D receptor to regulate
gene expression (Holick 2007). This 1-alpha hydroxylation step is
catalysed by the enzyme CYP27B1, which is expressed in many tis-
sues including the kidney, leucocytes, and pulmonary epithelium;
expression of CYP27B1 in leucocytes and pulmonary epithelium
is up-regulated in response to infection and inflammation.
This review included studies evaluating the effects of adminis-
tration, by any route and at any dose, of vitamin D3, vitamin
D2, 25(OH)D, or 1,25(OH)2D. Vitamin D3, vitamin D2, and
25(OH)D are usually administered orally; the ‘parent compounds’
vitamin D3 and vitamin D2 may also be given intramuscularly.
Intramuscular administration of a bolus dose of vitamin D in-
duces a slower increase and a lower peak in serum 25(OH)D than
oral administration of the same dose (Romagnoli 2008), conse-
quently this route of administration is not widely employed in
clinical trials of vitamin D. The functional in vivo half-life of
25(OH)D in the circulation is one to two months; accordingly,
it takes at least three months to attain steady-state concentrations
of 25(OH)D in response to daily administration of vitamin D
(Heaney 2003). Due to the relatively long half-life of 25(OH)D,
parent vitamin D and 25(OH)D may be administered intermit-
tently as well as daily; weekly and monthly dosing regimens are
often employed, and more widely spaced dosing regimens are also
sometimes used. However, dosing less frequently than monthly
results in large non-physiological fluctuations in serum 25(OH)D
concentration, which may cause undesirable effects (Hollis 2013;
Martineau 2012; Vieth 2009). The influence of dosing interval
on biological responses to administration of vitamin D is an area
of active research in the field.
How the intervention might work
About 1 billion people worldwide are estimated to have 25(OH)D
levels of less than 75 nmol/L (Holick 2007). Inadequate vitamin D
status has been reported to be common among people with asthma
in a variety of settings. Cross-sectional, Brehm 2012, and co-
hort, Brehm2010 and Confino-Cohen 2014, studies have demon-
strated independent associations between inadequate vitamin D
status and increased risk of exacerbations. Administration of vita-
min D3, vitamin D2, or 25(OH)D results in increased circulating
concentrations of 25(OH)D. This 25(OH)D acts as a substrate
for CYP27B1 expressed in the kidney and multiple extra-renal tis-
sues. Of particular relevance for asthma, CYP27B1 expression in
the airway and leucocytes is induced during infection and inflam-
mation, so that the active vitamin D metabolite 1,25(OH)2D is
synthesised locally in the lung. 1,25(OH)2D ligates the vitamin
D receptor (VDR) to induce antimicrobial activity (for example
by induction of antimicrobial peptide expression), Greiller 2015
and Martineau 2007, and exert anti-inflammatory activity (for
example by induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10,
suppression of proinflammatory tumour necrosis factor and inter-

 feron-γ - inducible chemokines, and inhibition of lipopolysaccha-
ride-induced synthesis of reactive oxygen species) (Coussens 2012;
Lan 2014; Mann 2014). This combination of antimicrobial, an-
tiviral, and anti-inflammatory activity might decrease the risk of
exacerbations, which are often precipitated by respiratory infec-
tion and which are characterised by dysregulated pulmonary in-
flammation. Of particular relevance to asthma, 1,25(OH)2D has
been shown to inhibit TH17 cytokine production and enhance
responsiveness to inhaled corticosteroids for production of inter-
leukin-10 ex vivo in people with asthma (Nanzer 2014; Xystrakis
2006). These findings raise the possibility that administration of
vitamin D or 25(OH)D may therefore have a role in reducing ex-
acerbation risk and improving symptom control in combination
with inhaled corticosteroids, as well as independently. However,
controversy exists regarding what serum 25(OH)D concentration,
if any, is optimum for reducing the risk of asthma exacerbations.
Why it is important to do this review
There is considerable interest in the potential of administration of
vitamin D to reduce exacerbation risk and improve asthma symp-
tom control. Several published trials of vitamin D in children with
asthma have reported statistically significant reductions in exacer-
bation rates among children randomised to the intervention arm
(Majak 2011; Urashima 2010; Yadav 2014), two trials in adults
have also reported non-statistically significant trends towards re-
duced exacerbation rates in their intervention arms (Castro 2014;
Martineau 2015). Meta-analysis of these trials has the potential to
increase statistical power to detect effects of administering vitamin
D on exacerbation risk. However, definitions of severe exacerba-
tion differ between trials, and published meta-analyses in the field
have utilised the variable definitions reported in primary publica-
tions rather than adopting a unified definition for this outcome
across studies (Luo 2015; Riverin 2015; Xiao 2015). These meta-
analyses also included some non-placebo-controlled trials (Baris
2014; Darabi 2013), as well as trials of relatively short duration
(less than 12 weeks) (De Groot 2015; Schou 2003). We there-
fore conducted a meta-analysis that was restricted to double-blind,
placebo-controlled trials of at least 12 weeks’ duration to deter-
mine the effect of vitamin D on the primary outcome of exacer-
bation treated with systemic corticosteroids.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We reviewed double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials
of at least 12 weeks’ duration. We did not include studies focusing
only on bone outcomes, which we considered to provide very lim-
ited insights into asthma morbidity. We included studies reported
as full text and unpublished data. Where eligible studies were pub-
lished as abstracts only, we contacted the authors to request the full
text of the trial report; where full text was unavailable, we listed
such studies as ’ongoing’.
Types of participants
We included children and adults with a clinical diagnosis of
asthma, based on the presence of characteristic symptoms and
signs (wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, or cough) and
variable airflow obstruction. We imposed no restrictions regarding
disease severity, baseline vitamin D status, or duration of treat-
ment with asthma medication.
Types of interventions
The review was open to studies in which vitamin D3, vitamin D2,
25(OH)D, or 1,25(OH)2D was administered at any dose.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
1. Incidence of severe asthma exacerbations, defined as those
requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids
Secondary outcomes
1. Incidence of asthma exacerbations precipitating an
emergency department visit or requiring hospital admission or
both
2. End-study Asthma Control Test (ACT) score
3. End-study % predicted forced expiratory volume in one
second (FEV1)
4. Incidence of any severe adverse event, irrespective of
causation
5. Incidence of fatal asthma exacerbation
6. Incidence of asthma exacerbation as defined in the study
protocol
7. End-study % eosinophils in induced sputum or
bronchoalveolar lavage
8. End-study peak expiratory flow rate

 9. Incidence of adverse reactions attributed to administration
of vitamin D or its metabolites
10. Proportion of participants withdrawing from the trial
We would have meta-analysed the following secondary outcomes
had sufficient data been available.
1. Time off school or work due to asthma symptoms
2. Beta2-agonist inhaler use
3. End-study asthma quality of life as judged by use of a
validated instrument
4. End-study fractional exhaled nitric oxide concentration
5. End-study airway reactivity
6. Costs from the perspective of healthcare providers
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group’s Spe-
cialised Register (CAGR), which is maintained by the informa-
tion specialist for the Group. The Register contains trial reports
identified through systematic searches of bibliographic databases
including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, and
PsycINFO, and handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting
abstracts (please see Appendix 1 for further details). We searched
all records in the CAGR using the search strategy in Appendix 2.
We
also
conducted
searches
of ClinicalTrials.gov (www.ClinicalTrials.gov), the World Health
Organization trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/), the ISRCTN
registry (www.isrctn.com/), the Australian New Zealand Clinical
Trials Registry (www.anzctr.org.au/), and the UMIN Clinical Tri-
alsRegistry(www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/). We searchedall databasesfrom
their inception to 6 January 2016, and imposed no restriction on
language of publication.
Searching other resources
We checked reference lists of all primary studies and review arti-
cles for additional references. We searched relevant manufacturers’
websites for trial information.
We searched for errata or retractions from included studies pub-
lished in full text on PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed),
but did not find any. We also contacted a panel of international
experts for additional references and information on trials in
progress.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two people (Adrian R Martineau (ARM) and either Christopher
J Cates (CJC) or Andrea Takeda (AT)) independently screened for
inclusion the titles and abstracts of all the potentially relevant stud-
ies identified as a result of the search, coding them as ’retrieve’ (el-
igible or potentially eligible/unclear) or ’do not retrieve’. We then
retrieved the full-text study reports/publication, and two people
(ARM and either CJC or AT) independently screened the full text,
identifying studies for inclusion and identifying and recording
reasons for exclusion of the ineligible studies. Any disagreements
were resolved through discussion or by consultation with other
members of the review team (Christopher J Griffiths (CJG) and
Aziz Sheikh (AS)) or both. We identified and excluded duplicates
and collated multiple reports of the same study so that each study,
rather than each report, was the unit of interest in the review. We
recorded the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a
PRISMA flow diagram and ’Characteristics of excluded studies’
table (Moher 2009).
Data extraction and management
We used a data collection form for study characteristics and out-
come data which was piloted on at least one study in the review.
Two review authors (ARM and one of CJC, CJG, and Alex P Grif-
fiths (APG)) extracted study characteristics from each included
study. We extracted the following study characteristics.
1. Methods: study design, total duration of study, details of
any ’run-in’ period, number of study centres and location, study
setting, withdrawals, and date of study.
2. Participants: number, mean age, age range, gender, body
mass index, severity of condition, diagnostic criteria, baseline
lung function, smoking history, inclusion criteria, and exclusion
criteria.
3. Interventions: intervention, comparison, concomitant
medications, and excluded medications.
4. Outcomes: primary and secondary outcomes specified and
collected, and time points reported.
5. Notes: funding for trial, and notable conflicts of interest of
trial authors.
Two review authors (ARM and one of CJC, CJG, and APG) in-
dependently extracted outcome data from each included study. If
outcome data were not reported in a usable way, we noted this
in the ’Characteristics of included studies’ table. We resolved dis-
agreements by consensus or by involving a third person (CJG or
AS). One review author (ARM) transferred data into the RevMan
2015 file. We double-checked that data were entered correctly by
comparing the data presented in the systematic review with the
study reports. A second review author (CJC) checked study char-
acteristics for accuracy against the trial reports.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
The ’Risk of bias’ assessment for the study authored by ARM
and CJG, Martineau 2015, was performed by Ulugbek Nurmatov

 (UN) and CJC. For all other studies, two review authors (ARM
and one of CJC and APG) independently assessed the risk of bias
for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). We resolved
any disagreements by discussion or by involving another review
author (AS). We assessed the risk of bias according to the following
domains.
1. Random sequence generation
2. Allocation concealment
3. Blinding of participants and personnel
4. Blinding of outcome assessment
5. Incomplete outcome data
6. Selective outcome reporting
7. Other biases, including study size
We graded each potential source of bias as high, low, or unclear and
provided a quote from the study report together with a justification
for our judgement in the ’Risk of bias’ table. We summarised
the ’Risk of bias’ judgements across different studies for each of
the domains listed. Where information on risk of bias related to
unpublished data or correspondence with a trialist, we noted this
in the ’Risk of bias’ table. When considering treatment effects, we
took into account the risk of bias for the studies that contributed
to that outcome.
Assessment of bias in conducting the systematic
review
We conducted the review according to a published protocol
(Martineau 2015b), and have reported any deviations from it in
the Differences between protocol and review section.
Measures of treatment effect
We analysed event rates as rate ratios (RR), dichotomous data as
odds ratios (OR), and times to first event as hazard ratios (HR). We
analysed other continuous outcome measures as mean difference
(MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD). We used generic
inverse variance meta-analysis where adjusted measures of treat-
ment effect from individual trials were included. We entered data
presented as a scale with a consistent direction of effect. For anal-
yses of outcomes in which no events occurred in some studies, we
also calculated risk differences (RD). We undertook meta-analyses
only where this was meaningful, that is if the treatments, partic-
ipants, and the underlying clinical question were similar enough
for pooling to make sense.
Where multiple trial arms were reported in a single trial, we in-
cluded only the relevant arms. If two comparisons (for example
drug A versus placebo and drug B versus placebo) had been com-
bined in the same meta-analysis, we would have halved the control
group to avoid double-counting.
For outcomes measured at different time points, we included the
longest time point after randomisation.
Unit of analysis issues
If data had been expressed in unconventional units of analysis, we
would have converted them to conventional units, liaising with
the authors where required.
Dealing with missing data
We contacted investigators or study sponsors in order to verify
key study characteristics and to obtain missing numerical out-
come data where possible. We asked all investigators to provide
data relating to the incidence of fatal asthma exacerbations and
exacerbations requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids or
emergency department attendance/hospitalisation or both where
these were not reported in the manuscript or abstract.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We used the I2 statistic to measure heterogeneity among the trials
in each analysis. Where we identified substantial heterogeneity (I
2 greater than 40%), we assessed the value of exploring possible
causes by using a prespecified subgroup analysis. However, limita-
tions of the available data (for example where data for participants
within different subgroups could not be disaggregated, or where
numbers of participants or events or both within a subgroup were
small) precluded the conduct of such subgroup analyses.
Assessment of reporting biases
Had we been able to pool more than 10 trials, we would have
created and examined a funnel plot to explore possible small-study
biases.
Data synthesis
Given significant heterogeneity between studies, we used a ran-
dom-effects model for the primary analysis. We performed sensi-
tivity analyses using fixed-effect models for outcomes where the
two models yielded different results. We analysed all data by
intention-to-treat. We synthesised event rates as RRs, dichoto-
mous data as ORs, and times to first event as HRs. We syn-
thesised other continuous outcome measures as MD or SMD.
We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional ben-
eficial outcome (NNTB) using the Visual Rx NNT calculator
(www.nntonline.net/visualrx/) where meta-analysis of dichoto-
mous outcomes revealed a statistically significant beneficial ef-
fect of allocation to vitamin D. We would have similarly calcu-
lated the number needed to treat for an additional harmful out-
come (NNTH) if meta-analysis of dichotomous outcomes had
revealed statistically significant harmful effects of vitamin D. We
used means and standard deviations (SDs) when available. Where
data were not reported we approached the study authors. We
would have extracted values from graphs had study authors not
responded.

 ’Summary of findings’ table
We created a ’Summary of findings’ table using the following out-
comes: incidence of asthma exacerbation treated with systemic
corticosteroids; incidence of asthma exacerbation requiring emer-
gency department attendance or hospitalisation for asthma or
both; end-study % predicted FEV1; end-study ACT score; inci-
dence of fatal asthma exacerbation; and incidence of serious ad-
verse events due to any cause. We used the five GRADE consider-
ations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indi-
rectness, and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of
evidence as it related to the studies which contributed data to the
meta-analyses for the prespecified outcomes. Where data from pri-
mary studies conducted by review authors contributed to a given
outcome, the quality of the evidence was assessed by review au-
thors who were not involved with those primary studies (CJC and
AS). We used methods and recommendations described in Sec-
tion 8.5 and Chapter 12 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions, Higgins 2011, using GRADEpro GDT
2014 software. We justified all decisions to down- or upgrade the
quality of studies using footnotes where necessary.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We prespecified that we would carry out the following subgroup
analyses for the outcome of exacerbation treated with systemic
corticosteroids (Martineau 2015b).
1. Baseline vitamin D status (e.g. serum 25(OH)D < 50
nmol/L versus ≥ 50 nmol/L).
2. Age (e.g. children aged < 5 years versus 5 to 16 years versus
adults).
3. Severity of asthma and concomitant asthma treatment
being taken (e.g. taking versus not taking inhaled corticosteroids,
taking versus not taking leukotriene receptor antagonists).
4. The dose (e.g. daily equivalent of < 400 IU versus 400 to
2000 IU versus > 2000 IU) and form of vitamin D administered
(e.g. cholecalciferol versus calcitriol).
5. The frequency of administration (e.g. daily versus
intermittent bolus doses).
6. Genetic variation in pathways of vitamin D metabolism,
transport, and signalling (e.g. GC 2/2 versus 2/1 versus 1/1
genotype for the GC polymorphism of the vitamin D binding
protein).
7. Body mass index (e.g. < 25 kg/m2 versus ≥ 25 kg/m2).
However, limitations of the available data (for example where data
for participants within different subgroups could not be disaggre-
gated, or where numbers of participants or events or both within
a subgroup were small) precluded the conduct of such subgroup
analyses.
Had we conducted these subgroup analyses, we would have used
the formal test for subgroup interactions in RevMan 2015.
Sensitivity analysis
We carried out the following sensitivity analyses.
1. Exclusion of publications assessed as being at high risk of
bias in one or more of the following domains: sequence
generation, allocation concealment, blinding, completeness of
outcome data, or selective outcome reporting.
2. Analyses using fixed-effect models were performed for
outcomes where such models yielded results different from those
generated by random-effects models (Table 1).

 We identified a total of 105 references to 78 different studies by
searching the CAGR and an additional three studies by search-
ing clinical trial registries. After removing one duplicate reference,
we screened 107 references to 81 different studies for eligibility.
We excluded 62 studies on the basis of the titles or the abstracts
or both of the associated references. We assessed the remaining
19 studies for eligibility by consulting the full text of associated
references or contacting study authors or both; we then excluded
10 more studies, four of which did not meet eligibility criteria
for inclusion and six of which we classified as ongoing. We have
presented the reasons for excluding potentially relevant studies in
the Characteristics of excluded studies table.
Included studies
See Characteristics of included studies for full details. Nine com-
pleted studies including a total of 1093 participants with asthma
met the inclusion criteria for this review (Castro 2014; Jensen
2016; Lewis 2012; Majak 2009; Majak 2011; Martineau 2015;
Tachimoto 2016; Urashima 2010; Yadav 2014).
Study design
All included studies were double-blind randomised controlled tri-
als with a parallel-group design, open to male and female partic-
ipants of any ethnic background; five were conducted at a sin-
gle centre (Jensen 2016; Lewis 2012; Majak 2009; Majak 2011;
Yadav 2014), and four were multicentre studies (Castro 2014;
Martineau 2015; Tachimoto 2016; Urashima 2010). All studies
recruited in secondary care, and one study also recruited in pri-
mary care (Martineau 2015). Study duration ranged from four
months, in Urashima 2010, to 12 months, in Lewis 2012, Majak
2009, and Martineau 2015. All trials were restricted to individuals
with a physician diagnosis of asthma; two trials additionally based
eligibility on evidence of reversible or variable airway obstruction
(Castro 2014; Martineau 2015). Current treatment with inhaled
corticosteroids was a requirement for three trials (Castro 2014;
Majak 2009; Martineau 2015), and an exclusion criterion for one
trial (Majak 2011); one trial excluded participants who had re-
ceived oral corticosteroid therapy in the year prior to enrolment
(Urashima 2010). All of the remaining trials included at least some
participants who were taking inhaled corticosteroids.
Only one trial included baseline vitamin D status as an eligibil-
ity criterion (Castro 2014, which excluded people with baseline
25(OH)D concentration greater than or equal to 75 nmol/L), but
six trials had exclusion criteria relating to maximum permitted
pre-trial or concomitant supplemental vitamin D intake or both
(Castro 2014; Jensen 2016; Majak 2009; Majak 2011; Martineau
2015; Tachimoto 2016).
Participants
Seven studies involved 435 children (Jensen 2016; Lewis 2012;
Majak 2009; Majak 2011; Tachimoto 2016; Urashima 2010;
Yadav 2014), and two studies involved 658 adults (Castro 2014;
Martineau 2015). Participants were ethnically diverse, reflecting
the broad range of geographic settings: Canada (Jensen 2016),
India (Yadav 2014), Japan (Tachimoto 2016; Urashima 2010),
Poland(Majak 2009; Majak 2011), the UK (Martineau2015), and
the USA (Castro 2014; Lewis 2012). The majority of participants
had mild/moderate asthma, and a minority had severe asthma.
Where measured, mean/median baseline serum 25(OH)D con-
centration ranged from 48 nmol/L, in Castro 2014, to 89 nmol/
L, in Majak 2011; a small minority of participants had serum
25(OH)D concentrations in the profoundly deficient range (less
than 25 nmol/L).
Intervention
All studies administered oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) to par-
ticipants in the intervention arm. There was considerable hetero-
geneity in vitamin D dosage regimens employed. Four studies,
Lewis 2012, Majak 2011, Tachimoto 2016, and Urashima 2010,
used exclusively daily dosing regimens ranging from 500 IU/day,
in Majak 2011, to 1200 IU/day, in Urashima 2010. Of the other
studies, one used weekly dosing (Majak 2009), one used monthly
dosing (Yadav 2014), one used two-monthly dosing (Martineau
2015), and two gave a bolus dose at the start of the study, followed
by daily dosing (Castro 2014; Jensen 2016). One study admin-
istered low-dose vitamin D (400 IU/day) to participants in both
the control arm and intervention arm; participants in the inter-
vention arm of this study received an additional bolus of 100,000
IU vitamin D at the start of the study (Jensen 2016). For the
six trials in which vitamin D was given daily (with or without
additional bolus doses) (Castro 2014; Jensen 2016; Lewis 2012;
Majak 2011; Tachimoto 2016; Urashima 2010), the median daily
dose was 900 IU/day, ranging from 400 IU/day, in Jensen 2016,
to 4000 IU/day, in Castro 2014. Where vitamin D status was as-
sessed, the intervention resulted in an interarm difference in fol-
low-up serum 25(OH)D concentration on at least one follow-up
time point in four studies (Castro 2014; Jensen 2016; Martineau
2015; Tachimoto 2016), but not in three others (Lewis 2012;
Majak 2009; Majak 2011).
Outcomes
Seven trials reported asthma exacerbation as an outcome mea-
sure (Castro 2014; Jensen 2016; Majak 2011; Martineau 2015;
Tachimoto 2016; Urashima 2010; Yadav 2014). Definitions of
exacerbation varied significantly between trials. Authors of seven

2014; Jensen 2016; Majak 2009; Majak 2011; Martineau 2015;

 Allocation
Two studies did not report the method of sequence generation
(Lewis 2012; Yadav 2014), and two studies did not report the
method of allocation concealment (Lewis 2012; Majak 2011). We
have therefore classified the risk of selection bias for these studies
as ’unclear’. We assessed the risk of selection bias for the remaining
studies as low.
Blinding
It appears that participants and study personnel, including those
who administered the intervention, have been effectively blinded
to allocation for all studies; accordingly, we assessed the risk of
performance and detection bias as low for all studies.
Incomplete outcome data
One-third of participants in the study by Lewis et al were lost
to follow-up (Lewis 2012); we have therefore assessed the risk of
attrition bias as high for this study. The study by Yadav et al reports
that 18 out of 100 participants were lost to follow-up, but follow-
up data for 100 participants was presented for the final follow-
up visit (Yadav 2014). This discrepancy led us to assess the risk of
attrition bias as being high for this study. We assessed the study by
Urashima et al as being at unclear risk of attrition bias (Urashima
2010); although rates of loss were comparable between arms for
this trial as a whole (50 out of 217 intervention arm, 46 out of
213 control arm), they were not reported for the subgroup of
participants with doctor-diagnosed asthma. We assessed the risk
of attrition bias for the remaining studies as low.
Selective reporting
We found no evidence of selective reporting for any of the included
studies, and have therefore assessed the risk of reporting bias as
low for all studies.
Other potential sources of bias
In the study by Yadav et al (Yadav 2014), we noted a marked
change in classification of asthma severity between the six-month
time point and earlier time points. This suggested a high risk of
misclassification bias operating at the final follow-up time point.
We identified no other potential sources of bias for the remaining
included trials.

See Summary of findings for the main comparison.
Vitamin D versus placebo: all eligible trials
Nine trials with a total of 1093 participants (435 children and 658
adults) contributed to this comparison for at least one outcome.
Three trials with a total of 680 participants (22 children and 658
adults) contributed to this comparison for analysis of the rate of
exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids.
Primary outcome
Asthma exacerbation treated with systemic corticosteroids
Analyses including all participants
Administration of vitamin D was associated with a statistically sig-
nificant reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbations treated with
systemic corticosteroids (RR 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI)
0.45 to 0.88; 680 participants; 3 studies; high-quality evidence;
Analysis 1.1; Figure 3). We found weaker evidence to suggest a
benefit of vitamin D for the outcomes of time to first such ex-
acerbation (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.00; 658 participants; 2
studies; moderate-quality evidence; Analysis 1.2) and proportion
of participants experiencing one or more such exacerbation (OR
0.74, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.10; 933 participants; 7 studies; moder-
ate-quality evidence; Analysis 1.3); 95% confidence intervals in-
cluded or spanned 1.00 for these outcomes. Of note, trials con-
ducted in adults contributed a disproportionate amount of data
to these analyses (Castro 2014; Martineau 2015); severe exacer-
bations were only seen in two out of five trials that enrolled chil-
dren (Jensen 2016; Tachimoto 2016), and the total numbers of
such events were small. Also of note, only one child in the trial
by Tachimoto et al experienced such an event (Tachimoto 2016),
therefore RRs and HRs for this study could not be calculated.
Time-to-event data for calculation of HRs were not available for
the other paediatric trial that saw any such events (Jensen 2016).

Subgroup analyses
Lack of access to individual participant data precluded conduct of
prespecified subgroup analyses for the outcome of severe asthma
exacerbation according to baseline vitamin D status, asthma sever-
ity, concomitant asthma treatment, body mass index, and genetic
variation in the vitamin D pathway.
We did not conduct prespecified subgroup analyses for different
age groups (children aged less than 5 years versus 5 to 16 years
versus adults) due to a lack of severe exacerbations arising in trials
that enrolled children. We did not conduct subgroup analyses for
different dosing frequencies as some studies combined bolus and
daily dosing strategies and could not be classified (Castro 2014;
Jensen 2016), and the number of remaining studies within each
subcategory was small. We did not perform subgroup analyses for
different dose sizes due to the small number of studies and events
arising within each subcategory.
All trials investigated effects of vitamin D3, which precluded the
conduct of subgroup analysis by type of vitamin D administered.
Secondary outcomes
Asthma exacerbation precipitating emergency department
visit or requiring hospitalisation or both
Administration of vitamin D was associated with a statistically sig-
nificant reduction in the proportion of participants experiencing
an asthma exacerbation precipitating an emergency department
visit or hospital admission or both (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to
0.78; NNTB 27, 95% CI 20 to 76; 963 participants; 7 studies;
high-quality evidence; Analysis 1.5; Figure 4). The expected result
in 100 people given vitamin D for an average of 7 months is shown
in the Cates plot in Figure 5: in comparison with 6 out of 100
with this outcome on placebo, this fell to 3 out of 100 (95% CI 1
to 5) on vitamin D.

 Figure 5.
In the control group 6 out of 100 people had a visit to ED or hospitalisation over 8 months,
compared to 3 (95% CI 1 to 5) out of 100 on vitamin D.
As only two of the trials conducted in children reported any such
events (Jensen 2016; Tachimoto 2016), results of this analysis were
primarily driven by the findings of the two trials conducted in
adults (Castro 2014; Martineau 2015).
ACT scores
We saw no effect of vitamin D on ACT scores (MD -0.08, 95% CI
-0.70 to 0.54; 713 participants; 3 studies; high-quality evidence;
Analysis 1.6).
FEV1, % predicted
There was no overall effect of vitamin D on % predicted FEV1
(MD 0.48, 95% CI -0.93 to 1.89; 387 participants; 4 studies;
high-quality evidence; Analysis 1.8). We did not include data from
one trial that investigated FEV1 as an outcome measure in this
meta-analysis because absolute values were reported instead of %
predicted values for this study (Castro 2014). Of note, vitamin D
did not influence absolute values of FEV1 in this study (change
in pre-albuterol FEV1 [L] in intervention vs. control arm over the
course of the study: -0.07 [95% CI -0.14 to 0.01] vs. -0.04 [-0.11
to 0.03], P = 0.64).
Serious adverse event, any cause
Administration of vitamin D did not influence the incidence of
serious adverse events of any cause (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.89;
879 participants; 5 studies; I2 = 0%; moderate-quality evidence;
Analysis 1.9)
Fatal asthma exacerbations
No participant in any of the included trials suffered a fatal asthma
exacerbation, therefore we saw no effect of the intervention on
this outcome (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; 963 participants;
7 studies; I2 = 0%; low quality evidence; Analysis 1.7).
Asthma exacerbation as defined in primary trial protocols
17
Vitamin D for the management of asthma (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 The definitions of asthma exacerbations used in individual trials
are summarised in Table 2. Administration of vitamin D reduced
the risk of experiencing at least one such exacerbation (OR 0.53,
95% CI 0.28 to 0.99; NNTB 9, 95% CI 6 to 483; 999 partic-
ipants; 7 studies; moderate-quality evidence; Figure 6; Analysis
1.10), but there was considerable heterogeneity in study defini-
tions of exacerbation, and I2 was high (65%). The expected result
in 100 people given vitamin D for an average of 8 months is shown
in the Cates plot in Figure 7: in comparison with 29 out of 100
with this outcome on placebo, this fell to 18 out of 100 (95% CI
10 to 29) on vitamin D.

 Figure 7.
In the control group 29 out of 100 people had a study-defined exacerbation over 7 months,
compared to 18 (95% CI 10 to 29) out of 100 on Vitamin D.
Lower airway eosinophilia
Vitamin D did not influence mean eosinophil count in the lower
airway (MD -0.38, 95% CI -1.92 to 1.15; 525 participants; 3
studies; high-quality evidence; Analysis 1.11).
Peak expiratory flow rate
Vitamin D did not influence mean end-study peak expiratory
flow rate (MD 3.16, 95% CI -13.40 to 19.72; 302 participants;
2 studies; high-quality evidence; Analysis 1.12).
Adverse reaction to vitamin D
Two participants in one trial experienced hypercalciuria (Jensen
2016), an adverse event that is recognised as an adverse reaction to
vitamin D; this event arose in one participant in the intervention
arm and one participant in the control arm of a study in which low-
dose vitamin D was administered in both arms. No other study
reported episodes of hypercalciuria or any other adverse events
potentially attributable to administration of vitamin D.
Withdrawals
We saw no difference in the proportion of participants withdraw-
ing from trials between intervention and control arms, but the
confidence intervals were wide (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.58;
1093 participants; 9 studies; moderate-quality evidence; Analysis
1.14).
Time off school or work
One trial conducted in adults investigated the outcome of work
absence due to asthma exacerbation or upper respiratory infection
(Martineau 2015). Allocation to vitamin D did not influence such
workabsence whenmeasuredastime tofirstevent(adjustedhazard
ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.10), event rate (adjusted rate ratio
0.86, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.46), or proportion of participants with at
least one such absence (adjusted odds ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.45 to
1.30). No trial conducted in children investigated the outcome of
time off school due to asthma symptoms.

 Use of inhaled beta2-agonists
One trial conducted in adults investigated the effects of vitamin
D on the number of uses of inhaled relief medication per 24 hours
(Martineau 2015). Allocation to vitamin D did not influence this
outcome at 12 months (adjusted ratio of geometric means 1.00,
95% CI 0.77 to 1.28).
Asthma quality of life
Two trials conducted in adults investigated the effects of vitamin
D on respiratory quality of life. Martineau et al reported that ad-
ministration of vitamin D modestly improved respiratory quality
of life as evidenced by adjusted interarm differences in total St
George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score of -3.9 points
at 2 months (P = 0.005), -3.7 points at 6 months (P = 0.038),
and -3.3 points at 12 months (P = 0.060; P for allocation-time
interaction = 0.026). These reductions were associated with sta-
tistically significant decreases in component scores for the impacts
dimension of the SGRQ at two months (P = 0.05) and six months
(P = 0.005; P for allocation-time interaction = 0.030) (Martineau
2015). Of note, the minimum clinically important difference for
this score is around 4 points (Jones 2005). Castro et al reported
no effect of the intervention on the Asthma Bother Profile score:
the adjusted mean change in score was -1.0 (95% CI -2.7 to 0.7)
in the intervention arm versus -2.4 (95% CI -4.0 to -0.7) in the
placebo arm; P = 0.16) (Castro 2014). Data from these two dif-
ferent instruments were unsuitable for pooling and were therefore
not meta-analysed.
Fractional exhaled nitric oxide concentration (FeNO)
One trial conducted in adults investigated the effects of vitamin D
on FeNO. Martineau et al reported that administration of vitamin
D had no effect on mean FeNO concentrations at 12 months
(ratio of geometric means −1.4, 95% CI −6.8 to 3.9) (Martineau
2015).
Other immunological biomarkers of asthma control
One trial conducted in adults investigated the effects of vitamin
D on concentrations of inflammatory markers in induced sputum
supernatants. Martineau et al reported that administration of vi-
tamin D had no effect on supernatant concentrations of a panel of
17 inflammatory markers whose concentrations were detectable,
measured at 2 and 12 months (Martineau 2015). Another trial
conducted in adults investigated the effects of vitamin D on func-
tion of myeloid cells and CD4+ Tcells in peripheral blood, but
found no effect (Castro 2014).
Airway reactivity
One trial conducted in adults investigated the effects of vitamin
D on airway reactivity. Castro et al reported that administration
of vitamin D had no effect on the provocative concentration of
methacholine at which FEV1 decreased by 20% (PC20): the ad-
justed mean change in log base 2 transformed PC20 (doubling
dilutions) was 0.70 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.03) in the intervention arm
versus 0.74 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.07) in the placebo arm; P = 0.87
(Castro 2014).
Costs from the perspective of healthcare providers
One trial conducted in adults investigated the effects of vitamin
D on health economic outcomes. Martineau et al reported that
administration of vitamin D had no effect on total costs associ-
ated with asthma/upper respiratory infection over 12 months (ad-
justed mean difference GBP 66.78, 95% CI GBP -263.47 to GBP
397.03).
Vitamin D versus placebo: sensitivity analysis
excluding trials at high risk of bias
Neither of the two trials assessed as being at high risk of bias con-
tributed data relating to incidence of exacerbation treated with
systemic corticosteroids or exacerbation precipitating emergency
department attendance or hospitalisation or both. One trial as-
sessed as being at high risk of bias reported effects of vitamin D on
the proportion of participants experiencing at least one study-de-
fined exacerbation (Yadav 2014). When this trial was excluded in
a sensitivity analysis, the effect of vitamin D on this outcome was
no longer statistically significant (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.21;
899 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence; Analysis
2.1).
Both trials assessed as being at high risk of bias reported effects of
vitamin D on the proportion of participants withdrawing from the
trial (Lewis 2012; Yadav 2014). When these trials were excluded
in a sensitivity analysis, the effect of vitamin D on this outcome
remained null (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.88; 963 participants;
7 studies; I2 = 7%; moderate-quality evidence; Analysis 2.2).
Vitamin D versus placebo: sensitivity analysis using

Random-effects and fixed-effect models yielded non-identical but
similar results for seven secondary outcomes. Results of analyses

Summary of main results
This systematic review and meta-analysis incorporated evidence

 blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of vitamin D supple-
mentation; of these, one trial involving 22 children and two tri-
als involving 658 adults contributed to the analysis of the rate of
exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. Administration
of vitamin D resulted in a clinically and statistically significant
reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment
with systemic corticosteroids (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.88; 680
participants; 3 studies; high-quality evidence; we define a clini-
cally significant reduction in an adverse outcome as being one that
patients and clinicians consider large enough to justify a change
in treatment). Administration of vitamin D also resulted in a clin-
ically and statistically significant reduction in the risk of asthma
exacerbations resulting in emergency department attendance or
hospitalisation or both (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.78; 963 par-
ticipants; 7 studies; high-quality evidence). Of note, only two of
the trials conducted in children reported any severe exacerbations
(Jensen 2016; Tachimoto 2016), and both of these trials were rel-
atively small (22 and 89 participants, respectively). Accordingly,
results of this analysis were primarily driven by the findings of the
two trials conducted in adults (Castro 2014; Martineau 2015). It
should also be noted that three out of seven studies for which data
on emergency department attendance or hospitalisation or both
were available did not report any such events (Majak 2009; Majak
2011; Urashima 2010).
In contrast to the protective effects demonstrated against severe
exacerbation, we saw no effect of vitamin D on ACT score (MD
-0.08, 95% CI -0.70 to 0.54; 713 participants; 3 studies; high-
quality evidence) or % predicted FEV1 (MD 0.48, 95% CI -
0.93 to 1.89; 387 participants; 4 studies; high-quality evidence).
Vitamin D did not influence the risk of any serious adverse event,
although the 95% confidence interval for this outcome was wide
(OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.89; 879 participants; 5 studies; I2
= 0%; moderate-quality evidence). No fatal asthma exacerbations
were reported in any trial included in this meta-analysis.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
This review incorporated evidence from a relatively modest num-
ber of studies, and results should not be generalised to patient
populations who are not represented. Specifically, there is a relative
lack of evidence on the effects of vitamin D in people with severe
asthma, as evidenced by the modest number of exacerbations re-
sulting in emergency department attendance or hospitalisation or
both, and the absence of fatal exacerbations. This caveat applies
particularly to the studies enrolling children: only 13 of the 305
children included in analysis of the primary outcome experienced
an exacerbation that was treated with systemic corticosteroids, as
compared with 118 of 628 adults. Consequently, the finding that
vitamin D protected against severe asthma exacerbation is based
primarily on results of trials conducted in adults, and therefore
should not be generalised to paediatric populations. Moreover, the
review does not provide evidence about optimum vitamin D doses
and circulating 25(OH)D concentrations.
This review was limited to the inclusion of aggregate data from
published manuscripts, which prevented us from conducting any
of the subgroup analyses prespecified in the study protocol. Con-
sequently we are unable to comment on whether effects of the
intervention are modified by factors such as asthma severity or
baseline vitamin D status. Populations with proven profound vi-
tamin D deficiency (serum 25(OH)D less than 25 nmol/L) were
also poorly represented in the studies eligible for inclusion in this
review; this is particularly significant given that baseline vitamin
D status may modify the effects of administering vitamin D on
exacerbation risk, a phenomenon that has been reported in peo-
ple with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Lehouck 2012;
Martineau 2015a). Conversely, a trend towards increased risk of
exacerbation when vitamin D is given to those with higher baseline
vitamin D status has been reported (Janssens 2013; Martineau
2015a). Further research to clarify whether baseline vitamin D sta-
tus modifies effects of vitamin D on exacerbation risk, including
individual patient data meta-analysis of existing datasets, is needed
before definitive clinical recommendations can be made.
Despite these reservations regarding external validity, there is less
reason to doubt the internal validity of our findings: these are based
on double-blind, placebo-controlled trials assessed as being at low
risk of bias. Moreover, we found effects of vitamin D on risk of
exacerbation to be consistent when this outcome was expressed in
different ways (RR (Analysis 1.1) versus HR (Analysis 1.2) versus
OR (Analysis 1.3)), and when different definitions of exacerba-
tion were used (exacerbations treated with systemic corticosteroids
(Analysis 1.1) versus those defined according to study protocols
(Analysis 1.10)). For outcomes where vitamin D was found not to
have an effect (% predicted FEV1, ACT score), 95% confidence
intervals were narrow (Analysis 1.8; Analysis 1.6), effectively rul-
ing out a clinically important effect in the populations studied.
The contrast between favourable effects of vitamin D on exacer-
bation versus null effects of this intervention on other measures
of asthma control is striking, and it has implications for choice
of outcome measures in future trials. Given that the majority of
asthma exacerbations are precipitated by viral upper respiratory
infections (Johnston 2006), it seems likely that vitamin D’s mech-
anism of action relates either to prevention of such infections, or
to interruption of pathways by which such events trigger exacer-
bations (Greiller 2015).
Quality of the evidence
This review was restricted to double-blind, placebo-controlled tri-
als; consequently, we assessed all included studies as being at low
risk of performance bias and detection bias. We assessed two stud-
ies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain. As neither
of these studies contributed data to the primary outcome of this
meta-analysis, the evidence contributing to analysis of the effects
21
Vitamin D for the management of asthma (Review)

 of vitamin D on risk of severe asthma exacerbation can be regarded
as of high quality. The quality of the evidence relating to adverse
event outcomes was lower. Specifically, evidence regarding fatal
exacerbations was downgraded two levels to ’low’ due to impreci-
sion, as no such events occurred in any included study. Evidence
relating to incidence of serious adverse events was downgraded one
level due to ’moderate’ for imprecision, as confidence intervals for
the pertinent odds ratio were relatively wide (0.54 to 1.89).
Potential biases in the review process
We searched multiple databases for eligible studies using prespec-
ified criteria, and this strategy led to identification of unpub-
lished data which are included in this review. As for any review of
randomised controlled trials, publication bias may have favoured
publication of trials reporting favourable results of vitamin D on
asthma outcomes. The total number of studies included in this
review is relatively modest, and we identified a further six eligi-
ble trials that are ongoing; a repetition of the review in the short
to medium term will determine whether or not promising results
from meta-analysis of early trials are reinforced by subsequent
studies.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
We are aware of three other systematic reviews that have synthe-
sised evidence from randomised controlled trials of vitamin D in
people with asthma.
The study by Riverin et al (Riverin 2015) included data from eight
trials in children, five of which we included in our review (Lewis
2012; Majak 2009; Majak 2011; Urashima 2010; Yadav 2014)
and three of which we excluded either on the grounds that they
were not placebo controlled (Baris 2014; Darabi 2013), or be-
cause duration of follow-up was less than 12 weeks (Schou 2003).
Data from Tachimoto et al (Tachimoto 2016), included in this
meta-analysis, were not included in Riverin 2015. Riverin 2015
reported a reduction in risk of study-defined asthma exacerbation
with vitamin D (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.63; 378 participants;
3 studies), which was deemed of low quality. No effect of the in-
tervention was seen on asthma symptom scores or lung function.
The study by Luo et al included data from seven trials in both
children and adults (Luo 2015), four of which we included in our
review, and three of which we excluded on the grounds that they
did not report asthma control outcomes (Worth 1994), they were
not placebo controlled (Baris 2014), or because duration of follow-
up was less than 12 weeks (De Groot 2015). Luo et al excluded
four studies included in our review (Lewis 2012; Majak 2011;
Tachimoto 2016; Urashima 2010). This meta-analysis reported no
effect of vitamin D on risk of study-defined asthma exacerbation
(RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.37; 820 participants; 3 studies).
The study by Xiao et al focused primarily on effects of vitamin
D on risk of acute respiratory infection (Xiao 2015), but it also
investigated risk of asthma exacerbation in children as a secondary
outcome. This analysis included only two trials (Majak 2011;
Urashima 2010), which reported a protective effect of vitamin D
against “asthma exacerbation triggered by respiratory infection”
(RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.64; 2 studies; n not reported).
The findings of our study seem to be in keeping with those of
Riverin 2015 and Xiao 2015, but contrast with those of Luo 2015.
Disparities in results may be attributable to the inclusion of dif-
ferent primary trials in the different meta-analyses. In addition,
the other meta-analyses used heterogeneous definitions of asthma
exacerbation, as defined by the primary trial, rather than imposing
a universal definition (exacerbation treated with systemic corticos-
teroids), as we did.

Implications for practice
We found a clinically and statistically significant protective effect
of vitamin D against severe exacerbation of asthma and no con-
vincing evidence of an increase in serious adverse events. We be-
lieve that caution is warranted in applying this evidence to clinical
practice because our results come from relatively few trials, none
of which has individually reported a statistically significant effect
of vitamin D on risk of exacerbation requiring treatment with sys-
temic corticosteroids as a prespecified outcome. Trials predomi-
nantly enrolled people with mild or moderate asthma, therefore
those with severe asthma are under-represented. Additionally, tri-
als in children made a relatively minor contribution to findings of
the review relating to severe exacerbations. Consequently, particu-
lar caution should be taken in generalising our findings to people
who have recurrent severe asthma exacerbations and to those aged
less than 16 years.
Furthermore, it is not yet clear whether beneficial effects of admin-
istering vitamin D are experienced by all people with asthma, or
whether this result is driven by favourable effects that are confined
to particular subgroups (for example those with lower baseline vi-
tamin D status, or frequent exacerbations). Studies in chronic ob-
structive pulmonary disease have shown a trend towards increased
risk of exacerbation when vitamin D is given to those with higher
baseline vitamin D status (Janssens 2013; Martineau 2015a). Fur-
ther research to clarify this issue, including individual patient data
meta-analysis of existing datasets, is needed before definitive clin-
ical recommendations can be made.

 significant subgroup effects. Such a project is ongoing (AVID-
Asthma IPDMA), with results expected later in 2016.
We highlight that the optimum vitamin D dose or circulating
25(OH)D level that protects against asthma exacerbations is as yet
unknown and requires additional primary studies to determine.
There is also a need for new primary randomised controlled trials
in populations that are under-represented in the current review,
specifically in vitamin D-deficient children and adults who expe-
rience recurrent severe exacerbations. Eligibility criteria should be
guided by findings of subgroup analyses from individual patient
data meta-analysis, which may reveal groups who are more likely
to experience benefit or harm from the intervention than others.
Our review suggests that such studies are more likely to find effects
of vitamin D on exacerbations requiring treatment with systemic
corticosteroids than on other outcome measures. These studies
should measure participants’ vitamin D status both at baseline and
at follow-up to allow determination of whether effects of admin-
istering vitamin D are dependent on baseline or attained serum
25(OH)D concentrations or both.

Adrian R Martineau (ARM) and Chris J Griffiths (CJG) wrote the protocol; Christopher J Cates (CJC), Aziz Sheikh (AS), and Ulugbek
Nurmatov (UN) commented on it. Mitsuyoshi Urashima (MU) and Megan Jensen (MJ) contributed unpublished data. ARM, Alex P
Griffiths (APG), CJC and UN assessed eligibility of trials for inclusion, extracted data, and performed ’Risk of bias’ assessments. ARM
entered data into Review Manager 5.3 for statistical analysis, which CJC cross-checked. ARM drafted the manuscript, and all review
authors critically evaluated it for important intellectual content and gave final approval of the version to be published.

ARM, MU, MJ, and CJG all acted as investigators in one or more clinical trials contributing data to this review. The ’Risk of bias’
assessment for the study authored by ARM and CJG was performed independently by UN and CJC (Martineau 2015). For all other
studies, ARM and one of CJC and APG independently assessed the risk of bias for each study. Where data from primary studies
conducted by review authors contributed to a given outcome, the quality of the evidence was assessed by review authors who were not
involved with those primary studies (CJC and AS).

The protocol specified that studies published as abstract only would be included, with a note to the effect that they were pending
definitive evaluation as and when fuller reports became available (Martineau 2015b). In conducting the review, where studies were
published as abstracts only, we contacted the study authors requesting full text of the trial report. Where this was unavailable, we listed
such studies as ’ongoing’.
The protocol specified that exacerbations precipitating emergency department attendance versus hospitalisation would be analysed
separately (Martineau 2015b). However, due to difficulties in differentiating such events, this outcome was pooled in the current
analysis.
The protocol did not specify that we would meta-analyse hazard ratios or that we would use generic inverse variance meta-analysis
(Martineau 2015b); however, we employed both techniques in the review.
The protocol did not specify that risk difference would be calculated for some analyses. This was added so that studies where no events
occurred could be included.
