Investigation performed at the Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation Center, Barnes-Jewish West County Hospital, Chesterfield, Missouri
Background: The physical risk factors leading to distal radial fractures are poorly understood. The goal of this study was
to compare postural stability between older adults with and without a prior distal radial fragility fracture.
Methods: This case-control evaluation was performed at a single tertiary institution. The fracture cohort comprised 23 pa-
tients treated for a low-energy distal radial fracture within 6 to 24 months prior to this study. Twenty-three age and sex-matched
control participants, without a prior fragility fracture, were selected from an outpatient clinic population. All participants com-
pleted a balance assessment with a computerized balance platform device. Dynamic motion analysis (DMA) scores ranging
from 0 to 1,440 points are produced, with lower scores indicating better postural stability. Participants also completed validated
questionnaires for general health quality (EuroQol-5D-3L [EQ-5D-3L]) and physical activity (Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly
[PASE]) and comprehensive health and demographic information including treatment for compromised balance or osteoporosis.
Statistical analysis compared data between cases and controls using either the Student t test or the Mann-Whitney U test.
Results: There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in age, sex, body mass index, physical activity score, or EQ-5D-3L
general health visual analog scale score between participants with or without prior distal radial fracture. The fracture cohort
demonstrated poorer balance, with higher DMA scores at 933 points compared with 790 points for the control cohort (p =
0.008). Nineteen patients (83%) in the fracture cohort reported having dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans within 5 years
prior to this study, but only 2 patients (9%) had ever been referred for balance training with physical therapy.
Conclusions: Older adults who sustain low-energy distal radial fractures demonstrate impaired postural stability compared
with individuals of a similar age who have not sustained such fractures. Following a distal radial fracture, these patients may
benefit from interventions to improve postural stability.
Level of Evidence: Prognostic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
F
ractures of the distal part of the radius constitute one-
sixth of all fractures seen in emergency departments in
the United States and occur in 15% of women older than
50 years of age
1-3. The majority of these fractures result from
standing-level falls
2,4. Although osteoporosis is a recognized risk
factor for fragility fractures, it explains only a small percentage of
the increased risk for distal radial fractures compared with age-
matched controls5. Other factors, such as impaired balance, may
play a role in the etiology of distal radial fractures in older adults
but are not fully understood.
Fragility fractures of the hip are commonly associated
with physically debilitated and frail individuals. However, de-
scribing those patients as being at risk for distal radial fractures
is not as intuitive
6,7. Some functional measures of physical per-
formance, such as the Timed Up and Go test and contralateral
grip strength, are decreased in patients who have sustained a
distal radial fracture3,8,9. Nevertheless, factors generally associated
with frailty, such as difficulty performing physical tasks, slower
walking speed, and inactive lifestyle, may actually be protective
for distal radial fractures because of reduced exposure to potential

 falls
3,4,6,10. Thus, the patients most at risk for distal radial fractures
may be those who have had a subtle decline of physical perfor-
mance and postural control but are not yet debilitated enough to
have a decrease in activity level8.
Providing evidence that physical decline increases risk
of distal radial fractures in older individuals has proven to be
challenging
3,4,6. Despite their frequent use, many “functional”
performance tests lack sensitivity in detecting impaired pos-
tural control in the osteoporotic population
11. For that reason,
objective outcome measures derived from computerized dy-
namic posturography tests, such as the PROPRIO 5000 (Perry
Dynamics), are thought to be more suitable
11-13. The PROPRIO
device differs from its predecessors in that it can accurately
measure a subject’s center of mass as a reaction to dynamic
stimuli meant to disrupt balance. Although it has external
validity to prior balance test systems, the PROPRIO 5000’s
unique ability to measure reactive balance to external dynamic
stimuli has theoretical advantages over previous methods of
postural stability testing
13,14.
The primary aim of this study was to determine if older
adults with a history of a distal radial fracture display differ-
ences in postural stability as measured by the PROPRIO 5000
when compared with adults of the same age without a history
of fracture. We hypothesized that patients who had sustained
an isolated low-energy distal radial fragility fracture would
demonstrate poorer postural stability compared with age and
sex-matched controls.
Materials and Methods
Patient Characteristics
I
nstitutional review board approval was obtained and all participants gave
informed consent. Participants in the fracture group were identified from a
clinical database of patients treated by a single department at a tertiary referral
center and were recruited by telephone. To be eligible for the study, participants
needed to have a history of distal radial fracture caused by a fall from a standing
height and to be 65 years of age or older at the time of injury. Patients were
enrolled at a minimum of 6 months (to reduce the influence of any temporary
effect of the injury) and a maximum of 24 months (to minimize health status
changes) after fracture. The mechanism was defined as “unintentionally coming
to rest on the ground, floor, or other lower level in a manner that did not result
from a major intrinsic event or an overwhelming hazard.” Participants were
required to be English-speaking and to have the cognitive ability to give their
informed consent without aid of a guardian. Participants were excluded if they
reported a medical condition causing severe balance disturbance—such as stroke,
seizure, or vertigo—and also if they had had any new-onset medical conditions in
the time since their distal radial fracture that could be reasonably assumed to
affect their balance. This included symptomatic musculoskeletal injuries in the
lower extremities or spine, or major medical illnesses or recent surgical proce-
dures. Chronic medical comorbidities or orthopaedic conditions present at the
time of wrist fracture were felt to be common contributors to balance distur-
bances in this population and were not grounds for exclusion.
Controls were recruited from the same outpatient clinic population by
offering a $25 stipend. Controls were matched by sex and age (within 2 years) to
fracture participants in a 1:1 ratio. Control participants had no history of any
geriatric fracture. Active disturbance in balance due to acute injury or dys-
function prompted exclusion. Similar to the fracture cohort, chronic medical
comorbidities or orthopaedic conditions were not grounds for exclusion.
Because of concerns about patient safety while conducting balance testing,
use of an assistive device for community ambulation or medical conditions ag-
gravated by exercise prompted exclusion from both participant groups.
Outcome Measures
Participants were asked about demographic characteristics, medications, medical
comorbidities, and musculoskeletal conditions. Additionally, they were inter-
viewed for a bone-health history including history of dual x-ray absorptiometry
(DXA) scans, vitamin D and calcium supplementation, and osteoporosis phar-
macotherapy. A self-reported fall history and history of balance-focused physical
therapy regimens were obtained. The written EuroQol-5D-3L (EQ-5D-3L)
general health survey
15 and Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE)
16
questionnaires were self-administered. The EQ-5D-3L questionnaire is a patient-
reported assessment of current health state on a visual analog scale (VAS) in
addition to a categorization of the level of perceived problems (choosing level
1 to 3) in 5 essential dimensions: Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/
Discomfort, and Anxiety/Depression. Height and weight were measured to
calculate body mass index (BMI).
Each patient underwent a standardized balance assessment using a
PROPRIO 5000 machine that quantifies dynamic postural stability. The system
uses a motorized multidirectional moving platform to disturb postural ho-
meostasis. An integrated ultrasonic sensor is placed at the participant’s lumbar
region (L5/S1) to measure movement of the center of mass in 6 degrees of
freedom every quarter-second of testing. The participants stood on the plat-
form with the feet a shoulder-width apart, the knees slightly flexed, and the
center of mass centered over the platform (Fig. 1). A 6-in (15.2-cm) piece of
rope was held in the patient’s hands to minimize the stabilizing effect of the
upper extremities. Formal testing consisted of three 2-minute tests interrupted
by 1-minute breaks. Each trial finished when one of the following criteria was
met: 2 minutes elapsed, the patient exceeded 3 in (7.6 cm) of displacement
in 0.25 second, the patient moved >5 in (12.7 cm) from the starting point,
the patient let go of the rope, the patient moved the feet, or the patient asked
to stop.

 Data Analysis
The PROPRIO 5000 system generates a composite balance score referred to as
the dynamic motion analysis (DMA) score. The DMA score, which ranges from
0 to 1,440 points, is calculated by integrated software that uses the sum of the
sensor’s vector moments and represents the total three-dimensional displace-
ment of the participant’s center of mass during testing. Lower scores are in-
dicative of less movement and therefore better postural control. The DMA score
includes a “dummy score” to account for remaining time in a trial. For example,
if a participant completes only 60 seconds of the 120-second test, a dummy
score of 720 points is added to the participant’s score that was obtained from the
initial 60 seconds of the test. The dummy score represents the maximum score
possible per assessment point left in the trial
17. A mean DMA score was cal-
culated for each patient on the basis of the 3 trials. The mean time elapsed for
each trial was also calculated among the 3 trials.
The PROPRIO 5000 and its accompanying DMA score are relatively
recent additions to the field of physical performance measurements. Prior
methods to measure differences in fall risk among varied populations have
included functional performance tests such as quadriceps strength testing, the
Timed Up and Go test, sway meters, and NeuroCom Sensory Organization Test
(Natus)11. Although many of its capabilities as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool
are still being catalogued and understood, the DMA score has been studied in
other clinical settings
17 and has been validated relative to other assessment
technologies in the field
13,14.
A sample size analysis was performed prior to study initiation using the
baseline data from a prior study that used the PROPRIO 5000 in an older
population that had undergone hip arthroplasty and had a mean DMA score
(and standard deviation) of 807 ± 44.7 points
17. The minimal clinically im-
portant difference of the DMA scores was calculated to be 22 points on the basis
of the distribution-based method of halving the standard deviation (effect size,
0.5)
18. To achieve a power of 0.8 at a 0.05 level of significance using the two-
sided unpaired t test, it was determined that we would need 33 patients per
group to prove the 22-point minimal clinically important difference. An in-
terim analysis was planned to check data variance, as PROPRIO 5000 testing of
patients after distal radial fracture had not been performed previously, to our
knowledge. This analysis demonstrated a larger-than-expected difference in the
primary outcome that was already significant at 46 total patients; thus, data
collection was stopped prior to full enrollment.
The distributions of the continuous outcome measures were tested for
normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Age, height, BMI, numbers of
medications and medical comorbidities, PASE scores, elapsed time, and DMA
scores were normally distributed among the study population and were compared
between groups using the Student t test. Weight, EQ-5D-3LVAS scores, and DXA
T-scores were not normally distributed and were compared using Mann-Whitney
U testing. All other outcomes were recorded as categorical variables, which were
compared between the two participant groups using either chi-square or Fisher
exact tests. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20 (IBM).
Results
A
fter participant recruitment and appropriate screening, 30
patients in the fracture group and 25 patients in the control
group completed testing (Fig. 2). Twenty-three members of each
group met matching conditions and were included in the sta-
tistical analysis. Baseline characteristics demonstrated no signif-
icant differences between groups except for an increased number
of reported falls among fracture participants (p = 0.04) (Table I).
There were also no significant differences between groups with
regard to self-reported physical activity (PASE score) (p = 0.85)
and perceived overall health (EQ-5D-3L) (p = 0.23).
Neither the mean number of medical comorbidities per
individual in each group nor the mean number of medications
differed between study groups (Table I). The number of sub-
jects taking ‡4 medications, which has been implicated in falls
in the older population
19, was not significantly different (p =
0.546) between the fracture group (12 patients) and the control
group (15 patients). Specific medications known to contrib-
ute to falls in this population did not differ significantly among
the groups, including diuretics for treatment of hypertension
(12 patients in the fracture group compared with 14 patients in
the control group; p = 0.532), hypoglycemic agents for dia-
betes mellitus (3 patients in the fracture group compared with
1 patient in the control group; p = 0.608), and psychoactive

and the control group did not differ in their prevalence of
potential musculoskeletal confounders (p = 1.00 for both) in
the lower extremity (4 patients in the fracture group compared
with 3 patients in the control group) or spine (4 patients in the
fracture group compared with 3 patients in the control group).
The fracture cohort had significantly decreased postural
stability (p = 0.008) when compared with the control cohort,
as demonstrated by higher DMA scores (933 points for the
fracture group compared with 790 points for the control group)
(Fig. 3). The fracture cohort also continued the balance test
for significantly less time than the control cohort (p < 0.01)
(Table I).

 Thirty-nine participants (85%) reported having had a
DXA scan within the last 5 years before the current study, with
nearly equal prevalence in each group (Table II). Thirty-three
patients (72%) were actively taking calcium and vitamin D
supplements, and 4 patients (9%) were actively taking pre-
scription medication for osteoporosis, again with no differ-
ences between groups. Only 3 patients (7%) had completed a
therapy evaluation or treatment regimen to address potential
balance deficiencies (Table II). Additionally, the groups were
similar in 4 of the dimensions of general health state on the
EQ-5D-3L questionnaire, but not for mobility. The difference
detected in the mobility subscore revealed that a dispropor-
tionate number of patients in the fracture cohort perceived
increased difficulty with mobility (p = 0.03) (Fig. 4).
Discussion
U
sing modern technology to measure postural stability, we
explored the association between physical performance
and distal radial fractures. Our data indicate that postural
stability is impaired among older adults with a prior distal
radial fracture when compared with individuals without a
history of fragility fracture. This difference occurred in the
absence of any appreciable disparity in age, sex, BMI, level of
physical activity, or general health between our samples from
these populations. This indicates a subtle, yet measurable, im-
pairment in postural stability in patients who sustain distal
radial fractures.
Our data build upon the evaluation of physical perfor-
mance by Cho et al.
8 as a risk factor for distal radial fractures
using the Short Physical Performance Battery, grip strength,
and time spent walking daily in matched cohorts. Although the
overall summary score showed no differences, some individual
components such as the chair stand test and contralateral grip
strength demonstrated decreased physical performance in the
fracture cohort
8.
Although functional performance tests such as those
used by Cho et al.
8 can be criticized as lacking sensitivity
11, the
detection of these intrinsic differences reveals a need for a more
refined investigation of the physical risk factors using more
sensitive quantitative methods such as computerized balance
platforms
7.
The findings of the present study have several implica-
tions. Falls are the most common cause of nonfatal injury and
hospital admission in older adults, with estimated direct med-
ical costs approaching $30 billion annually, in the United States
21.
Reducing the incidence and morbidity of falls is thus a prom-
inent public health priority
22. In addition to their own associated
morbidity and costs, distal radial fractures can be considered
sentinel events as they are associated with an estimated 2 to
4 times increased risk of subsequent hip fractures among older
adults
23-26. If these patients could be identified prior to wrist
fracture or more severe injury, interventions to improve postural
control could be implemented. A recent Cochrane systematic
review confirms the effectiveness of specific exercise programs
in reducing the rate of falls, namely programs combining both
balance training and muscle strengthening, or tai chi classes
in certain populations
27-30.
With regard to fragility fracture treatment, the current
American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) posi-
tion
31 encourages the treating surgeon to “advise patients with
fragility fractures that an osteoporosis evaluation may lead to
treatment which can reduce the risk of future fractures.” No-
tably absent are any recommendations to consider the role of
balance training and physical conditioning when evaluating
a patient with a fragility fracture of the forearm or elsewhere.
Current practice trends mirror these guidelines, as evaluation
for osteoporosis is becoming a common consideration following
these injuries
32,33, and assessment and treatment of fall risk are
more often overlooked
34,35.
There were several potential limitations to this study.
Although PROPRIO 5000 use is becoming more widespread
because of its potential advantages, it is still a newer technology.
The full utility and meaning of the DMA score remain to be
seen, but we believe that there is enough data to support this
method of measuring balance. Additionally, there was potential
for selection bias in this study due to the recruitment method.
Recruitment was limited only to those who were willing to
return to the clinic for balance testing and therefore likely ex-
cluded those patients with poor mobility and decreased inde-
pendence. However, both groups were recruited from the same
clinic population; thus, both groups were assumed to be
equally skewed. We attempted to control for other potential
confounders by ensuring that the study groups were sex and
age-matched, and both groups proved to be similar in terms of
demographic characteristics, health state, and physical activity
level. Although patients were excluded for health events that

 would grossly change postural stability following a radial frac-
ture, we acknowledge that a patient’s health could change
subtly within 24 months after a distal radial fracture. To min-
imize bias attributable to this, we matched subjects by age at the
time of study testing such that any deterioration in postural
stability with aging should have equally impacted patients in
the case and control groups.
Lastly, although an association between decreased pos-
tural stability and distal radial fracture incidence was demon-
strated, causality cannot be established without a longitudinal
study design. The study provides evidence that postural sta-
bility is compromised after distal radial fracture in the older
adult, but we cannot differentiate if instability was present prior
to fracture and played a contributing role in the event, or
whether it is a consequence of the fall itself. To minimize the
physical effects of the fracture event, we chose to evaluate pa-
tients who had sustained a distal radial fracture more than 6
months prior to the start of this study and also took steps to
ensure that it was an isolated wrist injury without neurologic
or musculoskeletal compromise outside of the afflicted upper
extremity. Unlike proximal femoral or vertebral compression
fractures, which result in permanent alterations in a patient’s
lower-extremity function and balance, distal radial fractures
offer a unique model to potentially study a patient’s preexisting
postural stability deficit after injury has occurred as no per-
manent change in postural control should occur as a result of a
wrist fracture35,36. Additionally, psychological effects from the
fracture event itself may also affect balance. Fear of falling has
been implicated as a risk factor for subsequent falls in prior
studies
37, and this cannot be mitigated with our current study
design. Interestingly, the self-reported EQ-5D-3L mobility
measure is the only subscore that differed in the patients in the
fracture group compared with those in the control group,
which may be a reflection of patient loss of confidence or fear as
a result of the fracture event. It remains unclear if the difficulty
mobilizing was present prior to the fracture event itself.
Although deficiencies in physical performance have been
long suspected in patients who sustain distal radial fractures, the
strength of this association has been difficult to prove
3,4,6. This
study provides quantitative evidence that there is compromised
postural stability in older patients who have sustained distal
radial fractures. Clinical practice may need to be modified to
address this major contributor to falls and fragility fractures
through interventions proven to improve balance, such as pro-
grams combining both balance training and muscle strength-
ening or tai chi classes
27-30. Future studies should further examine
the association between postural stability and wrist fractures and
should determine if treating existing postural instability reduces
the risk of subsequent fragility fractures. n
