larly in the case of horizontal gene transfer whereby one 
bacterial species obtains virulence factors from another 
species in its environment, allowing it to trigger the onset 
of disease (for example, Bacteroides in pouchitis17).
The metagenomic approach, in which the combined 
genomes of a microbial community are studied in their 
entirety (including viruses and fungi), has allowed for 
a more comprehensive characterization of the human 
microbiome.18 It is complemented by metatranscriptom‑
ics, which defines the collection of genes expressed by a 
particular microbial community, and by metaproteom‑
ics and metabolomics, which define the proteins and 
metabolites (such as short and medium chain fatty acids) 
collectively produced (or metabolized) by the microorgan‑
isms (table 1).21 22 Whole genome shotgun sequencing is 
used to infer the functional or enzymatic capabilities of 
the identified microorganisms.20
This review summarizes current understanding of the 
biological roles that the microbiome plays in health and dis‑
ease. It assesses the evidence linking alterations in human 
microbiome homeostasis (that is, dysbiosis19) to the develop‑
ment of autoimmune disease in humans and animal models. 
Although no guidelines are available, we also present a crit‑
ical assessment of tested dietary interventions to ameliorate 
these disorders as well as data on pre/probiotics. Finally, we 
discuss novel concepts and ways of restoring a physiologi‑
cal microbial community by bacteriotherapy (that is, fecal 
microbiota transplant)24 and related approaches that can 
improve and even cure these conditions.

Introduction, definitions, and nomenclature
Humans are a complex collection of mammalian and 
prokaryotic cells. Recent estimates suggest that the 
ratio of bacterial to human cells is approximately one to 
one.1 The term “microbiota” refers to the microbial flora, 
which represents symbiotic, commensal, and pathogenic 
microorganisms (also known as pathobionts2) harbored 
by humans. The microbiome represents the collective 
genomes of these microorganisms.3 4 Although a person’s 
microbiome is relatively stable and resilient over time, 
environmental factors that can alter the composition 
include diet,5 probiotics (which contain live beneficial 
bacteria),6 7 prebiotics (which contain supplements that 
promote the growth of specific bacteria),6 7 viruses,8 and 
drugs, particularly antibiotics.9
Before advances in DNA sequencing technology, the 
diversity of the human microbiome was greatly underap‑
preciated. At least 80% of microorganisms could not be 
identified using standard culturing techniques.10 With the 
advent of high throughput DNA sequencing, bacteria and 
archaea are now identified on the basis on the 16 small 
ribosomal subunit RNA (16S rRNA), a gene that is dis‑
tinctive of prokaryotic cells.11 The 16S rRNA subunit has 
highly conserved regions common to most bacteria, as well 
as hypervariable regions unique to each species of bacte‑
ria. This allows for sequencing (via universal polymerase 
chain reaction primers) and taxonomic identification of the 
bacteria present in a community without amplification of 
human DNA.12‑14 The equivalent method in fungi uses the 
internal transcribed spacer (ITS), 18S rRNA, or 26S rRNA 
regions.15 Although the 16S sequencing technology can 
be used to profile a particular microbial community, it is 
limited in defining bacterial species and differentiating 
between commensal and pathogenic strains,16 particu‑
The role of the gut microbiome in 
systemic inflammatory disease
Jose C Clemente,1 Julia Manasson,2 Jose U Scher2
ABSTRACT
The role of the gut microbiome in models of inflammatory and autoimmune disease 
is now well characterized. Renewed interest in the human microbiome and its 
metabolites, as well as notable advances in host mucosal immunology, has opened 
multiple avenues of research to potentially modulate inflammatory responses. The 
complexity and interdependence of these diet-microbe-metabolite-host interactions 
are rapidly being unraveled. Importantly, most of the progress in the field comes 
from new knowledge about the functional properties of these microorganisms in 
physiology and their effect in mucosal immunity and distal inflammation. This review 
summarizes the preclinical and clinical evidence on how dietary, probiotic, prebiotic, 
and microbiome based therapeutics affect our understanding of wellness and 
disease, particularly in autoimmunity.

complex plant carbohydrates into short chain fatty acids 
(SCFAs)—an energy source for gut epithelial cells, also 
serving an anti‑inflammatory function by inhibiting 
histone deacetylases in regulatory T cells (Tregs) through 
G‑protein coupled receptors (GPRs)25; synthesizes essen‑
tial vitamins and amino acids; regulates fat metabo‑
lism26 27; produces small molecules that interact with the 
host environment28; and shapes the development of the 
immune system.29 For example, non‑ribosomal peptide 
synthetase gene clusters, which have been exclusively 
identified in gut associated bacteria, produce small mol‑
ecule dipeptide aldehydes, some of which act as protease 
inhibitors of cathepsins known to be important in antigen 
processing and presentation.28 30 Other small molecules 
include N‑acyl amides, which interact with GPRs,31 and 
glycyl radical enzymes such as propanediol dehydratase 
(PduC), which correlates with epithelial adhesion and cel‑
lular invasion, using fucose for fermentation and metabo‑
lism.32 33 Furthermore, recent studies have shown that the 
adhesion of certain microbes (for example, segmented 
filamentous bacteria, Citrobacter rodentium, and Escheri-
chia coli O157) to intestinal epithelial cells is necessary to 
trigger a T helper 17 (Th17) cell response.34
Microbial composition and colonization are, in turn, 
influenced by factors such as the neonatal mode of deliv‑
ery, breast feeding, diet, treatment with antibiotics, and 
environmental exposures early in life.7 A dysbiotic state 
can lead to dysregulation of the various functions listed 
above, which can in turn contribute to the development 
of autoimmune conditions such as inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD), systemic inflammatory arthritis, multiple 
sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Avail‑
able data are summarized in figure 1 and discussed in 
detail below.
Inflammatory bowel disease
Two major clinical phenotypes of IBD exist: ulcerative 
colitis and Crohn’s disease. Evidence for the importance 
of microbiota in disease pathogenesis comes from obser‑
vations that colitis is significantly attenuated or absent 
in germ‑free animals and those treated with antibiot‑
ics.35‑37 Conversely, Bacteroides, Enterobacteriaceae, Por-
phyromonas, Akkermansia muciniphila, and Clostridium 
ramosum are enriched in several animal models of IBD 
and are associated with higher levels of inflammation.37 
In humans, there is an overall trend toward lower biodi‑
versity, increased abundance of Bacteroides and Entero‑
bacteriaceae, and decreased abundance of Firmicutes in 
people with IBD compared with controls.38 39
Studies note a reduction of certain commensal 
microbes in IBD, particularly SCFA producers. These 
include Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Leuconostocaceae, 
Odoribacter splanchnius, Phascolarctobacterium, and 
Roseburia.40F prausnitzii and Roseburia hominis both pro‑
duce butyrate, which is known to induce the differentia‑
tion of Treg via the GPR43 receptor.6 41 Both taxa inversely 
correlate with disease activity of ulcerative colitis.41 
Furthermore, reduction of F prausnitzii has been linked 
to postoperative recurrence of Crohn’s disease, and its 
administration in mouse models reduces gut inflamm
ation.42Phascolarctobacterium produces propionate in

nization with indigenous Lactobacillus bifidus.49IL1rn−/− 
mice show gut dysbiosis characterized by lower microbial 
richness (number of taxa present) and diversity (how 
different taxa are from one another), mainly driven by a 
decrease in Ruminococcus and Prevotella genera.50
K/BxN T cell receptor transgenic mice develop inflam‑
matory arthritis mediated by T cell recognition and 
production of antibody against glucose‑6‑phosphate 
isomerase, a ubiquitous self antigen.51 Once again, 
arthritis is mitigated when animals are raised in a germ‑
free environment or treated from birth with vancomycin 
or ampicillin but occurs with the reintroduction of seg‑
mented filamentous bacteria.52
Finally, a more recent study of DBA1 mice, in which 
arthritis can be induced with the introduction of high 
quality collagen, showed that animals raised in germ‑
free conditions and subsequently colonized with micro‑
biota from collagen induced arthritis (CIA) susceptible 
mice were more prone to develop inflammatory arthritis 
than were animals colonized with microbiota from CIA 
resistant mice.53 Interestingly, administration of SCFAs 
acetate, propionate, and butyrate to CIA and K/BxN mice 
had opposite effects on disease severity, both clinically 
and histologically, with phenotype abrogation in CIA 
mice and aggravation of arthritis in K/BxN mice.54
Rheumatoid arthritis—human studies
Microbiome involvement has also been shown in human 
studies of rheumatoid arthritis. In the gut, patients with 
new onset rheumatoid arthritis (NORA) are enriched in 
Prevotella copri at the expense of Bacteroides species.55 
The abundance of P copri is also lower in people with 
DRB1 shared epitope alleles that confer an enhanced risk 
for disease development.55 Analysis of NORA metagen‑
omes shows a reduction of genes encoding vitamin and 
purine metabolic enzymes (including those responsible 
for tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis important for metho‑
trexate metabolism) and an increase in cysteine metabolic 
enzymes.55 Furthermore, inoculation of germ‑free BALB/c 
ZAP‑70W163C mutant (SKG) mice with fecal samples from 
rheumatoid arthritis patients that were dominated by 
P copri caused the development of severe arthritis in a 
Th17 dependent manner,56 although the SKG model is 
now considered to be more representative of spondyloar‑
thritis than of rheumatoid arthritis.
Spondyloarthritis—animal studies
The intestinal microbiome likewise contributes to animal 
models of spondyloarthritis, a group of inflammatory con‑
ditions with shared features of axial skeleton arthritis, 
enthesitis, uveitis, colitis, dermatologic involvement, 
and association with the HLA‑B27 allele. ANKylosing 
ENThesopathy (ANKENT) mice spontaneously develop 
progressive enthesitis and ankylosis of the tarsal joints 
resembling human ankylosing spondylitis,57 but they fail 
to do so when raised in germ‑free conditions.58 However, 
enthesitis and ankylosis ensue when these animals are 
colonized with commensal intestinal bacteria.59 Similarly, 
SKG mice develop a chronic autoimmune arthritis due to a 
single point mutation in ZAP‑70, a T cell signal transduc‑
tion molecule,60 which is prevented by rearing animals in 
the presence of Paraprevotella, which also induces the 
production of Tregs.6 43 At the same time, several patho‑
bionts are enhanced in IBD, including Escherichia coli, 
Shigella, Rhodococcus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 
Prevotellaceae, Clostridium difficile, Klebsiella pneumo-
niae, Proteus mirabilis, and Helicobacter hepaticus.44 This 
dysbiotic shift in favor of pathobionts is thought to con‑
tribute to perturbations in the immune function of lamina 
propria cells, ultimately resulting in inflammation and 
progression to disease.45
Similarly, a microbiome survey of patients with new 
onset, treatment‑naive Crohn’s disease showed that 
Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroidales, Clostridiales, Pas‑
teurellaceae, Veillonellaceae, Neisseriaceae, and Fuso‑
bacteriaceae positively correlated with disease, whereas 
Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroides, Fae-
calibacterium, Roseburia, Blautia, Ruminococcus, and 
Coprococcus negatively correlated with disease in biopsy 
samples from the ileum and rectum.46 Exposure to antibi‑
otics further amplified the microbial dysbiosis. Interest‑
ingly, some of these differences were not observed in stool 
samples collected at the time of diagnosis, suggesting that 
the predictive power differs according to sample size and 
that predictive accuracy of disease pathogenesis and pro‑
gression can potentially be improved by combining sam‑
pling strategies with clinical information.46
A novel approach to determine specific bacteria that 
affect susceptibility to disease has been to identify IgA 
coated bacteria. The presumption is that taxa coated 
with high concentrations of IgA correlate with a higher 
inflammatory response and are predictive of disease state. 
This technique, termed IgA‑Seq, has been accomplished 
through a combination of flow cytometry based bacterial 
sorting and 16S rRNA gene sequencing.47 One of the first 
studies to use this approach showed that colonization 
of germ‑free mice with human IBD intestinal microbiota 
characterized by high levels of IgA coating induced more 
severe forms of colitis than did colonization with micro‑
biota characterized by low levels of IgA coating.47 Another 
more recent study showed that people with Crohn’s dis‑
ease and associated peripheral spondyloarthritis were 
enriched in E coli coated with IgA compared with those 
without peripheral spondyloarthritis.48 Furthermore, 
colonization of wild‑type, germ‑free mice with isolates 
of this IgA coated E coli induced a Th17 response that was 
dependent on the presence of the pduC gene.48 Although 
still in its infancy, this technique may be important in the 
identification of potential pathobionts, which has direct 
implications for disease stratification and treatment.
Systemic inflammatory arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis—animal studies
Several animal models of inflammatory arthritis resem‑
bling human rheumatoid arthritis have shown a relation 
between the microbiome and development of disease. 
For instance, interleukin 1 receptor antagonist knockout 
(IL1rn−/−) mice spontaneously develop a T cell mediated 
arthritis that is dependent on toll‑like receptor (TLR) acti‑
vation by microbial flora. Whereas the arthritis phenotype 
is prevented when mice are maintained under germ‑free 
conditions, advanced inflammation is induced by recolo‑

responses, and results in neuron demyelination.72 Mice 
maintained in germ‑free or pathogen‑free environments 
are resistant to the development of EAE, produce lower 
concentrations of the inflammatory cytokines interferon‑γ 
and interleukin 17A, and up‑regulate the production of 
Tregs.73 74 Similar to other autoimmunity models, recoloni‑
zation with conventional commensal microbiota induces 
the development of EAE in a Th17 dependent manner.74 75 
Moreover, administration of antibiotics ameliorates EAE 
and down‑regulates the production of pro‑inflammatory 
cytokines as well as systemic Th17 cells.76
Intestinal microbiota are involved in many CNS func‑
tions—regulating blood‑brain barrier permeability, acti‑
vating microglia, reducing astrocyte pathogenesis, and 
expressing genes necessary for myelination.72 One recent 
study of piglets even showed that certain gut microbiota 
may be predictive of neurometabolite concentrations.77 In 
humans, 16S sequencing studies have shown a reduction 
in the abundance of Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Prevo-
tella, Butyricimonas, and Collinsella, with enrichment of 
Bifidobaterium, Streptococcus, Methanobrevibacter, and 
Akkermansia muciniphila.72
Several taxa that are reduced in multiple sclerosis pro‑
duce the SCFA butyrate, which has been implicated in the 
up‑regulation of Tregs (as mentioned above), maintenance 
of blood‑brain barrier integrity, and modulation of micro‑
glia activity.72 The introduction of long chain fatty acids 
into animal models exacerbates EAE by decreasing the 
amount of intestinal SCFAs and up‑regulating the Th1/
Th17 cell populations in the small intestine. In contrast, 
treatment with SCFAs, particularly propionate, amelio‑
rates EAE via up‑regulation of Tregs and interleukin 10, 
an anti‑inflammatory cytokine.78 Concentrations of lipid 
654, a TLR2 agonist produced by Bacteroidetes, is lower 
in people with multiple sclerosis.79
Although the role of TLR2 is controversial in human 
and animal models of multiple sclerosis, up‑regulation of 
TLR2 mRNA expression is noted in the spinal cord of EAE 
mice.80 Furthermore, administration of lipid 654 results 
in TLR2 tolerance and ameliorates EAE.81 Polysaccha‑
ride A produced by Bacteroides fragilis promotes Tregs and 
protects against CNS inflammation and demyelination 
in the EAE model.82 Dietary tryptophan is metabolized 
by intestinal microbiota into aryl hydrocarbon receptor 
agonists, which limit CNS inflammation by acting on 
astrocytes and mitigates EAE in animals. Importantly, 
concentrations of aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonists 
are significantly lower in patients with multiple sclerosis 
than in controls.83
Systemic lupus erythematosus
SLE is a heterogeneous chronic inflammatory disease 
that can affect virtually every organ and varies between 
patients. It is driven by the production of autoantibod‑
ies leading to the formation of antigen‑antibody immune 
complexes. Similar to other autoimmune conditions, 
when lupus prone New Zealand Black (NZB) mice were 
reared in a germ‑free environment, they had lower rates 
and reduced severity of renal disease.84
In contrast, lupus prone MRL/Mp‑Faslpr (MRL/lpr) 
mice reared in a germ‑free environment had lower rates 
germ‑free conditions (despite ongoing production of auto‑
immune T cells) or treatment with antifungals. Arthritis 
is provoked in germ‑free mice by the injection of the fun‑
gal β‑glucans zymosan, curdlan, or laminarin.61 Finally, 
the HLA‑B27 transgenic rat model of spondyloarthritis 
that maintains multiple copies of HLA‑B27 and human 
β2‑microglobulin transgenes remains healthy when 
reared in a germ‑free environment but develops periph‑
eral arthritis as well as intestinal inflammation with the 
introduction of commensal intestinal bacteria.62 These 
transgenic animals have an intestinal dysbiosis marked 
by higher abundance of Paraprevotella and lower abun‑
dance of Rikenellaceae.63 Furthermore, there is evidence 
of an age dependent progressive dysbiosis associated 
with a reduction of Firmicutes and concomitant increase 
of Proteobacteria and Akkermansia municiphila, as well 
as a higher frequency of IgA coated bacteria. These per‑
turbations are associated with enhanced expression of 
Th1 and Th17 cytokines, expansion of colonic Th17 cells, 
dysregulation of antimicrobial peptide expression, and 
up‑regulation of bacterial specific IgA.64 HLA‑B27 expres‑
sion in these animals has a significant effect on both host 
and microbial metabolites as early as 6 weeks of age. Of 
particular interest is the fact that treatment with the SCFA 
propionate attenuates the development of arthritis.65
Spondyloarthritis—human studies
In human studies, patients with ankylosing spondy‑
litis have been shown to have a distinct gut microbial 
signature compared with healthy people, with higher 
abundance of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, 
Rikenellaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, and Bacteroi‑
daceae, and lower abundance of Veillonellaceae and 
Prevotellaceae.66 In pediatric enthesitis related arthritis, 
a type of juvenile spondyloarthritis, there is decreased 
abundance of intestinal F prausnitzii (similar to IBD),67 
and multi‑omics analysis shows lower functional meta‑
bolic potential.68 The intestinal microbiome is also altered 
in psoriatic arthritis, in which there is overall decreased 
diversity marked by lower abundance of Coprococcus, 
Akkermansia, Ruminococcus, and Pseudobutyrivibrio, 
which correlates with higher concentrations of secre‑
tory IgA and lower concentrations of receptor activator 
of nuclear factor κ‑B ligand as well as reduced concen‑
trations of the medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) hex‑
anoate and heptanoate.69 Interestingly, Akkermansia and 
Ruminococcus are both mucin degrading intestinal bac‑
teria that produce SCFAs and are important for intestinal 
homeostasis.69
Multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disorder 
caused by demyelination of the central nervous sys‑
tem (CNS). Its course is highly variable, although many 
patients develop progressive irreversible neurologic disa‑
bility.70 Several experiments in animal models of multiple 
sclerosis, called experimental autoimmune encephalo‑
myelitis (EAE), imply that intestinal microorganisms con‑
tribute to disease pathogenesis.25 71 EAE is induced by the 
injection of a myelin protein with a bacterial adjuvant, 
which acts as a self antigen, promotes Th1 and Th17

recent randomized crossover study showed how glycemic 
response to two single week dietary interventions based 
on consumption of white bread or sourdough leavened 
wholegrain bread was determined by pre‑intervention 
microbiome composition.92
The mechanisms linking diet, microbiome composi‑
tion, and host function are still being elucidated. Prefer‑
ence for different types of nutrients is one possible route 
through which dietary interventions modify the microbi‑
ome and, subsequently, host physiology. Evidence from 
studies of human populations with different diets (par‑
ticularly Western versus agrarian/traditional diets) sup‑
port this hypothesis, with an enrichment of Bacteroides in 
protein rich diets in contrast to Prevotella in carbohydrate 
based diets.93 94 Luminal pH, which varies naturally along 
the gastrointestinal tract,95 can also modulate the gut 
microbiome composition and, concomitantly, be altered 
by bacterial byproducts.
As discussed, SCFAs are a final product of bacterial 
fiber fermentation, which can modify intestinal pH. 
Vegans, for instance, have lower intestinal pH than omni‑
vores.96 Diets high in fiber benefit the growth of those 
bacteria capable of fermenting dietary fibers,97 which 
can result in the inhibition of Th2 cell differentiation.98 
These dietary derived SCFAs act as important immune 
modulators, as described before. Butyrate, an important 
SCFA involved in various host immune responses, pro‑
vides energy to enterocytes and can improve barrier func‑
tion.99 As discussed, it can also induce the differentiation 
of intestinal Tregs through the expression of FoxP3.100 
Importantly, as in the case of EAE and CIA amelioration, 
the effect of SCFAs can happen at other distal sites, as 
SCFAs produced in the gut can also suppress inflamma‑
tion in the lung.98
Dietary studies in IBD
Various dietary studies in IBD have shown a beneficial, if 
only transitory, effect in patients (supplementary table A). 
A lower likelihood of relapse in patients with ulcerative 
colitis was observed in a study of a low sulfur diet, which 
is known to decrease H2S production, improving epithe‑
lial permeability and enhancing utilization of butyrate 
by colonocytes.101 Diets with complex carbohydrates 
that remove the use of simple sugars have also shown 
clinical benefits in pediatric Crohn’s disease.102 103 Finally, 
exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) can induce remission 
of Crohn’s disease in pediatric populations.104 This type 
of therapy consists of restricted use of liquid feeding 
with an elemental or polymeric formula for six to eight 
weeks. EEN can reduce pro‑inflammatory acetic acid 
and increase the concentration of butyric acid, which 
has anti‑inflammatory properties.105 Despite its success 
in children, EEN is not easily applicable to adult popu‑
lations owing to its unpleasant taste. However, promis‑
ing results have been reported in patients with newly 
diagnosed Crohn’s disease who can adhere to this type 
of diet.106 Unfortunately, many of these studies in IBD 
provide limited, if any, evidence on how the microbiome 
changes in response to the dietary intervention, so our 
understanding of bacterial mechanisms that mediate 
their benefits is limited.
of nephritis only when they were fed an ultrafiltered anti‑
gen‑free diet.85 A recent study characterized the intesti‑
nal microbiota of MRL/lpr mice, showing enrichment in 
Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Rikenellaceae, 
with concomitant reduction in Lactobacillaceae com‑
pared with control MRL/Mp mice. Interestingly, exposure 
to retinoic acid restored Lactobacillaceae abundance, 
which correlated with an improved clinical phenotype.86 
Human studies are sparse, but two investigations in Span‑
ish and Chinese cohorts showed a decreased Firmicutes/
Bacteroidetes ratio in patients with SLE compared with 
healthy controls.87 88 Furthermore, in vitro cultures of iso‑

Th17 differentiation.89
Dietary studies in human IBD and autoimmune arthritis: 
clinical evidence
Given the strong correlation between the gut microbiome 
and human health, it is plausible that factors affecting 
the microbial composition can be leveraged to indirectly 
modulate inflammatory disease. Among them, diet has 
been one of the most extensively studied owing to its 
amenability to modification and relatively safe profile, 
as well patients’ predisposition to try therapies that are 
perceived as more “natural.” Although the effect of die‑
tary interventions in human health has been studied for 
centuries (take the Hippocratic phrase “all disease begins 
in the gut”), only recently have we begun to understand 
how changes in nutrient intake affect intestinal bacterial 
composition.
A pioneering study compared the effect of randomizing 
10 healthy people to either a high fat/low fiber diet or a 
low fat/high fiber diet on gut microbiome composition 
in 10 healthy people who were insulated for 10 days.90 
Although changes in bacterial diversity and composi‑
tionwere significant and occurred quickly (within the 
first day) after the dietary intervention, the magnitude 
of the perturbation was both low and insufficient to shift 
the microbiome of a participant into a different configura‑
tion, with samples clustering according to participants 
rather than diet.
Another randomized dietary intervention study com‑
pared two different diets in 11 healthy volunteers who 
followed two different diets for four days: one based 
exclusively on animal products (composed primarily of 
meats, eggs, and cheese) and the other based on plant 
products (enriched in grains, legumes, fruits, and veg‑
etables).5 Each diet resulted in microbial changes con‑
sistent with differences in the microbiome of carnivorous 
and herbivorous mammals,91 with the animal based diet 
enriched in protein degradation whereas the plant based 
diet increased bacterial functions related to carbohydrate 
fermentation. Importantly, these differences at the com‑
munity level were also reflected in significant changes 
in bacterial gene expression. Despite marked inter‑
individual baseline differences, all samples clustered by 
diet rather than by participant at the end of the interven‑
tion. In contrast to these and other studies of high fat 
versus low fat diets, the literature is less abundant on 
how specific dietary components might interact with the 
microbiome to induce host responses. Among these, a

sively studied. In population based studies, intake of 
fish oil was associated with a modest reduction in the 
risk of rheumatoid arthritis,122 with the premise that 
omega fatty acids could be responsible for their preven‑
tive effects.123 124 A recent dose‑response meta‑analysis 
reported a non‑significant inverse association between 
fish consumption and rheumatoid arthritis.107 In support 
of this observation, other studies have shown beneficial 
effects of fish oil in patients with established rheuma‑
toid arthritis and as a complementary intervention to 
triple disease modifying antirheumatic drug therapy in 
early rheumatoid arthritis.125 126 The inverse association 
between fish oil consumption and rheumatoid arthritis 
has mainly been attributed to the abundance of long 
chain n‑3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish,127 which in 
turn promote eicosanoid synthesis and its downstream 
molecular and clinical anti‑inflammatory effects.128
Studies in animal models have suggested that dietary 
extra‑virgin olive oil prevents collagen induced arthri‑
tis via down‑regulation of pro‑inflammatory cytokines, 
including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 
17,129 likely owing to the effects of high concentrations of 
phenolic compounds (such as hydroxytyrosol) present in 
olive oil.130 Another intriguing explanation for the inverse 
association between fish and olive oil and rheumatoid 
arthritis derives from studies showing that the microbiota 
from animals fed a diet rich in saturated fats led to TLR 
driven inflammation via production of CCL2, a mediator 
of macrophage chemotaxis. Strikingly, the gut microbi‑
ota of mice fed with fish oil promoted anti‑inflammatory 
responses when transplanted into obese animals, which 
suggests a possible biologic mechanism for saturated 
lipid induced, microbiota driven modulation of metabolic 
inflammation.131
Findings from several studies suggest that increased 
consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with 
reduced risk of rheumatoid arthritis.123 132 This effect is, 
perhaps, mainly due to the antioxidant content of fruits 
and vegetables. The large prospective Iowa Women’s 
Health Study did not show a significant association 
between fruit intake and the risk of rheumatoid arthritis 
but did show a modest inverse association between con‑
sumption of cruciferous vegetables and the risk of this 
disease.
Red meat
Most of the evidence correlating intake of red meat and 
incidence of rheumatoid arthritis derives from large epi‑
demiologic cohorts. A prospective study found that a 
high intake of meat was associated with an increased 
risk of rheumatoid arthritis,133 although the Nurses’ 
Health Study found no initial evidence of such an asso‑
ciation.134 However, when the two Nurses’ Health Study 
cohorts with more incident cases of rheumatoid arthri‑
tis were combined, lower red meat intake was found to 
be significantly associated with decreased risk of early 
onset rheumatoid arthritis.115 Similarly, high sodium 
consumption was also associated with increased risk 
of rheumatoid arthritis,135 136 perhaps through expan‑
sion of Th17 cells via activation of serum glucocorticoid 
kinase.137
Dietary studies in rheumatoid arthritis
Over the past decade, a large body of evidence has char‑
acterized the mechanisms by which nutrients and specific 
foods could alter the gut microbial ecology and the down‑
stream production of immune modulating metabolites, 
ultimately orchestrating local and distal autoimmune phe‑
notypes. Concomitantly, a variety of clinical and epidemio‑
logic studies have looked at the potential beneficial effects 
of well defined diets on inflammatory arthritis and related 
disorders.107‑110 Included among those with established 
associations and/or demonstrated clinical efficacy are the 
Mediterranean diet, increased fish and olive oil intake, and 
decreased red meat consumption (supplementary table A).
Mediterranean diet
A typical Mediterranean diet consists of consumption of 
high quantities of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, 
and olive oil, with low amounts of red meat (and a mod‑
erate amount of alcohol). Strong evidence from multiple 
randomized clinical trials (RCTs) shows that this dietary 
intervention has positive outcomes on inflammation and 
physical function among patients with existing rheu‑
matoid arthritis compared with a Western diet.111 112 In 
contrast, data derived from the Nurses’ Health Studies 
showed no significant association of a Mediterranean diet 
with the risk of women developing rheumatoid arthri‑
tis.113 However, this prospective analysis showed modest 
associations between increased legume intake and higher 
risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis and between 
long term moderate alcohol drinking and reduced risk of 
incident rheumatoid arthritis.114 These results have not 
always been confirmed, likely because individual foods/
nutrients confer only modest beneficial effects so any pro‑
tective effects would be observed only when several foods 
are consumed together.
A retrospective study using dietary pattern analysis 
based on the 2010 Alternative Healthy Eating Index has fur‑
ther demonstrated that a healthier diet was associated with 
reduced risk of rheumatoid arthritis occurring at 55 years 
of age or younger, particularly seropositive rheumatoid 
arthritis.115 Beneficial clinical results were also found to be 
associated with increased fatty acid intake but not with the 
concentration of circulating plasma antioxidants.116 How‑
ever, plasma concentrations of vitamin C, retinol, and uric 
acid (all antioxidants reportedly enriched in Mediterranean 
diets), were inversely correlated with rheumatoid arthritis 
disease activity.117 Noticeably, both vegetarian and Mediter‑
ranean diets have been linked to increased production of 
health promoting SCFAs,118 119 which prevent the activation 
of effector T cells and abrogate the manifestation of unde‑
sirable local and systemic inflammatory responses, mostly 
in animal models of autoimmune disease.100‑121 Although 
the mechanisms behind clinical amelioration of rheuma‑
toid arthritis secondary to Mediterranean‑type diets can 
logically be explained by perturbations in gut microbial 
ecology and associated SCFA driven immune modulation, 
this remains to be validated in humans.119

lioration of rheumatoid arthritis has also been exten‑

marked by sensitivity to dietary gluten.153‑155 Several 
studies suggest that psoriasis and celiac disease share 
common genetic and inflammatory pathways. A recent 
meta‑analysis of nine case‑control studies showed that 
psoriasis was associated with an increased frequency of 
celiac markers (odds ratio 2.36, 95% confidence interval 
1.15 to 4.83).156 Another systematic review and meta‑
analysis of observational studies reported an approxi‑
mately threefold increased risk of celiac disease among 
patients with cutaneous psoriasis.157 Moreover, several 
small studies have evaluated a possible therapeutic effect 
of a gluten‑free diet on severity of psoriasis, particularly 
in those patients with celiac antibodies.156 158
Summary of dietary studies
Noticeably, many of these dietary trials have been con‑
ducted using a variety of study designs (ranging from 
uncontrolled to randomized, double blind, placebo 
controlled), in different diseases and populations and 
with different timespans (days to months), dosage, and 
endpoints. It is therefore critical that future studies dis‑
sect the influence of each of these factors independently. 
Furthermore, it will be important to determine for how 
long the beneficial effects observed in some of these stud‑
ies persist after the dietary interventions are interrupted. 
Noticeably, none of the studies on rheumatoid arthritis 
or psoriatic disease has assessed how the microbiome 
fluctuates after the intervention. This is an important 
limitation, as it is unclear whether their beneficial effects 
are mediated by the microbiome or through some other 
alternative mechanism.
Probiotics and prebiotics in IBD and systemic autoimmune 
diseases
Probiotics and prebiotics in IBD
One of the first premises in microbiome research was 
that the intestinal microbiota could be positively modi‑
fied through the ingestion of probiotics containing living 
beneficial bacteria or prebiotics containing non‑digestible 
supplements that induce the growth (and/or activity) of 
commensal microorganisms. Although this has led to a 
growing and profitable market worldwide, the evidence 
behind health promoting properties of either strategy is 
still limited (supplementary table B).
Probiotics have been investigated for their theoretical 
potential to treat immune and inflammatory disorders. 
Because probiotics are taken orally, they must be able 
to resist passage through the acidic environment of the 
stomach. Moreover, as they do not colonize the gut per‑
manently, they must be taken indefinitely for any benefits 
to be maintained, which may limit their effectiveness.
Controversial evidence exists for a beneficial effect 
of probiotics in treating IBD.159 In Crohn’s disease, two 
open label studies using Lactobacillus rhamnosus and a 
combination of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spe‑
cies showed improved clinical disease activity index 
scores,160 161 although a placebo controlled trial did not 
find differences in time to relapse.162 A study of E coli 
Nissle 1917, a commonly used probiotic, did not find 
significant differences compared with placebo either.163 
Other meta‑analyses have also failed to find a benefit of 
Diet and obesity in psoriatic disease
Obesity
Obesity is considered to be a risk factor for cutaneous 
psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Multiple epidemiologic 
studies have shown an increased incidence of these disor‑
ders in people with elevated body mass index (>30).138‑140 
Simultaneously, several studies reported an obesity rate 
in cutaneous psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (around 
30%), significantly higher than the overall prevalence of 
obesity in the general population (15‑20%).141‑144
Obese patients with cutaneous psoriasis have more 
severe skin involvement compared with lean patients138; 
they also have a poor response to a variety of biologic 
therapies, most notably TNF inhibitors, and weight 
loss improves the response to treatment.145 Similarly, 
obese patients with psoriatic arthritis do not respond 
adequately to standard therapies (compared with lean 
patients) and have increased difficulty in achieving mini‑
mal disease activity, even when drugs are dosed accord‑
ing to weight.110 Intriguingly, dietary weight loss has been 
shown to facilitate response to treatment and improve 
clinical outcomes.110 146 Moreover, evidence suggests 
that dramatic weight loss (through bariatric surgery) can 
result in significant improvement in cutaneous psoriasis, 
including discontinuation of therapy in around 40% of 
patients.147
The reasons for a decreased response to biologic ther‑
apies in obese patients, and specifically to TNF inhibi‑
tors, are yet to be fully elucidated.148 However, obesity 
leads to increased production of inflammatory cytokines 
(most notably TNFα), and changes to related molecules 
such as leptin and adiponectin, which may contribute 
to the development of multiple disturbances in predis‑
posed people.149 150 Therefore, the “obesity of psoriatic 
disease” is regarded as a key link to the increased risk of 
comorbidities (diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and car‑
diovascular disease) that lead to further production of 
TNFα and related pro‑inflammatory mediators.151 This 
overproduction of TNFα, in turn, increases susceptibility 
to psoriatic disease activity and concomitantly decreases 
overall response to therapy. The total burden of TNFα in 
an obese psoriatic patient (that is, both from excess adi‑
pose tissue and from the psoriatic process itself) may far 
exceed the ability of TNF inhibitors to block the effects of 
the overall inflammatory response.
Dietary factors
Other specific dietary interventions have shown benefit 
in psoriatic patients. A recent meta‑analysis found that, 
of a variety of nutritional supplements reviewed, fish oil 
supplements resulted in the greatest clinical benefits 
compared with other supplements in RCTs. PASI scores 
decreased by 11.2 (SD 9.8) in the omega‑3 group versus 
7.5 (8.8) in the omega‑6 group (P=0.048).152 Although 
oral vitamin D showed promise in open label studies, lit‑
tle evidence of benefit was seen for selenium or B12 sup‑
plementation.
Several epidemiologic and clinical studies have also 
linked gluten intake with the pathogenesis of psoriasis, 
particularly because patients with cutaneous psoriasis 
have a higher prevalence of celiac disease, a condition

work on the role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis 
of spondyloarthritis (for example, HLA‑B27 transgenic 
rats and the SKG mouse model), only one study looked at 
63 patients with active spondyloarthritis and randomized 
them to either an oral probiotic consortium (Streptococ-
cus salivarius, Bifidobacterium lactis, and Lactobacillus 
acidophilus) or placebo for 12 weeks.182 Although no 
relevant adverse events were recorded, no significant 
differences were seen in any of the outcomes, including 
Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index or Bath 
Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index. Never‑
theless, evidence exists to support immunologic ben‑
efits in patients with severe ankylosing spondylitis who 
received Bacteroides fragilis.183 Similarly, one small RCT 
in patients with psoriasis showed improvement in inflam‑
matory responses but no positive clinical outcomes.184
Summary of probiotics and prebiotics
Overall, the accumulated evidence on the use of probi‑
otics and prebiotics in inflammatory conditions is not 
robust. As with other bacterially mediated therapies, part 
of the challenge stems from the disparity of study designs 
and criteria used to define health outcomes. Importantly, 
the lack of a well defined rationale for choosing specific 
prebiotics or probiotics also contributes to the challenges 
in the field. Studies that comprehensively examine the 
properties of different bacterial strains in vivo and char‑
acterize their beneficial or deleterious properties continue 
to be needed before additional clinical trials test their 
efficacy in treating inflammatory and immune disorders.
Fecal microbiota transplant
Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), or the transfer of 
intestinal microbiome from a healthy donor to a patient, 
has received considerable attention as a potential therapy 
for inflammatory disease given its astonishing success 
in the treatment (and even cure) of Clostridium difficile 
infection (CDI).185 This has been achieved both using 
filtered fecal material and with pills containing frozen 
biosamples.186‑188 FMT has also been used with some suc‑
cess in conditions such as metabolic syndrome.189 How‑
ever, the efficacy of FMT in IBD initially yielded mixed 
results. Pioneering studies in a small number of patients 
reported anecdotal reversal of symptoms.190 However, a 
non‑randomized study of single colonoscopic FMT in six 
patients with chronic active ulcerative colitis who were 
non‑responsive to standard therapy resulted in changes 
in microbial composition but no clinical remission.191 An 
RCT in 50 patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis 
found that 30% of participants receiving naso‑duodenal 
FMT from a healthy donor achieved the primary endpoint 
(clinical remission and 1 point decrease in Mayo endo‑
scopic score at week 12), compared with 20% in controls 
(autologous FMT).192 Although the differences were not 
statistically significant, the microbiome of responders 
after FMT showed features distinct from non‑responders, 
with higher similarity to donors. A second randomized 
study of 75 patients with mild to moderate ulcerative 
colitis receiving FMT or placebo (water) via enema ini‑
tially reported negative results, with the primary outcome 
defined as a Mayo score of 2 with an endoscopic Mayo 
probiotics in Crohn’s disease,164 165 suggesting that there 
is no strong evidence to date to support a beneficial role 
of probiotics in induction or maintenance of remission 
in Crohn’s disease.
Similarly, the evidence to date in ulcerative colitis is 
contradictory, with some studies showing a beneficial 
effect of probiotics such as VSL #3 or Bifidobacterium 
and Lactobacillus,166 167 whereas others fail to do so.168 169 
Meta‑analyses also seem to suggest no significant differ‑
ence between the use of probiotic and placebo for efficacy 
and safety.170
As an alternative to directly providing probiotics that 
generally do not engraft in the host, prebiotics are non‑
digestible substances aimed at stimulating the growth 
of certain beneficial bacteria. Prebiotics are thought to 
lower luminal pH through bacterial fermentation, promote 
barrier integrity, and down‑regulate pro‑inflammatory 
cytokines.171 Similar to probiotics, evidence for a benefi‑
cial effect of prebiotics in inflammatory disease is limited. 
In Crohn’s disease, there seems to be no clinical benefit (or 
any significant change in abundance of Bifidobacteria or F 
prausnitzii) when using fructo‑oligosaccharides.172 Lactu‑
lose also failed to improve clinical or endoscopic outcomes 
of ulcerative colitis activity.173 There is, however, some 
indication that oligofructose, when combined with inulin, 
could reduce levels of inflammation as measured by fecal 
calprotectin.174 Nevertheless, the efficacy of prebiotics can 
be partially mediated by chain length,175 176 with longer 
chains generally exerting a stronger prebiotic effect.177
Probiotics and prebiotics in rheumatoid arthritis and 
spondyloarthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis
Several studies have investigated the potential anti‑
inflammatory and clinical benefits of probiotics in 
rheumatoid arthritis, mostly relatively small RCTs. One 
such RCT found that in patients with chronic rheuma‑
toid arthritis on stable drug treatment, Lactobacillus 
casei significantly decreased disease activity score of 28 
joints (DAS28) compared with placebo and also altered 
the balance of cytokines in favor of an anti‑inflammatory 
response (increased interleukin 10 and decreased TNF 
and interleukin 6).178 These results are similar to that of a 
second RCT in which 30 patients received a consortium of 
probiotics (a daily capsule containing three viable strains: 
Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Bifido-
bacterium bifidum).179 In this case, eight weeks of probi‑
otic supplementation in addition to conventional disease 
modifying antirheumatic drugs resulted in improved 
DAS28 (−0.3 (SD) 0.4 v −0.1 (0.4); P=0.01) and decreased 
serum high sensitivity C‑reactive protein concentrations 
(−6.66 (2.56) v −3.07 (5.53) mg/mL; P<0.001) compared 
with placebo. A previous, small pilot study of administra‑
tion of L casei to patients with mild rheumatoid arthritis 
reported a similar effect.180 However, a third RCT found 
that administration of another Lactobacillus strain (L 
rhamnosus) was not efficacious after 52 weeks.181

define optimal donors. The Moayyedi trial anecdotally 
reported a single donor who induced remission in a sig‑
nificantly larger number of recipients compared with 
other donors. A recent study by Jacob et al also found 
that donor composition correlated with clinical response 
in 20 patients with ulcerative colitis.194 However, we still 
lack an understanding of the specific mechanisms behind 
these observations.
Finally, characteristics of the recipient need to be con‑
sidered when assessing the efficacy of FMT. Results from 
the Kump trial did not observe remission after FMT in 
patients with active ulcerative colitis.191 The Jacob study 
found that patients naive to biologics improved signifi‑
cantly compared with those previously exposed.194 The 
FOCUS study also reports higher pre‑FMT diversity in 
responders than in non‑responders.196 Future trials will 
be needed to investigate the relative efficacy of different 
donors (by using a fixed number of donors whose micro‑
biota is transplanted to different patients) to determine 
the extent to which response is driven by the donor’s 
microbiota, by the recipient’s pre‑FMT microbiota, or by 
other factors (such as level of engraftment).
Most studies of FMT have used whole microbial com‑
munities, from either single or pooled donors. Use of 
defined communities has clear benefits: simpler logis‑
tics, better manufacturing/quality control processes, 
and more clearly defined regulatory aspects, among oth‑
ers. Whether capsule based solutions are as effective as 
full FMT is unclear, however. As an example, CDI can be 
treated with bacterial pills, albeit with lower efficacy.186
The recently reported failure of the Seres trial has also 
cast some doubts on whether the success of CDI can 
be generalized to more complex diseases.197 We argue, 
however, that these results are confounded by multiple 
variables: which bacteria should be included, in what 
specific amounts, how to release them, and what the dos‑
ing should be. Future studies that look at some of these 
aspects are therefore needed to determine the feasibility 
of using defined bacterial communities.
Additionally, most studies have characterized the 
microbiome of patients post‑FMT for a limited period 
of time, generally up to eight weeks at most.196 Assess‑
ing the persistence of the transplanted microbiome in 
score of 0 at week 7. Surprisingly, the subsequent addi‑
tion of 22 participants receiving FMT from a single donor 
resulted in a positive study, with 24% of responders in the 
FMT group versus 5% in the placebo group.193
More recently, the FOCUS trial has reported a strong 
positive result in inducing clinical remission and endo‑
scopic response at eight weeks.193The study randomized 
81 patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis to 
either intensive treatment with FMT (pooled from mul‑
tiple donors) or placebo, with both groups receiving an 
initial colonoscopic infusion followed by enema (five days 
a week for the duration of the study). Intriguingly, 27% of 
the FMT treated patients had steroid‑free clinical remis‑
sion plus endoscopic remission or response, compared 
with only 8% of the patients given placebo (P=0.02), pro‑
viding further evidence for the efficacy of FMT in treating 
ulcerative colitis. A more recent prospective open label 
study of single FMT in 20 patients with active ulcera‑
tive colitis found increased bacterial diversity after FMT 
and clinical remission in 15% of the patients by week 
4.194 Interestingly, Mayo scores improved significantly in 
biologic‑naive patients compared with those previously 
exposed to biologics.
Although differences in study design (including pri‑
mary endpoint), dosing, FMT route, or donor specific 
effects could explain the variable outcomes in these tri‑
als,195 fundamental questions about the use of FMT in 
inflammatory disorders remain unanswered. Firstly, what 
represents a positive outcome needs to be standardized. 
This would not only ensure fair comparisons between dif‑
ferent trials but would also allow for meta‑analyses that 
could leverage larger sample sizes to increase power. Fur‑
thermore, most studies to date use colonoscopy/enema 
instead of naso‑duodenal administration. Although the 
Moayyedi and FOCUS trials suggest that the former might 
be the optimal route of administration,193 196 no study has 
specifically tried to answer this question in a comparative 
fashion.
Additionally, accurate dosing remains an untested 
variable, although the strong positive result of the FOCUS 
study again suggests that multiple FMTs might be nec‑
essary to achieve clinical and endoscopic remission. No 
established consensus exists as to what characteristics

biome altering properties.198 Because of the uncertainty 
about the best therapeutic strategy, multiple approaches 
are being tested with a broad spectrum ranging from 
community level interventions to highly specific targets 
(individual species/strains or bioactive metabolites; fig 
2). One conceptual method relies on the incorporation of 
live organisms (either single strains or bacterial consorti‑
ums) to shift the gut ecology, circumventing the necessity 
for FMT‑type approaches. This is mostly based on animal 
data showing preclinical efficacy in IBD models after the 
inoculation of Bacteroides fragilis or a cocktail of multiple 
strains of Clostridia.2 199
A second, more refined, approach focuses on taking 
advantage of previously described, bacterial derived, 
immunoregulatory molecules, such as polysaccharides, 
structural proteins, and SCFAs. Despite encouraging 
preclinical results, this is still a nascent field in which 
the effectiveness, toxicity profile, and long term effects 
of these microbiota derived molecules all remain to be 
studied in depth. As the potential benefits of these non‑
classic immunomodulators continue to be elucidated, a 
variety of biotechnology companies continue to invest in 
these therapeutic tools (table 2). However, several scien‑
tific and legal hurdles will need to be overcome before the 
gut microbiome can be successfully made “druggable.” As 
with FMT, several aspects of these technologies need fur‑
ther research, including understanding precise d 
elivery 
patients for prolonged periods of time will be important 
to determine how often FMT might be needed to maintain 
remission. Furthermore, FMT studies generally measure 
clinical response, but there is no comprehensive immu‑
nologic characterization of the patients after transplant, 
with the notable exception of the Jacob study.194 Given 
the known relation between altered microbial compo‑
sition and immune phenotypes, understanding how 
engraftment of specific microbiotas induces differenti‑
ated immune responses will be critical to gain further 
insights on mechanisms of action and, potentially, on 
how to improve FMT to treat inflammatory and immune 
conditions.
Emerging treatments for IBD and autoimmune disease

of many research groups and drug companies that have

clinical outcomes of systemic autoimmune disease?
• Is there a “window of opportunity” for intervention to alter 
the intestinal microbiome to prevent or delay the onset of 
systemic inflammatory disease?
• What are the potential unanticipated health effects of 
modifying the intestinal microbial community, such as the 
ability to respond to specific pathogens? 
• Further understanding the interaction of non-bacterial 
communities (eg, fungal, viral) with the host intestinal 
bacteria and immune system
• What are the effects of the intestinal microbiota on 
immunomodulatory drug metabolism and therapeutic 
outcomes?

Conclusion
The effects of dietary interventions in health and disease 
has been appreciated and studied since ancient times. 
Recently, there has been an explosion of data character‑
izing the complex interaction between foods, microbes, 
and derived metabolites (and combinations of these) 
with local intestinal and systemic immune responses. 
This work has been supported by the advent of a true 
technological revolution in microbiomics and associated 
disciplines, as well as paradigm shifting work by many 
groups in understanding mucosal immunology. As we 
dramatically enhance our basic physiologic knowledge 
of the biologic consequences of diet in the composition 
of gut bacterial ecology and associated bioactive metab‑
olites, the clinical sciences are pursuing, albeit slowly, 
effective interventions that can modulate dysbiosis and its 
consequences in infectious and inflammatory disorders. 
More robust, well designed clinical trials coupled with 
detailed mechanistic work will be needed to accurately 
intervene for the treatment and perhaps even prevention 
of autoimmune diseases.
