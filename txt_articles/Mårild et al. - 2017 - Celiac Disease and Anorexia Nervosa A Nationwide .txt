BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Previous research suggests an association of celiac disease (CD) with 
anorexia nervosa (AN), but data are mostly limited to case reports. We aimed to determine 
whether CD is associated with the diagnosis of AN.
METHODS: Register-based cohort and case-control study including women with CD (n = 
17 959) and sex- and age-matched population-based controls (n = 89 379). CD (villous 
atrophy) was identified through the histopathology records of Sweden’s 28 pathology 
departments. Inpatient and hospital-based outpatient records were used to identify AN. 
Hazard ratios for incident AN diagnosis were estimated by using stratified Cox regression 
with CD diagnosis as a time-dependent exposure variable. In the secondary analyses, we 
used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios for being diagnosed with AN 
before CD.
RESULTS: Median age of CD diagnosis was 28 years. During 1 174 401 person-years of 
follow-up, 54 patients with CD were diagnosed with AN (27/100 000 person-years) 
compared with 180 matched controls (18/100 000 person-years). The hazard ratio for later 
AN was 1.46 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08–1.98) and 1.31 beyond the first year after 
CD diagnosis (95% CI, 0.95–1.81). A previous AN diagnosis was also associated with CD 
(odds ratio, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.45–3.29). Estimates remained largely unchanged when adjusted 
for socioeconomic characteristics and type 1 diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: The bidirectional association between AN diagnosis and CD warrants attention 
in the initial assessment and follow-up of these conditions because underdiagnosis and 
misdiagnosis of these disorders likely cause protracted and unnecessary morbidity.

WhaT’s KnOWn On ThIs subjecT: Case reports 
suggest an association of celiac disease with 
anorexia nervosa, but there are few large-scale 
studies. This is additionally complicated by the 
clinical similarities between the illnesses that may 
lead to misclassification, delay in diagnosis, and 
improper treatment.
WhaT ThIs sTuDy aDDs: This study of some 18 000 
women with celiac disease (CD) showed a positive 
association between CD and anorexia nervosa both 
before and after CD diagnosis. This bidirectional 
association warrants attention in the initial medical 
assessment and follow-up of these conditions.

Celiac disease (CD) is an 
inflammatory disorder in which 
gluten ingestion causes small-
intestinal villous atrophy; the 
treatment consists of a lifelong strict 
adherence to a gluten-free diet.1 
The disease occurs in 1% to 2% 
of the Western population2 and is 
more prevalent in women. Common 
presenting symptoms include 
gastrointestinal complaints, loss of 
appetite, fatigue, and, in children, 
stunted growth and pubertal 
delay.3 There are also numerous 
extraintestinal manifestations of CD, 
including psychiatric comorbidity.4
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an 
eating disorder associated with 
underweight, fear of weight gain, and 
disturbance in the way in which one’s 
body weight or shape is experienced, 
undue influence of body weight on 
self-evaluation, or persistent lack of 
recognition of the seriousness of the 
low weight.5 The disorder typically 
affects girls during adolescence and 
young adulthood and is associated 
with elevated psychiatric and somatic 
morbidity and mortality.6 Diseases 
with dietary constraints, such as food 
allergy and type 1 diabetes, 
7, 
 
8  
have been associated with AN. It is 
conceivable that a restrictive diet, 
in susceptible individuals, may 
trigger obsessive eating patterns; 
for others, the diet may cause a 
prolonged negative energy balance 
that could be the tipping point for 
developing AN.9 Previous research 
has indicated that AN may be linked 
to CD, but data have mostly been 
limited to case reports.10 
– 
16 The only 
earlier population-based study in 
this field found CD to be associated 
with a significant two-to-threefold 
increased diagnosis of AN and vice 
versa.17 However, that study was 
restricted to patients requiring 
hospital admission for CD and may 
therefore have included patients with 
a high degree of comorbidity, which 
may have caused exaggerated risk 
estimates.
The primary aim of this nationwide 
study was to test the hypothesis 
that individuals with biopsy-
verified CD were at increased risk 
of AN before or after CD diagnosis. 
Our secondary aim was to examine 
if any observed association with AN 
diagnosis was specific to CD  
or also present in patients 
with milder small-intestinal 
histopathology. We therefore 
examined the association of 
diagnosed AN also among biopsied 
individuals without CD.
MeThODs
Using the personal identity number18 
assigned to all Swedish residents, 
we linked histopathology data 
on individuals undergoing small-
intestinal biopsy to the National 
Patient Register19 to determine their 
risk for AN diagnosis compared with 
population-based matched controls.
study sample
Individuals with CD, defined as the 
presence of small-intestinal villous 
atrophy (Marsh grade III), 
20 were 
identified by using the computerized 
histopathology records of Sweden’s 
28 pathology departments; an 
earlier evaluation has shown that 
95% of Swedish individuals with 
villous atrophy have a clinical CD 
diagnosis.21 The time of diagnosis 
was defined as the time of small-
intestinal biopsy, ranging from 1969 
to 2008.18
We also identified individuals 
undergoing biopsy showing small-
intestinal inflammation (Marsh grade 
I–II) or normal mucosa (Marsh grade 
0) but with a positive CD serology 
test (antigliadin, antiendomysial, or 
transglutaminase antibodies).22 Data 
on CD serology originated from 8 
university hospitals providing care 
for approximately half of the Swedish 
population.22
By using the same dataset as 
previously reported, 
23 this study 
restricted participation to women 
living in Sweden in 1987 and later: 
17 959 with CD, 7455 with small-
intestinal inflammation, and 2307 
women with normal small-intestinal 
mucosa, but positive CD serology. 
Through the government agency 
Statistics Sweden, each individual 
undergoing biopsy was matched by 
sex, age, calendar period of birth, 
and county of residence with up to 5 
controls from the general population 
(n = 137 818) (Fig 1). Our main 
analyses were restricted to women 
to eliminate wrongful AN diagnoses 
in men.
anorexia nervosa
Diagnosis of AN was defined24, 
 
25 by 
any of the following International 
Classification of Diseases, Eighth 
Revision (ICD-8), International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision (ICD-9), and International 
Classification of Diseases, Tenth 
Revision (ICD-10) codes recorded 
in the National Patient Register: 
ICD-8, 306.50; ICD-9, 307B; ICD-
10, F50.0 and F50.1. To eliminate 
diagnostic misclassification from 
eating-related disorders of young 
children, we restricted AN to 
diagnoses recorded at age 6 years or 
later.26 The National Patient Register 
started in 1964, became nationwide 
in 1987, and includes hospital-based 
outpatient care since 2001.19 The 
date of diagnosis was determined 
by the first appearance of an AN 
diagnosis.
covariates
We obtained data from Statistics 
Sweden on the highest attained 
education level and socioeconomic 
status until the end of 2009; for 
children, we used the highest 
category attained by their parents. 
Socioeconomic status was defined 
by occupational status according 
to the European Socioeconomic 
Classification system.27 We also 
retrieved information on type 1 
diabetes diagnosis as recorded in 
the National Patient Register by age 
2

30 years (ICD-8/ICD-9, 250; ICD-10, 
E10). We used an age cutoff because 
ICD-8 and ICD-9 do not distinguish 
between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. 
Covariates are categorized as shown 
in Table 1.
statistical analyses
The associations of the diagnosis  
of AN were estimated by using  
Cox regression and logistic 
regression models for matched  
data.
Cox Regression: Subsequent Diagnosis 
of AN After CD
We used stratified Cox proportional-
hazards regression, with age in 
days as the time metric, to estimate 
hazard ratios (HRs) for incident 
diagnosis of AN with associated 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs). The HRs 
were modeled separately within 
each stratum consisting of 1 woman 
undergoing biopsy and up to 5 
matched controls; this stratumwise 
analysis eliminates the effect of the 
matching variables (ie, age, sex, 
calendar period of birth, and county 
of residence). Individuals were 
followed from January 1, 1987, or 
birth for children born thereafter, 
until AN diagnosis, emigration, death, 
or December 31, 2009, whichever 
occurred first. The follow-up started 
in 1987, when the National Patient 
Register became nationwide, for 
all participants at risk for AN. We 
excluded 73 individuals diagnosed 
with AN before 1987 (start of 
follow-up) and 319 with a record

of AN before undergoing biopsy (or 
corresponding date among controls). 
Hence, the Cox regression analyses 
included 17 924 individuals with 
CD, 7425 with inflammation, 2294 
with normal mucosa but positive 
CD serology, and 137 504 matched 
controls.
The proportional-hazards 
assumption was found to be valid 
based on graphical presentation of 
the data. The time of biopsy (and 
corresponding date for matched 
controls) was included as a time-
dependent variable; individuals 
with CD, inflammation, or normal 
mucosa but positive CD serology 
were defined as exposed from time 
of biopsy and thereafter considered 
exposed throughout follow-up. 
Individuals biopsied before 
January 1, 1987 were considered 
to be exposed from the start of the 
follow-up period. Hazard ratios 
were adjusted for education level, 
socioeconomic status, and type 1 
diabetes.
For individuals with CD and their 
controls, we conducted separate 
analyses for children (age ≤19 years) 
and adults and by calendar period 
of biopsy (≤1994 and ≥1995). The 
HR for AN beyond the first year 
of CD diagnosis was modeled by 
introducing a 1-year lag time during 
which an individual was considered 
unexposed until 1 year after 
diagnosis and exposed thereafter. 
To test the ascertainment of AN, 
we performed a separate analysis 
restricted to AN listed as the main 
diagnosis in the National Patient 
Register.
Logistic Regression: Diagnosis of AN 
Before CD
We used conditional logistic 
regression to estimate odds ratios 
(ORs) for previous diagnosis of 
AN among individuals undergoing 
biopsy compared with their 
matched controls.28 Analyses 
were performed stratumwise and 
therefore conditioned on age, sex, 
calendar period of birth, and county 
of residence. In parallel with the 
above, we performed adjusted 
analyses, accounting for education 
level, socioeconomic status, and type 
1 diabetes. In individuals with CD 
and their controls, we also performed 
analyses stratified by age and 
calendar year of birth.
In a post hoc analysis, we also 
examined AN and CD in men (CD,  
n = 11 025; controls, n = 54 774).
Statistical significance was defined 
as 95% CIs for HRs and ORs not 
including 1.00. Data were analyzed 
by using Stata version 14 (Stata Corp, 
College Station, TX).
ethics
This study was approved by the 
Regional Ethical Vetting Board in 
Stockholm, Sweden, which deemed 
that individual informed consent 
was not required.29 Data used in this 
study were deidentified.
ResuLTs
Among the 17 959 women with CD 
in this study, the median age at CD 
diagnosis was 28 years (interquartile 
range, 6–52 years) (see Table 1 for 
population characteristics). There 
were 353 individuals diagnosed 
with AN at a median age of 17 years 
(interquartile range, 15–22 years).
cD and Future an Diagnosis
From 1987 through 2009, during 
1 174 401 person-years of follow-up, 
54 patients with CD were diagnosed 
with AN compared with 180 
matched controls. The incidence 
rate for AN after a CD diagnosis was 
27/100 000 person-years (95% CI, 
21–36) compared with 18/100 000 
person-years (95% CI, 16–21) among 
matched controls; this corresponded 
to an HR for AN diagnosis of 1.46 
(95% CI, 1.08–1.98). Adjustments 
for education level, socioeconomic 
status, and type 1 diabetes yielded 
a largely unchanged HR (Fig 2). 
Analyses stratified by age at CD 
diagnosis and by calendar period of 
biopsy are presented in Fig 2. Among 
women with a main diagnosis of AN 
in the National Patient Register, the 
HR was 1.34 (95% CI, 0.97–1.86).
Diagnosis of an before cD
A total of 33 individuals with CD 
(0.18%) and 76 matched controls 
(0.09%) had a record of AN before 
CD diagnosis (and corresponding 
date among controls); the OR for 
a previous diagnosis of AN was 
2.18 (95% CI, 1.45–3.29) among 
individuals diagnosed with CD 
compared with controls. There 
were significantly increased ORs 
for a previous history of AN when 
stratifying by age at CD diagnosis  
and calendar period of diagnosis  
(Fig 3). When restricting our analysis 
to those with AN listed as the main 
diagnosis in the National Patient 
Register, the OR was 2.13 (95% CI, 
1.37–3.32).
an in biopsied Patients Without cD
In secondary analyses, we tested 
the association of AN with (1) small-
intestinal inflammation without 
villous atrophy and (2) normal 
small-intestinal mucosa, but with 
positive CD serology. Both groups 
had a significantly increased risk 
for diagnosis of AN before as well as 
after the time of biopsy compared 
with matched controls (Tables 2  
and 3).
Post hoc analysis: an and cD in Men
There was no significantly increased 
risk for subsequent AN among males 
with CD (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.21–4.32). 
This HR was based on 12 men being 
diagnosed with AN. Nor did we find 
a significantly increased OR for 
previous AN among men with CD 
(OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 0.63–10.00).
DIscussIOn
This nationwide study found a 
positive association between CD 
and AN both before and after

CD diagnosis. This bidirectional 
association should encourage 
physicians to closely monitor  
these patients and calls for 
heightened understanding of 
factors that contribute to their 
cooccurrence.
Potential Mechanisms of action
We propose that a number of factors 
may contribute to this bidirectional 
association.
First, on initial examination, 
individuals with underlying CD or 
AN may be misdiagnosed with the 
other condition. In patients who 
receive an initial erroneous CD 
diagnosis, it should soon become 
evident that the gluten-free diet 
is not effective and additional 
evaluation would reveal the eating 
disorder. In patients who receive 
an initial erroneous diagnosis of 
AN and who present with ongoing 
symptoms of fatigue and abdominal 
complaints, additional workups 
should be initiated to rule out CD 
or other gastrointestinal illnesses. 
Such persistent symptoms should be 
followed up because untreated CD 
leads to complications and a poorer 
quality of life.4
Second, we cannot rule out that our 
results have been influenced by 
surveillance bias. Before and after 
the time of diagnosis, individuals 
with either CD or AN are typically 
more extensively investigated 
for other diseases compared 
with individuals in the general 
population. For example, diarrhea 
due to laxative misuse in AN as 
well as liver enzyme abnormalities 
can both lead to a work-up for CD. 
The positive associations found 
between AN and small-intestinal 
inflammation but no villous  
atrophy and with having a biopsy 
with normal mucosa but positive 
CD serology strongly indicate that 
surveillance bias at least partly  
plays a role here because, in  
Sweden, a gluten-free diet is not 
typically recommended for these 
conditions.
Third, shared risk factors, including 
genetic susceptibility, may play 
a role.30 Recent genomewide 
association studies of AN have 
indicated genetic regions shared

with other population-based  
data,

31 these results encourage

relationship between AN and

diseases.
clinical Relevance
The positive association of CD 
with AN, both before and after CD 
diagnosis, should spur a careful initial 
assessment and follow-up of these 
illnesses. It should also be appreciated 
that the 2 conditions can complicate 
each other. Having AN makes it 
harder to follow a gluten-free diet, 
and it cannot be excluded that some 
AN patients knowingly consume 
gluten-containing products to lose 
weight.11 The treatment of AN and 
CD require different competences 
and a multidisciplinary approach to 
management is important.
Although the vast majority of AN 
occurs in women, this disease can 
also occur in men. Although we

found no significant association 
between AN and CD in men, this 
does not mean that the risk of CD is 
different in women and men with 
AN. Our male-restricted analysis had 
low statistical power, and we urge 
caution when interpreting those 
findings.
comparison With earlier Literature
Research on CD and AN almost 
exclusively consists of case-series.10 
– 
15 
The largest case series so far was 
published by Leffler et al11 in 2007 
and included 10 female patients with 
CD and eating disorders. All patients 
in this study were first diagnosed with 
AN or bulimia nervosa and only later 
with CD. Only 1 previous study by 
Basso et al16 specifically screened for 
CD in patients with AN; 1 out of 177 
(0.6%) screened patients with AN had 
biopsy-verified CD, but this study was 
unable to calculate any relative risk 
estimates because it had no control 
group, nor did the investigators 
examine the temporality between CD 
and AN.
Recently, however, an English 
register-based study, including 
hospitalized AN patients, found a 
significant threefold increased risk 
of later CD diagnosis and a twofold 
risk increase for AN in CD patients.17 
Although that study identified patients 
requiring hospital admission for 
CD, our study includes both in- and 
outpatients with CD. This distinction 
may be important because inpatient 
registers are often limited to patients 
with more severe CD and more 
susceptible to surveillance bias, which 
could overinflate risk estimates.
strengths and Limitations
The main strength of our paper is 
the population-based approach 
with almost 18 000 CD patients. 
The large numbers allowed us to 
examine subsets of patents with CD 
stratified by age and calendar period 
of diagnosis.
We used small-intestinal biopsy 
reports with villous atrophy to 
identify individuals with CD. 
Throughout the study period, 
biopsy was the gold standard 
for CD diagnosis, and >96% of 
Swedish pediatric and adult 
gastroenterologists performed 
a biopsy before assigning a CD 
diagnosis.21 Non-celiac causes for 
villous atrophy are uncommon in 
Sweden, and when we examined 
114 randomly selected charts of 
patients with villous atrophy, 108 
(95%) had CD.21 In a subset of 
patients with available data at the 
time of CD diagnosis, 88% were 
positive for either transglutaminase, 
endomysium, or antigliadin 
antibodies. Of note, a large 
proportion of patients in our sample 
were diagnosed when gliadin was the 
only available antibody and before 
transglutaminase and endomysium 
antibodies were readily available in 
the clinic.
Although we are unaware of any 
validation of AN as registered in the 
National Patient Register (and we did 
not have access to medical records to 
verify the AN diagnoses), the overall 
validity of this register is high with 
85% to 95% of diagnoses being 
correct.19 To increase the specificity 
of the AN diagnosis, we carried out 
a sensitivity analysis restricting our 
outcome to individuals with AN listed 
as the main diagnosis. This analysis 
also showed a positive association, 
although the HR was somewhat 
lower (1.34 vs 1.46 for our main 
analysis) and was not statistically 
significant.
This study has some limitations. We 
did not screen for undiagnosed CD 
or subthreshold AN. It is therefore 
likely that some individuals with 
long-standing eating disturbances 
were first screened for CD, and 
then subsequently diagnosed with 
AN only when the gluten-free diet 
did not help. A related limitation 
is our lack of clinical data on 
symptoms or signs that would 
enable us to differentiate between 
subtypes of AN or differences in CD 
presentation. Moreover, in patients 
with an initial diagnosis of AN 
followed by a subsequent diagnosis 
of CD, it is also possible that the 
AN diagnosis may represent a 
misdiagnosis of CD.  
In our earlier validation study of  
CD, 
21 1 in 3 patients with CD 
suffered from weight loss or growth 
failure, which are symptoms 
resembling AN. It is not likely 
that the association is due to 
gastrointestinal changes in AN 
patients being misinterpreted as CD 
on biopsy. Not even AN with severe 
underweight has demonstrated 
mucosal atrophy.10, 
 
32
In addition, data on ethnicity and diet 
were lacking. The latter prevented 
us from studying whether strict 
adherence to a gluten-free diet 
mediated the association with AN. 
As part of an earlier validation study 
of our cohort, 71 out of 86 (83%) 
randomly selected patients with CD 
revealed dietary adherence according

to patient chart data.21 Hence, we 
cannot isolate a restricted diet as 
the mechanism underlying the 
association between CD and later AN; 
however, given the high adherence to 
gluten-free diets, we speculate that 
dietary restrictions may trigger AN in 
susceptible individuals.
Finally, we cannot rule out that 
residual confounding factors may 
have influenced our results, although 
we accounted for important potential 
confounders, such as age, birth year, 
country of residence, education, 
socioeconomic status, and type 1 
diabetes.

The bidirectional association 
between diagnosis of AN and CD 
warrants attention in the initial 
assessment and the follow-up  
of women with these illnesses. 
This is important because the 
presentation of these conditions 
may mimic each other and the 
misdiagnosis of either disorder 
likely causes protracted and 
unnecessary morbidity.
