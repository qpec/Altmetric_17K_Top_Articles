Retention of the ability to wake from sleep in response to dangerous situations is an
ideal characteristic of safe hypnotics. We studied the effects of a dual orexin receptor
antagonist-22 (DORA-22) and the GABA-A receptor modulator, triazolam, on the ability
to wake in response to aversive stimuli. We examined four modalities of sensory inputs,
namely, auditory (ultrasonic sound), vestibular (trembling), olfactory (predator odor),
and autonomic (hypoxia) stimuli. When the mice fell asleep, one of the four stimuli
was applied for 30 s. In the case of auditory stimulation, latency to arousal following
vehicle, DORA-22, and triazolam administration was 3.0 (2.0–3.8), 3.5 (2.0–6.5), and
161 (117–267) s (median and 25–75 percentile in the parentheses, n = 8), respectively.
Latency to return to sleep after arousal was 148 (95–183), 70 (43–98), and 60 (52–69)
s, respectively. Similar results were obtained for vestibular and olfactory stimulation.
During the hypoxic stimulation, latencies for arousal and returning to sleep were not
significantly different among the groups. The findings of this study are consistent with the
distinct mechanisms of these sleep promoting therapies; GABA-A receptor activation by
triazolam is thought to induce widespread central nervous system (CNS) suppression
while DORA-22 more specifically targets sleep/wake pathways through orexin receptor
antagonism. These data support the notion that DORA-22 preserves the ability to
wake in response to aversive and consciousness-inducing sensory stimuli, regardless
of modality, while remaining effective in the absence of threat. This study provides a
unique and important safety evaluation of the potential for certain hypnotics.

INTRODUCTION
Although living in the modern world allows us to encounter dangerous situations far less frequently
than what wild animals may encounter, it is still important for humans to be able to awaken quickly
during natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic explosions, and fires. Stress and anxiety
resulting from worrying about sleeping through these occurrences may lead to conditions such
as insomnia.
Even during sleep, the brain continuously processes sensory information. This has been
demonstrated by brainstem auditory evoked potential recordings (Perrin et al., 1999) and
neuroimaging (Portas et al., 2000). The threshold required for the sensory input to reach

the cerebral cortex, however, is higher during sleep than when
awake due to thalamic sensory gating (McCormick and Bal,
1994). Central nervous system (CNS) depressants, such as
benzodiazepines, also affect the threshold required in order
for sensory input to evoke arousal. For example, the short-
acting benzodiazepine triazolam impaired the ability in sleeping
humans to wake up upon exposure to a loud fire alarm (Johnson
et al., 1987).
The orexin/hypocretin-signaling pathway was discovered in
1998 (de Lecea et al., 1998; Sakurai et al., 1998) and plays an
important role in regulating arousal and sleep (Sakurai, 2007) as
well as vigilance state-dependent changes in autonomic functions
(Kuwaki, 2015; Carrive and Kuwaki, 2016). Dual orexin receptor
antagonists (DORAs) that block orexin receptors 1 and 2 have
recently been developed and promote sleep through a decrease
in arousal signaling (Gotter et al., 2014). GABA-A modulators,
the most widely used hypnotic (Roehrs and Roth, 2000; Wang
and Liu, 2016), and DORAs have different sleep promoting
mechanisms, so it stands to reason that their effect on sensory-
input induced arousal may also be different.
Tannenbaum et al. (2014) previously showed that one of
the DORAs, DORA-22, did not impair the ability to wake in
response to emotionally salient acoustic stimuli in dogs. In their
study, the authors used an acoustic tone classically conditioned
to be associated with a food reward. In almost all of the trials,
DORA-22-treated dogs woke up in response to the salient
positive stimulus but not to the neutral stimulus in a similar way
to when they received no drug. The same group of authors later
showed similar results with monkeys (Tannenbaum et al., 2016).
Unfortunately, however, the authors mentioned only tested
positive but not negative emotion-associated stimulus. Another
weak point of their studies was that they used cue-conditioned
test paradigm but not innate salient stimuli. Therefore, possible
effect of DORA-22 on sensory processing circuit is still an
open question even though it may not affect memory retrieval
process.
The purpose of the present study was to examine the possible
effects of a DORA-22, on negative valence stimuli-induced
arousal which is independent from learning and memory, and
compare them with GABA-A receptor modulators, eszopiclone
and triazolam. We also analyzed the latency to return to sleep
after the stimuli ceased in order to evaluate any possible retention
of sleep promoting effects from the drugs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Experiments were conducted on male C57BL/6 mice (25–35 g,
Clea Japan). Animals were maintained under normal laboratory
conditions
(controlled
23◦C
temperature
and
food/water
ad libitum) under a regular 12-h light/dark cycle (19:00 lights off
and 07:00 lights on). All experiments were performed during the
dark phase when nocturnal mice are most active. Experiments
were performed in accordance with the guidelines outlined by
the Physiological Society of Japan (2015) and were approved by
the Experimental Animal Research Committee of Kagoshima
University (MD16051).
Compounds
All pharmacological agents were diluted in 20% d-alpha
tocopherol
polyethylene
glycol
1,000
succinate
(Vitamin
E-TPGS) vehicle to a dose volume of 0.1 ml/10 g, and were
administered orally using standard stainless steel gavage needles
affixed to a 1 ml syringe (p.o.). Hypnotics tested included a
DORA-22 (100 mg/kg; Gotter et al., 2014; a kind gift from Merck
& Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA), triazolam (1.25 mg/kg; Sigma-
Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO, USA), and eszopiclone
(15 mg/kg; Carbosynth Ltd., Compton, Berkshire, UK). Doses
were determined according to previously published articles
(Gotter et al., 2014) and clinical dosage information for humans
(10 mg for suvorexant, a derivative of DORA-22, 0.125 mg for
triazolam, and 1 mg for eszopiclone).
All mice received treatment with all drugs/vehicle in
randomized order. An interval between administrations of
at least 3 days was used according to the previous article
(Winrow et al., 2012) to prevent any possible influences of
repeated procedures and residual drug effects. Half-life off-rate
of DORA-22 to orexin 2 receptor binding was reported to be
37.8 min (Gotter et al., 2013) and no next-day effects was
reported at least in monkeys (Gotter et al., 2013).
Sleep Recordings
Under isoflurane (1.5%–2.0%, inhalation through face mask)
anesthesia, electrodes were implanted for EEG/EMG recording.
Two holes were drilled in the skull, and the arms of the
electrode for the EEG were implanted at sites approximately
1.5 mm lateral to the Bregma. EMG recording wires made
of stainless steel (Cooner Wire, Chatsworth, CA, USA) were
inserted into the neck muscles bilaterally. Each electrode was
fixed rigidly to the skull with dental cement. After surgery,
mice were given an antibiotic, penicillin G (40,000 U kg−1),
and an analgesic (buprenorphine, 0.05 mg kg−1). Animals were
individually housed and allowed to recover for at least 7 days.
The implanted electrode of each mouse was connected to a
cable for signal output. Signals were amplified (AVH-11, Nihon
Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) and digitally recorded on a computer
with signal processing software (Chart, ADInstruments Inc.,
Bella Vista, NSW, Australia). Sleep stages were judged according
to the method previously published (Nakamura et al., 2003). In
brief, wakefulness was defined by a high frequency (8–30 Hz)
low-amplitude EEG with a high EMG tone. Slow wave
sleep (SWS) was defined by a low-frequency (0.25–4 Hz)
high-amplitude EEG. Non-SWS sleep or rapid eye movement
(REM) sleep was defined by a mixed-frequency (4–8 and
8–30 Hz) low amplitude EEG associated with weak or absent
EMG activity.

begins. After 1 h of baseline measurement, either vehicle,
DORA-22, triazolam, or eszopiclone was orally administered
to the mice. Mice eventually received all four drugs in a
random order. The sleep-wake rhythm was measured until
02:00 (6 h after administration). Night dosing was selected
because in nocturnal mice the baseline time spent sleeping is
smaller than it is in daytime and thus any sleep-promoting
effects are easier to observe. Sleep time was calculated for every
30 min. Mice’s natural sleep is not continuous as humans but
relatively short repetition of sleep and wake. Therefore, we
thought that latency to arousal by aversive stimuli and latency
to return to sleep should be evaluated in comparison with
natural sleep/awake duration. For this purpose, we calculated
episode duration of sleep and awake in this (without stimulation)
experiment.
Aversive Stimuli-Induced Arousal Testing
Stimulation experiments were conducted between 21:00 and
24:00,
which
correspond

drug
administration, in the different sets of the animals to the
above-stated without stimulation group. When the mouse fell
asleep for more than 1 min and in SWS, one of the stimuli (see
below) was applied and any possible effects of the stimulus on the
sleep-wake cycle were observed for 30 min. The same stimulus
was applied 2–3 times in one animal during the experimental
period of 3 h and the average value was used as the representative
value for the experiment. Only one type of stimulus was tested
over the course of one experimental night.
The following four aversive stimuli were tested using different
set of the animals. First, for auditory stimulation, ultrasonic
sound (25 kHz, 100 dB, 0.5 s × 7 times, interval 4.5 s; Moriya
et al., 2018) was applied from a position 20 cm above the sleeping
mouse (n = 8). Ultrasonic sound was generated by PET-AGREE
(apparatus used for training pets; K2 Enterprises, NY, USA).
Second, for vestibular stimulation, trembling (180 rpm) was
applied to a measuring cage containing a mouse (n = 8) for
30 s. Trembling was done by a shaker (mini-shaker PSU-2T;
WakenBtech, Kyoto, Japan) on which the measuring cage was
placed. Third, for olfactory stimulation, a cotton swab containing
10 µL of TMT (2,4,5-trimethyl-3-thiazoline, a predator odor
which is extracted from fox feces) was placed at the distance of
1 cm from the tip of the mouse’s nose (n = 10) for 30 s (Tashiro
et al., 2016). Fourth, for hypoxic stimulation, 10% O2 gas
(1,000 ml/min) was introduced into a gas tight chamber (750 ml)
in which the mouse (n = 8) was placed. Oxygen concentration
in the chamber was monitored (model JKO-25LJ II CM, JIKCO,
Tokyo, Japan) at the output port. Oxygen concentration in the
chamber became 10% within 120 s, was maintained there for
180 s, and then returned to the normal room air concentration
(21% O2).
For the sleep state analysis, we calculated the latency to wake
up from the aversive stimulus and latency to return to sleep after

after receiving vehicle, DORA-22, and triazolam.
Statistical Analysis
In the test for the sleep promoting effects of the hypnotics, data
were expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical comparisons were
performed using repeated measure ANOVA followed by Tukey’s
multiple comparisons test. In the stimuli-induced arousal
testing, data were expressed as median and 25–75 percentile
because data were not normally distributed (see ‘‘Results’’
section) and non-parametric statistics were more suitable.
Statistical comparisons were performed using the Friedman test,
a repeated measure nonparametric multiple comparisons test.
When appropriate, it was followed by Dunn’s post hoc test. All
statistics were calculated using Prism6 software (GraphPad

RESULTS
Sleep Time Without Aversive Stimuli
Before
the
aversive
stimuli-experiments,
the
length
and
magnitude of any sleep-promoting effects from the various
hypnotics were tested in our experimental setting without any
stimulation (Figure 1). During the 6 h of the observation period,
mice spent 160 ± 11 min, 221 ± 6 min, 210 ± 13 min, and
209 ± 7 min sleeping (SWS and REM sleep) under the effects of
either vehicle, DORA-22, triazolam, or eszopiclone, respectively.
Although all three drugs seemingly had a sleep promoting effect,
the detailed characteristics were different. As to SWS duration,
DORA-22 (206 ± 5 min, p = 0.006, n = 5, Tukey’s multiple
comparison test) and triazolam (209 ± 13 min, p = 0.016)
significantly increased and eszopiclone (205 ± 7 min, p = 0.057)
tended to increase as compared to vehicle (154 ± 10 min).
While on REM sleep, DORA-22 (15.3 ± 1.7 min, p = 0.033)
significantly increased, triazolam (1.5 ± 0.2 min, p = 0.089)
tended to decrease, and eszopiclone (3.9 ± 0.7 min, p = 0.784)
showed no effect as compared to vehicle (5.1 ± 0.9 min). In
addition, effect of eszopiclone appeared to have a later onset
than DORA-22 and triazolam (compare Figures 1A–C). Since
the main purpose of this study was to compare aversive stimuli-
evoked responses among the hypnotics, we thought similar
magnitude and similar time course of sleep-promoting effect
of hypnotics would be desirable. From this consideration, we
selected the 3 h starting from 1 h after the injection until 4 h
after the injection for statistical analysis. In addition, we focused
on SWS since duration of REM sleep was too short to evaluate
aversive stimuli-evoked responses. Comparison among the
4 treatments by repeated measure ANOVA (F(3,12) = 4.944,
p = 0.018) and subsequent multiple comparison with Tukey’s test
revealed that DORA-22 (p = 0.012) and triazolam (p = 0.046),
but not eszopiclone (p = 0.22), significantly increased total SWS
time during a 3-h period as compared to vehicle treatment
(Figure 1D). These drugs did not affect sleep episode duration
(F(3,12) = 0.906, p = 0.467; Figure 1E) but did decrease awake
episode duration (F(3,12) = 33.0, p < 0.001; Figure 1F).
Thus, we confirmed that DORA-22 and triazolam had similar
sleep promoting effects over a similar time course for the selected
dosages. From these results, we decided to compare vehicle,
DORA-22, and triazolam, but not eszopiclone, in the next step
of aversive stimuli-induced arousal testing. The testing took
place during the 1–4 h period after the drug injection because
the lag period for drug absorption and distribution appeared
to be approximately 1 h. The confirmation period required to
define sleep before stimulation was performed was set as 60 s
because each sleep episode typically lasted for approximately
200 s (Figure 1E).
Aversive Stimuli-Induced Arousal and
Return to Sleep After the Cessation of the
Stimuli
Next, we examined whether the animal was able to promptly
wake up from sleep induced by DORA-22 and triazolam in
response to aversive stimuli. We also examined the latency to
return to sleep after arousal. Latency to arousal and latency to
return to sleep in drug-treated groups were compared with those
in the vehicle-treated ‘‘natural’’ sleep group.
For auditory stimulation (Figure 2A), the latency to arousal
following vehicle, DORA-22, and triazolam administration was
3.0 (2.0–3.8), 3.5 (2.0–6.5), and 161 (117–267) s (median and
25–75 percentile in the parentheses, n = 8), respectively. After
mice received the vehicle and DORA-22, they woke up during
the stimulation period of 30 s but after triazolam mice woke
up after secession of the stimulus. Latency to return to sleep
after arousal was 148 (95–183), 70 (43–98), and 60 (52–69) s,
respectively for vehicle, DORA-22, and triazolam. Returning
to sleep was never observed during the stimulus period in
all the drug treatments. Statistical analysis using the Friedman
test and Dunn’s post hoc test showed that the latency to
arousal was significantly prolonged by triazolam (p = 0.005)
but not by DORA-22 (p > 0.99) when compared to vehicle.
Latency to return to sleep was significantly shorter in DORA-22
(p = 0.018) and triazolam (p = 0.004) when compared to vehicle
and there was no significant difference between DORA-22 and
triazolam (p > 0.99). Similar results were obtained for vestibular
stimulation (Figure 2B, n = 8) and olfactory stimulation
(Figure 2C, n = 10). The only exception was that there was
no significant difference between latency to return to sleep
in the vehicle treatment and DORA-22 treatment (p = 0.22)
after olfactory stimulation. This is probably because one out of
10 animals showed a longer latency to return to sleep under
DORA-22 than they did with vehicle.
In contrast to the above-mentioned auditory, vestibular, and
olfactory stimulation, there were no significant differences in
the latencies to arousal and return to sleep among vehicle,
DORA-22, and triazolam when hypoxia was used as a stimulus
(Figure 2D, n = 8). There was a time lag of about 120 s before
O2 concentration in the chamber reached 10% and most animals
woke up within that 120 s. For example, the O2 concentration
in the chamber when the mice woke up from sleep with vehicle,
DORA-22, and triazolam was 16.3 (15.4–18.4), 16.4 (15.0–17.9),
and 15.6 (14.4–17.6) % (median and 25–75 percentile in the

treated mice and significantly shorter than those in triazolam treated mice, with the exception of hypoxia. Also note that latency to return to sleep in DORA-22 treated

parentheses), respectively. There was no significant difference
among the drugs. Some animals re-slept even when the hypoxic
O2 concentration of 10% continued. Out of the eight animals
undergoing the hypoxic stimulation, the number that re-slept
under the vehicle, DORA-22, and triazolam conditions were 5,
5, and 7, respectively. A chi-square test revealed no statistical
differences (p = 0.446) among the treatments.
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that DORA-22 (100 mg/kg) and
triazolam (1.25 mg/kg) had similar sleep promoting effects
(30%–40% increase in SWS time as compared to vehicle) in a
similar time course (approximately 4 h after oral administration)
in mice. During this period, aversive stimuli-induced arousal and
the return to sleep after arousal were examined. As expected,
auditory stimulus-induced arousal was delayed significantly in
the triazolam treatment (p = 0.005) but not in the DORA-22
treatment (p > 0.99) when compared to the vehicle treatment.
Even though the DORA-22 treatment showed a short latency
to wake up, the sleep-promoting effect of DORA-22 seemed to
remain because the latency to return to sleep after arousal was
significantly shorter than vehicle treatment and not different
from triazolam. Similar results were obtained for vestibular and

olfactory stimuli-induced arousal and return to sleep. In contrast,
hypoxic stimulus-induced arousal and return to sleep were not
different among groups.
We had expected that eszopiclone (15 mg/kg) would show
a sleep promoting effect similar to triazolam and DORA-22
because eszopiclone as well as triazolam and suvorexant
(another DORA) are effective clinically in humans (Matheson
and Hainer, 2017). In a preliminary experiment, we tried a
higher dose of eszopiclone (100 mg/kg, n = 2) but the result
was similar to the selected dose of 15 mg/kg. Gotter et al.
(2014) reported that the sleep-promoting effects of eszopiclone
are highly species specific. In their study, they showed that
treatment with eszopiclone resulted in consistent effects in
rats and rhesus monkeys, variable effects in mice (60 mg/kg),
and paradoxical hyperarousal in dogs. The reason behinds
the differences in species has not yet been revealed, but the
authors speculated that possible differences in the GABAergic
pathways in the brains of these species may be the cause. It
may be interesting to point out that activation of extrasynaptic
GABA-A receptor in the pontine reticular formation promotes
wakefulness (Vanini and Baghdoyan, 2013). In any case, we
stopped further experimentation using eszopiclone because our
main purpose was to examine any possible effects DORA-22
may have on negative valence stimuli-induced arousal and
compare it with at least one of the GABA-A receptor modulators.
We were able to confirm that triazolam was suitable for this
purpose. Nevertheless, we admit that possible species difference
in the effectiveness of different drugs is a limitation of this
study.
The prolonged latency to wake up during triazolam treatment
did not seem to be caused by a general inhibition of waking
systems in the brain because there was no significant change in
the latency to wake in response to hypoxic stimulus (Figure 2D).
Rather, it seemed to be caused by inhibition of sensory input
pathways. An increase in latency to wake from triazolam
treatment in the auditory and vestibular stimuli tests indicated
an importance of the thalamus where the GABA-A receptor is
involved in sensory gating before the signal reaches the cerebral
cortex (McCormick and Bal, 1994). The unchanged latency to
wake in response to hypoxic stimulus may be explained by
the fact that autonomic reflex-like responses do not depend on
the thalamo-cortical pathway. A possible contribution of the
medullary GABAergic pathway, however, has been proposed to
be responsible for arousal in response to intermittent hypoxia
(Darnall et al., 2012). One of the more surprising results was
that the latency to wake in response to olfactory stimulus
was also prolonged with triazolam treatment. It is interesting
because olfactory information directly reaches the cerebral
olfactory cortex from the glomerulus in the olfactory bulb and
thus is not gated by the thalamus. The periglomerular cells
of the olfactory system that contain the GABA-A receptor
(Panzanelli et al., 2007) may be responsible for the gating
effect.
We noticed that latency to return to sleep after arousal by
aversive stimuli (150–300 s in vehicle and 50–100 s in DORA-22
and triazolam, Figures 2A–C) was similar to and did not exceed
awake episode durations in our tests where no stimuli were given
(∼300 s in vehicle and ∼100 s in DORA-22 and triazolam,
Figure 1F). This result indicates that the aversive stimuli used
in this experiment were mild enough to not elicit a continuous
alerting effect on the mice. Due to the observation that DORA-22
and triazolam were effective for approximately 4 h, at least
without stimulation (Figure 1), and aversive stimulus-induced
arousal testing was performed within this time window, it was
not surprising to observe a short latency to return to sleep in the
drug-treated groups.
We used within-subject design to compare drugs’ effect for
each aversive stimulus. This design gives us higher statistical
power than independent design but at the same time possible
habituation effect to the stimulus may distort the results.
However, such habituation effect seemed minimal in the current
experimental setting and randomized order of dosing. If the
habituation effect took place, then some animals that were
treated with vehicle after DORA-22 and/or triazolam should
had longer latency to arousal than those that was treated
with vehicle as the first drug. This seemed not the case since
the data distribution for vehicle showed very narrow range
(Figure 2). In addition to statistical high power, within-subject
design needs fewer animals than independent design. Therefore,
when habituation effect is enough smaller than the effect of
interest, within-subject design is a good choice of experimental
design.
Orexin exerts its wake promoting/stabilizing effect through
activation of monoaminergic systems such as noradrenaline
in the locus coeruleus, serotonin in the dorsal raphe, and
histamine in the tuberomammillary nucleus (Sakurai, 2007).
Thus, the sleep-promoting effect of orexin receptor blockade is
believed to be elicited by an inhibition of orexin signaling in
these nuclei. Although orexin receptors are also expressed in
some thalamic nuclei (Marcus et al., 2001), possible effects of
orexin receptor blockade on sensory input gating have not yet
been reported. It is of interest to note that orexin is involved
in stress-induced analgesia (Watanabe et al., 2005; Inutsuka
et al., 2016) as well through possible activation of descending
pain-inhibitory pathways (Ho et al., 2011). If orexin does also
plays a role in sensory input gating, it seems plausible for it
to also be anti-nociceptive. Therefore, any effect that orexin
receptor blockade might have on sensory gating may occur
in a direction opposite to that of any sleep-related sensory
gating.
CONCLUSION
The findings of this study are consistent with the distinct
mechanisms of these sleep promoting therapies; GABA-A
receptor activation by triazolam is thought to induce widespread
CNS suppression, which includes sensory gating systems, while
DORA-22 more specifically targets sleep/wake pathways through
orexin receptor antagonism. These data support the notion that
DORA-22 preserves the ability to wake in response to aversive
and consciousness-inducing stimuli, regardless of modality,
while remaining effective in the absence of the threat. This study
provides a unique and important point of view for the evaluation
of the safety of these hypnotics.
