IMPORTANCE Influenza immunization of women during pregnancy protects the young infants
against influenza illness. The duration of this protection remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the duration of infant protection conferred by maternal immunization
and its association with transplacental antibody transfer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Infants born to women who participated in a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 2011 and 2012 on the safety,
immunogenicity, and efficacy of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) during
pregnancy were followed up during the first 6 months of life for polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)–confirmed influenza illness. In a secondary analysis of a subset of infants,
hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibodies were measured. The study was performed at a
single center in South Africa. The secondary analysis was performed in October 2014.
EXPOSURE Maternal immunization for influenza.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The vaccine’
s efficacy against PCR-confirmed influenza
illness and the percentage of infants with HAI titers of 1:40 or more by age group.
RESULTS There were 1026 infants (47.2% female) born to IIV3 recipients and 1023 infants
(47.3% female) born to placebo recipients who were included in the analysis of the vaccine’
s
efficacy. The vaccine’
s efficacy against PCR-confirmed influenza illness was highest among
infants 8 weeks of age or younger at 85.6% (95% CI, 38.3%-98.4%) and decreased with
increasing age to 25.5% (95% CI, −67.9% to 67.8%) among infants 8 to 16 weeks of age and
to 30.3% (95% CI, −154.9% to 82.6%) among infants 16 to 24 weeks of age. Similarly, in the
IIV3 group, the percentage of infants with HAI titers of 1:40 or more to the influenza vaccine
strains decreased from more than 56% in the first week of life to less than 40% at 16 weeks
of age and less than 10.0% at 24 weeks of age.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Maternal immunization conferred protection against
infection in the infants for a limited period during early life. The lack of protection beyond 8
weeks of age correlated with a decrease in maternally derived antibodies.

T
he incidence of influenza illness among infants is high
and is associated with a substantial increase in outpa-
tient visits and hospitalizations during the influenza
season,1,2 especially among infants younger than 6 months of
age.2-4 There are also concomitantly high rates of influenza-
related deaths in this age group.5,6 While active annual influ-
enza vaccination is the most efficient mode for the preven-
tion of influenza, current vaccines are poorly immunogenic
and not licensed for use for infants younger than 6 months
of age. Alternative strategies to prevent influenza illness in
young infants include passive protection or cocooning
through vaccination of pregnant women and other house-
hold members.7
We recently reported that immunization with trivalent in-
activated influenza vaccine (IIV3) of pregnant women unin-
fected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was
safe and immunogenic and partially protected the women and
their infants with a vaccine efficacy of 50% and 49%, respec-
tively, against polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–confirmed in-
fluenza illness during a 24-week follow-up period after
delivery.8 The exact duration of the protection for the in-
fants, however, was never assessed and is generally de-
scribed during the overall follow-up period (often the first 6
months of life).8,9
Furthermore, we also described the kinetics of the trans-
placentally acquired hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) anti-
bodiesintheinfantsofvaccinatedwomenanddeterminedthat
thehalf-lifeofHAIantibodiesintheinfantswas43to45days.10
In this secondary analysis, we report on the secondary and ex-
ploratory objectives of the study, which were to determine the
percentage of infants born to vaccinated mothers and the per-
centage of infants born to unvaccinated mothers, both with
seroprotectivetitersfrombirthto24weeksofage,andtoevalu-
ate the protection conferred to the infant by maternal immu-
nization stratified by age group.
Methods
Study Design
Details of the study have been published elsewhere.8 In
brief, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical trial of IIV3 for HIV-uninfected pregnant
women in Soweto, South Africa.8 This involved 2 cohorts of
HIV-uninfected pregnant women in their second/third tri-
mester who were enrolled prior to the onset of the influenza
seasons in 2011 (n = 1060) and 2012 (n = 1056). A subset of
these women and their babies were included in the immu-
nogenicity substudy; these participants were recruited from
when enrollment started until the desirable sample size was
reached. Women and their infants were followed up to 24
weeks post partum. The present report describes results
from the infants born to the mothers enrolled in the study.
The study used the influenza vaccine recommended by the
World Health Organization for the southern hemisphere for
both the 2011 and 2012 influenza seasons (A/California/7/
2009 [A/H1N1pdm09], A/Victoria/210/2009 [H3N2], and
B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus [B/Victoria lineage]; Vaxi-
grip; Sanofi Pasteur)11,12 and sterile 0.9% normal saline solu-
tion as placebo.
Ethical Considerations
The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Com-
mittee of the University of the Witwatersrand, registered at
ClinicalTrial.gov,andconductedinaccordancewithGoodClini-
cal Practice guidelines. Mothers provided written informed
consent for themselves and their infants.
Sample Collection and Testing
Bloodsampleswereobtainedfrominfantswithin7daysofbirth
and at 8 weeks of age (56-63 days), 16 weeks of age (111-119
days), and 24 weeks of age (168-175 days). The HAI assays were
performed as previously described.13 The percentage of in-
fants with HAI titers of 1:40 or more (putative correlate of pro-
tection) was calculated.
Active surveillance for respiratory illness was performed
through weekly contact with study participants. Infants with
suspected influenza-like illness, as well as those presenting
with or hospitalized for any respiratory illness, underwent a
procedure to obtain nasopharyngeal aspirate samples. These
sampleswereplacedinviraltransportmediumandtestedwith
a qualitative 2-step real-time reverse transcriptase–PCR as-
say. Primers and probe sets targeted either the matrix gene or
the hemagglutinin gene designed for the universal detection
of type A and B influenza viruses, respectively. All influenza
A viruses were further subtyped as either H1 or H3, and the in-
fluenza B viruses as B/Victoria (homotypic vaccine strain) or
B/Yamagata.14
Statistical Analysis
Allanalysesofstudyoutcomeswereperformedundertheprin-
ciple of intention to treat, meaning that infants born less than
28 days after their mothers had been vaccinated and preterm
infants(ie,<37weeksofgestationalageatbirthorabirthweight
of <2500 g) were included in the analyses. The immunogenic-
ity analysis included all infants who had blood samples that
wereobtainedwithintheprotocol-definedtimeperiodsateach
particular time point. Infants who had an episode of PCR-
confirmed influenza illness or serological evidence of influ-
enza (ie, ≥4-fold increase in HAI titers between birth and any
Key Points
Question For infants, what is the duration of protection against
influenza illness conferred by maternal immunization?
Findings Infants born to women who participated in a
randomized clinical trial of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine
during pregnancy were followed up to determine the vaccine’
s
efficacy against influenza illness and the infants’antibody levels
during the first 6 months of life. The vaccine’
s efficacy was highest
among infants 8 weeks of age or younger, and the percentage of
infants with seroprotective titers decreased from birth to 6
months.
Meaning Maternal immunization conferred protection against
infection to the infants for a limited period during early life that
correlated with a decrease in maternally derived antibodies.

Results
Of 2049 infants included in the vaccine efficacy analysis, 1026
wereborntomotherswhoreceivedIIV3duringpregnancy,and
1023 were born to mothers who received to placebo during
pregnancy (Table 1). Infants were born at a mean of 81.0 days
(range, 1-175 days) after maternal vaccination and were moni-
tored for influenza illness for a median of 172 days of life (in-
terquartile range, 168-175 days). The baseline demographic
characteristics and follow-up times were similar between in-
fants in the IIV3 group and infants in the placebo group. An
immunogenicity substudy enrolled 331 infants, including 9 (6
born to IIV3 recipients) who did not have any samples col-
lected within the study’
s window periods and were excluded
from the analysis. The 161 evaluable infants born to IIV3
recipients had similar characteristics and follow-up times as
the 161 infants born to placebo recipients (Table 1). Infants
in the immunogenicity substudy had characteristics similar
to those of the entire cohort, except for a lower percentage
of girls in the substudy (41.7% vs 48.3%; P = .03) and a
shorter follow-up (168 vs 174 days; P < .001) (eTable in the
Supplement).
The percentages of infants born to IIV3 recipients with
HAI titers of 1:40 or more at birth was 78.3% for the
A/H1N1pdm09 strain, 56.6% for the A/H3N2 strain, and 81.1%
for the B/Victoria stain; and these percentages were signifi-
cantly higher than those of infants born to placebo recipients
(33.6% for the A/H1N1pdm09 strain, 17.3% for the A/H3N2
strain, and 41.8% for the B/Victoria strain; P < .001 for all
comparisons) (Figure 2). The percentage of infants with HAI
titers of 1:40 or more decreased in both groups during the
first 24 weeks of age. At 16 weeks of age, 39.5%, 19.1%, and
40% of infants born to IIV3 recipients had HAI titers of 1:40
or more for the A/H1N1pdm09 strain, the A/H3N2 strain, and
the B/Victoria strain, respectively, and at 24 weeks of age, the
percentages were further reduced to 10.0%, 6.7%, and 9.4%,
respectively. Corresponding percentages of infants with HAI
titers of 1:40 or more in the placebo group were 5% to 9% at
16 weeks (P ≤ .001 for all comparisons) and 3.5% (P = .06),
0% (P = .01), and 1.7% (P = .02), respectively, at 24 weeks
(Figure 2).
Thirty-seven infants born to placebo recipients and 19
infants born to IIV3 recipients experienced 1 episode of PCR-
confirmed influenza illness during the study follow-up
period8 (Table 2). Of the 37 infants born to placebo recipients,
14 were 8 weeks of age or younger, 16 were between 8 and 16
weeks of age, and 7 were between 16 and 24 weeks of age; of

the 19 infants born to IIV3 recipients, 2 were 8 weeks of age
or younger, 12 were between 8 and 16 weeks of age, and 5
were between 16 and 24 weeks of age. The vaccine efficacy
(against PCR-confirmed influenza illness) was highest when
limited to outcomes occurring among infants 8 weeks of age
or younger (85.6% [95% CI, 38.3%-98.4%]). The estimated
vaccine efficacy) gradually decreased with increasing age,
including a vaccine efficacy of 53.9% (95% CI, 10.4%-77.4%)
for infants 16 weeks of age or younger and 49.5% (95% CI,
9.9%-72.6%) for infants 24 weeks of age or younger. No pro-
tective effect of IIV3 was detected if the analysis was
restricted to infants between 8 and 16 weeks of age (vaccine
efficacy, 25.5% [95% CI, −67.9% to 67.8%]) or between 16 and
24 weeks of age (vaccine efficacy, 30.3% [95% CI, −154.9% to
82.6%]). Restricting the outcomes to those that occurred dur-
ing the influenza season yielded similar vaccine efficacy esti-
mates (Table 2).
Seventeen infants in the immunogenicity substudy had
an episode of PCR-confirmed influenza illness (7 born to IIV3
recipients and 10 born to placebo recipients). Of these 17
infants, 7 had an episode in which the B/Yamagata strain was
detected (2 from the IIV3 group), 5 had an episode in which
the A/H3N2 strain was detected (2 from the IIV3 group), 4
had an episode in which the B/Victoria strain was detected (3
from the IIV3 group), and 1 from the placebo group had an
episode in which t he A/H1N1pdm09 and A/H3N2 strains
were simultaneously detected. All 5 infants infected with a
homotypic vaccine strain born to IIV3 recipients were
between 8 and 16 weeks of age and had a blood sample
obtained for determination of HAI titer immediately preced-
ing the influenza episode at an average of 34.6 days (range,
7-56 days). Of the 5 infants in the placebo group infected with
a homotypic vaccine strain, 1 was 45 days of age, 2 were
between 8 and 16 weeks of age, and 2 were between 16 and
24 weeks of age, and blood samples were available for deter-
mination of HAI titer at a mean 27.6 days (range, 15-38 days)
before the influenza episode. Table 3 shows that the HAI
titers at the immunogenicity visits preceding the episode of
PCR-confirmed influenza illness were 1:40 or more in 3 cases
(2 in the IIV3 group and 1 in the placebo group) and less than
1:40 in the remaining 8 cases of infection (3 in the IIV3 group
and 5 in the placebo group).
Discussion
We and others have previously demonstrated that the
administration of IIV3 during pregnancy confers protection
against symptomatic influenza infection to the infants of
the vaccinated mothers8,9; here we show that the duration
of this protection is likely to be limited to the first 8 weeks
of age. Several potential mechanisms of protection have
been proposed, such as maternal immunization against
influenza providing indirect protection of the infant by
preventing transmission of influenza virus from the mother
to the baby, maternal antibody-mediated protection
through transplacental transfer, or maternal antibody-
mediated protection through breast milk.10,17,18 Our study
suggests that the most likely mechanism of protection of
the infants is through the transplacental transfer of mater-
nal antibodies.10,19,20
The concentration of maternally acquired antibodies de-
creased rapidly in the infants, and by 16 weeks of age, less than
40% of the infants born to IIV3 recipients had HAI titers of 1:40
or more for any of the vaccine strains, mimicking the reduc-
tioninvaccineefficacy.AlthoughtheHAItiterthresholdof1:40
is generally recognized as corresponding to a 50% reduction
in the risk of influenza illness in adults, this may be too low to
confer adequate protection in children, and it was estimated
that a more appropriate titer for 50% protection in children

cause the threshold of maternally acquired HAI antibodies as
a predictor of protection against influenza in young infants is
unknown, we used the 1:40 threshold as guidance, anticipat-
ing that a higher threshold would predict an even shorter time
of protection.
The fact that lower levels of HAI antibodies are associ-
ated with reduced protection was also observed in the pri-
mary analysis of our IIV3 trials in which both HIV-infected
and HIV-uninfected pregnant women participated. In the
primary analysis, we showed that HIV-exposed infants had
significantly lower HAI titers than HIV-unexposed infants
throughout the first 6 months of life and a higher incidence
of influenza compared with infants born to uninfected
mothers. Although the studies were not powered to show
efficacy in the HIV-exposed infants, in the intention-to-treat
analysis, we did not detect any indication that maternal immu-
nization may prevent disease in HIV-exposed infants.8,10
The amount of maternal antibodies transferred to the in-
fant is influenced by the interval between immunization and
delivery.23,24 We have previously shown that a higher trans-
placental antibody transfer was achieved with a longer inter-
val between vaccination and delivery, which suggests that a
prolonged cumulative transfer of antibodies leads to higher
quantity of antibodies at birth compared with a shorter pe-
riod during maximal transplacental transfer.10 Our study finds
that, to achieve better infant protection, vaccination during
pregnancy should not be delayed until the third trimester.
The main limitation of this study is that the same IIV3
formulation was used in both study years. It would be impor-
tant to confirm these results in other seasons and in different
populations.

Conclusions
Estimating the period that infants can be protected through
maternal vaccination has important implications, especially
since currently there is no influenza vaccine licensed for use
in infants younger than 6 months of age. To enhance the
concentration of the antibodies transferred transplacentally
and decrease the period of vulnerability to disease in young
infants, there is the need to find more immunogenic vac-
cines for pregnant women. Alternatively, more immuno-
genic vaccines that can generate a protective immune
response in infants, beginning at 8 weeks of age, need to
be identified. Importantly, whereas protection conferred
by vaccination is likely to be mediated by both antibodies
and cellular-immune responses in vaccine recipients, pas-
sive protection of infants is almost exclusively mediated by
antibodies.
