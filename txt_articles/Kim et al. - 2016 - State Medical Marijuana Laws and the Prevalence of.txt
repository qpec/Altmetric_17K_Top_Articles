Objectives. To assess the association between medical marijuana laws (MMLs) and the
odds of a positive opioid test, an indicator for prior use.
Methods. We analyzed 1999–2013 Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data
from 18 states that tested for alcohol and other drugs in at least 80% of drivers who died
within 1 hour of crashing (n = 68 394). Within-state and between-state comparisons
assessed opioid positivity among drivers crashing in states with an operational MML
(i.e., allowances for home cultivation or active dispensaries) versus drivers crashing in
states before a future MML was operational.
Results. State-specific estimates indicated a reduction in opioid positivity for most
states after implementation of an operational MML, although none of these estimates
were significant. When we combined states, we observed no significant overall asso-
ciation (odds ratio [OR] = 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.61, 1.03). However,
age-stratified analyses indicated a significant reduction in opioid positivity for drivers
aged 21 to 40 years (OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.37, 0.67; interaction P < .001).
Conclusions. Operational MMLs are associated with reductions in opioid pos-
itivity among 21- to 40-year-old fatally injured drivers and may reduce opioid
use and overdose. (Am J Public Health. 2016;106:2032–2037. doi:10.2105/

n 1996, California Proposition 215,
a voter-initiated medical marijuana law
(MML), received 55.6% of the popular vote
and became law. Proposition 215 provided
criminal protections for patients as well as
defined caregivers, who in turn could cultivate
the marijuana that physicians could now rec-
ommend.1 Since then, 22 additional states
and the District of Columbia have enacted
their own MMLs, either by voter initiative or
through state legislation. Of these laws, the
MMLs in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, New York, and the District of
Columbia are the only ones that do not allow
marijuana to be recommended or authorized
for severe or chronic pain,2 and they tend to
be more medically oriented and restrictive.3
In the United States, nonmalignant chronic
pain afflicts a growing proportion of adults.4
Theprescriptionofopioidsforthetreatmentof
this type of pain has also increased.5,6 How-
ever, despite the legitimate benefits conferred
by these drugs, the potential for harm has
caused some concern,7,8 perhaps because of
large increases in opioid use disorders9,10 and
opioid overdoses11,12 observed within the last
2 decades. Furthermore, recent policies
aimed at reducing the supply of opioid pre-
scriptions (e.g., prescription drug monitoring
programs) may have also inadvertently led
to recent increases in heroin overdoses.13
Alternatives for the treatment of chronic pain
are clearly needed.14
Marijuana may offer a substitute to
opioids in many states with MMLs.15,16
Unfortunately, data on treatment efficacy is
limited, in large part because of current federal
scheduling. Regardless, severe or chronic
pain is among the most common indications
cited by medical marijuana patients.17 In
theory, we would expect the adverse con-
sequences of opioid use to decrease over
time in states where medical marijuana use is
legal, as individuals substitute marijuana for
opioids. In a recent study of MMLs and opioid
overdoses,18 state MMLs were associated
with reductions in the annual rate of state-
level opioid overdoses. The relationship be-
tween MMLs and other indicators of opioid
use or adverse consequences needs to be
further examined, as this relationship
potentially identifies actionable points of
intervention on a growing opioid epidemic
(e.g., expanding eligible medical conditions
for marijuana to include chronic pain).
One such indicator is the prevalence of
opioid use. Although opioid use can be dif-
ficult to measure, tested opioid positivity in
blood or urine is objective, and it provides
a clear indicator of any prior opioid use, for
medical or recreational purposes. Although
we know of no representative general pop-
ulation data with tested opioid positivity
among living participants, toxicological
tests for substances among drivers fatally in-
jured in car crashes represents a potential data
source. Repeated annual panels of drivers
killed in crashes in states with and without
MMLs are available; in some states, data are
uniformly collected for the majority of de-
ceased drivers. Furthermore, states that do not

 have an MML but eventually pass one are
more similar to states in which an MML has
already been passed, reducing the possibility
of bias in comparing MML and non-MML
states.19 Thus, our aim was to empirically
assess whether, among drivers who died
within 1 hour of a traffic collision, crashing in
a state with an MML was associated with
a reduced likelihood of opioid positivity com-
pared with crashing in a state that would
eventually pass an MML but had not yet done so.
METHODS
We obtained study data from the Fatality
Analysis Reporting System (FARS), which
provides a census of all crashes on public roads
that result in a traffic fatality. This includes
data from police records, state administrative
files, and medical records on the persons,
vehicles, and circumstances related to each
crash.20 To limit any false positive drug testing
results, we restricted our sample to drivers
who died within 1 hour of crashing from 1999
to 2013 (n = 215 384).
We excluded drivers younger than 15
years (n = 507) or with missing data on age
(included categories = 15–20, 21–40, and
‡ 41 years) or gender (n = 50). In addition,
although the FARS provides data for all states,
toxicological testing of fatally injured drivers
is inconsistently performed across states.21
States that do not perform drug and alcohol
testing on the majority of their drivers may be
selectively testing drivers that appear im-
paired.22 Thus, we restricted our analysis to
include only states that tested at least 80% of
fatally injured drivers (n = 70 683) from 1999
to 2013 (18 states; Table 1), a threshold
consistent with previous studies.23–25 Al-
though testing for New Mexico was above
this threshold, because there were in-
explicably low numbers of drivers testing
positive for drugs, we deemed data from this
state to be unreliable and excluded them.22,26
Finally, we also excluded drivers with
missing outcome data (n = 2289; 3.2%).
In total, we included 68 394 deceased drivers
from 18 states.
Measures
Drug and alcohol test results. Blood or urine
specimens were tested for drugs through
gas–liquid chromatography, mass spectrom-
etry, and radioimmunoassay techniques.27
For each driver, the FARS records up to 3
nonalcoholic drugs detected in the blood or
urine. If multiple drugs are detected, the
FARS records results in the following priority
order: narcotics, depressants, stimulants,
marijuana, and other.20 In accordance with
the FARS coding manual,28 we based prior
opioid use on the coding of any narcotic
(codes 100–295). The FARS determines
driver’s blood alcohol content and drug
content separately; we coded blood alcohol
content as negative, positive, or missing.
State medical marijuana laws. Because state
MMLs vary in how medical marijuana is
provided and made available,29 we coded
only states that provided access to medical
marijuana (through either one’s own or
collective cultivation or through public or
private dispensaries) as having an operational
medical marijuana law, and we based oper-
ational dates on when access was made
available. For example, New Hampshire and
Illinois have effective dates within or im-
mediately after our study period (2013 and
2014, respectively); however, because they
did not allow home cultivation and dispen-
saries were not operational until after our
study period, we coded these states as negative
throughout. For states that implemented
an operational MML during our study period,
we coded MML status as positive for all
years following the operational date of
availability and negative for the preceding
periods. If the law became operational during

 the first half of the year (i.e., before July 1), we
coded MML status as positive starting with
that year. If the law became operational
during the second half of the year, we coded
MML status as positive starting with the
subsequent year, as follows: Hawaii, 2001;
Colorado, 2002; Vermont, 2005; Montana,
2005; Rhode Island, 2006; New Jersey, 2013.
We coded California and Washington as
positive for MML status for the entire study
period. We considered the remaining states
that had not yet passed an operational MML as
negative throughout the study period (North
Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and
West Virginia). Additionally, in the state-
combined analysis, we controlled for whether
the state had ever passed a medical marijuana
law.19 This included the states with an op-
erational MML at any point during the
study period as well as states with laws that
were not yet operational (Connecticut,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Illinois, and
Maryland).
State prescription drug monitoring program
laws. Prescription drug monitoring programs
(PDMPs) may confound any association
between state MMLs and individual opioid
use if PDMPs are associated with the timing of
state MMLs and an independent cause of
opioid use. To account for this, we used 4
time-varying measures of PDMP character-
istics obtained from LawAtlas: (1) “PDMP
mandatory,” which requires health pro-
fessionals to report their prescribing; (2)
“PDMP real-time,” which requires that
prescribing data be updated at least once
weekly; (3) “PDMP proactive,” which re-
quires proactive identification of suspicious
prescribing, dispensing, or purchasing; and (4)
“PDMP oversight,” which requires an
oversight board. These indicators have been
used previously to characterize variations
across PDMP programs.30 In this study, we
compared the absence of all of these PDMP
characteristics with the presence of 1 or of
2 or more of them.
State-Combined Analysis
First, to help characterize our study pop-
ulation, we ran cross-tabs between MML
status and multiple driver and state-level
characteristics. To assess the average impact of
MML across states, we used a multilevel lo-
gistic regression with a random effect for
state of crash and fixed effects for year of crash,
presence of PDMP characteristics, and
driver’s age category, gender, and blood al-
cohol content. The 2 main independent
variables were operational MML status and
whether the state had ever passed an MML
(model 1). This specification allowed us to
compare drivers crashing in states after an
operational MML was implemented with
drivers crashing in states before one was
implemented. This reduced bias related to
comparing states with and without an MML,
as states that will eventually adopt an opera-
tional MML are more comparable to states
with a current law than to states that have
never passed a law.19 Furthermore, to test
whether the effect of operational MML
varied by age category, we included separate
interaction terms between age category
and the 2 main independent variables. We
report the test of overall significance for the
interaction between age category and oper-
ational MML status; if it is significant, we
present age-stratified estimates.
State-Specific Sensitivity Analysis
As a sensitivity analysis, we explored
state-specific effects of an MML on opioid
positivity using a “difference-in-difference”
approach. In this method, state fixed effects
are used to capture within-state changes in the
outcome among the exposed group, which
is then contrasted with the change in outcome
observed among an unexposed control
group. Under the assumption that the pre-
intervention trend is similar in the 2 groups,
any differences between states with and
without an MML (measured or not) that may
also influence opioid positivity (e.g., societal
norms) is “differenced” out and does not
bias effect estimates.31 Although statistical
power is limited in such analyses, they are
useful in showing state-specific effects, and
can be used to compare results from other
designs and modeling specifications. We
conducted state-specific analyses on 4 states
with at least 3 years of data before and after an
MML became operational: Colorado (1999–
2004), Montana (2002–2007), Vermont
(2002–2007) and Rhode Island (2003–2008).
For each comparison, besides the state of
interest, we included as controls only those
states in our sample that performed majority
testing (i.e., ‡ 80% of drivers who died within
1 hour of crashing) and did not have an
operational MML during each 6-year period.
Each difference-in-difference analysis first
used all eligible states and then repeated the
analysis only in states that ever passed an
MML, regardless of whether it was opera-
tional or not. Sample size limitations pre-
cluded the ability to obtain age-stratified
estimates. Results are provided in Table A and
Figure A (available as a supplement to the
online version of this article at http://www.
ajph.org). We conducted all analyses using
Stata SE version 13 (StataCorp LP, College
Station, TX). The technical appendix
(available as a supplement to the online
version of this article at http://www.ajph.

cate our analyses.
RESULTS
Among our sample of 68 394 deceased
drivers, approximately 41.8% were fatally
injured in states that had an operational MML,
25.4% died in states before an operational
law went into effect, and 32.8% died in states
that had never passed an MML (Table 2). The
mean age of all deceased drivers was ap-
proximately 41 years, and most (> 75%) were
male. There was also a relatively stable level
of alcohol involvement across MML status,
although there was more missing alcohol data
for deceased drivers in states before an
MML was operational (6.4%) than in states
with an operational MML (2.1%) or in states
that had never had an MML (3.7%). In ad-
dition, although nearly all states had some
form of PDMP, the presence of PDMP
characteristics appeared to vary by operational
MML status (Table 2). Figure 1 displays
trends in opioid positivity across the study
years by the MML status of the state in which
the deceased drivers crashed.
State-Combined Analysis
In the overall sample, after we adjusted for
driver’s age, gender, blood alcohol content,
a state-level indicator of whether the state had
ever passed a medical marijuana law, and
PDMP characteristics, crashing in a state with
an operational MML versus crashing in one
where an MML was not yet operational
was not associated with the odds of opioid

 positivity (odds ratio [OR] = 0.79; 95%
confidence interval [CI] = 0.61, 1.03;
Table 3). Tests of interaction between an
operational MML and age indicated that the
association between MML and opioid posi-
tivity varied significantly by age (c2 = 48.7;
P < .001). After we adjusted for both indi-
vidual and PDMP characteristics (Table 3),
compared with drivers aged 21 to 40 years
who crashed in states before an operational
MML, drivers of the same age range who
crashed in states with an operational MML
had lower odds of opioid positivity
(OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.37, 0.67). We ob-
served no significant associations for other
age groups.
State-Specific Sensitivity Analysis
Figure A plots the prevalence of opioid
positivity for each MML state compared with
the observed average among control states
with no operational MML. For each state
comparison (Table A), we contrast the count
and percentage of opioid positivity before
and after an operational MML was imple-
mented (and the before-vs-after difference)
with those of 2 overlapping controls groups:
(1) controls in states that had performed
majority testing (all eligible controls) and (2)
controls only in states that had passed an
MML. The difference-in-difference estimate
signifies the estimated change in opioid
positivity associated with an operational
MML. For example, after we adjusted for
state and year of crash as well as driver’s age,
gender, and blood alcohol content, Montana
experienced a 1.7% reduction (risk differ-
ence = –1.72; 95% CI = –5.5, 2.1) in opioid
positivity after its MML became operational
relative to the expected change in opioid
positivity among states that had ever passed an
MML (Table A). Although none of these
state-specific estimates were significant, there
were trends in all states toward a reduction in
opioid positivity.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we assessed whether, among
comparable samples, implementing an op-
erational MML was associated with re-
ductions in opioid positivity. We did this by
comparing drivers crashing in states with an
operational MML with drivers crashing in
states before a future MML became opera-
tional. We performed this comparison in 2
disparate ways: by grouping drivers across
states (i.e., the state-combined analysis) and
by comparing before-versus-after trends

 within the same state (i.e., the state-specific
analysis). We found that among 21- to 40-
year-old deceased drivers, crashing in states
with an operational MML was associated with
lower odds of testing positive for opioids
than crashing in MML states before these laws
were operational. Although we found a sig-
nificant association only among drivers
aged 21 to 40 years, the age specificity of this
finding coheres with what we know about
MMLs: a minimum age requirement
restricts access to medical marijuana for most
patients younger than 21 years, and most
surveyed medical marijuana patients are
younger than 45 years.17,32 Although the
uptake of medical marijuana has been his-
torically concentrated among young adults,
we would expect to see similar reductions in
opioid use among older cohorts if medical
marijuana is increasingly embraced by older
generations.
Our findings among those aged 21 to
40 years are consistent with previous findings
that MMLs are associated with a 25% re-
duction in the annual rate of opioid over-
dose18 and that states permitting medical
marijuana dispensaries experience a slight
decrease in opioid treatment admissions and
in opioid overdose mortality.30 Few studies
have previously attempted to explain this
mechanism. One study assessed opioid use
among a large representative sample,33 but it
found no impact of MMLs on self-reported
use. However, the survey question that
captured opioid use only assessed “non-
medical use” of pain medications, limiting the
information on medication used legitimately
for pain. It is possible that the weight of
any benefit is mostly conferred on patients
who have legitimate need for pain medica-
tions. For example, in 1 study conducted in
Utah, the majority of opioid overdose de-
cedents in 2008 and 2009 had previously been
prescribed opioids for their own conditions.34
One other study found that MMLs were
not associated with the quantity of opioids
dispensed at the state level,30 suggesting that
any reductions in opioid overdoses may not
be reflected in the overall sales of opioids.
However, if MMLs are in fact reducing
opioid overdoses, it follows that this mech-
anism would entail reductions in individual
opioid use, which may not be characterized
by an aggregate measure of opioids dispensed
at the state level. By contrast, the findings in
our study suggest that MMLs are associated
with reductions in opioid positivity, an in-
dicator for previous use, at least among
drivers aged 21 to 40 years who died within
1 hour of crashing.
Limitations and Strengths
This study has several notable limitations.
First, we cannot infer causation in the study;
however, the results can be used to assess the
plausibility of some alternative explanations.
For example, the observed association
could be explained by other factors (e.g.,
increased highway safety expenditures after
MML implementation) or by differential
selection into the study (e.g., opioid-exposed
drivers are less willing to drive in MML states).
Although these alternative explanations
cannot be ruled out, the number of fatally
injured drivers was remarkably consistent
across years and states (online Table A),
making such biases less likely. For example,
in the 3 years prior to implementing its
MML, Colorado had 687 drivers who died
within 1 hour of crashing; in the following
3 years, it had 691 such deaths.
Second, because we included only a subset
of states in our analysis, our results may not be
generalizable to all of the United States.
However, this was necessary to limit biases
related to outcome-dependent selection (e.g.,
selective testing of inebriated drivers). Al-
though our findings may apply only to de-
ceased drivers in these states, we would expect
to see similar findings across comparable sam-
ples living in states with and without an MML.
Third, we used a broad measure of opioid
use, which included any narcotic coded
within the FARS. However, any resulting
outcome misclassification is likely similar in
states with and without medical marijuana
laws (i.e., nondifferential), which would bias
our results toward the null. This limitation is
offset by the advantages of an objective
measure of drug use, as most previous studies
assessing the impact of medical marijuana laws
have relied on self-reported measures.
There are also study strengths. First,
few studies have assessed the association be-
tween state MMLs and opioid use at the
individual level, and to our knowledge, this is
the first to do so with an objective measure of
opioid use. Second, although MMLs are
heterogeneous across states, our classification
of MML status was narrow and well defined.
Although this degree of specificity did not
allow us to explore other provisions of
MMLs (e.g., criminal protection for patients),
future studies should examine these as sepa-
rate indicators with the potential to have
disparate influences on substance use. Third,
we accounted for the considerable state
heterogeneity in both the measurement of
our outcome (i.e., toxicological testing pro-
cedures) and trends in opioid use and
opioid-related harms broadly. To correct for
this in our state-combined analysis, we in-
cluded a random intercept for state of crash
and excluded states that did not perform
majority testing. Furthermore, we also per-
formed state-specific analyses that assessed
within-state changes that eliminated most
time-invariant sources of bias. Lastly, we
observed consistent findings when making
within-state and between-state comparisons,
2 models with varying assumptions.
Conclusions
Because of the uniqueness of our sample, it
is worth noting again that our outcome is

 opioid positivity (i.e., prior opioid use), which
is not necessarily indicative of driving im-
pairment. This study was not designed to
assess whether opioids increase crash risk.
Instead, we assessed whether, among com-
parable samples, implementing an operational
MML was associated with reductions in
opioid positivity. Although previous studies
have suggested that MMLs are associated with
decreased opioid overdose mortality rates
at the state level,18,30 our study suggests 1
plausible mechanism underlying this associ-
ation: in states with MMLs, fewer individuals
are using opioids. If these laws are actually
causing reductions in opioid use—an expla-
nation consistent with our results—then the
hypothesis that MMLs reduce opioid-related
overdoses and treatment admissions is more
plausible. However, as states with MMLs
move toward legalizing marijuana more
broadly for recreational purposes, future
studies are needed to assess the impact these
laws may have on opioid use.
