SUMMARY
Leydig cells (LCs) play crucial roles in producing testosterone, and their dysfunction leads to male hypogonadism. LC transplantation is a
promising alternative therapy for male hypogonadism. However, the source of LCs limits this strategy for clinical applications. Here, we
report our success in reprogramming mice fibroblasts into LCs by expressing three transcriptional factors, Dmrt1, Gata4, and Nr5a1. The
induced Leydig-like cells (iLCs) expressed steroidogenic genes, had a global gene expression profile similar to that of adult LCs, and ac-
quired androgen synthesis capabilities. When iLCs were transplanted into rats or mice testes that were selectively depleted of endogenous
LCs, the transplanted cells could survive and function in the interstitium of testis, resulting in the restoration of normal levels of serum
testosterone. These findings demonstrate that the fibroblasts were able to be directly converted into iLCs by few defined factors, which
may facilitate future applications in regenerative medicine.
INTRODUCTION
Leydig cells (LCs), also known as interstitial cells of Leydig,
distribute in clusters between the seminiferous tubules in
the testicle and are the primary source of androgen in the
male body (Chen et al., 2009; Zirkin and Chen, 2000).
LCs are responsible for androgen production, and their ste-
roidogenic activities are strictly regulated by the hypothal-
amus-pituitary-gonad axis. Testosterone, referred to as the
male hormone, plays a critical role in maintaining muscle
bulk, bone health, and sexual function (Midzak et al.,
2009). Testosterone synthesis in adult LCs depends on
the pulsatile secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) by
the pituitary grand (Chen et al., 2007). LH binds LH recep-
tors (LHCGR) on the LC plasma membrane and then
activates adenylate cyclase to increase intracellular cyclic
AMP production, which further results in the rapid trans-
port of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochon-
drial membrane, mediated by steroidogenic acute regulato-
ry protein (StAR). Subsequently testosterone is synthesized
from cholesterol through a multistep process known as
steroidogenesis, catalyzed by the following four enzymes:
the cytochrome P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage
enzyme (CYP11A1), 3b-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
(HSD3B), cytochrome P450 17a-hydroxylase (CYP17A1),
and 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 (HSD17B3). It
is well documented that the expression levels of these pro-
teins are closely related to the ability of the cells to produce
testosterone (LaVoie and King, 2009).
Male hypogonadism is characterized by the low produc-
tion of testosterone, which is associated with typical symp-
toms including mood disturbance, sexual dysfunction,
decreased muscle mass and strength, and decreased bone
mineral density (Howell et al., 2000). Hypogonadism
affects approximately 30% of men aged 40–79 years and
increases in prevalence with age (Allan and McLachlan,
2004). Male hypogonadism may be caused by multiple fac-
tors, but the most important factor is LC dysfunction
(Young et al., 2000). Currently testosterone replacement
therapy is applied to treat androgen-deficient males with
primary LC failure and can achieve some alleviation of
symptoms. However, the therapy is limited by the risks of
side effects, such as reducing the rate of spermatogenesis
and increasing cardiovascular and prostate complications
(Bassil et al., 2009).
LC transplantation could be a better alternative in
providing physiological patterns of hormone for a longer
period of time (Pfeil and Dobs, 2008). However, the key
issue that restricts the use of LC transplantation is the
lack of seed cells because adult LCs do not proliferate, while
immature LCs lose their characteristics during prolonged
culture in vitro (Haider, 2004). Also, it is unrealistic
to isolate LCs from the patient’s testis. Several studies
have attempted to generate LCs by differentiating stem
cells of different sources: such as mesenchymal stem cells
(Gondo et al., 2008; Yazawa et al., 2006), embryonic
stem cells (ESCs) (Crawford et al., 1997; Jadhav and
Jameson, 2011), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)

 (Sonoyama et al., 2012). Our previous study reported that
ESC-derived Leydig-like cell has the potential to increase
serum testosterone level (Yang et al., 2014). However,
iPSC/ESC-derived cells may have ethical concerns and the
risk of tumor occurrence. Furthermore, producing iPSCs/
ESCs to treat individual patients would be time-consuming
and costly (Vassena et al., 2015). Therefore, exploring an
alternative source of LCs would be of great significance
for both basic research and clinical applications.
Recently, direct lineage reprogramming has emerged as a
promising approach for rapid and direct manipulation of
cell fates, and also has lower teratoma risks associated
with pluripotent stem cells (Rouaux and Arlotta, 2013;
Vierbuchen and Wernig, 2011). Fibroblasts are frequently
used for reprogramming studies as they can be obtained
from multiple sources with less invasive procedures. They
can be easily expanded in vitro, and provide a source of
patient-specific cells to avoid possible immunological re-
jections. Attempts have been made to directly convert fi-
broblasts into a wide array of functional cell types (Efe
et al., 2011; Marro et al., 2011; Selvaraj et al., 2010), such
as cardiomyocytes, neurons, neural progenitors, blood pro-
genitors, and hepatocyte-like cells. The generated cells were
applied in autologous cell therapy (Xu et al., 2015). Here,
we established an approach to directly convert fibroblasts
into functional LCs (induced Leydig-like cells, iLCs) via
the forced expression of defined transcriptional factors
and also used the cells to increase serum testosterone levels
of testosterone-deficient rodents.
RESULTS
Screening for Leydig Cell Reprogramming Factors
To quickly analyze the reprogram efficiency, we established
an assay system in which the induction of Leydig-like
cells from fibroblasts could be analyzed easily and quanti-
tatively by a reporter-based fluorescence-activated cell sort-
ing (FACS) procedure. To accomplish this, we infected
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with a vector carrying
the mCherry gene driven by Cyp11a1 promoter (Cyp11a1
promoter-mCherry-MEFs). Cyp11a1 encodes the choles-
terol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) that has been
shown to be selectively expressed in gonadal steroidogenic
cells (Hu et al., 1999). This tool allowed steroidogenic cells
to be separated from fibroblasts by FACS, since mCherry
could only be expressed in Cyp11a1-positive (Cyp11a1+)
cells (Figure 1A).
We used MatInspector software (Cartharius et al., 2005)
to select potential LC reprogramming factors, based on
the enrichment of their binding sites in the promoters of
several known markers of LCs (Figure S1A). Among them,
we screened 11 transcription factors (TFs), including
Dmrt1, Nr0b1, Sp1, Wt1, Nr4a1, Nr5a2, Ap1, Creb1,
Smad3, Nr5a1, and Gata4, which might have potential to
regulate LC steroidogenic gene expression. Their coding re-
gions were individually cloned into lentiviral vectors (Fig-
ures S1B and S1C) and transfected into Cyp11a1 pro-
moter-mCherry-MEFs with a same amount of lentivirus
mixture expressing all 11 factors. The mCherry-positive
(mCherry+) cells were then quantitatively analyzed by
FACS 4 days after the transfection (Figure 1A). In total,
approximately 53.01% of cells became mCherry+ and these
mCherry+ cells were capable of synthesizing testosterone
(8.46 ng/mL) (Figure 1B). These results indicated that the
forced expression of 11 transcriptional factors could repro-
gram fibroblasts into the testosterone-producing cells that
expressed a fluorescent marker driven by the promoter of
an LC marker gene, Cyp11a1. Therefore, the system was
feasible for screening essential TFs.
We next set out to narrow down the number of TFs
required for the generation of induced LCs by removing in-
dividual factors serially from the pool of 11 factors (11F).
Removing each of Ap1, Dmrt1, Gata4, or Nr5a1 signifi-
cantly decreased the reprogram efficiency while removing
each of Nr5a2, Nr4a1, Sp1, Nr0b1, or Wt1 had the potential
to decrease the percentage of mCherry+ cells compared
with the 11F group, since the differences did not reach

 statistical significance (p > 0.05). Removing Smad3 and
Creb1,
however,
did
not
change
the
proportion
of
mCherry+ cells, which suggested they were dispensable in
the reprogram (Figures 1C and 1D). The 11F minus
Smad3 and Creb1 was therefore named the nine-factor
pools (9F). The 9F were retained to conduct the next round
of screening. Lacking Nr5a2, Nr4a1, and Nr0b1 in the 9F did
not significantly change the proportion of mCherry+ cells
compared with that of 9F control; therefore, these three
genes were determined to be nonessential (Figures 1E and
1F). Subsequently, we conducted a third round of screening
by withdrawing single factors from the six-factor pools (6F)
remaining. The results indicated that removing Sp1 signif-
icantly increased the proportion of mCherry+ cells (Figures
1G and 1H), which suggests that it is nonessential in this
setting. Moreover, removing each of Ap1 or Wt1 could
slightly decrease the average efficiency, but the effects
were insignificant. Consistent with rounds 1 and 2,
removing each of Dmrt1, Gata4, or Nr5a1 from 6F signifi-
cantly decreased the reprogram efficiency from 40% to
27.7%, 23.2%, and 17.6%, respectively (Figures 1G and
1H), suggesting they are essential in reprogramming. Add-
ing Ap1 or Wt1 back to the 3F (Dmrt1, Gata4 and Nr5a1) did
not increase the number of mCherry+ cells further, con-
firming that they are also not essential in reprogramming
(Figure 1I). Interestingly, although the Cyp11a1+ cells did
not change significantly from 11F, 9F, and 6F to 3F (Fig-
ure 1J), the amount of testosterone produced by the reprog-
rammed cells with the three optimal factors (Dmrt1, Gata4,
and Nr5a1) reached 23.4 ng/mL, which was 3.1-, 2.87-, and
2.76-fold higher than that of the cells induced by 6F, 9F,
and 11F, respectively (Figure 1K), suggesting that factors
outside the 3F may have negative effects on the expressions
of other steroidogenic genes that are also required for
testosterone production. Although adding back of Ap1 or
Wt1 to 3F did not affect Cyp11a1+ cell numbers (Figure 1I),
they indeed, however, inhibited testosterone production
significantly (Figure 1K), suggesting that these two factors
may have negative effects on the expressions of other ste-
roidogenic genes other than Cyp11a1. Therefore, Dmrt1,
Gata4, and Nr5a1 represent the minimal and optimal set
of TFs (DGN) to convert fibroblasts into steroidogenic
Leydig-like cells.
Mechanism by which Dmrt1, Gata4, or Nr5a1
Converts Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts into
Leydig-like Cells
To elucidate the mechanism by which Dmrt1, Gata4, or
Nr5a1 converts fibroblasts into iLCs, we first transfected in-
dividual factors into MEFs and measured the expression
levels of several steroidogenic marker genes. We found
that the mRNA expression of Star, Cyp11a1, Hsd3b,
Cyp17a1, Hsd17b3, and Lhcgr were all upregulated signifi-
cantly in MEFs induced by Nr5a1 compared with those
of mock MEFs. In contrast, Dmrt1 and Gata4 had little
effect on steroidogenic genes except for Lhcgr (Figure 2A).
These observations were also confirmed by western blot-
ting analysis (Figure 2B).
As DNA methylation is one of the major epigenetic fac-
tors that regulates gene expression during cell-fate commit-
ment and reprogramming, the DNA methylation levels of
MEFs induced by single factor or the combinations were as-
sessed. The results demonstrated that Dmrt1, Gata4, or
Nr5a1 alone could decrease the global DNA methylation
levels of MEFs, and the combination of the three could
significantly downregulate the methylation level further
from 4.05% to 1.26% (Figure 2C). Analysis of the pro-
moter-specific methylations on individual genes after the
reprogramming indicated that the methylations of ste-
roidogenic genes may also be reduced. For example, the
percentage of methylated CpGs in the medium CpG den-
sity regions of Cyp17a1 and Lhcgr promoters was 79.3%
and 41.9% in MEFs and that in the 10-day MEFs-DGN
was 62.5% and 24.2% (p < 0.0001) (Figure 2D), suggesting
that methylated Cyp17a1 and Lhcgr promoters were partly
demethylated after reprogramming.
Subsequently, we used LH to stimulate the Leydig-like
cells induced by each of Dmrt1, Gata4, Nr5a1, or the com-
bination (DGN) and compared their testosterone produc-
tions. Cells induced by each of Dmrt1, Gata4, Nr5a1, or
DGN produced testosterone at levels of 0.21, 0.19, 12.89,
and 17.84 ng/mL, respectively (Figure 2E). These results,
in combination with the global DNA methylation studies,
suggested that Dmrt1, Gata4, and Nr5a1 may cooperate
with each other in modifying DNA methylations, upregu-
lating the expression of steroidogenic enzymes, and pro-
moting LH-mediated testosterone synthesis.
Induced Leydig-like Cells Exhibit Adult Leydig Cell
Characterizations
After transduction by the DGN factors, the cells were
cultured and then sorted by FACS at day 4 after transfection
(Figures 3A and 3B). The sorted cells were spindle shaped
(Figure S2A) and continued to develop and mature in LC
medium. The expression levels of steroidogenic genes
were evaluated by RT-PCR at day 10 after transfection.
The results showed that these examined genes were
switched on in reprogrammed cells (Figure 3C). Staining
of HSD3B enzymatic activity indicated that all iLCs were
HSD3B positive (deep purple color), which confirmed
that FACS-sorted cells also expressed HSD3B enzyme
(Figure 3D).
We next examined the expression of key steroidogenic
proteins by immunocytochemistry and western blot. The
results showed that all LC steroidogenic enzymes in the
testosterone synthetic pathway in LCs, including StAR,
42
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 8 j 39–53 j January 10, 2017
 CYP11A1, HSD3B, CYP17A1, and HSD17B3 as well as
LHCGR, were expressed at day 10 after transfection (Figures
3E and 3F). Mock-induced MEFs did not express these ste-
roidogenic enzymes (Figure S2B). Expressions of other
testicular cell marker genes, such as Dhh, Sox9, Ptgds,
Shbg, Gdnf, and Erbb4, were also analyzed in MEFs, iLCs,
adult LCs (ALCs), and primary Sertoli cells (Figure S3).
The data confirmed that the MEFs induced by DGN combi-
nation reprogrammed the cells directly toward the LC line-
age. Furthermore, the concentration of testosterone in the
supernatant of culture medium indicated that the iLCs
began to secrete testosterone by day 4 and the yield

 gradually increased, peaking at day 10 after transduction
(Figure 3G). This result indicated that these reprogram-
ming cells gained the ability to produce testosterone rather
quickly after transduction, although the optimal produc-
tions need time to develop/mature.
Transcriptome Analysis
To understand the global transcriptional changes, we
investigated the gene expression profiles of MEFs trans-
fected with null vector, iLCs, and ALCs. Hierarchical
clustering analysis demonstrated that the transcriptome
profiles of the iLCs more closely resembled those of
adult
LCs
than
MEFs.
Among
the
26,423
genes
analyzed, 3,008 genes were differentially expressed by
more than 2-fold between MEFs and iLCs, with 1,359
genes upregulated and 1,649 genes downregulated in
the iLCs (Figure 4A). Scatterplots showed that the genes
upregulated in the iLCs were significantly enriched in
LCs compared with MEFs; conversely, the downregu-
lated genes were enriched in fibroblasts (Figure 4B).
Gene ontology (GO) analysis suggested that the genes
upregulated in the iLCs were enriched in DNA replica-
tion, homologous recombination, and steroid biosyn-
thesis, which is related to the steroidogenic function
of LCs (Figure 4C).
The heatmap and qRT-PCR further revealed that the
expression of steroidogenic genes increased significantly,
including Cyp11a1, Star, Hsd3b, Cyp17a1, Hsd17b3, and
Lhcgr. In contrast, expression levels of the fibroblast
markers Thy1, Col5a2, Col6a2, S100a4, Postn, Tnc, and
Slit2 were significantly downregulated by at least 5-fold
(Figures 4D–4F). These findings indicated that treatment
with DGN did not merely activate the expression of a few
steroidogenic specific genes of LCs, but also led to a loss
of fibroblast molecular hallmarks. Taken together, these re-
sults suggest successful cell reprogramming.
DGN Bypassed Cell-Cycle Dependency during MEF
Reprogramming into iLCs
We next asked whether iLCs originated from dedifferentiat-
ing fibroblasts or arose from direct reprogramming of
the cells. We examined the reprogramming kinetics by
analyzing the expression of LC-specific genes using qRT-
PCR during 14 days of culture. Androgen synthesis-related
genes were upregulated from 2 to 10 days, and the iLCs sub-
sequently exhibited persistent, stable expression of these
genes for 14 days (Figure 5A). We subsequently examined
whether the conversion to iLCs involves passing through
a defined pluripotent stage. As expected, no expression of
the pluripotency markers Oct4, Sox2, or Nanog was detected
at day 2 after transfection (Figure 5B). In addition, these
iLCs did not show any significant changes in cell prolifera-
tion (Figure 5C). Reprogramming of the cells resulted in

 loss of cell-dividing activity from day 2, which is consistent
with loss of the expression of cell-cycle-related genes,
including cyclin A (Ccna2), cyclin B1 (Ccnb1), cyclin B2
(Ccnb2), cyclin E1 (Ccne1), and cyclin E2 (Ccne2) (Fig-
ure 5D). The cell cycle was also analyzed using propidium
iodide staining at 48 hr after transfection. As showed in Fig-
ures 5E and 5F, all of the iLCs entered into the G0/G1 phase
at day 2 after transfection. More detailed analysis by 5-bro-
modeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation showed that only
0.4% of the cells were positive for BrdU incorporation,
while MEFs scored 18.5% (Figures 5G and 5H), suggesting
that iLCs did not pass through a mitotic cell state.
Reprogramming Mice Adult Fibroblasts into iLCs
To further examine whether DGN can also convert fibro-
blasts from adult animals, we applied the same experi-
mental procedures on adult mouse tail-tip dermal fibro-
blasts (TTFs). Like the MEFs, the TTFs transfected with
DGN also expressed essential proteins for testosterone syn-
thesis (Figure S4A). Interestingly, the expression levels of
the steroidogenic genes were not consistent between the
two induced cells, with Star, Hsd3b, and Cyp17a1 being
significantly lower and Lhcgr being significantly higher in
TTF-induced cells, with Cyp11a1 and Hsd17b3 being the
same (Figure S4B). Meanwhile the fibroblast genes, such
as Col5a2, Thy1, Vimn, Postn, and S1004a, were also down-
regulated significantly in TTFs-DGN when compared with
the mock-induced TTFs (Figure S4C). Similarly, the cells
stopped proliferation after the reprogram (Figure S4D).
Moreover, TTFs-DGN were also able to synthesize and
secrete testosterone. However, the mean testosterone yield
was 19.8 ng/mL, which was lower than that of MEFs-DGN
(28.5 ng/mL) (Figure S4E). Collectively, these results indi-
cate that the fibroblasts from both fetal and adult sources
(MEFs or TTFs) could be reprogrammed to functional
Leydig-like cells by DGN.

 Intratesticular Transplantation of iLCs and
Restoration of Serum Testosterone Level
To determine whether iLCs can survive and function
in vivo, we transplanted these cells into the testis of rats
treated
with
ethylene
dimethanesulfonate
(EDS)
(an
androgen deficiency model) (Figure 6A). Consistent with
our earlier experiment results (Yang et al., 2014), H&E
staining showed that EDS could specifically eliminate the
LCs in adult rat testes (Figure S5A) and led to a dramatic
decline in serum testosterone levels 7 days after EDS treat-
ment (Figure 6B). In the EDS-treated model animals, serum
testosterone began to increase by 14 days, and by 28 days

 serum testosterone was recovered to about 25% of control.
Implantation of MEF cells did not change the recovery pro-
cess significantly. However, implantation of iLCs dramati-
cally improved the recovery process, and by 28 days the
serum testosterone concentration reached the normal con-
trol level (Figure 6C).
Testosterone plays an important role in maintaining
normal body and reproductive organ weights. At 14 days
after exposure to EDS, the body and testes weights of ani-
mals were dramatically decreased. By day 28 after trans-
plantation, the body and testes weights significantly
increased in the iLC-treated group compared with the
model and rats receiving MEFs (Figure 6D).
As MEFs and iLCs expressed GFP, we used fluorescent
tracer techniques to investigate whether iLCs possess the
characteristic potential of migrating into interstitial re-
gions of the testis. Meanwhile, histological evaluations
were performed on testes sections at 14 and 28 days after
transplantation to confirm whether the GFP-positive cells
expressed LC steroidogenic markers. The results showed
that iLCs were localized exclusively in the interstitium of
the testes and expressed the LC steroidogenic markers
CYP11A1 and CYP17A1 (Figures S5B and S5C). Impor-
tantly, these iLCs could survive at least 28 days in vivo (Fig-
ure 6E), which demonstrated that they successfully inte-
grated into the host niche. Although the animals that
received MEF transplantation also showed that MEFs
were capable of localizing in the interstitium of the testes,
these cells did not express the steroidogenic enzymes
CYP11A1 and CYP17A1.
To further confirm the function of iLCs, we also trans-
planted iLCs into EDS-treated mice testes, a partial
androgen
deficiency
model,
as
previously
described
(Jiang et al., 2014). Adult mice were treated with EDS
(400 mg/kg) and then iLCs were injected into the paren-
chyma at the cranial pole of the testis 1 day later (Figure 7A).
In the EDS-treated control group, the expression of LC
marker genes Hsd3b and Hsd17b3 as well as the concentra-
tion of testosterone were dramatically reduced by 81.5%
6 days after EDS treatment. Consistent with the observa-
tions in rats, the transplanted iLCs were also localized
exclusively in the interstitium of the testis and expressed
the LC-specific markers CYP11A1 and CYP17A1 at day
12 (Figure 7B). Moreover, they exhibited significantly
increased mRNA expression levels of Hsd3b and Hsd17b3,
while serum testosterone concentrations and expression
levels of StAR were significantly increased and restored to
normal control levels 12 days after iLC transplantation
(Figures 7C–7G), which is a much faster rate than is seen
in rats. The difference could be due to the fact that EDS
treatment cannot completely eliminate endogenous LCs.
However, the results demonstrated that, just as in rats,
the transplanted iLCs in mice have acquired key properties
of ALCs as they are capable of colonizing the interstitium
and have the potential to restore the serum testosterone
level when transplanted into the testes where local LCs
are partially depleted.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we first identified a cocktail of transcriptional
factors (Dmrt1, Gata4, and Nr5a1) from 11 candidates and
were able to convert fibroblasts into iLCs directly by the
three factors. Remarkably, the steroidogenic genes ap-
peared in reprogrammed cells, iLCs, at day 2, in contrast
to cells differentiated from iPSCs, which typically exhibit
this behavior from days 10 to 20 (Takahashi et al.,
2007b). In addition, these iLCs quickly exited the cell cycle
as early as day 2 after transduction, which suggested that
the transformation of iLCs from fibroblasts was direct and
bypassed a proliferative intermediate, and did not depend
on the generation of iPSCs. In comparison with previous
methods of staged differentiation to derive tissue-specific
somatic cells from ESCs (Yang et al., 2014) or iPSCs (So-
noyama et al., 2012), the direct reprogramming methods
described here could eliminate the possibility of teratoma
formation and are devoid of ethical and legal concerns.
It is well known that Nr5a1 is an essential factor for LC
development and survival (Shima et al., 2011). Overexpres-
sion of Nr5a1 has been shown to be capable of promoting
ESCs into Leydig-like cells (Karpova et al., 2015). In this
study, Nr5a1 also seemed to be sufficient, by itself, to
induce Leydig-like features, but the additional expression
of Dmrt1 and Gata4 could significantly increase the effi-
ciency of iLCs and testosterone production. Moreover, for
the cocktail containing the three factors Dmrt1, Gata4,
and Nr5a1, removal of any one could reduce the induction
efficiency and testosterone production dramatically. These
results suggested that Dmrt1, Gata4, and Nr5a1 showed a
positive synergistic regulation of LC steroidogenic gene
expression. Dmrt1 is essential in triggering testis-deter-
mining process in fetal development in mammals, main-
taining mammalian testis determination, and competing
regulatory networks to maintain testis identity long after
the fetal choice between male and female is made (Ieda
et al., 2010; Padua et al., 2015). Nr5a1 and Gata4, on the
other hand, played pivotal roles in LC development and
functions, and also were key regulators of luteal steroido-
genesis and required for the normal response of luteal cells
to LH (Convissar et al., 2015; Kyro
¨nlahti et al., 2011).
In the EDS-treated rat model, the implantation of iLCs
induced by either DGN or Nr5a1 alone was able to increase
the serum testosterone concentration by day 28 after trans-
plantation. However, the serum testosterone concentra-
tion in MEFs transfected with Nr5a1 alone was significantly

 lower than that of MEFs transfected with DGN or the
normal control (Figure S6). The results of the experiment
in vitro indicated that Dmrt1 and Gata4 could activate
the expression of Lhcgr, which is the critical step of
androgen synthesis. These results suggested that Dmrt1,
Gata4, and Nr5a1 cooperated to promote programming
and steroidogenesis.
To study the mechanisms by which DGN convert fibro-
blasts into iLCs, we investigated the DNA methylation
levels of MEFs induced by Dmrt1, Gata4, and Nr5a1 alone
or in combination. Because the rearrangement of DNA
methylation patterns is essential for successful somatic
cell reprogramming (Huang and Fan, 2010; Messerschmidt
et al., 2014), demethylation is required for silencing trans-
duced retroviral promoters and activating endogenous
genes (Hu et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014). As expected,
the endogenous MEF genome showed higher levels of
DNA methylation than that of the iLC genome. Dmrt1,
Gata4, and Nr5a1 alone could decrease the global DNA
methylation levels, and the combination of the three fac-
tors could decrease it further. Importantly, DGN combina-
tion was also able to decrease the methylation level of

 steroidogenic genes (Cyp17a1 and Lhcgr) promoter. The
mechanism involved might be that these factors opened
the chromatin structure in the Leydig loci and induced
epigenetic resetting of the fibroblast genome, allowing
other Leydig-specific TFs to reach the target sites and lead-
ing to a full activation of the LC program. Thus, the roles
of Dmrt1 and Gata4 in iLC reprogramming could be
increasing not just the expression of Lhcgr but also the
levels of DNA demethylation. The precise regulatory mech-
anisms of DGN in gene methylation deserve further
investigation.
Besides MEFs, we also tested the effectiveness of the
cocktail in reprogramming fibroblast from adult animals
(TTFs). Interestingly, although the expected reprogram-
ming indeed happened in TTF-derived cells, which showed
LC characteristics, the gene expression levels and steroido-
genic capabilities did not reach to the same levels as that of
MEF-derived iLCs. Indeed, cells from adult animals (TTFs)
might have less plasticity in reprogramming than the fetal
cells (MEFs) (Pang et al., 2011). It is possible that TTFs
possess higher levels of DNA methylation and are prone
to undergo more complex processes than MEFs during re-
programming. It has been documented that age-associated
hypermethylation in differentiated tissues often overlaps
with promoters of genes that encode TFs necessary for
differentiation or transdifferentiation, while these genes
are deregulated in younger cells, which affects plasticity
(Jung and Pfeifer, 2015; Zampieri et al., 2015).
To evaluate the therapeutic function of iLCs in vivo, we
used two types of animal models, androgen deficiency
and partial androgen deficiency syndrome, with complete
loss of LCs in EDS-treated rat testis and partial loss of LCs
in EDS-treated mice testis. Compared with other organs,
testis is immunologically privileged (Meinhardt and Hedg-
er, 2011). It has been reported that allogeneic and xenoge-
neic pancreatic islets survived transplantation in the testis
with little immunosuppression (Bellgrau and Selawry,
1990). Our preliminary study also demonstrated that
mouse ESC-derived Leydig-like cells were able to be trans-
planted into the testes of rats and survive. Therefore, we
transplanted iLCs into the testes of rats and mice. The re-
sults showed that iLCs were capable of restoring the serum
testosterone concentrations to the normal control levels in
both rat and mouse models. Interestingly, it took more
than 3 weeks to fully recover serum testosterone in rat,
compared with only took 2 weeks in mice. In addition to
the difference in the severity of endogenous LC loss, it is
also possible that allogeneic cells are more adaptive to the
niche of mouse testis (Selawry and Whittington, 1984).
Nevertheless, these results indicated that allogeneic and
xenogeneic iLCs could survive in the testes in both
species and that this characteristic may be beneficial for
clinical use.
In summary, by screening multiple transcriptional fac-
tors, we have found three transcriptional factors: Nr5a1,
Dmrt1, and Gata4, which are essential in inducing the tran-
sition of fibroblasts (MEFs or TTFs) into functional Leydig-
like cells. The gene expression profile and steroidogenic
characteristics of iLCs were closely matched to those of
ALCs. Importantly, these iLCs have the powerful capacity
to restore the serum testosterone level when transplanted
into the testes of rats or mice with testosterone deficiency.
Our finding provides a potential approach to produce
Leydig-like cells with steroidogenic function for cell ther-
apy of male androgen-deficient diseases in humans.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
C57BL/6 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats (at 8 weeks of age)
were obtained from the experimental animal center of Guangdong
Province,
China.
All
animals
were
kept
under
conditions
with controlled temperature (24�C ± 1�C), relative humidity
(50%–60%), and a light/dark cycle of 12:12 hr. The standard rodent
diet and drinking water were freely accessible. All surgical proced-
ures and postoperative care were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Jinan University.
Cell Culture and Derivation of iLCs
MEFs and TTFs were isolated and cultured as previously described
(Qian et al., 2013; Takahashi et al., 2007a). In brief, MEFs were
prepared from 13.5 days post coitum embryos. The head and
visceral tissues were carefully removed from the embryos, and the
remaining tissues were minced with a pair of forceps and incubated
in a solution containing 0.25% trypsin and 1 mM EDTA for 10 min
at 37�C. After the trypsinization, MEFs medium DMEM containing
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies), 2 mM L-gluta-
mine, and penicillin/streptomycin (all from Life Technologies)
were added and pipetted to dissociate the tissue fragments. The
triturated cells were collected by centrifugation (250 3 g for
5 min) and resuspended in MEFs medium. The cells were plated
on 10-cm tissue culture dishes and grown in medium for 2–3 days
at 37�C under 5% CO2 before freezing. TTFs were prepared from
adult male mice. After washing with PBS, a lengthwise incision
was made in the harvested tail by an injection needle. The superfi-
cial dermis was then peeled and the remaining tail was minced into
1-cm pieces with scissors. Two pieces were placed per well of
gelatin-coated 6-well plates, and 2 mL DMEM containing 10%
FBS and penicillin/streptomycin was added and incubated at
37�C for 5 days, during which time the fibroblasts migrated out
of the tails. The tissues of tails were removed with sterile forceps
and discarded. The medium was replaced with 2 mL fresh medium,
and the cells cultured until they reached confluence. The medium
was aspirated and washed twice with 2 mL of PBS, then 0.3 mL of
0.25% trypsin/1 mM EDTA was added before incubation at 37�C
for 3 min. Two milliliters of DMEM containing 10% FBS was
then added, and the cells suspended and transferred to a 15-mL
tube for centrifugation at 250 3 g for 5 min. The supernatant was

 discarded and the cells resuspended with 10 mL of medium before
being plated on a 100-mm tissue culture dish and passaged to new
100-mm dishes at 1:4 dilution. These cells usually become
confluent within 3–4 days. For the generation of iLC cells, MEFs
and TTFs were used within three passages to avoid replicative
senescence.
To derive iLCs, we originally passaged MEFs and TTFs onto
gelatin-coated tissue culture plates. Cells were incubated with
lentivirus for 12 hr, after which infected MEFs were switched to
Leydig reprogramming media containing DMEM with 10% embry-
onic stem cell-qualified FBS, 1% Glutamax, 1% nonessential amino
acids (all from Life Technologies), 50 ng/mL insulin-like growth
factor, and 10 ng/mL platelet-derived growth factor AA (R&D Sys-
tems) at 37�C under 5% CO2, and culture medium was changed
every 2 days.
Cell Transplantation
Before transplantation, male Sprague-Dawley rats were adminis-
tered a single intraperitoneal injection of EDS, which was syn-
thesized as previously described (Jackson and Jackson, 1984; Tah-
taoui et al., 2004) and dissolved in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) at a
dose of 100 mg/kg body weight. Mice were treated at a dose of
400 mg/kg. Transplantation was then performed as previously
described (Ge et al., 2006) with some modifications. In brief, iLC
(grown on 100-mm plates) at day 4 were washed twice with PBS
and incubated with 0.25% trypsin/1 mM EDTA for 2 min at
37�C. Cells were gently dissociated, resuspended manually, and
collected in a 15-mL Falcon tube. Cells were rinsed twice with
PBS following centrifugation at 200 3 g for 5 min. Finally each pel-
let was resuspended in PBS for transplantation. Cells were loaded
into a 1-mL syringe for injection into the testis of adult Sprague-
Dawley male rats or mice that had been treated with EDS. Approx-
imately 2 3 106 cells in a 50-mL volume of PBS were injected into
the parenchyma of recipient testes 7 days after the rats received
EDS, and 106 cells in a 20-mL volume of PBS were injected into
the parenchyma of recipient testes 24 hr after the mice received
EDS. The control animals for the experimental group were EDS-
treated rats that had received a testicular injection of the PBS
vehicle. Testes from all animals were examined at 7 and 14 days
after transplantation (days 14 and 28 after EDS).
Statistical Analyses
All experiments were repeated at least three times unless otherwise
specified, and data were expressed as the mean ± 1 SD around the
mean. Statistical analyses were performed with an unpaired Stu-
dent’s t test or one-way ANOVA for more than two groups. A
two-tailed value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
