IMPORTANCE Although breastfeeding has a positive effect on an infant’
s health and
development, the prevalence is low in many communities. The effect of financial incentives
to improve breastfeeding prevalence is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To assess the effect of an area-level financial incentive for breastfeeding on
breastfeeding prevalence at 6 to 8 weeks post partum.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Nourishing Start for Health (NOSH) trial, a cluster
randomized trial with 6 to 8 weeks follow-up, was conducted between April 1, 2015, and
March 31, 2016, in 92 electoral ward areas in England with baseline breastfeeding prevalence
at 6 to 8 weeks post partum less than 40%. A total of 10 010 mother-infant dyads resident in
the 92 study electoral ward areas where the infant’
s estimated or actual birth date fell
between February 18, 2015, and February 17, 2016, were included. Areas were randomized to
the incentive plus usual care (n = 46) (5398 mother-infant dyads) or to usual care alone
(n = 46) (4612 mother-infant dyads).
INTERVENTIONS Usual care was delivered by clinicians (mainly midwives, health visitors) in a
variety of maternity, neonatal, and infant feeding services, all of which were implementing
the UNICEF UK Baby Friendly Initiative standards. Shopping vouchers worth £40 (US$50)
were offered to mothers 5 times based on infant age (2 days, 10 days, 6-8 weeks, 3 months,
6 months), conditional on the infant receiving any breast milk.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was electoral ward area-level 6- to
8-week breastfeeding period prevalence, as assessed by clinicians at the routine 6- to 8-week
postnatal check visit. Secondary outcomes were area-level period prevalence for
breastfeeding initiation and for exclusive breastfeeding at 6 to 8 weeks.
RESULTS In the intervention (5398 mother-infant dyads) and control (4612 mother-infant
dyads) group, the median (interquartile range) percentage of women aged 16 to 44 years was
36.2% (3.0%) and 37.4% (3.6%) years, respectively. After adjusting for baseline
breastfeeding prevalence and local government area and weighting to reflect unequal
cluster-level breastfeeding prevalence variances, a difference in mean 6- to 8-week
breastfeeding prevalence of 5.7 percentage points (37.9% vs 31.7%; 95% CI for adjusted
difference, 2.7% to 8.6%; P < .001) in favor of the intervention vs usual care was observed.
No significant differences were observed for the mean prevalence of breastfeeding initiation
(61.9% vs 57.5%; adjusted mean difference, 2.9 percentage points; 95%, CI, −0.4 to 6.2;
P = .08) or the mean prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding at 6 to 8 weeks (27.0% vs 24.1%;
adjusted mean difference, 2.3 percentage points; 95% CI, −0.2 to 4.8; P = .07).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Financial incentives may improve breastfeeding rates in areas
with low baseline prevalence. Offering a financial incentive to women in areas of England
with breastfeeding rates below 40% compared with usual care resulted in a modest but
statistically significant increase in breastfeeding prevalence at 6 to 8 weeks. This was
measured using routinely collected data.

reastfeeding is associated with a positive effect on an
infant’
slifechances,survival,development,andhealth,
including protection against childhood infections, obe-
sity, and diabetes; nursing women are also protected against
breast cancer.1,2 The importance of breastfeeding in promot-
ing health and development is reflected in national and inter-
national policy recommendations and guidance.3,4 However,
there are considerable long-standing social and cultural bar-
riers to breastfeeding in many settings. Breastfeeding in many
countries is sexualized in public discourse and the media, re-
sulting in a powerful disincentive to breastfeed mediated
through embarrassment and fear.5 Breastfeeding prevalence
has been low in many low-income communities in high-
income countries for generations. Over the past 25 years,
breastfeeding rates in such communities have not risen in re-
sponse to a range of policy developments,6,7 and no trials of
support interventions have been effective in increasing breast-
feeding prevalence.8
There is increasing interest in the role of financial incen-
tive programs to meet the health needs of children9 and fi-
nancial incentives are increasingly being used to improve
maternal and newborn health.10-14 However, evidence as to
whether financial incentives are effective in increasing breast-
feeding prevalence is weak.15,16 Although incentives that sup-
port breastfeeding are being implemented (eg, women in
France are given paid breastfeeding breaks during the work-
ing day),11 incentives that support infant formula are also being
implemented (eg, the UK national statutory scheme [Healthy
Start]providesvouchersof£6.20[US$7.75]perweekinthefirst
year that can be exchanged for infant formula for women in
receipt of welfare payments, many of whom live in areas with
low breastfeeding prevalence). The objective of the Nourish-
ing Start for Health (NOSH) cluster randomized trial was to as-
sess the effects of an area-level financial incentive scheme for
breastfeedingonbreastfeedingprevalenceat6to8weekspost-
partum in areas with historically low (<40%) breastfeeding
rates at 6 to 8 weeks post partum.

Thus,consenttotakepartinthetrialwasobtainedfromlocalgov-
ernment areas and the leads for infant feeding services in these

understood to be implicit consent to take part in the research.
Study Site and Participants
Mother-infant dyads were eligible for the financial incentive
if the estimated (or actual) infant birth date fell between Feb-
ruary 18, 2015, and February 17, 2016 (hence, the infant would
be aged 6 weeks between April 1, 2015, and March 31, 2016),
and their mother was 16 years or older and lived within an in-
tervention electoral ward area.
Randomization
Electoral ward areas (not individuals) were randomly allo-
cated to intervention or control using a 1:1 cluster random al-
location sequence with stratification at local government area
level (with randomly selected block size of 2 or 4). A statisti-
cian (one of us, S.J.W.), who was blinded to ward names, used
a computer-generated random sequence allocation method.
Intervention
Key elements of the financial incentive intervention were de-
veloped with local clinicians, commissioners, and communi-
ties during the pretrial feasibility study.18,19 Women in the in-
tervention clusters were informed about the scheme and
invited to join by clinicians (mainly midwives and health visi-
tors). A web-app–facilitated postal address eligibility check-
ing and a booklet describing the scheme were made available
tocliniciansanddistributedtochildren’
scentersandotherpub-
lic places. The booklet described the benefits of breastfeed-
ing, identified sources of infant feeding support, and de-
scribed the vouchers as “a way of acknowledging the value of
breastfeeding to babies, mums, and society, and the effort in-
volved in breastfeeding.” The booklet informed women that
the “NOSH Scheme is being tested by researchers.” Initial up-
take of the scheme was slower than in the pretrial feasibility
study, as many women had not heard about the plan; there-
fore, from trial month 4, banner posters were put in hospital
waiting rooms, social media (Facebook) advertisements were
posted to women in the intervention areas, and from month
6, 4 clinicians were employed part-time to disseminate infor-
mation to local infant feeding services.
The incentive intervention was offered to women condi-
tional on their infant receiving any breast milk. The scheme
offered shopping vouchers worth £40 (US$50) 5 times based
on infant age: 2 days, 10 days, 6 to 8 weeks, 3 months, and 6
months (ie, up to £200/US$250 in total). Vouchers were ex-
changeable at supermarkets and other retail shops with no re-
striction on allowable purchases. Receipt of vouchers was con-
ditional on mothers signing a form stating that “my baby is
Key Points
Question Does offering financial incentives for breastfeeding
increase breastfeeding at 6 to 8 weeks post partum in areas with
low (<40%) breastfeeding prevalence?
Findings In this cluster randomized clinical trial that included
10 010 mother-infant dyads in England, randomization of electoral
ward areas to a financial incentive for breastfeeding compared
with usual care resulted in a modest but significantly greater
prevalence of breastfeeding at 6 to 8 weeks (37.9% vs 31.7%).
Meaning Financial incentives may improve breastfeeding rates in
areas with a low baseline prevalence.

 receiving breast milk” and a countersignature from a clini-
cian for the statement “I have discussed breastfeeding with
mum today.”
Clinicians were asked to notify the research team confi-
dentially if they had a concern that an infant was not receiv-
ing breast milk without the claim being jeopardized. Mothers’
mailed claim forms, claims, and verification of clinicians’sig-
natures were processed independently of the research team.
Financial incentives were delivered directly to mothers either
as vouchers or prepaid gift cards.
Usual Care
The incentive scheme was offered in addition to usual care for
all women in all areas. Usual care was delivered by midwives,
health visitors, and breastfeeding peer supporters working in
a variety of maternity, neonatal, and infant feeding services.
All hospitals and community services had UNICEF UK Baby
Friendly Initiative accreditation and were implementing the
UNICEF UK Baby Friendly Initiative standards.
End Point and Data Collection
The primary end point was routinely collected electoral ward
area-level period prevalence of any breastfeeding (ie, exclu-
siveornonexclusive)at6to8weekspostpartumbetweenApril
1, 2015, and March 31, 2016. Area-level 6- to 8-week breast-
feeding prevalence is a UK national public health outcome
measure.20 Two secondary outcomes were included for the
same period as the primary outcome: the period prevalence
of breastfeeding initiation and exclusive breastfeeding at 6 to
8 weeks. All area-level data were collected routinely (and in-
dependentlyofthetrial)bythosedeliveringroutineinfantfeed-
ing services (midwives, health visitors, and primary care phy-
sicians) and collated by the local National Health Service Trust,
Local Authority, or Child Health Information team. The pro-
tocol specified collection of individual-level secondary out-
comes to inform a cost-effectiveness analysis (duration of ex-
clusiveandanybreastfeeding,andthenumberofconsultations
withcliniciansconcerninggastrointestinalinfection,otitisme-
dia, respiratory tract infections, and atopic eczema), but it was
not possible to obtain these data.
Statistical Analysis
Theoriginalsamplesizecalculation17assumedthatindividual-
level mother-infant feeding status outcome data would be col-
lected using a questionnaire; however, in the pretrial feasibil-
ity stage, it became clear that this method would lead to poor
estimates due to respondent bias. Therefore, routinely col-
lected electoral ward area-level breastfeeding prevalence data
were used. The unit of analysis was the electoral ward area,
and breastfeeding prevalence was treated as a continuous out-
come. A sample size calculation based on a baseline mean (SD)
area-level 6- to 8-week prevalence of 28.2% (6.9%), a power
of 80%, and a 2-sided significance level of 5% determined that
47 areas per trial group would be required to detect a 4 per-
centagepointdifferencebetweeninterventionandcontrol(this
was the smallest effect size that it was feasible to study given
resource constraints).
We gained local stakeholder consent to conduct the trial
in 170 electoral ward areas (average population, 9500). These
sites were situated in 5 adjacent local government areas in the
north of England (Bassetlaw, Doncaster, North Derbyshire,
Rotherham, and Sheffield). Of these 170 electoral ward areas,
92 had a 6- to 8-week breastfeeding prevalence of less than
40%, based on the most recent area-level breastfeeding data
available, and were included in the trial.
For our main analysis of the primary outcome measure,
a weighted multiple linear regression model was used to es-
timate the intervention effect after controlling for baseline
breastfeeding prevalence and local government area. Weights
were calculated using the method of Donner and Klar21 and
were based on an intraclass correlation coefficient estimated
from the data using the method of Fleiss and Cuzick.22
The primary analysis was by intention-to-treat at the elec-
toral ward area (cluster) level. Electoral ward area-level breast-
feeding prevalences were calculated on a complete case basis
in which the denominator was the number of infants with
known breastfeeding status; infants for whom we had miss-
ing outcome data were not included in the analysis.
Weconductedthefollowingsecondaryanalysesforourpri-
mary outcome. First, we calculated the unweighted, unad-
justed effect size and tested for significance using an indepen-
dent samples t test. Second, we calculated the effect size using

To explore how the effectiveness of the intervention
evolved over time as knowledge of the scheme increased, we
calculated the effect size using the same regression model as

Forthesecondaryoutcomesofbreastfeedinginitiationand
6- to 8-week exclusive breastfeeding, we estimated the inter-
vention effect using a weighted linear regression with adjust-
ment for local government area and baseline prevalence. Due
to unavailability of electoral ward area-level data on either of
the secondary outcomes, we used the baseline 6- to 8-week
breastfeeding prevalence as a proxy measure in each case.
Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS, version
21 (SAS Institute) and R, version 3.4.1 (R Foundation). All tests
were 2-sided with a significance threshold of 5%.
Results
Table 1 describes the baseline characteristics of the 92 inter-
vention and control wards. A flowchart is presented in Figure 1.
During the intervention period, 10 010 infants were due for a
6- to 8-week postnatal check (n = 5398 intervention, n = 4612
control). The mean area-level deprivation scores were higher
(more deprived) than the mean for England (21.7).
During the trial, 2496 of 5398 (46.2%) eligible infant-
mother dyads registered with the scheme, and claims for
vouchers were submitted by mothers for 2179 (40.4%) of all
eligible infants (including 25 sets of twins). Voucher claims at
6to8weeks(thetimeforthetrialprimaryoutcome)weremade
for 1827 (33.8%) of all eligible infants, and by the end of the
6-month scheme mothers had claimed 1 or more vouchers for
2179 (40.4%) of all eligible infants (Table 2).
Almost all claims (8239 [96.2%]) were countersigned by
midwives or health visitors; other signatories included nurses,
primary care physicians, pediatricians, nursery nurses, breast-
feeding support workers, and midwife support workers (528
signatories in total). During the trial, clinicians signing claims
forms were asked to report any concerns they had that an in-
fant was not receiving breast milk without the voucher claim
being invalidated. It was not known whether the potential to
receive an incentive led to inaccurate self-reporting by moth-
ers to their clinicians. To assess the veracity of the claims and
the outcome data, information was analyzed from all con-
tacts with clinicians involved in delivering the intervention to
2179 eligible mother-infant dyads who claimed vouchers. This
included 42 group meetings, 418 telephone calls with the
scheme administrators, and 35 researcher-led qualitative in-
terviews. Clinicians reported 19 cases with which they had
some uncertainty as to whether the infant was receiving breast
milk.
There were 803 (8.0%) infants for whom no 6- to 8-week
infant feeding status was recorded, the majority of whom (762
[94.9%]) were from 1 local government area (Rotherham). The
proportion of missing data was 7.9% (425 of 5398) in the in-
tervention group and 8.2% (378 of 4612) in the control group
(χ2 = 0.31, P = .58).
The primary outcome—mean cluster-level 6- to 8-week
breastfeeding period prevalence—for April 1, 2015, to March 31,
2016, was 31.7% (95% CI, 29.4-34.0) in control areas and 37.9%
(95% CI, 35.0-40.8) in intervention areas (Table 3). The trial
resultedinacrudeunweightedincreaseinbreastfeedingpreva-

58.8% to 64.5%) in intervention areas. There was no signifi-
cant difference between intervention and control groups
(mean, 4.1 percentage point difference; 95% CI, −0.4 to 8.6;
P = .07). After weighting and adjusting for local government
area and baseline 6- to 8-week breastfeeding prevalence (as a

P = .07). The intraclass correlation coefficient for exclusive
breastfeeding prevalence was 0.018.
Discussion
Compared with usual care alone, the offer of a financial in-
centive in addition to usual care resulted in a 5.7 percentage
point increase in breastfeeding prevalence at 6 to 8 weeks in
areaswithlowbreastfeedingprevalence.Basedonameanbase-
line prevalence of 28.2%, this represents a relative increase in
prevalenceof20.2%.Althoughthereisnoconsensusastowhat
constitutes a significant increase in breastfeeding areas with
low prevalence, experts in our pretrial consultation thought
that any increase would be of value.
Toourknowledge,thiswasthefirsttrialofafinancialincen-
tive for breastfeeding offered at a community (area) level. The
largestpublishedtrialofaninterventiontoincreasebreastfeed-
ing (Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative PROBIT trial)24 detected
asimilareffectsizeat6to8weeks(6.0%);however,ourtrialwas
notconductedinhospitalsbutincommunitieswithmuchlower
mean 6- to 8-week breastfeeding prevalence (28.2% compared
with 85%), and usual care in these communities (and the hos-
pitals in these communities) already included the PROBIT trial
intervention (Baby Friendly standards25).
Social support and social interventions (eg, financial in-
centives) can influence health-related behaviors by transform-
ing unhealthy behaviors into healthy behaviors that are wit-
nessed, actively encouraged, and rewarded, and healthy
behavior goals are shared.26 Because social relationships play
keyrolesinsupportingandprotectingwomenwhobreastfeed,2
it was hypothesized that offering the intervention to commu-
nities would help to communicate the value of breastfeeding
and have a positive influence on those who support women,
and thus address some of the complex, financial, organiza-
tional, and cultural barriers that limit breastfeeding. Despite
financial incentives for breastfeeding being viewed as conten-
tious by some,27 almost half (46.2%) of all eligible women
joined the scheme.
A recent small trial of financial incentives28 that enrolled
36 low-income breastfeeding women in the US Women In-
fant and Children program verified breastfeeding using di-
rect observation by research staff. Women in our target popu-
lation lived in communities in which breastfeeding was not the
norm and rarely observed in public. To determine the most ap-
propriate and acceptable method for breastfeeding verifica-
tion for the area-level intervention, the project team engaged
in extensive pretrial consultation and feasibility testing with
local women, health care providers, public health leads, and
service commissioners.18,29 There was no reliable and practi-
cal biochemical method of verifying that an infant is breast-
fed, and strong concerns were voiced that seeking direct proof
ofbreastfeeding(eg,throughobservationofafeed)wouldhave
a negative effect on the relationship between clinicians and
women.18,29 We therefore used the method by which infant
feeding status is recorded for the purposes of routine data col-
lection in the UK’
s National Health Service: a clinician’
s as-
sessment based on their interactions with the mother during
routine visits at birth and 6 to 8 weeks postpartum (which in-
cludes discussions about feeding and may or may not include
witnessing the mother breastfeed).
Limitations
This trial has a number of limitations. First, we used the pre-
existing country-wide data system that collects information
on breastfeeding prevalence at 6 to 8 weeks for public health
monitoring purposes that is based on clinician report; how-
ever, these reports are not checked for validity. During the trial,
mothers in the intervention arm had a financial incentive to
report to clinicians that their baby was receiving breast milk
and no feasible way was found to verify the truth of these re-
ports. Although clinicians were given the opportunity to
report doubts about the veracity of maternal self-report, notes
of clinician doubt were rare. This low level may have been be-
cause filing a report would require extra paperwork or might
in some way jeopardize the clinician-mother relationship. Fu-
ture studies of financial incentives for breastfeeding may need
to develop objective tests (eg, biochemical markers) to pro-
vide objective confirmation of breastfeeding. Second, data on
area level breastfeeding prevalence were obtainable only for
2 points (initiation and 6-8 weeks). Although data on voucher
claims were collected at 5 points (including 3 and 6 months),
these data cannot be a proxy for breastfeeding rates, as the nu-
merator excludes breastfed babies for whom claims were not
made. Third, without the cost-effectiveness of the trial inter-
vention, it is not possible to determine the full impact of the
behavioral and clinical findings for future public health policy.
Lastly, as the effect size increased over the 4 quarters of the
trial,thissuggeststhattheoveralleffectonbreastfeedingpreva-
lence might have been greater if the trial had tested the inter-
vention over a longer period.
Conclusions
Financial incentives may improve breastfeeding rates in areas
with a low baseline prevalence. Among women in areas of En-
gland with breastfeeding rates below 40%, randomization of
electoral ward areas to a financial incentive for breastfeeding
compared with usual care resulted in a modest but statisti-
cally significant increase in breastfeeding prevalence at 6 to 8
weeks. This outcome was measured using routinely col-
lected data. Research is indicated to explore the feasibility of
objectively assessing breastfeeding behavior for future finan-
cial incentive studies.
