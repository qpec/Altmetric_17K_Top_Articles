Summary 
RNAs present in mature mammalian sperm are delivered to the zygote at fertilization, 
where they have the potential to affect early development. The biogenesis of the small 
RNA payload of mature sperm is therefore of great interest, as it may be a target of 
signaling pathways linking paternal conditions to offspring phenotype. Recent studies 
have suggested the surprising hypothesis that the small RNA payload carried by mature 
sperm may include RNAs that were not synthesized during testicular spermatogenesis, 
but that are instead delivered to sperm during the process of post-testicular maturation 
in the epididymis. To further test this hypothesis, we characterized small RNA dynamics 
during testicular and post-testicular germ cell maturation in mice. We show that purified 
testicular germ cell populations, including mature testicular spermatozoa, carry 
extremely low levels of tRNA fragments (tRFs), and that tRFs become highly abundant 
only after sperm have entered the epididiymis. The process of small RNA delivery to 
sperm can be recapitulated in vitro, as caput epididymosomes deliver small RNAs 
including tRFs and microRNAs to mature testicular spermatozoa. Finally, to definitively 
identify the tissue of origin for small RNAs in sperm, we carried out tissue-specific 
metabolic labeling of RNAs in intact mice, finding that mature sperm carry small RNAs 
that were originally synthesized in the somatic cells of the epididymis. Taken together, 
our data demonstrates that soma-germline small RNA transfer occurs in male 
mammals, most likely via vesicular transport from the epididymis to maturing sperm.

INTRODUCTION 
Inheritance of phenotypic changes in the absence of any change in DNA is known as 
epigenetic inheritance, and is essential for cell state inheritance during mitosis. 
Epigenetic information is not only inherited during cell division, but at least some 
epigenetic information can be transmitted from one generation to the next in 
multicellular organisms, a mechanistically complex process that requires epigenetic 
information to be maintained throughout the disruptive processes of gametogenesis, 
fertilization, and early embryonic development. Although decades of study of cell state 
inheritance and other cases of epigenetic inheritance have identified several major 
molecular conduits of epigenetic information – chromatin structure, small RNAs, DNA 
modifications, prions, and transcription factors – much remains to be understood 
regarding the establishment and erasure of epigenetic information during 
gametogenesis and early development.  
Small (<40 nt) RNAs are one of the best-established carriers of epigenetic 
information, and play key roles in epigenetic inheritance paradigms in C. elegans (Fire 
et al., 1998), A. thaliana (Arteaga-Vazquez and Chandler, 2010; Hamilton and 
Baulcombe, 1999; Zilberman et al., 2003), S. pombe (Volpe et al., 2002), D. 
melanogaster (Brennecke et al., 2008; de Vanssay et al., 2012), and mammals (Chen et 
al., 2016; Gapp et al., 2014; Rassoulzadegan et al., 2006; Rodgers et al., 2015; Sharma 
et al., 2016). Multiple distinct families of small RNAs have been described which differ 
from one another in their biogenesis and in their regulatory functions, and include well-
studied species such as microRNAs, endo-siRNAs, and the gamete-enriched class of 
piRNAs which are crucial for self-nonself recognition in the germline (Aravin et al., 2006; 
Batista et al., 2008; Brennecke et al., 2007; Brennecke et al., 2008; Mochizuki et al., 
2002; Shirayama et al., 2012; Vagin et al., 2006). In addition, a number of less-studied 
small RNA species have been described, including small RNAs derived from various 
longer noncoding RNAs including tRNAs – these latter RNAs are most commonly 
referred to as tRNA fragments, or “tRFs” (Anderson and Ivanov, 2014; Sobala and 
Hutvagner, 2011). While tRFs have been found in numerous small RNA sequencing 
datasets, they appear to be particularly abundant in contexts related to reproduction, as 
for example 3’ tRFs are the primary cargo of the Tetrahymena Piwi-related argonaute 
Tiwi12 (Couvillion et al., 2010), while 5’ tRFs comprise the vast majority (~80%) of small 
RNAs in mature mammalian sperm (Chen et al., 2016; Garcia-Lopez et al., 2014; Peng 
et al., 2012; Sharma et al., 2016). 
The mechanisms responsible for the biogenesis of the small RNA payload of 
mammalian sperm are not completely understood. Small RNA dynamics have been 
extensively studied during the process of testicular spermatogenesis, where three piwi-
clade argonaute proteins (MIWI, MILI, and MIWI2) orchestrate two major waves of 
piRNA biosynthesis (Aravin et al., 2006; Aravin et al., 2007; Kuramochi-Miyagawa et al.,

 2004; Li et al., 2013). Initially, “pre-pachytene” piRNAs – comprised primarily of piRNAs 
derived from repeat elements – are expressed beginning in spermatogonia (Aravin et 
al., 2007), followed by a wave of unique pachytene piRNAs which are processed from 
214 long noncoding precursor transcripts (Li et al., 2013). Given that small RNAs found 
in testes are almost entirely comprised of piRNAs, it is curious that the vast majority of 
small RNAs present in mature sperm are 5’ tRNA fragments, as noted above. Indeed, 5’ 
tRFs are vanishingly scarce (~2% of all small RNAs) in intact testes despite the fact that 
testes are primarily comprised of gametes at varying stages of development, raising the 
broader question of how and when small RNAs are gained or lost during post-testicular 
maturation. 
We recently discovered a potential role for the epididymis – a long convoluted 
tubular structure where mammalian sperm undergo post-testicular maturation – in 
modulating the small RNA repertoire of maturing sperm (Sharma et al., 2016). We found 
that tRNA cleavage occurs robustly in the epididymis, and that small vesicles secreted 
by the epididymal epithelium, known as epididymosomes (Belleannee et al., 2013; Krapf 
et al., 2012; Sullivan et al., 2007; Sullivan and Saez, 2013), carry a very similar 
population of small RNAs to that gained by sperm during epididymal transit (Sharma et 
al., 2016). Moreover, as sperm successively pass from caput (proximal) to cauda 
(distal) epididymis, sperm gain those specific small RNAs that are locally enriched in the 
underlying epithelium. Finally, we and others (Reilly et al., 2016) have shown that 
epididymosomes can deliver small RNAs to relatively immature caput epididymal sperm 
in vitro, suggesting that the sperm small RNA repertoire is shaped by soma-to-germline 
trafficking of small RNAs. 
Here, we rigorously test this hypothesis, characterizing developmental dynamics 
of small RNAs across multiple purified sperm populations spanning testicular and post-
testicular development. We detected very low levels of tRFs in all testicular germ cell 
populations, including mature testicular spermatozoa, confirming that tRFs are only 
gained upon entry into the epididymis. This maturation step could be partially 
recapitulated in vitro, as we show that epididymosomes from the proximal epididymis 
can deliver a wide variety of small RNAs, including both microRNAs and tRFs, to 
testicular spermatozoa. Finally, we use a chemogenetic approach to definitively identify 
the tissue of origin for small RNAs present in mature cauda epididymal sperm. Using 
epididymis-specific expression of UPRT to enable 4-thiouracil labeling of small RNAs 
synthesized in the caput epididymis, we show that mature cauda sperm carry small 
RNAs first synthesized in the epididymis epithelium. Taken together, these data 
conclusively demonstrate that small RNAs are trafficked from soma to germline in 
mammals, and provide further evidence that the small RNA payload of mature sperm is 
shaped by successive waves of epididymosomal delivery during epididymal maturation.

 Small RNA dynamics during sperm development and maturation 
We and others have previously reported that sperm isolated from either the cauda 
(distal) or caput (proximal) epididymis carry a small RNA payload comprised primarily of 
5’ tRNA fragments (tRFs). In contrast, tRNA cleavage as assayed both by small RNA 
sequencing and by Northern blot is nearly undetectable in intact testes, where the vast 
majority of small RNAs are piRNAs (Peng et al., 2012; Sharma et al., 2016). Although 
these data suggest that tRFs are gained upon entry into epididymis, it remains formally 
possible that tRFs are gained during the last stages of testicular spermiogenesis as 
round spermatids mature into testicular spermatozoa. 
To better characterize small RNA dynamics throughout the processes of 
testicular spermatogenesis/spermiogenesis and post-testicular maturation, we purified 
six germ cell populations from the reproductive tracts of sexually mature (8-12 weeks) 
male mice. We purified four testicular populations, including primary spermatocytes and 
two fractions of round spermatids as in (Sharma et al., 2016), as well as testicular 
spermatozoa which were purified using percoll gradients (Materials and Methods, 
Supplemental Figure S1). In addition, mature sperm were obtained from caput and 
cauda epididymis as previously described. Total RNAs were extracted and small RNAs 
(18-40 nucleotides) were purified and subject to deep sequencing. Our data recapitulate 
prior findings, with piRNAs dominating the small RNA repertoire of spermatocytes and 
round spermatids, and tRFs being the primary small RNA population in both caput and 
cauda epididymal sperm (Figure 1, Table S1). Turning to the previously-unexamined 
testicular spermatozoa, we find that even at this late stage of maturation sperm 
resemble other testicular populations rather than epididymal sperm – they continue to 
carry high levels of piRNAs (~70% of small RNA reads), having yet to gain abundant 
tRFs (~7% of reads). These data provide further insight into a major transition in sperm 
small RNAs, demonstrating that the RNA payload of mammalian sperm shifts from 
piRNAs to tRFs at some point after exiting the testis for the epididymis.  
In addition to the bulk differences in abundance of broad classes of small RNAs, 
we also find marked differences in specific individual RNA species present in each germ 
cell population, confirming for example the previously-described gain in tRF-Val-CAC 
that occurs as sperm transit from caput to cauda epididymis (Sharma et al., 2016). In 
order to broadly illuminate the major dynamic behaviors observed during sperm 
maturation, we grouped small RNAs across the six stages studied here using K-means 
clustering (Figure 2A, K=6). This visualization highlights the major transitions in small 
RNA populations described above, as Clusters 1 and 2 show the global loss of piRNAs 
that occurs after sperm exit the testis, and Cluster 6 illustrates the gain of tRFs that 
occurs in the epididymis. Interestingly, a handful of other small RNAs exhibit similar 
behaviors to piRNAs and tRFs, as for example miR-34c is highly expressed in testis but 
is largely jettisoned upon entry into the epididymis. Other clusters reveal unanticipated

 behaviors, as for example Cluster 3 – characterized by maximal expression in testicular 
sperm – includes a relatively large number of piRNAs (all of which represent the unique 
“pachytene” piRNA class, rather than deriving from repeat elements), thus identifying a 
wave of piRNA biogenesis that occurs during the very last stages of testicular sperm 
development. Cluster 5 is also notable, as it is primarily comprised of fragments of 
mRNAs that are highly-expressed in the caput epididymis (Johnston et al., 2005). 
In contrast to the relatively tissue-specific expression of piRNAs and tRNA 
fragments, microRNAs exhibit a more diverse range of behaviors during 
spermatogenesis and sperm maturation. However, the visualization in Figure 2A is 
dominated by the bulk changes in piRNAs and tRFs, complicating the interpretation of 
microRNA dynamics – for example, the apparent restriction of Cluster 3 microRNA 
expression to testicular sperm might simply reflect diminished small RNA complexity in 
this sperm population, which has started to lose piRNAs but has yet to substantially gain 
tRFs (Figure 1). 
To investigate microRNA dynamics in more detail, we renormalized miR 
abundances according to total miR levels for each sperm population, rather than to all 
small RNAs, to avoid the confounding normalization effects of bulk piRNA/tRF loss and 
gain. This analysis revealed a range of dynamic behaviors of individual microRNAs 
(Figure 2B). The majority of microRNAs are either expressed during testicular 
spermatogenesis and then lost/diluted at later developmental stages, or conversely are 
expressed/gained primarily in later stages of sperm maturation. As example of the 
former behavior, microRNAs such as miR-30a and miR-34c are lost during epididymal 
maturation, presumably due to degradation or elimination in the residual body shed by 
sperm in the epididymis (Sprando and Russell, 1987). A subset of microRNAs such as 
miR-144 and miR-142 are highly abundant only in testicular spermatozoa, and are 
presumably only expressed during late stages of spermatogenesis and then lost by a 
similar mechanism. The converse behavior, in which miRNAs such as miR-125b, miR-
199a, miR-200b/c, miR-10a/b and let-7 family members increase in relative abundance 
during epididymal maturation, is consistent with these RNAs potentially being trafficked 
to epididymal sperm alongside the bulk delivery of tRFs (Reilly et al., 2016; Sharma et 
al., 2016). 
More surprising are cases of microRNAs that are abundant in testicular sperm as 
well as cauda sperm, but which appear to be scarce specifically in caput sperm. 
Interestingly, the majority of such microRNAs originate from genomic microRNA clusters 
of various sizes, ranging from small clusters (miR-15/16, the “oncomiR”17-92 cluster, 
etc.) up to the megabase-scale imprinted X-linked miR-880 cluster. This behavior is 
most consistent with these microRNAs initially being lost (by degradation or elimination) 
upon epididymal entry, followed by a second load of these miRNAs either being 
generated in situ in cauda sperm from their precursor molecules, or shipped from 
epididymis epithelium to the mature sperm by epididymosomes. Consistent with the

 latter hypothesis, many of the microRNAs that are specifically scarce in caput sperm are 
highly abundant in cauda epididymosomes (Table S1). These data thus uncover 
surprisingly complex small RNA dynamics during sperm development, and further 
underscore the major role of epididymal transit in modulation of the sperm epigenome. 
 
Caput epididymosomes deliver small RNAs to testicular spermatozoa 
Our data confirm and extend prior reports showing major differences between the small 
RNAs generated during testicular spermatogenesis and those gained during epididymal 
transit. What is the mechanism by which tRFs and other small RNAs are gained as 
sperm enter the epididymis? We previously showed that epididymosomes secreted by 
the epithelium of cauda epididymis have a similar RNA payload to that of mature sperm, 
and we and others showed that epididymosomes can deliver small RNAs to relatively 
“immature” caput sperm (Reilly et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2016). However, as the RNA 
repertoire of caput sperm is not particularly distinct from that of cauda sperm – caput 
sperm already carry high levels of most tRNA fragments, for example – these 
reconstitution studies could only focus on a small handful of fairly cauda-specific 
species such as tRF-Val-CAC. In contrast, the RNA payload of testicular spermatozoa, 
which is dominated by piRNAs, is highly distinct from that of either epididymal sperm 
population, providing us with a “blank slate” to more broadly explore the ability of 
epididymosomes to deliver RNAs to immature sperm. 
Testicular sperm were isolated, then were either mock treated or were incubated 
for two hours with caput epididymosomes, and resulting sperm were extensively 
washed to remove any contaminating vesicles (Figure 3A). We first used TaqMan qRT-
PCR assays to ask whether two prominent tRFs present in epididymosomes but scarce 
in testicular sperm could be delivered by this reconstitution, finding that epididymosomal 
delivery results in a ~4-10-fold increase in abundance for these two tRFs (Figure 3B). 
To more broadly interrogate epididymosomal RNA delivery to sperm, we next carried 
our deep sequencing of small RNAs from mock and “reconstituted” sperm. Globally, we 
observed significantly higher levels of tRFs and microRNAs in reconstituted 
spermatozoa, relative to mock-treated sperm (Figures 3C, Table S2). Although two 
hours incubation is clearly insufficient to fully establish the caput small RNA payload, 
this is perhaps unsurprising given that purified caput sperm from intact animals have 
spent several days undergoing this delivery process. 
More granular analysis of specific small RNA species revealed that the vast 
majority of piRNAs were unaffected by epididymosomal fusion (Figures 3D-E), 
consistent with the fact that piRNAs are expressed during testicular spermatogenesis 
and are largely absent from epididymosomes (and indicating that epididymosomal

 fusion does not induce piRNA degradation). This is clearly visualized in the scatterplot 
in Figure 3E, where piRNA abundance is strongly correlated between mock-treated and 
reconstituted sperm samples. Globally, nearly all small RNAs either fall on the same 
diagonal as the piRNAs – meaning that they are unaffected by epididymosomal fusion – 
or above this diagonal, consistent with delivery by epididymosomes. Individual tRFs and 
microRNAs exhibited a range of behaviors (Figures 3D-E), ranging from those 
unaffected by epididymosomal incubation and which are generally already abundant in 
testicular sperm and/or absent from caput epididymosomes, to efficiently-delivered 
small RNAs that are highly abundant in caput epididymosomes (such as miR-10a/b, 
miR-148, miR-143, tRF-Glu-CTC, tRF-Gly-GCC, and tRF-His-GTG – Table S2). 
Overall, these data show that caput epididymosomes are capable of fusing with 
mature testicular spermatozoa to deliver their small RNA cargo in vitro, and together 
with the in vivo small RNA dynamics detailed above are most consistent with a 
mechanism of RNA biogenesis in mammalian sperm in which small RNAs generated in 
the epididymis are trafficked to sperm in epididymosomes. 
 
Chemogenetic tracking of small RNAs from epididymis to sperm 
Although multiple observations here and elsewhere are most readily explained by the 
hypothesis that small RNAs in mature sperm are first generated in the epididymal 
epithelium, we have not formally ruled out the possibility that the small RNAs gained by 
sperm during epididymal maturation in intact animals are instead processed in situ from 
precursor molecules first synthesized during testicular spermatogenesis. In order to 
distinguish between these possibilities, we developed a strategy to label and track small 
RNAs synthesized in specific cell types. We made use of the “TU tracer” mouse (Gay et 
al., 2013), in which tissue-specific expression of the Cre recombinase is used to drive 
expression of the gene encoding uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) (Figure 4A). 
Expression of UPRT allows cells to incorporate 4-thiouracil (4-TU) into newly-
synthesized RNAs, thereby enabling tissue-specific metabolic labelling of RNA (Figure 
4B). 
 
To assess the efficiency and specificity of this system, we first generated mice 
expressing UPRT specifically in liver by mating Albumin-Cre (Alb-Cre) mice with TU-
tracer mice. Cre-mediated recombination was extremely efficient, with nearly 
quantitative deletion of the GFP insert and concomitant expression of UPRT 
(Supplemental Figure S2A) – remaining GFP likely reflects non-hepatocyte cell 
populations, such as blood cells, present in the liver. The resultant mice expressed 
UPRT specifically in liver (Supplemental Figure S2A), and injection of 4-TU in these 
mice resulted in liver-specific labeling of RNAs, with undetectable background

 incorporation in other tissues (Supplemental Figures S2B-C). Northern blot of labeled 
RNAs revealed 4-TU labeling of a wide range of RNA species including microRNAs 
(see below), but tRNAs and rRNAs were not efficiently labeled (not shown), either due 
to poor use of 4-TU by PolI and PolIII, or due to checkpointing of these typically highly-
modified RNAs. This protocol therefore enables us to characterize microRNA trafficking 
in vivo, but unfortunately cannot be used to track tRFs. 
Although tracking TU-labeled RNAs in vivo could in principle be accomplished by 
biotinylation of 4-TU (Supplemental Figures S2B-C) and deep sequencing of avidin-
purified RNAs, we note that even in an abundant tissue such as the liver a very small 
fraction of RNA was 4-TU-labeled, and the abundance of any RNAs trafficked between 
cells would of course be far lower. Along with the fact that sperm overall have very low 
levels of total RNA, we anticipated extreme difficulty in purification of 4-TU-labeled 
RNAs. We therefore turned instead to thiol(S)-linked alkylation for the metabolic 
sequencing of RNA (SLAM-Seq, Herzog et al., submitted – see accompanying 
manuscript) for characterization of 4-TU-labeled small RNAs. This method is based on 
chemically modifying the 4-thiouracil in RNA with iodoacetamide to generate a covalent 
adduct that causes nucleotide misincorporation during reverse transcription, with G 
misincorporation opposite the modified U (seen as a U->C mutation in downstream 
deep sequencing) occurring most frequently. This method enables quantitative analysis 
of 4-TU incorporation in any clonable population of small RNAs, avoiding potentially 
lossy purification. To quantitate the signal-to-noise for this method, we first applied 
SLAM-Seq to small RNAs purified from the liver of Alb:Cre-expressing mice 
(Supplemental Figure S3). Background mutation rates in the cloning process were 
characterized using Alb:Cre mice that had not been injected with 4-TU, while analysis of 
cauda epididymis in these animals controlled for both cloning errors and for 4-TU 
incorporation into non-UPRT-expressing cells. As expected, we find that 4-TU 
incorporation caused a significant increase in misincorporation events specifically 
opposite U, with the strongest effect on U->C transitions (Supplemental Figure S3). 
This required 4-TU injection, was dose-dependent, and required tissue-specific 
expression of UPRT. Variation in the extent of U->C misincorporation for individual 
microRNAs reflects in vivo RNA synthesis and decay rates, as well as any effects of 
local sequence context on RT misincorporation. Together, these results demonstrate 
our ability to identify RNAs first synthesized in a given genetically-defined cell type. 
We therefore applied this system to track microRNAs synthesized in the caput 
epididymis, using the Defb41 promoter (Bjorkgren et al., 2012) to drive Cre specifically 
in the most proximal “initial segment” of the caput epididymis (Figure 4A-B). Mice 
carrying both the TU tracer cassette and Defb41:Cre exhibited the expected caput-
specific expression of UPRT (Figure 4C). Injection of 4-TU into these animals resulted 
in caput-specific incorporation of 4-TU as assessed by biotinylation of total RNA

 (Supplemental Figure S4A) and by SLAM-Seq analysis of purified small RNAs (Figure 
4D). Confident that we could reliably detect small RNAs synthesized in the caput 
epididymis, we therefore carried out SLAM-Seq for small RNAs isolated from the testis, 
caput epididymis, and cauda epididymal sperm in 4-TU-injected and control animals. 
Globally, we found no increase in U->C mutation in microRNAs purified from the testis, 
and a significant 2-fold increase in U->C in caput epididymis RNAs as expected (Figure 
4E, Table S3). 
Consistent with the hypothesis that cauda sperm carry microRNAs originally 
synthesized in the caput epididymis, SLAM-Seq of cauda sperm microRNAs revealed 
significantly greater 4-TU labelling than testes (Figure 4E-F, Supplemental Figure 
S4B). Although this effect is quantitatively modest, it is significant – Figure 4F shows 
the cumulative distribution plots for U->C mutations across all microRNAs for these 
samples (KS p value = 0.0003). Taken together, these data conclusively demonstrate 
that at least a subset of small RNAs in mature sperm are originally synthesized in the 
caput epididymis, and further support our hypothesis that small RNAs are trafficked 
from epididymis to sperm via epididymosomes.  
 
DISCUSSION  
Our data provide a detailed view of the biogenesis of the small RNA repertoire of 
mature mammalian sperm. We characterized dynamics of small RNAs across sperm 
development, finding that multiple waves of small RNAs are synthesized/loaded into 
sperm over the course of testicular spermatogenesis and post-testicular maturation in 
the epididymis. Moreover, we show that caput epididymosomes can deliver small RNAs 
to testicular spermatozoa in vitro, and use chemogenetic tracking to definitively identify 
epididymis-derived RNAs in mature sperm in intact animals. Together, our data reveal a 
surprising role for soma-to-germline trafficking in sculpting the sperm RNA payload. 
 
 
 
Small RNA dynamics throughout sperm maturation 
Analysis of small RNA repertoires of various purified sperm populations confirmed prior 
reports of a global loss of piRNAs and gain of tRFs that occurs over the course of post-
testicular maturation, and further identified a narrow anatomical window during which 
this transition occurs. In addition to this large-scale remodeling of the sperm small RNA 
payload, we also identified more subtle dynamic behaviors for smaller subsets of RNAs. 
Most interestingly, a large group of microRNAs were abundant in testicular sperm 
populations and are known to be expressed during spermatogenesis, but were then lost 
in caput epididymal sperm before increasing in abundance again in cauda sperm.

 These RNAs included a large number of microRNAs encoded in genomic clusters, 
including the imprinted X-linked miR-880 cluster, the miR-17-92 “oncomiR” cluster, and 
many smaller clusters. Importantly, it is highly unlikely that isolation of caput sperm 
somehow enriches for defective sperm undergoing a checkpointing or resorption 
process, as we have found in separate studies that ICSI using caput sperm and cauda 
sperm results in identical fertilization and blastocyst progression rates (Colin Conine 
and OJR, manuscript in preparation). 
Understanding the basis for this unusual behavior will be of great interest. The 
likeliest scenario is that these microRNAs are degraded, or ejected in the residual body, 
along with the bulk of piRNAs upon epididymal entry. They would then either be 
trafficked from the epididymis to caput sperm in epididymosomes, or, less likely, 
generated in situ via processing of precursor transcripts. One possibility is that entry into 
the epididymis is accompanied by a nearly global purge of small RNAs including 
microRNAs, with those microRNAs that appear to maintain abundance in caput 
epididymis (such as various let-7 family members) simply being those that are 
replenished earlier than those that are gained more distally. Whatever the mechanism 
for this process, the reason for the strong caput/cauda gradients in expression and 
trafficking of various small RNAs remains unclear, and will be the subject of future 
studies. 
 
 
Soma-to-germline RNA trafficking in the epididymis 
We also sought to characterize the mechanism responsible for the massive remodeling 
of the sperm RNA payload that occurs in the epididymis. Multiple lines of evidence 
support the hypothesis that a wide variety of small RNAs are synthesized in the 
epididymis epithelium and subsequently trafficked to maturing sperm in small 
extracellular vesicles, collectively known as epididymosomes: 1) Small RNAs that are 
gained as sperm enter the epididymis, such as tRFs, are highly abundant in the 
epididymis epithelium. 2) More locally, gradients in small RNA expression between the 
proximal and distal epididymis are manifest in sperm transiting the relevant region (as 
in, eg, the ~10-fold difference in tRF-Val-CAC between caput and cauda epididymis, 
sperm, and epididymosomes). 3) Using the TU tracer system, we definitively show here 
that microRNAs first synthesized in the caput epididymis make their way to maturing 
sperm, thus demonstrating that soma-to-germline transfer of small RNAs occurs in 
intact animals. 4) The likely mechanism for this transfer is RNA trafficking in 
epididymosomes, as purified epididymosomes carry a very similar RNA payload to that 
gained by sperm during epididymal transit. 5) Epididymosomes can deliver small RNAs 
to sperm in vitro.  
Our data thus identify a role for soma-to-germline trafficking in shaping the sperm 
RNA repertoire in mammalian sperm. This unites mammalian spermatogenesis with

 gametogenesis in a number of other species where RNAs produced in somatic support 
cells have been suggested or shown to be subsequently transferred into developing 
germ cells (Bourc'his and Voinnet, 2010; Slotkin et al., 2009). Previously-described 
examples of such soma-to-germline communication include: 1) communication between 
the somatic macronucleus and the germline micronucleus in ciliates such as 
Tetrahymena and Oxytricha , 2) piRNA communication from somatic follicle cells to the 
germline during Drosophila oogenesis, and 3) release of transposon repression in 
vegetative nuclei in Arabidopsis pollen, with resulting expression of transposons leading 
to generation of antitransposon RNAs which are transported into the sperm nuclei. 
Intriguingly, the process detailed here is quite distinct from most prior examples of 
soma-to-germline communication, as the trafficking process involves a vesicle 
intermediate rather than direct cytoplasmic connections (Mahajan-Miklos and Cooley, 
1994; McCue et al., 2011), and the RNAs being shipped are primarily microRNAs and 
tRNA fragments as opposed to repeat element-derived piRNAs/24 nt RNAs. 
Importantly, although a multitude of cell types secrete RNAs into extracellular vesicles in 
mammals (Tkach and Thery, 2016), there is as yet no evidence that circulating vesicles 
have access to the germline, which is protected by the blood-testis barrier – for 
example, we find no evidence in the Alb:Cre X TU-tracer experiments for liver to 
germline communication. Thus the epididymis, along with somatic cells of the testis 
such as Sertoli cells, may occupy a privileged position in this regard.  
 
Epigenetic remodeling during gametogenesis 
Many potentially heritable “epigenetic marks” in the germline are known to be erased 
during key stages of development, as for example cytosine methylation patterns 
undergo two major waves of erasure and re-establishment during the mammalian life 
cycle (Feng et al., 2010) – once in primordial germ cells, and again shortly after 
fertilization. Our findings reveal novel epigenetic reprogramming events that occur 
during mammalian spermatogenesis, as we document a major transition from a piRNA-
dominated stage of testicular spermatogenesis to the ultimate tRF-dominated payload 
of epididymal sperm, as well as a transient loss of clustered microRNAs that occurs in 
the caput epididymis.  
 
The mechanism by which this epigenetic remodelling occurs is of great interest 
given the mounting evidence that environmental signaling may be able to modulate 
specific epigenetic marks in germ cells and thereby potentially affect the phenotype in 
future generations (Lane et al., 2014; Rando, 2012). While it is well appreciated that our 
dietary conditions can influence the epigenome in somatic cells (Sharma and Rando, 
2017), it has not been clear how this information is communicated to the developing 
gametes and thus to offspring. The origin of sperm small RNAs in the epididymis 
provides a focus for future studies on the mechanism by which environmental conditions

 might influence the sperm epigenome. Understanding the molecular basis underlying 
sorting and packaging of small RNAs into epididymosomes will be of great interest 
(Gutierrez-Vazquez et al., 2013; Koppers-Lalic et al., 2014) as it will not only uncover 
basic mechanism of communication between the somatic cells of epididymis and the 
maturing gametes, but will also shed light on how environmental information is signaled 
to sperm.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Mouse strains and husbandry: Wild type FVB/NJ mice obtained from Jackson 
Laboratory were used for all experiments other than TU-tracer experiments. For TU-
tracer experiments, B6(D2)-Tg(CAG-GFP,-Uprt)985Cdoe (CAGFPstopUPRT mice) and 
Albumin-cre mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Defb41 iCre KI (TUKO 10) 
mouse embryos were a gift from Dr. Petra Sipilä, Univeristy of Turku Finland. Defb41 
iCre KI (TUKO 10) mouse line was regenerated at the Mouse Facility of UMass Medical 
School. All animal care and use procedures were in accordance with guidelines of the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 
 
Tissues and sperm cells isolation: Testes, epididymis, caput sperm, cauda sperm, 
spermatocytes and round spermatids were isolated as described previously (Sharma et 
al., 2016). For mature testicular spermatozoa isolation, testes from one mouse (8-12 
weeks old) were minced in a 35-mm Petri dish containing 1ml 0.9% NaCl. Finely minced 
tissue slurry was then transferred to a 15ml conical tube and set aside for 3-5 minutes 
to allow tissue pieces to settle down. Next, the cell suspension was loaded onto 10.5 ml 
of 52% isotonic percoll (Sigma). The tubes were then centrifuged at 12000X g for 10 
minutes at 10oC. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 0.9% NaCl and spun at 600X 
g at 4oC for 10 minutes. The pellet was next washed with 0.45% NaCl solution 3 times,

 followed by one wash with 1X PBS to retrieve purified mature testicular spermatozoa. 
Spermatozoa pellets were then either flash frozen or used for fusion with 
epididymosomes. 
 
Epididymosome isolation: Epididymosomes were isolated as previously described 
(Sharma et al., 2016). Briefly, caput epididymides were dissected from 8-12 weeks old 
male mice and placed in dishes containing 1 ml Whitten’s media (100 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM 
KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 5.5 mM Glucose, 1 mM Pyruvic acid, 4.8 mM 
Lactic acid (hemicalcium), and HEPES 20 mM) pre-warmed at 37oC. The epididymides 
were then gently squeezed using forceps to isolate epididymal luminal content. The 
dishes containing epididymal luminal contents were then placed in an incubator set at 
37oC with 5% CO2 for 15 minutes, to allow any remaining epididymal contents to 
release from the tissue. Next, the media containing epididymal luminal contents was 
transferred to a 1.5 ml tube and allowed to incubate for an additional 15 minutes. At the 
end of the 15 minutes, any tissue pieces or non-motile sperm settled down at the 
bottom of the tube and all the contents of the tube except for the bottom ~50 l were 
transferred to a fresh tube. Next, the tube was spun in a tabletop centrifuge at 2000X g 
for 2 minutes to pellet down sperm. Supernatant, which contains epididymosomes, was 
then transferred to a fresh tube and centrifuged at 10000X g for 30 minutes at 4oC to 
get rid of any non-sperm cells and cellular debris. Supernatant from this spin was then 
transferred to a polycarbonate thick wall tube (13 X 56 mm, Beckman Coulter, Catalog 
number 362305) and centrifuged at 100000X g for 2 hours at 4oC in a tabletop 
ultracentrifuge (Beckman Optima TL) using TLA100.4 rotor. The pellet from this spin 
was then washed with 500 l 1X PBS and centrifuged for another 2 hours at 100000X g 
at 4oC.  Finally, the pellet containing epididymosomes was resuspended in 50 l ice-
cold 1X PBS, transferred to a 1.5 ml tube and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen or used for 
fusion with sperm.  
 
Testicular spermatozoa and caput epididymosomes fusion: After final wash with 
1XPBS, caput epididymosomes were resuspended in 62.5 l media out of which 12.5 l 
was flash frozen and 50 l was used for fusion with testicular spermatozoa. For fusion 
reaction, purified 100 l of testicular spermatozoa were mixed with 50 l of caput 
epididymosomes in presence of 1 mM ZnCl2 and incubated at 37oC for 2 hours. In 
parallel, a mock fusion reaction was also performed where no epididymosomes were 
added to the reaction. At the end of the incubation, additional 850 l of 1X PBS was 
added to the reaction and sperm were spun down at 4000X g for 5 minutes. Next, the 
pellet was washed with 1X PBS three times and processed further for RNA extraction.

The finding of epididymosomal RNAs in resulting “reconstituted sperm” (Figure 
3) show that caput epididymosomes are either capable of fusing with mature testicular 
spermatozoa to deliver their small RNA cargo, or, less likely, that a small subset of 
vesicles with a distinctive small RNA payload adhere to spermatozoa strongly enough to 
resist removal by several consecutive washing steps 
 
TaqMan assays: Taqman assays were performed as described previously (Sharma et 
al., 2016). Custom small RNA assays for tRF-Val-CAC, tRF-GluCTC, tRF-GlyGCC and 
pre-designed assay for miR34c were purchased from Life Technologies.  
 
Small RNA deep sequencing: Isolation of 18-40 nts small RNAs was carried out as 
previously described (Sharma et al., 2016) by purification from 15% polyacrylamide-7M 
urea denaturing gels. The resulting small RNA was used for preparing sequencing 
libraries using the Small RNA TrueSeq kit from Illumina (as per the manual). Small RNA 
sequencing data was analyzed as described previously (Sharma et al., 2016).  
 
Generation of mice expressing tissue-specific UPRT: To generate mice expressing 
tissue specific UPRT, we crossed homozygous CAGFPstopUPRT mice with either liver-
specific Albumin-cre mice or caput epididymis specific Defb41-cre mice, to generate 
heterozygous [Uprt-/+, Alb-Cre ]or [Uprt-/+, Defb41-Cre] mice, respectively. Since 4-
thiouracil incorporation is sensitive to the levels of UPRT, we then backcrossed these 
mice with homozygous CAGFPstopUPRT mice to produce mice homozygous for Uprt 
gene. Mouse genotyping was performed using quantitative PCR (qPCR) with DNA 
isolated from ear punches. For genotyping CAGFPstopUPRT mice, following primers 
and probes were used: 5’-ATT CCA AGA TCT GTG GCG TC-3’ and 5’-CTT CTC GTA 
GAT CAG CTT AGG C-3’ for mutant allele; 5’-CAC GTG GGC TCC AGC ATT-3’ and 5’-
TCA CCA GTC ATT TCT GCC TTT G-3’ for wildtype allele; probe 5’- /Cy5/CCA ATG 
GTC GGG CAC TGC TCA A/Black Hole Quencher 2/-3’ for wildtype allele and probe 5’-
/6-FAM/CCG CAT CGG GAA AAT CCT CAT CCA/Black Hole Quencher 2/-3’ for mutant 
allele. Albumin–cre mice were genotyped using: 5’-TTG GCC CCT TAC CAT AAC TG-
3’ for both wildtype and mutant allele, 5’-TGC AAA CAT CAC ATG CAC AC-3’ for 
wildtype allele, and 5’-GAA GCA GAA GCT TAG GAA GAT GG-3’ for mutant allele. 
Primers for Defb41-cre mice included: 5’-AGA TGC CAG GAC ATC AGG AAC CTG-3’ 
and 5’-ATC AGC CAC ACC AGA CAC AGA GAT C-3’ for transgene, 5’-CTA GGC CAC 
AGA ATT GAA AGA TCT-3’ and 5’-GTA GGT GGA AAT TCT AGC ATC ATC C-3’ for 
internal positive control. The qPCR conditions were as follows: 95°C for 3 min, followed 
by 10 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 65°C for15 sec, decrement of temperature by 0.5°C per

 cycle, 68°C for10 sec, and 28 cycles of 95°C for 20 sec, 60°C for 20 sec, and 72°C for 
15 sec, with a final extension at 72°C for 2 min. 
 
4-thiouracil (4-TU) treatment: 4-TU was dissolved in DMSO at 200 mg/ml and stored 
at -20°C. Prior to use, the stock solution was diluted at 1:4 with corn oil with rigorous 
shaking and working solution was then kept in dark. 8-12 weeks old adult mice were 
intraperitoneally injected with either 4-TU (400 mg/kg body weight) or solvent alone       
(control) every other day for 5 times, as sperm transits from caput to cauda epididymis 
in approximately 10 days. Tissue and sperm samples were collected (as described 
above) 5 hours after the last injection, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C 
until RNA extraction. 
 
Northern and Dot blot analysis: We followed published method for dot blot analysis 
with some modifications (Radle et al., 2013). In brief, equal amount of RNA (in binding 
buffer) from different experimental groups, was applied to Zeta membrane (Bio-Rad). A 
biotin-labeled DNA oligo was used as a positive control. The membrane was air-dried at 
room temperature for 5 minutes, followed by blocking at room temperature for 30 
minutes with 10% SDS in PBS and 1mM EDTA. Next, the membrane was incubated in 
a solution containing 10% SDS in PBS and Streptavidin-HRP (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
for 15 minutes at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBS containing SDS 
for 5 minutes each. After the final wash, biotinylated RNA were detected with 
Amersham ECL Western Blotting Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) using 
Amersham Imager 600 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). For Northern blot analysis, 30 μg 
of RNA was denatured and run on a 15% acrylamide 7M urea gel, followed by transfer 
to a positively charged nylon membrane and UV-crosslinking. The membrane was next 
incubated with Streptavidin-HRP, washed and detected using ECL reagent, as above. 
 
Western blot: Protein extracts were prepared from mouse tissues using RIPA lysis 
buffer (150 mM sodium chloride, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 
and 50mM Tris, pH 8.0). Protein extracts were denatured with 2X Laemmli buffer (4% 
SDS, 10% 2-mercaptothanol, 20% glycerol, 0.004% bromophenol blue, 0.125 M Tris-
HCl, pH 6.8) at 95°C for 5 min and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to 
PVDF membrane. The membrane was next probed with anti-GFP (Invitrogen), anti-HA 
(Thermo Scientific) or anti-Actin (Thermo Scientific) antibodies at 1:1000 dilution 
followed by secondary antibody treatment at 1:2000 dilution (anti-mouse HRP and anti-
rabbit HRP, Cell Signalling).

SLAM-seq: 4 µg of isolated total RNA was treated with 10 mM iodoacetamide under 
optimal reaction conditions (50 mM NaPi, pH8; 50% v/v DMSO; 15 min at 50˚C). The 
reaction was quenched by addition of 10 mM DTT, followed by ethanol precipitation and 
small RNA library preparation as described previously (Jayaprakash et al., 2011). 
Briefly, total RNA was size selected (18-30 nt) by 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis and subjected sequentially to 3´ and 5´ adapter ligation (employing 
linker oligonucleotides with four random nucleotides at the ligation interface to avoid 
ligation biases). Gel-purified ligation products were reverse transcribed using 
SuperScript III (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by 
PCR amplification and high-throughput sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 
instrument (SR100 mode). 
 
Data analysis: For the analysis of SLAM-seq datasets, small RNA reads were aligned 
using bowtie v.1.2 (Langmead et al., 2009), allowing for 3 mismatches, to all mouse pre-
miRNA hairpins described in mirbase v.21 (Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2014) and 
extended downstream by 20 basepairs. All reads mapping to 5p and 3p arms of a 
miRNA hairpin locus were filtered to only retain the most frequent 5´ isoform. Mutation 
rates were determined by investigating the occurrence of any given mutation within the 
miR body (nt 1-18) of the most abundant miRNA 5ʹ isoforms, normalized to the genome 
matching instances at this position and frequency of each nucleotide within the 
inspected region. Reads containing T>C conversions within the miR body were counted 
and normalized to U-content and total mapping reads to assess abundance in cpm.

A) Experimental schematic. Purified testicular sperm, which carry extremely low levels 
of tRFs, were incubated with caput epididymosomes for 2 hours, followed by extensive 
washing. Small RNAs were purified from either mock-treated testicular sperm, or 
reconstituted sperm, and deep sequenced.

~0.6). Values over -0.6 therefore indicate gain of RNA during the fusion protocol.  
E) Scatterplot of small RNA abundances from deep sequencing data. The strong 
diagonal for piRNAs again indicates RNAs present in testicular sperm that are not 
affected by the delivery process. Note that essentially all RNAs here either lie along this 
diagonal, indicating that they are either absent or nearly so in caput eididymosomes, or 
above the diagonal, indicating widespread delivery of many RNA species to testicular 
sperm during reconstitution. 
 
Figure 4: Chemogenetic tracking of RNAs from epididymis to sperm 
A) Schematic of the TU tracer locus. In the absence of Cre, GFP is expressed from a 
ubiquitous promoter, with no UPRT expression. Cre drives LoxP recombination, 
eliminating GFP and juxtaposing the promoter with HA-UPRT. 
B) Experimental design. UPRT is expressed specifically in the initial segment of the 
caput epididymis due to expression of Defb41:Cre. Upon injection of 4-thiouracil, RNAs 
synthesized in this tissue incorporate 4-TU. Animals are injected with 4-TU every 2 days 
for 9 days (5 injections), and 5 hours after injection on Day 9 sperm are isolated from 
the cauda epididymis and assayed for 4-TU labeling of small RNAs. 
C) Western blots showing HA-UPRT expression specifically in the caput epididymis of 
Defb41:Cre X TU-tracer animals. 
D) SLAM-Seq induces miscloning of uracil in a Cre and 4-TU-dependent manner. 
Defb41:Cre X TU-tracer animals were either injected with 4-TU (every other day for 9 
days) or sham-injected, and testis and caput epididymis were dissected. Small RNAs 
were purified and subject to SLAM-Seq. Reads were mapped to microRNAs using a 
mismatch-tolerant custom pipeline (Methods) and nucleotide misreads were compiled 
for all microRNAs with at least 1000 reads (boxes show median and 25th/75th 
percentiles, whiskers show 5th and 95th percentiles). 4-TU induces misreading of uracils 
specifically in Cre-expressing tissue, with U->C being the most common mutation 
observed (p = 1.2e-6, t test). 
E) Log2 ratio of U->C rates for 4-TU injected vs. uninjected animals, for all microRNAs 
with at least 1000 reads for the indicated tissues. Two bars show two biological replicate 
experiments. U->C mutation rate increases in caput epididymis, as expected (see panel 
D), and also in cauda sperm, indicating the presence of caput-derived microRNAs in 
cauda sperm. The modest increase in U->C mutation in mature sperm reflects multiple 
factors: 1) the signal to noise in caput epididymis is already modest (2-fold); 2) cauda

 sperm presumably carry a wide range of unlabelled RNAs originating in the testis or 
other parts of the epididymis; 3) sperm in the cauda epididymis can survive for longer 
than the time frame of this experiment and so will include a population of unlabelled 
sperm that passed through the caput epididymis prior to 4-TU injections.

control. See also Supplemental Figure S4B.

SUPPLEMENTAL FIGURE LEGENDS 
Supplemental Figure S1: Purification of testicular spermatozoa. DIC images of 
purified testicular germ cells: spermatocytes, early and late round spermatids (scale bar 
= 18 m), and mature testicular spermatozoa (scale bar = 6 m).  
 
Supplemental Figure S2: Validation of TU-tracer system  
A) Western blot showing GFP and HA-UPRT levels in livers and several reproductive 
tissues isolated from TU-tracer animals not expressing Cre (top) or expressing liver-
specific Albumin-Cre recombinase (bottom). In the absence of Cre, GFP is expressed 
from a ubiquitous promoter, with no UPRT expression. In mice expressing liver specific 
Cre recombinase, GFP is eliminated by LoxP recombination, leading to expression of 
HA-UPRT specifically in liver tissues. 
B) Dot blot for RNA isolated from TU-tracer animals not expressing Cre and injected 
with either 4-TU or vehicle alone. As shown, only positive control (Biotinylated DNA 
oligo) is detectable upon incubation with Streptavidin-HRP.  
C) Dot blot for RNA isolated from Albumin-Cre X TU tracer mice injected with two 
different doses of 4-TU. Upon 4-TU injection RNAs are specifically labeled, in a dose 
dependent manner, in liver tissue and not in control tissue (cauda epididymis). 
 
Supplemental Figure S3: SLAM-Seq mutation rates 
TU tracer X Alb:Cre animals were either injected with 4-TU (400 mg/kg body weight) or 
with vehicle (solvent only) and sacrificed 5-6 hours after the last injection for tissue 
harvest. Small RNAs were isolated from either cauda epididymis or from liver, and 
subject to SLAM-Seq, and sequencing reads were mapped to microRNAs using an 
error-tolerant pipeline. Mismatches were identified for all reads mapping to a given 
microRNA, and boxplots (box: 25th/50th/75th percentile; whiskers: 5th/95th percentile) 
show the frequency of various mismatches for mock-injected and 4-TU-injected 
animals, as indicated.

Supplemental Figure S4:  
A) Dot blots for RNA isolated from TU-tracer animals expressing Defb41-Cre mice, 
either injected with 4-TU or vehicle alone. Only upon 4-TU injection, RNAs are 
specifically labeled in caput epididymis and not in control tissues (testis and cauda 
epididymis)
