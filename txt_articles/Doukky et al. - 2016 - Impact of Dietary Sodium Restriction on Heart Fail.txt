Abstract
Background—Although sodium restriction is advised for patients with heart failure (HF), data 
on sodium restriction and HF outcomes are inconsistent.
Objective—We sought to evaluate the impact of sodium restriction on HF outcomes.
Methods—We analyzed data from the multi-hospital, Heart Failure Adherence and Retention 
Trial which enrolled 902 NYHA class II/III HF patients and followed them for a median of 36 
months. Sodium intake was serially assessed by a food frequency questionnaire. Based on the 
mean daily sodium intake prior to the first event of death or HF hospitalization, patients were 
classified into sodium restricted (<2,500 mg/day) and unrestricted (≥2,500 mg/day) groups. Study 
groups were propensity score-matched according to plausible baseline confounders. The primary 
outcome was a composite of death or HF hospitalization. The secondary outcomes were cardiac 
death and HF hospitalization.
Results—Sodium intake data were available for 833 subjects (145 sodium restricted, 688 sodium 
unrestricted), of whom 260 were propensity-matched into sodium restricted (n=130) and sodium 
unrestricted (n=130) groups. Sodium restriction was associated with significantly higher risk of 
death or HF hospitalization (42.3% vs. 26.2%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.83; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 1.21–2.84; P=0.004), derived from an increase in the rate of HF hospitalization (32.3% vs. 
20.0%; HR, 1.82; CI, 1.11–2.96; P=0.015) and a non-significant increase in the rate of cardiac 
death (HR, 1.62; CI, 0.70–3.73; P=0.257) and all-cause mortality (P=0.074). Exploratory subgroup

 analyses suggested that sodium restriction was associated with increased risk of death or HF 
hospitalization in patients not receiving angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin 
receptor blocker (HR, 5.78; CI, 1.93–17.27; P=0.002).

detrimental impact on outcome. A randomized clinical trial is needed to definitively address the 
role of sodium restriction in HF management.

INTRODUCTION
Heart failure (HF) continues to increase in prevalence with an enormous impact on 
morbidity and mortality.(1) The treatment of HF involves both pharmacologic and non-
pharmacologic approaches.(2) Traditionally, one of the cornerstones of non-
pharmacological management in HF has been restricting dietary sodium intake. Data 
supporting this approach are inconsistent, as some studies have shown benefit,(3,4) while 
others demonstrated better outcomes with sodium liberalization.(5–7) This controversy has 
manifested in the American College of Cardiology Foundation / American Heart 
Association (ACCF/AHA) guidelines for the management of HF. The 2009 guideline gave 
sodium restriction in patients with symptomatic HF a Class I recommendation 
(recommended) to reduce congestive symptoms with “Level of Evidence C” (expert 
consensus).(8) Other societal guidelines issued similar recommendations.(9) More recently, 
the 2013 ACCF/AHA guidelines downgraded the recommendation for sodium restriction to 
Class IIa (reasonable) with level of evidence C.(2)
In this study, we investigated the impact of sodium restriction on HF outcomes in patients 
enrolled in the Heart Failure Adherence and Retention Trial (HART), a behavioral 
intervention trial which assessed the efficacy of self-management counseling versus 
education alone in symptomatic HF patients.(10) We hypothesized that if sodium restriction 
was protective, there would be a difference in clinical outcomes and HF symptoms between 
patients with low versus high sodium intake.
METHODS
We analyzed data from HART,(10) which was a multi-hospital, partially blinded, behavioral 
randomized controlled trial, funded by the National Institutes of Health [HL065547]. HART 
assessed the impact of self-management counseling versus education alone on the primary 
outcome of death or HF hospitalization in patients with symptomatic HF. Details of the 
intervention, patient enrollment, eligibility, and results of the main trial were reported 
elsewhere.(10,11) The study enrolled from 10 centers in the Chicago metropolitan area and 
the behavioral intervention was conducted by Rush University Medical Center. The trial was 
approved by the institutional review board of each participating institution and was 
registered on clinicaltrials.gov [NCT00018005].

 Briefly, HART enrolled HF patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or 
III symptoms, having HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or preserved ejection 
fraction (HFpEF). Reduced systolic function was defined as left ventricular ejection fraction 
≤40%. Eligible patients had to have HF symptoms for no less than the prior 3 months and 
either (1) ejection fraction ≤40%; or (2) diuretic therapy for at least 3 months and one or 
more previous HF hospitalization. This was a null trial; it showed no significant impact of 
the self-management intervention on the composite of death or HF related hospitalization.
(10) For the purpose of the current study, we assessed the impact of sodium intake on HF 
outcomes in the HART population over a median follow-up of 36 months.
Sodium Intake Assessment
A standardized food frequency questionnaire was used to assess sodium intake at baseline 
and in annual follow-up visits at year 1, 2 and 3.(12) The questionnaire was developed and 
tested at Stanford University and had been used in multiple behavioral HF clinical trials, 
sponsored by the National Institutes of Health.(10–14) The questionnaire queries the intake 
of 57 commonly consumed food items in the American diet during the course of the 
preceding week, with particular emphasis on high sodium content meals. Each food item is 
weighted according to frequency of consumption and sodium content. Based on patients’ 
responses, estimates of daily sodium intake (milligrams) were calculated after adding an 
assumed baseline sodium consumption of 1,250 mg/day, derived from essential food items 
in the American diet (bread, meats, etc.), as detailed in Supplemental Table 1. Since sodium 
intake can vary, particularly during and after HF hospitalizations, we analyzed sodium 
intake as a time-dependent variable, averaging intake reported in all study visits preceding 
the first adverse event of death or HF hospitalization. We elected not to categorize the 
patients on the basis of a single sodium intake value since sodium consumption tends to vary 
over time.
Based on the reported average sodium consumption, we divided the cohort into two groups: 
1) lower sodium intake group (<2,500 mg/day), labeled “Restricted”; 2) higher sodium 
intake group (≥2,500 mg/day), labeled “Unrestricted”. Recommendations from various 
clinical societies and existing guidelines were considered in deciding this cut-off value.(9)
Clinical and Psychosocial Data
During baseline and yearly visits, data were gathered on demographics, psychosocial 
characteristics, medical comorbidities, medication usage and adherence, and NYHA class. 
Socioeconomic status was defined as low if the patient’s annual household income was <
$30,000 or if the highest attained education was high school or less. Medication adherence 
for key HF medications was assessed as the proportion of pills consumed relative to the 
prescribed amount using electronic pill bottle cap over the course of a month. In order to 
uniformly adjust for diuretic usage, the dosages of various loop diuretics were converted 
into furosemide dose equivalent (Supplemental Table 2). During each visit, the 6-minute 
walk distance was measured. Depression was defined by self-reported established diagnosis 
or scoring 10 or more on the Geriatric Depression Screening scale.(15) Chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) was defined as glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73m2 (Cockcroft-
Gault formula) or dialysis therapy. Coronary artery disease was defined as a prior history of

 coronary revascularization or confirmed myocardial infarction. Quality of life was assessed 
using health and functioning subscale of the Quality of Life Index, Cardiac Version - IV 
[modified](16) and two subscales from the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36).(17) 
We indexed the burden of 12 HF symptoms tallied using the cardiopulmonary subscale of 
the HF Symptom Checklist [modified] (Supplemental Table 3).(18)
Outcome Assessment
The primary outcome was a composite of death or HF hospitalizations, as in HART. 
Secondary outcomes were cardiac death and HF hospitalization. The median follow-up was 
36 months (interquartile range 27–36 months). The outcomes were determined by a blinded 
adjudication committee.(10) All patients or their family members (in the case of death) were 
contacted every 3 months by telephone to ascertain the occurrence of death or 
hospitalization. Reports of death were confirmed by medical records, death certificates, or 
queries from the Social Security Death Index. HF admissions were adjudicated by the 
presence of shortness of breath, peripheral edema, or chest radiographic evidence of 
pulmonary edema without an alternative diagnosis. HF admissions were confirmed if the 
patient responded to HF therapy or had a documented decrease in left ventricular function. 
Cardiac death was defined as death caused by myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or pump-
failure.
Statistical Analysis
Basic Statistical Methods—The chi-square test was used to compare dichotomous 
variables, which were expressed as numbers (percentages). The two-tailed Student’s t-test 
was used to compare normally-distributed continuous variables which were expressed as 
means ± standard deviations. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare skewed continuous 
data.
Propensity Score Matching—Since patients were not randomly assigned to sodium 
restriction, we matched patients according to their propensity to being sodium restricted. 
Multivariate logistic regression model (propensity model) was fit to calculate the probability 
of sodium restriction based on 32 baseline variables listed in Table 1 (identified with †). 
Additionally, two interaction terms, “CKD * angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor 
(ACEi) or angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) use” and “CKD * spironolactone use”, were 
included in the propensity model in order to balance the clinical implications of utilizing 
these agents. The resultant probabilities were then transformed into propensity score logits. 
Six-minute walk distance and quality of life were not included in the propensity model due 
to collinearity with NYHA class and SF-36 scores. Serum creatinine was not included in 
propensity model as it was accounted for in CKD status. Obesity was not included due to 
association with obstructive sleep apnea. Each patient in the sodium restricted group was 
then matched, in 1:1 ratio, to a patient in the unrestricted group with a propensity score 
within a caliper width of 0.2 * standard deviation of the propensity score logits, creating a 
propensity-matched cohort. Python software - version 2.6.7 (Python Software Foundation, 
Python.org) was used for propensity-matching. The absolute standardized differences in 
baseline covariates were calculated pre and post propensity-matching; covariates with >10% 
difference after matching were considered sub-optimally matched.

 Outcome Analyses—Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test were used to compare 
cumulative event rates in the entire cohort and in the propensity-matched cohort. Risk was 
expressed as hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), calculated using univariate 
and multivariate Cox regression models. To confirm the findings of the propensity-matched 
analyses in the entire cohort, we analyzed outcomes using multivariate Cox proportional-
hazards models, adjusting for the calculated propensity scores. The proportional hazards 
assumption with respect to Cox-regression modeling was confirmed using “log-minus-log” 
survival plots.
Subgroup Analyses—In exploratory, hypothesis-generating analyses, we studied the 
impact of sodium restriction on the primary outcome in predefined subgroups of gender, 
age, ethnicity (blacks vs. others), NYHA class (II vs. III), HFrEF vs. HFpEF, CKD, and the 
use of key HF medications (ACEi/ARB, spironolactone, β-blocker) prior to primary 
outcome events. Using multivariate Cox-regression models in the propensity-matched 
cohort, we tested the impact of an interaction between sodium restriction and each of the 
aforementioned subgroup strata on the primary outcome. To confirm the results in the entire 
cohort, subgroup analyses were also performed in the entire cohort using multivariate Cox 
regression models, adjusted for the propensity scores.
Longitudinal Analysis of Time-Varying Outcome Measures—Mixed-effects 
regression modeling in propensity-matched cohort was used to assess the influence of 
sodium restriction on the trajectory of the time-varying outcomes of 6-minute walk distance, 
cardiopulmonary HF symptoms, quality of life, SF-36 physical function score, SF-36 energy 
and vitality score, and daily loop diuretic dose. Due to its skewed distribution, the 6-minute 
walk distance was analyzed after a logarithmic transformation. The mixed-effects models 
employed the following structure: fixed effects included sodium intake group, time since 
baseline, sodium group by time interaction, and covariates with >10% absolute standardized 
difference between the propensity-matched groups (Figure 1); random-effects included 
intercept and time. Due to missing data, by design, from the third year visit, we analyzed 
continuous outcome data only over the first 2 years of the study.
Two-tailed P values <0.05 were considered significant. The PASW 18.0 software (SPSS, 
Inc. - Chicago, IL) and SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute - Cary, NC) were used for statistical 
analyses.
Power Analysis
Based on the observed rate of the primary outcome in HART (36.4%), we calculated, post-
hoc, that the available propensity-matched cohort provided the study 80% power to detect 
≥37% difference in the rate of the primary outcome based on the chi-square test (two-tailed 
α = 0.05).
RESULTS
Sodium intake data were available for 833 out of 902 (92%) subjects enrolled in HART. The 
median sodium intake was 3,336 mg/day (interquartile range 2,701–4,237 mg/day; range 
1,250–15,678 mg/day). Based on the mean sodium intake prior to primary outcome events

 (death or HF hospitalization), patients were classified into Restricted [n=145 (17.4%)] and 
Unrestricted [n=688 (82.6%)] sodium intake groups. The baseline characteristics of the 
study groups are summarized in Table 1. Notably, sodium restricted patients were more 
frequently women and were more likely to have CKD, prior stroke, to have been treated 
with a β-blocker, and to have received higher doses of loop diuretics.
During a median follow-up of 36 months, there were 163 (19.6%) deaths, 105 (12.6%) 
cardiac deaths, and 199 (23.9%) HF hospitalizations; 303 (36.4%) subjects had one or more 
events of death or HF hospitalization. As presented in Table 2, sodium restricted patients 
had a borderline increase in the rate of death or HF hospitalization (P=0.054) and 
statistically significant increase in HF hospitalizations (P=0.033). The rates of death and 
cardiac death were similar between the study groups (Table 2).
A total of 130 (90%) of the restricted sodium intake patients could be propensity-matched to 
unrestricted patients, resulting in a propensity-matched cohort of 260 patients (130 sodium 
restricted, 130 sodium unrestricted). After matching, there was no significant difference in 
the mean propensity score between the matched groups (P=0.956) and the balance between 
the study groups markedly improved, as none of the baseline characteristics were 
significantly different (Table 1). The propensity-matched groups were also well balanced in 
baseline characteristics not included in the propensity model, such as body mass index, 
systolic blood pressure, quality of life, 6-minute walk distance, and serum creatinine. The 
absolute standardized differences between the propensity-matched groups was <10% for the 
majority of baseline covariates (Figure 1).
In the propensity-matched cohort, there were 89 (34.2%) events of death or HF 
hospitalization during follow-up. As illustrated in Table 2 and Figure 2, sodium restriction 
was associated with a statistically significant increase in the rates of death or HF 
hospitalization (42.3% vs. 26.2%; HR, 1.85; CI, 1.21–2.84; P=0.004) and HF hospitalization 
(32.3% vs. 20.0%; HR, 1.82; CI, 1.11–2.96; P=0.015), a statistically non-significant increase 
in the rate of cardiac death (10.8% vs. 6.9%; HR, 1.62; CI, 0.70–3.73; P=0.257), and a trend 
towards increased risk of all-cause mortality (18.5% vs. 10.8%; HR, 1.62; CI, 0.94–3.53; 
P=0.074). To ensure that these findings were not confounded by sub-optimally matched 
baseline covariates, we analyzed the risk of adverse events after adjusting for covariates 
with post-matching absolute standardized difference >10% (stroke, β-blocker use, tobacco 
use, serum sodium, spironolactone use, lung disease, diabetes, NYHA class III, statin use, 
atrial fibrillation, ACEi/ARB use). After adjustment, sodium restriction continued to be 
associated with increased risk of death or HF hospitalization (adjusted HR, 1.72; CI, 1.12–
2.65; P=0.014) and HF hospitalization (adjusted HR, 1.68; CI, 1.02–2.75; P=0.040), and 
non-significant increase in the risk of cardiac death (P=0.319) and all-cause mortality 
(P=0.123), as shown in Table 2.
The findings of the propensity-matched analyses were confirmed in the entire cohort. As 
presented in Table 2, after adjusting for propensity scores, sodium restriction was associated 
with a significant increase in the rates of death or HF hospitalization (HR, 1.37; CI, 1.01–
1.86; P=0.042) and HF hospitalization (HR, 1.44; CI, 1.002–2.06; P=0.049), but there was

 no significant increase in the rate of cardiac death (P=0.928) or all-cause mortality 
(P=0.448).
Subgroup Analyses
Hazard ratios for sodium restriction were consistently greater than 1.0 in all subgroups, 
indicating increased risk (Figure 3). Notably, there was a significant interaction between 
sodium restriction and ACEi/ARB use (interaction P=0.021). This was confirmed when we 
tested for this interaction in the entire cohort adjusting for propensity scores (interaction 
P=0.009). This finding indicates a differential effect of sodium restriction, in that those who 
are not treated with an ACEi/ARB agent had a significantly increased risk of adverse 
outcome, whereas those treated with an ACEi/ARB had no significant increase in risk 
(Figure 3). Furthermore, there was a trend towards a significant interaction between sodium 
restriction and NYHA class (interaction P=0.138), in that sodium restriction was associated 
with a significantly greater hazard of adverse outcome in patients with NYHA class II 
symptoms, while the association was weaker in class III patients (Figure 3).
Time-Varying Heart Failure Outcome Measures
In the propensity-matched study groups, there were no significant baseline differences in the 
mean 6-minute walk distance, quality of life score, SF-36 physical function score, SF-36 
energy and vitality score, cardiopulmonary HF symptoms index, and loop diuretics daily 
dose (Table 1). As illustrated in Figure 4, during 2 years of follow-up, there was no 
significant difference between the study groups in the trajectory of change in 6-minute walk 
distance, quality of life, physical function, energy and vitality, HF cardiopulmonary 
symptoms, and loop diuretic dose (group*time interaction P values ≥ 0.242).
Sensitivity Analysis
Since sodium intake in the unrestricted group spanned over a wide range, we analyzed 
outcomes among patients who had moderate sodium intake (2,500–3,999 mg/day, n=440) 
vs. those with high sodium intake (≥4,000 mg/day, n=248), adjusting for propensity scores. 
There was a non-significant increase in the risk of death or HF hospitalization among the 
high vs. moderate sodium intake patients (HR, 1.07; CI, 0.80–1.42; P=0.642).
Patients with Missing Sodium Intake Data
Sixty-nine (7.6%) patients failed to complete the food frequency questionnaire; thus lacked 
sodium intake data. As compared to patients with available sodium intake data, they were 
more commonly African Americans (P=0.012), less likely to be married (P=0.047), and 
poorly adherent (mean, 15%) to key HF medical therapies (Supplemental Table 4). These 
subjects had higher rates of death or HF hospitalization, all-cause mortality, and cardiac and 
non-cardiac death (all P values ≤0.001), but had similar rates of HF hospitalization 
(P=0.903), (Supplemental Table 5).
DISCUSSION
In these analyses of data from Heart Failure Adherence and Retention Trial, there was no 
demonstrable evidence that dietary sodium restriction is associated with lower rate of death

 or HF hospitalization. In fact, dietary sodium restriction was associated with increased risk 
of adverse outcomes, particularly HF hospitalization. Although the increase in the rates of 
cardiac death and all-cause mortality among sodium-restricted patients were not statistically 
significant due limitation in statistical power, the hazard ratios of these events were 
commensurate with that of HF hospitalizations. Moreover, sodium restriction was not 
associated with a discernable impact on 6-minute walk distance, quality of life, physical 
function, energy and vitality, or cardio-pulmonary symptoms. These findings were not 
confounded by difference in diuretic utilization. Given the observational nature of this 
hypothesis generating study, a causal effect of sodium restriction cannot be established. 
Nonetheless, our findings challenge the present convention and press the need for multi-
center randomized trial to definitively address the role of sodium restriction in HF 
management.
For decades, dietary sodium restriction has been the cornerstone of HF management 
alongside medical therapy. The data supporting this recommendation are thin, leading to 
inconsistent guidelines from various professional societies.(9) A considerable body of 
literature indicates that sodium restriction is associated with detrimental hemodynamic and 
neurohormonal changes, such as decrease in cardiac index and renal perfusion and activation 
of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sympathetic activity.(9,19,20) Although 
Some studies have shown benefit with sodium restriction,(3,4) others have reported better 
outcomes with sodium liberalization.(5–7) Our study provides quality, multi-center 
observational evidence that low sodium intake may worsen HF outcomes, in agreement with 
single-center clinical trials.(5–7)
It is plausible that increased event rates observed in the sodium restricted group is due to 
reverse causality bias, such that sicker patients were more compliant with dietary restriction. 
The aforementioned explanation of our findings is unlikely given our systematic propensity-
matching according to wide range of plausible confounders, achieving well balanced groups 
in terms of key surrogate measures of HF severity and outcome, such as 6-minute walk, 
quality of life, physical functioning, medication adherence, and others. Moreover, patients 
were well matched in serum albumin, hemoglobin, body mass index, systolic blood 
pressure, kidney function, congestive HF symptoms and signs, and diuretics use; thus 
malnutrition, hypotension (end-stage HF), kidney disease, and fluid status were unlikely 
confounders to low sodium intake. For added rigor, we performed post-matching adjustment 
for any residual difference between the matched groups. Importantly, dietary sodium intake 
data in this cohort were not completely observational, since dietary sodium restriction was a 
major element of the intervention and control arms of HART.(10,11)
In exploratory subgroups analyses, sodium restriction appeared to be particularly detrimental 
in the small subgroup of patients not being treated with ACEi/ARB, suggesting that renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade may mitigate the neurohormonal effects of sodium 
restriction.(9) This is also consistent with the neurohormonal studies demonstrating 
activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in sodium restricted patients.(9,19,20) 
It is also notable that sodium restriction was detrimental among patients with NYHA class II 
symptoms, but had a minimal effect on those with class III symptoms. This observation is 
somewhat consistent with that of Lennie et al who reported in an observational cohort that

 sodium restriction (<3,000 mg/day) was associated with higher event rates of death or 
cardiac hospitalizations among patients with class I-II symptoms but lower event rates 
among class III-IV subjects.(5) It is plausible that excessive sodium restriction in euvolemic 
class II patients has led to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system causing 
deterioration of HF, while sodium restriction may have value in keeping hypervolemic class 
III patients from further fluid retention. The ACEi/ARB and NYHA class subgroup analyses 
suggest that the observed findings in the entire cohort were mediated through 
neurohormonal modulation rather than unrecognized confounders.
The study cohort is comprised of out-patients with chronic symptomatic HF. Therefore, the 
investigation provides no insight on the impact of sodium restriction in patients with acute 
decompensated HF, patients with severe class IV symptoms, or those with minimal class I 
symptoms. Additionally, the study provides no information on the effect of “sodium binges” 
on HF outcome. Furthermore, 7.6% of HART patients lacked sodium intake data; these 
patients were poorly compliant to key HF therapies and had poor cardiac and noncardiac 
outcomes. They seem to represent a challenging HF population with more fundamental 
compliance problems than sodium restriction, thus their outcomes were not solely dependent 
on their sodium intake.
Limitations
We lacked data on implantable devices and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide levels; these 
are potentially important covariates. We also lacked caloric intake data which may confound 
patients’ outcomes. However, we matched the patients based on surrogates for nutritional 
status, such as serum albumin and physical functioning, and ensured excellent match in body 
mass index. Determining sodium intake from food frequency questionnaire rather than “gold 
standard” 24-hour urinary sodium,(9,21) small sample size, and non-randomized design are 
notable limitation.
CONCLUSION
In patients with chronic HF, low dietary sodium intake (<2,500 mg/day) does not seem to 
reduce the risk of death or HF hospitalization compared to higher sodium intake (≥2,500 
mg/day). Low sodium intake seems to be associated with increased risk of HF 
hospitalization. Our findings support further downgrade of the ACCF/AHA sodium 
restriction recommendation in patients with chronic HF to Class IIb, and press the need for 
multi-center randomized trial to definitively address the role of sodium restriction in HF 
management.

 CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES
Competencies in Medical Knowledge
Despite limited and conflicting data, sodium restriction is generally recommended for 
patients with chronic heart failure (HF). In this observational study of patients enrolled in 
the HF Adherence and Retention Trial, we demonstrated that sodium restriction (<2,500 
mg/day) was associated with increased risk of the composite endpoint of death or HF 
hospitalizations and HF hospitalization. Sodium restriction was not associated with 
improved quality of life, physical functioning, 6-minute walk distance, or symptoms.
Translational Outlook
These findings further question the value of sodium restriction in the management of 
patients with chronic symptomatic HF, and pressing the need for multi-center 
randomized trials to definitively address this matter.
