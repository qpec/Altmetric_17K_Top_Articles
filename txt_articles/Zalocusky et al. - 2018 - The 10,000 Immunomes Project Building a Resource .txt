SUMMARY
There is increasing appreciation that the immune
system plays critical roles not only in the traditional
domains of infection and inflammation but also in
many areas of biology, including tumorigenesis,
metabolism, and even neurobiology. However, one
of the major barriers for understanding human immu-
nological mechanisms is that immune assays have
not been reproducibly characterized for a sufficiently
large and diverse healthy human cohort. Here, we
present the 10,000 Immunomes Project (10KIP),
a framework for growing a diverse human immu-
nology reference, from ImmPort, a publicly available
resource of subject-level immunology data. Although
some measurement types are sparse in the presently
deposited ImmPort database, the extant data allow
for a diversity of robust comparisons. Using 10KIP,
we describe variations in serum cytokines and
leukocytes by age, race, and sex; define a baseline
cell-cytokine network; and describe immunologic
changes in pregnancy. All data in the resource are
available for visualization and download at http://
10kimmunomes.org/.
INTRODUCTION
The advancement of technologies in preclinical immunology (El-
shal and McCoy, 2006; Leng et al., 2008; Maecker et al., 2010;
Saeys et al., 2016; Spitzer and Nolan, 2016) and the promise of
precision therapeutics in immunology (Ashley, 2015; Collins
and Varmus, 2015; Friedman et al., 2015), have together
propelled a rapid increase in the production of large-scale immu-
nological data. Similar advancements in other fields, such as
genomics, where high-throughput assays spurred a swell of
data, have demonstrated the need and benefit of common refer-
ence datasets. Resources such as the 1000 Genomes Project
(1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010, 2012; Sudmant
et al., 2015), Health and Retirement Study (https://hrs.isr.
umich.edu/), Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (Burton
et al., 2007), and Exome Aggregation Consortium (Lek et al.,
2016) have accelerated discovery of thousands of disease-
linked variants and uniquely enable understanding of global
variation in the human genome in health and disease. To date,
however, human immunology has no such resource. As publicly
available immunological data continue to grow, there is a need in
the field for a framework in which those data can be accumulated
and normalized, allowing researchers to explore the space of ex-
isting data and generate testable hypotheses.
The challenge in generating such a resource lies, in part, in the
diversity of data types available to immunologists. A reference
‘‘immunome’’ might reasonably include flow cytometry, gene
expression, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type, cytokine mea-
surements, clinical assessments, and more. Furthermore, stan-
dardized protocols for measurement and conventions for naming
cell types and cytokines are only currently being developed, and
adherence is inconsistent (Finak et al., 2016). For the experimental
or clinical immunologist, the cost of generating the necessary data
fromscratch—orthetemporalandcomputationalcostsassociated
withstandardizingandharmonizingdatafrompubliclyavailableco-
horts across platforms, time points, and institutions—is prohibitive
without significant resources. Thus, although the benefit of a com-
monreferencepopulation isclear, andlarge-scaledata arepublicly
available, this need has not yet been met.
Other lessons from the field of genomics offer additional
direction and promise. For example, resources like the 1000
Genomes Project (1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010,
2012; Sudmant et al., 2015) have clearly demonstrated the ne-
cessity of exploring and accounting for human diversity; the
publication of the original data release has been cited more
than 5,000 times. Additionally, although high-throughput assays
invariably suffer from inter-experiment technical variation, the
field has generated and validated statistical methods for over-
coming those artifacts while preserving the underlying effects
of interest (Hughey and Butte, 2015; Johnson et al., 2007; Leek
and Storey, 2007; Leek et al., 2010; Pelz et al., 2008). These
breakthroughs, ripe for translation to immunological data, have
unlocked the potential for deeper insight beyond the initial intent
of each of the thousands of studies that have made their raw data
publicly available to researchers.
Given the recent growth in open immunology data, we sought
to establish a structure for synthetically constructing a reference
‘‘immunome’’ by integrating individual-level data from publicly
available immunology studies. For this initial version, we began

 by manually curating the entire public contents of ImmPort (Data
Release 21; http://www.immport.org/), the archival basic and
clinical data repository and analysis platform for the National
Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) (Bhattacharya
et al., 2014; Dunn et al., 2015). ImmPort contains studies on a
diversity of topics related to immunity, including allergy, trans-
plant, vaccinology, and autoimmune disease, and the data rep-
resented are diverse, ranging from flow cytometry and ELISA to
clinical lab tests and HLA type. While most of these studies were
not designed to examine the diversity of the healthy normal im-
mune system, they nonetheless contain healthy control arms
that we utilized for this purpose.
Our goal was to include in the reference only human subjects
from the healthy control arms of studies and only samples from
individuals that have undergone no experimental manipulation.
Our filtering and data harmonization process resulted in an inau-
gural dataset consisting of 10 data types in standardized tables
(mass cytometry [cytometry by time of flight; CyTOF], flow
cytometry, multiplex ELISA, gene expression array, clinical lab

collected from the NIAID Immunology Data and

ImmPort to filter for normal healthy control human

atically processed and harmonized. These data

from 10,344 subjects. We unify the data
from all the normal healthy immunomes
into a fully open and interactive online
resource
(http://www.10kimmunomes.

>4,200 distinct users. We expect that
the ability to dynamically visualize the

immunology. We further show that this
resource can provide a basis for studying
immunity across age, sex, and racially
diverse populations. The ImmPort Data

nance of the project as an arm of

the open-data movement.
RESULTS
Development of the 10KIP
To develop the 10KIP, we began with ImmPort Data Release 21
(downloaded May 3, 2017), which contains 242 studies released
to the public, with 44,775 subjects and 293,971 samples (Fig-
ure 1). We began by manually curating each of these 242 studies,
reading inclusion and exclusion criteria, and selecting by hand
which study arms and planned visits constitute data collected
on samples from normal healthy human subjects prior to any
experimental immune perturbation. This manual curation pro-
cess resulted in aninaugural population of 10,344 subjects, span-
ning 83 studies. An exhaustive list of all studies, arms, and
planned visits that qualified for inclusion is available as Table S1.
This dataset consists of 10 distinct data types (flow cytometry,
high-throughput serum protein measurements, gene expression,
514
Cell Reports 25, 513–522, October 9, 2018
 clinical lab tests, and others). For each of the 10 data types, we
developed a standardized pipeline for data cleaning and harmo-
nization (see STAR Methods). Although the ImmPort environ-
ment boasts an exceptional degree of annotation, massively
multi-study analysis still required substantial effort in data
harmonization. Across all studies, we standardized analyte
names and units of measurement, segregated data by sample
type (e.g., peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs] versus
whole blood versus serum), and corrected for differences in sam-
ple dilutions. This process resulted in standardized data tables,
which form the backbone of the reference. The normalized
data and their raw counterparts are available for visualization
and download at http://10kimmunomes.org/ (Figure S6).
Contents of the Inaugural Release of the 10KIP
The initial release of the 10KIP contains 10,344 subjects. They
are approximately evenly split between male and female, repre-
sent a diverse racial makeup, and include more than 1,000 pedi-
atric subjects (<18 years of age) and over 1,300 subjects above
65 years of age (Figure S1). As enumerated in Table 1, the
resource contains secreted protein data from over 4,800 sub-
jects, clinical lab test data from over 2,600 subjects, flow cytom-
etry or mass cytometry data from over 1,400 subjects, hemag-
glutination inhibition (HAI) titers from over 1,300 subjects, and
HLA types from over 1,000 subjects, in addition to several other
data types. Because many subjects contribute more than one
type of measurement, the total number of subjects across all
measurement types substantially exceeds the number of distinct
subjects. Data are available in ‘‘formatted’’ or ‘‘normalized’’ for-
mats. ‘‘Formatted’’ data are segregated by biological sample
type and harmonized to include standardized units of measure-
ment and analyte names, but these data are not batch corrected.
‘‘Normalized’’ files are the batch-corrected versions of the
formatted data (STAR Methods). Individuals wishing to verify
the batch correction may view a whole-data visualization of
each data type (Figure S5), view the effect of study on every an-
alyte individually on http://10kimmunomes.org, or to download
the formatted data and conduct their preferred method of batch
correction.
Multiplex ELISA Measurements across the Population
The regulation of immune system components through cyto-
kines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and growth factors is
central to maintenance of a healthy immune homeostasis and
response to acute infection (Becher et al., 2017; Mackay,
2001; Neurath, 2014; O’Shea et al., 2002). Recent advances in
the measurement of such secreted proteins with multiplex ELISA
(also known as multiplex bead-based analysis or by the trade
name Luminex) allow for high-throughput profiling of the immune
molecular milieu (Morgan et al., 2004; Vignali, 2000). Similar to
high-throughput measurements of RNA expression, however,
this type of measurement must be interpreted with caution,
due to inter-experimental technical variation, as well as differ-
ences in reagents and platforms used (Djoba Siawaya et al.,
2008). In fact, there is contention within the field of computational
immunology regarding the validity of directly comparing high-
throughput serum cytokine measurements across studies
(Khan et al., 2004; Rosenberg-Hasson et al., 2014).
Here we suggest, however, that previously described models
for statistical compensation for batch effects in genomics are
sufficient for analysis of multiplex ELISA data. We find that,
without batch correction, technical variation contributes signifi-
cantly to the clustering of multiplex ELISA data as visualized by
t-SNE (Figure 2A). The empirical Bayes algorithm ComBat (John-
son et al., 2007), originally designed for analysis of microarray
data, compensates for both mean and variance differences
across studies while preserving potential effects of interest,
such as differences by age, sex or race (Figures 2B and S2).
We have additionally confirmed the efficacy of this strategy
through 1,000-fold simulations of multiplex ELISA data with
mean, variance, and single-analyte batch effects (Figure S2).
This strategy preserves known effects, such as a significantly
higher serum leptin concentration in women as compared to
men (Figure 2C; Dubuc et al., 1998).
Additionally, the ability to combine data across studies from
disparate geographic locations and distinct ethnic populations
enables us to uncover demographic diversity in cytokine and
chemokine expression. We have systematically analyzed the
multiplex ELISA data and report all significant associations after
accounting for multiple comparisons (Figure S3). Strikingly, we
find that 10 out of the 50 most commonly measured cytokines,
chemokines, and metabolic factors measured by multiplex
ELISA differ significantly by race (Figures 2 and S3). Nineteen
differ significantly with age and 3 by sex. To highlight one
example, our analyses indicate a significantly higher level of
C-X-C motif chemokine 5 (CXCL5) among African Americans
as compared to other races (Figure 2D). Interestingly, CXCL5
has been implicated in a number of disorders that disproportion-
ately affect African Americans, including acute coronary syn-
drome (Sirak et al., 2008; Zineh et al., 2008), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (Kirkpatrick and Dransfield, 2009; Qiu et al.,

 2003), asthma (Joseph et al., 2000; Qiu et al., 2007), and insulin
resistance (Chavey et al., 2009; Spanakis and Golden, 2013).
Finally, this analysis from a population of up to 1,286 individuals
across 17 studies (STAR Methods) allows us to describe the dis-
tribution of serum cytokine measurements in a diverse human
population (Figure 2E). Some, such as interleukin-5 (IL-5) and
IL-7, lie within a relatively small range, whereas others, such as
chemokines C-C motif chemokine 4 (CCL4) and (CXCL9),
display a many-fold range, even within this population of putative
healthy normal human subjects. Together, these findings affirm
the benefit of maintaining and growing a diverse common control
population for the future of clinical and precision immunology.
Individual-Level Cell-Subset Measurements across the
Population
Similarly, even within this reference population, we find a high
degree of variability in the proportion of immune cell subsets
from PBMCs as measured by mass cytometry. This variability
in cell subsets within a normal healthy population corroborates
previously reported descriptions of cell-subset percentages
(Brodin and Davis, 2017). CD4+, CD8+, and gamma-delta T cell
subsets, in particular, span a wide range as a percentage of total
leukocytes. Smaller subsets, such as memory B cells and plas-
mablasts, span a tighter range (Figure 3A). For high-throughput
analysis of mass cytometry data, we have employed a pipeline
(MetaCyto) that begins with raw flow cytometry standard (fcs)
files, enacts quality control, implements automated gating based
on a standard set of markers, and reports a standardized set of
cell-subset percentages as a proportion of total leukocytes
(STAR Methods; Hu et al., 2017). In a prior publication, we uti-
lized this pipeline to enumerate a number of associations be-
tween race and cell-subset percentages from analysis of publicly
available data (Hu et al., 2017).
Here, we describe the effects of age (Figures 3B and 3C), sex
(Figures 3D and 3E), and race (Figure S4) in this larger healthy
normal population. In total, we find that four of the 24 measured
cell types differ significantly by race (Figure S4), 20 change
significantly with age (Figures 3B and 3C), and 7 vary significantly
by sex (Figures 3D and 3E). As an example, our analysis reveals a
pronounced decline in naive CD8+ T cells with age (Figure 3C)
with a concomitant increase in memory CD4+ T cells (Figure 3C).
These findings are anticipated given the accumulation of antigen
exposures over the lifespan. Our analysis additionally suggests
that women have significantly higher levels of naive CD4+
T cells, naive CD8+ T cells, naive B cells, and plasmablasts
than male subjects while having a significantly smaller proportion
of effector CD8+ T cells (Figures 3D and 3E). We additionally find
that natural killer (NK) cells are found at a significantly higher level

 in Asian subjects than white subjects and that regulatory T cells
are measured at a significantly higher level in African American
subjects as compared to all other races (Figure S4). These
age, sex, and race-related differences in immune cell subsets
may help explain population differences in infections and auto-
immune disease or impact clinical decision-making as it pertains
to treatment selection. Developing and continuing to grow a
diverse reference of immune measurements specifically enables
this type of discovery.
Systems-Level Network Analysis of Cellular and
Molecular Immunity
In addition to characterizing the diversity of the immune system
in terms of cellular and molecular markers, a framework such as
the 10KIP also has the potential to facilitate systems-level
network analysis. We selected 321 individuals from the dataset
for which immune cell subsets in PBMCs and protein measure-
ments of serum cytokines, as measured by mass cytometry
and multiplex ELISA, respectively, were assessed in the same
biological samples. We modeled the partial correlation between
each cell type and each cytokine, statistically controlling for age,
sex, and race (Figure 4), all of which our analyses suggest can
have significant effects on cellular and molecular immune reper-
toire (Figures 2 and 3), and then display only those correlations
that remain significant at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01
following Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction. Although we
recognize the potential for generating a network that incorpo-
rates additional data types, such as gene expression, as an initial
demonstration, we restrict ourselves to a bipartite network of
cells and cytokines, generating a rich but interpretable network.
Our analysis recovers some known relationships; for example,
we see that effector CD4+ T cells function as a major hub in the
network, contributing positive associations with known Th2 cy-
tokines IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 (Wynn, 2003). We additionally
see a negative association between regulatory T (Treg) cells
and the pro-inflammatory CSF3 (formerly granulocyte colony
stimulating factor [GCSF]), consistent with the known immuno-
modulatory role of Treg cells (Belkaid and Rouse, 2005; Vignali
et al., 2008). We detect an association between CXCL10 and
monocyte subsets, concordant with evidence that this cytokine

 is expressed by and acts to recruit monocytes (Lee et al., 2009).
Furthermore, acute phase reactants interferon alpha-2 and IL-6
are negatively associated with central memory CD8+ T cells
and memory B cells, which is concordant with the understanding
of the kinetics of the transition from acute inflammation to mem-
ory formation (Huber and Farrar, 2011). This exploratory analysis
of the cell-cytokine network in the normal, healthy immune sys-
tem also generates testable hypotheses about human immune
function. For example, this analysis suggests a positive associa-
tion between leptin and transitional and memory B cells, connec-
tions that are potentially of interest given B cell expression of the
leptin receptor and the recent discovery that B cells may pro-
mote insulin resistance (La Cava and Matarese, 2004; Winer
et al., 2011). Furthermore, this connection through memory
B cells extends to the adipokine resistin and to the adhesion mol-
ecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, a cluster of molecules also known
to be affected by adiposity (Procaccini et al., 2013; Skilton et al.,
2005; Verma et al., 2003). These analyses together demonstrate
the utility of this framework for generating systems-level hypoth-
eses from publicly available immunology data collected for a va-
riety of disparate purposes.
Use as a Common Control Population for Precision
Immunology in Pregnancy
Finally, to illustrate the potential of the 10KIP to serve as a com-
mon control group for clinical studies, we used an age- and sex-
matched subset of the 10KIP to compare with immune measure-
ments in pregnancy, derived from ImmPort study SDY36. In this
ImmPort study, researchers collected rich clinical data, as well
as flow cytometry and serum cytokine measurements, from a
population of 56 women during each trimester of pregnancy,
6 weeks postpartum, and 6 months postpartum. Cell count
data from this study, as well as trends in cytokine secretion
from cultured cells, have been published previously (Kraus
et al., 2012). Changes in serum cytokine levels over gestation
and analyses of cell-subset percentages (which are potentially
differentially affected during pregnancy; Ekouevi et al., 2007),
however, remain undescribed as of this writing. Additionally,
the study design did not incorporate a pre-pregnancy control,
leaving open the question of whether cell subsets and serum cy-
tokines truly return to baseline by 6 months postpartum. Given
work demonstrating persistence of fetal cells and DNA in
maternal blood and brain many years postpartum (Bianchi
et al., 1996; Chan et al., 2012), the comparison to a common
healthy control has the potential to enrich our understanding of
the immune system in pregnancy and maternity.
We first applied principal-component analysis (PCA) to the
serum cytokine measurements, which revealed a major shift in
cytokine regulation during the first trimester of pregnancy as
compared to second and third trimester measurements, post-
partum measurements, and measurements taken from age and
sex-matched 10KIP controls (Figure 5A). This shift is primarily
driven by increased concentrations of CCL2, CCL3, CCL4,
CCL5, CCL11, CXCL10, and IL-6. As an example of this modu-
lation, we see that CCL5 concentration is significantly increased
during the first and second trimester and is decreased during the
third trimester and up to 6 weeks postpartum, but it returns to
baseline by 6 months postpartum (Figure 5B). In contrast,
IL-15 measurements remain relatively constant over the entire
course of gestation (Figure 5C).
In addition to analysis of serum cytokine concentrations, we
also examined changes in cell-subset percentages in preg-
nancy. PCA analysis of flow cytometry measurements indicated
that changes in cell subsets over the course of gestation are not
the primary source of variation as compared to postpartum or
reference measurements (Figure 5D). This is not to say, however,
that cell subsets remain static over the course of pregnancy. We
see, for example, that CD4+ T cells, as a percent of lymphocytes,
undergo a significant increase during all three trimesters of preg-
nancy as compared to the 10KIP reference population (Fig-
ure 5E). B cells, in contrast, exhibit a small but significant dip dur-
ing the second and third trimesters (Figure 5F). Although we
recognize that, to date, ImmPort does not contain dense data
for all measurement types, this analysis demonstrates that the
size and scope of even this initial version of the 10KIP are suffi-
cient to generate age- and sex-matched control cohorts for two
types of high-throughput immune measurements as a baseline
or comparator to immune perturbation or disease.
DISCUSSION
Although the availability of large common control cohorts, such
as the 1000 Genomes Project (1000 Genomes Project Con-
sortium, 2010, 2012; Sudmant et al., 2015) and the Wellcome
Trust Case Control Consortium (Burton et al., 2007), has proven
immensely useful for various biological research communities,
no parallel resource exists for immunological measurements.
Here, we produced, through manual curation and study-by-
study harmonization, the 10,000 Immunomes Project (10KIP), a
framework for growing a standardized reference dataset for
the immunology community. To enable its use by experimental
and clinical immunologists, we developed an interface for inter-
active data visualization, as well as custom cohort creation and

across different platforms, or at distant institutions by repurpos-
ing algorithms developed in computational genetics.
We not only recover many known differences by age and sex
across serum cytokine and cell-subset measurements but also
reveal differences, particularly by race, that would have been
impossible to uncover without the combination of dozens of in-
dependent datasets generated to answer varied and unrelated
questions in immunology. Through network analysis, we addi-
tionally demonstrate the utility of the resource for generating

Figure 5. Comparing Pregnancy Data to the Common Control Reveals Cell-Subset and Immune Protein Modulation in Pregnancy
(A) PCA plot depicting the variation in serum proteins, as measured by multiplex ELISA, over the course of pregnancy, taken from ImmPort Study SDY36, as
compared to multiplex ELISA measurements from women between the ages of 18-40 from the reference population. The variance in measurements is dominated
by a deviation in serum cytokine measurements during the first trimester (teal) relative to all other time points during pregnancy and relative to the 10KIP controls
(green). These differences are driven primarily by changes in CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL11, IL6, and CXCL10.
(B) As an example of cytokine modulation in pregnancy, serum CCL5 levels are significantly increased in the first and second trimester relative to the
10KIP controls, decrease during the third trimester and remain low for at least 6 weeks postpartum. CCL5 levels return to baseline levels by 6 months postpartum
(ANOVA with Tukey HSD, n = 142 controls, n = 57 pregnancy, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
(C) In contrast, serum IL15 levels make no significant deviations from normal over the course of pregnancy (ANOVA with Tukey HSD, n = 142 controls, n = 57
pregnancy).
(D) PCA plot depicting the variation in immune cell subsets, as measured by flow cytometry, over the course of pregnancy, taken from ImmPort Study SDY36, as
compared to cytometry measurements from women between the ages of 18 and 40 years from the 10KIP controls. As opposed to cytokine measurements (A), the
preponderance of variation in cell-subset measurements is not due to changes over the course of pregnancy. All time points during and following gestation
substantially overlap with the controls (green).
(E) The percentage of CD4+ T cells, as a fraction of lymphocytes, is significantly elevated over the duration of pregnancy but returns to baseline in the postpartum
period (ANOVA with Tukey HSD, n = 94 controls, n = 57 pregnancy, *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001).
(F) The percentage of B cells, as a fraction of lymphocytes, exhibits a small but significant dip in the second and third trimesters (ANOVA with Tukey HSD, n = 94
controls, n = 57 pregnancy, *p < 0.05).
(B, C, E, and F) The central line indicates the mean. Edges of the box represent the 25th and 75th percentile of the data. The upper whisker represents the
smaller of the maximum value and the 75th percentile + 1.5 3 the interquartile range. If the latter, outliers are represented by individual points. The lower
whisker represents the larger of the minimum value and the 25th percentile � 1.5 3 the interquartile range. If the latter, outliers are represented by individual
points.

 insights into cell-cytokine relationships in the human immune
system. Finally, we demonstrate that the size and scope of
the extant publicly available data are sufficient for custom cohort
selection, enabling us to generate a reference cohort of
women between the ages of 18 and 40 years who have both
cell-subset and serum cytokine data available on the same blood
samples for comparison with an external dataset derived from
measurements taken during pregnancy. Generating a sufficiently
powered sex- and age-matched population with multiple
immune measurements for comparison allowed us to explore
the cell-subset and cytokine changes that occur as the immune
system is modulated over the course of gestation. We expect
that as more and more measurements are uploaded to NIAID’s
ImmPort database, the 10KIP will expand into an increasingly
powerful resource for future clinical and preclinical immunolog-
ical studies.
While we recognize the ideal would be to recruit and collect im-
mune measurements from a large cohort, the resources and time
required to collect immunologic measurements from a suffi-
ciently sized heterogeneous population would be considerable,
while this sizable volume of subject-level human immunology
data are currently available to the research community. We also
acknowledge further potential limitations in this work. For
example, we are selecting subjects, standardizing labels and
units, and otherwise curating the data with the best available in-
formation on these studies, but it is possible errors in the original
data descriptions or labeling might persist. Also, we present the
data after normalization and batch correction, but of course, we
recognize that all of these source datasets were collected inde-
pendently across institutions, technologies, and time. It is
possible that our normalization efforts and assumptions might
not hold true for every analysis in every study. On the other
hand, the large inter-study variation (see Figure S5) supports
the idea that the batch-corrected consensus may be more robust
than the results of each study taken separately. We also note that,
to date, some data types might not be measured densely enough
to make reliable models that span all ages or races, and to date,
racial information in ImmPort is acquired at a relatively coarse
grain. Additionally, some highly sought data types, such as
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), are not yet available in sufficient
volume in ImmPort to merit inclusion in the initial release of
the resource. As high-throughput immunological techniques
become more widely available and as experimentalists continue
to deposit these data in ImmPort, however, this scaffold will
continue to grow, enabling well-powered analyses on more spe-
cific populations and over an increasing number of data types
with time.
Finally, we want to recognize current reference datasets for
immunology. The extant resources, while of clear import to the
research community, serve different purposes than does the
10KIP. ImmGen (Shay and Kang, 2013), for example, repre-
sents an immense resource of immune gene expression in
murine models, while the 10KIP instead focuses on multiple
data types in human immunology. Likewise, ImmuneSpace
(Sauteraud et al., 2016) provides a suite of visualization and
analysis tools, allowing users to interact and download data
at the level of individual human immunology studies. The
10KIP, in contrast, has as its primary goals to filter the extant
data for only healthy normal subjects and enable visualization
and analysis across many studies. The 10KIP takes full advan-
tage of the structure of ImmPort, in which subjects are as-
signed a unique accession number and are associated with
their age, sex, and race. The resource allows researchers to
subset the population or to look for associations with these
general demographic phenotypes. Additionally, it leverages
the richness of data available through ImmPort, which encom-
passes soluble protein and cytokine measurements, such as
multiplex ELISA, cell-phenotyping measurements such as
flow-cytometry and CyTOF, standard medical laboratory test
panels, gene expression data, and others. We believe that
integrating these datasets and presenting them as a fully
open resource will pay dividends in terms of both basic
research and the precision and robustness of ongoing transla-
tional efforts in immunology.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Subjects were extracted from Data Release 21 of ImmPort database, which contains 242 open-access studies, together comprising
44,775 subjects and 293,971 samples. Each subject in ImmPort is assigned a unique identifier, allowing every measurement in the
ImmPort database to be assigned to a unique subject. Each subject has, at minimum, race, age, and sex demographic information.
The ImmPort data architecture requires that each study contain detailed descriptions of inclusion and exclusion criteria for subjects.
Additionally, each arm (experimental and control arms) of each study is assigned a unique accession. Finally, each experimental
measurement is time stamped with a unique planned visit accession. Manual review of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, arms, and
planned visits allowed us to select control subjects, and to examine only those measurements taken before the onset of any exper-
imental manipulation, such as vaccine, drug, or surgery that may have occurred. A complete list of qualifying studies, arms, and
planned visits contained in the 10KIP is available in Table S1.
METHOD DETAILS
Extract Immune Cell Frequencies from Cytometry Data
Meta-analysis of Cytometry data is conducted using the MetaCyto package (Hu et al., 2017). Briefly, flow cytometry data and CyTOF
data of healthy human blood samples from ImmPort studies SDY89, SDY112, SDY113, SDY144, SDY167, SDY180, SDY202,
SDY212, SDY296, SDY305, SDY311, SDY312, SDY314, SDY315, SDY364, SDY368, SDY387, SDY404, SDY420, SDY472,
SDY475, SDY478, SDY514, SDY515, SDY519, SDY702, SDY720, and SDY736 were downloaded from ImmPort web portal. Flow
cytometry data from ImmPort were compensated for fluorescence spillovers using the compensation matrix supplied in each fcs
file. All data from ImmPort were arcsinh transformed. For flow cytometry data, the formula f(x) = arcsinh (x/150) was used. For CyTOF
data, the formula f(x) = arcsinh (x/8) was used. Transformation and compensation were done using the preprocessing.batch function
in MetaCyto (Hu et al., 2017). The cell definitions from the Human ImmunoPhenotyping Consortium (Finak et al., 2016) were used to
identify 24 types of immune cells using the searchClster.batch function in MetaCyto. Specifically, each marker in each cytometry
panels was bisected into positive and negative regions. Cells fulfilling the cell definitions are identified. For example, the CD14+
CD33+ CD16- (CD16- monocytes) cell subset corresponds to the cells that fall into the CD14+ region, CD33+ region and CD16- region
concurrently. The proportion of each cell subsets in the PBMC or whole blood were then calculated by dividing the number of cells in
a subset by the total number of cells in the blood. Differences by age, sex, and race were detected with a linear model, with Tukey’s
Honestly Significant Difference (Tukey’s HSD) post hoc tests and Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction for false discovery rate.

 Multiplex ELISA analysis
Secreted protein data measured on the multiplex ELISA platform were collected from ImmPort studies SDY22, SDY23, SDY111,
SDY113, SDY180, SDY202, SDY305, SDY311, SDY312, SDY315, SDY420, SDY472, SDY478, SDY514, SDY515, SDY519, and
SDY720. Data were drawn from the ImmPort parsed data tables using RMySQL or loaded into R from user-submitted unparsed
data tables. Across the studies that contribute data, there are disparities in terms of the dilution of samples and units of measure
in which the data are reported. We corrected for differences in dilution factor and units of measure across experiments and standard-
ized labels associated with each protein as HUGO gene symbols. This step represents the ‘‘formatted’’ multiplex ELISA data table.
For our own analysis, as represented in Figure 2, we analyzed only those proteins that were measured in more than half of the sub-
jects leaving the 50 most-commonly measured proteins. Compensation for batch effects was conducted using the ComBat function
of the R package sva, with study accession representing batch and a model matrix that included age, sex, and race of each subject.
Data were log2 transformed before normalization with ComBat to better fit the assumption that the data are normally distributed (Fig-
ure S6). We verified that a linear model associating age, sex, ethnicity, and study accession of each subject no longer revealed any
significant associations between study accession and protein concentration following batch correction, and that known differences,
such as the difference in leptin concentration by sex, were captured following our batch correction procedure. We additionally vali-
dated our approach using 1000-fold data simulations (see below). Differences by age, sex, and race were detected with a linear
model, with Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference post hoc tests and Benjamini-Hochberg correction for false discovery rate.
For dimensionality reduction analysis, which is not robust to missing values, missing values were imputed by k-nearest neighbors,
using impute.knn with default values.
Network Analysis
The bipartite network depicted in Figure 4 represents an analysis over the 24 immune cell subset percentages calculated in the mass
cytometry analysis described above in Extract Immune Cell Frequencies from Cytometry Data and the 50 soluble protein measure-
ments, normalized and batch-corrected as described above in Multiplex ELISA analysis. Data were included from the 321 subjects
where both multiplex ELISA and mass cytometry measurements were conducted on the same biological sample. Edges depict the
Spearman’s r of a partial correlation between each cytokine concentration and each individual cell type, accounting for age, sex, and
race. Only correlations that remained significant at a BH-corrected p < 0.01 are shown.
Cell and cytokine modulation in pregnancy
We compared serum cytokine and cell subset percentages from 10KIP samples to measurements taken from women during and
after pregnancy. We selected samples from the 10KIP from women aged 18-40 who contributed CyTOF data from PBMC and multi-
plex ELISA measurements. Samples from pregnancy were taken from ImmPort study SDY36. The serum cytokine and flow cytometry
from SDY36 was batch corrected together with the ImmPort reference data, using the default parameters of the ComBat algorithm,
and including age, sex, race, and time point in pregnancy in the model while using study accession as a surrogate for batch. Because
SDY36 measured a smaller number of cytokines and cell subsets than are available as part of the 10KIP, we further selected a subset
of the 10KIP to include just those parameters measured in SDY36. These data were used to conduct standard PCA analysis
(R: prcomp, ggbiplot). Differences were calculated using ANOVA with a Tukey’s HSD post hoc test.
Gene expression array harmonization and normalization
Gene expression array data were obtained in three formats. For data collected on Affymetrix platforms, we utilized the ReadAffy utility
in the affy Bioconductor package to read in raw CEL files. The rma utility was used to conduct Robust Multichip Average (rma) back-
ground correction (as in (Irizarry et al., 2003)), quantile normalization, and log2 normalization of the data. For data collected on Illumina
platforms and stored in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we utilized the getGEO utility in the GEOquery Bioconductor
package to read the expression files and the preprocessCore package to conduction rma background correction, quantile normal-
ization, and log2 normalization of the gene expression data. Finally, for data collected on Illumina platforms but not stored in GEO, we
utilized the read.ilmn utility of the limma Bioconductor package to read in the data, and the neqc function to rma background correct,
quantile normalize, and log2 normalize the gene expression data. In all instances, probe IDs were converted to Entrez Gene IDs.
Where multiple probes mapped to the same Entrez Gene ID, the median value across probes was used to represent the expression
value of the corresponding gene. The background-corrected and normalized datasets were combined based on common Entrez IDs,
missing values were imputed with a k-nearest neighbors algorithm (R package: impute, function: impute.knn) using k = 10 and default
values for rowmax, colmax, and maxp. To create the normalized and batch corrected dataset available through the www.
10kImmunomes.org portal, we utilized a well-established empirical Bayes algorithm for batch correction (Johnson et al., 2007),
compensating for possible batch effects while maintaining potential effects of age, race, and sex across datasets and mapped Entrez
IDs to HUGO gene IDs.
Simulations to validate the batch correction algorithm
The empirical Bayes algorithm we have used to generate the normalized data available for download has previously been validated in
its use for gene expression microarray analysis (Johnson et al., 2007). To assess the efficacy of using an empirical Bayes algorithm to
compensate for batch effects in multiplex ELISA data, we generated simulated multiplex ELISA data as skewed normal distributions
e2
Cell Reports 25, 513–522.e1–e3, October 9, 2018
 from a set of parameters selected to mimic those skewed normal distributions that best fit the actual multiplex ELISA data used in our
analysis. We generated this data for 50 analytes and 1500 subjects and purposefully introduced batch effects intended to mimic the
types of batch effects we might encounter in real multiplex ELISA data. To account for use of a differently calibrated machine, for
example, we simulated data in which one batch had a higher mean than the other batches. To account for the possibility that one
lab’s data might be more variable than others, in one simulation we introduced random noise into one batch of the data. Finally,
to account for the fact that the antibodies used may differ in efficacy across lots and experiments, we devised a simulation in which
just one analyte in just one batch has a perturbed mean. In each of 1000 simulations of this data, we then generated a linear model to
test whether the empirical Bayes algorithm ComBat (Johnson et al., 2007) would successfully correct for these deviations from the
true value of the simulated data. Additionally, we took the largest single batch of multiplex ELISA data (data from ImmPort study SDY
420) and intentionally introduced the same 3 types of batch effects we introduced into the simulated data. Following the same pro-
cedure, we demonstrate that ComBat successfully removes these introduced batch effects from real multiplex ELISA data.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Detailed descriptions of data collection and modeling are available in the Method Details section. All publicly available software is
enumerated in the Key Resources table. Statistical tests used, p values of those tests, and the n of each test are detailed in the figure
legends. In all cases, n represents the number of distinct human subjects represented in the test. In PCA and tSNE plots, each point
represents an individual human subject. In violin plots, each black dash represents an individual human subject. The width of the
violin can be read as a histogram, representing the density of subjects at each value. The length of the violin represents the range
of values. In ribbon plots, each point represents an individual human subject, while ribbons indicate the mean and standard error
of each group as a loess-smoothed curve, as implemented in the geom_smooth aesthetic of the R ggplot2 package. In forest plots,
each point represents the effect size the variable of interest (age, sex, or race) has on the measured values, while the error bars repre-
sent the standard error of that estimate. In boxplots, the central line indicates the mean, the edges of the box represent the 25th and
75th percentile of the data. The upper whisker represents the smaller of the maximum value and the 75th percentile + 1.5 * the inter-
quartile range. If the latter, outliers are represented by individual points. The lower whisker represents the larger of the minimum value
and the 25th percentile - 1.5 * the interquartile range. If the latter, outliers are represented by individual points.
