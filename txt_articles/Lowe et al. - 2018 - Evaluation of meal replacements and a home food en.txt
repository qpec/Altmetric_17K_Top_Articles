ABSTRACT
Background: Lifestyle change treatments for weight loss produce
medically meaningful weight reductions, but lost weight is usually
regained. Meal replacements (MRs) represent one avenue for im-
proving long-term weight loss. Another, nutrition-focused approach
involves having participants make specific changes in the energy den-
sity, composition, and structure of the foods in their personal food
environments.
Objective: Three conditions were compared: behavior therapy (BT),
BT plus MRs (BT+MR), and a nutrition-focused treatment aimed
at modifying the home food environment (HFE).
Design: Overweight and obese individuals (n = 262) were randomly
assigned to 1 of the 3 conditions. Treatment occurred in weekly
groups for 6 mo and in biweekly groups for 6 mo. Assessments were
conducted at baseline and at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 mo. Multilevel mod-
els were used to estimate weight-change trajectories for each partic-
ipant and to examine the treatment group effect on long-term weight
loss.
Results: A multilevel analysis indicated that all 3 groups showed
significant weight loss over 12 mo that was gradually regained to the
36-mo follow-up. Mean ± SD percentages of baseline weight loss at
12 mo for BT, BT+MR, and HFE were 9.41% ± 7.92%, 10.37% ±
7.77%, and 10.97% ± 7.79%, respectively. Comparable percentages
at 36 mo were 4.21% ± 8.64%, 3.06% ± 6.93%, and 4.49% ± 7.83%.
Those in the HFE condition lost more weight than those receiv-
ing BT through the 36-mo assessment (P < 0.01), as reflected in
2 treatment × time interactions. Further analyses showed that HFE
produced the largest increases in cognitive restraint and that this in-
crease largely mediated the HFE group’
s improved weight loss.
Conclusion: The nutrition-focused intervention studied here pro-
duced modestly greater long-term weight loss than BT, an effect that
was largely explainable by an unexpected boost in cognitive restraint
in this condition. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT01065974.

INTRODUCTION
A challenge for the behavioral treatment of obesity is achiev-
ing durable improvements in various self-control skills. This goal
should be furthered by making individuals’ food environments
more compatible with long-term weight loss. Meal replacements
(MRs) represent one way of furthering this goal. MRs are portion-
and calorie-controlled meals that show improved initial weight
loss and weight-loss maintenance (1, 2). A second approach fo-
cuses on making numerous qualitative and quantitative modifi-
cations to nutritional intake. Studies have found support for re-
ducing the energy density (ED) of the diet and manipulating the
glycemic index and the protein content of the diet to increase
weight loss (3–5).
We conducted 2 studies aimed at creating durable improve-
ments in nutritional intake to support weight-loss maintenance.
The first study found that a reduced-ED diet did in fact produce
significantly greater reductions in the ED of the diet but did not
improve weight loss at an 18-mo follow-up (6). In a second study,
we found a significant interaction between the presence or ab-
sence of MRs and the presence or absence of a reduced-ED pro-
gram on long-term weight loss over a 2-y follow-up period (7).
The most successful of the 4 conditions, the diet with reduced
ED but no MRs, maintained virtually all of their weight losses
2 y after the end of treatment.
The first goal of this study was to compare the addition
of MRs during treatment and follow-up with behavior ther-
apy (BT) (8). The second was to test a more comprehen-
sive version of the nutritional intervention referenced above
to improve the durability of weight loss. This expanded in-
tervention, referred to as the Home Food Environment (HFE)
intervention, had 2 major components. First, beyond a fo-
cus on reducing ED, it added nutritional change components
that have shown promise for promoting weight loss, includ-
ing the use of pre-portioned foods (7, 9) (although MRs were

not prescribed), increased protein (10) and fiber (11) intake to
promote satiety, removal of highly tempting foods from the home
(12), and decreasing or increasing the variety of high- or low-
calorie foods, respectively (13). Many of these recommendations
reflect those made in the Volumetrics eating plan (14) and overlap
with stimulus control recommendations (1) and choice architec-
ture approaches (15). Second, most of the group session content
was devoted to providing the rationale for our nutrition-focused
approach and training participants to make specific, agreed-upon
changes to the foods, ingredients, and preparation methods and
portioning techniques each week during most of the program.
BT programs, by contrast, provide similar nutritional advice but
spend much more group session time teaching problem-solving
to improve behavioral and emotional self-control skills.
This single-factor study compared the ability of BT plus MRs
(BT+MR) and the HFE intervention to improve long-term weight
loss relative to standard BT. Conditions were also compared on
ancillary measures to see if the removal of self-control compo-
nents from the HFE condition (relative to BT) had any untoward
effects on auxiliary outcomes.
METHODS
All of the participants were recruited from the community and
treated at Drexel University and the University of Pennsylvania.
During recruitment, participants were screened over the phone,
attended a study orientation, and completed an in-person screen-
ing visit. Simple randomization via a table of random numbers
was used to evenly assign participants to 1 of 3 conditions: BT,
BT+MR, or the novel treatment, HFE. (The numbers 1–3, 4–6,
and 7–9 were used to assign participants to 1 of the 3 conditions.)
All 3 treatments lasted for 1 y. Participants attended 3 follow-up
assessments over the next 2 y. Assessments took place at month 0
(baseline), month 6 (midtreatment), month 12 (end of treatment),
month 18 (6-mo follow-up), month 24 (12-mo follow-up), and
month 36 (24-mo follow-up). All study visits took place between
January 2010 and December 2014. The study was registered at
clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01065974). The study protocol was ap-
proved by the university’
s institutional review board (approval
11090000194).
Study sample
Inclusion criteria for the study were as follows: men and
women between the ages of 18 and 65 y, with a BMI (kg/m2)
between 27 and 45, able to travel regularly to the study location,
and interested in participating in a weight-loss program. Exclu-
sion criteria for the study were as follows: currently enrolled in
another organized weight-loss program, lactose intolerance, tak-
ing medications that affect appetite (unless dosage had been sta-
ble for at least the previous 6 mo), history of gastric bypass or
other surgical weight-loss procedures, medical conditions (e.g.,
cancer, substance abuse, psychotic disorders) that could limit par-
ticipants’ability to comply with the behavioral recommendations
or pose a risk to the participant during weight loss, pregnancy or
planning to become pregnant during the next 2 y, breastfeeding,
and consuming an amount of alcohol that could interfere with
study completion.
Participants were recruited and completed the intervention in 4
separate waves over the course of 3 y (2010–2012), with follow-
up visits completed in 2015. Recruitment took place in the greater
Philadelphia area through radio, newspaper, and online advertise-
ments, brochures, flyers, and e-mails.
Intervention
All of the enrolled participants were randomly assigned to 1 of
the 3 treatment conditions. Basic information about all 3 condi-
tions was provided at the initial study orientation, but participants
were not otherwise informed about the details of treatment in con-
ditions to which they were not assigned. All of the group sessions
were 75 min in length, and group leaders in all conditions spent
the same amount of time with participants.
The BT treatment is considered the current “gold standard”
for achieving medically meaningful weight losses in obese in-
dividuals (1). This condition used materials from the Lifestyle,
Exercise, Attitudes, Relationships, and Nutrition (LEARN) man-
ual and the Diabetes Prevention Program (16, 17). The BT+MR
treatment added an MR component to this standard treatment
(18, 19). Participants were instructed to consume 2 MRs/d dur-
ing the first 6 mo of the study (breakfast and lunch were recom-
mended) and to switch to 1 MR and 1 snack replacement between
6 and 12 mo. To facilitate adherence, all MRs and snack replace-
ments (SlimFast) were provided by the study at no cost to the
participant during the treatment year.
The HFE condition consisted of several components. First,
weight loss was instigated in the usual way—that is, by identify-
ing a caloric goal, discussing various means of reducing caloric
intake, and beginning self-monitoring of food intake to keep track
of food consumed and identify sources of problematic food in-
take. Second, parts of the first 8 wk of treatment were spent pro-
viding the rationale behind the HFE treatment: that a combination
of personal vulnerability to weight gain and regain, the limitations
of self-control skills for long-term weight management, and the
temptations inherent in the obesogenic environment underlies the
strong emphasis of HFE on making numerous changes to partic-
ipants’personal food environments (2). Third, an overview was
provided on research findings on the effects on eating and weight
control of the ready availability of highly tempting, hyperpalat-
able foods in the home; the ED of available foods (including the
recommendation to start meals with a low-ED food); food por-
tioning; increasing the protein and fiber contents of foods; and
increasing the variety of low-ED foods and decreasing the vari-
ety of high-ED foods. Fourth, there were weekly homework as-
signments wherein participants identified specific foods and food
ingredients whose modification or removal would further ≥1 of
the aforementioned goals of reducing energy intake while main-
taining the volume of food that participants were accustomed
to consuming, with the goal of lowering daily caloric intake by
≥300 calories/d to support maintenance of lost weight. Foods tar-
geted for modification were identified through group exercises,
participants’ self-monitoring forms, and by having participants
bring to the group session their grocery store receipts. Group
leaders repeatedly explained that the goal of the HFE program
was to maintain the tastefulness of foods as much as possible
while moderating the ED of selected foods and meals and in-
creasing the consumption of lower-ED foods. There was exten-
sive discussion of how HFE principles could be extended to foods
eaten outside of the home. However, the emphasis was placed on
making sufficient changes to foods in participants’personal food

environments so that they did not need to depend as much on
maintaining a consistently high level of eating self-control to
maximize weight loss and avoid weight regain (2).
Treatment sessions, which lasted 1 y, were led by a group
leader and co-leader. Treatment focused on weight loss for
months 1–6 and gradually shifted to prevention of weight regain
during months 7–12.
Group leaders were all either PhD holders or PhD candidates
in at least their third year of study. Group sessions were recorded
and reviewed with the principal investigators.
In the event that a participant missed a session, the group leader
or co-leader attempted to conduct an in-person make-up session.
When this was not possible, phone make-up sessions were con-
ducted instead.
We attempted to enhance retention through regular contact
with participants. When necessary, this was supplemented by
contacting friends and family members to maximize participant
retention.
Measures
Weight was measured at the clinic visit and at every assessment
by using a digital Seca scale. Height was measured without shoes
and was used to calculate BMI. Assessors were not blinded at
treatment visits but were blinded at the 6 assessments.
A number of additional measures were administered to check
whether the HFE intervention produced inferior outcomes rela-
tive to the 2 behaviorally based interventions. This was done be-
cause little of the traditional behavioral curriculum was taught in
the HFE condition and so we felt it was important to conduct non-
inferiority tests to see if this difference resulted in reduced bene-
fits from HFE. Because these measures were used simply to test
the noninferiority of the HFE condition, they are only described
briefly here.
Physical activity
The Paffenbarger Physical Activity Scale was used to assess
physical activity based on time spent in light-, moderate-, and
vigorous-intensity activities over the past month (20).
Quality of life
The Impact of Weight on Quality of Life Scale–Lite assessed
the impact of obesity on 5 aspects of quality of life: physical func-
tion, self-esteem, sexual life, public distress, and work (21).
Binge eating
The Binge Eating Scale, specifically designed for use in obese
individuals, assessed the severity of binge-eating behaviors (22).
Disinhibition and cognitive restraint
Two subscales of the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-
Revised 18 item (TFEQ-R18) were administered. The uncon-
trolled eating subscale evaluates hunger-driven overeating and
binge eating and the cognitive restraint subscale measures cogni-
tive and behavioral tendencies aimed at limiting food intake (23).
Food addiction
The Yale Food Addiction Scale measures addictive-like
thoughts and behaviors pertaining to highly palatable foods (24).
Body satisfaction
The Body Shape Questionnaire assesses concerns about feel-
ings of fatness and general body shape (25).
Food cravings
The General Food Cravings Questionnaire–Trait assesses gen-
eral food cravings across 4 domains (26).
Eating self-efficacy
The Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire, a 20-item ques-
tionnaire, measures self-efficacy for controlled eating related to
weight management across 5 domains: food availability, nega-
tive emotions, physical discomfort, positive activities, and social
pressure (27).
Depressive symptoms
The Beck Depression Inventory–II was used to assess depres-
sive symptoms (28).
Statistical analysis
Power calculations are dependent on both an expected dif-
ference between treatment arms as well as the clustering of the
data (repeated observations within an individual with ≤6 repeated
measures/participant within 1 of the 3 treatment conditions), re-
sulting in a multilevel model structure. By using the method de-
scribed by Raudenbush and colleagues (29–31), and implemented
with the software Optimal Design, power calculations were made
for this multilevel model structure. From our power analysis, a
sample size of 249 (83 for each group) was required for 80%
power to detect a medium effect size, with a significance level
of 0.05 and 6 assessment points, assuming the ratio of the vari-
ability of the level 1 coefficient to the variability of the level 1
residual is 1.
Descriptive statistics of baseline characteristics were com-
puted for each treatment group. Baseline characteristics were
compared between 3 treatment groups by using ANOVA (or non-
parametric Kruskal-Wallis, as appropriate) for continuous vari-
ables and chi-square test for categorical variables. Sample size
calculations were based on the minimal sample needed to detect
the predicted condition by time interaction, given average effect
sizes from similar past research.
Multilevel models were used to estimate weight-change tra-
jectories for each participant and to examine the treatment group
effect on weight loss. Multilevel models are not restricted to indi-
viduals with complete data at every time point or data measured at
the same times for all individuals (32). Analyses were performed
on an intent-to-treat basis. Multilevel models are preferable to
analyses based on last observation carried forward because of
their enhanced power and approach to handling missing data (33).

4There were no significant differences in the proportions of racial/ethnic groups across conditions.
The percentage of weight change at each occasion was exam-
ined as the primary outcome. To capture the nonlinear pattern of
growth over time, the best-fitting function of time from a family
of flexible polynomial functions was selected—namely, time ef-
fects with powers of −1 and −2 (1/time and 1/time2) (34). Model
fitting was evaluated by using the Bayesian information crite-
rion, Akaike information criterion, and Deviance information cri-
terion. Occasion-level repeated measures (level 1) were nested
within participants (level 2). Cross-level interactions between
time effects and treatment condition were included to examine
how treatment group effect influences the individual growth tra-
jectories. Baseline characteristics were also considered as time-
invariant covariates in the multilevel model. Model-based effect
sizes for differences in means between 2 independent groups in
multilevel models were computed on the basis of the regression
framework outlined by Feingold (35).
For reasons explained below, cognitive restraint was examined
as a mediator of treatment group effect on percentage of weight
loss. The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) macro
PROCESS was used to examine the significance of this media-
tor. The significance of mediation effects was assessed by bias-
corrected bootstrap CIs. The absence of zero in the CI indicates
significant mediation effects.
Multilevel models were also used to examine whether the
change trajectories on the self-report measures were different
across treatment conditions (i.e., the noninferiority tests). To eval-
uate cognitive restraint as a mediator, we used the mediation
model outlined by Preacher and Hayes (36, 37) to estimate the to-
tal and specific indirect effects. This approach expands on Baron
and Kenny’
s methods by providing additional guidelines and
techniques that allow for the most robust and accurate interpreta-
tion of these mediating effects (38).
Analyses were conducted by using R, version 3.3.3, and SPSS,
version 23.0. All reported P values are based on 2-sided hypothe-
ses, and a significance level of 0.05 was used for all analyses.
RESULTS
The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials)
diagram showing the number of individuals who participated in
the study from initial recruitment through the follow-up assess-
ments is shown in Supplemental Figure 1. Retention at different
assessment points ranged from 69.5% at the 36-mo assessment to
84.3% at the 6-mo assessment. Baseline characteristics of the par-
ticipants are summarized in Table 1. Participants had a mean ±
SD age of 49.79 ± 10.68 y (range: 21–65 y) and a mean ± SD
weight of 214.97 ± 38.51 pounds, and 80.5% (n = 211) were
women. No significant differences in these baseline characteris-
tics were identified between the 3 treatment groups.
From multilevel analysis, both the reciprocal of a linear time
effect (P < 0.001) and the reciprocal of a quadratic time effect
(P < 0.001) were significant for all 3 groups, suggesting that
participants experienced significant, initially rapid reductions in
weight, which gradually reversed over time (see Tables 2 and 3).
We then examined possible covariates as well as the treatment
condition effect on weight change over time. The addition of
age, height, income, and education as covariates did not sig-
nificantly improve the fit of the model. As shown in Table 3,
the interactions between time effects and the treatment condi-
tion were significant when comparing the HFE group with the
BT group (interaction between 1/time and condition: b = 8.21,
P = 0.009, effect size = 0.85; interaction between 1/time2 and
condition: b = −8.2, P = 0.012, effect size = −0.97). The com-
bination of these 2 effect sizes, −0.12, reflects the modest size
of the BT/HFE difference. The 2 interaction terms reflect the fact
that weight changed over time in a nonlinear fashion. The com-
bined effect of the 2 interaction terms on weight loss is shown in
Figure 1; the only significant condition differences indicated that
participants in the HFE group experienced greater weight loss
over the course of the study than participants in the BT group.

It should be pointed out, however, that this conclusion was sup-
ported statistically despite the fact that there was more conver-
gence between conditions evident in the raw means (e.g., in
Table 2, the HFE condition showed less mean weight loss than
BT at the 24-mo assessment). The interactions were not signif-
icant when contrasting the HFE group with the BT+MR group
and contrasting the BT+MR group with the BT group (Table 3).
For the tests of noninferiority, the only significant difference
obtained was for the Cognitive Restraint scale (P = 0.02) (the
results of these multilevel analyses are shown in Table 4). As
shown in Figure 2, the HFE group showed a larger sustained in-
crease in cognitive restraint than the other 2 conditions. Given
this, we then tested whether changes in cognitive restraint me-
diated the greater weight loss seen in the HFE condition. From
multilevel analysis, both the reciprocal of a linear time effect
(P = 1.54 × 10−50) and the reciprocal of a quadratic time effect
(P = 1.72 × 10−63) were significant for all 3 groups, suggest-
ing that participants experienced significant, initially rapid reduc-
tions in weight, which gradually reversed over time (see Tables 3
and 4). Mediation analyses revealed cognitive restraint as a sig-
nificant mediator of the treatment group effect on percentage of
weight loss at the end of the treatment. Participants in the HFE

up. Participants in the HFE group (n = 81) experienced greater weight loss

group were estimated to have 89% more weight loss, on average,
than participants in the BT group as a result of the positive effect
of the HFE condition on percentage of cognitive restraint increase
(unstandardized coefficient = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.2, 2.1).
DISCUSSION
We tested the hypotheses that the addition of MRs to a stan-
dard behavioral weight-loss intervention, and a nutrition-focused
intervention that promoted various changes in foods kept in in-
dividuals’personal food environment, would promote long-term
weight loss better than standard BT. A main effect of treatment
condition and the absence of an interaction with time indicated
that a significant separation in weight loss between conditions
was achieved and that this difference did not change over the 2-y
follow-up period. Those in the HFE condition lost more weight
and maintained more weight loss than those in the BT condition;
results for those in the BT+MR condition were in between those
of the other 2 conditions but did not differ significantly from ei-
ther of them.
The degree of separation in weight loss between the groups
was modest and unlikely to make a meaningful difference in the
health conditions associated with obesity. Thus, the implications
of the findings are more conceptual than clinical. One implication
of the findings is that the switch from BT’
s focus on improving
self-control skills to HFE’
s focus on participants making specific
nutritional changes in their home environments more than made
up for any reduction in the efficacy of the standard behavioral
curriculum that might have otherwise occurred. Thus, no poten-
tial benefits of BT were sacrificed in order to expand HFE’
s focus
on nutritional and food environment changes.
Cognitive restraint, the one noninferiority measure that did dif-
ferentiate the 3 groups, showed the largest, most prolonged in-
crease in the HFE condition. This effect was not expected. A
mediation analysis indicated that the greater increase in cogni-
tive restraint accounted for nearly all of the weight-loss advan-
tage of HFE over BT. These effects were not predicted, but the
fact that the increase in cognitive restraint was maintained over
multiple follow-up assessments suggests that this difference was
robust. We believe that the most likely explanation for this ef-
fect involved the perspective on self-control that was presented
throughout the HFE intervention. Although some self-control is
required in any lifestyle-change weight-loss program, HFE con-
ceptualized self-control as necessary but wholly insufficient for

reasons that de-emphasized building self-control skills and em-
phasized a nutrition-focused approach in participants’treatment.
These included the powerful genetic determinants of obesity, the
difficulty of sustaining weight losses in an obesogenic environ-
ment, the tendency of the body to treat pretreatment weight as a
kind of set point, and the automatic and pervasive effects that food
cues have on self-control after weight loss. Discussing this infor-
mation was sobering but was not meant to discourage or blame
participants. Rather, we emphasized the need to gain control over
food cues and the availability, composition, and form of foods in
their personal food environment as counterweights to the chal-
lenges of sustaining weight losses. In short, we suggested that by
making multiple changes to their food environment, they would
be reducing the need to perpetually exercise self-control to main-
tain the weight they lost.
We surmise that this evidence-based enumeration of the ob-
stacles standing in the way of weight-loss maintenance had the
effect of rousing feelings of reactance in the HFE participants.
That is, our explanation of all the reasons why it is so hard for
people to lose weight and maintain the loss may have motivated
participants to “push back” against this message by increasing
their vigilance over eating. If this explanation for the increase in
cognitive restraint in the HFE condition is correct, then it would
be more than a little ironic. That is, by questioning the usefulness
of building self-control skills and detailing the internal and exter-
nal threats to successful self-control, the HFE treatment may have
bolstered the very capacity it was meant to downplay—stronger
self-control with regard to food, measured here as cognitive re-
straint.
The BT+MR condition achieved impressive weight reductions
during the first year but its long-term weight-loss outcomes did
not statistically differ from the other 2 conditions. This condition
showed larger mean weight losses than BT at the 12- and 18-mo
assessments but lower losses at the 1- and 2-y follow-ups. How-
ever, it was not statistically different than the other 2 conditions.
This outcome replicates our previous finding (7), but both results
diverge from past work that found that MRs significantly increase
weight loss (3).
There are several additional implications of the current find-
ings. First, the cognitive restraint findings imply that the rationale

FIGURE 2
Estimated change in cognitive restraint scores over time for
the 3 treatment groups with the use of multilevel models. The HFE group
(n = 81) showed a larger sustained increase in cognitive restraint than the
BT (n = 90) and BT+MR (n = 91) groups. In addition, participants in the
HFE group were estimated to have 89% more weight loss on average than
participants in the BT group as a result of the positive effect of the HFE
condition on the percentage of increase in cognitive restraint (unstandardized
coefficient = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.2, 2.1). The combined group means ± SDs for
the 0-, 6-, 12-, 18-, 24-, and 36-mo visits were 11.57 ± 2.48, 14.20 ± 2.73,
14.00 ± 2.73, 13.52 ± 2.73, 13.10 ± 2.78, and 13.00 ± 3.02, respectively.

provided to HFE participants may be worth pursuing as a means
of enhancing the kind of long-lasting dietary vigilance that could
facilitate sustained weight losses. That is, by emphasizing the ar-
ray of factors that make lasting weight loss so difficult, it may
help individuals to mentally and behaviorally prepare to cope
with these factors. Second, it is important to distinguish between
the characteristics of BT that the HFE intervention did and not
duplicate. The HFE intervention did retain the critical underpin-
nings of group sessions and group support, regular meetings, goal
setting, weekly weigh-ins, and dietary self-monitoring. However,
it removed most of the behavioral focus on building self-control
skills (e.g., coping with stress) and teaching problem solving to
help participants overcome motivational, behavioral, and emo-
tional challenges to weight loss. This suggests that a treatment
that retains some critical underpinnings of BT but excludes most
of the curriculum of BT can produce prolonged weight losses that
match or exceed those achieved by traditional BT. Third, it is no-
table that the rate of weight regain shown by the HFE group, rel-
ative to the other 2 treatment conditions, did not accelerate over
the 2 y of follow-up. That is, the statistical analyses indicated that
the curves modeling weight trajectory during follow-up did not
show a tendency toward convergence. In past studies of weight-
loss treatments, a condition that initially produced greater weight
loss and then weight regain has tended to catch up to comparison
treatments so that the different treatments become more indis-
tinguishable as the length of follow-up grew. Thus, if the longer-
lasting benefits of the HFE treatment can be replicated, this would
represent another positive feature of this treatment modality.
The retention rate of participants ranged from a high of 84%
at 6 mo to a low of 70% at the 2-y follow-up. This represents a
relatively good retention rate. Furthermore, the use of multilevel
modeling allowed us to include all individuals with ≥1 observa-
tion in the analysis, which provides increased power and the abil-
ity to detect nonlinear trends across multiple time points. Another
strength of this study is its inclusion of 2 y of follow-up data. A
weakness of the methodology was that, because of its novelty,
more supervision of group leaders occurred in the HFE condition
than in the other 2 conditions. The additional supervision given
to group leaders in the HFE condition might have contributed to
the better weight-loss outcomes achieved. Another weakness is
that all of the outcome measures of exercise and eating behavior
were based on self-report.
In sum, the results of this study indicate that a nutritionally
focused treatment produced better long-term weight losses than
standard BT. This treatment also produced larger increases in
cognitive restraint, an effect that accounted for some, if not all, of
the additional weight-loss benefit produced by the HFE interven-
tion. The HFE condition did not appear to reduce ancillary psy-
chological and behavioral benefits associated with BT. Future re-
search should explore ways of improving the HFE treatment and
the development of ways to make sustained nutritional change
easier and more acceptable to those receiving this treatment.
