BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: There is little randomised evidence using a whole food plant-based (WFPB) diet as intervention for
elevated body mass index (BMI) or dyslipidaemia. We investigated the effectiveness of a community-based dietary programme.
Primary end points: BMI and cholesterol at 6 months (subsequently extended).
SUBJECTS: Ages 35–70, from one general practice in Gisborne, New Zealand. Diagnosed with obesity or overweight and at least
one of type 2 diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia. Of 65 subjects randomised (control n = 32,
intervention n = 33), 49 (75.4%) completed the study to 6 months. Twenty-three (70%) intervention participants were followed up at
12 months.
METHODS: All participants received normal care. Intervention participants attended facilitated meetings twice-weekly for 12 weeks,
and followed a non-energy-restricted WFPB diet with vitamin B12 supplementation.
RESULTS: At 6 months, mean BMI reduction was greater with the WFPB diet compared with normal care (4.4 vs 0.4, difference:
3.9 kg m− 2 (95% confidence interval (CI) ± 1), Po0.0001). Mean cholesterol reduction was greater with the WFPB diet, but the
difference was not significant compared with normal care (0.71 vs 0.26, difference: 0.45 mmol l − 1 (95% CI ± 0.54), P = 0.1), unless
dropouts were excluded (difference: 0.56 mmol l − 1 (95% CI ± 0.54), P = 0.05). Twelve-month mean reductions for the WFPB diet
group were 4.2 (±0.8) kg m −2 BMI points and 0.55 (±0.54, P = 0.05) mmol l− 1 total cholesterol. No serious harms were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: This programme led to significant improvements in BMI, cholesterol and other risk factors. To the best of our
knowledge, this research has achieved greater weight loss at 6 and 12 months than any other trial that does not limit energy intake
or mandate regular exercise.

INTRODUCTION
Background
Globally, the obesity epidemic worsens.1,2 In 2014 more than 600
million adults were obese and a further 1.9 billion adults were
overweight.3 In New Zealand, 31% of adults are obese and 35%
are overweight.4 A raised body mass index (BMI) is associated with
many forms of cancers; type 2 diabetes (T2DM); osteoarthritis;
obstructive sleep apnoea; a shorter life expectancy; a lower quality
of life and cardiovascular disease.2,3,5,6 Additionally, these diseases
impose a significant financial burden on both the health-care
system and the wider economy.7
Many individuals attempt to lose weight by making changes to
their diet, and commercial weight loss programmes are part of a
multibillion-dollar market.8 Reviews of dietary interventions for
weight loss fail to demonstrate superiority of one diet over
another.8–10 In one review of 48 trials comparing commercial
interventions, both low-carbohydrate and low-fat diet approaches
were deemed effective at 6 months; participants lost on average
8 kg, with 1–2 kg regained at 12 months.10 Massive weight loss
has also been achieved through a very high carbohydrate (⩾90 %
dietary energy), calorie-restricted 'Rice Diet' as far back as 1940.
This extremely restrictive approach has shown in one case series
an average 63.9 (SD ± 17.2) kg weight loss for 106 patients.11,12
The whole food plant-based (WFPB) diet is high in micronutrient
density and the most frequently researched iterations are low in
fat, which comprises approximately 7–15% of total energy.13–15
Interventions using the WFPB diet (alone, or with exercise and
stress reduction) have demonstrated: reversal of ischaemic heart
disease, improvements in glycaemic control, weight loss, long-
term acceptability and sustainability, and reduction of prostate-
specific antigen in biopsy-proven low-grade prostate cancer.16–22
Other nonclinical implications deserve attention. A WFPB diet
generally requires less land, energy, and water than a diet high in
animal products.23 On a per calorie basis, a high-meat diet
(4100 g per day) produces 2.5 times more greenhouse gas
emissions than a vegan diet.24 Farming the estimated 70 billion
land animals consumed annually contributes between 14.5 and
51% of total human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, more
than all of transportation.23,25–28
Objective
We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of our community-
based WFPB
dietary
programme in
a population
of New
Zealanders. Our programme was unique because we focused on
creating long-term behavioural changes through developing
practical skills (especially cooking).13,16,17,19

 SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Study overview
The BROAD study was a prospective, two-arm, parallel, superiority study
run from August 2014 to initially February 2015 (subsequently extended).
We compared standard medical care (control) with standard medical care
plus a diet change programme (intervention).
Recruitment of participants
The intervention involved patients from a group general practice in
Gisborne, the region with New Zealand’s highest rates of socioeconomic
deprivation, obesity and type 2 diabetes.29,30 Inclusion criteria were age
35–70 and either obese (BMI⩾30 kg m−2) or overweight (BMI⩾25 kg m−2),
with a diagnosis of one of type 2 diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, or the
cardiovascular risk factors of hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia (for
definitions see Table 1, baseline characteristics). Participant exclusion
criteria were diagnoses of life-threatening comorbidities; thyroid disease;
coronary artery bypass grafting within 6 weeks; myocardial infarction
within 1 month; angioplasty within 6 months; 450% stenosis of the left
main coronary artery; unresponsive congestive heart failure; malignant
uncontrolled arrhythmias; homozygous hypercholesterolaemia; severe
mental health disorders; current alcohol or drug misuse; currently smoking;
currently pregnant or breastfeeding women, prior bariatric surgery, other
conditions that directly affect weight (e.g. lead toxicity, malignancy).
Enrolment
We invited 693 candidates by letter in May 2014 and sent a reminder to
450 non-responders 1 month later. The letter included consent for EMR
screening, general and nutritional self-efficacy questionnaires, a question
on self-esteem, and three questions on readiness for change.31–33 Doctors
reviewed the EMR and confirmed eligibility. The research coordinator
conducted 116 interviews, and explained randomisation, the WFPB diet
and showed examples of appropriate meals. Candidates listed the benefits
and downsides of allocation to either trial group before providing written
consent. We randomised 65 participants total (Figure 1).
Intervention
Intervention participants followed a low-fat plant-based diet (approxi-
mately 7–15% total energy from fat).13 We chose a low-fat iteration of the
plant-based diet as this has been shown with previous research to achieve
optimal outcomes, especially for heart disease and weight loss.13,14,17,18
This dietary approach included whole grains, legumes, vegetables and
fruits. Participants were advised to eat until satiation. We placed no
restriction on total energy intake. Participants were asked to not count

aFrom information on electronic medical records (EMR) system. bBody mass
index is calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the
height in metres. cType 2 diabetes mellitus was defined by the New
Zealand standard, HbA1c ⩾ 50mmol mol − 1 cutoff. dIschaemic heart disease
included prior coronary stenting; prior coronary artery bypass grafting
(CABG); prior cardiovascular ischaemic event; or antianginal medication
use. eHypertension included pre-treatment BP4140/90 mm Hg or current
antihypertensive medication prescription. fHypercholesterolaemia included
those with pre-treatment total cholesterol 46mmol l − 1 or current
cholesterol-lowering medication prescription. gTo convert values for total,
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL) from mmol l − 1 to mg dl − 1, multiply by 38.67, for
triglycerides multiply mmol l − 1 by 88.57. hThe cardiovascular disease risk
calculator estimates the risk of a cardiovascular event occurring within a
5-year period, using age, current HbA1c, duration of type 2 diabetes, sex,
smoking status, ethnicity, total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ratio, systolic
BP and status regarding use of BP lowering medication. iWe used the Short
Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) for quality of life assessment and responses
were scored using Optum Scoring Software v4.5. For 3-day food recall each
‘red category’ or ambiguous food item scored one point, e.g. pasta with
meat (1) and cheese (1) = 2, values reflect total over 3 days. Exercise units
were average for 3 days using minutes of exercise × rated perceived
exertion, where value shown is in hundreds, that is, 32 in table = 3200.
Food enjoyment, self-efficacy and readiness for change used a 1–4 Likert
scale, with 4 being highest. Pooled answers had maximum score: 16 for
food enjoyment, 40 for general self-efficacy and 20 for nutritional self-
efficacy. Self-esteem was a single question using a 1–5 Likert scale, with
1 as highest.

 calories. We provided a ‘traffic-light’ diet chart to participants outlining
which foods to consume, limit or avoid (Supplementary Table S1). We
encouraged starches such as potatoes, sweet potato, bread, cereals and
pasta to satisfy the appetite. Participants were asked to avoid refined oils
(e.g. olive or coconut oil) and animal products (meat, fish, eggs and dairy
products). We discouraged high-fat plant foods such as nuts and avocados,
and highly processed foods. We encouraged participants to minimise
sugar, salt and caffeinated beverages. We provided 50 μg daily vitamin B12
(methylcobalamin) supplements. The intervention group attended 2-h
evening sessions twice-weekly for 12 weeks. We ran sessions at a

(Supplementary
Table

Special
events
included
screening
the
documentary 'Forks Over Knives' and an accompanying film endorsing
the WFPB diet; discussion sessions; restaurant meals; quiz night; potlucks;
and graduation ceremony. Both intervention and control group partici-
pants received $40 petrol vouchers to cover travel costs and received a
birthday card along with a voucher redeemable for a native plant.
Data collection and measurements
After enrolment was completed, both groups completed the same
questionnaires. We used the Big Five Inventory (BFI 44) personality
assessment for traits associated with adherence.34,35 We used the Short
Form 36 health survey version 2 (SF-36v2) to measure self-perceived health
status. For diet and exercise, we used 3-day recall forms to track dietary
indiscretions and exercise. We averaged daily exercise scores using
participant reported exertion (Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion scale)
multiplied by minutes of exercise.36 We asked four questions to assess
food enjoyment, and calculated food spending by amount divided by
frequency to get the cost per day. We counted regular medications from
the EMR, excluding as needed (PRN) medications except for glyceryl
trinitrate. We discussed prescribing with general practitioners, but general
practitioners made all prescribing decisions. We used an online risk
assessment (CVD RA) calculator to estimate the 5-year risk of a
cardiovascular event.37,38 We used the Behavior Change Technique
Taxonomy to classify aspects of the intervention (Supplementary Table
S3).39 The research coordinator performed measurements using the same
clinic and equipment, with intervention and control measured 1 week
apart. Participants removed shoes and outer clothing. We measured blood
pressure (BP) after 5 min seated using the automated digital Pro 3400 BP
device (Welch Allyn, Auckland, New Zealand) on the left arm. We then
measured height, weight, waist circumference (WC) and a second BP
reading. We measured height standing using a wall-mounted stadiometer
and weighed participants using a calibrated medical scale (Wedderburn
model WM202, Napier, New Zealand). We measured WC standing beside
the participant, pulled snug at the height of the navel. T-Lab Gisborne
conducted all blood testing. We asked participants to fast for 12 h prior.
General chemistry and lipids were measured on the COBAS c6000 (Roche
Diagnostics, Auckland, New Zealand), and HbA1c on the D-10 (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Auckland, New Zealand).
Outcomes
The primary outcomes were BMI and cholesterol. Secondary outcomes
included changes in medication usage, quality of life, cardiovascular risk
factors, cardiovascular events, or progression to surgery, and transfer to a
higher level of care. The initial end point was 6 months. We measured
personality inventory for factors associated with adherence, and collected
data on any harms.
Minor changes to trial design
At the 6-month end point, we observed significant differences between
the intervention and control groups, and we offered the intervention to
the control group. Ethics approval was obtained to extend follow-up to
3 years total, and the protocol was updated.
Randomisation
We randomised participants in the order of interview by 1:1 sequence from
random.org. The allocation was passed to another researcher who
assigned groups. We randomised five married, partnered and related
pairs together.
Blinding
It was not feasible to blind participants. The researcher performing
measurements was aware of allocation. The participants’ usual health-care
providers were not informed of allocation, although they could ask
participants. The statistician was blinded.
Sample size and analysis
We assumed an 80% chance of demonstrating an effect on cholesterol and
BMI at a confidence level of 95% (Po0.05), based on previous research.40
Sample size calculation indicated 30 participants per group. Allowing for a
30% dropout rate, we sought 40 participants per group. However, due to
time constraints we started with 33 intervention and 32 control group
participants. All predefined outcomes were analysed using the pairwise
deletion method. We additionally analysed a subgroup that excluded
intervention dropouts for between-group differences in total cholesterol.
All t-tests were two-tailed. Comparison of results between the two groups
were analysed using unpaired t-test, after performing an f-test to
determine whether the groups of results had variances that were not
significantly different. One set of intergroup differences came close to an
unequal variance; however, analysis on the basis of an unequal variance
did not change the significance of the result. Statistics were analysed
using an external blinded statistician, not otherwise involved in the study,
using Stata (College Station, TX, USA).
RESULTS
Losses and exclusions
During the research, one intervention participant died in a motor
vehicle accident at week 19. One control group participant
reportedly began a plant-based diet from week 6 and continued
in the control group.
Results
Of the 693 total people invited by mail, 65 (9.4%) were
randomised to either intervention or control. At the 6-month
assessment 49 of 65 (75.4%) participants were followed up:
25 (76%) of the intervention group and 24 (75%) of the control.
From the intervention group 23 (70%) were followed up at 1 year
(Figure 1). Baseline characteristics are available in Table 1.
BMI end point
The primary outcome of BMI change was available for 25 (76%)
participants in the intervention group and 24 (75%) in the control
at 6 months. Individual BMI changes over time are shown in
Supplementary
Figure
S1.
Intervention
and
between-group
reductions in BMI and weight were statistically significant at all
measurement points (all Po0.0001, unless stated) (Tables 2 and 4).
At 6 months mean intervention BMI reduction was 4.4 (range
0.4–7.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.7–5.1) kg m−2, and at
12 months this was 4.2 (range 0.5–8.3, 95% CI 3.4–5) kg m−2. From
6 to 12 months intervention BMI increased non-significantly by 0.4
(range − 1.3 to 4, 95% CI − 0.1 to 0.9, P = 0.12) kg m−2. For weight,
intervention reduction at 6 months was 12.1 (range 1.4–27.3, 95%
CI 9.9–14.3) kg, and at 12 months was 11.5 (range 1.6–28.3, 95% CI
9–14) kg. Within the control group, there were no significant
reductions in BMI at 3 (P = 0.2) or 6 months (P = 0.18) (Table 3). At
6 months the between-group analyses showed differences of 3.9
(95% CI ± 1) kg m−2, and 10.6 (95% CI ± 2.9) kg, which favoured the
intervention.
Cholesterol end point
The primary outcome of cholesterol change was available for 25
(76%) participants in the intervention group and 23 (72%) in the
control at 6 months. Individual cholesterol changes over time are
shown in Supplementary Figure S2. Within the intervention group
mean reduction in total cholesterol was statistically significant at
all time periods, although there was a smaller effect size with time:
at month 3 it was 0.95 (95% CI 0.51–1.39, Po0.001) mmol l− 1; at
month 6 it was 0.71 (95% CI 0.28 to 1.14, Po0.01) mmol l − 1; and
at month 12 it was 0.55 (95% CI 0.01–1.09, P = 0.05) mmol l − 1.
In the control group we observed a statistically significant
mean reduction in total cholesterol at month 3, at 0.28 (95% CI
0.05–0.52, P = 0.03) mmol l − 1, but this was not significant by
month 6, at 0.26 (95% CI − 0.10 to 0.62, P = 0.15) mmol l − 1.
Comparing standard care plus dietary programme (intervention)
to standard care (control) at month 6, our analysis showed a

 nonsignificant reduction in total cholesterol at 0.45 (95% CI − 0.09
to 1.00, P = 0.10). Post hoc subgroup analysis for total cholesterol
difference excluding intervention group dropouts showed a
significant reduction of 0.56 (95% CI ± 0.54, P = 0.05) mmol l − 1,
which favoured the intervention. Statistically significant between-
group HDL-cholesterol differences were seen from baseline to
6 months at 0.25 (95% CI ± 0.15, Po0.0001) mmol l − 1.
Secondary end points
Medication data were available at 6 months for 62 of 65 (95%)
participants via the GP EMR. Control group medications increased
from 74 to 80 over 6 months, an 8% increase, and intervention
group medication usage decreased from 94 to 74 at 6 months,
and to 67 over 12 months: a 29% decrease (Supplementary
Table S4).
Cardiovascular risk factors
The CVD RA within the intervention group decreased slightly from
baseline to 3 months; 0.4% (95 CI ± 0.3, P = 0.02), and the between-
group difference was significant 0.6% (95% CI ± 0.4, P = 0.02).
There were no other significant differences observed for CVD RA.
The HbA1c between-group differences favoured the intervention,
with a reduction of 5 (95% CI ± 3, Po0.001) mmol mol − 1 at
6 months. From baseline to 12 months the intervention average
HbA1c reduced by 5 (range − 1 to 15, 95% CI ± 2, Po0.0001)
mmol mol − 1. For the intervention group, two people with
diabetes
no
longer
met
diagnostic
criteria
(i.e.
HbA1c
⩾ 50 mmol mol − 1) at both 6 and 12 months. Higher starting
HbA1c correlated with a larger subsequent reduction to 3, 6 and
12 months (correlation tests, Po0.01 or less). Intervention WC
reduced compared with baseline at all time periods (Table 2). No
changes were seen in the control group (Table 3), and between-
group differences demonstrated 10 (95% CI ± 4, Po0.0001) cm
greater mean intervention reduction at 6 months. There were no
transfers to higher-level care or acute admissions for cardiac-
related care for any participant during the first 12 months of the
research.
Quality of life and other variables
Quality of life showed significant improvements in the interven-
tion group for all measurement periods in both the ‘physical
component summary’ and the ‘mental component summary’
(Table 2). The control group showed significant improvement to
6 months with the physical component summary (P = 0.03)
(Table 3). Between-group differences favouring intervention were
significant at 6 months for both the physical component summary
(P = 0.03)
and
the
mental
component
summary
(Po0.01)
(Table 4). At 6 months no significant between-group differences
were seen for: average daily exercise, food enjoyment or food
costs (Table 4). Statistically significant differences favouring the
intervention were seen at 6 months for general self-efficacy
(P = 0.01), nutritional self-efficacy (Po0.0001) and self-esteem
(Po0.01).
Adherence
Average attendance for intervention evening sessions was 79%.
Dietary indiscretions (diet) over 3 days were used as adherence
measure, and intervention BMI change from 0 to 12 months was
correlated with diet at 3, 6 and 12 months (correlation tests:
Po0.0001, P = 0.04, Po0.001, respectively). Baseline diet was not
related to 12-month BMI change (correlation test, P = 0.84). In the
intervention group, indiscretions increased significantly from 1
(95% CI ± 1) at 3 months to 3 (±1) at 6 months (paired t-test;
Po0.0001), and then increased significantly to 5 (±1) at 1 year

Intervention
adherence vs BMI reduction from 0 to 12 months is shown in
Supplementary Figure S3. In the control group, we observed a
significant decrease in dietary indiscretions from baseline to
6 months (Table 3), although these were much smaller than the
intervention group (Table 2). In the control group there was no
correlation between BMI change from baseline to 6 months and
dietary indiscretions at 0, 3 or 6 months (correlation tests: P = 0.38;
0.88 and 0.57, respectively).
Harms
No serious harms relating to the intervention were reported. One
intervention participant with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes
reported hypoglycaemia from week 1 consuming the WFPB diet,
and his general practitioner reduced, and then later stopped his
insulin. Two intervention participants developed low serum
vitamin B12, which normalised with supplementation. At month 5,
an intervention group participant underwent cholecystectomy for
cholecystitis.
DISCUSSION
This randomised controlled trial compared a 12-week WFPB
dietary programme to normal care alone. The intervention led to
significant and sustained BMI and weight reduction at all
measurement points compared with the control group. To the
best of our knowledge, there are no randomised controlled trials
that have achieved a greater average weight loss over a 6- or
12-month period, without mandating regular exercise or restrict-
ing total caloric intake.9,10,41 The key difference between this trial
and other approaches to weight loss was that participants were
informed to eat the WFPB diet ad libitum and to focus efforts on
diet, rather than increasing exercise. The mechanism for this is
likely the reduction in the energy density of the food consumed
(lower fat, higher water and fibre).42 Multiple intervention
participants stated 'not being hungry' was important in enabling
adherence. Intervention participants were highly adherent with
the dietary changes, although this decreased with time. Diet at
3 months correlated with weight loss at 12 months, but starting
diet did not. These findings suggest an audited diet diary may be
useful to predict success with a WFPB diet, and that those starting
from a typical Western diet could expect similar results.
Our results show a reduction in cholesterol for the intervention
group at all measurement points, and in the control at 3 months
only. Between-group analysis showed statistically significant
differences in cholesterol at 3 months, and at 6 months with
subgroup analysis. The ability to detect differences is potentially
reduced by intervention group reduction in medications, and a
decrease in dietary adherence over time. HbA1c reductions
favoured the intervention and all intervention patients with a
diabetes diagnosis improved while adherent, and two resolved
their condition by HbA1c. At 6 months, the intervention compared
with the control had an increased quality of life (SF-36v2), general
and nutritional self-efficacy, and self-esteem, without significant
changes in food enjoyment, cost or exercise. Total regular
medication usage decreased in the intervention group (94 at
baseline, 74 at 6 months, 67 at 12 months), and increased in the
control group (74 at baseline, 80 at 6 months). CVD RA tools are
widely used in New Zealand, and although we saw intervention
WC, BMI and HbA1c improve, the between-group CVD RA (which
does not account for some of these) did not change significantly.

 Also, HDL-cholesterol tends to decrease on a plant-based diet, and
previous research had shown this 'may not be helpful for
predicting cardiovascular risk in individuals consuming a low-fat,
plant-based diet' .43 Our analysis corroborates that this tool is not
particularly appropriate for those consuming a WFPB diet.
Strengths of this research include randomisation, and the ‘real
world’ nature of the programme, which involved community-
dwelling adults who were provided skills and education but were
responsible for their own food choices. A previous survey
identified a lack of information as the main barrier to beginning
a WFPB diet, and information provision formed a large part of our
programme.44 Factors promoting success in the intervention
group included the 2-week preparation period, individualised
feedback and rapid initial weight loss. Reports from intervention
participants suggest family and acquaintances themselves bene-
fitted from exposure to the WFPB diet.
Limitations include necessarily explaining the WFPB diet to all
participants during informed consent, and perhaps as a con-
sequence, we observed a significant improvement with control
group dietary indiscretions. Increased testing for normal care
participants may have led to more focused treatment, and the
observed lipid reductions, and a reduction in effect size. In our
research, 7 of 65 (11%) participants had a diagnosis of ischaemic
heart disease, and we included participants without a necessarily
elevated HbA1c or cholesterol, so collectively these could have
lessened effect size. As it stands, our average cholesterol
reductions were not necessarily as large as those seen with
previous research. Other research has also evaluated dietary
records in more depth, or used a WFPB diet programme in
combination with exercise or relaxation.17,19,40 Weaknesses for this
research include that the intervention group was not perfectly
adherent. The intervention cholesterol drop was largest at
measurement points when adherence was highest, and as
adherence decreased, cholesterol increased, suggesting a dose–
response relationship. Consumption of ‘green’ category foods was
encouraged, but not monitored, although this could be of benefit.
Our questions for exercise, food costs and dietary indiscretions
involved self-reporting and recall, which could have introduced
error. Another source for introducing inaccuracy was using EMR
ethnicity data, which may have underrepresented rates of Māori
participants. Finally, participant dropouts may have affected
results, although they were roughly equal in both groups.
Our
programme
contrasts
with
other
commonly
used
approaches: exercise and very-low-calorie diets, or bariatric
surgery. Very-low-calorie diets have achieved equal or greater
mean weight loss to that seen in our research.45,46 However,
medically supervised liquid ‘meal replacements’ are not intended
for ongoing use and are associated with 'high costs, high attrition
rates, and a high probability of regaining 50% or more of lost
weight in 1 to 2 years'.47 Increased risks include gallstones, cold
intolerance, hair loss and constipation.46 This contrasts with our
research, whereby many in the WFPB diet group improved in the
9 months following the 12-week intervention. The Cochrane
review of bariatric surgery shows both greater and lesser
reduction in BMI at 12 months compared with our results,
although it tends to favour bariatric surgery.48 One recent study
with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass showed an increased quality of life
after bariatric surgery, but hospitalisation rates were 4–5 times
higher than the comparison group.49 The Cochrane review states
bariatric surgery studies tend to include young, 'low-risk', mainly
female patients and that the 'longer-term impact of surgery on
weight loss or comorbidities is unclear'. Because bariatric surgery
candidates are motivated for change, they could also be suitable
for a WFPB dietary programme. This approach poses no risk of
surgical morbidity or mortality but does require more time with
patients. A WFPB dietary programme can be utilised in centres
where surgery is unavailable, and we estimate cost per patient to
be substantially less than surgery.
Reviews comparing the WFPB approach to other diets show
similar weight loss at 12 months for low-carbohydrate and low-fat
diet approaches.10,50 Individual studies that combine regular exercise
with either unrestricted or energy-restricted low-carbohydrate diets
have observed similar weight loss to our intervention at 6 months:
12.0 (95% CI±1.8) kg;51 and at 1 year: 10.9 (95% CI±1.2) kg,52 and
12.2 (includes telemonitoring, 95% CI±1.3) kg reductions.53 However,
studies on the effects of low-carbohydrate diets have shown higher
rates of all-cause mortality,54 decreased peripheral flow-mediated
dilation,55 worsening of coronary artery disease,56 and increased
rates of constipation, headache, halitosis, muscle cramps, general
weakness and rash.10 Other energy-restricted diets can be effective
for weight loss, for example, one study using a 1 500 kcal daily intake,
with 50% carbohydrate, 30% fat and 20% protein achieved an
average 17.3 (95% CI±1.6) kg reduction in weight at 36 weeks, which
is significantly more than our results.57 However, by restricting
amount of food eaten, patients are likely to feel hungry, and hunger
scores have been shown to predict those at risk of weight regain.58
Low-fat interventions that encourage regular exercise have shown
equal weight loss at 1 year with energy-restricted and non-energy-
restricted approaches: 10.8 kg (95% CI not available and ±1.6,
respectively).17,52
Generalising our results to the community, we felt there were
several key differences. Our study population had a higher number of
females and a higher mean age. Our rates of Māori participants were
less than the Gisborne community and similar to the national average.
We would estimate our participants to have a higher than average
health literacy. To provide longer-term data, we have extended follow-
up to observe the intervention group for 3 years total.
CONCLUSION
Many patients are interested in making dietary changes, and the
WFPB diet can be offered as a safe and effective option for losing
weight and obtaining some reduction in cholesterol, without
necessarily increasing exercise. The main advantage is in eating to
satiation without restricting the amount of food eaten. This small
study also showed several improvements with chronic disease risk
factors and quality of life, which were largely maintained to
12 months. Future research could identify participants who are
currently likely to succeed with a diet change, which could reduce
dropout rates and increase effectiveness. Given the low cost of
this intervention and the relative benefits of this dietary approach,
this could be offered by policy makers and practitioners as
promoting weight loss, and suitable for consumption in hospitals.
