ABSTRACT
Introduction Stem cells have emerged as a new
treatment option for tendon disorders. We systematically
reviewed the current evidence for stem cell therapy in
tendon disorders.
Methods Randomised and non-randomised controlled
trials, cohort studies and case series with a minimum of
5 cases were searched in MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE,
CINAHL, PEDro and SPORTDiscus. In addition, we
searched grey literature databases and trial registers.
Only human studies were included and no time or
language restrictions were applied to our search. All
references of included trials were checked for possibly
eligible trials. Risk of bias assessment was performed
using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for controlled trials
and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for case series. Levels of
evidence were assigned according to the Oxford levels of
evidence.
Results 4 published and three unpublished/pending
trials were found with a total of 79 patients. No
unpublished data were available. Two trials evaluated
bone marrow-derived stem cells in rotator cuff repair
surgery and found lower retear rates compared with
historical controls or the literature. One trial used
allogenic adipose-derived stem cells to treat lateral
epicondylar tendinopathy. Improved Mayo Elbow
Performance Index, Visual Analogue Pain scale and
ultrasound findings after 1-year follow-up compared with
baseline were found. Bone marrow-derived stem cell-
treated patellar tendinopathy showed improved
International Knee Documentation Committee, Knee
injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score subscales and
Tegner scores after 5-year follow-up. One trial reported
adverse events and found them to be mild (eg, swelling,
effusion). All trials were at high risk of bias and only
level 4 evidence was available.
Conclusions No evidence (level 4) was found for the
therapeutic use of stem cells for tendon disorders. The
use of stem cell therapy for tendon disorders in clinical
practice is currently not advised.
INTRODUCTION
T
endon disorders, in particular tendinopathy, is a
frequently seen condition in athletes and in the
general population.1–3 It is defined by localised
swelling, pain and functional limitations of the
affected tendon.4 Several therapies, such as eccen-
tric
exercises,5
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs,6
shockwave
therapy,7–9
corticosteroids,10
platelet-rich plasma11 12 and surgery6 have been
used as treatments for tendinopathy, with variable
levels of evidence and success. Despite some good
results for some of these therapies,5 recalcitrant
cases remain.
More recently, stem cells have entered the field
of tendon disorder treatment. Several reviews have
addressed the current evidence of cell therapy in
tendinopathy and found that mostly small or large
animal studies were available.13–18 Although in
animal studies, there have been positive results in
favour of stem cell treatment, clinical trials have
been scarce and have shown only ‘encouraging
results’.13–18
The current model of chronic tendon disorders
is based on a continuum of degeneration and failed
healing19–21 with a yet unclear role of inflammatory
cells.20 22–24 This model is mainly supported by
histological findings with necrotic and apoptotic
tenocytes,
neovascularisation
and
collagen
dis-
array.19 20 Within this model, the proposed mech-
anism of repair through stem cell use is twofold;
first through these cells’ differentiating capabilities
into new tenocytes they are proposed to generate
new tendon tissue.13
18 Second, the paracrine
effects of stem cells modulate the local immune
response and stimulate repair in the surrounding
cells by the production of growth factors and cyto-
kines.12 25–28
As more and more clinics arise that use stem cell
treatments for a variety of conditions, including
orthopaedic soft tissue disorders such as tendon
disorders,29 and with the increasing number of
trials being published on this topic, we felt it was
necessary to review the current evidence. Our aim
was therefore to systematically review the efficacy
of stem cell therapy for pain and functional out-
comes in the treatment of tendon disorders in
humans.
METHODS
W
e systematically searched for trials that investi-
gated the effect of stem cell therapy of any kind in
tendon
disorders.
Randomised
and
non-
randomised controlled trials, cohort studies and
case series with a minimum of five cases were
searched. Complete selection criteria are reported
in box 1.
Search methods
With the help of a research librarian, a sensitive
search strategy for multiple databases was developed
by one author (MW) (see online supplementary
appendix 1).
Using this strategy, one author (MW) searched all
databases from the databases’ inception up to June
2016. W
e did not impose any restrictions on our
search. W
e searched the following electronic data-
bases: MEDLINE-PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE,
CINAHL, PEDro and SPORTDiscus. Furthermore,
possible
unpublished
and
ongoing
trials

EU
clinical
trial
register
(http://www.
clinicaltrialsregister.eu); ClinicalTrials.gov and the Dutch trial
register (http://www.trialregisters.nl). After inclusion of a trial,
all references were hand searched for possible additional
studies.
Study selection
After deletion of duplicates, two reviewers (HP and MW) inde-
pendently scanned titles and abstracts of all identified studies.
Full-text reports were obtained for potentially relevant studies.
Both reviewers then independently applied the selection criteria
(see box 1). In case of disagreement between reviewers, consen-
sus was sought, and in case of persistent disagreement, a third
party (MHM) was consulted.
Data extraction
Using a standardised data extraction sheet, two authors (HP and
MW) independently extracted the following data: study design,
study setting, inclusion/exclusion, details of the intervention
(such as origin of stem cells used, cell isolation and culturing,
dosage, frequency of administration, etc), primary and second-
ary outcome measures and adverse effects.
In case of disagreement, consensus was reached in a joint
session. If no consensus could be reached, a third reviewer
(MHM) was consulted.
Risk of bias assessment
T
wo reviewers (HP and MW) separately appraised the included
studies for their quality. For randomised and non-randomised
controlled trials, we used Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.30 W
e
appraised each study for the five major domains of bias: selec-
tion bias (random allocation and allocation concealment), per-
formance
bias
(blinding
of
personnel
and
blinding
of
participants), detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment),
attrition bias (follow-up adequacy), reporting bias (complete
outcome reporting) and other biases. W
e adopted previously
used criteria, formulated by Winters et al,31 to score each
domain (see online supplementary appendix 2). Each item was
scored as to be at low (+), high (−) or unclear (?) risk of bias.
Studies were considered to be at low risk of bias when all
domains were scored as low (+) risk of bias, or one item was at
high (−) or unclear risk of bias (?). If two domains were scored
as high (−) or unclear (?) risk of bias, the study was considered
at moderate risk of bias. Finally, when more than two domains
were scored as high (−) or unclear (?) risk of bias, the study was
regarded as being at high risk of bias.
For
case
series,
we
used
a
modified
version
of
the
Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale for cohort studies32
(see online supplementary appendix 3). A maximum of six stars
could be achieved. No quality subdivision (ie, high, moderate,
low risk of bias) was made for case series as these types of study
are a priori at high risk of bias and a quality subdivision would
not affect its level of evidence.
Data synthesis
W
e planned a data synthesis for randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) (>2), when they were at low risk of bias and were clinic-
ally homogenous (ie, identical stem cell type and tendon dis-
order, cointerventions, mode of injection/transplantation). The
mean difference was used for studies that used the same
outcome measurement. Standardised mean differences were
used for studies that used different outcome measures to esti-
mate treatment effects. A p value <0.05 was considered signifi-
cant for all analyses. W
e used a fixed effects model to pool data
that were statistically homogenous, or when <5 studies were
available for data synthesis. A random effects model was used
when statistical heterogeneity was present (heterogeneity was
considered present when the X2—test was significant, p<0.1),
and when >5 studies were available for data synthesis. W
e visu-
ally inspected the forest plots and the heterogeneity statistic (I2).
If heterogeneity was present, and sufficient studies were avail-
able (N≥10), we planned a subgroup analysis or meta-regression
analysis to explore the sources for heterogeneity.
If data pooling was not possible, we presented our findings
by means of a descriptive synthesis using the levels of evi-
dence approach based on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-
based Medicine33 (table 1). Systematic reviews were consid-
ered level 1 evidence, RCTs at low/moderate risk of bias or
observational studies with a dramatic effect were considered
level 2 of evidence, non-randomised controlled trials at low
risk of bias at level 3 of evidence. Case series were considered
as level 4 of evidence impact. Level 5 evidence was considered
only when no studies were available and only mechanism-
based reasoning was available. Studies were downgraded when
they were at high risk of bias with the lowest level for studies
being level 4.

RESULTS
Study selection
A total of 1043 articles were identified during our searches.
After removal of duplicates, 684 singular articles were found.
After title and abstract selection seven articles34–40 were selected
for full-text evaluation (figure 1). T
wo trials37 39 were excluded
because we were unable to determine whether stem cells had
actually been injected as no analyses were performed to investi-
gate whether stem cells were actually present. One article was
excluded40 because it was mostly in vitro and had no data of
interest.
One
article38
because
it
concomitantly
injected
platelet-rich plasma and included patients with osteoarthritis.
Three articles34–36 met the inclusion criteria. Hand searching
revealed no additional articles. One additional article41 was
identified by hand searching previously published reviews evalu-
ating stem cell use in tendon disorders.
Four possibly unpublished studies42–45 were identified but
after contacting the principal investigators, no data were made
available. One unpublished trial42 was found to be published36
and had already been included in the results. T
wo unpublished
trials43 45 were finalised at the time of writing the manuscript
(June 2016). The final unpublished trial44 was mentioned to be
recruiting, but this could not be verified with the author.
Study characteristics
The characteristics of the included studies are summarised in
table 2. One matched non-randomised study35 and three case
series were included for review.34 36 41
A total of 79 patients were treated with two types of stem
cells. The mean ages of the patients ranged from 24 to 61 years
and the percentage of women ranged between 50% and 64%.
T
wo studies34 35 evaluated the use of bone marrow-derived stem
cells as an additive treatment for rotator cuff repair. One
study36 investigated the use of allogenic adipose-derived stem
cells in lateral epicondylar tendinopathy. The last study41 investi-
gated the use of bone marrow-derived stem cells in patellar
tendinopathy.
Harvesting
methods
were
homogenous
across the
bone
marrow-derived trials with collection occurring from the anter-
ior iliac crest.34 35 41 After harvesting, the bone marrow aspirate
was concentrated using a variety of techniques and then injected
in the patient.34 35 41 None of these trials performed culturing
or cell typing. One trial35 confirmed the presence of stem cells
by counting the number of colony-forming fibroblasts in the
samples. One trial34 counted the number of CD34 positive and
mononuclear cells in its samples using flow cytometry. The last
trial41 used uncharacterised nucleated cells obtained from bone
marrow aspirations.
The remaining study36 harvested allogenic adipose-derived
stem cells from healthy donors’ subcutaneous fat tissue. After
aspiration, the lipoaspirate was purified and tested for viral, bac-
terial or fungal contamination. Culturing of the stromal vascular
fraction was performed but the characterisation of stem cells
was unclear. Before the cells were released for injection, a viable
cell count was performed and purity of the cell line was assessed
(80% viable cells and <1% CD45 positive cells as minimal cri-
teria for release). Patients were injected locally using a double
system syringe with fibrin clot to ensure local entrapment within
a fibrin matrix.
Risk of bias
Three studies34 36 41 were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa
scale and one35 using the Cochrane Risk of bias tool. The
motivation for the assessors’ judgements can be found in online
supplementary appendix 4.
The study by Hernigou et al35 was found to be at high risk of
bias (figure 2). All domains were at high or unclear risk of bias.

 Owing to this high risk of bias the study was downgraded to
level 4 evidence.
The number of stars awarded for case series ranged between
two and four (figure 3). No quality subdivision was made. All
studies lacked blinded outcome assessment and were unclear
about the recruitment procedure.
Tendon disorder types and outcomes
Lateral epicondylar tendinopathy
One study36 investigated the use of allogenic adipose-derived
stem cells in 12 patients with lateral epicondylar tendinopathy.
There were statistically significant positive results compared
with baseline at all time points (6, 12, 26 and 52 weeks postin-
jection) for Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores (p<0.001),
Mayo Elbow Performance Index (MEPI) (p<0.001) and ultra-
sound evaluation (p<0.001 for longitudinal and transverse
axes) (table 3).
Patellar tendinopathy
One study41 reported the use of bone marrow-derived stem
cells in eight cases of patellar tendinopathy. There were statistic-
ally significant improvements after an average 5-year (range 3–6)

ities in daily living (63–90, p=0.0086) and sports (24–63,

for Lysholm score (33–53, p=0.1043), KOOS pain (47–63,
p=0.2399), KOOS quality of life (50–71, p=0.0825) and SF-12
mental and physical domains (p=0.5589 and p=0.438, respect-
ively). On ultrasound evaluation, trends towards improvement
were seen but these were not statistically evaluated.
Rotator cuff repair
Bone marrow-derived stem cells were injected at the tendon–
bone junction of arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs in two
studies.34 35 Combined, these two studies34 35 evaluated the
results of 59 patients with stem cell injections. Both studies
reported a reduced number of reruptures over time (table 3)
compared either with historically selected controls35 (6 vs 25 in
favour of stem cell injection, p<0.005) or compared with the
literature.34
One
study34
reported
improvement

mean

scores (12 SD 3.0 preoperative vs 31 SD 3.2, 12 months post-
operative), but no statistical analysis was performed. The latter
study35 did not report any functional or other outcomes besides
reruptures. Stem cell-treated patients with and without rerup-
tures were compared and a dose–response analysis found signifi-
cantly less bone marrow mononuclear cells per cubic centimetre
(1500+1200 vs 4200+1900, p<0.01) and less progenitor cells
(14 000+9000 vs 54 000+23 000, p<0.01) in the grafts of
patients with a rerupture.
Adverse events
Adverse events were reported in one trial.36 No serious adverse
events were reported. Mild swelling was seen in 50% of the par-
ticipants within 48 hours postinjection which spontaneously
subsided within 2 weeks. T
wo participants had ultrasonic evi-
dence of joint effusion after 2 weeks. One case of delayed joint
pain (7 weeks postinjection) was reported, which subsided with

Summary
Four trials at high risk of bias (level 4 of evidence) were identi-
fied during this review. One case series36 evaluated adipose-
derived stem cells in lateral epicondylar tendinopathy and found
improvements in VAS, MEPI and ultrasound evaluations, when
compared with baseline. One case series41 was available evaluat-
ing bone marrow-derived stem cells in patellar tendinopathy. It
found improved T

pared with baseline but failed to find improvements in Lysholm,

 SF-12 and other KOOS subdomains. One case series34 and one
non-RCT35 were found evaluating bone marrow-derived stem
cells in rotator cuff repair surgery. Historical controls were used
in one trial35 and reported a reduced retear rate. The other
trial34 reported lower retear rates compared with the literature
and improved UCLA scores compared with baseline. One trial36
reported adverse events. None of these adverse events were of
grave nature.
DISCUSSION
W
e performed a systematic review to evaluate the body of evi-
dence for the use of stem cells in tendon disorders. A total of
four trials were found,34–36
41 only one35 of which used a
control group. Three unpublished trials43–45 were identified,
two43 45 of which have been finalised. The use of stem cells was
tested in patellar tendinopathy, lateral epicondylar tendinopathy
and rotator cuff tears. Bone marrow-derived and allogenic
adipose-derived stem cells were used. All trials were rated as
level 4 evidence, making only level 4 evidence available for the
efficacy of stem cell use in tendon disorders.
In lateral epicondylar tendinopathy, patellar tendinopathy and
rotator cuff repairs improved healing evaluated through imaging
modalities such as MRI or ultrasound, functional outcomes and
pain scores were found compared with baseline. Reruptures
of repaired rotator cuffs treated with stem cell injections per-
operatively, were reduced when compared with the literature or
historically selected controls. Safety was poorly reported as only
one trial36 reported adverse events but found them to be gener-
ally of mild nature such as transient pain, swelling or effusion.
Risk of bias in the identified trials
All trials were at high risk of bias and had major methodological
limitations. First, only one trial included a control group35
though it should be noted that this was a historically controlled
study, consequently, no randomisation could be performed.
Neither patients, personnel or outcome assessors were blinded
to group allocation. This allowed for a high risk of selection,
performance and detection bias. All other trials34 36 41 lacked a
control group, allowing for alternative explanations of their
positive results (eg, natural course, confounding, placebo).
Lateral epicondylar tendinopathy, for example, is a benign con-
dition, usually resolving within 12–18 months.9 46 It is possible
that the ultrasound findings in the trial by Lee et al36 are a
result of natural healing. Ellera Gomez et al34 compared the low
retear rates with the literature, however, rerupture rates vary
greatly between studies.47 48 Given the small number of patients
in this study, and a 0% rerupture rate within 12 months, this
may still lie within the normal distribution of probability.
The placebo effect might account for the positive results of
Pascual-Garrido et al.41 The inclusion of non-adult participants
(ie, <18 years) in this trial41 may also limit the generalisability
of the study’s findings to the adult population. W
e question the
ethical soundness of highly experimental stem cell therapy in
minors. Also, a high risk of selection and attrition bias seems to
be present in this study; only patients who were able to com-
plete the 2-year follow-up were included in the report.
Overall, due to high risk of bias across studies, all trials were
assessed as level 4 evidence. Therefore, these results should be
interpreted with great caution.
Stem cells have been used in medicine in attempts to treat a
variety of conditions.49–54 Their use in tendinopathy is relatively
new and this review critically examined the body of evidence in
humans. It is now clear that the evidence to date is very poor
with only highly biased trials reporting on the efficacy of stem
cell treatment. Previous reviews14–16 which included veterinary
studies, have reported more trends towards efficacy but, as is the
case with this review, all concluded that there is almost no evi-
dence for stem cell therapy in the treatment of tendon disorders
in humans. Three ongoing trials43–45 were found and we hope
to review their results once they are published. Despite the fact
that these trials may influence our results, we felt it was neces-
sary to publish this result now considering the growing interest
in this subject and the growing number of stem cell clinics.29
Theoretical rationale for the use of stem cells to treat
tendon disorders
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are defined as self-renewing
and multipotent cells capable of differentiating into multiple
cell types, including osteocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes, hepa-
tocytes, myocytes and cardiomyocytes.55 MSCs were originally
isolated from the bone marrow stroma but have also been iden-
tified also in other tissues, such as fat, epidermis and umbilical
cord blood.56 57 The International Society for Cellular Therapy
released a position statement in 200658 outlining the minimal
criteria for defining MSCs: adherence to plastic, the presence of
CD73, CD90 and CD105 antigen markers, absence of CD11b,
CD14, CD19, CD34, CD45, CD79α and HLA class II and the
ability to differentiate in vitro.
The mechanisms by which stem cells are proposed to repair
injured tendons can be considered twofold. First, stem cells are
proposed to differentiate into tenocytes and restart the healing
process by differentiating into tenocytes.18 59 60 However, the
fate of stem cells after injection is not well studied in tendon
injury and research suggests that few cells remain in situ after
implantation.14–16 25 61 Therefore, it is questionable whether
there are enough cells to be of value for tendon repair. Second,
the paracrine effect of stem cells is hypothesised to be beneficial
for tissue repair.14 62 63 Several reviews25 63–67 have summarised
the number of growth factors and cytokines that are secreted by
MSCs and how these factors influence, often in animal models,
the repair mechanisms of injured tendons. It should be noted
that other injection therapies with growth factors, such as
platelet-rich plasma, have mostly failed to demonstrate their
efficacy within tendon disorder treatment.11 12 68
Safety and quality of stem cell preparations
The MSCs used in the reviewed trials have not been found to
be associated with malignancy.69 70 However, safety concerns
remain an important issue for clinicians.62 Of the included
trials, only one36 reported adverse events, finding only mild
adverse events within a 1-year follow-up. The remaining
trials34 35 41 failed to report adverse events allowing for poten-
tially dangerous side effects to have gone unnoticed.
Although all trials34–36 41 documented the mean number of
injected stem cells, the ways of analysing the numbers and cell
types varied across the studies. As mentioned earlier, specific cri-
teria are available.58 Of the included studies, only one trial36
partially fulfilled these criteria. Ellera Gomes et al34 used CD34
and mononuclear cell analysis, which is more specific for haem-
atopoietic progenitor cells rather than bone marrow MSCs.55 58
The use of colony-forming unit counting by Hernigou et al35 is
a method that seems incomplete without surface marker ana-
lysis.71
Considering
the
above,
the
methods
used
by
Pascual-Garrido et al41 also seem inadequate to properly
confirm adequate stem cell numbers.
In three studies,34 35 41 stem cells concentrates were used and
culturing was never performed. The mean number of injected
cells varied widely with up to a factor of 1000 in difference

 generally favouring culturing. T
wo studies35 36 analysed whether
dosage played a role in the healing process. Lee et al36 found no
differences between 106 or 107 cells, Hernigou et al35 found
significantly lower number of stem cells and progenitor cells in
patients with graft failures. The other two studies34 41 did not
perform dosage analyses.
One concern with uncultured stem cell concentrates as used
in the identified trials34 35 41 is the presence of multiple cell
types.62 As to date there is no consensus62 72 regarding whether
this non-cultured concentrating method is equally effective as
the use of cultured stem cell implantation or injection, we
cannot judge whether this is an important factor influencing the
outcomes. Furthermore, we could not evaluate whether cell
dose may play a role in possible therapeutic efficacy due to the
heterogeneity in cell numbers, types of tendon disorders and
the low number of participants.
Limitations
W
e excluded two trials37 39 that used bone marrow aspirates,
and we discovered two other trials73 74 that made attempts to
investigate stem cell efficacy in tendon disorders. All these trials
were excluded because no analysis was performed to confirm
the presence of potential stem cells in the intervention. W
e
therefore believe their exclusion is justified, as inclusion would
have
created
even
more
heterogeneity
in
this
review.
Furthermore, publication bias could not be investigated due to
the small number of trials. This might mean that overly positive
results are presented in our review. However, we aimed to
control for publication bias as much as possible. W
e searched
several grey literature databases and multiple trial registers to
find all relevant existing studies investigating stem cell therapy
in tendon disorders. Even though no protocol for this review
was registered, we wrote and followed an a priori protocol
which is freely available through the corresponding author
(HP). Despite these limitations, we believe that this review pro-
vides the clinician with a good overview of the current evidence
for using stem cells to treat of tendon disorders.
Future directions
As illustrated by this review, we are currently still a long way
from being able to endorse, based on high-quality evidence, the
addition of stem cells to the arsenal of possible treatments for
tendon disorders. Many gaps in our knowledge about the effi-
cacy, safety, administration route, timing of administration,
dosage and consideration of mechanical stimulation13 60 75 are
evident when reviewing the available literature. Future research
has many questions to answer but more importantly, we believe
that sound scientific investigations should be performed. As we
illustrated with our risk of bias assessment, the current evidence
is tainted with methodological flaws that allow for high risks of
biased results. In the future, stem cell therapies should be tested
RCTs, with appropriate characterisation of the cells, proper ran-
domisation procedures and allocation concealment. Considering
the results of currently available treatments like eccentric exer-
cises,5 6 we believe it to be important to compare the possible
efficacy of stem cell treatments with these currently accepted
treatment modalities. Furthermore, studies should incorporate
blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors.
Adverse events should be recorded and reported in all cases.
Finally, sample sizes should be large enough to find clinically
relevant differences.
The above discussed shortcomings and concerns are in con-
gruence with the findings of the recently published position
statement of the Australasian College of Sports Physicians.62 On
the efficacy of stem cell treatment for tendinopathy they stated
that there is a lack of evidence, which is a statement we believe
to still hold true despite the availability of human trials.
Furthermore, the concerns about long-term safety and poor
research is one we share alike.
CONCLUSION
There is no evidence to support the use of stem cell therapy in
tendon disorders. Overall, only level 4 evidence was found for
the effectiveness of stem cells, and this is insufficient to recom-
mend the use of stem cells of any kind in the treatment of any
kind of tendon disorder. All studies are at high risk of bias and
results must be replicated through good practice research before
more general clinical implementation can be recommended.
What are the findings?
▸ The current level of evidence for stem cell use in tendon
disorders is extremely poor.
▸ Only case reports or poorly designed trials are available.
▸ The results from the identified trials are at high risk of bias.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
▸ The use of stem cell therapy for tendon disorders in clinical
practice is not suitable outside of an appropriate ethics
approved clinical trial.
▸ Patients seeking stem cell treatment for their tendon
disorders can now be made aware of the lack of evidence
and potential dangers.
▸ In cases where stem cells are used, safety must be
monitored and reported by the investigator.
