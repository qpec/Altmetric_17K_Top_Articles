Interactions between brain and spinal
cord mediate value effects in
nocebo hyperalgesia
A. Tinnermann,1* S. Geuter,1,2 C. Sprenger,1,3 J. Finsterbusch,1 C. Büchel1
Value information about a drug, such as the price tag, can strongly affect its therapeutic
effect. We discovered that value information influences adverse treatment outcomes
in humans even in the absence of an active substance. Labeling an inert treatment
as expensive medication led to stronger nocebo hyperalgesia than labeling it as
cheap medication. This effect was mediated by neural interactions between cortex,
brainstem, and spinal cord. In particular, activity in the prefrontal cortex mediated
the effect of value on nocebo hyperalgesia. Value furthermore modulated coupling
between prefrontal areas, brainstem, and spinal cord, which might represent a flexible
mechanism through which higher-cognitive representations, such as value, can modulate
early pain processing.
P
atients in randomized placebo controlled
clinical trials frequently discontinue their
participation because of side effects. Yet,
after unblinding, it turns out that some of
these patients were part of the placebo
group and thus never received any active medi-
cation (1). This is a case of the adverse nocebo
effect (2, 3) that can be seen in contrast to the
placebo effect. The placebo effect with respect to
pain involves an opioidergic mechanism (4–7)
and recruits the descending pain modulatory
system (5), which targets the spinal cord dorsal
horn (8). Placebo effects can be manipulated by
providing value information (e.g., price) about a
treatment (9–11). Although higher-priced treat-
ments lead to higher placebo effects (11), they
might also lead to an increase in perceived side
effects. We thus investigated whether value in-
formation about a medical treatment can fur-
ther modulate behavioral nocebo effects and the
underlying neural network dynamics.
How can a medial prefrontal value signal
(10, 12) interfere with central pain processing
and modulate expectation-induced pain per-
ception? One possibility is that this modulation
is mediated through functional interactions
between key structures of the descending pain
pathway (fig. S8) (13). Because nocebo hyper-
algesia also modulates activity at the spinal
level (14), we followed this lead and investigated
whether nocebo hyperalgesia is mediated through
interactions within a cortico-subcortico-spinal
network (15), in analogy to other forms of cog-
nitive pain modulation (16, 17). However, simul-
taneous functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) measurements of neural activity in the
brain and spinal cord are technically challeng-
ing (18). To investigate the dynamics from cortex
to spinal cord, we developed an fMRI method
(19, 20) that allows the measurement of neural
activity in the entire central pain system, com-
prising the cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord
(figs. S2 and S3).
To study the influence of value on nocebo
hyperalgesia, we induced negative treatment
expectations and experiences in two groups of
participants (21). As the nocebo treatment, we
introduced two alleged medical creams that did
not contain any active ingredient and provided
different value information by labeling one cream
as cheap and the second one as expensive. To
support the cheap versus expensive impression,
we designed two paper medical-cream boxes that

 contained design elements for expensive (blue
box) and cheap (orange box) medication, respec-
tively (Fig. 1A). A sample of 66 participants that
did not take part in the nocebo and value-
manipulation experiment estimated actual phar-
macy prices of the creams on the basis of the
appearance of the boxes. The price of the blue
box was estimated to be significantly higher than
the price of the orange box (Fig. 1B; for statistical
results, see figure captions). Consequently, we
used the two boxes in the main experiment to
reinforce our value manipulation.
For the main experiment, an independent
sample of 49 healthy participants was randomly
assigned to either the cheap or the expensive
treatment group (table S1). The treatment was
introduced as a cream clinically used to treat
atopic dermatitis. We induced a nocebo expec-
tation in both groups [(21) and table S2]. To
implement the value manipulation, we provided
different price information about the tested
creams. The “cheap group” was told to test a
cheap cream and received the nocebo cream
from the orange box, whereas the “expensive
group” was told to test an expensive cream and
received the nocebo cream from the blue box.
To compare nocebo responses to baseline pain,
an additional control cream was introduced in
both groups. In reality, all creams were iden-
tical and did not contain any active ingredi-
ent. After the nocebo and value expectation
induction, participants underwent a heat-pain
paradigm on skin patches on the left forearm
that were pretreated with either nocebo or con-
trol cream (Fig. 1A). During an experience induc-
tion phase, temperatures were covertly increased
for nocebo and decreased for control condi-
tions to let participants experience the sup-
posed pain-augmenting effect of the treatment.
During the test phase, temperatures in nocebo
and control conditions were identical while
blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) responses
were recorded.
First, we were interested to see if pain ratings
in the nocebo condition differed between cheap
and expensive nocebo treatment. The behavioral
nocebo effect was significantly greater in the ex-
pensive group than in the cheap group (Fig. 1C
and fig. S1). Notably, pain ratings did not differ
between groups during the experience induc-
tion phase, indicating that this significant dif-
ference in nocebo effects is unrelated to the
experience induction (fig. S1). Expensive treat-
ment thus enhances behavioral expectation effects
irrespective of the directionality of the expecta-
tion. In analogy to placebo effects (10, 11), the
most likely explanation is that participants infer
that expensive medication contains a more potent
and effective agent and, consequently, produces
more side effects.
Furthermore, we analyzed the time course of
pain ratings using single-subject linear regres-
sion models. Slopes revealed that the nocebo
effect increased significantly over time in the ex-
pensive group compared to the cheap group (Fig.
1D). This temporal strengthening of the nocebo
effect was not influenced by the control con-
dition (fig. S1).
In a first fMRI analysis, we identified a large
number of pain-sensitive areas along the central
nervous system that were activated during pain-
ful stimulation, irrespective of expectation and
value (fig. S2). The location of the peak voxel in
the spinal cord was within a 1-mm radius of a
pain cluster reported in a previous combined
imaging study (20).
Next, we identified regions that displayed neu-
ral representations of nocebo effects irrespective
of value. This pooled nocebo effect was repre-
sented in the spinal cord at the height of spinal
segment C6 (Fig. 2A and fig. S4), slightly more
caudal and medial than the pain cluster. Compar-
ing this cluster with results from a previous study
that observed nocebo activation within the spi-
nal cord in an independent sample of subjects
indicated that both clusters were located at
almost identical locations within the spinal cord
(fig. S5) (14).
Because the behavioral nocebo effect was
stronger in the expensive group, we investigated
how value-related nocebo effects are reflected at
the neural level. The periaqueductal gray (PAG)
showed greater activation differences between
nocebo and control conditions in the expensive
group compared to the cheap group (Fig. 2B).
Similar results were observed in prefrontal areas

 and the right extended amygdala (fig. S5).
Nocebo effects have been conceptualized as the
opposite of placebo-related effects (22). However,
we observed similar activations for nocebo as
compared to placebo (4, 10, 23), indicating that
the PAG is engaged during cognitive modulation
of pain processing irrespective of the direction of
expectation, possibly through activation of on-or-
off cells, which either inhibit or facilitate noci-
ceptive transmission in the spinal cord (24).
We further examined whether the degree of
individual nocebo effects is correlated with BOLD
signal changes along the descending pain path-
way. Neural activation in the rostral anterior cin-
gulate cortex (rACC) was negatively correlated
with behavioral nocebo effects across partici-
pants, irrespective of treatment group (Fig. 2C
and fig. S6). Thus, the level of rACC deactivation
predicted the strength of reported pain increase
during nocebo treatment, which suggests that
in hypoalgesic or nonpainful conditions, activa-
tion in the rACC might subserve an inhibitory
function on the descending pain system, and
that with increasing levels of deactivation, a de-
scending disinhibition leads to increasing activ-
ity at the level of the PAG. Furthermore, this
result complements findings in placebo hypo-
algesia where the rACC mediates placebo ef-
fects (5, 6). The rACC shows a graded response
pattern in which increasing activity is related
to increased pain reduction (10, 25). More-
over, a pain expectancy signal in the rACC de-
creases with increasing probabilities for pain,
indicating that the rACC shows less activa-
tion if more pain is expected (26). The negative
correlation of rACC activation with individ-
ual behavioral nocebo effects further indicates
that—with respect to the rACC—placebo and
nocebo effects represent a continuum and not
opposing entities.
Next, we addressed the hypothesis that the
rACC is directly mediating the effect of value.
We performed a bootstrapped mediation analy-
sis and tested if the activation strength in the
rACC mediates the relationship between cheap
and expensive nocebo treatment and behavioral
nocebo effects (Fig. 3). This analysis revealed that
the effect of our price intervention on the strength
of behavioral nocebo effects was mediated by
activation in the rACC, indicating that, in addition
to economic value (12), treatment expectation
value is encoded in prefrontal cortex.
To test if value further modulates neural
coupling along the descending pain pathway
(Fig. 4A) (5, 20), we extracted the fMRI-signal
time course from the activation in the spinal
cord and rACC (seed regions) and calculated
individual coupling strengths between each
of these seed regions and other brain regions.
Both seed regions revealed coupling with the PAG
that correlated significantly with the behavioral
nocebo effect (Fig. 4B and fig. S7). However,
the correlation pattern differed between treat-
ment group and PAG cluster. The PAG cluster
interacting with the rACC was located ventrally,
whereas the PAG cluster showing coupling with
the spinal cord was located laterally (Fig. 4, B

 and C). Overlaying these two PAG clusters
onto the previously reported PAG activity
revealed that the latter PAG cluster over-
lapped with both coupling-related PAG subre-
gions (fig. S7). This functional segregation of
the PAG is in line with studies showing in-
trinsic rACC coupling with the ventral PAG (27).
Conversely, neuronal tracing studies in rats
revealed that connections from the spinal cord
targeted more lateral aspects of the PAG (28).
These findings indicate that coupling along the
descending pain pathway is a key mechanism
to convey value information to early pain-
processing areas. Furthermore, distinct subre-
gions within the PAG interact with different
pain-processing areas, which might represent a
flexible mechanism to modulate pain percep-
tion along different levels of the descending
pain system.
In summary, we show that expensive medi-
cation increases the risk for developing nocebo-
related side effects. Moreover, our fMRI protocol
allows us to assess how value information about
a medical treatment modulates the entire cen-
tral human pain system. Two regions of the de-
scending pain pathway, namely the rACC and
the PAG, facilitated expectation-induced pain
modulation and conveyed the difference in
nocebo effects between cheap and expensive
treatment. Furthermore, modulation of cou-
pling within the rACC-PAG-spinal axis might
represent a flexible mechanism through which
higher-cognitive representations such as value
interact with the descending pain pathway to
modulate pain processing between early sub-
cortical areas and nociceptive processing at the
spinal level. We did not observe increased ac-
tivity in other cortical pain-sensitive areas un-
der nocebo, which is in line with another study
(29) that instead observed increased nocebo
activations in subcortical and limbic regions
such as the thalamus, amygdala, and hippo-
campus. This could indicate that expectation
modulation might predominantly involve the
spinoreticular tract, which comprises regions
that showed increased activity in the expensive
nocebo group, such as the brainstem, amygdala,
and prefrontal cortex (30).
