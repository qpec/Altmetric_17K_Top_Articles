Abstract
Wood ants fight pathogens by incorporating tree resin with antimicrobial properties 
into their nests. They also produce large quantities of formic acid in their venom 
gland, which they readily spray to defend or disinfect their nest. Mixing chemicals to 
produce powerful antibiotics is common practice in human medicine, yet evidence 
for the use of such “defensive cocktails” by animals remains scant. Here, we test the 
hypothesis that wood ants enhance the antifungal activity of tree resin by treating 
it with formic acid. In a series of experiments, we document that (i) tree resin had 
much higher inhibitory activity against the common entomopathogenic fungus 
Metarhizium brunneum after having been in contact with ants, while no such effect 
was detected for other nest materials; (ii) wood ants applied significant amounts of 
endogenous formic and succinic acid on resin and other nest materials; and (iii) the 
application of synthetic formic acid greatly increased the antifungal activity of resin, 
but had no such effect when applied to inert glass material. Together, these results 
demonstrate that wood ants obtain an effective protection against a detrimental 
microorganism by mixing endogenous and plant- 
acquired chemical defenses. In con-
clusion, the ability to synergistically combine antimicrobial substances of diverse 
origins is not restricted to humans and may play an important role in insect 
societies.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Animals living in large social groups are exposed to a high risk of 
 
epidemics. In response to this threat, social animals have evolved 
 
sophisticated individual and collective means to control disease, 
which combine immunological, behavioral, and organizational defenses 
(Cremer, Armitage, & Schmid- 
Hempel, 2007; Naug & Smith, 2007; 
Wilson- 
Rich, Spivak, Fefferman, & Starks, 2009). Collective defenses 
include ways to keep the environment hygienic, for example, by 
removing or neutralizing infectious particles (Morelos- 
Juárez, 
Walker, Lopes, & Hughes, 2010; Tragust et al., 2013).

An original way to fight enemies is to exploit the defensive chemi-
cals produced by other organisms (de Roode, Lefèvre, & Hunter, 2013). 
Humans use a myriad of chemicals from multiple sources, alone or 
in synergistic combinations, to medicate themselves, clean their en-
vironment, or control pests (Mason & Singer, 2015). Animals also har-
ness chemicals produced by other species for their own defense (de 
Roode et al., 2013; Mason & Singer, 2015). For example, many insect 
herbivores sequester plant secondary metabolites to gain protection 
against predators or parasites (Lefèvre, Oliver, Hunter, & de Roode, 
2010; Nishida, 2002). It has been proposed that animals may combine 
multiple acquired chemicals to benefit from synergistic effects (Mason 
& Singer, 2015). However, evidence for the use of such “defensive 
cocktails” by animals remains scant (Mason & Singer, 2015).
Wood ants and honeybees incorporate tree resin with antimicro-
bial properties into their nest (Christe, Oppliger, Bancala, Castella, 
& Chapuisat, 2003; Simone- 
Finstrom & Spivak, 2010). In the wood 
ant Formica paralugubris, workers actively collect large amounts of 
resin from coniferous trees, which they bring back to their nest and 
place near their brood (Brütsch & Chapuisat, 2014; Castella, Christe, 
& Chapuisat, 2008). Coniferous resin is rich in secondary metabolites 
with antimicrobial properties (Phillips & Croteau, 1999). The presence 
of resin decreases the overall microbial load in wood ant nests and 
protects the ants against bacterial and fungal pathogens (Chapuisat, 
Oppliger, Magliano, & Christe, 2007; Christe et al., 2003).
Wood ants are also chemical factories. They produce large quanti-
ties of formic acid in their venom gland, which they spray at prey and 
enemies (Blum, 1992; Morgan, 2008). In other ant species, formic acid 
is also present in the trophallactic fluid following oral uptake from the 
venom gland (Tragust et al., 2013), and other acids have been found 
in the metapleural glands (Vieira, Morgan, Drijfhout, & Camargo- 
Mathias, 2012). Formic acid has well- 
known antimicrobial properties. 
It is widely used by humans, as cleaning agent and as preservative ad-
ditive in livestock food (Iba & Berchieri, 2007). Moreover, formic acid 
is effective against Metarhizium, a common fungal pathogen of ants 
(Graystock & Hughes, 2011), and is used by Lasius neglectus ants to 
disinfect their brood (Tragust et al., 2013). This suggests that wood 
ants may combine endogenous acids with tree resin.
Here, we test the hypothesis that wood ants apply self- 
produced 
acids on tree- 
collected resin to produce a more potent antimicrobial 
agent. Specifically, we examined whether (i) ants enhance the antifun-
gal activity of resin, (ii) ants add endogenous acids to resin, and (iii) 
these acids increase the antifungal activity of resin.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Effect of wood ants on the antifungal activity of 
resin
In a first experiment, we tested whether spruce tree resin that had 
been in contact with wood ants had increased inhibitory activity 
against the generalist entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brun-
neum, compared to resin that had not been contacted by ants. As con-
trols, we used twigs and small stones. Twigs are major constituents of 
wood ant nests, and small stones are commonly found in some of the 
nests (Castella et al., 2008).
We established experimental groups of workers from field colonies 
of Formica paralugubris (Chapuisat, Goudet, & Keller, 1997; Christe 
et al., 2003). We collected pieces of fresh resin from spruce trees, as 
well as twigs and stones of similar size, in areas away from ant col-
onies. The pieces of resin, twigs, and stones were disinfected under 
UV light (30 mn under a UV lamp radiating at 254 nm in a Biosafety 
Cabinet BSC—700II, HMC Europe).
Each tested material (pieces of resin, twigs, and stones) was kept 
with and without ant workers for 2 weeks. In ant- 
exposed treatments, 
four pieces of the tested material were kept with 40 workers in a small 
plastic box (13.5 × 15 × 5 cm; n = 25 replicates for each material). In 
ant- 
free controls, four pieces of the tested material were kept in a box 
without workers (n = 25 replicates for each material). The edges of the 
boxes were treated with Fluon to prevent ant escape. The workers 
were free to interact with the pieces of resin, twigs, and stones. They 
had ad libitum access to water and jelly food consisting of chicken 
eggs, honey, water, and agar (Reber & Chapuisat, 2012a).
After this 2- 
week period of exposure to ants or ant- 
free control 
conditions, we measured the inhibitory activity of resin, twigs, and 
stones against the fungus M. brunneum. We used a strain that had 
been isolated from Valais, Switzerland, and showed high virulence 
against Formica selysi (Reber & Chapuisat, 2012b). M. brunneum was 
described in 2009 and was previously known as M. anisopliae aniso-
pliae (Bischoff, Rehner, & Humber, 2009). A strain of the latter spe-
cies complex caused high mortality to F. paralugubris (Chapuisat et al., 
2007). M. brunneum is used here as a model fungal pathogen, while 
other pathogens might be important in the field. Indeed, the resin af-
fects a broad spectrum of fungi and bacteria that are potential patho-
gens of F. paralugubris (Chapuisat et al., 2007; Christe et al., 2003).
Inhibitory activity was measured on Malt extract agar nutritive me-
dium in 8.5- 
cm- 
diameter petri dishes, inoculated by plating 100 μl of 
0.05% Tween 20 solution containing 7 × 105 asexual spores (=conidia) 
of M. brunneum. The four pieces of each material (resin, twigs, or stone) 
coming from the same experimental box were placed together in a petri 
dish. The petri dishes (n = 25 per material and treatment) were incubated 
at 25°C for 6 days. We then photographed each petri dish and measured 
the spore- 
free areas around the tested material with the ImageJ soft-
ware (Schneider, Rasband, & Eliceiri, 2012). Spore- 
free areas either were 
void of both spores and mycelium or consisted of white and mostly ster-
ile mycelium known as sectors (Ryan, Bridge, Smith, & Jeffries, 2002).
For the statistical analysis, we used one estimate of inhibitory ac-
tivity per experimental box (=replicate). We therefore measured the 
overall spore- 
free area in each petri dish and divided it by four. This is a 
conservative estimate of the average inhibition halo around each item, 
because large halos were overlapping. We constructed a model with 
the spore- 
free area as response variable, and the material (resin, twigs 
or stone) and previous contact with workers (presence or absence of 
workers in the box) as explanatory variables. The response variable 
was square- 
root- 
transformed to achieve homogeneity of variances 
and normal distribution of residuals, as required for an ANOVA. We 
carried out post hoc comparisons with Tukey’s HSD tests.

2.2 | Transfer of endogenous acids to resin and other 
types of nest material
In a second experiment, we examined whether ants applied endog-
enous acids to pieces of resin, twigs, or stones. We placed four pieces 
of the tested material (resin, twigs, or stone) in boxes with and without 
ants as described above, except that there were 50 workers per box in 
the treatment with ants (n = 10 replicates for each material and treat-
ment type, with or without ants). As organic acids are very soluble in 
water, we sampled the acids from each material (resin, twigs, or stone) 
by immersing the four items from the same experimental box in 1 ml 
of MilliQ water for 30 s. The samples were stored at −20°C until HPLC 
analysis (see below).
We also tested whether the retention and subsequent detection 
of formic acid varied with the type of material (resin, twigs, and stone). 
For this, 1 μl of 60% synthetic formic acid (CAS number 64- 
18- 
6) was 
deposited on each type of material (10 replicates per material and 
treatment). After 24 hr, each item was immersed in 500 μl of MilliQ 
water for 30 s. The samples were stored at −20°C until HPLC analysis.
To identify the origin of the acids detected on nest materials, we 
extracted the content of the venom gland, trophallaxis fluid, and meta-
pleural glands from ten workers anesthetized with CO2. For venom 
and trophallaxis fluid, we gently pressed their gaster and collected the 
liquid with a microcapillary. For the metapleural glands, we introduced 
the tip of a microcapillary in the gland opening and extracted the liquid 
by capillarity. We diluted these extracts in 500 μl of MilliQ water. The 
samples were stored at −20°C until HPLC analysis.
To measure the organic acids in the samples, we analyzed them 
by high- 
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), using an Agilent 
HP1100 HPLC system equipped with a diode array detector (DAD), with 
UV detection wavelength set at 210 ± 2 nm. To remove small particles, 
the samples were centrifuged (3 min at 182 g) and the supernatant 
was transferred to 2- 
ml glass vials (Interchim, Swiss Labs, Mulhouse, 
F). We injected 40 μl of the samples onto a 300 mm × 7.8 mm BP- 
100 
H carbohydrate column (Benson Polymeric, USA). The temperature 
of the column was maintained at 40°C, and MilliQ water was used 
as a solvent with 20 mmol/L of sulfuric acid (analysis grade 95–97%, 
Honeywell, Germany) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Succinic (CAS num-
ber 150- 
90- 
3, Acros organics, USA) and formic (CAS number 141- 
53- 
7, Sigma Aldrich, USA) acids were quantified in the samples by external 
calibration. The linearity of the method was established using six stan-
dard solutions at concentration levels from 5 μg/mL to 1.3 mg/mL.
We constructed a model with acid quantity as response variable 
and the material (resin, twigs, or stone) and previous contact with 
workers (presence or absence of workers in the box) as explanatory 
variables. We analyzed the data of each acid separately.
2.3 | Effects of acids on the antifungal activity  
of resin
In a third experiment, we tested whether combinations of synthetic 
acids corresponding to the composition of ant endogenous acids en-
hanced the antifungal activity of the resin. We mixed commercially 
available acids with MilliQ water to obtain a formic acid solution (for-
mic acid 58.5%), a venom- 
like mix (formic acid 58.5%, succinic acid 
1.2%), and a trophallaxis- 
like mix (succinic acid 3.6%, formic acid 
0.06%) corresponding to the proportions of the main acids found in 
the venom and trophallactic fluid, respectively (see results). MilliQ 
water was used as control.
Pieces of spruce resin and pieces of safety glass were dipped in 
water, 58.5% formic acid, venom- 
like or trophallaxis- 
like mixes of 
synthetic acids, respectively. Safety glass was chosen as control be-
cause it is chemically inert. The amount of acid retained by pieces of 
glass and resin (after being dipped in acid) was not significantly dif-
ferent (0.011 ± 0.003 vs. 0.013 ± 0.006 g, respectively; t = −1.56, 
df = 42.83, p = .13; N = 30 pieces of each material). Inhibitory activity 
against M. brunneum was estimated by measuring the spore- 
free area 
around each item. We used the procedure described above, except 
that we plated 250 μl of solution containing 4.5 × 106 spores of M. 
brunneum on a nutritive medium of sabouraud glucose agar comple-
mented with the antibiotics dodine, cycloheximide, and chloramphen-
icol, in 13.5- 
cm- 
diameter petri dishes, which allowed for better fungal 
growth. For each material, we placed one item subjected to each of 
the three acid treatments (dipped in 58.5% formic acid, venom- 
like, 
and trophallaxis- 
like mixes of synthetic acids) and to control condi-
tions (dipped in water) on the same petri dish (n = 25 replicates per 
material).
For each material, we calculated the increase in antifungal activity 
due to exposure to acids. Specifically, we subtracted the spore- 
free 
area produced by the control from the area produced by the acid- 
exposed material in the same petri dish. We used Wilcoxon rank- 
sum 
tests to examine whether the acid- 
induced changes in antifungal ac-
tivity differed between resin and inert glass material. All statistical 
analyses were performed in R version 3.3.0 (R Core Team 2016).
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Effect of ants on the antifungal activity of resin
Pieces of resin that had been kept with wood ant workers showed a 
significantly higher inhibitory activity against M. brunneum than pieces 
of resin that had not been in contact with ants. In contrast, the pres-
ence of workers had no effect on the antifungal activity of twigs and 
stones (Figure 1; ANOVA, interaction between material and contact 
with workers: df = 2, F = 3.9, p = .022; Tukey’s HSD post hoc tests: 
resin versus resin that had been in contact with workers: p < .0001; 
twigs versus twigs that had been in contact with workers: p = .99; 
stones versus stones that had been in contact with workers: p = .99). 
Overall, resin had higher antifungal activity than twigs or stones 
(Figure 1; ANOVA: df = 2, F = 57.6, p < .0001).
3.2 | Transfer of endogenous acids to resin and other 
types of nest material
Both formic and succinic acids were found on resin, twigs, and stones 
that had been in contact with workers (Table 1). In contrast, we did 
 2252  |    
BRÜTSCH eT al.
not detect these two acids on resin that had not been in contact with 
workers. We detected some succinic acid on twigs and formic acid 
on stones that had not been in contact with workers, but in much 
smaller quantities than on similar materials that had been in contact 
with workers (Table 1). Overall, we detected significantly more acids 
on materials that had been kept with ants (ANOVA, main effect of 
contact with workers: formic acid, F = 34.8, df = 1, p < .0001; succinic 
acid, F = 28.1, df = 1, p < .0001).
For formic acid, there was a significant interaction between ma-
terial and contact with ants (Table 1; F = 33.6, df = 2, p < .0001). The 
high amount of formic acid detected on stones that had been kept 
with ants can be explained by large differences among the three mate-
rials in their ability to sequester and release formic acid. Indeed, when 
we experimentally deposited a controlled amount of 1 μl of 60% for-
mic acid on each type of material, we detected much more acid on 
stones than on resin and twigs, respectively (mean in μl ± SD: stones, 
0.41 ± 0.11; resin, 0.00044 ± 0.0014; twigs, 0.013 ± 0.0043; Kruskal–
Wallis rank- 
sum test: χ2 = 26.5, df = 2, p < .0001).
Worker ants produced large quantities of formic acid and compara-
tively small amounts of succinic acid. The venom gland extracts contained 
on average 58.5% of formic acid (detected in all 10 samples) and 1.2% of 
succinic acid (five samples). The trophallactic fluid contained 3.6% of suc-
cinic acid (nine samples) and 0.06% of formic acid (one sample). Fumaric 
acid was detected in trace quantities in the venom and trophallactic fluid. 
We did not detect any acid in the metapleural gland extracts.
3.3 | Effects of acids on the antifungal activity of  
resin
The treatment with synthetic formic acid at a concentration corre-
sponding to the one of venom increased the inhibitory activity of resin 
against M. brunneum (Figure 2). Formic acid had a significantly stronger 
impact on the antifungal activity of resin than of inert glass material, 
which is indicative of a synergistic interaction (Figure 2; Wilcoxon 
rank- 
sum test: W = 323, p < .0001). The treatment with the venom- 
like mix (formic + succinic acids) also increased the antifungal activity 
of resin, but not more than formic acid alone, at the same concentra-
tion (Figure 2). The increase in antifungal activity due to the venom- 
like mix was also stronger for resin than for glass (W = 312, p < .0001). 
The treatment with the trophallaxis- 
like mix, which contains more 
succinic acid and only traces of formic acid, slightly decreased the an-
tifungal activity of resin and had no effect on the antifungal activity of 
glass (Figure 2; W = 70, p = .0009).
4 | DISCUSSION
Wood ants are known to incorporate plant resin with antiseptic 
properties into their nests (Christe et al., 2003; Simone- 
Finstrom & 
Spivak, 2010). Here, we show that wood ants enhance the antifungal 
activity of tree- 
collected resin by supplementing it with endogenous

formic acid. Three lines of experimental evidence support this claim. 
First, tree resin showed significantly higher inhibitory activity against 
the fungal pathogen M. brunneum after having been in contact with 
wood ants. In sharp contrast, the contact with ants did not affect the 
antifungal activity of control materials commonly found in wood ant 
nests, namely twigs and small stones.
Second, the ants applied significant amounts of endogenous formic 
and succinic acid on resin and other types of nest material. The pro-
portion of formic acid and succinic acid varied with substrate, which 
likely reflects differences among substrates in their ability to take up 
and release formic acid (Al- 
Hosney, Carlos- 
Cuellar, Baltrusaitis, & 
Grassian, 2005). Large quantities of formic acid and small amounts of 
succinic acid were found in the venom of wood ants.
Third, the treatment of resin with synthetic formic acid greatly 
increased the antifungal activity of the resin, but had no such effect 
on pieces of glass. This interaction between formic acid and substrate 
reveals a synergistic effect. Indeed, the combination of formic acid and 
resin produced a higher antifungal activity than the additive effect of 
each compound. The application of formic acid on resin was sufficient 
to obtain this synergistic effect, and succinic acid did not appear to 
contribute to the antifungal activity of resin. Together, these results 
provide strong evidence that wood ants apply formic acid produced in 
their venom gland on tree resin, which results in a synergistic increase 
in the antifungal activity of resin.
Documented cases of “defensive mixology,” whereby animals ac-
tively combine antimicrobial substances of diverse sources to obtain 
a synergistic protection, are extremely rare (Mason & Singer, 2015). 
Honeybee workers manipulate tree resin with their mandibles, but 
there is no evidence that this process modifies the chemical compo-
sition of the resin (Simone- 
Finstrom & Spivak, 2010). Stingless bees 
collect resin from several plant genera. Although these resins vary in 
their antibacterial properties, mixing them had no synergistic effect 
against a fungus and various bacteria (Drescher, Wallace, Katouli, 
Massaro, & Leonhardt, 2014). Synergistic defenses may also occur in 
herbivores or nectar- 
feeding animals (Mason & Singer, 2015). For ex-
ample, a dietary treatment with a mix of thymol and nicotine tended 
to reduce the load of a protozoan parasite in bumblebees (Biller, Adler, 
Irwin, McAllister, & Palmer- 
Young, 2015).
Like humans, social insects have extraordinary capacities to exploit 
and modify their environment (Wilson, 1971), and they rely on sophis-
ticated means to keep pathogens at bay (Cremer et al., 2007). Here, 
we provide evidence that wood ants do not only collect tree resin with 
antimicrobial properties; they also supplement it with formic acid. 
Thus, wood ants combine their own chemical defenses with the ones 
of plants to produce a more potent antimicrobial agent that contrib-
utes to nest hygiene (Brütsch & Chapuisat, 2014; Castella et al., 2008; 
Christe et al., 2003) and protects the ants against detrimental microor-
ganisms (Chapuisat et al., 2007). Together, these findings demonstrate 
that the ability to synergistically combine antimicrobial substances of 
diverse origins is not restricted to humans and may play an important 
role in insect societies.
