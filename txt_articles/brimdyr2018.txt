Drug poisoning deaths have more than doubled in the United States since 2000 with fentanyl and fentanyl analogues primarily responsible for the jump in opioid
deaths. Robust data indicate a convincing correlation between the exposure of the fetus to other labor medications (morphine, pethidine hydrochloride, barbiturates,
phenobarbitone, meperidine, and secobarbital) and the later addiction of young adults to the same category of drug. We present the hypothesis that this effect is also
true of the opioid, fentanyl: there is a causal relationship between the increased popularity of fentanyl as a labor anesthetic in the United States since the 1980’s and
the current epidemic of fentanyl abuse.
Introduction/background
More than 2.5 million Americans are estimated to be addicted to
opioids in the form of either prescription drugs or heroin [1]. This is an
urgent public health matter. Although the opioid drug epidemic ori-
ginally focused on the misuse of prescription drugs, the overdose deaths
from these have leveled off and the landscape has changed. According
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United
States’ epidemic is worsening, with deaths increasing by 28% between
2015 and 2016. Heroin and non-pharmaceutical fentanyl overdoses are
driving these changes, not prescription drugs [2]; prescribing rates of
fentanyl have not increased while fentanyl fatalities in the past years
have increased by 79% [3]. A high proportion of these fentanyl deaths
are a result of illicitly-manufactured fentanyl (IMF) or other synthetic
opioid analogues of fentanyl. Recent reports have also revealed an in-
crease in adolescent drug users dying [4].
In the past, the chance of knowing the name of the overdose drug
beyond “opioid” was rare, as toxicology testing usually did not differ-
entiate between illicit or synthetic opioid deaths and “prescription”
opioids. However, when additional analysis has been done, as it has
recently in several states, fentanyl is found to be involved in more than
half (56.3%) of all overdose fatalities [5]. The CDC has recently ex-
panded and improved surveillance in 32 states in order to more accu-
rately identify and report the specific drugs involved in deaths [3]. As a
result, the January-February 2017 unintentional overdose fatalities in
Ohio that were analyzed by a toxicology laboratory showed that 90% of
all decedents tested positive for fentanyl with only 5.7% testing positive
for heroin. Of those that died from fentanyl, 32% did not test positive
for fentanyl’s major metabolite, norfentanyl, suggesting that death was
very rapid [6].
Fentanyl is 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more
potent than morphine. Although pharmaceutical fentanyl and IMF are
structurally similar, fentanyl analogues vary in potency. For example,
the analogue carfentanyl is 100 times more potent than fentanyl and its
intended use is not for humans, but large animals. Fentanyl sales are
considerably more lucrative than heroin sales. A kilogram of heroin can
be purchased for around $6000 and then sold for in the wholesale
market for around $80,000. A kilogram of fentanyl can be purchased
for less than $5000 and sold for a profit of $1.6 million [7].
Fentanyl was first synthesized in Belgium in 1960. The Janssen re-
search team was focused on finding a fat soluble analgesic that would
work faster and have fewer side effects than the then popular morphine
and meperidine. Lipid soluble fentanyl was fast acting, working in only
1–2 min after intravenous administration. Effects typical of opioids
occurred with fentanyl such as sedation, nausea, vomiting, respiratory
depression etc., but not the increase in plasma histamines with resulting
pruritus. By 1968 the drug, which was already popular among an-
esthesiologists in Europe, was approved by the FDA. At first, U.S.
availability for fentanyl was limited to distribution only in combination
with droperidol at a ration of 1:50 droperidol and later, when available
alone, the FDA limited distribution to small amounts (50 µg) due to
concerns that fentanyl was too potent and could also lead to abuse
problems [8]. Fentanyl was placed under international control in 1964
[9] and appeared on the illicit drug market beginning in the 1970’s
when it first began to be known for accidental overdoses [10].
Fentanyl became more and more popular in the United States, at
first for cardiac and then other surgeries in the late 1970’s, with a re-
ported ten fold increase in sales just in the year 1981. In the 1980’s the

 mode of delivery of the drug expanded from intravenous to spinal and
epidural routes of administration [8]. After publishing their initial
success with epidural fentanyl in labor, [11] a double blind study
testing fentanyl combined with bupivacaine administrated via epidural
for women in labor was published in 1982 in the British Journal of
Anaesthesia [12]. 73% of U.S. mothers were administered epidurals in
labor in 2016 [13]. Epidurals usually include both a local anesthetic
and an opioid. Fentanyl is the most commonly prescribed opioid in-
cluded in epidurals [14], and has been since a seminal 1995 article
[15].
Hypothesis
Exposure of the fetus to fentanyl via analgesia during labor pre-
disposes them to fentanyl as a recreational drug of choice in later life
(Table 1).
Evaluation of hypothesis/idea
The scientific rationale for this hypothesis is based on research de-
monstrating that later taste preferences are modulated by fetal exposure
to labor medications [16] and infant taste experiences of amniotic fluid,
by a process somewhat akin to ‘imprinting’ where a specific memory
becomes ‘engraved’ during the hours before birth leads to behavioral
effects in adult life. Maternal diet flavors are transmitted to the am-
niotic fluid (and thereby to the fetus, who begins swallowing around
the twelfth week of gestation) leading to preference for these flavors
after weaning [17]. Anthropologically, this allows culturally specific
flavors (and “safe” flavors) to be provided to the offspring. These
“transmitted flavor cues… cause neurologic and physiologic changes
that influence later behaviors” [18] (p. 707S). In addition, the opioid
system plays a distinctive role during “early development in the ac-
quisition of learned preferences regarding tastes” [19] (p.187) in this
sensitive period. During the last days of gestation, the fetus can readily
acquire chemosensory preferences, and the opioid system is involved in
the learning which occurs during this developmental stage [19].
The pathway of preferences can lead to negative consequences,
however, if the transmission consists of flavors that are less than op-
timal for health. For example, the alcohol exposure of the fetus can
affect later use. Prenatal alcohol exposure has been shown to be sig-
nificantly associated with alcohol problems at 14 [20] and 21 years of
age [21]. The relationship between prenatal exposure and later alcohol
problems remained even after the researchers took into account de-
mographic factors such as family history of alcohol problems and other
aspects of the family environment [22].
The last days of gestation may be the most important in increasing
the effect of a conditioned preference for ethanol by the newborn,
adolescent, or adult, according to research findings on rats. Specifically,
exposure during the “last period of gestation… induced a consistent
increase in ethanol intake during infancy and adolescence as well as an
enhanced palatability of the drug’s taste” [19] (p. 187). “The increase in
ethanol intake is a conditioned preference acquired in utero as a con-
sequence of association between the chemosensory and reinforcing
properties of the drug, mediated by the opioid system” [19] (p. 187).
In other words, in view of the unique role played by the opioid
system during this developmental period, and “bearing in mind that
ethanol reinforcing properties are mediated by this neurochemical
system and that ethanol has a low adverse potential for the fetus, it
seems plausible that ethanol intoxication may be perceived by the fetus
as a positive reinforcer” [19] (p. 188).
The link between fetal exposure and offspring behavior has been
examined with opiates as well. “In subjects who had subsequently be-
come addicts, a significant proportion of mothers had received opiates
or barbiturates, or both” during labor [23] (p. 1067). This is considered
“imprinting in the ethological sense” where “a specific memory en-
graved during a short sensitive period, of the order of hours, leading to
behavioral effects in adult life” [23] (p. 1067). The sensitive hours for
opioid imprinting in humans are “probably close to birth, as catecho-
lamine concentrations are then maximal and such hormones facilitate
imprinting during this period” [23] (p. 1069). Opioids injected into the
maternal epidural space enter the mother’s circulation, and cross the
placenta to the fetus. The ratio of cord blood fentanyl has shown to be
89% to 94% of the mother’s venous plasma [24,25].
When 200 opioid addicts who had been born in Stockholm, Sweden
were matched with their own unexposed siblings the estimated relative
risk was 4.7 (95% confidence interval 1.8–12.4, p for trend = .002) of
having a propensity to use or misuse similar drugs in adulthood to those
they had been exposed to within 10 h of their birth [23]. The labor
medications in these studies included opioids, barbiturates, or both
[23,26]. Nyberg and colleagues replicated their Swedish study in the
United States, again matching unexposed siblings to addicts regarding
the history of pain analgesia during birth and other variables. They
found three or more doses of opiates or barbiturates during labor re-
sulted in an Odds Ratio of 4.7 for becoming an abuser of barbiturates or
opiates. As with the Swedish study, other confounding factors (ob-
stetrical history and birth outcome) were accounted for including as-
phyxia, meconium, duration of labor, and parity and weight of the in-
fant. In a study researching the impact of socioeconomic factors, such as
single parenting, education and socio-economic status of the parents,
and birth conditions on later addiction, risks for opiates administered
within 10 h remained the significant factor in acquired addiction; es-
sentially identical to the previously published studies. Other factors
were not statistically significant [27].
Consequences of the hypothesis
Obstetric epidurals have been increasing worldwide. In France,
more than 83% of women had an epidural in 2016 [28], while the rate
was 17% in the UK in 2016 [29]. Currently, more than 73% of all US
mothers have epidural analgesia during labor [13] with fentanyl being
the most common opiate administered, usually in combination with
bupivacaine [14]. Acting locally in the epidural space to reduce the
pain of uterine contractions, fentanyl passes into the maternal circula-
tion and crosses the placenta to fetal circulation [16]. The fetus is also
exposed to the taste of fentanyl in the amniotic fluid. If prior research
on fetal exposure to other opioid obstetric drugs can be demonstrated to
apply to fentanyl, it is reasonable to believe that current obstetrical
practice continues to ‘imprint’ the next generation with a ‘taste’ for
fentanyl, a first step to the later possible abuse with fentanyl (as well as
heroin). Although addiction itself is not imprinted, the “propensity to
use or misuse opioids” is [23] (p. 1069). “Imprinting has been described
as an irreversible memory process, and it causes specific neor-
onatomical changes in the brain of animals. The remarkable stability of
an imprinted memory might be one of the explanations for the well-
known difficulties of treating addiction and the difficulty of avoiding
relapses.” [23] (p. 1069). The increase in heroin and fentanyl addiction
in the generations coming of age since the introduction of fentanyl-
based epidurals creates a compelling question. Establishing a causal
relationship between the obstetric use of fentanyl and later addiction,
overdose or death will require rigorous research designs that consider
the rich complexity of both birth and addiction.
The current challenge
The Council of Economic Advisors estimates that the true cost to
society of drug abuse is over $500 billion annually – around 2.8% of the
US GDP in 2015 with 15% of the total from non-fatal and 85% from
fatal overdoses [30]. Deaths from drug overdoses have doubled in just
the past 10 years in the United States. In 2015, 50,000 Americans died
from drug overdoses; 63% were from opioids [31]. These numbers are
shocking, but the true numbers for opioid deaths were more than 20%
higher after corrective procedures were put in place to improve the

56
 specificity of the type of drug [32].
Hospitalizations from opioid overdoses increased by 165% from
1997 to 2012 in the pediatric (under 18 years of age) population.
Pediatric intensive care admissions for opioid overdoses doubled from
2004 to 2015 [33]. Between 2001 and 2012, total in-patient costs in-
creased by nearly 50 million dollars per year for opioid overdose ad-
missions [34].
The National Institute on Drug Abuse, an agency of the government
of the United States has defined research informed prevention of drug
addiction principles derived from long-term research studies on the
origins of drug abuse behaviors and the common elements of effective
prevention programs that, if embraced, purport to prevent drug abuse.
The principles do not acknowledge labor medications as a potential
driver of drug abuse; or rather, they begin with infancy interventions.
Parents and others are admonished to work to prevent drug abuse; fa-
milies should “bond”; parents should monitor and supervise, and pro-
grams should “intervene as early as infancy to address risk factors for
drug abuse, such as aggressive behavior, poor social skills, and aca-
demic difficulties” [35].
Although recognizing that “family-focused interventions …can po-
sitively change specific parenting behavior that can reduce later risks of
drug abuse” [35], exposing the unborn infant to drugs such as fentanyl
is not. The website includes the statement “for each dollar invested in
prevention, a savings of up to $10 in treatment for alcohol or other
substance abuse can be seen [35] with compelling published research
linking other obstetric drugs to later preferences. We suggest that rig-
orous clinical studies be conducted to explore the postulated link/trend
toward fentanyl abuse to the increased popularity of this obstetrical
drug.
Conclusion
There is robust evidence correlating drugs used in labor to manage
maternal pain and later drug of abuse choices, but fentanyl, a medi-
cation that has increased in popularity since the early 1980’s, has not
been studied. In addition, alternative medications and other non-
pharmacologic strategies for managing the pain of labor have been
largely abandoned in favor of fentanyl epidurals, with three-quarters of
women in the United States now giving birth with epidurals in place. At
a cost of half a trillion dollars a year, it is certainly financially prudent
to conduct this research. If our hypothesis is confirmed through rig-
orous research, there are significant implications, especially for the
healthcare fields of obstetrics and addiction as well as healthcare
economy.
