 Association of Medical and Adult-Use Marijuana Laws
With Opioid Prescribing for Medicaid Enrollees
Hefei Wen, PhD; Jason M. Hockenberry, PhD
O
verprescribing of opioids for pain management is
consideredamajordrivingforcebehindtheopioidepi-
demic in the United States1,2 A concerted policy ef-
fort has been made during the past decade to regulate opioid-
prescribing practices.3 As access to prescription opioids
becomes increasingly restricted, there is growing concern that
restrictions on prescription opioids may have pushed those al-
ready addicted to opioids to seek more dangerous drugs and
sources.4
The potential unintended consequences of restricting ac-
cess to prescription opioids has shifted some policy attention
to the development and use of nonopioid alternatives.5,6 Mari-
juana is one of the potential alternative drugs that can pro-
vide relief from pain at a relatively lower risk of addiction and
virtually no risk of overdose.7-9 The therapeutic value of mari-
juana has been one of the central rationales behind the mari-
juanaliberalizationpoliciesinmanystatesthatnowallowmari-
juana use for medical and adult-use purposes.10 On the one
hand, proponents of these medical and adult-use marijuana
laws tout marijuana liberalization as a potential solution to the
excessive use of opioids.5,6,10 Some opponents, on the other
hand, view marijuana as a “gateway” or “stepping stone” to
opioids and worry that marijuana liberalization may exacer-
bate the opioid epidemic.6,11
IMPORTANCE Overprescribing of opioids is considered a major driving force behind the opioid
epidemic in the United States. Marijuana is one of the potential nonopioid alternatives that
can relieve pain at a relatively lower risk of addiction and virtually no risk of overdose.
Marijuana liberalization, including medical and adult-use marijuana laws, has made marijuana
available to more Americans.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association of state implementation of medical and adult-use
marijuana laws with opioid prescribing rates and spending among Medicaid enrollees.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study used a quasi-experimental
difference-in-differences design comparing opioid prescribing trends between states that
started to implement medical and adult-use marijuana laws between 2011 and 2016 and the
remaining states. This population-based study across the United States included all Medicaid
fee-for-service and managed care enrollees, a high-risk population for chronic pain, opioid
use disorder, and opioid overdose.
EXPOSURES State implementation of medical and adult-use marijuana laws from 2011 to
2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Opioid prescribing rate, measured as the number of opioid
prescriptions covered by Medicaid on a quarterly, per-1000-Medicaid-enrollee basis.
RESULTS State implementation of medical marijuana laws was associated with a 5.88% lower
rate of opioid prescribing (95% CI, −11.55% to approximately −0.21%). Moreover, the
implementation of adult-use marijuana laws, which all occurred in states with existing
medical marijuana laws, was associated with a 6.38% lower rate of opioid prescribing (95%
CI, −12.20% to approximately −0.56%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The potential of marijuana liberalization to reduce the use and
consequences of prescription opioids among Medicaid enrollees deserves consideration
during the policy discussions about marijuana reform and the opioid epidemic.

 Although both medical and adult-use marijuana laws, in
principle, have made marijuana available to more Ameri-
cans, the laws targeted different groups and may have differ-
ent opioid-related consequences. In medical marijuana laws,
states typically specify a list of conditions that are eligible for
medical marijuana, and most states have included in the list
generic terms such as “severe pain,
” “chronic pain,
” or “intrac-
tablepainunrelievedbystandardmedicaltreatmentandmedi-
cations.” Patients with eligible conditions are expected to ob-
tain recommendation from qualified physicians and enroll in
a patient registry. Patients are then issued identification cards
that allow them or their caregivers to possess a certain amount
of marijuana through home cultivation and licensed dispen-
saries (in some states these are called “compassionate
centers”).10 As a result, medical marijuana laws may have af-
fected pain management for only a selected group of patients
with pain and with state-specified eligible conditions, sources
of care from licensed marijuana physicians, and ready access
to marijuana.
Adult-use marijuana laws, which to date have been en-
acted only in states with existing medical marijuana systems,
fundamentally restructured the distribution and possession
of marijuana. Unlike the eligibility criteria and registry and/or
renewalprocessundermedicalmarijuanalaws,adult-usemari-
juana laws permit all adults 21 years or older to use mari-
juana. Furthermore, marijuana supply channels have often
been expanded through grow operations and retail dispensa-
ries licensed and taxed by the states.10 Thus, adult-use mari-
juana laws enable individuals without eligibility or access to
medical marijuana before such laws to use marijuana as self-
medication for pain conditions. A potential repercussion of
adult-use marijuana laws, however, is that the outright legal-
ization/taxation message conveyed by the laws may encour-
age individuals to normalize the risky behaviors in general.12
Empirical studies on medical marijuana laws have indi-
cated downstream policy effects on reducing opioid-related
hospitalizations, opioid overdose deaths, and opioid-
involved traffic fatalities.5,13,14 Furthermore, Bradford and
Bradford15,16 found evidence that the implementation of medi-
cal marijuana laws reduced the number of prescriptions used
to treat the conditions, including pain, which most states have
deemed eligible for medical marijuana. However, the authors
did not single out prescription opioids. The prescription opi-
oids were aggregated with nonopioid analgesics and 9 other
classes of drugs broadly classified as pain-related prescrip-
tions (eg, antidepressants, muscle relaxants, respiratory in-
halant products, functional bowel disorder agents).
Regarding adult-use marijuana laws, only 1 study to date
has examined the policy effect on opioid-related health out-
comes. Livingston and colleagues17 found an interrupted re-
versal of the upward trend in Colorado’
s opioid overdose mor-
tality when the state legalized adult-use marijuana use. No
study to date has focused on the effect of medical and adult-
use marijuana laws on opioid prescribing in particular.
We examined the opioid prescribing rates among Medic-
aid enrollees in the context of state marijuana liberalization
policies between 2011 and 2016. During this period, an esti-
mated one-third of opioid prescriptions were misused or
abused, of which Medicaid shared a disproportionately large
burden.18 In addition to opioid prescribing rates, we also stud-
ied Medicaid spending on prescription opioids, as well as the
prescribing rates of, and spending on, nonopioid pain medi-
cations. As medical and adult-use marijuana laws continue to
gather momentum in state legislatures, the study findings are
informative for states’implementation and iterations of mari-
juana reform as well as the nation’
s fight against the opioid epi-
demic.
Methods
Data
This study was exempt from institutional review board review.
The primary data source for this study was the State Drug Uti-
lization Data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Ser-
vices (CMS).19 All states are required to report to CMS quarterly
on the amount of all outpatient drug prescriptions covered by
Medicaidfee-for-serviceandmanagedcareinexchangeforfed-
eral matching funds. We excluded a few observations from the
studydataowingtotheinconsistencyinstatedatareporting.The
study sample includes 1059 state-quarter observations.
We used data from the first quarter of 2011 to the second
quarter of 2016; 2011 is the first year in which state reporting of
Medicaidmanagedcareprescriptiondatabecamemandatoryand

Key Points
Question Are medical and adult-use marijuana laws passed after
2010 associated with lower rates of opioid prescribing for
Medicaid enrollees?
Findings In this population-based, cross-sectional study using the
all-capture Medicaid prescription data for 2011 to 2016, medical
marijuana laws and adult-use marijuana laws were associated with
lower opioid prescribing rates (5.88% and 6.38% lower,
respectively).
Meaning Medical and adult-use marijuana laws have the potential
to lower opioid prescribing for Medicaid enrollees, a high-risk
population for chronic pain, opioid use disorder, and opioid
overdose, and marijuana liberalization may serve as a component
of a comprehensive package to tackle the opioid epidemic.

11-digit,3-segmentNationalDrugCode(NDC)number.Weclas-
sified opioid products into 2 categories based on the Con-
trolled Substance Act scheduling: Schedule II opioids and
Schedule III to V opioids. The Schedule II opioids are gener-
ally considered to have a higher addiction rate and overdose
liability. Since October 2014, hydrocodone combination prod-
ucts have been rescheduled from Schedule III to Schedule II.26
Accordingly, we classified all hydrocodone combination prod-
ucts as Schedule II opioids throughout the entire study pe-
riod.Weexcludedtheopioidproductsthatwereprimarilyused
for medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder and
for conditions other than pain (eg, codeine-containing cough
and cold medications). In addition to the main outcome of opi-
oid prescribing rates, we also studied Medicaid spending on
prescription opioids, as well as the prescribing rates of, and
spendingon,nonopioidpainmedications.(SeetheSupplement
for the detailed information on variable measurement.)
The key independent variables are an indicator for the
implementation of medical marijuana laws and an indicator
fortheimplementationofadult-usemarijuanalaws.Thepolicy
indicators were assigned a value of 1 for each full quarter sub-
sequent to the effective date of the medical or adult-use mari-
juana law in a state, and a value of 0 for the premedical mari-
juana or pre–adult-use marijuana law quarters and for the
comparison states. The medical marijuana law indicator cap-
tures the association between medical marijuana law imple-
mentation and opioid prescribing relative to no marijuana law.
The adult-use marijuana law indicator captures the associa-
tionbetweenadult-usemarijuanalawimplementationandopi-
oid prescribing in the context of an existing medical mari-
juana law because no states without a medical marijuana law
have adopted an adult-use marijuana law.
The 2 main policy indicators treat medical marijuana laws
and adult-use marijuana laws as 2 homogeneous sets of laws
between states and across time. Furthermore, we explored the
heterogeneous policy effects using 12 separate indicators for
8 state medical marijuana laws and 4 state adult-use mari-
juana laws. The state-specific policy effects help provide fur-
ther insights into the potential policy heterogeneity associ-
ated with differences in statutory language, enforcement
experience, and policy environments across states.27 (See the
Supplement for a summary of medical marijuana laws and
adult-use marijuana laws.)
Statistical Analyses
We used a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences de-
sign, which is analogous to an adjusted pre-post trend differ-
ence analysis. In modeling this, we used a state and quarter
fixed-effects approach that has commonly been used in mul-
tistate, multipolicy evaluations. This 2-way fixed-effects ap-
proach allows us to account for unobserved differences across
statesthatwereconstantovertime,aswellasnation-widesecu-
lartrendsthatwerecorrelatedwithprescriptionopioiduse(eg,
nationwide leveling off and gradual reduction in annual opi-
oid prescribing rate, rising public awareness of the role of opi-
oids in pain management and the role of buprenorphine in opi-
oid use disorder treatment).28
All models were population-weighted and adjusted for
state-level characteristics that varied over time and were
correlated with prescription opioid use or the Medicaid sys-
tem. Such covariates include overall physician supply,
buprenorphine-waivered physician supply, general eco-
nomic conditions, and concurrent state policies, such as
prescription drug monitoring program adoption and man-
dates, pain clinic regulations, and Medicaid expansions.
95% Confidence intervals were derived from standard errors
clustered by state to account for within-state serial correla-
tion in a difference-in-differences design. We performed 2
sets of sensitivity analyses: first, we included group-specific
linear trends at the US Census Division level to account for
the unobserved US Census Division–wide confounding fac-
tors that evolve over time at a constant rate; second, we
excluded the states with medical and adult-use marijuana
laws in place before 2011 from the comparison states. Fur-
thermore, we performed “parallel-trend assumption” tests
by statistically and graphically comparing the prepolicy
trends between medical marijuana states, adult-use mari-
juana states, and the comparison states. We also performed
falsification tests by examining the policy effects on 3
classes of drugs prescribed for conditions that were unlikely
to be affected by marijuana use or marijuana liberalization
policies. These sensitivity analyses and statistically checks
can be found in the Supplement.
Results
Figure 1 indicates that state implementation of medical and
adult-use marijuana laws was associated with a lower
Medicaid-covered opioid prescribing rate. Specifically, the
implementation of medical marijuana laws was associated
with a 5.88% lower rate of Medicaid-covered prescriptions
for all opioids (95% CI, −11.55% to approximately −0.21%).
Given that the annual rate of Medicaid-covered opioid pre-
scriptions is on average 670.16 per 1000 enrollees in states
without medical marijuana laws, the effect size of medical
marijuana laws is equivalent to 39.41 fewer opioid prescrip-
tions per 1000 enrollees per year. Moreover, when states
with existing medical marijuana laws implemented adult-
use marijuana laws, the implementation of adult-use mari-
juana laws was associated with an additional 6.38% lower
opioid prescription rate (95% CI, −12.20% to approximately
−0.56%). Using the annual average in states with medical
marijuana laws but no adult-use marijuana laws (ie, 621.82
opioid prescriptions per 1000 enrollees), the effect size of
adult-use marijuana laws can be translated to 39.67 fewer

 opioid prescriptions per 1000 enrollees per year. Further-
more, the estimated lower rate of opioid prescribing associ-
ated with adult-use marijuana laws was mainly concen-
trated in Schedule II opioids (−7.79%; 95% CI, −14.73% to
approximately −0.85%), whereas the lower prescribing rate
associated with medical marijuana laws was more pro-
nounced in Schedule III to V opioids (−10.40%; 95% CI,
−19.05% to approximately −1.74%).
The state-specific policy effects presented in Figure 2
reveal a more nuanced picture. Among the 8 states that
started to implement medical marijuana laws during the
study period, Delaware, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and
New Hampshire had significant lower opioid prescribing
rates, whereas the plausible differences in opioid prescrib-
ing rates in Illinois and New Hampshire were not precisely
estimated. Connecticut and Maryland, however, did not
have clinically meaningful or statistically discernable
changes in opioid prescribing rates associated with the
implementation of medical marijuana laws.
Regarding the adult-use marijuana states, 3 of the 4
states (ie, Alaska, Colorado, and Oregon) had significantly
lower opioid prescribing rates associated with the imple-
mentation of adult-use marijuana laws, whereas the change
in Washington was relatively moderate.
Furthermore, the implementation of adult-use mari-
juana laws was associated with a 9.78% lower Medicaid
spending on prescription opioids (95% CI, −18.29% to
approximately −1.26%), equivalent to an annual saving of
$1815 Medicaid spending per 1000 enrollees (Table). The
implementation of medical and adult-use marijuana laws
was also associated with a lower rate of Medicaid-covered
prescriptions for nonopioid pain medications of 8.36% (95%
CI, −13.67% to approximately −3.05%) and 8.69% (95% CI,
−15.50% to approximately −1.89%), respectively (Table).
Results from sensitivity analyses were consistent with
the main findings. Moreover, the “parallel-trend assump-
tion” tests and falsification tests lent weight to the validity
of the methods (Supplement).

 Discussion
This study provides some of the first empirical evidence that
the implementation of medical and adult-use marijuana laws
from 2011 to 2016 was associated with lower Medicaid-
covered opioid prescribing rates and spending. The study find-
ings are consistent with those of Bradford and Bradford,15,16
who found reductions in broad category of pain prescrip-
tions covered by Medicaid associated with medical mari-
juana laws. Our focus on opioids specifically is important in
the context of the current epidemic. Furthermore, we also
found that implementation of adult-use marijuana laws was
associated with even lower rates of opioid prescribing, which
previously had not been investigated.
Most opioid use disorder and overdose cases occurred in
patients with legitimate prescriptions from health care pro-
fessionals for pain management.29 Marijuana liberalization,
therefore,mayhavebenefitedthesepatientsbyprovidingthem
with legal protection and access to marijuana as an alterna-
tive relief from their pain conditions.7,8 According to the 2017
Yahoo News/Marist Poll,30 83% of Americans supported legal-
izing marijuana for medical purpose. The widespread public
support will bring medical marijuana laws to more and more
states for years to come, which may help decrease the use of
prescription opioids in pain management and the adverse con-
sequences, such as opioid use disorder and overdose. Further-
more, emerging evidence suggests that marijuana may help
ease opioid withdrawal symptoms.31 Thus, marijuana liberal-
ization potentially reduced prescription opioid use on 2 fronts,
serving as a substitute for opioid pain medications, and as a
complement to opioid use disorder treatment.
When exploring the policy heterogeneity across states,
we identified 2 states, Connecticut and Maryland, where the
medical marijuana laws had much less effect on opioid pre-
scribing. There are some possible explanations for these 2
notable exceptions. First, Connecticut did not list any pain
conditions as eligible conditions for medical marijuana dur-
ing the study period (included only “complex regional pain
syndrome,” a very uncommon chronic pain condition, as
one of the extended eligible conditions in late 2016). Sec-
ond, Maryland, despite the law going into effect in June
2014, did not have an operational medical marijuana system
in place until late 2016 owing to multiple legal disputes and
bureaucratic challenges.
Furthermore, the association between adult-use mari-
juana laws and lower prescription opioid rate and spending
are worth noting. Because states with adult-use marijuana
laws all had medical marijuana laws in place before the
implementation of adult-use marijuana laws, the further
reductions in opioid prescribing associated with the newly
implemented adult-use marijuana laws suggest that there
were individuals beyond the reach of medical marijuana
laws who may also benefit from using marijuana in lieu of
opioids. Our finding that the lower opioid prescribing rates
associated with adult-use marijuana laws were pronounced
in Schedule II opioids, further suggest that reaching these
individuals may have greater potential to reduce the
adverse consequences, such as opioid use disorder and
overdose. The 2017 Gallup Poll shows a record high 64% of
Americans in favor of adult-use marijuana laws.32 Four of
the 5 ballot initiatives for adult-use marijuana were passed
on the 2016 Election Day alone.10 In 2018, more states with
existing medical marijuana laws may vote on adult-use
marijuana bills. The potential of adult-use marijuana laws to
reduce the use and consequences of addictive opioids
deserves consideration, especially in states that have been
hit hard by the opioid epidemic. As for the states currently
reluctant to consider the outright legalization of adult-use
marijuana and those still debating medical marijuana,
policy efforts can still be made in legislation and implemen-
tation process to extend the availability of marijuana to
more people who may benefit from the therapeutic value of
marijuana.

 Limitations
This study is subject to the following limitations. First, the
aggregate nature of the study data did not allow us to iden-
tify opioid prescriptions for individual Medicaid enrollees
or individual patients treated for pain. Thus, we cannot dis-
tinguish between changes on the extensive margin (ie, the
number of individuals with any opioid prescription) and the
changes on the intensive margin (ie, the number of prescrip-
tions to those already been prescribed opioids). Another
limitation of this state-level study lies in that inferences
about individual-level mechanisms can only be deduced
from the inference for states to which the individuals
belong. Second, the data lack the necessary information to
adjust our measures of prescription counts for the varia-
tions in dosage and strength or to convert the prescription
counts into more standardized values, such as morphine
milligram equivalents. Third, the geographic proximity and
cultural similarity between states with medical or adult-use
marijuana laws and those without such laws suggests that
the laws were not likely to be “randomly assigned” to states.
Thus, as with any observational study, we cannot defini-
tively establish causality between marijuana liberalization
and opioid prescribing.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that medical and adult-use mari-
juana laws have the potential to reduce opioid prescribing
for Medicaid enrollees, a segment of population with dis-
proportionately high risk for chronic pain, opioid use disor-
der, and opioid overdose.20 Nonetheless, marijuana liberal-
ization alone cannot solve the opioid epidemic. As with
other policies evaluated in the previous literature, mari-
juana liberalization is but one potential aspect of a compre-
hensive package to tackle the epidemic.33

The Role of Cannabis Legalization in the Opioid Crisis
Kevin P. Hill, MD, MHS; Andrew J. Saxon, MD
TheUnitedStatesremainsgrippedbytheopioidcrisis.Eachday,
90 Americans die from opioid overdoses.1 Owing to the incred-
iblereachoftheopioidcrisis—ithasaffectedpeopleofeveryrace,
sex, and age across our country—many stakeholders are trying
to combat the crisis using multipronged approaches emphasiz-
ing prevention, treatment, and law enforcement.
In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, Bradford et al2 and
Wen and Hockenberry3 report results suggesting that cannabis
legalizationmayplayabeneficialroleintheopioidcrisis.Toex-
amine the association between prescribing patterns for opioids
inMedicarePartDandtheimplementationofstatemedicalcan-
nabislaws(MCLs),Bradfordetal2performedalongitudinalanaly-
sis of the number of prescriptions filled under Medicare Part D
forallopioidsasagroupandforthecategoriesofopioidsbystate
and state-level MCLs from 2010 through 2015. Medicare Part D
prescriptionsforopioidsfellby2.21milliondailydosesfilledper
year (95% CI, −4.15 to −0.27) when MCLs went into effect in a
given state. The type of MCL
implemented in these states
was important as well, with
greater reductions in opioid
prescriptions
observed
in
states with more structured
MCLs that increased access to
medical cannabis. Prescriptions for opioids fell by 3.74 million
daily doses per year (95% CI, −5.95 to −1.54) when medical can-
nabis dispensaries opened, but only by 1.79 million daily doses
peryear(95%CI,−3.36to−0.22)whenstatesonlyofferedallow-
ancesforhomecultivation.Similarly,WenandHockenberry3ana-
lyzed Medicaid prescription data from 2011 to 2016 and found
that both medical and recreational cannabis laws were associ-
atedwithannualreductionsinopioidprescribingratesof5.88%
and 6.38%, respectively.
Theseinvestigations,whilenovel,hadseveralimportantlimi-
tations.First,theyareecologicanalyses:wedonotknowwhether
patients actually avoided or reduced opioid use because of in-
creasedaccesstocannabis.Althoughtheanalysescontrolledfor
severalimportantstate-specificvariables,thereareamultitude
of other factors that may affect the association between medi-
cal cannabis and opioids in a given state and that are known to
be associated with regional variation in opioid prescribing that
werenotadjustedforsuchasracialcomposition,educationalat-
tainment,prevalenceofdisease,disability,andsuiciderates.3Fi-
nally,conclusionsdrawnfromMedicarePartDorMedicaiddata,
whichincludeprimarilydisabledindividuals,individuals65years
orolder,andotherswithlowincomelevels,suchasfamilies,chil-
dren, or pregnant women, may not be generalizable to other
demographic groups.
Nevertheless, these results do dovetail with preclinical re-
search showing that cannabinoid and opioid receptor systems
mediate common signaling pathways central to clinical issues
of tolerance, dependence, and addiction. These concepts sup-
portanecdotalevidencefrompatientswhodescribeadecreased
need for opioids to treat chronic pain after initiation of medical
cannabispharmacotherapy.ThecurrentinvestigationsbyBrad-
fordetalandWenandHockenberryalsobuildonotherevidence

ingmedicalcannabisorrecreationalcannabispoliciesmaybeas-
sociatedwithreducedopioiduseandmortality.Bachhuberetal4
usedatimeseriesanalysisofMCLsandstate-leveldeathcertifi-
cate data in the United States from 1999 to 2010 to examine the
association between the presence of state MCLs and opioid an-
algesicoverdosemortality.TheyfoundthatstateswithMCLshad
a24.8%lowermeanannualopioidoverdosemortalityrate(95%
CI, −37.5% to −9.5%; P = .003) compared with states without
MCLs. Finally, Livingston et al5 compared changes in monthly
opioid-relateddeathsbeforeandafterColoradostoresbegansell-
ing recreational cannabis and found that legalization of recre-
ational cannabis sales and use resulted in a 0.7 per month (β =
−0.68;95%CI,−1.34to−0.03)reductioninopioid-relateddeaths.
Not all studies, however, find that cannabis supplants opi-
oiduse.Forexample,Olfsonetal6 usedtheNationalEpidemio-
logic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) data

subsequentopioiduse.Theiranalysisshowedthatcannabisuse

tion opioid use (odds ratio, 5.78; 95% CI, 4.23-7.90) and opioid
use disorder (odds ratio, 7.76; 95% CI, 4.95-12.2) at follow-up.
