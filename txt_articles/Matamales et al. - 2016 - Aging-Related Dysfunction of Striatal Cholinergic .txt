In Brief
Updating previously acquired memories
is essential to adapt to changing
conditions. Matamales et al. show that
aged mice fail to integrate new and
existing learning due to deficits in the
thalamic-to-striatal cholinergic pathway,
which results in inflexible goal-directed
action.

SUMMARY
For goal-directed action to remain adaptive, new stra-
tegies are required to accommodate environmental
changes, a process for which parafascicular thalamic
modulation of cholinergic interneurons in the striatum
(PF-to-CIN) appears critical. In the elderly, however,
previously acquired experience frequently interferes
with new learning, yet the source of this effect has
remained unexplored. Here, combining sophisticated
behavioral designs, cell-specific manipulation, and
extensive neuronal imaging, we investigated the
involvement of the PF-to-CIN pathway in this process.
We found functional alterations of this circuit in aged
mice that were consistent with their incapacity to up-
date initial goal-directed learning, resulting in faulty
activation of projection neurons in the striatum. Toxi-
cogenetic ablation of CINs in young mice reproduced
these behavioral and neuronal defects, suggesting
that age-related deficits in PF-to-CIN function reduce
the ability of older individuals to resolve conflict be-
tween actions, likely contributing to impairments in
adaptive goal-directed action and executive control
in aging.
INTRODUCTION
Goal-directed actions allow individuals to exert control over the
environment in the service of desires and basic needs. Shifts in
environmental conditions can require adaptation of previously
successful strategies, which often involves the integration of
new learning with pre-existing memories. However, it has long
been known that during memory updating, new and old learning
can actively interfere, resulting in conflict and, eventually, forget-
ting (Melton and Irwin, 1987; Underwood, 1957). In the context of
normal aging, this type of memory interference is well docu-
mented in animals and humans undergoing different memory
tasks (Friedman and Castel, 2013; Hedden and Park, 2001;
Winocur, 1984) and is regarded as a major contributor to nonpa-
thological cognitive decline (Hasher et al., 1999; Pettigrew and
Martin, 2014).
Encoding the action-outcome (A-O) associations necessary for
goal-directed action has been attributed to the activity of projec-
tion neurons in posterior dorsal striatal territories, in particular
the posterior dorsomedial striatum (Shiflett et al., 2010; Yin et al.,
2005). Several studies have previously shown that manipulations
of posteromedial striatal function during instrumental learning
disrupt the encoding of the associations that constitute goal-
directed learning and that mediate choice between distinct
coursesofaction(Balleineetal.,2009).Fromanadaptiveperspec-
tive, acetylcholine in the posterior striatum has recently been
found to play a critical role in the integration of new and previously
acquired goal-directed learning; indeed, the integrity of the
parafascicularthalamicafferents(PFs)regulatingcholinergicinter-
neurons (CINs) in the posterior dorsomedial striatum (PF-to-CIN
pathway) was found to be essential to prevent interference
throughoutthisprocess(Bradfieldetal.,2013).Accordingly,adap-
tation of striatal synaptic processes appears to depend on cholin-
ergic tone; in the absence of acetylcholine, new learning is likely
to undergo interference from existing learning, perhaps through
dysregulation ofstriatalprojectionneurons(Aokietal.,2015;Brad-
field et al., 2013; Brown et al., 2010; Newman et al., 2012).
Although an overall decline of striatal systems has been re-
ported in physiological and pathological aging (Selden et al.,
1994), it is unknown whether interference in A-O encoding oc-
curs in normal aging and, in particular, whether the aged striatum
can efficiently update pre-existing learning when A-O relation-
ships change. Here, we investigated the functional integrity of
the PF-to-CIN pathway in aged mice and assessed their capac-
ity to adapt to changes in initially acquired A-O contingencies. To
provide direct evidence that an age-related PF-to-CIN deficit
causes interference in goal-directed learning, we specifically dis-
rupted this circuit through targeted ablation of CINs in young
transgenic mice. Finally, we examined the effect of these alter-
ations on the initiation of goal-directed action and the function
of projection neurons in the posterior striatum using extensive
profiling of neuronal activity.
RESULTS
Aged Mice Show Deterioration in Parafascicular
Thalamostriatal Processes as well as Altered Activity in
Striatal Cholinergic Interneurons
Activity of CINs in posterior striatal regions is largely governed by
the glutamatergic inputs originating from caudal intralaminar

 thalamic nuclei, such as the PF (Ding et al., 2010; Lapper and
Bolam, 1992). In the striatum, CINs provide the main source of
acetylcholine (Bolam et al., 1984) and are known to confer critical
modulation to striatal projection neurons (SPNs) in synchrony
with the dopaminergic signal originating in the midbrain (Aosaki
et al., 2010; Ding et al., 2010; Threlfell et al., 2012). The PF-to-CIN
pathway is, therefore, considered essential to modulate associa-
tive plasticity in dorsal striatal regions (Goldberg and Reynolds,
2011), and its projection to the posterior dorsomedial striatum
(pDMS) has been recently shown to be critical for proper inte-
gration of new memories with pre-existing memories during
adaptation of goal-directed action (Bradfield et al., 2013). On
this account, and given that behavioral flexibility is commonly
impaired in aging, we sought to investigate the degree of func-
tional preservation of the PF-to-CIN pathway in the pDMS of
naive young (2–3 months old [m.o.]) and aged (20–22 m.o.)
mice. We first assessed the relative activity of PF neurons by de-
tecting phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (p-rpS6), a widely
used neuronal activity marker (Bertran-Gonzalez et al., 2012;
Bradfield et al., 2013; Knight et al., 2012) (Figure 1A). We found
a modest but significant reduction of p-rpS6 signal in PF neurons
of aged mice (t(14) = 2.298, p < 0.05) (Figure 1B), suggesting mi-
nor deficits in upstream PF-to-CIN circuits. We next compared
the extent of cortico- and thalamostriatal inputs in these
mice through quantification of VGluT1+ (cortical) and VGluT2+
(thalamic) terminals in the pDMS (Lei et al., 2013) (Figures 1C
and 1D). Double immunofluorescence analysis showed a
remarkable decrease of VGluT2+ terminal density in aged mice
(t(14) = 2.646, p < 0.05), whereas VGluT1+ processes in the
same images remained unchanged (t(14) = 0.620, p = 0.545) (Fig-
ure 1D). We next studied whether CINs of the pDMS consistently
presented age-related alterations in their neuronal firing. We
used young (2 m.o.) and aged (22 m.o.) ChATBAC-eGFP reporter
mice, which allow visualizing CINs in slices through their intrinsic
expression of eGFP, as confirmed by post hoc biocytin labeling
(Figure 1E). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings confirmed the
characteristic features of CINs, which were unchanged in young
and aged groups (Figure S1, available online). Cell-attached re-
cordings in the presence of synaptic blockers revealed that
both young and aged CINs presented tonic firing activity (Fig-
ure 1F), although the frequency of action potential firing was
significantly higher in aged cells (t(36) = �2.999, p < 0.01) (Fig-
ure 1G). However, firing patterns in young CINs were more irreg-
ular, as revealed by the higher incidence of burst-like activity
(Figure 1F) and a higher coefficient of variation of action potential
firing (t(25.77) = 2.649, p < 0.05) (Figure 1H). To test whether the
changes in rate/pattern measured in slice preparations are
reflective of activity changes of CINs in vivo, we used detection
of p-rpS6 immunofluorescence, which has been shown to be
particularly sensitive to burst-firing activity in CINs (Bertran-Gon-
zalez et al., 2012). Confocal analysis of nearly 300 CINs in the

 pDMS revealed a clear decrease in p-rpS6 signal intensity in
aged as compared to young mice (t(203.98) = 2.323, p = 0.021)
(Figures 1I and 1J), in line with their decreased propensity to un-
dergo burst firing. Together, these data provide clear evidence
of functional alterations at both ends of the PF-to-CIN pathway
in aged mice.
Initial Goal-Directed Learning Is Preserved in Aging
In light of recent studies reporting impairments in the acquisition
of goal-directed action in healthy aged individuals (de Wit et al.,
2014), we next sought to compare the ability of young and aged
mice to encode different A-O associations during goal-directed
learning, based on procedures of instrumental conditioning
that we previously established in rats (Bradfield et al., 2013) (Fig-
ure 2A). After mild food restriction, the mice were trained to press
two levers (actions A1 and A2), each delivering calorically equiv-
alent but differently flavored food outcomes (O1 and O2) (instru-
mental training). Both young and aged mice escalated their
lever press (LP) performance as the effort required to obtain out-
comes increased (Figures 2B and 2D): mixed ANOVA (within-
subject factor was training and between-subjects factor was
age) showed that both age groups increased LP responding
throughout
the
different
periods
of
instrumental
training
(F(23,506) = 85.017, p < 0.001). However, this performance
was significantly influenced by age, as there was a significant
training 3 age interaction (F(23,506) = 10.64, p < 0.001) and a
main effect of age (F(1,22) = 27.17, p < 0.001) (Figures 2B and
2D). Importantly, lever pressing on the two levers (A1 and A2)
was similar within each group throughout training. Regardless
of their different LP rates, separate one-way repeated-measures
(RM) ANOVAs revealed that both age groups showed clear
acquisition of instrumental behavior (results for young were as
follows: F(23, 253) = 57.37, p < 0.001; results for aged were as fol-
lows: F(23,253) = 29.02, p < 0.001), suggesting that the initial A-O
associations were correctly encoded. To directly confirm this as-
sociation, we exposed all animals to a first-outcome-specific
devaluation test (initial devaluation) (Figure 2A), which evaluated
the effect of satiety to one or the other outcome on the choice be-
tween the two trained instrumental actions (Balleine and Dickin-
son, 1998). If the mice correctly encoded these contingencies
(i.e., A1-O1 and A2-O2), satiety on one of the outcomes (e.g.,
O1) should reduce performance of the action associated with
this particular outcome (A1; devalued) relative to performance
of the other, still valued action (A2; valued). To test this predic-
tion, mice were given unrestricted access to either O1 or O2
for 1 hr followed by a choice extinction test, in which both levers
were available but no outcome was delivered. Two-way RM
ANOVAs (within-subjects factors were trial and lever) revealed
that all mice displayed significantly different LP rates on the
valued and devalued levers in the course of the two consecutive
trials (results for young were as follows: F(1,11) = 6.62, p = 0.026;
results for aged were as follows: F(1,11) = 11.16, p = 0.007). This
indicated that both age groups correctly encoded the A-O con-
tingencies during training, as was reflected in their choice: all
mice significantly reduced their performance toward the action
that, during training, delivered the sated outcome (which
became devalued) relative to the other action (which remained
valued) (Figure 2C). Therefore, these results showed that despite

Figure 2. Aged Mice Encode Conflicting
A-O Contingencies
(A) Experimental paradigm. Initial learning was as
follows: mice were instrumentally trained to ac-
quire a first set of A-O contingencies, where two
different LP responses (A1 and A2) provided either
grain or purified pellets (O1 and O2). Establish-
ment of initial contingencies was tested through
outcome-specific devaluation tests, where mice
were sated for 1 hr on one or the other outcome
(i.e., O1 or O2) prior to a choice test (A1 versus A2).
New learning was as follows: mice were trained on
the reversed contingencies for a few days prior to a
second round of devaluation and choice testing.

(B; days 1–14) and new (D; days 17–21) A-O
contingencies. Data show combined A1-O1 and

 an overall reduction in LP performance with aging, the initial
encoding of A-O contingencies is not affected by age.
Aged Mice Fail to Adjust to Changes in A-O
Contingencies
Next, we assessed in these mice whether A-O encoding was
appropriately adjusted when a new set of contingencies was
introduced. The mice were retrained for 5 days on the reversed
contingencies (reversal contingencies were as follows: A1-O2;
A2-O1) before being exposed to a second outcome devaluation
test (new devaluation) (Figure 2A). Reversal of contingencies did
not affect performance across sessions, as both young and aged
groups continued to gradually increase their LP rates (Figure 2D).
The new outcome-specific devaluation test revealed that the
most recent A-O contingencies were correctly integrated in
young mice: again, performance of the action that, after reversal,
delivered the now devalued outcome was reduced compared to
the other action (F(1,11) = 12.92, p = 0.004) (Figure 2E). In contrast,
aged mice responded similarly on both levers, indicating a deficit
in encoding the new set of A-O contingencies upon reversal
(F(1,11) = 2.03, p = 0.182) (Figure 2E). Video recordings of the
new devaluation test revealed the specificity of this effect:
whereas young mice showed a clear choice toward the lever pre-
dicting the valued outcome (Movie S1), aged mice showed no
evidence that they could either express the current or recall
the previous contingencies (Movie S2), indicating that in aged
mice, pre-existing and new learning interfered with one another,
resulting in conflicted selection of goal-directed action.
Selective Interruption of the PF-to-CIN Pathway
Reproduces the Interference Effect Observed
in Aged Mice
In order to establish the link between the PF and CIN deficits
observed in aged mice and their ability to integrate new with prior
learning during goal-directed action, we undertook a toxicoge-
netic approach so as to specifically interrupt the PF-to-CIN
pathway in the pDMS. Our strategy consisted of inducing a
downstream interruption of this circuit in young transgenic
mice by selectively ablating CINs in the pDMS, thus leaving other
synaptic targets of the PF in the striatum (such as the striatal pro-
jection neurons; Castle et al., 2005) intact. We used the DT-iDTR
system, which relies on the specific vulnerability of transgenic
mice to low doses of diphtheria toxin (DT) conferred by targeted
expression of the diphtheria toxin receptor (iDTR) to the cells of
interest (Buch et al., 2005; Durieux et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2015).
In young ChAT-Cre+/� iDTR+/� transgenic mice (2–3 m.o.) selec-
tively expressing iDTR in CINs (ChAT-Cre:iDTR), we bilaterally
microinjected a very low dose of DT (1 ml at 150 pg/ml) or its
vehicle (PBS, controls) into the pDMS through stereotaxic sur-
gery (Figure 3A). Confocal microscopy confirmed that CINs

played no difference in the acquisition of goal-directed re-

interaction (F(4.51, 99.2) = 1.829, p = 0.121). Moreover, when
exposed to the first outcome-specific devaluation test (initial
devaluation), both PBS- and DT-treated mice significantly
reduced their rate of responding toward the devalued outcome
at the expense of the valued one (Figure 3E): three-way mixed
ANOVA (within-subject factors were trial and lever and be-
tween-subjects factor was treatment) revealed a highly signifi-
cant overall effect of lever (F(1, 22) = 17.56, p < 0.0001), but not
lever 3 treatment interaction (F(1, 22) = 0.17, p = 0.682). This
showed that depletion of CINs in the pDMS did not affect acqui-
sition of instrumental actions and initial A-O contingencies. We
then assessed the ability of these mice to adjust the initial A-O
encoding to a change in contingencies. The mice were retrained
on the reversed contingencies and exposed to a second
outcome devaluation test (new devaluation; see Figure 2A). We
found that the new A-O relationships were not correctly inte-
grated in DT-treated mice, which presented a conflicted choice
over the levers predicting valued and devalued outcomes
(Figure 3G). Accordingly, a three-way mixed ANOVA now re-
vealed a nonsignificant overall effect of lever (F(1, 22) = 0.747,
p = 0.397), although with a significant lever 3 treatment interac-
tion (F(1, 22) = 4.24, p < 0.05). Separate two-way RM ANOVAs
(within-subject factors were trial and lever) also supported this
conclusion, revealing a significant effect of lever in PBS-treated
(F(1, 11) = 5.642, p < 0.05), but not DT-treated (F(1, 11) = 0.629,
p = 0.444), mice. Together, these results showed that disrupting
the PF-to-CIN pathway in young ChAT-Cre:iDTR mice by selec-
tively depleting CINs in the pDMS reproduced the interference
between pre-existing and new associations during goal-directed
learning observed previously in aged mice.
Based on previous studies showing improved reversal
learning through cholinergic manipulations (Tait et al., 2013),
we next explored the possibility of rescuing the above interfer-
ence by manipulating the activity of CINs in aged mice using
the hM3Dq designer receptor exclusively activated by designer
drug (DREADDs) approach that induces burst-like firing in
response to the synthetic drug clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) (Alex-
ander et al., 2009) (Figure S2). We first demonstrated that selec-
tive expression of hM3Dq in striatal CINs of young ChAT-Cre+/+
mice resulted in a marked increase of p-rpS6 signal after 30 and
60 min of the injection of CNO (Figures S2A–S2C), likely reflect-
ing burst-like firing (Bertran-Gonzalez et al., 2012). Next, we
subjected a group of aged ChAT-Cre:hM3Dq mice (20–24
m.o.) to similar instrumental and outcome devaluation proce-
dures as above (Figure S2D). As we had found earlier in aged
WT (wild-type) mice (see Figure 2), aged ChAT-Cre:hM3Dq
mice were able to devalue initial A-O contingencies (F(1,10) =
12.84, p < 0.01) but failed to adjust their learning when
contingencies were reversed (F(1,10) = 0.47, p = 0.50) (Figures
S2E–S2H). Importantly, CNO did not reduce instrumental per-
formance during reversal in aged ChAT-Cre:hM3Dq mice (Fig-
ure S2G) but failed to improve their capacity to recall the new
set of contingencies, as they too expressed a conflicted choice
during the new devaluation test (F(1,10) = 1.89, p = 0.19) (Fig-
ure S2H). Confocal microscopy confirmed that the activity of
CINs had been successfully enhanced by CNO in all aged
mice, as revealed by the strong treatment 3 hM3Dq expression
interaction (F(1,2930) = 17.38, p < 0.0001) (Figure S2I). Although
the magnitude of the genetic manipulation could have been
insufficient to restore function in aged CINs, our results strongly
suggest that a global nonmodulated increase of activity of the
target neurons in the PF-to-CIN pathway is not a suitable strat-
egy to promote the interlacing between initial and new learning
in aged mice; therefore, a fine modulation of PF afferents in the
striatum is more likely to be required to precisely and timely
modulate the activity of CINs during the integration of new
learning (Bradfield et al., 2013).
Aged Mice Show Deficits in Initiation of Specific
Goal-Directed Action
We reasoned that a strong associative interference should not
only affect the ability of mice to selectively reduce responding
in choice situations (as in the satiety-devaluation procedures
above) but also their capacity to increase their performance
when A-O associations are recalled. To test this, we retrained
the mice on the most recent set of A-O contingencies for a further
5 days after the last devaluation test (data not shown) and chal-
lenged them using an outcome-selective reinstatement test the
following day (Figure 4). This test is designed to evaluate the initi-
ation of specific actions upon retrieval of one of the two out-
comes (Balleine and Ostlund, 2007; Ostlund and Balleine,
2007). After 10 min of extinction, the mice underwent four rein-
statement trials, prior to each of which a single outcome (either
O1 or O2) was delivered (Figure 4A). LP responding on the two
levers was recorded 1 min before and after each outcome deliv-
ery (pre- and post-reinstatement periods). Responses on each
lever were categorized as congruent or incongruent, according
to each individual’s most recent A-O relationships and the
outcome delivered in each trial (Figure 4A). Our results showed
a certain selectivity of congruent versus incongruent responses
in young mice: one-way RM ANOVA (within-subject factor was
period) revealed significant differences in LP rates across the
various periods of reinstatement (F(3,33) = 7.16, p < 0.001), and
Bonferroni pairwise comparisons showed a significant increase
in responding on congruent (p < 0.05), but not incongruent
(p = 0.198), levers (Figure 4B). Aged mice, however, showed
similar LP rates on the two levers across the different reinstate-
ment periods (F(1.855,20.410) = 0.62, p = 0.516) with no significant
lever pressing in pre- versus post-reinstatement periods (Fig-
ure 4B). More importantly, two-way mixed ANOVA (within-
subject factor was period and between-subjects factor was
age) revealed a strong period 3 age interaction (F(3,66) = 8.647,
p < 0.001), indicating that the reinstated outcome failed to induce
instrumental responding in aged mice.

Neuron 90, 362–373, April 20, 2016
 Accordingly, we next sought to evaluate the capacity of young
and aged mice to initiate congruent responses in post-reinstate-
ment periods. To test this, we analyzed the structure of behavior
by quantifying the number of time-stamped LPs before and after
reward delivery (Figures 4C–4E). A frequency distribution anal-
ysis revealed a pronounced elevation of LP responding on the
congruent lever for at least 2 min after outcome delivery in young
mice, whereas aged mice showed a gap of responding along
the first 30–40 s of post-reinstatement, before engaging in base-
line LP activity (Figure 4C). We next studied the pattern
of responding by plotting the temporal relationships between
consecutive
congruent
presses
(interpress
intervals,
IPIs)
executed by young and aged mice in all pre- and post-reinstate-
ment periods (Figure 4D). Young mice increased the response
frequency and speed after consuming the reinstated outcome,
as indicated by the higher number of equidistant responses
that preferentially fell below 1 s intervals in post-reinstatement
periods (red squares), a trend that was absent in aged mice
(Figure 4D). Quantification of congruent IPIs in each period
confirmed this effect (Figure 4E), as a mixed ANOVA analysis
(within-subject
factor
was
period
and
between-subjects
factor was age) revealed a significant period 3 age interaction
(F(1,22) = 7.69, p < 0.05). Simple effects confirmed that young
mice significantly reduced their IPIs in post-reinstatement pe-
riods (t(11) = 2.413, p < 0.05), whereas aged mice did not (t(11) =
�1.747, p = 0.108). These results indicate that aging not only
impaired the ability of mice to select new goal-directed actions,
but also affected their capacity to initiate these actions. Interest-
ingly, these alterations were not observed in mice with depletion
of CINs exclusively in the pDMS (Figure S3), which suggests that
CINs in the pDMS serve the function of maintaining the speci-
ficity of goal-directed action upon changes in A-O contingency,
but are not necessary to mediate the initiation of actions (specific
or not) once the contingencies have been retrieved.
Aged Striatal Projection Neurons Are Not Activated
during Reinstatement of Goal-Directed Action
We next explored how reinstatement of goal-directed action in-
fluences the activity of striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs),
which comprise �95% of the neurons in the rodent striatum
and are responsible for relaying information to downstream
basal ganglia networks, ultimately defining striatal function

(A) Experimental design. The test consisted of four equally spaced reinstatement trials distributed across a 38 min session (time points indicated) with alternate
delivery of outcomes (O1/O2/O2/O1). Each trial consisted of the following series of events: lever retraction / 10 s / outcome delivery / 10 s / lever
insertion. LP responses on each lever were recorded for 60 s before (gray) and after (blue) each reinstatement trial. The congruent (Cong) and incongruent (Incong)
nature of the responses was established according to each individual’s most recent contingency and the outcome delivered in each trial.

 (Bolam et al., 2000; Matamales et al., 2009). We conducted
a quantitative immunofluorescence analysis of the previously
trained mice to assess the activity of SPNs in the posterior stria-
tum triggered by performance during the reinstatement test (Fig-
ure 5). In order to detect cellular changes induced by the integra-
tion of A-O contingencies, we trained in parallel a group of young
and aged controls, which were given a yoked exposure to the
outcome without any A-O contingent relationship being formed.
We used detection of an activity-dependent phosphorylated
form of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (phospho-p44/
42 MAPK [Erk1/2]; p-ERK1/2) as a marker for neuronal activity,
a widely used readout of SPN activation (Bertran-Gonzalez
et al., 2008; Pascoli et al., 2012; Valjent et al., 2000) (Figure 5A).
The identity of the large majority of activated neurons in the stria-
tum was confirmed through codetection of DARPP-32, a specific
marker of SPNs (Matamales et al., 2009) (Figure 5A). We found
that in young mice, selective reinstatement induced a strong
activation of SPNs in all regions of the posterior striatum, as evi-
denced by the marked increase of p-ERK1/2-labeled neurons
detected in mice that had received A-O contingent training
compared to yoked controls (Figures 5B–5D). Remarkably, this
effect was absent in contingently trained aged mice, which dis-
played low levels of p-ERK1/2 everywhere in the striatum,
including pDMS but also dorsolateral (pDLS) areas (Figures
5B–5D). Two-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of training
on ERK1/2 phosphorylation (results for pDMS were as follows:
F(1,60) = 9.37, p < 0.01; results for pDLS were as follows:
F(1,60) = 7.99, p < 0.01), but not of age (results for pDMS were
as follows: F(1,60) = 1.18, p = 0.281; results for pDLS were as fol-
lows: F(1,60) = 3.86, p = 0.054). Importantly, there was a strong
training 3 age interaction (results for pDMS were as follows:
F(1,60) = 13.72, p < 0.0001; results for pDLS were as follows:
F(1,60) = 14.86, p < 0.0001), in agreement with the lack of
p-ERK1/2 induction observed in aged reinstated mice (Figures
5C and 5D). These results indicated that in aged mice exposed
to specific reinstatement, activation of SPNs was prevented in
all areas of the posterior striatum, including medial territories
but also, unexpectedly, lateral regions.

Figure 5. Aged Mice Show Deficient Activation of SPNs
(A) Confocal images of the pDMS and pDLS from mice immediately perfused after the reinstatement test. Activated SPNs were identified through im-
munodetection of p-ERK1/2. Colabeling with DARPP-32 confirmed that p-ERK1/2-labeled cells were SPNs. For each activated SPN, an individual ROI was
automatically drawn around the soma, and the Cartesian coordinates (x, y, in pixels) of the centroid of individual SPNs were mapped (31,611 SPNs quantified in
total).

between p-ERK1/2+ neuron counts in several striatal subdivisions (left axis) and different aspects of performance recorded during the reinstatement test (bottom

relationship. The plot on the right shows the probability value (p value; color coded) of the Pearson’s correlation test for each individual comparison, where green
(p < 0.05) indicates that the test is statistically significant, and white (p > 0.05) indicates that it is not. Source data: Table S6B.

Neuron 90, 362–373, April 20, 2016
 We next used our extensive dataset to identify the striatal re-
gions that were primarily engaged during the initiation of action.
To test this, we conducted a correlation study involving all
reinstated mice in which the SPN activity profile, derived from
p-ERK1/2 detection recorded in different areas of the anterior
and posterior striatum in each mouse, was contrasted with their
specific performance on the congruent and incongruent levers
expressed during 2 min pre- and post-reinstatement (Figure 5E).
We found that the total LP activity displayed by each mouse on
either lever in the course of the reinstatement test (overall) did not
significantly correlate with the p-ERK1/2 activity recorded in any
of the striatal regions analyzed, suggesting that the observed
striatal activity patterns were not due to overall motor execution
expressed during the test (Valjent et al., 2001). Instead, SPN ac-
tivity in the striatum exclusively correlated with the performance
on the congruent lever during post-reinstatement periods (Fig-
ure 5E, Post-Cong column), indicating that the striatal activity
displayed by the mice was specifically reflecting initiation of
congruent instrumental performance. Interestingly, the highest
correlation was found in pDLS, suggesting that this region is
strongly engaged during the initiation of action. These results
therefore suggest that the deficient activation of striatal output
neurons in posterior dorsomedial and dorsolateral territories of
aged mice could underpin their deficits in action selection and
initiation, respectively.
Altered CIN Function Prevents the Activation of
Striatal SPNs
To further study the role of medial and lateral striatal territories
in the selection and initiation of action, we conducted a similar
profiling of activated SPNs in the pDMS and pDLS of ChAT-
Cre:iDTR mice, in which specific depletion of CINs in the
pDMS produced a conflict in action selection (see Figure 3) but
did not affect action initiation (see Figure S3). We found in these
mice a striking reduction in the number of p-ERK1/2-labeled
neurons in medial, but not lateral, regions of the striatum (Fig-
ure 6A): two-way mixed ANOVA (within-subject factor was re-
gion and between-subjects factor was treatment) revealed a
marked effect of treatment on p-ERK1/2 activation (F(1,44) =
14.40, p < 0.0001) and a strong treatment 3 region interaction
(F(1,44) = 29.25, p < 0.0001). Simple effects analysis confirmed
that induction of p-ERK1/2 was only prevented in the pDMS
(t(29.06) = 6.4, p < 0.0001), but not in the pDLS (t(44) = �1.73,
p = 0.86) (Figure 6A). Furthermore, comapping of both CIN+
and p-ERK1/2+ neurons revealed that areas that were devoid
of CINs in DT-treated mice also showed a dramatic reduction
of activated SPNs, whereas in PBS-treated controls, both popu-
lations were distributed throughout the entire striatal tissue (Fig-
ure 6B). We directly addressed whether the absence of CINs
correlated with reduced activation of SPNs by identifying, in
each DT-treated striatum, the regions that were specifically
devoid of CINs (CIN-depleted; mostly medial) and distinguished
them from regions with normal presence of CINs (intact; mostly
lateral) (Figure 6C, left panel). Within-subjects comparisons re-
vealed that striatal areas with specific depletion of CINs showed
significantly less density of activated SPNs than adjacent nonde-
pleted regions (t(18) = �2.47, p < 0.05), which showed activation
levels that were comparable to PBS-treated controls (Figure 6C).
Correspondingly, reanalysis of glutamatergic terminals and CIN
function in lateral regions of the posterior striatum of young
and aged naive WT mice revealed similar reductions to those
originally observed in the pDMS: we found a marked decrease
of VGluT2+ (t(14) = 3.310, p < 0.01), but not VGluT1+ (t(14) =
�0.054, p = 0.958), terminals in aged mice (Figure 6D), and a

 reduced p-rpS6 fluorescence signal in pDLS CINs (results for
pDLS were as follows: t(169) = 7.205, p < 0.0001) (Figure 6E).
These results therefore suggest that the deficits of SPN activa-
tion in pDLS regions in aged mice could be due to a deficient tha-
lamostriatal-CIN drive in lateral striatal regions and, combined
with their deficits in the pDMS, could contribute to their inability
to initiate goal-directed action upon reinstatement.
DISCUSSION
Here, by combining a sophisticated behavioral paradigm
with comprehensive neuronal assessments and targeted cell
manipulation, we demonstrate fundamental alterations of goal-
directed learning associated with severe deficits of striatal func-
tion in aged mice. We found an age-related deterioration in the
PF-to-CIN pathway, a circuit that is proposed to mediate the
integration of new and existing learning during goal-directed
action. In support of this view, we observed that aged mice
correctly encoded initial A-O associations, but this learning pro-
actively interfered with new learning when the A-O contingencies
changed, resulting in conflict in the selection of initial and new
goal-directed actions. This deficit was reflected by a striking
absence of striatal projection neuron activation observed during
the expression of conflicted action selection, which likely
hampered the adaptation of goal-directed learning in the aged.
Importantly, both behavioral and neuronal deficits observed
in aged mice were reproduced by specific disruption of the
PF-to-CIN pathway in young mice, directly confirming that the
age-related deterioration of this circuit involves failure to inter-
lace new with existing information during goal-directed learning.
Thus, our data suggest that impaired thalamostriatal function
and the resulting conflict in action selection contribute signifi-
cantly to compromise goal-directed action in aged individuals.
Memory Interference in Aging: Consequences for
Adaptive Goal-Directed Action
The behavioral impairment observed in this study does not
reflect a complete insensitivity of aged individuals to new
learning, as would have been suggested by recall of only the
initially established A-O relationships. Rather, our findings
demonstrate clear interference between previously formed and
recently incorporated information, as revealed by the animals’
inability to express either the newly integrated or the initially es-
tablished A-O contingencies (see Movie S2). Indeed, similar
interference is commonly observed in aged individuals in other
memory systems (Friedman and Castel, 2013; Hay and Jacoby,
1999; Winocur and Moscovitch, 1983). Hasher and colleagues
presented the interference problem in aging as a loss of inhibi-
tory control, where deficient cognitive inhibition fails to clear irrel-
evant information from working memory, resulting in distraction
and inaccurate responses that contribute to cognitive decline
in the elderly (Dempster and Brainerd, 1995; Hasher et al.,
1999). In the context of goal-directed learning, the conse-
quences of such a conflict in action selection can be particularly
detrimental. Adapting to changes in existing A-O contingencies
requires that animals and humans not only exploit successful
strategies to current decision problems but also explore alterna-
tive solutions (Balleine, 2011). In order to do so, it is necessary to
interlace existing memories with new learning in a manner that
reduces interference between them; otherwise, the new, the ex-
isting, or indeed both new and existing memories could be lost
altogether (Underwood, 1957), with dramatic consequences for
adaptation. Therefore, regardless of the cognitive domain con-
cerned, memory interference appears to be a common feature
of the aging brain (Pettigrew and Martin, 2014), and the presence
of interference in goal-directed learning reported here positions
this cognitive deficit as a major candidate compromising the
adaptive control of action.
Aging, Acetylcholine, and Striatal Dysfunction
Striatal acetylcholine is involved in particular forms of adaptive
behavior and behavioral flexibility in different spatial memory
paradigms (Brown et al., 2010; Havekes et al., 2011) as well as
attentional tasks (Aoki et al., 2015). Indeed, impairments in flex-
ibility during reversal learning are well documented in aged ro-
dents (Means and Holsten, 1992); the ability to adapt previously
acquired responses is the first feature affected in nonpathologi-
cal aging (Rahner-Welsch et al., 1995). Although the precise al-
terations accounting for these deficits need further analysis,
recent pharmacological studies point to the dysregulation of
striatal acetylcholine as a major contributor to adaptive problems
in aging (Nieves-Martinez et al., 2012; Tait et al., 2013), consis-
tent with the cholinergic reductions detected in the striatum of
aged rodents (Sherman and Friedman, 1990). We previously re-
ported that manipulations of PF projections modulating the ac-
tivity of CINs in the pDMS selectively impaired the rat’s ability
to encode new A-O contingencies, resulting in conflicted goal-
directed action (Bradfield et al., 2013). All these and other studies
therefore suggest that acetylcholine, in the striatum and else-
where, serves the function of interlacing new and pre-existing
learning (Hasselmo and Bower, 1993; Yu and Dayan, 2002),
and alterations of cholinergic tone—such as those occurring in
aging—are likely to result in interference (Bradfield et al.,
2013). Here, we found deteriorated parafascicular thalamic func-
tion and thalamostriatal connectivity in aged mice, which likely
explains the altered firing patterns and reduced signaling activity
observed in downstream CINs of the pDMS. Importantly, the
involvement of this circuit in memory interlacing was further
confirmed in the present study, as selective ablation of CINs in
the pDMS of young mice reproduced the interference deficits
observed in aged mice. CINs are known to provide the main
supply of acetylcholine in the striatum (Bolam et al., 1984), and
therefore it is very likely that nonoptimal firing of these neurons
due to a deficient PF-to-CIN drive in aged individuals results in
major neuromodulatory dysregulations in downstream projec-
tion neurons and beyond. One possibility, as suggested by our
data, is that aged CINs fail to display clear burst-pause and
rebound patterns of firing, which are in phase with incoming
sensory stimuli and are thought to gate specific corticostriatal
plasticity (Ding et al., 2010; Goldberg and Reynolds, 2011), a
mechanism that is now considered essential for the encoding
of attentional and associative processes in the striatum (Apicella,
2007; Kimura et al., 2004; Schulz and Reynolds, 2013). Instead,
CINs in aged mice appeared to fire at a higher frequency
but lower variability, which likely reflects the basal regular
tonicity that is expected from a cell that is slowly escaping
370

 thalamostriatal control (Bennett and Wilson, 1999). This finding
in aged mice complements our previous study in rats, in which
abrupt denervation of PF thalamostriatal processes dramatically
silenced firing activity in these neurons (Bradfield et al., 2013).
Altogether, our results are consistent with the failure to bypass
the age-related associative interference reported here, where
a global (nonmodulated) enhancement of neuronal activity
in downstream CINs through pharmacogenetics proved to be
insufficient to prevent the conflict between prior and new
learning in aged transgenic mice (see Figure S2). Hence, evi-
dence builds to support the need for an exquisitely tuned
modulation of CINs by thalamostriatal processes for specific
associative plasticity to occur in the striatum.
Regional Particularities of the Thalamostriatal Pathway
Similar to other afferents to the striatum, intralaminar thalamos-
triatal projections are topographically and functionally orga-
nized, with different rostro-caudal nuclei invading longitudinally
oriented striatal territories (Smith et al., 2004). In rodents, medial
parafascicular fibers project principally to the dorsomedial stria-
tum (Berendse and Groenewegen, 1990; Bradfield et al., 2013),
whereas lateral parafascicular and more rostral intralaminar
nuclei invade more lateral striatal regions (Berendse and Groene-
wegen, 1990; Desche
ˆ nes et al., 1996). However, the functional
particularities of each thalamostriatal territory remain elusive.
Here, the conflicted patterns of action selection observed in
ChAT-Cre:iDTR mice devoid of CINs in the pDMS are consistent
with the reduced activity in SPNs from medial striatal territories
(as reflected by reduced p-ERK1/2 activation), further sup-
porting the important claim that the PF-to-CIN pathway in the
pDMS mediates the integration of new and previous learning
through modulation of striatal output neurons in posteromedial
striatal regions (Bradfield et al., 2013). On the other hand, unlike
aged animals, interruption of the thalamostriatal pathway in the
pDMS of young mice did not affect their ability to initiate goal-
directed actions upon reinstatement (see Figure S3), which coin-
cided with an intact circuitry and activity in the pDLS. In aged
mice, however, a more extended deterioration of thalamostriatal
systems affecting both caudal and rostral intralaminar projec-
tions may explain the widespread reduction of SPN activation
observed in vast territories of the posterior striatum. This could
contribute to the additional deficits of action initiation reported
here in aged mice, which, combined with the initial action selec-
tion problems, can further compromise the ability of aged indi-
viduals to adapt their goal-directed learning. Further studies
will thus determine the precise role of rostral intralaminar thala-
mostriatal projections in goal-directed action, and to what extent
these circuits are deteriorated in aging.
In conclusion, we provide evidence for a severe cholinergic
and striatal deficit during normal aging in mice that affects their
capacity to adapt pre-existing strategies to new conditions in
the environment. Our findings have fundamental implications
for the active modulation of action selection in aging and point
to conflicted learning and impaired thalamostriatal function as
major processes compromising flexibility of goal-directed action
in aged individuals, something that contributes to, and poten-
tially serves to engender, the cognitive disability commonly
observed in aging, particularly apathy and dysexecutive syn-
drome (Hanna-Pladdy, 2007; Levy and Dubois, 2006; Macfar-
lane et al., 2013).
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Full details of all experimental procedures are provided in the Supplemental
Information. All experiments were approved by the University of Queens-
land Animal Ethics Committee (027-12 and 327-11). WT (Animal Research
Centre), ChATBAC-eGFP, ChAT-Cre+/� iDTR+/�, and ChAT-Cre+/+ (JAX)
C57BL/6 mouse strains were used in this study. Young (2 m.o.) and aged
(20–24 m.o.) mice were trained in Med Associates operant chambers, and
behavioral data were recorded by Med-PC-IV and MATLAB software. All
confocal imaging, electrophysiology procedures, stereotaxic surgery, behav-
ioral designs, immunofluorescence procedures, and image acquisition and
analysis are similar to previous studies (Bertran-Gonzalez et al., 2012; Brad-
field et al., 2013). All source datasets are included in the Supplemental Infor-
mation. Full original image file sets are publicly shared in QBI OMERO Cloud.
