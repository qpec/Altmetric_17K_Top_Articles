In Brief
The brain is involved in diet-induced
obesity and its associated metabolic
disturbances. Using mice with neuron-
specific deletion of the small GTPase
Rap1, Kaneko et al. demonstrate that
brain Rap1 plays a central role in dietary
obesity, glucose imbalance, peripheral
insulin resistance, and central leptin
resistance.

SUMMARY
The CNS contributes to obesity and metabolic dis-
ease; however, the underlying neurobiological path-
ways remain to be fully established. Here, we show
that the small GTPase Rap1 is expressed in multiple
hypothalamic nuclei that control whole-body meta-
bolism and is activated in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced
obesity. Genetic ablation of CNS Rap1 protects mice
from dietary obesity, glucose imbalance, and insulin
resistance in the periphery and from HFD-induced
neuropathological changes in the hypothalamus,
including diminished cellular leptin sensitivity and
increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and
inflammation. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibi-
tion of CNS Rap1 signaling normalizes hypothalamic
ER stress and inflammation, improves cellular leptin
sensitivity, and reduces body weight in mice with
dietary obesity. We also demonstrate that Rap1
mediates leptin resistance via interplay with ER
stress. Thus, neuronal Rap1 critically regulates leptin
sensitivity
and
mediates
HFD-induced
obesity
and hypothalamic pathology and may represent a
potential therapeutic target for obesity treatment.
INTRODUCTION
The CNS has been long established as robust homeostatic sys-
tems for the maintenance of normal body weight and euglycemia
(Coll et al., 2007; Dietrich and Horvath, 2013; Morton et al., 2006;
Myers and Olson, 2012; Ryan et al., 2012). The crucial role of the
CNS in the development of obesity is also becoming increasingly
apparent with recent discoveries of obesity susceptibility genes
that are often associated with CNS functions (Locke et al., 2015).
Obesogenic conditions such as high-fat diet (HFD) feeding
cause these CNS homeostatic systems to shift toward positive
energy balance, which ultimately leads to obesity (Ryan et al.,
2012). However, the neural pathways that actively respond to
HFD feeding and mediate adiposity under overnutrition remain
incompletely characterized.
HFD leads to multiple, profound neuropathological changes in
hypothalamicnucleithatcontrolbodyweight(Ko

uning,
2012; Morton et al., 2006; Myers et al., 2010; Ryan et al., 2012;
Ka
¨lin et al., 2015). Hypercaloric feeding rapidly induces neuronal
resistance to the actions of leptin, a powerful adipocyte-derived
satiety hormone that maintains normal body weight and euglyce-
mia (Frederich et al., 1995; Ko
¨ nner and Br€
uning, 2012; Morton
et al., 2006; Myers et al., 2010; Ryan et al., 2012). Although the
detailed mechanisms are still unclear, cellular leptin signaling in
the CNS is clearly impaired in rodent models of HFD-induced
obesity (Myers and Olson, 2012; Ryan et al., 2012). Thus, defective
intracellular leptin signaling in the CNS has been proposed as an
underlying cellular mechanism for leptin resistance. Signaling mol-
ecules that directly inhibit leptin signaling, including suppressor of
cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) (Bjørbaek et al., 1998; Howard
et al., 2004; Mori et al., 2004), protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B
(PTP1B) (Bence et al., 2006; Cook and Unger, 2002; Zabolotny
et al., 2002), and T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP)
(Loh etal., 2011),havebeenidentified ascrucial mediatorsofleptin
resistance. All of these factors are upregulated in the hypothala-
mus by HFD-induced obesity (Bjørbaek et al., 1998; Cook and
Unger, 2002; Loh et al., 2011; Zabolotny et al., 2002). Moreover,
neuron-specific deletion of these inhibitors protects against
HFD-induced obesity as well as leptin resistance and insulin resis-
tance(Benceetal.,2006;Howardetal.,2004;Lohetal.,2011;Mori
etal., 2004).Thus, SOCS-3and tyrosinephosphatasescollectively
contribute to the development of HFD-induced obesity. Obesity
induced by HFD is also associated with ER stress and inflamma-
tion in the CNS. Recent studies suggest that HFD-induced ER
stress and inflammation in the CNS impair hypothalamic control
of body weight and glucose balance (Coll et al., 2007; Dietrich
and Horvath, 2013; Morton et al., 2006; Myers and Olson, 2012;
Ryan et al., 2012; Ka
¨lin et al., 2015). Hypothalamic ER stress and
inflammation are markedly increased by overfeeding and in multi-
ple obesity models (De Souza et al., 2005; Ozcan et al., 2009;
Zhang et al., 2008b). Pharmacologic or genetic induction of ER
stress and/or inflammation in the CNS upregulates SOCS-3,
PTP1B, and TCPTP expression and causes leptin resistance and

 obesity (Cakir et al., 2013; Hosoi et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008b).
On the contrary, manipulations that alleviate hypothalamic ER
stress or reduce hypothalamic inflammation ameliorate cellular
leptin resistance and obesity in animals (Kleinridders et al., 2009;
Milanski et al., 2009; Ozcan et al., 2009; Schneeberger et al.,
2013; Zhang et al., 2008b). Although HFD feeding clearly elicits
hypothalamic dysfunction, promoting obesity, the underlying mo-
lecular signaling pathways are poorly understood.
The Ras-like small GTPase Rap1 is a crucial regulator of
multiple cellular processes, including adhesion, polarity, and
proliferation, in non-neuronal cells (Gloerich and Bos, 2011). In
the CNS, Rap1 has diverse roles in an array of neuronal functions
from neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal
polarity to memory and learning (Spilker and Kreutz, 2010). How-

ever, the contributions of CNS Rap1 to en-
ergy balance and glucose homeostasis
are largely unknown. In the present study,
we investigated the role of CNS Rap1 in
the regulation of whole-body energy and
glucose metabolism by producing and
characterizing mice with targeted deletion
of Rap1a and Rap1b, the genes encoding
Rap1, selectively in forebrain neurons.
RESULTS
Loss of Neuronal Rap1 Protects
against Diet-Induced Obesity
We first investigated whether Rap1 is ex-
pressed in the hypothalamus. Consistent
with previous work (Kim et al., 1990; Pan
et al., 2008), quantitative real-time PCR
showed that Rap1a and Rap1b are ex-
pressed in various tissues, including the
CNS, and that both mRNAs are abundant
in the hypothalamus (Figure S1A). We
further examined the hypothalamic distri-
bution of Rap1 by immunohistochemistry
analyses. Rap1 is expressed throughout
the mediobasal hypothalamus, including in multiple nuclei that
regulate whole-body metabolism such as the arcuate (ARC),
ventromedial (VMH), and dorsomedial (DMH) nuclei (Figure S2A;
Figure 1D). We then asked whether CNS Rap1 is activated in
HFD-induced obese mice. As shown in Figure S2B, the active
(guanosine triphosphate [GTP]-bound) form of Rap1 is increased
in the brain of HFD-induced obese mice compared with lean
control mice. Total Rap1 levels were not changed in response
to HFD (Figure 7A). These results and a previous study showing
that Rap1 activity is increased in lean mice after acute HFD
feeding (Fukuda et al., 2011) strongly suggest that Rap1 is
involved in the metabolic responses to HFD feeding.
We thus explored whether CNS Rap1 contributes to diet-
induced obesity and associated metabolic disturbances. To

 produce mice Rap1-null in the forebrain (Rap1DCNS) (Pan et al.,
2008), we crossed double-floxed Rap1a and Rap1b (Rap1)
mice to mice harboring the CaMKIIaCre driver, which express
Cre recombinase in postnatal forebrain neurons in the CNS (Min-
ichiello et al., 1999). We confirmed CNS-specific recombination
of the floxed alleles (Figure 1A), forebrain (including hypothala-
mus) deletion of Rap1 mRNAs (Figure 1B), and selective
depletion of Rap1 protein from forebrain regions, including the
hypothalamus (Figure 1C). Rap1 protein levels were also signifi-
cantly reduced in multiple hypothalamic nuclei (Figure 1D).
Using this Rap1DCNS mouse model, we examined whether
Rap1 has a role in the CNS regulation of energy and glucose
homeostasis in vivo. Male Rap1DCNS and control male mice (the
double-floxed mice of Rap1a and Rap1b) were placed on a HFD
starting at 4 weeks of age to test whether loss of Rap1 protects
against diet-induced obesity. The HFD-fed male Rap1DCNS mice
showed markedly reduced body weight gain (Figure 2A), signifi-

In
contrast,
Rap1DCNS and control male mice fed a
normocaloric chow diet exhibited similar
body weight, adiposity, and serum leptin
levels (Figures 2C, 2G, and 2K). Female
Rap1DCNS mice under HFD feeding also demonstrated lower
body weight and adiposity than female controls (Figures 2B, 2D,
2F, 2H, 2J, and 2L), suggesting no sexual dimorphism in Rap1
function. We used male mice only for subsequent experiments.
We then investigated the basis for the leaner phenotype of
HFD-fed Rap1DCNS mice by directly assessing energy balance
in open-circuit indirect calorimetry cages. Although the body
weight and adiposity of Rap1DCNS mice did not diverge from
control animals after 2 weeks of HFD (Figures S3A and S3B),
Rap1DCNS mice exhibited hypophagia (Figure 2M) associated
with increased hypothalamic expression of anorexigenic neuro-
peptide POMC mRNA and decreased expression of orexigenic
neuropeptide NPY and AgRP mRNAs (Figure 2S; Figure S5B).
In contrast, no difference in energy expenditure (oxygen con-
sumption, carbon dioxide production, locomotor activity, or
thermogenesis) was observed between Rap1DCNS and control
mice (Figures 2N–2Q). Notably, Rap1DCNS mice showed a lower

 respiratory quotient than controls, indicating the preferential use
of fat as an energy source (Figure 2R). Thus, decreased food
intake and preferential oxidation of fat as an energy substrate
likely contributes to decreased adiposity in neuronal Rap1-null
mice under hypercaloric feeding. In chow-fed lean mice, food
intake (Figure S4A), energy expenditure (Figures S4B–S4F),
and mRNA levels of feeding-related hypothalamic neuropep-
tides (Figure S5A) did not differ significantly between genotypes.
These findings suggest that CNS Rap1 plays a crucial role in
mediating diet-induced body weight gain and adiposity.
Improved Glucose Balance and Peripheral Insulin
Sensitivity in Rap1DCNS Mice
Consistent with the leaner body weight phenotype, Rap1DCNS
mice displayed significantly lower levels of blood glucose and
insulin than control animals under HFD feeding (Figures 3A
and 3B), suggesting that mice lacking Rap1 in the CNS have
increased
peripheral
insulin
sensitivity.
Indeed,
HFD-fed
Rap1DCNS mice showed enhanced glucose tolerance (Fig-

higher glucose-tolerant and insulin-sensitive phenotype was

 also observed in age- and weight-matched Rap1DCNS cohorts
maintained on a normocaloric diet (Figures 3E–3H), suggest-
ing that Rap1 deficiency in the CNS influences insulin/glucose
balance regardless of body weight and adiposity. In further
support of improved insulin sensitivity, insulin signaling was
significantly enhanced in the liver, muscle, and fat of HFD-
fed Rap1DCNS mice, as assessed by western blot analyses
using phospho-specific antibodies to Akt and Gsk3b (Fig-
ure 3I), the central mediators of insulin signaling (Manning
and Cantley, 2007). We also observed that hepatic insulin-
dependent phosphorylation of Akt was significantly increased
in normal chow-fed Rap1DCNS mice (Figure S6). In agreement

altered levels of leptin-regulated hypotha-
lamic neuropeptides (Figure 2S). We there-
fore tested whether Rap1 is required for the
development of HFD-induced leptin resis-
tance. Rap1DCNS and control mice were
placed on an HFD (60% fat) for 8 weeks, beginning at 2 months
of age, to induce leptin resistance. We did not observe any
significant difference in body weight (28.02 ± 0.71 g for Control
versus 27.61 ± 0.62 g for Rap1DCNS, n = 8/group, p > 0.05,
t test), fat mass (4.76 ± 0.45 g versus 3.45 ± 0.42 g, n = 8/group,
p > 0.05, t test), or lean mass (20.82 ± 0.44 g versus 21.72 ±
0.31 g, n = 8/group, p > 0.05, t test) between the two groups after
8 weeks of HFD feeding (Figures S3C and S3D), probably
because of the late onset of HFD challenge. Using these age-
and body weight-matched cohorts, we then assessed the
anorectic response to leptin by injecting Rap1DCNS and control
mice with leptin twice daily. Although control mice developed
leptin resistance (Figures 4A and 4B), Rap1DCNS mice responded
to leptin with body weight reduction and suppression of food
intake (Figures 4A and 4B). Further, cellular leptin sensitivity,
as demonstrated by leptin-induced phosphorylation of STAT3,
a marker of activated leptin signaling (Bates et al., 2003; Gao
et al., 2004; Metlakunta et al., 2008; Vaisse et al., 1996), was
significantly enhanced in Rap1DCNS mice but absent in controls
under HFD conditions (Figure 4C). Also, hypothalamic Socs-3
and Tcptp were significantly lower in Rap1DCNS mice than in
controls (Figure 4D). In addition to its effect under an HFD diet,
Rap1 deficiency potently enhanced leptin actions under normal
caloric conditions (Figure S7). Therefore, deletion of CNS Rap1
enhances cellular leptin signaling and protects against leptin
resistance.

 ESI-05 Reverses Leptin Resistance in HFD-Induced
Obesity
To assess the translational value of CNS Rap1, we investigated
the effects of a well-established selective inhibitor of Epac2, ESI-
05 (Rehmann, 2013; Tsalkova et al., 2012). Epac2 is one of the
two members of exchange protein directly activated by cAMP
(Epac) that serves as GTP/guanosine diphosphate (GDP) ex-
change factors for Rap1. Epac2 is predominantly expressed
throughout the brain and in the adrenal gland in humans (Kawa-
saki et al., 1998) and in mice (Figure S1B). We infused leptin, the
selective Epac2 inhibitor ESI-05, or both into the brains of

05 restored leptin sensitivity to a similar
degree in normocaloric-fed lean mice
receiving leptin alone (Figures 5A and 5B). To confirm Rap1
mediation of ESI-05 effects, we repeated these experiments in
Rap1DCNS mice. Consistent with mediation by Rap1, ESI-05
did not enhance leptin sensitivity in Rap1DCNS mice (Figures 5E
and 5F). Next, we investigated whether ESI-05 has this
anti-obesity effect when centrally administered alone to HFD-
induced
hyperleptinemic
and
leptin-resistant

mice.
Central daily infusion of ESI-05 (0.2 nmol/brain/day) significantly
reduced the body weight and food intake of HFD-induced obese
mice (Figures 5G and 5H). In contrast, the body weight of
vehicle-treated control obese mice exhibited no changes during

 the course of the experiment (Figures 5G and 5H). Thus, chronic
administration of ESI-05 alone is indeed able to decrease the
body weight of HFD-induced obese mice (vehicle versus ESI-
05, p < 0.05). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that
Epac2 inhibition reverses leptin resistance and reduces body
weight in HFD-induced obese mice.
Rap1 Is Required to Meditate Leptin Resistance
Conferred by Chemically Induced ER Stress
We next sought to determine potential underlying mechanisms
by which central Epac-Rap1 signaling contributes to leptin
resistance. Cellular leptin resistance can be caused by multiple
mechanisms that include ER stress and hyperleptinemia (Fred-

tential interactions between Epac signaling and putative leptin
resistance-inducing factors. First, we modeled leptin resistance
by treating organotypic brain slices with pharmacological
agents that induce cellular leptin resistance. Similar to previous

leptin-induced
phosphorylation of STAT3 was blocked
by treatment with the ER stress inducers
tunicamycin (TU), thapsigargin, and DTT
(Figures 6A and 6B), whereas leptin stim-
ulated STAT3 phosphorylation in controls (Figures 6A and 6B).
Strikingly, pretreatment with ESI-05, a selective Epac2 inhibitor
(Tsalkova et al., 2012), abolished ER stress-induced leptin
resistance in slices (Figures 6A and 6B). ESI-05 also blocked
cellular leptin resistance induced by forskolin, which activates
Epac-Rap1 signaling (de Rooij et al., 1998; Fukuda et al.,
2011; Figures 6A and 6B). ESI-05 had negligible effects on
leptin resistance resulting from treatment with high-dose leptin
(mimicking hyperleptinemia) (Figures 6A and 6B). ESI-05 alone
did not stimulate leptin-dependent STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig-
ure 6B). To further confirm the effect of ESI-05 in vivo, we
chemically induced ER stress in the brain of lean C57BL/6
mice by the injection of TU. TU treatment increased GTP-
bound (active) Rap1 in the brain (Figure 6C). Inhibition of CNS
Epac2 prevented hypothalamic leptin resistance and Socs-3
induction triggered by centrally injected TU in mice (Figures
6D and 6E), confirming our ex vivo findings. Interestingly, other
key factors involved in leptin resistance, such as negative reg-
ulators of leptin signaling (PTP1B and TCPTP) and a positive
regulator, SHP2 (Zhang et al., 2004), remained unaltered

 (Figure 6E). These findings suggest that Epac2 participates in
ER stress-induced leptin resistance.
Reciprocal Connection between Rap1 and ER Stress in
the CNS under Overnutrition
Because HFD-induced obese mice exhibited both increased CNS
Rap1 activity (Figure 7A; Figure S2B) and ER stress (Ozcan et al.,
2009; Won et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2008b; Figure 7B), we next
investigated whether Rap1 is involved in cellular processes that
mediate HFD-induced ER stress. To test this, we manipulated
CNS Rap1 activity by either pharmacologic inhibition using ESI-
05 or by brain-specific Rap1 deletion (in Rap1DCNS mice). Central
delivery of ESI-05 into the brain of wild-type HFD-induced obese
mice significantly suppressed elevated Rap1 activity in the CNS
(Figure 7A). Treatment with ESI-05 also reversed the increased
expression levels of ER stress marker genes (Xbp1s, Chop and
Atf4) and elevated Il-6 and Socs-3 in the hypothalamus of HFD-
induced obese mice (Figure 7B). In addition, ESI-05 significantly
reduced hypothalamic phosphorylation of the core components
of the unfolded protein response (UPR), PERK, and eIF2a (Walter
and Ron, 2011; Figure 7C). These responses were almost
completely recapitulated in Rap1DCNS mice. We challenged
Rap1DCNS mice and age- and body weight-matched controls
with HFD for 4 weeks and measured hypothalamic expression
levels of ER stress markers and Il-6. After 4 weeks of HFD feeding,
there were no significant differences in body weight and adiposity
between the two groups. Nonetheless, quantitative real-time PCR
revealed significant increases in ER stress markers (Chop, Edem,
Atf4, and Grp94) and pro-inflammatory cytokine Il-6 in the hypo-
thalamus of control mice after HFD challenge, whereas an HFD
failed to upregulate the classical markers of UPR activation and
Il-6 in Rap1DCNS mice (Figure 7D). This suggests that Rap1 defi-
ciency in the CNSprevents HFD induction of ER stress andpro-in-
flammatory cytokine Il-6. In contrast, a reduction in ER stress with
the chemical ER chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA)
(Ozcan et al., 2006) restored Rap1 activity to normal levels and
reduced ERstressmarkers(Figures7Eand7F).Socs-3wasmark-
edly reduced in the hypothalamus of TUDCA-treated (Figure 7G)
and ESI-05-treated (Figure 7B) obese mice. These findings re-
vealed a previously unrecognized mechanistic link between ER
stress and Epac-Rap1 signaling in mediating hypothalamic leptin
resistance.
DISCUSSION
Overnutrition is associated with reduced sensitivity to key
metabolic hormones such as leptin and insulin, and insensi-
tivity to these hormones is fundamental to the pathogenesis
of metabolic disease. Although it is clear that the CNS partic-
ipates in the biological responses to obesogenic conditions,
the detailed neurobiological pathways remain unclear. In this
study, we provide compelling genetic and pharmacological ev-
idence that Rap1 in the CNS acts as a key component of the
mechanistic pathway linking overnutrition to obesity and meta-
bolic disorders. Mice with Rap1 deficiency in the CNS gained
significantly less body weight and adiposity during HFD
feeding compared with HFD-fed control mice and were resis-
tant to HFD-induced systemic glucose imbalance, central lep-
tin resistance, and peripheral insulin resistance. In contrast,
Rap1DCNS mice showed little effect on body weight, energy
expenditure, and hypothalamic regulation of feeding-related
neuropeptides under normocaloric feeding. A specific role for
Rap1 in metabolic dysfunction under a hypercaloric diet is
further supported by current and previous findings that CNS
Rap1 activity in HFD-fed mice is higher than in chow-fed
ones. The decrease in adiposity in HFD-fed Rap1DCNS mice
is likely due to hypophagia without changes in energy expen-
diture because motor activity and thermogenesis were un-
changed. This unaltered energy expenditure in Rap1DCNS
mice compared with controls is in accord with a previous
study reporting that leptin does not actually enhance energy
expenditure in mice but only prevents the decrease associated
with leptin-induced hypophagia (Halaas et al., 1997). Addition-
ally, Rap1DCNS mice have a decreased respiratory quotient,
suggesting a preferential use of fat as an energy source. This
may also contribute to the reduced adiposity gain during
HFD feeding. Consistent with reduced feeding behavior,
Rap1DCNS mice also had reduced mRNA levels of the orexi-
genic neuropeptides AgRP and NPY and increased mRNA
encoding the anorexigenic neuropeptide POMC. As shown in
Figures 1C and 1D, Rap1-expressing cells were retained in
the hypothalamus of Rap1DCNS mice (Rap1afl/fl, Rap1bfl/fl,
CaMKIIa-Cre). This is consistent with previous reports showing
that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIa (CaMKIIa)
expression in the forebrain is almost exclusively restricted to
excitatory,
glutamatergic
neurons
and
absent
from
GABAergic neurons and non-neuronal cells (Liu and Murray,
2012). Thus, Rap1DCNS mice are a partial knockdown model
of CNS Rap1 and could potentially underestimate the role of
CNS Rap1 in controlling metabolism. Collectively, these re-
sults suggest that CNS Rap1 plays a critical role in the devel-
opment of HFD-induced obesity, whereas suppression can
protect against obesity and metabolic disruption by controlling
food intake and maintaining leptin and insulin sensitivity.

 In addition to its effect on energy balance, deletion of Rap1a
and Rap1b from forebrain neurons resulted in markedly
improved glucose tolerance, enhanced systemic insulin sensi-
tivity, and increased cellular insulin signaling in skeletal muscle,
adipose tissue, and liver under HFD feeding. Consistent with
improved hepatic insulin sensitivity, Rap1DCNS mice exhibit
reduced hepatic expression of the key gluconeogenic enzymes
PEPCK and G6pc. Improved systemic glucose balance appears
to occur independently of Rap1 deletion-induced suppression of
body weight and adiposity because age-, body weight- and
adiposity-matched lean Rap1DCNS mice also displayed lower
glucose levels and improved glucose and insulin tolerance under
normocaloric diet feeding. Thus, these data suggest a previously
unrecognized role for neuronal Rap1 in controlling peripheral in-
sulin sensitivity without changes in body weight. The molecular
mechanisms mediating this effect are unclear but could involve
greatly reduced hypothalamic SOCS-3 in neuronal Rap1-defi-
cient mice because selective SOCS-3 deletion in VMH SF1 neu-
rons (Zhang et al., 2008a) or leptin receptor-expressing cells
(Pedroso et al., 2014) improves glucose and insulin tolerance
and enhances peripheral insulin sensitivity without affecting
body
weight.
However,
additional
mechanisms
are
likely
involved because Socs-3 expression alone did not induce
glucose imbalance in mice when expressed in leptin-responsive
neurons (Reed et al., 2010).
The robust effects of forebrain-specific Rap1 deletion are
likely mediated by enhanced hypothalamic sensitivity to leptin.
Rap1DCNS mice fed an HFD have lower serum leptin levels than
HFD-fed control mice, implying enhanced leptin sensitivity. We
further demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of CNS
Rap1 signaling also improves multiple indices of leptin sensi-
tivity and protects mice against development of leptin resis-
tance. Rap1DCNS mice failed to develop resistance to the
anorectic and cellular actions of exogenous leptin under HFD
feeding
conditions.
Notably,
Rap1DCNS
mice
displayed
enhanced leptin actions regardless of diet type, further sup-
porting the primary role of Rap1 in controlling neuronal
leptin sensitivity. Although leptin sensitivity was increased in
Rap1DCNS mice under both normal chow and HFD conditions,
we observed that food intake and preferential oxidation of fat
were only affected in mice under hypercaloric feeding. The
lack of the effects during a normocaloric diet may be due to
the lower concentration of serum leptin levels in chow-fed
mice, which may not be high enough to induce reduced food
intake and increased preferential oxidation of fat even in
Rap1-deficient mice. Remarkably, reduced Rap1 activity in
the CNS, either by genetic deletion or by pharmacologic inhibi-
tion, resulted in suppression of two direct endogenous inhibi-
tors of cellular leptin signaling, SOCS-3 and TCPTP, as well
as inhibitory mechanisms such as inflammatory signals and
UPR
pathways.
Because
these
inhibitors
and
inhibitory
pathways appear to limit cellular leptin signaling under overnu-
trition (Bence et al., 2006; Bjørbaek et al., 1998; Cook and
Unger, 2002; De Souza et al., 2005; Howard et al., 2004; Loh
et al., 2011; Mori et al., 2004; Ozcan et al., 2009; Zabolotny
et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2008b), reductions associated with
Rap1 deficiency likely account, at least in part, for enhanced
leptin sensitivity in Rap1DCNS mice. These results collectively
support our hypothesis that neuronal Rap1 is a major regulator
of leptin sensitivity and acts as a mediator of leptin resistance in
obesity.
One of the most important questions arising from this study
concerns how overnutrition leads to the activation of Rap1 in
the CNS. Rap1 can be activated (converted from the GDP- to
the GTP-bound form) by at least five distinct classes of guanine
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) (Spilker and Kreutz, 2010).
Previous studies reported that the GEFs Epac1 and Epac2
attenuate cellular leptin signaling in cultured cells and brain sli-
ces (Fukuda et al., 2011; Sands et al., 2006). However, the
biological significance of this effect remains controversial
because, although one study showed resistance to diet-
induced obesity in Epac1-null mice (Yan et al., 2013), another
reported augmented diet-induced obesity and glucose imbal-
ance in Epac1 global knockout mice (Kai et al., 2013). In
contrast to these conflicting data on the role of Epac1 in the
control of whole-body energy and glucose balance, our find-
ings suggest that brain Epac2 is likely involved in Rap1 activa-
tion and its effects on hypothalamic functions in HFD-induced
obesity. Interestingly, Rap1 activity is elevated in the brain of
HFD-induced obese mice compared with that of normal chow
fed-lean mice in the absence of changes in the total protein
levels of Rap1 (Figure 7A), Epac1, and Epac2 (Figure S2C), indi-
cating that HFD activation of Epac-Rap1 signaling seems to be
mediated via post-translational modification on Epac. Consid-
ering that Epac is directly activated by cyclic AMP (cAMP),
one implication of this result is that Rap1 could be activated
via G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that act through
either Gs or Gi to modulate the cAMP-Epac pathway (Neves
et al., 2002). Because CNS Rap1 activity is increased by
HFD, it is interesting to speculate that a GPCR ligand is
produced in response to HFD that links overnutrition to Rap1
activation in the CNS. Identification of such a circulating factor
is a critical step for the development of agents that modulate
CNS Rap1, possibly as pharmacological treatment for eating
disorders, obesity, and metabolic diseases.
Our ex vivo studies revealed a previously unidentified link
between Rap1 and ER stress, the relevance of which was
substantiated in vivo. These findings imply that reciprocal inter-
action perpetuates CNS ER stress and Rap1 activation during
overnutrition, subsequently leading to leptin resistance, and
predict that inhibition of Epac-Rap1 signaling breaks this link.
Suppression of CNS ER stress produces anti-obesity benefits
(Hosoi et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015; Ozcan et al., 2009); therefore,
suppression of Epac-Rap1 signaling might also produce benefits
by enhancing leptin sensitivity and improving energy balance.
Our data strongly support this view. Central administration of
ESI-05 to HFD-induced obese mice significantly reversed ER
stress, expression of pro-inflammatory Il-6, and upregulation of
the endogenous leptin inhibitor SOCS-3 in the hypothalamus.
The effect of ESI-05 is sufficiently robust to restore leptin sensi-
tivity to that of healthy lean mice. ESI-05 treatment is associated
with prolonged weight loss maintenance even after treatment
cessation. This distinguishing property of ESI-05 makes it more
attractive as a potential anti-obesity therapy. Although ESI-05
alone showed its effect within a few days after the onset of
treatment (Figures 5G and 5H), an acute anorectic effect was
3012
Cell Reports 16, 3003–3015, September 13, 2016
 only observed with ESI-05 plus a supraphysiological dose of lep-
tin (5 mg). This may be due to differences in the concentration of
leptin in the brain. The cerebrospinal fluid leptin concentration
(<0.5 ng/ml) was reported to be one to two orders of magnitude
lower than serum levels (Schwartz et al., 1996). In addition,
increasing the concentration of exogenous leptin in the brain
causes a dose- and time-dependent decrease in body weight
and food intake (Halaas et al., 1997; Rahmouni et al., 2002).
Therefore, we speculate that the exogenous leptin given to the
brain sensitized by ESI-05 causes a more robust and immediate
reduction in body weight and food intake than endogenous lep-
tin. Nevertheless, it is important to note that ESI-05 alone caused
a body weight reduction in HFD-induced obese mice. Apart from
its action in the brain, Epac2 was reported to be involved in insu-
lin secretion in pancreatic b cells (Song et al., 2013; Zhang et al.,
2009). Further studies will thus need to clarify whether systemic
inhibition
of
Epac2
affects
whole-body
glucose
balance.
Additional evidence that Rap1 is the molecule that mediates
the therapeutic benefit of ESI-05 comes from our experiments
using Rap1DCNS mice. The lack of ESI-05 effects on leptin sensi-
tivity in Rap1DCNS mice strongly suggests that the effect is via
Rap1 and also rules out potential off-target effects of ESI-05.
Most importantly, ESI-05 infusion alone causes weight loss
in diet-induced obese and hyperleptinemic mice, likely by
reversing leptin insensitivity associated with HFD-induced upre-
gulation of SOCS-3. Collectively, these results demonstrate the
potential of ESI-05 as a leptin sensitizer and provide insight
into the promising, translational value of the Rap1 pathway.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mice and Diets
Mice were used for all experiments. C57BL/6 mice were obtained from The
Jackson Laboratory. Rap1aloxp/loxp/Rap1bloxp/loxp mice were provided by
Dr. Alexei Morozov (Pan et al., 2008). All genetically modified mice were
backcrossed to the C57BL/6 (The Jackson Laboratory) background more
than six times. Rap1DCNS mice were generated in the following breeding strat-
egy: double-floxed male mice of Rap1a and Rap1b were crossed to the female
CaMKIIa Cre driver (line 159) (Minichiello et al., 1999). We used only female
CaMKIICre mice to obtain cohorts because CaMKIICre is expressed in the
testis (Figure 1A; Minichiello et al., 1999) and the male germline can produce
offspring that carries the Cre allele in all tissues. From these matings, we pro-
duced mice with deletion of Rap1a and Rap1b in Cre-expressing neurons and
control mice with floxed Rap1a and Rap1b genes. All mice were maintained
under 12:12 hr light-dark cycle conditions and in a temperature-controlled
environment with ad libitum access to water and a normal diet (Pico Lab
5V5R) or high-fat diet (60% kcal fat, Research Diet, D12492). The care of all
animals and procedures conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the NIH and were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of Baylor College of Medicine (AN-6076).
Physiological Measurements
Body weight was measured weekly. Blood samples were collected via the
saphenous vein from 4 hr-fasted mice. Serum blood was isolated after centri-
fugation (5000 3 g for 10 min) at 4�C and stored at –80�C. Blood glucose was
measured by using a One Touch Ultra blood glucose meter. Plasma leptin and
insulin were analyzed with a Milliplex MAP mouse metabolic hormone mag-
netic bead panel kit. Glucose tolerance tests were performed on overnight-
fasted mice. D-glucose (1.5 g/kg) was injected intraperitoneally, and blood
glucose was measured at indicated time points. Insulin tolerance tests were
performed on 4 hr-fasted mice. Insulin (1 U/kg) was injected intraperitoneally,
and blood glucose was measured at indicated time points.
Body Composition and Energy Expenditure Measurements
Whole-body composition was measured using nuclear magnetic resonance
imaging (EchoMRI). Body weight- and body composition-matched 5-week-
old control and Rap1DCNS mice were fed on a high-fat diet. Two weeks later,
metabolic assessment was performed at 7 weeks of age. Mice were first
acclimatized to the metabolic cages and housed individually for 3 days before
measurements were taken. Metabolic parameters, including O2 consumption,
CO2 production, respiratory exchange ratio, heat production, ambulatory ac-
tivity, and food intake, were determined by using the Columbus Instruments
comprehensive lab animal monitoring system (CLAMS).
Leptin Sensitivity Test
Mice were singly housed and acclimatized for 1 week prior to the study.
Body weight- and body composition-matched 15-week-old control and
Rap1DCNS mice were placed on a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. Both groups
were
injected
intraperitoneally
with
vehicle
(Dulbecco’s
PBS
[dPBS],
Sigma-Aldrich, D8537) twice a day (5 p.m. and 9 a.m.) for 4 consecutive
days. Three days after the last vehicle treatment, mice were injected intraper-
itoneally with leptin (3 mg/kg, Harbor-UCLA Research and Education Insti-
tute) twice a day for 6 consecutive days. Food intake and body weight
were measured daily. Similarly, we performed a leptin sensitivity test for
ESI-05 treatment mice. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) surgery was carried
out on mice fed a high-fat diet, and then they were singly housed. One
week after the i.c.v. surgery, the mice were injected with vehicle, leptin
(2 mg/mouse), ESI-05 (0.2 nmol/mouse), or leptin/ESI-05 twice a day. Body
weight and food intake were measured daily.
Organotypic Brain Slice Culture
Hypothalamic slices were made essentially as described before (Fukuda et al.,
2011). Briefly, C57BL/6 mice pups, 8–11 days old, were decapitated, and the
brains were quickly removed. Hypothalamic tissues were blocked and
sectioned in a depth of 250 mm on a vibratome (VT1000S, Leica) in chilled
Gey’s balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) enriched with glucose (0.5%) and
KCl (30 mM). The coronal slices containing the arcuate nucleus were then
placed on Millicell-CM filters (Millipore, pore size 0.4 mm, diameter 30 mm)
and maintained at an air-medium interface in minimum essential media
(Invitrogen) supplemented with heat-inactivated horse serum (25%, Invitro-
gen), glucose (32 mM), and GlutaMAX (2 mM, Invitrogen). Cultures were
typically maintained for 10 days in standard medium, which was replaced
three times a week. After 10 days, the slices were used for experiments.
Cannula Implantation and Treatments
Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and positioned in a stereotaxic frame.
The skull was exposed, and a 26-gauge single stainless steel guide cannula
(C315GS-5-SPC, Plastics One) was implanted into the third cerebral ventricles
(�0.9 mm from the bregma, ± 0.5 mm lateral, �2.5 mm from the skull). The
cannula was secured to the skull with screws and dental cement. After i.c.v.
cannulation, the mice were housed singly and given at least 1 week to recover.
On experimental days, the mice were infused with 1 ml of each solution: vehicle
(dPBS or DMSO), leptin (2 mg/mouse), ESI-05 (0.2 nmol/mouse, Axxora,
BLG-M092-05), leptin/ESI-05, TU (10 mg/mouse, EMD Millipore, 654380),
TU/ESI-05, or TUDCA (2.5 mg/mouse, EMD Millipore, 580549).
Detection of GTP-Rap1 by Rap1 Pull-Down Assay
A Rap1 pull-down assay was performed using the Active Rap1 pull-down
and detection kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendation. After brain samples were dissected out, samples were
snap-frozen and subsequently stored at �80�C. Proteins were extracted
by the provided lysis/wash buffer with protease cocktail inhibitor, and then
lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 3 g for 15 min at 4�C. The protein con-
centration was determined with BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce, 23225)
with BSA as standard. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to affinity
precipitation of GTP-Rap1 by using the Active Rap1 pull-down and detection
kit. The amount of Rap1 was assessed by performing western blotting with
the provided antibody (1:1,000). To assess the levels of total Rap1 or b-actin,
cell extract was directly applied to western blotting without a pull-down
assay.
