ABSTRACT. Objective: The purpose of this study was to outline a 
method to improve alcohol industry compliance with its self-regulatory 
advertising placement guidelines on television with the goal of reducing 
youth exposure to noncompliant advertisements. Method: Data were 
sourced from Nielsen (The Nielsen Company, New Y
ork, NY) for all 
alcohol advertisements on television in the United States for 2005–2012. 
A “no-buy” list, that is a list of cable television programs and networks 
to be avoided when purchasing alcohol advertising, was devised using 
three criteria: avoid placements on programs that were noncompliant in 
the past (serially noncompliant), avoid placements on networks at times 
of day when youth make up a high proportion of the audience (high-risk 
network dayparts), and use a “guardbanded” (or more restrictive) com-
position guideline when placing ads on low-rated programs (low rated). 
Results: Y
outh were exposed to 15.1 billion noncompliant advertising 
impressions from 2005 to 2012, mostly on cable television. Together, the 
three no-buy list criteria accounted for 99% of 12.9 billion noncompli-
ant advertising exposures on cable television for youth ages 2–20 years. 
When we evaluated the no-buy list criteria sequentially and mutually 
exclusively, serially noncompliant ads accounted for 67% of noncompli-
ant exposure, high-risk network-daypart ads accounted for 26%, and low-
rated ads accounted for 7%. Conclusions: These fi
 ndings suggest that 
the prospective use of the no-buy list criteria when purchasing alcohol 
advertising could eliminate most noncompliant advertising exposures 
and could be incorporated into standard post-audit procedures that are 
widely used by the alcohol industry in assessing exposure to television 
advertising. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 77, 7–16, 2016)

E
XCESSIVE ALCOHOL USE is a risk factor for the 
three leading causes of death among adolescents: un-
intentional injuries, homicide, and suicide (Miniño, 2010). 
Alcohol use during adolescence has also been found to 
increase the risk of alcohol dependence during adulthood 
(Grant & Dawson, 1997). Furthermore, according to the 
2013 Y
outh Risk Behavior Survey, approximately one in 
fi
 ve high school students in the United States (21%) reports 
heavy episodic drinking, defi
 ned in the Y
outh Risk Behavior 
Survey as the consumption of fi
 ve or more drinks in a row or 
within 2 hours (Kann et al., 2014). Adolescents who report 
heavy episodic drinking are also at higher risk for drinking 
and driving, violence and personal injury, dating violence or 
rape, and using other drugs (Miller et al., 2007).
 
Many individual factors infl
 uence adolescent initiation 
and use of alcohol, including age; gender; race/ethnicity; 
drinking by parents and other caregivers; drinking by peers; 
presence of older siblings in the home; personality character-
istics, such as sensation seeking and rebelliousness; affective 
disorders, such as anxiety and depression; cultural factors, 
such as religiosity; environmental factors, such as alcohol 
policies; and developmental factors, such as cognitive devel-
opment (Donovan, 2004; Masten et al., 2009; Naimi et al., 
2013; Windle et al., 2009). However, even after controlling 
for these factors, research studies have found that exposure 
to alcohol advertising increases the risk that adolescents will 
initiate alcohol use, and that those who drink will do so more 
frequently and at higher intensity, thereby increasing the risk 
of alcohol-attributable harms (e.g., injuries) (Anderson et al., 
2009; Grenard et al., 2013; Smith & Foxcroft, 2009).
Alcohol advertising and underage drinking
 
Alcohol advertising infl
 uences youth drinking by associat-
ing alcohol use with desirable attributes (e.g., attractiveness, 
sexual prowess, or masculinity) and by associating alcohol 
use with enjoyable activities (e.g., parties, celebrations, 
sports, and recreation) (Austin & Hust, 2005). Researchers 
have found that advertisements that tell a story, use humor, 
or include animals are particularly attractive to youth (Chen 
et al., 2005). Consistent with social cognitive theory (Ban-
dura, 1986, 1994), many studies have found that alcohol ad-
vertising changes attitudes toward alcohol, promotes positive 
expectancies of alcohol use, and increases both intentions to 
drink and subsequent drinking behavior (Austin et al., 2006; 
Bekman et al., 2011; Dal Cin et al., 2009; Fleming et al., 
2004; Morgenstern et al., 2011; Nicolai et al., 2012; Stacy 
et al., 1990).

In addition, the music, videography, and pacing of al-
coholic beverage ads have been found to infl
 uence early 
phases of adolescents’ alcohol decision-making process by 
increasing the desirability of alcohol, increasing the realism 
of drinking situations portrayed in the ads, and increasing the 
underage viewer’s desire to emulate the portrayals (Pinkleton 
et al., 2001). Alcohol advertising portrayals linking drinking 
with risky activities (e.g., motorcycle racing, skiing, and 
snowboarding) have also been associated with increased 
tolerance for risky behaviors, including driving after drinking 
(Zwarun et al., 2006).
 
Anderson and colleagues (2009) and Smith and Foxcroft 
(2009) have summarized in review articles longitudinal re-
search studies focused on the association between different 
forms of alcohol marketing and underage drinking behavior. 
Stacy and colleagues (2004), Collins and colleagues (2007), 
and Morgenstern and colleagues (2011) specifi
 cally exam-
ined the association between televised alcohol advertising 
and underage drinking. Stacy and colleagues used a variety 
of opportunity-based measures—including reported fre-
quency of watching televised sports, frequency of watching 
other television programs popular with youth that contained 
alcohol advertising, and recalled frequency of seeing alcohol 
advertisements on television—to assess youth exposure to 
alcohol advertising. They found that each of these measures 
was associated with an increase in beer drinking among 
middle school students.
 
Collins and colleagues (2007) used an approach similar to 
that of Stacy and colleagues (2004) to assess youth exposure 
to alcohol advertising and found that exposure to alcohol 
advertisements on sports television was associated with an 
increase in beer drinking. In addition, Morgenstern and col-
leagues found that youth exposure to and recall of televised 
alcohol advertising had both a direct and a mediated effect 
on drinking and heavy episodic drinking. In this study, re-
spondents were required to identify masked alcohol ads and 
report the frequency with which they had seen the ads. This 
advertising exposure was associated with current and heavy 
episodic drinking, both directly and through a mediated re-
lationship with changes in attitudes and expectations toward 
drinking.
 
Critics of these longitudinal studies have suggested that 
the researchers have not adequately controlled for potential 
confounding factors that could explain all or part of the 
reported association between alcohol advertising and under-
age drinking (Nelson, 2010). However, these studies actually 
controlled for a large number of confounding factors, includ-
ing parental and peer drinking; family coherence; religiosity; 
trait factors, such as deviance or impulsivity; demographic 
factors, including the age, sex, and race/ethnicity of study 
subjects; and environmental factors, such as participation in 
extracurricular activities and school attachment. It is possible 
that these studies did not account for additional confounding 
factors that were uncorrelated with covariates controlled for 
in the analysis, but such factors have not been identifi
 ed. 
Thus, the published evidence suggests that, independent of 
other explanatory factors, exposure to alcohol advertising 
can increase the likelihood that youth will start drinking and 
will drink more if already drinking (Anderson et al., 2009). 
Given advertising’s infl
 uence on youth drinking behavior, 
regulation of advertising is a key concern of alcohol market-
ers, public health offi
 cials, parents, and families.
Regulation of alcohol advertising in the United States
 
In their landmark 2003 report to Congress on reducing 
underage drinking, the National Research Council and Insti-
tute of Medicine made reducing youth exposure to alcohol 
advertising a key recommendation (Bonnie & O’Connell, 
2004). The principal means of limiting underage exposure to 
alcohol advertising in the United States is through a series of 
self-regulatory marketing guidelines produced by the alcohol 
advertisers themselves (Evans & Kelly, 1999; Evans et al., 
2003, 2008, 2014). Trade associations for producers of dis-
tilled spirits (Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, 
2011a), beer (The Beer Institute, 2011), and wine (The Wine 
Institute, 2011) have each produced a code of voluntary 
practices to guide advertising and marketing activities. These 
codes provide trade association members with guidelines on 
advertising content and placement. The intent of the place-
ment guidelines is to limit underage exposure to advertising 
without limiting advertising to legal-age adults.
 
Since September 2003, advertising placement guidelines 
for all three alcohol trade associations have specifi
 ed that alco-
hol advertisements be placed only in media in which the adult 
audience is proportionate to the U.S. adult population. From 
September 2003 to May 2011, this guideline translated into a 
minimum adult (ages 21 years and older) audience proportion 
of 70% (Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, 2011b; 
The Beer Institute, 2011; The Wine Institute, 2011). In June 
2011, each trade association increased this minimum adult 
audience proportion to 71.6% to adjust for the 2010 census. 
The advertising codes are silent about the maximum underage 
audience (ages younger than 21 years), but by default, these 
adult limits translate into maximum underage audiences of 
30% before June 2011 and 28.4% thereafter.
 
Because television audiences may vary from one telecast 
to the next, industry guidelines suggest using a 6-month 
average audience composition for a network program (if 
available), or a network–daypart combination to verify that 
the audience complies with the guidelines before placing an 
advertisement. The distilled spirits industry code (which it 
states applies to all categories of alcoholic beverages for its 
members) also advises advertisers to conduct semi-annual, 
after-the-fact audits on a random sample of ad placements 
to verify that they met compliance guidelines, and to take 
corrective action if noncompliant placements are found 
(Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, 2011b).

Previous recommendations of the Federal Trade 
Commission
 
In its 1999 review of the advertising practices of the 
alcohol industry, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) rec-
ommended that alcohol advertisers adopt “no-buy” lists of 
media that were likely to generate disproportionate underage 
exposure (Evans & Kelly, 1999). The no-buy list was cited 
once again as a best practice in the FTC’s 2003 report, not-
ing that several makers of fl
 avored malt beverages (i.e., “al-
copops,” such as Mike’s Hard Lemonade and Smirnoff Ice) 
maintained a no-buy list of television networks that included 
MTV and UPN, and television programs such as Malcolm in 
the Middle, Gilmore Girls, and Boston Public (Evans et al. 
2003). Both the 2008 and 2014 FTC reports noted the use of 
no-buy lists by alcohol advertisers when advertising place-
ments in certain media were found to be out of compliance 
(Evans et al., 2008, 2014).
Aims of this study
 
The objective of this study was to outline a public health 
intervention—a no-buy list—that would reduce youth expo-
sure to alcohol advertising within the current self-regulatory 
advertising environment. To develop the no-buy list inter-
vention, we conducted a complete, after-the-fact audit of 
alcohol advertising on television to assess compliance with 
the alcohol industry’s self-regulatory audience composition 
guidelines from 2005 to 2012, and to assess the proportion 
of total underage exposure to alcohol advertising that re-
sulted from ads placed on television programming that did 
not meet these guidelines (i.e., noncompliant advertising). 
The audit began in 2005 rather than 2003 to give alcohol ad-
vertisers time to adjust to the new purchasing standards and 
to allow for the fact that decisions regarding the placement 
of alcohol advertising may be made a year in advance of the 
date when the advertising is telecast. We set out to determine 
(a) the percentage of alcohol advertisements and percent-
age of underage alcohol advertising exposure derived from 
noncompliant advertisements; (b) the criteria that could be 
used to create a no-buy list for television alcohol advertising, 
and the parameters to be applied to set these criteria; and 
(c) the incremental impact of applying each of these no-buy 
list criteria on underage exposure to noncompliant alcohol 
advertising on cable television.
Method
Data source
 
Television advertising data for the years 2005–2012 were 
licensed from Nielsen (The Nielsen Company, New Y
ork, 
NY) for all alcoholic beverage types in Nielsen’
s alcohol cat-
egory (beer, distilled spirits, alcopops or sweetened alcoholic 
beverages that taste like soda pop and contain malt-based al-
cohol, and wine). The details of our methods for processing 
and analyzing Nielsen data have been reported previously 
(Center on Alcohol Marketing and Y
outh, 2010). Briefl
 y, oc-
currence and audience data were downloaded from Nielsen 
Monitor-Plus; coded to classify advertisements as product, 
“responsibility,” or other types of advertisements; standard-
ized regarding brand names and alcohol types according 
to Impact Databank, a leading alcohol industry marketing 
research fi
 rm; and organized into a Microsoft SQL*SERVER 
database (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). This study 
used data on 2,461,999 alcohol product advertisements on 
network, cable, and local television from 2005 through 2012, 
with a particular focus on 1,452,661 (59% of the total) cable 
television advertisements.
Measures
 
An advertising impression is a measure of exposure repre-
senting a single advertisement seen by a single viewer within 
a demographic group. Gross impressions are the sum of all 
advertising impressions, including multiple impressions seen 
by individuals. In this article, we will use the term impres-
sions to represent gross impressions. On television, under-
age audience composition was defi
 ned as the proportion of 
underage viewers ages 2–20 years as a percentage of the 
total viewing audience ages 2 years and older (age 2 years is 
the youngest age reported in the Nielsen audience survey). 
A compliant advertisement was defi
 ned as an advertisement 
that was placed on a television program that complied with 
the alcohol industry’s self-regulatory placement guidelines 
(i.e., 30% or less of the viewing audience was underage 
from January 2005 through September 2011, and 28.4% or 
less of the viewing audience was underage thereafter). A 
noncompliant advertisement was defi
 ned as an advertisement 
that was placed on a television program that did not comply 
with the alcohol industry’s self-regulatory placement guide-
lines. Noncompliant exposure was defi
 ned as the number of 
advertising impressions seen by youth ages 2–20 years as a 
result of noncompliant advertisements.
Analysis
 
Compliance assessment. Noncompliance was measured 
by calculating the proportion of advertisements and underage 
impressions generated by noncompliant advertisements. This 
noncompliance was assessed as a percentage of all alcohol 
advertising exposures (impressions) among persons ages 2 
years or older (the method used by the FTC in its most re-
cent report; Evans et al., 2014), and as a percentage of total 
advertising impressions among viewers ages 2–20 years. To 
determine which media type (cable network, spot or “local 
broadcast,” or broadcast network television) accounted for 
 10 
JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS / JANUARY 2016
the majority of noncompliant exposure, we calculated non-
compliant exposure by media type and by year (2005–2012).
Creation of a no-buy list. We proposed the creation of a 
no-buy list using a series of three sequential and mutually 
exclusive ad purchasing restrictions that we shall refer to 
as no-buy list criteria. We describe these criteria in the next 
sections.
 
Serially noncompliant placements. First, we examined ad-
vertisements placed on programs that were noncompliant in 
the previous year. Because alcohol companies are supposed 
to audit their performance relative to their placement guide-
lines (Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, 2011b), 
it should be possible to avoid repeatedly placing advertising 
on programs that have been found to be noncompliant in 
the past. We refer to advertising placements on programs 
that were found to be noncompliant in the previous year as 
“serially noncompliant” placements.
 
High-risk network dayparts. Next, for the remaining 
noncompliant advertisements that were not found to be seri-
ally noncompliant, we examined whether the advertisements 
were placed on certain networks during times of the day (or 
“dayparts”) that were more likely to have disproportionately 
large youth audiences. This is an important consideration 
because advertisers often cannot specify that advertisements 
be placed on specifi
 c cable television programs and must 
instead purchase ads to run in certain network dayparts, or at 
any time on a network (so-called run-of-station or run-of-site 
advertising). Therefore, it is important to assess the impact 
of eliminating alcohol advertising on specifi
 c network day-
parts when there is a high risk of noncompliance. After we 
excluded advertising that appeared on serially noncompliant 
programs, 90% of the remaining noncompliant advertising 
from 2005 to 2012 resulted from ads that were placed on 145 
cable network dayparts. These 145 “high-risk network day-
parts” accounted for 11.4% of the 1,272 total cable network 
dayparts on which alcohol advertising was placed during this 
period.
 
Low-rated cable television programs. Finally, we exam-
ined how many of the remaining noncompliant advertise-
ments—that is, advertisements that were neither serially 
noncompliant nor placed on high-risk network dayparts—
appeared on low-rated cable television programs. Programs 
with low ratings have smaller audiences, and consequently 
the demographic characteristics (e.g., age distribution) of the 
viewers of these programs are likely to be less stable than 
for more highly rated programs with larger audiences due to 
measurement uncertainty.
 
Defi
 nition of low-rated cable television program. Low-
rated cable television programs were defi
 ned using televi-
sion audience measurements by Nielsen, which are based 
on a nationally representative sample of households. Spe-
cifi
 cally, we used Nielsen data to calculate the coeffi
 cient 
of variation of the adult audience rating for all programs 
that ran alcohol advertisements from 2005 through 2012. 
This coeffi
 cient was calculated by dividing the standard de-
viation of all adult (age 21 and older) audience ratings for 
alcohol advertisements placed on cable television by the 
mean of all adult audience ratings on cable television. We 
then compared the coeffi
 cient of variation above and below 
adult audience rating thresholds of 1.5, 1.25, 1.0, 0.75, 
0.50, and 0.25 to fi
 nd a threshold where the coeffi
 cient of 
variation above the threshold was small relative to the coef-
fi
 cient of variation below the threshold (i.e., the threshold 
below which adult audience composition estimates became 
unstable).
 
We found that alcohol ads on cable television with an 
adult audience rating of 0.50 or less (which equates to ap-
proximately 1,000,000 or fewer adult viewers) had a coeffi
 -
cient of variation of 92.2, whereas the coeffi
 cient of variation 
for programs with an adult audience rating above 0.50 was 
68.8. By contrast, the coeffi
 cient of variation for ads with an 
adult audience rating of 0.25 or less (83.2) was almost iden-
tical to programs with a rating above this threshold (80.2). 
Therefore, an adult audience rating of 0.50 represented the 
smallest threshold we tested in which there was consider-
ably more fl
 uctuation in adult audience ratings below the 
threshold compared with above the threshold. Based on this 
analysis, we classifi
 ed alcohol ads placed on cable television 
programs with an adult audience rating below 0.50 as place-
ments on “low-rated” programs.
 
Assessing the impact of a no-buy list. To assess the impact 
of the three no-buy list criteria on reducing youth exposure 
from noncompliant ad placements, we calculated total un-
derage exposure to alcohol advertising on cable television 
programs as well as the estimated reduction in noncompliant 
advertising exposure on these programs that could have been 
achieved by sequentially applying each of the three, mutu-
ally exclusive, no-buy list criteria: eliminating placement on 
serially noncompliant cable television programs; eliminating 
advertising during high-risk network dayparts; and fi
 nally, 
eliminating alcohol advertising on low-rated cable television 
programs. The potential reduction in noncompliant exposure 
was assessed for 2006–2012 rather than 2005–2012 because 
we needed to refer to placements in the prior year to classify 
noncompliant advertisements.
 
Guardbanding alcohol advertisements on low-rated cable 
programs. With the proliferation of networks and programs 
on cable television, audiences for many cable programs may 
be relatively small. Therefore, it may not be feasible for alco-
hol advertisers to simply eliminate advertising on low-rated 
cable television programs because this would severely limit 
the programming available for placement of their advertise-
ments. We therefore assessed the potential impact on non-
compliant advertising of using a more restrictive underage 
audience composition limit for low-rated cable television 
programs—a technique called “guardbanding” (Shector, 
1992). This approach has also been recently endorsed by the 
FTC. Specifi
 cally, the FTC has recommended that “if lack of 
  
ROSS, BREWER, AND JERNIGAN 
11
compliance is due to wide fl
 uctuations in measured audience 
composition due to small sample size, the [alcohol] company 
should consider using a higher [adult] audience threshold 
at the time of the placement to maximize the likelihood of 
post-placement compliance with the 71.6 percent audience 
composition standard” (Evans et al., 2014, Executive Sum-
mary, page iii).
 
To follow the FTC’s recommendation, alcohol companies 
would need to assess how much higher the adult audience 
composition must be (or how much lower the underage 
audience composition must be) to reliably meet their goals. 
Therefore, we evaluated the potential impact of various 
underage audience composition limits on noncompliant ex-
posure the following year. To do so, we fi
 rst calculated the 
average underage composition of low-rated cable television 
programs (i.e., programs with an adult rating of 0.50 or less) 
that ran alcohol advertising between 2005 and 2011. We then 
calculated the percentage of noncompliant advertisements 
that aired on that same television program in the following 
year (i.e., from 2006 through 2012). We then plotted the 
average underage composition in the prior year against the 
percentage of noncompliant advertisements in the following 
year and recommended a guardband range in a region of the 
resulting response curve that was relatively fl
 at, providing 
protection against higher proportions of noncompliant ads 
due to fl
 uctuations in the percentage of the viewing audience 
that was underage.
Results
Noncompliant alcohol advertising and advertising 
impressions
 
All television. From 2005 through 2012, the alcohol in-
dustry spent $7.5 billion placing 2,461,999 advertisements 
on television, of which 190,255 (7.7%) were telecast on 
programs that exceeded the alcohol industry’s underage 
composition guidelines (i.e., were noncompliant) (Table 1). 
Beginning in 2007, the majority of noncompliant ad place-
ments have been on cable television.
 
A total of 42.9 billion (4.7%) of the 913.8 billion alcohol 
advertising impressions viewed by all persons ages 2 years 
or older (i.e., by underage youth and legal-age adults) on all 
television programs from 2005 through 2012 were due to 
noncompliant advertising (Table 2). In contrast, 15.2 billion 
(11.6%) of the 131.5 billion alcohol advertising impres-
sions viewed by persons ages 2–20 years on all television 
programs from 2005 through 2012 were generated by non-
compliant advertisements.
 
Cable television. Of the 42.9 billion total noncompli-
ant alcohol advertising impressions viewed by all persons 
ages 2 years or older, 40.7 billion (95.0%) aired on cable 
television programs (Table 2). Similarly, of the 15.2 billion 
total noncompliant alcohol advertising impressions viewed

JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS / JANUARY 2016
by persons ages 2–20 years from 2005 through 2012, 14.4 
billion (94.6%) resulted from the 118,636 noncompliant 
advertisements that aired on cable television programs. We 
therefore focused the balance of our analyses on noncom-
pliant alcohol advertisements and advertising impressions 
viewed by persons ages 2–20 years on cable television.
Noncompliant alcohol advertising on no-buy list cable 
programs
Serially noncompliant programs. On cable television, 
more than half (55.8%) of the noncompliant advertisements 
viewed by persons ages 2–20 years from 2006 through 2012 
were placed on serially noncompliant programs. These seri-
ally noncompliant ads accounted for 67.4% of all noncom-
pliant exposure among viewers ages 2–20 years (Table 3).
 
High-risk network dayparts. After accounting for serially 
noncompliant placements, we found that total advertise-
ments placed on high-risk network dayparts independently 
accounted for 30.2% of all noncompliant advertisements and 
25.5% of all noncompliant exposure among viewers ages 
2–20 years from 2006 to 2012 (Table 3).
 
Low-rated cable programs. After accounting for advertise-
ments on serially noncompliant programs and on high-risk 
network dayparts, we found that advertisements placed on 
low-rated cable television programs accounted for 13.9% of 
all noncompliant advertisements and 6.5% of all noncompli-
ant exposure among viewers ages 2–20 years from 2006 to 
2012 (Table 3). Taken together, advertisers could therefore 
eliminate the vast majority of noncompliant alcohol adver-
tising exposure on cable television programs using a no-buy 
list based on these three purchasing criteria.
Guardbanding low-rated cable television programs
 
The effect of guardbanding low-rated programs on youth 
exposure to alcohol advertising is shown in Figure 1. Al-
cohol ads placed on low-rated programs with an average 
underage composition of at least 25% but less than 30% in 
a baseline year (the current alcohol industry standard) aver-
aged close to 30% noncompliant placements in the follow-
ing year, whereas ads placed on programs with an average 
underage composition of at least 30% but less than 35% (the 
prior alcohol industry standard) averaged more than 60% 
noncompliant placements in the following year. By contrast, 
alcohol ads placed using a guardbanded limit of 20% were 
associated with less than 10% noncompliant placements in 
the following year.

Discussion
 
Underage youth were exposed to more than 15 billion 
noncompliant alcohol advertising impressions from 2005 
through 2012, and almost all of these noncompliant im-
pressions (96%) resulted from advertisements that aired on 
cable television programs. Furthermore, almost all of the 
noncompliant alcohol advertising exposures on cable televi-
sion programs (99.4%) aired on programs that were either 
known to have previously violated the alcohol industry’s 
placement standards (i.e., were serially noncompliant), ran 
during periods that were known to be popular among under-
age youth (i.e., high-risk network dayparts), or were known 
to have a small number of adult viewers (i.e., low rated). 
Based on these fi
 ndings, if the alcohol industry chose not to 
purchase alcohol advertising using these no-buy list criteria, 
youth could have been protected from viewing as many as 
14 billion alcohol advertising impressions that were found to 
be noncompliant with industry standards during this 8-year 
period.
 
Our fi
 nding that most noncompliant alcohol advertising 
was placed on cable television programs is consistent with 
fi
 ndings from other studies that have assessed youth expo-
sure to alcohol advertising on television (Center on Alcohol 
Marketing and Y
outh, 2010). One recent study found that 
alcohol advertising exposure for underage youth ages 18–20 
years was growing faster than that for any other age group 
and that this growth in exposure was attributable to the 
growth in alcohol advertising on cable television (Ross et al., 
2014). Another study examining youth exposure to alcohol 
advertising in local television markets found a signifi
 cant 
rise in exposure attributable to the increase in cable televi-
sion advertising (Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion, 2013).
Implications for alcohol advertisers
 
Two thirds of noncompliant alcohol advertising expo-
sures resulted from the placement of alcohol advertising on 
programs that were found to have noncompliant advertising 
in the previous year, and that another 1 of 4 noncompliant 
advertising exposures resulted from the placement of alcohol 
advertising on programs that aired during times of the day 
when underage youth were most likely to be watching (i.e., 
during high-risk network dayparts). Furthermore, after tak-
ing these previous two criteria into account, we found that 
almost the entire remaining balance of noncompliant expo-
sure was attributable to advertising placements on low-rated 
FIGURE 1. Percentage of alcohol advertisements on low-rated cable television programs that exceeded the youth audience composition threshold during 
2006–2012 based on the prior-year underage audience composition of purchased alcohol advertising. A “low-rated” program has an age 21 and older audi-
ence of fewer than 1,000,000 viewers (a rating of 0.50). A guardbanded audience composition limit is a lower audience composition threshold that is used to 
account for measurement variation so that the published specifi
 cation is achieved.

JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS / JANUARY 2016
programs. Taken together, these fi
 ndings suggest that the 
prospective use of the no-buy list criteria when purchasing 
alcohol advertising is feasible and could be incorporated 
into standard post-audit procedures that are widely used 
by the alcohol industry in assessing exposure to television 
advertising.
 
Our fi
 ndings also suggest that guardbanding the underage 
audience composition limit on low-rated cable television pro-
grams by lowering the underage audience composition limit 
from between 25% and 30% to between 15% and 20% could 
reduce the expected proportion of noncompliant exposure 
the following year by about two thirds (from an estimated 
30% noncompliance to 10% noncompliance, respectively). 
This suggests that it is still possible to signifi
 cantly reduce 
noncompliant alcohol advertising exposure on low-rated 
programs without entirely eliminating alcohol advertising on 
these programs, and thus contribute to the expected reduc-
tion in noncompliant advertising that could be achieved by 
implementing other no-buy list strategies, including eliminat-
ing advertising on serially noncompliant programs and on 
high-risk network dayparts.
Feasibility of no-buy list intervention
 
The proposed no-buy list, comprising the criteria out-
lined above, remedies virtually all noncompliant underage 
exposure. However, for it to be a viable intervention, the 
no-buy list must be implemented easily and cost-effectively. 
Companies should already be auditing their advertising 
placements to assess compliance and identify serially non-
compliant programs or high-risk network dayparts. Thus, the 
intervention should not add a procedural burden. Nor should 
the intervention impose an excessive fi
 nancial burden. A 
very small fraction of all cable television programs account 
for serially noncompliant advertising, and only 145 network 
dayparts of more than 1,200 account for almost all noncom-
pliant advertising. Therefore, the cost to the advertiser to 
move out of these media should be minimal.
 
We are at a loss to explain why no-buy lists such as those 
proposed in this study are not used extensively. Research 
published nearly a decade ago estimated the short-term cash 
value of underage drinking to the alcohol industry at $22.5 
billion in 2001 (Foster et al., 2006); however, there is no evi-
dence that alcohol companies intentionally generate under-
age exposure to their advertising. It is possible that there is 
general complacency about the level of compliance already 
achieved. In its reviews of self-regulatory performance, the 
FTC has noted high levels of compliance (Evans et al., 2008, 
2014). However, with more than 14 billion noncompliant 
underage advertising impressions occurring during the study 
period, there is room for improvement. There may also be 
a perception that measurement error in audience estimates 
makes achieving higher levels of compliance unobtainable. 
However, we have shown that using a guardbanded composi-
tion limit addresses the uncertainty in measuring audiences 
for television programs with lower ratings.
 
Future research should monitor adoption of these no-buy 
lists and assess any reduction in underage exposure from 
noncompliant advertising as well as the impact of any reduc-
tions in youth exposure on underage drinking outcomes.
 
Limitations of this study include our reliance on Nielsen’s 
television audience sampling methodology, which produces 
audience composition estimates with a high degree of vari-
ability for low-rated programs. However, these are the same 
data that are used by the alcohol industry to plan, execute, 
and monitor its advertising schedules, and thus represent the 
“gold standard” by which performance should be measured. 
Another limitation is the amount of overlap between our no-
buy list criteria: most serially noncompliant advertisements 
are also found on high-risk network dayparts, and many 
of these same advertisements are on low-rated programs. 
However, these criteria were applied sequentially to inde-
pendently assess their impact on reducing noncompliant 
advertisings. In addition, the ordering of these no-buy list 
criteria aligns with the alcohol industry’s current recom-
mendations for conducting post-audits to assess compliance 
with self-regulatory guidelines on the placement of alcohol 
advertising and thus provides an appropriate basis for plan-
ning corrective measures. Furthermore, companies should 
already be identifying advertising placements that violate 
industry standards and taking corrective actions. Thus, it 
makes sense to assess compliance with no-buy list criteria 
in the order presented.
 
In summary, this study shows that the use of no-buy list 
criteria by alcohol advertisers could have eliminated youth 
exposure to as many as 14 billion noncompliant alcohol ad-
vertising impressions on cable television from 2005 to 2012. 
Although eliminating these 14 billion noncompliant alcohol 
advertising exposures is an important step toward reduc-
ing total youth exposure to alcohol advertising, advertising 
research has found that responses to advertising stimuli are 
nonlinear; consequently, lower levels of exposure to alcohol 
advertising can generate a greater response (e.g., greater 
likelihood of youth initiating alcohol use) on a per-exposure 
basis than higher levels of exposure (Ackoff & Emshoff, 
1975; Rao & Miller, 1975; Ross et al., 2014; Wind & Sharp, 
2009). Consistent with this fi
 nding, the National Research 
Council/Institute of Medicine and the attorneys general of 
24 U.S. states and territories (Bonnie & O’Connell, 2004; 
Shurtleff et al., 2011) have recommended limiting the 
placement of alcohol advertising to media where youth 
ages 12–20 years are no more than 15% of the audience. 
Previous research has shown that this proposed threshold is 
economically feasible, does not limit the ability of alcohol 
companies to advertise to legal-age adults, and could reduce 
youth exposure to alcohol advertising by as much as 20% 
(Jernigan et al., 2005), thus further reducing the risk of un-
derage drinking and the harms related to it. Nonetheless, our 
  
ROSS, BREWER, AND JERNIGAN 
15
study shows that reducing noncompliant alcohol advertise-
ments on cable television is an appropriate and achievable 
public health objective that would reduce exposure to this 
risk factor for underage drinking and, thus, complement 
evidence-based strategies for reducing underage and heavy 
episodic drinking that are currently recommended by the 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Community 
Preventive Services Task Force, including increasing alcohol 
taxes and regulating alcohol outlet density (Campbell et al., 
2009; Elder et al., 2010).
