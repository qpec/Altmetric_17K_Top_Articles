 Physician Reimbursement in Medicare Advantage Compared
With Traditional Medicare and Commercial Health Insurance
Erin Trish, PhD; Paul Ginsburg, PhD; Laura Gascue, MS; Geoffrey Joyce, PhD
IMPORTANCE Nearly one-third of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare
Advantage (MA) plan, yet little is known about the prices that MA plans pay for physician
services. Medicare Advantage insurers typically also sell commercial plans, and the extent to
which MA physician reimbursement reflects traditional Medicare (TM) rates vs negotiated
commercial prices is unclear.
OBJECTIVE To compare prices paid for physician and other health care services in MA,
traditional Medicare, and commercial plans.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective analysis of claims data evaluating MA
prices paid to physicians and for laboratory services and durable medical equipment between
2007 and 2012 in 348 US core-based statistical areas. The study population included all MA
and commercial enrollees with a large national health insurer operating in both markets, as
well as a 20% sample of TM beneficiaries.
EXPOSURES Enrollment in an MA plan.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mean reimbursement paid to physicians, laboratories, and
durable medical equipment suppliers for MA and commercial enrollees relative to TM rates
for 11 Healthcare Common Procedure Coding Systems (HCPCS) codes spanning 7 sites of care.
RESULTS The sample consisted of 144 million claims. Physician reimbursement in MA was
more strongly tied to TM rates than commercial prices, although MA plans tended to pay
physicians less than TM. For a mid-level office visit with an established patient (Current
Procedural Terminology [CPT] code 99213), the mean MA price was 96.9% (95% CI,
96.7%-97.2%) of TM. Across the common physician services we evaluated, mean MA
reimbursement ranged from 91.3% of TM for cataract removal in an ambulatory surgery
center (CPT 66984; 95% CI, 90.7%-91.9%) to 102.3% of TM for complex evaluation and
management of a patient in the emergency department (CPT 99285; 95% CI,
102.1%-102.6%). However, for laboratory services and durable medical equipment, where
commercial prices are lower than TM rates, MA plans take advantage of these lower
commercial prices, ranging from 67.4% for a walker (HCPCS code E0143; 95% CI,
66.3%-68.5%) to 75.8% for a complete blood cell count (CPT 85025; 95% CI, 75.0%-76.6%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Traditional Medicare’
s administratively set rates act as a
strong anchor for physician reimbursement in the MA market, although MA plans succeed in
negotiating lower prices for other health care services for which TM overpays. Reforms that
transition the Medicare program toward some premium support models could substantially
affect how physicians and other clinicians are paid.

here is considerable variation in the negotiated prices
that private health insurers pay to clinicians for treat-
ingcommerciallyinsuredpatientsintheUnitedStates.1-5
Unlikecommercialpayers,Medicarereimbursesphysiciansand
other clinicians according to an administratively set fee sched-
ule. However, nearly one-third of Medicare beneficiaries are
covered by private insurers through the Medicare Advantage
(MA) program,6 and less is known about how these private MA
plans reimburse clinicians. On the one hand, we may expect
clinicianreimbursementinMAtobesimilartotraditionalMedi-
care’
s administratively set rates because the amount that the
federal government pays MA plans to provide insurance cov-
erageforMAenrolleesislargelybasedonlocaltraditionalMedi-
care spending levels. However, these same insurers negotiate
prices with clinicians for their commercial enrollees that dif-
fer from traditional Medicare and reflect market forces, so it
is possible that these same market dynamics could affect the
MA market. In addition to understanding how clinicians are
being paid for care of a large and growing share of Medicare
beneficiaries, empirical evidence on clinician reimburse-
ment in MA is also important for evaluating the potential im-
pactofproposedMedicarereformsthatwouldtransitionMedi-
care to be increasingly reliant on private plans,7 including the
impact that such reforms might have on clinician payment.
Several recent studies have shown that MA plans pay hos-
pitals at rates that are similar to or slightly less than those of
traditional Medicare8-12; however, there is little empirical evi-
dence outside the hospital setting. We present data on MA re-
imbursement for physician services, laboratory tests, and
durable medical equipment from a retrospective analysis of
claims data from 2007 through 2012.
Methods
Data Sources
WeanalyzedclaimsdataforMAandcommercialenrolleesfrom
a large national insurer operating in both markets from 2007
through 2012. In 2012, the insurer held 17% of nationwide MA
market share and offered 1 or more MA plans in 98% of coun-
ties, in which 94% of Medicare beneficiaries lived. The data
include the full set of adjudicated and paid claims for all en-
rollees; enrollment increased from 1.7 million in 2007 to 2.6
million in 2012.
We measured traditional Medicare rates from a 20% ran-
domsampleofMedicarebeneficiariesthroughadatauseagree-
mentwiththeCentersforMedicare&MedicaidServices(CMS).
The study was considered exempt by the institutional review
board of the University of Southern California. Data were
deidentified.
Sample and Procedure Selection
We restricted our analysis to patients enrolled for the entire
calendar year, either with the private insurer in the MA and
commercial plans or in traditional Medicare. We restricted our
sample to those enrolled in managed care plans by excluding
enrollment in the private insurer’
s indemnity and private fee-
for-service (MA) plans. We selected a subset of procedures
(identified by the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding
System [HCPCS] codes) that represented high total expendi-
tures and/or claim volume and spanned different types of cli-
nicians and health care services (eg, primary care physicians,
specialist physicians, laboratory services) and multiple places
of service (eg, physician’
s office, hospital inpatient and out-
patient, ambulatory surgery center [ASC], independent labo-
ratories). Additional detail on the selected procedures is pro-
vided in the Table. While we examined a wide range of services
in our analysis, for brevity we present results for these 11 pro-
cedure codes spanning 7 sites of care. However, the results are
substantively unchanged when a broader set of services is
examined.
Study Variables and Analysis
We constructed measures of the mean price for each service
within geographic markets, defined by core-based statistical
areas(CBSAs)includingthemetropolitandivisionstherein.The
CBSA is a geographic area defined by the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget to represent an area with commuting ties to
anurbancenter.The11largestCBSAs(eg,greaterNewYorkCity,
greater Chicago) are separated into smaller Metropolitan
Divisions (eg, 4 Divisions within New York City, 3 Divisions
within Chicago), and so we use the smaller Metropolitan Di-
vision codes, when applicable, to define the geographic mar-
kets within these larger CBSAs. The private insurer’
s data in-
clude the geographic location of the health care facility at the
3-digitzipcodelevel.Weaggregated3-digitzipcodestoCBSAs;
because our zip code to CBSA crosswalk is at the 5-digit code
level, we exclude underlying data from 3-digit zip codes with
ambiguous CBSA classification. Specifically, we retain claims
onlyfrom3-digitzipcodeswhosepopulationcleanlymapsinto
1CBSAforatleast70%ofthepopulationinthat3-digitzipcode.
We evaluated what is commonly referred to as the
“allowed amount”—that is, the contracted rate that the plan
agreed to pay the clinician for the service, after any contrac-
tual discounts. This reflects the total payment made to the cli-
nician or health care facility by both the insurer and the pa-
Key Points
Question How does physician reimbursement in Medicare
Advantage compare with traditional Medicare’
s rates and
commercial health insurance rates?
Findings In this analysis of 144 million claims for common services
from 2007 to 2012, physician reimbursement in Medicare
Advantage was more strongly tied to traditional Medicare rates
than to negotiated commercial prices, although Medicare
Advantage plans tended to pay physicians less than traditional
Medicare. However, Medicare Advantage plans take advantage of
the commercial market’
s favorable pricing for services for which
traditional Medicare overpays, including laboratory tests and
durable medical equipment.
Meaning Traditional Medicare’
s administratively set rates act as
an anchor for physician reimbursement in the Medicare Advantage
market. Reforms that would transition the Medicare program
toward premium support models that end traditional Medicare
could affect how clinicians are paid.

 tient (in the form of cost-sharing). We excluded claims with
modifier codes that reflect different levels of reimbursement
and selected claims with the main unit of measure for the spe-
cific procedure. For example, we excluded claims paid (pri-
marily by health maintenance organizations) using monthly
units, which likely represent capitated payments. This re-
sulted in excluding 26% of claims for our selected proce-
dures,mostofwhichwereclaimsforphysicianofficevisitsand
laboratory tests.
Wecomputedthemeanpriceforeachservice,byplantype,
place of service, CBSA, and year. We then calculated the mean
priceforeachserviceasapercentofthemeantraditionalMedi-
care rate for that same service within each CBSA, separately
for MA and commercial patients. We then averaged these rela-
tive mean prices across CBSAs within each year, weighting by
the private insurer’
s enrollment in the given CBSA and line of
business. The private insurer has a broader presence in the MA
market than the commercial market, which means that we ob-
serve MA data in CBSAs where we do not observe adequate
commercial data. Because this analysis is primarily focused on
MA prices, we did not want to exclude the MA data from these
CBSAs without commercial data; however, constructing com-
mon weights to aggregate across CBSAs would, by definition,
impose assumptions about commercial prices in the CBSAs
where these data do not exist. We therefore present data using
uniqueweightsforMAandcommercialplans,representingthe
insurer’
s MA and commercial presence across CBSAs, respec-
tively.However,thatlimitstheabilitytocomparerelativeprices
(relative to traditional Medicare) across the MA and commer-
cial markets because they represent different underlying geo-
graphic markets. We present additional results for MA using
data only from those CBSAs that also have a commercial pres-
ence and common weights in eFigures 1 to 4 in the Supple-
ment. Using these alternative weights, the general findings are
substantively unchanged.
We excluded claims with zero or negative payment
amounts (1.8% of claims) and with prices more than 4 stan-
dard deviations above or below the mean (by payer) as outli-
ers (0.4% of claims). Where we report a single price measure

 sures across years, giving equal weight to each year. All analy-
ses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc)
and Stata (version 14; StataCorp) software.
Results
From 2007 through 2012, there were a total of 15.0 million
claims for MA enrollees, 120.7 million claims for traditional
Medicare enrollees, and 8.5 million claims for commercial en-
rollees included in our study. More detail on each of the pro-
cedures, including the mean traditional Medicare reimburse-
ment,thedegreeofvariationinreimbursement(withinCBSAs)
by plan type, and the number of claims and markets included
in our study is available in the Table. For a given service, tra-
ditional Medicare reimbursement varies little across physi-
cians within a market, whereas commercial prices vary con-
siderably.Thereislesswithin-marketvariationinMAphysician
reimbursementthancommercial,butsomewhatmorethantra-
ditional Medicare. In contrast, MA reimbursement varies more
than commercial for some laboratory services and durable
medical equipment (see Table).
The mean markup over traditional Medicare rates for MA
and commercial enrollees is displayed for each physician pro-
cedure in Figure 1. Physician reimbursement in MA was simi-
lar to or slightly less than traditional Medicare rates. For the
most common physician service in our data—a standard mid-
level office visit with an established patient (Current Proce-
duralTerminology[CPT]99213)—themeanMApricewas96.9%
(95% CI, 96.7%-97.2%) of traditional Medicare. Across the phy-
sician services in Figure 1, mean MA reimbursement ranged
from 91.3% of traditional Medicare for cataract removal in an
ASC (CPT code 66984; 95% CI, 90.7%-91.9%) to 100.2% of
traditional Medicare for the professional fee for interpreta-
tion of a computed tomographic scan in an emergency depart-
ment (CPT 70450[26]; 95% CI, 100.0%-100.4%).
Moreover, for these physician services, there was consid-
erably less variation in mean MA reimbursement (relative to
traditional Medicare) across markets compared with commer-
cial reimbursement (eAppendix and eTable in the Supple-
ment). Taken together, these data suggest that traditional
Medicare rates tend to represent a strong anchor for physi-
cian reimbursement in MA.
In contrast, physician reimbursement for commercial en-
rollees was higher than under traditional Medicare. The com-
mercial markup over traditional Medicare varied across both
type of service (ie, across HCPCS codes) and, for some ser-
vices, across place of service within a given procedure. For a
standard office visit (CPT 99213), the mean physician reim-
bursement for commercial patients was 107.2% (95% CI,
106.1%-108.3%) of traditional Medicare. Consistent with other
work,13 commercial markups tended to be higher for proce-
dures performed by specialists than for evaluation and man-
agement services, which suggests that specialist physicians
have stronger negotiating power with insurers than primary
care physicians. Additionally, we found higher physician re-
imbursement for the professional fee (ie, excluding the facil-
ity fee) for colonoscopies (CPT 45385) and cataract removals
(CPT 66984) when performed in hospital outpatient depart-
ments (HOPDs) compared with ASCs (for colonoscopy, 152.4%
[95% CI, 143.1%-161.7%] in HOPD vs 129.1% [95% CI, 122.8%-
135.4%] in ASC; for cataract removal, 125.0% [95% CI, 119.5%-
130.5%] in HOPD vs 107.1% [95% CI, 103.7%-110.5%] in ASC);
traditional Medicare reimbursement for the professional fee
for these procedures does not vary across these sites of care.

 ting may reflect the fact that hospitals tend to have stronger
bargaining clout to negotiate the professional fees for the phy-
sicians who are employed by them compared with the inde-
pendent practices that tend to perform procedures in ASCs.
Whereas commercial prices tend to be higher than those
of traditional Medicare, there are several services for which
commercial prices are actually lower, including tests per-
formedinindependentlaboratoriesanddurablemedicalequip-
ment. We found that commercial reimbursement is lower than
traditional Medicare for these services and that MA plans take
advantage of these lower commercial prices. The mean rela-
tive prices for 3 common types of durable medical equip-
ment—afacemaskusedwithacontinuouspositiveairwaypres-
sure device (HCPCS A7030), a walker (HCPCS E0143), and an
oxygenconcentrator(HCPCSE1390)—aredisplayedinFigure2.
The mean commercial price ranges from 70.5% (walker; 95%
CI, 68.9%-72.2%) to 72.8% (oxygen concentrator; 95% CI,
71.8%-73.7%) of traditional Medicare. In each case, the MA re-
imbursement is similar to these commercial prices—that is, be-
low traditional Medicare. While the gap in pricing has likely
narrowed recently due to Medicare implementing a competi-
tive bidding program for durable medical equipment,14 these
findings suggest that private insurers had already been cor-
recting for Medicare’
s overpayments.
Commercial reimbursement for laboratory testing varies
substantially depending on the place of service, whereas tra-
ditional Medicare’
s rates did not vary across place of service
during the study period. For a complete blood cell count (CPT
85025), the mean commercial prices were 114.5% (95% CI,
112.1%-116.9%) and 70.4% (95% CI, 69.4%-71.3%) of tradi-
tional Medicare when billed by a physician’
s office and an
independent laboratory, respectively. In the physician’
s of-
fice setting, where commercial plans paid more than tradi-
tional Medicare, mean MA reimbursement was similar to the
traditional Medicare rate (93.9%; 95% CI, 93.3%-94.4%). In the
independent laboratory setting, where commercial plans paid
less than traditional Medicare, MA plans also paid these below-
Medicare prices (75.8% for MA; 95% CI, 75.0%-76.6%; 70.4%
for commercial; 95% CI, 69.4%-71.3%).
Changes over time in mean physician reimbursement for
an office visit (CPT 99213) for enrollees in different plan types
are displayed in Figure 3. The mean traditional Medicare rate
increased 17.6% over the study period, from $56.60 (95% CI,
$56.15-$57.05) in 2007 to $66.58 (95% CI, $66.24-$66.93) in
2012; however, this increase was nonlinear over the study pe-
riod, with considerable increases in 2010 and 2011, largely due
to Medicare policy changes intended to increase payments for
primary care services.15-17 While mean reimbursement varies
across market segments, the patterns in reimbursement in-
creases are similar, suggesting that traditional Medicare rates,
and Medicare policies that affect these rates, have an impor-
tant influence on price negotiations between insurers and cli-
nicians or health care institutions for enrollees in MA and com-
mercial plans. In addition, Figure 3 indicates that physician
reimbursement for office visits was lower for MA health main-
tenance organization enrollees compared with MA preferred
provider organization enrollees, although the differential nar-
rowed over the study period.

 amounted to a mean of 102.3% (95% CI, 102.1%-102.6%) of that
of traditional Medicare over the study period and was rela-
tively stable. In contrast, the mean markup of commercial
prices over traditional Medicare increased from 222.1% (95%
CI, 209.3%-235.0%) in 2007 to 306.2% (95% CI, 292.5%-
319.8%) in 2012. Whereas the commercial markup over tradi-
tional Medicare did increase over the study period for several
otherproceduresthatweevaluated,therateofincreaseofthese
commercial prices for emergency visits was an important out-
lier, which may reflect the substantial consolidation among
emergency-based physician practices that has occurred in re-
cent years.18 However, the contrast between the substantial
price increases in the commercial market compared with the
relative stability in the MA market also suggests that MA mar-
ket dynamics are able to constrain the impact of such consoli-
dation of health care professionals whereas commercial mar-
kets face the brunt of its implications.
Discussion
From 2007 through 2012, physician reimbursement in MA was
more strongly tied to traditional Medicare rates than negoti-
ated commercial prices, although MA plans tended to pay phy-
sicians less than traditional Medicare rates. This finding is con-
sistent with prior research in the hospital setting.8-12 However,
we found that MA plans tend to benefit from the commercial
market’
s favorable pricing for a few select services for which
traditional Medicare overpays. Our findings, taken together
with prior work, suggest that traditional Medicare rates tend
to represent a strong anchor for MA clinician reimbursement
formostphysicianandhospitalservicesbutthatMAplanstake
advantage of commercial plans’leverage where traditional
Medicare is overpaying for services.19-21 Several recent pay-
ment reforms in the traditional Medicare program have
attempted to address these overpayments, including CMS’
s
recent implementation of a competitive bidding program for
durable medical equipment14 and a policy scheduled to take
effect in 2018 changing Medicare reimbursement for labora-
tory tests to be lower in independent laboratories than in phy-
sicians’offices.22 Whereas these policy changes represent
improvements to CMS’
s payment formulas, the fact that MA
plans have been benefitting from favorable pricing for these
services back to at least 2007 suggests that private MA health
insurers have been able to take advantage of the private mar-
ket’
s correction for these traditional Medicare pricing failures
for many years. However, laboratory services and durable
medical equipment represent a small fraction of total Medi-
care spending (<3% in 2016 combined)23,24; thus, for physi-
cian and hospital services, which constitute most of Medi-
care spending, MA plans tend to pay clinicians near traditional
Medicare rates.
Limitations
Our findings have some important limitations. First, the MA
and commercial data included in our study are only from 1 in-
surer and therefore may not necessarily be representative of
the experience of other private insurers or of geographic lo-
cations not served by this particular insurer. However, the in-
surer has a large presence in the MA market and thus the find-
ings are reflective of common pricing patterns in the MA
market. In addition, we were unable to assess payment to
health care professionals under capitated arrangements due
to data limitations, so the extent to which our findings reflect
clinician payment in capitated settings is unclear. We were also
unable to link clinicians across the private insurer’
s claims data
andthetraditionalMedicareclaimsdata,sowecouldnotevalu-
ate the extent to which reimbursement differences across mar-
ket segments could reflect a different distribution or network
of health care institutions serving MA and traditional Medi-
care patients. For example, in an analysis of MA payment rates
to hospitals, Baker et al10 found that accounting for the differ-
ences in the networks of hospitals treating MA patients nar-
rowed the differences in MA and traditional Medicare pay-
ments by approximately 30%. We are unable to make such
adjustments with our data, which may suggest that our find-
ings overstate any differences in MA physician reimburse-
ment compared with traditional Medicare. However, there is
less variation in the traditional Medicare fee schedule for a
given physician service within a local geographic market than
thereisforagivenhospitalizationacrosshospitalswithinamar-
ket, and thus adjusting for these network differences would
likely make less of a difference for physician reimbursement
compared with hospitals. We were also unable to assess the
extent to which differences in mean prices may reflect other
clinician-level factors, such as quality, and whether there were
any differences across payers outside of direct reimburse-
ment, such as pay-for-performance bonuses or penalties.
There are several likely explanations for our main finding
that MA clinician reimbursement is more strongly tied to tra-
ditional Medicare than to the insurer’
s negotiated commer-
cial prices, particularly for physician services. Consistent with
previous expositions,8,12,25 we believe that the main drivers of

 this are (1) the fact that CMS payments to MA plans are largely
based on spending in the traditional Medicare program and (2)
the existence of regulations substantially restricting balance
billing of MA patients who undergo treatment by out-of-
network clinicians. Regarding the former, traditional Medi-
care rates likely provide a strong anchor on price negotiations
between MA plans and clinicians because, in the extreme, if
clinicians or health care institutions were to charge prices that
are considerably higher than traditional Medicare rates while
payments to MA plans are based on formulas tied to tradi-
tional Medicare spending (and thus rates), then insurers would
likely abandon MA and enrollees would return back to the tra-
ditional Medicare program in which clinicians would be paid
attraditionalMedicarerates.Thus,attemptsbyhealthcarepro-
fessionals to charge substantial markups over traditional
Medicare rates (such as at commercial prices) would likely be
a strategy with only short-term viability.
Another important policy constraining MA clinician prices
to traditional Medicare rates is the existence of a Medicare
statute26,27 and implementing regulation28 that limit the abil-
ity of clinicians participating in the traditional Medicare pro-
gram to bill out-of-network MA enrollees at higher than tra-
ditional Medicare rates. Specifically, even if a clinician chooses
not to participate in an MA plan’
s network but provides care
to an MA enrollee as an out-of-network provider, they cannot
charge that MA patient more than traditional Medicare’
s rate
for that service. If the physician is “nonparticipating” in the
traditional Medicare program, meaning that he or she does not
agreetoacceptMedicareratesaspaymentinfull,thenthatphy-
sician is allowed to balance bill patients, but with limits on this
balance billing, resulting in total payment that is 109.25% of
the traditional Medicare rate. (Few physicians who treat Medi-
care patients are nonparticipating.) These restrictions limit
clinician bargaining leverage in negotiations with MA plans,
particularly for services that commonly occur out-of-
networksuchasemergencyservices,becausecliniciansarenot
able to charge substantially higher prices for services deliv-
ered out-of-network, which mitigates the price incentive for
the clinician to stay out-of-network and thus increases the
insurer’
s bargaining power vis-à-vis the clinician.
The contrast between the markup over traditional Medi-
care for commercial and MA prices, particularly for physician
services in the emergency department, and the substantial in-
crease in this commercial markup over the study period sug-
geststhatthistypeofregulationlimitingbalancebillingforout-
of-network services could potentially provide an important
restraintonclinicianmarketpowerinthecommercialmarket.29
Several policy proposals have been implemented and/or put
forth to regulate balance billing in the commercial market for
clinicians and health care services that patients do not choose,
often referred to as “surprise medical billing.”30,31 For ser-
vices such as emergency department visits, in which a large
proportionofbillingcouldbeaffectedbysuchpolicies,thefind-
ings from our analysis suggest that this could also constrain
clinician prices for in-network contracting, as seen in MA.
Broader billing limits could affect the negotiated prices for
many more services, but we do not perceive this to be on the
policy agenda at this point.
Finally, our analysis suggests that Medicare payment poli-
cies play a strong role in negotiations for many physician ser-
vices in the broader market, as both MA and commercial prices
for physician office visits increased concurrent to CMS poli-
cies increasing Medicare payments for these services (as seen
in Figure 3). This finding is consistent with prior research,
which found that major Medicare payment policy changes in
the 1990s affected reimbursement in the commercial mar-
ket, particularly for office visits.32 Our findings suggest that
traditional Medicare rates continue to be a prominent anchor
forpricenegotiationsforphysicianservicesand,moreover,that
this is true for both the commercial and MA markets.
This finding has important implications for policy propos-
als related to transitioning traditional Medicare to a premium
support model. Sometimes referred to as a defined contribu-
tion or voucher approach, premium support involves the fed-
eral government providing a payment on behalf of each Medi-
carebeneficiarytowardthepurchaseofahealthinsuranceplan.
Such proposals generally aim to reduce growth in Medicare
spending by relying on both increased competition among in-
surers providing privatized Medicare benefits (such as MA)
and incentivizing beneficiaries to choose lower-cost plans.33
Although the details of such proposed reforms vary, generally
speaking, the traditional Medicare program would likely have
reduced enrollment—or cease to exist entirely. Our findings re-
inforce prior modeling assumptions made by the Congressio-
nal Budget Office,25 suggesting that this transition could have
important implications for clinician prices in both the MA and
commercial markets. That is, it is unclear what, if anything,
would anchor clinician price negotiations absent the presence
of traditional Medicare’
s rates, but it is likely that the dissolu-
tion of traditional Medicare would result in increased clini-
cian prices paid by private plans serving Medicare beneficia-
ries—although projections of the fiscal impact of such a
development would discourage such a policy change. To the
extentthatthetraditionalMedicareprogramcontinuesbutwith
reduced market share, it may still restrain clinician pricing de-
mands on MA plans.12 Like today, higher prices than tradi-
tional Medicare would shift enrollment back to that program.
In addition, restrictions on balance billing in Medicare and MA
wouldlimitpricingdemands.However,theseconstraintswould
disappear if the traditional program were abolished.
Conclusions
Physician reimbursement in MA is more strongly tied to tra-
ditionalMedicarethantocommercialprices,butMAplanstake

traditional Medicare overpays. Commercial markups over tra-
ditional Medicare vary across physician services, with strik-
ing increases in these markups for emergency department
visits in recent years. Traditional Medicare’
s administratively
set rates, and the statutes and implementing regulations that
limit billing out-of-network MA enrollees above these rates,
play an important role in influencing clinician reimburse-
ment in MA. Current policy proposals that would substan-

 tioning to a premium support model, would have broad
implications for clinician reimbursement and thus the afford-
ability of such a reformed Medicare program. In addition,
implementing regulations limiting the amount that clinicians
can bill for out-of-network enrollees in the commercial
market, as currently exist in MA, may help to provide some
check on clinician market power and constrain commercial
markups, particularly in the emergency department setting.

Invited Commentary
HEALTH CARE REFORM
Medicare Advantage Reimbursement to Physicians
James C. Robinson, PhD
The most annoying aspect of the public discourse on
physician payment is the tone of victimization. Physicians
complain that insurers have consolidated and are under-
paying them relative to the
value they generate. Insurers
complain that clinicians
and health care institutions
have consolidated and are demanding unaffordable rates.
This is uninspiring. Can some new light be shed in the
darkness?
It can. In their article on physician payment rates for pro-
cedures provided to patients covered by commercial insur-
ance, private Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, and public tra-
ditional Medicare (TM) insurance, Trish et al1 report that MA
payment rates track those in TM closely but fall meaningfully
below those paid by commercial insurance. This might be
unremarkable except that the data reflect rates paid for the
same Current Procedural Terminology codes in the same local
markets by the same private health plan, which sponsors
coverage for both commercial and MA enrollees.
Wait a minute. Are we saying that this large for-profit
insurer is able to pay physicians approximately at TM rates for
its MA members but then chooses to pay those same physi-
cians 10% to 50% more for its commercial members? What
aboutitsdutytomaximizeprofitsforshareholders?Arewesay-
ingthatphysicianshavethebargainingpower(presumablydue
to consolidating with hospitals) to charge rates 10% to 50%
above TM for commercially insured patients but then acqui-
esce to TM rates for their MA patients? Since when do physi-
cians gift their bargaining leverage to insurers?
Is there a method to this madness?
There is no real method to the madness of the US health
care system. The system is absurd. Nevertheless, the find-
ings of Trish et al1 shed light on the dynamics of market com-
petitionthatmightbeofutilityifsomeoneeverwishestomake
the system slightly less so.
First, physicians do have bargaining leverage with insur-
ers. Trust me, if the health plan studied here could pay phy-
sicians at TM rates for their commercial as well as their MA
patients, they would. Consolidation works, especially when
physicians combine with hospitals that are protected from
competition through mergers, acquisitions, and regulatory
barriers to entry.
Second, TM does stiffen the back of MA plans. The MA
plans are paid by Medicare on a per-beneficiary basis
pegged to TM per-beneficiary costs. These depend, in turn,
on the TM payment rates mandated by the governmental
program. Medicare Advantage plans cannot pay physicians
at rates much above the TM benchmark or they will lose
money, which would be a violation of their mandate. Ulti-
mately, the insurers are required to make a take-it-or-
leave-it offer to physicians, limiting MA payment rates to
the TM level regardless of the clinicians’consolidation and
potential bargaining leverage. Some physicians accept those
rates and some do not. The facts on the ground say that
enough clinicians accept TM rates for MA patients to ensure
the growth of the MA program.
Why do physicians do this? Maybe they love Medicare
and will work long hours for low pay to care for elderly
patients, without complaining about stingy government
bureaucrats and greedy corporate executives. Or maybe
physicians are willing to accept low payment rates for MA
patients in exchange for an expectation of high payment
rates for commercially insured patients.
Why do insurers do this? Why do they pay high rates to
physicians for treating their commercial members when
they can pay low rates for treatment of their MA members?
Why do the insurers not just focus on MA and let the com-
mercial members go, if payment rates for the latter are so
high? There is a lot of room still to grow in MA, which still
covers less than half of the Medicare population.
To grow their MA enrollment, insurers need to have
physicians willing to treat them. Although we must never
assume rationality in health care economics, it is possible that
physicians consider their entire book of business, commer-
cial and MA, and join the insurer’
s network if the net revenue
from the entire book is attractive. In this view, insurers sub-
sidize the growth of their MA networks by paying high rates
for commercial patients.
Where high payments are not necessary to induce clini-
cians to participate in MA, insurers do not provide them. As
reported by Trish et al,1 MA plans are able to negotiate com-
mercial payment rates for some services, such as clinical
laboratory tests and durable medical equipment, that are
lower than the rates paid by TM. (To understand why TM
pays such high rates to these nonphysician providers, ask
