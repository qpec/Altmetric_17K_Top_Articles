Summary
Background Antibiotic use in human medicine, veterinary medicine, and agriculture has been linked to the rise of 
antibiotic resistance globally. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarise the effect that interventions 
to reduce antibiotic use in food-producing animals have on the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in animals 
and in humans.
Methods On July 14, 2016, we searched electronic databases (Agricola, AGRIS, BIOSIS Previews, CAB Abstracts, 
MEDLINE, Embase, Global Index Medicus, ProQuest Dissertations, Science Citation Index) and the grey literature. 
The search was updated on Jan 27, 2017. Inclusion criteria were original studies that reported on interventions to 
reduce antibiotic use in food-producing animals and compared presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria between 
intervention and comparator groups in animals or in human beings. We extracted data from included studies and did 
meta-analyses using random effects models. The main outcome assessed was the risk difference in the proportion of 
antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
Findings A total of 181 studies met inclusion criteria. Of these, 179 (99%) described antibiotic resistance outcomes in 
animals, and 81 (45%) of these studies were included in the meta-analysis. 21 studies described antibiotic resistance 
outcomes in humans, and 13 (62%) of these studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled absolute risk 
reduction of the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in animals with interventions that restricted antibiotic use 
commonly ranged between 10 and 15% (total range 0–39), depending on the antibiotic class, sample type, and bacteria 
under assessment. Similarly, in the human studies, the pooled prevalence of antibiotic resistance reported was 
24% lower in the intervention groups compared with control groups, with a stronger association seen for humans 
with direct contact with food-producing animals.
Interpretation Interventions that restrict antibiotic use in food-producing animals are associated with a reduction in 
the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in these animals. A smaller body of evidence suggests a similar association 
in the studied human populations, particularly those with direct exposure to food-producing animals. The implications 
for the general human population are less clear, given the low number of studies. The overall findings have directly 
informed the development of WHO guidelines on the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals.

Introduction
Infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria result in 
increased mortality, morbidity, and social and economic 
costs.1–4 By 2050, an estimated 10 million deaths per year 
globally will be attributable to antimicrobial resistance, 
with a cumulative economic cost of US$100 trillion.5 
Governments around the world have mobilised to address 
this pressing public health concern at the recent 
G20 Summit and the meeting of the UN General 
Assembly.6,7 Further, WHO has created a set of strategies to 
combat rising antibiotic resistance, which include 
improving sanitation and hygiene to reduce overall 
infection rates, and optimising the use (and preventing the 
overuse) of antibiotics in both humans and animals.8
There is increasing recognition that widespread 
antibiotic use in agriculture and aquaculture might 
contribute to the development of resistance to antibiotics 
commonly used in human medicine,9–11 especially given

the overlap of antibiotics used for these different 
purposes.10,12–14 For example, bacteria in animals that are 
treated with antibiotics can develop antibiotic resistance, 
and these bacteria, which might carry resistance genes, 
can then be transmitted from animals to humans.15 This 
cross-species transmission can occur through food, direct 
contact between humans and animals, or shared 
environmental sources such as contaminated water.15
There is currently no consensus regarding the effect that 
antibiotic use in food-producing animals has on antibiotic 
resistance in the human population. Furthermore, the 
effect of interventions that restrict antibiotics in food-
producing animals on antibiotic resistance in both animals 
and humans is somewhat unclear. Despite this evidence 
gap, many countries (particularly in the European Union) 
have made substantial efforts to reduce the overall use of 
antibiotics in food-producing animals, through the 
creation of national reduction targets, implementation of 
mandatory bans of antimicrobial drugs in the feed of food-
producing animals, benchmarking antibiotic use at the 
farm level, and encouraging antibiotic stewardship such as 
by requiring susceptibility testing before the use of some 
high-priority antibiotics.16 Though it is plausible that such 
interventions will result in lower antibiotic resistance in 
animals, the environment, and in human beings, sound 
evidence is required to shape global policies regarding 
antibiotic use in the food animal industry.
We were commissioned by the WHO Advisory Group on 
Integrated Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance (WHO 
AGISAR) to do a systematic review and meta-analysis, to 
inform the development of WHO guidelines on the use of 
antibiotics in food-producing animals. The objective of our 
systematic review was to assess whether a restriction of 
antibiotic use in food-producing animals (specifically 
within the classifications of avian, swine, bovine, caprine, 
camel, equine, rabbit, ovine, fish, bees, molluscs, and 
crustaceans) reduces the presence of antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria in food-producing animals and in human beings.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
We did this systematic review and meta-analysis using a 
predetermined protocol and in accordance with PRISMA 
reporting standards.17 On July 14, 2016, we identified 
potentially relevant articles by searching Agricola, 
AGRIS, BIOSIS Previews, CAB Abstracts, MEDLINE, 
Embase, Global Index Medicus ProQuest Dissertations, 
and Science Citation Index. No limits were placed based 
on publication date. We updated the literature search on 
Jan 27, 2017
.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Rising rates of antimicrobial resistance are a significant global 
concern. The widespread use of antibiotics in human beings 
and animals contributes to this problem. Antibiotics used in 
food-producing animals are closely related to those used in 
human medicine and can select for resistance in these animals. 
Cross-species transmission of resistant bacteria or resistant 
genetic elements from animals to humans can and does occur. 
As a result, many jurisdictions have implemented restrictions 
on the use of antibiotics in agriculture, in an effort to combat 
rising antibiotic resistance in humans. It is unclear, however, 
whether these restrictions are effective. There are a large 
number of original studies exploring effects of such 
interventions on antibiotic resistance. However, these studies 
have not yet been fully systematically reviewed or 
meta-analysed, nor have they been thoroughly explored to 
understand the heterogeneity of findings.
Added value of this study
We have done a large-scale systematic review of the global 
literature, seeking to fully summarise and distil existing 
knowledge. To our knowledge, this is the first review to 
comprehensively examine the associations between 
interventions that restrict antibiotic use in food-producing 
animals and antibiotic resistance in both animals and humans. 
We searched electronic databases (Agricola, AGRIS, BIOSIS 
Previews, CAB Abstracts, MEDLINE, Embase, Global Index 
Medicus, ProQuest Dissertations, Science Citation Index) and 
grey literature on July 14, 2016, with an update on Jan 27, 2017. 
Any interventions that aimed to reduce antibiotic use in 
food-producing animals (including but not limited to measures 
to improve antimicrobial stewardship, setting national 
antibiotic reduction targets, mandatory or voluntary bans, and 
antibiotic-free farming systems) were considered. We found a 
large body of literature (179 eligible studies, 81 of which were 
included in the meta-analysis) showing that interventions that 
reduce antibiotic use in food-producing animals are associated 
with a reduction in prevalence of antibiotic resistance in these 
animals. Our findings also suggest a similar association of 
reduced antibiotic resistance in human beings (21 studies, 
13 of which were included in the meta-analysis), particularly 
those in direct contact with food-producing animals.
Implications of all available evidence
These findings are informative in the development of 
forthcoming guidelines from different sectors such as 
governmental bodies and WHO. Reducing antibiotic use in 
agriculture is associated with reductions in antibiotic resistance 
in food-producing animals. At minimum, the benefit appears to 
extend to farmers and those in direct contact with 
food-producing animals. The evidence of benefit for the general 
human population is less clear, but has potential for broad-
reaching effects. The wide implementation of strategies to 
reduce antibiotic use will require balanced consideration of the 
benefits of reducing antibiotic resistance against any potential 
unintended consequences.

Our multidisciplinary team, which included experts in 
veterinary medicine and animal agriculture (HWB, 
SCC), infectious diseases (JDK), systematic review 
methodology (PER, WAG), and library sciences (HG), 
developed a search strategy consisting of controlled 
vocabulary and keywords (appendix pp 2–5) that 
described three comprehensive search themes: the 
animal populations of interest (theme 1), resistance to 
the antibiotics on the WHO list of Critically Important 
Antimicrobials for Human Medicine and the World 
Organisation 
for 
Animal 
Health 
(OIE) 
List 
of 
Antimicrobial Agents of Veterinary Importance (non-
proprietary names searched only; theme 2),18,19 and 
interventions to restrict antibiotic use (theme 3). 
Resources from the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the UN informed the terms used for theme 1, 
specifically for terms relating to aquaculture.20 The 
three broad themes were combined using the Boolean 
operator “AND”. The search strategy was peer-reviewed 
by research librarians within the University of Calgary 
and at WHO. Though the terms used in the search 
strategy were in English, no limits were placed on 
publication language. Foreign-language articles were 
therefore still captured by this search strategy (appendix 
pp 2–5). Database-specific subject headings and 
controlled vocabulary were adapted when necessary from 
the original MEDLINE search.
The electronic database search was enhanced by 
scanning reference lists of relevant review articles and 
articles included in this systematic review that were 
published from 2010 onward, and by reviewing 
conference proceedings from major scientific meetings. 
Grey literature was identified by searching websites of 
relevant health agencies, professional associations, and 
other specialised databases (appendix pp 6–15). Finally, 
experts in surveillance and epidemiology of antimicrobial 
use and resistance, veterinary medicine, and animal 
health policy were contacted regarding potential missed, 
ongoing, or unpublished studies. The WHO Guideline 
Development Group also provided feedback with regards 
to relevant new or missing studies.
Two authors (KLT and NPC) independently reviewed 
all identified abstracts for eligibility. Abstracts that 
reported original research, described an intervention that 
aimed to reduce antibiotic use in animals, and described 
antibiotic resistance in animals or humans were selected 
for full-text review. Disagreements were resolved by 
consensus or third-party consultation (SCC) when 
consensus could not be achieved.
The same reviewers then performed a full-text review 
of articles meeting eligibility criteria for the systematic 
review. Articles were retained if the population studied 
included food-producing animals (within the previously 
mentioned classifications); the interventions aimed to 
reduce the use of one or more antibiotics in food-
producing animals (these interventions may be of any 
type [including but not limited to mandatory or voluntary 
bans, antibiotic-free or organic farming systems, the 
creation of national reduction targets, requiring culture 
and sensitivity testing prior to antibiotic use] and at any 
level [including restrictions for only certain indications 
such as growth promotion to complete restrictions that 
do not permit any antibiotic use for any reason]); there 
was a presence of a comparator for which there was no 
restriction of antibiotic use in food-producing animals 
(historical comparators were considered eligible); the 
outcomes included the presence of genotypic or 
phenotypic antibiotic resistant bacteria or changes to 
antibiotic susceptibility in food-producing animals or in 
humans; and if the studies used were original research.
To be as inclusive and comprehensive as possible, there 
were no limits placed based on study quality, with study 
quality issues handled through sensitivity analyses 
instead. The classifications of food-producing animals 
included in the population of interest were identified 
through consensus within our study team and WHO 
AGISAR, and include the most commonly consumed 
food-producing animals globally.21 No limits were placed 
on the bacterial species studied. Inter-rater agreement 
between the two reviewers for inclusion into the 
systematic review at the full-text review stage was good 
(κ=0·74).
Data analysis
KLT and NPC extracted data from individual studies using 
a predesigned form obtaining data on the author, year, 
study design (eg, randomised trial, non-randomised trial, 
cross-sectional design, or pre-post study), country, species 
and age of animal, number of farms or animals used in 
analysis, sample type (eg, faeces and meat), sampling 
point (eg, farm, slaughter, or retail), description of 
intervention, description of comparator, antibiotic panels, 
laboratory procedure, bacteria investigated, and prevalence 
of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in intervention and control 
groups. The same two reviewers independently, and in 
duplicate, assessed the methodological quality of each 
individual study based on prespecified study quality 
indicators adapted from the Downs and Black checklist.22 
Absolute risk differences within individual studies 
were calculated for each individual antibiotic by 
subtracting the proportion of isolates resistant to that 
antibiotic in the control group from the proportion in the 
intervention group. Resistance was considered a 
dichotomous outcome, as classified by the individual 
primary studies. Isolates with intermediate susceptibility 
were classified as susceptible. 
Meta-analyses were done separately for animal and 
human studies. Meta-analysis was only done if there 
were six or more studies, as between-study variance 
cannot be estimated accurately with fewer than this 
number and might have resulted in biased pooled 
estimates when the meta-analysis was done.23 Studies 
that did not report absolute risk differences in antibiotic 
resistance or did not provide sufficient data to allow its

calculation were not included in meta-analyses.
We pooled absolute risk differences, by antibiotic class, 
using DerSimonian and Laird random effects models.24 
A pooled negative risk difference would indicate a lower 
prevalence of resistance to that antibiotic class in the 
intervention group compared to the control group. A 
random effects model was felt necessary a priori 
regardless of actual heterogeneity of findings because the 
studies were known to be clinically heterogeneous, 
assessing various interventions across different regions 
globally. The most common unit of analysis in individual 
studies was at the isolate level. Studies using a different 
unit of analysis were not included in meta-analysis.
For the animal studies, we made an a priori decision to 
pool analyses within five groups: Enterobacteriaceae in 
meat samples, Enterococcus spp in faecal samples, 
Campylobacter spp in faecal samples, Campylobacter spp in 
meat samples, and Staphylococcus spp in milk samples. 
These divisions were made because of fundamental 
differences in these bacterial groups in terms of their 
microbiological characteristics, innate antibiotic resistance, 
and potential for pathogenicity.25–28 Within each of these 
groups, separate meta-analyses were done for each 
different antibiotic class, and also for multidrug resistance.

If this was not defined by study authors, we considered 
multidrug resistance to be resistance to two or more 
antibiotics, as this was the most commonly used definition 
within the primary research studies. Heterogeneity across 
studies was assessed using the Q statistic (significance 
level of p≤0·10) and the I² statistic.29,30
If a study provided multiple point estimates (ie, multiple 
antibiotics that fell within the same antibiotic class, 
multiple bacterial species that fell within the same genus, 
or multiple measures across different geographical 
regions), we used a fixed effects model with inverse 
variance weighting to generate a single point estimate 
(risk difference) per antibiotic class, per analytic group, for 
each study. If studies examined more than one bacterial 
group (eg, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus), then a 
separate set of risk differences (by antibiotic class) were 
generated for each group. For longitudinal study designs 
with repeated measures of antibiotic resistance, the first 
and last datapoints were used to calculate risk differences.

For animal studies that could not be included in 
meta-analysis because of inadequate reporting or where 
fewer than six studies could be pooled, a semi-
quantitative analysis was completed to visualise trends 
in phenotypic antibiotic resistance across bacterial 
categories 
and 
antibiotic 
classes. 
Results 
from 
individual studies were colour-coded within a table to 
illustrate whether prevalence of resistance to each 
antibiotic class in intervention groups was lower, 
higher, or not significantly different compared with the 
control groups.
Because of the low numbers of human studies, we 
chose to do a single meta-analysis, rather than a set of 
meta-analyses based on the five analytic groupings as 
for the animal studies. This approach was justified as 
the meta-analysis results from animal studies suggested 
that pooled effect estimates were not modified by 
sample type, bacteria isolated, and antibiotics tested. 
The unit of analysis was the sample rather than the 
isolate, as most human studies reported sample-level 
data. 
Random 
effects 
models 
were 
used, 
and 
heterogeneity was assessed in the same manner as for 
animal studies.
For animal studies, we also did a so-called bundled 
meta-analysis, which included all studies amenable to 
meta-analysis, ignoring specific bacterial species, sample 
types, units of analysis, and antibiotic classes, for the sole 
purposes of stratifying analysis and assessing publication 
bias. A single effect estimate (absolute risk difference) 
was generated for each study by doing a within-study 
meta-analysis using random effects models. This 
bundled meta-analysis was done to allow meaningful 
and statistically powered stratified analyses. This 
approach was felt to be appropriate based on preceding 
meta-analytic results showing generally consistent 
findings across constituent elements.
We did stratified analyses for human and animal studies 
for different study populations, sample types, intervention 
characteristics, and study quality criteria. Meta-regression 
was used to identify whether these factors were significant 
predictors of the underlying heterogeneity.
Publication bias was assessed separately for animal 
and human studies, including all studies for which we 
did meta-analyses. This was done using Begg’s test in 
addition to the visual inspection of a funnel plot.31 
Sensitivity analysis using the Duval and Tweedie non-
parametric trim and fill procedure was also implemented 
if there was any suggestion of visual asymmetry on the 
funnel plots.32 Data were analysed in Stata version 14.
Role of the funding source
WHO was involved in the development of the research 
question, the study design, and the study protocol; they 
also peer-reviewed the final search strategy. They had no 
involvement in data extraction or interpretation of 
findings. The authors have been given permission by 
WHO to publish this article. We presented the findings 
to WHO AGISAR in October, 2016, and to the WHO 
Guideline Development Group in March, 2017
. The 
corresponding author had full access to all the data in the 
study and had final responsibility for the decision to 
submit for publication.

The initial search strategy identified a total of 
9008 citations, with an additional 56 identified by 
contacting experts in the field of antibiotic use and 
resistance, and another 82 through searching reference 
lists of included studies and relevant review articles. From 
these, 3201 duplicates were removed, and 5945 records 
were screened for eligibility through title and abstract 
review. After removal of the 5559 records that were not 
relevant to the research objectives, 386 full-text articles 
were reviewed. Of these, 181 studies were included in the 
systematic review (figure 1; references for all included 
studies are in the appendix pp 52–64). A total of 179 studies 
reported on the outcome of antibiotic resistance in 
animals, and 21 reported on the outcome of antibiotic 
resistance in humans (with an overlap of 19 studies that 
reported outcomes for both animals and humans).
81 studies were from the USA and 78 were from Europe 
(appendix p 16). Six study populations were from Asia 
and one was from Africa. Five studies did not specify the 
countries in which their study populations were located.
Of the 179 animal studies, 148 were journal articles, 
20 were meeting abstracts or conference proceedings 
without accompanying full-text articles, nine were 
dissertations, and two were government or organisation 
reports (table 1). Most studies had a cross-sectional 
design (n=126). There were 50 longitudinal studies, and 
three non-randomised interventional trials. Poultry was 
the most commonly studied animal population, followed 
by swine and dairy cattle (appendix pp 17–32). Of the 
21 human studies, 19 were journal articles, one was a 
meeting abstract, and one was an organisation report. 
13 studies had a longitudinal design; eight were cross-
sectional. The human population studied was most 
commonly farm workers and their household contacts 
(appendix pp 33–35).
Interventions were classified into four categories: 
externally imposed bans or restrictions of antibiotic use 
(36 animal studies, nine human studies); organic inter-
ventions, as defined by the study and the country-specific 
regulations for organic certification (87 animal studies 
and two human studies); self-labelled antibiotic-free, 
free-range, or pasture systems (38 animal studies, 
five human studies); and voluntary reduction of antibiotic 
use (29 animal studies, five human studies). These 
intervention categories were not mutually exclusive. For 
example, studies that reported antibiotic resistance in 
antibiotic-free versus organic versus conventional meats 
were considered to include both organic and antibiotic-
free interventions.
Study quality was assessed for all studies (table 2; 
appendix pp 36–46). Nearly all studies had a clearly 
defined research question or objective. For both animal 
and human studies, an area of weaker study quality was 
the poor description of the study populations and 
management practices on farms and in slaughterhouses. 
Without a clear description of sample characteristics, it 
was difficult to assess whether intervention and control 
groups were similar and whether they were representative 
of the source population. There was also poor description 
of the interventions, specifically in animal studies that 
sampled at the retail level, such as those comparing retail 
meats labelled as organic or antibiotic-free with 
conventional meats. As a result, many studies had 
insufficient detail regarding their farming and production 
systems and degree of antibiotic use (eg, whether 
antibiotics are allowed therapeutically). Finally, few 
animal or human studies adjusted for potential 
confounders, despite the many variables that are likely to 
confound the complex association between antibiotic 
resistance and antibiotic use in animals.
Of the 179 studies reporting antibiotic resistance in 
animals, 81 were included in meta-analyses within the 
five analytic groups (table 3). Overall, all pooled estimates 
were less than zero except for amphenicol and 
tetracycline resistance in Campylobacter spp in faecal 
(relative difference 0·00, 95% CI –0·02 to 0·02) and 
meat samples (0·01, 95% CI –0·19 to 0·21). For nearly all 
antibiotic classes, sample types, and bacterial groups, the 
pooled risk of antibiotic resistance in the intervention 
group was lower than in the control group. Of the meta-
analyses that resulted in a negative pooled estimate, the 
pooled absolute risk differences ranged between –0·01 
for cephalosporin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae in 
faecal samples (95% CI –0·04 to 0·01) and –0·39 for 
macrolide resistance in Enterococcus spp in faecal 
samples (95% CI –0·56 to –0·23). This corresponds to a 
reduction in the proportion of isolates that were antibiotic 
resistant in the intervention group compared with the 
control group by 1–39%. Most absolute risk differences 
were in the –0·15 to –0·10 range, indicating a 
10–15% reduction in the proportion of antibiotic-resistant 
isolates in the intervention groups compared with the

control groups. The pooled effect estimates appeared 
greatest for Enterococcus spp (range relative difference 
[RD] –0·39 to –0·13), and least for Campylobacter  (range 
RD –0·15 to 0·01). Meta-analysis of the absolute risk 
difference of multidrug resistance was done for animal 
studies testing Enterobacteriaceae in faecal (figure 2A) 
and meat samples (figure 2B). This showed an absolute 
risk reduction of 24–32% in the proportion of isolates 
that were multidrug resistant in intervention groups 
compared with control groups.
63 studies that reported on phenotypic resistance could 
not be included in either the main meta-analyses (within 
the five analytic groupings) or the bundled meta-analyses 
(for stratified analyses), because of insufficient data to 
calculate a risk difference in antibiotic resistance, or 
because sample sizes were not reported. Results of these 
studies are qualitatively described in the appendix 
(pp 47–50), and corroborated the results of the meta-
analysis. Most studies showed lower antibiotic resistance 
in intervention compared with control groups, although 
a smaller number of studies showed no difference in 
antibiotic resistance between the two groups.
Of the 21 studies that reported antibiotic resistance in 
humans, 13 were included in the meta-analysis (figure 3). 
The other eight studies were not pooled because the unit 
of analysis was at the isolate (rather than the human) 
level, there was insufficient data to calculate risk 
differences in antibiotic resistance, sample sizes of 
intervention and control groups were not reported, or a 
combination of the above. All 13 studies showed either 
no difference or a lower risk of antibiotic resistance in 
the intervention group compared with the control group. 
Results from nine of the 13 studies were significant, with 
absolute risk differences ranging from –0·85 to –0·09. 
The pooled estimate of the absolute risk difference of 
antibiotic resistance, across all classes of antibiotics, was 
–0·24 (95% CI –0·42 to –0·06). The pooled prevalence of 
antibiotic-resistant bacteria in humans was 24% lower in 
intervention groups in which there was reduced use of 
antibiotics in animals, compared with control groups.
Due to the heterogeneity across studies, with an I² 
generally between 51·3% and 99·4% for animal studies and 
an I² of 97·4% for human studies, stratified analysis was 
done by study characteristics and quality criteria (table 4 for 
animal studies, table 5 for human studies). Overall, there 
were no significant differences in the stratified effect 
estimates based on the strength of intervention. 
Furthermore, effect estimates from studies where 
interventions restricted the use of all antibiotics for any 
indication did not differ from studies where interventions 
allowed the use of antibiotics for therapeutic purposes.
Stratified meta-analysis of studies that met study quality 
criteria and studies that did not meet quality criteria both 
showed significant risk reductions in antibiotic resistance 
in intervention compared with control groups, although 
effects appeared to be smaller for higher quality compared 
with lower quality studies. This was true of both animal 
and human studies, though p values on meta-regression 
were significant for only two quality criteria in human 
studies (whether intervention and control groups were 
recruited over the same time period; and whether 
interventions were well described).
We further stratified the meta-analysis by study 
population. In animal studies, the pooled effect estimates 
appeared stronger when the intervention was targeted to 
swine and poultry than when the intervention was targeted 
to cattle, though this finding was not significant on meta-
regression. The differences in pooled effect estimates

might be because swine and poultry farming practices are 
generally intensive (with larger numbers of animals and 
potentially greater antibiotic use), and because antibiotic 
administration tends to be at the herd or flock level, rather 
than the individual animal level. Interventions in swine 
and poultry farming are therefore likely to result in greater 
overall reductions in antibiotic use. A similar dose-
response effect of the interventions within human studies 
is suggested, with pooled effect estimates being stronger 
in farm workers (–0·29, 95% CI –0·54 to –0·04) compared 
with human beings without direct contact with livestock 
animals (–0·09 95% CI –0·13 to –0·05). Despite large 
differences in these pooled risk differences, the meta-
regression did not result in a significant p value, which is 
likely to be because meta-regression analyses are often 
underpowered from few completed studies.
Separate funnel plots were produced for animal and 
human studies (appendix p 51). Visual inspection of both 
plots revealed asymmetry. Begg’s test for funnel plot 
asymmetry was not significant for animal studies (p=0·16) 
but was for human studies (p=0·047). Because there was 
evidence of visual asymmetry, a trim and fill procedure 
was done for both sets of studies. There was no change in 
the risk reduction of antibiotic resistance in animals with 
interventions that reduced antibiotic use with and without 
imputation (both –0·13, 95% CI –0·15 to –0·11). 
Furthermore, there was no change in the risk reduction of 
antibiotic resistance in humans with imputation of 
potential missing studies (–0·27, 95% CI –0·43 to –0·10) 
and without imputation (–0·24, 95% CI –0·42 to –0·06). 
This suggests that publication bias, if present, was likely 
to have had a minimal effect on our findings.
Discussion
Our systematic review assessed interventions that reduce 
antibiotic use in farm animals and uncovered extensive 
literature and important findings. Of 179 identified studies, 
we found an association between interventions that restrict 
antibiotic use and reduction in the prevalence of antibiotic-
resistant bacteria in animals and in different human 
subgroups. Overall, reducing antibiotic use decreased 
prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in animals by 
about 15% and multidrug-resistant bacteria by 24–32%. 
The evidence of effect on human beings was more limited 
and less robust, though meta-analysis of 13 studies showed 
similar results, with a 24% absolute reduction in the 
prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in humans with 
interventions that reduce antibiotic use in animals.
Three recent systematic reviews have explored antibiotic 
resistance in bacteria isolated from organically—versus 
conventionally—farmed animals.33–35 Their conclusions 
were similar to the ones we have reached, although all 
focused only on the single type of intervention, and 
assessed only a single bacterial species, a single sample 
type, or both. Our systematic review is, to our knowledge, 
the most comprehensive and the first to include studies 
that examine all types of interventions that aim to reduce 
antibiotic use in animals, with no limitation on the type of 
sample obtained, the animal species included, or the 
bacterial species tested. We also believe that this is the first 
systematic review of studies examining the association 
between interventions to reduce antibiotic use in food-
producing animals and changes to antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria in human beings. This summary of evidence is an 
essential ingredient to creating evidence-informed global 
strategies on antibiotic use in food-producing animals.
The potential effect that interventions to reduce antibiotic 
use in food-producing animals have on human antibiotic 
resistance is complex. The results of our meta-analysis on 
the human studies included in our systematic review 
consistently suggest that antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be 
exchanged between livestock and farm workers, with the

evidence being weaker and more indirect for transmission 
to other human populations. Transmission from food-
producing animals to humans can occur through 
contaminated animal retail products,36 although the risk of 
this might be low if animal products are adequately 
prepared and cooked. Resistance can also be transmitted 
through the environment through animal faecal matter, 
waste water, and contaminated produce.37 Our systematic 
review has shown that reducing the level of antibiotic use in 
livestock populations is likely to be a beneficial strategy for 
both animals and human beings. Although we do not fully 
understand the mechanisms of cross-species transmission 
of resistant bacteria and their genetic elements, it seems 
clear that the health of humans, animals, and the ecosystem 
are intricately linked, and that an interdisciplinary and 
multi-sectoral approach will be required to address the 
problem of antimicrobial resistance.38
There are some caveats and limitations to our review. 
Despite considerable heterogeneity across studies of both 
food-producing animals and human beings, we chose to 
pool results through meta-analyses for three reasons. 
First, we anticipated a priori that there would be clinical 
heterogeneity across studies, given the wide variety of 
settings studied and interventions described and tested. 
Second, it would have been surprising to not find statistical 
heterogeneity, given the large number of samples in the 
constituent studies that would have resulted in high 
power when statistical testing for heterogeneity. Finally, 
even 
with 
this 
expected 
clinical 
and 
statistical 
heterogeneity, the overall findings were surprisingly 
homogeneous in their ultimate findings, with a consistent 
effect that spanned different populations, interventions, 
and bacterial groups. Having made the decision to pool 
study results, it was essential to have mitigating strategies 
to handle the heterogeneity and explore its sources. To this 
end, we used random effects models in all our analyses 
and used extensive stratified analyses and meta-regression 
to explore contributors to heterogeneity.
As with any systematic review, our study is limited by the 
varied quality and nature of the underlying studies. 
Although many studies had distinct strengths in clearly 
reporting their objectives, hypotheses, and outcomes, 
areas of deficiency in some studies included poor 
descriptions of study groups or interventions, the absence 
of a conrol group in longitudinal studies, and inadequate 
adjustment for potential confounders. Stratified analysis 
showed that studies not meeting quality criteria might 
overestimate the effects of interventions, which is likely to 
be because of the presence of selection bias and 
confounding. Most studies involved cross-sectional 
assessments of antibiotic resistance in intervention 
compared with control groups; in such studies, causal 
inferences between reduction in antibiotic use and 
reduction in the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria 
are less robust than for longitudinal studies. The issue of 
causality was especially challenging for human studies in 
which linkages between the intervention in food-producing 
animals and changes in bacterial resistance in humans 
were indirect and implied; the mode of transmission and 
level of contact with animal or animal products with 
antibiotic resistance were often not identified. Additionally, 
most studies were from North America and Europe, and 
only one study originated from India, China, or Brazil—
three of the top five global users of antibiotics in livestock 
and in humans.39 This distribution is likely to reflect 
geographical areas in which there has been greatest focus 
on reduction of antibiotic use in animals. Furthermore, 
with only one study included in the review pertaining to 
aquaculture, the effect of interventions to restrict antibiotic 
use in this setting is unknown. Lastly, because primary 
research studies focused only on selected bacterial groups, 
the overall effects of reducing antibiotic use in food-
producing animals on the resistomes of both animals and 
human beings remain unknown.
The caveats discussed are balanced by the considerable 
weight of findings compiled here. We have reviewed and 
meta-analysed a substantial body of evidence that 
suggests there is a reduction in the prevalence of 
antibiotic-resistant bacteria in food-producing animals 
when antibiotic use is reduced in this population. We 
have also summarised and analysed a smaller body of 
evidence suggesting that such interventions might also 
be associated with a reduction in prevalence of antibiotic-
resistant bacteria in humans, particularly those with 
direct contact with food-producing animals. The 
evidence on the whole is not only substantial in its 
volume, but also in its consistency. The findings were 
consistent regardless of bacteria studied, food-producing 
animals in question, interventions implemented, 
samples studied, and regardless of the quality of the 
studies. Therefore, despite the limitations posed by the 
quality of studies and the methodological issues and 
assumptions that are made in them, it would be 
imprudent to entirely discount this body of evidence 
given its coherence and consistency.
Our systematic review and meta-analysis provides 
evidence for only a small piece of a large global problem, 
with 
many 
policy-relevant 
questions 
remaining 
unanswered. Specifically, our systematic review was not 
designed to identify which type or level of restriction on 
antibiotic use in food-producing animals confers the 
greatest benefit. Furthermore, we have not explored any 
potential harms arising from the restriction of antibiotic 
use in food-producing animals, though other studies have 
suggested only limited or temporary effects to productivity 
and animal health when antibiotic growth promoter bans 
have been implemented.40–44 Ultimately, policy decisions 
regarding restriction of antibiotic use will depend upon a 
careful weighing of the evidence of potential unintended 
consequences against the benefits we have shown in this 
review; this should be the focus of future research. There is 
also potential for the use of non-antibiotic alternatives for 
growth promotion and disease prevention. There is a need 
for additional research in this area to better understand

their mechanisms of action and to more robustly show 
their effectiveness in field trials.16
This systematic review, commissioned by WHO, focuses 
on the fundamental question of whether interventions 
that restrict antibiotic use are effective in reducing 
antibiotic resistance. It appears that such interventions 
are indeed associated with a reduction in resistance in 
food-producing animals and in human beings that have 
direct contact with such animals, with a possible, but less 
clear, association in the more general population. These 
findings will be an important consideration as global 
policy options are being considered.
