� Objectives.—To develop evidence-based guideline rec-
ommendations through a systematic review of the litera-
ture to establish standard molecular biomarker testing of
colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues to guide epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) therapies and conventional che-
motherapy regimens.
Methods.—The American Society for Clinical Pathology,
College of American Pathologists, Association for Molec-
ular Pathology, and American Society of Clinical Oncology
convened an expert panel to develop an evidence-based
guideline to establish standard molecular biomarker
testing and guide therapies for patients with CRC. A
comprehensive literature search that included more than
4,000 articles was conducted.
Results.—Twenty-one guideline statements were estab-
lished.
Conclusions.—Evidence supports mutational testing for
EGFR signaling pathway genes, since they provide clini-
cally actionable information as negative predictors of
benefit to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapies for
targeted therapy of CRC. Mutations in several of the
biomarkers have clear prognostic value. Laboratory ap-
proaches to operationalize CRC molecular testing are
presented.

olecular testing to select targeted and conventional
therapies for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC)
has been the focus of a number of recent studies and is
becoming standard practice for management of patients
with CRC. Molecular markers that predict response to a
specific therapy or treatment regimen are known as
predictive biomarkers.1 Monoclonal antibody therapies that
target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) bind the
EGFR
extracellular
domain,
blocking
EGFR
signaling
pathways. Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies have been
the main targeted therapies for CRC that require knowledge
of the mutational status of genes in the pathway as
predictive biomarkers of response to these therapies.2–4
Initial clinical trial data demonstrated that patients with
CRC carrying activating mutations of KRAS affecting exon 2
codons

and
13
did
not
benefit
from
anti-EGFR
monoclonal antibody therapy.2–4 Subsequent studies de-
scribed other mutations in genes of the EGFR signaling

 pathways involving other exons of KRAS and in NRAS,
BRAF, PIK3CA, and PTEN that may affect response of CRC
to anti-EGFR antibody therapies. Guidelines addressing the
molecular testing of EGFR pathway genes beyond KRAS
have not been established and are needed in clinical
practice.
The DNA mismatch repair (MMR) status of CRC may
have predictive value in some clinical settings. While testing
of CRC for MMR has been recommended for all patients
with CRC as a workup test to evaluate for possible Lynch
syndrome,5 guidelines for the use of MMR as a predictive
biomarker of response to therapy have not been reported.
Recent molecular biomarker data have shown the impor-
tance of microsatellite instability (MSI) testing, a marker of
deficient mismatch repair (dMMR), for the selection of
patients for immunotherapy (see section on emerging
biomarkers below).
Alterations
of
a
number of
critical
genes
in
CRC
development and progression such as dMMR and BRAF
activating mutations have been shown to affect prognosis,
as measured by several metrics of tumor progression or
survival.6–8 The utility of incorporating prognostic biomark-
ers in the management of patients with CRC has not been
well defined in clinical practice. Defining the utility of
information gathered from prognostic molecular biomarkers
for clinical management of patients with CRC is warranted.
The postgenome era and the emphasis on precision
genomic-based medicine are providing enormous amounts
of new data and many promising new molecular cancer
biomarkers that may emerge as molecular diagnostic tools
that can be used to enhance successful treatment of patients
with CRC and other cancers. Laboratories and regulatory
agencies are faced with challenges to rapidly and efficiently
provide new test results for the management of patients
with cancer. Laboratory testing of molecular biomarkers
involves the selection of assays, type of specimens to be
tested, timing of ordering of tests, and turnaround time for
testing results. Recent years have shown that a plethora of
technical approaches can effectively be used as long as test
specificity and sensitivity meet the clinical needs. While
earlier testing approaches were focused on one or a few
testing targets, the current need for multiple molecular
markers from potentially minute tumor samples is leading
to greater use of gene panels such as targeted next-
generation sequencing (NGS) cancer panels, which can
assay from a few to hundreds of genes and amplicons with
known mutational hotspots in cancer.
There is a need for current evidence-based recommenda-
tions for the molecular testing of CRC tissues to guide
EGFR-targeted therapies and conventional chemotherapy
regimens. Therefore, the current recommendations were
developed through collaboration of four societies: American
Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), College of American
Pathologists (CAP), Association for Molecular Pathology
(AMP), and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).
This guideline follows well-established methods used in
their development as well as for regular updates, such that
new advances in the molecular testing for clinical manage-
ment of CRC can be integrated in future updates of the
guideline in a timely manner.
PANEL COMPOSITION
The ASCP, the CAP Pathology and Laboratory Quality
Center (the Center), AMP, and ASCO convened an expert
panel consisting of practicing pathologists, oncologists,
geneticists, and a biostatistician with expertise and experi-
ence in molecular biomarker testing and targeted therapies
for CRC. The ASCP, CAP, AMP, and ASCO jointly
approved the appointment of the project, cochairs, and
expert
panel
members.
In
addition,
a
methodologist
experienced in systematic review and guideline develop-
ment consulted with the panel throughout the project.
Conflict of Interest Policy
Prior to acceptance on the expert or advisory panel,
potential members completed a joint guideline conflict of
interest (COI) disclosure process, whose policy and form (in
effect July 2011) require disclosure of material financial
interest in, or potential for benefit of significant value from,
the guideline’s development or its recommendations 12
months prior through the time of publication. The potential
members completed the COI disclosure form, listing any
relationship that could be interpreted as constituting an
actual, potential, or apparent conflict. All project participants
were required to disclose conflicts prior to beginning and
continuously throughout the project’s timeline. Disclosed
conflicts of the expert panel members are listed in Appendix
1 and Appendix 2.
The ASCP, CAP, AMP, and ASCO provided funding for
the administration of the project; no industry funds were
used in the development of the guideline. All panel
members volunteered their time and were not compensated
for their involvement, except for the contracted methodol-
ogist. Please see the Supplemental Digital Content (SDC)
for full details on the COI policy.
OBJECTIVE
The scope of the project was to develop an evidence-
based
guideline
to
help
establish
standard
molecular
biomarker testing, guide targeted therapies, and advance
personalized
care
for
patients
with
CRC.
The
panel
addressed the following key questions:
1. What biomarkers are useful to select patients with CRC
for targeted and conventional therapies?
2. How should tissue specimens be processed for biomark-
er testing for CRC management?
3. How should biomarker testing for CRC management be
performed?
4. How should molecular testing of CRC be implemented
and operationalized?
5. Are there emerging genes/biomarkers that should be
routinely tested in CRC?
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This evidence-based guideline was developed following stan-
dards as endorsed by the Institute of Medicine.9 A detailed
description of the methods and systematic review (including the
quality assessment and complete analysis of the evidence) can be
found in the SDC.
Literature Search and Selection
A comprehensive search for literature was performed in
MEDLINE using the OvidSP (August 1, 2013) and PubMed
(September 17, 2013) interfaces. The initial MEDLINE search
encompassed the publication dates of January 1, 2008, through
August 1, 2013 (OvidSP), and January 1, 2008, through September
17, 2013 (PubMed). A supplemental literature search was
performed using Scopus (September 25, 2013) to identify relevant
articles published between January 1, 2008, and September 25,
2
Arch Pathol Lab Med
ASCP/CAP/AMP/ASCO CRC Biomarker Guideline—Sepulveda et al
 2013, in journals not indexed in MEDLINE. The literature search of
the electronic databases involved two separate searches in each
database, the first using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms
and keywords for the concepts ‘‘colorectal cancer,’’ ‘‘biomarkers,’’
‘‘treatment,’’ and ‘‘treatment outcomes’’ and the second using
terms for the concepts ‘‘colorectal cancer,’’ ‘‘biomarkers,’’ and
‘‘laboratory methods.’’ Limits were set for human studies published
in English, and a publication filter was applied to exclude lower
levels of evidence such as letters, commentaries, editorials, and case
reports. The Ovid search was rerun on February 12, 2015, to
identify articles published since August 1, 2013.
In addition to the searches of electronic databases, an Internet
search of international health organizations, the National Guide-
lines Clearinghouse, and Guidelines International Network was
conducted for existing relevant guidelines or protocols. Guidelines
were included if they were published since 2008 in English. The
proceedings of the meetings of the ASCO and ASCO-Gastroin-
testinal Cancers Symposium, European Society for Medical
Oncology, and the American Association for Cancer Research
from 2012 and 2013 were also searched for relevant abstracts.
A focused examination of all systematic reviews retrieved by the
initial literature search and retained after full-text review was
performed to identify primary research studies not already
included. In addition, recommendations from the expert panel
were reviewed, and the reference lists of all articles deemed eligible
for inclusion were scanned for relevant reports. The results of all
searches were combined and deduplicated.
Detailed information regarding the literature search strategy can
be found in the SDC.
Eligible Study Designs
Practice guidelines, consensus documents, systematic reviews,
meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, comparative studies,
reviews, and evaluation studies were eligible for inclusion. In
addition to journal articles, the search identified meeting abstracts.
Inclusion Criteria
Published studies were selected for full-text review if they met
each of the following criteria:
1. Patients with colorectal or rectal cancer with a pathology
diagnosis of adenocarcinoma or adenocarcinoma with neuro-
endocrine differentiation, either primary or metastatic
2. Patients of all ages
3. Patients with cancer of any invasive stage (T1-T4)
4. Biomarker testing such as KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral
oncogene homolog), DNA MMR/MSI, BRAF (V-raf murine
sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1), NRAS (neuroblastoma
RAS viral [v-ras] oncogene homolog), PIK3CA (phosphatidyli-
nositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha),
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), MLH1 (MutL
homolog 1) methylation, or gene expression profiles

nonrectal cancers, tumor types other than adenocarcinoma or
adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation)
2. Patients with noninvasive tumors (ie, intraepithelial, dysplasia,
in situ, polyps without carcinoma)
3. Studies of colorectal cancers without biomarker testing, novel
biomarkers—for example, VEG-F (vascular endothelial growth
factor), XRCC1 (X-ray repair complementing defective repair in
Chinese hamster cells 1), IGF (insulin-like growth factor), ERCC
(excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency,
complementation group 1), micro-RNA, TYMS (thymidylate
synthetase), GCC (guanylyl cyclase C), LINE (long interspersed
nucleotide element) methylation, CIMP (CpG island methylator
phenotype), HER2 (V-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral
oncogene homolog 2), CIN (chromosomal instability) status

7. Noncomparative studies, letters, commentaries, or editorials
8. Studies that did not address at least one of the defined inclusion
criteria
9. Studies with fewer than 50 patients per comparison arm
Outcomes of Interest
The primary outcomes of interest included survival outcomes
and performance characteristics of laboratory testing assays.
Survival outcomes included overall survival (OS), disease-free
survival (DFS), progression-free survival (PFS), recurrence-free
survival, time to recurrence, and response to therapy (eg, complete
and partial response). Laboratory data and test performance
characteristics included percent mutation, concordance of testing
methods, sensitivity of testing methods, specificity of testing
methods, concordance of detected mutations between primary
and metastatic mutations (number [%] of cases with mutations
versus number of cases with no mutations in the gene of interest),
and concordance of mutations (synchronous primary versus
metastatic, metachronous primary versus metastatic, between
synchronous metastases, between metachronous metastases).
Quality Assessment
An assessment of the quality of the evidence was performed for
all retained studies following application of the inclusion and
exclusion criteria by the methodologist. Using this method, studies
deemed to be of low quality would not be excluded from the
systematic review but would be retained and their methodologic
strengths and weaknesses discussed where relevant. Studies would
be assessed by confirming the presence of items related to both
internal and external validity, which are all associated with
methodologic rigor and a decrease in the risk of bias. The quality
assessment of the studies was performed by determining the risk of
bias by assessing key indicators, based on study design, against
known criteria. (Refer to the SDC for detailed discussion of the
quality assessment.)
For strength of the evidence, the panel considered the level of
evidence, as well as its quantity and quality of included studies.
The level of evidence was based on the study design as described
in Table 1.10 In general, level I and II evidence is considered
most appropriate to answer clinical questions, but in the absence
of such high-quality evidence, the panel considered data from
lower quality studies. The quantity of evidence refers to the
number of studies and number of cases included for each
outcome in the recommendation. The quality of studies reflects
how well the studies were designed to eliminate bias and threats
to validity.
The appropriateness of the study design and data collected,
relevance and clarity of findings, and adequacy of conclusions were
evaluated. Each study was assessed individually (refer to the SDC
for individual assessments and results) and then summarized by
study type. Components such as generalizability and applicability
were also considered when determining the strength of evidence. A
summary of the overall quality of the evidence was given
considering the evidence in totality. Ultimately, the designation
(ie, rating or grade) of the strength of evidence is a judgment by the
expert panel of its level of confidence that the evidence from the
studies informing the recommendations reflects true effect. Table 2
describes the grades for strength of evidence.11
Assessing the Strength of Recommendations
Development of recommendations requires that the panel review
the identified evidence and make a series of key judgments (using
Arch Pathol Lab Med
ASCP/CAP/AMP/ASCO CRC Biomarker Guideline—Sepulveda et al
3
 procedures described in the SDC). Grades for strength of
recommendations were developed by the CAP Pathology and
Laboratory Quality Center and are described in Table 3.11
Guideline Revision
This guideline will be reviewed every 4 years or earlier in the
event of publication of substantive and high-quality evidence that
could potentially alter the original guideline recommendations. If
necessary, the entire panel will reconvene to discuss potential
changes. When appropriate, the panel will recommend revision of
the guideline to the ASCP, CAP, AMP, and ASCO for review and
approval.
Disclaimer
Practice guidelines and consensus statements reflect the best
available evidence and expert consensus supported in practice.
They are intended to assist physicians and patients in clinical
decision making and to identify questions and settings for further
research. With the rapid flow of scientific information, new
evidence may emerge between the time a practice guideline or
consensus statement is developed and when it is published or read.
Guidelines and statements are not continually updated and may
not reflect the most recent evidence. Guidelines and statements
address only the topics specifically identified therein and are not
applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases.
Furthermore, guidelines and consensus statements cannot account
for individual variation among patients and cannot be considered
inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other
treatments. It is the responsibility of the treating physician or other
health care provider, relying on independent experience and
knowledge, to determine the best course of treatment for the
patient. Accordingly, adherence to any practice guideline or
consensus statement is voluntary, with the ultimate determination
regarding its application to be made by the physician in light of
each patient’s individual circumstances and preferences. The ASCP,
CAP, AMP, and ASCO make no warranty, express or implied,
regarding guidelines and statements and specifically exclude any

omissions.
RESULTS
A total of 4,197 studies met the search term requirements.
A total of 123 articles were included for data extraction.
Excluded articles were available as discussion or background
references. The panel convened 14 times (11 teleconference
webinars and three face-to-face meetings) from July 27,
2013, through September 24, 2015, to develop the scope,
draft recommendations, review and respond to solicited
feedback, and assess the quality of evidence that supports
the final recommendations. Additional work was completed
via electronic mail. An open comment period was held from
March 30, 2015, through April 22, 2015, during which draft
recommendations
were posted
on the AMP
website.
Twenty-one guideline statements had an agreement rang-
ing from 60% to 94% for each statement from the open-
comment period participants (refer to Outcomes in the SDC
for full details). The website received a total of 248
comments. Teams of three to four expert panel members
were assigned three to five draft recommendations to review
all comments received and provide an overall summary to
the rest of the panel. Following panel discussion and the
final quality of evidence assessment, the panel members
determined whether to maintain the original draft recom-
mendation as is, revise it with minor language change, or
consider it as a major recommendation change. The expert
panel modified eight draft statements based on the feedback
during the open-comment period and the considered
judgment process. Resolution of all changes was obtained
by majority consensus of the panel using nominal group
technique (rounds of email discussion and multiple edited
recommendations) among the panel members. The final
recommendations were approved by the expert panel with a
formal vote. The panel considered the risks and benefits
throughout the whole process in their considered judgment

 process. Formal cost analysis or cost-effectiveness was not
performed.
Each organization instituted a review process to approve
the guideline. The ASCP assigned the review of the
guideline to a Special Review Panel. For the CAP, an
independent review panel (IRP) representing the Council on
Scientific Affairs was assembled to review and approve the
guideline. The IRP was masked to the expert panel and
vetted through the COI process. The AMP approval process
required the internal review of an independent panel led by
the Publications and Communications Committee chair and
Executive Committee approval. The ASCO approval process
required the review and approval of the Clinical Practice
Guidelines Committee.
GUIDELINE STATEMENTS
1. Recommendation.—Patients with CRC being consid-
ered for anti-EGFR therapy must receive RAS mutational
testing. Mutational analysis should include KRAS and NRAS
codons 12 and 13 of exon 2, 59 and 61 of exon 3, and 117
and 146 of exon 4 (‘‘expanded’’ or ‘‘extended’’ RAS) (Table
4).
Aberrant activation of EGFR signaling pathways in CRC is
primarily associated with activating mutations of genes in
the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylino-
sitol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Together, KRAS, NRAS, and
BRAF mutations have been reported to occur in more than
half of all CRC cases, and KRAS or NRAS and BRAF
mutations are inversely associated, with a small proportion
of individual CRCs showing co-occurrence of RAS and RAF
mutations.3,12
Cetuximab and panitumumab are antibodies that bind to
the extracellular domain of EGFR, blocking the binding of
EGF and other EGFR endogenous ligands, thereby blocking
EGFR signaling. Earlier studies reported the effects of anti-
EGFR antibody treatment independent of KRAS status.13–16
However, it was later reported that targeted EGFR therapies
with cetuximab or panitumumab improve PFS and OS in
patients with metastatic CRC with wild-type KRAS but not
for patients with mutated KRAS.2,3,17 In these earlier studies,
only mutations of KRAS exon 2 were considered. Based on
the available clinical trial data in 2009, ASCO recommended
that patients with metastatic CRC who are candidates for
anti-EGFR antibody therapy should have their tumor tested
for KRAS mutations in a Clinical Laboratory Improvements
Amendments ’88 (CLIA)–accredited laboratory.2
A large body of evidence was available to guide the
recommendation in the current guideline for RAS testing in
colorectal cancers (Table 5 and Supplemental Table 14).
From 2008 to 2015, there were 311 primary studies that
included 74,546 patients and reported treatment outcomes
for patients with RAS mutations compared with non-
mutated/wild type.12–16,18–45 The most common comparison
of anti-EGFR antibody treatment outcomes was between
KRAS
mutation
versus
KRAS
nonmutated/wild
type.18–20,22,24–26,28–31,33–42 Some studies also compared the
effects of adding an anti-EGFR inhibitor to KRAS non-
mutated/wild-type
patients
versus
chemotherapy
alone.18,22,24,26,28,36–38 A few studies reported anti-EGFR
antibody treatment outcomes for the following compari-
sons: KRAS G13D versus codon 12 mutations,32 KRAS
codon 13 mutations versus other mutations,21 and G13D
versus other exon 2 mutations.23

Guideline Statement
Strength of
Recommendation
1. Patients with colorectal carcinoma being considered for anti-EGFR therapy must receive RAS
mutational testing. Mutational analysis should include KRAS and NRAS codons 12 and 13 of exon
2, 59 and 61 of exon 3, and 117 and 146 of exon 4 (‘‘expanded’’ or ‘‘extended’’ RAS).
Recommendation
2a. BRAF p.V600 (BRAF c.1799 [p.V600]) mutational analysis should be performed in colorectal cancer
tissue in patients with colorectal carcinoma for prognostic stratification.
Recommendation
2b. BRAF p.V600 mutational analysis should be performed in deficient MMR tumors with loss of MLH1
to evaluate for Lynch syndrome risk. Presence of a BRAF mutation strongly favors a sporadic
pathogenesis. The absence of a BRAF mutation does not exclude risk of Lynch syndrome.
Recommendation
3. Clinicians should order mismatch repair status testing in patients with colorectal cancers for the
identification of patients at high risk for Lynch syndrome and/or prognostic stratification.
Recommendation
4. There is insufficient evidence to recommend BRAF c.1799 p.V600 mutational status as a predictive
molecular biomarker for response to anti-EGFR inhibitors.
No recommendation
5. There is insufficient evidence to recommend PIK3CA mutational analysis of colorectal carcinoma
tissue for therapy selection outside of a clinical trial.
No recommendation
Note: Retrospective studies have suggested improved survival with postoperative aspirin use in
patients whose colorectal carcinoma harbors a PIK3CA mutation.
6. There is insufficient evidence to recommend PTEN analysis (expression by immunohistochemistry or
deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization) in colorectal carcinoma tissue for patients who are
being considered for therapy selection outside of a clinical trial.
No recommendation
7. Metastatic or recurrent colorectal carcinoma tissues are the preferred specimens for treatment
predictive biomarker testing and should be used if such specimens are available and adequate. In
their absence, primary tumor tissue is an acceptable alternative and should be used.
Expert consensus opinion
8. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue is an acceptable specimen for molecular biomarker
mutational testing in colorectal carcinoma. Use of other specimens (eg, cytology specimens) will
require additional adequate validation, as would any changes in tissue-processing protocols.
Expert consensus opinion
9. Laboratories must use validated colorectal carcinoma molecular biomarker testing methods with
sufficient performance characteristics for the intended clinical use. Colorectal carcinoma molecular
biomarker testing validation should follow accepted standards for clinical molecular diagnostics tests.
Strong recommendation
10. Performance of molecular biomarker testing for colorectal carcinoma must be validated in
accordance with best laboratory practices.
Strong recommendation
11. Laboratories must validate the performance of IHC testing for colorectal carcinoma molecular
biomarkers (currently IHC testing for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) in accordance with best
laboratory practices.
Strong recommendation
12. Laboratories must provide clinically appropriate turnaround times and optimal utilization of tissue
specimens by using appropriate techniques (eg, multiplexed assays) for clinically relevant molecular
and immunohistochemical biomarkers of colorectal cancer.
Expert consensus opinion
13. Molecular and IHC biomarker testing in colorectal carcinoma should be initiated in a timely fashion
based on the clinical scenario and in accordance with institutionally accepted practices.
Expert consensus opinion
Note: Test ordering can occur on a case-by-case basis or by policies established by the medical staff.
14. Laboratories should establish policies to ensure efficient allocation and utilization of tissue for
molecular testing, particularly in small specimens.
Expert consensus opinion
15. Members of the patient’s medical team, including pathologists, may initiate colorectal carcinoma
molecular biomarker test orders in accordance with institutionally accepted practices.
Expert consensus opinion
16. Laboratories that require send-out of tests for treatment predictive biomarkers should process and
send colorectal carcinoma specimens to reference molecular laboratories in a timely manner.
Expert consensus opinion
Note: It is suggested that a benchmark of 90% of specimens should be sent out within 3 working days.
17. Pathologists must evaluate candidate specimens for biomarker testing to ensure specimen adequacy,
taking into account tissue quality, quantity, and malignant tumor cell fraction. Specimen adequacy
findings should be documented in the patient report.
Expert consensus opinion
18. Laboratories should use colorectal carcinoma molecular biomarker testing methods that are able to
detect mutations in specimens with at least 5% mutant allele frequency, taking into account the
analytical sensitivity of the assay (limit of detection [LOD]) and tumor enrichment (eg,
microdissection).
Expert consensus opinion
Note: It is recommended that the operational minimal neoplastic carcinoma cell content tested
should be set at least two times the assay’s LOD.
19. Colorectal carcinoma molecular biomarker results should be made available as promptly as feasible
to inform therapeutic decision making, both prognostic and predictive.
Expert consensus opinion
Note: It is suggested that a benchmark of 90% of reports be available within 10 working days from
date of receipt in the molecular diagnostics laboratory.
20. Colorectal carcinoma molecular biomarker testing reports should include a results and interpretation
section readily understandable by oncologists and pathologists. Appropriate Human Genome
Variation Society and Human Genome Organisation nomenclature must be used in conjunction
with any historical genetic designations.
Expert consensus opinion
21. Laboratories must incorporate colorectal carcinoma molecular biomarker testing methods into their
overall laboratory quality improvement program, establishing appropriate quality improvement
monitors as needed to ensure consistent performance in all steps of the testing and reporting
process. In particular, laboratories performing colorectal carcinoma molecular biomarker testing
must participate in formal proficiency testing programs, if available, or an alternative proficiency
assurance activity.

 mutations were reported in two studies23,32 and codon 13 over
other KRAS mutations.21
Recent studies showed conclusive evidence that in
addition to mutations in KRAS exon 2, other RAS mutations
in KRAS exons 3 and 4 and NRAS exons 2, 3, and 4 were also
associated with nonresponse of metastatic CRC to anti-
EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy.12,44,46 Douillard et al44
published a reanalysis of the Panitumumab Randomized
Control Trial in Combination with Chemotherapy for
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer to Determine Efficacy (PRIME)
trial, reporting that patients with any RAS mutations were
associated with inferior PFS and OS with panitumumab-
FOLFOX4 treatment, which was consistent with the
findings previously reported for patients with KRAS
mutations in exon 2. Subsequently, a meta-analysis of nine
randomized clinical trials provided further evidence that not
all KRAS exon 2 nonmutated/wild-type tumors benefit from
anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody treatment in metastatic
CRC.12 Patients with colorectal cancers that are KRAS exon 2
nonmutated/wild type but harbor RAS mutations in KRAS
exons 3 and 4 or NRAS exons 2, 3, and 4 also have
significantly inferior anti-EGFR treatment outcomes benefit
compared with those without any RAS mutations (Table 5
and Table 6). RAS mutations occur mostly at exon 2,
followed by mutations in exons 3 and 4 (Table 7). The
results suggest that ‘‘extended’’ or ‘‘expanded’’ RAS
mutation testing (KRAS exons 2, 3, and 4 and NRAS exons
2, 3, and 4) must be performed before the administration of
an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy.12 In summary,
current evidence indicates that both cetuximab and pan-
itumumab should only be prescribed for patients with
metastatic CRCs that are nonmutated/wild type for all
known RAS-activating mutations.12
This recommendation is supported by 34 stud-
ies, 1 2 – 1 6 , 1 8 – 4 5 , 4 7
comprising
29
systematic
stud-
ies,12,13,15,16,18–22,24–42,47 two meta-analyses,14,23 one
randomized controlled trial,44 one prospective cohort
study,45 and one retrospective cohort study.43
Of the 29 systematic reviews,12,13,15,16,18–22,24–42,47 only
three reported using a multidisciplinary panel,19,25,30 and
only one reported taking patient preferences into ac-
count,37 although 13 examined important patient sub-
types.12,15,16,18,21,22,24,27,30,33,37,39,40 All but one had well-
described and reported methods sections.42 Seven did not
report on conflict of interest.13,15,16,34,38,41,42 Only nine rated
the quality of the included evidence, and these same nine
were the only reviews that reported on the strength of the
included evidence.16,18,21,22,24,25,32,37,39 None of the studies
included a plan for updating. None of the systematic
reviews reported industry funding, two reported no
funding,16,31 and 11 did not report on the source of
funding, if any.13,15,26,32,34–36,38,41,42,47 Two of these system-
atic reviews were deemed to have a low risk of bias,24,37 14
were deemed to have a low to moderate risk of
bias,12,16,18,19,21,22,25,27,29,30,32,35,39,47 12 were deemed to have
a moderate risk of bias,13,15,20,26,28,31,33,34,36,38,40,41 and one
was deemed to have a high risk of bias.42
Of the two meta-analyses obtained,14,23 both had well-
reported and reproducible methods sections, both described
the planned pooling a priori, and both discussed the
limitations of their analyses. Neither was based on a
systematic review of the literature, and neither did a quality
assessment of the included studies. One reported nonin-
dustry funding,23 and the other reported industry funding.14
One was deemed to have a low to moderate risk of bias,23
and the other was deemed to have a moderate risk of bias.14
The single randomized controlled trial did not report on
any details of the randomization, including blinding, the
expected effect size and power calculation, and the length of
follow-up.44 It did report on differences in baseline patient
characteristics. This trial did report at least partial industry
funding and was deemed to have a low to moderate risk of
bias.44
The single prospective cohort study reported a balance
between treatment and assessment groups, reported on
baseline characteristics, and made adjustments in the
analysis when differences were found.45 It reported nonin-
dustry funding and was deemed to have a low risk of bias.45
The single retrospective cohort study reported that the
treatment and assessment groups were in balance and also
reported on baseline patient characteristics.43 It did not
report that adjustments were made in the analysis to
account for differences, where differences were found. This
study reported nonindustry funding and was deemed to
have a low risk of bias.43
All of the evidence that supported this recommendation
was assessed, and none was found to have methodologic
flaws that would raise concerns about their findings.
2a. Recommendation.—BRAF p.V600 (BRAF c.1799
[p.V600]) position mutational analysis should be performed
in CRC tissue in selected patients with colorectal carcinoma
for prognostic stratification.
BRAF activating mutations occur in about 8% of advanced
disease patients with CRC47,48 and in approximately 14% of
patients with localized stage II and III CRC.8,49 As such,
mutations in BRAF constitute a substantial subset of patients
with CRC. The key questions related to BRAF mutations are
whether patients whose cancers carry a BRAF mutation have
a poorer outcome compared with BRAF mutation-negative
tumors and whether the presence of a mutation predicts
benefit from or lack thereof to anti-EGFR therapy.
Four systematic reviews20,50–52 and three systematic
reviews that included meta-analyses47,48,53 pertaining to
the prognostic and predictive value of BRAF mutations in
patients with CRC were identified through our systematic
review process (Table 8 and Supplemental Table 14). These
studies revealed that patients with advanced CRC who
possess a BRAF mutation have significantly poorer out-
comes as measured by PFS and OS and have a decreased
response rate to anti-EGFR therapy relative to those with
nonmutated BRAF. Poorer OS was also demonstrated for
those patients with earlier stage II and III CRC having a
BRAF mutation8,54; however, the poorer outcome appears to
be primarily the result of decreased OS after relapse in these
patients rather than a harbinger of an increased rate of
relapse. Finally, while outcomes in advanced disease
patients with BRAF mutations were poorer relative to
nonmutation patients, the data were consistent with a
modest beneficial impact from the use of anti-EGFR agents
relative to those patients whose tumors contained a RAS
mutation.55 In summary, patients with CRC that contains a
BRAF mutation have a worse outcome relative to non-
mutation patients. Selected patients for BRAF mutation
testing include patients with metastatic disease, since these
patients have particularly poor outcomes. It is important to
know the BRAF c.1799 (p.V600) mutation status of a
patient’s CRC since standard therapy is not adequate for
patients with metastatic disease and BRAF mutation. For
these patients, some studies suggest the use of FOLFIR-

Furthermore, early clinical trials data suggest that the
combination of a BRAF plus EGFR inhibitor appears to be
effective in this population.57–59 Data in support of molecular
testing for BRAF c.1799 (p.V600) mutations in CRC continue
to emerge from clinical trials. A recent publication of the
PETACC-8 (oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin with or
without cetuximab in patients with resected stage III colon
cancer randomised phase 3) trial reported that trials in the
adjuvant setting should consider mismatch repair, BRAF,
and KRAS status for stratification, since BRAF p.V600 and
KRAS mutations were associated with shorter DFS and OS

 review reported by Baas et al20 reported examining

reported well-described and reproducible methods. Three
did not report how conflicts of interest were managed and
reported on.47,51,53 Only two reported on a quality assess-
ment of the included literature,48,50 and only one rated the
strength of the evidence.50 None reported a plan for
updating. While none of the systematic reviews reported
industry funding, one study did not report any funding
support.47 Overall, the risk of bias assessment for this body
of evidence ranged from low48,50 to moderate,20,51,53 and
none were found to have methodologic flaws that would
raise concerns about their findings.
2b. Recommendation.—BRAF p.V600 mutational analy-
sis should be performed in dMMR tumors with loss of
MLH1 to evaluate for Lynch syndrome risk. Presence of a
BRAF mutation strongly favors a sporadic pathogenesis. The
absence of BRAF mutation does not exclude risk of Lynch
syndrome.

 dMMR occurs via several mechanisms. In sporadic CRC,
dMMR is most frequently caused by epigenetic silencing
through CpG methylation primarily of MLH1, with few
cases resulting from somatic mutation of one of the MMR
genes. In Lynch syndrome CRC, the underlying mechanism
is usually a germline mutation of one of the four (MLH1,
MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) mismatch repair genes and, in
rare patients, a deletion involving EPCAM (epithelial cell
adhesion molecule), a gene adjacent to MSH2, that leads to
epigenetic inactivation of the MSH2 gene. dMMR occurs in
15% to 20% of all colorectal cancers, and of these, about
three-fourths are due to MLH1 epigenetic silencing.5,62
dMMR underlies widespread mutations in the genome
and MSI. BRAF p.V600 mutations rarely occur in patients
with germline-based dMMR but have been reported in up to
three-fourths of those with epigenetic MMR gene silencing
(Table 8 and Table 9). Thus, testing for BRAF mutations
serves as a means for distinguishing germline from
epigenetic dMMR, particularly in those cases where the
dMMR is the result of epigenetic silencing of MLH1. For
tumors with a mutation in BRAF and dMMR, it may be
concluded that the basis for their dMMR is less likely to be
germline.5,52,62 In contrast, tumors with dMMR in the
absence of a BRAF mutation may have either germline or
an epigenetic (MLH1 gene promoter hypermethylation)
basis for the dMMR, and specific testing for MLH1 promoter
hypermethylation may be used to further refine the risk of
Lynch syndrome before initiating definitive genetic testing.
Identification of those patients with germline-based dMMR
has clear implications for the patient’s family members.
3. Recommendation.—Clinicians should order mismatch
repair status testing in patients with colorectal cancers for
the identification of patients at high risk for Lynch
syndrome and/or prognostic stratification.
The molecular pathology underlying most MSI tumors is
somatically acquired CpG methylation of the promoter of
the MLH1 gene. About three-fourths of colorectal cancers
with MSI due to MLH1 promoter hypermethylation will
have an acquired BRAF mutation as well. The reason for this
is not understood. Less than one-third of individuals with
dMMR/MSI colorectal tumors do not have underlying
MLH1 promoter hypermethylation but rather have a germ-
line mutation affecting any one of the four DNA MMR
genes noted above. Individuals with germline mutations in
the MMR genes are said to have Lynch syndrome, an
autosomal dominant disorder that confers dramatically
increased risks for colorectal and endometrial cancers and
moderately increases risks for a variety of other tumors.63
Diagnosis of Lynch syndrome is important as active
management of cancer risks has been demonstrated to

 benefit gene mutation carriers,5,64,65 and establishing a
diagnosis creates opportunities for prevention among all
at-risk relatives. Testing for dMMR can be performed by
immunohistochemistry for the four MMR proteins (MLH1,
MSH2, PMS2, and MSH6) or by MSI DNA-based testing, as
discussed in detail in a report by Funkhouser et al66
(recommendation 11).
A systematic review of 31 studies7 reporting survival on
12,782 patients whose tumors were characterized for MSI
showed a favorable prognosis, as determined by both OS
and DFS (Table 10), but this is dependent on stage. In
addition, the presence of MSI in CRC was reported to be
predictive for nonresponse to 5-fluorouracil–based adjuvant
chemotherapy of early stage disease,6 although this has not
been corroborated (Table 10).67 Emerging data indicate that
MMR status may have predictive value in some settings,
specifically in patients with advanced disease being consid-
ered for anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)/
programmed cell death ligand protein-1 (PD-L1) immune
checkpoint inhibitor therapy.68–70
This recommendation is supported by two systematic
reviews that included 38 studies and 16,472 patients.6,7 Both
of these systematic reviews included a well-described and
reproducible methods section, and both reported on
potential conflicts of interest. Only one, the systematic
review reported by Guastadisegni et al,7 reported the source
of funding, which was nonindustry. Due to deficits in the
reporting, one of these systematic reviews was deemed to
have a moderate risk of bias,6 and the other was deemed to
have a low to moderate risk of bias7; however, neither of
these were found to have any major methodologic flaws that
would cause us to question their findings.
4. No Recommendation.—There is insufficient evidence
to recommend BRAF c.1799 (p.V600) mutational status as a
predictive molecular biomarker for response to anti-EGFR
inhibitors.
As noted in recommendation 2a, mutations in position
p.V600 in BRAF are associated with poor prognosis,
especially in patients with metastatic disease. Response
rates to chemotherapy regimens, including regimens with
cetuximab and panitumumab, are lower in patients harbor-
ing BRAF p.V600 mutations51,53,71 (Table 8). Similarly, the
PFS and OS after treatment with EGFR monoclonal
antibodies in combination with chemotherapy are lower in
patients with BRAF p.V600 mutations.47,48 Many of these
analyses used nonrandomized cohorts, thereby making
evaluation of the potential predictive value of the BRAF
p.V600 mutation impossible to discern (Table 8). In addition,
the poor prognosis and low mutation prevalence make
evaluation of the relative benefit of EGFR inhibitors difficult
to evaluate in individual randomized clinical trials.
Meta-analyses of randomized studies of EGFR monoclo-
nal antibodies have been completed to address the question
of the predictive role of BRAF p.V600 mutations. A meta-
analysis of 463 patients with KRAS wild-type and BRAF
p.V600 mutated tumors did not provide sufficient evidence
to exclude a magnitude of benefits seen in KRAS/BRAF wild-
type tumors. Nor was there sufficient evidence to identify a
statistically significant benefit to this treatment.55 A second
meta-analysis showed that EGFR monoclonal antibody
treatment in patients whose tumors contain a BRAF
p.V600 mutation was not associated with significant OS (P
¼ .43), although there was a trend for better PFS (P ¼ .07).72
This suggests insufficient evidence to recommend the use of
BRAF p.V600 as a predictive marker for benefit of anti-EGFR
monoclonal antibodies. More data are required to defini-
tively determine the predictive value of BRAF mutations
relative to anti-EGFR therapy.
This recommendation was supported by five systematic
reviews47,48,51,53,71 (Table 8). None of these systematic
reviews reported forming a multidisciplinary panel, and
none reported including patient representatives in develop-
ing their research questions or interpreting their outcomes.
All of the systematic reviews examined important patient
subtypes, and all used well-described and reproducible
methods. Only the systematic review by Yuan et al48
reported on any potential conflicts of interest, the article
by Mao et al51 stated conflicts were not examined, and the
other three did not report anything regarding conflicts.47,53,71
Only two, the systematic reviews reported by Yang et al71
and Yuan et al,48 rated the quality of the included evidence,
although none of the studies reported on the strength of the
evidence. None of the studies discussed any plans for future
updating. Four reported nonindustry funding for their
systematic reviews,48,51,53,71 and one did not report the
source of funding, if any.47 Two of the systematic reviews
were deemed to have a low risk of bias,48,71 one was deemed
to have a low to moderate risk of bias,47 and two were
deemed to have a moderate risk of bias.51,53 Overall, none of
the systematic reviews were found to have methodologic
flaws that would raise concerns about their findings.
5. No Recommendation.—There is insufficient evidence
to recommend PIK3CA mutational analysis of colorectal
carcinoma tissue for therapy selection outside of a clinical
trial.
Note: Retrospective studies have suggested improved
survival with postoperative aspirin use in patients whose
colorectal carcinoma harbors a PIK3CA mutation.
Despite comprehensive RAS testing (recommendation 1),
many patients still fail to respond to EGFR monoclonal
antibody therapy. Additional biomarkers to guide patient
selection for such therapy are desired.
PIK3CA mutations are observed in 10% to 18% of patients
with CRC, primarily in exons 9 and 20, and lead to a
constitutive activation of p100a enzymatic activity, leading
to an increased PI3K activity and high oncogenic transfor-
mation ability. However, mutations of KRAS or NRAS and
PIK3CA mutations can be detected alternatively and, in
some cases, concurrently in a single CRC.3,8 PIK3CA
mutations are positively correlated with KRAS exon 12 and
13 mutations.3 Several meta-analyses and one individual
patient data large pooled analysis have examined the
prognostic role of PIK3CA in patients with stage IV CRC,
both overall and in the KRAS nonmutated/wild-type
population. These studies have generally indicated poorer
response rate and PFS in patients with the PIK3CA
mutation, a finding that appears to be driven primarily by
patients with exon 20 mutation3,33,50,71 (Table 11). These
meta-analyses have included many of the same studies, as
well as observed and acknowledged between-study hetero-
geneity, and all have concluded further prospective data are
necessary. Contradictory recent studies have also been
recently reported.74 None of the studies considered the
independent role of PIK3CA in the context of comprehen-
sive RAS testing. De Roock et al3 estimated that compre-
hensive PIK3CA testing would increase response rate in the
first-line setting by only 1%. The prognostic impact of
PIK3CA in stage I to III disease has been inconsistent.75–77
Multiple prospective observational studies have demon-
strated an association between aspirin use and decreased
Arch Pathol Lab Med
ASCP/CAP/AMP/ASCO CRC Biomarker Guideline—Sepulveda et al
17
 CRC mortality.78–80 Data on aspirin as a treatment for CRC
(postdiagnosis usage) are more limited and drawn only from
observational studies. Domingo et al81 and Liao et al82 found
a survival advantage for posttreatment aspirin users only in
patients whose tumors exhibit PIK3CA mutations; however,
a recent cohort study did not validate these observations.83
Multiple prospective studies are under way to address the
potential benefit of adding aspirin or other nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs to adjuvant therapy.
This recommendation is supported by two systematic
reviews33,40 obtained from our systematic review. None
reported the composition of a multidisciplinary panel,
reported patient representation or study quality, rated
strength of the evidence reviewed, or disclosed a plan for
updating. However, both systematic reviews did include
relevant patient subgroups and included methods that were
well described and reproducible. In both systematic reviews,
information about the potential conflicts of the panelists was
reported, and funding was provided by nonindustry sources.
Both were found to have a moderate risk of bias, but neither
of the studies providing the evidence base for recommen-
dation 5 were found to have methodologic flaws that would
raise concerns about their findings.
At the present time, the retrospective data for the use of
PIK3CA mutation to deny anti-EGFR antibody therapy in
patients with stage IV CRC or as a selection factor for use of
aspirin in stage I to III tumors are insufficient for clinical use
outside of a clinical trial.
6. No Recommendation.—There is insufficient evidence
to recommend PTEN analysis (expression by immunohis-
tochemistry [IHC] or deletion by fluorescence in situ
hybridization [FISH]) in colorectal carcinoma tissue for
patients who are being considered for therapy selection
outside of a clinical trial.
PTEN functions as a tumor suppressor gene, and loss of
PTEN results in upregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.
PTEN mutations occur in approximately 5% to 14% of
colorectal cancers,4,84 and loss of PTEN expression can be
observed in tumors with KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA
mutations.
Although there is evidence suggesting that PTEN is a
critical factor in cancer development, the association
between PTEN expression and predictive/prognostic value
remains controversial, with several studies suggesting an
association with poorer prognosis and others finding no
association at all. Four systematic reviews were obtained
that reported on loss of PTEN expression compared with
normal PTEN expression and 31 primary studies, including a
total of 2,545 patients20,50,85,86 (Supplemental Table 14). Tests
used included IHC and FISH. Of the four studies that
reported overall survival rates,20,50,85,86 three studies reported
on pooled outcomes.50,85,86 One study reported a significant
difference in favor of normal PTEN expression,86 and the
others reported no significant differences.20,50,85 For PFS,
three studies pooled outcomes,50,85,86 two detected a
significant difference in favor of normal PTEN expres-
sion,85,86 and one showed no significant difference.50 For

Several studies have shown an association between PTEN
loss and local recurrence, advanced TNM stage, lymph node
metastasis, and a lower 5-year survival rate.87–90 However,
several other studies have found no correlation between
PTEN status and patient survival, tumor grade, TNM stage,
lymphatic invasion, and liver metastasis.91–93 Regarding
response to EGFR-targeted therapies, several studies have
shown an association with PTEN loss and lack of response
to cetuximab and panitumumab.94–97 However, other
published studies failed to demonstrate a clear correlation
between loss of PTEN expression and response to anti-
EGFR therapy.98–100 Given the significant discordance in
results, the role of PTEN as a prognostic or predictive
biomarker in CRC is still largely unknown, and research into
the prognostic and predictive significance of PTEN is
ongoing.
This recommendation is supported by 20 stud-
ies,4,20,50,84–100 four20,50,85,86 of which met the inclusion criteria
for inclusion in our systematic review. All four of these were
systematic reviews and included 42 studies and 3,412
patients. None of these systematic reviews reported using
a multidisciplinary panel or reported including the patient
perspective or a plan for future updating. Three50,85,86
reported on important patient subgroups. All four had
well-described and reproducible methods sections.
Three20,50,86 reported that potential conflicts of interest were
examined. Only two50,86 rated the quality of the included
evidence, and these same two were also the only two that
rated the strength of the evidence. Only three20,50,86 reported
on the source of any funding, but all three reported
nonindustry funding. One was deemed to have a low risk
of bias,50 one was deemed to have a low to moderate risk of
bias,86 and two were deemed to have a moderate risk of
bias.20,85 None of the studies were found to have any
methodologic flaws that would bring doubt to their findings.
7. Expert Consensus Opinion.—Metastatic or recurrent
colorectal carcinoma tissues are the preferred specimens for
treatment predictive biomarker testing and should be used if
such specimens are available and adequate. In their absence,
primary tumor tissue is an acceptable alternative and should
be used.
In clinical practice, one or more specimens of CRC from
an individual patient may become available for molecular
testing during the course of the disease. These specimens
may include initial diagnostic biopsy or surgical resection
specimens of the primary tumor and resection, biopsy, or
cytologic specimens from metastatic and recurrent tumor.
Discordance between primary and metastatic lesions may be
attributed to a number of mechanisms, including tumor
heterogeneity already present in the primary tumor, tumor
evolution, where novel mutations are acquired, and, in some
cases, the presence of separate primaries. The systematic
literature review for the CRC guideline was done to identify
studies that compared the mutational status of primary
versus metastatic CRC.
An earlier systematic literature search that was conducted
to include studies testing concordance of KRAS, BRAF,
PIK3CA, and loss of PTEN expression in CRC20 reported the
results of 21 studies, with an overall concordance rate of
93% (range, 76%-100%) for KRAS, 93% for BRAF status, a
range of 89% to 94% for PIK3CA, and 68% for loss of PTEN.
Table 12 shows the summary of two subsequent studies
where KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutation and PTEN
expression were compared in paired primary versus

 metastatic tumor lesions.101,102 Overall concordance rates
between primary and metastatic lesions were high with
more than 90% concordance (Table 12).101,102 In the study by
Lee et al, analysis of KRAS mutation in primary and
recurrent tumors after radical resection showed 20.3%
discordance.103
This recommendation was supported by two retrospective
cohort studies101,102 that were obtained in the systematic
review. Both of these studies compared results within a single
cohort. The study reported by Cejas et al101 reported at least
partial industry funding, and the study reported by Vakiani et
al102 did not report the source of funding, if any. The study by
Cejas et al101 was deemed to have a low to moderate risk of
bias, and the study by Vakiani et al102 was deemed to be low.
Overall, neither of these studies had any methodologic flaws
that would raise concerns about the reported findings.
In summary, given that discordance of mutational status
between primary and metastatic or recurrent CRC lesions
may occur in a number of cases, metastatic or recurrent CRC
tissues are the preferred specimens for treatment predictive
biomarker testing. However, if these specimens are not
available, primary tumor tissue is an acceptable alternative,
given the overall high rates of concordance for the mutation
status of EGFR pathway genes.
8. Expert Consensus Opinion.—Formalin-fixed, paraf-
fin-embedded (FFPE) tissue is an acceptable specimen for
molecular biomarker mutational testing in colorectal carci-
noma. Use of other specimens (eg, cytology specimens) will
require additional adequate validation, as would any
changes in tissue-processing protocols.
The systematic review identified a number of studies,
summarized in Table 13, where CRC KRAS mutational

Arch Pathol Lab Med
ASCP/CAP/AMP/ASCO CRC Biomarker Guideline—Sepulveda et al
 testing was performed using FFPE specimens as well as
fresh or frozen specimens. Recommendation 17 highlights
the importance of review of stained sections of tumor
selected for testing by a pathologist to verify the tumor cell
content population of the sample and demarcate regions for
potential macrodissection or microdissection to enrich for
cancer cells. Biopsy and resection specimens are similarly
acceptable, as long as sufficient tumor cells are present
(Table 13). Cytology specimens may be adequate for testing
but will require proper validation. The use of FFPE cell
blocks allows for the evaluation of tumor cell content and
viability.104 Laboratories will need to establish the minimum
tumor cell content for specimens based on the performance
characteristics of their validated assay.105,126
Liquid biopsy tests use serum or plasma and may be used
for monitoring tumor recurrence and emergence of treat-
ment resistance. The noninvasive nature of this approach
(monitoring through blood testing) offers great potential for
clinical use.106 However, at the present time, the clinical
application of liquid biopsy assays awaits robust validation
and further studies to determine their clinical utility.
9. Strong Recommendation.—Laboratories must use
validated colorectal carcinoma molecular biomarker testing
methods with sufficient performance characteristics for the
intended clinical use. Colorectal carcinoma molecular
biomarker testing validation should follow accepted stan-
dards for clinical molecular diagnostics tests.
Clinical validation assesses the molecular biomarker
testing method in light of clinical characteristics of the
disease or marker being tested, to ensure the test is ‘‘fit for
purpose.’’ Elements of clinical validation include analytical
sensitivity, analytical specificity, clinical sensitivity, and
clinical specificity. Data for clinical validation can be
obtained from studies performed by the laboratory, studies
reported in peer-reviewed literature, or other reliable
sources. CLIA requires clinical laboratories to have a
qualified laboratory director who is responsible for ensuring
that the laboratory provides quality laboratory services for
all aspects of test performance.107 Rigorous validation should
be performed to ensure all molecular marker testing
methods, such as those used for colorectal carcinoma, are
ready for implementation in the clinical laboratory. To reach
that goal, each step of the testing process must be carefully
evaluated and documented. Excellent and comprehensive
documents have been published on this topic, and a detailed
review is provided under recommendation 10. Our system-
atic review of the available literature provided information
regarding the performance characteristics of molecular
marker testing methods of colorectal carcinoma in clinical
use for RAS mutational testing (Table 13). Most studies

 reported the performing characteristic of assays that
detected KRAS exon 2 mutations, as detailed in Table 13.
Direct sequencing of genomic DNA, even after polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the fragment of
interest, has low analytical sensitivity requiring a mutant
allele frequency of about 20% for mutation detection. A
number of more sensitive assays have been developed for
RAS testing, including those listed in Table 13.
Sanger sequencing was used as the most common
baseline assay for comparison against other molecular
detection methods for KRAS mutations. Testing methods
vary widely, including direct Sanger sequencing, amplifica-
tion refractory mutation system, real-time PCR–high-
resolution melting (HRM) assays, allele-specific PCR,
Luminex (Austin, Texas) bead microarray, PCR restriction
fragment length polymorphism strip assays, pyrosequenc-
ing, and, more recently, NGS. Population or clinical
sensitivity of the testing methods for KRAS mutations as
shown in Table 13 ranged between 36% and 59%. Assay
sensitivity ranged from 84.4% to 100%, with Sanger
sequencing on the lower end of the range. Analytical
sensitivity, defined as the lowest detectable mutant allele
fraction, was between 0.5% and 20% across all testing
methods, with most methods performing between 1% and
5% mutant allele fraction. Specificity was between 98% and
100% for most assays, with two studies demonstrating lower
specificity. Positive predictive value percentages varied
between 66% and 100%, with most studies reporting
between 99% and 100%. Negative predictive value percent-
ages were between 97% and 100%. Minimal tumor
percentages reported varied widely between studies. Con-
cordance between assays was between 93% and 100%, with
some variability noted in two retrospective cohort studies.
The available evidence from assays to detect KRAS
mutations supports the use of a number of alternative
assays, as long as their performing characteristics, adjusted
for sample type and percent tumor purity, meet the clinical
sensitivity with acceptable specificity. Recently, NGS has
been used in a number of studies and in laboratory practice
for solid tumor mutational analysis.108 NGS has shown to
meet the sensitivity of detection used in CRC clinical trials
(detecting at least 5% mutant alleles), permitting simulta-
neous testing of hundreds of mutations, and is becoming
widely used. Testing for mutations in multiple genes or gene
loci with multiplex assays such as NGS and other methods
should be done on patients at the time of metastases to
obtain comprehensive genomic information and identify
mutations beyond RAS/BRAF status that might be able to be
targeted if conventional therapies become ineffective.
10. Strong Recommendation.—Performance of molecu-
lar biomarker testing for colorectal carcinoma must be
validated in accordance with best laboratory practices.
Proper validation of CRC biomarker testing is important
to ensure appropriate patient care. If validation is inade-
quate, this can lead to erroneous results and improper
diagnosis, prognosis, and/or therapeutic intervention. For
example, with regard to RAS testing, a false-positive result
would lead to an improper withholding of therapy, whereas
a false-negative result would lead to distribution of an
ineffective therapy, resulting in increased costs and unnec-
essary side effects. As molecular oncology testing grows
more complex with NGS, thorough and proper validation of
preanalytical (specimen type and processing), analytical
(assay performance), and postanalytical (bioinformatics,
annotation, and reporting) steps is imperative.109,110
The design of a validation study somewhat depends on
the analyte (gene), mutations, or molecular alterations
assessed and chosen platform and technology. However,
assay validation should be done using best laboratory
practices in accordance with CLIA (42 CFR 493.1253(b)(2),
also known as Title 42 Chapter IV Subchapter G Part 493
Subpart K§493.1253)111 as applicable to the assay type.
Laboratories should comply with CLIA and their individual
accrediting agency
(eg, CAP, New York State) to fulfill
requirements for validation.111,112 Additional resources for
establishing clinical molecular testing are available to assist
laboratories.113 For the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)–cleared/approved assays (without any modification),
verification of test specifications, including accuracy, preci-
sion, reportable range, and reference range, only needs to be
done.114 For nonwaived, non–FDA-approved assays (labo-
ratory-developed procedures or LDPs), validation must be
performed. Validation design must include the required
elements of analytical accuracy (specificity and sensitivity),
precision, and analytical sensitivity (limit of detection) and
interfering substances and reportable range as applicable.
Clinical sensitivity and specificity, as well as positive and
negative predictive value, should be considered additions.
Additional considerations should include specimen pro-
cessing (including microdissection or macrodissection,
histologic processing, and fixation times) and reagent
stability and storage. Proper controls should be introduced
and used to assess as many of the potential mutations
detected by the assay and to verify the limit of detection
identified in the validation. With high-throughput (NGS)
sequencing, assessing all possible mutations through
control material and specimens is impossible, and continu-
ing validation may need to occur. If NGS is used,
bioinformatics pipelines should be properly validated using
multiple types of mutations (single-nucleotide variants and
insertions/deletions). Finally, reporting should be carefully
considered during the validation process. Resources to assist
laboratories with solid tumor molecular testing have also
been made available through the CLSI.115
Preanalytical Variables
Histologic or preanalytical processing should be consid-
ered and representative processes should be included in the
validation set. Specific specimen types should also be
properly validated. Most tissue used in CRC biomarker
testing is derived from FFPE tissue. Formalin fixation results
in fragmentation of DNA as a result of histone protein
fixation to the DNA. Therefore, most assays for FFPE tissue
are designed to amplify products less than 200 base pairs.
Length of formalin fixation and age of blocks may also be
factors to consider in validation of FFPE tissues. Other tissue
sources should also be separately validated if offered as
clinical tests, especially cytology-based specimens. Various
cytology fixative preparations should be validated as used by
the laboratory. If cell-free assays are considered, these
should be validated as a separate source. Finally, testing
should be limited to invasive carcinoma with exclusion of
adenomatous tissue and benign background tissue cellular
components (eg, normal mucosa, muscularis, inflammation)
as much as possible.
Analytical Variables
Careful specimen selection should be undertaken to cover
as many of the potential detected mutations and expected
specimen types as possible to ensure analytical accuracy. A
22
Arch Pathol Lab Med
ASCP/CAP/AMP/ASCO CRC Biomarker Guideline—Sepulveda et al
 gold-standard method (dideoxy sequencing or other vali-
dated test method) and/or interlaboratory comparison
should be used to verify accuracy of the assay. For example,
the CAP Laboratory Accreditation Program COM.40350
indicates that at least 20 specimens (including positive, low-
positive, and negative specimens) should be included for
qualitative and quantitative assays.112 More specimens may
be required. If it is a single-gene assay, the design should
include as many of the mutations covered by the assay as
possible. If it is a real-time–based allele-specific assay, all
mutations for which a primer probe reaction is built should
be analyzed as reasonably as possible. If it is a pyrosequenc-
ing-based assay, similarly, all of the possible common
mutations for which targeted therapies are indicated should
be tested. Multigene assays based on NGS or other
technology (such as SNaPshot [ThermoFisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA]) require an increased number of specimens
to test as many of the hotspot regions as possible in all
genes included in the assay. With such assays, not all
possible mutations can be validated. It is recommended that
an ongoing validation occur after initial validation, with
verification of novel mutations by either dideoxy sequencing
or real-time PCR, depending on the laboratory capability
and limit of detection. Depending on the technology
employed, important parameters (eg, variant allele frequen-
cy, cyclic threshold values, allele coverage) should be
monitored for interrun and intrarun precision.
CRC specimens can vary from large primary resection
blocks with plenty of tumor cells to small primary tumor or
metastatic CRC liver biopsy specimens to rectal specimens,
after neoadjuvant therapy with minimal tumor percentage.
Many of these tests are ordered for metastatic disease, for
which only a small needle core biopsy specimen or cytologic
sampling is available. Presently, tissue volume and acces-
sibility are decreasing while ancillary testing (IHC and
molecular studies) is increasing. The ability of an assay to be
highly analytically sensitive is important if a laboratory is to
test specimens with low tumor burden. It is recommended
that an assay be able to identify a mutation in a specimen
that has at minimum 20% tumor cells (mutant allele
frequency of 10% assuming heterozygosity). With NGS
and highly sensitive PCR technologies, mutations should be
identifiable in specimens with as little as 10% tumor
(mutant allele frequency of 5% assuming heterozygosity
and diploidy). Lower analytically sensitive assays, such as
dideoxy sequencing, can be used, but it is recommended
that PCR enrichment strategies (eg, coamplification at lower
denaturation temperature-PCR) be used to increase the
analytical sensitivity of the test and require less tumor
percentage. A proper validation study should use cell line
DNA (preferably FFPE treated) or reference control material
manufactured by good manufacturing processes to assess
limit of detection for as many mutations as possible.
Importantly, the limit of detection may differ for mutations
of varying types (small indels versus point mutations).
Postanalytical Variables
Postanalysis is as important to consider in validation as
preanalytical and analytical variables. For single-gene
assays, the software used in analysis should be validated,
with verification of updates. If NGS is used, the bioinfor-
matics pipeline should be thoroughly and rigorously
validated, include potential problematic mutations (eg, large
indels), and be verified or revalidated for new upgrades as
applicable to the change. Any analysis should be performed
on validation specimens as it would be for clinical
specimens.
Reporting format should also be considered and decided
during validation. Interpretation comments for inclusion in
the patient report to ensure that the reports are correctly
understood should be developed during the validation
process.112 Human Genome Organisation (HUGO)–based
nomenclature should be used for reports and a designated
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
transcript number (NM_##) should be used within the
validation and report.116 For multigene panels based on
NGS, reporting protocols and any used software should be
included in the validation procedure. Databases and
annotation guidelines should be discussed and included in
the validation as one prepares to report variants based on
NGS data. In addition, decisions should be made during the
validation process as to whether normal tissue will be tested
to assist in variant interpretation with NGS.
In conclusion, validation of assays used in CRC molecular
testing is extremely important for accuracy of reporting and
proper patient care. There are several documents (eg, CLIA,
CAP, and CLSI)111–113,115 available to assist in proper
validation, which should be consulted to validate according
to best laboratory practices.
11. Strong Recommendation.—Laboratories must vali-
date the performance of IHC testing for colorectal carcino-
ma molecular biomarkers (currently IHC testing for MLH1,
MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) in accordance with best
laboratory practices.
Four proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) are
currently considered important in the normal biochemistry
of DNA MMR.117–119 As detailed in recommendation 2b,
altered DNA mismatch repair proteins due to mutation or
epigenetic silencing result in interference with normal MMR
protein heterodimerization and loss of normal repair of
mispaired bases and short insertions/deletions, resulting in
MSI,119,120 overall categorized as dMMR. Loss of MMR
function usually correlates with loss of protein expression,
such that immunohistochemical testing for MMR proteins is
optimized to detect loss of MMR protein expression in
tumor cell nuclei. Each of these four proteins can be
detected in paraffin sections using commercially available
primary and secondary antibodies, standardized antigen
retrieval, and 3,3"-diaminobenzidine chromogen detection.
Development of anti-MMR protein antibody staining
protocols follows a standard approach that involves (1)
demonstration of absent background noise with secondary
antibody alone and (2) empirical optimization of the signal-
to-noise ratio by testing different antibody concentrations,
antigen retrieval buffers, and reaction conditions, taking
advantage of internal control cells, including lymphocytes,
stromal cells, and other nonneoplastic nuclei.
Validation of the final staining protocol is required prior to
implementation for clinical use. Peer-reviewed literature-
based guidelines for validation and revalidation of immu-
nohistochemical tests have been defined as 14 recommen-
dations and expert consensus opinions.121 Concordance
with internal or external known comparator tests is required
to exceed 90%. Proficiency testing is a good approach to
confirm interlaboratory test reproducibility. Test result
concordance across laboratories implies accuracy of partic-
ipant laboratory diagnosis.
Once the protocol is defined and validated for a given
primary antibody clone and antigen retrieval conditions, a
known positive external control (eg, tonsil) is routinely run
Arch Pathol Lab Med
ASCP/CAP/AMP/ASCO CRC Biomarker Guideline—Sepulveda et al
23
 in parallel with each unknown. This demonstrates that the
MMR protein was detectable on that staining run and allows
trust in a loss of expression result in the unknown specimen.
Each of the four MMR proteins is expressed in nonneo-
plastic tissue, in most lymphocytes, and overexpressed in
germinal centers, such that most colon block sections will
also have positive internal control staining.
Overall, validated immunohistochemical detection of
MMR proteins is a trustworthy method for identification
of loss of expression of individual MMR proteins in paraffin
sections of CRC. In most CRCs with high-level microsat-
ellite instability (MSI-H), the loss of DNA MMR protein
expression in tumor cell nuclei by immunohistochemical
detection is uniform throughout the tumor.122,123 Rare cases
of MSI tumors have been reported to show heterogeneous
staining.124 Loss of MMR protein expression usually
correlates with MSI, particularly for MSI-H tumors, and is
indicative of dMMR. If MSH2 or MLH1 shows loss of
expression due to loss of function, then their heterodimer
partners (MSH6 and PMS2, respectively) will also not be
expressed. In contrast, inactivation of MSH6 or PMS2
results in loss of expression of the individual MMR protein
MSH6 or PMS2, respectively.
Although loss of MMR protein immunoreactivity is
generally detected in dMMR CRC, normal immunoreactivity
can be seen in up to 10% of dMMR cases125; therefore, MSI
DNA testing may be performed either stepwise or as a
concurrent test.
12. Expert Consensus Opinion.—Laboratories must
provide clinically appropriate turnaround times and optimal
utilization of tissue specimens by using appropriate tech-
niques (eg, multiplexed assays) for clinically relevant
molecular and immunohistochemical biomarkers of CRC.
Expediency in reporting of biomarker results for colorectal
tumors is dictated primarily by two factors: need for patient
management decisions and, more generally, patient anxiety.
Consequently, results of such evaluations should be
available within a timeframe for the involved clinician to
relay this information to the patient. This need is
compounded by the patient’s need to receive a complete
understanding of his or her diagnosis and treatment plans
going forward. A reasonable benchmark is that nonacute
biomarker results be available to the treating physician
within 10 working days of receipt in the molecular
diagnostics laboratory. This turnaround time has been
recommended in other guidelines for molecular tumor
testing.105,126,127 Ideally, the transitional time between test
ordering, tissue block selection, block retrieval, and ship-
ment to the performing laboratory should be included in the
10-day timeframe. Consequently, laboratories should make
every effort to minimize delays in securing appropriate
tissue blocks for testing. Testing laboratories should make
every effort to minimize processing time and return of
results.
The availability of tumor tissue for biomarker evaluation is
generally not limiting in most cases of resected CRC.
Occasionally, following neoadjuvant therapy, the amount of
residual tumor in resection specimens can be very small and
focal. Similarly, the amount of tumor tissue obtained by
biopsy or fine-needle aspiration procedures from primary or
metastatic foci can be very small and challenging to test for
the desired biomarkers. In such circumstances, available
tissue blocks should be sectioned judiciously, reserving
sufficient sections for testing by molecular methods or
immunohistochemical techniques, as deemed appropriate to
secure as accurate and informative an evaluation as possible.
Test turnaround times for RAS testing in instances of
advanced stage tumors are dictated by the need to select and
initiate appropriate chemotherapy options. Ideally, such
information should be available either at the time of
postoperative oncology evaluation, where decisions regard-
ing therapeutic options are entertained, or at the tumor
boards where patient treatment options are discussed. In
some institutions, these discussions may occur in the week
following surgery or biopsy and probably no later than in
the second week following tissue diagnosis and staging.
Here, too, a timeframe of no more than 10 days would seem
an appropriate benchmark for biomarker result availability.
In exceptional circumstances, even shorter test turn-
around times may be appropriate. Occasional patients have
histories sufficiently suggestive of Lynch syndrome that
prompt consideration and discussion regarding extent of
surgery (ie, complete colectomy or prophylactic hysterecto-
my in select affected patients). Efforts should be made in
such circumstances to obtain appropriate test results as
rapidly as possible to allow for informed decision making.
MMR immunohistochemistry can be performed and report-
ed with a turnaround time of 48 hours or less, and in the
appropriate clinical context, a result of preserved expression
of MMR proteins would argue against Lynch syndrome.
Conversely, any loss of MMR protein expression will need to
be integrated with additional clinical information, family
history, and further testing such as BRAF mutation, MLH1
methylation testing, and potential germline genetic testing.
Furthermore, DNA MMR status, performed by MMR
immunohistochemistry or by MSI DNA tests, as a good
prognostic biomarker for CRC overall, should be available
within the recommended 10 working day turnaround time
for test results.
13. Expert Consensus Opinion.—Molecular and IHC
biomarker testing in colorectal carcinoma should be
initiated in a timely fashion based on the clinical scenario
and in accordance with institutionally accepted practices.
Note: Test ordering can occur on a case-by-case basis or by
policies established by the medical staff.
Molecular and IHC biomarker testing is increasingly being
used in patient management. Prognostic biomarkers are
being used for early stage disease to guide decisions on the
use of adjuvant chemotherapy. Such discussions require the
availability of tests in a timely manner, and delays in
initiation of therapy have been associated with worse
outcomes.127 Predictive biomarkers, such as those for EGFR
monoclonal antibody therapy, should be initiated in a timely
fashion to guide chemotherapy options and long-term
treatment planning. Institutional policies and practices that
encourage the rapid initiation of appropriate molecular and
IHC marker testing should be encouraged. Such policies
may include reflexive ordering of molecular and IHC
markers as guided by the clinical scenario and incorporation
of testing initiation by multiple members of the multidis-
ciplinary team, as noted in recommendation 15.
14. Expert Consensus Opinion.—Laboratories should
establish policies to ensure efficient allocation and utiliza-
tion of tissue for molecular testing, particularly in small
specimens.
The number of molecular and immunohistochemical tests
becoming available that have a direct benefit to patient care
will continue to increase. Most of these tests are performed
on FFPE specimens, the most common preservation
24
Arch Pathol Lab Med
ASCP/CAP/AMP/ASCO CRC Biomarker Guideline—Sepulveda et al
 technique, including pretreatment and posttreatment biop-
sies and resections (Table 13). Tissues from patients with
cancer should be processed according to established
laboratory protocols, which include quality controls of
preservation materials, tissue dissection, time to fixation,
fixation time, and processing.
Laboratory protocols need to include procedures for
handling small samples such as endoscopic or core biopsy
specimens and fine-needle aspirate samples of metastatic
lesions (eg, from liver or lung). Limiting the number of
tissue fragments per individual cassette is encouraged.
Established protocols may allow upfront ordering of
required tissue sections (eg, extra unstained slides), which
limit tissue wasting and improve turnaround time of final
results. Immunohistochemistry studies, if needed to diag-
nose metastatic CRC, should be limited in scope and
standardized to preserve tissues.
It is imperative to identify suspected metastatic CRC
specimens at specimen accessioning to limit unneeded
ancillary tests, such as liver biopsy special stains. Recogni-
tion of previous CRC diagnoses from the patient clinical
history should limit the need for immunohistochemistry
profiles in many cases. Established laboratory procedures to
identify patients undergoing cancer biopsy or fine-needle
aspiration specifically for predictive molecular biomarker
assessments need to be in place.
Laboratories must maintain appropriate cataloguing and
storage of tissue specimens and diagnostic slides to allow for
retrospective timely testing of cancer samples.
This recommendation is supported by 15 studies,128–142
comprising eight prospective cohort studies130–133,136–138,142
and seven retrospective cohort studies.128,129,134,135,139–141
For the eight prospective cohort studies,130–133,136–138,142 all
reported balance between the treatment and assessment
groups, as all but one132 used a single cohort design allowing
for within-group comparisons. Only this single study,
reported by Tol et al,132 would have required making
adjustments for imbalances between the treatment and
assessment groups, but none were needed. Five stud-
ies130,133,136–138 reported nonindustry funding, one132 report-
ed at least partial industry funding, one142 reported industry
funding, and one131 did not disclose the source of funding, if
any. Seven130,131,133,136–138,142 were deemed to have a low risk
of bias, and one132 was deemed to have a low to moderate
risk of bias.
For
the
se ven
retrospectiv e
cohort
stud-
ies,128,129,134,135,139–141 all used a single cohort design allowing
for within-group comparisons. Four reported nonindustry
funding,134,135,139,140 one reported industry funding,129 and
two did not disclose the source of funding, if any.128,141 Six
were deemed to have a low risk of bias,128,134,135,139–141 and
one was deemed to have a moderate risk of bias.129
All of the evidence that supported this recommendation
was assessed, and none had methodologic flaws that would
raise concerns about their findings.
15. Expert Consensus Opinion.—Members of the
patient’s medical team, including pathologists, may initiate
colorectal carcinoma molecular biomarker test orders in
accordance with institutionally accepted practices.
For patients with CRC, timely diagnosis or therapeutic
initiation is critical, and molecular testing that is to be
considered should be ordered as efficiently as possible in
accordance with institutional practices and guidelines. MSI
testing is often ordered at the time of diagnosis to identify
patients with Lynch syndrome, direct adjuvant chemother-
apy, or determine prognosis. Many institutions employ
algorithms to ensure that all colorectal cancers are evaluated
for MMR deficiency, and these are often initiated by
pathologists when the diagnosis occurs after joint general
process approval by pathologists, oncologists, and other
members of the patient medical team. Molecular testing that
is performed to direct targeted therapy (eg, RAS) may be
ordered at a later date than the primary diagnosis, at
metastatic presentation, for example, and so institutions
may differ as to whether one should order such testing
upfront on the primary diagnostic biopsy or resection
specimen or wait until metastatic disease arises requiring
targeted therapy. Often oncologists order predictive molec-
ular assays since they are used to direct therapy, but this
should not necessarily be limited to oncologists, as
pathologists serve as important stewards of the tissue and
make the tumor diagnosis. There are also issues to consider,
including logistical issues, cost-effectiveness, patient access
to molecular testing in rural or underserved areas, and even
heterogeneity considerations between primary and meta-
static tumor. Since each institution differs in patient
population, facilities, departmental organization, regulatory
and reimbursement climates, and practitioner preference,
whether to submit testing at initial diagnosis of a primary
lesion or when a metastatic lesion arises should be discussed
collaboratively between oncologists, pathologists, and med-
ical executive or hospital committees as applicable.
‘‘Reflex’’ testing, a testing policy that does not require a
separate clinician order for each case, is appropriate if
agreed upon by the CRC care team as an institutionally
approved standing order and may help to ensure expedited
and consistent routing of specimens for molecular testing.
However, some patients may not be candidates for targeted
therapy for clinical reasons, and good communication
between the clinical care team and the testing laboratory
is needed to ensure testing is performed for patients whose
management will be affected by the test result. Specifically,
testing is not necessary for patients with stage IV disease
who are being considered for palliative or hospice care only.
Similarly, in settings in which reflex testing is the practice, a
mechanism should be provided for the clinical care team to
communicate to the pathologist examining a small biopsy or
cytology sample when a more suitable diagnostic specimen
(eg, a resection) is expected to be obtained, and the
molecular testing should be deferred to the subsequent,
more generous sample. All reflex testing should be
approved institutionally by the hospital or institution’s
medical executive committee as local policies dictate.
16. Expert Consensus Opinion.—Laboratories that
require send out of tests for treatment predictive biomarkers
should process and send colorectal carcinoma specimens to
reference molecular laboratories in a timely manner.
Note: It is suggested that a benchmark of 90% of
specimens should be sent out within 3 working days.
It is critical to provide the results of molecular tests in a
timely fashion to start the most appropriate cancer
treatment option for each patient. Delays in initiation of
therapy have been associated with worse outcomes.127 To
date, laboratories have had limited guidance on the
recommended timing or turnaround time of molecular test
results, and studies addressing the impact of specific
turnaround times have not been conducted. Therefore, the
panel reached an expert consensus opinion, based on each
panel member’s practical experience in the laboratory and
clinical setting.
Arch Pathol Lab Med
ASCP/CAP/AMP/ASCO CRC Biomarker Guideline—Sepulveda et al
25
 For laboratories that do not perform molecular testing
and/or biomarker immunohistochemistry for CRC therapy
selection, the consensus opinion was that send out of
specimens should occur within 3 working days, starting
from the day the test order was received in the laboratory,
provided the specimens (eg, biopsy or resection specimens)
are received at the same time of the test order or specimens
are already in the laboratory (eg, archived paraffin blocks).
The underlying rationale stems from the usual workflow for
tissue processing. In practice, the longest process would be
the processing of large surgical specimens, such as
colectomies. A possible approach is to obtain a designated
molecular tissue block at the time of specimen grossing, and
molecular protocols for obtaining tissue sections may be
used to have the necessary sections for test send-out in a
timely fashion by the third working day for most cases.
Another scenario may be the retrieval of archived tissue
paraffin blocks that may be stored outside of the laboratory
location. In this case, a protocol for block retrieval for
molecular testing may be operationalized to streamline the
process and reach the desired turnaround time for send-out.
This turnaround time of 3 working days was also
recommended for RAS testing of colorectal carcinoma in
the guidance document from the Association of Clinical
Pathologists Molecular Pathology and Diagnostics Group in
the United Kingdom.126
Laboratories should develop written policies as part of
their quality assurance program to monitor turnaround
times for all cancer therapeutic and prognostic biomarkers.
17. Expert Consensus Opinion.—Pathologists must
evaluate candidate specimens for biomarker testing to
ensure specimen adequacy, taking into account tissue
quality, quantity, and malignant tumor cell fraction.
Specimen adequacy findings should be documented in the
patient report.
It is critical that pathologists selecting blocks for
biomarker testing understand the specimen requirements
of the method being employed in terms of total tissue
amount (a reflection of the total amount of DNA required
for the assays) and the fraction of malignant tumor cells in
the specimen focus to be evaluated. The total amount of
tissue selected for evaluation is significant in two respects.
First, the amount of tissue sampled should be of sufficient
quantity to produce a result that is reliably representative of
the entire tumor. While recent evidence indicates that some
genes continue to evolve during tumor progression, leading
to substantial tumor genetic heterogeneity, those driver
mutations of importance to CRC are usually, but not always,
homogeneous throughout the tumor. The amount of tumor
necessary, however, for a particular analytical method can
vary and demands knowledge and due attention to the
indicated tissue requirements for the specific assay em-
ployed. The minimal required proportion of tumor DNA in a
sample from cancer is dictated by the analytical sensitivity of
the particular validated assay. As shown in Table 13, the
amount of tumor used in the analyses of KRAS mutations in
several studies comparing the test-performing characteris-
tics of various assays varied widely, ranging from 1% to
90%.
The proportion of malignant tumor cells (as opposed to
tumor-associated nonmalignant cells, eg, stromal fibro-
blasts, endothelial cells, infiltrating inflammatory cells)
should be evaluated as accurately as possible and docu-
mented. This evaluation is most readily performed by
estimating the proportion of malignant cell nuclei to
nonmalignant cell nuclei within the focus selected for
evaluation.143 Understanding that the number of mutated
alleles for a particular gene may represent as few as half of
the alleles in diploid tumor cells, a tumor cell focus with a
nominal proportion of 50% tumor cells would have a
mutant allele fraction of 25%, a value approaching the
analytical sensitivity of some molecular assays. So, while a
variety of molecular methods can be used to evaluate tissue
specimens, it is critical that these be carefully matched to
their specific tissue and tumor cell proportion requirements.
When adhered to, all of these methods can produce accurate
and reliable results.
Pathologists evaluating tissue section for biomarker
evaluation should also be aware that necrosis and tissue
degeneration can lead to erroneous results, and foci
demonstrating significant necrosis should be avoided for
molecular testing. Any amount of necrosis in the sample
selected for biomarker testing should be estimated and
documented.
18. Expert Consensus Opinion.—Laboratories should
use colorectal carcinoma molecular biomarker testing
methods that are able to detect mutations in specimens
with at least 5% mutant allele frequency, taking into account
the analytical sensitivity of the assay (limit of detection or
LOD) and tumor enrichment (eg, microdissection).
Note: It is recommended that the operational minimal
neoplastic carcinoma cell content tested should be set at
least two times the assay’s LOD.
Since the accuracy and results of testing for molecular
markers are dependent on both tumor cell content and the
assay-specific sensitivity in the identification of a mutant
allele against a background of wild-type/nonmutated alleles,
it is suggested that laboratories should establish minimum
acceptable tumor cell content as a component of their
specimen requirements. It is recommended that a pathol-
ogist reviews all cases for tumor cell content and quality.
Due to the stochastic nature of mutant allele identification at
the lower LOD, it is recommended that the minimal tumor
cell content be at least two times the lower LOD of a
validated molecular method or assay. This LOD was also
recommended for RAS testing of colorectal carcinoma in the
guidance document from the United Kingdom.126 Hence, if
a particular assay has a lower limit of mutant allele detection
of 5%, then the minimum tumor cell content in samples
analyzed by this assay should be at least 10% to reliably
detect heterozygous mutations in those neoplasms. Due to
intratumoral heterogeneity, subclones, and the nature of
tissue sampling, clinical trials have used 5% as the lower
LOD, and for clinical purposes, it is recommended that the
lower LOD for a mutant allele be at least 5%.12 Therefore,
the utilization of methods such as PCR, HRM, single-strand
conformation polymorphism, pyrosequencing, or commer-
cially available kits that achieve this level of sensitivity is
recommended130,137,138,142 (Table 13).
This recommendation is supported by four prospective
cohort studies130,137,138,142 and two retrospective cohort
studies.102,144 The four prospective cohort studies all studied
a single cohort, allowing for within-group comparisons. For
this reason, all were balanced between comparison groups,
and no adjustments were needed to account for baseline
differences. All four reported nonindustry funding, and all
were deemed to have a low risk of bias.
The two retrospective cohort studies102,144 also used single
cohorts, allowing for within-group comparisons only.
One102 did not report the source of funding, while the
26
Arch Pathol Lab Med
ASCP/CAP/AMP/ASCO CRC Biomarker Guideline—Sepulveda et al
 other144 reported nonindustry funding. Both were deemed
to have a low risk of bias.
None of the studies had methodologic flaws that would
raise concerns about their findings.
19. Expert Consensus Opinion.—Colorectal carcinoma
molecular biomarker results should be made available as
promptly as feasible to inform therapeutic decision making,
both prognostic and predictive.
Note: It is suggested that a benchmark of 90% of reports
be available within 10 working days from date of receipt in
the molecular diagnostics laboratory.
Combined chemotherapy, including anti-EGFR therapy,
in patients with CRC in the absence of mutations in the
EGFR signaling pathway is associated with significant
survival advantage. No significant therapeutic benefit is
derived from anti-EGFR therapy in the presence of
mutations in KRAS and NRAS.44 The presence of deficient
MMR in stage II CRC indicates a good prognosis and
identifies patients for whom adjuvant 5-fluorouracil mono-
based therapies have no significant benefit.145,146 The
presence of deficient MMR or BRAF p.V600E mutation in
proficient MMR CRCs has important prognostic signifi-
cance.54
In the absence of published data establishing an evidence-
based recommendation, it is our expert consensus opinion
that the above results, regardless of testing methods, be
available from test ordering in the initial diagnostic
pathology laboratory to the clinical team within 2 weeks
(10 working days). The 10 working days does not include
the time before the tissue specimen is available for testing
(ie, from diagnostic procedure to receipt in laboratory) or
time to retrieve tissue samples from an outside laboratory.
Laboratories unable to maintain this standard, either
through in-house testing or use of a reference laboratory,
need to implement measures to improve test result
turnaround time. A turnaround time of 7 working days
was recommended for RAS testing of colorectal carcinoma
in the guidance document from the Association of Clinical
Pathologists Molecular Pathology and Diagnostics Group in
the United Kingdom.126
This recommendation is supported by evidence from one
randomized controlled trial, reported by Douillard et al.44
This report used prospective patient data collected within
the PRIME trial. While it did not report details on the
randomization, blinding, statistical power calculation, sam-
ple size, or length of follow-up, it did report on baseline
characteristics and was otherwise well reported. Funding
was reported to be partially from industry sources. Overall,
this trial was found to have a low to moderate risk of bias
and did not have methodologic flaws that would raise
concerns about its findings.
Each laboratory should develop a quality assurance
program to monitor turnaround times for all cancer
therapeutic and prognostic biomarkers.
20. Expert Consensus Opinion.—Colorectal carcinoma
molecular biomarker testing reports should include a results
and interpretation section readily understandable by oncol-
ogists and pathologists. Appropriate Human Genome
Variation Society (HGVS) and HUGO nomenclature must
be used in conjunction with any historical genetic designa-
tions.
Reporting of molecular results is becoming more complex
as new information and clinical utility are discovered for
somatic variants. Single-gene assays are still being widely
used, but multiplexing has allowed for multiple possible
results. With the introduction of NGS into the clinical
setting, multiple somatic mutations with clinical significance
may be identified. However, panel assays by NGS can also
reveal variants with unknown clinical significance. As
pathogenic genes and somatic mutations have been
discovered during the past 30 years, there has been
divergent nomenclature employed, making clinical report-
ing and clinical analysis difficult. Presently and in the future,
as national databases are constructed annotating clinical
somatic variants, it is imperative that standardized nomen-
clature be employed to identify the clinical significance of
rare variants.
Clinicians want a report that is easily readable and
understandable but that gives pertinent clinical information
concisely, accurately, and thoroughly. Reported variants
should be identified using both DNA and protein nomen-
clature. Citing codon positivity only is not encouraged (eg,
positive for a KRAS codon 12 mutation). The specific
mutation should be explained using standardized nomen-
clature, preferably HUGO gene nomenclature.112,147 Histor-
ical designations (eg, historical HER-2/neu, for HUGO
ERBB2) should also be included as appropriate in the report
to avoid confusion among oncologists. Importantly, the
messenger RNA transcript number (NM_#) from the NCBI,
used to designate the specific codon numbering, should be
named in the report since numbering can differ between the
different/alternative transcript designations for the same
gene. If using NGS, variants should at least be classified as
pathogenic, likely pathogenic, variant of unknown signifi-
cance, likely benign, or benign, but classification of somatic
mutations is still awaiting specifically approved guide-
lines.148 However, a numerical classification scheme for
somatic variants has been proposed, taking into consider-
ation actionability of the variant in the patient’s tumor type
versus other tumor types, predicted pathogenicity (using
programs such as SIFT and PolyPhen 2) in the patient’s
tumor type versus other tumor types, variant recurrence in a
certain cancer type, or unknown significance.149 Such a
classification scheme may be better suited to somatic
variants considering the indications for which most of these
assays are being ordered.
Reports should contain the analytical result, the method
used, and information about the genes and loci tested or
included in the assay; the assay limit of detection; and any
required disclaimers (eg, ASR) that are required to meet
regulations. When reasonable and applicable, an interpre-
tive comment should be given to ensure that results are
correctly understood.112 Such an interpretive comment may
include information regarding therapeutic implications,
prognostic implications, and/or pathogenic significance of
the mutation and, when appropriate or desired, potential
applicable clinical trials.
In summary, molecular reports should be easily under-
standable by clinical oncologists and use standardized
nomenclature outlined by HGVS/HUGO. All reports should
contain the elements of result, interpretation, variant
classification, and information as applicable; limit of
detection of the assay and methods to assist the oncologist
in understanding the test result; and limitations as they
consider the result in a clinical context.
21. Strong Recommendation.—Laboratories must in-
corporate colorectal carcinoma molecular biomarker testing
methods into their overall laboratory quality improvement
program, establishing appropriate quality improvement
monitors as needed to ensure consistent performance in
Arch Pathol Lab Med
ASCP/CAP/AMP/ASCO CRC Biomarker Guideline—Sepulveda et al
27
 all steps of the testing and reporting process. In particular,
laboratories performing colorectal carcinoma molecular
biomarker testing must participate in formal proficiency
testing programs, if available, or an alternative proficiency
assurance activity.
Proficiency testing (PT) is an important component of
quality assurance for laboratory tests in general and applies
to the molecular tests discussed in the current CRC
molecular testing guidelines. These include mutational as
well as immunohistochemical testing. Participation in PT
allows the assessment and comparison of test performance
among different clinical laboratories and technologies and
allows verification of accuracy and reliability of laboratory
tests.150
From a regulatory standpoint, PT in the United States is a
requirement for accreditation by the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services. Participation in PT may be done through
CAP PT programs or through other providers accepted by
CLIA.151 Other countries—namely, the United Kingdom—
follow similar guidelines, recommending that laboratories
providing RAS testing of CRC should demonstrate success-
ful participation in a relevant external quality assurance
scheme and be appropriately accredited.126
Formal external proficiency testing programs for analytes
other than KRAS, MSI, MMR, and BRAF may not be
available at the time of this publication. Alternative
proficiency testing activities should be used. Appropriate
alternative performance assessment procedures may include
split sample analysis with other laboratories or, if that is not
available, assessment of split samples with an established
in-house method and previously assayed material, which
are run and interpreted by laboratory personnel who do not
have access to the prior results.151 If exchanging specimens
with other laboratories is the laboratory proficiency ap-
proach, this should be done with one or more other
laboratories at least twice per year.105 Methods-based
proficiency testing (MBPT) refers to a testing approach that
is based on method, rather than based on each individual
analyte tested. MBPT is well established for several
pathology subspecialty areas, and the concept of MBPT
complies with federal laboratory regulations.151
DISCUSSION ON EMERGING BIOMARKERS
Numerous studies have reported potential molecular
biomarkers for CRC prognosis, while fewer studies evalu-
ated markers that could be predictive of response to specific
treatments. Many published studies are limited due to early
exploratory and retrospective analyses, and those biomark-
ers, while of potential interest, have not made it to clinical
practice. Our systematic review identified several CRC
molecular biomarkers that showed either prognostic or
treatment predictive characteristics in single studies (Sup-
plemental Table 15). Most of the molecular biomarkers
reported in the studies listed in the Supplemental Table 15
were
tested
for
expression
by
immunohistochemistry.
Immunohistochemistry is notable for its widespread avail-
ability in pathology laboratories but has limited quantitative
capabilities due to difficult standardization of quantitative or
semiquantitative scoring, and is fraught by significant
interobserver variability. A problem of quantitative assays,
such
as
gene
expression,
microRNA
expression,
and
methylation levels, tested in solid tumors, results from the
intrinsic
mixed
nature
of
the
tissue
with
significant
variability of tumor and nontumor tissue content. Another
limitation of molecular biomarker discovery approaches that
rely on expression levels is that these biomarkers have not
been evaluated in the context of complex molecular
regulation of individual cancer subtypes. Their fruitful use
in the clinic may require further studies that take into
account computational predictions of biological behavior
and validation in prospective cohorts.
A great deal of interest has been raised recently for
noninvasive prognostic and/or therapy-predictive molecular
biomarkers, such as those tested in circulating tumor cells or
circulating nucleic acids, either as free nucleic acid in serum
or associated with extracellular vesicles or exosomes. This
has been referred to as ‘‘liquid biopsy.’’152 Liquid biopsies
may be particularly useful in the management of patients
with CRC to identify recurrence, RAS mutation testing for
emergence of treatment resistance associated with anti-
EGFR therapy, and potential early cancer detection in
defined subpopulations, such as those at high risk of CRC.
Overall, molecular biomarkers for colorectal cancer tested in
liquid biopsy samples are promising but await further
validation.
Emerging data indicate that MMR status may have
predictive value in some settings, specifically in patients
with advanced disease being considered for anti-PD-1/PD-
L1 therapy.68,69
CONCLUSIONS
Evidence supports mutational testing of specific genes in
the EGFR signaling pathway, since they provide clinically
actionable information for targeted therapy of CRC with
anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. Mutations in some of the
biomarkers have clear prognostic value (BRAF, MMR), and
at least two (KRAS and NRAS) have relatively strong
evidence as negative predictors of benefit to anti-EGFR
therapies and should be used to guide the use of these
agents. BRAF mutations are consistently associated with
poor outcomes in patients with metastatic CRC, including
those who relapse after adjuvant therapy. Patients with
localized colon cancer and dMMR have improved outcomes.
Emerging data suggest that MMR status has predictive value
in some settings, specifically in patients with advanced
disease being considered for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.
Laboratory approaches to operationalize molecular testing
for predictive and prognostic molecular biomarkers involve
selection of assays, type of specimens to be tested, timing of
ordering of tests, and turnaround time for testing results. A
number of alternative technical approaches can effectively
be used as long as test specificity and sensitivity meet the
clinical needs. While earlier testing approaches were focused
on one or a few testing targets (eg, BRAF p.V600 mutations),
new approaches are currently using gene panels such as
targeted NGS cancer panels, which can range from a few to
hundreds of genes and amplicons with known mutational
hotspots in cancer.
These guidelines will be subjected to regular updates, such
that new advances in the field can be captured and
integrated in the guidelines in a timely manner.
