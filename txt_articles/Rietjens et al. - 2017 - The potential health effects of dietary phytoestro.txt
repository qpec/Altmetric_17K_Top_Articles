Phytoestrogens are plant-derived dietary compounds with structural similarity to 17-β-oestradiol (E2), the primary female sex
hormone. This structural similarity to E2 enables phytoestrogens to cause (anti)oestrogenic effects by binding to the oestrogen
receptors. The aim of the present review is to present a state-of-the-art overview of the potential health effects of dietary
phytoestrogens. Various beneficial health effects have been ascribed to phytoestrogens, such as a lowered risk of menopausal
symptoms like hot flushes and osteoporosis, lowered risks of cardiovascular disease, obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2
diabetes, brain function disorders, breast cancer, prostate cancer, bowel cancer and other cancers. In contrast to these beneficial
health claims, the (anti)oestrogenic properties of phytoestrogens have also raised concerns since they might act as endocrine
disruptors, indicating a potential to cause adverse health effects. The literature overview presented in this paper illustrates that
several potential health benefits of phytoestrogens have been reported but that, given the data on potential adverse health
effects, the current evidence on these beneficial health effects is not so obvious that they clearly outweigh the possible health risks.
Furthermore, the data currently available are not sufficient to support a more refined (semi) quantitative risk–benefit analysis. This
implies that a definite conclusion on possible beneficial health effects of phytoestrogens cannot be made.

 Introduction
Phytoestrogens are plant-derived dietary compounds, found
in a wide variety of foods, especially in soy. They represent a
diverse group of naturally occurring chemicals with struc-
tural similarity to 17-β-oestradiol (E2), the primary female
sex hormone. Because the lack of phytoestrogens in the diet
does not result in deficiency syndromes and because the
phytoestrogens do not participate in any essential biological
function, phytoestrogens are not considered nutrients. Their
structural similarity to E2 enables them to cause (anti)
oestrogenic effects by binding to the oestrogen receptors
(ERs). This was already noticed in the previous century in
Western Australia where sheep grazing on isoflavone-rich
red clover fields showed fertility problems (Bennetts et al.,
1946; Stafford, 1997; Scherr et al., 2009). It has been hypoth-
esized that plants use phytoestrogens as part of their natural
defence to control female fertility to prevent overpopulation
and overgrazing by herbivore animals (Hughes, 1988). In line
with this, Setchell (Setchell, 1998) suggested that the fertility
problems of zoo animals could be related to the presence of
soy isoflavone phytoestrogens in the standard animal diet.
Besides these adverse effects, various beneficial health effects
have been ascribed to phytoestrogens, such as a lowered risk
of menopausal symptoms like hot flushes and osteoporosis.
As a result, phytoestrogens are present in a large number of
dietary
supplements
and
widely
marketed
as
natural
alternatives to oestrogen replacement therapy. In addition,
phytoestrogen exposure has been related to lowered risks of
cardiovascular disease, obesity, metabolic syndrome and type
2 diabetes, brain function disorders, breast cancer and other
forms of cancer including prostate cancer, bowel cancer and
other cancers (Hughes, 1988; Adlercreutz, 2002; Bhathena
and Velasquez, 2002; Karahalil, 2005; Cederroth and Nef,
2009; Patisaul and Jefferson, 2010; Zhao and Mu, 2011;
Jungbauer and Medjakovic, 2014).
In
the
last
decades,
soy
isoflavones
have
received
attention because of the so called ‘Japanese Phenomenon’
connected to a lower incidence of specific chronic diseases
in the Japanese compared with the Western population due
to a higher intake of soy foods from early life onwards
(Watanabe et al., 2002; Korde et al., 2004; Korde et al.,
2009). The fact that the prevalence of breast cancer in daugh-
ters of migrated Japanese Americans became similar to that of
Caucasian Americans after changing their food habits is in
line with this observation.
In contrast to these beneficial health claims, the (anti)
oestrogenic properties of phytoestrogens have also raised
concerns since they might act as endocrine disruptors, indi-
cating a potential to cause adverse health effects. Altogether,
the
health
benefits
or
risks
of
isoflavones
and
other
phytoestrogens are still controversial (Wuttke et al., 2007;
Andres et al., 2011; Rietjens et al., 2013), and the question of
whether phytoestrogens are beneficial or harmful to human
health remains unresolved.
Keeping that in mind, the aim of the present review is to
present a state-of-the-art overview of the potential health
effects of dietary phytoestrogens. The paper presents an
overview of the different phytoestrogens present in the diet
and food supplements, their supposed mode(s) of action
and recent evidence on their supposed beneficial effects.
To obtain an overview of the various health effects, we
searched Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed for entries with
the search terms ‘phytoestrogen(s)’, ‘review’, ‘meta-analysis’
and the respective health effects in titles, abstracts and
keywords.
Phytoestrogens in the diet
Figure 1 presents an overview of the major types of
phytoestrogens known to be present in the diet and food sup-
plements, also including their chemical structure compared
with that of E2. The major groups of phytoestrogens present
in our diet are isoflavones, prenylflavonoids, coumestans
and lignans. The main isoflavones are genistein, daidzein,
glycitein, formononetin and biochanin A, which are mainly
found in soy, soy-based food and legumes usually in their
conjugated forms like genistin, daidzin, puerarin, glycitin,
ononin and sissotrin. In countries in Asia where fermented
soy products are part of the traditional diet, isoflavone intake
levels may amount to about 15–50 mg isoflavones per day
(Eisenbrand et al., 2007). In Western industrial countries, iso-
flavone intake has been reported to be less than 2 mg
isoflavones per day (Eisenbrand et al., 2007), although it
may be higher for menopausal women who take soy-based
preparations as an alternative to hormone replacement ther-
apy. The dosages recommended by the manufacturers may
vary with the product, and have been reported to amount to
values between 20 and 80 mg isoflavones per day (Eisenbrand
et al., 2007).
Major prenylflavonoids are 6-prenylnaringenin, 6-ger-
anylnaringenin, 8-prenylnaringenin and isoxanthohumol,

 which can all be found in hops and beer (Stevens and
Page, 2004; Dhooghe et al., 2010). Of the prenylflavonoids,
8-prenylnaringenin (Figure 1) is the most potent phytoestro-
gen known. The main coumestans are coumestrol, 4′-
methoxycoumestrol, repensol and trifoliol (Figure 1). Food
sources high in coumestans include split peas, pinto beans,
lima beans, and especially, alfalfa and clover sprouts. Lignans
that are classified as phytoestrogens are enterodiol and
enterolactone (Figure 1), which are formed from lignan pre-
cursors by intestinal bacteria (Lampe, 2003). Lignan precur-
sors include pinoresinol, lariciresinol, secoisolariciresinol,
matairesinol and others (Figure 2). Lignan precursors are
found in a wide variety of foods, including flaxseeds, whole
grains, fruits and vegetables, sesame seeds and legumes and
present a principal source of dietary phytoestrogens in the
Western diet (de Kleijn et al., 2002; Valsta et al., 2003).
Mode(s) of action: interaction with oestrogen
receptors
The major mode of action by which phytoestogens may exert
their possible health effects, is based on their structural simi-
larity to E2 enabling them to cause (anti)oestrogenic effects
by binding to the ER. Two main ERs, that is oestrogen recep-
tor α (ERα) (NR3A1) and oestrogen receptor β (ERβ) (NR3A2),
have been identified in rats, mice, primates and humans
(Kuiper et al., 1996; Ogawa et al., 1998). These ER subtypes
have different roles in gene regulation, cancer biology and
therapy (Nilsson et al., 2001; Williams et al., 2008; Thomas
and Gustafsson, 2011). ERα activation in breast and uterus
has been shown to enhance cell proliferation, necessary for
growth and tissue maintenance (Pearce and Jordan, 2004;
Harris, 2007; Thomas and Gustafsson, 2011) but may also
play a role in the unlimited growth of, in particular, ERα-
dependent breast tumours of which around 70% respond to
anti-oestrogen therapy with, for example, the antagonist ta-
moxifen (Ali and Coombes, 2000). ERβ has been shown to
counteract the ERα-mediated stimulation of cell proliferation
(Bardin et al., 2004; Stossi et al., 2004; Strom et al., 2004;
Sotoca et al., 2008b; Sotoca et al., 2008a; Thomas and
Gustafsson, 2011). These opposite roles of ERα and ERβ in
cellular responses to oestrogens have been illustrated by stud-
ies using the so-called T47D–ERβ cell line, a breast cancer cell
line with a constant level of ERα, and a tetracycline-
dependent adjustable expression level of ERβ (Strom et al.,
2004). When cells of this cell line express mainly ERα, genis-
tein and E2 both appeared to induce a concentration-
dependent increase in proliferation. When ERβ expression is
induced, E2 and genistein no longer induce cell proliferation.
These results support the conclusion that ERβ plays a role in
counteracting ERα-mediated cell proliferation.
Because ERα and ERβ have different roles in gene regula-
tion, cell proliferation and related health effects, their vary-
ing ratio and relative level within tissues may influence the
cellular response towards different phytoestrogens. As a re-
sult, a certain phytoestrogen may have different effects in,
for example, the uterus, in which ERα is the major isoform
(Pearce and Jordan, 2004), than in the prostate, in which
ERβ is dominant (Enmark et al., 1997; Pearce and Jordan,
2004). These tissue-specific effects may also result from
differences in coactivators and corepressors activated upon
activation of the two ERs in different tissues and/or the pos-
sible crosstalk of the ERs with other nuclear receptors
(Wilson et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2008; Vanden Berghe
and Haegeman, 2008; Evers et al., 2014a; Evers et al.,
2014b). Furthermore, the actual mode of action of a
phytoestrogen, either as an agonist or an antagonist, may
also depend on the level of endogenous estrogens present
(Barnes et al., 1995).
Using various in vitro models that have been developed for
the detection of oestrogen activity, the relative oestrogenic
potencies of a variety of phytoestrogens have been quanti-
fied. These in vitro assays include receptor binding studies
(Kuiper et al., 1998; Gutendorf and Westendorf, 2001; Ikeda
et al., 2002; De Angelis et al., 2005; Boue et al., 2011; Park
et al., 2012; Djiogue et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014), ERα and
ERβ-dependent reporter gene assays (Kuiper et al., 1998;
Casanova et al., 1999; Dornstauder et al., 2001; Gutendorf
and Westendorf, 2001; Ikeda et al., 2002; Rickard et al.,
2003; De Angelis et al., 2005; Harris et al., 2005; Escande
et al., 2006; ter Veld et al., 2006; Chrzan and Bradford, 2007;
Sotoca et al., 2008b; Chu et al., 2009; Kwack et al., 2009;
Takeuchi et al., 2009; Boue et al., 2011; Park et al., 2012;
Djiogue et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014; Tiosano et al., 2014; Islam
et al., 2015) and cell proliferation assays using oestrogen-
sensitive human cell lines derived from three different female
oestrogen-sensitive tissues, including breast (MCF-7/BOS and
T47D), endometrial (ECC-1) and ovarian (BG-1) cells (Wang
et al., 2012). Few studies also report on the oestrogenic effects
of phytoestrogens in vivo in the so-called uterotrophic assay
(Ding et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2012).
For the present review, we performed a literature research
on the binding affinity of E2 and phytoestrogens to ERα and
ERβ (expressed as IC50 values from competitive binding
assays) and the ERα- and ERβ-mediated gene expression in-
duced by E2 and phytoestrogens (expressed as EC50 values
from reporter gene assays). To obtain this overview, we
searched Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed for entries with
the search terms ‘phytoestrogen(s)’, ‘ERα’, ‘ERβ’, ‘binding af-
finity’ and/or ‘reporter gene’ in titles, abstracts and keywords.
In Figure 3, the reported IC50 and EC50 values for ERα are
plotted against the reported IC50 and EC50 values for ERβ. In

 Tables S1 and S2, the IC50 values and the EC50 values, respec-
tively, and the references to the literature are presented.
The overall trend emerging from this overview is that
phytoestrogens are less potent oestrogens than E2 with
higher IC50 and EC50 values for both receptors (Figure 3). Fur-
thermore, the data show for most phytoestrogens that have
been investigated, that the IC50 values are higher for ERα than
for ERβ (Figure 3A), indicating a higher binding preference for
the ERβ than for the ERα. Only for ferutinine, kievitone and
for psoralidin the IC50 values are higher for ERβ than for ERα
(Table S1), indicating a higher binding preference for the
ERα
for
these
phytoestrogens.
A
higher
preference
of
ferutinine for ERα was also found in reporter gene studies,
whereas for the majority of phytoestrogens tested in reporter
gene systems, a preference for ERβ-mediated gene expression
was observed (Figure 3B and Table S2). Most research on the
binding of phytoestrogens to ERα and ERβ, and the activation
of ERα- and ERβ-mediated gene expression has been con-
ducted with the major soy isoflavones genistein and daidzein
(Kuiper et al., 1998; Casanova et al., 1999; Dornstauder et al.,
2001; Gutendorf and Westendorf, 2001; Rickard et al., 2003;
Bovee et al., 2004; De Angelis et al., 2005; Harris et al.,
2005; Escande et al., 2006; Chrzan and Bradford, 2007;
Sotoca et al., 2008b; Chu et al., 2009; Takeuchi et al.,
2009; Tiosano et al., 2014; Beekmann et al., 2015; Islam
et al., 2015). Figure 4 presents an example of such a study
with genistein as measured in the human osteosarcoma
(U2OS) ERα or ERβ reporter cell lines, comparing the activ-
ity of genistein with that of E2 (Sotoca et al., 2008b). The
data presented in Figure 4 reveal that for E2, physiological
concentrations may be such that only ERα is activated since
the EC50 value of E2 for activation of ERα is about 10-fold
lower than that for activation of ERβ. For the isoflavone
genistein, the EC50 for ERβ activation is lower than that
for ERα activation, indicating that concentrations that
activate ERα will at the same time activate ERβ that will
counteract the ERα-mediated effects on cell proliferation
(Strom et al., 2004; Sotoca et al., 2008a; Rietjens et al.,
2013). This may result in different physiological effects
induced by E2 than those induced by phytoestrogens.

 It is also of interest to note the possible role of G protein-
coupled oestrogen receptors (GPERs), since many of the
phytoestrogens including the soy isoflavone genistein and
possibly equol activate GPERs (Prossnitz and Barton, 2011).
In cell lines of thyroid, ovarian, endometrial and breast
cancers, stimulation of GPERs with oestrogens including
genistein, activates a signalling pathway that promotes
proliferation, although inhibition of proliferation has also
been reported. In particular, genistein has been reported to
stimulate growth of MCF-7 cells through a GPER-dependent
mechanism (Prossnitz and Barton, 2011).
Mode(s) of action: epigenetic effects
Another mode of action underlying the health effects of
phytoestrogens may relate to epigenetic mechanisms. Vari-
ous natural bioactive compounds have been shown to affect
the epigenome, but for phytoestrogens, this has been mainly
assessed for the soy isoflavone genistein, and to a lesser extent
for the soy isoflavone daidzein and its microbial metabolite
equol (Remely et al., 2015b). Especially for the reduction in
cancer risk by the isoflavone genistein, a role for epigenetic
changes resulting in alterations in the expression of genes
that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation has been
reported (Dolinoy et al., 2006; Hilakivi-Clarke et al., 2010).
Genistein consumption is also among the factors that have
been associated with epigenetic modifications in obesity
(Remely et al., 2015a). Among these epigenetic changes were
effects on DNA methylation, histone modification and
microRNA regulation (Rietjens et al., 2013). Several studies
have assessed the effects of genistein on DNA methylation.
Dolinoy et al. (2006) investigated, in the so-called agouti
mouse model, the effect of genistein on DNA methylation
in the offspring exposed during gestation. Genistein induced
CpG hypermethylation of six CpG sites upstream of the
agouti gene, resulting in a shift of the coat colour distribution
towards pseudoagouti (brown), and a decrease in the inci-
dence of the onset of obesity in the offspring at adult age
(Dolinoy et al., 2006). The authors speculated that this ability
of genistein to increase DNA methylation might provide an
explanation for the lower incidence of certain cancers in
Asians as compared with Westerners (Qin et al., 2009). This
observation could provide another explanation for the
different
outcomes
reported
when
studying
effects
of
phytoestrogens on breast cancer incidence. It could be that
beneficial effects result from epigenetic modifications that
occur early in life perhaps even through soy intake by the
mother, but that these beneficial effects may not be observed
when intake of soy isoflavones starts later in life, for example
when using hormone replacement therapy. Also, adolescence
may reflect a sensitive period for phytoestrogens, and phyto-
estrogen intake during adolescence may reduce breast cancer
risk later in life (Lee et al., 2009; Anderson et al., 2013;
Molzberger et al., 2013).
In in vitro studies, genistein has been shown to decrease
the methylation of several tumour suppressor genes (Pudenz
et al., 2014), which may be mediated by the inhibition of
DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) activity (Singh et al.,
2013). This may allow silenced tumour suppressor genes to
be re-expressed, indicating a potential beneficial effect of
genistein. However, inhibition of DNMT may also lead to a
reduced methylation of proto-oncogenes, as has been shown
for coumestrol, daidzein and equol (Lyn-Cook et al., 1995;
Koo et al., 2015), which may indicate a possible adverse effect.
However, whether these findings from in vitro studies are
relevant for the in vivo situation remains to be established,
since genistein has been shown to cause an increase in DNA
methylation upon exposure in vivo, such as in the agouti
mouse model as mentioned above (Dolinoy et al., 2006) and
in humans (Qin et al., 2009). This human study was a
double-blind, randomized trial with 34 healthy premeno-
pausal women, who received 40 or 140 mg isoflavones
(including genistein, daidzein and glycitein) a day for the
duration of one menstrual cycle, followed by characterization
of the methylation status of five cancer related genes known
to be methylated in breast cancer (p16, RASSF1A, RARβ2, ER
and CCND2) assessed in isolated breast tissue samples (Qin
et al., 2009). The results obtained revealed a treatment-related
hypermethylation of the tumour suppressor genes RARβ2 and
CCND2. The implications of these findings for human health
are not clear yet, although this increase in methylation of
tumour suppressor genes may indicate a possible adverse
epigenetic change.
Other possible modes of action
In addition to the action of phytoestrogens via the oestrogen
receptors or epigenetic modes of action, some studies
suggested other possible modes of action of phytoestrogens.
This includes, for example, the effects of genistein resulting
in activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (EC number
2.7.11.31) in cells exposed to genistein in vitro (Hwang et al.,
2005; Park et al., 2010). The exact mechanism underlying this
activation has not been fully elucidated (Hsu et al., 2011) but
may be related to genistein-mediated stimulation of intracel-
lular production of ROS (Hwang et al., 2005).
Another mode of action may relate to the action of
phytoestrogens as kinase inhibitors (Dubey et al., 1999; Kang
et al., 2007; Yan et al., 2010). Given that the human kinome is
composed of hundreds of protein kinases of which many
have been reported to be disease associated (Manning et al.,
2002; Lahiry et al., 2010), one could suggest that this is a pos-
sible mode of action underlying the effects of phytoestrogens
on health. It is important to note, however, that EC50 values
generally reported for this inhibition of protein kinases by
isoflavones seem to be around the two-digit and lower
three-digit μM range (Dubey et al., 1999; Kang et al., 2007;
Kim et al., 2009), which is substantially higher than generally
reported physiological plasma concentrations of the respec-
tive phytoestrogens, which tend to be in the two- to three-
digit nM range, rarely reaching low μM concentrations (King
and Bursill, 1998; Verkasalo et al., 2001; Setchell et al., 2003).
Phytoestrogens may also activate the PPAR (NRC1C) fam-
ily including, particularly PPARα (NR1C1), and PPARγ (perox-
isome proliferator activated receptor γ) (NR1C3) (Jungbauer
and Medjakovic, 2014). It has been suggested that this mode
of action mainly contributes to the possible effects of
phytoestrogens on obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2
diabetes, as PPARγ agonists are effective drugs for patients
with type 2 diabetes. Specifically, isoflavones and their me-
tabolites appear to be PPAR agonists with EC50 values in the
two-digit μM range (Jungbauer and Medjakovic, 2014). It re-
mains

whether

 concentrations are actually high enough to induce these
PPAR-mediated effects.
Another mode of action, suggested mainly for the benefi-
cial health effects of phytoestrogens, is the induction
of
antioxidant/electrophile
response
element
(ARE/
EpRE)-mediated gene expression by activation of nuclear fac-
tor erythroid 2-related factor 2-Keap 1 signalling (Jungbauer
and Medjakovic, 2014). EpRE-mediated induction of gene
expression leads to increased cellular defence against the
toxicity of electrophiles and ROS and related adverse health
effects. Activation of this pathway may be related to
protection against tumour induction and oxidative stress in
cardiovascular disease.
Finally, it is of interest to consider the possible role
of
polymorphisms
in
the
differential
effects
of
phytoestrogens. So far, differences in health effects of
phytoestrogens have not been related to specific gene
polymorphisms. However, since ERs seem to play an impor-
tant role in several of the health effects of phytoestrogens, it
can be expected that phytoestrogen-related health effects
may differ between persons with differences in ER function,
for example resulting from ER gene polymorphisms. Nott
et al. (2008) concluded that an increasing body of evidence
implicates ERα polymorphisms as one of the contributing
factors for differential responses to oestrogen competitors
and that polymorphisms in the ER genes may influence the
individual
response
to
hormone
replacement
therapy
(Gennari et al., 2005). Polymorphisms of genes that play a
role in the metabolism of (phyto)oestrogens may also play a
role in differences in health effects of phytoestrogens in the
human population (Wang et al., 2011). Also, polymorphisms
related to interindividual differences in the gut microbiota
and the consequences of these differences for formation of
(in)active metabolites may play a role. An adequate example
is the formation of equol as a metabolite of daidzein only in
a part of the population. Equol has been reported to be more
active as an oestrogen-active compound than daidzein itself
(Magee,
2011).
Another
example
is
the
formation
of
enterodiol and enterolactone from ingested lignans through
the gut microbiota in only a part of the population (Kuijsten
et al., 2005; Hullar et al., 2015). Also, these differences can be
an underlying reason for different responses to phyto-
estrogen exposure in the population.
Effects of phytoestrogens on menopausal
symptoms
Several
meta-analyses
investigated
the
effects
of
phytoestrogens or soy isoflavone extracts or supplements on
menopausal symptoms. These studies reported not only a
reduction in the frequency and severity of hot flashes (Howes
et al., 2006; Taku et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2015) but also no
conclusive evidence or only some indications for a reduction
in hot flush frequency or severity (Nedrow et al., 2006;
Lethaby et al., 2007; Jacobs et al., 2009; Bolanos et al., 2010;
Eden, 2012; Lethaby et al., 2013), varying effects on spine
bone mineral density and no effects on femoral neck, hip to-
tal and trochanter bone mineral density (Taku et al., 2010),
and no protection against bone fracture (Kreijkamp-Kaspers
et al., 2004; Tempfer et al., 2007). The European Food Safety
Authority (EFSA) evaluated the health claims related to the
reduction of vasomotor symptoms and the maintenance of
bone mineral density by soy isoflavones during menopause
(EFSA NDA Panel, 2012). It was concluded that the available
evidence was not sufficient to establish a relationship
between the maintenance of bone mineral density and the
consumption of soy isoflavones. Also, a relationship be-
tween the reduction of vasomotor symptoms associated
with menopause and the consumption of soy isoflavones
could not be established. EFSA evaluated 14 long-term
(>12 months) intervention studies on the effects of soy
isoflavones on bone mineral density in post-menopausal
women. Of these studies, only two, reported an effect of
soy isoflavones on bone mineral density and on markers
of bone formation or resorption at doses of 54 mg per day
(Morabito et al., 2002; Marini et al., 2007). The remaining
12 studies, testing doses of isoflavones up to 200 mg per
day, showed no effects of soy isoflavones on bone mineral
density or markers of bone formation or resorption [(EFSA
NDA Panel, 2012) and references therein], although EFSA
indicated that for some studies this negative result may
have been due to the limited number of subjects included,
resulting in an underpowered study.
EFSA also evaluated five human intervention studies in
which soy isoflavones were administered for 6–9 months,
and effects on bone mineral density were measured in peri-/
post-menopausal women. One of these intervention studies
revealed a beneficial dose–response effect on bone mineral
density at the lumbar spine and femoral neck. Two of the
studies reported a beneficial effect of soy isoflavones on bone
mineral density at the lumbar spine, and two studies showed
no effect of soy isoflavones on bone mineral density. EFSA
concluded that ‘these studies provide some evidence for an
effect of soy isoflavones on the attenuation of bone mineral
density loss at the lumbar spine in post-menopausal women
when consumed for 6-9 months’. Given the effects reported
on parameters for bone formation and bone resorption, EFSA
also concluded that these effects were possibly mediated by a
decrease in bone resorption. However, taking all the evidence
together, EFSA considered ‘the evidence insufficient to estab-
lish a cause and effect relationship between the consumption
of soy isoflavones and maintenance of bone mineral density
in post-menopausal women’.
A later study reported by Greendale et al. (Greendale et al.,
2015) investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal relations
between dietary intake of isoflavones and bone mineral
density at the lumbar spine and femoral neck in Black, White,
Chinese and Japanese women during the menopausal transi-
tion. In Japanese women, higher isoflavone intake appeared
to be associated not only with higher peak femoral neck bone
mineral density but also with greater rates of lumbar spine
and femoral neck bone mineral density loss during the
menopausal transition. Results for the other racial/ethnic
groups did not support a relationship between dietary intake
of isoflavones and either peak bone mineral density, or bone
mineral density loss during the menopausal transition.
Altogether, it seems that the evidence for a beneficial
effect of isoflavones and other phytoestrogens on bone
mineral density in post- and peri-menopausal women is
limited and not convincing, and that they may even cause
adverse effects, as indicated by the study of Greendale et al.
(2015).

 Effects of phytoestrogens on cardiovascular
disease
In particular, the increase in cardiovascular risk and cardio-
vascular mortality upon sudden loss of ovarian function has
provided a basis for the proposed role of oestrogens and
phytoestrogens in the reduction in cardiovascular disease
(Colditz et al., 1987; Parker et al., 2009). Reduced oestrogen
levels during menopause may influence the development of
obesity, fat distribution, the lipid profile in plasma, and rheo-
logical properties of plasma and platelet function (Gorodeski,
1994). These observations suggest that oestrogen deficiency
may promote cardiovascular disease in women and trigger
the idea that phytoestrogens may reduce the risk. The hy-
pothesis is also supported by the low rates of cardiovascular
diseases in Asian populations where the diet is particularly
rich in soy, followed by the loss of this protection among
the groups that have moved to Western societies (Nagata,
2000; Zhang et al., 2003). A meta-analysis reported by Tokede
et al. (2015) concluded that isoflavone supplementation had
no effect on serum lipid profiles.
Oestrogens have been shown to influence atherosclerosis
and the related clinical events in a differential way (Rossouw
et al., 2007; Cano et al., 2010). They may act not only as pro-
tectors against atherosclerosis but also as potential disruptors
of established atherosclerotic plaques, the latter being impor-
tant hallmarks in the pathogenesis of the arterial forms of
cardiovascular disease. The concept that phytoestrogens
may act in a similar way comes from the observation that in
Asian populations with high levels of their consumption,
the prevalence of cardiovascular disease is lower than in
populations in Western countries (Gonzalez Canete and
Duran Aguero, 2014).
Cano et al. (2010) and also Gonzalez Canete and Duran
Aguero (2014) reviewed the main evidence on the effects of
isoflavones on the cardiovascular system at both the experi-
mental and the clinical level. The review indicated that two
clinical studies (van der Schouw et al., 2005; Kokubo et al.,
2007) have examined the association of isoflavone intake
with clinical cardiovascular events in a population without
cardiovascular disease at baseline. One study concluded that
high isoflavone intake was associated with reduced risk of ce-
rebral and myocardial infarctions in Japanese women, with
the risk reduction being especially pronounced in postmeno-
pausal women (Kokubo et al., 2007). The second study was
performed in a Western population and investigated whether
a low intake of phytoestrogens would be associated with in-
creased risks of cardiovascular disease (van der Schouw et al.,
2005). The study concluded that an intake of isoflavones or
lignans was not associated with decreased cardiovascular
disease risk. However, when stratifying for ever versus never
smokers, the risk of cardiovascular disease appeared to
decrease with increased intake of lignans for ever smokers.
The authors concluded that their data do not support the
presence of a protective effect on cardiovascular disease risk
of higher habitual intake of phytoestrogens, although for
smokers a small risk reduction with higher lignan intake
could not be excluded. In clinical practice, none of the
phytoestrogens investigated have been proven to protect
against cardiovascular disease (Tempfer et al., 2007).
Altogether, it can be concluded that it is not really clear if
the
administration
of
phytoestrogens
in
the
early
postmenopausal period may be protective for cardiovascular
disease. For phytoestrogens, the current evidence appears
poor compared to that available for oestrogens, and it is pos-
sible that the potential effect of oestrogens on the risk for
stroke is not reproduced by isoflavones (Cano et al., 2010).
Effects of phytoestrogens on obesity, metabolic
syndrome and type 2 diabetes
Dietary phytoestrogens have also been suggested to play a
beneficial role in obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 dia-
betes (Bhathena and Velasquez, 2002; Cederroth and Nef,
2009; Crespillo et al., 2011; Jungbauer and Medjakovic,
2014; Struja et al., 2014). The meta-analysis by Fang et al.
(2016) reported an improvement in glucose metabolism and
a significant reduction in insulin levels and insulin resistance
in menopausal women, by especially genistein. Also, the
meta-analysis reported by Zhang et al. (2013) concluded that
soy isoflavone supplementation could improve glucose me-
tabolism and insulin control in non-Asian postmenopausal
women. Nutritional intervention studies in both animals
and humans suggested that an intake of soy protein with
isoflavones and flaxseed results in improved glucose control
and insulin resistance (Bhathena and Velasquez, 2002;
Cederroth and Nef, 2009; Jungbauer and Medjakovic, 2014).
It is important to note that at present, it often remains
unclear whether the beneficial effects are really due to
the phytoestrogens or to some other dietary component
in the soy protein and flax seed diet. The activation of
PPAR-mediated effects already mentioned above may provide
a possible mode of action underlying these effects. However,
as already concluded by Bhathena and Velasquez (2002),
further investigations are needed to evaluate the long-term
effects of phytoestrogens on obesity, metabolic syndrome
and type 2 diabetes.
Effects of phytoestrogens on breast cancer
The use of soy-based preparations has been proposed for the
prevention and treatment of certain types of cancer, such as
for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer in women
and prostate cancer in men (Eisenbrand et al., 2007). In
contrast, clinical studies have reported data that suggest that
isoflavones may via their oestrogenic and proliferative effects
possibly raise breast cancer incidence in sensitive individuals
(Petrakis et al., 1996; Hargreaves et al., 1999).
Meta-analyses of epidemiological studies conducted in
women consuming high-soy diets concluded that there is a
significant trend of decreased risk for breast cancer upon
increasing intake of soy food (Trock et al., 2006; Wu et al.,
2008; Dong and Qin, 2011; Chen et al., 2014). High lignan ex-
posure has also been associated with a reduced breast cancer
risk in postmenopausal women (Velentzis et al., 2009; Buck
et al., 2010). Fritz et al. (2013) reported a systematic review
and meta-analysis on the potential effects of soy, red clover
and isoflavone intake on breast cancer incidence and recur-
rence. The analysis included 40 randomized controlled trials,
11 uncontrolled trials and 80 observational studies. The
authors concluded that soy consumption may be associated
with reduced risk of breast cancer incidence, recurrence and
mortality. Soy intake consistent with a traditional Japanese
diet (2–3 servings a day containing 25–50 mg isoflavones)

 may also be protective against breast cancer and recurrence.
Nevertheless, the authors also indicate that better evidence
confirming the safety of isoflavones would be required before
the use of high doses (≥100 mg) of isoflavones can be recom-
mended for breast cancer patients. In addition, a nested
case–control study and meta-analysis of epidemiological
studies revealed an inverse correlation between genistein
intake and breast cancer (Taylor et al., 2009). It is important
to note that this protective effect may originate from soy
intake early in life (Warri et al., 2008; Hilakivi-Clarke et al.,
2010). Also of interest is the possible involvement of equol,
a metabolite of daidzein produced by the human intestinal
microflora, which may have similar beneficial effects on the
incidence of breast cancer (Ingram et al., 1997; Goodman
et al., 2009), although other studies have reported no or even
adverse effects of equol (Magee, 2011). Given that only a
limited percentage (30–40%) of the population has the ability
to convert daidzein to equol, and taking into account that
in vitro studies suggest equol to be more biologically active
than its parent compound daidzein (Magee, 2011), it can be
suggested that inter-individual variation in response to daid-
zein may in part be related to variability in gut microflora
composition resulting in inter-individual differences in
conversion of daidzein to equol. This existence of equol
producers and non-producers could provide an alternative
explanation for interindividual differences in the response
to phytoestrogens, since phytoestrogen metabolite forma-
tion by the gut microbiota can vary significantly between
individuals with metabolites sometimes being more active
than the parent phytoestrogen.
Also, the lignans enterodiol and enterolactone have been
suggested to exert protective effects on breast cancer, possibly
not only by oestrogen receptor-dependent but also oestrogen
receptor-independent mechanisms (Mueller et al., 2004;
Adlercreutz, 2007; Penttinen et al., 2007; Mense et al., 2008;
Saarinen et al., 2010; Buck et al., 2011). There are also signifi-
cant
inter-individual
differences
for
enterodiol
and
enterolactone production due to different compositions of
the gut microflora, which can cause a variation in the re-
sponse of individuals to lignan precursors (Yoder et al.,
2015).
While
coumestans
are
reported
to
be
potent
phytoestrogens in vitro, their effect on breast cancer is not
known (Scarlata and Miksicek, 1995; Kuiper et al., 1998).
Recently, EFSA published a risk assessment for peri- and
post-menopausal women consuming food supplements con-
taining isolated isoflavones (EFSA ANS Panel, 2015). EFSA
evaluated especially the possible association between the iso-
flavone intake from food supplements and harmful effects
observed in peri- and post-menopausal women for the mam-
mary gland, uterus and thyroid (EFSA ANS Panel, 2015). For
the evaluation, EFSA selected 43 human studies and 62 ani-
mal studies. Among these studies were four epidemiological
studies investigating breast cancer incidence (Rebbeck et al.,
2007; Obi et al., 2009; Brasky et al., 2010; Boucher et al.,
2013), eight interventional controlled studies, measuring
mammographic density (Morabito et al., 2002; Atkinson
et al., 2004; Marini et al., 2008; Powles et al., 2008; Verheus
et al., 2008; Maskarinec et al., 2009; Colacurci et al., 2013;
Delmanto et al., 2013), and two interventional controlled
studies,
investigating
histopathological
changes
(Cheng
et al., 2007; Khan et al., 2012). These studies did not reveal
an association between isoflavone exposure and adverse
effects in the mammary gland (EFSA ANS Panel, 2015). Of
the 11 animal studies that investigated histopathological
changes in the mammary gland upon treatment with
isoflavones and the 10 studies in ovariectomized animals
that investigated breast cell proliferation, the majority did
not reveal an effect (EFSA ANS Panel, 2015). Only in two of
the studies in ovariectomized rats, a stimulating effect on
the mammary gland was observed after 90 days of dosing
with genistein at 5.4 and 54 (Rimoldi et al., 2007) and
221 mg.kg bwt�1.day�1 (Wuttke et al., 2006). EFSA concluded
that these findings were ‘consistent with the results from the
US National Toxicology Program study conducted in non-
ovariectomized animals administered genistein at doses
ranging 0.3–44 mg.kg bwt�1.day�1 (NTP, 2008), in which
there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of genistein
in female rats based on an increased incidence of mammary
gland adenoma or adenocarcinoma’. EFSA also indicated that
the human data from observational studies did not point at
an increased risk of breast cancer in menopausal women but
specifically also noted that this conclusion cannot be
extended to the risk of oestrogenic isoflavones-based food
supplements
for
postmenopausal
women
who
have
a
diagnosis or history of oestrogen-dependent cancer. Also,
other
endpoints
considered
did
not
reveal
any
effect
except for some non-malignant histopathological changes
in mammary tissue after 60 months supplementation at
150 mg·day�1 of soy isoflavones which is high compared
with the current estimated daily intakes.
Thus, concerns still exist that the oestrogenic activity of
phytoestrogens
may
present
a
risk
to
patients
with
oestrogen-sensitive breast cancer and to women that are at a
high risk of developing breast tumours (Messina, 2008;
Hilakivi-Clarke et al., 2010), and it remains to be stablished
whether exposure to isoflavones reduces or increases breast
cancer risks.
Effects of phytoestrogens on other forms of
cancer including prostate cancer
, bowel cancer
,
uterine cancer and other cancers
Epidemiological studies and a nested case–control study
carried out in Japan reported that isoflavone intake might
be associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer (Shimazu
et al., 2011). This observation also follows from a meta-
analysis indicating that the consumption of soy food is asso-
ciated with lower lung cancer risk (Yang et al., 2011). Another
nested
case–control
study
performed
with
the
Korean
Multicenter cancer cohort revealed that high serum concen-
trations of isoflavones were associated with a decreased risk
for gastric cancer (Ko et al., 2010). Furthermore, several
studies report a negative correlation between prostate cancer
incidence and a phytoestrogen rich diet containing lignans
and/or isoflavones (Severson et al., 1989; Adlercreutz, 1995;
Kurahashi et al., 2007), and a meta-analysis revealed that
the consumption of soy foods or genistein and daidzein is
associated with a reduction in prostate cancer risk in men
(Hwang et al., 2009; Yan and Spitznagel, 2009; He et al.,
2015). Another meta-analysis reported by Van Die et al.
(2014) concluded that there is a potential role for soy and
soy isoflavones in reducing risks for prostate cancer, but that

 a clear understanding could not be derived from the data be-
cause of limitations in sample size and study duration in the
individual trials. Also equol, the gut microbiome metabolite
of the soy isoflavone daidzein was suggested to have benefi-
cial effects on the incidence of prostate cancer (Akaza et al.,
2004; Ozasa et al., 2004). Epidemiological studies suggest that
high dietary intake of phytoestrogens in pre- and post-
menopausal women is correlated with reduced thyroid
cancer risk (Horn-Ross et al., 2002; Haselkorn et al., 2003).
For oestrogens in general, increased exposure has been linked
to an increased risk of developing uterus cancer in women
(Persson, 2000), and of prostate and testicular cancer in
men (Bonkhoff et al., 1999; Maffini et al., 2006). Women
who consume a diet rich in isoflavones or soy may have a
lower risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer (Eden, 2012;
Qu et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015).
The
risk
assessment
for
peri-
and
post-menopausal
women
taking
isoflavone-containing
food
supplements
performed by EFSA (EFSA ANS Panel, 2015) also evaluated
the possible association between the intake of isoflavones
from food supplements and harmful effects on the uterus.
EFSA reported that there was no study on the association be-
tween isoflavone intake and risk of uterine cancer in the tar-
get population. As surrogate markers, data on endometrial
thickness reported in 25 interventional controlled studies
and on histopathology of the endometrium presented in
nine interventional controlled studies were evaluated (EFSA
ANS
Panel,
2015).
No
significant
adverse
effects
were
observed in any of the human intervention studies, at dose
levels up to 150 mg isoflavone·day�1 for 2.5 years. Thirteen
studies in animals investigated cell proliferation in the
uterus, and 22 animal studies studied uterus histopathologi-
cal changes. No adverse effects were seen in any of the stud-
ies. EFSA concluded that the human and animal studies
support that in post-menopausal women adverse effects on
the uterus were not noted for soy isoflavones, but that in
the absence of data on the effect on uterine cancer, it was
not possible to draw conclusions on effects of isoflavones on
the uterus in peri-menopausal women (Horn-Ross et al.,
2002; Haselkorn et al., 2003).
Effects of phytoestrogens on the thyroid and
thyroid function
The soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein are reported to
inhibit
thyroid
peroxidase
(TPO)
in
vitro
(EC
number
1.11.1.8), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of T3 and T4
(Divi et al., 1997). Also in rats in vivo, daidzein and genistein
inhibit TPO activity; however, no other adverse effects on
thyroid functions could be observed (Chang and Doerge,
2000; Doerge and Sheehan, 2002). In addition, oestrogens
are implied to have indirect effects on thyroid function,
which has led to the concern that phytoestrogens may ad-
versely affect thyroid function. However, human studies on
the effect of soy isoflavones on thyroid function reviewed
by EFSA (EFSA ANS Panel, 2015) are not conclusive. Some
studies suggest that risk factors, such as iodine deficiency
and subclinical hypothyroidism, might increase susceptibil-
ity
of
individuals
to
potential
adverse
effects
of
soy
isoflavones on thyroid function (Doerge and Sheehan, 2002;
Sathyapalan et al., 2011).
Effects of phytoestrogens on brain function
Most studies on the effect of phytoestrogens on neurological
endpoints are conducted with soy isoflavones, while few
studies also addressed the effects of dietary lignans. The ratio-
nale behind such studies is that oestrogens play an important
role in brain health. The brain controls oestrogen release
through the hypothalamus–pituitary–gonadal axis and also
responds to oestrogens. In addition, oestradiol plays a key
role in the neurobiology of ageing, because endocrine and
neural senescence overlap in time and are mechanistically
intertwined in complex feedback loops (Morrison et al.,
2006). For oestrogen therapy, there are conflicting results on
whether protective or detrimental effects on brain health
are exerted. The reasons for the different observations appear
to lie in the time at which oestrogen therapy is initiated, the
neurological status of the brain at the time of oestrogen ther-
apy initiation and the type of therapy used (Brinton, 2004).
Interestingly, the loss of especially ERα seems to be associated
with reduced neuroprotection by E2, and there appears to be
a beneficial role for ERα in the aging brain (Schreihofer and
Ma, 2013). A literature review on the neuroprotective effects
of phytoestrogens found in soy reports that, while it has been
demonstrated in animal research and cell culture studies that
phytoestrogens from soy can exert neuroprotective effects,
clinical trials and observational studies in humans have pro-
duced inconclusive findings (Soni et al., 2014). In this review,
seven observational studies were reviewed; of which, three
found positive effects of isoflavones on cognition (Hogervorst
et al., 2008; Hogervorst et al., 2011; Greendale et al., 2012).
Out of the 12 randomized control trials reviewed, six reported
beneficial effects of isoflavone treatment on cognitive func-
tion (File et al., 2001; Duffy et al., 2003; Kritz-Silverstein
et al., 2003; Casini et al., 2006; Gleason et al., 2009; Thorp
et al., 2009). Despite positive findings of studies investigating
phytoestrogens and cognition, approximately half of the
reviewed studies demonstrate negative or null effects (Soni
et al., 2014). Just like for oestrogen therapy, also for
phytoestrogens, there are many factors that have an effect
on the outcomes, like age, gender, ethnicity, and menopausal
status, as well as duration of consumption, and the cognitive
test used. One important characteristic of the study popula-
tion is the metabolic capacity to produce equol, which differs
between Asian and non-Asian study populations, and gener-
ally declines with age (Soni et al., 2014).
Consumption of soy or soy isoflavones has been shown to
affect various endpoints related to neuronal health in rats
(Zeng et al., 2004; Azcoitia et al., 2006; Huang and Zhang,
2010; Neese et al., 2010; Pan et al., 2010; Bagheri et al.,
2012), and in mice (Zhao and Brinton, 2009; Bansal and
Parle, 2010; Zhao et al., 2011; Yao et al., 2013), while
consumption of large doses are also reported to have negative
effects on the brain of rats (Choi and Lee, 2004). It is of inter-
est to note that the protective effects of genistein on the cere-
bral cortex of ageing rats were suggested to have a different
mode of action than that of oestradiol (Moran et al., 2013).
Different lignans have shown positive effects on cognitive
performance and markers of Alzheimer’s disease in mice (Um
et al., 2009; Giridharan et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2012; Jeong et al.,
2013; Li et al., 2014; Mao et al., 2015). In observational studies
in humans, higher dietary intake of lignans is associated with
better cognitive function (Franco et al., 2005; Kreijkamp-

 Kaspers et al., 2007; Greendale et al., 2012; Nooyens et al.,
2015), while coumestrol ingestion was unrelated to cognitive
performance (Greendale et al., 2012).
Altogether, the data presented on possible beneficial
effects
of
phytoestrogens
on
neurological
health
are
inconclusive and seem to be affected by various factors.
Furthermore, it is not clear, whether the observed beneficial
effects are due to an oestrogen-like mode of action, or
whether other mechanisms underlie these effects.
Discussion
Many health effects including both benefits and risks have
been related to exposure to phytoestrogens. Reported bene-
fits include a lowered risk of menopausal symptoms, cardio-
vascular
disease,
breast
cancer,
other
forms
of
cancer
including prostate cancer, bowel cancer, uterine cancer and
other cancers, and brain function disorders. On the other
hand,
phytoestrogens
are
also
considered
endocrine
disruptors, indicating that they have the potential to cause
adverse health effects such as infertility and increased risks
of cancer in oestrogen-sensitive organs. These adverse effects
have been mainly suggested based on data from in vitro, ani-
mal or epidemiological studies. Clinical studies often report
the absence of adverse effects. Tempfer et al. (2009) reported
a meta-analysis on possible side effects of phytoestrogens.
Based on 174 randomized controlled trials, it was concluded
that phytoestrogen supplements have a safe side effect profile
with moderately elevated rates of gastrointestinal side effects.
It is important to note, however, that these studies were gen-
erally not designed to study the safety of the phytoestrogens.
Consequently, the question of whether phytoestrogens
are beneficial or harmful to human health remains of
importance. The present overview reveals that the answer is
rather complex and may depend on age, health status, and
even the presence or absence of specific gut microflora in
the population of concern. To further illustrate this complex-
ity, Figure 5 presents a cartoon summarizing the possible
health effects of phytoestrogens and the potential underlying
modes of action as presented in the present paper.
Given the rapid increase in global consumption of
phytoestrogens and the fact that phytoestrogens are present
in a wide range of dietary food supplements and widely
marketed as a natural alternative to oestrogen replacement
therapy, further insight into the risks and benefits of these
phytoestrogens seems essential. Additional issues to be taken
into account in the near future include (i) effects on children
since phytoestrogens may be present in for example soy
based infant foods; (ii) the role of the gut microbiota in
phytoestrogen metabolism and differences in this microbial
metabolism and the consequences for the health effects; (iii)
the role of possible other modes of action than the
oestrogenic activity in the health effects of phytoestrogens;
(iv) the physiological levels of the phytoestrogens and their
metabolites and how these relate to concentrations required
in in vitro cellular models to actually induce the different
effects; (v) the role of polymorphisms in the differential
biological effects of phytoestrogens and the possible contri-
bution of -omics technologies to elucidate these effects; and
(vi) the fact that most phytoestrogens are weak oestrogens
with anti-oestrogenic effects when they compete with endog-
enous oestrogens for binding to the ERs, but pro-oestrogenic
effects
in
the
absence
of
endogenous
oestrogens
and
uncertain effects in the presence of low concentrations of
endogenous oestrogens as occurs in the menopause.
The current review presents an overview of the potential
health benefits of dietary phytoestrogens. It is of interest to

 put the observations within the guidance developed by EFSA
for performing risk–benefit assessments of food. Given that in
Europe food supplements are considered food this seems
appropriate. EFSA recommended a stepwise approach for
the risk–benefit assessment including first an assessment of
whether the health risks clearly outweigh the health benefits
or vice versa. The literature overview presented in this paper
illustrates that at the current state-of-the-art the beneficial
health effects are not so obvious that they clearly outweigh
the possible health risks. This implies that a further refine-
ment of the assessment would be required, aiming at
providing semi-quantitative or quantitative estimates of risks
and benefits at relevant exposures by using common metrics,
and a comparison of risks and benefits using a composite
metric such as disability-adjusted life years or quality-
adjusted life years to express the outcome of the risk–benefit
assessment as a single net health impact value. The currently
available data set is not sufficient to support such a refined
(semi) quantitative analysis. Taking all together, it can be
concluded
that
several
potential
health
benefits
of
phytoestrogens have been reported but that, given the data
on potential adverse health effects, the current evidence on
these beneficial health effects is not so obvious that they
clearly outweigh the possible health risks. This implies that
a definite conclusion on possible beneficial health effects of
phytoestrogens cannot be made.
