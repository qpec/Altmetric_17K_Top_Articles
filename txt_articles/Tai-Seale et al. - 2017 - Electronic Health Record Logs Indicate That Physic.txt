Abstract
Time spent by physicians is a key resource in health care delivery. This study used data captured 
by the access time stamp functionality of an electronic health record (EHR) to examine physician 
work effort. This is a potentially powerful, yet unobtrusive, way to study physicians’ use of time. 
We used data on physicians’ time allocation patterns captured by over thirty-one million EHR 
transactions in the period 2011–14 recorded by 471 primary care physicians, who collectively 
worked on 765,129 patients’ EHRs. Our results suggest that the physicians logged an average of 
3.08 hours on office visits and 3.17 hours on desktop medicine each day. Desktop medicine 
consists of activities such as communicating with patients through a secure patient portal, 
responding to patients’ online requests for prescription refills or medical advice, ordering tests, 
sending staff messages, and reviewing test results. Over time, log records from physicians showed 
a decline in the time allocated to face-to-face visits, accompanied by an increase in time allocated

 to desktop medicine. Staffing and scheduling in the physician’s office, as well as provider payment 
models for primary care practice, should account for these desktop medicine efforts.
Physician time is a key resource in health services delivery. Understanding how physicians 
spend their clinical time is essential, given the need to understand practical capacity; guide 
staffing, scheduling, and support models in the physician’s office; and improve the accuracy 
of payment for physician services. Fee-for-service payments are intended to reflect resources 
(captured as relative value units, or RVUs) used before, during, and after clinical encounters 
associated with face-to-face ambulatory care visits.1–3 Questions have been raised about 
whether the reports underlying the RVU estimates are accurate and representative of true 
physician effort in providing patient care services. In the age of electronic health records 
(EHRs) with patient portals, patients often request services (such as prescription refills and 
medical advice) online, without face-to-face visits. Physician effort in addressing these 
online requests was absent from the original RVU calculations.1–3
In addition to physician reports of their own efforts,2,4,5 researchers have used time-and-
motion studies6 and video7 and audio recordings.8 While these methods capture significant 
physician effort,6,9–11 they are costly to use and often evaluate only a limited number of 
physicians. Even the resource-based relative values scale (RBRVS) was built, for some 
specialties, on survey responses to vignettes from about twenty physicians.1 This scale is 
still the chief tool used to determine the periodic updates to the Medicare Fee Schedule. 
Furthermore, concerns about the Hawthorne effect preclude ongoing, broad-based direct 
observation of physician work effort.12
The access logs embedded in EHRs offer an unobtrusive way to study physicians’ use of 
time. Previous research has used access logs to examine how physicians use EHRs,13–18 to 
develop local access policies,19 and to detect suspicious access.20 We report here on an 
innovative use of the access log to study primary care physician work effort.
Similar to a customs agent stamping an international traveler’s passport with the time and 
place of entry and exit, the EpicCare EHR maintains an access log that tracks many discrete, 
time-stamped actions associated with patient care. The log records the user, time of access, 
device from which the EHR was accessed, and section of the EHR section that was accessed 
(for example, a medication list or lab results). To see how these data might characterize 
individual primary care physicians’ time spent on ambulatory patient care activities, we 
developed a method to categorize their work effort as captured in the access log.
The Palo Alto Medical Foundation Institutional Review Board approved the research 
protocol.
Study Data And Methods
The study used EHR data for the period 2011–14 from 471 physicians in forty-eight primary 
care departments of four divisions of a community-based health care system. This system 
contracts with multiple public and private payers and uses fee-for-service payment of 
physicians according to work RVUs.2 Examples of tasks reflected in the EHR data include 
Tai-Seale et al.

 typing progress notes (that is, the part of the EHR where physicians document a patient’s 
clinical status), messaging with patients via the secure patient portal, reviewing test results, 
and making referrals. Examples of time spent without accessing the EHR include huddling 
with medical assistants before and after visits, attending meetings, holding hallway 
discussions, taking breaks, and reading. (We discuss below how time spent using the EHR 
can approximate time spent face-to-face with patients.)
When a physician was not using the EHR, we could not attribute the time to any specific 
patient or type of activity; thus, this time was not included in our estimates. We calculated 
the average daily sum of each physician’s “in and out of clinic time” that could be assigned 
to specific patients. There was a clear decline in the number of logins to the EHR after 2:00 
a.m., which suggested that we could use that hour as the natural end for a given day. 
Therefore, EHR activities between midnight and 2:00 a.m. were treated as activities that 
occurred late at night in the previous day.
STUDY SAMPLE
The 471 physicians in our sample documented clinical work in the HER records of 765,129 
patients, 637,769 of whom were seen at least once in the 2,842,109 face-to-face ambulatory 
care visits during the four-year study period. Our analyses were based on logs showing when 
these physicians accessed the EHR from computers or other devices inside or outside the 
clinic.
About 62 percent of the physicians started working in the delivery system after it 
implemented an EpicCare EHR at their site. Equal shares of physicians (36 percent) were in 
internal and family medicine, and 28 percent were pediatricians. Regarding time spent in the 
clinic in terms of the share of a full-time equivalent (FTE) position, 52.9 percent of the 
physicians worked at least 75 percent FTE, 32.1 percent of physicians worked more than 50 
percent and less than 75 percent FTE, and 15.1 percent of physicians worked 50 percent 
FTE or less. The average age of the physicians in 2014 was forty-eight, and 69 percent of 
them were women.
IDENTIFYING TIME BLOCKS
The underlying unit of our approach, the “time block,” was characterized by four 
dimensions: the exact time the activity began and ended, patient identification number, the 
physician accessing the record, and the point of access (which could be a desktop computer 
in the exam room or at the physician’s desk in the clinic, or a remote secure computer or 
other device). These data allowed us to create a time block for each workstation-patient-
physician combination. Whenever a physician switched patients or workstations, a new time 
block was created. The time between the end of one block and the start of the next was 
treated as a “gap” and was not assigned to any patient. There were 31,002,888 time blocks 
attributed to the 471 physicians in the four-year study period. For an illustration of the kinds 
of activities that a physician could be engaged in and how we categorized them based on the 
log data, see the online Appendix.21

 CATEGORIZING ENCOUNTER TYPES
To categorize time blocks by clinical work activities,1,3,22 we used the types of EHR fields 
accessed within each time block. Our mapping of Epic encounter types to the categories of 
physician work follows the approach used by Richard Baron,22 whose categories were face-
to-face ambulatory care visits,
This method of analyzing physician work has far-reaching implications for 
payment reform.
telephone calls, prescription refills, orders only, and secure messaging to patients. EHR 
access was considered to have occurred during a face-to-face visit if it was made from an 
exam room on a day when the patient saw the physician. Some of the documentation 
reviewed during visits might have been for services provided elsewhere. For example, during 
a face-to-face visit, a physician might review EHR documentation related to hospital-based 
services that the patient had had in the past.
ESTIMATING FACE-TO-FACE VISIT TIME
To estimate the length of a face-to-face ambulatory care visit, we used the time of the first 
EHR transaction and the time of the last EHR transaction for that patient in an exam room 
on a day that the patient saw the physician (for examples of face-to-face time blocks, see 
Time Blocks B1, B2, and B4 in the Appendix).21
During a face-to-face visit, a physician often accessed the EHR soon after entering the exam 
room. For instance, he or she might access it while examining or talking to the patient (such 
as entering certain information or looking up certain lab values). To protect patients’ privacy, 
physicians almost always log out of the EHR before leaving the exam room. To examine the 
validity of this approach to estimating time spent face-to-face with patients, we compared 
visit lengths calculated by log data with two approaches: in-person observation, and audio 
recordings of visits. On average, the log-based estimates were two minutes shorter than 
those based on in-person observation and three minutes shorter than those based on audio 
recordings. For additional detailed information on this validation process, see the second and 
third paragraphs in the Appendix.21
DESKTOP MEDICINE
Physicians often access charts of patients with appointments before patients’ arrival to order 
tests; send staff messages; and review test results, prescriptions, or referrals. Phone calls 
related to patient care are often documented as telephone encounters. While the duration of 
phone calls is not recorded, the time spent documenting the conversations in the EHR is 
recorded. Physicians perform similar tasks after patients depart: ordering tests, reviewing 
results, submitting referrals, and prescribing medications. Access via the Epic application 
Haiku was included in our measurements of desktop medicine.
MODELING
Descriptive analyses provided information on physicians’ activities as reflected in EHR logs. 
Linear regression with robust standard errors was used to analyze the association between 
EHR-recorded work time allocation and physicians’ characteristics, accounting for

 clustering of patients at the physician level. The dependent variables were the amounts of 
time spent on face-to-face visits and desktop medicine at the physician-day level. We 
adjusted for the number of years the physician had used the Epic-Care EHR; the physician’s 
sex, race, FTE time, and specialty (pediatrics, internal medicine, or family medicine); and 
average patient score on the Charlson Comorbidity Index.23 The clinic’s adoption of patient-
centered practices was measured by recognition by the National Committee on Quality 
Assurance (NCQA), with level 3 being the highest level of recognition and level 1 the 
lowest.24
Data management was completed in SAS, version 5.1. Analyses were conducted in both 
SAS Enterprise Guide, version 5.1, and Stata, version 13.1.
LIMITATIONS
We identified several limitations in this study. First, the estimates of time spent on some 
activities were imprecise. For example, if a physician did not use the HER at all during a 
face-to-face visit, our approach would not record any visit time. Likewise, time spent talking 
on the phone was not captured, nor was time spent on administrative tasks such as those 
related to insurance preauthorization and workers’ compensation cases.6 There was also the 
possibility of overestimating time if a physician walked away from the computer without 
logging out. Epic would force a logout after a period of inactivity, however. The health 
system also impresses upon all Epic users the importance of securing a computer (that is, 
logging out) whenever they need to step away from it, out of respect for patients’ privacy 
(for more information on how the health system addresses inactivity, see the last section of 
the Appendix).21
Second, we treated time “gaps” conservatively by not allocating them to the care of any 
patient, although it is quite likely that physicians spent some of those gaps providing patient 
care (for example, accessing the EHR only after some initial conversation with the patient).
Third, NCQA recognition is a composite measure of the adoption of patient-centered care 
processes. We did not draw causal inferences about the relationship between providing 
patient-centered care and time allocation.
Lastly, the individual health care system in our analysis was an early adopter of EHR and 
uses many EHR functions. The results might not be generalizable to later adopters or those 
that use fewer functions.25
Study Results
We analyzed 31,002,888 distinct physician-patient-location time blocks logged by 471 
physicians through three types of access locations: exam rooms, physicians’ clinic desktop 
computers, or secure remote computers or other secure devices.
TIME SPENT ON CLINICAL ACTIVITIES
The average daily total logged time was 3.08 hours for face-to-face and 3.17 hours for 
desktop medicine, for a sum of 6.25 hours (Exhibit 1). For purposes of comparison, the

 average number of visits per physician per day was 12.3 (median: 12; standard deviation: 
5.3) (data not shown). The average number of visits per physician per day was 9.5 (SD: 4.9) 
for physicians whose FTE was 50 percent or less, 12.1 (SD: 5.2) for those whose FTE was 
greater than 50 percent and less than 75 percent, and 12.9 (SD: 5.3) for those whose FTE 
was at least 75 percent. On average, 15.0 (SD: 10.7) minutes were recorded for a face-to-
face visit in the exam room.
Of the time spent on desktop medicine, an average of 2.82 hours was spent in the clinic, with 
1.42 hours spent on patients who were seen on the same day and 1.40 hours spent on other 
patients (Exhibit 1). An average of 0.35 hour was spent on secure remote computers, 0.14 
hour for patients who were seen on the same day and 0.21 hour for other patients. The 
primary desktop medicine activity both in the clinic and remotely was typing progress notes. 
Physicians generally spent more time on progress notes in the clinic on visit days. Other 
desktop medicine activities, in descending order of time allotted, were logging telephone 
encounters, exchanging secure messages with patients, and refilling prescriptions. Common 
desktop medicine activities for patients not seen that day were orders for services, chart 
reviews, letters for external use, and scanned documents.
Exhibit 2 displays the distribution of time among face-to-face visits (49 percent) and desktop 
medicine (51 percent).The desktop medicine portion consists of 34 percent spent on progress 
notes, 9 percent on documenting telephone encounters, 3 percent on secure message to 
patients, 2 percent on prescription refills, and 3 percent on other tasks.
TIME ALLOCATION PATTERNS AND PHYSICIAN CHARACTERISTICS
Time allocations for internists and family physicians were roughly comparable, and both 
recorded more time than pediatricians did on face-to-face visits and desktop medicine 
(Exhibit 3). For example, internists spent 3.26 hours on face-to-face visits, family physicians 
spent 3.20 hours, and pediatricians spent 2.72 hours.
The average recorded face-to-face and desktop medicine time per physician per day also 
differed across clinics with different NCQA recognition levels. Physicians at clinics with 
level 3 or level 2 recognition recorded more mean face-to-face hours (3.15 hours in both 
cases) than those at clinics that didn’t apply for NCQA recognition (2.87 hours). However, 
the average recorded desktop medicine time for physicians at clinics that did not apply for 
NCQA recognition (3.47 hours) was higher than for physicians at clinics with level 2 or 
level 3 recognition (3.29 hours and 2.95 hours, respectively).
Having more years of experience using the EHR was associated with slightly less time spent 
on desktop medicine (coefficient: −0.04). It is not surprising that physicians whose FTE was 
50 percent or less spent less logged time in face-to-face visits (coefficient: −0.51) than 
physicians whose FTE was 75 percent or higher (Exhibit 4). However, there was no 
significant difference between physicians in the 50 to <75 percent FTE group (coefficient: 
−0.10) and those in the 75 percent or higher FTE group. With respect to time allocated to 
desktop medicine, physicians with <75 percent FTE spent less time on desktop medicine in 
comparison to those in the 75 percent or higher FTE group.

 Compared to physicians at clinics with level 3 NCQA recognition, those at clinics that did 
not apply for NCQA recognition recorded less face-to-face time (coefficients: −0.44) but 
more desktop medicine time (coefficient: 0.25). Compared to 2011, in 2012 and 2013 the 
recorded face-to-face time was shorter (coefficients: −0.11 and −0.16, respectively), while in 
2012 and 2014 the recorded desktop medicine time was longer (coefficients: 0.15 and 0.34, 
respectively).
Discussion
This is one of the first studies to use EHR access logs that identify discrete, time-stamped 
activities to account at least partially for how physicians allocate their time. The time 
recorded for desktop medicine corroborates previous reports of the extensive time spent by 
physicians on activities outside of direct face-to-face visits.6,9–11 Our results suggest that 
physicians spent comparable time in face-to-face visits (3.08 hours per day) and desktop 
medicine (3.17 hours per day). If we add three minutes to face-to-face visit time to account 
for the time between entry and first login and the time between last logout and exit, the 
average visit length comes to about 18.0 minutes, which is consistent with the literature.7 
Multiplying 18 minutes by 12.3 (the average number of visits per day) gives us an average of 
3.69 hours per day spent on face-to-face visits. We acknowledge, however, that this approach 
omits work efforts that were not captured by log data, such as phone calls and searching for 
answers to patients’ questions. Findings from a recent direct-observation study of fifty-seven 
physicians sponsored by the American Medical Association (AMA) showed that about 19.9 
percent of physicians’ time per day was spent on tasks other than direct clinical face time, 
EHR and desk work, and administrative tasks, including personal time, transit time within 
the clinic, and unobserved work.6 Combining those results with our findings produces an 
approximation of how physicians spend time in ambulatory practice in the age of EHRs and 
patient portals: 40 percent is spent on face-to-face visits, 40 percent on desktop medicine, 
and 20 percent on other activities that are not logged in the EHR.
The logs suggest that physicians allocate equal amounts of their clinically active time to 
desktop medicine work and to face-to-face ambulatory care visits. While working on 
progress notes could be considered pre- or post-service efforts,5 desktop medicine activities 
not linked to a face-to-face visit are not reimbursable under typical fee-for-service 
contractual and regulatory arrangements. Many of those activities—such as care 
coordination and responding to patients’ e-mail—are of high value to the delivery system 
and to patients, so the staffing, scheduling, and design of primary care practices should 
reflect this value.
Physician burnout with EHR use has been well documented.25,26 Some organizations are 
using medical scribes to reduce documentation burden.27 Intriguing findings from the recent 
AMA study on five specialists who had scribes (with their own user identification) suggested 
that those specialists spent 43.9 percent of their time on face-to-face visits, compared to 23.1 
percent among specialists without scribes.6 Clearly, more studies (preferably with more 
physicians teamed up with scribes) on the impact of scribes are needed. Our data suggested 
that 34 percent of logged time (2.10/6.25, based on data shown in Exhibit 1) was spent on 
progress notes. Having scribes support this effort could potentially remove one-third of

 physicians’ work efforts and might reduce burnout.25 User-specific log data can be used to 
inform organizations about how scribes as new members of the care team could reduce the 
time physicians spend on documentation and whether this would increase the time they 
spend with patients, either face to face or virtually. Furthermore, some organizations offer 
EHR optimization training for physicians to improve their efficiency in using EHRs.25 Log 
data could be used to evaluate the impact of these efforts.
IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH
Estimating the time needed for various processes of care has long been an active research 
area.2,7,28,29 Some researchers have suggested using the time-driven activity-based costing 
method,29 by asking physicians to use electronic hand-held bar-code or radio frequency 
identification devices to capture actual times spent on various activities. However, 
physicians’ receptivity to such approaches is not clear. The unobtrusively collected access 
log data, while not as precise as those provided by the time-driven activity-based costing 
method, the process of collecting the log data may be more acceptable to physicians than the 
process of collecting the other data.
This method of analyzing physician work has far-reaching implications for payment reform. 
While it may be good or bad that physicians are spending more time documenting care and 
communicating with other staff members than they are in face-to-face visits with patients, 
that fact highlights the misalignment of a payment policy that reimburses only office visits, 
lab work, and procedures while overlooking much of desktop medicine work.
IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY
Twenty-four years after the implementation of the RBRVS-based Medicare Fee Schedule, 
the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 established a new framework 
for Medicare physician payment: the Quality Payment Program. In this program, physicians 
have two tracks to choose from: the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System and the 
Advanced Alternative Payment Models.30 Furthermore, CMS has also launched the 
Comprehensive Primary Care Plus model.31 The model has a separate track for practices 
with relatively more experience in delivering advanced primary care. These practices will 
receive a hybrid payment of a per beneficiary per month care management fee and fee-for-
service payment for claims for evaluation and management services.31 Under this hybrid 
payment model, practices will have the flexibility to deliver care in the manner that best 
meets patients’ needs, without being tied to the office visit. This is an explicit move away 
from payment for visits only, and an acknowledgment that critical aspects of patient care 
that happen outside the visit require appropriate compensation.
Our research provides empirical data that support this change in physician payment policy. 
Of the 765,129 patients whose EHRs were accessed by the 471 physicians in the four years 
of our study, only 637,769 had one or more face-to-face visits. The remaining 127,360 
patients received desktop medicine service only. Moreover, consumers increasingly prefer 
services other than face-to-face visits: A recent survey of several thousand Americans found 
that 74 percent preferred “virtual” encounters to face-to-face office visits.32 Our results 
showed that activities associated with virtual encounters included telephone encounters 
Tai-Seale et al.

 (documenting telephone encounters took up 9 percent of physicians’ logged time), 
communicating with patients via the secure patient portal (3 percent), and refilling 
prescriptions (2 percent). Compensation models should make delivering services in ways 
that meet patients’ preferences the easy thing to do.
CMS has indicated its intention to monitor practices to ensure the delivery of high-quality 
health care under the Comprehensive Primary Care Plus model. Access logs provide a 
simple and unobtrusive way for health care delivery systems to examine how their clinicians 
spend a significant portion of their time. The effective use of such data can help create true 
learning health systems capable of assessing how best to deploy clinical and other resources 
to maximize the value of their services to patients.
