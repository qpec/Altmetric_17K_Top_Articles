background Being married is associated with healthier 
lifestyle behaviours and lower mortality and may 
reduce risk for dementia due to life-course factors. We 
conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 
studies of the association between marital status and the 
risk of developing dementia.
Methods We searched medical databases and 
contacted experts in the field for relevant studies 
reporting the relationship, adjusted for age and sex, 
between marital status and dementia. We rated 
methodological quality and conducted random-effects 
meta-analyses to summarise relative risks of being 
widowed, divorced or lifelong single, compared with 
being married. secondary stratified analyses with meta-
regression examined the impact of clinical and social 
context and study methodology on findings.
results We included 15 studies with 812 047 
participants. compared with those who are married, 
lifelong single (relative risk=1.42 (95% cI 1.07 to 
1.90)) and widowed (1.20 (1.02 to 1.41)) people have 
elevated risk of dementia. We did not find an association 
in divorced people. Further analyses showed that less 
education partially confounds the risk in widowhood 
and worse physical health the elevated risk in lifelong 
single people. compared with studies that used clinical 
registers for ascertaining dementia diagnoses, those 
which clinically examined all participants found higher 
risk for being unmarried.
Conclusions Being married is associated with reduced 
risk of dementia than widowed and lifelong single 
people, who are also underdiagnosed in routine clinical 
practice. Dementia prevention in unmarried people 
should focus on education and physical health and 
should consider the possible effect of social engagement 
as a modifiable risk factor.
InTroduCTIon
The rising number of people living with dementia1 
makes it the current global public health priority,2 
and there is a pressing need to identify modifiable 
risk factors. Although there are more people with 
dementia overall, there has been a small decline in the 
age-specific incidence of dementia in many developed 
countries3 4 over the past two decades suggesting that 
differential lifetime exposure to risk factors in succes-
sive generations affects their dementia risk.4 
Marital status has potential to affect dementia 
risk by increasing daily social interaction. This 
may improve cognitive reserve, meaning that 
an individual has a greater ability to cope with 
neuropathological damage by using compensatory 
cognitive approaches from a physically more resil-
ient brain to maintain cognitive ability and daily 
function.5 Marriage may result in more frequent 
social contact, which is associated with reduced 
dementia risk,6 and reduced harmful lifestyle 
behaviours.7 8 Bereavement or divorce in people 
who had been married may promote dementia 
development through stress, which is patho-
genic9 and associated with increased dementia 
risk.10 Being unmarried is associated with adverse 
health behaviours7 and a range of poorer health 
outcomes. A meta-analysis of observational studies 
found lower mortality for married than unmarried 
people11; health of unmarried Americans is worse 
than that of married people8; being married is 
related to improved cancer survival12; and widow-
hood is associated with disability in older people.13
In this study, we aim to synthesise evidence from 
published studies examining the effect of marital 
status (married/cohabiting, widowed, divorced/
separated and lifelong single) on dementia inci-
dence and the extent to which this risk is modified 
by sociodemographic factors, study design and 
methodological quality of the study. We hypothe-
sise that married people are at lower risk of devel-
oping dementia compared with unmarried people 
and that previously married people are at lower risk 
than those who have been lifelong single.

search strategy
We searched Embase, MEDLINE and PsycInfo data-
bases from their inception to 5 December 2016. Our 
search terms (online supplementary table 1) identified 
papers whose titles, abstracts or keywords included 
terms encompassing marital status and dementia, 
and we used the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines 
Network filters for observational studies (http://www. 
sign. 
ac. 
uk/ 
methodology/ 
filters. 
html). We searched 
references of included studies and systematic reviews 
and contacted two experts in this field aiming to iden-
tify additional studies.

When two studies reported different analyses of cohort

had a longer follow-up duration.
data extraction
One researcher (AS) screened the abstracts of all studies to identify 
those potentially meeting the inclusion criteria and reviewed full-
text articles to confirm eligibility. A second researcher (JR) reviewed 
a random sample of 10% of the studies to assess agreement and 
reviewed all included studies to approve eligibility. We used a stan-
dardised form (online supplementary table 2) to extract data for 
evidence synthesis. Extracted information included results and 
information for the assessment of the risk of bias.
In the one study14 that used lifelong single people as the 
reference group, we inverted the ORs, and for this study and 
another,15 we calculated CIs based on raw published data.16 
Where marital status categories had been combined (eg, divorced 
and single people) or results for dementia subtypes rather than 
all-cause dementia presented, we requested additional data from 
study authors. We have included new data for three papers.17–19
We registered the study protocol prospectively in the PROS-
PERO register of systematic reviews (http://www.

Quality rating
We rated methodological quality of included studies using an 
adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Criteria20 for cohort 
and case–control studies and the Joanna Briggs Institute’s Check-
list21 for cross-sectional studies. Full details are in online supple-
mentary tables 3a–c but, in summary, these tools rated the quality 
of selection, measurement and comparability for all studies and 
gave a score for cohort and case–control studies (maximum of 
9) and cross-sectional studies (maximum 6). T
wo researchers (AS 
and JR) assessed the quality of all included studies and discussed 
discrepancies until consensus was reached.
statistical analysis
We provide a narrative synthesis of findings from included 
studies and have pooled results where studies have used the 
same measurements, calculating random-effects estimates using 
STATA V
.14. The random-effects model allows for HRs and ORs 
to be incorporated into the same meta-analysis22 and accounts for 
heterogeneity between studies.23 All included studies provided an 
estimate of relative risk and CI that we used for the analysis. We 
measured heterogeneity between the studies using the χ2 test and 
the I2 statistic and considered, a priori, that I2 >50% indicated 
substantial heterogeneity. Where studies provided estimates of 
relative risk from different multivariate models, we included the 
result from the model with the largest number of covariates.
Our main analyses compared risk of all-cause dementia in 
married people to those who were widowed, divorced or life-
long single for studies that ascertained dementia diagnosis status 
from clinical assessment. We conducted prespecified secondary 
analyses. We analysed the association between marital status and 
risk of Alzheimer’s or vascular dementia. We conducted strati-
fied analyses and used meta-regression24 to quantify the effect of 
various study design factors on the association between marital 
status and all-cause mortality: (1) dementia case ascertainment 
method: clinical assessment of study participants versus clinical 
register data; (2) study type: cohort versus other studies; (3) 
study quality rating; and (4) time period of study conduct, based 
on mean year of birth of study participants.
We assessed the effect of confounder adjustment on the rela-
tive risk using stratified analyses of studies that adjusted only 
for age and sex versus studies that additionally adjusted for 
education or baseline cognition versus studies that additionally 
adjusted for physical health. We assessed for evidence of publi-
cation bias using funnel plots and Egger’s weighted regression 
method.25
resulTs
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and 
Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) diagram (figure 1) shows our search 
results and reasons for study exclusion. Sixteen studies fulfilled 
our inclusion criteria, but we excluded one publication26 from 
our meta-analysis as it reported data from the same cohort as 
another study27 but with shorter follow-up. The 15 studies in 
our analyses included 812 
047 people, of whom 29 
610 had any 
form of dementia. Of these, 61 
012 had a clinical assessment 
for dementia and 751 
035 had dementia status ascertained from 
clinical records.
Table 1 describes key study characteristics. Nine were cohort 
studies,17–19 27–32 two case–control14 15 and four cross-sec-
tional.33–36 Eight included studies were set in European coun-
tries, four in Asia, two from USA and one from Brazil. The 
mean year of birth of study participants ranged from 1897 to 
1939. Studies typically measured marital status at study incep-
tion (mean age 72.8 (SD 7.2) years.) In the cohort studies, the 
duration of follow-up before dementia assessment was 3 to 20.9 
(mean 8.5, SD 5.5) years.
Married people accounted for between 27.8% and 80.1% of the 
sample (widowed=7.8% to 48.0%, divorced=0% 
to 16%, lifelong 
single=0% to 32.6%). T
wo studies34 36 combined divorced and life-
long single people (6.1% and 10.1%). The mean methodological 
quality score for the cohort studies was 5.4/9, 2/9 for case–control 
studies and 3.8/6 for cross-sectional studies. Full details of meth-
odological assessment are in online supplementary tables 3a–c. All 
included cohort studies analysed complete cases, excluding partici-
pants who had withdrawn from study.
Marital status was, in all but two of the cohort studies30 32 which 
used registry data, reported by the participant or a close informant. 
No studies provided further details about this assessment nor was 
there any information on duration of exposure to a particular 
marital status category. In one cohort study,32 marital status was 
ascertained from a Swedish central population register, and in 
another cohort,30 a marriage registry was used to confirm marital 
status. For the two case–control studies, those with dementia (or,

marital status at age 30 and 50 years and 10 years prior to inter-
view14 or at time of diagnosis.15
All but three of the studies clinically examined all partic-
ipants for ascertaining diagnostic status (outcome). The other 
studies14 15 32 ascertained diagnostic status from routine clinical 
registers and, for one of these studies,32 death registers. Except 
for the cohort study32 that exclusively used register data, none 
reported whether they ascertained dementia status from death 
registers. The clinical examination used in the majority of studies 
was a staged approach: a screening phase followed by a more 
detailed neuropsychological and functional assessment and an 
expert consensus panel to establish diagnostic status.
Main meta-analysis: widowed, divorced or lifelong single 
versus married people and risk of all-cause dementia
We pooled risk estimates from studies that evaluated the risk 
of all-cause dementia according to marital status category, with 
dementia case ascertainment based on clinical examination 
(figure 2). Nine studies analysed the risk of all-cause dementia in 
widowed versus married people and we found that in widowed, 
compared with married, people, the relative risk of dementia=1.20 
(95% CI 1.02 to 1.41). The relative risk for divorced versus 
married people from seven studies=0.99 (0.71 to 1.37) and for the 
six studies that analysed dementia risk for lifelong single people, 
RR=1.42 (1.07 to 1.90).
secondary analyses
Widowed, divorced or lifelong single versus married people and risk 
of Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia
Fewer studies examined the risk of dementia subtypes according to 
marital status. Eight14 15 17 27 29 30 35 36 examined the risk of Alzhei-
mer’s disease (1891 cases) in widowed versus married people and 
found a pooled relative risk of 1.24 (0.97 to 1.60). The risk of 
Alzheimer’s disease in five14 15 27 30 35 studies of divorced (0.89 (0.58 
to 1.36)) and three15 27 35 of lifelong single (1.07 (0.75 to 1.52)) 
people was not different to that of married people. For vascular 
dementia (372 cases), no effect of marital status on dementia risk 
was found in pooled estimates from the three studies14 35 36 that 
examined the risk for widowed versus married people (pooled 
RR=0.90 (0.40 to 2.04)) or the two14 35 studies that examined risk 
in lifelong single people versus married (2.66 (0.85 to 8.28)). Only 
one study14 compared the risk of vascular dementia in divorced and 
married people and found no difference.
Widowed, divorced or lifelong single versus married people and risk 
of all-cause dementia stratified by sex
Two studies (online supplementary table 2) analysed the rela-
tionship between marital status and dementia separately for 
men and women. For one study,32 the outcome was all-cause 
dementia, and for the other,15 it was Alzheimer’s disease

so meta-analysis was not possible. Neither study found any 
difference between men and women in the association of 
marital status and dementia.
Impact of study design on association between marital status and 
all-cause dementia
Widowed, divorced or lifelong single versus married people and risk 
of all-cause dementia stratified by case ascertainment method
There was evidence that the method of dementia case ascer-
tainment affected the risk estimates (table 2). Studies using clin-
ical examination for dementia ascertainment produced higher 
pooled estimates for the effect of being widowed (1.20 (1.02 to 
1.41) versus 1.12 (1.07 to 1.18)) or lifelong single (1.42 (1.07 
to 1.90) versus 1.23 (1.17 to 1.29)), and this difference nearly 
reached significance for the comparison of single and married 
people (p=0.06). The risk of dementia for divorced compared 
with married people was slightly lower but neither risk estimate 
was significant.
Widowed, divorced or lifelong single versus married people and risk 
of all-cause dementia stratified by study type
The pooled risk estimate (table 2) for dementia in widowed 
versus married people was lower (meta-regression: p=0.004) 
from the seven cohort studies17–19 27 30–32 (1.10 (1.05 to 1.28))

than the four cross-sectional or case–control studies14 33 34 36 
(1.39 (1.16 to 1.67)) that examined this association. There were 
no differences between cohort and other studies in pooled esti-
mates of dementia risk in lifelong single versus married people 
or divorced versus married people.
Widowed, divorced or lifelong single versus married people and risk 
of all-cause dementia stratified by study quality
Stratified analyses of higher versus lower quality studies and 
meta-regression analysis of the effect of study quality on risk 
estimates found no effect of study quality on relative risk for 
widowed or lifelong single people. The four higher quality 
studies19 30–32 produced a slightly increased risk for divorced 
people than the five lower quality studies14 18 27 33 35 but in 
neither strata was divorce related to dementia risk.
Widowed, divorced or lifelong single versus married people and risk 
of all-cause dementia by time period
Meta-regression analysis suggested that the relative risk of 
dementia in divorced people increased by 24% (95% CI 1% to 
47%) for studies of participants born 10 years later (table 2), 
although risk remained non-significant when comparing 
the newer and older studies. There was some evidence that 
time period modified the effect of being lifelong single on risk of 
dementia: the risk of dementia in single people was 15% lower 
(9% 
CI 33% lower to 2% higher) for every 10 years later that 
participants were born. In the oldest studies (participants born 
on average before 1927), the risk of dementia in lifelong single 
versus married people was 1.40 (1.06 to 1.85) and for the most 
recent studies (of people born after 1927), the risk was 1.24 
(0.94 to 1.62). No significant modifying effect of time period 
was found for the risk of dementia in widowed people.
Effect of covariate adjustment on risk estimates
For dementia risk in widowed versus married people, the pooled 
risk estimates (table 3) from the three studies17 18 31 that adjusted 
only for age and sex (1.33 (1.05 to 1.69)) was higher than the 
five studies14 19 30 33 35 that adjusted additionally for education 
or baseline cognitive function (1.12 (0.95 to 1.31)). No further 
attenuation of the effect was found in three studies27 32 34 that 
additionally adjusted for physical health (1.12 (0.92 to 1.37)).
For lifelong single people, the risk estimate for dementia was 
not affected by adjustment for education, but the relative risk of 
dementia in single versus married people fell from 1.45 (0.97 to 
2.19) to 1.23 (1.17 to 1.29) in studies that adjusted for physical 
health.
Publication bias
In funnel plots (online supplementary figure 1), there was no clear 
evidence of asymmetry suggesting publication bias. Weighted 
regression (Egger) test indicated that there was unlikely to be 
publication bias in studies examining widowed (p=0.30) or life-
long single (p=0.35) people but that there may have been for 
studies of divorced people (p=0.04).
dIsCussIon
Our study summarised all accessible published evidence and 
found that people who are lifelong single have a 42% higher 
risk and that those who are widowed have a 20% higher risk 
of developing dementia than those who are married in studies 
adjusted for age and sex. We found no evidence that dementia 
risk in divorced people differs from married people. The 
reduced risk in married people persisted in sensitivity analyses, 
indicating the robustness of the findings. Similar direction and 
magnitude of effect were found for dementia subtypes, but these

estimates were non-significant as these analyses had fewer partic-
ipants. Study design affects estimates of dementia risk. Higher 
relative risk of dementia for lifelong single and widowed people 
was found in studies that diagnosed dementia following clinical 
examination of all participants than in those that ascertained 
diagnostic status from routinely collected data; and lower risk 
was found for widowed people in cohort studies than in case–
control or cross-sectional studies. There is some indication that 
the elevated risk in lifelong single people has decreased over 
time, with more recent studies finding smaller associations. We 
find that much of the increased risk in widowed people is atten-
uated after adjustment for education and that confounding by 
physical health explains part of the increased risk of dementia in 
lifelong single people.
Our findings may be explained in one or more ways. First, 
being married may change individuals’ exposure to other protec-
tive and risk factors throughout their subsequent lifespan; this is 
supported by our identification of confounding factors affecting 
this risk and evidence showing married people to be more likely 
to have a healthy lifestyle. The residual increased risk for lifelong 
single people in studies that adjusted for age, sex, education and 
physical health is likely to be due to different social engagement 
in married and single people,37 which may contribute to building 
cognitive reserve and reducing dementia risk6 over the lifespan. 
The magnitude of effect of marital status on dementia is higher 
than the risk for mortality in unmarried compared with married 
people (RR=1.1),11 supporting the idea that marriage’s effect on 
dementia risk is more than just improving physical health and 
that there may a direct cognitive benefit of being married.
Second, the end of marriage through bereavement could 
act directly to increase dementia risk, through the detrimental 
effect of stress on hippocampal neurons9 or cognition,10 and 
this theory could explain the increased dementia risk for 
widowed, but not divorced, people, as studies have found 
widowhood to be more stressful than divorce.38 39 Third, 
developing dementia could be related to other underlying 
cognitive or personality traits meaning that in societies where 
marriage was the social norm, people with difficulties in flex-
ibility of thought or communication and consequent smaller 
lifelong cognitive reserve (therefore more likely to develop 
dementia) may be less likely to marry. This explanation may 
be supported by our finding that the risk for lifelong single 
people is possibly reduced in more recent times. Remaining 
unmarried has become more common,40 41 and it may be that 
single people born in the latter half of the 20thcentury have 
fewer unusual cognitive and personality characteristics.
Our findings, from large populations, across numerous coun-
tries and time periods are the strongest evidence yet that married 
people are less likely to develop dementia. We searched the liter-
ature systematically, sought additional studies where possible 
by contacting authors to gain additional data where published 
information was insufficient and followed PRISMA guidance in 
the conduct and reporting of this study.42 The main limitations 
of this review relate to the methodology of included studies. We 
could not investigate the effect of the duration of being widowed 
or divorced as the included studies did not report this, and we 
could only investigate the impact of potential confounders that 
were measured and analysed in studies, limiting our investiga-
tion of potential explanations for our findings. Our findings in 
relation to divorced people are less robust as there were fewer 
divorced people in the included studies. While our search terms 
were thorough, supporting our belief that we identified all 
studies examining this relationship, we may have missed eligible 
studies. This is a particular risk for observational studies exam-
ining the effect of other exposures on dementia risk, which may 
have reported marital status as a potential covariate, although 
less likely for this review as we aimed to only include studies that 
adjusted the relationship between marital status and dementia 
for age and sex.
Our finding of a 42% increased risk in lifelong single people 
compares closely to other known dementia risk factors incor-
porated in National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
guidelines43 such as physical inactivity (RR=1.4) and less educa-
tion, hypertension or smoking (RR for each=1.6).44 Our find-
ings support the need for further work to develop preventative 
approaches in these lifestyle domains and indicate this may be 
particularly important for the high-risk groups of widowed and 
lifelong single people.
We also found that routine clinical registers underestimate the 
risk of dementia in these groups, which is likely to be because 
register data has poor sensitivity for detecting dementia45 and 
unmarried people are more likely to be undiagnosed in routine 
practice.46 Diagnosing dementia in people who attend clinic 
alone is more difficult, due to lack of collateral information and 
because individuals with dementia may not complain of memory 
impairment,47 so clinicians should have a high index of suspicion 
for dementia in these groups.
Future research should explore the mechanism of the relation-
ship between marital status and dementia in order to develop 
interventions. It should, in particular, evaluate the contribution 
of social contact and health behaviours; use studies with suffi-
cient follow-up to allow exploration of premarriage cognitive 
characteristics; and use cohort studies with sufficient detail on 
the duration of marriage, widowhood or divorce to allow the 
exploration of a dose–response effect.
