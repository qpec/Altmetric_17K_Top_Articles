ABSTRACT
Influenza B strains represent on average 23% of all circulating strains in Europe and when there is a vaccine
mismatch on B strains, additional influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths as well as substantial
additional costs are observed. The objective was to estimate the public health and economic impact of
seasonal influenza vaccination with quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIV) compared to trivalent influenza
vaccines (TIV) in Europe (EU).
Based on data from 5 EU countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK) during 10 influenza seasons
from 2002 to 2013, epidemiological and associated economic outcomes were estimated for each season
for the actual scenario where the TIV was used, and for a hypothetical scenario where QIV could have
been used instead.
By using QIV, this study estimated that for the 5 EU countries, an additional 1.03 million (327.9/100,000
inhabitants) influenza cases, 453,000 (143.9/100,000) general practitioners consultations, 672,000 (213.1/
100,000) workdays lost, 24,000 (7.7/100,000) hospitalizations and 10,000 (3.1/100,000) deaths could have
been avoided compared to the use of TIV over the 10-seasons-period. This study estimates that QIV can be
of economic value since from a societal perspective 15 million Euros would have been saved on general
practitioners consultations (14 million Euros from third-party payer perspective), 77 million on
hospitalizations (74 million Euros from third-party payer perspective) and 150 million Euros on workdays
lost, across the 5 EU countries.
In conclusion, the present study estimates that, compared to TIV, QIV may result in a substantial
decrease in epidemiological burden and in influenza-related costs.

Introduction
Influenza is a highly infectious viral illness causing significant
morbidity and mortality among high risk populations, includ-
ing the elderly,1,2 pregnant women,3 children,4 persons with
specific underlying health conditions 5 and healthcare workers.6
Annual epidemics result in about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths
worldwide7 and an average of 38,500 estimated deaths in
Europe8 but with considerable season-to-season variation.
Influenza occurs globally with an annual attack rate estimated
between 5%–10% in adults and between 20%–30% in children.7
Mild and moderate influenza cases have a substantial socio-
economic impact in terms of medical care, healthcare utiliza-
tion (e.g. increase in consultations, hospitalizations and length
of stay) and work absenteeism. The total estimated direct and
indirect costs of an influenza epidemic in high income coun-
tries may reach €56.7 million per million people.9 The cost of
primary care physician visits due to influenza for all EU
25 countries in 2005 was estimated at €267.2 million and the
cost of hospital visits at €11.5 billion.10 In Europe, influenza is
responsible for approximately 10% of sickness related absence
from work,11 while the cost of lost productivity due to influenza
in France and Germany alone has been estimated at between
€6.4 billion to €9.8 billion per year.12
Vaccination is currently the most effective means of pre-
venting influenza infection. Since the adoption of the EU
council recommendation on seasonal flu vaccination in
2009,13 almost all member states have national and/or
regional vaccination policies for seasonal influenza that typ-
ically target groups with higher susceptibility to infection
and greater risk of complications. Several types of influenza
vaccine are available in the EU, including live-attenuated or
inactivated formulations with or without adjuvant, offering
the option of intramuscular, nasal or intradermal delivery
routes and now also containing either 3 (TIV) or 4 (QIV)
strains. The specific strains to be included in seasonal influ-
enza vaccines are predicted annually by the WHO. Trivalent
vaccines which include 2 strains of influenza A (H1N1 and
H3N2) and one lineage of the influenza B virus (Yamagata

 or Victoria) are currently the most widely used flu vaccines
in Europe.
Surveillance data show that B strains represent on average
23% (1% to 60%) of all circulating strains in Europe.1 The
Yamagata and Victoria lineages of influenza B co-circulate dur-
ing each influenza season in Europe since 2001,14-17 with one
lineage dominating the other in many seasons. Predicting
which lineage will predominate can be challenging, and in
some seasons, the lineage chosen for the vaccine has differed
from the predominant circulating influenza B virus lineage, as
it has been reported in Europe and the US.1,18
When there is a vaccine mismatch, the responses against the
heterologous B virus are significantly reduced which decreases
the expected benefits from the vaccines,19 leading to increased
influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths,20 and resulting in
substantial additional costs associated with influenza B21 across
all age groups.
Consequently, quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIV) that
include a second influenza B strain have been developed, and
are expected to be increasingly available in Europe over the fol-
lowing years. By minimizing the possible mismatch of vaccine
and disease-causing strains, QIV alleviates the unpredictability
of B strain circulation and contributes to control of infections
caused by influenza B.
In 2012, the public health impact that QIV would have had
on influenza-related health outcomes over 10 influenza seasons,
had QIV been used instead of TIV in the United States had
been estimated.22 The authors concluded that additional pro-
tection provided by QIV including a second lineage of influenza
B could have resulted in the reduction of influenza-associated
outcomes. Generalization of these results to other countries is
possible but it is unclear how much additional public health
benefit would be gained in Europe by including a second influ-
enza B strain in the vaccine.
The objective of this study was to retrospectively esti-
mate the public health impact that QIV could have poten-
tially had on influenza-related health outcomes over 10
previous influenza seasons, if QIV had been used instead of
TIV in Europe.
Results
Epidemiological burden averted
The additional epidemiological burden averted by the use of QIV
instead of TIV is presented in Table 1. For the 5 EU countries
over the 10-seasons period, the total number of additional cases
avoided by the use of QIV instead of TIV was 1 million (327.9/
100,000), distributed from 150,000 in Spain to 230,000 in Italy
and and UK. A total of 670,000 (213.1/100,000) workdays lost
could be additionally avoided by the use of QIV instead of TIV,
distributed from 19,000 in Spain to 250,000 in Germany. A total
of 450,000 (143.9/100,000) additional GP consultations could
also be additionally avoided by QIV compared to TIV at the
EU-5 level. Total EU-5 hospitalizations and deaths due to influ-
enza additionally avoided by the use of QIV were 24,000 (7.7/
100,000) and 10,000 (3.1/100,000) respectively.
Table 6 presented the additional epidemiological burden
averted by the use of QIV instead of TIV, by age-group for the
5 EU countries. Most of the cases (393,270), GP consultations
(142,902), hospitalizations (21,151) and deaths additionally
avoided (9,391) by the use of QIV instead of TIV were in the
65C age group. Incidence results indicates that the greater
impact would be for 6 m-< 2 yrs and 65C extreme age groups
with 604.0 and 663.1 additionally avoided cases per 100,000
respectively. Also, most workdays lost additionally avoided by
QIV were found in the 18–49 and 50–64 y population with
673.9 and 680.9 additionally avoided workdays lost per 100,000
respectively.
The number of influenza cases additionally avoided by the
use of QIV instead of TIV is depicted in Figure 1 according to
seasons. The figure demonstrates a great variability according
to seasons with less than 1,000 cases additionally avoided by
QIV for the 2002–03 and 2010–11 seasons compared to more
than 300,000 cases avoided during the 2005–06 and 2007–08
seasons.
Extrapolation of the results to the 27 EU countries led to a
total number of additional avoided cases by QIV of 1.6 million
(range of variation for ¡/C20% of vaccine effectiveness: 1.3 mil-
lion; 1,9 million], mostly in the 65C age group with 600,000

 [480,000;710,000]. Corresponding results for the number of
additional deaths avoided by the use of QIV instead of TIV
were 15,000 [11,000; 19,000] for the 27 EU countries, with
14,000 [11,000; 19,000] for the 65C age group.
Economic burden averted
The total economic burden additionally averted by the use of
QIV instead of TIV from the TPP and SP was €87.2 million
and €241.4 million, respectively. Details for GP costs, hospital-
izations costs and workdays lost costs by countries is presented
in Table 3. From the TPP, most of total costs additionally
avoided by QIV came from the 65C age group while from the
SP, costs additionally avoided by QIV were uniformly distrib-
uted across all age groups (Table 4), due to the substantial
impact of the additional avoided workdays lost (Fig. S1).
Indeed, 84% of costs avoided are hospital costs in the TPP per-
spective, while 63% of costs avoided are workdays saved costs
in the SP.
Figure 2 shows that the total costs additionally avoided by
QIV instead of TIV for the 5 EU countries varied greatly
according to the influenza season. But in 2005–06 and 2007–08,
total costs additionally avoided could have been considerable, if
QIV had been used instead of TIV, with more than €25 million
and more than €65 million additionally avoided for the TPP
and SP respectively.
Extrapolation to the 27 EU countries led to a total number
of additional avoided costs by QIV of €133.6 million [€100.2;
€171.8] for the TPP, mostly in the 65C age group with
€103.7 million [€77.1; €134.7]. For the SP, the total cost addi-
tionally avoided by QIV was €381.3 million [€292.9; €478.0]
mainly distributed in the 18–64 age group with €232.9 million
[€180.7; €288.7].
Sensitivity analysis
Results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in Figure 3
and 4. For avoided cases estimation per season (Fig. 3), the
most influential parameter was the vaccine coverage (from
82,437 cases in the low case scenario to 410,278 in the high
case scenario), followed by the vaccine effectiveness for mis-
matched B strain, increasing the number of influenza-related

 cases up to 145,371 in the low case scenario and decreasing
this outcome to 61,575 in the high case scenario, corre-
sponding to a variation of over a third around the base case
amount of influenza cases (103,473).
From the TPP perspective economic results (Fig. 4) were
most sensitive to the vaccine effectiveness for the mis-
matched B strain, with the average savings per season related
to the use of the QIV increasing up to €11.2 million for low
vaccine effectiveness for the mismatched B strain and
decreasing to €5.4 million for high vaccine effectiveness on
mismatched B strain. The main driver for SP (Fig. 4) were
the number of workdays lost per influenza-related consulta-
tion with the average savings per season implied by the
recourse
to
QIV
instead
of
TIV
increasing
up
to
€34,9 million for high values of this parameter and decreas-
ing to €13,4 million with low values. Results were then most
sensitive to the vaccine effectiveness both overall and for the
mismatched B strain.
Discussion
The objective of this study was to retrospectively estimate the
public health impact that QIV could have had on influenza-
related health outcomes and associated influenza costs over 10
previous influenza seasons, if QIV had been used instead of
TIV in Europe.
By substituting TIV with QIV, this study estimated that for
the 5 EU countries, 1.03 million (327.9/100,000) influenza
cases, 453,000 (143.9/100,000) GP consultations, 672,000
(213.1/100,000) workdays lost, 24,000 (7.7/100,000) hospital-
izations and 10,000 (3.1/100,000) deaths could have been addi-
tionally avoided over the 10-seasons-period. The largest
number of influenza-related events could have been avoided
among elderly people. High-risk groups and 65C generate
most of the savings as the vaccine coverage and the consequen-
ces if affected are more important than in the low-risk groups.
Consequently, this study suggests that, although seasonally
varying, substantial public health benefits could have been
achieved if QIV had been used instead of TIV from 2002 to
2013, excluding the 2009–2010 pandemic season. The benefits
estimated in this study are in agreement with studies conducted
in other countries.22-25 These results supports the 2012 WHO
recommendation to include a second influenza B strain from
opposite lineage in influenza vaccines and not to limit the pro-
duction and distribution of influenza vaccines to TIV.26,27
The results show the implementation of QIV instead of TIV
could have been associated with the avoidance of a significant eco-
nomic burden. Indeed, from SP 15 million Euros could have been
saved on GP consultations (14 million from TPP), 77 million on
Table 4. Total costs avoided for the 5 EU countries according to age and risk groups, and perspectives in million Euros for the 2002–03 to 2012–13 influenza seasons.

 hospitalizations (74 million from TPP) and 150 million on work-
days lost, across the 5 EU countries. Again, these numbers varied
greatly according to seasons and age groups. These economic bene-
fits compared to the TIV are in line with previous studies in other
countries.22,24,28,29 Although, vaccination costs were not considered
in the present study, existing literature suggests the public health
and economic burden averted by QIV could be important enough
to make this intervention cost-effective24,30 or even cost-saving31
compared to TIV.
Substantial season-by-season variability was observed in epi-
demiological and cost-related benefits. On a seasonal basis, our
model estimated logically that there could have been negligible
public health and economic benefit gained had QIV been used
instead of TIV when B circulation is low or when there was no
antigenic mismatch between circulating influenza virus B and
that in the vaccine for those years.
Influenza B mismatches were the strongest for seasons
2004–05, 2005–06, 2007–08, 2008–09 and 2012–13. Years
2005–06 and 2008–09 had also higher proportions of circulat-
ing influenza B virus. This resulted in significant numbers of
influenza-related events avoided with significant cost savings
made in these years if QIV had been used instead of TIV. Mis-
match arises from various mechanisms. Firstly, the level of
match between circulating and vaccine strains is difficult to
predict at the time of the strains selection (i.e. February of the
year for the influenza season of the year). Secondly, influenza
strains circulation differs from one place to another, which
means that a match could be observed in some regions, but not
in other regions. Lastly, Victoria and Yamagata lineages often
co-circulate during the same season.14 Using QIV instead of
TIV could overcome these situations.
The strength of our study lies in the quality of the inputs
used to populate the model. We collected up-to-date, country-
specific, EU-5 data from national sources for most of the eco-
nomic and epidemiological data, including seasonal influenza
data. In addition, our study took into account the variable
impact of influenza as we stratified by age and also took cross
protection against the B virus into account. Our analysis was
conducted over a large period from 2001 to 2013 with the
exclusion of the 2009–2010 pandemic season to avoid bias. The
comprehensive sensitivity analyses we conducted helped to
assess the impact of the uncertainty around VE estimates.32
Nevertheless, some limitations should be discussed. First,
attack rates were not available by age group and were estimated
using data from placebo arms of clinical trials and not observa-
tional data. Then, surveillance data are not collected using simi-
lar methods across the countries which can lead in a lack of
consistency between countries. Moreover, data are scarce
regarding cross-protection and herd immunity, the latter being
ignored in this study. To our knowledge, no clinical studies
directly studied the vaccine efficacy against matched and mis-
matched influenza B strains. So the data used in our study were
derived from 2 Lature reviews.33,34 The model assumes the
same severity for all influenza strains, a fixed VE and close
matching to serotypes which may continuously change over a
season or from year-to-year. While the hypothetical scenario
we used in this study can be theoretically plausible, there are no
empirical data yet to show benefit of QIV over TIV.
Plenty

have
been
reported in the literature covering a wide range of values.
In the study, we used age specific vaccine efficacy estimates
from meta-analysis.19,35-37 The comprehensive sensitivity
analyses we conducted helped to assess the impact of the
uncertainty around VE estimates on the study conclusions.
Besides, the evidence suggesting that the proportion of B
cases is lower among elderly, which is the group with high-
est risk of hospitalization and mortality may introduce an
overestimation of the benefits of QIV against hospitaliza-
tions and deaths.38 Finally, extrapolation to the 27 EU
countries was only based on population figures. Although
the 5 EU countries represent 2 thirds of the EU population,
it is unsure they are representative of the EU-27.
In conclusion, this study estimates that, compared to
TIV,
QIV

 epidemiological burden and influenza-related costs. More-
over, it would avoid the challenges of dealing with influenza
B lineages co-circulation and predicting which lineage of
influenza B will circulate in the upcoming seasons. This will
result in avoiding influenza related diseases and boosting
population confidence in influenza vaccines’ performance,
and increasing vaccination adoption closer to 75% coverage
rate for influenza as recommended by WHO.
Material and methods
Study period
The analysis covered 10 influenza seasons, from 2002–2003 to
2012–2013. Data for the pandemic influenza season 2009–2010
were excluded because the viral circulation in this season was
almost all H1N1 pandemic strain, rendering the year atypical
and introducing a bias.
Figure 4. Deterministic sensitivity analysis represented by tornado charts reports the effect of varying various parameters on the average cost savings per season accord-
ing to TPP and SP for the 5 EU countries during the 2002–03 to 2012–13 influenza seasons.

 Geographical scope
The primary analysis was conducted for France, Germany,
Italy, Spain and UK (EU-5). Indeed, these 5 countries were
selected because they represented about 2 thirds of the total
population of the European Union which comprise 27 coun-
tries. In addition, they contain a greater proportion of the num-
ber of vaccinated persons and more available data compared to
other countries. In a secondary analysis, the results were
extrapolated to the 27 countries of EU (EU-27: Austria,
Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy,
Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland,
Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, UK).
Study populations
The population numbers by age for all EU-5 countries were
obtained from Eurostat, 2012.39 To account for heterogeneity
between age groups in regard of attack rates, risks of complica-
tions, vaccine effectiveness and vaccination coverage, the analy-
sis was stratified by age and risk group as follows: children aged
6 months to under 2 years, children aged 2 y to 17 years, adults
aged 18 to 49 y stratified according to low-risk and high-risk
conditions, adults aged 50 to 64 y stratified low-risk and high-
risk conditions, elderly aged 65 and above.
High-risk conditions were the following: persons with pul-
monary and cardiovascular illnesses, metabolic diseases includ-
ing diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, and various types of
immunosuppression
including
acquired
immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS) or induced immunosuppression in trans-
plant recipients.26,40,41
Assessment of the additional outcomes avoided with
the use of QIV instead of TIV
The model used in this study was similar to that used by Reed
et al, 2012, for the US.22 Epidemiological and economic out-
comes were estimated for each season for the actual scenario
where the TIV was used, and for a hypothetical scenario where
QIV would have been used instead. Results are therefore
presented as the additional epidemiological and economic out-
comes avoided with the use of QIV instead of TIV.
Epidemiological outcomes include the numbers of influ-
enza cases, general practitioners (GP) visits, hospitalizations
and deaths, and workdays lost due to influenza. They are
presented as absolute number and per 100,000 inhabitants.
In the results section, to facilitate the reading of the results,
absolute numbers of cases > 1 million, between 100,000
and 999,999, and between 10,000 and 99,999 have been
rounded to the nearest hundred thousands, 10 thousands
and thousands respectively.
Economic outcomes were the associated costs to epidemiologi-
cal and were reported from the third-party payer (TPP) and the
societal perspectives (SP). Costs from the TPP perspective were
estimated by aggregating the costs associated with GP consultations
and hospitalizations. Costs from the SP include costs associated
with GP consultations, hospitalizations and workdays lost.
Data on influenza viruses circulation (Table 5), attack rate
(AR) of the different strains and incidence rates of different
influenza-associated outcomes (GP visits, hospitalization and
death) by country and age group, on vaccination coverage by
country, age and risk group (Table 6), on B strain included in
the vaccine and therefore degree of mismatch (for TIV sce-
nario), and on vaccine effectiveness against the different strains
(Table 7) were incorporated in the analysis. Model description,
epidemiological and economic inputs are presented in Supple-
mentary material.
No mismatch in the QIV scenario was considered and the
vaccine was assumed to be equally effective against both B
strains. As in Reed et al, the observed seasonal vaccine effective-
ness against the included B strain was applied to both B strains
in the QIV vaccine. However, whereas the effectiveness of the
vaccine against the mismatched B strain was assumed to be
zero by Reed et al.,22 a cross protection for the mismatched B
strain similar across age groups was assumed in this study
(Table 7).25,34 In addition, contrary to the analysis by Reed
et al.,22 stratification by age group and high-risk group for com-
plications was done in this study in order to take into account
difference in epidemiology, vaccine effectiveness and vaccine
coverage in these different age groups.

 Additional epidemiological and economic outcomes avoided
were extrapolated proportionally from EU-5 to EU-27 according
to the EU-5 and EU-27 population figures in each age group.
Sensitivity analyses
Sensitivity analyses regarding effectiveness of QIV were con-
ducted. The epidemiological burden averted is presented with an
interval corresponding to a variation of C/¡ 20% of the QIV
effectiveness (Table 3). In addition, deterministic sensitivity anal-
yses were performed to assess the impact of variability in model
data inputs on the model estimates by varying key parameters
within ranges reflecting possible parameter values. Deterministic
sensitivity analysis is represented by tornado charts and con-
cerned the absolute number of influenza cases and average cost
savings per season according to TPP and SP for the 5 EU coun-
tries during the 2002–03 to 2012–13 influenza seasons.
All analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel�.
