IMPORTANCE In approximately 20% of atrial fibrillation (AF)–related ischemic strokes, stroke
is the first clinical manifestation of AF. Strategies are needed to identify and therapeutically
address previously undetected AF.
OBJECTIVE To quantify the incidence of AF in patients at high risk for but without previously
known AF using an insertable cardiac monitor.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective, single-arm, multicenter study was
conducted from November 2012 to January 2017. Visits took place at 57 centers in the United
States and Europe. Patients with a CHADS2 score of 3 or greater (or 2 with at least 1 additional
risk factor) were enrolled. Approximately 90% had nonspecific symptoms potentially
compatible with AF, such as fatigue, dyspnea, and/or palpitations.
EXPOSURES Patients underwent monitoring with an insertable cardiac monitor for 18 to 30
months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was adjudicated AF lasting 6 or more
minutes and was assessed at 18 months. Other analyses included detection rates at points
from 30 days to 30 months and among CHADS2 score subgroups. Median time from insertion
to detection and the percentage of patients subsequently prescribed oral anticoagulation
therapy was also determined.
RESULTS A total of 446 patients were enrolled; 233 (52.2%) were male, and the mean (SD)
age was 71.5 (9.9) years. A total of 385 patients (86.3%) received an insertable cardiac
monitor, met the primary analysis cohort definition, and were observed for a mean (SD)
period of 22.5 (7.7) months. The detection rate of AF lasting 6 or more minutes at 18 months
was 29.3%. Detection rates at 30 days and 6, 12, 24, and 30 months were 6.2%, 20.4%,
27.1%, 33.6%, and 40.0%, respectively. At 18 months, AF incidence was similar among
patients with CHADS2 scores of 2 (24.7%; 95% CI, 17.3-31.4), 3 (32.7%; 95% CI, 23.8-40.7),
and 4 or greater (31.7%; 95% CI, 22.0-40.3) (P = .23). Median (interquartile) time from device
insertion to first AF episode detection was 123 (41-330) days. Of patients meeting the primary
end point, 13 (10.2%) had 1 or more episodes lasting 24 hours or longer, and oral
anticoagulation therapy was prescribed for 72 patients (56.3%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The incidence of previously undiagnosed AF may be
substantial in patients with risk factors for AF and stroke. Atrial fibrillation would have gone
undetected in most patients had monitoring been limited to 30 days. Further trials regarding
the value of detecting subclinical AF and of prophylactic therapies are warranted.

 A
trial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of people
worldwide,1,2 is associated with increased morbidity
and mortality, and increases with older age, hyperten-
sion, diabetes, heart failure, and more.2-4 Importantly, these
same conditions are independently associated with in-
creased stroke risk.5 Atrial fibrillation combined with these co-
morbidities is particularly concerning.
Atrial fibrillation episodes may be symptomatic, asymp-
tomatic (ie, silent AF), or both.2,6,7 Symptoms commonly as-
sociated with AF (all nonspecific) include palpitations, chest
discomfort,dizzinessorsyncope,dyspnea,heartfailure,and/or
fatigue,2,7 but correlation between AF and symptoms is poor.8
Heart failure or stroke can be the first clinical manifestation
of AF.
Other than in patients with cryptogenic stroke or im-
planted pacemakers/defibrillators (the latter having associ-
ated cardiac electrical disorders), silent AF incidence has not
been well defined, to our knowledge. Importantly, in patients
with implanted pacemakers/defibrillators, silent (sometimes
also termed subclinical) AF episodes as brief as 5 minutes to
24 hours have been associated with increased stroke risk9-16
and are more common than symptomatic episodes.15-18 Rec-
ognition of previously undiagnosed AF and initiation of ap-
propriate/indicated therapies, including oral anticoagulation
(OAC) therapy, is essential for stroke prevention.
Minimally invasive prolonged electrocardiographic moni-
toring with insertable cardiac monitors (ICMs) could facili-
tate early AF diagnosis and earlier treatment. However, the di-
agnostic yield in high-risk patients is not well known. The
REVEAL AF study was therefore performed to determine the
incidence of previously undiagnosed AF using ICMs in a high-
risk population.
Methods
Trial Design
The REVEAL AF study is a prospective, single-arm, open-
label, multicenter clinical study designed to establish the in-
cidence of AF using an ICM (Reveal XT or Reveal LINQ;
Medtronic). Detailed methods have been published
previously.19,20
The study was supported by Medtronic and was con-
ducted in compliance with applicable local laws and regula-
tions of each participating country. The study protocol can be
found in Supplement 1. Ethics committee or institutional re-
view board approval was obtained at each institution (eAp-
pendix in Supplement 2). All patients provided written in-
formed consent prior to participation in the study. A steering
committee was responsible for the study design, conduct,
and reporting. Data monitoring, collection, and analysis
were performed by the sponsor and steering committee in
partnership.
Study Participants
Recruitment occurred at 57 clinical centers in the United States
and Europe from November 2012 to June 2015. Patients with
no AF history but deemed to be at risk based on demographic
characteristics with or without symptoms were enrolled. All
patients had either a CHADS2 score of 3 or greater or a score
of 2 with at least 1 of the following AF risk factors: coronary
artery disease, renal impairment, sleep apnea, or chronic ob-
structive pulmonary disease. All patients underwent 24 hours
or more of external monitoring within 90 days prior to enroll-
ment or before ICM insertion. Any AF was exclusionary.
Enrolled patients who received an ICM were observed for
18 or more months, until either their 30-month visit or until
the last patient completed the 18-month visit. Patients had in-
office visits every 6 months (plus unscheduled pro re nata) and
transmitted device data monthly via remote monitoring
(CareLink; Medtronic). The REVEAL AF study used the com-
ponents of the Reveal ICM device. Devices were used in ac-
cordance with approved indications and were not paid for by
the sponsor.
Study Outcomes
The primary outcome was the incidence of adjudicated AF 6
or more minutes in duration at 18 months. Secondary out-
comes included predictors of AF and physician actions in re-
sponse to AF detection. Additional exploratory objectives en-
compassed safety, AF incidence at additional time points, and
comparisonofAFincidenceamongCHADS2subgroupsandpa-
tients with vs without baseline symptoms.
Statistical Analysis
Sample size was chosen to (1) generate a 2-sided 95% CI for the
18-month incidence rate of AF that would be approximately
10 percentage points in width for an estimated event rate of
16% to 20% and (2) adequately power the secondary objec-
tives. Standard statistical methods were used for summariza-
tion and analysis. To ensure a robust data set for subgroup
analysis, a minimum of 70 patients with CHADS2 scores of 2,
3, and 4 or greater were included in each of these subgroups.
Confidence intervals and any statistical significance testing
used an α level of .05, unless otherwise stated. Tests of hy-
potheses were 2-tailed. Only adjudicated episodes, based on
stored electrogram data, were included for analysis of the pri-
mary end point. Patients without an end point during fol-
low-up were censored at the date of last device interrogation.
The date of device implant was time 0 for survival analyses.
A Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify pre-
dictors of AF, while log-rank tests were used to compare AF
Key Points
Question Will insertable cardiac monitors identify a high
incidence of previously undiagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) in
patients at high risk for AF and stroke?
Findings In this study of 446 patients, the rate of AF detection
was 29.3% and 40.0% at 18 and 30 months, respectively, and
often resulted in prescription of oral anticoagulation.
Meaning The incidence of previously undiagnosed AF identified
by insertable cardiac monitors may be substantial in patients at
high risk for AF and stroke.

 incidence among CHADS2 score subgroups and subgroups de-
fined by presence of baseline symptoms, such as palpita-
tions. Atrial fibrillation lasting 6 or more minutes was chosen
as the primary end point because at the time this study was
being designed, current evidence suggested that subclinical
AF lasting 5 to 6 minutes or longer was associated with a sig-
nificantly increased risk of stroke or systemic embolism in pa-
tients with a pacemaker14,15 and because the Reveal ICM has
high sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for
detecting AF episodes of this duration.21
Results
Patient Characteristics
Of 446 patients screened, 394 (88.3%) underwent device in-
sertion. Table 1 and eTable 1 in Supplement 2 summarize the

vice-related serious adverse events were infrequent (total, 13
[3.3%]; Reveal LINQ ICM, 6 [2.2%]; Reveal XT ICM, 7 [5.7%];
P = .12) and have been reported previously.19 There were 385
patients included in the primary end point analysis; of these,
326 (84.7%) reached the target 18-month follow-up (Figure 1).
The mean (SD) age was 71.5 (9.9) years, and 297 (77.1%) were

 (95% CI, 16.2-24.3), 27.1% (95% CI, 22.5-31.5), 33.6% (95% CI,
28.3-38.6), and 40.0% (95% CI, 33.6-45.8), respectively. Two
sensitivity analyses were performed including all patients who
exited the study prematurely; one assumed all patients had AF
while the other assumed none had AF following their date of
exit (the 2 extreme conditions). In the first, the 18-month in-
cidence rate would have been 41.1%; in the second, 28.2%.
Given our observed rate of 29.3%, it is possible the true inci-
dence would have been higher had no patients exited early. Of
the 128 patients with AF lasting 6 or more minutes, 113 (88.3%)
had 30 or more minutes of AF, 97 (75.8%) had 1 or more hours
ofAF,and53(41.4%)had6ormorehoursofAFinadayatsome
point. Thirteen patients (10.2%) had at least 1 episode lasting
24 hours or longer. The time to onset of daily AF burden for
the entire cohort, excluding events adjudicated to not be AF,
is shown in Figure 2B. By 30 months, 35.6% (95% CI, 29.4-
41.3) had at least 1 hour of AF in a day. Overall, the median (in-
terquartile range) time from device insertion to first AF de-
tection was 123 (41-330) days. There was no difference in AF
detection rates between patients with or without any symp-
toms at enrollment.22 However, the AF detection rate at 18
months was higher in patients specifically with palpitations
at baseline vs those without (35.3%; 95% CI, 29.0-42.6 vs
23.0%; 95% CI, 17.5-29.8; P = .02).
Other Outcomes
At 18 months, there was no significant difference in AF inci-
dence between patients with CHADS2 scores of 2 (24.7%; 95%
CI, 17.3-31.4), 3 (32.7%; 95% CI, 23.8- 40.7), or 4 or more (31.7%;
95% CI, 22.0-40.3) (Figure 2C). When individual baseline char-
acteristics were assessed, only age (the strongest) and body
massindexweresignificantindependentpredictorsofAF,with
AF incidence higher in older and more obese patients (Table 2).
Biomarkers (brain natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, tro-
ponin-I, and thyrotropin) were also examined as predictors in
a subset of patients, but the analysis was underpowered. No
circulating biomarkers were predictive of AF when control-
ling for other prespecified clinical characteristics.
Amongpatientswhomettheprimaryoutcomeof6ormore
minutes of AF, 72 (56.3%) were prescribed OAC therapy and
19 (14.8%) were prescribed rhythm control at some point dur-
ing follow-up. Treatment was not required per protocol. Dur-
ing the total 732.8 patient-years of follow-up among patients
in the primary end point analysis, 132 patients (34.1%) expe-
rienced 1 or more health care uses, including 94 hospitaliza-
tions (12 associated with AF); 12 patients (3.1%) developed per-
sistent AF (with 4 undergoing cardioversion).
There were 6 strokes in 6 patients (3 met the primary end
point before the stroke event; 1 met the primary end point after
having a stroke), and 12 transient ischemic attacks in 11 patients
(allnonadjudicated).Theirsignificancecannotbeassessedow-
ing to frequent initiation of OAC therapy on detection of AF.
Discussion
The at-risk population chosen for this study represents a
common group of patients encountered clinically. Stroke is a
high concern in patients with AF and does not require AF to
be symptomatic. Results of the REVEAL AF study demon-
strated a substantial incidence of previously undiagnosed
AF (nearly 30%) at 18 months of follow-up in patients demo-
graphically at high risk of both AF and stroke. By 30 months,
the detection rate increased to 40%. With a median time to

 AF detection of 123 days, most patients would not have been
identified with shorter duration monitoring typical of exter-
nal devices. Age and body mass index were found to be sig-
nificant predictors of AF detection. In separate univariate
assessments, palpitations at baseline were associated with a
higher incidence of AF, but CHADS2 score was not. However,
notably, in most large monitoring databases, palpitations are
not specific for AF and often occur in association with sinus
rhythm. Of patients who met the primary end point, 72
(56%) were prescribed OAC therapy. While the benefit of
OAC in this patient population is unknown, ongoing antico-
agulation trials for subclinical AF will provide insight (ie,
Apixaban for the Reduction of Thromboembolism in
Patients With Device-Detected Subclinical Atrial Fibrillation
[ARTESiA; clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01938248], Non–
Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With
Atrial High Rate Episodes [NOAH; NCT02618577], and Atrial
Fibrillation Detected by Continuous ECG Monitoring [LOOP;
NCT02036450]). Additionally, results from the FIND-AF ran-
domized trial23 suggest OAC therapy is beneficial for detected
subclinical AF in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
Two smaller trials24,25 have also reported on the inci-
dence of AF in high-risk populations using ICMs. The Preva-
lence of Sub-Clinical Atrial Fibrillation Using an Implantable
Cardiac Monitor (ASSERT-II) study (NCT01694394)24 was a
multicenter trial that enrolled 273 at-risk patients without
known AF; 252 (92.3%) received an ICM and completed follow-
up. The incidence rate of AF 5 or more minutes was 34.4% per
person-year. The Predicting Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter
(PREDATE-AF)study(NCT01851902)25wasasingle-centertrial
of patients without known AF but with a CHA2DS2-VASc score
of 2 or greater. In 245 patients, the incidence of AF or atrial
flutter was 22% during an average follow-up of approximately
15 months. The mean time to detection was similar to the
REVEAL AF study at 141 days. There was no difference in the
AFdetectionratesbetweenpatientswithCHA2DS2-VAScscores
of 4 or less vs 5 or greater. Male sex was the only significant
predictor of AF. Oral anticoagulation therapy was initiated in

of 24 hours of external monitoring without AF detected prior
to device insertion. This, in addition to broader inclusion
criteria,mayexplainthelowerAFdetectionrateintheREVEAL
AF study vs the ASSERT-II study.24
Other studies have also reported on the use of external
monitors or smart phones to detect subclinical AF.26-30 How-
ever, the AF incidence reported in such studies is low, as ex-
ternalmonitorshavealimitedsurveillancedurationwithlower
diagnosticyieldthanICMs.Furthermore,externaldevicescan-
not accurately determine AF burden, a parameter which may
be related to the magnitude of stroke risk.31
While the primary end point in the REVEAL AF study was
anAFepisodelasting6ormoreminutes,manypatientshadpro-
longedcumulativeperiodsofAF;theincidenceofAFlasting30
minutes or more in a day was greater than 40% at 30 months,
and the corresponding incidence of AF lasting 6 or more hours
in a day was nearly 20% at 30 months. Additionally, 10.2% of
patients with 6 or more consecutive minutes of AF had at least
1 episode lasting 24 hours or longer. Both the Asymptomatic
Atrial Fibrillation and Stroke Evaluation in Pacemaker Patients
and the Atrial Fibrillation Reduction Atrial Pacing Trial
(ASSERT)32 and the study by Israel et al33 demonstrated that
even prolonged episodes of AF can be asymptomatic.
A recent subanalysis from ASSERT32 suggested that a 24-
hour duration of subclinical AF may be critical for increased
stroke risk. However, the mean CHADS2 score in ASSERT was
only 2.2,32 and other reports suggest that risk is tied to syner-
gism between AF duration and the severity of associated co-
morbidities rather than a specific AF duration.11,34 Impor-
tantly,pathophysiologicalchangesinatrialtissuebecauseofage,
disease, or genetics may promote stasis and/or alter atrial en-
dothelial function with resultant thromboembolic risk. Simi-
lar dysfunction may also be consequent to AF itself and can be
additive to dysfunction produced by underlying comorbidi-
ties. The abnormal atrial milieu that underlies thrombogen-
esis may persist when an episode of AF ends. Thus, the dura-
tion of AF that is critical is likely not a single specific value.
Moreover,the24-hourdurationhasnotbeenconfirmedinother
trials. Accordingly, we cannot yet determine in a given patient
what degree subclinical AF is causative of embolization or
whether it is just a risk marker.
Does the thromboembolic risk associated with relatively
brief durations of AF justify their detection with prolonged
monitoring? In the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation
of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial,35 nonsustained,
asymptomatic episodes of AF carried the same risk for stroke
assymptomaticAF.Datagatheredbydeviceinterrogationfrom
patients with implanted pacemakers and defibrillators sug-
gest that as little as 6 minutes to 6 hours of AF may double in-
cident stroke risk,13-15,36 yet such observations may not be rel-
evantinpatientswithoutelectricaldisordersrequiringacardiac
rhythm management device. It is also unknown whether treat-
ing such brief AF episodes with OAC therapy would signifi-
cantlyreducestrokerisk.Importantly,3trials(ARTESIA,NOAH,
and LOOP) are underway to assess the potential role of OAC
therapy in patients with device-detected AF.
Itisnoteworthythatbasedontheinformationavailablefrom
the ICM, 56% of patients in the REVEAL AF study who met the
primary end point received a new prescription for OACs, as did
76% of patients in the PREDATE AF study.25 Interestingly, this
is lower than rates observed with ICM monitoring in patients
with cryptogenic stroke37 and in response to AF detection
clinically.38 For patients with cryptogenic stroke, the thresh-
oldtotreatislikelylowerowingtopreviousstrokehistory.Cur-
rently, to our knowledge, there are no data to prove the effi-
cacy of OAC therapy in the REVEAL AF population, but this is
currently under investigation in the LOOP trial. Nonetheless,
REVEAL AF results support further studies to assess whether
ICM-based screening for AF may be beneficial and cost-
effective for stroke prevention in specific high-risk popula-
tions and demonstrate that high-risk patients were willing to
undergo ICM monitoring for AF screening
Limitations
Although the REVEAL AF study is, to our knowledge, the larg-
est trial assessing the use of ICMs for AF detection in high-risk
patients, it remains modest in size. Nonetheless, the PREDATE
AF,25 ASSERT-II,24 and REVEAL AF studies are concordant in
finding that previously undetected AF is common in high-risk
patients. Second, we were unable to assess the embolic risk
posed by device-detected AF because of the small number of
strokes during follow-up and potential confounding by antico-
agulation use. Third, the positive predictive value of ICMs for
AF depends on episode duration, device settings, and AF inci-
dence in the population monitored.39 In the REVEAL AF study,
deviceswereprogrammedtofavorsensitivity,asthiswasanex-
ploratorystudyinanewpatientpopulation.Importantly,allepi-
sodes that met the primary end point definition were adjudi-
cated. Fourth, given the size of our study, the low enrollment
rate,andprematuredropouts,itisdifficulttodeterminetheex-
ternal validity of this study cohort to the general population.
However, the relative consistency of findings with the PRE-
DATE AF study,25 ASSERT-II,24 and the pacemaker/ICD popu-
lation suggests that the REVEAL AF cohort likely is represen-
tative of the general population.
Conclusions
Atrialfibrillation6ormoreminutesisfrequentlydetectedwith
ICM monitoring in patients with previously unknown AF but
with demographic factors (with or without symptoms) that
place them at risk of both AF and stroke. As the AF incidence
was still rising at 30 months, the ideal monitoring duration is
unclear. Our findings have important implications for AF
screening and stroke prevention in this population.
