A
cute osteoarticular infection is an important problem in 
the pediatric population, potentially threatening both 
life and limb.1,2 Historically, such infections have largely 
been attributed to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyo-
genes and Haemophilus influenzae type b,3,4 but most series have 
reported a high proportion (23% to 70%) of culture-negative 
infections.4–6 Recent European studies reported substantial pro-
portions of cases with K. kingae infection, ranging from 15% to 
75%.7–9 Although these high proportions may be related to 
increasing prevalence of the pathogen, they are more likely 
related to improvements in detection techniques, including a 
K. kingae–specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay.10,11
Diagnosing K. kingae infections of the bones and joints is diffi-
cult for 2 reasons. First, the clinical presentation is often subtle, 
and the results of paraclinical investigations may remain within 
normal ranges.7,12 Second, K. kingae is a fastidious microorgan-
ism that is difficult to grow on solid media,13 which may explain 
the high proportion of negative culture results for joint aspirates 
from children with symptoms highly suggestive of infection. 
The pathogenesis of osteoarticular infection related to 
K. kingae remains unclear, but there is evidence that the bacter-
ium initially colonizes the oropharynx before penetrating the 
bloodstream and invading distant organs.14 Recent studies from 
Europe and Israel have suggested a strong association between 
oropharyngeal carriage of K. kingae and the risk of osteoarticular 
infection in young children.14–16 However, this relation has never 
been shown in North America.
In this multicentre study, we sought to evaluate the associa-
tion between osteoarticular infection and detection of oro-
pharyngeal K. kingae by PCR in young children.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Kingella kingae has been 
increasingly identified in patients with 
osteoarticular infections. Our main 
objective was to evaluate the association 
between carriage of K. kingae in the oro-
pharynx of preschool children and osteo-
articular infections.
METHODS: We conducted this prospec-
tive case–control study in 2 tertiary care 
pediatric hospitals (Canada and Switzer-
land) between 2014 and 2016. Potential 
cases were children aged 6 to 48 months 
with a presumptive diagnosis of osteoar-
ticular infection according to the treating 
emergency physician. Confirmed cases 
were those with diagnosis of osteomyel-
itis or septic arthritis proven by positive 
findings on technetium-labelled bone 
scan or magnetic resonance imaging or 
identification of a microorganism in joint 
aspirate or blood. For each case, we 
recruited 4 age-matched controls from 
among children presenting to the same 
emergency department for trauma. The 
independent variable was presence of 
oropharyngeal K. kingae DNA identified 
by a specific polymerase chain reac-
tion assay. We determined the associa-
tion between oropharyngeal carriage 
of K. kingae and definitive osteoarticu-
lar infection. 
RESULTS: The parents of 77 children 
admitted for suspected osteoarticular 
infection and 286 controls were invited 
to participate and provided informed 
consent. We identified K. kingae in the 
oropharynx of 46 (71%) of 65 con-
firmed cases and 17 (6%) of 286 con-
trols; these results yielded an odds 
ratio of 38.3 (95% confidence interval 
18.5–79.1).
INTERPRETATION: Detection of oro-
pharyngeal K. kingae was strongly 
associated with osteoarticular infec-
tion among children presenting with 
symptoms suggestive of such infection.

Methods
Study design
This prospective, multicentre case–control study involved a con-
venience sample of children visiting 2 tertiary care pediatric hospi-
tals. We recruited participants at the emergency departments of 
Geneva University Hospitals (Geneva, Switzerland) and the Centre 
hospitalier universitaire Sainte-Justine (Montréal) between August 
2014 and June 2016. Both sites are university-affiliated hospitals, and 
the annual emergency department census is about 30 000 and 
80 000, respectively. We chose these sites because 1 member of the 
study team (S.M.) has worked at both locations, both sites have good 
clinical research infrastructure, and there was previous collaboration 
on another study.17
Study population
We recruited 2 populations of participants, aged 6 to 48 months: cases 
and controls. Potential cases were children with clinical suspicion of 
osteoarticular infection, according to the treating physician. These 
children presented to the emergency department for joint pain, limp 
or decreased limb movement without trauma, with or without fever. 
After identifying a potential case, the treating physician contacted a 
research assistant, who invited the family to participate in the study. 
To identify definitive cases, 2 of the investigators (J.G., C.R.) 
reviewed the medical charts of all recruited potential cases at the 
end of the study. They were blinded to the oropharyngeal swab 
results and to each other’s reviews assessing the probability of 
osteoarticular infection. The assessors classified each of these cases 
as impossible, possible, highly probable or confirmed. Children with 
a classification of “impossible” had another confirmed diagnosis 
(e.g., leukemia or fracture). Those with a classification of “possible” 
had abnormal findings on analysis of joint aspirate, but no growth of 
microorganisms. Those with a classification of “highly probable” 
had positive findings on technetium-labelled bone scanning or 
magnetic resonance imaging, but no growth of microorganisms. 
Children with a classification of “confirmed” had suspicious imaging 
findings and identification of a microorganism in the joint aspirate 
or blood. For purposes of the analysis, children with classification of 
“highly prob 
able” or “confirmed” were considered to represent 
definitive cases. 
The control group consisted of a convenience sample of chil-
dren visiting the same emergency departments for benign 
trauma, matched for age (within 3 mo). The charts for all of these 
children were reviewed to ensure that osteoarticular infection 
did not develop during the week following recruitment.
Exposure
The primary independent variable of interest was the presence of 
K. kingae, as detected by PCR from an oropharyngeal swab sam-
ple, as described below. 
All participants underwent clinical and paraclinical evalua-
tions at the discretion of the treating physician. In all cases, these 
evaluations included blood sampling (for complete blood count, 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and culture) 
and various imaging investigations, depending on the clinical 
presentation and the treating phys 
ician. 
After a parent provided written informed consent, an oro-
pharyngeal sample was obtained using a dry swab (ESwab Liquid 
Amies nylon flocked applicator, Copan Diagnostics) for PCR iden-
tification of K. kingae. For patients with suspected septic arthritis, 
a joint aspirate was obtained for analysis and culture, including 
Gram staining and PCR assay specific to K. kingae. Aerobic blood 
culture and synovial fluid culture (using blood bottles and plates) 
were performed according to standard protocols to identify the 
most common aerobic bacteria. For a few patients with suspected 
bone infection, a bone aspirate was obtained for analysis and cul-
ture, including Gram staining and PCR testing for K. kingae.
All oropharyngeal samples from the Montréal site were kept 
frozen at –20°C until batch shipment of 25 samples to the central lab-
oratory in Geneva, Switzerland. Samples from Geneva were analyzed 
in the 24–48 hours after recruitment. The oropharyngeal samples 
were analyzed with a real-time PCR assay designed to detect 2 gene 
targets from the K. kingae RTX toxin locus, rtxA and rtxB.18 To evalu-
ate the analytical sensitivity of these assays, we used a range of seri-
ally diluted K. kingae genomic DNA. The assay exhibited a sensitivity 
of 30 colony-forming units, which is 10 times more sensitive than a 
previously published semi-nested, broad-range assay for the 16S 
rRNA gene, as described previously.18 DNA was extracted with a 
MagNAPure LC instrument using the MagNAPure LC DNA isolation 
kit II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufactur-
er’s instructions. TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix reagent with 
AmpErase UNG (uracil N-glycosylase; Applied Biosystems) was used, 
with 5 µL of input DNA and nuclease-free water (Promega). Each PCR 
analysis was performed in duplicate, with blinding as to the type of 
participant (case or control). A PCR-positive sample collected from a 
culture-proven K. kingae sample was used as a positive control.
For each participant, a standardized chart review form was com-
pleted by a research assistant, with baseline demographic character-
istics, information about the disease and results of paraclinical inves-
tigations. For all participants, the treating phys 
icians and research 
personnel were blinded to the results of oropharyngeal swab testing.
Statistical analysis
Baseline demographic characteristics and types of infection were 
described for both the hospitals and the types of participants. 
The primary analysis included definitive cases and controls, to 
measure the association between oropharyngeal carriage of 
K.  kingae and osteoarticular infection. We constructed a 2 × 2 
table showing the numbers of positive oropharyngeal samples 
for cases and controls and then calculated odds ratios (ORs). We 
calculated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all measurements.
Previous studies suggested that the prevalence of K. kingae was 
as high as 75% among young children with osteoarticular infection15 
and was 5% to 10% among controls.13,19,20 We estimated that recruit-
ment of 32 cases would yield 90% power to identify a difference of 
25% in the prevalence of K. kingae between the 2 groups, with an 
α value of 0.05. Therefore, we recruited 4 controls for each case. 
Ethics approval
The study was approved by the research ethics boards of the Cen-
tre hospitalier universitaire Sainte-Justine and the Geneva Univer-
sity Hospitals. For inclusion in the study, each child’s legal guard-

ian had to provide written informed consent. Assent from the 
children was deemed unnecessary because of their young age.
Results
From August 2014 to June 2016, the parents of 77 children admitted 
for suspected osteoarticular infection and of 286 controls were invited 
to participate and provided written informed consent to be included 
in the study (Figure 1). Of the 77 potential cases, 69 had a definitive 
diagnosis of osteoarticular infection, according to the 2 chart review-
ers (100% agreement between reviewers). Four cases were excluded 
because no oropharyngeal sample was obtained. As a result, 65 defin-
itive cases and 286 controls were included in the final analysis. 
Table 1 describes the baseline demographic characteristics of the 
study participants. The 2 sites recruited similar numbers of partici-
pants. Median age and sex were similar for the cases from the 2 hos-
pitals and the control group. Blood culture results were available for 
62 (95%) of the participants with confirmed osteoarticular infection. 
In 34 cases, K. kingae infection was identified in the joint or bone 
aspirate (4 by culture and 30 by PCR), and in 8 cases, another micro-
organism was identified in the blood (n = 2), in a joint (n = 5) or both 
(n = 1). After K. kingae, the most common bacterial species was 
S. aureus (4 cases); 2 cases had S. pyogenes, 1 case had Salmonella

typhi, and 1 case had Escherichia coli. The proportion of cases with 
K. kingae infection was similar at the 2 sites: 17 (49%) of 35 cases in 
Geneva and 17 (57%) of 30 cases in Montréal. The proportion of 
cases with another bacterium was also similar for both sites (5 [14%] 
in Geneva and 3 [10%] in Montréal). In the remaining 23 cases, no 
bacteria were identified in blood, bone or joint, including the 13 
cases for which no culture of joint or bone aspirate was performed; 
of these 23 cases, oropharyngeal K. kingae was identified in 14. 
The PCR assays detected K. kingae in the oropharyngeal sam-
ples of 46 of the 65 cases (71%, 95% CI 59%–80%) (Table 2). This 
proportion increased to 31 of the 34 cases with proven osteoarticu-
lar infection caused by K. kingae (91%, 95% CI 77%–97%). Among 
the 8 patients with growth of another bacterial species, oropharyn-
geal K. kingae was identified in only 1 patient. Kingella kingae was 
identified in 17 of the 286 controls (6%, 95% CI 4%–9%). The OR for 
the association between oropharyngeal carriage of K. kingae and 
the risk of osteoarticular infection was 38.3 (95% CI 18.5–79.1).
The presence of oropharyngeal K. kingae was strongly associ-
ated with proven osteoarticular infection by K. kingae (OR 158, 95% 
CI 44–568). A subanalysis identified a higher prevalence of oro-
pharyngeal carriage of K. kingae among the controls at the Geneva 
site (14/151 [9%]) than among controls at the Montréal site (3/135 
[2%]), a difference of 7 percentage points (95% CI 1.5–13 percentage 
points). However, this difference had no effect on the association 
between oropharyngeal carriage of K. kingae and risk of osteoarticu-
lar infection at each site: for Geneva, OR 33 (95% CI 12–86), and for 
Montréal, OR 76 (95% CI 19–297). Finally, 31 of the 34 cases with 
K. kingae infection involved children younger than 23 months.
Interpretation
Using a highly sensitive PCR-based assay designed to detect 
2 gene targets from K. kingae DNA, the current study showed that 
oropharyngeal carriage of this bacterial species was strongly 
associated with osteoarticular infection among young children 
presenting with symptoms suggestive of this diagnosis. 
The association between oropharyngeal carriage of K. kingae and 
osteoarticular infection was first reported in a case series document-
ing 3 children with invasive K. kingae infection in Israel, published in 
2009.14 A subsequent prospective study, published in 2013, found 
that K. kingae was the causative agent for osteoarticular infection in 
75% of 40 Swiss children aged 6 to 48 months.15 More important, the 
oropharyngeal swabs from all 30 of the K. kingae cases yielded posi-
tive results. Finally, a French study published in 2012 similarly 
reported positive throat culture results for K. kingae for 8 of 12 chil-
dren with confirmed K. kingae joint infection.16
Although determining the frequency of pathogens was not an 
objective of this study, the most common pathogen responsible for 
osteoarticular infection among young children in our study was K. 
kingae. It was present in 17 of the 30 cases in Montréal, while another 
pathogen was identified in only 3 other cases. Overall, K. kingae rep-
resented 85% of the Montréal cases in which bacteria were identified. 
Previous studies conducted in North America21–23 have suggested a 
lower prevalence of K. kingae, leading to the belief that K. kingae is a 
European problem that is not present in North America. 
Recent review articles have generally suggested S. aureus as the 
most common pathogen for osteoarticular infection.1,24 Studies con-
ducted in California,21 Tennessee22 and Texas23 have reported 
S. aureus as the most common pathogen of osteoarticular infection 
in children, with proportions ranging from 40% to 85%. However, in 
contrast to those earlier studies, we used a highly sensitive technique 
to identify K. kingae in the joint aspirate samples. In addition, we pri-
marily identified K. kingae in children younger than 23 months. It is 
possible that the younger age of our study population accounts for 
the difference in reported pathogens, relative to earlier studies.
The strong association between oropharyngeal carriage of 
K. kingae and osteoarticular infection has several clinical implications. 
First, given the important OR value, detection of K. kingae in the oro-
pharynx might be useful to confirm a potential diagnosis of osteoar-
ticular infection. Second, oropharyngeal swabbing could be useful to 
suggest the pathogen in many young children with suspected bone 
infections, from whom bone aspirate is more complicated to obtain 
and for whom blood culture frequently yields negative results.23 In this 
clinical situation, detection of oropharyngeal K. kingae could help to 
establish the presumptive causative microorganism. This approach 
was suggested in a recent study reporting K. kingae infection in 
10 children with culture-negative spondylodiskitis.25 However, this 
possibility must be considered with caution because our study 
reported oropharyngeal K. kingae in 1 of 8 children with osteoarticular 
infection and presence of another bacterial species. Identification of 
oropharyngeal K. kingae may help to guide antibiotic treatment, given 
that resistance to β-lactams and high-level resistance to clindamycin 
have been reported for K. kingae. In the current study, 14 of the 23 
cases in which no pathogen was identified by culture had oropharyn-

geal K. kingae identified by PCR. It could be inferred that this was the 
pathogen causing the osteoarticular infection. PCR-based assays 
could also reduce the time for bacterial identification from days to 
hours, relative to current culture standards.26
Limitations
This study had limitations, many inherent to the case–control 
design. We attempted to mitigate selection bias by conducting case 
determination and identifying oropharyngeal K. kingae in a blinded 
fashion. Also, all potential cases were reviewed by 2 co-investigators, 
who were blinded to the oropharyngeal results in determining the 
diagnosis. Despite involvement of 2 centres, the sample size was 
small. Although the magnitude of the association between oro-
pharyngeal carriage of K. kingae and osteoarticular infection was 
large, the prevalence of oropharyngeal carriage should be validated 
in multiple North American cities. Finally, the delay and conditions 
of transport from Canada to Switzerland for the oropharyngeal 
swabs may have reduced the ability of swab testing to identify K. 
kingae. However, the observed association was similar at the 2 sites.
Conclusion
This study showed a strong association between oropharyngeal 
K. kingae detected by PCR and osteoarticular infection among pre-
school children presenting with symptoms suggestive of this diag-
nosis. In light of these results, investigation for oropharyngeal 
K. kingae by a PCR assay should be considered for children with clin-
ical suspicion of osteoarticular infection. Identification of the patho-
gen in the oropharynx should orient the presumptive diagnosis 
toward this pathogen. The prevalence and natural evolution of oro-
pharyngeal carriage of K. kingae among healthy children should be 
evaluated by means of multicentre studies.
