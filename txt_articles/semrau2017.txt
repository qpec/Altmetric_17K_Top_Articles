BACKGROUND
The prevalence of facility-based childbirth in low-resource settings has increased dra-
matically during the past two decades, yet gaps in the quality of care persist and mortal-
ity remains high. The World Health Organization (WHO) Safe Childbirth Checklist, a 
quality-improvement tool, promotes systematic adherence to practices that have been 
associated with improved childbirth outcomes.
METHODS
We conducted a matched-pair, cluster-randomized, controlled trial in 60 pairs of facilities 
across 24 districts of Uttar Pradesh, India, testing the effect of the BetterBirth program, an 
8-month coaching-based implementation of the Safe Childbirth Checklist, on a composite 
outcome of perinatal death, maternal death, or maternal severe complications within 7 days 
after delivery. Outcomes — assessed 8 to 42 days after delivery — were compared between 
the intervention group and the control group with adjustment for clustering and matching. 
We also compared birth attendants’ adherence to 18 essential birth practices in 15 matched 
pairs of facilities at 2 and 12 months after the initiation of the intervention.
RESULTS
Of 161,107 eligible women, we enrolled 157,689 (97.9%) and determined 7-day outcomes 
for 157,145 (99.7%) mother–newborn dyads. Among 4888 observed births, birth atten-
dants’ mean practice adherence was significantly higher in the intervention group than 
in the control group (72.8% vs. 41.7% at 2 months; 61.7% vs. 43.9% at 12 months; P<0.001 
for both comparisons). However, there was no significant difference between the trial 
groups either in the composite primary outcome (15.1% in the intervention group and 
15.3% in the control group; relative risk, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.18; 
P 
= 
0.90) or in secondary maternal or perinatal adverse outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS
Birth attendants’ adherence to essential birth practices was higher in facilities that used 
the coaching-based WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist program than in those that did not, 
but maternal and perinatal mortality and maternal morbidity did not differ significantly 
between the two groups. (Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Clinical 
Trials number, NCT02148952.)

lobally, 
maternal 
mortality 
ranges from 3 to 1360 per 100,000 
births, neonatal mortality from 0.95 to 
40.6 per 1000 live births, and the rate of still-
births from 1.2 to 56.3 per 1000 births, with 
low-income and middle-income countries hav-
ing rates an order of magnitude higher than 
those in high-income regions.1,2 Although there 
have been reductions in mortality in recent 
decades, there is substantial room for improve-
ment.1,3-5 Despite a dramatic shift from home 
to facility-based births, birth attendants often 
do not adhere to practices known to reduce 
mortality, and mortality has not decreased as 
expected.6
Research has shown that programs with the 
sole purpose of strengthening birth attendants’ 
training or improving supply availability are in-
sufficient to meaningfully improve patient care 
or outcomes.7 Conversely, interventions incorpo-
rating job aids, such as checklists or case sheets, 
and direct, in-person support have proved effec-
tive in improving clinical practices8,9 as well as 
outcomes.10-12 To bridge the gap between evidence 
and practice, the World Health Organization 
(WHO) created the Safe Childbirth Checklist, a 
practical tool to assist birth attendants in plan-
ning for and performing a more complete 
bundle of 28 essential birth practices.13,14 These 
practices are related to the most common 
causes of avoidable death for women and new-
borns.15
Studies have previously shown that, when well 
implemented at a small scale, the WHO Safe 
Childbirth Checklist improves facility-based birth 
attendants’ adherence to evidence-based care.16-18 
We performed a large cluster-randomized trial of 
coaching-based implementation of the checklist 
(the BetterBirth program) in Uttar Pradesh, India.19 
We intended our intervention to support provid-
ers at multiple levels of the health system in using 
the checklist appropriately, to identify gaps in the 
quality of care at facilities, and to activate re-
sources (e.g., skills training and supply provision) 
within the existing health care system to address 
these gaps. We hypothesized that this interven-
tion, implemented at the facility (cluster) level, 
would result in a reduction in a composite out-
come of stillbirth, early neonatal death, maternal 
death, or maternal severe complications during 
days 0 to 7.
Methods
Trial Design
We conducted a matched-pair, cluster-random-
ized, controlled trial in government health fa-
cilities that received either the BetterBirth pro-
gram, a coaching-based implementation of the 
WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist (60 facilities), or 
the existing standard of care (60 facilities). We 
have described the methods of the BetterBirth 
Trial,19 the BetterBirth intervention,20,21 and our 
data quality-assurance system22 elsewhere. The 
trial protocol and statistical analysis plan are 
available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org. The trial sponsor (the Bill and Me-
linda Gates Foundation) reviewed the trial de-
sign and sample-size calculations but was not 
involved in data collection, management, analy-
sis, or interpretation; the writing of the manu-
script; or the decision to submit the manuscript 
for publication.
Trial Setting and Participants
The most populous state in India (population of 
204 million, 77% rural),23 Uttar Pradesh is a 
high-priority region for national and interna-
tional public health organizations owing to its 
persistently high neonatal mortality (32 per 
1000 live births) and maternal mortality (258 per 
100,000 births).24,25 The government of Uttar 
Pradesh permitted the trial to proceed in 38 
districts, in which we identified 320 eligible fa-
cilities. We considered a facility to be eligible if 
it was designated as a primary health center, 
community health center, or first referral unit; 
had at least 1000 deliveries annually; had at least 
three birth attendants with training of at least 
the level of an auxiliary nurse midwife; had no 
other concurrent quality-improvement or re-
search programs; and had district and facility 
leadership willing to participate. The final trial 
sample included 120 facilities across 24 districts 
(see the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org).
We matched facilities (i.e., clusters) on the 
basis of the following criteria before randomiza-
tion: geographic zone, functional classification 
(primary health center, community health cen-
ter, or first referral unit), distance to a district 
hospital, annual birth volume, and number of 
birth attendants. We randomly assigned facili-

ties to trial groups within each matched pair. 
After matching and randomization, we collected 
baseline data on practice adherence in 10 sites to 
confirm successful matching.
Women who were registered for labor and 
delivery — excluding women who delivered out-
side the facility, women who were referred from 
another facility, or women who were admitted 
for abortion — were eligible for the trial. At each 
intervention facility and its matched control site, 
we began enrolling patients 2 months after the 
initiation of the intervention. Enrollment contin-
ued until the target sample size of the site was 
reached or until 24 weeks after the completion 
of the intervention, whichever occurred first, 
with a 12-week minimum follow-up.
Intervention
We implemented the BetterBirth program in ac-
cordance with the Engage–Launch–Support model 
(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix) that 
was piloted at nontrial sites in Karnataka and 
Uttar Pradesh, India.18,21,26 Coaches (nurses) and 
coach team leaders (physicians or public health 
professionals), all of whom were unaffiliated with 
the facilities and comprehensively trained to ap-
ply a standard behavior-change framework, con-
ducted site visits during the 8-month Support 
phase.20,21 We expected coaches to conduct 43 
daylong visits to each facility, beginning twice 
weekly and tapering to monthly visits. Coach 
team leaders accompanied coaches on alternat-
ing visits (23 total visits). Each facility chose at 
least one staff member to serve as a childbirth 
quality coordinator, a local champion for use of 
the checklist and continued coaching.
Coaches motivated birth attendants to use the 
checklist and to identify, understand, and resolve 
barriers to providing quality care.20,21 Coach team 
leaders supported facility leadership in fostering 
team communication and addressing gaps in care 
at facility and district levels by accessing resourc-
es through the established health care system. 
Cloud-based data collection enabled rapid feed-
back on the progress of a facility. We provided no 
clinical-skills training, financial support, or clin-
ical supplies (except paper copies of the checklist).
Data Collection and Outcomes
The primary outcome was a composite outcome 
of events occurring within the first 7 days after 
delivery, incorporating stillbirth; early neonatal 
death; maternal death; or self-reported maternal 
severe complications, including seizures, loss of 
consciousness for more than 1 hour, fever with 
foul-smelling vaginal discharge, hemorrhage, or 
stroke. We selected measures of complications on 
the basis of definitions from the WHO guidance 
on maternal severe complications, using questions 
that had previously been validated for the report-
ing of complications by patients.27-30 We calculat-
ed a prespecified, additional composite outcome 
consisting of maternal and perinatal death only.
Secondary maternal outcomes by 7 days after 
delivery included maternal death, maternal com-
plications, interfacility transfer (referral), cesare-
an section, hysterectomy, blood transfusion, and 
return to the facility for a health problem. Second-
ary newborn outcomes included stillbirth, early 
neonatal death, and interfacility transfer. We as-
sessed all outcomes from facility register infor-
mation and by contacting women or close family 
members by telephone between 8 and 22 days 
after delivery. If we received no response by 22 
days after delivery, a field worker conducted a 
home visit and attempted to follow up until 42 
days after delivery.
In addition, we selected a convenience sample 
of 15 matched pairs of facilities in which trained 
nurse–data collectors directly observed birth at-
tendants providing care during a 12-hour (day-
time) shift at 2 months after the initiation of the 
intervention (during the highest intensity of coach-
ing) and 12 months after the initiation of the 
intervention (4 months after the cessation of 
coaching). These independent observers measured 
practice adherence, including supply availability 
(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Inter-
vention staff and independent observers were 
not present at the same facility simultaneously.
Owing to the nature of the intervention, we 
were unable to prevent any facility staff, most trial 
staff, or any investigators from being aware of the 
identity of intervention and control facilities. Call-
center staff, who collected the majority of out-
come data, were unaware of facility assignments.
Ethics Compliance
The leadership at each facility provided facility-
level consent for participation and permission for 
trial staff to collect deidentified data on every 
eligible woman from facility registers. Before

patient discharge, we obtained verbal informed 
consent and contact information from each 
woman or her surrogate for follow-up. Data col-
lectors reconfirmed verbal consent at the start 
of the follow-up call or visit. In directly observed 
births, women or their surrogates provided writ-
ten consent for observation.
At trial initiation, birth attendants and facil-
ity staff verbally agreed to participate. Before an 
independent observer collected data, the birth 
attendant verbally reconfirmed agreement. Elec-
tronic data were deidentified and stored in a 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act–compliant database to ensure participant 
privacy.
The trial protocol was approved by ethics re-
view boards at Community Empowerment Lab, 
Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, the Harvard 
T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Population 
Services International, the WHO, and the Indian 
Council of Medical Research. The protocol was 
reviewed and reapproved on an annual basis. 
A data and safety monitoring board met every 
6 months after the initiation of enrollment; one 
interim analysis was conducted when 30% of the 
data were collected (see the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Sample Size
We hypothesized a priori that the rate of the 
primary composite outcome would be 15% lower 
in the intervention group than in the control 
group. We estimated the intracluster (within-
facility) correlation to be 0.01 and the matching 
effect to reduce the standard error by 45%, basing 
these parameters on previous studies.31 We aimed 
to enroll 171,964 women (85,982 per group) to 
detect a 15% relative difference (60 events per 
1000 births in the control group vs. 51 events 
per 1000 births in the intervention group) with 
80% power and an alpha level of 0.05. On the 
basis of limited data available from Uttar 
Pradesh, the baseline rate of the primary com-
posite outcome may have been as high as 120 
events per 1000 births. The baseline rate that 
was used in calculations was purposively set 
lower than the estimated rate owing to limited 
information as well as the inclusion of home-
based birth events in the available data, which 
may have elevated mortality.
In assessing practice adherence, we assumed 
an intracluster (within-facility) correlation of 
0.01 and a design effect of matching of 0.75. 
With 15 matched pairs, we had more than 80% 
power at an alpha level of 0.05 to detect an ab-
solute difference of 8.5 percentage points in the 
rate of any birth practice between the trial 
groups.
Statistical Analysis
Using an intention-to-treat approach, we com-
pared outcomes between trial groups using a 
Rao–Scott chi-square test, accounting for the 
matched-pair, cluster design.32 The main outcome 
was the dichotomous composite outcome that 
was present if any of the three main outcomes 
occurred (maternal death, stillbirth or early neo-
natal death, or maternal severe complications). 
This variable was then used to estimate a com-
posite relative risk.33,34 An additional secondary 
composite outcome included maternal or peri-
natal death only. In secondary analyses, each of 
the main outcomes was compared across groups; 
a Rao–Scott test with 3 degrees of freedom was 
used to assess the overall causal effect. No ad-
justment for multiplicity of testing was made.
For the subgroup of directly observed births, 
we calculated adherence frequencies for each 
prespecified measured practice at 2 months and 
12 months after the initiation of the interven-
tion. Furthermore, we calculated an aggregate 
adherence score by summing the total number of 
18 checklist practices that should be performed 
regardless of the health status of the mother–
newborn dyad (see the Supplementary Appendix). 
We generated the mean number of practices 
(presented as a fraction of 18) performed in each 
trial group and compared the differences at each 
time point, using a Rao–Scott chi-square test.32 
For comparison of individual practices, we used a 
bias-corrected logistic-regression approach that 
can handle zero cells and complete separation of 
points within strata and clusters.35 We conduct-
ed all statistical analyses using SAS software, 
version 9.4 (SAS Institute).

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
plemented in all 60 intervention facilities, with 
high fidelity to the expected number of coaching 
visits (average, 42.1 visits of 43 expected), inter-
actions with facility leadership (average, 14.8 
interactions of 11 expected), and facility data-
sharing meetings (average, 8.6 meetings of 11 
expected).
Adherence to Birth Practices
After 2 months of twice-weekly coaching, birth 
attendants in intervention facilities (1259 obser-
vations) performed, on average, 72.8% of the 18 
measured practices, whereas birth attendants in 
control facilities (1304 observations) performed 
41.7% of the practices (P<0.001) (Table 2). Birth 
attendants performed the majority of specific 
practices, such as blood-pressure and tempera-
ture assessment, proper hand hygiene, and early 
newborn care, at significantly higher rates in the 
intervention group than in the control group. 
Supply availability was similar in the two trial 
groups. In intervention sites, the checklist was 
used at admission in 56.8% of observed births 
and within the first hour after delivery in 74.3% 
of observed births.
Although adherence in intervention facilities 
remained significantly higher than in control 
facilities throughout the trial, adherence in the 
intervention group had decreased to 61.7% of 
practices per childbirth at 12 months, or 4 months 
after coaching ceased. For example, administra-
tion of oxytocin soon after delivery decreased by 
nearly one third (from 79.5% to 53.9%) between 
2 and 12 months. Similarly, checklist use had 
declined in intervention sites at 12 months to 
17.4% of cases at admission and 35.1% within 
1 hour after delivery. In control sites, birth atten-
dants’ average adherence to the 18 measured 
practices remained low at both 2 and 12 months 
(41.7% and 43.9%, respectively).
Mortality and Morbidity
We found no significant difference between in-
tervention and control facilities in our primary 
outcome (15.1% in the intervention group and 
15.3% in the control group; relative risk, 0.99; 
95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.18; P 
= 
0.90) 
or in any secondary outcomes (Table 3). Event 
rates varied widely across facilities, by as much 
as a factor of 10 (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). We found no significant differences 
between the trial groups in the rates of follow-
up care required for women or newborns, hyster-
ectomy, blood transfusion, or interfacility trans-
fer (referral) for women or newborns. In stratified 
analyses, we observed no significant differences 
between the groups according to the phase of 
the intervention (intensive coaching, tapered 
coaching, and 4 months after the intervention), 
time of delivery, or in-facility mortality (data not 
shown).
Discussion
Previous studies have suggested that implemen-
tation of the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist and 
similarly constructed tools can improve quality 
of care, but these studies have lacked rigorous 
data evaluating both adherence to essential birth 
practices and morbidity and mortality.8,9,16-18 In 
this large matched-pair, cluster-randomized, con-
trolled trial in Uttar Pradesh, India, we found 
that the BetterBirth program — a coaching-
based implementation of the WHO Safe Child-
birth Checklist — had no significant effect on 
our primary composite outcome with respect to 
maternal and perinatal health (nor on any sec-
ondary health outcomes), despite significantly 
higher rates of birth attendants’ adherence to 
essential practices in intervention facilities than 
in control facilities.
The majority of maternal and neonatal deaths 
occur around the time of birth and within the 
first 7 days after delivery3,36; thus, interventions 
to improve early outcomes are desperately needed. 
The theory of change in the BetterBirth program 
— that improving the quality of childbirth-related 
care provided in facilities would translate into 
improved patient outcomes — reflects basic as-
sumptions underlying current childbirth work in 
global health. We found that the largely rural 
population living in this resource-limited setting 
had a perinatal mortality (47 per 1000) and a 
maternal morbidity (11.6%) that were much 
higher than anticipated, and there was wide 
variation of event rates across facilities.25 Quality 
of care in control sites, as measured through 
birth attendants’ adherence to practices, was far 
lower than previously recognized.16,25,37-41 Over-
all, birth attendants in nonintervention facilities 
performed approximately 40% of measured es-
sential practices in a typical birth, such as appro-
priate hand hygiene (used in <1% of deliveries) 
or administration of oxytocin within the first

WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program in India
minute after delivery to reduce hemorrhage (used 
in <25%).
We found that a coaching-based implementa-
tion of the checklist could produce broad-based 
improvement in the quality of care of facility-
based childbirth, a necessary step in effecting 
improvement in health outcomes. In intervention 
facilities, birth attendants substantially increased 
their performance of measured practices. At 
2 months, rates of performing recommended 
practices were significantly higher in interven-
tion sites than in control sites, where some 
practices were rarely performed. During the 
coaching intervention, staff at intervention fa-
cilities also had correspondingly higher rates of 
checklist use. However, overall levels of adher-
ence and checklist use diminished after coach-
ing ceased, and the rates of some practices 
never differed significantly between the inter-
vention and control groups. It is possible that 
checklist use was not sustained owing to lack of 
checklist stock, staff belief that they knew the 
items on the checklist, lack of enthusiasm, or 
other reasons. We did not collect specific data 
on reasons for unsustained checklist use. The lack 
of effect on health outcomes despite improve-
ments in performance of recommended practic-
es challenges assumptions that better practice 
adherence would directly result in decreased 
mortality.
One potential interpretation of our findings 
is that increasing adherence to these practices is 
not a worthwhile goal, because these practices 
did not lead to improved outcomes. We strongly 
believe this conclusion to be false. Each of the 
practices incorporated in the checklist (and there-
fore in the BetterBirth program) has its own 
evidence base, including effectiveness with regard 
to improving maternal outcomes, improving neo-
natal outcomes, or both.13,15 Evidence of the 
benefits of proper hand hygiene for laboring 
women and their children, for example, dates 
back to the 1800s.42
Several other factors may have affected the 
results of the trial. Levels of adherence to es-
sential birth practices in the intervention sites 
may have been insufficient to affect outcomes: 
birth attendants performed appropriate hand 
hygiene in only 35% of cases, and although 79% 
of mother–infant pairs initiated skin-to-skin 
warming, only 19% of mother–infant pairs 
maintained that contact for 1 hour. The rate of

use of magnesium sulfate was no higher in the 
intervention facilities than in the control facili-
ties. Persistent gaps in technical skills, manage-
ment of complications, the quality and quantity 
of supplies and medicines, access to supportive 
management, and systems-level accountability 
— mostly unmeasured — could also have had 
a substantial effect on the ability to improve 
health outcomes. Factors that were not targeted 
by the BetterBirth program may have also limited 
its effects, including women’s underlying health 
and nutrition status, the quality of prenatal and 
postnatal care, and the quality of referral care 
for those with more complex needs.
Despite the careful design of the trial, limita-
tions remain. Data on observed adherence to 
practices were available for only a select sub-
sample — 4888 of the 157,689 deliveries at 30 of 
the 120 facilities. For practical reasons, these 
observations were performed at nonrandomly 
selected sites and during daytime hours, which 
potentially limits generalizability to the unob-
served births. The measured levels of adherence 
may have been misleading, if staff practiced

WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program in India
much differently when unobserved.43 In addition, 
although measures of maternal complications 
reported by the patient had previously been vali-
dated by other studies,27-30 misreporting is pos-
sible, because we did not verify reported com-
plications with medical records or physical 
examination. Some trial staff were aware of the 
facility assignments; however, the staff members 
collecting the majority of outcome data were 
unaware of the facility assignments. Further-
more, 7-day outcome information was collected 
between 8 and 42 days after delivery. Thus, recall 
bias may have affected the reporting of maternal 
morbidity but is not likely to have affected the 
reporting of mortality. Whereas the target sam-
ple size was 171,964, the final sample size was 
157,689 (91.7% of the target). However, our 
event rate was significantly higher than expect-
ed. In a post hoc power analysis, we had 80% 
power to detect a 9.08% relative difference in the 
rate of the primary composite outcome between 
the two groups. Finally, the implementation of 
the trial in only one region of India limits the 
generalizability of the findings. Whether the 
BetterBirth program could achieve improvement 
in health outcomes in a setting with, for exam-
ple, higher baseline adherence to practices, a 
different health care system or facility-level or-
ganization, or a different patient population is 
not known.
We found that a coaching-based implementa-
tion of the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist had 
no significant effect on adverse maternal and 
perinatal health outcomes, despite positive ef-
fects on essential birth practices. High-quality 
research on large-scale programs to improve 
childbirth must continue to measure both pro-
cesses and outcomes of care because we cur-
rently lack a complete understanding of the com-
plex interaction among quality of care, context, 
and outcomes.
