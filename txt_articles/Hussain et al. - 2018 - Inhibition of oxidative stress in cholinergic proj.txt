Abstract Loss of the sense of smell is among the first signs of natural aging and
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Cellular and molecular
mechanisms promoting this smell loss are not understood. Here, we show that Drosophila
melanogaster also loses olfaction before vision with age. Within the olfactory circuit, cholinergic
projection neurons show a reduced odor response accompanied by a defect in axonal integrity and
reduction in synaptic marker proteins. Using behavioral functional screening, we pinpoint that
expression of the mitochondrial reactive oxygen scavenger SOD2 in cholinergic projection neurons
is necessary and sufficient to prevent smell degeneration in aging flies. Together, our data suggest
that oxidative stress induced axonal degeneration in a single class of neurons drives the functional
decline of an entire neural network and the behavior it controls. Given the important role of the
cholinergic system in neurodegeneration, the fly olfactory system could be a useful model for the
identification of drug targets.

In order to exploit Drosophila to characterize the mechanisms of neural circuit degeneration, we first
established that flies show a similar early aging-dependent decline in olfactory perception as humans
(Doty et al., 1984). In olfactory T-maze assays, where the animal’s preference or aversion for an
odor is recorded as an index of their approach or avoidance behavior toward the odorant, we found
that the performance to eight different (three attractive, five aversive) odors gradually declined with
age (Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D). This decline occurred also for behavior to
odors that are detected independent of the canonical olfactory receptor ORCO (olfactory receptor
co-receptor), and hence affected all tested odorants recognized by the three classes of olfactory
receptors (ORs, ionotropic receptors (IRs), and gustatory receptors (GRs); Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 1E–I). By contrast, the fly’s high attraction to blue light was not significantly different between

 1 and 10 weeks of age (Figure 1B) indicating that the flies were healthy enough to move and to
make decisions in this type of behavioral assay. These data argue that in flies, as observed in
humans, the sense of smell declines before and/or faster than the sense of vision.
We next sought to identify the underpinning neuronal and genetic mechanisms. First, we asked
whether all neurons were affected equally or whether perhaps particular neuron types within the
olfactory circuit were primary targets of aging. The architecture of the fly olfactory system parallels
that of vertebrates (Wilson, 2013). Olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axons connect to the antennal
lobe (AL), the equivalent of the olfactory bulb (OB), in the brain, where olfactory information is fur-
ther processed and transferred by second order projection neurons (PNs; analogs of mitral and
tufted cells) to higher brain centers (Figure 1C). A straightforward reason for a loss of sense of smell
could be a loss of OSNs or a reduction in their odor responsiveness, for instance through diminished
olfactory receptor expression. Yet, by counting the number of a subclass of OSNs we found no dif-
ference in the number of sensory neurons between young and older flies (e.g., 1 week vs. 10 weeks
Or42b-Gal4; UAS-mCD8GFP flies; Figure 2—figure supplement 1A), suggesting that OSNs do not
die during aging. Furthermore, we detected no significant difference in the size of OSN cell bodies
between young and old flies (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). In agreement with these data,
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of whole antennae demonstrated that olfactory receptor expression
including the expression of those responding to the tested odors and the obligatory co-receptor
ORCO, which is required for the detection of the majority of odors, was not significantly different
between young and old flies (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D).
We next investigated possible changes in the OSN’s ability to respond to an odor, by recording
spikes of neuronal activity in single sensillum recordings, where an electrode is inserted into individ-
ual olfactory sensilla (SSR; Figure 2—figure supplement 2A). While the response to two aversive

 odors, benzaldehyde and CO2 showed a significant decrease in the number of elicited spikes, none
of the other recordings using other odorants (six odors) showed a similar decline (Figure 2—figure
supplement 2B–H). This result did not change even when flies were first sorted by their response to
the odor in the T-maze behavioral assay. Flies that reacted to the odorant and flies that appeared to
not care showed similar SSR responses, which were also not significantly different between the age
groups (Figure 2—figure supplement 2J,K). Given that the behavior to odors without a decline in
SSR was similarly affected as the behavior to benzaldehyde and CO2, we concluded that a decrease
in OSN sensitivity is unlikely to be the general reason for the observed ageing-associated decline in
olfactory behavior. Altogether these experiments suggested that a degeneration of peripheral sen-
sory neurons is not the primary reason for the observed ageing-associated phenotype.
OSNs transmit their information to PNs in the central brain (~30 OSNs to one PN; Figure 1C).
The majority of PNs are cholinergic and can be labeled with the transgenic reporter line GH146-Gal4
(Figure 2A). To test whether PNs were functionally impaired, we used in vivo calcium imaging
(GH146-Gal4; UAS-GCaMP3.0) as a proxy of neuronal activity. We first recorded fluorescence
changes at the level of the AL, where the dendrites of these neurons receive input from the OSNs,
using epifluorescence microscopy (Figure 2B). The PN odor response in the responsive glomeruli
was significantly reduced at different concentrations including those used in the behavioral assays (1
mM, Figure 2B). With the exception of very few odors such as CO2, most odors activate multiple
glomeruli. To better distinguish glomerulus-specific responses, we turned to two-photon microscopy
and imaged GCaMP fluorescence changes at three different levels of the AL (Figure 2C,D). Here,
we observed that not all glomeruli were equally affected. While for each odor, one, normally very
responsive glomerulus showed a strong and significant decline, two other glomeruli were not signifi-
cantly affected by age (Figure 2C,C’,D,D’). The reason for why different glomeruli are differentially
affected is not know at this point. Differences in OSN number or olfactory receptor expression can,
according to the data shown above, likely be excluded. Currently, we can only speculate that the
degree of innervation by inhibitory or excitatory local neurons in the AL, other distinctive features,
the activity of the OSN-PN synapses, interaction between sister PNs, or even the interaction with
glia cells might play a role in these differences. Nonetheless, the current data strongly suggest that,
in contrast to OSNs, PNs are less activated by odors in old as compared to young flies.
PNs transfer their information mainly to two higher brain centers, the MB calyx and the LH. To
characterize PN function further, we also imaged GCaMP fluorescence changes at the level of PN
boutons in the calyx (Figure 2E–G). Remarkably, here the response per PN bouton was not signifi-
cantly weaker between flies of different ages (Figure 2F). However, the number of responsive bou-
tons was strongly reduced in old (4, 6 weeks) as compared to young flies (1 week; Figure 2G.
Therefore, PN function is affected by aging. Importantly, not only their dendritic response is reduced
in a glomerulus-specific manner, their axonal output to higher brain centers drastically diminishes
with age. The strength of this decline indicates that primarily axons and their synaptic output regions
might degenerate functionally or anatomically due to aging-related mechanisms.
These cellular data suggested that flies suffer from reduced odor sensitivity possibly due to a
decline of PN function and a subsequent reduction in information that arrives at higher brain centers.
Hence, we wondered whether the animals were still capable of odor recognition and valuation, if
compensated for the loss in sensitivity. Indeed, a 10-fold increase in odor concentration was suffi-
cient to markedly improve the old flies’ olfactory choice behavior indicating that old flies albeit a
decline in odor sensitivity still recognize and correctly valuate a given odor (Figure 2—figure sup-
plement 3).
To unravel the mechanism of this functional decline, we analyzed PN morphology in more detail
(Figure 3A). In contrast to OSNs, the number of PNs labeled by the reporter GH146 >mCD8-GFP
was mildly but significantly reduced in old as compared to younger flies (Figure 3B). In addition to
the mild loss of labeled PNs, their cell bodies had shrunk in older animals as compared to younger
animals (Figure 3C). Similar observations were made for other aging neurons including mitral cells in
aged humans (Sama-ul-Haq et al., 2008). Importantly, the pan-neuronally expressed gene elav was
somewhat upregulated relative to other genes in older brains as compared to its relative expression
in younger brains (Figure 3F) suggesting that neurons were not selectively lost as compared to other
cell types (e.g. glia) in aging Drosophila brains. Nevertheless, we observed a significant decrease in
ToPro staining, which labels cell nuclei in several areas including the AL (Figure 3G,H). Despite of
this, the expression level of the neuropil marker N-cadherin (Ncad) in the AL and in the region of the

 LH as judged by antibody staining was unchanged (see methods; Figure 3D). Similarly, the expres-
sion of the GCaMP reporter (normalized to Ncad staining) used for calcium imaging, was compara-
ble, or even slightly increased in PN axon terminals of old as compared to young flies (Figure 3E).
Therefore, the changes observed in PN odor responses are not likely to be attributable to gross
morphological changes in PN anatomy.
We next focused on expression and localization of markers of neuronal function to pinpoint a cel-
lular defect in the PNs that could explain the observed functional decline. As a reduction in choliner-
gic signaling accompanies most forms of neurodegeneration and natural aging (Doty, 2012), and
because PNs are cholinergic, we analyzed the expression of genes involved in cholinergic neuro-
transmission with RNA-sequencing. Our analysis revealed a significant decline in mRNA abundance
of several Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunits (Figure 3F). By contrast, some previously impli-
cated marker genes of systemic aging and lifespan did not change or increased in their expression
(Figure 3F). Expression levels are only one factor that might impact on cellular function. The proper
transport and localization of relevant proteins represents another critical point. As a proxy for synap-
tic integrity of the PNs, we expressed transgenic reporter constructs producing synapse-localized
fluorescent marker proteins. Such a reporter construct for the localization of Acetylcholine receptors
expressed in PNs (GH146 > Da7-GFP) revealed a moderate, but significant signal reduction of this
postsynaptic marker at PN postsynaptic sites in the AL indicating an aging-related change at the
post-synapse (Figure 3G,I).
It has been proposed that axonal degeneration precedes and possibly leads to eventual neuronal
loss in neurodegenerative diseases (Kurowska et al., 2016). Indeed, we observed that the Da7-GFP
reporter construct, which in young animals localizes not only to the post-synapse, but also, albeit to
a markedly lower extend, to the axon and presynaptic terminals of PNs (in 20/20 animals analyzed)
was completely absent from presynaptic terminals and axons in old flies (0/20 flies showed reporter
labeling in axon, MB calyx (cx) and lateral horn (LH)) (Figure 3G). In mammals, AChRs are also found
post-
and
pre-synaptically,
where
they
modulate
and
enhance
synaptic
signaling
(MacDermott et al., 1999).
Given the dramatic reduction of responsive presynaptic PN boutons in the MB calyx and the
reduced response in the AL observed by GCaMP imaging (see Figure 2), we employed antibody
staining against the enzyme ChAT (Choline Acetyltransferase) required for the production of Acetyl-
choline at synapses of cholinergic neurons such as the PNs. Quantification of these stained brains
indeed revealed a significant reduction in ChAT positive puncta in the AL and at the level of the MB
calyx (Figure 3J–L). ChAT staining in the LH, by contrast, remained relatively stable (Figure 3L).
Beyond a change in synaptic proteins in the aged synapse, several studies in animal models including
flies implicated mitochondrial dysfunction in neuronal, in particular axonal degeneration (Court and
Coleman, 2012; Humphrey et al., 2012; Valadas et al., 2015). The current hypotheses for why axo-
nal mitochondria are more vulnerable include the remote location of mitochondria in presynapses
from the cell body, and a high metabolic activity including calcium homeostasis (Court and Cole-
man, 2012). Indeed, we observed a strong reduction in the number of puncta that were positive for
a reporter construct for mitochondria (GH146 > mito-mcherry; (Vagnoni and Bullock, 2016) at the
level of the MB calyx (Figure 3K,L), but not in the AL or LH area (Figure 3J,L). These results sug-
gests that mitochondria are indeed depleted, lost, or not replenished selectively close to the remote
synapse in the calyx, while postsynaptic sites of the PNs in the AL are seemingly maintained. Why LH
synapses are not affected as compared to calyx synapses, given that they are actually further away
from the cell bodies than their calycal counterparts, remains currently unknown. Nevertheless,

 specific metabolic or synaptic characteristics of these different synapses and their postsynaptic part-
ners could be part of the explanation.
In the light of an apparent reduction of ChAT and mitochondria (or at least a mitochondria
reporter), we analyzed the integrity of these boutons in more detail using the high-resolution micros-
copy technique STED (Stimulated emission depletion; [Kittel et al., 2006; Willig et al., 2006]). To
this end, the expression of a GFP-tagged version of the presynaptic protein bruchpilot was
expressed in PNs (GH146 > BRP-shortGFP; Figure 3M). In line with the strong reduction of odor-
responsive boutons, quantitative STED analysis of this reporter revealed a strong decrease in the
density of presynaptic active zones over the MB calyx (Figure 3N). Correspondingly, the number of
postsynaptic densities as revealed by antibody staining against the postsynaptic density marker
Drep2 was reduced by a similar margin (Figure 3O) (Andlauer et al., 2014).
These data indicate that a degeneration of cholinergic PNs, in particular of their axon, their pre-
synaptic boutons and the corresponding synapses (i.e. active zones and postsynaptic densities),
resembling aspects of neurodegeneration in humans, could be involved in the loss of the sense of
smell.
Having identified a potential neuronal target of aging in the olfactory system, we next addressed
the genetic mechanisms underpinning aging-associated olfactory decline. Several key genes and
mechanisms have been identified in different model systems that contribute to systemic aging
(Lo
´pez-Otı
´n et al., 2013). To assess the mechanism of olfactory aging in our case, we used in vivo
RNAi to knock-down the expression of candidate genes previously implicated in systemic aging and
lifespan in the entire nervous system using a pan-neural transgenic driver line, elav-Gal4, or loss of
function mutants. Of the ~20 genes analyzed
the knock-down of only one gene, SOD2

While several AChR receptors were significantly downregulated in the brain, this was not the case in the antenna (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C). In
addition, several aging-related genes are upregulated in older brains. Selected genes are displayed and were color-labeled by gene ontology analysis

GFP, stained with anti-GFP antibody (green)) and ToPro nuclear marker (shown in pink) in the AL and lateral horn (LH). There is a decline at PN
postsynaptic sites in the AL supporting an aging-related decline in the integrity of cholinergic synapses. For instance, the localization of Da7 at
presynaptic terminals and axons is lost in old flies (n = 20/20) in contrast to young animals (n = 0/20). See missing signal in axon and presynaptic
terminals in the MB calyx and LH. Scale bar: 25 mm (H) Quantification of mean gray value (MGV) of ToPro staining of cell bodies in the area of the LH

suggests that ChAT does not decrease equally in all brain parts, but in particular in areas such as the MB calyx. Graphs display mean relative

 (mitochondrial form of superoxide dismutase) significantly affected olfactory behavior in young ani-
mals (Figure 4A; Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B). By contrast, knock-down of the cytoplasmic
form, SOD1, only resulted in a smaller but non-significant decrease in olfactory behavior
(Figure 4A). Sirt2 RNAi knock-down led to a mild, but not significant increase in odor attraction,
possibly reflecting the fact that Sirt2 is upregulated in older brains (Figure 4A). More generally, it
will be interesting to test overexpression of genes upregulated in aged brain for their role in neuro-
degeneration in the future.
SODs protect against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and SOD2 appears to be required for normal
lifespan (Kirby et al., 2002; Oka et al., 2015). Our RNA-seq data revealed that while SOD1 and
SOD2 expression remained unchanged in the antennae of old flies, both genes were expressed at
lower levels in older brains (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–C).
In addition to SOD1 and SOD2, other genes were significantly up- and downregulated in older
brains. Among the most significant up-regulated GO terms were proteolysis and defense/immunity
genes, while energy metabolism and oxidation process related genes ranked high in the list of
downregulated genes. For instance, genes belonging to the GO term ‘oxidation-reduction process’
were found to be significantly downregulated (FDR < 0.01), which corresponds to 128% more genes
than expected by chance (p=2.3e-14, Fisher Test). Similarly, 119 genes belonging to proteolysis GO
term were found to be significantly upregulated (FDR < 0.01), which corresponds to 59% more
genes than expected by chance (p=1.3e-8, Fisher Test) (Supplementary file 1 and 2). These results
were also well in line with our finding of a reduction of mitochondria in PN synapses (see Figure 3).
We next tested whether any particular neuron type in the olfactory system was most vulnerable
to oxidative stress, or whether this was a systemic effect. Notably, knock-down of SOD2 in OSNs
(ORCO-Gal4) had no effect on the flies’ olfactory attraction or aversion compared to genetic controls
(Figure 4B). By contrast, knock-down of SOD2 in PNs resulted in a significantly reduced odor attrac-
tion and odor aversion similar to the knock-down of SOD2 in all mature neurons (Figure 4C and Fig-
ure 4—figure supplement 2D). While ubiquitous or pan-neural knock-down of SOD2 with the same
construct as used here is lethal (flies die after ~3 days; (Kirby et al., 2002) and our own observa-
tions), knock-down of SOD2 in PNs did not reduce the flies’ life span significantly as compared to
the genetic controls, which were also used in the behavioral experiments (Figure 4—figure supple-
ment 3A). It is important to note, however, that given the well-known effects of genetic background
on lifespan, we limit our conclusion to the correlation of the lifespan of each individual test or control
group to their respective olfactory behavioral performance. In other words, an extremely short- or
long-lived animal might show unspecific reasons for behavioral deficits or improvements. Based on

not show a defect in olfactory preference behavior (see Figure 4—figure supplement 1A) (B) RNAi knock-down
of SOD2 in OSNs had no effect on the flies’ olfactory preference suggesting that OSNs might be less sensitive to
oxidative stress. Box plots show olfactory PIs of 1 week old flies expressing an RNAi knock-down construct for
SOD2 under the control of ORCO, which is expressed broadly in OSNs (ORCO-Gal4;UAS-SOD2-RNAi) and their
genetic controls to 2,3-butanedione, benzaldehyde and 3-octanol in the T-maze assay. (C) RNAi knock-down of
SOD2 in PNs using the GH146-Gal4 (GH146-Gal4;UAS-SOD2-RNAi), results in strongly diminished olfactory
preference of flies to 2,3-butanedione, benzaldehyde and 3-octanol. Box plots show median and upper/lower
quartiles (n = 8, 60 flies/trial, 30 ♀ and 30 ♂). All p-values were calculated via one-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni
multiple comparison posthoc test (ns >0.05, *p�0.05, **p�0.01, ***p�0.001).

 this, a reduced lifespan is unlikely to explain the strong behavioral phenotype, suggesting a high vul-
nerability of PNs and their central role in olfactory decline.
Does lack of SOD2 in PNs result in changes at the level of neuronal function and morphology sim-
ilar to what we observed for natural aging? To answer this, we carried out some of the same analysis
as done for aged flies (see Figures 2 and 3). First, we counted the number of PNs in 1 week old flies
where SOD2 was knocked-down under the control of GH146-Gal4 (GH146 > SOD2 i). In contrast to
the aged flies, the number of GCaMP reporter expressing PNs (GH146 > GCaMP; with or without
SOD2i) was not significantly different between the experimental group and controls (Figure 5A,B).
However, the size of the PN cell bodies was significantly smaller upon knock-down of SOD2 as com-
pared to controls (Figure 5C), similar to the decline of cell body size in old flies (see Figure 3).
Quantification of the expression of GCaMP stained with an anti-GFP antibody in the LH and calyx
revealed a small reduction, which was significant in the LH but not in the calyx, suggesting that the
relative expression level of GCaMP upon normalization to staining outside the LH and calyx, respec-
tively, remained at a similar level as compared to controls (Figure 5D). By contrast, antibody staining
against ChAT showed that the expression of this enzyme was significantly reduced in PN boutons in
the MB calyx (Figure 5E) indicating a reduction of functional cholinergic synapses – again in line with
the results in aged brains.
Next, we tested what the consequences of SOD2 lack meant for PN function by using two photon
in vivo calcium imaging of the PN boutons in the MB calyx (Figure 5F–H). While SOD2 knock-down
did not affect the responses of individual PN boutons to odor stimulation, the number of responsive
boutons was significantly reduced upon SOD2 knock-down in PNs (Figure 5G,H).
Taken together, reduction of SOD2 expression exclusively in PNs leads to behavioral, functional
and anatomical phenotypes that resemble several of the phenotypes observed in naturally aged
brains.
Systemic SOD2 overexpression can ameliorate memory deficits in a transgenic Alzheimer’s dis-
ease mouse model (Massaad et al., 2009). However, it is not known whether augmenting SOD2
exclusively in one neuron type, the so to speak potential seed or Achilles heel of degeneration, pre-
vents aging-associated decline of an entire circuit and its ability to control and drive behavior. We
found that overexpression of SOD2 exclusively in PNs fully rescued behavioral decline of 7 weeks
old flies, which behaved just like their 1 week old genetic counterparts (Figure 6A and Figure 6—
figure supplement 1A). Importantly, SOD2 overexpression in PNs did not significantly extend or
shorten the average lifespan of this group of flies as compared to the used genetic controls, which
were also used for behavioral analysis (Figure 4—figure supplement 3B). Although these results do
not allow strong conclusions regarding the effect on lifespan, they do, nevertheless, indicate a more
specific role of SOD2 in PNs, and that the behavioral improvement is unlikely to be a result of an
improved overall fitness of these animals. Furthermore, SOD2 expression under the control of
ORCO-Gal4 in OSNs did not rescue the behavior of old flies (Figure 6B and Figure 6—figure sup-
plement 1B). We conclude that cholinergic PNs represent key targets and possibly a ‘seed neuron’
population in aging-associated decline of the sense of smell. These results suggest that aging-
related degeneration and behavioral decline could be significantly delayed by preventing oxidative
damage in only one or few neuron types (see also [Seeley, 2017]).
The overexpression of SOD2 does currently not provide a feasible way to protect the nervous sys-
tem of humans during aging or during the onset or course of a neurodegenerative disease. A popu-
lar idea is that it might be possible to boost an organism’s ability to fight ROS by consuming a diet
high in antioxidants (Vaiserman and Marotta, 2016). We found that a diet high in Resveratrol, a
well-studied antioxidant shown to increase the expression of SOD2 in neurons (Fukui et al., 2010)
and with potential benefits against AD (Granzotto and Zatta, 2014), protected from olfactory
decline. The relatively small effect on the flies’ lifespan (Wood et al., 2004) (Figure 4—figure sup-
plement 3C) is unlikely to explain the observed behavioral improvement (Figure 6C and Figure 6—
figure supplement 1C). Notably, a 1 week Resveratrol treatment of younger flies did not affect
olfactory behavior as compared to solvent fed flies (Figure 6—figure supplement 1D) indicating
that Resveratrol might indeed counteract oxidative stress that builds up during aging. Thus, protec-
tion from oxidative stress, plausibly at least in part through protection of PNs, might help to main-
tain the function of the olfactory system in an aged individual.
Apart from certain diets and nutrients, the gut microbiome has been implicated in progression of
Parkinson’s disease and aging (Kong et al., 2016; Scheperjans et al., 2015). Recent studies show

weeks old (grey boxes) transgenic flies overexpressing SOD2 exclusively in projection neurons (PNs) (GH146-Gal4;UAS-SOD2) and their genetic controls
in response to attractive (2,3-butanedione) and aversive (3-octanol) odors. Note that expression of SOD2 exclusively in PNs fully rescues olfactory
performance in 7 weeks old flies indicating that sensitivity to oxidative stress of PNs represents a key player in the aging-associated decline of the
olfactory system. (B) Box plots show PIs of 1 week old (orange) and 7 weeks old (grey) transgenic flies overexpressing SOD2 under the control of
ORCO-Gal4 in OSNs (ORCO-Gal4;UAS-SOD2) and their genetic controls in response to attractive (2,3-butanedione) and aversive (3-octanol) odors.
Importantly, overexpression of SOD2 under the control of ORCO-Gal4 in OSNs had no effect on the behavior of old flies. (C) Box plots show

week old (light (treated) and dark orange (not germfree, standard conditions as in all other experiments before) and 7 weeks old (dark and light grey)
flies. Treated flies were inoculated with Lactobacillus plantarum NI202877, L. plantarum WJL, Acetobacter pomorum (A.p.), while control flies were just
raised on standard fly food. P.I.s of flies to the attractive odor 2,3-butanedione is shown. All p-values were calculated via two-way ANOVA with the
Bonferroni multiple comparison posthoc test (ns >0.05, *p�0.05, **p�0.01, ***p�0.001). Asterisks above a single box refer to p-values of comparison to
the control (7 weeks old treated control). Box plot show median and upper/lower quartiles (n = 8, 60 flies/trial 30 ♀ and 30 ♂). (E) Summary and model
of presented results. SOD2, the mitochondrial form of SOD, protects projection neurons (PN) from oxidative stress. Their vulnerability to oxidative
stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) appears to be the weak point of the olfactory system of Drosophila. The decline in function of PNs ultimately
results in strongly reduced sensitivity to odors and accordingly diminishes behavioural responses.

 produce the same effect suggesting a specific mechanism and not just the presence of any bacteria
in the gut. Oral administration of L. plantarum, which colonizes the mammalian gut, led to a signifi-
cant increase of SOD levels in serum and liver in a mouse aging model (Tang et al., 2016). More-
over, L.p.WJL modulates TOR and insulin signaling in Drosophila, both of which are regulators of
lifespan (Storelli et al., 2011). We tested the effect of these microbiota on olfactory aging. L.p.WJL
and A.p., but not L.p.NI202877, improved the old flies’ performance in olfactory preference assays
significantly (Figure 6D and Figure 6—figure supplement 1E). We conclude that certain microbiota
have a positive effect and slow-down aging-associated olfactory neurodegeneration.
Based on the data presented, we propose that due to their insufficient resistance to oxidative
stress, which is facilitated by an aging-associated decrease in SOD levels, functional degeneration
starting at the axon of specific cholinergic neurons is responsible for the decline of the olfactory cir-
cuit and the sense of smell (Figure 6E). A central role of cholinergic neurons in neurodegeneration
seems conserved. In C. elegans, a decline in cholinergic signaling likely triggers an aging-associated
decline in the sense of smell (Leinwand et al., 2015). In humans, cholinesterase inhibitors, which
augment levels of acetylcholine in the brain, represent the main class of Alzheimer drugs
(Canter et al., 2016). Using the Drosophila model, we showed that a specific type of cholinergic
neurons plays a key role in the loss of the sense of smell. Our data therefore provides experimental
evidence that declines in nervous system function are not due to a universal degeneration, but rather
that specific neuronal subsets are primarily or even solely responsible and might trigger further
degeneration throughout a neuronal network.
Why are certain neurons more sensitive than others? Similar to flies, axonal degeneration and
decline of cholinergic neurotransmission play important roles in neurodegeneration in humans.
Indeed, neurons with long axonal projections, broad input, high sensitivity and high action potential
frequency, such as PNs (Wilson, 2013), might be particularly vulnerable to aging. The olfactory sys-
tem of the fly could help to pinpoint the ‘Achilles heel’ of a neuron and aid the development of
more targeted treatments by combining high-throughput genetic screening with drug or microbiota
treatments.

Aging and recording of lifespan
100 flies (50 males and 50 females) were flipped onto fresh food every second day for up to 10
weeks. For lifespan recordings, flies were counted every other day or once a week. Please note that
conclusions regarding lifespan might be confounded by genetic background etc. as flies have not
been backcrossed for 10 generations or more. However, the lifespan experiments were carried out
solely to be able to correlate the lifespan of each group of flies to its respective behavioral, physio-
logical, or anatomical phenotype.
Olfactory T-Maze assay
1–10 weeks old flies collected on the same day were used for all experiments and tested on the
same day side by side. For experiments with RNAi, experimental flies and genetic controls were
raised at 30˚C to enhance the effect of the RNAi. Flies were tested in groups of ~60 (30 females and
30 males) in a T-maze and were allowed 1 min to make a decision to go into either arm. Experimen-
tation was carried out within climate-controlled boxes at 25˚C and 60% rH in the dark. 50 ml of fresh
odor solution (all odors were purchased at Sigma-Aldrich) at different concentrations diluted in dis-
tilled water or paraffin oil applied on Whatman chromatography paper was provided in the odor
tube, except for 1% CO2, which was diluted using a custom-build setup with mass flow controller
from pure CO2 and bottled air. Control tubes were filled with 50 ml odorant solvent or compressed
air in the case of CO2. Unless otherwise indicated, 1 mM of odor dilution was used. After experimen-
tation, the number of flies in each tube was counted. An olfactory preference index (P.I.) was calcu-
lated by subtracting the number of flies on the test odor site from the number of flies on the control
site and normalizing by the total number of flies. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA
and the Bonferroni multiple comparisons posthoc test using Prism GraphPad 6.
Visual T-maze assay
Experiments were essentially carried out as described above, but with a visual instead of an olfactory
stimulus. A modified transparent T-maze apparatus was used to allow stimulation with light. The two
arms of the T-maze were illuminated with blue LED emitting lights (465–470 nm) on one side or red
LED lights (625–630 nm) on the other side. by subtracting the number of flies on the test odor site
from the number of flies on the control site and normalizing by the total number of flies. Statistical
analysis was performed using ANOVA and the Bonferroni multiple comparisons posthoc test using
Prism GraphPad 6.
In some experiments flies were videotracked by using an infrared camera on the top of the cli-
mate box and analyzed with ctrax software.
Treatment with Lactobacillus plantarum or Acetobacter pomorum
200 fly embryos (12 hr AEL) were collected in a petri dish, washed with 10% bleach once, in 70% eth-
anol twice, in PBS once, and in sterile, distilled water twice. These embryos are considered germfree
and are referred to as treated. Embryos were then transferred into new food bottles. An overnight
L. plantarum culture was concentrated to OD:200 and 300 ml were added into the fly food every
third day.
Treatment with resveratrol
For Resveratrol-supplemented diets, Resveratrol was dissolved in 100% ethanol and added to fly
food to a final concentration of 100 mM. All diets contained 1.5% agar and equal amounts of
ethanol.

 Anatomy
Adult fly brains were dissected, fixed, and stained as described previously (Hartl et al., 2011).
Briefly, brains were dissected in cold PBS, fixed with paraformaldehyde (2%, overnight at 4˚C or for
2 hr at RT), washed in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% donkey serum and stained overnight at 4˚ C or
for 2 hr at RT with the primary and after washes in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 with the secondary anti-
body using the same conditions. All microscopic observations were made at an Olympus FV-1000 or
at a Leica SP8 confocal microscope. Images were processed using ImageJ and Photoshop. The fol-
lowing antibodies were used: chicken anti-GFP and anti-RFP (molecular probes, 1:100), rat anti-N-
cadherin (anti-N-cad DN-Ex #8, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, 1:100), and mouse anti-
ChAT (Yasuyama et al., 1995). Secondary antibodies used were: anti-chicken Alexa 488 (molecular
probes, 1:250), a-mouse Alexa 633 (molecular probes, 1:250) and anti-rabbit Alexa 549 (molecular
probes, 1:250), respectively.
For image quantification, all brains were processed at the same time using the same conditions.
Images were taken at the exact same settings. All analysis was done blind to the genotype or age of
the flies. For the quantification of cell bodies, neurons were counted section-by-section either
directly at the confocal or using ImageJ/FIJI software. For antibody staining or reporter construct
expression at the level of the lateral horn (LH), images were Z-projected into a single image. Regions
of interest (ROI) were drawn around the LH in each image and quantification was carried out using
FIJI ImageJ software. For quantification of stainings in the antennal lobe (AL) and calyx, three sec-
tions at similar levels of the structures were chosen. ROIs were drawn around the AL or calyx in each
section and combined to quantify each individual brain. For each brain, only one LH, calyx and AL
were chosen randomly for quantifications. For quantification of staining intensity, different strategies
were used depending on the staining. For GCaMP staining, all stainings were normalized to Ncad
antibody staining. For Da7-GFP and ToPro staining, staining intensity was measured as mean grey
value (MGV) and normalized to the size of the area that was measured. For quantification of ChAT
and mito-RFP staining in Figure 3, ratios of stainings were calculated by dividing the MGV in the
area of interest by another brain area of equal size next to it, that is, in a region of the brain just
below the calyx that did not express the protein or the reporter or that did not belong to the region
of interest. With the aim to calculate how brain areas were affected by aging relative to each other.
A decrease in the ratio showed that the MGV in for instance the calyx was more strongly decreased
as compared to another brain area. For Figure 5, ChAT staining was quantified as MGV. Measure-
ments of cell body size diameter were carried out in ImageJ/FIJI. 3 cell bodies were measured per
section in several sections of the brain or antenna. The averages of the measured diameters were
used for statistical analysis.
All statistical analysis was carried out with GraphPad Prism software. The exact statistics used in
each experiment are indicated in the respective figure legends. Of note, different absolute values
are the result of the use of two different confocal microscopes; the newer Leica SP8 was significantly
more sensitive as compared to the older Olympus FV1000. As the result, individual settings for each
microscope were used and absolute number can only be compared within each individual graph.
Immunostaining for STED microscopy
Brains were dissected in Ringer’s solution (pH 7.3, 290–310 mOsm) containing 5 mM HEPES-NaOH,
130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, and 36 mM sucrose, fixed in 4% PFA for 2 hr
at 4˚C and washed three times for 10 min each in PBS containing 0.6% Triton X-100 (PBT) at room
temperature. Samples were incubated for 2 hr in PBT containing 2% BSA and 5% normal goat
serum. Subsequently, the samples were incubated in the primary antibody diluted in block solution
at 4˚C overnight. For staining BRP-shortGFP, FluoTag-X4 anti-GFP, Abberior Star 635P-conjugated
(1:100, NanoTag Biotechnologies, N0304-Ab635P) and for staining postsynaptic densities of Kenyon
cells, rabbit anti-Drep- 2C-Term (1: 500, Andlauer et al., 2014) were used. Samples were washed
three times for at least 30 min each in PBT containing 2% BSA (PAT) at room temperature, subse-
quently incubated with secondary antibody diluted in PAT overnight at 4˚C. As secondary antibody
AlexaFluor-594-coupled goat anti-rabbit (1: 200, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-11012) was used. Brains
were washed at least six times for 30 min each in PBT and embedded in Prolong Gold Antifade (Invi-
trogen). Samples were stored for 24 hr at room temperature followed by 48 hr at 4˚C, before STED
microscopy.

 Two-Color STED imaging
STED imaging with time-gated detection was performed on a Leica SP8 TCS STED microscope
(Leica Microsystems) equipped with a pulsed white light excitation laser (NKT Photonics). Dual-chan-
nel STED imaging was performed by sequentially exciting Abberior Star 635P and Alexa 594 at 646
nm and 598 nm, respectively. Both dyes were depleted with a 775 nm STED laser. Three optical sec-
tions at a distance of 250 nm were acquired with an HC PL APO CS2 100�/1.40 N.A. oil objective
(Leica Microsystems), a scanning format of 1024 � 1024 pixel, eight bit sampling and six fold zoom,
yielding a pixel dimension of 18.9 � 18.9 nm. Time-gated detection was set from 0.3 to 6 ns for all
dyes. To minimize thermal drift, the microscope was housed in a heatable incubation chamber (LIS
Life Imaging Services).
For quantifications, raw data obtained from STED imaging were de-convoluted using Huygens
Professional (Scientific Volume Imaging, Netherlands) and analyzed by a custom-written ImageJ
macro. Briefly, z-stacks of de-convoluted images were projected and each channel was segmented
using the auto local threshold method ‘Phansalkar’ followed by watershed separation of touching
segmented particles. The number, area fraction, and feret diameter from all segmented particles
with sizes from 5 to 200 pixels were measured in >4 separate images per calyx region.
In vivo calcium imaging
For calcium imaging experiments with an epifluorescence microscope, GCaMP3 was expressed
under the control of GH146-Gal4 (flies were heterozygous for both transgenes). Female flies were
prepared in a modified setup according to a method previously reported (Hussain et al.,
2016b2016b). In vivo preparations were imaged using a Leica DM6000FS fluorescent microscope
equipped with a 40x water immersion objective and a Leica DFC360 FX fluorescent camera. All
images were acquired with the Leica LAS AF E6000 image acquisition suit. Images were acquired for
20 s at a rate of 20 frames per second with 4 � 4 binning mode. To calculate the normalized change
in the relative fluorescence intensity, we used the following formula: DF/F = 100(Fn-F0)/F0, where Fn
is the nth frame after stimulation and F0 is the averaged basal fluorescence of 15 frames before stim-
ulation. The peak fluorescence intensity change is calculated as the mean of normalized trace over a
2 s time window during the stimulation period. During all measurements, the exposure time was
kept constant at 20 ms. For all experiments with odor stimulation, the stimulus was applied 5 s after
the start of each measurement. A continuous and humidified airstream (2000 ml/min) was delivered
to the fly throughout the experiment via an 8 mm diameter glass tube positioned 10 mm away from
the preparation. A custom-made odor delivery system (Smartec, Martinsried), consisting of mass
flow controllers (MFC) and solenoid valves, was used for delivering a continuous airstream and stim-
uli in all experiments. In all experiments, stimuli were delivered for 500 ms, and during stimulations
the continuous flow was maintained at 2000 ml/min. For odorant stimulations, 1 ml of a precise con-
centration was filled in the odor delivery cup and the collected airspace odor was injected into the
main airstream to give 0 mM, 0.1 mM, 1 mM, and 10 mM final concentrations for 500 ms without
changing airstream strength. To measure the fluorescent intensity change, the region of interest was
delineated by hand and the resulting time trace was used for further analysis. To calculate the nor-
malized change in the relative fluorescence intensity, we used the following formula: DF/F = 100
(FnF0)/F0, where Fn is the nth frame after stimulation and F0 is the averaged basal fluorescence of
15 frames before stimulation. The peak fluorescence intensity change is calculated as the mean of
normalized trace over a 2 s time window during the stimulation period. The pseudo-colored images
were generated in MATLAB using a custom written program. All analysis and statistical tests were
done using Excel and GraphPad6 Prism software, respectively.
For live imaging using two-photon microscopy, flies were homozygous for both GH146-Gal4 and
the UAS-GCaMP3 construct. Female transgenic flies (5–6 day, 4 week and 6 weeks old) were used
for imaging experiments. Imaging was performed using two-photon microscope (Leica) equipped
with a 20x water-immersion objective (NA = 1, Leica). GCaMP3 was excited at 920 nm. A custom-
built device was used as odor delivery system to supply odors with a constant flow rate of 1 ml/s to
the fly’s antennae for 2 s. Onset and duration of the odor stimulus were controlled using a custom-
written LABVIEW program. Images were recorded at 5 Hz. Image processing and analysis was per-
formed using Fiji software. For correcting the potential slight movements in x-y direction, recorded
images were aligned using TurboReg plugin (The
´venaz et al., 1998). Afterwards, regions of interest

 (ROIs) were manually defined. In the antennal lobe, individual glomeruli and in the calyx, individual
presynaptic boutons were selected as ROIs. For signal quantification, the average pixel intensity of
five frames before stimulus onset was determined as F. DF is the difference between fluorescence
and F, and resulting values were divided by F and displayed as percent.
In vivo electrophysiology
Single sensillum recordings (SSR) are extracellular recordings performed from antennal olfactory sen-
silla as previously described (Hartl et al., 2011). A single fly was wedged into narrow end of a trun-
cated 200 ml pipette tip and placed on a slide under the objective. The fly head was exposed and
stabilized on top of a glass coverslip. The antennae were hold by the tip of a glass capillary. An odor
delivery pipette blew continuous air-streams to the antenna providing odor stimulations of different
concentrations (SYNTECH, the Netherlands). A glass reference electrode filled with ringer (0.01 mM
KCl) was inserted into the fly eye gently by a micromanipulator (Sutter instruments). And a glass
recording electrode filled with ringer (0.01 mM KCl) was pushed against a sensillum until it pierced
the cuticular wall of the sensillum. The recording of action potentials (APs) was started after an
observation of spontaneous responses of olfactory neurons. The AC signals (10–2800 Hz) of the
responses were amplified 500x (Multiclamp 700B, United States) and were analyzed with Clam-
pex10.3 software (Digidata 1440A, the United States). The signals to a particular stimulus were
recorded 5 s before giving the odor stimulation. The responses of neurons were calculated by count-
ing the number of APs for 0.5 s during the response minus the number of APs for 0.5 s before the
response (spikes/s). Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA using GraphPad Prism
software.
RNA-sequencing
RNA was extracted and sequencing was carried out using standard methods and as previously
described (Hussain et al., 2016a). RNA-sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 2000/
2500 sequencer suite.
Statistical methods for RNA-seq and gene ontology analysis
Gene expression data was normalized by size factors and tested for differential expression using
DESeq2 package (v. 1.16.1) (Love et al., 2014) in R (v. 3.4.0). Significant up and down regulated
genes were classified according to their log2 fold change and adjusted p-value<0.01. Then, up and
down regulated genes were analyzed separately to obtain enriched gene ontology terms using
topGO package (v. 2.28.0) in R and the D. melanogaster gene ontology annotation database
gene_association.fb (http://www.flybase.org).
