Summary
Background Blood biomarkers of neuronal damage could facilitate clinical management of and therapeutic 
development for Huntington’s disease. We investigated whether neurofilament light protein NfL (also known as 
NF-L) in blood is a potential prognostic marker of neurodegeneration in patients with Huntington’s disease.
Methods We did a retrospective analysis of healthy controls and carriers of CAG expansion mutations in HTT 
participating in the 3-year international TRACK-HD study. We studied associations between NfL concentrations in 
plasma and clinical and MRI neuroimaging findings, namely cognitive function, motor function, and brain volume 
(global and regional). We used random effects models to analyse cross-sectional associations at each study visit and to 
assess changes from baseline, with and without adjustment for age and CAG repeat count. In an independent 
London-based cohort of 37 participants (23 HTT mutation carriers and 14 controls), we further assessed whether 
concentrations of NfL in plasma correlated with those in CSF.
Findings Baseline and follow-up plasma samples were available from 97 controls and 201 individuals carrying HTT 
mutations. Mean concentrations of NfL in plasma at baseline were significantly higher in HTT mutation carriers 
than in controls (3·63 [SD 0·54] log pg/mL vs 2·68 [0·52] log pg/mL, p<0·0001) and the difference increased from 
one disease stage to the next. At any given timepoint, NfL concentrations in plasma correlated with clinical and MRI 
findings. In longitudinal analyses, baseline NfL concentration in plasma also correlated significantly with subsequent 
decline in cognition (symbol-digit modality test r=–0·374, p<0·0001; Stroop word reading r=–0·248, p=0·0033), total 
functional capacity (r=–0·289, p=0·0264), and brain atrophy (caudate r=0·178, p=0·0087; whole-brain r=0·602, 
p<0·0001; grey matter r=0·518, p<0·0001; white matter r=0·588, p<0·0001; and ventricular expansion r=–0·589, 
p<0·0001). All changes except Stroop word reading and total functional capacity remained significant after 
adjustment for age and CAG repeat count. In 104 individuals with premanifest Huntington’s disease, NfL 
concentration in plasma at baseline was associated with subsequent clinical onset during the 3-year follow-up period 
(hazard ratio 3·29 per log pg/mL, 95% CI 1·48–7·34, p=0·0036). Concentrations of NfL in CSF and plasma were 
correlated in mutation carriers (r=0·868, p<0·0001).
Interpretation NfL in plasma shows promise as a potential prognostic blood biomarker of disease onset and 
progression in Huntington’s disease.

Introduction
Huntington’s disease is a slowly progressive neuro­
degenerative disorder for which no proven disease­
modifying treatments yet exist. Knowledge of its genetic 
cause, CAG repeat expansions in the HTT gene leading 
to the formation of mutant huntingtin (mHTT), has 
enabled focused study of the disease and the development 
of advanced therapeutics targeting known aspects of its 
pathobiology.1
Although extensive efforts have established well char­
acterised clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging bio 
markers 
of progression,2–5 few biochemical markers have been 
iden 
ti 
fied that enable direct assessment of relevant aspects 
of pathology.6,7 No prognostic biomarkers for assessing 
neuronal damage, disease progression, or therapeutic 
response have been validated, which limits the ability to 
test novel therapeutics, especially in mutation carriers with 
premanifest Huntington’s disease for whom treatment is 
most likely to result in long­term meaningful benefits. 
Accessible, reliable, biochemical markers would greatly 
facilitate the development of novel therapeutics for 
Huntington’s disease.1
Many potential markers in CSF have been proposed, but 
only a few (eg, mHTT itself, microtubule­associated 
protein tau, and chitinase­3­like protein 1) have shown 
associations with clinical phenotype beyond established

predictors, such as age and HTT CAG triplet repeat 
count.7–10 None of the potential biomarkers has been 
studied longitudinally.7 Moreover, CSF is more difficult 
and expensive to obtain than other fluids, but no substance 
detectable in a highly accessible biofluid, such as blood, 
has robustly reflected Huntington’s disease­related alter­
ations due to CNS pathology, either in cross­sectional or 
longitudinal studies. We previously showed that mHTT 
concentrations in blood leucocytes were associated with 
clinical severity cross­sectionally,11 but that this was 
probably due to peripheral mHTT production rather than 
CNS pathology. This and other such markers of peripheral 
pathology,12 therefore, are poor candidates for trials 
involving direct CNS delivery of disease­modifying agents.
Neurofilament light protein (NfL, also known as NF­L) 
is the smallest of three subunits that make up neuro­
filaments, which are major components of the neuronal 
cytoskeleton. NfL is released from damaged neurons. 
Concentrations in CSF are increased in people with 
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s 
disease,13 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,13 and fronto­
temporal dementia.13,14 Four small­scale cross­sectional 
studies found raised concentrations of NfL in the CSF 
of individuals with Huntington’s disease,8,15–17 and we 
have shown a close association between increased con­
cen 
trations of NfL and mHTT in CSF.8
NfL is detectable in blood plasma or serum. Cross­
sectional studies have shown increased concentrations in 
blood 
in 
people 
with 
frontotemporal 
dementia,18 
Alzheimer’s 
disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,19 and atypical 
parkinsonism,20 and in longitudinal studies of those with 
frontotemporal dementia,21,22 amyotrophic lateral scler­
osis,23 and progressive supranuclear palsy.24 A 1­year study 
followed up 147 patients with progressive supranuclear 
palsy, but these cohorts were genetically and pathologically 
heterogeneous and only a few included premanifest 
individuals, in small numbers.24 NfL concentrations in 
blood 
have 
not 
been 
reported 
in 
people 
with 
Huntington’s disease.
We aimed to investigate whether NfL in plasma could 
act as a potential prognostic marker of neurodegeneration 
and disease progression for Huntington’s disease. The 
study involved the 366 participants of the TRACK­HD 
cohort,5,25 who had been assessed by standardised blood 
sampling, clinical testing, and MRI annually over 3 years. 
This cohort offers a unique resource for studying 
neurodegeneration in a genetically uniform disease cohort 
and for assessing changes at different stages of disease, 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed by use of the MeSH terms “([intermediate 
filaments] AND [nerve degeneration OR Huntington disease OR 
Alzheimer disease OR Parkinson disease OR Pick disease of the 
brain OR frontotemporal dementia OR amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis OR supranuclear palsy, progressive] AND [blood OR 
plasma OR serum OR cerebrospinal fluid] AND [humans])” and 
their natural language variants for human studies of 
neurofilament light protein (NfL, also known as NF-L) in 
neurodegenerative disorders. Four small cross-sectional studies 
reported raised concentrations of NfL in the CSF of people with 
Huntington’s disease, and four longitudinal studies had 
assessed blood NfL concentrations in other disorders. The 
largest longitudinal study of people with neurodegenerative 
disease measured NfL in 174 patients with progressive 
supranuclear palsy over 1 year. The largest study of 
neurodegenerative disease onset was done in 34 GRN mutation 
carriers with premanifest frontotemporal dementia, among 
whom only two had disease progression during follow-up. The 
association between concentrations of NfL in plasma has never 
been reported in people with Huntington’s disease. We 
investigated whether NfL concentrations in plasma could serve 
as a potential prognostic marker of neurodegeneration in a 
genetically homogeneous cohort of HTT CAG expansion 
mutation carriers, including a substantial subgroup with 
premanifest disease, followed up over 3 years.
Added value of this study
Increased concentrations of NfL in plasma were seen 
throughout the course of Huntington’s disease and, after 
controlling for age and CAG repeat count, were independently 
associated with cognitive and motor dysfunction and global 
and regional brain volume at any given timepoint. We also 
found a strong association between increased NfL 
concentration and CAG repeat count, which suggests a firm 
link between this factor and the genetic basis of Huntington’s 
disease. In HTT mutation carriers with premanifest disease at 
baseline, increased concentration of NfL in plasma at baseline 
was associated with subsequent clinical onset beyond the 
known prognostic variables of age, CAG repeat count, and 
brain volume; such an association has not previously been 
found for other potential biofluid biomarkers. Associations 
were also seen with disease progression assessed by cognitive, 
functional, and brain atrophy measures. In an independent 
cohort of 37 individuals (23 HTT mutation carriers and 
14 controls), we showed a strong correlation between raised 
NfL concentrations in plasma and matched CSF.
Implications of all the available evidence
Measurement of NfL in plasma could be useful to assess the 
risk of Huntington’s disease onset and progression beyond 
currently known prognostic factors. Our findings in 
individuals with premanifest Huntington’s disease suggest 
that NfL has potential as a biomarker in the preclinical 
phases of other neurodegenerative diseases. The availability 
of accessible, reliable biochemical markers might also be 
useful in assessing novel therapeutics. Finally, this study 
affirms the benefits of systematically studying genetically 
homogeneous cohorts to assess the earliest changes in 
neurodegeneration.

including in the premanifest phase. We tested the 
hypotheses that NfL concentrations would be raised in 
individuals with Huntington’s disease, would increase as 
disease progressed, and that concentrations would corre­
late with disease onset in HTT mutation carriers with 
premanifest Huntington’s disease and with clinical pro­
gression in those with manifest disease, therefore acting 
as an indicator of neurodegeneration. We addition 
ally 
investigated whether concentrations of NfL in CSF would 
correlate with those in plasma.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a retrospective study involving 366 participants 
enrolled in the TRACK­HD study at four inter 
­
national study sites in 2008. Participants were assessed 
annually with standardised 3­Tesla T1 volumetric MRI, 
clini 
cal, cognitive, quantitative motor, and neuro­
psychiatric assessments, as previously described.25 The 
study protocol is available online. At enrolment, 
participants with HTT CAG expansion mutations were 
classified as having premanifest or manifest Huntington’s 
disease based on the Unified Huntington’s Disease 
Rating Scale (UHDRS) Total Motor Score (TMS). 
Participants with premanifest disease were further 
separated into two subgroups of early and late 
premanifest disease (termed preHD A and preHD B in 
some other TRACK­HD publications), with the group 
median for predicted number of years to onset of 
manifest disease (10·8) as the threshold. Using the 
UHDRS Total Functional Capacity (TFC) score, patients 
with manifest Huntington’s disease were separated into 
subgroups with clinical stage 1 (TFC score >10) and 
stage 2 (TFC score 7–10) disease. Controls were healthy 
partners or siblings of HTT mutation carriers. All human 
studies are compliant with the Declaration of Helsinki 
and approved by local ethics committees, and all 
participants gave written informed consent.
Clinical and imaging assessments
T1 volumetric MRI scans were subjected to rigorous 
quality control followed by analysis by operators unaware 
of participants’ statuses at specialist image analysis sites 
with use of optimised, standardised techniques, as 
previously described.5 Briefly, cross­sectional putamen 
volumes were calculated by automated segmentation; 
whole­brain, 
caudate, 
lateral 
ventricles, 
and 
total 
intracranial volumes by semiautomated segmentation; 
and grey­matter and white­matter volumes by voxel­based 
morphometry. Longitudinal changes in whole­brain, 
ventricles, and caudate were calculated with the boundary 
shift integral technique, and changes in grey­matter and 
white­matter volume were assessed with voxel compression 
mapping within voxel­based morphometry segmentations.5 
All cross­sectional imaging measures were calculated as a 
percentage of total intracranial volume. Cognitive function 
was assessed with the Symbol­Digit Modality Test (SDMT) 
and Stroop Word Reading (SWR) task, and clinical severity 
was assessed with the UHDRS TMS and TFC.25
NfL quantification in plasma
At each TRACK­HD visit, blood was collected in BD 
Vacutainer tubes containing edetic acid (Franklin Lakes, 
NJ, USA.). Samples were processed onsite to isolate 
plasma, as previously described.26 Plasma samples were 
frozen, stored at –80°C, then shipped frozen for analysis 
by operators unaware of participants’ disease statuses. 
NfL concentrations were quantified with an ultrasensitive 
single­molecule array method.18 All NfL values were 
within the linear ranges of the assays.
CSF cohort
A London­based independent cohort of 37 participants 
(14 controls, three HTT mutation carriers with premanifest 
disease [UHDRS diagnostic confidence scores <4], and 
20 participants with manifest Huntington’s disease) 
underwent CSF and plasma collection standardised for diet, 
time of day, clinical procedures, and processing.8 Blood was 
collected within 30 min of CSF in sodium heparin cell­
preparation BD Vacutainer tubes and processed to isolate 
plasma. NfL concentrations in CSF were quantified with a 
commercial ELISA, used according to the manufacturer’s 
protocol (UmanDiagnostics, Umeå, Sweden).8
Statistical analysis
Analysis of plasma NfL in TRACK­HD was done per a 
prespecified statistical plan that was designed with and 
done by a statistician experienced in analysing the 
TRACK­HD dataset (DL). Outcomes of interest (UHDRS 
TMS, UHDRS TFC, SWR, SDMT, and volumes of whole­
brain, caudate, putamen, lateral ventricles, grey matter, 
and white matter) were chosen because they had 
the strongest effect sizes in TRACK­HD.5 Clinical and 
imaging data were paired to NfL concentrations in plasma 
at each study visit. Longitudinal changes were calculated 
over the longest available period and converted to 
annualised rates.
NfL concentrations in plasma were non­normally 
distributed because of biologically plausible higher 
values. Natural log­transformation produced plausibly 
normal distributions and was used for all analyses. 
Longitudinal changes in UHDRS TMS were calculated 
by square­root transformation of cross­sectional values.
ANOVA was used to compare groups at baseline. Other 
cross­sectional associations were assessed for individuals’ 
baseline and follow­up measurements in linear models 
that included a random participant effect. Sex and study 
site were not significantly associated with NfL and, 
therefore, were not included as covariates. When 
controlling for the interacting effects of age and CAG 
repeat count (known prognostic factors for progression 
of Huntington’s disease), we used a polynomial model 
that included linear and squared terms for variables and 
interactions between them, since in our observations of

other Huntington’s disease phenomena such higher 
order terms have often been significantly associ 
ated with 
progression.
Longitudinal changes in NfL concentrations were 
assessed with correlated random intercept and slope 
models. UHDRS TFC changes are negligible in 
individuals with premanifest Huntington’s disease and, 
therefore, longitudinal analyses of changes in this 
measure were restricted to individuals with manifest 
Huntington’s disease. For simplicity, we describe 
longitudinal associations with Pearson’s correlations 
between cross­sectional NfL concentrations and other 
outcomes, and between baseline NfL concentrations and 
the annualised rates of change in other outcomes, 
calculated from data available at the last available 
assessment. However, all p values are derived from 
analogous random effects repeated measurement models, 
which allow proper inference but lack unambiguously 
defined corresponding correlation statistics.
We used Cox proportional hazard survival modelling to 
calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the 
correlation between baseline NfL concentration and sub­
sequent onset of Huntington’s disease within 3 years in 
premanifest HTT mutation carriers. The small number of 
confirmed new diagnoses (n=18) precluded simul 
taneous 
inclusion of multiple covariates, but their pattern was 
consistent with the proportional odds assumption. Thus, 
other known risk factors previously identified in the 
TRACK­HD data5,27 were controlled separately to assess 
non­redundancy of NfL con 
centrations as a risk factor.
The data for the independent CSF cohort were analysed 
without log transformation. Participants with premanifest 
and manifest Huntington’s disease were pooled to create 
one Huntington’s disease group. We used Wilcoxon’s 
rank sum test to compare groups, and Pearson’s corre­
lation coefficient and partial correlations with bootstrap 
estimates of SEs with 1000 replications to assess associ­
ations between variables.
The threshold for statistical significance for all analyses 
was p<0·05. Where prominent outliers remained after 
normal 
isation, they were excluded and analyses were 
repeated to evaluate their influence. The analysis was 
carried out in SAS (v9.4, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA) 
using SAS/STAT 14.1.

Results
Of 366 TRACK­HD participants, baseline and follow­up 
plasma samples were available from 298 (81%) who 
completed the 3­year TRACK­HD study (97 controls and 
201 HTT mutation carriers—58 with early premanifest 
and 46 with late premanifest disease, and 66 with stage 1 
and 31 with stage 2 Huntington’s disease). 293 had paired 
plasma samples from the 3­year follow­up visit, four from 
the 2­year visit, and one from the 1­year visit. The 
demographic and clinical characteristics of participants at 
baseline are presented in the appendix.
Concentrations of NfL in plasma at baseline were 
2·6 times higher before log transformation in HTT mu­
tation carriers than in controls (mean 3·63 [SD 0·54] log 
pg/mL vs 2·68 [0·52] log pg/mL, p<0·00001). Baseline NfL 
concentrations in plasma were significantly higher in all 
disease stage subgroups among HTT mutation carriers 
than those in controls (all p<0·0001, figure 1 and appendix). 
Additionally, NfL concen 
trations differed significantly with 
increasing disease stage except stage 2 versus stage 1

Huntington’s disease (figure 1 and appendix). The stage 2 
manifest subgroup did, however, differ significantly from 
the early premanifest subgroup (mean difference 0·785 
[SE 0·113], p<0·0001) and the late premanifest subgroup 
(0·348 [0·102], p=0·0017).
We found positive associations between NfL con­
centrations in plasma and age in controls and all 
Huntington’s disease subgroups. In controls, the 
association was roughly linear (slope 0·02 log pg/mL per 
year [SE 0·0042], p<0·0001; figure 1B). In HTT mutation 
carriers there was a significant positive association 
between NfL con 
centration in plasma and the CAG­age 
product, which measures the extent of exposure to the 
effects of the CAG expansion (appendix),4 but the non­
linear association with age and CAG triplet repeat count 
was best described by CAG­repeat­count­dependent 
quadratic functions of age (appendix). The association is 
clear when each CAG count is considered separately 
(figure 1B, appendix) and shows that for a given age, overall 
NfL concentrations in plasma increased with increasing 
CAG repeat count, and that the steepness of the slopes 
declined with increasing age. Thus, maximum predicted 
NfL concentrations at older ages became similar.
In HTT mutation carriers, NfL concentrations in plasma 
at baseline were negatively associated with cognitive score 
on the SDMT and SWR and with the MRI measures of 
brain volume for putamen, caudate, grey matter, and white 
matter (higher NfL values were associated with smaller 
brain volumes, figure 2). These associations remained 
significant after adjustment for the combined effects of 
age and CAG repeat count (r=–0·293, p<0·0001 for SDMT, 
r=–0·239, p=0·0042 for SWR; r=–0·286, p<0·0001 for 
putamen, r=–0·187, p=0·017 for caudate, r=–0·198, 
p=0·0004 for grey matter, and r=–0·121, p=0·048 for white 
matter; appendix). The exception was whole­brain volume, 
which showed a significant negative association before 
adjust 
ment (r=–0·447, p<0·0001), but not after (r=–0·120, 
p=0·150). Significant positive associations were seen with 
UHDRS TMS (higher NfL values were associated with 
worse motor performance) and lateral ventricle volume 
(higher NfL values were associated with larger ventricles; 
figure 2). These associations persisted after adjustment for 
age and CAG count (r=0·246, p<0·0001 for TMS, r=0·260, 
p<0·0001 for ventricular volume; appendix).
Concentrations of NfL in plasma increased sig­
nifi 
cantly from baseline in individuals with premanifest 
Huntington’s disease, by 0·060 log pg/mL per year 
(SE 0·012, p<0·0001), and in those with manifest 
Huntington’s disease, by 0·026 log pg/mL per year 
(0·0129, p=0·0442). No change was seen in controls 
(0·018 log pg/mL per year [0·0128], p=0·171). The rate of 
increase was significantly greater in HTT mutation 
carriers with premanifest Huntington’s disease than in 
controls (0·043 log pg/mL per year [0·018], p=0·0161) but 
did not differ significantly between those with premanifest 
and manifest Huntington’s disease (0·034 log pg/mL 
per year [0·018], p=0·0547) or between those with manifest 
Huntington’s disease and controls (0·009 log pg/mL 
per year [0·018], p=0·630). The greater rate of increase 
in premanifest Huntington’s disease is consistent with the 
non­linear associations between NfL concentrations, age, 
and CAG repeat count.
18 (17%) of 104 HTT mutation carriers with premanifest 
disease at baseline were newly diagnosed as having

study. The association between baseline NfL concentration 
in plasma and subsequent disease onset was significant 
(HR 3·29 per 1·0 log pg/mL, 95% CI 1·48–7·34, 
p=0·0036; figure 3), and remained so after adjustment for 
age, CAG repeat count, and their interactions (3·03 per 
1·0 log pg/mL, 1·07–8·60, p=0·0371) and for each 
baseline brain volume measure (appendix).27 A receiver 
operating characteristic curve for risk of diagnosis within 
3 years showed that mean sensitivity and specificity were 
highest when NfL concentration in plasma was 
3·61 log pg/mL at baseline (appendix), which is close to 
the median value among partici 
pants with premanifest 
Huntington’s disease at baseline of 3·69 log pg/mL.
We found significant associations between NfL con­
centration in plasma at baseline and subsequent decline 
in cognition and total functional capacity (figure 4). 
After adjustment for age and CAG repeat count, NfL 
concentration remained an independent prognostic 
factor for decline in SDMT (r=–0·173, p<0·0001) but not 
SWR (r=–0·040, p=0·4057) or UHDRS TFC (r=–0·151, 
p=0·1107). No association was found with change in 
motor score (r=0·112, p=0·0592). We found positive 
associations with atrophy of the caudate, whole­brain, 
grey matter, and white matter and with ventricular 
expansion (figure 4). These associations remained 
significant after adjustment for age and CAG repeat 
count (r=0·199, p=0·0043 for caudate, r=0·320, p<0·0001 
for whole­brain; r=0·242, p=0·019 for grey matter; 
r=0·327, p<0·0001 for white matter; and r=–0·323, 
p=0·0002 for ventricular expansion).
Diagnostic status is an obvious prognostic indicator in 
Huntington’s disease and, therefore, we additionally 
assessed whether NfL concentrations in plasma at baseline 
were associated with change in brain volumes after 
controlling for baseline diagnostic status, age, and CAG 
repeat count. We found independent associations with 
changes in whole­brain, grey­matter, and white­matter 
volumes and with ventricular expansion. Furthermore, the 
associations were independently significant in the pre­
manifest and manifest Huntington’s disease subgroups 
for whole­brain atrophy, grey­matter atrophy, and lateral 
ventricular expansion (appendix), but for all features where 
the difference between these subgroups was significant, 
the prognostic value was a stronger indicator in manifest 
than in premanifest Huntington’s disease.
The median concentration of NfL in CSF in the 
37 participants in the independent CSF cohort was 
significantly higher in HTT mutation carriers than in 
controls (1871 pg/mL, IQR 1312–2461 vs 300 pg/mL, 
234–368, figure 5), and in mutation carriers a positive 
association was seen with UHDRS TMS (r=0·4815, 
p=0·012). 
In 
matched 
plasma 
samples 
from 
30 participants, the median NfL concentration was also 
significantly higher in HTT mutation carriers than in 
controls (31·7 pg/mL, IQR 24·9–50·6 vs 9·9 pg/mL, 
8·4–13·7, figure 5), which in mutation carriers was also 
positively associated with UHDRS TMS (r=0·709, 
p<0·0001). In keeping with CNS origin, the median NfL 
concentration in CSF was 46·4 times higher than that in 
plasma. The ratio differed significantly between controls 
and HTT mutation carriers (30·1 vs 62·11, p<0·0001), but 
there was a positive association between concentrations 
in plasma and CSF (figure 5).
Discussion
In this genetically homogeneous cohort of HTT mutation 
carriers, uniquely large and well characterised among 
neurodegenerative disease cohorts, we found that NfL 
concentrations in plasma are increased compared with 
con 
trols. Additionally, concentrations increased with ad­
vancing disease—most steeply in participants with pre­
manifest Huntington’s disease at baseline—and with 
increasing CAG triplet repeat counts. The concentration at 
a given timepoint reflected the degree of motor and 
cognitive impairment as well as global and regional brain 
volumes. NfL in plasma was a prognostic indicator for 
disease onset within 3 years in participants who were 
premanifest HTT mutation carriers at baseline, inde­
pendently of previously known prognostic factors.

Further 
more, it was indicative of the likely rate of 
worsening 
of 
cognition, 
functional 
ability, 
and 
brain atrophy beyond age and CAG repeat count. We are 
unaware of other substances in blood, or for that matter in 
CSF, that have shown similarly strong prognostic power 
longitudinally and across a broad range of clinical, 
functional, and imaging mea 
sures. Our findings suggest 
that NfL concentrations in plas 
ma offer a rapid and 
accessible means of assessing and predicting neuronal 
damage in people with Huntington’s disease. 
The closer association between NfL concentrations in 
plasma and the rate of whole­brain atrophy than with the 
striatal atrophy rate suggests that this factor better reflects 
the global rate of neuronal damage. Whole­brain change is 
well described in all stages of Huntington’s disease, 
although the striatum undergoes proportionately greater 
atrophy in the early stages.5 A blood marker of neuronal 
damage across the whole brain that would be expected to 
respond to amelioration of CNS pathology would be 
extremely helpful for therapeutic development. The 
striking association we found between NfL con 
centrations 
in plasma and HTT CAG repeat count establishes a genetic 
dose–response connection in Huntington’s disease.
This study allowed assessment of the longitudinal 
prognostic power of NfL concentrations in plasma. We 
were able to analyse in detail the associations with NfL 
from before disease onset and during manifest disease 
supported by rigorous clinical, cognitive, and neuro­
imaging data. Additionally, we were able to replicate the 
principal plasma findings in an independent cohort and 
confirm that concentrations in CSF are increased in 
individuals with HTT mutations, as has been previously 
reported.8,9,15–17 We further showed that NfL concentrations 
in plasma and CSF are closely correlated, which affirms 
the likely CNS origin of the NfL detected in both biofluids 
and suggests that NfL in blood could be a reliable 
estimator of concentrations in CSF.
Our study is not without limitations. First, some of the 
cross­sectional and longitudinal correlations of NfL with 
existing outcome measures are slight, probably due to 
both biological and measurement variability. Accurate 
quantification of putaminal atrophy, for example, is 
particularly challenging. One potential advantage of 
measuring NfL is that repeated assessment is not needed 
to indicate the rate of change in the brain at a given 
timepoint. Thus, modest associations in a natural history 
study do not preclude interpretable changes in NfL 
concentrations in plasma in response to an intervention 
that ameliorates neuronal damage. Second, the analysis 
of the independent CSF cohort was not powered to 
compare the relative effect sizes of NfL concentrations in 
CSF and plasma and, therefore, we could not determine 
whether measurement in plasma is a sufficient 
alternative or whether there remains an additional value 
in quantification in CSF. Third, we do not yet have 
longitudinal data on NfL concentrations in CSF or 
predictive power of this measurement for Huntington’s 
disease progression. Fourth, TRACK­HD did not include 
participants with advanced Huntington’s disease, and 
further study is needed to understand the patterns of 
NfL concentrations across the whole disease spectrum. 
To address these issues and to enable head­to­head 
comparison of NfL with other proposed biochemical 
markers, we have recruited 80 participants in whom NfL

concentrations in CSF will be measured longitudinally, 
supported by neuroimaging,28 and have launched a 
multisite CSF study, HDClarity (NCT02855476), that will 
include 600 participants with premanifest to advanced 
Huntington’s disease and controls. Finally, we note that 
although NfL was a strong predictor of onset and 
progression overall in this study, its variability was too 
great to allow confident prediction in individuals. More­
over, the clinical relevance of any predicted changes 
cannot be inferred from this work.
Measurement of NfL concentrations in plasma yielded 
promising results as a prognostic blood biomarker 
of onset, progression, and neuronal damage in Huntington’s 
disease. We suggest that this approach has a potential role, 
once validated to regulatory standards, in facilitating 
development of novel disease­modifying therapeutics and, 
possibly, guiding treatment decisions once such treatments 
become available. We recommend that quantification of 
NfL concentrations in plasma be included in future 
observational and therapeutic trials for Huntington’s 
disease. Retrospective analysis in blood samples collected 
in previous trials might also be useful, to test for evidence 
that interventions had effects on neuronal damage, even if 
the clinical outcomes were negative.
