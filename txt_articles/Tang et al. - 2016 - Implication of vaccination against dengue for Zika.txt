Implication of vaccination against 
dengue for Zika outbreak
Biao Tang1,2, Yanni Xiao1 & Jianhong Wu2
Zika virus co-circulates with dengue in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Cases of co-infection by dengue 
and Zika have been reported, the implication of this co-infection for an integrated intervention program 
for controlling both dengue and Zika must be addressed urgently. Here, we formulate a mathematical 
model to describe the transmission dynamics of co-infection of dengue and Zika with particular focus 
on the effects of Zika outbreak by vaccination against dengue among human hosts. Our analysis 
determines specific conditions under which vaccination against dengue can significantly increase the 
Zika outbreak peak, and speed up the Zika outbreak peak timing. Our results call for further study 
about the co-infection to direct an integrated control to balance the benefits for dengue control and the 
damages of Zika outbreak.
Dengue and Zika are both vector-borne diseases in tropical and sub-tropical regions with a common vector, 
dengue and Zika both belong to the family Flaviviridae and genus Flavivirus. Dengue is a prevalent disease being 
transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected with one of the four serotypes1,2 while Zika is an emerging disease. 
Zika virus was first isolated in Uganda in 19473, and there was an outbreak of Zika in Yap, Federated States of 
Micronesia4 in 2007, and in French Polynesia5 till 2013. By the end of January 2016, autochthonous circulation 
of Zika was reported in more than 20 countries or territories in South, Central, and North America and the 
Caribbean6–12, leading to the declaration of WHO that Zika virus is a global public health emergency13.
Recent clinical and experimental evidences support immunological cross-reactivity between dengue and 
Zika14–17. In particular, these evidences show that plasma to dengue was able to drive antibody-dependent 
enhancement of Zika infection. Co-circulation of multiple serotypes of dengue and dengue-Zika co-circulation 
have previously been reported in refs 18–20. In particular, co-infection of dengue and Zika were observed in two 
patients during the Zika outbreak in New Caledonia in 201418, and in two patients during the Zika outbreak in 
Tuparetama of Brazil in 201519. The co-circulation could be a potentially series public concern given that more 
than a third of the world’s population lives in countries where dengue is endemic21, with the dengue belt cover-
ing Central America, most of South America, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and South East Asia. Relevant to this 
co-infection is the development of vaccine products against dengue by Sanofi Pasteur, and the clinical trials by 
Butantan and Takeda. Thus, it is an important urgent issue for public health decision makers to know how dengue 
immunization program impacts Zika transmission when co-circulation becomes wide spread. Specially, under 
which conditions implemented dengue immunization control programs may boost the outbreak of Zika is no 
longer a thought-provoking issue. Developing a framework to address this issue through a mathematical model 
is the main objective of this study.
Much progress has been made for modelling dengue infection dynamics including the role of cross-reactive 
antibodies for the four different dengue serotypes as discussed in the review paper22. The dengue transmission 
dynamics becomes very complex because of the co-circulating serotypes in many endemic areas, and the absence 
of long-term cross-immunity23–26. In 1997, Feng et al.27 proposed a two-stain model with the vector population 
being subdivided into a susceptible class and two serotype-specific infectious classes and the host populations 
being described by the SIR-type model for each serotype. Esteva and Vargas28 considered a further model by 
including an explicit state for individuals who recovered from primary infections. Nuraini et al.29 and Sriprom 
 
et al.30 extended Esteva’s model by accounting for two separate symptomatic and asymptomatic compartments for 
secondary infections. A four-serotype model was considered in these papers31–33. Different from these previous 
studies, recently developed mathematical models have emphasized the evaluation of the impact of co-circulation 
of the four serotypes mainly among hosts34–40. In contrast to dengue, the epidemiology of Zika among humans 
remains poorly understood, despite some recent outbreaks of modelling activities41–44.

We should mention that mathematical models of co-infection of two infectious diseases among humans have 
been developed in many different settings45, including co-infection of HIV with TB46–51, HCV52,53, two strains of 
HIV54, HDV and HBV55, multi-strains of influenza56,57. To our best knowledge, our work here is the first attempt 
to develop a mathematical model to address the co-infection of dengue and Zika and its implication to Zika prev-
alence. Our purpose here is to propose a mathematical model of co-infection of dengue and Zika with particular 
focus on the potential impact and implication for Zika outbreak of vaccination against dengue in humans.
Preliminaries
We stratify the total human population, Nh(t), into:
S(t): the number of humans susceptible to both dengue and Zika at time t;
Id(a, t): the number of dengue-infected humans with infection age a at time t, who can also be infected by Zika 
virus and move to Idz(a, b, t);

Figure 2. Sub-flow diagram of Zika infection among humans. Here, we assume that the susceptible humans 
(S) are infected by dengue with a ratio of Pd on average and by Zika with a ratio of Pz on average. We further 
assume that the class Id will be infected with Zika at a ratio of Pdz while the other part will recover to Rd. 
Moreover, we assume that the individuals in compartment Rd can be further infected with Zika at a ratio of PJ z.

Mosquito population Nm is divided into Sm, Imd, Imz, Imdz, representing the density of mosquitos who are sus-
ceptible, infected with dengue only, infected with Zika only, infected with both dengue and Zika. The transmis-
sion diagram of co-infection of dengue and Zika among humans and mosquitos is shown in Fig. 1.
We start with an intuitive view about the effects of vaccination against dengue among humans on the outbreak 
of Zika through a very simple static transmission model illustrated in Fig. 2. Here the susceptible humans (S) can 
be infected with Zika virus via three different routes, namely

Let the initial number of susceptible humans (S) be S0. If we do not inoculate against dengue, then the final aver-

Now we assume that the coverage rate of dengue vaccine is Pc and the efficacy rate of dengue vaccine is P0. Then 
the effective coverage rate of dengue vaccine is Pv =

certain conditions, vaccination against dengue can significantly boost the outbreak of Zika. Our analysis below is 
to theoretically and numerically examine these conditions with our proposed transmission dynamics model.

(dengue) while the number of Zika (dengue) infections will directly decrease to zero if Rz < 1 (Rd < 1).
Main Results
In this section, we carry out numerical simulations for the dynamic system S* in order to examine effect of dengue 
vaccination on the outbreak of Zika. In our simulations, we vary three parameters βdz, βrz and Λ

We first simulate system S* by fixing the parameters βdz and βrz as 0.18 and 0.05, respectively. We examine the 
variation of 
+
+
I
I
J
z
dz
d
z with parameter Λ 
 with or without inoculating dengue vaccine, as shown in Fig. 4. As 
we can see, when the parameter Λ 
 varies in the interval from 10000 to 1000000 vaccination against dengue can 
lead to two opposite results for the outbreak of Zika. That is, when Λ 
 is relatively low, the effect of dengue vaccine 
on the outbreak of Zika is not noticeable. However, if Λ 
 increases to relatively large, vaccination against dengue 
among humans will significantly boost the outbreak of Zika with a much higher outbreak peak compared with 
that without vaccination. The lower and upper bounds of this parameter value are determined from intensive 
numerical simulations to clearly illustrate these two opposite scenarios. In particular, we plot solutions to system 
S* (shown in Figs 5 and 6) with Λ 
 being fixed as 10000 and 1000000 (the lower and higher boundary value of the 
interval of Λ 
 chosen in Fig. 4), respectively. Figures 5(H) and 6(H) demonstrate these two opposite situations: 
dengue vaccination results in the number of human infected with Zika either decline or increase. It follows from 
Figs 5 and 6 that vaccination against dengue among humans will always reduce the number of humans infected 
with dengue (including the compartments Id, Jz
d, and Idz), and hence leads to a reduction in the total number of 
humans infected with dengue (i.e.

of individuals in the compartment Jd

nation on the Zika outbreak. Note that when Λ

significantly boost the Zika outbreak, we can calculate that Rd = Rz = 2.82, within the range of basic reproduction 
numbers for dengue and Zika in the literatures42,60–64.
Further, we examine the effects of the effective coverage rate Pv on the outbreak of Zika. Fix parameters 
βdz = 
 0.05, βrz = 
 0.18, Λ 
 = 
 10000 and let the parameter Pv vary, Fig. 7(A) shows that a higher effective coverage 
rate of vaccination can result in a much higher peak of the outbreak of Zika. Moreover, if we choose Λ 
 = 
 1000000, 
then we observe that with a higher rate of vaccination against dengue not only the peak of the outbreak of Zika 
can be significantly increased, but also the Zika outbreak peak much earlier, as shown in Fig. 7(B).
Considering the number of the accumulated Zika infections, we obtained two similar opposite results. 
Figure 7(C) shows that with a higher rate of vaccination against dengue the number of accumulated Zika infec-
tions will increase significantly, while Fig. 7(D) illustrates that vaccination against dengue may reduce the number 
of the accumulated Zika infections. In Fig. 7(D) we assumed that βrz = 
 βz = 
 0.05 while in Fig. 7(C) we assumed 
that 0.18 = 
 βrz > 
 βz = 
 0.05 based on the emerging clinical evidence of enhancement14–17. Comparisons between 
these scenarios clearly indicate, under the conditions reflected by the parameter values, that dengue vaccination 
may indeed lead to significant increase in Zika infections.
Conclusion and Discussion
There are increasing evidence of co-infection of dengue and Zika. Due to similar transmission routes with the 
same host species, some intervention strategies such as vector control are effective for curbing both dengue 
and Zika. However, other interventions such as vaccination against one virus may be harmful to the control of 
another, specially when enhancement occurs to favor the spread of the virus not covered with vaccine. Our study

examined the implication of this enhancement for Zika outbreaks when vaccination against dengue in humans 
is applied. We initially formulated a very simple static transmission model to give an intuitive illustration that 
vaccination against dengue among humans may significantly boost Zika transmission among the population.
In order to theoretically verify this illustration, we then proposed a dynamic model to describe the dynamics 
of co-infection of dengue and Zika. More specifically, we developed a novel model with double age-structures 
for dengue and Zika, extending the general age-structure model65–67 by incorporating compartments with spe-
cific dengue-infection and Zika-infection age. Under certain stage-specific homogenetical assumptions about the 
virus dynamics characteristics, we simplified our double age-structured model to an ODE model, for which the 
basic reproduction number can be calculated.
We also numerically investigated the dynamics of model S* and obtained some observations which are in 
agreement with the conclusions from the analysis of our static transmission model in Section 2. Figure 4 shows 
that vaccination against dengue among humans may result in the total number of humans infected with Zika 
virus decline or increase, depending on the parameter Λ 
, the recruitment rate of mosquitos. In particular, it sig-
nificantly enlarges the peak of the outbreak of Zika when Λ 
 is relatively large. It follows from Figs 5 and 6 that this 
enlarged outbreak of Zika by vaccination against dengue is due to multiple factors. Vaccination against dengue 
can reduce the numbers of Iz and Idz while it always increases the number of Jd
z. Thus the balance of increase in the 
number of Jd
z and decrease in the number of Iz and Idz determines whether the total number of infected with Zika 
increase or not. Further, we observed that a higher rate of vaccination against dengue can also results in a higher 
and earlier peak of the outbreak of Zika, as shown in Fig. 7(A,B). Comparing Fig. 7(B) with Fig. 7(A), we observe 
that the conclusion that vaccination against dengue can boost Zika outbreak remains true for a wide range of 
mosquito index values (when the recruitment rate of mosquito decreases from 1000000 to 10000). This conclu-
sion is also shown in Fig. S2 (electronic supplementary information) when the mosquito mortality rate μm varies. 
Comparison between Fig. 7(B) and Fig. 7(A) however also shows that reducing the mosquito indices can signifi-
cantly decrease the magnitude of Zika outbreak as the number of Zika cases at the peak time can be reduced 
substantially. Therefore, given the simultaneous impact on both dengue and Zika outbreaks, vector control should

be always implemented regardless of the availability of vaccine. Figure 7(C,D) further confirm that the accumu-
lated Zika infections may be greater for a greater rate of vaccination of dengue vaccine to human. Sensitive anal-
yses show that parameters βz, βdz, Λ 
 and μm can significantly affect the outbreak of Zika, in terms of both the 
accumulated Zika infections and the daily number of Zika infections (see electronic supplementary information 
for details).
Most existing studies on the multi-serotype models of vector-host transmission of dengue focus on the impor-
tance of subsequent infections with different dengue serotypes. It was assumed that the patients can be subse-
quently infected by another serotypes after recovering from one serotype. In our consideration of dengue-Zika 
co-infection, we extended these models by adding a new compartment of humans as well as mosquitos infected 
by both of Zika and dengue simultaneously. From our numerical analysis, the parameter βdz (i.e. the transmission 
rate of the compartment of mosquitos infected with dengue and Zika to susceptible humans), which is related to 
the newly added compartment Imdz, can have important influences on the dynamics of the co-infection model. 
For the models of co-infection of HIV with TB and HCV, a SI-type model is usually assumed as the basic model 
for each disease. In comparison with these models, our model with SIR-type for humans is different to handle 
the asymmetric vector-host interaction as discussed in ref. 27, and to allow recovered (or vaccinated) individuals 
from one virus to have higher risk of infection by another. Our analysis indicates that with a big recruitment rate 
of mosquitos Λ 
 vaccination against dengue among humans can significantly boost the Zika outbreak (as shown 
in Fig. 6(H)), and cause the Zika outbreak peak coming early with a bigger mosquito to humans transmission rate 
βrz and lower βdz (as shown in Fig. 7(B)). It is important to note that a safe, effective and affordable dengue vaccine 
against the four strains offers an important tool to reach the WHO goal of reducing dengue morbidity by at least 
25% and mortality by at least 50% by 202068. The first dengue vaccine, Dengvaxiar(CYD-TDV) (developed by 
Sanofi Pasteur), was licensed in Mexico in 201569; and two dengue vaccine candidates (developed by Butantan 
and Takeda) entered the Phase III trails in early 201670–72. Our study should not serve as a discouragement to 
the development of these dengue vaccine products, but rather we determine conditions under which dengue 
vaccination can contribute to the prevention and control of dengue without inducing significant increase in Zika 
infection.
Most published works focus on the benefits of the control strategies (such as treatments for only one or both 
diseases) to both diseases involved in the co-infection. For example, Derouich and Boutayeb73 considered a model 
of two subsequent infections of dengue at separate time intervals with continuous vaccination. They concluded 
that vaccination can be a control strategy for dengue. However, with consideration of co-infection and the current 
development of dengue vaccine, our results suggest that additional study on co-infection is urgently and critically 
needed.
