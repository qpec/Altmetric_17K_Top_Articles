Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation has been proposed as (adjuvant) treatment for major depressive
disorder (MDD). In the present meta-analysis, we pooled randomized placebo-controlled trials assessing the effects of
omega-3 PUFA supplementation on depressive symptoms in MDD. Moreover, we performed meta-regression to test whether
supplementation effects depended on eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid dose, their ratio, study duration,
participants’ age, percentage antidepressant users, baseline MDD symptom severity, publication year and study quality. To limit
heterogeneity, we only included studies in adult patients with MDD assessed using standardized clinical interviews, and excluded
studies that specifically studied perinatal/perimenopausal or comorbid MDD. Our PubMED/EMBASE search resulted in 1955 articles,
from which we included 13 studies providing 1233 participants. After taking potential publication bias into account, meta-analysis
showed an overall beneficial effect of omega-3 PUFAs on depressive symptoms in MDD (standardized mean difference = 0.398
(0.114–0.682), P = 0.006, random-effects model). As an explanation for significant heterogeneity (I2 = 73.36, Po0.001),
meta-regression showed that higher EPA dose (β = 0.00037 (0.00009–0.00065), P = 0.009), higher percentage antidepressant users
(β = 0.0058 (0.00017–0.01144), P = 0.044) and earlier publication year (β = − 0.0735 (−0.143 to 0.004), P = 0.04) were significantly
associated with better outcome for PUFA supplementation. Additional sensitivity analyses were performed. In conclusion, present
meta-analysis suggested a beneficial overall effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation in MDD patients, especially for higher doses
of EPA and in participants taking antidepressants. Future precision medicine trials should establish whether possible interactions
between EPA and antidepressants could provide targets to improve antidepressant response and its prediction. Furthermore,
potential long-term biochemical side effects of high-dosed add-on EPA supplementation should be carefully monitored.

INTRODUCTION
Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been proposed
as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Over the last
decade, several meta-analyses have been performed, which
suggested variable degrees of beneficial effects of omega-3
PUFAs for MDD, but made critical remarks regarding the quality of
the evidence and possible publication bias.1–6 These meta-
analyses evoked academic correspondence, discussing the used
inclusion criteria and selection of outcome measures.7,8 In brief,
this correspondence suggested beneficial effects (1) if a higher
ratio of omega-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to docosahex-
aenoic acid (DHA) was being supplemented7 and (2) only in
patients with actual MDD as opposed to subjects with merely
depressive symptoms.8
Of these meta-analyses, only the three most recent meta-
analyses covered the research performed over the last 5 years: (1)
Grosso et al.9 included randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
published up to August 2013, and concluded that omega-3
PUFAs were effective in depressive patients with or without an
MDD diagnosis; (2) Yang et al.10 pooled RCTs published up to
March 2015 on the effect of the combination of EPA and DHA on
depression in women and observed a beneficial effect; and (3)
Appleton et al.4 performed a Cochrane meta-analysis of RCTs
published up to May 2015, concluding that there is a small-to-
modest, non-clinically beneficial effect of omega-3 PUFAs.
Importantly, these meta-analyses seem to have several issues of
interest. First, they did not correct for potential publication bias,
for example, by using the trim-and-fill method.11 Second, Grosso
et al. included two comparisons of the study of Jazayeri et al.12
This study had three arms using a double-dummy technique (EPA
+placebo vs EPA+fluoxetine vs fluoxetine+placebo). Although
other meta-analyses only included the fluoxetine+EPA vs fluox-
etine+placebo comparison (that is, EPA vs placebo in an add-on
design), Grosso et al. additionally included the EPA+placebo vs
fluoxetine+placebo comparison (that is, EPA vs fluoxetine during
additional placebo treatment). Thereby, Grosso et al. not only
compared EPA vs placebo, but additionally included a comparison
of EPA vs active antidepressant medication, potentially reducing
the overall effect size. Third, Grosso et al. and Yang et al. included
three articles that all seem to report on the same RCT,13–15 that
is, (partial) duplicate publication which distorts pooled-effect

 estimates. Fourth, Grosso et al. and Appleton et al. missed
potentially important evidence by not including all RCTs on MDD
patients in their analysis (for example, Lesperance et al.16 in Grosso
et al.; and Mozaffari-Khosravi et al.17 in Appleton et al.). Although
the study of Mozaffari-Khosravi et al. included mild-to-moderate
MDD patients, all patients fulfilled MDD criteria, baseline severity
was comparable to other included studies and other included
studies (for example, Lucas et al.18) also used an upper limit for
MDD severity. Fifth, all three meta-analyses only used post-
intervention effect size data, while repeated measures are
available, which may improve effect size estimation precision.
Sixth, by including RCTs that not only included MDD patients but
also patients with dysthymia,13,14 all three meta-analyses did not
specifically focus on MDD only. In addition, Appleton et al.
included the trial by Peet and Horrobin19 that did not use MDD
diagnosis as an inclusion criterion, but rather a cutoff score on a
depression symptom questionnaire. Moreover, Appleton et al. and
Grosso et al. also included trials on subjects with MDD secondary
to neurological or other somatic disorders (for example, Da Silva
et al.),20 which may increase heterogeneity due to different
underlying pathophysiology.
Therefore, our study aims at continuing the academic debate by
performing a revised updated meta-analysis on the effectiveness
of omega-3 PUFAs for the treatment of MDD taking into account
the above issues of concern. In addition, we performed meta-
regression analyses to explain expected heterogeneity, by testing
the effects of EPA and DHA dose and their ratio, study duration,
participants’ age, percentage antidepressant users, baseline MDD
symptom severity, publication year and study quality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Search strategy
We performed a search in the Medline and Embase databases (from
inception up to 8 December 2015). We used a search strategy combining
terms regarding MDD and fatty acid supplementation using Boolean
operators
(See
Supplementary
Methods).
We
additionally
searched
references of selected studies and earlier meta-analyses for potential
studies.1,4,9
Study selection
Two independent reviewers (RJTM and IH/JA) screened the identified
articles for their relevance by title and abstract, and—if necessary—the full
text. In case of disagreement between reviewers, inclusion could be
conclusively determined by discussion in all the cases. A priori criteria for
inclusion of studies were: (1) design was a randomized placebo-controlled
trial; (2) inclusion of adult patients with MDD according to the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) as assessed by a
standardized clinical interview. We excluded studies that (1) specifically
studied perinatal or perimenopausal MDD or (2) MDD secondary to other
neuropsychiatric disorders.
With these in- and exclusion criteria, we aimed to test the effect
of
omega-3
fatty
acid
supplementation
on
depressive
symptoms
specifically in MDD, as opposed to depressive symptoms in the general
population
(including
subclinical
depression).
Because
previous
meta-analyses
included
clinically
more
heterogeneous
populations
which theoretically may preclude meta-analysis, we aimed to prevent
inclusion of trials where supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids could
improve an underlying somatic or (neuro)psychiatric disorder, with a
secondary effect on the depression scores. In addition, by excluding
specific subgroups like perinatal or perimenopausal MDD, with a
potentially different pathophysiology, we aimed to further minimize
heterogeneity among included studies. Because of the widespread
comorbidity between MDD and cardiovascular disease, we did not exclude
studies that specifically studied MDD with comorbid cardiovascular disease
or diabetes.21 Nevertheless, we performed sensitivity analyses without the
studies that specifically studied MDD with comorbid cardiovascular disease
or diabetes.22,23
Critical appraisal
We assessed the quality of the studies that were selected with the in- and
exclusion criteria above using the Jadad scale for reporting RCTs.24
Data extraction
Two independent reviewers (RJTM and IH) extracted the data into
specifically designed spreadsheets. We collected the data on descriptives,
methods and outcomes. Possible disagreements were resolved by
discussion with a third independent reviewer where necessary (JA).
We used the primary outcome measure reported by the study. We used
the unadjusted intention-to-treat repeated-measures statistics where
available. If multiple primary outcomes were reported, we used the
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS).25 If unavailable, we used
another clinician-rated outcome. If unavailable, we used a self-rated
depression scale. We performed sensitivity analyses using unpublished
additional data derived from the authors where available.4,12,26,27
Statistical analysis
We performed the statistical analyses with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis
version 2. We used standardized mean differences as the summary statistic
for meta-analysis. We assessed heterogeneity by calculating the I2
statistic.11 Given the expected heterogeneity, we a priori used a random-
effects model.11 We performed the sensitivity analyses using fixed-effects
models because they are considered to be less vulnerable for publication
bias. We assessed publication bias by plotting a funnel plot, and reporting
the classic and Orwin’s fail-safe N, Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation
and Egger’s regression intercept.11 Finally, we adjusted the values using
the Duval and Tweedie’s trim-and-fill method.
We performed meta-regression using the method of moments compu-
tational option.11 We a priori planned to test the univariate effects of EPA
and DHA dose, study duration, participants’ age, percentage antidepres-
sant users, baseline MDD severity, publication year and study quality, on
the effect size of trials. To compare EPA- and DHA-dose effects for studies
where multiple subgroups were available, we regarded these subgroups as
independent, assuming independence where necessary.11 For baseline
severity, we converted scores to the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating
Scales using available conversion tables where needed.28,29
RESULTS
Selection of studies
The search strategy resulted in 1955 articles for consideration in
the present meta-analysis. The studies were excluded for several
reasons, including not applying a randomized placebo-controlled
trial design, no inclusion of subjects with MDD as ascertained by a
structured clinical interview,30–33 or specifically including patients
with perinatal or perimenopausal MDD, or MDD secondary to
other neuropsychiatric disorders20,34 (Supplementary Figure S1).
After applying the in- and exclusion criteria, we included 15
studies,12,16–18,22,23,26,35–42 including a total of 1253 MDD subjects.
Study-characteristics are provided in Supplementary Table 1. Of
these 15 studies, 1 small preliminary study reports unpublished
data (Coryell et al., related to Fiedorowicz et al.42), and 1 small
study has a considerable drop-out rate (450%).41 Given the
relatively preliminary nature of these two studies, we included
them only in separate sensitivity analyses.

 difference in means as 0.1 and mean standardized difference in
means in missing studies as 0. This implied that at least 19 studies
without any effect must have been left unpublished to reduce the
overall effect to a trivial effect. Regarding the Begg and Mazumbar
rank-correlation test, Kendall’s taus with and without continuity
correction were 0.21 (P2-sided = 0.28), and 0.22 (P2-sided = 0.26),
respectively, indicative of no publication bias. Egger’s regression
intercept was 1.13 (95% confidence interval: − 0.63 to 2.91; P2-
sided = 0.19), also suggesting no significant publication bias. Duval
and Tweedie’s trim-and-fill method used the random-effects
model looking for missing studies to the left of the mean, that
is, less positive effect of supplementation, and showed that no
studies needed to be trimmed. See Supplementary Results for
sensitivity analyses.

DISCUSSION
Our revised updated meta-analysis adds nuance to the continuing
debate on the effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on
depressive symptoms in MDD. By addressing several issues as
noted in the introduction, the present meta-analysis studied
effects
of omega-3
PUFA
supplementation
in all available
evidence in a specific relatively homogeneous group of MDD
subjects. Overall, with an standardized mean difference of 0.398
present meta-analysis shows a beneficial effect of omega-3 PUFAs
that is comparable to effects reported in meta-analyses of
antidepressants.43 Of note, this effect seemed larger in studies
(1) supplementing higher doses of EPA and (2) performed in
patients using antidepressants (augmentation/add-on), while it
was independent of baseline depression severity or EPA/(EPA
+DHA) ratio. However, more recent trials had smaller effect sizes,
independent of trial quality.
By including a relatively homogeneous group of patients with
MDD according to DSM criteria as assessed using a standardized
clinical interview, we aimed to enhance internal validity and
generalizability of the present meta-analysis. Nevertheless, the
included MDD patients still form a heterogeneous group including
both subjects that will benefit from omega-3 PUFA supplementa-
tion and those that experience no or even negative effects.21
Several other unreported factors may influence the response to
omega-3 PUFA, which could not be tested in the present meta-
analysis and meta-regression, for example, measurements of
inflammation or nutrigenetics.44–47
Nevertheless, we were able to test sample and trial-related
factors that may influence omega-3 PUFA response. In the present
meta-analysis, response was independent of baseline MDD
symptom severity. This may be because we included a relatively
homogeneous sample of MDD patients in comparison with earlier
meta-analyses
that
also
included
subjects
with
depressive
symptoms.1 In contrast to the lack of effect of baseline severity,
we noticed that the effects of supplementation seemed larger in
patients being treated with antidepressants compared with
patients not being concurrently treated with antidepressants. Of
note, MDD baseline severity was not associated with percentage
antidepressant use across trials (P = 0.778). Therefore, this larger
effect in trials where patients were being treated with antide-
pressants suggests an interaction between antidepressant use and
omega-3 PUFAs at the biological level, for example, due to PUFAs’
modulating effect on neuronal membrane–antidepressant inter-
actions or on inflammatory pathways.21,45,48,49 In addition, omega-
3 PUFAs may interfere with serotonergic neurotransmission,50 or
antidepressant
transport
across
the
blood–brain
barrier
by
influencing p-glycoprotein.51 It could be highly clinically relevant
to follow up on this finding that omega-3 PUFAs seem to have
more effect in studies where participants use antidepressants,
by further investigating the interaction between omega-3 PUFAs

 and antidepressants from (integrated) biological and clinical
perspectives.
The present meta-regression finding that higher EPA dose was
associated with better response, nuances an earlier meta-analysis
that observed significant effects after applying a dichotomous
cutoff at 60% EPA content.7 First, although it remained relatively
unclear how this previous cutoff was derived, our regression
model suggested a linear relationship in all the available data
without using an artificial cutoff. In addition, the present meta-
analysis also showed that EPA/(EPA+DHA) ratio had no significant
effect, nor had DHA dose. Altogether, this suggests that it is not
the ratio of EPA vs DHA that is important, but rather the higher
EPA dose. Although hypothesized, it does not seem that DHA
counteracts the effects of EPA (for example, by competition for
target proteins or membrane incorporation);6,52,53 DHA simply has
no detectable pooled effect on the MDD symptoms. Nevertheless,
it remains surprising that EPA seems to be responsible for the
beneficial effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation while DHA
concentrations appear to differ more between patients and
controls.54 In addition, the regression effect of EPA dose on RCT
outcome depended to some extent on one trial that supplemen-
ted the highest EPA concentration.26 On the basis of these
findings, it could be argued that the beneficial effects of omega-3
PUFA supplementation are not because supplementation corrects
a membrane DHA ‘deficit’, but rather due to the anti-inflammatory
characteristics of EPA’s oxidation products.21 Future mechanistic
studies in a more continuous dose range should follow up on
these findings.
However, these oxidation products may not have positive
effects only. Relatively little is known about the precise role and
effect of the great diversity of PUFA oxidation products. Although
adverse events reported during the studies were usually mild and
gastrointestinal in nature (for example, belching, constipation,
fishy aftertaste), exposure to PUFA oxidation products with
unknown
effects
may
pose
unknown
risks
in
the
long
term.21,47,55 It may therefore be advisable to measure these
oxidation products during future studies with a longer follow-up
to obtain more insight in their potential toxicity. In addition, fishy
aftertaste may result in unblinding, potentially distorting effect
sizes.4,56
The finding that more recent studies showed smaller effects
remains puzzling. It seems independent from study quality, as we
observed no association between study effect size and study
quality operationalized as Jadad score. It may be that differences
in background diet over time contributed to smaller effects of
additional omega-3 PUFA supplementation. For example, even
though studies usually excluded participants that used omega-3
PUFA supplements on their own initiative at baseline, it may be
that participants started using omega-3 PUFA supplements during
the study owing to their increasing popularity, thereby diminish-
ing outcome differences in more recent trials. Unfortunately, not
enough trials provided uniform data regarding baseline omega-3
PUFA status or intake to formally test this,57 which would be
interesting in future research.
Limitations and strengths
Despite several strengths of this meta-analysis, some limitations
should be noted. First, the present meta-analysis has not been
performed on patient level data. It would be interesting to confirm
these findings on a patient level. Moreover, this may also lead to
additional predictors of supplementation outcome, giving rise to
extra targets for future precision medicine studies. We hope
researchers will be motivated to share and pool available data in
the future. Furthermore, while the present meta-analysis had
enough power to detect small-to-medium effect sizes, smaller
regression effects may have been lost as a result of the smaller
number of studies due to the specific in- and exclusion criteria. In
addition, several concerns regarding the quality of the available
evidence could be made,4 like in most meta-analyses. Further
high-quality evidence to support a beneficial effect of EPA in
(antidepressant using) MDD patients could lead to more precise
estimates of overall effect size. Finally, to maintain power for the
meta-regression regarding the effect of percentage antidepres-
sant users on supplementation outcome, we pooled all concurrent
antidepressant classes together, while the effects may differ per
class. It would be interesting to further test this in future studies
including users of different antidepressants.
Nonetheless, the present study/analyses focused on studies that
specifically included patients with MDD according to diagnostic
criteria as ascertained with a structured clinical interview. We thus
limited clinical heterogeneity while still maintaining a substantial
overall sample size. As a second strength, by performing extensive
nuanced a priori planned publication bias analyses and meta-
regression analyses, we revealed new evidence for (1) an effect of
EPA dose as opposed to EPA to DHA ratio and (2) an interaction
between omega-3 PUFAs and antidepressants, both of which may
be highly relevant for clinical practice.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the present meta-analysis observed a beneficial
overall effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation in patients with
MDD according to diagnostic criteria, which seemed larger in
studies that supplemented higher doses of EPA and included
patients taking antidepressants. Future precision/personalized
medicine trials should establish whether possible interactions
between
EPA
and
antidepressants
could
provide
targets
to
improve
antidepressant
response
and
its
prediction.48
Nevertheless, potential long-term biochemical side effects of
high-dosed add-on EPA supplementation should be carefully
monitored.21
