Abstract
Background: Amphiregulin (AREG) is an epidermal growth factor that is a significant mediator of tissue repair at
mucosal sites, including in the lungs during influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Previous research illustrates that males
of reproductive ages experience less severe disease and recover faster than females following infection with IAV.
Methods: Whether males and females differentially produce and utilize AREG for pulmonary repair after IAV infection
was investigated using murine models on a C57BL/6 background and primary mouse and human epithelial cell culture
systems.
Results: Following sublethal infection with 2009 H1N1 IAV, adult female mice experienced greater morbidity and
pulmonary inflammation during the acute phase of infection as well as worse pulmonary function during the
recovery phase of infection than males, despite having similar virus clearance kinetics. As compared with females, AREG
expression was greater in the lungs of male mice as well as in primary respiratory epithelial cells derived from mouse and
human male donors, in response to H1N1 IAVs. Internalization of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was also
greater in respiratory epithelial cells derived from male than female mice. IAV infection of Areg knock-out (Areg−/−) mice
eliminated sex differences in IAV pathogenesis, with a more significant role for AREG in infection of male compared to
female mice. Deletion of Areg had no effect on virus replication kinetics in either sex. Gonadectomy and treatment of
either wild-type or Areg−/− males with testosterone improved the outcome of IAV as compared with their placebo-treated
conspecifics.
Conclusions: Taken together, these data show that elevated levels of testosterone and AREG, either independently or in
combination, improve resilience (i.e., repair and recovery of damaged tissue) and contribute to better influenza outcomes
in males compared with females.

 Background
Sex differences are reported in the severity and out-
comes of many pulmonary diseases. For example, after
puberty and into adulthood, human females are at
greater
risk
of
developing
allergy-induced
asthma,
chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease (even among non-smokers), and have more severe
cystic fibrosis than their male counterparts [1]. In adult
mice, pulmonary infection with Psudomonas aeruginosa
causes a worse outcome in females than males, with fe-
males exhibiting a higher bacterial burden, greater in-
flammation, and higher concentrations of TNF-α than
males [2]. In contrast, respiratory diseases caused by infec-
tion with either Streptococcus pneumonia or Bacillus
anthracis results in a worse outcome in adult male com-
pared with female mice, with males having greater bacter-
ial burden and inflammation in their lungs [2, 3]. There is
also evidence that hospitalization rates and severity of dis-
ease following infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis
are greater for human males than females, but the contri-
butions of biological sex versus gender-associated factors
are debated [4–6]. In most cases of infectious or inflam-
matory diseases in the respiratory tract, the etiology of the
sex-specific differences in disease outcome is not known.
We have studied the complexities of sex differences in
pulmonary inflammation in the context of influenza
pathogenesis using small animal models and primary cell
cultures derived from humans and mice [7–12]. Using
murine models, others and we have shown that females
develop higher pulmonary inflammatory responses and
experience a more severe outcome from influenza A
virus (IAV) infection than males, despite the sexes hav-
ing comparable virus titers [7, 8, 13–15]. Acute infection
with IAVs causes clinical illness in male and female mice,
leading to a transient reduction in testosterone during the
acute phase of infection [12] and a more persistent reduc-
tion in circulating estradiol and progesterone, with a loss
of reproductive function in females [7]. In males, testoster-
one protects and castration exacerbates pulmonary in-
flammation during IAV infection, without affecting virus
titers [12]. Treatment with either estradiol or progesterone
protects females against infection-induced morbidity and
mortality from IAV infection [7, 9, 11, 16, 17]. Treatment
of female mice with estradiol appears to protect against
IAV infection by dampening the inflammatory responses
associated with tissue damage and promoting higher anti-
body responses to influenza vaccination [7, 9, 16, 17]. Pro-
gesterone, on the other hand, promotes repair of damaged
tissue following IAV infection, including production of the
epidermal
growth
factor-like
molecule,
amphiregulin
(AREG) [11].
Repair of the damaged lung tissue following IAV infec-
tion is generally orchestrated by both immune cells (e.g.,
regulatory T cells and macrophages) and epithelial cells
and involves the production of cytokines and growth fac-
tors [18, 19]. In response to damage, epithelial cells re-
lease factors, including AREG, that can promote repair
and integrity of lung tissue damaged during IAV infec-
tion [20]. AREG is not only predominantly expressed in
epithelial cells but also can be expressed in activated im-
mune cells [21]. AREG is constitutively expressed during
development and in homeostatic states but increases
dramatically in response to inflammation or infection.
The effects of AREG are mediated by its low affinity bind-
ing to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [22].
The unique activation of EGFR by AREG is hypothesized
to aid in tissue repair through differentiation and prolifer-
ation of tissue resident cells, such as epithelial cells, which
express EGFR [23]. Whether there are sex-dependent dif-
ferences in AREG responses, however, has not been re-
ported because studies either use only female mice or do
not report the sex of the mice [20, 24–29]. Because males
recover from IAV infection faster than females, we hy-
pothesized that production of AREG and subsequent re-
pair of damaged pulmonary tissue may be greater in males
than in females and may be dependent on testosterone.
Methods
Animals
Adult (7–9 weeks old) male and female C57BL/6 mice
were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Fred-
erick, MD). Areg+/− (C57BL/6 129 Sv) mice were kindly
provided by Dr. Marco Conti (University of California
San Francisco) and bred to obtain Areg−/− and Areg+/+
littermates. Mice were housed five per microisolator
cages under standard BSL-2 housing condition with food
and water ad libitum. All animal procedures were ap-
proved by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care
and Use Committee under animal protocol M015H236.
Cell cultures
Primary human alveolar epithelial cells (type I-like pneu-
mocytes) were isolated from non-malignant human lung
tissues as previously described [30]. Briefly, human lung tis-
sues were cut into pieces of < 0.5 cm and digested with
0.5% trypsin (Gibco, Invitrogen) and 4 U/ml elastase
(Worthington Biochemical Corp). After digestion was fin-
ished, the macrophages were depleted from the cell suspen-
sion using CD14 antibodies and the remaining epithelial
cells were cultured in a tissue culture flask using supple-
mented small airway basal medium (SABM) (Lonza).
Primary differentiated murine tracheal epithelial cell
(mTEC) culture conditions and media were generated as
previously described [11, 31]. Briefly, epithelial progeni-
tor cells isolated from tracheal tissue were grown in
collagen-coated 24-well Transwell inserts until a consist-
ent high transelectrical reading (TER) was reached. The
cultures were then exposed to an air-liquid interface by

 removing the apical media and incubated at 37 °C for
12–14 days before use.
Virus infection, quantification, and purification
For
animal
studies,
mice
were
infected
with
the
mouse-adapted influenza A virus, A/California/04/09
(ma2009; H1N1) generated by Dr. Andrew Pekosz from
a published sequence [32]. For the infections, mice were
anesthetized with a ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine
(8 mg/kg) cocktail and inoculated intranasally with 30 μl
of a low dose of ma2009 virus (0.04 mouse lethal dose
[MLD50]) or mock-infected with DMEM alone. Mice
were monitored daily for changes in body mass and rec-
tal temperature.
For virus quantification in the lungs, the 50% tissue
culture
infectious
dose
(TCID50)
was
determined.
Ten-fold serial dilutions of lung homogenates were
plated onto monolayers of Madin-Darby canine kidney
(MDCK) cells in replicates of 6 for 6 days at 32 °C. Cells
were stained with naphthol blue black (Sigma Aldrich)
and scored for cytopathic effects. The TCID50 titer was
calculated according to the Reed-Muench method.
For mTEC culture infections [33, 34], the apical sur-
face was washed twice with PBS, followed by incubation
with approximately 3 × 107 TCID50 units of 2009 H1N1
diluted in 100 μl DMEM media for 1 h at 37 °C, result-
ing in a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of approximately
10 infectious units per cell. The inoculum was removed,
the apical surface washed three times with PBS, and the
cells were incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated times
post-infection, 150 μl of DMEM was added to the apical
surface and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min.
The apical wash and the basolateral media were then re-
moved and stored at − 70 °C. The basolateral media was
replaced with
fresh
media,
and the
cultures were
returned to 37 °C. Infectious virus titers in the apical
supernatant were determined by TCID50 assay.
For human cell culture studies, the IAV used was a
seasonal H1N1 virus, A/Hong Kong/54/98, isolated from
humans and passaged in MDCK cells. Virus titer was
determined by using a TCID50 assay in MDCK cells in
the presence of 1 μg/ml of tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl-
chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma).
Primary human alveolar epithelial cells were infected
with H1N1 IAV at an MOI of 2. The virus inoculum was
removed after 1 h of virus incubation at 37 °C and 5%
CO2. The cells were then washed with PBS and replen-
ished with culture medium.
Gonadectomy and testosterone administration
Young adult male mice were anesthetized with keta-
mine/xylazine cocktail and bilaterally gonadectomized as
previously described [7, 8, 12]. All animals were given
2 weeks to recover from surgery prior to testosterone
treatment. Testosterone was administered by subcutane-
ously implanting a silicone capsule (0.040 mm in inner
diameter, 0.085 mm in outer diameter, 7.5 mm length)
containing
100%
crystalline
testosterone
propionate
(Sigma) between the scapulae. The capsules were equili-
brated in sterile physiological saline for 12 h at 37 °C
prior to implantation. Animals in the placebo group re-
ceived implants of empty capsules. All males were
treated with testosterone for 1 week prior to infection.
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry in lung
sections
Lungs were inflated at constant pressure of 25 cmH20,
fixed in zinc-buffered formalin (Z-fix, Anatech). Tissues
were embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 μm sections, and
mounted on glass slides. Slides were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and used to evaluate lung
inflammation. Histopathological scoring was performed
by a single blinded observer using a 0–3 scale (0, no in-
flammation; 1, mild inflammation; 2, moderate inflam-
mation; and 3, severe inflammation) for the following
parameters: bronchiolitis, alveolitis, vasculitis, perivascu-
litis, necrosis, consolidation, and edema [11]. The sum
of these parameters represents the cumulative inflamma-
tion score. The percentage of lesioned areas within each
tissue section was evaluated using ImageJ software [12].
For immunofluorescence staining, slides were deparafi-
nized with xylene and rehydrated in graded ethanol.
Heat-induced antigen retrieval with citrate buffer was
performed, and slides were blocked with 3% normal don-
key serum with 0.5% BSA prior to overnight incubation
with
anti-AREG
mouse
(R&D)
and
monoclonal
anti-β-tubulin IV (BioGenex) antibodies. Slides were then
washed in PBS + 0.05% Tween-20 and stained with sec-
ondary AF555-linked donkey anti-goat (ThermoFisher)
for AREG and AF488-linked donkey anti-mouse (Ther-
moFisher) for β-tubulin. Slides were then treated against
autofluorescence using 0.3% Sudan Black B (Sigma) di-
luted in 70% ethanol and mounted using anti-fade
medium containing DAPI (ProLong Gold from Cell Sig-
naling Techonology). Images were taken using a Nikon
Eclipse E800 (for H&E) or a Zeiss AxioImager M2 (for im-
munofluorescence) and analyzed using ImageJ (NIH).
mTEC culture immunofluorescence and confocal
microscopy
The mTEC cultures were harvested at 18 hpi. The cul-
tures were washed twice in cold PBS, fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, and washed twice
in cold PBS. Fixed cells were then permeabilized in 0.2%
Triton-X100 (Sigma) for 10 min before being washed,
blocked in PBS with 2% donkey serum and 0.5% BSA
(blocking solution), stained with monoclonal anti-HA
mouse antibody (BEI Resources NR-42021; diluted 1:100

 in blocking solution) and polyclonal anti-EGFR rabbit
antibody (ThermoFisher PA1–1110; diluted 1:200 in
blocking solution) followed by secondary AF488-linked
donkey anti-rabbit antibody and AF555-linked donkey
anti-mouse antibody (both diluted 1:500 in blocking so-
lution). Cells were washed after each step by dipping
membrane sections in PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20
12 times. Cells were washed a final time in MilliQ water
before mounting in Prolong gold antifade with DAPI
(ThermoFisher). Cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM
700 microscopy with Zen software for image acquisition.
Images were taken with a × 63 objective in Z-stack mode
with 0.5 μm optical sections. Images were analyzed and
processed for publication with Volocity and FIJI.
Real-time reverse-transcription PCR
Snap-frozen lung tissues or mTECs were homogenized in
TRIzol, and RNA was purified by chloroform extraction.
RNA concentration and purity was measured using a
NanoDrop (ThermoFisher Scientific). The RNA concentra-
tion in each sample was standardized to 1 μg using
RNAse-free water. Reverse transcription was carried out
using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Biorad) according to
the
manufacturer’s
protocol.
Pre-designed
Areg
(Mm.PT58.31037760) and Gapdh (Mm.PT.39a.1) Prime-
Time Primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Tech-
nologies. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed in
96-well optical reaction plates using the SsoFast EvaGreen
Supermix (Biorad) on the StepOnePlus RT-PCR system
(Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was normalized to
Gapdh (ΔCt) and/or mock-infected samples (ΔΔCt).
For human cells, 24-h post-infection, total RNA of the al-
veolar epithelial cell lysates was extracted using the RNeasy
Mini Kit (Takara Bio Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. cDNA was produced using the PrimeScript RT
Reagent Kit (Takara Bio Inc.) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. The mRNA expression of target genes was
accessed by SYBR Premix Ex Taq II kit (Takara Bio Inc.) ac-
cording to the manufacturer’s instructions and quantified
using ABI ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosys-
tems). The cycle threshold (Ct) values or amplification
curves data were converted to the relative gene copy num-
ber, and each target gene expression was normalized to the
housekeeping beta-actin gene expression. Primer sequences
for detection of influenza virus matrix gene (M gene) and
beta-actin were described previously [30]. Human amp-
hiregulin gene forward primer 3′-ACCTACTCTGGGAA
GCGTGA-5′ and reverse primer 3′-AGCCAGGTATTT
GTGGTTCG-5′ were used. Gene expression was normal-
ized to Gapdh and mock-infected samples (ΔΔCt).
Pulmonary function phenotyping
Pulmonary function analyses were performed 14 days
post-infection (dpi). Respiratory rate, tidal volume, and
minute
ventilation
were
determined
by
barometric
whole-body plethysmography performed on unanesthe-
tized mice, as previously described [35]. Mice were then
anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine cocktail (100 mg/
kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively), and a tracheotomy was
performed for cannulation with an 18-g stub needle.
0.8 ml of a gas mixture containing 0.3% neon, 0.3% CO
in room air was quickly injected through the cannula
into the lungs, held for 9 s, then quickly withdrawn for
measurement of lung diffusion capacity (DFCO) by gas
chromatography (Inficon, Micro GC model 3000A), as
previously described [36]. The DFCO for each mouse was
calculated as 1 − (CO9/COc)/(Ne9/Nec) (c = calibration
gas, 9 = gas from the 9s exhaled sample). Following
measurement of DFCO, mice were mechanically venti-
lated with 100% oxygen using a Flexivent system (Scireq)
at a rate of 150 breaths/min and a tidal volume of
10 ml/kg with a PEEP of 3 cm H2O. Respiratory resist-
ance (Rrs) and compliance (Crs) were measured 1 min
following a deep inspiration to 30 cmH2O.
Statistical analyses
Morbidity data were analyzed with MANOVAs followed
by planned comparisons. Virus titers, amphiregulin,
histopathological, and pulmonary function data were an-
alyzed using two-way ANOVAs or t tests, and significant
interactions were further analyzed using the Bonferroni
method for pairwise multiple comparisons. Mean differ-
ences were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05.
Results
Females recover slower than males following IAV
infection
Using historic strains of IAV, others and we have shown
that female mice develop higher pulmonary inflammatory
responses and experience a more severe outcome from IAV
infection than males [7, 8, 13–15, 37]. To confirm and ex-
pand on previous studies, we intranasally infected adult
male and female mice with a sublethal dose of the
contemporary 2009 H1N1 IAV and monitored them
for sex differences in morbidity. Consistent with pre-
vious reports [7, 8, 13–15, 37], females experienced
greater body mass loss (p < 0.05; Fig. 1a), hypothermia
(p < 0.05, data not shown), and clinical disease (p < 0.05;
data not shown) than males. Males and females were eu-
thanized at several time-points before (5 dpi), during
(9 dpi), and after (14 dpi) peak disease to quantify
pulmonary virus titers. Neither virus titers at 5 and 9
dpi nor clearance of virus by 14 dpi differed between
the sexes (Fig. 1b). Although both males and females
similarly clear virus from the lungs by 14 dpi, lung
diffusing capacity (DFCO) (i.e., a marker of pulmonary
function) returned to baseline faster in males than fe-
males at 14 dpi (p < 0.05; Fig. 1c). Lung sections were

 evaluated for markers of inflammation and damage during
recovery (14 dpi), and females exhibited significantly
greater pulmonary inflammation than males (p < 0.05;
Fig. 1d, e), despite having similar proportions of their
lungs damaged following IAV infection (Fig. 1f).
The epidermal growth factor, AREG, promotes prolif-
eration of epithelial cells and protects mice from exces-
sive
pathology
during
IAV
infection
[11,
20,
38].
Analysis of Areg expression during IAV infection re-
vealed greater mRNA expression during the recovery
phase (i.e., 14 dpi) as compared to peak disease (i.e., 7
dpi) (p < 0.05; Fig. 2a). Further, both Areg mRNA and
AREG protein were more highly expressed in the lungs
of male as compared to female mice at 14 dpi (p < 0.05;
Fig. 2a, b). Using β-tubulin as a marker for respiratory
epithelial cells, AREG was shown to localize primarily in
epithelial cells of the lungs (Fig. 2c).
Respiratory epithelial cells derived from males produce
more AREG than cells from females
Although AREG is produced primarily by epithelial cells
[11, 39] (Fig. 2c), type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2)
and regulatory T cells (Tregs) produce AREG during
IAV infection and contribute to pulmonary repair during
the resolution of infection [20, 38–40]. To study sex
differences in epithelial-specific AREG signaling in the
context of IAV infection, we used an in vitro model sys-
tem in which primary differentiated mTEC cultures were
infected with a high MOI of 2009 H1N1 IAV. Prior to in-
fection, no sex differences in Areg mRNA (Fig. 2d) or
AREG protein (Fig. 2e) were observed. Twenty-four hours
after infection, there was a significant increase in Areg
mRNA (p < 0.05; Fig. 2d) and secreted protein (p < 0.05;
Fig. 2e) from mTECs derived from male, but not female
mice (p < 0.05 for interaction, Fig. 2d), and Areg expres-
sion was significantly greater in IAV-infected cultures
from males as compared with IAV-infected cultures from
females. Similar to the in vivo studies (Fig. 1b), there was
no difference in the virus replication kinetics in mTECs
isolated from male or female mice (Fig. 2f).
AREG binds to the EGFR to have its reparative effects.
Utilizing mock and 2009 H1N1-infected mTECs, we
assessed whether mTECs express EGFR at the apical or
basolateral plasma membranes and whether EGFR is in-
ternalized (i.e., activated [41]) to a greater extent in cul-
tures
derived
from
male
than
female
mice
using
immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Under mock
infection conditions, mTECs expressed EGFR in a diffuse
pattern that was predominately near the basolateral sur-
face, and receptor distribution was similar between males

Fig. 1 Females suffer a worse outcome than males during sub-lethal influenza A virus infection. Adult male and female mice were inoculated
intranasally with a low dose of 2009 H1N1 virus and euthanized at selected time points post-challenge. Mice were monitored daily for changes in
body mass for 25 days post-inoculation (dpi) (a n = 10/sex). Infectious virus titers in the lungs were measure at 5, 9, and 14 dpi (b n = 5–9/sex/
time point), with the TCID50 limit of detection (LOD) illustrated with a dotted line. Pulmonary function, based on lung diffusing capacity (DFCO),
was measured at 14 dpi (c n = 7–8/sex), with the dotted lines representing the values (means ± SEM) for mock-infected mice. H&E stained lung
sections (d) collected at 14 dpi were scored for inflammation (e n = 5–7/sex) and the proportion of lung tissue damaged following infection was
quantified with ImageJ (f n = 5–7/sex). Data represent means ± SEM from two independent experiments, with significant differences represented

 and females (Fig. 3a, b). Following H1N1 IAV infection,
EGFR localization was significantly altered in mTEC
cultures derived from males, but not females (p < 0.05 for
interaction; Fig. 3a), with a strong signal detected closer to
the apical membrane of infected cells (p < 0.05; Fig. 3a, c).
The EGFR was not localized at the apical plasma mem-
brane, as it did not colocalize significantly with the HA pro-
tein, which is an integral membrane protein that targets to
the apical membranes. The EGFR localization was consist-
ent with its presence in endosomes, which is known to
occur after binding of AREG to EGFR. These data suggest
that EGFR localization changes significantly in IAV-infected
mTEC cultures derived from males compared with females.
To determine whether sex differences in the produc-
tion of AREG in response to IAV infection are conserved
across other mammalian hosts and IAV strains, primary
human alveolar epithelial cells (i.e., type I-like pneumo-
cytes) were isolated and differentiated from human lung
tissues and infected with a seasonal H1N1 virus at a high
MOI. Twenty-four hours post-infection (hpi), alveolar
epithelial cells derived from males had higher levels of
Areg mRNA than cells isolated from females following
infection with a seasonal H1N1 virus (p < 0.05; Fig. 4a),
despite having similar levels of viral RNA (Fig. 4b).
Deletion of amphiregulin eliminates sex differences in IAV
pathogenesis
If sex differences in the pathogenesis of influenza are
caused by differential production of AREG, then deletion
of Areg should eliminate sex differences in disease. To test
this hypothesis, male and female Areg−/− and wild-type
(Areg+/+) mice were intranasally infected with a sub-lethal
dose of 2009 H1N1 IAV and monitored for morbidity or
euthanized at select dpi to evaluate pulmonary virus titers,
inflammation, and pulmonary function. Consistent with
our hypothesis, depletion of Areg resulted in similar body
mass loss (Fig. 5a), hypothermia (data not shown), and
clinical disease (data not shown) in males and females.
The lack of a sex-differential effect in IAV pathogenesis
was primarily caused by the effects of depleting Areg in
males, as female Areg−/− and wild-type (Areg+/+) had simi-
lar levels of morbidity (Fig. 5b), whereas male Areg−/−
mice experience greater morbidity than wild-type mice
(p < 0.05; Fig. 5c). There was no effect of Areg deletion on
virus replication kinetics, as both male and female Areg−/−
mice had similar peak titers and clear virus from their
lungs by 14 dpi (Fig. 5d).
Lung sections were evaluated for markers of inflam-
mation and damage during recovery (14 dpi) in both

Fig. 2 Females produce less amphiregulin (AREG) than males during influenza A virus infection. Using RNA isolated from lungs collected at either 7
dpi or 14 dpi, Areg mRNA expression was quantified and normalized to Gapdh using the ΔΔCt method (a n = 7–9/sex). Fixed lungs collected 14 dpi
were used to assess AREG expression (in red) in pulmonary cells (DAPI+, in blue), and β-tubulin was used to identify ciliated epithelial cells (in green)
using immunofluorescence (b). Representative images of bronchioles (× 10 magnification) and focused areas (× 40 magnification) are shown (b). The
percentage of AREG+ cells in the lungs was analyzed and quantified using ImageJ (c n = 15 fields/sex). Mouse tracheal epithelial cell (mTEC) cultures
were isolated and differentiated at an air liquid interface from male and female mice. Twenty-four hours after mock or 2009 H1N1 (MOI = 10) infection,
Areg mRNA relative to Gapdh expression (ΔCt; d) and AREG (pg/ml) secretion into the basolateral media (e) were measured. Infectious virus titers in
IAV-infected mTECs (f) were measured at the indicated time points (n = 8/sex/time point), with the dotted line indicated the TCID50 limit of detection
(LOD). Data represent means ± SEM from two independent experiments, with significant differences represented by asterisks (*)

 Areg−/− and wild-type male and female mice. Although
pulmonary inflammation scores were similar between
male and female Areg−/− mice, inflammation, including
alveolar
inflammation
and
edema,
was
significantly
greater in Areg−/− males compared with the wild-type
males (p < 0.05; Fig. 6a, b). In contrast, inflammation was
equally high in Areg−/− and wild-type females (Fig. 6a, b).
Similarly, deletion of Areg had a greater effect on pulmon-
ary function in males than females, as minute ventilation
and elastance (i.e., a measure of lung recoil following ex-
pansion) were significantly reduced in male Areg−/− as
compared with the wild-type males (p < 0.05; Fig. 6c, d).
By contrast, the one measure of pulmonary function that
was not affected by deletion of Areg was lung diffusing
capacity, which was consistently lower in females than

 with either testosterone or placebo, infected with 2009
H1N1, monitored for morbidity, and euthanized at sev-
eral times post-infection. Consistent with previous stud-
ies [12], gonadectomized males treated with testosterone
exhibited less morbidity than males treated with placebo
(p < 0.05; Fig. 7a). In contrast to our hypothesis, the
presence or absence of testosterone did not affect either
Areg expression (Fig. 7b) or secreted protein (Fig. 7c) in
the lungs of male mice. Thus, AREG production was in-
duced during IAV infection, regardless of testosterone
treatment (p < 0.05; Fig. 7c). Furthermore, treatment of
either gonadectomized wild-type (Areg+/+) or Areg−/−
males with testosterone improved the outcome of
IAV relative to their placebo-treated male counter-
parts (p < 0.05; Fig. 7d). Taken together, these data illus-
trate that AREG-mediated protection against severe IAV
does not require the presence of testosterone.
Discussion
Sex differences in the pathogenesis of IAVs in humans are
reported for pandemic and avian strains and to a lesser ex-
tent for seasonal strains [44]. Mouse models have been in-
tegral for supporting and expanding the epidemiological
data by illustrating that across diverse strains of mice (e.g.,
BALB/c and several C57BL/6 substrains and crosses) in-
fected with diverse IAVs, including H1N1, H3N1, H3N2,
and H7N9, adult females experience more inflammation
and suffer a more severe course of disease than adult
males, despite having similar virus replication kinetics in
the lungs [7, 8, 13, 15, 37]. Consistent with these previous
studies, females infected with 2009 H1N1 experienced
great pulmonary inflammation and were slower to recover
from infection than males, despite having similar kinetics
of virus replication and clearance from the lungs. To-
gether, these data suggest that the failure to resolve in-
flammation as opposed to an inability to control virus
replication contributes to the worse outcome from IAV
infection in females compared with males.
In addition to limiting pulmonary inflammation, males
repaired pulmonary tissue faster than females as illus-
trated by the improved oxygen exchange in the lungs
after virus clearance in males. Male-biased repair of
wounded mucosal tissues, including the lungs and oral
cavity, has been reported in humans and mice [45, 46].
In each case, reduced inflammation in mucosal tissues
from males is associated with better tissue recovery in
males compared with females. In contrast, healing of
dermal wounds is faster for females than males, with

treatment) were gonadectomized, treated with either placebo (Gdx) or testosterone (Gdx + T), inoculated intranasally with a low dose of 2009 H1N1
virus, monitored for changes in body mass (a), and euthanized at one of several time points to measure Areg mRNA (ΔΔCt; b) and protein (c) in the
lungs. Adult male wild-type (Areg+/+) and Areg−/− mice (n = 12–15/treatment/genotype) were gonadectomized, treated with either placebo (−T) or
testosterone (+T), infected with 2009 H1N1 virus, and monitored for changes in body mass for 14 days post-inoculation (dpi; d). Data represent means

 estrogens dampening local inflammation and cellular in-
filtrates to expedite repair of wounded tissue [47, 48],
and testosterone or dihydrotestosterone having deleteri-
ous effects on the repair of wounded tissue [48]. The
tissue-specific mechanisms mediating repair of mucosal
versus dermal tissue may contribute to disparate findings
between the sexes. In pulmonary tissue, resolution of in-
flammation and repair of damaged tissue is faster for
males than females following either injury [46] or infec-
tion (this study).
Wound repair and recovery of mucosal tissue follow-
ing injury or infection are mediated by the production of
cytokines and growth factors in both immune and epi-
thelial cells [18, 19]. Damaged epithelial cells release fac-
tors, including AREG, that can promote repair and
integrity of lung tissue damaged during IAV infection
[20]. Expression of AREG was greater in the lung tissue
as well as in respiratory epithelial cells derived from
males as compared with females during IAV. The sex
differential expression of Areg was greater in the lungs
than in mTECs, possibly because in addition to epithelial
cells, immune cells in the lungs (e.g., CD4+ T cells and
ILCs) also produce AREG [21]. Sex differences in AREG
production in immune cells require consideration. Males
also depended on AREG more than females for faster re-
covery from IAV, because when AREG was deleted from
mice, the impact on pulmonary inflammation and func-
tion was significantly greater for male than for female
mice. Females may still benefit from elevated AREG to
repair damaged lung tissue following IAV infection, but
because wild-type female mice already produce lower
levels of AREG than males, eliminating AREG in the sex
that already expressed low levels of AREG had little im-
pact on the long-term pathogenesis of IAV.
Although several cell types can produce AREG, epithe-
lial cells at mucosal sites are primary producers of AREG
[21]. Respiratory epithelial cells are also the primary cell
type infected with IAVs. The reparative effects of AREG
are mediated by its low affinity binding to the EGFR
[49, 50], which results in slower EGFR internalization
and sustained downstream signaling [22]. AREG-EGFR
signaling is hypothesized to aid in tissue repair through
differentiation and proliferation of tissue resident cells,
such as epithelial cells, which express EGFR [23]. More-
over, in cancer models, there is evidence of bidirectional
cross-talk between sex steroid receptors, including andro-
gen and progesterone receptors, and EGFR signaling path-
ways
[51–53].
In the
present
study,
although
IAV
replication in respiratory epithelial cells derived from ei-
ther humans or mice did not differ between the sexes,
production of AREG and internalization of EGFR was
greater in respiratory epithelial cells derived from males
than females, which may be mediated sex steroid hor-
mone signaling.
Previous studies illustrate that treatment of gonadecto-
mized wild-type female mice with progesterone significantly
increases production of AREG, enhances cellular prolif-
eration in the lungs, reduces pulmonary inflammation,
and improves the outcome of IAV when compared with
gonadectomized females treated with placebo [11]. In
the absence of AREG (i.e., Areg−/−), progesterone does
not improve the outcome of IAV in females, suggesting
that
the
protective
effects
of
progesterone
are
dependent on AREG signaling in females [11]. Proges-
terone treatment of mTECs also increases production
of AREG following injury and promotes faster repair of
the cellular monolayer, illustrating that respiratory epi-
thelial cells are responsive to progesterone and respond
by increasing the production of AREG to repair dam-
aged tissue [11].
In addition to progesterone in females [11], testoster-
one in males has been shown to increase production of
AREG in the reproductive tract [42, 43]. In the respira-
tory tract, however, the elevated production of AREG in
males appeared to be independent of testosterone, as go-
nadectomy and exogenous testosterone replacement had
no effect on AREG expression in the lungs during IAV
infection. Furthermore, treatment of either wild-type or
Areg−/− gonadectomized male mice with testosterone
improved the outcome of IAV when compared with
their placebo-treated counterparts, suggesting that tes-
tosterone and AREG confer protection possibly through
independent mechanisms. Whether testosterone and
AREG have synergistic effects on the repair of pulmon-
ary tissue following IAV requires further evaluation be-
cause males that were devoid of both testosterone and
AREG suffered the most severe outcome from IAV, sug-
gesting that both factors are required for optimal recov-
ery from IAV in males.
Previous studies illustrate that testosterone is neces-
sary to reduce the severity of influenza in young adult
male mice [12]. Testosterone treatment of male mice
limits pulmonary inflammation and promotes faster re-
covery from IAV. In addition to testosterone, genetic
variation in the Y chromosome also influences immuno-
pathology, but not virus replication, during IAV infec-
tion in males [37]. Whether the AREG gene, which is
encoded on chromosome 5, is regulated by elements on
the Y chromosome in males should be considered.
Conclusions
Resistance or the ability to reduce viral load often de-
fines protection and reduced susceptibility to infection.
Although resistance is one way to defend against infec-
tion, another mechanism, called tolerance, is to limit the
damage caused by the virus or the host immune
response to the virus (i.e., immunopathology) [54]. Host
tolerance

infection

 presumably serves to enable the host to maintain health
regardless of virus burden. In the context of IAVs, males
and females are equally resistant to IAVs, but males
maintain greater tolerance during infection by limiting
inflammation and immunopathology, while maintaining
similar viral clearance kinetics as females. The data from
the current study further illustrate that in addition to
having greater tolerance to IAV infection, males also
have faster repair of damaged tissue than females sug-
gesting that resilience (i.e., responses that repair dam-
aged tissue) may also be greater in males. For several
infections, in which tissue damage caused by excessive
immune responses to infection results in a more severe
outcome
from
infection
(e.g.,
HIV,
influenza,
and
Staphylococcus aureus), it is females who suffer a worse
outcome [7, 55–58]. The data from the present study il-
lustrate that males may have greater tolerance and resili-
ence to IAVs than females, as males experience less
inflammation, repair damaged tissue quicker, and re-
cover from IAV infection faster than females, which is
mediated by elevated levels of both AREG and testoster-
one in males.
