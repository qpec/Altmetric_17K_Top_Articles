Abstract
Study Objectives: To quantify the relationship between acute sleep deprivation and culpable involvement in motor vehicle 
crashes.
Methods: Participants were 6845 drivers involved in a representative sample of crashes investigated by the US Department 
of Transportation in years 2005–2007. A modified case–control study design was used to compare self-reported hours of 
sleep in the 24 hr before crashing between drivers deemed culpable versus nonculpable. Analyses controlled for fatigue-
related, driver-related, and environmental factors. Specific errors that led to crashes were also examined.
Results: Drivers who reported having slept for 6, 5, 4, and less than 4 hr in the 24 hr before crashing had 1.3 (95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 1.04 to 1.7), 1.9 (1.1 to 3.2), 2.9 (1.4 to 6.2), and 15.1 (4.2 to 54.4) times the odds, respectively, of having been culpable 
for their crashes, compared with drivers who reported 7–9 hr of sleep. Drivers who had slept less than 4 hr had 3.4 (95% 
CI = 2.1 to 5.6) times the increase in odds of culpable involvement in single-vehicle crashes compared with multiple-vehicle 
crashes. Recent change in sleep schedule, typically feeling drowsy upon waking, and driving for 3+ hr were also associated with 
culpability (all p ≤ 0.013). Assuming nonculpable drivers comprised a representative sample of all drivers present where crashes 
occurred, these odds ratios approximate incidence rate ratios for culpable crash involvement per unit of time driving.
Conclusions: Driving after having slept less than 7 hr in a 24 hr period is associated with elevated risk of culpable crash 
involvement. Risk is greatest for drivers who have slept less than 4 hr and is manifested disproportionately in single-vehicle 
crashes.
Key Words:  sleep deprivation; motor vehicle; automobile; crash; accident; driving
Statement of Significance
This is the first study in the peer-reviewed literature to quantify a dose–response relationship between drivers’ sleep in 
the past 24 hr and their risk of causing a motor vehicle crash in a representative sample of crashes involving the general 
driving population. Risks were elevated measurably for all drivers who slept for less than 7 hr and increased further with 
decreasing sleep. Drivers who slept for less than 4 hr were found to have crash risk comparable to that reported in previ-
ous studies for drivers with blood alcohol concentration roughly 1.5 times the legal limit effective in all US states. These 
findings could be used to educate drivers, healthcare providers, and policymakers about how sleep deprivation affects 
driving safety.

 Introduction
Experts recommend that adults should sleep for 7–9 hr per 
night to promote optimal health [1, 2], yet surveys indicate that 
approximately one in five US adults sleeps for less than 7 hr on 
any given night [3], and one in three report usually sleeping for 
less than 7 hr daily [4]. An estimated 7 per cent of all motor vehi-
cle crashes in the United States and 16 per cent of fatal crashes 
involve driver drowsiness [5]. The National Transportation Safety 
Board has identified fatigue as a probable cause, a contributing 
factor, or a finding in 40 per cent of all of its major highway acci-
dent investigations [6].
Studies using laboratory-based measures of attention and 
reaction time have found that participants kept awake for pro-
longed periods of time experience longer and more frequent 
lapses in attention [7]. Studies comparing the effects of sustained 
wakefulness and alcohol consumption on tasks including reac-
tion time, hand-eye coordination, and simulated driving perform-
ance have found similar performance decrements associated with 
both [8–10]. Case–control studies have compared binary measures 
of acute sleep deprivation (e.g. ≤5 hr of sleep in the past 24 hr) 
among drivers involved in real-world crashes versus among con-
trols sampled from the population of non–crash-involved drivers 
on the road [11, 12]. However, case–control studies to date have 
not quantified a dose–response relationship between a measure 
of sleep deprivation and real-world crash risk, largely due to the 
rarity of encountering drivers who report having slept very little 
in population-based samples of non-crash-involved drivers, the 
size of which is typically constrained by resources.
A study design sometimes used to estimate the association of 
some factor of interest with the risk of causing a motor vehicle 
crash, in the absence of data on the prevalence of the factor in 
the general population, is quasi-induced exposure or the related 
culpability analysis [13–18]. These study designs involve com-
paring the prevalence of the factor of interest (e.g. sleep depriv-
ation) among drivers found “culpable” or “responsible” (hereafter 
“culpable”) for their crashes versus among drivers found not 
culpable. From an analytic standpoint, this is analogous to a 
modified case–control study in which the “disease” is culpabil-
ity for a crash rather than simple involvement in a crash. The 
resulting odds ratio (OR) is the ratio of the odds of being culp-
able versus nonculpable for a crash among crash-involved driv-
ers with versus without the risk factor. While this OR is typically 
not of substantive interest in itself, under certain assumptions, it 
approximates a more useful quantity. Specifically, if nonculpable 
drivers are assumed to have been involved in crashes solely due 
to the chance occurrence that they were driving at a time and 
place at which factors outside of their control caused the crash 
to occur, then they should approximate a random sample of all 
drivers present at the times and places of crashes. If this assump-
tion holds, the OR for culpability given a crash approximates the 
OR for culpable crash involvement per unit of time spent driving. 
Because nonculpable drivers are sampled from among drivers 
present when new cases arise (i.e. when culpable drivers crash), 
this OR approximates an incidence rate ratio [19, 20].
In a report published by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety 
(AAAFTS), the author of the current study used the culpability 
study design to estimate the relationship between the number 
of hours that drivers had slept in the 24 hr before crashes and 
their odds of culpability [21]. The current study builds upon and 
refines the analysis presented in the AAAFTS report by examin-
ing the relationships between sleep deprivation and the odds 
of culpable involvement in single-vehicle crashes and multiple-
vehicle crashes separately, by examining the specific types of 
driving errors committed by culpable drivers in relation to the 
number of hours that they reported having slept, and by con-
trolling for additional fatigue-related covariates not examined 
in the AAAFTS study.
Materials and Methods
Design, setting, and participants
This study examined the relationship between the number 
of hours that crash-involved drivers reported having slept in 
the 24 hr before crashing and the odds that the drivers were 
culpable for their crashes, using a modified case–control study 
design in which cases were drivers classified as culpable and 
controls were drivers classified as nonculpable.
The current study involved secondary analysis of data col-
lected in a previous study by the US Department of 
Transportation 
(DOT) [22–25]. In that study, a sample of 5470 motor vehicle 
crashes that occurred between July 2005 and December 2007 and 
involved 10 
239 drivers were subject to in-depth multidisciplin-
ary crash investigations that included interviews with drivers by 
trained investigators independent of law enforcement. Inclusion 
criteria for the DOT study were that the crash occurred on a pub-
lic roadway between the hours of 6:00 am and 11:59 pm; involved 
at least one car, pickup truck, van, minivan, or sport utility vehi-
cle that was towed due to damage; and resulted in emergency 
medical services dispatch to the scene. Crashes were sampled 
from 24 central cities, large counties, or groups of counties across 
the United States stratified by region and extent of urbanization. 
The sample was designed to be representative of all crashes 
nationwide subject to the inclusion criteria; a detailed descrip-
tion is available in a report by the US DOT [25].
The data collection performed by the US DOT was authorized 
under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 
(Public Law 89–563, Title 1, Section 106) and approved by the US 
Office of Management and Budget (Control Number 2127-0021). 
The current study was exempt from IRB review because the DOT 
study data are available for public use and the author had no 
interaction with participants nor access to any personal identi-
fying information.
Variables
Outcome variables
The main outcome variable was a binary indicator of whether 
each driver was classified as culpable or nonculpable for the 
crash. In some analyses, the outcome variable was the cross-
classification of culpability and crash type (single-vehicle versus 
multiple-vehicle crash).
The author classified each driver as culpable or nonculpable 
on the basis of specific precrash actions and events documented 
by the on-scene crash investigators for the DOT study [23, 24]. 
Specifically, a driver was classified as culpable if the investiga-
tors reported that the event that made the occurrence of the 
crash inevitable (termed “critical precrash event” in the DOT 
study) was an action by the driver, and the reason for the occur-
rence of that event (the “critical reason”) was an unsafe or illegal 
action, inaction, or error committed by that driver. Examples of 
frequently cited critical reasons include the driver’s failure to

 look (e.g. before entering an intersection), driving too fast for 
conditions or too fast to respond to another driver’s actions, and 
misjudgment of a gap in traffic or of another vehicle’s speed. 
In a small number of crashes, investigators reported that the 
critical reason for the crash was that the driver was asleep at 
the onset of the critical precrash event. However, aside from 
determination that the driver was actually asleep, investigators’ 
judgment of whether a driver was fatigued or drowsy was not 
considered in their determination of the critical reason [24], nor 
in the authors’ assignment of culpability.
The purpose of the culpability assessment in the context of 
the current study was solely to differentiate between drivers 
who played a clear active role in the occurrence of the crash ver-
sus drivers who were involved in crashes mainly due to factors 
beyond their immediate control. The word “culpability” is used 
only for brevity and consistency with other traffic safety litera-
ture; it is not intended to imply a determination of whether a 
driver was legally culpable or “at fault” for the crash. (The DOT 
investigators did not assign fault [24].)
Explanatory variables
The main explanatory variable was the number of hours that a 
driver reported having slept in the 24 hr before the crash. This 
variable was derived from the start and end times of the driver’s 
main sleep and all naps longer than 30 minutes in the 24 hr 
before the crash, which drivers reported to crash investigators 
in interviews conducted at the crash scene or elsewhere (e.g. a 
medical facility) shortly after the crash [24]. Sleep was not the 
focus of the interview; only a small portion of all interview ques-
tions pertained to sleep.
For analysis purposes, the number of hours that the driver 
had slept in the 24 hr before the crash was grouped into 1 hr 
intervals. Few drivers reported less than 3 hr of sleep, thus driv-
ers who reported less than 3 hr of sleep were grouped with driv-
ers who reported having slept for 3 hr. Drivers who reported 
having slept for 7–9 hr in the past 24 hr were used as the ref-
erence group because this is the amount of sleep that experts 
recommend for healthy adults [1, 2].
Fatigue-related covariates included in the study were:
• A binary indicator of whether the driver reported having 
changed his or her sleep or work hours in the 7 days pre-
ceding the crash, to capture the potential effect of Circadian 
disruption.
• A binary indicator of whether the driver reported that he or 
she typically felt fatigued or drowsy upon waking (in general, 
not specifically on the day of the crash), to reflect effects of 
possible chronic sleep restriction, sleep disorders, chrono-
type, or other medical issues not recorded in the data.
• The number of hours that the driver reported having been 
driving prior to the crash (<1, 1, 2, 3+), to reflect possible task-
related fatigue.
Potential confounders included in analyses were as follows: 
driver age in years (modeled using age and age squared to 
account for the curvilinear relationship between age and crash 
rate [26]), sex; vehicle type (car or light truck versus large truck 
or bus); road type (one way, two-way undivided, two-way with 
center left turn lane, two-way without positive median barrier; 
two-way with positive median barrier), speed limit (<35; 35–40; 
45–50; 55+ miles per hour), weather conditions (binary indica-
tors for presence of rain, sleet or freezing rain, snow, and fog), 
roadway surface conditions (dry; wet; other), and lighting con-
ditions (daylight; dark-unlit; dark-lit; dawn; dusk). In addition, 
hour of day, day of week, season of year, and jurisdiction in 
which the crash occurred were included in models to increase 
the plausibility of the assumption that nonculpable drivers were 
representative of all drivers present at the times and places at 
which the culpable drivers crashed.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Drivers from the original DOT study were included in the cur-
rent study if they were:
• Driving a car or truck, and
• Involved in a crash in which a driver of a car or truck (i.e. this 
driver or another driver) was classified as culpable per the 
criteria outlined previously.
Drivers were excluded from the current study if they:
• Were not driving a car or truck (e.g. driving a motorcycle, 
farm equipment, construction equipment, or other/unknown 
vehicle type), or
• Suffered an incapacitating medical event (e.g. heart attack, 
stroke, or seizure) immediately prior to the crash, or
• Were involved in a crash in which no eligible driver was clas-
sified as culpable. These included crashes in which:
o The culpable driver was driving an ineligible vehicle type, or
o No driver was culpable because investigators determined 
that the critical reason for the critical precrash event was 
vehicle mechanical failure, an environmental condition, or 
an action by a pedestrian or bicyclist, or
o No driver was classified as culpable because investigators 
were unable to determine the critical reason for the critical 
precrash event.
Of the 10 
239 drivers in the original DOT study, 801 were 
excluded per the criteria outlined above (52 were not driving a 
car or truck; 611 were involved in a crash in which no eligible 
driver was classified as culpable; 138 suffered an incapacitating 
medical event immediately prior to the crash). After these exclu-
sions, 9438 drivers remained for analysis.
Statistical analysis
The relationship between the number of hours that a driver 
reported having slept in the 24 hr before the crash and the odds 
that the driver was deemed culpable for the crash was quan-
tified using logistic regression. Ordinary logistic regression 
was used to estimate the relationship between sleep and the 
overall odds of culpability for any crash irrespective of crash 
type. Multinomial logistic regression was used to quantify the 
effects of sleep deprivation on the odds of culpable involve-
ment in single-vehicle crashes and multiple-vehicle crashes 
specifically [15, 27].
Data were weighted to account for each crash’s probability 
of selection for the original DOT study [24]. All analyses were 
based on the weighted data. Statistical tests accounted for the 
stratification and clustering of the sample. The statistical signifi-
cance of bivariate comparisons was evaluated using chi-square 
tests adjusted for stratification and clustering and converted 
to F statistics [28]. Variances of ORs were estimated using the

 robust variance estimator. Heterogeneity of the effect of sleep 
deprivation and covariates on culpability for single-vehicle ver-
sus multiple-vehicle crashes was evaluated using Wald tests 
of differences of the respective ORs after estimating the multi-
nomial logistic regression model [29]. Analyses were performed 
using Stata version 15.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
The distributions of the critical reasons for crashes among 
culpable drivers in relation to the number of hours that they had 
slept were examined post hoc.
Missing values
Drivers with missing values for variables needed to classify 
hours of sleep (n = 2593; 27.5% of eligible drivers) were excluded 
from statistical analysis. The proportions of drivers missing 
data on sleep did not differ statistically nor practically between 
nonculpable drivers, drivers culpable for single-vehicle crashes, 
and drivers culpable for multiple-vehicle crashes (27.4%, 28.0%, 
and 27.4%, respectively; p = 0.90). The majority of these drivers 
(n = 1903; 73.4% of drivers with missing sleep) simply were not 
interviewed and thus had no opportunity to report their sleep.
A small portion of eligible drivers who reported their hours of 
sleep had missing values for one or more covariates or confound-
ers (number missing: time driving before crash, 222; speed limit, 
76; feeling fatigued/drowsy upon waking, 55; changed sleep/work 
schedule, 30; age, 2). Missing values of these variables were imputed 
so that all eligible drivers who reported their sleep could be included 
in analyses. Imputation was performed 10 times using the method 
of chained equations [30], producing 10 independent data sets with 
missing values replaced by imputed values. All variables included 
in the above-described analyses were included in the imputation 
model for each variable; missing values were assumed missing at 
random conditional upon the covariates included in the model. The 
above-described analyses were performed on each imputed data 
set separately and were then combined to incorporate the uncer-
tainty in the imputed values into the estimates of variances [31].
Assessment of possible biases
Three potential sources of bias in the current study are violation 
of the assumption that nonculpable drivers comprise a repre-
sentative sample of all drivers present at the times and places 
where crashes occur, bias in self-reported hours of sleep, and 
lack of data on alcohol and drug use for most drivers.
Representativeness of nonculpable drivers
To test the assumption that nonculpable drivers comprised a rep-
resentative sample of all drivers present at the times and places 
where crashes occurred, the characteristics of the nonculpable 
driver sample were compared between three distinct groups of 
nonculpable drivers:
1. Nonculpable drivers involved in two-vehicle crashes,
2. Nonculpable driver involved first in crashes involving three 
or more vehicles, and
3. Nonculpable drivers involved later in crashes involving 
three or more vehicles.
The rationale behind this comparison is that nonculpable involve-
ment later in the sequence of events in a chain-reaction crash argu-
ably is influenced more by random chance and less by driver behavior 
or performance than is involvement as the first nonculpable driver 
in a crash. Thus, similarity between these three groups supports 
the assumption that nonculpable drivers comprise a representa-
tive sample of all drivers present when and where crashes occur, 
whereas dissimilarity refutes that assumption [32, 33].
Bias in self-reported hours of sleep
The sensitivity of the main results to biases in self-reported 
hours of sleep was examined by simulating various hypothetical 
scenarios in which 0, 10, or 25 per cent of culpable and/or noncul-
pable drivers exaggerated how much they had slept by an aver-
age of 1 hr. For each scenario, 500 simulations were performed 
in which the main analysis was replicated with hypothetical 
overreporting of sleep, modeled as a truncated normal distrib-
uted random variable with mean 1 hr; SD 1 hr; and minimum 0, 
subtracted from the self-reported sleep of a random sample of 
the drivers indicated for that scenario. Odds of culpability were 
then calculated in relation to drivers’ hypothetical “actual” hours 
of sleep rather than the number of hours that they reported. 
Results reported for each scenario are the median OR from the 
500 simulations and the 95 per cent simulation interval of the 
OR (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) adjusted for random error [34].
Lack of data on alcohol and drugs
The DOT study did not collect blood samples to test for alcohol 
or drugs; thus, the only source of data available for most driv-
ers regarding alcohol or drug use was the police report associ-
ated with the crash, which in most instances was not verified 
by chemical tests. To attempt to gain some insight into possible 
bias due to lack of data on alcohol and drug use, the main ana-
lysis was replicated with drivers for whom the police affirma-
tively indicated alcohol or illegal drug use excluded (n = 195).
Results
Description of sample
Table 1 shows the number of hours that drivers reported having 
slept in the 24 hr prior to crashes, fatigue-related covariates, and 
selected confounders in relation to driver culpability for the crash 
and crash type among the 6845 drivers included in the final study 
sample. Overall, 78 per cent of nonculpable drivers and 70 per cent 
of culpable drivers reported having slept for 7–9 hr in the 24 hr 
before crashing, 7 per cent of nonculpable and 8 per cent of culp-
able drivers reported 6 hr of sleep, and small percentages reported 
less than 6 hr of sleep. The distribution of hours of sleep in the 
24 hr before the crash varied significantly between culpable and 
nonculpable drivers (p < 0.0001). Notably, all but 5 of the 80 drivers 
who reported less than 4 hr of sleep were classified as culpable.
The proportion of drivers who had changed their sleep or 
work schedule in the past 7 days (6% of culpable versus 4% of 
nonculpable; p < 0.0001), the proportion who reported usually 
feeling fatigued or drowsy upon waking (9% of culpable versus 
4% of nonculpable; p = 0.0001), the age distribution (p < 0.0001), 
and the distribution of crashes by time of day (p = 0.025) differed 
significantly between culpable versus nonculpable drivers as 
well. Culpable and nonculpable drivers differed marginally with 
respect to the day of week on which they crashed (p = 0.067) and 
the number of hours that they had been driving prior to crash-
ing (p = 0.085). They did not differ with respect to sex (p = 0.22).
The distribution of hours of sleep also differed significantly 
between drivers culpable for single-vehicle versus multi-vehicle

 crashes (p = 0.006), with the shortest sleep durations more com-
mon among drivers culpable for single-vehicle crashes than 
multi-vehicle crashes. Culpable drivers involved in single-vehi-
cle crashes also tended to have been driving for longer prior to 
the crash (p = 0.039), had a greater proportion of their crashes 
before 9:00 am and after 9:00 pm (p = 0.0002) and on the week-
end (p = 0.002). Culpable drivers in single-vehicle crashes also 
tended to be younger than culpable drivers in multiple-vehicle 
crashes (p = 0.034) and were marginally more likely to report typ-
ically feeling fatigued or drowsy upon waking (p = 0.067).
Sleep deprivation and odds of culpability
Table 2 shows ORs for the associations of sleep in the past 24 hr and 
fatigue-related covariates with culpability for crashes. Compared 
with drivers who reported having slept for 7–9 hr in the 24 hr 
before the crash, drivers who reported less than 7 hr of sleep had 
statistically elevated odds of having been culpable for the crash, 
with ORs ranging from 1.3 (95% confidence Interval [CI] = 1.04 
to 1.7) for drivers who reported having slept for 6 hr to 15.1 (95% 
CI = 4.2 to 54.4) for drivers who reported having slept for less than 
4 hr. Odds of culpability were elevated slightly for drivers who 
reported having slept for 10 hr or more; however, this was not stat-
istically significant (OR 1.3, 95% CI = 0.9 to 1.7). Odds of culpability 
were also elevated significantly for drivers who had changed their 
sleep or work schedule in the past 7 days (OR 1.3, 95% CI = 1.1 to 
1.6), drivers who reported that they typically felt fatigued or drowsy 
upon waking (OR 2.2, 95% CI = 1.5 to 3.2), and drivers who had been 
driving for 3 hr or longer prior to the crash (OR 2.9, 95% CI = 1.4 to 
6.1) relative to those who had been driving for less than 1 hr.
ORs for culpable involvement in single-vehicle and multiple-
vehicle crashes differed significantly from one another (p = 0.008 
for heterogeneity of all ORs for sleep by crash type). Post hoc com-
parisons revealed that the only statistically significant difference

 between ORs for culpable involvement in single-vehicle versus 
multiple-vehicle crashes was for drivers who had slept for less 
than 4 hr (Figure 1). Compared with drivers who had slept for 
7–9 hr, drivers who had slept for less than 4 hr had 33.6 times 
the odds of culpable involvement in single-vehicle crashes (95% 
CI = 8.9 to 126.8) and 9.7 (95% CI = 2.2 to 42.4) times the odds of culp-
able involvement in multiple-vehicle crashes (ratio of ORs 3.4, 95% 
CI = 2.1 to 5.6, p = 0.0001). Ratios of ORs for culpable involvement 
in single-vehicle versus multiple-vehicle crashes for drivers who 
reported 4, 5, 6, and 10+ hr of sleep relative to drivers who reported 
7–9 hr of sleep were 1.1 (95% CI = 0.4 to 3.1), 1.1 (95% CI = 0.5 to 2.2), 
1.0 (95% CI = 0.7 to 1.6), and 0.8 (95% CI = 0.5 to 1.1), respectively.
ORs for culpable involvement in single-vehicle crashes did not 
differ significantly from those for culpable involvement in multiple-
vehicle crashes for drivers who reported having changed their sleep 
or work schedules in the 7 days preceding the crash (ratio of ORs 
1.0, 95% CI = 0.7 to 1.4). The OR for culpable involvement in single-
vehicle vehicle crashes associated with typically feeling fatigued or 
drowsy upon waking (OR 3.1, 95% CI = 1.6 to 6.1) appeared consid-
erably larger than the corresponding OR for culpable involvement 
in multiple-vehicle crashes (OR 1.9, 95% CI = 1.3 to 3.0); however, 
these did not differ significantly from one another (ratio of ORs 1.6, 
95% CI = 0.8 to 3.3). ORs for culpable crash involvement in relation 
to hours of driving prior to the crash did not differ between single-
vehicle versus multiple-vehicle crashes (p = 0.89 for heterogeneity 
of all ORs for hours of driving by crash type).
Critical reasons for crash involvement in relation to 
hours of sleep
Table 3 shows the types of driving actions, inactions, and errors 
recorded by DOT investigators as the critical reasons for culpable 
drivers’ involvement in crashes in relation to the number of hours 
that they reported having slept. The distribution of the types of 
critical reasons differed significantly in relation to hours of sleep 
(p = 0.0003). Notably, the proportion of culpable drivers who were 
reported to have actually been asleep at the time of the critical 
precrash event increased monotonically with decreasing hours of 
sleep, ranging from 1.4 per cent (CI = 1.0% to 2.0%) among driv-
ers who reported having slept for 7+ hr to 32 per cent (CI = 24% 
to 41%) among drivers who reported having slept for less than 
4 hr (p = 0.0001 for trend). Overcompensation and poor directional 
control, possibly suggestive of a driver recovering from a micros-
leep, were also cited much more frequently among culpable driv-
ers who reported less than 4 hr of sleep (overcompensation: 23%, 
CI = 13% to 37%; poor directional control: 14%, CI = 6% to 28%) 
than among those who reported 4 or more hours of sleep (over-
compensation: 5%, CI = 4% to 7%; poor directional control: 4%, 
CI = 3% to 5%). Excluding crashes in which the culpable driver fell 
asleep, the distributions of critical reasons were similar among 
drivers who reported 5, 6, and 7+ hr of sleep (p = 0.36).
Assessment of possible biases
Representativeness of nonculpable drivers
Table 4 compares sleep, fatigue-related covariates, and driver 
demographics between three groups of nonculpable drivers: 
those involved in two-vehicle crashes, those involved first in 
crashes with three or more vehicles, and those involved later in 
crashes with three or more vehicles. Neither nonculpable drivers 
in two-vehicle crashes nor nonculpable drivers involved first in 
crashes with three or more vehicles differed significantly from 
nonculpable drivers involved later in crashes with three or more 
vehicles. While some comparisons approached statistical signifi-
cance, all differences were small in a practical sense (e.g. driv-
ers involved later in crashes with three or more vehicles were 
slightly more likely to report 7–9 hr of sleep and slightly less 
likely to report 6 or 10+ hr of sleep than the other two groups). 
Assuming that nonculpable involvement later in the sequence

culpable driver, this similarity supports the assumption that the

 Bias in self-reported hours of sleep
Table 5 shows ORs from simulations of various scenarios in 
which 0, 10, or 25 per cent of culpable and/or nonculpable driv-
ers were assumed to have overreported how much they had 
slept by an average of 1 hr. The upper left quadrant of the table 
shows results obtained assuming no systematic overreport-
ing of sleep by culpable nor nonculpable drivers (i.e. the main 
results from Table 2). The other groups of ORs on the main diag-
onal represent nondifferential overreporting of sleep by culpable 
and nonculpable drivers. In these scenarios, simulated results 
suggest that nondifferential overreporting of sleep would cause 
the main study results to overestimate the magnitude of the 
effect of sleep deprivation on culpable crash involvement, but 
preserve the correct general pattern of the associations.
Values above the main diagonal represent differential overre-
porting in which culpable drivers were more likely than noncul-
pable drivers to exaggerate how much they had slept. Simulation 
results suggest that this type of differential overreporting of sleep 
would cause the main results to underestimate the effect of sleep 
deprivation on culpable crash involvement, with the possible excep-
tion of drivers who slept less than 4 hr. Because so few nonculpable 
drivers reported having slept for less than 4 hr, the misclassification 
of even a small number of nonculpable drivers who actually slept 
for less than 4 hr into other sleep categories could still bias this OR 
away from the null, even if similar exaggeration of sleep were con-
siderably more common among the culpable drivers.
Values below the main diagonal represent differential over-
reporting in which nonculpable drivers were more likely than 
culpable drivers to overreport their sleep. These simulated 
results indicate that this type of differential overreporting of 
sleep would cause the main study results to overestimate the 
effect of sleep deprivation on culpable crash involvement.
Lack of data on alcohol and drugs
Removing 195 drivers for whom police reported presence of 
alcohol or drugs had minimal statistical and practical impact on 
the main study results. The overall OR for culpability associated 
with 6 hr of sleep did not change in magnitude but was no longer 
statistically significant (OR 1.3, 95% CI = 0.9 to 1.8). The ORs for 
culpability associated with less than 4 hr of sleep remained stat-
istically significant but decreased slightly in magnitude to 12.6 
(95% CI = 3.2 to 51.7) for all crashes, 8.7 (95% CI = 2.0 to 38.5) 
for multiple-vehicle crashes, and 25.0 (95% CI = 5.3 to 116.9) for 
single-vehicle crashes.
Discussion
This study quantified a dose–response relationship between the 
amount that a crash-involved driver reported having slept in the 
24 hr preceding crash involvement and the odds that the driver 
was found culpable for the crash. Drivers who reported having 
slept for less than 7 hr had a statistically detectable increase 
in the odds of having been culpable, the magnitude of which 
increased as hours of sleep decreased. If nonculpable drivers 
comprise a representative sample of all drivers present where 
crashes occur, these ORs approximate incidence rate ratios for 
culpable crash involvement per unit of time spent driving.
The current study builds upon and refines previous work by 
the same author [21], producing several new findings. Drivers 
who had slept for less than 4 hr experienced a significantly 
greater increase in odds of culpable involvement in single-vehicle 
crashes than multiple-vehicle crashes. This finding is consistent 
with previous literature [5, 35] and is important because single-
vehicle crashes are over three times as likely as multiple-vehicle 
crashes to result in fatalities [36]. Another novel finding of the

Odds ratios are medians from 500 simulations in which hypothetical overreporting of sleep was modeled as a truncated normal distributed random variable (mean 
1 hr; SD 1 hr; minimum 0) subtracted from self-reported hours of sleep for a randomly selected subset of drivers as indicated for each row/column of table. Endpoints 
of 95% confidence interval are 2.5th and 97.5th percentile odds ratios from simulation adjusted for random error. All odds ratios are adjusted for driver demographics, 
environmental factors, and fatigue-related covariates as in main analysis. Odds ratios in upper left quadrant of table are the main study results as reported in Table 2.

 current study is that while most culpable crashes of drivers who 
had slept for less than 4 hr were attributed to the driver having 
fallen asleep or to distinctive driving errors arguably suggestive 
of microsleeps, most culpable crashes of drivers who reported 
4–6 hr of sleep were attributed to driving errors of the same gen-
eral variety as those of culpable drivers who had slept for 7 hr or 
longer. This finding illustrates that in addition to the obvious risk 
of falling asleep while driving, sleep deprivation also increases 
drivers’ risk of committing the types of driving errors that also 
lead non-sleep-deprived drivers to crash. The current study also 
found that drivers who had changed their sleep or work sched-
ule in the previous 7 days, typically felt fatigued or drowsy upon 
waking, or had been driving for 3 or more hours without a break 
had significantly elevated odds of culpable crash involvement. 
Furthermore, adjustment for these fatigue-related covariates 
also enhances the robustness of the main results with respect to 
sleep deprivation relative to those reported previously [21].
The results of the current study confirm and extend the 
results of previous work by others as well. Laboratory-based 
studies have found sleep deprivation—typically operationalized 
in terms of hours of continuous wakefulness—is detrimental 
to participants’ reaction time, response accuracy, and lapses in 
attention [7], all of which are clearly critical to safe driving. One 
study that examined simulated driving performance found that 
drivers’ variability in speed and lane position were as impaired 
after 21 hr of continuous wakefulness as they were at a blood 
alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.08 grams of alcohol per deciliter 
of blood (g/dL) [10]. The latter finding regarding lane position is 
entirely consistent with the current study’s finding that over-
compensation and poor directional control were much more 
likely to be cited as the critical reasons for the crashes of drivers 
who had slept for less than 4 hr.
A case–control study conducted in New Zealand found that 
drivers who reported having slept for 5 hr or less in the past 
24 hr had 2.7 times the crash risk of drivers who reported having 
slept for more than 5 hr [11]. A similar case–control study in Fiji 
found that drivers who reported having slept for less than 6 of 
the past 24 hr had 5.9 times the odds of crash involvement of 
drivers who reported having slept for 6 hr or longer [12]. For the 
sake of comparison, the main analysis from the current study 
was replicated with sleep recoded as in the two above-men-
tioned case–control studies: the resultant OR for culpable crash 
involvement associated with having slept for less than 6 hr vs. 
6+ hr was 2.9 (95% CI = 2.2 to 3.8), similar to that reported in the 
New Zealand case–control study [11].
A source of impairment to safe driving ability whose dose–
response relationship to motor vehicle crash risk has been stud-
ied extensively is alcohol. A large case–control study by the US 
DOT estimated that the relative risk of crash involvement for 
a driver with a BAC equal to 0.08 g/dL relative to a sober driver 
is approximately 3.9 [37]. That study, however, estimated the 
relative risk of involvement in any crash irrespective of culp-
ability; the current study estimates the relative risk of culpable 
involvement in a crash, or colloquially, the risk of causing a 
crash. Another study applied the culpability analysis approach 
to the cases in the [37] to compare the results obtained by the 
two study designs, and estimated an OR of 5.6 for culpable crash 
involvement associated with a BAC of 0.08 [18]. The current 
study’s ORs for culpable crash involvement associated with 5, 4, 
and less than 4 hr of sleep were similar to ORs estimated in that 
study for drivers with BACs of 0.03, 0.05, and 0.12, respectively 
[18]. This similarity of the effects of sleep deprivation estimated 
herein and the effects of alcohol estimated in previous studies 
[18, 37] is broadly consistent with the results of laboratory-based 
studies that have compared the effects of these two risk factors 
within the same experiment [8–10].
A panel of experts convened by the National Sleep Foundation 
in 2015 concluded based on review of evidence available at the 
time that “Drivers who have slept for two hours or less in the 
preceding 24 hours are not fit to operate a motor vehicle” [38]. 
The authors noted that members of the panel believed that lab-
oratory-based data indicated that drivers would be significantly 
impaired by sleep loss after having slept for 3, 4, or 5 hr in a 
24 hr period, but they found existing epidemiologic data on the 
relationship between sleep deprivation and involvement in real-
world crashes insufficient to support labelling a driver who had 
slept for 3, 4, or 5 hr as unfit to drive. The results of the current 
study would arguably support extending a future revision of that 
statement to include drivers who have slept for less than 4 hr 
and possibly drivers who have slept for 4 hr as well.
Limitations
This study has several limitations that should be noted. 
Nonculpable drivers might not actually comprise a representa-
tive sample of all drivers present where crashes occur [39]. Sleep 
deprivation might impair drivers’ crash avoidance skills and 
thus increase their risk of involvement as nonculpable drivers 
in crashes that they might have otherwise avoided altogether. 
If sleep deprivation were more common among nonculpable 
drivers involved in crashes than among drivers not involved in 
crashes, this would cause the current study to underestimate 
the impact of sleep deprivation on crash risk (i.e. bias the ORs 
toward the null). Bias away from the null would imply that sleep 
deprivation enhances drivers’ crash avoidance skills, which is 
improbable.
Data on sleep were self-reported and might be biased if 
drivers exaggerated the amount that they slept to avoid impli-
cating themselves in a behavior that might be construed as 
negligent. If culpable and nonculpable drivers were equally 
likely to exaggerate their sleep, the main results would 
overestimate the impact of sleep deprivation, but would be 
expected to preserve the correct general pattern of the asso-
ciation. If exaggeration of sleep was more common among 
nonculpable drivers than among culpable drivers—a counter-
intuitive scenario—the main results would overestimate the 
impact of sleep deprivation. If exaggeration of sleep were more 
common among culpable drivers than among nonculpable 
drivers—arguably the most likely scenario—the main results 
would underestimate the impact of sleep deprivation (with 
the exception of possible marginal overestimation of the OR 
for drivers who slept <4 hr).
The data analyzed for the current study excluded crashes 
that occurred between midnight and 5:59 am, precisely the 
hours during which both the prevalence [5, 35] and the impact 
[7] of driving while sleep-deprived would be expected to be the 
greatest. The estimated impact of sleep deprivation on the risk of 
culpable crash involvement likely would have been even greater 
had the study included data from early-morning crashes.
The majority of drivers in the source data were not tested 
for alcohol nor drugs. Removal from the analysis of drivers who 
police affirmatively reported to have consumed alcohol or illegal

 drugs had minimal impact on the main study results; however, 
it is possible that some drivers were under the influence of alco-
hol or drugs that went undetected. If undetected drug and/or 
alcohol use were disproportionately among culpable drivers 
who reported little sleep, the results could overestimate the 
effect of sleep deprivation on culpable crash involvement.
The study included too few fatal crashes to estimate the 
effects of sleep deprivation on fatal crashes; thus, the results 
of the current study should not be generalized to fatal crashes.
Conclusion
The findings of this study could be used to educate drivers 
about the nature of the relationship between sleep deprivation 
and the risk of causing a crash, for which purpose comparison 
to the crash risk associated with driving after drinking alcohol 
may be instructive given its familiarity. Drivers who reported 
having slept for 5, 4, and less than 4 hr in the past 24 hr had 
crash risks similar to those estimated in a large case–control 
study by the US DOT [37] for drivers with BACs of roughly 0.03, 
0.05, and 0.12 g/dL, respectively, after accounting for differences 
in study design [18]. A small number of countries including 
Japan prohibit driving at BACs greater than or equal to 0.03 g/
dL; many countries including most of Western Europe prohibit 
driving at BACs greater than or equal to 0.05; the United States 
prohibits driving at BACs greater than or equal to 0.08 [40]. 
Finally, it is important for drivers to be aware that falling asleep 
at the wheel is not the only risk associated with acute sleep 
deprivation.
