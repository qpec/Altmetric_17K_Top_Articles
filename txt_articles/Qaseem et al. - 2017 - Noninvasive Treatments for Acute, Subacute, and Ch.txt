 Noninvasive Treatments for Acute, Subacute, and Chronic Low Back
Pain: A Clinical Practice Guideline From the American College of
Physicians
Amir Qaseem, MD, PhD, MHA; Timothy J. Wilt, MD, MPH; Robert M. McLean, MD; and Mary Ann Forciea, MD; for the Clinical
Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians*
Description: The American College of Physicians (ACP) devel-
oped this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical
recommendations on noninvasive treatment of low back pain.
Methods: Using the ACP grading system, the committee based
these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized,
controlled trials and systematic reviews published through April
2015 on noninvasive pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic
treatments for low back pain. Updated searches were performed
through November 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included
reduction or elimination of low back pain, improvement in back-
specific and overall function, improvement in health-related
quality of life, reduction in work disability and return to work,
global improvement, number of back pain episodes or time be-
tween episodes, patient satisfaction, and adverse effects.
Target Audience and Patient Population: The target audi-
ence for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target pa-
tient population includes adults with acute, subacute, or chronic
low back pain.
Recommendation 1: Given that most patients with acute or
subacute low back pain improve over time regardless of treat-
ment, clinicians and patients should select nonpharmacologic
treatment with superficial heat (moderate-quality evidence), mas-
sage, acupuncture, or spinal manipulation (low-quality evidence).
If pharmacologic treatment is desired, clinicians and patients
should select nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or skeletal
muscle relaxants (moderate-quality evidence). (Grade: strong
recommendation)
Recommendation 2: For patients with chronic low back pain,
clinicians and patients should initially select nonpharmacologic
treatment with exercise, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, acupunc-
ture, mindfulness-based stress reduction (moderate-quality evi-
dence), tai chi, yoga, motor control exercise, progressive
relaxation,
electromyography
biofeedback,
low-level
laser
therapy, operant therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, or
spinal
manipulation
(low-quality
evidence).
(Grade:
strong
recommendation)
Recommendation 3: In patients with chronic low back pain who
have had an inadequate response to nonpharmacologic therapy,
clinicians and patients should consider pharmacologic treatment
with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as first-line therapy, or
tramadol or duloxetine as second-line therapy. Clinicians should
only consider opioids as an option in patients who have failed the
aforementioned treatments and only if the potential benefits out-
weigh the risks for individual patients and after a discussion of
known risks and realistic benefits with patients. (Grade: weak rec-
ommendation, moderate-quality evidence)

L
ow back pain is one of the most common reasons
for physician visits in the United States. Most Amer-
icans have experienced low back pain, and approxi-
mately one quarter of U.S. adults reported having low
back pain lasting at least 1 day in the past 3 months (1).
Low back pain is associated with high costs, including
those related to health care and indirect costs from
missed work or reduced productivity (2). The total costs
attributable to low back pain in the United States were
estimated at $100 billion in 2006, two thirds of which
were indirect costs of lost wages and productivity (3).
Low back pain is frequently classified and treated
on the basis of symptom duration, potential cause,
presence or absence of radicular symptoms, and corre-
sponding anatomical or radiographic abnormalities.
Acute back pain is defined as lasting less than 4 weeks,
subacute back pain lasts 4 to 12 weeks, and chronic
back pain lasts more than 12 weeks. Radicular low back
pain results in lower extremity pain, paresthesia, and/or

 weakness and is a result of nerve root impingement.
Most patients with acute back pain have self-limited ep-
isodes that resolve on their own; many do not seek
medical care (4). For patients who do seek medical
care, pain, disability, and return to work typically im-
prove rapidly in the first month (5). However, up to one
third of patients report persistent back pain of at least
moderate intensity 1 year after an acute episode, and 1
in 5 report substantial limitations in activity (6). Many
noninvasive treatment options are available for radicu-
lar and nonradicular low back pain, including pharma-
cologic and nonpharmacologic interventions.
GUIDELINE FOCUS AND TARGET POPULATION
The purpose of this American College of Physicians
(ACP) guideline is to provide treatment guidance
based on the efficacy, comparative effectiveness, and
safety of noninvasive pharmacologic and nonpharma-
cologic treatments for acute (<4 weeks), subacute (4 to
12 weeks), and chronic (>12 weeks) low back pain in
primary care. This guideline does not address topical
pharmacologic therapies or epidural injection thera-
pies. It serves as a partial update of the 2007 ACP
guideline (it excludes evidence on diagnosis). These
recommendations are based on 2 background evi-
dence reviews (7, 8) and a systematic review sponsored
by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
(AHRQ) (9). The target audience for this guideline in-
cludes all clinicians, and the target patient population
includes adults with acute, subacute, or chronic low
back pain.
METHODS
Systematic Review of the Evidence
The
evidence
review
was
conducted
by
the
AHRQ'
s Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice
Center.
Additional
methodological
details
can
be
found in the Appendix (available at Annals.org) as well
as in the accompanying articles (7, 8) and full report (9).
Reviewers searched several databases for studies pub-
lished in English from January 2008 through April 2015
and updated the search through November 2016.
Studies published before 2007 were identified using
the 2007 ACP/American Pain Society (APS) systematic
reviews (10, 11). Reviewers combined data when pos-
sible using meta-analysis and assessed risk of bias and
study quality according to established methods. The
study population included adults (aged ≥18 years) with
acute, subacute, or chronic nonradicular low back pain,
radicular low back pain, or symptomatic spinal stenosis.
The review evaluated pharmacologic (acetamino-
phen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs],
opioids, skeletal muscle relaxants [SMRs], benzodiaz-
epines, antidepressants, antiseizure medications, and
systemic corticosteroids) and nonpharmacologic (psy-
chological therapies, multidisciplinary rehabilitation,
spinal manipulation, acupuncture, massage, exercise
and related therapies, and various physical modalities)
treatments for low back pain. Evaluated outcomes in-
cluded reduction or elimination of low back pain,
improvement in back-specific and overall function,
improvement
in
health-related
quality
of
life,
reduction in work disability, return to work, global
improvement, number of back pain episodes or time
between episodes, patient satisfaction, and adverse
effects.
The magnitude of effect (small, moderate, or large)
was determined as previously described (10, 11). A
small effect on pain was defined as a mean between-
group difference after treatment of 5 to 10 points on a
visual analogue scale of 0 to 100 or equivalent, a mean
between-group difference of 0.5 to 1.0 point on a nu-
merical rating scale of 0 to 10, or a standardized mean
difference of 0.2 to 0.5. A moderate effect was defined
as a mean between-group difference of greater than 10
to no more than 20 points on a visual analogue scale of
0 to 100 or equivalent, a mean between-group differ-
ence of greater than 1.0 to no more than 2.0 points on
a numerical rating scale of 0 to 10 or equivalent, or a
standardized mean difference greater than 0.5 but no
more than 0.8. For function, a small effect was defined
as a mean between-group difference of 5 to 10 points
on
the
Oswestry
Disability
Index
(ODI),
a
mean
between-group difference of 1 to 2 points on the Ro-
land Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ), or a stan-
dardized mean difference of 0.2 to 0.5. A moderate
effect on function was defined as a mean between-
group difference of greater than 10 to no more than 20
points on the ODI, a mean between-group difference
of greater than 2 to no more than 5 points on the RDQ,
or a standardized mean difference greater than 0.5 but
no more than 0.8. No large effects were found with any
intervention.

BENEFITS AND COMPARATIVE BENEFITS OF
PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES
Acute or Subacute Low Back Pain
Appendix Table 1 (available at Annals.org) summa-
rizes the findings for all therapies for acute or subacute
low back pain.
Acetaminophen
Low-quality evidence showed no difference be-
tween acetaminophen and placebo for pain intensity or
function through 4 weeks or between acetaminophen
and NSAIDs for pain intensity or likelihood of experi-
encing global improvement at 3 weeks or earlier (13,
14).
NSAIDs
Moderate-quality evidence showed that NSAIDs
were associated with a small improvement in pain in-
tensity compared with placebo (14, 15), although sev-
eral randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) showed no dif-
ference in likelihood of achieving pain relief with
NSAIDs compared with placebo (16–18). Low-quality
evidence showed a small increase in function with
NSAIDs compared with placebo (19). Moderate-quality
evidence showed that most head-to-head trials of one
NSAID versus another showed no differences in pain
relief in patients with acute low back pain (14). Low-
quality evidence showed no differences in pain be-
tween cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–selective NSAIDs ver-
sus traditional NSAIDs (14).
SMRs
Moderate-quality evidence showed that SMRs im-
proved short-term pain relief compared with placebo
after 2 to 4 and 5 to 7 days (20, 21). Low-quality evi-
dence showed no differences between different SMRs
for any outcomes in patients with acute pain (20). Low-
quality evidence showed inconsistent findings for the
effect on pain intensity with a combination of SMRs
plus NSAIDs compared with NSAIDs alone (20, 22, 23).
Systemic Corticosteroids
Low-quality evidence showed no difference in pain
or function between a single intramuscular injection of
methylprednisolone or a 5-day course of prednisolone
compared with placebo in patients with acute low back
pain (24, 25).
Other Therapies
Evidence was insufficient to determine effective-
ness of antidepressants, benzodiazepines (26, 27), an-
tiseizure medications, or opioids versus placebo in pa-
tients with acute or subacute low back pain.
Chronic Low Back Pain
Appendix Table 2 (available at Annals.org) summa-
rizes the findings for all therapies for chronic low back
pain.
NSAIDs
Moderate-quality evidence showed that NSAIDs
were associated with small to moderate pain improve-
ment compared with placebo (14, 28, 29). Low-quality
evidence showed that NSAIDs were associated with no
to small improvement in function (28–31). Moderate-
quality evidence showed that most head-to-head trials
of one NSAID versus another showed no differences
in
pain
relief
in
patients
with
chronic
low
back
pain (14). There were no data on COX-2–selective
NSAIDs.
Opioids
Moderate-quality evidence showed that strong opi-
oids (tapentadol, morphine, hydromorphone, and oxy-
morphone) were associated with a small short-term im-
provement in pain scores (about 1 point on a pain scale
of 0 to 10) and function compared with placebo (32–
36). Low-quality evidence showed that buprenorphine
patches improved short-term pain more than placebo
in patients with chronic low back pain; however, the
improvement corresponded to less than 1 point on a
pain scale of 0 to 10 (37–40). Moderate-quality evi-
dence showed no differences among different long-
acting opioids for pain or function (33, 41–44), and low-
quality evidence showed no clear differences in pain
relief between long- and short-acting opioids (45–50).
Moderate-quality
evidence
showed
that
tramadol
achieved moderate short-term pain relief and a small
improvement in function compared with placebo (32,
51, 52).
SMRs
Evidence comparing SMRs versus placebo was in-
sufficient (53–55). Low-quality evidence showed no dif-
ferences in any outcome between different SMRs for
treatment of chronic low back pain (20).
Benzodiazepines
Low-quality evidence showed that tetrazepam im-
proved pain relief at 5 to 7 days and resulted in overall

 improvement at 10 to 14 days compared with placebo
(20).
Antidepressants
Moderate-quality evidence showed no difference
in pain between tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or se-
lective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus pla-
cebo, and low-quality evidence showed no differences
in function for antidepressants (56). Moderate-quality
evidence showed that duloxetine was associated with a
small improvement in pain intensity and function com-
pared with placebo (57–59).
Other Therapies
Evidence was insufficient to determine the effect of
acetaminophen, systemic corticosteroids, or antiseizure
medications on chronic low back pain.
Radicular Low Back Pain
Appendix Table 3 (available at Annals.org) summa-
rizes the findings for all treatments for radicular low
back pain.
Benzodiazepines
Low-quality evidence showed no difference be-
tween diazepam and placebo for function at 1 week
through 1 year and analgesic use, return to work, or
likelihood of surgery through 1 year of follow-up in pa-
tients with acute or subacute radicular pain (60). Diaze-
pam resulted in a lower likelihood of pain improvement
at 1 week compared with placebo.
Systemic Corticosteroids
Moderate-quality evidence showed no differences
in pain between systemic corticosteroids and placebo
and no to small effect on function in patients with radic-
ular low back pain (61–66).
Other Therapies
No RCTs evaluated acetaminophen, SMRs, antide-
pressants, or opioids for radicular low back pain. Re-
sults for NSAIDs were inconsistent for pain, and
evidence was therefore insufficient (22). There was in-
sufficient evidence to determine the effect of antisei-
zure medications on radicular low back pain (67–71).
HARMS OF PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES
Harms were derived from the identified systematic
reviews. Adverse effects generally associated with the
drugs can be found in Appendix Table 4 (available at
Annals.org).
Moderate-quality evidence showed no difference
among
scheduled
acetaminophen,
acetaminophen
taken as needed, or placebo for serious adverse events
(13). Moderate-quality evidence showed that more ad-
verse effects occurred with NSAIDs than placebo, COX-
2–selective NSAIDs were associated with a decreased
risk for adverse effects compared with traditional
NSAIDs, and acetaminophen was associated with a
lower
risk
for
adverse
effects
than
NSAIDs
(14).
Moderate-quality evidence showed that short-term use
of opioids increased nausea, dizziness, constipation,
vomiting, somnolence, and dry mouth compared with
placebo, and SMRs increased risk for any adverse event
and central nervous system adverse events (mostly se-
dation) compared with placebo (20). Moderate-quality
evidence showed that antidepressants increased risk
for any adverse event compared with placebo, al-
though rates of specific adverse events did not differ
(72). The risk for serious adverse events did not differ
between duloxetine and placebo, although duloxetine
was associated with increased risk for withdrawal due
to
adverse
events
(57–59).
Low-quality
evidence
showed no clear differences in adverse effects for ga-
bapentin versus placebo (67, 68). Low-quality evidence
showed that benzodiazepines caused more frequent
somnolence, fatigue, and lightheadedness than pla-
cebo (20). Harms were not well-reported, and no RCTs
assessed long-term use of benzodiazepines or risks for
addiction, abuse, or overdose. Adverse events for sys-
temic corticosteroids were not well-reported in RCTs,
but the largest trial found that oral prednisone was as-
sociated with increased risk for any adverse event,
insomnia, nervousness, and increased appetite (66).
However, low-quality evidence showed no cases of hy-
perglycemia that required medical attention (24, 61,
64).
COMPARATIVE BENEFITS OF
NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES
Acute or Subacute Low Back Pain
Exercise
Low-quality evidence showed no difference be-
tween exercise therapy and usual care for pain or func-
tion in patients with acute or subacute pain (11); addi-
tional
trials
reported
inconsistent
results
(73–75).
Moderate-quality evidence showed no clear differ-
ences between different exercise regimens in more
than 20 head-to-head RCTs in patients with acute low
back pain.
Acupuncture
Low-quality evidence showed that acupuncture re-
sulted in a small decrease in pain intensity compared
with sham acupuncture with nonpenetrating needles,
but there were no clear effects on function (76–78).
Low-quality evidence showed that acupuncture slightly
increased the likelihood of overall improvement com-
pared with NSAIDs (76, 79–83).
Massage
Low-quality evidence showed that massage mod-
erately improved short-term (1 week) pain and function
compared with sham therapy for subacute low back
pain (84), although 1 trial (85) showed no difference in
pain or function at 5 weeks. Moderate-quality evidence
showed that massage improved short-term pain relief

 and function compared with other interventions (ma-
nipulation, exercise therapy, relaxation therapy, acu-
puncture, or physiotherapy) for patients with subacute
to chronic low back pain, but effects were small (84,
86). Low-quality evidence showed that a combination
of massage plus another intervention (exercise, exer-
cise and education, or usual care) was superior to the
other intervention alone for short-term pain in patients
with subacute to chronic low back pain (84).
Spinal Manipulation
Low-quality evidence showed that spinal manipula-
tion was associated with a small effect on function
compared with sham manipulation; evidence was insuf-
ficient to determine the effect on pain (87, 88). Low-
quality evidence showed no difference in pain relief at
1 week between spinal manipulation and inert treat-
ment (educational booklet, detuned ultrasound, de-
tuned or actual short-wave diathermy, antiedema gel,
or bed rest), although 1 trial showed better longer-term
pain relief (3 months) with spinal manipulation (89).
Function did not differ between spinal manipulation
and inert treatment at 1 week or 3 months (89).
Moderate-quality evidence showed no difference be-
tween spinal manipulation and other active interven-
tions for pain relief at 1 week through 1 year or function
(analyses included exercise, physical therapy, or back
school as the comparator) (89, 90). Low-quality evi-
dence showed that a combination of spinal manipula-
tion plus exercise or advice slightly improved function
at 1 week compared with exercise or advice alone, but
these differences were not present at 1 or 3 months
(89).
Superficial Heat
Moderate-quality evidence showed that a heat
wrap moderately improved pain relief (at 5 days) and
disability (at 4 days) compared with placebo (91). Low-
quality evidence showed that a combination of heat
plus exercise provided greater pain relief and im-
proved RDQ scores at 7 days compared with exercise
alone in patients with acute pain (92). Low-quality evi-
dence showed that a heat wrap provided more effec-
tive pain relief and improved RDQ scores compared
with acetaminophen or ibuprofen after 1 to 2 days (93).
Low-quality evidence showed no clear differences be-
tween a heat wrap and exercise in pain relief or func-
tion (92).
Low-Level Laser Therapy
Low-quality evidence showed that a combination
of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) and NSAIDs largely de-
creased pain intensity and resulted in a moderate im-
provement in function (as measured by the ODI) com-
pared with sham laser therapy plus NSAIDs in patients
with acute or subacute pain (94).
Lumbar Supports
Low-quality evidence showed no difference in pain
or function between lumbar supports added to an ed-
ucational program compared with an educational pro-
gram alone or other active interventions in patients with
acute or subacute low back pain (95).
Other Therapies
Evidence was insufficient to determine the effec-
tiveness of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
(TENS), electrical muscle stimulation, inferential ther-
apy, short-wave diathermy, traction, superficial cold,
motor control exercise (MCE), Pilates, tai chi, yoga, psy-
chological therapies, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, ul-
trasound, and taping.
Chronic Low Back Pain
Exercise
Moderate-quality evidence showed that exercise
resulted in a small improvement in pain relief and func-
tion compared with no exercise (11, 96). Moderate-
quality evidence showed that compared with usual
care, exercise resulted in small improvements in pain
intensity and function at the end of treatment, although
effects
were
smaller
at
long-term
follow-up
(96).
Moderate-quality evidence showed no clear differ-
ences between different exercise regimens in more
than 20 head-to-head RCTs in patients with chronic low
back pain.
MCE
Motor control exercise focuses on restoring coordi-
nation, control, and strength of the muscles that control
and support the spine. Low-quality evidence showed
that MCE moderately decreased pain scores and
slightly
improved
function
in
short-
to
long-term
follow-up compared with a minimal intervention (97).
Low-quality evidence showed that MCE resulted in
small improvements in pain intensity at short-term (≥6
weeks to <4 months) and intermediate-term (≥4 to <8
months) follow-up compared with general exercise, al-
though improvements were small and no longer signif-
icant at long-term follow-up (97). Motor control exer-
cise also resulted in small improvements in function in
the short and long term (97). Low-quality evidence
showed that MCE resulted in a moderate improvement
in pain intensity and function compared with multi-
modal physical therapy at intermediate follow-up (97).
Low-quality evidence showed no clear differences in
pain with a combination of MCE plus exercise versus
exercise alone (98, 99).
Pilates
Low-quality evidence showed that Pilates resulted
in small or no clear effects on pain and no clear effects
on function compared with usual care plus physical ac-
tivity (100–107). Low-quality evidence showed no clear
differences between Pilates and other types of exercise
for pain or function (108–110).

 Tai Chi
Low-quality evidence showed that tai chi resulted
in moderate pain improvement compared with wait-list
controls or no tai chi (111, 112), and 1 study showed a
small increase in function (111). Moderate-quality evi-
dence showed that tai chi moderately decreased pain
intensity at 3 and 6 months compared with backward
walking or jogging but not versus swimming (112).
Yoga
Low-quality evidence showed that Iyengar yoga re-
sulted in moderately lower pain scores and improved
function compared with usual care at 24 weeks (113).
Low-quality evidence showed that yoga resulted in a
small decrease in pain intensity compared with exercise
(114–118). Low-quality evidence showed that, com-
pared with education, yoga resulted in a small de-
crease in short-term (≤12 weeks) but not long-term
(about 1 year) pain intensity and a small increase in
short- and long-term function (119).
Psychological Therapies
Low-quality evidence showed that progressive re-
laxation therapy moderately improved pain intensity
and functional status compared with wait-list controls
(120). Low-quality evidence showed that electromyog-
raphy biofeedback training moderately decreased pain
intensity (reduction of 5 to 13 points on a 100-point
pain scale) compared with wait-list controls, but there
was no effect on function (120). Low-quality evidence
showed that operant therapy (behavioral therapy in-
volving reinforcement) slightly improved pain intensity
compared with wait-list control, although there was no
difference for function (120). Low-quality evidence
showed that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and
other combined psychological therapies (involving ed-
ucation, problem-solving training, coping techniques,
imagery, relaxation, goal setting, cognitive pain control,
and exercises) were associated with moderately im-
proved pain intensity compared with wait-list controls,
but
there
was
no
difference
in
function
(120).
Moderate-quality evidence showed that mindfulness-
based stress reduction is an effective treatment for
chronic low back pain. One study showed a small im-
provement in pain at 26 and 52 weeks and in function
at 26 weeks compared with usual care (121). The same
study showed no difference between mindfulness-
based stress reduction and CBT for improvements in
pain or function. Two other studies showed improve-
ment in pain and function compared with education
(122, 123). Low-quality evidence showed no difference
between psychological therapies and exercise or phys-
ical therapy for pain intensity (120). Low-quality evi-
dence showed no differences in pain or function be-
tween a combination of psychological therapy plus
exercise or physiotherapy compared with exercise or
physiotherapy alone (120). Moderate-quality evidence
showed no differences between different psychological
therapies for pain or function outcomes (120).
Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation
Moderate-quality evidence showed that multidisci-
plinary rehabilitation moderately reduced short-term
(<3 months) and slightly reduced long-term pain inten-
sity and disability compared with usual care, although
there was no difference in return to work (124). Low-
quality evidence showed that multidisciplinary rehabil-
itation was associated with moderately lower short-
term pain intensity and slightly lower disability than no
rehabilitation (124). Moderate-quality evidence showed
that multidisciplinary rehabilitation was associated with
slightly lower short-term pain intensity and disability,
moderately lower long-term pain intensity, and im-
proved function compared with physical therapy and a
greater likelihood of returning to work compared with
nonmultidisciplinary rehabilitation (124).
Acupuncture
Low-quality evidence showed that acupuncture
was associated with moderate improvement in pain re-
lief immediately after treatment and up to 12 weeks
later compared with sham acupuncture, but there was
no improvement in function (125–130). Moderate-
quality evidence showed that acupuncture was associ-
ated with moderately lower pain intensity and im-
proved function compared with no acupuncture at the
end of treatment (125). Low-quality evidence showed a
small improvement in pain relief and function com-
pared with medications (NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, or
analgesics) (125).
Massage
Low-quality evidence showed no difference in pain
between foot reflexology and usual care for patients
with chronic low back pain (131–133). Moderate-quality
evidence showed that massage improved short-term
pain relief and function compared with other interven-
tions (manipulation, exercise therapy, relaxation ther-
apy, acupuncture, physiotherapy, or TENS) for patients
with subacute to chronic low back pain, although ef-
fects were small (84, 86). Low-quality evidence showed
that a combination of massage plus another interven-
tion (exercise, exercise and education, or usual care)
was superior to the other intervention alone for short-
term pain in patients with subacute to chronic low back
pain (84).
Spinal Manipulation
Low-quality evidence showed no difference in pain
with spinal manipulation versus sham manipulation at 1
month (134, 135). Low-quality evidence showed that
spinal manipulation slightly improved pain compared
with an inert treatment (136–142). Moderate-quality ev-
idence showed no clear differences in pain or function
compared with another active intervention. Low-quality
evidence showed that a combination of spinal manipu-
lation with another active treatment resulted in greater
pain relief and improved function at 1, 3, and 12

 months compared with the other treatment alone (134,
143–147).
Ultrasound
Low-quality evidence showed no difference be-
tween ultrasound and sham ultrasound for pain at the
end of treatment or 4 weeks after treatment (148–150).
Low-quality evidence showed no difference between
ultrasound and no ultrasound for pain or function (151,
152).
TENS
Low-quality evidence showed no difference be-
tween TENS and sham TENS for pain intensity or func-
tion at short-term follow-up (153). Low-quality evidence
showed no difference between TENS and acupuncture
in short- or long-term pain (154).
LLLT
Low-quality evidence showed that LLLT slightly im-
proved pain compared with sham laser (155–157), and
1 RCT (155) showed that LLLT slightly improved func-
tion compared with sham laser.
Lumbar Support
Evidence was insufficient to compare lumbar sup-
port versus no lumbar support. Low-quality evidence
showed no difference between a lumbar support plus
exercise (muscle strengthening) versus exercise alone
for pain or function at 8 weeks or 6 months (158). Low-
quality evidence showed no clear differences between
lumbar supports and other active treatments (traction,
spinal manipulation, exercise, physiotherapy, or TENS)
for pain or function (159–161).
Taping
Low-quality evidence showed no differences be-
tween Kinesio taping and sham taping for back-specific
function after 5 or 12 weeks, although effects on pain
were inconsistent between the 2 trials (162, 163). Low-
quality evidence showed no differences between Kine-
sio taping and exercise for pain or function (164, 165).
Other Therapies
Evidence was insufficient to determine the effec-
tiveness of electrical muscle stimulation, interferential
therapy, short-wave diathermy, traction, or superficial
heat or cold.
Radicular Low Back Pain
Exercise
Low-quality evidence showed that exercise re-
sulted in small improvements in pain and function com-
pared with usual care or no exercise (166–168).
Traction
Low-quality evidence showed no clear differences
between traction and other active treatments, between
traction
plus
physiotherapy
versus
physiotherapy
alone, or between different types of traction in patients
with low back pain with or without radiculopathy (169).
Other Therapies
Evidence was insufficient for ultrasound, MCE,
Pilates, tai chi, yoga, psychological therapies, multidis-
ciplinary rehabilitation, acupuncture, massage, spinal
manipulation, LLLT, electrical muscle stimulation, short-
wave diathermy, TENS, interferential therapy, superfi-
cial heat or cold, lumbar support, and taping.
HARMS OF NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES
Evidence on adverse events from the included
RCTs and systematic reviews was limited, and the qual-
ity of evidence for all available harms data is low. Harms
were poorly reported (if they were reported at all) for
most of the interventions.
Low-quality evidence showed no reported harms
or serious adverse events associated with tai chi, psy-
chological interventions, multidisciplinary rehabilita-
tion, ultrasound, acupuncture, lumbar support, or trac-
tion
(9,
95,
150,
170–174).
Low-quality
evidence
showed that when harms were reported for exercise,
they were often related to muscle soreness and in-
creased pain, and no serious harms were reported. All
reported harms associated with yoga were mild to
moderate (119). Low-quality evidence showed that
none of the RCTs reported any serious adverse events
with massage, although 2 RCTs reported soreness dur-
ing or after massage therapy (175, 176). Adverse
events associated with spinal manipulation included
muscle soreness or transient increases in pain (134).
There were few adverse events reported and no clear
differences between MCE and controls. Transcutane-
ous electrical nerve stimulation was associated with an
increased risk for skin site reaction but not serious ad-
verse events (177). Two RCTs (178, 179) showed an
increased risk for skin flushing with heat compared with
no heat or placebo, and no serious adverse events
were reported. There were no data on cold therapy.
Evidence was insufficient to determine harms of electri-
cal muscle stimulation, LLLT, percutaneous electrical
nerve stimulation, interferential therapy, short-wave
diathermy, and taping.
COMPARISON OF CONCLUSIONS WITH THOSE
OF THE 2007 GUIDELINE
Some evidence has changed since the 2007 ACP
guideline and supporting evidence review. The 2007
review concluded that acetaminophen was effective for
acute low back pain, based on indirect evidence from
trials of acetaminophen for other conditions and trials
of acetaminophen versus other analgesics. However,
this update included a placebo-controlled RCT in pa-
tients with low back pain that showed no difference in
effectiveness between acetaminophen and placebo
(low-quality evidence). In addition, contrary to the 2007

 review, current moderate-quality evidence showed that
TCAs were not effective for chronic low back pain com-
pared with placebo. Additional pharmacologic treat-
ments addressed in the current review included dulox-
etine and the antiseizure medication pregabalin. Many
conclusions about nonpharmacologic interventions are
similar between the 2007 review and the update. Addi-
tional modalities assessed (with at least low-quality ev-
idence) include mindfulness-based stress reduction,
MCE, taping, and tai chi. Additional evidence or
changes from the updated review include that superfi-
cial heat was found to be more effective for acute or
subacute low back pain (moderate-quality evidence)
and neither ultrasound nor TENS was shown to be ef-
fective compared with controls (low-quality evidence).
The Figure summarizes the recommendations and
clinical considerations. Additional details on the evi-
dence are available in Appendix Tables 1 to 4 and the
accompanying evidence reviews (7, 8).
RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation 1: Given that most patients with
acute or subacute low back pain improve over time re-
gardless of treatment, clinicians and patients should se-
lect nonpharmacologic treatment with superficial heat
(moderate-quality evidence), massage, acupuncture, or
spinal manipulation (low-quality evidence). If pharmaco-
logic treatment is desired, clinicians and patients should
select nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or skeletal
muscle relaxants (moderate-quality evidence). (Grade:
strong recommendation)
Clinicians should inform all patients of the gener-
ally favorable prognosis of acute low back pain with or
without sciatica, including a high likelihood for substan-
tial improvement in the first month (5, 180). Clinicians
should also provide patients with evidence-based infor-
mation with regard to their expected course, advise
them to remain active as tolerated, and provide infor-
mation about effective self-care options. Clinicians and
patients should use a shared decision-making ap-
proach to select the most appropriate treatment based
on patient preferences, availability, harms, and costs of
the
interventions.
Nonpharmacologic
interventions
shown to be effective for improving pain and function
in patients with acute or subacute low back pain in-
clude superficial heat (moderate-quality evidence and
moderate improvement in pain and function) and mas-
sage (low-quality evidence and small to moderate im-
provement in pain and function). Low-quality evidence
showed that acupuncture had a small effect on improv-
ing pain and spinal manipulation had a small effect on
improving function compared with sham manipulation
but not inert treatment. Harms of nonpharmacologic
interventions were sparsely reported, and no serious
adverse events were reported. Superficial heat was as-
sociated with increased risk for skin flushing, and mas-
sage and spinal manipulation were associated with
muscle soreness.
We recommend that the choice between NSAIDs
and SMRs be individualized on the basis of patient pref-
erences and likely individual medication risk profile.
Treatment with NSAIDs resulted in a small improve-
ment in both pain intensity (moderate-quality evidence)
and function (low-quality evidence), and treatment with
SMRs resulted in a small improvement in pain relief
(moderate-quality evidence). There was no evidence
for the effect of SMRs on function. Nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs are associated with gastrointestinal
and renal risks. Clinicians should therefore assess reno-
vascular and gastrointestinal risk factors before pre-
scribing NSAIDs and recommend the lowest effective
doses for the shortest periods necessary. Although they
are associated with lower risk for adverse effects than
nonselective NSAIDs, COX-2–selective NSAIDs were
not assessed for improvement in pain or function. Skel-
etal muscle relaxants are associated with central ner-
vous system adverse effects, especially sedation.
The updated evidence showed that acetamino-
phen was not effective at improving pain outcomes ver-
sus placebo. However, this study assessed pain at 3
weeks after the intervention, and evidence from head-
to-head trials showed no difference between acetamin-
ophen and NSAIDs. Low-quality evidence showed that
systemic steroids were not effective in treating acute or
subacute low back pain, and we recommend against
these drugs for treatment of acute low back pain.
Recommendation 2: For patients with chronic low
back pain, clinicians and patients should initially select
nonpharmacologic treatment with exercise, multidisci-
plinary rehabilitation, acupuncture, mindfulness-based
stress reduction (moderate-quality evidence), tai chi,
yoga, motor control exercise, progressive relaxation,
electromyography biofeedback, low-level laser therapy,
operant therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, or spinal
manipulation (low-quality evidence). (Grade: strong
recommendation)
Nonpharmacologic interventions are considered as
first-line options in patients with chronic low back pain
because fewer harms are associated with these types of
therapies than with pharmacologic options. It is impor-
tant that physical therapies be administered by provid-
ers with appropriate training. Moderate-quality evi-
dence showed that exercise therapy resulted in small
improvements in pain and function. Specific compo-
nents associated with greater effects on pain included
individually designed programs, supervised home ex-
ercise, and group exercise; regimens that included
stretching and strength training were most effective.
Moderate-quality evidence showed that, compared
with usual care, multidisciplinary rehabilitation resulted
in moderate pain improvement in the short term (<3
months), small pain improvement in the long term, and
small improvement in function in both the short and
long term. Low-quality evidence showed that multidis-
ciplinary rehabilitation resulted in a moderate improve-
ment in pain and a small improvement in function
compared with no multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Acu-
puncture had a moderate effect on pain and function
compared with no acupuncture (moderate-quality evi-

 dence) and a moderate effect on pain with no clear
effect on function compared with sham acupuncture
(low-quality
evidence).
Moderate-quality
evidence
showed that mindfulness-based stress reduction re-
sulted in small improvements in pain and function
(small effect), and 1 study showed that it was equivalent
to CBT for improving back pain and function.
Low-quality evidence showed that tai chi had a
moderate effect on pain and a small effect on function.
Tai chi sessions in included studies lasted 40 to 45 min-
utes and were done 2 to 5 times per week for 10 to 24
weeks. Low-quality evidence showed that yoga im-
proved pain and function by a moderate amount com-
pared with usual care and by a small amount compared
with education. Low-quality evidence showed that MCE
had a moderate effect on pain and a small effect on
function. Motor control exercise, tai chi, and yoga were
favored over general exercise (low-quality evidence).
Low-quality evidence showed that progressive re-
laxation had a moderate effect on pain and function,
electromyography biofeedback and CBT each had a
moderate effect on pain and no effect on function, and
operant therapy had a small effect on pain and no ef-
fect on function. Low-quality evidence showed that
LLLT had a small effect on pain and function. Low-
quality evidence showed that spinal manipulation had a
small effect on pain compared with inert treatment but
no effect compared with sham manipulation. There
were no clear differences between spinal manipulation
and
other
active
interventions
(moderate-quality
evidence).
Harms were poorly reported for nonpharmacologic
therapies, although no serious harms were reported for
any of the recommended interventions. Muscle sore-
ness was reported for exercise, massage, and spinal
manipulation.
Ultrasound, TENS, and Kinesio taping had no effect
on pain or function compared with control treatments
(low-quality evidence).
Recommendation 3: In patients with chronic low
back pain who have had an inadequate response to
nonpharmacologic
therapy,
clinicians
and
patients
should consider pharmacologic treatment with non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as first-line therapy, or
tramadol or duloxetine as second-line therapy. Clini-
cians should only consider opioids as an option in pa-
tients who have failed the aforementioned treatments
and only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks for
individual patients and after a discussion of known risks
and realistic benefits with patients. (Grade: weak recom-
mendation, moderate-quality evidence)
Pharmacologic therapy should be considered for
patients with chronic low back pain who do not im-
prove with nonpharmacologic interventions. Nonsteroi-
dal anti-inflammatory drugs had a small to moderate
effect on pain (moderate-quality evidence) and no to

Recommendations
Recommendation 1: Given that most patients with acute or subacute low back pain improve over time regardless of treatment, 
clinicians and patients should select nonpharmacologic treatment with superficial heat (moderate-quality evidence), massage,
acupuncture, or spinal manipulation (low-quality evidence). If pharmacologic treatment is desired, clinicians and patients 
should select nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or skeletal muscle relaxants (moderate-quality evidence). (Grade: strong 
recommendation)
Recommendation 2: For patients with chronic low back pain, clinicians and patients should initially select nonpharmacologic 
treatment with exercise, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, acupuncture, mindfulness-based stress reduction (moderate-quality 
evidence), tai chi, yoga, motor control exercise, progressive relaxation, electromyography biofeedback, low-level laser therapy, 
operant therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, or spinal manipulation (low-quality evidence). (Grade: strong recommendation)
Recommendation 3: In patients with chronic low back pain who have had an inadequate response to nonpharmacologic 
therapy, clinicians and patients should consider pharmacologic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as 
first-line therapy, or tramadol or duloxetine as second-line therapy. Clinicians should only consider opioids as an option in 
patients who have failed the aforementioned treatments and only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks for individual 
patients and after a discussion of known risks and realistic benefits with patients. (Grade: weak recommendation, 
moderate-quality evidence)
High-Value Care
Clinicians should reassure patients that acute or subacute low back pain usually improves over time regardless of treatment and 
should avoid prescribing costly and potentially harmful treatments. Systemic steroids were not shown to provide benefit and 
should not be prescribed for patients with acute or subacute low back pain, even with radicular symptoms. For treatment of 
chronic low back pain, clinicians should select therapies that have the fewest harms and lowest costs. Clinicians should avoid 
prescribing costly therapies and those with substantial potential harms, such as long-term opioids, and pharmacologic therapies 
that were not shown to be effective, such as tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
Clinical Considerations
Clinicians should inform patients with acute or subacute low back pain of the generally very favorable outcome. Thus, patients can
avoid potentially harmful and costly tests and treatments.
Clinicians should advise patients with acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain to remain active as tolerated.
Improvements in pain and function due to pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions were small and often showed no 
clear differences compared with controls.
Few differences in recommended therapies were found when they were studied in head-to-head trials. Therefore, clinicians should
base treatment recommendations on patient preferences that also minimize harms and costs.
COX-2 = cyclooxygenase-2; LLLT = low-level laser therapy; NSAID = nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; SMR = skeletal muscle relaxant.

 small effect on function (low-quality evidence) and
should be the first option considered. Moderate-quality
evidence showed no difference in pain improvement
when different NSAIDs were compared with one an-
other. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associ-
ated with gastrointestinal and renal risks. Clinicians
should therefore assess renovascular and gastrointesti-
nal risk factors before prescribing NSAIDs and should
recommend the lowest effective doses for the shortest
periods necessary. COX-2–selective NSAIDs were not
assessed for improvement in pain or function, although
they are associated with lower risk for adverse effects
than nonselective NSAIDs.
For second-line therapies, moderate-quality evi-
dence showed that tramadol had a moderate effect on
pain and a small effect on function in the short term. Of
note, tramadol is a narcotic and, like other opioids, is
associated with the risk for abuse (181). Moderate-
quality evidence showed that duloxetine had a small
effect on pain and function.
Moderate-quality evidence showed that opioids
(morphine, oxymorphone, hydromorphone, and tapen-
tadol) had a small effect on short-term pain and func-
tion. Low-quality evidence showed that buprenorphine
(patch or sublingual) resulted in a small improvement in
pain. Opioids should be the last treatment option con-
sidered and should be considered only in patients for
whom other therapies have failed because they are as-
sociated with substantial harms. Moderate-quality evi-
dence showed no difference in pain or function when
different long-acting opioids were compared with one
another. Harms of short-term use of opioids include in-
creased nausea, dizziness, constipation, vomiting, som-
nolence, and dry mouth compared with placebo. Stud-
ies assessing opioids for the treatment of chronic low
back pain did not address the risk for addiction, abuse,
or
overdose,
although
observational
studies
have
shown a dose-dependent relationship between opioid
use for chronic pain and serious harms (182).
Moderate-quality evidence showed that TCAs did
not effectively improve pain or function (low-quality ev-
idence) in patients with chronic low back pain, which is
contrary to the 2007 guideline. In addition, moderate-
quality evidence showed that SSRIs did not improve
pain.
AREAS OF INCONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE
Evidence is insufficient or lacking to determine
treatments for radicular low back pain. Most RCTs en-
rolled a mixture of patients with acute, subacute, and
chronic low back pain, so it is difficult to extrapolate the
benefits of treatment compared with its duration. Use
of opioids for chronic pain is an important area that
requires further research to compare benefits and
harms of therapy. The evidence is also insufficient for
most physical modalities. Evidence is insufficient on
which patients are likely to benefit from which specific
therapy. Evidence on patient-important outcomes, such
as disability or return to work, was largely unavailable,
and available evidence showed no clear connection
with improvements in pain.
HIGH-VALUE CARE
Clinicians should reassure patients that acute or
subacute low back pain usually improves over time, re-
gardless of treatment. Thus, clinicians should avoid pre-
scribing costly and potentially harmful treatments for
these patients, especially narcotics. In addition, sys-
temic steroids were not shown to provide benefit and
should not be prescribed for patients with acute or sub-
acute low back pain, even with radicular symptoms. For
treatment of chronic low back pain, clinicians should
select therapies that have the fewest harms and lowest
costs because there were no clear comparative advan-
tages for most treatments compared with one another.
Clinicians should avoid prescribing costly therapies;
those with substantial potential harms, such as long-
term opioids (which can be associated with addiction
and accidental overdose); and pharmacologic thera-
pies that were not shown to be effective, such as TCAs
and SSRIs.

APPENDIX: DETAILED METHODS
The
evidence
review
was
conducted
by
the
AHRQ'
s Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice
Center. Details of the ACP guideline development pro-
cess can be found in ACP'
s methods paper (12). Disclo-
sures of interests and management of any conflicts can
be found at www.acponline.org/clinical_information
/guidelines/guidelines/conflicts_cgc.htm.
Key Questions Addressed
1. What are the comparative benefits and harms of
different pharmacologic therapies for acute or chronic
nonradicular low back pain, radicular low back pain, or
spinal stenosis, including NSAIDs, acetaminophen, opi-
oids, muscle relaxants, antiseizure medications, antide-
pressants,
corticosteroids,
and
topical
or
patch-
delivered medications?
2. What are the comparative benefits and harms of
different nonpharmacologic, noninvasive therapies for
acute or chronic nonradicular low back pain, radicular
low back pain, or spinal stenosis, including but not lim-
ited to interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise (various
types), physical modalities (ultrasound, TENS, electrical
muscle stimulation, interferential therapy, heat [various
forms], and ice), traction tables/devices, back supports/
bracing, spinal manipulation, various psychological
therapies,
acupuncture,
massage
therapy
(various
types), yoga, magnets, and low-level lasers?
Search Strategy
Reviewers searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Cen-
tral Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Da-
tabase of Systematic Reviews for trials published from
January 2008 through April 2015. Searches were up-
dated through November 2016. Studies published be-
fore 2008 were identified using the 2007 ACP/APS sys-
tematic reviews (10, 11).
Quality Assessment
Randomized trials were evaluated using methods
developed by the Cochrane Back Review Group and
the AHRQ (183), and systematic reviews were assessed
using AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess System-
atic Reviews) (184).
Population Studied
Adults with acute, subacute, or chronic nonradicu-
lar low back pain, radicular low back pain, or symptom-
atic spinal stenosis.
Interventions Evaluated
Oral or topical pharmacologic therapies included
NSAIDs, acetaminophen, opioids, tramadol and tapen-
tadol, antidepressants, SMRs, benzodiazepines, corti-
costeroids, antiepileptic medications, capsaicin, and
lidocaine.
Noninvasive,
nonpharmacologic
therapies
in-
cluded interdisciplinary or multicomponent rehabilita-
tion (physical therapy plus psychological therapy with
some coordination), psychological therapies, exercise
and related interventions (such as yoga or tai chi), com-
plementary and alternative medicine therapies (spinal
manipulation,
acupuncture,
and
massage),
passive
physical modalities (such as heat, cold, ultrasound,
TENS, electrical muscle stimulation, interferential ther-
apy, short-wave diathermy, traction, LLLT, and lumbar
supports/braces), and taping.
Comparators
Interventions were compared with each other or
with placebo (drug trials), sham (functionally inert)
treatments, or no treatment.
Outcomes
Outcomes included reduction or elimination of low
back pain (including related leg symptoms), improve-
ment in back-specific and overall function, improve-
ment in health-related quality of life, reduction in work
disability and return to work, global improvement,
number of back pain episodes or time between epi-
sodes, patient satisfaction, and adverse effects of
interventions.
Timing
Timing of outcomes was stratified as long-term (≥1
year) and short-term (≤6 months).
Setting
Settings included inpatient and outpatient.

 Target Audience
The target audience includes all clinicians.
Target Patient Population
The target patient population includes adults with
acute (<4 weeks), subacute (4 to 12 weeks), or chronic
(>12 weeks) nonradicular low back pain, radicular low
back pain, or symptomatic spinal stenosis. Children or
adolescents with low back pain; pregnant women; and
patients with low back pain from sources outside the
back (nonspinal low back pain), fibromyalgia or other
myofascial pain syndromes, and thoracic or cervical
back pain are not included.
Peer Review
The AHRQ systematic review was sent to invited
peer reviewers and posted on the AHRQ Web site for
public comments. The accompanying evidence reviews
(7, 8) also underwent a peer review process through
the journal. The guideline underwent a peer review
process through the journal and was posted online for
comments from ACP Regents and ACP Governors, who
represent ACP members at the regional level.

 Appendix Table 4. Adverse Events for Treatments for Acute, Chronic, and Radicular Low Back Pain
Interventions
Data on Adverse Events (Quality of Evidence;
Studies)
Adverse Effects
Adverse events reported for
pharmacologic treatments
Acetaminophen
Versus placebo: No difference in risk for serious
adverse events (moderate quality; 1 RCT)
Thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis,
pancytopenia, hemolytic anemia,
methemoglobinemia, hypoglycemia,
hypothermia, pancreatitis, nephrotoxicity,
hepatotoxicity (with overdose), hepatic
necrosis, pneumonitis, rash, and
hypersensitivity
Versus NSAIDs: A systematic review found that
acetaminophen was associated with lower risk for
adverse events; RR, 0.57 (95% CI, 0.36–0.89)
(moderate quality; 3 RCTs)
NSAIDs
Versus placebo: NSAIDs associated with more adverse
effects; RR, 1.35 (CI, 1.09–1.68) (moderate quality;
10 RCTs)
Abdominal pain or cramps, dyspepsia,
diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding,
gastrointestinal perforation, dizziness,
headache, edema, rash, heartburn, tinnitus,
and pruritus
COX-2–selective NSAIDs
Versus nonselective NSAIDs: COX-2–selective NSAIDs
associated with lower risk for adverse effects; RR,
0.83 (CI, 0.70–0.99) (moderate quality; 4 RCTs)
Abdominal pain, diarrhea, dizziness, dyspepsia,
edema, flatulence, headache, nausea, rash,
upper respiratory tract infection,
influenza-like illness, and musculoskeletal
and connective tissue signs and symptoms
(back pain, muscle spasms, and
musculoskeletal pain)
Opioids
Versus placebo: Short-term use associated with higher
risk; risks higher in trials that did not use an enriched
enrollment and withdrawal design; trials were not
designed to assess risks for overdose, abuse, and
addiction or long-term harms (moderate quality; 16
studies)
Short-term use: Nausea, dizziness, constipation,
vomiting, somnolence, and dry mouth
Long-term use: Addiction, abuse, overdose,
fractures, cardiovascular events, sexual
dysfunction, and motor vehicle accidents
SMRs
Versus placebo (any adverse event): SMRs associated
with increased risk; RR, 1.50 (CI, 1.14–1.98)
(moderate quality; 8 RCTs)
Sedation, drowsiness, and dizziness
Versus placebo (central nervous system events): SMRs
associated with increased risk (primarily sedation);
RR, 2.04 (CI, 1.23–3.37) (moderate quality; 8 RCTs)
Benzodiazepines
Versus placebo: Central nervous system adverse
events reported more frequently with
benzodiazepines, although harms were not
reported well; no trial was designed to evaluate
risks with long-term use (low quality; 9 RCTs)
Somnolence, fatigue, lightheadedness,
addiction, abuse, overdose, and fractures
Antidepressants
Versus placebo: Antidepressants associated with
higher risk for any adverse events but no differences
in rates of specific adverse events or serious adverse
events (moderate quality; 12 RCTs)
Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation,
sexual dysfunction, and nausea
Duloxetine associated with nausea and increased risk
for withdrawal due to adverse event
Systemic corticosteroids
Versus placebo: Trials did not report serious adverse
events, but adverse events were not reported well in
some trials (low quality; 12 RCTs)
Hyperglycemia requiring medical treatment,
facial flushing, infection, and gastrointestinal
bleeding
Adverse events reported for nonpharmacologic treatments*
Exercise, Tai chi, massage, and spinal manipulation: Harms typically related to muscle soreness and/or small increases in pain were reported.
Yoga: Reporting was suboptimal, but almost all adverse events were classified as mild to moderate.
TENS: Evidence was limited but suggests an increased risk for skin reactions without an increased risk for serious adverse events.
Heat: Heat was not associated with increased risk for skin flushing vs. no heat or placebo in 2 trials.
