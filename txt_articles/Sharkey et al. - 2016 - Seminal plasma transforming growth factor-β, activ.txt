STUDY QUESTION: Do seminal plasma transforming growth factor-β (TGFB) cytokines vary within individuals over time, and does this
relate to sperm parameters, age or prior abstinence?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Activin A and follistatin, and to a lesser extent TGFB1, TGFB2 and TGFB3, vary within individuals over time, in asso-
ciation with duration of abstinence.
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN: Seminal plasma TGFB cytokines can influence sperm function and reproductive success through interac-
tions with the female reproductive tract after coitus. Over time, individual sperm parameters fluctuate considerably. Whether seminal fluid
TGFB cytokines vary similarly, and the determinants of any variance, is unknown.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Between two and seven semen samples were collected from each of 14 fertile donors at 6–10
week intervals over the course of 12 months, then seminal plasma cytokines and sperm parameters were measured.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING AND METHOD: The concentrations and total amounts per ejaculate of TGFB1, TGFB2,
TGFB3, activin A and follistatin were determined using commercial assays. Sperm parameters were assessed according to WHO IV standards.
Mixed model analysis was utilised to determine the relative contribution of between- and within-individual factors to the variance.
Relationships between cytokines and sperm parameters, as well as effect of age and duration of abstinence, were investigated by correlation
analysis.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Within-individual variability contributed to the total variance for all cytokines and
sperm parameters, and was a stronger determinant than between-individual variability for activin A and follistatin as well as for total sperm
concentration and sperm motility. Positive correlations between each of the three TGFB isoforms, and activin and follistatin, suggest co-
regulation of synthesis. Duration of abstinence influenced total content of TGFB1, TGFB2, activin A and follistatin. TGFB1 correlated inversely
with age.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: A limited number of donors from a single clinic were investigated. Clinical information on
BMI, nutrition, smoking and other lifestyle factors was unavailable. Further studies are required to determine whether the findings can be gen-
eralised to larger populations and different ethnicities.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These data reveal substantial variation over time in seminal fluid cytokines and indicate
that repeated analyses are required to gain precise representative data on an individual’s status. Within-individual variation in seminal fluid
components should be taken into account when investigating seminal fluid cytokines.
STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: This study was supported by grants from the National Health and Medical Research
Council of Australia, ID453556 and APP1041332. The authors have no competing interests to disclose.

 Introduction
Semen analysis for investigation of fertility reveals inherent variability in
semen parameters within individual men, as well as at a population
level (Schwartz et al., 1979; Pacey, 2012). Sperm number, structure
and function are influenced by age (Johnson et al., 2015) and period of
abstinence (Heuchel et al., 1981), as well as by lifestyle, nutritional fac-
tors, occupation, environmental exposures and infection, and addition-
ally by genetics (Skakkebaek et al., 2016). Best clinical practice
therefore requires analysis of semen samples recovered at least 3
months apart for definitive diagnosis (Keel, 2006).
Sperm parameters alone are insufficient to predict male fertility and
fecundity, as normal sperm do not guarantee fertility. There is now
keen interest in identifying additional biomarkers of male fertility
(Sakkas et al., 2015). Seminal plasma is a complex fluid, with a rich
array of cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins and growth factors
(Maegawa et al., 2002; Politch et al., 2007; von Wolff et al., 2007;
Fraczek and Kurpisz, 2015). Within the testis, leukocytes as well as
Sertoli and Leydig cells secrete cytokines to support spermatogenesis
and steroidogenesis, and to regulate immune tolerance to germ cells
(Hedger and Meinhardt, 2003; Bornstein et al., 2004; Fraczek and
Kurpisz, 2015). The secondary male accessory sex glands, comprising
the epididymis, prostate and seminal vesicles, also produce cytokines
(Seshadri et al., 2009; Fraczek and Kurpisz, 2015).
An additional role for seminal fluid cytokines is to influence the
female reproductive tract to promote reproductive success (Robertson,
2005; Robertson and Sharkey, 2016). Animal studies show that seminal
fluid regulates female tract secretion of cytokines and growth factors to
support development of the pre-implantation embryo (Bromfield et al.,
2014) and to activate an immune response that promotes maternal
immune tolerance of embryo implantation (Robertson et al., 2009,
2013). In women, seminal fluid acts on the cervix to recruit neutrophils
(Pandya and Cohen, 1985; Thompson et al., 1992) and induce synthesis
of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which in turn attract
macrophages, dendritic cells and lymphocytes into the superficial epi-
thelium as well as the deeper stromal compartment (Sharkey et al.,
2012b). Seminal fluid influence on the female immune response may
explain how coitus around the time of embryo transfer promotes the
IVF embryo implantation rate (Tremellen et al., 2000; Crawford et al.,
2015), and why longer duration of sexual cohabitation protects women
from obstetric disorders (Kho et al., 2009).
The post-coital inflammatory response in women is mediated by the
transforming growth factor-β (TGFB) cytokines (Tremellen et al.,
1998; Sharkey et al., 2012a), comprising three isoforms TGFB1, TGFB2
and TGFB3, present in high concentrations in seminal fluid (Nocera
and Chu, 1993; Loras et al., 1999). Seminal fluid TGFB acts to induce
female tract expression of colony-stimulating factor 2 (CSF2) and
interleukin-6
(IL6),
which
promote
receptivity
for
pregnancy
(Robertson, 2007; Prins et al., 2012). TGFB exhibits immune-deviating
properties and induces female immune tolerance through generation
of regulatory T cells (Robertson et al., 2002).
The ready detection of cytokines and chemokines in human seminal
fluid and their recognised influence on sperm function and female
reproductive physiology makes them attractive as potential biomar-
kers of fertility. Several studies have sought to quantify seminal fluid
cytokines in fertile and infertile men with the aim of defining diagnostic
cytokine profiles, or of identifying relationships with sperm parameters
(Srivastava et al., 1996; Loras et al., 1999; Maegawa et al., 2002; von
Wolff et al., 2007). No difference in TGFB content has been found for
infertile men to date; however, previous studies have examined only a
single ejaculate from each participant (Loras et al., 1999; von Wolff
et al., 2007). Whether seminal fluid cytokine concentrations display
natural variation similar to sperm parameters is unknown.
Therefore, we aimed to evaluate within-individual variance in sem-
inal fluid cytokines, in order to determine the utility of cytokine analysis
in a single ejaculate. Our data indicate that indeed cytokine content
does fluctuate substantially over time, to an extent that varies depend-
ing on the cytokine, potentially impacting sperm parameters and
female partner reproductive function.
Materials and Methods
Ethics approval and study participants
Approval was obtained from the ethics committees of the University of
Adelaide and North Western Allied Health Service, application 7/1999.
Seminal plasma samples were collected from fertile semen donors at
Repromed (Adelaide) following informed written consent. Donors met
inclusion criteria including good health, age of 18–50 years and normo-
zoospermic by WHO IV guidelines (World Health Organization, 1999).
Fertility was defined as natural conception or conception via Repromed’s
semen donor program with a live birth. Exclusion criteria included screen-
ing positive for chlamydia, gonorrohoea or HSV, symptoms of urinary or
genital tract infection, or use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, antibio-
tics or other immune-modifying medications.
Seminal plasma collection
Semen samples were produced on-site at Repromed by masturbation,
using strict protocols for hygiene, no use of lubricants or condoms, and fol-
lowing abstinence for 48–120 h. Complete ejaculates were collected into
sterile containers and processed within 30 min of collection. All partici-
pants produced three to six samples, at 6–8 week intervals, over a
12-month period. All samples were analysed by the same experienced
andrologist to determine semen volume, sperm concentration and morph-
ology and % progressive motile sperm according to WHO IV guidelines
(World Health Organization, 1999). Semen volume was measured using a
graduated serological pipette. After centrifugation for 15 min at 13 000g,
the supernatant (seminal plasma) was aliquoted into 100 μl volumes, fro-
zen and stored at −80°C until cytokine analysis.
Seminal plasma cytokine ELISAs
All cytokines were measured by commercial ELISAs from R&D Systems
(Minneapolis, MN, USA) (activin A, follistatin, TGFB3) or Promega
(Madison, WI, USA) (TGFB1 and TGFB2) according to the manufacturers’
instructions.
To measure total TGFB1, TGFB2 and TGFB3, seminal plasma was transi-
ently acidified to release biologically active protein from the latent precur-
sor form (Nocera and Chu, 1995). For each ELISA, 100 μl of seminal
plasma was combined with 300 μl of Dulbecco’s PBS and 50 μl of 1 M HCl
to achieve a pH of 3.0. Following incubation for 20 min at room tempera-
ture, samples were neutralised with 50 μl of 1 M NaOH.
The TGFB1 ELISA was confirmed to have <2.0% cross-reactivity with
TGFB2 and TGFB3 isoforms and a minimum detection limit of 32 pg/ml,
with intra-assay and inter-assay precision of 3.7 and 6.5%. The TGFB2
ELISA had <0.7% cross-reactivity with other TGFB isoforms and a detec-
tion limit of 32 pg/ml, with intra-assay and inter-assay precision of 4.3 and

 7.2%. The TGFB3 ELISA had no cross-reactivity with other TGFB isoforms
and a detection limit of 15.6 pg/ml, with intra-assay and inter-assay preci-
sion of 3.4 and 6.1%. The minimum detection limit, and intra- and inter-
assay precisions were 4 pg/ml, 4.3 and 5.2% for activin A, and 83 pg/ml,
3.6 and 7.2% for follistatin.
Data analysis and statistics
Cytokines were analysed as both concentration and absolute amount per
ejaculate (concentration × volume of ejaculate), as recommended by
WHO V guidelines (World Health Organization, 2010). Analysis was per-
formed by using SAS Software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC,
USA). The approach was to estimate a mixed model with a random effect
for individual. The mean square error in the random effects model attribut-
able to between-individual variability (BIV) and within-individual variability
(WIV) and the ratio between the two (variability ratio, VR = BIV/WIV)
were then calculated. A VR value of <1.0 indicates a greater contribution
of WIV than BIV to overall variance. With the exception of sperm concen-
tration, motility and normal morphology, all models were run on data
transformed by natural logarithm, as most data were positively skewed.
Coefficients of variation (CV) were generated with variance estimated as
the residual variance after accounting for the random effect of individual in
the random effect model. Pearson’s correlation analysis using SPSS version
22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, USA) was used to explore correlations between
sperm and cytokine parameters. Correction for multiple comparisons was
performed using the step-down Bonferroni procedure described by Holm
(1979), with adjusted P-values reported. Statistical significance was inferred
when P < 0.05.
Results
Within- and between-individual variation in
semen parameters
The semen characteristics for all samples were within WHO IV normal
reference ranges for sperm concentration (Fig. 1A and E), progressive
motility (Fig. 1B and F), normal morphology (Fig. 1C and G) and vol-
ume of ejaculate (Fig. 1D and H). Age and duration of abstinence
(mean ± SD) in men were 40.8 ± 6.3 years and 4.0 ± 1.6 days,
respectively. Random effects modelling indicated that WIV contribu-
ted more than BIV to sample distribution for sperm concentration
(CV = 0.32, VR = 0.64) (Fig. 1E). Variability in sperm motility was also
principally due to within-individual variation (CV = 0.07, VR = 0.59)
(Fig. 1F). Between-individual differences accounted mainly for the vari-
ation in both normal sperm morphology (CV = 0.19, VR = 2.67)
(Fig. 1G) and volume (CV = 0.23, VR = 3.23) (Fig. 1H).
Within- and between-individual variation in
TGFB1, TGFB2 and TGFB3
TGFB1 was the most prevalent TGFB isoform in seminal plasma at a
median (range) content of 658 (154–2051) ng/ejaculate (Fig. 2A).
Modelling showed a greater degree of between-individual than within-
individual difference (CV = 0.35, VR = 2.89) (Fig. 2E). In contrast, sub-
stantial within-individual fluctuation was evident in endogenous active
TGFB1 (CV = 1.56, VR = 0.31) (Supp. Fig. 1), which comprised 0.5%
(0.04–2.4%) of total TGFB1 (Supp. Fig. 2).
TGFB2 in seminal plasma was considerably less abundant than
TGFB1 at 12.2 (1.9–58.0) ng/ejaculate (Fig. 2B), with variation due
principally to between-individual difference (CV = 0.44, VR = 1.80)
(Fig. 2F). Within-individual fluctuation was the dominant contributor
to variance in active TGFB2 (CV = 0.84, VR = 0.64) (Supp. Fig. 1),
which comprised 4.4% (0.2–18.8%) of total TGFB2 (Supp. Fig. 2).
TGFB3 was approximately half as abundant as TGFB1 and substan-
tially more adudant than TGFB2 at 262 (4.4–1459) ng/ejaculate
(Fig. 2C). TGFB3 was more variable than both TGFB1 and TGFB2, but
again between-individual difference accounted for most of the vari-
ation (CV = 0.72, VR = 2.58) (Fig. 2G). Unlike the other isoforms,
variance in active TGFB3 was mainly accounted for by between-
individual difference (CV = 0.43, VR = 3.85) (Supp. Fig. 1).
Endogenous active TGFB3 comprised 1.7% (0.7–5.1%) of total TGFB3
(Supp. Fig. 2).
Combined TGFB (the sum of TGFB1, TGFB2 and TGFB3) was 978
(104–2644) ng/ejaculate (Fig. 2D). Variation was less than for individ-
ual isoforms and was mainly due to between-individual variation
(CV = 0.29, VR = 2.01) (Fig. 2H). Between-individual differences
accounted for the majority of variance in combined active TGFB
(CV = 0.42, VR = 1.73) (Supp. Fig. 1).
Variance in TGFB concentration was comparable to TGFB content,
and was principally accounted for by between-individual variation. For
the concentration of all three TGFB isoforms combined, variance was
high
and
substantial
within-individual
fluctuation
was
evident
(CV = 0.46, VR = 0.62) (Supp. Fig. 3).
Within- and between-individual variation in
activin A and follistatin
Activin A was detectable in all seminal fluid samples at median (range)
of 1.3 (0.16–9.6) ng/ejaculate (Fig. 3A). Mixed model analysis showed
the substantial variability in activin A content was attributable to
within-individual fluctuation and, to a lesser extent, between-individual
differences (CV = 0.72, VR = 0.73). Similar variance, attributable pre-
dominantly to within-individual fluctuations, was seen when activin A
concentration was assessed (CV = 0.590, VR = 0.20) (Supp. Fig. 4).
Follistatin content was higher and more variable at 131 (1.2–1268)
ng/ejaculate (Fig. 3B). Within-individual fluctuation and, to a lesser
extent, between-individual differences contributed to the variation
(CV = 1.50, VR = 0.74). High variance was also seen in follistatin con-
centration,
attributable
mainly
to
within-individual
fluctuations
(CV = 1.35, VR = 0.61) (Supp. Fig. 4).
Impact of duration of abstinence and age on
semen parameters and cytokines
Correlation analysis was performed to investigate the impact of dur-
ation of abstinence and age on semen parameters and cytokines. The
number of days of prior abstinence positively correlated with sperm
concentration (R = 0.310, P = 0.021) and semen volume (R = 0.458,
P < 0.001), but negatively correlated with sperm motility (R = −0.329,
P = 0.014). Sperm concentration correlated positively with normal
sperm morphology (R = 0.428, P = 0.004). No correlation was
observed between semen parameters and donor age.
Duration of abstinence correlated with the content of TGFB1,
TGFB2, activin A and follistatin (all P < 0.05), but not of TGFB3
(Table I). No association with abstinence was seen when cytokine con-
centrations were evaluated (Supp. Table I). The only significant associ-
ation between age and absolute cytokine content was for TGFB1 total
content (P = 0.013) (Table I) and concentration (Supp. Table I).

 There were high correlations between absolute amounts of each of
the TGFB isoforms (all P < 0.01) (Table II), which were also evident
when TGFB2 and TGFB3 concentrations were considered (P = 0.003)
(Supp. Table II). Activin A and follistatin correlated with one another
(P = 0.001) and also with TGFB1 (P < 0.01) (Table I), although these
relationships did not hold up when concentrations were considered
(Supp. Table II).
Discussion
This analysis demonstrated substantial within-individual variation over
time in seminal plasma TGFB cytokines, regardless of whether abso-
lute content per ejaculate, or cytokine concentration in seminal
plasma, was considered. On the basis of CV score and the ratio of
within- to between-individual variation, activin A and follistatin were
identified as exhibiting the greatest variability over time, while the
three TGFB isoforms fluctuated to a lesser extent.
Not unexpectedly, an important determinant of absolute cytokine
content was duration of abstinence prior to sample provision.
Abstinence did not affect cytokine concentration, indicating a domin-
ant effect due to volume of ejaculate as opposed to regulation of cyto-
kine production. TGFB1, TGFB2, activin A and follistatin were all
elevated with increasing abstinence, in each case attributable to a par-
allel increase in ejaculate volume.
As expected, sperm parameters also varied within individuals, par-
ticularly sperm count and sperm motility. None of the evaluated cyto-
kines correlated positively to sperm parameters, other than TGFB1
and sperm morphology. TGFB1 and activin A were also linked with
poorer sperm motility, but a causal relationship is unlikely because
longer periods of abstinence are independently linked with reduced
sperm motility. The lack of correlation between seminal plasma TGFB
and sperm parameters is consistent with two previous studies
(Srivastava et al., 1996; Loras et al., 1999).
The levels of total TGFB1 and TGFB2 reported herein are comparable
to those observed by Nocera and Chu (1995), but considerably higher
than those in some other reports (Srivastava et al., 1996; Loras et al.,
1999). This may reflect differences in the assays utilised, with early mea-
surements made in bioassays employing CCL64 mink lung cells
(Lokeshwar and Block, 1992; Nocera and Chu, 1993). Underestimation
of TGFB in seminal plasma can occur when samples are inadequately
activated, which requires acidification to a sufficiently low pH of 3.0–4.0
(Nocera and Chu, 1995).
The current study is the first to quantify the TGFB3 isoform in a sub-
stantial biobank of seminal plasma samples. TGFB3 is synthesised by
Leydig cells of human testes where it may regulate spermatogenesis
(Zhang et al., 2004). Synthesis may also occur in the prostate where
TGFB1 and TGFB2 originate (Lee et al., 1999). We found that TGFB3
was approximately half as abundant as TGFB1 and over 20 times more
abundant than TGFB2.
As in previous studies, the vast majority of seminal plasma TGFB for
all three isoforms was comprised latent TGFB, which must be cleaved
to the active form to achieve biological activity, presumably to prevent
biological effects at the site of production. Endogenously active TGFB1
and TGFB2 fluctuate more extensively within individuals than total
TGFB1 and TGFB2, but the significance of this is unknown. While there
might be implications for the male reproductive tissues where TGFB
originates, an impact on female fertility seems unlikely given that TGFB
becomes further activated after intromission.
Activin A and follistatin were present in seminal plasma at levels com-
parable to previous reports (Anderson et al., 1998; Ochsenkuhn et al.,
2006). Like other TGFB family members, these appear to attenuate the
female reproductive tract response to semen at coitus (Sharkey et al.,
2015; Robertson and Sharkey, 2016). There are interactions between
these factors including potential cross-regulation of synthesis (Hedger
et al., 2011), consistent with our observation of a correlation between
their absolute abundance. Control of activin A and follistatin synthesis in
the male reproductive tract is not well understood, although the action
of these factors in controlling inflammation and immunity implies poten-
tial regulation by pro-inflammatory stimuli (Hedger et al., 2011).
As well as total content, concentrations of cytokines also varied sub-
stantially within individuals. This was independent of abstinence dur-
ation, implying that additional regulatory factors contribute to cytokine
control. Although testosterone is identified as a principle regulator of
seminal fluid factors that interacts with female tissues in mice
(Robertson et al., 1996), there is no data on the extent to which tes-

Variation in human seminal plasma cytokines

 speculate that smoking, nutrition, occupation and environmental expo-
sures, previously identified as impacting sperm parameters, also
influence seminal fluid cytokine composition, but this remains to be
formally examined. The current data do not identify a relationship with
age for any cytokine other than TGFB1, but the study was not suffi-
ciently powered to draw a firm conclusion on this. Clinical records to
evaluate the impact of lifestyle factors on cytokine parameters were
unavailable for the current study.
In summary, this study demonstrates variation over time in seminal
fluid cytokine content in response to duration of abstinence as well as
other unidentified determinants. Our data indicate that measuring
cytokines in a single seminal fluid sample is unlikely to be representa-
tive of the average abundance over time, particularly for the highly fluc-
tuating cytokines, follistatin and activin A. It is well accepted that to
gain an accurate diagnosis of fertility status, multiple semen samples
must be assessed to accommodate the variation over time in sperm
parameters (Schwartz et al., 1979; Pacey, 2012). The finding that cyto-
kines vary substantially within men over time implies that repeated
analyses are also necessary to gain accurate information on cytokine
status, and where possible, duration of abstinence should be con-
trolled. Additional studies are required to further investigate the
underlying causes of this fluctuation and its significance for the repro-
ductive health of men and their partners.
