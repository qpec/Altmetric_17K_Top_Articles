Background: Cannabis is available from medical dispensaries
for treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in many states
of the union, yet its efficacy in treating PTSD symptoms remains
uncertain.
Purpose: To identify ongoing studies and review existing evi-
dence regarding the benefits and harms of plant-based canna-
bis preparations in treating PTSD in adults.
Data Sources: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and other
sources from database inception to March 2017.
Study Selection: English-language systematic reviews, trials,
and observational studies with a control group that reported
PTSD symptoms and adverse effects of plant-based cannabis
use in adults with PTSD.
Data Extraction: Study data extracted by 1 investigator was
checked by a second reviewer; 2 reviewers independently as-
sessed study quality, and the investigator group graded the
overall strength of evidence by using standard criteria.
Data Synthesis: Two systematic reviews, 3 observational stud-
ies, and no randomized trials were found. The systematic reviews
reported insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about bene-
fits and harms. The observational studies found that compared
with nonuse, cannabis did not reduce PTSD symptoms. Studies
had medium and high risk of bias, and overall evidence was
judged insufficient. Two randomized trials and 6 other studies
examining outcomes of cannabis use in patients with PTSD are
ongoing and are expected to be completed within 3 years.
Limitation: Very scant evidence with medium to high risk of
bias.
Conclusion: Evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions about
the benefits and harms of plant-based cannabis preparations in
patients with PTSD, but several ongoing studies may soon pro-
vide important results.

C
annabis use has become more common in the
United States—the number of persons reporting
past-year cannabis use nearly doubled between 2001
and 2013 to 1 in 10 adults (1). Cannabis has been le-
galized for recreational purposes in 8 states of the
union and the District of Columbia and for medical use
in 28 states and the District of Columbia (2–4). Many
states list posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as an in-
dication for cannabis use (5). More than one third of
patients seeking cannabis for medical purposes in
states where it is legal list PTSD as the primary reason
for their request (6–8). However, little comprehensive
and critically appraised information is available about
the benefits and harms of cannabis use for treating
PTSD. The objectives of this systematic review were to
assess the benefits and harms of plant-based cannabis
use in patients with PTSD and to identify ongoing stud-
ies in this area.
METHODS
This article is part of a larger report commissioned
by the Veterans Health Administration (8). The review
plan was posted to a publicly accessible Web site be-
fore the study was initiated (9).
Data Sources and Searches
We searched Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed,
PsycINFO, the Published International Literature on
Traumatic Stress database, Evidence-Based Medicine
Reviews (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,
Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness,
Health Technology Assessment Database, and Co-
chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), and gray
literature sources from database inception through
March 2017. We obtained additional articles from sys-
tematic reviews, reference lists, and experts and also
searched for ongoing, unpublished, or recently com-
pleted studies at ClinicalTrials.gov, the International
Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the International Stan-
dard Randomised Controlled Trials Number registry,
the National Institutes of Health Reporter, and the
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Grants
On-Line Database. The searches, developed in consul-
tation with a research librarian, were limited to English-
language literature (Appendix A of the Supplement,

 Study Selection
We included studies (systematic reviews, con-
trolled clinical trials, and observational studies using
control groups) of nonpregnant adults with PTSD that
assessed the effects of plant-based cannabis prepara-
tions or whole-plant extracts, such as nabiximols, a non-
synthetic pharmaceutical product with a standard com-
position
and
dosage.
(For
selection
criteria,
see
Appendix B of the Supplement, available at Annals
.org). We did not include synthesized, pharmaceutically
prepared
cannabinoids,
such
as
dronabinol
and
nabilone, because they are not available in dispensa-
ries, and the efficacy of synthetic cannabinoid prepara-
tions was examined in a recent review (10, 11). We
broadly defined plant-based cannabis preparations to
include any preparation of the plant or its extracts to
capture the wide variety of products available in U.S.
dispensaries (12).
We dual-screened 5% of identified abstracts and all
full-text articles; disagreements were resolved by a
third reviewer. We included only systematic reviews
that reported their search strategy, inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria, and risk-of-bias assessment of included
studies (13). We included all individual studies meeting
inclusion criteria that either were published after the
end search date of a selected review or had not been
included in a previous systematic review. We also iden-
tified all ongoing studies (trials and observational and

 mixed-methods studies) examining the benefits or
harms of cannabis use in patients with PTSD.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
One investigator extracted study details (such as
design, setting, patient population, intervention, follow-
up, co-interventions, health outcomes, health care use,
and harms), whereas a second investigator reviewed
the accuracy of the data extracted. Two reviewers inde-
pendently assessed study quality as low, medium, or
high risk of bias, considering the potential sources of
bias most relevant to this evidence base by adapting an
existing assessment tool (14, 15) (Appendix C of the
Supplement, available at Annals.org). Disagreements
were resolved by consensus.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
We qualitatively synthesized the evidence and did
not conduct a meta-analysis because of the small num-
ber of studies and their marked clinical heterogeneity.
Our main outcome of interest was effects on PTSD
symptoms and severity. Secondary outcomes of inter-
est included quality of life, mental health, and health
care use. After group discussion, we classified the over-
all strength of evidence for each outcome as high,
moderate, low, or insufficient on the basis of the con-
sistency, coherence, and applicability of the body of
evidence as well as the internal validity of individual
studies (16, 17).
Role of the Funding Source
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Qual-
ity Enhancement Research Initiative supported the re-
view but had no role in the design and conduct of the
study; collection, management, analysis, and interpre-
tation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of
the manuscript; or the decision to submit the manu-
script for publication.
RESULTS
Of 13 764 screened titles and abstracts, 2 system-
atic reviews (18, 19) and 3 primary studies (20–22) were
selected (Figure). Most individual studies of cannabis
use in patients with PTSD that were excluded were
cross-sectional or did not include a comparison group.
Benefits and Harms of Cannabis for Treating
PTSD
Systematic Reviews
The authors of the 2 selected systematic reviews
searched the literature to March 2015 and September
2015, respectively (18, 19). In the first review, Wilkinson
and colleagues (18) looked at 3 studies of nabilone (a
synthetic cannabis) (23–25) and 3 studies of plant-
based cannabis that reported on PTSD symptoms; of
the latter group, 2 studies were prospective, open-label
trials without a control group (26, 27) and 1 was a case
series ([28], as cited in [18]). The authors considered
the evidence insufficient to determine whether canna-
bis (in either plant-based or synthetic form) is effective
in treating PTSD. In the second review, Walsh and col-
leagues (19) evaluated 4 observational studies of syn-
thetic and nonsynthetic cannabis preparations that re-
ported on PTSD symptoms (20, 24, 27, 29). Although

 cannabis was associated with less severe PTSD symp-
toms in 3 cross-sectional studies (24, 27, 29), 1 retro-
spective cohort study (described in detail later) found
that cannabis was associated with worsening PTSD
symptoms (20). This review (19) also included 3 pro-
spective studies of potential harms associated with can-
nabis use in patients with PTSD (7, 30, 31) and noted
that cannabis use disorder in these patients was asso-
ciated with negative treatment and cessation out-
comes. Of note, none of those 3 studies met our selec-
tion criteria for individual study review, and strength of
evidence was not formally rated in the second review.
Individual Studies
Table 1 provides a summary of the 3 individual
studies that met our inclusion criteria. One was a retro-
spective cohort study (20) that was included in 1 of the
systematic reviews (19). This large observational study
examined data from 47 000 veterans in VA intensive
PTSD programs from 1992 to 2011. Veterans who re-
ported consuming more than 2 alcoholic drinks on 1
occasion or using any other drug 30 days before ad-
mission or who were referred from a drug or alcohol
treatment program were excluded from the study. The
remaining participants were grouped into “never-
users”; “stoppers,” who used cannabis before but not
after admission; “continuing users”; and “starters,” who
did not use cannabis before admission but started af-
terward. After balancing sample sizes across groups
and adjusting for sociodemographic features and base-
line clinical, community adjustment, and program
participation variables, the investigators compared
4-month outcomes for 2276 veterans. Adjusted analy-
ses found that continuing users and starters had worse
PTSD symptoms than never-users and stoppers at 4
months of follow-up, although the absolute differences
were small (mean score on the short form of the Missis-
sippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD was 36.64 for
stoppers and 39.67 for starters; P < 0.01 [20]). Continu-
ing users and starters also had a higher level of drug
abuse (mean Addiction Severity Index [ASI] score,
0.128 and 0.130, respectively) than never-users (mean
ASI score, 0.037) and stoppers (mean ASI score, 0.034;
P < 0.01 for paired comparisons). Starters had a higher
level of alcohol abuse (mean ASI score, 0.229) than the
other groups (mean ASI score: 0.129 for continuers,
0.079 for stoppers, and 0.096 for never-users; P <
0.01), and continuing users had a higher level of alco-
hol abuse than stoppers (P < 0.01). Starters had a
higher level of violent behavior at follow-up than the
other groups; mean score based on a 4-item question-
naire from the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment
Study ([32], as cited in reference 20) was 1.25 among
starters, 0.93 among continuing users, 0.76 among
stoppers, and 0.87 among never-users (P < 0.01). No
differences were found in employment status.
Two studies (21, 22) not included in either of the
systematic reviews met our inclusion criteria. One study
of age- and sex-matched patients entering a VA-based
primary care and mental health integration program
(21) included 350 patients with PTSD who used canna-
bis and 350 who did not. Compared with cannabis us-
ers, nonusers were more likely to be married, white,
employed, and financially stable. After these and other
potential confounding variables, such as alcohol use,
depression symptom severity, and suicidal ideation,
were controlled for, no association was found between
frequency of cannabis use and PTSD symptom severity

Purpose of Study
Participants and Intervention/Comparator
Primary Outcome and Timing
To examine the role of a behavioral
intervention for sleep on cannabis use
frequency and insomnia symptoms
among veterans with CUD and
insomnia.
200 veterans with CUD and insomnia randomly
assigned to 1 of the following conditions:
CBT for insomnia
CBT for insomnia + CBT-I Coach (mobile application)
Placebo control (quasi-desensitization)
Change in cannabis use frequency, point-
prevalence abstinence, and change in sleep
quality at multiple time points up to 6 mo after
treatment
To examine the effects of cannabis use on
extinction learning by using both a
standard discriminative conditioning
and extinction task at pretreatment and
response to an exposure treatment
protocol. Also to examine the ability of a
brief protocol to decrease PTSD in and
retain in treatment patients with and
without cannabis use.
72 men and women aged 18–65 y with chronic PTSD
(≥3 mo), 50% of whom are heavy cannabis smokers
(≥5 d/wk) and 50% of whom are cannabis nonusers
(no use in the past 3 mo).
Brief imaginal exposure protocol (6 daily sessions) for
PTSD is provided to all participants.
PTSD severity (PSS-I severity) at posttreatment
and 12-wk follow-up; treatment dropout
(completion of <5 imaginal exposure sessions).
Other outcomes: Depression symptoms (QIDS)
and cannabis use and problems (MPS and
Marijuana Frequency and Quantity Scale)
assessed at posttreatment and 12-wk follow-up
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of
smoked cannabis of 4 different
concentrations among participants
with chronic, treatment-resistant,
combat-related PTSD.
76 veterans with service-related PTSD (≥6 mo duration
and moderate severity at baseline) who smoke
≥1.8 g of cannabis per day in the following
concentrations for 3 wk:
High THC (more THC than CBD)
High CBD (more CBD than THC)
High THC/high CBD (equal amounts)
Placebo cannabis (low levels of THC/CBD)
Participants receive 2 of the 4 types of cannabis
during 2 stages, each lasting 3 wk (2-wk washout).
Change in CAPS Global Severity Score at 3 wk
and 8 wk after randomization.
Other outcomes: Depression and anxiety
symptoms, general and psychosocial
functioning, sleep quality, suicidal ideation,
responses to cannabis, withdrawal, and results
of blood and urine tests
To fill a large gap in the literature by
providing an a priori test of the effect of
cannabis, including variations in
cannabinoids, on individual sleep,
PTSD, and psychosocial functioning.
150 veterans currently using cannabis who are
members of the Santa Cruz Veterans Alliance.
Data are collected through repeated survey
assessments every other week. All products
provided to veterans by the Santa Cruz Veterans
Alliance are tested for cannabinoid content by an
independent laboratory.
The association between cannabinoid
concentration and symptoms of PTSD, sleep,
and psychosocial functioning over time among
cannabis-using veterans.
To determine whether, among a sample of
Colorado residents (veterans and
nonveterans), persons with PTSD who
obtain and use cannabis from a medical
or recreational dispensary compared
with a matched sample of persons with
PTSD who report no current cannabis
use at study baseline (control) will
exhibit lower PTSD symptom severity.
150 adult Colorado residents with PTSD, 50% of whom
use cannabis from a medical or recreational
dispensary in Colorado and 50% of whom report
no recent (within the past 6 mo) cannabis use.
Assessment at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 mo after
baseline. Measures include interview (MINI,
CAPS-5, and TLFB), self-report, computerized
neuropsychological assessments, and results of
actigraphy for 1 wk after each assessment point
and urine tests for objective verification of use
status. Furthermore, those using cannabis report
on the cannabis used and the dispensary from
which it is obtained, and a sample is procured and
tested for cannabinoid and terpene content.
PTSD symptom severity, as indexed by self-
reported overall symptom severity at each time
point as assessed by the CAPS-5, self-reported
and objective sleep quality at each time point
as assessed by the PSQI and actigraphy, and
interview-based diagnosis at 12-mo follow-up
as assessed by the CAPS-5.
Secondary outcomes (assessed at each time
point): Self-reported and objective
psychosocial functioning, suicidal ideation, and
engagement in medical and psychological
services
To build understanding of cannabis use in
veterans with PTSD by characterizing
cannabis use patterns and motives in
veterans with PTSD symptoms,
conducting a prospective examination
of the day-to-day relations between
PTSD symptoms and cannabis use, and
conducting the first effort to
qualitatively describe the perspective of
veterans with PTSD who use cannabis.
Veterans diagnosed with PTSD who report at least
weekly cannabis use are invited to participate in an
anonymous online survey (n = 200), daily symptom
and use monitoring (i.e., IVR; n = 48), in-depth
qualitative interviews (n = 30), and blood draws for
cannabis biomarkers (n = 48).
Characterize cannabis use patterns and replicate
previous findings related to PTSD symptoms,
cannabis use, motives for use, and craving
through use of an online survey.
Examine (via IVR) day-to-day relations between
cannabis use and PTSD symptoms along with a
1-time assessment of cannabis use motives.
Characterize veterans' beliefs about the relations
between cannabis use and mental health
symptoms and treatment, including the role of
cannabis in PTSD symptom management,
treatment for cannabis use, and PTSD
treatment through key informant interviews.
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of
vaporized cannabis of 3 different
concentrations among participants with
chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD.
42 adults with PTSD (≥6 mo duration and a PCL-5 score
≥40 at baseline). Approximately 50% police/
military veterans, 33%–50% female, and 8%–12%
Aboriginal (First Nations, Metis, and Inuit).
≥2 g of cannabis per day administered via vaporization
in the following concentrations:
High THC/low CBD
High THC/high CBD
Low THC/low CBD
Change in CAPS Global Severity Score at 3 wk
and 8 wk after randomization.
Other outcomes: Anxiety and depression
symptoms, psychosocial functioning,
preference, sleep quality, problems associated
with cannabis use, and suicidal thoughts or
behaviors
To examine how cannabinoids are related
to the processing of fear signals, the
experience of emotions and fear, and
the pattern of brain activity involved in
these processes and in the
development of PTSD.
78 adults with PTSD randomly assigned to a 1-time oral
dose of the following:
Dronabinol, 5.0 mg
Dronabinol, 10.0 mg
Placebo
Baseline, approximately 2 h after oral dose, and
≥1 wk after oral dose: Brain measures
(functional magnetic resonance imaging), skin
conductance response, and aversive cue
expectancy ratings
Other outcomes: Measures of distress, mood,
drug effects, anxiety, heart rate, and blood
pressure

 severity after cognitive behavioral treatment for comor-
bid PTSD and substance use (22). In this study, 32 of
136 participants reported cannabis use up to 1 week
before treatment. In analyses that adjusted for age, sex,
and baseline symptom severity, the authors found no
statistically significant association between baseline
cannabis use and PTSD symptom severity. More fre-
quent ongoing cannabis use was associated with more
severe PTSD symptoms earlier in treatment but with
less severe symptoms later in therapy (22). The associ-
ation between baseline cannabis use and days of
substance use during treatment was not statistically
significant.
Overall Strength of Evidence
Overall, we found insufficient evidence regarding
the benefits and harms of plant-based cannabis prepa-
rations for patients with PTSD. The body of literature
currently available is limited by small sample sizes, lack
of adjustment for important potential confounders,
cross-sectional study designs, and a paucity of studies
with non–cannabis-using control groups.
Ongoing Studies of Cannabis Use in Persons
with PTSD
Recently, 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
were initiated that were designed to evaluate the ben-
efits and harms of cannabis therapy for PTSD. The Col-
orado Department of Public Health and Environment
has funded a triple-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled
trial to determine the effects of smoking 4 different
types of cannabis with various tetrahydrocannabinol
and cannabidiol concentrations on PTSD symptoms in
veterans (M. Bonn-Miller, study director; ClinicalTrials
.gov: NCT02759185). The anticipated completion date
of the trial is April 2019. Eades and colleagues are con-
ducting a study sponsored by Tilray and the University
of British Columbia (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02517424).
This study is a crossover RCT of 42 adults with PTSD
who will be administered different amounts of tetrahy-
drocannabinol and cannabidiol (high–low, high–high,
and low–low) to compare PTSD, mental health, and
physical health outcomes. Other studies of cannabis
and PTSD are ongoing that are not RCTs or that are
investigating cannabis-related outcomes but are not
specifically testing the effectiveness of cannabis in re-
ducing PTSD symptoms. These studies are expected to
be completed within the next 3 years; their details are
presented in Table 2.
DISCUSSION
In this systematic review, we found insufficient evi-
dence to draw conclusions about potential benefits and
harms of cannabis use in patients with PTSD. Two re-
cent systematic reviews came to similar conclusions,
and these reviews, along with 3 additional observa-
tional studies, do not provide enough rigorous data to
comment on the potential benefits and harms of can-
nabis use in patients with PTSD. No trials have been
completed and few observational studies have been
done comparing outcomes between cannabis users
and nonusers.
Our findings are similar to those of other recently
published reviews identified in our literature searches
(18, 19, 33). The National Academy of Sciences (NAS)
examined the health effects of cannabis (33) and simi-
larly concluded that more rigorous study is necessary
to determine the effectiveness of cannabis in treating
PTSD. The NAS noted that results from a crossover clin-
ical trial of nabilone, a synthetic form of cannabis (25),
in 10 Canadian military personnel indicate that it may
have potential as an effective treatment for PTSD symp-
toms, such as nightmares, but that further study is nec-
essary. The report also described limited evidence
based on observational studies that plant-based cannabis
is associated with increased severity of PTSD symptoms.
Although we found insufficient evidence, cannabis
is commonly available. Despite the limited research on
benefits and harms, many states allow medicinal use of
cannabis for PTSD (5). The popular press has reported
many stories about individuals who had improvement
in their PTSD symptoms with cannabis use, and cross-
sectional studies have been done in which patients with
more severe PTSD reported cannabis use as a coping
strategy (34). However, it is impossible to determine
from these reports whether cannabis use is a marker for
more severe symptoms or is effective at reducing
symptoms, or whether the perceived beneficial effects
are the result of the cannabis, placebo effects, or the
natural course of symptoms.
Clinicians
will
need
to
engage
in
evidence-
informed discussions with patients who have PTSD and
choose to use or request cannabis. Potential mental
health–related harms may exist that are particularly rel-
evant for patients with PTSD. Our full evidence synthe-
sis report and another article describe in greater detail
the potential harms of cannabis use in general popula-
tions (8, 35). We found low- to moderate-strength evi-
dence that cannabis use is associated with an increased
risk for psychotic symptoms, psychosis, mania, and—in
active users—short-term cognitive dysfunction.
Patients with PTSD or those with serious mental ill-
ness, especially those who already have hypervigilance,
agitation, or anger management issues, might be at
greater risk for serious consequences if they have any
adverse effects. Although clinicians do not have ade-
quate data to quantify risks and benefits for patients
with PTSD, they might consider discussing potentially
serious adverse effects related to mental health, cogni-
tion,
and
cannabis
use
disorder
during
shared
decision-making conversations. Clinicians also should
discuss other evidence-based interventions recom-
mended by the 2010 VA and Department of Defense
Clinical Practice Guidelines for Management of Post-
traumatic Stress (36), the Institute of Medicine (37), or
the National Center for PTSD (38).
The primary limitation to this body of evidence is
the lack of efficacy trials. Additional methodological is-
sues of included studies are detailed in the quality as-
sessment tables (Appendix C of the Supplement). Our

 approach to evidence synthesis also has limitations. We
excluded studies of synthetic, prescription cannabi-
noids, because these agents were included in recent
reviews and are not available in dispensaries. Including
these studies would not have changed our overall find-
ings, because the studies were few and all were small
and methodologically limited. A systematic review in-
cluding studies of both synthetic and plant-based can-
nabis concluded that evidence from examining its ef-
fects in PTSD is insufficient (18).
Virtually no conclusive information exists regarding
the benefits of cannabis use in patients with PTSD and
information on harms is limited, so methodologically
strong research in almost any area likely would add to
the strength of evidence. Of particular importance are
studies with a longer follow-up and those including
cannabis-naive patients. Research is needed to com-
pare cannabis preparations to determine effects of po-
tency of cannabidiol versus tetrahydrocannabinol con-
tent. Comparative effectiveness research of cannabis
versus evidence-based pharmacologic and psychother-
apy interventions for treating PTSD symptoms is war-
ranted. Research is needed on the potential for mental
health and cognitive harms of cannabis use in popula-
tions with PTSD, because other mental health disorders
and impaired cognitive functioning are common in pa-
tients with PTSD (39). Of note, the recent NAS report
highlighted regulatory barriers to cannabis research as
a primary impediment (33).
Although cannabis is increasingly available for
treating PTSD, evidence examining its benefits and
harms in patients with this disorder is insufficient. Find-
ings from RCTs are needed to help determine whether
and to what extent cannabis may improve PTSD symp-
toms, and further studies also are needed to clarify
harms in patients with PTSD.
