Summary
There are approximately 8.5 million Jehovah’s Witnesses and around 150,000 live in Great Britain and
Ireland. Based on their beliefs and core values, Jehovah’s Witnesses refuse blood component transfusion
(including red cells, plasma and platelets). They regard non-consensual transfusion as a physical
violation. Consent to treatment is at the heart of this guideline. Refusal of treatment by an adult with
capacity is lawful. The reasons why a patient might refuse transfusion and the implications are examined.
The processes and products that are deemed acceptable or unacceptable to Jehovah’s Witnesses are
described. When a team is faced with a patient who refuses transfusion, a thorough review of the clinical
situation is advocated and all options for treatment should be explored. After discussion, a plan should
then be made that is acceptable to the patient and appropriate consent obtained. When agreement
cannot be reached between the doctor and the patient, referral for a second opinion should be
considered. When the patient is a child, the same strategy should be used but on occasion the clinical
team may have to obtain legal help.

What other guideline statements are
available on this topic?
The Association of Anaesthetists published a guideline
‘Management of anaesthesia for Jehovah’s Witnesses’ in
2005 [1]; this document supersedes that. The Fifth Edition
of
the
Transfusion
Handbook
from
JPAC
(Joint
UK
Blood Transfusion and Tissue Transplantation Services
Professional Advisory Committee) was published in 2013;
Chapter 12 deals with this topic [2]. ‘Caring for patients
who refuse blood’ was published by the Royal College of
Surgeons in 2016 [3].
Why were these guidelines developed?
Patient blood management (PBM) is now commonly
employed [4]; the management of Jehovah’s Witnesses is
similar to PBM measures, with efforts made to minimise
blood loss, use of cell salvage (CS) and adoption of lower
transfusion triggers. The ethical and legal framework
regarding consent has also changed. Refusal of blood
transfusion is not limited to Jehovah’s Witnesses and so the
principles in this document may be applied in those
circumstances.
How and why does this statement differ
from existing guidelines?
This document brings together current legal and clinical
expertise
with
the
views
of
the
Jehovah’s
Witness
community to provide a current practical guide to clinicians
faced with this clinical situation. The contribution of the
Jehovah’s Witness community means the information on
the attitudes and actions of the members of the faith is
current and accurate.
Recommendations
1
Patients should be given a clear explanation of the blood
products that the medical team looking after them
consider might be required during or after surgery, and
the risks involved if they refuse. Discussion of alternative
treatments should be undertaken if available.
2
It should be clearly documented in the medical record
which
treatments
and/or
procedures
the
patient
consents to and which they do not.
3
At least 6 weeks before elective surgery likely to be
associated with significant blood loss, the patient’s Hb
should be checked and if < 130 g.l�1, optimisation by
treatment with iron and/or erythropoietin should be
considered.
4
All relevant issues should be highlighted at the time of
the team briefing and during the surgical safety
checklist before induction of anaesthesia. A specific
checklist
recording
which
components/products/
procedures the patient will or will not accept (as in
Appendix S1) is important and should be available at
the time of the WHO Surgical Safety checks in the
operating theatre.
5
The majority of Jehovah’s Witnesses will accept intra-
operative CS – this should be discussed before surgery
and if agreed set up from the start of surgery. Consent
should be obtained.
6
The interventions promoted as part of a PBM approach
should be rigorously applied, including tranexamic
acid administration for major surgery.
7
After surgery, a comprehensive verbal and written
handover of the patient is essential. Staff should be
made aware of any adverse intra-operative events and
should understand and respect the wishes of the patient
that will have been discussed before the procedure.

 Introduction
It has been 12 years since the last edition of this guideline
was published [1] and much has changed, with advances in
bloodless surgery and the development of alternatives to
allogeneic blood transfusion. There has been an increased
focus on the management of patients who refuse blood,
including the Royal College of Surgeons’ recently published
good practice guide [3]. Patient autonomy and consent for
medical treatments have been discussed increasingly in
medicolegal fields with some pivotal cases of note since the
last edition, including those relating to blood transfusion
and capacity [5].
There are a variety of reasons why patients choose not
to accept blood components with the majority being due to
religious beliefs or worries about the risks of allogeneic
blood transfusion itself.
The principal aim of this publication is to provide a
practical peri-operative guide for clinicians managing
patients who refuse blood and a useful resource for patients
who wish to invoke this right.
It has been produced through collaboration of a
variety of professionals with medical representation from
anaesthesia, paediatric anaesthesia, transfusion medicine
and surgery, legal and patient representation from the
Jehovah’s Witnesses and other lay members.
Background to the beliefs of Jehovah’s
Witnesses regarding blood transfusion
‘Each is the proper guardian of his own health,
whether bodily or mental and spiritual. Mankind are
the greater gainers by suffering each other to live as
seems good to themselves, than by compelling each
to live as seems good to the rest.’
—JOHN STUART MILL [6]
A fundamental teaching of the faith of Jehovah’s
Witnesses is that life is sacred. They believe that life is given
by God, belongs to God and that He is the only one with the
right to determine how it should be used. This fundamental
premise is the basis for other courses of action: they do not
smoke because this is endangering life; they disapprove of
dangerous recreation and in times of war they are
conscientious objectors.
Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that the Bible is God’s
word, his communication with mankind, revealing his
personality, his thinking and his purposes for mankind
and this earth. Their beliefs and teachings are based on
various Biblical passages from both the Old and New
Testament.
Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that the Bible teaches that
life, which is held as sacred, is represented by the blood of a
creature, thus blood (representing life) acquires a sacred
status. They, therefore, take the view that taking into their
bodies (parenterally or enterally) the blood of another
creature violates Biblical law [7]. They believe that this is
consistent teaching throughout scripture, arguing that it
originated with a command to Noah, was repeated to the
people of Israel and reiterated to the first-century Christian
church. They have taken this view ever since blood
transfusion entered the realm of accepted medical practice.
It is adhered to even in the face of clinical advice that
allogeneic transfusion is necessary to preserve life. The
prohibition of blood transfusion is a deeply held core value
and is a sign of respect for the sanctity of life.
With regard to people who have been transfused, the
position of the Jehovah’s Witness leadership is that patients
who ‘wilfully and unrepentantly’ accept a blood component
transfusion may be considered as having chosen to leave
the faith. They state that emphasis is placed on support and
assistance for those who wish to remain adherents of the
faith. They also report that there is no rejection of those
transfused against their will, or in error, or of a child where
that action has been taken by clinicians in an effort to
preserve health and life.
Jehovah’s Witnesses have 36 Hospital Liaison Com-
mittees working within the UK and 1700 throughout the
world. These committees have been established to help
Jehovah’s
Witness
patients
in
preparing
for
elective
surgical
procedures
and
other
situations
such
as
pregnancy. They are available to provide pastoral and
liaison
support
even
in
emergency
situations.
The
members of these committees are available 24 h a day
both to patients and clinicians. Where the patient has
consented, they also assist clinicians in finding suitable
treatment
options
for
individual
Jehovah’s
Witness
patients. They have an international database of clinicians
which means they can put medical teams in contact with
those around the world who may be in a good position to
advise in a situation which is proving challenging.

 refuse a transfusion. Each patient should be given a clear
explanation
of
the
procedures
related
to
blood
transfusion that the medical team looking after them
consider might be required during or after surgery; of the
risks involved in not having these treatments; and of what
alternative treatments, if any, are available. The patient
may wish to discuss this with relatives, friends or a
member
of
a
Jehovah’s
Witness
Hospital
Liaison
Committee. However, in the case of an adult with capacity,
the decision as to which treatments to accept or refuse is
for the patient themself to make and the patient has a
right to confidentiality in respect of that decision.
A Jehovah’s Witness patient who has decided to
follow the teaching of his or her church in relation to blood
transfusion will not accept a transfusion of whole blood nor
of the primary components into which donated whole
blood is separated, that is, red cells, fresh frozen plasma
and platelets. Jehovah’s Witness patients who follow the
teaching of their church are permitted to accept products
derived by further processing of the primary blood
components. Accepting such products is considered to be
a matter of individual choice. Therefore, many Jehovah’s
Witnesses will accept products such as cryoprecipitate,
fibrinogen concentrate, prothrombin complex concentrate,
fibrin glue, platelet gel and human albumin solution.
Jehovah’s
Witness
patients
accept
recombinant
coagulation
factor
concentrates
and
drugs
such
as
erythropoietin and iron which are not derived from blood.
Pre-operative
donation,
that
is,
donation
of
the
patient’s own blood typically a few weeks before surgery
with the blood being given back during or after surgery is
not usually acceptable to a Jehovah’s Witness patient.
Acute normovolaemic haemodilution (ANH), in which
blood is taken from the patient into a bag containing
anticoagulant before or at the start of surgery, kept in the
operating room and given back to the patient during or
after surgery, is regarded as being a matter of individual
choice and may be acceptable.
Other procedures that are usually acceptable to
Jehovah’s Witness patients but matters of individual choice
include:
1
Cell salvage, either during surgery or postoperatively
2
Renal replacement therapy with haemodialysis or
haemofiltration
3
Cardiopulmonary bypass
4
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
In the case of CS, the equipment can usually be set up
as for non-Jehovah’s Witness patients, that is, there is
usually no requirement for a continuous connection from
the patient to the CS system and back to the patient. This is a
new
recommendation,
however,
some
patients
may
request, as a matter of personal preference, some form of
continuous connectivity.
It should be clearly documented in the medical record
to which treatments/procedures the patient consents and
those to which they do not consent.
The importance of consent
It is a core ethical and legal principle in Great Britain and
Ireland that an adult with capacity has an absolute right to
refuse treatment [8]. Although the legal frameworks differ,
the central concepts are the same. An adult patient with
capacity can give consent to a procedure while withholding
consent for specific aspects of management, such as the
administration of blood components. For so long as the
patient does not give that consent, the bar to the provision
of that treatment is absolute. Treatment in the face of such a
bar is unlawful and can give rise to both civil and criminal
liability, as well as professional sanctions.
A patient does not need to give a reason for
refusing consent, but where refusal may lead to a loss
of life or serious harm, it is good practice to ensure
that there is specific documentation, both of the fact of
refusal and of the patient’s awareness of its potential
consequences. In the process of completing that form
with the patient, medical professionals should consider
whether there is any indication that the patient’s refusal
is the result of coercion or undue pressure from any
other person. However, medical professionals should
equally be careful not to seek to influence a patient to
take a course of action which is not in keeping with
the
patient’s
wishes
and
values.
The
anaesthetic
induction room or the operating theatre is not the
appropriate venue for discussing consent in the elective
situation [8].
In England and Wales, an adult patient with capacity
can make a legally binding advance decision to refuse
specific medical treatment which would take effect if they
have lost the capacity to consent to or refuse that treatment
or those treatments. An advance decision to refuse life-
sustaining treatment must be in writing, must be witnessed
and must make clear that it is to apply to the treatment even
if life is at risk. [9] Advance decisions are recognised in
different ways in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the
Republic of Ireland, with the position in both Northern
Ireland and the Republic of Ireland being subject to change
at the time of writing [8].

 Treatment where the patient has lost capacity
In England and Wales, where a patient has lost capacity to
accept or refuse treatment, then whether that treatment will
be given depends on whether the patient has made an
advance decision:
1
If the treatment falls fully within the terms of the
advance decision, clinicians must respect its terms
unless there is good evidence that the patient did
not have capacity to make the advance decision, or
that the patient has changed his/her mind since
signing it.
2
If there is no valid and applicable advance decision,
then the decision as to which treatment to give will be
made on the basis of the patient’s best interests. ‘Best
interests’ encompasses not merely the patient’s clinical
interests, but their wishes, feelings, beliefs and values:
the purpose of any best interests decision is to make
the decision that is right for that patient as an individual
human being [10]. Even where a patient has not made
an explicit advance decision, if it is known that the
patient would have refused to give consent to a specific
treatment, it is likely that provision of that treatment
would not be in the patient’s best interests, and
therefore unlawful. [11]
The model for decision making in the absence of a
binding advance decision differs in each of Scotland,
Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland [8], but under
each framework weight must always be placed upon the
patient’s known previous wishes and feelings in relation to
the proposed treatment.
Centres and procedures
When recommending treatment, clinicians should consider
the additional risk posed by the patient’s refusal of blood
component transfusion. If appropriate, interventions asso-
ciated with reduced blood loss should be offered and
discussed with patients. Likewise, the impossibility to resort
to
transfusion
may
render
non-operative
treatment
preferable to surgery in selected cases.
Centres managing patients who refuse allogeneic
transfusion should make sure that alternative treatment
modalities are available, in particular, interventional or
surgical
procedures
known
to
be
associated
with
comparatively low blood loss. Examples of such procedures
include endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms (vs. open
repair) [12], laser transurethral prostatectomy (vs. standard
transurethral prostatectomy) [13] and off-pump coronary
artery bypass (vs. on-pump coronary artery bypass) [14].
Patients may wish to be considered for referral to other
centres where alternative techniques that they consider
desirable are practised.
Centres
managing
patients
who
refuse
allogeneic
transfusion should identify clinicians with special knowledge
and expertise in blood conservation within their departments
of haematology, surgery and anaesthesia. These clinicians
should be routinely consulted when planning surgical
treatment of patients who refuse allogeneic transfusion, to
plan individual blood conservation strategies. Likewise,
immediate advice should be sought when such patients are
admitted with a condition that could result in significant
blood
loss,
as
early
interventional
treatment
may
be
appropriate in many cases which would be normally treated
expectantly.
Clinical management for elective
surgery
This section will discuss the management of patients who
refuse transfusion in whom major surgery is planned
(defined as blood loss > 500 ml possible or likely). Most of
the recommendations are included in PBM guidelines [15].
Pre-operative
A pre-operative multidisciplinary discussion is mandatory,
for planning purposes. This discussion should include, as a
minimum, a senior surgeon, a senior anaesthetist and a
senior haematologist. The Hospital Liaison Committee may
also be consulted, with the patient’s consent.
During the pre-admission phase, it is important to
optimise red cell mass as much as possible to reduce the
effect of bleeding and haemodilution on haemoglobin
levels [16]. In most circumstances, surgery should be
postponed until haemoglobin (Hb) levels have been
optimised. It is also important to investigate any bleeding or

 clotting issues, especially if there is a history of bleeding or
bruising after surgical or dental procedures in the past.
Consideration should also be given to discontinuing
anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs. Avoid unnecessary
blood tests, consider using paediatric blood sampling
bottles for various tests to minimise blood loss.
The following investigations are recommended: full
blood count (FBC); B12 and folate; iron studies (ferritin and
transferrin saturations); clotting screen; and fibrinogen
(Table 1) [17].
At least 6 weeks before surgery (may not be possible in
elective cancer surgery), the patient’s Hb level should be
checked and if < 130 g.l�1 in all adults [18], the patient
should be assessed and treatment considered. If iron
deficiency (absolute or functional), low iron stores or iron
sequestration is diagnosed, iron treatment is indicated [19].
Oral iron may be considered, in which case the patient’s Hb
should be re-checked 4 weeks after starting treatment. If
< 6 weeks’ time is available until surgery is planned, surgery
is urgent or the patient does not respond to oral iron and
their Hb is still < 130 g.l�1, intravenous (i.v.) iron therapy
should be administered [20]. The use of recombinant
erythropoietin (EPO) together with i.v. iron therapy may also
be considered if Hb < 130 g.l�1 and ferritin > 100 lg.l�1
[21, 22]. A checklist should be completed before admission
to ensure pre-operative optimisation is complete (Online
Supporting Information, Appendix S1).
Intra-operative
All relevant issues should be highlighted at the time of the
team brief and during the surgical safety checklist before
the start of anaesthesia. We recommend that the question
‘is everyone aware of the answers to the blood transfusion
checklist (Online Supporting Information, Appendix S2)
and the techniques we will use to minimise blood loss in this
case?’ is added to the WHO Surgical Safety checklist for
patients who refuse blood.
Consider acute normovolaemic haemodilution [23];
blood is siphoned off by gravity into a collection bag
containing anticoagulant, and replaced with crystalloid or
colloid solution; if crystalloid is used it is likely that a larger
volume will need to be administered than the volume of
blood withdrawn in order to maintain normovolaemia.
Surgical blood loss, therefore, has a lower haematocrit and
the blood removed from the patient is re-infused during or
at the end of surgery. Local policy and guidelines should be
in place for acute normovolaemic haemodilution.
Use paediatric blood sampling bottles or in-line
patient monitoring if available. Point-of-care tests, for
example, arterial or venous blood gas sampling and
thromboelastometry/thromboelastography
should
be
employed
[24].
Controlled
hypotension
may
be
considered.
Efforts
should
be
made
to
maintain
normothermia. Tranexamic acid should be administered
intravenously
and
CS
considered
for
all
surgical
procedures if blood loss >500 ml is possible/likely [25,
26]. In cancer surgery, a leucofilter should be used with
CS.
If bleeding becomes clinically significant, the use of
point-of-care testing, such as rotational thromboelas-
tography or thromboelastometry (TEG or ROTEM) to
guide management, if available, is recommended. The
administration
of
fresh
frozen
plasma
or
platelet
concentrate
is
not
normally
accepted
by
Jehovah’s
Witness patients, but cryoprecipitate may be acceptable.
Other potentially acceptable therapeutic options include
prothrombin complex concentrate, which contains factors
2, 7, 9 and 10, and fibrinogen concentrate. Raising the
fibrinogen concentration with fibrinogen concentrate or
cryoprecipitate can partially compensate for the effect of
a
low
platelet
count
on
haemostasis.
Desmopressin
0.3 lg.kg�1 intravenously may also improve haemostasis
by
increasing
large
vWF
multimers,
and
possibly
improving procoagulant platelet activity. Recombinant
factor 7 should only be considered as a ‘last resort’
treatment due to the excess of prothrombotic events [27].
Postoperative management
A comprehensive verbal and written handover of the
patient to recovery, critical care and/or ward staff is
essential. They should be made aware of any adverse
intra-operative events and should understand and respect
the wishes of the patient that have been discussed before
the procedure.
Postoperative aims are to minimise ongoing blood
loss, promote haemostasis, correct any coagulation defects
and optimise oxygen delivery and consumption [28]. The
need for each blood test should be carefully considered
according to the individual clinical situation [29]. The
volume of blood samples should be minimised by using
paediatric sampling tubes if possible, and point-of-care
testing should be available.
Following
surgical
procedures
that
employed
a
tourniquet intra-operatively there may be excessive blood
loss after its release that may continue into the postoperative
period. In
these
situations,
postoperative
CS
can
be
employed. In case of bleeding, a postoperative dose of
intravenous tranexamic acid (1 g) should be considered.

 Children and adolescents
Children aged 0–15, England and Wales
The children of Jehovah’s Witnesses (up until their 16th
birthday) or children whose parents do not want their child to
receive a blood transfusion or other blood components may
present for elective or emergency surgery. Most techniques
used
in
adults
to
reduce
intra-operative
transfusion
(including CS) can, with suitable technical adaption, be
applied to children and infants. In general, consent for
surgery from at least one of those with parental responsibility
will be required, and the issue of transfusion will also need to
be discussed with those with parental responsibility. In
instances
where
the
views
of
those
with
parental
responsibility differ from one another, it may be necessary to
obtain legal advice. A senior anaesthetist should be involved
in the pre-operative discussion with the family and the
surgical multidisciplinary team (MDT). The parents’ and the
surgical team’s views on the relative risks of blood transfusion
and the risks of withholding blood products should be
discussed in detail. This discussion should clarify the peri-
operative management options, and is likely to conclude:
1
Blood and blood component therapy is likely to be
required during surgery and consent for this is obtained.
2
There is a very low risk of life-threatening haemorrhage
and all sensible precautions will be taken. The team
should make clear that, on rare occasions, the situation
may change dramatically between the point at which
consent is given on the basis of this agreement and
surgery such that transfusion may become necessary.
3
There is an absolute refusal by the parents of any form of
blood component therapy, regardless of the risk to the
child’s life.
4
There is a more nuanced permission, the conditions of
which are clear to both the parents and the surgical
team, where some blood components or products,
drugs or other techniques may be used.
It will be clear to the surgical MDT what parameters
they will be working to. In elective surgery, this will allow
appropriate pre-operative planning and preparation for
surgery. Should the MDT feel, after discussion, that they
cannot
work
under
the
proposed
constraints,
then
discussion with another appropriately skilled team (or
referral to that team) should be considered. The family
should be informed and this must be recorded in the
notes. The duty of the physician is to act in the best
interests of the child. This has usually been considered by
the courts to require them to provide a blood transfusion
even in the face of parental refusal, although this is not an
absolute rule. Parents usually want an assurance that their
beliefs are respected, and that the team will do all they can
to avoid transfusion. On this basis, consent forms are
signed so that treatment can proceed. It is essential that
doctors make every effort to accommodate beliefs rather
than resorting to the most obvious medical option when
that is contrary to the patient’s or parents’ wish, or look to
the courts as the first resort. When discussion, negotiation
and consideration of other options fail to resolve the
situation, the treating hospital should apply to the High
Court
for
an
order
providing
legal
permission
for
treatment in the face of parental refusal. In an urgent or
dynamic situation, blood should be given to minimise the
threat to life or prevent lasting disability in the child, while
such an application is made.
In some cases, a child (0–15 years) may be ‘Gillick’
competent to make a decision about blood transfusion: that
is, able to understand the proposal to administer blood; to
retain and use or weigh this information. Establishing his/
her competence in this way, the child can give (or refuse)
their consent to transfusion unaided by their parents. If a
competent child consents to blood transfusion, their
parents have no authority to override their consent.
Although it seems unlikely that a hospital would seek a court
declaration in this situation, it would be prudent to discuss
the position with the hospital’s solicitors before overriding
the parents’ strongly held objections.
In the reverse circumstances, where a competent child
refuses to consent to blood transfusion, those with parental
responsibility can override that decision if transfusion is
deemed
to
be
in
their
best
interests.
Nonetheless,
compelling a competent child to undergo a transfusion is a
serious affront to his or her human rights, and a prior referral
to a court is strongly recommended, if needs be by
telephone. If both the competent child and those with
parental responsibility refuse consent for transfusion, an
application to the court is required, seeking a declaration that
the need for consent is set aside, and that administration of
blood is lawful; usually under Section 8 of the Children’s Act
1989. If circumstances are elective, then this will be dealt with
in person in court; but in an emergency, the High Court can
be contacted by telephone, if needs be out of hours. If there
is no time to telephone, clinicians should administer the
blood if it is in the child’s interests to do so.
Children aged 16 and 17 in England and Wales
A young person of 16 or 17 years has the same ability as an
adult to consent to or refuse medical treatment if they have
the mental capacity to do so, with two exceptions:

they cannot make an advance decision to refuse
medical treatment (or grant a lasting power of attorney
to a person to consent or refuse on their behalf at a point
when they do not have capacity); and
2
a court can override their refusal even if they have
capacity.
Although old legal cases suggest that a person with
parental responsibility can consent on behalf of a 16/17-
year-old
who
has
capacity
and
is
refusing
medical
treatment, it is doubtful that the so-called ‘scope of parental
responsibility’ still extends to giving such consent in the
particular context of blood transfusions. It is, therefore,
strongly suggested that clinicians should not rely upon
parental consent in such a situation but rather should make
an application to the High Court.
The likelihood that the court will overturn that refusal
will diminish the closer the child is to age 18.
Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland
The principles set out above by reference to the position in
England and Wales are also – broadly – applicable in
relation to the legal frameworks that apply in each of
the other jurisdictions covered by this guidance, which
in the case of Northern Ireland and the Republic of
Ireland are subject to change at the time of writing [8].
However, in Scotland neither parents nor the court can
override the refusal of treatment made by a competent
person over the age of 16. In Scotland, a child under
16 years has legal capacity to consent on his/her own
behalf to any surgical, medical or dental procedure or
treatment where, in the opinion of a qualified medical
practitioner
attending
him/her,
he/she
is
capable
of
understanding the nature or possible consequences of
the procedure or treatment (Section 2(4) of the Age of
Legal
Capacity
(Scotland)
Act
1991).
Although
the
position has not been definitively established by the
courts, it would appear that this capacity also extends to
the right to refuse treatment and that neither parents
nor
the
court
can
override
the
refusal
of
such
a
competent child.
