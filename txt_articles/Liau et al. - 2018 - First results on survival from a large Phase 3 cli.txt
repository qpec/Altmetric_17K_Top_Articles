Abstract 
Background: Standard therapy for glioblastoma includes surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide. This Phase 3 trial 
evaluates the addition of an autologous tumor lysate‑pulsed dendritic cell vaccine  
(DCVax®‑L) to standard therapy for 
newly diagnosed glioblastoma.
Methods: After surgery and chemoradiotherapy, patients were randomized (2:1) to receive temozolomide plus 
DCVax‑L (n = 232) or temozolomide and placebo (n = 99). Following recurrence, all patients were allowed to receive 
DCVax‑L, without unblinding. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS); the secondary endpoint was 
overall survival (OS).
Results: For the intent‑to‑treat (ITT) population (n = 331), median OS (mOS) was 23.1 months from surgery. Because 
of the cross‑over trial design, nearly 90% of the ITT population received DCVax‑L. For patients with methylated 
MGMT (n = 131), mOS was 34.7 months from surgery, with a 3‑year survival of 46.4%. As of this analysis, 223 patients 
are ≥ 30 months past their surgery date; 67 of these (30.0%) have lived ≥ 30 months and have a Kaplan‑Meier (KM)‑
derived mOS of 46.5 months. 182 patients are ≥ 36 months past surgery; 44 of these (24.2%) have lived ≥ 36 months 
and have a KM‑derived mOS of 88.2 months. A population of extended survivors (n = 100) with mOS of 40.5 months, 
not explained by known prognostic factors, will be analyzed further. Only 2.1% of ITT patients (n = 7) had a grade 3

Background
Glioblastoma is the most aggressive primary malig-
nant brain tumor in adults [1]. Standard of care (SOC) 
consists of surgical resection followed by 6 weeks of 
daily radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide, then 
monthly temozolomide [2]. Median overall survival 
(mOS) under this SOC is only 15–17 months [2, 3], 
and ≤ 5% of patients are alive at 5 years [3]. Loco-regional 
therapy with alternating electric fields has recently shown 
an increase in median PFS (mPFS) to 6.7 months and 
mOS to 20.9 months from randomization, respectively 
[4]. However, there has been no material advance in sur-
vival with systemic therapies since the addition of temo-
zolomide 12 years ago, despite investigations with many 
diverse agents [2, 5–10].
Immunotherapy is an appealing strategy because of the 
potential ability for immune cells to traffic to and destroy 
infiltrating tumor cells. Dendritic cells (DCs) are central 
to the immune system as key regulators of immune tol-
erance and immunity [11]. For more than a decade, our 
group and others have been testing active vaccination 
strategies, such as DCs pulsed with tumor lysates or syn-
thetic peptides to induce antitumor immunity in glioblas-
toma patients [12, 13]. We have previously demonstrated 
the effectiveness of DC vaccination in pre-clinical models 
[14–16], and early stage clinical trials have shown sub-
stantial promise [17–19].
In this report, we describe the blinded interim data of 
the overall ITT patient population enrolled in a Phase 3 
randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clini-
cal trial of an autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic 
cell vaccine  
(DCVax®-L) for newly diagnosed glio-
blastoma. To date, we have not yet reached sufficient 
events (i.e., deaths) in this trial to justify unblinding. 
Nevertheless, since the vast majority (86.4%) of the ITT 
population received the experimental DC treatment at 
some point during the trial because of the cross-over 
study design, analysis of the interim data may provide 
early insight into the impact of DCVax-L on overall 
survival. A final analysis of the data obtained in this 
trial following unblinding will occur once sufficient 
events of disease progression or death have occurred 
to fully elucidate patient survival data in the tail of the 
survival curve.
Methods
Study patients
Patients were eligible for this study if they were 
18–70 years of age and had newly diagnosed glioblas-
toma, as determined through central pathology review. 
Other eligibility criteria included Karnofsky Perfor-
mance Score (KPS) of ≥ 70 [20], adequate bone marrow, 
liver, and renal function, life expectancy of ≥ 8 weeks, 
no other prior malignancy within the last 5 years, no 
active viral infections, and sufficient resected tumor 
material to produce the autologous vaccine. Patients 
were excluded if they already had apparent early dis-
ease progression/recurrence or pseudo-progression at 
the baseline visit, similar to the inclusion/exclusion cri-
teria of other recent trials in glioblastoma [4, 21].
Study design and treatments
We conducted this study at over 80 sites in 4 countries: 
the US, Canada, Germany, and the UK. Patient recruit-
ment was initiated in 2007, and was paused from 2009 
to 2011 for economic reasons. The midpoint of enroll-
ment was reached in May of 2014, and the final patient 
was enrolled in November of 2015. The protocol was 
approved by the required independent ethics commit-
tees and institutional review boards. Written consent was 
obtained from all patients participating in the trial.
All patients underwent surgical resection and 6 weeks 
of chemoradiotherapy per SOC, prior to enrollment and 
randomization in the study.
Randomization was performed centrally and was strati-
fied by clinical site and MGMT  
(O6-methylguanine-DNA 
methyltransferase) gene promoter methylation status, 
which was determined by a central laboratory. Patients 
were randomized 2:1 to SOC plus autologous DC vac-
cine (DCVax-L; n = 232) or SOC plus placebo (n = 99). 
PBMCs were used as placebo control as these cells are 
visually indistinguishable from DC and are consid-
ered immunologically inactive. Patients in both arms 
or 4 adverse event that was deemed at least possibly related to the vaccine. Overall adverse events with DCVax were 
comparable to standard therapy alone.
Conclusions: Addition of DCVax‑L to standard therapy is feasible and safe in glioblastoma patients, and may extend 
survival.

continued to receive monthly adjuvant temozolomide 
(150–200 mg/m2/day × 5 days every 28 days), inter-
spersed with the DC vaccine or placebo treatments 
administered on Days 0, 10 and 20, then Months 2, 4 and 
8, and thereafter at 6-month intervals starting at month 
12. Each DCVax-L treatment involved a dose of 2.5 mil-
lion autologous tumor lysate-pulsed DCs administered 
intradermally in the upper arm, alternating arms between 
injection visits.
All patients were allowed to receive DCVax-L following 
tumor progression/recurrence, as well as other approved 
treatments per local practice. All parties (investigators, 
patients and sponsor) remained blinded as to which 
treatment each patient had received prior to crossover. 
All patients who chose this option were given the active 
treatment on a re-start schedule with immunizations at 
Days 0, 10 and 20, and then months 2, 4 and 8, and every 
6 months thereafter beginning with month 12, with Day 0 
being the day of the first vaccination post progression. To 
date, DCVax-L has been shipped for 286 patients (86.4%) 
in the trial.
Both the study treatment (DCVax-L) and placebo 
(PBMC) were prepared by Cognate BioServices, Inc. for 
all patients in the US and Canada, and by Cognate and 
the Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy together for 
patients in Europe, during the chemoradiotherapy period 
before the baseline visit. The production of DCVax-
L involved processing the resected tumor tissue into a 
lysate, and then collection, purification, differentiation, 
activation and loading of the autologous DCs. In general, 
approximately 2 g of tumor tissue was needed to produce 
the full ten doses for the 36-month treatment and follow-
up schedule. The vaccine was aliquoted in individual 
doses and cryopreserved at < 150 °C [22]. The doses were 
stored centrally, and shipped individually to the clinical 
trial sites.
Assessments
Baseline assessments included physical examination, neu-
rological examination, vitals, KPS, MRI of brain with and 
without contrast, hematology (CBC with differential, plate-
lets), and serum chemistries (calcium, magnesium, SGOT, 
SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, LDH, total bilirubin, BUN, 
creatinine, electrolytes, glucose). Blood was collected for 
serum markers of autoimmune disease (anti-DNA) and 
immune monitoring, at the baseline visit and at treatment 
visits throughout the trial. MRI brain scans were performed 
every 2 months, per SOC, after the baseline MRI until radi-
ological tumor progression. All MRI scans were evaluated 
centrally by 2 blinded independent radiologists, with adju-
dication by a third such radiologist if needed.
Adverse events were recorded prospectively according 
to the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology 
Criteria (version 3.0 NCI CTC), until 2 months after the 
last study treatment. Patients are followed for OS until 
death.
Statistical analyses
The study’s primary endpoint is PFS, and the secondary 
endpoint is OS. PFS has not yet been evaluated for this 
publication and will be the subject of later analyses to 
allow for central, multi-factorial assessment by an expert 
panel, using criteria currently emerging as appropriate 
for immune therapy in this patient population where pro-
gression can be complex to determine and pseudo-pro-
gression is a known confounding phenomenon. Analysis 
of the blinded interim data on OS of the ITT population 
(using SAS version 9.4) was performed 34 months after 
the midpoint of patient enrollment, and 16 months after 
the last patient was enrolled and randomized.
General descriptive statistics include the number of 
observed values, mean, standard deviation, median, and 
range values for continuous measures. For categorical 
variables, the number and percentage of subjects with 
a specific level of the variable are reported. For survival 
analyses, Kaplan–Meier (KM) curves were generated, 
yielding estimates of median survival times, along with 
the two-sided confidence intervals (95% CIs) and esti-
mates of survival at specific time points.
Results
Study patients
From July 2007 to November 2015, 331 patients were 
recruited in the trial, comprising the intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population. A flow diagram depicting the flow of 
patients through the screening and enrollment process is 
provided in Fig. 1. The median time from surgery to ran-
domization was 3.1 months.
The ITT population (n = 331) (Table 1) is similar to 
other recent glioblastoma trials [4, 21, 24], with 61% males 
(n = 202) and 39% females (n = 129), with 75.2% of the 
patients ≥ 50 years of age (range 19–73 years), and median 
KPS of 90. 63.1% of patients (n = 209) had gross total 
resection and 36.9% (n = 122) did not. The MGMT gene 
promoter was methylated in 39.6% of patients (n = 131) 
and unmethylated in 48.9% (n = 162), with information not 
available for 11.5% (n = 38; the missing data relates to the 
early patients enrolled a decade ago). Absolute lymphocyte 
count (ALC) was > 800 cells/mm3 in 48.6% of the patients 
(n = 161) and was < 800 cells/mm3 in 51.4% of patients 
(n = 170), a characteristic that has been associated with 
poor prognosis after radiation [23]. Patients with radio-
graphic evidence of disease progression at baseline were 
excluded, as they have also been excluded in other recent 
trials for newly diagnosed glioblastoma [4, 21, 24].

Since other treatments were allowed following disease 
progression, we assessed their usage in this trial. While 
on study, three patients (1%) had another resection, 103 
patients (31%) received bevacizumab, 53 patients (16%) 
received CCNU and 6 patients (1.8%) were treated with 
tumor treating fields. In multiple reported studies, nei-
ther bevacizumab nor CCNU have been shown to extend 
survival [9, 25].
Treatment outcomes
ITT population
At the time of this analysis, 108 the 331 patients (32.6%) 
were still alive. The mOS of the overall ITT population 
(n = 331) was 23.1 months from the time of surgery (95% 
CI 21.2–25.4), with 2 and 3-year survival rates of 46.2 
and 25.4%, respectively (see Fig. 2a and Table 2). Analy-
sis of patient survival relative to year of enrollment did 
not reveal a trend over time, nor meaningful differences 
between years.
Long tail among ITT population
With immune-based therapies, a key focus is on the tail 
of the survival curve [26]. Among the ITT patients with 
a surgery date ≥ 30 months prior to the data collection (n 
= 223), 30% (n = 67) have lived ≥ 30 months, and their 
KM-derived mOS estimate is 46.5 months. Among the 
ITT patients with a surgery date ≥ 36 months prior to 
the data collection (n = 182), 24.2% (n = 44) have lived 
≥ 36 months and their KM-derived mOS estimate is 
88.2 months.
MGMT status and extent of resection
In patients with methylated MGMT (n = 131), mOS was 
34.7 months from surgery (95% CI 27.0–40.7), with 2 and 
3-year survival rates of 66.7% and 46.4%, respectively. In 
patients with unmethylated MGMT (n = 162), mOS was 
19.8 months from surgery (95% CI 17.9–21.7), with 2 and 
3-year survival rates of 32.1%, and 11.0%, respectively 
(Fig. 2b and Table 2).
For patients with gross total surgical resection 
(n = 209), mOS was 25.4 months from surgery (95% CI 
Fig. 1 Recruitment, inclusion, and randomization of patients in the 
study. (1) Patients are screened prior to surgery, so glioblastoma 
(GBM) determination is made from pathological diagnosis 
after surgery. (2) Insufficient tumor lysate generated to meet 
threshold. (3) Progressive disease or pseudo‑progression (which 
are indistinguishable at this point) based on central review of MRI 
imaging at baseline post‑chemoradiation. (4) Patients who consented 
to tumor donation but then declined participation in trial prior to 
leukapheresis. (5) Includes deviations from standard chemoradiation 
protocol, history of prior malignancy, inadequate renal or bone 
marrow function, etc. (6) Includes drug product failure or insufficient 
drug or placebo manufactured to meet release criteria. (7) Includes 
clinical deterioration, declining Karnofsky performance status, or 
patient deaths. (8) Includes biopsy only, surgery canceled, or tumor 
tissue not processed after surgery

21.8–28.2), with 2 and 3-year survival rates of 51.2%, and 
29.9%, respectively. For patients with only partial surgical 
resection (n = 122), mOS from surgery was 21.1 months 
(95% CI 19.1–23.1), with 2 and 3-year survival rates of 
37.7%, and 18.0%, respectively (Table 2).
In patients with both MGMT methylation and gross 
total resection (n = 83), the mOS was 36.5 months (95% 
CI 31.5–46.5)—1.8 months longer than the mOS of 
patients with MGMT methylation and only partial resec-
tion (n = 48). In patients with unmethylated MGMT,

there was no statistically significant survival advan-
tage with gross total resection compared to only partial 
resection.
Unknown factors: sub‑group with extended survival
Approximately 30% of the ITT population (n = 100) 
showed particularly extended survival, with a KM 
derived mOS estimate of 40.5 months. This is not fully 
explained by known prognostic factors, as only some of 
these patients had positive prognostic factors: only 29% 
were younger than 50 years of age, 65.9% had methylated 
MGMT, 71% had a complete resection, and only 8% of 
these patients had all three positive prognostic factors. 
These patients will be the subject of extensive further 
analyses and research.
Safety and toxicity
Safety and toxicity data were assessed on a blinded basis 
for all 331 ITT patients. Following SOC chemoradio-
therapy, and before any DCVax-L treatment, lymphope-
nia was the most common adverse event, occurring in 
approximately 170 patients (51%) [23].
The DCVax-L treatment was well tolerated, with only 
7 ITT patients (2.1%) experiencing serious (NCI CTC 
Grades 3–4) adverse events that were deemed related 
or possibly related to the DCVax-L treatment. These 
included cerebral edema in 3 patients (0.9%), seizures in 
2 patients (0.6%), nausea in 1 patient (0.3%) and lymph 
gland infection in 1 patient (0.3%).
The rate of total adverse events with SOC plus DCVax-
L was comparable to SOC alone (Table 3). Non-serious 
adverse events that were considered possibly related to 
the treatment included injection site reactions, fatigue, 
low-grade fever and night chills.
Discussion
Although enrollment was completed in 2015, this trial, 
including both treatments and follow-up, is still ongoing 
and will remain blinded until sufficient events of disease 
progression and/or death have occurred to more fully 
elucidate the tail of the survival curve. To date, due to 
the crossover design, nearly 90% of the ITT population 
received DCVax-L at some point in the trial, due to the 
crossover design.
DCVax-L is administered by intra-dermal injection in 
the arm, six times in year one and twice per year there-
after. It thereby imposes only a minimal burden on the 
patient.
In the overall ITT population in this trial, the mOS of 
23.1 months from surgery compares favorably with the 
mOS of 15–17 months from surgery typically achieved

with SOC in past studies and clinical practice, as well as 
with the survival data with SOC treatment in the control 
arms of other trials in similar patient populations. For 
example, Weller et al. reported mOS of 17.4 months from 
randomization in the ITT population [21], and Stupp 
et al. reported mOS of 16.0 months from randomization 
in the ITT population [24].
In patients with a methylated MGMT gene promoter, 
the mOS of 34.7 months from surgery also compares 
favorably with SOC in past studies as well as with the 
mOS reported for the control arm SOC treatments in 
other recent glioblastoma trials in similar patient popu-
lations. For example, Stupp et al. reported for their con-
trol group an mOS of 21.2 months from randomization 
in a similar patient population [24]. The increase in 
survival in MGMT-methylated patients in the DCVax-
L trial raises the possibility of a cooperative effect from 
the combination of temozolomide chemotherapy and the 
DCVax-L active immune therapy [17].
The mutation status of the IDH1 gene has not yet been 
investigated for this trial, as this factor was not included 
in trial designs a decade ago when this trial began. It will 
be collected and analyzed later, but is unlikely to explain 
the overall survival results, as the mutation associated 
with prolonged survival occurs in less than 10% of newly 
diagnosed glioblastoma patients [27].
Beneficial effects of immune therapies are often 
observed at later time points, in the tail of the survival 
curve [26]. Although this Phase 3 trial requires fur-
ther maturation, a picture is beginning to emerge from 
the blinded interim data which is consistent with an 
extended survival tail. For example, among the patients 
(n = 182) who were ≥ 36 months past their surgery date 
as of the date of this analysis, 24.2% (n = 44) were alive 
for ≥ 36 months and have a KM estimated median sur-
vival time of 88.2 months. Thus, it appears that patients 
who survive past certain threshold time points may con-
tinue onwards to unusually long survival times, similar 
to the findings in our prior Phase I/II studies of this DC-
based vaccine [17–19]. Further maturation of the trial 
data is needed to more fully reveal the extent of the long 
tail of the survival curve.
DCVax-L has shown a benign safety profile in this 
Phase 3 study, as it has consistently done in prior early 
stage trials [17, 19], and in a large group of patients 
treated on a compassionate use basis [28]. The fact that 
only 7 of the 331 ITT patients (2.1%) experienced any 
grade 3 or 4 adverse events that were at least possibly 
related to the treatment makes this DC vaccine an espe-
cially well tolerated treatment.
With such a safety profile, this DC vaccine may be 
administered in a wide range of clinical settings, and 
can potentially be combined with a wide range of other 
treatment agents, including immune checkpoint inhibi-
tors and targeted therapies, without resulting in undue 
toxicities for patients such as have been seen with some 
other treatment combinations [29, 30]. Further studies to 
explore such combinations are warranted.
Conclusions
The addition of DCVax-L autologous dendritic cell vac-
cine to SOC is feasible and safe. Collectively, the blinded 
interim survival data suggest that the patients in this 
Phase 3 trial are living longer than expected. These find-
ings warrant further follow up and analyses.
