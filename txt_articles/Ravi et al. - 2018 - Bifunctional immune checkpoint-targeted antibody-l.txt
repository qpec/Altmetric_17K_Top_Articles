A majority of cancers fail to respond to immunotherapy with antibodies targeting immune
checkpoints, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) or programmed death-1
(PD-1)/PD-1 ligand (PD-L1). Cancers frequently express transforming growth factor-β
(TGFβ), which drives immune dysfunction in the tumor microenvironment by inducing reg-
ulatory T cells (Tregs) and inhibiting CD8+ and TH1 cells. To address this therapeutic chal-
lenge, we invent bifunctional antibody–ligand traps (Y-traps) comprising an antibody
targeting CTLA-4 or PD-L1 fused to a TGFβ receptor II ectodomain sequence that simulta-
neously disables autocrine/paracrine TGFβ in the target cell microenvironment (a-CTLA4-
TGFβRIIecd and a-PDL1-TGFβRIIecd). a-CTLA4-TGFβRIIecd is more effective in reducing
tumor-infiltrating Tregs and inhibiting tumor progression compared with CTLA-4 antibody
(Ipilimumab). Likewise, a-PDL1-TGFβRIIecd exhibits superior antitumor efficacy compared
with PD-L1 antibodies (Atezolizumab or Avelumab). Our data demonstrate that Y-traps
counteract TGFβ-mediated differentiation of Tregs and immune tolerance, thereby providing
a potentially more effective immunotherapeutic strategy against cancers that are resistant to
current immune checkpoint inhibitors.

enetic mutations accruing from the inherent genomic
instability of tumor cells present neo-antigens that are
recognized by the immune system. Cross-presentation of
tumor antigens at the immune synapse between antigen-
presenting dendritic cells and T lymphocytes can potentially
activate an adaptive antitumor immune response that is mediated
by CD4+ T-helper cells (TH1) and CD8+ cytotoxic effector cells,
and sustained by tumor-reactive central memory T cells1. How-
ever, tumors continuously evolve to counteract and ultimately
defeat such immune surveillance by co-opting and amplifying
mechanisms of immune tolerance to evade elimination by the
immune system1–3. This prerequisite for tumor progression is
enabled by the ability of cancers to produce immunomodulatory
factors that create a tolerogenic immune cell microenvironment3.
Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) is a multifunctional
cytokine that is overexpressed in a majority of cancers4. The high-
affinity binding of TGFβ to TGFβ receptor II (TGFβRII) recruits
TGFβ receptor I into a heterotetrameric complex that initiates
SMAD-mediated transcriptional activation or repression of sev-
eral genes that control cell growth, differentiation, and migra-
tion5. Besides promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition,
invasion, and metastases of tumor cells, TGFβ has a critical role in
regulating the adaptive immune system6–9. TGFβ suppresses the
expression of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), restricts the differentiation of
TH1 cells, attenuates the activation and cytotoxic function of
CD8+ effector cells, and inhibits the development of central
memory T cells8–11. Most significantly, TGFβ induces the
differentiation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), a sub-population of
immunosuppressive CD4+ T cells that express the interleukin-2
α-chain (CD25) and the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) transcription
factor12–18. TGFβ induces the expression of FOXP3, the signature
transcription factor that determines and maintains the functional
program of the Treg lineage19–23. FOXP3, in turn, induces the
expression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), an
immune-inhibitory receptor that restrains co-stimulation of
T cells, and Galectin-9 (GAL-9), a ligand that engages the T-cell
immunoglobulin
domain
and
mucin
domain-3
(TIM-3)
immune-inhibitory receptor, and triggers exhaustion or apoptosis
of effector T cells24–28. GAL-9 further interacts with TGFβ
receptors to drive FOXP3 expression in a positive-feed forward
autocrine loop involving SMAD3 activation to induce and
maintain Tregs29. This ability of TGFβ to skew the differentiation
of CD4+ T cells away from a TH1 phenotype toward a Treg
lineage has significant clinical implications, as the functional
orientation of tumor-infiltrating immune cells has a major impact
on the outcome of patients with cancer30. Whereas TH1 cells,
cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and central memory T cells are uniformly
and strongly associated with a longer disease-free survival,
infiltration of tumors with Tregs has been correlated with a poor
prognosis in patients with several types of cancer30–35.
Current clinical efforts to counteract tumor-induced immune
tolerance are focused on monoclonal antibodies, which counter-
act T-cell inhibitory receptors that function as immune check-
points, such as CTLA-4 or programmed death-1 (PD-1)/PD-1
ligand (PD-L1)36–41. The CTLA-4 blocking antibody (Ipilimu-
mab), two PD-1 antagonists (Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab),
and three PD-L1 inhibitors (Atezolizumab, Avelumab, and
Durvalumab) are currently approved in specific clinical indica-
tions for immunotherapy of cancers, such as melanoma, non-
small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, or bladder cancer.
Although a subset of patients with advanced cancers experience
durable remissions and prolonged survival in response to CTLA-
4 or PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors, the majority of patients
do not respond to such therapy42,43.
A potential limitation of T-cell co-stimulation by current
immune checkpoint inhibitors is a tumor milieu enriched with
TGFβ, which strongly correlated with FOXP3 expression in our
analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data set of diverse
human cancers, including melanoma and breast cancer. We
hypothesized that autocrine and paracrine TGFβ signaling in the
localized microenvironment of tumor-infiltrating T cells could
skew them toward Tregs and attenuate the activation of TH1 and
CD8+ immune effector cells, thereby limiting the therapeutic
efficacy of CTLA-4 or PD-1/PD-L1 antagonists44,45. As Tregs
express and employ TGFβ and Gal-9 to maintain their own
phenotype and function, enhancing the efficacy of immune
checkpoint inhibitors requires a strategy to specifically break this
hyperactive autocrine loop in tumor-infiltrating Tregs. To test
this hypothesis and address this therapeutic challenge, we
invented bifunctional antibody-ligand traps (Y-traps) comprising
an antibody targeting either CTLA-4 or PD-L1, which is fused at
the C terminus of the heavy chain (HC) to a TGFβRII ectodo-
main sequence to sequester and disable autocrine/paracrine TGFβ
in the target cell microenvironment (a-CTLA4-TGFβRIIecd and
a-PDL1-TGFβRIIecd)46,47–49.
We
find
that
a-CTLA4-
TGFβRIIecd is significantly more effective in reducing and
counteracting
tumor-infiltrating
Tregs,
activating
antitumor
immunity, and inhibiting tumor progression compared with the
CTLA-4 antibody, Ipilimumab. Likewise, a-PDL1-TGFβRIIecd
exhibits superior antitumor efficacy compared with PD-L1 anti-
bodies (Atezolizumab or Avelumab). Our data demonstrate that
Y-traps simultaneously disable immune checkpoints and coun-
teract TGFβ-mediated differentiation of Tregs and immune tol-
erance, thereby providing a more effective immunotherapeutic
strategy against cancers that fail to respond to current immune
checkpoint inhibitors.
Results
TGFβ signaling correlates with FOXP3 expression in cancers.
We used iPANDA, a bioinformatics software suite for qualitative
analysis of intracellular signaling pathway activation based on
transcriptomic data50,51, to assess the level of TGFβ signaling in
TCGA data sets of different types of cancer and investigate
whether the TGFβ pathway activation in tumors is correlated
with the level of expression of FOXP3, the signature transcription
factor of the Treg lineage. Analysis of transcriptomic data from a
skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) data set (n = 472), using skin
biopsy of healthy women (n = 122) as a reference, showed that
upregulation in TGFβ signaling strongly correlated with increased
messenger RNA expression levels of TGFB1 and FOXP3 (Fig. 1a,
b). The strong correlation between TGFβ pathway activation and
FOXP3 expression was also noted in a TCGA breast cancer data
set (n = 776), using normal breast tissue as a reference (Fig. 1c, d).
Among breast cancers, TGFβ pathway activation and corre-
sponding elevation of FOXP3 was especially striking in triple-
negative breast cancer (TNBC) (Fig. 1c), an aggressive subtype
that lacks expression of hormone receptors (estrogen receptor
(ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)) and HER2/neu, and has a
higher risk of metastases and death within 5 years of diagnosis.
Although TGFβ and PD-L1 can cooperate to induce expression of
FOXP3, expression of PD-L1 (CD274) mRNA did not exhibit a
corresponding or consistent correlation with FOXP3 mRNA
expression (Fig. 1d). The strong correlation of TGFβ activation
with FOXP3 expression supports a crucial role of autocrine/
paracrine TGFβ signaling in induction and maintenance of Tregs
in diverse cancers.
Design and bifunctional target binding of a-CTLA4-TGFβRII.

simultaneously target both CTLA-4 and TGFβ by fusing the C

 ligand-binding sequence of the extracellular domain of TGFβRII
via a flexible linker peptide (Fig. 2a, b). Protein identification of
the purified antibody from CHO-K1 cell supernatants was per-
formed by liquid chromatography Fourier transform tandem
mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) to confirm the amino acid
sequence of the HC of a-CTLA4-TGFβRII (Fig. 2b). SDS-
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under reducing (R)
and non-reducing (NR) conditions was used to compare the full-
length (FL), HC, and light chain (LC) of a-CTLA4-TGFβRII and
a-CTLA-4 antibody (Fig. 2c). MS analysis confirmed the expected
higher molecular weight of the HC of a-CTLA4-TGFβRII
(65.697 kDa) compared with the HC of a-CTLA-4 antibody
(49.256 kDa). The bifunctional ability of a-CTLA4-TGFβRII to
simultaneously bind CTLA-4 and TGFβ1 was confirmed by
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(ELISA),
wherein
a-
CTLA4-TGFβRII was added to CTLA-4-Fc-coated plates, fol-
lowed by recombinant human TGFβ (rhTGFβ1) that was detected
by a biotinylated anti-human TGFβ1 antibody (Fig. 2d, e). Unlike
a-CTLA-4, a-CTLA4-TGFβRII exhibited the additional ability to
compete with a TGFβ capture antibody for binding to TGFβ1
(Fig. 2f).
a-CTLA4-TGFβRII counteracts Tregs and TH17 differentia-
tion. The FOXP3 transcription factor governs the differentiation
and function of Tregs. The transcription factors SMAD3 and
nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) are required for acti-
vation of a FOXP3 enhancer, and both factors are essential for
induction of FOXP3 in primary T cells. TGFβ-activated SMAD-2/
3 cooperates with interleukin (IL)-2-activated NFAT to induce
FOXP3 expression and promote the conversion of naïve CD4+
T cells to FOXP3-expressing Treg cells (induced Tregs or iTregs)
that mediate immune tolerance19 (Fig. 2a). Consistent with these
observations, treatment with rhTGFβ1 induced the phosphor-
ylation of SMAD-2/3 and increased expression of FOXP3 in
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) costimu-
lated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28-coated beads and rhIL-2 (Fig. 3a,
left panel).
a-CTLA4-TGFβRII is designed to exploit the FOXP3-mediated
expression of CTLA-4 on Tregs to decorate the targeted cells with
a decoy TGFβRII ectodomain that captures and disables TGFβ in
their localized microenvironment (Fig. 2a, b). We examined the
ability of a-CTLA4-TGFβRII to inhibit TGFβ-induced SMAD-2/3
phosphorylation and expression of FOXP3 in human T cells.
Human PBMC were stimulated with rhIL-2 and anti-CD3/anti-
CD28-coated beads in the presence of rhTGFβ1 with or without
either a-CTLA4-TGFβRII or a-CTLA-4. Unlike a-CTLA-4, a-
CTLA4-TGFβRII counteracted TGFβ-induced SMAD-2/3 phos-
phorylation and FOXP3 expression in co-stimulated T cells
(Fig. 3a, right panel).
The in vivo effect of a-CTLA4-TGFβRII on Tregs was
examined
in
human
melanoma
tumor-bearing
NSG
mice
(NOD/Shi-scid IL-2rgnull) that were immune reconstituted with
tumor-matched human leukocyte antigen (HLA) A2 + human
CD34+ bone marrow (BM) cells. The production of TGFβ by
A375 tumor cells (842 pg per 106 cells per 24 h) and SK-MEL-5
tumor cells (513 pg per 106 cells per 24 h) was confirmed by
ELISA assay. Tregs in BM and tumor-infiltrating T cells isolated
from tumor-bearing mice treated with either a-CTLA4-TGFβRII
or a-CTLA-4 and their untreated counterparts were measured by
immunophenotype analysis. Compared with a-CTLA-4, treat-
ment of tumor-bearing mice with a-CTLA4-TGFβRII resulted in
a marked decline of FOXP3-expression in CD4+ cells (Fig. 3b).
A375 or patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX)-bearing mice
treated with a-CTLA4-TGFβRII exhibited a significant reduction
of tumor-infiltrating Tregs (CD4+CD25+CD127lowFOXP3+ cells)
compared to those treated with a-CTLA-4 (p < 0.001 for A375, p
< 0.003 for PDX1, and p < 0.02 for PDX2; Student’s unpaired t-
test) (Fig. 3c). These data show that a-CTLA4-TGFβRII counter-
acts FOXP3+ Treg specification in a TGFβ-enriched tumor
microenvironment.
As FOXP3 is instrumental for the suppressive function of
Tregs, the relative ability of a-CTLA4-TGFβRII and a-CTLA-4 to
counteract Treg-mediated suppression of tumor-reactive T cells
was also examined using tumor-infiltrated BM from a patient.

Fig. 1 TGFβ pathway activation correlates with elevated TGFB1 and FOXP3 mRNA expression in TCGA-SKCM and TCGA-BRCA data sets. iPANDA software
suite for analysis of intracellular signaling pathway activation based on transcriptomic data was used to estimate the level of TGFβ signaling in melanoma or
breast samples from TCGA-SKCM (n = 472) and TCGA-BRCA data set, respectively (n = 776). TCGA transcriptomic data from normal breast tissue (n =
114) or skin biopsy of healthy women (n = 122) was used as a reference after proper normalization. The TGFβ pathway activation scores for a 472
melanomas (metastatic and primary) and c 776 breast tumors (ER/PR positive, HER2 positive, and TNBC) are sorted from low to high. The corresponding
expression of TGFB1 gene, FOXP3, and CD274 is shown for each patient. The units on the color bar represent the pathway activation score or the fold
change in the gene expression on the logarithmic scale in comparison with the average normal control level. Correlation matrix for melanoma (b) and
breast cancer (d) are shown (numbers in plot indicate correlation coefficient value). Pairwise correlations between TGFβ pathway activation and message
for TGFB1, FOXP3, and CD274 were computed using the Pearson's correlation coefficient. The p-values were calculated with the null hypothesis that the

 infiltrating lymphocytes (aMILs)52,53 were CFSE labeled and
added to autologous BM that had been pulsed with either tumor
cell lysate (tumor-specific antigen) or nonspecific antigen in the
presence or absence of autologous CD4+/CD25+ Tregs isolated
from the same patient’s BM. Following culture of these cells for
3 days with or without either a-CTLA4-TGFβRII or a-CTLA-4,
tumor antigen-reactive T cells (CD3+/CFSElow/IFNγ+) were
quantified by immunophenotype analyses (Fig. 3d). As expected,
the addition of autologous Tregs suppressed the activation of
tumor antigen-reactive T cells (CD3+/CFSElow/IFNγ+) in anti-
CD3/anti-CD28-activated aMILs stimulated with tumor antigen-
pulsed autologous BM. a-CTLA4-TGFβRII was far more effective
than a-CTLA-4 in counteracting Treg-mediated suppression and
restoring activation of tumor antigen-specific T cells in the
presence of autologous Tregs (Fig. 3d). These data demonstrate
that a-CTLA4-TGFβRII is more effective than a-CTLA-4 in
counteracting Tregs in the tumor microenvironment.
The differentiation of CD4+ T cells into TH1, TH17, or iTreg
cell lineages is determined by the cytokine milieu54. Whereas
IFN-γ drives TH1 differentiation, TGFβ is required for differ-
entiation of both iTreg and TH17 cells. Although TGFβ
cooperates with IL-2 to induce iTreg differentiation13,55,56, TGFβ
promotes TH17 differentiation in the presence of proinflamma-
tory cytokines, such as IL-657–61. In contrast to TH1 cells that are
strongly associated with good clinical prognosis for all cancer
types, TH17 cells are associated with tumor-promoting inflam-
mation
and
autoimmune
pathology30,62–64.
As
a-CTLA4-
TGFβRII can render the targeted T cells incapable of responding
to TGFβ signals in their immediate milieu, we examined whether
a-CTLA4-TGFβRII also skews the differentiation of CD4+ T cells
away
from
TH17
cells
toward
an
IFN-γ-expressing

phenotype. Whereas the TH17 phenotype of CD4+ T cells

 CTLA-4, a-CTLA4-TGFβRII was able to abrogate the expression
of IL-17 in CD4+ T cells and switch them to an IFN-γ-expressing
TH1 phenotype (Fig. 3e).
Superior antitumor immunity and efficacy of a-CTLA4-
TGFβRII. As a-CTLA4-TGFβRII effectively counteracted tumor-
infiltrating Tregs in vivo, we examined its ability to increase
tumor-reactive IFNγ expression in T cells and inhibit tumor
growth in human melanoma tumor-bearing NSG mice that were
immune reconstituted with matched HLA A2+ human BM
CD34+ cells. Treatment with a-CTLA4-TGFβRII was significantly
more effective at inhibiting the growth of A375 tumors compared
with a-CTLA-4 (p < 0.004, Student’s unpaired t-test) or untreated
controls (p < 0.0001, Student’s unpaired t-test) (Fig. 4a, b).
Consistent with its superior antitumor efficacy, treatment of
A375-tumor-bearing mice with a-CTLA4-TGFβRII resulted in a
greater elevation in tumor-reactive IFN-γ-expressing CD8+ cells
compared with treatment with a-CTLA-4 (Fig. 4c). We next
evaluated the comparative antitumor efficacy of a-CTLA4-
TGFβRII, nonspecific IgG-TGFβRII, and the combination of a-
CTLA-4 and IgG-TGFβRII using the same model. Treatment of
tumor-bearing mice with a-CTLA4-TGFβRII was significantly
more effective at inhibiting tumor progression (p < 0.02, Stu-
dent’s unpaired t-test) (Fig. 4d), reducing FOXP3+ expressing
Tregs (p < 0.001, Student’s unpaired t-test) (Fig. 4e, left) and
elevating tumor reactive IFNγ-expressing CD8+ cells (p < 0.01,
Student’s unpaired t-test) (Fig. 4e, right) compared with the a-

a-CTLA-4 on TGFβ-induced SMAD-2/3 phosphorylation and expression of FOXP3 in human PBMC. PBMCs were cultured for 24–48 h with rhIL-2 (100 IU
ml−1) and anti-CD3/anti-CD28-coated Dynabeads in the presence or absence of rhTGFβ1 (2.5 ng ml−1) with or without either a-CTLA4-TGFβRII or a-
CTLA-4 (5 μg ml−1). b, c Flow cytometric analysis of the in vivo effect of a-CTLA4-TGFβRII or a-CTLA-4 on bone marrow (BM) and tumor-infiltrating Tregs
in human melanoma tumor-bearing NSG mice that were immune reconstituted with tumor-matched HLA A2+ human CD34+ bone marrow cells. Mice
engrafted with human CD3+ cells were inoculated subcutaneously with either human melanoma tumor cells (A375 or SK-MEL-5) or patient-derived
melanoma tumor xenografts (PDX-1 and PDX-2). Tumor-bearing mice (A375; SK-MEL-5; PDX-1; PDX-2) were randomized into groups and treated with
either a-CTLA4-TGFβRII or a-CTLA-4 (5 mg kg−1 i.p. weekly), or vehicle alone (untreated control). b Representative flow data of FOXP3 expression in BM

Effect of a-CTLA4-TGFβRII or a-CTLA-4 on the suppression of tumor-reactive T cells by autologous Tregs in tumor-infiltrated BM from a patient. Marrow-
infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs) stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28-beads and rhIL-2 were carboxyfluorescein N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (CFSE)
labeled and added to autologous BM that had been pulsed with either myeloma cell lysate (tumor-specific antigen) or nonspecific antigen in the presence
or absence of autologous CD4+/CD25+ MILs, with or without either a-CTLA4-TGFβRII or a-CTLA-4 (5 μg ml−1) for 3 days. Tumor antigen-reactive T cells
(CD3+/CFSElow/IFNγ+) were quantified by flow cytometry (three in vitro replicates for each experimental group). e PBMCs were stimulated with anti-
CD3/CD28 beads in the presence of IL17-skewing cytokines (10 ng ml−1 IL-6, 5 ng ml−1 TGFβ, 10 ng ml−1 anti–IFN-γ, and 10 ng ml−1 anti–IL-4) with or
without either a-CTLA4-TGFβRII or a-CTLA-4 (5 μg ml−1) for 3 days. Following addition of Leukocyte Activation Cocktail (2 μl ml−1 for 4 h), cells were
analyzed by flow cytometry for intracellular expression of IL-17 and IFN-γ in CD4 + T cells (three in vitro replicates for each experimental group). Asterisks
represent statistical significance between the a-CTLA4-TGFβRII and a-CTLA-4 treatments. Representative flow cytometric dot plots are shown

(67 ± 4 U l−1), alkaline phosphatase (68.5 ± 6 U l−1), total bilir-
ubin (0.25 ± 0.1 mg ml−1)) and demonstrated no loss of body
weight during the course of experiment. The superior antitumor
efficacy of a-CTLA4-TGFβRII compared with a-CTLA-4 was
further confirmed in immune-reconstituted NSG mice bearing
primary PDX (Fig. 4f). Accordingly, treatment with a-CTLA4-
TGFβRII also resulted in higher tumor-reactive IFN-γ-expressing
CD8+ cells compared to treatment with a-CTLA-4 in mice
bearing human melanoma PDX (Fig. 4g). The comparative
in vivo effect of a-CTLA4-TGFβRII and a-CTLA-4 on the dif-
ferentiation of tumor-infiltrating T cells into central memory
T cells (CD45ROhighCD62Lhigh) was also evaluated in tumors
collected from PDX-bearing immune-reconstituted mice. Treat-
ment with a-CTLA4-TGFβRII was more effective than a-CTLA-4
in increasing the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a
central memory phenotype (Fig. 4h). These results demonstrate
that TGFβ in the tumor microenvironment reduces tumor-
reactive IFN-γ-expressing CD8+ cells and tumor-infiltrating
central memory T cells, and that a-CTLA4-TGFβRII is required
to effectively counteract these effects by rendering the targeted
T cells incapable of responding to autocrine/paracrine TGFβ
signals in their immediate milieu.
a-CTLA4-TGFβRII is more effective than a-CTLA-4 and
a-PD1. Besides CTLA-4, engagement of PD-1 by PD-L1
expressed on tumor cells or T cells also inhibits antitumor
T cells. Although monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against PD-1,
such as Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab, are effective in some
patients, the vast majority of cancers fail to respond to either PD-
1 blockade or even dual checkpoint inhibition with a-CTLA-4
and a-PD-1. Therefore, we investigated the ability of a-CTLA4-
TGFβRII to elicit antitumor immunity and inhibit the growth and
metastases of cancers that are refractory to current checkpoint
inhibitors, such as TNBC. Approximately 15–25% of patients
with breast cancer have TNBC, an aggressive type that does not
respond to hormonal agents or targeted therapy and has an
increased risk of metastases. As TNBC is representative of a
tumor type that exhibits a TGFβ/FOXP3 signature of Treg-
mediated immune tolerance (Fig. 1c), we used human immune
reconstituted NSG mice bearing the bioluminescent human
MDA-MB-231-luc (D3H2LN) TNBC cell line that expresses
elevated PD-L1 (Fig. 5a, inset) and TGFβ (531 pg per 106 cells per
24 h) and exhibits enhanced lung metastases. Treatment of MDA-
MB-231-luc-bearing mice with either a-CTLA-4 alone or the
combination of a-CTLA-4 and a-PD-1 mAbs failed to inhibit
tumor growth or lung metastases compared with untreated

a-TGFβ (p < 0.04, Student’s unpaired t-test) (Fig. 5a, b), and was
more effective in inhibiting lung metastases (Fig. 5c). Consistent
with its superior antitumor efficacy, a-CTLA4-TGFβRII was
more effective in reducing Tregs, elevating tumor-reactive IFN-γ-
expressing CD8+ cells and increasing the CD4+ and CD8+ central
memory T cells compared with the combination of a-CTLA-4
and a-PD-1 mAbs (Fig. 5d).
Design and bifunctional target binding of a-PDL1-TGFβRII.
PD-L1 is overexpressed on tumor cells as well as tumor-
infiltrating T cells, where it cooperates with TGFβ to inhibit T-
cell activation and induce and maintain immunosuppressive Treg
cells. Although TGFβ and PD-L1 can cooperate to induce FOXP3,
our analysis of both TCGA data sets showed that the correlation
of TGFβ pathway activation with FOXP3 expression was sub-
stantially stronger than its correlation with PD-L1 (CD274)
mRNA (Fig. 1). These data suggest that PD-L1/PD-1 checkpoint
and TGFβ signaling exercise independent, yet cooperative
mechanisms of immune tolerance, thereby supporting a ther-
apeutic rationale for simultaneously counteracting both axes in
the tumor immune microenvironment.
Anti-PDL1-TGFβRIIecd (a-PDL1-TGFβRII) is a bifunctional
antibody–ligand trap that was designed to target PD-L1 and
simultaneously inactivate TGFβ by fusion of an extracellular
domain sequence of TGFβRII to the C terminus of the HC of
anti-PD-L1 antibody via a flexible linker sequence, (GGGGS)3
(Fig. 6a, b). SDS-PAGE of two different anti-PD-L1 antibodies
(Atezolizumab and Avelumab) and their corresponding anti-
PDL1-TGFβRII products (Ab1 and Ab2) under R and NR
conditions showed the expected higher molecular weight of the
HC of anti-PDL1-TGFβRII. Size exclusion-high-performance
liquid chromatography (SEC-HPLC) analysis showed a single
peak corresponding to purified a-PDL1-TGFβRII with no
aggregation (Fig. 6c).
The comparative ability of a-PDL1-TGFβRII and a-PD-L1 to
bind PD-L1 was evaluated by ELISA assay, wherein biotinylated
recombinant human PD-L1 (rh B7-H1-biotin) was added to
plates coated with a-PDL1-TGFβRII or a-PD-L1 antibody, and
detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-Avidin. Plates coated
with nonspecific IgG-TGFβRII showed no binding to PD-L1 and
served as a negative control. Each a-PDL1-TGFβRII (Ab1 and
Ab2) exhibited specific binding to rhPD-L1 with an efficiency
that was similar to the respective a-PD-L1 (Fig. 6d). The
comparative ability of a-PDL1-TGFβRII and a-PD-L1 to bind
TGFβ was evaluated by ELISA assay, wherein rhTGFβ1 was
added to plates coated with a-PDL1-TGFβRII or a-PD-L1 and
then detected by biotinylated anti-TGFβ1 and HRP-Avidin.
Plates coated with nonspecific IgG-TGFβRII and rhTGFβRII-Fc
served as positive controls to analyze the binding ability of the test
samples to TGFβ. In contrast to the respective a-PD-L1 that failed
to bind TGFβ, each corresponding a-PDL1-TGFβRII exhibited
binding to TGFβ with an efficiency that was similar to the positive
controls (Fig. 6e). The ability of a-PDL1-TGFβRII to simulta-
neously bind both PD-L1 and TGFβ was also evaluated by a
bispecific ELISA assay, wherein a-PDL1-TGFβRII or a-PD-L1
was added to PD-L1-Fc-coated plates, followed by rhTGFβ1 that
was detected by a biotinylated anti-human TGFβ1 antibody. In
contrast to the respective a-PD-L1, each corresponding a-PDL1-
TGFβRII (Ab1 and Ab2) exhibited simultaneous binding to PD-
L1 and TGFβ (Fig. 6f).
a-PDL1-TGFβRII is more effective than a-PD-L1 antibodies.
The comparative antitumor efficacy of a-PDL1-TGFβRII, a-PD-
L1, nonspecific IgG-TGFβRII, and the combination of a-PD-L1
and IgG-TGFβRII against human cancers expressing both PD-L1
and TGFβ was evaluated in either A375 (Fig. 7a, b) or MDA-MB-
231-Luc (Fig. 7c, d) bearing NSG mice reconstituted with human
CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Moreover, in the TNBC
model, independent experiments were conducted to compare two
different a-PDL1-TGFβRII antibody-ligand traps with their
respective a-PD-L1 antibodies (Atezolizumab and Avelumab)
(Fig. 7c). In vivo tumor growth curves (mean ± SEM) in both
tumor models demonstrated that treatment of tumor-bearing
mice with a-PDL1-TGFβRII was significantly more effective at
inhibiting the progression of A375 (p < 0.01, Student’s unpaired
t-test) (Fig. 7a) or MDA-MB-231-luc (p < 0.004, Student’s
unpaired t-test) (Fig. 7c) tumors compared with the respective a-
PD-L1 alone, IgG-TGFβRII alone, and the combination of a-PD-
L1 and nonspecific IgG-TGFβRII. Consistent with its superior
antitumor efficacy, treatment with a-PDL1-TGFβRII resulted in
significant inhibition of FOXP3+ expressing Tregs (p < 0.05,
Student’s unpaired t-test) (Fig. 7b, d: left) and a greater elevation
in percentage of tumor-reactive IFNγ-expressing CD8+ cells (p <
0.01, Student’s unpaired t-test) (Fig. 7b, d: right) compared with
treatment with the a-PD-L1 alone, IgG-TGFβRII alone, and even
their combination. Mice treated with a-PDL1-TGFβRII main-
tained serum hepatic enzymes within a normal range of liver
function and demonstrated no loss of body weight during the
course of experiment.
Discussion
Cancer immunotherapy is currently focused on targeting immune
inhibitory checkpoints that control T cell activation, such as
CTLA-4 and PD-140,42,43,65–67. Monoclonal antibodies that block
these immune checkpoints can unleash antitumor immunity and
produce durable clinical responses in a subset of patients with
advanced cancers, such as melanoma and non-small-cell lung
cancer42,43,67. However, these immunotherapeutics are currently
constrained by their inability to induce clinical responses in the
vast majority of patients. A key limitation of checkpoint inhibi-
tors is that they narrowly focus on modulating the immune
synapse but do not address the key molecular determinants that
are primarily responsible for immune dysfunction in the tumor
microenvironment3,6–8,10,54. Our data indicate that elevated
expression of TGFβ is a root cause of such T-cell dysfunction in
the tumor microenvironment. We find that autocrine and para-
crine TGFβ signaling fundamentally affects tumor-infiltrating
T cells by skewing the differentiation of TH1 cells toward a Treg
phenotype, attenuating the activation of CD8+ effector cells and
limiting the development of central memory cells. As Tregs
express and employ TGFβ to maintain their own phenotype and
function13,18,19,44,59–61,68, counteracting these deleterious cells
and restoring beneficial TH1 cells is contingent upon making
them impervious to such autocrine signaling. This poses the
therapeutic challenge of specifically breaking this TGFβ-driven
autocrine loop in tumor-infiltrating Tregs. Systemic TGFβ
antagonists fall short of interrupting autocrine signaling in Tregs,
as they lack preferential localization to T cells and fail to effi-
ciently compete with the native TGFβRII receptor for binding
TGFβ.

 CTLA-4 antibodies, such as ipilimumab, can target FOXP3-
expressing Tregs and counteract CTLA-4-mediated inhibition of
B7-CD28 interaction36. However, a-CTLA-4 fails to counteract
autocrine/paracrine TGFβ signaling, thereby resulting in NFAT/
SMAD3-mediated upregulation of FOXP319 and a paradoxical
increase in tumor-infiltrating Tregs in the TGFβ-enriched
immune microenvironment found in the majority of cancers45.
Our
data
demonstrate
that
a-CTLA4-TGFβRII
effectively
addresses
this
challenge
by
exploiting
the
FOXP3-driven
expression of CTLA-4 to not only disable the CTLA-4 check-
point, but also decorate the targeted Tregs with a decoy TGFβRII
ectodomain that traps TGFβ at the surface of the T cell, thereby
rendering them virtually unresponsive to autocrine or paracrine
TGFβ in their immediate milieu. As a result, a-CTLA4-TGFβRII
counteracts
autocrine/paracrine
TGFβ/SMAD3-dependent
expression of FOXP3, thereby reducing the differentiation and
suppressive activity of Tregs. By skewing CD4+ T cells away from
FOXP3+ Tregs or TH17 cells to a TH1-helper phenotype, a-
CTLA4-TGFβRII enables effective activation of antitumor CD8+
effector T cells. An especially attractive feature of a-CTLA4-
TGFβRII is its targeted ability to trap TGFβ at the surface of the T
cell in a CTLA-4-directed manner, thereby interrupting the
TGFβ-autocrine loop that drives FOXP3-mediated expression of
CTLA-4. This distinguishing feature allows a-CTLA4-TGFβRII to
enjoy a better therapeutic index compared with non-targeted
TGFβ antagonists or even combinatorial therapy with a CTLA-4
antibody and a systemic TGFβ antagonist that is not directed to
the T cell microenvironment. This unique ability to counteract
Tregs and correct immune tolerance in a TGFβ-enriched tumor
immune microenvironment enables a-CTLA4-TGFβRII to be
significantly more effective in activating antitumor immunity and
inhibiting tumor progression compared with a CTLA-4 antibody,
a PD-1 antibody, or even the combination of both mAbs. Inter-
estingly, a-CTLA4-TGFβRII was able to exhibit superior single
agent activity against PD-L1-expressing tumors and the addition
of a-PD1 antibody did not significantly enhance its antitumor
efficacy in the breast cancer model. Although the highly effective
counteraction of Tregs and immune tolerance by a-CTLA4-
TGFβRII was sufficient to inhibit tumor growth, this might have
obscured any potential value of combination therapy with a-PD1
during the course of the experiment. As IFN-γ-mediated upre-
gulation of PD-L1 has been shown to be a mechanism of adaptive
immune tolerance39,69, it remains possible that PD-1/PD-L1
blockade could potentially enhance the antitumor activity of a-
CTLA4-TGFβRII over a more extended treatment period or in
other tumor models.
Whereas CTLA-4 is highly expressed on Tregs, PD-L1 is
overexpressed on tumor cells as well as tumor-infiltrating T cells,
where it cooperates with TGFβ to inhibit T-cell activation and
induce and maintain Tregs70. As PD-L1 and TGFβ entrain
independent but cooperative mechanisms of immune tolerance,
autocrine and paracrine TGFβ signaling in the tumor immune
microenvironment may also limit the therapeutic efficacy of PD-
1/PD-L1 antagonists. Consistent with this notion, our data
demonstrate that a-PDL1-TGFβRII is significantly more effective
in inhibiting tumor progression compared with the correspond-
ing a-PD-L1 antibody due to its bifunctional ability to not only
block PD-L1/PD-1 interaction, but simultaneously interrupt
autocrine/paracrine TGF-β signaling in the localized micro-
environment of PD-L1 expressing tumor-infiltrating immune
cells and tumor cells.
Although humanized NSG mice used in this study exhibit a
functionally validated surrogate human immune system71, this
model supports the growth of human cancer cell line and PDXs

 even when they are not specifically HLA matched to the human
CD34+ HSC used for immune reconstitution72. The absence of
tumor rejection or inhibition of tumor progression in this model
demonstrates that there is no spontaneous anti-allogeneic or
tumor-specific immune response against such xenografts. How-
ever, as HLA-A*02 is the most highly prevalent HLA-A allele in
patients with melanoma and breast cancer (including tumors cells
used in this study), NSG mice were reconstituted with HLA-A*02
CD34+ HSCs. This was designed to ensure that HLA-A2-
restricted
TILs
recognize
HLA-A2-expressing
xenografts,
enabling generation of HLA-A2-restricted cytotoxic T cells. As
such, our models were used to assess the comparative ability a-
CTLA4-TGFβRII or a-PDL1-TGFβRII and their respective parent
antibodies (a-CTLA-4 and a-PD-L1) to counteract immune tol-
erance in the TME and activate antitumor immune responses.
Although these include HLA-A2-restricted responses against
tumor
antigens,
they
could
exclude
HLA-restricted
T-cell
responses to antigens presented by other class I or class II HLA
loci that may not be matched. The elicited immune responses
may not be restricted to tumor antigens, but also potentially
encompass anti-allogeneic responses. As such, our tumor models
stringently compare T-cell-mediated antitumor immune respon-
ses between treatment groups and controls under the same
conditions, rather than estimate the absolute efficacy of each
independent treatment.
Our preclinical studies indicate that both antibody-ligand traps
(a-CTLA4-TGFβRII and a-PDL1-TGFβRII) have a superior
therapeutic index compared with their parent immune check-
point inhibitors that are currently in clinical use. Although no
adverse events were observed in mice treated with either a-
CTLA4-TGFβRII or a-PDL1-TGFβRII, any novel immunother-
apeutic strategy that seeks to counteract Treg cells and unleash
antitumor immunity carries a potential risk of autoimmune
sequelae in patients. As such, the clinical translation of this
approach requires well-designed phase I dose-escalation trials to
carefully evaluate the safety of each novel agent, determine the
maximum tolerated dose, and identify the optimal therapeutic
dose and schedule that can elicit an antitumor immune response
without prohibitive immune-related adverse events. As elevated
TGFβ is an especially common denominator of immune dys-
function in many types of cancer, these Y-traps may provide an
effective immunotherapeutic strategy against cancers that fail to
respond to current immune checkpoint inhibitors by simulta-
neously disabling immune checkpoints and counteracting TGFβ-
mediated immune tolerance.
Methods
Correlative analysis of TGFβ pathway and FOXP3 expression. RNA sequencing
(RNA-Seq) data for 472 melanomas and 776 breast tumors were retrieved from
TCGA. As unlike the breast cohort, TCGA melanoma collection lacks data from
the healthy individuals, we have carefully selected a tissue specific normal control
cohort (accession number GSE85861) form NCBI GEO repository. RNA-Seq data
preprocessing and normalization steps were performed in R version 3.1.0 using
DEseq package from Bioconductor. To adjust for the possible batch and processing
effect, we have employed the XPN algorithm (R package, CONOR)73. The resulting
matrix contained mRNA expression information for over 20K genes across all
analyzed samples. Normalized gene expression data were loaded into iPANDA50,51.
The software enables calculation of the Pathway Activation Score (PAS) for each of
the 374 pathways analyzed, a value that serves as a quantitative measure of dif-
ferential pathway activation. A collection of 374 intracellular signaling pathways
(which cover a total of 2,294 unique genes) strongly implicated with various solid
malignancies was obtained from the SABiosciences (http://www.sabiosciences.com/
pathwaycentral.php), and used for the computational algorithm as described pre-
viously50,51. Calculated PAS values for TGFβ pathway were used for correlative
analysis with TGFB1, FOXP3, and PDL1 expression levels seen in the same patients.
Design of a-CTLA4-TGFβRII and a-PDL1-TGFβRII. Anti-CTLA4-TGFβRII was
designed by fusing the C terminus of the HC of a human anti-CTLA-4 antibody
(Ipilimumab) with a ligand-binding sequence of the extracellular domain of
TGFβRII (TGFβRII ECD) via a flexible linker peptide, (GGGGS)3. Anti-PDL1-
TGFβRII was designed to simultaneously target both PD-L1 and TGF-β by fusing
the C terminus of the HC of human anti-PD-L1 antibody (Atezolizumab and
Avelumab) with a ligand-binding sequence of the extracellular domain of TGFβRII
(TGFβRII ECD) via a flexible linker peptide, (GGGGS)3. The amino acid sequences
were codon optimized with GeneOptimizer (Life Technologies). Anti-gp120-
TGFβRII antibody was used as a non-specific IgG-TGFβRII control. Amino acid
sequences of all fusion antibodies used in this study are provided in Supplementary
Material. The complementary DNA for the antibody HC and the cDNA for the
antibody LC were gene synthesized and subsequently cloned into separate plasmids
(pEvi3; evitria AG, Switzerland) under the control of a mammalian promoter and
polyadenylation signal. Plasmid DNA was amplified in Escherichia coli and DNA
was purified using anion exchange kits for low endotoxin plasmid DNA pre-
paration. The plasmid DNAs for HC and LC were subsequently co-transfected into
CHO K1 cells with eviFect (evitria AG, Switzerland), and the CHO cells were
cultured in eviMake (evitria AG, Switzerland), a serum-free, animal-component-
free medium. Production was terminated once viability reached 75%, which
occurred at day 8 after transfection. The antibody-containing supernatant was then
harvested and antibody was purified at 20 oC by Protein A affinity chromatography
on a Bio-Rad BioLogic FuoFlow FPLC machine with subsequent gel filtration as
polishing and re-buffering step. The purified antibody was re-buffered into
phosphate-buffered saline, sterile-filtered, aliquoted, and frozen at − 80 oC. Protein
identification of the purified antibody from CHO cell supernatants was performed
by LC–MS/MS to confirm the amino acid sequence and size of the HC of a-
CTLA4-TGFβRII and a-PDL1-TGFβRII (Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics
Facility, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine). SDS-PAGE under R and
NR conditions was used to compare the FL, HC, and LC of a-CTLA4-TGFβRII
with a-CTLA-4, and a-PDL1-TGFβRII with a-PD-L1.
Bifunctional target-binding ability of fusion antibodies. The ability of anti-
CTLA4-TGFβRII antibody to simultaneously bind both CTLA-4 and TGFβ was
evaluated by a ‘double-sandwich’ ELISA, wherein anti-CTLA4-TGFβRII or anti-
CTLA-4 antibody (1 μg ml−1) was added to CTLA-4-Fc-coated plates, followed by
rhTGFβ1 (0–2,000 pg ml−1) that was detected by a biotinylated anti-human TGFβ1
antibody (R&D Systems). The positive standard curve (TGFβRII-Fc-coated plate)
was used to analyze the binding ability of the test samples. The ability of a-CTLA4-
TGFβRII to bind TGFβ1 was also evaluated by competition ELISA. The ELISA
plate was coated with the capture antibody (a-TGFβ, 1 μg ml−1), followed by
rhTGFβ1 in the presence of either a-CTLA4-TGFβRII or a-CTLA-4 (Antibody :
TGFβ1 ratio 1 : 1 to 100 : 1) for 1 h at room temperature. Each experiment was
performed twice, with triplicate wells for each indicated condition.
The comparative ability of anti-PDL1-TGFβRII and anti-PD-L1 antibody to
bind PD-L1 was evaluated by ELISA, wherein biotinylated recombinant human
PD-L1 (rh B7-H1-biotin; 0–100 ng ml−1; R&D Systems) was added to plates coated
with anti-PDL1-TGFβRII or anti-PD-L1 antibody (1 μg ml−1), followed by
detection with HRP-Avidin. Plates coated with nonspecific IgG-TGFβRII served as
a negative control to analyze the binding ability of the test samples. The
comparative ability of a-PDL1-TGFβRII and a-PD-L1 antibody to bind TGFβ was
evaluated by ELISA, wherein rhTGFβ1 (0–2,000 pg ml−1) was added to plates
coated with a-PDL1-TGFβRII or a-PD-L1 antibody (1 μg ml−1), which was
detected by biotinylated anti-TGFβ1 and HRP-Avidin (R&D Systems). Plates
coated with nonspecific IgG-TGFβRII and rhTGFβRII-Fc served as positive
controls to analyze the binding ability of the test samples to TGFβ. The ability of a-
PDL1-TGFβRII to simultaneously bind both PD-L1 and TGF-β was evaluated by a
bispecific ELISA, wherein a-PDL1-TGFβRII or a-PD-L1 antibody (0–100 ng ml−1)
was added to PD-L1-Fc-coated plates (1 μg ml−1), followed by rhTGFβ1 (100 ng ml
−1) that was detected by a biotinylated anti-human TGFβ1 antibody (R&D
Systems).
TGFβ-binding ability of a-TGFβ and IgG-TGFβRII. The ability of a-TGFβ (1D11)
and nonspecific IgG-TGFβRII (anti-gp120-TGFβRII) antibody to equally bind
TGFβ in vitro was evaluated by a standard ELISA assay (Supplementary Figure 1).
rhTGFβ1 (0–2000 pg ml−1) was added to the plates coated with either TGFβRII-Fc
(R&D Systems), a-TGFβ (Bioxcel), or IgG-TGFβRII (1 μg ml−1 each), and binding
to rhTGFβ1 was detected by a biotinylated anti-human TGFβ1 antibody (R&D
Systems). TGFβRII-Fc-coated plates were used as a TGFβ-binding positive control
(Supplementary Figure 1). To demonstrate that both agents were administered at
doses sufficient to saturate systemic TGFβ in vivo, sequestration of serum TGFβ
was assessed in A375 tumor-bearing NSG immune-reconstituted mice treated with
either a-TGFβ or IgG-TGFβRII (5 mg kg−1 per week) for 4 weeks (Supplementary
Figure 2). At the endpoint, serum was collected from tail bleed and levels of TGFβ
were detected using the TGFβ-1 Human ELISA Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific)
following the manufacturer’s protocol.
TGFβ-induced FOXP3 expression and Treg differentiation. Human PBMCs
(ALLCELLS) were stained with anti-CD3 and Glycophorin A to enumerate T cells.
Cells were cultured with rhIL-2 (100 IU ml−1) and anti-CD3/anti-CD28-coated
Dynabeads (Life Technologies) at a ratio of 1 : 3 (cell : bead) in the presence or
absence of 2.5 ng ml−1 rhTGF-β1 with or without either a-CTLA4-TGFβRII or a-

 CTLA-4 antibody (5 μg ml−1). Following culture for 24–48 h, cells were lysed and
subjected to immunoblot analyses with the following primary antibodies: FOXP3,
SMAD-2/3 (D7G7), or phospho-SMAD-2/3, and β-actin (Cell Signaling Tech-
nologies). On day 5, anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads were magnetically removed and
the number of Tregs (CD4+/CD25high/CD127low/FOXP3+) were enumerated by
flow cytometry. Cells were stained extracellularly with anti-human CD4-PE, anti-
human CD25-PE-CYTM5, and anti-human CD127-FITC antibodies (BD Bios-
ciences). The cells were then permeabilized (BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Kit) and stained
intracellularly with anti-human FOXP3-APC or the corresponding isotype control
mouse IgG1-APC (eBioscience). The stained cells were washed twice with FACS
buffer, run on the Gallios Flow Cytometer, and analyzed utilizing Kaluza Software
(Beckman Coulter).
Analysis of Treg suppressor function. Patient-derived tumor-infiltrated BM
(myeloma-BM) was stained with anti-CD3 and Glycophorin A to enumerate
T cells. Following activation for 7 days with rhIL-2 and anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads,
the cells were magnetically separated and stained with anti-CD3. Concurrently,
autologous Tregs were isolated from the same patient’s peripheral blood lym-
phocytes using anti-CD4/anti-CD25 beads (Miltenyi Biotechnology). The activated
T cells were CFSE labeled (Life Technologies) and added to autologous BM that
had been pulsed for 30 min in medium with or without either tumor-specific
antigen (tumor cell lysate) or nonspecific antigen (nonspecific cell lysate) and
plated in the presence or absence of the selected autologous Tregs. Following
culture for 3 days with or without either a-CTLA4-TGFβRII or a-CTLA-4 antibody
(5 μg ml−1), the cells were stained with anti-CD3 and anti-IFNγ. Tumor antigen-
specific T cells were considered as CD3+/CFSElow/IFNγ+.
Analysis of TH17 cell differentiation. PBMCs were co-incubated with anti-CD3/
CD28 beads (1 : 3 cell to bead ratio) in AIM-V medium (Invitrogen) in the pre-
sence of IL17-skewing cytokines (10 ng ml−1 IL-6, 5 ng ml−1 TGFβ, 10 ng ml−1
anti–IFN-γ, and 10 ng ml−1 anti–IL-4 (R&D Systems)) with either a-CTLA4-
TGFβRII or a-CTLA-4 antibody (5 μg ml−1). Following incubation for 3 days,
Leukocyte Activation Cocktail (BD Biosciences) was added at 2 μl ml−1 of cell
culture for 4 h. Cells were collected and stained extracellularly with anti-human
CD4 (BD Biosciences), permeabilized (BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Kit), and stained
intracellularly with IL-17 and IFN-γ antibodies (eBioscience). The stained cells
were washed twice with FACS buffer, run on the Gallios Flow Cytometer, and
analyzed utilizing Kaluza Software (Beckman Coulter).
Tumor cell lines and treatments. A375 and SK-MEL-5 human melanoma cell
lines were purchased from ATCC and maintained according to ATCC guidelines.
MDA-MB-231 is a metastatic human TNBC cell line with mesenchymal-like
morphology (Basal B-like). MDA-MB-231-Luc (D3H2LN) is a TNBC subline with
enhanced primary tumor growth and lung metastases that was derived from a
metastatic deposit of bioluminescent MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing firefly
luciferase. MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin.
All cell lines were periodically monitored for mycoplasma at Johns Hopkins
Genetic Resources Core Facility using the MycoDtect kit (Greiner Bio-One) and
authenticated using genetic fingerprinting (Identifiler, Applied Biosystems) before
use.
Treatment of NSG mice reconstituted with human CD34+ cells. Female
immune-deficient NSG mice (NOD/Shi-scid IL-2rgnull)(4–8-week old) were irra-
diated at 200 cGy, followed by adoptive transfer of human BM CD34+ cells (7 × 104
per mouse) from a normal donor (HLA-matched to the tumor) (ALLCELLS). Mice
were tested for engraftment of human CD3+ T cells in peripheral blood obtained
via tail-bleed at 7–8 weeks following injection of CD34+ cells. The cells were stained
with anti-CD3-APC and anti-CD19-FITC antibodies. Mice demonstrating
engraftment of human CD3+ cells were inoculated with either human melanoma
tumor cells (A375 or SK-MEL-5) (2 × 106 cells subcutaneously), PDX (sub-
cutaneously), or human TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231-Luc) (2 × 106 in Matrigel;
mammary fat pad). At 10d following tumor inoculation, mice were allocated to
groups using blinded block randomization and treated (5 mg kg−1 intraperitoneally
(i.p.) weekly) with either vehicle alone (untreated control) or the following anti-
bodies: a-CTLA4-TGFβRII; a-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab); nonspecific IgG-TGFβRII (a-
gp120-TGFβRII); a-TGFβ (1D11); a-PD-1 (pembrolizumab); combination of a-
CTLA-4 and IgG-TGFβRII; combination of a-CTLA-4 and a-TGFβ; combination
of a-CTLA4 and a-PD-1; combination of a-CTLA4-TGFβRII and a-PD-1; a-
PDL1-TGFβRII (Ab1 and Ab2); a-PD-L1 (atezolizumab and avelumab); a-PD-L1
+ IgG-TGFβRII; and Vehicle alone (Control). Tumor size was measured weekly
blinded to the treatment group and tumor volume was calculated using the formula
(length × width × height).
Immunophenotype analysis of human tumor-bearing mice. Tumors and BM
were collected from tumor-bearing mice in each group for immunophenotype
analysis of T cells. Tumor samples were subjected to collagenase digestion for 20
min at 37 °C followed by red blood cell lysis. Tregs in tumor-infiltrating or BM
T cells were measured by flow cytometric analysis of CD4+CD25+CD127low
FOXP3+ cells, as described above. Tumor-infiltrating or BM T cells were stained
with anti-human CD3-PE, anti-human CD8-PE-CYTM7, anti-human CD45RO-
APC, and anti-human CD62L-FITC, and analyzed by flow cytometry to quantify
T cells with a central memory phenotype (CD45ROhighCD62Lhigh). To evaluate
tumor-specific IFN-γ expression in CD3+/CD8+ T cells, BM cells were plated in 96-
well plates (2 × 105 cells per well) in the presence of tumor cell lysate, nonspecific
control peptide, or medium alone. Cells were cultured for 72 h followed by incu-
bation with Golgi stop for 4 h. Cells were stained extracellularly with anti-CD3-
FITC and anti-CD8-APC antibodies, permeabilized, stained intracellularly with
anti-IFN-γ-PE or its corresponding isotype control, and then analyzed by flow
cytometry. All the antibodies were from BD Biosciences.
Bioluminescent imaging of primary and metastatic tumors. Tumor burden in
mice bearing MDA-MB-231-Luc was assessed by visualization of in vivo luciferase
activity using a Xenogen IVIS Spectrum system. Images were acquired at 10 min
post injection of 50 mg kg−1 i.p. dose of luciferin. To detect metastases, the lower
portion of each animal was shielded before re-imaging to minimize biolumines-
cence from the primary tumor. Lungs were harvested and imaged ex vivo to
confirm in vivo observations. Photon flux was used to quantify the differences in
tumor burden between treatment groups.
Immunoblot analysis. RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling) was used for cell lysis
according to manufacturer’s instructions and the protein concentrations were
determined by BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific). Proteins were separated by
Criterion SDS-PAGE using Bis-Tris 4–12% gradient polyacrylamide gels (BioRad)
and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes according to standard
protocols. The primary antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology: FOXP3
(Cat. 5298), phospho-SMAD2/3 (Cat. 3101), total SMAD2/3 (Cat. 3102), and β-
actin (Cat. 8457). Secondary antibodies were from GE Healthcare: anti-rabbit IgG
(NA914) and anti-mouse IgG (NA931). The uncropped scans are provided in
Supplementary Figures 3–5.
Human cell and tissue samples. Approval for research on human subjects was
obtained from The Johns Hopkins University Institutional Review Board. This
study qualified for exemption under the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services policy for protection of human subjects (45 CFR 46.101(b)) (IRB 03-11-
12-06e). BM, peripheral blood, and tumor samples were obtained from patients
and normal donors under informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki with approval from the Institutional Review Board at Johns Hopkins
University. Plasma was removed by centrifugation and stored at − 80 °C. Lym-
phocytes were obtained by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation (GE
Healthcare).
Animal use and care. The animals were maintained in accordance with guidelines
of the American Association of Laboratory Animal Care and a research protocol
approved by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Use and Care Committee.
Statistical analyses and interpretation. All data are presented as the mean ±
SEM. Student’s unpaired t-test (two-sided) was used to analyze differences between
two groups. When appropriate, the Bonferroni correction was applied to account
for multiple comparisons. Results with p < 0.05 were considered significant. Sta-
tistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad InStat (GraphPad Software). P-
values are summarized as: *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, and ***P ≤ 0.001, unless stated
otherwise.
Data availability. The TCGA data referenced in the study are available in a public
repository from the National Cancer Institute Cancer Genome Atlas website. All
the other data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article
