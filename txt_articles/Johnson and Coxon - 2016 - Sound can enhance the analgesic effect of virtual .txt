Virtual reality (VR) technology may serve as an effective non-
pharmacological analgesic to aid pain management. During VR
distraction, the individual is immersed in a game presented
through a head-mounted display (HMD). The technological
level of the HMD can vary, as can the use of different input
devices and the inclusion of sound. While more technologically
advanced designs may lead to more effective pain management
the specific roles of individual components within such
systems are not yet fully understood. Here, the role of
supplementary auditory information was explored owing to
its particular ecological relevance. Healthy adult participants
took part in a series of cold-pressor trials submerging their
hand in cold water for as long as possible. Individual pain
tolerances were measured according to the time (in seconds)
before the participant withdrew their hand. The concurrent
use of a VR game and the inclusion of sound was varied
systematically within participants. In keeping with previous
literature, the use of a VR game increased pain tolerance
across conditions. Highest pain tolerance was recorded when
participants were simultaneously exposed to both the VR
game and supplementary sound. The simultaneous inclusion
of sound may therefore play an important role when designing
VR to manage pain.
1. Background
Virtual reality (VR) technology can provide an effective non-
pharmacological means to reduce acute and traumatic injury pain
[1]. This technique typically requires participants to experience a
virtual digital environment through a combination of computer
peripherals. These may include a head-mounted display (HMD)
with head-tracking, headphones that provide sound and/or
noise reduction and handheld input devices (such as game
controllers). Participants make use of the technology to take part
in an immersive VR experience, usually an interactive game,

while experiencing some form of pain. Such system designs have been found to be effective in
minimizing the perception of the pain in a range of clinical contexts including: treatment and care of
burn victims [1,2]; paediatric cancer treatment [3,4] and dental pain [5,6]. These systems have also been
effective in laboratory tests with healthy adults [7–10]. However, the relative effectiveness of the design
depends upon the technological level of the system used [11].
Hoffman et al. [11] found that perceived pain was reduced to a greater extent in a ‘high technology’
group compared with a ‘low technology’ group. The system design differed in terms of: the field of view
of the HMD; graphical resolution; game interactivity; head-tracking and inclusion of sound. Efforts to
determine the influence of each individual component are ongoing. For example, Hoffman et al. [12]
found that an HMD with a larger field of view was more effective than one with a smaller field of view;
Dahlquist et al. [7] and Wender et al. [13] found that an interactive game was more effective than a non-
interactive game; Dahlquist et al. [9] found that changing the avatar point of view made no difference
for their sample, whereas Law et al. [14] have isolated the effect as an attentional one discrete from the
kinaesthetic aspects of controller use. An important aspect of the design which has yet to be directly
explored is the importance of including sound within such a system.
It is possible that sound may have an additive role (enhancing the overall analgesic effect for the
participant), that sound may be unnecessary (adding nothing to the analgesic effect) or that sound on
its own may be sufficient (providing an equivalent analgesic effect). On a theoretical level, it has been
suggested that the analgesic effect of VR may be due to competing demands for attentional resources
[11,15] in line with theoretical models of pain perception in which pain must be attended to in order
to be perceived [16]. This deleterious effect has been framed according to the multiple resource theory
of Wickens [17]. Within this theory, it is proposed that attentional resources may be distributed across
different sensory systems such that attentional demands on one sensory system may not necessarily
deplete the resources available for other sensory systems. It has been argued that highly engaging and
interactive VR designs should therefore provide greater distraction as they will deplete the attentional
resources across multiple sensory systems [7–9,14]. With the individual component of sound, it is
therefore viable that the inclusion of sound alongside a VR experience will demand additional attentional
resources that are otherwise not engaged, that this competition will limit the overall attentional resources
available for pain perception, and in turn enhance the analgesic effect. This assumption has yet to
be tested.
This assumption is particularly important on an ecological level. The ultimate aim of such research is
to be able to sensibly advise practitioners on the most effective designs for their VR systems. In practice,
many practitioners are unlikely to have the resources to be able to make use of large-scale and highly
immersive VR systems and are likely to be limited to affordable commercially available systems. Recent
developments have meant that the use of HMDs is becoming increasingly more affordable and relatively
low-cost headsets are soon to reach commercial markets. If an individual decides to make use of this
new low-cost technology, a simple decision a practitioner can make is whether to include sound as
part of the distraction technique through the addition of a pair of headphones. On a theoretical level,
we would assume that this should make a positive difference but as yet there is no direct empirical
evidence to support such a claim. Whether sound does make a difference is therefore a question of
ecological relevance.
Here, participants took part in a series of cold-pressor trials to measure pain tolerance. The inclusion
of sound was systematically manipulated alongside playing a VR game with an HMD such that
participants were exposed to: (i) no sound and no HMD (baseline); (ii) sound but no HMD; (iii) HMD but
no sound; and (iv) a combination of both the sound and the HMD. In line with theoretical accounts of
pain perception [16], it was expected that sound would have an additive effect, increasing pain tolerance
when included with the VR game. It was also expected that it would have an analgesic effect in its own
right separate from any influence of the VR game.
2. Methods
Thirty-two healthy adults were recruited from York St John University campus (23 females, nine
males) with a mean age of 20.28 years (s.d. = 2.00). Both written and verbal consent was obtained
prior to taking part in the study using procedures approved by the relevant research ethics committee
at York St John University. Participants were excluded from participating if they had a known
condition or health issue that may have interacted with the use of an HMD (e.g. existing feelings of
nausea).

2.1. Design
A within-participants design was used with each participant acting as their own control group.
Participants completed four cold-pressor trials under four different conditions: no HMD and no
sound (baseline); sound only; HMD only, and both HMD and sound. To control for order effects, all
participants provided the baseline measure first before completing the remaining three conditions in a
randomized order. Pain tolerance was measured as the total number of seconds the participant kept their
non-dominant hand submerged in the ice water during each condition.
2.2. Equipment
A demonstration version of Radial-G (Tammeka Games) was chosen as the VR game for this study.
Radial-G is an interactive futuristic racing game played from a first person perspective; a player is seated
in a space vehicle and races around a track alone (figure 1). Players cannot die in the game, and the game
does not end until it is manually stopped. The speed and direction of the virtual vehicle can be controlled
using the arrow buttons on a keyboard.
The HMD was an Oculus Rift DK2 with a resolution of 960 × 1080 pixels per eye, a 100° field of view
and a 75 Hz refresh rate. The HMD used low-persistence organic light-emitting diodes, and provided
both head-tracking and positional tracking. It is worth noting that the Oculus Rift is not a medical
device and has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The HMD was connected
to an Alienware 17 laptop with a fourth-gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4710MQ processor and NVIDIA(R)
GeForce(R) GTX880M graphics card. Noise cancelling headphones were manufactured by Sennheiser
(PXC, 250-II) and were used to play the game-corresponding music. The game music was the same for all
conditions where it was played. The noise cancelling function was turned on whenever the headphones
were worn.
A Fastime Zero 1 stopwatch was used, and both hand temperature and water temperature were
measured using a biofeedback probe manufactured by Electronic Temperature Instruments Ltd., with
a detectable temperature range between −19.9 and 69.9°C. The cold-pressor equipment consisted of
a container filled with cold water maintained at 1°C using cooler blocks and ice. The water was
maintained around 1°C to lower the possibility of ceiling effects but nevertheless provide an appropriate
pain stimulus [8]. The temperature was allowed to fluctuate between 1°C above or below the target
temperature. A bucket of warm water was used to reheat the participant’s hand once they had removed
it from the cold water. It is worth noting that additional measures of ‘presence’ were completed for the
two conditions making use of an HMD for exploratory reasons. The results of these are not reported
here as they apply only to two conditions, and the information is tangential to the specific aims of the
research.

2.3. Procedure
Participants were seated with their non-dominant hand next to the cold-pressor apparatus and in front
of the laptop, HMD and headphones. Before each condition, the participant’s hand temperature was
attained using the biofeedback probe. After hand temperature was attained, the probe was placed in the
cold-pressor to monitor the water temperature. Participants wore noise cancelling headphones across
all conditions.
A baseline measure of pain tolerance was taken first. Participants were asked to submerge their non-
dominant hand in the cold water and to hold it there for as long as possible. Time was recorded from
the point at which the participants hand was submerged up to the wrist and stopped when the hand
was removed. Immediately after the participant removed their hand, it was placed in warm water.
The temperature of the hand was then measured to ensure it had returned to the baseline temperature.
Single cold-pressor trials were then completed for the remaining three conditions in a randomized order.
The temperature of the warm water bath was monitored between trials and was constant.
In the sound only condition game, corresponding music was played through the headphones during
the trial, and no HMD was worn. The visual input in this condition was therefore identical to that in
the baseline. In the HMD only condition, the game was played during the trial wearing the HMD and
controlling the game using their dominant hand and the arrow keys on the laptop. In the sound and
HMD condition, both game-corresponding music and the game were played. Participants were given
the opportunity to practise playing the game using the HMD for 30 s before they began the relevant
trials. In line with previous research [7–9], a 4 min limit was imposed on participants submerging their
hand in the cold water for safety reasons. If participants had not removed their hand after 4 min, they
were instructed to do so.
3. Results
Times from five participants were removed from the analysis as the participants reached the 4 min
safety limit on one or more of the trials (three males and two females). Pain tolerance times for the
remaining participants (n = 27) were compared across the four conditions using a one-way ANOVA.
A log10 transformation of the data was used as the distributions of the raw scores were not normal
(descriptive statistics is provided in table 1). Skew and kurtosis levels between −1 and +1 were
considered as tolerable limits. A significant main effect of condition was found (F3,78 = 54.53, p < 0.05,
η2 = 0.68, post hoc power = 1.00) indicating that differences in pain tolerance between the conditions were
statistically significant. Post hoc pairwise comparisons with a Bonferroni adjustment indicated that mean
pain tolerances across all four conditions were statistically different from one another (p < 0.05). Scores
were lowest in the baseline condition followed by the sound only condition, and scores were higher in
the HMD only condition and highest in the sound and HMD condition.
4. Discussion and conclusion
In this study, we compared the relative effectiveness of playing a VR game, listening to sound and the
combination of the two on pain tolerance in cold-pressor trials. Participants demonstrated the predicted
behaviour with exposure to both a VR game and supplementary sound increasing pain tolerance to
a greater extent than the VR game in isolation or the sound in isolation. The results of the study are
consistent with the suggestion that the analgesic effect of VR is due to competition for attentional

resources [11,15]. The inclusion of sound alongside the VR game is likely to have been more attentionally
demanding than both aspects in isolation, thereby leading to less attentional resources that could be
allocated to the pain stimulus. This is consistent with the finding that sound on its own also increased
pain tolerance, but not to the same extent.
While previous research supports the broad notion that the higher the technological level of the VR
system the more effective it will be, this provides limited guidance on the necessary components of such
a system. As noted previously, evidence has indicated that the field of view in the HMD [12], and the
interactive nature of the game [7,13] may be important. The results reported here have added to this
literature through providing the first direct test of whether sound enhances the analgesic effect of VR
distraction techniques. In using VR to increase pain tolerance, it is therefore worthwhile including sound
within the design of the system wherever possible.
It is worth noting that aspects of the study may limit these conclusions. The participants sampled
were predominantly female, and the number of male participants is relatively low. An inspection of
the data provides no suggestion that the effects described are more apparent for women rather than
men. However, it is worth noting that further research may be needed to guarantee that these specific
effects are not more powerful for females than males. On a practical level, it is also worth noting that
the apparatus used for the cold-pressor did not include a circulator. The temperature of the water was
monitored to ensure that it was at a constant temperature, but the potential for fluctuations in water
temperature within the apparatus still remained. This should be borne in mind as minor changes in
temperature can influence pain tolerance [18], so these results should ideally be confirmed with the use
of a circulator also. Finally, the order of the experimental trials was randomized within participants to
control for potential order effects and habituation. The specific and predictable pattern of results despite
this randomization would indicate that these aspects were sufficiently controlled for. However, it is
important to note that the baseline measure was always taken first. While this is in line with comparable
work within the field [7–9], systematic counterbalancing that is inclusive of the baseline may be desirable
in future work. This would allow for greater confidence that differences from the baseline measure were
not due to other contributory factors related to the order of trials (e.g. habituation, anticipatory anxiety).
On a more conceptual level, future research should also focus upon the nature of the sound used
within the design. For example, it would be useful to determine which categories of sound provide
the most effective form of distraction from pain. Here, game-relevant music was played, but sounds
inconsistent with the game, or distinctive sounds, may instead demand more attentional resources. It
would be useful to determine if the sense of immersion provided by game-consistent sound is more or
less important than the potential of distinctive sounds to capture attention. It will also be important to
determine the limits of such an effect, and the potential contributions of realistic haptic and olfactory
stimulation. However, at the moment, a researcher or practitioner may find that their choices are more
limited to the use of an HMD and/or headphones when purchasing commercially available equipment.
To this end, this study clearly demonstrates the additional benefit of including sound within such
systems in addition to the stimulation provided through the HMD.
