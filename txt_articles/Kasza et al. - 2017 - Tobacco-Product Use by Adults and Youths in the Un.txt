Abstract
BACKGROUND—Noncigarette tobacco products are evolving rapidly, with increasing 
popularity in the United States.
METHODS—We present prevalence estimates for 12 types of tobacco products, using data from 
45,971 adult and youth participants (≥12 years of age) from Wave 1 (September 2013 through 
December 2014) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, a large, 
nationally representative, longitudinal study of tobacco use and health in the United States. 
Participants were asked about their use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, traditional cigars, cigarillos, 
filtered cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah, snus pouches, other smokeless tobacco, dissolvable tobacco, 
bidis, and kreteks. Estimates of the prevalence of use for each product were determined according 
to use category (e.g., current use or use in the previous 30 days) and demographic subgroup, and 
the prevalence of multiple-product use was explored.
RESULTS—More than a quarter (27.6%) of adults were current users of at least one type of 
tobacco product in 2013 and 2014, although the prevalence varied depending on use category. A 
total of 8.9% of youths had used a tobacco product in the previous 30 days; 1.6% of youths were

 daily users. Approximately 40% of tobacco users, adults and youths alike, used multiple tobacco 
products; cigarettes plus e-cigarettes was the most common combination. Young adults (18 to 24 
years of age), male adults and youths, members of racial minorities, and members of sexual 
minorities generally had higher use of tobacco than their counterparts.
CONCLUSIONS—During this study, 28% of U.S. adults were current users of tobacco, and 9% 
of youths had used tobacco in the previous 30 days. Use of multiple products was common among 
tobacco users. These findings will serve as baseline data to examine between-person differences 
and within-person changes over time in the use of tobacco products. (Funded by the National 
Institute on Drug Abuse and the Food and Drug Administration.)
Smoking is responsible for more U.S. deaths annually than the acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome, use of alcohol and illegal drugs, motor vehicle accidents, murders, and suicides 
combined.1 With recent data suggesting higher smoking-attributable mortality than 
previously estimated,2 the medical community is urged to make tobacco control a high 
priority.3 The prevalence of current use of cigarettes has declined during the past 50 years, 
from 42% of adults in 1965 to less than 20% in 2014,4,5 but disparities in cigarette smoking 
across demographic subgroups (particularly according to race or ethnic group, educational 
attainment, and socioeconomic status) have widened during the past several decades,5,6 and 
smoking prevalence remains exceptionally high among members of sexual minorities.5,7,8 
Furthermore, noncigarette tobacco products are rapidly evolving, and their effect on 
population-level health is unknown.9–11 Use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), cigars, 
smokeless tobacco, and hookah (waterpipe) has risen sharply in the past decade,12–15 and 
the use of two or more tobacco products has increased in recent years, especially among 
young adults.16–19
The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 gave the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) broad regulatory authority over the manufacture, marketing, and 
distribution of regulated tobacco products to protect the health of the U.S. population.20 The 
FDA Center for Tobacco Products uses a robust scientific evidence base to inform and assess 
the effect of its tobacco regulatory activities.21 In 2011, the Population Assessment of 
Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study was established to generate longitudinal epidemiologic 
data on tobacco-use behavior and health in the U.S. population.
In contrast to other national studies that have been used for the surveillance of tobacco 
use,22–27 the PATH Study uses a detailed assessment of tobacco-use behaviors, the inclusion 
of biomarkers, and a longitudinal design in a comprehensive effort to document tobacco use. 
Specifically, the design of the PATH Study will allow for examination of between-person 
differences and within-person changes over time in patterns of use of existing and emerging 
tobacco products, exposures and related biomarkers, risk perceptions, and health conditions 
potentially related to tobacco use.28 An additional feature of the PATH Study is the use of 
pictures to assist respondents in answering questions about their awareness and use of 
noncigarette tobacco products.29 Respondents in national surveys may not always clearly 
distinguish between types of tobacco products (e.g., filtered cigars vs. cigarettes, or snus 
pouches vs. other smokeless tobacco products), which could affect estimates of 
prevalence.12,30

 In this article, we present estimates of the prevalence of tobacco use among adults and 
youths, on the basis of Wave 1 (2013–2014) of the PATH Study, according to type of 
tobacco product and category of tobacco use. Three broad categories of tobacco-use 
behaviors were examined: the prevalence of use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, any type of cigar, 
traditional cigars, cigarillos, filtered cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah, smokeless tobacco 
(including and excluding snus pouches), snus pouches, dissolvable tobacco, bidis (small 
brown cigarettes wrapped in a leaf and typically tied on one or both ends with string; among 
youths), kreteks (clove cigarettes; among youths), and any tobacco product according to 
various categories of use; the prevalence of current use (among adults) or use in the previous 
30 days (among youths) for each type of tobacco product according to demographic 
subgroup; and the prevalence of multiple-product use (i.e., use of two or more tobacco 
products) and single-product use.
METHODS
Study Population
Wave 1 of the PATH Study included 45,971 adults and youths in the United States 12 years 
of age or older; data were collected from September 12, 2013, through December 15, 2014. 
This article reports national estimates from 32,320 adult participants (≥18 years of age) and 
13,651 youth participants (12 to 17 years of age). Parent interviews were also conducted 
with one parent of 13,589 of the youth participants (99.5%). The parent interview collected 
information about the youth that was deemed to be more reliable when obtained from a 
parent (e.g., certain health information), as well as contextual information about the 
household and the parent’s own use of tobacco. Adult and youth data were collected with the 
use of an audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI), available in English and Spanish.
Address-based, area-probability sampling was used for recruitment; an in-person household 
screener selected youths and adults. Adult tobacco users, young adults (18 to 24 years of 
age), and black persons were oversampled relative to population proportions. Up to 2 youths 
per household were sampled unless a household included multiple births, in which case 
additional youths could be selected. Weighting procedures adjusted for oversampling and 
nonresponse. The weights were further adjusted so that the sums of the weights matched 
independent population totals for standard demographic groups; these totals were based on 
U.S. Census Bureau data. (For details on youth sampling and weighting procedures, see the 
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.) Combined 
with the use of a probability sample, the weighted data allow estimates produced by the 
PATH Study to be representative of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. The 
weighted response rate for the household screener was 54.0%. Among screened households, 
the overall weighted response rate was 74.0% for the adult interview and 78.4% for the 
youth interview. A nonresponse bias analysis for Wave 1 can be found at http://doi.org/
10.3886/ICPSR36231.
The PATH Study implemented numerous procedures to protect respondents’ privacy and 
confidentiality, including obtaining written informed consent from adults and written assent 
from youths; requiring all staff to be certified in data security, confidentiality, and privacy 
issues and procedures; requiring staff to sign a pledge of confidentiality; storing and

 transmitting data with the use of advanced data encryption; and identifying survey data and 
biospecimens with the use of randomly assigned identification numbers and storing 
identifying information in separate, secure files. Further details regarding the PATH Study 
design and methods are reported by Hyland et al.29 The study was conducted by Westat, a 
contract research organization, and approved by its institutional review board.
Measures
Types of Tobacco Products—Participants were asked a series of questions about each 
of the following 12 types of tobacco products: cigarettes, e-cigarettes, traditional cigars, 
cigarillos, filtered cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah, snus pouches, other smokeless tobacco (i.e., 
loose snus, moist snuff, dip, spit, or chewing tobacco), dissolvable tobacco, bidis (youths 
only), and kreteks (youths only). Participants were given a brief description and shown 
pictures of each type of product (except cigarettes) before being asked about the product. 
The questionnaires and pictures are available for downloading.31
Categories of Tobacco Use—For each type of tobacco product, participants were asked 
a series of questions, including whether they had heard of the product (except cigarettes, for 
which universal awareness was assumed); whether they had ever used the product, even one 
or two puffs or one or two times; whether they had used the product during the previous 30 
days; on how many of the previous 30 days they had used the product; and how much of 
each type of product they had used in their lifetimes. Adult participants were also asked 
whether they had ever used the product “fairly regularly” and whether they now use the 
product every day, some days, or not at all (non-daily users of hookah were also asked their 
frequency of use). Adults who had ever used a product but now use it “not at all” were asked 
how long it had been since they quit using it (responses were given in days, months, or 
years).
Various categories of tobacco use were assessed for each type of tobacco product. Current 
use indicates that the participant now smokes or uses the product every day or some days 
(for each tobacco product other than hookah; for hookah, current use indicates that the 
participant now uses the product every day, some days, usually weekly, or usually monthly). 
Current regular use indicates that the participant has ever smoked or used the product “fairly 
regularly” and now smokes or uses the product every day or some days (for each tobacco 
product other than cigarettes and hookah; for cigarettes, current regular use indicates that the 
participant has smoked ≥100 cigarettes in his or her lifetime and now smokes every day or 
some days; for hookah, current regular use indicates that the participant has ever used the 
product “fairly regularly” and now uses the product every day, some days, usually weekly, or 
usually monthly). Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix presents additional categories of 
tobacco use that were assessed for each type of tobacco product. In addition, for each use 
category, use of any cigar was defined as use of at least one type of cigar (traditional cigars, 
cigarillos, or filtered cigars), use of smokeless tobacco including snus pouches was defined 
as use of either product, and use of any tobacco was defined as use of at least one of the 10 
(adults) or 12 (youths) types of tobacco products. An exception to the definition of “any 
tobacco use” was current use of tobacco among adults, which was determined on the basis of 
current regular use in the case of cigarettes and current use in the case of every other tobacco

 product. Defining nonuse of any cigars, smokeless tobacco including snus pouches, and any 
tobacco required complete data on all types of the respective tobacco products assessed.
Multiple-Product and Single-Product Use—Among adults, multiple-product and 
single-product use was determined according to the “current regular use” definition for 
cigarettes and the “current use” definition for each other type of tobacco product. Among 
youths, multiple-product and single-product use was determined according to the “use in the 
previous 30 days” definition for each type of tobacco product. Complete data for all tobacco 
products were required to define multiple-product and single-product use. Single-product 
use was defined by the use of only one type of product (e.g., cigarettes only or e-cigarettes 
only), whereas multiple-product use was defined by the use of two or more types of products 
(e.g., both cigarettes and e-cigarettes). All combinations of multiple-product use were 
determined.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were conducted with the use of Stata 12 software.32 Prevalence estimates were 
weighted to represent the U.S. adult and youth populations. Variances were estimated with 
the method of balanced, repeated replications,33 with Fay’s adjustment set to 0.3 to increase 
the stability of estimates.34 The logit-transformation method was used to calculate 
confidence intervals. The tables show 95% confidence intervals for point estimates.
The prevalences of product awareness and use of each product type, use of any cigar, use of 
smokeless tobacco including snus pouches, and use of any tobacco were computed 
according to the use categories shown in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix as they 
pertained to adults and youths, stratified according to age group (12 to 14 years, 15 to 17 
years, 18 to 24 years, or ≥25 years). Among adults, the prevalence of current regular use 
(cigarettes) or current use (other tobacco products) was also stratified according to sex, age, 
race or ethnic group, sexual orientation, educational attainment, total annual household 
income, and U.S. Census region. Among youths, the prevalences of ever use and use in the 
previous 30 days were also stratified according to sex, age, race or ethnic group, sexual 
orientation (asked of those ≥14 years of age), educational level, and U.S. Census region.
The prevalences of overall and product-specific single-product use and multiple-product use 
were determined in the entire adult study population, in the entire youth study population, 
among adult tobacco users, and among youth tobacco users. Among adult multiple-product 
users and separately among youth multiple-product users, all combinations of tobacco 
products used were determined, and each combination that accounted for at least 1% of 
multiple-product users is presented.
RESULTS
Weighting
The weights were adjusted so that the sums of the weights for various demographic groups 
matched national population totals. Therefore, weighted distributions of the sample (Table 1, 
and Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix) were very close to the population 
distributions.

 Tobacco Use According to Product Type and Use Category
Adults—Among adults, current use of cigarettes was most prevalent, followed by use of 
cigars, e-cigarettes, hookah, and smokeless tobacco (Table 2). The prevalence of use varied 
according to the use category, particularly for noncigarette tobacco products (Tables S3 
through S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). For example, for cigars, the prevalence of 
current use was 7.8%, whereas the prevalence of current regular use was 3.2%. Similarly, for 
e-cigarettes, the prevalence of use in the previous 30 days was 6.7%, whereas the prevalence 
of current regular use was 2.4%. Similar variations were observed for hookah use: the 
prevalence of current use was 4.2%, whereas the prevalence of current regular use was 1.4%. 
(For more on current regular use, see Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix.) For most 
tobacco products and most use categories, the prevalence of use was higher among those 18 
to 24 years of age than among those 25 years of age or older (Table 2, and Tables S3 through 
S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Two thirds of adults had ever smoked cigarettes; 20.1% of adults were former regular users, 
and 25.3% were former nonregular users (Tables S3 and S6 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The majority of adults had never used other types of tobacco products. Although 
the prevalence of former regular use was less than 5% for each type of noncigarette tobacco 
product, the prevalence of former nonregular use ranged from 0.4% (dissolvable tobacco) to 
34.1% (cigars).
Youths—The majority of youths were aware of e-cigarettes, pipe tobacco, smokeless 
tobacco, any cigars, and hookah, whereas less than 10% were aware of dissolvable tobacco, 
kreteks, and bidis (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). In general, youths 15 to 17 
years of age were more likely to be aware of tobacco products than those 12 to 14 years of 
age. Overall, 21.8% of youths had ever used tobacco, 13.4% had ever used cigarettes, 10.7% 
had ever used e-cigarettes, 7.5% had ever used cigars (with use of cigarillos being most 
prevalent at 6.5%), 7.5% had ever used hookah, and 4.8% had ever used smokeless tobacco 
including snus pouches (Table 2). The prevalence of ever use of these products was higher 
among those 15 to 17 years of age than among those 12 to 14 years of age. The overall 
prevalence of tobacco use in the previous 30 days among youths was 8.9%, with prevalences 
of 4.6% for cigarette use, 3.1% for e-cigarette use, 2.5% for cigar use (with cigarillo use 
being most prevalent at 2.2%), 1.7% for hookah use, and 1.6% for use of smokeless tobacco 
including snus pouches. As with ever use, use in the previous 30 days was higher among 
those 15 to 17 years of age than among those 12 to 14 years of age. Daily use was less than 
2% for any tobacco product and followed a pattern that was similar to that for use in the 
previous 30 days. Cigarettes were the most common product used among daily users.
Tobacco Use According to Product Type and Demographic Subgroup
Adults—Men were more likely than women to use any tobacco product (34.8% vs. 20.8%) 
and to use each type of tobacco product other than dissolvable tobacco. Use of any tobacco 
product also differed according to race or ethnic group, sexual orientation, educational level, 
income, and region, such that prevalence was higher among non-Hispanic American Indians 
or Alaska Natives, non-Hispanics of two or more races, and non-Hispanic blacks than 
among non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Asians, Native Ha-waiians, or

 other Pacific Islanders; higher among those who identified as bisexual, gay, or lesbian than 
among those who identified as heterosexual; higher among those with less education and 
lower incomes than among their counterparts; and higher among those living in the South or 
Midwest than among those living in the Northeast or West. (For detailed data on current 
tobacco use among adults according to product type and demographic subgroup, see Tables 
S7 through S12 in the Supplementary Appendix.)
Youths—In general, the use of tobacco products according to demographic subgroup 
followed similar patterns for the categories of ever use and use in the previous 30 days. 
There was a consistent pattern of higher prevalence of tobacco use with increasing age and 
grade in school. In general, male youths were more likely than female youths to use tobacco, 
although for many products, differences in prevalence were small. Ever use of tobacco was 
highest among those who were non-Hispanic of two or more races and lowest among those 
who were non-Hispanic Asian. Tobacco use was higher among youths who identified as 
bisexual, gay, or lesbian than among those who identified as heterosexual. In general, 
prevalence was similar across geographic regions. (For detailed data on ever use and use in 
the previous 30 days among youths according to product type and demographic subgroup, 
see Tables S13 through S22 in the Supplementary Appendix.)
Prevalence of Multiple-Product and Single-Product Use
Adults—Among adult tobacco users, the prevalence of multiple-product use was 37.8%, 
with 76.2% of multiple-product users using cigarettes and at least one other product (Table 
S23 in the Supplementary Appendix). There were 331 different combinations of products 
used among adult multiple-product users, with the most common combination being 
cigarettes plus e-cigarettes (22.5%). Figure 1 shows each combination of multiple-product 
use that accounted for at least 1% of adult multiple-product users; together these 20 
combinations accounted for 66.2% of all adult multiple-product users. Among adults who 
used tobacco, 62.2% used one product, 22.5% used two products, and 15.3% used three or 
more products (not shown in figure). Among adult single-product users, more than 60% used 
cigarettes, and less than 10% used each of the other types of tobacco product (Table S23 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Youths—Among youths who had used tobacco in the previous 30 days, the prevalence of 
multiple-product use was 43.0% (Table S24 in the Supplementary Appendix). Among youth 
multiple-product users, most used cigarettes (71.4%) and about half used e-cigarettes or 
cigarillos (53.7% and 46.0%, respectively). Figure 2 shows the 10 combinations of multiple 
products for which robust prevalence estimates could be determined. Together, these 10 
combinations accounted for 54.5% of multiple-product users. The most common 
combinations of products used were cigarettes plus e-cigarettes (accounting for 15.1% of 
multiple-product users) and cigarettes plus cigarillos (accounting for 10.1%). Among youths 
who used tobacco, 57.0% used one product, 23.7% used two products, and 19.3% used three 
or more products (not shown in figure). Among youth single-product users, approximately 
40% used cigarettes, 24% used e-cigarettes, 15% used hookah, and less than 10% used 
cigarillos or smokeless tobacco (Table S24 in the Supplementary Appendix).

 DISCUSSION
Initial (Wave 1) findings from the PATH Study, a nationally representative, longitudinal 
study of tobacco use and health in the United States, indicate that more than one quarter of 
adults 25 years of age or older and nearly 38% of young adults (18 to 24 years of age) were 
current users of a tobacco product in 2013 and 2014. A total of 15% of youths 15 to 17 years 
of age and nearly 3% of youths 12 to 14 years of age had used at least one type of tobacco 
product in the previous 30 days. Although cigarette use was the most prevalent in each age 
group, approximately 40% of tobacco users used at least two types of products, with 
cigarettes plus e-cigarettes being the most common combination of products used by adults 
and by youths.
Several other findings advance the literature and warrant longitudinal assessment of this 
cohort. The PATH Study enabled the comparison of prevalence estimates for tobacco use 
across different tobacco products on the basis of varying categories of current and previous 
use. Findings showed marked differences in identification of tobacco users on the basis of 
differing categories assessed. For example, the prevalence of e-cigarette use among adults 
was cut approximately in half when the measure of current use was restricted to those who 
had ever used e-cigarettes “fairly regularly.” Similar findings emerged for hookah use and 
cigar use.
Findings also showed substantial differences in tobacco use according to demographic 
characteristics. Among adults, tobacco use was generally higher among younger adults, 
men, members of racial minorities, members of sexual minorities, those with lower 
educational attainment and lower household income, and those living in the South or 
Midwest than among their counterparts. Among youths, the prevalences of ever use and use 
in the previous 30 days were higher among older youths, male youths, and members of 
sexual minorities than among their counterparts. Although these findings are generally 
consistent with those from other studies,4,8,12,16,35–37 the PATH Study data extend these 
prevalence estimates for a wide array of tobacco products.
Although the PATH Study was designed as a cohort study rather than a national surveillance 
survey, it nonetheless produced baseline estimates of tobacco-use prevalence that are 
consistent with similarly defined estimates from national surveys. For instance, estimates of 
adult cigarette smoking and use of smokeless tobacco were similar in the PATH Study, the 
2014 household-based National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH),24 and the 2013–
2014 telephone-based National Adult Tobacco Survey (NATS)4 (Table S25 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Some differences in estimates of e-cigarette use and cigar use 
were observed across these studies (e.g., the prevalence of current use of e-cigarettes was 
3.3% in NATS vs. 5.5% in the PATH Study, and the prevalence of cigar use in the previous 
30 days was 4.8% in NSDUH vs. 7.2% in the PATH Study). However, these differences 
probably result from differences in the way questions were asked and some categories were 
defined. Cigars, for example, are a heterogeneous class of products: only the PATH Study 
used pictures of products to help respondents recognize cigar types. In addition, question-
response options and lifetime thresholds of use of cigars and e-cigarettes differed across 
studies, which could further account for observed differences.

 Estimates of tobacco-use prevalence among youths from the household-based PATH Study 
were generally lower than those from school-based national surveys of youths, such as the 
National Youth Tobacco Survey27 and the Monitoring the Future study,26 and were similar to 
estimates from the 2014 household-based NSDUH24 (Table S26 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). These findings are consistent with previous literature citing mode of survey 
administration as a factor accounting for differences in estimates of tobacco-use prevalence 
in national surveys of youths.38,39 Reasons for differences in estimates owing to survey 
mode are unclear. Surveys administered in a school-based environment may overestimate 
tobacco-use behaviors because of peer influences, whereas youths may underreport tobacco-
use behaviors in a home-based survey out of fear that their parents will overhear answers or 
learn about them from the interviewer.39,40 Implementation of the PATH Study ACASI 
instrumentation was intended to reduce this bias through the actual and perceived privacy 
afforded by having the youths self-administer the questionnaire silently using headphones 
and a touchscreen to hear or read the questions and record the answers.
Beyond differences in survey mode, the PATH Study youth sample did not include those 18 
years of age, whereas the school-based surveys include 18-year-olds, and the data collection 
periods varied somewhat among surveys. Differences in the mode and timing of the surveys 
and the age structure of respondents probably contributed to differences in prevalence 
estimates and the rank-order of products between the PATH Study and the national surveys.
Although the findings reported here document the prevalence of tobacco use at the time of 
the first wave of the PATH Study, longitudinal data from future waves will help answer 
questions about transitions among multiple-product use, single-product use, nonuse of 
tobacco, and former tobacco use and, in particular, will help determine whether the direction 
of such transitions favors one type of product or another.
In conclusion, data from Wave 1 of the PATH Study indicate that more than a quarter of 
adults 18 years of age or older were current users of at least one type of tobacco product in 
2013 and 2014 and nearly 1 in 10 youths 12 to 17 years of age used a tobacco product in the 
previous 30 days, with cigarette use being most prevalent. Multiple-product use was 
common among tobacco users, with cigarettes plus e-cigarettes being the most common 
combination of tobacco products used. These foundational estimates of prevalence will serve 
as a baseline for this longitudinal cohort to address critical research questions such as those 
related to changes in the use of tobacco products, among existing users as well as those not 
currently using tobacco products. These data will help inform tobacco regulatory and control 
efforts aimed at protecting the health of the U.S. population.

 Figure 1. Most Common Combinations of Tobacco Products among Adult Multiple-Product 
Users
Prevalences are based on data from 6238 adults who reported current use of two or more 
types of tobacco products (data were collected from September 12, 2013, through December 
15, 2014). Percentages were weighted to the U.S. adult population. Current use was 
determined according to “current regular use” for cigarettes (the participant has smoked 
≥100 cigarettes in his or her lifetime and currently smokes every day or some days) and 
according to “current use” for each other type of tobacco product. Complete tobacco-use 
data about every product were needed to determine multiple-product use.

*Data were collected from September 12, 2013, through December 15, 2014. Black persons and young adults were oversampled; percentages were 
weighted to represent the U.S. adult and youth populations. The numbers of adult participants with missing data were 29 for sex, 559 for race or 
ethnic group, 769 for sexual orientation, 208 for education, and 3155 for household income. The numbers of youth participants with missing data 
were 39 for sex, 261 for race or ethnic group, 305 for education, and 135 for sexual orientation. Except for those with missing data for household 
income, participants with missing data were not included in the calculation of the weighted percentages. GED denotes general equivalency 
diploma.
†Eleven participants could be classified only as being 18 years of age or older. Two participants could be classified only as being 12 to 17 years of 
age.
‡Race and ethnic group were self-reported.
§Data are shown for respondents 14 years of age or older.
¶Weighted percentages include 265 participants who were enrolled in college, enrolled in vocational or technical school, not enrolled in school, 
attending home school, or attending an ungraded school (weighted percentage, 2.0).

*Data were collected from September 12, 2013, through December 15, 2014. The columns in the table are not mutually exclusive; participants who used one product may also have used another product. Percentages were weighted to the U.S. adult and youth populations, and 
confidence intervals were estimated with the method of balanced, repeated replications. Complete data about every type of tobacco product were required to define nonuse of any tobacco; similarly, complete data about every type of cigar were required to define nonuse of any 
cigar, and complete data about smokeless tobacco and snus pouches were required to define nonuse of smokeless tobacco including snus pouches. For the descriptions of the types of tobacco products that were provided to participants, see the Supplementary Appendix.
†Excluded were those who reported using cigars as blunts (i.e., cigars that have tobacco removed and replaced with marijuana) and did not identify as cigar users.
‡Data are for smokeless tobacco including snus pouches.
§Data are for participants who had ever used the product, even one or two puffs (cigarettes) or one or two times (other products).
¶The estimate was suppressed owing to a relative standard error greater than 30%.
||Data are for participants who had smoked or used the product (even one or two times) in the previous 30 days.
**For each tobacco product other than cigarettes and hookah, current use indicates that the participant now smokes or uses the product every day or some days. For cigarettes, the “current regular use” category was used, which indicates that the participant has smoked at least 100 
cigarettes in his or her lifetime and now smokes every day or some days. For hookah, current use indicates that the participant now uses the product every day, some days, usually weekly, or usually monthly.
††Daily use indicates that the participant now smokes or uses the product every day. Daily use of any tobacco, any cigar, and smokeless tobacco including snus pouches reflects only those who used at least one of the products that make up the combination group every day.
