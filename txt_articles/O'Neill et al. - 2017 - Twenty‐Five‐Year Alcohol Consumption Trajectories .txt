 Twenty-Five-Year Alcohol Consumption Trajectories and Their
Association With Arterial Aging: A Prospective Cohort Study
Darragh O’Neill, PhD; Annie Britton, PhD; Eric J. Brunner, PhD; Steven Bell, PhD
Background-—Emerging evidence suggests that arterial stiffness, an important marker of cardiovascular health, is associated with
alcohol consumption. However, the role of longer-term consumption patterns in the progression of arterial stiffness over time
remains unclear. A longitudinal cohort design was used to evaluate the association between alcohol consumption over 25 years
and subsequent changes in arterial stiffness.
Methods and Results-—Data (N=3869; 73% male) were drawn from the Whitehall II cohort study of British civil servants, in which
participants completed repeat pulse wave velocity assessments of arterial stiffness across a 4- to 5-year interval. Repeated alcohol
intake measurements were used to categorize participants into alcohol consumer types, accounting for longitudinal variability in
consumption. Sex-stratified linear mixed-effects modeling was used to investigate whether drinker types differed in their
relationship to pulse wave velocity and its progression over time. Males with consistent long-term heavy intake >112 g of ethanol/
week had significantly higher baseline pulse wave velocity (b=0.26 m/s; P=0.045) than those who drank consistently moderately
(1–112 g of ethanol/week). Male former drinkers showed significantly greater increases in arterial stiffness longitudinally
compared to consistently moderate drinkers (b=0.11 m/s; P=0.009). All associations were nonsignificant for females after
adjustment for body mass index, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, diabetes mellitus, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides.
Conclusions-—This work demonstrates that consistently heavy alcohol consumption is associated with higher cardiovascular risk,
especially among males, and also provides new insights into the potential impact of changes in drinking levels over time. It discusses
the additional insights possible when capturing longitudinal consumption patterns in lieu of reliance on recent intake alone.

Research has suggested that moderate levels of alcohol
consumption are associated with lower risk of cardiovascular
disease onset.2 The mechanisms underlying this association
are not fully understood nor the impact of changes in drinking
levels over time. There is a need to further examine how
alcohol consumption can impact on cardiovascular function-
ing and risk.
Arterial stiffness, which occurs where the vessel wall lacks
elasticity, is 1 indicator of cardiovascular health that may be
directly affected by alcohol consumption. This stiffness alters
arterial responsiveness to pressure variations and is indicative
of both functionally and structurally adverse changes.3 It is
independently linked to both cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality, which has been attributed to the impact that arterial
stiffness has on hemodynamic processes within the vascula-
ture.4,5 The importance of arterial stiffness to cardiac health has
led to proposals that it can be used as a surrogate endpoint for
studies of cardiovascular disease.6 It can be assessed accu-
rately and noninvasively using pulse wave velocity (PWV)
estimation.7 Arterial waveforms travel faster in less-elastic
vessels, so PWV values are inversely related to such elasticity.8
Research into alcohol consumption and PWV9–12 suggests
that their association reflects the same U-/J-shaped relation-
ship observed elsewhere in cardiovascular-focused studies of
alcohol, implying that moderate alcohol intake may have a
protective effect on arterial stiffness.13 This pattern has been
reflected in cross-sectional studies of specific population
subgroups, such as diabetics and different age groups.12–14

 Multiple mechanisms underlying this association have been
proposed, including alcohol-induced increases in high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as decreases in platelet
adhesiveness to the endothelium.15 Conversely, the greater
stiffness associated with high consumption may be attributed
to an alcohol-related increase in metalloproteinase activity.16
Studies examining associations between alcohol and
arterial stiffness have predominantly relied on cross-sectional
data, yet such designs mask longitudinal variability in
consumption levels and
hinder
comparisons
of
former
drinkers to nondrinkers.2,17 Moreover, it has been suggested
that short- and long-term consumption may have divergent
effects on PWV.18 New insights could therefore be garnered
by investigating longer-term patterns of alcohol intake that
properly capture the impact that variable intake levels and
discontinuation of drinking may have on arterial stiffness.
Capturing longitudinal measurements of PWV also would help
evaluate alcohol’s association with progression in arterial
stiffness and thus with arterial aging more generally.4
Twoearlier cohortstudieshaveshownthatdailyconsumption
of ≥23 g of ethanol is associated with increased incidence of
arterial stiffness over a 9-year period.19,20 A more-recent study
found that consuming alcohol twice-weekly or more is associ-
ated with significant PWV increases across a 5-year interval.21
These 3 studies comprised male participants only and relied on a
single cross-sectional assessment of alcohol consumption. To
our knowledge, only 1 study of the association between alcohol
and changes in PWV has used repeat assessments of alcohol
consumption.22 This study found that moderate drinkers with
normal blood pressure had significantly smaller increases in
PWVover 6 yearsthandid nondrinkers. Heavydrinkers withhigh
blood pressure had significantly greater increases in PWV than
their nondrinker or moderate drinker counterparts. The study,
however, did not assess whether longitudinal changes in
consumption patterns influence these associations.
Using repeat alcohol assessments covering more than 2
decades, we aim, in the current study, to more accurately
capture complexity in how drinking behaviors are associated
with arterial stiffness than has been previously achieved. The
primary aims of this study are to examine whether long-term
patterns of alcohol consumption are independently associated
with a baseline assessment of PWV and with longitudinal
change in PWV. Secondary aims include an examination of
whether short-term intake levels show comparable associa-
tions with PWV.
Methods
Sample and Design
The data have been sourced from the Whitehall II cohort
study. This study incorporates longitudinal assessments of
10 308 UK civil servants, originally recruited between 1985
and 1988. These recruits comprised 6895 males (67%) and
3413 females, with an overall age range of 34 to 56 years.
Arterial stiffness is deemed a surrogate endpoint for cardio-
vascular disease, as outlined in the introduction in the main
article. Consequently, participants with a previous history of
cardiovascular disease were excluded from the analytic
sample, leading to the exclusion of 897 participants. Clinical
assessments were repeated at 4- to 5-year intervals. PWV
measurement was introduced to the clinical protocol at phase
9, with assessments taking place in 2007–2009. Three
thousand eight hundred sixty-nine participants had a baseline
PWV assessment during this time. Follow-up testing took
place at phase 11, during 2012 and 2013. Of the participants
who underwent a PWV assessment at phase 9, 3130 also had
a successful PWV assessment at phase 11. The participant
selection process is illustrated in Figure 1.
Approval for the Whitehall II study was received from the
University College London Medical School Committee on the
ethics of human research, and participants gave written
informed consent. Whitehall II data are available to bona-fide
researchers for research purposes. The Whitehall II data-
sharing policy is available at http://www.ucl.ac.uk/whiteha
llII/data-sharing.
Measures
Outcome
The outcome of interest is carotid-femoral PWV, measured in
meters per second (m/s). Research has shown that carotid-
femoral PWV offers a more-sensitive arterial stiffness mea-
surement than PWV evaluation at other sites,23 and it has
been
described
as
the
“gold-standard”
assessment
approach.2 Higher PWV values are indicative of increased
arterial stiffness.
PWV was assessed using applanation tonometry (Sphyg-
moCor device; Atcor Medical, Sydney, Australia). Path length
was ascertained using both the carotid-sternal notch distance
and femoral-sternal notch distance. Participants underwent
up to 3 PWV measurements at each phase to ensure
assessment accuracy, and the mean of these was taken as
their PWV measurement for that phase.
Exposure
Self-reported alcohol consumption was assessed at phases 1,
3, 5, 7, and 9. Participants reported the number of glasses of
wine, pints of beer/cider, and measures of spirit/liqueur
consumed in the week preceding each assessment. These
values were then converted into ethanol volumes. In terms of
conversion ratios, 8 g of ethanol was assumed for each
measure of spirit and 16 g for each pint of beer/cider.24 The

 ethanol content of wine was estimated in line with recent
guidance regarding the increased alcohol content in a
standard wine glass since 1995.25,26 Each wine glass
consumed pre-1995 was assumed to contain 8 g of ethanol
and 16 g after this date.
Weekly consumption levels for all beverage types com-
bined were then used to categorize intake according to the
current UK guidelines.27 These define moderate consumption
for males and females as weekly ethanol intake volumes up to
112 g (≤14 UK units).
Utilizing these self-reported weekly ethanol intake data,
participants’ pattern of long-term alcohol consumption across
phases 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 was then derived. Definitions and
counts for this long-term intake categorization are presented
in Table 1. Unstable drinker types were labeled according to
their modal intake level. Further refinement in the catego-
rization of drinker types was limited by statistical power.
Where participants were missing consumption data in more
than 3 phases, long-term drinker type could not be reliably
determined and, accordingly, long-term drinker type was
deemed missing for 47 participants. Recent consumption
patterns, based on reported intake at phase 9 only, were also
evaluated as part of supplementary analyses. This alternative
categorization and associated counts are again described in
Table 1. Recent intake data were missing for 78 participants.
Covariates
To account for potential confounds, known demographic and
clinical risk factors for arterial stiffness were selected for
inclusion in the modeling. The covariates comprised standard
demographic characteristics, including age,28 sex,29 and
ethnicity.30 Socioeconomic position was also included31 and
categorized as low, medium, or high according to participants’
most recent employment grading. Smoking status was
assessed,32 with participants categorized as current, former,
or nonsmokers. Exercise level was likewise measured.33 This
was established by determining whether participants’ self-
reported activity level met or exceeded 2.5 hours of moder-
ate-to-vigorous activity per week, the World Health Organiza-
tion’s (WHO) recommended amount. Clinical
covariates
included body mass index34 and type II diabetes mellitus as
determined through the HbA1c blood glucose test.28 Mean
arterial pressure35 was determined using both diastolic and
systolic pressures at the time of the PWV assessment. Heart
rate,36 high-density lipoprotein cholesterol,37 and triglyceride
levels38 were also measured. Finally, to account for variability
in time between the PWV baseline and follow-up assessments,
the time difference was calculated for each participant and
standardized to a 4-year period (because of the mean interval
being 4.1 years). The covariates were assessed at the
baseline PWV assessment (phase 9, 2007–2009), and mean
centering was performed before modeling for those measured
on a continuous scale.
Statistical Analysis
To account for the existing cross-sectional evidence that sex
may moderate the alcohol-PWV relationship, the analyses in
the current study were stratified by participant sex.13,39
Linear mixed-effects modeling was then used to examine the
effect of alcohol drinker type on PWV and longitudinal
changes in this marker. A series of random intercept models
were developed using maximum likelihood estimation,40 with
long-term drinker type as the exposure in the first instance. A
second set of models was generated with the recent drinker
type
as
exposure.

 (standardized to 4 years) was used as the time indicator in all
models. The statistical analyses were performed in R (v3.3.0;
R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). For
both the long-term and recent intake exposures, models were
developed iteratively with increasing numbers of covariates
included, beginning with age, sex, and assessment interval,
followed by demographic and lifestyle factors (ethnicity,
smoking, socioeconomic position, and exercise level) and
ending with clinical factors (body mass index, type II diabetes
mellitus, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol). The reference category for long-term
consumption was stable moderate drinkers and for the recent
intake analysis was moderate intake.41
To address missing data, multiple imputation by chained
equations was undertaken using the R “mice” package (v2.25; R
Foundation for Statistical Computing), with 100 imputations
performed for both the male-only and female-only data subsets.
The outcome variable was included in the imputation model, but
not itself imputed; auxiliary variables were also utilized to
improve precision and adherence to the missing at random
assumption. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to examine
whether complete case analyses produced comparable results.
All tests of statistical significance were 2-tailed, and a
threshold of P<0.05 was used for inferring significance.
Results
Of the total 3869 participants in the analysis sample, 73.7%
were male. As shown in Table 1, the male sample had a much
higher proportion of heavy drinkers (stable, 17.7%; unstable,
27.9%) than did the female sample. Conversely, there were
over twice as many stable nondrinkers (8.2%) and former
drinkers (18.7%) in the female cohort as in the male. Unstable
moderate drinkers were the most common type among
females (32.2%) and were also prevalent among the male
sample (27.9%). Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics
of the male and female cohorts are provided in Tables 2 and
3, respectively, with additional stratification by long-term
drinking categorization.
The majority of the male (94.3%) and female (88.5%)
participants were of a white ethnicity. The most common
socioeconomic position among females was medium (48.7%)
and among males was high (57%). Few among either sex were
current smokers, whereas the majority (male, 68%; female,
74.1%) failed to meet the WHO’s recommended weekly
exercise levels. Among both cohorts, 1 in 10 had type II
diabetes mellitus.
Stable nondrinkers, regardless of sex, were the most likely
to have never smoked (male, 68.2%; female, 75.4%), whereas
stable heavy drinkers had the highest proportion of current
smokers (male, 8.8%; female, 7.3%). Former drinkers (male,
75.5%; female, 81.4%) were most likely to get insufficient
exercise. For both sexes, diabetes mellitus was most common
among nondrinkers.
The mean PWV at baseline for males was 8.5 m/s
(SD=2.0), which significantly increased to 9.1 m/s (SD=2.4)
by the follow-up (t(2349)=19.5; P<0.001). The female mean
was consistently lower, progressing from 8.2 m/s (SD=1.9)
at baseline to 8.7 m/s (SD=2.3) by the follow-up, also a
significant increase (t(779)=10.9; P<0.001).

long-term drinker types and for each modeling stage, with the

 adjusting for age and assessment interval, consistently heavy
drinkers had significantly higher baseline PWV values than the
stable moderate drinking reference group (male, b=0.35 m/s;
95% CI=0.08–0.62; P=0.012; female, b=0.66 m/s; 95%
CI=0.01–1.32; P=0.048). Female participants with an unsta-
ble pattern of moderate consumption (b=0.46 m/s; 95%
CI=0.10–0.82; P=0.012) also had higher PWV than those who
consistently drank moderately.
Following adjustment for additional demographic, lifestyle,
and clinical factors, the PWV of male stable heavy drinkers
remained significantly higher at baseline (b=0.26 m/s; 95%
CI=0.01–0.52; P=0.045). With the female participants, how-
ever, the associations for the stable heavy (b=0.42 m/s; 95%
CI=�0.18 to 1.02; P=0.169) and unstable moderate con-
sumers (b=0.28 m/s; 95% CI=�0.05 to 0.61; P=0.091) were
no

statistically
significant,
although
their
effect
estimates remained larger than that observed with the male
stable heavy drinkers.
These models also enabled the evaluation of differences
between the long-term drinker types in terms of the
subsequent change in PWV. Among males, regardless of
covariates included in the model, former drinkers showed
significantly greater increases in PWV over time relative to
stable
moderate
drinkers
(maximally
adjusted
model,
b=0.11 m/s; 95% CI=0.03–0.19; P=0.009). Interestingly,
these former drinkers had shown a large drop in association
with baseline PWV following adjustment for lifestyle and
clinical characteristics, yet these covariate adjustments had
no impact on the magnitude of the longitudinal association
observed in this group or any of the long-term drinker types.
With the female participants, no significant longitudinal
effects were found, the largest effect estimate in the
maximally adjusted model being for the stable nondrinkers
(b=0.08 m/s; 95% CI=�0.04 to 0.20; P=0.188).
The predicted mean PWV trajectories, following maximal
risk-adjustment, are illustrated in Figures 2 and 3 for male
and female participants, respectively. Figure 2 shows that
among males, stable moderate drinkers have the lowest PWV
values throughout the study period. Stable nondrinkers begin
the study period as being the male drinker type with the
highest PWV, but the plot illustrates that it is former drinkers
who subsequently show the most accelerated increase in
PWV among males over the follow-up period. Figure 3 shows
that stable heavy drinkers have the highest PWV at baseline
among the female drinker types, but that it is stable
nondrinkers who subsequently show the largest longitudinal
change in PWV, albeit nonsignificantly.
A secondary aim of this study was to determine whether
recent intake levels showed similar patterns of association to
arterial stiffness. In the male and female samples, participants
without any recent intake and those with recent heavy intake
showed no significant difference in baseline PWV compared to

 recent moderate drinkers, regardless of the extent of
covariate adjustment. In terms of longitudinal change, male
participants with no recent reported intake had significantly
higher PWV than those with recent moderate consumption (in
the maximally adjusted model, b=0.07 m/s; 95% CI=0.01–
0.13; P=0.021). No longitudinal effects were observed for the
female sample. Results for the recent alcohol intake types are
provided in Table 5.
As a sensitivity analysis following our use of multiple
imputation, complete case analyses of the long-term drinker
type were undertaken. The same significant baseline and
longitudinal associations were observed as in the imputed
data analysis, with an additional significant baseline effect
found for male stable nondrinkers. Full details of all models
are available from the first author on request.
Discussion
Using over 25 years of prospective alcohol consumption data,
this study has provided new insights into the relationship
between drinking and arterial stiffness. Male participants who
habitually consumed heavy volumes of alcohol had significantly
higher PWV than consistently moderate consumers (b=0.26 m/
s; P=0.045). All drinker types, regardless of sex, experienced
increases in their PWV from baseline across a subsequent 4- to
5-year interval, but only male former drinkers showed signif-
icantly accelerated progression (b=0.11 m/s; P=0.009).
The finding that male stable heavy drinkers had higher
baseline PWV than stable moderate consumers is consistent
with existing research9–12 and with the concept of a threshold
effect for alcohol’s impact on cardiovascular health.42 Com-
pared to heavier volumes, moderate intake is known to be
associated with higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a
protective factor against arterial stiffening.43 A similar effect
for stable heavy drinkers was observed among female
participants after adjustment for demographic and lifestyle
characteristics (b=0.73 m/s; P=0.029), but this was no
longer significant after additional adjustment for clinical
covariates (b=0.42; P=0.169). This difference from the male
sample may be attributable to a disparity in statistical power
because of the much smaller number of female stable heavy
drinkers. However, it may also be attributable to sex
differences in how the alcohol-PWV relationship is con-
founded by other clinical characteristics. Increased high-
density lipoprotein has previously been shown to be associ-
ated with lower PWV in males, but not females, whereas
triglycerides were a significant predictor of PWV in both
sexes.44
There was also evidence in the female sample that
unstable moderate drinkers had higher baseline PWV com-
pared to the stable moderate group. This effect was again
significant after adjustment for demographic and lifestyle
characteristics
(b=0.44 m/s;
P=0.015),
but

clinical
covariates (b=0.28 m/s; P=0.091). Research into variable

 alcohol intake patterns has shown that triglyceride levels may
attenuate the relationship between such variable intake levels
and cardiovascular disease risk.45
When drinker type was defined according to recent intake
only, the sole significant effect was for increased PWV
progression
among
male
nondrinkers
(b=0.11 m/s;
P=0.009). This association was also found by Matsumoto
et al,22 the only previous study to measure both arterial
stiffness and alcohol intake longitudinally. However, the
alternative long-term intake categorization used in the present
study has enabled the differentiation of former drinkers from
long-term abstainers and shown that it is with former drinkers
only that this longitudinal effect occurs. By capturing stability
in intake levels over time, the current study has obtained new
detail on the alcohol-PWV relationship and addressed recent
criticisms made of the wider alcohol epidemiology field.46
One-off assessments can lead to misclassification of risk
associations attributed to regression dilution.47 Comparing
the long-term and recent drinker types, 12% of male
participants with moderate recent intake had predominantly
drank heavily across the preceding 2 decades. Likewise, most
recent male and female nondrinkers were former drinkers
rather than long-term abstainers (supplementary results are
available from the first author on request). Only when longer-
term intake data are used to distinguish former drinkers from
other participants in the recent intake analysis do we observe
that former drinkers have a different risk of accelerated PWV
change compared to the other drinker types. It is clear that
the use of short-term intake levels alone can potentially mask
alcohol’s association with cardiovascular risk.
In contrast to Matsumoto et al, no significant longitudinal
effect was found here for heavy drinkers. Given the significant
effect observed for male former drinkers, of whom fewer were
sampled than heavy drinkers, it is unlikely this is attributable
to power limitations. The baseline effect for stable heavy
intake suggests that consistently heavy drinkers may expe-
rience more PWV change at a younger age compared to other
drinker types. The significant longitudinal effect for former
drinkers may partly be explained by the “sick-quitter”
phenomenon, where drinkers reduce their alcohol intake in
response to the onset of ill health.41 This is substantiated by
the finding that male former drinkers were significantly more
likely to report poorer health than stable moderate consumers
at the initial PWV assessment (supplementary results are
available from the first author on request). No such difference
was observed among the female participants, which is
consistent with the absence of a longitudinal effect for
female former drinkers.
This study endeavored to control for potential confounds of
the association between alcohol and PWV. The finding that
other risk factors for arterial stiffness, such as age, heart rate,
and arterial pressure, are significantly associated with PWV in

 the direction anticipated35,36,48 provides additional confi-
dence in our findings. The use of existing cohort data meant
that covariate selection was dependent on available data and
residual confounding may have occurred. Although most
confounders of known relevance were captured in the current
study, it may be useful to consider the potential impact of
additional unmeasured confounders, such as statin usage and
passive smoking, in future replications.
Regarding limitations, there was a possible selection bias
given that only participants who remained in the Whitehall II
study for over 2 decades took part in the PWV assessment.
Similarly, because the consumption data covered a 25-year
timespan only, it is not possible to draw inferences about
previous intake. Although our sample included consumers
who consistently drank heavily, we may not have captured
particularly high levels of consumption that could have had an
incrementally greater impact on PWV.25 This was particularly
true of the female sample, the analyses for whom had
potentially reduced statistical power relative to the male-only
analyses. Alternative thresholds for defining lighter intake
categories could also be explored where additional data are
available. The current study’s data are self-reported and so
vulnerable to estimation errors. These are issues known to
affect, but not invalidate, population survey research.49
Regarding result generalizability, etiological evidence from
the Whitehall II study has shown comparable results to
community- and population-based studies,50 and good con-
cordance has been found between the prospective data
collected in this cohort and retrospectively recalled drinking
behavior.51 Additional evaluation of data reliability and validity
would help verify this generalizability. PWV has to date only
been assessed at 2 phases of the Whitehall II study, so neither
nonlinear nor longer-term changes in PWV could be tested.
Finally, because of power limitations restricting further
typology refinement, the current study was unable to
incorporate other intake characteristics. Additional data may
provide insights into other consumption patterns, such as
episodic heavy drinking, which could further clarify the
cardiovascular disease risk associated with unstable intake
levels. Episodic heavy drinking could offset any theorized
beneficial effect of moderate alcohol intake,52 indirect
evidence of which is provided in the current study by the
PWV differences between female stable and unstable moder-
ate drinkers before adjustment for clinical factors. Limitations
in the categorization approach used here, however, do not
detract from our ability to draw comparisons to existing
studies of alcohol and PWV, given that these typically also
categorized drinking in terms of intake levels rather than
frequency.
Bearing in mind these additional considerations, this study
has furthered our understanding of how long-term alcohol
consumption is associated with arterial stiffness and its
progression over time. This study has captured drinking
profiles spanning over 2 decades and demonstrated the
differing insights obtainable from cross-sectional and longitu-
dinal descriptions of drinking behavior. The study has shown
that a consistently moderate drinking pattern is associated
with lower arterial stiffness than is heavier drinking, particularly
so among males. Discontinuation of drinking has also been
shown to be associated in males with experiencing accelerated
stiffness over time, and potential reasons for this and the
absence of an effect among females have been offered. On the
whole, the findings are compatible with the notion that
consistently moderate alcohol intake is associated with lower
cardiovascular risk, but suggest that the strength and form of
this association may somewhat vary by sex. This work has, in
particular, illustrated the new insights that can be obtained
when the stability of intake levels is taken into account.
