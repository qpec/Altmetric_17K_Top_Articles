BACKGROUND: Sharp declines in sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) in the 1990s 
and a diagnostic shift from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) to unknown cause 
and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (ASSB) in 1999–2001 have been 
documented. We examined trends in SUID and SIDS, unknown cause, and ASSB from 1990 
to 2015 and compared state-specific SUID rates to identify significant trends that may be 
used to inform SUID prevention efforts.
METHODS: We used data from US mortality files to evaluate national and state-specific 
SUID rates (deaths per 100 000 live births) for 1990–2015. SUID included infants with an 
underlying cause of death, SIDS, unknown cause, or ASSB. To examine overall US rates for 
SUID and SUID subtypes, we calculated the percent change by fitting Poisson regression 
models. We report state differences in SUID and compared state-specific rates from  
2000–2002 to 2013–2015 by calculating the percent change.
RESULTS: SUID rates declined from 154.6 per 100 000 live births in 1990 to 92.4 in 2015, 
declining 44.6% from 1990 to 1998 and 7% from 1999 to 2015. From 1999 to 2015, SIDS 
rates decreased 35.8%, ASSB rates increased 183.8%, and there was no significant change 
in unknown cause rates. SUID trends among states varied widely from 41.5 to 184.3 in 
2000–2002 and from 33.2 to 202.2 in 2013–2015.
CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in SUID rates since 1999 have been minimal, and wide variations in 
state-specific rates remain. States with significant declines in SUID rates might have SUID 
risk-reduction programs that could serve as models for other states.

WhAt’S KNOWN ON thIS SUbjECt: Sharp declines 
in sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) during 
the 1990s and a diagnostic shift beginning ∼1999 
have been documented. However, trends in SUID 
rates after 1999 and state-specific SUID rates have 
not been fully explored and may be used to inform 
prevention efforts.
WhAt thIS StUDy ADDS: There has been little 
change in overall SUID rates since 1999, but there is 
evidence of a continuing diagnostic shift between 
SUID subtypes. State SUID trends varied greatly.

 Sharp declines in the rates of sudden 
infant death syndrome (SIDS) in  
the 1990s have been associated 
with national efforts to promote 
infant safe sleep, mainly through 
the Back-to-Sleep campaign.1 The 
decline in SIDS rates since the late 
1990s has been, in part, attributed to 
a diagnostic shift that was identified 
from 1999 through 2001; some death 
certifiers are classifying fewer deaths 
due to SIDS and more deaths due 
to other ill-defined and unspecified 
causes of mortality (unknown 
cause), or accidental suffocation 
and strangulation in bed (ASSB).2 
– 
4 
Given this diagnostic shift, grouping 
SIDS deaths with deaths classified 
as due to unknown cause or ASSB 
on US death certificates as sudden 
unexpected infant deaths (SUIDs) is a 
strategy for consistently monitoring 
SUID trends.2, 
 
5
Despite declines in rates, SUID 
remains an important cause of infant 
mortality, accounting for ∼3500 
US infant deaths annually, 
6 and it 
remains a focus of national and local 
prevention efforts. The American 
Academy of Pediatrics recommends 
the following to reduce the risk of 
SUID: a supine sleep position, room 
sharing without surface sharing, 
creating a sleep environment free 
of objects that can obstruct an 
infant’s airway, and avoiding pre- 
and postnatal exposure to tobacco 
smoke.7 A thorough examination of 
US and state-specific SUID trends 
is needed to further characterize 
diagnostic shifts, understand state 
differences, and provide insight 
into the potential impacts of and 
opportunities for prevention efforts.
Knowledge of recent national 
and state trends of SUID can help 
measure progress toward the 
Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) goal 
of reducing SUID deaths to 84 per 
100 000 live births.8 Understanding 
how state-level data compare with 
this goal may help programs make 
critical decisions about resource 
allocation for prevention activities. 
States with declining SUID rates 
may have implemented successful 
programs that can be adapted in 
states with higher or stagnating SUID 
rates. In this study, we examine US 
rates of SUID and SUID subtypes 
(including SIDS, unknown cause, and 
ASSB) and state-specific SUID rates  
to identify significant trends that  
can be used to inform future SUID 
risk-reduction strategies.
MEthODS
We used data from the US 
compressed mortality file to evaluate 
national and state-specific SUID 
rates for 1990 through 2015.6, 
 
9 We 
calculated rates per 100 000 live 
births for overall SUID and each SUID 
subtype. In this analysis, SUID was 
defined as an infant (<365 days old) 
with an International Classification 
of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) 
or International Classification of 
Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code 
for SIDS, unknown cause, or ASSB.10, 
 
11  
Underlying cause-of-death ICD-9 
codes 798.0 (SIDS), 799.9 (unknown 
cause), and E913.0 (ASSB) were 
used for deaths occurring from 1990 
through 1998; and ICD-10 codes R95 
(SIDS), R99 (unknown cause), and 
W75 (ASSB) were used for deaths 
occurring from 1999 through 2015.2 
Examining SUID rates overall and by 
subtype allowed us to examine if the 
diagnostic shift has continued in later 
years.2, 
 
3
To examine trends in US rates for 
SUID overall and by subtype (SIDS, 
unknown cause, and ASSB), we  
used SAS version 9.3 for Windows 
(SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) to 
calculate the percent change  
(PC = [(eβ)years − 1] × 100%), and 
we calculated the 95% confidence 
intervals by fitting a Poisson 
regression model in SAS to the annual 
rate data with a linear effect for year 
(on the logarithmic scale).12, 
 
13 To 
assess overall trends, we calculated 
the PC for 1990 through 2015, and to 
examine the diagnostic shift among 
SUID subtypes, we calculated the PC 
for 1990 through 1998 (before the 
shift was identified) and for 1999 
through 2015. P values <.05 were 
considered significant.
To investigate state differences in 
SUID, we compared state-specific 
SUID rates from 2000–2002 to 2013–
2015. These periods were selected 
to investigate more recent trends 
since the turn of the century. Because 
states were likely differentially 
affected by the diagnostic shift, we 
examined SUID rates, combining 
SIDS, unknown cause, and ASSB, to 
allow for more comparable rates 
across all 50 states and the District 
of Columbia. For simplicity, we 
refer to the District of Columbia as 
a state. Using 3-year time segments 
allowed for more stable estimation 
of SUID rates in states with a lower 
SUID incidence. We calculated the PC 
([(Rate1 – Rate0) / Rate0] × 100%) 
and z scores using Poisson rates 
(ln[Rate0 / Rate1] / √[1 / deathso + 
1 / deaths1]) to assess the statistical 
significance (P < .05) of the PC 
between 2000–2002 and 2013–2015. 
To visualize the changes in state-
specific rates from 2000–2002 to 
2013–2015, heat maps were created 
in ArcGIS 10.4.1. Heat map data are 
presented in quintiles, which were 
created by dividing the range of SUID 
rates over both periods into 5 equal 
intervals.
RESULtS
During the study period (1990–2015), 
 
SUID rates per 100 000 live births 
declined from 154.6 in 1990 to  
92.4 in 2015. Among SUID subtypes, 
the SIDS rate was highest, followed 
by unknown cause and ASSB rates 
(Fig 1). In 1990, SIDS accounted for 
most SUIDs and occurred at a rate of 
130.3 deaths per 100 000 live births. 
At that time, the SIDS rate was almost 
40 times higher than the ASSB rate 
(3.4 per 100 000) and 6 times higher 
than the unknown cause rate (20.9 
per 100 000). Over the study period,

 the gap between SIDS rates and the 
rates of the other SUID subtypes 
narrowed. In 2015, the SIDS rate was 
<2 times higher than either ASSB or 
unknown cause (39.3 vs 23.0 and 
30.0 deaths per 100 000 live births, 
respectively).
In Table 1, we describe the overall 
PC for SUID and SUID subtypes over 
the study period and for the years of 
1990–1998 and 1999–2015. From 
1990 through 2015, there was a PC 
of −40.5% for SUID, −70.9% for 
SIDS, 45.1% for unknown cause, and 
671.0% for ASSB (Table 1). From 
1990 through 1998, the PC was 
−44.6% for SUID, −50.9% for SIDS, 
−14.1% for unknown cause, and 
30.2% for ASSB (Table 1). From 1999 
through 2015, the PC was −7.2% for 
SUID, −35.8% for SIDS, and 183.8% 
for ASSB, with no significant change 
in unknown cause (Table 1).
In analyses of state-specific SUID 
trends, several patterns emerged 
(Table 2). All states, but Louisiana 
and Alabama, had a reduction in SUID 
when 1990–1992 was compared with 
2013–2015. In 2013–2015, 18 states 
met or exceeded the HP2020 SUID 
goal of 84 deaths per 100 000 live 
births, compared with 16 states in 
2000–2002 and 1 state in 1990–1992. 
California, Colorado, the District of 
Columbia, Florida, Kansas, Missouri, 
New York, Oregon, Washington, 
and Wisconsin had significant 
percentage declines in SUID rates 
when 2000–2002 was compared with 
2013–2015. The greatest declines 
occurred in the District of Columbia 
(−44.5%), Colorado (−40.8%), and 
Wisconsin (−37.8%). The SUID rate 
in the District of Columbia declined 
from 184.3 in 2000–2002 to 102.2 
in 2013–2015, a difference of −82.1 
per 100 000 live births. Of the states 
that declined between 2000–2002 
and 2013–2015, the SUID rates in 
Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and 
Wisconsin were above the HP2020 
goal in 2000–2002 and dropped 
below it in 2013–2015. The SUID rate 
in California exceeded the HP2020 
goal in 2000–2002 and 2013–2015.
In contrast, Alaska, Arkansas, 
Alabama, Kentucky, and Louisiana 
had the highest SUID rates in 
2013–2015, coupled with large 
significant percentage increases 
when comparing 2000–2002 with 
2013–2015. In addition, these states 
had >150 SUIDs per 100 000 live 
births, nearly twice the HP2020  
goal. Of these states, Alaska had 
the largest rate increase of 55 per 
100 000 live births from 2000–2002 
to 2013–2015 (147.1 vs 202.2).
The variability of state-specific SUID 
rates from 2000–2002 to 2013–
2015 are depicted in heat maps in 
which quintiles, 5 equal intervals 
representing the range of SUID rates 
over both periods, are compared 
(Fig 2). In 2000–2002, 6 states 
(AZ, CT, ME, MA, RI, and UT) were 
in the lowest quintile (33.3–67.1 
per 100 000 live births) and only 
the District of Columbia was in the 
highest quintile (168.5–202.2 per 
100 000 live births). In 2013–2015, 
10 states (CA, CO, CT, MA, MN, NJ, NY, 
RI, UT, and VT) were in the lowest 
quintile and 4 states (AK, AR, AL, and 
MS) were in the highest quintile.

SUID is defined as infant deaths that were assigned ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for SIDS (798.0 or R95), other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality (799.9 or R99), and ASSB (E913.0 
or W75).

 less dramatic. SIDS rates continued 
to decrease, but classification by 
subtype changed, with a significant 
increase in the ASSB rate (183.8%) 
and no significant change in the 
unknown cause rate. When the 
diagnostic shift was first identified, 
the shift was occurring from SIDS 
to ASSB and unknown cause.2, 
 
3 On 
the basis of our data, we suggest 
that, more recently, SUIDs are still 
being classified less often as SIDS 
and more often as ASSB alone. This 
diagnostic shift may have resulted 
from a variability in cause-of-death 
determination practices4 and an 
increase in the use of standard infant 
death investigation protocols.18

Trends in SUID rates mirror trends 
observed in the prevalence of some 
unsafe sleep factors since the 1990s. 
For example, soft bedding use in 
infant sleep environments decreased 
85.9% from 1993 through 1995 
and decreased only 54.7% from 
2008 through 2010.22 And, after an 
increase in supine sleep placement 
from 1992 to 1996,

no significant change from 2001 
through 2010.23, 
 
24 Conversely, the 
percentage of infants sharing a sleep 
surface significantly increased from 
6.5% in 1993 to 13.5% in 2010.25 
Given this increase, one would 
expect an increase in SUID rates. 
Further analyses are needed to fully 
understand the contribution of the 
diagnostic shift and unsafe sleep 
environments on ASSB and SUID 
rates.
The reasons some states experienced 
success in significantly decreasing 
SUID rates and others did not are 
likely multifaceted. There are a wide 
range of state strategies being used 
to reduce SUID, including but not 
limited to policies in facilities and 
clinics, Safe-to-Sleep campaigns, 
Special Supplemental Nutrition 
Program for Women, Infants, and 
Children messaging, home-visiting 
programs, and quality improvement 
collaboratives at birthing hospitals.26 
The role of these SUID risk-reduction 
programs, demographic changes, 
tobacco use, and emerging issues 
such as increasing opioid use deserve 
further investigation. The District of 
Columbia had the largest significant 
percent decrease and absolute SUID 
rate decline over the study period. In 
2000–2002, the District of Columbia 
had the highest state-specific SUID 
rate (184.3 deaths per 100 000 live 
births), approximately twice that of 
the United States as a whole (94.5 
deaths per 100 000 live births). 
However, in 2013–2015, the District 
of Columbia SUID rate dropped to 
102.2 deaths per 100 000 live births. 
Between 2000 and 2015 the racial 
and ethnic makeup of the District of 
Columbia changed considerably.27, 
 
28  
Births to Asian/Pacific Islander, 
Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white 
mothers increased from 32.8% of 
total births in 2000 to 49.4% in  
2015. In contrast, births to non-
Hispanic black mothers declined 
from 66.6% in 2000 to 50.1% in  
2015.27, 
28 In the United States,  
non-Hispanic blacks have nearly  
double the rates of SUID as Asian/
Pacific Islander, Hispanics, and 
non-Hispanic whites.29 This change in 
racial and ethnic composition likely 
contributed to the decrease in SUID 
in the District of Columbia over the 
study period. In addition, activities 
in the District of Columbia aimed 
at increasing prenatal care and 
child immunizations, preventing 
child injuries, and reducing alcohol 
use during pregnancy that were 
targeted toward the African 
American population may have 
contributed to the improved SUID 
rates.30
Beginning in 2012, several states 
participated in the Maternal 
and Child Health Bureau at the 
Health Resources and Services 
Administration initiative to reduce 
infant mortality by improving safe 
sleep practices. This initiative, known 
as the Collaborative Improvement 
and Innovation Network, engaged 
states from Region 4 (AL, FL, GA, 
KY, MS, NC, SC, and TN) and Region 
6 (AR, LA, NM, OK, and TX).31 In 
examining SUID rates from our 
analysis, it appears that among those 
states participating in Collaborative 
Improvement and Innovation 
Network since 2012, only Florida 
had a significant decrease (−10.1%) 
in SUID rates when 2000–2002 
was compared with 2013–2015. 
Analyzing national and state-specific 
SUID trends, as in this article, can 
not only be used to identify states 
that have been successful in reducing 
the SUID rate but can also be used 
to evaluate the impact of state and

SUID rates per 100 000 live births, United States, 2000–2002 and 2013–2015. SUID is defined as infant 
deaths that were assigned (ICD-10) codes for SIDS (R95), other ill-defined and unspecified causes of 
mortality (R99), and ASSB (W75). Map classes are equal quintiles across both periods.

 national initiatives when allocating 
future resources.
Our study is limited by its use 
of death certificate data, which 
lacks information about risk and 
preventive factors present at the 
time of death. This prevented us 
from being able to group cases with 
similar circumstances at death; 
without this information, it is difficult 
to determine the contribution of 
variation in how cause of death is 
assigned by different death certifiers. 
To mediate the effect of this issue, 
we report aggregated SUID data in 
addition to the SUID subtype data. 
An additional limitation is that death 
certificates are often filed with a 
“pending” cause of death until the 
death investigation is complete, 
and the official cause of death is 
consequently assigned. If the death 
certificate is not amended in a timely 
manner, these deaths are coded at 
the national level as due to unknown 
cause. This classification practice 
results in a higher prevalence of 
deaths due to unknown cause in 
the national mortality files when 
compared with state files that may be 
more accurate. This was the case in 
California in 2000 and 2001, Georgia 
in 2008 and 2009, and New Jersey in 
2009, resulting in an artificially low 
rate of SIDS and an inflated rate of 
unknown-cause deaths.2 Because we 
grouped SUID subtypes, this did not 
impact our interpretation of state-
specific SUID findings but may have 
affected our interpretation of the 
diagnostic shift at the national level. 
Conversely, the use of vital statistics 
data was an asset to our study 
because we were able to examine 
25 years of state- and national-level 
data. Another strength of this study 
is our inclusion of state and national 
trends, because most studies have 
looked at national or regional SIDS or 
SUID trends32,

CONCLUSIONS
The lack of a substantial reduction 
in US SUID rates since 1999 is 
an opportunity for programs to 
re-evaluate their strategies to 
promote safe sleep and reduce 
SIDS risk factors. Although some 
states have experienced notable 
declines, wide variations in SUID 
rates by state still exist. States that 
have been successful in significantly 
reducing their SUID rates might 
serve as models for other states 
in terms of SUID risk reduction. 
Increased understanding about the 
factors that have influenced these 
state-specific trends is needed to 
leverage successful interventions 
for adaptation by other states. 
Influencing factors may include 
state-level policies and regulations, 
as well as creative and innovative 
approaches for encouraging safe 
sleep practices.
