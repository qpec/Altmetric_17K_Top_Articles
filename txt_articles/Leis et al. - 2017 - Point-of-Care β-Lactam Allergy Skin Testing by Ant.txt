Background. β-lactam allergy skin testing (BLAST) is recommended by antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) guidelines, 
yet few studies have systematically evaluated its impact when delivered at point of care.
Methods. We conducted a pragmatic multicenter prospective evaluation of the use of point-of-care BLAST by ASPs. In stag-
gered 3-month intervals, ASP teams at 3 hospitals received training by allergists to offer BLAST for eligible patients with infectious 
diseases receiving nonpreferred therapy due to severity of their reported allergy. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients 
receiving the preferred β-lactam therapy.
Results. Of 827 patients with reported β-lactam allergy over 15 months, β-lactam therapy was preferred among 632 (76%). 
During baseline periods, 50% (124/246) received preferred β-lactam therapy based on history, compared with 60% (232/386) dur-
ing the intervention periods (P = .02), which improved further to 81% (313/386) upon provision of BLAST (P < .001) without any 
increase in incidence of adverse drug reactions (4% vs 3%; P = .4). After adjusting for patient variables and the correlation between 
hospitals, the intervention period was associated with a 4.5-fold greater odds of receiving preferred β-lactam therapy (95% confi-
dence interval, 2.4–8.2; P < .0001).
Conclusions. The use of BLAST at the point of care across 3 hospital ASPs resulted in greater use of preferred β-lactam therapy 
without increasing the risk of adverse drug reactions. Longer-term studies are needed to better assess the safety and clinical impact 
of this ASP intervention.

Reported allergy to β-lactams is detrimental to patients with 
infectious diseases. Prior observational studies have suggested 
worse clinical outcomes among those with a β-lactam allergy 
label, including increased in-hospital mortality [1] and pro-
longed length of stay [1, 2]. These patients frequently receive 
less effective second-line therapies due to their reported allergy 
[3–5] and broader-spectrum antimicrobial agents that contrib-
ute to the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance 
[2]. A recent prospective cohort study of patients with reported 
β-lactam allergy identified detrimental clinical outcomes 
among those receiving alternative second-line agents, including 
adverse drug reactions and readmission to hospital for the same 
infection [6]. Conversely, those who received β-lactam therapy 
despite their reported allergy were at no higher risk of adverse 
events than patients without this allergy label [6].
As most patients with a reported β-lactam allergy could 
safely tolerate β-lactams, promoting their use when clinically 
indicated is increasingly regarded as a function of antimicrobial 
stewardship [7–9]. The Infectious Diseases Society of America/
Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America 2016 guide-
lines for the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship pro-
grams (ASPs) recommend that these patients undergo allergy 
assessment and β-lactam allergy skin testing (BLAST) when 
appropriate [10]. This simple, inexpensive, and reliable test car-
ries high negative predictive value (97%–99%) for excluding the 
presence of immediate-type hypersensitivity [11, 12]; however, 
it is not routinely available to institutions that lack expertise in 
allergy and immunology. In addition, the quality of evidence 
to support the use of BLAST by ASPs remains weak, with few 
studies that have systematically evaluated its impact on antimi-
crobial use and clinical outcomes among hospitalized patients 
[12–14].

We conducted a prospective multicenter study with 3 objec-
tives: (1) to determine the feasibility of implementing point-
of-care BLAST as a pharmacist-led antimicrobial stewardship 
activity; (2) to evaluate the impact of BLAST on the use of 
preferred β-lactam therapy for management of patients with 
infectious diseases; and (3) to determine whether point-of-care 
BLAST is associated with improved infection-related clinical 
outcomes.
METHODS
Study Design
We performed a multicenter, prospective pragmatic evaluation 
of point-of-care BLAST at 3 participating hospitals in Toronto, 
Canada: Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre (SHSC), an aca-
demic teaching hospital with 627 acute care beds; Michael 
Garron Hospital (MGH), a 339-bed community hospital; and 
North York General Hospital (NYGH), a community hospital 
with 427 acute care beds. Each hospital site has an infectious dis-
eases (ID) consult service and an established ASP that includes 
2 full-time pharmacists who perform audit and feedback of all 
hospitalized patients receiving targeted antimicrobial therapy 
(third-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, car-
bapenems, vancomycin, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides) in 
collaboration with the ID physician on call.
All sites began baseline data collection 6 July 2015. The inter-
vention was deployed in staggered 3-month intervals beginning 
with SHSC (5 October 2015), then MGH (4 January 2016), and 
finally NYGH (4 April 2016). The intervention period contin-
ued until study completion on 30 September 2016. The study 
was approved by the research ethics board at each hospital.
Training, Roles, and Responsibilities
All pharmacists (2 at each site) and a minimum of one ID phy-
sician at each hospital completed dedicated training prior to 
offering BLAST in their ASP. Training included completion of 
certification in standard first aid and cardiopulmonary resusci-
tation, an injection training course as per the Ontario College of 
Pharmacists [15] (pharmacists only), a half-day observation in 
the Drug Safety Clinic at SHSC, and a half-day hands-on train-
ing session by a drug safety clinic allergist on how to perform 
and interpret BLAST.
Informed consent was always the responsibility of the ID 
physician, and the prick testing and intradermal injections were 
performed by trained pharmacists as a delegated act [16, 17], 
authorized by the ID physician. The β-lactam challenge was 
ordered by the ID physician and administered by the patient’s 
nurse. The ID physician was available in hospital on page 
throughout the entire procedure.
Patient Population and Eligibility for β-lactam Allergy Skin Testing
Patients with reported β-lactam allergy were identified by 
the ASP through audit and feedback and the ID consultation 
service. As part of routine clinical activities, allergy history is 
obtained and patients with reported β-lactam allergy are pre-
scribed preferred antimicrobial therapy, including β-lactam 
therapy whenever the benefit is deemed to outweigh any 
risks. These clinical assessments occurred in the same fash-
ion during the intervention period with the only difference 
being that the ASP could offer BLAST whenever the severity 
of the patient’s reported allergy prevented the ASP/ID service 
from prescribing the preferred β-lactam therapy (eg, vanco-
mycin is prescribed for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus 
aureus instead of cefazolin due to history of anaphylaxis to 
penicillin). Exclusion criteria for BLAST included history 
suggestive of prior severe non–immunoglobulin E (IgE) reac-
tions (eg, history of blistering rash, fever, mucous membrane 
involvement, joint involvement, cytopenia, renal failure), doc-
umented IgE reaction within the past 3 months, anticipated 
discharge within 24 hours of assessment, or declining consent 
to undergo BLAST.
Performing β-lactam Allergy Skin Testing
BLAST was offered on Mondays to Fridays throughout the 
study. When a patient with reported β-lactam allergy was con-
firmed to be eligible for BLAST based on the initial assessment 
by the ASP/ID service, informed consent was obtained and 
documented in the patient’s medical chart by the ID physician. 
A medication review was performed by the ASP pharmacist to 
identify and hold any medications with antihistaminic proper-
ties, when possible (see Supplementary Appendix A for details). 
BLAST was generally performed the morning after the patient’s 
initial assessment but deferred for 1–3 days in patients assessed 
on a Friday, or when there was a need to hold medications with 
antihistaminic properties for >1 day.
Trained ASP pharmacists performed prick testing and 
intradermal injections, which were read at 15 and 30 minutes, 
respectively. All negative BLASTs were followed by a β-lactam 
challenge followed by a 4-hour observation period by the 
patient’s nurse. Full details regarding allergy testing protocol are 
available in Supplementary Appendix B. All patients with neg-
ative intradermal testing and β-lactam challenge were immedi-
ately switched to preferred β-lactam therapy. Their allergy label 
in the hospital electronic medical record was updated with the 
date and results of the negative allergy testing. Additionally, all 
patients were provided a letter explaining the significance of 
the negative test for being able to receive β-lactam antibiotics 
in the future, and were encouraged to share this letter with their 
outpatient pharmacy and community healthcare providers (eg, 
outpatient pharmacist, family doctor, dentist).
Data Collection
All inpatients reviewed by the ASP through audit and feed-
back and the ID consultation service with a reported β-lactam 
allergy were included in the study. De-identified data were

prospectively recorded into an electronic data capture system 
including patient characteristics such as age, gender, comorbid-
ities, and length of hospital stay at time of assessment. Allergy 
history was prospectively collected and classified into one of 
the following categories: simple rash, intolerance (nonaller-
gic), unknown, severe IgE-mediated (including urticaria or 
hives, angioedema, or anaphylaxis), or severe non–IgE medi-
ated (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal 
necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, drug 
rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms or serum sick-
ness). Only the antimicrobial therapy received following the 
initial assessment by ASP/ID service was recorded. Whether 
preferred therapy was a β-lactam was determined based on the 
initial assessment by the ID physician. When preferred therapy 
was a β-lactam, any patient who received a non-β-lactam or a 
β-lactam that was broader in spectrum than the preferred ther-
apy (eg, meropenem instead of piperacillin-tazobactam) was 
considered to be receiving nonpreferred therapy. Each site allo-
cated the specific patient’s therapy as preferred or nonpreferred 
based on their own assessment. For simplicity of analysis, group 
assignment (either preferred or nonpreferred therapy) as deter-
mined based on this initial assessment did not change even if 
new clinical information or culture results became available 
later. Development of any adverse reaction to antibiotic therapy 
was recorded for all patients in the study, regardless of whether 
or not they received preferred β-lactam therapy.
Following study completion, clinical outcomes were 
abstracted retrospectively including discharge date, readmis-
sion to hospital, reason for readmission, and any delayed com-
plications of antimicrobial therapy. The independent abstractor 
was blinded to whether or not patients received preferred ther-
apy or underwent BLAST, and the study period (baseline vs 
intervention).
Study Outcomes and Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables of inter-
est. Continuous measures were summarized using means and 
standard deviations whereas categorical measures were summa-
rized using counts and percentages.
The primary outcome was the proportion of patients receiv-
ing preferred β-lactam therapy during the intervention periods 
compared to baseline. This analysis was carried out using a 
generalized estimating equation (GEE) model with a logit link 
function, adjusting for the correlation among observations at 
the same hospital and the time period, as well as the following 
patient-level variables: comorbidity index, admission to critical 
care unit, and presence of a positive blood or sterile site culture.
Secondary outcomes were development of any adverse drug 
reaction related to antibiotic therapy received, length of hospital 
stay from the time of assessment (analyzed using a linear model 
adjusting for correlation among hospitals), and a composite of 
30-day infection-related readmission or death (also analyzed 
using a GEE model). All analyses were carried out using SAS 
version 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
In total, 827 patients reviewed by the ASP/ID service through-
out the study reported a β-lactam allergy, including 632 (76%) 
in whom β-lactam therapy was preferred and 195 (24%) in 
whom no antibiotics were indicated or non-β-lactam was pre-
ferred. The specific reported β-lactam allergy was a penicillin 
in 557 (88%), a cephalosporin in 43 (7%), and both in 32 (5%) 
of cases. The patient characteristics of those in whom β-lactam 
therapy was preferred are displayed in Table 1. There was older 
age among patients during the baseline period (P = .01) and 
a higher proportion with positive blood cultures during the 
intervention periods (P = .01); otherwise, the groups were sim-
ilar with notably no significant difference in the proportion of 
patients with history of severe IgE-mediated reactions (P = .2).
Among 386 patients during the intervention period, 232 
(60%) received preferred β-lactam therapy following ASP/ID 
assessment during the intervention period while 154 (40%) 
were eligible for BLAST (Table 2). Among these, 64 (42%) were 
excluded: 5 (8%) with history of severe non-IgE-mediated reac-
tions, 14 (22%) with documented IgE-mediated reaction within 
the prior 3 months, 22 (34%) who were being discharged within 
24 hours of assessment, 13 (20%) who refused to consent, and 
10 (16%) whose nonpreferred therapy became the preferred 
treatment for management of their infection based on follow-up 
clinical or microbiologic information. The remaining 90 (58%) 
eligible patients underwent BLAST, of whom 85 (94%) were neg-
ative, 4 (4%) were nondiagnostic (histamine prick test negative), 
and 1 (1%) was positive. All 85 patients with negative BLAST 
tolerated the β-lactam challenge and 84 were switched to pre-
ferred β-lactam therapy, of whom 1 (1%) developed a nonsevere 
rash 1 day later requiring discontinuation and 83 (99%) tolerated 
β-lactam course without any immediate complications.
Table 2 displays the study outcomes at all 3 hospitals. A sig-
nificant increase in the use of preferred β-lactam therapy was 
noted at each hospital during the intervention period, com-
pared to baseline. Overall, 50% (124/246) received preferred 
β-lactam therapy at baseline, compared with 60% (232/386) 
during the intervention periods based on history alone 
(P = .02), which improved further to 81% (313/386) upon pro-
vision of BLAST (P < .001). The proportion of days of penicillin 
nearly tripled (11% vs 32%; P < .0002), whereas carbapenem 
and fluoroquinolone use decreased by more than half (28% vs 
13%; P < .0002).
Receipt of preferred β-lactam therapy was increased among 
patients admitted to the critical care unit (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1–4.0; P = .02) and with high 
comorbidity index (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0–1.4; P = .06), whereas 
culture positivity was not statistically significant (P = .4). After

 β-Lactam Allergy Skin Testing • CID 2017:65 (1 October) • 1063
adjusting for these variables and the correlation between hos-
pitals, the intervention period was associated with a 4.5-fold 
greater odds of receiving preferred β-lactam therapy (95% CI, 
2.4–8.2; P < .0001). Table 3 depicts the patients who received 
preferred β-lactam therapy during baseline and intervention 
periods based on severity of their reported IgE-mediated allergy. 
Among those with reported severe IgE-mediated reaction, there 
was no significant difference in the receipt of preferred β-lactam 
therapy during the intervention period following initial ASP/ID 
service assessment but, following BLAST, a significant increase 
was noted (P < .01).
With respect to secondary clinical outcomes, there was no 
significant difference in infection/treatment-related 30-day 
readmission or death, or hospital length of stay at any of the 
hospitals and no difference overall before or after adjusting for 
predictor variables (data not shown). Despite the increase in 
preferred β-lactam therapy, there was no change in the inci-
dence of adverse drug reactions during the intervention period 
(3% vs 4%; P = .4).
DISCUSSION
In this pragmatic multicenter prospective evaluation, ASP

therapy increased significantly at all 3 hospitals following 
availability of BLAST, without any significant increase in anti-
biotic-related adverse drug reactions.
Safely preserving the use of β-lactam therapy among patients 
with reported allergy is the mandate of ASPs, and begins with 
collecting an appropriately detailed history to confirm that 
β-lactam therapy can be safely administered despite the patient’s 
allergy label [10]. A prior quasi-experimental evaluation of a 
clinical algorithm to assessing β-lactam allergies resulted in 
a significant decrease in alternative second-line agents with-
out any increase in adverse events [18]. Similarly, we noted 
improved use of preferred β-lactam therapy following clinical 
assessments during the intervention period, likely due to a more 
systematic approach to allergy history assessment in determin-
ing whether patients were eligible for BLAST.
Despite this, between 20% and 30% of patients reporting 
β-lactam allergy have a history of severe IgE-mediated reac-
tions, which requires formal allergy testing to exclude per-
sistent hypersensitivity before being able to safely prescribe 
β-lactam therapy [18]. This clinical reality is reflected in our 
data, which showed that receipt of preferred β-lactam therapy 
among this subgroup of patients remained unchanged dur-
ing the intervention period based on history alone, and only 
increased significantly with provision of BLAST (Table 3). 
This simple bedside test provided the necessary reassurance 
for both patients and clinical teams to administer the pre-
ferred β-lactam therapy despite a history of prior severe IgE-
mediated reaction.
While ASPs are mandated across hospitals, many institu-
tions lack access to expertise in allergy including BLAST. Our 
study suggests that BLAST is a feasible ASP activity as it was 
successfully implemented across both academic and commu-
nity hospital settings. With appropriate training, we believe 
that the combined pharmacist–physician model for perform-
ing BLAST among patients with documented infectious dis-
eases has several advantages. Pharmacists already play a central 
role in ASPs, and BLAST is an opportunity to expand this role 
[10]. Once trained to perform BLAST, this skill can be main-
tained even when different physicians and trainees rotate on 
the clinical service. In addition, pharmacists are ideally suited 
to identify and prepare patients for BLAST, including clarifi-
cation of the allergy history and medication review to identify 
those with antihistamine properties that should be held prior 
to performing BLAST.
Introduction of BLAST was associated with improved use of 
β-lactam therapy at all 3 hospitals compared to baseline. The 
use of penicillin nearly tripled while alternative agents associ-
ated with greater risk of Clostridium difficile infection, such as 
fluoroquinolones and carbapenems, decreased by more than 
half. Interestingly, the use of vancomycin remained unchanged 
throughout the study, which may be related to its ongoing use 
as combination therapy among patients who also received pre-
ferred β-lactam therapy. The improved antibiotic prescribing 
practices were not associated with any measured reduction in 
hospital length of stay or infection-related readmission or death 
within 30 days. Whether the use of BLAST can improve these 
outcomes for patients with reported β-lactam allergy remains 
highly plausible given the known adverse outcomes associated 
with these reported allergies [1–6], but our study was simply 
underpowered to detect this difference.
We also identified challenges in offering BLAST to all eligi-
ble patients. Similar to other evaluations of inpatient BLAST 
[19], the most common reason for exclusion was the patient 
being discharged within 24 hours of the clinical assessment. 
The BLAST procedure itself is also labor intensive as it requires 
nearly 1 hour at the bedside and clinical reassessment after the 
β-lactam challenge before switching to preferred therapy. For 
this reason, we deliberately reserved BLAST for patients who 
would be most likely to benefit. Prior studies have evaluated 
the use of proactive BLAST for all hospitalized patients with 
reported β-lactam allergy [20, 21] or patients with infectious 
diseases who report β-lactam allergy [19], while we limited

the use of BLAST to patients with infectious diseases where 
β-lactam therapy was the preferred treatment but could not 
be administered safely due to the severity of the reported 
β-lactam allergy. Utilizing BLAST at the point of care when it 
can alter patient management may be more feasible for ASPs 
that have limited resources due to other competing steward-
ship interventions.
Our study has several important limitations. First, the 
number of patients who underwent BLAST in our multi-
center evaluation was relatively small and not powered to 
detect improvement in clinical outcomes and overall safety 
of this intervention. As our study was primarily designed to 
evaluate the feasibility of performing point-of-care BLAST by 
ASPs, the specific testing protocol should be adapted to other 
institutions in consultation with allergy specialists. Second, 
receipt of preferred β-lactam therapy as our primary outcome 
was defined based on the ID physician’s recommendation and 
not standardized between hospitals. However, each hospital’s 
own definition of preferred β-lactam therapy remained con-
sistent throughout the study, and independently observed 
improvement was noted at each hospital site compared to 
baseline. Finally, changes in prescribing practices could have 
been related to confounding variables, but we performed mul-
tivariate analysis to adjust for receipt of preferred β-lactam 
therapy.
Our study demonstrates the feasibility of performing BLAST 
as an antimicrobial stewardship activity to safely promote the 
use of preferred β-lactam therapy, especially when the history 
is not sufficient to exclude a severe IgE-mediated reaction. 
Longer-term studies are needed to better assess the safety and 
clinical impact of this ASP intervention.
