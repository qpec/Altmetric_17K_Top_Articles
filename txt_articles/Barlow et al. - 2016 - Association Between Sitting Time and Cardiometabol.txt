Abstract
Introduction
Objective estimates, based on waist-worn accelerometers, indicate
that adults spend over half their day (55%) in sedentary behaviors.
Our study examined the association between sitting time and car-
diometabolic risk factors after adjustment for cardiorespiratory fit-
ness (CRF).
Methods
A cross-sectional analysis was conducted with 4,486 men and
1,845 women who reported daily estimated sitting time, had meas-
ures for adiposity, blood lipids, glucose, and blood pressure, and
underwent maximal stress testing. We used a modeling strategy
using logistic regression analysis to assess CRF as a potential ef-
fect modifier and to control for potential confounding effects of
CRF.
Results
Men who sat almost all of the time (about 100%) were more likely
to be obese whether defined by waist girth (OR, 2.61; 95% CI,
1.25–5.47)  or  percentage  of  body  fat  (OR,  3.33;  95%  CI,
1.35–8.20) than were men who sat almost none of the time (about
0%). Sitting time was not significantly associated with other cardi-
ometabolic risk factors after adjustment for CRF level. For wo-
men, no significant associations between sitting time and cardi-
ometabolic risk factors were observed after adjustment for CRF
and other covariates.
Conclusion
As health professionals struggle to find ways to combat obesity
and its health effects, reducing sitting time can be an initial step in
a total physical activity plan that includes strategies to reduce
sedentary time through increases in physical activity among men.
In addition, further research is needed to elucidate the relation-
ships between sitting time and CRF for women as well as the un-
derlying mechanisms involved in these relationships.
Introduction
Prolonged sitting time characterizes the daily lifestyle patterns of
most people living in developed countries (1). Estimates of medi-
an reported sitting time for US adults range between 6.5 to 8 hours
per day (2). Objective estimates, based on waist-worn accelero-
meters, indicate that adults spend over half their day (55%) in
sedentary behaviors (3). Several studies demonstrate direct, inde-
pendent associations between sedentary behavior and cardiometa-
bolic risk factors such as adiposity and fasting blood glucose level
after adjustment for the beneficial effect of moderate-intensity to
vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA), accumulated mostly
during leisure or discretionary periods of the day (4). However,
within a 24-hour period, people spend a significant proportion of

 waking hours in sedentary behaviors or light-intensity physical
activities relative to time spent in MVPA (1). Therefore, investig-
ators recently argued that accounting for an individual’s total
physical activity level during the entire waking period, not just
during isolated segments of the day (eg, time spent sitting or time
spent highly active), is essential to understanding the complex re-
lationships between physical activity behavior and cardiometabol-
ic risk factors (5). Furthermore, objectively measured total activ-
ity level per day appears to be more strongly associated with cardi-
ometabolic risk factors than is MVPA per day (6).
Given that cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) reflects a person’s ha-
bitual physical profile and overall general health, the primary goal
of our study was to determine whether among adult men and wo-
men time spent sitting was associated with elevated levels of waist
girth, body mass index, body fat percentage, total cholesterol, low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and
resting systolic blood pressure; low levels of high-density lipopro-
tein (HDL) cholesterol; and the presence of metabolic syndrome.
Secondary goals were to 1) examine whether CRF confounded or
modified the associations between sitting time and cardiometabol-
ic risk factors and 2) explore whether the role of CRF differed by
sex.
Methods
Participants included in this cross-sectional analysis received a
preventive medical examination at the Cooper Clinic in Dallas,
Texas, during 2010 through 2013 and provided written consent to
participate in the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study (CCLS). Par-
ticipants in CCLS are generally healthy and self-referred or re-
ferred by their employers to the Cooper Clinic for preventive med-
ical examinations that include a physician-administered medical
examination, fasting laboratory studies, body composition meas-
urements, and a maximal treadmill graded exercise test. For our
analysis, to eliminate the potential for a disease condition that
could affect the exposure of interest (eg, a stroke may result in in-
creased sitting time), participants were excluded if they reported a
personal history of cardiovascular disease (n = 51), stroke (n =
27), or diabetes (n = 582) or if they did not reach 85% of their pre-
dicted maximal heart rate on the treadmill test (n = 137). Parti-
cipants were also excluded if their data for some covariates were
missing (n = 332). These criteria resulted in an analytic sample of
1,845 women and 4,486 men aged 20 to 79 years. Each year, the
Cooper Institute’s institutional review board reviewed and ap-
proved the overall study. Our study also received exempt status
from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston’s
Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects.
Sitting time was based on participants’ responses to a question on
the medical history questionnaire completed before their clinical
examination. The sitting question, derived from the Canada Fit-
ness Survey (7), assessed the proportion of time spent sitting dur-
ing work, school, and housework during waking hours on a typic-
al day. Response options were 1) almost none of the time (about
0%), 2) approximately one-quarter of the time (about 25%), 3) ap-
proximately half of the time (about 50%), 4) approximately three-
quarters of the time (about 75%), and 5) almost all of the time
(about 100%).
Cardiometabolic risk factors (primary dependent
measures)
Body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) and body composition measure-
ments (% body fat, waist girth) were measured during the prevent-
ive medical examination. These measurements were taken accord-
ing to standard procedures by trained technicians and described
previously (8). Briefly, BMI was computed as weight in kilo-
grams divided by height in meters squared measured on a sta-
diometer and a standard physician’s scale. Participants with BMI
of 30 kg/m2 or higher were classified as obese (9). Waist girth
(cm) was measured with a plastic tape at the level of the umbil-
icus following a normal exhalation. An elevated waist girth for
men was 102 cm or greater and for women was 88 cm or greater
(10). Percentage of body fat was determined by measuring 7 skin-
fold sites (axilla, chest, abdomen, triceps, hip, thigh, and back)
with calipers and inserting the sum of these skinfold measure-
ments in a generalized body density equation to estimate percent-
age of body fat (11). Sex-specific cut points of percentage of body
fat (<25% or ≥25% for men and <32% or ≥32% for women) were
used to classify patients as obese (12).
Serum samples taken after patients fasted for 12 hours were ana-
lyzed for lipids by using automated bioassays in accordance with
standard procedures. Elevated lipid levels were defined by using
the following cut points: total cholesterol higher than 200 mg/dL;
LDL cholesterol higher than 100 mg/dL; HDL cholesterol less
than 40 mg/dL for men and less than 50 mg/dL for women; trigly-
cerides 150 mg/dL or higher; and fasting blood glucose 100 mg/
dL or higher (10).
Resting blood pressure was auscultated as the first and fifth
Korotkoff sounds according to a standard sphygmomanometer
protocol (13). Elevated blood pressure was defined as a systolic
blood pressure 130 mm Hg or higher or diastolic blood pressure
85 mm Hg or higher, or both (10).
Using the criteria of the American Heart Association and the Na-
tional Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, we defined metabolic syn-
drome as meeting 3 or more of the following criteria: abdominal

 obesity (waist girth: ≥102 cm for men and ≥88 cm for women);
high triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL); low HDL (<40 mg/dL for men
and <50 mg/dL for women); high blood pressure (systolic blood
pressure ≥130 mm Hg, or diastolic blood pressure ≥85 mm Hg, or
physician-diagnosed history of hypertension); and high glucose
(fasting blood glucose ≥100 mg/dL or physician-diagnosed his-
tory of high glucose) (10).
Covariates
CRF was assessed by using the time to complete a treadmill-
graded exercise test and the modified Balke protocol described
previously (14). Duration on the treadmill is highly correlated with
measured oxygen consumption (VO2) (r = 0.92 for men [15] and r
= 0.94 for women [16]). A value for maximal metabolic equival-
ent of tasks (METs) was estimated from the final speed and grade
of the treadmill test (17).
Participants were asked to report the frequency and duration of 11
specific physical activity types: walking, running, treadmill, swim-
ming, stationary cycling, bicycling, elliptical, aerobic dance, rack-
et sports, vigorous sports, and other activity. These 11 activity
types represent high-intensity MVPA. Summary estimates were
computed by weighting the product of the reported frequency and
duration (in minutes per week [min/wk−1]) by a standardized es-
timate of the MET of each activity type (18), which was then
summed across all activities performed. The leisure-time physical
activity estimate was expressed as a log transformation of MET/
min/wk−1.
On the basis of literature, we included additional covariates from
the medical history questionnaire: age, sex, alcohol consumption,
and smoking status. Alcohol consumption was calculated as the
combined number of drinks per week of beer, wine, and hard li-
quor. Smoking status was categorized as current smoker or
nonsmoker based on self-reported behavior. Three variables were
created to indicate current medication use (yes/no) for hyperten-
sion, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia; a fourth variable, hormone re-
placement therapy, was created for women only. Medication use
was reported by the patient to the study physician who conducted
the medical examination.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive characteristics of the study sample are presented by
sex and for the total sample. To examine crude associations, we
tested for linear trends reflecting the prevalence of each outcome
for each sex across increasing categories of self-reported sitting
time (ie, about 0% of the time to about 100% of the time). First,
the potential effect modification of CRF on self-reported sitting
time and each cardiometabolic risk factor was explored with the
addition of an interaction term to a logistic regression model in
which sitting time and CRF were used to predict each outcome.
Next, CRF was added to the fully adjusted model to control for
confounding effects after we determined that the effect size in-
creased more than 10% with its inclusion in the fully adjusted
model. Results are presented for each risk factor regressed against
self-reported sitting time 1) adjusted for age (y) (model A); 2) ad-
justed for age and cardiorespiratory fitness (METs) (model B); and
3) adjusted for all covariates in model B and for self-reported
physical activity (MET-minutes per week), alcohol consumption
(drinks per week), smoking status (yes/no), waist girth (in models
with lipids, glucose, or blood pressure as the outcome), and medic-
ation use associated with the outcome (model C). The presence of
multicollinearity between self-reported physical activity and CRF
was assessed and found to be weakly correlated (r = 0.34). Ana-
lyses were performed using SAS/STAT version 9.4 (SAS Institute,
Inc). All significance testing was 2-sided with a P value of less
than .05 considered significant.
Results
The average age of the analytic sample (n = 6,331) was 50.7 (SD
10.0) years old and consisted of mostly men (71%) (Table 1).
Eight percent of patients reported current smoking. Alcohol con-
sumption was moderate (median [25th, 75th percentile], 4 [1, 9]
drinks per week). A higher percentage of men (41%) than women
(13%) reported sitting most or all of the time (≥75% of the time)
during a usual day. The average CRF level was 11.6 (SD 2.2)
METs for men and 9.8 (SD 1.9) METs for women.
For men, high self-reported sitting time was significantly associ-
ated with high prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors, includ-
ing elevated waist girth, percentage of body fat, and obesity (all P
for linear trend < .05) (Table 2). No associations were observed
for the other risk factors or metabolic syndrome. Similarly, for
women, high self-reported sitting time was significantly associ-
ated with high prevalence of elevated waist girth and percentage of
body fat, obesity, and metabolic syndrome (all P for linear trend <
.001). In addition, the more women sat, the higher their levels of
triglycerides and the lower their levels of HDL cholesterol (both P
for linear trend < .001). For women, no associations were ob-
served between self-reported sitting time and total cholesterol,
LDL cholesterol, glucose, or blood pressure.
Next, we assessed the role of CRF as an effect-modifying variable
by adding a self-reported sitting time × CRF interaction term to
the models for each separate cardiometabolic outcome. This inter-
action term was not significant for any of the cardiometabolic risk
factors after adjustment for covariates for either men or women
(all P > .05).

 For men, the crude associations that were observed between self-
reported sitting time and each measure of adiposity remained sig-
nificant after covariate adjustment, including CRF (Table 3). More
specifically, in model C, men who reported sitting about 100% of
the time were more than twice as likely to be obese whether
defined by waist girth (OR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.25–5.47), or percent-
age of body fat (OR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.35–8.20) relative to men
who sat about 0% of the time. Similar to the results for men, asso-
ciations between self-reported sitting time and each measure of
adiposity were seen among women (Table 3) when adjusted for
age (model A). However, unlike men, when CRF was added to the
model (model C), these associations for women were no longer
significant. Self-reported sitting time was not associated with the
remaining risk factors among men or women (Appendix).
Discussion
Our findings suggest that prolonged sitting is associated with high
levels of adiposity among men even after accounting for their CRF
level. However, this relationship between self-reported sitting time
and adiposity was not found for women. Furthermore, for men,
other cardiometabolic risk factors (elevated lipids, blood glucose,
triglycerides, and blood pressure; low levels of HDL; and the pres-
ence of metabolic syndrome) were not significantly associated
with sitting time. For women, self-reported sitting time was not as-
sociated with any individual cardiometabolic risk factor or the
presence of metabolic syndrome.
Previous cross-sectional studies report significant associations
between sedentary behavior and various cardiometabolic risk
factors after controlling for MVPA (19,20). However, these stud-
ies probably suffer from incomplete ascertainment of an individu-
al’s exposure to physical activity given that only a small portion of
the day was examined (ie, 3% of their day assuming 30 minutes
per day of MVPA during 16 waking hours), which in turn could
explain the significant associations found in published study res-
ults. In their study of National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) participants, Maher et al found high-sensitiv-
ity C-reactive protein and triglycerides to be the only cardiometa-
bolic risk factors associated with sedentary behavior when con-
trolling for total physical activity time as assessed with accelero-
meters, which produce information about activity throughout the
day (5). Although these associations reached statistical signific-
ance, the relationships were weak and not of clinical significance.
In addition, a prospective study of men in the CCLS cohort found
that prolonged TV viewing and time spent in a car were detriment-
ally linked only to a marker of insulin sensitivity (but not to other
cardiometabolic risk factors) when CRF was taken into account
(21).
Similar to the results from NHANES (5), our study found that
self-reported sitting time was not associated with cardiometabolic
risk factors other than obesity for men when reported physical
activity level or cardiorespiratory fitness level are taken into ac-
count. However, little evidence exists of studies having explored
the potential role of CRF in the relationship between estimates of
total sitting time and cardiometabolic risk factors. The role of CRF
appeared to differ for men and for women, and this finding also
deserves further study. More specifically, for men, CRF confoun-
ded the relationship between sitting time and cardiometabolic risk
factors: men had higher levels of muscle mass (70 kg) than wo-
men (50 kg), which might protect men against the adverse effect
of prolonged sitting on lipids, glucose, and blood pressure, but not
against the accumulation of body fat. For women, CRF may have
confounded the effect of sitting time on some risk factors, but it
did not modify this relationship. A previous cross-sectional study
of the CCLS cohort found that the more women sat, the lower
their fitness level (22). Therefore, high levels of time sitting dur-
ing the day could lower fitness levels and lower total daily caloric
expenditures, which could lead to increases in women’s body fat.
For different levels of CRF, we found no sex-related difference in
the relationship between sitting time and cardiometabolic risk
factors.
Our study findings have public health and clinical implications:
they indicate that, among men, increased self-reported long sitting
time is related to a higher likelihood of obesity. These results
along with other published study results point to a relationship
between prolonged sedentary time and increased risk for chronic
conditions and premature mortality among both men and women
(23,24). Reducing total sitting time and incorporating activity
breaks into one’s daily schedule lowers cardiometabolic risk (25).
The American Cancer Society Guidelines on Nutrition and Physic-
al Activity for Cancer Prevention underscores the need to reduce
total sitting time along with habitually engaging in MVPA (26).
Therefore, developing and implementing programs specifically to
reduce and break up sitting time at home and work is paramount.
Primary care providers can play an important role in encouraging
their patients to change their sedentary behavior. One study found
that physicians were significantly more likely counsel their pa-
tients about the value of physical activity than to counsel them
about the risks associated with sedentary behavior (27). Tools,
such as the Rapid Assessment Disuse Index specifically tailored
for use at the point of care, can be used by physicians to assess pa-
tients with high levels of sitting and low levels of physical activ-
ity and provide pertinent and effective counseling (27). In addi-
tion, the 5As model (28), which has been used successfully to pro-
mote physical activity in primary care, can be applied to sedentary
behavior counseling.

 Strengths of this study include a direct estimate of CRF, a compre-
hensive analytic approach, and a large sample size with numerous
clinical covariates. Limitations of note were the self-reported
measure of sitting time (which has not been validated), character-
istics of the sample, and cross-sectional study design. More spe-
cifically, participants were asked to report estimates of time spent
sitting during a typical day in broad categories which could result
in misclassification of the exposure. In addition, participants were
generally healthy, predominantly non-Hispanic white, and well-
educated. The homogeneous nature of the cohort decreased the
ability to generalize these results to more diverse populations.
However, the socioeconomic homogeneity of this cohort reduced
the likelihood of confounding by unmeasured factors such as oc-
cupation, income, and other socioeconomic indicators known to
influence health. The cross-sectional study design limited report-
ing to the description of associations and thus results do not imply
causality.
The more men sat, the more likely they were to be obese by any
definition (ie, BMI, percentage of fat, waist circumference), but no
other cardiometabolic risk factors were significantly associated
with sitting time. For women, after adjustment for CRF and other
covariates, no significant associations were observed between sit-
ting time and cardiometabolic risk factors. Our results support
physicians who work with their male patients to control risk
factors by advising them to reduce sitting time to avoid obesity
and its associated health conditions. The reduction and interrup-
tion of sitting time can be an initial step in developing a total phys-
ical activity plan that includes strategies to reduce sedentary time
through increases in physical activity. Assessment of the entire in-
tensity spectrum of behaviors from sleep to vigorous-intensity
physical activity will provide health professionals with the inform-
ation needed to tailor physical activity plans for risk reduction and
health promotion.

a Response options were 1) almost none of the time (about 0%), 2) approximately one-quarter of the time (about 25%), 3) approximately half of the time (about
50%), 4) approximately three-quarters of the time (about 75%), and 5) almost all of the time (about 100%).
b Model A, adjusted for age; model B, adjusted for age and cardiorespiratory fitness (metabolic equivalent of tasks [METs]); and model C, adjusted for all covariates
in model B plus physical activity (MET-minutes per week), alcohol consumption (drinks per week), current smoking status, waist girth (in models with lipids, glucose,
or blood pressure as the outcome), and hormone replacement therapy (women only).
