Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Observational studies demonstrate links between patient-centered 
communication, quality of life (QOL), and aggressive treatments in advanced cancer, yet few 
randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of communication interventions have been reported.
OBJECTIVE—To determine whether a combined intervention involving oncologists, patients 
with advanced cancer, and caregivers would promote patient-centered communication, and to 
estimate intervention effects on shared understanding, patient-physician relationships, QOL, and 
aggressive treatments in the last 30 days of life.

 DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Cluster RCT at community- and hospital-based 
cancer clinics in Western New York and Northern California; 38 medical oncologists (mean age 
44.6 years; 11 (29%) female) and 265 community-dwelling adult patients with advanced 
nonhematologic cancer participated (mean age, 64.4 years, 146 [55.0%] female, 235 [89%] white; 
enrolled August 2012 to June 2014; followed for 3 years); 194 patients had participating 
caregivers.
INTERVENTIONS—Oncologists received individualized communication training using 
standardized patient instructors while patients received question prompt lists and individualized 
communication coaching to identify issues to address during an upcoming oncologist visit. Both 
interventions focused on engaging patients in consultations, responding to emotions, informing 
patients about prognosis and treatment choices, and balanced framing of information. Control 
participants received no training.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—The prespecified primary outcome was a composite 
measure of patient-centered communication coded from audio recordings of the first oncologist 
visit following patient coaching (intervention group) or enrollment (control). Secondary outcomes 
included the patient-physician relationship, shared understanding of prognosis, QOL, and 
aggressive treatments and hospice use in the last 30 days of life.
RESULTS—Data from 38 oncologists (19 randomized to intervention) and 265 patients (130 
intervention) were analyzed. In fully adjusted models, the intervention resulted in clinically and 
statistically significant improvements in the primary physician-patient communication end point 
(adjusted intervention effect, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.06–0.62; P = .02). Differences in secondary 
outcomes were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—A combined intervention that included oncologist 
communication training and coaching for patients with advanced cancer was effective in 
improving patient-centered communication but did not affect secondary outcomes.
TRIAL REGISTRATION—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01485627
The National Cancer Institute, the National Academy of Medicine, the American Society for 
Clinical Oncology, and the National Priorities Partnership all call for improved patient-
physician communication in the context of serious and life-limiting illnesses, citing effects 
of good communication on quality of care and quality of life (QOL) and an ethical mandate 
that patients be offered participation in informed decisions regarding their care.1–4 In 
advanced cancer, inadequate communication about prognosis and treatment choices is 
common5–7 and is associated with unrealistic patient expectations regarding curability,8 
provision of aggressive treatment that is not concordant with patients’ wishes and enrollment 
in hospice too late to deliver discernable benefit.8–12 Critical conversations typically do not 
happen, or happen in hospital shortly before a patient’s death.13
Making high-quality conversations happen is difficult. More than 90% of patients with 
advanced cancer say they want to be actively involved in their care and value frank and 
sensitive conversations about QOL, prognosis, and treatment choices.10,14,15 Yet patients are 
often reluctant to be assertive, ask questions, request clarification, express emotions directly, 
or state opinions and preferences.16 As death approaches, patients express considerable

 ambivalence about end-of-life discussions, often indicating that now is “not the right 
time.”17–20 Similarly, while most clinicians indicate willingness to have these discussions 
“now,” few follow through.21,22 More typically, clinicians wait for patients to signal interest, 
then offer prognostic information that is optimistically biased.23,24
Prior attempts to improve patient-physician communication in advanced cancer have had 
limited impact. Intensive workshops inconsistently improve trainee communication 
behaviors25,26 and are impractical for busy clinicians. Brief individualized in-office 
interventions using expert feedback on video recorded encounters improved oncologists’ 
empathy and patient-reported trust,27 but this approach has not been applied to other 
communication behaviors, such as delivery of prognostic information. Patient coaching 
increased discussion of cancer pain,28 and, in palliative care, question prompt lists (QPLs) 
have increased question-asking29—but only when physicians encouraged patients to ask 
questions.
The Values and Options in Cancer Care (VOICE) study30 combined 2 interventions, a brief 
individualized oncologist skill-based training, and individualized patient and caregiver 
coaching incorporating a QPL. Based on an ecological model of patient-clinician 
communication, both interventions were designed to promote the involvement in care that 
patients and families desire but rarely request and emphasized the same communication 
skills and topics identified in prior research: engaging patients to participate in the 
consultation, responding to patients’ emotions, informing patients about prognosis and 
treatment choices, and framing information in a balanced manner.6,18,29,31–35 The primary 
outcome was patient-centered communication in these domains. Secondary outcomes were 
shared understanding, patient-physician relationships, QOL, and health care utilization at the 
end of life.33
Methods
Overview
We conducted a multisite cluster randomized clinical trial (RCT) of an intervention to 
improve communication between patients (and caregivers when available) and oncologists. 
Oncologists randomized to the intervention arm participated in individualized 
communication training using standardized patient-instructors (SPIs), while their patients 
(with caregivers) participated in an individualized communication coaching session with 
follow-up telephone calls. After a prerandomization phase designed to assess baseline 
communication patterns of participating oncologists, we enrolled participants (from August 
2012 through June 2014) and followed them until October 2015. We obtained institutional 
review board approval for all study sites, and participants provided written informed consent 
and received $15 per questionnaire completed. See the published study description36 and the 
eAppendix in Supplement 1 for the study protocol and descriptions of the interventions and 
Supplement 2 for the statistical analysis plan.

 Settings and Participants
We conducted the study in community-based cancer clinics (4), academic medical centers 
(3) and community hospitals (3) in Western New York and Sacramento, California.
Physicians—We recruited medical oncologists who care for patients with nonhematologic 
cancers at practice meetings at participating clinics. The mean physician age was 44 years; 
27 (71%) were male; 17 (45%) were white, 16 (42%) were Asian, and 5 (13%) were of other 
race.
Patients—With clinic staff, research assistants reviewed clinic rosters of enrolled 
physicians to contact potentially eligible patients age 21 years or older, able to understand 
spoken English and provide written informed consent, and who had either stage IV 
nonhematologic cancer or stage III cancer and whose physician “would not be surprised” if 
the patient were to die within 12 months.37,38 We excluded inpatients and those in hospice. 
We first recruited 3 to 4 “prerandomization” patients per physician who agreed to have 1 
office visit audio recorded and complete questionnaires before and after the office visit. 
After physician randomization, we recruited a new cohort of patients, up to 10 per physician, 
for the cluster RCT (eTable 1 in Supplement 3) until we reached the target sample size of 
265 patients. Cluster RCT patients also agreed to an audio recorded office visit and previsit 
and postvisit questionnaires; in addition, they agreed to participate in intervention or control 
conditions, complete questionnaires quarterly for 3 years, and to have their medical records 
abstracted. Patients were blinded to study arm assignment until completion of baseline 
measures.
Caregivers—Research assistants asked patients to identify “a family member, partner, 
friend, or other individual involved with your health care issues, preferably someone who 
comes to physician appointments with you.” Eligible caregivers were 21 years or older and 
able to understand spoken English and provide written informed consent.
Interventions
The experimental intervention36 included (1) a 2-session in-office physician training (1.75 
hours) using a brief video, feedback from standardized patients portraying roles of patients 
with advanced cancer who also critiqued up to 2 audio recorded study patient visits, and (2) 
a single 1-hour patient and caregiver coaching session incorporating a question prompt list to 
help patients bring their most important concerns to their oncologist’s attention at an 
upcoming office visit, plus up to 3 follow-up phone calls (Table 1; eTable 2 in Supplement 
3). Trainers and coaches underwent 3-day on-site trainings. To promote patient-centered 
communication about disease course, prognosis, treatment decisions and end-of-life care, 
physician and patient interventions focused on the same 4 key domains of patient-centered 
communication.36 Intervention sessions were audio recorded and reviewed by lead trainers 
and investigators using a fidelity checklist. Fidelity was 94% or higher.
All intervention physicians completed both training sessions. All intervention patients 
received in-person coaching; of the 52% who responded to a mailed survey, 87% “would 
recommend coaching to other patients with cancer”; and 85% were able to ask “all” or

 “most” of their “most important” questions. Of the 130 coached patients, 94% participated 
in ≥1 follow-up call (≥2 calls, 78.7%; 3 calls, 58.3%); reasons for nonparticipation were 
death and/or illness (47.1%), unreturned phone calls (47.1%) and refusal and/or withdrawal 
(5.8%). Control physicians and patients received no training.
Data Collection and Outcome Measures
We audio recorded the first physician visit after the coaching session (for intervention) or 
after study entry (control). The primary outcome was a composite of 4 prespecified 
communication measures matched to the goals of communication training, described in 
detail in Table 1—engaging patients in consultations (Active Patient Participation Coding 
[APPC]39), responding to patients’ emotions (Verona VR-CoDES41,42), informing patients 
about prognosis and treatment choices (Prognostic and Treatment Choices [PTCC] 
Informing subscale44) and balanced framing of decisions (PTCC Balanced Framing 
subscale44). The composite score derived from these scales were designed to capture key 
elements of 6 interrelated functions of communication outlined by the National Cancer 
Institute: fostering healing relationships (APPC), exchanging information (PTCC), 
managing uncertainty (PTCC), making decisions (APPC, PTCC), responding to emotions 
(Verona), and enabling patient self-management (APPC).47 Coding of the 4 measures was 
performed by teams of trained university students who were audited continuously and 
blinded to study hypotheses and group assignment. We transformed each of the 4 component 
scores to z scores based on the prerandomization phase sample means (SDs):
The 4-component z-scores were averaged to form the primary outcome, a composite 
measure with better overall precision and sensitivity than the individual components for 
assessing intervention effects on the multiple targeted communication goals.
We assessed patient-physician relationships using The Human Connection (THC) scale,48 
the Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ),49 and the Perceived Efficacy in Patient-
Physician Interactions (PEPPI) scale50 shortly after the audio recorded visit. Physicians and 
patients were also asked to estimate 2-year survival and curability of the patient’s cancer on 
a 7-point scale (100%, about 90%, about 75%, about 50/50, about 25%, about 10%, 0%, 
don’t know); discordance was defined as 2 or more categories of difference.
We administered QOL questionnaires at 3-month intervals from study entry for up to 3 years 
and prespecified a composite QOL score to be the average of 5 z-scored subscales: McGill 
QOL scale single item, McGill Psychological Well-Being subscale, McGill Existential Well-
Being subscale, FACT-G Physical Functioning subscale, and FACT-G Social Functioning 
subscale51,52; all are widely used in research in advanced cancer. Fewer than 3% of follow-
up questionnaires were missing.
Trained nurses and physicians abstracted utilization data from medical records at relevant 
hospitals, offices, and hospice organizations. Based on a review of the literature,9,53–55 we 
prespecified a composite utilization score of 3 indicators of aggressive treatment in the last

 30 days of life (chemotherapy, potentially burdensome interventions, emergency department 
[ED]/hospital admission) and hospice utilization (eTable 3 in Supplement 3).
Randomization and Blinding
We randomized by physician and stratified by site (New York or California) and oncologist 
subspecialty (≥50% vs <50% of patients with breast cancer) to balance sex and other 
unmeasured patient characteristics that might be associated with the communication 
outcomes. Within strata, we randomly assigned physicians at a 1:1 ratio to intervention or 
control. We recruited, obtained consent, and enrolled patients based on the arm to which 
their physician was assigned. We oversampled patients with caregivers to achieve 
recruitment goals for a companion study of caregiver bereavement. Only the study 
statisticians were aware of the random number sequences and treatment assignment, 
preserving blinding among transcriptionists, coders, and abstractors.
Sample Size
To affect utilization and patient outcomes meaningfully, we felt a moderately large effect on 
communication would be needed. To account for attrition and variance inflation arising from 
cluster randomization, we used standard formula as well as simulation studies using SAS 
statistical software to determine that a target sample size of 38 physicians and 265 patients 
would yield the effective sample needed to provide at least 80% power (2-sided testing, α = .
05) to detect standardized effects of 0.50 for the primary communication outcome.36
Statistical Analysis
Between-group comparisons on communication and utilization outcomes were conducted 
using Wald-type tests from prespecified mixed-effects linear regression models (for 
continuous outcomes) and generalized estimating equations for binary outcomes, specified 
to account for the nesting of patients (the units of analysis) within physicians (the units of 
randomization). For all regression analyses, covariates for study site and breast cancer 
subspecialty were included to account for the stratified randomization, as well as patient-
level covariates to adjust for demographic and cancer characteristics. Between-group 
comparisons of QOL trajectories were performed using the terminal decline model (TDM) 
of Li et al56 that accounts for mortality by jointly modeling QOL and survival using 
piecewise linear regression and exponential hazards regression models, respectively. The 
TDM parameterizes time counting backward from patient time of death and is specified with 
2 periods for each component, the “terminal decline” period nearest death and the more 
remote period before then; our model extends on Li et al56 to permit the inclusion of study 
covariates. We chose 9 months and 12 months as the duration of the terminal decline period 
for QOL and mortality, respectively, based on the observed change point in the data.
For the analysis of communication outcomes, we used the prerandomization data to adjust 
for between-physician differences among the 38 physician clusters. Hence, the data sets for 
these mixed models analyses included observations from prerandomization and 
postrandomization audio recordings, and the models included fixed-effects terms for phase 
(prerandomization vs postrandomization), study arm, and the interaction of phase and arm. 
Intervention effects were estimated as the between-arm difference in adjusted mean

 difference from prerandomization to postrandomization samples. For the other continuous 
outcomes, only postrandomization data were included, and intervention effects were 
estimated as adjusted mean differences. In model validation and exploratory analysis, 
heterogeneity of treatment effects was assessed by adding interaction terms to regression 
models to compare intervention effects across prespecified subgroups. Residual plots were 
also used for model validation.
Statistical analyses (Supplement 2) were conducted in version 9.4 of the SAS System.
Results
Study Participants
Of 52 physicians contacted, 43 enrolled and 38 participated in the cluster RCT (eFigure 1 in 
Supplement 3). Of the 265 participating patients, 194 (73.0%) had an enrolled caregiver. 
Patient characteristics across study arms were well matched (eTable 1 in Supplement 3); 
mean age was 64.4 years, 55.0% were female, 11.5% were nonwhite, 28.0% had high school 
education or less, and 19.0% reported income of $20 000 or less. The mean follow-up for 
patients was 15 months; by study closing (October 1, 2015), 151 patients had died, 18 had 
withdrawn, and 1 was lost to follow-up (eFigure 1 in Supplement 3). We abstracted all 
decedents’ medical records.
Primary Outcome
In fully adjusted models, the composite communication score showed a significant 
intervention effect (estimated adjusted intervention effect, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.06–0.62; P = .02) 
(Table 2; eTable 4 in Supplement 3). The sample standard deviation of the composite from 
the prerandomization cohort was 0.53, hence the estimated intervention effect of 0.34 
corresponds to a standardized effect of 0.64, corresponding to 5.7 additional “engaging” 
statements (a 44% increase), 0.6 additional responses to emotion (a 71% increase), and 1.4 
additional statements regarding prognosis and treatment choices (a 38% increase).
Secondary Outcomes
Of the individual communication component measures, only the engaging measure (APPC) 
was statistically significant. There were no statistically significant effects of the intervention 
on the PEPPI, THC, or HCCQ scales, or on 2-year survival and curability estimates; 2-year 
survival discordance was 59% in the intervention group vs 62% for control; corresponding 
figures for curability discordance were 39% and 44%. Quality of life was stable until 6 to 9 
months prior to death, with a terminal decline (eFigure 2 in Supplement 3); overall, QOL 
differences between intervention and control were not statistically significant. We observed 
no intervention effects on health care utilization.
Exploratory Outcomes
None of the prespecified candidate effect modifiers were associated with heterogeneity in 
treatment effects on communication outcomes. Median survival was 16 months: 19 months 
in the intervention group and 14 months in the control (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.61–
1.15) (eFigure 3 in Supplement 3).

 Discussion
In this study, a brief combined intervention targeting physicians, patients with advanced 
cancer, and their caregivers (when available) promoted patient-centered communication in 
the near term, with clinically meaningful increases in engaging patients in discussions, 
responding to emotions and discussions of prognosis and treatment choices. These 
communication domains are linked; provision of information or emotional support, for 
example, may depend on a patient cue or request as well as a clinician’s willingness and 
capacity to respond. Of the 4 communication domains, the most fundamental, engaging 
patients as active partners in care—being assertive, asking questions, requesting 
clarification, expressing opinions and preferences to a greater degree than control patients—
was independently significant in secondary analyses. Our approach was individualized and 
tailored to participants’ educational needs; it was theory-based, highly rated by patients, 
caregivers, and oncologists, and focused on important domains of patient-centered 
communication but whose incorporation into practice remains elusive.1,9–11 While prior 
reports suggest that activated patients and those receiving bad news may rate their physicians 
more harshly,8,57 we did not observe these effects, perhaps because our intervention focused 
on aligning patient, caregiver, and physician expectations.
Despite calls for improved patient-centered communication between oncologists and their 
patients and evidence that linking end-of-life discussions with more realistic prognosis 
estimates, better QOL and reduced utilization of aggressive treatments,8–12 there has been 
little headway over the past 20 years. Many patients hold unrealistically optimistic 
prognostic estimates,8,11,21,58,59 which they mistakenly believe their physicians share60; 
future studies can unravel how to interrupt the temporarily adaptive but ultimately 
dysfunctional pas de deux, in which physicians, caregivers, and patients avoid, euphemize, 
or misinterpret these discussions.61–64 Oncologists need better training in the provision of 
information to patients with varying levels of health numeracy and literacy as well as “terror 
management,” a defense mechanism that may prompt some patients (and physicians) to 
respond to fear of death through avoidance and selective attention.65–67 Venues already exist 
for communication and awareness training during residency and fellowship,25,68,69 and 
interventions such as ours are feasible for practicing oncologists.
Consistent with prior data,70,71 QOL is remarkably stable during the course of cancer, until 
the terminal decline. It is possible that the timing of the intervention may have not have been 
optimized to affect QOL trajectories. Future patient and caregiver interventions might be 
targeted to key junctures in the clinical course, such disease progression, symptoms, or early 
declines in QOL. Because patient-centered timing of interventions poses logistic and 
methodological difficulties, training existing office personnel to coach patients might better 
adapt to patient needs. While outpatient palliative care consultations may improve QOL, 
widespread implementation for all patients with advanced cancer is unrealistic; oncologists 
still need to communicate disease-related information clearly, respond to emotions, help 
patients make choices, and facilitate referrals when indicated.72
We observed no intervention effects on utilization. The 2 study sites have moderate to high 
use of palliative care and low to moderate use of aggressive interventions,73 possibly

 limiting room for improvement. As expected, utilization outcomes clustered by physician, 
suggesting that addressing underlying physician attributes74 and institutional norms75–77 
might also be needed to address utilization of aggressive interventions and hospice.
In addition to the study limitations addressed herein, the choice of only 2 study sites may 
limit generalizability, and the use of more than 1 audio recorded office visit and different 
measures of patient-centered communication57 may have revealed patterns that were not 
observed here. Median survival in this study was 16 months, longer than anticipated, during 
which time the intervention effects may have waned. Lengthier physician interventions may 
have reinforced skills more effectively, but at a price: longer training could limit 
participation to only the most motivated physicians. Similarly, longer or more intensive 
patient interventions might not be feasible for patients who are symptomatic or close to 
death.
Conclusions
Although clinician-patient communication patterns are difficult to change,78 an intentionally 
brief communication intervention was effective in improving patient-centered 
communication in advanced cancer but requires refinement in focus, delivery, support, or 
timing to promote shared understanding, QOL, and appropriate use of health care at the end 
of life. The current productivity-oriented practice environment also presents barriers to 
effective communication. Changes are needed in medical education and health systems to 
provide communication skills training for physicians, meaningful support for them to 
participate, and trained personnel to coach patients so that their voices can be heard.

 Key Points
Question
Can communication between patients with advanced cancer and their oncologists be 
improved?
Findings
This cluster randomized clinical trial of communication training for oncologists paired 
with previsit coaching for patients showed clinically and statistically significant 
improvement in patient-centered communication.
Meaning
Paired communication training for patients and oncologists helps achieve patient-
centered care in advanced cancer: engaging patients in consultations (asking questions, 
expressing preferences), responding to emotions, and providing information about 
prognosis and treatment choices.

Table 1
Communication Domains That Promote Patient Involvement in Care Through Being Better Engaged, Responded to, Informed, and Debiased
Communication Domain
Goal of Intervention
Examples of Physician 
and Patient Behaviors
Measure
What Is Measured
Reliability and Validation
Engaging
Engaging patients and CGs to 
be more active participants in 
clinical care. Oncologists 
acknowledge and endorse the 
use of QPLs, encourage 
questions, and encourage 
participation in decision-
making. Patients ask relevant 
questions that clarify their 
values and preferences and are 
emboldened to participate in 
decisions to the degree they 
wish.
Physician: Asking 
patients what questions 
are most important to 
them. Bringing attention 
to the QPL.
Patient: Asking 
questions, expressing 
concerns and opinions, 
requesting clarification
APPC39
Absolute number of active 
patient communication 
behaviors (eg, asking 
questions, requesting 
clarification, expressing 
opinions) and facilitative 
physician behaviors 
(partnership-building and 
supportive talk, eg, empathy, 
reassurance and praise), coded 
from audio recordings
Intraclass correlations for patient 
behaviors were 0.91–0.97 and for 
physician behaviors were 0.82–0.91
Higher scores associated with patient 
preference for a shared, patient-
centered model of care40
Responding
Responding to patients’ 
emotions (expressed as direct 
concerns and indirect cues) by 
listening and offering 
acknowledgment, legitimation, 
empathyand support. Patients 
are comfortable participating 
more actively in the 
consultation.
Physician: Identifying 
patient emotions, 
opening the door for 
further exploration, 
expressing empathy
Patient/CG: expressing 
emotions, eg, fear and 
sadness
Verona VR-CoDES system41,42
Percentage of physician 
responses to patients’ 
emotional cues and concerns 
that were coded as “opening 
space” (eg, acknowledgment, 
support) vs “closing space” 
(eg, cutoff, change of topic), 
coded from transcripts
Discrepancies were adjudicated first 
by consulting the coding manual then 
by 1 of the investigators (R.G.) (all 
discrepancies were in identifying 
indirect “cues”; there was agreement 
on all “concerns” and “responses”)
Informing
Informing patients about 
disease, prognosis and 
treatments; assessing desire for 
information; checking 
understanding. Patients and CGs 
ask for information and 
clarification.
Physician: Asking 
patient what he or she 
wants to know about 
prognosis and treatment 
choices. Explicitly 
checking patient 
understanding using an 
“ask-tell-ask” approach.
43
Patient: asking specific 
questions about the 
disease, treatment 
choices, prognosis, QOL
PTCC,44 Informing subscale
The number of statements 
discussing curability, survival, 
future quality of life and 
future functional status, coded 
from transcripts
Developed by Shields et al44 for an 
unannounced standardized patient 
study of physician communication in 
cancer settings and adapted and 
divided into 2 subscales for this study. 
Informing subscale contains 9 items.
Intraclass correlation was 0.75
Balanced framing
Framing positive and negative 
aspects of a decision to reduce 
biases introduced by 1-sided 
presentation of data.
Physician: Indicating 
percentage of patients 
likely to benefit from a 
treatment and 
percentage who are 
unlikely to benefit
Patient: Asking about 
the pros and cons of 
important choices
PTCC,44 Balanced Framing 
subscale
Number of (1) expressions of 
probabilities in a balanced 
fashion (eg, 60% chance of 
cure and 40% chance of 
relapse) or (2) occurrences of 
“best case/worst case” 
framing of future

bCommunication outcomes adjusted for site, breast cancer physician, patient age, sex, race, education, and aggressive cancer. Effects estimated with robust standard errors in 2-level mixed-effects linear 
regression models (with random intercepts for physicians) and expressed as adjusted between-arm differences in mean changes from prerandomization to postrandomization. The ICC for the Index score of 
aggressive care at the end of life was 0.166; ICCs for all other outcomes were less than 0.1.
cThe APPC codes active patient statements, such as asking questions, asking for clarification, and expressing opinions. The Verona VR-Codes system first identifies patients’ cues and concerns, then codes 
physician responses as “opening space” for discussion of emotions or not. The revised PTCC Informing scale includes content items relating to assessing the patient’s knowledge of the state of disease, 
asking the patient what they wish to know about the future (eg, prognosis, curability), assessing patient understanding, how the disease is changing for the worse, future QOL, palliative care, advance 
directives, curability, estimated survival. The PTCC Balanced Framing subscale includes whether the physician used “best case/worst case” or double framing of survival or curability estimates.
dThe QOL outcomes (at each participant’s most recent measurement) are summarized with means (SDs). Intervention effects are reported as adjusted mean differences at death and were estimated in 
terminal decline models using all available longitudinal quality of life assessments. These models statistically adjust for differential mortality and include covariates to statistically adjust for baseline 
measure, site, and breast cancer physician. When computing summative subscale scores for all survey measures, we replaced missing item values with the participant’s mean response (on the same 
interview date) to other subscale items, provided that at least 50% of the subscale items were nonmissing.
