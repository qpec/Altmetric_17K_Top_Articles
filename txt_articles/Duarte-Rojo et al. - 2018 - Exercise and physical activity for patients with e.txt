Sarcopenia and physical deconditioning are frequent complications in patients with cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease
(ESLD). They are the end result of impaired dietary intake, chronic inflammation, altered macronutrient and micronutrient
metabolism, and low physical activity. Frailty is the end result of prolonged sarcopenia and physical deconditioning. It severely
affects a patient’s functional status and presents in approximately 1 in 5 patients on the liver transplantation waiting list. Sar-
copenia, poor physical fitness/cardiopulmonary endurance (CPE), and frailty are all associated with increased mortality in
ESLD. Clinical trials addressing the usefulness of exercise in patients with cirrhosis have shown that it improves the metabolic
syndrome, sarcopenia, CPE, health-related quality of life, and hepatic venous pressure gradient. Although evidence on the
benefits of exercise on clinical outcomes derived from large clinical trials is still missing, based on existing literature from mul-
tiple medical subspecialties, we believe that an exercise program coupled to a tailored nutritional intervention benefits both
cardiopulmonary and musculoskeletal functions, ultimately translating into improved functional status, sense of well-being,
and possibly less complications from portal hypertension. In conclusion, although supervised exercise training is the prevailing
approach to manage ESLD patients, such intervention is not sustainable or feasible for most patients. Innovative home-based
physical activity interventions may be able to effectively reach a larger number of patients.

Management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis
and end-stage liver disease (ESLD) has become more
standardized over the last couple of decades. Refinement
in therapeutic techniques has decreased mortality from
ascites and its complications, whereas improved under-
standing of the pathophysiology of portal hypertension
is helping reach better treatment goals for acute kidney
injury and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Likewise,
treatment of specific diseases, such as hepatitis C, hepa-
titis B, and locoregional therapy for hepatocellular carci-
noma, have all facilitated stabilization of disease toward
a more favorable outcome, on occasions including suc-
cessful liver transplantation (LT). However, mortality
for patients with ESLD continues to be high, and in
2015, over 3000 patients in the United States were
unable to reach LT as a consequence of progressing dis-
ease or death. Acute-on-chronic liver disease and infec-
tious complications are leading indications for hospital
admission and prolonged hospital stay, severely affecting
an ESLD patient’s functional status and mortality. In
recent
years,

 conditions indirectly resulting from ESLD and pro-
longed illness, including malnutrition, sarcopenia, poor
functional status, and frailty (Fig. 1). Although interre-
lated, each of these conditions can independently affect
a patient’s functional status and mortality. In the present
review, we will summarize the evidence on the relevance
of these complications in ESLD, while providing a
framework for a possible change in practice aiming to
improve functionality and survival in LT candidates
through an exercise intervention.
Sarcopenia and
Malnutrition
Malnutrition is a highly prevalent complication in
ESLD patients. It is a complex condition that includes
the decrease of muscle and fat mass, body weight loss,
increased proinflammatory cytokines, anorexia, and
fatigue, resulting in sarcopenia.(1,2) Sarcopenia is de-
fined as the generalized loss of muscle mass, muscle
strength, and muscle function, and it is directly related
to adverse outcomes in this population.(1) Evaluating
malnutrition in patients with ESLD is a challenging
task given that many of the markers associated with
malnutrition are intrinsically affected in liver disease
(eg, albumin, prealbumin, lymphopenia); therefore,
skeletal muscle evaluation (mass, function, and quality)
provides an objective means to determine nutritional
status in patients with ESLD.
The gold standard for the assessment of sarcopenia
in ESLD patients is computed tomography (CT),
which measures the total cross-sectional area of the
abdominal skeletal muscles at the 3rd lumbar vertebra
(L3) level, and when normalized to the patient’s
height, yields the skeletal muscle index (SMI).(3) Sev-
eral other methods can be used to assess sarcopenia by
reflecting muscle mass directly or indirectly with vali-
dated cutoffs in the population. Dual X-ray absorpti-
ometry (DXA) is an imaging method that measures
both bone mineral and soft tissue content, allowing

FIG. 1. Conceptual framework on the interdependence between
physical fitness and nutritional status in patients with cirrhosis
and ESLD. Physical deconditioning, determined by a low CPE,
and sarcopenia, an objective surrogate for progressive malnutri-
tion, are cofactors leading to functional deterioration. As physical
deconditioning progresses, patients exercise less and use less
energy as part of NEAT. Frailty is conceptualized as the extreme
of functional deterioration where both physical deconditioning
and sarcopenia/malnutrition are present at their severest forms.
CPE and sarcopenia are herein considered intermediate outcomes
leading to clinical outcomes with increased relevance, from func-
tional deterioration to death.

 calculation of the fat-free mass index (FFMI), where
values of FFMI below the 10th percentile are consid-
ered diagnostic for sarcopenia. When ascites is present,
the appendicular skeletal muscle index (ASMI) can be
calculated instead, and an ASMI below 2 standard
deviations from the mean of a reference population is
considered as sarcopenia.(4)
Apart from imaging methods, there are some bed-
side methods commonly used for assessment of muscle
mass. Bioelectrical impedance examines the resistance
and reactance of an electric current through body tis-
sues, and it predicts values of fat-free mass, fat mass,
and intracellular and extracellular water. The latter has
been shown to be influenced by the presence of ascites;
therefore, direct markers such as phase angle (PhA) or
body cell mass are preferred over the predicted values.
Bioelectrical impedance–derived PhA is a nutritional
marker that reflects the integrity of cellular membranes
and water cell distribution (ie, by relating resistance
and reactance), what in nutritional terms translates
into muscle and fat mass. Therefore, values of PhA
below the cutoff established for the population are con-
sidered diagnostic for muscle/fat mass depletion and
malnutrition and are not affected by fluid overload.(1,5)
Mid-arm muscle circumference is a simple anthropo-
metric method that reflects the amount of muscle mass
by deducting the amount of measured fat in the triceps
and bone width. The diagnosis of sarcopenia can be
established when this value is below the 10th percentile
from a reference population.(6) Hand grip strength is a
technique that measures the amount of static force on
a dynamometer and predicts muscle function. This
technique requires the active involvement of the
patient and is not useful in patients with HE. Values
of hand grip strength below the 10th percentile of the
reference population are considered abnormal.(7)
Physical Fitness
and Cardiopulmonary
Endurance
Some terminology needs to be properly defined in
order to better understand the advantage of an exercise
intervention in ESLD and how endpoints have been
evaluated in clinical trials. According to the Institute of
Medicine, physical fitness is a state of well-being with
a low risk of premature health problems and adequate
energy to participate in a variety of physical activities.
In this regard, physical activity makes reference to
body movement produced by the contraction of skele-
tal muscle, whereas exercise refers to planned, struc-
tured, and repetitive movement aiming to improve or
maintain physical fitness. Thus, these 3 concepts are
interrelated in such a way that physical activity and
exercise facilitate physical fitness, the latter was defined
in terms of successful performance of physical duties.
Given that physical fitness is a broad and complex con-
cept, cardiopulmonary endurance (CPE), the ability of
the heart and lungs to meet skeletal muscle demands
during extended exercise, is traditionally used in clini-
cal trials as the surrogate endpoint to quantify changes
from an exercise intervention aiming to improve aero-
bic fitness.
The most commonly used methods to evaluate
CPE in cirrhosis are cardiopulmonary exercise testing
(CPET) and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). CPET
is performed on a treadmill or in a stationary cycle
ergometer, and the patient is monitored for heart rate,
blood pressure, electrocardiogram changes, and symp-
toms, while the workload progressively increases.
Simultaneously, the gas exchange is measured yielding
results of oxygen uptake, ventilation (VE), and carbon
dioxide output (VCO2). From these, maximum oxygen
uptake (or its working equivalent, peak oxygen uptake
[VO2peak]) is the most frequently used parameter of
CPE.(8) The 6MWT is a simple test where the patient
is asked to walk quickly on a flat surface during 6
minutes, with the distance covered used as the end-
point. The test is easy to perform and essentially
requires a 30-meter hallway, a pulse oximeter, and a
stopwatch.(9)
Clinical Factors Associated
With Sarcopenia and
Physical Deconditioning in
ESLD
The etiology of sarcopenia and physical deconditioning
in patients with ESLD is multifactorial, resulting from
a combination of impaired dietary intake, malabsorp-
tion, altered macronutrient and micronutrient metabo-
lism, and low physical activity.(10) Decreased dietary
intake could result from early satiety, delayed gastric
emptying, nausea, anorexia, enforced dietary restric-
tions (sodium and protein restriction), altered taste
perception due to zinc deficiency, and chronic alcohol
consumption.(11-13) Moreover, increases in the tumor

 necrosis factor a (TNF-a) and leptin are frequent in
patients
with
ESLD
and
might
contribute
to
anorexia.(14,15) Malabsorption is also multifactorial
resulting from impaired gut motility, bile acid defi-
ciency, pancreatic insufficiency, small intestinal bacte-
rial
overgrowth,
and
bowel
edema
from
portal
enteropathy.(10-16) Impaired carbohydrate metabolism
due to hyperinsulinemia and impaired hepatic glycogen
synthesis are key contributors to altered macronutrient
metabolism. In fact, patients with ESLD enter into a
catabolic or starvation state during an overnight fast.
Rapid depletion of muscle and hepatic glycogen, free
fatty acid oxidation, and production of ketone bodies
are observed within 10 hours, as compared with 3 days
in healthy subjects.(8,9) Finally, regular physical activity
is needed to protect patients with ESLD from sarcope-
nia. However, most patients have a rather sedentary
lifestyle and self-assessments do not reliably indicate
actual performance.(17)
Molecular Mechanisms
of Sarcopenia in ESLD
Patients with ESLD have an increase in fatty acid
oxidation and gluconeogenesis early in the fasting or
postabsorptive state.(18) Because glucose is a desired
substrate in most cellular tissues and fatty acid car-
bon cannot be used for gluconeogenesis, amino acids
are used for this metabolic pathway.(19) Proteolysis
from the skeletal muscle produces aromatic and
branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) that become
the principal source of substrate for gluconeogenesis.
Accelerated starvation response and increased gluco-
neogenesis as metabolic abnormalities that cause
muscle wasting is supported by the low respiratory
quotient
found
in
patients
with
ESLD
and
sarcopenia.(18)
Myostatin (myokine also known as growth differ-
entiation factor 8) is a protein produced and released
by myocytes that acts on muscle cells in an autocrine
fashion to inhibit myogenesis, muscle cell growth,
and differentiation. Increased expression of myosta-
tin in plasma and skeletal muscle has been reported
in
patients
with
ESLD.(20)
Interestingly,
high
ammonia (NH3) levels in patients with ESLD seems
to
be
associated
with
sarcopenia
through
up-
regulation of myostatin, impaired protein synthesis,
and increased autophagy.(19) Other factors associated
with sarcopenia in ESLD include low testosterone
concentrations due to increased aromatase activity
and decreased growth hormone levels in the skeletal
muscle.(21,22)
Clinical Implications
of Sarcopenia
and Physical Fitness
Changes in skeletal muscle mass and physical fitness
have been strongly correlated with adverse clinical out-
comes (Table 1).(3,24,42) A recent meta-analysis evalu-
ating the impact of CT-assessed sarcopenia that
included 19 studies with 3803 ESLD patients showed
an independent association between sarcopenia and
wait-list and post-LT mortality. The pooled hazard
ratios (HRs) of sarcopenia were 1.72 (P 5 0.05) and
1.84 (P 5 0.02) for wait-list and post-LT mortality,
respectively, independent of the Model for End-Stage
Liver Disease (MELD) score.(43) Though not consis-
tently reported in studies,(25,26,44) sepsis may be one of
the explanations behind a higher mortality in patients
with sarcopenia.(24) In order to standardize cut points
for sarcopenia, a recent multicenter study across 5 aca-
demic transplant centers in North America included
almost 400 adult patients with ESLD awaiting LT.
This study validated the association of sarcopenia and
mortality and established cutoff values for ESLD
patients awaiting LT using the CT-SMI (�39 cm2/m2
for women and �52 cm2/m2 for men).(3) Using these
cutoff values, a recent study identified sarcopenia as an
independent predictor for HE after transjugular intra-
hepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), outperforming
traditional risk factors such as age, covert HE, and his-
tory of overt HE.(45)
Practical methods available at bedside to assess sar-
copenia have not been widely studied in cirrhosis. In a
study including 249 patients with a mean follow-up of
34 months, we identified a PhA � 4.9 8 independently
associated with increased mortality (HR 5 2.15; P 5
0.02) in patients with cirrhosis.(46) In a subsequent
study, a low PhA was also associated with incidental
HE.(47) Although these findings support the use of
bioelectrical
impedance
(PhA)
as
a
malnutrition
prognostic marker in cirrhosis, studies comparing this
technique to CT-SMI are warranted to demonstrate
validity in the determination of sarcopenia.
Importantly, modified scoring systems incorporat-
ing sarcopenia have shown promising results.(30,48)
Using the CT-SMI, we have reported that sarcopenia
was independently associated with a 2-fold risk of

 mortality, and that the modification of MELD to
include sarcopenia (MELD-sarcopenia) was associated
with improvement in the prediction of mortality in
ESLD patients.(48) The observed benefit of modifying
MELD was greatest in patients with low MELD
scores, who are at a low risk of death (Fig. 2A). The
importance of sarcopenia was reflected by the fact that
if it is present, it is equivalent to adding 10 points to
the MELD score.(48) Some studies indicate sarco-
penia has been linked with higher mortality after
LT,(23,28,29,31) whereas others have not found this
association.(30,44) Sarcopenia was found to correlate
with other post-LT outcomes such as infection, length
of hospital, and intensive care unit (ICU) stay,(31,44)
and patients with sarcopenia had higher occurrences of
post-LT infections as compared with those without
sarcopenia.(27,44) Sarcopenic obesity and myosteatosis,
the convergence of sarcopenia and obesity, and an
increase in skeletal muscle fatty infiltration, respec-
tively, are 2 recently described body composition
abnormalities that have also been associated with
increased mortality in patients with cirrhosis.(42)
Physical fitness, measured in terms of CPE, has
also been associated with mortality in ESLD patients
(Table 1). A study performing CPET in 135 LT
candidates showed that 88% of patients had impaired
fitness, with severe impairment (VO2peak < 60% or
predicted value) in 54% of patients. An inverse cor-
relation was described between VO2peak and MELD,
and VO2peak was predictive of 1-year wait-list sur-
vival (65% if severely impaired versus 96% if not;
P 5 0.003), even in patients with a MELD > 17.(36)
The 6MWT was evaluated in 121 LT candidates
and was significantly lower than a reference popula-
tion. The 6MWT was inversely correlated with
MELD score, and those patients in the lower tertile
(<250 meters) were found to have higher wait-
list mortality. In fact, every 100-meter decrease in
performance

 Physical Frailty in Patients
With ESLD
Physical frailty in patients with ESLD is characterized
by sarcopenia, malnutrition, and physical decondition-
ing with a poor functional status. Tests of physical
frailty have also been correlated with poor clinical out-
comes in ESLD, again underlining the importance of
complementing measures of muscle mass with those of
muscle function (Table 1).(38,39) Importantly, frailty
indexes improve prognostic performance of conven-
tional
scores
(ie,
MELD,
Child-Turcotte-Pugh
[CTP]) and should facilitate clinical decisions in
ESLD patients. A study on 294 LT-listed patients
using validated geriatric constructs identified frailty as
an independent mortality predictor. For every 1-unit
change, wait-list mortality increased by 19%-45%,
though predictive usefulness was particularly helpful in
those with MELD < 18.(41) More recently, the same
group validated a novel frailty index score for LT-listed
patients (consisting of grip strength, chair stands,
and balance) showing that, when combined with
Model for End-Stage Liver Disease–sodium (MELD-
Na; MELD-Na1Frailty), it outperformed risk predic-
tion with MELD-Na alone (Fig. 2B), allowing reclas-
sification of 19% of patients with or without predicted
death/delisting.(38) These findings might have some
practical implications, for instance, some patients with
irreversible frailty might benefit from strategies to
reduce the waiting time for LT, such as living donor
related transplant or acceptance of high-risk donors.(38)
Interventions Targeting
Sarcopenia and Physical
Fitness
Given the challenges associated with defining and
reversing sarcopenia, prevention during early stages of
liver disease should be the main goal. Corrective mea-
sures should be taken to address sarcopenia, poor physi-
cal fitness, or frailty. Some considerations are discussed
below.
PHARMACOLOGICAL
Testosterone was the focus of many early trials because
it was found to be significantly decreased in men with
cirrhosis. Recently, a 1-year controlled clinical trial of
intramuscular testosterone in male ESLD patients
with low serum testosterone demonstrated that testos-
terone safely increased muscle mass.(49) This finding
was supported by a second trial using a transdermal
approach.(50) These therapies would benefit only a sub-
set of ESLD patients, though there is no specific rec-
ommendation on the use of androgen replacement
therapy in ESLD, and longterm safety is unknown.
A study with in vitro and in vivo data suggests that
NH3-lowering treatment with L-ornithine-L-aspartate
restores net protein balance, which could directly impact

REVIEW ARTICLE
 recently tested in a phase 2 clinical trial, ornithine phe-
nylacetate, could potentially decrease hyperammonemia,
it is unknown whether the concomitant urinary loss of
phenylacetylglutamine would have a negative nutritional
impact. Until more data from randomized clinical trials
are available, these agents cannot be recommended for
the treatment of sarcopenia.
NUTRITIONAL
Dietary management should be implemented for every
sarcopenic patient, with regular follow-up to evaluate
response. A dedicated nutritional team for ESLD
patients is recommended, given the difficulties in-
herent to nutritional education and compliance. As a
guideline, it is recommended to aim for an energy
intake of 35-40 kcal/kg/day and a protein intake of
1.2-1.5 g/kg/day, although in patients with proven sar-
copenia, 1.5 g/kg/day may be preferred. Protein intake
should correspond to 15%-20% of the daily caloric
intake, with 50%-60% derived from carbohydrates
(primarily complex), and the rest from fat.(52) In terms
of supplementation, BCAAs are the most widely stud-
ied in ESLD patients. Numerous studies have shown a
beneficial effect of oral BCAA supplementation on
muscle mass, and the sustained intake has been asso-
ciated with improvement of health-related quality of
life (HRQoL), decreased incidence of cirrhosis-related
complications, particularly HE, and improvement
of CTP and MELD scores.(53,54) Short-term and
longterm
studies
have
established
the
safety
of
BCAA, although their main limitation can be the
low compliance due to the low palatability of some
formulations.(55-57)
Apart from BCAA supplements, the addition of a
late evening snack containing carbohydrates has also
been shown to improve muscle mass and energy
metabolism.(58) The calories derived from these snacks
can range from 200 to 400 kcal, with a clear effect even
with 200 kcal/day. The snack should contain complex
carbohydrates to prolong absorption overnight and
provide dietary fiber, and patient’s preferences should
be considered in order to improve compliance.(57-60)
The effect of hypercaloric formulations in ESLD
patients has also been evaluated. One study showed a
significant
improvement
of
nitrogen
balance
in
patients with enteral feeding immediately after LT.
Another study used an oral supplement in sarcopenic
patients listed for LT that was maintained until trans-
plantation. There was a significant improvement in
muscle mass and muscle strength, and a trend toward
higher pre-LT survival.(61)
Although enteral tube feeding is recommended in
practice guidelines for patients not able to maintain
adequate oral intake,(52) there is no robust evidence on
the usefulness of such intervention in outpatients with
ESLD.(52) Moreover, a recent study including inpa-
tients with alcoholic hepatitis failed to demonstrate
improved mortality among those receiving intensive
enteral nutrition when compared with conventional
oral nutrition; whereas, potential risks (eg, aspiration
pneumonia) were reported.(62) Until further evidence is
available, enteral feedings cannot be recommended for
frail or sarcopenic patients with ESLD.
TRANSJUGULAR INTRAHEPATIC
PORTOSYSTEMIC SHUNT
TIPS has been shown to exert a direct effect on body
composition and other markers of nutritional status.(63)
A study evaluated 57 patients undergoing TIPS place-
ment and 32 matched patients with cirrhosis without
TIPS. After a mean follow-up of 14 6 12 months,
total psoas and paraspinal CT muscle area increased
significantly only in the TIPS group. Sarcopenia
improved in 41 (72%) patients, though failure to
reverse it predicted higher mortality compared with
successful reversal (43.5% versus 9.8%).(64) Two other
studies using bioelectrical impedance have shown pro-
gressive improvement in muscle mass after TIPS.(65,66)
EXERCISE
Exercise, in general, improves skeletal muscle mass,
strength, endurance, and cardiopulmonary function.
Some of its proven benefits (eg, on atherosclerotic dis-
ease, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia) are of partic-
ular interest to ESLD patients with multisystemic
disease such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. In patients
with cirrhosis, despite the increasing interest in the
effects of exercise, few clinical trials have been per-
formed to date. A summary of these trials is presented
on Table 2. It is important to note that a nutritional
intervention was included in most exercise studies. We
certainly recommend combining exercise with a nutri-
tional intervention based on the notion that nutritional
supplementation, when added to exercise, achieves bet-
ter results than exercise alone.(74) However, for the
purposes of this review, we will focus our attention on
exercise interventions.

REVIEW ARTICLE
 Two early studies evaluated the effect of exercise in
patients with chronic hepatitis C. The first study
included 17 patients (3 patients with cirrhosis) who
received a dietary plan for 8 weeks, followed by unsu-
pervised walking for a minimum of 8000 steps/day
(electronic pedometer) thrice per week for 24 weeks.
Body composition including weight, body mass index
(BMI), visceral and subcutaneous fat mass, along with
homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
levels, significantly improved by the end of the study.
Interleukin 6 (IL6) and leptin decreased. However, no
differences were seen in TNF-a or adiponectin levels.
HRQoL
measured
with
short-form
36
(SF-36)
showed a positive trend in the vitality domain.(67) The
second
study
included
16
patients
with
obesity
(BMI > 30 kg/m2)
and
insulin
resistance
(as
per
HOMA-IR > 2), 6 of whom were patients with cir-
rhosis, to a 24-week dietary and unsupervised physical
activity lifestyle intervention. The exercise intervention
consisted of an increase of �3000 steps/day (electronic
pedometer) from baseline, or aiming for �10,000 total
steps/day (whichever represented the largest change).
As planned, caloric intake was significantly reduced
(due to baseline obesity), and this was accompanied by
a significant decrease in body weight and body fat,
ALT, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl
transpeptidase, fasting glucose, and insulin. Fifty per-
cent of patients were no longer insulin resistant by the
end of study (from hepatic insulin sensitivity). Leptin
and adiponectin improved, whereas the cytokines
showed no change. Fatigue and mood scores also
improved.(68) Although these studies were small and
focused on adiposity and insulin resistance, they pro-
vide proof-of-concept on the feasibility of unsupervised
exercise interventions in liver disease.
Four studies, including 3 randomized controlled tri-
als (RCTs), have investigated the effects of a super-
vised exercise intervention. In all cases, patients had to
attend specialized cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation
centers to exercise. In a pilot study evaluating the
acceptability of a 12-week personalized exercise pro-
gram in 13 patients with cirrhosis before LT, Debette-
Gratien et al. found an improvement in physical fitness
and muscular strength. The study design did not
include a nutritional intervention, and most patients
were CTP A. The main findings were an increase in
the VO2peak from 21 6 6 to 23 6 6 mL/kg/minute

 37 6 13 kg/force (P 5 0.008). There were no signifi-
cant changes in quality of life. In the 8 patients who
finished the protocol, there were no adverse events.(71)
Rom�
an et al. evaluated the effects of a 12-week ran-
domized trial with aerobic exercise and leucine supple-
mentation in 20 patients with cirrhosis. Of the 17
patients who finished the study, 9 were allocated to the
control group and 8 to the exercise group. Most
patients were CTP class A. In the exercise group, there
was an improvement in physical fitness following the
intervention, as determined both by the 6MWT
(median [range], from 365 [160-420] to 445 [250-
500] meters; P 5 0.01) and the 2-minute step test
(from 100 [40-140] to 150 [80-160] steps; P 5 0.02).
The lower thigh circumference, an indirect measure of
muscle mass, was also increased (from 41 [34-53] to
46 [36-56] cm; P 5 0.02). Finally, some domains cor-
responding to HRQoL were improved (3 of the 8 in
SF-36). None of these changes were noted in the con-
trol group, and no relevant side effects were evident.(69)
With a similar design, Zenith et al. studied 20 patients
(most CTP A) with an 8-week combined intervention.
Physical fitness improved in the active group after the
intervention, with a significant change in VO2peak of
5 mL/kg/minute from baseline, when compared with
the control group (0.5 mL/kg/minute; P 5 0.001).
Although the between-group difference was not sig-
nificant for 6MWT, it did improve from baseline in
the exercise (from 529 6 132 to 571 6 112 meters;
P 5 0.02) but not in the control group (from 529 6 85
to 546 6 98 meters; P 5 0.09). Increase in both thigh
circumference and depth of the right quadriceps mus-
cle determined by ultrasound were noted in the exer-
cise group. Finally, activity and fatigue subscores, and
self-perceived health status of the chronic liver disease
questionnaire (CLDQ) improved as a result of exer-
cise. Attrition rate was 1/10 in the exercise group, and
no adverse events were realized during the study.(70)
In a randomized trial, Mac�
ıas-Rodr�
ıguez et al. eval-
uated the effects of a 14-week exercise intervention
consisting of both aerobic (cycle ergometry) and resis-
tance/stretching training (kinesiotherapy), plus nutri-
tional intervention, in 29 patients with cirrhosis (most
CTP A). All patients received beta-blockers during
the study in order to prevent acute increases in portal
hypertension while exercising.(75) Both active and con-
trol groups had 11 patients who completed the inter-
vention. At the end of the study, the hepatic venous
pressure gradient (HVPG) significantly decreased in
the active group (22.5 [25.2 to 2] mm Hg; P 5 0.05),
but increased in controls (4 [0 to 5] mm Hg;
P 5 0.03), for a between-groups difference. Eliminat-
ing 3 patients with an unexplained HVPG increase in
the control group did not change the between-group
difference.
Although no changes were noted in
VO2peak,
the
ventilatory
efficiency
(VE/VCO2),
another
parameter
of
physical
fitness,
positively
changed in the active group (–1.9 [–3.2 to 0.1;
P 5 0.03] versus –0.4 [–5.7 to 1.4; P 5 0.4] in
controls). PhA from bioelectrical impedance (likely
reflecting changes in muscle mass), exercise-induced
hyperammonemia
(final
CPET),
and
the
worry
domain from CLDQ also improved in the active
group. Notably, silent ischemia was found in initial
CPET in 3 patients (eliminated from study), and a
hypertensive crisis occurred in a patient during final
CPET.(72)
A recent study evaluated the effect of a 16-week
exercise and diet (hypocaloric, reduced protein) pro-
gram in 60 overweight or obese patients with cirrhosis
(almost exclusively CTP A) and portal hypertension
(HVPG > 6 mm Hg). Exercise consisted of a person-
alized 60-minute weekly session at a local gym, aiming
for low-to-moderate intensity. Compliance with exer-
cise and diet were 88% and 84%, respectively. At the
end of the intervention, a significant decrease in
HVPG (21.7 mm Hg [–10.7%]) and increase in
VO2peak (21 6 7 to 26 6 9 mL/kg/minute, P < 0.001)
were observed. There was a significant decrease in
body weight and fat, whereas no effect in muscle mass
was observed. Notably, HVPG had a higher decrease
in the subgroups of patients with higher weight loss
(�10%). Insulin resistance, total cholesterol, and leptin
levels improved as well. Because exercise was not
intense and frequent enough to improve muscle mass,
the demonstrated changes were likely related to weight
loss.(73)
Exercise Prescription in
ESLD
Sarcopenia, physical deconditioning, and frailty are all
frequent in ESLD and negatively impact clinical out-
comes. Remarkably, these conditions can now be
objectively evaluated and even quantified, as previously
described. The recent interest in frailty assessment by
many transplant centers in the United States aims to
standardize what transplant physicians have recognized
for a few decades, that despite no objective contraindi-
cation, some patients just “do not pass the eyeball test”
for LT (ie, global perception of high vulnerability to

 stress).(41)
The
fact
that
MELD-sarcopenia
and
MELD-Na1Frailty are predictive of a higher mortal-
ity at lower MELD (<15) or MELD-Na (<18) scores
opens the possibility of implementing interventions to
improve physical fitness and sarcopenia. Ultimately,
these interventions are directed to mitigating morbid-
ity and mortality outcomes. Because exercise benefits
multiple dimensions of physiological health and well-
ness, including improvement in portal hypertension
(whether directly or indirectly through weight loss), it
is reasonable to suggest that severely sarcopenic or frail
LT candidates would benefit as well. However, these
patients are at the lower end of physical decondition-
ing, most belonging to the CTP B/C categories or
MELD > 20, and have not been included in clinical
trials so far. New data including patients with
decompensated liver disease need to emerge before a
final conclusion on the benefits of exercise across the
different stages of cirrhosis or ESLD can be reached.
In order to better understand whether the hepatol-
ogy community considers exercise an important inter-
vention in ESLD, we performed a survey asking
hepatologists about their daily clinical practice (Fig. 3).
Survey results indicated that the great majority (87%)
of hepatologists recognize the importance of exercise
and that most routinely assess whether patients exer-
cise regularly, educate them about its benefits, and pro-
vide specific exercise recommendations. Despite this
common practice our most prominent professional
associations, the American Association for the Study
of Liver Diseases and European Association for the
Study of the Liver, have yet to provide standardized
recommendations on this matter. Our lack of guidance
differs from other medical subspecialties where exercise
as an intervention has been given higher priority, thus
providing specific recommendations for daily clinical
practice (Table 3).
Preparticipation Evaluation
Exercise is remotely associated with cardiovascular
adverse events, particularly when nonvigorous activities
are being performed. The American College of Sports
Medicine (ACSM) recommends a medical evaluation
prior to sports participation (preparticipation evalua-
tion) for patients with 2 or more traditional risk factors
for cardiovascular disease (eg, diabetes, dyslipidemia,
ESLD, smoking) if vigorous activities are to be pre-
scribed. An evaluation is warranted in patients with
symptomatic or known cardiopulmonary or metabolic

 disease when planning for moderate-to-vigorous exer-
cise.(80) There is no need for clearance for patients per-
forming low-intensity activities, or if none to 1
cardiovascular risk factor are noted. Notably, no men-
tion is made about any risk related to ESLD. Although
most transplant candidates bear 2 or more cardiovascu-
lar risk factors (64% out of 204 patients evaluated in
our transplant center, Al-Shoha et. al, unpublished
data), very few have significant cardiopulmonary dis-
ease posing a contraindication for exercise. Moreover,
patients on the waiting list attain cardiopulmonary
clearance after an extensive workup, which includes
transthoracic echocardiogram, cardiac stress testing,
and pulmonary function tests. Therefore, except for
symptomatic patients or those with known heart failure
with reduced ejection fraction, portopulmonary hyper-
tension, unexplained syncope, or type 1 diabetes melli-
tus,
no
specialized
preparticipation
evaluation
is
needed for LT candidates. Moreover, most associa-
tions agree that for low-to-moderate intensity activities
not exceeding the demand of a brisk walk, there is no
need for preparticipation clearance.(76) Under these cir-
cumstances, a gradual increase from low-intensity
activities is an acceptable strategy.(81) Special consider-
ation, however, should be given to patients with mus-
culoskeletal disorders, as well as to those with frequent
falls or problems with balance, for whom specialized
consultation may be warranted.
Type, Intensity, and
Duration of Exercise in
ESLD
On the basis of randomized clinical trials (Table 2),
three 40-to-70–minute sessions per week of supervised
moderate intensity exercise (bicycle or treadmill) is a
reasonable target goal for ESLD patients. However,
apart from the research setting, it is difficult to justify
attendance of ESLD patients to cardiopulmonary
rehabilitation centers, particularly for a prolonged
period of time. Furthermore, even if logistic and finan-
cial constraints were overcome, this type of interven-
tion would be too onerous for most patients (ie, due to
transportation, waiting time, and expenses for patient
and companion). With accumulated evidence on the
safety of submaximal physical training in ESLD, con-
sideration of local resources and home-based exercise,
commonly recommended for other chronic diseases, is
appropriate.
In this regard, 30-to-60–minute sessions combining
both aerobic and resistance training to achieve �150
minutes/week is a reasonable recommendation for
ESLD patients. However, contact and strenuous activ-
ities should be forbidden. Aerobic training would be
particularly relevant to improve overall fitness and
CPE, while resistance training would help reverse sar-
copenia, improve strength and balance, and bone min-
eral density. Whether the use of weights is appropriate
for patients with esophageal/gastric varices is unclear,
and thus weight-bearing exercises or repetitions with
small weights (1-2 lbs) are advised, as well as the use of
beta-blockade when applicable. In frail patients with
severe sarcopenia, balance and stretch training de-
signed to strengthen postural muscles and improve
range of motion is recommended prior to attempting
aerobic and resistance training. Physical therapists,
particularly with geriatric specialty, are a great resource
for this initial phase. Duration of an exercise program
should entail a minimum of 3 months in order to facil-
itate physiological adaptation.(78) Depending on the
intensity of exercise and the degree of malnutrition,
dietary interventions favoring protein or supplemental
amino acid intake would be concomitantly warranted.
Until proven useful in clinical trials, a pharmacologic
intervention is not recommended (Fig. 4).
Potential Benefits
of Exercise in LT
Candidates
Despite the lack of evidence in reversing severe sarco-
penia and frailty with exercise, cardiovascular reha-
bilitation and exercise literature clearly substantiate
that, independently of the degree of physical decondi-
tioning, all patients benefit from exercise training.
Thus, it is conceivable for exercise to improve physical
fitness (cardiovascular endurance), glucose control, and
other features of the metabolic syndrome, adiposity,
skeletal muscle strength and endurance, and sarcope-
nia. Effects at the musculoskeletal level should trans-
late into improved balance (reducing propensity to
falls), ambulation, sense of well-being, and caregiver
independency. The latter is a particularly important
goal, as caregiver burnout is an unaccountable cause for
further ESLD deterioration in LT candidates. HVPG
and NH3 metabolism should improve as well, although
no study has looked into the effects of exercise on
HE or other complications derived from portal

 hypertension. Larger and better-designed clinical trials
investigating the role of exercise on clinical outcomes
in LT candidates are needed. With approximately 1 in
5 wait-list patients dying or becoming too sick to
transplant every year,(82) transplant providers are in
need of new interventions to successfully bridge our
patients to LT. Until more evidence is available, exer-

tion to help our patients remain healthier and become
less vulnerable while on the waiting list.
Future Directions
Lifestyle modification programs have been successful
in improving health and well-being in multiple areas of
medicine. Apart from tailored recommendations re-
garding exercise and diet, these programs focus on life-
style changes favoring increased activities of daily living
and
nonexercise
activity
thermogenesis
(NEAT).
Examples of NEAT and corresponding energetic costs
are shown in Table 4. NEAT is the main component
of energy expenditure (thermogenesis), even in people
who regularly exercise.(83) As such, targeting NEAT
with exercise routines complements physical training
and creates a more durable intervention. In order to
improve patient’s independency, activities of daily liv-
ing should be emphasized as part of NEAT. In a previ-
ous study including 9 patients with hepatitis C–related

 cirrhosis, patients increased their pedometer-based
daily step counts from 6910 to 9933 steps (P 5 0.01)
after 24 weeks of a lifestyle intervention program,
mainly
by
increasing
purposeful
ambulation
and
NEAT. This resulted in improved insulin sensitivity
and body fat percentage.(68)
Development of triaxial accelerometers has im-
proved accuracy of NEAT quantification.(84) More-
over, its inclusion in commercially available physical
activity trackers has popularized its use, as it is now
commonly used in weight loss or fitness programs. If
an accelerometer is used to guide exercise in ESLD
patients, it is important to note that walking at a pace
of 100 steps/minute corresponds to moderate-to-
vigorous exercise intensity.(85) Thus, to recommend
bouts of 30 minutes of exercise, patients should achieve
3000 steps during that time frame to maintain proper
exercise intensity. When combining NEAT and exer-
cise, an equivalent of 7000-10,000 steps/day is ex-
pected.(86) However, this would represent a difficult
goal for most patients with decompensated cirrhosis to
achieve, therefore gradual increases of 2000-2500
steps/day are advocated.
With the widespread availability of smartphones
providing a user-friendly platform to better program
and monitor accelerometer-guided physical activity,
there is greater potential for home-based physical
activity interventions aimed at improving daily exercise
and NEAT. As such, this strategy would overcome the
difficulties of patient referral to a tertiary physical reha-
bilitation center or dependence upon a local rehabilita-
tion center with specialized personnel. In the near
future, technological innovations using handheld and
wearable devices may be used to educate and guide
ESLD patients. This approach would help to stan-
dardize and advance comprehensive care of ESLD
patients and could translate into improved clinical out-
comes while on the LT waiting list.
In summary, sarcopenia, physical deconditioning,
and frailty are associated with poor clinical outcomes
in patients with ESLD. On the basis of available evi-
dence, moderate intensity exercise is safe for ESLD
patients, and it is not expected for patients listed for
LT to have cardiovascular contraindications to exer-
cise. We propose for patients with ESLD on the trans-
plant waiting list to perform 30-to-60–minute exercise
sessions combining both aerobic and resistance train-
ing to achieve �150 minutes/week, along with a paral-
lel increase in NEAT. Accelerometers can help track
physical activity, while aiming for an intensity of 100
steps/minute and a total of 7000-10,000 steps/day.
Tailoring of exercise intensity to patients with frequent
falls or frailty, however, is advocated. Finally, a com-
plementary
nutritional
intervention
is
mandatory
(increase in protein intake, BCAA, late evening snack),
aiming to halt the catabolic state of ESLD.
