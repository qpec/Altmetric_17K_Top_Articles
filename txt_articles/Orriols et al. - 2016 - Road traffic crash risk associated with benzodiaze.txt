AIMS
To assess potential change in medicine exposure and association with the risk of road traffic crash across a time period that started
before the implementation of a grading system warning of the effect of medicine on driving performance.
METHODS
Data from three French national databases were extracted and matched: the national health care insurance database, police
reports and the national police database of injurious crashes. Drivers involved in such crashes in France, from July 2005 to
December 2011 and identified by their national identifier, were included. Association with the risk of crash was estimated using a
case–control analysis comparing benzodiazepine and z-hypnotic use among drivers responsible or not responsible for the crash.
RESULTS
Totals of 69 353 responsible and 73 410 non-responsible drivers involved in an injurious crash were included. Exposure to
benzodiazepine anxiolytics was associated with an increased risk of being responsible for a road traffic crash during the
pre-intervention period (OR = 1.42 [1.24–1.62]). The association disappeared in the post-intervention period, but became
significant again thereafter. The risk of being responsible for a crash increased in users of z-hypnotics across the study period.
CONCLUSIONS
Our results question the efficacy of the measures implemented to promote awareness about the effects of medicines on driving
abilities. Prevention policies relating to the general driving population, but also to healthcare professionals, should be reviewed.

 WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT
• The association between the use of benzodiazepines and z-hypnotics and the risk of road traffic crashes has been
documented with consistent results in several epidemiological studies.
• A study on perceptions conducted in the Netherlands found good effectiveness of a pictogram system on medicine pack-
ages that classifies medicines according to levels of driving impairment risk.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
• The risk of being responsible for a crash associated with benzodiazepine anxiolytics decreased immediately after the
introduction of the colour-graded pictogram but increased again over time.
• The increasing risk associated with z-hypnotic use, despite the presence of a warning pictogram, highlights the need for
further preventive interventions.
Introduction
The association between the use of benzodiazepines and z-
hypnotics (zolpidem and zopiclone) and the risk of road traf-
fic crashes has now been documented with consistent results
in several epidemiological studies [1–15]. In France, using a
record-linkage study of national databases, we showed that
benzodiazepines and z-hypnotics accounted for the largest
share of the risk attributable to exposure to medicines [10].
The impact of other drugs found to be more common among
drivers involved in a crash could not be fully disentangled ei-
ther from a potential effect of the associated medical condi-
tion or from an associated driving behaviour carrying more
risk [16].
In 2003, the French National Agency for Medicines and
Health Products Safety appointed a multidisciplinary group
of experts to classify all medicines according to four levels
of risk in terms of their effect on driving performance [17].
A graded pictogram was designed to be printed on the outer
packaging of all level 1–3 medicines (Figure 1) and pharma-
ceutical companies gradually implemented this policy from
2005 to 2006. Levels 1, 2 and 3 medications are labelled with
instructions that are relevant to driving for patients.
Because the European commitment to introduce a harmo-
nized pictogram is recent (2005), only one study investigated
the effect of such an intervention. Indeed, a study conducted
in the Netherlands on perceptions using structured inter-
views of patients visiting a pharmacy found good effective-
ness of a pictogram system on medicine packages that
classifies medicines according to levels of driving impairment
risk: respondents’ intentions to change their driving behav-
iour increased with higher categories of risk [18].
However, no study investigated the effect of a picto-
gram system regarding the impact on exposure and on
crash risk. If such an intervention had a measurable im-
pact, we would expect a decrease in overall use, as well as
a decrease in association with crash risk because of more
appropriate drug use.

 The aim of this study was therefore to assess potential
change in exposure and association with the risk of road
traffic crash across a time period that started before the imple-
mentation of the grading system.
Methods
We extracted and matched data from three French nation-
wide databases: the national healthcare insurance database
(HCI), police reports (PRs) and the police national database
of injurious crashes (ICs). Drivers were included by means
of their national healthcare ID number (NID), extracted from
PRs by an automatic procedure. PRs were matched to records
in the IC database by a probabilistic linkage method [16]
(Figure 2). Responsibility in the crash was determined in or-
der to conduct a case–control study in which responsible
drivers were cases and non-responsible drivers were controls.
The NID was used to link drivers to medicine reimbursement
data around the crash date. Exposure to benzodiazepines and
z-hypnotics was estimated from dispensing dates.
Ethics statement
Confidentiality was ensured by using the personal informa-
tion anonymization function of the HCI system [19]. The
study was approved by the French Data Protection Authority.
Data sources
Police reports (PRs).
French police forces are required to fill
out a PR for each injurious crash occurring in the country
(about 70 000 reports each year). PRs are scanned and stored
as image files. For some of the drivers involved in these
injurious road traffic crashes, the NID is recorded in the PR.
A previous validation study showed that the NID was
recorded for 28% of the drivers involved [16]. These NIDs
were extracted from PR image files for later matching
against dispensing records in the HCI database. All PRs
available over the study period (from July 2005 to December
2011) were compiled. No specific validation and cleaning
procedure
is
performed
on
PRs.
However,
NIDs
were
checked for validity using the last two digits which form a
control key.
National police database of injurious crashes (IC database).
Police data are transmitted, checked for consistency and
completed for missing information according to a real-time
process that leads to a final database on average one year
after the event. All information about the crash, vehicles
and persons involved are stored in this database. Police
personnel also conduct investigations from hospital records
about the severity of the driver’s injuries: unhurt, slightly
injured, and seriously injured (hospitalized >24 h), or killed
(died within 30 days following the crash). All drivers
involved in an injurious road traffic crash must be tested for
the presence of alcohol, using a breath test. If this test is
positive (≥0.5 g l�1), or the driver refuses the test, or the
severity of the crash makes it impossible to administer the
test,
then
the
driver’s
blood
alcohol
concentration
is
measured. If the breath test is negative, the driver is
recorded as not being under the influence of alcohol.

ber of records in the national police database of injurious crashes is explained by the fact that a small proportion of unavailable reports were being
used for ongoing legal investigations. Note that the control group was available for period 3 and period 4 only

 National healthcare insurance database (HCI database).
The
HCI database covers the entire population of France. A
record
is
added
each
time
a
reimbursed
prescription
medicine is dispensed to an outpatient at a pharmacy,
including national ID number, date of dispensing and the
seven-digit code that identifies medicines. Data on long-
term chronic diseases are also recorded in this database,
together with the ICD-10 code (International Classification
of Diseases, Tenth Revision) as well as the start and end
dates of the disease. In France, patients are fully reimbursed
for healthcare expenses related to 30 recognized long-term
chronic diseases. HCI database quality is insured by the
national
healthcare
insurance
system.
Its
accuracy
is
required as the whole health reimbursement system relies
on these data.
Participant inclusion
A driver was excluded if the police report did not contain his
or her national ID or if the extraction procedure failed or a
link could not be established with the corresponding record
in the national police database of injurious crashes. If a driver
was involved in several crashes during the study period, only
the first crash was considered, to ensure that the dispensing
of a drug was not a consequence of a previous crash.
Medicines and exposure periods
Medication exposure was considered to start on the day
following dispensing. To ensure that medicines were not
prescribed as a consequence of the crash, medicines dis-
pensed on the crash day were not considered.
Exposure duration was estimated from median values re-
ported in a survey on medicine prescription in France [20].
This
survey
was
conducted
among
800
practitioners,
representative of French physicians, three times a year, over
a 7-day period, during which all prescriptions were collected.
Benzodiazepines and z-hypnotics.
The medicines of interest
were classified into three groups: benzodiazepine anxiolytics
(level 2 and level 3), benzodiazepine hypnotics (level 3) and
z-hypnotics (level 3).
Concomitant medicine exposure.
Comparisons were adjusted
for the use of other medicines as classified in the highest
levels of risk for driving (levels 2 and 3). This includes
antiepileptics, psycholeptics, antidepressants and analgesic
opioids.
Time periods
Before 2005, a single pictogram was printed on the packaging
of almost one in three medicines and these medicines were
very heterogeneous regarding their impact on the risk of
crash. In 2003, the European Medicines Agency requested
the standardized classification of medicines according to four
levels of driving impairment risk, from level 0 (no or negligi-
ble risk) to level 3 (major risk). At this time, the therapeutic
classes that were most likely to affect driving ability were in-
vestigated by an ad-hoc committee coordinated by the
French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products
Safety (then known as the French Health Products Safety
Agency) according to their pharmacodynamic and kinetic
effects, individual sensitivity, the conditions of use of each
medicine, pharmacovigilance data, and experimental and
crash study data when available. These medicines included
benzodiazepines and z-hypnotics and most of them were
classified as risk level 2 or 3. In August 2005, the list of these
medicines and their corresponding pictograms were pub-
lished as an official regulation [21] and pharmaceutical com-
panies had to comply with it and print the new pictograms
during the following year. In 2008, the same committee met
a second time to investigate medicines of lower priority, most
of which were classified as risk level 1 (Figure 1) [22].
The study period was thus divided into four time
periods. July 2005–December 2006 corresponded to a period
during which the colour-graded three-level pictogram was
not yet set up. The following period (January 2007–May
2008) was used to estimate the impact of the introduction
of the three-level pictogram. The last two time periods
(June 2008–December 2009 and January 2010–December
2011) were defined to assess any relapse in the potential
impact of the pictogram.
Determining crash responsibility
Crash responsibility was determined by a standardized
method adapted from Robertson and Drummer [23]. This
method, which was already validated in France using data
from the national police database of fatal crashes [24], takes
into consideration the different factors likely to reduce driver
responsibility: road, vehicle and driving conditions, type of
accident, traffic rule obedience and difficulty of the task
involved. A score is assigned to each driver for each of these
factors from 1 (favourable to driving) to 4 (not favourable to
driving). The higher the sum of the scores, the less favourable
the driving conditions, and consequently the more likely the
driver will be considered not responsible for the crash.
Drivers were further grouped into two levels of crash
responsibility: responsible (score <15) or non-responsible
(score ≥15).
Control group: individuals from the general
population
To estimate the level of exposure, a control group was ran-
domly built from the entire HCI database. The sample of con-
trols was built to have the same distribution of gender and age
as included drivers (cases). Cases and controls were thus
matched for these two variables. An index date equal to the
matched case’s crash date was attributed to each control
and medicine exposure was estimated around this date. The
control sample therefore comprised individuals from the gen-
eral population, not selected as being involved in a road traf-
fic crash. It is, however, possible that a very small proportion
of them were indeed involved in a crash during the study
period. This sample was only available in the last two time
periods of the study because data from earlier periods had
already been archived.
Statistical analysis
Data were analysed using the SAS® statistical software pack-
age, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Responsibility
analysis.
A
responsibility
analysis
was
performed to compare exposure probabilities on the day of
the crash between responsible drivers (cases) and non-
responsible drivers (controls). This method is not able to
assess the effect of transient exposure, but is useful in
shedding light on possible more long-term differential risks
associated with medicine use. The associations between
responsibility and age, gender, socioeconomic category,
month, day of the week, time of day, location, vehicle type,
alcohol level, injury severity, long-term chronic diseases and
other
level
2
and
level
3
medicines
were
initially
investigated using bivariate analysis. Data were missing
only for alcohol level. Sensitivity analyses were performed
in the bivariate analysis, excluding individuals with missing
values, to investigate potential changes in ORs. Variables
were included in the multivariate model when the P-value
was less than 20% (chi-squared test), if they were known in
the literature as risk factors or if they were potential
confounders. Drivers with missing data were excluded from
the multivariate analysis. Parameters were estimated using
logistic regression. We tested the interactions between
exposure and each of the adjustment variables.
Results
The results of the overall extraction and matching proce-
dures are illustrated in Figure 2. National IDs, gender and
date of birth were extracted from 439 518 available PRs cor-
responding to any individual involved in an injurious road
traffic
crash.
Approximately
90%
of
these
individuals
(186 636) were matched with a corresponding record in the
IC database. The linkage failed for the IDs corresponding ei-
ther to a driver involved in the crash but not captured in the
IC database, or to an individual not involved in the crash
(e.g., a witness, the owner of a vehicle involved). Almost
17% (142 763) of the drivers registered in the IC database
were included. The inclusion rate was slightly lower for
responsible drivers than for non-responsible drivers. Injury
severity was the main factor associated with the probability
of being part of the study (data not shown). Multivariate
analysis was therefore adjusted for this variable to consider
this potential selection bias.
Among the 142 763 included drivers, 40 657 were in-
volved in a crash during period 1, 32 028 during period 2,
33 395 during period 3, and 36 683 during period 4. Drivers
were slightly older in period 4, which explains the higher
rates of retirees and chronic diseases in this period. The per-
centages of unhurt drivers were higher in periods 3 and 4
(Table 1). The information on alcohol level was missing for
18 533 drivers (13%). Excluding these individuals from the
bivariate analysis led to no significant change in estimated
ORs. Exposure to benzodiazepines and z-hypnotics was
higher among women and drivers over 45 years of age. There
was also an association between exposure to these medicines
and driving under the influence of alcohol, and they were
more frequent in users of other level 2 and level 3 medicines
than in non-users (data not shown).
For all study periods, the prevalence of exposure to benzo-
diazepine anxiolytics was higher among responsible drivers
than among non-responsible drivers and controls (Figure 3).
Exposure to benzodiazepine anxiolytics was associated with
an increased risk of being responsible for a road traffic crash
during period 1. This association disappeared in period 2
and became significant again during periods 3 and 4. The
trend was similar for benzodiazepine hypnotics, but low over-
all exposure levels led to insignificant figures (Figure 4).
Levels of exposure to z-hypnotics increased slightly in
period 4, both among responsible drivers and controls, and
a significant association with responsibility was found in
periods 2, 3 and 4. A significant decrease in exposure to
z-hpnotics was observed in non-responsible drivers after
period 1 (Figure 5).
Responsibility comparisons were adjusted for variables
found to be associated with responsibility for the crash (age,
gender, socioeconomic category, month, day of the week,
time of day, location, vehicle type, alcohol level, injury sever-
ity, chronic disease) and for exposure to other level 2 and level
3 medicines. There was no interaction of medicine use with
alcohol consumption or with the other adjustment variables.
Discussion
We assessed the impact of the coloured pictogram labelling of
medicine packages on the risk of road traffic crash associated
with use of benzodiazepines and z-hypnotics. The high level
of exposure to the medicines of interest among responsible
drivers during the fourth period, combined with an associa-
tion with risk of responsibility, results in an increased fraction
of road crashes attributable to these medicines in France.
The risk of responsibility associated with benzodiazepine
anxiolytics decreased immediately after the introduction of
the three-level pictogram, but increased again over time.
Among responsible drivers, exposure to benzodiazepine anxi-
olytics tended to decrease after the pictogram implementa-
tion and to increase in the last period, while it remained
stable among non-responsible drivers. These trends might
be explained by a transient effect of the colour-graded
pictogram. Even if we have no complementary data sources
to confirm this hypothesis, one can conclude that our data

 are not consistent with a sustainable impact of the new sys-
tem. This could stem from attrition in information provided
to patients by healthcare professionals, from less safe driving
or from less appropriate medicine use.
The risk of being responsible for a crash gradually in-
creased in users of z-hypnotics across the study periods. There
was
a
significant
decrease
of
z-hypnotic
exposure
in
non-responsible drivers after the implementation of the
three-level pictogram, but such a trend was not observed in
responsible drivers. Z-hypnotics were graded 3 in the new
system. Use of these medicines was found to be associated
with crash responsibility. As already noted in a previous
study, these results may reflect overall riskier behaviour of
drivers using these medicines, in particular for those with
abusive or recreational use [10]. This interpretation is consis-
tent with the observation that the significant responsibility
odds ratios in periods 2–4 are mainly explained by a reduc-
tion in z-hypnotic use among non-responsible drivers. In a
study comparing the effectiveness of two pictogram systems,
the authors showed that a labelling system with no frame of
reference related to other levels of risk can lead to underesti-
mation of the hazard of drugs with the highest risk levels
[18]. This may thus have been the case for z-hypnotics, which
are all classified as level 3. A similar increase in exposure
among controls suggests, however, that the problem may be
more related to overall change in medicine use than to road
safety. This hypothesis is confirmed by a recent report which
showed that z-hypnotic use in France has been increasing
since 2010 [25].
In France, the duration of a hypnotic prescription
should not exceed four weeks and is non-renewable. In
elderly
patients,
molecules
with
short
half-lives
are
recommended. However, a recent report on benzodiazepine
consumption showed that the duration of use of benzodi-
azepine hypnotics is approximately four months a year
and is even higher in the elderly. For anxiolytics, the max-
imum duration of prescription is 12 weeks and the annual
time of use is around 5 months [25]. The recommendations
are thus now followed and inappropriate use is more im-
portant for hypnotics.
Pharmaceutical companies had one full year to comply
with the new regulation published in July 2005, allowing
them to change packaging and exhaust stocks of unlabelled
products. In practice, new packaging proved to still be rare
one year later (in July 2006). Consequently, we conservatively
ended the pre-intervention period in December 2006.

 Medicine exposure was ascertained from computerized
records of reimbursed prescriptions filled at the pharmacy.
These data were not subject to underreporting, a major
problem encountered when medicine exposure data are self-
reported [26]. However, we did not know whether the
medicines were actually ingested or not. Non-compliance
would result in exposure misclassification. There is, however,
no reason to think that compliance could be different accord-
ing to responsibility status; consequently, exposure misclassi-
fication would lead to underestimation of risk estimates.
Injury severity was associated with the probability of be-
ing part of the study. Thus severely injured drivers were more
likely to be included than slightly injured drivers. Killed
drivers and uninjured drivers had even lower inclusion rates.
This finding can be explained by the fact that injured drivers
were more likely to be admitted to hospital, so their
healthcare number was more frequently noted in the police
report. Thus, our study sample slightly overrepresented
drivers injured in more severe crashes. As a consequence,
older drivers are probably overrepresented, as fatality and se-
verity have been shown to be significantly higher for older
road users [27].
The responsibility analysis is a real strength of the study as
cases and controls share some common characteristics: they
were all driving a vehicle and, for multiple vehicle crashes,
were on the road at the same time. This is not the case for con-
trols when they are selected from healthcare or driving
licence databases. Another option would be to select controls
on the side of the road. Only low sample sizes, however, are
achieved using this method and this may also lead to selec-
tion bias as participation is on a voluntary basis. The princi-
ple
of
the
responsibility
analysis
is
that
if
a
factor
contributes to road traffic crash causation, it is expected that
it would be overrepresented in the responsible drivers. In a
previous study on the impact of illegal drug use, using the
same police national database but limited to fatal crashes
[24], the same method used to determine responsibility was
approved by an independent expert evaluation of responsi-
bility. Importantly, responsibility levels were computed inde-
pendently of alcohol and illicit drug use because of their
potential interactions with medicine use. The method does
not, however, capture the risk, for non-responsible drivers,
of being unable to avoid a crash that may be linked to
medicine use. This would lead to an underestimation of the
risk estimate. This proved to be a likely scenario as matched
controls
randomly
selected
from
the
national
health
insurance system and available for periods 3 and 4 exhibited
a consistently lower exposure level than the driver sample
(even when non-responsible).
Available national databases on crashes and medicine use
enabled us to monitor the pattern of exposure and risk among
drivers involved in injurious crashes in France over a six-and-
a-half-year period. There is general consensus in Europe on
the grading of the risk of medications [28] and the fact that

 the implementation of the three-level pictogram had no ob-
servable impact does not undermine the relevance of the in-
formation it provides. In our study, exposure to medicines
that are not labelled with a pictogram was associated with a
lower probability of crash responsibility and this effect was
stable over time, emphasizing the relevance of the French
classification system. However, our results question the effi-
cacy of the measures implemented to promote use and aware-
ness. The public campaign about these new pictograms was
mainly relayed by community pharmacies. A document was
disseminated to pharmacists, explaining how to approach
the problem with the patient [29] and a flyer was available
for patients [30]. However, resources for the distribution were
very limited. Relapses are commonly observed in road injury
prevention, for example following speed or drink and drive
enforcement. The use of medicines that impair driving is a
quantitatively less important risk factor with much lower
awareness (we estimated that around 3% of road traffic
crashes are attributable to medicinal drug use [16]). However,
this factor is preventable and this is why French policy
makers were interested in: firstly, evaluating the relevance of
the classification of medicines according to their impact on
driving abilities, and secondly evaluating the efficiency of
the warning system on these risks. A previous study answered
the first objective [16] and the present study stresses that pre-
vention policies relating to the general driving population,
but also to healthcare professionals including general practi-
tioners and pharmacists, should be reviewed. Long-term edu-
cational measures should be preferred and should specifically
target benzodiazepines and related drugs, as these account for
the largest share of the attributable fraction. This study is the
first to evaluate the impact of such pictograms on the risk for
traffic safety. Further research should be conducted at the
European level to compare the impact of different labelling
systems and to evaluate the most effective strategies to com-
municate a risk message.
