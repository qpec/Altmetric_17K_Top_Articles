OBJECTIVES: To examine, in a large, nationally representative sample of high school students, 
the association between bullying victimization and carrying weapons to school and 
to determine to what extent past experience of 1, 2, or 3 additional indicators of peer 
aggression increases the likelihood of weapon carrying by victims of bullying (VoBs).
METHODS: National data from the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey were analyzed for grades 
9 to 12 (N = 15 624). VoB groups were determined by self-report of being bullied at school 
and additional adverse experiences: fighting at school, being threatened or injured at 
school, and skipping school out of fear for one’s safety. Weapon carrying was measured 
by a dichotomized (ie, ≥1 vs 0) report of carrying a gun, knife, or club on school property. 
VoB groups were compared with nonvictims with respect to weapon carrying by logistic 
regression adjusting for sex, grade, and race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: When surveyed, 20.2% of students reported being a VoB in the past year, and 
4.1% reported carrying a weapon to school in the past month. VoBs experiencing 1, 2, or 3 
additional risk factors were successively more likely to carry weapons to school. The subset 
of VoBs who experienced all 3 additional adverse experiences were more likely to carry 
weapons to school compared with nonvictims (46.4% vs 2.5%, P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Pediatricians should recognize that VoBs, especially those who have 
experienced 1 or more indicators of peer aggression in conjunction, are at substantially 
increased risk of weapon carrying.

 The issue of school violence 
continues to pose a serious threat 
to the well-being of children and 
adolescents. In 2015 alone, there 
were 45 reported school shootings 
in the United States.1 In the wake 
of Columbine and other cases of 
targeted school violence, there has 
been increased recognition of the risk 
of retaliatory violence by students 
who have been victims of bullying 
(VoBs).
Bullying is characterized by the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) as “any unwanted 
aggressive behavior(s) by another 
youth or group of youths who 
are not siblings or current dating 
partners that involves an observed 
or perceived power imbalance and 
is repeated multiple times or is 
highly likely to be repeated.” 
2 It has 
been well established that VoBs are 
at increased risk of experiencing 
negative physical, mental health, and 
academic issues that may persist for 
years after the bullying incident(s).3 
– 
7 
VoBs also exhibit higher levels of 
violent behaviors compared with 
nonvictims.8, 
 
9 Previously, researchers 
have documented that bullying 
victimization is associated with 
greater odds of weapon carrying, 
9– 
11 
and in a robust meta-analysis of 22 
studies, researchers recently found 
that VoBs were approximately twice 
as likely to carry weapons compared 
with uninvolved peers.12
Although it has been well established 
that VoBs are more likely to carry 
weapons, not all victims carry 
weapons to school. Our purpose with 
this study is to identify factors that 
predict which VoBs are more likely 
to carry weapons compared with 
other victims. In addition to bullying 
victimization, several risk factors 
associated with being a VoB (such 
as feeling unsafe at school or on the 
way to and from school, 
13, 
 
14 being 
threatened with a weapon, 
13, 
 
15– 
17 
and being in a physical fight18) have 
also been associated with weapon 
carrying. Thus, we hypothesize that 
the prevalence of weapon carrying 
increases among VoBs who have 
experienced successively greater 
numbers of risk factors. If so, then 
these additional indicators of peer 
aggression may serve as red flags 
for VoBs who may be most likely 
to carry weapons to school. Given 
that many perpetrators of targeted 
school violence had previously been 
bullied, 
19 it is important to investigate 
behavioral indicators that may 
amplify the risk of weapon carrying 
at school by a VoB and thus serve as 
useful markers for the most at-risk 
victims.
To date, there is no study in which 
researchers have assessed the degree 
to which multiple compounded 
risk factors (specifically, fighting at 
school, being threatened or injured 
at school, and skipping school out 
of fear for one’s safety) increase 
the likelihood that a VoB will carry 
a weapon to school. Although these 
correlates of weapon carrying 
have been studied separately, their 
associations with weapon carrying 
(alone or in combination) specifically 
among VoBs have not been 
examined. By using a large, nationally 
representative sample of high school 
students and applying adjustments 
for relevant demographic factors, in 
the present investigation, we aim (1) 
to examine the association between 
being a VoB and carrying weapons to 
school and (2) to determine to what 
extent 1, 2, or 3 additional indicators 
of peer aggression increase the 
likelihood of weapon carrying by a 
VoB.
MEthODS
The national Youth Risk Behavior 
Survey (YRBS) uses a 3-stage cluster 
sample design to obtain a nationally 
representative sample of US high 
school students. Responses were 
weighted for nonresponses and for 
oversampling of African American 
and Hispanic students. The detailed 
methodology and national data sets 
are available at the CDC Web site.20 
In this study, data from the 2015 
National YRBS were analyzed for 
grades 9 to 12.
Exposures
Victimization groups were based on 
responses to 4 self-report questions. 
Designation of “victims of bullying” 
and “nonvictims” was measured by 
responses to the question, “Bullying 
is when 1 or more students tease, 
threaten, spread rumors about, hit, 
shove, or hurt another student over 
and over again. It is not bullying 
when 2 students of approximately 
the same strength or power argue or 
fight or tease each other in a friendly 
way. During the past 12 months, 
have you ever been bullied on 
school property?” Three additional 
risk factors that have been shown 
in the literature to be associated 
with bullying victimization were 
analyzed: “During the past 30 days, 
on how many days did you not go to 
school because you felt you would be 
unsafe at school or on your way to or 
from school?”, “During the past 12 
months, how many times were you in 
a physical fight on school property?”, 
and “During the past 12 months, how 
many times has someone threatened 
or injured you with a weapon such 
as a gun, knife, or club on school 
property?” These responses were 
dichotomized (0 vs ≥1 instances) and 
designated as “felt unsafe, skipped 
school, 
” “involved in fights at school, 
” 
and “threatened or injured at  
school.”
By using responses to these 4 
variables, 8 subsets of the VoBs 
were created: students who were 
bullied and experienced none (1 
group), exactly 1 (3 groups), exactly 
2 (3 groups), and all 3 additional 
risk factors (1 group). Thus, these 
victimization groups successively 
hone in on the students hypothesized 
to be at greatest risk for weapon 
carrying.
The 8 victimization groups were 
compared with the nonvictims

 reference group: students who 
did not report being bullied in the 
past year and did not experience 
additional risk factors.
Outcomes
Weapon carrying at school was 
measured by the self-report question, 
“During the past 30 days, on how 
many days did you carry a weapon 
such as a gun, knife, or club on school 
property?” Because of small cell 
sizes, frequency responses were 
dichotomized (0 vs ≥1 instances) and 
designated as “carried weapon to 
school” and “did not carry weapon to 
school.”
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were performed by using 
the “survey” package in R 3.2.2 with 
procedures specifically suited for 
survey data. Categorical comparisons 
across groups yielded P values based 
on the second-order Rao-Scott χ2 test, 
a modified version of the Pearson 
χ2 test that accounts for complex 
sampling design. Logistic regression 
comparing prevalence of weapon 
carrying across victim groups yielded 
adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) with 
adjustment for sex, grade, and the 8 
YRBS race/ethnicity groups: white, 
African American, Hispanic or Latino, 
multiracial and Hispanic, multiracial 
and non-Hispanic, Asian American, 
Native Hawaiian or other Pacific 
Islander, and American Indian or 
Alaska Native. Although adjustments 
to our analyses used the 8 YRBS 
race/ethnicity groups, top-level 
prevalence data were presented with 
respect to 4 consolidated categories: 
white, Hispanic or Latino (includes 
multiracial and Hispanic), African 
American, and other race.
To explore whether missing data 
could be a confounding factor, Rao-
Scott χ2 tests were conducted to 
determine if there was an association 
between missing data and being a 
VoB or weapon carrying. The 972 
(weighted) instances of missing data 
were not significantly associated with 
either of these variables. Thus, the 
main associations examined in this 
study are not likely to be confounded 
by these missing responses, and 
only nonmissing responses were 
included in calculations of prevalence 
and logistic analyses. All results 
presented are based on analyses 
of weighted data. Results were 
considered significant at the P < .05 
level.
RESULtS
The 2015 National YRBS achieved 
a school response rate of 69% and 
a student response rate of 86% 
(after data editing), yielding a final 
sample size of 15 624 and an overall 
response rate of 60%. By sex, 48.7% 
were girls and 51.3% were boys. 
By grade level, 27.2% were in ninth 
grade, 25.7% were in 10th grade, 
24.0% were in 11th grade, and 
23.1% were in 12th grade. By race/
ethnicity, the sample was 54.5% 
white, 22.3% Hispanic or Latino, 
13.6% African American, and 9.7% 
other race.
Prevalence of Exposures and 
Outcomes
 
Table 1 shows the prevalence, 95% 
CIs, and test statistics for “victims of 
bullying, 
” “physical fighting at school, 
”  
“felt unsafe, skipped school, 
” and 
“threatened or injured at school” 
across sex, grade, and race/ethnicity.
Approximately 4.1% of high school 
students reported carrying a weapon 
to school in the past month. The 
prevalence of weapon carrying was 
higher among boys than girls (5.9% 
vs 2.0%, P < .001).

 Associations between Vobs and 
Additional Risk Factors
VoBs were more likely to skip school 
(aOR: 4.55; 95% CI: 3.77–5.48), to 
have been threatened or injured 
at school (aOR: 5.27; 95% CI: 
4.34–6.39), and to have been in a 
fight at school (aOR: 2.56; 95% CI: 
1.98–3.31).
Associations between Weapon 
Carrying and Additional Risk Factors
Students who reported skipping 
school because they felt unsafe at 
school or on the way to school were 
more likely to carry weapons to 
school than those who didn’t (aOR: 
4.51; 95% CI: 3.25–6.25). Students 
who were involved in school fights 
were more likely to carry weapons 
than uninvolved students (aOR: 6.50; 
95% CI: 4.46–9.46). Finally, students 
who had been threatened or injured 
at school were more likely to carry 
weapons compared with those who 
had not been threatened or injured 
(aOR: 8.72; 95% CI: 6.22–12.22).
Associations between Weapon 
Carrying and Victimization Groups
 
Table 2 shows the percentage of 
students within each victimization 
group subset who carried a weapon 
to school as well as the aORs and 
95% CIs of each victimization group 
compared with the reference group 
of nonvictims who did not experience 
additional risk factors.
Overall, VoBs were more likely to 
carry weapons to school compared 
with nonvictims (aOR: 2.25; 95% CI: 
1.72–2.96). However, as shown in 
 
Table 2, VoBs who did not report any 
of the 3 additional risk factors were 
not more likely to carry weapons 
than nonvictims. When the impacts of 
additional risk factors were analyzed 
individually, the odds of weapon 
carrying by VoBs who reported 
skipping school out of fear for their 
safety, physical fighting at school, 
or being threatened or injured at 
school were, respectively, 3.09, 5.02, 
and 5.94 times greater compared

reported skipping school out of fear 
for their safety, the aORs were 5.86 
and 6.90, respectively, if they also 
reported being threatened or injured 
at school or reported fighting at 
school. Among victims who reported 
being threatened or injured at 
school, the aOR was 14.45 if they also 
reported fighting at school. Students 
in the subset of victims who reported 
all 3 risk factors were much more

DISCUSSION
Although previous researchers have 
established an association between 
bullying victimization and risk of 
weapon carrying, 
10 
– 
12 with this 
study, we are the first to examine 
the compounded risk of weapon 
carrying among VoBs who have also 
experienced other risk factors. In 
this large, nationally representative 
sample of US high school students, 1 
in 5 teenagers reported that they had 
been bullied in the past year. VoBs 
were over twice as likely to carry 
weapons to school compared with 
nonvictims. With over 16 million 
high school students in the United 
States, 
22 in our analyses of CDC data, 
we suggest that >200 000 VoBs had 
carried a weapon to school in the 30 
days before taking the survey.
By successively honing in on the 
students hypothesized to be at 
greatest risk for weapon carrying, we 
showed a clear pattern of increased 
prevalence of weapon carrying 
among the subsets of victims who 
experienced additional risk factors, 
such as fighting at school, being 
threatened or injured at school, and 
skipping school out of fear for their 
safety. Although VoBs with none of 
the 3 additional risk factors were 
not more likely to carry weapons to 
school compared with nonvictims 
(2.8% vs 2.5%, P = .2), the prevalence 
of weapon carrying rose to 5.3% 
to 11.9% among victims with 1 
additional risk factor, 9.7% to 25.9% 
among those with 2 additional risk 
factors, and a staggering 46.4% 
among victims who had skipped 
school, were threatened or injured 
at school, and had been in a fight 
at school. Students whose sense 
of safety had been violated or 
threatened in successively more 
ways had a greater propensity 
to carry weapons to school, with 
each additional risk factor further 
compounding this risk.
The current study adds to the 
robust body of research showing 
the respective impacts of feeling 
unsafe at school or on the way to and 
from school, 
13, 
 
14 being threatened 
with a weapon, 
13, 
 
15– 
17 and being in 
a physical fight.18 By evaluating the 
impact of these adverse experiences 
singly and in combination, we 
demonstrate the additive risk of 
experiencing multiple risk factors. By 
focusing on these effects among VoBs, 
we draw attention to an especially 
complicated student population that 
has been shown to be at greater risk 
of weapon carrying.9

Split-Sex Analysis
The odds ratio trends noted in the 
total sample were likewise present 
when boys and girls were analyzed 
separately. Although the percentage 
of girls who carried weapons was 
generally lower than the percentage 
of boys who carried weapons, the 
aORs were typically higher among 
girls compared with boys due in part 
to the low rate of weapon carrying 
among girls in the reference group 
and in part to the elevated rates 
of weapon carrying among girls 
experiencing multiple additional 
risk factors. Thus, despite generally 
higher rates of weapon carrying by 
boys, the sex discrepancy seemed 
to narrow among the victimization 
groups exhibiting several additional 
risk factors; among these high-risk 
groups, girls who were bullied 
carried weapons at rates that 
approached those of boys who were 
bullied. Although researchers have 
repeatedly documented higher 
rates of violence19, 
 
23 and weapon 
carrying13, 
 
24, 
25 among boys, with 
our data we strongly suggest that 
the potential for weapon carrying by 
girls, especially those who have been 
victimized in 1 or more ways, should 
not be discounted.
Study Limitations
Despite the advantages offered by 
large, nationally-representative 
data, analysis of cross-sectional data 
cannot establish causal relationships 
or ascertain the timing of events 
(whether bullying or weapon 
carrying came first). However, as 
bullying victimization was assessed 
by past-year figures and weapon 
carrying was assessed by past-month 
figures, it is much more likely than 
not that a bullying incident preceded 
weapon carrying.
The issue of self-report also poses 
several limitations. As students may 
be reluctant to admit to weapon 
carrying, our prevalence figures are 
likely underestimates. The survey 
methodology may also be susceptible 
to common method biases.
The scope and wording of questions 
asked in the YRBS limited the 
variables that we could include in our 
analyses and our ability to accurately 
interpret their results. First, given 
the different time frames of the YRBS 
questions (past month versus past 
year), these analyses cannot account 
for students who were bullied in 
the past year and indeed carried a 
weapon to school but not within the 
past-month time frame captured 
by the survey. Second, previous 
researchers have shown that some 
VoBs are themselves bullies to others 
(“bully-victims”).26,

hodges EV, Perry DG. Victims of peer 
abuse: an overview. Reclaiming 
information regarding each student’s 
own bullying behaviors, our analyses 
could not distinguish between those 
who are victim-only and those who 
are bully-victims. Third, the exposure 
variable “involved in fights at school” 
did not allow for a more granular 
analysis distinguishing perpetrators 
of fights from victims of fighting. 
Although “fighting” is less clearly 
an indicator of victimization, our 
analyses show that it is nonetheless 
a risk factor for weapon carrying and 
would thus be a pertinent screening 
question. Thus, these results do 
not reveal whether weapons were 
brought to school for defensive, self-
protection purposes or for offensive 
purposes relating to aggression, 
intimidation, or retribution.
Because of small cell sizes, the split-
sex analyses, although interesting 
from a macro perspective, could not 
more robustly and directly compare 
high-risk male and high-risk female 
students. Similarly, small cell sizes did 
not allow for more granular analysis of 
weapon carrying type and frequency 
(ie, gun versus other weapons, number 
of times per month).
Implications for Pediatricians, 
Parents, and School Personnel
Violence-prevention efforts should 
consider directing what limited 
resources are available toward 
students who are at greatest risk 
for weapon carrying. We highlight 
3 risk factors that greatly amplify 
the odds of weapon carrying by 
VoBs. When caring for students 
who have been bullied in school, 
pediatricians, parents, and school 
personnel should also be vigilant for 
risk factors such as fighting at school, 
being threatened or injured at school, 
and/or skipping school out of fear 
for their safety. Parents and school 
personnel should be watchful for red 
flags such as unexplained bruises or 
injuries, school avoidance, and/or 
frequent truancy.
In 2009, the American Academy of 
Pediatrics issued a policy statement 
urging pediatricians to familiarize 
themselves with the “Connected 
Kids: Safe, Strong, Secure” primary 
care violence prevention protocol28 
and to practice anticipatory guidance, 
screening, and counseling of children 
and families.29 This policy statement 
emphasizes that youth exhibiting 
violence-related behaviors should 
be treated and/or referred to the 
appropriate medical and community-
based resources in a timely manner. 
Given the widespread prevalence 
of self-reported bullying, additional 
screening questions may help to 
identify youth who are most likely 
to carry weapons among the 20.2% 
of youth who report being a VoB. 
Pediatricians may also play a role in 
violence prevention by participating 
in advocacy for community-based 
behavioral health services, educating 
themselves about resources 
for children and adolescents 
with violence-related problems, 
and contributing to research in 
the domain of youth violence 
prevention.29
CONCLUSIONS
Bullying is widespread among 
high school students in the United 
States. Furthermore, the alarming 
percentage of students who carry 
weapons on school property signals 
that school campuses are still not the 
optimal, safe learning environments 
that we want for our youth. The 
risk of weapon carrying by VoBs 
progressively increases among 
students who have experienced 1 
or more risk factors in conjunction 
with bullying. Pediatricians should 
familiarize themselves with youth 
violence protocols and screen for risk 
factors for weapon carrying during 
routine consults, paying particular 
attention to VoBs who report fighting 
at school, being threatened or injured 
at school, or skipping school out of 
fear for their safety.
