Abstract
Objective—Our objective was to determine the rate of mucosal recovery in pediatric patients 
with celiac disease on a gluten free diet. We also sought to determine whether IgA tissue 
transglutaminase (tTG) correlates with mucosal damage at the time of a repeat endoscopy with 
duodenal biopsy in these patients.
Methods—We performed a retrospective chart review of one-hundred and three pediatric 
patients, under 21 years of age, with a diagnosis of celiac disease defined as Marsh 3 histology, 
and who underwent a repeat endoscopy with duodenal biopsy at least twelve months after 
initiating a gluten free diet.
Results—We found that 19% of pediatric patients treated with a gluten free diet had persistent 
enteropathy. At the time of the repeat biopsy, tTG was elevated in 43% of cases with persistent 
enteropathy and 32% of cases in which there was mucosal recovery. Overall the positive predictive 
value of the autoantibody tissue transglutaminase was 25% and the negative predictive value was 
83% in patients on a gluten free diet for a median of 2.4 years.

 Conclusions—Nearly one in five children with celiac disease in our population had persistent 
enteropathy despite maintaining a gluten free diet and IgA tTG was not an accurate marker of 
mucosal recovery. Neither the presence of symptoms nor positive serology were predictive of a 
patient’s histology at the time of repeat biopsy. These findings suggest a revisitation of monitoring 
and management criteria of celiac disease in childhood.

Introduction
Not long ago celiac disease (CD) was described as a childhood illness characterized by 
presentation with gastrointestinal symptoms, irritability, and poor growth (1). The 
development of a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic test for CD, the immunoglobulin A 
(IgA) tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG) serology test, has allowed for minimally-
invasive and cost-effective screening of at-risk individuals and groups (2). This has 
transformed our clinical appreciation of CD and how dietary adherence and mucosal 
recovery is monitored. Currently, children diagnosed with CD are followed in close 
collaboration with dietetic colleagues for counseling to educate and promote adherence to 
the gluten free diet (GFD). Growth and nutritional markers are monitored. In addition, 
current guidelines recommend follow-up serology both to assess dietary adherence and for 
use as a surrogate marker of mucosal recovery (3,4,5,6). In practice, antibody levels, usually 
the IgA tTG, are measured six months and then again one year after initiation of the GFD. 
When the level normalizes, it is presumed that mucosal recovery, attained through dietary 
adherence, has occurred. Adult patients with CD have similar follow-up with dietary 
counseling and the use of serologic markers. Studies evaluating mucosal healing in adults 
with CD on a GFD show that even after two years on a GFD, between one-third and two-
thirds of patients have persistent mucosal damage, consistent with Marsh 3 criteria, (7,8) 
irrespective of IgA tTG levels. Recent data evaluating pediatric mucosal recovery is scarce, 
however, early data has suggested a more complete and faster healing time in children 
compared to adults (9). While not corroborated by evidence, anecdotally this has been 
explained by a decreased regenerative capacity of the adult intestine, resulting in slow and 
incomplete healing.
While current guidelines endorse and recommend the use of serology as a marker of dietary 
adherence and mucosal recovery, these serology tests have not been validated for this 
purpose. Our objective was to determine the rate of mucosal recovery in the pediatric 
population and to evaluate whether tTG correlates with mucosal damage at the time of a 
repeat endoscopy with duodenal biopsy in children with CD on a GFD.
Methods
We performed a retrospective chart review at two hospitals and identified 103 pediatric 
patients who fulfilled our inclusion criteria described below. Study procedures were 
approved by the Partners Human Resource Committee (PHRC) and Institutional Review

 Boards (IRB) at MassGeneral Hospital for Children (MGHfC) and Boston Children’s 
Hospital (BCH).
Subjects
Data for patients seen between January 2012 and March 2015 were extracted from medical 
records at MGHfC. Patients were identified by ICD-9 code. Additional data were obtained 
for patients seen between January 2008 and December 2013 at BCH, identified using the 
BCH Celiac Database, a database of all children diagnosed with biopsy proven CD at that 
institution. 61 patients were identified at MGHfC and 42 patients were identified at BCH.
Inclusion Criteria
To be included in the study, patients were required to be 21 years or younger at the time of 
diagnosis of CD, must have had diagnostic endoscopy with Marsh 3 lesions, and have 
undergone a second endoscopy with duodenal biopsy at least twelve months after initiating a 
gluten free diet. All patients meeting these criteria were included in the study.
Setting
The Celiac Research Program at Harvard Medical School is a collaboration between Beth 
Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children’s Hospital, and MassGeneral Hospital for 
Children, all located in Boston, MA, USA. These three hospitals serve as quaternary care 
centers and referral centers for children and adults with CD and gluten-related disorders. 
Patients from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center were not included in this study.
Data collection
Data extracted from medical records included predominant clinical symptoms, serology 
tests, and duodenal histology at the time of the diagnostic and repeat endoscopy. Serology 
tests reviewed included immunoglobulin A (IgA) level, IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG), 
and anti-endomysial antibody (EMA) when available. Serological values collected within 
four months of the endoscopy were included in the analysis. We dichotomized serological 
values into positive/borderline or negative according to cut-off values defined by the 
laboratories which performed the tests. Mucosal changes were scored by more than one 
pathologist at each institution using the Marsh criteria as modified by Oberhuber (0 = 
normal; 1= increased intraepithelial lymphocytes [>25/100 epithelial cells], normal crypts 
and villi; 2 = increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, normal villi, crypt hyperplasia; 3 = 
increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia) (10,11). If 
endoscopic evaluation revealed multiple Marsh scores, the most severe was used.
For analysis, subjects were evaluated by the presence or absence of symptoms and length of 
time on a gluten free diet. We also recorded whether subjects received any dietetic 
counseling, defined as a nutrition consultation with a Registered Dietician, during the 
interval between the initial endoscopy and the follow-up endoscopy. We reviewed the 
physician’s and dietician’s notes commenting on the subjects adherence to the GFD at the 
clinic visit prior to the repeat endoscopy and scored adherence using criteria modified from 
Leffler et al: (1) Excellent = patient never eats gluten intentionally and/or has rare exposure, 
(2) Good = inadvertent exposure once per month, (3) poor = exposure 1–2 times per week,

 (4) noncompliant = not on a GFD, or (5) unable to assess GFD adherence from medical 
record (12).
Statistical Approach
Categorical data are presented as frequency (percentage) and group comparisons made with 
either the Pearson chi-squared statistic or Fisher’s exact test when the expected cell count 
was <5. Continuous data are described as mean±SD if normally distributed and median 
(interquartile range; IQR) otherwise. Most continuous outcomes were right-skewed and 
therefore group comparisons were made with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Two-group 
comparisons of normally distributed variables were evaluated by Student’s t-test. All tests of 
significance were two-sided with α = 0.05, and all analysis performed with SAS (Cary, NC).
Results
Subject Characteristics (Table 1)
At the time of data collection 103 subjects were identified for inclusion into the study. 
Subjects were 10.6±5.0 years of age at diagnosis and 60% were female. Consistent with the 
literature, tTG performed well at diagnosis with 89% of subjects with a positive IgA tTG. 
Eleven subjects had a negative tTG at diagnosis. Two subjects with a normal IgA tTG were 
asymptomatic at diagnosis. One of these subjects was IgA deficient, homozygous for DQ2, 
and had a family history of celiac disease. This patient underwent endoscopy to evaluate a 
gastric lesion and was found to have duodenal villous blunting. The second asymptomatic 
subject had a normal IgA tTG but an elevated IgA EMA and a family history of CD which 
prompted the endoscopy. The other nine patients had gastrointestinal complaints which 
prompted an evaluation by a gastroenterologist. Six out of nine individuals had HLA testing 
which confirmed genetic susceptibility for CD. One of these six patients had an elevated IgA 
EMA in the presence of a normal IgA tTG and one patient was IgA deficient. Of the three 
patients that had gastrointestinal complaints, normal IgA tTG, and no HLA testing, one 
patient had an elevated IgA EMA, one patient was under two years of age, and all three had 
improvement on a gluten free diet with subsequent resolution of villous atrophy upon repeat 
endoscopy.
Overall, the majority of subjects presented with gastrointestinal complaints such as 
abdominal pain and constipation. Approximately 14% of subjects were asymptomatic at 
diagnosis and identified via routine screening of high-risk populations. Additionally, 12% of 
subjects in our population had a comorbid autoimmune disease such as type 1 diabetes or 
thyroiditis. In line with the inclusion criteria, all subjects had intestinal enteropathy 
consistent with a Marsh 3 lesion at diagnosis.
Patient Characteristics at Repeat Biopsy (Table 2)
At the time of the repeat endoscopy, subjects had been following a GFD for a median of 2.4 
years (IQR 1.4–4.0) with a range of 1–12 years. In most cases, patients had more than one 
indication for a repeat endoscopy. The most common indications for repeat endoscopy were 
due to persistent symptoms (43%) and new gastrointestinal symptoms (27%). Twenty-four 
subjects (34%) had persistently elevated serology at the time of the repeat biopsy. The

 majority of subjects (91%) had excellent adherence to the GFD. One-hundred and one 
subjects (98%) saw a dietician. Only one subject had no record of seeing a dietician as the 
other subject had a sibling with CD and the family had previously seen a dietician. Thirty-
four subjects (33%) were asymptomatic at the time of the repeat endoscopy. Twelve 
asymptomatic patients underwent a repeat endoscopy for follow-up of another disease (1 
ulcer, 2 ulcerative colitis, 9 esophagitis). Eleven asymptomatic patients had a repeat 
endoscopy due to persistently elevated serology (two had both EOE and elevated serology). 
Four asymptomatic children underwent a repeat endoscopy to assess for mucosal recovery 
and confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease in the setting of seronegative CD. Finally seven 
asymptomatic patients underwent endoscopy to confirm that mucosal recovery was 
achieved. In total, 19% exhibited persistent enteropathy consistent with a Marsh 3 lesion at 
the time of the repeat endoscopy.
Predictive value of tTG in identifying Marsh 3 histology at repeat biopsy (Table 3)
In practice, IgA tTG was a poor predictor of Marsh 3 histology at repeat biopsy as 
sensitivity was 43%, specificity was 68%, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 25%, and 
the negative predictive value (NPV) was 83%. The poor predictability of IgA tTG was 
consistent regardless of whether subjects reported symptoms at the time of the repeat 
endoscopy or the duration of the GFD. Of note, repeat serology within 4 months of the 
repeat biopsy was available for 71 of the subjects. Subjects with serology obtained greater 
than 4 months from the time of the repeat biopsy were not included in this section of the 
analysis.
Concordance of IgA tTG with histology at repeat biopsy
At the time of the follow-up biopsy, tTG was elevated in 43% of subjects with persistent 
enteropathy and 32% of subjects with mucosal healing. The overall concordance of IgA tTG 
with histology at the time of the repeat biopsy is shown in table 4. These numbers are based 
on the 71 subjects that had an IgA tTG measured within 4 months of the repeat endoscopy.
Concordance of symptoms with histology at repeat scope (Table 5.)
We examined the concordance between symptoms and mucosal recovery in the entire cohort 
(n=103) strictly by the presence or absence of symptoms at the time of the repeat endoscopy. 
We found that the majority of patients with complaints that may be related to CD had 
mucosal recovery 84%) (Marsh 0–2). However, 45% of patients with persistent enteropathy 
were asymptomatic. Twenty-six percent of the 23 asymptomatic patients who underwent 
repeat endoscopy to follow-up another disease (12), to assess for mucosal recovery due to 
seronegativity at diagnosis (4), or to assess for mucosal recovery (7), had persistent 
enteropathy. Twenty-seven percent of the 11 asymptomatic patients who underwent repeat 
endoscopy due to an elevated tTG had persistent enteropathy.
Comparison of select characteristics by Marsh severity at repeat endoscopy
We found no significant characteristics predictive of persistent enteropathy. Sex, age at 
diagnosis, presence of a positive tTG within four months of the repeat endoscopy, and self-
reported adherence to a GFD were not significantly different in subjects with persistent

 enteropathy compared to those in remission. Additionally, there was no significant 
difference in frequency of persistent enteropathy when comparing subjects maintaining a 
GFD for more than two years compared to those maintaining a GFD for less than two years. 
Finally, there was no difference in Marsh severity between subjects that reported symptoms 
at the time of the repeat endoscopy compared to those who did not.
Discussion
Historically, making the diagnosis of CD required three phases and three biopsies (13). The 
current protocol, which requires only one biopsy, relies upon the assumption that the vast 
majority of children with CD experience complete mucosal recovery after one year of a 
GFD. (14,15). These guidelines, drafted over 25 years ago were based on clinical evidence. 
However, over the past several decades there has been a shift to an older age at onset of CD 
and milder enteropathy at diagnosis. These findings along with the transformation in clinical 
presentation from almost exclusively gastrointestinal symptoms to a more diverse, systemic 
presentation provide further evidence that pediatric CD has changed (16,17,18,19,20). 
Despite this, the need for a follow-up biopsy has not been revisited and the need for an 
initial biopsy to confirm the disease in pediatric patients has been questioned. Data from 
adult patients with CD suggest the persistence of enteropathy in more than 33% of patients 
on a GFD, irrespective of symptoms or positive serology (7,8). This persistent enteropathy in 
adults has been associated with an increased risk of lymphoma, low bone density, and 
fracture (21,22,23). To date there is no clear understanding of the risk of mortality. In 
children, the long-term consequences of suboptimal healing are also unclear. However, 
malabsorption and ongoing inflammation in children may have negative repercussions on 
physical and cognitive development.
In our population, 19% of pediatric patients on a GFD had persistent enteropathy despite 
treatment on a GFD for at least one year. Forty-five percent of patients with persistent 
enteropathy were asymptomatic at the time of the repeat endoscopy. The majority of 
asymptomatic patients with CD who underwent a repeat endoscopy did so to assess mucosal 
recovery due to a different gastrointestinal disorder (ulcer, EOE, UC) and duodenal biopsies 
were taken for completeness. Four patients with seronegative CD at diagnosis underwent a 
repeat endoscopy to confirm CD remission, 7 others were evaluated to confirm remission of 
CD and the remaining asymptomatic patients underwent a repeat endoscopy due to 
persistently elevated tTG. The frequency of persistent enteropathy noted is similar to 
findings from Ghazzawi et al. who found that 15% of pediatric patients with CD had 
persistent enteropathy on a GFD. The frequency of persistent enteropathy in our work is 
higher than Bannister et al. and Vecsei et al. who reported persistent enteropathy in 5% and 
9% of pediatric patients with CD on a GFD respectively (24,25,26). We found that 15.9% of 
patients with symptoms at the time of the repeat endoscopy had persistent enteropathy while 
26% of asymptomatic patients had persistent enteropathy at repeat endoscopy. 
Characteristics including presence of symptoms at the time of the repeat endoscopy, 
persistently elevated tTG, and following the GFD for less than two years were not predictive 
of persistent enteropathy. Poor adherence, particularly in teenagers could be a potential 
reason for persistent enteropathy especially in patients that do not report symptoms. 
However, in this group of patients who underwent repeat endoscopy, adherence to the GFD

 was evaluated by a dietician or gastroenterologist and 91% of subjects were found to have 
excellent adherence to the GFD. This high level of adherence may not reflect our general 
patient population however. Patients with symptoms or persistently elevated IgA TTG and 
clearly identified nonadherence/ongoing gluten exposure are unlikely to undergo repeat 
endoscopy as often as children without clear gluten exposure and would therefore not be 
included in this analysis.
IgA tTG was not an accurate measure of mucosal recovery in this population of pediatric 
patients with CD on a GFD. The NPV of IgA tTG was highest at 87% in patients treated 
with a GFD for more than two years however PPV was poor at 36%. Additionally, the NPV 
of tTG was not improved when correlated with the presence or absence of symptoms at the 
repeat endoscopy. Overall at the time of the follow-up biopsy, tTG was elevated in 43% of 
subjects with persistent enteropathy and 32% of subjects with mucosal healing. Specifically 
in subjects that were symptomatic at the time of the repeat endoscopy, 84% had mucosal 
recovery upon repeat biopsy. Only 55% of patients with persistent enteropathy at the time of 
the repeat endoscopy were symptomatic. Therefore, in our population, neither the presence 
of symptoms nor a positive tTG could be relied upon as a measure of mucosal recovery in 
patients with CD on a GFD.
Despite the clinical practice and endorsement of using serological tests as markers of dietary 
adherence and mucosal recovery in pediatric patients with CD on a GFD, these serology 
tests have not been validated for this purpose. Our findings raise concerns about this 
monitoring approach. Identifying the frequency of persistent enteropathy in children is 
important to begin to understand term consequences that may be associated with it. 
Furthermore identifying minimally invasive accurate surrogate endpoints for patients is of 
utmost importance to identify patients that may benefit from potential for new therapeutic 
agents that may serve as adjuvant medications to the GFD(27). Our work is in agreement 
with previous research that supports a lower accuracy of serological studies at the time of 
follow-up endoscopy compared to at diagnosis in patients with CD on a GFD. Bannister et. 
al evaluated 150 pediatric patients (mean age 7.5 years) diagnosed with CD who had been 
on a GFD for a mean of 1.4 years (25). They found that 5% of patients had persistent 
mucosal damage defined as Marsh 3 histology. In this study, IgA tTG and IgG deamidated 
gliadin peptides (DGP) were measured and used in combination at the time of the repeat 
endoscopy resulting in a sensitivity of 65% and specificity of 85%, a positive predictive 
value (PPV) of 22% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 98% (25). When the statistical 
approach was repeated with any equivocal values regarded as “positive” the NPV improved 
to 100% but the specificity dropped to 68%. While this combined approach resulted in a 
higher NPV, accuracy overall compared to diagnosis was sub-optimal. A separate study 
evaluated 53 children with CD (mean age 11.3 years) who underwent repeat endoscopy after 
approximately 2.2 years on a GFD (26). This study found that 9% of patients had persistent 
mucosal damage defined as Marsh 3 histology at the time of follow-up. In this study, the 
sensitivity of IgA tTG was 83% and specificity was 87% (26). These studies provide further 
evidence that current serological tests used as surrogate endpoints for mucosal recovery need 
further investigation. IgA tTG in combination with IgG DGP may provide a more accurate 
measure of mucosal recovery at the time of the repeat endoscopy. The negative predictive 
value of these tests when used in combination may be quite powerful.

 The utility of IgG DGP as a marker of mucosal disease in patients with CD on a GFD was 
corroborated in a recent comprehensive study evaluating twelve serological tests at the time 
of follow-up endoscopy in adult patients with CD on a GFD (28). This study used 
retrospective samples to examine 100 adult patients with CD who underwent a repeat biopsy 
after an average of 4.5 years on a GFD. In addition to finding that the manufacturer cutoff 
levels created for the diagnosis of CD are sub-optimal for patients with CD on a GFD, this 
study also showed that the IgG DGP correlated with residual intestinal damage as measured 
by a follow-up small intestinal biopsy in adult patients (28).
While we did not identify predictors of persistent mucosal damage in this pediatric 
population, Lebwohl et al. evaluated 7648 children and adults over an 8 year period in order 
to determine what factors may be predictive of persistent villous atrophy. In this study, 31% 
of patients had persistent villous atrophy at the time of the follow-up endoscopy which 
occurred at a median time of 1.3 years (29). Persistent villous blunting was more common in 
older patients and males, and less common in patients with higher educational attainment 
(29).
The limitations of our study include that the IgA tTG assay was run in multiple laboratories 
due to the retrospective nature. While not ideal, all laboratories were CLIA certified. For this 
reason and the purposes of the study, IgA tTG was dichotomized as positive or negative 
according to the cut off levels supplied by the laboratory performing the test. Additionally, 
we included only serology tests run within 4 months of the repeat endoscopy which reduced 
our sample size to 71 subjects for part of the analysis. Since both Boston Children’s Hospital 
and MassGeneral Hospital for Children are quaternary care centers, the results may not be 
generalizable to other institutions. Studies have suggested that patients referred to 
specialized centers were three times more likely to have non-responsive celiac disease 
(NRCD) than those initially followed at the quaternary care center (30). Furthermore, the 
use of centralized pathology reading, standard biopsy procedures including standardized 
locations and numbers of biopsies, and evaluating the mucosa for villous height to crypt 
depth ratio would provide a more accurate measure of mucosal recovery. Additionally, there 
was a wide range of time during which the repeat endoscopy was performed which does not 
allow us to comment on the natural history of mucosal recovery in pediatric CD. Finally, 
while all patients were advised about the GFD by a knowledgeable dietician, their adherence 
assessment was based on physician and or dietician report at the time of the clinic visit in 
this study.
We found that 19% of pediatric patients with CD on a GFD may have persistent enteropathy. 
While the long term effects are not known, persistent enteropathy may predispose pediatric 
patients with CD to future complications and suboptimal growth. Evidence in adult patients 
with CD is accumulating that not only is persistent enteropathy common but that the 
presence of symptoms is not predictive of enteropathy. Additionally, IgA tTG, while 
accurate at diagnosis, is a poor predictor of persistent enteropathy in children with CD on a 
GFD irrespective of whether symptoms are present. While current guidelines do not suggest 
a repeat endoscopy to assess for mucosal recovery, it is the only way to confirm it. Given the 
mounting evidence in adults, our concern for persistent enteropathy, particularly in growing 
children led to this retrospective study. Due to the retrospective nature, we cannot comment

 on the natural history of mucosal recovery in patients with CD on a GFD as patients did not 
undergo repeat endoscopy at a pre-determined time point. Therefore, these findings must be 
confirmed prospectively and systematically in order to evaluate the natural history of 
mucosal recovery in pediatric patients with CD on a GFD. Long term complications 
including growth trajectory must be monitored and further study evaluating available 
treatment options beyond the GFD and timing of subsequent endoscopies in patients found 
to have persistent enteropathy must be established. Our findings, show that nearly one in five 
children with CD may have persistent enteropathy despite maintaining a strict GFD (based 
on self-report and provider assessment) and that IgA tTG is not an accurate marker of 
mucosal healing. These findings suggest the need not only for a baseline endoscopy to 
confirm the diagnosis of CD, but consideration of a repeat endoscopy to confirm remission. 
These findings suggest that prospective studies which include objective measurements of 
dietary transgression are needed to establish whether the management criteria of CD in 
childhood should be revisited.

 1. WHAT IS KNOWN
•
Over 90% of pediatric patients with celiac disease achieve mucosal recovery 
after one year on a gluten free diet.
•
Current guidelines recommend follow-up serology both to assess dietary 
adherence and for use as a surrogate marker of mucosal recovery
2. WHAT IS NEW
•
1 in 5 children with celiac disease may have persistent enteropathy despite 
adherence to a GFD
•
IgA tTG may not be accurate marker of mucosal recovery in these patients
•
We did not identify characteristics predictive of persistent enteropathy in this 
population

*Patients had more than one reason for a repeat endoscopy. Reason was determined by chart review and therefore is >100%.
**Seven patients were asymptomatic and repeat endoscopy was performed to confirm CD resolution, four patients had seronegative CD at 
diagnosis and repeat endoscopy was performed to confirm CD resolution.
***Repeat serology was only included if it was measured within 4 months of the date of repeat endoscopy (N=71).
