Abstract
Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a chronic pain syndrome in the lower back
region, lasting for at least 3 months. CLBP represents the second leading
cause of disability worldwide being a major welfare and economic problem.
The prevalence of CLBP in adults has increased more than 100% in the last
decade and continues to increase dramatically in the aging population,
affecting both men and women in all ethnic groups, with a significant impact
on functional capacity and occupational activities. It can also be influenced
by psychological factors, such as stress, depression and/or anxiety. Given
this complexity, the diagnostic evaluation of patients with CLBP can be very
challenging and requires complex clinical decision-making. Answering the
question “what is the pain generator” among the several structures
potentially involved in CLBP is a key factor in the management of these
patients, since a mis-diagnosis can generate therapeutical mistakes.
Traditionally, the notion that the etiology of 80% to 90% of LBP cases is
unknown has been mistaken perpetuated across decades. In most cases,
low back pain can be attributed to specific pain generator, with its own
characteristics and with different therapeutical opportunity. Here we discuss
about radicular pain, facet Joint pain, sacro-iliac pain, pain related to lumbar
stenosis, discogenic pain. Our article aims to offer to the clinicians a simple
guidance to identify pain generators in a safer and faster way, relying a
correct diagnosis and further therapeutical approach.

 Introduction
Low back pain (LBP) is the most common musculoskeletal condi-
tion affecting the adult population, with a prevalence of up to 84%1. 
Chronic LBP (CLBP) is a chronic pain syndrome in the lower back 
region, lasting for at least 12 weeks2. Many authors suggest defin-
ing chronic pain as pain that lasts beyond the expected period of 
healing, avoiding this close time criterion. This definition is very 
important, as it underlines the concept that CLBP has well-defined 
underlying pathological causes and that it is a disease, not a 
symptom. CLBP represents the leading cause of disability world-
wide and is a major welfare and economic problem1. Given this 
complexity, the diagnostic evaluation of patients with LBP can be 
very challenging and requires complex clinical decision-making. 
Answering the question, “what is the pain generator?” among the 
several structures potentially involved in CLBP is a key factor in 
the management of these patients, since a mis-diagnosis can lead 
to therapeutic mistakes. This article aims to provide a brief clini-
cal guide that could help in the identification of pain generators 
through a careful anatomical description, thereby directing clini-
cians towards the correct diagnosis and therapeutic approach.
Low back pain epidemiology
LBP represents a major social and economic problem. The preva-
lence of CLBP is estimated to range from 15 to 45% in French 
healthcare workers3; the point prevalence of CLBP in US adults 
aged 20–69 years old was 13.1%4. The general population preva-
lence of CLBP is estimated to be 5.91% in Italy5. The prevalence of 
acute and CLBP in adults doubled in the last decade and continues 
to increase dramatically in the aging population, affecting both men 
and women in all ethnic groups6. LBP has a significant impact on 
functional capacity, as pain restricts occupational activities and is a 
major cause of absenteeism7–9. Its economic burden is represented 
directly by the high costs of health care spending and indirectly 
by decreased productivity7,9. These costs are expected to rise even 
more in the next few years. According to a 2006 review, the total 
costs associated with LBP in the United States exceed $100 billion 
per year, two-thirds of which are a result of lost wages and reduced 
productivity10.
Looking for the pain generator
LBP symptoms can derive from many potential anatomic sources, 
such as nerve roots, muscle, fascial structures, bones, joints, 
intervertebral discs (IVDs), and organs within the abdominal cavity. 
 
Moreover, symptoms can also spawn from aberrant neurological 
pain processing causing neuropathic LBP11,12. The diagnostic evalu-
ation of patients with LBP can be very challenging and requires 
complex clinical decision-making. Nevertheless, the identifica-
tion of the source of the pain is of fundamental importance in 
determining the therapeutic approach13. Furthermore, during the 
clinical evaluation, a clinician has to consider that LBP can also 
be influenced by psychological factors, such as stress, depres-
sion, and/or anxiety14,15. History should also include substance 
use exposure, detailed health history, work, habits, and psycho-
social factors16. Clinical information is the leading element that 
drives the initial impression, while magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) should be considered only in the presence of clinical ele-
ments that are not definitely clear or in the presence of neurologi-
cal deficits or other medical conditions17. The recommendation 
of the American College of Radiology is not to do imaging 
for LBP within the first 6 weeks unless red flags are present. 
They include recent significant trauma or milder trauma at age 
older than 50 years, unexplained weight loss, unexplained fever, 
immunosuppression, history of cancer, intravenous drug use, 
prolonged use of corticosteroids or osteoporosis, age older than 
70 years, and focal neurologic deficit with progressive or disabling 
symptoms18,19.
Imaging findings are weakly related to symptoms. In one cross- 
sectional study of asymptomatic persons aged 60 years or older, 
36% had a herniated disc, 21% had spinal stenosis, and more than 
90% had a degenerated or bulging disc20.
Although a precise estimate is impossible, it is plausible that the 
direct medical and indirect costs of these conditions are in the 
range of more than $50 billion per annum and could be as high as 
$100 billion at the extreme21. A recent study estimated that lumbar 
radiography was performed 66 million times in the United States 
in 2004, with a cost of $54 for each exam22. Although estimates 
vary substantially depending on geographic location, insurance 
status, and other factors, costs of MRI seem to be 10 to 15 times 
higher22,23.
Consensus guidelines for the management of LBP recommend that 
the clinician use contemporary best practice for assessment and 
treatment and, if chronic, use a multimodal and multi-disciplinary 
approach to avoid mis-diagnosis and mis-management.
Anatomy of the low back
The lumbar spine consists of five vertebrae (L1–L5). The complex 
anatomy of the lumbar spine is a combination of these strong ver-
tebrae, linked by joint capsules, ligaments, tendons, and muscles, 
with extensive innervation. The spine is designed to be strong, since 
it has to protect the spinal cord and spinal nerve roots. At the same 
time, it is highly flexible, providing for mobility in many different 
planes.
The mobility of the vertebral column is provided by the symphy-
seal joints between the vertebral bodies, with an IVD in between. 
The facet joints are located between and behind adjacent vertebrae, 
contributing to spine stability. They are found at every spinal level 
and provide about 20% of the torsional (twisting) stability in the 
neck and low back segments24. Ligaments aid in joint stability dur-
ing rest and movement, preventing injury from hyperextension and 
hyperflexion. The three main ligaments are the anterior longitu-
dinal ligament (ALL), posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL), and 
ligamentum flavum (LF). The canal is bordered by vertebral bod-
ies and discs anteriorly and by laminae and LF posteriorly. Both 
the ALL and PLL run the entire length of the spine, anteriorly and 
posteriorly, respectively. Laterally, spinal nerves and vessels come 
out from the intervertebral foramen. Beneath each lumbar vertebra, 
there is the corresponding foramen, from which spinal nerve roots 
exit. For example, the L1 neural foramina are located just below the 
L1 vertebra, from where the L1 nerve root exits.
IVDs are located between vertebrae. They are compressible 
structures able to distribute compressive loads through osmotic

 pressurization. In the IVD, the annulus fibrosus (AF), a concentric 
ring structure of organized lamellar collagen, surrounds the 
proteoglycan-rich inner nucleus pulposus (NP). Discs are avascular 
in adulthood, except for the periphery. At birth, the human disc has 
some vascular supply but these vessels soon recede, leaving the disc 
with little direct blood supply in the healthy adult25. Hence, meta-
bolic support of much of the IVD is dependent on the cartilaginous 
endplates adjacent to the vertebral body. A meningeal branch of 
the spinal nerve, better known as the recurrent sinuvertebral nerve, 
innervates the area around the disc space26.
The lumbar spine is governed by four functional groups of 
muscles, split into extensors, flexors, lateral flexors, and rotators. 
The lumbar vertebrae are vascularized by lumbar arteries that 
originate in the aorta. Spinal branches of the lumbar arteries enter 
the intervertebral foramen at each level, dividing themselves into 
smaller anterior and posterior branches27. The venous drainage 
parallels the arterial supply28.
Typically, the end of the spinal cord forms the conus medulla-
ris within the lumbar spinal canal at the lower margin of the L2 
vertebra29. All lumbar spinal nerve roots stem from the connection 
between the dorsal or posterior (somatic sensory) root from the 
posterolateral aspect of the spinal cord and the ventral or anterior 
(somatic motor) root from the anterolateral aspect of the cord29. The 
roots then flow down through the spinal canal, developing into the 
cauda equina, before exiting as a single pair of spinal nerves at their 
respective intervertebral foramina. Cell bodies of the motor nerve 
fibers can be found in the ventral or anterior horns of the spinal 
cord, whereas those of the sensory nerve fibers are in the dorsal 
root ganglion (DRG) at each level. One or more recurrent menin-
geal branches, known as the sinuvertebral nerves, run out from the 
lumbar spinal nerves. The sinuvertebral nerve, or Luschka’s 
nerve, is a recurrent branch created from the merging of the grey 
ramus communicans (GRC) with a small branch coming from the 
proximal end of the anterior primary ramus of the spinal nerve. 
This polisegmentary mixed nerve directly re-enters the spinal canal 
and gives off ascending and descending anastomosing branches 
comprising both somatic and autonomic fibers for the posterola-
teral annulus, the posterior vertebral body and the periostium, and 
the ventral meninges30,31. The sinuvertebral nerves connect with 
branches from radicular levels both above and below the point of 
entry, in addition to the contralateral side, meaning that localizing 
pain from involvement of these nerves is challenging32. Also, the 
facet joints receive two-level innervation comprising somatic and 
autonomic components. The former convey a well-defined local 
pain, while the autonomic afferents transmit referred pain.
Pathophysiology of spinal pain
Pain is mediated by nociceptors, specialized peripheral sensory 
neurons that alert us to potentially damaging stimuli at the skin by 
transducing these stimuli into electrical signals that are relayed to 
higher brain centers33. Nociceptors are pseudo-unipolar primary 
somatosensory neurons with their neuronal body located in the 
 
DRG. They are bifurcate axons: the peripheral branch innervates 
 
the skin and the central branches synapse on second-order neurons 
 
in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord34. The second-order neurons 
project to the mesencephalon and thalamus, which project to 
 
somatosensory and anterior cingulate cortices to drive sensory- 
discriminative and affective-cognitive aspects of pain, respectively. 
The spinal dorsal horn is a major site of integration of somatosen-
sory information and is composed of several interneuron popula-
tions forming descending inhibitory and facilitatory pathways, able 
to modulate the transmission of nociceptive signals35. If the noxious 
stimulus persists, processes of peripheral and central sensitization 
can occur, converting pain from acute to chronic. Central sensitiza-
tion is characterized by the increase in the excitability of neurons 
within the central nervous system, so that normal inputs begin to 
produce abnormal responses36. It is responsible for tactile allodynia, 
that is pain evoked by light brushing of the skin, and for the spread 
of pain hypersensitivity beyond an area of tissue damage. Central 
sensitization occurs in a number of chronic pain disorders, such 
as temporomandibular disorders, LBP, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, 
headache, and lateral epicondylalgia37. Despite improved knowl-
edge of the processes leading to central sensitization, it is still dif-
ficult to treat38,39. Peripheral and central sensitization have a key role 
in LBP chronification. In fact, minimal changes in posture could 
easily drive long-lasting inflammation in the joints, ligaments, and 
muscles involved in the stability of the low back column, contrib-
uting to both peripheral and central sensitization. Furthermore, 
joints, discs, and bone are richly innervated by A delta fibers 
whose continuous stimulation could easily contribute to central 
sensitization.
Type of spinal pain according to pain generator
In spite of the hard work done by the International Association 
for the Study of Pain39, there remains a degree of confusion in the 
medical community regarding the definitions of back pain, referred 
pain, radicular pain, and radiculopathy. Nevertheless, a precise 
diagnostic assessment is necessary to indicate the right treatment. 
 
Mis-diagnosis and mis-management of CLBP can also be influ-
enced by other considerations, such as insufficient knowledge or 
appreciation of the common structure for specific pain referral 
 
patterns, inadequate clinical reasoning, unsuitable referral, and a 
preference for popular management approaches. Mostly, LBP is con-
sidered to be nonspecific40, and the mistaken idea that the cause of 
80 to 90% of LBP cases is unknown has persisted for decades41–45.
Muscle tension and spasm are among the most common reasons 
for LBP, for example, in patients with fibromyalgia. In other cases, 
LBP can be attributed to different pain generators, with specific 
characteristics, such as radicular, facet joint, sacro-iliac, and disco-
genic pain, as well as spinal stenosis.
Radicular pain
Radicular pain is pain evoked by ectopic discharges emanating 
from an inflamed or lesioned dorsal root or its ganglion; gener-
ally, the pain radiates from the back and buttock into the leg in 
a dermatomal distribution44. Disc herniation is the most com-
mon cause, and inflammation of the affected nerve rather than 
its compression is the most common pathophysiological proc-
ess. Radicular pain is pain irradiated along the nerve root without 
neurological impairment. Even though it is nociceptive pain, it is 
distinguished from usual nociception because in radicular pain the 
axons are not stimulated along their course or in their peripheral 
terminals but from the perinevrium40,46. Radicular pain differs from

 radiculopathy in several aspects. Radiculopathy is a neurological 
state in which conduction is impaired along a spinal nerve or its 
roots. When sensory fibers are impaired, numbness is the main 
symptom and sign, whereas when motor fibers are blocked weak-
ness ensues. Diminished reflexes can occur as a result of either 
sensory or motor block. The numbness is dermatomal in distribu-
tion and the weakness is myotomal. Although radiculopathy and 
radicular pain often accompany one another, radiculopathy has 
been observed in the absence of pain, and radicular pain may hap-
pen in the absence of radiculopathy46,47. It is important to underline 
that, contrary to popular belief, it is not possible to make a distinc-
tion among the patterns of L4, L5, and S1 radicular pain48,49. In fact, 
only when radiculopathy is seen together with radicular pain can 
segments be estimated. In such cases, the dermatomal distribution 
of numbness indicates the segment of origin rather than the distri-
bution of pain. Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy can be 
diagnosed during clinical examination using manual muscle testing, 
supine straight leg raise, Lasègue sign, and crossed Lasègue sign.
If a patient’s history and physical examination findings indicate 
lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy, the most suitable non-
invasive test to confirm this could be an MRI. This is particularly 
important if it is necessary to proceed with an invasive treatment 
or to better define the neurological impairment. The next most 
appropriate test to evaluate the presence of lumbar disc herniation 
is computed tomography (CT) or CT myelography, which would 
be suitable for those individuals unable to have an MRI because 
it is contraindicated or those for whom MRI is inconclusive. Also, 
diagnosis of nerve root compression may be achieved by electrodi-
agnostic studies, although they are not able to distinguish between 
lumbar disc herniation and other causes of nerve root compres-
sion. Unfortunately, we have to remark that radiculopathy could 
be present without radicular pain and vice versa. For these rea-
sons, electrodiagnostic tests are not recommended as a first-line 
 
approach but only as a second-line one in order to define if there is 
a concomitant presence of peripheral neuropathy or neuralgia or to 
follow up the impairment of the lesioned nerve50.
Facet joint syndrome
The lumbar zygapophyseal joints are the posterior articular 
 
process of the lumbar column. They are formed from the inferior 
process of upper vertebra and the superior articular process of 
lower vertebra51. They are supplied by the medial branches of the 
dorsal rami (MBN). These joints have a large amount of free and 
encapsulated nerve endings52 that activate nociceptive afferents and 
that are also modulated by sympathetic efferent fibers53. Lumbar 
zygapophyseal or “facet” joint pain has been estimated to account 
for up to 30% of CLBP cases54, with nociception originating in the 
synovial membrane, hyaline cartilage, bone, or fibrous capsule of 
the facet joint55.
Diagnosis of facet joint syndrome is often difficult and requires a 
careful clinical assessment and an accurate analysis of radiological 
exams. Patients usually complain of LBP with or without somatic 
referral to the legs terminating above the knee, often radiating to 
 
the thigh or to the groin. There is no radicular pattern. Back pain 
tends to be off-center and the pain intensity is worse than the leg 
pain; pain increases with hyperextension, rotation, lateral bending, 
and walking uphill. It is exacerbated when waking up from bed 
or trying to stand after prolonged sitting. Finally, patients often 
complain of back stiffness, which is typically more evident in the 
morning56,57. Jackson identified seven factors significantly cor-
related with facet pain: older age, previous history of LBP, 
normal gait, maximal pain with lumbar extension, absence of leg 
pain, absence of muscle spasm, and absence of exacerbation with 
Valsalva maneuver58.
There are no pathognomonic radiological findings for the diagno-
sis of lumbar facet syndrome. With MRI, we can find non-specific 
signs of arthrosis, osteophytes, and hypertrophy of flaval ligaments. 
However, if we want to better study arthrosis problems, CT is 
the preferred imaging method, even if radiation exposure should 
be kept in mind56. One of the most important exams is provided 
by X-rays, especially dynamic projections, that can show col-
umn instability (listhesis that could be increased with flexion and 
 
extension of the low back column) with a clear overload of these 
joints58. In conclusion, despite the contribution from neuroimaging, 
history and clinical examination remain fundamental steps in the 
diagnosis of facet joint syndromes.
Sacroiliac joint pain
The sacroiliac joints (SIJs) are highly specialized joints that permit 
stable (yet flexible) support to the upper body59,60. Sacral movement 
involves the SIJs and also directly influences the discs and most 
likely the higher lumbar joints as well. Its innervation is still not 
well known; innervation by branches from the ventral lumbopel-
vic rami has been reported61 but not verified. Conversely, innerva-
tion of the SIJ by small branches from the posterior rami has been 
 
reported by numerous authors62,63. In 2012, Patel et al.63 reported 
successful attenuation of SIJ pain using neurotomy of the L5 dorsal 
primary ramus and lateral branches of the dorsal sacral rami from 
S1 to S3. Hence, there is sufficient evidence that this procedure 
has an important value for establishing diagnosis and prognosis. 
The SIJ is well recognized as a source of pain in many patients 
who present with CLBP64,65. Theories of pain generation include 
ligamentous or capsular tension, extraneous compression or shear 
forces, hypomobility or hypermobility, aberrant joint mechanics, 
and imbalances in the myofascial or kinetic chain that result in 
inflammation and pain66. Intra-articular sources of SIJ pain include 
osteoarthritis; extra-articular sources include enthesis/ligamentous 
sprain and primary enthesopathy. In addition, ligamentous, tendi-
nous, or fascial attachment and other cumulative soft tissue inju-
ries that may occur posterior to the dorsal aspect of the SIJ may 
be a source of discomfort. In physical examination, it is important 
to examine the movement of the joint, for example with a stress 
test, consisting of pressing down on the iliac crest (pelvis) or upper 
thigh, which may reproduce the patient’s pain.
SIJ pain is often underdiagnosed. It has to be considered in every 
situation in which the patient complains of postural LBP that wors-
ens in a sitting position and with postural changes. Furthermore, 
it is possible that SIJ pain is often strictly related to facet joint 
syndromes as both are related to postural problems.
Finally, it is important to consider that SIJ pain could also be a sign 
of rheumatic disease. MRI findings of articular effusion and inflam-
mation (especially if bilateral) can alert the clinician to consider 
this condition.

Lumbar spinal stenosis
Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) can be congenital67 or acquired (or 
both). It could be determined by inflammatory/scar tissue after 
spine surgery or, even in absence of previous surgery, by disc her-
niation, thickening of the ligaments, or hypertrophy of the articular 
processes68. The majority of cases of LSS are degenerative, related 
to changes in the spine with aging69. LSS is determined by a pro-
gressive narrowing of the central spinal canal and the lateral recesses 
and consequent compression of neurovascular structures70. Usually, 
the diameter of the normal lumbar spinal canal varies from 15 to 
27 mm. We can define lumbar stenosis as a spinal canal diameter 
of less than 10 mm, even though a stenosis with diameter of 12 mm 
or less in some patients can be symptomatic. The normal forami-
nal height varies from 20 to 23 mm, with the indicator of poten-
tial foraminal stenosis as 15 mm or less71. Degenerative LSS is the 
most common indication for spinal surgery in people older than 
65 years of age70. The most frequent symptoms of lumbar stenosis 
are midline back pain, radiculopathy with neurologic claudication, 
Page 6 of 10
F1000Research 2016, 5(F1000 Faculty Rev):1530 Last updated: 16 MAY 2019
 motor weakness, paresthesia, and impairment of sensory nerves72. 
Symptoms may have a different distribution depending on the 
type of LSS. If the LSS is central, there may be involvement of 
the area between the facet joints, and pain may be bilateral in a 
non-dermatomal distribution. With lateral recess stenosis, symp-
toms are usually found dermatomally because specific nerves are 
compressed, resembling unilateral radiculopathy73. Pain improves 
with trunk flexion, sitting, stooping, or lying and aggravates 
with prolonged standing or lumbar extension. As the condition 
becomes more advanced, sitting or lying down are less helpful in 
relieving the pain. In severe cases, rest pain or a neurogenic blad-
der can develop73. Neurogenic claudication pain is the classical 
symptom of LSS, caused by venous congestion and hypertension 
around nerve roots. Pain is exacerbated by standing erect and by 
downhill ambulation but alleviated with lying supine more than 
prone, sitting, squatting, and lumbar flexion74,75.
LSS is generally diagnosed based on a combination of history, 
physical examination, and imaging72. The most useful findings 
from the history are age, radiating leg pain that is exacerbated by 
standing up or walking, and the absence of pain when seated76. The 
gait and posture after walking may reveal a positive “stoop test”75,76, 
performed by asking the patient to walk briskly. As the pain inten-
sifies, patients may complain of sensory symptoms followed by 
motor symptoms, and if they assume a stooped posture, symptoms 
may improve76. If patients sit in a chair bent forward, they may 
have the same relief77.
The recommended method for confirming the diagnosis of LSS is 
MRI, which facilitates the assessment of the spinal canal and the 
anatomic relationship between spinal and neural elements76. The 
natural course of untreated LSS is unclear. The North American 
Spine Society (NASS) clinical guidelines concluded that the natu-
ral course is favorable in a third to a half of patients with clinically 
mild to moderate LSS78. Other reviews suggest that the condition 
may deteriorate in some patients and improve in about a third of 
others, with most patients remaining unchanged for up to 8 years 
of follow-up79–81.
Discogenic pain
Disc degeneration (DD) has been estimated as the source of CLBP 
in 39% of cases82. Its symptoms are aspecific, axial, and without 
radicular radiation and they occur in the absence of spinal deformity 
or instability. DD is often a diagnosis of exclusion among other 
types of CLBP. Pathologically, it is characterized by the degrada-
tion, within the disc, of the NP matrix with accompanying radial 
and/or concentric fissures in the AF83.
Despite numerous recent advances, the main issue is how inflam-
mation is initiated and sustained to lead to CLBP. A possible 
explanation could involve the growth of nerves capable of signaling 
pain deep into the annular structures84. Another hypothesis involves 
a class of molecules, called damage-associated molecular patterns 
(DAMPs), including hyaluronic acid and fibronectin fragments, 
able to stimulate sterile inflammation of the disc through the 
action of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8) 
and matrix degrading enzymes (MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13)83. 
Also, subclinical anaerobic bacterial infection, encouraged by 
hypoxic conditions, could have a role in the development of 
discogenic pain84.
Imaging MRI can detect changes in the endplates and in the ver-
tebral bone marrow, such as edema in the vertebral bodies (Modic 
type 1). Clinical trials have demonstrated that some patients 
suffering from LBP have improvement following amoxicillin- 
clavulanate84,85. Moreover, diabetes increases the risk of developing 
painful DD because advanced glycation end products (AGEs) 
induce catabolism and promote inflammation86.
MRI cannot definitively demonstrate whether a disc is painful87. 
Provocation discography aims at reproducing patients’ pain through 
contrast injection during live fluoroscopy plus CT imaging for 
clarifying associated morphological abnormalities of the disc88. 
The clinical utility of discography and its diagnostic accuracy 
is, however, a matter of controversy because of poor specificity. 
Beyond the reported complications as discitis, neurologic injury, 
visceral injury, and dye reactions89, it’s been demonstrated that the 
needle puncture of the lumbar disc may lead to accelerated MRI-
documented DD. The mechanism is likely multifactorial: structural 
damage caused by the needle, pressurization, and toxicity of the 
contrast media90.
Concluding remarks
LBP is one of the most common symptoms and conditions moti-
vating individuals to seek medical consultation. The effects of 
back pain on society are significant, both epidemiologically and 
economically, and this is likely to only further increase owing 
to a combination of shifting attitudes and expectations, medical 
 
management techniques, and social provision. Therapeutical 
approaches, including interventional modalities, for LBP are highly 
effective when used properly after a careful diagnostic work-up. 
Consensus guidelines for the management of LBP advise contem-
porary best practice for assessment and treatment and the use of a 
multimodal and multi-disciplinary approach to avoid mis-diagnosis 
and mis-management in chronic cases.
