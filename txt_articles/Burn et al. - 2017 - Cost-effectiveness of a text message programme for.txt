AbstrAct
Objective To estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
Tobacco, Exercise and Diet Messages (TEXT ME), a 
text message-based intervention that provides advice, 
motivation, information and support to improve health-
related behaviours.
Methods A lifetime Markov model was used to 
estimate major vascular events (myocardial infarctions 
and strokes) avoided, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
gained, costs to the health system and the incremental 
cost per QALY gained. The model was informed by data 
from a randomised controlled trial of TEXT ME, with 
evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses 
used to estimate the effects of changes in risk factors 
on the risk of major vascular events. Expected costs 
and health outcomes were estimated with uncertainty 
surrounding these characterised using probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis and a number of scenario analyses.
results For a target population of 50 000 patients with 
documented coronary heart disease, the intervention is 
expected to lead to 563 fewer myocardial infarctions, 
361 fewer strokes and 1143 additional QALYs. TEXT ME 
is expected to lead to an overall saving of $10.56 million 
for the health system over the patients’ lifetimes. The 
intervention can therefore be considered cost-saving 
and health-improving. Neither parameter nor structural 
uncertainty had a significant impact on the conclusion 
that TEXT ME is cost-effective.
conclusions The provision of TEXT ME is predicted to 
lead to better health outcomes and an overall saving in 
costs for the health system.

IntrOductIOn
Cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coro-
nary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, are the 
leading causes of lost years of healthy life glob-
ally.1 Smoking, physical inactivity and obesity 
increase the risk of developing CVD and of recur-
rent cardiovascular events among patients with a 
history of CVD.1 While adhering to behavioural 
recommendations improves health outcomes,2 the 
prevalence of healthy behaviours among those with 
a history of CHD is low, with poor knowledge of 
risk factors reported.3
Telehealth 
interventions 
are 
an 
effec-
tive means of delivering behavioural change 
secondary prevention programmes to patients 
with CVD,4 and text message interventions have 
achieved behaviour change among other chronic 
disease populations.5 This prompted the develop-
ment of the Tobacco, Exercise and Diet Messages 
(TEXT ME) intervention for patients with CHD, 
with the messages developed based on behaviour 
change theory, national guidelines and input from 
health professionals.6 TEXT ME has recently been 
assessed in a randomised controlled trial, where 
individuals with documented CHD were recruited 
through inpatient and outpatient cardiology 
services at a large tertiary referral centre in Sydney, 
Australia.7 8
CVD prevention requires scalable approaches 
that provide clinical benefit and value, with benefits 
justifying the costs incurred. The aim of this study 
is to estimate the potential scaled-up and long-term 
benefits of the TEXT ME programme, and evaluate 
the value for money of the programme if it were 
provided in Australia.
MethOds
target population
Based on the TEXT ME study eligibility criteria,8 the 
target population for the intervention is individuals 
with documented CHD, defined as prior myocar-
dial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft 
surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention or 
50% or greater stenosis in at least one major 
epicardial vessel on coronary angiography, who 
are admitted to Australian public hospitals. For this 
analysis, we considered the cost-effectiveness of the 
intervention if provided to a target population of 
50 
000 patients. Given that over a million patients 
are admitted to hospital in Australia annually with 
CVD as either the principal or additional diagnosis, 
50 
000 was considered to be a feasible target for the 
initial roll-out of the intervention across a state in 
Australia.9
comparators
TEXT ME consists of four text messages via short 
message service (SMS) per week for 24 weeks. The 
messages target multiple risk factors and provide 
advice, motivation, information and support to 
improve health behaviours (box 1). A bank of 
messages was developed with input from investi-
gators, clinicians, academics and patients through 
a multistage iterative process, and for each partici-
pant, messages are selected depending on their key 
baseline characteristics, such as their smoking status. 
The development of this intervention has previously 
been described in detail.7 As TEXT ME is supple-
mentary to usual care, the costs and health outcomes

associated with providing TEXT ME alongside usual care were 
compared against those from providing usual care alone.
decision-analytical model
A lifetime Markov model is used to provide the framework for 
the analysis. The model, shown in figure 1, consisted of six health 
states: history of CHD, MI, stroke, history of MI, history of stroke 
and dead. The model had a cycle length of 6 months. In line with a 
model developed to assess the impact of primary prevention,10 the 
key simplifying assumption was that individuals can only have one 
of either an MI or a stroke, after which they move to and then 
remain in the history of secondary event state until death.
health outcomes
Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were the primary measure of 
health benefit. By estimating health effects in terms of QALYs, 
which provide a measure of both quantity and quality of life, 
the value for money of providing TEXT ME can be compared 
against that of providing a wide range of interventions across 
the health system. Life years and number of MIs and strokes for 
the cohort were also estimated under usual care and TEXT ME.
Measurement of effectiveness
The effectiveness of TEXT ME on risk factor levels was based 
on the findings of the randomised controlled trial, where 710 
participants were enrolled and randomised into receiving the 
intervention or usual care, and data were collected at baseline 
and after 6 months.8
Relative risk reductions for MI and stroke were estimated 
on the basis of differences in risk factors observed within the 
trial (figure 2). Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were used, 
with these having estimated the relative risk reductions for MI 
and stroke associated with changes in low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and smoking 
(table 1).11–14 Relative risks were based on the size of the risk 
factor difference, with a log-linear relationship applied; for 
example, if an X mm Hg SBP reduction was estimated to lead 
to a relative risk of Y, then the relative risk for an SBP reduction 
of Z was estimated as YZ/X. As no interaction or effect modifica-
tion across these risk factors is known, the risk reductions asso-
ciated with each modality were multiplied in order to estimate 
an overall relative risk reduction.
Relative risk reductions associated with the intervention were 
reduced by 25% over the first year to take into account an expected 
lag in intervention effects. Given that the risk factor differences 
were only observed at 6 months, these were required to be extrap-
olated into the future. To take into account the likely drop off of 
intervention effects, in the base case analysis, it was assumed that 
any relative risk reductions estimated at 6 months would steadily 
diminish until being entirely mitigated after 5 years.
The risks for major vascular events under usual care were 
based on the number of events observed in the control arms of

randomised trials of LDL-C-lowering statin therapies for individ-
uals at high risk, with 4.8% and 4.9% risks of MI events observed 
annually for men and women, respectively, and 1.6% and 2.2% 
for 
strokes.11 The risk of death following major vascular events was 
based on age-specific survival rates reported for Australia.15 In the 
absence of an event, the risk of death was based on Australian 
life tables,16 which were doubled, in line with economic evalua-
tions with similar patient cohorts,17 to reflect the greater mortality 
rates for patients with a history of CHD. A risk of death of 1 was 
assumed if individuals reached 100 years old.
Measurement and valuation of preference-based outcomes
The SF-12 survey was undertaken at baseline and 6 months in 
the TEXT ME trial, with data collectors blinded to treatment 
assignment.8 These responses were transformed into SF-6D 
using the algorithm provided by Brazier et al,18 and, as SF-6D 
at 6 months was similar between treatment groups, these scores 
were pooled and used to inform the estimated quality of life of 
the history of CHD state.
Quality of life associated with a MI event was based on scores 
reported 3 months following a MI observed within an RCT setting 
in the UK.19 In line with previous economic evaluations,20 it was 
assumed that quality of life score for the history of MI would be 
equal to that of the history of CHD state subsequently. Mean-
while, quality of life associated with stroke was informed by scores 
reported 3 months following an ischaemic stroke within an obser-
vational cohort of patients, while the history of stroke state was 
based on the 6-month scores from the same patients.21
estimating resources and costs
A health system perspective was taken, with only those costs being 
borne by the health system included in the analysis. The costs asso-
ciated with the provision of the TEXT ME programme were esti-
mated in consultation with the programme staff. They used their 
administrative records and experience from undertaking the trial 
to estimate the volume of resources required and market prices. As 
well as the cost of providing the intervention, costs due to health-
care utilisation were also incorporated. Primary care costs were 
based on records from the Medicare Benefits Schedule and the 
Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which contain records of primary 
care consultations and prescriptions, respectively, of the trial 
participants in 2014. Meanwhile, hospital costs relating to major 
vascular events were based on the age- and gender-specific cost per 
hospital separation reported for Australia.22 All costs are reported

in 2014 Australian dollars. In line with guidelines for Australia, 
both future costs and QALYs were discounted by 3% annually.
Analytical methods
The decision-analytical model was used to estimate expected 
(mean) costs and health outcomes, with the uncertainty around 
these expected effects estimated. Expected results were given 
with all parameters held at their mean values and under base case 
assumptions. Uncertainty around the expected (mean) effects was 
assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis, with input parame-
ters assigned probability distributions and 1000 Monte Carlo simu-
lations conducted based on these distributions and SEs. The sets 
of estimated costs and QALYs from each simulations are shown, 
alongside the expected results, on a cost-effectiveness plane. This 
approach captures parameter uncertainty, uncertainty in the esti-
mation of the parameter of interest, but does not assess stochastic 
uncertainty, random variability in outcomes, or patient heteroge-
neity, the variability between individuals, which can be attributed 
to given characteristics.23
The timing over which an investment in TEXT ME would 
become cost-effective was considered using a net benefit 
curve.24 This plots the expected net health benefit, which is equal 
to the expected change in health outcomes minus the change in 
costs divided by the cost-effectiveness threshold, associated with 
providing the intervention over the time horizon of the analysis. 
The cost-effectiveness threshold used was $64 
000, which has been 
estimated to be the willingness to pay for an additional QALY in 
Australia.25 When net health benefit is positive, it indicates that 
the intervention is cost-effective over the given time horizon; 
for example, if net benefit is positive at 5 years, this implies that 
the health benefits that accrue over these 5 years merit the costs 
incurred up to this point.
Several tests were conducted on the sensitivity of results to 
changes in structural assumptions with the analysis re-run under 
alternative scenarios conservative against TEXT ME. First, relative 
risk reductions were assumed to be mitigated entirely after 1 year 
rather than 5 years. Second, the baseline risk of major vascular 
events was reduced by 50%. Third, the estimated differences in 
risk factors were held at their low values from 95% CI. Fourth, 
the expected cost of TEXT ME is doubled. These scenarios were 
then run together. In addition, a one-way sensitivity analysis was 
undertaken to see by how much the intervention cost would need 
to change for the result of the evaluation to alter.
results
study parameters
The characteristics of the study population are detailed in table 2. 
The provision of TEXT ME was expected to lead to a reduction in 
LDL-C, SBP and smoking. For example, for women, TEXT ME was 
associated with an expected reduction of 8.16 in SBP
, 0.1 
mmol/L 
for LDL-C and a 26% reduction in the proportion of smokers 
(table 2). This would be expected to lead to an expected relative 
risk of 0.72 for MI and 0.61 for a stroke (table 1), all else equal.
Delivering the intervention involves setting up IT servers and 
cloud space to manage the data at an expected annual cost of 
Australian $75 
000. A project manager working full time and 
a clinical advisor spending a fifth of their time on the interven-
tion would be required, and these were expected to be receiving 
salaries of A$100 
000 and A$50 
000, respectively, both with 30% 
on-costs. Clinical staff would be required to enrol patients, and this 
was expected to take 15 
min per participant. Assuming clinical staff 
received a salary of A$100 
000 with 30% on-costs and 4 weeks of 
holiday, each 15 
min would cost A$17 and enrolment of the entire 
cohort would cost $846 
354. The expected cost of sending an SMS 
was $0.10, and with participants receiving 96 messages over the 
course of the intervention, the cost of sending SMS messages to 
the cohort was expected to be A$480 
000. A further A$100 
000 
was expected to be budgeted for any miscellaneous expenses. The 
intervention as a whole was therefore expected to have a total cost 
of $1.66 
million or A$33 per participant (table 2).
Incremental costs and outcomes
Under base case assumptions, men had a mean life expectancy of 
14.21 if receiving usual care and 14.23 if receiving TEXT ME, 
while women had a life expectancy of 17.45 and 17.48, respec-
tively. The provision of TEXT ME was estimated to lead to 563 
fewer MIs and 361 fewer strokes over the course of these years.

As a result, the intervention was expected to lead to 1006 addi-
tional life years and a gain of 1143 QALYs (1469 if undiscounted). 
While the provision of TEXT ME was expected to cost  
Australian 
$1.66 
million (table 2), the reduction in major vascular events 
(MIs and strokes) was expected to lead to an overall cost-saving 
of A $10.56 
million (table 3). TEXT ME can therefore be consid-
ered ‘dominant’, with it expected to lead to better health outcomes 
and cost-savings. Indeed, the intervention can be considered cost- 
effective even after accounting for only the improvements in health 
outcomes which occur over the first year following its provision 
(figure 3).
Parameter uncertainty
Parameter uncertainty had little effect on the conclusion that 
TEXT ME is cost-effective. Under base case assumptions, the 
intervention was health-improving and cost-saving given each of 
the sets of simulated costs and effects (figure 4).
structural uncertainty
Under all of the individual scenario analyses, TEXT ME was 
expected to be cost-saving and health-improving (table 3). 
When all scenarios were run simultaneously TEXT ME was no 
longer expected to be cost-saving but would still be considered 
cost-effective given a willingness to pay for an additional QALY 
of $64 
000.25 Under base case assumptions, TEXT ME was cost-
saving if the intervention cost was less than $245 per participant 
and cost-effective given a cost of less than A$1750 per participant.
dIscussIOn
In Australia, the provision of TEXT ME was expected to lead 
to be health-improving and cost-saving, with the benefits of 
the intervention quickly outweighing its costs. Sensitivity anal-
yses found that sources of uncertainty had little impact on the 
conclusion that TEXT ME was a cost-effective use of healthcare 
resources for the cohort as a whole.
Economic evaluations of CVD management programmes have 
varied in methodologies, making direct comparisons difficult, but 
a number of other evaluations have also found secondary preven-
tion programmes to be cost-effective.26 While two other tele-
health interventions, both of which are based on one-to-one tele-
phone calls, have been estimated to be health-improving,26 they 
have been found to be costly to provide. Text message-based 
intervention, such as TEXT ME, therefore, seems to offer a 
more cost-effective method of delivering a telehealth interven-
tion for such patients. Indeed, participants in the trial of TEXT 
ME were engaged with and positive about the programme, with 
Figure 3 Net benefit curve. The timing over which an investment in TEXT ME would become cost-effective given a cost-effectiveness threshold used 
is $64 000. QALYs, quality-adjusted life years; TEXT ME, Tobacco, Exercise and Diet Messages.

this due to the programme being initiated close to the time of 
a cardiovascular event, receiving consistent messages following 
in-hospital education and management, having the opportunity 
for face-to-face contact at programme commencement and the 
messages being personalised.27
The principal limitations of this evaluation are due to the 
requirement to extrapolate changes in risk factors observed after 
6 months into the future and to link these changes to risk reduc-
tions for major vascular events. The model used allows such an 
extrapolation but is a simplification of reality allowing individ-
uals to have only one future major vascular event. There is no 
way of knowing with certainty how differences will be main-
tained into the future, and the base case assumption that any 
relative risk reductions would steadily diminish until being elim-
inated after 5 years is necessarily a subjective estimate. In addi-
tion, the impact of events on quality of life is based on the liter-
ature, while background mortality is expected to be in line with 
general population life tables, which have been doubled to reflect 
the greater morbidity of the patient cohort. Given that these esti-
mates are based on distinct patient populations, they may not 
truly reflect what would be realised by the model cohort. While 
significant parameter uncertainty undoubtedly surrounds such 
inputs, sensitivity analyses have been undertaken, which show 
the conclusions of this evaluation to be robust. Structural uncer-
tainty has a more serious impact on the conclusions; however, 
with the intervention no longer expected to be cost-saving if risk 
reductions are mitigated entirely after 1 year, the baseline risk of 
events is halved, and realised treatment effects are at the lower 
CI of those estimated in the trial and the cost of the intervention 
is doubled. Costs and outcomes are estimated for the cohort as a 
whole, and it should be noted that individual results would vary 
due to both random variability and variability between individ-
uals, which can be attributed to given characteristics.
The benefits of the intervention may in fact be underestimated 
given that only two types of vascular events, MI and stroke, 
were included in the model. Any sustained changes in risk 
factors would reduce the risk for any number of future events; 
however, for model parsimony, all possible future events were 
not included. In addition, the effect of differences in body mass 
index and physical activity, which were observed in the trial of 
TEXT ME,8 both of which have been shown to have an impact 
on health outcomes related to CVD,28 29 were not incorporated 
in the analysis. As well as reducing the risk of vascular events, 
changes in these risk factors would likely lead to reduced health-
care costs, for example, with fewer antihypertensives prescribed. 
In addition, MIs  were only expected to reduce quality of life 
over the subsequent 6 months, which is likely to underestimate 
the impact of such events.
TEXT ME is predicted here to lead to better health outcomes 
and reduced healthcare costs in Australia. Given the low preva-
lence of healthy behaviours among those with a history of CHD 
across a wide range of countries30 and the substantial propor-
tion of the global burden of disease caused by CVD,1 the results 
here are likely to be of relevance for all health systems. Tele-
medicine and, in particular, SMS-based interventions provide 
an affordable and scalable means for delivering health interven-
tions. This research suggests they can also provide good value 
for money.

Key messages
What is already known about this subject?
mHealth interventions have shown promise in being able to improve 
cardiovascular risk factor levels in patients with cardiovascular 
disease or at high cardiovascular risk. While they appear to 
be potentially low-cost interventions to deliver, formal cost-
effectiveness evaluations are required to support the uptake of new 
interventions by healthcare payers.
What does this study add?
This study provides information on the cost-effectiveness of a 
secondary prevention programme (TEXT ME) delivered by mobile 
phone text message to patients with coronary heart disease. Delivery 
of the TEXT ME intervention is predicted to lead to better health 
outcomes and an overall saving for the health system, given the 
major vascular events avoided and the relatively low costs of the 
intervention.
how might this impact on clinical practice?
These findings can prompt healthcare providers to implement text 
message-based prevention programmes, which should lead to 
patients gaining access to those outside of research programmes.
