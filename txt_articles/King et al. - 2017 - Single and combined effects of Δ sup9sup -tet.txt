BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
The non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) can affect the pharmacological effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC). We tested the possible synergy between CBD and THC in decreasing mechanical sensitivity in a mouse model of paclitaxel-
induced neuropathic pain. We also tested the effects of CBD on oxaliplatin- and vincristine-induced mechanical sensitivity.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
Paclitaxel-treated mice (8.0 mg·kg�1 i.p., days 1, 3, 5 and 7) were pretreated with CBD (0.625–20.0 mg·kg�1 i.p.), THC
(0.625–20.0 mg·kg�1 i.p.) or CBD + THC (0.04 + 0.04–20.0 + 20.0 mg·kg�1 i.p.), and mechanical sensitivity was assessed on days
9, 14 and 21. Oxaliplatin-treated (6.0 mg·kg�1 i.p., day 1) or vincristine-treated mice (0.1 mg·kg�1 i.p. days 1–7) were pretreated
with CBD (1.25–10.0 mg·kg�1 i.p.), THC (10.0 mg·kg�1 i.p.) or THC + CBD (0.16 mg·kg�1 THC + 0.16 mg·kg�1 CBD i.p.).
KEY RESULTS
Both CBD and THC alone attenuated mechanical allodynia in mice treated with paclitaxel. Very low ineffective doses of CBD and
THC were synergistic when given in combination. CBD also attenuated oxaliplatin- but not vincristine-induced mechanical
sensitivity, while THC significantly attenuated vincristine- but not oxaliplatin-induced mechanical sensitivity. The low dose
combination significantly attenuated oxaliplatin- but not vincristine-induced mechanical sensitivity.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
CBD may be potent and effective at preventing the development of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, and its
clinical use may be enhanced by co-administration of low doses of THC. These treatment strategies would increase the therapeutic
window of cannabis-based pharmacotherapies.

 Introduction
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a se-
rious dose-limiting adverse effect associated with several com-
monly used chemotherapeutic agents, including taxanes,
platinum agents and vinca alkaloids. The exact mechanism
of CIPN has not been fully elucidated and can differ across
classes of chemotherapeutic agents. In general, these agents
probably initiate toxicity by affecting cellular microtubules,
disrupting mitochondrial function and/or impairing DNA
synthesis. These assaults on peripheral nerves can lead to
peripheral and central nitroxidative stress and inflamma-
tion, sensitization and spontaneous activity of peripheral
nerve fibres and hyperexcitability in the dorsal column of
the spinal cord (Hu and McLachlan, 2002), leading to
ascending pain pathway sensitization (Peters et al., 2007).
In most cases, CIPN is only partly reversible with cessation
of treatment and, in the worst cases, damage can be perma-
nent. To date, no one drug or drug class is considered to be
safe and effective for treatment of CIPN (Lynch et al., 2004).
It is therefore necessary to identify novel therapies to pre-
vent or treat CIPN.
Cannabinoids suppress neuropathic pain induced by
traumatic nerve injury, toxic insults and metabolic changes
(Guindon and Hohmann, 2008). We have recently reported
that the non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid cannabidiol
(CBD)
prevents
the
development
of
paclitaxel-induced
mechanical sensitivity in mice (Ward et al., 2011; Ward et al.,
2014). The mixed CB1/ CB2 receptor agonist WIN55,212 also
attenuates paclitaxel- and vincristine-induced neuropathic
pain through both CB1 and CB2 receptor mechanisms
(Pascual et al., 2005; Rahn et al., 2007), while selective CB2
receptor
agonism
has
also
been
shown
to
attenuate
cisplatin- and paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain (Deng
et al., 2012). While several of CBD’s overt effects are similar
to cannabinoids acting at CB1 and/or CB2 receptors, such as
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), CBD has very low affinity
for these receptors. Instead, CBD interacts with several other
receptors
and
intracellular
messengers
that
have
been
identified as targets for its pharmacological effects. For
example, we demonstrated that agonism at the 5-HT1A
receptor
may
underlie
CBD’s
protective
effect
against
development of paclitaxel-induced mechanical sensitivity,
as its protective effect was lost in the presence of the 5-HT1A
receptor antagonist WAY100635, but not the CB1 receptor
antagonist
SR141716
or
the
CB2
receptor
antagonist
SR144528 (Ward et al., 2014). Others have identified a role
for the activation of TRPV1 channels (Comelli et al., 2008)
and suppression of ROS and other inflammatory mediators
(Costa et al., 2007) in the attenuation of CIPN by CBD, in
rodent models.
Therefore, while CBD and cannabinoid receptor ago-
nists both attenuate chemotherapy-induced neuropathic
pain in rodent models, these agents are likely to work
through different sites of action. This suggests that when
co-administered, these compounds may interact in a man-
ner that deviates from additive, supporting the commonly
held ‘entourage effect’ concept that components of the
marijuana plant interact synergistically in producing there
pharmacological effects. Such potential interactions between
the phytocannabinoids CBD and THC have been investigated
since the 1970s in a range of animal models and with
mixed results. By and large, these studies have focused on
the ‘tetrad’ ofcannabinoid effects (catalepsy, locomotor ac-
tivity, hypothermia and antinociception). These are classi-
cal
CB1
receptor-mediated
behavioural
pharmacological
effects, reliably measured in rodents (Smith et al., 1994)
that are typically not observed after administration of CBD.
Therefore, these experiments are characterizing whether inef-
fective doses of CBD have no effect, increase or decrease, the
effects of THC on these behaviours. Moderate to high doses
of CBD, which are ineffective on their own, had no effect
(Jones and Pertwee, 1972; Ham and De Jong, 1975), increased
(Varvel et al., 2006; Hayakawa et al., 2008) or decreased
(Welburn et al., 1976; Formukong et al., 1988) tetrad behav-
iours with little consistency between studies. Most pertinent
to the present experiments, moderate to high (10–50 mg·kg�1)
doses of CBD, lacking antinociceptive effects on their own,
did increase the antinociceptive potency of THC, while lower
doses (e.g. 3 mg·kg�1) did not (Karniol and Carlini, 1973;
Varvel et al., 2006; Hayakawa et al., 2008). However, to our
knowledge, no published studies have determined whether
effective anti-neuropathic doses of CBD and THC alone inter-
act in an additive, synergistic or subadditive manner when
combined. The drug Sativex (Nabixomols), a defined extract
of the Cannabis plant that contains THC, CBD and a range

 of non-cannabinoid chemicals native to the plant, was devel-
oped by GWPharma based on the tenet that the combination
of THC, CBD and other chemicals in cannabis-based medici-
nal extracts may produce a therapeutic effect greater than
the sum of its parts. This is an exciting notion that needs to
be empirically tested.
In the present set of experiments, we examined if the
mixed CB1/CB2 receptor agonist THC was as potent and
efficacious as CBD in preventing paclitaxel-induced mechan-
ical sensitivity alone and if the combination of CBD and THC
produced synergistic effects. We also tested the efficacy of
selected doses of CBD, THC and in combination, to prevent
mechanical sensitivity following oxaliplatin or vincristine
administration.
Methods
Animals
All animal care and experimental procedures complied with
the guidelines of the Temple University Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee and were as humane as possible.
Animal studies are reported in compliance with the ARRIVE
guidelines (Kilkenny et al., 2010; McGrath & Lilley, 2015)
and US NIH guidelines for reporting experiments involving
animals. The total number of animals used was 344.
Male C57Bl6 mice weighing 18–20 g (Taconic Farms,
Cranbury NJ, USA) were acclimatized to the temperature-
and humidity-controlled vivarium and housed in groups of
four for at least 5 days before initiation of the study. Mice
were housed under a reverse 12 h light/dark cycle (lights off
9:00 h), with access to food and water ad libitum. Following
experimentation, all mice were killed by CO2 asphyxiation.
Mechanical allodynia
Paclitaxel study.
Baseline sensitivity to mechanical stimuli
was
assessed
prior
to
drug
treatment
using
von
Frey
monofilaments (0.07–2.0 g) and the up-down method, as
described previously (Ward et al., 2011; Ward et al., 2014).
Chemotherapeutic agents, cannabinoid compounds and/or
vehicle were then administered on experimental days 1, 3, 5
and 7. Paclitaxel was given at a dose of 8.0 mg·kg�1 per
injection. Fifteen minutes prior to paclitaxel injection, mice
were first pretreated with vehicle or a range of CBD
(0.625–20 mg·kg�1), THC (0.625–20 mg·kg�1) or CBD + THC
combination (0.04 + 0.04–20.0 + 20.0 mg·kg�1) doses.
Mechanical sensitivity was reassessed on days 9, 14 and 21.
Three paclitaxel + vehicle groups were tested throughout the
duration of the study: one alongside the CBD dose–response
groups, one alongside the THC dose–response groups and
one alongside the combination groups, to ensure that the
effect of paclitaxel remained consistent throughout the
course of the study.
Oxaliplatin study.
Baseline sensitivity to mechanical stimuli
was assessed prior to drug treatment in mice as described
above. A dose of 6 mg·kg�1 oxaliplatin was administered
once. CBD (1.25–10.0 mg·kg�1), THC (10.0 mg·kg�1) or
THC + CBD (0.16 mg·kg�1 THC + 0.16 mg·kg�1 CBD) was
administered 15 min prior to the single oxaliplatin injection.
Mechanical sensitivity was reassessed on days 2, 4, 7 and 10.
Vincristine study.
Baseline sensitivity to mechanical stimuli
was assessed prior to drug treatment in mice as described above.
A dose of 0.1 mg·kg�1·day�1 vincristine was administered once
daily for 7 days. CBD (1.25–10.0 mg·kg�1), THC (10.0 mg·kg�1)
or THC + CBD (0.16 mg·kg�1 THC + 0.16 mg·kg�1 CBD) was
administered 15 min prior to each vincristine injection.
Mechanical sensitivity was reassessed on days 5, 10, 15 and 22.
Mice were randomized to their treatment groups, and all
behavioural experimenters were blinded to the treatment
conditions of the mice during behavioural testing. One
experimenter placed the mice in the allodynia testing cubbies
for habituation, while the other experimenter conducted
allodynia testing procedure outside the room. Mice are used
because they are a common species used for this model, and
we have used them in our CIPN research for the past decade.
Sample sizes were n = 6–12 per group for all studies (n = 12 for
combination experiment due to higher variability in the
combination data), based on our and others’ past results.
Dosing regimens for each chemotherapeutic agent differ
based on the optimal dosing regimens to produce reliable
and robust mechanical sensitivity based on published data
from rodent models.
Data and statistical analysis
The
data
and
statistical
analysis
comply
with
the
recommendations on experimental design and analysis in
pharmacology (Curtis et al., 2015). For statistical analyses
and graphical presentation of data, a percent baseline
sensitivity value for each mouse is calculated and the mean
percent baseline sensitivity (±SEM) was determined for each
treatment group. Baseline sensitivity for each mouse was
calculated as their sensitivity threshold value on test day di-
vided
by
their
sensitivity
threshold
value
at
baseline
multiplied by 100. Therefore, 100% baseline sensitivity
represents no development of mechanical sensitivity follow-
ing treatment, with lower % values equating to the de-
velopment
of
increasing
sensitivity
to
mechanical
stimulation.
One-way
repeated
measures
ANOVAs
and
Dunnett’s post hoc comparisons (GraphPad Prism 6) were used
to determine doses significantly different from vehicle treat-
ment. P < 0.05 was used as the limit of statistical significance.
Additionally, in order to determine dose-effect levels of
the ascending limb of the CBD and THC dose-effect curves,
as well as the CBD + THC dose combinations, for dose-
equivalence analyses (see below), paclitaxel data from day
14 for each animal were also transformed into percent
maximum possible effect (%MPE ±SEM). To determine
%MPE for each mouse, the relevant paclitaxel group’s
percent baseline value is subtracted from the mouse’s
percent baseline value, as the paclitaxel effect will repre-
sent 0% MPE. In addition, a scaling multiplier is calculated
by subtracting the paclitaxel group’s percent baseline value
from 100% and multiplying dividing this number into 100.
The final calculation for each mouse is as follows: (percent
baseline value � paclitaxel percent baseline value) × (100/
100-paclitaxel baseline value). For example, on day 14,
the
first-run
paclitaxel
percent
baseline
average
was
39.8%. The percent baseline sensitivity of a mouse in the

 2.5 mg·kg�1 CBD group on day 14 was 71.4%. The above
formula was used to determine the %MPE for that mouse
(52.4%) when the paclitaxel value was set to 0%. Derived
values exceeding 100% were capped at 100%, and derived
values in the negative were assigned 0%. Linear regression
analysis (GraphPad Prism 6) was then used to determine
the ED50 values for the ascending limb of the CBD, THC
and CBD + THC dose–response curves.
Dose-equivalence analysis was used to predict the com-
bined effects of CBD and THC, administered in a 1:1 ratio,
based on their effects alone on the ascending limbs of their
dose response curves. Briefly, in dose-equivalence analysis,
for each CBD dose, an effect-equivalent dose of THC is
identified. This matched THC dose is added to the actual
THC dose in each combination to be tested so that the sum
is the predicted effective dose for that combination. The test
for significance for the difference between the predicted
additive effect level (Eadd) and the actual effect level observed
(Eobs) is based on Student’s t distribution (see Tallarida, 2000,
Tallarida, 2012) for details).
Materials
Paclitaxel solution (Teva Parenteral Medicines, dissolved in
1:1 mixture of alcohol and Cremophor), oxaliplatin (Teva
Parenteral Medicines) and vincristine (Hospira Worldwide)
were purchased from the Temple University Pharmacy (Phil-
adelphia, PA, USA). Paclitaxel was then diluted with sterile sa-
line to 0.8 mg·mL�1. Oxaliplatin was dissolved in water to a
concentration of 0.6 mg·mL�1. Vincristine was dissolved in
saline to a concentration of 0.01 mg·mL�1. Laboratory-syn-
thesized CBD was provided by INSYS Therapeutics, Inc. (Aus-
tin, TX) and THC was provided by the National Institute on
Drug Abuse drug supply programme (Bethesda, MD, USA).
CBD and THC were dissolved in a mixture of ethyl alcohol,
Cremophor and saline; 1:1:18, v/v. All agents were injected
i.p. in a volume of 10 μL·g�1 of body weight. For combination
testing, CBD and THC were dissolved together into a single
solution and administered by a single injection.
Results
Reproducibility of paclitaxel-induced
mechanical sensitivity
As we have reported previously, administration of pacli-
taxel (8.0 mg·kg�1 per injection, administered on experi-
mental days 1, 3, 5 and 7) produced robust and reliable
mechanical sensitivity in C57Bl/6 mice (Figure 1). This
effect lasted for at least 21 days post-initiation of adminis-
tration with peak allodynic effects occurring between days
9 and 14. Because of the long duration of the study,
multiple paclitaxel + vehicle groups were run to determine
that paclitaxel administration was producing a consistent
level of mechanical sensitivity across all phases of CBD
and THC alone and combination testing.
Dose-response effects of CBD or THC on
paclitaxel-induced mechanical sensitivity
Treatment with either CBD (Figure 2A) or THC (Figure 2B)
produced a biphasic, dose-related attenuation of paclitaxel-
induced mechanical sensitivity. For CBD treated groups,
analysis of the results from day 9 with one-way ANOVA indi-
cated a significant effect of CBD treatment [F(8, 62) = 4.566].
Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test indicated significant
effects of the 1.0 and 20 mg·kg�1 doses of CBD. For the results
from day 14, one-way ANOVA indicated a significant effect of
CBD
treatment
[F(8,
62)
=
2.693]
Dunnett’s
multiple
comparisons test indicated significant effects of the 1.0 and
20 mg·kg�1 doses of CBD. Analysis of the results from day
21 indicated no significant effect of CBD treatment [one-
way ANOVA; F(8, 62) < 1.0].
For the THC treated groups, analysis of the results from
day 9 indicated a significant effect of THC treatment [one-
way ANOVA ; F(7, 56) = 3.819]. Dunnett’s multiple compari-
sons test indicated significant effect of the 2.5 and 10 mg·kg�1
doses of THC. Results from day 14 indicated a significant effect
of THC treatment [one-way ANOVA F(7, 56) = 2.810] and
Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test indicated significant ef-
fect of the 10 mg·kg�1 dose of THC. For Day 21, one-way
ANOVA indicated a nearly significant effect of THC treatment
[F(7, 56) = 2.104, P = 0.058].
Dose-response effects of CBD + THC
combination on paclitaxel-induced mechanical
sensitivity
Treatment with CBD + THC in a 1:1 ratio based on dose
produced a biphasic, dose-related attenuation of paclitaxel-
induced mechanical sensitivity (Figure 3). This effect was
more potent than either agent given alone. Analysis of the
results from CBD + THC treatment on day 14, indicated a
significant effect of CBD + THC treatment [one-way ANOVA;
F(10, 113) = 2.576,] and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test
indicated a statistically significant effect of the combined
0.31 mg·kg�1 (0.16 mg·kg�1 CBD + 0.16 mg·kg�1 THC) dose
compared with paclitaxel treatment alone. We focused on
the day 14 combination effect because this is the time point
of peak allodynia, but the combination treatments at days 9

Comparison of single, compared with
combined, phytocannabinoid treatment on
paclitaxel-induced mechanical sensitivity
To determine whether the 1:1 CBD + THC combination
produced protective effects in the CIPN model that deviated
from simple additivity, predicted effect levels for these dose
combinations were first determined from the dose effects
of each agent alone. To do this, raw data for each animal
from the initial ascending limbs of the CBD and THC
dose-response curves (0.625–2.5 mg·kg�1) were transformed
into %MPE values, as described in the Methods. Linear
regression analysis of the ascending limb indicated an
ED50 for CBD of 1.014 mg·kg�1 and for THC of 1.8 mg·kg�1
(Figure 4A, B). To determine the predicted additive effect of
doses of CBD and THC given in a 1:1 ratio, effect levels of
each dose/drug in the combination were determined using
the following dose effect equations derived for each for each
drug: E ¼ 78:47D2:5
D2:5þ0:497 for CBD and E ¼
80D3
D3þ3:44 for THC. These
effect levels were added together to determine the Eadd for
each dose combination tested (Figure 4C). The Eadds were
then compared graphically and statistically to the actual

Effect of CBD on oxaliplatin-induced
mechanical sensitivity
The effect of CBD (1.25–10.0 mg·kg�1 i.p.) on oxaliplatin-
induced mechanical sensitivity was tested in 40 male
C57Bl/6 mice. Two-way ANOVA indicated a significant
effect
of

and

[F(4140) = 4.260,]. There was no significant interaction
between time and treatment [F(12, 140) = 1.239 (Figure 5A)
and Dunnett’s post test indicated no specific significant dif-
ferences for any dose of CBD, compared with oxaliplatin
alone. The effect of 10.0 mg·kg�1 THC was also tested in a
separate group of animals, and two-way ANOVA indicated a
significant effect of time [F(3, 48) = 5.780] and a non-significant
attenuated mechanical sensitivity [F(1, 48) = 2.912] (Figure 5B).
The effect of the low dose combination 0.16 mg·kg�1
THC + 0.16 mg·kg�1 CBD produced a significant effect of
treatment [F(1, 48) = 7.180] and of time [F(3, 48) = 7.155]
(Figure 5C).
Effect of CBD on vincristine-induced
mechanical sensitivity
The effect of CBD (1.25–10.0 mg·kg�1 ip) on vincristine-in-
duced mechanical sensitivity was tested in 40 additional
male C57Bl/6 mice. Two-way ANOVA indicated a signifi-
cant effect of time [F(3, 140) = 32.00] but not of treatment
[F(4, 140) = 1.163] (Figure 5D). The effect of 10.0 mg·kg�1
THC was also tested in a separate group of animals, and
two-way ANOVA indicated a significant effect of treatment
[F(1,
56) = 18.82] (Figure 5E). The low dose combination
(0.16 mg·kg�1 THC + 0.16 mg·kg�1 CBD) did not attenuate
vincristine-induced mechanical sensitivity [F(1,56) = 1.550]
(Figure 5F).
Discussion
Previously, we have already demonstrated that pretreatment
with the phytocannabinoid CBD prevented the development
of behavioural symptoms of CIPN in a mouse mode (Ward et
al., 2011, 2014). The main objectives of the present study were
to demonstrate whether the primary phytocannabinoid THC
shows similar potency and efficacy in the mouse CIPN model
and to determine if CBD and THC interact in a manner deviat-
ing from additivity in this model. This is important because,
while the entourage effects of cannabinoids working together
as more than a sum of their parts have been anecdotally
discussed at length, few rigorous studies have been executed
to demonstrate such a phenomenon. These data in the pres-
ent study were subjected to equivalence analyses to quantita-
tively
determine
whether
the
two
dominant
phytocannabinoids can work synergistically to prevent the
development of neuropathic pain in a mouse model of CIPN.
Initially, it was critical to determine the relative potency of
each compound alone to produce comparable anti-allodynic
effects. As shown in Figure 2, both phytocannabinoids show
very similar triphasic dose–response curves with two apparent
peaks in efficacy, one within a dose range of 1.0–2.5 mg·kg�1
and the other within the 10–20 mg·kg�1 range. Biphasic
effects of cannabinoids have been reported (Grisham and
Ferraro, 1972; Kwiatkowska et al., 2004; Margulies and
Hammer, 1991), and one study has reported triphasic effects
of THC on locomotor activity across a wide range of doses
(Sanudo-Pena et al., 2000). In female mice dosed daily with
CBD for 14 days, paclitaxel-induced mechanical sensitivity
was attenuated at the 10 mg·kg�1 dose but not the 5.0 mg·kg�1
dose (Ward et al., 2011). In a follow-up experiment, female
mice were treated with CBD (2.5 or 5.0 mg·kg�1) only prior
to each paclitaxel injection (days 1, 3, 5 and 7), and both
CBD doses attenuated the development of paclitaxel-induced
mechanical sensitivity, but through a 5-HT1A but not a CB1
or CB2 receptor-mediated mechanism (Ward et al., 2014).
Our present results with synthetic CBD (manufactured by
INSYS Rx) showed that doses as low as 1.0 mg·kg�1 i.p. fully
blocked the development of mechanical sensitivity, follow-
ing paclitaxel administration in male mice. Taken together,
potency differences we have obtained with CBD in the CIPN
model may be dependent on sex as has been determined
with THC (Tseng et al., 2004) or on source of compound.
In the present study, efficacy was again observed at 10 and
20 mg·kg�1 i.p., showing a triphasic dose–response curve.

 Such effects of these higher doses have also been reported in
other pain (Costa et al., 2004; Ward et al., 2011) and CNS in-
jury models (Kwiatkoski et al., 2012). The reason(s) underly-
ing these triphasic effects need to be further examined. One
possibility, made more plausible by the fact that CBD has
such a range of putative therapeutic sites of action, is that

 mechanisms. For example, we have previously demon-
strated that the anti-neuropathic effects of CBD (5.0 mg·kg�1
every other day for 4 days) may be mediated by agonist
activity at the 5-HT1A receptor, while Comelli et al. (2008)
reported that these effects of CBD (10.0 mg·kg�1 daily for
14 days) may be mediated by the TRPV1 cation channel.
In the present model, THC produced triphasic effects,
comparable to those observed for CBD. The 2.5 mg·kg�1 dose
of THC fully blocked the development of mechanical
sensitivity following paclitaxel administration, as did higher
doses of 10 and 20 mg·kg�1. It is unlikely that motor impair-
ment was responsible for these high dose effects of THC, as
the final cannabinoid doses were given on day 7 and anti-
allodynic responses were measured up to day 21. We are
unaware of a comprehensive preclinical study demonstrating
dose–response effects of the partial CB1/CB2 receptor agonist
THC in a rodent model of neuropathic pain, which is
surprising given that targeting CB1 and CB2 receptors to
produce antinociception and anti-inflammation, respec-
tively, has been investigated extensively in animal models.
Previous studies demonstrated that full agonists at CB1 (Vera
et al., 2013) and CB2 receptors (Deng et al., 2015) can attenu-
ate chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain, but the pri-
mary mechanism of action of the partial mixed CB1/ CB2
receptor
agonist
THC
in
this
model
remains
to
be
determined. Taken together, these experiments reveal that
CBD and THC are roughly equipotent and equi-effective at
preventing
the
development
of
mechanical
sensitivity
induced by paclitaxel administration.
For the next phase of the study, a dose-equivalence
analysis experimental design (where combinations are paired
by dose), as opposed to a dose-addition analysis design
(where combinations are paired by effect level), was imple-
mented to model the cannabis extract Sativex, which con-
tains nearly equal amounts of THC (2.7 mg) and CBD
(2.5 mg) per spray delivery. When equal dose pairs of THC
and CBD were administered to mice receiving paclitaxel, the
cannabinoid combination treatment was more potent than
either CBD or THC treatment alone. A combined dose of
0.32 mg·kg�1 (0.16 mg·kg�1 THC: 0.16 mg·kg�1 CBD) was
fully effective at preventing paclitaxel-induced mechanical
sensitivity 14 days after initiation of drug administration.
Linear regression analyses revealed an ED50 of 1.014 mg·kg�1
for CBD and for THC, an ED50 of 1.8 mg·kg�1 and, for
the combination THC + CBD, a much decreased ED50 of
0.142
mg·kg�1.
Interestingly,
the
combined
dose-effect
curve also maintained its triphasic dose response function.
These results reveal a significant interaction between THC
and CBD and demonstrate for the first time quantitatively
that these phytocannabinoids act in a synergistic manner
to exert shared physiological effects, in this case to prevent
the development of neuropathic pain in a rodent model.
As mentioned in the Introduction, several previous studies
have investigated the effect of predominantly ineffective
doses of CBD on established behavioural pharmacological
effects of THC. In mice alone, results have pointed to a
lack of interaction, a potentiation of THC effects or an at-
tenuation of THC effects across studies, even on the same
behavioural endpoint [e.g. catalepsy (Jones and Pertwee,
1972; Karniol and Carlini, 1973; Ham and De Jong, 1975;
Formukong
et
al.,
1988;
Hayakawa
et
al.,
2008)].
Specifically regarding pain, interaction studies have been
carried out again in rodent models, showing that CBD was
ineffective,
with
findings
that
CBD
can
increase
the
antinociceptive potency of THC (Varvel et al., 2006) but it
decreased the attenuation of formic acid-induced writhing
by THC (Welburn et al., 1976). Because previous reports
have focused on relatively high doses of CBD in animal
models, where CBD is typically ineffective, it is difficult to
compare the present degree of observed synergy with these
earlier studies. Overall, our present synergistic results are
critical because they demonstrate and reinforce several key
points. Firstly, the effects of the interactions between
phytocannabinoids, be they additive, synergistic or sub-ad-
ditive, are highly dependent on the physiological endpoint.
Secondly, ultra-low doses of these phytocannabinoids may
be effective in clinical populations for the treatment of neu-
ropathic pain, allowing for a more favourable therapeutic
index with reduced adverse effects. Finally, THC and CBD
are
likely
to
be
working
through
separate,
facilitative
mechanisms of action which, if elucidated, could lead to
the development of a wider class of safe and effective anti-
neuropathic pharmacotherapies. It is generally recognized
now that the initial receptor sites of action of these two
compounds are distinct. As mentioned, the effects of THC
in this model could be mediated by CB1, CB2 or both recep-
tor subtypes. Regarding CBD, a role for 5-HT1A receptors
(Ward et al., 2014), glycine channels (Xiong et al., 2014) or
TRPV1 channels (Costa et al., 2004),among others, have
been shown to be involved in the anti-neuropathic actions
of CBD. The present synergistic results suggest that co-acti-
vation by CND and THC of these distinct sites leads either
to increased potency of these compounds to stimulate their
intracellular signalling pathways or to the stimulation of
alternative
pathways
that
are
not
activated
by
either
compound alone. Moreover, these interactions could occur
by CBD and THC activating separate receptors on the same
cell types, or by co-modulating distinct cell types. The cell
types primarily responsible for these anti-neuropathic and
anti-inflammatory effects include not only neurons, but also
microglia, astrocytes and/or other cell types associated with
the immune system. These possibilities provide for a range
of experimental approaches and directions in order to
elucidate possible mechanisms at the cellular, receptor
and signalling levels. Lastly, changes in pharmacokinetics
of each compound may also play a role in the increased
potency of the combination, as some have found that
CBD can decrease THC metabolism and increase plasma
and brain THC levels (Jones and Pertwee, 1972; Bornheim
et al., 1995).
To further our understanding of the anti-allodynic
efficacy of CBD, THC and their combination, we examined
whether CBD treatment would lead to protection from
mechanical
sensitivity
resulting
from
two
additional
chemotherapeutic agents, oxaliplatin and vincristine. This
suggestion of selectivity is also important to consider given
the different mechanisms of action of oxaliplatin, vincristine
and paclitaxel in their chemotherapeutic and chemotoxic
effects. Differential effects of cannabinoids on these various
induced neuropathies might speak to the generalization of a
treatment class across chemotoxic neuropathies and to more
distinct mechanisms of action of CBD, THC and their

 combination, as they relate to specific chemotoxic neuropa-
thies. Our results to date suggest that CBD is effective at
preventing oxaliplatin-induced mechanical sensitivity, but
the dose–response relationship is shifted to the right, again
suggesting a different mechanism of action of CBD (and
perhaps oxaliplatin) in this model. One reported difference
between these chemotherapeutic agents in the preclinical
models is the involvement of non-neuronal cell types in
CIPN.
For
example,
there
are
reports
that
paclitaxel
administration is associated with microglial activation in
the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (Pevida et al. 2013) and
infiltration of T-cells into the dorsal root ganglia, whereas
oxaliplatin activated spinal astrocytes but not microglia
(Robinson et al., 2014).THC at 10 mg·kg�1 produced a non-
significant attenuation of oxaliplatin-induced mechanical
sensitivity, and perhaps more importantly, we again observed
a very potent, significant effect of the low dose combination
0.16 mg·kg�1 THC + 0.16 mg·kg�1 CBD. Interestingly, CBD
was ineffective at preventing vincristine-induced mechanical
sensitivity. It should be noted that in the vincristine/CBD
experiment, vincristine induced a much more profound
percent baseline effect on mechanical allodynia than that
observed with paclitaxel and oxaliplatin, so the lack of CBD
efficacy after vincristine may be due to an insurmountable
level of neuropathy in these mice. THC at 10 mg·kg�1 was
also effective at preventing vincristine-induced mechanical
sensitivity, while in this case, the low dose combination
(0.16 mg·kg�1 THC + 0.16 mg·kg�1 CBD) did not attenuate
it. This may again be due to different underlying mechanisms
for sensory sensitivity induced by the different chemothera-
peutic agents, with some mechanistic targets being less
sensitive to CBD or combined treatment than others.
In summary, these experiments demonstrate quantita-
tively for the first time that CBD and THC work synergisti-
cally to prevent the development of neuropathic pain
using a mouse model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral
neuropathy. We and others identified more than one non-
cannabinoid
receptor-mediated
mechanisms
underlying
the efficacy of CBD in this model, while related data suggest
that THC is likely to act through CB1 and CB2 receptors in
this assay. Further work is warranted to determine the mech-
anism of synergy between THC and CBD, from the cellular
to receptor to intracellular signalling level, to enhance our
ability to develop novel safe and effective treatment strate-
gies for CIPN and other neuropathic pain disorders.
