SUMMARY
For many enveloped viruses, binding to a receptor(s) on a host cell acts as a first step in a series of 
events culminating in fusion with the host cell membrane and transfer of genetic material for 
replication [for review see1,2]. The envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer on the surface of HIV is 
responsible for receptor binding and fusion. While Env can tolerate a high degree of mutation in 
five variable regions (V1-V5), and also at N-linked glycosylation sites that contribute roughly half 
the mass of Env, the functional sites for recognition of receptor CD4 and co-receptor CXCR4/
CCR5 are conserved and essential for viral fitness. Soluble SOSIP Env trimers are structural and

 antigenic mimics of the pre-fusion native, surface-presented Env3,4, targets of broadly neutralizing 
antibodies (bnAbs). Thus, they are attractive immunogens for vaccine development [for review 
see5–8]. Here we present high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) structures of subtype 
B B41 SOSIP Env trimers in complex with CD4 and antibody 17b, or with antibody b12, at 
resolutions of ~3.7 Å and ~3.6 Å, respectively, and compare them to cryoEM reconstructions of 
ligand-free B41 SOSIP Env trimers or in complex with either CD4 or CD4bs antibody PGV04, at 
~5.6 Å, ~5.2 Å and ~7.4 Å, respectively. Consequently, we present the most complete description 
and understanding of the CD4/17b-induced intermediate and provide the molecular basis of the 
receptor-binding induced conformational change required for HIV-1 entry into host cells. Both 
CD4 and b12 induce large, previously uncharacterized conformational rearrangements in the gp41 
subunits, and the fusion peptide becomes more buried in a newly formed pocket. These structures 
provide key details on the biological function of the type I viral fusion machine from HIV-1 as 
well as new templates for inhibitor design.
Numerous biophysical studies have provided a framework for CD4-induced Env 
conformational changes through a combination of low-resolution cryo-electron tomography 
of membrane-embedded trimers9,10, x-ray crystallography of gp120 monomers11, and more 
recently hydrogen/deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS)12 and Förster 
resonance energy transfer (FRET)13 experiments into the dynamics of Env (see 
Supplementary Discussion for more details). To study the molecular basis of conformational 
changes resulting from binding of receptor to HIV-1 Env, we obtained a cryoEM map of 
fully glycosylated B41 SOSIP.66414 (a solubilized and stabilized version of Env) in complex 
with two-domain soluble CD4 (sCD4) and the CD4-induced antibody 17b at ~3.7 Å 
resolution (B41CD4/17b) (Fig. 1a; Extended Data Fig. 1; Extended Data Table 1). We also 
obtained a ~5.6 Å cryoEM map of ligand-free subtype B B41 SOSIP.664 (B41LF) and show 
it to be structurally comparable to subtype A BG505 (Extended Data Fig. 2c–f). Like BG505 
SOSIP.664, B41 SOSIP.664 is a stable, native-like trimer that induced autologous 
neutralizing antibody responses in rabbit immunization studies15 but can adopt slightly more 
open conformations (partially open) when analyzed by negative-stain EM, and has a lower 
melting temperature compared to BG50514,16 (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Despite differences 
in their biophysical properties, the structure of B41LF (Extended Data Fig. 2f) adopts a 
closed, pre-fusion conformation nearly identical to the analogous BG505 SOSIP.664 
structure (PDB 4ZMJ)17.
Our structure of B41CD4/17b elucidates the molecular details of receptor-induced 
conformational changes, including rearrangements of the V1/V2 and V3 loops, and never-
seen-before changes in gp41, including repositioning of the fusion peptide (Fig. 1b; SI Video 
1). In our B41CD4/17b cryoEM map that contains the complete gp120, most of V1/V2 that 
extends parallel to CD4 is disordered in the region that was truncated in the core gp120 
construct used for crystallography (residues C131 to N187) (Extended Data Fig. 3b). 
Despite the presence of 17b, whose epitope overlaps the co-receptor binding site, much of 
the V3 loop beyond the base is also disordered.
CD4/17b binding induces subtle changes in a network of conserved residues (>96% of 
sequences in the Los Alamos database) in the gp120 core similar to previous observations in 
Ozorowski et al.

 gp120 monomers11,18–20 (Fig. 2a; SI Video 2; Extended Data Table 2). These changes 
propagate across gp120 to the C1 region (residues 63–72; α0), which is poorly ordered in 
pre-fusion Env trimer structures (Fig. 1b; Fig. 2c). α0 adopts a stable alpha-helical 
conformation via transit into a pocket that was sterically occluded by the close juxtaposition 
of gp120 and HR1 in gp41 in the closed, pre-fusion trimer (Extended Data Fig 3d; SI Video 
3). An additional rearrangement of two mannose residues in the D1 arm of the highly 
conserved N262 glycan into a new pocket underneath the base of V3 further stabilizes the 
helical conformation of α0 and establishes a direct link between the co-receptor binding site 
and gp41 (Fig. 2c; Extended Data Fig. 4c). Due to the rotation of gp120, α0 now caps the 
HR1 helix (α7) of the gp41 subunit from a neighboring protomer, which was previously 
capped by α1 in gp120 from within a protomer (Fig. 2b). The functional role of α0 that we 
describe here supports a different conclusion than one based on a recently published low-
resolution structure of CD4 bound to an Env trimer in a closed conformation claiming that 
CD4 makes specific contacts with C1 in the adjacent protomer21. In our structure, all of the 
highly conserved residues claimed to interact with CD4 during its initial pose form intra-
gp120 stabilizing interactions in the open CD4-bound structure presented here (Fig. 3d). 
Mutation of these residues lead to a loss of infectivity21; in light of the present work, likely 
due to destabilization of the conformation competent for co-receptor binding.
Additional cryoEM reconstructions were produced to test the effect of sCD4 alone on Env 
conformational changes, and compare a with a different Env genotype, BG505 (Extended 
Data Fig. 1d). Within the limits of resolution we observed only slight differences, whether 
B41 or BG505 SOSIP was used, and whether 17b is present or not (Extended Data Fig. 3c, 
Extended Data Fig. 4d). The V3 loop remains unresolved in reconstructions of B41 or 
BG505 SOSIP in complex with sCD4, suggesting that sCD4 alone is responsible for the 
gp120 rearrangements and exposure of the co-receptor site, and suggesting that 17b does not 
induce further conformational changes (Extended Data Fig. 4f).
VRC01-class antibodies22 bind the CD4bs but do not induce global conformational changes 
in the Env trimer while another CD4bs neutralizing antibody, b12, has been shown to engage 
Env in a different manner9,14,23. To better understand the conformational changes induced 
by b12, we generated cryoEM structures of B41 SOSIP.664 in complex with either CD4bs 
antibody PGV04 (B41PGV04) or b12 (B41b12) to resolutions of ~7.4 Å and ~3.6 Å, 
respectively (Fig. 4a; Extended Data Fig. 1; Extended Data Fig. 5a, c). While B41PGV04 was 
nearly identical to BG505 SOSIP.664 in complex with VRC01-like antibodies, B41b12 
promoted a large-scale change in Env away from the closed pre-fusion conformation similar 
to B41CD4/17b (Extended Data Fig. 5b, d, e). Specifically, B41b12 exhibits a large rigid body 
movement of all three gp120 subunits with respect to the trimer axis and concomitant 
rearrangement of the gp41 helices (discussed below) (Fig. 4c; Extended Data Fig. 5d). 
Despite the gp120 rearrangements, the V3 loop remains sequestered beneath V1/V2 and the 
co-receptor binding site is inaccessible (Fig. 4b; Extended Data Fig. 6b). Thus, while b12 
makes similar interactions with Env as CD4 it does not induce a conformational change in 
V1/V2 relative to gp120 (Fig. 4b; Extended Data Fig. 4e). Notably, the subtle rearrangement 
of mannose residues in the N262 glycan observed in B41CD4/17b is not seen in B41b12, and 
density for the α0 region is highly disordered. Thus, functional progression of the Env 
requires both a rigid body movement of gp120 and CD4-induced allosteric changes within

 gp120 to expose the co-receptor binding site. Unlike CD4, b12 is sterically occluded from 
binding the closed pre-fusion conformation of Env (Extended Data Fig. 4b; Extended Data 
Fig. 6c–f), suggesting that transient opening of the trimer is required for b12 epitope 
exposure. Upon binding, b12 prevents reversion back to the closed pre-fusion state 
(Extended Data Fig. 6d).
Globally, both CD4/17b and b12 result in gp41 rearrangements that, in the case of the 
former, prime for further transitions to facilitate fusion with the host-cell membrane. The 
HR1 three-helical bundle begins to open up at the base, causing the N-terminal half of the 
HR1 peptide (HR1N) to move away from the center of the trimer (Extended Data Fig. 7g). 
This movement coincides with formation of a stable helix in the fusion peptide proximal 
region (FPPR) and HR1N that packs against HR2 (Extended Data Fig. 7h). Additionally, 
gp120 C1 (V36-P43) and C5 (starting at I491) regions undergo a similar movement in the 
same direction to avoid clashing with α9b of HR2. Finally, HR2 tilts upward and, when 
modeled onto the surface of a virion, would be more perpendicular to and somewhat lifted 
off the membrane compared to the pre-fusion state.
One of the major consequences of the movement of gp120 relative to gp41 is the formation 
of a new pocket close to the trimer core that, in B41b12 and B41CD4/17b, houses the fusion 
peptide (FP). FP, which is fully resolved to the N-terminal residue A512 in B41b12 and L515 
B41CD4/17b, undergoes a large conformational rearrangement upon entry into this pocket 
(Fig. 3a, e; Extended Data Fig. 7c–e; SI Video 4), and is stabilized by many newly formed 
interactions. For example, K574, which forms a salt bridge with D107 of gp120 in the closed 
pre-fusion state, undoes this interaction upon translocation of α1 induced by CD4/17b-
binding, but forms a cation-π interaction with gp120 F53 (Fig. 3b; Extended Data Fig. 7a). 
All three residues (F53, D107, K574) are >99% conserved and the interplay between them 
likely contributes to two stable states (Extended Data Table 2). In fact, mutational analysis 
demonstrates that introduction of an F53A mutation not only decreases infectivity but also 
leads to greater gp120 shedding18,24. The gp120 interface with gp41 α7 in B41CD4/17b is 
further stabilized by highly conserved residues that do not make any productive interactions 
in the pre-fusion state (Fig. 3b). Finally, despite the larger conformational change, conserved 
phenylalanine residues in the FP and FPPR provide additional stabilizing interactions (Fig. 
3e). In addition to formation of new contacts, the intermediate state exemplified by 
B41CD4/17b also retains some stabilizing features of the closed pre-fusion state (Fig. 3c; 
Extended Data Fig. 7f). Altogether, this extensive network of interactions between highly 
conserved residues suggests that the CD4/17b-bound state represents a stable, fusion 
intermediate wherein the fusion peptide is embedded inside the trimer distant from the host 
membrane and therefore requiring further triggering by co-receptor engagement.
The Env trimer on the surface of HIV must maintain a fine balance between stability until a 
target cell is reached and the ability to trigger and undergo conformational rearrangement 
that drives fusion. Our studies describe Env, even when stabilized by SOSIP mutations, as a 
dynamic molecule that fluctuates between closed and open pre-fusion states. In the open 
conformation, we now see that the FP is structured and sequestered near the core of the 
trimer. We hypothesize that the FP may transition between solvent-exposed and sequestered 
conformations based on “breathing” in the trimer. The structure of FP in our b12- or

 CD4/17b-bound structures could therefore be used to inform structure-based design of 
stabilized or cyclic fusion peptide mimetic inhibitors of HIV25,26.
Finally, we show that CD4bs neutralizing antibodies can prevent exposure of the co-receptor 
binding site in both the open (e.g. b12) or closed conformation (e.g. VRC01) by restricting 
movement of the V1/V2 loops (Extended Data Fig. 8). CD4, on the other hand, induces a 
series of allosteric changes that propagate across gp120 and expose the co-receptor binding 
site. While the co-receptor binding site is accessible in the CD4-bound structure, it is unclear 
how further conformational changes in the trimer are triggered by interaction with CCR5/
CXCR4, although the glycan at N262 and formation of α0 likely play a role in signal 
transmission. Based on the disposition of the co-receptor binding sites three copies of 
CCR527 could bind to the trimer in this conformation. Interestingly, CCR5 forms a 
crystallographic dimer in the x-ray structure27 that when docked on top of our trimer 
structure spans across two gp120 subunits and could potentially interact with two co-
receptor binding sites simultaneously (Extended Data Fig. 8). Overall, our structural studies 
have unlocked the molecular details of the first step in the CD4 receptor-mediated fusion 
process of Env, but the role of the co-receptor remains to be elucidated.
Methods
Protein expression
BG505 SOSIP.664 and B41 SOSIP.664 trimers were expressed by transient transfection (co-
transfected with furin) in HEK293F (Invitrogen; mycoplasma-free) and purified as 
previously described using 2G12-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography28,29.
The two N-terminal domains of human CD4 were cloned into vector pHCMV3 with an N-
terminal Ig-kappa secretion signal and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag for expression in 
HEK293F. One liter of 293 Freestyle cells was transiently transfected with 0.5 mg of DNA. 
After 7 days, the supernatant containing the secreted protein was applied to a 5ml HisTrap 
FF column (GE Healthcare) at 1 ml/min. The protein was eluted with a gradient from 0–
100% of 1.5 M glycine in 0.02 M Tris-acetate pH 8.0, and 0.5 M NaCl. Peaks containing 
CD4 (as verified by SDS-PAGE) were pooled and further purified by size exclusion 
chromatography on an S75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) in 0.05 M Tris-acetate pH 8.0 and 
0.3 M NaCl.
PGV04, 17b or b12 Fab was expressed in HEK293F and purified by 5 mL KappaSelect or 
LambdaSelect affinity (GE Healthcare), MonoS 5/50 GL (GE Healthcare), and Superdex 
200 Increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare).
Sample preparation
BG505 SOSIP.664 were mixed with a 10X molar excess (sCD4:trimer) of sCD4 for 2 hr at 
room temperature. For complexes containing 17b, a subsequent incubation was performed 
with a 10X molar excess (Fab:trimer) of 17b Fab for 1 hr at room temperature. The complex 
was purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using Superose 6 10/300 GL (GE 
Healthcare) in TBS (0.05 M Tris pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl). The fractions containing the 
complex were pooled and concentrated using a 100-kDa concentrator (Amicon Ultra, 
Ozorowski et al.

 Millipore) to ~40 μL at 1 mg/mL. 5 μL of the complex was incubated with 3 μL of a fresh 
DDM solution at 1.8 mM. A 3 μL aliquot of the complex was applied to a C-Flat grid 
(CF-2/2-4C, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Protochips, Inc.) which had been plasma 
cleaned for 5 seconds using a mixture of Ar/O2 (Gatan Solarus 950 Plasma system), blotted 
off, and then immediately plunged into liquid ethane using a manual freeze plunger.
The same procedure was used to prepare the B41 complexes except that the incubation time 
of trimer and ligand(s) was increased to ~18 hrs prior to SEC. This long incubation time 
increased stoichiometry of binding for ligands with slow on-rates and did not have an effect 
on overall trimer stability judged by the lack of dimers or monomers in both SEC peaks and 
EM classifications.
CryoEM data collection
Frozen-hydrated samples were inserted into a Titan Krios electron microscope (FEI, 
Hillsboro, Oregon) operating at 300 kV. Data was collected through the Leginon software 
solution30–32. Each micrograph movie was collected at a magnification of 22,500, which 
resulted in a pixel size of 1.31 Å in the specimen plane. Micrograph movies were acquired 
using a K2 direct detector camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, California) operated in counting mode 
with 200 ms exposure per frame. Dose rate was ~10 e-/pix/sec and defocus range was −1.0 
to −4.0 μm. Micrograph movie frames were aligned and dose-weighted using MotionCor233. 
CTF models were calculated using GCTF34.
Data processing for B41LF, B41b12, B41PGV04, and B41CD4/17b
Molecular projection image candidates were then identified in the aligned micrograph 
movies using DoG Picker35. Reference-free, 2D classification was performed using 
identified projection image candidates binned by a factor of two via iterative multivariate 
statistical analysis and multi-reference alignment36,37. Particles corresponding to class 
averages of the molecular complexes were selected for further processing in Relion version 
2.038. Initially, full-size molecular projection images were refined against a simulated 
density map of an unliganded BG505 SOSIP Env trimer (simulated from the Env part of 
PDB ID 5CEZ) low-pass filtered at 60 Å. Initial refinement was followed by 3D 
classification and stable symmetrical classes were selected for further symmetrized (C3) 
refinement. Resolutions were calculated using soft-edged masks that encompassed the entire 
structure (including all noisier regions) and are reported according to the FSC 0.143 gold-
standard criterion. Final resolutions are ~3.6 Å (B41b12), ~3.7 Å (B41CD4/17b), ~5.2 Å 
(B41CD4), ~5.6 Å (B41LF) and ~7.4 Å (B41PGV04).
Data processing of BG505sCD4 and BG505sCD4/17b
Single particles were selected using DoGPicker35 from the whole-frame aligned and 
summed micrographs and used to create an initial raw particle stack after removing regions 
of the micrographs containing gold or large areas of aggregation. The raw particle stack was 
extracted using a box size of 256 pixels, and was immediately binned by 2 in reciprocal 
space, to a pixel size of 2.62 Å/pix and a box size 128 pixels. Initial 2D classification in 
Relion indicated a mixture of particle populations from sub-stoichiometric binding of sCD4 
and 17b. Particles contributing to classes that did not produce clear structural features were

 discarded, leaving 98,845 particles. Next, to separate the different particle populations, this 
stack was subjected to competitive sorting using 3 initial models – trimer alone, trimer + 
sCD4, trimer + sCD4 + 17b Fab – in an identical manner as previously described39. This 
resulted in three separate stacks containing 69,105 particles (trimer alone), 6,342 particles 
(trimer + sCD4), and 23,398 particles (trimer + sCD4 + 17b). Each of these individual stacks 
was then subjected to 4-model classification in Relion, using 60 Å as the initial low-pass 
filter value38, followed by parameter conversion and final classification in Frealign40. For 
each subgroup, the number of classes in Frealign was varied from 2 to 4, and a final value 
was selected such that the classification would produce at least 2 nearly identical models, as 
described earlier41,42. Within the stack comprising the trimer alone or the trimer + sCD4, 
this procedure resulted in removal of bad particles that did not produce interpretable maps 
(Figure S5C); within the stack comprising the trimer + sCD4 + 17b, this resulted in 1 low 
resolution class that was discarded, as well as 3 classes that differed in the relative 
configuration of the 17b Fab, but that were otherwise very similar. Final resolutions (FSC 
0.143) are ~10.5 Å (BG505CD4), and ~8.6 Å (BG505CD4/17b).
Model building and refinement
Model building and refinement steps followed those previously described43. Briefly, initial 
homology models of B41 gp120 and gp41 were generated using Modeller44 and the crystal 
structure of ligand-free BG505 SOSIP.664 (PDB: 4ZMJ) as a template for B41LF and 
B41b12, while the crystal structure of gp120 bound to sCD4 and 17b (PDB: 1GC1) was used 
to model gp120 of B41CD4/17b. Coordinates for sCD4, 17b, b12, and PGV04 were obtained 
from PDB IDs 1GC1, 1RZ8, 2NY7, and 3J5M, respectively. Individual chains were fit into 
the respective cryoEM maps using UCSF Chimera45 and refined using a combination of 
Rosetta density-guided iterative local refinement46, RosettaRelax47, and manual building in 
COOT48. Glycans were built using an idealized Man9 model that was placed into 
corresponding glycan density in UCSF Chimera. Torsion angles were adjusted in UCSF 
Chimera until good agreement was achieved between map and model. Sugar molecules with 
disordered or no density were removed. The final models were further refined using 
Phenix49 real space refinement without NCS constraints. Glycans were validated by pdb-
care50 and CARP51 and structures were evaluated using EMRinger52 and Molprobity53. 
Figures were generated in UCSF Chimera or Pymol54. Buried surface area calculations were 
performed using PDBePISA55 and R.M.S.D. analysis was performed in UCSF Chimera. 
Map fitting cross correlations were calculated using the Fit In Map feature in UCSF 
Chimera.
Negative stain EM
A stock of B41 SOSIP.664 was thawed on ice and 3 μL were adsorbed onto a Cu400 carbon-
coated grid for 10 s before blotting, and then stained for 60 s with 2% (w/v) uranyl formate. 
The remaining stock was then incubated at 37°C for 1 hr on a heat block. 3 μL were 
removed and immediately adsorbed onto a carbon-coated grid followed by staining. The 
stock was again incubated on ice for 1 hr before a third grid was prepared using the same 
method. Data were collected and processed as described in Pugach et al., and de Taeye et al.

CD4 and 17b from the cryoEM and x-ray crystallography models (PDB 1gc1). The Cα 
R.M.S.D. between our model and the x-ray structure of gp120 core in complex with sCD4

bound state
(a) Alignment of gp120 from the cryoEM models of B41LF and B41CD4/17b illustrates a 
significant displacement of the V1, V2, and V3 loops. (b) Fitting of the B41b12 model into 
the map of B41CD41/17b reveals a steric barrier created by b12 that prevents the translocation 
of V1/V2, which would clash with the antibody heavy chain. (c) Glycan N262 is 
repositioned away from the C1 domain of gp120 upon sCD4 binding as a result of V3 
translocation (left). The relative positions of N262 in B41LF and B41CD4/17b are supported

variable loops between pre-fusion and CD4-bound states of B41 SOSIP (left). Loss of 
density for the V3 loop in both B41CD4 and B41CD4/17b maps suggests that V3 movement is 
in response to priming by CD4 and not caused by 17b or the co-receptor (right).

 (a) Segmented cryoEM map with components colored according to the key. (b) Docking of 
BG505 + PGV04 (PDB 3J5M) and B41LF models into the B41 + PGV04 reconstruction. 
Comparison with BG505 bound to PGV04 demonstrates a high degree of structural 
similarity (91% correlation between the two cryoEM maps), and docking of the B41LF 
model into the B41PGV04 map results in excellent agreement, with the B41LF backbone 
atoms falling into density as well as alignment of PNGS asparagine residues with glycan 
density (94% correlation between B41LF and B41PGV04 maps). (c) FSC of B41PGV04. (d)

Comparison of VRC01 and b12 epitopes with respect to the open, b12-bound conformation 
of B41 SOSIP.664. (f) Docking of either the crystal structure of gp120-b12 or the B41b12 
cryoEM model into the ECT reconstruction of HIV-1 BaL in complex with b12 
(EMDB-5018) reveals differences in relative movement and rotation of gp120 from the 
trimer axis and ultimate position of b12.

 respect to the cryoEM model (right). These differences may arise due to a more stable, 
neutralization resistant Tier-2 virus (B41) versus a more flexible lab-adapted Tier 1 BaL 
pseudovirus, the stabilizing SOSIP modifications used in the soluble constructs (although 
none are located at the CD4bs epitope or gp120 core), or the low resolution of the cryoET 
map. (c) The pre-fusion arrangement of gp120 does not allow for b12 binding to B41 SOSIP.
664 due to clashes between the framework regions of the antibody and portions of a 
neighboring gp120 monomer (V3 and glycans). (d) Rotation of the N197 glycan requires the 
gp120 subunits to open up and move away from one another. (e,f) Glycan N197 in the b12 
epitope acts as a steric barrier in the pre-fusion state and rearranges and moves away from 
the b12 epitope to allow for b12 binding.

 Extended Data Figure 8. Overview of HIV-1 Env conformational states
Various biophysical data strongly suggest that the pre-fusion trimer is in an equilibrium of 
reversible open and closed states. b12 recognizes a more open state and traps the trimer in an 
irreversible intermediate state that can no longer play a role in host cell fusion. CD4, on the 
other hand, induces a stable, fusion intermediate that displays the co-receptor binding site 
and primes the fusion peptide to move to a more centralized location in the trimer interface. 
It is only after binding of CXCR4/CCR5 to CD4-bound Env that additional fusion steps 
occur, highlighted by the full formation of a three-helix bundle before final condensation

 into a six-helix bundle. When a dimer of CCR5 from a crystal structure is docked on top of 
the trimer structure, the N-termini of the two co-receptors are situated proximal to the co-
receptor binding sites on gp120.

 Figure 2. CD4/17b-bound B41 SOSIP.664 structural rearrangements that result in a stable fusion 
intermediate
(a) A network of hydrophobic and aromatic residues transmits the signal upon sCD4 binding 
that leads to the structural rearrangements in both gp120 and gp41. (b) The top of the HR1 
helix is capped by the α1 helix of the same protomer in the pre-fusion state (left). CD4-
binding results in the formation of helix α0, which now caps HR1 of a neighboring protomer 
(middle). A zoom in of the α0-HR1 interaction reveals that it is downstream to the 
engineered I559P mutation and likely a feature in native Env (right). (c) The D1 arm of

 glycan N262 rotates into a newly formed pocket on gp120 (left) positioned under the co-
receptor binding site at the base of V3, providing a link between the co-receptor binding site 
and gp41. The α0 helix region is generally disordered in all published crystal structures of 
SOSIP trimers as evidenced by higher B-factors for this segment relative to the average 
gp120 value for each structure (right).

 Figure 3. Additional stabilization resulting from CD4-bound rearrangements
(a) Space filling model of B41CD4/17b illustrating a newly created pocket that is now 
occupied by the fusion peptide. A close- up view of the pocket (center) and space-filling 
model (right). (b) K574 of gp41, which forms a salt bridge with D107 of gp120 in the pre-
fusion state, now interacts with F53 of gp120. (c) The tryptophan clasp, previously described 
as a stabilizing feature of the pre-fusion state14, is retained in the CD4-bound state. (d) Intra-
protomer stabilizing interactions of helix α0 and β3-β4. (e) Two aromatic residues of the 
fusion peptide rearrange upon CD4-binding and fit in two pockets. Sequence alignment of 
the fusion peptides of BG505 (pre-fusion) and B41 (CD4-bound) with the aromatic residues 
highlighted. All pre-fusion model coordinates are based on PDB: 5CEZ.

(a) CryoEM map segmented by component. (b) Comparison of gp120 variable loops before 
and after b12 binding; B41LF (left) and B41b12 (middle). Superposition of gp120 from pre-
fusion and b12-bound states reveals only slight structural differences in the individual gp120 
subunits (right). (c) Structural rearrangements in gp41 between the pre-fusion and b12-
bound states include repacking of the HR1 three-helix bundle as well as ordering of the 
fusion peptide and fusion peptide proximal region (FPPR). Alignment onto HR2 of single
