Abstract
Astrocytes are key homeostatic cells of the central nervous system. They cooperate with neurons at
several levels, including ion and water homeostasis, chemical signal transmission, blood flow regulation,
immune and oxidative stress defense, supply of metabolites and neurogenesis. Astroglia is also impor-
tant for viability and maturation of stem-cell derived neurons. Neurons critically depend on intrinsic
protective and supportive properties of astrocytes. Conversely, all forms of pathogenic stimuli which
disturb astrocytic functions compromise neuronal functionality and viability. Support of neuroprotec-
tive functions of astrocytes is thus an important strategy for enhancing neuronal survival and
improving outcomes in disease states. In this review, we first briefly examine how astrocytic dysfunc-
tion contributes to major neurological disorders, which are traditionally associated with malfunctioning
of processes residing in neurons. Possible molecular entities within astrocytes that could underpin the
cause, initiation and/or progression of various disorders are outlined. In the second section, we explore
opportunities enhancing neuroprotective function of astroglia. We consider targeting astrocyte-
specific molecular pathways which are involved in neuroprotection or could be expected to have a
therapeutic value. Examples of those are oxidative stress defense mechanisms, glutamate uptake, puri-
nergic signaling, water and ion homeostasis, connexin gap junctions, neurotrophic factors and the
Nrf2-ARE pathway. We propose that enhancing the neuroprotective capacity of astrocytes is a viable
strategy for improving brain resilience and developing new therapeutic approaches.

| INTRODUCTION
The central nervous system (CNS) represents a very challenging target
for therapeutic interventions. Even though numerus centrally acting
drugs are currently in use, these are largely molecules discovered deca-
des ago, sometimes with only minor modifications. It is generally
accepted that, for many diseases, effective therapies are lacking and
that many of the currently used drugs are only used due to the lack of
better ones, in spite of their adverse effects. For decades, the logic for
pursuing a potential drug target in the brain was its association with
processes localized to neurons, sometimes more and sometimes less
specifically aimed at a particular neuronal population. To some extent
that reflected the general “neurocentrism” in neuroscience, whereby
other components of the brain such as glial and vascular cells were
seen as irrelevant. More recently, we have learned of a wide range of
mechanisms which astrocytes employ to sustain neuronal networks
and sometimes directly affect their operation. One could argue that
even though targeting processes which are primarily compartmental-
ized to astrocytes may not lead to a quick modification of the activity
of such networks, in the long term, this approach can be better suited
for the chronic human diseases. In this review, we first briefly present
evidence that dysregulation of astrocytic functions is a common fea-
ture of many CNS diseases and then highlight some of the potentially
targetable processes in astrocytes which might be of value for future
drug development. For recent reviews on the potential drug targets in
microglia see (Moller and Boddeke, 2016; Noda, 2014).

| ASTROCYTES IN THE DISEASED BRAIN
ARE CENTRAL TO NEUROPATHOLOGY
Considering the pivotal role of astrocytes in brain homeostasis and the
strong metabolic cooperation between neurons and astrocytes, one
can postulate that astrocytic dysfunction may lead to neurological dis-
ease. These diseases share common pathogenic processes, such as oxi-
dative stress, excitotoxicity, metabolic failure or inflammation, many of
which are counteracted by astrocytes in the healthy brain. Thus, dis-
ease progression is associated with escalating harmful stimuli that
eventually exhaust the neuroprotective mechanisms of astrocytes.
Even worse, sometimes deleterious pathways may be switched on in
astrocytes, directly contributing to the pathology. Some excellent
reviews were published on this topic in recent years (Parpura et al.,
2012; Pekny et al., 2016; Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010; Verkhratsky
and Parpura, 2016).
2.1 | Alexander disease—a case of “primary”
astrocytic disease
A classic example of a “primary” astrocytic disease is Alexander disease
(AxD), a human neurological disorder unequivocally caused by a dys-
function of astrocytes due to mutations in the gene encoding glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Brenner, Goldman, Quinlan, & Messing,
2009; Messing, Brenner, Feany, Nedergaard, & Goldman, 2012). A
characteristic feature of this fatal disorder is the widespread presence
of intracellular protein aggregates in astrocytes, called Rosenthal fibers
(RF)—bundles of intermediate filaments surrounding irregular deposits
of dense material (Herndon, Rubinstein, Freeman, & Mathieson, 1970).
RF are composed of mutant GFAP in association with other constitu-
ents, especially the small stress proteins B-crystallin and heat shock
protein 27 (Iwaki, Kume-Iwaki, Liem, & Goldman, 1989). AxD is consid-
ered a gain-of-function disorder in the sense that the GFAP mutations
produce consequences that differ dramatically from those caused by
the absence of GFAP (Brenner et al., 2009; Messing et al., 2012). This
makes gene therapy based on expression of wild type GFAP in AxD
patients impossible since it may instead exacerbate disease by increas-
ing the GFAP load. One of the most notable functional changes in
Alexander astrocytes is the decreased glutamate transport across the
cell membrane. More than 75% reduction of glutamate transporter 1
(GLT1, also known as excitatory amino acid transporter 2, EAAT2, or
solute carrier family 1 member 2, SLC1A2) immunoreactivity was
observed in mouse models of AxD and astrocytes in hippocampal CA1
region of human patients show variable to complete loss of immuno-
staining for EAAT2 (Tian et al., 2010b). EAAT2 is preferentially localized
in astrocytes and is the major mediator of glutamate clearance in
humans. Reduced glutamate uptake puts neurons at risk of glutamate
overload and excitotoxicity, explaining why seizures are common in
Alexander disease (Messing et al., 2012).

 2.2 | Other pathologies involving astrocytes
Astrocytic dysfunction has been extensively implicated in the pathoge-
nesis of numerous diseases for which the primary cause has not yet
been identified. These include Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS), Epilepsy, Huntington’s disease (HD), Ischemia/
stroke and Parkinson’s disease (PD), some of which are listed in
(Table 1).
2.2.1 | AD
AD is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorder character-
ized by progressive memory loss and a range of cognitive deficits
(McKhann et al., 1984). Aggregation and deposition of b-amyloid (Ab)
and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles are classical hallmarks of
AD (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002). Ab deposition in the brain seems to pre-
cede neurofibrillary tangle formation, neuronal cell death and subse-
quent functional decline (Jack et al., 2010). Astrocytes play an
important neuroprotective role in AD by internalizing and degrading
Ab peptides, thus helping to avoid formation of the deposits of toxic
extracellular Aß (Koistinaho et al., 2004; Kurt, Davies, & Kidd, 1999).
The precise mechanism by which astrocytes recognize and degrade Ab
is not known, but apolipoprotein E (APOE), which is almost exclusively
expressed in astrocytes, has been proposed to be responsible for this
function (Koistinaho et al., 2004). The APOE gene found in humans on
chromosome 19 has three loci: APOE-e2, APOE-e3 and APOE-e4. In
1993 it was demonstrated that homozygocity for APOE-e4 greatly
increases the risk for late onset AD, being almost sufficient to cause it
in patients by the age of 80 (Corder et al., 1993). Shortly afterwards it
was reported that the other allele, APOE-e2, in contrast, is rather “pro-
tective” against AD (Corder et al., 1994). These two isoforms of APOE
have an opposite effect on the phagocytic activity of astrocytes
whereby APOE-e2 increases their ability to “digest” synapses while
APOE-e4 reduces it, making synapses more vulnerable to complement-
mediated degeneration (Klionsky et al., 2016). Literature on the role of
APOE in AD is extensive and its detailed revision is outside of the
scope of this review.
Current medicines are ineffective and only temporarily alleviate
symptoms, or slightly slow down AD progression in some people. Two
types of medication are currently approved by the FDA for use against
memory loss in AD, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine.
Memantine is classified as an NMDA receptor antagonist, originally
developed as anti-diabetic drug. It is interesting that NMDA receptors
on astrocytes and neurons have different subunit compositions and
memantine blocks astroglial NMDA receptors with five times lower
IC50 than those on neurons (Palygin, Lalo, & Pankratov, 2011). Even
though therapeutic activity of memantine in AD is subtle, it is still one
of the very few drugs clinically approved for moderate-to-severe AD.
Recent studies from M. Nedergaard’s laboratory opened a very
interesting line of thought in this field. It was shown that the extracel-
lular space which is to a large extent, regulated by the subtle changes
in the volume of astrocytes has a dramatic effect on the movement of
macro-molecules and their drainage through the so-called “glymphatic”
system (Iliff et al., 2012; Thrane, Rangroo Thrane, Plog, & Nedergaard,
2015). During wakefulness this extracellular trafficking pathway for
tracer molecules and Ab shrinks, but during sleep it opens up, facilitat-
ing brain clearance of potentially toxic products. Coordinated expan-
sion of the glymphatic clearance pathway seems to be controlled via
norepinephrine receptors on astrocytes (Xie et al., 2013). Therefore,
AD could be to some extent seen as a result of failure of the “brain
drain” pathway.
Reactive astrogliosis is another well-known feature of AD (Meda,
Baron, & Scarlato, 2001). Astrogliosis tends to be focal in AD such that
reactive astrocytes are associated with amyloid plaques and surround
them with layers of processes as if forming miniature scars in an
attempt to create neuroprotective barriers (Olabarria, Noristani, Verkh-
ratsky, & Rodriguez, 2010). The intensity of astrogliosis increases with
progression of AD, while the levels of astrocyte glutamate transporters
decline, exposing neurons to additional excitotoxic damage (Simpson
et al., 2010). The glutamate transporter EAAT2 is downregulated in AD
(Tian, Kong, Lai, Ray-Chaudhury, & Lin, 2010a). Calcium homeostasis is
also affected. Both resting calcium and intracellular calcium waves in
astrocytes near plaques are increased, indicating that the astrocyte net-
work contributes to AD pathology (Kuchibhotla, Lattarulo, Hyman, &
Bacskai, 2009). Additionally, gap junctions between astrocytes are
altered in AD (Nagy, Li, Hertzberg, & Marotta, 1996). Increased gluta-
mate and ATP release has been linked to altered gap junction expres-
sion, suggesting that blocking hemichannels in neurons could be
neuroprotective in AD (Orellana et al., 2011).
AD is also accompanied by signs of inflammation (Douen et al.,
2000). Increased cerebral levels of Ab peptides and their subsequent
deposition lead to the activation of the surrounding microglia and
astrocytes (Li et al., 2011). Upon activation, both microglia and astro-
cytes release pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, thereby establish-
ing a chronic parenchymal inflammation (Orre et al., 2014). Chronic
inflammatory stimulation of astrocytes reduces their capacity to release
neurotrophic factors, for example glia-derived neurotrophic factor, pos-
sibly contributing to cognitive decline in AD (Parpura et al., 2012). At
later stages, inflammation becomes directly damaging to the brain and
glial cytokines and chemokines lead to destruction of axons, dendrites
and synapses (Pekny et al., 2016).
Accumulation of Ab increases oxidative stress (Radi, Formichi, Bat-
tisti, & Federico, 2014), possibly due to a decrease in antioxidants and
antioxidant enzymes in astrocytes (Canevari, Abramov, & Duchen,
2004; Zhao and Zhao 2013), or mitochondrial dysfunction which occur
already at the early stages of AD (Gandhi and Abramov 2012; Kim,
Kim, Rhie, & Yoon, 2015).
To sum up, astrocytes may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD
at multiple levels. They might be driving neurodegeneration, but also
be elements of defense. Multiple neuroprotective pathways residing in
astrocytes have not been fully explored in AD.
2.2.2 | HD
HD is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progres-
sive motor, cognitive and psychiatric decline (Ghosh and Tabrizi, 2015).
HD is caused by an expanded chain (more than 36) of glutamines in
the N-terminal region of the huntingtin protein, causing intracellular

 accumulation and aggregation of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) (Mangiarini
et al., 1996). At the cellular level, neurodegeneration in HD is most evi-
dent in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) (Vonsattel et al., 1985).
However, the expression of mHTT in neurons alone cannot recapitu-
late the key features of HD (Gu et al., 2005). Indeed, mHTT is accumu-
lated in astrocytes, whose function is altered in HD (Shin et al., 2005).
Astrocytic glutamate uptake is defective in the R6/2 HD mouse model,
where levels of EAAT2 are reduced, leading to increase in striatal
extracellular glutamate and excitotoxicity (Maragakis and Rothstein,
2001). Recently, astrocytic Kir4.1 was reported to be significantly
downregulated in HD mouse models, independently of overt astroglio-
sis (Ben Haim et al., 2015). Decreased expression of Kir4.1 K1 channels
leads to elevated striatal extracellular K1 in vivo which can result in
depolarization of neurons. Genetic restoration of Kir4.1 levels in striatal
astrocytes returned extracellular K1 and MSN excitability to normal,
along with improvement of some motor functions in R6/2 mice (Tong
et al., 2014). Recent work confirmed that the loss of astrocytic Kir4.1-
and EAAT2-mediated homeostatic functions in R6/2 mice compro-
mises glutamate handling and Ca21 signaling, contributing to MSNs
pathology in the striatum (Jiang, Diaz-Castro, Looger, & Khakh, 2016).
It follows, that the loss of astrocytic control over glutamate and potas-
sium extracellular levels may contribute to pathology seen in HD and
the proteins affected by HD in astrocytes, such as EAAT2 and Kir4.1
channels, might represent therapeutic targets in HD. The difficulty,
however, is that in both cases we would need positive modulators
which is usually a more difficult task than development of blockers.
Other astrocytic functions which have been implicated in pathoge-
nesis of HD are release of GABA, trophic factors, and inflammatory sig-
naling (Filous and Silver, 2016). Astrocytes in HD models release less
GABA, resulting in impaired tonic extra-synaptic inhibition (Wojtowicz,
Dvorzhak, Semtner, & Grantyn, 2013). Both human and mouse data
consistently show increased activation of the NFkB signaling in astro-
cytes, leading to enhanced inflammation (Hsiao, Chen, Chen, Tu, &
Chern,
2013).

enhanced motor function and reduced aggregates of mutant huntingtin
in a mouse model of HD, suggesting that targeting of this pathway
may be a viable strategy to slow the progression of HD (Hsiao et al.,
2013). Additionally, accumulation of mHTT aggregates in astrocytes
reduces secretion of brain derived neurotrophic factor (Wang et al.,
2012). These events induce a reactive state in astrocytes, leading to
release of the precursor form of NGF which may promote apoptosis of
motor neurons (Domeniconi, Hempstead, & Chao, 2007).
Thus, poor astrocytic clearance of glutamate, improper control of
extracellular K1, and reduced release of neurotrophic factors are plau-
sible contributors to the pathogenesis of HD.
2.2.3 | ALS
ALS is an adult-onset disorder caused by selective degeneration of
cortical and spinal motor neurons, leading to progressive paralysis and
muscle atrophy (Gordon, 2013). Both familial and sporadic forms of
ALS exist, with �20% of familial forms associated with dominant muta-
tions in the gene encoding Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1). The
mutated human hSOD1 has been used for generating experimental
models of ALS (Turner and Talbot, 2008). Analysis of various types of
these models revealed the primary role of astroglia in pathology. Astro-
glial degeneration and atrophy associated with the loss of function pre-
cede neuronal death and occur before the emergence of clinical
symptoms (Valori, Brambilla, Martorana, & Rossi, 2014; Verkhratsky,
Parpura, Pekna, Pekny & Sofroniew, 2014). When SOD1 was specifi-
cally expressed in astrocytes, it made them highly vulnerable to extrac-
ellular glutamate and resulted in secretion of several neurotoxic
factors. Silencing of mutant hSOD1 in astrocytes markedly decelerated
the progression of experimental ALS (Yamanaka et al., 2008).
Another critical pathogenic factor in ALS is the deficient glutamate
clearance by astroglia. Selective loss or dysfunction of astrocytic gluta-
mate transporters in spinal cord and cerebral cortical areas might
account for the glutamate excitotoxicity to neurons. Genetic deletion
of astrocytic EAAT2 in mice caused death of motor neurons, thus repli-
cating some features of ALS (Staats and Van Den Bosch, 2009). In line
with this, immunohistochemistry revealed a selective loss of astroglial
EAAT2 in the motor cortex and ventral horn of the spinal cord of tis-
sues from patients with sporadic ALS (Rossi and Volterra, 2009). It has
been proposed that the reduced activity of glutamate transporters in
familial ALS could be a result of the malfunction of SOD1, leading to
long-lasting oxidation of transporter proteins’ sulfhydryl groups (Seifert,
Schilling, & Steinhauser, 2006; Trotti, Rolfs, Danbolt, Brown, & Hediger,
1999). At the later stages of ALS, reactive astrogliosis as well as the
activation of microglial cells become particularly prominent (Turner
et al., 2004; Valori et al., 2014).
To summarize, at the initial stages of ALS, compromised astroglial
glutamate clearance may be the cause of glutamate excitotoxicity.
Later, reactive responses of astrocytes and microglia progress in paral-
lel with the loss of motor neurons (Zhu et al., 2015).
2.2.4 | PD
PD, the second most common age-associated neurodegenerative disor-
der, affects �1% of the population over 60 years of age. Its main histo-
pathological features are the loss of dopaminergic neurons and the
presence of a-synuclein-containing aggregates (so-called Lewy bodies)
in the substantia nigra (SN) (Spillantini et al., 1997). In addition to the
commonly known motor symptoms, PD is accompanied by autonomic
dysfunction, cognitive, psychiatric,
sensory
symptoms
and
sleep
disturbances.
Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are probably the
key events which cause degeneration and death of dopaminergic neu-
rons in the SN (Adams, Chang, & Klaidman, 2001; Sayre, Smith, &
Perry, 2001). Oxidative stress in PD manifests as low levels of the anti-
oxidant glutathione (GSH) (Bharath, Hsu, Kaur, Rajagopalan, & Ander-
sen, 2002), increased lipid peroxidation (Dexter et al., 1989), nucleic
acid oxidation (Alam et al., 1997) and increased iron content in the
dopaminergic zones of the brain (Sofic, Paulus, Jellinger, Riederer, &
Youdim, 1991). Astrocytes are important for the antioxidant protection
via secretion of various antioxidant molecules (Sidoryk-Wegrzynowicz,
Wegrzynowicz, Lee, Bowman, & Aschner, 2011). However, in PD,
astrocytic protection of neurons is limited, possibly due to a decline in
GSH trafficking caused by chronic iNOS induction (Heales, Lam,
1208 |
LIU ET AL.
 Duncan, & Land, 2004). Depletion of GSH may facilitate production of
reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species, causing alterations in
neuronal proteins such as a-synuclein. Furthermore, the nitration of
a-synuclein by reactive nitrogen species significantly enhances the for-
mation of synuclein fibrils in vitro, resembling the situation in PD brains
(Chinta and Andersen, 2008; Paxinou et al., 2001).
Chronic neuroinflammation is another hallmark of PD pathophysi-
ology. Post-mortem analyses of human PD patients and experimental
animal studies demonstrate activation of glial cells and increases in
pro-inflammatory factors (Wang, Liu, & Zhou, 2015). Although micro-
glia is the major cell type involved in the inflammatory responses, astro-
cytes are also involved. A suggested scenario is that a-synuclein
aggregation activates microglia, which then leads to activation of astro-
cytes by pro-inflammatory cytokines (Saijo et al., 2009). Uncontrolled
neuroinflammation caused by the synergic activation of microglia and
astrocytes ultimately results in production of neurotoxic factors which
trigger death of dopaminergic neurons in the SN (Glass, Saijo, Winner,
Marchetto, & Gage, 2010).
2.2.5 | Epilepsy
Epilepsy affects more than 50 million people worldwide (Hesdorffer
et al., 2011). The main clinical manifestation are seizures, sudden, and
unpredictable episodes of abnormal electrical brain activity which can
lead to convulsions. Seizures are signs of excessive synchronisation of
neuronal activity and the search for anti-epileptic drugs have been
largely concentrated on compounds that affect neurons, for example
ion channel blockers or agonists of GABAA receptors. The efficacy of
these drugs, old and newly created, has not improved substantially
over the past decades and the drugs merely suppress symptoms with-
out treating the underlying processes. Resistance to treatment is also
common. There is, therefore, an urgent need for more efficacious med-
ications. Astrocytes might offer some interesting targets here. Speci-
mens from patients with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy and
animal epilepsy models revealed alterations in expression, localization
and function of astrocytic connexins, K1 and water channels. In addi-
tion, disturbed gliotransmission as well as malfunction of glutamate
transporters
and
of
the
astrocytic
glutamate-
and
adenosine-
converting enzymes—glutamine synthetase and adenosine kinase,
respectively—have been documented in epileptic tissues (Coulter and
Steinhauser, 2015).
Downregulation of inward-rectifying Kir4.1 channels in astrocytes
in hippocampus of epileptic patients points to impaired K1 clearance
from the extracellular space and increased seizure susceptibility
[reviewed by (Bedner and Steinhauser, 2013)]. Global knockout of
Kir4.1 leads to postnatal lethality (Neusch, Rozengurt, Jacobs, Lester, &
Kofuji, 2001), whereas conditional Kir4.1 knockout in astrocytes alone
is able to trigger epilepsy (Chever, Djukic, McCarthy, & Amzica, 2010;
Haj-Yasein et al., 2011a). In the same vein, mutations or single nucleo-
tide polymorphisms in the genes encoding Kir4.1 are associated with
human epilepsy (Bedner and Steinhauser. 2013). Much of Kir4.1 pro-
tein co-localizes with the water channel AQP4 in the astroglial endfeet
(Nielsen et al., 1997), suggesting that K1 clearance might depend on
concomitant transmembrane flux of water. In line with this idea, reduc-
tion in perivascular AQP4 was associated with compromised clearance
of extracellular K1 and impaired K1 buffering (Amiry-Moghaddam
et al., 2003). Prolonged seizures occur in AQP4 knockout mice (Binder
et al., 2006).
It is unsurprising that excess of extracellular glutamate characteris-
tic of human epileptic tissue can be linked to recurrent seizures and
neuronal death (Glass and Dragunow, 1995). In mice, knockout of
EAAT2 results in spontaneous seizures and hippocampal pathology.
Pharmacological inhibition of EAAT2 reduced the threshold for evoking
epileptiform activity (Campbell and Hablitz, 2004; Demarque et al.,
2004). Reduced expression of EAAT2 and glutamate-aspartate trans-
porters (GLAST, SLC1A3) also occurs in a tuberous sclerosis epilepsy
model (Wong et al., 2003). However, the studies investigating the func-
tional expression of astrocytic glutamate transporters in human epi-
lepsy are inconsistent. Some studies reported a downregulation of
EAAT1 and EAAT2 (Proper et al., 2002), but others reported no signifi-
cant changes (Eid et al., 2004). For effective removal of excess extracel-
lular glutamate, the transmitter must be sequestered and metabolized
once taken up by astrocytes. Glutamate can be de-hydrogenated into
a-ketoglutarate by glutamate dehydrogenase. Alternatively, glutamate
can be converted into glutamine by glutamine synthase and then
returned to neurons. Loss of this astrocyte-specific enzyme is found in
epilepsy (Seifert and Steinhauser, 2013). A likely consequence is that
the shortage of glutamine can affect the pool of GABA which is syn-
thesized from glutamate in the inhibitory neurons, thus weakening inhi-
bition and precipitating seizures (Alvestad et al., 2011).
A novel and a rather unexpected approach to treatment of epi-
lepsy have been recently proposed by (Sada, Lee, Katsu, Otsuki, &
Inoue, 2015). These authors took their inspiration from the fact that
some patients with drug-resistant epilepsy benefit from a ketogenic
diet which limits the intake of carbohydrates. Why this is beneficial is
not known but the authors argue that it could be due to the impact on
the “lactate shuttle” (Allaman, Belanger, & Magistretti, 2011; Mosienko,
Teschemacher, & Kasparov, 2015; Pellerin and Magistretti 2003),
whereby astrocytes supply lactate to the actively firing neurons to be
used as energy substrate. Reduced supply of carbohydrates theoreti-
cally could limit utilization of glucose and therefore production of pyru-
vate and lactate by astrocytes in the brain. Sada et al. found that neural
activity and seizures can be suppressed by lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) inhibition and suggested that LDH could be a target for treat-
ment of epilepsy (see below).
Finally, astrocytic domain organization is disrupted in epilepsy
which may, for example, affect K1 buffering or neurotransmitter clear-
ance (Oberheim et al., 2008). Interestingly, wide-spread reactive astro-
gliosis which develops in a mouse with a conditional deletion of b1-
integrin leads to spontaneous seizures, most likely due to the impaired
uptake of glutamate (Robel et al., 2015). For further information on the
role of astrocytes in epilepsy, see (Coulter and Steinhauser 2015; Robel
2016) .
2.2.6 | Ischemia/stroke
Stroke is one of the main causes of death worldwide and the leading
cause of long-term neurological disability. The only treatment with
LIU ET AL.
| 1209
 proven efficiency is thrombolysis by intravenous administration of
recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. The role of astrocytes in
stroke recently attracts more and more attention. Indeed, astrocytes
are involved in a number of processes which profoundly influence tis-
sue viability during and after ischemia. It is generally acknowledged
that astrocytes are substantially more ischemia-resistant than neurons
and survive in conditions of limited blood supply, characteristic for
penumbra surrounding the core of the ischemic infarction (Swanson,
Farrell, & Stein, 1997; Vangeison, Carr, Federoff, & Rempe, 2008).
These surviving astrocytes undergo activation and are involved in neu-
roprotection
and
post-ischemic
regeneration
(Takano,
Oberheim,
Cotrina, & Nedergaard, 2009; Zhao and Rempe 2010). Astroglia contri-
butions to brain resilience could include clearance of glutamate, control
over K1 concentration, supply of lactate to the stressed neurons,
secretion of neuroprotective factors, and scavenging reactive oxygen
species by releasing GSH and ascorbic acid (Liu and Chopp 2015; Zhao
and Rempe 2010). Recently, using optogenetic control of H1 pumps
expressed on astrocytes, it was demonstrated that alkalinisation of
astrocytes could reduce glutamate release and limit the ischemic brain
damage in a cerebellar ischemia model. Therefore, controlling glial pH
may be an effective therapeutic strategy (Beppu et al., 2014). In the
absence of astroglia, the vulnerability of neurons to ischemia is greatly
increased (Tanaka et al., 1999). Reactive astrocytes surrounding the
ischemic core are the main contributors to the glial scar, along with oli-
godendrocytes and microglia, establishing a barrier between the dam-
aged and surviving tissue. At the same time, astrocytes are involved in
the pathology of stroke by production of neurotoxic substances,
release of reactive oxygen species and by being a part of the brain
edema mechanism (Liu and Chopp, 2015; Zhao and Rempe, 2010).
After the stroke, scar formation and expression of proteoglycans might
impede neurite outgrowth and inhibit structural and functional recov-
ery (Cregg et al., 2014; Silver and Miller, 2004). Glial scars represent
powerful barriers for re-growth of axons, also in the case of mechanical
trauma where astrogliosis is seen as a contributor to post-traumatic
epilepsy (Robel, 2016; Verellen and Cavazos, 2010). The triggers of glial
transformation and activation in stroke or trauma remain elusive.
Thus, astrocytic processes may be either pathogenic in stroke/
reperfusion or act as brain defense mechanisms which potentially could
be harnessed for therapeutic benefits.

| POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC TARGETS IN
ASTROCYTES
Astrocytes possess a number of potentially targetable and therapeuti-
cally plausible biochemical or signaling pathways. In the following sec-
tion, we summarize some of such candidate pathways and molecules
and discuss their therapeutic potential. The key known neuroprotective
pathways in astrocytes mentioned in this review are illustrated in Fig-
ure 1.
3.1 | Glutamate transporters, glutamate transmission
and excitotoxicity
As mentioned earlier, high concentrations of glutamate are neurotoxic.
The most abundant glutamate transporter in the brain is EAAT2 (syno-
nyms: GLT1 and SLC1A2) which is mainly expressed by astrocytes,
making them a vital element of the defense against excitotoxicity (Fon-
tana, 2015; Kim et al., 2011). Not surprisingly, loss or attenuation of
glial glutamate transporters have been implicated in the pathogenesis
of many CNS disorders, such as ALS (Rothstein, 2009), PD (Plaitakis
and Shashidharan, 2000), stroke (Lai, Zhang, & Wang, 2014), epilepsy
(Tanaka et al., 1997; Wetherington, Serrano, & Dingledine, 2008), HD

LIU ET AL.
 (Arzberger, Krampfl, Leimgruber, & Weindl, 1997), AD (Jacob et al.,
2007; Masliah, Alford, DeTeresa, Mallory, & Hansen, 1996), and major
psychiatric disorders (Choudary et al., 2005; Lauriat and McInnes,
2007; Miguel-Hidalgo et al., 2010). To the contrary, many animal stud-
ies indicate that upregulation of EAAT2 provides significant beneficial
effects in models of disease (Harvey et al., 2011; Kong et al., 2012;
Miller et al., 2012a; Takahashi et al., 2015b). Thus, EAAT2 represents a
pharmacological target which may modify neuronal function or protect
neurons.
The expression or activity of EAAT2 is regulated both transcrip-
tionally and post-transcriptionally (Grewer, Gameiro, & Rauen, 2014;
Takahashi, Foster, & Lin, 2015a). Therefore, theoretically, upregulation
of EAAT2 could be achieved at transcriptional or translational level. By
screening of 1,040 FDA-approved drugs and nutritionals, Rothstein
et al. discovered some molecules which could increase transcription of
the EAAT2 gene (Rothstein et al., 2005). The antibiotic ceftriaxone is
one of the best-studied candidates amongst this group, it has the lon-
gest half-life of available ß-lactam antibiotics and is believed to pene-
trate blood brain barrier (Yogev, Shulman, Chadwick, Davis, &
Glogowski, 1986). Ceftriaxone reduces glutamate excitotoxicity in ani-
mal models of PD, HD, ischemia, and multiple sclerosis (Cudkowicz
et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2015; Kelsey and Neville, 2014; Miller et al.,
2008). Ceftriaxone also delays loss of neurons and prolongs survival in
mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and stroke (Guo et al.,
2003; Thone-Reineke et al., 2008). In a clinical trial where ceftriaxone
was tested for treatment of ALS patients, it was well tolerated in stages
I and II (Berry et al., 2013). Unfortunately, stage III was discontinued
because no increase of the length of survival or prevention of a func-
tional decline was achieved (Cudkowicz et al., 2014). However, it may
still be possible to develop derivatives of ceftriaxone with improved
properties. It is also possible that ALS was not the best disease target
for it.
Currently, riluzole is the only FDA-approved drug for the treat-
ment of ALS, although it prolongs the life of ALS patients by only 7
months (Miller, Mitchell, & Moore, 2012b). A major action of riluzole is
the inhibition of glutamate release from presynaptic neurons, but it
also enhances astrocytic glutamate uptake by upregulating EAAT2
gene expression (Liu et al., 2011).
Colton et al. developed a cell-based enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assay approach to search for translational enhancers and identi-
fied 61 compound which increased EAAT2 protein levels (Colton et al.,
2010). These compounds enhanced glutamate transport without
changing EAAT2 mRNA level (Colton et al., 2010). The same group
developed thiopyridazine and pyridazine derivatives that increase
EAAT2 expression (Xing et al., 2011). Analog LDN/OSU-0212320, a
pyridazine derivative, protected cultured neurons from glutamate-
mediated excitotoxic injury. It also delayed motor function decline and
extended lifespan in an animal model of ALS (Kong et al., 2014). Fur-
ther tests of this analog in a range of animal models will potentially
reveal other diseases where reduction of excessive extracellular gluta-
mate can provide therapeutic advantage. Wider testing of these com-
pounds in other models and species but mice should verify the
therapeutic potential of this strategy.
In addition to EAAT2 transcriptional and translational activators,
there are chemicals that directly modulate the function of EAAT2. Par-
awixin1, purified from the venom of the spider parawixia bistriata,
enhances directly and selectively EAAT2 function by facilitating confor-
mational transitions involved in substrate translocation (Fontana et al.,
2007). Site-directed mutagenesis identified a structural region within
EAAT2 which is important for the transporter-enhancing activity in
transmembrane domains 2, 5, and 8 (Mortensen, Liberato, Coutinho-
Netto, Dos Santos, & Fontana, 2015). This unique structural informa-
tion could be employed in hybrid structure-based virtual screening of a
large library to identify novel allosteric modulators of EAAT2. Another
EAAT2 activator is the pyrazoline compound MS-153 ([R]-5-methyl-1-
nicotinoyl-2-pyrazoline) (Shimada et al., 1999) although recently it has
been questioned whether its effects are actually attributable to action
on EAAT2 or are a consequence of other effects such as inhibition of
Ca21 channels.
3.2 | GSH
Decreased brain content of GSH is an indicator of oxidative stress
which, in turn, is recognized as a central contributing factor to neurode-
generative diseases (Kim et al., 2015). Although GSH can cross the
blood-brain barrier, blood is probably not the major source of cerebral
GSH (Anderson, Underwood, Bridges, & Meister, 1989). Instead, the
predominant source in the brain is astrocytes, and this allows neurons
to maintain a sufficient antioxidant defense. Hence upregulating astro-
cytic GSH production could be a potential neuroprotective strategy.
Zonisamide, a novel anti-PD agent used in Japan, increased GSH levels
in the striatal astrocytes and demonstrated neuroprotective effects
against dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD mice (Asanuma et al.,
2010). However, this drug upregulates expression of a whole range of
factors which are also potentially neuroprotective and neurotrophic.
3.3 | Metallothioneins
Metallothioneins (MT) are a family of low molecular weight and
cysteine-rich
proteins with antioxidant,
anti-apoptotic,
and
anti-
inflammatory properties (Bolognin, Cozzi, Zambenedetti, & Zatta,
2014). MT has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases including
PD, AD, and also brain trauma and ischemia (Hozumi, 2013). Neuropro-
tective properties of MT are well documented (Chung, Hidalgo, &
West, 2008; Vasak, 2005). Deficiency in MT generally worsens the
damage caused by neurotoxic factors or trauma (Giralt et al., 2002).
However, in glioblastoma multiforme patients, high levels of MT are a
negative prognostic factor, probably because MT make tumors more
resistant to therapy (Mehrian-Shai et al., 2015).
The MT family is comprised of four main members, MT1 to MT4.
MT1 and MT2 are primarily expressed in astrocytes and it is thought
that astrocyte-derived MT facilitate neuronal survival and axonal
regeneration (Aschner, 1997; Hidalgo, Aschner, Zatta, & Vasak, 2001).
Exogenous MT1 and MT2 improved neuronal survival and axonal out-
growth in cortical, hippocampal, and dopaminergic cultures (Chung,
Vickers, Chuah, & West, 2003), and astrocytic MT protected dopami-
nergic neurons in a PD model (Miyazaki et al., 2011). In contrast, MT1
LIU ET AL.
| 1211
 and MT2 double knockout mice demonstrated impaired axonal regen-
eration after sciatic nerve crush and MT2A treatment promoted neurite
elongation and post-injury reactive neurite growth (Chung et al., 2003).
The exact mechanism of MT-mediated neuroprotection is not
known but possibly it involves zinc-mediated transcriptional activation
of genes involved in growth, proliferation, and differentiation (Sharma
and Ebadi, 2014; Sharma, Rais, Sandhu, Nel, & Ebadi, 2013). MT also
regulates copper metabolism and potentially by this route MT1 overex-
pression can slow disease progression in SOD1 (G93A) mice (model of
ALS) (Tokuda, Okawa, Watanabe, & Ono, 2014). MT also reduce oxida-
tive damage (Bolognin et al., 2014; Uttara, Singh, Zamboni, & Mahajan,
2009).
Interestingly, ageing is often accompanied by various late-life neu-
rodegenerative diseases, while MT show strong anti-ageing effects
(Sharma and Ebadi, 2014). Dietary supplements combined with geneti-
cally increased MT1 have been demonstrated to increase lifespan in
mice (Yang et al., 2006). Interestingly, exercise induces MT, at least in
the spinal cord (Hashimoto, Hayashi, Inuzuka, & Hozumi, 2009). So far,
no pharmacological compounds have been reported to specifically
induce MT synthesis in astrocytes or non-selectively in the brain.
Nevertheless, given the example of EAAT2 inducers (see above), this
does not look like an implausible idea.
3.4 | Aquaporin 4
The AQP4 water channel is exclusively expressed by astrocytes and
constitutes an astrocyte-specific mechanism regulating fluid homeosta-
sis which is fundamental for brain function (Badaut, Lasbennes, Magis-
tretti, & Regli, 2002; Nielsen et al., 1997). The enrichment of AQP4 in
astroglial endfeet surrounding blood vessels suggests that it regulates
not only astrocyte volume, but also the water traffic between vascular
and interstitial compartments, as well as the size, shape and diffusion
characteristics of the extracellular space (Xiao and Hu, 2014). AQP4 is
co-localized with Kir4.1, indicating that coordinated action of both
channels is required to maintain K1 homeostasis (Masaki et al., 2010).
Neuronal activity leads to transient increases in the extracellular K1
concentration and clearance of the excess K1 from the extracellular
space is an important function of astrocytes.
AQP4 knockout mice (both non-selective and glia-targeted) have a
significantly reduced tendency to develop cerebral edema following
water intoxication and stroke, as well as better survival and neurologi-
cal outcomes (Haj-Yasein et al., 2011b; Manley et al., 2000). Given the
role of AQP4 in K1 and water homeostasis, it seems rational to
develop AQP4 modulators as drugs against diseases involving brain
edema (King, Yasui, & Agre, 2000). Unfortunately, limited progress has
been made in AQP4-targeted therapeutics (Verkman, Anderson, &
Papadopoulos, 2014). This is partly due to the lack of robust assays of
AQP4 activity. The small size of the functional AQP4 monomer and its
very small pore diameter, which prevents the access of conventional
small molecules, translates to poor “druggability” (Verkman et al.,
2014). As AQP4 are simple passive pores, they lack sophisticated gat-
ing and transport mechanisms suitable for targeting with small mole-
cules. Furthermore, mutations in the extracellular and cytoplasmic
domains of AQP4 generally have little effect on water permeability
through the channel, which suggests that the binding of an inhibitor
has to occur deep in the narrow pore to physically prevent water con-
duction (Papadopoulos and Verkman, 2013; Verkman et al., 2014).
Nevertheless, further large-scale screening of random and computa-
tionally biased libraries in search of AQP4 blockers is warranted.
Rigorous tests for validation of putative lead compounds also need to
be developed.
3.5 | Connexin gap junctions
In contrast to most mature neurons, astrocytes are usually coupled
through gap junctions (GJ) to form large intercellular networks (Rouach,
Glowinski, & Giaume, 2000). GJ channels are built of connexin (CX)
proteins, of which CX43 and CX30 are the major subtypes in astro-
cytes (Giaume and McCarthy, 1996). Individual CX assemble into hex-
amers to form transmembrane channels, termed connexons, which
couple with apposing connexons on neighboring cells. Dense GJ pla-
ques may contain thousands of channels (Unwin and Zampighi, 1980).
GJ couple the cytoplasm of connected cells and permit movement of
ions and low molecular weight molecules (about 1–2 kDa (Loewen-
stein, 1981).We still do not know to what extent selectivity of the GJ
can change under different circumstances.
GJ between astrocytes allow movement of metabolic substrates
and support astrocytic spatial K1 buffering to modulate and potentially
synchronize neuronal activity (Gardner-Medwin, 1983). GJ are also
dense at the endfeet of astrocytes where they provide a perivascular
route that facilitates intercellular trafficking between neighboring end-
feet (Simard, Arcuino, Takano, Liu, & Nedergaard, 2003). Connexons
exist also on their own as single membrane hemichannels which con-
nect the cell cytoplasm to the extracellular milieu (Giaume, Leybaert,
Naus, & Saez, 2013). It is now known that under certain conditions CX
hemichannels can release ATP (Huckstepp et al., 2010) or lactate (Kara-
giannis et al., 2016).
Intercellular communication among astrocytes is lost in CX43/
CX30 double knockout mice, demonstrating their pivotal role in astro-
glial connectivity (Dermietzel et al., 2000; Giaume and Theis 2010).
CX43/CX30 double knockout leads to impaired potassium clearance
and disrupts synaptic transmission and plasticity (Pannasch et al., 2011;
Wallraff et al., 2006). CX43/CX30 double knockout also causes astro-
cyte endfeet edema and weakens the blood-brain barrier (Ezan et al.,
2012). Under pathological conditions, altered CX expression may lead
to a failure of glial communication (Rouach et al., 2002). Changes in
CX43 expression have been detected in animal models and human
patients with epilepsy, in ischemia and stroke, autism and neurodege-
nerative diseases (Takeuchi and Suzumura 2014).
Specific small molecule modulators of CX43/CX30 are not avail-
able and, at present, the best-characterized tools to target specific CX
are peptides that mimic a short stretch of amino acids on the extracel-
lular loop motifs of the target connexons. These interfere with GJ for-
mation and inhibit hemichannel activity (Evans and Boitano, 2001;
Leybaert et al., 2003). Because their initial characterization (Dahl, Non-
ner, & Werner, 1994), a series of ‘‘Gap’’ peptides with specificity for
certain CX were developed (Abudara et al., 2014; Chaytor, Evans, &
1212 |
LIU ET AL.
 Griffith, 1997; Evans and Boitano 2001; Gomes, Srinivas, Van Dries-
sche, Vereecke, & Himpens, 2005; Leybaert et al., 2003). A promising
new report shows that Gap19, a nonapeptide derived from the cyto-
plasmic loop of CX43, inhibits astroglial CX43 hemichannels, while not
affecting GJ channels (Abudara et al., 2014). Moreover, Gap19 is spe-
cific to CX43 and was demonstrated to cross the blood–brain barrier
when coupled to the HIV-derived TAT internalization sequence (Abu-
dara et al., 2014). The effect of this peptide in neuroprotection is cur-
rently being explored (Freitas-Andrade and Naus, 2016).
Because of their importance for astrocytic functions, CX30 and
CX43 represent potential drug targets of interest, although further
studies are needed in order to understand the precise molecular mecha-
nism regulating their gating properties. However, development of small
molecules for such targets clearly requires thinking out of the box.
3.6 | PAR-1 receptors
Protease-activated receptors (PAR) are G-protein-coupled receptors
(GPCR) activated by extracellular serine proteases. The thrombin recep-
tors PAR-1, 23 and 24 and the tryptase/trypsin receptor PAR-2 are
abundant in CNS (Ramachandran, Noorbakhsh, Defea, & Hollenberg,
2012). PAR are characterized by the presence of a tethered peptide
ligand in their N-terminal part which, when released by cleavage, acts
on the ligand binding site and activates the receptor. The expression of
PAR in the brain is differentially regulated in neurodegenerative disor-
ders like PD, AD, multiple sclerosis and stroke (Luo, Wang, & Reiser,
2007). Activation of PAR can lead to cell death or cell survival, depend-
ing on the magnitude and the duration of agonist stimulation.
PAR-1 is the best characterized receptor of this family which is
activated by the cleavage of the extracellular N-terminal domain by
thrombin. This releases a tethered ligand (SFLLRN) that activates the
receptor and initiates signaling through Gq/11, Gi/o, or G12/13 G-proteins
(Coughlin 2000; Traynelis and Trejo, 2007). In the CNS, PAR-1 is
expressed mainly (and in some areas almost exclusively) by astrocytes
although in the hippocampus PAR-1 is also present in some neurons
(Junge et al., 2004; Niclou, Suidan, Brown-Luedi, & Monard, 1994;
Wang, Ubl, & Reiser, 2002). Activation of PAR-1 leads to increases in
astrocytic [Ca21]i and astrocytes activated by PAR-1 agonists can
release glutamate which, in turn, may activate NMDA receptors on
adjacent neurons (Lee et al., 2007; Vance, Rogers, & Hermann, 2015).
Activation of PAR-1 might produce bimodal effects. Low-level
PAR-1 activation seems to be protective whereas high levels of PAR-1
activation compromise cell viability (Acharjee et al., 2011; Donovan,
Pike, Cotman, & Cunningham, 1997; Vaughan, Pike, Cotman, & Cun-
ningham, 1995). The neuroprotective effects of thrombin via PAR-1
activation have been confirmed in several independent studies both in
vitro and in vivo. PAR-1 activation protected neurons and astrocytes
against chemical insults, via regulation of the secretion of cytokine-
induced neutrophil chemoattractants (Wang, Luo, & Reiser, 2007).
PAR-1 activation by thrombin, further, diminished ceramide-induced
astrocyte death via upregulation of JUN N-terminal kinase (Wang, Luo,
Stricker, & Reiser, 2006), and rescued astrocytes through the PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway from chemically induced apoptosis (Zhu and Reiser,
2014).
In
vivo
PAR-1
activation
was
neuroprotective
in
a
6-
hydroxydopamine model of PD (Cannon et al., 2006).
In contrast, a number of studies suggest a pathophysiological role
for PAR-1 in various types of brain damage (Gutierrez-Rodriguez and
Herranz, 2015). In a murine model of stroke, neurotrauma and brain
hemorrhage, PAR-1-mediated signaling had deleterious effects on neu-
ronal survival and function. PAR-1 deficiency or its pharmacological
inhibition with an antagonist BMS-200261 reduced infarct volume in
the transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery model (Junge
et al., 2003). PAR-1 deficiency or the central application of PAR-1
antagonists also reduced neuronal injury following intrastriatal injection
of NMDA in rats (Hamill, Mannaioni, Lyuboslavsky, Sastre, & Traynelis,
2009). PAR-1 inhibitors reduced brain damage caused by the neuro-
toxic effects of blood in intracerebral hemorrhage (Xue, Hollenberg,
Demchuk, & Yong, 2009). PAR-1 could also be involved in the patho-
genesis of chronic neurodegenerative and/or inflammatory conditions.
Post-mortem tissue samples from patients affected by HIV-associated
dementia, a neurodegenerative condition affecting patients with AIDS,
show that PAR-1 expression is enhanced in astrocytes, which in turn
could induce expression of inflammatory mediators by these cells
(Acharjee et al., 2011; Boven et al., 2003). PAR-1 deficiency, as well as
the intraventricular administration of PAR-1 antagonists, also reduced
dopaminergic neuron damage and microgliosis in a MPTP model of PD
(Hamill et al., 2007). Possibly, reports of a potential pathogenic role of
PAR-1 signaling can be linked to facilitation of glutamate release activa-
tion of NMDA receptors as mentioned above.
Importantly, there are already small molecule PAR-1 antagonists
such as vorapaxar, also known as Zontivity, marketed as anti-platelet
drug (Bhandari and Mehta, 2014) and other prototype molecules such
as RWJ-56110 (Andrade-Gordon et al., 1999).
To summarize, PAR-1 modulation may be seen as a fairly
astrocyte-specific intervention within the brain. However, a major con-
cern with the systemic use of PAR-1 antagonists is their anti-
thrombotic effect. Therefore, a centrally acting drug which modulates
astrocytic PAR-1 would need to be devoid of hematinic side effects,
which may be achievable using a pro-drug strategy.
3.7 | Astrocytic GPR37 and GPR37L1
GPR37 and GRP37L1 are two closely related GPCRs which are almost
exclusively expressed in CNS in mammals. GPR37 is alternatively
known as the Parkin-Associated Endothelin-Like receptor (Pael-R) (Imai
et al., 2001), while GP37L1 is named for its similarity to GPR37. The
interest to GPR37 was boosted by its potential link to PD. Parkin is an
E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase and mutations in this gene are directly
linked to autosomal recessive juvenile PD (AR-JP). Although parkin has
many substrates, GPR37 attracted interest because GPR37 is up-
regulated in brains of AR-JP patients (Takahahshi, 2006). In addition,
GPR37 is present in the core of Lewy bodies, thus suggesting a role of
GPR37 aggregates in PD. Also, viral vector-mediated GPR37 overex-
pression in substantia nigra results in progressive degeneration of nigral
dopaminergic neurons (Dusonchet, Bensadoun, Schneider, & Aebischer,
2009; Low and Aebischer, 2012).
LIU ET AL.
| 1213
 Under normal conditions, correctly folded GPR37 is trafficked to
the cell surface but it has a high propensity to misfold. Parkin ubiquiti-
nates misfolded GPR37 targeting it for proteasomal degradation. If this
process fails, misfolded GPR37 forms aggregates. Mutations in the par-
kin gene enhanced dopaminergic neuronal cytotoxicity by failing to
remove aggregated GPR37 and other substrates. This leads to activa-
tion of the unfolded protein response and cell death, a process that
can be rescued by re-expression or overexpression of wild type parkin
(Imai et al., 2001). GPR37L1 does not undergo ubiquitination and thus
the phenomenon is limited to GPR37.
Up until relatively recently, the physiological functions of GPR37
and GPR37L1 were assessed mainly through use of knockout mice.
The connection between GPR37 and parkin has led to a focus on the
dopaminergic system in GPR37 knockout mice which exhibit progres-
sive loss of dopaminergic neurons, various subtle alterations to dopami-
nergic signaling and significantly reduced locomotor activity (Marazziti
et al., 2004, 2007, 2011). In humans, dysregulation of GPR37 has
recently been linked to major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and
autism spectrum disorder (Cruceanu et al., 2015; Fujita-Jimbo et al.,
2012; Tomita et al., 2013). In contrast to GPR37, the phenotype of
GPR37L1 knockout mice is less well characterized. The most remark-
able observation in these animals is that they are hypertensive (Min
et al., 2010) and have cardiac hypertrophy probably due to hyperten-
sion (Min et al., 2010). The link between GPR37L1 and blood pressure
control remains elusive. Another study reported abnormal cerebellum
development in GPR37L1 knockout mice that was a direct conse-
quence of premature downregulation of granule neuron precursor cell
proliferation and concomitant premature development and maturation
of Bergmann glia and Purkinje neurons (Marazziti et al., 2013).
Deorphanisation of GPR37 and GPR37L1 had been a difficult pro-
cess. Although they were originally identified through searches for
homologs of endothelin and bombesin receptors, neither GPR37 nor
GPR37L1 bind endothelins or related peptides (Leng, Gu, Simerly, &
Spindel, 1999; Zeng, Su, Kyaw, & Li, 1997). Eventually, an extracellular
peptide, prosaposin, and its active peptide fragments, prosaptides
(including the synthetic analog TX14A), were identified as agonists of
GPR37 and GPR37L1 (Meyer, Giddens, Schaefer, & Hall, 2013). Both
prosaposin and prosaptides have long been known as powerful and
essential neuroprotective and glioprotective factors (O’Brien et al.,
1995; Obrien, Carson, Seo, Hiraiwa, & Kishimoto, 1994). Mutations in
prosaposin in mammals result in severe neurodegeneration (Sikora,
Harzer, & Elleder, 2007; Yoneshige, Suzuki, Suzuki, & Matsuda, 2010).
Prosaposin and prosaptides were shown to couple via Gai and Gao
proteins which are pertussis toxin-sensitive (Hiraiwa, Campana, Martin,
& O’Brien, 1997; Yan, Otero, Hiraiwa, & O’Brien, 2000). The peptides
interacted with, at the time, unknown receptors with nanomolar affin-
ity and stimulated ERK phosphorylation (Subramaniam and Unsicker,
2010). Indeed, recently Meyer and colleagues found that GPR37 and
GPR37L1 met all these previously established characteristics (Meyer
et al., 2013).
Within the brain, GPR37 mRNA was detected both in neurons and
glia (Zeng et al., 1997) but it seems that only some neuronal types such
as dopaminergic (and probably other catecholaminergic neurons)
express it at high level. In contrast to the mixed distribution of GPR37,
GPR37L1 is highly expressed in astrocytes, with in situ hybridization
revealing greatest density of GPR37L1 within the Bergmann glia of the
cerebellum (Valdenaire et al., 1998). Microarray studies reported more
than 100 times higher expression of GPR37L1 in rat and mice astro-
cytes compared with neurons (Cahoy et al., 2008; Lovatt et al., 2007;
Zhang et al., 2014). GPR37L1 is also expressed in oligodendrocytes
(Zhang et al., 2014). These results are consistent with our own, yet
unpublished, transcriptomic analysis of rat brainstem astrocytes.
Given that the ligands of these receptors have well established
neuroprotective activities and that GPR37 and GPR37L1 are highly
expressed in astrocytes, one may speculate that the beneficial effects
of prosaposin and its derivatives might be mediated at least partially by
astrocytes rather than by a direct action on the neurons. Prosaptide
acting on GPR37/GPR37L1 clearly protected cultured astrocytes from
oxidative stress (Meyer et al., 2013). One important direction of current
research is to assess how these two receptors regulate astrocytic func-
tion and, via this route, modulate activity and survival of neurons. An
important question is also whether these effects are specific to only
some subtypes of neurons, for example catecholaminergic neurons.
Currently, no small molecule ligands for either GPR37 or GPR37L1 are
available, and thus the pharmacology of these receptors is unexplored
terrain that has the potential to yield clinically useful therapeutic drugs.
If any of the in vivo protective effects of prosaposin are indeed depend-
ent on astrocytic GPR37and/or GPR37L1, then a screen for small mol-
ecule agonists and/or positive allosteric modulators for these receptors
would be warranted. Such compounds may have outstanding therapeu-
tic value due to their potential to mimic and/or enhance the glio- and
neuroprotective actions of secreted prosaposin.
3.8 | Targeting astrocytic adenosine receptor A2a to
improve memory in AD
Adenosine is a potent neuromodulator derived from breakdown of
ATP and other adenine nucleotides. Adenosine and ATP are released in
the brain by diverse cell types (Burnstock, 2007). A1 and A3 are Gi-
coupled, while A2A and A2B are Gs-coupled receptors which inhibit
and trigger, respectively, cyclic AMP (cAMP)-mediated signaling. A2A
receptors are highly expressed in the brain and have been implicated in
diverse neuropathologies, including PD, ischemic brain injury, traumatic
brain injury and schizophrenia (Chen et al., 2007; Matos et al., 2015).
A2A receptors on glial cells and their impact on the neuroinflammatory
and neuromodulatory processes are likely to be involved in these dis-
eases. Indeed, the A2A receptor regulates astrocytic functions (Matos,
Augusto, Agostinho, Cunha, & Chen, 2013) and has been implicated in
AD (Albasanz, Perez, Barrachina, Ferrer, & Martin, 2008; Huang and
Mucke, 2012). Astrocytic A2A receptors seem to affect the ability of
Ab peptide to suppress glutamate uptake, which could be one of the
mechanisms of excitotoxicity in AD (Matos et al., 2012). Although
microglia also expresses A2A receptors, increased levels of A2A recep-
tor expression in humans with AD are found only in astrocytes. Similar
to AD humans, aging mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein
1214 |
LIU ET AL.
 also have increased levels of astrocytic A2A receptors (Orr et al.,
2015). Conditional genetic removal of these receptors enhanced mem-
ory in these mice, suggesting that inhibiting astrocytic A2A receptors
might be considered as a therapeutic strategy for memory enhance-
ment. In line with this speculation, there has been some evidence
showing that caffeine, whose main target is A2A receptors, can
improve normal memory function or even prevent AD symptoms in
older adults (Arendash and Cao, 2010; Borota et al., 2014; Carman,
Dacks, Lane, Shineman, & Fillit, 2014). However, the case is not clear,
because deletion of astrocytic A2A receptors disrupts glutamate home-
ostasis, leading to psychomotor and cognitive impairments which
resemble schizophrenia (Matos et al., 2015).
3.9 | Meteorin pathway
Meteorin was first identified as a retinoic-acid-responding gene
involved in glial differentiation and regulation of axonal extension
(Nishino et al., 2004). It is a fairly long peptide - 291 amino acids in the
mouse, including a 21 amino acid signaling peptide. Meteorin is mainly
produced and secreted by astroglia and, in addition to the effects on
glia and neurons, also acts on endothelial cells (Park et al., 2008). Lenti-
viral overexpression of meteorin protected striatal neurons from exci-
totoxicity caused by quinolinic acid in vivo (Jorgensen et al., 2011) and
reversed hypersensitivity in rat models of neuropathic pain (Jorgensen
et al., 2012). Meteorin is upregulated in reactive astrocytes in a photo-
thrombotic ischemia mouse model and functions as a negative feed-
back effector in reactive gliosis (Lee et al., 2015). However, the cellular
receptor(s) for meteorin are still unknown. It has been reported that
meteorin acts through the Jak-STAT3 pathway to promote glial differ-
entiation in neural stem cells (Lee, Han, Lee, Park, & Kim, 2010). How-
ever, exogenous treatment of astrocytes with meteorin did not
activate the same pathway (Lee et al., 2015). This might be due to the
existence of more than one meteorin receptor, with different signaling
mechanisms. Nevertheless, once identified, this receptor may become
an interesting therapeutic target for neuroprotection.
3.10 | Metabotropic octadecaneuropeptide (ODN)
receptor
The CNS is sensitive to oxidative stress due to its high metabolic rate
and
high
levels
of
unsaturated
lipids.
ODN
is
a
peptide
(QATVGDVNTDRPGLLDLK) generated through the proteolytic cleav-
age of the 86-amino acid precursor protein “diazepam-binding inhibi-
tor” which is expressed by astrocytes (Burgi, Lichtensteiger, Lauber, &
Schlumpf, 1999; Malagon et al., 1993), although probably not com-
pletely exclusively (Alho, Harjuntausta, Schultz, Pelto-Huikko, & Bovo-
lin, 1991). ODN is a potent protective agent that prevents oxidative
stress-induced apoptosis and attenuates H2O2-evoked inhibition of
SOD and catalase activities in astrocytes (Hamdi et al., 2011). It has
been suggested that the anti-apoptotic activity of ODN is mediated
through a putative GPCR coupled to the adenylate cyclase/protein
kinase A pathway (Hamdi et al., 2012). Downstream of protein kinase
A, ODN induces ERK phosphorylation which, in turn, activates the
expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 and blocks the stimulation
by H2O2 of the proapoptotic gene Bax. The effect of ODN on the Bax/
Bcl-2 balance could possibly explain its antagonism of the deleterious
action of H2O2 on mitochondrial membrane integrity and caspase-3
activation (Hamdi et al., 2012, 2015). This anti-apoptotic effect of
ODN might be important in neurodegenerative diseases and stroke. If
a dedicated GPCR for ODN exists, it could be yet another potential
candidate for the development of small molecules agonists to be used
for the treatment of ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases.
3.11 | Serotonin 1A receptors on astrocytes as a
potential route for treatment of PD
The 5-HT1A receptor, one of 14 subtypes of metabotropic receptors
for serotonin, is widely distributed in brain (Barnes and Sharp, 1999).
As a key mediator of serotonergic signaling in the CNS, the 5-HT1A
receptor is involved in numerous effects of central serotonin, ranging
from cognition and emotion control to neurite outgrowth and synapse
formation (Filip and Bader, 2009; Ohno, 2011; Pucadyil, Kalipatnapu, &
Chattopadhyay, 2005).
Quite commonly, effects mediated through 5-HT1A receptors are
claimed to be mediated by neurons. However, since a very long time it
has been known that astrocytes also express serotonin receptors and
respond to serotonin with increases in [Ca21]i. Several studies pointed
at the therapeutic potential of astrocytic 5-HT1A receptors. Stimula-
tion of 5-HT1A receptors on astrocytes promotes astrocyte prolifera-
tion and neuroprotection both in vitro and in PD model mice (Miyazaki
et al., 2013). The 8-OH-DPAT [(R)-(1)28-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyla-
mino)tetralin hydrobromide], a full 5-HT1A agonist, enhances astrocyte
proliferation in mouse striatum. The 8-OH-DPAT significantly up-
regulates astrocytic antioxidant pathways by increasing the expression
of erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (Miyazaki et al., 2013) which acti-
vates genes involved in anti-oxidant defense (see below). Nrf2-
regulated genes are preferentially activated in astrocytes, boosting
their detoxification and antioxidant functions (Vargas and Johnson,
2009). Activation of Nrf2 in astrocytes protects dopaminergic neurons
from oxidative stress (Miyazaki et al., 2011; Wong et al., 2003). Protein
S100ß is expressed in various cell types with the highest level in the
cytoplasm of astrocytes (Selinfreund, Barger, Pledger, & Vaneldik,
1991) which release it into the extracellular space. Extracellular S100b
has autocrine effects and promotes astrocytic proliferation (Donato,
2003). Stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors on astrocytes leads to secre-
tion of S100b which seems to be protective at nanomolar concentra-
tions although deleterious at micromolar concentrations. It is therefore
conceivable that pharmacological modulation of 5-HT1A receptors on
astrocytes could be astro- and neuroprotective [for more detail see
(Miyazaki and Asanuma, 2016)].
3.12 | Targeting of astrocytic LDH enzymes to
treat epilepsy
In addition to glucose, lactate is a major source of energy in the brain,
and a significant amount of lactate is produced through glycolysis by
LIU ET AL.
| 1215
 astrocytes (Dienel, 2012; Gladden, 2004). LDH catalyzes the intercon-
version of pyruvate and lactate; some of which is transported from
astrocytes to neurons via the so called “lactate shuttle” (Chih and Rob-
erts Jr., 2003; Pellerin and Magistretti, 1994). In addition, lactate may
have a signaling role in the brain (Tang et al., 2014), see also our recent
review (Mosienko et al., 2015).
In epilepsy where activity of hyperexcitable neurons is uncontrolla-
bly synchronized, abundant energy for these activities has to be sup-
plied (Bertram, Zhang, Mangan, Fountain, & Rempe, 1998). Expectedly,
high rates of glucose metabolism and elevated activity of LDH have
been shown in human epilepsy and in animal models (Dufour, Koning,
& Nehlig, 2003). A recent study suggested that the effectiveness of a
ketogenic diet against epilepsy is linked to bypassing glycolysis in astro-
cytes (Sada et al., 2015). It was found that that inhibition of LDH
hyperpolarised neurons, reducing their excitability, and that this could
be reversed by pyruvate, which supports the notion of it being a meta-
bolic, rather than receptor mediated action. It turned out that stiripen-
tol, which is sometimes used to treat epilepsy, is an LDH inhibitor.
Moreover, an analog of stiripentol was found which proved to be
effective in vivo in a rodent epilepsy model, thus potentially setting up
a new class of anti-epileptic therapies (Sada et al., 2015). Other findings
also implicate lactate in epilepsy, for example, altered level and cellular
distribution of monocarboxylate transporters (Perez et al., 2012).
In contrast, some studies suggested that lactate can be neuropro-
tective (Jourdain et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2012).Therefore, reduction of
lactate production by LDH inhibitors is a double-edged sword strategy
since compromising neuroprotection is undesirable. This issue requires
further exploration using new models and, perhaps, other species but
mice.
3.13 | Nrf2-ARE pathway
Maintaining redox homeostasis in the brain is essential for survival.
One critical pathway through which the cell regulates its antioxidant
defense is the Nrf2-antioxidant response element (ARE) (Johnson and
Johnson, 2015) which is a cis-acting regulatory element controlling
expression of phase II detoxifying and antioxidant genes (Rushmore,
Morton, & Pickett, 1991; Rushmore and Pickett, 1990). Nrf2 is a cyto-
plasmic protein sequestered by actin-bound protein Keap1 (Kelch ECH
associating protein) (Itoh et al., 1999; Zipper and Mulcahy, 2002).
Under normal unstressed conditions, Nrf2 is anchored to Keap1 and
rapidly degraded (Itoh et al., 2003; McMahon, Itoh, Yamamoto, &
Hayes, 2003). This process seems to be much more powerful in neu-
rons than in astrocytes (Jimenez-Blasco, Santofimia-Castano, Gonzalez,
Almeida, & Bolanos, 2015). Oxidative stress or exposure to electro-
philic agents that react with Keap1 slow down Nrf2 degradation and
lead to its nuclear accumulation. Nrf2 binding to the ARE drives
expression of several detoxifying and antioxidant genes including SOD,
GCL, GSH synthase, GSH peroxidase, GSH reductase and g-glutamine
cysteine synthase, boosting anti-oxidant defence (Kensler, Waka-
bayash, & Biswal, 2007; Sykiotis and Bohmann, 2010). Hence, the
Nrf2-ARE pathway is considered a high-value therapeutic target (de
Vries et al., 2008; Johnson and Johnson, 2015; van Muiswinkel and
Kuiperij, 2005). It is preferentially activated in astrocytes while neurons
largely depend on astrocytes for the antioxidant defense (Kraft, John-
son, & Johnson, 2004; Lee, Calkins, Chan, Kan, & Johnson, 2003; Shih
et al., 2003). Therefore, unsurprisingly, many studies report that activa-
tion of the Nrf2 pathway in astrocytes is neuroprotective (Calkins, Var-
gas, Johnson, & Johnson, 2010; Chen et al., 2009; Gan, Vargas,
Johnson, & Johnson, 2012; Vargas, Johnson, Sirkis, Messing, & John-
son, 2008). For example, astrocyte-specific overexpression of Nrf2 pro-
tects
dopaminergic
neurons
in
MPTP-injected
Nrf2-deficient
parkinsonic mice (Chen et al., 2009). For further information see (Buen-
dia et al., 2016; Joshi and Johnson, 2012).
Numerous cell-based and in silico screens have identified Nrf2-
activating compounds (Schaap, Hancock, Wilderspin, & Wells, 2013;
Wang et al., 2013; Williamson et al., 2012; Wu, McDonald, Liu, Chagu-
turu, & Klaassen, 2012), including triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-
1,9(11)-dien-28-oate-methylamide (CDDO-MA), puerarin, sulforaphane,
CDDO-ethyl amide and others. Nrf2 activators demonstrated activity in in
vitro and in vivo in different neurodegenerative mouse models, protecting
neurons, decreasing the accumulation of aberrant proteins and increasing
life span (Buendia et al., 2016; Joshi and Johnson 2012). The existing data
are strongest for PD, ALS, and multiple sclerosis models, but the therapeu-
tic potential of this pathway in AD and HD is under investigation. In con-
clusion, the Nrf2–ARE pathway is definitely a promising target in
neurodegenerative diseases with several classes of small molecules
already demonstrated to act as its inducers.

| CONCLUDING REMARKS
The mechanisms and pathologies mentioned in this review by no
means exhaust the list of known astroglial neuroprotective or thera-
peutic mechanisms. For example, astrocytes could be an important tar-
get for antidepressants which block re-uptake of noradrenaline (Hertz,
Chen, Gibbs, Zang, & Peng, 2004) and there is evidence that statins
can reduce release of APOE from astrocytes (Naidu, Xu, Catalano, &
Cordell, 2002). Only about 30 years ago, the very thought that a cen-
trally acting drug may target an astrocytic receptor seemed implausible.
For instance, monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) which is a target for the
antidepressant deprenil and is localized almost exclusively in astrocytes
(Riederer et al., 1987), has recently attracted attention because it can
be used as an activator for pro-drugs that, after the reaction with
MAO-B, become cytotoxic for glioma cells, which typically upregulate
MAO-B (Sharpe and Baskin, 2016). Irrespective of glioma treatment,
MAO-B potentially could be used for local activation of other astroglia-
targeted molecules.
To sum up, the neurocentric view of brain function and disease
has been challenged by extensive data supporting the physiopathologi-
cal and therapeutic potential of astroglia. A solid body of evidence now
indicates that harnessing the natural capacity of astrocytes to protect
neurons is a promising clinical strategy. Modulation and protection of
astrocytes could in some cases become a more effective therapeutic
approach than the attempts to directly modify neuronal function or to
directly protect neurons from various insults or degeneration.
