Abstract
Background: The relationship between body size and prostate cancer risk, and in particular risk by tumour
characteristics, is not clear because most studies have not differentiated between high-grade or advanced stage
tumours, but rather have assessed risk with a combined category of aggressive disease. We investigated the
association of height and adiposity with incidence of and death from prostate cancer in 141,896 men in the
European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort.
Methods: Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and
95% confidence intervals (CIs). After an average of 13.9 years of follow-up, there were 7024 incident prostate
cancers and 934 prostate cancer deaths.
Results: Height was not associated with total prostate cancer risk. Subgroup analyses showed heterogeneity in the
association with height by tumour grade (Pheterogeneity = 0.002), with a positive association with risk for high-grade but not
low-intermediate-grade disease (HR for high-grade disease tallest versus shortest fifth of height, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.18–2.03).
Greater height was also associated with a higher risk for prostate cancer death (HR = 1.43, 1.14–1.80). Body mass index
(BMI) was significantly inversely associated with total prostate cancer, but there was evidence of heterogeneity by
tumour grade (Pheterogeneity = 0.01; HR = 0.89, 0.79–0.99 for low-intermediate grade and HR = 1.32, 1.01–1.72 for high-
grade prostate cancer) and stage (Pheterogeneity = 0.01; HR = 0.86, 0.75–0.99 for localised stage and HR = 1.11, 0.92–1.33
for advanced stage). BMI was positively associated with prostate cancer death (HR = 1.35, 1.09–1.68). The results for
waist circumference were generally similar to those for BMI, but the associations were slightly stronger for high-grade
(HR = 1.43, 1.07–1.92) and fatal prostate cancer (HR = 1.55, 1.23–1.96).
Conclusions: The findings from this large prospective study show that men who are taller and who have greater
adiposity have an elevated risk of high-grade prostate cancer and prostate cancer death.

 Background
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in
Europe, and the second most frequently diagnosed
cancer in men worldwide [1]. While relatively little is
known about prostate cancer aetiology, hormones
have been implicated; for example, circulating insulin-
like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations are associ-
ated with prostate cancer risk [2]. A relatively large
body size has been proposed to influence several
metabolic and hormonal mechanisms that can pro-
mote cancer development [3]. With increasing global
rates of overweight and obesity [4], the potential role
of obesity in carcinogenesis has become a significant
public health concern.
Several prospective studies have investigated the
association of body size with the development of
prostate cancer [3, 5–11]. The results have suggested
differences in associations of body size with risk
according to prostate tumour characteristics [12], but
relatively few studies have investigated whether body
size is related to a higher risk of clinically relevant
aggressive prostate cancer [3, 7–9]. The latest World
Cancer Research Fund meta-analysis reported that
height was related to total prostate cancer and ‘ad-
vanced’ prostate cancer, including as ‘advanced’ pros-
tate cancer various aggressive forms of the disease, but
not differentiating between stage, grade and prostate
cancer death because of the small number of available
studies with data on these separate outcomes [12].
This meta-analysis also reported that obesity was asso-
ciated with ‘advanced’ prostate cancer. The latest
meta-analysis published in a peer-reviewed journal
classified incident prostate cases into two categories
(‘localised’ or ‘advanced’) using a combination of
Gleason score, World Health Organization (WHO)
grading system, tumour node metastasis (TNM) stage,
Jewett–Whitmore staging system and prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) levels [13]. Therefore, more studies of
the association of body size with prostate cancer
separately by both grade and stage are needed.
The current study is an extended analysis of the
association between body size and prostate cancer
incidence in the European Prospective Investigation
into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), with an additional
5 years of follow-up (13.9 compared to 8.5 years in the
previous publication) and almost three times the num-
ber of incident cases (7024 compared to 2446 cases,
including 726 compared to 580 high grade, and 1388
compared to 499 advanced stage cases), and a substan-
tial number of deaths from prostate cancer (n = 934)
[14]. Herein, we sought to examine the association of
height and adiposity at baseline with both prostate
cancer risk by tumour characteristics and with prostate
cancer death.
Methods
Study cohort
EPIC is a multicentre prospective cohort study designed
to investigate the relationships between diet, lifestyle,
environmental factors and cancer risk. All participants
gave informed consent, and approval of the study was
obtained from the Internal Review Board of the Inter-
national Agency for Research on Cancer (Lyon, France)
and from ethics committees at the participating institu-
tions. The full list of all local ethics committees is
provided in Additional file 1: Table S1. The methods of
recruitment (questionnaires, anthropometric measure-
ments and blood samples) and study design have been
previously described [15]. The EPIC cohort consists of
519,978 participants (of whom approximately 150,000
are men) from 23 centres in 10 European countries. Nearly
all EPIC participants are white European. In the present
study, we describe data for men from 19 centres in 8 of
these countries; no data were available for France, Naples
(Italy), Norway, and Utrecht (Netherlands) because these
sub-cohorts only included women. Men were not eligible
for this analysis if they had previously been registered as
having cancer at the time of completing the baseline ques-
tionnaire (other than non-melanoma skin cancer), if they
had missing dates of prostate cancer diagnosis or follow-
up, or if they had no anthropometric data. The study
cohort for these analyses comprised 141,896 men.
Follow-up for prostate cancer incidence and vital status
Follow-up for incident prostate cancer was provided
through record linkage to population cancer registries in
Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the
United Kingdom. In Germany and Greece, follow-up
was active and a combination of methods was used, in-
cluding health insurance records, municipality registries,
hospital- or physician-based cancer and pathology regis-
tries, and active follow-up of study participants and their
next of kin; self-reported incident cancers were verified
through medical records. Vital status follow-up was
collected by record linkage with regional and/or national
mortality registries or by active follow-up (in Germany
and Greece). A total of 7024 men developed malignant
prostate cancer (code: C61) according to the 10th
Revision of the International Statistical Classification of
Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death [16].
Data on TNM stage and histological grade were collected
from each centre, where possible. Grade was stratified as
low-intermediate (Gleason score of < 8 or grade coded as
well, moderately or poorly differentiated; n = 3749) or high
grade (Gleason score of ≥ 8, or grade coded as undifferenti-
ated; n = 726) (Additional file 1: Table S2). Advanced stage
cases were tumours that had spread beyond the prostate at
diagnosis (T3–T4 and/or N1–N3 and/or M1, and/or stage
coded in the recruitment centre as metastatic, n = 1388).
Perez-Cornago et al. BMC Medicine  (2017) 15:115

 Localised stage cases were those confined within the pros-
tate and with no metastases at diagnosis (TNM staging
score of ≤ T2 and N0/Nx and M0, or stage coded in the
recruitment centre as localised, n = 2634). Fatal cases were
men who died of prostate cancer (n = 934).
Assessment of anthropometrics and other predictor
variables
The anthropometry protocols in the EPIC study centres
have been previously described in detail [17]. An-
thropometric data were directly measured by trained
study personnel in most of the participants, but it was
self-reported in the majority of participants from EPIC-
Oxford, although the accuracy of these self-reported
data has been validated [18]. Briefly, weight and height
were measured with participants wearing no shoes.
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in metres squared (kg/m2).
Waist circumference was measured either at the nar-
rowest torso circumference or at the midpoint between
the lower ribs and iliac crest or a combination of these
methods. Hip circumference was measured at the level
of the largest lateral extension of the hips or over the
buttocks. To compute the waist to hip ratio (WHR),
waist circumference was divided by hip circumference.
Each participant’s anthropometric data were corrected
for the clothing worn during measurement in order to
reduce heterogeneity due to protocol differences be-
tween centres [17]. Weight, height, waist circumference
and hip circumference were missing for 640 (0.4%), 391
(0.3%), 13,285 (9.3%) and 15,657 (11.0%) participants,
respectively, and these individuals were not included in
analyses that include these variables.
Baseline data on lifestyle, health status and socio-
demographic characteristics were collected via standardised
questionnaires, including diet, medical history, lifetime
history of tobacco smoking and alcoholic beverage con-
sumption, physical activity [19], marital status, occupational
history and level of education [15]. However, screening data
were not available in these analyses.
Statistical analysis
Analyses of the association of anthropometric factors
and covariates with prostate cancer risk were conducted
by using Cox proportional hazards regression, and
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
were calculated. The date of last follow-up ranged from
January 2011 in Germany to October 2013 in Spain. Age
was used as the underlying time variable and data were
stratified by centre and age at recruitment (<50, 50–
54.9, 55–59.9, 60–64.9, 65–69.9, and ≥ 70 years) in all
models. Entry time was defined as age at recruitment,
while exit time was age at censoring (i.e. age at last
follow-up, first diagnosis of incident cancer, loss to
follow-up or death, whichever came first). Exit time for
the analysis of prostate cancer death was age when par-
ticipants died due to the prostate tumour or censoring
(other cause of death, lost to follow-up or end of follow-
up period for each centre, whichever was first). To check
for violation of the proportional hazards assumption we
used time-varying covariates and the Schoenfeld resid-
uals, which indicated no evidence of deviation from the
proportional hazards assumption. Potential non-linear
associations between the anthropometric variables and
prostate cancer risk were evaluated using likelihood ratio
tests comparing the model with the anthropometric vari-
able entered as an ordered categorical (ordinal) variable to
a nested model with the categorical variable treated as con-
tinuous, and no evidence of non-linearity was observed.
Tests for linear trend were conducted using continuous
values for each anthropometric variable. Multivariable
models were adjusted for known or suspected risk factors
for prostate cancer, including education level (less than
university, university graduate, missing), smoking status
(never, former, current, missing), marital status (married,
not married, missing), diabetes (yes, no, missing), and
physical activity (inactive, moderately inactive, moderately
active, active, missing) [20].
The
following
categories
for
the
main
exposure
variables were used: (1) height (fifths, and per 10 cm
increase); (2) BMI (fifths, per 5 kg/m2 increase, and as
predefined WHO categories [21] (<25, 25–29.9, and ≥
30 kg/m2)); and (3) waist circumference (fifths, per
10 cm increase, and as predefined WHO categories [22]
(<94, 94–101.9, ≥ 102 cm)). The secondary exposure
variables were: (1) hip circumference (fifths, and per
10 cm increase) and (2) WHR (fifths, per 0.1 unit
increase, and as predefined WHO categories [22]
(<0.90, ≥ 0.90)). The fifths were based on fifths of the
distribution among non-cases.
Likelihood ratio tests were used to examine the hetero-
geneity of the associations of the anthropometric variables
with risk of prostate cancer categorised according to histo-
logical grade (low-intermediate or high grade) and pros-
tate tumour stage (localised or advanced). For this, we
fitted stratified Cox models based on competing risks and
compared the risk coefficients and standard errors in the
subgroups of interest after excluding cases of unknown
stage or grade, as appropriate [23].
We also conducted supplementary analyses restricted
to high-grade tumours and prostate cancer death to
further examine the results from the main analysis. Tests
for heterogeneity of trends for the case-defined charac-
teristics (age at diagnosis (<65, ≥ 65 years) and time
between blood collection and diagnosis (<5, ≥ 5 years))
were obtained by fitting separate models for each
subgroup and assuming independence of the HRs using
a competing risk approach. For the non-case-defined
Perez-Cornago et al. BMC Medicine  (2017) 15:115 
Page 3 of 11
 factors (e.g. age at recruitment (<60, ≥ 60 years)), the
test for heterogeneity was assessed by using a likelihood
ratio test to compare the Cox models with and without
interaction terms for the anthropometric variable and
the relevant factor.
Sensitivity analyses was also performed by excluding
extreme values (percentiles outside 1–99); additionally
adjusting for total intake of energy, alcohol, fruit and
vegetables, red meat, processed meat, protein from dairy
sources or height; excluding men with missing values for
the main covariates; and using the waist circumference-
adjusted residuals of BMI and the BMI-adjusted resid-
uals of waist circumference by regressing these variables
in a linear regression model and using the residuals (that
are statistically independent of waist circumference or
BMI, respectively), as the exposures of interest [24].
Statistical analyses were performed with the Stata 14.0
statistical software package 16. All tests of statistical
significance were two-sided and P values below 0.05
were considered significant.
Results
After an average of 13.9 years of follow-up, a total of 7024
men were diagnosed with prostate cancer among the
141,896 men included in this study. Among the total
cases, there were 934 deaths from prostate cancer. The
mean age at diagnosis was 67.8 years (range, 41–95 years).
The main baseline characteristics of the participants
according to categories of BMI (<25, 25–29.9 and ≥ 30 kg/
m2) are shown in Table 1 (and by height and waist cir-
cumference in Additional file 1: Tables S3 and S4; the dis-
tribution of the study participants and of prostate cancer
cases by country is shown in Additional file 1: Table S5).
Participants with obesity at baseline were more likely to
be older, former smokers, moderately inactive and with a
lower level of education than were men of normal BMI.
Men with obesity were more likely to be missing informa-
tion on marital status, but of those men who provided
information on marital status at recruitment, men with
obesity were more likely to be married.
The relationship of height with prostate cancer risk is
shown in Table 2. When we compared the highest fifth
with the lowest, height was not associated with total pros-
tate cancer risk (HR = 1.06, 95% CI, 0.97–1.15; Ptrend =
0.3). There was evidence of heterogeneity by tumour
grade (Pheterogeneity = 0.002), with height being positively
associated with high-grade disease (HR = 1.54, 1.18–2.03;
Ptrend = 0.006), but not low-intermediate-grade disease
(HR = 0.96, 0.86–1.08; Ptrend = 0.2). Taller height was also
associated with a higher risk for prostate cancer death
(HR = 1.43, 1.14–1.80; Ptrend = 0.001). The risks of high-
grade disease and prostate cancer death increased by 21%
(HR = 1.21, 1.06–1.38) and 17% (HR = 1.17, 1.04–1.31),
respectively, with every 10 cm increment in height.
Total prostate cancer risk was inversely related to
BMI and waist circumference (Table 3); the HRs for
highest fifth versus lowest were 0.90 (0.83–0.97, Ptrend <
0.001) for BMI and 0.92 (0.84–1.00, Ptrend = 0.01) for waist
circumference. However, the association of BMI and waist
circumference with prostate cancer risk was found to differ
between different prostate cancer tumour characteristics.
For BMI and prostate cancer risk, there was evidence of
heterogeneity by tumour grade (Pheterogeneity = 0.01; HR =
0.89, 0.79–0.99 for low-intermediate-grade and HR = 1.32,

Cox regression analysis. All models are stratified by centre and age at recruitment and adjusted for education level (less than university, university graduate, missing), smoking status (never, former, current, missing),
marital status (married, not married, missing), diabetes (yes, no, missing), and physical activity (inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active, active, missing)
1P values for trend are obtained by entering the continuous anthropometric variable in the model

0.01; HR = 0.86, 0.75–0.99 for localised stage and HR =
1.11, 0.92–1.33 for advanced stage). Similarly, there was
significant heterogeneity in the association with waist
circumference by tumour grade (Pheterogeneity = 0.002; HR =
0.87, 0.77–0.99 for low-intermediate-grade and HR = 1.43,
1.07–1.92 for high-grade cancer), but not by tumour stage
(Pheterogeneity = 0.1). There were statistically significant
positive associations of prostate cancer death with BMI
(HR = 1.35, 1.09–1.68) and waist circumference (HR =
1.55, 1.23–1.96).
The associations of hip circumference and WHR with
prostate cancer risk are shown in Additional file 1:
Table S6. Total prostate cancer was inversely associated
with hip circumference (HR for highest versus lowest
fifth 0.86, 0.79–0.94). There was significant heterogeneity
for hip circumference by tumour grade (Pheterogeneity <
0.001; HR = 0.84, 0.75–0.95 for low-intermediate-grade
and HR = 1.37, 1.04–1.80 for high-grade cancer). WHR
was not associated with total prostate cancer incidence.
However, there was evidence of heterogeneity by cancer
grade (Pheterogeneity = 0.004) and stage (Pheterogeneity =
0.02); WHR was positively associated with high-grade
(HR = 1.46,
1.09–1.94,
Ptrend = 0.004)
and
advanced
stage (HR = 1.29, 1.05–1.58, Ptrend = 0.01), but not with
low-intermediate-grade and localised prostate cancer.
Hip circumference was significantly associated with risk
of death from prostate cancer (HR for highest versus
lowest fifth 1.43, 1.14–1.79), but no association between
WHR and prostate cancer death was observed.
When BMI, waist circumference and WHR were
categorised according to the WHO cut-off points, the
results were broadly similar to those for these vari-
ables categorised in fifths (Additional file 1: Table S7).
There was no evidence of heterogeneity for the associ-
ations of height, BMI and waist circumference with
high-grade prostate cancer and prostate cancer death by
age at recruitment (<60, ≥ 60 years), age at diagnosis
(<65, ≥ 65 years), or time between recruitment and diag-
nosis (<5, ≥ 5 years) (Additional file 1: Tables S8
(height), S9 (BMI) and S10 (waist circumference)).
The significant positive association of height, BMI and
waist circumference with high-grade prostate cancer and
prostate cancer death remained largely unchanged in the
sensitivity analysis. After excluding men with missing
data for covariates, we observed that the association of
waist
circumference
with
both
high-grade
prostate
cancer and prostate cancer death was slightly larger,
although the associations of height and BMI with risk
were somewhat attenuated and were no longer statisti-
cally significant. When we used waist circumference-
adjusted residuals of BMI as the exposure, the positive
association between BMI and prostate cancer death was
no longer statistically significant and the direction was
reversed (HR = 0.80, 0.51–1.25). When we used BMI-
adjusted residuals of waist circumference as the exposure
the association between waist circumference and prostate
cancer death was essentially unchanged.
Discussion
In this prospective analysis, men who were taller and with
greater adiposity had an elevated risk of high-grade pros-
tate cancer and death from prostate cancer. The associa-
tions were strongest for height and waist circumference.
Previous studies have found a positive association be-
tween height and risk of prostate cancer [3, 5, 12, 25–30].
In our study, this positive association was only significant
for high-grade prostate cancer and death from prostate
cancer. While several prospective studies have found a
positive association between height and death from pros-
tate cancer [3, 27, 28], to our knowledge, no previous
study has found a positive association between height and
high-grade prostate cancer risk [3, 29, 30]. However, this
might be due to the fact that not many studies have differ-
entiated between prostate cancer stage and grade of the
disease [12]. The mechanisms underlying this association
of height with aggressive disease are not fully understood.
Height is partly determined by genetic factors and it might
also be a marker of cumulative early-life growth factor
exposures, such as high IGF-I or childhood nutrition,
which may increase the risk of prostate cancer [2]. Taller
men have more cells (including stem cells) and larger
prostate volumes [31]. However, men with smaller pros-
tates have been found to have more high-grade/advanced
disease and higher progression rates [32].
Results
from
previous
prospective
studies
have
suggested that the association between obesity and
prostate cancer may vary significantly across tumour
characteristics [3, 6–9], with a positive association be-
tween adiposity and risk of aggressive (advanced stage
and high grade combined) prostate cancer [3, 6–9].
The association between genetically determined adi-
posity and prostate cancer risk has also recently been
examined in a large Mendelian randomisation study
[33]. No association was observed between genetic
score for adult BMI and WHR for total and aggressive
prostate cancer (defined as a Gleason score of ≥ 8, a
disease stage of ‘distant’
, a PSA level of > 100 ng/mL or
death from prostate cancer); however, associations
were not examined separately by tumour stage and
grade [33]. In our analysis, adiposity tended to be
positively associated with risk for high-grade tumours
and prostate cancer death, and inversely related to
non-aggressive prostate cancer tumours and total
prostate cancer, which is in accordance with previous
reports [9, 11, 34]. The association of obesity with
death might be for a specific tumour subtype such as
tumours with the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion [35].
Perez-Cornago et al. BMC Medicine  (2017) 15:115

 BMI adjusted for waist circumference probably reflects
lean body mass rather than adiposity. The positive
association between waist circumference and prostate
cancer death was the only one maintained in all of the
multiple sensitivity analyses. Although waist circum-
ference and BMI are highly correlated, waist circum-
ference has been proposed as a better marker of
adiposity for men [36].
In our analysis, adiposity markers tended to be posi-
tively associated with aggressive tumours and prostate
cancer mortality, and inversely related to non-aggressive
prostate cancer tumours and total prostate cancer. These
different associations by tumour characteristics may be
partly due to differences in prostate cancer detection in
men with obesity. Such men may be less likely to be
diagnosed with prostate cancer overall, and in particular
with early prostate cancer, because they have lower PSA
concentrations (perhaps due to an increased blood
volume since the total amount of PSA in blood does not
differ by body mass), are less likely to undergo a biopsy,
and are also likely to have larger prostates, making can-
cer detection more difficult [37]. It may be also more
difficult to perform a thorough digital rectal examination
on men with obesity. A reduced likelihood of early de-
tection and treatment might in turn lead to an elevated
incidence of aggressive disease and high prostate cancer
mortality in men with obesity [38]. However, several
possible biological mechanisms that may underlie the
association between obesity and prostate cancer death
have been proposed, including mechanisms that involve
insulin and the IGF-I axis, sex hormones, and inflamma-
tory and oxidative stress pathways. Obesity is associated
with disturbances in the IGF-I axis; an inverted U-shaped
association between BMI and IGF-I has been observed,
while BMI and concentrations of IGFBP-1 and -2 have
been shown to be inversely associated [39]. High circulat-
ing IGF-I levels are associated with an increased prostate
cancer incidence in this cohort [40] and in an individual
participant meta-analysis of prospective studies [2]. Partic-
ipants with obesity normally suffer from hyperinsulinemia,
which has been linked to prostate cancer risk [41] and
prostate cancer mortality [42]. Obesity is also related to a
decrease in free testosterone and changes in other sex
hormone concentrations [38]. Moreover, excess adiposity
may contribute to the activation of proinflammatory
signalling pathways [43] and higher oxidative stress [44],
both of which have been suggested to be linked to higher
prostate cancer risk [45, 46].
This study has several strengths and also some limita-
tions. The strengths include its prospective design, detailed
information on potential confounders, long follow-up, the
large sample size and number of incident cases, and the
availability of data on prostate cancer tumour characteris-
tics and mortality. Analyses by time to diagnosis showed
no evidence that the observed associations were due to
reverse causality. Although measurements of fat mass were
not available in this study, previous investigations have
shown that both BMI and waist circumference are strongly
correlated with total fat mass [47]. Participants in this
cohort might be considered to be late middle-aged adults,
since their mean age at recruitment was 52 years. In this
age group, and especially in older adults, the use of BMI as
a measure of overweight and obesity might be less sensitive
because ageing is associated with a decrease in muscle
mass and height [48]. It might therefore be argued that the
use of BMI in our cohort may lead to an underestimate in
the prevalence of obesity; however, we also use waist cir-
cumference, which has been found to be a better predictor
of total body fat, and especially of abdominal adiposity in
men, than BMI, because waist circumference is less influ-
enced by muscle mass [48]. The lack of screening data is a
limitation of this analysis. Information on tumour charac-
teristics was only available for a subset of cases (24.8% of
prostate cancer cases did not have any data on tumour
characteristics) and men with obesity were less likely to
have missing data on tumour stage and grade than were
men who were not overweight. Data on early-life factors,
including anthropometry, which may influence prostate
cancer occurrence [26, 49], were not available in the
current study.
Conclusion
In summary, the findings from this large European pro-
spective study provide evidence that men with greater
height and adiposity (high BMI and waist circumference)
have an elevated risk of high-grade prostate cancer and
prostate cancer death. The data presented illustrate the
complex association of adiposity and prostate cancer,
which varies by disease aggressiveness.
