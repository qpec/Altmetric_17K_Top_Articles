Abstract 
This article presents a practical roadmap for scholarly data repositories to implement data 
citation in accordance with the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles, a synopsis and 
harmonization of the recommendations of major science policy bodies. The roadmap was 
developed by the Repositories Expert Group,  as part of the Data Citation Implementation Pilot 
(DCIP) project, an initiative of FORCE11.org and the NIH BioCADDIE (https://biocaddie.org) 
program. The roadmap makes 11 specific recommendations, grouped into three phases of 
implementation: a) required steps needed to support the Joint Declaration of Data Citation 
Principles, b) recommended steps that facilitate article/data publication workflows, and c) 
optional steps that further improve data citation support provided by data repositories.

Introduction 
The Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles (JDDCP) published in 2014 (Data Citation 
Synthesis Group, 2014) and endorsed by a large number of scholarly and academic publishing 
organizations, lays out a set of principles on purpose, function and attributes of data citations, 
starting with stressing that data should be considered legitimate, citable products of research (M 
Altman, Borgman, & Crosas, 2015). The JDDCP condense the results of substantial prior studies 
on science policy and practice (King, Gary & Altman, Micah, 2007; Uhlir, 2012; CODATA-
ICSTI Task Group on Data Citation Standards and Practice, 2013).  
The JDDCP intentionally focuses on data citation principles, as the implementation of these 
principles will differ across disciplines and communities. The roadmap presented here aims to 
provide practical guidance for repositories on implementing these data citation principles with a 
focus on life sciences, based on earlier work in this area, in particular Starr et al. (2015) and 
Altman and Crosas (2013), and are consistent with recent recommendations regarding data, code 
and workflows (Smith, Katz, & Niemeyer, 2016; Stodden et al., 2016). 
Data repositories play a central role in data citation, as they provide stewardship and discovery 
services to find data, give persistent access to the data being cited, and provide unique identifiers 
and metadata needed for data citation. For data citation, repositories need to work closely with a 
variety of stakeholders, including publishers, reference manager providers, and of course 
researchers. Data citation practices and technologies supported by repositories will substantially 
assist development of new data discovery indexes such as BioCADDIE. 
Results 
The guidelines are grouped into three phases: required, recommended and optional. 
Implementing these guidelines takes time and resources, it is therefore not only critical to 
provide specific guidelines, but also to give guidance on priorities: work needed to support the 
Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles (required phase), additional work to facilitate 
article/data publishing workflows in collaboration with publishers (recommended phase), and 
extra work to support data citation that can be done by data repositories (optional phase). The 
Guidelines are summarized in Table 1, and discussed in detail in the text following the table.

Level 
# 
Guideline 
Required 
1 
All datasets intended for citation must have a globally unique persistent 
identifier that can be expressed as unambiguous URL. 
2 
Persistent identifiers for datasets must support multiple levels of 
granularity, where appropriate. 
3 
This persistent identifier expressed as URL must resolve to a landing page 
specific for that dataset. 
4 
The persistent identifier must be embedded in the landing page in 
machine-readable format. 
5 
The repository must provide documentation and support for data citation. 
Recommended 
6 
The landing page should include metadata required for citation, and ideally 
also metadata helping with discovery, in human-readable and machine-
readable format.  
7 
The machine-readable metadata should use schema.org markup in JSON-
LD format.  
8 
Metadata should be made available via HTML meta tags to facilitate use 
by reference managers. 
9 
Metadata should be made available for download in Bibtex and/or another 
standard bibliographic format. 
Optional 
10 
Content negotiation for schema.org/JSON-LD and other content types may 
be supported so that the persistent identifier expressed as URL resolves 
directly to machine-readable metadata. 
11 
HTTP link headers may be supported to advertise content negotiation 
options 
Table 1. Guidelines for Repositories. 
Details of each recommendation follow, with examples.  
1. Persistent identifiers 
A data citation must include a persistent method for identification that is machine actionable, 
globally unique, and widely used by a community (JDDCP, principle #4). For implementation 
by data repositories, this means: 
● Persistent method for identification. Unique identifiers, and metadata describing the 
data, and its disposition, must persist -- even beyond the lifespan of the data they describe 
(JDDCP, principle #6). As extension to this principle data repositories should make 
provisions to keep unique identifiers and metadata available beyond the lifespan of the 
data or repository, ideally in a well-recognized and accepted standard metadata format. 
● Machine actionable. The persistent identifier must be understood, and be resolvable, as 
an HTTP URI in accordance with the RFC 3986 (“RFC 3986 - Uniform Resource 
Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax,” 2005), including support for content negotiation 
(Treloar, 2011).

3 
● Globally unique. The identifier must use a prefix (namespace) if the identifier character 
string is only unique within a particular database, e.g. an accession number. 
For data repositories that are not using globally unique identifiers, the DCIP EG2 
Identifiers Expert Group is working on a bridging solution using common prefixes 
(“Prefix Commons,” 2016) and resolver services (identifiers.org and n2t.net).  
● Widely used by a community. Accession numbers, in combination with the database 
name for global uniqueness, are the most widely used identifiers in the life sciences. 
2. Persistent identifier granularity 
Persistent identifiers for datasets must support multiple levels of granularity to support both the 
citation of a specific version and/or individual dataset, as well the citation of an unspecified 
version of a dataset and/or a collection of primary data.  
In many domains, primary data is uniquely identified and cited as a collection of potentially 
many individual items. At the same time, these individual items need their own unique identifiers 
to support later reuse and recombination into different sets while maintaining the ability to cite 
the constituent data elements.  
An example is in the field of neuroimaging, where individual subject scans using a given 
imaging modality are the lowest level at which objects will be identified, while the primary 
publication will cite a collection level unique identifier. This imposes a requirement that lower-
level identifiers need to be able to be grouped via a collection identifier and accessed as set 
elements from the overall collection landing page (Honor, Haselgrove, Frazier, & Kennedy, 
2016). Another example is the BioStudies database (McEntyre, Sarkans, & Brazma, 2015), 
which can provide storage for all the underlying data links and files for a publication.  
Only in circumstances where multiple levels do not inherently exist in the data, i.e. no collections 
or other groupings exist, may this requirement be waived.  
3. Landing pages 
The persistent identifier expressed as HTTP URL must resolve to a specific landing page for that 
dataset or dataset collection. The persistent identifier expressed as HTTP URL must not resolve 
to the data itself (Starr et al., 2015), or to other representations of the metadata, unless special 
protocols such as content negotiation are used (see guideline 7 below).

and underlying data, taken with permission from (“Data Citations: A Primer,” 2016).  
 
Landing pages provide definitive information (metadata) on how the dataset should be cited, 
other descriptive information about the dataset, as well as data accessibility and licensing 
information. Repositories should provide a landing page for every dataset or collection of 
datasets intended to be cited, which could be single entries, sets of entries, the entire repository 
or a curated database (Starr et al., 2015).  
Reference to a statement describing the data and metadata persistence policies of the repository 
should also be provided at the landing page. Data persistence policies will vary by repository but 
should be clearly described (Starr et al., 2015). Figure 2 provides an example.

4. Persistent identifiers on landing pages 
To verify that a persistent identifier resolves to a correct landing page, the persistent identifier 
must be embedded in the landing page in human-readable and machine-readable formats. This 
enables basic data citation by reference managers, and enables minimal validation by the

publisher of persistent identifiers cited in documents. The persistent identifier should be found 
somewhere on the landing page, but is ideally embedded in schema.org markup and/or using 
HTML meta tags. 
Example schema.org/JSON-LD 
<application type="application/ld+json"> 
    {  
        "@id": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.q447c/3" 
    }  
</application> 
Example HTML meta tags 
<meta name="DC.identifier" content="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.q447c/3"> 
5. Documentation and author support 
The repository must provide documentation about how data should be cited, how metadata can 
be obtained, and who to contact for more information. The DCIP FAQ Expert Group provides 
example documentation for data repositories. 
6.  Metadata on landing pages 
Landing pages should provide metadata required for data citation in both human- and machine-
readable format. The latter includes that access to the metadata should not require Javascript, 
cookies or login. The landing page should show the citation metadata in human-readable form, 
e.g. formatted in one or more citation styles common to the community in a Cite this 
Dataset field and, possibly, provide means of copying/downloading the citation as text. The 
landing page should also show all versions, or link to a page with version information. A visible 
link to machine-readable metadata should be provided. 
The metadata elements needed for data citation are given in Table 2.

All metadata fields required for citation are part of Dublin Core (with the exception of version), 
the core schema.org specification, and by extension Bioschemas (“BioSchemas,” 2016), as well 
as the DataCite and DATS metadata schemata. 
In addition to the metadata required for citation, it is recommended to provide additional 
metadata on landing pages – again in human-readable and machine-readable formats – that help 
with data discovery, as shown in Table 3. 
The metadata standards Dublin Core, schema.org and DataCite by their very nature of being 
generic only provide some metadata helpful for discovery, while DATS can provide much more 
detailed information about a biomedical dataset. Further information can be found in the 
DataMed DATS specification.

Table 3: Important discovery metadata for Data Repositories. Key:  
* DATS provides much more detailed metadata to describe a biomedical dataset;  
** related datasets can have part/whole relations (IsPartOf, etc.), version relations (IsVersionOf, etc.) or 
reference relations (references); 
*** related publications reference a dataset published previously, reference a dataset published in parallel 
with the publication, or otherwise document a dataset 
 
Information about related datasets should be provided where possible, as should information 
about related publications. They provide important information that can help with discovery. 
When a data repository knows about a publication citing a dataset, this information should be 
included in the metadata, complementing the information about the dataset found in the citing 
publication and enabling navigation between publication and dataset in both directions. 
7. Metadata on landing pages using schema.org/JSON-LD 
All dataset landing pages should provide machine-readable metadata using schema.org markup 
in JSON-LD format. JSON-LD is the easiest way to represent schema.org metadata, and is also 
used to represent DATS metadata in schema.org format (Gonzalez-Beltran & Rocca-Serra, 
2016). The JSON-LD should be embedded in the HTML page using a <script 
type="application/ld+json"> tag.

For further examples please use DataCite Search (“DataCite Search,” 2016), which has 
embedded schema.org/JSON-LD metadata on every search result page for more than three 
million datasets. 
8. Metadata via HTML Meta Tags 
Data repositories should offer machine-readable metadata on landing pages using Highwire, 
PRISM (Hammond, Hannay, & Lund, 2004), and/or Dublin Core HTML meta tags. These 
HTML meta tags are currently the preferred method of reference managers to extract the 
persistent identifier or full citation metadata from landing pages, as reference managers currently 
don’t routinely support schema.org/JSON-LD metadata extraction. 
Example 
<meta name="DC.identifier" content="doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.727206" 
scheme="DCTERMS.URI" /> 
<meta name="DC.title" content="Landings of European lobster (Homarus 
gammarus) and edible crab (Cancer pagurus) from 1615 to 2009, Helgoland, 
North Sea" /> 
<meta name="DC.creator" content="Schmalenbach, Isabel" /> 
<meta name="DC.creator" content="Mehrtens, Folke" /> 
<meta name="DC.creator" content="Janke, Michael" /> 
<meta name="DC.creator" content="Buchholz, Friedrich" /> 
<meta name="DC.publisher" content="PANGAEA" /> 
<meta name="DC.date" content="2011-01-28" scheme="DCTERMS.W3CDTF" /> 
<meta name="DC.type" content="Dataset" /> 
9. Metadata via downloadable file in standard bibliographic format 
Repositories should provide a download link in a common bibliographic format – e.g. .bib 
(BibTex file format) and/or .ris (RIS file format) – on the landing page of the dataset. The file 
should include all metadata required for a data citation.  
Example: BibTex 
@data{25240_2014, 
  author = {Figueiredo, Dalson and Rocha, Enivado and Paranhos, Ranulfo  
  and Alexandre, José}, 
  publisher = {Harvard Dataverse}, 
  title = {How can soccer improve statistical learning?}, 
  year = {2014}, 
  doi = {10.7910/DVN/25240}, 
  url = {https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/25240} 
} 
Example: RIS

10. Content negotiation for machine-readable metadata 
Persistent identifiers expressed as HTTP URI must by default resolve to the landing page for that 
dataset (see guideline #3). Data repositories and identifier service providers such as 
identifiers.org or DataCite in addition may implement content negotiation for the persistent 
identifier expressed as HTTP URI, returning machine readable metadata in various formats. 
Content negotiation is for example supported by identifiers.org and DataCite and can return 
metadata in XML, RDF, Bibtex and other metadata formats. 
Example: Image Attribution Framework (IAF) 
curl -H "Accept: application/xml" 
http://iaf.virtualbrain.org/lp/10.18116/C6WC71 
 
In addition, the HTML version of this page has a link to the XML (available without content 
negotiation at http://iaf.virtualbrain.org/lp/xml/10.18116/C6WC71). 
Examples: DataCite 
curl -LH "Accept: application/ld+json" http://doi.org/10.5061/DRYAD.8290N 
 
curl -LH "Accept: application/vnd.citationstyles.csl+json" 
http://doi.org/10.5061/DRYAD.8290N 
 
Metadata in application/vnd.citationstyles.csl+json format are used as input by many 
reference managers, e.g. Zotero or Mendeley. 
11. Support HTTP link headers 
The persistent identifier (see guideline #2) and available content negotiation options (see 
guideline #9) may be provided in a HTTP link header (Van de Sompel & Nelson, 2015). This 
facilitates discovery of content negotiation options and makes it easier to fetch the identifier from 
large landing pages, as only a HTTP head request is needed). 
Example 
curl -I https://search.datacite.org/works/10.5061/dryad.q447c/3

Methods 
This roadmap was developed based on numerous discussions of the DCIP Repositories Early 
Adopters Expert Group, led by Martin Fenner and Mercè Crosas, including two in-person 
workshops in February (Boston) and June (San Diego) 2016, and in close coordination with the 
other DCIP expert groups. The resulting guidelines have been widely circulated. A course on the 
guidelines and how to implement them, was held at the FORCE11 Scholarly Communication 
Institute (FSCI) in August of 2017. The course instructors were Martin Fenner and Gustavo 
Durand, with guest speaker Natasha Noy from the schema.org initiative.  
At the conclusion of the course, a hackathon was coordinated by Fenner and Durand, with Noy 
helping in schema.org metadata integrations. This hackathon was open to the course participants 
as well as other interested attendees at FSCI. Small teams that included staff from several data 
repositories were formed and each worked on implementing at least one of the 10 guidelines for 
their respective data repositories. Overall, the hackathon focused on machine-readable metadata 
in landing pages, specifically in schema.org JSON-LD, and some repositories had implemented 
schema.org support by the end of the hackathon. 
The course and hackathon provided valuable feedback regarding the guidelines, e.g. that 
providing metadata in bibtex format for download should be recommended not optional. It 
served as both a propagation mechanism for the guidelines and a means of validation with 
practitioners.  
An informal poll was taken of course participants as part of this validation.  They represented a 
self-selected sample of technologists working for various biomedical data repositories and well-
positioned to implement the guidelines.  Results are shown in Table 4. Based on this limited

survey, we see that most repositories we queried have implemented, or are in the process of 
implementing, the required guidelines. Also, of the recommended and optional guidelines, the 
surveyed attendees expressed most interest in implementing machine-readable metadata in 
landing pages and in link headers. The guidelines’ overall approach was strongly endorsed.   
We expect based on our survey, that many data repositories already follow all required 
recommendations, but most need to do more work for those that are recommended or optional.

indicated “partial implementation” – we were conservative and only counted complete implementations.  
Conclusions 
This document provides a roadmap for scholarly data repositories to implement support for data 
citation. Most if not all required steps have already been implemented by many data repositories, 
and little if any work is needed by them to fully support the Joint Declaration of Data Citation 
Principles. More work is still needed to implement the recommended steps, and in particular 
support for schema.org/JSON-LD markup for metadata is still at an early stage. Data repositories 
that have implemented the required and recommended steps might be interested to look into the 
optional steps for extra data citation support. 
The Data Citation Implementation Pilot and this document focus on data citation support in 
scholarly data repositories. Using persistent identifiers, standard machine-readable metadata and

landing pages of course not only supports data citation, but also facilitates data discovery. Data 
discovery requires more specific metadata than the metadata needed for data citation, and it is 
facilitated by a central index of all datasets. The NIH BD2K bioCADDIE project, of which the 
Data Citation Implementation Pilot is a small part, is working on standard metadata for 
biomedical data with DATS, and on a central index to search a large number of biomedical 
datasets with DataMed (“DataMed | bioCADDIE DDI,” 2016). The European ELIXIR (“ELIXIR 
Data for life,” 2016) project (life sciences) and DataCite (all disciplines) are also working on 
standard metadata and a search index for data discovery. Both Elixir and DataCite are closely 
collaborating with bioCADDIE in these activities. 
The data citation roadmap for scholarly data repositories described in this document is an 
important step towards full data citation support by data repositories. Going forward a lot of 
work is needed to implement these guidelines, and ongoing coordination amongst data 
repositories, and with publishers and other important stakeholders will be essential in this 
activity.
