ABSTRACT
Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is the most common prion
disease in humans and has been iatrogenically transmitted through corneal graft
transplantation. Approximately 40% of sCJD patients develop visual or oculomotor
symptoms and may seek ophthalmological consultation. Here we used the highly
sensitive real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay to measure postmor-
tem prion seeding activities in cornea, lens, ocular fluid, retina, choroid, sclera, optic
nerve, and extraocular muscle in the largest series of sCJD patient eyes studied by
any assay to date. We detected prion seeding activity in 100% of sCJD eyes, repre-
senting three common sCJD subtypes, with levels varying by up to 4 log-fold
among individuals. The retina consistently showed the highest seed levels, which in
some cases were only slightly lower than brain. Within the retina, prion deposits
were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the retinal outer plexiform layer in
most sCJD cases, and in some eyes the inner plexiform layer, consistent with synap-
tic prion deposition. Prions were not detected by IHC in any other eye region. With
RT-QuIC, prion seed levels generally declined in eye tissues with increased distance
from the brain, and yet all corneas had prion seeds detectable. Prion seeds were
also present in the optic nerve, extraocular muscle, choroid, lens, vitreous, and
sclera. Collectively, these results reveal that sCJD patients accumulate prion seeds
throughout the eye, indicating the potential diagnostic utility as well as a possible
biohazard.
IMPORTANCE Cases of iatrogenic prion disease have been reported from corneal
transplants, yet the distribution and levels of prions throughout the eye remain un-
known. This study probes the occurrence, level, and distribution of prions in the
eyes of patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). We tested the larg-
est series of prion-infected eyes reported to date using an ultrasensitive technique
to establish the prion seed levels in eight regions of the eye. All 11 cases had de-
tectable prion seeds in the eye, and in some cases, the seed levels in the retina ap-

 proached those in brain. In most cases, prion deposits could also be seen by immu-
nohistochemical staining of retinal tissue; other ocular tissues were negative. Our
results have implications for estimating the risk for iatrogenic transmission of sCJD
as well as for the development of antemortem diagnostic tests for prion diseases.
KEYWORDS Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, RT-QuIC, eye, prion
P
rion diseases are rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorders with no available
treatment (1–3). Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is the most common prion disease in
humans, and is classified as sporadic, familial, or iatrogenic (4). Sporadic Creutzfeldt-
Jakob disease (sCJD) has been transmitted iatrogenically from prion-contaminated
corneal grafts, dura mater transplants, human cadaveric growth hormone, and neuro-
surgical instruments (5–9). Although the underlying factors that initiate sCJD are
unclear, the cause of prion disease is PrPSc, an infectious misfolded and aggregated
form of the cellular prion protein, PrPC (10, 11). PrPC is expressed ubiquitously with the
highest levels in neural tissues, including retina, although PrPC expression is higher in
brain than retina (12–15).
sCJD is often challenging to diagnose, in part due to the clinical and pathological
heterogeneity in the disease phenotype (16–21). The disease is markedly influenced by
the PRNP prion gene sequence at polymorphic codon 129 (methionine/valine) and by
the PrPSc conformation, which is type 1 or type 2 depending on the protease-resistant
aggregate core size (22, 23). sCJD has been divided into six phenotypic variants, or
subtypes, that differ by clinical presentation, rate of decline, and pathological targets in
the brain and are known as subtype MM1/MV1, VV2, MV2, MM2-cortical, MM2-thalamic,
or VV1 (23–25). Approximately one-third of cases have both type 1 and type 2 PrPSc
(MM1/2, MV1/2, and VV1/2) (23).
Visual disturbances are a common early presenting symptom of sCJD (approxi-
mately 10 to 20% of cases) often associated with the MM1/MV1 subtype (26, 27), and
can include diplopia, supranuclear palsies, and loss of vision (26, 28, 29). Throughout
the disease course, more than 40% of cases have visual or oculomotor symptoms (26).
In a limited number of reports, the electroretinogram sometimes shows a significant
decrease in the �-wave, potentially due to abnormalities in the outer plexiform layer
where PrPSc has been detected (30, 31). By late-stage disease, blindness develops in 25
to 42% of sCJD patients (26, 28), possibly from spongiform degeneration, neuronal loss,
and PrPSc deposits in the thalamus (lateral geniculate) or primary visual cortex.
In addition to the CNS lesions that develop within the visual circuitry, prions have
also been directly detected in ocular tissues from a small number of cases, prior to the
development of RT-QuIC. In two studies of variant CJD (vCJD), caused by the transmis-
sion of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) to humans, PrPSc was readily detected
in the retina and optic nerve but not in the cornea, lens, vitreous fluid, or sclera by
Western blot or immunohistochemical labeling (15, 19). For sCJD, the few reports
describing prion detection in the eye show different results, potentially due to the
sensitivity of the technique used. PrPSc was observed in the retina of two patients by
immunohistochemical labeling and Western blot (subtypes VV2 and MM1) (15, 32), but
not in a third patient studied by a highly sensitive Western blot assay (19). Notably,
these studies were conducted prior to the development of the highly sensitive RT-QuIC
technique.
As the distribution and extent to which prions are established in the eyes of sCJD
patients remain unclear, the risk of iatrogenic prion transmission through ophthalmic
procedures is unknown (33, 34). For example, corneal transplantation is an increasingly
common surgery, with 185,576 corneal transplantations performed in 116 countries in
2012, more than ever reported previously (35). The United States leads in corneal
procurement and transplantation per capita, with approximately 64,000 corneal trans-
plants per year (35). Corneal grafts from prion-infected patients have led to two
probable and three possible cases of iatrogenic prion transmission, and prion infectivity
has been reported from human cornea inoculated into mice (36). The first reported case

 of a corneal graft transmission of sCJD occurred in 1974, with death in the recipient
27 months after transplantation. In this case, the diagnosis of CJD was confirmed at
autopsy in the donor and recipient (37). Another probable transmission occurred in a
45-year-old woman who developed sCJD after receiving a corneal transplant 30 years
earlier from a donor who died from subacute spongiform encephalopathy (38). Three
additional cases developed sCJD after corneal transplantation, with the diagnosis
confirmed at autopsy in the recipients, but with an incomplete history on the donors
(39–41). These reports of iatrogenic prion spread prompted us to investigate the
frequency and level of prions in the eyes of sCJD patients to better understand the
transmission risk as well as the potential for diagnostic assay development.
Highly sensitive and specific biochemical assays have revolutionized PrPSc detection
and now enable the measurement of minute levels of PrPSc (attograms to femtograms)
from tissues and body fluids, including nasal brushings and CSF (42, 43). The real-time
quaking-induced conversion assay (RT-QuIC) detects the misfolding of recombinant
monomeric prion protein by prion aggregates or “seeds” within a prion-infected
sample (44, 45). Application of RT-QuIC assays to the antemortem diagnosis of sCJD
using CSF and nasal brushings has allowed provisional diagnostic sensitivities and
specificities approaching 100% (42, 43). Using this extraordinarily sensitive detection
method, we investigated the level and distribution of prion seeding activity in the eye
tissues of eleven patients who died from sCJD.
RESULTS
Clinical features of sCJD patients. We analyzed the eyes from eleven cases of
pathologically confirmed sCJD representing three subtypes as well as six controls
having nonprion diseases. All eleven patients were enrolled in the UCSF Memory and
Aging Center clinical prion research program in a study approved by the UCSF
Committee on Human Research. Participants were evaluated clinically for one or more
visits for neurologic deficits as well as for PRNP mutations and genotype, and diagnos-
tically by CSF analysis, EEG, and brain MRI. None had mutations in PRNP or any history
of a known iatrogenic exposure to prions, and the clinical and diagnostic features were
consistent with sporadic CJD. At PRNP polymorphic codon 129, all three genotypes
were represented: MM (n � 5), MV (n � 5), and VV (n � 1).
Three of eleven cases (27%) had visual disturbances such as transient monocular
blindness and blurry or double vision (patients 1, 2, and 5), three had impaired
visuospatial skills (patients 2, 9, and 11), and no patients had visual field deficits
(Table 1). Four of 11 cases had visual signs, including nystagmus, slow ocular pursuit,
and increased saccade latency, but these were not considered visual symptoms. Retinal
imaging using optical coherence tomography was performed on three sCJD patients
(patients 6, 10, and 11) and revealed a modest decrease in peripapillary retinal nerve
fiber (pRNFL) layer thickness compared to 20 healthy control eyes (age-balanced

P � 0.07) (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material).
Diffusion MRI revealed focal regions of high cortical intensity (cortical ribboning)
with restricted diffusion in all cases, with three cases showing cortical ribboning in the
occipital (visual) cortex (patients 2, 4, and 11). In addition to cortical involvement, five
cases had both striatal and thalamic involvement (patients 2, 3, 6, 8, and 10), three had
striatal involvement (patients 4, 7, and 9), and one had thalamic involvement (patient
6). The diagnosis of sCJD was confirmed biochemically by PrPSc detection in the brain
(Fig. S2 and S3).
PrPSc levels in six brain regions. PrPSc levels in the occipital cortex varied among
the patients, with the type 1 cases having higher PrPSc levels than the type 2 cases
(Fig. S2). We also measured PrPSc by Western blotting samples from six brain regions
from each patient, specifically parietal and occipital or frontal cortex, basal ganglia,
thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. The PrPSc levels in each brain region varied
within a patient. The thalamus and occipital cortex commonly accumulated high levels
of PrPSc, and the cerebellum showed the lowest levels in eight of ten cases examined
(Fig. S3).
Prion seeding activity measured by RT-QuIC. We next tested the PrP seeding
activity by RT-QuIC analysis in eight eye regions, which were extraocular muscle, optic
nerve, cornea, lens, vitreous fluid, retina, choroid, and sclera. We found that all eleven
sCJD patient eyes were positive for prion seeding activity and showed the highest
seeding activity in the retina (Fig. 1). Interestingly, an endpoint dilution assay revealed
that seeding activity in eye tissues varied among the patients by up to 4 log-fold
(Fig. 1). Prion seed levels in the retina were significantly higher than the extraocular
muscles, optic nerve, cornea, lens, vitreous fluid, and sclera (Fig. 1 and 2) (P � 0.0001,
ANOVA with Tukey’
s posttest). The lens and vitreous fluid tended to show the lowest
seeding activity in most patients and were negative in three patients and one patient,
respectively. The high seed levels in the vitreous from two patients may have been due
to spread from the retinal layer, as both patients had very high seed levels in the retina.
Similarly, the choroid consistently showed high seed levels that were significantly
higher than cornea, lens, and vitreous fluid; prion seeds emanating from the retinal
layer may have contributed to the high levels. The cornea and extraocular muscle had

 lower seeding activity relative to the retina (Fig. 1 and 2). None of the six control cases
showed seeding activity in any ocular tissue (Fig. 2).
Prion seeding activity in the retina ranged from levels 101-fold to 104-fold lower than
sCJD brain (Fig. 1), potentially due to lower PrPC expression, and higher seeding activity
did not correlate with the presence of visual symptoms. We assessed whether the
seeding activity in the retina correlated with age, gender, disease duration, PRNP
genotype, or sCJD subtypes, but found no evidence of a correlation (Fig. S4). A previous
report suggested that the sCJD subtype might influence the levels of prion deposits in
retina (32). We found that the VV2 subtype showed the highest seed levels in retina,
with the MM1-2 and MV1-2 mixtures also tending to show high levels. The MM/MV1
cases instead showed a broad distribution of seeding activity throughout the eye.
Retinal PrPSc distribution by immunohistochemistry. To determine the distribu-
tion of prions within the retina, we immunolabeled all eyes for PrP. Nearly all sCJD
patients showed PrPSc deposits in the retina (9 of 11, 82%, of cases) with discrete
aggregates visible in the plexiform layers, which consist of dense networks of neuronal
synapses. All nine positive retina cases had PrPSc deposits in the outer plexiform layer,
whereas one case (VV2) showed intense staining and also developed strong PrPSc
labeling in the inner plexiform layer (Fig. 3). The other subtypes primarily differed in the
staining intensity, but not the stain distribution. Deposits typically appeared as focal
oval intensely stained aggregates approximately 4 to 5 �m in diameter at evenly
spaced intervals every 15 to 20 �m (Fig. 3). The VV2 case also showed fine granular
deposits throughout the plexiform layers. No PrPSc deposits were visible in other
(nonretinal) ocular tissues in any case. Neither the non-CJD control eyes (Fig. 3) nor the
control IgG isotype-labeled sCJD eyes showed any PrPSc deposition.

 DISCUSSION
We detected high prion seed levels in 100% of sCJD patient eyes from three
common subtypes and two mixed subtypes, MM1/MV1, VV2, MV2, MM1-2, and MV1-2,
using the exceptionally sensitive and quantitative RT-QuIC technique. In more than half
the cases, prion seeding activities in retina were remarkably high and approached levels
in brain, consistent with efficient prion conversion in neural tissue. The VV2 subtype
showed the highest prion seeding activities in the retina and visible deposits in the
inner and outer plexiform layers (46). In all other subtypes, retinal prion seeding
activities were at least 0.5-log lower; however, prion deposits were consistently visible
by IHC in the outer plexiform layer. Ironside and colleagues also reported prion
immunolabeling in the plexiform layers from a VV2 patient and an MM1 sCJD patient,
with more widespread deposition in the VV2 case as seen here (15, 32). We found that
strong prion immunolabeling in the retina correlated with high prion seeding activity.
In all sCJD cases, prion seeding activity accumulated in other (nonretinal) ocular
tissues, specifically the choroid, sclera, optic nerve, and cornea, as well as extraocular
muscles, lens, and vitreous of most eyes. We noted that high prion seed levels in the
optic nerve correlated with high seed levels in the retina, but not in the cornea.
Surprisingly, all corneas contained low to moderate prion seeding activity, and levels
did not vary substantially among the patients. These differences may reflect prion entry
by multiple cranial nerves transporting PrPSc, as prions may be spreading from prion-
infected brain into the retina by retrograde axonal transport in the optic nerve (47–50).
Prions may be accumulating in the abundant small nerves within the cornea, originat-
ing from cranial nerves V and VII.
Our findings support the World Health Organization classification of eye compo-
nents as having high prion infectivity and have implications for patient safety. As the
early-disease phase of sCJD often includes visual symptoms (27–29), patients with sCJD
will often have diagnostic assessments performed by an ophthalmologist, potentially
contaminating instruments. Experimental models have shown that prions spread from
brain to the retina in mice by 60% of the incubation period, prior to the onset of clinical
disease (51). Although in humans it is not yet clear when prions accumulate in the eye,
the finding of prion seeding activity in all sCJD eyes bolsters recommendations for
single-use instruments or other decontamination procedures to prevent iatrogenic
prion transmission. Cadaveric corneas have been a source of iatrogenic prion trans-
mission, and grafts are commonly performed (35). With the increased frequency of
corneal grafting worldwide, optimizing biosynthetic substitutes would be a justified
research priority and is currently under development in multiple laboratories (54, 55).
In all sCJD patient eyes examined, PrPSc aggregates were highly visible in the
posterior retina, an accessible CNS window that could potentially be exploited for the
early diagnosis of prion disease. For example, an electroretinogram is an antemortem,
noninvasive diagnostic tool that may reveal early electrical abnormalities, particularly
considering the prion deposits in synaptic plexi. Because other protein aggregates such

 as amyloid-�, �-synuclein, and tau may also spread from brain to retina, it would also
be important to continue to evaluate eyes from patients having more common
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’
s disease, synucleinopathies, and
tauopathies, particularly in light of recent findings showing the prion-like spread of
protein aggregates through the CNS (56–59).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and controls. This prospective study of sCJD
patients was initiated in July 2015 and continued through July 2017. Patients were referred to the UC San
Francisco (UCSF) Memory and Aging Center for rapidly progressive neurologic disease. All patients had
extensive clinical testing, including brain MRI, CSF analysis for 14-3-3, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and
total tau. All were classified as probable sCJD by UCSF clinical and radiological diagnostic criteria (60, 61)
and were ruled out for genetic prion disease by PRNP analysis (done through the National Prion Disease
Pathology Surveillance Center [NPDPSC], Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH). The mean age
of sCJD patients at disease onset was 63 � 2 years (mean � SE), and consisted of seven women and four
men. The duration of clinical neurologic signs ranged from 1.5 to 27 months (mean � SD: 11 �
9 months). Control cases consisted of five men and one woman and ranged from 51 to 90 years old
(mean � SD: 70 � 14 years). Two of the control cases died of neurodegenerative disease (Alzheimer’
s
disease) and four controls died of nonneurologic disease (neoplasia).
Study oversight. This study was approved by the ethics committee at UC San Francisco. Informed
consent was received from all patients (IRB Study Number: 10-04905). All ocular and brain tissues
examined at UCSD and NIAID were obtained on autopsy; this testing was therefore exempt from review
by the NIH Office of Human Subjects Research Protections.
PRNP genotyping. The open reading frame of the PRNP gene was sequenced from all patient
samples to test for any mutations in the PrP sequence and to determine the genotype at polymorphic
codon 129 (methionine or valine; performed at the NPDPSC, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland,
OH). Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen brain tissue samples using Qiagen QIAamp DNA minikit
(Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer’
s protocol and a 760-bp fragment corre-
sponding to the human PrP gene (residues 5 to 258) was PCR amplified using primers HRM-F (5=-TAT
GTGGACTGATGTCGGCCTCTGCAAGAAGCGC-3=) and HRM-R (5=-CCACCTCAATTGAAAGGGCTGCAGGTGGA
TAC-3=) with defined cycling conditions (62, 63). The Met/Val polymorphism at codon 129 and mutation
of the PrP gene coding region were determined by deep (63) or direct Sanger sequencing as previously
described (22, 62). Nucleotide sequences from both deep and Sanger sequencing were analyzed using
DNAStar Lasergene Software Suite v.7.1.0 (Madison, WI). There were no mutations discovered in any of
the patients. Patients consisted of 129 MM (5), MV (5), and VV (1).
Optical coherence tomography. Antemortem retinal imaging was performed bilaterally using Spect-
ralis spectral-domain OCT (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany, Eye Explorer software version
1.9.10.0) by two trained technicians under standard ambient conditions (illuminance level of 80 to 100 foot-
candles). Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was obtained with a 360°RNFL-B circle scan
(100 ART; 1,536 A scan per B scan) located at 3.4 cm from the center of the optic nerve head.
Macular volumetric scans consisting of 19 single horizontal axial B-scans (ART � 9; 1,536 A scan per
B scan) were acquired in a 20- by 15-degree raster horizontal scan centered on the fovea. Intraretinal
layer segmentation was executed to quantify macular RNFL, ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner nuclear layer
(INL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), and outer plexiform layer (OPL) through the Viewing Module 6.0 in a
semiautomatic way, with manual correction of software errors. Scans that violated international consen-
sus quality control criteria (OSCAR-IB) were excluded from the analysis (64, 65). We followed the APOSTEL
guidelines to report OCT studies (66).
Brain and ocular tissue collection. Ocular and brain tissues were collected at autopsy from eleven
sCJD patients and six controls. One eye was immediately frozen and the second eye was formalin-fixed.
Brain sections were collected from six to nine brain regions and frozen. The formalin-fixed eye tissues
were immersed in 98% formic acid for 1 h, and postfixed in formalin prior to paraffin-embedding and
sectioning. Frozen eyes were thawed and the following tissue sections were collected for analysis by
RT-QuIC using clean sterile blades to avoid contamination among the tissues: extraocular muscle, optic
nerve, vitreous fluid, lens, cornea, retina, choroid, and sclera.
Immunohistochemistry for PrPSc in the eye. Four-�m sections of brain were cut onto positively
charged silanized glass slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or immunostained using antibodies for
PrP (12F10). For PrP staining, sections were deparaffinized and incubated for 5 min in 96% formic acid, then
washed in water for 5 min, treated with 5 �g/ml of proteinase K for 7 min, and washed in water for 5 min.
Sections were then placed in citrate buffer (pH 6) and heated in a pressure cooker for 20 min, cooled for 5
min, and rinsed in distilled water. Sections were incubated with anti-PrP 12F10 (Cayman Chemical; 1:200) for
45 min followed by anti-mouse IgG conjugated to biotin (Jackson Immunolabs; 1:250) for 30 min, followed
by streptavidin-HRP (Jackson Immunolabs; 1:2,000) for 30 min. Sections were then incubated with DAB
reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and counterstained with hematoxylin.
Western blot for PrPSc in the brain. Brain samples were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) (20% brain homogenate final [wt/vol]) using a Beadbeater tissue homogenizer. PrPSc was concen-
trated from brain samples by performing sodium phosphotungstic acid (NaPTA) precipitation prior to
Western blotting (19). Briefly, 50-�l aliquots of 10% brain homogenate in an equal volume of 4% sarkosyl
in PBS were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, then digested with an endonuclease (Benzonase
[Sigma]) and with 100 �g/ml proteinase K at 37°
C for 30 min. After addition of NaPTA, MgCl2, and

 protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche), extracts were incubated at 37°
C for 30 min and centrifuged at
18,000 � g for 30 min at 37°
C. Pellets were resuspended in 0.1% sarkosyl in PBS prior to electrophoresis
and blotting. Membranes were incubated with monoclonal antibody POM1 (discontinuous epitope at
C-terminal domain [67]) followed by incubation with an HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary
antibody (Jackson Immunolabs). The blots were developed using a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL
detection kit, Thermo Scientific) and visualized on a Fuji LAS 4000 imager. Quantification of PrPSc signal
was performed using Multigauge V3 software (Fujifilm).
PrPSc subtyping. sCJD is classified into six main subtypes and three mixed subtypes, depending on
the codon 129 polymorphism and the electrophoretic profile of the protease-resistant PrPSc core
fragment size, which is 21 kDa (type 1) or 19 kDa (type 2) (23). We assessed the PK-resistant core size and
compared the PrPSc levels in the occipital cortex among the patients. Three sCJD subtypes were
represented, consisting of MM1/MV1 (n � 4), MV2 (n � 2), and VV2 (n � 1), as well as MM1-2 and MV1-2
mixtures (n � 4).
Ocular tissue homogenate preparation for RT-QuIC analysis. Eye homogenates (10% [wt/vol])
were prepared in PBS containing 2 mM CaCl2 and 0.25% (wt/vol) collagenase A (Roche). Glass homog-
enization beads (1 mm; Biospec) were added to the sample in homogenization buffer and tissues were
homogenized for 1 min using a Beadbeater tissue homogenizer (Biospec). The samples were then
incubated at 37°
C under shaking conditions overnight, homogenized for 1 min, and centrifuged at
2,000 � g for 2 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and stored at �80°
C for subsequent
analysis.
RT-QuIC analysis for PrP seeding activity in eye tissues. The RT-QuIC reaction mix was composed
of 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 300 mM NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml recombinant Syrian hamster PrP (residues
90 to 230; rPrPSen; GenBank accession number K02234), 10 �M thioflavin T (ThT), 1 mM EDTA, and 0.001%
SDS. Aliquots of the reaction mix (98 �l) were loaded into each well of a black 96-well plate with a clear
bottom (Nunc) and seeded with 2 �l of eye tissue homogenates at different dilutions. The plate was
sealed (plate sealer film, Nalgene Nunc International) and incubated at 55°
C in a BMG FLUOstar Omega
plate reader at cycles of 1 min shaking (700 rpm double orbital) and 1 min rest. ThT fluorescence
measurements (450 � 10 nm excitation and 480 � 10 nm emission; bottom read) were taken every 45
min. ThT fluorescence threshold for a positive result was calculated as the mean of all values from
negative eye tissues plus three standard deviations. For quantitation, endpoint dilution assays were
performed using Spearman-Kärber analyses to estimate the seeding dose (� SE) giving ThT positivity in
50% of technical replicate wells (SD50) (44, 68).
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean � SEM unless otherwise indicated with group
differences tested using standard parametric methods (one-way ANOVA with Tukey’
s multiple compar-
ison test). P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Data availability. The authors will make data fully available and without restriction.
