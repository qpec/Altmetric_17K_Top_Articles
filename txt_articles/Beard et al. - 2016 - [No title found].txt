Trends and patterns in vaccination
objection, Australia, 2002e2013
C
onsiderable media and public
attention has been focused in
recent years on the refusal
by some parents to vaccinate their
children as recommended by health
authorities.
Vaccination
coverage
has often been purported to be
declining
nationally
as
a
result,
particularly in more affluent inner-
city suburbs (for example, 1).
Until the end of 2015, the Australian
Childhood
Immunisation
Regis-
ter
(ACIR)
recorded
registered
objection to vaccination based on
personal, philosophical or religious
beliefs.
Registration
of
objection
required a vaccination provider to
complete a conscientious objection
form; this was necessary only when
the parents wished to remain eligible
for family assistance payments from
the federal government or, in some
states, to be able to enrol their child
in childcare. It is therefore likely that
ACIR data have not captured all in-
stances
of
parental
objection
to
vaccination.
Only
one
published
Australian
study
has
reported
an
in-depth
analysis of vaccination objections, a
national survey conducted in 2001.2
Our study aimed to examine trends
in registered vaccination objection
and differences in the geographic
and
demographic
distribution
of objection across Australia, and
to
assess
the
contribution
of
unregistered objection to incomplete
vaccination.
Methods
The ACIR was established in 1996
by incorporating demographic data
recorded by Medicare for all enrolled
children under the age of 7 years.3
Children not enrolled in Medicare
can also be added to the ACIR with
a
supplementary
number.
“Fully
vaccinated” status is assessed at three
key milestones: 12 months of age (for
vaccines due at 2, 4 or 6 months);
24 months of age (for vaccines due at
12 or 18 months); and 60 months of
age (for vaccines due at 48 months).
The algorithms used for calculation
of fully vaccinated status at these
milestones have been described pre-
viously.4
We
defined
“partially
vaccinated” children as those with
one or more vaccinations recorded,
but who were not fully vaccinated
with respect to the vaccines due at the
relevant schedule points.
We examined the following four
subgroups of children, defined ac-
cording to ACIR data:
�
objection to vaccination and no
vaccinations recorded;
�
objection to vaccination and one
or more vaccinations recorded;
�
no objection to vaccination and
no vaccinations recorded; and
�
no objection to vaccination and
partially vaccinated.
We examined trends over time for
cohorts aged 12 months to less than
7 years for the period 2002e2013.
Children
under
12
months
old
were excluded to allow time for
parents to have registered an objec-
tion to vaccination. We analysed
the 2013 data further, mainly for
children born 1 January 2007 e 31
December 2012.
The area of residence of children
was defined as “major cities”, “inner
regional”, “outer regional”, “remote”
or “very remote” according to the
Accessibility/Remoteness Index of
Australia (ARIAþ).5 We combined
the inner and outer regional cate-
gories into a single “regional” cate-
gory,and the remote and very remote
categories into a single “remote”
category.
If a child was registered with Medi-
care later than 365 days after birth,
Abstract
Objectives: To examine geographic and demographic trends in objection to
vaccination in Australia.
Design: Cross-sectional analysis of Australian Childhood Immunisation
Register (ACIR) data (2002e2013) for children aged 1e6 years.
Main outcome measures: Immunisation status according to whether an
objection had been registered, and remoteness and socio-economic
status of area of residence. Registration of children with Medicare after
12 months of age was used as a proxy indicator of being overseas-born.
Results: The proportion of children affected by a registered vaccination
objection increased from 1.1% in 2002 to 2.0% in 2013. Children with a
registered objection were clustered in regional areas. The proportion was
lower among children living in areas in the lowest decile of socio-economic
status (1.1%) than in areas in the highest socio-economic decile (1.9%). The
proportion not affected by a recorded objection but who were only partly
vaccinated for vaccines due at 2, 4 and 6 months of age was higher among
those in the lowest decile (5.0% v 3.4%), suggesting problems of access
to health services, missed opportunities, and logistic difficulties. The
proportion of proxy overseas-born for whom neither vaccinations nor an
objection were recorded was 14 times higher than for other children
(17.1% v 1.2%). These children, who are likely to be vaccinated although this
is not recorded on the ACIR, resided predominantly in major cities.
Conclusions: There was a small increase in registered objection rates since
2002. We estimate that 3.3% of children are affected by registered or
presumptive (unregistered) vaccination objection, which suggests that the
overall impact of vaccination objection on vaccination rates has remained
largely unchanged since 2001. Incomplete records, barriers to access,
and missed opportunities are likely to be responsible for most other
deficiencies in vaccination coverage.

overseas.
We compared children living in post-
codes in the bottom and top 10% of all
postcodes with regard to economic
resources, according to the Socio-
Economic Indexes for Areas: Index of
Economic Resources.6 For small area
analyses, we used Australian Bureau
of Statistics (ABS) Statistical Area 3
(SA3) areas.7 Maps werecreated using
MapInfo version 12.0 (Pitney Bowes)
and ABS census boundary informa-
tion. The ABS Postal Area to SA3
Concordance 20118wasusedtomatch
ACIR postcodes to SA3.9 If a postcode
was matched to more than one SA3,
the SA3 with the greatest proportion
of the population of that postcode was
used.
Due to the extremely large num-
ber of children included in this
study, statistical comparisons were
unnecessary.
Ethics approval
Ethics approval was not required for
this study, as de-identified popula-
tion-based data were used only for
routine public health surveillance.
Results
The percentage of children aged 1e6
years with a vaccination objection
recorded on the ACIR increased from
1.1% (17 430 of 1 612 864 children) in
2002 to 2.0% in 2013 (1.1% [19 244/
1 785 421]
with
no
vaccinations
recorded;
0.9%
[15 917/1 785 421]
with
one
or
more
vaccinations
recorded; Box 1).
In contrast, the percentage of chil-
dren for whom neither vaccinations
nor
an
objection
were
recorded
decreased
from
4.3%
(69 684/
1 612 864) in 2002 to 2.4% (42 578/
1 785 421) in 2013. The percentage of
children who were partially vacci-
nated
with
respect
to
vaccines
scheduled at 2, 4 and 6 months of
age and for whom no objection was
recorded
also
declined,
from
7.1% (114 221/1 612 864) in 2002 to
3.4%
(60 094/1 785 421)
in
2013
(Box 1).
In 2013, the proportion of children
with a recorded vaccination objection
living in the lowest 10% of postcodes
with regard to economic resources
was about half that of those living in
the highest 10% (1.1% [1664/152 279]
v 1.9% [4598/236 649]; Box 2).
The proportion of children in the
lowest socio-economic decile who
were partially vaccinated and for
whom there was no recorded objec-
tion was 50% higher than for those
living in the most advantaged decile
for vaccinations due at 2, 4 and
6 months of age (5.0% [7644/152 279]
v3.4%[8016/236 649]),35%higherfor
vaccines due at 12 and 18 months of
age
(5.4%
[6677/124 271]
v
4.0% [7909/198 126]), and 20% higher
for vaccines due at 48 months of age
(4.5% [2023/44 897] v 3.7% [2807/
75 890]).
The percentage of children with a
vaccination objection recorded on the
ACIR was 2.5% (11 342/462 237) in
regional
areas,
1.8%
[22 973/
1 268 599)
in
major
cities,
and
1.4% (536/39 062) in remote areas.
Children likely to have been born
overseas (using the proxy measure of
late Medicare registration) were less
likely to have a recorded vaccination
objection
than
other
children
(1.4% [1754/123469] v 2.0% [33407/
1661952]), but much more likely to
have neither an objection nor any
vaccinations recorded (17.1% [21134/
123 469] v 1.2% [19 619/1661952]), or
to have no recorded objection but to be
partially vaccinated with respect to
vaccines due at 2, 4 and 6 months of
age
(19.6%
[24 241/123 469]
v
2.1% [35205/1661952]). Seventy-five
per cent (145 091/194757) of proxy
overseas-born children lived in major
cities, compared with 71% of other
children (1 123 799/1 576 567); they
comprised
52%
of
children
with
neither an objection nor any vaccina-
tions recorded (21 134/40 753).
Some children with a vaccination
objection documented on the ACIR
were recorded as being fully vacci-
nated at the relevant age milestones.
At 12 months of age, 23% of all chil-
dren
with
a
recorded
objection
(7946/35 161) were fully vaccinated;
in 90% of these cases, the objection
had been registered after receiving
the third dose of the diphtheriae
tetanusepertussis
vaccine.
At
24 months of age, 15% of all chil-
dren

a
recorded
objection

 (4606/30910) were fully vaccinated;
in 78% of these cases the objection
had been registered after receiving
the
first
dose
of
the
measlese
mumpserubella (MMR) vaccine. At
60 months of age, 12% of all children
with a recorded objection (3685/
31 228)
were
fully
vaccinated;
in
25% of cases, the objection had been
registered after receiving the second
dose of the MMR vaccine (data not
shown).
The proportion of children with an
objection to vaccination recorded on
the ACIR varied substantially at the
small area level. Most areas with
high levels of recorded objection
were in regional zones, with marked
clustering in northern New South
Wales and south-east Queensland
(Box 3).
Discussion
Registered objection to vaccination in
Australia, as a percentage of the total
population aged from 12 months to
less than 7 years, increased by less
than one percentage point between
2002 and 2013. During this period,
the percentage of children with no
recorded objection but incompletely
vaccinated (either no vaccinations or
only some scheduled vaccinations
recorded) decreased, while vaccina-
tion coverage remained relatively
high
and
stable.4,9
Contrary
to
frequent claims in the media, this
suggests that overall levels of objec-
tion (registered and unregistered)
have not changed, and increases in
registered objection may have been
driven by increased awareness that
registration preserved eligibility for
family assistance payments, which
rose in value during this period.10
Among the 5.8% of children in
2013 who were incompletely vacci-
nated but with no recorded objec-
tion, potential explanatory factors
include
unregistered
objection,
reporting and recording errors, and
problems of access, opportunity and
logistics.
Our data show that for 2.4% of
children there was no recorded ob-
jection but also no scheduled vacci-
nations recorded on the ACIR; of
these children, 52% were likely to
have been born overseas. This is
consistent withfindings from a recent
study in Western Australia which
found that 44% of children with no
recorded objection or vaccinations
had been born and vaccinated over-
seas; only 28% involved an unregis-
tered
objection.11,12
Extrapolating
from these data, we estimate that the
proportion of children in our study
with
no
recorded
vaccinations
because of an unregistered objection
was about 0.7% (ie, 28% � 2.4%;
Box 4). Our finding that the per-
centage
of
children
with
no
recorded objection and no recorded
vaccinations
is
highest
in
major
cities and lowest in regional areas is
consistent with the greater propor-
tion of overseas-born children in
major cities.13 Estimation of true
vaccination coverage needs to take
overseas-born status into account,
particularly at the small area level
in
major
city
locations,
where
recording and reporting errors may
explain reports of apparently lower
coverage.14,15
Another
important
subgroup
of
incompletely vaccinated children in-
cludes the 3.4% of children for whom
there was no recorded objection, but
who were only partially vaccinated
with respect to vaccines due at 2, 4
and 6 months of age. This group
included a substantially higher pro-
portion of children living in the bot-
tom 10% of socio-economic status
postcodes,
suggesting
delayed
vaccination
caused
by
problems
related to disadvantage, logistic dif-
ficulties, access to health services,
and missed opportunities in primary,
secondary and tertiary health care.
Incomplete vaccination has previ-
ously been associated with socio-
economic factors in Australian and
overseas studies.16,17
In the absence of alternative data, we
assumed that the ratio between the
proportions of children affected by
registered objection with some and
no
vaccinations
(ie,
0.9:1.1)
was
similar to that for partially unvacci-
nated and completely unvaccinated

 children with unregistered objection.
We consequently estimated that the
proportion of children who were
partially vaccinated as the result of an
unregistered objection was about
0.6%. The estimated total proportion
of
children
affected
by
a
regis-
tered or unregistered objection to
vaccination, ranging from those who
have received no vaccinations to
those who have received some or
delayed
vaccinations,
was
thus
3.3% (Box 4).
This
figure
includes
fully
vacci-
nated children with a registered ob-
jection. Our findings indicate that, at
earlier vaccination milestones, the
objection was typically registered
after scheduled vaccinations were
given. At the 60 months’ milestone,
however, appropriate vaccinations
had usually been given after the
objection
had
been
registered,
which may reflect a change of mind
by the parent(s) and subsequent
(ie, delayed) vaccination.
The distribution of recorded vacci-
nation

shows
marked
geographical clustering, posing a risk
of
local
disease
outbreaks.18-21
Teasing
out
the
various
issues
contributing to incomplete vaccina-
tion will be particularly important
now that data on registered objection
is no longer collected: from 1 January
2016, philosophical and religious
beliefs are no longer legally valid
reasons for exemption from vaccina-
tion
requirements
for
receiving
family assistance payments.22 Our
findings provide a baseline against
which to track trends in objection,
although
limitations
include
our
use of ACIR data without directly
interviewing
parents,
and
the
limited nature of recent information
on the completeness and accuracy of
ACIR data. The most recent national
survey of parents of incompletely
vaccinated
children
estimated
in
2001 that 2.5e3.0% of the annual
birth cohort were affected by parents
who had registered an objection or
had
significant
concerns
about
vaccination.2,23 Our estimate (3.3%)
was only slightly higher, suggesting
that there has been little change in the
overall impact of vaccination objec-
tion since 2001. A national survey,
focusing on incompletely vaccinated
children, equipped to evaluate data
quality,
and
using
personal
in-
terviews to assess parental attitudes,
would
allow
verification
of
our
findings.
