Environmental factors, including pesticides, have been linked to autism and neurodegenera-
tion risk using retrospective epidemiological studies. Here we sought to prospectively identify
chemicals that share transcriptomic signatures with neurological disorders, by exposing
mouse cortical neuron-enriched cultures to hundreds of chemicals commonly found in the
environment and on food. We find that rotenone, a pesticide associated with Parkinson’s
disease risk, and certain fungicides, including pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin, famoxadone and
fenamidone, produce transcriptional changes in vitro that are similar to those seen in brain
samples from humans with autism, advanced age and neurodegeneration (Alzheimer’s
disease and Huntington’s disease). These chemicals stimulate free radical production
and disrupt microtubules in neurons, effects that can be reduced by pretreating with a
microtubule stabilizer, an antioxidant, or with sulforaphane. Our study provides an approach
to prospectively identify environmental chemicals that transcriptionally mimic autism and
other brain disorders.

 P
owerful new sequencing technologies have been used to
systematically identify hundreds of candidate gene muta-
tions associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
risk1,2. Heritability studies suggest that environmental factors
also contribute to autism risk3. Indeed, gestational exposure to
pesticides, including maternal proximity to pesticide applications
and runoff, is reproducibly associated with increased ASD risk in
epidemiological studies4–6. However, epidemiological studies are
retrospective and cannot ascertain prospectively, precisely or
systematically which chemicals, of the 480,000 chemicals
registered for use in the environment, have the greatest
potential to harm the developing or adult brain7. Existing
in vivo neurodevelopmental and neurotoxicological assays with
animal models are labour intensive and costly, thus hindering
throughput,
whereas
higher-throughput
toxicological
assays
frequently use non-neuronal cells or focus on neuron death as
an end point8,9. As a result, these tests fail to interrogate
molecular and physiological processes that are unique to neurons
or that differentiate normal from diseased human brains.
There is growing recognition that brain transcriptional changes
are associated with ASD10,11. This ASD transcriptional signature
is defined by reduced expression of genes involved in synaptic
transmission and elevated expression of genes involved in
immune and microglial function10,11. Here we hypothesized
that this transcriptional signature might guide the prospective
identification of candidate chemical risks for ASD. To test this
hypothesis, we exposed mouse cortical neuron-enriched cultures
to hundreds of environmental-use chemicals and then monitored
global transcriptional changes. We identify six chemical groups,
one of which mimics the transcriptional changes seen in ASD, but
surprisingly also shares transcriptional similarity to the aged
brain and certain neurodegenerative conditions. Our findings
suggest
these
neurological
conditions
share
a
molecular
pathology, as hypothesized by others12, despite different ages of
onset and distinct behavioural symptoms. Moreover, our study
shows
that
a
transcriptional
approach
can
be
used
to
systematically scan a diverse chemical space and identify
potential environmental threats to the human brain.
Results
Mouse cortical cultures transcriptionally model human brain.
To determine whether mouse cortical cultures model cellular and
molecular aspects of the human brain, we performed immuno-
cytochemistry with cellular markers and compared the gene
expression profile of our cultures with brain cell-type-specific
expression data sets and human brain gene expression data sets,
including the Allen BrainSpan atlas (www.brainspan.org) and
GTEx13,14. Our cultures contained many of the principle cell
types of the brain based on immunocytochemistry with markers
for neurons, astrocytes and microglia (B25% of cultures were
non-neuronal cells; Fig. 1a,b). In addition, the expression of
markers for each brain cell type13 in our cultures was highly
correlated with that of whole embryonic (E14.5) brain (Pearson
r ¼ 0.8), further suggesting that our culture system represented all
major cell classes in biologically realistic proportions (Fig. 1c;
Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). Globally, gene expression in our
cortical cultures correlated more strongly with each human
brain region (except spinal cord) than to any other tissues of the
human body (Supplementary Fig. 2a). The strongest correlations
were to frontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, regions
implicated in ASD3. Moreover, cultures were most strongly
correlated with frontal cortex from mid-late gestation human
brain (Supplementary Fig. 2b), the developmental time window
implicated
in
ASD
pathogenesis15.
In
contrast,
terminally
differentiated neurons derived from human embryonic stem
cells16 did not strongly correlate with any brain region, and
instead were most similar to tissues associated with the female
reproductive system (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Taken together, our
cortical cultures show strong transcriptional similarities to the
human brain.
Transcriptional screen with environmental chemicals. We
next measured cytotoxicity of the 294 chemicals in the US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ToxCast Phase I library,
which
includes
common
food-use
pesticides
and
other
environmental chemicals, such as plasticizers8, to identify a
non-toxic concentration for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We
treated cultures in quadruplicate for 24 h at 10 mM, as this is a
common concentration used in screening studies17, then used
fluorescent markers to quantify the proportion of live and dead
cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). Most (87%) of the chemicals were
not cytotoxic at 10 mM, whereas concentrations of the remaining
chemicals had to be reduced to between 10 and 100 nM
(Supplementary Data 1). Fresh cultures were then treated (24 h)
with each chemical at the non-toxic concentration or with vehicle
(equivalent dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) concentration r0.5%),
as the negative control. We also tested three topoisomerase 1
(TOP1) inhibitors, as they reproducibly downregulate long
(4100 kb) genes18.
To identify chemicals that caused concordant gene expression
changes, we performed hierarchical clustering of 5,121 genes
variably expressed across all chemicals, and six chemical groups
emerged (hereafter referred to as clusters 1–6; Fig. 2; see Methods
and Supplementary Fig. 4 for batch correction details). Individual
chemicals were assigned to a cluster using a pairwise correlation
threshold and were validated to be statistically and biologically

 significant (Supplementary Fig. 5; see Methods for further details
on inclusion/exclusion criteria). To evaluate whether existing
in vitro ToxCast assay data could identify similar chemical
relationships, we performed clustering analysis across 199
cell-free and cellular (non-neuronal) assays. The resulting
chemical groupings did not resemble those we detected by gene
expression profiling (Supplementary Fig. 6). Thus, transcriptional
profiling with neuronal cells identifies relationships between
chemicals that existing toxicological assays failed to detect.
To determine what these functional relationships were, we
examined specific genes with altered expression in each cluster
(Fig. 2). Cluster 1 chemicals upregulated immediate early genes
(IEGs) while reducing expression of several potassium channel
genes. These expression changes were suggestive of neuronal
hyperexcitability. Supporting this possibility, cluster 1 included
two pyrethroids (cyfluthrin and fenpropathrin) that stimulate
sustained
calcium
influx
in
cortical
neurons19.
Cluster
2
chemicals
upregulated
numerous
immune
and
cytoskeletal
transcripts but reduced expression of ion channel and synaptic
genes. Cluster 3 chemicals upregulated IEGs but reduced the
expression of immune and cytoskeletal genes. Cluster 4 chemicals
resembled cluster 3, but without inducing IEGs. Cluster 5
contained
all
three
TOP1
inhibitors,
which
markedly
downregulated long genes and downregulated IEGs, consistent
with one of these inhibitors (topotecan) reducing spontaneous
synaptic
activity
in
cortical
neuron
cultures20.
Deletion
of a related topoisomerase (TOP2B) reduced IEG expression21.
Cluster 6 chemicals reduced expression of several neuro-
transmitter receptor subunits, including N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptor subunits (Grin2a and Grin2b), cholinergic receptors
(Chrm2 and Chrna7) and ion channels.
Cluster 2 transcriptionally mimics specific brain disorders. We
next identified the molecular pathways that were differentially
associated with the six chemical clusters using gene set analysis
(GSA). Included in this analysis were 64 gene sets for human
brain disorders and nervous system pathways that we generated
from publications (Supplementary Data 2) alongside 4,722
curated pathways. Over 600 gene sets distinguished the six
clusters (Supplementary Fig. 7; Supplementary Data 3), including
many of the human brain disorder gene sets (Fig. 3). However,
only cluster 2 chemicals mimicked the transcriptional changes of
two post-mortem ASD brain expression data sets in a bidirec-
tional manner. This included downregulation of M12 and Mod1
(largely composed of synaptic genes that are downregulated in
ASD brains), and upregulation of M16 and Mod5 (largely com-
posed of microglial/immune genes that are upregulated in ASD
brains)10,11. In addition, cluster 2 showed concordance with aging
human brain and two neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer’s
disease and Huntington’s disease), suggesting shared aspects of
molecular pathology despite different symptoms (see Discussion).
Fenamidone, pyraclostrobin and two other chemicals in cluster
2 (famoxadone and trifloxystrobin) are members of a recently
developed class of fungicides that inhibit mitochondrial complex
III by targeting the quinone outside (Qo) site of cytochrome bc1
(ref. 22). Since fenamidone and pyraclostrobin are structurally
distinct (Fig. 4a,b), we performed RNA-seq with multiple
replicates of both the chemicals to further validate that expression
of a common set of genes was altered. Each fungicide altered
expression of a largely overlapping set of genes (Fig. 4c,d;
Supplementary Data 4). Upregulated transcripts included Nrf2
target antioxidant response genes and Rest, which we validated
using
quantitative
real-time
PCR
(qRT–PCR)

 Rest elevation is associated with human brain aging and
neurodegeneration23. Other compounds in cluster 2 include
fenpyroximate, pyridaben and rotenone, chemicals that target
mitochondrial complex I (ref. 24). Exposure to rotenone is
known to increase risk for Parkinson’s disease24,25. All cluster 2
chemicals reduced RNA-seq reads arising from the mitochondrial
genome
(Fig.
2),
suggesting
compromised
mitochondrial
function as a common mechanism26. Note that none of the
mitochondrially encoded transcripts were among the 5,121
variably expressed genes assayed by hierarchical clustering, so
these transcripts did not influence cluster assignment. However,
the influence of chemical treatment on mitochondrial density or
viability was not assessed and could have indirectly modulated
transcriptional profiles.

 and with neurodegeneration30,31. Given that cytoskeletal genes
were altered by cluster 2 chemicals and that rotenone (also in
cluster 2) destabilizes microtubules31,32, we hypothesized that
microtubule depolymerization triggered the aberrant swelling

of
neurons.

(Supplementary Fig. 10a). Last, superoxide production and

Assessment of potential confounds. Cluster 2 compounds
upregulated numerous microglial- (for example, Cx3cr1 and
Trem2) and astrocyte- (for example, Gfap and Aqp4) enriched
genes33. This increase in markers of proliferating brain cell types
was unlikely to be due to cell division, as our cultures were treated
with an antimitotic on days in vitro (DIV) 3. Moreover,
fenamidone (under the same conditions used for sequencing)
caused no significant change in cellular composition, based on
immunocytochemical quantification of neurons, astrocytes and
microglia with markers (NeuN, Gfap and Iba1, respectively;
Supplementary
Fig.
11a).
However,
any
contribution
by
additional non-neuronal cell types such as oligodendrocytes has
not been accounted for. Neither culture batch nor sequencing
batch effects contributed to cluster identity (Supplementary
Fig. 4). We also assessed RNA quality using the RNA integrity
number (RIN) as a proxy. There were subtle differences in quality
among the six clusters, and RINs were significantly lower for
clusters 2 and 6 (Supplementary Fig. 11b). However, the average
RINs were Z9.25 for each of the six clusters, indicating that these
samples were of sufficiently high quality. Collectively, we found
no evidence that technical artefacts or poor RNA quality
contributed to cluster identity. However, we cannot exclude the
possibility that some of the chemicals alter cellular composition at
higher concentrations or after longer exposure times.
Increasing agricultural use of several cluster 2 chemicals.
Epidemiological and human exposure data for most chemicals in
cluster 2 are lacking. We thus sought to evaluate exposure
potential by analysing chemical usage and food commodity
residue data collected by the United States Geological Survey,
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA). All of the mitochondrial
complex III inhibitors in cluster 2 showed positive environmental
usage trends since their EPA registration in 2000 or later
(Fig. 7). Usage of complex I inhibitors (rotenone and pyridaben)
is low and unchanging, with the notable exception of fenpy-
roximate, the most potent superoxide producer we identified
(concentration for half-maximum response (EC50) ¼ 0.007 mM;
Supplementary Fig. 8b). Many cluster 2 residues were found on
conventionally raised food commodities, particularly leafy green
vegetables, and were detected at relatively high levels, up to
20 p.p.m. in the case of pyraclostrobin. These data suggest
significant human exposure potential to many of the chemicals in
cluster 2.
Discussion
By comparing gene expression profiles of cortical cell cultures
with expression data from human brain disorders, we identified a
group of eight chemicals (cluster 2) that transcriptionally
mimicked ASD, brain aging and neurodegeneration. These
chemicals, most of which inhibit mitochondrial complex I
or III, stimulated free radical production and disrupted micro-
tubules. We found that pretreating with a microtubule stabilizer,
an antioxidant, or with sulforaphane could reduce these effects.

 Whether this transcriptional and cellular response is related to
the marked clinical efficacy of sulforaphane at treating ASD
symptoms27 remains to be determined.
Numerous studies investigated a link between the inhibition of
mitochondrial complex I, neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration in
animal models24,34,35. Rotenone (in cluster 2) has been shown
to increase Parkinson’s disease risk in humans25. Cluster 2
also included a relatively new class of fungicides (quinone
outside, Qo) that inhibit mitochondrial complex III. No evidence
of
neurotoxicity
was
noted
for
two
of
these
fungicides,
pyraclostrobin and fenamidone, in a set of assays used by
regulatory
agencies36,37.
However,
a
single
oral
dose
of
trifloxystrobin (also in cluster 2) reduced motor activity for
several hours in female rats and for 3 days in males38, suggesting
a strong interaction with sex. Picoxystrobin (not in ToxCast
Phase I library), marketed as the most rapidly absorbed and most
systemic
(in
plants)
of
all
Qo
fungicides,
caused
acute
neurotoxicity (reduced motor activity) at the lowest dose tested
in rats39. Further, mitochondrial complex III-deficient mice
showed severe superoxide-dependent damage to cortical brain
regions and profound motor deficits that were apparent at night,
during their active phase40. Note that standard acute and chronic
neurotoxicity assays are performed during the day, when rodents
are less active, possibly reducing the power to detect motor
deficits. Mitochondrial complex III inhibitors can additionally
block
neuronal
differentiation
by
maintaining
embryonic
stem cell pluripotency41, suggesting a potential for neuro-
developmental effects.
Usage data indicate that Qo fungicides are increasingly
prevalent on food that is consumed by humans of all ages.
At least one cluster 2 chemical (pyraclostrobin) is present in
the environment at levels that affect non-mammalian organ-
isms42,43 and was detected at high levels on foraging honeybees,
further corroborating high levels in the environment42. To
address whether these levels are a risk to human health, recent
in vitro reverse dosimetry extrapolations from the EPA found that
food levels of pyraclostrobin exceed the human oral equivalent
dose necessary to affect mitochondrial processes44. However, Qo
fungicide residues have not been detected on organically
produced foods (EPA and USDA data), suggesting a way to
minimize exposure.
Our finding that cluster 2 chemicals mimic the transcriptional
changes of autism, as well as the aging brain and neurodegenera-
tion was surprising, particularly given the different ages of onset
and disease symptoms. Oxidative stress and cytoskeletal integrity
are implicated in all of these conditions45–49, suggesting that
overlapping pathological processes might drive the transcriptional
similarities we observed. In support of shared biology, we found

 that ASD, the aging brain, Alzheimer’s disease and Huntington’s
disease exhibit altered expression of a common set of genes more
so than any of the other neurological gene sets we tested
(Supplementary
Fig.
12a). Many
of
the genes
that
were
differentially regulated by pyraclostrobin were also found in the
M16 and M12 ASD gene modules (Supplementary Fig. 12b–e).
Moreover, when focusing specifically on the genes in these ASD
modules, the direction and magnitude by which these genes were
dysregulated in ASD patient samples was strongly correlated with
that
of
pyraclostrobin
treatment
in
our
cortical
cultures
(Spearman r ¼ 0.66; Supplementary Fig. 12f), further suggesting
a
common
mechanism.
The
fact
that
these
neurological
conditions
shared
a
core
set
of
dysregulated
genes
may
contribute to the enrichment observed for cluster 2 across these
diseases. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that
molecular pathologies are shared by some but not all of the
conditions. Disentangling these relationships is beyond the scope
of our current study, but suggests a fruitful area for future
research.
Several of the chemicals in cluster 2 unquestionably kill
neurons at higher concentrations (Supplementary Data 1),
consistent with other studies9,50. This raises the question of
whether cluster 2 reflects the transcriptional signature of ‘sick’
neurons. We identified several chemicals that killed cells at
multiple concentrations (Supplementary Data 1), yet only those
that
were
associated
with
O2
�
production,
microtubule
destabilization and elevated expression of neuroinflammatory
genes were assigned to cluster 2. It thus seems unlikely that
cluster 2 is reflective of chemicals that nonspecifically kill neurons
at high doses and sicken neurons at lower doses. In fact,
chemicals can kill (and presumably sicken) cells via distinct
mechanisms32, with one of these mechanisms being ‘microtubule
destabilization.’ Rotenone and vincristine fit within this class32,
likely
providing
additional
insights
into
why
paclitaxel
(a microtubule stabilizer) attenuated the soma swelling and O2
�
production phenotypes induced by a cluster 2 chemical (Fig. 5).
Our study also shows how systematic transcriptional studies
with neurons can uncover new brain- and disease-relevant
relationships between chemicals that cannot be identified using
existing toxicology assays (Supplementary Fig. 6), including those
that rely on cell death as a readout.
We identified additional brain-relevant relationships between
chemicals within other clusters. Cluster 1 appears to define a
transcriptional signature of neuron hyperexcitability, as evidenced
by upregulation of IEGs, a class of genes that mark recently
depolarized neurons, and downregulation of potassium channels
(which increases neuron excitability when downregulated51).
Cluster 1 contained two pyrethroids that hyperexcite mammalian
neurons19. Intriguingly, two recent epidemiological studies found
that pyrethroid exposure doubles the risk for attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder in boys52,53. Our transcriptional approach
might provide a way to prospectively identify candidate chemical
risks for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Cluster 5
contained all three topoisomerase inhibitors, a class of drugs
that downregulated long genes in neurons18, reduced synaptic
activity20 and reduced IEG expression (Fig. 2). Moreover, cluster
5 is strongly correlated with neurological disease models that
feature dysregulated long synaptic gene expression, particularly
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis54 and Rett syndrome55,56.
Though estimates vary, B50% of cells in the adult human
central nervous system are neurons57. This is in contrast to the
embryonic culture system employed here, which is comprised of
over 70% neurons. This disparity has the potential to bias
physiological signatures and impair the ability to detect some
disease-relevant processes. Although our cultures show a very
similar representation of brain cell markers relative to E14.5
whole mouse brain (Supplementary Fig. 1), suggesting our
cortical cultures—dissected at E14.5—contain the major brain
cell classes in biologically realistic proportions. Moreover, the
model system employed here is amenable to high-throughput
screens and functional assays17. Ultimately, candidate chemicals
identified with a cortical culture system will require validation in
animal models.
In summary, our study shows that chemicals that transcrip-
tionally mimic brain disorders can be identified by profiling gene
expression in cortical cultures. This approach may also prove
useful in identifying candidate ASD therapeutics, such as
sulforaphane, or in identifying drugs that normalize long gene
expression, such as topoisomerase inhibitors in Rett syndrome
model neurons55. While usage and residue levels of cluster 2
chemicals on conventionally grown foods are increasing, in the
absence of causality, it is premature to draw correlations with
the increased prevalence of ASD and other brain disorders.
Nonetheless, greater scrutiny over whether these new Qo
fungicides affect the developing or adult mammalian nervous
system (enteric, peripheral and central) or behaviours seems
warranted, particularly given their striking mechanistic similarity
to rotenone. Ultimately, monitoring steady-state levels in the
environment, assessing exposure levels and pharmacokinetics,
and epidemiological studies will be needed to evaluate whether
any of these chemicals pose real neurological threats to humans
or increase risk for brain disorders, including ASD.
Methods
Cortical neuron culture. Primary mouse cortical neuron cultures were prepared as
previously described from E14.5 pregnant C57BL/6J (Cat. #000664, Jackson) dams
crossed to CAST/EiJ (Cat. #000928, Jackson) males18. Hybrid cultures are thought
to better model genetic variation associated with human populations58. Dissociated
cells were placed in multiwell plates coated with poly-D-lysine (0.1 mg ml � 1) in
Neurobasal medium (Life Technologies) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco),
B27 (17504-044, Invitrogen), Antibiotic-Antimycotic (15240-062, Invitrogen) and
GlutaMAX (35050-061, Invitrogen). At DIV 3, a half medium change was
performed with feeding medium identical to the plating medium except that we
omitted fetal bovine serum and included 4.84 mg ml � 1 uridine 50-triphosphate
(U6625, Sigma-Aldrich) and 2.46 mg ml � 1 5-fluoro-20-deoxyuridine (F0503,
Sigma-Aldrich) to inhibit mitosis in dividing cells.
Chemicals. The chemical library was donated by the EPA ToxCast Program. For
verification and replication experiments, the following chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich: DL-a tocopherol acetate (T3376), DL-sulforophane (S4441),
vincristine sulfate salt (V8879), oxyfluorfen (35031), rotenone (45656), fenamidone
(33965), pyraclostrobin (33696), trifloxystrobin (46447), myxothiazol (T5580),
pyridaben (46047), azoxystrobin (31697), fluoxastrobin (33797), fenpyroximate
(31684) and kresoxim-methyl (37899). Famoxadone was purchased from Chem
Service, Inc (N-11943). Topotecan hydrochloride was purchased from Tocris
(4562). Paclitaxel was purchased from Fisher Scientific (AC32842). All chemical
stocks were prepared in DMSO unless otherwise noted. Vehicle samples were
prepared with an equivalent DMSO concentration of r0.5% in feeding medium.
Live/dead assay. Cultures were grown on poly-D-lysine coated 96-well plates
at a density of 5 � 104 cells per well. Culture plates were screened for quality by
qualitative assessment of density and by confirming low percentage (o10%) of
dead cells in control wells as established by the method described below. Chemicals
were applied in quadruplicate by performing a half medium change with a 2 �
concentration in prewarmed feeding medium on culture plates meeting these
quality criteria, at DIV 7. After 24 h, another half medium change was performed
with medium containing NucBlue (R37605, Life Technologies) and SYTOX Green
(S7020, Life Technologies) dyes according to the manufacturer’s directions. Cells
were then rinsed twice with PBS (137 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM
KH2PO4) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for
10 min at room temperature. After rinsing an additional two times with PBS, the
cells were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ti epifluorescent microscope at �10
magnification with ultraviolet excitation to reveal the NucBlue dye marking all
cells, and with fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set to identify dead SYTOX-positive
cells. Channel-merged colour images were imported into ImageJ software (NIH)
and converted into RGB stacks. A manual threshold was performed on the
NucBlue channel to yield an image amenable to binary particle analysis. The
threshold set for the NucBlue channel was utilized for the SYTOX channel to
reduce any potential bias. Particle analysis was performed on each channel for each

 image to obtain the total number of nuclei and the total number of nuclei from
dead cells, respectively. The percentage of dead cells was calculated and averaged
across four replicates. All chemicals from the library were initially tested at 10 mM.
A concentration causing 10% or greater cell death relative to vehicle was considered
toxic. Lower doses were tested by reducing an order of magnitude until a non-toxic
dose was identified.
RNA-seq. Cultures were treated with the non-cytotoxic dose of each chemical, by
exchanging half of the original medium with chemicals at 2 � concentration in
prewarmed feeding medium, on DIV 7 for 24 h in 12-well plates at a density of
5 � 105 cells per well. RNA was isolated using RNeasy plus mini kit (Cat. #74134,
Qiagen). RNA yield and quality were determined using a Nanodrop 1000
Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Samples were further assessed for quality
using either an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 or TapeStation 2200 to obtain a RIN.
RIN values exceeding 7 were used for sequencing. RNA samples were used to
generate and barcode complementary DNA libraries using the TruSeq RNA
Library Preparation Kit at the UNC High Throughput Sequencing Facility. Pools of
24 multiplexed samples were sequenced per lane on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 using
50-bp paired-end reads.
RNA-seq data processing. RNA-seq reads were filtered using TagDust and
aligned to the reference mouse genome (mm9) with TopHat using default
parameters59,60. Reads aligning to ribosomal RNA genes were removed. Transcript
abundance was estimated by computing Reads per kilobase per million mapped
reads (RPKM) using RefSeq gene models aggregated by gene symbol61. For
differential expression analyses, raw counts over RefSeq exons were used, and then
were compared across samples using DESeq62.
Hierarchical clustering and cluster membership. RPKMs for all RefSeq genes
and all samples were filtered such that a given gene had 490% of samples with
RPKM 40 and gene length exceeded 500 bp. RPKMs were then log10-transformed,
quantile-normalized, median-centred, and the effects due to culture or sequencing
batch were removed using a mixed model analysis of variance. This batch
correction step was performed on individual experiments rather than chemical–
vehicle ratios to reduce the effects due to variations in culture composition as well
as batch-to-batch variations at the level of sequencing. Genes were then median-
centred again, and filtered such that their s.d. exceeded 0.1. Chemical replicates
were then combined using the median. Classes of chemicals were then discovered
in two ways. First, we performed hierarchical clustering using average linkage and
Pearson correlation distance measures. The boundaries of the discovered classes
from clustering were set by computing pairwise Spearman correlations for all
samples. A given cluster had to have at least three members with the minimum
pairwise Spearman correlation coefficient exceeding 0.2, though cluster members
often exceeded a correlation of 0.6 (Supplementary Fig. 5c,d). Seven chemical
clusters were discovered, however one was removed due to failing to have a positive
silhouette width, a metric of cluster robustness63. These definitions enabled the
three positive control topoisomerase inhibitors to form a cohesive group of
chemicals with known structural and functional similarity (cluster 5). None of the
culture or sequencing batches contributed to the formation of any one of the
final six clusters (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Hierarchical clustering of EPA toxicological assays. Concentration at 50%
maximum activity (AC50) values for all assays and all ToxCast Phase I chemicals
were retrieved from the EPA Dashboard. We retained only those assays with data
available for 99% of the chemicals and required that a given assay must have at
least five active chemicals (AC50r10 mM); 199 assays were retained. We then
transformed the data values as described in Sipes et al.64 and performed
hierarchical clustering to find the chemical groups with concordant activity on
certain assays.
Pathway analysis. To detect differentially regulated pathways, chemicals within
each of the six clusters were separately compared with all other chemicals tested
using GSA65, supplying a modified gene pathway file that contained all MSigDB C2
annotations as well as gene sets from published gene expression studies in human
diseases and mouse models. Nearly all added gene sets were derived directly from
the associated publication. Raw data derived from Durrenberger et al.66 were
analysed by applying quantile normalization, and differential expression was
detected using SAM using 500 permutations67. Some brain disease gene expression
studies had no significantly differentially expressed genes (qo0.05), and hence
could not be included in our analysis. For ‘BLALOCK_ALZHEIMERS_UP’, a gene
set included within MSigDB C2, we removed gene symbols that were not included
in the RefSeq annotation. The Mod1 pathway (Gupta et al.10) was filtered to
include genes with a KM1 score of 0.4 or greater, to reduce the number of genes in
this pathway below 1,500 so it could be analysed by GSA. A given pathway (size
between 10 and 1,500 genes) was considered if it achieved statistical significance
(false discovery rateo0.1) for at least one cluster compared with all other chemicals
(500 permutations). Expression of a single pathway was then summarized by taking
the median expression value across all genes in that pathway for a given chemical.
Once the entire data matrix was assembled, pathways were median-centred and
hierarchically clustered, while keeping chemical ordering consistent with Fig. 2.
Disease-relevant ontologies were then extracted and plotted separately; colour was
applied based on the pathway enrichment score (blue indicates pathway
downregulation and red indicates pathway upregulation), but only for the
pathways achieving statistical significance (false discovery rateo0.1).
Quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted and purified using the
RNeasy plus mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was
quantified using Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific) and reverse transcribed using
iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix (Bio-Rad). Quantitative real-time PCR
analysis was performed in technical duplicates using SYBR Green PCR master mix
(Applied Biosystems) in a 7500 Real-Time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems).
An amount of 10 ng of complementary DNA was used in each reaction. Fold
change of expression of the target RNA in each treatment condition relative to the
untreated sample were calculated by raising 2 to the power of � DDCt. DDCt was
calculated by subtracting the DCt of the untreated sample to the DCt of each
treatment condition. The DCt of each sample was calculated by subtracting the
average Ct of Gapdh to the average Ct of the target RNA. The following primers
were used at a final concentration of 0.5 mM:
Rest (F: 50-GTGCGAACTCACACAGGAGA-30, R: 50-AAGAGGTTTAGGCC
CGTTGT-30); Gsta4 (F: 50-CGGCTGGAGTGGAGTTTGAG-30, R: 50-CCAAGG
GTACTTGGCCGAAA-30); Gstm1 (F: 50-CCGTGCAGACATTGTGGAGA-30,
R: 50-CTGCTTCTCAAAGTCAGGGTTG-30); Hmox1 (F: 50-AGGCTTTAAGCT
GGTGATGGC-30, R: 50-GGGGCATAGACTGGGTTCTG-30); and Gapdh
(F: 50-TATGACTCCACTCACGGCAAAT-30, R: 50-GGGTCTCGCTCCTGGAA
GAT-30).
Fluorescence Immunohistochemistry. Mouse cortical neuron cultures were
prepared identically as for live/dead and RNA-Seq experiments but at an equivalent
density of 2.5 � 105 cells per well in a 24-well plate containing precoated glass
coverslips. At DIV 7, cells were treated with fenamidone at a concentration of
10 mM for 24 h. Coverslip-adherent cells were rinsed, paraformaldehyde fixed,
blocked with 10% donkey serum and probed with the following cell-type-specific
primary antibodies: guinea pig anti-NeuN (1:400, ABN90P, Millipore), goat
anti-Gfap (1:1,200, ab53554, Abcam) and rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:400, 019-19741,
Wako Pure Chemical Industries). Species-specific AlexaFluor-conjugated donkey
secondary antibodies (1:200, Life Technologies) were then applied along with
Nucblue (Life Technologies) to counterstain all nuclei. Coverslips were inverted
into mounting substance (Fluorogel, 17985-10, Electron Microscopy Sciences) and
imaged on a Zeiss LSM 710 laser scanning confocal microscope using a � 10
objective tiling scan of entire coverslips including three z planes to account for
uneven coverslips. A researcher blind to the experimental conditions of images
utilized maximal projected, spliced images to obtain particle counts for the total
Nucblue-positive nuclei and the NeuN-positive neurons using particle analysis in
ImageJ. Gfap- and Iba1-positive features containing clear Nucblue-positive nuclei
were manually counted using the count function in Adobe Photoshop.
Mitochondrial superoxide detection and live-cell imaging. Cultures were pre-
pared on commercial poly-D-lysine-coated glass coverslips (GG-12-pdl, neuVitro)
in 24-well plates at a density of 1.5 � 105 cells per well. At DIV 7, cells were treated
with chemical or an equivalent DMSO concentration in feeding medium for 2 h.
Cells were then treated with MitoSOX Red (M36008, Life Technologies) mito-
chondrial superoxide indicator for 10 min at 37 �C. Medium containing the dye
was aspirated, and the cells rinsed twice with 37 �C feeding medium and replaced
with 37 �C artificial cerebral spinal fluid composed of 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl,
1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES and 10 mM dextrose (pH 7.3).
Individual coverslips were transferred to a stage-top perfusion system mounted on
an inverted Nikon Ti Eclipse microscope with constant flow of warmed artificial
cerebral spinal fluid. Images ( � 20) were collected using an Andora Clara
charge-coupled device camera for brightfield and the Texas Red channel to
ascertain the mitochondrial superoxide levels with the same exposure across all
experiments. ImageJ software (NIH) was used to trace the soma of the cells in
bright-field images as regions of interest (ROIs) using the polygon selection tool.
ROIs were then superimposed on the fluorescent image and the total cell fluor-
escence was calculated per ROI to account for the size of the ROI and normalize to
background fluorescent levels, as described68. Fluorescence intensity was then
normalized to average corrected vehicle intensity. At least two non-overlapping
fields from each coverslip were collected for each well. ROI tracing was performed
by a researcher blind to the experimental condition. For select conditions, the
proportion of cells showing altered soma morphology was manually calculated per
image by the same experimenter performing ROI tracing.
Tubulin polymerization assay. Chemicals were tested in a commercially available
cell-free biochemical assay (BK011P, Cytoskeleton, Inc). Briefly, control and
experimental solutions were prepared and loaded in duplicate into a warm (37 �C)
96-well plate. A solution of purified tubulin and a fluorescent reporter were added
to the wells containing the warm substances and placed into a prewarmed (37 �C)
Biotek Synergy HT microplate reader where fluorescence was measured every

 minute for 60 min. Equimolar doses of paclitaxel (included in kit) and vincristine
(V8879, Sigma-Aldrich) were included as positive and negative modulators of
tubulin polymerization, respectively.
Chemical usage and approval data. Usage data were acquired from United States
Geological Survey. Data are reported as total kilograms applied for each chemical
across all US counties sampled per year (2000–2012) and a linear trend line
was fit beginning in year 2000 or with the registration year (if after 2000).
Registration dates for specific pesticide products were obtained from the National
Pesticide Information Retrieval System (NPIRS; http://ppis.ceris.purdue.edu/).
The NPIRS is a collection of pesticide-related databases, applications and websites
under the administration of the Center for Environmental and Regulatory
Information Systems at Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana. NPIRS
obtains product information on a weekly basis from the EPA Pesticide Product
Information System website. This Pesticide Product Information System
information, including registered use sites and pests listed on the EPA stamped
approved label, is disseminated through the NPIRS member and public websites,
and is provided for informational purposes only. To ascertain which foodstuffs had
the greatest amount of these chemicals, we ranked the five food commodities in
descending order of maximum residue level detected using 2008–2012 data from
the USDA Pesticide Data Program and the FDA Pesticide Program Residue
Monitoring Program.
