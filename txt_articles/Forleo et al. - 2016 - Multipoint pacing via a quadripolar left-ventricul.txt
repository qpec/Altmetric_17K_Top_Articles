Aims
This registry was created to describe the experience of 76 Italian centres with a large cohort of recipients of multipoint
pacing (MPP) capable cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices.
Methods
and results
A total of 507 patients in whom these devices had been successfully implanted were enrolled between August 2013 and
May 2015. We analysed: (i) current clinical practices for the management of such patients, and (ii) the impact of MPP on
heart failure clinical composite response and on the absolute change in ejection fraction (EF) at 6 months. Multipoint
pacing was programmed to ‘ON’ in 46% of patients before discharge. Methods of optimizing MPP programming were
most commonly based on either the greatest narrowing of the QRS complex (38%) or the electrical delays between the
electrodes (34%). Clinical and echocardiographic follow-up data were evaluated in 232 patients. These patients were
divided into two groups according to whether MPP was programmed to ‘ON’ (n ¼ 94) or ‘OFF’ (n ¼ 138) at the time of
discharge. At 6 months, EF was significantly higher in the MPP group than in the biventricular-pacing group (39.1+ 9.6
vs. 34.7 + 7.6%; P , 0.001). Even after adjustments, early MPP activation remained an independent predictor of
absolute increase in LVEF of ≥5% (odds ratio 2.5; P ¼ 0.001). At 6 months, an improvement in clinical composite score
was recorded in a greater proportion of patients with MPP-ON than in controls (56 vs. 38%; P ¼ 0.009). On comparing
optimal MPP and conventional vectors, QRS was also seen to have decreased significantly (P , 0.001).
Conclusion
This study provides information that is essential in order to deal with the expected increase in the number of patients
receiving MPP devices in the coming years. The results revealed different practices among centres, and establishing the
optimal programming that can maximize the benefit of MPP remains a challenging issue. Compared with conventional
CRT, MPP improved clinical status and resulted in an additional increase in EF.

Pacing and resynchronization therapy

 Introduction
Over the last decade, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has
evolved considerably, becoming established as a treatment option in
selected patients with heart failure (HF).1 –4 However, the clinical
response to CRT remains highly variable and a significant propor-
tion of patients fail to respond positively (�30% with current
technology). Recent studies suggest that multipoint left-ventricular
(LV) pacing [MultiPointTM Pacing (MPP), St JudeMedical, Sylmar, CA]
via a LV quadripolar pacing lead5–8 may be an alternative approach
that can improve CRT response by simultaneously recruiting a
larger volume of myocardium.9–13 However, almost all data in the
literature refer to the acute phase after implantation while clinical
follow-up data are limited to 44 patients enrolled in a single-centre
study.14,15 With the current focus on improved quality and effi-
ciency of healthcare delivery, additional data are of great importance
in order to establish whether this benefit is sustained over the
long-term.
This prospective, non-randomized, multi-centre, observational
study was undertaken with a two-fold aim: (i) to identify current
clinical practices in the management of CRT patients in whom
MPP-enabled CRT devices are implanted; (ii) to verify the feasibility
and the effects of CRT on the clinical status and echocardiographic
parameters of recipients of devices with this capability.
Methods
The IRON-MPP registry: patient population
and data collection
The IRON-MPP (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02606071) is a pro-
spective multicentre, observational registry designed to collect clinical
and device data from a large cohort of HF patients treated in clinical
practice with a CRT-D device endowed with the ability to deliver
MPP. From August 2013 to May 2015, consecutive patients were pro-
spectively enrolled at 76 Italian academic and private cardiology centres
homogeneously distributed throughout Italy (see Supplementary
material online, Appendix). Centres were asked to collect data before
hospital discharge from consecutive patients who had undergone
successful CRT-D implantation. Patients enrolled in any device study
affecting programming or treatment were excluded. Eligibility for device
implantation was based on international guidelines.16
Patients were included regardless of whether they were undergoing a
first-device implantation procedure or whether the LV lead was placed
as part of an upgrade procedure in patients who already had either a
permanent pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.
Baseline patient characteristics, procedural data, information on lead
positions, electrical measurement values, and optimization methods
used were requested in the survey questionnaire. Devices, LV vector
combinations, and pacing delays for MPP were individually programmed
as per the usual practice of each treating physician.
Enrolled patients gave written informed consent and data were col-
lected in accordance with institutional guidelines on ethics. Patient infor-
mation was de-identified and all data were entered in a web-based
database. The follow-up data presented in this paper were censored
at 6 months; however, patients are still being followed-up in the ongoing
registry.
Device characteristics and multipoint
left-ventricular pacing
Commercially available MPP-capable CRT-D devices (Unify Quadra MP
or Quadra Assura MP, St Jude Medical, Sylmar, CA) and leads were im-
planted in this study. Implantation was performed according to the
standard practice of the individual centre. Connected to a quadripolar
LV lead (QuartetTM LV lead, St Jude Medical, Sylmar, CA), these devices
have the ability to deliver sequential pacing pulses from 2 LV sites (MPP),
potentially capturing a larger area and engaging multiple zones in the
long axis of the LV.
Two LV pacing vectors (LV1 and LV2) can be selected from the 10
vectors available with the quadripolar systems: six with both cathodes
and anodes of the LV lead and the remaining four with an LV lead cath-
ode and the right-ventricular coil anode. Interventricular (LV–RV) and
intraventricular (LV–LV) delays are programmable in two different
ranges (5–80 ms for delay 1; 5–50 ms for delay 2). Device programming
and optimization were left to the discretion of the treating physician.
Follow-up
The variables captured at the 6-month follow-up examination included
survival, hospitalization, NYHA functional class, electrocardiographic
data, left-ventricular vector combinations and key echocardiographic
data. Standard case-report forms were used for data collection. The
timing of periodic follow-up examinations was left to the local
investigators.
Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed at the baseline
and at the 6-month follow-up examination, in order to assess changes
in EF. Only patients (n ¼ 232) in whom data were available both at
the baseline and at the 6-month follow-up examination were included
in the follow-up analysis. These 232 patients were divided into an ‘early
MPP activation’ group, with MPP programmed to ‘ON’ at the time of
post-implantation discharge (MPP-ON group), and a ‘non-MPP’ group,
in whom MPP remained ‘OFF’ or was switched ‘ON’ after hospital dis-
charge (MPP-OFF group). Left-ventricular EF was evaluated by means of
Simpson’s method and other conventional echocardiographic measure-
ments in strict conformity with echocardiography guidelines.
As part of the protocol of the study, the electrical performance of the
LV lead and the occurrence of phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) were
assessed during pacing from all 10 vectors. Programming adjustments,
timing of periodic follow-up examinations, and pharmacological therapy
were left to the local investigators.
Outcome measures
Response to CRT was evaluated through the HF clinical composite
score (CCS) and the relative change in LV ejection fraction at 6 months.
What’s new?
† Little is known about clinical outcomes and current clinical
practices for the management of patients in whom
MPP-endowed CRT devices are implanted. This is the first
registry to describe a multicentre experience with a large
cohort of recipients of MPP-capable CRT-D devices.
† The results revealed different practices among centres, and
establishing the optimal programming that can maximize
the benefit of MPP remains a challenging issue.
† After 6 months of MPP, clinical outcomes and LV function
were seen to have improved in comparison with those of
control subjects.

Multipoint LV pacing
 On the basis of the CCS, we classified patients into one of three
response groups: worsened, improved, or unchanged according to a
predefined scheme.17 Patients were classified as worsened if they died
or were hospitalized for worsening HF or had an increase in NYHA
functional class. Patients were classified as improved if they had not
worsened and had a decrease in NYHA functional class. Patients who
had neither worsened nor improved were classified as unchanged. An
increase in LVEF of 5% or more was used in this study as an objective
measure of cardiac structural improvement and response to CRT and
has been used in previous trials.18–22
Hospitalization for HF was defined as admission to a healthcare
facility for more than 24 h with symptoms of congestive HF and subse-
quent treatment for HF.
QRS analysis
Spontaneous and paced QRS duration were measured by means of rest-
ing 12-lead ECG and analysed by two independent investigators.
Bundle-branch block was defined on the basis of the World Health
Organization Task Force criteria.23 QRS duration was measured from
the first deflection until return to baseline in any lead of the 12-lead
surface ECG. The paced QRS duration was measured from the begin-
ning of the ventricular pacing spike to the end of the QRS complex as
the maximum paced QRS duration in any of the 12 ECG leads. In
each patient, we selected the minimum QRS duration during MPP vs.
conventional biventricular pacing.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables describing the patient population are expressed as
absolute numbers and percentages, while continuous variables are
shown as means [with standard deviations (SD)] or medians (with quar-
tiles) for continuous variables. Non-continuous variables expressed as
proportions were compared by means of x2 analysis with Yate correc-
tion or Fisher’s exact test. Normally distributed, continuous variables
were compared by means of the two-sample t-test for independent vari-
ables or paired t-test for paired data. Non-parametric Wilcoxon–
Mann–Whitney and Wilcoxon signed rank (for paired data) tests
were used for non-normally distributed variables.
Echocardiographic analysis was performed on the basis of the
intention-to-treat principle, and only patients with 6 months follow-up
data were included.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the inde-
pendent effect (Odds Ratio) of MPP activation on absolute increase in
EF at 6 months, with selected confounder parameters (significant asso-
ciation in univariate analysis) and with their potential interactions. All
P-values were two-sided, and a P-value of ,0.05 was considered to
indicate statistical significance.
The manuscript was written by the principal investigator (G.B.F.), and
the accuracy of the data reported was confirmed by all the authors who
had full access to the data.
Results
The IRON-MPP registry enrolled 507 patients in 76 centres over a
period of 22 months, when the database was frozen for interim
analysis. Baseline characteristics of the entire study population are
summarized in Table 1.
The contribution of each centre was variable and enrolment
ranged from 1 to 57 patients per centre (median 3, IQR 1.7–6).
The cohort was 79% male, and age ranged from 32 to 89 years.
The majority of left-ventricular leads were placed in a lateral
(51%) or posterolateral (27%) position, whereas the right-
ventricular lead was predominantly placed in the apex (52%).
Standards of care in multipoint
left-ventricular pacing
The LV capture thresholds (CT) were measured in at least 2 of the
10 available configurations in all patients. Considering a CT , 5 V
for at least two vectors without PNS at high pacing output, the
MPP function was programmable in 97% of patients. At a lower
CT cut-off (,3 V) for both vectors, MPP remained programmable
in 87% of patients (Table 2). Phrenic nerve stimulation was reported
in 93 patients in at least one configuration, but in only 17 patients
(4%) was MPP not programmable owing to PNS.
Before discharge from hospital, MPP was programmed to ‘OFF’ in
273 patients (54%) and remained inactive for the entire follow-up
except in two patients in whom the function was activated before
the follow-up examination (in all analyses these patients were con-
sidered to have been in the ‘MPP-OFF’ group for the complete
follow-up period). The mean LV capture threshold (at 0.5 ms) of
the two lower MPP vectors was 0.9 + 0.6 V and 1.5 + 1.0 V for

 LV1 and LV2, respectively. By the 6-month follow-up evaluation, in
39 out of 232 patients (17%) initially programmed to conventional
biventricular pacing, the MPP feature was switched to ‘ON’.
The choice and the timing of switching on MPP capabilities varied
widely among centres. In the early post-implantation phase, MPP
‘OFF’ was regarded as the best option by 30% of the centres; 58%
of the centres considered that MPP ‘ON’ should be preferred in the
early post-implantation period while in the remaining centres (12%)
both options were equally implemented.
In the MPP-ON group, information on acute MPP optimization
after implantation was available in 199 out of 233 patients and device
optimization was performed in 182 out of 199 patients (91%). In
38% of patients, MPP was programmed according to the configur-
ation that resulted in the greatest narrowing of the QRS complex.
In 34% the electrical delays between the electrodes were calculated
through the automatic device algorithm (CRT ToolkitTM St Jude
Medical, Sylmar, CA, USA) and the device was programmed accord-
ingly. In 3% of patients optimal delays and configurations were based
on echocardiographic evaluation, and few centres (10%) chose to
use a pressure guidewire for haemodynamic measurements. Figure 1
shows the distribution of the different methods of MPP optimization
prior to discharge. Additional data on final MPP pacing configura-
tions and interventricular delays are reported in Supplementary ma-
terial online, Appendix Tables A and B.
Influence of the pacing mode on QRS
duration
With regard to the best QRS shortening, we analysed the adjunctive
value of MPP compared with the best conventional biventricular
configuration. In the 108 patients in whom both MPP and conven-
tional biventricular configurations were evaluated, MPP significantly
reduced QRS duration in comparison with conventional biventricu-
lar pacing (134.8 +26 ms vs. 141.3 +25 ms; P , 0.001).
Six-month follow-up
At the 6-month follow-up examination, both clinical and echocar-
diographic data were available in 232 patients (46%); these patients
(median three patients per centre, IQR 2–8) are described in the
follow-up analysis of this manuscript. Of these 232 patients, 94
were enrolled in the MPP-ON group and 138 were enrolled in
the MPP-OFF group. The characteristics of patients without follow-
up data were similar to those of the remaining population.
Patients in the MPP-ON and MPP-OFF groups did not differ sig-
nificantly in terms of baseline clinical and echocardiographic para-
meters and aetiology of their cardiomyopathy (Table 3). However,
MPP was more likely to be activated in patients with wider QRS
at baseline.
During a median of 6 months’ follow-up, the MPP feature was
switched ‘ON’ in 17% of the patients in the ‘MPP-OFF’ group,
whereas nine patients in the MPP-ON group were reprogrammed
to ‘MPP-OFF’. At 6 months, the average percentage of ventricular
pacing was 96.7% in the MPP-OFF group and 96.4% in the MPP-ON
group (P ¼ 0.85).
Between study enrolment and the 6-month follow-up visit, LVEF
increased from 28.2% + 5.9 to 39.0% + 9.6% in the MPP-ON group
(P , 0.001 vs. baseline) and from 28.1% +6.0 to 34.7% + 7.6% in
the MPP-OFF group (P , 0.001 vs. baseline). At 6 months, the
MPP-ON group had a significantly higher mean left-ventricular EF
than the biventricular-pacing group (Figure 2), with an absolute dif-
ference of 4.2% between the groups in the change from baseline
(relative difference from baseline of 15% (Table 3).
Using logistic regression, univariate predictors of absolute in-
crease in LVEF of ≥5% at 6 months (Table 4) were analysed. Even
after adjustments, early MPP activation remained independent pre-
dictor of absolute increase in LVEF of ≥5% with odds ratio of 2.5
[(95% CI 1.3–4.9); P ¼ 0.001]. Significant factors included also left-
ventricular bundle block, baseline EF, and coronary artery disease
(Table 5).
A 6-month improvement in HF clinical composite score was ob-
served in 104 patients (45%). Twenty-eight patients (12%) were
judged to have worsened, and the remaining 100 were classified
as unchanged (43%). An improvement in clinical composite score
at 6 months was seen in a greater proportion of patients with
MPP-ON (56 vs. 38%; P ¼ 0.009) than in controls. In the MPP group,
9% of patients were worsened vs. 15% in the CRT group. The re-

Discussion
Early experiences strongly support the finding that MPP improves
acute haemodynamic response in comparison with conventional bi-
ventricular pacing.24 However, the clinical value of MPP has yet to be
tested in larger prospective studies. Furthermore, no information is
available on current practices for the management of patients who
receive MPP-capable devices. This prospective, multicentre clinical
experience is the first to provide a unique snapshot of the character-
istics and management of patients in whom MPP devices are im-
planted in cardiology practices across Italy. The main results of
this study can be summarized as follows: (i) MPP reduced the degree
of ventricular dyssynchrony (as evidenced by shortening of the QRS
interval), and this effect was accompanied by an increase in left-
ventricular ejection fraction; (ii) a QRS-based strategy was the
option adopted by most cardiologists to optimize MPP program-
ming, whereas few chose echocardiographic or haemodynamic op-
timization; (iii) in 46% of patients the MPP function was activated
early (i.e. before hospital discharge) and this percentage increased
to 53% at 6 months.
Multipoint pacing optimization:
keep it simple?
The beneficial effect of MPP is thought to depend on appropriate LV
pacing vectors and on inter-and intra-ventricular timing delays. Ow-
ing to the relatively short clinical experience with MPP-capable de-
vices and considering the high number of settings available, there is,
as yet, no agreement on the optimal setting of sequence and delays
in LV multipoint stimulations. In the present study, MPP program-
ming was left to the choice of the investigators; we therefore pro-
vide the first picture of how these devices are optimized in clinical
practice.
In this series, investigators used different strategies for guiding
MPP optimization. No echocardiographic-based optimization was
performed in the vast majority of patients. This is not surprising;
although echocardiography is widely used to optimize CRT pro-
gramming, it is time-consuming, especially in view of the high num-
ber of MPP configurations. Some investigators (34%) focused on the
latest LV pacing site activated, which is potentially associated with
improved CRT response;25 the integrated electrical delay measure-
ment software (CRT ToolkitTM St Jude Medical, Sylmar, CA, USA)
might facilitate measurement of the electrical activation of the four
LV electrodes, thereby allowing the earliest and latest LV pole to be
identified. Others used a more anatomic approach in which MPP
vectors were empirically chosen to pace both with the distal and
the most proximal LV electrode. Thibault et al.9 were the first to
show that this approach is frequently associated with the best
CRT response. Similarly, on using a pressure–volume loop to opti-
mize MPP, Pappone et al.10 found that the use of the widest anatom-
ically separated vectors is associated with improved CRT response.
In the present series, the most common method of MPP optimiza-
tion was based on the configuration that resulted in the greatest
narrowing of the QRS complex. QRS morphology and the reduc-
tion of its width has been, until now, one of the main goals of
CRT optimization. However, in MPP patients the effects of such op-
timization on chronic remodelling remain unknown. Notably, few
centres chose an approach guided by invasive or non-invasive
haemodynamic measurements. This is an important finding since
MPP-related improved clinical and echocardiographic response
has to date been observed mainly after invasive haemodynamic
optimization. Novel sophisticated techniques seem promising
means of optimizing CRT response but need adequate training
and refinement; it is likely that investigators preferred simpler and
less time-consuming strategies for guiding MPP optimization.26
The wide range of vectors and interval combinations does not
permit univocal programming of an MPP device and it is likely that
the final choice was also based on LV pacing thresholds and on

Multipoint LV pacing
 the optimal safety ratio with regard to PNS. Interestingly, despite the
theoretical CT and PNS issues, MPP was programmable in at least
90% of patients. In order to simplify the utilization of this tool, it is
important to establish clinical, anatomical, and electrical parameters
for the optimization of device programming and to find reasonable
empirical MPP settings. It is reasonable to suppose that any improve-
ment in this field will translate into improved CRT response, and
therefore into improved cost-effectiveness.
Multipoint pacing: treat or wait?
The choice and the timing of switching on the MPP function varied
widely among centres. Turning MPP ‘ON’ in the early post-
implantation phase was regarded as the best option by 58% of
centres, while 30% of centres left the function ‘OFF’ in the majority
of patients during the 6 months of follow-up. The reasons behind
this choice may be different. A possible explanation might be that
physicians are concerned about premature battery depletion,
though the real impact of MPP on battery longevity remains to be
determined. Thus, some clinicians might prefer a watch and wait
approach activating the MPP only in non-responders to conventional
CRT rather than turning it on soon after implantation. This strategy
is currently under investigation (MOre REsponse on Cardiac Resyn-
chronization Therapy with MultiPoint Pacing—the MORE-CRT
MPP study, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02006069). Differ-
ences in the characteristics of patients, physicians, and hospitals or
economic limitations may also account for these disparities.
The European CRT survey demonstrated considerable ‘off-label’
use of CRT devices in patients with a non-LBBB pattern or a narrow
QRS.27 There is a growing body of evidence that MPP might be most
beneficial in patients who are unlikely to benefit from standard CRT,
including those with myocardial scarring, a type I LV activation
pattern, and less marked QRS prolongation.28,29 Conversely, we
found that 6-month echocardiographic outcomes were statistically
improved in LBBB patients, in patients with non-ischaemic cardio-
myopathy, and in patients with QRS ≥ 150 ms. A trend towards
improved outcomes was also seen in their counterparts but it did
not reach statistical significance. It is likely that our study lacked
the power to reveal differences, as a result of the relatively small
number of patients with follow-up data. Further studies are needed
to address this issue.
With regard to CRT response, in a preliminary single-centre ex-
perience, Pappone et al.14,15 found that MPP improved echocardio-
graphic and clinical response to CRT. Extending the observations by
Pappone et al. to a large multi-centre experience, we observed that
MPP pacing resulted in a significant 6-month improvement in abso-
lute LVEF compared with conventional biventricular pacing. If these
observations are confirmed in larger series, we feel that early MPP
activation should be undertaken in order to improve the prognosis
of CRT patients.
Limitations
This study has potential limitations: (i) although our data were
collected in a single European country, they were nevertheless
derived from a multi-centre experience that brought together a
high number of centres with different workloads and reflecting
different behaviours. Thus, the mix of 76 participating centres might
provide a sufficiently representative sample of current clinical prac-
tice in Italy. (ii) The registry was entirely voluntary and did not em-
ploy a quality-control system for data collection nor an independent
system of monitoring. (iii) Clinical and echocardiographic outcome
analysis is inherently limited by the non-randomized design of the
study, and is therefore prone to the effects of confounding variables
even though no differences were detected between the groups in
terms of clinical characteristics. (iv) The implantation volume varied
considerably among the participating centres, and 6-month follow-
up data were available for a limited number of patients.
Although the existing registry data have inherent limitations, this
study provides the most detailed clinical record available and yields a
sufficiently representative sample of current clinical practice in Italy.
Conclusions
This study provides information that is essential in order to face
the expected increase in the number of patients treated with MPP
in the coming years. The results revealed different practices among
centres, and establishing the optimal programming in order to
maximize the benefit of MPP remains a challenging issue.

 Compared with conventional CRT, MPP reduced QRS duration.
Furthermore, MPP resulted in an additional increase in ejection
fraction and clinical composite response. Further investigation is re-
quired in order to better determine which patient populations
benefit most from these devices and to assess whether the implant-
ation of MPP-enabled CRT devices is superior and should become
the standard of care.
