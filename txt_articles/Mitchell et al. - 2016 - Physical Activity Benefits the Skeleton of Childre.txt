Abstract
Both genetics and physical activity (PA) contribute to bone mineral density (BMD), but it is 
unknown if the benefits of physical activity on childhood bone accretion depend on genetic risk. 
We therefore aimed to determine if PA influenced the effect of bone fragility genetic variants on 
BMD in childhood. Our sample comprised U.S. children of European ancestry enrolled in the 
Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (N=918, 5–19 years, and 52.4% female). We used a 
questionnaire to estimate hours per day spent in total, high, and low impact PA. We calculated a

 BMD genetic score (% BMD lowering alleles) using adult genome-wide association study 
(GWAS)-implicated BMD variants. We used dual energy X-ray absorptiometry to estimate 
femoral neck, total hip, and spine areal-BMD and total body less head (TBLH) bone mineral 
content (BMC) Z-scores. The BMD genetic score was negatively associated with each bone Z-
score (e.g. TBLH-BMC: estimate=−0.03, P=1.3×10−6). Total PA was positively associated with 
bone Z-scores; these associations were driven by time spent in high impact PA (e.g. TBLH-BMC: 
estimate=0.05, P=4.0×10−10); and were observed even for children with lower than average bone 
Z-scores. We found no evidence of PA-adult genetic score interactions (P-interaction >0.05) at any 
skeletal site, and there was no evidence of PA-genetic score-Tanner stage interactions at any 
skeletal site (P-interaction >0.05). However, exploratory analyses at the individual variant level 
revealed that PA statistically interacted with rs2887571 (ERC1/WNT5B) to influence TBLH-BMC 
in males (P-interaction=7.1×10−5), where PA was associated with higher TBLH-BMC Z-score 
among the BMD lowering allele carriers (rs2887571 AA homozygotes: estimate=0.08 [95% CI: 
0.06, 0.11], P=2.7×10−9). In conclusion, the beneficial effect of PA on bone, especially high 
impact PA, applies to the average child and those genetically predisposed to lower adult BMD 
(based on GWAS-implicated BMD variants). Independent replication of our exploratory individual 
variant findings is warranted.

Introduction
In the U.S., 10.3% of adults over 50 years of age have osteoporosis(1), with the prevalence 
highest among postmenopausal women (15.4%)(1). Enhancing bone accretion to maximize 
peak bone mass in early life could help reduce the risk of osteoporosis later in adulthood(2). 
Physical activity, especially high impact physical activity, is beneficial for bone 
accretion(3,4), yet benefits may vary across puberty stage(5). Most importantly, it is unknown 
whether physical activity equally benefits bone accretion in all children, particularly those 
who present with lower than average bone mineral density (BMD) and those who are 
genetically predisposed to adult bone fragility.
Physical activity-gene interaction studies to date have predominantly been performed in 
adults, used cross-sectional study designs, and investigated candidate genes thought to have 
a role in skeletal health(6–13). Only two cross-sectional pediatric studies, involving Finnish 
and Chinese females, have investigated if physical activity associations with BMD are 
influenced by candidate gene variants(14,15). More recently, genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS) identified loci that are robustly associated with BMD in adults(16–20). We 
previously demonstrated that a proportion of the adult GWAS implicated BMD loci were 
associated with BMD in children(21,22), with some associations sex and/or puberty stage 
dependent. It is unknown if physical activity interacts with variation at these same loci to 
influence BMD in childhood.

 We first tested if physical activity and overall BMD genetic risk score were associated with 
areal bone mineral density (aBMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) in children. Our 
primary aim was to determine whether physical activity interacted with BMD genetic risk 
score to influence aBMD and BMC. We further investigated whether physical activity, BMD 
genetic risk score and maturation interacted to influence aBMD and BMC. We also 
performed exploratory analyses with each individual single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
comprising the BMD genetic score.
Materials and Methods
Participants
The Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS) established norms for aBMD and 
BMC in healthy U.S. children aged 5–19 years(23). Participants aged 6–18 years were 
recruited in 2002–2003, and annual follow-ups occurred until 2008–2009 at five sites (Los 
Angeles, CA; Cincinnati, OH; Omaha, NE; Philadelphia, PA; and New York, NY)(23). The 
study was extended to include 5 and 19 years olds beginning in 2006–2007; these younger 
and older participants completed annual follow-up until 2008–2009. Inclusion and exclusion 
criteria are listed in Supplemental Table 1. Blood or saliva was collected at the final visit, 
from which DNA was extracted. For the present study each participant’s population ancestry 
was determined using whole genome genotyping data by principal components analysis and 
admixture(24). Participants of European ancestry were included in this analysis (N=918 [a 
total of 452 non-European ancestry participants were not included in the analyses]), as the 
tag SNPs being investigated have only been validated in European populations(16–20). In 
2010, a cross-sectional sample of 486 European ancestry children aged 5–18 years were 
enrolled at two sites(Cincinnati, OH and Omaha, NE) to serve as the “replication cohort” to 
help validate findings in the original “discovery cohort”; the same inclusion and exclusion 
criteria were used for the replication cohort (Supplemental Table 1). Written informed 
consent was obtained for participants ≥18 years; participants <18 years provided assent 
along with consent from a parent or guardian. The Institutional Review Boards at each site 
approved the BMDCS study protocol.
Genotyping
DNA samples were SNP genotyped genome-wide at the Children’s Hospital of 
Philadelphia’s Center for Applied Genomics using high-throughput technology: 
IlluminaInfinium™ II OMNI Express plus ExomeBeadChip (Illumina, San Diego)(25). We 
investigated 67 SNPs near known adult bone mass loci(16,18,20,26). SNPs were modeled 
under an additive model. The BMD genotype risk score was calculated as a percentage of 
the number of “lowering BMD risk alleles” carried.
Physical Activity
Physical activity was estimated using the modified Slemenda questionnaire that included 
activities related to sports, leisure and activities of daily living(27). This questionnaire has 
been used in previous studies and indirect validity has been demonstrated through 
associations with bone phenotypes(4,27). Total number of hours in the past week spent in 
each physical activity was queried. Times spent in high impact physical activities were

 summed to generate the high impact physical activity variable (weight bearing physical 
activities with a ground reaction force greater than 2× body weight involving sprinting, 
turning or jumping actions [Supplemental Table 2]). Times spent in low impact physical 
activities were summed to generate the low impact physical activity variable(non-weight-
bearing physical activities or weight-bearing physical activities with a ground reaction force 
of 1–2× body weight [Supplemental Table 2]). Trained research assistants checked the 
questionnaires for completion and accuracy.
Bone Mass and Content Outcomes
Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans of the lumbar spine, proximal femur and 
total body were obtained using Hologic, Inc. (Bedford, MA) bone densitometers 
(QDR4500A, QDR4500W, Delphi A and Apex models). Scans were analyzed at the 
University of California, San Francisco’s DXA Core Laboratory using Hologic software 
(Discovery 12.3 at baseline and Apex 2.1 at post-baseline study visits using the “compare” 
feature). Spine, total hip and femoral neck aBMD, and total body less head (TBLH) BMC 
values were adjusted based on the cross-calibration of DXA devices and longitudinal 
calibration stability. TBLH BMC (rather than aBMD) was used because it is the preferred 
measure of bone status for the total body when adjusted for body size(28). aBMD and BMC 
Z-scores were calculated using the BMDCS reference values to account for known increases 
and sex differences in aBMD/BMC during growth(23). aBMD and BMC-Z were adjusted for 
height-for-age Z-scores to minimize potential confounding by skeletal size(29).
Covariates
Height (m) and weight (kg) were measured(23), and body mass index (BMI) Z-scores 
calculated using U.S. standards(30). Pubertal stage was assessed by physicians or nurses with 
expertise in pediatric endocrinology. Participants were categorized as pre-pubertal, pubertal 
and post-pubertal (Tanner stages I, II to IV, and V, respectively)(31). Dietary calcium intakes 
(g/d) were assessed using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (Block Dietary 
Data Systems, Berkeley, CA)(32), which included forty-five food and beverage items. 
Trained research assistants checked the questionnaires for completion and accuracy.
Statistical Analysis
The number of study visits per participant ranged from 1 to 7. Analyses were performed 
separately by sex, and for both sexes combined (opposite sex siblings were included in the 
BMDCS; for the sex combined analyses we removed the older sibling [N=113]). Sex 
stratified analyses were done because bone accretion timing and rates differ for males and 
females; males achieve higher peak bone mass(33); and bone fragility in later life is more 
common among females(1). Furthermore, our past genetic studies using BMDCS data 
demonstrate evidence of sex differences(21,22,34). An overview of our analyses is provided in 
Supplemental Table 3.
We first investigated if physical activity and genetic risk score were independently 
associated with bone Z-scores using mixed-effects linear regression, with subject-level 
random intercepts to account for the correlation between repeated measures. The Huber-
White approach was used to construct robust standard errors using thevce (robust) option in

 Stata. The model included the time-invariant genetic risk score and time-variant physical 
activity variables. One set of models tested total physical activity; another set combined low 
and high impact physical activity variables in the same models. All models were adjusted for 
the time-variant covariates: age, BMI Z-score, dietary calcium and puberty stage. We also 
used longitudinal quantile regression to investigate if the physical activity variables were 
associated with bone Z-scores for children with below average and above average bone Z-
scores(35,36), adjusting for the same covariates. For these analyses, P<0.05 was used to 
determine associations between physical activity and bone Z-scores and genetic risk score 
and bone Z-scores.
We then tested for total physical activity interactions with genetic risk score, using mixed-
effects linear regression, as well as three-way interactions between total physical activity, 
puberty stage and genetic risk score (the lower order two-way interactions were included). 
The latter three-way interactions were to determine if physical activity and pubertal stage 
modified any genetic associations, as physical activity may be particularly important for 
bone accrual before full maturation is attained(5). For interaction analyses involving the 
genetic risk score, P<0.05 was used to determine if there were statistical significant 
interactions.
We may not be powered to identify physical activity interaction with the individual variants 
that comprise the genetic risk score, so we consider these analyses to be exploratory. For 
these exploratory interaction analyses involving individual variants, we applied the 
Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate approach to account for the 67 independent 
loci investigated. Total physical activity was used first in the interaction analyses. If we 
observed statistical evidence of an interaction that survived correction for multiple testing, 
we repeated the analysis using high and low impact physical activity. For interaction P-
values that survived correction for multiple testing, we tested our findings both in the 
replication cohort and in the discovery and replication cohorts combined. We used Stata 12.0 
(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) to conduct all analyses. Importantly, because we 
modeled bone Z-scores negative estimates indicate that a predictor is associated with lower 
bone mass expected for age and sex. Positive estimates indicate that a predictor is associated 
with higher bone mass expected for age and sex. Therefore, estimates not statistically 
different from zero indicate that a predictor is associated with maintenance of bone mass 
expected for age and sex.
Results
The discovery cohort comprised 918 participants of European descent (female, N=481; 
Table 1). The males averaged 1.8 hours per day of total physical activity (71% reporting ≥1 
hr/d), and the females averaged 1.5 hours per day of total physical activity(62% reporting ≥1 
hr/d). The proportions of time spent in high impact physical activity and low impact physical 
activity were 42% and 58% in males, respectively; and 35% and 65% in females, 
respectively. Similar physical activity patterns were observed in the cross-sectional 
replication cohort comprising 486 participants (female, N=245; Supplementary Table 4).

 Total physical activity was positively associated with average bone Z-scores (Table 2). This 
association was driven entirely by time spent in high impact physical activity; time spent in 
low impact physical activity was not associated with higher or lower bone Z-scores (Table 
2). For example, each hour per day spent in high impact physical activity associated with 
0.05 higher TBLH-BMC Z-score in males and females (95% confidence interval: 0.03, 0.06; 
P=4.0×10−10). The genetic risk score (% BMD lowering alleles) was associated with lower 
bone Z-scores (Table 2). For example, each 1% increase in the genetic risk score associated 
with 0.03 lower TBLH-BMC Z-score in males and females (95% confidence interval: −0.04, 
−0.02; P=1.3×10−6).
The total physical activity associations, driven by high impact physical activity, were evident 
even for children with below average bone Z-scores who may be at genetic risk for future 
bone fragility; these findings were derived from the quantile regression models (Figure 1 and 
Supplemental Figures 1 and 2). Further support that physical activity benefits the skeleton of 
all children, we found no statistical evidence that physical activity interacted with genetic 
risk scoreto influence bone Z-scores. Also, there was no evidence that physical activity 
associations differed by genetic risk score and pubertal stages to influence bone Z-scores 
(i.e. no physical activity-genetic risk score-maturation statistical interaction). Physical 
activity associations with each bone Z-score by genetic score tertiles are illustrated in Figure 
2 to show the comparable physical activity associations across genetic susceptibility bone 
fragility groups.
We next performed exploratory analyses that investigated physical activity interactions 
involving that the individual variants used to calculate the genetic risk score. A significant 
interaction between total physical activity and one variant was observed that passed 
correction for multiple testing. Specifically, total physical activity statistically interacted 
with rs2887571 (ERC1/WNT5B) to influence TBLH-BMC (Table 3). This interaction 
survived correction for multiple testing in males (P=7.1×10−5), was nominally significant in 
females (P=0.027), and was significant in males and females combined (P=6.7×10−4). 
Overall, among rs2887571 risk (BMC lowering) A allele homozygotes, total physical 
activity was positively associated with TBLH-BMC Z-score (estimate=0.03, P=8.2×10−6) 
and this was driven by high impact physical activity (Supplemental Table 6 and 
Supplemental Figure 3). However, this exploratory finding did not reach statistical 
significance in the cross-sectional replication cohort (Table 3). Note, using a more 
conservative multiple correction approach to account for the 4 skeletal sites, and for 
conducting analyses for both sexes combined and separately for males and females (P-
interaction < 6.2×10−5 [0.05/804]), the total physical activity interaction with rs2887571 
remains only in males. No other physical activity interactions with the individual variants 
passed correction for multiple testing. However, a number of nominally significant total 
physical activity-SNP interactions (P<0.05) were observed and these variants are listed in 
Supplemental Table 5.
We also conducted exploratory analyses that tested for statistical interactions between total 
physical activity, each SNP and puberty stage in order to determine whether associations 
between physical activity and bone Z-scores for a given variant were different according to 
puberty stage. Interactions involving two SNPs were statistically significant for total hip and

 femoral neck Z-scores in females: rs6959212 (STARD3NL) and rs9303521 (CRHR1) 
(Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Figures 4 and 5). However, these interaction P-
values were not statistically significant in the cross-sectional replication cohort 
(Supplementary Table 7). Furthermore, using a more conservative multiple correction 
approach to account for the 4 skeletal sites, and for conducting analyses for both sexes 
combined and separately for males and females (P-interaction < 6.2×10−5 [0.05/804]), the 
interactions involving these two variants would not be considered statistically significant.
Discussion
Longitudinal studies(37), including BMDCS(4), and randomized controlled trials(3) have 
demonstrated the importance of physical activity to promote bone accretion and 
development of peak bone mass. Our longitudinal study is the first to investigate differential 
effects of physical activity across the spectrum of pediatric bone Z-scores, as well as 
physical activity-gene interactions on childhood bone Z-scores using adult GWAS-
implicated bone density loci. We found that total physical activity, driven by high impact 
physical activity, was positively associated with bone Z-scores, and genetic risk score was 
negatively associated with childhood bone Z-scores. Interestingly, the physical activity 
benefits included children with lower than average bone Z-scores, as well as children 
genetically predisposed to lower adult BMD (i.e. no physical activity-genetic risk score 
interactions). Furthermore, in our exploratory analyses we observed a statistical interaction 
between total physical activity and a SNP near the ERC1/WNT5B locus. Importantly, total 
physical activity and high impact physical activity associations with TBLH-BMC were 
beneficial for children carrying the BMD lowering risk allele at this locus. Therefore, U.S. 
children genetically predisposed to lower adult BMD as defined by GWAS-implicated 
variants should aim to meet the physical activity guidelines and increase their high impact 
physical activity to enhance or maintain age-appropriate bone accretion(38). This conclusion 
is reinforced with our other exploratory observations in females that some total physical 
activity-gene interactions varied across puberty stage in females, but high impact physical 
activity was associated with maintenance or higher bone Z-scores regardless of genetics or 
puberty stage.
Previous related studies adopted cross-sectional study designs, investigated candidate bone 
density genes primarily in adult populations, and found little to no evidence that physical 
activity interacted with these loci to influence aBMD in adults(6,9–13). Importantly, these 
candidate loci have not (yet) been associated with aBMD in GWAS(20), except for common 
variation near LRP5 in adult populations(16,20). LRP5 is a co-receptor in the WNT signaling 
pathway, which is critical for mechanosensation(39). Kiel et al. found physical activity 
interactions with SNPs near the LRP5 locus for spine aBMD in adult males(8). We did not 
replicate this finding in children. However, in our exploratory analyses we observed nominal 
evidence of statistical interactions with other WNT signaling loci (WNT5B, WNT16, 
AXIN1, SOST and STARD3NL). Our most robust total physical activity interaction 
involved the WNT5B locus and TBLH-BMC. These associations are biologically plausible 
because of the role of the WNT signaling pathway in mechanosensitivity of the skeleton, as 
supported by mechanical loading studies of animals with Lrp5 and Sost mutations(39,40).

 We previously reported significant sex differences involving some of the 67 GWAS 
implicated adult BMD loci with childhood bone outcomes(21) and that the genetic risk score 
effect was stronger and more consistent in females(22). Here we further observed in our 
exploratory analyses that some physical activity interactions were sex-specific. For example, 
among females we observed statistically significant interactions involving total physical 
activity, puberty stage and SNPs near the STARD3NL (WNT signaling pathway) and 
CRHR1 loci with regard to hip aBMD Z-scores. The observed sex and pubertal stage 
specific interactions could be due to male and female preferences for types of physical 
activities along with changes in physical activity levels from early to late maturation(41). 
Indeed, females spent less time in high impact physical activity compared to males. 
Variation in sex hormones contributing to bone accretion could also affect the sex and 
pubertal stage specific associations(5), as could sex and pubertal stage differences in lean 
mass(42). Improving our understanding of these sex differences and physical activity effects 
on bone is in line with current NIH priorities(43).
The medical and public health fields have an important role to play in promoting physical 
activity guidelines for Americans(38,44). Based on our findings, future physical activity 
guidelines should consider the proportion of high versus low impact physical activity for 
bone health. Indeed, for children spending 1 hour per day in total physical activity, we 
estimate that bone Z-scores would be 0.06 greater if 100% were dedicated to high impact 
physical activity versus 100% low impact physical activity. In cumulative terms, a female 
between ages 10 and 16 years could move from the 5th to the 10th percentile, without 
changing her total physical activity, but increasing her proportion of high impact physical 
activity. Furthermore, with advances in precision medicine, genetic predisposition data will 
one-day be routinely used in pediatric practice. We tested if children genetically predisposed 
to bone fragility in adulthood, based on GWAS-implicated BMD variants, responded to 
physical activity exposure. Based on our results, pediatricians at this time can recommend 
high impact physical activity to aid life-long bone health, in generally healthy children, even 
if they carry a large proportion of GWAS-implicated BMD lowering alleles. However, this 
recommendation should be continuously assessed as our understanding of the genetic 
regulation of the developing skeleton advances; our study findings can only be interpreted in 
the context of GWAS-implicated BMD variant; future studies could identify genetic variants 
that do impact the responsiveness of the pediatric skeleton to physical activity exposure.
Our study has several strengths. Our longitudinal study design spanned early to late 
maturation. We used rigorously acquired aBMD and BMC-Z measures from multiple 
skeletal sites and applied quantile regression to investigate physical activity associations for 
children with below average bone Z-scores. Our study also has some limitations. The 
GWAS-implicated variants only partly explain the variance in adult BMD (≈6%)(20), and 
our study cannot rule out that other genetic variants could influence how the pediatric 
skeleton responds to physical activity exposure. Our physical activity questionnaire allowed 
for estimation of high and low impact physical activity. While accelerometry offers a more 
objective approach to estimating physical activity, it is important to note that accelerometry 
is unable to accurately estimate physical activity while performing certain non-weight 
bearing activities (e.g. cycling and swimming). Nonetheless, it will be important to replicate 
our findings using other physical activity methods, including accelerometry. Other factors,

 such as calcium intake, may modulate the effect of physical activity on bone accretion(45). In 
addition, we did not have vitamin D data to test if insufficiency states affected our results. 
Our findings can only be generalized to U.S. children of European descent. We only 
included participants of European ancestry due to the fact that the BMD lowering alleles we 
include in our study have only been established to date to yield associations in populations 
of European ancestry and may well not tag the underlying causative variants among other 
ethnicities(20). As such, it will be important to conduct this research in other ancestry groups 
using optimal tag-SNPs for each ethnicity in future studies. Follow-up studies using other 
modalities to estimate additional bone phenotypes are needed. Finally, our replication cohort 
included cross-sectional data; repeated measures would have conferred additional statistical 
power.
In conclusion, the benefits of physical activity on bone accretion apply to children with 
below average aBMD/BMC and to those who carry a large proportion of GWAS-implicated 
BMD lowering alleles. Children should be encouraged to increase their total physical 
activity and dedicate a greater proportion of their time to high impact physical activity to 
enhance or maintain age appropriate bone accretion.

 Figure 1. 
Physical activity associations with bone Z-score percentiles in males and females combined. 
The associations for total (triangles), high impact (squares) and low impact (circles) physical 
activity are presented. The percentiles were modeled using longitudinal quantile regression 
to represent below average (<50th percentile), average (50th percentile) and above average 
(>50th percentile) bone Z-scores. The models were puberty stage, body mass index Z-score 
and genetic risk score. The percentile specific estimates and 95% confidence intervals 
represent the change in Z-score for each 1-hour per day increase in physical activity. The 
estimates statistically different from zero are indicated: *P≤0.01, **P≤0.001 and 
***P≤1.0×10−4.

The estimates for the physical activity variables represent the change in bone Z-scores per additional hour per day spent physically active. The estimates for the genetic risk score represent the change in 
bone Z-score per additional 1% increase in the genetic risk score.
aGenetic risk score, percentage of the number of lowering bone mineral density alleles carried at 63 loci identified in an adult genome wide association study(20).
aHigh Impact Physical Activity, hours per day spent in weight bearing physical activity with a ground reaction force >2× body weight.
aLow Impact Physical Activity, hours per day spent in non-weight bearing physical activity or weight bearing physical activity with a ground reaction force 1–2× body weight. All analyses involved 
participants in the longitudinal discovery cohort using linear mixed models; adjusted for age, puberty stage, body mass index Z-score, and dietary calcium intake (gender was included as a covariate in the 
male and females combined analyses with older sibling was removed). In model 1, total physical activity and genetic risk score were included with the covariates. In model 2, low and high impact physical 
activity, as well as genetic risk score, were included with the covariates. Abbreviations: TBLH-BMC, total body less head bone mineral content.

The estimates represent the change in bone Z-scores per additional hour per day spent physically active, by rs2887571 genotype.
aRisk allele was associated with lower bone mineral density in a genome-wide association study of adults(20).
bDiscovery: Analyses involving participants in the longitudinal discovery cohort using linear mixed models; Replication: Analyses involving participants in the cross-sectional replication cohort using linear 
regression; Both: Analyses involving participants in the discovery and replication cohorts using linear mixed models; all models were adjusted for age, puberty stage, body mass index Z-score, and dietary 
calcium intake (gender was included as a covariate in the male and females combined analyses; older sibling was removed for the male and female combined analyses). P-interactions in bold survive 
correction for multiple testing for 67 independent loci. Abbreviations: F, female; M, male; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; TB, total body less head bone mineral content.
