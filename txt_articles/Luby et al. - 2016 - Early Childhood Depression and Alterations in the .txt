IMPORTANCE The trajectory of cortical gray matter development in childhood has been
characterized by early neurogenesis and volume increase, peaking at puberty followed by
selective elimination and myelination, resulting in volume loss and thinning. This inverted
U-shaped trajectory, as well as cortical thickness, has been associated with cognitive and
emotional function. Synaptic pruning–based volume decline has been related to
experience-dependent plasticity in animals. To date, there have been no data to inform
whether and how childhood depression might be associated with this trajectory.
OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of early childhood depression, from the preschool age to
the school age period, on cortical gray matter development measured across 3 waves of
neuroimaging from late school age to early adolescence.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data were collected in an academic research setting
from September 22, 2003, to December 13, 2014, on 193 children aged 3 to 6 years from the
St Louis, Missouri, metropolitan area who were observed for up to 11 years in a longitudinal
behavioral and neuroimaging study of childhood depression. Multilevel modeling was applied
to explore the association between the number of childhood depression symptoms and prior
diagnosis of major depressive disorder and the trajectory of gray matter change across 3 scan
waves. Data analysis was conducted from October 29, 2014, to September 28, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Volume, thickness, and surface area of cortical gray matter
measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging at 3 scan waves.
RESULTS Of the 193 children, 90 had a diagnosis of major depressive disorder; 116 children
had 3 full waves of neuroimaging scans. Findings demonstrated marked alterations in cortical
gray matter volume loss (slope estimate, −0.93 cm3; 95% CI, −1.75 to −0.10 cm3 per scan
wave) and thinning (slope estimate, −0.0044 mm; 95% CI, −0.0077 to −0.0012 mm per scan
wave) associated with experiencing an episode of major depressive disorder before the first
magnetic resonance imaging scan. In contrast, no significant associations were found
between development of gray matter and family history of depression or experiences of
traumatic or stressful life events during this period.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study demonstrates an association between early
childhood depression and the trajectory of cortical gray matter development in late school
age and early adolescence. These findings underscore the significance of early childhood
depression on alterations in neural development.

L
ongitudinal studies of childhood structural brain devel-
opment using magnetic resonance imaging in healthy
children have begun to map the normative pattern of de-
velopment of gray matter from school age through
adolescence.1 Although development of gray matter begins in
utero, there has been much interest in its trajectory during the
school-age and early adolescent period.2 The specific cellular
processes that underlie gray matter change during this pe-
riod in humans remain to be elucidated. In contrast with white
matter, which shows linear increases in volume, findings sug-
gest a pattern of rapid neurogenesis and related increases in
gray matter volume during early childhood, peaking in early
puberty followed by a process of selective elimination and my-
elination, resulting in volume loss and thinning.3-5 The in-
verted U-shaped trajectory of the development of cortical and
subcortical gray matter regions is influenced by sex, pubertal
status, IQ, and genetic and psychosocial factors.6,7 The char-
acteristics of this inverted U-shaped trajectory for gray mat-
terhavebeenassociatedwithfunctionacrossseveraldomains.5
Moreimportant,associationsbetweencorticalthickness,mood
regulation, and executive functioning have been demon-
strated in cross-sectional analyses.8,9 There is some evidence
that this synaptic pruning–based volume decline is associ-
atedwithexperience-dependentplasticity.10-12Thenotionthat
the rate of decline of cortical gray matter in humans could vary
based on history of experience has powerful public health im-
plications.
Building on advances in mapping the normative trajec-
tory of gray matter development, there has been escalating in-
terest in whether symptoms of childhood psychiatric disor-
dersand/orgeneticpredispositiontopsychiatricdisordersalter
thistrajectory.Asmanymajorpsychiatricdisordersarethought
to be neurodevelopmental, investigations of whether and how
childhood mood and emotional functioning might alter this
trajectory is of great interest and represents a critical gap in
the literature on developmental neuroscience. Alterations in
maturation of gray matter have been detected in some child-
hood psychiatric disorders.13-15 A pattern of loss of cortical gray
matter during adolescence, consistent with the normative pro-
cess but at an accelerated rate, has been observed in children
with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.16,17 This pattern of ac-
celerated loss of gray matter may be interpreted as reflecting
synaptic pruning taking place earlier in development, before
being fully informed by the effects of broader experience.

been very few data on longitudinal imaging to inform whether
childhood depression is also associated with alterations in de-
velopmentofgraymatter.Giventheknowncognitiveandemo-
tional impairments in children with depression, accelerated
reductions in cortical gray matter development are
hypothesized.20
In one of the only available longitudinal imaging studies
in which adolescents at high and low risk for depression un-
derwent neuroimaging twice, volumetric changes in the hip-
pocampus, putamen, and amygdala were found, but no
changes in cortical gray matter were reported.21 In contrast,
in a cross-sectional study of the 6- to 54-year-old offspring of
depressed parents, cortical gray matter thinning across the lat-
eral surface of the right hemisphere was reported in high-risk
participants vs controls and was associated with current symp-
tom severity.9 The lack of longitudinal imaging data in child

Thisgapisimportantgiventhatdepressionhasbeenshown

ity evidenced by numerous neurobehavioral markers, includ-
ing alterations in the function and structure of key brain re-
gions involved in emotion processing.22-25 More important,

depression in later childhood that meets DSM-5 criteria, sug-
gesting that it is an early manifestation of the well-validated
childhood and adolescent disorder.26 Our current investiga-
tion uses data from an ongoing 11-year longitudinal study of
early childhood depression to examine the effects of child-
hood depression on the trajectory of cortical gray matter de-
velopment, accounting for sex, age, IQ, poverty, family his-
tory of depression, and adverse experiences. Cortical gray
matter volume was the primary variable because it is the most
global metric. Significant volume findings were followed up
by separate analyses of thickness and surface area, as they can
have differential developmental trajectories, genetic influ-
ences, and patterns of impairment across neuropsychiatric
conditions.27-29
In addition to behavioral data across 8 annual (and nu-
merous semiannual) waves, 3 waves of neuroimaging during
school age and early adolescence were obtained. Neuroimag-
ing was initiated in this sample (first scan) just past the age of
peak cortical growth for most children and maps the down-
ward slope of the inverted U-shaped curve during pruning and
myelination, both key processes contributing to volume re-
duction and thinning as assessed in human neuroimaging
studies.30,31 The available data allow an unprecedented inves-
tigation into the association of childhood depression with the
trajectories of cortical gray matter development across late
school age and early adolescence.
Methods
Two hundred eleven children participated in a longitudinal
studyofpreschooldepressionfromSeptember22,2003,toDe-
cember13,2014,comprising3wavesofneuroimaging.Healthy
children and those with a history of depression were invited
to participate and undergo neuroimaging (see eFigure 1 in the
Supplement for exclusion criteria). One hundred ninety-
three children had useable IQ data and neuroimaging data at
1 or more waves. Before and at the time of the first scan, chil-
dren participated in behavioral assessments comprising 1 to 7
annual (and 1-4 semiannual) waves. These assessments in-
cluded parent and child report using age-appropriate psychi-

reliability of the major depressive disorider (MDD) module in
the PAPA to identify depression in preschool-aged children
(using a 6-month primary period) have been previously
established.34,35 In addition, demographic, psychosocial (in-
cluding stressful and traumatic life events assessed using the
PAPA or CAPA), and developmental characteristics were also
assessed (life events detailed in eTable 1 in the Supplement).34
To examine the effect of socioeconomic status on structural
brain outcomes, we used a ratio of income to needs, defined
as the income level of the family divided by the federal pov-
ertylinebyfamilysize.Achildhooddepressionsymptomnum-
ber score that spanned the preschool-age through school-age
period (P-SA-MDD) was calculated for each participant by tak-
ing the mean number of core symptoms of MDD endorsed at
all behavioral assessment waves using the PAPA and/or CAPA
before and concurrent with and including the first scan. Dur-
ing this period, participants completed a mean (SD) of 5.48
(2.80)(range,1-11)behavioralassessments.Wealsocreatedcat-
egorical groups based on history of diagnoses of MDD in the
same period. The Child Depression Inventory (CDI) parent and
child reports were completed at the time of neuroimaging. In
addition, the Family Interview for Genetic Studies was used
to assess for family history of depression in first- and second-
degree relatives.36 All study methods were reviewed and ap-
proved by the Washington University School of Medicine In-
stitutionalReviewBoard.Writteninformedconsentandassent
were obtained from all study participants. Data analysis was
conducted from October 29, 2014, to September 28, 2015.
Participants underwent neuroimaging with a magnetic
resonance imaging scanner (model 3.0-T Tim Trio; Siemens
Healthcare GmbH). The 2 results of magnetization-prepared
rapid acquisition gradient echo scans were assessed visually,
and the best one was selected for further processing by blinded
raters. The selected magnetization-prepared rapid acquisi-
tion gradient echo image for each wave was processed using
the longitudinal stream in FreeSurfer software package, ver-
sion 5.3 (surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu).37 Several processing
steps, such as skull stripping, Talairach transformations, and
atlas registration, as well as spherical surface maps and par-
cellations, were initialized with common information from an
unbiased within-patient template. This longitudinal stream re-
duces the bias that would otherwise be present in selecting a
single scan result as baseline, and significantly increases reli-
ability and statistical power.38 Further details of FreeSurfer
methods are available in eAppendix 1 in the Supplement.
Thelongitudinalmultilevellinearmodel(MLM)wasimple-
mented in SAS, version 9.3 (PROC MIXED; SAS Institute, Inc).
The growth curve model included both random intercept and
random slope components (with an unstructured covariance
matrix between the 2 components). Time was coded as wave
number. All models included the following covariates: age at
first neuroimaging scan (centered at mean = 10.3 years), qua-
dratic age at first neuroimaging scan, sex (male, 1; female, 0),
ratio of income to needs at first neuroimaging scan (centered
at mean = 1.74), and IQ (centered at 105.6). We also consid-
ered an MLM that included an autoregressive estimate of co-
variance between neuroimaging waves in the model residu-
als. However, this model had convergence problems with
defaultsettings,andevenafterachievingconvergenceviamore
lenientconvergenceparameters,themodelfitstatistics(Akaike
tj;3information criterion, Akaike information criterion cor-
rected for infinite sample sizes, Bayesian information crite-
rion) favored the simpler growth-curve only model. Degrees
of freedom calculations used the method of Kenward and
Roger.39
Results
Participant characteristics at each neuroimaging scan are pro-
vided in Table 1. Of the 193 participants, 90 had lifetime MDD.
eFigure 1 in the Supplement details the study flow, including
dropout rates and reasons. The P-SA-MDD score was signifi-
cantly different in depressed participants than in those with-
out depression (eAppendix 2 in the Supplement).
A longitudinal MLM was conducted to examine the effect
of P-SA-MDD symptom scores (centered at mean = 2.2) on ini-
tial values and change in global cortical gray volume. Growth
trajectories (intercept, reflecting initial values, and linear
change across time) were estimated for each participant. The
P-SA-MDD symptom scores were used to predict variation in
intercept and linear change over time (defined as neuroimag-
ing scan number). Quadratic models were considered but the
quadratic term was nonsignificant, indicating linear trajecto-
ries across time.
The longitudinal growth model result for gray matter vol-
ume is shown in Table 2. There was a main effect of time (B,
−7.80; SE, = 0.61; t, = −12.73; P < .001), indicating that youths’
cortical gray volume decreased significantly across neuroim-
aging scan waves, consistent with normative gray matter re-
duction seen at the age range studied. In addition, male sex,
higher ratio of income to needs, and higher IQ scores were sig-
nificantlyassociatedwithlargervolume.Moreimportant,there
was a significant interaction between the P-SA-MDD symp-
tom score and time, indicating that global cortical gray vol-
ume decreased faster for those with higher P-SA-MDD symp-
tomscores(eFigure2intheSupplement).Specifically,children
with a mean P-SA-MDD score of 5 (the number of symptoms
needed for a diagnosis of MDD and almost 2 SDs above the
mean) had a 1.81 times greater decrease in global cortical vol-
ume from the first neuroimaging scan to the third compared
with children with a mean MDD severity of 0 (–3.65% vs
–2.02%).Figure1showsindividuallyestimatedgraymattervol-
ume slopes as a function of P-SA-MDD symptom score.
To better understand the association of P-SA-MDD symp-
tom score with gray matter decline, we conducted MLMs for
global (mean) cortical thickness and global cortical area of the
gray and white matter surface to determine which of these fac-
tors was contributing to the volume changes. As shown in
Table 2, we saw a significant interaction between P-SA-MDD
symptom score and time for global cortical thickness (Figure 2
and eFigure 2 in the Supplement), such that children with a
P-SA-MDD symptom score of 5 had a 1.69 times greater de-
crease in cortical thickness from the first neuroimaging scan

to the third compared with those with a mean MDD score of 0
(–3.93%vs–2.33%).NoevidencewasfoundforaneffectofMDD
symptom score on change in global cortical surface area
(Table 2). However, main effects of time, sex, and IQ score in-
dicated that the surface area decreased with time and that
malesandthosewithhigherIQscoreshadgreatersurfaceareas.
Additional MLMs conducted separately for the left and right
brain hemisphere indicated a significant interaction of P-SA-
MDD symptom score with time in gray matter volume in the
left hemisphere (P = .02), a marginally significant interaction
in gray matter volume in the right hemisphere (P = .05), and
significant interactions in both hemispheres for gray matter
thickness (eTable 2 in the Supplement). These effects for vol-
umeandgraymatterthicknessweresubstantivelyidenticaland
significant for trend level when the analyses were run sepa-
rately for males and females, even though these analyses each
had approximately half the sample size (eTable 3 and eTable
4 in the Supplement).
To aid in clinical interpretation, the models were run again
using the dichotomous variable of MDD diagnosis before or
concurrent with the first neuroimaging scan. The interaction
between MDD and time was significant for volume (B, 2.84;
SE, 1.24; t, 2.29; P = .02) and thickness (B, 0.0132; SE, 0.0049;
t, 2.70; P = .008) but not surface area (B, 1.45; SE, 1.52; t, 0.96;
P = .34), as was seen in the models of P-SA-MDD symptom
scores.
When child-reported CDI score was used in the model, the
interaction between CDI total T score and time was sig-
nificant for volume (B, –0.26; SE, 0.10; t, –2.46; P = .02) and
thickness (B, –0.0013; SE, 0.0004; t, –3.27; P = .001) but not

surface area (B, –0.11; SE, 0.13; t, –0.81; P = .42). Results for par-
ent- reported CDI score were going in the same direction (eAp-
pendix 2 in the Supplement).
To further investigate the specificity of this effect for de-
pression (vs psychotropic exposure), models were rerun re-
moving participants with any lifetime psychotropic medica-
tion use, resulting in a sample size of 156. Despite this reduced
sample size and elimination of some of the children with the
most severe depression who received medication (mean P-SA-
MDD symptom score before the first neuroimaging scan, 3.74
vs 1.85 for those with and without medication exposure, re-
spectively; t, 8.27; df, 191; P < .001), similar results to those in
the models with all children were found (eAppendix 2 in the
Supplement).
Childhood depression is frequently comorbid with exter-
nalizing disorders, which are also associated with alterations
in volume and/or thickness of gray matter.40 To determine
whether patterns of gray matter change held when account-
ing for comorbid externalizing disorders, we reran the mod-
els including the presence of externalizing disorder (attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder,
or conduct disorder) before the first neuroimaging scan and
its interaction with time as additional covariates. The esti-
mates, SEs, and significance of the interactions of P-SA-MDD
symptom score with time were similar to those in the models
that did not include externalizing disorders, again demon-
strating greater declines in global volume of cortical gray mat-
ter (B, –1.09, SE, 0.51; t, –2.15; P = .03) and global thickness of
cortical gray matter (B, –0.0044; SE, 0.0020; t, –2.22; P = .03)
for those with higher P-SA-MDD symptom scores.
To explore whether the association between P-SA-MDD
symptom score and cortical gray matter development might
reflect the influence of the early experience of depression vs
a familial or genetically influenced outcome, we included fam-
ilyhistoryofdepression(apotentialmarkerofgeneticrisk)and
its interaction with time as covariates in the models and found
that the interaction of P-SA-MDD symptom score and time re-
mained significant for global volume of cortical gray matter (B,
–1.04; SE, 0.42; t, –2.44; P = .02) and global thickness of cor-
tical gray matter (B, –0.0050; SE, 0.0017; t, –3.00; P = .003)
and remained nonsignificant for global surface area of corti-
cal gray matter (B, –0.53; SE, 0.53; t, –1.01; P = .32). To inves-
tigate whether the effect was specific to experiences of de-
pressionorbasedonmoregeneralformsofadversity,additional
models included experiences of traumatic and stressful life
events and their interaction with time as model covariates.
Again, the interaction of P-SA-MDD symptom score and time
remained significant for volume of cortical gray matter (B,
–0.95; SE, 0.43; t, –2.19; P = .03) and thickness of cortical gray
matter (B, –0.0046; SE, 0.0017; t, –2.75; P = .007) and re-
mained nonsignificant for surface area of cortical gray matter
(B, –0.46; SE, 0.53; t, –0.86; P = .39).
Additional MLMs were run to test for effects of P-SA-
MDD symptom score over time in specific regions of the brain
(eAppendix 2 in the Supplement). There were no significant
interactions of P-SA-MDD symptom score with time after cor-
rection for multiple comparisons. Effect sizes were calcu-
lated by taking the correlation of P-SA-MDD symptoms score
with participants’individual slope estimates. Effect sizes for
all regions tested are in eTable 5 in the Supplement.
Discussion
These longitudinal findings demonstrate marked bilateral de-
creases in thickness of cortical gray matter and in volume of
the right hemisphere (with marginal significance on the left
hemisphere) associated with mean level of depression symp-
tom scores and MDD diagnosis experienced from preschool to
school age. Children with depression symptom scores 2 SDs
above the mean had reduction in volumes of gray matter at al-
most twice the rate of those with no childhood depression
symptoms. Similarly, cortical thickness also decreased more
rapidly at almost the same rate. To our knowledge, these find-
ings provide the first longitudinal neuroimaging data show-
ing increases in rates of volume reduction and cortical thin-
ningrelatedtonumberofchildhooddepressionsymptomsand
diagnosis during the preschool-age to school-age period.
The absence of lateralized findings for thickness and the
marginally significant finding on the left hemisphere for vol-
ume is notable given that much of the extant literature on MDD
has discussed the right hemisphere.9,41,42 In addition, the lack
of specific findings in regions that regulate the emotions is also
notable given that these more specific volume reductions have
been reported in depression.16,43-46 These more global find-
ings in children suggest a relatively generalized process that
maybeoperativeatearlierdevelopmentalstages.Whilewedid
see thinning in some candidate regions, none survived mul-
tiplecomparisoncorrection.Thewhole-braineffectslikelyarise
from the aggregation of thinning across several regions. Such
global volumetric and thickness alterations are also consis-
tent with reports of large-scale structural network anomalies
of gray matter in depressed adults.47 Furthermore, signifi-
cant effects of sex and ratio of income to needs on the trajec-
tory of volume and thickness of cortical gray matter were also
found and are worthy of further follow-up. The finding of dif-
ferences in thickness and volume without differences in sur-
face area has been reported in several neuropsychiatric
conditions.48,49
The study findings from this population enriched for early
childhood depression and followed up into middle childhood
and early adolescence provide the first data, to our knowl-
edge, demonstrating depression-related alterations in vol-
ume and thickness of cortical gray matter evident as early as
middlechildhood.Thesefindingsaddtoagrowingbodyofneu-
roimaging data in children and adolescents with depression

The study findings provide support for the notion that corti-
cal thinning evident in depression begins in childhood, as
speculated by Peterson et al.9 A limitation of the study is that
it was not possible to separate developmental timing effects.
Future studies designed to compare patients with early child-
hood depression during the preschool period vs those with-
out preschool depression with onset of depression at school
age are needed to clarify whether there are effects of timing
of childhood depression on brain change.

We speculate that changes in cortical gray matter related
to childhood depression may reflect experience-dependent
neuroplasticity. However, the study was not designed to de-
finitively inform whether the cortical changes were related to
depression-basedexperience-dependentplasticityvsotherge-
netic or psychosocial processes. Nonetheless, the current find-
ingsareconsistentwithanexperience-dependentprocessgiven
the fact that a family history of depression, a putative marker
of family genetic risk, was not related to trajectories of corti-
calgraymatter.Furthermore,thefindingthatdimensionaland
categoricalmeasuresofMDDaswellasratioofincometoneeds
predicted cortical change, and that the experience of stress-
ful and traumatic life events during this same period was not
related to cortical change, suggests that the finding may be
more specifically related to certain types of negative experi-
enceratherthanamoregeneraleffectofstressfulevents.While
an experimental design with neuroimaging prior to depres-
sionwouldbeneededtotestthishypothesis,thefindingshigh-
light the potential unique importance of the experience of
childhood depression in the developmental trajectory of cor-
tical gray matter.
The functional and depression-specific clinical implica-
tions of the increased rate of volume reduction and thinning
of the cerebral cortex found in this study are not clear from
these data. Such alterations in other psychiatric disorders have
beeninterpretedasacceleratedmaturation,whichmaybeseen
as maladaptive given that pruning may be strongly informed
by early negative disorder-related experience rather than more
developmentally normative positive experiences later. Fur-
thermore, our study cannot inform the cellular processes that
underlie the alterations in gray matter development and
whether they are related to increased rates of myelination
and/orcelllossowingtopruning.30,31Inaddition,sincetheneu-
roimaging scans began after the cortical peak, it is not pos-
sible to determine whether early or premature and/or accel-
erated pruning is taking place.
Conclusions
Of critical importance is that childhood depressive symp-
toms were associated with decline in volume and thickness
of cortical gray matter even after accounting for other key
factors known to affect this developmental process. These
findings of markedly increased rates of cortical volume loss
and thinning across the entire cortex underscore the impor-
tance of attention to childhood depression as a marker of
altered childhood cortical brain development. Whether
these early alterations serve as an endophenotype of risk for
later depressive episodes or chronic course is a question of
interest as the study sample is followed up through adoles-
cence. The study findings signal the need for greater public
health attention and screening for depression in young
children.52
