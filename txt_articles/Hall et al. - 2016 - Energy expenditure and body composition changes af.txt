ABSTRACT
Background: The carbohydrate–insulin model of obesity posits
that habitual consumption of a high-carbohydrate diet sequesters
fat within adipose tissue because of hyperinsulinemia and results
in adaptive suppression of energy expenditure (EE). Therefore,
isocaloric exchange of dietary carbohydrate for fat is predicted to
result in increased EE, increased fat oxidation, and loss of body fat.
In contrast, a more conventional view that “a calorie is a calorie”
predicts that isocaloric variations in dietary carbohydrate and fat
will have no physiologically important effects on EE or body fat.
Objective: We investigated whether an isocaloric low-carbohydrate
ketogenic diet (KD) is associated with changes in EE, respiratory
quotient (RQ), and body composition.
Design: Seventeen overweight or obese men were admitted to met-
abolic wards, where they consumed a high-carbohydrate baseline diet
(BD) for 4 wk followed by 4 wk of an isocaloric KD with clamped
protein. Subjects spent 2 consecutive days each week residing in met-
abolic chambers to measure changes in EE (EEchamber), sleeping EE
(SEE), and RQ. Body composition changes were measured by dual-
energy X-ray absorptiometry. Average EE during the final 2 wk of the
BD and KD periods was measured by doubly labeled water (EEDLW).
Results: Subjects lost weight and body fat throughout the study
corresponding to an overall negative energy balance of w300
kcal/d. Compared with BD, the KD coincided with increased
EEchamber (57 6 13 kcal/d, P = 0.0004) and SEE (89 6 14 kcal/d,
P , 0.0001) and decreased RQ (20.111 6 0.003, P , 0.0001). EEDLW
increased by 151 6 63 kcal/d (P = 0.03). Body fat loss slowed
during the KD and coincided with increased protein utilization and
loss of fat-free mass.
Conclusion: The isocaloric KD was not accompanied by increased
body fat loss but was associated with relatively small increases in
EE that were near the limits of detection with the use of state-of-
the-art technology. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT01967563.

INTRODUCTION
Dietary carbohydrates and insulin have been suggested to
play causal roles in the pathological accumulation of body fat
(1–4). According to this carbohydrate–insulin model of obesity,
an increased proportion of the diet as carbohydrates results in el-
evated insulin secretion that suppresses the release of fatty acids
into circulation and directs circulating fat toward storage. Ad-
ditionally, the decreased availability of fatty acids for use by
metabolically active tissues, such as heart, muscle, and liver, is
perceived as a state of cellular internal starvation, possibly
through an increased ratio of cellular AMP to ATP (4), leading
to an adaptive decrease in energy expenditure (EE)7 and an in-
crease in food intake (1, 4–7). Therefore, the positive energy
balance associated with development of obesity is hypothesized
to be a consequence of the insulin-driven shift in fat partitioning
toward storage and away from oxidation resulting from an in-
creased proportion of dietary carbohydrates.
A logical consequence of the carbohydrate–insulin model is
that decreasing the proportion of dietary carbohydrate to fat
without altering protein or calories will reduce insulin secretion,
increase fat mobilization from adipose tissue, and elevate the

 oxidation of circulating free fatty acids (FFAs). The altered
metabolic and endocrine milieu is therefore predicted to relieve
the state of cellular internal starvation resulting in decreased
hunger, increased body fat loss, and increased EE. In contrast,
a more conventional model asserts that a calorie is a calorie,
meaning that isocaloric exchanges between dietary carbohydrate
and fat will not substantially influence EE or body fat (8).
Testing these competing model predictions is challenging
because outpatient diet studies are typically associated with poor
adherence, even when all study foods are provided (9). We aimed
to avoid this difficulty by confining study volunteers to metabolic
wards where they consumed, under supervision, a 4-wk run-in
high-carbohydrate baseline diet (BD) followed by an isocaloric
low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) for another 4 wk. Our
prespecified primary endpoints were changes in total EE
(EEchamber), sleeping EE (SEE), and 24-h respiratory quotient
(RQ) measured by using metabolic chambers. Body composition
changes were prespecified secondary endpoints of the study.
METHODS
Study protocol
Figure 1 depicts a summary of the study design in which
subjects were admitted to metabolic wards and consumed a BD
(Table 1) for a 4-wk run-in period (days 228 to 0) followed by
a KD (Table 1) for another 4 wk (days 1–28). The study protocol
was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Na-
tional Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
(NCT01967563), the Pennington Biomedical Research Center
(2013-3-PBRC), Columbia University Medical Center (IRB-
AAAL7113), and the Translational Research Institute for Me-
tabolism and Diabetes (IRB 493675).
Seventeen men between the ages of 18 and 50 y with a BMI
(kg/m2) between 25 and 35 provided informed consent and were
admitted to metabolic wards (5 subjects at NIH, and 4 subjects
at each of the other sites). Participants were excluded if they
were not weight stable (weight change of .5% in the past 6 mo),
were ,92% of lifetime maximum weight, had blood pressure
.140/90 mm Hg, were unable to complete daily bouts of sta-
tionary cycling, had evidence of diseases that affect metabolism
or eating disorders, were taking medications interfering with
study outcomes, or were unwilling or unable to eat the foods
provided in the study. We also excluded subjects whose habitual
diets were ,30% or .65% of total calories from carbohydrate as
determined by a food-frequency questionnaire.
Subjects were invited to participate in 3 screening visits
designed to ensure acceptability and adherence to the study diets
and procedures, assess potential social or psychological barriers
to the completion of the study, complete a medical history and
physical examination, answer several questionnaires, measure
resting EE, and personalize the intensity of the prescribed daily
stationary cycling that was subsequently clamped for the study
duration. Subjects were prescribed 90 min of daily stationary
cycling, and overall physical activity was quantified with small,
portable, pager-type accelerometers (GT3XE+, Actigraph Cor-
poration) sampled at 80 Hz.
We required that the average EEchamber measured during the
last pair of chamber days during the BD period to be within 5%
of the average EEchamber measured the previous week. In 2 cases,
this criterion was not met, and an additional week of BD was
required to ensure stability of EEchamber before initiating the KD
period. All but one of the sites had the metabolic chambers
colocated with the metabolic ward. At one site the subjects were

designed to represent a habitual high-carbohydrate intake for a 28-d run-in
period followed by an isocaloric KD for an additional 28 d. Dietary protein
was kept constant throughout, and the subjects were prescribed 90 min of
low-intensity daily aerobic exercise. Every week, subjects spent 2 consecu-
tive days residing in metabolic chambers to measure total daily energy
expenditure, respiratory quotient, and sleeping energy expenditure. Body
composition was measured by DXA, and the average energy expenditure
during the last 2 wk of each diet period was measured by the DLW method.

Diets
The 7-d rotating menus were designed to match the macro-
nutrient targets of a habitual BD and a KD by using NUTRI-
TIONIST PRO software version 1.3 (First Databank Inc.; The
Hearst Corporation). The energy and macronutrient composition
for each day of both the BD and KD menus was verified by
chemical analysis (Covance Laboratories). Most of the food was
prepared at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center meta-
bolic kitchen, frozen, and shipped to the study sites, where fresh
produce was added and the meals were prepared for consumption
according to standardized procedures. Both the BD and KD
menus contained minimal quantities of processed food, and,
despite the large differences in macronutrient composition and
sugar content, the BD did not include large quantities of added or
liquid sugars. In that regard, the BD may have differed somewhat
from the customary diets of these subjects. Sample menus for 1 d
of each diet are included in the Supplemental Materials.
The energy intake was determined weekly for each subject
during the initial BD period by using the average EEchamber for
the previous week and rounding upward to the nearest 50 kcal.
Energy intake adjustments were permitted until day 29 of the
BD period to match EEchamber, but adjustments after day 215
were unnecessary, and energy intake was subsequently clamped
for the remainder of the study.
Table 1 presents the 7-d average diet compositions during the
isocaloric BD and KD periods. The macronutrient proportions
determined by chemical analyses were consistent with the
values calculated by the nutrient analysis software used to
design the diets. The software allowed for a more detailed
breakdown of the diet composition and showed that the BD
derived w25% of total calories from sugars, whereas the KD
had ,2% from sugars.
All subjects were confined to the metabolic ward throughout
the study with no access to outside food. Subjects knew that it was
imperative that they eat all of the food provided. If they were not
able to eat a study food, they were instructed to notify the study
dietitian immediately so that other arrangements could be con-
sidered. Dietitians and health technicians met with the subjects
regularly to discuss the diet and assess compliance. Visitors were
allowed to meet with study subjects in a common area under
observation of the nursing and/or research staff to avoid the
exchange of food or beverages. Meals were consumed in a com-
mon area under observation of the research staff, and participants
were not allowed to leave the table during the meals. All meal trays
were checked after consumption, and any food that was not
consumed was weighed and subsequent meals were adjusted for
previously uneaten food.
EE via metabolic chamber
All chamber measurement periods were .23 h, and we
extrapolated the data to represent 24-h periods by assuming
that the mean of the measured periods was representative of the
24-h period. See the Supplemental Materials for a detailed
derivation of the indirect calorimetry equations and their pa-
rameterization (Supplemental Table 1) for both the BD and
KD periods.
During the BD period, the EE was calculated as shown in
Equation 1:
EEchamberðkcalÞ ¼ 3:88 3 V O2ðLÞ
þ 1:08 3 V CO2ðLÞ 2 1:57 3 NðgÞ
ð1Þ
where VO2 and VCO2 were the volumes of oxygen consumed
and carbon dioxide produced, respectively, and N was the 24-h
urinary nitrogen excretion measured by chemiluminescence
(Antek MultiTek Analyzer; PAC).
Indirect calorimetry calculations are affected by the end
products of protein oxidation (10). Interestingly, unlike pro-
longed fasting, in which the ratio of nitrogen contained in urea
plus creatinine to ammonia can decrease substantially from the
standard ratio of 95:5, neither the BD (P = 0.08) nor the KD (P =
0.85) deviated significantly from this standard ratio.
During the KD period, the equations were adjusted as shown in
Equation 2 to account for urinary ketone excretion, Kexcr:
EEchamberðkcalÞ ¼ 3:88 3 ½V O2ðLÞ 2 0:32ðL=gÞ 3 KexcrðgÞ�
þ 1:08 3 V CO2ðLÞ 2 1:57 3 NðgÞ
þ 1:39 3 KexcrðgÞ
ð2Þ
SEE was determined by the lowest EE over a continuous 180-min
period between the hours of 0000 and 0600 (11). Other compo-
nents of EE, including energy cost of cycling exercise at
a clamped intensity (EEexercise), EE when not moving (EEsedentary),
physical activity expenditure on days inside the metabolic cham-
ber (PAEchamber), spontaneous physical activity inside the meta-
bolic chamber (SPA), and awake and fed thermogenesis (AFT),
were defined as described in the Supplemental Materials and
Supplemental Figures 1 and 2. The procedures used to adjust
the primary EE data for measured changes in body weight and
composition are also described in the Supplemental Materials.
EE via doubly labeled water
Subjects drank from a stock solution of 2H2O and H2
18O water
in which 1 g 2H2O (99.99% enrichment) was mixed with 19 g
H2
18O (10% enrichment). An aliquot of the stock solution was
saved for dilution to be analyzed along with each set of urine
samples. The water was weighed to the nearest 0.1 g into the
dosing container. The prescribed dose was 1.0 g/kg body weight,
and the actual dose amounts were entered in the dose log. Spot
urine samples were collected daily. Isotopic enrichments of
urine samples were measured by isotope ratio mass spectrom-
etry. The average CO2 production rate (rCO2) can be estimated
from the rate constants describing the exponential disappearance
of the labeled 18O and D water isotopes (kO and kD) in repeated
spot urine samples collected over several days and were cor-
rected for previous isotope doses. We used the parameters of
Racette et al. (12) with the weighted dilution space calculation,
Rdil, proposed by Speakman (13) as shown in Equation 3:
rCO2 ¼ ðN=2:078Þð1:007kO 2 1:007RdilkDÞ 2 0:0246rGF

 The Supplemental Materials provide a detailed derivation of

PAEchamber is known to be less than physical activity expenditure
on days outside the metabolic chamber (PAEnonchamber)(14) and
presumably accounts for the main difference between EEDLW
and EEchamber. We quantified the physical activity EE on non-
chamber days as shown in Equation 6:

where EEsedentary was calculated as the average daily chamber

Anthropometry and body composition
Body weight and height were measured to the nearest 0.1 kg
and 0.1 cm, respectively, with subjects wearing a hospital gown
and undergarments and after an overnight fast. Body fat was
measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
scanners (Lunar iDXA; GE Healthcare).
Blood and urine measurements
See Supplemental Table 2 for the description of the methods
and assay statistics for the various blood and urine measurements.
Because acetoacetate could be lost from the urine as a result of
non-enzymatic decarboxylation to acetone, it is possible that
ketone excretion may have been underestimated because of
acetone evaporation from the 24-h urine collection containers. If
a substantial amount of acetoacetate had been lost from the urine
samples, then the acetoacetate fraction of total ketones would be
decreased in urine compared with the blood. This did not happen.
Rather, the urine acetoacetate fraction was 62% 6 3%, which
was slightly higher than the blood fraction, which was 50% 6 2%
(P = 0.004). Furthermore, the measured urinary ketone excretion
was commensurate with the circulating ketone concentrations
(15), suggesting that the measured total ketone excretion was not
severely affected by loss of acetoacetate.
Statistical analyses
This study was powered to detect a change in EEchamber $150
kcal/d between the BD and KD periods in 16 subjects by using
an endpoint analysis with probability (power) of 0.93 assuming
a 120-kcal/d SD in EEchamber (16) and a type I error probability
of 0.05. We chose the 150-kcal/d effect size because this was the
smallest change in EEchamber that was considered physiologi-
cally important.
Statistical analyses were performed with the use of SAS
version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc.). The data tables present least
squares means 6 SEs and were analyzed by using a repeated-
measures mixed model with a covariance structure of compound
symmetry (PROC MIXED; SAS). We also tested a first-order
autoregressive covariance pattern, and the results were un-
changed. Study site was not a significant determinant when in-
cluded in the mixed model, and its inclusion had no significant
effect on the primary endpoints. Data are therefore reported
without adjusting for study site. Missing data were not imputed
because the repeated-measures mixed-model procedure is robust
to data missing at random (17). The figures depict means 6 95%
CIs at each time point, and 2-sided t tests were used to compare
changes with respect to the day 0 BD. Outliers were identified
by Cook’s distance with a cutoff of 4/n, where n is the number of
observations. Outlier data points were excluded from the anal-
yses and treated as missing data. Statistical significance was
declared at P , 0.05 for 2-sided tests, and comparisons de-
picted in the figures were Bonferroni-adjusted for multiple
comparisons.
RESULTS
Subjects and compliance
Seventeen men (10 black or African American, 5 white, 1
Asian, and 1 Hispanic) successfully completed the screening
phase of the study (see Supplemental Figure 3 for the study
flow diagram). The subjects were mean 6 SE age 33 6 1.8 y,
weighed 87.4 6 3.7 kg, and had a BMI of 28.8 6 0.8, and
their percent body fat measured on day 215 was 28.9% 6
1.1%.
The diets were well tolerated, and all of the study food was
consumed at each meal. Compliance with the daily prescribed
cycling exercise was excellent in all but 3 subjects whose
accelerometry data indicated that they sometimes failed to
perform the exercise on non-chamber days.
Body weight and composition changes
The subjects lost 0.8 6 0.2 kg (P = 0.002) of body weight
over the last 15 d of the BD period (Figure 2A) with 0.5 6
0.1 kg (P = 0.005) of this unintentional weight loss coming from
body fat (Figure 2B). One subject had a body fat mass mea-
surement at day 0 that was .2 kg less than the measurement at
day 215, despite losing ,0.5 kg of body weight. This was
a clear outlier [Cook’s distance = 0.1 . 4/(17 subjects 3 4
observations/subject) = 0.06], and the subject was excluded from
the analysis of fat mass changes.
The body weight and composition changes indicated an
overall state of negative energy balance that was calculated to be
2373 6 97 kcal/d (P = 0.002) by using standard coefficients for
the energy densities of body fat and fat-free mass (18) as shown
in Figure 2C. Introduction of the KD was followed by a rapid
additional 1.6 6 0.2 kg of weight loss (P , 0.0001), likely
primarily the result of body water loss because fat mass

 decreased by only 0.2 6 0.1 kg (P = 0.09) over the next 15 d.
Over the entire 28-d KD period, the total weight lost was 2.2 6
0.3 kg (P , 0.0001), with 0.5 6 0.2 kg (P = 0.03) from loss of
body fat. The energy imbalance during the last 2 wk of the KD
was calculated to be 2242 6 94 kcal/d (P = 0.02; Figure 2C)
and was not significantly different from the last 2 wk of the BD
period (P = 0.33).
EE and RQ
Because of chamber malfunctions, 1 subject had missing
chamber data on days 28 and 27, and 2 other subjects had
missing chamber data on days 11 and 12. All other data points
from these subjects were retained in the analyses. EEDLW from
one subject was a clear outlier [Cook’s distance = 0.4 . 4/(17
subjects 3 2 observations/subject) = 0.29] such that, despite
gaining 0.2 kg of weight during the KD period, EEDLW
was .1000 kcal/d greater than both energy intake and the
EEDLW measured during BD. This was not the same subject who
was an outlier for the body fat mass changes described above.
Table 2 shows that EEchamber during the last 2 wk of the BD
period was 2619 6 93 kcal/d, which was slightly less than en-
ergy intake (2739 6 108 kcal/d; P , 0.0001). EEDLW during the
last 2 wk of the BD period (including the 4 d spent in the
metabolic chamber) was 2995 6 45 kcal/d, which was signifi-
cantly greater than both EEchamber (P = 0.0005) and energy in-
take (P = 0.005). Therefore, the doubly labeled water data
confirmed a state of overall negative energy balance of 2251 6
84 kcal/d (Figure 2C) and was not significantly different from
the value calculated by using the body composition changes (P =
0.42). The negative energy balance was likely due to increased
physical activity on the nonchamber days as indicated by a
FIGURE 2
Body composition and overall energy balance. Subjects
experienced an unintentional loss of (A) body weight (A) and (B) fat mass
(h) throughout the study, indicating an overall state of negative energy
balance. Weight loss was accelerated during the first 2 wk of the KD, but
the rate of body fat loss slowed during this period. During the final 2 wk of
the KD, both the rates of body weight and fat loss were similar to baseline.
(C) The calculated negative energy balance during the last 2 wk of the
baseline period (BD 215 to 0 d) and the KD period (15–28 d) was not
significantly different whether assessed by the measured body composition
changes (DXA; n = 16) or by calculating energy intake minus expenditure
as measured by DLW (n = 16). Horizontal solid lines indicate significant
weight changes from the final BD day, P , 0.0012 as assessed by a paired,

 21% 6 4% increase in hip accelerometer counts during the
nonchamber days (P = 0.0002).
Table 2 shows that EEchamber during the KD phase was 2676 6
93 kcal/d and was 57 6 13 kcal/d greater than during the
baseline period (P = 0.0004). Because EE is known to be pro-
portional to body weight and even more strongly related to fat-
free mass (19), we adjusted EEchamber for the observed weight
and body composition changes as described in the Supplemental
Materials. The weight-adjusted EEchamber was 88 6 13 kcal/d
greater during the KD period than during the BD period (Table
2; P , 0.0001). Adjusting the EEchamber data for body compo-
sition changes resulted in the KD period having 96 6 12 kcal/d
greater expenditure than the BD period (Table 2; P , 0.0001).
The time course of the unadjusted EEchamber changes is de-
picted in Figure 3A, illustrating that there was no significant
linear trend over time during the BD period (P = 0.76), and
introduction of the KD coincided with an increase in EE by
w100 kcal/d in the first week, after which there was a significant
linear decrease over time (P = 0.002). The waning of EEchamber
during the KD persisted after adjustment for changes in body
weight (P = 0.027) and body composition (P = 0.021).
SEE extrapolated to the entire day was 1569 6 63 kcal/d
during the baseline period and significantly increased by 89 6
14 kcal/d during the KD (Table 2; P , 0.0001). Adjusting the
SEE data for the measured body weight changes (see Supple-
mental Materials) resulted in a total increase of 111 6 13 kcal/d
(Table 2; P , 0.0001) during the KD relative to the BD.
Adjusting for body composition changes resulted in a total SEE
increase of 121 6 13 kcal/d (Table 2; P , 0.0001) during the
KD.
Figure 3B shows the time course of the unadjusted SEE
changes, which were stable during the BD period (P = 0.93
testing for a linear trend in time), significantly increased by
w200 kcal/d within the first week of the KD, and then waned
linearly over time (P , 0.0001). The decline of SEE during the
KD persisted after adjustment for changes in body weight (P ,
0.0001) and body composition (P , 0.0001).
We also explored other components of EE measured during the
chamber stays as described in the Supplemental Materials, in-
cluding the EEexercise, EEsedentary, SPA, PAEchamber, and AFT,
which is the thermic effect of food plus the energy expended
above SEE as a result of being awake (20). Table 2 shows that
PAEchamber and SPA decreased during the KD, whereas EEexercise
and AFT were unchanged and EEsedentary increased.
Table 2 and Figure 3C show that the 24-h RQ decreased
significantly from 0.879 6 0.007 during the BD period to
0.775 6 0.006 at the start of the KD period (P , 0.0001) and
remained approximately constant until the end of the study,
indicating a rapid and persistent increase in fat oxidation. The
changes in 24-h RQ were similar to the changes in daily food
quotient calculated by chemical analysis of the diet.
EEDLW was 3146 6 45 kcal/d during the KD, which was
151 6 63 kcal/d greater than during the BD period (Table 2; P =
0.03). Although this apparent increase in EEDLW during the
KD was likely accounted for by an increase in physical activity
on days outside the metabolic chamber, Table 2 shows that
PAEnonchamber did not significantly increase during the KD com-
pared with during the BD (126 6 93 kcal/d; P = 0.2). Physical
activity expenditure was 514 6 107 kcal/d greater on the days
outside the chamber during the baseline diet (P = 0.0002) and
was 696 6 172 kcal/d greater during the KD (P = 0.0011).
However, there was no significant difference between the diets
(P = 0.083).
The energy imbalance calculated by subtracting EEDLW
from energy intake was not significantly different from that
calculated by using the body composition changes during
either the BD (P = 0.42) or the KD (P = 0.29) (Figure 2C).
However, the calculated energy imbalance measured by using
the doubly labeled water method was 182 6 66 kcal/d more
negative during the KD period than during the BD (P = 0.015
for a simple pairwise comparison between diets). However,

 this difference in energy imbalance between diet periods
calculated by DLW should be interpreted with caution since
these exploratory endpoints were also subject to multiple
comparisons with the DXA determined energy imbalances
during both diet periods.
24-h urinary excretion
Daily insulin secretion, as estimated by 24-h urinary C-peptide
excretion, rapidly and persistently decreased by 47% 6 3% after
the introduction of the KD (Table 3; P , 0.0001). Total urinary
ketone excretion increased .10-fold (Table 3; P , 0.0001) but
amounted to ,15 kcal/d of excreted energy.
Urinary nitrogen excretion increased by 1.5 6 0.4 g/d (Table
3; P = 0.0008) during the KD phase and indicated significantly
increased protein utilization. The time course of the changes in
urinary nitrogen excretion showed that the increased protein
utilization occurred within the first week of the KD and persisted
until day 11 (not shown). Excretion of both urea and ammonia
significantly increased during the KD, whereas creatinine ex-
cretion was unchanged (Table 3). Norepinephrine excretion
significantly decreased during the KD period and adrenaline
excretion also tended to decrease (P = 0.07), indicating de-
creased sympathetic tone.
Overnight fasted plasma metabolite and hormone

Figure 4 shows the changes in plasma ketones (i.e., the sum of
acetoacetate and b-hydroxybutyrate), FFAs, glucose, glycerol,
and triglycerides in the overnight fasted state. After the KD,
there was an increased availability of circulating ketones and
FFAs, a trend towards decreased triglycerides, no significant
changes in circulating glucose or glycerol, and no significant
change in overall circulating energy. Table 4 presents the
overnight fasted plasma concentrations during the BD and KD
periods. One subject had plasma insulin and C-peptide values

 that were abnormally high at the final time point and were clear
outliers [Cook’s distance for insulin = 0.29 and Cook’s distance
for C-peptide = 0.27, both of which are greater than the
threshold 4/(17 subjects 3 5 observations/subject) = 0.046];
these data were excluded. As expected, the KD was associated
with significant increases in ketones, FFAs, and glycerol. Fasting
glucose was not significantly different between the diets, whereas
glucagon significantly increased and C-peptide, insulin, and
triglycerides significantly decreased during the KD. Leptin
was significantly decreased during the KD period. Thyroid-
stimulating hormone and free thyroxine concentrations were
significantly increased during the KD phase, whereas both free
and total tri-iodothyronine were significantly decreased.
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrated that transitioning from the BD to the
KD coincided with a substantial decrease in daily insulin se-
cretion and 24-h RQ, increased circulating FFA and ketones, and
marginal increases in EEchamber and SEE. These data, although
somewhat confounded by ongoing weight loss, suggest that
large isocaloric changes in the proportion of dietary carbohy-
drate to fat transiently increase EE by only w100 kcal/d after
adjusting for body weight and composition. Furthermore, the
body weight and composition adjustments likely overestimated
the EE changes during the KD because much of the weight loss
was likely from water rather than loss of metabolically active
tissues.
Our study adds to the literature addressing the perennial
question: is a calorie a calorie? A conventional view is that the
proportion of carbohydrate to fat in the diet has a physiologi-
cally negligible effect on EE when dietary protein and energy
intake are held constant (8). In contrast, the carbohydrate–
insulin model predicts that the KD would lead to increased EE,
thereby resulting in a metabolic advantage amounting to w300–
600 kcal/d (21, 22). Our data do not support EE increases of that
magnitude.
Several controlled feeding studies have demonstrated signif-
icant differences in EE between isocaloric diets with differences
in dietary protein (23–25). Unless accompanied by an increase in
dietary protein (22, 26), carbohydrate restriction has not pre-
viously been observed to increase EE. Rather, studies that use
clamped dietary protein and varying carbohydrates from 20% to
75% of total calories have found either small decreases in EE
with lower-carbohydrate diets (16, 27–30) or no statistically
significant differences (22, 24, 31–38). Mathematical model
simulations predicted that cutting dietary carbohydrates to very
low amounts would reverse this trend and lead to slightly in-
creased EE (16). This prediction appears to have been borne
out in our data, where we observed small increases in SEE,
EEchamber, and EEDLW with a KD in which dietary carbohydrate
was cut to 5% and protein was clamped at 15% of total calories.
The rapid increase in SEE and EEchamber within the first week
of the KD may have been caused by increased hepatic oxygen
consumption proportional to the rate of ketogenesis (39). For
ketogenesis to fully explain the observed early w200-kcal/d in-
crease in SEE requires w150 g/d of ketogenesis (16), which is
commensurate with both the observed circulating ketone con-
centrations as well as the urinary excretion rate, and implies
a rate of ketogenesis approximately half of that achieved within
1 wk of fasting when ketogenesis reaches a maximum (15). The
KD likely also increased the flux through the energy-requiring
gluconeogenic pathway as well as the triglyceride fatty acid cycle,
both of which would be expected to slightly increase EE (26,
40). EE may have decreased subsequently as gluconeogenesis
declined with the brain shifting away from glucose toward ke-
tone oxidation (15, 41, 42). Decreased insulin secretion per se
may also result in an adaptive suppression of EE (43). Fur-
thermore, the overall state of negative energy balance, decreased
circulating concentrations of thyroid hormones, and decreased
24-h catecholamine secretion all favor decreased EE.
Although the primary EE endpoints determined by the met-
abolic chamber indicated small transient increases during the KD
period amounting to ,100 kcal/d, the exploratory EEDLW end-
point increased by w150 kcal/d. Because physical activity
typically increases on days outside the metabolic chamber (14),
EEDLW was greater than EEchamber, and any additional increment
in EE detected by EEDLW during the KD must be explained by
differences in PAEnonchamber. Indeed, PAEnonchamber during the
KD increased by w130 kcal/d compared with BD, but this was
not statistically significant. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the
possibility that a KD might increase physical activity in free-
living subjects and that we failed to observe this effect because
the subjects’ physical activities were limited by the metabolic
ward setting.
The carbohydrate–insulin model predicts a greater rate of
body fat loss during the KD period. Our data do not support this
prediction because body fat loss slowed on transition to the KD,
possibly because of augmented utilization of body protein, as
indicated by the increased urinary nitrogen excretion that per-
sisted until day 11 of the KD period. The rate of fat loss during
the final 2 wk of the KD was similar to that of the baseline
period. We suspect that the increased dietary fat resulted in

 elevated circulating postprandial triglyceride concentrations
throughout the day, which may have stimulated adipose tissue
fat uptake (44) and/or inhibited adipocyte lipolysis (45, 46).
These mechanistic questions deserve further study, but it is clear
that regulation of adipose tissue fat storage is multifaceted and
that insulin does not always play a predominant role (16).
A major limitation of our study is the unintentional weight
loss. Despite slight positive energy balance during the chamber
days, the overall negative energy balance amounted to w300
kcal/d and was likely due to greater spontaneous physical ac-
tivity on nonchamber days. This occurred despite confining the
subjects to metabolic wards and our best efforts to maintain
constant activity levels by prescribing 90 min of fixed intensity
stationary cycling exercise every day. Nevertheless, similar to
a previous metabolic ward study (14), physical activity on
nonchamber days was substantially greater than on chamber
days.
In addition to the lack of weight maintenance, there are other
limitations of our study. We did not measure fecal energy content,
which may have differed between the diets. We did not include
a control group that did not receive the KD or a group that had the
diets delivered in the reverse order. Therefore, although the
timing of the observed changes in EEchamber, SEE, and 24-h RQ
are highly suggestive, we cannot definitively claim that the KD
per se was the cause. Nor do our observations necessarily
translate to women or men classified as normal weight or un-
derweight or having class II obesity or above.
In summary, we found that a carefully controlled isocaloric KD
coincided with small increases in EE that waned over time.
Despite rapid, substantial, and persistent reductions in daily
insulin secretion and RQ after introducing the KD, we observed
a slowing of body fat loss. Therefore, our data do not support the
carbohydrate–insulin model predictions of physiologically rel-
evant increases in EE or greater body fat loss in response to an
isocaloric KD. However, it is possible that dietary carbohydrate
restriction might result in decreased ad libitum energy intake—
a prediction of the carbohydrate-insulin model that was not
tested in the current study but deserves further investigation.
