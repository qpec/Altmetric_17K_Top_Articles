ABSTRACT
The rapid increase of carbapenem resistance in Gram-negative bacteria
has resurrected the importance of the polymyxin antibiotics. The recent discovery of
plasmid-mediated polymyxin resistance (mcr-1) in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacte-
riaceae serves as an important indicator that the golden era of antibiotics is under
serious threat. We assessed the bacterial killing of 15 different FDA-approved antibi-
otics alone and in combination with polymyxin B in time-killing experiments against
Escherichia coli MCR1_NJ, the first reported isolate in the United States to coharbor
mcr-1 and a New Delhi metallo-�-lactamase gene (blaNDM-5). The most promising
regimens were advanced to the hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM), where human
pharmacokinetics for polymyxin B, aztreonam, and amikacin were simulated over
240 h. Exposure to polymyxin B monotherapy was accompanied by MCR1_NJ re-
growth but not resistance amplification (polymyxin B MIC from 0 to 240 h [MIC0h to
MIC240h] of 4 mg/liter), whereas amikacin monotherapy caused regrowth and simul-
taneous resistance amplification (amikacin MIC0h of 4 mg/liter versus MIC240h of �64
mg/liter). No MCR1_NJ colonies were observed for any of the aztreonam-containing
regimens after 72 h. However, HFIM cartridges for both aztreonam monotherapy
and the polymyxin B-plus-aztreonam regimen were remarkably turbid, and the pres-
ence of long, filamentous MCR1_NJ cells was evident in scanning electron microscopy,
suggestive of a nonreplicating persister (NRP) phenotype. In contrast, the 3-drug combi-
nation of polymyxin B, aztreonam, and amikacin provided complete eradication (�8-
log10 CFU/ml reduction) with suppression of resistance and prevention of NRP forma-
tion. This is the first comprehensive pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study to
evaluate triple-drug combinations for polymyxin- and carbapenem-resistant E. coli copro-
ducing MCR-1 and NDM-5 and will aid in the preparation for a so-called “
postantibiotic”
era.
IMPORTANCE
A global health crisis may be on the horizon, as the golden era of
antibiotics is under serious threat. We recently reported the first case in the United
States of a highly resistant, Escherichia coli so-called “superbug” (MCR1_NJ), cohar-
boring two of the most worrying antibiotic resistance genes, encoding mobile colis-
tin resistance (mcr-1) and a New Delhi metallo-�-lactamase (blaNDM-5). Worryingly,
the medical community is vulnerable to this emerging bacterial threat because opti-
mal treatment strategies are undefined. Here, we report the activity of an optimized

 combination using simulated human doses of commercially available antibiotics
against MCR1_NJ. A unique triple combination involving a cocktail of polymyxin B,
aztreonam, and amikacin eradicated the MCR-1- and NDM-5-producing E. coli. Each
antimicrobial agent administered as monotherapy or in double combinations failed
to eradicate MCR1_NJ at a high inoculum. To our knowledge, this is the first study
to propose 3-drug therapeutic solutions against superbugs coharboring mcr-1 and
blaNDM, seeking to prepare clinicians for future occurrences of these pathogens.

arbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) pose an urgent threat to global
human health. Among the enzymes responsible for carbapenem resistance, the
New Delhi metallo-�-lactamases (NDM) warrant significant attention due to their
location on highly mobile genetic elements and coexistence with many other resis-
tance determinants that have resulted in their rapid worldwide dissemination. The
polymyxin antibiotics (polymyxin B and polymyxin E [colistin]) have resurged as im-
portant last-line treatment options against CRE. The World Health Organization has also
reclassified the polymyxin antibiotics as being “critically important to human medicine,”
highlighting the need to optimize their clinical use (1). Therefore, the recent discovery
of the plasmid-mediated, mobile polymyxin resistance gene mcr-1 poses a significant
threat to the clinician’
s treatment armamentarium.
MCR-1-producing Escherichia coli was first discovered in 2015 in China (2) and has
now been detected in the United States and worldwide (3). MCR-1 is a phosphoetha-
nolamine transferase capable of modifying the lipid A portion of lipopolysaccharide
with phosphoethanolamine, thereby inhibiting the binding of polymyxins. Even more
worrisome, polymyxin- and carbapenem-resistant clinical isolates have been increas-
ingly identified, including the first MCR-1- and NDM-5-coproducing E. coli isolate
(MCR1_NJ) in the United States, which was recently reported by our group (4). MCR1_
NJ was isolated from a patient in New Jersey who had a history of prostate cancer and
developed recurrent urinary tract infections. The E. coli urinary isolate was found to
contain both mcr-1 and blaNDM-5 genes on separate plasmids (pMCR1-NJ-IncX4 and
PNDM5-NJ-IncX3, respectively), in addition to other resistance determinants for ami-
noglycosides, �-lactams, chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones, rifampin, sulfonamides,
and tetracycline. Worryingly, there are a growing number of similar Enterobacteriaceae
strains with MCR-1 coexisting with NDM-1, NDM-5, and NDM-9 (5–8). Truly pan-drug-
resistant (PDR) strains of Enterobacteriaceae harboring blaNDM have recently been
reported in the United States (9) and worldwide (10), with chromosomal mutations in
mgrB accounting for polymyxin resistance in these isolates. Cumulatively, these findings
have escalated the threat of a “postantibiotic” era; it may only be a matter of time
before hospitals around the world face a large outbreak of MCR-1- and NDM-producing
Enterobacteriaceae (11, 12).
The clinical impact of infections caused by mcr-1- or blaNDM-harboring bacteria is
currently unknown. However, infections by CRE with non-MCR-1, chromosomally en-
coded polymyxin resistance mechanisms result in unacceptably high mortality rates
that may be in excess of 60% (13, 14). The medical community is unprepared to treat
Gram-negative pathogens harboring mcr-1 and blaNDM due to the lack of published in
vitro, animal, or clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of the limited treatment
options. Therefore, it is imperative to elucidate optimized therapeutic strategies using
currently available antimicrobials to therapeutically prepare for these very problematic
pathogens. Here, we describe for the first time the pharmacodynamic activities of
antimicrobial combinations against E. coli MCR1_NJ, the first reported isolate from the
United States coharboring MCR-1 and NDM.
Results. In the dose-ranging time-kill experiments against MCR1_NJ at an ~106-
CFU/ml inoculum, the minimum amikacin concentration required to achieve undetect-
able bacterial counts at 24 h was 256 mg/liter. The addition of polymyxin B reduced the

 concentration of amikacin required to achieve no bacterial growth to 64 mg/liter
(3.04-fold reduction in the fitted 50% effective concentration [EC50]). The minimum
aztreonam concentration required to cause undetectable bacterial growth after 24 h
was 4 mg/liter; polymyxin B reduced the aztreonam concentration requirement for
undetectable growth to 1 mg/liter (3.73-fold reduction in the fitted EC50). At an
~106-CFU/ml inoculum of E. coli MCR1_NJ in the hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM)
(Fig. 1A1 to A7), polymyxin B and amikacin monotherapies caused maximal bacterial
reductions within 6 h of 1.72 and 3.34 log10 CFU/ml, respectively, followed by bacterial

quantified using MHA plates imbued with the specified concentrations of polymyxin B (blue lines), aztreonam (red lines), or amikacin (green lines). Humanized
regimens of polymyxin B with front loading (3.33 mg/kg for 1 dose followed by 1.43 mg/kg q12h starting 12 h later), aztreonam (2 g q8h), and amikacin
(15 mg/kg q24h) were simulated over 240 h.

 regrowth by 24 h. A combination of polymyxin B and amikacin prolonged the time until
regrowth until 96 h and resulted in maximal bacterial killing of 6.10 log10 CFU/ml at
30 h. Population analysis profiles (PAPs) obtained throughout exposure to amikacin
monotherapy or the polymyxin B-plus-amikacin combination revealed a 3.06- and a
4.05-log10 CFU/ml increase of the amikacin-resistant subpopulation (64-mg/liter
amikacin-imbued agar), respectively, at 240 h compared to this subpopulation in the
growth control. In contrast to the amikacin resistance, MCR1_NJ polymyxin B resistance
remained stable during each HFIM experiment regardless of polymyxin exposure.
Aztreonam monotherapy, polymyxin B plus aztreonam, and the triple combination
resulted in bacterial reductions of �6 log10 CFU/ml and undetectable bacterial counts
that were sustained through 240 h beginning after 48 h, 24 h, and 26 h, respectively.
These three antibiotic regimens also suppressed polymyxin, aztreonam, and amikacin
resistance.
The antibiotic regimens caused similar bacterial killing and resistance patterns at the
~108-CFU/ml starting inoculum of E. coli MCR1_NJ (Fig. 1B1 to B7); aztreonam mono-
therapy, polymyxin B plus aztreonam, and the triple combination all drove total
bacterial counts to be undetectable (�8-log10 CFU/ml reductions in total bacterial
counts). The most notable difference at the ~108-CFU/ml starting inoculum was the
marked turbidity (240-h optical density at 620 nm [OD620]) observed through 240 h in
the aztreonam monotherapy (OD620 of 0.108) and polymyxin B-plus-aztreonam (OD620
of 0.083) HFIM cartridges, despite no observed bacterial growth, compared to the clear
cultures observed only for the triple combination. Visualization of MCR1_NJ from the
HFIM before and after exposure to aztreonam monotherapy or polymyxin B plus
aztreonam using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed an elongation of the
bacterial cells from the baseline (Fig. 2). The long, filamentous E. coli cells from the HFIM
that was exposed to aztreonam were each ~2 times wider and up to at least 6 times
longer than unexposed bacterial cells. Exposure to polymyxin B plus aztreonam also
induced outer membrane damage to the MCR1_NJ cells, as demonstrated by protru-
sions across the entire cell surface.
Treatment with amikacin or polymyxin B plus amikacin against ~108 CFU/ml of
MCR1_NJ caused maximal bacterial reductions after 4 h of 2.43 and 3.10 log10 CFU/ml,
respectively, before regrowth occurred. For the 3 regimens that resulted in bacterial
regrowth at the ~108-CFU/ml inoculum, the polymyxin B PAPs remained relatively
unchanged throughout 240 h; there was no appreciable proliferation of polymyxin-
resistant subpopulations (polymyxin B MIC at 0 h [MIC0h] of 4 mg/liter and MIC240h of
4 mg/liter). The bacterial regrowth after treatment with amikacin or polymyxin B plus
amikacin was accompanied by increases of 2.99 log10 CFU/ml (amikacin MIC0h of 4
mg/liter and MIC240h of �64 mg/liter) and 2.17 log10 CFU/ml (amikacin MIC0h of 4
mg/liter and MIC240h of 32 mg/liter), respectively, in the amikacin-resistant subpopu-
lation (64-mg/liter amikacin-imbued agar) compared to this population in the growth
control. There were no aztreonam-resistant subpopulations detected after 240 h in the
HFIM for any antibiotic regimen at either starting inoculum.
E. coli MCR1_NJ’
s growth at the ~108-CFU/ml inoculum when exposed to polymyxin
B monotherapy closely mirrored that of the growth control. Whole-genome sequencing
(WGS) after exposure to the polymyxin B front-load regimen for 24 and 240 h revealed
6 and 8 homozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), respectively, (no ho-
mozygous indels) compared to the sequence of unexposed MCR1_NJ. However, none
of the SNPs were detected in genes previously associated with polymyxin resistance.
Further examination confirmed that there were no heterozygous variants in any of the
previously identified polymyxin resistance genes. These WGS results are consistent with
the stable MCR1_NJ phenotypic response to polymyxin B treatment in the HFIM
(polymyxin B MIC of 4 mg/liter from 0 to 240 h). Thus, in the mcr-1-harboring MCR1_NJ
isolate, polymyxin exposure did not potentiate polymyxin resistance through the
acquisition of a new mutation.

 Discussion. Infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae that harbor mcr-1 and blaNDM-5
represent an urgent global health threat, currently lacking evidence-based therapeutic
strategies. Furthermore, there are no novel antibacterial agents in the current drug
development pipeline active against MCR-1- and NDM-producing Enterobacteriaceae
(15). This highlights the critical need to optimize our existing antibiotics for the future
occurrence of these pathogens in the clinical setting. In the present study, we deter-
mined that a triple combination of polymyxin B, aztreonam, and amikacin was able to
eradicate E. coli MCR1_NJ, the first reported isolate in the United States to produce
MCR-1 and NDM, at both low and high bacterial densities in an in vitro HFIM. This
finding supports the idea that polymyxin B may still be an integral component of
treatment in combination with other antimicrobials for mcr-1-harboring organisms
whose polymyxin MICs are typically around the susceptibility cutoff. Against MCR1_NJ,

exposure to polymyxin B plus aztreonam (E). Bacterial samples were prepared and imaged on 0.2-�m filter paper, which is seen

 a polymyxin B front-loaded regimen alone resulted in regrowth at high and low initial
inocula. However, despite extensive selection pressure by polymyxin B, MCR1_NJ did
not acquire a chromosomal polymyxin resistance mutation, and the polymyxin B MIC
remained remarkably stable at 4 mg/liter through 10 days. The stability of polymyxin
resistance additionally suggests that the administration of polymyxin antibiotics to
mcr-1-harboring organisms is unlikely to have a collateral impact to potentiate high
levels of polymyxin resistance such as have been described for polymyxin-induced
chromosomal mutations in mgrB or pmrAB (16, 17). The effect of polymyxin mono-
therapy on polymyxin-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae, where high levels of resistance
almost always emerge, is in stark contrast to the stable, low-level polymyxin resistance
observed in mcr-1-harboring organisms (18). This may also support the use of short-
duration polymyxin B regimens that can generate concentrations above the MIC.
Amikacin monotherapy or a combination of polymyxin B and amikacin resulted in
rapid proliferation of MCR1_NJ amikacin-resistant subpopulations and corresponding
increases in the amikacin MICs. Although AAC(6=)-Ib has been reported to confer
amikacin and tobramycin resistance (19), E. coli MCR1_NJ was initially susceptible to
amikacin despite harboring the aac(6=)-Ib-cr resistance gene. A majority of NDM-
producing organisms are resistant to each of the aminoglycosides; however, previous
surveillance studies have shown that amikacin may retain its bactericidal activity more
frequently than gentamicin or tobramycin (20, 21). Further investigation is required to
determine the precise mechanism of amikacin resistance proliferation and to determine
its clinical relevance. The regrowth of E. coli MCR1_NJ upon exposure to amikacin
represents a potentially significant clinical limitation to aminoglycoside utilization in
the absence of genomic screening and further supports the significant promise of the
triple-antimicrobial combination reported here.
Unexpectedly, aztreonam monotherapy or a combination of polymyxin B and
aztreonam at a high initial inoculum of E. coli MCR1_NJ caused undetectable bacterial
counts despite visible turbidity in the HFIM cartridges for 240 h. Thus, we used scanning
electron microscopy to visualize cells following exposure to these two aztreonam-
containing regimens and observed long, filamentous cells. The turbidity of the samples
from the HFIM cartridge, with an absence of bacterial growth on agar plates and the
visualized filamentous cells, demonstrates the remarkable capacity for MCR1_NJ to
persist in the face of prolonged, intensive antibiotic exposure and is ultimately sug-
gestive of a long, filamentous, nonreplicating persister (NRP) phenotype (Fig. 2) (22).
The E. coli MCR1_NJ NRPs, caused by aztreonam monotherapy or a combination of
polymyxin B and aztreonam, could not be grown or quantified by typical colony-
counting techniques on antibiotic-free media (Mueller-Hinton agar or broth, grown for
up to 7 days), likely due to their inability to divide. Importantly, these filamentous
MCR1_NJ populations were not accompanied by aztreonam resistance, as aztreonam-
resistant colonies were not detected in PAPs. Gladys Hobby et al. (23) and Joseph
Bigger (24) first described the bacterial-persister phenomenon in the 1940s in reference
to subpopulations of bacteria that were remarkably tolerant to antibiotics following
exposure to penicillin. Subsequent studies regarding NRPs have revealed that despite
retaining antibiotic susceptibility, they enter into an antibiotic-tolerant, slowly growing
or nonreplicating state that can later be reverted to the original phenotype under
specific conditions (25). The elongated and filamentous E. coli cells that were observed
following aztreonam exposure are likely a product of penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP3)
inhibition, which has been shown to inhibit cell division by prevention of cellular
septation, subsequently leading to filamentation (22). Thus, bactericidal doses of
aztreonam against a high density of MCR1_NJ likely killed the susceptible fraction of
the total population, leaving behind an aztreonam-tolerant subpopulation of E. coli that
subsequently elongated due to PBP3 inhibition. Interestingly, persister levels have been
shown to increase sharply during late exponential growth, reaching ~1% of the
population by stationary phase, which may help to explain the detection of the NRP
phenotype following aztreonam exposure only at the higher bacterial density (26).

 Although the clinical implications of nonreplicating, persistent filamentous cells are
yet to be completely defined, since these bacteria often remain metabolically active
and are capable of awakening from their tolerant phase following the removal of
antibiotic pressure, they may be responsible for some recurrent or relapsing infections
(27). These findings highlight potential limitations to certain aztreonam-based regi-
mens against infections involving high bacterial densities of mcr-1- and blaNDM-5-
coharboring E. coli strains that have been defined as aztreonam susceptible only by
traditional MIC-testing techniques. However, aztreonam monotherapy may still be an
important treatment strategy to combat low-bacterial-density infections caused by
these pathogens, since no NRPs were observed at the low inoculum in the HFIM.
Further studies are required to analyze the triple combination of polymyxin B, aztreo-
nam, and amikacin against E. coli isolates that are aztreonam resistant, such as through
the presence of blaCTX-M, while still coharboring mcr-1 and blaNDM-5.
In summary, we have characterized for the first time the pharmacodynamics of a
triple combination against Enterobacteriaceae coharboring mobile polymyxin and car-
bapenem resistance genes. The combination of polymyxin B, aztreonam, and amikacin
may, through suppression of resistance and prevention of long, filamentous NRP
formation, be an effective treatment option to combat infections caused by bacteria
that harbor both mcr-1 and blaNDM-5. The absence of a chromosomal mutation con-
ferring additional polymyxin resistance in MCR1_NJ despite polymyxin B exposure
could additionally support the use of this polymyxin-based combination strategy to
treat infections with mcr-1-harboring organisms in an era of few treatment options.
Additional studies should be conducted using animal models to fully elucidate the
efficacy of this triple combination and the clinical relevance of NRPs prior to clinical
evaluation and implementation.
Methods. E. coli isolate MCR1_NJ grown on Mueller-Hinton II agar (MHA) containing
2 mg/liter polymyxin B (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) was
utilized for all experiments (4). The MICs for MCR1_NJ were obtained for all antimicro-
bials utilized in this experiment via broth microdilution in duplicate according to CLSI
guidelines (Table 1) (28). Time-kill studies were conducted as previously described (29)
at an inoculum of ~106 CFU/ml to uncover the antimicrobial regimens with the greatest
pharmacodynamic activity as defined by eradication at 24 h. The following antimicro-
bials that are commercially available in the United States for the treatment of infections
caused by Gram-negative bacteria were tested alone or in combination with polymyxin
B: amikacin (37.5 mg/liter), ampicillin-sulbactam (100/50 mg/liter), aztreonam (75 mg/
liter), cefoxitin (65 mg/liter), ceftazidime (80 mg/liter), ceftazidime-avibactam (80/
15 mg/liter), ceftolozane-tazobactam (55/15 mg/liter), chloramphenicol (32 mg/liter),
ciprofloxacin (5 mg/liter), meropenem (50 mg/liter), nitrofurantoin (40 mg/liter),

 piperacillin-tazobactam (75/15 mg/liter), polymyxin B (6 mg/liter), rifampin (3.5 mg/
liter), tigecycline (2 mg/liter), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (30/4 mg/liter). An-
timicrobials that eradicated MCR1_NJ at 24 h in the time-kill experiments were selected
for validation in the hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM). The two combinations that
resulted in undetectable bacterial counts at 24 h were polymyxin B plus aztreonam and
polymyxin B plus amikacin. To intensely investigate the concentration-response effect
for these antibiotics alone and in the presence of polymyxin B, dose-ranging time-kill
experiments were conducted at an inoculum of ~106 CFU/ml of MCR1_NJ with poly-
myxin B (2.41 mg/liter) combined with either aztreonam (0.016, 0.063, 0.25, 1.0, 4.0, 16,
64, and 256 mg/liter) or amikacin (0.016, 0.063, 0.25, 1.0, 4.0, 16, 64, and 256 mg/liter).
The HFIM studies were conducted over 10 days using cellulosic cartridges (cartridge
C3008; FiberCell Systems, Inc., Frederick, MD) with 18 ml of either ~106 or ~108 CFU/ml
of E. coli MCR1_NJ, as described previously (30). Polymyxin B (half-life [t1/2] � 8 h),
aztreonam (t1/2 � 2 h), and amikacin (t1/2 � 2 h) regimens were simulated alone or in
double or triple combinations in the HFIM based on human pharmacokinetic data as
follows (31–33): (i) polymyxin B front load of 3.33 mg/kg for 1 dose followed by
1.43 mg/kg every 12 h (q12h) starting 12 h later, with a maximum concentration of free,
unbound drug (fCmax) of 3.61 mg/liter and an area under the concentration-time curve
from 0 to 24 h for the free, unbound fraction of drug (fAUC0�24) of 48.2 mg · h/liter
during the first day and an fCmax of 2.41 mg/liter and fAUC24 of 35.9 mg · h/liter at
steady state; (ii) aztreonam at 2 g q8h with an fCmax of 95.3 mg/liter and fAUC0�24 of
807.9 mg · h/liter during the first day and an fCmax of 95.3 mg/liter and fAUC24 of 827.2
mg · h/liter at steady state; and (iii) amikacin at 15 mg/kg q24h with an fCmax of 50.1
mg/liter and fAUC24 of 153.6 mg · h/liter throughout every day.
The MCR1_NJ baseline MICs for polymyxin B, aztreonam, and amikacin were 4,
�0.25, and 4 mg/liter, respectively (Table 1). For combination regimens, polymyxin B
was supplemented into the central reservoir of the HFIM every 1.2 h to maintain a
pharmacokinetic profile consistent with a t1/2 of 8 h (34). Total bacterial counts and
population analysis profiles (PAPs) were performed during the HFIM by plating 50-�l
aliquots of bacterial samples onto MHA plates without drug for total counts or onto
plates containing polymyxin B (2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 mg/liter), aztreonam (0.25, 2, and
16 mg/liter), or amikacin (4, 16, or 64 mg/liter) for PAPs. The antibiotic concentrations
in the HFIM were validated using samples that were obtained over a 48-h period.
Polymyxin B concentrations were determined by a liquid chromatography (LC) single-
quadrupole mass spectrometry (MS) method described previously (35). Amikacin con-
centrations were validated using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) method (Dionex ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography [UHPLC]
and triple-stage quadrupole [TSQ] Endura instruments; Thermo Scientific, Waltham,
MA). The amikacin calibration curve from 1 to 75 mg/liter was linear, with an overall
assay precision ranging from 1.7 to 4.9%. Aztreonam concentrations were analyzed
using an LC-MS/MS method (Agilent series 6460 triple-quadrupole LC-MS/MS coupled
with Agilent series 1260 LC; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The compound was
extracted by protein precipitation using acetonitrile containing amdinocillin as an
internal standard. A gradient method was employed, with the mobile phase consisting
of water with 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. The calibration
curve was linear over a range of 1 to 100 mg/liter (R2 � 0.997). There was satisfactory
agreement between the observed and targeted pharmacokinetic profiles for polymyxin
B (R2 � 0.93, slope � 0.69, and intercept � �0.02), amikacin (R2 � 0.99, slope � 0.87,
and intercept � 1.90), and aztreonam (R2 � 0.98, slope � 0.86, and intercept � 9.05).
Whole-genome DNA sequencing (WGS) and analyses were performed as previously
described (36) to assess the influence of polymyxin B exposure on the E. coli MCR1_NJ
genotype. The sequences of E. coli MCR1_NJ prior to antibiotic exposure (0 h), the E. coli
MCR1_NJ unexposed growth control (240 h), and E. coli MCR1_NJ after polymyxin B
exposure (24 h and 240 h) were compared. Samples for sequencing were obtained from
the HFIM at the respective time points, and genomic DNA was extracted using a Wizard
Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The Nextera DNA library prep-

 aration kit was used for genome library preparation, and the library was then se-
quenced using the Illumina NextSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Quality-
trimmed reads of mutants were aligned to the reference genome (MCR1_NJ, accession
number MAJK00000000) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (37). Single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion-deletion sites (indels) were called using SAMtools
(38) and VarScan (39), followed by annotation using snpEff (40). The default setting of
�75% for variant allele frequency was used to call homozygous variants (SNPs and
indels), and allele frequencies of between 10 and 75% were used to detect heterozy-
gous variants.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a field emission scanning electron mi-
croscope with an Oxford energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (Hitachi SU70; Hitachi
High Technologies America, Inc., Schaumburg, IL) was utilized to visualize E. coli
MCR1_NJ. Images were obtained from HFIM samples prior to antibiotic exposure (0 h)
and from 2 experimental samples (24 h and 240 h) where turbidity in the cellulosic
HFIM cartridges was observed without cell growth on MHA plates (aztreonam mono-
therapy and polymyxin B plus aztreonam against the ~108-CFU/ml E. coli MCR1_NJ
starting inoculum).
