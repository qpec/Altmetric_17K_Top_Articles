Abstract
Background and objectives Young adults receiving RRT face additional challenges in life. The effect of established
kidney failure on young adulthood is uncertain. We aimed to establish the psychosocial and lifestyle status of
young adults receiving RRT.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements Our study was a systematic review and meta-analysis of 16–30-year
olds receiving RRT compared with the general population. We selected randomized, controlled trials; cohort
studies; or cross-sectional studies without language restriction and extracted proportions of sociodemographic
and lifestyle outcomes or validated psychologic health tests producing quality of life, wellbeing, and self-esteem
scores. We undertook random effects meta-analysis.
Results There were 60 studies with a total of 15,575 participants. Studies were largely single-center cross-sectional
studies of those transplanted in childhood. Compared with healthy peers, young adults on RRT had lower quality
of life, which was worse for patients on dialysis (seven studies: standardized mean difference, 21.01; 95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 21.32 to 20.70) compared withpatients with transplants (nine studies: standardized
mean difference, 20.42; 95% CI, 20.64 to 20.20). They were more likely to be unemployed (seven studies: relative
risk,1.89;95%CI,1.47to2.44)andliveinthefamilyhome(twostudies:relativerisk,1.84;95%CI,1.40to2.43).They
were less likely to be married or have a partner (four studies: relative risk, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.95). Higher
education (three studies: relative risk, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.51), alcohol abstinence (three studies: relative risk,
1.96; 95% CI, 0.84 to 4.67), and smoking status (two studies: relative risk, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.36 to 1.44) did not differ.
Results were limited by high heterogeneity and a small evidence base, biased toward surviving patients.
Conclusions Established kidney failure is associated with lower quality of life in young people and limited
employment, independence, and relationships compared with healthy peers.

Introduction
Young adulthood is a distinct developmental period
where physical growth stops but high-level brain func-
tion continues to develop (1). Young adulthood features
growing independence, decision making, self-exploration,
and experimentation. Young adults receiving RRT in high-
income countries are mostly transplanted (70% of United
States 0–21-year olds [2] and 73% of United Kingdom 18–
24-year olds [3]) and must learn to integrate responsibility
for managing their condition into their changing lives.
There are little data regarding psychosocial outcomes
for young adults, an area not captured by most disease
registers. Although young adults are known to be high
risk for graft failure (4,5), the extent to which established
kidney failure has affected their social status, mental
health, and lifestyle remains unclear. The literature to
date focuses on single-center cohorts of transplanted
children followed to young adulthood and the process
of transition to adult services (6,7). Those receiving
dialysis, those presenting directly to adult services,
and nonsurviving patients are under-represented.
We aimed to review the literature systematically to
establish the sociodemographic, psychologic health, and
lifestyle status of young adults receiving RRT. This in-
formation is important to determine whether patients lead
comparable lives to their healthy peers. We hypothesized
that young adults receiving RRT would be psychosocially
disadvantaged compared with healthy peers.
Materials and Methods
We conducted this systematic review in accordance
with Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epi-
demiology criteria (8) rather than Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses,
because it is more appropriate for observational
studies. We did not use a review protocol.
Eligibility Criteria
We used the criteria defined in Table 1 to select
studies from our systematic search. We included all
studies reporting sociodemographic, psychologic

 health, and lifestyle outcomes for young adults (defined as
ages between 16 and 30 years old at the time of study)
receiving long-term RRT. There is no consensual definition
for young adulthood, and we chose a wide age range to
ensure that we did not miss any important publications.
We included all language types.
Search Strategy
Together with an information specialist, we devised a
sensitive search strategy (Supplemental Material), which we
applied to nine databases (Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO,
Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts [ProQuest],
CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science, Scopus, Open Grey, and
Cochrane Library). We ran our first search in July of 2015 and
repeated the search in August of 2016 (for the latter, limiting
results to those from the last year only). We also screened
references of key articles obtained in our search.
Where studies did not present appropriate data (e.g.,
subgroup data not presented or study published in abstract
form), we asked authors by email for the data if the study
was carried out in the last 5 years; two of five study authors
responded to these requests.
Study Selection, Data Collection, and Risk of Bias Appraisal
We imported all references into Endnote and then used
this software to remove duplicate publications. A.J.H. screened
the titles and abstracts of all citations to identify studies
fulfilling the inclusion criteria. R.L.C. screened a random
sample of 1000 titles and abstracts to ensure consistency.
Concordance was 99%, and any disagreements were resolved
by discussion. We used Google Translate to screen non-
English abstracts and arranged formal translation of included
non-English articles.
Where there were multiple versions of the same study,
we selected the more comprehensive/substantive version
(e.g., journal article over conference abstract or journal
articles arising from theses). We recorded study character-
istics and used the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) to assess
the risk of bias for all studies (9). A high NOS score (range
from zero to nine) indicates a lower risk of bias. A.J.H.
assessed bias in all included studies. R.L.C. independently
assessed bias in a random sample of six (10%) of the
included studies to ensure a fair appraisal. Any disagree-
ments were resolved by discussion.
Summary Measures and Synthesis of Results
We examined studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria and
collated whether studies reported common outcome mea-
sures (regardless of scales used) before deciding on which
outcome measures were amenable to meta-analysis. If a study
presented multiple scales for a single outcome, we chose the
most frequently used scale for analysis. We compared the data
across studies and devised a data collection form to obtain
consistently reported data. Study review and data extraction
were performed by A.J.H. R.L.C. independently extracted data
from a random sample of six (10%) of the included studies to
ensure consistency and accuracy. There was 100% concor-
dance for data extraction.
Statistical Methods and Subgroup Analyses
For outcomes reported as proportions, we extracted these
and calculated their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) by
assuming a binomial distribution using the Wilson method
(10), because no study reported these. We then performed a
meta-analysis of the outcome proportion using a random
effects model (using the method by DerSimonian and
Laird), because we presumed that there would be marked
between-study heterogeneity given methodologic differ-
ences. We visually examined effect estimates using forest
plots and calculated heterogeneity statistics (I2 and 95% CI
using a noncentral chi squared–based approach [11] and
t2). We did not stratify by modality at enrolment, because
most studies were long-term follow-ups of pediatric pa-
tients with kidney transplants for whom current modality
was not reported or the outcome proportion by modality
was not provided. However, most studies reporting quality
of life scale scores did so by modality, and therefore, one
could compare subgroups.

 For studies with control data, papers reported a pro-
portion/percentage outcome and sample size for the
kidney sample and provided comparative control data
mostly using census/routine survey data (no reported
sample size in seven cases; the number with outcome/total
in three cases and the number with outcome/no total in one
case). We converted outcome rates (95% CI) for the kidney
sample as above. The statistics comparing the kidney sample
with controls were limited; there was no comparison in six
studies, the chi-squared test was used in two studies, P value
was available only in two studies, and a standardized incidence
ratio and P value were given in one study. Therefore, where the
reference sample size was unknown (n=8), we calculated the
risk ratio (RR; 95% CI) by dividing study group risk by control
group risk. This assumed no sampling variation for the larger
reference population, because these are on the basis of much
larger samples and assume that all of the variability in the RR is
determined by the sampling variability in the smaller clinical
group. Our calculated RR matched the standardized incidence
ratio where provided. Where the sample size was known (n=3),
we accounted for reference population variability. We then
inspected forest plots (log RR) and chose to undertake a
random effects meta-analysis (as above) to derive the pooled
RR (95% CI, I2 statistic and 95% CI, t2).
Quality of life is often assessed using the 36-Item Short
Form Health Survey (SF-36) measure, which has four physical
and four mental domains, or the EuroQoL-5 Dimensions
(EQ-5D), which weights five domains (anxiety, pain, mobility,
usual activities, and self-care) to produce a utility score with a
maximum of 100. To summarize the quality of life data to a single
domain or utility score, we converted mean SF-36 domains to an
overall utility score using a model developed by Ara and Brazier
(12), which is regarded as the best approach in the absence of
individual participant–level data. This model was derived
using ordinary least square regression models and weights
each SF-36 domain to derive an EQ-5D utility score as follows:
EQ-5D utility score ¼ 0:03256
þ ð0:0037 3 physical functioningÞ
þ ð0:0011 3 social functionÞ
2 ð0:00024 3 role limitations due to
 physical problemsÞ
þ ð0:00024 3 role limitations due to
emotional problemsÞ
þ ð0:00256 3 mental healthÞ
2 ð0:00063 3 vitalityÞ
þ ð0:00286 3 bodily painÞ
þ ð0:00052 3 general healthÞ:
To derive the SD for the utility score, we used the model-
based approach developed by Wyld et al. (13). This model
derived a regression function using fractional polynomials of
observed SDs against SDs from utility estimates in published
studies as follows:
SD ¼ 0:368 2
�
0:82 3 utility score2�
þ
�
0:625 3 utility score3�
:
We confirmed the validity of this model by showing similar
model-derived SDs and reported SDs in our extracted data.
Because the utility score is numerical, we performed a ran-
dom effects meta-analysis using the Glass method (which
standardizes using the reference group SD) to pool stan-
dardized mean differences (SMDs) using the mean scale
score, SD, and sample size for patient and control groups
stratified by modality. We also used this approach for
the non–SF-36 quality of life scales. We derived both the
overall heterogeneity statistics (I2 and 95% CI, t2) as well as
assessing for subgroup (transplant versus dialysis) het-
erogeneity to test for an interaction. If studies did not
report a normative comparator, we still included them in
the meta-analysis if we were able to find appropriate
country- and age-specific control data (mean, SDs). We
undertook several sensitivity analyses. We repeated the
meta-analysis excluding the studies with derived control
data to see if this altered our results qualitatively. We also
performed separate meta-analyses by modality. Stratifying
by modality in some cases meant including two subgroups
from the same study. This does not affect the point esti-
mate, because the data points were independent; however,
because the two subgroups come from the same study,
there is the potential for structural clustering, so that the
SEMs for the pooled modality estimates may be under-
estimated. We investigated this by repeating the meta-anal-
ysis by modality but this time, meta-analyzing the treatment
by modality interaction in studies that reported data for both
patients with transplants and patients on dialysis. We
assessed for small study effects using funnel plots, comparing
by modality and excluding studies that did not report nor-
mative comparators (to avoid artificially inflating the effect
estimate sample size). To help the reader contextualize the
SMD results, we used normative data from the 2012 Health
Survey for England (14) and backcalculated the differences in
the SMD for the patients with kidney disease to an absolute
EQ-5D utility using the reported SD.
For studies reporting other scale scores, we performed a
random effects meta-analysis using the same methods as
for the utility score analysis. We used Stata 14 for our
analyses.
Results
Description of Included Studies
We included 60 studies in our quantitative review. We
identified seven qualitative studies, which are not discussed
further. Figure 1 shows the results of our systematic searches,
and Supplemental Table 1 details the characteristics of the
included studies. Table 2 summarizes the study attributes
and highlights that most studies were small (median of 42
participants; interquartile range, 25–78), single center (75%),
and cross-sectional (80%). One half of the studies examined
young people transplanted in childhood. Studies were
mainly from high-income countries (78%). Where reported,
the recruitment, response rate, and key variable completeness
of the various study types were reasonably high. However,
the response rate was not reported in two thirds of surveys.
Risk of Bias
The modified NOS scores are shown in Table 2. The risk
of bias was higher in studies that did not report any
normative comparator data. The overall scale median
percentage score was 71% (interquartile range, 50–75).

 Because 80% of our identified publications were cross-
sectional, they are subject to attrition bias; patients who
may have died over follow-up are, by definition, not
included, and hence, the observed results may be biased
toward better outcomes. Two thirds of studies involved
surveys and/or interviews, in which engaged patients are
more likely to take part (selection bias). In addition, given
the subjective nature of many of the outcomes, there may
be recall and interviewer bias. Two thirds of studies
involved patients with transplants; one half of the studies
only recruited participants on the basis that they were
transplanted as children, so that young adults presenting
later may be under-represented. Most studies were Euro-
pean/North American, reflecting a geographic bias toward
these health care systems. Three quarters of studies in-
volved convenience sampling from single centers; here,

 center performance and clinician motivation may also bias
results.
Observed Proportions
The pooled proportion estimates for sociodemographic,
psychologic health, and lifestyle outcomes are shown in
Table 3. Sociodemographic outcomes were commonly re-
ported. There was considerable heterogeneity, which was
unaffected by stratifying by modality at enrolment.
There were fewer studies examining psychologic health,
with depression or anxiety being most frequently reported,
although there was marked heterogeneity. Most of the data
were pooled from three studies that studied patients with
transplants using the same questionnaire (15–17), and apart
from depression/anxiety and body image, all of the esti-
mates were from studies examining patients with trans-
plants. The apparent disparity between suboptimal mental
health and good satisfaction in other areas of life may be
explained by the small number of studies and patient
modality.
In terms of lifestyle, there were again few studies and
high heterogeneity for the proportions of those currently

aWe used this tool to assess bias in all study types and modified it by omitting points where not applicable. For all studies, we omitted
points for “demonstration that outcome of interest was not present at start of study” and “was follow-up long enough for outcomes to
occur.” For uncontrolled studies, we also omitted points for “selection of the nonexposed cohort” and “comparability.” We compared
total scores by study type and compared all studies using percentage scores.

Outcomes Relative to Healthy Controls
The pooled effect estimates of sociodemographic, psycho-
logic health, and lifestyle outcomes compared with healthy
controls are shown in Table 4. Few studies presented norma-
tive comparison data, and when pooled, they were very
heterogeneous.
Young adults on RRT were more likely to be unemployed
(eight studies: RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.47 to 2.44) and live in the
family home (two studies: RR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.40 to 2.43).
They were less likely to be married/have a partner (four
studies: RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.95). Higher education
(three studies: RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.51), alcohol
abstinence (three studies: RR, 1.96; 95% CI, 0.84 to 4.67),
and smoking status (two studies: RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.36 to
1.44) did not differ.
Psychologic Health Scales
Only five of nine studies measuring quality of life in
patients with transplants reported normative comparison
data, and similarly, only three of seven studies in patients
on dialysis reported these data (Table 4). The study sample
sizes were small, particularly for patients on dialysis
(median n=17). Heterogeneity was less when stratifying
by modality but remained high. The SF-36 was the most
frequently used scale (n=4). Seven studies reported relevant

Although clustering (potential correlation from including subgroups taken from the same study) may underestimate between-study
variance, the overall quality of life result showed a compensatory larger variance in effect size (t2 value). To overcome any effect of

 quality of life measures, which we could not include in
the meta-analysis due to missing variability data (n=3) or
control data (n=4).
Young adults on RRT had lower quality of life compared
with their peers, which was worse for patients on dialysis
(seven studies: SMD, 21.01; 95% CI, 21.32 to 20.70) com-
pared with patients with transplants (nine studies: SMD,
20.42; 95% CI, 20.64 to 20.20) (Figure 2). This equates to
the following absolute differences in EQ-5D utilities: mean
utility for 16–30 year olds (n=1333) from the Health Survey
for England 2012 was 93 of 100 (SD=14.7; 95% CI, 92.2 to
93.8) (14); the average adjusted score for patients with
transplants is 6.2 points lower at 86.8 (95% CI, 83.6 to 90.1)
and 14.8 points lower at 78.2 (95% CI, 73.6 to 82.7) for
patients on dialysis. This modality effect was also seen
when meta-analyzing the interaction terms (data are in
Table 4). We found no evidence for small study effects
(P=0.70), but analysis lacked power, because few studies
were available for inclusion.
We found no differences in the Positive and Negative
Affect Schedule and the Rosenberg Self-Image Scale and
Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents, although these
were measured in few studies with small numbers of
participants and subject to high heterogeneity. Five studies
reported relevant self-concept, self-esteem, or self-image
scale measures, which we could not include in the meta-
analysis due to missing information (n=2) or a lack of
control data (n=3). Three studies reported coping via the
use of different multidomain scales and could not be
combined in a meta-analysis.
Discussion
Key Findings
This systematic review establishes the negative social
and psychologic effects (lower quality of life and limited
employment, independence, and relationships) of ESRD
on young adults compared with healthy controls and
highlights the limitations of existing research. We have
found a marked drop in quality of life, particularly for
patients on dialysis compared with those who were
transplanted. Young adults on RRT were also more likely
to be unemployed, despite a similar proportion having
higher education as in the general population (on the basis
of only three studies). The effect estimates that we present
are likely to be biased toward better outcomes, because
many studies examined patients with transplants and
may be subject to a healthy responder bias.

 Comparison with Existing Studies
To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative systematic
review of psychosocial and lifestyle outcomes for young
adult patients on RRT. We found a similar drop in quality
of life for dialysis compared with transplant as a previous
systematic review in an older adult population (13);
however, comparison is limited, because we calculated a
Z score relative to the general population, whereas Wyld
et al. (13) reported absolute utility scores.
Implications for Research and Clinical Care
This meta-analysis has identified some areas of concern
regarding the long-term sociodemographic and psycho-
logic outcomes for young adults with ESRD. However, one
must be cautious in interpreting these results given the
limitations highlighted below. These data, despite a small
evidence base, suggest limited life chances and need further
attention to establish how young adults receiving RRT
function in society and potential barriers that they may face
to establishing successful employment, independent living,
and long-term relationships. It is possible that psychosocial
outcomes may be more meaningful to patients than bio-
chemical and intermediate outcomes often collected by
registries. In the short term, we are undertaking a large-
scale national multicenter study looking at a young adult
population of all treatment modalities: The Surveying
People Experiencing Young Adult Kidney Failure Study
(18). The results may raise awareness in the clinical setting
and shift the focus of outcomes onto those that matter most
to patients, perhaps prompting disease registers to collect
patient-centered outcomes. Ideally, researchers should
undertake a large, prospective cohort study collecting base-
line data in childhood, with repeat outcome measure data
that span the transition into adulthood as well as later life.
Comparative longitudinal population data, using the same
methods, should also be available to facilitate interpretation.
Such a study would be costly, be challenging, and take at
least a decade to undertake, but it would provide a far more
robust evidence base on the needs of this ESRD population.
Strengths and Limitations
The strengths of this review are the wide search criteria
to ensure that all relevant studies were included, the
inclusion of gray literature and non-English articles, and
repeating the systematic search to capture new studies.
Furthermore, we have gone to great lengths not to lose
valuable data by contacting authors for other data, con-
verting different outcomes to a common metric, and
searching appropriate comparative data to provide addi-
tional measures of outcome differences.
There are also limitations to be considered. First, the
evidence base was small. Second, in some cases, we had to
assume no sampling variation in reference populations of
unreported size. This results in artificially small 95% CIs
around the difference. Nonetheless, in all cases where this
assumption was made, the normative data were on the
basis of census data or regional/national statistics, and
therefore, this is a minor issue. Third, pooled proportions
come from different studies and therefore, may not always
be directly comparable due to reporting differences.
Fourth, we combined mean domain scores into a single
EQ-5D utility score for the SF-36 quality of life studies.
Although we used established methods for this conversion
and calculation of the score variability, these were vali-
dated in other datasets; however, where data were avail-
able, the predicted values seemed consistent with the
observed. Fifth, many studies did not report subgroups
data, such as sex and modality (except for quality of life),
and therefore, we could not examine these variables for
heterogeneity. Given the paucity of studies, we did not feel
that exploration of between-study variability using meta-
regression would have been helpful; in addition, we were
reassured that subgroups were statistically (but not struc-
turally) independent when including subgroups as indi-
vidual studies in meta-analysis. Sixth, because there were
almost 20,000 abstracts to screen, we only checked a random
sample of 1000 abstracts (5%) for inclusion and six studies
(10%) for independent data extraction, and concordance rates
were high in both cases.
Quantitative Assessment of Bias. The nature of the
studies in this area was such that we could only quantitate
bias by modifying the NOS. For studies without compar-
ator data, this lessened the scope of the bias assessment,
and the risk of bias was higher. However, overall study
quality seemed reasonable. In addition to the NOS, we
summarized the study attributes in Table 2 and described
the potential bias that these attributes suggest.
Justification of Exclusion. We excluded studies where
outcomes were reported by caregiver/family/health or
educational professionals to focus on the patient experience,
particularly from a psychologic perspective. Other reasons
that studies were excluded are included in Figure 1—largely
due to the reported average age of participants being outside
the specified range.
Assessment of Quality of Included Studies. The Oxford
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (19) grades evidence
from level 1a (e.g., homogenous systematic review) to level
5 (e.g., expert opinion without critical appraisal) and grades
recommendations on the basis of such evidence from level
A (consistent level 1 studies) to level D (inconsistent/
inconclusive or level 5 evidence). According to this frame-
work, overall, the studies in this review are from level of
evidence 2b–4 and grade of recommendation B/C. In general,
studies were descriptive, cross-sectional, and single center,
with small numbers of participants. There were no prospective
studies, although three studies were retrospective cohort
studies. Although one third of studies presented normative
data, these almost all used data collected for other purposes.
Generalization of the Conclusions. Our review in-
cluded young adults requiring RRT, and studies appro-
priately focused on patients with transplants, because they
represent much of this age group in high-income countries,
where the studies were mostly undertaken. Therefore, the
effect estimates that we have presented are generalizable to
patients with transplants in high-income countries, but apart
from quality of life, they may not be generalizable to young
adults receiving dialysis. The small number of studies and
high heterogeneity of findings must also be stressed as well
as the inability to explore demographic effects.
In summary, young adults receiving RRT have lower
quality of life and limited employment, independence, and
relationships compared with healthy controls. This review
highlights the limitations of existing research and clarifies
the key patient-reported outcomes to focus on in the future.
