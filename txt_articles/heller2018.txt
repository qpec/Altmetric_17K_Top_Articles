ABSTRACT: Pigment-grade titanium dioxide (TiO2) of 200−300 nm particle diameter is
the most widely used submicron-sized particle material. Inhaled and ingested TiO2
particles enter the bloodstream, are phagocytized by macrophages and neutrophils, are
inflammatory, and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. In this pilot study of 11 pancreatic
specimens, 8 of the type 2 diabetic pancreas and 3 of the nondiabetic pancreas, we show
that particles comprising 110 ± 70 nm average diameter TiO2 monocrystals abound in the
type 2 diabetic pancreas, but not in the nondiabetic pancreas. In the type 2 diabetic
pancreas, the count of the crystals is as high as 108−109 per gram.
■ INTRODUCTION
Inhaled and ingested submicron and micron-sized crystals and
crystal aggregates are associated with chronic inflammatory
degenerative diseases. Diseases of the lung, exemplified by
silicosis and asbestosis, result of inhalation of crystalline silica
and asbestos. Crystals of sodium urate, cystine, calcium oxalate
dihydrate and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate are associated
with chronic inflammatory degenerative diseases of the joints,
kidneys, and urinary tract.
Pigment-grade TiO2, typically of rutile phase and of 200−300
nm particle diameter, about half the wavelength of visible light,
is widely used. Because of its 2.6 index of refraction, it
constitutes the dominant light-scattering, that is, “white”
component of indoor wall paints, drinks, foods, toothpastes,
medications, cosmetics, paper, and plastics. The annual
production of pigment-grade TiO2 has increased in the past
50 years from 2 × 106 tons to 6 × 106 tons, as TiO2 replaced
the earlier used, more toxic, lead carbonate white pigment.
Consumers and patients are routinely exposed to TiO2 crystals,
inhaling and ingesting these.
Earlier studies have established the uptake and pathologies
associated with TiO2 nanocrystals1−9 and of the larger pigment-
grade TiO2 particles.10−21 Animal studies,22 and a study of
factory workers,23 have shown that inhaled pigment-grade TiO2
crystals enter the bloodstream.23 Animal studies,22 and a study
of human volunteers,24 show that also ingested TiO2 crystals
enter the bloodstream. The crystals are phagocytized and are
inflammatory.25−30 By binding to and activating the NLRP3-
(NALP3) inflammasome,12,31−33 a macromolecular complex
found in macrophages, neutrophils, platelets, and microglia, the
TiO2 crystals cause inflammatory cascades leading to death of
proximal cells.
■ EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Specimens. Pancreatic specimens, from the pancreas head, were
received from Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation nPOD at the
University of Florida at Gainesville. Three were nondiabetic, 4 were
type 2 diabetic (T2D), and 4 were T2D with pancreatitis (T2Dp).
Their pathology reports are provided in Table S1 of the Supporting
Information.
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). A JEOL 2010F
transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used for imaging the
crystals. The crystals were about evenly distributed across the used
314-square, 3 mm diameter, 200 mesh copper grids with type-B
carbon supports (Ted Pella Redding CA, catalog number 1810).
Typically, crystals of 3 squares were TEM imaged, that is, 1% of the
applied crystals were counted and examined. Crystallinity was
confirmed by the crystals’ electron diffraction, and then elemental
compositions were determined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectros-
copy. In the elemental analyses the peaks of all elements excepting
carbon were integrated. The reported values are percentages of the
integrals.
Processing of the Pancreatic Specimens for TEM. The
pancreatic samples were processed in plastic-ware as follows: 25 mg
of tissue was minced and digested overnight at ambient temperature
with 1 mL of an aqueous solution containing 25 mg of trypsin (from
bovine pancreas, Sigma catalog number 1426) and 25 mg of proteinase
K (from Tritirachium album, Sigma catalog number P2308). The
proteolytic enzyme-treated suspensions were degreased with hexane.
First the suspensions were centrifuged at 12,000g for 1 h to separate an
oily top layer from the aqueous phase. The oily layer solidified upon
chilling to 0 °C, allowing removal of most of the oil by skimming with
a 2 mm wooden applicator. Because part of the aqueous suspension
was emulsified in the skimmed oil and it could have contained crystals,
the oil was dissolved in 1 mL of hexane and centrifuged for 1 h at

 12,000g. The top hexane layer was pipetted off, and the bottom
aqueous layer was re-extracted with 0.5 mL hexane and centrifuged for
20 min at 12,000g. After the hexane was pipetted off, the aqueous
centrifugate was combined with the main aqueous suspension. The
combined hexane phases were re-extracted with 0.5 mL of water and
centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000g, and the aqueous centrifugate was
again combined with the main aqueous suspension. The aqueous
suspension was recentrifuged at 12,000g for 10 min to separate
residual hexane. About 1 mL of the now degreased aqueous
suspension was obtained. After shaking to homogenize, 5 μL of the
aqueous suspension was water diluted 200-fold to 1 mL. Although the
diluted aqueous solution appeared to be clear and homogeneous, it
was shaken to homogenize, then 5 μL of the solution was pipetted
onto the 3 mm diameter TEM grid. The liquid on the grid was evenly
distributed, and the examined squares were selected from both centers
and peripheries of the grids.
■ RESULTS
To rule out labware-, water-, and reagent-associated crystal
contamination, samples without pancreatic tissue were
identically processed and their 5 μL droplets were applied to
TEM grids. No TiO2 or other crystals were observed. Table 1
shows the number of crystals on TEM grids to which 5 μL
preparation droplets were applied. Of the 85 observed crystals,
56, or 66%, were TiO2 crystals of 110 ± 70 nm average
diameter. Exemplary TiO2 crystals and their selected area
electron diffraction patterns are shown in Figure 1 and in
Figures S1−S6 of the Supporting Information. Seventeen, or
20%, of the crystals were hydrated Fe3+ oxide crystals of 140 ±
100 nm average diameter; 6, or 7%, were calcium oxalate
crystals of 130 ± 70 nm average diameter; and 6, or 7%, were
graphenic carbon crystals of 0.9 ± 0.4 μm average diameter.
While the carbon crystals had stacked graphenic planes, their C-
axes were not developed, differing in this respect from graphite.
All of the TiO2 crystals were in the T2D and T2Dp
specimens, and none in the nondiabetic specimens. In contrast,
hydrated Fe3+ oxide crystals were found also in nondiabetic
specimens. The number of calcium oxalate and carbon crystals
was too small to allow analysis for differences in their
distributions. Elemental compositions of the crystals are
provided in Table 2.
Because the prevalence of T2D increases with age and body
mass index (BMI), the abundance of TiO2 crystals in the T2D
specimen-derived preparations could have been age or BMI
associated, rather than being T2D associated. Age or BMI
association was, however, not evident, as seen in Tables 3 and
4.
■ DISCUSSION
The number of crystals per gram of pancreas (Table 5) can be
estimated through the product N × 1/W × D × A × F. N is the
crystal count in 3 squares of the TEM grid. For 0.025 g tissue
samples, 1/W = 1/0.025 = 40 g−1. Because 5 μL of the enzyme-
digested and hexane extracted preparations were diluted to 1
mL, D = 1000/5 = 200. Because 5 μL of the 1 mL diluted
solution were applied to the 3 mm, 314-squares TEM grid, A =
1000/5 = 200. Becasue crystals were counted in 3 of the 314
squares of the grid, F = 314/3 = 105. The number of crystals
per gram of tissue is, therefore, N × 40 × 200 × 200 × 105 = N
× 1.6 × 108, that is, each detected crystal represents 0.16 billion

 crystals per gram of pancreas. As seen in Table 5, TiO2 crystals
abound in the T2D and the T2Dp pancreas, but not in the
nondiabetic pancreas.
Hydrated Fe3+ oxide crystals, which are well-known residents
of the brain,34 are also prevalent in the diabetic pancreas, but
their count is only 1/4 of that of the TiO2 crystals, and, unlike
the TiO2 crystals, they are found also in the nondiabetic
pancreas.
If the very high count of TiO2 crystals in specimen 6255
would be considered as an outlier, then the count of crystals
could be higher in the T2Dp specimens than in the T2D
specimens, that is, in T2D with pancreatitis, the count would be
the highest.
■ CONCLUSION
This pilot study raises the possibility that T2D could be a
chronic crystal-associated inflammatory disease of the pancreas,
analogous to chronic crystal-caused inflammatory lung diseases
like silicosis and asbestosis. The dominant T2D-ssociated
pancreatic particles consist of 110 ± 70 nm average diameter
TiO2 crystals, attributable to ingested white, that is, visible light
scattering, pigment used in drinks, foods and medications, and/
or to inhaled indoor wall-paint pigment, transported to the
pancreas in the bloodstream. The study raises the possibility
that humanity’s increasing use of TiO2 pigment accounts for
part of the global increase in the incidence of T2D. Being a
pilot study, it requires sufficient expansion of sample sizes for
statistical analysis as well as blinded studies. Should these
confirm that pancreatic TiO2 pigment crystals are associated
with T2D, studies mapping pathways of ingested and/or
inhaled crystals to the pancreas would be warranted, as would
be studies of mechanisms by which the inflammasome
activating crystals reduce insulin supply by causing the death
of proximal pancreatic beta-cells.
