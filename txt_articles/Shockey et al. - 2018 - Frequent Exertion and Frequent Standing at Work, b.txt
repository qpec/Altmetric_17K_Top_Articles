Frequent Exertion and Frequent Standing at Work, by Industry and 
Occupation Group — United States, 2015
Taylor M. Shockey, MPH1; Sara E. Luckhaupt, MD1; Matthew R. Groenewold, PhD1; Ming-Lun Lu, PhD2
Repeated exposure to occupational ergonomic hazards, such as 
frequent exertion (repetitive bending or twisting) and frequent 
standing, can lead to injuries, most commonly musculoskeletal 
disorders (1). Work-related musculoskeletal disorders have been 
estimated to cost the United States approximately $2.6 billion 
in annual direct and indirect costs (2). A recent literature review 
provided evidence that prolonged standing at work also leads to 
adverse health outcomes, such as back pain, physical fatigue, and 
muscle pain (3). To determine which industry and occupation 
groups currently have the highest prevalence rates of frequent 
exertion at work and frequent standing at work, CDC analyzed 
data from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) 
Occupational Health Supplement (OHS) regarding currently 
employed adults in the United States. By industry, the highest 
prevalence of both frequent exertion and frequent standing at 
work was among those in the agriculture, forestry, fishing, and 
hunting industry group (70.9%); by occupation, the highest 
prevalence was among those in the construction and extraction 
occupation group (76.9%). Large differences among industry 
and occupation groups were found with regard to these ergo-
nomic hazards, suggesting a need for targeted interventions 
designed to reduce workplace exposure.
NHIS is an annual, in-person, household interview survey 
of noninstitutionalized, U.S. civilian residents that has been 
continuously conducted since 1957 with the main purpose of 
monitoring the health of the U.S. population through assess-
ment of a range of health topics and demographic characteris-
tics.* The NHIS questionnaire contains a set of core questions 
with Household, Family, Sample Adult, and Sample Child 
components, which have remained relatively unchanged from 
1997 through 2017. In addition, NHIS has sets of questions, 
known as Supplements, which vary each year depending on new 
public health data needs. In 2015, CDC’s National Institute for 
* https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/about_nhis.htm.
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) sponsored an OHS 
to collect information on work-related health conditions as well 
as psychological and physical occupational exposures. The OHS 
questions were included in the Sample Adult questionnaire, 
which had a final, unconditional response rate of 55.2%.†

To determine industry and occupation, currently employed 
adult respondents were asked, in reference to the job they 
were working at during the week before the interview, “What 
kind of business or industry was this?” and “What kind of 
work were you doing?” Open-ended responses were recorded 
as text and subsequently coded by the U.S. Census Bureau 
into 4-digit codes derived from the 2012 North American 
Industrial Classification System (NAICS) industry groups and 
2010 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) occupation 
groups. To improve reliability of the statistical estimates, the 
detailed 4-digit industry and occupation groups were collapsed 
into 2-digit industry groups and occupation groups (based on 
the NAICS and SOC major groups§). As part of the OHS, 
currently employed adults were asked two questions related 
to the ergonomics of their current job: “How often does your 
job involve repeated lifting, pushing, pulling, or bending?” and 
“How often does your job involve standing or walking around?” 
Responses to these questions were dichotomized into Often/
Always and Never/Seldom/Sometimes, to indicate frequent 
or infrequent exertion or standing, respectively. Responses to 
these two ergonomics questions were also used to create one 
dichotomous variable capturing respondents that reported 
both frequent exertion at work and frequent standing at work.
Among the 36,672 adult NHIS respondents, 19,456 
were currently employed and considered for analyses. After 
§ https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2012 and https://
www.bls.gov/soc/major_groups.htm.
excluding 1,615 respondents who worked <20 hours per 
week, 187 respondents who did not provide adequate infor-
mation on their hours worked in the previous week, and 190 
respondents in military-specific occupations, the final analytic 
sample included 17,464 respondents (89.8% of the currently 
employed adult respondents). Sample adults who worked more 
than 20 hours per week were more likely to be aged <65 years, 
men, and hold a college degree or higher; however, there was 
no difference in the distribution of frequent exertion and 
frequent standing by number of hours worked. Unadjusted 
prevalence of frequent exertion at work, frequent standing at 
work, and both frequent exertion and frequent standing at 
work were calculated by the 20 major industry groups and 
the 22 major occupation groups. The unadjusted prevalence 
estimates were obtained using statistical software. All analyses 
were weighted, and standard errors were adjusted to account 
for the survey design.
Overall, 39.5% of currently employed adults who work at 
least 20 hours per week reported both frequent exertion and 
frequent standing at work (Table 1). The prevalences of fre-
quent exertion at work or frequent standing at work, or both 
frequent exertion at work and frequent standing at work were 
highest among men, persons aged 18–29 years, Hispanics, and 
adults with less than a high school diploma (Table 1).
Among the 20 major industry groups, the groups with the 
highest prevalence of both frequent exertion and frequent 
standing at work were agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting 
(70.9%); construction (67.2%); and accommodation and food

services (57.7%) (Table 2). These same three industry groups 
also had the highest prevalence rates of frequent exertion at 
work and frequent standing at work considered separately. 
The finance and insurance industry group had the lowest 
prevalence rates of all three exposures (Table 2). Among the 
22 major occupation groups, the groups with the highest 
prevalence of both frequent exertion and frequent standing 
at work were construction and extraction (76.9%); farming, 
fishing, and forestry (75.5%); and building and grounds clean-
ing and maintenance (74.0%) (Table 3). These same three 
occupation groups also had the highest prevalence rates for 
frequent exertion at work. The food preparation and serving 
related occupation group (97.2%) had the highest prevalence 
of frequent standing at work. The computer and mathematical 
occupation group had the lowest prevalence rate of the com-
bined exposures of frequent exertion and frequent standing at 
work (4.6%) (Table 3).
Discussion
This is the first CDC report to evaluate exposure to frequent 
exertion and frequent standing at work among U.S. employed 
adults in all industries and occupations. The prevalence of 
exposure to both of these ergonomic hazards was higher 
among agricultural and construction workers than among 
workers in all other industries. A previous study using the U.S. 
Department of Labor’s Occupational Information Network 
database found that of 10 detailed occupation categories 
evaluated with regard to self-reported bending or twisting at 
work, half were construction-related, which is consistent with 
the findings from this study (4). In addition, previous research 
using NHIS data that evaluated musculoskeletal disorders 
among agricultural workers found that low back pain was the 
most prevalent musculoskeletal disorder. That study also found 
that agricultural workers had a significantly higher prevalence 
of upper extremity pain compared with all other industries (5). 
Research has shown that agricultural and construction work are 
physically demanding, as these industries often require manual 
material handling, repetitive exertions, awkward body postures, 
and use of machinery that causes whole body vibration (4–7).
Approximately two thirds of all workers reported frequent 
standing at work. The industry and occupation groups that 
reported high prevalence rates of frequent exertion (e.g., farm-
ing, construction, and food services) also tended to report high 
prevalence rates of frequent standing, possibly because bending, 
pushing, pulling, and lifting commonly co-occur with stand-
ing. Several industry and occupation groups, such as education

and protective services, reported a high prevalence of frequent 
standing at work with a low prevalence of frequent exertion at 
work compared with other industry and occupation groups.
Recent studies have emphasized health risks associated with 
excessive sitting during the workday (8); however, excessive 
standing on the job also has been linked to adverse health 
outcomes (9). A systematic review of peer-reviewed articles 
on musculoskeletal symptoms and occupational standing as 
the main exposure variable found that occupational standing 
is associated with low back pain; however, associations with 
lower and upper extremity symptoms were inconclusive (9). 
More research is needed to understand how to balance time 
spent sitting and standing while at work.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, because NHIS data are cross-sectional, it is not 
possible to make causal inferences. Second, because NHIS data 
are self-reported, they are subject to recall or social desirabil-
ity bias. Third, the intermediate exposure categories (Often, 
Sometimes, and Seldom) rely on subjective assessment of fre-

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Occupational ergonomic hazards are risk factors for negative 
health outcomes such as musculoskeletal disorders. Previous 
research has found that employees in the agricultural and 
construction sectors experience high rates of musculoskeletal 
disorders and other injuries because of the physical nature of 
the work and has also found that workers in the construction 
and agricultural sectors have high prevalence rates of exertion 
including bending, lifting, pushing, and pulling.
What is added by this report?
Analysis of data from the National Health Interview Survey to 
examine two ergonomic hazards among currently employed 
adults who work at least 20 hours per week in 20 major industry 
groups and 22 major occupation groups found a 41.7% preva-
lence of frequent exertion (repeated lifting, pushing, pulling, or 
bending) at work and a 66.6% prevalence of frequent standing at 
work. A wide range in prevalence for these ergonomic hazards 
was observed among the industry and occupation groups.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Large differences in prevalence of frequent exertion at work and 
frequent standing at work exist among the major industry and 
occupation groups. Identification of workers with the highest 
prevalences of exposure to these two ergonomic hazards can 
inform the targeting of interventions.
