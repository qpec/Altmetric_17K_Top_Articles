Background
Staff training in positive behaviour support (PBS) is a widespread
treatment approach for challenging behaviour in adults with
intellectual disability.
Aims
To evaluate whether such training is clinically effective in redu-
cing challenging behaviour during routine care (trial registration:
NCT01680276).
Method
We carried out a multicentre, cluster randomised controlled
trial involving 23 community intellectual disability services in
England, randomly allocated to manual-assisted staff training
in PBS (n = 11) or treatment as usual (TAU, n = 12). Data were
collected from 246 adult participants.
Results
No treatment effects were found for the primary outcome
(challenging behaviour over 12 months, adjusted mean differ-
ence = −2.14, 95% CI: −8.79, 4.51) or secondary outcomes.
Conclusions
Staff training in PBS, as applied in this study, did not reduce
challenging behaviour. Further research should tackle imple-
mentation issues and endeavour to identify other interventions
that can reduce challenging behaviour.

Challenging behaviour is common in adults with intellectual dis-
ability, has a reported prevalence of 10–15%,1,2 and often leads to
long-term admission to hospital, restrictive care practices and
neglect.3–5 The need for effective treatment options for challenging
behaviour is urgent. Positive behaviour support (PBS) is recom-
mended in routine care for adults with intellectual disability who
present with challenging behaviour as it has the greatest evidence-
based efficacy. PBS is a multicomponent approach focused on redu-
cing challenging behaviour by using behavioural techniques and
consequently improving quality of life in individuals with intellec-
tual disability6 and other population groups.7–10 PBS aims to help
professionals and family or carers better understand an individual’s
behaviour, and to apply personalised approaches to the manage-
ment of that behaviour. It can be implemented in a number of
ways, including via a single practitioner,11–13 via professional
teams offering interdisciplinary contributions to the PBS frame-
work,14,15 and via a system-wide implementation comprising a
tiered model of prevention that covers an entire organisation or geo-
graphical area.16
The only pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of PBS incorp-
orating applied behaviour analysis was delivered by a specialist
behaviour team in one area in England and it showed promising
results by reducing the lethargy and hyperactivity domain scores
of the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist-Community (ABC-C).17,18
A naturalistic 2-year follow-up of the same trial participants
showed a continued positive effect of the intervention compared
with treatment as usual (TAU).19 Observational studies also
showed that training of paid care staff in PBS reduces challenging
behaviour.20 Evidence indicates that staff competencies are central
in treating challenging behaviour, maintaining improvements21
and reducing reliance on containment and in-patient care.22,23 To
the best of our knowledge, although PBS is considered a cornerstone
of good quality care internationally, staff in community intellectual
disability services may have insufficient skills to deliver it. There are
multiple staff training programmes in PBS that show increases in
knowledge and perceived confidence in managing challenging
behaviour.22 This real-world independent multicentre trial investi-
gated the clinical and cost effectiveness of health staff training in
PBS in addition to TAU to reduce challenging behaviour in adults
with intellectual disability in England. The present article reports
the clinical outcomes of the definitive trial. The economic evalu-
ation of the study is in preparation.
The main objective was to compare the clinical effectiveness of
staff training in PBS with TAU alone over 12 months. Secondary
objectives were to examine (a) the impact of training in PBS in
the subgroup with autism spectrum disorders and (b) the inter-
action between the intervention, gender, level of intellectual disabil-
ity, presence of mental disorder and challenging behaviour.
Method
Study design
The study protocol has been described elsewhere.21 In summary,
this was a multicentre single-blind, parallel, two-arm cluster RCT
of 23 community intellectual disability services in England with
active recruitment.
The British Journal of Psychiatry (2018)

 The study (trial registration: NCT01680276) received ethical
approval by the National Research Ethics Service Committee
London–Harrow (reference 12/LO/1378).
Service and participant recruitment
The community intellectual disability services supporting adults
with intellectual disability and challenging behaviour (hereafter
referred to as clusters) were recruited through the Clinical
Research Networks covering urban and semi-rural/rural areas in
England. The number of registered adults with intellectual disability
in each cluster ranged from 100 to 1000 and services employed a
median of 23 full-time equivalent health and/or social care staff
(range 4–70). A maximum of 14 participants with intellectual dis-
ability aged 18 years and over with any level of intellectual disability
(mild to profound) and challenging behaviour as indicated by a total
score of at least 15 on the ABC-C18 were recruited from each cluster.
Excluded were (a) participants with a primary clinical diagnosis of
personality disorder or substance misuse as there is no evidence
that PBS would be a treatment of choice in these instances, partici-
pants with a relapse of a pre-existing mental disorder, or where the
clinical team decided that a referral to the study would be inappro-
priate; and (b) clusters which had embedded PBS therapists or local
specialist behaviour teams. Health and social care professionals in
each cluster identified potential participants who were screened
for eligibility and expressed interest to meet with researchers prior
to cluster allocation.
Clinical managers in each cluster were asked, and they agreed, to
reduce the routine caseload of the staff who volunteered to train by
about 30% to allow them sufficient time to deliver enhanced treat-
ment to the trial participants. This was based on an assumption of
spending a total of approximately 12.5 h on the intervention per
participant, excluding travel and paperwork.
Easy read information sheets and consent forms were prepared
with assistance from the study service user reference group.
Researchers were trained in obtaining informed consent and in
the study processes. Where a participant lacked capacity, another
adult was identified or nominated to act as consultee on their behalf.
Randomisation and masking
The clusters were randomised by an independent web-based ran-
domisation system (Sealed Envelope) and random permuted
blocks on a 1:1 allocation. We stratified the randomisation by calcu-
lating the staff/patient ratio for each cluster, creating a binary factor
which indicated whether a cluster was below or above the median
ratio. The trial manager contacted the sites to inform them of the
treatment allocation.
Researchers conducting the study assessments were blind to
arm allocation status. Researchers were asked to guess allocation
for each participant at each follow-up point and to report any inci-
dent of unblinding.
Procedures
PBS training
Two health staff (henceforth referred to as therapists) from a variety
of professions – e.g. psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, occupa-
tional therapists, and speech and language therapists – from each
cluster volunteered to receive the training. This included three
2-day face-to-face workshops supported by a manual and delivered
by an organisation with a track record in training delivery across
many clinical settings and a wide consultancy client base.
The curriculum consisted of the following topics that are essen-
tial elements of the application of PBS in routine care:
(a) functional behavioural assessment and formulation skills, using
the Brief Behavioural Assessment Tool for brief functional
analyses
(b) primary prevention of challenging behaviour
(c) secondary prevention and reactive strategies
(d) periodic service review and problem solving
(i) developing individualised periodic service reviews
(ii) troubleshooting.
PBS is a combination of approaches which mainly aim at altering
aspects of the environment that may have an impact on behaviour.
These include understanding the triggers that lead to a behavioural
outburst, improvement of communication between individuals and
their carers, promotion of a person-centred community living and
use of specific techniques to achieve changes in behaviour by
encouraging pro-social responses from the individual. Therapists
were shown how to (a) fill in behavioural charts; (b) work on devel-
oping interventions for each identified behaviour, (c) plan interven-
tions using non-contingent reinforcement, skills teaching and
differential reinforcement; and (d) take into consideration the
impact of other potential triggers such as ill health. Each partici-
pant’s plan should, therefore, include some of these aspects after a
comprehensive assessment and observations. Two cohorts of thera-
pists were trained over a 15-week period and therapists were
expected to have begun work with participants who had completed
a baseline assessment after the first workshop. The therapists
received a certificate of completion of training. This is an accepted
training format deemed appropriate for the study, although varia-
tions in duration and content do exist internationally.
Each therapist was allocated one of the four trainers as a mentor
for 1 year and the therapists were responsible for using this facility
which was aimed at maintaining motivation and enhancing practice
skills. However, to ensure an increase in uptake, monthly teleconfer-
ences and site visits by trainers and study personnel were conducted,
together with the therapists being supported by an administrator in
completing and submitting trial-related paperwork.
Clinical responsibility remained with the clusters.
Treatment as usual
TAU included any treatment approach that is available to commu-
nity intellectual disability teams within the National Health Service.
Most services in England employ a variety of health and social care
professionals, and patients have access to behavioural, psychosocial
and pharmacological interventions, e.g. physical health checks,
simple behavioural modification, and prescribing and monitoring
of psychotropic medication. None of those treatments is strongly
evidence based but there is sufficient guidance concerning ‘what
good care looks like’.
All aspects of TAU were also available to the participants in the
intervention arm.
In five cases, it was revealed that trial participants lived in
accommodation where the provider had offered PBS awareness
seminars or employed consultants to advise its care staff on PBS
approaches.
The researchers collected participant demographic information
(gender, age, and ethnicity), level of intellectual disability (measured
by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence; WASI)24 and
carer-reported adaptive behaviour (measured by the short version
of the Adaptive Behaviour Scale25) at baseline. Cause of intellectual
disability was recorded if known. Participants were also screened
for autism using the autism symptom checklist of the Mini
Psychopathology Assessment Scale for Adults with Developmental
Disability (Mini PASADD).26 The postcode of the participant’s
Hassiotis et al
162
 residence was recorded for linkage with the Index of Multiple
Deprivation, obtained via the UK Data Service website.
Follow-up assessments were conducted at 6 and 12 months after
randomisation with a window of ±4 weeks around the due date for
each assessment.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was challenging behaviour measured by the
total ABC-C score (ABC-CT) over 12 months.18 Secondary out-
comes were symptoms of mental disorder (Mini PASADD),26
Community Participation (Guernsey Community Participation
and Leisure Activities Scale),27 Family Carer Burden (Uplift/
Burden
Scale)28
and
Family
Carer
Psychiatric
Morbidity-
GHQ12.29 Paid Carer Burden was measured with the Caregiving
Difficulty Scale-Intellectual Disability.30 Primary and secondary
outcome measures were administered to the family or paid carer
at all three assessment points.
Serious adverse events were defined as events that were life
threatening, resulted in death, hospital admissions/prolongation
of a stay in hospital, and/or persistent or significant disability or
incapacity.
Statistical analysis
The sample size was calculated to detect a difference of 0.45 s.d. in
the primary outcome, ABC-CT score, measured over 12 months,
with 90% power and 5% significance level;21 indicating that a
minimum of 19 clusters and 246 participants were required.
The analysis plan was developed and discussed with the Trial
Management Team and further agreed with the Data Monitoring
and Ethics Committee and the Trial Steering Committee, which
also oversaw the conduct of the study.
Primary outcome
For the ABC-CT score, a three-level random effects regression
model adjusting for baseline ABC-CT score, time period, staff/
patient ratio and effects of clustering by services and repeated mea-
sures within participants was used. This random effects model pro-
vides valid inferences under the assumption that data are missing at
random. The normality assumptions of the residuals were investi-
gated using residual plots. The primary analysis was performed by
two statisticians separately to ensure its accuracy.
Pre-specified patient characteristics that were not balanced
across the arms, and that were potentially related to the primary
outcome, were adjusted for in a supportive analysis.
Secondary outcomes
Similar analyses were conducted for the secondary outcomes using
linear or logistic models, as appropriate for the type of outcome.
Exploratory multivariate analyses
These examined the effect of staff training in PBS on standardised
ABC-CT domains using a three-level multivariate linear regression
model where the standardised domains were considered simultan-
eously within a multivariate framework, allowing for the estimation
of intervention effects for multiple outcomes.
Subgroup analyses
We explored the treatment effect by gender, age groups (categorised
into quartiles), level of intellectual disability, ethnicity, autism spec-
trum disorder and presence of mental disorder.
Sensitivity analyses
The model included two random effects at the service level, one for
each arm.31 The primary analysis model included the predictors of
missingness as covariates with a ‘baseline observation carried
forward’ analysis to include participants with missing values of
the ABC-CT score.
All statistical tests and confidence intervals are two sided.
Statistical analysis was performed using STATA software version
14. All analyses were by intention to treat. Results from all support-
ive analyses are exploratory and presented as estimates with confi-
dence intervals.
Fidelity assessment
An independent reviewer assessed all treatment documentation sub-
mittedby the therapists,includingfunctionalassessment, observational
data, PBS plan and goodness-of-fit checklist using the Behaviour
Intervention Plan Quality Evaluation Scoring Guide II. The tool is
designed to evaluate the quality of behaviour intervention planning.
Plans are classified as weak, underdeveloped, good or superior.
Results
Recruitment took place from 2 June 2013 to 24 November 2014.
Originally, 28 clusters agreed to take part but 5 dropped out prior
to allocation. From the remaining 23 clusters, 11 were allocated to
the intervention and TAU arm and 12 to the TAU-alone arm. In
the 11 intervention clusters, 21 therapists were trained. Of the 382
potential participants that were screened, 246 (64%) consented to
take part. One participant was erroneously consented as she/he
did not meet the ABC-C inclusion threshold, and therefore was
excluded from the analysis. The median number of participants
recruited per cluster was 13 (interquartile range [IQR] 6–14)
(CONSORT flow diagram shown in Fig. 1).
A total of 215 (87%) and 225 (92%) participants completed the
6- and 12-month follow-up, respectively. There was no difference in
attrition between the arms (7% in the intervention and 9% in the
TAU arms, respectively). Table 1 shows the baseline demographic
and clinical characteristics of the participants.
At baseline, the mean ABC-CT score in the intervention arm
was 61.8 (s.d. 27.7) compared with 68.5 (s.d. 29.0) in the TAU
arm. In the intervention arm, ABC-CT reduced to 55.5 (s.d. 32.5)
at 6 months and to 54.0 (s.d. 32.1) at 12 months. The respective
scores in the TAU arm were 60.6 (s.d. 32.6) at 6 months and 59.2
(s.d. 28.8) at 12 months.
The primary model used 439 ABC-CT score measurements
from 233 participants over the two follow-up time points. The inter-
vention was not statistically significant compared with TAU in
terms of the ABC-CT score (adjusted mean difference −2.4; 95%
CI: −8.7, 4.5; P = 0.528). Details are shown in Table 2 and supple-
mentary Fig. 1, available at https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2017.34.
The intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) for the ABC-CT
score at the service level was 0.021 (95% CI: 0.001, 0.286) and for
the repeated measures within participants it was 0.625 (95% CI:
0.542, 0.702).
None of the subgroup analyses showed a significant effect with
treatment; estimates of the intervention effect on subgroups are
shown in Fig. 2.
A series of analyses was undertaken adjusting for (a) area
deprivation, (b) participant or carer respondent, (c) unbalanced
baseline characteristics (ethnicity and participant’s cohabitant),
(d) percentage of participants within each cluster who had at least
one element of the intervention, (e) a model including two
random effects and (f) imputing missing values with baseline

 observation carried forward. All analyses showed non-significant
results with differences in ABC-CT score between arms ranging
from −3.4 to −0.8. None of the participant baseline data predicted
missing data and, therefore, no further analyses were conducted
(supplementary Table 1).
Multivariate analysis examined the effect of the intervention on
the individual domains of the ABC-C. The inappropriate speech
domain was not included in the multivariate model as it had low
correlations (ρ = 0.300, 0.094, 0.175, 0.360) with the (a) irritability,
agitation, and crying; (b) lethargy and social withdrawal; (c) stereo-
typic behaviour; and (d) hyperactivity and non-compliance
domains, respectively. The intervention had no significant effect
on all four domains (supplementary Table 1).
Regarding the secondary outcomes, there were no differences
between the arms for mental ill health or frequency of community
activities over 12 months. In total, 69 family carers were included
in the study, 19 in the intervention arm and 50 in the TAU arm.
The majority (n = 59, 86%) were female with a median age of
54 years (IQR 48–59). Because of the small numbers in the interven-
tion arm, only descriptive analyses were undertaken. A total of
175 paid carers took part in the study, 89 in the intervention arm
and 86 in the TAU arm. Two thirds (n = 108, 67%) were female
with a median age of 41 years (IQR 32–53). Over the 12 months,
86 (49%) of the paid carers changed (49 in the TAU arm and 37
in the intervention arm, respectively) and therefore no further ana-
lyses were carried out (supplementary Table 2).
Psychotropic medication
A total of 63% of participants in the intervention arm and 65% in the
control arm were receiving antipsychotic medication by the end of
the study. The respective proportions of other psychotropic applica-
tions were 72 and 76%, respectively. The proportions of participants
on antipsychotics and other psychotropic medications remained
stable across the two arms over the study duration.
Serious adverse events
A total of 29 participants experienced 45 serious adverse events
unrelated to the intervention, which were mainly admissions to hos-
pital for a variety of physical ailments and one death. Of these

 serious adverse events, 26 occurred in the intervention arm and 19
in the TAU arm.
Thirteen participants (3 in the intervention arm and 10 in the
TAU arm) moved from their original address to a new home,
either due to closures of previous accommodation or to changes
in the participants’ needs.
Fidelity of intervention and implementation
Of the 26 trained therapists, 8 left the study due to long-term illness,
maternity leave, sabbatical or job changes. Out of a possible 108
intervention reports, 33 included all elements, i.e. functional assess-
ment, observational data, PBS plan, and goodness-of-fit checklist.
Forty-seven included one to three elements, and for 28 participants
there was no submitted paperwork due to the person being not seen,
participant’s refusal to work with the therapist, not presenting with
challenging behaviour at the time of contact, therapist citing lack of
time to take on work relating to the study, and a PBS plan having
been devised by external providers. The PBS plans included the fol-
lowing domains: ‘welcome to my PBS plan’, ‘understanding my
behaviours’, ‘days that I like’, ‘primary prevention’, ‘secondary pre-
vention’, ‘reactive strategies’, and ‘evaluation and review’ setting the
time frame for plan review, usually within 4–6 months.
The available PBS plans were rated as weak by the independent
assessor. Weak plans may lead to a change in the identified behav-
iour, but they lack several of the following: a functional analysis,
range of interventions, modelling new approaches and specifying
environmental
changes
that
maintain
behaviour.
Over
a
30-month period, the study administrator made weekly to twice-
weekly phone calls to the therapists, each intervention site was
visited twice, and 22 teleconferences were convened that were
attended by 0–4 therapists and local investigators in addition to trai-
ners and administrators/other study personnel. The therapists rated
the training and mentoring arrangements highly, but several
reported organisational difficulties, e.g. with obtaining overtime
pay for study-related work, dissatisfaction with study-related
amount of work in addition to overall caseload, participant not
having challenging behaviour or high turnover of paid carers
which impeded plan implementation.

Clinical outcomes of staff training in positive behaviour support to reduce challenging behaviour in adults with intellectual disability
165
 Other aspects
There were six cases of unmasking researchers to the participant’s
trial arm allocation; another researcher collected data from those
sites. Researchers predicted the arm allocation of 123 (59%) and
126 (56%) participants at 6 and 12 months, respectively, which
were not better than chance.
Discussion
The cluster RCT evaluated the clinical outcomes of training health
professionals – who are specialists in working with adults with
intellectual disability – in PBS to reduce challenging behaviour.
It did not detect significant reductions in carer-reported challen-
ging behaviour in the intervention plus TAU arm compared
with the TAU arm alone over 12 months. Secondary outcomes
were also similar between the two arms over 12 months, including
the proportion of participants on psychotropic medication. Given
the high statistical power, the findings suggest that training the
community intellectual disability services staff in PBS, as delivered
in this study, was no more effective than TAU in reducing challen-
ging behaviour.
Strengths and limitations
The study has several strengths, including recruitment of the
required
number
of
participants,
testing
a
single
primary
outcome, achieving a low attrition rate and an a priori analysis
plan, which are indicators of a reduced risk of bias. The ICC for
the primary outcome is smaller than that which was originally
assumed. To guard against the tendency of the impact of training
to dissipate over time, we set up long-term mentoring and peer
support32 as discussed previously. Adjusting for differences in par-
ticipant characteristics at baseline in the main analysis had no
bearing on study outcomes.
The study also has limitations, including the less-than-optimal
delivery of the intervention. Of the participants, 30% (33/108)
received all elements of the PBS approach as specified in the train-
ing, and 43.5% received only partial input which was mainly initial
observations. Although not all services were able to manage a reduc-
tion in the caseloads of therapists, some staff also found the amount
of time spent on study-related work to be too onerous. This may be a
reflection of the realities of implementing PBS within community
intellectual disability services without additional resources, such
as specific posts for accredited behavioural therapists.
It could be argued that gradual adoption of PBS-based care in
some of the clusters in the TAU arm over the study duration may
have reduced any differential between the trial arms. However, we
explicitly excluded teams that employed PBS specialists or specialist
teams. This was confirmed by a survey of the clusters prior to the
study
commencing
that
explored
pre-existing
behavioural
approaches, training, and resources in each cluster. The previous
pilot trial17 examined a specialist team that included highly moti-
vated and trained behavioural specialists. Therefore, the short dur-
ation of training in this study may have been less than optimal in
generating confidence in the therapists to deliver a highly
complex intervention. Further, because therapists found that
some participants did not present with challenging behaviour at
the time of contact, the therapists did not initiate any of the inter-
vention procedures. This may be accounted for by the course of
challenging behaviour which has a remitting–relapsing nature.
Comparisons with existing literature
To the best of our knowledge, MacDonald and McGill33 conducted
the only systematic review to date on outcomes of training staff in
PBS. The authors concluded that the training of paid care staff
increases their competence in managing challenging behaviour
and reduces the use of restrictive practices and reliance on other
professional support, but does not improve participant quality of
life. However, none of the included studies used a randomised
or quasi-randomised design and follow-up was limited to
6 months. Therefore, previously reported significant effects of
staff training in PBS on challenging behaviour are likely due to
study bias.34 This study did not measure staff skills or knowledge,
hence any improvements in those aspects as a consequence of
training in PBS were not captured.35,36 Therapists may have
been less confident in carrying out functional analysis, which is
an important element of behavioural approaches; however, multi-
level analysis of n = 1 experimental studies showed that functional
analysis does not moderate the relationship between an interven-
tion and its impact on challenging behaviour. Consequently, such
an omission is unlikely to have significantly affected participant
outcomes.33
McClean and Grey37 carried out a 26-month follow-up of a
5-year rolling training in PBS of paid carers. They found that
no specific components of PBS plans were associated with reduc-
tions in challenging behaviour. Therefore, even though the plans
in this study were rated as weak, they may have had little influence
on overall improvements in behaviour. An issue remains, though,
as to what are the specific ingredients that would provide added
benefit to routine clinical care, given the resource-intensive task
of drawing up plans and their subsequent application over time.
Other researchers have begun to investigate mindfulness-based
PBS training to reduce restrictive practices, improve staff job sat-
isfaction and reduce challenging behaviour in care homes.38
As is evident from examining the median scores of the primary
outcome, there was a reduction in challenging behaviour for the
majority of participants in both arms. Offering training in PBS
beyond what is already available within community intellectual
disability services does not provide added benefits in reducing
challenging behaviour, use of psychotropic medication, or com-
munity engagement. Future studies, drawing from psychotherapy
research in mental health39 should investigate the relative role of
setting, participant, therapist and organisational characteristics
which underlie any treatment effects found. Finally, identification
and evaluation of other treatment approaches are long overdue.
