Background.
Vaccination and passive antibody therapies are critical for controlling infectious diseases. Passive antibody admin-
istration has limitations, including the necessity for purification and multiple injections for efficacy. Vaccination is associated with a
lag phase before generation of immunity. Novel approaches reported here utilize the benefits of both methods for the rapid gener-
ation of effective immunity.
Methods.
A novel antibody-based prophylaxis/therapy entailing the electroporation-mediated delivery of synthetic DNA plas-
mids encoding biologically active anti–chikungunya virus (CHIKV) envelope monoclonal antibody (dMAb) was designed and eval-
uated for antiviral efficacy, as well as for the ability to overcome shortcomings inherent with conventional active vaccination and
passive immunotherapy.
Results.
One intramuscular injection of dMAb produced antibodies in vivo more rapidly than active vaccination with an anti-
CHIKV DNAvaccine. This dMAb neutralized diverse CHIKV clinical isolates and protected mice from viral challenge. Combination
of dMAb and the CHIKV DNA vaccine afforded rapid and long-lived protection.
Conclusions.
A DNA-based dMAb strategy induced rapid protection against an emerging viral infection. This method can be
combined with DNA vaccination as a novel strategy to provide both short- and long-term protection against this emerging infectious
disease. These studies have implications for pathogen treatment and control strategies.

Active vaccination and passive immunotherapy rank among the
greatest medical achievements. However, improvements in
these immune-based medical interventions are required. This
article describes a novel strategy to develop short- and long-
term protective immunity against chikungunya virus (CHIKV)
infection, using a relevant emerging infectious disease model.
CHIKV is a mosquito-borne RNA pathogen that has infected
millions [1, 2]. A precipitous increase in cases of CHIKV infec-
tion and disease has been recently reported [3, 4], along with an
increase in morbidity and mortality, suggesting increased viru-
lence [5,6].These findings underscore the importance for devel-
oping anti-CHIKV prophylaxis and therapies [1, 7]. To date,
however, no CHIKV vaccine has been licensed, although a vari-
ety of strategies are being evaluated [8–13]. Importantly, anti-
CHIKV neutralizing antibody titers may be a protective immune
correlate [14–16]. Passive immunotherapy has been an impor-
tant short-term intervention against several infectious diseases,
including monoclonal antibody (mAb) prophylaxis against re-
spiratory syncytial virus [17].However, passive antibody delivery
has limitations because of the short half-life of immunoglobulins
[18–21].
Conventional vaccines typically require a lag phase before an-
tibody generation, in addition to multiple immunizations, to be
effective [18, 22]. Furthermore, vaccination-induced protection
can be problematic in some populations (ie, immunocompro-
mised individuals), limiting immune control of infection out-
breaks in these groups. The rapid local spread of CHIKV
underscores the importance of conferring effective and timely
immune protection [7, 23]. While a passive antibody therapy
strategy is an attractive method for a short-term intervention
against viruses such as CHIKV [2, 14, 24], the cost, production
complexity, and cold chain requirements limit this approach.
Therefore, the development of novel immunotherapeutic/prophy-
lactic modalities that overcome these limitations is warranted.
One such strategy is the in vivo delivery of expression plasmids
encoding genes for the immunoglobulin chains of established
functional mAbs. This approach bypasses conventional antibody

 production and may present unique opportunities for therapy, in-
cluding combination with vaccines.
Our group has recently described an in vivo–delivery method
that involves electroporation of DNA plasmids encoding mAb
(designated dMAb), rather than viral vectors [25]. Compared
with viral vector–mediated platforms (ie, adeno-associated
viral vectors) for mAb delivery [26, 27], naked DNA plasmids
represent a nonlive, nonintegrating, and noninfectious platform
that does not generate antivector immunity [28–30]. Accord-
ingly, it may have advantages for rapid antibody production
and readministration because of the lack of serological interfer-
ence often encountered with conventional immune-based
strategies.
In this study, we demonstrate that in vivo production and
delivery of a CHIKV dMAb derived from an established anti-
CHIKV envelope (Env) human neutralizing mAb resulted in
seroconversion, which could protect against lethal in vivo
viral challenge. The effectiveness of dMAb delivery, when coad-
ministered with a CHIKV Env antigen–based DNAvaccine, was
also evaluated. This combination approach resulted in both
short- and long-term protection from lethal CHIKV challenge.
This strategy may have implications against CHIKV and other
infectious diseases.
METHODS
Construction and Expression of CHIKV Specific dMAbs
Gene sequence information for an established anti–Env-specific
CHIKV neutralizing human mAb were obtained from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information database [23].
Human embryonic kidney 293T cells and Vero cells, used for
expression confirmation studies, were maintained as described
previously [12]. The variable heavy (VH) and variable light
(VL) chain segments for the CHIKV Env dMAb preparation
were generated by using synthetic oligonucleotides with several
modifications and were constructed as either a full-length
immunoglobulin G (IgG; designated “CVM1-IgG”) or Fab
fragment (designated “CVM1-Fab”) [31]. For cloning of
CVM1-IgG, a single open reading frame was assembled contain-
ing the heavy and light chain genes, separated by a furin cleavage
site coupled with a P2A self-processing peptide sequence. This
transgene was cloned into the pVax1 expression vector [31].
The CVM1-Fab VH and VL chains were cloned into separate
pVax1 vectors. For tissue culture transfection, 100 μg of pVax1
DNA, CVM1-IgG, or CVM1-Fab (100 μg of each VH and VL
construct) was used. The CHIKV Env–based DNA vaccine
used in the study was developed and characterized as previously
described [11, 12].
CHIKV dMAb Generated IgG Quantification and Binding Assays
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed
with sera, collected and measured in duplicate, from mice admin-
istered CMV1-IgG or pVax1, to quantify expression kinetics and
target antigen binding. These measurements and analyses were
performed as previously described [32].
Western Blot and Immunofluorescence Analysis of dMAb-Generated
IgG
For Western blot analysis of IgG expression CHIKV (viral
isolate PC08) infected cells were lysed two days post infection
and evaluated by previously published methods [12,32].For im-
munofluorescence analysis, chamber slides (Nalgene Nunc,
Penfield, New York) were seeded with Vero cells (1 × 104) and
infected for 2 hours with the viral isolate CHIKV PC08 at a
multiplicity of infection of 1. Immunofluorescence analysis
was performed as previously described [32], with slides being
visually evaluated by confocal microscopy (LSM710; Carl
Zeiss). The resulting images were semiquantitatively analyzed
using Zen software (Carl Zeiss).
dMAb DNA Plasmid Administration and In Vivo Analysis
CVM1-Fab and CVM1-IgG expression kinetics and functional-
ity were evaluated in B6.Cg-Foxn1nu/J mice (Jackson Laborato-
ry) following intramuscular injection of 100 μg control pVax1,
CVM1-IgG, or 100 μg of each plasmid chain of CVM1-Fab. For
studies that include the DNA vaccine, 25 μg of the CHIKV Env
plasmid were injected 3 times at 2-week intervals. All injections
were followed immediately by delivery of CHIKV dMAb DNA
plasmid via electroporation [25,32,33]. Animal studies were ap-
proved by the Committee on Animal Care, University of
Pennsylvania.
CHIKV Challenge Study
BALB/c mice received a single (100 μg) electroporation-
enhanced intramuscular injection of CVM1-IgG, CMV-Fab
(VH and VL), or control pVax1 plasmids. The CHIKV Env
DNA vaccine was delivered as described above. Two or 35
days after DNA delivery, mice were challenged with 107 pla-
que-forming units (25 μL) of the viral isolate CHIKV Del-03
(JN578247) [34] either subcutaneously (in the dorsal side of
each hind foot) or intranasally [12]. Mouse foot swelling (height
by breadth) was measured daily up to 14 days after infection. In
addition, the animals were monitored daily (for up to 20 days
after infection) for survival and signs of infection (ie, changes
in body weight and lethargy). Animals losing >30% of their
body mass were euthanized, and serum samples were collected
for cytokine quantification and other immune analysis. Blood
samples were collected from the tail on days 7–14 after infec-
tion, and viremia levels were measured by a plaque assay.
Neutralizing Antibody Analysis
Anti-CHIKV neutralizing antibody titers from mice adminis-
tered CVM1-IgG were determined by previously described
methods [10, 12], using Vero cells infected with the following
CHIKV isolates: LR2006-OPY1 (Indian Ocean Outbreak),
IND-63WB1 and SL-CH1 (Asian-clade), Ross (ECSA-clade),
and PC08 and DRDE-06 (ECSA-clade). Neutralization titers

 were calculated as the reciprocal of the highest dilution mediat-
ing 100% reduction of the cytopathic effects in the Vero cell
monolayer. Data were generated and statistical analyses per-
formed using the GraphPad Prism 5 software package (Graph-
Pad Software). Nonlinear regression fitting with sigmoidal dose
response was used to determine the level of antibody mediating
50% inhibition of infection (IC50). CHIKV Env pseudotype
production and fluorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS)
analysis were performed as described previously [35].
Cytokine Quantitative Analysis
Sera were collected from mice injected with CVM1-Fab, CVM1-
IgG, or CHIKV Env, as well as those challenged with CHIKV (1
week after challenge). Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), inter-
leukin 1β (IL-1β), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels in sera were
measured using ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions (R&D Systems).
Statistical Analysis
A Student t test or a nonparametric Spearman correlation test
were performed using GraphPad Prism software (Prism, La
Jolla, California). Correlations between the variables in the con-
trol and experimental groups were statistically evaluated using
the Spearman rank correlation test, with P values of <.05 con-
sidered to be statistically significant for all tests.
RESULTS
Anti-CHIKV dMAbs Design and Confirmation of Expression
Viral entry into host cells by CHIKV is mediated by Env, against
which the majority of neutralizing antibodies are generated [12,
36]. Thus, a DNA plasmid (dMAb) expressing the light and
heavy immunoglobulin chains of a neutralizing anti-CHIKV
mAb recognizing both E1 and E2 Env proteins was designed
[23, 24]. The complementary DNAs for the coding sequences of
the VL and VH immunoglobulin chains for full-length anti-
CHIKV dMAb were optimized for increased expression and
cloned into a pVax1 vector, using previously described methods
[25, 31]. For the constructs expressing anti–CHIKV-Fab, the VH
and VL genes were cloned separately. The optimized synthetic plas-
mids constructed from the anti-Env–specific CHIKV-neutralizing
mAb were designated CVM1-IgG or CVM1-Fab, for the IgG
and Fab antibodies, respectively. Human 293T cells were trans-
fected with either the CVM1-IgG plasmid or the CVM1-Fab
(VL, VH, or combined) plasmids to validate expression in
vitro. As indicated in Figure 1A and 1B , anti-CHIKV antibody

(subtype B; MN) envelope protein, and sera obtained on day 15 from mice given a single injection of CVM1-IgG, CVM1-Fab, or pVax1 were tested. For A, B and D mean
OD450 values are shown ±SD.

 levels were measured by ELISA with recombinant CHIKV Env
used asthe binding antigen. These data indicate that the CVM1-Fab
and CVM1-IgG expressed antibodies in the muscle that appeared to
be properly assembled and biologically functional in vitro.
In Vivo Expression and Quantification of CVM1-IgG and CVM1-Fab
Following confirmation of in vitro expression, the ability of
CVM1-Fab or CVM1-IgG to produce anti-CHIKV antibodies
in vivo was measured. B6.Cg-Foxn1nu/J mice aged 5–6 weeks
were administered 100 μg of CVM1-IgG (CVM1-IgG is 1 plas-
mid), 100 μg each of CVM1 VH and VL (CVM1-Fab consists of
2 plasmids), or control vector by a single intramuscular electro-
poration-mediated injection. Sera were collected at indicated
time points, and target antigen binding was measured by IgG
quantification, using ELISA. Although mAbs generated from
CVM1-Fab appeared more rapidly (ie, within 3 days after in-
jection) than those from CVM1-IgG, both constructs generated
similar mAb levels by day 15 (mean sera levels [±SD],
1587.23 ± 73.23 ng/mL of CVM1-Fab and 1341.29 ± 82.07 ng/
mL of CVM1-IgG; Figure 1C). Mice were administered either
CVM1-IgG or CVM1-Fab, and sera antibody levels were eval-
uated through a binding ELISA. Sera collected 15 days after
injection from both CVM1-IgG and CVM1-Fab bound to
CHIKV Env protein but not to an unrelated control antigen,
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Env (Figure 1D).
These data indicate that in vivo produced anti-CHIKV antibod-
ies from CVM1-IgG or CVM1-Fab constructs have similar bi-
ological characteristics to conventionally produced antigen
specific antibodies.
In Vivo Specificity and Broadly Neutralizing Activity in Sera From Mice
Injected With CVM1-IgG
The anti-CHIKV dMAb generated mAbs were tested for bind-
ing specificity and anti-CHIKV neutralizing activity. Sera from
mice injected with CVM1-IgG were tested against fixed CHIKV
PC08–infected Vero cells by immunofluorescence assays.
The results indicated binding of the sera antibodies to the
CHIKV-infected cells (Figure 2A). Confirmation of binding of
sera from CVM1-IgG–injected mice to target proteins was
tested by Western blot analysis. The detection of CHIKV E2 pro-
tein (50 kDa) expression in total cell lysate from the CHIKV-
infected cells indicates specificity of CVM1-IgG expression
(Figure 2B). The specificity of in vivo–produced CVM1-IgG anti-
body was further demonstrated through FACS analysis against
cells infected with green fluorescent protein–encoded CHIKV
(Figure 2C). Moreover, CVM1-Fab binding, demonstrated by im-
munohistochemical analysis and FACS analysis, was similar to
that of the generated full-length CVM1-IgG (data not shown). To-
gether, these findings indicate a strong specificity of the antibody
generated from the CVM1-IgG plasmid.
Furthermore, the anti-CHIKV neutralizing activity in sera
from mice that received CVM1-IgG was measured against
that in 6 divergent CHIKV strains: LR2006-OPY1 (Indian
Ocean Outbreak), IND-63WB1 (Asian-clade), Ross (ECSA-
clade), PC08 (ECSA-clade), SL-CH1 (Asian-clade) and
DRDE-06 (ECSA-clade) [37]. IC50 values were determined
for each viral isolate. Sera from CVM1-IgG–injected mice effec-
tively neutralized all 6 CHIKV isolates, demonstrating that
a single injection can produce significant neutralizing levels
of human anti-CHIKV IgG in mice (Figure 2D). Similar
results were observed using sera from CVM1-Fab–injected
mice (data not shown). These data indicate that antibodies
produced in vivo by CVM1-IgG constructs have relevant
biological activity (ie, binding and neutralizing activity against
CHIKV).
CVM1-IgG Injection Protects Mice From Lethal CHIKV Challenge
Previous studies demonstrated that early immunity against
viruses is a key factor for controlling infections [22, 38, 39].
To determine whether antibodies generated from CVM1-IgG
or CVM1-Fab provide protection against early exposure to
CHIKV, groups of 10 mice received a single administration of
pVax1, CVM1-IgG, or CVM1-Fab on day 0. Each group subse-
quently was challenged subcutaneously with virus on day 2 to
mimic natural CHIKV infection (Figure 3A). Animal survival
and weight changes were subsequently recorded for 20 days. All
mice injected with pVax1 control plasmid died within a week of
viral challenge. Conversely, 100% survival was observed in mice ad-
ministered either CVM1-IgG or CVM1-Fab, compared with 0%
survival among mice that received pVax1 plasmid (P = .0033),
demonstrating that CVM1-IgG and CVM1-Fab plasmids confer
protective immunity within 2 days after delivery.
The longevity of immune protection was next evaluated. A
second group of mice (n = 10) was challenged with CHIKV
30 days after a single injection with CVM1-IgG, CVM1-Fab,
or pVax1 on day 0 (Figure 3B). Mice were monitored for surviv-
al over the next 20 days. Mice injected with CVM1-Fab or
CVM1-IgG demonstrated 70% and 90% survival, respectively,
compared with no survival among pVax1-injected mice
(P = .0120), indicating that CVM1-IgG provides a more durable
degree of immune protection (Figure 3B).
To assess the ability of the CVM1-IgG plasmid to protect
against infection at a mucosal surface, the protective efficacy
of CVM1-IgG against subcutaneous versus intranasal viral chal-
lenge, previously demonstrated to produce visible CHIKV path-
ogenesis such as limb muscle weakness, footpad swelling,
lethargy, and high mortality within 6–10 days of infection,
was evaluated [12, 40]. For simplicity, studies focused on the
CVM1-IgG construct. Groups of 20 mice received a single ad-
ministration of pVax1 or CVM1-IgG, with half (ie, 10) being
challenged with CHIKV via a subcutaneous or intranasal
route 2 days after injection. CVM1-IgG protected mice from
both subcutaneous viral challenge (P = .0024; Figure 3C) and
intranasal viral challenge (P = .0073; Figure 3D), compared
with pVax1-injected mice, demonstrating that it can protect
against systemic and mucosal infection.

 Comparison Between In Vivo Protective Immunity Conferred by
CHIKV-IgG Administration and CHIKV Env DNA Vaccination
A study comparing the protective efficacy of CVM1-IgG admin-
istration vs a CHIKV Env–expressing DNAvaccine (CHIKV Env)
was next performed. A novel consensus-based DNA vaccine was
developed by our laboratory and was capable of providing protec-
tion against CHIKV challenge in mice. The DNA vaccine also in-
duced both measurable cellular immune responses, as well as
potent neutralizing antibody responses in rhesus macaques [11,
12]. Groups of mice were administered a single injection of
CVM1-IgG, CHIKV Env, or the pVax1, followed by viral chal-
lenge on 2 days after injection. Mice that received a single immu-
nization of CHIKV Env or pVax1 died within 6 days of viral
challenge, whereas a single immunization of CVM1-IgG provided
100% protection (Figure 4A). CVM1-IgG clearly conferred
protective immunity more rapidly than the CHIKV Env DNA
vaccine (P = .0026).
Next, a long-term CHIKV challenge protection study was
performed on day 35 following vaccination with the CHIKV
Env DNA vaccine or administration of CVM1-IgG on day
0. The multibooster delivery of the CHIKV Env DNA vaccine
conferred 100% protection (Figure 4B), while 80% survival
was observed in mice administered CVM1-IgG (P = .0007).
The kinetics of the induced antibody responses was measurable
within 2 days of a single injection of CVM1-IgG, with peak lev-
els by day 15 (approximately 1400 ng/mL) and detectable mAb
levels maintained for at least 45 days after injection (Supple-
mentary Figure 1A). Although there is continued expression,
these levels are decreased, compared with peak levels, support-
ing the partial protection noted in the experiment (Figure 4B).

Binding analyses and neutralization activity of CVM1–immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. A, An immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that IgG generated from
CVM1-IgG–administered mice was capable of binding to chikungunya virus (CHIKV) envelope protein (Env). CHIKV-infected Vero cells were fixed 24 hours after infection and
evaluated by an immunofluorescence assay to detect CHIKV Env antigen expression (green). Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Sera from control mice injected with
pVax1 were used as a negative control. B, The binding affinity of sera from CVM1-IgG–injected mice (day 15) to target proteins was tested by Western blot, using cell lysates
from CHIKV- or mock-infected cells as described in “Materials and Methods” section. Protein transferred membranes were reprobed with antibody against β-actin was used as
a loading control. The image presented here was cropped from an original image and is representative of several gels. C, Fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis of the
binding of sera from plasmid-injected mice to CHIKV-infected cells. The x-axis indicates green fluorescent protein (GFP) staining, using the lentiviral GFP pseudovirus com-
plemented with CHIKV Env. The y-axis demonstrates staining of infected cells by human IgG produced in mice 15 days after injection with CVM1-IgG. Staining with a control
anti-CHIKV antibody (Env antibody) is also shown, as well as staining with no antibodies and pVax1. The presence and number of double-positive cells indicate presence and
level of sera binding to the CHIKV-infected cells. D, Sera from mice injected with CVM1-IgG via electroporation possess neutralizing activity against multiple CHIKV strains (ie,
Ross, LR2006-OPY1, IND-63-WB1, PC-08, DRDE-06, and SL-CH1). Neutralizing antibody titers are plotted, and 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values; parenthesis) were
calculated with Prism GraphPad software. Similar results were observed in 2 independent experiments with at least 10 mice per group for each experiment.

 Codelivery of CVM1-IgG and the CHIKV Env DNAVaccine Produces Systemic
Humoral Immunity, Cell-Mediated Immunity, and Protection In Vivo
One potential issue of combining antibody delivery with vacci-
nation approaches is that the antibodies can neutralize many
traditional vaccines [12, 25, 32, 41] and thus are incompatible
platforms. The effect of coadminstration of CVM1-IgG and
CHIKV Env on mouse survival in the context of CHIKV chal-
lenge was also evaluated. In this experiment, 20 mice were ad-
ministered at day 0 a single dose of CVM1-IgG and 3 doses of
CHIKV Env DNA as described above. Subsequently, half of the
animals were challenged with CHIKV at day 2 and the other
half at day 35. Survival in these groups was followed as a func-
tion of time. Not unexpectedly, both of the challenge groups
had 100% long-term survival (Figure 4C). Specifically, results
of the day 2 CHIKV challenge experiment indicated the utility
of the CVM1-IgG reagent in mediating protection from infec-
tion, with the survival percentage decreasing to approximately
30% by 4 days after challenge in control (pVax1) animals. Fig-
ure 4D indicates levels of anti-CHIKV IgG, by time, generated
in mice that received CVM1-IgG and CHIKV Env DNA vac-
cine; anti-CHIKV human IgG represents antibody produced
by the CVM1-IgG plasmid and anti-CHIKV mouse IgG repre-
sents antibody induced by the CHIKV Env vaccine. Both
human IgG and mouse IgG were detected and exhibited differ-
ent expression kinetics. By 3 days after initial CHIKV Env DNA
vaccination, mouse anti-Env antibody levels were essentially
near 0 (mouse anti-CHIKV IgG). Conversely, 3 days after a
single CVM1-IgG injection, human anti-Env antibody levels
were significant (human anti-CHIKV IgG). These data under-
score the importance of CVM1-IgG in mediating rapid protec-
tion from infection and death after CHIKV challenge.
Furthermore, T-cell responses induced in animals injected
with CVM1-IgG, CHIKV Env, or CVM1-IgG plus CHIKV
Env was evaluated by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunospot
Figure 3.
Characterization of in vivo immune protection conferred by CVM1-Fab and CVM1–immunoglobulin G (IgG). As described in the schematic representation for each
panel, BALB/c mice were injected with 100 μg of pVax1 (negative control), CVM1-IgG, CVM1–variable heavy chain, and CVM1–variable light chain on day 0 and challenged on
day 2 (A) or day 30 (B) with chikungunya virus (CHIKV) as described in “Materials and Methods” section. Mice were monitored daily, and survival rates were recorded for 20
days after viral challenge. C and D, Protection of mice from different routes of CHIKV challenge. Two groups of mice were injected with 100 μg of CVM1-IgG by the intra-
muscular route, followed by viral challenge on day 2 with either subcutaneous (C) or intranasal (D) inoculation. Mice were monitored daily, and survival rates were recorded for
20 days after the viral challenge. The black arrow indicates plasmid injections; the red arrow indicates the time of viral challenge. Each group consisted of 10 mice, and the
results were representative of 2 independent experiments. P values for statistical comparisons between appropriate groups are indicated in panels A–D.

 assay, which measures IFN-γ levels (Supplementary Figure 1B).
CHIKV Env elicited strong T-cell responses irrespective of code-
livery with CVM1-IgG, showing the lack of interference of these
approaches. Conversely, animals administered only CVM1-IgG
did not develop T-cell responses, as would be expected. These
findings demonstrate that both CVM1-IgG and CHIKV Env
DNA vaccine can be administered simultaneously without recip-
rocal interference, providing immediate and long-lived protec-
tion via systemic humoral and cellular immunity.
CVM1-IgG Administration Reduces CHIKV Loads and Proinflammatory
Cytokine Levels
Previous studies identified molecular correlates of CHIKV-
associated disease severity, including viral load and proinflam-
matory cytokine levels [42, 43]. Thus, the ability of CVM1 IgG
to suppress these disease-associated markers at early and late
time points after viral challenge was assessed. Mice immunized
with CVM1 IgG, CVM1 Fab, CHIKV Env, or CVM1 IgG plus
CHIKV Env DNA vaccine generated mAb and significantly
reduced viral loads (Figure 5A). In addition to viral load reduc-
tion, these mice did not exhibit footpad swelling, compared
with control (pVax1) immunized mice, and consistently gained
body weight during the 20-day experimental period (Figure 5B
and 5C). Also the CVM1-IgG–generated mAb and the CHIKV
Env DNA vaccine exhibited significantly reduced levels
of CHIKV-mediated proinflammatory cytokines (ie, TNF-α,
IL-6, and IL-β), compared with pVax1, 10 days after viral chal-
lenge (Supplementary Figure 2). These findings suggest that a
single injection with CVM1-IgG suppresses CHIKV-associated
pathology to an extent comparable to that induced by protective
vaccination [12].

Comparative and combination studies with CVM1–immunoglobulin G (IgG) and the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) envelope protein (Env) DNA vaccine. Schematic
representation of CVM1-IgG injection and the CHIKV Env DNA vaccination time course and challenge studies are shown for each study. A, BALB/c mice were injected with 100 μg
of CVM1-IgG, 100 μg of pVax1 (negative control), or 25 μg of CHIKV-Env DNA on day 0 and challenged on day 2 with CHIKV Del-03 (JN578247; 1 × 107 plaque-forming units in
a total volume of 25 μL). B, BALB/c mice were administered either a single injection of 100 μg of CVM1-IgG on day 0 or 3 immunizations of 25 μg of CHIKV Env DNA on day 0,
day 14, and day 28 and then challenged on day 35 under the same conditions and with the same CHIKV isolate. C, Groups of 20 BALB/c mice were administered a single 100 μg
injection of CVM1-IgG on day 0 and 3 immunizations with CHIKV-Env DNA (25 μg) on day 0, day 14, and day 28. Half of the mice were then challenged on day 2, and the
remaining half were challenged on day 35 under the same conditions and with the same CHIKV isolate challenge described above. The black arrow indicates plasmid injection,
and the red arrow indicates the time of viral challenge. For each study, mice were monitored for 20 days after challenge, and survival rates were recorded. D, Induction of

 DISCUSSION
Antigen-based vaccination requires a lag period during which the
vaccine recipient remains susceptible to infection and disease [22,
44]. Use of passive antibody therapy has advantages in several
high-risk populations that either respond poorly to active vacci-
nation or manifest significant vaccine-related side effects [45]. It
would be a major advantage to generate effective and specific in
vivo immunity rapidly without the need for repeated administra-
tion of preformed antibodies or a significant lag time for immune
response generation that follows conventional antigen-based
immunization. In this study, a novel, synthetic DNA-delivery
system (dMAb) for generating rapid immune protection was
evaluated using the emerging CHIKV as a model.
The increased incidence and geographic spread of CHIKV
infection and other emerging viral infections raises concerns for
potential global outbreaks, underscoring the need for targeted
antiviral interventions [15, 24]. Currently, neither a vaccine
nor a therapy for CHIKV infection has been licensed [7], but
evidence suggests that humoral immunity plays a critical role
in protecting against CHIKV infection [14, 15, 24]. Our group
previously demonstrated that passive transfer of sera from
mice immunized with a CHIKV Env DNA vaccine protected
naive mice from lethal CHIKV challenge [12], highlighting
the utility of antibody-based therapy, as well as prompting in-
terest in developing a novel approach for providing a source of
anti-CHIKV antibodies generated directly in vivo.
This study demonstrates the utility of electroporation-
mediated delivery of optimized DNA plasmids for the in vivo
rapid production of biologically functional mAbs. Unlike viral
vectors, DNA plasmids do not pose a risk of genome integration
or generate antivector immunity, which allows for booster im-
munizations and co-vaccinations with multiple DNA plasmids

 [32, 46–48]. In addition, they are stable, which facilitates man-
ufacturing and stockpiling and obviates the necessity for a
refrigerated cold chain. The strategy could also be particularly
useful to combat pathogens adept at escaping the immune
response, since multiple plasmids encoding antibodies targeting
different epitopes could be administered without serological
interference [49].
This study demonstrates that mice injected with a single dose
of CVM1 IgG were fully protected from viral challenge 2 days
after administration, whereas no mice survived infection follow-
ing a single immunization with CHIKV Env DNA vaccine,
owing presumably to an insufficient time to mount protective
immunity. However, complete protection was observed with
CHIKV Env after a immunization regimen followed by chal-
lenge at later time points. A similar level of protection occurred
in mice administered a single dose of CVM1-IgG, although pro-
tection waned to 80% over time. Notably, the codelivery of
CVM1-IgG and CHIKV Env produced rapid and persistent
humoral and cellular immunity, suggesting that a combination
approach can have additive or synergistic effects. Importantly,
codelivery of CVM1-IgG and CHIKV Env were not antagonis-
tic in terms of the development of short- or long-term protec-
tive immune responses, providing a new important approach
that provides infection resistance against this relevant pathogen.
These studies likely have importance for a variety of other infec-
tious and noninfectious diseases.
