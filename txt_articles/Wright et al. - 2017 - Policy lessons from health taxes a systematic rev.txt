Policy lessons from health taxes: a
systematic review of empirical studies
Alexandra Wright*, Katherine E. Smith and Mark Hellowell
Abstract
Background: Taxes on alcohol and tobacco have long been an important means of raising revenues for public
spending in many countries but there is increasing interest in using taxes on these, and other unhealthy products,
to achieve public health goals. We present a systematic review of the research on health taxes, and aim to generate
insights into how such taxes can: (i) reduce consumption of targeted products and related harms; (ii) generate
revenues for health objectives and distribute the tax burden across income groups in an efficient and equitable
manner; and (iii) be made politically sustainable.
Methods: Six scientific and four grey-literature databases were searched for empirical studies of ‘health taxes’ –
defined as those intended to increase the costs of manufacturing, distributing, retailing and/or consuming health-
damaging products. Since reviews already exist of the evidence relating to traditional alcohol and tobacco excise
taxes, we focus on other taxes such as taxes on retailers and manufacturers of unhealthy products, and consumer
taxes targeting unhealthy foods, such as sugar-sweetened beverages.
Results: Ninety-one peer-reviewed and 11 grey-literature studies met our inclusion criteria. The review highlights a
recent, rapid rise in research in this area, most of which focuses on high-income countries and on taxes on food
products or nutrients. Findings demonstrate that high tax rates on sugar-sweetened beverages are likely to have a
positive impact on health behaviours and outcomes, and, while taxes on products reduce demand, they add to
fiscal revenues. Common concerns about health taxes are also discussed.
Conclusions: If the primary policy goal of a health tax is to reduce consumption of unhealthy products, then
evidence supports the implementation of taxes that increase the price of products by 20% or more. However,
where taxes are effective in changing health behaviours, the predictability of the revenue stream is reduced. Hence,
policy actors need to be clear about the primary goal of any health tax and frame the tax accordingly – not doing
so leaves taxes vulnerable to hostile lobbying. Conversely, earmarking health taxes for health spending tends to
increase public support so long as policymakers follow through on specified spending commitments.

 Background
Taxes directed at unhealthy products, such as alcohol,
tobacco, certain foods and non-alcoholic beverages (for
example ‘sugar-sweetened beverages’ - ‘SSBs’), are widely
used. Historically, the primary objective of such mea-
sures has been the fiscal revenues they generate. How-
ever, as evidence of the social, economic and health
harms associated with such products has accumulated,
there has been increasing policy and research interest in
the ability of such taxes to raise the cost of manufactur-
ing, distributing, retailing and/or consuming unhealthy
products, and thereby reducing their consumption. In par-
ticular, governments in several countries have employed
taxes on tobacco and alcohol products to promote re-
duced consumption [1]. An international review of pricing
policies and tobacco control in Europe identified extensive
evidence regarding the effects of traditional taxes on
tobacco products (customs duties, excise taxes and value
added taxes), concluding that such taxes represent one of
the most effective means of tobacco control [2]. There is
also a vast amount of literature examining the relation-
ships between product price, alcohol consumption, and
alcohol-related harms. In 2009, for example, Wagenaar
and colleagues published a meta-analysis of 112 studies to
examine the effects of alcohol price on consumption
levels. Again, the authors found a significant inverse
relationship between alcohol taxes or prices and the
consumption of alcohol products; a relationship which
held for both light and heavy drinking patterns [3].
More recently, a number of countries have introduced
new or higher taxes on a broader array of unhealthy
products, or have structured taxes in new ways with the
aim of increasing the cost of manufacturing, distributing,
retailing and/or consuming such products. For example,
since 2010, countries including Denmark, Hungary,
Finland, France, Mexico and the United Kingdom have
introduced sales taxes on foods or beverages deemed un-
healthy; while in Scotland, a ‘public health supplement’
was introduced from 2012 to 2015 on large retailers (in
effect large supermarkets) selling both alcohol and
tobacco [4]. In some of these cases, which are also dis-
cussed in more detail later in this review, the revenues
generated by the tax have been earmarked for specified
health-related spending. Earmarking dedicates specific
revenue to specific purposes, and is sometimes labelled
‘hypothecation’. Although, as we demonstrate, the litera-
ture concerning health taxes currently focuses on high
income country settings, these experiences may be par-
ticularly relevant for low- and middle-income countries,
in which strategies to provide universal health coverage
are, it is increasingly recognized, dependent on the ef-
fective expansion of public sector financial resources [5].
While the use of alcohol and tobacco duties in chan-
ging health behaviours is well-established, we have found
no publications that synthesize the empirical research on
this more recent, broader range of country-specific
‘health taxes’
, as mentioned in the paragraph above. This
paper presents a systematic review of this research with
the aim of providing insights into how such taxes can
be designed to: (i) reduce consumption of targeted
products and related health harms; (ii) generate reve-
nues (especially for health-related purposes, in the
case of earmarked taxes) and distribute the tax burden
across income groups in an efficient and equitable manner
and (iii) be sustained over time in the context of political
constraints.
We begin with an outline of methods and then present
the findings of the review. In the discussion, we consider
the research gaps to be addressed and outline the lessons
for future policymaking in this key area.
Methods
We conducted a systematic search for empirical litera-
ture concerning taxes that are intended to increase the
costs of manufacturing, distributing, retailing and/or
consuming health-damaging products, excluding those
that have already been the subject of systematic reviews
(e.g. customs duties, sales taxes and VAT on alcohol and
tobacco). We specifically considered the impacts of taxes
in relation to the aim of this paper, stated above.
Our aim was to produce a systematic review of evi-
dence relating to non-traditional health taxes that would
be of use to policy audiences considering advocating for,
or developing, new (or higher) health taxes (e.g. civil ser-
vants, politicians and health-focused non-governmental
organisations [NGOs]). Our approach was informed by a
study of how policy actors perceive and use health-
focused systematic reviews (compared to other potential
‘evidence tools’ such as health impact assessments and
cost-benefit analyses) [6]. This study found that policy
actors (for example, national or local policymakers, ad-
vocates and policy campaigners, and knowledge brokers)
were often frustrated by the narrow focus of systematic
reviews, concerned by the number of studies excluded
for quality purposes and the lack of contextual informa-
tion, and disappointed by the dearth of clear policy-
relevant recommendations [6]. In response, this paper
provides a broad overview of what empirical studies have
found about the impacts of ‘health taxes’. Given the
concern raised by policy actors about the exclusion of
potentially useful studies, we did not exclude studies on
the basis of their quality, though we do comment on
quality issues where relevant. The results are organized
according to likely policy questions about health taxes,
and the concluding discussion summarizes the key
policy ‘lessons’ and identifies gaps and limitations in the
evidence-base.

 The search string for this review was developed itera-
tively and finalized collaboratively by the authors. The
baseline search string for peer reviewed journal articles,
which was developed for the PubMed database, was as
follows (* indicates a truncation of the word to include
all forms of that word):
(((health) AND (tobacco OR cigar* OR alcohol OR
drink* OR beer OR wine OR spirits OR made-wine
OR cider OR perry OR food OR soda OR beverage*
OR sugar OR fat OR "sin tax")) AND (tax*[Title/

("taxonomy" OR "syntax" OR "excision" OR
"taxonomic" OR "taxonomically" OR "taxane"
OR "taxi" OR "taxonic" OR parasit* OR
microbial OR phenotyp*)
Databases for this review were selected after consult-
ation with a qualified librarian on the basis of their
scope and relevance. We ultimately included the follow-
ing databases and aggregator sites: PubMed, OVID, Web
of Science, EBSCOhost (including Academic Search
Complete Business Source Complete, SocINDEX with
Full Text, EconLit, and Medline), Scopus, and ProQuest
(including IBSS Online and ASSIA). The baseline search
string was refined for each database, and each individual
search string can be found in Additional file 1. The first
search was conducted in September 2015 with timeline
1990-2015. An updated search was conducted in May
2016, with timeline September 2015-May 2016. At this
time, we also conducted grey literature searches in
Google, the WHO website, and four grey literature data-
bases (NBER, Global Health, Open Grey, and HISA), for
the period 2000-2016.
We obtained all citations and reviewed the abstracts
and full texts for relevance. Articles were included if
they: (1) reported empirical data on the design, imple-
mentation, or impacts of health taxes that target un-
healthy products (other than traditional tobacco and
alcohol excise, already well-reviewed, or import/export
duties, for reasons of feasibility); or (2) reported on em-
pirical data (including data generated via modelling, e.g.
of the likely responses of affected stakeholders to health
taxes).
Studies were excluded from this review if they focused
on: (1) behaviour changes caused by proportional taxes
on the sale, or production for sale, of health damaging
products that have already been the focus of systematic
reviews (i.e. studies of consumer taxes on tobacco and
alcohol products); (2) import/export duties applied to
particular products where these did not have any clear
health-related content or rationale; (3) quantifying the
costs relating to any particular products/behaviours (for
consideration for tax purposes) but not actually asses-
sing health taxes; or (4) combined or linked interven-
tions in which taxation was implemented alongside
other kinds of intervention (and could not be separated
for analysis). We also excluded publications that are not
based on empirical data; (e.g. opinion pieces) and those
not written in English (since no other languages were
available to the research team). Publications focusing on
import/export duties were excluded because they are
strongly influenced by macro factors in the political
economy (e.g. international trade agreements), making it
difficult to ascertain their link to national public health
concerns - our focus remains on taxation decisions by
national governments to improve public health.
A data extraction matrix was developed in Microsoft
Excel and utilized to compile the review data. The
authors jointly undertook article screening and data
extraction, and any uncertainties were discussed by the
research team collectively. The reference lists of each
article were examined for snowballing purposes which,
as summarized below, led to the identification of five
additional studies.
With a policy focus in mind, our approach to synthe-
sizing the large and diverse literature was informed by
the following five key questions, which our background
research (initial literature review and conversations with
relevant policy actors) suggested are of interest to policy
audiences considering new (or additional) health taxes:
1) How (if at all) do particular health taxes change
consumption behaviours and what do we know
about the health-related impacts of such taxes?
2) Can health taxes on manufacturers and retailers
change behaviours?
3) Do taxes that target health-damaging products
succeed in providing additional fiscal revenue?
4) What is the degree of support among public and
policy communities for non-traditional health taxes
and are there means of increasing support?
5) What are the key critiques of health taxes and their
implementation and what options exist to manage
these challenges?
Results
Bibliographic results of literature search
We identified 102 relevant studies (91 peer-reviewed
journal articles and 11 non peer-reviewed publications),
as summarized in Fig. 1.
As Fig. 2 summarizes, included studies largely focused
on the impacts of health taxes on behavioural change, or
on public health (including, in one case, the social deter-
minants of health), with a smaller number of studies
considering public opinion and issues relating to tax
design and implementation, and media coverage.

 The studies we identified focused on a range of high-
income countries, and a smaller number of middle-
income countries. The literature is dominated by studies
of health taxes implemented in the US (51 studies)
(see Fig. 3) and Europe (34 studies, either focusing on
the European region as a whole or individual European
countries), though this spread inevitably reflects our
exclusion of non-English language articles.
As Fig. 4 summarizes, the empirical research methods
utilized in the included articles most commonly involved
modelling (n = 54), although we also identified evaluation
studies (n = 16), experiments (n = 10), public opinion
surveys (n = 9), and alternative qualitative approaches (e.g.
interviews, media analyses, citizen’s juries) (n = 11). We
also identified two studies that employed mixed methods:
one mixed modelling with evaluation and the other
employed a mixed quantitative-qualitative approach.
The majority of included studies focus on taxes on
food or beverage products. Figure 5 shows the number
of included studies published in each year, with respect
to the category of product targeted (note that, where an
article focused on both food and beverages it was
included in both categories, and hence the number of
publications in Fig. 5 exceeds the number of included
studies). This demonstrates that interest in this area
seems to be increasing, with a particularly marked
increase in studies of beverage taxes from 2010 onwards.
The majority of modeling studies estimated price elas-
ticities based upon empirical data drawn from a number
of existing sources, including: (i) national survey data,
such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey [NHANES] in the United States; the National
Food Survey of Great Britain; or the Living Costs and
Food Survey, also in the UK); (ii) other public data such
as price data from the National Institute of Statistics and
Geography in Mexico; and (iii) data collected by private

 research companies, such as the Nielsen Homescan Panel
(e.g. in the UK, US and Australia). Two modeling studies
used simulated cohorts: Gortmaker and colleagues [7]
used a simulated cohort representative of the 2015 US
population, and Zhang and colleagues [8] developed a
simulation model to represent an adult population in
California (which itself drew from a national survey and
other empirical research).
We acknowledge that certain context-specific factors
will influence how clearly a tax is visible to the consumer,
and this is likely to have an important influence on how
consumers respond. In the UK and other European coun-
tries taxes on food and beverages are incorporated into
the price displayed on the shelf, such that the consumer’s
purchasing decision is made on the post-tax price. In
North America, taxes usually appear on the sales receipt
as a non-itemized addition to the bill. This is likely to
result in a lower level of transparency of the gross price of
an individual product, and less sensitivity to tax-related
price changes. For example, an evaluation of SSB sales
taxes in two US States observed that a significant reduc-
tion in SSB consumption did not occur, and the authors
argue that this may be because the tax was not displayed
on the shelf [9]. However, the majority of studies included
in this review did not specify whether purchasers are
aware of the tax at time of purchase decision.

 Thematic results of systematic review
This section is divided into sections addressing the five
questions outlined in the methods.
How (if at all) do particular health taxes change
consumption behaviours and what do we know about the
health-related impacts of such taxes?
Like make taxes on tobacco and alcohol products [3, 10–12],
the majority of taxes on healthy food and non-alcoholic
beverages were intended to improve population health
by reducing product consumption (see [13]). Defini-
tions of ‘unhealthy’ or ‘junk’ foods vary within included
studies but were commonly defined to target foods high
in fat, salt and/or sugar [14]. In some cases, definitions
included products high in caffeine or products that had
been subjected to intensive processing, such as proc-
essed meat [15]. For non-alcoholic beverages, the most
common targets of taxes were SSBs, which can include
soft drinks or soda, cordials, other sugar-added juices,
and ‘isotonics’ [16–18]. A small number of studies also
included milk-based products (e.g. milk desserts [19])
or full fat or high-sugar milk [20, 21].
Taking a reduction in product consumption as the
primary aim of these taxes, Table 1 summarizes the
number of studies, by study design type, which found
either positive health impacts or no/negative health
impacts. Two modeling studies [16, 18] have been in-
cluded in counts of ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ impacts
because they found both positive and negligible/nega-
tive health impacts. One mixed methods study using
modeling and evaluation methods was also double-
counted in Table 1 as it found both positive and negative
health impacts [17].
Table 1 suggests that modelling studies (e.g. [18–20])
were more likely to find a positive health impact than
evaluations [24–26], perhaps because these studies often
model the impact of higher tax rates than those that
have been evaluated.
Nonetheless, four evaluation studies identified positive
health impacts of the (generally lower level) taxes they
assessed. Evaluating the effect of the Danish fat tax
(2011-2013) on risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD),
Bodker and colleagues found marginal changes in popu-
lation risk of IHD [24]. Smed et al., also evaluating the
Danish tax, used retail scanner data to estimate the
impact of the tax on population risk of IHD, stroke and
heart failures [26]. Although the results for each disease
varied, the study estimated there was a small overall
reduction in mortality from non-communicable diseases
(mostly in men and young women). Overall, the re-
searchers estimated the tax averted or delayed 123
deaths per year, although given the absence of a control
group, a causal link to the tax cannot be drawn [26]. In
another context, Fletcher and colleagues evaluated the

 impact of changes in soft drink taxes at state level (which
were, on average, around 3%) in the United States on
BMI, obesity, and overweight [25]. Using nationally-
representative data, the authors found that soft drink taxes
had a statistically significant, albeit small effect (decrease)
on BMI, obesity, and overweight. These three studies cau-
tion that low taxes on unhealthy products may influence
consumption behaviour, however are unlikely to lead to
substantial
population
health
changes.
In
another
American-focused study (although using a different na-
tional dataset from Fletcher et al.), Kim and Kawachi
found that between 1991 and 1998, states without taxes
on SSBs or snack foods, or states that had repealed a simi-
lar tax, were greater than four and 13 times as likely,
respectively, than states with a tax to experience a rela-
tively high increase in population obesity [28].
The four included evaluation studies that found no, or
negative, health impacts were conducted in the United
States context and examined the effect of SSB taxes and
weight-related measures (e.g. BMI or obesity) in young
people. In contrast to their study above, which examined
adult populations, Fletcher and colleagues found that
current state SSB taxes in the United States had no sig-
nificant effect on children’s weight, finding that in fact
children consumed more calories from SSBs in states
that had implemented an SSB tax than in states that had
not (although this was not statistically significant) [29].
The researchers posit that in this case, the consumers
are likely not reacting to the small and possibly hidden
taxes on SSBs. In a separate article [30], Fletcher et al.
again found existing SSB taxes did not significantly
reduce weight in young people, which was attributed to
youth substituting other high-calorie drinks such as
whole milk. Using cross-sectional data on American ad-
olescents, Powell and colleagues found no statistically
significant associations between BMI and state-level SSB
taxes in grocery stores and vending machines [31].
Sturm et al. also examined existing SSB taxes in the
United States and their impact on young people’s obes-
ity. Using longitudinal data from an early childhood
study, the authors found no significant relationship
between current taxes (usually no higher than 4% in gro-
cery stores) and children’s SSB consumption or obesity
[32]. In contrast to modelling studies which often model
taxes at higher rates (and more often find positive health
impacts), the above evaluation studies provide valuable
insight into the effectiveness of existing taxes imple-
mented at lower rates.
Table 2 summarizes the number of studies, by tax rate,
distinguishing between rates of less than 20% and those of
20% or more (since this is the most commonly used
threshold across the literature reviewed (e.g. [21, 29, 30]))
and product type, distinguishing between SSBs and food
products. In total, 22 studies are included in Table 2.
Again, certain studies are included more than once if they
considered separately taxes of different rates or the health
effects of tax rates on different products [17, 20, 35]. Stud-
ies which did not make the tax rate explicit or which
focused on taxes applied to both SSBs and food are
excluded from the table. Studies involving taxes applied to
sugar/sweeteners are classified as food product taxes.
Taken collectively, the studies in Tables 1 and 2 suggest
there is considerable evidence that taxes on SSBs and un-
healthy food products can have positive health impacts.
However, as Table 1 demonstrates, the majority of studies
included in this review were based on modelling or exper-
iments involving potential taxes. This is despite the fact
that instances of such taxes exist in many countries. For
example, Finland, France, Latvia, and Hungary have
implemented taxes on both foods and beverages high in
added sugar [36]; Portugal and Hungary have imple-
mented taxes on products high in salt [36], Hungary has
implemented a tax on foods high in fat, and Denmark in-
troduced (and later repealed) a tax on saturated fat [36].
In addition, there have been several instances of taxes on
sugar-sweetened beverages, including in Mexico, two US
cities and various small island states [37–39]. This
suggests there are substantial opportunities for developing
the available research evidence concerning the evaluation
of the health impacts of taxes that have been implemented
on food and beverages.
Table 2 shows that evidence in support of applying
taxes to unhealthy products is strongest for taxes on
SSBs set at a rate of 20% or more of the price (e.g. see
[13]). The evidence for health impact from lower taxes
on SSBs is weaker, with the number of studies finding
positive health impacts equal to those that found no
positive impact. The evidence of taxes on food products
is more mixed and difficult to assess since many of the
studies involve complicated bundles of taxes (e.g. [33]).
Of the small number of studies that commented on
the relationship between the type of tax applied and
health impacts, there was a consistent finding that spe-
cific taxes (i.e. a fixed value based on the quantity, size
or weight of the product) are associated with stronger
health
benefits
than
ad
valorem
taxes,

 proportional to the price. Applying specific taxes means
that all products covered by the tax are taxed equally. In
contrast, ad valorem taxes mean that more expensive, pre-
mium products attract a higher tax, which tends to increase
price differences across brands, providing more scope for
consumers to respond to new or higher taxes by selecting a
cheaper brand or version (e.g. [37]). This is a finding which
parallels evidence regarding tobacco taxes [2].
Looking in more detail at the studies that involved
evaluating taxes that had been implemented (rather than
those modelling the effects of potential taxes), most of
which focused on the US, the evidence for the impact of
taxes on consumption patterns and health outcomes is
mixed. As of 2014, most US states had applied some level
of taxation to soft drinks, largely for revenue raising
purposes [40], and these do not appear to have had a sig-
nificant impact on consumption of soft drinks. For ex-
ample, in an analysis of sales data from Maine and Ohio,
one study found that the rate of taxation on the price of
soft drinks was, at 5.5% and 5% respectively, insufficient to
create a statistically significant change in consumption [9].
This finding was consistent with an evaluation by Sturm
and colleagues [32], which found that existing taxes on
soda, at rates that are typically around 4% in grocery
stores in most states, did not have a statistically signifi-
cantly effect on soda consumption and obesity rates in the
US [32]. Other countries have implemented a higher rate
of tax on soft drinks than in the US. For example, in
September 2013, Mexico implemented a 10% tax on soft
drinks and an 8% tax on unhealthy snacks [41]. It is esti-
mated that the tax on soft drinks contributed to a 6%
average decrease in purchasing of taxed beverages by
December
2014,
with
purchasing
reductions
being
greatest in low income households [42].
Twenty-three studies considered the estimated or actual
health impacts of taxes applied in conjunction, or com-
parison, with a range of other health-related interventions.
Several studies examined the impact of using subsidies –
i.e. negative taxes on ‘healthy’ products - alongside taxes
on ‘unhealthy’ products. Most often, the subsidies were
applied to fruit and vegetables [18, 21, 43]. Other ‘healthy’
products that were included in the analyses observed were
grain-based products high in fibre, fresh fish, and bottled
water [14, 44, 45].
Several of these studies indicate that a combination of
taxes and subsidies can have large behavioural and health
impacts [44, 46]. However, it is difficult to ascertain from
the findings reported in these modelling studies and experi-
ments whether taxes, subsidies or a combination of the
two, are most effective in achieving such impacts. Many of
the studies point out, however, that a key advantage of
employing subsidies in combination with taxes is that the
former can help to offset the inequitable (or regressive)
burden of the latter.
A number of the studies considered (likely or actual)
differential health impacts by population group. Of
these, eight found that taxes on food/beverages were
likely to have a greater impact on younger population
groups [22, 23, 26, 27, 47–50] and 15 found that public
health impacts are likely to be largest for lower income
groups [22, 25, 27, 32, 33, 42, 44, 46, 48, 49, 51–56]. In
contrast, two studies [23, 34] found no significant differ-
ences between income groups. This suggests that taxes
on unhealthy food and beverages may contribute to
addressing health inequalities, but that more research is
required. As we discuss in more detail later on, 27 of the
included studies highlighted the regressive burden of
taxes on food and beverage products, suggesting that
there is a balance to be struck between the inequitable
burden of ill-health and the inequitable burden of taxes.
Overall, there is considerable evidence that high tax
rates (i.e. those that raise the unit price by 20% or more)
on beverages are likely to have a positive impact on
health behaviours and outcomes. The evidence is similar
for taxes targeting unhealthy foods, though there are a
smaller number of studies and the taxes in question
were often more complicated. This finding is consistent
with a recent review, which found that food taxes and
subsidies are associated with changes in consumption
behaviours [57] and also reflects what is known about
alcohol and tobacco taxes [3, 10–12]. However, as noted,
it is apparent that such tax rates are far higher than
those that have actually been implemented. Hence, it
may be that, as Fletcher and colleagues noted, “typically
imposed beverage taxes aren’t large enough or transpar-
ent enough to lead to meaningful behaviour change.”
([23], p.1064).
Can health taxes on manufacturers and retailers change
behaviours?
Most studies focus on health taxes that are applied at
the point of sale, and are intended to try to motivate
consumers to change their consumption decisions. It
should be noted, however, that a tax on manufacturers
may or may not be intended to change behaviour in re-
lation to a finished good, but rather to the use of specific
raw materials (ingredients).
We identified three studies targeted at manufacturers
or retailers. One such study, by Miao, Beghin, & Jensen
[19], modelled an approach to taxation that targeted the
process of adding sweeteners to products, and compared
this with a consumption tax on sweetened products [19].
The rationale was that a tax on sweetener would
incentivize producers of high-sugar products to reduce
sweeteners in food processing by increasing the unit cost
of
these
products
to
the
manufacturer
(while
the
consumption tax would change consumer-purchasing
patterns). As the tax increases the cost of production,

 suppliers (manufacturers) may respond by increasing the
price of the finished good and/or decreasing supply of
the product in response to the reduction in profits they
make by selling it. However, in some cases, it may not
be economically advantageous for suppliers to pass on
higher costs to consumers, or to reduce supply in
response to higher costs. In this instance, it may be
regarded as beneficial to change the formulation of
product, e.g. by reducing the fat or sugar content. In this
case, the authors conclude that both approaches are
potentially effective, but that taxing added sweeteners is
likely to have a smaller impact on consumers’ real
expenditures than taxing final products.
Another study, which assessed the impacts of a set of
complex unhealthy food taxes implemented in Hungary,
undertaken by Hungary’s National Institute for Health
Development (cited in [56]), found that substantial
changes were subsequently made to the manufacturing
of certain products. A survey of manufacturers sug-
gested that the taxing of products exceeding a minimum
threshold of certain ingredients such as sugar and fat led
40% of manufacturers to modify their recipe; 30%
removed the ingredient entirely, and 70% reduced the
level of the ingredient [58].
In theory, Scotland’s public health supplement on large
retailers selling tobacco and alcohol had the potential to
discourage retailers from selling either alcohol or to-
bacco (the latter was a more likely outcome, given the
relative profitability of the two types of products). In
practice, however, this evaluation found that the level of
the tax was too low to stimulate changes in retail prac-
tice, which enhanced the predictability of the associated
revenue (as discussed above) [4].
Do taxes that target health-damaging products succeed in
providing additional fiscal revenues?
Most studies find that, while taxes on products reduces
demand for those products, they add to fiscal revenues
(e.g. [57]). However, our review suggests that the associ-
ated revenue streams may be subject to a significant
degree of
volatility. As human responses to price
changes are complex, and vary by context and over time,
the extent of the revenues likely to be raised by health
taxes is difficult to estimate with precision. Such esti-
mates are particularly vulnerable to uncertainty over
longer periods. For example, Zhen and colleagues [56]
examine the interaction of taxes on SSBs with human
habit
formation,
in
which
decreases
in
consumer
purchasing attributable to SSB taxes are larger in the
long-term as habits are gradually broken, resulting in
progressively lower tax revenues. However, the au-
thors acknowledge that revenues could also increase
over time as consumers became more accustomed to
higher prices (e.g. [52]).
It seems clearer that the revenues generated by con-
sumer taxes are easier to predict, and are likely to be
higher, when specific, rather than ad valorem, taxes are
employed. For a more detailed explanation of this point,
see [2] in relation to tobacco taxation.
We identified one study that assessed the impacts of a
tax applied to retailers of alcohol and tobacco which, be-
ing set on the basis of the value of premises, was difficult
for retailers to avoid or pass on to consumers. Hence,
unusually for a tax framed as health-related, the entities
from whom the taxes were collected bore the full burden
of the tax. The ‘public health supplement’ was a levy on
large retailers of alcohol and tobacco products imple-
mented in Scotland 2012-2015. The study found that the
revenue from this type of tax (administered through a
supplement to the business rates system) was highly pre-
dictable over a three-year period [4]. Indeed, although
the tax was relatively short-lived (it was discontinued
after 3 years in the face of resistance from large retailers)
the revenue raised in this period was slightly above the
government’s predictions. The case study shows that
taxes can be designed in such a way as to enhance the
predictability of the associated revenues. However, by
making the tax uneconomic for retailers to try to avoid
(i.e. by changing their policies with respect to selling
alcohol or tobacco), while largely insulating consumers
from the burden of the tax, there was no mechanism for
stimulating desirable changes in the supply and con-
sumption of such products, or reducing associated
health harms [4].
What is the degree of support among public and policy
communities for non-traditional health taxes and are there
means of increasing support?
Several papers provided insights into three broad cat-
egories of factors affecting the feasibility and implemen-
tation of new health taxes. The first concerns public
opinion regarding proposed, or actual, taxes. Here,
studies consistently find that public support for new
consumption taxes, or tax increases, is low [60–63],
though some suggest that there is public or ministerial
support for sugared beverage taxes in some contexts [39,
64, 65]. A four-country study in the Western Pacific re-
gion by Thow et al. suggests that, although governments
are ultimately concerned with raising revenue, framing a
tax around health promotion can assist in getting such a
tax onto the policy agenda in the first place [39]. For ex-
ample, a tax on unhealthy food products introduced in
French Polynesia in 2002 was framed as a response to
concerns regarding poor nutrition and non-communicable
disease [39]. The tax enjoyed broad ministerial support,
which was attributed to the tax’s earmarking for public
health and other cultural, educational, and youth-focused
initiatives, which benefited seven of the 17 ministers in the
Wright et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:583 
Page 9 of 14
 government [39]. More generally, support among the gen-
eral public seems to be higher when credible commitments
are made to earmarking funds for specific health activities
and objectives, such as subsidizing healthier foods or
targeting child obesity (e.g. [63, 64]).
We identified a smaller number of studies that consid-
ered the media coverage of proposed or actual health
taxes which might be expected to both reflect and shape
public opinion. In some cases, such as the Danish fat tax
and the Scottish public health supplement (described
above), industry interests opposed to the tax have been
able to dominate media coverage, helping to secure fur-
ther opposition to the tax (which, in both these cases,
was eventually dropped) [4, 24, 66]. In contrast, [67]
analysis of an SSB tax in Mexico provides an example of
a supportive media, in which public health advocates
successfully utilized media campaigns to raise the public
and political profile of the issue and communicate with
the public. Less positively, [68] analysis of debates about
potential soda taxes in three US states found that, des-
pite public health advocates’ ability to dominate media
coverage with pro-tax messages, none of the proposals
were implemented. Hence, while media support for a
health tax proposal may be important for it to succeed,
it is not sufficient [38].
Twelve studies considered policy design and imple-
mentation factors shaping the fate of proposed and ac-
tual health taxes. Studies considering political factors
suggested that political support for, and opposition to,
health taxes are likely to be key to understanding why
some taxes are implemented and others are not (or why
some taxes are repealed) (e.g. [3, 20, 31, 64, 65, 67, 68]).
These studies also suggest that opposition to health
taxes can develop relatively quickly. For example, [69]
highlights how political opposition to a proposed soft
drink tax arose in 2009 in New York State and contributed
to the tax proposal being withdrawn prior to implementa-
tion, while in contrast [67] outlines the substantive advo-
cacy efforts in Mexico to combat multi-stakeholder
opposition, leading to Mexico’s tax being successfully
implemented.
In a study of taxes implemented in Pacific Island
nations, [39] identify industry lobbying in Fiji as a cause
of the decision to abolish the country’s domestic excise
tax on SSBs. Two studies of the short-lived Danish fat
tax both argued that lobbying by food industry interests
helped secure political opposition to the tax once it had
been implemented, while there appears to have been
only limited efforts by the government to secure broader
public support. In the absence of such support, political
opposition increased and a decision was taken to drop
the tax after less than a year (in advance of any analysis
of its health impacts) [24, 66]. The assessment of
Scotland’s
levy
on
large
retailers
reached
similar
conclusions in relation to industry opposition and the
political sustainability of a policy framed as a health tax
for which the health rationale appeared to shift over
time [4].
What are the key critiques of health taxes and their
implementation and what options exist to manage these
challenges?
We identified three key criticisms of taxes on unhealthy
products. Twenty-seven of the included studies highlighted
the regressive nature of the health tax examined (e.g.
[58, 70, 71]). Poorer groups may be more price sensitive
than other groups, and therefore more likely to change
their behaviour in response to a tax. In this sense, taxes
may play a role in addressing health inequity. In addition,
it is important to acknowledge that the regressivity of exist-
ing taxes does not necessarily imply that tax increases will
be regressive since, if poorer consumers are more respon-
sive the burden of the tax may shift more to wealthier
consumers [74]. This argument is often made in relation to
tobacco taxation – see [2]. However, if price elasticity is
low (as is typical for many unhealthy products), those with
lower incomes who continue to buy these products have
less to spend on basic needs, such as housing, heating, and
healthy food, potentially at the expense of their health and
general welfare. Available research does not sufficiently
address the question of whether, among low-income con-
sumers, the overall benefits of tax-induced price increases
(i.e. reducing consumption of unhealthy products) out-
weigh the risk of harm from financial hardship for those
who do not reduce consumption. More generally, existing
evidence concerning outcomes in terms of progressivity/
regressivity is limited by the fact that nearly all studies
addressing this issue that we identified were based on
modelling or predictive experiments. If this particular com-
bination of fiscal measures has occurred in practice, we
were unable to find any evaluation studies that covered the
issue of regressivity.
For policy actors concerned about the regressive
potential of taxes on unhealthy products, one potential
response to this would be, as noted above, to use the
revenue from such taxes to subsidize other ‘healthy’
foods, such as fruit and vegetables. In this way, it may be
possible to put together a package of policies in which
there can be some confidence that the overall impact on
poverty will be negligible [72].
A second criticism, put forward by Fletcher et al., is
that food and beverage taxes may simply lead to con-
sumers substituting the taxed products for similar, non-
taxed alternatives which are not necessarily healthier,
such as sports drinks or juice [29]. This is an issue that
has also been identified in the context of differential
taxes on different types of tobacco products [2]. It im-
plies that there is a need to carefully assess behavioural
Wright et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:583 
Page 10 of 14
 changes in response to taxes intended to achieve health
goals, and that policymakers need to stay alert to the
possibility that such taxes may need to be revised or
expanded in response to changing behaviours.
The third key criticism is that implemented taxes are
often too low to have a meaningful health impact, a
criticism that is borne out by the empirical evidence, as
noted above [29]. It may be appropriate to consider the
level of a tax before deciding whether or not it is appro-
priate to frame it as a ‘health tax’. Lower and incremen-
tal taxes are more likely to provide a stable source of
revenues (which may, or may not, be spent on health-
related activities) but they are less likely to achieve
behaviour changes [59, 71].
In addition to these three criticisms, it is evident that,
while framing new taxes or tax increases as mechanisms
for increasing health spending may increase public
support, funds may not always be clearly earmarked in
practice [2, 4]. Where this occurs, this may undermine
support for such taxes in the longer-term.
Looking back across our five research questions, it is ap-
parent that the results of our review are consistent with
those focusing on traditional excise taxes on alcohol and
tobacco. Those reviews show that increasing taxes leads to
reduced consumption among the population and can be a
valuable source of revenue for government [10, 73–75]. A
review by Chaloupka and colleagues shows that revenue
from tobacco taxes may be more reliable than those
discussed in the present review, however, because there
are fewer substitutes available for tobacco products, and
the demand for them is therefore relatively inelastic [74].
With regard to public support for alcohol and tobacco
taxes, studies find greater public support for these ap-
proaches when the tax is earmarked for healthcare or for
combating tobacco- or alcohol-related harms [74, 76].
The concern with the regressivity of health taxes is also
relevant for alcohol and tobacco. A recent study con-
firmed that alcohol taxes are regressive, although the
authors interpreted this effect to be small [77]. A review
by Hill and colleagues found that tobacco price increases
via taxes has a greater impact on low-income groups
compared with those with high incomes (although,
similar to the present review, this effect is argued to be
positive given its potential to reduce socioeconomic
inequalities) [78].
Discussion
Although extensive efforts have already been made to
understand the impacts of, and responses to, tobacco
and alcohol excise taxes [2, 3, 10, 12], this review is the
first attempt to systematically identify and synthesize
this broader literature on health taxes. In this section,
we focus on summarizing the key implications of the
review for future research and policymaking.
The review highlights that there has been a rapid
increase in research in this area, most of which focuses
on taxes on food products or nutrients (indeed, in the
time between updating our searches and submitting this
paper, several further studies have been published on
this topic, (e.g. [72, 74])). Of the studies included in this
review, the majority (n = 93) focus on health taxes in
high income settings (particularly the USA, n = 50).
However, the findings are likely to be highly relevant for
policymakers in developing country contexts, in which
efforts to provide universal health coverage require the
effective utilization and expansion of domestic public
sector financial resources [5].
Nearly half of developing countries have tax shares of
less than 15% of GDP [79], and many are already operat-
ing near their tax capacity – suggesting that improve-
ments in tax collection alone will not provide adequate
resources for health. Indirect taxes levied on health-
damaging goods offer a potentially attractive source of
additional fiscal space as, in addition to raising revenue,
they are a proven method of influencing individual be-
haviour, reducing negative externalities on others, and
curbing the incidence of the costly NCDs caused by con-
sumption of such goods. Taxes on SSBs recently passed
in California and the UK provide potential for additional
evaluative case studies. Methodologically, the review
identified a strong preference for predictive research
(especially modelling) over evaluation. The review found
that modelling studies tend to predict more positive
health impacts than evaluations (likely explained by the
fact the taxes researchers have modelled have generally
been higher than those that those actually implemented),
suggesting that more evaluative research is needed as
policymaking in this area evolves.
Turning to policy, our findings suggest that a number
of taxation tools are available to policymakers - and that
each has advantages and disadvantages. The choice of
taxation tool to apply will depend on the overall aim of
the tax and the context in which policymakers seek to
implement it. Overall, we identify four substantive re-
sults. First, while there appears to be a large number of
innovative health taxes being implemented, most involve
expanding the number of unhealthy commodity prod-
ucts (notably sugar) that are taxed. This is a possible
source of concern since public support for new com-
modity taxes tends to be low, and high public or political
support is likely to be required for taxes to be initiated
and sustained. Furthermore, as examples such as the
short-lived Danish fat tax, the Fijian SSB tax [24, 39] and
the (unsuccessful) attempts of several US States to intro-
duce SSBs taxes [69] illustrate, such policies are likely to
be challenged by strong industry interests. In the case of
Scotland’s Public Health Supplement, there was no
strong public opposition to the tax (which was not easily
Wright et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:583 
Page 11 of 14
 passed on to consumers of targeted products), but the
government faced extremely strong opposition from
affected businesses and, in that context, opted to discon-
tinue the tax after 3 years [4].
Second, our findings suggest that commitments to
earmarking the revenue from health taxes for specific
purposes, such as funding health system improvement
or obesity prevention, can increase public and political
support for taxes [39, 60, 80, 81]. Earmarking revenue
for health spending is one means of encouraging support
from the public health community (e.g. NGOs, re-
searchers and practitioners) which may help offset the
influence of industry interests. However, as both the ex-
perience of the Public Health Supplement [4] and earlier
tobacco tax policies have shown [12], governments may
fail to abide by initial earmarking commitments once
taxes have been implemented, and this provides an obvi-
ous lobbying focus for those opposed to the tax, under-
mining public and political support for its existence [12].
Third, there are potential mechanisms for reducing
the regressive nature of health taxes on consumer prod-
ucts. Options identified in this review were: (i) using the
revenue raised from taxes to subsidize healthier prod-
ucts; and (ii) targeting ingredients used in the produc-
tion of certain products, instead of the product itself (as
seen in the UK sugar tax). In the latter case, producers
are incentivized to remove or decrease the targeted in-
gredient from the product. Assuming that any related
manufacturing costs are not passed on to the consumer, it
is plausible that the health impact goals may be attained
without negatively affecting those on lower incomes.
Fourth, our results show the importance of clear
prioritization of objectives when designing taxes. Some
objectives may be in conflict. For example, our results
(and the previous reviews of tobacco and alcohol prod-
uct taxes) show that, if the purpose of a tax is to achieve
health gains via behavioural change, it must be set at a
sufficiently high level. For SSBs, taxes of 20% or more of
the sale price are most likely to be effective in this re-
spect, whereas the evidence is much less clear regarding
lower level taxes (such as many of those levied on SSBs
to date). In contrast, if the aim of a new tax is to raise
revenue (whether these are earmarked for health pur-
poses or not), then taxes set at a rate that is high enough
to incentivize behavioural changes may be less desirable,
since this will reduce the stability of associated revenues,
and a lower rate may be more appropriate.
A number of limitations to this study exist. The size of
the review necessitates that not all titles and abstracts
could be screened by all authors. In addition, both the
variable methodological approaches of included studies
and our commitment to providing an inclusive overview
of existing evidence meant it was impossible to apply a
uniform method of critical appraisal across studies.
Thus, it is possible that the ‘weight’ attached to low
quality studies is similar to that of high-quality studies.
We are also limited by the evidence available, and the
relative lack of evaluation studies in particular.
We have, however, brought together studies from mul-
tiple
disciplines,
including
public
health,
nutrition,
health policy, economics, medicine, and psychology,
allowing us to provide a comprehensive overview of the
policy lessons regarding health taxes. This is, to our
knowledge, the first attempt to provide a broad overview
of the evidence relating to these taxes. It therefore
addresses a series of questions that policy actors consid-
ering health taxes (or tax increases) ought to consider in
designing any new measure and identifies important
gaps for future research to address.
Conclusions
If the primary policy goal of a health tax is to reduce
consumption
of
unhealthy
products,
then
current
evidence supports the implementation of taxes that in-
crease the price of products by 20% or more. However,
where taxes are effective in changing health behaviours,
the predictability of the revenue stream is reduced.
Hence, policy actors need to be clear about the primary
goal of any health tax and frame the tax accordingly –
not doing so leaves taxes vulnerable to hostile lobbying.
Conversely, earmarking health taxes for health spending
tends to increase public support so long as policymakers
follow through on specified spending commitments.
With more and more countries implementing new kinds
of health taxes, there are numerous opportunities for
real-world evaluations to substantially strengthen the
current evidence-base.
