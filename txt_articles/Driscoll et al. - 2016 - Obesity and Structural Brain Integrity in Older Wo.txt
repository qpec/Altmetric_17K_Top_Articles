Abstract
Background: Midlife obesity has been linked to age-related brain atrophy and risk of dementia, but the relationships are less clear for older 
individuals. These associations may be explained by changes in appetite or metabolism in the dementia prodrome; thus, prospective studies 
with adequate follow-up are needed. We examined the associations that obesity (body mass index, BMI) and change in BMI over an average of 
6.6 (1.0–9.1) years have with global and regional brain and white matter lesion volumes in a sample of 1,366 women aged 65–80.
Methods: Least square means for regional brain volumes and white matter lesion loads for women grouped by BMI and changes in BMI were 
generated from multivariable linear models with and without adjustment for demographic and health covariates.
Results: Both global obesity and increase in BMI were associated with lower cerebrospinal fluid and higher specific brain volumes (ps < .05), 
after controlling for diabetes and other cerebrovascular disease risk factors. Obesity, but not change in BMI, predicted lower lesion loads for 
the total, parietal, and occipital white matter (ps < .05).
Conclusions: Obesity in this cohort is associated with less brain atrophy and lower ischemic lesion loads. The findings are consistent with our 
previous report of worse cognitive performance in association with weight loss (probably not due to frailty) in this cohort and in line with the 
idea of the “obesity paradox” as differences in dementia risk vary across time, whereby midlife obesity seems to be a predictor of dementia, 
whereas weight loss seems to be a better predictor at older ages.
Keywords: Brain volume—Lesion volume—White matter hyperintensities—Aging—BMI
Obesity is related to a variety of unfavorable health outcomes, 
including cardiovascular, pulmonary, and endocrine diseases (1). 
Accumulating evidence suggests that midlife obesity is associated 
with higher risk for dementia later in life (2–5), while studies explor-
ing this association in the elderly remain conflicting (6–9). Obesity 
prevalence in the United States is currently higher than 30% and 
growing rapidly (10), especially in adults aged 50 or older (1). 
Given that the prevalence of both obesity (1) and dementia (10) are 
approaching epidemic proportions, the prevention of obesity may 
contribute to reduction of dementia burden and thereby have signifi-
cant public health implications.
Both age and obesity have been linked to unfavorable structural 
brain changes. A certain amount of global and regionally specific 
brain atrophy is common even in normally aging adults (11,12). 
Obesity in its own right has been associated with such structural 
brain changes, including loss of global and regional brain volume

 and white matter (WM) integrity (13–16). In parallel, white mat-
ter hyperintensities (WMH), visible on brain imaging scans of older 
individuals (17), are more common and extensive in patients with 
cardiovascular risk factors (18). Obesity is an independent risk factor 
associated with numerous indices of cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
(19). Evidence suggests a relatively greater burden of WMH in obese 
older adults (17); however, studies of WMH in obesity are limited.
Examinations of the effects of obesity on brain morphology are 
also limited in number. In addition, cross-sectional studies in older 
adults may be misleading because loss of appetite and hyperpha-
gia are common in the dementia prodrome. Therefore, studies in 
which adiposity parameters are obtained early in the follow-up and 
over time are necessary to clarify the relationships between obesity 
and structural brain aging. The Women’s Health Initiative Memory 
Study (WHIMS)-MRI (12,20) offers an unprecedented opportunity 
to examine these relationships in a large and well-defined cohort. We 
ask whether either global obesity (body mass index, BMI) or change 
in BMI is associated with specific global and regional brain or lesion 
volumes, with and without adjustment for demographic and health 
factors.
Materials and Methods
Participants
We analyzed data from 1,366 women, 65–80 years of age, who were 
enrolled between January 2005 and April 2006 in WHIMS-MRI, 
which was designed to contrast MRI outcomes among women who 
had been assigned to active versus placebo hormone therapy (HT) 
during the WHIMS trials in 14 of its sites (20). Women were free 
of dementia at enrollment based on the ascertainment of probable 
dementia and cognitive impairment. A detailed description of the 
four-phase protocol for detecting probable dementia and cognitive 
impairment has been previously published (20,21). MRI scans were 
obtained, on average, 8.02 (Conjugate Equine Estrogens (CEE) + 
Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) arm of the trial) or 7.97 
(CEE-alone arm of the trial) years following randomization and 3.0 
(CEE + MPA) or 1.4 (CEE-alone) years following termination of 
HT. WHIMS-MRI also obtained measurements of subclinical CVD 
(22). Studies were approved by the National Institutes of Health and 
Institutional Review Boards of participating institutions. All partici-
pants provided written informed consent.
MRI Protocol
The MRI acquisition and image processing protocols were devel-
oped, standardized and validated by the investigators at the MRI 
Quality Control Center, Department of Radiology at the University 
of Pennsylvania and implemented centrally (22–25). Scanning 
sequences were performed with a FOV = 22 
cm and matrix size of 
256 
× 
256 as follows: (i) 3D-plane gradient echo localizer; (ii) sagittal 
T1-weighted spin echo mid-slice image to obtain the anatomic loca-
tion of the AC/PC for slice angle and slice positioning; (iii) oblique 
axial spin density/T2-weighted spin echo images (TR = 3,200 
ms, 
TE = 30/120 
ms, slice thickness = 3 
mm); (iv) oblique axial fluid 
attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2-weighted spin echo 
images (TR = 8,000 
ms, TI = 2,000 
ms, TE = 100 
ms, slice thick-
ness = 3 
mm); and (v) axial 3D spoiled gradient recalled T1-weighted 
gradient echo images parallel to the AC/PC plane (TR = 21 
ms, 
TE = 8 
ms, flip angle = 30, slice thickness = 1.5 
mm).
T1-weighted images underwent preprocessing to a standard-
ized protocol for alignment, removal of extracranial material, and 
segmentation of tissue into white and gray parenchyma and cerebro-
spinal fluid (CSF). An automated computer-based template warping 
method, which sums the number of voxels within each anatomical 
region of interest, provided regional volumes. Intracranial volume 
was defined as total cerebral volume plus ventricular CSF. The 
ischemic lesion segmentation algorithm was applied following addi-
tional preprocessing, including standardization and coregistration, 
based on local signal features extracted from coregistered multipara-
metric MRI sequences. A trained support vector machine classifier 
was used to classify ischemic lesion volume generally correspond-
ing to small vessel ischemic disease (SVID = ischemic WM disease 
and lacunar infarction) (12,22). SVID was operationally defined as 
nonmass lesions with FLAIR signal greater than that of normal gray 
matter (GM) in a vascular distribution. The automated method was 
validated against manual segmentation by an expert (22) and has 
been applied to other cohorts (23,24). Supratentorial tissue was then 
classified as normal or ischemic WM and assigned to one of 92 ana-
tomical regions of interest (22).
Anthropometric Measurements
Weight to the nearest 0.1 
kg and height to the nearest 0.1 
cm were 
recorded annually with calibrated scales by trained technicians. BMI 
is defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in 
meters. The baseline measurements were obtained at entry into the 
parent WHI study. Change in BMI was calculated at the last visit 
prior to MRI compared with baseline over an average of 6.6 (range 
1.0–9.1) years.
Statistical Analysis
General linear models were used to examine bivariate relationships 
between BMI at the last visit prior to the MRI and age at MRI, educa-
tion, race/ethnicity, hypertension, prior CVD, diabetes, if on a low cal-
orie diet, and HT assignment. Due to their highly skewed distribution, 
lesion volumes were log transformed. Least square means for select 
regional brain and lesion load volumes for categories of BMI were 
generated from multivariable linear models controlling for intracra-
nial volume, HT, race/ethnicity, education, alcohol use, prior use of 
HT, self-reported dieting at WHI baseline, hypertension, CVD history, 
diabetes, age at MRI, caloric intake at WHI baseline, and time from 
WHI enrollment to MRI. These same models were used for calcula-
tion of least square means for various regional brain or lesion load 
volumes and BMI percent change from baseline to visit prior to MRI.
Categories based on BMI included those with BMI less than 25 
(<25), 25–29, 30–35, and higher than 35 (35+). Categories based on 
change in BMI from baseline included a group for which decrease 
in BMI was larger than 5% (decrease >5%), a group that remained 
largely stable (change between −5% and +5%), and a group for 
which BMI increased more than 5%. The regional volumes exam-
ined included whole brain, CSF, and volumes of total WM, total 
GM, frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital WM or GM, respec-
tively, basal ganglia, orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, precuneus, 
and the hippocampus.
Results are reported as significant for regional brain volume 
associations if p ≤ .003, and p ≤ .01 for regional WM lesion vol-
umes, after employing stringent Bonferroni corrections for multiple 
comparisons. Given that large effects of obesity on brain volume are 
not expected in healthy adult women, all results are reported in the 
tables in order to help guide future research, as many comparisons 
were significant at p < .05 but did not survive the more stringent cor-
rections for multiple comparisons.

 Results
The sample was predominantly Caucasian (91%) and women 
were between 70 and 89 years of age at the time of the MRI scan. 
Most women had either some college education or a college degree 
(72%); fewer than 5% had not completed high school. Most women 
(~87%) had no prior history of CVD or diabetes and were not on a 
low calorie diet. Sample characteristics are presented in Table 1. For 
analyses purposes, the sample was further separated into four groups 
based on baseline BMI and into three groups based on change in 
BMI from baseline. More participants in the obese and overweight 
groups were hypertensive and diabetic at follow-up (p < .05), and no 
such differences were observed between groupings based on change 
in BMI from baseline. There were no significant differences in global 
cognitive status or in depressive symptoms among any of the groups 
(p > .05).
Significant relationships between global obesity measured at 
the last visit prior to MRI and regional brain volumes after cor-
recting for multiple comparisons were observed for the following 
(Table 2): whole brain (p = .0004), CSF (p = .004), total, frontal, 
and temporal WM (ps < .003), and the hippocampus (p < .0001), 
such that higher BMI was associated with higher volumes in these 
regions, with the exception that lower CSF volume was seen in 
the obese.
Significant relationships between change in BMI (from baseline to 
last visit prior to MRI) and brain volumes after corrections for mul-
tiple comparisons were observed only for women who experienced a 
BMI decrease of 5% or more from baseline for the following regions

 (Table 3): temporal GM (p < .05), cingulate cortex (p = .002), and the 
hippocampus (p = .0002). There were no statistically significant asso-
ciations between BMI and brain volume for those who maintained 
or gained weight (ps > .05). Moreover, those with relatively stable 
weight over follow-up (change between −5% and +5%) had the high-
est basal ganglia and total and regional GM volumes.
Lower regional lesion loads were observed in relation to global 
obesity only in parietal WM (p = .01; Table 4). Relationships between 
change in BMI from baseline (>5%) and regional lesion loads were 
largely absent (Table 5).
Discussion
The goal of the study was to determine whether there is a relation-
ship between either global obesity or change in BMI during follow-
up and either volumes of specific brain regions or regional lesion

 loads. Specific regional brain volume associations with global obesity 
were observed for the whole brain volume, CSF, total, frontal, and 
temporal WM, and the hippocampus. Specific regional brain volume 
associations with increase in BMI from baseline were observed for 
the temporal GM, cingulate cortex, and the hippocampus.
Prior cross-sectional studies have suggested reduced brain vol-
umes in nondemented obese individuals. These regions include the 
whole brain volume (14,15,26,27), GM (28,29), prefrontal regions 
(14,27,29), and the temporal lobe (13). Little in terms of relationships 
between obesity and the rates of regional brain atrophy, both when 
employing an obesity cutoff or when looking across the range of BMI 
values, was observed however in the nondemented participants from 
the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) who undergo con-
sensus diagnosis and are prospectively screened for impairment simi-
larly to WHIMS participants (30). In the BLSA studies, associations 
between obesity and brain volumes only emerged when individuals 
who developed cognitive impairment over the follow-up were included 
in analyses. These findings suggest that cross-sectional studies may 
overestimate associations between brain volumes and obesity due to 
inclusion of individuals who eventually develop cognitive impairment.
Obesity in our sample of women aged 65 and older seems to be 
associated with better brain integrity as indexed by higher regional 
brain volumes, lower CSF, and lower lesion load volumes. Although 
our findings may seem counterintuitive, they seem to be in line with 
a number of studies supporting the idea that differences in dementia 
risk vary across time whereby higher BMI in midlife is a predictor 
of dementia (2–5), whereas weight loss seems to be a better predic-
tor at older ages (31–34). The term “obesity paradox” was coined 
recently to capture the predictive ability of BMI changes over time 
after several studies reported excess weight, which traditionally has 
been considered detrimental for health, to predict survival in the 
elderly (9,33). Our present findings are also in line with our previous 
report of worse cognitive performance in association with all-cause 
weight loss in the WHIMS cohort (34). Lower BMI or weight loss in 
this older sample potentially signals increased risk for impairment, 
as weight loss is common in predementia stages and is one of the 
principal manifestations of AD (35). There is some literature to sug-
gest, however, that the late life obesity paradox does not exist when 
earlier trajectories can be taken into account (33).
Given the link between obesity and a variety of unfavorable health 
outcomes, including CVD, our secondary goal was to assess the rela-
tionships between either most current BMI measurement (closest to 
MRI visit) or change in BMI from baseline and regional lesion volumes. 
In our sample, global BMI predicted lesion loads for the parietal WM 
only after correcting for multiple comparisons. Little was observed in 
terms of change in BMI from baseline predicting current lesion load. 
Our results support the assertion that age-related differences in WMH 
volumes are significantly increased in the presence of comorbidities, 
including obesity, especially after 50 years of age (36). Although the lit-
erature on the associations between WM lesion load and BMI is rather 
limited, we are in agreement with the reports of associations between 
elevated BMI and increased risk of WM lesions (37).
This study comes with some inherent limitations. The sample 
is drawn from participants in a randomized clinical trial and is not 
population based. All participants are older, postmenopausal females; 
hence, we cannot generalize the findings to men or younger post- or 
premenopausal women. Some biases may have arisen due to differ-
ential survivorship. Also, we cannot infer from our data whether the 
changes in weight are a consequence of or predate changes in regional 
brain volumes or lesion loads. We are not able to distinguish between 
intentional and nonintentional weight loss or gain, which may have 
different relationships with brain health. It is also impossible to infer 
whether there was an increase in morbidity or mortality associated 
with weight change, as opposed to being a part of normal aging pro-
cess, that might signal some underlying pathology, such as frailty.
Frailty is conceptualized as a loss of physiologic integrity associ-
ated with loss of lean mass, neuroendocrine dysregulation, and immune 
dysfunction. Although a common perception of a frail person is small 
and thin, recent evidence suggests that frailty in later life may start as 
early as middle age, with midlife obesity (38) and midlife CVD (39) as 
potential underlying causes. Moreover, frail health is not only associ-
ated with increased likelihood of CVD but also associated with many

 noninvasive measures of CVD in those without a CVD history (40). 
Hence, it is not entirely surprising that frailty also relates to several obe-
sity-related health conditions and that the development of frailty and 
associated weight loss could potentially contribute to the “obesity para-
dox”—where those overweight or obese seem to have a better progno-
sis. Additionally, although unlikely to be a major cause of weight gain in 
this age group, the possibility also remains that increased BMI, at least 
in some, is a result of increased lean mass due to physical activity.
The limitations, however, should not undermine many unique 
aspects of the study, including the large number of extensively screened 
and characterized community-dwelling, older women with prospec-
tive follow-ups, and validated image processing methods. The mag-
nitude of associations between regional brain volumes and obesity in 
our community-dwelling cohort of generally healthy, older women 
were small and most do not survive conservative adjustments for mul-
tiple comparisons. Our study adds information to the literature on 
changes in obesity over a period of several years preceding the MRI 
measurements. Although cross-sectional studies comparing currently 
obese and lean people provide a useful glimpse into the neurobiol-
ogy of obesity, they also highlight the need for studies with extended 
follow-up, which would allow us to infer whether neurological abnor-
malities precede, accompany, or follow the obese state. Clarification 
of the consequences of intentional versus unintentional weight loss is 
also needed to help guide clinical recommendations for older adults.
