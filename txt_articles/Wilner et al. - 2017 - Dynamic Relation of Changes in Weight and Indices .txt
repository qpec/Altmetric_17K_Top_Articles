Background-—Obesity may increase heart failure risk through cardiac remodeling. Cross-sectional associations between adiposity
and cardiac structure and function have been elucidated, but the impact of longitudinal changes in adiposity on cardiac remodeling
is less well understood.
Methods and Results-—Participants in the Dallas Heart Study without cardiovascular disease or left ventricular dysfunction
underwent assessment of body weight, anthropometrics, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and 7 years later.
Associations between changes in indices of generalized and central adiposity with changes in left ventricular mass, volume, mass/
volume ratio (concentricity), wall thickness, and ejection fraction were assessed using multivariable linear regression. The study
cohort (n=1262) mean age was 44 years with 57% women, 44% black, and 36% obese participants. At follow-up, 41% had ≥5%
weight gain, and 15% had ≥5% weight loss. Greater weight gain was associated with younger age, lower risk factor burden, and
lower body mass index at baseline. In multivariable models adjusting for age, sex, race, comorbid conditions at baseline and follow-
up, baseline adiposity, and cardiac measurement, increasing weight was associated with increases in left ventricular mass (b=0.10,
P<0.0001), wall thickness (b=0.10, P<0.0001), and concentricity (b=0.06, P=0.002), with modest effects on end-diastolic volume
(b=0.04, P=0.044) and ejection fraction (b=0.05, P=0.046). Similar results were seen with other adiposity indices.
Conclusions-—Concentric left ventricular remodeling is the predominant phenotype linked to increasing adiposity in middle age.
Our findings support the importance of weight management to prevent secular changes in adiposity, concentric remodeling, and
eventual heart failure over time. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2017;6:e005897. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.117.005897.)

T
he relationship of obesity with cardiovascular diseases
(CVDs) is well established,1-3 but the cardiac structural
changes underlying the disease processes are less well under-
stood. Historically, obesity was thought to result in increased left
ventricle (LV) mass and cavity size as a compensatory response
to volume overload, leading to eventual eccentric remodeling.4
However, more recent data have suggested that increased
adiposity is associated with concentric LV remodeling charac-
terizedbyincreasedmass-to-volumeratio(concentricity),LVwall
thickness, and eventual diastolic dysfunction.5 These structural
abnormalities may lead to an increased risk for symptomatic
heart failure (HF), especially HF from concentric LV remodeling
and diastolic dysfunction, which is strongly associated with
excess adiposity and is increasing in prevalence.6-8
Traditionally, body mass index (BMI) has been the recom-
mended adiposity-related biomarker for identifying individuals
at increased risk for CVD, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and all-
cause mortality.1 However, there are several limitations of
BMI that have been recently described.9 Although higher BMI
clearly identifies individuals at increased risk of mortality,
those who are only mildly obese may have lower or similar
mortality compared with normal-weight individuals.10,11 Addi-
tionally, BMI has never been incorporated into traditional CVD
risk scores including Framingham12 or the Pooled Cohort
Equation because it has not been shown to identify increased
risk over traditional risk factors.13 We previously found
stronger correlations between waist circumference (WC) and

 index of central obesity with abdominal visceral adipose
tissue (VAT) in a randomized trial.14 In the Dallas Heart Study,
the correlation between BMI and a direct imaging-based
assessment of VAT is q=0.58 compared with WC and VAT
(q=0.73). Among those with obesity, the correlation between
BMI and VAT is even lower (q=0.12). Further studies have
shown that WC is a better predictor than BMI of total body fat,
which is correlated with multiple metabolic risk factors.15
Because of the limitations of BMI, it is imperative to evaluate
the relationship between alternative indices representing
centralized adiposity and cardiac morphology and function.
Previous studies have primarily examined the cross-
sectional relationship between measures of adiposity and
cardiac morphology.2,5,16,17 These static measurements do not
permit evaluation of the dynamic impact of body mass and fat
distribution changes on alterations in cardiac structure and
function over time, which may be critical determinants for HF
risk. Although weight loss has been associated with decreases
in LV mass and concentricity by cardiac magnetic resonance
imaging,18 data on longitudinal changes in broader metrics of
adiposity and their effects on multiple aspects of cardiac
remodeling remain limited. Therefore, we investigated the
longitudinal impact of changes in multiple indices of adiposity
(both generalized and central) with magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) measures of LV mass and end-diastolic volume,
concentricity (mass-to-volume), wall thickness, and ejection
fraction (EF) over �7 years of follow-up in a large, multiethnic
cohort of adults without clinical heart failure or LV dysfunction.
Methods
Study Population
The Dallas Heart Study (DHS) is a multiethnic population-
based cohort study of Dallas county adults with intentional
oversampling of blacks. Detailed methods of the DHS have
been described previously.19 A participant flow diagram for
the current study is provided in Figure 1. Briefly, between
2000 and 2002, participants underwent multimodality imag-
ing including detailed assessments of body composition,
indices of fat distribution, and measures of cardiac structure
and function. All measures were repeated between 2007 and
2008. For the present study, participants with prevalent CVD
(defined as self-reported coronary heart disease, ischemic
stroke, transient ischemic attack, or clinical HF), asymp-
tomatic LV dysfunction (LVEF <50%), human immunodefi-
ciency virus infection, cancer diagnosis, chronic kidney
disease at baseline, or missing imaging data at baseline or
follow-up were excluded, yielding a final sample size of 1262.
There were no significant differences in age, sex, or race
between those included and those excluded in this study.
Participants provided written informed consent, and the
protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.
Demographics, lifestyle, and other risk factors were
determined from a baseline questionnaire. Ethnicity was
self-assigned in accordance with US census categories.
Hypertension was defined as BP ≥140/90 mm Hg or taking
antihypertensive medication(s). Diabetes mellitus was defined
as a fasting serum glucose ≥126 mg/dL, self-reported
diabetes mellitus, or taking hypoglycemic medication. Hyper-
cholesterolemia was defined as a calculated low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol ≥160 mg/dL on a fasting sample,
direct low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥160 mg/dL on a
nonfasting sample, total cholesterol ≥240 mg/dL, or use of
statin medication. Smoking was defined as cigarette use

Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This study investigates the impact of longitudinal changes in
several indices of adiposity and their association with
measures of cardiac remodeling assessed by magnetic
resonance imaging in a large, multiethnic cohort of adults
over 7 years of follow-up.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Both increasing generalized and central adiposity over time
were associated with concentric cardiac remodeling inde-
pendent of baseline adiposity, suggesting that maintaining
weight stability and avoidance of weight gain may be an
important preventative strategy to prevent pathologic
cardiac remodeling.

 within the previous 30 days and/or a lifetime history of
having smoked ≥100 cigarettes. Alcohol use was determined
in grams/week by self-report. Physical activity was derived
using self-reported frequency and type of leisure-time physical
activity and a standard conversion for metabolic equivalence
units. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resis-
tance index was calculated with the following: (fasting insulin
[lIU/mL]9fasting glucose [mmol/L]) divided by 22.5.20 High-
sensitivity C-reactive protein, cardiac troponin T, and N-
terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were measured as
previously described.21 Interval development of comorbid
conditions was determined from self-report, medication
history, clinical assessment, and hospital records reporting
and was adjudicated by a clinical end point committee.
Body Weight and Indices of Fat Distribution
Weight and height were measured by standard scales. BMI was
calculated as weight (kilograms) divided by the square of height
(meters). WC was measured 1 cm above the iliac crest, and hip
circumference was measured at the widest circumference of
the buttocks at the area of the greater trochanters. Waist-hip
ratio was calculated as the ratio of WC/hip circumference. The
index of central obesity, constructed to account for race- and
sex-specific cutoffs for WC reflecting variability in average
heights in these populations, was calculated as WC (cm)
divided by height (cm).22 Visceral adiposity index was calcu-
lated
by
(WC/39.68)+(1.889BMI)9(Triglycerides/1.03)9
(1.31/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) for men and (WC/
36.58)+(1.899BMI)9(TG/0.81)9(1.52/high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol) for women.23 Obesity was defined as a BMI
≥30 kg/m2. Allometric height was defined as height (m)2.7.
Measures of Cardiac Structure and Function
Details of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging have been
previously described for baseline imaging24,25 and more
recently described for follow-up imaging.26 In brief, cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging was performed using 1 of 2
comparable 1.5-Tesla systems (Philips Medical System, Best,
The Netherlands) at baseline and a 3-Tesla system (Achieva,
Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) at follow-up.
At both time points, cine images were acquired using short-
axis, breath-hold, prospective electrocardiogram-gated turbo
field echo. Baseline and follow-up mass and volume mea-
surements were normalized to a phantom, which was imaged
on the 1.5-T and 3-T MRI systems. All images taken from both
baseline and follow-up time points were analyzed during the
same period with a standardized analysis protocol using
QMass software (Medis, Medical Imaging Systems, Leiden,
The Netherlands). LV mass, LV end-diastolic volume, LV wall
thickness, and LVEF reported here were calculated from
short-axis sequences, where papillary muscles were included
in LV mass and excluded from LV volume.26 There was no
difference in interstudy reproducibility (test/retest) between
the baseline and follow-up studies done at different field
strengths.27 Concentricity was defined as LV mass (g) divided
by LV volume (mL).
Statistical Analysis
Participants were stratified into 5 categories based on
clinically meaningful thresholds of weight change1 defined as
net change in weight from baseline to follow-up: >10% weight
loss, 5% to 10% weight loss, <5% weight loss or gain, 5% to 10%
weight gain, and >10% weight gain. Baseline characteristics
were compared across groups using chi-squared tests for
dichotomous variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for
continuous variables. Histograms were constructed to assess
the distribution of change in measures of cardiac structure and
function from baseline to follow-up across categories of weight
and waist circumference change. Multivariable linear regres-
sion modeling was performed with the cardiac measurement
at follow-up as the dependent variable and baseline cardiac
measurement and change in the adiposity measurement as the
independent variables. Standardized b coefficients were used
to allow comparability of the magnitude of the association
across models. The standardized b coefficient represents the
standard-deviation unit change in cardiac structure or function
per 1 standard deviation increase in the adiposity parameter.
Adiposity change exposure variables were categorized into
those representing generalized obesity (body weight and BMI)
and those representing central obesity (waist circumference,
waist/hip ratio, index of central obesity, and visceral adiposity
index). Outcome variables included change in LV mass and LV
end-diastolic volume (indexed to height), concentricity index,
LV wall thickness, and LVEF. Models were sequentially
adjusted for the baseline cardiac variable, then additionally
for age, sex, race, prevalent hypertension and diabetes
mellitus, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol use, and
the baseline adiposity variable, and then additionally for the
interim development of hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
hyperlipidemia, new smoking, or incident CVD. Heterogeneity
of effect by sex, race (black/nonblack), obesity status,
baseline adiposity, and other factors in the models was
assessed. Sensitivity analyses were performed after substi-
tuting systolic blood pressure and antihypertensive medication
use for hypertension status, separately excluding those with
antihypertension medication use, an interim weight loss
intervention such as bariatric surgery, and excluding the
2.5% tails of distribution of each outcome. For all statistical
testing, a 2-sided P<0.05 was considered statistically signif-
icant. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS
version 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

 Results
Among the 1262 participants meeting study criteria, mean
age was 44 years, and 57% were women, 44% black, and
36% obese at baseline. Baseline characteristics stratified by
weight change category are presented in Table 1. Over a
median 6.8 years of follow-up (IQR 6.3-7.3), 41% of partic-
ipants gained clinically significant (>5%) weight, in contrast
with 15% of participants who lost clinically significant (>5%)
weight over the follow-up period. Those who gained >10% of
body weight gained a median of 11 kg, whereas those who
lost >10% of body weight lost a median of 14 kg. Greater
weight
gain
was
associated
with
younger
age,
fewer
prevalent risk factors, less baseline adiposity, lower systolic
blood pressure, triglycerides, homeostasis model assess-
ment of insulin resistance, and higher high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol at baseline and with lower LV mass, wall
thickness, and concentricity at baseline (P<0.05 for each,
Table 1). Gain in WC was associated with similar character-
istics
(Table 2).
Changes
in
BMI
were
only
modestly
correlated with changes in WC over the study period both
in the overall population and when restricted to those with
obesity (q=0.61, P<0.0001).
Changes in characteristics of the study population from
baseline to follow-up, stratified by weight change category,
are presented in Table 3. Greater weight gain was associated
with greater increases in systolic and mean blood pressure,
triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total choles-
terol, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance,
and C-reactive protein; and greater decreases in high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic
peptide over time (P<0.05 for each, Table 3). Among those
with significant weight loss, there was a general decrease in
LV mass over time that lessened in magnitude among those
with minimal weight change or weight gain; in contrast, those
who gained >10% of their baseline body weight had �3%
increase in LV mass (P-trend<0.0001, Figure 2A). Similarly,
LV wall thickness and concentricity index increased across
categories of weight and WC change (P-trend<0.0001 and P-
trend=0.0026, respectively, Figure 2B and 2C).
In multivariable linear regression analyses adjusting for
baseline age, sex, race, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, weight, and the
baseline cardiac variable, increasing weight remained signif-
icantly associated with larger LV mass (b=0.10, P<0.0001),
LV wall thickness (b=0.10, P<0.0001), and LV concentricity
(b=0.07, P=0.0010), with more modest effects on LV end-
diastolic volume (LVEDV) (b=0.04, P=0.0454) and EF (b=0.05,
P=0.0438) (Table 4). Further adjustment for interim comor-
bidities did not materially alter the results. Similar results
were seen for BMI (Table 5). Among all analyzed model
covariates, the baseline cardiac parameter and change in
body weight were the only variables independently associated
with all measures of cardiac structural and functional changes
over time. Further analysis to investigate the possibility of a
clinical threshold of weight change on changes in concen-
tricity using continuous, adjusted-splines modeling showed
that any weight loss was associated with a decrease in
concentricity and that any weight gain up to �20% was
associated with increased concentricity (Figure 3). Because
there were very few data points beyond a 20% weight change,
it is unclear if further increases in weight would impact
additional concentricity change.
In separate models assessing changes in WC, increasing
WC was also associated with higher LV mass (b=0.07,
P<0.0001), LV wall thickness (b=0.08, P<0.0001), and
concentricity (b=0.07, P=0.0007) over time; however, no
relation was seen between WC change and change in LVEDV
(P=0.4439) or EF (P=0.6038) (Table 4). Results were similar
with index of central obesity and visceral adiposity index
(Table 5). Changes in waist-hip ratio were not independently
associated with change in any cardiac parameters (Table 5).
Results remained significant even after adjustment for
multiple testing using the Bonferroni correction, except for
those between adiposity and LV volumes and EF. Additional
adjustment for BMI change in models of waist circumference
change attenuated the relationship between changes in waist
circumference and cardiac parameters. Results were insensi-
tive to substituting systolic blood pressure and antihyperten-
sive medication use for hypertension status, to excluding
participants taking antihypertension medications at baseline
or follow-up, to excluding individuals who had a medical
weight loss intervention such as bariatric surgery between
baseline and follow-up (n=20), and to excluding the 2.5% tails
of distribution for each outcome to exclude an outlier effect.
Additional sensitivity analyses were performed by indexing LV
mass and end-diastolic volume to body surface area instead
of allometric height, and results were unchanged.
When multivariable models evaluating the relationship of
changes in body weight with changes in cardiac structure and
function were stratified by sex, results were directionally
consistent. However, the magnitude of effect appeared
greater among women compared with men for LV mass (b
[95%CI]: 0.11 [0.06, 0.15] for women versus 0.07 [0.02, 0.12]
for men), with no statistically significant interactions seen by
sex or race (black/nonblack). A significant interaction was
seen by obesity status such that the association of weight
change on LV wall thickness was greater among nonobese
compared
with
obese
individuals
at
baseline
(b=0.11,
P<0.0001 versus b=0.08, P=0.0090; respectively; P-interac-
tion=0.0129). There were no statistically significant interac-
tions seen by age, hypertension or diabetes mellitus status,
physical activity, smoking, or alcohol use. Furthermore, we did
not find a statistical interaction between baseline adiposity

 and adiposity change on the cardiac MRI outcomes. This
suggests that the association of adiposity change on cardiac
MRI parameters is consistent across all groups irrespective of
the baseline adiposity/relative obesity.
Discussion
Principal Findings
In a large, multiethnic cohort of adults, we observed a
dynamic relationship between changes in multiple indices of
adiposity and LV remodeling over 7 years of follow-up. Both
increasing generalized and central adiposity over time were
associated with pathologic cardiac remodeling independent of
baseline adiposity. There did not appear to be a threshold for
concentricity change by weight change: any amount of weight
loss was associated with a decrease in concentricity, and any
weight gain up to �20% was associated with increased
concentricity. Sensitivity analysis across subgroups of sex,
race, and obesity status showed directionally consistent
results. We did observe minor differences in the subpheno-
type of adiposity change: increasing generalized obesity,
represented by body weight and BMI, was associated with
increased LV mass, LV wall thickness, and concentricity, with
a more modest effect on LVEDV and EF; whereas increasing
central adiposity over time, represented by WC, index of
central obesity, and visceral adiposity index was associated
with concentric remodeling but not with volume or EF. These
results suggest that concentric remodeling is the predominant
phenotype linked to increasing adiposity in middle aged
adults, and extends prior cross-sectional data in a similar
population that found that obesity was associated with
concentric LV remodeling without much change in EF.5
In Context of Current Literature
Previous studies in community-based cohorts examining the
relationship between longitudinal changes in adiposity and LV
morphology have primarily focused on limited measures of
adiposity and used echocardiography as the imaging modal-
ity. In general, studies have shown a positive correlation
between increased adiposity and certain aspects of cardiac
remodeling. For example, in a substudy of the CARDIA
(Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) Study
with 1358 participants, increasing BMI longitudinally over
10 years was associated with increased LV mass by 2-
dimensionally guided M-mode echocardiography.17 A larger
study from CARDIA using echocardiography showed that
change in BMI over 25 years was consistently associated
with
increased
LV
mass,
LVEDV,
and
LV
end-systolic
volume.28 Two studies from the Framingham Heart Study
using over 4000 participants also showed that BMI change
over a 16-year period was associated with increased LV
mass, LV wall thickness, LV systolic and diastolic dimensions
with 2-dimensional echocardiography.29,30 Although 2-dimen-
sional echocardiography is the most commonly used method
for these assessments in clinical practice, the accuracy and
reproducibility of this technique have significant limita-
tions.31,32 Standard 2-dimensional echocardiography may
underestimate LVEDV compared with contrast-enhanced and
3-dimensional echocardiography and MRI,32 making MRI the
standard for accurate for volumetric assessments. A recent

Impact of Adiposity Changes on Cardiac Structure

 study from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) with
2351 participants showed that weight loss over 9 years was
associated with decreases in LV mass and concentricity using
MRI; however, outcomes did not include LV volume, wall
thickness, or EF; and exposures did not included indices of
centralized obesity such as waist circumference.18 Although
many different cardiac structural phenotypes are inter-
related, in many circumstances, heterogeneity of phenotypes
allows for more precise identification of pathologic remodel-
ing and associates with varying outcomes. For example, in
the 4-tiered classification of LV hypertrophy, classification by
differing LV wall thickness, volumes, and concentricity
stratifies LV hypertrophy into subgroups with differential risk
for adverse cardiovascular outcomes.33 Therefore, we believe
that describing the associations of adiposity changes with
multiple measures of cardiac remodeling is important and
novel. Although the variability of EF in a normal population
varies minimally when measured in a cross-sectional fashion,
longitudinal changes in EF may occur and provide additional
information on change in cardiac function over time. Our
study
extends
the
observations
from
prior
studies
to
additional cardiac phenotypes and is the first study to our
knowledge to report the relationships between longitudinal
changes in both generalized and central adiposity with
dynamic changes in multiple measures of cardiac remodeling
over time using MRI.
In contrast to our study and a prior study from MESA5 in
which a concentric remodeling phenotype was predominant
for
all
adiposity
measures,
the
Bogalusa
Heart
Study
concluded that increases in indices of both generalized and
central adiposity were associated with eccentric LV hypertro-
phy but not concentric remodeling using echocardiography.34
One possible explanation for the disparate findings between
studies may be due to the different demographics of the study
populations:
mean
age
22 years
and
majority
white
participants in the Bogalusa Heart study compared with mean
age 44 years and �50% black in the DHS. Moreover, in our
study and in MESA, participants had higher rates of hyper-
tension, an established driver of concentric remodeling.
However, associations with higher concentricity remained
after adjustment for hypertension or systolic blood pressure.
Differences in pubertal and hormonal status in the Bogalusa
study compared with the current study may also contribute to
the differences in cardiac remodeling patterns observed. It is
also possible that the effects of obesity are conditioned on
time such that excess adiposity early in life leads to eccentric
LV enlargement due to higher circulating blood volume and
cardiac output but that there is a subsequent shift toward
concentric remodeling/hypertrophy with increasing age and
vascular remodeling. In fact, concentric remodeling/hyper-
trophy is the most prevalent LV structural abnormality among
obese patients with heart failure35 and is associated with a
high risk for adverse cardiovascular events and death.36
Excess adiposity may influence LV remodeling by a variety
of mechanisms including endothelial dysfunction,37 inflam-
matory
cytokines,38
neurohormonal
alterations,39
and
myocardial fibrosis.40 These mechanisms lead to pathologic
LV remodeling,4,11 and eventually heart failure.2 Variation in
body fat distribution may be an important determinant of
cardiac remodeling,41 and excess fat storage in the visceral
depot may expose the heart to a different inflammatory and
metabolic milieu than fat stored in the subcutaneous depot.42
We previously reported that visceral adiposity was indepen-
dently associated with concentric LV remodeling, whereas
lower-body subcutaneous fat was linked to a more eccentric
phenotype.41 Although the cardiac remodeling phenotypes
were generally similar between body weight and WC in this
study, it is possible that WC is an insufficient surrogate for
detecting changes in cardiac risk related to visceral adipos-
ity.43 As mentioned above, in the DHS, the correlation

visceral fat correlation among all DHS participants was 0.73,
and among obese participants the WC–visceral fat correlation
was lower at 0.46. Furthermore, WC measures include both
VAT and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue compart-

are associated with a different cardiometabolic risk profile.42

 associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus,44 hypertension,45
and alterations in left ventricular structure and function.41
Moreover, when visceral fat was replaced with WC in a
predictive model of type 2 diabetes mellitus, WC was not
significantly associated with the outcome.44 In summary,
although we did not find major differences between the
effects of generalized versus central adiposity in this study,
more detailed and precise imaging-based assessments of
adipose depots are required to further delineate the indepen-
dent effects of varying depots on cardiac structure and
function over time.
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of the current study include phenotyping with
multiple indices of adiposity, using a more accurate method
of imaging for cardiac structure with MRI, a racially diverse
sample of adults applicable to the general population, and
serial assessment of body fat distribution and LV morphol-
ogy. Several limitations merit comment. Because all of our
participants were free of clinically apparent CVD at baseline,
participants represent a relatively healthy population-based
sample, and results may not be applicable to those with
established CVD. Second, we were unable to report on more
precise imaging phenotypes of adiposity such as visceral or
abdominal subcutaneous fat. Further studies are needed to
examine the effects of longitudinal changes in precise
imaging based assessments of fat depots on LV remodeling.
Third, because our study cohort did not include South or
East Asians, the results may not be generalizable to these
racial/ethnic groups. Fourth, there may have been other
factors/unmeasured confounders that could have influenced
both adiposity and cardiac structural changes over time such
as dietary habits that we are unable to account for in this
study.
Clinical Implications
Our findings may have potential important implications for the
prevention and treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and heart
failure. They may be particularly important for individuals at
higher risk for diastolic dysfunction because concentric
remodeling and hypertrophy are central to the pathophysiology
of impaired LV relaxation and failure.46 Avoidance of weight

 gain may delay or prevent progression of diastolic dysfunction.
Furthermore, counseling to maintain weight stability, even in
the absence of weight loss, may be an important preventive
strategy among high-risk individuals. Our findings further
support the importance of preventing obesity as primary
prevention for concentric remodeling and eventual HF.
Conclusion
In a multiethnic cohort of adults without heart failure, we
observed that increasing adiposity over time was associated
with pathologic cardiac remodeling assessed by MRI, inde-
pendent of baseline adiposity. Concentric remodeling was the
predominant phenotype linked to increasing adiposity. Further
studies are needed to determine whether aggressive weight
management strategies can improve adverse cardiac remod-
eling, diastolic dysfunction, and heart failure in individuals at
high risk for weight gain.
