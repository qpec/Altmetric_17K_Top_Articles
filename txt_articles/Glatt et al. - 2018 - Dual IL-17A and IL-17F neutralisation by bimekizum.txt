AbstrACt
Objective Interleukin (IL)-17A has emerged as 
pivotal in driving tissue pathology in immune-mediated 
inflammatory diseases. the role of IL-17F, sharing 50% 
sequence homology and overlapping biological function, 
remains less clear. We hypothesised that IL-17F, together 
with IL-17A, contributes to chronic tissue inflammation, 
and that dual neutralisation may lead to more profound 
suppression of inflammation than inhibition of IL-17A 
alone.
Methods preclinical experiments assessed the role 
of IL-17A and IL-17F in tissue inflammation using 
disease-relevant human cells. A placebo-controlled 
proof-of-concept (poC) clinical trial randomised 
patients with psoriatic arthritis (psA) to bimekizumab 
(n=39) or placebo (n=14). Safety, pharmacokinetics 
and clinical efficacy of multiple doses (weeks 0, 3, 
6 (240 mg/160 mg/160 mg; 80 mg/40 mg/40 mg; 
160 mg/80 mg/80 mg and 560 mg/320 mg/320 mg)) of 
bimekizumab, a humanised monoclonal IgG1 antibody 
neutralising both IL-17A and IL-17F, were investigated.
results IL-17F induced qualitatively similar 
inflammatory responses to IL-17A in skin and joint cells. 
neutralisation of IL-17A and IL-17F with bimekizumab 
more effectively suppressed in vitro cytokine responses 
and neutrophil chemotaxis than inhibition of IL-17A or 
IL-17F alone. the poC trial met both prespecified efficacy 
success criteria and showed rapid, profound responses 
in both joint and skin (pooled top three doses vs placebo 
at week 8: American College of rheumatology 20% 
response criteria 80.0% vs 16.7% (posterior probability 
>99%); psoriasis Area and Severity Index 100% 
response criteria 86.7% vs 0%), sustained to week 20, 
without unexpected safety signals.
Conclusions these data support IL-17F as a key driver 
of human chronic tissue inflammation and the rationale 
for dual neutralisation of IL-17A and IL-17F in psA and 
related conditions.

IntrOduCtIOn
Pro-inflammatory 
cytokines 
such 
as 
tumour 
necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) are 
key drivers of chronic tissue inflammation and are 
well-validated therapeutic targets in a variety of 
immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.1–3 More 
recently, IL-17A was identified as a driver of joint 
and skin inflammation, with preclinical promise 
translating to success with anti-IL-17A inhibitors 
for the treatment of diseases such as psoriasis (PSO), 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondy-
litis.4 5 Nevertheless, complete remission remains 
rare and many patients respond only partially, or 
not at all, to treatment blocking these cytokines. 
Therefore, we hypothesised that novel dual-cyto-
kine blockade may have a more profound impact 
on chronic tissue inflammation than targeting 
IL-17A alone.
IL-17A shares greater than 50% structural 
homology and overlapping biological function with 
another IL-17 family member, IL-17F.6 7 Both cyto-
kines are expressed by the same cell types, including 
Th17 cells, γδ-T cells and innate lymphoid cells; can be 
secreted as homodimers or IL-17A–IL-17F heterodi-
mers;8 9 and signal through the same IL-17RA/RC 
receptor complex. IL-17A and IL-17F are both upreg-
ulated in a variety of inflamed human tissues10–13 and 
co-operate with other pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
such as TNF, to amplify inflammatory responses.14 
Together, these observations led us to hypothesise 
that IL-17F, in addition to IL-17A, contributes to 
chronic tissue inflammation in humans, and that dual 
neutralisation of IL-17A and IL-17F could result in a 
more profound suppression of inflammation both in 
vitro and in vivo.
We tested this hypothesis in vitro using human 
joint and skin cells, and we also conducted a proof-
of-concept (PoC) trial in patients with PsA, evaluating 
bimekizumab (formerly UCB4940), a humanised 
monoclonal IgG1 antibody (mAb) that potently and 
selectively neutralises the biological function of both 
human IL-17A and IL-17F, versus placebo.

analysis using TaqMan gene expression assays (ThermoFisher) 
for IL-17A (Hs00174383_m1), IL-17F (Hs00369400_m1) and 
GAPDH (4310884E) according to the manufacturer’s protocol 
(online supplementary information).
Characterisation of the anti-IL-17 antibodies’ affinities for human 
IL-17A and IL-17F
Biomolecular interaction analysis was performed using a Biacore 
3000 (Biacore AB). Bimekizumab and the anti-IL-17A antibody 
were affinity-matched for binding IL-17A whereas bimekizumab 
has a higher affinity for IL-17F than the anti-IL-17F antibody 
(generated in house at UCB Pharma); however, it was used at 
maximal concentrations in all blockade assays (online supple-
mentary table s1).
In vitro effects of recombinant IL-17F on normal human dermal 
fibroblasts and synoviocytes from patients with psoriatic arthritis
Cells (online supplementary information) were stimulated for 
 
24 hours with recombinant IL-17A (50 ng/mL), IL-17F 
 
(50 ng/mL) or both (50 ng/mL each) in the presence of TNF 
 
(1 ng/mL). In synoviocytes from patients with PsA, protein levels 
of secreted IL-6, IL-8 and MMP3 were measured using standard 
ELISA technique (kits CT205, Ucyteck, the Netherlands (IL-6); 
CT212, Ucyteck, the Netherlands (IL-8); DY513, R&D systems, 
UK (MMP3)). In normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs), 
protein levels of secreted IL-8 were measured by Luminex (R&D 
Systems, Cat No. LUH208).
Synoviocyte/primary normal human dermal fibroblasts blockade 
experiments
Blood CD4+CD45RO+CCR6+CXCR3− Th17 cells sorted from 
healthy donors were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 
for 96 
hours (online supplementary information). Th17 super-
natant was added (as 1:10 dilution) to synoviocytes or NHDFs 
(online supplementary information) alone, or in combination 
with 10 
µg/mL anti-IL-17A, anti-IL-17F, bimekizumab, anti-TNF 
or A33 IgG control antibody for 24 
hours.
Pathway-focused gene array was conducted in normal synov-
iocytes and primary NHDFs to profile the expression of 360 
inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and their receptors, as well 
as genes involved in cytokine–cytokine receptor interactions, 
many of which are linked to IL-17/IL-23 biology, including IL-6 
and IL-8. Inflammatory mediator levels were quantified using 
a Luminex 30-plex cytokine/chemokine array (Thermo Fisher 
LHC6003) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Chemotaxis assay
Neutrophils were derived from whole blood from healthy 
donors following a red cell lysis step (Thermofisher A1049201) 
then resuspended at a concentration of 107 
cells/mL in DMEM; 
200 
mL was applied to the upper chamber of a 5-µm transwell 
(24-well format), 6.5 
mm membrane. Diluted Th17 superna-
tant (500 
µL) was placed in the lower transwell chamber to act 
as chemo-attractant. Co-cultures were incubated for 5 
hours 
at 37°C in a 5% CO2 culture incubator and migrated neutro-
phils (CD18 FITC) were enumerated using flow cytometry 
(BD Fortessa X20). Further details on the chemotaxis assay are 
provided in the online supplementary information.
Clinical methods
Study design
PA0007 was a phase 1b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled, PoC study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) 
and clinical efficacy of multiple doses of bimekizumab in patients 
with PsA (NCT02141763). The study was conducted in accor-
dance with the applicable regulatory and International Council 
for Harmonisation, Good Clinical Practice requirements, the 
ethical principles originating in the Declaration of Helsinki and 
local laws. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the 
relevant ethics committees. All patients provided documented 
consent prior to study entry. The study was conducted at three 
sites, one each in the Republic of Moldova, the UK and Bulgaria, 
between June 2014 and August 2015.
Patients were randomised to one of five treatment regimens: 
intravenous administration on three separate occasions (weeks 
0, 3 and 6) of one of the following dose regimens or matched 
placebo:
1. bimekizumab 240 
mg/160 
mg/160 
mg (n=21)
2. bimekizumab 80 
mg/40 
mg/40 
mg (n=6)
3. bimekizumab 160 
mg/80 
mg/80 
mg (n=6)
4. bimekizumab 560 
mg/320 
mg/320 
mg (n=6)
Concomitant medication was permitted, with adjustments 
allowed after week 8.
The 
cohort 
of 
patients 
receiving 
bimekizumab 
240 
mg/160 
mg/160 
mg or placebo (intravenous; n=3) was 
administered treatment first; the remaining three cohorts 
received bimekizumab or placebo (intravenous; n=3) in parallel 
following safety and PK reviews of the 240 
mg/160 
mg/160 
mg 
cohort. Patients were randomised via interactive response tech-
nology; the randomisation schedule was produced by the clinical 
research organisation; no stratification factors were used in the 
process. Details on maintenance of study blind and changes to 
the planned study protocol are provided in the online supple-
mentary information.
Patients
Key inclusion criteria: male or female, ≥18 years at screening; 
diagnosis of adult-onset PsA ≥6 months prior to screening, 
classified according to the Classification Criteria for 
PsA (CASPAR); active psoriatic lesions or history of skin PSO; 
active arthritis as defined by ≥3 tender joints and ≥3 swollen 
joints at screening and baseline, and either erythrocyte sedi-
mentation rate of ≥28 mm/hour or high sensitivity C reactive 
protein >3 mg/L; inadequate response to ≥1 non-biological 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD, including 
methotrexate) and/or one approved biological DMARD; and

of screening. Key exclusion criteria: inadequate response to >1 
approved biological DMARD (no specific medication detailed); 
absolute neutrophil count <1.50×109/L and/or lymphocyte 
count <1.00×109/L.
Assessments
Primary safety endpoints assessed during the study included 
incidence and types of adverse events (AEs); clinical laboratory 
measurements and vital signs; echocardiogram; physical exam-
ination. Primary PK analyses included Cmax, CmaxSS, CminSS, area 
under the curve (AUC)tau, tmax, CL and V
. Exploratory efficacy 
endpoints included American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 
scores; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI); physician’s 
global assessment of disease activity (PGA); patient’s global 
assessment of disease activity (PtGA, using a visual analogue 
scale). Efficacy endpoints were evaluated during screening, base-
line and weeks 1 (PASI and PGA only), 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 
20. Blood samples for determining the plasma concentration 
of bimekizumab and anti-bimekizumab antibodies were taken

Figure 1 IL-17F contributes to inflammation and bimekizumab demonstrates superior efficacy relative to inhibition of IL-17A or IL-17F alone. 
Recombinant IL-17A and IL-17F, with or without TNF, were used to activate either (A) PsA synoviocytes (n=2) or (B) NHDFs (n=4), and IL-8 release 
was assessed following overnight culture. To evaluate the individual and collective influence of IL-17A and IL-17F, (C) PsA synoviocytes (n=4), (D, F, 
G) primary NHDFs (n=4) or (E) normal synoviocytes (n=5) were stimulated with Th17 supernatant with or without IL-17-specific blocking antibodies. 
Following overnight culture, either (C, D) inhibition of IL-8 production, (E, F) gene transcriptional changes or (G) inhibition of chemotactic potential 
was evaluated. For transcriptional analysis (E, F), genes were normalised to GAPDH mRNA and expressed as relative fold changes compared with 
unstimulated cells. For primary NHDFs, the panel presents genes that had a fold change ≥3 for Th17 stimulation under IgG conditions. Values were 
subject to conditional formatting (three colour scale: maximum value—red, minimum value—green, median value—yellow) for each target gene 
across groups. The same genes were analysed for normal synoviocytes and the conditional formatting was applied for genes expressing a fold 
change ≥3. Data are mean ±SEM. Figures are representative of three independent experiments. *represents a significant reduction versus IgG control,

Clinical and epidemiological research
throughout the study; concentration of anti-drug antibodies was 
an exploratory endpoint.
Statistical analysis
For the blockade experiments in synoviocytes and primary 
NHDFs, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Fish-
er's least significant difference (LSD) post-hoc test was used to 
assess overall differences between the groups and IgG control. A 
one-tailed paired t-test was chosen for the comparison between 
the anti-IL-17A and bimekizumab groups. Mean and standard 
error of the mean (SEM) were presented.
As predefined in the analysis plan, data from the three highest 
bimekizumab dose groups were pooled (the lowest dose group 
was expected to produce suboptimal efficacy and was therefore 
only included in the safety and PK data sets) and all placebo data 
were also pooled for summary and statistical inference purposes.
A sample size of 50 was deemed sufficient to meet the primary 
study objectives (safety, tolerability and PK), and to detect a 
difference of the pooled treatment group from pooled placebo 
group in ACRn with >90% probability based on a frequen-
tist approach. In terms of ACR20, this power is based on an 
approximate target effect of 70% for bimekizumab and 25% for 
placebo.
The analyses of ACRn and ACR20 at week 8 followed the 
Bayesian paradigm to improve the operating characteristics of 
the study design. The Bayesian methodology was used for the 
analysis of ACRn and ACR20 at week 8 assuming informative 
priors only on the placebo response (vague prior distributions 
were assumed for all other parameters). For both endpoints, 
the prior placebo response, in terms of ACR20 response rate, 
was approximately 25% and the effective sample size was 32. 
Normal likelihood model and logistic model were assumed for 
ACRn and ACR20, respectively.
T
wo study efficacy criteria were predefined based on ACRn at 
week 8. For declaring PoC, we required a high (≥97.5%) poste-
rior probability that bimekizumab is superior to placebo. To give 
further confidence about the effect size, the posterior probability 
that bimekizumab improvement over placebo exceeds a clinically 
relevant effect (ie, approximately 25% difference from placebo 
in ACR20 terms) was required to be ≥70%. The clinically rele-
vant effect was determined after assessment of the efficacy data 
from a TNF inhibitor clinical study (NCT01087788).15 For ease 
of interpretation, posterior estimates and 95% credible intervals 
(CrI) for ACR20 only are presented.
Further details on the statistical methods are described in 
online supplementary information.

Preclinical methods
IL-17F was expressed in disease-relevant cells and triggered a 
qualitatively similar inflammatory response to IL-17A
Several expression studies have established the presence of not 
only IL-17A but also IL-17F protein in lesional psoriatic skin.16 17 
We detected both IL-17A and IL-17F in synovial tissue from 
patients with PsA using mRNA expression analysis, supporting a 
potential contribution of IL-17F to the immunopathology of PsA 
(online supplementary figure s1).
Because the receptor complex for IL-17A and IL-17F 
(IL-17RA and IL-17RC) is expressed in psoriatic skin16 and in 
synovitis,18–20 we next investigated whether IL-17F triggers a 
pro-inflammatory response in PsA synoviocytes and NHDFs. 
Whereas neither IL-17A nor IL-17F substantially induced acti-
vation of PsA synoviocytes by themselves, both IL-17 family 
members induced significantly greater production of key pro-in-
flammatory mediators such as IL-8 (figure 1A) and IL-6 (online 
supplementary figure s2) when synoviocytes were stimulated in 
the presence of TNF, with IL-17F being less potent than IL-17A. 
In primary NHDFs, amplification of IL-8 production was 
also observed following stimulation with recombinant IL-17A 
and IL-17F in the presence of TNF (figure 1B). Collectively, 
these data indicate that IL-17A and IL-17F are co-expressed

Clinical and epidemiological research
in disease-relevant cells of patients with PsA and that, similar 
to IL-17A, IL-17F triggers a pro-inflammatory response in key 
effector cells from these tissues.
Dual neutralisation of IL-17A and IL-17F demonstrated greater 
suppression of synoviocyte and primary normal human dermal 
fibroblasts activation than blockade of IL-17A or IL-17F alone
To assess if IL-17F contributes to chronic tissue inflammation 
beyond IL-17A, synoviocytes from patients with PsA and primary 
NHDFs were stimulated with the supernatant from polyclonal 
human Th17 cells (online supplementary figure s3). Blockade of 
IL-17A alone significantly downregulated production by synov-
iocytes of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-8, whereas 
IL-17F blockade had no significant effect. Dual neutralisa-
tion of IL-17A and IL-17F by bimekizumab resulted in greater 
downregulation of IL-8 (28% lower; P<0.05) (figure 1C), 
IL-6 (42% lower; P<0.01) and MMP3 (44% lower; P=0.149) 
(online supplementary figure s4) than IL-17A blockade alone. 
Similar results were obtained when IL-17A and IL-17F were 
simultaneously neutralised by adding both single blocking anti-
bodies, suggesting that the superior effect of bimekizumab was 
due to more than simply potent blockade of IL-17A (figure 1C). 
Moreover, blockade by an anti-TNF antibody had only a modest 
impact in this model system (figure 1C).
A similar analysis using primary NHDFs confirmed that dual 
neutralisation of IL-17A and IL-17F by bimekizumab resulted in 
a greater reduction in IL-8 (57% lower; P<0.0001) (figure 1D) 
and IL-6 (28% lower; P<0.01) (online supplementary figure s4), 
compared with IL-17A blockade alone; single IL-17F blockade 
had only a minimal effect.

Clinical and epidemiological research
Transcriptional analysis in Th17-stimulated normal synov-
iocytes and primary NHDFs (figure 1E, F) confirmed that dual 
neutralisation of IL-17A and IL-17F with bimekizumab resulted 
in a more profound anti-inflammatory effect in a large panel 
of inflammation-linked genes, versus inhibition of IL-17A alone. 
To confirm this concept in a functional assay, we investigated 
changes in the chemotactic potential of neutrophils towards 
Th17-stimulated NHDFs. While single cytokine neutralisa-
tion of IL-17A or IL-17F suppressed migration of neutrophils 
compared with the isotype control IgG (figure 1G), significantly 
more inhibition of neutrophil migration was achieved when both 
IL-17A and IL-17F were neutralised by bimekizumab (online 
supplementary video s1).
Collectively, these in vitro data indicate, despite the inferior 
potency compared with IL-17A, that IL-17F has a role in driving 
inflammatory activation and that dual neutralisation of IL-17A 
and IL-17F more profoundly suppresses the inflammatory 
response of disease-relevant cells than blockade of IL-17A alone.
Clinical
Baseline disease characteristics, safety and pharmacokinetics
To assess the potential of dual IL-17A and IL-17F blockade in 
vivo, 53 of 80 patients screened for inclusion were randomised to 
treatment with bimekizumab (n=39), or placebo (n=14) for 20 
weeks; 50 patients completed the study (online supplementary

figure s5). Disease characteristics were representative for people 
with moderate-to-severe PsA (table 1). All patients received 
concomitant medication during the study; the most common 
were anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic products (100%), 
folic acid (59.6%) and analgesics (26.9%); 84.6% of patients 
received concomitant DMARDs.
Bimekizumab treatment was not associated with any unex-
pected safety signals; treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), the majority of which were mild or moderate (13 
(93%) patients in the placebo group and 36 (95%) patients 
in the total bimekizumab group), are summarised in table 2. 
Comparing across the individual bimekizumab groups, there was 
no apparent dose relationship with regard to the incidence of 
TEAEs. Three patients reported severe AEs (one ‘injuries caused 
by fall’ and one ‘muscle spasms’ in the bimekizumab treatment 
group; one ‘worsening of PsA’ in the placebo arm); no severe AEs 
were considered treatment related. One patient receiving bime-
kizumab reported three serious adverse events (SAEs) caused by 
a fall; none were considered treatment related. One orophar-
yngitis fungal infection and one vulvovaginal candida infection 
were reported in the bimekizumab arm (days 9 and 43 post 
 
infusion, respectively); both of these were mild, of short duration 
(≤20 days) and resolved with anti-fungal therapy. No patients 
discontinued because of TEAEs and there were no deaths. Mean 
plasma concentration–time profile data for bimekizumab are 
summarised in figure 2. Plasma concentrations of bimekizumab 
increased with dose in a linear and time-independent manner 
with linear clearance; the estimated t1/2 of bimekizumab was 24 
days.
Proof of concept: clinical efficacy of bimekizumab on joints and skin 
in patients with psoriatic arthritis
A summary of the clinical efficacy of the three highest dose 
groups of bimekizumab on measures of disease activity in joints 
and skin is presented in table 3. The prespecified efficacy success 
criteria of this study were met as Bayesian analysis indicated a 
>99% probability that joint response rates, as defined by ACRn 
and ACR20, at week 8 are greater with bimekizumab than with 
placebo (online supplementary table s2 and s3). Additionally, 
there was also a >99% probability that the ACRn and ACR20 
response rates with bimekizumab at week 8 exceeded a clinically 
relevant threshold (defined based on results from a TNF inhib-
itor clinical study (NCT01087788)).15 Therefore, both of the 
prespecified efficacy success criteria of this study were met.
Patients receiving bimekizumab had greater ACR20, ACR50 
and ACR70 joint response rates compared with placebo (table 
3). Response rates at the primary efficacy endpoint (week 8) 
were 80% (ACR20), 40% (ACR50) and 23% (ACR70); maximal 
observed response rates for these variables were 80% (ACR20 at 
week 8), 57% (ACR50 at week 12) and 37% (ACR70 at week 16) 
(figures 3A, B and C). A response was evident as early as week 
2 and maximal or near-maximal responses were maintained to 
 
week 20.
In patients with significant skin involvement (BSA≥3%), week 
8 response rates for PASI75 and PASI100 were 100% and 87%, 
respectively. As with the joint outcomes, there was a response as 
early as week 2, and maximal or near-maximal responses were 
maintained to week 20 (table 3; figure 3D and E).

PtGA and PGA demonstrated improvements from baseline 
within 2 
weeks of the first infusion for patients treated with 
bimekizumab versus placebo (online supplementary figure s6; 
table 3).
dIsCussIOn
A combined preclinical and clinical PoC approach was used 
to probe the hypothesis that not only IL-17A, but also IL-17F, 
contributes to chronic tissue inflammation, and that dual neutral-
isation of IL-17A and IL-17F by bimekizumab could profoundly 
suppress joint and skin inflammation in PsA. The rapid and 
marked improvements in joint and skin outcomes seen in this 
PoC study not only exceeded placebo but were superior in joints 
to a clinically relevant effect (based on the effect of current stan-
dard of care (SoC)).
Our preclinical data indicate that IL-17A and IL-17F are not 
only co-expressed in PsA target lesions, consistent with a recent 
report in the literature,21 but that IL-17F has a qualitatively 
similar pro-inflammatory effect to IL-17A on disease-relevant 
human tissue cells. Crucially, neither IL-17A nor IL-17F are 
potent inflammatory cytokines on their own, but rather co-op-
erate with other inflammatory mediators, including, but not 
restricted to, TNF.22 23 In addition, IL-17A was more potent than 
IL-17F in the activation of human synoviocytes and primary 
NHDFs; however, the implications of this should be considered 
in the context of observations that levels of IL-17F protein are 
32-fold higher than IL-17A in lesional psoriatic skin (317 vs 
 
9.8 
pg/mL).24 Collectively, these data suggest that while IL-17F 
may not play a dominant inflammatory role in the presence of 
high IL-17A levels, IL-17F may become relevant in complex 
cytokine micro-environments.
Supporting the hypothesis that IL-17F contributes to chronic 
tissue inflammation beyond IL-17A alone, we demonstrated that, 
in disease-relevant human cellular systems, dual neutralisation of 
IL-17A and IL-17F had a more profound impact on the inflam-
matory activation of synoviocytes and primary NHDFs by Th17 
cell supernatant than selective blockade of IL-17A alone. This was 
observed not only in terms of gene and protein expression but also 
translated to functional consequences, such as impact on neutro-
phil migration.
To examine the hypothesis that neutralisation of both IL-17A 
and IL-17F would lead to superior inhibition of inflammatory 
responses than blockade of IL-17A alone, the impact of cyto-
kine-specific antibodies on disease-relevant tissues stimulated 
with Th17-supernatant was assessed. As predicted, neutralisation 
of IL-17F when in the presence of sufficient quantities of IL-17A 
resulted in only modest inhibition of the inflammatory response, 
whereas IL-17A inhibition showed a marked effect. However, 
dual neutralisation of IL-17A and IL-17F with bimekizumab 
demonstrated superior neutralisation versus inhibition of IL-17A 
alone. Use of an affinity-matched anti-IL-17A combined with an 
anti-IL-17F selective antibody confirmed that the anti-inflamma-
tory effects of bimekizumab were due in part to the anti-IL-17F 
component and not simply a result of superior IL-17A blockade. 
The limited effect of IL-17F in the presence of IL-17A may explain 
why its pro-inflammatory role has been overlooked previously.
Because our recent single-ascending-dose phase I trial with 
bimekizumab in patients with mild PSO revealed no unexpected 
safety signals, and provided preliminary evidence of a profound 
effect on reduction of psoriatic lesions,25 we proceeded to assess 
the potential of bimekizumab in vivo in patients with PsA by 
conducting a PoC clinical trial. The trial did not reveal new safety 
signals; the majority of TEAEs, including neutropenia and liver 
transaminase elevations, were mild to moderate in intensity and 
resolved spontaneously. There were no cases of death, malig-
nancy or major cardiovascular events. There were three severe 
AEs and three SAEs, none of which were considered related to 
the treatment.
In the context of previous reports with anti-IL-17A and anti-
IL-17RA antibodies,26–28 it is important to note the absence of 
opportunistic infections (including tuberculosis), inflammatory 
bowel disease and suicide-related events in this trial. In line with 
the increased susceptibility for fungal infections emerging with 
anti-IL-17A antibodies, we observed two cases of candidiasis 
(oropharyngeal and vulvovaginal), both of which were mild and 
resolved with local treatment.
The clinical study met its predefined efficacy criterion, demon-
strating superiority of bimekizumab over both placebo and the 
predefined clinically relevant threshold using ACRn at week 8. 
Currently, anti-TNF therapy is considered the SoC biological 
treatment for PsA; therefore, the clinically relevant threshold 
was based on a pivotal randomised controlled trial with TNF 
blockade in patients with PsA (NCT01087788).15
Studies of other biologics targeting the IL-17 pathway 
have demonstrated efficacy in PsA.26 28 29 ACR20 response

subcutaneous) at week 24 versus 15% for placebo.26 A phase 3 
study of ixekizumab (anti-IL-17A mAb) demonstrated an ACR20 
response of 62% (80 mg subcutaneous Q2W) at week 24 versus 
30% for placebo.28 The ACR20 response rate for brodalumab 
(anti-IL-17RA mAb) was 39% at week 12 (280 mg subcuta-
neous) versus 18% for placebo.30 While the size and design of 
the current trial precludes any direct or indirect comparison 
between these published trials and SoC, the superiority of bime-
kizumab over the predefined clinically relevant threshold and the 
observed ACR20 responses (reaching 80% vs 17% for placebo at 
week 8) are encouraging. Alongside this, ACR50 (reaching 57% 
at week 12), ACR70 (reaching 37% at week 16), strong skin 
responses (PASI75 and PASI100 of 100% and 87%, respectively, 
at week 8) and rapid onset of action (some responses observed 
within 2 weeks of first infusion) concord to indicate robust ther-
apeutic efficacy of bimekizumab within the contextual limita-
tions of a PoC trial.
When evaluating these data, the size and duration of the PoC 
trial limits the interpretation of the safety dataset; furthermore, 
the small sample size warrants cautious interpretation of the 
observed therapeutic effect size. Because patients received only 
three doses of bimekizumab, further optimisation of the dosing 
regimen may impact the onset, level and durability of clinical 
responses in joint and skin. Of note, in the current trial, modi-
fications of background medication were allowed after week 
8, potentially explaining the increase in ACR responses seen 
in the placebo group between weeks 8 and 20. Imbalances in 
distribution of concomitant medications observed across treat-
ment groups may also have impacted our findings, and outcomes 
should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size.
In summary, the study supports our hypothesis that IL-17F 
plays a role in chronic tissue inflammation beyond that of 
IL-17A, and that dual neutralisation of IL-17F and IL-17A has a 
clinical impact on patients. The rapid, profound, and sustained 
joint and skin responses in the PoC trial with bimekizumab in 
active PsA support further clinical investigation of dual inhibi-
tion of IL-17A and IL-17F in immune-mediated inflammatory 
diseases.
