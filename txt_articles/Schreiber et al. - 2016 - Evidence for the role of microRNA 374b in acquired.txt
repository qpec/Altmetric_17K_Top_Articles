resistance in pancreatic cancer cells
R Schreiber1,2,3, R Mezencev1,3, LV Matyunina1 and JF McDonald1
Recent evidence has implicated microRNAs (miRNAs) as potentially significant players in the acquisition of cancer-drug resistance in
pancreatic and other cancers. To evaluate the potential contribution of miRNAs in acquired resistance to cisplatin in pancreatic
cancer, we compared levels of more than 2000 human miRNAs in a cisplatin-resistant cell line (BxPC3-R) derived from parental
(BxPC3) cells by step-wise exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug over more than 20 passages. The acquired drug
resistance was accompanied by significant changes in the expression of 57 miRNAs, of which 23 were downregulated and 34 were
upregulated. Employing a hidden Markov model (HMM) algorithm, we identified downregulation of miR-374b as likely being
directly involved in acquisition of the drug-resistant phenotype. Consistent with this prediction, ectopic overexpression of miR-374b
in the resistant BxPC3-R cells restored cisplatin sensitivity to levels approaching those displayed by the BxPC3 parental cells. The
results are consistent with a growing body of evidence implicating miRNAs in acquired cancer-drug resistance and with the
potential therapeutic value of these small regulatory RNAs in blocking and/or reversing the process.

INTRODUCTION
The ability of cancer cells to acquire resistance to chemotherapy is
one of the most pressing and challenging issues in contemporary
clinical oncology.1 The problem is especially acute for pancreatic
cancer where tumors are unresectable in over 80% of patients
making radio/chemotherapy the only viable alternatives.2 Recent
studies in pancreatic3–5 and other cancers6,7 have identified
microRNAs (miRNAs) as potentially important regulatory elements
underlying coordinated changes in gene expression associated
with acquired drug resistance. As such, miRNAs have been
proposed as a potential new class of agents for targeted treatment
of acquired drug resistance.8–10
We report here evidence for the contribution of miRNAs
in the acquisition of cisplatin resistance in a pancreatic cell line
(BxPC3-R) developed by step-wise increasing concentrations of
the drug over more than 20 passages.11 Using a hidden
Markov model (HMM) algorithm to find miRNAs most likely
contributing
to
gene
expression
changes
associated
with
cisplatin resistance in BxPC3-R cells, we identified downregulation
of miR-374b as putatively involved in acquisition of the drug-
resistant phenotype. Consistent with this prediction, ectopic
overexpression
of
miR-374b
in the
resistant
BxPC3-R
cells
restored cisplatin sensitivity to levels approaching those displayed
by the BxPC3 parental cells. Our results are consistent with the
growing body of evidence indicating that changes in miRNA levels
can have a significant role in the acquired resistance of cancer
cells to therapeutic drugs and that therapies designed to
modulate levels of these small regulatory RNAs may be of
significant therapeutic value in blocking and/or reversing acquired
drug resistance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
The cisplatin-resistant pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC3-R was developed
from parental human pancreatic adenocarcinoma BxPC3 cell line (ATCC
CRL-1687) by step-wise treatment as previously described.11 Cells were
cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Parental
cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) supple-
mented with 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum; Atlanta Biologicals, Law-
renceville,
GA)
and
1%
antibiotic-antimycotic
solution
(Mediatech).
Cisplatin-resistant cells were routinely maintained in the full RPMI medium
supplemented with 0.6 μM cisplatin. Before harvesting for experiments,
BxPC3-R cells were grown 1 × in cisplatin-free medium.
Growth inhibition assay
The growth inhibitory effects of cisplatin on the BxPC3 and BxPC3-R were
determined by measuring cell viability using the TOX-8 reagent (Resazurin
based in vitro toxicology assay kit, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Cells were
plated in 100 μl media on 96-well plates at a density of 3000 cells per well.
Subsequent to 24 h incubation, the cells were exposed to different
concentrations of cisplatin in total volume of 200 μl per well at 37 °C under
a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 72 h. Tox-8 (20 μl) was then added to each well;
incubation continued for an additional 4 h and fluorescence was read
using the Synergy 4 (Biotek, Winooski, VT) microplate reader (λex = 560 nm,
λem = 590 nm). Blank-corrected fluorescence signals for treated cells were
normalized to control wells (no drug treatment) and expressed as a
percentage of the control (% cell viability). The results from three
experiments were presented as mean ± s.e.m.
miRNA transfection
Transfection of the miR-374b mimetic and the negative control miRNA
(both from Applied Biosystems, ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY)
at final concentrations of 30 nM was carried out using the Lipofectamine

 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cells were harvested for subsequent analyses 48 h after the
transfection. All transfection experiments were carried out in triplicate.
RNA extraction, miRNA microarray analysis
Gene expression profiling of BxPC3 and BxPC3-R cells was performed using
GeneChip miRNA 3.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Cellular RNA
enriched for small RNAs (o200 nt) was isolated using the mirVana miRNA
isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (ThermoFisher
Scientific). The concentration and quality of miRNA were determined using
the Small RNA Assay in the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies,
Palo Alto, CA). In all, 400 ng of cellular RNA enriched for small RNAs was
labeled using the FlashTag Biotin HSR Labeling Kit, hybridized for 18 h at
48 °C (rotation 60 r.p.m.) on the GeneChip miRNA 3.0 Array, washed in the
Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 and scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip
Scanner 3000 7G (all from Affymetrix) as previously described.12 Microarray
experiments were performed in two replicates per each cell type. The data
were analyzed with Expression Console software Build 1.2.1.20 (Affymetrix)
using the default analysis setting for RMA+DAGB workflow and submitted
to the Gene Expression Omnibus repository (GEO, available under the
series accession number GSE79506).
Computational analysis
MiRNAs differentially expressed between parental BxPC3 and cisplatin-
resistant BxPC3-R cells were identified by differential expression analysis of
the normalized miRNA 3.0 Array data using the absolute fold change (FC)
⩾ 2 and ANOVA P-value o0.05 as a threshold.
The 561 annotated genes previously reported as upregulated in BxPC3-R
cells relative to BxPC3 cells11 (data are publicly available under Gene
Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/; series accession
number GSE73978) were uploaded to miRvestigator (http://mirvestigator.
systemsbiology.net)13 and analyzed for overrepresented sequence motifs
to identify miRNAs most likely involved in the regulation of these genes
through their complementary seeds. miRvestigator was employed using
the following parameters: Weeder Parameters: Motif Sizes: 8 bp; Weeder
Model: Default; Seed Models: 6mer, 7mer, 8mer; Wobble Base-Pairing: No.
The top 10 miRNAs complementary to the overrepresented sequence
motif were identified and compared with the list of miRNAs found to be
differentially expressed between BxPC3 and BxPC3-R cells by miRNA
microarray profiling.
RESULTS
Significant changes in the expression of miRNAs are associated
with the acquisition of cisplatin resistance in BxPC3-R cells
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the expression profiles of
miRNAs was carried out on two biological replicates each of the
parental cisplatin-sensitive BxPC3 cells and derived resistant
BxPC3-R cells (Figure 1). Using a threshold of ⩾ 2-FC, 57 miRNAs
were identified as being significantly differentially expressed
(Po0.05) between the BxPC3 and BxPC3-R cells. Of these, 23
miRNAs were downregulated and 34 were upregulated (Table 1).
Computational analysis of gene expression changes between
BcPC3 and BcPC3-R cells implicates miR-374b in the acquisition of
cisplatin resistance
We previously developed a pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC3-R with
~ 15-fold increase in resistance to cisplatin by exposing the well-
characterized pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line BxPC3 to step-
wise increasing concentrations of the drug over more than 20
passages.11 Comparative gene expression analysis determined that
1565 genes were differentially expressed between the cisplatin-
resistant BxPC3-R cells relative to the pre-selected BxPC3 cells
(Gene Expression Omnibus series accession number GSE73978).11
Of these, 561 genes were significantly upregulated in the resistant
BxPC3-R cells and many of these upregulated genes were found to
have been previously associated with acquired drug resistance.11
In the current study, the 561 upregulated genes were uploaded
to miRvestigator13 to detect overrepresented sequence motifs

 within the genes' untranslated leader regions and to putatively
identify those miRNAs most likely associated with their regulation.
The miRvestigator algorithm identified a significantly overrepre-
sented consensus sequence present among 31% of the upregu-
lated gene sequences (5’-UAUUGUAA-3’) (Figure 2).
The 10 miRNAs identified by miRvestigator as containing
sequences most significantly complementary to this consensus
sequence are presented in Table 2. Of these, miR-374b was among
the miRNAs most significantly downregulated in the BxPC3-R-
resistant cells (FC = − 3.16, Table 1). Moreover, miR-374b was
found to have highly significant overall complementarity with the
consensus
sequence
(Po7.3e − 04).
Indeed,
the
consensus
sequence is an exact compliment to the miR-374b 7-mer seed
sequence (Table 2). Combined, these findings strongly implicated
the downregulation of miR-374b in BxPC3-R cells with acquired
cisplatin resistance.
Ectopic overexpression of miR-374b in cisplatin-resistant BxPC3-R
cells decreases drug resistance to levels approaching those in pre-
selected BxPC3 cells
To experimentally test the hypothesis that downregulation of
miR-374b has contributed to acquired cisplatin resistance in
BxPC3-R cells, we ectopically overexpressed an miR-374b mimetic
in BxPC3-R cells and subsequently tested the sensitivity of the cells
to increasing concentrations of cisplatin relative to controls.
The results presented in Figure 3 demonstrate that sensitivity
to cisplatin was significantly increased in BxPC3-R cells in which
miR-374b was ectopically overexpressed. The sensitivity of the
miR-374b-transfected cells to cisplatin was not significantly
different from the parental BxPC3 cells at the highest level of
drug tested (4.5 µM) (P = 0.25). In contrast, cells transfected with
the mock miRNA (negative control) maintained a level of cisplatin
resistance statistically indistinguishable from the BxPC3-R-resistant
cells. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that
downregulation of miR-374b is a significant factor in the acquired
cisplatin resistance of BxPC3-R cells.
DISCUSSION
Recent evidence has implicated miRNAs as potentially significant
players
in
the
acquisition
of
cancer-drug
resistance
in
pancreatic3–5 and many other cancer types.6,7 In an effort to
further evaluate the potential contribution of miRNAs in acquired
drug resistance in pancreatic cancer, we compared levels of over
2000 human miRNAs in a well-characterized pancreatic cell line,
BxPC3, and a cisplatin-resistant cell line (BxPC3-R) derived from
BxPC3 cells by step-wise exposure to increasing concentrations of
the drug over more than 20 passages.11 We found that the
acquired resistance of BxPC3 cells to cisplatin was accompanied
by significant (Po0.01) changes in the expression of 57 miRNAs,
of which 23 were downregulated and 34 were upregulated. It is
possible that many, if not all of these differentially expressed
miRNAs, may have contributed either directly or indirectly to the
acquisition of drug resistance in BxPC3-R cells. Indeed, several of
the miRNAs differentially expressed between BxPC3-R and BxPC3
cells have been previously implicated in acquired drug resistance
in pancreatic (for example, miR-7,5 miR-21 (refs. 14,15) and
Table 1.

miR-122 (ref. 18) and miR-326 (ref. 19)).
Because experimental validation of the functional significance
of each of the 57 differentially expressed miRNAs associated
with
acquired
cisplatin
resistance
in
BxPC3-R
cells
would
be a monumental task beyond the scope of the present
study, we sought a computational approach that could narrow
focus to those most likely implicated in the regulation of the
majority of genes differentially expressed between BxPC3 and
BxPC3-R cells. miRvestigator is a HMM algorithm that system-
atically computes a similarity P-value for each unique miRNA seed
sequence from the miRNA database to an overrepresented
sequence motif identified within the 3′-UTR of the query
genes.13 In our case, the query genes applied to the algorithm
were the 561 genes significantly upregulated in the BxPC3-R-
resistant cells.
The miRvestigator algorithm identified the consensus sequence
5′-UAUUGUAA-3′ as being present within the untranslated leader
regions of 31% of upregulated genes. This motif was identified as
pairing significantly with the seed regions of a number of miRNAs
including miR-374b, one of the most significantly downregulated
miRNAs in BxPC3-R-resistant cells (Table 1).
The computational prediction that downregulation of miR-374b
likely contributed to the acquisition of resistance to cisplatin in
BxPC3-R cells was experimentally tested by transfection of
miR-374b into BxPC3-R cells and subsequently measuring cisplatin
sensitivity
of
these
cells
relative
to
controls.
The
results
demonstrated that miR-374b transfection significantly reduced
drug resistance in BxPC3-R cells to levels approaching those of the
parental BxPC3 cells.

 Mir-374b is predicted to directly target 47000 genes (http://
www.microrna.org/) and downregulation of miR-374b, like most
miRNAs, is predicted to result in upregulation of directly targeted
genes.20,21 Of the 561 genes upregulated in BxPC3-R cells, 201 are
predicted to be directly targeted by miR-374b (Supplementary
Table S1). Among these are genes previously implicated in
cisplatin resistance including ATP7A (ATPase, Cu++ Transporting,
Alpha Polypeptide)22 and CLU (Clusterin).23 This is not to say that
these are the only genes likely involved in miR-374b-mediated
acquisition of drug resistance nor that miR-374b is the only miRNA
contributing to the process. Rather, emerging evidence indicates
that drug resistance, like cancer onset and progression, is a
system-wide process and not necessarily attributable to changes
in the expression of one or a few genes.24 Just as there are
multiple molecular pathways involved in acquired drug resistance,
there are likely to be multiple pathways by which drug sensitivity
can be restored. The growing body
of evidence for the
involvement
of
miRNAs
in
acquired
drug
resistance6–8,10,21
supports the systems view and identifies miRNAs as regulatory
elements of potentially significant therapeutic value.
