Abstract
Sexual assault on college campuses is a public health issue. However varying research
methodologies (e.g., different sexual assault definitions, measures, assessment time-
frames) and low response rates hamper efforts to define the scope of the problem. To illumi-
nate the complexity of campus sexual assault, we collected survey data from a large
population-based random sample of undergraduate students from Columbia University and
Barnard College in New York City, using evidence based methods to maximize response
rates and sample representativeness, and behaviorally specific measures of sexual assault
to accurately capture victimization rates. This paper focuses on student experiences of dif-
ferent types of sexual assault victimization, as well as sociodemographic, social, and risk
environment correlates. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and logistic regression were
used to estimate prevalences and test associations. Since college entry, 22% of students
reported experiencing at least one incident of sexual assault (defined as sexualized touch-
ing, attempted penetration [oral, anal, vaginal, other], or completed penetration). Women
and gender nonconforming students reported the highest rates (28% and 38%, respec-
tively), although men also reported sexual assault (12.5%). Across types of assault and
gender groups, incapacitation due to alcohol and drug use and/or other factors was the
perpetration method reported most frequently (> 50%); physical force (particularly for

 completed penetration in women) and verbal coercion were also commonly reported. Fac-
tors associated with increased risk for sexual assault included non-heterosexual identity, dif-
ficulty paying for basic necessities, fraternity/sorority membership, participation in more
casual sexual encounters (“hook ups”) vs. exclusive/monogamous or no sexual relation-
ships, binge drinking, and experiencing sexual assault before college. High rates of re-vic-
timization during college were reported across gender groups. Our study is consistent with
prevalence findings previously reported. Variation in types of assault and methods of perpe-
tration experienced across gender groups highlight the need to develop prevention strate-
gies tailored to specific risk groups.
Introduction
Recent estimates of sexual assault victimization among college students in the United States
(US) are as high as 20–25% [1–3], prompting universities to enhance or develop policies and
programs to prevent sexual assault. However, a 2016 review [4] highlights the variation in sex-
ual assault prevalence estimates (1.8% to 34%) which likely can be attributed to methodological
differences across studies, including varying sexual assault definitions, sampling methods,
assessment timeframes, and target populations [4]. Such differences can hamper efforts to
understand the scope of the problem. Moreover, while accurate estimates of prevalence are
crucial for calling attention to the population-health burden of sexual assault, knowing more
about risk factors is critical for determining resource allocation and developing effective pro-
grams and policies for prevention.
Reasons for the variation in prevalence estimates include different definitions of sexual
assault and assessment methods. Under the rubric of sexual assault, researchers have investi-
gated experiences ranging from sexual harassment at school or work, to unwanted touching,
including fondling on the street or dance floor, to either unwanted/non-consensual attempts
at oral, anal or vaginal sexual intercourse (attempted penetrative sex), or completed penetrative
sex [3,5–7]. Some studies have focused on a composite variable of multiple forms of unwanted/
non-consensual sexual contact [8,9] while others focus on a single behavior, such as completed
rape [10]. Some studies focus on acts perpetrated by a single method (e.g. incapacitation due
to alcohol and drug use or other factors) [11], while others include a range of methods (e.g.,
physical force, verbal coercion, and incapacitation) [12–15]. In general, studies that ask about
a wide range of acts and use behaviorally specific questions about types of sexual assault and
methods of perpetration have yielded more accurate estimates [16]. Behavioral specificity
avoids the pitfall of participants using their own sexual assault definitions and does not require
the respondent to identify as a victim or survivor, which may lead to underreporting [10,17–
19].
Although an increasing number of studies have used behaviorally specific methods and
examined prevalence and predictors of sexual assault [20,21], they typically have used con-
venience samples. Only a few published studies have used population-based surveys and
achieved response rates sufficient to mitigate some of the concerns of sample response bias [4].
US federal agencies have urged universities to implement standardized “campus climate sur-
veys” to assess the prevalence and reporting of sexual violence [22]. Although these surveys
have emphasized behavioral specificity, many have yielded low response rates (e.g., 25%) [23],
particularly among men [24], creating potential for response bias in the obtained data. Popula-
tion-based probability samples with behavioral specificity, good response rates, sufficiently

 large samples to examine risk for specific subgroups (e.g., sexual minority students), and
detailed information on personal, social, or contextual risk factors (e.g., alcohol use) [22,23]
are needed to more accurately define prevalence and inform evidence-based sexual assault pre-
vention programs.
Existing evidence suggests that most sexual assault incidents are perpetrated against women
[25]; however, few studies have examined college men as survivors of assault [26–28]. Further-
more, our understanding of how sexual orientation and gender identity relate to risk for sexual
assault is limited, despite indications that lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB), and gender non-con-
forming (GNC) students are at high risk [29–31]. It is unclear if these groups are at higher risk
for all types of sexual assault or if prevention programming should be tailored to address par-
ticular types of assault within these groups. Also, although women appear to be at highest risk
for assault during freshman year [32,33], the dearth of studies with men or GNC students have
limited conclusions about whether freshman year is also a risky period for them.
Additional factors associated with experiencing sexual assault in college students include
being a racial/ethnic minority student (although there are mixed findings on race/ethnicity)
[34,35], low financial status, and prior history of sexual assault [3,33,36]. Other risk factors
include variables related to student social life, including being a freshman [24], participating in
fraternities and sororities [19,37,38], binge drinking [1,39] and participating in “hook-up” cul-
ture [40–42]. Whether sexual assault is happening in the context of more casual, typically non-
committal sexual relationships (“hook-ups”) [40] vs. steady intimate or monogamous relation-
ships has important implications for prevention efforts.
To fill some of these knowledge gaps, we examined survey data collected from a large popu-
lation-based random sample of undergraduate women, men, and GNC students at Columbia
University (CU) and Barnard College (BC). The aims of this paper are to:
1. Estimate the prevalence of types of sexual assault incidents involving a) sexualized touching,
b) attempted penetrative (oral, anal or vaginal) sex, and c) completed penetrative sex since
starting at CU/BC;
2. Describe the methods of perpetration (e.g., incapacitation, physical force, verbal coercion)
used; and
3. Examine associations between key sociodemographic, social and romantic/sexual relation-
ship factors and different types of sexual assault victimization, and how these associations
differ by gender.
Materials and methods
This study used data from a population-representative survey that formed one component of
the Sexual Health Initiative to Foster Transformation (SHIFT) study. SHIFT used mixed meth-
ods to examine risk and protective factors affecting sexual health and sexual violence among
college undergraduates from two inter-related institutions, CU’s undergraduate schools (co-
educational) and BC (women only), both located in New York City. SHIFT featured ethno-
graphic research, the survey, and a daily diary study. Additionally, SHIFT focused on internal
policy-translation work to inform institutionally-appropriate, multi-level approaches to
prevention.
Participants
Survey participants were selected via stratified random sampling from the March 2016 popula-
tion of 9,616 CU/BC undergraduate students ages 18–29 years. We utilized evidence-based

 methods to enhance response rates and sample representativeness [22,43]. Using administra-
tive records of enrolled students, 2,500 students (2,000 from CU and 500 from BC) were
invited via email to participate in a web-based survey. Of these 2,500 students, 1,671 (67%)
consented to participate (see Procedures). Among those who consented to participate, 80.5%
were from CU and 19.5% were from BC (see Table 1 below for demographic data on the CU/
BC student population, the random sample of students contacted, the survey responders, and
the current analytic sample).
Procedures
SHIFT employed multiple procedures to assure protection of students involved in our study;
these procedures also improve scientific rigor. The study was approved by the Columbia Uni-
versity Medical Center Institutional Review Board and we obtained a federal Certificate of
Confidentiality to legally protect our data from subpoena. SHIFT also obtained a University

aCramer’s V is a measure of effect size for the difference between the demographic distributions in the responders (n = 1671) vs the full sample (n = 2500).
Cohen (1988) recommends that when Cramer’s V <0.10 this indicates small effects suggesting no practical difference between samples.
b Senior responders included (n = 9) students who self-reported their year in school as fifth or more (undergrad only).

 waiver from reporting on individual sexual assaults, as reporting would obviate student privacy
and willingness to participate. Students were offered information about referrals to health and
mental health resources during the consent process and at the end of the survey, and such
information was available from SHIFT via other communication channels. Finally, in report-
ing data we suppressed data from tables where there were less than 3 subjects in any cell to
avoid the possibility of deductive identification of an individual student [44].
SHIFT used principles of Community Based Participatory Research regarding ongoing dia-
logue with University stakeholders on study development and implementation to maximize
the quality of data and impact of research findings [45]. This included weekly meetings
between SHIFT investigators and an Undergraduate Advisory Board, consisting of 13–18 stu-
dents, reflecting the undergraduate student body’s diversity in terms of gender, race/ethnicity,
sexual orientation, year in school, and activities (e.g., fraternity/sorority membership). It also
included regular meetings with an Institutional Advisory Board comprised of senior adminis-
trators, including CU’s Office of General Counsel, facilities, sexual violence response, student
conduct, officials involved in gender-based misconduct concerns, athletics, a chaplain, mental
health and counseling, residential life, student health, and student life.
Following both the Undergraduate Advisory Board’s recommendations and Dillman’s Tai-
lored Design Method for maximizing survey response rates [43], multiple methods were used
to advertise and recruit students. These included: a) email messages, both to generate interest
and remind students who had been selected to participate, crafted to resonate with diverse stu-
dent motives for participation (e.g., interest in sexual assault, compensation, community spirit,
and achieving higher response rates than surveys at peer institutions), b) posting flyers, c)
holding “study breaks,” in which students were given snacks and drinks, and d) tabling in pub-
lic areas on campus.
Participants used a unique link to access the survey either at our on-campus research office
where computers and snacks were provided (16% of participants) or at a location of their
choosing (84% of participants) from March-May, 2016. Before beginning the survey, partici-
pants were asked to provide informed consent on an electronic form describing the study, con-
fidentiality, compensation for time and effort, data handling procedures, and the right to
refuse to answer any question. Students who completed the survey received $40 in compensa-
tion, given in cash to those who completed the survey in our on-campus research office or as
an electronic gift card if completed elsewhere. Students were also entered into a lottery to win
additional $200 electronic gift cards. This compensation was established based on feedback
from student and institutional advisors and reviewed by our Institutional Review Board. It was
judged to be sufficient to promote participation, and help ensure that we captured a represen-
tative sample, including students who might otherwise have to choose between paid opportu-
nities and participating in our survey, but not great enough to feel coercive for low resource
students. This amount of compensation is in line with other similar studies [46]. On average,
the survey took 35–40 minutes to complete.
Measures
The SHIFT survey included behaviorally-specific measures of different types of sexual assault,
perpetrated by different methods, as well as measures of key sociodemographic, social and sex-
ual relationship factors, and risk environment characteristics. The majority of instruments had
been validated previously with college- age students. The survey was administered in English
using Qualtrics (www.qualtrics.com), providing a secure platform for online data collection.
Sexual assault.
Sexual assault was assessed with a slightly modified version of the revised
Sexual Experiences Survey [16], the most widely used measure of sexual assault victimization

 with very good psychometric properties including internal consistency and validity previously
published [17,47]. The Sexual Experiences Survey employs behaviorally specific questions to
improve accuracy [18]. The scale includes questions on type of assault, including sexualized
touching without penetration (touching, kissing, fondling, grabbing in a sexual way), attempted
but not completed penetrative assault (oral, vaginal, anal or other type of penetration; herein
referred to as attempted penetrative assault) and completed penetrative assault (herein referred
to as penetrative assault). We used most of the Sexual Experiences Survey as is. However, with
strong urging from our Undergraduate Advisory Board, we made a modification, combining
the questions about different types of penetration (oral, vaginal, etc.) rather than asking about
each kind separately. In the Sexual Experiences Survey, for each type of assault there are six
methods of perpetration. Two of the types reflect verbal coercion: 1) “Telling lies, threatening to
end the relationship, threatening to spread rumors about me, making promises I knew were
untrue, or continually verbally pressuring me after I said I didn’t want to” (herein referred to as
“lying/threats”), and 2) “Showing displeasure, criticizing my sexuality or attractiveness, getting
angry but not using physical force, after I said I didn’t want to” (herein referred to as “criti-
cism”). The remaining types included use of physical force, threats of physical harm, or incapac-
itation (“Taking advantage when I couldn’t say no because I was either too drunk, passed out,
asleep or otherwise incapacitated”), and other. For each incident of sexual assault, participants
could endorse multiple methods of perpetration. Participants were also asked to report whether
these experiences occurred: a) during the current academic year (this was a second modification
to the Sexual Experiences Survey) and/or b) since enrollment but prior to the current academic
year. For this paper, data for the two time periods were combined, reflecting the entire period
since starting CU/BC. See Fig 1 for a replica of the questionnaire.
Demographics.
Demographics included gender identity (male, female, trans-male/trans-
female, gender queer/gender-non-conforming, other) [48], year in school (e.g., freshman,
sophomore, junior, senior), age, US born (yes/no), lived in US less than five years (yes/no;
proxy for recent international student status), transfer student (yes/no), low socioeconomic
status (receipt of Pell grant-yes/no [need-based grants for low-income students, with eligibility
dependent on family income]); how often participant has trouble paying for basic necessities
(never, rarely, sometimes, often, all of the time), and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic-Asian, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic/Latin-x, other [other included: American
Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, More than one Race/Ethnicity,
Other]). Gender was categorized as follows: female, male and GNC (students who responded
to gender identity question as anything other than male or female).
Fraternity/Sorority. Fraternity/sorority membership (ever participated) was assessed
with one question from a school activities checklist (yes/no). We report on Greek life participa-
tion here to engage with the substantial attention this has received as a risk factor.
Problematic drinking.
Problematic drinking during the last year was assessed with the
Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) [49], a widely used, well-validated stan-
dardized 10-item screening tool developed by the World Health Organization. Psychometrics
have been established in numerous studies [50–52]. The AUDIT assesses alcohol consumption,
drinking behaviors, and alcohol-related problems. Participants rate each question on a 5-point
scale from 0 (never) to 4 (daily or almost daily) for possible scores ranging from 0 to 40. The
range of AUDIT scores represents varying levels of risk: 0–7 (low), 8–15 (risky or hazardous),
16–19 (high-risk or harmful), and 20 or greater (high-risk). We also examined one AUDIT item
on binge drinking, defined as having 6+ drinks on one occasion at least monthly [49].
Sexual orientation.
Sexual orientation was assessed with one question with the following
response options (students could select all that applied): asexual, pansexual, bisexual, queer,
heterosexual and homosexual, as well as other [53,54]. Students were categorized into four
Sexual assault incidents among college undergraduates

 mutually exclusive groups for analyses: heterosexual, bisexual, homosexual, and other which
included asexual, pansexual, queer, or another identity not listed. Non-heterosexual students
who indicated more than one orientation were assigned hierarchically to bisexual, homosex-
ual, then other.
Romantic/sexual relationships.
Romantic/sexual relationships since enrollment at CU/
BC were assessed with one question. Response choices included: none, steady or serious rela-
tionship, exclusive or monogamous relationship, hook-up-one time, and ongoing hook-up or
friends with benefits. Students defined “hookup” for themselves. Students could check all that
applied. This variable was trichotomized: at least one hook-up, only steady or exclusive/
monogamous relationships, and no romantic/sexual relationships.
Pre-college sexual assault.
Students also were asked one yes/no question on whether they
had experienced any unwanted sexual contact prior to enrolling at CU/BC.
Data analysis
To assess the representativeness of the sample, the distribution of demographic variables based
on administrative records from CU and BC for the total University undergraduate population
were compared to the random sample of students contacted, the survey responders, and the
current analytic sample, which consists of students that responded to the questions about

 sexual assault. Demographics for survey responders are based on self-report from the survey.
Cramer’s V effect size was used to assess the magnitude of the differences in demographic dis-
tributions between the CU/BC population and respondent sample where smaller values (i.e.
Cramer’s V <0.10) indicate strong similarity [55].
Analyses were performed on each type of sexual assault as well as a combined “Any type of
sexual assault” variable: yes/no experienced sexualized touching, attempted penetrative assault,
and/or penetrative assault since CU/BC. Prevalence of each type of sexual assault was calcu-
lated by gender and year in school, with chi-square tests of difference used to compare preva-
lence between genders across each year in school versus freshman year. The total number of
incidents of assault and the mean, median and standard deviation for number of incidents of
assault per person reporting at least one assault were summarized. Among individuals who
experienced any type of sexual assault, the proportions that experienced a particular method of
perpetration (e.g. incapacitation, physical force) were calculated by type of sexual assault. Chi-
square tests compared proportions between males and females for each perpetration method.
The associations of each key correlate with the odds of experiencing any sexual assault were
calculated and tested using logistic regression stratified by male/female gender. In addition, a
multinomial regression with hierarchical categories (no assault, sexualized touching only,
attempted penetrative assault [not completed], and penetrative assault [completed]) as the out-
come was performed to examine if associations differed by type of sexual assault. To adjust for
the fact that the sample comes from a finite population (i.e. CU/BC N = 5,765 women;
N = 3,851 men), a standard finite population correction was implemented for standard error
estimation using SAS Proc Surveylogistic. Given the low sample size of GNC students, they
were excluded from some analyses. All analyses were conducted using SAS (v. 9.4).
Results
Descriptive statistics
Table 1 presents demographic data on the full University, the randomly selected sample, the
respondents and the analytic sample for this paper. Among students who consented to the sur-
vey (n = 1,671), 46 stopped the survey before the sexual assault questions and 33 refused to
answer them resulting in an analytic sample of n = 1,592 (95% completion among responders).
Demographic characteristics (i.e. gender [male, female], age, race/ethnicity, year in school,
international status, and economic need [Pell grant status]) of the respondent sample were
very similar (Cramer’s V effect size differences all <0.10 [55]) to the full CU/BC population
(Table 1) indicating that the responder and final analytic samples were representative of the
student body population.
The analytic sample included 58% women, 40% men, and 2% GNC students (4 students
refused to identify their gender) and was distributed evenly by year in school with most (92%)
between18-23 years of age. Self-reported race/ethnicity was 43% white non-Hispanic, 23%
Asian, 15% Hispanic/Latino, and 8% black non-Hispanic; 13% were transfer students, and the
majority of the sample was born in the US (76%). Twenty-three percent of participants
received Pell grants and 51% of students acknowledged at least sometimes having difficulty
paying for basic necessities.
The majority of women (79%) and men (85%) identified as heterosexual. In terms of
romantic/sexual relationships since starting CU/BC, 30.0% of women and 21.6% of men
reported no relationships, 21.0% of women and 22.6% of men reported only steady/exclusive
relationships with no hookups, and 49.0% of women and 55.7% of men reported at least one
hook-up. Finally, 25.5% of women, 9.4% of men, and 47.0% of GNC students reported pre-col-
lege sexual assault.

 Aim 1: Prevalence of sexual assault victimization at CU/BC
Overall rates by gender and school year. Since starting CU/BC, 22.0% (350/1,592) of stu-
dents reported experiencing at least one incident of any sexual assault across the three types
(sexualized touching, attempted penetrative assault, and penetrative assault). Table 2 presents
data on types of assault by gender and year in school. Women were over twice as likely as men
to report any sexual assault (28.1% vs 12.5%). There was evidence of cumulative risk for
experiencing sexual assault among women over four years of college, so that by junior and
senior year, respectively, 29.7% and 36.4% of women reported experiencing any sexual assault,
compared to 21.0% of freshman women who had only one year of possible exposure (p < .05).
However, one-fifth (21.0%) of women who took the survey as freshman had experienced
unwanted sexual contact, compared to 36.4% over 3+ years (seniors), suggesting that as others
have found, the risk of assault is highest in freshman year.
Among men, one in eight indicated that they had been sexually assaulted since starting CU.
Similar to women, the risk for sexual assault among men accumulated over the four years of
college, with 15.6% of seniors vs 9.9% of freshman reporting a sexual assault since entering
CU, although this difference was not statistically significant.
Although the numbers were small, GNC students reported the highest prevalence of sexual
assault since starting CU/BC (38.5%; 10/26). Numbers were too small (n<3) to present strati-
fied by year in school (see Table 2).
Types of sexual assault by gender (Table 2). The most prevalent form of sexual assault
was sexualized touching; rates for women (23.6%) and GNC students (38.5%) were signifi-
cantly higher than rates for men (11.0%; p < .05). Prevalence of attempted penetrative assault
and penetrative assault were about half that of sexualized touching. Compared to men, women
were three times as likely to report attempted penetrative assault (11.1% vs 3.8%) and over
twice as likely to experience penetrative assault (13.6% vs 5.2%). Among GNC students, the
majority reporting sexualized touching, with rates of the other two types too small to report.

Note: Some respondents reported multiple unique incidents corresponding to multiple types of unwanted sexual contact; therefore, total number of
respondents who experienced each of the three types of unwanted sexual contact do not sum to total number of respondents who experienced "Any type" of
unwanted sexual contact.

 Experiencing multiple sexual assaults (Fig 2; S1 Table). Students could report multiple
types of sexual assault incidents (i.e. sexualized touching, attempted penetrative, and penetra-
tive assault) as well as multiple incidents experienced of each type. Overall, students reported a
total of 1,007 incidents of sexual assault experienced since starting CU/BC. For the 350 stu-
dents who indicated any sexual assault, the median number of incidents experienced was 3.
Among the 350 students reporting any sexual assault, Fig 2 presents different combinations
of sexual assault experienced by students since CU/BC. Most prevalent, 38.0% reported
experiencing only sexualized touching; 19.0% reported both sexualized touching and penetra-
tive assault incidents; 17.0% experienced all three types of assault; and 12.0% sexualized touch-
ing and attempted penetrative assault.
Aim 2: Methods of perpetration (lying/threats, criticism, incapacitation,
physical force, threats of harm, and other) by gender (Table 3)
Across types of assault, incapacitation was the method of perpetration reported most fre-
quently (> 50%) in both men and women. For both women and men, approximately two-

 thirds of all penetrative assaults and about half of sexualized touching and attempted penetra-
tive assaults involved incapacitation.
Physical force was reported significantly more frequently by women than men (34.6% vs
12.7%) for any sexual assault. More specifically, compared to men, women were three times
more likely to experience sexualized touching via physical force (32.1% vs. 10.0%), and six
times more likely to experience penetrative assaults via physical force (33.3% vs 6.1%).
Lastly, a sizeable number of respondents reported verbal coercion (ranging from 21.0% to
over 40.0% depending on type of assault). Criticism was cited by women at rates similar to
physical force for both sexualized touching and penetrative assaults. Among men, both verbal
coercion methods were cited most frequently after incapacitation for all three types of assault.
For GNC students, we examined rates of each perpetration method for only the composite
variable any sexual assault (due to small numbers in any specific type of assault). Among those
who experienced an assault, incapacitation was the most frequently mentioned method
(50.0%), followed by criticism (40.0%).
Aim 3: Identify factors associated with sexual assault experiences
We examined the association between sexual assault (both any sexual assault [Table 4] and
each type of sexual assault [Table 5]) and key demographic, sexual history and social activity
factors. Results are stratified by gender (women/men).
Race/Ethnicity.
For both women and men, the prevalence of any sexual assault was simi-
lar for all race/ethnicity groups compared to non-Hispanic White students with one exception.
Asian students (women and men) were less likely to experience any sexual assault than non-
Hispanic White students. For women only, differences emerged by type of assault. Asian
women compared to non-Hispanic White women were less likely to experience penetrative
assault (OR = 0.35, CI: 0.19–0.62), but not attempted penetrative assault (OR = 0.56, CI: 0.25–

 1.26), nor sexualized touching only (OR = 1.00, CI: 0.59–1.69). Black women were found to
have increased odds of touching only incidents compared to non-Hispanic White women
(OR = 1.99, CI: 1.05–3.74). There were no other significant racial or ethnic differences.
Economic precarity.
Women who often or always had difficulty paying for basic necessi-
ties had increased odds of any sexual assault; for men the trend was similar but it did not reach
statistical significance. Considering penetrative assault specifically, both men and women
who often or always had difficulty paying for basic necessities had increased risk (women
OR = 2.24, CI: 1.23–4.09; men OR = 3.07, CI: 1.04–9.07) compared to those who never had
difficulty.
Transfer student.
Women transfer students were less likely to experience any sexual
assault than non-transfer students. Closer inspection of type of assault revealed that this pro-
tective effect was seen for sexualized touching only (OR = 0.34, CI: 0.15–0.80), but not for pen-
etrative (OR = 0.60, CI: 0.34–1.08), nor attempted penetrative (OR = 1.03, CI: 0.48–2.21)
assault. There were no significant differences between men who were transfer students and
those who were not.
Sexual orientation.
For women, those who identified as bisexual and those who identified
as some other sexual identity besides heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual (includes people
endorsing exclusively one or a combination of: Asexual, Pansexual, Queer, or a sexual orienta-
tion not listed), were more likely to experience any sexual assault than heterosexual students.
For penetrative assault specifically, this increased risk was only present for individuals with
some other sexual identity (OR = 2.11, CI: 1.20–3.73). For men, those who identified as homo-
sexual were more likely to experience any sexual assault than heterosexual male students. For
penetrative assault specifically, those who identified as homosexual, bisexual, or some other sex-
ual identity all had substantially increased risk compared to those with a heterosexual identity
(OR = 4.74, CI: 2.10–10.71; OR = 3.39, CI: 1.03–11.16; OR = 4.74, CI:1.10–20.48, respectively).
Information about the gender of the perpetrator for different gender and sexual orientation
groups was available for a subset of incidents (336/997). Among these events, 98.4% (3/184) of
the heterosexual women indicated the perpetrator was a man, while 97.1% (33/34) of the

 bisexual women, 75% (3/4) of the homosexual women, and 88.9% (24/27) of the other sexual
identity women indicated it was a man. For men who were assaulted, 84.9% (45/53) of the het-
erosexual men reported the perpetrator was a woman, while 0 of the homosexual men said the
perpetrator was a woman. Numbers for bisexual men and other sexual identity men were too
small to report separately, but combined showed that 5/8 (63.0%) of bisexual and other sexual
identity men said the perpetrator was a woman. Of the GNC students reporting on a most-sig-
nificant event, 77.8% (7/9) reported that they were assaulted by a male perpetrator (the num-
bers are too small to further examine by sexual orientation).
Lived in US less than 5 years.
There was no association found between living in the US
for less than 5 years and any sexual assault, nor any specific type of sexual assault.
Relationship status.
Among both women and men, students who had at least one hook-
up were more likely to have experienced any sexual assault than students who were in only
steady/exclusive relationships since starting college. Among women who had engaged in at
least one hook-up, this increased risk held for each type of sexual assault (penetrative:
OR = 5.03, CI = 2.91–8.68, attempted penetrative: OR = 4.43, CI = 1.83–10.8, sexualized touch-
ing only: OR = 3.26, CI = 1.74–6.09), while among men the increased risk was found for sexu-
alized touching only (OR = 13.33, CI = 2.09–85.08), but could not be estimated (due to small
numbers) for completed penetrative assault. Women who did not have any romantic or sexual
relationship since CU/BC were found to be less likely to experience penetrative assault than
women who had a steady/exclusive relationships only (OR = 0.05, CI: 0.01–0.31).
Fraternity/Sorority membership.
Although a relative minority of students participated
in fraternities (24.1%) or sororities (18.2%), for both men and women, those who participated
were more likely to experience any sexual assault than those who did not. Examination of type
of assault revealed that the effect is driven primarily by sexualized touching only which is sig-
nificant in both women (OR = 1.63, CI: 1.00–2.67) and men (OR = 2.40, CI: 1.25–4.63) and
not significantly increased for penetrative nor attempted penetrative assault.
Risky or hazardous drinking.
For both men and women, individuals who met criteria on
the AUDIT for risky or hazardous drinking were more likely to experience any sexual assault
than those who did not. When examining each type of assault separately, for men this increased
risk was only significant for penetrative assault (OR = 4.07, CI: 2.01–8.21). For women, the
increased risk of assault held for each type of assault—penetrative (OR = 6.04, CI: 4.10–8.90),
attempted (OR = 3.38, CI: 1.84–6.19) and touching (OR = 2.33, CI: 1.42–3.81). We also looked
at one AUDIT item specifically on binge drinking (6 or more drinks on a single occasion). Indi-
viduals who reported binge drinking at least monthly were more likely to experience any sexual
assault than those who did not. When examining each type of assault separately, for men this
increased risk was only significant for penetrative assault (OR = 2.15, CI: 1.12–4.15). For
women, this increased risk was significant for penetrative assault (OR = 3.12, CI: 2.09–4.65),
attempted assault (OR = 2.28, CI: 1.20–4.33), and touching (OR = 2.42, CI:1.50–3.91).
Pre-college assault (Table 5). Among both women and men, those who experienced
pre-college assault were more likely to experience any sexual assault while at CU/BC. The
increased risk held for penetrative assault in both women (OR = 3.01, CI: 2.07–4.37) and men
(OR = 2.44, CI: 1.03–5.76). In women, the increased risk also held for attempted penetrative,
but not touching only, whereas in men, the increased risk held for touching only, but not
attempted penetrative sex.
Discussion
The SHIFT survey, with a population-representative sample, good response rate and behavior-
ally-specific questions, found that 22.0% of students reported a sexual assault since starting

 college, which confirms previous studies of 1 in 4 or 1 in 5 prevalence estimates with national
samples and a range of types of schools [23,24]. However, a key finding is that focusing only
on the “1 in 4/ 1 in 5” rate of any sexual assault obscures much of the nuance concerning types
of sexual assault as well as the differential group risk, as prevalence rates were unevenly distrib-
uted across gender and several other social and demographic factors.
Similar to other studies [4,24], women had much higher rates of experiencing any type of
sexual assault compared to men (28.0% vs 12.0%). Moreover, our data suggest a cumulative
risk for sexual assault experiences over four years of college with over one in three women
experiencing an assault by senior year. However, our data also suggest that freshman year, par-
ticularly for women, is when the greatest percentage experience an assault. This supports other
work on freshman year as a particularly critical time for prevention efforts, otherwise known
as the “red zone” effect for women [32].
Importantly, our study confirms that GNC students are at heightened risk for sexual assault
[23]. They had the highest proportion of sexual assaults, with 38.0% reporting at least one inci-
dent, the majority of which involved unwanted/non-consensual sexualized touching. These
data should be interpreted very cautiously given the small number of GNC students. However,
increasingly studies suggest that transgender and other GNC students have sexual health needs
that may not be targeted by traditional programming [57]; thus, a better understanding of
pathways to vulnerability among these students is of high importance.
Similarly, students who identified as a sexual orientation other than heterosexual were at
increased risk for experiencing any sexual assault, with bisexual women or women who identi-
fied as “other” and men who identified as any non-heterosexual category at increased risk.
Similar to GNC students, understanding the specific social and sexual health needs of LGB stu-
dents, particularly as it relates to reducing sexual assault risk is critical to prevention efforts
[58]. Factors such as stigma and discrimination, lack of communication, substance use, as well
as a potential lack of tailored prevention programs may play a role. To our knowledge, there
are no evidence-based college sexual assault prevention programs targeting LGB and GNC stu-
dents. Our data suggest that the LGB and GNC experiences are not uniform; more research
should be done within each of these groups to understand the mechanisms behind their poten-
tially unique risk factors.
Our data also suggest that the 20–25% rate of any sexual assault obscures variation in assault
experiences. Sexualized touching accounted for the highest percentage of acts across gender
groups, with over one-third of participants reporting only sexualized touching incidents. Rates
of attempted and completed penetrative sexual assault were about half the rate of sexualized
touching. This finding does not minimize the importance of addressing unacceptably high
rates of attempted penetrative and penetrative assault (14%-15%), but it does suggest the
importance of specificity in prevention efforts. For GNC students, for example, the risk of
assault was primarily for sexualized touching with very few reporting attempted penetrative
assault or penetrative assault during their time at CU/BC. These elevated rates of unwanted
sexual touching may be a combination of GNC students’ focus on their gendered sexual
boundaries–and thus potentially greater awareness of when advances are unwanted–at a devel-
opmental moment when they are building non-traditional gender identities, as well as these
students’ social vulnerability. Further investigation is warranted.
Moreover, there was variation in methods of perpetration reported by survivors of sexual
assault. Incapacitation was the most common method reported across all gender groups for
each type of assault, and female and male students who reported risky or hazardous drinking
were at increased risk for experiencing any sexual assault, particularly penetrative assault.
Across campuses in the US, hazardous drinking is a national problem with substantive nega-
tive health outcomes, risk for sexual assault being one of them [2,39,59]. Our data underline

 the potential of programs and policies to reduce substance use and limit its harms as one ele-
ment of comprehensive sexual assault prevention; we found few evidence-based interventions
that address both binge drinking and sexual assault prevention. Of course, any work address-
ing substance use as a driver of vulnerability must do so in a way that does not replicate vic-
tim-blaming.
However, similar to other studies with broad foci, incapacitation was not the only method
of perpetration reported. For women, physical force, particularly for penetrative sex, was the
second most frequently endorsed method. Verbal coercion, including criticism, lying and
threats to end the relationship or spread rumors, was also employed at rates similar to physical
force for women, and was the second most frequently endorsed category for men and GNC
students. Prevention programs, such as the bystander interventions which are the focus of
efforts on many campuses [60], often focus on incapacitation or physical force. These interven-
tions tend to highlight situations where survivors (typically women) are vulnerable because
they are under the influence of substances. In SHIFT, verbal coercion is also shown to be a
powerful driver of assault; however, it typically does not receive as much attention as rape,
which is legally defined as penetration due to physical force or incapacitation. If a survivor is
verbally coerced into providing affirmative consent, the incident could be considered within
consent guidelines of “yes means yes” but it may have been unwanted by the survivor [61,62].
Assertiveness interventions and those that focus on verbal consent practices may be useful for
addressing this form of assault.
We also found high rates of re-victimization. As others have found, pre-college sexual
assault was a key predictor for experiencing assault at CU/BC [33,36]. However, we also found
high rates of repeat victimization since starting at CU/BC with a median of 3 incidents per per-
son reporting any sexual assault since starting CU/BC, and the highest risk of repeat victimiza-
tion in women and GNC students. These data underline the importance of prevention efforts
that include care for survivors to reduce the enhanced vulnerability that has been shown in
other populations of assault survivors [36]. Future studies should also seek to disaggregate the
relationship between type of victimization (sexualized touching, attempted penetrative assault,
penetrative assault) and repeat victimization.
This study also identified a number of variables associated with sexual assault, some similar
to previous studies and others different. As noted, gender was a key correlate. While preven-
tion efforts should respond to the population-level burden by focusing on the needs of women
and GNC students, it is important to note that men were also at risk of sexual assault. In our
study, nearly 1 in 8 men reported a sexual assault experience, a rate also found in the Online
College Social Life survey [56], but higher than other studies [63,64]. Few programs target
men, and issues around masculinity and gender roles may make it difficult for men to consider
or report what has happened to them as sexual assault. Importantly, this study found that men
who were members of fraternities were at higher risk for experiencing assault (specifically
unwanted/nonconsensual sexualized touching) than those who were not members. This is
consistent with previous findings, including the Online College Social Life survey [56], but is
of particular note because research has identified men in fraternities as more likely to be perpe-
trators [64], but few, if any, studies have looked at fraternity members’ vulnerability to sexual
assault. Our data suggest a need for further examination of the cultural and organizational
dimensions of Greek life that produce this heightened risk of being assaulted for both men and
women. However, it is important to note that we did not examine a range of other social and
extracurricular groups which may have produced risk as well and thus a more full examination
of student undergraduate life is needed.
One other key factor associated with assault was participation in “hook ups”. Both male and
female students who reported hooking up were more likely to report experiencing sexual

 assault, compared to students who only had exclusive or monogamous relationships and those
who had no sexual relationships. The role of hooking up on college campuses has received
much attention in the popular press and in a number of books [65,66], but little has been writ-
ten about its connection to sexual assault, although several recent studies are in line with ours
about its role as a risk factor for experiencing sexual assault on college campuses [40,41]. Mul-
tiple mechanisms may be at work: students who participate in hookups may be having sex
with more people, and thus face greater risk of assault due to greater exposure to sex with a
potential perpetrator, but students who participate in hookups may also face increased vulner-
ability because many hookups involve “drunk” sex, or because hookups by definition involve
sexual interactions between people who are not in a long-term intimate relationship, and thus
whose bodies and social cues maybe unfamiliar to each other. Alternatively some aspects of
hook-ups may be more or less risky than others and therefore continued study of different
dimensions of these more casual relationships that can refer to a wide-range of behaviors is
necessary.
Several demographic characteristics were not for the most part associated with sexual
assault. We did not find racial or ethnic differences in sexual assault risk with primarily one
exception, Asian male and female students were at less risk overall compared to white students.
We also did not find transfer students to be at greater risk; female transfer students were actu-
ally at lower risk, potentially due to less exposure time, particularly during freshman year.
International student status as indicated by having been in the US<5 years was also not associ-
ated with increased risk. However, this study highlights the role of economic factors that have
received limited attention in the literature. Little is known about how economic insecurity
may drive vulnerability, but issues of power, privilege, and control of alcohol and space all
require further examination.
There are several limitations to this study. Participants came from only two private schools
that are interconnected in one city, and thus findings may not generalize to the rest of the US.
There is a continued need for more national studies with different types of colleges and univer-
sities in urban and rural environments with more varied economic backgrounds in order to
fully understand institutional and contextual differences. Although we had a response rate that
was higher than many prior studies and our rates of sexual assault are consistent with prior
studies [4], we cannot assess the extent to which selection bias may have occurred and there-
fore, our rates could be an underrepresentation or overrepresentation depending on who
chose to participate. Although this concern is somewhat mitigated by findings that basic
demographic data between respondents and the total population of students at two colleges
suggest no significant differences, there may be some bias in factors we did not consider. Our
present analysis has focused only on bivariate associations between risk factors and assault.
While this analysis provides a valuable description of which groups are at elevated risk or not,
future work will consider how combinations of risk factors at different levels may interact to
increase risk. Critically, the analysis presented here reflects a focus on those who experience
being assaulted, but in other work we look at the characteristics of perpetrators, both from
those who reported perpetrating and from a subset of incidents that survey respondents
described in depth, which provided more information about the perpetrator. A greater
understanding of the characteristics and contexts of perpetration is without question vital for
effective prevention. Finally, our data are cross sectional. Longitudinal studies with a compre-
hensive range of predictors are critical for identifying pathways of causality and targets for
interventions.
Despite these limitations, this study confirms the unacceptably high rates of sexual assault
and suggests diversity in experiences and methods of perpetration. A key conclusion is that
a”one size fits all” approach that characterizes the extant literature on evidence-based

 prevention programs [67] may need to be altered to more effectively prevent sexual assault in
college. Clearly different groups had differential risk for assault and may require much more
targeted prevention efforts. Bystander interventions have shown promise in addressing risk in
social situations, including fraternity parties and other settings with high alcohol use [68,69].
However, bystander interventions may not be sufficient for incidents occurring in non-party
contexts where verbal coercion methods or physical force may be used without others around.
Creating effective and sustainable changes to campus culture requires engaging with a
broad range of institutional stakeholders. SHIFT investigators are in the process of sharing
selected findings with both student and institutional advisory boards, and an intensive collabo-
rative process allows us to explore the implications of our results for a broad range of policies
and programs, including both elements commonly considered as sexual assault prevention
(consent education, bystander trainings), more general topics related to sexual orientation and
verbal discussions of sex, and aspects of the institutional context across diverse domains
including alcohol policy, mental health services, residential life policies, orientation planning,
and the allocation of space across campus.
Overall, our findings argue for the potential of a systems-based [70] public health
approach–one that recognizes the multiple interrelated factors that produce adverse outcomes,
and perhaps particularly emphasizes gender and economic disparities and resulting power
dynamics, widespread use of alcohol, attitudes about sexuality, and conversations about sex–to
make inroads on an issue that stubbornly persists.
