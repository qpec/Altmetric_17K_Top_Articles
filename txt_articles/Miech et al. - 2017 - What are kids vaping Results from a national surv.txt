 What are kids vaping? Results from a national
survey of US adolescents
Richard Miech, Megan E Patrick, Patrick M O’Malley, Lloyd D Johnston
ABSTRACT
Objective To examine what substances US youth vape.
Methods Data come from Monitoring the Future,
an annual, nationally representative survey of USA
12th-grade, 10th-grade and 8th-grade students.
Respondents reported what substance they vaped the
last time they used a vaporiser such as an e-cigarette.
Results Among students who had ever used a
vaporiser, 65–66% last used ‘just flavouring’ in 12th, in
10th and in 8th grade, more than all other responses
combined. In all three grades, the percentage using ‘just
flavouring’ was above 57% for males, females, African-
Americans, Hispanics, Whites, and students both with
and without a parent with a college degree. Nicotine
use came in a distant second, at about 20% in 12th
and 10th grade and 13% in 8th grade. Taking into
account youth who vaped nicotine at last use increases
national estimates of tobacco/nicotine prevalence in the
past 30 days by 24–38% above and beyond cigarette
smoking, which is substantial but far less than estimates
that assume all vaporiser users inhale nicotine.
Conclusions These results challenge the common
assumption that all vaporiser users inhale nicotine. They
(a) call into question the designation of vaporisers and
e-cigarettes as ENDS (‘Electronic Nicotine Delivery
System’), (b) suggest that the recent rise in adolescent
vaporiser use does not necessarily indicate a nicotine
epidemic, and (c) indicate that vaporiser users can be
candidates for primary prevention programmes. Finally,
the results suggest the importance of developing
different rationales for the regulation of vaporiser devices
as compared to the regulation of substances marketed
for vaporiser use.
INTRODUCTION
Adolescents’ use of vaporisers such as e-cigarettes
has increased rapidly in recent years in the USA. In
2015, 30-day prevalence of e-cigarettes was 16%
among 12th graders, 14% among 10th graders and
10% among 8th graders.1 This is a rapid growth
from a 30-day prevalence of near 1% among sec-
ondary school students in 2011.2 The use has grown
to such an extent that among adolescents 30-day
prevalence of e-cigarette use in 2015 was higher
than prevalence of any tobacco product, including
traditional tobacco cigarettes.1 3 A common assump-
tion among researchers and policymakers is that
adolescents
are
vaping
nicotine,
although
this
assumption has yet to be examined closely.
This study presents some of the first information
on the substances that US youth are vaping. W
e
present results from the 2015 Monitoring the
Future study (MTF), which asked students whether
they vaped nicotine, marijuana, just flavouring,
some other substance, or whether they did not
know what they vaped. MTF is a large, nationally
representative
study
of
US
8th-,
10th-,
and
12th-grade students in the 48 contiguous states.4
The term ‘vaporiser’ refers to battery-powered
devices with a heating element and is a term that
includes
the
specific
vaporiser
device
of
e-cigarettes. Vaporisers produce an aerosol, small
particulates suspended in air and vapour, the gas
phase of chemicals, that users inhale. The liquid
that is used in vaporisers comes in hundreds of fla-
vours, which are available both with and without
nicotine per the user’s choice.
The extent to which youth vape nicotine is not cur-
rently known. On the one hand, a common assump-
tion in the field is that nicotine is the predominant
substance that youth vape. This assumption is impli-
cit in the name ‘ENDS’, the term often used for
vaporisers in academic and government reports. This
acronym stands for ‘Electronic Nicotine Delivery
Systems’, a name that implies all users are inhaling
nicotine. The term ‘e-cigarette’ that is widely used in
the research and popular literatures also implies nico-
tine use. Furthermore, this assumption of nicotine
vaping underlies the practice of categorising all
vaporiser users as tobacco/nicotine users, a practice
used in US national estimates of tobacco use.5
On the other hand, it is possible that a large per-
centage of youth who use vaporisers do not vape
nicotine. For example, 70% of Canadian high school
students who had ever used an e-cigarette had never
vaped nicotine,6 a finding replicated among the
general adult Canadian population.7 It is important
to note that the generalisability of this finding to
countries other than Canada is not certain; Canada’s
regulatory context is unique because e-cigarettes with
nicotine are technically not legal,7 which may lower
the prevalence of nicotine vaping.
Identifying the percentage of US adolescents who
use vaporisers to inhale nicotine contributes to the
literature in at least two ways. First, this information
is important for the interpretation of the recent,
exponential increase in e-cigarette use among US
adolescents. Whether or not the increase should be
interpreted as an epidemic of adolescent nicotine
use is contingent on the percentage of youth who
are using vaporisers to inhale nicotine. Second, the
percentage who vape nicotine has important impli-
cations for regulation. A percentage substantially
<100% underscores the need to consider the differ-
ence between regulating vaporiser devices as com-
pared to regulating the substances that are vaped.

Tob Control: first published as 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2016-053014 on 25 August 2016. Downloaded from 
 administered in classrooms to survey nationally representative
samples of students in the 48 contiguous US states.4 The survey
consists of three separate, nationally representative samples of
12th-grade, 10th-grade and 8th-grade students and this analysis
uses data from the year 2015, the first year that the survey asked
respondents what substances they vaped. Data collection was
approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review
Board. Students were informed that their answers in the aggre-
gate would be used to produce national estimates, that their
answers would be confidential, that participation was com-
pletely voluntary and that they should leave blank any question
they did not wish to answer.
In 2015, a total of 44 892 students located in 382 public and
private schools participated, with student response rates of
89%, 87% and 83% in 8th, 10th and 12th grades, respectively.
The great majority of non-response is due to student absence.
Schools are selected using a multistage, stratified research
design.8 The first stage is the geographic area and consists of
164 primary areas. The second stage is schools, and response
rates of originally selected schools were 41% in 8th grade, 52%
in 10th grade and 48% in 12th grade. For schools that do not
participate, replacements are chosen to be as similar as possible
to the original school being replaced in terms of region, demo-
graphics and population density; 93% of sample slots were
filled with an original or replacement. Given that most variation
in substance use is within schools and not across them—only
about 4–5% of the variation in 30-day marijuana use is between
schools9—any
bias
introduced
by
replacement
schools
is
expected to be small.
Questions about vaping were asked of a randomly selected
one-third of the samples in 12th grade (n=4591), 10th grade
(n=5379) and 8th grade (n=5013). In 2015, respondents were
asked whether they ever used a vaporiser with the question
“Electronic vaporizers make a mist that is inhaled and have the
feel of cigarette smoking. Examples include e-cigarettes and
e-pens. Have you ever used an electronic vaporizer such as an e-
cigarette?” Respondents who had ever used a vaporiser were
asked “The LAST TIME you used an electronic vaporizer such
as an e-cigarette, what was in the mist you inhaled?” to which
respondents chose one reply from the choices ‘Nicotine,’
‘Marijuana or hash oil,’ ‘Just flavouring,’ ‘Other,’ and ‘Don’t
know.’ Respondents who had ever used a vaporiser were also
asked the frequency of use in the past 30 days, with responses
of 0, 1–5 days and >5 days. Respondents were also asked
whether they had smoked a regular cigarette in the past 30 days.
The survey included self-reported sociodemographic informa-
tion on gender, parental education and race/ethnicity, the latter
of which identified the categories of non-Hispanic White,
non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic respondents. For 12th-grade
students, the survey also included questions on e-cigarettes, in
particular. Students were asked “During the LAST 30 DAYS (if
any), have you used electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes)?”
The analyses are based on all data available for univariate and
bivariate distributions (tables 1–3) and use listwise deletion for
comparison of different ways to estimate tobacco/nicotine preva-
lence (table 4). All analyses use weights and were performed
with Stata MP V
.12.1 software (StataCorp. Stata Statistical
Software: Release 12.0. College Station, T
exas, USA: StataCorp
LP; 2011). W
e use the STATA ‘survey’ algorithms to take into
account clustering within strata and schools for the calculation
of SEs.
Analysis of missing data indicated that it had little influence
on the results of this study. Completion rates for the question
on lifetime vaporiser use were 90%, 94% and 91% in 12th,
10th and 8th grade, respectively. To consider the potential influ-
ence of missing data on the distribution of substance vaped, we
ran an imputed data analysis, which generated 20 datasets that
assigned values to missing data on the basis of responses to
other survey questions, including cigarette smoking. Of this
study’s 70 estimates for prevalence of different substances vaped
(reported in table 2), none of the values from the imputed ana-
lysis differed by more than 1.07 percentage-points from the ana-
lysis based on the reported data only. Of the respondents who
answered the question on lifetime vaporiser use, missing data
values for demographic characteristics were 6% or less in all
grades with the exception of parents’ education as reported by
8th-grade students, which was missing 13%. Missing values on
demographic variable did not significantly predict the type of
substance vaped in any grade. W
e report results from analyses
using non-imputed results for ease of interpretation.
RESULTS
T
able 1 presents the sociodemographic distribution of the ana-
lysis samples. About half of respondents are female and slightly
more than half have at least one parent who has a college
degree. In terms of racial/ethnic composition, the majority of
8th graders are members of minority racial/ethnic groups, while
the 10th-grade and 12th-grade cohorts are majority White.
T
able 2 presents the substances students vaped at last use,
asked only of those who had ever vaped. ‘Just flavouring’ is by
far the most commonly vaped substance. In all grades, for life-
time and past 30-day vaping subgroups, ‘just flavouring’ was
vaped more than all other substances combined. Of the students
who had ever used a vaporiser in their life (34% of 12th
graders, 32% of 10th graders and 21% of 8th graders), 65–
66% in each grade reported vaping ‘just flavouring’ at last use.
Of the students who had used a vaporiser in the past month
(16% of 12th graders, 14% of 10th graders and 8% of 8th
graders), 59–63% of students in each grade reported vaping
‘just flavouring’ at last use.
Vaping of nicotine came in a distant second place. Among
respondents who had ever vaped, about 20% of 12th and 10th
grade students and 13% of 8th-grade students reported vaping
nicotine at last use.
Vaping marijuana at last use was reported by about 6% of
respondents who had ever vaped in their life in all three grades.
Levels of marijuana vaping were higher among 10th-grade and
8th-grade students who reported vaping in the past 30 days,
with a prevalence of 9% and 11%, respectively, but slightly
lower among 12th-grade students, 5%.

 Respondents who vaped six or more times as compared to
1–5 times in the past 30 days showed significant differences in
substances vaped in 12th and 10th grades. Specifically, in both
grades, the respondents with higher frequency of vaping were
significantly more likely to vape nicotine and significantly less
likely to vape flavouring.
Table 3 presents the demographic distribution of substances
last vaped among respondents who had ever used a vaporiser by
12th grade. Nicotine was more likely to be vaped by males, by
Whites and by respondents who had at least one parent with a
college degree. Flavouring was more likely to be vaped by
females and by Hispanics (compared to Whites).
In 10th and 8th grades, few comparisons across sociodemo-
graphic groups were significantly different and no strong pattern
emerged (see online supplementary table S2). In 10th grade,
only one out of 35 comparisons significantly differed. More sig-
nificant differences are present among 8th-grade students,
although these differences do not follow a clear pattern.

 youth. One current approach is to consider all vaporiser users
to be tobacco and nicotine users, regardless of what substance
they are vaping. This approach doubles estimates of tobacco
prevalence in 12th grade as compared to estimates based solely
on cigarette smoking. In 10th and 8th grades, this approach
almost triples the estimate of tobacco/nicotine prevalence. An
alternative approach is to consider vaporisers to be tobacco/
nicotine users only if they reported nicotine as the last substance
they vaped in the past 30 days, an approach that leads to much
smaller
increases
in
prevalence
estimates;
specifically,
this
approach
increases
tobacco/nicotine
prevalence
above
and
beyond cigarette use by 24% in 12th grade (1.24=12.44/
10.06), by 38% in 10th grade and by 23% in 8th grade.
Online supplementary tables S1 and S3 show that study
results are similar when substituting e-cigarette use for vaporiser
use. Online supplementary table S1 shows that the distribution
of substances vaped among e-cigarette users is nearly identical
to the results with vaporisers (compare with table 2). Online
supplementary table S3 indicates that questions on ‘e-cigarettes’
produce similar tobacco/nicotine prevalence estimates as ques-
tions on ‘vaporisers’ (compare with table 4).
DISCUSSION
This study presents some of the first information on the sub-
stances that US adolescents vape. Nicotine is assumed by many
to be the predominant substance that youth vape, although, to
the best of our knowledge, this assumption is not based on the
scientific data.
‘Just flavouring’—and not nicotine—was by far the most com-
monly vaped substance in all grades. Among students who had
ever used a vaporiser in their life, the portion who used ‘just fla-
vouring’ the last time they vaped was greater than all other sub-
stances combined. This response was markedly consistent across
grades and was reported by 65–66% of students in 12th, in
10th and in 8th grades. In all grades, the percentage reporting
that they had last vaped ‘just flavouring’ was above 57% for
males, females, Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, and students with
and without a parent who had a college degree. The percentage
who vaped ‘just flavouring’ at last use was also high among stu-
dents who used a vaporiser in the past 30 days, at a prevalence
of 59% or higher in all three grades.
Nicotine came in a distant second place among youth who
had used a vaporiser. About 20% of 12th and 10th grade stu-
dents and 13% of 8th-grade students vaped nicotine at last use.
Across the demographic groups of gender, race/ethnicity and
parental education, nicotine use in vaporisers never exceeded
26% in any of the three grades. In 12th grade, its use was
highest among Whites, males and students with at least one
parent who had a college degree. This unusual pattern of
greater use among more advantaged demographic groups is
similar to the early diffusion of other substances such as
cigarettes and cocaine, which had been concentrated in advan-
taged groups in past decades but are now concentrated in disad-
vantaged groups after the substances developed a reputation as
dangerous.10–12
Among the group of students who had vaped in the past
30 days, the portion who last vaped nicotine was 31% in 12th,
27% in 10th and 16% in 8th grade. Among students who had
vaped 6+ times in the past 30 days, these percentages were 25–
50% higher as compared to those who had vaped 1–5 times.
This result indicates that the importance of the cut-off between
vaping 1–5 as compared to 6+ times in the past 30 days—a
threshold highlighted by previous research13—extends to sub-
stances vaped. In no case did the prevalence of nicotine vaping
reach 50% or greater.
W
e note that the percentage who vaped nicotine was higher
in the older age groups; longitudinal data are required to deter-
mine whether this represents younger vapers progressing to
nicotine and/or an influx of new vapers at older ages.
Levels of marijuana vaping were about 6% in each of the
three grades among students who had ever used a vaporiser.
These levels did not significantly differ by sociodemographic
groups, with the exception in 8th grade of higher prevalence of
marijuana vaping among Hispanics as compared to Whites.
Among students who had used a vaporiser in the last 30 days,
vaping of marijuana was highest in 8th grade.
Some youth did not know what substance they last vaped.
This percentage was 14% in 8th grade and declined at older age
groups, reaching 6% in 12th grade. The lowest percentage was
2% among heavy vapers, who presumably are more intentional
in the substances that they vape.
Four major implications follow from the study’s main finding
that most youth who use vaporisers do not use nicotine. First,
these results suggest the need to reconsider the term ‘ENDS’ to
denote vaporisers and e-cigarettes, at least among US adoles-
cents. The term stands for ‘electronic nicotine delivery system’,
which seems inaccurate for the description of a device that the
majority of youth do not use to vape nicotine.
A second implication is the need to reconsider the impact of
vaporisers on the estimated national prevalence of nicotine use
among US youths. The current assumption that vaporiser use is
synonymous with nicotine use leads to a doubling of past 30-day
tobacco/nicotine prevalence in 12th grade and a near tripling in
10th and 8th grades (see tables 4 and S3) as compared to estimates
based on cigarette use alone. However, the results from this study
indicate that many vaporiser users do not vape nicotine. If vapor-
iser users are considered nicotine users only if they last vaped nico-
tine in the last 30 days, then national estimates of nicotine
prevalence increase by a much smaller percentage of 23–38%
across the three grades. These results indicate that while taking into
account vaporiser use does indeed increase tobacco/nicotine preva-
lence, the impact of vaporisers is likely not as large as might appear
by their recent, dramatic increase in use among adolescents.
A third implication is that vaporiser use may serve as an indi-
cator for primary prevention programmes aimed at nicotine use.
Because many US youth who use vaporisers do not vape nico-
tine, they are candidates for primary interventions, which are
particularly strategic to combat nicotine use because they take
place before the need to address nicotine’s addictive properties.
Furthermore, recent evidence that vaporiser use is a risk factor
for future cigarette use14–18 suggests that vaporiser use can serve
as an important marker for youth who are at elevated risk for
future nicotine use.
A fourth implication is that a different rationale for the regu-
lation of vaporiser devices will be required as compared to the

 regulation of vaporiser contents. The finding that most US
youth do not vape nicotine makes it difficult to ban sales of
vaporisers to youth on the grounds that all of them intrinsically
deliver harmful substances to children in all circumstances, a
primary rationale to ban the sale of cigarettes to youth. In the
absence of an established body of evidence that links vaping any
substance to impaired health, bans on sales of vaporisers to
youth may need to draw on other rationales, such as the poten-
tial of vaporisers to desensitise youth to the dangers of tobacco
smoking, and/or the argument that children are at high risk to
unintentionally vape substances that will harm them.
In contrast, the rationale that children should be protected
from harmful substances can be readily extended to the regula-
tion of specific substances marketed for vaporisers. The fact that
a substantial portion of youth are vaping nicotine, even if not
the majority, underscores the importance of regulations aimed at
clearly labelling the contents of these commercial materials and
preventing children from access to the ones known to be
harmful. Recently proposed ‘deeming’ rules by the US Food and
Drug Administration19 provide a cornerstone for regulations
along these lines.
It is important to note three limitations of this study. First, it
is possible that youth may self-report that they are not using
nicotine when, in fact, they are vaping nicotine but do not
realise it. This may increase somewhat the estimates of nicotine
use among the least experienced users who may not recognise
the physiological symptoms associated with nicotine use. The
most accurate knowledge of substances vaped is expected to be
among the most experienced users, which in this study are the
12th-grade students who vaped six or more times in the last
30 days and presumably are more intentional in the substances
they vape. The study’s main conclusion that most youth who
use vaporisers do not vape nicotine is bolstered by the fact that
less than half of this experienced group reported vaping nico-
tine, a finding difficult to ascribe to inaccurate self-reports.
A second limitation is that the sample of frequent vapers
who vaped six or more times in the past 30 days is not large
enough to support in depth analysis. This small group is of
considerable importance for theory and for policy. On the one
hand, it may represent a new class of substance user who uses
vaporisers exclusively, a class supported by preliminary evi-
dence in a recent analysis of e-cigarette users in 12th grade.20
On
the
other
hand,
it
may
represent
a
standard,
well-
documented class of polysubstance users who have simply
extended their use of drugs to a new device.21–23 Furthermore,
the heightened use of nicotine in this group warrants future
analysis to examine whether their level of nicotine inhaled
reaches that of their peers who use cigarettes. A third limita-
tion is that the study lacks information on youth who have
vaped multiple, different substances within the past 30 days.
Some non-smoking youth who last vaped flavouring in the past
30 days may have also vaped nicotine earlier in the 30-day
period, information not currently available in the data because
the survey asks about only substance last vaped. Future MTF
surveys will collect more detailed information on substances
vaped, which will support an alternative measure of nicotine
prevalence that takes into account this possibility of youth
vaping multiple, different substances These measures will likely
increase estimates of the percentage of youth who vape sub-
stances other than flavouring.
In conclusion, the majority of US youth who use vaporisers
and e-cigarettes do not vape nicotine. This finding challenges
many common assumptions and practices, and points to the
need for vaporiser-specific research to assess and ultimately
regulate the public health threat of vaporisers. T
aking into
account this finding now, while the field is young, will help
ensure that future vaporiser science and regulations are built on
a solid footing.
What this paper adds
▸ The use of vaporisers such as e-cigarettes by adolescents
has grown exponentially in recent years, but little is known
about what substances they are vaping.
▸ Using a nationally representative sample of adolescents we
find that most of them (about 60%) report that they vaped
‘just flavouring’ at last use. Less than a quarter reported
vaping nicotine at last use.
▸ These results challenge the common assumption that most
youth use vaporisers to vape nicotine.
