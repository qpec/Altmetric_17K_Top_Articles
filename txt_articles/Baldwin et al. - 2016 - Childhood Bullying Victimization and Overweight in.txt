Abstract
Objective—To test whether bullied children have an elevated risk of being overweight in young 
adulthood, and whether this association is: (1) consistent with a dose-response relationship - 
namely its strength increases with the chronicity of victimization; (2) consistent across different 
measures of overweight; (3) specific to bullying and not explained by co-occurring maltreatment; 
(4) independent of key potential confounders; and (5) consistent with the temporal sequence of 
bullying preceding overweight.
Method—A representative birth cohort of 2,232 children was followed to age 18 years as part of 
the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study. Childhood bullying victimization was 
reported by mothers and children during primary school and early secondary school. At age 18, we 
assessed a categorical measure of overweight, body mass index (BMI), and waist-hip ratio. 
Indicators of overweight were also collected at ages 10 and 12. Co-twin body-mass and birth 
weight were used to index genetic and fetal liability to overweight, respectively.

 Results—Bullied children were more likely to be overweight than non-bullied children at age 18, 
and this association was: (1) strongest in chronically bullied children (OR=1.69, 95% CI=1.21–
2.35); (2) consistent across measures of overweight (BMI: b=1.12, 95% CI=0.37–1.87; waist-hip 
ratio: b=1.76, 95% CI=0.84–2.69); (3) specific to bullying and not explained by co-occurring 
maltreatment; (4) independent of socio-economic status, food insecurity, child mental health/
cognition, and pubertal development; and (5) not present at the time of bullying victimization, and 
independent of childhood weight and genetic and fetal liability.
Conclusion—Childhood bullying victimization predicts overweight in young adulthood.

INTRODUCTION
Overweight affects 69% of adults in the United States (1), increases risk of cardiovascular 
disease, Type-2 diabetes, and cancer (2), and is associated with social discrimination (3). 
There is little evidence that readily available interventions targeting overweight, such as diet 
and behavioral changes, have long-term effectiveness (4). Therefore, it is important to 
identify potentially modifiable risk factors as targets for prevention.
Experiences during sensitive childhood periods may have long-lasting effects on body mass 
(5). Experimental evidence from non-human primates shows that chronic psychosocial stress 
in early life can lead to greater body mass in later life (6, 7). Similarly, observational studies 
of humans suggest that early life stress can predispose to excess body mass. For example, 
individuals with a history of childhood maltreatment have an elevated risk of obesity in 
adulthood (8) and show faster gains in body mass index (BMI) over their lifetime (9) 
compared to non-maltreated individuals. However, maltreatment by adults is only one of 
several prevalent, chronic, and severe childhood stressors. To test the broader hypothesis that 
early life stress predisposes to excess body mass in humans, it is important to test whether 
findings related to maltreatment generalize to other such stressors.
Childhood bullying victimization is another severe stressor increasingly targeted by public 
health campaigns (10, 11). Emerging evidence suggests that bullying victimization is 
associated with overweight in later life (12–14). Despite these initial findings, several 
outstanding questions remain. First, it is important to establish whether the association 
between bullying victimization and overweight is consistent with a dose-response 
relationship, with greater chronicity of exposure predicting greater risk of becoming 
overweight. Yet, it is unclear if overweight risk is a function of the chronicity of bullying 
victimization. Second, it is important to test whether the association between bullying 
victimization and overweight is consistent across different measures of overweight. 
However, it is unclear if the association generalizes from global measures like BMI to 
measures of central adiposity, such as waist-hip ratio, which predict disease risks over and 
above BMI (15). Third, it is important to establish whether the association with overweight 
risk is specific to bullying victimization. Bullying victimization often co-occurs with 
childhood maltreatment (16), and it is unclear whether maltreatment accounts for the

 association. Fourth, it is important to test whether the association between bullying 
victimization and overweight is independent of confounding linked to psychosocial risk or 
child characteristics. For example, bullying victimization occurs more frequently in the 
context of socioeconomic disadvantage and food insecurity (16, 17), which are risk factors 
for overweight (18). Additionally, children with externalizing problems, internalizing 
problems, and low IQ are more liable to bullying victimization (16), as well as later 
overweight (14). Furthermore, early pubertal development is associated with bullying 
victimization (19) and predicts overweight (20). However, it is unclear if co-occurring 
psychosocial risks or child characteristics confound the association. Finally, because 
overweight children may be more likely to be bullied (13, 21), it is important to test whether 
bullying victimization precedes the development of overweight. However, it is unclear if the 
association between childhood bullying victimization and later overweight is independent of 
continuity in body mass or of genetic and fetal liability (22, 23). We sought to test these key 
questions in a birth cohort of 2,232 twins followed to age 18.
Method
Study sample
Participants were members of the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, 
which tracks the development of a birth cohort of 2,232 British children. The sample was 
drawn from a larger birth register of twins born in England and Wales in 1994–95 (24). Full 
details about the sample are reported elsewhere (25). Briefly, the E-Risk sample was 
constructed in 1999–2000, when 1,116 families (93% of those eligible) with same-sex 5-
year-old twins participated in home-visit assessments. This sample comprised 55% 
monozygotic (MZ) and 45% dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs; sex was evenly distributed within 
zygosity (49% male). Seven percent of the study members self-identified as Black, Asian, or 
mixed-race. Families were recruited to represent the U.K. population of families with 
newborns in the 1990s, on the basis of residential location throughout England and Wales 
and mother’s age. Teenaged mothers with twins were over-selected to replace high-risk 
families who were selectively lost to the register through non-response. Older mothers 
having twins via assisted reproduction were under-selected to avoid an excess of well-
educated older mothers.
At follow up, the study sample represents the full range of socioeconomic conditions in the 
U.K., as reflected in the families’ distribution on a neighborhood-level socioeconomic index 
(ACORN [A Classification of Residential Neighbourhoods], developed by CACI Inc. for 
commercial use in Great Britain)(26). ACORN uses census and other survey-based 
geodemographic discriminators to classify enumeration districts (~150 households) into 
socioeconomic groups ranging from “wealthy achievers” (Category 1) with high incomes, 
large single-family houses, and access to many amenities, to “hard pressed” neighborhoods 
(Category 5) dominated by government-subsidized housing estates, low incomes, high 
unemployment, and single parents. ACORN classifications were geocoded to match the 
location of each E-Risk study family’s home (27). E-Risk families’ ACORN distribution 
closely matches that of households nation-wide: 25.6% of E-Risk families live in “wealthy 
achiever” neighborhoods compared to 25.3% nationwide; 5.3% vs. 11.6% live in “urban

 prosperity” neighborhoods; 29.6% vs. 26.9% live in “comfortably off” neighborhoods; 
13.4% vs. 13.9% live in “moderate means” neighborhoods; and 26.1% vs. 20.7% live in 
“hard-pressed” neighborhoods. E-Risk underrepresents “urban prosperity” neighborhoods 
because such households are likely to be childless.
Follow-up home visits were conducted when children were aged 7 (98% participation), 10 
(96% participation), 12 (96% participation), and, in 2012–2014, at 18 years (93% 
participation). There were 2,066 children who participated in the E-Risk assessments at age 
18, comprising 55% MZ and 45% DZ twin pairs, with a reasonably even spilt between the 
sexes (47% male). The average age of the twins at the time of the assessment was 18.4 years 
(SD = 0.36); all interviews were conducted after the 18th birthday. There were no differences 
between those who did and did not take part at age 18 in terms of socioeconomic status 
(SES) assessed when the cohort was initially defined (Χ2 = 0.86, p = 0.65), age 5 IQ scores 
(t = 0.98, p = 0.33), age 5 internalizing or externalizing behaviour problems (t = 0.40, p = 
0.69 and t = 0.41, p = 0.68, respectively), childhood bullying victimization (Χ2 = 0.57, p = 
0.75), and age-10 or age-12 weight ratings (t = −1.40, p = 0.16 and t = −.98, p = 0.33, 
respectively). Home visits at ages 5, 7, 10, and 12 years included assessments with 
participants as well as their mother (or primary caretaker); the home visit at age 18 included 
interviews only with the participants. Each twin participant was assessed by a different 
interviewer.
The Joint South London and Maudsley and the Institute of Psychiatry Research Ethics 
Committee approved each phase of the study. Parents gave informed consent and twins gave 
assent between 5–12 years and then informed consent at age 18.
Bullying victimization
We assessed experiences of victimization by bullies using both mothers’ and children’s 
reports of victimization at primary and secondary school (28). We explained, “Someone is 
being bullied when another child (a) says mean and hurtful things, makes fun, or calls a 
person mean and hurtful names; (b) completely ignores or excludes someone from their 
group of friends or leaves them out on purpose; (c) hits, kicks, or shoves a person, or locks 
them in a room; (d) tells lies or spreads rumours about them; and (e) other hurtful things like 
these. We call it bullying when these things happen often, and when it is difficult to make it 
stop. We do not call it bullying when it is done in a friendly or playful way.” Mothers were 
interviewed when children were 7, 10, and 12 years old and asked whether either twin had 
been bullied by another child, responding never, yes, or frequently. We combined mothers’ 
reports from the age 7 and 10 assessments to derive a measure of victimization during 
primary school. Mothers’ reports at the age 12 assessment indexed victimization during 
secondary school. During private interviews with children when they were 12 years old, they 
indicated whether they had been bullied by another child during primary or secondary 
school. Typically, relatively low levels of cross-informant agreement for bullying 
involvement are observed (29, 30). In keeping with other studies, the cross-informant 
agreement between mother and child reports of victimization during primary school and 
secondary school were modest: k = 0.20 during primary school and k = 0.29 during 
secondary school. Although agreement between mothers and children was only modest,

 reports of victimization from both informants were similarly associated with children’s 
internalizing and externalizing problems, suggesting that each informant provides a unique 
but meaningful perspective on bullying victimization (31). The test–retest reliability of 
victimization was 0.87 using a sample of 30 parents who were interviewed twice, 3–6 weeks 
apart. When a mother or a child reported victimization, the interviewer asked them to 
describe what happened. Notes taken by the interviewers were later checked by an 
independent rater to verify that the events reported could be classified as instances of 
bullying operationally defined as evidence of (a) repeated harmful actions (b) between 
children (c) where there is a power differential between the bully and the victim (31). We 
summed mother and child reports of victimization across primary school and separately 
across secondary school to capture all instances of victimization during these two periods. 
As data were positively skewed for both the primary and secondary school measures, we 
divided each index of victimization into three category variables: (0) never victimized 
(primary school: N=872, 39.4%; secondary school: N=1,138, 53.0%), (1) reported by either 
mother or child as being occasionally victimized (primary school: N=646, 29.2%; secondary 
school: N=517, 24.1%), and (2) reported as being victimized by both informants, or as 
frequently victimized by mother or child (primary school; N=696, 31.4%; secondary school: 
N=491, 22.9%). From this information, we derived a measure of chronic bullying 
victimization across primary and early secondary school encompassing exposure over the 
childhood years. The sample was divided into three groups: (0) non-victims (children who 
experienced either occasional or no victimization at primary and secondary school; 
N=1,255, 58.5%), (1) transitory victims (frequently victimized at primary school only or 
secondary school only; N=605, 28.2%), and (2) chronic victims (frequently victimized at 
both primary and secondary school; N=286, 13.3%).
Overweight
Measures of overweight in young adulthood—Trained research workers took 
anthropometric measurements of study members when they were aged 18 years. BMI was 
computed as weight in kilograms over squared height in meters. Waist-hip ratio was 
calculated by dividing waist circumference by hip circumference. Overweight was defined 
according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Criteria according to age- and 
sex-specific growth charts (32). Study members with a BMI equal to or above the 85th 
percentile were classified as overweight.
Measures of overweight in childhood—At the age 10 and 12 assessments, research 
workers rated children’s weights on a 7-point scale (with 1 being underweight and 7 being 
overweight). These ratings were based on visual assessment, with the rationale that victims 
of violence might be targeted because of the perpetrator’s own visual assessment. Research 
worker ratings of weight at age 10 were correlated with their ratings at age 12 (r = 0.58). At 
age 12, research workers also took anthropometric measurements in a subsample of study 
members (N=173). Measured BMI in this subsample at age 12 was correlated with research 
worker ratings of weight at age 12 (r = 0.59) and ratings of weight at age 10 (r = 0.45).

 Covariates
Childhood maltreatment—Methods used to assess childhood maltreatment in our 
sample have been described in detail elsewhere (33, 34). We assessed physical maltreatment 
by an adult using a standardized clinical interview protocol (35) designed to enhance 
mothers’ comfort with reporting valid child maltreatment information, while also meeting 
researchers’ responsibilities for referral under the UK Children Act. No family has left the 
study after intervention. When mothers reported any maltreatment, interviewers followed 
with standardized probes (for example, accidental harm was ruled out; harm by peers was 
coded as bullying, not maltreatment). Sexual abuse was queried directly. Over the years of 
data collection, the study maintained a cumulative dossier for each child, composed of 
recorded debriefings with interviewers who had coded any indication of maltreatment at any 
of the four successive home visits, recorded narratives of the four successive caregiver 
interviews at child ages 5, 7, 10 and 12 years (covering the period from birth to 12 years), 
and information from clinicians whenever the study made a referral. On the basis of the 
review of each child’s cumulative dossier, two clinical psychologists (Professor Terrie E 
Moffitt and the project coordinator) reached consensus for whether physical maltreatment 
had occurred. Examples of maltreatment included the following: the mother smacked the 
child weekly, leaving marks or bruises; child was repeatedly beaten by a young adult 
stepsibling; child was routinely smacked by father when drunk, ‘just to humiliate him’; child 
was fondled sexually and often slapped by the mother’s boyfriend. Many, but not all, cases 
identified in the course of our research were under investigation by the police or social 
services, already on the child protection register, or in foster care at follow-up, having been 
taken away from their parents because of abuse. On the basis of the mother’s report of the 
severity of maltreatment and the interviewer’s rating of the likelihood that the child had been 
physically maltreated, children were coded as having experienced no maltreatment 
(N=1,760, 78.9%), probable maltreatment (N=344, 15.4%) or definite maltreatment (N=128, 
5.7%).
Socioeconomic status—The family socioeconomic status at the age of 5 years was 
defined through a standardized composite of parental income, education and occupation. 
The three socioeconomic status indicators were highly correlated (r = 0.57–0.67) and loaded 
significantly onto one latent factor (36). The population-wide distribution of the resulting 
factor was divided in tertiles for analyses.
Food insecurity—History of food insecurity was reported by the mother to a clinical 
interviewer when children were aged 7 and 10 years using a seven-item scale developed by 
the US Department of Agriculture (37). Using data from both assessments, we classified 
families as having experienced no food insecurity (N=1914, 87.1%), episodic food 
insecurity (if food insecurity was reported at age 7 or age 10 assessments; N=210, 9.6%) or 
sustained food insecurity (food insecurity at both age 7 and age 10 assessments; N=74, 
3.4%).
Child mental health/cognition—We assessed internalizing and externalizing problems 
at age 5 by using the Child Behavior Checklist in face-to-face interviews with mothers and 
requesting the teacher’s report for each child (38, 39). The internalizing problems scale is

 the sum of items in the withdrawn and anxious/depressed subscales, and the externalizing 
problems scale is the sum of items from the aggressive and delinquent subscales. We 
summed and standardised mothers’ and teachers’ reports to create cross-informant scales. 
We tested children’s IQ at age 5 individually by using a short form of the Wechsler 
Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence—Revised (40, 41).
Pubertal development—Pubertal maturation at age 12 was evaluated through maternal 
ratings of Tanner's stages (42) during home visits. Sex-specific variables were combined to 
obtain an overall index of pubertal maturation for each study member.
Genetic risk of overweight—Genetic risk was calculated according to co-twin zygosity 
and overweight status according to a method used previously (43, 44), with coding of 0 for 
the monozygotic co-twin of a non-overweight twin (lowest risk), 1 for the dizygotic co-twin 
of a non-overweight twin, 2 for the dizygotic co-twin of an overweight twin, and 3 for the 
monozygotic co-twin of an overweight twin (highest risk).
Birth weight—Each twin's birth weight was obtained by means of parental recall when the 
twins were 1 year old (45).
Statistical analyses
First, we tested whether the chronicity of childhood bullying victimization predicted being 
overweight at age 18 in a logistic regression model. Second, we tested whether the 
association between childhood bullying victimization and overweight at age 18 generalized 
to continuous measures of BMI and waist-hip ratio at age 18, in linear regression models. 
Third, we tested whether the association between childhood bullying victimization and 
overweight at age 18 in the above models was accounted for by child maltreatment. Fourth, 
we tested whether the association between childhood bullying victimization and overweight 
at age 18 was accounted for by socio-economic status and food insecurity, child mental 
health/cognition, and pubertal development. Finally, we tested whether childhood bullying 
victimization preceded overweight, by (1) testing whether bullied children were overweight 
at ages 10 and 12, and (2) testing whether childhood bullying victimization predicted 
overweight at age 18 after accounting for (i) weight at ages 10 and 12, and (ii) genetic risk 
of overweight and birth weight. We adjusted for the effects of sex and ethnicity in all 
multivariate analyses. To correct for the inclusion of two study children in each family, we 
adjusted all analyses for the effect of familial clustering (using the option cluster in STATA 
SE,13th edition). Pregnant women were removed from all analyses.
Results
Is the association between childhood bullying victimization and overweight at age 18 
influenced by the chronicity of exposure?
Bullied children were more likely to be overweight at age 18 than non-bullied children 
(Table 1; Figure 1). The risk of being overweight increased as a function of the chronicity of 
bullying victimization, with children bullied in both primary school and secondary school

 showing the highest risk of being overweight (Table 2- baseline model). Effects were similar 
in boys and girls (sex-interaction term p-value=0.41).
Is the association between bullying victimization and overweight at age 18 consistent 
across different measures?
Bullied children also showed higher BMI and waist-hip ratio at age 18 than non-bullied 
children (Table 1; Figure 1). The association between bullying victimization and BMI was 
only seen in chronically victimized children, whereas children who experienced either 
transitory or chronic victimization had a greater waist-hip ratio than controls (Table 2- 
baseline model). Again, these effects were similar in boys and girls (sex-interaction terms p-
value=0.23 for BMI and p=0.53 for waist-hip ratio).
Is the association between bullying victimization and overweight at age 18 explained by 
co-occurring maltreatment?
Bullied children were more likely to have experienced maltreatment than non-bullied 
children (Table 1). In turn, child maltreatment predicted higher waist-hip ratio at age 18 
(Table 3) and an elevated risk of being overweight in females (definite maltreatment: 
OR=2.18, 95% CI=1.07–4.45), but not in males (definite maltreatment: OR=1.04, 95% CI=
−0.49–2.20). However, even after accounting for maltreatment by an adult, bullied children 
were more likely to be overweight at age 18 than non-bullied children (Table 2- model 1).
Is the association between bullying victimization and overweight at age 18 independent of 
confounding by psychosocial risks and child characteristics?
Bullying victimization was associated with psychosocial risk factors (socioeconomic 
disadvantage and food insecurity), poor childhood mental health/cognition (externalizing 
problems, internalizing problems, and low IQ), and early pubertal development (Table 1). 
With the exception of child internalizing problems, these variables all predicted overweight 
at age 18 (Table 3). However, bullied children showed an elevated risk of overweight at age 
18 regardless of their psychosocial risk, mental health/cognition, and pubertal development 
(Table 2– models 2, 3, and 4).
Does bullying victimization precede overweight?
At the time of bullying victimization (at ages 10 and 12 years), bullied children were not 
perceived by research workers to be more overweight than non-bullied children (Table 1). 
Similarly, bullied children did not show a higher risk of overweight, BMI, or waist-hip ratio 
at age 12, in a subsample (N=173) with anthropometric measures (Table 1). Furthermore, the 
association between bullying victimization and overweight at age 18 remained after 
accounting for childhood weight ratings (Table 2- model 5), as well as genetic risk of 
overweight and birth weight (Table 2- model 6).
Discussion
This cohort study showed that childhood bullying victimization is associated with 
overweight in young adulthood. First, we found some evidence of a dose-response 
relationship, in that the risk of being overweight increased as a function of the chronicity of

 bullying victimization in unadjusted analyses. Second, the association between bullying 
victimization and overweight was consistent across different measures of overweight, 
including categorical and continuous measures of BMI, and waist-hip ratio, a measure of 
central adiposity. Third, the findings were specific to bullying victimization by peers and not 
explained by co-occurring maltreatment by adults. Fourth, bullied children exhibited greater 
risk of overweight independent of potential confounders, such as socioeconomic status and 
food insecurity, child mental health/cognition, and pubertal development. Finally, the 
association was consistent with the hypothesized temporal priority, in that bullied children 
were not overweight at the time of victimization, but became overweight in young adulthood 
independent of (i) prior weight in childhood and (ii) pre-existing genetic and fetal liability.
Our findings should be considered in the context of some limitations. First, we studied a 
cohort of twins and our findings may not generalize to singletons. However, the prevalence 
of bullying and overweight in this sample is similar to that shown in studies of singletons 
(bullying prevalence: 42% by age 12 in E-Risk vs. 37% by age 13 in the Avon Longitudinal 
Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)(46); overweight prevalence at age 18: 23% in E-
Risk vs. 23% in ALSPAC (47)). Second, we did not have anthropometric measures in 
childhood for the whole sample and relied on researcher workers’ ratings of weight at ages 
10 and 12, which may be liable to misclassification. However, the validity of these measures 
was supported by evidence that weight ratings at ages 10 and 12 (i)were correlated with 
body mass measured at age 12 in a subsample, and (ii)predicted overweight measures at age 
18. Third, because we did not measure overweight throughout the observational period for 
bullying exposure, we cannot rule out the possibility that victims of bullying were 
overweight at some point in childhood, as some (13, 21, 48) but not all (14) studies have 
shown. However, it is unlikely that reverse causation accounted for the findings, as bullied 
children became overweight at age 18 independent of childhood weight ratings and genetic 
and fetal liability to overweight. Fourth, unmeasured variables may have confounded the 
findings. Therefore, it is reassuring that our findings are consistent with experimental 
research from non-human primates (6, 7). Despite these limitations, our findings have 
implications for future research, clinical practice, and public health.
With regard to future research, studies should identify the mechanisms underlying the 
association between early life stress and overweight in later life. Our findings are consistent 
with the allostatic load theory prediction that more chronic exposure to psychosocial stress is 
associated with the greatest metabolic abnormalities (49). It is possible that early life stress 
could give rise to a 'thrifty' phenotype, characterized by high energy intake and/or low 
energy expenditure (8). For example, children exposed to early life stress may eat more, due 
to impaired inhibitory control over feeding linked to prefrontal cortex abnormalities (49). 
These children may also ‘self-medicate’ with high-calorie food to dampen chronic HPA axis 
activation (50). These hypotheses are consistent with evidence showing that childhood 
bullying victimization predicts bulimia and binge eating (51). Children exposed to early life 
stress may also expend less energy due to inflammation-related fatigue and physical 
inactivity (14, 52). In addition to biological explanations, social mechanisms may operate. 
For example, bullied children may avoid group sporting activities to reduce the risk of 
further victimization from peers. It is important to identify such mechanisms to inform the

 development of clinical interventions to prevent maltreated and bullied children from 
becoming overweight.
With regard to clinical practice, efforts should be made to support bullied children in order 
to prevent them from becoming overweight. It is possible that addressing unhealthy 
behaviors, such as comfort eating and physical inactivity (53), could help prevent bullied 
children from becoming overweight. Such unhealthy behaviors might be partly linked to 
mental illness, and thus holistic approaches may bring the greatest benefits.
With regard to public health, our findings further highlight the importance of investing in 
anti-bullying interventions. Given the high prevalence of bullying and overweight, it is 
possible that effective anti-bullying strategies, such as targeted policies (11) and whole-
school interventions (10), could help reduce the large public health burden due to 
overweight.

Results are presented as means and standard errors unless otherwise stated.
*Associations with continuous variables were estimated with linear regression models and associations with categorical variables were estimated with logistic regression models adjusted for familial 
clustering.
aChildhood bullying victimization was assessed between ages 5–12 years.
bAt the age-12 follow-up, research workers took anthropometric measurements in a subsample of 173 study members (no victimization: n=78; transitory victimization: n=54; chronic victimization: n=41). 
The cut-off for overweight at 12 years was BMI ≥ 21 for males and BMI ≥ 21.7 for females, in accordance to 85th percentile from CDC growth charts (32)
cResearch workers rated study members’ weights on a scale from 1 (underweight) to 7 (overweight)

Results are presented as odds ratios (for overweight) or unstandardized regression coefficients (for BMI and waist-hip ratio) with 95% confidence intervals. Values for waist-hip ratio were multiplied by 100 
for these analyses.
Data on covariates were missing from between <1% (child IQ, food insecurity, and weight rating at age 12) to 7% (birth weight), with an average of 2.9% missing. We replaced missing values for covariates 
with means of the observed data, resulting in N=1,976 for analyses on overweight and BMI, and N=1,987 for analyses on waist-hip ratio. Sensitivity analyses showed similar findings regardless of whether 
we replaced missing data, conducted a complete case analysis, or used listwise deletion.
