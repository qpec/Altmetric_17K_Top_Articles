ABSTRACT
Objective To estimate the prevalence of a
comprehensive set of self-reported sleep problems by job
characteristics, including shiftwork status, among a
representative sample of US workers.
Methods Data for 6338 workers aged ≥18 years were
obtained from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey. Short sleep duration was defined as
<7 hours per weekday/workday. Sleep quality was
categorised as good, moderate and poor based on the
frequency of 6 sleep-related symptoms. A sleep-related
activities of daily living (ADL) score ≥2 was defined as
impaired. Insomnia was defined as having poor sleep
quality and impaired ADL. Shiftwork status was
categorised as daytime, night, evening, rotating or
another schedule. Prevalence rates were calculated and
multivariate logistic regression analyses were used.
Results The prevalence of short sleep duration (37.6%
overall) was highest among night shift workers (61.8%;
p<0.001). The prevalence of poor sleep quality was
19.2% among all workers, with the highest prevalence
among night shift workers (30.7%, p=0.004). The
prevalence of impaired ADL score (24.8% overall) and
insomnia (8.8% overall) was also highest for night shift
workers (36.2%, p=0.001 and 18.5%, p=0.013,
respectively). In multivariate analysis, night shift workers
had the highest likelihood of these sleep problems.
Conclusions Self-reported short sleep duration, poor
sleep quality, impaired ADL score and insomnia are
common among US workers especially among night shift
workers. Although these findings should be confirmed
with objective sleep measures, they support the need for
intervention programmes to improve sleep quantity and
quality among night shift workers.
INTRODUCTION
Although sleep is essential to health and well-
being,
an
estimated
50–70
million
Americans
suffer from a sleep disorder.1 Short sleep dur-
ation (<7 hours/day) has been shown in some
studies to be associated with many chronic health
problems, including immune dysfunction, obesity,
diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and
all-cause mortality risk.2–4 Sleepiness and fatigue,
the consequences of short sleep duration, have
been linked to undesirable job impacts, including
productivity loss5 and adverse safety outcomes.6 7
Sleep
deficiency
is
thus
an
important
public
health problem affecting a large proportion of
the US population, and costs billions of dollars
annually.8
W
orkers with irregular work schedules and those
not working the 09:00 to 17:00 time frame are
increasingly needed to meet the demands of globali-
sation and a 24-hour society. According to the Sleep
in America Poll, 25% of the workers in the USA
reported that their current work schedule does not
permit sufficient sleep.9 Shift workers are known to
have more sleep-related problems than the general
population, including difficulty falling asleep, not
getting enough sleep and sleepiness on waking.10 11
T
o date, little is known about the prevalence of
sleep-related problems in the US working population
as the majority of studies are limited to selected
occupational groups or geographic regions12 13 with
limited generalisability. Furthermore, most of the
studies focused on a few specific problems, such as
short sleep duration14 15 or insomnia.5 Therefore,
using nationally representative data from National
Health
and
Nutrition
Examination
Survey
(NHANES), we (1) estimated the prevalence of a
comprehensive set of self-reported sleep problems
by job characteristics, including shiftwork status,
selected
sociodemographic
characteristics,
and
health and lifestyle factors among US workers; and
(2) performed an in-depth examination of the asso-
ciation between these sleep problems and shiftwork
status, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics
and other potential confounders.
What this paper adds
▸ Little is known about the prevalence of sleep-
related problems in the US working population.
▸ This is the first study to use a nationally
representative sample of the US working
population to examine the role of shiftwork on
sleep quality, sleep-related activities of daily
living (ADL) and insomnia.
▸ Short sleep duration, poor sleep quality,
impaired sleep-related ADL and insomnia were
common among US workers, especially among
night shift workers.
▸ Work-based programmes and policies should
be adopted to improve the quantity and quality
of sleep among workers.

 METHODS
Study design and population
Data from NHANES, a continuous series of cross-sectional
surveys conducted by the National Center of Health Statistics
(NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
were used. A detailed description of the recruitment, design and
surveys
is
available
online
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/
about_nhanes.htm). Briefly, data were collected in 2-year cycles
using a stratified multistage probability design to ensure a
nationally representative sample of the non-institutionalised US
civilian
population.
Participants
were
interviewed
in
their
homes, followed by an invitation to undergo various examina-
tions,
provide
a
blood
sample
and
complete
additional
questionnaires.
The current analysis was limited to the NHANES 2005–2006
and 2007–2008 cycles only. Detailed data on sleep habits and
sleep-related problems were not collected before 2005 or after
2008. The unweighted response rates for the two cycles were
78.4% and 75.4%, respectively. Since the exposure of interest
was shiftwork, we excluded participants who were unemployed
in the past week. This left an analytical sample of 6338 adults
aged ≥18 years. All participants gave written informed consent.
The NHANES study protocol was approved by the NCHS
Research Ethics Review Board.
Sleep-related variables
Study participants completed a sleep questionnaire that included
items from previously validated instruments.16
Sleep duration
Sleep duration was determined from the question, ‘How much
sleep do you usually get at night on weekdays or workdays?’
with responses recorded in whole hours and ≥12 hours coded
as ‘12’. This question did not have a specific time component
(eg, in the last week or month). Based on the National Sleep
Foundation recommendation that adults should sleep 7–9 hours
per night,17 two categories of sleep duration were created: <7
(ie,
short
sleep
duration)
and
≥7 hours
per
weekday or
workday.
Sleep disorders
Physician-diagnosed sleep disorders were first identified by a
‘yes’ response to the question, ‘Have you ever been told by a
doctor or other health professional that you have a sleep dis-
order?’. This was followed by questions to ascertain the specific
type of diagnosed disorder: sleep apnoea; insomnia; restless leg
syndrome; or ‘other’. Self-reported sleep latency or time to
sleep was categorised as <30 and ≥30 min based on the ques-
tion, ‘How long does it usually take you to fall asleep at
bedtime?’ (ie, without a time component). Frequent use of
sleeping pills was defined as taking sleeping pills or other medi-
cation to help sleep five or more times in the preceding month.
Sleep quality
Self-reported trouble sleeping and ever having told a physician
about trouble sleeping were assessed. Ever telling a physician
about trouble sleeping was defined as answering ‘yes’ to ‘Have
you ever told a doctor or other health professional that you
have trouble sleeping?’. Self-reported sleep symptoms in the
past month was assessed by asking about the following six sleep
symptoms: (1) trouble falling asleep; (2) waking up during the
night and having trouble getting back to sleep; (3) waking up
too early in the morning and being unable to get back to sleep;
(4) feeling unrested during the day, no matter how many hours
of sleep were obtained; (5) feeling excessively or overly sleepy
during the day and (6) not getting enough sleep. Each self-
reported sleep symptom was considered frequent if the response
was five or more times a month. W
e also created a sleep quality
index by combining the frequency of self-reported sleep symp-
toms.18 Participants were categorised as having ‘poor’ sleep
quality if the response to any of the six self-reported sleep
symptoms was 16–30 times a month; else as having ‘moderate’
sleep quality if at least one response was 5–15 times a month;
and all other participants were defined as having ‘good’ sleep
quality.
Sleep-related activities of daily living impairment
Participants also completed a general productivity subscale of
the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire.19 The follow-
ing eight items assessed the difficulty in performing certain
activities of daily living (ADL) generally (ie, without a time com-
ponent) due to excessive sleepiness: (1) concentrating on things,
(2) remembering things, (3) eating or finishing a meal, (4)
working on a hobby, (5) getting things done because too sleepy
to drive or take public transportation, (6) taking care of finan-
cial affairs and doing paperwork (eg, paying bills), (7) perform-
ing paid or volunteer work and (8) maintaining a telephone
conversation. Responses to each item were assigned a score:
0=no difficulty, 1=a little difficulty, 2=moderate difficulty and
3=severe difficulty (all other responses, including ‘do not do
this activity’, were set to missing). The scores for the completed
eight items were summed and participants were dichotomised
based on the sample mean of 2.20 A score ≥2 suggests a greater
amount of ADL impairment from sleep compared to those with
a score <2.
Insomnia
Insomnia was loosely based on the definitions and criteria of the
American Psychiatric Association (APA).21 Participants were
categorised as having insomnia if they met these two conditions:
(1) had poor sleep quality as defined above and (2) an ADL
score suggesting impaired function (ie, ADL score ≥2).
Job exposures/characteristics
Shiftwork status was determined by the question: ‘Which best
describes the hours you usually work?’. The response options
were (1) regular daytime schedule (‘work anytime between
06:00 and 18:00’), (2) regular evening shift (‘work anytime
between 14:00 and midnight’), (3) regular night shift (‘work
anytime between 17:00 and 08:00’), (4) rotating shift (‘a work
shift that changes periodically from days to evenings or nights’)
or (5) another schedule (‘a split shift consisting of two distinct
work periods each day, an irregular schedule arranged by the
employer, or any other schedule’). W
e also assessed the effect of
other job-related characteristics on sleep: duration of current
main job (<10 vs ≥10 years), hours worked in all jobs in the
preceding week (<48 vs ≥48 hours) and the occupation cate-
gory for the main job (three categories: service, farm/blue collar
and white collar).
Covariates
Several self-reported potential confounders were assessed: age,
gender,
race/ethnicity,
marital
status
and
education
level.
Socioeconomic status was assessed by the poverty income ratio
(PIR), which was calculated as the ratio of self-reported family
income to the poverty threshold level according to US Census
Bureau poverty guidelines.22 PIR was categorised as <1 (below

 the poverty threshold), 1 to <3 and ≥3 (representing family
income three or more times the poverty threshold). The
health-related potential confounders included self-rated general
health status dichotomised into two groups: excellent, very
good or good health versus fair or poor health. Health insur-
ance status was dichotomised as covered by any type of health
insurance versus not insured. Prescription medication use was
also dichotomised (yes vs no).
During the examination, weight and height were measured.
Body mass index was calculated using these measurements and
categorised as <25.0 (underweight/normal weight), 25.0–29.9
(overweight) and ≥30.0 (obese). Current smoking status was
assessed using serum cotinine; those with levels >10 ng/mL
were considered smokers and those with levels ≤10 ng/mL were
considered non-smokers. Data were also collected on self-
reported use of two substances that may affect sleep: alcohol
and caffeine. Average daily caffeine intake (in mg) was calculated
from fluid (coffee, tea and soda) and food sources (chocolate)
reported in two 24-hour dietary recalls, and categorised into
quartiles based on intake distribution.
Depression was assessed using a validated questionnaire.23
Participants were asked about nine symptoms over the previous
2-week period (ie, little interest in doing things; feeling down,
depressed or hopeless; trouble sleeping or sleeping too much;
feeling tired or having little energy; poor appetite or overeating;
feeling bad about yourself; trouble concentrating on things;
moving or speaking slowly or too fast; and thinking it is prefer-
able to be dead). The frequency of each symptom was assigned
a score: 0=not at all, 1=several days, 2=more than half the
days and 3=nearly every day. The symptom scores were
summed, which ranged between 0 and 27. A summed score of
≥10 was defined as having symptomatic depression.23
Statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted using SAS V
.9.3 (SAS Institute,
Cary, North Carolina, USA) and SAS-callable SUDAAN V
.11.0.0
(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina, USA) to account for the complex survey design. To
obtain
results
that
would
be
generalisable
to
the
non-
institutionalised
US civilian
population,
all
estimates
were
weighted to account for the unequal probabilities of selection,
oversampling and non-response. The sample weights for the
combined 4-year data were constructed by multiplying the pro-
vided 2-year mobile examination centre sample weights by one
half.24
Prevalence (%) and 95% CIs for each of the sleep problems
were estimated for all study participants combined and stratified
by sociodemographic characteristics, health factors, lifestyle
factors, job characteristics and certain sleep characteristics.
Imputed values for missing components of the sleep quality
index (n=10 participants), ADL score (n=200 participants) and
depression score (n=16) were assigned using the method of
Raaijmakers.25 Imputation of missing items occurred only when
at least one component was non-missing. If all components of
the scale were missing, no imputation was performed (no imput-
ation was performed for 13 participants on the ADL score and
for 544 participants on the depression score; all participants
had values for at least one component of the sleep quality
index). W
ald χ2 tests were used to examine differences in the
prevalence of sleep problems across the categories of shiftwork
status and across several other covariates. Estimates with a rela-
tive SE (RSE) >30% but ≤50% are noted in the tables as they
do not meet the NCHS standards of reliability/precision;
however, no RSE was >50%. All comparisons reported in the
Results section are statistically different at a significance level of
0.05; however, not all significant differences are reported in the
Results section.
Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the relation-
ship between shiftwork status (as the exposure variable) and the
binary outcomes of sleep duration, sleep-related ADL score and
insomnia. For the sleep quality index, a multinomial logistic
regression analysis was used. Simple logistic regression was first
performed to assess the relationship between each outcome and
the independent variables to identify potential confounders.
Multicollinearity was assessed by examining associations among
all explanatory variables. A multivariate logistic regression
model was fitted for each outcome and included the sociodemo-
graphic characteristics of age group, gender, race/ethnicity and
education level as well as all other factors that had p<0.05 in
the univariate analysis. A backwards elimination approach was
next used. Since the models for each sleep outcome were similar
with or without further adjustment for physician-diagnosed
sleep disorder and frequent use of sleeping pills, only the results
without such adjustment are presented. Results are reported
using prevalence ratio (PR) and their 95% CI. A p value of
<0.05 from the W
ald test was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
The study sample included 6338 non-institutionalised, US civi-
lian adults (3418 men and 2920 women) who were employed
in the week preceding interview. The majority of workers
reported that they regularly worked in the daytime (72.1%),
4.4% worked the night shift (representing 6.3 million US
workers) and 23.5% worked on another shift (6.0% evening
shift, 9.0% rotating shift and 8.5% another schedule) with data
missing for two workers. The distribution of demographic and
continuous sleep variables (ie, sleep duration and sleep latency)
is provided in table 1.
Prevalence of selected sleep-related problems
The prevalence of short sleep duration was 37.6% among all
workers, representing 54.1 million US workers (table 2). The
prevalence of short sleep duration was lower among daytime
workers (35.9%) compared with night shift (61.8%) workers.
Of the workers with physician-diagnosed sleep disorders, sleep
apnoea had the highest prevalence (3.9%), followed by insom-
nia (0.9%), restless leg syndrome (0.3%) and ‘other’ types
(1.0%)
(data
not
shown).
The
prevalence
of
prolonged
sleep-onset latency (≥30 min) was lower among the daytime
workers (31.0%) compared with the night shift
(46.2%),
evening shift (43%) and rotating shift (42.1%) workers.
The overall prevalence of good, moderate and poor sleep
quality among all workers was 53.5%, 27.3% and 19.2% (ie,
representing 76.9, 39.4 and 27.6 million US workers), respect-
ively. Night shift workers had the highest prevalence of poor
sleep quality (30.7%) and workers on another schedule had the
highest prevalence of moderate sleep quality (34.1%) (table 2).
Among all workers combined, the prevalence of specific self-
reported sleep symptoms varied from 14% to 27%. Night and
evening shift workers compared with the daytime workers had a
higher prevalence of frequent trouble falling asleep (21.7% and
21.2%, respectively, vs 12.7%, table 2). Night shift workers and
those on another schedule also had a higher prevalence of not
getting enough sleep (37.2% and 32.8%, respectively, vs 25.2%
among daytime shift workers, table 2). Compared with the
daytime workers, the night shift workers also had a higher
prevalence of frequently feeling excessively or overly sleepy
during the day (22.3% vs 16.2%).

 The prevalence of impaired sleep-related ADL was 24.8%
among all workers (ie, 35.6 million US workers) with a higher
prevalence among the night shift (36.2%) compared with
daytime (23.7%) workers. The prevalence of insomnia was
8.8% among all workers (ie, representing 12.7 million US
workers) with a higher prevalence among the night shift
(18.5%) compared with daytime (8.4%) workers.
Sleep-related problems by sleep duration and shift
Among all workers combined, those who sleep <7 hours were
more likely to have poor sleep quality, impaired ADL and insom-
nia compared to those who sleep 7 hours or more (figure 1). This
finding was also true for day shift workers, night shift workers,
rotating shift workers and workers of another schedule. Among
regular night shift workers who sleep <7 hours, the prevalence
of each sleep problem was higher compared to day shift workers
in the same sleep duration category.
Predictors of selected sleep-related problems
W
orkers aged ≥60 years had a lower prevalence of short sleep
duration, impaired sleep-related ADL and insomnia compared
with those aged 30–59 years (table 3). Female workers had a
lower prevalence of short sleep duration but higher prevalence
of the other three sleep outcomes compared to male workers.
W
orkers with PIR ≥3 had a lower prevalence of poor sleep
quality, impaired sleep-related ADL and insomnia compared
with those with PIR <1. Obese workers had a higher prevalence
of short sleep duration and poor sleep quality compared with
those who were normal weight/underweight. Current smokers
had a higher prevalence of short sleep duration, poor sleep
quality and insomnia (but not impaired sleep-related ADL) com-
pared with non-smokers. W
orkers who worked ≥48 hours had a
higher prevalence of short sleep duration, poor sleep quality
and insomnia compared with those who worked <48 hours per
week. W
orkers with frequent use of sleeping pills had a higher
prevalence of poor sleep quality, impaired sleep-related ADL

 and insomnia (but not short sleep duration) compared to those
without. Finally, compared to workers without these character-
istics, a higher prevalence of all four sleep outcomes was
observed among workers who were widowed, divorced or sepa-
rated; workers who reported fair or poor health; workers with
symptomatic depression; and workers who had a physician-
diagnosed sleep disorder.
Modelling of sleep problems and shiftwork status
Compared with daytime workers, night shift workers were more
likely to have short sleep duration (model 2: PR=1.70; 95% CI
1.48 to 1.96) (table 4). The likelihood of poor self-reported
sleep quality, impaired sleep-related ADL and insomnia was
higher among night shift workers compared with daytime
workers (PR=1.52, 1.39 and 2.03, respectively). The likelihood
of moderate self-reported sleep quality was higher among
workers on another schedule compared with daytime workers
(model 2: PR=1.25; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.47).
DISCUSSION
Using 2005–2008 NHANES data, we found that sleep-related
problems were common in a nationally representative sample of
US adult workers. Furthermore, night shift workers had a
higher risk for all of these sleep problems, and these higher
risks persisted after adjustment for potential confounders,
including long work hours (≥48 hours/week), sociodemographic
characteristics and health/lifestyle/work factors.
Although it has long been recognised that shift workers, par-
ticularly those working in the night shift, have more sleep pro-
blems or sleepiness than daytime workers,12 13 26 to the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to use a nationally repre-
sentative sample of the US working population to examine the
role of shiftwork on sleep quality, sleep-related ADL and insom-
nia. The sleep problems we observed may be explained by a
desynchronisation between the circadian system and the sleep/
wake cycle that has been detected in night shift workers.12 27
Although we only reported on the sleep problems present at the
time of interview, the sleep problems observed among night
shift workers may not quickly reverse by switching to day shift.
Instead, the effects of shiftwork on sleep duration and sleep
quality may persist into retirement,28 although this is disputed
by others.29
Sleep-related problems were significantly more prevalent
among those with short sleep duration, especially among night
shift workers (figure 1), consistent with previous reports. In the
general population, it has previously been found that sleep dur-
ation is lower among those with insomnia,30 and those with
short sleep duration are more likely to have impaired ADL31
and poor sleep quality.32 This coexistence of short sleep dur-
ation with other sleep problems is cause for concern. For
example, there appears to be a synergism between short sleep
duration and poor sleep quality in their effect on health out-
comes, as those with both had the highest risk for coronary
heart disease3 and all-cause mortality.4
W
e found that 25% of all workers have sleep-related ADL
impairment, similar to that observed for the general popula-
tion,31 which rose to 36% among regular night shift workers.
Such impairment of ADL activities and poor sleep quality may
contribute to some of the adverse outcomes observed among
night shift workers, including increased fatal and non-fatal
injury rates,33 reckless behaviour (eg, unsafe driving, excessive
drinking,
poor
diet
and
higher
smoking
prevalence)
and
impaired work performance.34 For example, the reasons for an

 elevated smoking prevalence among shift workers may include
its effects on relieving fatigue and sleepiness.35
Prevalence estimates of short sleep duration from nationally
representative samples of US workers vary. While we reported
a prevalence of 38% using NHANES data, the 2004–200714
and 201015 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) reported
a 30% prevalence among US workers, which are in line with
estimates for the general US population from NHANES and
NHIS, respectively.31 36 The NHANES and NHIS discrepan-
cies may be due to the difference in how these surveys ask
about sleep duration. NHANES asks about the amount of
sleep obtained at night on weekdays or workdays, whereas
NHIS asks ‘on average, how many hours of sleep do you get in
a 24-hour period?’. Since NHANES only asked about amount
of sleep ‘at night’, night shift workers may have difficulty with
their response since they typically do not sleep at night. This
may also explain why the prevalence estimates for short sleep
duration among night shift workers differed between our study
(62%) and NHIS (44%).15 In addition, NHANES asked about
sleep duration on workdays, whereas NHIS asked about
‘a 24-hour period’ without distinguishing between workdays
and non-workdays. The amount of sleep obtained on a
workday may be a better measure of work-related short sleep
duration.
Insomnia is a disorder that involves poor sleep quality and
impaired sleep-related ADL function.21 In contrast to sleep
duration, few estimates on insomnia prevalence in the working
population exist. The APA reported that 6–10% of the US
population has insomnia disorder,21 which is consistent with the
9% prevalence we found among US workers. However, in a
study of workers enrolled in a national US commercial health
plan between 2008 and 2009, self-reported insomnia prevalence
was 23%.5 Kessler et al5 defined insomnia in a manner more
consistent with the APA definition (eg, their definition required
night-time symptoms occurring three or more times/week vs
NHANES data which can identify high frequency sleep symp-
toms only when they occurred at least 16 times per month).
Neither Kessler et al5 nor our study included two other APA
definitional criteria for insomnia: sleep difficulty present at least
3 months and exclusion of secondary insomnia.
Study limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design
limits making inferences regarding the direction of our observed
sleep–shiftwork association; for example, there may be self-
selection into a given shift according to sleep characteristics.
Second, our findings are based on self-reports and may be prone to
misclassification bias. For example, comparisons of sleep duration
based on self-reports versus actigraphy and polysomnography have
shown that self-reports often overestimate sleep duration, except
those with short sleep duration often underestimate sleep dur-
ation.37 38 Fortunately
, these earlier studies comparing self-report
and objective sleep duration suggest that our distribution of dicho-
tomised sleep duration may be accurate. Third, although we are
not aware of studies to establish the psychometric properties of the
sleep quality index we used, it has been used previously to examine
the effect of sleep quality on hypertension.18 Fourth, data were
incomplete for several covariates. The exclusion of workers with
missing covariates may result in selection bias and residual con-
founding by unmeasured covariates. However, we think the poten-
tial for such bias and confounding is low because the magnitude of
the association between shiftwork status and sleep problems
remained essentially unchanged with or without adjustment for
various sociodemographic/lifestyle/work factors. Fifth, there is a
possibility that night shift workers’ response to some sleep ques-
tions, such as ‘waking too early in the morning’ and ‘feeling exces-
sively sleepy during the day’, may be inaccurate as they likely slept
during the day. Finally
, due to a lack of data, we were unable to
evaluate shift characteristics (eg, number of years employed on a
given shift; speed, direction and pattern of rotating shifts; and
amount of time off between shifts) and due to small sample size,
we were unable to evaluate detailed industry and occupation
categories, each of which may modify the association between
shiftwork and sleep. For example, those with a long tenure on
night shift may be more tolerant of that shift as demonstrated by
the absence of an elevated injury risk among such workers.39

 Recommendations
Although night shift is associated with all of the sleep problems
we investigated, some workers are better able to tolerate night
shifts, as demonstrated by the fact that not all night shift
workers had sleep problems. These higher tolerant workers may
be more receptive to the advantages to night shiftwork which
include: commuting when roads are less crowded, higher wages
to compensate for the inconvenience of night shift, enjoying
public places that are often less crowded when they are off
work and having greater independence since fewer supervisors
may be present on night shifts.
Given the likely growth in the demands from globalisation and
societies’ need for services around the clock, work-based preven-
tion programmes and policies should be adopted to improve the
quantity and quality of sleep among workers. Unfortunately,
there is no single ideal strategy to successfully address the sleep
risks of every demanding shiftwork situation. Instead, interven-
tions often need to be customised to the specific employer and
worker.40 These include designing new shift schedules with fre-
quent rest breaks, avoiding night shifts that exceed 8 hours,
improving the sleep environment (eg, blocking sunlight and
sound from the bedroom, and keeping the bedroom cool), taking
a long nap before the night shift begins (eg, from 19:30 to
22:00), accelerating the modulation of circadian rhythms using
bright lights, improving physical fitness, engaging in stress reduc-
tion activities, and strengthening family and social support.

*Weighted estimates derived from logistic regression for sleep duration as a binary outcome (<7 hours referenced to ≥7 hours per week/work day), sleep-related ADL score
(≥2 referenced to <2) and insomnia (yes referenced to no); and from multinomial logistic regression for sleep quality index (poor and moderate referenced to good sleep quality).
†No additional information is available on this shift category. This category was selected by the participant if none of the other categories applied. It could include a split shift
consisting of two distinct work periods each day, an irregular schedule arranged by the employer or any other schedule not already specified.
‡Model 1, adjusted for the demographic characteristics of age group, gender, race/ethnicity and education.
§Model 2: model 1 further adjusted for general health status, symptomatic depression, body mass index, current smoking status and weekly working hours.
¶Categorised as poor sleep quality if the response to any of the six sleep problem items was 16–30 times/month; else as moderate sleep quality if any response was 5–15 times/month
and all others as good sleep quality.
**Model 2: model 1 further adjusted for self-rated health status, symptomatic depression, current smoking status and weekly working hours.
††A score ≥2 is considered to indicate a greater daily sleep-related impairment than a score <2.
‡‡Model 2: model 1 further adjusted for self-rated health status, symptomatic depression and prescription medication use.
§§Model 2: model 1 further adjusted for self-rated health status, symptomatic depression, prescription medication use, weekly working hours and alcohol intake.
