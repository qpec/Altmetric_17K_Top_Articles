BACKGROUND: Reliably distinguishing bacterial from viral infections is often challenging, 
leading to antibiotic misuse. A novel assay that integrates measurements of blood-borne 
host-proteins (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, interferon 
γ-induced protein-10, and C-reactive protein [CRP]) was developed to assist in 
differentiation between bacterial and viral disease.
METHODS: We performed double-blind, multicenter assay evaluation using serum remnants 
collected at 5 pediatric emergency departments and 2 wards from children ≥3 months to 
≤18 years without (n = 68) and with (n = 529) suspicion of acute infection. Infectious cohort 
inclusion criteria were fever ≥38°C and symptom duration ≤7 days. The reference standard 
diagnosis was based on predetermined criteria plus adjudication by experts blinded to 
assay results. Assay performers were blinded to the reference standard. Assay cutoffs were 
predefined.
RESULTS: Of 529 potentially eligible patients with suspected acute infection, 100 did not 
fulfill infectious inclusion criteria and 68 had insufficient serum. The resulting cohort 
included 361 patients, with 239 viral, 68 bacterial, and 54 indeterminate reference 
standard diagnoses. The assay distinguished between bacterial and viral patients 
with 93.8% sensitivity (95% confidence interval: 87.8%–99.8%) and 89.8% specificity 
(85.6%–94.0%); 11.7% had an equivocal assay outcome. The assay outperformed CRP 
(cutoff 40 mg/L; sensitivity 88.2% [80.4%–96.1%], specificity 73.2% [67.6%–78.9%]) and 
procalcitonin testing (cutoff 0.5 ng/mL; sensitivity 63.1% [51.0%–75.1%], specificity 82.3% 
[77.1%–87.5%]).
CONCLUSIONS: Double-blinded evaluation confirmed high assay performance in febrile 
children. Assay was significantly more accurate than CRP, procalcitonin, and routine 
laboratory parameters. Additional studies are warranted to support its potential to 
improve antimicrobial treatment decisions.

What’s KnoWn on this subject: Pediatricians are often unsure if a febrile 
child has bacterial or viral disease. Clinical judgment and laboratory tests are 
sometimes insufficient for diagnosis, leading to antibiotic misuse. Recently, a 
host-protein assay for distinguishing bacterial versus viral infections exhibited 
promising accuracy.
What this study adds: This double-blind study evaluated the host-protein 
assay's performance for differentiating between bacterial and viral infections 
in pediatric inpatients and emergency department arrivals. The assay revealed 
accurate results and significantly outperformed routine biomarkers, including 
C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and other laboratory parameters.

 It is estimated that medical attention 
is sought for 250 million episodes of 
acute infectious disease annually in 
the United States, with roughly 40 
million managed in the emergency 
department (ED) setting.1 A major 
challenge to effective management of 
febrile patients, especially children, is 
the clinical difficulty of distinguishing 
between bacterial and viral (or 
other) infections.2 This clinical 
uncertainty drives antibiotic misuse, 
both underuse2 and overuse, 
3 with 
detrimental ramifications for the 
patient, the health care system, and 
society, including the emergence of 
antibiotic resistance.4 
–

Although routine diagnostic tests 
for pathogen detection may aid 
in determining infection etiology, 
they often suffer from 1 or more of 
the following key limitations: (1) 
lengthy time to result; (2) the need 
for obtaining a sample from the 
site of infection, which is often not 
readily accessible; (3) uncertainty 
regarding the clinical interpretation 
of viral identification, which does 
not preclude the possibility of a 
bacterial coinfection7; and (4) false 
alarms caused by the carriage of 
potentially pathogenic microbes that 
are also part of the natural flora (eg, 
Streptococcus pneumoniae).8, 
 
9
Host-based biomarker approaches 
represent a promising complement 
to pathogen-based diagnostics.10 In 
recent studies, authors examining 
host-RNA signatures in response to 
different infections show promising 
results.11 
– 
16 However, quantitative 
and rapid measurement (within 
minutes) of multiple host RNAs 
remains a technical challenge, 
particularly at the point of need. In 
contrast, circulating (particularly 
soluble) host proteins are a 
promising basis for a diagnostic test, 
as they are readily amenable to rapid 
and quantitative measurement by 
using well established technologies. 
Proteins routinely used today to 
support diagnosis of infection 
include procalcitonin (PCT) and 
C-reactive protein (CRP), but these 
markers are subject to interpatient 
variability.17 
– 
22
Recently, a 3-protein host-assay 
was developed, comprising a novel 
viral-induced host protein called 
tumor necrosis factor-related 
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), 
as well as interferon γ-induced 
protein-10 (IP-10) and the traditional 
bacterial-induced protein CRP.23, 
 
24 
This host-signature assay was used 
to accurately differentiate bacterial 
from viral infection etiologies in a 
study of 1002 febrile children and 
adults with a wide range of clinical 
syndromes, pathogens, time from 
symptom onset, and comorbidities: 
sensitivity of 92% (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 88%–96%) and 
specificity of 89% (95% CI: 86%–
93%). However, a validation study 
initiated by investigators external 
to the sponsor, conducted in a 
double-blind manner and focusing 
on children, has been lacking. Of 
note, while this study was under 
review, an independent validation 
study was published that reported 
high assay performance (sensitivity 
of 88% [95% CI: 75%–95%] and 
specificity of 93% [95% CI: 90%–
95%]) and superiority to PCT, CRP, 
and other routine tests in preschool 
children with lower respiratory tract 
infections or fever without source.25
The aim of the current study is to 
validate the assay performance 
in a double-blind, multicenter, 
investigator-driven clinical study 
focusing on pediatric inpatients and 
ED arrivals aged 3 months to 18 
years old.
Methods
study Population
This study used banked, frozen 
serum sample remnants from the 
following sources: (1) pediatric 
patients prospectively recruited 
between 2008 and 2010 from the 
pediatric EDs (PEDs) of 2 tertiary and 
1 secondary hospital in Switzerland, 
where the target populations were 
patients with clinical and radiological 
pneumonia for infectious patients 
and patients with minor elective 
surgery for healthy (noninfectious) 
patients26; (2) pediatric patients 
prospectively recruited between 
2010 and 2013 from the PED of a 
tertiary hospital in Switzerland, 
where the target population for 
infectious patients was patients 
who had fever without identified 
source27; and (3) pediatric patients 
presenting to the PED and pediatric 
wards of 2 secondary hospitals in 
Israel between 2011 and 2013, from 
whom blood was drawn and sent to 
the microbiology laboratories for 
serological analysis. For more details 
about the study population see the 
Supplemental Information.
On the basis of the discharge 
diagnosis of each accompanying 
anonymized medical case record, the 
banked serum samples were divided 
into potentially eligible patients 
with no suspicion of acute infection 
(ie, healthy and/or noninfectious 
patients) and potentially eligible 
patients with suspicion of acute 
infection. Next, the medical case 
records were screened according 
to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Inclusion criteria for potentially 
eligible patients with no suspicion 
of acute infection (ie, healthy and/
or noninfectious) were as follows: 
age ≥3 months and ≤18 years and 
a fever <38°C. Inclusion criteria 
for potentially eligible patients 
with suspicion of acute infection 
were as follows: age ≥3 months 
and ≤18 years and a fever ≥38°C 
documented at clinical encounter 
(Swiss patients), or a peak fever 
≥38°C at some point after symptom 
onset was documented in the medical 
case record (Israeli patients), and 
symptom duration ≤7 days. The 
exclusion criteria for all participants 
were as follows: antibiotic treatment 
duration at the time of serum 
sampling >48 hours; another

index test
The index test is a host-signature 
assay (ImmunoXpert; MeMed 
Diagnostics, Ltd, Tirat Carmel, 
Israel) that is used to measure and 
computationally integrate the blood 
levels of TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP into 
a bacterial/viral likelihood score.23 
On the basis of predefined cutoffs, 
the index test is used to generate 
3 possible outcomes: (1) viral 
infection (or other nonbacterial 
etiology): ImmunoXpert score <35; 
(2) equivocal: 35 ≤ ImmunoXpert 
score ≤65; and (3) bacterial infection 
(including mixed bacterial and viral 
coinfection): ImmunoXpert score 
>65.23,

Reference standard
There is no single gold standard for 
broadly determining the underlying 
etiology for acute infections. 
Therefore, in line with the Standards 
for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy 
and National Institute for Health 
Research Health Technology 
Assessment guidelines for evaluation 
of diagnostic tests, predetermined 
criteria and a panel of experts 
were employed to adjudicate the 
reference standard for each patient 
(for details, see the Supplemental 
Information).28 
– 
31 The experts were 
blinded to the diagnoses of their 
peers to prevent group pressure or 
influential personality bias and were 
blinded to the host-signature assay 
result.
For the primary analysis, a reference 
standard outcome of bacterial or 
viral etiology was assigned when the 
majority of the panel, that is, at least 
2 of the 3 panel members, gave the 
same diagnosis, and predetermined 
criteria were fulfilled. A reference 
standard outcome of indeterminate 
was assigned when at least 2 of the 3 
panel members diagnosed the patient 
as indeterminate or when there was 
no majority.
For the secondary analysis, the 
diagnostic performance of the 
host-signature assay was evaluated 
by employing 2 alternative, and 
increasingly stringent, approaches 
to assigning reference standard 
outcomes: (1) unanimous: a 
bacterial/viral outcome required 
that all 3 panel members assign  
the same diagnosis plus fulfillment 
of predetermined criteria; and  
(2) microbiologically confirmed:  
in addition to a unanimous 
diagnosis, a bacterial outcome 
required proven (according  
to the predetermined criteria) 
bacteremia, bacterial meningitis, 
lower/upper urinary tract infection, 
acute tonsillitis or peritonsillar 
abscess, and a viral outcome 
required detection of 1 or more 
viruses.
blinding Procedure
The study was conducted in a double-
blind manner. Specifically, index test 
performers were blinded to reference 
standard outcomes, and the assay 
was performed on anonymized 
samples. Additionally, all personnel 
involved in generating the clinical 
database and reference standard 
outcomes were blinded to the index 
test outcomes. The index test and 
reference standard outcomes were 
locked before unblinding.
statistical analysis
A statistical analysis plan was written 
in accordance with the International 
Conference on Harmonization 
topic E9 and the Standards for 
Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy 
recommendations30, 
 
31 and was 
signed off on before unblinding.
Primary analysis of diagnostic 
performance was based on 
sensitivity and specificity 
(Supplemental Information). 
By definition, the cases with 
indeterminate reference standard 
outcomes could not be included 
in the diagnostic performance 
analysis. However, the distribution 
of index test scores among these 
patients was examined as a 
subgroup analysis.
Standard cutoffs of routine 
laboratory parameters and 
biomarkers were predefined for 
evaluation of their diagnostic 
performance; for details, see the 
Supplemental Information.
Results
characteristics of study Population
In total, 597 banked samples were 
potentially eligible for evaluation: 
529 from patients with suspicion 
of acute infection noted on their 
medical case record and 68 from 
patients without suspicion of an 
acute infectious disease (Fig 1A). 
Since the host-signature assay is 
intended to aid the clinician in 
discriminating between bacterial 
and viral infections when there is a 
clear suspicion of acute infection, the 
cohort for primary analysis included 
the potentially eligible infectious 
patients (Fig 1B); an exploratory 
analysis that also includes the 
patients without suspicion of 
acute infection (ie, healthy and/or 
noninfectious patients) is described

 in the Supplemental Information 
(Supplemental Fig 9, Supplemental 
Table 9). Review of the 529 medical 
case records in which the clinician 
noted suspicion of acute infection 
led to exclusion of 100 patients 
who failed to meet 1 or more of 
the infectious inclusion criteria 
(Fig 1, Supplemental Table 6): 46 
had infection with fever below the 
38°C threshold; 41 had symptoms 
for more than 7 days; and 21 were 
younger than 3 months. A further 
68 patients were excluded because 
their samples contained insufficient 
volume to run the host-signature 
assay. The resulting infectious 
cohort on which the index test was 
performed totaled 361 participants. 
Application of the majority panel 
reference standard resulted in 
bacterial or viral reference standard 
diagnoses for 307 of the study 
population (85%). Specifically, there 
were 239 viral (66%), 68 bacterial 
(19%), and 54 (15%) indeterminate 
reference standard outcomes  
(Fig 1).
The infectious cohort was sex-
balanced, with an average age 
of 4.1 years and a wide range of 
temperatures, times from symptom 
onset, and clinical syndromes (Table 1).
Performance of the host-signature 
assay
The levels of TRAIL and IP-10 were 
significantly higher in children with 
viral as compared with bacterial 
infections: mean (SD) levels of TRAIL 
were 139 (122) versus 52 (27) pg/mL  
(P < .001); and IP-10 levels were 
1011 (626) versus 845 (677) pg/mL  
(P < .03), in agreement with 
previous studies.23, 
 
24 CRP exhibited 
the opposite pattern, with mean 
levels significantly lower in children 
with a viral infection as compared 
with a bacterial infection: 31 (32) 
versus 165 (108) mg/L (P < .001). 
The host-signature assay exhibited 
the most pronounced differential (P < 
.001), with a mean viral patient score 
of 20 (24) versus 85 (23) in bacterial 
patients (Fig 2).
Of the 361 patients in the infectious 
cohort, the host-signature assay 
classified 209 patients (58%) with 
a viral outcome (0 ≤ score < 35), 
99 patients (27%) with a bacterial 
outcome (65 < score ≤ 100), and the 
remaining 53 patients (15%) with 
an equivocal outcome (35 ≤ score ≤ 
65) (Fig 1). Primary analysis of the

subgroup Performance analysis
The host-signature assay 
yielded robust sensitivity and 
specificity across a wide range 
of patient subgroups, including 
age and clinical syndrome (Table 
4, Supplemental Table 8). It 
performed comparably irrespective 
of time from symptom onset 
(sensitivity: P = .61; specificity: 
P = .63). The Swiss and Israeli 
subcohorts yielded comparable 
sensitivity, with higher specificity 
demonstrated for the Swiss cohort 
(P < .001). There was no significant 
difference in sensitivity and 
specificity between the subgroup 
that received antibiotics (≤48 hours 
of treatment) and the entire  
cohort (P = 0.99 and 0.39, 
respectively).
In the secondary analysis, 2 
alternative approaches to assigning 
reference standard outcomes were 
applied: unanimous expert panel 
and microbiological confirmation 
(see Methods). A unanimous expert 
diagnosis (3 out of 3) of a bacterial 
or viral infection was observed in 
68% of the cases, and microbiological 
confirmation was observed in 29% of 
cases. As anticipated, the increase in 
reference standard stringency led to 
higher assay accuracy: sensitivity of 
96.2% (90.9%–100%) and specificity 
of 93.3% (89.4%–97.2%) in the 
unanimous subcohort and sensitivity 
of 96.0% (87.7%–100%) and 
specificity of 98.6% (96.0%–100%) 
in the microbiologically confirmed 
subcohort (Fig 4).
assay Results in children With 
indeterminate Reference standard
Of the 361 children in the infectious 
cohort, there were 54 children 
(15%) with indeterminate etiology 
as defined by the application of the 
majority panel reference standard. Of 
the 54 children, there was no expert 
panel majority for 38, that is, each 
panel member assigned a different 
diagnosis; and 14 patients were given 
an indeterminate outcome, that is, at 
least 2 of 3 panel members assigned 
the diagnosis as indeterminate. Two 
of the cases are those reassigned as 
reference indeterminate (Fig 1). No 
significant differences were found in 
the age, sex, maximal temperature, 
time from symptom onset, and 
hospital admission or hospitalization 
duration for this indeterminate 
subgroup in comparison with 
the patients with bacterial/viral 
reference standard outcomes (Table 
5). The proportion of patients who 
received antibiotics was significantly 
larger in the indeterminate subgroup 
(P = .04).
In the absence of reference 
standard outcomes, it is not 
possible to directly evaluate the 
accuracy of the host-signature assay 
for the indeterminate subgroup. 
However, it is of interest to examine 
the distribution of assay scores 
for children with indeterminate 
reference standard outcomes  
(Fig 5). In 31% of those children, 
the assay outcome classification 
was bacterial; in 38% of children, it 
was viral; and in 31% of children, 
it was equivocal (Fig 1). This 
proportion of equivocal assay 
outcome classifications was higher 
than that observed in patients with 
bacterial/viral reference standard 
outcomes (P < .001). Of note, in 
33.3% of the children with an 
indeterminate reference standard 
outcome, the assay outcome was 
classified with a high degree of 
confidence, 
23 that is, the bacterial/
viral likelihood score was <10 
(high likelihood viral) or >90 (high 
likelihood bacterial).
discussion
The current study is the first 
double-blind, investigator-driven 
validation study in febrile children 
≥3 months and ≤18 years old of a 
novel assay comprising the host-
proteins TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP for 
distinguishing between bacterial 
and viral etiologies. In line with the 
authors of previous reports, 
23 
– 
25 
we independently confirm that the 
assay is highly accurate (sensitivity 
of 93.8% [95% CI: 87.8%–99.8%] 
and specificity 89.8% [85.6%–
94.0%]) and that it outperforms 
routine laboratory parameters 
and biomarkers (white blood cell 
count, absolute neutrophil count, 
CRP, PCT, and their combinations), 
significantly reducing both false-
negatives (potentially reducing 
missed bacterial infections) and 
false-positives (potentially reducing 
antibiotic overuse), with an 
equivocal assay outcome in under 
12% of cases. Moreover, subgroup 
analysis supports that the assay

 exhibits consistent performance 
across a wide range of ages, time 
from symptom onset, and clinical 
syndromes.
The robustness of the host-
signature is likely explained by the 
distinctive and complementary 
viral- and bacterial-induced 
expression dynamics of the 3 
constituent host proteins, as 
observed previously, 
23 
– 
25 which 
may reflect their nonredundant 
participation in the network of 
immune responses to infection.40– 
42 
Moreover, from these data, we can 
confirm the previously observed 
unique dynamics of TRAIL, whereby 
it is induced in response to a 
wide range of viral infections and 
significantly reduced in bacterial 
infections.23, 
 
24, 
 
43
Notably, among the indeterminate-
diagnosis patients without a 
reference standard, the assay gave 
a bacterial or viral outcome for 
69% of the cases (the rest were 
equivocal), with half of these 
yielding a score associated with a 
particularly high degree of  
assay diagnostic confidence. This 
finding suggests that the assay 
may be applicable to “harder to 
diagnose” cases in real-life clinical 
settings.
A key strength of this study is 
the double-blinded design, as 
this ensured that the principal 
investigator and the expert 
panel were not influenced by the 
assay result and that the assay 
performer was not biased by the 
reference standard diagnosis. 
Another strength is the diversity 
of recruitment settings (secondary 
and tertiary) and geography (Israel 
and Switzerland) of the study 
population. It is noteworthy that 
the majority of Swiss patients 
(∼70%) presenting to the ED are 
not referrals and, therefore, are 
representative of what might 
be seen in a community setting, 
whereas the majority of Israeli 
patients (∼70%) are referred to the 
ED by a community clinician. This 
demographic difference between 
the 2 countries, and the broader 
spectrum of microbiological tests 
performed on the Swiss patients, 
may explain the observed higher 
specificity of the assay in the Swiss 
subcohort.
Typically, studies evaluating such 
diagnostic tests exclude patients 
who have received antibiotics 
before patient recruitment. 
Therefore, another strength of the 
current study design is that receipt 
of antibiotics for up to 48 hours 
was not an exclusion criterion, as 
these cases are routinely observed 
in the real clinical setting and 
their inclusion enhances the

Diagnostic performance of host-signature assay compared with routine laboratory parameters and other biomarkers (for patients with suspicion of 
acute infection). Diagnostic performance was evaluated by comparing the reference standard outcome (according to expert panel majority) with the 
outcome classified by the host-signature assay or by other parameters or biomarkers. Predefined cutoffs were applied. The assay was run on 307 patients 
(68 bacterial and 239 viral; 11.7% had an equivocal result). ANC and WBC testing were performed on 292 patients (66 bacterial and 226 viral), PCT testing 
was performed on 274 patients (65 bacterial and 209 viral); and CRP testing was performed on 307 patients (68 bacterial and 239 viral). ANC, absolute

 generalizability of the study  
results.
An inherent limitation of this 
study, and all studies evaluating 
tests for distinguishing between 
bacterial and viral infections, 
is the general lack of objective 
clinical criteria that can be used 
to reliably discriminate between 
these etiologies, which constrains 
the ability to ascertain “true” and 
“false” index test outcomes. Often, 
a microbiologically confirmed 
approach is employed for 
determining the reference  
standard, 
14 
– 
16, 
 
44 which has the 
advantage of creating a well-
established and reproducible 
diagnosis. Disadvantages of this 
approach, however, are that 
microbiological confirmation of 
etiology is only obtained in a  
small proportion of cases, and 
there is an enrichment of the study 
cohort with “easier to diagnose” 
cases, resulting in overly optimistic 
diagnostic performance.28, 
 
45 
To address this challenge, we 
applied 3 approaches for assigning 
the reference standard with 
increasing levels of stringency: 
majority adjudication, unanimous 
adjudication, and microbiologically 
confirmed. The assay performance 
in the real-life clinical setting is 
probably higher than the values 
we obtained by using the majority 
adjudication approach but 
lower than the microbiologically 
confirmed approach. We therefore 
performed the primary analysis 
on the former to ensure more 
conservative estimates.
Two further limitations also relate 
to the reference standard. First, 
microbiological polymerase chain 
reaction analysis of nasal swabs 
to detect common respiratory 
viral and bacterial pathogens, 
which can improve the reference 
standard, was only available for 
some patients, and this should be 
addressed in the design of future 
studies. Secondly, although the

 panel was blinded to the host-
signature score, the experts were 
provided with CRP values, because 
CRP is routinely used to help 
differentiate between bacterial  
and viral infections46 and masking 
of this information may reduce  
the quality of the reference 
standard. Provision of the CRP 
value to the expert panel might 
introduce a potential incorporation 
bias, but it is noteworthy that 
the signature significantly 
outperformed CRP.
The population in this study was 
constrained by the availability 
of patient samples. Additionally, 
future studies should seek to 
replicate the results in other 
pediatric populations, including the 
developing world, where there is a 
need for reliable tests to aid in the 
diagnosis of pediatric nonmalarial 
febrile illness, particularly 
tests that take into account 
different comorbidities, such as 
malnutrition.47
The assay evaluated in the study 
has a 2-hour analytical time and 
requires a trained laboratory 
technician, which precludes its wide 
use in the outpatient setting, where 
much antibiotic overuse occurs. 
Development of more rapid (within 
minutes) and easy-to-use formats of 
the assay for the ED and point of care 
would be valuable and is underway.
