Aims
There have been substantial declines in cerebrovascular disease mortality across much of Europe, mirroring trends
in deaths from cardiovascular disease as a whole. No study has investigated trends in cerebrovascular disease, and
its subtypes within all European countries. This study aimed to examine sex-specific trends in cerebrovascular dis-
ease, and three of its sub-types: ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, and subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), in
Europe between 1980 and 2016.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
Sex-specific mortality data for each country of the World Health Organization (WHO) Europe region were extracted
from the WHO global mortality database and analysed using Joinpoint software to examine trends. The number and lo-
cation of significant joinpoints for each country by sex and subtype was determined using a log-linear model. The annual
percentage change within each segment was calculated along with the average annual percentage change over the dur-
ation of all available data. The last 35years have seen large overall declines in cerebrovascular disease mortality rates in
the majority of European countries. While these declines have continued steadily in more than half of countries, this ana-
lysis has revealed evidence of recent plateauing and even increases in stroke mortality in a number of countries, in both
sexes, and in all four geographical sub-regions of Europe. Analysis by stroke sub-type revealed that recent plateauing was
most common for haemorraghic stroke and increases were most common for ischaemic stroke.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
These findings highlight the need for continued research into the inequalities in both current stroke mortality out-
comes and trends across Europe, as well as the causes behind any recent plateauing of total cerebrovascular dis-
ease or its subtypes.

Introduction
In recent decades, there have been substantial declines in cerebrovas-
cular disease mortality across much of Europe, mirroring broader
trends in deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD) as a whole.1
These declines have been attributed to reduced disease incidence
following improvements in primary prevention and risk factor
management combined with improvements in treatment and care,
leading to reduced case-fatality.2 Despite these decreases, cerebro-
vascular diseases remain the second largest single cause of death in
Europe after ischaemic heart disease, responsible for 9% and 13% of
all deaths in men and women, respectively.1 Moreover, recent up-
ward trends in the prevalence of known risk factors such as obesity
and diabetes, as well as plateauing population blood pressure levels,1

raise concerns about possible slow-downs or reversals in cerebro-
vascular disease mortality progress seen so far.
Evidence of recent plateauing in coronary heart disease (CHD)
mortality rates has been demonstrated in at least one age group in 15
European Union (EU) countries for men and 12 countries for women
in an analysis from 1980 to 2009.3 A recent analysis of trends in cere-
brovascular disease mortality in the EU also revealed recent plateaus
or increases in mortality in eight countries among males and seven
among females.4 Existing trend studies of CVDs have tended to focus
on broad categories of disease and have been restricted to EU mem-
ber states.3,4 This study aims to examine the evidence for recent pla-
teauing in sex-specific trends in cerebrovascular disease as a whole,
and also for three cerebrovascular disease sub-types—ischaemic
stroke,
haemorrhagic
stroke,
and
subarachnoid
haemorrhage
(SAH)—in Europe between 1980 and 2016.
Methods
We extracted data on cause-specific mortality and population size by sex
in 5-year age groups (up to and including 85 and over) from the World
Health Organization (WHO) global mortality database for individual
countries of the WHO European region (EUR). These data have been
used widely in the analysis of CVD deaths within Europe1,3,5–9 including
more specifically on stroke,1,4,5,9 as well as being used in analyses of mor-
tality from other conditions within the continent.10–12 On top of this,
WHO mortality data have been used in the analysis of mortality on a glo-
bal level.13–15 The WHO database collates data on the absolute number
of medically certified deaths from national authorities based on their vital
registration systems. The data presented in the WHO Mortality
Database are as submitted by individual countries to WHO.1,5,8 All analy-
ses, interpretations, and conclusions are those of the authors, not the
WHO, which is responsible only for the provision of the original data.
We (R.S., E.W. and N.T.) extracted data on the number of deaths
from all cerebrovascular diseases, plus three cerebrovascular disease
sub-types: ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, and SAH, defined
according to the following International Classification of Disease (ICD)
codes: ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, tenth version)
codes I60-I69 and ICD 9 codes 430-438, ICD 10 mortality tabulation list
1 codes 1069 and ICD 9A/9B, ICD 9N codes B290-B299 and ICD 08A
codes A085. We computed age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs)
for each country, by sex, by standardizing aggregate rates to the
European Standard Population (ESP), using the direct method.
We extracted and analysed data for the years 1980 (or the establish-
ment of the present day country if later) to 2016 (or the most recently
available year). The availability of data varied by country. Moreover, over
the period studied, death registration or population data were missing for
some years in some countries. We obtained deaths in Germany for the
years prior to 1990 by combining death registration and population data
for the former Democratic Republic of Germany and the former Federal
Republic of Germany, then calculated overall rates. We analysed England,
Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland together as the UK.
We performed Joinpoint regression analysis to identify periods with
statistically distinct log linear trends in death rates from all cerebrovascu-
lar diseases and cerebrovascular disease sub-types over time within each
sex and country. This analysis identifies inflexion points (or ‘joinpoints’) at
which there is a significant change in trends using a series of permutation
tests, with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons. We set the
two-sided significance level at P < 0.05 for all tests. We determined the
number and location of significant joinpoints for each country by sex
using a log-linear model, and computed the annual percentage change
(APC) within each segment. Use of a log-linear model enables the analysis
of constant percentage (rather than absolute) change in the prevalence
over time. We defined evidence to suggest a recent plateau in the mortal-
ity trend as the situation where the final joinpoint segment (in the best fit-
ted model) was less steeply negative compared with the preceding
segment. A negative slope was defined as one in which the APC was sig-
nificantly negative, conferring a decreasing trend. A flat slope was defined
as one in which the APC was not significantly different to zero. We
defined evidence to suggest an increase in mortality as the situation
where the APC was significantly positive, conferring an increasing trend.
We also calculated the average annual percentage change (AAPC) for
the overall period (1980–2016) for each country by sex. All definitions
were designed a priori to agree with previous studies.3,16
We analysed trends by European geographical region, using the
categories of Western Europe, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and
Central Asia, as defined by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD)
study.4,17 All countries of WHO Europe fitted this categorisation,
with the exception of Turkey that was found in the Middle East and
North Africa region by GBD classification. We conducted all analyses
using JoinPoint regression program version 4.4.0 (Statistical research
and applications branch, National Cancer institute, USA). JoinPoint
regression Program enables the user to test whether or not an appar-
ent change in trend is statistically significant, by testing whether a
multi-segmented line is a significantly better fit than a straight or less-
segmented line. Line segments are joined at inflexion points called
joinpoints. Each joinpoint denotes a statistically significant (P < 0.05)
change in trend. Joinpoint fits the selected trend data into the simplest
joinpoint model that the data allow. Since an additional joinpoint is
only added to the model if the change in trend is statistically signifi-
cant, each of the joinpoints displayed from the chosen model can be
interpreted as a significant change in the trend. Once the line seg-
ments are established, the estimated annual percent change is used to
describe and test the statistical significance of the trends in the model.
Testing the hypothesis (two-sided P-value <0.05) that the annual per-
cent change is equal to zero is equivalent to testing the hypothesis
that the trend in the mortality rates is neither increasing nor decreas-
ing.18,19 The JoinPoint regression programme has been used exten-
sively in previous research on trends in CVD6,16,20–23 including
cerebrovascular disease.4,9 We used Microsoft Excel 2016 for data
management and manipulation, including the calculation of ASMRs,
and as a data input file for JoinPoint.
Results
Supplementary material online, Table S1 provides an overview of the
available years of data, the population size, and total number of
deaths and stroke deaths by sex in 2016 (or the most recent year
available) for 51 of the 53 countries of the European region. No data
were available for Andorra or Monaco. Complete data for all 37
study years were available for five countries for all cerebrovascular
diseases. Turkey had the lowest data availability, with available data
from only 2009–2013 (5 years), followed by San Marino where data
were available for 1995–2000 and 2005 (7 years).
In the latest available year, the number of stroke deaths was higher
in females than males in 50 of the 51 countries with available data.
The exception was Kyrgyzstan. The percentage of all deaths due to
stroke was higher in females than males in all countries. However,
ASMRs from stroke, which control for differences in population size
and population age structure, were higher in males than females in all
countries.

On average, the percentage of total deaths due to stroke in the lat-
est available year was lowest in Western Europe (5.9% in males, 8.2%
in females) and highest in Eastern Europe (11.6% in males, 17.5% in
females). The lowest ASMRs for stroke were also found in Western
Europe and the highest in Eastern Europe. In males, the ASMR for
stroke ranged from 49 per 100 000 population in France to 131 in
San Marino among Western European countries, from 110 in the
Czech Republic to 391 in Bulgaria among Central European coun-
tries, from 82 in Estonia to 331 in Russia in Eastern European coun-
tries, and from 152 in Armenia to 345 in Azerbaijan in Central Asia. In
females, the ASMR for stroke ranged from 41 in France to 112 in
Greece among Western European countries, from 87 in Slovenia to
301 in Bulgaria among Central European countries, from 55/100 000
in Estonia to 253 in Moldova in Eastern European countries, and from
142 in Armenia to 342 in Azerbaijan in Central Asia (see
Supplementary material online, Table S1).
Average annual percentage changes:
overall trends in mortality
Supplementary material online, Tables S2–S5 summarize the AAPCs
for mortality from all cerebrovascular diseases and three cerebrovas-
cular disease sub-types: ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, and
SAH by sex. For cerebrovascular disease as a whole, significant
decreases in ASMRs over the available years between 1980 and 2016
were seen in 34 countries among males (67%) and 34 countries
among females (67%). The proportion of countries experiencing a
significant decrease in cerebrovascular disease mortality was greatest
in Western Europe in both males (96%) and females (91%). Among
males, the smallest proportion of countries with a significant decrease
was found in Central Asia (25%), whilst 62% of countries in Central
Europe, and 43% of countries in Eastern Europe experienced signifi-
cant declines. Among females, Central Asia had the smallest propor-
tion of countries with a significant decrease (13%), compared with
57% in Eastern Europe and 69% in Central Europe.
The median AAPC (covering the full 37 year period) for all cere-
brovascular diseases across all countries was -2.7% for males and
-2.7% for females. In both sexes, the median AAPC was most nega-
tive in Western Europe (-3.6% for males, -3.6% for females) and least
negative in Eastern Europe (-0.7%) for males, and in Central Asia for
females (-0.9%). AAPCs in males in Central Asia (-1.0%) and Central
Europe (-0.9%) were similar. In females the median AAPC in Central
Europe (-1.7%) was more negative than for Eastern Europe (-1.0%).
Despite these broad regional differences, the largest decreases
occurred in countries spanning different regions: Austria, the Czech
Republic,
Estonia,
Luxembourg,
Montenegro,
Portugal
and
Turkmenistan (AAPCs <
_-4.5% for both sexes). Males in Macedonia
were the only to show a significant increase over the period of study
(0.6%). However, the largest positive AAPCs amongst both males
(9.7%) and females (3.3%) were found in San Marino over the seven
data points available for the country, although neither were signifi-
cant. (Figure 1, Supplementary material online, Table S2).
For the three stroke sub-types, data were available for only 43
countries, with most of the countries with missing data found in
Eastern Europe and Central Asia. More than half of countries with
available data experienced significant decreases in mortality from is-
chaemic stroke (56% for males, 51% for females) and haemorrhagic
stroke (58% for males, 67% for females). In contrast, although 56% of
countries showed decreases in ASMRs for SAH in males, only 42%
did so for females. The median decrease for SAH (APC -1.9% for
males, -1.2% for females) was lower than for ischaemic stroke (APC
-2.2% for males, -2.2% for females) and haemorrhagic stroke (APC
-2.0% for males, -2.5% for females), particularly among females (Figure
2, Supplementary material online, Table S3).
The median AAPC was negative in all regions for all three stroke
sub-types, with the exception of ischaemic stroke in Central Asia
(þ4.5% for males, þ3.8% for females) and Central Europe (þ2.4%
for males, þ2.1% for females). The greatest median AAPC decreases
for ischaemic stroke were found in Western Europe in males (-3.9%)
and females (-3.7%). The greatest median decreases in SAH were
found in Eastern Europe amongst males (-2.9%) and in Central Asia
amongst females (-1.9%); the smallest median decreases were found
in Central Europe for both sexes (-1.3% for males, -1.2% for females).
Conversely, for haemorraghic stroke Western Europe showed the
smallest median decreases (-1.5% for males, -2.2% for females) and
Central Asia the greatest median decrease (-4.7% for males, -4.3%
for females). There were significant mortality increases for ischaemic
stroke in Germany, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Poland, Moldova
and Kazakhstan for both males and females, Croatia for males only
and Slovakia and TFYR of Macedonia for females only. No countries
showed a significantly increasing trend for haemorraghic stroke, al-
though a number of countries did for SAH: Romania for both sexes,
Turkey for males only and Luxembourg, Bulgaria and Macedonia for
females only (Figure 3, Supplementary material online, Table S4).
For the vast majority of countries, there was no significant
difference in the AAPC between the sexes, with the exceptions
of Bulgaria, Lithuania and Spain for all cerebrovascular disease;
Estonia, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Serbia and Spain for
haemorraghic stroke and Germany, Netherlands and Spain for
SAH (Figure 4, Supplementary material online, Table S5).
Identifying inflexion points and evidence
for plateaus
For each sex for cerebrovascular disease as a whole, there was a mix-
ture of countries demonstrating continuous linear trends (no join-
points identified) and models containing one to five joinpoints over
30 years of analysis. Seventeen countries, predominantly in Central
and Eastern Europe and Central Asia, had segments of significantly
positive mortality trends in males, females or both sexes. There was
a steeper decrease in the most recent trend segments than in the
previous segment in more than half of countries (65% in both sexes).
However, there was evidence of a recent plateau in mortality trends
(where the rate of mortality decreases in the most recent period was
less pronounced than in the previous period) in seven countries
(14%) among males, and six countries (12%) among females. These
countries spanned Western and Central Europe and included the
Austria, France and Germany for both sexes, Denmark, Greece,
Czech Republic and Hungary for males only, and Belgium, Ireland and
Switzerland for females only. Eight countries (16%) showed a flat
slope, or no significant change in the final segment in males, with ten
countries (20%) doing so for females. There was also evidence of a
recent increase in mortality trends in three countries (6%) for males
(Azerbaijan, Georgia and Tajikistan) and two countries (4%) for

females (Azerbaijan and Tajikistan) (Figure 5, Supplementary material
online, Table 1).
The tendency for increases in mortality was greatest for is-
chaemic stroke with recent increases in eight countries (16%)
for males and nine (18%) countries for females. This compared
to five countries (10%) showing an increasing recent trend in
SAH mortality amongst males and eight countries (16%) for
females. Haemorraghic stroke demonstrated fewer increasing
recent trends, with three countries (6%) for males and one
country (2%) for females (Table 1).
Discussion
The last 35 years have seen large overall declines in cerebrovas-
cular disease mortality in the majority of European countries.
While these declines have continued at a steady or increasing
rate in more than half of countries, this analysis has revealed evi-
dence of recent plateauing and even increases in stroke mortal-
ity in a number of individual countries. Recent mortality plateaus
and increases have been observed in both sexes, and in coun-
tries spanning all four geographical sub-regions of Europe,

although significant increases in stroke mortality appear to be
particularly common in Central Asia.
There have also been overall decreases in mortality for three
stroke sub-types over the past 35 years. These decreases have been
greatest for ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke and smaller
for SAH. As with cerebrovascular disease as a whole, recent mortal-
ity plateaus and increases have been seen for these sub-types in sev-
eral geographically diverse individual countries. The tendency for
recent plateauing was greatest for haemorraghic stroke, while recent
increases in mortality were most common for ischaemic. Recent
increases for all cerebrovascular disease also appear to be most com-
mon in Central Asia, and is slightly higher in males than females.
These findings of overall decreases in cerebrovascular disease
mortality with emerging mortality plateaus and increases in several
individual countries are consistent with those of Wang et al. for
stroke,4 and with those of Nichols et al. for CHD.3 Both of these
studies analysed trends up to 2009, whereas this study extends the
analysis period to 2016. This study also analyses trends in Europe as
a whole as opposed to EU member states only, and in doing so, high-
lights the tendency for recent increases in cerebrovascular disease
mortality in Central Asian countries. Moreover, in analysing trends
for stroke sub-types in addition to cerebrovascular disease more
broadly, this study identifies recent mortality increases in ischaemic
stroke as a particular concern.

One possible explanation for the attenuation of stroke mortality
declines in a number of countries relates to plateauing or increases in
stroke risk factors leading to changes in the incidence of the disease.
Particularly noteworthy here are the considerable increases in the
prevalence of overweight/obesity and diabetes over the last 30 years
across Europe, as well as the recent stabilisation of smoking preva-
lence and blood cholesterol levels in many countries after steep
declines.1 Recent decades have also seen limited improvements in
case fatality rates for stroke, which could be another contributing fac-
tor.24 These most likely relate to improvements in treatment, al-
though inequalities of this may exist between European countries.
This analysis has revealed differences in mortality trends across
the three stroke sub-types, with recent plateauing most common
for haemorraghic stroke and mortality increases most common for
ischaemic stroke. Although trends in sub-types may be biased as
data were predominantly missing from countries with higher mor-
tality rates/different trends, these three sub-types have distinct
pathophysiologies, and accordingly, the relative importance of dif-
ferent risk factors varies between them. The aforementioned pla-
teauing in smoking prevalence could partly account for the
different trends, with cigarette smoking a well-established risk fac-
tor for cerebral infarction25–28 and SAH,29 but less clearly so for

intracerebral haemorrhage.26,28,30,31 Moreover, recent plateaus in
mean blood cholesterol levels following sustained declines1 could
play a role: cholesterol levels are positively associated with the risk
of ischaemic stroke and SAH but inversely related to the risk of
haemorrhagic stroke.32 Increased government-supported primary
prevention efforts to tackle these risk factors should be a
priority moving forwards, and will be most effective combined
with improved treatment and long-term support to cover the
whole stroke pathway. These efforts will be especially important in
Central Asian countries, where there is most evidence of mortality
increases.
The WHO mortality and population data are a valuable resource,
permitting large-scale analysis, and cross-national comparisons such
as those in this study. In general, these data are of high quality and are
available for a large number of years for many countries. They have
been used in a large number of studies on mortality within individual
countries, across Europe and globally. That said, data coverage and
quality is variable.
The data presented in the WHO Mortality Database, and in this
article are as submitted by individual countries to WHO. No
adjustments have been made to account for potential bias in
reporting. As a result, the quality of mortality data varies between
countries, with more accurate data for countries with well-
functioning vital registration systems compared with those with
weaker systems.1,5 We undertook no further data quality assess-
ments than those already carried out by the WHO. They define

data usability as the product of the proportion of deaths assigned
to a set of ill-defined (garbage) cause of death codes and 100 less
the percentage of completeness.26 The WHO identified three
countries from our sample as having data of lower usability (i.e.
below 65%): Albania (60%), Georgia (61%), and Turkey (58%).
Four countries were also identified as having a top of range frac-
tion of garbage codes of more than 25% over all the years of data
available: Bulgaria (28%), Greece (27%), Montenegro (29%), and
Poland (31%). A number of countries also reported death regis-
tration data using a summarized cause list: Belarus, Ireland,
Kazakhstan, Portugal, Russian Federation, The former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.26 These data
quality measures apply to a range of data rather than those per-
taining to cerebrovascular disease specifically.33
Age-standardized rates can only be calculated where data on the
absolute number of an outcome and the population are available in
comparable age-specific aggregates. There was a complete absence
of data for Andorra and Monaco (though these countries represent a
small fraction of total European population), eight countries had no
mortality data by stroke sub-type, and for others data were available
for only a limited number of years over the study period. Central
Asian and Eastern European countries were particularly affected,
with sub-type data available for only three and four countries, re-
spectively. This limits the power of the regional comparisons

presented here, and highlights the importance of improved national
stroke surveillance in these regions. There is also inter-country vari-
ability in ICD coding practices. For example, data from the WHO
MONICA project suggest that official mortality statistics in France
underreport CVD deaths compared with other countries, and that
doctors in France are more likely to code CVD deaths as ‘other
causes’, resulting in an underestimate of the true numbers and pro-
portions of deaths from CVD.34 The necessary use in this historical
trends study of three different ICD coding schemes is a further limita-
tion, although more so for the sub-types analysis than the broader
cerebrovascular disease category. As is the large proportion of
stroke mortality that is unspecified and cannot therefore be included
in sub-type analysis.
In addition to issues of data, there are limitations of the joinpoint
approach to analysis. The method used to define a ‘recent plateau’ in
trends provides a general indication at the European level of whether
these is an emerging overall pattern of stabilising trends in stroke
mortality rates. However, it is a simplified approach that may not give
a holistic indication of a ‘recent plateau’ for a small number of sub-
groups or countries. This is particularly true in cases of brief trend
segments. For example, both males and females in Hungary were
classified as having ‘evidence of a recent plateau’ for ischaemic stroke
as the most recent joinpoint segments had an APC of -4.6% and
-4.1% respectively, while the preceding segments had an APC of
-17.7% and -18.9%, respectively. In both cases, however, the penulti-
mate segments only span three years (2003–2006), after which there
has been a consistent annual percentage reduction in mortality rates.
A final limitation of this study is that it only seeks to describe trends
in cerebrovascular mortality and does not aim to explain them. Further
work could look to investigate the association between these mortality
outcomes and sociodemographic characteristics, such as measures of
income and health care expenditure. A weakness of the outcome data
used here and many of these sociodemographic measures, is that they
are collected and reported at the country level. Meaning that any study
using them would prove ecological in nature. A richer dataset, arranged
by regions within countries, would allow a more detailed analysis on
within country and between country inequalities.
Conclusion
Despite overall declines in stroke mortality in Europe over the past
35 years, there is emerging evidence of recent mortality plateaus and
increases in a number of individual countries. Evidence of recent
increases in stroke mortality is most common in Central Asia.
Analysing by stroke sub-type reveals that recent plateauing is most
common for haemorrhagic and increases are most common for is-
chaemic stroke. These findings highlight the need for continued re-
search into the inequalities in both the stroke mortality outcomes
and recent trends across Europe, as well as the causes behind any re-
cent plateauing of total cerebrovascular disease or its subtypes.
Continued monitoring of trends in cerebrovascular disease and sub-
type mortality, incidence, case-fatality, and risk factors across the re-
gion is paramount to ensure interventions are well-targeted, and
should be a priority for future research. Incorporating individual level
data into country level analysis, through hierarchical or multilevel
techniques, would be useful in examining within country trends and
determinants. The collecting and reporting of these types of data
could prove invaluable in the development of public health
approaches to prevent stroke mortality.
