BACKGROUND: Deintensification of diabetic therapy is
often clinically appropriate for older adults, because the
benefit of aggressive diabetes treatment declines with age,
while the risks increase.
OBJECTIVE: We examined rates of overtreatment and
deintensification of therapy for older adults with diabetes,
and whether these rates differed by medical, demograph-
ic, and socioeconomic characteristics.
DESIGN, SUBJECTS, AND MAIN MEASURES: We ana-
lyzed Medicare claims data from 10 states, linked to out-
patient laboratory values to identify patients potentially
overtreated for diabetes (HbA1c < 6.5% with fills for any
diabetes medications beyond metformin, 1/1/2011–6/
30/2011). We examined characteristics associated with
deintensification for potentially overtreated diabetic pa-
tients. We used multinomial logistic regression to examine
whether patient characteristics associated with overtreat-
ment of diabetes differed from those associated with
undertreatment (i.e. HbA1c > 9.0%).
KEY RESULTS: Of 78,792 Medicare recipients with dia-
betes, 8560 (10.9%) were potentially overtreated. Over-
treatment of diabetes was more common among those
who were over 75 years of age and enrolled in Medicaid
(p < 0.001), and was less common among Hispanics
(p = 0.009). Therapy was deintensified for 14% of
overtreated diabetics. Appropriate deintensification of di-
abetic therapy was more common for patients with six or
more chronic conditions, more outpatient visits, or living
in urban areas; deintensification was less common for
those over age 75. Only 6.9% of Medicare recipients with
diabetes were potentially undertreated. Variables associ-
ated with overtreatment of diabetes differed from those
associated with undertreatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Medicare recipients are more frequently
overtreated than undertreated for diabetes. Medicare re-
cipients who are overtreated for diabetes rarely have their
regimens deintensified.

INTRODUCTION
Treating diabetes requires balancing the risks of long-term harm
from undertreatment with the short-term and long-term harm
from potential overtreatment. At times, deintensification of
therapy—removing treatments that were previously
recommended1—is appropriate. The Choosing Wisely cam-
paign, which has been promoted in multiple countries,2–4 focuses
on reducing overtreatment. The American Geriatrics Society
(AGS) specifically states that medications other than metformin
should be avoided when an older patient’s hemoglobin A1c is
less than 7.5%, because the risks of hypoglycemia are increased
and the potential benefits of treatment are decreased for older
adults with diabetes.5, 6 The National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom offers a similar
recommendation,7 as randomized trials have shown that the
benefits of aggressive glycemic control begin only after at least
8 years of treatment,8–11 yet the harms of aggressive glycemic
control—hypoglycemia, cardiovascular events, cognitive impair-
ment, fractures, and death—can happen at any time.12–16 Several
studies have reported that a significant proportion of adults with
diabetes are potentially overtreated.17–23 A United States (US)
Veterans Health Administration study found that only a small
minority of overtreated diabetic patients received medication
deintensification, causing unnecessary exposure to potentially
harmful treatments.19
Prior work has identified a number of disparities in control of
diabetes and its complications.24–28 However, most attention has
focused on undertreatment of diabetes, and investigation of
patient characteristics associated with overtreatment of diabe-
tes20 or severe hypoglycemia21 has been limited. Therefore, we
examined rates of overtreatment and deintensification of therapy
for Medicare beneficiaries, and whether there were any dispar-
ities in these rates by race/ethnicity, dual eligibility, age, sex,

 rurality, or multimorbidity. To put these overtreatment findings
into context, we compared the rates and patient characteristics
associated with overtreatment and undertreatment of diabetes in
the same cohort of patients.
METHODS
Data Source
We used Medicare claims from fee-for-service beneficiaries in 10
eastern US states (NY
, NJ, MD, DE, V
A, NC, SC, GA, FL, AL)
from a data linkage project that has been described previously.29
We accessed the data through the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse
(CCW) Virtual Research Data Center. The data included Medi-
care Part D files, carrier Standard Analytic Files, Chronic Con-
ditions Data Warehouse (CCW) summary files, and the corre-
sponding denominator files from 2010 to 2011. The Medicare
Part D files contain brand and generic prescription drug names,
strength, days’ supply, quantity dispensed, and service date. The
carrier files contain noninstitutional provider claims for services
covered under Medicare Part B, including International Classifi-
cation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-
9-CM) diagnosis codes, place of service, Current Procedural
Terminology codes, and dates of service. Medicare claims for
laboratory services were linked to actual outpatient laboratory
values processed by a national laboratory vendor in 2011 for
Medicare beneficiaries. The CCW summary file provides flags
for 27 chronic diseases based on diagnoses in Parts A and B
Medicare claims from 1999 onward.30 Denominator files include
patient demographic characteristics, birth and death dates, and
information about program eligibility and enrollment.
Study Cohort
We included older adults who met all the following criteria:
enrolled in Medicare Parts A, B, and D between January 1,
2010, and December 30, 2011; had a diagnosis of diabetes in
the CCW summary file in the 2 years before June 30, 2010; had
at least one HbA1c lab result available between January 1, 2011,
and June 30, 2011, and were 65 years or older at this HbA1c
date; and were alive on December 31, 2011 (eFigure 1). If
multiple HbA1c lab results existed for a patient, the first HbA1c
lab was selected for analysis, and defined as the index date.
Medications
Diabetes medications were identified in the Medicare Part D files
by searching, from 120 days before to 180 days after the index
date, generic drug names for the following classes of medica-
tions: insulin, biguanides, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones,
meglitinides, GLP-1 agonists, amylin analogs, DPP-4 inhibitors,
and alpha-glycosidase inhibitors (see Appendix Table 5 for
details). For patients on combination medications, we counted
each component as a separate medication. Daily dose was cal-
culated using medication strength, days’ supply, and quantity
dispensed19 for all oral agents.
Outcomes
Patients were classified as potentially overtreated for diabetes
if they had an index HbA1c value of less than 6.5% during the
period from January through June 2011 and had filled any
diabetes medications other than metformin in a pre-index
medication regimen during the months leading up to this index
HbA1c value. We chose this HbA1c threshold because it was
substantially lower than the Choosing Wisely and AGS5 rec-
ommendations to avoid medications other than metformin
when HbA1c values were less than 7.5%,31 and lower than
the American Diabetes Association’s guidelines for glucose
control for patients with diabetes.32 Patients were classified as
potentially undertreated if their index HbA1c was greater than
9.0%, regardless of medication status, consistent with
Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS)
measures since 1999.33 All others were classified as having
acceptable treatment of their diabetes.
We defined medication deintensification among potentially
overtreated older adults using a previously published meth-
od.19 Briefly, older adults on oral agents were defined as
having had their regimens deintensified if they had medication
fills with a lower dose than the index dose in the 1 to 180 days
after the index date, or no refills of previously prescribed
medications in the 22 to 180 days after the index date (see
eFigure 1 in Sussman19 for an illustration). The index dose
was defined as the medication dosage in the months leading up
to the index HbA1c value used to define overtreatment,
undertreatment, or neither. Medications filled in the 1–21 days
after the date of the index dose were ignored for defining
deintensification. We did this to account for blood draws or
other visit-related work that occurs after the visit. Since
HbA1c measurements are rarely repeated in under 3 months,
this is unlikely to create any biases. Following prior work,19
older adults on insulin, pramlintide, or exenatide were defined
as having deintensification if there were no medication refills
in the 22 to 180 days after the index date. As the focus of this
study was overtreatment and deintensification of therapy, we
did not examine intensification of therapy for undertreated
older adults, as many previous studies have examined this
question.34
Study Variables
Covariates of interest obtained from the Medicare denomina-
tor files included baseline patient demographic characteristics,
specifically age (65–70, 71–75, 76+), race/ethnicity (non-His-
panic white, Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, other),23 Medicaid
dual eligibility, indication for Medicare eligibility (age vs.
disability), gender, and urban location.35, 36 We derived urban
location from rural-urban commuting area codes based on ZIP
Code of residence. The number of chronic conditions (0–1, 2–
3, 4–5, 6+) was constructed from the CCW chronic disease
flags at end of year for 18 conditions (see Appendix Table 6
for details). From carrier physician claims, we obtained the
number of outpatient visits for evaluation and management
(E&M) visits in 2010 based on Healthcare Common Proce-
dure Coding System codes 992.xx, 993.xx, and 994.xx.

 Statistical Analysis
The associations between diabetes overtreatment and covariates
of interest were summarized using means and standard devia-
tions for continuous variables and frequencies with percentages
for categorical variables. We compared rates of overtreatment to
undertreatment and adequate treatment by groups, using χ2 tests
for categorical variables and Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous
variables. To assess the association between patient characteris-
tics and three-level treatment outcome, we used a multinomial
logistic regression with the reference category as adequate treat-
ment that adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, Medicaid dual eligi-
bility, indication for Medicare eligibility (age vs. disability),
gender, multimorbidity, number of outpatient visits, and urban
location (Table 1).35, 36 To account for multiple comparisons, we
report 99% confidence intervals and used a two-tailed α = 0.01
to establish the statistical significance of tests for all analyses.
Among potentially overtreated individuals, we examined
variables associated with treatment deintensification using
means and standard deviations for continuous variables and
frequencies with percentages for categorical variables. To test
for differences between those who did and did not receive
deintensification of treatment, we used χ2 tests for categorical
variables and Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables. We
then examined whether deintensification differed based on
race/ethnicity, dual eligibility, older age, sex, rurality (urban/
rural), or multimorbidity, using multivariable logistic regres-
sion. Results are presented in both tabular and graphical form.
The institutional review board of the Duke University Health
System approved the study, and analyses were performed using
SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
RESULTS
We identified 78,972 older adults who had been diagnosed with
diabetes and met the inclusion criteria (Appendix figure 1), of
whom 10.8% (n = 8560) were potentially overtreated and 6.9%
(n = 5487) were potentially undertreated for diabetes. Over-
treatment was more prevalent than undertreatment in all sub-
groups examined except those with one or fewer comorbidity
(Table 2). Rates of overtreatment were highest among those
who were dual eligible for Medicaid (13.4%) and those over
75 years of age (12.1%), and ranged from 11.1% for non-
Hispanic blacks to 9.6% for those of Bother^ race/ethnicity.
After adjustment, overtreatment remained more likely for
those dually enrolled in Medicaid and those over 75 years of
age, while overtreatment was less likely for Hispanic benefi-
ciaries and those in urban areas (Table 2). The variables
associated with overtreatment of diabetes differed consider-
ably from those associated with undertreatment (Table 2).

 Of the 8560 older adults who were potentially overtreated
(Table 3), 13.9% (n = 1187 of 8560) received treatment
deintensification within 180 days following the index HbA1c.
Rates of deintensification were highest for adults aged 65–70
(15.1%) and Hispanic patients (Table 4). Treatment
deintensification increased with the number of chronic conditions.
In adjusted analysis, deintensification of diabetes therapy
was more likely for those with 6 or more chronic conditions
(adj. OR = 1.57, 99% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13–2.16), in
urban areas (adj. OR = 1.17, 99% CI: 1.01–1.36) or with more
outpatient visits (adj. OR = 1.04, 99% CI: 1.00–1.08).
Deintensification was less likely for those over 75 years of
age (adj. OR = 0.78, 99% CI: 0.67–0.90).
DISCUSSION
We found that overtreatment was more common than
undertreatment of diabetes for Medicare beneficiaries in
2011. Among those overtreated, only about 14% received
treatment deintensification, which is lower than rates of
deintensification reported in prior studies of veterans in
201219 and privately insured individuals in 2013.21 As the
AGS began recommending less aggressive treatment of dia-
betes in 2013, current rates of overtreatment may be somewhat
lower than what we report here.
We found that overtreatment of diabetes for Medicare pa-
tients was associated with age over 75 and Hispanic
race/ethnicity, which is consistent with prior studies of over-
treatment of diabetes.20, 21 Interestingly, older adults dually
enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare were both more likely to
be overtreated and more likely to be undertreated for diabetes
than individuals without dual enrollment, possibly because this
is a very heterogeneous group with highly variable diabetes
control and a greater diversity of comorbid conditions. Future
work is needed to determine whether there are distinct sub-
groups of dual-eligible individuals with diabetes who might
benefit from specific approaches to diabetes management.

 We found deintensification of diabetes therapy to be more
common for Medicare beneficiaries with six or more chronic
conditions, more outpatient visits, or living in urban areas, and
less likely for those over age 75. It is troubling that the oldest
Medicare beneficiaries were more likely to be overtreated and less
likely to have their medication regimens deintensified, because
these older adults are least likely to benefit from tight glycemic
control and most likely to be harmed. It is encouraging that those
with multiple chronic conditions were more likely to receive
deintensification, because they often have complex medication
regimens, andprior studieshave shown that riskfor hypoglycemia
increases with age, comorbidity burden, and polypharmacy.13
Despite the relative lack of patient characteristics associated
with overtreatment and deintensification, we found substantial
disparities in potential undertreatment of diabetes among Medi-
care beneficiaries, consistent with previous findings.24–28 These
disparities have long plagued American healthcare. This is the
first study to examine overtreatment and deintensification in a
Medicare population and to examine rates of potential overtreat-
ment and undertreatment in the same cohort. Nonetheless, several
limitations must be acknowledged. First, we were unable to
separately examine age-eligible and disability-eligible older
adults, since all adults were 65 years of age or older. Second,
we stratified older adults by demographic characteristics and
comorbidity burden, but did not stratify them by health status
defined by activities of daily living18 or by life expectancy19 as in
prior work. Similarly, we did not examine subgroup differences
via interaction terms, which would merit consideration in future
work with larger samples. Third, the reasons for a lack of
deintensification among those potentially overtreated for diabetes
are unknown. It is possible that clinicians did not recommended
a change in regimen, and it is also possible that
deintensification was recommended but patients preferred to
remain on their existing regimen. Fourth, glycemic control
was based upon a single cross-sectional measurement in
2011, so it is unknown whether older adults’ control was stable
or changing prior to the index value we studied. Fifth, the
results may not generalize to older adults outside of these 10
eastern states or those enrolled in Medicare Advantage. Final-
ly, we were not able to examine whether potential overtreat-
ment or lack of deintensification was associated with clinically
relevant adverse outcomes.
Optimizing glucose control is clinically difficult, but it is a
public health imperative. Major trials have shown that aggres-
sive diabetes control has both significant benefits for younger,
healthy patients and substantial risks for older patients and
those with comorbidities.8–11 Recent clinical practice guide-
lines acknowledge that these risks must be addressed for older
adults in particular.5, 7, 37 However, this guidance was not
universal in 2011. Therefore, our findings on the prevalence
of overtreatment of Medicare beneficiaries in 2011 may in part
reflect the fact that clinicians had not adapted to recent clinical
guidelines for diabetes management that relaxed glycemic
control targets for older adults with multiple chronic condi-
tions, limited life expectancy, diabetic complications, or func-
tional impairment.5 Future studies should examine whether
rates of overtreatment and deintensification of diabetes regi-
mens have changed over the last 6 years, and whether the
disparities observed here have narrowed.
The management of diabetes in the presence of comorbidities
must also be carefully considered, because comorbidity may alter
medication choices. Guidelines from the American Diabetes
Association have long recommended less intensive treatment
for people with Bimportant comorbidities,^ and modeling studies
have long shown that factors in addition to HbA1c should
influence the overall net benefit of intensive treatment.38 How-
ever, this study and other work in different settings and countries
has shown that comorbidity has a minimal impact on diabetes
treatment intensity as measured by the A1c achieved. Additional
work is needed to understand whether deintensification of dia-
betic therapy affects older adults differently depending on their
number of comorbid conditions, because so little is yet known in
this emerging area of research and clinical practice.
For decades, diabetes guidelines and performance measures
have focused only on reducing the undertreatment of diabetes.
Even now, while guidelines mention more relaxed HbA1c
targets for appropriate patients, there are no algorithms for
deintensifying treatments. The focus on undertreatment has
resulted in dramatic improvements in glycemic control, on
average, but has apparently also encouraged overtreatment.
In the current era, effective treatment of diabetes requires a
major shift in approach toward greater personalization of
treatment based on individual potential risk and benefit. Our
study points the way for identifying not only those patients
who may benefit from more intensive treatment, but also those
who may need deintensification. By focusing at both the
overtreatment and undertreatment ends of the diabetes quality
spectrum, we can best begin to truly improve the quality of
diabetes care, ensuring that patients get needed care while
avoiding unnecessary potential harm.
