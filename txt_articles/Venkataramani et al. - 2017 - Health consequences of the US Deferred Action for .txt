Health consequences of the US Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration programme: 
a quasi-experimental study
Atheendar S Venkataramani, Sachin J Shah, Rourke O’Brien, Ichiro Kawachi, Alexander C Tsai
Summary
Background The effects of changes in immigration policy on health outcomes among undocumented immigrants are 
not well known. We aimed to examine the physical and mental health effects of the Deferred Action for Childhood 
Arrivals (DACA) programme, a 2012 US immigration policy that provided renewable work permits and freedom from 
deportation for a large number of undocumented immigrants.
Methods We did a retrospective, quasi-experimental study using nationally representative, repeated cross-sectional 
data from the US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for the period January, 2008, to December, 2015. We 
included non-citizen, Hispanic adults aged 19–50 years in our analyses. We used a difference-in-differences strategy to 
compare changes in health outcomes among individuals who met key DACA eligibility criteria (based on age at 
immigration and at the time of policy implementation) before and after programme implementation versus changes 
in outcomes for individuals who did not meet these criteria. We additionally restricted the sample to individuals who 
had lived in the USA for at least 5 years and had completed high school or its equivalent, in order to hold fixed two 
other DACA eligibility criteria. Our primary outcomes were self-reported overall health (measured on a 5 point Likert 
scale) and psychological distress (Kessler 6 [K6] scale), the latter was administered to a random subset of NHIS 
respondents.
Findings Our final sample contained 14 973 respondents for the self-reported health outcome and 5035 respondents for 
the K6 outcome. Of these individuals, 3972 in the self-reported health analysis and 1138 in the K6 analysis met the DACA 
eligibility criteria. Compared with people ineligible for DACA, the introduction of DACA was associated with no 
significant change among DACA-eligible individuals in terms of self-reported overall health (b=0·056, 95% CI 
–0·024 to 0·14, p=0·17) or the likelihood of reporting poor or fair health (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·98, 95% CI 
0·66–1·44, p=0·91). However, DACA-eligible individuals experienced a reduction in K6 score compared with DACA-
ineligible individuals (adjusted incident risk ratio 0·78, 95% CI 0·56–0·95, p=0·020) and were less likely to meet 
screening criteria for moderate or worse psychological distress (aOR 0·62, 95% CI 0·41–0·93, p=0·022).
Interpretation Economic opportunities and protection from deportation for undocumented immigrants, as offered 
by DACA, could confer large mental health benefits to such individuals. Health consequences should be considered 
by researchers and policy makers in evaluations of the broader welfare effects of immigration policy.

Introduction
Undocumented migration has become an important 
public policy issue worldwide. From a public health 
perspective, it is well recognised that the estimated 
11 million undocumented immigrants in the USA1 and 
8 million in Europe2 are at risk of poor health outcomes.3–6 
In particular, the results of studies from both the USA 
and European settings suggest that immigration policies 
that raise the risk of deportation or place limits on legal 
rights and access to social services might raise the risk of 
poor mental health outcomes, such as depression and 
anxiety, and curtail access to health care more generally.7–15
In recent years, the USA has witnessed substantial 
changes in policies towards undocumented immigrants. 
In June, 2012, the US Government initiated the Deferred 
Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme, which 
provided temporary work permits and freedom from 
deportation to individuals who met specific eligibility 
criteria (panel).16 Although the programme has not been a 
pathway to citizenship, the work permits are renewable, 
ostensibly staving off the risk of deportation. Since its 
inception, the programme has enrolled more than 
720 000 of an estimated 1·9 million eligible individuals.17
In addition to any microeconomic and macroeconomic 
benefits, DACA could improve the health of beneficiaries 
in several ways. First, research has shown increases in 
employment and income after DACA implementation,18,19 
both of which are well known social determinants of 
health.20 Second, expanded economic opportunities 
might raise future aspirations and thereby increase

perceived returns on health investments, both of which 
can in turn affect health outcomes.21 Third, eliminating 
the risk of deportation and providing access to 
employment opportunities could raise hope and reduce 
psychosocial stress, which might directly improve mental 
health and indirectly affect physical health by leading to 
improved health behaviours.22,23
Despite these strong theoretical links, the health 
consequences of the DACA programme have not yet 
been explored. More generally, studies linking policies 
targeting undocumented migrants to health outcomes 
are generally descriptive, with the underlying causality 
less clear.7–15 This broader question has gained 
significance in recent months, as fundamental changes 
in US immigration policy are being debated.24,25
In this study we aimed to examine the consequences of 
the US DACA programme on self-reported overall and 
mental health among undocumented immigrants of 
Hispanic origin (who represent the majority of DACA-
eligible individuals). We used a quasi-experimental 
research strategy based on the timing of programme 
implementation, as well as eligibility rules, to estimate 
causal relationships.
Methods
Data
We used data from the US National Health Interview 
Survey (NHIS), an annual, nationally representative, 
repeated cross-sectional sample survey that tracks 
health outcomes, behaviours, and access to care in the 
US civilian, non-institutionalised population.26 We used 
surveys for the period January, 2008, to December, 2015. 
We restricted our sample to adults (aged 19–50 years) 
who reported Hispanic ethnicity because nearly 90% of 
DACA beneficiaries were born in central America or 
South 
America.27 
Following 
evidence 
from 
the 
economics literature,18 we prespecified that we would 
exclude individuals with less than a high school 
education 
and 
recently 
arrived 
immigrants 
to 
minimise 
confounding 
from 
well 
established 
differential trends in socioeconomic outcomes.28,29 These 
sample restrictions hold fixed two key DACA eligibility 
criteria (panel): completion of high school or its 
equivalent and residence in the USA for at least 5 years.
Exposures and outcomes
Our exposure measure was DACA eligibility based on 
two key criteria: age at immigration and age at the time 
of the policy change. We estimated age at immigration 
by subtracting years living in the USA from the 
participant’s current stated age; individuals aged 
16 years or younger at the time of immigration were 
defined as meeting this DACA eligibility criterion. 
Because the public-use files from the NHIS provide a 
binned value for years living in the USA (<1 year, 
1–4 years, 5–9 years, 10–14 years, and ≥15 years), our 
estimates of age at immigration were not exact and are 
therefore subject to classic measurement error. We 
used the exact date of birth to assess whether the 
individual met the other DACA eligibility criterion of 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and EconLit with the 
terms (“undocumented immigrants” OR “illegal immigrant” OR 
“undocumented migrant”) AND (“health” OR “mental health” 
OR “depression”) AND (“immigration policy” OR “deportation” 
OR “DACA”) OR (“Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals”). We 
did not apply any restrictions by language or date, and the latest 
search was done on Feb 7, 2017. We found two summative 
reviews and several commentary and research articles examining 
the association between immigration policy and health 
outcomes in the USA, Europe, and Australia. Most studies were 
descriptive in nature and used both qualitative and quantitative 
methods to show links between immigration policy and mental 
health outcomes, health-care access, or both. No studies used 
quasi-experimental methods to assess causality between 
changes in immigration policy and health. Although we found 
two studies investigating the economic effects of the US 
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) programme, we 
did not find any study examining its effects on health.
Added value of this study
We used a large, nationally representative survey of 
non-citizen, Hispanic adults living in the USA to investigate 
the effects of the DACA programme on self-reported overall 
health and psychological distress. We found that DACA 
eligibility was associated with large, clinically meaningful 
reductions in symptoms of psychological distress. We found 
no effects on self-reported overall health, although this 
finding was anticipated given the overall youth of the 
DACA-eligible population. Our findings contribute to the 
public health literature by showing for the first time robust, 
quasi-experimental evidence of the effect of immigration 
policy towards undocumented immigrants on their 
mental health.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our findings add to a growing evidence base showing strong 
links between immigration policy choices and health outcomes. 
These results might be informative for clinicians providing 
health care to undocumented immigrants, public health 
officials, and policy makers. Our findings are relevant to 
ongoing debates around immigration policy in the USA and 
Europe and suggest that mental health outcomes should be 
taken into account when considering policy alternatives.

being age 31 years or younger at the time of the policy 
announcement. 
Our primary outcomes were self-reported overall health 
(measured on a 5 point Likert scale, where a score of 1 
represents poor health, 2 represents fair health, 3 
represents good health, 4 represents very good health, and 
5 represents excellent health) and symptoms of 
non-specific psychologic distress as represented by the 
summed score from the Kessler 6 (K6) scale (symptoms of 
feeling nervous, hopeless, depressed, restless, depressed, 
that everything was an effort, and worthless over the past 
30 days assessed by six questions that are coded by 
frequency, with 0 representing none of the time, 
1 representing a little of the time, 2 representing some of 
the time, 3 representing  most of the time, and 4 
representing all of the time; the summed score can thus 
range from 0 to 24).30,31 The K6 was administered only to a 
randomly selected one-third sample of NHIS respondents. 
The K6 has been shown to have high reliability, validity, 
and internal consistency in identifying of the symptoms 
serious mental illness as denoted by the DSM-IV.30 We 
also used these variables to specify binary outcomes 
denoting self-reported classifications of poor or fair health 
(vs good, very good, or excellent health) and presence of 
moderate or worse psychological distress (K6 score ≥5).31
Statistical analyses
We used the difference-in-differences32 method to 
estimate the health consequences of DACA. Specifically, 
we estimated versions of the following regression models:
where the subscript i references the individual and t the 
year–month of the survey. Eligiblei is a binary indicator 
denoting whether the individual met DACA eligibility 
criteria (1 if DACA-eligible, 0 otherwise), and DACAt is a 
binary indicator for survey timing (1 if surveyed after 
DACA implementation in June, 2012, and 0 otherwise). 
Hit is the health outcome of interest and the function 
g(·)  refers to a least squares, Poisson, or logistic link 
function. The vector Xi(t) consists of key covariates, 
consisting of participant age in years at the time of the 
policy change, estimated age at immigration, census 
region of residence, gender, and year–month of 
interview. We adjusted for the complex survey design of 
the NHIS—which included use of sample weights 
(along with SEs robust to heteroscedasticity where 
appropriate)—in all analyses to recover nationally 
representative estimates.33 This step is particularly 
important given the reported (potentially non-random) 
decline in participation in the NHIS and other US 
sample surveys,34 which the weights are designed to take 
into account.
The difference-in-differences estimate (both in linear 
and non-linear models35) is denoted by the coefficient 
on the product term (β1). This estimate can be 
interpreted as the effect of the policy on DACA-eligible 
individuals before versus after the policy change, 
compared 
with 
the 
effect 
on 
DACA-ineligible 
individuals. We estimated least-squares regression 
models for self-reported health, and Poisson regression 
models for the count outcome (K6), both with 
heteroscedasticity-corrected standard errors. For the 
binary outcomes (poor or fair self-reported overall 
health and moderate or worse psychological distress), 
we 
est 
imated 
logistic 
regression 
models. 
We 
hypothesised larger estimates on mental health 
outcomes in view of findings from previous descriptive 
studies on migration,7–9,36 quasi-experimental studies on 
the health benefits of social policies,37,38 and the relative 
youth of our study population (who would otherwise be 
expected to be in good physical health).
Importantly, the NHIS did not elicit undocumented 
immigrant status from survey respondents. This is a 
long-standing feature of publicly available, large-scale 
US databases that are used to examine undocumented 
immigration.18,29 
Among 
self-reported 
non-citizens, 
60% of individuals are estimated to be undocumented.18 
Thus, our effect estimates will be smaller than the 
intention-to-treat effect. Additionally, data for other 
DACA eligibility criteria—criminal offenses and recent 
honourable discharge from the military—were also not 
available in the NHIS (because crimes and mis-
demeanours are not directly queried and honourable 
discharges were not queried after 2010). This data 
limitation is also likely to lead to attenuated estimates, as 
individuals with these histories might be inaccurately 
assigned to the treatment or control group.
We did four sensitivity analyses. First, because the 
Great Recession (2007–09) could have had differential 
effects 
on 
DACA-eligible 
versus 
DACA-ineligible 
individuals, we restricted our sample to participants

interviewed in 2010 and thereafter. Second, we further 
restricted the sample to individuals younger than 
40 years. This would help to account for differential time 
trends in the health of middle-aged immigrants, which 
might 
be 
distinct 
from 
younger 
DACA-eligible 
individuals, and therefore bias the difference-in-
differences estimates. Finally, as a pre-specified falsi-
fication test,39 we estimated our models for adults who 
had completed less than a high school education (and 
were not currently in school at the time of the survey): 
because these individuals were not DACA-eligible, we 
expected to observe no effect of the policy on their health 
outcomes. Fourth, we re-estimated all models without 
sampling weights; differences in coefficient estimates in 
weighted versus unweighted models might reflect errors 
in model specification, incorporation of the survey 
sampling process, or both.40
We did all analyses with Stata version 14. This study 
relied solely on public-use data so no ethical approval was 
sought for the study procedures.

Results
During the study period, 783 026 people were interviewed, 
and 14 973 people met our inclusion criteria (appendix). 
For the outcome of self-reported overall health, our total 
sample consisted of 14 973 survey respondents, of whom 
3972 were eligible for DACA. For the K6 psychological 
distress outcomes, our total sample contained 5035 
respondents, 1138 of whom were eligible for DACA. 
Before the start of DACA, DACA-eligible respondents 
reported slightly better overall health than did ineligible 
respondents, but had higher K6 scores and rates 
of moderate psychological distress (table 1). Mean K6 
scores and the likelihood of meeting screening criteria 
for moderate or worse psychological distress declined 
among DACA-eligible respondents in the survey years 
after policy implemen 
tation. However, similar declines 
did not occur for DACA-ineligible individuals. For both 
groups, mean self-reported overall health did not change, 
although we noted small increases in the likelihood of 
reporting poor or fair health in both groups. As expected 
on the basis of eligibility criteria, eligible respondents 
were younger and had immigrated to the USA earlier in 
their lives than had ineligible respondents. The sex and 
residential composition of the eligible and ineligible 
respondent samples were similar.
Difference-in-differences estimates (table 2) did not 
show significant changes in self-reported overall health 
before and after programme implementation for eligible 
versus ineligible respondents (adjusted b=0·056, 95% CI 
–0·024 to 0·14, p=0·17). However, our estimates showed 
significant reductions in K6 scores among DACA-eligible 
versus DACA-ineligible respondents (adjusted incident 
risk ratio 0·78, 95% CI 0·56–0·95, p=0·020). The binary 
outcomes showed similar patterns, with no significant 
differences estimated for the odds of reporting poor or 
fair health (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·98, 95% CI 
0·66–1·44, p=0·91), but a significant decline in the odds 
of reporting moderate or worse psychological distress 
before and after programme implementation for eligible 
versus ineligible respondents (aOR 0·62, 95% CI 
0·41–0·93, p=0·022).
Sensitivity analyses (table 3) showed similar coefficient 
estimates when we restricted estimation to individuals 
in the same age range interviewed between 2010 
and 2015 and when we further restricted the sample 
to individuals younger than 40 years. Consistent with 
programme eligibility criteria, we found no evidence 
that DACA improved outcomes for DACA-ineligible 
people (ie, individuals with less than a high school 
education). We found mostly similar results in analyses 
without sampling weights (appendix), suggesting that 
the specification of our model and handling of the 
complex survey design was appropriate.

led 
to 
meaningful 
reductions 
in 
symptoms 
of 
psychological distress among DACA-eligible individuals. 
The effects on mental health were large and clinically 
significant, with the DACA programme significantly 
reducing the odds of individuals reporting moderate or 
worse psychological distress. We did not find any 
improvements in self-reported overall health, which was 
consistent with the fact that the population was relatively 
young (mean age <40 years in all groups) and therefore 
generally in good physical health.
Our findings advance the existing public health 
literature by providing the first quasi-experimental 
evidence of a link between immigration policies that 
target undoc 
umented immigrants and their health 
outcomes. The findings of large effects on mental health 
are consistent with results from observational studies 
showing rising symptoms of anxiety and depression with 
policies that raise the risk of deportation.7–15 These findings 
could be of considerable importance in the current policy 
environ 
ment, with the USA broadening the legal 
infrastructure and human resources base needed to 
deport undocumented immigrants and restrict the entry 
of new migrants.24,41 Additionally—as of the time of 
writing—the future of the DACA programme itself seems 
to be in doubt.42
In addition to informing the public health community 
about the health impacts of immigration policy, our 
findings add to a growing evidence base on the mental 
health consequences of social policies more generally.37,38 
Our findings also show the importance of economic 
opportunities for health outcomes. In particular, the use 
of quasi-experimental methods builds on and greatly

Differences-in-differences estimates of the effects of the DACA programme on health outcomes. Estimator and interpretation of coefficient is provided in the column header. For 
the ordinary least-squares (self-reported health) and Poisson (K6 score) models, we calculated 95% CIs with heteroscedasticity-corrected SEs. The estimates shown reflect 
coefficients on the interaction between binary indicators that denote meeting the eligibility criteria of age at immigration (16 years or younger) and age at policy implementation 
(31 years or younger) and being surveyed after programme implementation (June, 2012). All models include the main effects for meeting DACA eligibility thresholds, interview 
year–month fixed effects (which subsume the main effects of being surveyed after DACA implementation), and adjust for respondent age (at the time of policy), gender, fixed-
effects for years living in the USA, and fixed effects census region of residence. All models use National Health Interview Survey sampling weights. K6=Kessler 6 scale. IRR=incident

advances findings from observational studies linking 
measures of area-level economic opportunity to various 
health outcomes.21,43–45
Several limitations are inherent to the data available 
and the study design. First, despite the quasi-
experimental research strategy, unobserved bias from 
time-varying factors that differentially affect immigrants 
who are eligible or ineligible for DACA cannot be 
definitively excluded. The potential for such confounders 
might be exacerbated by the fact that the NHIS data 
represent repeated cross sections rather than a panel. 
Moreover, well described downward trends exist in 
sample survey participation in the USA.34 We supported 
the robustness of our findings by showing that estimates 
remained similar when we applied tighter restrictions to 
the estimation sample. We also did a falsification test, the 
results of which showed the absence of an association 
among individuals who met all other eligibility criteria 
except for high school completion.
Second, differences in mean ages among DACA-
eligible and DACA-ineligible respondents, which are 
inevitable because age is part of the eligibility criteria, 
might also generate bias in our results. To address these 
differences, we included individual age-specific fixed 
effects to flexibly control for non-linear age effects. We 
also estimated our models with a narrower age band, 
which produced mostly similar estimates.
Third, the NHIS did not specifically identify un-
documented immigrants, exact age at immigration, or 
individuals who met two other DACA eligibility criteria 
(absence of criminal history and honourable discharge 
from the military). However, each of these data limitations 
would bias our estimates toward the null, either by 
deflating estimates of the intention-to-treat effect, 
introducing classic measurement error, or inaccurately 
assigning respondents to eligible and ineligible groups. 
Finally, well known differences exist between US states in 
the implementation and acceptance of DACA,17,46 which 
might have modified programme effects on health 
outcomes. Unfortunately, we cannot examine this 
possibility in the NHIS because the public-use data do not 
include state identifiers.
In conclusion, we found that the DACA programme 
had important, positive effects on mental health outcomes. 
These benefits have so far been underappreciated and, in 
conjunction with the reported positive economic benefits,18 
can help to guide ongoing policy debates47 around the 
overall benefit of the DACA programme and its future in 
US immigration policy, as well as around the design of 
policies towards undocumented migrants in Europe.
