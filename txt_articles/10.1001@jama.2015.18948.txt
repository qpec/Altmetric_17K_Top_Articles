IMPORTANCE Depression is a source of substantial burden for individuals and their families,
including women during the pregnant and postpartum period.
OBJECTIVE To systematically review the benefits and harms of depression screening and
treatment, and accuracy of selected screening instruments, for pregnant and postpartum
women. Evidence for depression screening in adults in general is available in the full report.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Collaboration Registry of
Controlled Trials through January 20, 2015; references; and government websites.
STUDYSELECTION English-languagetrialsofbenefitsandharmsofdepressionscreening,depression
treatment in pregnant and postpartum women with screen-detected depression, and diagnostic
accuracystudiesofdepressionscreeninginstrumentsinpregnantandpostpartumwomen.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and
full-text articles and extracted data from fair- and good-quality studies. Random-effects
meta-analysis was used to estimate the benefit of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in
pregnant and postpartum women.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Depression remission, prevalence, symptoms, and related
measures of depression recovery or response; sensitivity and specificity of selected screening
measures to detect depression; and serious adverse effects of antidepressant treatment.
RESULTS Among pregnant and postpartum women 18 years and older, 6 trials (n = 11 869)
showed 18% to 59% relative reductions with screening programs, or 2.1% to 9.1% absolute
reductions, in the risk of depression at follow-up (3-5 months) after participation in programs
involving depression screening, with or without additional treatment components, compared
with usual care. Based on 23 studies (n = 5398), a cutoff of 13 on the English-language
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale demonstrated sensitivity ranging from 0.67 (95% CI,
0.18-0.96) to 1.00 (95% CI, 0.67-1.00) and specificity consistently 0.87 or higher. Data were
sparse for Patient Health Questionnaire instruments. Pooled results for the benefit of CBT for
pregnant and postpartum women with screen-detected depression showed an increase in
the likelihood of remission (pooled relative risk, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.19-1.50]; No. of studies
[K] = 10, I2 = 7.9%) compared with usual care, with absolute increases ranging from 6.2% to
34.6%. Observational evidence showed that second-generation antidepressant use during
pregnancy may be associated with small increases in the risks of potentially serious harms.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Direct and indirect evidence suggested that screening
pregnant and postpartum women for depression may reduce depressive symptoms in
women with depression and reduce the prevalence of depression in a given population.
Evidence for pregnant women was sparser but was consistent with the evidence for
postpartum women regarding the benefits of screening, the benefits of treatment, and
screening instrument accuracy.

a combination of results from the 2002 USPSTF review,8 which in-
cluded very little evidence related to pregnant and postpartum
women, and a targeted update published in 2009, which excluded
studies limited to pregnant and postpartum women.9 We under-
took the current review to help the USPSTF update its recommen-
dation on depression screening and expand it to include evidence
related to pregnant and postpartum women.
Methods
Scope of Review
Detailed methods are available in the full evidence report at
http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document
/final-evidence-review144/depression-in-adults-screening1.10
Evidence related to general and older adults was only minimally
changedfromthepreviousreviewandarealsopresentedinthefull
report. In this article, the focus is on the direct and indirect evi-
dencefordepressionscreeningofpregnantandpostpartumwomen,
where most new evidence was found. The analytic framework and
key questions (KQs) to guide the portion of our review related to
pregnant and postpartum women are shown in Figure 1.
Data Sources and Searches
An initial search was conducted for existing synthesized literature
and guidelines related to depression screening and treatment in
MEDLINE/PubMed, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of
Effects, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, BMJ Clinical
Evidence, Institute of Medicine, the National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence, PsycINFO, the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality, the American Psychiatric Association, the
American Psychological Association, the Campbell Collaboration,
the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, the
National Health Services’Health Technology Assessment Pro-
gramme, and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, from
2008 through October 3, 2013. The search strategies are listed in
the eMethods in the Supplement.
For pregnant and postpartum women, abstracts and full-text
articles were systematically evaluated to identify existing system-
atic reviews to incorporate into the review, based on an approach
outlined by Whitlock et al.11 Three good-quality reviews were iden-
tified that served as foundational reviews for 1 or more KQs. These
reviews were chosen based on relevance (ie, inclusion and exclu-
sioncriteriathatwereatleastasinclusiveasourreview),havingcon-
ducted a good-quality search, having reported good-quality article
evaluation methods, and recency.12-14 For the question of harms of
antidepressants (KQ5), 1 of the foundational reviews was of suffi-
cient quality, and the evidence base was so extensive, that this re-
viewwasuseddirectlyasevidenceinthereportandindividualstud-
ies included in this review were not reevaluted.14 The other 2

ter the search windows of these foundational reviews.12,13 All stud-
ies included in each of these 2 foundational reviews were evalu-
ated against our a priori inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Study Selection
Two investigators independently reviewed 6536 titles and ab-
stracts and 478 full-text articles against prespecified inclusion cri-
teria (Figure 2). Disagreements were resolved through discussion
or consultation with other investigators. We included English lan-
guage fair- and good-quality studies involving women who were 18
years and older and pregnant or postpartum (within 1 year of birth
atenrollment)andlivingin“veryhigh-developed”countriesaccord-
ing to the World Health Organization.15 Studies limited to persons
withothermedicalormentalhealthconditionswereexcluded;how-
ever,studiesthatincludedsomepersonswithsuchconditionswere
not excluded, as long as it was not a requirement of participation.
Forbenefitsandharmsofdepressionscreening(KQ1,KQ3),we
included randomized or nonrandomized clinical trials conducted in
primary care settings, including obstetrics/gynecology or, for post-
partumwomen,pediatrics.Toallowdeterminationofthefullpopu-
lationeffectofscreeningprograms,studiesthatincludedsomepar-
ticipants who already had a medical record diagnosis of depression
or were being treated for depression were not excluded. Studies of
depression screening could also include additional treatment ele-
ments, as long as the screening test results were given to the pri-
marycareclinician.Arequirementwasthatthecontrolgroupeither
was not screened (KQ1) or did not have screening test results sent
to their clinician (KQ1a). Outcomes had to be reported at a mini-
mum of 6 weeks after randomization.
For diagnostic accuracy (KQ2), we examined studies of the Pa-
tient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) or Edinburgh Postnatal Depres-
sion Scale (EPDS) compared with a valid reference standard, which
was defined as a structured or semistructured diagnostic interview
with a trained interviewer or a nonbrief (>5 minutes) unstructured

with individual outreach to potential participants for depression
screening as part of determination of study eligibility. Thus, studies
were excluded in which recruitment was based on referral, recruit-

controls who were not taking antidepressants.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Two investigators independently assessed the quality of the in-
cludedstudiesbyusingcriteriadefinedbytheUSPSTF16andsupple-
mented with criteria from the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic
Accuracy 2 (QUADAS-2)17 for diagnostic accuracy studies, the
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS)18 for observational studies, and
A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) for
systematic reviews (eTable 1 in the Supplement).19 Each study was
assigned a final quality rating of good, fair, or poor; disagreements
between the investigators were resolved through discussion. We
rated and excluded studies as poor quality if there was a major
“fatal flaw”(eg, attrition was >40%, differential attrition >20%) or
multiple important limitations that could invalidate the results.

Data Synthesis and Analysis
We created summary tables of study characteristics, population
characteristics, intervention characteristics, and outcomes sepa-
rately for each KQ. These tables and forest plots of the results were
used to examine the consistency, precision, and relationship of
effect size with key potential modifiers. We had a sufficient number
of trials with acceptable comparability to conduct a meta-analysis
of trials examining the benefits of cognitive behavioral therapy
(CBT) and related approaches. Because this analysis included 10
studies with low statistical heterogeneity, as assessed by the I2 sta-
tistic, and fairly comparable sample sizes, a random-effects model
was used (DerSimonian and Laird),20 with a sensitivity analysis
using a restricted maximum likelihood model with the Knapp-
Hartung modification for small samples.21 Funnel plots and the
Egger test were used to examine the risk of small study effects. For
the studies of instrument accuracy (KQ2), sensitivity and specificity
with Jeffrey confidence intervals were calculated, using data from
2 × 2 tables that included true positives, false positives, false nega-
tives, and true negatives. Several studies only verified a negative
screening result in a random sample of participants below a prede-
termined threshold (which was lower than the typical cutoffs for a
positive screener in all cases).22-24 For these studies, the proportion
with a depressive disorder according to the reference standard was
applied to the full sample of those below the threshold, and sensi-
tivity and specificity were calculated based on these extrapolated
results.25 In all cases, there were no false negatives, so sensitivity
did not change, but specificity increased with extrapolation,
although we were unable to accurately determine the number of
noncases for 1 study and so did not calculate specificity.22 Side-by-
side plots of sensitivity and specificity were created in R version
3.2.2 (R Foundation); all other analyses were conducted in Stata
version 13.1 (StataCorp). All significance testing was 2-sided, and
results were considered statistically significant if the P value was
.05 or less.

atweek25ofgestation29or4to8weekspostpartum.22,26-28,30Only
1 trial was conducted in the United States.26 Both of the individu-
ally randomized trials excluded women who were currently being
treated for depression26,27; however, the trials that randomized at
the level of a midwife or medical practice all had very broad inclu-
sion criteria and did not exclude women being treated for
depression.22,28-30 All studies used the EPDS for screening; cutoffs
forscreeningpositiverangedfrom10to13.While1trialfocusednar-
rowly on the benefit of adding the EPDS to the usual clinical
evaluation,22 others provided a wide range of components in addi-
tiontothescreeningintervention,suchascliniciantrainingandsup-
port, person-centered counseling, or redesigned follow-up care.
At follow-up, which ranged from 1.5 to 16 months, 5 of 6 trials
reported the proportion of women scoring above a specified cut-
off on the EPDS, which we refer to as depression prevalence
(Figure 3). In pregnant and postpartum women, there were rela-
tive reductions of 18% to 59% in the risk of depression at follow-up
compared with usual care, which translated to 2.1% to 9.1% abso-
lute reductions in depression prevalence, according to a variety of
EPDS cutoff definitions. For example, depression prevalence (de-
fined as an EPDS score �10) was 13% in the screened group in the
Hong Kong–based screening-only intervention in the near term (4
months) but 22.1% in the nonscreened group.27 However, this ef-
fect was not sustained at 16 months.27 In the study of pregnant
women that included feedback of screening results and a 1-after-
noon depression training session for midwives, the effect size was
smaller and not statistically significant, with 9.5% of women in the
interventiongroupreportingEPDSscoresof12ormoreatfollow-up,

are arranged in the order of decreasing proportion meeting the ref-
erence standard diagnosis, separately for English-version EPDS and
non–English-version EPDS; PHQ studies are ordered by the PHQ
versions reported). Eight of the included studies used the English-
language version of the EPDS (n = 1905).22,23,32,39,41,42,48,49 Six of
the English-language EPDS studies assessed postpartum women,
usually between 6 and 12 weeks postpartum,24,26,28,34,37,39 1
assessed pregnant women,48 and 1 assessed women at any point
during pregnancy and up to 26 weeks postpartum.42 We focused
on the English-language EPDS and standard cutoff scores of 10 (in-
dicating moderate-level symptoms) and 13 (indicating probable
depressive disorder) for the EPDS.
At a cutoff score of 13 for identifying MDD, the sensitivity of
the English-language EPDS ranged from 0.67 (95% CI, 0.18-0.96)
to 1.00 (95% CI, 0.67-1.00), with most of the results between
0.75 and 0.82 (Figure 5 and eFigure 1 in the Supplement). The
largest of these studies,22 from the United Kingdom, reported a
sensitivity of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.72-0.85), which was very similar to
that seen in a relatively recent US-based study with low-income
African American women with a high rate of depression (0.81
[95% CI, 0.64-0.93]).42 The specificity of the English-language
EPDS was 0.87 or greater in all studies. Sensitivity for detecting
depressive disorders, including both major and minor depression,
using the cutoff of 10 or greater ranged from 0.63 (95% CI,
0.44-0.79)23 to 0.84.42,49 At a cutoff score of 10, the study of
low-income African American women reported42 sensitivity of
0.84 (95% CI, 0.69-0.94) and specificity of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.70-
0.89) for identifying major or minor depression in pregnant and
postpartum women combined. The estimates were very similar
for pregnant and postpartum women.42
The PHQ studies covered 3 different versions of the PHQ
(PHQ-2,51-53PHQ-8,53PHQ-951)and3differentscoringmethodsfor
the PHQ-2 (Figure 6 and eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Sensitivi-
ties and specificities were fairly wide-ranging across different ver-
sions,scoringmethods,diagnosticcomparators,andcutoffs,andno
single method was reported in more than 1 study.
Harms of Screening
Key Question 3. What are the harms associated with primary care
depressionscreeningprogramsinpregnantandpostpartumwomen?
Among the trials addressing the benefits of screening (KQ1), 1
trial reported that there were no adverse effects of depression
screening in postpartum women (n = 462; Table 1)27; the remain-
ing 5 trials did not report on harms.
Benefits of Treatment
Key Question 4. Does treatment (psychotherapy, antidepres-
sants, or collaborative care) result in improved health outcomes
(decreased depressive symptomatology; decreased suicide
deaths, attempts, or ideation; improved functioning; improved
quality of life; or improved health status) in pregnant and postpar-
tum women who screen positive for depression in primary care?
We identified 2 good-quality and 16 fair-quality trials (n = 1638)
that examined the benefits of interventions in pregnant and post-
partum women who had screened positive for depression in a pri-
mary care or community setting, generally compared with usual
care54-71 (Table 3, trials are arranged in increasing order of esti-
mated contact hours with the intervention). One trial combined
treatment in depressed women and prevention in women who
were not depressed, but we only included results related to the
depressed subgroup (n = 324).63 Fifteen of 18 trials recruited
women during the postpartum period (�22 weeks) and 3 during
their pregnancy.63,64,71 All 18 trials reported outcomes during the
postpartum period. Time to follow-up varied widely, from 6
weeks59,69 to 18 months.56 Furthermore, trials varied in time
between end of treatment and follow-up assessment, with 7 trials
conducting follow-up assessment within 2 weeks of when treat-
ment ended,55,57,62,65,66,69,71 while the remaining had a lag of 1 to 7
months between end of treatment and follow-up assessment. The
most common behavioral interventions were CBT or related inter-
ventions that included traditional CBT components, such as stress
management, goal setting, and problem solving, including 2 trials
conducted with pregnant women.63,64 Other intervention
approaches included fluoxetine,55 a health care system–level
stepped-care intervention,57 nondirective counseling,56,60,69
psychodynamic therapy,58 an information-only intervention,59
and 2 different approaches to improving the mother-infant
relationship.58,62
Of 18 trials, 15 reported an outcome similar to depression
remission (usually the proportion below a specified cut
point on a depression symptom scale) at follow-up ranging from 1.5
to 18 months (Figure 7, only outcomes within 1 year
shown).54,56-61,63-67,69-71 All 10 trials that used CBT or related inter-
ventions showed an increased likelihood of remission with treat-
ment in the short-term, although not all results were statistically
significant.54,56,61,63-67,70,71 Effect sizes were similar for pregnant
and postpartum women for CBT. Pooled results that used only the
longest follow-up (within 1 year) showed an increase in the likeli-
hood of remission with CBT (DerSimonian and Laird pooled relative
risk [RR], 1.34 [95% CI, 1.19-1.50]; No. of studies (K) = 10; I2 = 7.9%)
compared with usual care, with absolute increases ranging from
6.2% to 34.6%. Results were almost identical in sensitivity analyses
using a more conservative pooling method, with even lower statis-
tical heterogeneity (restricted maximum likelihood pooled RR, 1.34
[95% CI, 1.17-1.53]; K = 10, I2 = 0%). Increased hours of contact
might be associated with larger effect sizes, but because contact
hours, sample size, control group remission rates, and time to
follow-up were all confounded with each other, conclusions could
not be drawn about their relative importance. The funnel plot
(eFigure 3 in the Supplement) suggested an increased risk of small
studies bias, consistent with increased risk of publication bias; the
Egger test did not identify a statistically significant small studies
bias, but power was limited. The possibility of correlation between
sample size and effect size raises the concern that the pooled
effect may overestimate the true effect.

groups. The pooled standardized mean difference in change be-

Becausenon-CBTapproaches,includingfluoxetine,werehighly
variable in their effects and were limited by lack of replication, firm
conclusions about those approaches could not be drawn.
Harms of Treatment
Key Question 5. What are the harms of treatment in pregnant and
postpartum women who screen positive for depression in primary
care?
Key Question 5b. What is the prevalence of other selected se-
riousharmsoftreatmentwithantidepressantsinthegeneral(ie,not
limited to primary care) population of pregnant and postpartum
women?
The examination of harms of antidepressants was limited to
second-generation agents: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs), selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, bupropion,
nefazodone, trazodone, and mirtazapine. Ten of the included stud-
ies on harms of treatment for depression were of good quality, and
4 were of fair quality (Table 4, studies are ordered by study design,
then by primary reported outcome). Of the trials that addressed
benefits of treatment, which all involved screen-identified patients,
only the trial of fluoxetine also reported on harms of treatment.55
At 12 weeks of follow-up, 1 of 43 women (2.3%) taking fluoxetine
and 3 of 44 women (6.8%) taking the placebo discontinued it due
to adverse effects.
Considering studies not limited to women with screen-
detecteddepression,agood-qualitysystematicreviewpublishedin
201314identified15observationalstudiesprovidingevidenceofthe
harms of antidepressants at unknown dosages in pregnant de-
pressed women. The review included an additional 109 observa-
tional studies that provided evidence of the harms of antidepres-
santsinpregnantwomeninwhomdepressionstatusineitherorboth
treatmentgroupswasunknown.Whenavailable,datalimitedtode-
pressed women were our focus.
An additional 12 fair- or good-quality large observational stud-
ies were identified that were published between 2012 and 2014
and that examined the harms of antidepressants in pregnant or
postpartum women (n = 4 759 735).73-84 Three were case-control
studies82-84; the remaining were cohort studies that used national
registers or administrative health data to examine exposures
and outcomes retrospectively in women who had been pregnant.
Five studies provided evidence of outcomes in pregnant women
with known depression who were or were not exposed to
antidepressants.74-76,78,84 The remaining 7 studies compared out-
comes in exposed vs unexposed pregnant women with unknown
depression status, although most of these analyses adjusted for
presence of depression79 or conducted some analyses that were
restricted to depressed women.77,80,81
Detailed results of the harms of treatment are shown in
eTable 2 in the Supplement. There was evidence that use of some
antidepressants during pregnancy, particularly SSRIs and venla-
faxine, are associated with increased risk of preeclampsia, post-
partum hemorrhage, and miscarriage as well as a number of
adverse infant outcomes, including neonatal or postneonatal
death, preterm birth, small for gestational age, neonatal seizures,
serotonin withdrawal syndrome, neonatal respiratory distress,
pulmonary hypertension, or major congenital malformations. The
absolute increase in risk for most infant outcomes was very small,
given the rarity of the events, and sometimes occurred only with
higher levels of exposure. For example, a large retrospective
cohort study reported a more than doubling of seizure occur-
rence in infants of depressed women who had been provided 3 or
more prescription fills for antidepressants of any kind (but pri-
marily SSRIs). However, the absolute risk remained quite small
(0.66% among exposed infants vs 0.28% in unexposed infants;
unadjusted OR, 2.39 [95% CI, 1.57-3.64]).75 In that study, there
was no similar association among women with 1 or 2 prescription
fills for antidepressants.
More common outcomes showed potentially important abso-
luteincreases.Onestudyinthe2013review14reportedneonatalre-
spiratory distress among 7.8% of infants not exposed to SSRIs in
utero, compared with 13.9% of exposed infants, and a pooled esti-
mate combining 3 studies showed an increased odds of respiratory

sants during pregnancy.
Discussion
We examined recent information on the benefits and harms of
depression screening and treatment and the accuracy of selected
screening instruments for pregnant and postpartum women to
support the USPSTF updated recommendation on these topics.
Evidence suggested that programs to screen pregnant and post-
partum women, with or without additional treatment-related sup-
ports, reduced the prevalence of depression and increased remis-
sion or treatment response (Table 5). Most of the screening trials
included in this review provided treatment elements beyond
screening, such as clinician training and supports, treatment proto-
cols, or counseling with specially trained clinicians. Sensitivity of
the English-language version of the EPDS was estimated to be
approximately 0.80 and specificity approximately 0.90, using a
cutoff of 13 to detect postpartum MDD. Further, evidence sug-
gested that CBT improved depression in women with postpartum
depression. In addition, the use of second-generation antidepres-
sants during pregnancy may be associated with increased risk of
some serious harms.
Evidence primarily focused on postpartum women, except for
harms of antidepressants, but the little evidence among pregnant
womensuggestedcomparableeffectwithpostpartumwomen.Im-

of screening, it is nevertheless a potentially important side benefit
ofdepressionscreeningprograms.Further,depressionscreeningpre-
sents an opportunity to query suicidal ideation among those who
screen positive. While the USPSTF has not recommended routine
screening for suicide risk, they did note that “primary care clini-
cians should be aware of psychiatric problems in their patients and
shouldconsideraskingthesepatientsaboutsuicidalideationandre-

completely treated patients could be considered an added benefit

5 RCTs,

Trials reported reasonably consistent (yet imprecise) relative
decreases in prevalence of depression (18%-59%) with
depression screening (± additional components) and increases in
remission/treatment response (21%-33%) in women with
depressive symptoms at baseline. Two interventions focused on
screening with minimal additional supports or counseling
reduced depression in the near-term (≤4 mo). Four interventions
with additional clinician supports or counseling consistently
improved depression outcomes.
All studies were conducted in maternal
health or other primary care settings;
however, only 1 was conducted in the
United States, and 3 involved home
visits, which are rarely used in the
United States.
A small number of studies were included; wide
range of intervention approaches with no
replication of any interventions were included
that reported minimal descriptions of the
samples (eg, age, race/ethnicity, previous
depression); minimal information on the role of
screening in the beneficial results was available.

Diagnostic
accuracy
For detecting MDD in the first 3 mo postpartum, sensitivity of
the English-language EPDS was estimated to be approximately
0.80 and specificity approximately 0.90, with a cutoff of 13.
Evidence was reasonably consistent and reasonably precise. In a
population with 10% MDD prevalence, PPV was estimated at 47%
for detecting MDD. Using a cutoff of 10 for detecting depressive
disorders, including minor depression, evidence was somewhat
inconsistent and imprecise: sensitivity was estimated between
0.63 to 0.84, specificity between 0.80 and 0.90. PPVs were 43%
and 50% at these sensitivity levels and specificity of 0.85 in a
population with 15% prevalence of depressive disorders.
Only 2 studies of English-language
version were conducted in the United
States, but study with best applicability
reported relatively good performance
characteristics.
Limited data on the English-language version,
much of it collected 15-25 y ago; studies
generally had small No. of observations; training
and fidelity associated with the reference
standard were rarely reported; the
English-language version of 2 studies did not
report interval between EPDS and reference
test. Reporting bias is possible, based on use of
optimal cutoffs, but most English-version EPDS
studies reported on commonly used cutoffs of
10 and 13.

Diagnostic
accuracy
Sensitivity and specificity were fairly wide-ranging over different
versions of the PHQ, different scoring methods, different cutoffs,
and different comparators (MDD vs major or minor depression).
Sensitivities ranged from 0.62 to 1.00 and specificities ranged
from 0.59 to 0.91. Evidence was inconsistent and imprecise.
Two of 3 studies were conducted in the
United States, within past 5 y,
including 18%-20% black participants,
but other racial/ethnic minority groups
were not represented.
A small number of studies were included, with
no replication for any specific version, scoring
method, cutoff, and comparator; studies had
small samples, resulting in ≤5 false negatives.
Reporting bias was possible, as 1 of the 3 studies
reported optimal cut points based on receiver

CBT and related therapeutic approaches showed reasonably

likelihood of remission: RR, 1.34 (95% CI, 1.19-1.50) in the
short term (<8 mo) and reduced symptom severity. Larger
effects were generally associated with greater contact hours;
however, contact time was confounded with other important
sources of heterogeneity. Data were insufficient to evaluate
other treatment approaches, including stepped care (K = 1) and
fluoxetine (K = 1).
Limited to studies of screen-detected
depression conducted in or recruited
from primary care, but only 3 were
conducted in the United States; little
information was available about
population characteristics, particularly
racial/ethnic background.
Most trials were small and with ≥1

possible, as a variety of definitions were used for
remission, and it is possible that the definition
with largest effect was presented in some

Second-generation antidepressants were associated with a
higher risk of some serious adverse effects with a consistent and
reasonably precise effect for most outcomes. Positive
associations between antidepressants and harms for
preeclampsia (venlafaxine), postpartum hemorrhage (SSRI for
≥60 d exposure, SNRI), miscarriage (SSRI first trimester, SNRI),
neonatal or postneonatal death (SSRI), preterm birth (SSRI in
first and second trimesters, SNRI), small for gestational age
(SSRI), infant seizures (SSRI), serotonin withdrawal syndrome
(SSRI, SNRI), neonatal respiratory distress (SSRI), pulmonary
hypertension (SSRI, particularly late in pregnancy), major
malformations (SSRI), and cardiac malformations (paroxetine,
venlafaxine, bupropion). Negative studies are not summarized
here: for most outcomes with studies showing positive
associations, other studies revealed no associations.
Approximately one-third of studies
were conducted in the United States
and the majority of the others were
conducted in Europe.
Almost all evidence was in observational studies
rather than trials, so causality could not be
clearly determined; many studies compared
harms in groups of women with unknown
depression status, exaggerating the potential for
confounding by indication; no data were
available to examine harms by dose, although
some did examine harms by length of exposure;
most studies used pharmacy fills to examine
exposure but did not verify whether women were
taking antidepressants as prescribed. Reporting
bias was unlikely as most studies included a
limited number of outcomes and used medical
records to ascertain exposure and outcomes.

sible that they missed or incorrectly interpreted evidence.
Conclusions
The direct evidence suggested that screening pregnant and post-
partum women for depression may reduce depressive symptoms
in women with depression and reduce the prevalence of depres-
sion in a given population, particularly in the presence of additional
treatmentsupports(eg,treatmentprotocols,caremanagement,and
availability of specially trained depression care clinicians). The indi-
rectevidenceshowedthatscreeninginstrumentscanidentifypreg-

of antidepressants during pregnancy, although the absolute risk of
harm appeared to be small and CBT appeared to be an effective al-
ternative treatment approach.
