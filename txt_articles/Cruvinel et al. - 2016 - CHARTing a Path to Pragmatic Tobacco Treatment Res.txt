Abstract
Introduction—It is important to consider the degree to which studies are explanatory versus 
pragmatic to understand the implications of their findings for patients, healthcare professionals, 
and policymakers. Pragmatic trials test the effectiveness of interventions in real-world conditions; 
explanatory trials test for efficacy under ideal conditions. The Consortium of Hospitals Advancing 
Research on Tobacco (CHART) is a network of seven NIH-funded trials designed to identify 
effective programs that can be widely implemented in routine clinical practice.

 Methods—A cross-sectional analysis of CHART trial study designs was conducted to place each 
study on the pragmatic–explanatory continuum. After reliability training, six raters independently 
scored each CHART study according to ten PRagmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator 
Summary (PRECIS) dimensions, which covered participant eligibility criteria, intervention 
flexibility, practitioner expertise, follow-up procedures, participant compliance, practitioner 
adherence, and outcome analyses. Means and SDs were calculated for each dimension of each 
study, with lower scores representing more pragmatic elements. Results were plotted on “spoke 
and wheel” diagrams. The rating process and analyses were performed in October 2014 to 
September 2015.
Results—All seven CHART trials tended toward the pragmatic end of the spectrum, although 
there was a range from 0.76 (SD=0.23) to 1.85 (SD=0.58). Most studies included some 
explanatory design elements.
Conclusions—CHART findings should be relatively applicable to clinical practice. Funders and 
reviewers could integrate PRECIS criteria into their guidelines to better facilitate pragmatic 
research. CHART study protocols, coupled with scores reported here, may help readers improve 
the design of their own pragmatic trials.
Introduction
Few hospitals treat tobacco dependence, possibly owing to a lack of practical strategies for 
integrating treatment into clinical practice.1 The Consortium of Hospitals Advancing 
Research on Tobacco (CHART) consisted of seven studies focused on implementing tobacco 
treatment into hospital care across a geographically diverse group of nearly 20 private, 
public, academic, and community hospitals in the U.S.1 Pragmatic trials deliver 
interventions under real-world conditions to all typical patients, to inform decision makers 
whether an intervention can and should be adopted into clinical practice. An explanatory 
trial is a highly controlled study in a selective population that gives a new intervention its 
best chance at demonstrating a beneficial effect.2-5 Pragmatic trials are increasingly 
important to funders, providers, and healthcare systems in general to provide information 
about how to improve the quality of clinical practice. The present study describes the 
pragmatic—versus explanatory—nature of the CHART trials.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
The study was conducted from October 2014 to September 2015. Five of the projects were 
two-arm RCTs comparing active interventions to usual care 6-10; one used a factorial design 
to test the effects of two different interventions alone and in combination11; and the last used 
group randomization procedures to assign hospitals to intervention and control conditions.12 
Some interventions were initiated during hospitalization,6,12 but most were delivered post-
discharge.10,11 Table 1 provides study details.12

 Measures
Assessment employed the following ten PRagmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator 
Summary (PRECIS) dimensions13:
1.
eligibility criteria;
2.
flexibility of the experimental intervention;
3.
practitioner expertise in experimental intervention;
4.
flexibility of the comparison condition;
5.
practitioner expertise in comparison intervention;
6.
follow-up intensity;
7.
measured outcomes;
8.
participant compliance;
9.
practitioner adherence; and
10.
primary analysis.
Unlike the original PRECIS tool, which had no discrete rating scores,13 raters could score 
each dimension from 0 (completely pragmatic) to 4 (completely explanatory). Scores were 
displayed as a “wheel” charted on spokes that represent each design dimension13—also 
known as a “pragmascope” Trials that took a more explanatory approach produced small 
wheels close to the “hub”; more-pragmatic trials produced larger wheels.
Data Collection and Management
Eleven researchers involved with the CHART studies served as raters. Ratings were based on 
published CHART protocol papers.1,3-9 Raters were trained following procedures used by 
Glasgow et al.14 Raters read an article on PRECIS concepts and criteria,13 reviewed an 
updated slide presentation on how to apply criteria (outlined in Appendix), and as a group 
discussed how to complete the PRECIS rating form. To enhance reliability, all 11 raters 
independently scored three study protocols, discussed the results, and altered the scoring 
form to improve usability. Then, raters used the final PRECIS form (Appendix) to 
independently score all protocols, including the three protocols used for reliability training. 
Six raters scored each protocol. The final form included an “insufficient information” (“II”) 
code for instances in which there was too little information to assign a score.
Statistical Analysis
Mean scores were calculated for each dimension of each study. Means were plotted on spoke 
and wheel diagrams. Only five of 420 dimension ratings were coded “II.” In these cases, 
missing data were replaced with the mean of the other five scores on that dimension. The 
overall PRECIS score for each study was calculated by summing the means of the ten 
dimensions and dividing by 10; SDs were also calculated to describe the variability in 
scores.

 Results
Table 2 displays PRECIS mean scores and SDs by site. All CHART trials tended to the 
pragmatic end of the spectrum with means closer to 0 than 4. Michigan had the lowest mean 
(0.76[SD=0.23]), and New York the highest (1.85[SD=0.58]). Other studies’ means ranged 
between 1 and 2. Raters closely agreed on scores, with four trials displaying a range of <1 
point (Kansas, Michigan, California, and Alabama).
Table 2 also displays the mean scores of each PRECIS dimension by site. Most studies had a 
mix of explanatory and pragmatic design elements. Common explanatory elements (with a 
mean≥2) included specially trained practitioners for the experimental intervention, close 
adherence to study protocols, and intensive follow-up attempts to contact participants. These 
same protocols, however, employed a number of pragmatic features (with a mean <2) such 
as flexible comparison interventions and highly pragmatic primary outcome analyses. Two 
studies (Michigan and California) used hospital employees rather than research staff to 
deliver the comparison condition and used no external procedures to verify participant 
compliance, which rendered these sites highly pragmatic on these dimensions.
Figure 1 depicts a color-coded PRECIS spoke and wheel diagram for all seven studies. 
Congruent with their low mean scores, Michigan and California displayed the most 
pragmatic diagrams and New York the most explanatory diagram. There was strong 
concurrence across all of the trials on the Primary Analysis dimension (individual site 
diagrams in Appendix). Interestingly, principal investigators tended to score their own trials 
as more explanatory, compared with the mean scores of other raters (data not shown).
Discussion
The CHART studies, similar to the smoking-cessation trial evaluated by Selby and 
colleagues,15 tended toward the pragmatic end of the spectrum, suggesting high applicability 
to clinical practice. Principal investigators tended to score their own studies as more 
explanatory, which differed from an earlier study, which found that principal investigators 
tended to rate their studies as more pragmatic compared with other raters.14 Three design 
features—what staff were used to deliver the interventions, strict following of study 
protocols, and aggressive follow-up of participants—tended toward ideal conditions rather 
than usual care conditions. These design domains represent good targets for research 
translation in the field of tobacco treatment studies. For example, instead of trained study 
counselors or even specialized hospital-based tobacco treatment staff, investigators could use 
existing clinical staff to apply interventions.
In addition, funding agencies and grant reviewers that seek to support more-pragmatic 
research will have to critically review their assumptions. Some of the more explanatory 
design features of CHART (such as training practitioners and assessing the fidelity of 
intervention delivery) were actually required by the request for applications. Funders who 
are crafting calls for proposals should consider using PRECIS criteria to evaluate their grant 
requirements and review criteria. When funding pragmatic trials is the goal, review panels

 should be trained in pragmatic trial design and reminded of those design features throughout 
the review process.
Limitations
Raters included investigators involved with the CHART studies—independent raters may 
have provided a more objective evaluation of the study designs. A next-generation measure
—PRECIS-2—was published in May 2015,16 midway through study analyses. It was not 
possible to switch rating tools. Although great deal of overlap exists between the original 
and newer PRECIS measures, future studies should use PRECIS-2.
Conclusions
The CHART trials included a number of pragmatic features but fell short of completely 
pragmatic designs on several key domains. In the future, highly pragmatic trials may 
routinely be conducted as a part of ongoing clinical care, facilitated by “learning healthcare 
systems” that can use clinical data to evaluate care innovations in real time.17 Until then, 
free-standing trials designed according to PRECIS-2 principles, as illustrated by Johnson et 
al.,18 can provide important models for how investigators who are aiming for highly 
applicable studies should design and conduct their own investigations.
