Abstract
Background
While noise annoyance has become recognized as an important environmental stressor, its
association to mental health has hardly been studied. We therefore determined the associa-
tion of noise annoyance to anxiety and depression and explored the contribution of diverse
environmental sources to overall noise annoyance.
Patients and Methods
We investigated cross-sectional data of n = 15.010 participants of the Gutenberg Health
Study (GHS), a population-based, prospective, single-center cohort study in Mid-Germany
(age 35 to 74 years). Noise annoyance was assessed separately for road traffic, aircraft,
railways, industrial, neighborhood indoor and outdoor noise (“during the day”; “in your
sleep”) on 5-point scales (“not at all” to “extremely”); depression and anxiety were assessed
by the PHQ-9, resp. GAD-2.
Results
Depression and anxiety increased with the degree of overall noise annoyance. Compared
to no annoyance, prevalence ratios for depression, respectively anxiety increased from
moderate (PR depression 1.20; 95%CI 1.00 to 1.45; PR anxiety 1.42; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.74)

1.71 to 2.67). Compared to other sources, aircraft noise annoyance was prominent affecting
almost 60% of the population.
Interpretation
Strong noise annoyance was associated with a two-fold higher prevalence of depression
and anxiety in the general population. While we could not relate annoyance due to aircraft
noise directly to depression and anxiety, we established that it was the major source of
annoyance in the sample, exceeding the other sources in those strongly annoyed. Prospec-
tive follow-up data will address the issue of causal relationships between annoyance and
mental health.
Introduction
Noise, defined as ‘unwanted sound’ has gradually become increasingly acknowledged as an
environmental stressor and as a nuisance [1]. Non-auditory effects of noise occur at levels far
below those required to damage the hearing organ. Although people tend to habituate to noise
exposure, the degree of habituation differs substantially between individuals and is rarely com-
plete. If exposure to noise is chronic and exceeds certain levels, adverse health outcomes can be
seen. Meanwhile numerous studies have shown that noise contributes to sleep disturbance, to
the development of arterial hypertension, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, arrhythmia,
metabolic syndrome and stroke (for review see [2]) and also to learning, respectively emotional
difficulties in children [3].
According to the noise reaction model, two principal pathways are relevant for the develop-
ment of adverse health effects of noise [4]. These refer to the ‘direct’ and the ‘indirect’ arousal
and activation of the organism. The ‘direct’ pathway is determined by the instantaneous inter-
action of the acoustic nerve with different structures of the central nervous system. The ‘indi-
rect’ pathway refers to the cognitive perception of the sound, its cortical activation and related
emotional responses such as annoyance. Both, noise level and noise annoyance have been
shown to be associated with cardiovascular disorders. Both reaction chains may initiate physio-
logical stress reactions. The activation of fight–flight and defeat reactions is thought to involve
subcortical regions of the brain like the hypothalamus, which has inputs to the autonomic ner-
vous system, the endocrine, and the limbic system. If experienced chronically, stress caused by
annoyance may even trigger the development of cardiovascular disease [2].
Annoyance is the most prevalent community response in a population exposed to environ-
mental noise. Noise annoyance can result from interference with daily activities, feelings,
thoughts, sleep, or rest, and may be accompanied by negative emotional responses, such as irri-
tability, distress, exhaustion, a wish to escape the noise and other stress-related symptoms [5,
6]. Severe annoyance has been associated with reduced well-being and health, and because of
the high number of people affected, annoyance contributes substantially to the burden of dis-
ease from environmental noise. It is estimated that DALYs (disability adjusted life years) from
environmental noise in the Western European countries are 61,000 years for ischemic heart
disease, 45,000 years for cognitive impairment for children, 903,000 for sleep disturbance,
22,000 years for tinnitus and 587,000 for annoyance solely http://www.euro.who.int/__data/

 While there is a clear relationship between the objective measurement of noise and annoy-
ance, individual factors such as noise sensitivity, internal states (genetic, physiological, psycho-
logical, life style) that increase individuals’ reactivity to noise in general [7] may play an
important role [8].
The burden of mental disorders is quite high and disabling. Depression and anxiety disor-
ders rank among the disorders with the strongest impact, as reflected by years lived with dis-
ability and reduced quality of life [9]. Comorbid somatic and mental disorders carry higher
burdens when compared to somatic disorders without mental comorbidities and mental disor-
ders without somatic comorbidities [10]. Central to most contemporary etiological theories is
the notion that stress can initiate cognitive and biological processes that increase the risk for
depression and for anxiety disorders [11]. Thus, it is surprising that the effect of noise on men-
tal health has so far been infrequently studied in adults.
In a cross-sectional survey of residential areas stratified by aircraft noise level, [6, 12],
annoyance was associated with an increase of noise level and with acute mental and physical
symptoms. However, chronic symptoms were higher in the areas with comparatively lower
noise level. Regardless of the level of noise, persons with high annoyance reported more mental
and physical symptoms and used more psychotropic drugs, general practice and outpatient ser-
vices [13]. In their review, van Kamp and Davies [7] concluded that individuals with mental
disorders constitute a risk group for heightened noise sensitivity (along with chronically
somatic ill, people suffering from tinnitus, shift workers, fetuses and neonates), which increases
their risk for adverse health effects of noise. Preliminary studies indicated different effects of
specific sources of traffic noise on attitudes and annoyance responses [14, 15]. In general, air-
craft noise has been found more annoying, and with stronger effects on sleep, than road and
railway noise [16]. In a large a population-based, prospective, observational single-center
cohort study in the Rhine-Main-Region in western Mid-Germany we recently studied a sample
of 15,010 participants drawn randomly from the local registry in the city of Mainz and the dis-
trict of Mainz-Bingen [17]. Some of these areas are affected by a direct neighborhood to the
Frankfurt Airport flight pattern; others are expected to be affected more by road traffic (e.g.
motorways) or railway noise. With the present studies we were specifically interested in the
relationship between noise annoyance and mental health by assessing total noise annoyance
during day and night. In a second step we wanted to differentiate between the sources of
extreme annoyance according to a broad range of sources (road, aircraft, train, industrial,
neighborhood, etc.).
The specific questions we wanted to address with the current studies were:
1. Is noise annoyance in general associated with anxiety and depression?
2. How annoying are different sources of noise?
Methods
Study sample
We investigated cross-sectional data of n = 15.010 participants enrolled in the Gutenberg
Health Study (GHS) from April 2007 to April 2012 [17]. The GHS is a population-based, pro-
spective, observational single-center cohort study in the Rhein-Main-Region in western Mid-
Germany. The study and its procedure have been approved by the ethics committee of the Stat-
utory Physician Board of the State of Rhineland-Palatinate and by the local and federal data
safety commissioners. Participation was voluntary and written informed consent was obtained
from each subject upon entry into the study. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate and

 improve cardiovascular risk stratification. The sample was drawn randomly from the local reg-
istry in the city of Mainz and the district of Mainz-Bingen. The sample was stratified 1:1 for
gender and residence and in equal strata for decades of age. Inclusion criteria were age 35 to 74
years and written informed consent. Persons with insufficient knowledge of German language,
or physical and mental inability to participate were excluded. Based on the interim analysis
5.8% were excluded because of the exclusion criteria. The response rate (defined as the recruit-
ment efficacy proportion, i.e. the number of persons with participation in or appointment for
the baseline examination divided by the sum of number of persons with participation in or
appointment for the baseline examination plus those with refusal and those who were not con-
tactable) was 60.3%. A total of 14.635 participants answered the noise annoyance items. Mean
age was 54.9 (±11.1); 49.4% were female.
Materials and assessment
The 5-hour baseline-examination in the study center comprised evaluation of prevalent classi-
cal cardiovascular risk factors and clinical variables, a computer-assisted personal interview,
laboratory examinations from a venous blood sample, blood pressure and anthropometric
measurements. In general, all examinations were performed according to standard operating
procedures by certified medical technical assistants
Questionnaires
Noise annoyance was assessed in analogy to Felscher-Suhr et. al. [18] by single questions in the
format: “How annoyed have you been in the past years by . . .”? Six potential sources of noise
annoyance (road traffic, aircraft, railways, industrial/construction, neighborhood indoor and
outdoor) were separately rated “during the day” and “in your sleep”. Ratings were done on a
five-point scale (“not, slightly, moderately, strongly, extremely”).
Depression was measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), which quantifies
the frequency of being bothered by each of the 9 diagnostic criteria of Major Depression over
the past 2 weeks. Responses are summed to create a score between 0 and 27 points. A PHQ-9
sum score of � 10 was used for the definition of caseness for depression yielding a sensitivity of
81% and a specificity of 82% for any depressive disorder[19].
Generalized anxiety was assessed with the two screening items of the short form of the
GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder [GAD]-7 Scale) [20]. On the GAD, subjects rated “Feel-
ing nervous, anxious or on edge” and “Not being able to stop or control worrying” by 0 = “not
at all”, 1 = “several days”, 2 = “over half the days”, and 3 = “nearly every day”. A sum score of 3
and more (range 0–6) out of these two items indicates generalized anxiety with good sensitivity
(86%) and specificity (83%). Both the GAD-7 and GAD-2 have been shown to perform well as
screening tools for all anxiety disorders [20].
Computer-assisted personal Interview
During the computer-assisted personal interview participants were asked whether they had
ever received the definite diagnosis of any depressive disorder (medical history of lifetime diag-
nosis of any depressive disorder, MH of Depression) by a physician. The socioeconomic status
(SES) was defined according to Lampert’s and Kroll’s scores with a range from 3 to 27 (3 indi-
cates the lowest SES and 27 the highest SES) [21].

 Statistical analysis
Variables were reported as absolute numbers, percentages or means with standard deviations
or medians with 25th and 75th percentiles as appropriate. As we were interested in total noise
annoyance, we used the highest annoyance rating of all categories of noise (aircraft, road traffic,
etc.) as an indicator of overall noise annoyance, regardless of whether it affected daytime or
sleep. Comparisons between groups were done with Cochran-Armitage test for trend for cate-
gorical variables and with Jonckheere-Terpstra test for continuous variables as appropriate. To
investigate the association between overall annoyance and depression (PHQ-9 �10), respec-
tively generalized anxiety (GAD-2 �3) multiple generalized linear models with a binominal
distribution and a log link function adjusted for sex, age and socioeconomic status were used.
All reported p-values corresponded to 2-tailed tests. As this is an explorative study no adjust-
ments for multiple testing have been done. P-values were given for descriptive reasons only.
Due to the large number of tests, p-values should be interpreted with caution and in connection
with effect estimates. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS for Windows 9.4 TS Level
1M1 (SAS Institute Inc.) Cary, NC, USA.
Results
Table 1 shows depression and anxiety according to degree of noise annoyance. Of the study
participants, 20.7% reported no, 26.6% slight, 25.0% moderate, 17.3% strong, 10.5% extreme
annoyance by noise. Mean depression and anxiety scores increased steadily from 3.5 to 5.1,
respectively 0.7 to 1.1, with the degree of annoyance. The rates of clinically significant anxiety
(GAD-2�3) and depression (PHQ-9�10) and medical diagnoses of depression, respectively
anxiety, also increased steadily.
In order to determine the associations between noise annoyance, depression and anxiety,
we performed a logistic regression controlling for sex, age and socioeconomic status (Fig 1).
Compared to no annoyance, the odds ratio for depression increased steadily starting from
moderate (1.22; 95%CI 1.00 to 1.49) to extreme annoyance, which had a 2.12 fold (95%CI 1.71
to 2.64) likelihood of depression. Correspondingly, the likelihood of anxiety increased from
moderate (1.45fold; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.81) to extreme annoyance (2.28 fold; 95% CI 1.79 to
2.91).
As Fig 2 shows, the degree of annoyance was highest due to aircraft noise (affecting 59.9%
of the population to some degree and 6.4% extremely), followed by road traffic (43.5%; 1.9%),

trial noise (19.6%/ 0.9%).
Fig 3 summarizes the sources of extreme noise annoyance. Clearly, aircraft noise has turned
out the leading source with over 60%, followed by road traffic (18.1%), neighborhood (out-
door), industrial, neighborhood (indoor) and railway noise.
Discussion
The present study shows that the degree of noise annoyance reported by people living in the
vicinity of the Frankfurt Airport and taking part in the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS) is
strongly associated with the degree of depression and anxiety. Compared to other sources,
annoyance by aircraft noise was prominent affecting almost 60% of the population and also
accounted mostly for extreme degrees of annoyance. The vast majority of the large population-
based sample reported noise annoyance; only 20.7% reported no annoyance. More than half
(52.8%) of the population were at least moderately annoyed. Importantly, by adjusting for age,
sex and socioeconomic status we could rule out possible demographic effects or effects of noisy
low-socioeconomic environments.
When we looked at the sources of annoyance, the majority of participants reported annoy-
ance due to aircraft, which exceeded all other sources of noise. Aircraft noise has also turned

 out as the leading source of extreme annoyance (with over 60%), followed by road traffic,
neighborhood (outdoor), industrial, neighborhood (indoor) and railway noise. With respect to
aircraft but not road traffic noise, there has been a substantial increase in annoyance reactions
over the years at the same intensity of noise [5]. Babisch et al. recently demonstrated that
annoyance ratings in the HYENA study were clearly higher than predicted by the EU standard
curves [5].
Anxiety and depression belong to the most frequent and impairing conditions in the com-
munity; the 12-month prevalence of anxiety disorders was 14.0% and major depressive disor-
ders afflicted 6.9% in Europe according to large epidemiological studies. Nearly one in four
women and one in six men experience depression during their lifetime. Nearly twice the num-
ber of women reported anxiety disorders or depression compared to men. Living alone, a lower
educational level, and a low socioeconomic status have been identified as risk factors for anxi-
ety disorders and depression [10].
Occupational noise and depression have been studied most intensely, e.g. a large recent
Korean survey by Yoon et al. [22] found that occupational noise annoyance was strongly asso-
ciated to depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in men and women (odds ratios OR 1.41
to 1.76). An Egyptian study of airport workers found hearing impairment, raised blood pres-
sure, headaches, disturbed sleep, and symptoms of anxiety were more prominent among the
noise exposed workers than the controls [23].
Findings regarding traffic noise, depression and anxiety are rather limited and somewhat
controversial. In one study the association between traffic noise and depression was due to the
link between noisy, low-socio-demographic environments and mental health [24]; other stud-
ies [6, 12, 13] found that the association between noise and mental symptoms was mediated by
annoyance, respectively noise sensitivity [7]. A large, recent Danish study by Roswall et al.
found that calculated residential exposure to road traffic and railway noise had significant, but
small negative effects on quality of life [25].
Regarding aircraft noise, indirect evidence for a potential negative effect on mental health,
respectively sleep was provided by Floud et al. [26] Aircraft noise during the day (OR = 1.28)
and the night (OR = 1.27) was significantly associated with the intake of anxiolytics; the effects
for annoyance were considerably stronger (OR = 1.78; OR = 1.77) [26]. The intake of antide-
pressants was only increased by noise annoyance at night (OR = 1.59) [26]. Based on health
insurance data, the large case control study [27] found an increased likelihood of inpatient

 treatment for depression in women (neither for men nor anxiety disorders) exposed to inten-
sive night time aircraft noise; the same applied to the intake of antidepressants. A small case
control study by Hardoy et al. [28] showed an increased risk for long-lasting syndromal anxiety
states (Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Anxiety Disorder NOS) in participants exposed to
aircraft noise.
As in the international literature, substantial proportions of the population were afflicted
with depression (6.6%) and anxiety disorders (7.3%). Previous medical diagnoses of depression
were reported by a total of 12.0%; medical diagnoses of anxiety disorder by 7.3%. According to
our findings, the intensity of depression and anxiety, and also the proportions of medical diag-
noses of depression, respectively anxiety increased with noise annoyance.
Importantly, the magnitude of the association between noise and depression/anxiety was
comparable to the previously reported association of depression with coronary heart disease [2,
29–31]. Thus, in addition to direct negative cardiovascular effects of noise [2, 29–31] it is
tempting to speculate there might be some indirect adverse effect of noise in inducing cardio-
vascular disease via causing depression and anxiety disorders.
More than half (52.8%) of the population were at least moderately annoyed and thus at an
increased risk for depression and for generalized anxiety; the intensity of the risk increased
steadily with the degree of annoyance amounting to a more than two-fold risk (2.12 for depres-
sion, 2.28 for generalized anxiety) at the level of extreme annoyance.
The demonstration of an association of noise annoyance with current depression and anxi-
ety disorder is compatible with the hypothesis that annoyance induces stress, which in turn
may precipitate or even worsen already existing depression and anxiety disorders. However,
given the cross-sectional nature of our study and previous findings [6, 12, 13] we cannot pre-
clude that depression, respectively anxiety disorders may also indicate a heightened noise sensi-
tivity. Thus, existing mental disease may deteriorate due to noise [7]. As anxiety and
depression are among the most frequent and burdening diseases in the general population,
substantial parts of the population may thus be particularly vulnerable to environmental noise.
Alternatively, increased annoyance may be a symptom of depression and anxiety related to the
increased irritability sometimes found in these conditions or to the negativity to one's sur-
roundings found in depression.
Strengths of our study are the large sample size of over 15.000 residents and the representa-
tive nature of the sample. While previous surveys usually assessed one or two kinds of noise
(e.g. road, air traffic or occupational), we were able to cover a broad range of sources including
neighborhood noise indoors and outdoors, and we were able to adjust for socio economic sta-
tus. Limitations of the study refer to the age range (35 to 74 years) and the participation rate.
Noise annoyance may be lower in younger people [7]. Further analyses will help to specify the
contributions of specific sources of noise to annoyance during the day and in the sleep. The
focus of this paper was on subjective annoyance, and we could not relate it to objective mea-
sures of noise exposition. Based on the cross-sectional nature of our data we cannot make
causal statements on the relationship of annoyance to mental health, i.e. participants with men-
tal health problems may be more noise sensitive and report higher annoyance [7]. We expect
further clarification of these issues from our regular follow-up assessments of the 15,000
included cohort subjects in order to address the issue of causal relationships between annoy-
ance and mental health.
