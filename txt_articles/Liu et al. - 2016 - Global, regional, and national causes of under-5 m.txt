2000–15: an updated systematic analysis with implications 
for the Sustainable Development Goals

Summary
Background Despite remarkable progress in the improvement of child survival between 1990 and 2015, the Millennium 
Development Goal (MDG) 4 target of a two-thirds reduction of under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) was not achieved 
globally. In this paper, we updated our annual estimates of child mortality by cause to 2000–15 to reflect on progress 
toward the MDG 4 and consider implications for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target for child survival.
Methods We increased the estimation input data for causes of deaths by 43% among neonates and 23% among 
1–59-month-olds, respectively. We used adequate vital registration (VR) data where available, and modelled cause-specific 
mortality fractions applying multinomial logistic regressions using adequate VR for low U5MR countries and verbal 
autopsy data for high U5MR countries. We updated the estimation to use Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate in place of 
malaria index in the modelling of malaria deaths; to use adjusted empirical estimates instead of modelled estimates for 
China; and to consider the effects of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and rotavirus vaccine in the estimation.
Findings In 2015, among the 5·9 million under-5 deaths, 2·7 million occurred in the neonatal period. The leading 
under-5 causes were preterm birth complications (1·055 million [95% uncertainty range (UR) 0·935–1·179]), 
pneumonia (0·921 million [0·812 –1·117]), and intrapartum-related events (0·691 million [0·598 –0·778]). In the two 
MDG regions with the most under-5 deaths, the leading cause was pneumonia in sub-Saharan Africa and preterm 
birth complications in southern Asia. Reductions in mortality rates for pneumonia, diarrhoea, neonatal intrapartum-
related events, malaria, and measles were responsible for 61% of the total reduction of 35 per 1000 livebirths in U5MR 
in 2000–15. Stratified by U5MR, pneumonia was the leading cause in countries with very high U5MR. Preterm birth 
complications and pneumonia were both important in high, medium high, and medium child mortality countries; 
whereas congenital abnormalities was the most important cause in countries with low and very low U5MR.
Interpretation In the SDG era, countries are advised to prioritise child survival policy and programmes based on their 
child cause-of-death composition. Continued and enhanced efforts to scale up proven life-saving interventions are 
needed to achieve the SDG child survival target.

Introduction
The year 2015 marks the end of the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs) era, during which the 
under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) reduced by an impressive 
53% globally, although still falling short of the MDG 4 
target of a two-thirds reduction from 1990 to 2015.1,2 
Year 2016 marks the beginning of the implementation 
of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).3 The 
SDGs target an U5MR of no more than 25 per 1000 
livebirths in every country of the world in 2030.4 To plan 
how to eliminate preventable child deaths, information is 
needed about the current distribution of causes of child 
deaths and this has changed in recent decades. In this 
paper, we update our annual estimates of child mortality 
by cause to 2000–15; reflect on progress toward the 
MDG 4; and consider the implications for national and 
global priorities if the SDG target for child survival is to 
be achieved.
Methods
General estimation approaches 
We estimated the number of child deaths by cause for 
each of the 194 WHO member states for each year in 
2000–15. This was done separately for neonates and 
children aged 1–59 months. The number of child deaths 
by cause was estimated as the product of the number of 
age-specific deaths due to all causes and age-specific and 
cause-specific mortality fractions. The age-specific all-
cause death estimates were derived from age-specific 
child mortality estimates produced by the UN Inter-
Agency 
Group 
for 
Child 
Mortality 
Estimation 
(UN-IGME).5 The livebirth estimates were produced by 
the UN Population Division.6
To generate cause-specific mortality fractions (CSMFs) 
for neonates and 1-59-month–olds, we applied our 
estimation framework with updates.7 The estimation 
framework comprises three components. Component

one covers countries with adequate vital registration (VR) 
(67 for neonates, 69 for 1–59-month-olds) for which we 
used CSMFs derived from the country-specific VR data 
as is or with minor adjustments.8 Component two covers 
countries with inadequate VR and low U5MR 
(<35 per 1000 livebirths in 2000–15; 47 for neonates and 
44 for 1–59-month-olds). For these countries, we 
modelled CSMFs using a multinomial logistic regression 
(MLR) applied to input CSMFs calculated from number 
of deaths by cause from VR countries (ie, component 
one) and their distal (eg, socioeconomic indicators) and 
proximate 
(eg, 
childhood 
life-saving 
intervention 
coverage values) determinates of child survival as model 
inputs.9 Component two is referred to as a VR based 
multicause model or VRMCM. Component three is for 
countries with inadequate VR and high U5MR 
(≥35 per 1000 livebirths in 2000–15; 80 for neonates and 
81 for 1–59-month-olds). For these countries, we 
modelled CSMFs using MLR with empirical input 
CSMFs calculated from number of deaths by cause 
extracted from verbal autopsy (VA) studies and primarily 
proximate determinants as model inputs. Component 
three is referred to as a VA based multicause model or 
VAMCM. Details of the estimation framework including 
the use of MLR and information on the standard 
International Classification of Diseases codes by cause 
have been published elsewhere.7,8 The distal and 
proximate determinants used as model inputs are listed 
in the appendix (p 5).
We updated our database to include new VR data 
reported to WHO up to July 30, 2015, and new VA data 
identified through an updated systematic review of 
literature published between Jan 1, 2013, and Feb 12, 2015 
(table 1; appendix p 3). Despite completing the systematic 
review in 2015, our estimates for year 2015 were intended 
to cover the entire year. In total, the input number of 
deaths 
increased 
by 
43·0% 
for 
neonates 
(from 
2·629 million to 3·760 million) and 22·7% for children 
aged 1–59 months (from 3·312 million to 4·063 million). 
For China, we replaced modelled estimates10 with adjusted 
empirical estimates from the China Maternal and Child 
Health Surveillance System (MCHSS), the details of which 
can be found elsewhere.11 A summary map of input data 
and estimation methods is presented in the appendix (p 3).
Updates on estimation methods
A few methodological updates are shown here. First, we 
used the Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate (PfPR)12 in 
place of the more subjective malaria index8 as one of the 
candidate covariates to model the fraction of deaths due to 
malaria in countries with high transmission intensity. 
PfPR is the proportion of the population carrying asexual 
blood-stage parasites and is considered as an indicator of 
malaria transmission intensity (appendix p 4). In the 
VAMCM, we used post-hoc adjustment to consider the 
effects of recently scaled up interventions, which 
previously included insecticide treated bed nets (ITN). 
Since PfPR reflects the impact of ITN,12 we dropped ITN 
from the post-hoc adjustment. Second, we considered the 
impacts of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine13,14 and 
rotavirus vaccine,15 in addition to the previously included 
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine in the post-
hoc adjustment. Specifically, we calculated pneumonia-
specific, meningitis-specific, and diarrhoea-specific deaths 
averted due to each of these vaccines in the post-hoc 
adjustment and redistributed the cause-specific deaths 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Our study group, formerly referred to as the WHO and UNICEF’s 
Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group (CHERG), has 
systematically reviewed, estimated, and published a series of child 
mortality by cause estimates since 2003, with the last publication 
presenting estimates for years 2000–13. To collect data published 
since 2013, we did an updated systematic review to identify 
quality child cause-of-death studies published between Jan 1, 
2013, and Feb 12, 2015 in the following databases: PubMed, 
Embase, ISIS Web of Knowledge, Medline BIOSIS, Popline, WHOLIS 
(via Global Health Library, including the regional specific databases 
of LILACs, African Index Medicus, WPRIM, IMEMR, and PAHO) and 
IndMed without language limitation. Search strategies, search 
terms, and study inclusion and exclusion criteria were consistent 
with our previous studies. Other investigators have estimated 
distribution of mortality by cause among all age groups.
Added value of this study
In this paper, we updated the estimates from years 2000–13 to 
2000–15 to reflect on the progress toward the MDG 4 and draw 
implications for the SDG child survival target. Our updates are 
based on substantially more input data and several important 
methodological advances, including using adjusted empirical 
instead of modelled child cause-of-death estimates for China 
for the first time.
Implications of all the available evidence
Estimates presented here are the most up-to-date, and likely 
thus far the most valid ones of child mortality by cause at the 
global, regional, and national levels. Such information can and 
should be used to inform child survival policy making and 
resource allocation. Future research should further consider 
how to best incorporate increasing national empirical estimates 
and balance between empirical and modelled estimates. 
Continued investment in child cause-of-death data collection 
and estimation applying innovative approaches will further 
improve validity of such important information.

averted to the remaining causes pro rata. The cause-
specific deaths averted were calculated as the product of 
the following four quantities: 1) cause-specific deaths 
estimated by VAMCM before post-hoc adjustment, 2) the 
fractions due to vaccine-specific serotypes, 3) vaccine 
coverage, and 4) vaccine effectiveness, where available, or 
efficacy. Details of the parameters used in the post-hoc 
adjustment are available in the appendix (p 7). Lastly, a 
7-year moving-average smoother was applied to the 
national-level prediction covariates used in the VAMCM 
to attenuate implausible spikes due to systematic errors in 
measurement or inconsistencies in covariate definitions.
Model selection and uncertainty estimation
We selected the final model by cross validation. 
Specifically, we selected 10% of the observed cause-of-
death data points, and fit each of the candidate models 
using the remaining 90%. We then predicted the CSMFs 
in the withheld selection, and determined the difference 
between the observed and predicted estimates. We 
repeated this process with 500 random subsets. We 
selected as final the model with the smallest average out 
of sample prediction error.13,16
We estimated uncertainty in model coefficients by 
bootstrap resampling of input data sets from all 
estimation components and their respective distributions. 
This uncertainty was propagated through to the model 
predictions.13,17 
Uncertainty 
in 
the 
estimates 
of 
under-5 and neonatal deaths was also included using the 
UN-IGME methodology.1 We also accounted for potential 
variability due to post-hoc adjustment and the modelled 
number of deaths due to measles, pertussis, HIV, and 
malaria outside of sub-Saharan Africa. The 2·5 and 
97·5 percentiles were taken as the lower and upper 
ranges of the uncertainty.
Estimates reporting
Estimates of deaths in the 1–59 month period due to 
preterm birth complications, intrapartum-related events, 
and congenital abnormalities were produced previously, 
but were collapsed into the category of other. They are 
reported separately here. Notably, the number of deaths 
due to, for example, congenital abnormalities among 
under-5 is then the sum of the numbers of deaths due to 
congenital 
abnormalities 
among 
neonates 
and 
1–59-month-olds. Other conditions among children aged 
1–59 months include causes originated during the 
perinatal period, cancer, severe malnutrition, and other 
specified causes.
Since we estimated child mortality by cause for 2000–15 
but not for 1990–99, we were not able to assess cause-
specific progress toward the MDG 4 for the entire period 
of 1990–2015. However, we can benchmark cause-specific 
progress in 2000–15 with the 4·4% average annual rate of 
reduction (ARR) required to achieve the MDG 4.8,18 We 
also present the aggregated cause-of-death profile by six 
U5MR strata using the 2015 estimates with the cutoffs of 
10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 per 1000 livebirths, referred to as 
very low, low, medium, medium high, high, and very high 
mortality strata, respectively.1
To promote transparency and replicability of global 
health estimates, we have also included the GATHER 
reporting checklist in the appendix (p 9).19 Additional 
details of the input data, estimation methodology 
including statistical codes, and estimates are online and 
publicly available through the Maternal and Child 
Epidemiology Estimation’s website.

Results
In 2015, among the 5·942 million children who did not 
live to age 5 years, 2·681 million (45·1%) died in the 
neonatal period (figure 1). The leading causes of deaths 
in children under 5 were preterm birth complications 
(1·055 
million 
[95% 
UR 
0·935–1·179]; 
17·8% 
[UR 
15·4–19·0]), 
pneumonia 
(0·920 
million 
[0·812–1·117], 15·5%  [13·9–17·6]), and intrapartum-
related events (0·691 million [0·598–0·778], 11·6% 
[9·9–12·7]; table 2). Among neonates, the leading causes 
were preterm birth complications (0·944 million 
[UR 0·832–1·066], 15·9% [UR 13·8–17·3]), intrapartum 
related events (0·637 million [0·550–0·723], 10·7% 
[9·2–11·8]), and sepsis or meningitis (0·401 million 
[0·280–0·522], 6·8%  [4·7–8·6]). Among children who 
died in the 1-59-month period, the leading causes were 
pneumonia (0·762 million [UR 0·651–0·943], 12·8% 
 
[UR 11·5–14·6]), diarrhoea (0·509 million [0·401–0·661], 
8·6% 
[7·0–10·2]), 
and 
injuries 
(0·327 
million 
[0·272–0·410], 5·5% [4·6–6·3]).
Sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia remained the 
MDG regions with the highest numbers of under-5 
deaths in 2015 (2·947 million and 1·891 million, 
respectively). The distribution of under-5 deaths by cause 
differed substantially by region (appendix p 11). For 
example, in sub-Saharan Africa, the leading causes of 
under-5 deaths were pneumonia (0·490 million [UR 
0·417–0·631], 16·6% [UR 14·8–19·1]), preterm birth 
complications (0·356 million [0·283–0·433], 12·1% 
[9·3–13·6]), and intrapartum-related events (0·338 
million [0·278–0·397], 11·5% [9·0–12·3]). Southern Asia, 
however, had a higher fraction of neonatal deaths 
(57·0%), with preterm birth complications being the 
leading cause (0·478 million [0·394–0·552], 25·3% 
[21·7–28·7]).
Among the 194 countries estimated, the number of 
under-5 deaths varied between 1 death and 1·201 million 
deaths in 2015. The ten countries with the highest number 
of under-5 deaths were collectively responsible for three-
fifths (60·4%, 3·587 million) of the global under-5 deaths. 
Their cause composition is presented in the appendix 
(p 12). The share of neonatal deaths in these countries 
varied from 30·9% (0·094 of 0·305 million in DR Congo) 
to 62·3% (0·074 of 0·119 million in Bangladesh). The 
leading cause among under-5s was pneumonia in Angola 
(0·029 million [UR 0·011–0·064], 17·4% [UR 13·8–21·9]), 
DR 
Congo 
(0·046 
million 
[0·026–0·074], 
15·2% 
[12·8–17·9]), Ethiopia (0·031 million [0·012–0·060], 17·1% 
[14·2–20·7]), Nigeria (0·133 million [0·087–0·209], 17·8% 
[15·9–20·6]), and Tanzania (0·014 million [0·007–0·028], 
14·6% [12·8–17·5]). All of these countries are in 
sub-Saharan Africa. The leading cause was preterm 
birth complications in Bangladesh (0·024 million 
[UR 0·018–0·031], 19·8%  [UR 15·6–24·0]), Indonesia 
(0·028 million [0·023–0·038], 18·9% [16·3–23·3]), India 
(0·330 million [0·269–0·387], 27·5% [23·4–31·5]), and 
Pakistan (0·102 million [0·071–0·137], 23·6% [18·4–28·7]). 
Most of these countries are in southern Asia. The leading 
cause was congenital abnormalities in China (0·036 million 
[UR 0·034–0·039], 19·7% [UR 18·0–21·5]). Malaria was an 
important cause in DR Congo and Nigeria, responsible for 
0·036 million ([UR 0·017–0·062; 11·9% [UR 8·2–16·5]) 
and 0·102 million ([0·056–0·186]; 13·6% [10·2–17·8]) 
deaths, respectively.
The risk of dying in the first 5 years, the U5MR, ranged 
between 1·9 and 155·1 per 1000 livebirths among the 
194 countries in 2015. The ten countries with the highest 
U5MR are all in sub-Saharan Africa and had U5MRs 
above 90 per 1000 livebirths. Three of these ten countries 
(Angola, Nigeria, and DR Congo) are among the ten 
countries with the most under-5 deaths mentioned 
above. In the remaining seven countries, the leading 
cause among under-5s was pneumonia in Benin, Central 
African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Somalia, and Chad, 
and malaria in Mali and Sierra Leone (appendix p 13).

Additional estimates of country-specific and cause-
specific numbers of deaths are available in the appendix 
(p 14).
Globally, more than 4 million (4·020 million) fewer 
under-5 deaths occurred in 2015 compared with in 2000. 
During this period, causes of child deaths changed 
gradually at the global level (appendix p 45). Although 
pneumonia and preterm birth complications were also 
leading causes of under-5 deaths in 2000 (1·738 million 
[UR 
1·654–1·997]; 
17·4% 
[UR 
16·0–19·3] 
and 
1·339 [1·169–1·464]; 13·4% [11·6–14·2], respectively), 
diarrhoea was replaced as the third leading cause in 2000 
(1·213 million [1·115–1·451], 12·2% [11·0–14·3]) by 
intrapartum-related events in 2015. U5MR declined from 
77·8 to 42·5 per 1000 livebirths over this period. Mortality 
rates for pneumonia, diarrhoea, neonatal intrapartum 
related events, malaria, and measles all reduced by more 
than 30% (figure 2). Collectively, reductions in these 
causes (21·7 less deaths per 1000 livebirths) were 
responsible for 61·6% of the total reduction in U5MR 
(35·3 less deaths per 1000 livebirths) in 2000–15.
The global ARR of U5MR in 2000–15 was 4·0%, below 
the 4·4% required to achieve the MDG 4 in 1990–2015. 
All-cause neonatal mortality has been declining at a 
slower rate than that of children aged 1–59 months, at 
3·1% versus 4·7% respectively. As a result, the fraction of 
neonatal deaths increased from 39·3% in 2000 to 45·1% 
in 2015. Nine causes achieved an ARR of at least 4·4% 
since 2000, with ARRs ranging from 13·1% [UR 6·8–16·1] 
for measles to 4·6% [3·4–5·4] for neonatal pneumonia 
(appendix p 46). By comparison, neonatal mortality due 
to congenital abnormalities only declined by 0·8% per 
year (UR 0·1–2·0).
Among the ten MDG regions, eastern Asia, which is 
composed mainly of China, saw the fastest reduction in 
U5MR in 2000–15 at an ARR of 8·2%. Mortality rates of 
almost all causes in this region have declined by 
at least 70% from 37·1 to 10·8 per 1000 livebirths 
(appendix 
p 
49). 
The 
cause 
composition 
also 
changed, with congenital abnormalities (0·038 million 
[UR 0·036–0·041], 19·3% [UR 17·8–21·0]) and injuries 
(0·028 [0·027–0·030], 14·2% [13·0–15·3]) replacing 
pneumonia (0·024 [0·022–0·026], 20·1% [18·1–22·3]) 
and 
intrapartum-related 
events 
(0·028 
million 
[0·023–0·030], 15·7% [14·2–17·3]) as the leading causes 
among under-5s in 2015 (appendix p 59). In sub-Saharan 
Africa, malaria, diarrhoea, and measles among children 
aged 
1–59 
months 
saw 
substantial 
reductions, 
contributing 18, 13, and 11 per 1000 livebirths to the 
reduction of U5MR, respectively (appendix p 55). The 
leading cause changed from malaria (0·699 million 
[UR 0·612–0·960], 16·4% [UR 13·5–20·7]%) in 2000 to 
pneumonia 
(0·490 
million 
[0·417–0·631], 
16·6% 
[14·8–19·1]%) in 2015 (appendix p 65). In southern Asia, 
U5MR due to preterm birth complications have only 
been declining at an ARR of 1·4% per annum 
(UR –0·3 to 2·2), a rate slower than the regional ARR of 
U5MR at 3·8%. As a result, the contribution of preterm 
birth complications to under-5 deaths has increased from 
16·7% (UR [14·2–18·6], 0·598 million [0·497–0·664]) in 
2000 to 25·3% ([21·7–28·7], 0·478 million [0·394–0·552]) 
in 2015. Despite a faster decline at an ARR of 5·4% 
[UR 3·7–7·3], pneumonia remained one of the leading 
killers of under-5 children in southern Asia, responsible 
for 
0·687 
million 
(0·626–0·771) 
deaths 
(19·2% 
[UR 17·7–21·6]) in 2000 and 0·285 million (0·215–0·372) 
deaths (15·1% [13·4–17·4]) in 2015. Additional regional 
and national trends can be viewed in the appendix (p 14).
Figure 3 shows the CSMFs and cause-specific mortality 
rates by six U5MR strata in 2015. Seven (Angola, Central 
African Republic, Chad, Mali, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and 
Somalia) of the 194 countries fell in the very high mortality 
stratum. Collectively, they were responsible for a fifth 
(20·1%, 1·193 million of 5·942 million) of global under-5 
deaths in 2015. Pneumonia, malaria, and diarrhoea were 
the leading causes in this stratum. The high, medium 
high, and medium strata each included 17, 20, and 
36 countries. They were responsible for about a quarter 
(23·7%), a tenth (11·0%), and a third (34·9%) of global 
under-5 deaths in 2015, respectively. The leading causes in 
these three strata were very similar, being preterm birth 
complications, pneumonia, and intrapartum-related 
events. 54 countries were in the low mortality stratum. 
They contributed to 9% of the world’s under-5 deaths. 
Their leading causes were congenital abnormalities, 
preterm 
birth 
complications, 
pneumonia, 
and 
intrapartum-related events. Another 60 countries fell in 
the very low mortality strata, responsible for 2% of the 
global under-5 deaths. The leading causes in this stratum

were 
congenital 
abnormalities, 
preterm 
birth 
complications, and injuries. When moving from the very 
low to the very high mortality strata, the fractions and 
mortality rates of pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malaria 
increase. By contrast, the fractions of congenital 
abnormalities decrease, although its mortality rate is still 
the lowest in the very low mortality stratum (figure 3B).
Discussion
Child survival has improved substantially in the MDG 
era even though the targeted two-thirds reduction was 
not achieved.1,20 This progress has been partly credited to 
the establishment of the MDGs, the ensuing increase in 
official development assistance, and the consequential 
scaling up of many life-saving interventions.20–22 However, 
the progress has been uneven and high levels of child 
mortality persist in many countries.
In regard to cause-specific pace of reduction in 2000–15, 
measles and neonatal tetanus have seen tremendous 
progress, as have major causes such as diarrhoea and 
pneumonia though to a lesser degree. Injuries, neonatal 
preterm birth complications, neonatal intrapartum-
related events, neonatal congenital abnormalities, and 
neonatal sepsis or meningitis are major causes among 
those with insufficient decline (ARR <4·4%) in 2000–15. 
To achieve the SDG child survival target, substantial 
progress is needed for these causes.
Neonatal mortality has declined more slowly than that 
of the 1–59-month-olds. If neonatal causes had been 
declining at a rate achieved by the 1–59 month age group, 
the world would have attained the MDG 4 target ahead of 
time. Eastern Asia is an exception in that it managed to 
achieve faster decline among neonates than among older 
children. Case studies are valuable on how eastern Asia, 
primarily China, has achieved an impressive and balanced 
decline across age groups and causes.11 By contrast, sub-
Saharan Africa had the largest disparity in progress 
between the two age groups, with neonatal survival only 
having been improving at an ARR of less than half of that 
of the 1–59 month age group. Five of the 12 post-neonatal 
causes achieved an ARR of at least 4·4%, yet only two of 
the eight neonatal causes did in this region.
Focusing on the high-burden regions, sub-Saharan 
African countries had a quarter of the world’s livebirths 
in 2015.6 This figure is projected to increase to a third in 
2030.6 Ensuring family planning needs of adolescent 
girls, women, and couples are satisfied with modern 
contraception is a key to reduce the number of child 
deaths in this region and globally in the next 15 years.21 
Major infectious causes in sub-Saharan Africa had 
reductions in 2000–15, but infectious causes such as 
pneumonia, 
diarrhoea, 
malaria, 
and 
sepsis 
or 
meningitis remain important and should be a focus of 
child survival efforts going forward. Many neonatal 
causes and injuries have been declining more slowly in 
this region and interventions should be enhanced to 
address these conditions. In southern Asia, the 
contributions of preterm birth complications and 
congenital abnormalities to under-5 deaths have 
increased substantially in 2000–15. A major focus of 
child survival programmes in this region has to be on 
neonatal causes.

Out of equity considerations, the SDG child survival 
target calls on all countries to reduce U5MR to 25 per 
1000 livebirths or below by 2030. Country strategy 
formulation should consider their current U5MR and 
cause-of-death profile. When prioritising by child mortality 
strata, for the very high mortality countries, the focus 
should still be on the leading infectious causes, such as 
pneumonia, malaria, and diarrhoea. All of these can be 
addressed by highly effective and low cost preventive and 
therapeutic 
interventions, 
such 
as 
breastfeeding 
promotion, and Haemophilus influenzae type b and 
pneumococcal vaccines for pneumonia,23 improved water 
and sanitation, rotavirus vaccine, zinc supplementation, 
oral 
rehydration 
solutions, 
and 
community 
case 
management for diarrhoea,23 and insecticide treated bed-
nets, intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy, and 
artemisinin-based combination therapy for malaria.24 In 
addition, recent approval of a malaria vaccine holds 
potential for further malaria reduction, although major 
challenges exist for vaccine schedules.25
Among countries with high, medium high, and medium 
child mortality, a clear child survival policy and programme 
focus should be to further invest in reducing deaths due to 
preterm 
birth 
complications, 
pneumonia, 
and 
intrapartum-related events. Relevant interventions for 
pneumonia are described above. Improved labour and 
delivery management is also important to reduce the 
causes of neonatal deaths.26 Antenatal corticosteroids and 
Kangaroo mother care are among the major recommended 
interventions to improve preterm birth outcomes.27 
Neonatal resuscitation and comprehensive emergency 
obstetric care are among those recommended to reduce 
deaths due to intrapartum-related events.28–30
114 countries already have an U5MR of no more than 
25 per 1000 livebirths in 2015.1 Effectively, they have 
achieved the SDG child survival target. However, this 
does not mean that they have homogeneous child cause-
of-death profiles. Different from their higher mortality 
peers, countries in the low mortality stratum have 
congenital abnormalities as the leading cause. Clearly, 
congenital abnormalities should receive special attention 
in this stratum. Reducing the burden of congenital 
abnormalities will require better detection of some 
conditions and surgery for many. In addition to preterm 
birth complications and intrapartum-related events, 
pneumonia is still relatively important among low 
mortality countries compared with their very low 
mortality counterparts.
For countries in the very low mortality stratum, there is 
still room for improvement. Rapid reductions were seen 
between 2000 and 2015 for countries in this mortality 
stratum. For example, Portugal and Czech Republic had 
an U5MR around seven per 1000 livebirths in 2000. They 
both achieved an ARR of 4·5% for U5MR in 2000–15. 
Cause wise, they both had an accelerated decline, for 
example, in neonatal intrapartum-related events, which 
could be due to improved delivery care. These set 
examples for countries with very low child mortality to 
achieve rapid cause-specific reduction. In addition to 
congenital 
abnormalities, 
injuries 
also 
become 
increasingly important in this stratum. More rigorous 
research is needed to understand the epidemiology and 
effectiveness of injury interventions, such as barriers to 
prevent drowning, safer stoves to prevent burns, and car 
seats to prevent road traffic injury.31 Coordination 
and cooperation across sectors are essential. Injuries 
and other childhood conditions in settings of conflict and 
humanitarian crisis, such as Syria, should be a priority 
for global assistance.32
In addition to newly implemented vaccines, other new 
interventions could bear the potential to further improve 
child survival. New WHO guidelines on antibiotic 
management of neonatal infections have been released 
based on the results of the Simplified Antibiotic Therapy 
Trial.33–36 These guidelines could further encourage 
community treatment and reduce mortality from 
neonatal infections. Based on preliminary results from 
the Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment study, 
which was done among adults,37 WHO revised its HIV 
treatment recommendation to “treat-all”, that is to treat 
anyone living with HIV with antiretroviral as soon as 
possible and to offer people at high risk with preventive 
antiretrovirals.38 This strategy could further avert under-5 
HIV
/AIDS deaths, although more evidence for children 
is needed. During the scale-up of antiretroviral treatment, 
precautions need be exercised to ensure that existing 
childhood interventions are not crowded out.39
We warn against attributing reductions of child cause-
specific mortality rates to covariates used in our 
estimation due to circularity. For example, accelerated 
decline estimated in pneumonia, meningitis, and 
diarrhoea mortality, particularly in the past few years, is 
in part the result of directly taking account of the expected 
effect of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and rotavirus virus 
vaccines in the post-hoc adjustment.
Despite an increasing number of VA study data points 
and two additional countries now included as adequate 
VR countries, the data gap remains large for high burden 
countries and regions where 90% of under-5 deaths still 
occur in countries estimated by VAMCM, yet only 
3% occur in countries with adequate VR in 2015 
(appendix p 3). To improve internal validity of VA, 
innovative approaches such as the minimally invasive 
tissue 
sampling 
(MITS) 
can 
be 
applied.40 
The 
establishment of the Child Health and Mortality 
Prevention Surveillance Network41 applying the MITS 
technique is welcome, although understanding the 
external validity of these approaches and estimates is 
crucial. In high burden countries where systematic 
collection of cause of death information lacks yet 
resources 
and 
technical 
capacity 
could 
become 
sustainably available, sample registration system should 
be attempted. Initiatives, such as the Countrywide

Our uncertainty ranges do not fully capture all the 
associated uncertainties. For example, we have not taken 
into consideration uncertainty associated with model 
inputs or covariates. The estimates for 2015 are 
particularly uncertain, because they were prepared using 
model inputs available up to the end of August, 2015. At 
the time, the most recent empirical estimates of model 
inputs were only available for up to year 2014, and those 
for 2015 were either assumed the same as those in 2014 
or modelled through simplistic approaches. This could 
overestimate the burden of causes for which effective 
interventions are being rapidly scaled up. For example, in 
countries where pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 
rotavirus vaccine are being rapidly scaled up, we might 
have 
overestimated 
the 
burden 
of 
pneumonia, 
meningitis, and diarrhoea in 2015 by assuming that the 
coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 
rotavirus vaccine was the same in 2015 as in 2014. On the 
other hand, applying effectiveness and sometimes 
efficacy parameters from trials could have overestimated 
the life-saving effects of interventions, resulting in 
underestimated pneumonia, meningitis, and diarrhoea 
deaths. To what extent the above two sources of biases 
cancel each other out is unknown. Additional uncertainty 
is likely to be associated with U5MR and number of all-
cause death estimates in the past few years as fewer 
empirical data points are available compared to earlier 
periods.42 Therefore, continued evaluation and reflection 
on MDG 4 beyond 2015 are important.
In the next round, we plan to apply methods to better 
incorporate countries’ transition from VAMCM to 
VRMCM, and those from VRMCM to VR. We will also 
investigate methods to better incorporate national 
empirical data recently collected from low-income and 
middle-income countries into our modelled estimates. 
Additional research is under way to better synthesise 
region-specific efficacy and effectiveness of pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine as inputs to the post-hoc adjustment.
Much has been accomplished on child survival in 
1990–2015, and particularly since 2000. However, 
accelerated investment in child survival is imperative 
post-2015 to achieve the SDG child survival target. 
US$25 billion have been pledged by governments over 
the next 5 years to improve the health of women, 
children, and adolescents.43 With the pledged resources 
and hopefully more to come, concerted efforts are needed 
across disease control and prevention programmes to 
maintain progress for countries which have accomplished 
rapid decline, and to accelerate progress for those that 
have had slower reductions in the past. Progress on child 
survival has benefited from a cohesive action plan in 
achieving the MDG 4 in the past two decades. United and 
continued actions are needed to achieve the SDG child 
survival target by 2030 and end preventable child deaths 
in a generation.44
