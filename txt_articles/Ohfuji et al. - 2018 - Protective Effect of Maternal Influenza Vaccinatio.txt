Background. Infants <6 months of age are too young to receive influenza vaccine, despite being at high risk for severe influen-
za-related complications.
Methods. To examine the effectiveness of maternal influenza vaccination in preventing influenza in their infants, we conducted 
a prospective cohort study of 3441 infants born at participating hospitals before the 2013–2014 influenza season. At the time of re-
cruitment, their mothers completed a questionnaire about influenza vaccination status for the 2013–2014 season. A follow-up survey 
was conducted after the end of the 2013–2014 season to collect information regarding influenza diagnosis and hospitalization among 
infants.
Results. During the 2013–2014 influenza season, 71 infants (2%) had influenza diagnosed, and 13 infants (0.4%) were hospital-
ized with influenza. Maternal influenza vaccination (especially prenatal vaccination) decreased the odds of influenza among infants. 
The effectiveness of prenatal vaccination was 61% (95% confidence interval, 16%–81%), whereas that of postpartum vaccination was 
53% (−28%–83%). Although maternal influenza vaccination was also associated with a decreased odds of influenza-related hospi-
talization among infants, vaccine effectiveness (73%) did not reach statistical significance, owing to the limited number of infants 
hospitalized because of influenza.
Conclusions. The present findings indicated that pregnant women and postpartum women should receive influenza vaccination 
to protect their infants.
Keywords. Influenza; infants; maternal vaccination; prospective cohort study; vaccine effectiveness.
 
Infants <6 months of age are too young to receive the influenza 
vaccine, despite being at high risk for severe influenza-related 
complications. In the United States, to protect these infants, 
influenza vaccination has been recommended for individuals 
who live with or care for these infants, particularly their mothers 
[1]. In addition, the World Health Organization issued a posi-
tion paper recommending that pregnant women be accorded 
the highest priority for seasonal influenza vaccination, owing to 
expectations of vaccine effectiveness in preventing influenza in 
mothers and their infants [2].
However, to our knowledge, only 7 studies have reported the 
effectiveness of maternal influenza vaccination for influenza in 
infants <6 months of age [3–9]. Moreover, these previous stud-
ies have reported inconsistent results. Four studies indicated 
significant vaccine effectiveness in preventing infant influenza 
and its related hospitalization [3–6], while the remaining 3 
studies did not indicate any effectiveness of maternal influ-
enza vaccination [7–9]. We believe there could be several pos-
sible reasons for this inconsistency. Since the previous studies 
focused on the effectiveness of vaccination of pregnant women, 
they might not have taken the possible effects of vaccination of 
postpartum women into consideration. Influenza vaccination 
of postpartum women may prevent influenza among mothers, 
which may contribute to protecting their infants from influ-
enza. If, however, these postpartum-vaccinated women were 
classified as unvaccinated women, it would lead to underesti-
mation of the effectiveness of maternal influenza vaccination. 
In addition, studies that used acute febrile respiratory illness 
rather than laboratory-confirmed influenza as a study outcome 
may have included noninfluenza cases, so that the resultant out-
come misclassification would make it more difficult to detect 
vaccine effectiveness.
Thus, in the present prospective cohort study, which investi-
gated the effectiveness of maternal influenza vaccination in pre-
venting infant influenza and its related hospitalization, maternal

 Effect of Maternal Influenza Vaccination • JID 2018:217 (15 March) • 879
influenza vaccination was divided into prenatal vaccination 
and postpartum vaccination in the detailed analysis, and the 
effectiveness of vaccination during each period was estimated 
separately. In addition, although we used pediatrician-diag-
nosed influenza as the main study outcome, we considered it 
an appropriate substitute for laboratory-confirmed influenza 
because the influenza rapid diagnostic test is routinely per-
formed for infants who visit pediatric hospitals and clinics for 
medical treatment of acute febrile respiratory illnesses during 
the influenza season in Japan.
METHODS
Participants
This study was conducted with the cooperation of the 117 
maternity hospitals and clinics affiliated with the Obstetrical 
Gynecological Society of Osaka, Japan. To enroll infants born 
at the collaborating hospitals and clinics before the start of 
the 2013–2014 influenza season, 10 720 pregnant women (re-
gardless of gestational age) who were attending these hospi-
tals and clinics between September 2013 and December 2013 
were recruited to participate in the present study. At that time, 
2812 women were in the first trimester, whereas 3585 and 4323 
women were in the second and third trimesters, respectively. 
A total of 3841 infants were delivered by these women before the 
start of the 2013–2014 influenza season (ie, between October 
and December 2013) and were identified as study candidates. 
Mothers of the participating infants received an explanation 
of the study from their obstetrician and verbally provided in-
formed consent prior to participation.
The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committees 
at the Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine and 
was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Information Collection
At the time of recruitment, data on the following maternal 
characteristics were obtained by means of a self-administered 
questionnaire completed by each infant’s mother: maternal age, 
height and weight before pregnancy, underlying illnesses, and 
influenza vaccination status for the 2013–2014 season.
With respect to the follow-up survey conducted after the 
2013–2014 influenza season (ie, May 2014), the mothers were 
asked to fill out a mail-back questionnaire to collect the fol-
lowing information that had become available since the time 
of recruitment: for infants, the date and gestational week of 
birth, birth weight, daycare attendance, influenza diagnosis 
made by a pediatrician, and hospitalization; and for moth-
ers, influenza vaccination history after recruitment and influ-
enza diagnosis. Mothers of infants who had been hospitalized 
were also asked to provide the name of the disease that led to 
hospitalization and the name of the hospital. To confirm this 
self-reported information on hospitalization, we contacted 
the pediatricians at the relevant hospitals and asked them to 
provide the following information from the subject’s hospital 
records: date of admission, date of discharge, name of disease 
that led to hospitalization, and laboratory data at the time of 
hospitalization.
In addition, to obtain clinical information about the infants’ 
birth, the obstetrician caring for their mothers was asked to 
complete a structured questionnaire. The questionnaire gath-
ered information about the infants’ date and gestational week 
of birth, birth weight, presence of congenital malformation, and 
birth order (ie, the mother’s parity status when the infant was 
delivered).
Statistical Analysis
As an exposure variable, the effect of maternal influenza vacci-
nation was first investigated after categorizing mothers as un-
vaccinated or receiving vaccination and then after categorizing 
them as unvaccinated, receiving prenatal vaccination, or re-
ceiving postpartum vaccination.
The following 2 outcome measures for infants were used in 
the present study: pediatrician-diagnosed influenza and hospi-
talization due to an influenza diagnosis.
With regard to explanatory variables, maternal age was cat-
egorized as <29, 30–34, and ≥35 years. The following maternal 
influenza-related underlying conditions, based on a previous 
report, were included: chronic respiratory disorders (including 
asthma), cardiovascular disorders (excluding isolated hyper-
tension), kidney disease, liver disease, neurological disorders, 
blood disorders, metabolic disorders (including diabetes), 
immunocompromised state (due to factors such as malignant 
tumors, connective tissue disorders, inflammatory bowel dis-
ease, and chronic rheumatism), and obesity (ie, a body mass 
index [calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the 
height in meters squared] of ≥25.0) [1]. Data regarding the 
number of siblings of the infants were based on the mother’s 
parity status recorded during the obstetrician-administered 
questionnaire.
A logistic regression model was used to calculate the odds 
ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the associa-
tions between maternal influenza vaccination and the outcome 
measures. In the multivariate model, we included all variables 
in the univariate analyses that were related to both maternal 
vaccination status (ie, the exposure variable) and infant influ-
enza diagnosis (ie, the outcome index) with P values of <.10. 
Furthermore, stratified analysis was conducted to examine 
whether the effectiveness of maternal influenza vaccination 
against influenza acquisition by their infants varied according to 
the maternal influenza diagnostic status in the relevant season. 
The χ2 and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were also used where ap-
propriate. All analyses were 2-tailed and were conducted using 
SAS, version 9.3.

RESULTS
Among 3841 infants, incomplete data on the variables under 
study caused the exclusion of 400 infants, leaving 3441 infants 
(89.6%) for analysis. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the 
study infants and their mothers. Median maternal age was 
32 years, and 22% of mothers had influenza-related underlying 
conditions. A total of 39% of mothers received the influenza 
vaccine for the 2013–2014 season, and 27% were vaccinated 
during their pregnancy. A total of 5% of study infants were born 
prematurely, whereas 9% had a low birth weight. Approximately 
half the infants had older siblings, and 8% began attending day-
care facilities in the 2013–2014 season.
Table 2 shows the association between maternal influenza vac-
cination and select background characteristics. Unvaccinated 
mothers were younger than vaccinated mothers. In addition, 
infants’ birth month appeared to affect the timing of maternal 
vaccination (ie, during the prenatal or postpartum periods). 
Preterm birth, low birth weight, and congenital malformations 
were more often observed in infants delivered by unvaccinated 
mothers. Vaccinated mothers were likely to be multipara, sug-
gesting that their infants had at least 1 older sibling.
During the 2013–2014 influenza season, 71 infants (2%) 
had influenza diagnosed (Table 3). Univariate analysis revealed 
that maternal influenza vaccination had a decreasing effect on 
the occurrence of pediatrician-diagnosed influenza among 
infants. The proportion of infants with an influenza diagnosis 
was also lower among those born in December or with a low 
birth weight. On the other hand, maternal influenza diagnosis, 
presence of older siblings, and daycare attendance were associ-
ated with a higher risk of influenza among infants. Even after 
considering the effects of these potential confounding factors, 
maternal vaccination showed a decreasing OR for an influenza 
diagnosis among infants (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, .22–.78). In par-
ticular, prenatal vaccination was associated with a statistically 
significantly lower OR of 0.39 (95% CI, .19–.84). Although 
postpartum vaccination also showed a decreasing OR for influ-
enza among infants, it did not reach statistically significant lev-
els, owing to the limited number of study subjects. Conversely, 
a diagnosis of maternal influenza elevated the OR for a diag-
nosis of influenza in infants by 36-fold, implicating influenza 
in mothers as a strong risk factor for influenza virus infection 
in infants. In addition, the presence of older siblings or daycare 
attendance also increased the ORs for influenza among infants 
by approximately 2–3-fold.
Table 4 shows the association between infant hospitaliza-
tion due to influenza and background characteristics, including 
maternal vaccination. In multivariate analysis, maternal vacci-
nation decreased the OR for infant hospitalization due to in-
fluenza by approximately one fourth, with marginal statistical 
significance (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, .06–1.24). The OR of prenatal 
vaccination was also decreased to 0.33, which, however, was 
not statistically significant. We could not calculate the OR of 
postpartum vaccination, since there were no hospitalized cases 
in this category. On the other hand, maternal influenza was 
associated with a higher risk of infant hospitalization due to 
influenza, while a greater number of older siblings was also as-
sociated with an elevated OR for infant hospitalization. The ORs 
for these variables were 13.8 (95% CI, 4.42–42.9) and 6.88 (95% 
CI, 1.27–37.3), respectively.
The effect of maternal influenza vaccination was examined in 
terms of the status of maternal influenza diagnosis in the 2013–
2014 season (Table 5). Among mothers with a diagnosis of influ-
enza in the 2013–2014 season, the proportion of infants with 
influenza was 33% for unvaccinated mothers, 16% for those with 
a prenatal vaccination, and 16% for those with a postpartum 
vaccination. Among mothers without a diagnosis of influenza, 
the proportions of infants with influenza were much smaller 
(1% for unvaccinated mothers, 0.4% for those with a prenatal 
vaccination, and 0.8% for those with a postpartum vaccination).

 Effect of Maternal Influenza Vaccination • JID 2018:217 (15 March) • 881
However, the ORs of maternal influenza vaccination were quite 
similar regardless of whether the mothers received a diagnosis 
of influenza. Regarding infant hospitalization due to influenza, 
stratified analysis could not provide meaningful results, since 
the number of infants hospitalized due to influenza was very 
limited.
DISCUSSION
The findings of the present study demonstrated that maternal 
influenza vaccination decreases the occurrence of influenza and 
its related hospitalization in their infants. Among infants, the 
vaccine effectiveness of maternal influenza vaccination was 58% 
(95% CI, 22%–78%) for pediatrician-diagnosed influenza and 
73% (95% CI, −24%–94%) for influenza-related hospitalization. 
These results are consistent with those of previous studies con-
ducted in other countries [3–6].
When we examined the effects of maternal vaccination by 
dividing it into prenatal vaccination and postpartum vacci-
nation, prenatal vaccination seemed to be more effective in 
preventing influenza infection in infants; the effectiveness of 
prenatal vaccination for infants’ pediatrician-diagnosed influ-
enza was 61% (95% CI, 16%–81%) and that of postpartum vac-
cination was 53% (95% CI, −28%–83%). However, we did not 
conclude that postpartum vaccination had no effect on infant 
influenza, because the effectiveness of postpartum vaccination 
was 53% (point estimate) and the number of study subjects with 
postpartum vaccination was really smaller than the number of 
those with prenatal vaccination. It is therefore possible that the 
lack of statistical significance in the effectiveness of postpar-
tum vaccination might have resulted from the lack of statistical 
power in our study.
There are 2 possible mechanisms for the observed effect of 
maternal influenza vaccination on decreasing the risk of influ-
enza among infants. The first is through passive immunity, in 
which maternal antibodies produced in response to prena-
tal vaccination are transferred to the fetus via the umbilical 
cord and, thus, protect the infant from contracting influenza. 
Previous studies have reported this possibility by showing the 
presence of passive antibodies in umbilical cords and serum 
samples from infants [10–13]. The second mechanism is that 
vaccinated mothers have a lower risk of developing influenza, 
which secondarily results in a reduced risk of influenza among 
infants. In theory, since prenatal vaccination could have both 
of these effects and postpartum vaccination only includes the 
latter mechanism, the difference between the effectiveness of 
prenatal and postpartum vaccination is probably the effect of 
passive immunity. From this point of view, the effect of passive 
immunity could be calculated as only 8%, and the remaining 
53% might be explained by the latter mechanism. Hence, pre-
natal vaccination is expected to be more effective for prevent-
ing influenza in infants because it exerts effects through both 
mechanisms described above. Prenatal vaccination is therefore 
considered preferable for preventing influenza among infants, 
although if mothers do not receive influenza vaccination during

pregnancy, postpartum vaccination would also be useful in pro-
tecting their infants from the threat of influenza.
The present study also showed strong associations between 
an influenza diagnosis among infants and the presence of influ-
enza in their mothers, the presence of older siblings, and attend-
ance at a daycare facility. In particular, the risk of an influenza 
diagnosis among infants with mothers who had influenza was 
36 times the risk among infants without mothers who had 
influenza. In general, younger infants, especially those aged 
<6 months, tend to be kept inside the house during winter; 
therefore, household members are usually the primary source 
of influenza virus infection among infants. Mothers in partic-
ular tend to have the most contact with infants because they 
are usually their main caregivers. Hence, if a mother is infected 
with influenza virus, it is often easily transmitted to their infant. 
Infants can also be exposed to influenza virus in the daycare 
setting. Therefore, to protect infants <6 months of age who 
are too young to be vaccinated, family members living in the 
same household (particularly mothers) should receive influenza 
vaccine; the stratified analysis in the present study supported 
this recommendation by also showing the protective effect of 
maternal influenza vaccination against influenza among infants

whose mothers received a diagnosis of influenza. And if family 
members contract influenza, protective measures, such as wear-
ing masks and putting some distance between infected family 
members and the infant, should be taken to avoid transmission 
to the infant.
In the present study, infants born in December and those with 
low a birth weight had a lower risk of influenza. These findings 
are unexpected but might be explained by the possibility that a 
decreased opportunity for contact with influenza virus results 
in a lower odds of contracting influenza. Specifically, during the 
influenza season, infants born in December are younger than 
those born in October and, thus, have a greater likelihood of 
remaining indoors in the winter. In addition, because infants 
with a low birth weight are usually treated in incubators until 
they reach an adequate weight, they may have spent less time at 
home during the influenza season than those with a normal or 
higher birth weight. However, we cannot confirm whether this 
explanation is accurate, since we did not obtain any informa-
tion on the frequency of leaving home and the date of hospital 
discharge after birth. In addition, infants born in December had 
an increased odds of hospitalization, although the association 
was not statistically significant. Thus, it seems sensible to have

reservations about a relationship between birth month and 
influenza risk among infants.
The present study has the following advantages. First, this is 
the first study to investigate the effects of maternal vaccination 
on influenza among infants by using a large cohort of infants 
(>3000). This enabled us to examine not only the effects of ma-
ternal vaccination, but also that of prenatal versus postpartum 
vaccination, which further helps to elucidate the mechanisms 
of protective effects of maternal influenza vaccination against 
influenza among infants. Second, while information on infant 
hospitalization relied on self-reported data from mothers, the 
accuracy of the data was ensured by contacting the relevant 
admitting hospital. Although we were able to obtain informa-
tion from hospital records for only 54% of infants reported to 
be hospitalized, almost all information obtained from moth-
ers about the admission date and name of the disease leading 
to hospitalization was identical to the data from the hospital 
records. Thus, we believe that the self-reported information 
about infant hospitalization was reliable. Third, since all study 
subjects were recruited from within Osaka Prefecture, charac-
teristics of the subjects’ exposure to influenza viruses were con-
sidered to be similar.
However, this study also had some limitations. First, there 
may have been some misclassification of infants’ influenza 
diagnoses. However, in Japan, since rapid diagnostic tests are 
conventionally used in the clinical setting, almost all reports of 
infant influenza would be expected to be based on the results 
of rapid tests. On the other hand, the infants’ influenza diagno-
ses would be affected by their mothers’ attitudes toward seek-
ing medical attention. For example, febrile infants observed at 
home without visiting a medical facility may have been classified 
as not having influenza even if they had contracted the virus. 
However, since infants were as young as several months olds, 
most mothers would have taken their infants to the hospital or 
clinic if they had a fever. Thus, the number of misclassifications 
of infants’ influenza diagnoses, if any, would be expected to be 
low, compared with the studies targeting older infants. Second, 
generally speaking, since vaccinated mothers have a higher 
level of health consciousness than unvaccinated mothers, they 
might avoid taking their infants outside in the influenza season. 
If this behavior was different between vaccinated and unvacci-
nated mothers, the observed vaccine effectiveness in the present 
study might be biased toward overestimation. Third, since the 
infants in the present study were all born at obstetric facilities in 
Osaka Prefecture before the beginning of the 2013–2014 influ-
enza season, there is some concern about the generalizability 
of the results. Further investigation in different seasons and 
regions is desirable to confirm the validity of the findings in the 
present study.
In conclusion, these results indicate that maternal vaccina-
tion could protect infants from contracting influenza. Pregnant 
women should receive influenza vaccination to protect not only 
themselves but also their infants. If they do not receive influ-
enza vaccination during pregnancy, postpartum vaccination 
would also be useful in protecting their infants from the threat 
of influenza.
