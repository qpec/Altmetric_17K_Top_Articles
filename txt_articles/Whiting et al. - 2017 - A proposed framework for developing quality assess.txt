Abstract
Background: Assessment of the quality of included studies is an essential component of any systematic review.
A formal quality assessment is facilitated by using a structured tool. There are currently no guidelines available for
researchers wanting to develop a new quality assessment tool.
Methods: This paper provides a framework for developing quality assessment tools based on our experiences of
developing a variety of quality assessment tools for studies of differing designs over the last 14 years. We have also
drawn on experience from the work of the EQUATOR Network in producing guidance for developing reporting
guidelines.
Results: We do not recommend a single ‘best’ approach. Instead, we provide a general framework with
suggestions as to how the different stages can be approached. Our proposed framework is based around three key
stages: initial steps, tool development and dissemination.
Conclusions: We recommend that anyone who would like to develop a new quality assessment tool follow the
stages outlined in this paper. We hope that our proposed framework will increase the number of tools developed
using robust methods.

Background
Systematic reviews are generally considered to provide
the most reliable form of evidence for decision makers
[1]. A formal assessment of the quality of the included
studies is an essential component of any systematic
review [2, 3]. Quality can be considered to have three
components—internal validity (risk of bias), external val-
idity (applicability/variability) and reporting quality. The
quality of included studies depends on them being suffi-
ciently well designed and conducted to be able to pro-
vide reliable results [4]. Poor design, conduct or analysis
can introduce bias or systematic error affecting study
results and conclusions—this is also known as internal
validity. External validity or the applicability of the study
to the review question is also an important component
of study quality. Reporting quality relates to how well
the study is reported—it is difficult to assess other
components of study quality if the study is not reported
with the appropriate level of detail.
When
conducting
a
systematic
review,
stronger
conclusions can be derived from studies at low risk of
bias, rather than when evidence is based on studies with
serious methodological flaws. Formal quality assessment
as part of a systematic review, therefore, provides an in-
dication of the strength of the evidence on which con-
clusions are based and allows comparisons between
studies based on risk of bias [3]. The GRADE system for
rating the overall quality of the evidence included in a
systematic review is recommended by many guidelines
and systematic review organisations such as National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and
Cochrane. Risk of bias is a key component of this along
with publication bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indir-
ectness and magnitude of effect [5, 6].
A formal quality assessment is facilitated by using a
structured tool. Although it is possible for reviewers to
simply assess what they consider to be key components
of quality, this may result in important sources of bias

 being omitted, inappropriate items included or too much
emphasis being given to particular items guided by
reviewers’ subjective opinions. In contrast, a structured
tool provides a convenient standardised way to assess
quality providing consistency across reviews. Robust
tools are usually developed based on empirical evidence
refined by expert consensus.
This paper provides a framework for developing
quality assessment tools. We use the term ‘quality as-
sessment tool’ to refer to any tool designed to target
one or more aspects of the quality of a research
study. This term can apply to any tool whether
focused specifically on one aspect of study quality
(usually risk of bias) or for broader tools covering
additional aspects such as applicability/generalisability
and reporting quality. We do not place any restric-
tions on the type of ‘tool’ to which this framework
can be approach—it should be appropriate for a var-
iety
of
different
approaches
such
as
checklists,
domain-based approaches, tables or graphics or any
other format that developers may want to consider.
We
do
not
recommend
a
single
‘best’ approach.
Instead, we provide a general framework with sugges-
tions on how the different stages can be approached.
This is based on our experience of developing quality
assessment tools for studies of differing designs over
the last 14 years. These include QUADAS [7] and
QUADAS-2
[8]
for
diagnostic
accuracy
studies,
ROBIS [9] for systematic reviews, PROBAST [10] for
prediction modelling studies, ROBINS-I [11] for non-
randomised
studies
of
interventions
and
the
new
version of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for rando-
mised trials (RoB 2.0) [12]. We have also drawn on
experience from the work of the EQUATOR Network
in producing guidance for developing reporting guide-
lines [13].
Methods
Over the years that we have been involved in the de-
velopment of quality assessment tools and through in-
volvement
in
different
development
processes,
we
noticed that the methods used to develop each tool
could be mapped to a similar underlying process. The
proposed
framework
evolved
through
discussion
among the team, describing the steps involved in de-
veloping the different tools, and then grouping these
into appropriate headings and stages.
Results: Proposed framework
The Fig. 1 and Table 1 outline the proposed steps in our
framework, grouped into three stages. The table also in-
cludes examples of how each step was approached for
the tools that we have been involved in developing. Each
step is discussed in detail below.
Stage 1: initial steps
Identify the need for a new tool
The first step in developing a new quality assessment
(QA) tool is to identify the need for a new tool: What is
the rationale for developing the new tool? In their
guidance on developing reporting guidelines, Moher et
al. [13] stated that “developing a reporting guidelines is
complex and time consuming, so a compelling rationale
is needed”. The same applies to the development of QA
tools. It may be that there is no existing QA tool for the
specific study design of interest; a QA tool is available
but not directly targeted to the specific context required
(e.g. tools designed for clinical interventions may not be
appropriate for public health interventions), existing
tools might not be up to date, new evidence on particu-
lar sources of bias may have emerged that is not ad-
equately addressed by existing tools, or new approaches
to quality assessment mean that a new approach is
needed. For example, QUADAS-2 and RoB 2.0 were de-
veloped as experience, anecdotal reports, and feedback
suggested areas for improvement of the original QUA-
DAS and Cochrane risk of bias tools [7]. ROBIS was de-
veloped as we felt there was no tool that specifically
addressed risk of bias in systematic reviews [9].
It is important to consider whether a completely new
tool is needed or whether it may be possible to modify
or adapt an existing tool. If modifying an existing tool,
then the original can act as a starting point, although in
practice, the new tool may look very different from the
original. Both QUADAS-2 [8] and the new Cochrane
risk of bias tool used the original versions of these tools
as a starting point [12].
Obtain funding for the tool development
There are costs involved in developing a new QA tool.
These will vary depending on the approach taken but
items that may need to be funded include researcher
time, literature searching, travel and subsistence for at-
tending meetings, face-to-face meetings, piloting the
tool, online survey software, open access publication
costs, website fees and conference attendance for dis-
semination. We have used different approaches to fund
the development of quality assessment tools. QUADAS-
2 [8] was funded by the UK Medical Research Council
Methodology Programme as part of a larger project
grant. ROBIS, [9] ROBINS-I [11] and Cochrane ROB 2.0
[12] were funded through smaller project-specific grants,
and
PROBAST
[10]
received
no
specific
funding.
Instead, the host institutions for each steering group
member allowed them time to work on the project and
covered travel and subsistence for regular steering group
meetings and conference attendance. Freely available
survey monkey software (www.surveymonkey.co.uk) was
used to run an online Delphi process.

 Assemble team
Assembling a team with the appropriate expertise is a
key step in developing a quality assessment tool. As
tool development usually relies on expert consensus,
it is essential that the team includes people with an
appropriate range of expertise. This generally includes
methodologists with expertise in the study designs
targeted by the tool, people with expertise in QA tool
development and also end users, i.e. reviewers who
will be using the tool. Reviewers are a group that
may sometimes be overlooked but are essential to en-
sure that the final tool is usable by those for whom it
is developed. If the tool is likely to be used in differ-
ent content areas, then it is important to include re-
viewers who will be using the tool in all contexts. For
example, ROBIS is targeted at different types of sys-
tematic reviews including reviews of interventions,
diagnostic accuracy, aetiology and prognosis. We in-
cluded team members who were familiar with all dif-
ferent
types
of
review
to
ensure
that
the
team
included the appropriate expertise to develop the tool.
It can also be helpful to include reviewers with a
range of expertise from those new to quality assess-
ment to more experienced reviewers. Including repre-
sentatives from a wide range of organisations can also
be helpful for the future uptake and dissemination of
the tool. Thinking about this at an early stage is help-
ful. The more organisations that are involved in the
development of the tool, the more likely these organi-
sations are to feel some ownership of the tool and to
want to implement the tool within their organisation
in the future. The total number of people involved in
tool development varies. For our tools, the number of
people involved directly in the development of each
tool ranged from 27 to 51 with a median of 40.
Manage the project
The size and the structure of the project team also need
to be carefully considered. In order to cover an appro-
priate range of expertise, it is generally necessary to
include a relatively large group of people. It may not be
practical for such a large group to be involved in the
day-to-day development of the tool, and so it may be de-
sirable to have a smaller group responsible for driving
the project by leading and coordinating all activities, and
involving the larger group where their input is required.
For example, when developing QUADAS-2 and PRO-
BAST, a steering group of around 6–8 people led the
development of the tool, bringing in a larger consensus
group to help inform decisions on the scope and content
of the tool. For ROBINS-I and Cochrane ROB 2.0, a
smaller
steering
group
led
the
development
with
domain-based working groups developing specific areas
of the tool.
Define the scope
The scope of the quality assessment tool needs to be
defined at an early stage. The Table 2 outlines key
questions to consider when defining the scope. Tools
generally target one specific type of study. The specific
study design to be considered is one of the first compo-
nents to define. For example, QUADAS-2 [8] focused on
diagnostic accuracy studies, PROBAST [10] on predic-
tion modelling studies and the Cochrane Risk of Bias
tool on randomised trials. Some tools may be broader,
targeted
at
multiple
related
designs.

 ROBINS-I targets all non-randomised studies of inter-
ventions rather than one single study design such as
cohort studies. When deciding on the focus of the tool,
it is important to clearly define the design and topic
areas targeted. Trade-offs of different approaches need
consideration. A more focused tool can be tailored to a
specific topic area. A broader tool may not be as specific
but can be used to assess a wider variety of studies. For
example, we developed ROBIS to be used to assess any
type of systematic review, e.g. intervention, prognostic,
diagnostic or aetiology. Previous tools, such as the
AMSTAR tool, were developed to assess reviews of
RCTs [14]. Key to any quality assessment tool is a defin-
ition of quality as addressed by the tool, i.e. defining
what exactly the tool is trying to address. We have found
that once the definition of quality has been clearly
agreed, then it becomes much easier to decide on which
items to include in the tool.
Other features to consider include whether to address
both internal (risk of bias) and external validity (applic-
ability) and the structure of the tool. The original QUA-
DAS tool used a simple checklist design and combined
items on risk of bias, reporting quality and applicability.
Our more recently developed tools have followed a
domain-based approach with a clear focus on assessment
of risk of bias. Many of these domain-based tools also in-
clude sections covering applicability/relevance. How to
rate individual items included in the tool also forms part
of the scope. The original QUADAS tool [7] used a simple
‘yes, no or unclear’ rating for each question. The domain-
based tools such as QUADAS-2, [8] ROBIS [9] and
PROBAST [10] have signalling questions which flag the
potential for bias. These are generally factual questions
and can be answered as ‘yes, no or no information’. Some
tools include a ‘probably yes’ or ‘probably no’ response to
help reviewers answer these questions when there is not
sufficient information for a more definite response. The
overall domain ratings then use decision ratings like ‘high,
low or unclear’ risk of bias. Some tools, such as ROBINS-I
[11] and the RoB 2.0 [12], include additional domain level
ratings such as ‘critical, severe, moderate or low’ and ‘low,
some concerns, high’. We strongly recommend that at this
stage, tool developers are explicit that quality scores
should not be incorporated into the tools. Numerical sum-
mary quality scores have been shown to be poor indicators
of study quality, and so, alternatives to their use should be
encouraged [15, 16]. When developing many of our tools,
we were explicit at the scope stage that we wanted to
come up an overall assessment of study quality but avoid
the use of quality scores. One of the reasons for introdu-
cing the domain level structure first used with the
QUADAS-2 tool was explicit to avoid users calculating
quality scores by simply summing the number of items
fulfilled.
Agreeing the scope of the tool may not be straightfor-
ward and can require much discussion between team
members. An additional consideration is how decisions
on scope will be made. Will this be by a single person,
by the steering group and should some or all decisions
be agreed by the larger group? The approach that we
have often taken is for a smaller group (e.g. steering
group) to propose the scope of the tool with the agree-
ment reached following consultation with the larger
group. Questions on the scope can often form the first
discussion points at a face-to-face meeting (e.g. ROBIS
[9] and QUADAS-2 [8]) or the first questions on a web-
based survey (e.g. PROBAST [10]).
As with any research project, a protocol that clearly
defines the scope and proposed plans for the develop-
ment of the tool should be produced at an early stage of
the tool development process.
Stage 2: tool development
Generate initial list of items for inclusion
The starting point for a tool is an initial list of items to
consider for inclusion. There are various ways in which
this list can be generated. These include looking at exist-
ing tools, evidence reviews and expert knowledge. The
most comprehensive way is to review the literature for
potential sources of bias and to provide a systematic re-
view summarising the evidence for the effects of these.
This is the approach we took for the original QUADAS
tool [7] and also the updated QUADAS-2 [8, 17, 18].
Reviewing the items included in existing tools and
summarising the number of tools that included each
potential item can be a useful initial step as it shows
which potential items of bias have been considered as
important by previous tool developers. This process was
followed for the original QUADAS tool [7] and for
ROBIS [9]. Examining how previous systematic reviews
have incorporated quality into their results can also be
helpful to provide an indication of the requirements of a
QA tool. If you are updating a previous QA tool then
this will often form the starting point for potential items
to include in the updated tool. This was the case for
QUADAS-2 [8] and the RoB 2.0 [12]. For ROBINS-I
Table 2 Question to consider when defining the scope
● What study designs will be targeted by the new tool?
● Will the tool consider only risk of bias (internal validity) or will it also
be concerned with assessing applicability (external validity) and
possibly reporting quality?
● What is the definition of quality for the tool? How is risk of bias
defined? How are other components of quality defined (if included),
e.g. applicability?
● What type of tool structure will be adopted, e.g. simple checklist
design or a domain-based approach?
● How will quality items be rated within the tool?
Whiting et al. Systematic Reviews  (2017) 6:204

 [11], domains were agreed at a consensus meeting, and
then expert working groups identified potential items
to include in each domain. Generating the list of
items for inclusion was, therefore, based on expert
consensus rather than reviewing existing evidence.
This can also be a valid approach. The development
of PROBAST used a combined approach of using an
existing tool for a related area as the starting point
(QUADAS-2), non-systematic literature reviews and
expert input from both steering group members and
wider PROBAST group [10].
Agree initial items and scope
After the initial stages of tool development which can
often be performed by a smaller group, input from the
larger group should be sought. Methods for gaining in-
put from the larger group include holding a face-to-face
meeting or a web-based survey. At this stage, the scope
defined in step 1.5 can be brought to the larger group
for further discussion and refinement. The initial list of
items needs to be further refined until agreement is
reached on which items should be included in an initial
draft of the tool. If a face-to-face meeting is held, smaller
break-out groups focussing on specific domains can be a
helpful structure to the meeting. QUADAS-2, ROBIS
and ROBINS-I all involved face-to-face meetings with
smaller break-out groups early in the development
process [8, 9, 11]. If moving straight to a web-based sur-
vey, then respondents can be asked about the scope with
initial questions considering possible items to include.
This approach was taken for PROBAST [10] and the ori-
ginal QUADAS tool [7]. For PROBAST, we also asked
group members to provide supporting evidence for why
items should be included in the tool [10]. Items should
be turned into potential questions/signalling questions
for inclusion in the tool at this relatively early stage in
the development of the tool.
Produce first draft of tool and develop guidance
Following the face-to-face meeting or initial survey
rounds, a first draft of the tool can be produced. The ini-
tial draft may be produced by a smaller group (e.g. steer-
ing group), single person, or by taking a domain-based
approach with the larger group split into groups with
each
taking
responsibility
for
single
domains.
For
QUADAS-2 [8] and PROBAST [10], a single person de-
veloped the first draft which was then agreed by the
steering group before moving forwards. The first draft of
ROBIS was developed following the face-to-face meeting
by two team members. Initial drafts of ROBINS-I [11]
and the RoB 2.0 [12] were produced by teams working
on single domains proposing initial versions for their do-
mains. Drafts for each domain were then put together
by the steering group to give a first draft of the tool.
Once a first draft of the tool is available, it may be help-
ful to start producing a clear guidance document de-
scribing how to assess each of the items included in the
tool. The earlier such a guide can be produced, the more
opportunity there will be to pilot and refine it alongside
the tool.
Pilot and refine
The first draft of the tool needs to go through a process
of refinement until a final version that has agreement of
the wider group is achieved. Consensus may be achieved
in various ways. Online surveys consisting of multiple
rounds until agreement on the final tool is reached are a
good way of involving large numbers of experts in this
process. This is the approach used for QUADAS, [7],
QUADAS-2 [8], ROBIS, [9] and PROBAST [10]. If
domain-based working groups were adopted for the
initial development of the tool, these can also be used to
finalise the tool. Members of the full group can then
provide feedback on draft versions, including domains
that they were not initially assigned to. This approach
was used for ROBINS-I and RoB 2.0. It would also be
feasible to combine such an approach with a web-
based survey.
Whilst the tool is being refined, initial piloting work
can be undertaken. If a guidance document has been
produced, then it can be included in the piloting process.
If the tool is available in different formats, for example
paper-based or Access database, then these could also be
made available and tested as part of the piloting. The re-
search team may ask reviewers working on appropriate
review topics to pilot the tool in their review. Alterna-
tively, reviewers can be asked to pilot the tool on a series
of sample papers and to provide feedback on their ex-
perience of using the tool. An efficient way of complet-
ing such a process is to hold a piloting event where
reviewers try out the tool on a sample of papers which
they can either bring with them or that are provided to
them. This can be a good approach to get feedback in a
timely and interactive manner. However, there are costs
associated with running such an event. Asking reviewers
to pilot the tool in ongoing reviews can result in delays
as piloting cannot be started until the review is at the
data extraction stage. Identifying reviews at an appropri-
ate stage with reviewers willing to spend the extra time
needed to pilot a new tool is not always straightforward.
We held a piloting event when developing the RoB 2.0
and found this to be very efficient in providing immedi-
ate feedback on the tool. We were also able to hold a
group discussion for reviewers to provide suggestions
for improvements to the tool and to highlight any items
that they found difficult. For previous tools, we used re-
mote piloting which provided helpful feedback but was
not as efficient as the piloting event. Ideally, any piloting
Whiting et al. Systematic Reviews  (2017) 6:204 
Page 6 of 9
 process should involve reviewers with a broad range of
experience ranging from those with extensive experience
of conducting quality assessment of studies of a variety
of designs to those relatively new to the process.
The time taken for piloting and refining the tool
can vary considerably. For some tools, such as ROBIS
and
QUADAS-2,
this
process
was
completed
in
around 6–9 months. For PROBAST and ROBINS-I,
the process took over 4 years.
Stage 3: dissemination
Develop a publication strategy
A strategy to disseminate the tool is required. This
should be discussed at the start of the project but may
evolve as the tool is developed. The primary means of
dissemination is usually through publication in a peer-
reviewed journal. A more detailed guidance document
can accompany the publication and be made available as
a web appendix. Another option is to have dual publica-
tions, one reporting the tool and outlining how it was
developed, and a second providing additional guidance
on how to use the tool. This is sometimes known as an
‘E&E’ (explanation and elaboration) publication and is
an approach adopted by many reporting guidelines [13].
Establish a website
Developing a website for the tool can help with dissem-
ination. Ideally, the website should be developed before
publication of the tool so that details can be included in
the publication. The final version of the tool can be
posted on the website together with the full guidance
document. Details on who contributed to the tool devel-
opment and any funding should also be acknowledged on
the website. Additional resources to help reviewers use
the tool can also be posted there. For example, the ROBIS
(www.robis-tool.info) and QUADAS (www.quadas.org)
websites both contain Microsoft Access database that re-
viewers can use to complete their assessment and tem-
plates to produce graphical and tabular displays. They also
contain links to other relevant resources and details of
training opportunities. Other resources that may be useful
to include on tool websites include worked examples and
translations of the tools, where available. QUADAS-2 has
been translated into Italian and Japanese, and the transla-
tions of these tools can be accessed via its website. If the
tool has been endorsed or recommended for use by par-
ticular organisations (e.g. Cochrane, UK National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)), then this could
also be included on the website.
The website is also a helpful way to encourage
comments about the tool, which can lead to its further
improvement, and exchange of experiences with the tool
implementation.
Encourage uptake of tool by leading organisations
Encouraging organisations, both national and inter-
national, to recommend the tool for use in their sys-
tematic reviews is a very effective means of making
sure that, once developed, the tool is used. There are
different ways this can be achieved. Involving repre-
sentatives from a wide range of organisations as part
of the development team may mean that they are
more likely to recommend the use of the tool in their
organisations. Presentations at conferences, for ex-
ample the Cochrane Colloquium or Health Technol-
ogy Assessment Conference, may increase knowledge
of the tool within that organisation making it more
likely that the tool may be recommended for use.
Running workshops on the tool for organisations can
help increase familiarity and usability of the tool.
These can also provide helpful feedback for what to
include in guidance documents and to inform future
updates of the tool. For example, we have been run-
ning
workshops
on
QUADAS
and
ROBIS
within
Cochrane for a number of years. We have also pro-
vided training to institutions such as NICE on how to
use the tools. QUADAS is now recommended by both
these organisations, among many others, for use in
diagnostic accuracy reviews. We have also run work-
shops on ROBIS, PROBAST, ROBINS-I and RoB 2.0
at the annual Cochrane Colloquium. We were re-
cently approached by the Estonian Health Insurance
Fund with a request to provide training to some of
their reviewers so that they could implement ROBIS
within
their
guideline
development
process.
We
supported this by running a specific training session
for them.
Ultimately, the best way to encourage tool uptake is to
make sure that the tool was developed robustly and fills
a gap where there is currently no existing tool or there
are limitations with existing tools. Ensuring that the tool
is widely disseminated also means that the tool is more
likely to be used and recommended.
Translate tools
After the tool has been published, you may receive
requests to translate the tool. Translation can help to
disseminate the tool and encourage its use in a much
broader range of countries. Tool translations, there-
fore, should be encouraged but it is important to re-
assure
yourself
that
the
translation
has
been
completed appropriately. One method to do this is
via back translation.
Discussion
In this paper, we suggest a framework for developing
quality assessment tools. The framework consists of
Whiting et al. Systematic Reviews  (2017) 6:204 
Page 7 of 9
 three stages: (1) initial steps, (2) tool development and
(3) dissemination. Each stage includes defined steps that
we consider important to follow when developing a tool;
there is some flexibility on how these stages may be
approached. In developing this framework, we have
drawn on our extensive experience of developing quality
assessment tools. Despite having used different ap-
proaches to the development of each of these tools, we
found that all approaches shared common features and
processes. This led to the development of the frame-
work. We recommend that anyone who would like to
develop a new quality assessment tool follow the stages
outlined in this paper.
When developing a new tool, you need to decide how to
approach each of the proposed stages. We have given
some examples of how to do this, other approaches may
also be valid. Factors that may influence how you choose
to approach the development of your tool include avail-
able funding, topic area, number and range of people to
involve, target audience and tool complexity. For example,
holding face-to-face meetings and running piloting events
incur greater costs than web-based surveys or asking re-
viewers to pilot the tool at their own convenience. More
complex tools may take longer, require additional expert-
ise, and require more piloting and refinement.
We are not aware of any existing guidance on how to
develop QA tools. Moher and colleagues have produced
guidance on how to develop reporting guidelines [13].
These have been cited over 190 times, mainly by new
reporting guidelines, suggesting that many reporting
guideline developers have found a structured approach
helpful. In the absence of guidance specifically for the
development of QA tools, we also based our develop-
ment of QUADAS-2 [8] and ROBIS [9] on the guidance
for developing reporting guidance. Although many of
the steps proposed by Moher et al. apply to the develop-
ment of QA tool, there are areas where these are not
directly relevant and where specific guidance on devel-
oping QA tools would be helpful.
There are a very large number of quality assessment
tools available. When developing ROBIS and QUADAS,
we conducted reviews of existing quality assessment tools.
These identified 40 tools to assess the quality of systematic
reviews [19] and 91 tools to assess the quality of diagnos-
tic accuracy studies [20]. However, only three systematic
review tools (7.5%) [19] and two diagnostic tools (2%)
reported being rigorously developed [20]. The lack of a
rigorous development process for most tools suggests a
need for guidance on how to develop quality assessment
tools. We hope that our proposed framework will increase
the number of tools developed using robust methods.
The large number of quality assessment tools avail-
able makes it difficult for people working on system-
atic reviews to choose the most appropriate tool(s)
for use in their reviews. Therefore, we are developing
an initiative similar to the EQUATOR Network to im-
prove the process of quality assessment in systematic
reviews. This will be known as the LATITUDES
Network
(www.latitudes-network.org).
LATITUDES
aims to highlight and increase the use of key risk of
bias assessment tools, help people to use these tools
more effectively, improve incorporation of results of
the risk of bias assessment into the review and to dis-
seminate best practice in risk of bias assessment.
Conclusions
We recommend that anyone who would like to de-
velop a new quality assessment tool follow the stages
outlined in this paper. We hope that our proposed
framework will increase the number of tools devel-
oped using robust methods.

Funding
The development of QUADAS-2, ROBIS and the new version of the
Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2.0) were funded
by grants from the UK Medical Research Council (G0801405/1, MR/
K01465X/1, MR/L004933/1- N61 and MR/K025643/1). ROBINS-I was funded
by the Cochrane Methods Innovation Fund.
