BACKGROUND: Most US adults consume excess sodium. Knowledge 
about the dietary sources of sodium intake is critical to the development of 
effective reduction strategies.
METHODS: A total of 450 adults were recruited from 3 geographic 
locations: Birmingham, AL (n=150); Palo Alto, CA (n=150); and the 
Minneapolis–St. Paul, MN (n=150), metropolitan areas. Equal numbers 
of women and men from each of 4 race/ethnic groups (blacks, Asians, 
Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites) were targeted for recruitment. 
Four record-assisted 24-hour dietary recalls were collected from each 
participant with special procedures, which included the collection of 
duplicate samples of salt added to food at the table and in home food 
preparation.
RESULTS: Sodium added to food outside the home was the leading 
source of sodium, accounting for more than two thirds (70.9%) of total 
sodium intake in the sample. Although the proportion of sodium from this 
source was smaller in some subgroups, it was the leading contributor 
for all subgroups. Contribution ranged from 66.3% for those with a high 
school level of education or less to 75.0% for those 18 to 29 years of age. 
Sodium inherent to food was the next highest contributor (14.2%), followed 
by salt added in home food preparation (5.6%) and salt added to food at 
the table (4.9%). Home tap water consumed as a beverage and dietary 
supplement and nonprescription antacids contributed minimally to sodium 
intake (<0.5% each).
CONCLUSIONS: Sodium added to food outside the home accounted 
for ≈70% of dietary sodium intake. This finding is consistent with the 
2010 Institute of Medicine recommendation for reduction of sodium in 
commercially processed foods as the primary strategy to reduce sodium 
intake in the United States.

S
odium reduction has been a component of the 
Dietary Guidelines for Americans since 1980.1 
However, despite long-standing recommendations 
to limit sodium, most American adults and children con-
sume too much. The prevalence of excess US dietary 
sodium intake in 2009 to 2012 ranged, by age group, 
from 85.0% to 93.7%.2 On the basis of the presumption 
that most sodium consumed came from sodium added 
to commercially packaged and prepared foods, in 2010, 
the Institute of Medicine recommended gradual stepwise 
reductions of the sodium content of these foods as the 
primary strategy to reduce intake.3
Although numerous studies have examined the contri-
butions to sodium intake of specific foods, food catego-
ries, and supplements/antacids,4–7 the amount of discre-
tionary salt added by the consumer (eg, at the table) is 
difficult to estimate. Thus, most studies are unable to 
estimate sodium intake from all sources and the rela-
tive contribution of each source. In 1991, Mattes and 
Donnelly8 reported that sodium added to food in com-
mercial processing was the primary source of sodium 
in the diet (77.0% of total intake), followed by sodium 
inherent in food (11.6%), sodium from salt added to food 
at the table (6.2%), sodium from salt added to food in 
home cooking (5.1%), and water ingested as a beverage 
(0.1%).
Given the changes in national food production and 
consumption patterns in the 25 years since the Mattes 
and Donnelly8 article was published, an update is war-
ranted. Furthermore, the sample size in that study 
was small (n=62 adults), and participants were ho-
mogeneous (predominately female and white from 1 
US geographic region). Thus, we conducted a study 
to provide contemporary data on the major sources 
contributing to total sodium intake in a larger, more 
diverse sample of adults, with a primary focus on the 
proportion of total intake from sodium added to food 
outside the home (eg, added during commercial pro-
cessing and preparation).
METHODS
Population and Recruitment
Between December 2013 and December 2014, a convenience 
sample of 450 adults was recruited from 3 geographic loca-
tions: Birmingham, AL (n=150); Palo Alto, CA (n=150); and 
the Minneapolis–St. Paul, MN (n=150), metropolitan areas. 
We recruited into the study equal numbers of women and men 
from each of 4 race/ethnic groups (blacks, Asians, Hispanics, 
and non-Hispanic whites).
Recruitment and data collection activities were conducted 
by the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Stanford University, 
and the University of Minnesota–Twin Cities. Recruitment strat-
egies included invitations extended to university employees at 
each of the universities; study fliers posted around campus 
and at various community health fairs; university and commu-
nity newspaper advertisements; and e-mail messages sent to 
study participants in past studies who had consented to being 
notified of future studies.
During a screening telephone interview, potential partici-
pants were determined eligible if they were between 18 (Palo 
Alto and Minneapolis–St. Paul) or 19 (Birmingham) and 75 years 
old, were generally healthy, and had a telephone. Exclusion 
criteria included being pregnant or breastfeeding or having 
chronic kidney disease or diabetes insipidus. Participants at 
all sites were offered a $10 token of appreciation for each 
completed 24-hour diet recall interview (total of 4 interviews or 
$40). All participants provided written informed consent. The 
institutional review board at each participating institution and 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reviewed and 
approved the study procedures.
Overview of Data Collection and Measurements
The dietary assessment procedures were designed to allow 
quantification of the amount and proportion of sodium from 
the following sources: (1) salt added to food at the table; (2) 
salt added to food in home food preparation; (3) sodium from 
home tap water consumed as a beverage; (4) sodium that is 
inherent to food; (5) sodium that is added to food in processing 
outside the home; and (6) sodium from dietary supplements 
and nonprescription antacids.
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This study identifies the major sources of sodium in 
the diets of adults from 3 geographic regions in the 
United States.
• The study shows that sodium added to food outside 
the home accounts for more than two thirds of total 
sodium intake, whereas sodium added to food at 
the table and in home food preparation is a minor 
contributor to total sodium intake.
• Study findings align with a 2010 Institute of Medi-
cine recommendation for reduction of sodium in 
commercially processed foods as the primary strat-
egy to reduce sodium intake in the United States.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Commercially processed and restaurant foods 
should be the primary focus when educating patients 
on strategies for lowering sodium in the diet.
• For packaged food products, the Nutrition Facts 
panel may be useful in identifying lower-sodium 
products.
• When individuals eat outside the home, sodium con-
tent information for menu items should be requested 
and used as a guide in making food choices.
• Limiting salt added to food at the table and in home 
food preparation should also be encouraged, but 
patients should be advised that changes in these 
behaviors alone may not be sufficient for achieving 
the recommended intake level.

Participants attended 1 clinic visit and completed 4 record-
assisted telephone 24-hour dietary recall interviews over an 
11-day period. Duplicate samples of salt added to food at the 
table and in home food preparation were collected by the par-
ticipant on each of the 4 days for which dietary recalls were 
collected.
Before the clinic visit, participants were asked if their home 
drinking water was from a private well. In addition, they were 
asked if their tap water was softened or if it was filtered by a 
home filtration system. If they responded affirmatively to 1 or 
2 of these questions, they were instructed to bring a sample of 
their home tap water to their clinic visit using a study provided 
collection kit.
At the clinic visit, tap water samples were collected from 
participants as appropriate, and a questionnaire was admin-
istered to obtain information about demographics, smoking, 
and general health. Height was measured with a wall-mounted 
stadiometer, and weight was measured with a digital scale. 
Four telephone 24-hour dietary recall interviews were sched-
uled with the participants within the next 11 days. Three of the 
recalls were scheduled to capture eating for a weekday, and 
1 recall was scheduled to capture eating on a weekend day. 
Participants were given a food record form to complete the day 
before each scheduled recall. Participants were instructed to 
record on the form the foods eaten and, for foods to which salt 
was added in home preparation, the total yield (total amount 
prepared). Participants were given salt collection kits to use 
in collecting duplicate samples of salt added to their food at 
the table and in home food preparation. They were instructed 
to collect the duplicate samples the day before each sched-
uled telephone recall, thus aligning collection with the 24-hour 
dietary recall period.
Collection of Duplicate Samples of Salt
For collection of salt added to food at the table, participants 
were instructed to shake the same amount of salt added to 
food at the table throughout the day into a plastic resealable 
collection bag provided by the study for this purpose. The 
same instructions were provided to collect duplicate amounts 
of salt added to food in home food preparation, with a separate 
bag used for each food item prepared with salt. In addition, 
participants were asked to record the name of the food item 
and to share the instructions and collection bags with anyone 
else in their household who may have prepared food at home 
the day of collection.
Preaddressed postage-paid envelopes were provided for 
mailing the duplicate salt samples to the study center. At each 
study center, the contents of each bag were weighed on a 
digital scale, and the weight was entered into a spreadsheet.
Dietary Recall Collection
All 24-hour dietary recalls were administered by staff at the 
University of Minnesota Nutrition Coordinating Center who 
were trained and certified in the administration of dietary 
recalls following study procedures. Nutrition Data System for 
Research software (developed by the Nutrition Coordinating 
Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis) was used for 
the administration and analysis of the recalls.9 Use of dietary 
supplements and nonprescription antacids over the 24-hour 
recall period was assessed with the Nutrition Data System for 
Research Dietary Supplement Assessment Module.10
A variety of study-specific procedures were used during 
recall collection and processing to ensure that the sources of 
sodium of interest in this study could be ascertained. For exam-
ple, participants were asked whether certain types of foods 
(baked goods, mixed dishes, salads, cooked vegetables, etc) 
had been prepared at home. If the food had been prepared at 
home, they were asked whether salt had been added in prepa-
ration. If it had, they were asked additional questions such as 
the yield of the recipe (how much was made).
Procedures for Calculating Sodium Intake by 
Source
Postrecall data processing procedures included calculating 
sodium from home tap water consumed as a beverage using 
participant-specific sodium content values for water. If the 
participant’s home tap water was from a public water supply 
and he or she did not have a water softener or water filtration 
system in the home, the sodium content of water in his or 
her community as published in municipal water quality reports 
was used. For the remaining participants, the water sample 
turned in at the clinic visit was chemically analyzed (Traut Water 
Analysis Laboratory, Wiate Park, MN) to determine its sodium 
content.
Sodium from salt added to food at the table and in home 
food preparation was calculated from data from the duplicate 
salt samples. The duplicate sample data were added to the 
dietary recall records following a detailed set of data calcula-
tion and entry rules.
To estimate the amount of sodium in foods that was inher-
ent and added outside the home, we adhered to the definitions 
developed by Mattes and Donnelly.8 These researchers defined 
inherent as sodium that is naturally present in food, and they 
defined sodium added to food outside the home as sodium 
contributed by the addition of sodium compounds in process-
ing food outside the home. Examples of these compounds 
include sodium chloride, sodium benzoate, sodium phosphate, 
and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). For every food, the 
proportion of sodium in the food considered to be added to 
food outside the home was estimated with a set of rules and 
procedures (online-only Data Supplement).
The validity of sodium intake estimates from the 24-hour 
dietary recalls was evaluated in a subset of study participants 
(n=150). Four 24-hour urine collections were obtained from 
the subset over the same time period that the 24-hour dietary 
recalls were collected. A full description of methods and find-
ings of the validation component of the study is being reported 
in another article. To summarize key findings, mean 24-hour 
urinary sodium level in the subset was 3198 compared with 
3325 mg/d from the 24-hour dietary recalls (P=0.30).
Data Analysis
For analyses carried out to describe sodium intake by source, 
means and mean proportions11 were calculated. For each study 
participant, mean daily sodium intake overall and from each 
source was calculated by averaging the sodium intake esti-
mates from the four 24-hour dietary recalls collected from the 
participant. One participant had only 3 recalls, and the average

was calculated from 3 instead of 4 recalls for this person. The 
mean estimates were used in analyses to characterize sodium 
intake. Because food intake is known to vary from weekday to 
weekend days, data were weighted so that results reflect the 
appropriate balance of weekday and weekend days in a week.
To characterize sources of sodium among population sub-
groups, analyses were carried out stratified by sex, age, level 
of education, race, and geographic region. Multivariate regres-
sion analyses were conducted to determine whether differ-
ences between groups were statistically significant (P<0.05). 
If the overall F test for a demographic variable was significant, 
pairwise comparisons were conducted. Analyses were carried 
out with SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
In accord with recruitment targets, 450 participants 
were recruited; one-half of participants were female, and 
one-third were from each of the 3 study sites (Table 1). 
The numbers of participants were approximately equal 
by age group, and about one-third of participants were 
non-Hispanic white with approximately equal numbers of 
Asian, black, and Hispanic participants. Demographics 
by race are provided in Table 1. Recruitment targets for 
each ethnic group varied by site; consequently, distribu-
tion of race by site is unequal.
Mean total daily sodium intake in the sample was 
3501 mg/d. Total sodium intake was similar across the 
age groups examined in multivariate-adjusted analyses 
(Table 2). There were differences in total sodium intake 
by sex (24% higher in men), race (higher in blacks and 
Asians compared with Hispanics), education level (17% 
higher in those with high school or lower level of educa-
tion compared with college graduates), site (higher in 
Alabama compared with California and Minnesota), and 
body weight (17% higher in those who were obese com-
pared with normal-weight participants).
The proportion of total sodium intake by source is 
presented in the Figure. For the total sample, sodium 
added to food outside the home (in commercial food 
processing, restaurant food preparation, etc) was the

leading source of sodium, accounting for 70.9% of to-
tal sodium intake. Sodium inherent to food was the next 
highest contributor (14.2%), followed by salt added in 
home food preparation (5.6%) and salt added to food at 
the table (4.9%). Home tap water consumed as a bever-
age and dietary supplements and nonprescription antac-
ids each contributed <0.5% to total sodium intake.
Numerous differences in sources between demo-
graphic groups were found in multivariate-adjusted anal-
yses (Table3). However, for all groups, sodium added 
to food outside the home was the leading contributor 
to sodium intake (66.3%–75.0%); and sodium inherent 
to food, salt added in home food preparation, and salt 
added to food at the table were the next largest contribu-
tors. In all groups, sodium from home tap water and so-
dium from dietary supplements were minor contributors 
(<0.5% for most groups).
Sodium added to food outside the home was a higher 
proportion of total sodium intake among those 18 to 24 
years of age (75.0%) compared with those in the older 
age groups (67.4%–70.5%). Conversely, salt added to 
food in home food preparation and salt added at the 
table were larger contributors to total sodium intake 
among older compared with younger participants.
Numerous differences in sodium sources by race 
were found. Asians and non-Hispanic whites obtained 
less sodium from salt added to food at the table (3.3% 
and 4.0%, respectively), whereas blacks obtained a 
greater share of sodium from this source (8.0%) com-
pared with these groups. Non-Hispanic whites obtained 
less sodium from salt added to food in home preparation 
(3.5%) compared with Hispanics (8.6%).
Multiple differences in sources of sodium by educa-
tion level were evident. Those with the lowest level of 
education obtained a higher proportion of sodium from 
salt added to food at the table compared with those with 
a higher level of education. In contrast, sodium inher-
ent in food and sodium from home tap water made up 
smaller proportions of total sodium in those with a high 
school degrees or less education compared with those 
with a higher level of education.
A number of differences in sources of sodium by 
site were evident. Most notable is that participants in 
Alabama obtained a greater proportion of sodium from 
salt added to food at the table (9.5%) compared with 
participants in California (3.4%) and Minnesota (2.3%). 
Analyses were carried out to evaluate whether sources 
of sodium differed on weekdays and weekend days, and 
proportions were found to be similar for weekdays and 
weekend days.
DISCUSSION
Sodium added to food outside the home was the lead-
ing source of sodium in this diverse sample, accounting 
for more than two-thirds (70.9%) of total sodium intake. 
Although this source of sodium was a smaller proportion 
of sodium intake in some subgroups, it was the lead-
ing contributor for all groups (range, 66.3%–75.0%). 
These findings are consistent with those of the Mattes 
and Donnelly8 study. In that study, which consisted of a 
sample of predominately female and white adults from 
1 US geographic region (n=62), 77% of total sodium 
intake was attributable to sodium added to food outside 
the home. Like Mattes and Donnelly,8 we found sodium 
inherent to food, sodium from salt added to food at the 
table, sodium from salt added in home food preparation, 
and sodium from water consumed as a beverage to be 
notably smaller contributors than sodium added to food 
outside the home.
We found statistically significant differences in sourc-
es of sodium intake among demographic subgroups. 
In some cases, the differences observed were mod-
est and may be of limited public health significance. In 
other cases, the differences were sizable and poten-
tially worthy of consideration in the design of sodium 
reduction interventions. Most notable is that although 
sodium added to food outside the home accounted 
for the majority of intake, sodium from salt added to 
food at the table accounted for 9.5% of total sodium 
intake for those from the Alabama site (455 mg/d). If 
sodium from salt added to food at the table were re-
duced by 400 mg/d among study participants residing 
in Alabama, notable reductions in blood pressure and 
the incidence of coronary heart disease, myocardial 
infraction, and stroke might be expected according 
to projections of dietary sodium reductions reported 
by Bibbins-Domingo et al.12 Whether salt added at the 
table is a significant source of sodium intake among 
adults in Alabama, or potentially in other geographic 
areas, warrants further investigation.

findings of demographic differences in sodium intake 
were inconsistent with other findings. We found sodium 
intake to be higher among those with less education, 
which is inconsistent with other studies in which no dif-
ference14 or lower intake15 in those with less education 
was found. Sodium intake was notably higher among 
those from the Alabama site (3899 mg/d), whereas 
previous research has found sodium intake to be lower 
among those in southeastern compared with nonsouth-
eastern states.17,18 Blacks had a higher sodium intake 
in our sample, whereas other studies have found so-
dium intake of blacks to be lower than that of other 
groups.2,15,17,18
Study strengths include a larger sample size (n=450) 
than the previous study that identified sources of sodium 
in the diet of a sample of adults in the United States.8 In 
addition, the sample in our study had better representa-
tion with respect to race and geographic areas.
Study limitations include the use of a convenience 
rather than a probability-based sample, potentially 
limiting the generalizability of the results. The preva-
lences of hypertension (24%) and overweight/obe-
sity (66%) in the study sample were similar to those 
in the US adult population (29.1% and 68.5% for hy-
pertension and overweight/obesity, respectively19,20). 
However, the educational attainment distribution of 
the sample differed from the general population (the 
study sample included more college graduates). The 
process of completing multiple 24-hour dietary recalls 
and collecting duplicate samples of salt used at the 
table and in home food preparation could have led to 
changes in eating behavior and salt use (Hawthorne 
effect), although we have no way of assessing whether 
this may have occurred.
Our data suggest that sodium added to food outside 
the home accounts for the majority of sodium con-
sumed by US adults. These findings support the primary 
Institute of Medicine–recommended strategy to reduce 
sodium intake in the United States through setting tar-
gets to reduce the sodium content of commercially pro-
cessed and prepared foods.3 According to a recent re-
port, 36 countries have set voluntary sodium targets for 
specific foods.21 In the United Kingdom, this approach 
resulted in an ≈15% (560 mg/d sodium, or 1.4 g/d salt) 
reduction in the average population sodium intake from 
2003 to 2011 and was associated with significant de-
creases in blood pressure and cardiovascular disease 
deaths over the same time periods.22 Public education 
efforts should continue, with foods consumed outside 
the home (eg, restaurant and commercially processed 
foods) the primary focus of this education. Limiting salt 
added to food at the table and in home food preparation 
should also be recommended but framed as a second-
ary strategy that may be helpful when paired with ef-
forts to limit sodium from restaurant and commercially 
processed foods.
