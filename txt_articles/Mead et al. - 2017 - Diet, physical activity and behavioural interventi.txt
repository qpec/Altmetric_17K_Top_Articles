Background
Child and adolescent overweight and obesity has increased globally, and can be associated with significant short- and long-term health
consequences. This is an update of a Cochrane review published first in 2003, and updated previously in 2009. However, the update
has now been split into six reviews addressing different childhood obesity treatments at different ages.
Objectives
To assess the effects of diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions (behaviour-changing interventions) for the treatment of
overweight or obese children aged 6 to 11 years.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS as well as trial registers ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP
Search Portal. We checked references of studies and systematic reviews. We did not apply any language restrictions. The date of the last
search was July 2016 for all databases.
Selection criteria
We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions (behaviour-changing interven-
tions) for treating overweight or obese children aged 6 to 11 years, with a minimum of six months’ follow-up. We excluded interventions
that specifically dealt with the treatment of eating disorders or type 2 diabetes, or included participants with a secondary or syndromic
cause of obesity.

 Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened references, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and evaluated the quality of the evidence
using the GRADE instrument. We contacted study authors for additional information. We carried out meta-analyses according to the
statistical guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.
Main results
We included 70 RCTs with a total of 8461 participants randomised to either the intervention or control groups. The number of
participants per trial ranged from 16 to 686. Fifty-five trials compared a behaviour-changing intervention with no treatment/usual care
control and 15 evaluated the effectiveness of adding an additional component to a behaviour-changing intervention. Sixty-four trials
were parallel RCTs, and four were cluster RCTs. Sixty-four trials were multicomponent, two were diet only and four were physical
activity only interventions. Ten trials had more than two arms. The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low and 62 trials
had a high risk of bias for at least one criterion. Total duration of trials ranged from six months to three years. The median age of
participants was 10 years old and the median BMI z score was 2.2.
Primary analyses demonstrated that behaviour-changing interventions compared to no treatment/usual care control at longest follow-
up reduced BMI, BMI z score and weight. Mean difference (MD) in BMI was -0.53 kg/m2 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.82 to -
0.24); P < 0.00001; 24 trials; 2785 participants; low-quality evidence. MD in BMI z score was -0.06 units (95% CI -0.10 to -0.02); P
= 0.001; 37 trials; 4019 participants; low-quality evidence and MD in weight was -1.45 kg (95% CI -1.88 to -1.02); P < 0.00001; 17
trials; 1774 participants; low-quality evidence.
Thirty-one trials reported on serious adverse events, with 29 trials reporting zero occurrences RR 0.57 (95% CI 0.17 to 1.93); P = 0.37;
4/2105 participants in the behaviour-changing intervention groups compared with 7/1991 participants in the comparator groups).
Few trials reported health-related quality of life or behaviour change outcomes, and none of the analyses demonstrated a substantial
difference in these outcomes between intervention and control. In two trials reporting on minutes per day of TV viewing, a small
reduction of 6.6 minutes per day (95% CI -12.88 to -0.31), P = 0.04; 2 trials; 55 participants) was found in favour of the intervention.
No trials reported on all-cause mortality, morbidity or socioeconomic effects, and few trials reported on participant views; none of
which could be meta-analysed.
As the meta-analyses revealed substantial heterogeneity, we conducted subgroup analyses to examine the impact of type of comparator,
type of intervention, risk of attrition bias, setting, duration of post-intervention follow-up period, parental involvement and baseline
BMI z score. No subgroup effects were shown for any of the subgroups on any of the outcomes. Some data indicated that a reduction in
BMI immediately post-intervention was no longer evident at follow-up at less than six months, which has to be investigated in further
trials.
Authors’ conclusions
Multi-component behaviour-changing interventions that incorporate diet, physical activity and behaviour change may be beneficial in
achieving small, short-term reductions in BMI, BMI z score and weight in children aged 6 to 11 years. The evidence suggests a very
low occurrence of adverse events. The quality of the evidence was low or very low. The heterogeneity observed across all outcomes
was not explained by subgrouping. Further research is required of behaviour-changing interventions in lower income countries and
in children from different ethnic groups; also on the impact of behaviour-changing interventions on health-related quality of life and
comorbidities. The sustainability of reduction in BMI/BMI z score and weight is a key consideration and there is a need for longer-
term follow-up and further research on the most appropriate forms of post-intervention maintenance in order to ensure intervention
benefits are sustained over the longer term.

 Across the world more children are becoming overweight and obese. These children are more likely to suffer from health problems,
both while as children and in later life. More information is needed about what works best for treating this problem.
Study characteristics
We found 70 randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups)
comparing diet, physical activity, and behavioural (where habits are changed or improved) treatments to a variety of control groups
delivered to 8461 overweight or obese children aged 6 to 11 years. We reported on the effects of 64 multicomponent interventions
(different combinations of diet and physical activity and behaviour change), four physical activity interventions and two dietary
interventions compared with no intervention, ’usual care’ or some other therapy if it was also delivered in the intervention arm. The
children in the included studies were followed up between six months and three years.
Key results
The average age of the children was 10 years. Most studies reported the body mass index (BMI) z score: BMI is a measure of body fat
and is calculated by dividing weight (in kilograms) by the square of the body height measured in metres (kg/m²). In children, BMI is
often measured in a way that takes into account sex and age, weight, and height changes as children grow older (BMI z score).
We summarised the results of 37 trials in 4019 children reporting the BMI z score, which on average was 0.06 units lower in the
intervention groups compared with the control groups. We summarised the results of 24 trials in 2785 children reporting BMI, which
on average was 0.53 kg/m2 lower in the intervention groups compared with the control groups. We summarised the results of 17 trials
in 1774 children reporting weight, which on average was 1.45 kg lower in the intervention groups compared with the control groups.
Other effects of the interventions, such as improvements in health-related quality of life were less clear. No study investigated death
from any cause, morbidity or socioeconomic effects. Serious adverse events were rare: only two of 31 trials with data reported any
serious adverse events (4/2105 participants in the behaviour-changing intervention groups compared with 7/1991 participants in the
comparator groups). This evidence is up to date as of July 2016.
Quality of the evidence
The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low, mainly because of limited confidence in how studies were performed, and the
results were inconsistent between the studies. Also there were just a few studies for some outcomes, with small numbers of included
children.

 B A C K G R O U N D
The prevalence of overweight and obese children and adolescents
has increased throughout the world, presenting a global public
health crisis (Ng 2014; WHO 2015). Although once considered to
be a condition affecting only high-income countries, rates of pae-
diatric overweight and obesity have recently started to rise dramat-
ically in some low- and middle-income countries (Wang 2012).
Using the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) standard def-
inition, the age-standardised prevalence of overweight and obe-
sity in children and adolescents has increased in low-, middle-,
and high-income countries over the last 30 years (Cole 2000). In
2013, the prevalence of overweight and obese children and ado-
lescents in high-income countries was estimated at 23.8% (95%
confidence interval (CI) 22.9 to 24.7) for boys and 22.6% (95%
CI 21.7 to 23.6) for girls. In low- and middle-income countries,
the prevalence was estimated as 12.9% (95% CI 12.3 to 13.5) for
boys and 13.4% (95% CI 13 to 13.9) for girls (Ng 2014).
Inequalities in overweight and obesity prevalence have also
been documented. Generally, socioeconomically disadvantaged
children in high-income countries (Knai 2012; NCB 2015;
Shrewsbury 2008), and children of higher socioeconomic status in
low- and middle-income countries (Lobstein 2004; Wang 2012),
are at greater risk of becoming overweight. However, this relation-
ship may vary by population demographics (for example age, gen-
der, ethnicity), and environment (for example country, urbanisa-
tion) (Wang 2012). The prevalence of obesity has been shown to
vary by ethnicity, with large data sets showing substantial ethnic
variation in English (HSCIC 2013), American (Freedman 2006;
Skinner 2014), and New Zealand (Rajput 2014) child popula-
tions.
Whilst there is some evidence that the rate of increase in paediatric
obesity may be slowing in some high-income countries, current
levels remain too high, and continue to rise in many low- and
middle-income countries (Olds 2011; Rokholm 2010). However,
an additional concern in some high-income countries such as the
USA, in Kelly 2013 and Skinner 2014, and the UK, in CMO
2015 and Ells 2015a, is the rise in severe paediatric obesity. Whilst
the IOTF published an international definition for severe paedi-
atric (morbid) obesity in 2012 (Cole 2012), often severe obesity
prevalence is reported using country-specific cut points, making
international comparisons difficult. However, data from the USA,
in Skinner 2014, and England, in Ells 2015a, have shown that
the prevalence of severe paediatric obesity varies by socioeconomic
status and ethnicity, and may result in a greater risk of adverse car-
diometabolic events and severe obesity in adulthood (Kelly 2013).
Description of the condition
Childhoodoverweightandobesityresultsfromanaccumulationof
excess body fat, and can increase the risk of both short- and longer-
term health consequences. Numerous obesity-related comorbidi-
ties can develop during childhood, which include muscular skele-
tal complaints (Paulis 2014); cardiovascular risk factors such as hy-
pertension, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidaemia (Reilly 2003),
even in very young children (Bocca 2013); motor and develop-
mental delays (Cataldo 2016); and conditions such as sleep ap-
noea (Narang 2012), asthma (Egan 2013), liver disease, and type 2
diabetes (Daniels 2009b; Lobstein 2004). The condition can also
affect psychosocial well-being, with obese young people being sus-
ceptible to reduced self esteem and quality of life (Griffiths 2010),
as well as stigmatisation (Puhl 2007; Tang-Peronard 2008). Evi-
dence also shows that childhood obesity can track into adulthood
(Parsons 1999; Singh 2008; Whitaker 1997), and is therefore asso-
ciated with an increased risk of ill health later in life (Reilly 2011).
Description of the intervention
Given the serious implications associated with childhood and ado-
lescent obesity, effective treatment is imperative. Whilst the fun-
damental principles of weight management in children and ado-
lescents are the same as in adults (that is, reduced energy intake
and increased energy expenditure), the primary aim of treatment
(that is, weight reduction or deceleration of weight gain) and the
most suitable intervention approach vary, and are dependent on
the child’s age and degree of excess weight, among other consid-
erations. Family-based interventions combining dietary, physical
activity, and behavioural components have been shown to be ef-
fective and are considered the current best practice in the treat-
ment of childhood obesity in children under 12 years of age (Oude
Luttikhuis 2009).
Adverse effects of the intervention
It is not anticipated that diet, physical activity, and behavioural
interventions will lead to adverse outcomes. However, as with all
obesity treatment interventions in children and young people, po-
tential adverse effects should be considered, including effects on
linear growth, eating disorders and psychological well-being.
How the intervention might work
Obesity is a complex multifactorial condition with numerous
possible biological, behavioural and environmental determinants
(Butland 2007). Many children now grow up in an obesogenic
environment that promotes energy imbalance through the mar-
keting, affordability and availability of energy dense foods, cou-
pled with decreases in physical activity and increases in screen-
based sedentary pursuits (Kremers 2006). Therefore, behaviour-
changing interventions that aim to improve dietary intake, in-
crease physical activity levels and reduce sedentary behaviours are
often prescribed, and were recommended as a treatment option
7

 for childhood obesity in the preceding Cochrane Review on the
treatment of child and adolescent obesity (Oude Luttikhuis 2009).
Behaviour-changing interventions may target just one behavioural
component (e.g. diet, physical activity or sedentary behaviour)
or combine several components, and are often supported by the-
ory-based behaviour-change techniques to help sustain positive
changes and prevent relapse. As the family environment (e.g. home
activities, meal times and availability of unhealthy food) plays an
important role in the aetiology of obesity, parents can be defined
as the ’agents for change’ particularly in children under 12 years of
age (Golan 2004). Given the number of interacting components,
difficulty of the target behaviours and variability in possible out-
comes, behaviour-changing interventions are regarded as ‘complex
interventions’ (Craig 2008).
Why it is important to do this review
The first version of this systematic review was published in 2003
and included analysis of childhood obesity treatment trials pub-
lished up until July 2001 (Summerbell 2003). The second ver-
sion was published in 2009, updating the 2003 review (Oude
Luttikhuis 2009).
To reflect the rapid growth in this field, the third update to this
review has been split across six reviews focusing on the following
treatment approaches: surgery (Ells 2015b); drugs (Mead 2016a);
parent-only interventions (Loveman 2015); diet, physical activity,
and behavioural interventions for young children up to the age of
six years (Colquitt 2016); schoolchildren aged 6 to 11 years; and
adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.
The currentreviewexaminesthe effectsof interventionsforschool-
aged children aged from 6 years to 11 years. The results of this cur-
rent review and other systematic reviews in this series will provide
information on which to underpin clinical guidelines and health
policy on the treatment of childhood obesity.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cluster RCTs.
Included studies observed participants for a minimum of six
months (this time frame refers to the intervention itself or to a
combination of the intervention with a follow-up phase).
Types of participants
Overweight or obese participants, with a mean age of six years and
over, andunder12yearsatthe commencementof the intervention.
Trials involving participants with comorbid disorders were eligible
for inclusion as long as the primary focus of the intervention was
to treat overweight and obese children. Parents could be involved
in the intervention; however, interventions focused solely on the
parents (with no child involvement) were excluded from this re-
view as they are evaluated in another Cochrane Review: ’Parent-
only interventions for childhood overweight or obesity’ (Loveman
2015).
Types of interventions
Any behaviour-changing intervention (with any one or any com-
bination of behavioural, nutritional and physical activity compo-
nent) delivered as a single or multicomponent intervention, in any
setting, using any delivery method, which aimed to treat paedi-
atric obesity using any of the following intervention versus control
sequences.
Intervention
• Behaviour-changing intervention (any forms of dietary,
physical activity and/or behavioural therapy delivered as single-
or multicomponent interventions)
Comparator
• No treatment (including wait-list control)
• Usual care
• Concomitant intervention (another behaviour-changing
intervention, which was also delivered in the intervention group).
Minimum duration of intervention
No restriction on the length of intervention
Minimum duration of follow-up
Minimal duration of follow-up was six months from baseline.
Specific exclusion criteria
• Studies with pregnant participants
• Studies that included critically ill participants
• Interventions that specifically dealt with the treatment of
eating disorders or type 2 diabetes
• Studies that included participants with a secondary or
syndromic cause of obesity
Types of outcome measures
We did not exclude trials if one or several of the review primary
or secondary outcomes were not reported.

• Anthropometric measures other than change in BMI:
defined by the use of validated tools (such as waist circumference,
skin fold thickness, waist-to-hip ratio, dual X-ray absorptiometry

and any time point from six months’ follow-up.
• Behaviour change: defined as validated measures of diet or
physical activity and measured at baseline and any time point
from six months’ follow-up.

documented or accounts from participant feedback and
measured at baseline and any time point from six months’
follow-up.
• Socioeconomic effects: defined as a validated measure of
socioeconomic status such as parental income or educational
status and measured at baseline and at least at six months.

Searching other resources
We tried to identify other potentially eligible trials or ancillary
publications by searching the reference lists of retrieved included
trials, (systematic) reviews, meta-analyses and health technology
assessment reports. We also contacted study authors of included
trials to identify any further studies that we may have missed.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors (two of CO, EC, EM, KR, LA, LA-K, LE)
independently scanned the abstract, title, or both, of every record
we retrieved in the literature searches, to determine which trials we
should assess further. We obtained the full texts of all potentially-
relevant records. We resolved any discrepancies through consensus
or by recourse to a third review author (EM, LE, TB). We have
presented a PRISMA flow-chart showing the process of trial selec-
tion (Liberati 2009).

 Data extraction and management
For trials that fulfilled our inclusion criteria, two review authors
(two of CO, DJ, EB, EC, EM, GM, JO, KR, LA, LA-K, LB, LE,
TB) independently abstracted key participant and intervention
characteristics. We reported data on efficacy outcomes and ad-
verse events using standard data extraction sheets from Cochrane
Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders. We resolved any disagree-
ments by discussion or, if required, by consultation with a third
review author (EM, KR, LE, TB) for details, see Characteristics of
included studies; Appendix 2; Appendix 3; Appendix 4; Appendix
5; Appendix 6; Appendix 7; Appendix 8; Appendix 9; Appendix
10; Appendix 11).
We have provided information including trial identifier about po-
tentially relevant ongoing studies in the Characteristics of ongoing
studies table. We attempted to locate the protocol of each included
study and reported primary, secondary and other outcomes in
comparison with data in publications in Appendix 6.
We attempted to email all authors of included trials to enquire
whether they were willing to answer questions regarding their tri-
als; Appendix 11 shows the results of this survey. Thereafter, we
sought relevant missing information on the trial from the primary
author(s) of the article, if required.
Dealing with duplicate and companion publications
In the event of duplicate publications, companion documents or
multiple reports of a primary trial, we tried to maximise yield
of information by collating all available data, and used the most
complete dataset aggregated across all known publications.
We listed duplicate publications, companion documents, multiple
reports of a primary trial and trial documents of included trials
(such as trial registry information) as secondary references under
the study ID of the included trial. Furthermore, we also listed
duplicate publications, companion documents, multiple reports
of atrial andtrial documentsof excludedtrials(such as trial registry
information) as secondary references under the study ID of the
excluded trial.
Data from clinical trial registers
In case data from included trials were available as study results in
clinical trials registers such as ClinicalTrials.gov or similar sources,
we made full use of this information and extracted data. If there
was also a full publication of the trial, we collated and critically
appraised all available data. If an included trial was marked as
a completed study in a clinical trials register but no additional
information (study results, publication or both) was available, we
added this trial to the table Characteristics of studies awaiting
classification.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (two of EM, TB, LE, KR, DJ, JO, GM, EC,
CO, EB, LA, LA-K, LB) independently assessed the risk of bias of
each included trial. We resolved any disagreements by consensus
or by consultation with a third review author (EM, TB, LE, KR).
In case of disagreement, we consulted the rest of the group and
made a judgement based on consensus. If adequate information
was not available from trial authors, trial protocols, or both we
contacted trial authors for missing data on ’Risk of bias’ items.
We used the Cochrane ’Risk of bias’ assessment tool (Higgins
2011a) and judged ’Risk of bias’ criteria as having low, high, or
unclear risk. We evaluated individual bias items as described in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions accord-
ing to the criteria and associated categorisations contained therein
(Higgins 2011b).
Random sequence generation (selection bias due to
inadequate generation of a randomised sequence) -
assessment at trial level
For each included trial we described the method used to generate
the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment
of whether it should produce comparable groups.
• Low risk of bias: the trial authors achieved sequence
generation using computer-generated random numbers or a
random numbers table. Drawing of lots, tossing a coin, shuffling
cards or envelopes, and throwing dice are adequate if an
independent person performed this who was not otherwise
involved in the trial. We considered the use of the minimisation
technique as equivalent to being random.
• Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information about the
sequence generation process.
• High risk of bias: the sequence generation method was non-
random or quasi-random (e.g. sequence generated by odd or
even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on
date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule
based on hospital or clinic record number; allocation by
judgement of the clinician; allocation by preference of the
participant; allocation based on the results of a laboratory test or
a series of tests; or allocation by availability of the intervention).
Allocation concealment (selection bias due to inadequate
concealment of allocation prior to assignment) - assessment
at trial level
We described for each included trial the method used to conceal al-
location to interventions prior to assignment and assessed whether
intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of or
during recruitment, or changed after assignment.
• Low risk of bias: central allocation (including telephone,
interactive voice-recorder, web-based and pharmacy-controlled
randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of
identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed
envelopes.
• Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information about the
allocation concealment.
• High risk of bias: using an open random allocation schedule
(e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used

 without appropriate safeguards; alternation or rotation; date of
birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed
procedure.
Blinding of participants and study personnel (performance
bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by
participants and personnel during the trial) - assessment at
outcome level
We evaluated the risk of detection bias separately for self-reported
(’subjective outcomes’) versus investigator-assessed (’objective out-
comes’) outcomes (Hróbjartsson 2013). We noted whether end-
points were self-reported, investigator-assessed or adjudicated out-
come measures (see below).
• Low risk of bias: blinding of participants and key study
personnel is ensured, and it was unlikely that the blinding could
have been broken; no blinding or incomplete blinding, but we
judge that the outcome is unlikely to have been influenced by
lack of blinding.
• Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information about the
blinding of participants and study personnel; the trial does not
address this outcome.
• High risk of bias: no blinding or incomplete blinding, and
the outcome is likely to have been influenced by lack of blinding;
blinding of trial participants and key personnel attempted, but
likely that the blinding could have been broken, and the
outcome was likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.
Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias due to
knowledge of the allocated interventions by outcome
assessment) - assessment at outcome level
We evaluated the risk of detection bias separately for self-reported
(’subjective outcomes’) versus investigator-assessed (’objective out-
comes’) outcomes (Hróbjartsson 2013). We noted whether end-
points were self reported, investigator-assessed or adjudicated out-
come measures (see below).
• Low risk of bias: blinding of outcome assessment is ensured,
and it was unlikely that the blinding could have been broken; no
blinding of outcome assessment, but we judge that the outcome
measurement was unlikely to have been influenced by lack of
blinding.
• Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information about the
blinding of outcome assessors; the trial did not address this
outcome.
• High risk of bias: no blinding of outcome assessment, and
the outcome measurement was likely to have been influenced by
lack of blinding; blinding of outcome assessment, but likely that
the blinding could have been broken, and the outcome
measurement was likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias due to amount,
nature or handling of incomplete outcome data) - assessment
at outcome level
Foreach includedtrial andforself-reported(’subjective outcomes’)
versus investigator-assessed (’objective outcomes’) outcomes, we
described the completeness of data, including attrition and exclu-
sions from the analyses. We stated whether the trial reported at-
trition and exclusions, and the number of participants included
in the analysis at each stage (compared with the number of ran-
domised participants per intervention/comparator groups). We
also noted if the trial reported the reasons for attrition or exclusion
and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were
related to outcomes. We considered the implications of missing
outcome data per outcome such as high dropout rates (e.g. above
15%) or disparate attrition rates (e.g. difference of 10% or more
between trial arms).
• Low risk of bias: no missing outcome data; reasons for
missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome (for
survival data, censoring unlikely to introduce bias); missing
outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups,
with similar reasons for missing data across groups; for
dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes
compared with observed event risk was not enough to have a
clinically-relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate; for
continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (mean difference
or standardised mean difference) among missing outcomes is not
enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect
size; appropriate methods, such as multiple imputation, were
used to handle missing data.
• Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information to assess
whether missing data in combination with the method used to
handle missing data were likely to induce bias; the trial did not
address this outcome.
• High risk of bias: reason for missing outcome data was
likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in
numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups;
for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing
outcomes compared with observed event risk enough to induce
clinically-relevant bias in intervention effect estimate; for
continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (mean difference
or standardised mean difference) among missing outcomes
enough to induce clinically-relevant bias in observed effect size;
’as-treated’ or similar analysis done with substantial departure of
the intervention received from that assigned at randomisation;
potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation.
Selective reporting (reporting bias due to selective outcome
reporting) - assessment at trial level
We assessed outcome reporting bias by integrating the results of
Appendix 5, ’Matrix of trial endpoints (publications and trial doc-
uments)’ (Boutron 2014; Jones 2015b; Mathieu 2009), with those
11
Diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obese children from the age of 6 to 11 years
(Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 of Appendix 6, ’High risk of outcome reporting bias according to
ORBIT classification’ (Kirkham 2010). This analysis formed the
basis for the judgement of selective reporting.
• Low risk of bias: the trial protocol was available and all of
the trial’s pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that
were of interest in the review had been reported in the pre-
specified way; the study protocol was unavailable, but it was clear
that the published reports included all expected outcomes
(ORBIT classification).
• Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information about selective
reporting.
• High risk of bias: not all of the trial’s pre-specified primary
outcomes review were reported incompletely so that we could
not enter them in a meta-analysis; the trial report failed to
include results for a key outcome that we would expected to have
been reported for such a trial (ORBIT classification).
Other bias (bias due to problems not covered elsewhere) -
assessment at trial level
• Low risk of bias: the trial appears to be free of other sources
of bias.
• Unclear risk of bias: there was insufficient information to
assess whether an important risk of bias existed; insufficient
rationale or evidence that an identified problem introduced bias.
• High risk of bias: the trial has a potential source of bias
related to the specific trial design used; the trial has been claimed
to have been fraudulent; or the trial had some other serious
problem.
We have presented a ’Risk of bias’ graph and a ’Risk of bias’ sum-
mary figure.
We distinguished between self-reported, investigator-assessed and
adjudicated outcome measures.
We defined the following endpoints as potentially self-reported
outcomes.
• Adverse events, if reported by participants
• Health-related quality of life
• Self-esteem
• Participants views of the intervention
• Behaviour change, if reported by participants
We defined the following outcomes as potentially investigator-
assessed outcomes.
• Changes in BMI and weight, if measured by trial personnel
• Adverse events, if measured by trial personnel
• All-cause mortality
• Morbidity
• Behaviour change, if measured by trial personnel
Summary assessment of risk of bias
Risk of bias for a trial across outcomes: some ’Risk of bias’ do-
mains such as selection bias (sequence generation and allocation
sequence concealment), affect the risk of bias across all outcome
measures in a trial. In case of high risk of selection bias, we marked
all endpoints investigated in the associated trial as high risk. Oth-
erwise, we did not perform a summary assessment of the risk of
bias across all outcomes for a trial.
Risk of bias for an outcome within a trial and across domains:
we assessed the risk of bias for an outcome measure by including
all entries relevant to that outcome (i.e. both trial-level entries and
outcome-specific entries). We considered low risk of bias to denote
a low risk of bias for all key domains, unclear risk to denote an
unclear risk of bias for one or more key domains and high risk to
denote a high risk of bias for one or more key domains.
Risk of bias for an outcome across trials and across domains:
these were our main summary assessments that we incorporated
intoourjudgementsaboutthe qualityof evidence inthe ’Summary
of finding’ tables. We defined outcomes as at low risk of bias when
most information came from trials at low risk of bias, unclear risk
when most information came from trials at low or unclear risk of
bias, and high risk when a sufficient proportion of information
came from trials at high risk of bias.
Measures of treatment effect
When at least two included trials were available for a comparison
and a given outcome, we expressed dichotomous data as a risk
ratio (RR) or odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).
For continuous outcomes measured on the same scale (e.g. weight
loss in kg) we estimated the intervention effect using the mean
difference with 95% CI. For continuous outcomes measuring the
same underlying concept (e.g. health-related quality of life) but
using different measurement scales, we calculated the standard-
ised mean difference (SMD). We expressed time-to-event data as
hazard ratio with 95% CI.
Unit of analysis issues
We took into account the level at which randomisation occurred,
such as cross-over trials, cluster-randomised trials and multiple
observations for the same outcome. If more than one comparison
from the same trial was eligible for inclusion in the same meta-
analysis, we either combined groups to create a single pair-wise
comparison (if the groups were suitably similar interventions) or
appropriately reduced the sample size so that the same participants
did not contribute multiple times (splitting the ’shared’ group
into two or more groups). While the latter approach offers some
solution to adjusting the precision of the comparison, it does not
account for correlation arising from the same set of participants
being in multiple comparisons (Deeks 2011).
We analysedclusterRCTsseparatelyfromindividuallyrandomised
trials.

 Dealing with missing data
If possible, we obtained missing data from the authors of the in-
cluded trials. We carefully evaluated important numerical data
such as screened, eligible, randomly-assigned participants as well
as intention-to-treat, as-treated and per-protocol populations. We
investigatedattritionrates(e.g.dropouts, lossesto follow-up, with-
drawals), and we critically appraised issues concerning missing
data and use of imputation methods (e.g. last observation carried
forward).
Where standard deviations for outcomes were not reported, and
we did not receive information from trial authors, we calculated
these following the methods presented in the Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011c). Where pa-
pers did not report results as change from baseline, we calculated
this and for the standard deviation differences followed the meth-
ods presented in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions for imputing these (Section 16.1.3.2 Imputing stan-
dard deviations for changes from baseline; Higgins 2011c), and
assumed a correlation of 0.5 between baseline and follow-up mea-
sures as suggested by Follmann 1992.
Assessment of heterogeneity
In the event of substantial clinical, methodological or statistical
heterogeneity, we did not report trial results as the pooled effect
estimate in a meta-analysis.
We identified heterogeneity (inconsistency) by visually inspecting
the forest plots and by using a standard Chi² test with a significance
level of α=0.1(Higgins 2002). Inviewof the lowpowerof thistest,
we also considered the I² statistic (Higgins 2003), which quantifies
inconsistency across trials to assess the impact of heterogeneity on
the meta-analysis, where an I² statistic of 75% or more indicates
a considerable level of inconsistency (Deeks 2011).
When we found heterogeneity, we attempted to determine po-
tential reasons for it by examining individual study and subgroup
characteristics.
Assessment of reporting biases
If we included 10 studies or more for a given outcome, we used
funnel plots to assess small study effects. Due to several explana-
tions for funnel plot asymmetry we interpreted results carefully
(Sterne 2011).
Data synthesis
We undertook a meta-analysis only if we judged participants, in-
terventions, comparisons and outcomes to be sufficiently similar.
We included all relevant trials regardless of risk of bias assessments
using random-effect models; subgrouping was undertaken accord-
ing to risk of bias (high, low, unclear risk). We performed statisti-
cal analyses according to the statistical guidelines presented in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks
2011).
Quality of evidence
We have presented the overall quality of the evidence for
each outcome specified under ’Types of outcome measures:
Summary of findings’ according to the GRADE approach (
gradeworkinggroup.org), which takes into account issues related
to internal validity (risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, pub-
lication bias) and also to external validity, such as directness of
results. Two review authors (EM, TB) independently rated the
quality of the evidence for each outcome. We have presented a
summary of the evidence in a ’Summary of findings’ table. This
provides key information about the best estimate of the magnitude
of the effect, in relative terms and as absolute differences, for each
relevant comparison of alternative management strategies, num-
bers of participants and trials that address each important out-
come and a rating of overall confidence in effect estimates for each
outcome. We created the ’Summary of findings’ table based on the
methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Re-
views of Interventions (Schünemann 2011) using Review Manager
5 (RevMan 5) table editor (RevMan 2014). We have included an
appendix titled ’Checklist to aid consistency and reproducibility
of GRADE assessments’ (Meader 2014), to help with standardisa-
tion of the ’Summary of findings’ tables. Alternatively, we planned
to use the GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool (GDT) soft-
ware (GRADEproGDT 2015) and would have presented evidence
profile tables as an appendix. We have presented results for the
outcomes as described in the Types of outcome measures section.
If meta-analysis was not possible, we presented the results narra-
tively in the ’Summary of findings’ table. We justified all decisions
to downgrade the quality of trials using footnotes and we made
comments to aid the reader’s understanding of the Cochrane Re-
view where necessary.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We expected the following characteristics to introduce clinical het-
erogeneity, and we planned to carry out the following subgroup
analyses including investigation of interactions (Altman 2003).
• Type of control (no treatment, usual care or another
intervention with the same components)
• Type of intervention (diet, physical activity and/or
behavioural therapy)
• Attrition bias (low, high, unclear)
• Setting
• Duration of post-intervention follow-up
• Parental involvement
• Baseline BMI z score
There isnosingle acceptedclassificationforsevere obesityinschool
children; we used the 2.67 BMI z score which equates to the
99.6th centile for severe obesity (Ells 2015a). We put studies into

 subgroups based on a whether their mean baseline BMI z score
was less than 2.67 units, or 2.67 units or over.
Sensitivity analysis
We investigated the impact of imputation on meta-analyses by per-
forming sensitivity analyses, and we reported per outcome which
trials were included with imputed SDs.

Results of the search
One overarching search was conducted for all the behaviour-
changing reviews:
• Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the
treatment of overweight or obesity in adolescents aged 12 to 17
years.
• Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the
treatment of overweight or obesity in schoolchildren from the
age of 6 to 11 years.
• Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the
treatment of overweight or obesity in preschool children up to
the age of 6 years.
• Parent-only interventions for childhood overweight or
obesity.
Our comprehensive literature searches identified 25,483 records,
after duplicates were removed this left 16,106 records. From these
15,491 records were excluded based on the title/abstract. We ob-
tained 615 records as full-text articles and screened them for in-
clusion or exclusion (see Figure 1 for the PRISMA flow diagram)
(Liberati 2009). We included 70 trials (164 articles) in the review
and 55 trials in the meta-analyses. Twenty trials are awaiting clas-
sification (Characteristics of studies awaiting classification) and 20
trials are ongoing (Characteristics of ongoing studies).

 Ongoing studies
We found 20 ongoing RCTs, see Characteristics of ongoing
studies. All but one are parallel RCTs. Five of the 20 ongoing
studies only include participants within the age range of this re-
view (between six years and less than 12 years). This includes:
ChiCTR-IOB-15005874; NCT01642836; NCT02258126;
NCT02343367; RBR-8ttw64. Eleven studies have age ranges
which include children 12 years or older. This includes:
DRKS00007879 (8 years to 16 years old), Moore 2013 (11
years to 12 years old), NCT01221220 (8 years to 15 years old),
NCT01574352 (10yearsto13yearsold),NCT01736748 (6years
to 18 years old), ACTRN12613001037796 (7 years to 16 years
old), NCT02082080 (9 years to 14 years old), NCT02560493
(10 years to 12 years old), NCT02711488 (9 years to 15 years old),
NCT02720302 (9 years to 12 years old), and NCT02773823
(8 years to 12 years old). Three studies include children younger
than six years old: ISRCTN81798055 (4 years to 11 years old),
NCT02573142 (5 years to 11 years old), and NCT02684214 (4
years to 10 years old). In addition, one study has an age range
that include children both younger and older than six years to
less than 12 years old: NCT02124460 (2 years to 12.9 years old).
Many studies include both overweight and obese participants,
while eight studies only include obese participants. In one ongoing
trial (NCT02720302) only overweight children are included.
The
majority
of
interventions
(N
=
14)
have
a
be-
havioural, diet and physical activity component. The remain-
ing studies are diet and exercise component only (ChiCTR-
IOB-15005874; NCT02082080; RBR-8ttw64), physical ac-
tivity and behavioural only (NCT01736748), physical activ-
ity only (ACTRN12613001037796) and behavioural only (
DRKS00007879; no mention of a diet or physical activity com-
ponent). Eleven studies have a usual care/standard treatment
control group while four studies include a no-treatment con-
trol group (NCT02082080; NCT02560493; NCT02711488;
NCT02773823). The remaining five trials compare a be-
haviour-changing intervention plus component with the same
behaviour-changing intervention without the additional com-
ponent (DRKS00007879; NCT01221220; NCT02560493;
NCT02684214; NCT02720302). The most common primary
outcome is BMI/BMI z score (N = 17 trials). No trial reported
adverse events as a primary outcome.
Studies awaiting classification
Twenty studies are awaiting classification. Seventeen trials were
identified on a clinical trial register website as completed; however,
no results are available. For the remaining three studies we were
unable to obtain a full publication; therefore, we are unable to
assess whether the trial met the inclusion of this review.
Included studies
We have presented a detailed description of the characteristics of
the 70 included trials in Characteristics of included studies, and in
Appendix 2; Appendix 3; Appendix 4. The following is a succinct
overview.
Source of data
We obtained the majority of data presented in the review from
published literature, including supplementary published data and
trials registers where available. Some data were requested from
study authors (see Appendix 11 for an overview). Only one study
did not have data published in a journal article and all data were
obtained from the clinical trial record (NCT02436330).
Comparisons
Of the 70 studies included in this review, only 21 studies included
a true control; hence, the control groups received no treatment
throughout the duration of the study (Arauz Boudreau 2013;
Boutelle 2014; Bryant 2011; Coppins 2011; Croker 2012; de Niet
2012; Eddy Ives 2012; Epstein 1984a; Maddison 2011; Maddison
2014; Markert 2014; McCallum 2007; Nowicka 2009; Reinehr
2010; Sacher 2010; Satoh 2007; Siwik 2013; Vann 2013; Wafa
2011; Wake 2009; Wake 2013).
Control group participants in 34 studies were given usual/standard
care, either as defined by the study authors or assessed by the
review authors (Alves 2008; Barkin 2011; Berry 2014; Davis
2013; Davoli 2013; Diaz 2010; Epstein 2000a; Faude 2010; Gillis

The remaining 15 studies (Bathrellou 2010; Berry 2007; Duffy
1993; Duggins 2010; Epstein 1985a; Epstein 1985b; Epstein
1985c; Epstein 2001; Epstein 2005; Epstein 2015; Flodmark

2004) included a control condition in which the participants re-
ceived an intervention that was also provided in the interven-
tion group, with the intervention group also receiving an addi-
tional component (for example, diet plus physical activity plus be-
havioural therapy versus diet plus physical activity). Five of these
trials had multiple comparator arms and could also be evaluated
as intervention versus control (either usual care or no treatment)
(Epstein 1984a; Epstein 2000a; Looney 2014; Taveras 2015; Vann

 2013); hence, both comparator types were evaluated where appro-
priate.
Overview of trial populations
Individual study sample size at randomisation ranged from 16
(eight in the intervention group, eight in the control group)
(Gunnarsdottir 2011a) to 686 (336 in the intervention group, 350
in the control group) (Warschburger 2016). Twenty-one studies
had a sample size less than 50 at baseline, 21 studies had between
50 and 100 participants, 17 studies had between 100 and 200 par-
ticipants, four studies had between 200 and 300 participants, and
finally, seven studies had more than 300 participants at baseline;
these includedBerry2014; Davoli2013; Maddison 2011; Markert
2014; Taveras 2015; Warschburger 2016 and Wright 2012. Only
39 studies clearlyreported using a power calculation in their meth-
ods; only 10 of these studies actually achieved their target sample
size at follow-up, after dropout (Croker 2012; Davis 2013; Davoli
2013; Hughes 2008; Lison 2012; McCallum 2007; Nemet 2005;
Wafa 2011; Wilfley 2007; Wright 2012).
A total of 8461 participants were randomised to either the inter-
vention or control groups. In three studies, it was unclear how
many participants were measured at the endpoint (i.e. completed
the whole study) (Berry 2014, Epstein 2015, Woo 2004). There-
fore, in the remaining 67 studies, 5960 participants out of the
7997 randomised were measured at the study’s endpoint (74.5%).
The endpoints varied across studies with the shortest follow-up
time from baseline being 24 weeks and the longest being three
years. The number and proportions of participants completing
the study, where reported, ranged from 2899 participants (71.9%)
in the intervention groups and 2737 participants (76.9%) in the
control groups.
Trial design
All 70 studies had a superiority design. All but six studies were
parallel RCTs; four studies (Berry 2007; Berry2014; Taveras 2015;
Wright 2012) were cluster RCTs. Coppins 2011 and Siwik 2013
were presented as cross-over trials; these were treated as parallel
RCTs where only the first phase was analysed before crossover and
the control groups were treated as waiting-list controls.
Twenty trials were multi-centre (Barkin 2011; Berry 2014; Davis
2013; Davoli 2013; de Niet 2012; Duggins 2010; Eddy Ives 2012;
Gillis 2007; Hamilton-Shield 2014; Larsen 2015; McCallum
2007; O’Connor 2013; Reinehr 2010; Sacher 2010; Satoh 2007;
Serra-Paya 2015; Taveras 2015; Wake 2009; Wake 2013; Wright
2012), ranging from 2 to 69 centres.
Trials were published between 1984 and 2016.
One study (Hamilton-Shield 2014) was terminated before the
endpoint due to recruitment issues and technical problems with
the intervention equipment.
The length of the interventions ranged from 10 days to two years.
Just over half (N = 37) trials had a period of post intervention fol-
low-up (defined as the period after the active intervention and up
to the final measurement) with a median duration of 10 months;
follow-up from end of the intervention period ranged from one
month to two years. We did not extract any information on
whether the post-intervention period was passive (i.e. just mea-
surement) or active (i.e. a maintenance intervention period with
the aim of helping children to sustain the weight status they had
achieved).
Settings
Thirty of the included studies were conducted in the USA, six in
the UK, five in Germany, four in Australia, three each in Swe-
den, New Zealand and Spain, and two each in Israel and in Italy.
The remaining studies were conducted in Austria, Brazil, Canada,
Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hong Kong, Iceland, Japan, Malaysia,
Mexico and the Netherlands. Twenty-five studies were conducted
in secondary care, eleven in primary care, seven in university re-
search clinics, seven in the community, four in homes and four in
schools. Ten studies were based in more than one setting and in
two studies the setting was unclear (Duffy 1993, NCT02436330).
Participants
All participants included in this review were overweight, obese
or severely obese at baseline; various diagnostic criteria were ap-
plied across the trials. Thirty-two studies included children who
were overweight or obese (including morbidly obese) while 26
studies only included children who were obese (including mor-
bidly obese). Overweight children only (not obese) were included
in five studies (Davoli 2013; Duffy 1993; Faude 2010; Larsen
2015; Reinehr 2010). Six studies included both overweight and
obese children but did not include morbidly/severely obese chil-
dren (Eddy Ives 2012; Epstein 2001; McCallum 2007; O’Connor
2013; Saelens 2013; Wake 2009). Only one study included just
severely obese children (Kalarchian 2009).
All but three studies were conducted in upper-income countries
(defined using the World Bank classification). Alves 2008; Diaz
2010 and Wafa 2011 included participants from upper middle-
income countries.
Of the 38 studies that clearly reported the ethnic group(s) of their
participants, six studies reported that all of their participants were
white (Coppins 2011; Epstein 1985a; Epstein 1985b; Epstein
1985c; Lison 2012; Warschburger 2016). In 23 studies partici-
pants were of mixed ethnic groups, but the majority ethnic group
was white ( Alves 2008; Boutelle 2014; Bryant 2011; Croker
2012; Davis 2013; Epstein 2000; Epstein 2001; Epstein 2005;
Hamilton-Shield 2014; Kalarchian 2009; Kirk 2012; Lochrie
2013; Looney 2014; NCT02436330; Reinehr 2010; Rodearmel
2007; Sacher 2010; Saelens 2013; Siwik 2013; Taveras 2015;
Wake 2009; Wake 2013; Wilfley 2007). Berry 2007 had a similar
number of white and black participants, and also some Hispanic

 participants. Berry 2014 and Vann 2013 had a higher percentage
of African American children in their studies while O’Connor
2013 had a higher percentage of Hispanic/Latino/Mexican Amer-
ican participants. In Mirza 2013, Weintraub 2008 and Wright
2012, the majority of participants were Hispanic/Latino. Woo
2004 included participants who were all Hong Kong Chinese and
Wafa 2011 included participants who were of Malay ethnicity.
The mean age (SD) of participants at baseline ranged from 6.2
(1.2) years (Larsen 2015) to 11.9 (2.4) years (Berry 2007), with
the majority of studies including participants with a mean age over
nine years but under 12 years of age; only 17 studies included
participants with a mean age under nine years old (Alves 2008;
Bryant 2011; Coppins 2011; Davis 2013; Davoli 2013; Epstein
1985c; Hughes 2008; Kalavainen 2007; Larsen 2015; Looney
2014; McCallum 2007; Nova 2001; O’Connor 2013; Taylor
2015; Wake 2009; Wake 2013; Wright 2012). One study (Lison
2012) had three groups with one group having a mean age of 12.3
years; however, the average age across all three groups fell under
the cut-off of 12 years.
Twenty-six studies had roughly an equal number of boys and girls
at baseline, while in 27 studies, 55% to 69% of participants were
female at baseline. In six studies, there were 70% or more girls
at baseline; this included two studies that only recruited girls (
Epstein 1985b; Epstein 1985c). Seven studies had more boys than
girls at baseline but only two of these had more than 70% boys
(Davis 2013; Maddison 2011). No study included boys only. In
five studies it was unclear how many boys and girls were included
at baseline (Epstein 1984a; Gunnarsdottir 2011a; Nowicka 2009;
Weintraub 2008). Socioeconomicstatuswasrecordedin32studies
at baseline (no studies reported on socioeconomic effects as an
outcome); however, the variables and tools used varied greatly
between the studies.
Mean BMI or BMI z score, or both, at baseline were reported in
63 studies. Mean BMI (kg/m2) value at baseline ranged from 18.3
kg/m2 to 41.1 kg/m2 in the intervention group and 18.2 kg/m2
to 36.7 kg/m2 in the control group with a median values of 26.6
kg/m2 and 26.5 kg/m2, respectively. Mean BMI z score at baseline
ranged from 1.3 units to 5.6 units in the intervention group and
1.3 units to 5.3 units in the control group with median values of
2.2 units and 2.2 units, respectively. Only one study reported the
mean duration at which their participants had been overweight or
obese prior to starting the trial. Davoli 2013 reported 63.6% and
64.3% of intervention and control participants, respectively, were
overweight before five years old.
Comorbidites at baseline were reported in five studies (Eddy
Ives 2012; Gunnarsdottir 2011a; Kalavainen 2007; Satoh 2007;
Waling 2012) and included asthma, type 2 diabetes, metabolic
syndrome, depression, anxiety and fatty liver diagnoses. None of
the interventions had a pharmacological component; however par-
ticipants in all three groups in one study were encouraged to take
a vitamin/mineral supplement throughout the study (Kirk 2012).
Diagnosis
A number of different growth chart references/criteria were used
to categorise overweight and obesity. The ’United States Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) 2000 growth
reference’ ( cdc.gov/growthcharts) was used to define over-
weight and obesity in 31 studies while the ’International Obesity
Task Force ( IOTF) cut-offs’ ( worldobesity.org/resources/child-
obesity/newchildcutoffs) were used in 12 studies. Four studies
based in the UK used the ’British 1990 growth reference ( UK90)’
( noo.org.uk) to define the weight status categories (Bryant 2011;
Hamilton-Shield 2014; Hughes 2008; Sacher 2010), while only
one study used the ’World Health Organization ( WHO) Child
Growth Standard’ ( who.int/childgrowth) (Eddy Ives 2012). The
remaining studies used references specific to their country, raw
BMI or percentage overweight cut off references - but in four
studies it was unclear which growth references were used to define
overweight and obesity (Duffy 1993; Ho 2016; NCT02436330;
Schwingshandl 1999).
Interventions
The majority of studies in this review had a behavioural, diet
and physical activity component (N = 49). Two studies included
both a behavioural and diet component but had no physical activ-
ity (Boutelle 2014; Flodmark 1993). Barkin 2011 and Maddison
2014 were the only studies to have both a behavioural and phys-
ical activity intervention without a diet component. Four stud-
ies had only a physical activity arm (Alves 2008; Faude 2010;
Maddison 2011; Weintraub 2008). Eleven studies had no be-
havioural arm (Duggins 2010; Eddy Ives 2012; Kirk 2012; Larsen
2015; Lison 2012; Nova 2001; Nowicka 2009; Rodearmel 2007;
Schwingshandl 1999; Vann 2013; Woo 2004). Ho2016 andSatoh
2007 were the only studies to include a diet component alone.
The majority of studies (N = 65) included the child and par-
ent/caregiver (or child’s family). Four of these 65 studies involved
both the child and parent/caregiver; however, the main aim of the
intervention was to target the parent (McCallum 2007; Taveras
2015; Wafa 2011; Warschburger 2016). Five studies only in-
volved the child in the intervention and there was no input from
the parent/caregiver (Alves 2008; Faude 2010; Maddison 2011),
Schwingshandl 1999, Vann 2013). One study directly investigated
whether parental involvement or parental control would add ben-
efit to an intervention aimed at the child (Bathrellou 2010).
Participants in two studies were given treatment before randomi-
sation, this included de Niet 2012 where a behavioural-changing
treatment (BFC) programme was given to all participants, then
they were randomised to receive a short message service mainte-
nance treatment (via text messages) plus BFC follow-up sessions
or BFC follow-up sessions only for an additional nine months.
Wilfley 2007 included a weight-loss treatment and then partici-
pants were randomised to three different maintenance arms. These
two studies were the only two studies that specifically investigated
18

 the impact of a maintenance programme (rather than treatment
programme).
Treatments provided to the intervention and comparator groups
were mainly led (or co-led) by registered dietitians, therapists or
psychologists. Other professionals involved in providing treat-
ment included nutritionists, paediatricians, nurses, physical activ-
ity teachers/coaches, exercise consultants/specialists, undergradu-
ates/postgraduates studying nutrition or physical activity-related
or medical degrees, GPs, physicians, physiotherapists, exercise psy-
chologists, health educators/trainers, research assistants, trained
study members and community workers.
Outcomes
Fifty-one trials explicitly stated a primary/secondary endpoint in
their publications (Appendix 5). The most commonly defined pri-
mary outcome was BMI or BMI z score (SDS). A median of seven
outcomes was collected by the 70 studies, ranging between two
and 27 outcomes. All 70 studies measured at least one outcome
defined in this review - for a detailed description of how each out-
come was measured in each study see Appendix 7. A total of 67
studies reported measuring BMI or BMI z scores in their publi-
cations. Only six studies reported adverse events occurring (it was
unclear whether any adverse events occurred in 29 studies). Forty-
seven studies measured additional body fat distribution measures
such as waist circumference, body fat percentage and percent over-
weight. Fifty-six studies measured behaviour-change outcomes us-
ing validated tools, such as physical activity via accelerometrydata,
and dietary behaviours via food frequency questionnaires. Health-
related quality of life or self-esteem was measured by 21 studies,
while participants’ views of the intervention was reported by nine
studies. Only two studies reported morbidity data such as num-
ber of participants with metabolic syndrome. No studies reported
socioeconomic effects or all-cause mortality.
We found differences between defined primary outcomes in pub-
lication and trials registers/protocols eight studies (Boutelle 2014;
de Niet 2012; Epstein 2015; Kalarchian 2009; Kirk 2012; Lochrie
2013; Looney 2014; Taveras 2015) - see Appendix 5 and Appendix
6 for more details on outcome reporting bias.
Excluded studies
We excluded 402 full-text articles after evaluation, see
Characteristics of excluded studies. The main reasons for exclu-
sions was the trial not being an RCT, mean age was not six years
to less than 12 years old, the aim of the study was preventing over-
weight/obesity, and length of follow-up was less than six months
from baseline.

 Allocation
Forty-eight studies reported adequate sequence generation (i.e.
low risk), 20 were unclear, and two were high risk due to the
randomisation method they used. We rated 49 studies low risk (i.e.
adequate allocation concealment), 18 were unclear and three were
high risk of allocation concealment. Overall, the risk of selection
bias was low for 42 studies, unclear for 26 studies and high for
two studies (Gillis 2007; Lison 2012).
Blinding
Forty-four studies did not blind their participants or study person-
nel to study group allocation with regards to objective measures
and we assessed them as high risk. We rated 23 studies as unclear
and three studies as low risk for performance bias because par-
ticipants and study personnel were both blinded to study group
allocation. With regards to subjective measures, we judged all bias
assessments to be at the same level of risk as the objective measures
unless a study did not have any subjective outcomes, then the risk
was left blank in the risk of bias table and figures (this also applied
to detection and attrition bias).
Outcome assessors collecting objective outcomes were blinded to
the study group in 21 studies and we assessed them as low risk,
while in 21 studies it was unclear whether outcome assessment was
blinded; we rated 28 studies as high risk of detection bias because
outcome assessment was not blinded. If a study had subjective
outcomes, then we gave the detection bias assessment the same
classification as for objective measures.
Incomplete outcome data
Dropout rates were classed as low if less than 15%; high if more
than 25% in studies with follow-up from baseline of six to 12
months or more than 30% in studies with over 12 months’ follow-
up; unclear if more than 15% but less than 25% in studies with
follow-up from six to 12 months, or less than 30% in studies with
follow-up more than 12 months. We also took into consideration
whether a study used intention-to-treat and also what method it
used to impute missing data. For objective outcomes, we rated 27
studies as low risk; 24 studies at high risk; and 19 studies at unclear
risk.
Selective reporting
To assess selective outcome reporting we checked whether publi-
cations reported outcomes described in the publication itself and
in a protocol/clinical trials register entry. We rated 17 studies as
low risk because they provided results for all outcomes described.
Studies could only be rated as low risk if they had published a pro-
tocol or registered the trial on a clinical trials website because there
was no other way to determine if the publication had reported all
outcomes intended to be measured.
We classified 14 studies as having a high risk of selective outcome
reporting. In Kalarchian 2009 the clinical trials register stated BMI
and cardiovascular risk factors as the primary outcome; however,
in the publication it was percentage overweight. In Barkin 2011
they did not report BMI outcome results for the intervention and
control groups separately, only for the group combined. Epstein
2000a also combined all three groups together in the additional
publication (Epstein 2001), likely due to non-significant results.
Lochrie 2013 did not report raw data at baseline and follow-up (or
mean change) for each group, while Gunnarsdottir 2011a failed to
compare intervention and control outcomes and did not present
raw results for many of its intended measured outcomes, includ-
ing health-related quality of life. Reinehr 2010 did not provide
quality-of-life measures separately for each group. Mirza 2013 also
failed to present the results for many of its outcomes, including
outcomes described on a clinical trials website. Croker 2012 also
did not provide the results for all outcomes reported on the clinical
trials website. Nova 2001 did not provide behavioural outcome
results at follow-up, or results at 24 months’ follow-up (endpoint)
while Schwingshandl 1999 did not provide any BMI data at the
study’s endpoint (12 months). Hamilton-Shield 2014 terminated
the trial before its endpoint; however, it failed to provide any data
on outcomes collected before termination.
The remaining 39 studies we rated as unclear risk of selective out-
come reporting bias primarily because the trial protocol was not
published in advance of the study or registered on a clinical tri-
als website. There were however, additional reasons why we clas-
sified risk of bias as unclear: Boutelle 2014 had a clinical trials
entry but we rated it as unclear because the entry stated that there
were three intervention groups and one control group; however,
in the publication there was only one intervention and one con-
trol group. In addition, Bryant 2011; Coppins 2011; Eddy Ives
2012; Markert 2014; Wake 2009 and Warschburger 2016 had
clinical trials entries but they were retrospectively entered, while
O’Connor 2013 only provided one outcome measure (family at-
tendance) on its clinical trials register entry. Potential bias may
also occur in Coppins 2011 due to only reporting some outcomes
as significant or non-significant (no raw results). Looney 2014
reported measuring cost-effectiveness on the clinical trials entry;
however, this is not reported in the publication. In addition Sacher
2010; Serra-Paya 2015 and Taveras 2015 reported a number of
outcomes in their clinical trials register entries that were not re-
ported in the main publications.
Other potential sources of bias
21
Diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obese children from the age of 6 to 11 years
(Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 We rated 60 studies as unclear, mainly because of a lack of detail
in the publication or an unclear risk of bias for the other domains
resulting in uncertainty of the presence of other biases. Six stud-
ies were low risk because the trials were generally well-conducted
and well-reported (Ho 2016; McCallum 2007; Serra-Paya 2015;
Taveras 2015; Wake 2009; Wake 2013). Four studies were high
risk - Berry 2007 and Wright 2012 were cluster RCTs but did not
adjust for clustering in their analyses, Woo 2004 non-randomly
split their intervention group into two groups at six weeks, and
Hamilton-Shield 2014 was terminated before the study’s endpoint
because of problems with recruitment and equipment.

Behaviour-changing interventions versus no
treatment or usual care
Fifty-five trials compared behaviour-changing (diet and/or physi-
cal activity and/or behavioural therapy) interventions, usual care,
enhanced usual care, information control, or wait-list control. Ex-
cluding cluster RCTs and weight maintenance trials (N = 5) there
were 20 trials in which the control groups received no treatment
throughout the duration of the study and 30 trials in which the
control group participants were given usual care, either defined by
the trial author or assessed by the review authors. We considered
outcomes here at the longest follow-up point reported for each
trial.
Primary outcomes
Changes in body mass index (BMI), BMI z score and body
weight
Twenty-four trials reported BMI change data that could be meta-
analysed. Pooling the effects in a random-effects meta-analysis
(Analysis 1.1; Figure 4) demonstrated a reduction in BMI in the
intervention groups compared with controls at the final follow-
up: MD -0.53 kg/m2 (95% CI -0.82 to -0.24); P = 0.0004; 24
trials; 2785 participants; low-quality evidence.

 Thirty-seven trials reported BMI z score change data that could
be meta-analysed. Pooling the effects in a random-effects meta-
analysis (Analysis 1.2; Figure 5) demonstrated a reduction in BMI
z score in the intervention groups compared with controls at the
final follow-up: MD -0.06 units (95% CI -0.10 to -0.02); P =

Seventeen trials reported data on change in body weight that could
be meta-analysed. Pooling the effects in a random-effects meta-
analysis (Analysis 1.3; Figure 6) demonstrated a reduction in body
weight in the intervention groups compared with controls at the fi-
nal follow-up: MD -1.45 kg (95% CI -1.88 to -1.02); P < 0.00001;
17 trials; 1774 participants; low-quality evidence.

Change in weight (all trials)
Some meta-analyses revealed substantial heterogeneity which we
explored by subgroup analysis by type of control, type of inter-
vention, risk of attrition bias, setting of intervention and period
of post-intervention follow-up. The heterogeneity was not fully
explained by any of these factors (see “Subgroup analyses” section
below).
We were unable to include nine trials with no treatment or usual
care control groups in the BMI and BMI z score meta-analyses and
so they are narratively reported: Satoh 2007, Epstein 1984a and
Nova 2001 only presented data for percent overweight. Nowicka
2009 reported no differences in follow-up outcome measures be-
tween the intervention and control groups. We could not include
Vann 2013 in the meta-analyses because they did not provide SDs
for BMI values at baseline and follow-up (or effect sizes and P
values). A small decrease of 0.1 kg/m2 was seen in the pedometer
plus DVD group; however, an increase in BMI was observed in
the two other intervention groups and the control group. Barkin
2011 only provided BMI data for the intervention and control
groups combined - in a linear regression model they observed that
parent-child dyads in the control group were more likely to de-
crease their BMI over the six-month study. Lochrie 2013 only pro-
vided means and standard errors at follow-up - the SD at baseline
was unclear. The study found a larger reduction in BMI z score at
12 months’ follow-up in the intervention group. Finally, Hughes
2008 only presented change in BMI z score as median and IQR,
which cannot be converted into mean and SD (or 95% CI). At six
months and 12 months the median difference between groups was
not substantially different (P = 0.4 and P = 0.5, respectively). No
BMI/BMI z score data were available in Hamilton-Shield 2014
because the study was terminated.
In the weight meta-analyses, we were unable to include Hughes
2008 as this study only presented weight data as median and IQR
- a non-substantial difference between groups was found at both
six months’ and 12 months’ follow-up (P = 0.1 and P = 0.9, re-
spectively). In addition, Lison 2012 did not provide any SD values
for weight at follow-up so could not be included in the analyses.
The control group increased their weight over the six-month pe-
riod while a smaller increase in weight was seen in the hospital
clinic group along with a small reduction in weight in the home-
based group. Epstein 1984a provided weight data in an additional
secondary analysis paper; however, they only presented data for
the two intervention groups. Hence, we decided not to include
these data in the weight meta-analyses because data were not re-
ported for the control group. The authors found a reduction in
weight in the two treatment groups combined. We were unable to
include the remaining studies in the weight meta-analysis because
no weight data were provided in the publications.
Adverse events
The majority of publications did not report whether or not any
adverse events occurred; hence, we had to contact most study
authors to obtain this information. As a result, it was confirmed
that no adverse events occurred in 28 trials with a no-treatment/
usual-care control group. In 16 trials it was unclear whether any
adverse events had occurred. The remaining six studies reported
adverse events occurring: Maddison 2011 and Maddison 2014
provided data on serious adverse events, as described below. Croker
2012 reported that one participant in the control group had a very
high reduction in BMI and standardised BMI (BMI SDS). Kirk

 2012 reported that some participants in both groups developed
elevated triglycerides (12.2%), elevated blood pressure (3.6%),
elevated LDL cholesterol (3.5%) and/or elevated fasting glucose
(3.5%); however, there were no substantial differences by group.
Weintraub 2008 reported that three adverse events occurred in
the intervention group (skin rash, diagnosis of hypothyroidism,
car collision) and six events in the control group (foot injury, eye
pain and headaches, ingrown toenail, ear infection, knee pain, skin
rash); however, none of these were considered to be related to the
study, and it was unclear if any of these were considered serious
adverse events. Mirza 2013 reported that no serious adverse events
occurred; however, one child in the control group reported feeling
faint during the three-month blood taking. Adverse events and
the level of severity were author-assessed, often using pre-defined
criteria; however, these criteria varied between the studies leading
to potential inconsistency between the studies and this should be
borne in mind when evaluating the adverse events outcomes.
Thirty-one trials reported serious adverse event data that could
be meta-analysed. Pooling the effects in a random-effects meta-
analysis (Analysis 1.4) demonstrated a RR of 0.57 (95% CI 0.17
to 1.93); P = 0.37; 31 trials; 4096 participants; low-quality evi-
dence), in favour of the intervention group. Only two of the 31
trials reported any serious adverse events; the other 29 reported
zero serious adverse events. Serious adverse events were reported
by Maddison 2011 and these included seasonal influenza that re-
quired hospitalisation (N = 3), hip surgery due to a chronic condi-
tion (N = 1), an ankle injury (N = 1), diagnosis of type 1 diabetes
(N = 1), a blood clot (N = 1) and observation after a fall (N = 1);
none of these were seen as related to the study. Maddison 2014
also reported a small number of serious adverse events but none
of these were considered as related to the study; they included two
events in the intervention group (bowel replacement surgery and a
dislocated hip) and three events in the control group (an operation
to remove a cyst, a broken ankle, and two broken fingers).
These data were based on the total number of participants who
suffered at least one serious adverse event (4/2105 participants
in the behaviour-changing intervention groups compared with 7/
1991 participants in the comparator groups). We were unable to
include studies where they reported adverse events but did not
define if they were serious or if they did not provide the number
of participants in each group who had at least one adverse event.
We aimed to provide a meta-analysis showing the number of par-
ticipants in each group who discontinued due to adverse events.
However, of those studies that reported adverse events occur-
ring, only three actually reported if any participants discontinued
(Croker 2012; Mirza 2013; Weintraub 2008) and theyall reported
that no participants dropped out due to adverse events.
Secondary outcomes
Health-related quality of life and self-esteem
Appendix 13 details the instruments that were used for analysis
of health-related quality of life in the included trials. However,
we were unable to meta-analyse all of the studies for the follow-
ing reasons: unable to calculate mean change from data provided
(Wake 2013, Warschburger 2016); no raw data were provided
(Bryant 2011; Hamilton-Shield 2014; Lochrie 2013; Markert
2014; Reinehr 2010), no SDs given (Arauz Boudreau 2013), the
study only presented results via domains, not overall score (Taylor
2015), and data were presented as median and interquartile ranges
(IQR) (Hughes 2008). Four trials (Croker 2012, McCallum 2007;
Wafa 2011; Wake 2009) reported the Pediatric Quality of Life
Inventory (PedsQL) generic core scales, using the total score, ei-
ther via parental or child report (Analysis 1.5; Analysis 1.6). An
additional study measured health-related quality of life using the
CHQ-PF50 global score (parental-report) (Kalarchian 2009) and
Faude 2010 used the KINDL-R questionnaire (child-report). Us-
ing standardised mean differences (SMD), there were no substan-
tial differences between intervention and control (higher scores
indicate better quality of life) in the change in health-related qual-
ity of life at the final follow-up for parent/caregiver-reported data,
demonstrating a SMD of 0.13 units (95% CI -0.06 to 0.32);
P = 0.17; 5 trials; 718 participants; low-quality evidence. There
were no substantial differences between intervention and control
(higherscoresindicate betterqualityof life)inthe change inhealth-
related quality of life at the final follow-up for child-reported data,
demonstrating a SMD of 0.15 units (95% CI -0.34 to 0.64); P
= 0.55; 3 trials; 164 participants; very low-quality evidence. The
minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for a PedsQL
child’s self-report is 4.36 units and for PedsQL parents’ (proxy)
report 4.50 units (Varni 2007); when converting the SMD back
to raw units, the MCID was not met in either meta-analysis.
Twotrialsreportedameasure of self-esteemusingthe Harterglobal
score that could be meta-analysed (Analysis 1.7). There were no
substantial differences between intervention and control (higher
scores indicate better self-esteem) in the change in self-esteem
found at the final follow-up, demonstrating a MD of 0.19 units
(95% CI -0.04 to 0.42); P = 0.11; 2 trials; 144 participants; very
low-quality evidence.
All-cause mortality
No deaths were reported in any of the trials.
Morbidity
No trials measured morbidities.
However, metabolic syndrome (which is a composite of risk indi-
cators such as elevated blood lipids, insulin resistance, obesity and
high blood pressure) was mentioned in Mirza 2013 using the Na-
tional Cholesterol Education Program (Adult treatment panel III).
Approximately 40% of the low glycaemic index dietary group (in-
tervention) and 30% of the low fat dietary group (comparator) had

 the metabolic syndrome at baseline; at 24 months there was slight
reduction in the percentage of participants with metabolic syn-
drome in both groups. However, there were no substantial differ-
ences between groups. Waling 2012 also measured the metabolic
syndrome prevalence at baseline and follow-up using the Inter-
national Diabetes Federation (IDF) definition. At baseline one
participant in the intervention group and two participants in the
control group had the metabolic syndrome; at one year’s follow-
up the number of participants with the metabolic syndrome was
three in the intervention group and two in the control group.
Anthropometric measures other than change in BMI
Eleven trials reported waist circumference data that could be meta-
analysed (Analysis 1.8). Meta-analysis demonstrated a reduction
in waist circumference in the intervention groups compared with
controls at the final follow-up: MD -2.41 cm (95% CI -3.59 to -
1.23); P < 0.0001; 11 trials; 1325 participants.
Three trials reported percentage overweight data that could be
meta-analysed (Analysis 1.9). Meta-analysis demonstrated no sub-
stantial difference in percentage overweight in the intervention
groups compared with controls at the final follow-up: MD -3.27%
(95% CI -7.47 to 0.92); P = 0.13; 3 trials; 347 participants).
Eleven trials reported percentage body fat data that could be meta-
analysed (Analysis 1.10). Meta-analysis demonstrated no substan-
tial difference in percentage body fat in the intervention groups
compared with controls at the final follow-up using (1) bioelectri-
cal impedance analysis: MD -1.25% (95% CI -2.62 to 0.12); P =
0.07; 5 trials; 1004 participants; and (2) using dual energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DEXA): MD -1.04% (95% CI -2.88 to 0.80); P
= 0.27; 5 trials; 443 participants.
Behaviour change
Two trials reported total kcals per day data that could be meta-
analysed (Analysis 1.11). Meta-analysis demonstrated no substan-
tial difference in total kcals per day in the intervention groups
compared with controls at the final follow-up: MD -161.53 total
kcals/day (95% CI -583.79 to 260.73); P = 0.45; 2 trials; 168
participants.
Two trials reported total minutes per day for television viewing
data that could be meta-analysed (Analysis 1.12). Meta-analysis
demonstrated a reduction in total minutes per day in the interven-
tion groups compared with controls at the final follow-up: MD -
6.60 minutes per day (95% CI -12.88 to -0.31); P = 0.04; 2 trials;
55 participants.
Six trials reported physical activity using accelerometers and total
minutes per day data that could be meta-analysed (Analysis 1.13).
Meta-analysis demonstrated no substantial difference in total min-
utes per day of physical activity in the intervention groups com-
pared with controls at the final follow-up: MD -0.76 minutes per
day (95% CI -5.30 to 3.78); P = 0.74; 6 trials; 744 participants.
Participants’ views of the intervention
Eight studies asked parents, the children or both for their views
on the intervention (or comparator) given. Gunnarsdottir 2011a
used an acceptability questionnaire to rate how satisfied families
were with the intervention; the majority gave ratings of 1 to 3
(Likert scale, 1 = very satisfied, 5 = not satisfied). The most liked
components were the individual sessions and the traffic light diet
food guide, and the least liked was a behavioural change technique
called “token economies” which were defined as establishing goals,
determining preferred rewards and providing them contingently
upon achieving behavioural goals) and self-monitoring diet and
physical activity.
Boutelle 2014 also asked all children and parents in the interven-
tion group whether they liked the intervention: 50% of children
liked the intervention a lot or loved it and 85% of them believed
other children would like the intervention; 67% of parents in the
intervention group liked it a lot or loved it, while 47% believed
their child liked it a lot. Participants in Looney 2014 also un-
dertook a process evaluation at the end of the study. There were
no substantial differences in ratings between the three groups and
90% of families rated the programme as very good or excellent;
90% also said it was easy to understand. O’Connor 2013 also re-
ported that 85% of the intervention group were positive about the
treatment given.
Satoh 2007 interviewed 17 out of 21 children who completed the
one-month intervention. Sixteen children said the intervention
was easy to understand; however 14 children said completing the
meal chart was a burden. Wake 2013 reported that the majority of
parents thought the clinicians and GPs providing the intervention
understood the challenges faced by the family and were confident
that the intervention would make a difference.
Bryant 2011 randomly selected 10% of their sample to answer
feedback about the study. The majority of parents and children
reported positive experiences; however, those in the waiting list
control group were disappointed that they had to wait for the in-
tervention. Children were generally positive about the assessment
but thought the worst part was the blood taking.
Hamilton-Shield 2014 collected qualitative data on treatment ac-
ceptance. The study involved an electrical device which included a
weighing scale to measure food and provided feedback on satiety.
Even though some parents gave some positive comments on the
intervention, there were many technical problems with the device
and some found it confusing to use. This may have contributed
to the early termination of the study.
Socioeconomic effects
No trials measured socioeconomic effects.
Behaviour-changing intervention plus additional

 These interventions had the same components in the intervention
and comparator groups to establish fair comparisons, and an ad-
ditive component in the intervention arm. For example, diet plus
physical activity plus behaviour therapy versus diet plus physical
activity (with behaviour therapy being the additive component).
We identified 15 trials in this category.
Of these studies, five studies also had a no-treatment or usual-care-
condition group as they were at least three-arm studies (Epstein
1984a; Epstein 2000a; Looney 2014; Taveras 2015; Vann 2013).
Davis 2013 compared the addition of telemedicine to standard
physician visits and Duggins 2010 investigated adding a YMCA
membership (physical activity) to nutrition classes led by dieti-
cians. Epstein 2015 investigated whether adding a different nutri-
tional component to a multi-component intervention was more
beneficial. One study compared whether increasing physical activ-
ityordecreasingsedentarybehaviourswasmore beneficial (Epstein
2001), while Epstein 1985a investigated adding a physical activity
component (aerobic or behaviour-changing activity) to diet and
behaviour therapy (with calisthenic exercise as a placebo).
Five studies investigated whether adding a physical activity
component to a nutritional intervention improved weight-re-
lated outcomes (Duggins 2010; Epstein 1984a; Epstein 1985b;
Schwingshandl 1999; Woo 2004). NCT02436330 added an ex-
ergaming component (classed as physical activity) to a didactic
health teaching intervention. Vann 2013 also included two trial
arms adding a physical activity component (fitness DVD or pe-
dometers).
Bathrellou 2010 investigated whether adding a parental involve-
ment to a diet and physical activity intervention would be ben-
eficial. Duffy 1993 added cognitive self-management to a be-
havioural intervention and Epstein 2005 added a behavioural ele-
ment with regards to alternative behaviours to eating. Behavioural
therapy was also an additional component in Epstein 1985c and
Flodmark 1993. Larsen 2015 added an educational consultation
to a diet and physical activity intervention, and Epstein 2000a
assessed adding problem solving with or without parental involve-
ment. Looney 2014 added a behavioural therapy component to a
growth-monitoring intervention. Taveras 2015 (cluster RCT) also
looked at adding individual family coaching to a clinical-support
intervention.
Primary outcomes
Changes in body mass index (BMI), BMI z score and weight
Four trials reported BMI data that could be meta-analysed
(Analysis 2.1). Meta-analysis demonstrated a reduction in BMI in
the intervention groups compared with controls at the final fol-
low-up: MD -0.75 kg/m2 (95% CI -1.42 to -0.09); P = 0.03; 4
trials; 195 participants.
Five trials reported BMI z score data that could be meta-analysed
(Analysis 2.2). Meta-analysis demonstrated no substantial differ-
ence in BMI z score in the intervention groups compared with
controls at the final follow-up: MD -0.03 units (95% CI -0.10 to
0.04); P = 0.37; 5 trials; 212 participants.
Four trials reported data for change in body weight that could
be meta-analysed (Analysis 2.3). Meta-analysis demonstrated no
difference in body weight in the intervention groups compared
with controls at the final follow-up: MD 1.59 kg (95% CI -4.58
to 7.77); P = 0.61; 4 trials; 106 participants.
We were unable to include seven trials in the BMI/BMI z score
meta-analyses. Bathrellou 2010 and Epstein 2015 only presented
BMI values at baseline but did not present them at follow-up (only
gave percent overweight). Epstein 1985a measured BMI but did
not provide any data (only provided data for weight and percent
overweight). Duffy 1993 and Epstein 1985b did not measure or
present BMI values. Duggins 2010 presented mean change in BMI
at the end of the study but did not provide any SDs. Hence, we
could not use these data in the meta-analyses. At 12 months, a
mean change of +10.2 units in the treatment group versus +6.5
units in the control group was reported (no P value was given).
Schwingshandl 1999 found a change in BMI SDS of -0.53 units
in the intervention group versus -0.51 units in the control group
after the 12-week intervention. The participants were followed
up one year after baseline; however, the publication only provides
results for fat free mass at one year, no BMI results were given.
Adverse events
Intwotrials, noadverse eventsoccurredineithergroup(Woo 2004
- confirmed through author correspondence, and NCT02436330
- data given in clinical trials register). In 12 trials it was unclear
whether adverse events occurred. This included six Epstein stud-
ies (Epstein 1985a; Epstein 1985b; Epstein 1985c; Epstein 2001;
Epstein 2005; Epstein 2015) where it was unclear from the pub-
lications whether any adverse events occurred; however, after cor-
respondence with the studies’ author they highlighted that no ad-
verse events were related to study participation but it was still un-
clear which studies had adverse events and what they were.
Secondary outcomes
The additive components across the studies varied greatly, there-
fore we analysed these comparisons in a separate meta-analysis
from the usual-care and no-treatment controls for the primary
analyses (see above) and have not used these comparisons in sub-
grouping. We have narratively described the secondary outcomes,
as meta-analyses were not possible because the additive compo-
nents that were investigated varied greatly between the studies.
Health-related quality of life and self-esteem
No trials measured health-related quality of life. However,
NCT02436330 measured physical self-worth and global self-
worth using the Children and Youth Physical Self-Perception

 Profile; no substantial differences between groups were found in
changes from baseline to six months’ follow-up.
All-cause mortality
No deaths were reported in any of the trials.
Morbidity
No trials measured morbidity.
Anthropometric measures other than change in BMI
Fourteen studies reported measuring other anthropometric mea-
sures; three of the eight studies that reported percent overweight
found a significant difference in favour of the intervention group
at the longest follow-up (Epstein 1985a; Epstein 1985c; Epstein
2015).
Waist circumference was measured in two studies (Larsen 2015;
NCT02436330) but only Larsen 2015 found a difference in
favour of the intervention group at the study’s two-year endpoint
(a similar finding was also seen for waist-to-height ratio). Woo
2004 measured waist-to-hip ratio, but found no substantial dif-
ferences between groups.
Skinfold thickness was measured in Flodmark 1993 and found
differences in reduction of all three skinfold measurements (tri-
ceps, subscapular and suprailiac) in favour of the intervention.
Woo 2004 was the only study to measure body fat via DEXA -
they found no substantial differences between groups.
Behaviour change
No studies used accelerometry to measure physical activity but
NCT02436330 usedpedometerstomeasure weeklysteps-nosub-
stantial differences between groups were observed. Epstein 2005
used a three-day physical activity recall method to measure MVPA
but found no substantial differences between groups. Three stud-
ies measured physical work capacity/physical fitness using a bicycle
ergometry test and two of these studies found a treatment differ-
ence (Epstein 1985b; Flodmark 1993) while the remaining study
found no substantial difference between groups (Epstein 1985a).
NCT02436330 measured after school and Saturday screen time
but found no substantial differences between groups at six months.
NCT02436330 measured dietary intake using “The Block Alive
food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)”. An increase in carbohy-
drates was seen in the treatment group compared to the control;
however, the number of fruit servings was higher in the control
group after six months. No substantial differences were found be-
tween groups in the other dietary domains (total calorie intake,
percent fat, number of vegetable servings, sugar-sweetened bev-
erage intake). Dietary intake was also measured by two studies
(Duffy 1993; Epstein 2015) using a Traffic Light Diet question-
naire but only Epstein 2015 found a treatment effect for the re-
duction in red foods (unhealthy foods) and also fat intake, but
they did not observe a substantial difference between groups in
total calorie intake. Epstein 2005 measured dietary intake through
a habit book and found a treatment effect at six and 12 months in
alternatives to eating (activities that did not involve eating) but did
not see a substantial difference between groups in eating periods.
Two studies used the O’Neil 1979 questionnaire (Epstein 1985a;
Epstein 1985c) to assess eating behaviours but only differences in
favour of the intervention group were observed in Epstein 1985c.
Participant views
No studies measured participants’ views of the intervention
Socioeconomic effects
No trials measured socioeconomic effects.
Cluster RCTs
All cluster RCTs had a usual care or no treatment control group
except Berry 2007 which added a coping skills training element
to a family behavioural therapy intervention.
Primary outcomes
Changes in body mass index (BMI), BMI z score and weight
We meta-analysed two cluster RCTs (Berry 2007; Taveras 2015)
(Analysis 3.1) and demonstrated no substantial difference in BMI
in the intervention groups compared with controls at the final
follow-up: mean difference (MD) -0.49 kg/m2 (95% CI -1.24 to
0.27); P = 0.20; 2 trials; 629 participants. Taveras 2015 also re-
ported the BMI z score - compared with the usual care group, chil-
dren in the two intervention arms (clinical decision support and
clinical decision support plus individual family coaching) showed
a small mean change in BMI z score: -0.06 (95% CI -0.11 to -
0.02) and -0.05 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.00), respectively. No substan-
tial differences were found between the two treatment groups.
Wright 2012 presented changes in BMI and BMI z score at 12
months’ follow-up; however, there were concerns over the 95%
CIs presented which we suspected were ranges rather than CIs.
We tried to contact the study author to clarify but did not receive
a response. Therefore, we did not include this study in the meta-
analysis. The publication reports that there were between-group
differences in BMI and BMI z score, in favour of the intervention
group. We did not include Berry 2014 in the meta-analyses for
BMI/BMI z score because it was not clear from the publication
how many children were included in the follow-up analysis. The
publication reported that there were no substantial differences be-
tween groups for BMI percentile at both 12 and 18 months’ fol-
low-up.
There were no cluster trials that reported data on weight.

 Adverse events
In the four cluster trials in this review, Berry 2007, Berry 2014 and
Taveras 2015 had no adverse events in either group (confirmed
through study author correspondence). It was unclear if any ad-
verse events occurred in Wright 2012.
Secondary outcomes
Health-related quality of life and self-esteem
No trials measured health-related quality of life or self-esteem.
All-cause mortality
No deaths were reported in any of the trials.
Morbidity
No trials measured morbidity.
Anthropometric measures other than change in BMI
Berry 2007 measured body fat percentage using bioelectrical
impedance analysis (BIA) but found no substantial differences be-
tween groups at the study’s endpoint. Berry 2014 measured waist
circumference and found a treatment effect at 12 months’ follow-
up but not at 18 months. Triceps and subscapular skinfolds were
also measured and a treatment effect was found at 18 months’
follow-up.
Behaviour change
Activity was measured using pedometers (number of steps) in
Berry 2007 but no substantial differences between groups were
observed at follow-up.
Berry 2014 used the Child and Adolescent (CATCH) question-
naire tomeasure dietandphysical activitychanges, butonlydietary
knowledge was improved in the intervention group at 18 months
compared to the control. Berry 2014 also used the Child Health
behaviour survey by the Department of Health and Human Ser-
vices 2004 to measure dietary habits and only found a treatment
effect for reduced soda consumption at 18 months. Wright 2012
used the Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health Af-
ter-School Student Questionnaire (ASSQ) to assess dietary intake
and eating behaviours and found treatment effects for some out-
comes (e.g. fruit and vegetable intake, food intentions); however,
others showed no substantial differences (e.g. sweets intake, always
reading food labels).
Participants’ views
Participants’ views were measured in one cluster trial (Taveras
2015) that involved two clinical-led interventions compared
against a usual-care group; the most intensive intervention was
highly rated by parents (81.3% were satisfied) while only 46.9%
of the parents in the less intensive intervention were satisfied.
Socioeconomic effects
No trials measured socioeconomic effects.
Maintenance intervention following weight reduction
Primary outcomes
Changes in body mass index (BMI), BMI z score and weight
Two trials reported BMI z score data (de Niet 2012; Wilfley 2007)
that could be meta-analysed (Analysis 4.1) and demonstrated no
difference in BMI z score in the intervention groups compared
with controls at the final follow-up: mean difference (MD) -0.07
units (95% CI -0.19 to 0.04); P = 0.22; 2 trials; 263 participants).
There were no maintenance trials that reported data for BMI or
for body weight suitable for meta-analysis.
Adverse events
Both trials had no adverse events (de Niet 2012 confirmed through
study author correspondence, and Wilfley 2007 through informa-
tion in the publication).
Secondary outcomes
Health-related quality of life and self-esteem
de Niet 2012 used The Child Health Questionnaire-PF50 (CHQ-
PF50) to measure health-related quality of life. A treatment ef-
fect was found at three and six months’ follow-up in the physi-
cal domain but this was lost at nine months’ follow-up. de Niet
2012 also measured self-esteem using the Self-Perception Profile
for Children (SPPC)/Harter global score but found no substantial
differences between groups at nine months.
All-cause mortality
No deaths were reported in any of the trials.
Morbidity
No trials measured morbidity.
Anthropometric measures other than change in BMI
Wilfley 2007 measured percentage overweight at two years’ follow-
up but found no substantial differences between the treatment and
control groups. The BMI z score meta-analysis for maintenance
trials (Analysis 4.1) showed no substantial differences between
groups.

 The Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ) was used
to measure behaviour change in de Niet 2012. A treatment effect
was seen for external eating at three months from baseline, but
not at six or 15 months. No substantial differences were observed
in emotional eating or restrained eating.
Wilfley 2007 used a Child Dietary Self-efficacy scale and found
a treatment effect at two-year follow-up for the social facilitation
maintenance intervention group when compared against the con-
trol group; the behavioural-skills maintenance intervention group
showed a treatment effect compared with control but only at one-
year follow-up. There were no substantial differences between the
two treatment groups. Wilfley 2007 also used a Self-efficacy Scale
for Children’s Physical Activity but only found a difference in
favour of the social facilitation maintenance for ‘positive alterna-
tives to unhealthy habits’ (increasing healthy foods and decreasing
sedentary behaviour) at two years; no substantial differences were
found for barriers between treatment groups.
Participants’ views
No studies measured participants’ views of the intervention.
Socioeconomic effects
No trials measured socioeconomic effects.
Subgroup analyses
We performed a number of subgroup analyses to test the effects
of different types of comparators, the type of intervention, the
setting, risk of attrition bias, duration of post-intervention follow-
up, the involvement of parents, and mean baseline BMI z score
on outcomes of BMI, BMI-z score and weight.
We did not perform subgroup analyses on the different durations
of follow-up from baseline, combining those studies reporting
six months’ follow-up, those reporting 12 months’ follow-up and
those reporting 18 months’ follow-up or more. Neither did we
perform subgroup analyses based on the length of the interven-
tions, combining studies with a duration of intervention of six
months or less and studies with duration of intervention of greater
than six months. This would have resulted in some studies being
included in more than one subgroup for the duration of follow-up
because some studies reported follow-up at multiple time points.
Also, grouping studies according to whether they were six months
or less or greater than six months would not assess all studies imme-
diately post-intervention and would not evaluate the actual length
of active intervention for all studies. We were most interested in
the longer-term effects of weight-management interventions and
the sustainability of weight reduction. Due to the relatively large
number of included studies in this review we were able to subgroup
according to duration of post-intervention follow-up, that is, we
could assess whether follow-up after the active intervention, and
the duration of that follow-up period, impacted on BMI, BMI z
score and weight outcomes.
Type of control
We did not see any subgroup differences for change in BMI, BMI z
score and weight when comparing studies with controls described
as ’no intervention’ and studies with controls described as ’usual
care’ (Analysis 1.14; Analysis 1.15; Analysis 1.16).
Type of intervention
The majority of studies were multi-disciplinary interventions,
however, some studies were single or dual interventions. We did
not see any subgroup differences for change in BMI (Analysis
1.17), change in BMI z score (Analysis 1.18) or change in weight
(Analysis 1.19).
Risk of attrition bias
We did not see any subgroup differences when combining studies
according to high, low or unclear risk of attrition bias for change
in BMI (Analysis 1.20), change in BMI z score (Analysis 1.21) or
change in weight (Analysis 1.22).
Setting of intervention
For setting, the studies were divided into eight subgroups, school,
community, home, primary care, secondary care, university re-
search clinics, hospital inpatient and mixed settings. We did
not see any subgroup differences for change in BMI (Analysis
1.25), change in BMI z score (Analysis 1.24) or change in weight
(Analysis 1.23).
Duration of post-intervention follow-up
We put studies into subgroups based on whether they had a pe-
riod of post-intervention follow-up (defined as the period after
the active intervention and up to the final measurement) and the
duration of that period: no post-intervention follow-up (N = 15),
less than six months (N = 3), six months to less than 12 months
(N = 2) and post-intervention follow-up lasting 12 months or
longer (N = 4). We calculated the duration of no post-interven-
tion follow-up by subtracting the active intervention period from
the total duration of the study (i.e. intervention and all follow-up
duration).
For change in BMI (Analysis 1.26), combining studies by post-in-
tervention follow-up indicated a statistically significant subgroup
difference (P = 0.03), however this is not reliable because all the
CIs overlap (to a small degree, regarding the CI for studies with
post-intervention follow-up 12 months or more versus no post-
intervention follow-up). There were no subgroup differences for
BMI z score change (Analysis 1.27) or change in weight (Analysis
1.28).

 Parental involvement
We put studies into subgroups based on whether the interven-
tion involved the parent and child, whether only the child was
treated without any parental involvement and whether the parent
was specifically targeted (but the child was included in the inter-
vention). There was no subgroup difference on change in BMI
(Analysis 1.29), change in BMI z score (Analysis 1.30) or change
in weight (Analysis 1.31).
Mean baseline BMI z score
We put studies into subgroups based on whether the mean baseline
BMI z score was less than 2.67 units or 2.67 units or greater (which
equates to the 99.6th centile for severe obesity). There was no
subgroup difference on change in BMI z score (Analysis 1.32).
Sensitivity analyses
We performed sensitivity analyses restricting the main BMI, BMI
z score and weight meta-analyses (Analysis 1.1; Analysis 1.2;
Analysis 1.3) to those studies that provided change score data
(along with an SD, SE and 95% CI). Hence, we excluded studies
where the mean change score SD was not provided but was im-
puted following the guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Sys-
tematic Reviews of Interventions (Section 16.1.3.2 Imputing stan-
dard deviations for changes from baseline; Higgins 2011c) and
assumed a correlation of 0.5 between baseline and follow-up mea-
sures as suggested by Follmann 1992. All three sensitivity analyses
were very similar to the original analyses; which showed that our
original analyses were robust (see Table 2).
Assessment of reporting bias
We generated funnel plots for the primary outcomes of BMI, BMI
z score and weight, as these analyses included the highest number
of studies on which to assess publication bias. Inspection of the
funnel plots for BMI and weight (but not BMI z score) showed an
uneven distribution of studies and suggested a possibility of small
study bias (data not shown).

Summary of main results
We included 70 trials in this review, with 55 comparing a be-
haviour-changing intervention with no treatment or usual-care
control and 15 testing an additional component added to a be-
haviour-changing intervention. The vast majority of trials were
multicomponent (N = 64) and individual trial sample sizes ranged
from 16 to 686 participants. Total duration of trials ranged from
six months to three years; duration of active intervention ranged
from 10 days to two years. Just over half (37) of the trials had a
period of post-intervention follow-up with a median duration of
10 months.
A total of 8461 participants were randomised to either the inter-
vention or control groups; approximately 69.5% of participants
were measured at the study’s endpoint. Primary analyses demon-
strated that behaviour-changing interventions compared to no
treatment or usual-care control reduced BMI, BMI z score and
body weight. We could pool data from 24 trials reporting BMI for
analysis, which demonstrated a reduction in BMI in favour of the
intervention (measured at the last available point of follow-up) of
-0.53 (95% CI -0.82 to -0.24); 24 trials; 2785 participants; low-
quality evidence). Thirty-seven trials reported BMI z score data
suitable for meta-analysis, which resulted in a reduction in favour
of intervention (measured at last available point of follow-up) of
-0.06 units (95% CI -0.10 to -0.02); 37 trials; 4019 participants;
low-quality evidence). Seventeen trials reported change in body
weight that could be meta-analysed, and demonstrated a reduction
in body weight in the intervention groups compared with controls
at the final follow-up: MD -1.45 kg (95% CI -1.88 to -1.02); P <
0.00001; 17 trials; 1774 participants; low-quality evidence).
We excluded from the main analysis the 15 trials that evaluated an
additional component to a behaviour-changing intervention, as
the additive elements under investigation were extremely diverse
and not comparable to the other interventions.
Thirty-five trials had no adverse events, 29 trials were unclear as
to whether adverse events occurred and six trials reported a range
of adverse events in a small percentage of participants. Thirty
one trials documented serious adverse events, although the vast
majority (N = 29) reported zero occurrence.
Six trials (718 participants) reported paediatric quality of life in-
ventory, two trials (144 participants) reported a measure of self-
esteem, two trials (168 participants) reported change in caloric in-
take and six (744 participants) reported accelerometry-measured
physical activity; however, none of these analyses demonstrated
a significant difference between intervention and control. In the
two trials reporting on minutes per day of TV viewing, a small
reduction of 6.6 minutes per day (95% CI -12.88 to -0.31), P =
0.04; 2 trials; 55 participants) was found in favour of the inter-
vention.
No trials reported on all-cause mortality, morbidity or socioeco-
nomic effects, and few trials reported on participant views; none
of which could be meta-analysed.
As the meta-analyses revealed significant heterogeneity, we con-
ducted subgroup analyses to examine the impact of type of com-
parator, type of intervention, risk of attrition bias, setting of in-
tervention, duration of post-intervention follow-up period, type
of parental involvement and mean baseline BMI z score. No sub-
stantial subgroup effects were shown for any of the subgroups on
any of the outcomes (BMI, BMI z score or weight). There was
an indication of an effect for duration of post-intervention fol-
31

 low-up for BMI only, which demonstrated that intervention ef-
fects between groups differed only immediately post intervention
(heterogeneity increased) and for post-intervention follow-up of
less than six months (heterogeneity reduced to zero), however this
hypothetical finding has to be further investigated in independent
studies. These findings align with data from the two trials (263
participants) identified in this review that specifically examined
the impact of a maintenance period following weight loss on BMI
z score and found no substantial difference between intervention
and control.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
This review contains the largest number of trials and participants,
compared to the other systematic reviews in this series (surgery;
drugs; parent-only interventions; diet, physical activity and be-
havioural interventions for young children aged 0 to 6 years, and
adolescents aged 12 to 17 years).
The bulk of the evidence was derived from multicomponent inter-
ventions that involved the parent and child. The interventions var-
ied in duration including longer-term interventions (up to three
years) and follow-up after a period of no active intervention in half
of the trials. The majority of evidence relates to trials published
from2000onwards;however, there wasnoevidence includedfrom
trials conducted in lower middle-income countries. The review
included evidence from a wide variety of settings. There was less
evidence relating to younger children (median age was 10 across
the trials) and for non-white children; however, both girls and boys
were equally represented. These limitations call into question the
transferability of the findings to cultural and geographic settings
other than upper- and upper middle-income countries . There-
fore, the results should be interpreted carefully within the con-
text of local population needs (i.e. age, sex, socioeconomic status,
ethnicity, religion, culture, disabilities/complex needs, severity of
obesity) and local political and health systems.
All participants included in this review were overweight, obese or
severely obese at baseline. Whilst any reduction in body mass in
overweight or obese children may be of benefit, the small reduction
observedinthe studiesincludedinthisreviewmaynotbe sufficient
to improve or prevent obesity-related comorbidities. Indeed there
was a lack of data reported on obesity-related comorbidities. The
authors of a recent study in England (in older school aged children
- median age 12.4 years) reported that a reduction of 0.25 BMI z
score units was required to improve adiposity and metabolic health
(Ford 2010). This is a reduction much higher than that observed
in this review.
Very few studies measured any of the review’s secondary outcomes
other than anthropometric outcomes, the results of those that did
were inconsistent and used a variety of measurement tools. Out-
come results were also inconsistent depending on the timing of
measurements within the studies. In summary, the data were too
limited and heterogeneous to enable any meaningful synthesis of
secondary outcomes for those studies that investigated adding a
component to a behaviour-changing intervention, maintenance
trials and cluster RCTs. Meta-analyses of secondary outcomes for
usual care/no treatment comparators showed no substantial dif-
ferences between groups or wide 95% CIs, or both.
Quality of the evidence
We rated over half (N = 48) of the 70 included studies as having
a low risk of selection bias based on the randomisation method
they used. We rated 49 studies as low risk of bias for allocation
concealment. However, we rated a majority of trials as high risk of
bias for blinding (for both performance and detection bias). Forty-
five studies did not blind their participants or study personnel to
study group allocation with regards to objective measures. Only
eight trials did not have a high risk of bias on at least one criterion.
GRADE assessments of the outcomes in this review led to trials
being downgraded for risk of bias, inconsistency and also impreci-
sion. This made overall interpretation of the data difficult. Over-
all the quality of included trials was low for BMI, BMI z score,
weight, adverse events and parent-reported health-related quality
of life, and very low for child-reported health-related quality of
life.
Potential biases in the review process
The review identified all relevant trials with searches from incep-
tion of databases to July 2016 and all efforts were made to include
studies published up until the start of November 2016 and to ob-
tain any additional data.
There is a potential bias in terms of the wider applicability of the
findings, with the vast majority of included studies conducted in
high-income countries, with a heavy reliance on data from the
USA. It is also unclear as to applicability of the findings in popu-
lations of different socioeconomic status and ethnicity, due to lack
of reporting of ethnicity data in the majority of trials.
The impact of the comparator group should also be considered,
given that a significant proportion of studies used a ‘usual care’
condition which varied greatly in terms of content and intensity;
there was an element of subjectivity introduced in that review
authorshadtosometimesassesswhetherthe comparatorwas’usual
care’ if not reported by the study authors as such.
We attempted to contact all study authors whenever there were
missing data or clarification was needed. The majority of studies
did not report if adverse events occurred; hence, we contacted
study authors for this information. Some study authors did not
reply and this may have introduced bias. However, we felt it was
important to contact study authors about adverse events because
reporting was so poor. Furthermore, we had concerns that some

 studies never measured or documented adverse events, so if any
did occur, they would not have been captured.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
This review is a partial update to a previous Cochrane Review: the
original review ’Interventions for treating obesity in children and
adolescents’ (Oude Luttikhuis 2009) was split into six separate
reviews, with a specific intervention and age focus.
• Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the
treatment of overweight or obesity in adolescents aged 12 to 17
years
• Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the
treatment of overweight or obesity in children from the age of 6
to 11 years
• Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the
treatment of overweight or obesity in preschool children up to
the age of 6 years (Colquitt 2016)
• Drug interventions for the treatment of obesity in children
and adolescents (Mead 2016a)
• Parent-only interventions for childhood overweight or
obesity (Loveman 2015)
• Surgery for the treatment of obesity in children and
adolescents (Ells 2015b)
This review is now a stand-alone review of all the RCT evidence
relating to the treatment of overweight or obesity in children aged
6 to 11 years. The evidence base contained in this review has in-
creased substantially; the majority of these new trials have focused
on multi-component interventions with a mix of diet, physical ac-
tivity and behaviour-change elements. However, despite the sub-
stantial increase in available evidence, the overall effects in terms
of BMI/BMI z score and weight reductions in favour of inter-
ventions remain similar to the previous Cochrane Review of in-
terventions to treat childhood obesity (Oude Luttikhuis 2009),
with continued heterogeneity in terms of comparators, interven-
tion content and delivery. The previous Cochrane Review (Oude
Luttikhuis 2009) found very similar reductions in BMI z scores,
in favour of the intervention for children under 12 years old, at 6
and 12 months’ follow-up: -0.06 (95% CI -0.12 to -0.01) and -
0.04 (95% CI -0.12 to 0.04), respectively.
When comparing the findings of this review to the other be-
haviour-changing intervention reviews in this series (preschool,
adolescent and parent-only), our findings are very similar. The
preschool review (Colquitt 2016) found slightly larger reduction
in BMI z score in favour of the intervention group than in this
review: -0.3 units (95% CI -0.4 to -0.2) for 6 to 12 months’ fol-
low-up, and -0.4 units (95% CI -0.6 to -0.2) for 12 to 18 months’
follow-up. However, very similar reductions in BMI z score were
found when comparing parent-only interventions to parent-child
interventions (-0.04 units, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.08) and parent-only
interventions with a waiting list control (-0.10, 95% CI -0.19 to -
0.01) (Loveman 2015). Therefore, the other two reviews support
the findings found in this review - small reductions in BMI and
BMI z score occur when comparing behaviour-changing interven-
tions to control groups.
The effects of behaviour-changing interventions for overweight/
obese children were assessed in another recent systematic review
and meta-analysis (Ho 2012). When comparing behaviour-chang-
ing treatments to no care or waiting list controls they saw a re-
duction of -1.00 kg/m2 (95% CI -1.91 to -0.08 ) in favour of
the intervention group for children 12 years old or less. A similar
reduction was found when they compared the treatment group to
a usual-care/minimal-intervention control group. A recent review
assessing the effects of educational interventions to treat obesity
in 6- to 12-year-old children (Sbruzzi 2013) found very similar
reductions in BMI and BMI z scores to this review: -0.86 kg/m2
(95% CI -1.59 to -0.14) and -0.06 units (95% CI -0.16 to 0.03),
respectively.
An overview of reviews for childhood obesity is underway that ex-
amines interventions for the treatment of obesity in children using
Cochrane methodology (Ells 2016 [pers comm]). This overview
will bring together all the evidence for any type of intervention
to treat childhood obesity and highlight any evidence gaps that
remain.
All types of treatment interventions should also be viewed within
the context of prevention interventions. It is interesting that the
effect size for BMI z score reduction (measured at longest follow-
up) observed in this treatment review of behaviour-changing in-
terventions (MD -0.06 units (95% CI -0.10 to -0.02); P = 0.001;
37 trials; 4019 participants; low-quality evidence) is very similar to
the BMI z score reduction (measured at first available point of fol-
low-up after 12-weeks) observed in the recently updated (Brown
2016 [pers comm]) obesity prevention review (Waters 2011) of
children aged up to 18 years (-0.05 units (95% CI -0.07 to -
0.03); P < 0.00001; 58 studies; 53,777 participants; low-quality
evidence).

Implications for practice
Multi-component behaviour-changing interventions that incor-
porate diet, physical activity and behaviour-change components
may be beneficial in achieving small, short-term reductions in
body mass index (BMI), BMI z score and weight in children aged
6 to 11 years. The evidence was low quality for BMI, BMI z score
and weight; and there was a limited number of trials reporting
low- to very low-quality evidence for health-related quality of life
including self-esteem. Although data on adverse events were not
well reported and of low quality, where provided, the evidence sug-
gests a very low occurrence of adverse events. The heterogeneity

 observed across all outcomes was not explained by subgrouping
based on the type of intervention, type of comparator, setting, risk
of bias, parental involvement or severity of obesity at baseline. The
sustainability of any observed reduction in BMI/BMI z score and
body weight is a key consideration and there is a need for longer-
term follow-up of these children. The evidence highlights a fo-
cus in paediatric obesity on initial weight reduction interventions
rather than longer term maintenance interventions. This review
demonstrates that interventions show effects at the end of the in-
tervention and up to six months post-intervention; the fact that
these intervention effects might not persist is not a failure of the
initial intervention, but due to a lack of maintenance interven-
tions. Obesity is a severe chronic relapsing disease becoming man-
ifest in an obesity-conducive environment, therefore it is unsur-
prising that short-term effects do not persist. Continued support
through obesity maintenance interventions are required to build
upon behaviour changes which increase resilience to obesity-con-
ducive environments.
Implications for research
The systematic review identified 20 ongoing trials of behaviour-
changing interventions, which will contribute data to the results
of an updated review. Further research is required of interventions
in lower income countries and in children from ethnic minority
groups. We still do not understand what the key components of
multicomponent interventions are that contribute to success, and
for which children. Study designs other than randomised con-
trolled trials may be helpful in improving our understanding.
Children aged 6 to 11 years are likely to require the support of
families (hence only five of the 70 included interventions targeted
the child and did not involve parents) which adds another layer of
complexity, particularly given that we know parents are also likely
to be suffering from excess weight; further research into the opti-
mal ways of involving parents in paediatric obesity interventions
is required. Despite this review including many more studies com-
pared with the original review (Oude Luttikhuis 2009), the effect
size on BMI z score is almost identical. Although the evidence is of
low or very low quality according to GRADE, the review authors
believe that it is unlikely that any subsequent update would dra-
matically alter the effects on BMI, BMI z score or weight. Perhaps
a change of focus is required, for example, qualitative research to
further our understanding of what works for who, when and why,
in the context of the family, in order to tailor and target future
obesity interventions. Future research could examine family-based
approaches that treat both obese parents and children simultane-
ously, similar to two studies included within this review (Berry
2007; Berry 2014).
Further research is required on the impacts of these interventions
for health-related quality of life, long term diet and activity be-
haviour change and obesity-related comorbidities. There is a need
for standardised reporting of key outcomes and moderators (e.g.
ethnicity, health-related quality of life, diet and physical activity
changes and socioeconomic status). Cost data were not considered
within the remit of this review; nine of the 70 (13%) included
studies measured costs associated with resource use or cost effec-
tiveness of the intervention (Bryant 2011; Coppins 2011; Hughes
2008; Kalavainen 2007; Lison 2012; McCallum 2007; Reinehr
2010; Wake 2009; Wake 2013). Nine studies reported on cost
data using a variety of different reporting methods. Whilst Wake
2013 planned a full economic evaluation, this was not conducted,
as the programme did not prove to be effective, and Lison 2012
simply reported that the hospital-based intervention was more ex-
pensive when compared to the home-based approach. Kalavainen
2007 reported a cost per 0.1 decrease in BMI SDS of EUR 168
for the intervention group, whilst Reinehr 2010 reported a cost
per family of EUR 652. The remaining five studies provided an
estimated cost of the intervention per person ranging from GBP
108 (Hughes 2008), GBP 403 (Coppins 2011), GBP 858 (Bryant
2011), AUD873(McCallum 2007)andAUD1317(Wake 2009).
However, not all of these studies conducted formal cost-effective-
ness analyses. As these outcomes are vitally important for practice
implications and decision-makers, it is import that these outcomes
are systematically reviewed.
A UK trackingstudy(Mead 2016b)usingdatafromthe Millenium
cohort showed that overweight and obese children at 4/5 years
old are very likely to remain overweight and obese at 11/12 years
old. In addition, obese deprived boys at age 4/5 were more likely
to remain obese at age 11/12 compared with non-deprived obese
boys (trend not seen in girls). Therefore, interventions targeted at
children aged 6 to 11 years are capturing an important timeframe,
however there is a complete lack of data reporting on the potential
moderating effect of socioeconomic status on obesity.
Further work is required to determine the most appropriate and
effective forms of post intervention maintenance, including the
level of intensity and different modes of maintenance intervention,
in order to ensure intervention benefits are sustained over the
longer term.

Quote from publication: “The subjects
were stratified by pubertal development (4
categories) and BMI z score (2 categories:
≤2.1 SD or >2.1 SD). Within these 8
strata, randomly permuted block sizes were
used to generate the randomized allocation
sequence. Subjects were randomly assigned
to one of 3 diet groups-LC (n = 35), RGL

their diet assignment at the initial interven-

Quote from publication:· “We used a
stratified block randomization scheme to
assign practices to one of the 3 study arms.
Strata were based on the volume of chil-
dren aged 6.0 to 12.9 with a BMI 95th per-
centile seen for well-child visits at each site
from April 2010 through March 2011. A
biostatistician (KPK) blinded to the names
of the practices ordered them on this char-
acteristic, then introduced a false practice
at a random spot within the order to make
the number of ”practices“ evenly divisible
by 3. Strata consisted of consecutive groups
of three practices from this ordered list. He
then used a pseudo-random number gen-
erator in SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary NC)
to assign one practice from each strata to
each of the arms, with the exception that
the false practice was deterministically as-
signed to the usual care arm. This resulted
in 5 practices in each of the intervention
arms and 4 in the usual care arm.”

Exclusion criteria:
• obesity-related complications that would interfere with participant
• underlying causes of obesity
• severe psychological problems
• participation in an obesity treatment programme in the year prior to enrolment
Interventions
Intervention: the intervention consists of: (1) BMI screening, (2) Next Steps brief counselling materials for
the healthcare provider, (3) a 3-month intensive Mind Exercise Nutrition Do It! and Coordinated Approach
To Child Health (MEND/CATCH) phase, which included the Mind Exercise Nutrition Do it! with
adapted CATCH activities, and (5) a 9-month transition MEND/CATCH Transition phase of monthly
reinforcement sessions for parents and children, and twice-weekly Young Men’s Christian Association
(YMCA) sports for children. Community Health Workers (CHWs) serve as programme liaisons and assist
in delivering all intervention group sessions as well as tracking families
Control: (active comparator - additional component to a behaviour-changing intervention and usual care)
Next Steps brief clinical intervention which is a 12-month clinic-based programme conducted at 12 partner
healthcare clinics and entailed (1) EHR changes to support childhood obesity clinical visits; (2) BMI
screening, (3) Next Steps brief counselling materials for the healthcare provider, and (4) Next Steps self-
paced booklet for parents and children to work on nutrition and physical activity targets in a self-directed
manner. Families were encouraged to seek repeated clinical visits to address child obesity
Outcomes
Primary outcome: change in obesity prevalence at baseline, 3 and 12 months

Texas Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration (TX CORD) Project
Stated purpose of study
“Aim 1: To implement and evaluate the efficacy of a systems approach to child obesity on reducing BMI
(expressed as %95th percentile) by embedding a 12-month family-based secondary prevention program
within a community primary prevention program. The secondary prevention weight management program
will target overweight/obese children and their families in the primary prevention catchment areas in Austin
and Houston. Overweight/obese children (total N = 576), aged 2-12 years, will be randomly assigned to
either the 12-month secondary prevention program (experimental) or the community primary prevention
program alone (control), in equal age subgroups (2-5, 6-8, and 9-12 years). Analyses will be conducted by
age group, and outcomes will include BMI as expressed as %95th percentile), obesity-related behaviors,
quality of life, and program use indicators
Aim 2: To quantify the incremental cost-effectiveness of the 12-month family-based secondary prevention
program relative to primary prevention alone for child obesity. Activity Based Costing methods will be
used to quantify the incremental cost of delivering the secondary prevention program relative to optimized
healthcare. These costs will then be combined with the effectiveness data to quantify the incremental cost-
effectiveness of the community-based intervention.”

Environmental strategies & behavior change to reduce overeating in obese children
Stated purpose of study
“There is a need for effective weight control methods for obese children. Environmental strategies such as
reducing the size of dishware and serving utensils, storing food out of view and reducing food consumption
while watching television may reduce food intake without requiring conscious, cognitive self-control. The
investigators propose to test these methods when added to a current state-of-the-art behavioral program.”

Implementing Prevention Plus for childhood overweight and obesity in food secure and insecure families
Methods
Type of study: interventional
Allocation: randomised
Intervention model: parallel
Masking: single-blind (outcome assessor)
Primary purpose: treatment
Participants
Condition: obesity
Enrollment: target 120
Inclusion criteria:
• 4-10 years
• boys and girls
• patients at designated clinics
• caregiver willing to participate
Exclusion criteria:
• caregiver not able to speak English
Interventions
Intervention: “PP+: Following baseline assessment, children will continue to receive standard care at CHS
and the monthly newsletter. Additionally, each family will be provided with a scale; wall growth chart to
measure height; a BMI wheel to calculate BMI; a BMI-for-age growth chart; a binder for intervention
materials; a self-monitoring diary to record child’s monthly height, weight, BMI and BMI percentile; and
picture-based diaries to monitor daily energy balance behaviours. Family materials provided at each session
will outline a process to measure growth and include information about how children grow, as well as cover
behavioral parenting strategies to assist with changing child behavior for energy balance behaviors
Families will meet in person with a BHC at the CHS clinic in which they receive care for 30 minutes during
months 1, 3, and 5. In these sessions, child height and weight will be taken, and BMI will be plotted on the
BMI-for-age growth chart. Families will receive feedback about growth and the weight status of their child.
Additionally, the session materials will be reviewed and behavioral parenting strategies will be encouraged
to aid with changing two dietary and two leisure-time activity (energy balance) behaviors of the child. As is
traditional in a family-based approach, the caretaker will also change the same energy balance behaviors as
the child, as adult caretakers can then model healthy behaviors for the child, assisting the child in learning
the new weight-related behaviors.13 Thus, both the caretaker and child will be encouraged to change and
self-monitor energy balance behaviors with the use of the picture-based diaries
During months 2, 4, and 6, BHCs will complete a 20-minute phone call with the caretaker. Caretakers
will be asked to measure the height and weight of their child, calculate BMI and plot it on the BMI-for-
age growth chart prior to the call. During the call, the BHC will provide feedback on the changes in child
growth since the previous contact. Additionally, the BHC will discuss the family’s progress on achieving
child and caretaker energy balance behavior goals and implementation of behavioral parenting strategies
The child’s energy balance behavioral goals will be to consume < 3 sugar-sweetened beverage (e.g., regular
carbonated soft drinks, sports drinks, lemonades, ice teas, flavoured milk, juice drinks < 100% juice, and
punches) servings /wk, ≥1 ½ cups/day of whole vegetables and ≥ 1 cup/day of whole fruit, engage in ≥ 60
minutes/day of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity, and reduce TV viewing to < 2 hours/day.
The caretaker’s energy balance behavioral goals will be to consume < 3 sugar-sweetened beverage servings/
wk, ≥ 2 ½ cups/day of whole vegetables and ≥ 1 ½ cups/day of whole fruit, engage in ≥ 150 minutes
of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity per week, and reduce TV viewing to < 10 hours/wk.
To increase self-efficacy, the goals will be incrementally increased, with families implementing the full
programme goals at month four. Additionally, children and caretakers will be asked to achieve at least three
of the five goals each day (child) or week (adult caretaker).”

Control: “PP: This condition will be identical to PP+ except that caretakers will not receive any energy
balance behavior goals. Additionally, the caretaker will not self-monitor energy balance behaviors. The
focus will be on all other behavioral parenting strategies to assist the child with making changes in the
targeted behaviors (i.e., stimulus control, positive reinforcement, and assisting child in self-monitoring
energy-balance behaviors).”
NB both conditions will be given to high and low household food security

BMI z score: “A BMI z score or standard deviation score indicates how many units (of the standard deviation) a child’s BMI is above or
below the average BMI value for their age group and sex. For instance, a z score of 1.5 indicates that a child is 1.5 standard deviations
above the average value, and a z score of -1.5 indicates a child is 1.5 standard deviations below the average value” (NOO NHS 2011)

aQuestions on risk of bias are answered in relation to the majority of the aggregated evidence in the meta-analysis rather than to
individual trials.
bDepends on the context of the systematic review area.
cQuestions on inconsistency are primarily based on visual assessment of forest plots and the statistical quantification of heterogeneity
based on I² (Higgins 2002).
dWhen judging the width of the confidence interval it is recommended to use a clinical decision threshold to assess whether the
imprecision is clinically meaningful.
eQuestions address comprehensiveness of the search strategy, industry influence, funnel plot asymmetry and discrepancies between
published and unpublished trials

is 1.5 standard deviations above the average value, and a z score of -1.5 indicates a child is 1.5 standard deviations below the average

2 March 2017
New search has been performed
This is an update of the former Cochrane Review ’Inter-
ventions for treating obesity in children and adolescents.’
2 March 2017
New citation required and conclusions have changed
Given the rapid growth in the treatment of child and ado-
lescent obesity, we have split the original review (’Interven-
tions for treating obesity in children and adolescents’) into
six separate reviews, with a specific intervention and age fo-
cus
• Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions
for the treatment of overweight or obesity in adolescents
aged 12 to 17 years
• Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions
for the treatment of overweight or obese children from the
age of 6 to 11 years
• Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions

Description
11 October 2008
New citation required and conclusions have changed
This review concludes that combined behavioural
lifestyle interventions compared to standard care or self-
help can produce a significant and clinically meaningful
reduction in overweight in children and adolescents
The search was updated to May 2008. Some amend-
ments were made to update the search strategies. No
changes have been made to other aspects of the method-
ology. Forty-six new studies have been included. These
included information on drug interventions for treating
obesity in adolescents. The added evidence suggests that
lifestyle interventions appear to have positive effects in
the treatment of child and adolescent obesity. Further-
more, orlistat and sibutramine were found to have bene-
ficial effects on adiposity in obese adolescents. However,
a range of adverse effects was noted

Given the rapid growth in the treatment of child and adolescent obesity, we have split the original review (’Interventions for treating
obesity in children and adolescents’) into six separate reviews, with a specific intervention and age focus:
• Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in adolescents aged 12 to 17
years.
• Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in children from the age of 6 to
11 years.
• Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in preschool children up to the
age of 6 years.
• Drug interventions for the treatment of obesity in children and adolescents.
• Parent-only interventions for childhood overweight or obesity.
• Surgery for the treatment of obesity in children and adolescents.
