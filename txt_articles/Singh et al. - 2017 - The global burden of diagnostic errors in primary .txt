errors in primary care

ABSTRACT
Diagnosis is one of the most important tasks
performed by primary care physicians. The World
Health Organization (WHO) recently prioritized
patient safety areas in primary care, and included
diagnostic errors as a high-priority problem. In
addition, a recent report from the Institute of
Medicine in the USA, ‘Improving Diagnosis in
Health Care’, concluded that most people will
likely experience a diagnostic error in their
lifetime. In this narrative review, we discuss the
global significance, burden and contributory
factors related to diagnostic errors in primary
care. We synthesize available literature to discuss
the types of presenting symptoms and conditions
most commonly affected. We then summarize
interventions based on available data and
suggest next steps to reduce the global burden
of diagnostic errors. Research suggests that we
are unlikely to find a ‘magic bullet’ and confirms
the need for a multifaceted approach to
understand and address the many systems and
cognitive issues involved in diagnostic error.
Because errors involve many common conditions
and are prevalent across all countries, the WHO’s
leadership at a global level will be instrumental
to address the problem. Based on our review, we
recommend that the WHO consider bringing
together primary care leaders, practicing frontline
clinicians, safety experts, policymakers, the health
IT community, medical education and
accreditation organizations, researchers from
multiple disciplines, patient advocates, and
funding bodies among others, to address the
many common challenges and opportunities to
reduce diagnostic error. This could lead to
prioritization of practice changes needed to
improve primary care as well as setting research
priorities for intervention development to reduce
diagnostic error.
INTRODUCTION
Diagnosis is one of the most important
tasks performed by primary care physi-
cians
(PCPs).
The
W
orld
Health
Organization (WHO) recently prioritised
safety areas in primary care and recog-
nised the importance of errors in diagno-
sis.1
Recognising
the
paucity
of
literature,2–4 WHO set up a Safer Primary
Care Expert W
orking Group to compile
key lessons and topics for further research.
This initiative led to the development of
the
2016
T
echnical
Series
on
Safer
Primary Care, a series of 9 monographs to
promote good practices and to implement
systems changes to improve safety
. This
narrative review informed the develop-
ment of the monograph focused on diag-
nostic errors, expected to be released by
WHO in late 2016.
For
multiple
reasons,
diagnosis
in
primary care (ie, first-contact, accessible,
continued, comprehensive and coordi-
nated care)5 represents a high-risk area
for
errors.
PCPs
typically
face
high
patient volumes and make decisions amid
uncertainty.6 Undifferentiated presenting
features
are
the
norm
for
diseases
common in primary care, which tend to
be benign and self-limiting, as well as
uncommon diseases, which tend to be
serious and life threatening. Diagnosis
typically unfolds over time and across
several episodes of care.7 8 PCPs need to
carefully
balance
the
risk
of
missing
serious illness with the wise use of often
scarce and costly referral and testing
resources. Thus, diagnostic errors leading
to patient harm from wrong or delayed
testing or treatment have emerged as a
global safety priority.9
Defining diagnostic errors
A
diagnostic
error
occurs
when
a
patient’s diagnosis is missed altogether,
inappropriately delayed and/or wrong, as
judged by the eventual appreciation of
definitive information10 but these cat-
egories of missed, delayed and wrong

 overlap extensively. For example, the following scen-
arios could involve an error in colorectal cancer diag-
nosis. The diagnoses can be considered ‘missed’
(cancer missed at three different primary care visits
despite alarming symptoms), ‘wrong’ (patient told
they have haemorrhoids at these visits but actually
have cancer) or ‘delayed’ (patient had an abnormal
laboratory test result, such as iron deficiency anaemia,
suggestive of cancer but no one reviewed the results
or notified the patient). But it is often hard to distin-
guish between the three; for example, in both missed
and wrong scenarios, diagnosis was also delayed.
Thus, these concepts have to be applied in concert to
gain situational understanding. The evolution of diag-
noses over time often makes it challenging to pinpoint
a diagnostic error and operationalise diagnostic error
definitions and measurements. The diagnostic process
can also extend across multiple providers and in dif-
ferent locations. Moreover, there are no clear guide-
lines
for
‘timely’
diagnosis
for
majority
of
conditions.11
Recent work has framed the diagnostic process
along five process dimensions all of which must be
considered in understanding diagnostic error.12 These
dimensions include (1) the patient-provider encounter
(history, exam, ordering tests/referrals based on appro-
priate assessment); (2) performance and interpretation
of diagnostic tests; (3) follow-up and tracking of diag-
nostic information (such as abnormal tests) over time;
(4) subspecialty and referral-related communication
and coordination issues; and (5) patient behaviours,
adherence and engagement. All five process dimen-
sions are vulnerable to breakdowns in primary care,
and sometimes more than one dimension is involved
in an error.13–16
A
recent
Institute
of
Medicine
(IOM)
report
‘Improving Diagnosis in Health Care’ defines a diag-
nostic error as a “failure to establish an accurate and
timely explanation of the patient’s health problem or
communicate
that
explanation
to
the
patient.”14
Other formal definitions of diagnostic error have also
been previously proposed.10 17 18 However, in this
paper, we contextualise errors as missed opportunities
that could be used to promote learning and improve-
ment versus assigning blame or responsibility to a
single clinician.18 The concept of missed opportunities
also implies that something different could be done to
prevent the error.
Three criteria should be considered when defining
preventable diagnostic errors.12 19–22 First, an error
should only be designated when case analysis reveals
evidence of a missed opportunity to make a correct
or timely diagnosis, that is, something different could
have
been
done
to
make
the
correct
diagnosis
earlier.18 Such missed opportunities may result from
individual cognitive or system-related factors, or more
commonly interplay of both, or infrequently from
more blatant factors such as lapses in accountability.
Second, the missed opportunity is framed within the
context of an ‘evolving’ diagnostic process such that
error determination depends on the temporal or
sequential context of events. This would imply that
there is evidence of omission (failure to do the right
thing) or commission (doing something wrong) at the
particular point in time at which the ‘error’ occurred.
Third, the opportunity could be missed by the pro-
vider, care team, system and/or patient.
A preventable error or delay in diagnosis may occur
due to factors outside a single clinician’s immediate
control.3 Studies of diagnostic errors often involve
some degree of hindsight bias—a type of bias in
judgement about a diagnosis coloured by retrospective
knowledge where earlier warning symptoms and signs
are later found to be either overlooked or not consid-
ered seriously yet were less obvious when at the time
of the actual encounter.23 Not all delayed/wrong diag-
noses are accompanied by evidence of missed oppor-
tunities (areas C and D in conceptual model, figure 1)
and not all missed opportunities are harmful (area A).
Although the goal is to focus on preventable diagnos-
tic harm (area B), this will require learning from all
types of diagnostic error.

 EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DIAGNOSTIC ERRORS
A recent study estimated that about 5% of US adult
patients
experience
diagnostic
errors
(defined
as
missed opportunities to make a correct or timely diag-
nosis or area A in Figure 1) in outpatient settings
every year.24 Over half of these included the possibil-
ity of harm (area B). This was likely an underestimate,
and it is unclear whether this rate would be similar in
primary care in other countries, where data are gener-
ally lacking. Current US estimates are based on studies
from integrated health systems using electronic health
records
that
facilitate
access
to
diagnostic
data.
A cross-sectional study of 12 primary care clinics in
Malaysia reported a prevalence of errors of 3.6% (95%
CI 2.2 to 5.0).25 While not representative of preva-
lence, in large studies of outpatient malpractice claims,
diagnostic errors emerge as the most common cat-
egory.26 27 Additional literature demonstrates evidence
of diagnostic errors in primary care.28 29 The frequency
of
diagnostic
error
in
paediatrics
is
unknown.
However, a survey of US paediatricians found that
more than half reported making a diagnostic error at
least once or twice a month, and that they made
harmful errors at least once or twice a year.30 Based on
the
available
data,
the
IOM
report
‘Improving
Diagnosis in Health Care’ concluded that most people
will likely have a diagnostic error in their lifetime.14
Diagnostic errors often reflect healthcare system
complexities and vulnerabilities. In low-and-middle-
income countries (LMICs; gross national income per
capita below US$12 736),31 32 diagnosis poses even
greater challenges as the process is further complicated
by limited
access to care and diagnostic testing
resources, a paucity of qualified primary care providers
and sometimes of specialists, and pre-electronic record-
keeping systems. These factors likely suggest a higher
rate of diagnostic errors in such settings compared with
high-resource settings, though evidence for this is
scarce (table 1).33 34 While access to primary care or
specialists and limited availability of health profes-
sionals and diagnostic tests might lead to underdiagno-
sis in LMICs, high-resource settings might also be more
prone to overdiagnosis because sophisticated imaging
and laboratory testing, and subspecialty consultation,
are all more accessible and there is greater concern
about malpractice liability if a diagnosis is missed.
T
ypically, there are multiple ‘root causes’ in each
error case. These include both cognitive errors such as
failing to synthesise the available evidence correctly or
failure to use the physical exam or test data ap-
propriately
.
System
flaws
such
as
problems
with
communication or coordinating care, problems with the
availability of medical record data and insufficient access
to specialists are also contributory factors.10 12 35–38
A survey of 600 US PCPs identified typical concerns,
such as settling too rapidly on a diagnosis, failing to
consider an appropriately broad differential diagnosis
or failing to order appropriate tests or consultations.39
HIGH-RISK SITUATIONS
Studies
on
the
relative
frequency
of
conditions
involved are largely from high-income
countries.
Table 1
Factors that predispose to diagnostic errors in primary care settings
Factors
Ideal circumstances
Problems contributing to error
Access to high-quality
primary care
Universal access without significant geographic, financial barriers
Limited access due to lack of money, remoteness, illiteracy,
travel constraints or limited number of healthcare facilities
Availability of
healthcare professionals
Sufficient range and number of healthcare professionals who
contribute to the primary care team
Lack of sufficient healthcare professionals perhaps due to
lack of training, outward migration or poor employment
situation
Access to specialists
Specialists immediately available in person (or remotely through
telemedicine) for expert assessment
Specialty expertise may not exist, or may be limited in
number or quality
Diagnostic tests
Full range of appropriate diagnostic modalities (eg, imaging,
laboratory tests) available when needed/appropriate
Diagnostic tests limited in scope, availability or quality as
well as failure to interpret tests correctly
Communication
Patients and providers communicate efficiently; consultation and
test results exchanged reliably and in timely fashion
Little or no sharing of medical information
Care coordination
Coordinated care facilitates available; accurate and efficient
evaluation
Consultations are delayed; test results are lost, lack of
health records to document care
Follow-up
Diagnosis enhanced by being able to follow symptom evolution;
diagnostic errors are detected and errors ameliorated
Limited follow-up and discontinuities degrade the ability for
diagnostic impressions to evolve
Affordability of care
All needed care is affordable and/or covered by insurance
Care unaffordable, or compromises other basic needs such
as food or housing
Training of healthcare
professionals
Physicians, nurses and all professional staff are well trained.
Certification and licensure requirements ensure competency
Training is sub-optimal. Certification and licensure
requirements are deficient
Availability of health
informatics resources
Mature health informatics resources exist to support clinical care
and decision-making
Health informatics resources including internet access not
available especially in remote areas. Unaffordable
subscription or download fees for medical information
Culture
Culture of safety exists; climate where clinicians not afraid to
share and learn from mistakes. Patient-empowerment promoted,
patients are partners in care
Traditional cultures often punitive, which discourages
sharing and inhibits learning. Patients more passive care

 Reviews of diagnostic errors encountered in ambula-
tory care settings suggest that diagnostic errors may
derive from routine as well as infrequent/rare condi-
tions. Some of the conditions described in a systematic
review included malignancies, myocardial infarction,
meningitis,
dementia,
iron
deficiency
anaemia,
asthma, tremor in the elderly and HIV
.6 The observa-
tional study of 190 cases of diagnostic errors12
described earlier found that the most commonly
encountered conditions involved pneumonia (6.7%),
decompensated congestive heart failure (5.7%), acute
renal failure (5.3%), cancer (5.3%) and urinary tract
infection or pyelonephritis (4.8%).
Common diagnostic errors reported in a survey of
PCPs included cancer, pulmonary embolism and cor-
onary artery disease.39 Another survey of US internal
medicine physicians reported both outpatient and
inpatient
errors
related
to
pulmonary
embolism
(4.5%), drug reactions (4.5%), lung, colorectal and
breast cancers (3.9%, 3.3% and 3.1%, respectively),
acute coronary syndrome (3.1%) and stroke (2.6%).17
In a US study of 181 malpractice claims, cancer was
the most common diagnosis involved.37 An analysis
of 1000 negligent claims against the UK general
practitioners identified diagnostic errors most com-
monly involving infections, trauma and cancer.40
Malpractice claims, however, tend to involve diagnoses
that are more serious or most harmful if not diagnosed
correctly in a timely fashion and do not necessarily rep-
resent error frequency. Nevertheless, infections, cardio-
vascular disease and cancer consistently emerge as the
most significant categories of harmful diagnostic errors
in the outpatient setting (table 2). Because children are
frequently seen in primary care and are vulnerable to
errors, we include them as a population at risk.
INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE DIAGNOSTIC ERRORS
Physicians are often unaware of outcomes of their
care,
including
their
own
diagnostic
errors.
Furthermore,
both
autopsy
studies
and
vignette
reviews show that physicians’ diagnostic accuracy and
the confidence they have in that accuracy are not
always aligned.60 61 The marked decline of autopsies
in recent years and absence of effective feedback
mechanisms are factors that can lead to overconfi-
dence and lack of appropriate calibration.33 62 Beyond
raising awareness and developing effective strategies to
deal with diagnostic uncertainty, a host of interventions

Subtle premonitory symptoms at first-contact settings often missed
Delays in diagnosis prevalent in predisposing conditions, including type 2
diabetes (median delay >2 years; 7% remained undiagnosed at 7.5 years)
and hypertension46–48
Cancer
Several cancer types49–54
Alarm symptoms often poorly predictive,55 low signal-to-noise ratio. Cancer
can be in differential of many common symptoms including headache, weight
loss, bleeding, pain
Almost a third of colorectal and lung cancer diagnoses have missed
opportunities despite ‘red flags’ (abnormal faecal occult blood, microcytic
anaemia and abnormal imaging)19 20
Referral of patients with suspected cancer for confirmatory testing challenging
due to poor access or cost
Challenges of overdiagnosis emerge when incidental findings relentlessly
pursued
Paediatrics
Claims study56 suggests meningitis, gastroenteritis,
pneumonia, appendicitis, sepsis and malignancy
Misdiagnoses may contribute to the nearly 7 million children who die each
year, largely from preventable causes57
Meningococcal disease58
Half of children misdiagnosed at the first physician contact largely because
presenting symptoms were non-specific
Viral illnesses diagnosed as bacterial, medication
side effects, appendicitis and psychiatric disorders30
More than half of surveyed paediatricians reported making a diagnostic error
at least once or twice a month, and harmful errors at least once or twice a
year
Hypertension, problems with referrals and follow-up
of abnormal laboratory values59
Primary care paediatricians who were surveyed expressed high interest in
trying to improve common sub-critical errors vs errors in less common acute
situations

 targeting both cognitive-related and systems-related
elements have been proposed, although few have been
empirically tested.63 Systems-based interventions tar-
get all five dimensions mentioned earlier, whereas
cognitive
interventions
seek
to
expand
clinicians’
knowledge
and
experience
(eg,
using
simulation),
improve clinical reasoning and decision-making skills
or provide cognitive ‘help’ (decision support and
second opinions).
While some interventions we consider here should
logically improve diagnosis,2 current evidence of their
effectiveness is limited.64 65 There is likely a need for
multifaceted or multiple interventions.66 Recognising
the lack of robust evidence of error reduction, we
identify areas where interventions could be designed
and tested (figure 2). W
e propose eight themes for
interventions, all of which are grounded in ‘the Safer
Dx framework’ to measure and reduce diagnostic
error.13
The
framework
follows
Donabedian’s
Structure-Process-Outcome model where the struc-
tural component is the ‘sociotechnical work system’
composed of various dimensions including people,
technologies (particularly health information tech-
nologies), organisational policies and practices and
external rules and regulations. Because errors arise
from interactions among the various dimensions of
the sociotechnical healthcare system, multiple compo-
nents need to be simultaneously addressed by inter-
ventions. The ‘process’ aspects of the Safer Dx
framework are defined by the five process dimensions
described earlier in the Introduction. The ‘outcome’ is
safe and efficient diagnosis (correct and timely, as
opposed to missed, delayed, wrong) as well as long-
term outcomes (eg, value, patient outcomes) related
to healthcare delivery.
Improving diagnostic reasoning
Studies of PCPs who recounted diagnostic errors high-
light
failures
in
all
stages
of
the
diagnostic
process.6 17 67–69 Several experimental studies have
highlighted
reasoning biases, in relation to both
hypothesis generation and information interpretation

 in PCPs. Certain aspects of diagnostic reasoning67
might be more important, more common or more
amenable to interventions. Interventions that could
potentially improve clinical reasoning include advice
to practice reflectively,70–72 use of tools such as mne-
monics
and
checklists,73
and
web-based
decision
support products that assist with differential diagno-
sis.74–76 ‘Debiasing’ has been proposed as an approach
to eliminate subconscious biases that contribute to
error.77 78 While many find the idea of focusing on
cognitive biases and heuristics to improve clinical rea-
soning appealing, physicians find it difficult to charac-
terise specific biases with any reliability and identify
twice as many biases when outcome implies incorrect
versus correct diagnosis.79 80 Knowledge is still key to
diagnostic
accuracy
and
efforts
to
promote
it
essential.81
Improving reliability of diagnosis requires reforming
training and medical education for PCPs and includ-
ing concepts related to the ‘basic science’ of diagnostic
error.82 PCPs would also benefit from working in
blame-free
and
improvement-focused
systems that
focus on feedback and error analysis as tools to
improve performance. They need an environment that
transforms errors into learning opportunities.
Encouraging government policies that support primary care
Robust government policies focusing on strengthening
primary care systems and making it safe and effective
while seem logical83 84 are often not well implemen-
ted. Specific strategies, some of which are more chal-
lenging for LMICs,85 include enhancing access to care
and appropriate expertise, ensuring the competency
of PCPs and primary care teams,86 making available
high-quality
diagnostic
testing
services
(radiology/
laboratory), providing a suitable work environment
with safe and effective health information technology
(IT) and improving access to reference information
resources.87
In areas where access to primary care is limited,
non-physician healthcare workers provide primary
care, and in some cases have made considerable
impact on health indicators,88 often using simple clin-
ical
algorithms
such
as
the
WHO’s
Integrated
Management of Child Illness.89 However, adequate
access to trained PCPs and specialists needs to be
ensured for more challenging cases or when specia-
lised diagnostic procedures are required. Short-term
policies
should
prioritise
conditions that
can
be
improved with relatively minor investments, such as
cancer or infection diagnoses or improved follow-up
of patients seen for emergency care.
Improving information technology
Assuming internet access is available, an attractive
option for improving access to appropriate expertise
is the use of new technology that enables remote con-
sultation and diagnosis. Remote reading of radiology
imaging was a pioneering area,50 and the applications
of remote diagnosis have expanded to include cardi-
ology, ophthalmology, pathology, dermatology and
even mental health. These resources enhance access to
subspecialty expertise, often in real-time and can be
particularly valuable for remote or dispersed clinical
settings. Moreover, health IT can support diagnostic
reasoning90 and promote detection of errors and
follow-up
and
tracking.91
92
Deploying
health
IT-based interventions requires a coordinated plan to
provide safe and effective hardware and software that
support processes, users and workflow, as well as
organisational support.93 Health IT approaches, tools
and algorithms could be used in several steps of the
diagnostic process in order to reduce diagnostic
errors.87 These steps could include traditional steps of
data gathering and broadening differential diagnosis
but also novel ways to improve patient follow-up,94
detecting diagnostic errors via novel use of ‘trig-
gers’22
95
96 and enabling diagnostic feedback to
clinicians.97
Involving patients
Engaging
and
empowering
patients
is
another
low-cost investment with large potential to leverage
improvement.98 Patients can act as a safety net by edu-
cating them what symptoms to look for, on the
expected time course of their illness and how to
re-access care if their condition does not improve or
new symptoms emerge. In addition, patients can be
proactive
in
ensuring
diagnostic
test
results
are
reviewed. They can prompt providers to think com-
prehensively of a differential diagnosis (such as asking
‘what else do you think this could be?’), access
medical knowledge on their own through reliable web
sources and help prevent diagnostic errors by partici-
pating in follow-up and feedback.99–101 Ensuring lon-
gitudinal patient follow-up beyond the consultation is
particularly important in primary care, given the non-
specific presentation and evolution of many serious
diseases over time.102 Patient empowerment includes
dispelling misconceptions such as ‘no news is good
news’ from the doctor (which could contribute to fail-
ures in follow-up of abnormal test results) and encour-
aging them to raise their diagnostic concerns or fears
without
feeling
intimidated
by
the
physician.
However, this can be challenging in passive or pater-
nalistic cultures, requiring a cultural reacclimation of
both patients and providers. Allowing patients access
to their medical records has substantial potential to
improve diagnostic reliability.
Improving access to diagnostic tests
In addition to improving access to appropriate diag-
nostic tools for common infectious conditions such as
pneumonia and diarrhoea,103 more focus is needed
on non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which require
laboratory or imaging tests for accurate diagnosis and

 monitoring.104 A recent WHO report points to a
global cancer epidemic by 2025, which should be a
high-priority area for future interventions given high
rates of delayed cancer diagnosis and the difficulties

105 Pathology and imaging services to
support diagnostic testing are often limited in LMICs.
Although plain radiography is available in many first-
contact settings, access to more sophisticated imaging,
including ultrasound, can be limited.
In many LMICs where centralised/referral laborato-
ries are unavailable, point-of-care testing (POCT) may
offer improved access to diagnostic and monitoring
laboratory tests. A recent survey of PCPs in five coun-
tries highlighted the variation in POCT adoption and
prioritised them for further development and imple-
mentation, but we need to demonstrate their effective-
ness, including cost-effectiveness.106 In addition to
developing,
evaluating
and
implementing
cost-
effective POCT techniques for common conditions,
healthcare personnel need to be trained on how to
use them, and the testing, interpretation and reporting
processes need appropriate oversight.
Developing methods to identify and learn from
diagnostic errors
Current measures of quality of care in primary care
are not focused on diagnostic error.107–109 To rou-
tinely assess the quality of diagnostic care, we need
methods to better identify and define diagnostic
errors. Promising approaches include designing trig-
gers to identify patient records that may contain diag-
nostic errors,110 assigning ‘clinical champions’ to
encourage physician reporting and learning from
errors,111 and identifying and fixing process break-
downs in the follow-up of abnormal findings.3 96
Finding and analysing individual cases of diagnostic
error through non-punitive and non-defensive discus-
sions provide a unique opportunity to understand the
problem and explore solutions.112 To minimise hind-
sight bias that arises when events are reviewed retro-
spectively, it is helpful to play forward rather than
backward to see if a different set of appropriate
actions/judgement emerge. The goal is to understand
why the actions (or inactions) made sense at the time,
and what could be improved in the future.113 Actions
that worked well should also be highlighted.
Optimising diagnostic strategies in primary care
Research is needed to define how best to manage
uncertainty, delineating the diagnostic value and time
course of emergence of individual and combinations
of clinical features. More evidence is also needed for
the validation, best uses and impact of clinical predic-
tion rules in primary care—many of which remain
untested in this setting.114 Research on optimising
knowledge access in frontline care is needed. Many
knowledge-related
diagnostic
questions
during
practice go unanswered as busy physicians move on to
the next patient.113 For many reasons, diagnostic deci-
sion support programmes are underused, with physi-
cians mainly citing lack of time and concerns about
their efficiency and utility.115
Providing systematic feedback to clinicians about their
diagnoses
In addition to learning from their own (and others’)
errors, physicians need to continuously refine and
recalibrate their diagnostic skills. Improving feedback
to PCPs is consistent with good engineering princi-
ples, but is generally minimal or absent in primary
care.62 One fertile area for investigation is the poten-
tial impact of feedback on competency in diagnostic
reasoning62 and what roles patients could play here.
Research is also needed to identify the most practical
and effective methods of providing feedback to PCPs,
and how to implement systems that encourage practi-
tioners and systems to learn from diagnostic errors
(and
diagnostic
successes).
One
model
is
the
Confidential Enquiry approach used in several coun-
tries,116 117 which can explore reasons for underlying
catastrophic diagnostic errors and help identify prior-
ity actions. This approach uses expert panels and local
clinicians to perform detailed case reviews of a series
of patients who suffered poor outcomes (usual fatali-
ties) in a non-judgemental multiperspective process.
NEXT STEPS FOR POLICY, PRACTICE AND SCIENCE
While there are plenty of intervention opportunities
discussed above, most work in this area is retrospec-
tive and conducted in high-income settings and might
not represent multiple types of primary care settings
globally. Much more robust data are needed from
LMICs. Rigorous research is needed to establish the
incidence and epidemiology of diagnostic error, to
understand the role of contributory factors and to
evaluate
potential
cognitive
and/or
system-related
interventions.118 Evidence suggests that there is no
single ‘magic bullet’ intervention for diagnostic error,
and solutions need to be rigorously evaluated for ben-
efits and unintended consequences.66 Moreover, we
need research to define and evaluate the quality of
diagnostic performance. Funding is required for all of
this research.
The IOM
recently also made
several concrete
recommendations to reduce diagnostic error, focusing
on individual clinicians and also on patients, diagnos-
tic services such as laboratory, pathology and radi-
ology, and healthcare delivery systems.14 Many of
these recommendations are applicable globally, such
as better teamwork among all parties involved in diag-
nosis, adequate time and reimbursement for ‘cogni-
tive’ work of PCPs, health IT that supports diagnosis,
engaging patients, learning from errors and research
funding climate conducive to accelerating our under-
standing of both problems and solutions. However,

 most will take sustained action and what is needed now
are steps to outline a multifaceted approach that takes
into account the local context where solutions are to
be implemented.119 Based on the review, we suggest
that the WHO consider bringing together primary care
leaders, practicing frontline clinicians, safety experts,
policymakers, health IT community, medical education
and accreditation organisations, researchers from mul-
tiple disciplines, patient advocates and funding bodies
among others, to address the many common challenges
and opportunities to reduce diagnostic error.
CONCLUSIONS
Diagnostic errors are relatively frequent and harmful
in primary care. While much remains to be learned, it
is evident that errors involve diagnosis of common
conditions. Diagnostic errors in primary care affect all
countries, strategies to address them involve many sta-
keholders, and there is no other global agency addres-
sing
the
problem. Thus,
WHO’s leadership and
actions on a global level will be instrumental for pri-
oritisation of practice changes needed to improve
primary care as well as setting research priorities for
intervention development to reduce diagnostic error.
