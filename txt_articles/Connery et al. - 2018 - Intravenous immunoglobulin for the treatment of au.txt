Abstract
The identification of brain-targeted autoantibodies in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) raises the
possibility of autoimmune encephalopathy (AIE). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is effective for AIE and for some
children with ASD. Here, we present the largest case series of children with ASD treated with IVIG. Through an ASD
clinic, we screened 82 children for AIE, 80 of them with ASD. IVIG was recommended for 49 (60%) with 31 (38%)
receiving the treatment under our care team. The majority of parents (90%) reported some improvement with 71%
reporting improvements in two or more symptoms. In a subset of patients, Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and/or
Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) were completed before and during IVIG treatment. Statistically significant
improvement occurred in the SRS and ABC. The antidopamine D2L receptor antibody, the anti-tubulin antibody and
the ratio of the antidopamine D2L to D1 receptor antibodies were related to changes in the ABC. The Cunningham
Panel predicted SRS, ABC, parent-based treatment responses with good accuracy. Adverse effects were common (62%)
but mostly limited to the infusion period. Only two (6%) patients discontinued IVIG because of adverse effects. Overall,
our open-label case series provides support for the possibility that some children with ASD may benefit from IVIG.
Given that adverse effects are not uncommon, IVIG treatment needs to be considered cautiously. We identified
immune biomarkers in select IVIG responders but larger cohorts are needed to study immune biomarkers in more
detail. Our small open-label exploratory trial provides evidence supporting a neuroimmune subgroup in patients with
ASD.
Background
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a behaviorally
defined disorder, which now affects ~ 2% of children in
the United States1. Although the standard-of-care for
ASD is behavioral therapy, such therapy requires full-time
engagement with one or several therapists for many years.
In many cases, outcomes are suboptimal and/or incom-
plete2. Thus, medical therapies that can augment beha-
vioral therapy are urgently needed.
Recent studies suggest that ASD is associated with a
variety of physiological abnormalities including immune
system dysfunction3. For example, a maternal immune
response induced during gestation results in ASD-like
behavior in offspring in the maternal immune activation
(MIA) rodent4,5 and replacing the immune system using
bone marrow transplant corrected many symptoms in a
mouse model of Rett syndrome, a syndrome closely
aligned with ASD6. In individuals with ASD, inflammatory
cytokines are elevated in the blood7 and brain8 and
microglia are active in the brain8. Children with ASD have
autoantibodies to brain tissue such as myelin basic pro-
tein, serotonin receptors, brain endothelium, cerebellar
tissue, and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) as well as

 to non-brain tissue such as the folate receptor alpha
(FRα)9 and mitochondria3. Children with autoantibodies
are reported to have a more severe form of ASD10–15. The
role of autoantibodies during gestation is exemplified by
maternal antibodies to fetal brain that have high specifi-
city for the development of ASD in the offspring16 with a
relatively
more
severe
phenotype17
and
brain
enlargement18.
The overlap between ASD and Pediatric Autoimmune
Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal
Infection (PANDAS) and Pediatric Acute-Onset Neu-
ropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS) has been undergoing
study by Cunningham et al. (in preparation) over the last
several years. PANDAS/PANS-associated autoantibodies
accelerate the function of the calcium calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) enzyme, a multi-
functional enzyme highly concentrated in the brain that
controls neurotransmission and neuronal excitability19
and regulates catecholamine20 and glutamate21 neuro-
transmission. Abnormalities in CaMKII function has been
linked to movement and neuropsychiatric disorders in
children22,23 and genetic abnormalities in the CaMKII
genes are linked to intellectual disability24. Furthermore,
previous studies have linked PANDAS/PANS-associated
biomarkers with behaviors commonly seen in ASD. For
example, high levels of either the anti-lysoganglioside
GM1 antibody or CaMKII are associated with tics and
obsessive-compulsive disorder behavior25 and high anti-
dopamine D2L to D1 antibody ratio is associated with
irritability, a frequently targeted ASD symptom26.
Brain-targeted autoantibodies in an individual with
central nervous system dysfunction point toward a diag-
nosis of an autoimmune encephalopathy (AIE). In chil-
dren and adolescents AIE is most commonly diagnosed as
non-neoplastic
limbic
encephalitis,
resulting
from
GAD27–33, voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC)29,34,
or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor34–38 auto-
antibodies or without autoantibodies28–30,34,39. Seizure is
the most common presenting symptom but children
commonly also manifest motor, cognitive, behavioral,
and/or
psychiatric
symptoms
including
aphasia35,
declining academic functioning27, depression29, anxiety29,
amnesia29,34,35, learning problems29, loss of social skills38,
hallucinations34, agitation34,39, mood disorder34, beha-
vioral changes30,35,39, decreased appetite36, irritability36,
dysautonomia30,34,39, movement disorder35, peripheral
neuropathy32,
dystonia33,
and
insomnia36,39.
Both
GAD6540 and NMDA receptor autoantibodies36–38 have
been associated with ASD with the NMDA receptor
autoantibody being associated with regressive36,38 and
late-onset37 ASD.
Case series28–30,34,35 and case reports27,31–33,36,39 con-
firm that Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is useful for
AIE in children and adolescents. IVIG has been shown to
improve symptoms of ASD, including aberrant beha-
vior41, speech and social interaction42, and ASD-related
behaviors43. A small double-blind placebo-controlled
study reported significant improvements in children with
ASD receiving IVIG on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist
(ABC) compared with those receiving placebo44. Another
study demonstrated neurodevelopmental regression when
discontinuing IVIG treatment41. In contrast, smaller case
series did not find improvements in children with ASD
with IVIG treatment45,46. As IVIG has been used to treat
PANDAS/PANS
symptoms
in
a
placebo-controlled
study47, case reports48, and case series49, IVIG could be
a treatment for children with ASD with PANDAS/PANS
symptoms.
Given that children with ASD may manifest brain
autoantibodies, we screened patients in an ASD clinic
who did not respond to standard interventions for AIE.
Selected patients with possible AIE were offered IVIG as a
potential treatment. As part of our clinical protocol,
families were asked to complete specific behavioral
questionnaires, allowing the examination of the change in
behavioral ratings for patients that received IVIG. In
addition, clinical notes were analyzed to determine
symptoms improvement, adverse effect, and treatment
course. We also examined if immune biomarkers could
predict response to IVIG treatment. Lastly, we provide
several cases as illustrations of the treatment course with
IVIG. This report provides insight to the possible utility of
IVIG treatment in children with ASD as well as the
potential limitations of this treatment.
Methods
The Institutional Review Board at the University of
Arkansas for Medical Sciences (Little Rock, AR) approved
the study. Parents
of participants
provided written
informed
consent.
The
study
is
registered
as
NCT02003170 on clinicaltrials.gov.
All patients evaluated in our ASD multispecialty clinic
for AIE were included in this study. The majority of the
patients (80/82) were diagnosis with ASD, except for two
females, one who was a sibling of a male with ASD and
AIE who was treated for severe atypical learning dis-
abilities and attention deficit and one with severe tics and
behavioral dysregulation.
ASD was diagnosed based upon one of the following
criteria: (i) a gold-standard diagnostic instrument such as
the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and/or
Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised; (ii) the state of
Arkansas diagnostic standard, defined as agreement of a
physician, psychologist and speech therapist; and/or (iii)
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM) diagnosis by a physician along with standardized
validated questionnaires and diagnosis confirmation by
the Principal Investigator (R.E.F.). We have validated that

 this criteria captures an accurate diagnosis of ASD in our
previous studies by re-evaluating a portion of the parti-
cipants with the ADI-R50–53.
Table S1 provides participant characteristics. Comorbid
conditions were derived from a parent-reported medical
questionnaire and from review of medical records.
Regression (defined as loss of already obtained skills) was
defined in detail in our questionnaire. Questions regard-
ing regression included the timing, specific skills lost,
duration of the regression, trigger (if known), and whether
or not there were multiple regressions or a single
regression. This method for assessing medical comor-
bidities has been used in several of our previous studies50–
53.
Immune markers measured
The evaluation for AIE focused on detecting brain
autoantibodies as measured by several panels. Para-
neoplastic
panel
(PNP;
Mayo
Medical
Laboratories,
Rochester, MN) measures antineuronal nuclear, anti-glial
nuclear, Purkinje cytoplasmic, P/Q and N-type calcium,
and VGKC antibodies as well as GAD65, AMPA, NMDA,
and GABA-B receptor antibodies. Because GAD6540 and
NMDA receptor36–38,54 autoantibodies have been asso-
ciated with ASD, these two autoantibodies were measured
specifically in most patients. The Cunningham panel
(antidopamine D1 receptor (D1R), antidopamine D2L
receptor (D2R), anti-lysoganglioside GM1, anti-tubulin,
CaMKII; Moleculera Lab Inc, Oklahoma City, OK) was
also performed as the symptoms associated with these
autoantibodies overlap with behavioral symptoms of ASD.
In some patients, the FRα autoantibody was measured
because of its close association with ASD9,51,52,55. Some
patients also had tests performed for markers of immune
activation such as C3, C4, CH50, C-reactive protein, and
erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Using findings from these
laboratory tests along with clinical symptoms, the need for
treatment of AIE with IVIG was considered, which is the
focus of this report.
Direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Ninety-six-well microtiter plates (Greiner Bio-One,
Monroe, NC) were coated with 50 μL of antigen in
100 mM carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) and stored
up to 2 weeks at 4 °C. Antigen coating concentrations
were as follows: 10 µg/mL of purified tubulin (MP Bio-
medicals, Santa Ana, CA), 10 µg/mL of dopamine D1
receptor (D1R, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA), 10 µg/mL
dopamine D2L receptor (D2R, Perkin Elmer), and 20 µg/
mL of lysoganglioside GM1 (Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt,
Germany). Tubulin-, D1R-, and D2R-coated plates were
washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS,
pH 7.2) containing 0.1% Tween (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Waltham,
MA).
Lysoganglioside-coated
plates
were
washed three times in PBS without Tween in all steps.
Plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin
(ThermoFisher Scientific) in PBS for 60 minutes at 37 °C.
Serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples serially dilu-
ted in 1% BSA (in PBS) were added to washed plates, then
incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next day, plates were
washed as described above and primary IgG antibody
binding was detected by adding 50 µL per well of diluted
alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human ƴ-
chain-specific
secondary
antibody
(polyclonal,
Cat#
A3312, Sigma Aldrich) and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C.
Final dilution of secondary antibody was determined
empirically for each antigen and validated for every new
antibody lot. Plates were developed at 26 °C for 2 h ±
15 min with 50 µL per well of 1 mg/mL p-nitrophenyl-
phosphatase (Sigma Aldrich) in 0.1 M diethanolamine
buffer (pH 9.8). Optical density values were measured at
405 nm on an automated BioTek microplate reader
(BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT) and corrected by
blanks (wells coated with antigen, without serum added).
All samples were assayed in duplicate and averaged.
Duplicates not matching with < 20% variance were repe-
ated. Titers represent the serum dilution at optical density
of 0.1 at 405 nm after 2 h. Known positive and negative
control samples were included on each plate to standar-
dize and monitor assay performance20,29. Each new lot of
all reagents and antibodies were validated using serum
samples with known titers.
Cell culture
SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (HTB-11, Manassas,
VA) were grown in complete F12-Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle Medium (ThermoFisher Scientific) as previously
described15. Complete media contained 10% fetal bovine
serum
(ThermoFisher
Scientific)
and
1%
penicillin–streptomycin antibiotic (ThermoFisher Scien-
tific). Cellular extracts used in the CaMKII assay were
centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein
concentrations of the extracts were determined by Brad-
ford assay using the Protein Assay Kit II (Bio-Rad, Her-
cules, CA).
CaMKII activity assay
Assay for CaMKII activity was performed as previously
described15. In brief, SK-N-SH cells were plated in six-
well plates at 2.5 million cells/well and incubated over-
night in complete F12-DMEM, at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The
next day, cells were serum starved for 30 minutes in
serum-free F12 media with 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM KCl, and
0.4 mM MgCl2, then stimulated for 30 minutes with
patient sera or CSF diluted 1:100 in the same media or
with media alone (basal control). Cells were harvested,
centrifuged, solubilized in 0.165 mL of protein extraction

 buffer with protease inhibitors (Soybean Trypsin Inhi-
bitor, PMSF, Leupeptin, and Aprotinin, Sigma Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO), and homogenized. Enzymatic activity was
measured using the CaMKII assay system (Promega,
Madison, WI) per manufacturer’s instructions. In brief,
5 μL of cell lysate was incubated with 50 μM peptide
substrate, buffers and ATP [γ-32P] (Perkin Elmer) for
2 minutes at 30 °C. Samples were spotted onto capture
membranes and washed. Radioactivity retained on the
membrane was measured by scintillation counter (Beck-
man Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) and used to calculate
specific activity of the CaMKII enzyme (pmoL/min/μg) as
described in kit instructions. The protein concentration of
each sample was used to standardize the CaMKII enzyme
activity, and the percentage of specific activity of baseline
(basal control) was calculated for each sample where the
basal level was set at 100%. All samples were assayed
in
triplicate
and results
were
averaged.
Sera from
patients with known high and low CaMKII activity and a
basal control sample were included to standardize the
assay.
Parent-reported clinical outcomes
The first author, who was not involved in patient care,
performed a qualitative–quantitative analysis of clinical
notes. The senior author (R.E.F.), the primary treating
physician, confirmed this analysis for accuracy. The notes
were analyzed for specific symptoms mentioned in
regards
to
improvements
and
worsening.
Areas
of
improvement were quantified if they occurred in ≥ 10% of
the participants. Symptom improvement was classified
into eight non-exclusive categories (See Table 2), “other”
and “no improvement.” The frequency of these reported
improvements across patients was calculated and the total
number of improved symptoms was also analyzed for
each patient. A similar chart review was performed for
determining frequency of adverse effects, although there
was no lower limit for reporting the frequency of adverse
effects.
Cognitive and behavioral outcome measures
The ABC is a 58-item questionnaire56 that measures
disruptive behaviors and has convergent and divergent
validity57. The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) is a 65-
item questionnaire that measures the severity of social
skill deficits across five domains58, which has good con-
cordance with the ADOS59. Caretakers are asked to
complete these questionnaires prior to each clinical visit
to assist in the evaluation of the change in symptoms at
each visit. One important caveat is that caretakers were
not required to fill out these questionnaires as declining
did not ethically prevent their child from appropriate
medical care.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with SAS 9.4 (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and MATLAB (The Mathworks,
Natick, MA). Graphs were produced using Excel version
14.0 (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA). To determine
whether any significant change occurred in behavior
questionnaires with treatment an analysis of variance
implemented as a mixed-model regression was utilized.
The models included random effect of time (before/dur-
ing treatment) and intercept to account for individual
symptom level. The models tested the a priori hypothesis
that a significant change in the outcome measure occur-
red with treatment and used a α ≤ 0.05. All of the available
questionnaire data were used for each participant. There
was no imputation for missing data. Participants without
questionnaire data both before and after the start of
treatment were excluded. The Cohen’s d’ effect size was
calculated for each statistical comparison.
We sought to evaluate whether biomarkers of auto-
immunity could predict treatment response. As the
Cunningham panel was the only frequently abnormal
panel, only the Cunningham panel was used to predict
treatment
response.
We
examined
the
relationship
between the change in questionnaire score with IVIG
treatment and the baseline components of the Cunning-
ham panel. Only the total scores for the ABC and SRS
questionnaires were examined to reduce excessive statis-
tical comparisons. However, we also examined the rela-
tionship between the Anti-Dopamine D2L/D1 titer ratio
and irritability subscale of the ABC, as this relationship
was previously reported26. We applied a logarithmic
transformation with a base of 2 to the autoantibody titers
as they increase in exponential steps. As many individuals
completed multiple questionnaires both before and dur-
ing the treatment period, we calculated the average total
score of all questionnaires during treatment minus the
average total score prior to treatment for each individual
as a difference score. We then calculated the correlation
between this difference score vs immune biomarkers.
We then defined responders by examining the histo-
gram of the change in the ABC and SRS scores to
determine the distribution of responders. As the scale of
the Cunningham panel components are quite different, in
order to conduct calculations on the same scale across all
components, as is standard is statistical linear models,
were mean-centered at zero and normalized to have a
standard deviation of unity. We then determined whether
the components of the Cunningham panel could be used
to predict which participants were responders and which
where non-responders using Fisher Discriminant Analysis
in MATLAB using in-house developed routine. Dis-
criminant analysis creates a linear function that uses the
input component (i.e., components of the Cunningham
Connery et al. Translational Psychiatry  (2018) 8:148 
Page 4 of 14
 panel) to calculate a score that represent whether a par-
ticular participant is more like a responder or non-
responses. The statistical distribution of these Fisher
Discriminant Analysis scores was estimated via Kernel
Density Estimation and a threshold was determined which
could optimally divide the scores calculated by the linear
discriminant function for the participants into responders
and non-responders (i.e., a binary classifier). We report
the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the dis-
criminant function.
Results
Characterization of AIE
NMDA receptor autoantibodies were negative in all of
the 34 patients in which it was tested. GAD65 titer ele-
vation was found in three (5%; 13.00, 0.11, 0.07; normal
(nl) < 0.02) of the 60 patients in whom it was tested. The
PNP was positive for four (6%) of the 63 patients in which
it was tested. For the PNP, two of the cases had VGCC
autoantibodies (N-type 0.13; nl < 0.03; P/Q-type 0.05, nl <
0.02) and two had striated muscle autoantibodies (1:960
and 1:1920, nl < 1:120).
The Cunningham panel was considered to be is positive
only when one of the four autoantibody titers was positive
in the ELISA AND at the same time autoantibody-
mediated CaMKII activation was positive (> 130 above the
basal rate of CaMKII in SKNSH human neuronal cell lines
as previously described22). In this way, the CaMKII ele-
vation was used as a functional confirmation of the con-
sequence of elevated autoantibodies in the ELISA. In the
ELISA, the antineuronal autoantibodies were positive
when anti-tubulin was ≥ 2000 titer, anti-lysoganglioside
was ≥ 640 titer, anti-D1R was ≥ 4000 titer, and anti-D2R
was ≥ 16,000 titer. Endpoint titers were determined at
0.092 cutoff and the titers were determined by routine
ELISA as described above.
Using our criterion, the Cunningham panel was positive
in 44 (57%) of the 77 patients in which it was performed.
In 67% of the 33 cases, the Cunningham panel was
negative because of a normal CaMKII, whereas it was
negative because of normal ELISA autoantibody titers in
30% of the cases and was normal for both ELISA auto-
antibodies and CaMKII in only one case.
In addition to the aforementioned tests, patients with
severe behavioral or medical symptoms including drug-
resistance epilepsy and/or immunodeficiency were con-
sidered candidates for IVIG treatment. If the patient was
previously non-responsive to IVIG treatment, alternative
treatments were considered. Also, consideration was
given to whether other treatments should be tried as an
alternative to IVIG. The severity of the ASD and asso-
ciated behavioral and other symptoms were a determinant
when deciding whether a trial of IVIG was warranted.
A trial of IVIG was recommended in 49 (60%) of the
patients evaluated (See Fig. 1). Thirty-six (73%) of the
patients in whom it was recommended received the
treatment with five receiving the treatment by another
care team. We reviewed the response to IVIG for patients
under our care.

was 2 g/kg monthly with the most common dosing 1 g/kg/

 day for 2 days monthly. Of the 31 patients, the dose and/
or frequency of treatment was adjusted in 13 (42%) to
provide an optimal effect. The dose may have been
decreased to minimize adverse effects, whereas the
treatment interval may have been increased or decreased
if the effect appeared to last longer or shorter than the
original 4 week interval. Overall, 10% and 40% of the
patients, respectively, did best on a higher and lower dose
than 2 g/kg/month.
All patients started on monthly dosing but 30% changed
to a different dosing interval, with 17%, 6%, and 6%
receiving the treatment at 3, 6, and 2 week intervals,
respectively. In several cases, extending the treatment
interval
resulted
in
behavioral
regression,
requiring
shortening the interval to restore treatment effectiveness
(See Case #3 below).
Parent-reported outcomes
The majority of the parents reported improvements in
communication and/or language with fewer reporting
improvements in aberrant behavior (Table 2). About a
quarter reported improvement in repetitive behavior and
academics. Between 10% and 30% reported improvements
in social interactions, tics, motor function, and seizures,
only three parents did not report improvements. Seventy-
one percent (22/31) of patients reported improvements in
two or more symptoms and 90% (28/31) of the patients
demonstrated improvements in one or more symptoms
(Table 3).
Behavioral questionnaire outcomes
For 21 and 20 of the treated children the SRS and ABC
behavioral questionnaires were acquired both before and
during IVIG treatment, respectively.
In Fig. 2a, all subscales of the SRS demonstrated
improvement with IVIG treatment, although only a few of
the improvements reached statistical significance (Fig. 2a).
SRS subscales for cognition (F(1,57) = 4.71, p < 0.05, d’ =
0.58) and mannerisms (F(1,57) = 13.34, p < 0.001, d’ =
0.97) significantly improved with medium and large effect
sizes,
respectively.

 significantly with a medium effect size (F(1,57) = 4.40, p
= 0.04, d’ = 0.57). Change in communication (F(1,57) =
2.60, p = 0.11, d’ = 0.43) and motivation (F(1,57) = 2.99,
p = 0.09, d’ = 0.46) SRS subscales were borderline sig-
nificant with medium effect sizes, whereas the change in
the awareness subscale was not statistically significant (F
(1,57) = 0.02, p = 0.89, d’ = 0.04).
In Fig. 2b, all subscales of the ABC demonstrated
improvement with IVIG treatment with all but one
reaching statistical significance (Fig. 2b). ABC subscales
for irritability (F(1,57) = 5.81, p = 0.02, d’ = 0.64), lethargy
(social withdrawal) (F(1,57) = 5.75, p = 0.02, d’ = 0.64),
hyperactivity
(F(1,57) = 4.63,
p = 0.04,
d’ = 0.57)
and
inappropriate speech (F(1,57) = 5.13, p = 0.02, d’ = 0.60)
significantly improved with medium effect sizes. The total
ABC score improved significantly with a large effect size
(F(1,57) = 9.88, p = 0.003, d’ = 0.83). The improvement in
the ABC stereotypy subscales was not significant and had
a small effect size (F(1,57) = 1.90, p = 0.17, d’ = 0.36).

 ABC. Of the five biomarkers, the change in the total ABC
score resulting from IVIG treatment was associated with
the change in the anti-D2R antibody (r = 0.55, p < 0.05;
Fig. 3a) and anti-tublin Antibody (r = 0.49, p < 0.05;
Fig. 3b). In addition, as hypothesized, the anti-D2L
titer/anti-D1
titer
ratio
was
significantly
associated
with the Irritability subscale of the ABC (r = 0.64, p < 0.01;
Fig. 3c).
IVIG responder analysis
The change in SRS scores is modest when it occurs,
whereas the change in ABC scores can be rather marked
when it occurs (Fig. 4). Change in scores of the two
questionnaires correlated well with each other (r = 0.52, p
= 0.01). Based on the distribution of scores a cutoff ≥ + 1
used to define a responder for the questionnaire scores.
Using this criterion, five (25%) individuals were IVIG non-
responders based on both questionnaires, three (15%)
were IVIG responders based on the SRS only, four (20%)
were IVIG responders based on the ABC only, and eight
(40%) were responders based on both questionnaires. A
criterion of two or more reported improvements in
symptoms was used as a cutoff for parental reported
improvement. Using these criteria, 52%, 60%, and 65% of
patients were responders as defined by the SRS, ABC, and
parental report. Thus, we believe that the criterion we
used separated the groups well into responders and non-
responders.
The Cunningham panel predicted response to IVIG
treatment with an accuracy of 81% with a sensitivity of
90% and a specificity of 67% based on the ABC scores;
with an accuracy of 88% with a sensitivity of 100% and a
specificity of 75% based on the SRS scores; and with an
accuracy of 88% with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity
of 67% based on parental scores.
Temporal characteristic of response
The speed at which behavioral effects of the treatment
arose and the duration of these effects were rather vari-
able from patient to patient. However, ABC responders
(Fig. 5a) demonstrated a clear response that was variable
in the rate at which it improved across patients, with some
patients showing a very rapid decrease in ABC score and
Fig. 3 Baseline antibody titers are related to improvement in Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) scores following intravenous
immunoglobulin (IVIG). Greater improvement in ABC was related to high titers of antidopamine D2 receptor (D2L) antidopamine and anti-tubulin
autoantibodies. A higher ratio of D2L to D1 antidopamine antibody titer was related to greater improvements in the irritability subscale of the ABC
with IVIG treatment

 others showing a gradual improvement in ABC score. In
contrast, non-responders showed a variable response with
ABC score worsening and improving over time for many.
One non-responder demonstrated a bout of severe
hyperactivity that transiently increase the total ABC score
dramatically.
Long-term outcomes
Of the 31 patients who were initially treated with IVIG,
77% (24/31) continued with IVIG treatment long-term (>
1 year). The majority of these 24 patients, 88% (21/24),
found continuing benefit from the treatment. Of the seven
that stopped the IVIG treatment, 29% (2/7) stopped
because of lack of insurance coverage, 29% (2/7) stopped
because adverse effects, 14% (1/7) stopped in order to try
a more intense immunosuppression treatment, 14% (1/7)
stopped as a trial and requested to restart because of
behavioral regression and 14% (1/7) was only prescribed
one treatment. Only 6% (2/31) of the patients stopped the
treatment because of lack of benefit and only 10% (3/13)
who did not stop the treatment found limited continuing
benefit.
Adverse effects
Sixty-five percent (20/31) of patients reported adverse
effects, most commonly headaches and vomiting (Table
4). Many adverse effects were limited to the 48–72 h
period immediately following the infusion. Treatments
were individualized to each patient to minimize adverse
effects by prescribing pre-infusion anti-pyretic (ibuprofen
10 mg/kg
oral;
PO),
steroids
(solumedrol
1 mg/kg
intravaneous; IV), fluids (~ 20 ml/kg ½ normal saline over
1 h), anti-emetics (ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg IV), anti-
histamine (diphenhydramine 0.5 mg/kg IV/PO) and/or
post infusion fluids. These pretreatments were prescribed
in 84%, 81%, 32%, 26%, 19%, and 6%, respectively. Three
patients were prescribed anti-emetics up to 72 h post
infusion. One patient with baseline idiopathic hyperten-
sion was given aggressive hydration pre and post infusion
to prevent fluctuation in blood pressure.

 Fig. 6 Case examples of responders to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment. Case #1 is a child with autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) and mitochondrial dysfunction that had a sudden worsening in behavior at 8 years of age. a Initiating IVIG significantly improved
behavior as measured by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and social function as measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). b The
writing sample on the left shows the patient’s handwriting a few months before IVIG treatment, and the sample on the right shows the patient’s
handwriting 2 days after his first IVIG treatment. Case #2 is a boy with sudden regression found to have an N-Type Voltage-Gated Calcium-Channel
autoantibody. c IVIG treatment significantly improved autoantibody titers. Case #3 is a girl with multiple regressions and severe ASD and related
symptoms. d IVIG normalized CamKinase II activity but CamKinase II activity increased to abnormal levels and behavior, as measured by the ABC and
SRS, worsened with increasing the IVIG treatment interval to every 6 weeks. Behavior improved after reinstating the original every 4 weeks dosing
interval

 reciprocal conversation, exhibited limited eye contact, and
suffered from severe restricted interests, anxiety, and
frequent meltdowns. A medical evaluation demonstrated
that he had biomarkers consistent with mitochondrial
dysfunction, as manifested by repeated elevated lactate,
pyruvate,
and
alanine-to-lysine
ratio
(mean
(N,SD)
2.3 mM/L (25,0.65), nl < 1.3; 0.20 mM/L (24,0.5), nl < 0.08;
4.0 (26,1.96), nl < 2.5, respectively) and mitochondrial
buccal swab demonstrating depressed citrate synthase
(55%) and elevated complex I (178%) and IV (236%)
function. A mitochondrial cocktail was started, including
ubiquinol, L-carnitine, creatine monophosphate, niacin,
pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, riboflavin, thiamine, coba-
lamin, and folinic acid. During the first treatment year he
demonstrated improved adaptability, socialization, and
ASD-related behavior. However, improvements in socia-
lization plateaued and behavior worsened (See Fig. 6a),
prompting further investigation. A Cunningham panel
showed elevations in anti-tubulin antibodies (2000; nl =
250–1000) and CaMKII (151, nl < 130), prompting a
trial of IVIG at 1 g/kg/day × 2 days every month. Within
2 days of the IVIG treatment, his handwriting significantly
improved
(See
Fig.
6b).
With
each
subsequent
treatment he progressively gained skills, including sig-
nificant improvements in language. After 5 months, he
began having reciprocal conversations and was able to
describe how IVIG made him “feel”. After 6 months, his
restricted interests resolved. After 18 months of IVIG
treatment, he has been able to sit with peers in a noisy
gymnasium and engage in social conversation as part of a
small group.
Case 2
At ~ 3½ years of age, a previously normally developing
child underwent a slow regression lasting 6 months. His
parents pursued a language assessment at the beginning
of the regression because he became less verbal but the
evaluation did not demonstrate any significant abnorm-
alities. However, as the third year of his life progressed, he
lost speech, social interactions, developed repetitive
movements, and sleep disturbance with an inability to stay
asleep throughout the night. A repeat language evaluation
at
3
years
11
months
demonstrated
a
significant
(17 standardized point) loss in language ability as com-
pared with the evaluation earlier in the year. At 4 years of
age he was diagnosed with ASD. Gluten- and dairy-free
diet reportedly improved focus and attention and speech,
occupational, physical, and applied behavioral analysis
therapies began. Family history was remarkable for
learning disabilities in maternal family and developmental
delays in the paternal family, but the mother, father, and
sibling did not have a history of neurodevelopmental
disorders. He was otherwise healthy.
He was evaluated in our clinic at 4 years 6 months of
age. On examination, he was active, cooperative, and
anxious with very limited verbal communication skills but
demonstrated eye contact. A mitochondrial and genetic
workup (Chromosomal Microarray and Fragile X) and
overnight EEG were unremarkable. FRA, NMDA, and
GAD65 antibodies were negative, however, PNP demon-
strated an elevated N-Type Calcium-Channel antibody
(0.13 nmol/L; nl < 0.03 nmol/L). A magnetic resonance
imaging scan of the brain was normal and lumbar punc-
ture demonstrated low protein (16; nl ≥ 20).
IVIG treatment was initiated at 1 g/kg/day for 2 days.
Four weeks after the first IVIG infusion a marked
improvement occurred in near constant chewing, repeti-
tive movement, and severe sleep disruption. Five months
after the first treatment, some ASD symptoms started to
return, resulting in starting IVIG treatments on a monthly
to every other month schedule. The N-type VGCC anti-
body dropped to 0.09 nmol/l just prior to the second IVIG
treatment and then progressively further with additional
treatments, reaching a low of 0.4 nmol/l for several
months, and eventually dropping to 0.01 nmol/L (Fig. 6c).
The ABC total score dropped from 69 before treatment to
38 just before the second treatment with this decrease
paralleling the decrease in the N-type VGCC antibody.
Interestingly, there was an increase in the neuronal
acetylcholine receptor autoantibody during the treat-
ments course, which eventually decreased along with the
N-type VGCC antibody.
Case 3
This girl developed normally until about 3 years of age
when she experienced periodic episodes of abrupt loss of
previously acquired skills and developed other neu-
ropsychiatric symptoms. The most significant of these
regressions was at 4 years of age when she developed an
abrupt onset of repetitive behaviors, tics, poor con-
centration, emotional liability, separation anxiety, urinary
frequency and urgency, sleep disturbance, and aggressive
behavior. She was diagnosed with ASD at age 8 years of
age. At 9 years of age she developed partial complex sei-
zures, incompletely controlled by lamotrigine. At 7 years
of age, a Cunningham panel demonstrated a CaMKII
(135; nl < 130; See Fig. 6d) elevation. She was treated with
IVIG 1 g/kg/day for 2 days every month. Improvements
occurred in tics, academics, and seizure frequency, and
CaMKII normalized (Fig. 6d). After 6 months of treat-
ment, the interval of IVIG was extend to every 6 weeks.
The child’s behavior quickly regressed with a significant
increase in both the SRS and ABC scales and an increase
in the CaMKII in the abnormal range again (Fig. 6d).
After 6 months on monthly IVIG, her behavior improved
(Fig. 6d).

 Discussion
In this study, we examined 82 children with neurode-
velopmental disorders for biomarkers consistent with AIE
and considered for immunomodulatory treatment for
those with a clinical presentation and laboratory values
consistent with AIE. Of those who underwent IVIG
treatment using our care team, the majority had symp-
toms improvements as measured by standardized ques-
tionnaires. Although adverse effects were reported for the
majority of patients, they were mostly limited to the time
around the IVIG infusion, resulting in the great majority
of patients considering the benefits outweighing any
adverse effects.
Interestingly, in our cohort of patients who presented to
our ASD clinic, very few demonstrated autoantibodies
usually associated with AIE in children. Interestingly,
none of the patients was positive for NMDA receptor or
VGKC autoantibodies. Only 5% of the patient cohort was
positive for the GAD65 autoantibody with only one
GAD65 titer within a clinically significant range. This low
rate of positivity could explain the contradictory reports
of the association of the GAD65 autoantibody with ASD
as the rate of positivity may be very dependent on the
sample of ASD children studied40,60. The child with ASD
and the highest GAD65 titer also had type 1 diabetes,
which is a disorder known to be associated with the
GAD65 autoantibody31. This child was a responder to
IVIG. Interestingly, GAD65 may be functionally disrupted
in ASD in other ways besides an autoantibody mechan-
ism. For example, GAD65 is downregulated in the pre-
natal valproic acid and MIA animal models of ASD61–65
and in post-mortem brain from individuals with ASD66,67,
suggesting that it is a potentially important target of
pathology in individuals with ASD.
This is the first reported association of VGCC auto-
antibodies with ASD. The VGCC is associated with a wide
range of cognitive and motor disturbances68 and cere-
bellar degeneration in childhood69. The child positive for
the N-type VGCC demonstrated an abrupt onset of sleep
disturbance, repetitive behavior, and chewing on objects
in addition to language and social regression at the onset
of this disorder. IVIG treatment significantly and quickly
improved these symptoms. Interestingly, like the GAD
enzyme, ASD has been associated with non-autoimmune
disruption in calcium-channel function70. Thus, some
autoantibodies in individuals with ASD may merely
represent one mechanism that can disrupt common
pathophysiological disturbances leading to ASD.
Overall, the majority of parents of the patients treated
with IVIG found the treatment beneficial and believed
that the benefits outweighed any adverse effects. Close
observation was important to tailor the dose and fre-
quency of the treatment and minimize adverse effects.
Consistent with previous literature, IVIG treatment in this
study improved scores on the ABC41,44 and social inter-
actions42. Of the six studies using IVIG in the treatment
of ASD, three open-label studies, totaling 63 patients41–43
and one double-blind placebo-controlled study totaling 12
patients44 demonstrated a benefit, whereas two smaller
open-label studies, totaling 15 patients45,46, did not show
benefit. Two of the studies that demonstrated benefit
selected individuals with immune system abnormalities,
like the current study42,43. In contrast, the two open-label
studies that did not demonstrate benefit did not select for
immune abnormalities45,46. In addition, all previous stu-
dies used a lower dose of IVIG, usually 0.4 g/kg monthly.
Some have observed better response with higher doses of
IVIG71 potentially explaining the high rate of response in
our study. Clearly more research is needed to better
understand which subset of children with ASD can best
benefit from IVIG as well as the optimal dose and interval
for the treatment.
The majority of the ASD patients who had auto-
antibodies demonstrated elevations in autoantibodies
measured by the Cunningham panel along with an ele-
vation in the activation of CaMKII. Our analysis suggests
that two of the autoantibodies, the anti-tubulin and anti-
D2R were associated with responsiveness to IVIG treat-
ment, suggesting that these could be biomarkers to select
individuals who might benefit most from IVIG treatment.
It should be noted that the participants were selected
based on an elevated CaMKII, so this biomarker may have
been artificially fixed with a limited dynamic range
because
of
our
patient
selection
process,
thereby
decreasing its ability to be a predictive biomarker. As the
ABC was most closely associated with immune bio-
markers, it may be that the autoantibodies identified as
predictive of response to IVIG may be closely associated
with modulation of behavior as has been suggested in
Sydenham chorea22 and PANDAS23,26.
The limitations of this study include the small sample
size and the questionnaire-based outcome measures.
Furthermore, this study was not a systematic clinical trial
with comprehensive measurements of behavior, cogni-
tion, and language. Thus, further studies are needed to
better identify which specific symptoms are targeted by
IVIG treatment as well as the most-sensitive biomarkers
to identify which patients are most likely to respond to
IVIG treatment. Despite these limitations, our study
verifies previous reports that suggest that IVIG may be
useful in individuals with ASD who demonstrate bio-
markers of immune abnormalities.
