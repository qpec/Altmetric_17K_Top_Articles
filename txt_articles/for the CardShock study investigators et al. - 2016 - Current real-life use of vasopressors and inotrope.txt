Abstract
Background: Vasopressors and inotropes remain a cornerstone in stabilization of the severely impaired hemodynamics
and cardiac output in cardiogenic shock (CS). The aim of this study was to analyze current real-life use of these
medications, and their impact on outcome and on changes in cardiac and renal biomarkers over time in CS.
Methods: The multinational CardShock study prospectively enrolled 219 patients with CS. The use of
vasopressors and inotropes was analyzed in relation to the primary outcome, i.e., 90-day mortality, with
propensity score methods in 216 patients with follow-up data available. Changes in cardiac and renal biomarkers
over time until 96 hours from baseline were analyzed with linear mixed modeling.
Results: Patients were 67 (SD 12) years old, 26 % were women, and 28 % had been resuscitated from cardiac
arrest prior to inclusion. On average, systolic blood pressure was 78 (14) and mean arterial pressure 57 (11)
mmHg at detection of shock. 90-day mortality was 41 %. Vasopressors and/or inotropes were administered to
94 % of patients and initiated principally within the first 24 hours. Noradrenaline and adrenaline were given to
75 % and 21 % of patients, and 30 % received several vasopressors. In multivariable logistic regression, only
adrenaline (21 %) was independently associated with increased 90-day mortality (OR 5.2, 95 % CI 1.88, 14.7,
p = 0.002). The result was independent of prior cardiac arrest (39 % of patients treated with adrenaline), and the
association remained in propensity-score-adjusted analysis among vasopressor-treated patients (OR 3.0, 95 %
CI 1.3, 7.2, p = 0.013); this was further confirmed by propensity-score-matched analysis. Adrenaline was also
associated, independent of prior cardiac arrest, with marked worsening of cardiac and renal biomarkers during
the first days. Dobutamine and levosimendan were the most commonly used inotropes (49 % and 24 %). There
were no differences in mortality, whether noradrenaline was combined with dobutamine or levosimendan.
Conclusion: Among vasopressors and inotropes, adrenaline was independently associated with 90-day mortality
in CS. Moreover, adrenaline use was associated with marked worsening in cardiac and renal biomarkers. The
combined use of noradrenaline with either dobutamine or levosimendan appeared prognostically similar.

 Background
Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a devastating complication of not
only acute myocardial infarction (AMI) but also other car-
diac emergencies [1]. While the prognosis of CS caused by
AMI has improved, possibly due to increasing use of primary
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as early revascu-
larization, mortality still remains unacceptably high [2, 3].
Cardiogenic shock is a result of severe impairment of
cardiac output, and also of neurohormonal and cytokine
activation, leading to systemic inflammatory response syn-
drome [1]. Fluid resuscitation, vasopressor and inotrope
medications, and mechanical circulatory support have
been used to stabilize severely impaired hemodynamics.
However, the most commonly used form of mechanical
support, the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was not
demonstrated to be of benefit in the recent IABP SHOCK
II trial [4, 5]; nor have other devices yet been demon-
strated to improve the prognosis of patients in CS [6].
Thus, use of vasopressors and inotropes remains a corner-
stone of hemodynamic support in CS [7–10]. There are
few data, however, to guide clinicians in the choice of spe-
cific agents. The overall benefit of vasoactive medications
is unclear and safety concerns remain, as they may lead to
increased myocardial oxygen and energy consumption.
Moreover, they can have cardiotoxic effects and provoke
arrhythmias [11–13], for instance, via beta-adrenergic
stimulation resulting in excessive increase in free cytosolic
Ca2+ and Ca2+ channel activation in cardiac myocytes.
We analyzed the current real-life use of vasoactive medi-
cations in a prospective observational study of patients
with CS of various etiological causes. The associations be-
tween outcome and the use of vasopressors and inotropes
were assessed to detect possible differences in safety pro-
files of vasopressor and inotropic therapy. We also assessed
changes in hemodynamic parameters and biomarkers asso-
ciated with the use of these medications.
Methods
In the
CardShock
study
(Clinicaltrials.gov
identifier:
NCT01374867) 219 patients with CS were prospectively
enrolled at nine hospitals in eight European countries
(Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Italy, Poland,
Portugal, and Spain) in collaboration with the Global RE-
search on Acute Conditions Team (GREAT) network.
Recruitment started in October 2010 and ended on 31
December 2012 [14].
In addition to an acute cardiac cause, the inclusion cri-
teria consisted of systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90 mmHg
(in the absence of hypovolemia or after adequate fluid
challenge) for at least 30 minutes, or need of vasopres-
sor therapy to maintain adequate perfusion pressure,
and signs of hypoperfusion (any of the following: al-
tered mental status/confusion, cold periphery, oliguria,
blood lactate >2 mmol/l). Patients had to be over 18 years
of age and be included within 6 h of the first identification
of shock. Informed consent was obtained from patients
for study participation (apart from Copenhagen; see
“Acknowledgements”). The main exclusion criteria were
CS after cardiac surgery and ongoing hemodynamically
significant arrhythmia as the cause of hypotension.
We recorded basic demographic data, previous med-
ical history, and clinical, biochemical, and hemodynamic
parameters on detection of shock and until 96 h after
the study baseline. In addition cardiac index was regis-
tered in patients with a pulmonary artery catheter (n =
82 (38 %)). The etiology of CS was classified as acute
coronary syndrome (ACS) or non-ACS; ACS was de-
fined as ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or
myocardial infarction without ST elevation (non-STEMI).
Management of CS was registered in detail including intra-
venous medications, mechanical circulatory support, and
ventilatory support. The use of vasoactive medications was
recorded during the first 96 h after the detection of shock.
Noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, vasopressin, and
terlipressin were categorized as vasopressors, whereas do-
butamine, levosimendan, and milrinone and enoximone
(phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitors (PDE3i)) were categorized
as inotropes. In addition to the use of each separate vaso-
active drug, we analyzed the simultaneous use of different
vasopressors and the combinations of vasopressors and
inotropes. Serial blood samples were collected in 178 pa-
tients at 0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h; plasma was
immediately frozen and stored at −80 °C. Creatinine, high-
sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT), and N-terminal pro-B-
type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (Roche Diagnostics,
Basel, Switzerland) were analyzed centrally from these
samples. The endpoint of interest was 90-day all-cause
mortality; three patients had missing follow-up data after
hospital discharge. The CardShock study was approved by
local ethics committees at the participating centers (see
“Acknowledgements”) and conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki.
Statistical analyses
Results are presented as number (n) and percentage (%)
for categorical variables, and the mean with standard devi-
ation (SD) or the median with interquartile range (IQR)
for continuous variables, as appropriate. Group compari-
sons were performed using the Fisher exact or chi-square
tests for categorical variables, and the t test or Mann-
Whitney U test for continuous variables, as appropriate.
Differences between groups over time in changes in bio-
markers and hemodynamic parameters were tested with
linear mixed modeling. Resuscitation-adjusted differences
between groups at separate time points were assessed with
linear regression. Due to skewed distribution the bio-
markers were log-transformed to normalize the distribu-
tion and the residuals in these analyses. We performed

 multivariable logistic regression to evaluate independent
associations between medications and mortality, adjusting
for significant mortality-predicting variables included in
the CardShock prediction model: age, previous myocardial
infarction, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG),
ACS as the etiological form of CS, left ventricular ejec-
tion fraction (LVEF), blood lactate, and confusion/al-
tered mental status at baseline [14]; also gender and
SBP were included in the model. Further adjustment
included variables such as prior resuscitation (cardiac
arrest), baseline creatinine, and IABP treatment.
To reduce bias and increase precision in analyses asses-
sing the effect of treatment on mortality, we used propen-
sity score adjustment and matching [15]. The variables
chosen for propensity score analyses were potential con-
founders [16]; they were chosen based on clinical rele-
vance and previous publications [5], giving priority, due to
limited sample size, to variables believed or observed to be
related to outcome [17], and on achieving balance be-
tween matched groups. The final propensity score was es-
timated with the following variables, also including strong
predictors of outcome (i.e., the variables in the CardShock
risk prediction model, as described previously): age,
gender, medical history (myocardial infarction, CABG,
hypertension, renal insufficiency), CS due to acute cor-
onary syndrome, resuscitation prior to inclusion and
initial presentation (confusion, blood lactate, creatinine,
SBP, sinus rhythm, and LVEF). The score estimate was
converted into a logit scale for propensity score adjust-
ment analyses.
Propensity-score-matched subgroup analysis was per-
formed both as sensitivity analysis and to corroborate the
results from adjusted analyses of the impact of adrenaline
on mortality. To maximize the sample size, patients with
missing data were included, using the multiple imputation
method with 3 imputations after 10 iterations; for LVEF
the proportion of missing data was 5 %, and was 1 % or
less for other variables used in matching. A 1:1 nearest
neighbor match without replacement was used with a
caliper <0.2 of the standard error of the logits of the
propensity scores [18]. Balance between the matched
groups was assessed as the standardized mean differ-
ences of the propensity scores and covariates used, and
as the average of absolute standardized mean differ-
ences of the covariates.
We used the Kaplan-Meier method for unadjusted
and Cox regression for adjusted survival analyses; the
assumption of proportional hazards was checked with
parallelism of log-log survival curves. Odds ratios (OR)
and hazards ratios (HR) are shown with 95 % confi-
dence intervals (95 % CI). We considered p values
<0.05 as statistically significant. We performed statis-
tical analyses with SPSS 23 statistical software (IBM
Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). Additionally, IBM SPSS
Statistics Essentials for R and SPSS PS Matching plugin
[19] were used for propensity score matching.
Results
Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. A compre-
hensive description of the study population has been pub-
lished previously [14]. Briefly, the mean age of patients
was 67 (12) years and 26 % were women. On average, SBP
was 78 (14) mmHg, mean arterial pressure 57 (11) mmHg,
and heart rate 90 (28) beats/minute. LVEF was markedly
reduced, 33 (14) %. ACS was the most common etiological
cause of CS (81 % patients), and 84 % of these patients
had STEMI. The characteristics of patients with CS of
ACS and non-ACS etiology have been described recently
[14]. Overall 90-day mortality was 41 %. Compared with
survivors, non-survivors were older, more frequently had
previous medical history of, for example, myocardial in-
farction, CABG, and renal insufficiency, and had lower
LVEF, a worse biomarker profile, and less frequently sinus
rhythm at baseline (Additional file 1). Furthermore, 60 pa-
tients (28 %) were resuscitated prior to inclusion.
Use of vasopressors and inotropes
Vasopressors and inotropes were administered to 94 % of
patients, and they were almost invariably initiated within
the first 24 h (vasopressors in 98 % and inotropes in 94 %
of patients). Noradrenaline (administered to 75 % of pa-
tients), dopamine (26 % of patients) and adrenaline (21 %
of patients) were the most common vasopressors, while do-
butamine (49 %) and levosimendan (24 %) were the most
frequently used inotropes. Of note, a fair proportion of pa-
tients receiving adrenaline (39 %) were resuscitated from
cardiac arrest prior to inclusion. The use of the medica-
tions, mortality effect, and maximum rates and duration of
infusion are shown in Table 2. The use of vasopressors and
inotropes was similar in patients with ACS and non-ACS.
Around half of the patients (n = 118; 55 %) received
vasopressor-inotrope combinations, most often nor-
adrenaline with either dobutamine (n = 81) or levosi-
mendan (n = 47). The maximum noradrenaline dose was
higher when used with dobutamine than with levosimen-
dan (median 0.5 (IQR 0.30–0.99) vs 0.21 (0.12–0.38) μg/
kg/min, p < 0.001).
A large proportion (29 %) of patients were treated ex-
clusively with vasopressor(s) and one third of patients
(n = 65) received more than one vasopressor (with or
without concomitant inotropes). Of note, 10 % of pa-
tients received only inotropes.
In univariate regression analysis, the use of noradrenaline,
adrenaline, vasopressin/terlipressin, vasopressor combin-
ation, or combination of dobutamine with vasopressor(s)
but not levosimendan with vasopressor(s), were associated
with increased 90-day mortality (Table 2, and Fig. 1).

 Adrenaline and 90-day mortality
The characteristics of patients who received or did not re-
ceive adrenaline are shown in Table 1. Additional file 2
shows a comparison within the subgroup of vasopressor-
treated patients in relation to initial signs of hemodynamic
stress and hypoperfusion, and to use of mechanical venti-
latory and circulatory support.
A multivariable logistic regression model with vari-
ables included in the CardShock prediction model
showed that only adrenaline was independently associ-
ated with increased 90-day mortality: OR 5.3, 95 % CI
1.88, 14.7, p = 0.002. Further adjustment with prior resus-
citation, renal function or IABP treatment did not change
the results in the model. The association remained similar

Kaplan-Meier analyses confirmed the association be-
tween adrenaline and increased 90-day mortality within this
subgroup (Fig. 2a). The association remained consistent
even after propensity score adjustment (Fig. 2b and
Additional file 3). A subgroup analysis with propensity
score matching in the three imputed cohorts produced
a pool of 40 matched pairs. As Additional file 4 shows,
no marked imbalances remained in the propensity
score, the covariates used, or the average of the abso-
lute standardized mean differences of the covariates

 (Additional file 4). On analysis of 90-day mortality in
the three matched cohorts, the pooled OR for adrenaline
was 2.8 (95 % CI 1.1, 7.1, p = 0.03). The Kaplan-Meier
survival curve for a matched cohort is shown in Fig. 2c.
By contrast, Fig. 3 shows that after propensity score
adjustment the two most frequent vasopressor-inotrope
combinations, namely noradrenaline with either levosi-
mendan or dobutamine, were associated with similar 90-
day mortality (OR for noradrenaline-dobutamine = 1.03,
95 % CI 0.3, 3.9, p = 0.97).
Impact of adrenaline on organ function
When comparing adrenaline with other
vasopressors
(mainly noradrenaline and dopamine), the cardiac index
and blood pressure were similar by 96 h in both subgroups
(Fig. 4). However, cardiovascular and renal biomarker levels
were much worse in patients who received adrenaline, with
a more pronounced increase compared to other vasopres-
sors over the initial 96 h after detection of shock (Fig. 4).
When the analyses were repeated with adjustment for
resuscitation before enrollment the differences remained
significant (Fig. 4). Furthermore, subgroup analysis of non-
resuscitated patients showed similar detrimental effects of
adrenaline on organ function (Additional file 5). Patients
treated with adrenaline more often had altered mental sta-
tus (Additional file 2), and received higher maximum infu-
sion rates of concomitant noradrenaline, or dobutamine
(Additional file 6). In addition, lactate levels were higher in
patients receiving adrenaline, with a 4-day median of 3.7
(IQR 1.8–7.1) mmol/l vs 1.3 (IQR 0.9–1.8) mmol/l in pa-
tients receiving other vasopressors.
By contrast, biomarker measurements did not demon-
strate any clinically relevant differences between dobutamine
and levosimendan when combined with noradrenaline, and
the improvement in hemodynamics was similar in the two
groups (Additional file 7).
Discussion
This study describes the contemporary use of vasoactive
medications and their association with 90-day survival in
Fig. 3 Survival-probability curves for propensity-score-adjusted Cox regression analysis for use of dobutamine (dashed line) and levosimendan
(solid line) with noradrenaline. Adjusted for logit of the propensity score, which was estimated with the following variables: age, gender, medical
history (myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, hypertension, renal insufficiency), CS of acute coronary syndrome etiology,
resuscitation prior to inclusion and initial presentation (confusion, blood lactate, creatinine, systolic blood pressure, sinus rhythm, and left
ventricular ejection fraction). Of note, patients who received both dobutamine and levosimendan, or adrenaline were excluded. NS not significant

 an unselected patient population with CS. Combined
use of vasopressors and inotropes was common, mostly
noradrenaline with either dobutamine or levosimendan.
Adrenaline, regardless of the maximum infusion rate, was
consistently associated with worse outcome. In addition,
despite reaching similar hemodynamic stabilization as in
patients treated with other vasopressors, patients treated
with adrenaline had significant worsening in cardiac and
renal biomarker profiles. We observed no difference in
90-day mortality between patients who received combin-
ation of dobutamine and noradrenaline and those who re-
ceived levosimendan in combination with noradrenaline.
In light of previous data suggesting that adrenaline is less
safe and has more side effects than other vasoactive medi-
cations, the use of adrenaline in the present study was
unexpectedly frequent [13, 20, 21]. While adrenaline is
recommended for resuscitation during cardiac arrest, most
patients treated with adrenaline in the CardShock study,
however, had not been resuscitated. More importantly, our
study shows that adrenaline is associated with 90-day mor-
tality independent of prior cardiac arrest, and even after
further multivariable adjustment or using propensity score
methods. Furthermore, compared with use of other vaso-
pressors, adrenaline is associated with marked aggravation
of cardiac stress, myocardial injury and kidney dysfunction
during the 4 days following detection of shock. Strikingly,
these associations remained consistent in the subgroup of
patients with no prior cardiac arrest. This may reflect an
increase in myocardial oxygen consumption, excessive
vasoconstriction and/or direct organ (cardiac, kidney, or
other) toxic effects due to intense adrenergic stimulation
[22, 23]. Based on these findings, alternative treatment
strategies seem preferable. These would include the use of
other vasopressors and/or inotropes, or more advanced
therapy, such as mechanical circulatory support, in CS
patients requiring potent hemodynamic stabilization. The
benefit of such strategies also needs to be promptly and
properly investigated.
Noradrenaline was the most commonly used vasopres-
sor; a finding in line with the current recommendations
[7, 8, 22, 24]. Dopamine was also given to one fourth of
patients. Although commonly classified as a vasopressor
[8, 22, 25], most patients actually received it at low-
intermediate, or “renal-inotropic” doses [26]. However,

 the drug has failed to show beneficial effects on outcome
[27, 28]. Moreover, compared to noradrenaline it has a
weaker vasopressor effect and more adverse effects [29, 30].
A randomized study comparing dopamine with noradren-
aline in shock showed that arrhythmia was more frequent
in the dopamine group, the drug was discontinued more
often due to severe arrhythmia, and the outcome was worse
in the subgroup with CS [11]. As the present study was
observational, the management of patients was at the
discretion of the local physicians in charge. Lack of ran-
domized data and evidence on the benefits of different
vasoactive medications, and concern about possible adverse
effects make the choice between different agents challen-
ging [20, 31]. In addition, local practices in the choice of
vasoactive medication may vary, as has been reported in
studies of acute heart failure [32, 33].
The paucity of scientific data on the use of inotropes
and their effect on mortality in AMI complicated by CS is
highlighted by a recent Cochrane review [34]. While vaso-
pressors are indicated for correcting low perfusion pres-
sure, inotropes are used to increase cardiac output in CS.
A large retrospective analysis of three cohorts with acute
heart failure suggested that combining a vasopressor with
an inodilator (i.e., dobutamine, levosimendan, or PDE3i)
in CS was associated with lower mortality compared to va-
sopressors alone [35]. In turn, our study showed that the
combination of noradrenaline with levosimendan was
not associated with excessive mortality. Then again,
while the combination of dobutamine and noradren-
aline was associated with increased mortality in un-
adjusted analysis, the adjusted analyses showed a similar
outcome for the combination of noradrenaline with either
dobutamine or levosimendan. More importantly, both
achieved similar hemodynamic stabilization with no
clinically relevant differences in serial cardiac or renal bio-
markers. Altogether, levosimendan and dobutamine ap-
peared to be equally useful alternatives to be combined
with noradrenaline in the setting of unselected patients
with CS. Considering the deleterious outcome related to
adrenaline, a combination of dobutamine or levosimendan
with noradrenaline could be the preferred choice in pa-
tients needing inotropic support.
There are some limitations to be acknowledged. First,
there was no formal standardization of management in
the CardShock study. However, the primary goal was to
describe the current use of vasopressors and inotropes in
CS and data on vasoactive treatments were prospectively
collected. Second, the total dose of vasoactive medica-
tions, and duration of the maximum dose might have
given further depth to the interpretation of data. However,
these details were not registered. Third, the numbers of
patients in the treatment groups including adrenaline
or levosimendan were limited, and caution in the inter-
pretation of the results is advocated. As the study lacks
randomization, confounding by indication is a possible
bias when assessing possible effect of adrenaline on
mortality. Propensity score methods were used to
minimize this bias; however, these methods allowed us
only to account for the measured variables and the esti-
mates of treatment effect may be susceptible to bias
due to unknown and unmeasured confounding vari-
ables. Nevertheless, the association between adrenaline
use and poor outcome seemed consistent. Finally, we
classified dopamine as a vasopressor, although actual
doses used and combining with other vasopressors
might suggest a pursuit of “renal-preserving” or ino-
tropic effect.
Conclusions
Vasopressors and/or inotropes are almost invariably used
in the treatment of CS and were initiated soon after detec-
tion of shock. Adrenaline, used alone or in combination
with other vasoactive medication, was associated with
worsening of cardiac and renal injury and increased mor-
tality, raising questions about the safety of this treatment.
In turn, levosimendan in combination with noradrenaline,
was associated with a more positive outcome, and dobuta-
mine with noradrenaline appeared to be a prognostically
equal alternative; these combinations should be favored in
the early management of CS. Because our study does not
prove causality, our findings underscore the need for ran-
domized controlled trials of adrenaline versus noradren-
aline in CS.
Key messages
� Adrenaline use in cardiogenic shock is independently
associated with excess 90-day mortality
� Adrenaline use is associated with marked
aggravation of cardiac stress, myocardial injury and
kidney dysfunction
� Combined use of either dobutamine or levosimendan
with noradrenaline is prognostically similar
