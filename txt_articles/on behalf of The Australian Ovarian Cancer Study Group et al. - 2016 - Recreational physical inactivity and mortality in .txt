Background: Little is known about modifiable behaviours that may be associated with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) survival. We
conducted a pooled analysis of 12 studies from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium to investigate the association
between pre-diagnostic physical inactivity and mortality.
Methods: Participants included 6806 women with a primary diagnosis of invasive EOC. In accordance with the Physical Activity
Guidelines for Americans, women reporting no regular, weekly recreational physical activity were classified as inactive. We utilised
Cox proportional hazard models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) representing the associations
of inactivity with mortality censored at 5 years.
Results: In multivariate analysis, inactive women had significantly higher mortality risks, with (HR ¼ 1.34, 95% CI: 1.18–1.52) and
without (HR ¼ 1.22, 95% CI: 1.12–1.33) further adjustment for residual disease, respectively.
Conclusion: In this large pooled analysis, lack of recreational physical activity was associated with increased mortality among
women with invasive EOC.
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most deadly gynaecological
cancer in developed nations (Torre et al, 2015). Five-year survival
is approximately 46% in the United States and Europe (SEER,
2014; UK CR, 2015). Among women with invasive EOC, over 60%
are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease, with considerably
worse 5-year survival, ranging from 3 to 27% in the United States

 and the United Kingdom (SEER, 2014; UK CR, 2015). While
recent reports of improved long-term survival have been promising
(Akeson et al, 2009; Wright et al, 2015), most women diagnosed
with advanced-stage EOC will die from their disease, generally
within 5 years of diagnosis.
The most commonly cited prognostic factors associated with
invasive EOC survival are unmodifiable, and include disease stage
and grade at diagnosis, histology, and the extent of residual disease
remaining after tumour resection (Winter et al, 2007; Cress et al,
2015; Wright et al, 2015). While little is known about modifiable
behaviours that may be associated with EOC prognosis, the lack of
recreational physical activity, defined by the Physical Activity
Guidelines for Americans (PAGA) as engaging in no regular,
weekly, moderate-, or vigorous-intensity exercise during leisure
time (USDHHS, 2008), is a potentially modifiable behavioural
target for improving prognosis (Sanchis-Gomar et al, 2015; Li et al,
2016).
Worldwide, over 31% of adults are physically inactive, but
inactivity increases with age and is higher among women than men
(Hallal et al, 2012). As an exposure variable, inactivity can be
assessed with less misclassification than incremental categories of
physical activity (Bull et al, 2004; Celis-Morales et al, 2012).
Inactivity may also reflect physiological pathways that affect
carcinogenesis independently from pathways associated with
obesity or physical activity and skeletal muscle contraction
(Fiuza-Luces et al, 2013; Byers, 2014; Hildebrand et al, 2015;
Sanchis-Gomar et al, 2015). Few studies have systematically
evaluated the association between physical inactivity and ovarian
cancer prognosis. Thus, we chose to examine the association of
physical inactivity with subsequent mortality in women diagnosed
with invasive EOC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We conducted a pooled analysis utilising individual-level data from
12 studies in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC)
(Berchuck et al, 2008). Study protocols were approved by the
respective institutional review boards, and participants provided
written informed consent. The study population included 6806
women aged 18 years and older, with histologically confirmed
primary diagnoses of invasive EOC, fallopian tube cancer, or
primary peritoneal cancer.
Analysis variables. Mortality was assessed with time-to-event
analyses censored at 5 years. Thus, women were followed from the
date of diagnosis to the earliest of date of death, date of last follow-
up, or 5 years after the date of diagnosis. Available covariates
included a comprehensive set of epidemiological and clinical
variables from the OCAC core data set, which was collated,
reviewed, cleaned, and harmonised for use in OCAC pooled
analyses.
Physical activity was assessed using self- or interviewer-
administered questionnaires. Questionnaire format for assessing
physical activity habits varied between studies, but all question-
naires allowed for the identification of inactive women as defined
by the PAGA. Women reporting no regular moderate- to vigorous-
intensity recreational physical activities were categorised as
inactive, our exposure of interest. Questionnaires from nine
studies (AUS, CON, DOV, HAW, MAL, NEC, NJO, USC, and
HOP; Table 1) yielded data reflecting pre-diagnostic activity
spanning the course of adulthood, while questionnaires from three
studies (JPN, MAY, and MAC; Table 1) yielded data reflecting
activity at enrollment. To reduce the likelihood of reverse causation
as an explanation for observed associations, we conducted
sensitivity analyses excluding the three studies assessing inactivity
at enrollment.
Statistical
methods. Multivariable
Cox
proportional
hazards
models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) representing the association between
physical inactivity and mortality risk. We examined mortality
overall and according to subgroups by tumour histology, tumour
stage, menopausal status, and body mass index (BMI) classifica-
tion. We pre-specified age at diagnosis, tumour stage, and histology
as important adjustment variables; additional confounders were
identified utilising the 10% change-in-estimate guide (Maldonado
and Greenland, 1993). While the extent of residual disease after
surgical resection is a well-established prognostic factor for
invasive EOC, these data were only available in a subset of
participants (N ¼ 2473). Therefore, we estimated the association
between inactivity and mortality through two multivariable
models, with and without adjustment for residual disease. Finally,
between-study heterogeneity for the association between inactivity
and mortality was assessed by means of Q-statistics (Po0.05) and
I-squared statistics (o50%) (Higgins et al, 2003).
RESULTS
During the follow-up period, 2935 participants (43.1%) died. All
but one study (MAC) included herein were case–control studies
and nine studies originated in the United States (Table 1).
Participants were mostly white, post-menopausal women with
advanced-stage high-grade serous EOC. Collectively, 24.5% of
participants self-reported inactivity before diagnosis (Supplementary
Table S1).
For the association of inactivity with mortality, we observed no
significant heterogeneity between studies (Q-statistic P ¼ 0.21;
I-squared ¼ 23.7%), nor evidence of a site-by-inactivity interaction
(P ¼ 0.12). Therefore, we estimated pooled multivariable HRs and
95% CIs utilising a combined data set. Inactive women had
significantly greater risk of mortality (HR ¼ 1.22, 95% CI: 1.12–
1.33)
(Table
2);
the
association
remained
significant
with
adjustment for residual disease (HR ¼ 1.34, 95% CI: 1.18–1.52;
Table 3). Further control for smoking and BMI did not affect the
significant increased risk of mortality among inactive women with
(HR ¼ 1.35, 95% CI: 1.16–1.56) or without (HR ¼ 1.16, 95% CI:
1.05–1.27) adjustment for residual disease.
In subgroup analyses by histology, inactive women with high-
grade serous tumours had significantly higher mortality risks in
models without adjustment for residual disease (HR ¼ 1.21, 95%
CI: 1.11–1.33; Table 2). In models adjusted for residual disease,
inactive women with high-grade serous and clear cell tumours
had significantly greater mortality than their active counterparts:
HR ¼ 1.36 (95% CI: 1.17–1.58) and HR ¼ 1.73 (95% CI: 1.06–2.84),
respectively (Table 3). Because we were insufficiently powered to
detect
associations
among
the
more
infrequent
histological
subtypes, we also limited histology classifications to serous vs
non-serous disease. Here we observed consistent evidence of the
association between inactivity and mortality for both tumour types,
both
with
and
without
adjustment
for
residual
disease
(Supplementary Table S2).
In sensitivity analyses intended to reduce possible reverse
causation bias by exclusion of the three studies that assessed
inactivity only at enrollment, associations between inactivity and
mortality remained significant and were similar in magnitude to
the associations observed in our primary analysis: HR ¼ 1.28 (95%
CI: 1.09–1.49) and HR ¼ 1.19 (95% CI: 1.09–1.30) in models with
and without adjustment for residual disease, respectively. In
additional analyses excluding women who had died within 1 year
of diagnosis, the associations between inactivity and mortality
remained significant and of similar magnitude to those in primary
analyses in models both with (HR ¼ 1.27, 95% CI: 1.10–1.47) and

modification of the association between inactivity and mortality

(Supplementary

or

status
(Supplementary Table S5).
DISCUSSION
The current analyses of pooled individual-level data from OCAC
suggests that self-reported, habitual recreational physical inactivity
is an independent predictor of mortality among women diagnosed

Physical inactivity and ovarian cancer mortality

 with invasive EOC. The observed associations between inactivity
and mortality were consistently seen in sensitivity analyses
designed to reduce potential biases and were robust to adjustment
for relevant confounders and well-established prognostic factors.
Importantly, physical inactivity remained an independent pre-
dictor of mortality even among participants diagnosed with
advanced disease. If the association with pre-diagnostic activity
also applies to physical activity after ovarian cancer diagnosis,
it is possible that targeted intervention to reduce inactivity,
adjuvant to medical management, could improve survival in
women with EOC. This association needs confirmation by a large
randomised trial.
Several biological mechanisms have been proposed to account
for an association between physical inactivity and cancer develop-
ment, including increased adiposity, increased circulating sex
hormones, chronic inflammation, impaired immune surveillance,
impaired
insulin
regulation,
and
dysregulated
adipokines
(McTiernan, 2008). These same mechanisms could explain some
of the observed mortality risks associated with physical inactivity in
cancer survivors (Li et al, 2016). Further, obesity and physical
inactivity may affect carcinogenesis through independent pathways
(Byers, 2014; Hildebrand et al, 2015; Sanchis-Gomar et al, 2015).
Our finding of significantly increased mortality among inactive
women with diagnosed EOC supports this hypothesis. We

 observed no appreciable evidence that this association was
confounded or modified by BMI, supporting further investigation
of the role that physical inactivity may have in preventing EOC or
improving its survivability.
A strength of our study is that our analyses were conducted with
individual-level data from well-designed epidemiological investiga-
tions. Our ability to adjust for established prognostic factors
decreased the chance that the observed associations were explained
by confounding. Further, the observed associations remained
significant in sensitivity analyses designed to reduce sources of
bias. On the other hand, potential measurement error associated
with self-reported inactivity data categorised dichotomously is an
important limitation. However, using physical inactivity as the
exposure variable likely involves less exposure misclassification
than would occur with categorised incremental physical activity
exposures, and such misclassification would likely be non-
differential with respect to vital status, thus tending to bias
observed associations toward the null.
In summary, our findings add to a growing body of literature
suggesting that physical inactivity is associated with unfavourable
health outcomes, including poorer cancer outcomes. Given the
global
epidemic
of
physical
inactivity,
these
findings
have
important public health and clinical implications, particularly in
the context of a lack of modifiable prognostic factors for EOC, and
only modest improvements in survival among women diagnosed
with
EOC
in
recent
decades
(SEER,
2014).
Well-designed
prospective studies are needed to confirm the survival benefit
and to assess how much mortality can be reduced among women
diagnosed with invasive EOC.
