Abstract
Moderate pressure massage has contributed to many positive effects including increased weight 
gain in preterm infants, reduced pain in different syndromes including fibromyalgia and 
rheumatoid arthritis, enhanced attentiveness, reduced depression and enhanced immune function 
(increased natural killer cells and natural killer cell activity). Surprisingly, these recent studies 
have not been reviewed, highlighting the need for the current review. When moderate and light 
pressure massage have been compared in laboratory studies, moderate pressure massage reduced 
depression, anxiety and heart rate, and it altered EEG patterns, as in a relaxation response. 
Moderate pressure massage has also led to increased vagal activity and decreased cortisol levels. 
Functional magnetic resonance imaging data have suggested that moderate pressure massage was 
represented in several brain regions including the amygdala, the hypothalamus and the anterior 
cingulate cortex, all areas involved in stress and emotion regulation. Further research is needed to 
identify underlying neurophysiological and biochemical mechanisms associated with moderate 
pressure massage.

massage therapy research review
Massage therapy is one of the most effective and widely used alternative therapies. Although 
most massage therapy sessions are for pain, recent research suggests that it is effective for 
other conditions including growth of premature infants, ADHD, depression, and immune 
conditions, most especially cancer (see Field, Diego, &; Hernandez-Reif, 2007 for a 
review).1 In this paper recent data are reviewed on massage therapy effects and potential 
underlying mechanisms for those effects.
Although this review does not cover all conditions that have been positively affected by 
massage, it is focused on some specific conditions for the following reasons: 1)moderate 
versus light pressure data are reviewed inasmuch as moderate pressure is critical for

 achieving the positive effects of massage, findings that are important to communicate to 
therapists and clients alike; 2)preterm infant massage data are reviewed because of preterm 
infants’ need for supplemental stimulation such as massage therapy for optimal growth and 
development and the importance of conveying that to the medical community so that it can 
be adopted into practice; 3)pain syndromes are the most common presenting complaints to 
many complementary and alternative therapists such as massage therapists and to worker’s 
compensation; 4)attentiveness is critical for optimal school and job performance; 
5)depression has negative effects on the immune system; and 6)the reduction of cortisol by 
massage therapy leads to increased natural killer cells and natural killer cell activity. Natural 
killer cells, in turn, ward off viral, bacterial and cancer cells, and in that way enhance 
immune function and reduce illness and disease.
Preterm infants
Our first massage therapy study focused on weight gain in preterm infants.2 Since then, 
preterm infant massage has been noted to increase weight gain in studies from neonatal 
intensive care units in many parts of the world (see Field, Diego, &; Hernandez-Reif, 2010 
for a review).3 In most of these studies our 15-minute protocol of moderate pressure 
massage (moving the skin) was used twice per day for a one-week period. After we 
documented preterm infant weight gain following massage in several studies, we reported 
data showing increased vagal activity and gastric motility, which could be leading to more 
efficient food absorption and increased weight gain.4,5
In another study, we noted higher levels of insulin and IGF-1 growth factor when we 
compared a massage group who received three, 15-minute massages per day for five days to 
a control group who received standard nursery care without massage therapy.6The massage 
group had greater increases in: 1) weight gain; 2) serum levels of insulin; and 3) serum 
levels of IGF-1. Weight gain was correlated with insulin and IGF-1 levels. Path analyses 
suggested that increased vagal activity was associated with increased gastric motility, which, 
in turn, was related to greater weight gain, and increased IGF-1 was also related to greater 
weight gain. The increased vagal activity during the massage contributed to 49% of the 
variance in the increased gastric activity. And, the increased vagal activity during the 
massage explained 62% of the variance in the increase in insulin levels. These findings 
suggested two potential pathways by which massage can increase weight gain: 1) insulin 
release via the celiac branch of the vagus; and 2) increased gastric activity via the gastric 
branch of the vagus.7
Increased temperature is another potential underlying mechanism for the massage therapy 
effects on weight gain inasmuch as lower temperatures are associated with energy 
expenditure that could result in weight loss. Temperature was assessed in preterm neonates 
randomly assigned to a control or massage therapy group.8 Temperature increased more in 
the preterm neonates receiving massage, even though the incubator portholes were open 
during the 15-minute massage therapy sessions (which would be expected to lower their 
temperature). This likely resulted from the heat-producing effect of rubbing the skin.

 Another group explored reduced energy expenditure as a potential underlying mechanism in 
preterm neonates receiving massage.9This research team used the same massage therapy 
protocol as the one used in our preterm infant studies. Their metabolic measurements by 
direct calorimetry suggested that energy expenditure was significantly lower in the preterm 
infants after a five-day massage therapy period than after a period without massage. This 
decreased energy expenditure may be in part responsible for the increased weight gain 
associated with massage therapy.
Moderate pressure was a critical factor for the weight gain effect. This was documented in a 
study in which we directly compared moderate (moving the skin) versus light pressure (light 
stroking) massage.10 In that study, the moderate versus light pressure massage group gained 
more weight per day, and, as suggested, during behavior observations that followed the 
massage they showed significantly less: 1) active sleep; 2) fussing; 3) crying; 4) movement; 
and 5) stress behavior (hiccupping). They also had lower heart rate and greater vagal activity. 
All of these changes suggested lower arousal, which, in turn, could explain the enhanced 
immune function noted in preterm neonates following massage in a study on delayed-onset 
sepsis.11 In that study, mothers massaged their infants on the face and limbs as well as 
passively exercised their upper and lower limbs four times a day. The incidence of delayed-
onset sepsis was significantly lower in the massage group who also had a shorter hospital 
stay (by 7 days), which likely resulted from the lower incidence of sepsis. A potential 
pathway for the moderate pressure massage effects may be increased vagal activity, 
decreased cortisol, enhanced immune function and reduced sepsis. Inflated pro-
inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha should also be measured for their 
contribution to sepsis and their potential reduction by moderate pressure massage.
Several follow-up studies across infancy have revealed significant developmental benefits for 
massaged premies.12 Despite these positive effects of massage therapy on preterm infants, 
the incidence of preterm delivery would ideally be decreased. Inasmuch as there is a 
disproportionate incidence of preterm infants born to depressed women, massage was used 
as a prenatal intervention for those women in several studies. In at least 4 studies, massaging 
depressed pregnant women resulted in better neonatal outcomes (less prematurity and low 
birthweight).13-16 These effects likely derived from decreased levels of cortisol and 
norepinephrine resulting in lower intrauterine artery resistance. Inasmuch as the uterine 
artery carries oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, the constriction of the artery could lead to 
prematurity and lower birthweight.
Full-term infants also benefit from massage. In one study, for example, full-term newborns 
who received moderate versus light pressure massage from their mothers gained more 
weight and had better development over the first month of life.17 During the first several 
months, infants who are massaged have less irritability and sleep disturbance which are the 
most common complaints to pediatricians.1
Pain Syndromes
Massage has resulted in reduced pain in all the studies we have conducted on chronic pain 
conditions from lower back pain during pregnancy to labor pain, migraine headaches,

 premenstrual syndrome, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, carpal tunnel syndrome and 
rheumatoid arthritis.1 In most of these studies the moderate pressure massage was focused 
on the painful area, such as the lower back, and the 20-minute sessions were given twice per 
week for 5 weeks. In a recent review, the majority of the 25 studies that were covered 
employed a similar massage lasting 20-30 minutes and given twice-weekly over 5 weeks 
with assessments before and after the first and last session (at the end of the treatment 
period).18 These authors reported consistent single treatment reductions in salivary cortisol 
and heart rate and multiple treatment reduction in diastolic blood pressure (which has been 
recently replicated by Givi, 2013).19 Massage has also been effective for children and 
adolescents attending a chronic pediatric pain clinic.20 After the therapy sessions, the 
children and adolescents reported significantly lower levels of pain, discomfort and 
depressed mood. In a study on postoperative pain management in adults, back massages 
resulted in decreased pain intensity as well as lower anxiety levels.21
Arthritis patients have also experienced less pain following massage. For example, 
individuals with hand arthritis had less pain and greater grip strength following massage 
therapy22 and even less pain when applying a topical analgesic following the massages.23 
Similar data have been noted for carpal tunnel syndrome24 , which were recently replicated 
by two studies using the same massage and measurement protocol.25,26 Moderate versus 
light pressure massage has also been effective for rheumatoid arthritis in the upper limbs.27 
In that study entitled “Rheumatoid arthritis in upper limbs benefits from moderate pressure 
massage therapy” the adults with arthritis were randomly assigned to moderate or light 
pressure massage therapy groups. The participants were massaged on the wrists, arms and 
shoulders once a week for one month and they were also taught the massage and asked to 
massage themselves once a day. The moderate versus the light pressure massage therapy 
group had less pain and greater grip strength following the first and last massage sessions. 
By the end of the one – month massage period the moderate pressure versus the light 
pressure group had less pain, greater grip strength and greater range of motion in their 
wrists, elbows, and shoulders. Several studies on shoulder and/or neck pain, including one 
from our research institute, have yielded similar results.28-31 A meta-analysis on 12 studies 
on neck and shoulder pain showed immediate and short-term effects for massage therapy.32 
And headaches associated with neck pain have also been reduced by massage therapy, 
although spinal mobilization techniques were more effective in that study.33
Research on the lower limbs has focused on the knee. Massage outcomes have been positive 
for osteoarthritis of the knee34 in which a dose response curve was noted with a plateau at 60 
minutes per week. Pain has also been relieved by massage therapy following arthroscopic 
surgery for the knee in this case on a 20 minutes/week schedule.35
The positive effects of the massage therapy in some of these studies have been equivalent to 
active therapies including physical therapy. In a review of 9 systematic studies on the use of 
massage therapy for low back pain, for example, massage was more effective than 
placebo.36 However, conflicting findings were noted for studies that compared massage with 
other manual therapies such as mobilization and acupuncture.

 Massage has also been effective for both acute pain and mood in a study on cancer 
patients.37 In that research, adults with advanced cancer and moderate-to-severe pain who 
were enrolled in hospice received six 30-minute massages or simple-touch sessions for two 
weeks. Massage was more effective than simple-touch for immediate pain relief and mood 
shifts. Similar data have been reported for breast cancer patients.38 A review of 19 empirical 
studies and 8 review articles confirmed these data.39 According to these authors, 73% of 
cancer patients use massage therapy in the U.S. Some large cancer centers in the U.S. have 
integrated massage therapy into their programs based on the positive effects of massage on 
cancer pain.40 Other painful conditions have benefited from massage including burn 
wounds,41 post cardiac surgery pain,42-44 fibromyalgia,44,45 and Parkinsons.46 And, in a 
study on pain management in hospital inpatients from medical, surgical and obstetrics units, 
significant reductions in pain were reported (50% reduction on visual analog scales) 
accompanied by less sleep disturbance.47
Although most of the pain studies have been conducted on patients in hospitals or clinics, 
laboratory research has also been reported on the effects of massage on pain. For example, 
one group studied the effects of massage on mechanical pressure pain thresholds and 
perceived pain.48 The participants were assigned to a moderate pressure massage group, a 
superficial touch group or a no-treatment control group. Exercises were then performed to 
induce delayed onset muscle soreness. The moderate pressure massage group experienced 
decreased pain (by 48%) during the exercises.
Potential underlying mechanisms for moderate pressure massage reducing 
pain
The mechanism that has been most frequently used to explain massage therapy effects on 
pain syndromes is called The Gate Control Theory.1 According to that theory, pain is 
thought to stimulate shorter and less myelinated (insulated) nerve fibers so that the pain 
signal requires more time to reach the brain than pressure signals which are carried by nerve 
fibers that are more myelinated and longer and therefore able to transmit the pressure 
stimulus faster than the pain stimulus can be transmited. The pressure stimulus reaches the 
brain prior to the pain message and “closes the gate” to the pain stimulus. This metaphor has 
been used for the electrical and biochemical changes that are thought to occur following a 
pain stimulus. However, this theory has been controversial.49
Another theory relates pain to deep sleep deprivation. In deep sleep, less substance P is 
released and therefore less pain occurs because substance P causes pain. We tested the 
“enhanced deep sleep leads to less substance P” theory in our study on patients with 
fibromyalgia.50 Following a one -month period of massage therapy, more time was spent in 
deep sleep, and lower substance P levels were noted in saliva samples. Reputedly, lamina I 
of the superficial dorsal horn contains the main concentration of spinal substance P 
responsive neurons.51
Still another theory is that with increasing serotonin levels pain is decreased inasmuch as 
serotonin is the body’s natural anti-pain neurotransmitter.52 Serotonin levels are increased by 
massage therapy and are also correlated with decreased cortisol and depression, which are

 also important effects of massage therapy. And, serotonin is also related to decreased 
substance P. Further research is needed to test these models. Basic problems for hands-on 
therapy research like massage are the ethical problem of randomly assigning individuals to a 
no-treatment control group when a treatment is known to be effective as well as the inability 
to double-blind the studies.
Attentiveness and EEG patterns
Increased attentiveness has been noted in a laboratory study by our group following 15- 
minute chair massages.53EEG patterns of heightened alertness/attentiveness occurred 
following the massage sessions including increased beta and theta waves and decreased delta 
waves. These EEG patterns were related to better performance after the massage on math 
computations including performing the calculations in less time and with greater accuracy 
immediately after the massages.
The massage effects on attentiveness might be mediated by increased vagal activity. The 
vagus nerve branch to the heart slows heart rate.54 Increased vagal activity has been 
associated with enhanced attentiveness, and in several studies enhanced attentiveness has 
been associated with decreased heart rate.55 The stimulation of pressure receptors by 
moderate versus light pressure massage is associated with decreased heart rate and EEG 
patterns that, in turn, are related to enhanced attentiveness.56 Increased vagal activity may 
mediate the effects of moderate pressure stimulation on attentiveness. Enhanced 
attentiveness in children with autism and adolescents with ADHD following moderate 
pressure massage may also be mediated by increased vagal activity.1
EEG and other correlates
Depressed individuals often have greater right than left frontal lobe EEG activity57 Greater 
right frontal EEG activation is associated with negative emotions and with withdrawal or 
less approach behavior.57 Chronically depressed individuals show this EEG pattern even 
when they are no longer showing behavioral symptoms.57Thus, right frontal EEG has been 
noted as a physiological marker for chronic depression. Frontal EEG has shifted from right 
to left in depressed adolescents58 and adults even after a short session of moderate pressure 
massage.59 Other changes following massage therapy include increased vagal activity, that is 
typically low in depressed individuals.60The flat facial expressions and vocal intonation 
contour noted in depressed individuals could be explained by low vagal activity given that 
the vagus nerve stimulates the face and voice muscles.54
Cortisol levels that are often high in depression have decreased following moderate pressure 
massage60 as have neurotransmitters associated with stress, i.e. norepinephrine levels.61 
And, serotonin (the body’s natural antidepressant) and dopamine (an activating 
neurotransmitter) have increased following moderate pressure massage.52
Immune function
Children with cancer have benefited from moderate pressure massage.62 After four weekly 
massage sessions alternated with four weekly quiet-time control sessions, massage reduced

 heart rate and anxiety levels in the children, although immune function was only marginally 
improved in these children.
Natural killer cells and natural killer cell activity have increased following moderate 
pressure massage.1 These data are promising given that natural killer cells are noted to ward- 
off viral cells, bacterial cells and cancer cells .Natural killer cell activity has increased in 
preterm infants who received massage compared with sham therapy (light pressure massage 
control).6 Natural killer cells have also increased in children with HIV following massage.64 
Further, natural killer cells increased following a one-month period of moderate pressure 
massage for HIV- infected adolescents.65CD4 cells (the cells that are killed by the HIV 
virus) also increased in the adolescents, suggesting an improved clinical condition. Natural 
killer cells and natural killer cell cytotoxicity (activity) also increased in our studies on 
women with breast cancer.66,67 These women would also be expected to show clinical gains 
given that natural killer cells destroy cancer cells.68 Stimulation of pressure receptors, as in 
moderate pressure massage, increases vagal activity, which reduces cortisol levels and 
thereby saves immune cells inasmuch as cortisol kills immune cells.69 Other immune 
functions such as pro-inflammatory immune cells (cytokines) and shifts in immune balance 
are also involved. For example, in one study, massage therapy was given to young men after 
exercise-induced muscle damage.70 Massage attenuated the production of inflammatory 
cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-6). In a study on immune balance, an 
increase was noted in the Th1/Th2 ratio (a positive shift in immune balance) in breast cancer 
patients following 5 weeks of biweekly massages .71In another study assessing healthy 
individuals, salivary chromogranin A increased following back massage, which, as the 
authors suggested, could lead to enhanced immune function given that chromogranin A is 
noted for its antibacterial and antifungal activity.72
Moderate pressure appears to be necessary for these effects
Moderate pressure appears to be necessary for increased vagal activity and its effects.59,69 
That moderate pressure massage is more effective than light pressure massage suggests the 
involvement of pressure receptors. Animal studies indicate that stimulating pressure 
receptors activates the vagus nerve.73,74 These data are consistent with our findings that 
lower heart rate and EEG patterns of lower arousal were associated with moderate versus 
light pressure massage.56In this study, three different types of massage were assessed in a 
sample of adults who were randomly assigned to: (1) moderate pressure (moving the skin) 
massage, (2) light pressure (lightly stroking the skin) massage, or (3) vibratory stimulation 
(from a vibrating hand-held massage wand).56 Anxiety scores decreased for the 3 groups, 
but the moderate pressure massage group had the greatest decrease in anxiety, heart rate and 
EEG changes including increased delta and decreased alpha and beta activity, suggesting a 
relaxation response. The moderate pressure group also showed more positive affect and a 
shift toward left frontal EEG activation. The light pressure massage group, in contrast, had 
increased arousal, including increased heart rate and decreased delta and increased beta 
activity. The vibratory stimulation group also showed increased arousal, as indicated by 
increased heart rate and increased alpha and beta activity.

 In another study we conducted on different pressure massages, adults were randomly 
assigned to a moderate pressure or a light pressure massage group, and EKGs were 
recorded.69 Vagal activity increased for the moderate pressure massage group and decreased 
for the light pressure group. Another lab reported that following moderate pressure massage, 
oxytocin increased and ACTH (the precursor of the stress hormone cortisol) decreased.75 
For the massage group, the research team assessed 15 minutes of moderate pressure massage 
of the upper back. The control group rested quietly for 15 minutes. Comparisons of pre-post 
blood values suggested greater oxytocin levels and lower ACTH, nitric oxide and beta-
endorphin levels in the moderate pressure massage group.
Researchers have also quantified the changes in muscle activity that occurred after different 
pressure massages. Compared with light pressure massage, moderate pressure massage 
produced a greater reduction in the stretch reflex.76 As the author suggested, the fact that the 
stretch reflex is reduced by moderate pressure massage suggests that it may produce some of 
its beneficial effects by “reducing excitability in alpha motor neurons”. A reduction in the 
stretch reflex would be desirable because spinal hyperexcitability is associated with chronic 
pain syndromes.76
Moderate pressure massage increases vagal activity and decreases cortiso
The model we have been exploring for the massage effectsnc is that moderate pressure (as in 
stimulation of pressure receptors under the skin) enhances vagal activity which, in turn, 
reduces cortisol leading to many effects including reduced pain and increased immune 
function. Vagal activity consistently increases following moderate pressure massage.4,56 
This may have occurred via stimulation of pressure receptors, which ultimately signal the 
limbic system including hypothalamic structures involved in cortisol secretion.
Anatomical studies suggest that baroreceptors, and to a lesser extent, mechanoreceptors 
within and beneath the skin (i.e. Pacinian corpuscles) transmit signals to the vagus (to the 
nucleus ambiguous and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus).77 Research also suggests that 
electrical vagal stimulation reduces cortisol levels in depressed individuals.78 Also, as 
already noted, we have shown that moderate pressure massage (but not light pressure 
massage) increased vagal activity in both infants and adults.69 Data from many studies 
confirm that massage therapy decreases heart rate,56 lowers blood pressure, 79-81and reduces 
cortisol levels.82 And data from an fMRI study showed that following moderate pressure 
massage cerebral blood flow increased in several brain regions involved in depression and 
stress regulation including the amygdala and the hypothalamus.83 These fMRI data suggest 
that moderate pressure massage involves hypothalamic regulation of autonomic nervous 
system activity, cortisol secretion and limbic activity associated with emotion regulation. 
Another group that has used functional magnetic resonance imaging noted that moderate 
pressure massage was represented in the anterior cingulate cortex.84 They assessed four 
different touch conditions including human touch with or without movement and a rubber 
glove with or without movement. The force and velocity were held constant across 
conditions. Human touch was rated as most pleasant, particularly when combined with 
movement. The fMRI results suggested that human touch with movement most strongly

 activated the anterior cingulate cortex. The authors suggested that these data were consistent 
with findings on other rewarding pleasant touch.
Increased vagal activity is associated with lower heart rate and blood pressure as well as 
decreased cortisol levels.54 Inversely, decreased vagal activity has been associated with 
increased cortisol levels.85 Others have noted an inhibitory effect of vagal activity on 
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal function.86 The decreased norepinephrine and increased 
serotonin levels we have noted following massage might also be mediated by increased 
vagal activity.52,87 Further research is needed on the interactive effects of these biochemical 
changes.
Summary
Moderate pressure massage has increased weight gain in preterm infants, reduced pain in 
different syndromes including fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis, enhanced attentiveness, 
reduced depression and improved immune function (increased natural killer cells and natural 
killer cell activity). When moderate and light pressure massage have been compared, 
moderate pressure massage reduced depression, anxiety and heart rate, altered EEG patterns 
and increased vagal activity, as in a relaxation response. Increased vagal activity has also 
been associated with decreased cortisol following massage. Functional magnetic resonance 
imaging data have suggested that moderate pressure massage was represented in several 
brain regions including the amygdala, the hypothalamus and the anterior cingulate cortex, all 
areas involved in stress and emotion regulation.
Further research is needed to identify underlying neurophysiological and biochemical 
mechanisms associated with moderate pressure massage. Unfortunately, several 
methodological challenges compromise this research including finding suitable control 
groups, e.g. controls for touching, inasmuch as light pressure massage can be aversive. 
Double blinding is also impossible. Further, replication studies are limited given the expense 
of biochemical and neurophysiological measures and the limited research funding for 
alternative therapy studies once their positive effects have been documented. Thus, the need 
for further massage therapy research and studies on similar therapies is highlighted by this 
literature review.
