Abstract
Background: Eating disorders (EDs) are common amongst women; however, no research has specifically investigated
the lifetime/12-month prevalence of eating disorders amongst women in mid-life (i.e., fourth and fifth decade of life)
and the relevant longitudinal risk factors. We aimed to investigate the lifetime and 12-month prevalence of EDs and
lifetime health service use and to identify childhood, parenting, and personality risk factors.
Methods: This is a two-phase prevalence study, nested within an existing longitudinal community-based sample of
women in mid-life. A total of 5658 women from the UK Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC;
enrolled 20 years earlier) participated. ED diagnoses were obtained using validated structured interviews. Weighted
analyses were carried out accounting for the two-phase methodology to obtain prevalence figures and to carry out
risk factor regression analyses.
Results: By mid-life, 15.3% (95% confidence intervals, 13.5–17.4%) of women had met criteria for a lifetime ED. The
12-month prevalence of EDs was 3.6%. Childhood sexual abuse was prospectively associated with all binge/purge
type disorders and an external locus of control was associated with binge-eating disorder. Better maternal care was
protective for bulimia nervosa. Childhood life events and interpersonal sensitivity were associated with all EDs.
Conclusions: By mid-life a significant proportion of women will experience an ED, and few women accessed
healthcare. Active EDs are common in mid-life, both due to new onset and chronic disorders. Increased awareness of
the full spectrum of EDs in this stage of life and adequate service provision is important. This is the first study to
investigate childhood and personality risk factors for full threshold and sub-threshold EDs and to identify common
predictors for full and sub-threshold EDs. Further research should clarify the role of preventable risk factors on both
full and sub-threshold EDs.

 Background
Eating disorders (EDs) are severe psychiatric disorders
associated with high levels of morbidity [1], mortality
[2, 3], and social, psychological and physical impair-
ment [4]. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for
Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5) [5] recently
broadened ED diagnostic criteria, aiming to reduce the
number of individuals with an ED who do not fit full-
threshold diagnostic categories. Binge-eating disorder
(BED) was introduced as a diagnostic category, and the
criteria for anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa
(BN) were broadened. Although previously considered
low prevalence disorders, this broadening of the diag-
nostic criteria in DSM-5 has yielded preliminary evi-
dence that ED are more common than once thought. A
small number of community-based studies have investi-
gated the prevalence of DSM-5 EDs. Lifetime preva-
lence estimates of DSM-5 EDs have varied dramatically
across studies [6, 7] and the same applies to period-
prevalence estimates [8, 9]. The remarkable variability
across studies is likely due to sample size, differences in
study design (questionnaire only assessment vs. two-
phase studies), and a focus on adolescents/young adults
only (reflecting the peak age of onset of AN and BN),
thus highlighting a need for further large studies. No
previous studies have investigated the period or lifetime
prevalence of EDs amongst women in the fourth and
fifth decade of life, after most individuals would be
considered to have passed through the primary window
of risk. We recently highlighted a wide gap in access to
healthcare amongst adults with ED in a UK population-
based sample [8], and we therefore sought to replicate
and extend our findings.
A long-term perspective offers the unique opportun-
ity to investigate EDs and relevant precursors/risk
factors using a disease life-course approach. Few stud-
ies have investigated risk factors for EDs using a longi-
tudinal prospective design [10], and the majority have
focused on treatment seeking samples and full thresh-
old EDs. Prior evidence from our group [11, 12] and
others [13, 14] points to childhood experiences and
personality as important risk factors for EDs; however,
there is a relative lack of population-based studies
investigating these in relation to ED. Thus, our aims
were (1) to determine the lifetime and 12-month
prevalence of DSM-5 EDs in mid-life in women from a
population-based cohort using a two-phase design and
to explore healthcare access, as well as (2) to investi-
gate associations between lifetime ED, risk factors
(personality characteristics (personality, locus of con-
trol); early childhood experiences (sexual abuse, ma-
ternal care, carer/parent death, parental separation/
divorce and being under local authority care)) and
fixed factors (intelligence quotient (IQ)).
Methods
Sample
The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children
(ALSPAC) is a population-based, extensive prospective
study of women and their children, investigating the
effects of environment, genetic and other factors on
child health and development [15]. All pregnant women
living in the geographical area of Avon, UK, who were
expected to deliver their baby between April 1, 1991,
and December 31, 1992, were invited to take part in the
study. Uptake was high and those enrolled represented
approximately 85% of the eligible population. ALSPAC
recruited 14,541 pregnant women; all women gave in-
formed and written consent. The study website contains
details of all the data that is available through a fully
searchable data dictionary: http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/
researchers/data-access/data-dictionary/.
Procedures and measures
Data collection was carried out in two phases between
2009 and 2012. Figure 1 presents the study participation
flowchart.
Phase 1
A total of 9233 women who were still alive, enrolled in the
study and participating in assessment waves, and were
main carers for their ALSPAC child, were enrolled and
sent a version of the Eating Disorders Diagnostic Schedule
(EDDS) adapted to cover the whole lifespan [16]. Women
were invited to complete the questionnaire either online
or on paper. Screen positive and a similar percentage of
screen negative (~10%) women were selected for interview,
based on sample size calculations. Criteria for screening
positive were based on a previous study and identified
diagnostic cut-offs [16].
Phase 2
Women who screened positive and a subset of those who
screened negative were interviewed using the ED section
of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR disor-
ders (SCID-I) (with no skip rules) [17], supplemented with
a version of the LIFE interview [18], adapted to EDs [19],
aimed at investigating presence, frequency, and duration
of ED behaviors (restriction, fasting, excessive exercise,
binge eating, and purging), as well as body mass index
(BMI) over the lifetime. Women were asked to anchor
their responses using major life events, such as the birth
of their study child, in order to increase accuracy of
reporting and minimize reporting bias. Each ED behavior
was recorded over the lifetime from its first occurrence to
time of the interview. Diagnoses were obtained supple-
menting the information for the SCID-I with detailed
information from the LIFE to obtain DSM-5 diagnoses for
disorders (e.g., BN and BED) reflecting different frequency

 thresholds in DSM-IV and DSM-5. Questions about ac-
cess to healthcare and treatment for ED were specifically
devised for the purpose of this study; if women reported
any ED behaviors or cognitions they were asked if they
had ever sought and/or received treatment for these.
If they replied yes they were then asked to describe
what kind of treatment they had received (inpatient,
outpatient, psychological treatment, medication or
other); they were also asked if they had received
treatment for other psychiatric disorders.
Training and quality control
Interviews were carried out by three trained interviewers
(all psychologists). All interviewers practiced the interview
amongst themselves and with colleagues, and conducted
interviews under supervision prior to interviewing study
subjects, including rating available interviews. Interviewers
attended a monthly meeting with the first author, where
interviews of symptomatic individuals were discussed.
All diagnoses were reviewed and confirmed by the first
author. A subset of interviews were recorded for inter-
rater reliability purposes. Interviewers demonstrated
excellent inter-rater reliability on the SCID with 100%
agreement; the intraclass correlation coefficient for
diagnosis was 1.00.
Diagnostic properties of the EDDS
The adapted EDDS had a sensitivity of 97.3% (95% CI,
94.9–98.8%) and specificity of 74.6% (71.1–77.8%), and
positive and negative predictive values of 65.1% and
98.3%, respectively. False negatives were therefore rare,
whilst false positives were more common.
ED diagnoses
Diagnoses of DSM-5 ED (AN, BN, BED, sub-threshold
BN and BED, purging disorder (PD), and other specified
feeding and eating disorder (OSFED)) were obtained
using the SCID supplemented with behavioral data
(including frequency and duration of each symptom)
from the LIFE. ED diagnoses were derived as shown in
Additional file 1: Table S1. Given the age of our sample
and the diagnostic instruments used, we were unable to
ascertain the prevalence of avoidant/restrictive food in-
take disorder, pica, or rumination.
Risk factors
Data on relevant predictors were obtained as part of
routine ALSPAC data collections approximately 20 years
prior to the current study.
Obtained during pregnancy (12, 18, 32 weeks gestation)
Childhood unhappiness
Ascertained using women’s rating of their happiness in
childhood (up to 16 years). We derived a binary variable
(very unhappy, quite unhappy, and not really happy vs.
moderately happy, very happy).

 Parental divorce or separation, adoption or being under
health authority care, death of a carer
Assessed by asking women whether their parents
had divorced or separated prior to their 18th birth-
day; whether they had been legally adopted or had
been placed under local authority care (foster care
and or group homes); and whether a parent or per-
son who cared for them had died prior to their 17th
birthday. These variables were retained as dichotomous
(yes or no).
Early sexual abuse
Assessed using a questionnaire about early sexual expe-
riences covering a range of sexual experiences (including
noncontact exposure, fondling, oral sex, and sexual
intercourse) involving boy/girlfriends, parents, other rel-
atives, family friends, and strangers. Experiences involv-
ing physical sexual contact with an individual other than
a boy/girlfriend prior to age 16 were defined as sexual
abuse. A dichotomous variable (childhood sexual abuse
vs. none) was generated.
Life events
Data on life events experienced up to age 17 were
obtained from a questionnaire completed during preg-
nancy, containing a life-event inventory (indicating oc-
currence of the event), with five response categories for
each event (indicating the extent to which the re-
spondent was affected) based on Brown & Harris’s
work [20, 21]. In order to take into account both the
wide variation of life events severity and their impact
ratings, life events were weighted to create a continu-
ous score as previously reported [22].
Bonding with parents
Assessed using the Parental Bonding Instrument [23].
Two scores were derived, (1) parental over-protection
(degree to which women felt that their own parents had
been over-protective and failed to allow them to make
their choices in childhood – higher scores indicate a
more oppressive relationship) and (2) maternal care
(measured the woman’s perception of the relationship
she had with her own mother – higher scores indi-
cate a warmer relationship). We categorized the latter
according to the top and bottom quartile, with the
interquartile scores being the referent, to determine
whether a warm relationship (top quartile) would be
protective and a poor relationship (bottom quartile)
would be risk-conferring for EDs.
Locus of control (LOC)
Assessed with a shortened version of the Adult Nowicki-
Strickland Internal/External Locus of Control Scale [24],
measuring external (higher scores) versus internal LOC.
Interpersonal sensitivity
Measured using the Interpersonal Sensitivity Measure
[25] a valid and reliable measure assessing sensitivity to
interpersonal and social feedback, and interpersonal
avoidance [26].
Fixed factor
General intelligence
Measured using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of
Intelligence [27] 15–16 years after enrolment in the
study on 2165 women. We used the total IQ score.
Covariates
Maternal age was obtained during Phase 1; women’s eth-
nicity and educational status were obtained combining
data provided at various time-points between enrolment
and child age 18 [28].
Statistical analyses
All analyses were carried out using STATA 13 [29].
Prevalence
Prevalence estimates were calculated allowing for the
two-phase sampling procedure by using weights [30, 31].
A sampling weight was generated using information
from Phase 1 and the Phase 2 sampling strategy as
described by Dunn et al. [29]. The sampling weight indi-
cates how many Phase 1 participants each participant in
Phase 2 represents. The weighted prevalence estimates
of ED diagnoses from diagnostic interviews in Phase 2
were weighted back to the sample that participated to
Phase 1. The survey (svy) set of commands was used in
STATA to obtain prevalence estimates and carry out
regression analyses, as they allow for stratified sam-
pling and provide robust estimation of 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs).
Risk factors analyses
Analyses were adjusted for the a priori confounders of
maternal
age,
ethnicity
and
education.
Given
high
diagnostic crossover [32], women were categorized into
mutually exclusive diagnostic groups. Women who only
met one diagnosis were assigned to that diagnostic
group; for those who had more than one diagnosis over
their lifetime a hierarchical approach was used: full
diagnoses (AN, BN, BED) trumped OSFED subtypes,
BED trumped BN, and BN trumped AN, in accordance
to our and others’ previous studies [19, 33], and
evidence that diagnostic crossover over the lifetime in
ED and in this sample occurs most commonly from re-
strictive type disorders (anorexia nervosa – restrictive
(AN-R)) to binge and/or binge-purge disorders [19, 32].
Sensitivity analyses were carried out by removing from
the analytic sample women who met criteria for more
Micali et al. BMC Medicine  (2017) 15:12 
Page 4 of 10
 than one ED and assessing differences in association
estimates with hypothesized risk factors. Women with
complete data on exposures and outcomes were in-
cluded in these analyses. Missing data on covariates (1%)
were imputed using multiple imputation by chained
equation performed in STATA 13. Imputation models
included all variables in the analyses and predictors of
missingness. Results obtained after imputation were
similar to those found using complete case analyses;
therefore, we report results from multiple imputation.
All tests were two tailed and a P value of 0.05 was
used as a cut-off for statistical significance.
Results
Phase 1
Amongst women who were sent a questionnaire, 5655
(61.3%)
returned
completed
questionnaires
and
826
(14.88%) were screen positive. Amongst 4832 screen nega-
tive women, 698 (12%) were randomly selected for inter-
view in Phase 2. Characteristics of participants in Phase 1
are shown in Additional file 1: Table S2; women who
participated were more likely to have received secondary
education and less likely to have had prior pregnancies.
The prevalence of self-reported ED at enrolment (in
pregnancy) did not differ. The average age of women who
participated in the study was 47.78 years (SD: 4.5).
Phase 2
Amongst the 1524 women selected for interview, 1043
(68.4%) consented to participate in Phase 2 and were
interviewed. Of those not interviewed, 10 were, at the
time of interview, considered ineligible for participation
by the ALSPAC study team (i.e., experiencing major life
difficulties of a kind that made participation not possible
such as bereavement and severe physical illness in the
family), 29 (1.9%) declined participation and 442 (29.1%)
were not contactable. One woman withdrew consent for
participation in ALSPAC following interview, she was
therefore excluded from all analyses. Interview data were
therefore available for 1042 women.
Women who were interviewed within each stratum
(screen positive or negative) did not differ on socio-
demographic (parity, pre-pregnancy BMI, age, education)
and screening (weight and shape concern, binge-eating,
compensatory behaviors) characteristics from those not
interviewed.
Prevalence of ED
Table 1 presents the lifetime and 12-month weighted
prevalence of ED. The weighted lifetime prevalence of ED
was 15.33% (95% CI, 13.48–17.42%) and the 12-month
prevalence was 3.61% (3.00–4.35%). Amongst full thresh-
old disorders, DSM-5 AN was the most common lifetime
ED (3.64%). OSFED was highly prevalent, affecting 7.64%
of women in their lifetime. EDs were common in the
12 months prior to assessment (weighted prevalence:
3.61%); BED was the most common full-threshold dis-
order (1.03%). New onset EDs represented 41.6% of 12-
month prevalent diagnoses.
Median age of onset for the first ED diagnosis was
lowest for AN-R (16, range 11–39) and highest for sub-
threshold BED (26, range 13–44). The majority of
women (76.3%) reported the onset of their ED to be
prior to the birth of the index child. Only 27.4% of all
women with EDs had sought help or received treatment
for an ED at any point in their life. The most common
healthcare service use was having seen a general practi-
tioner (8.2%); 4 (1.2%) women reported having seen a
psychiatrist for their ED and 4 (1.2%) having received
inpatient treatment; 16 (4.9%) women reported having
received individual psychological treatment for their ED;
and 13 (4.0%) reported having received psychological
treatment for another disorder.
Risk factors
Amongst early risk factors, differences emerged across
EDs. Having experienced death of a carer was associated
with seven-fold increased odds for PD. Parental separation
or divorce in childhood was associated with increased
odds for BN, BED, and atypical AN. Child sexual abuse
was associated with all disorders with binge-eating behav-
iors (anorexia nervosa binge-purge (AN-BP), BN, BED,
and sub-threshold BN and BED) (Table 2). Sexual abuse
perpetrated by a non-stranger was two-fold more preva-
lent amongst women with AN-BP, but as prevalent as
sexual abuse by a stranger for BN and BED.
Childhood unhappiness was associated with higher
odds of AN-R, BN, BED, and PD. Childhood life events
were positively associated with all ED (apart from other
OSFED), with a 4–10% increased odds per unit score
increase (Table 2). Reporting low maternal warmth (low-
est quartile) was also associated with increased odds for
BN, BED, and sub-threshold BED and PD. In contrast,
women reporting high maternal warmth (top quartile)
had 20% decreased odds of developing BN compared to
those in the lowest 75% range. Women who reported a
more oppressive relationship with parents had higher
odds of AN-BP, BED, sub-threshold BN, atypical AN,
and PD (Table 2). Amongst personality characteristics, a
more external LOC was positively associated with BED,
with a 19% increase in odds per one-point score in-
crease. Higher levels of interpersonal sensitivity were
positively associated with all EDs (apart from other
OSFED and PD) (Table 2).
A marginal association was identified between higher
total IQ and lifetime AN-BP, with a one-point increase
in total IQ increasing the odds of AN-BP by 4% (OR = 1.04,
95% CI, 1.01–1.07).

 Sensitivity analyses showed that, when analyses were
restricted to women who had not transitioned to a dif-
ferent ED, the identified associations with risk factors
did not change in magnitude or significance apart from
the associations between maternal care and BN and BED
becoming smaller and non-significant. Sensitivity ana-
lyses stratifying according to whether the ED disorder
had onset before birth of the index child or after showed
no differences in magnitude of associations apart from a
smaller association between life events and AN-BP.
Discussion
In this large sample of UK women in mid-life DSM-5
EDs were common. The lifetime prevalence of DSM-5
AN was higher than previously reported for DSM-IV
AN but comparable to prior estimates of ‘broad’ DSM-
IV AN [34] and expected given the removal of the amen-
orrhea criterion in DSM-5 [34], and the older age of our
sample. The lifetime prevalence of BN and BED were
also in line with previous community studies [35],
although surprisingly, BED was less common during
lifetime compared to AN and BN. This might be due to
a higher percentage of highly educated women par-
ticipating in Phase 1, and the ethnic composition of
ALSPAC [15]. EDs other than AN, BN, and BED, now
subsumed under OSFED, were common in this sample
(7.6%), in particular the residual unspecified category
(other OSFED). This suggests that, despite efforts in
DSM-5 to reduce the prevalence of the ‘unspecified’
category (a goal of the revisions to DSM-IV), as previ-
ously shown [4, 6, 9], many individuals in the commu-
nity experience EDs other than AN, BN, and BED. The
relatively large subset of women presenting with ‘other
OSFED’ (27.6% of all OSFED) is in line with our own
[4] and others’ research [36].
EDs in the year prior to interview were more common
than expected, no previous study – to our knowledge – has
investigated the period prevalence of DSM-5 ED in a com-
munity sample in mid-life. OSFED was the most common
ED, accounting for almost half of all prevalent ED cases
and BED was the most common full-threshold disorder.
These findings highlight, for the first time, that EDs are not
confined to earlier decades of life and that both chronic
and new onset disorders are apparent in this stage of life.
Although our data cover a wide time lag (last 40 years)
and might therefore reflect past rather than current lack of
identification of EDs and related healthcare provision in the
UK, it is nevertheless surprising that, across their lifetime,
very few women had sought or received treatment for EDs.
Our investigation of risk factors of lifetime EDs revealed
important findings. Childhood sexual abuse, unhappiness,
and low parental care were associated with binge and/or
purge-type ED (AN-BP, full and sub-threshold BN and
BED). The association between childhood sexual abuse and
binge and/or purge-type ED is consistent with previous
retrospective studies [14, 37, 38], and extends this evidence
to sub-threshold ED. In line with our recent meta-analysis
[11] and previous hypotheses that parenting risk factors
and parental influences might act differently across the ED
diagnostic spectrum [14], parental overprotection and low
maternal care were associated with binge and/or purge
disorders, but not AN. We recently showed that retrospect-
ively reported parental influences (including poor parent-
ing and overprotection) predicted body dissatisfaction
in women with BN and AN-BP but not AN-R [39].
This
association
with
binge/purge
type
disorders
maybe mediated via negative affect, low self-esteem,
or body dissatisfaction developmentally, as might be the
case with sexual abuse. Further longitudinal studies are
required to empirically test these pathways.

 High interpersonal sensitivity was associated with all
EDs. Interpersonal sensitivity has been described as
sensitivity to other’s feedback and fear of social rejection
[26], and it is characterized by misinterpretation of
interpersonal
behaviors,
interpersonal
avoidance
and
discomfort in the presence of others due to a sense of in-
adequacy. Our finding confirms and strengthens existing
cross-sectional evidence that social impairment and inter-
personal difficulties are common across EDs [11], and
might contribute to their onset and maintenance [11, 40].
We replicated associations identified in clinical studies
between high IQ and AN [41, 42], in a community
setting (women with lifetime AN-BP had a total IQ on
average 5 points higher than women with no EDs).
Whether the higher IQ observed is secondary to higher
levels of perfectionism, or indeed indexes specific cogni-
tive strengths requires further study and elucidation.
This study is the first to investigate childhood risk
factors for PD, a newly described ED. The only twin study
of PD recently showed that non-shared environmental
factors explained 56% of the variance for PD [43]; how-
ever, the study could not disentangle the effect of non-
shared environment versus genetic factors. Our findings
suggest a role for childhood experiences and parenting as
risk factors for PD. Similarly, this is the first study to in-
vestigate risk factors for atypical AN, with initial evidence
of a risk factor profile more similar to binge/purge type
ED than AN-R. This is the first study to show a similar
pattern of risk for full threshold and sub-threshold BN
and BED. These findings, together with evidence of similar
outcomes between threshold and sub-threshold BN and
BED [4], confirm similarities between full and sub-
threshold ED, in this case in relation to risk factors.
Few associations were identified between environmen-
tal risk variables and restrictive AN. This finding might
reflect our hierarchical approach to lifetime diagnosis, in
that to be included in this group, women had to have
met criteria for AN-R only (and not other EDs). As such,
our findings point to a smaller contribution of environ-
mental risk to this phenotype [34].
Strengths of the study include a large community
sample of women, overcoming bias introduced by
studying treatment-seeking individuals. The two-phase
epidemiological design, one of the best approaches to
estimate prevalence of disease [44], and the survey
analytical techniques allowed more accurate estimates
to be obtained using our entire Phase I sample. We
used a validated and reliable assessment for EDs and
supplemented this with a longitudinal assessment of
lifetime symptoms to obtain DSM-5 diagnoses. The
availability of risk factor data independently collected
20 years prior to the current study allowed a less
biased estimation of risk factors, although recall bias
might explain some of our findings.
Limitations of the study include the nature of the
ALSPAC cohort, i.e. women who were pregnant at a
specific point in time in a defined geographic area. The
sample is therefore likely to include women with ED
who were able to become pregnant at least once and is
therefore not representative of the general population.
Nevertheless, the lowest ever self-reported BMI in this
sample was 10.7, and the lowest measured BMI at mean
age 48 years was 15.4, suggesting a range of ED severity
within the sample. Participation in Phase 1 was selective;
however, we were able to determine that more educated
women and those with fewer children participated.
Despite attrition between Phase 1 and 2, our analytical
approach allows minimizing bias due to attrition. More-
over, risk factor analyses were controlled for socio-
demographic factors associated with non-participation in
Phase 1, therefore increasing generalizability of the find-
ings. It is possible that women with higher levels of
psychopathology were less represented in this study;
however, levels of self-reported EDs at enrolment were
comparable across participants and non-participants,
therefore we are unlikely to have underestimated the
prevalence of EDs. Small sample size in some diagnos-
tic groups might account for false negatives. Similarly,
chance might explain some of our positive findings.
We could not directly investigate other psychiatric dis-
orders and, therefore, the specificity of risk factors for
ED versus other psychopathology needs elucidating
further.
Conclusions
EDs are common across the lifespan and in mid-life. Poor
healthcare access was evident in this sample of women.
This has implications for service provision, which at present
is not specifically geared towards women in mid-life, and in
identification of women who might be misdiagnosed given
the lack of awareness amongst healthcare professionals of
ED presentations. Although some risk factors differed
across ED subtypes, childhood sexual abuse and poor par-
enting were associated with binge/purge type disorders,
whilst personality factors were more broadly associated
with several diagnostic categories. Few risk factors were
specifically associated with one diagnostic category. These
patterns suggest shared environmental risk across the ED
diagnostic spectrum, independent of full/sub-threshold
symptoms. The evidence that lifetime and active EDs are
common amongst women in mid-life, compounded by the
lack of healthcare access and treatment, highlights the like-
lihood of high disease burden and unmet needs. Future
studies should also aim to better characterize EDs in mid-
life, and clarify their correlates in terms of physical and
psychiatric comorbidities, as well as differences in precipi-
tating factors leading to ‘late onset’ compared to adoles-
cent/young adult onset.
