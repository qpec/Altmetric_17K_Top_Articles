Implanted brain electrodes construct the only means to electrically interface with individual neurons in vivo, but
their recording efficacy and biocompatibility pose limitations on scientific and clinical applications. We showed
that nanoelectronic thread (NET) electrodes with subcellular dimensions, ultraflexibility, and cellular surgical
footprints form reliable, glial scar–free neural integration. We demonstrated that NET electrodes reliably de-
tected and tracked individual units for months; their impedance, noise level, single-unit recording yield, and
the signal amplitude remained stable during long-term implantation. In vivo two-photon imaging and postmor-
tem histological analysis revealed seamless, subcellular integration of NET probes with the local cellular and
vasculature networks, featuring fully recovered capillaries with an intact blood-brain barrier and complete ab-
sence of chronic neuronal degradation and glial scar.
INTRODUCTION
Chronically implanted electrodes (1–4) enable one of the most impor-
tant neurotechniques by allowing for the acquisition of individual neu-
ron electrical activities in the living brain (5–7). Although long-term
electrical recording was sometimes observed (2, 8), large variations in
chronic recording capacity were often reported (3, 4), largely due to
the lack of stability at the interface between conventional electrodes
and the brain tissue (4, 9) in both the short and the long term.
Conventional neural implants have volumes and surgical footprints
considerably larger than those of cells and capillaries, which induce
substantial damage and disruption to local cellular and vascular net-
works (10). Moreover, these probes are significantly more rigid than
the host brain tissue, whose natural micromovements induce intense
stress at the interface (11). In the short term, the resulting electrode
displacement from their targeted neurons leads to sudden waveform
changes in time scales as short as hours that prevent reliable tracking
of individual neurons over days and longer (12, 13). In the long term,
the presence of implants causes recurring cellular and vascular dam-
age, elicits sustained inflammation and tissue response (14), and even-
tually leads to neuronal degradation and glial scar formation near the
implants (10, 15, 16). These chronic deteriorations are manifested in
electrical recordings as degradations in recording fidelity, including
increasing impedance, elevated noise levels, decreasing signal ampli-
tudes, and diminishing unit recordings (1–4, 16).
Extensive research efforts in the past decade have demonstrated that
reducing the neural probe dimension (17) and rigidity (16, 18, 19)
improves neural interface. Recent work has shown that macroporous
electronics (20) and ultrasmall microelectrodes made of carbon fibers
(21, 22) greatly reduced tissue response. However, reliable brain probes
that detect and track activities from the same neurons for extended
periods with none of the aforementioned chronically detrimental effects
require seamless biointegration but are yet to be demonstrated.
Taking previous efforts in improving the neural electrode interface
into consideration, we identified the following key aspects for estab-
lishing a reliable and glial scar–free neural-probe interface: (i) the
dimension of the probe is comparable to or smaller than that of av-
erage cells and capillaries, such that its perturbation to the host
biological matrix is minimal (10, 17); (ii) the probe has sufficient flex-
ibility to ensure complete compliance to tissue micromovements and
to reduce probe-tissue interfacial force to the range of cellular force
(nanonewtons) (20, 23); (iii) the surgical damage during implantation
is less than ca. 100 mm across to allow for tissue recovery (24, 25); and
(iv) the probe is mechanically and electrically robust for long-term
functionality under physiological conditions. To meet these stringent
requirements, we developed ultraflexible nanoelectronic thread (NET)
brain probes and an implantation strategy with cellular-sized surgical
footprints. We verified the effectiveness of our approach in a rodent
(mouse) model by chronic electrical recording and comprehensive
characterizations of the probe-tissue interface.
RESULTS
We designed and fabricated two types of NET brain probes, NET-50
and NET-10, using a multilayer, substrate-less architecture and
specialized photolithography (Materials and Methods). As shown in
Fig. 1, NET-50 had a four-layer layout with a total thickness of
1 mm and an average width of 50 mm, hosting a linear array of eight
electrodes. NET-10 featured a cross section of 10 mm × 1.5 mm, the
smallest among all reported neural probes to the best of our knowl-
edge, hosting four electrodes on two opposite surfaces in a seven-layer
layout. To minimize volume and maximize flexibility, both types had
electrodes and interconnects on different layers electrically connected
by vias through the insulation layers. NET-50 probes were designed
analogous to the commonly used silicon neural probe (for example, a
single slab in NeuroNexus A8×8 design), whereas NET-10 probes
were designed to offer similar recording characteristics to tetrodes
(1, 3), both with aggressively reduced dimensions (fig. S1). Compared
with previously demonstrated neural probes (18, 21, 26), the NET
probes drastically reduced the effective bending stiffness and tissue
displacement per electrode for markedly improved biocompatibility
(fig. S2). Specifically, the bending stiffness was reduced by orders of

 magnitude to 10−15 N·m2, which brought down the probe-tissue inter-
facial force to the nanonewton range (fig. S3), on par with the single-
cell traction forces (27).
The ultraflexibility of the NET probes mechanically precluded their
self-supported penetration through brain tissue. Previous strategies for
delivering flexible probes included temporarily altering the probe’s ri-
gidity (20) and, more commonly, temporarily attaching the probe to a
rigid shuttle device (18, 19, 23, 28–31). However, most shuttle devices
used in previous studies had dimensions larger than 100 mm, which
were significantly larger than the dimensions of the NET probes and
resulted in unrecoverable damage and persistent scarring (24, 25). We
reduced the implantation footprints by about 10-fold to the cellular
dimensions by using a temporary engaging mechanism (Fig. 2A) and
shuttle devices made of carbon fibers and tungsten microwires with diam-
eters as small as 7 mm (Fig. 2B). The engaging mechanism was enabled
by a micropost at the end of each shuttle device fabricated using focused
ion beam (FIB) (fig. S4). During delivery, the micropost engaged into
the microhole (Fig. 2, C to E) and pulled the NET probe to the desired
depth (movie S1), after which the shuttle device disengaged and
retracted (Materials and Methods). The overall insertion footprint
was as small as ca. 10 mm across (Fig. 2, D and E), which led to only
cellular-sized surgical damage, as evidenced by little bleeding (Fig. 2,
F and G) and small insertion force (fig. S4). Taking advantage of
the ultraflexibility and the ultrasmall dimensions, we accommodated

 chronic optical access with NET implants (Fig. 2, H and I), which
allowed for monitoring of the tissue-probe interface by in vivo
two-photon (2P) imaging. The electrical integrity was maintained
throughout surgery and the implanted electrodes readily detected
unit activities (Fig. 2J).
We next evaluated the long-term reliability of the NET probes. We
implanted 16 probes into the somatosensory and visual cortices of seven
mice, containing a total of 80 of the 96 connected electrodes (83.3% fab-
rication yield). We performed electrical recording on anesthetized
animals twice a month for 4 months (Materials and Methods). We ob-
served that recording performance improved during the initial1.5months
and then remained stable for at least another 2.5 months (until the
conclusion of our experiment period) in the following aspects: First,
the average impedance and the noise level of all 80 electrodes decreased
in the first 1.5 months and remained stable (Fig. 3A). Second, the num-
ber of electrodes that detected unit events and sortable single-unit
action potentials (APs) increased in the first 1.5 months and then
remained at the same level (Fig. 3B; examples of unit activities that
include both nonsortable spikes and sortable single-unit APs are
detailed in fig. S5). The yields of multi-unit (~75%) and sortable
single-unit recording (~25%) were on par with conventional silicon
probes for spontaneous measurement under anesthesia (32), but with
unprecedented chronic stability. Third, we detected sortable AP wave-
forms from 19 electrodes with average amplitude and signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) being stable throughout the 4-month period (Fig. 3C).
We followed all 80 electrodes for 4 months and summarized their
animal- and probe-specific performance over time in table S1 and fig.
S5. Although there were variations in the number of functional electro-
des and the unit detection yield among different animals, stability and
consistency in unit detection over time were observed in all animals. As

 an example, Fig. 3D shows the bimonthly measurements from the
electrode that detected typical spike events and sortable AP waveforms
with the highest SNR (>30) among all electrodes. The persistently high
SNR of the sortable AP waveforms indicated that the firing neuron re-
mained in close proximity to the electrode for the entire duration of the
chronic recording (33). Combined principal component analysis for all
measurements showed largely overlapping clusters with cluster centers’
average position shifts between consecutive measurements equivalent
to 0.88s of the average cluster distribution (Fig. 3E), suggesting that
the waveforms were generated by the same neuron. In addition, we re-
peatedly detected interneuron waveforms from one electrode (fig. S6),
which were rare events (<10%) and served as a high-probability marker
for tracking the same neuron (34). Furthermore, we observed persistent
characteristics in AP waveforms, whereas minor trackable changes
occurred for all except one electrode (18 of 19, 94.7%; fig. S7). Signif-
icantly, in contrast to previous neuron probes where decreasing am-
plitudes were typically observed over time, most of the NET electrodes
recorded AP waveforms with nonmonotonic changes in peak-valley
amplitude. The recording evidence strongly indicates that the NET
probes form a nondegrading, slowly evolving interface with neurons.
To directly investigate the nature of the probe-tissue interface, we
monitored capillaries, astrocytes, and neurons around the NET probes
by in vivo 2P imaging at the implantation sites for up to 3.5 months after
surgery (Materials and Methods). Figure S8 shows the evolution of the
vasculature, showing that the surgical damage led to minor local leakage
of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) upon implantation, which lasted for at
most 1 month and was fully repaired in association with vascular remo-
deling. As shown in Fig. 4 (A and B) and movie S2, both types of NET
probes were embedded in capillaries with normal density, morpholo-
gy, and an intact BBB by 2 months. We measured the blood flow rate
by line scans (Fig. 4, C and D) (35) and obtained similar values next to
(420 ± 180 mm/s) and away from (450 ± 210 mm/s) the probe (Materials
and Methods), confirming that capillary perfusion immediately next to
the probe was normal. This is in strong contrast to conventional micro-
electrodes where continuousBBB leakage was observed in chronic in vivo
imaging at the interface (36).
We imaged the astrocytes by in vivo staining (Materials and
Methods) 3.5 months after implantation around a NET-50 probe
(Fig. 4E and movie S3). We note that the imaged segment was un-
intentionally folded during implantation with a sub–100-mm curva-
ture, which set the upper limit of tissue-probe stress for NET
probes. We observed that the astrocytes near the probe surrounded
only capillaries with normal density and morphology (similar to astro-
cytes from the contralateral hemisphere of the same mouse shown in
fig. S9). We also performed postmortem histology (Materials and
Methods) 5 months after implantation and observed normal neuron
density (fig. S10A) and resting microglia (Fig. 4F) near the probe. Re-
markably, direct contact with the probe did not affect the viability of
neurons, nor did it activate microglia (Fig. 4F) (24). These results show
that the NET probes have unprecedented biocompatibility as they
maintain normal vascular and cellular structures and elicit no observ-
able chronic tissue reactions at the interface.

 To reveal the evolution of the neural interface, we repeatedly imaged
neurons in the vicinity of both types of NET probes up to 3 months after
implantation and compared their locations relative to a few representa-
tive neurons and capillaries as position markers (movies S4 and S5 and
Fig. 4, G to J). We observed that all neurons initially imaged near the
probe were identified in later imaging sessions, which further proved
that the NET probes did not induce chronic neuronal loss. Further-
more, although most neurons were relatively stationary, some show
slow migrations (up to ca. 10 mm) over the course of a few weeks
(Fig. 4, I and J). Notably, we observed no preference in their migration
trajectories for moving toward or away from the NET probes.
DISCUSSION
The ultraflexibility of the NET probe prohibits conveniently advancing
to and recording from more than one brain region using schemes simi-
lar to microdrives that are widely applied in silicon probes and tetrodes.
Instead, recording from deeper brain regions or from different brain
tissue depths can be realized by implanting NET probes patterned with
more electrodes spanning a larger depth, especially given the un-
precedented tissue compatibility demonstrated here. Accommodating
more electrodes on one probe does not necessarily increase the probe’s
dimension, as we can further increase the fabrication resolution by
using electron beam lithography techniques (37).
We have thoroughly examined our full fabrication process and
identified that the loss of yield is mainly due to fabrication defects.
Our fabrication involves seven photolithography steps using a manual
mask aligner and three metal deposition steps, which makes it difficult
to completely avoid microparticles and scratches. Furthermore, our
design has narrow metal lines (the interconnects, 2 to 3 mm wide) rou-
ted over 5 mm, which is vulnerable to microdefects. We expect that
one can significantly improve the fabrication yield by using automated
photolithography tools that can eliminate most of the defect sources.
The NET probes can be readily fabricated in linear arrays, similar to
the conventional silicon probes. We estimate that we can deliver up to
12 NET probes within 40 min on the basis of the demonstrated average
delivery time of 3 min per probe. The closest interprobe spacing we have
achieved is about 200 mm, as shown in Fig. 2G. The accuracy in inter-
probe space is currently determined by the accuracy in the initial
positioning of the NET probe (under a stereomicroscope) on the brain
surface before delivery, which has an uncertainty of up to 30 mm.
The NET probes performed stably in mice for at least 4 months, as
evidenced by the intact device structure (fig. S10) and the stable imped-
ance and recording performance (Fig. 3), which are sufficient for most
scientific studies and warrant further research on their performance in
longer-term implantation (on the order of years). We attribute the sta-
ble performance of NETs to their unconventional dimensions and de-
sign, which can be explained by the following aspects: (i) The most
prevalent failure modes in conventional devices are structural degrada-
tions, such as cracking, blistering, and delamination (38), none of which
were observed in chronically implanted NETs (fig. S10, B and C). This
can be attributed to the fact that the ultrathin thickness of NETs (1 mm)
greatly reduces the strain on the device upon deformation, which
prevents the formation of structural defects. (ii) Another major failure
mode in conventional polymer implants is delamination due to insuf-
ficient bonding at interfaces (39). In NET probes, the SU-8 insulating
layer adheres mainly with another SU-8 layer by thermal curing and
cross-linking, which eliminated this failure mode. (iii) Most polymers
absorb water under physiological conditions, which may lead to electri-
cal leakage that results in signal attenuation. However, the possible wa-
ter absorption–induced leakage did not affect our long-term recording
performance, mostly because it did not induce structural damage of the
NET as shown above, likely due to the improved adhesion between
layers and reduced stress. Furthermore, NET probes were soaked for
several days in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and other water solu-
tions before implantation, which preconditioned the SU-8 film to a
saturated water absorption of 3.3% (40), such that no signal attenuation
was observed after implantation. Consistent with no structural deterio-
ration, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed a high
impedance, moderately capacitive circuit over a large frequency range
(fig. S11), and little cross-talk was observed from adjacent electrodes
(fig. S12).
A very recent study reported stable long-term recording in mice
using mesh electrodes on a similar device platform (31). The con-
sistency between their study and ours strongly supports the validity
of using ultraflexible devices, particularly polymer-based devices with
an overall thickness of about 1 mm, for long-term neural activity map-
ping. Here, we further reduced both the device width and the surgical
footprint to cellular dimensions, such that no persistent glial scar was
observed near the implants in our study. In addition, we characterized
the interface not only by postmortem histology, which gave a
“snapshot” assessment, but also by repeated in vivo imaging of thick
tissue stacks, which unambiguously revealed the evolution of vascular
and cellular networks around the implanted NET probes.
Combining the results from chronic recording and in vivo imag-
ing, we gain a comprehensive understanding of the neural interface
formed by the NET probes. In vivo imaging and histology studies re-
vealed a chronic tissue response free interface, which provides the
biological foundation for nondegrading recording performance. More-
over, because the interface is dynamically evolving, which involves re-
modeling of vasculature and other changes in the microbiological
environment, both the neurons and the NET probes are not complete-
ly stationary over a time frame of a few months. Correspondingly, we
observed neuron migrations at a few micrometers per month, which
led to slowly evolving waveforms in chronic recordings that could be
reliably tracked by measurements twice a month.
We demonstrated that the NET probes form reliable, glial scar–free
integration with the living brain by chronic recording, in vivo 2P im-
aging, and postmortem characterization of the tissue-probe interface.
The unprecedented chronic reliability and stability are expected to
fundamentally advance both basic and applied neuroscience, as well
as lead to substantial improvement in the brain-machine interface
which can be applied to neuroprosthetics (41). Furthermore, the sub-
cellular dimension probes provide new opportunities for high-density
electrical recording by overcoming current physical limitations (42).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
NET brain probe fabrication and preparation
The NET brain probes were fabricated using specialized fabrication
methods similar to those previously reported (20, 43). The multilayer
probes were fabricated using photolithography on a nickel metal release
layer deposited on a silicon substrate (900 nm SiO2, n-type 0.005 V·cm,
University Wafer). An SU-8 photoresist (SU-8 2000.5, MicroChem
Corp.), whichoffersexcellent tensile strength, ease of fabrication, anddem-
onstrated durability in ultrathin structures (fig. S10) (20, 23, 43), was
used to construct the insulating layers. We used the minimum thick-
ness of the dielectric layer necessary for preventing more than 1% signal

 attenuation through the capacitive coupling between the interconnects
and the conductive medium surrounding the probe, which was
determined to be about 500 nm for our probe geometry and material.
Platinum or gold was used for electrodes (size: 30 mm × 30 mm for NET-
50 and 10 mm × 20 mm for NET-10) and interconnects, respectively,
both with a thickness of 100 nm. The different sizes and materials used
for the electrodes contributed to most of the variation in impedance, as
shown in Fig. 3A. After fabrication, a 33-pin flexible flat connectors
(FFC) (series 502598, Molex) was mounted on the matching contact
pads on the Si substrate. The implantable section of the probe was then
soaked in nickel etchant (TFB, Transene Co. Inc.) for 2 to 4 hours at
25°C to release the free-standing portion of the probe, while the contact
region remained attached to the substrate. The substrate was cleaved to
the desired length before implantation.
Shuttle device fabrication and assembly
A straight segment of a carbon fiber or tungsten wire was attached to a
stainless steel microneedle (prod# 13561–10, Ted Pella Inc.) for con-
venient handling. It was then cut to the designed length (2 to 3 mm)
using FIB. An anchor post was micromilled at the tip of the shuttle de-
vice using FIB to shape a well-defined micropost (3 mm in diameter
and 5 mm in height, fig. S4).
Animals and surgery
Wild-type male mice (C57BJ/6, 8 weeks old, Taconic) and male trans-
genic strain [B6.Cg-Tg(Thy1-YFP)16Jrs/J, to which yellow fluorescent
proteins were expressed in neurons; The Jackson Laboratory] were
used in the experiments. Mice were housed at the Animal Resources
Center at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin (at a 12-hour light/
dark cycle at 22°C, with food and water ad libitum).
Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (3% for induction and
maintained at 1 to 2%) in medical-grade oxygen. The skull was exposed
and prepared by scalping the crown and removing the fascia and then
was scored with the tip of a scalpel blade. A 3-mm × 3-mm square
craniotomy was performed with a surgical drill over the somato-
sensory cortex. Dura mater was carefully removed to facilitate the de-
livery. After NET probe implantation (described below), the remaining
flexible segment of the NET probe, which connected the bonding pad
on the substrate with the electrodes inside the brain, was routed to the
edge of the cranial opening. The exposed brain was then protected by
artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) and coverslip #1 (Fisher Scientific)
fit into the cranial opening. The space between the coverslip and the
remaining skull was filled with Kwik-Sil adhesive (World Precision
Instruments). After the skull was cleaned and dried, a layer of low-
viscosity cyanoacrylate was applied over the skull. An initial layer of
C&B-Metabond (Parkell Inc.) was applied over the cyanoacrylate and
the Kwik-Sil adhesive. A second layer of Metabond was used to cement
the coverslip and the NET carrier chip to the skull. All procedures

Neural probe delivery
In typical procedures, a flexible neural probe was placed on the
brain surface where dura mater was removed. The shuttle device was
vertically mounted on a micromanipulator (MP-285, Sutter Instrument)
and positioned atop the engaging hole at the end of the probe. As
the shuttle device traveled downward, the anchor post entered the hole
and pulled the neural probe into the brain tissue. Once the neural
probe reached the desired depth, the shuttle device was retracted,
and the neural probe was released and left embedded in the brain
tissue. Because the volume of both the shuttle device and the neural
probe was minimized to reduce tissue damage, the delivery process
was delicate. A few experimental details are important to the success
of the delivery. First, the anchor post of the shuttle device needs to be
microfabricated precisely according to the well-defined cylindrical
shape as designed, so that it can fit into the engaging hole on the probe,
can have sufficient mechanical strength for the delivery, and can be
retracted out of the brain without pulling the probe out with it. Second,
the axial direction of the shuttle device needs to be aligned with the
insertion direction to minimize buckling. Third, ACSF needs to be
added to the brain surface as the shuttle device drags the probe into
the brain to float the remaining flexible segment and to minimize fric-
tion between the probe and the brain surface. By controlling the
engaging location and the insertion depth, we delivered NET probes
to specific regions of interest. Multiple-probe delivery was achieved by
repeating the same process sequentially.
2P imaging
2P imaging was performed using a laser scanning microscope (Prairie
Technology) equipped with a 20× water immersion objective (numer-
ical aperture, 1.0; Zeiss) and a Ti:sapphire excitation laser (Mai Tai
DeepSee, Spectra-Physics) from acute to up to 3.5 months after im-
plantation. The laser was tuned to 810 to 910 nm for 2P excitation
(power, 3.0 to 50 mW; dwell time, 4.0 to 6.0 ms). Fluorescence emis-
sions were detected simultaneously by two standard photomultiplier
tubes with a 595/50-nm filter (Semrock) for “red” fluorescence emis-
sion and a 525/70-nm filter (Semrock) for “green” fluorescence emis-
sion. Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (3% for induction and
1.5% during experiment) in medical-grade oxygen to maintain full im-
mobility during imaging and placed in a frame that stabilized the head
on the microscope stage. For 2P imaging on capillaries, anesthetized
animals were given fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–dextran (0.1 ml,
5% w/v, Sigma-Aldrich) retro-orbitally to label blood vessels before
imaging. For 2P imaging on astrocytes, anesthetized animals were
given sulforhodamine 101 (44) (0.1 ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and Optison
(GE Healthcare, 0.1 ml) retro-orbitally. Immediately following the
injection, focused ultrasound with a center frequency of 2.25 MHz
in the tone burst mode (rate, 20 Hz; burst duration, 10 ms; duty
cycle, 20%) was applied to the regions of interest for 45 s to tempora-
rily break the BBB (45). Animals were imaged 2 hours after ultra-
sound treatment to ensure sufficient dye diffusion and staining. To
facilitate the imaging of the probe-tissue interface beyond superficial
cortical layers, we doped the probes with sulforhodamine 6G (Sigma-
Aldrich) in the insulating layers and delivered them at about 45° with
respect to the skull.
Line scan and blood flow speed
We inferred the blood flow speed from the motion of red blood cells
(RBCs) shown as stripes in line-scan measurements, that is, repetitive
scans of the laser along the central axis of a capillary. The animal was
given FITC-dextran (0.1 ml, 5% w/v, Sigma-Aldrich) retro-orbitally before
imaging. After obtaining a 2P image of capillaries at the desired depth,
we identified a capillary of interest and electromechanically oriented
the direction of the scan along it. We typically scanned a distance of
30 to 40 mm with 128 pixels per line, repeating 128 to 256 times at
1 to 2 ms per scan. We imaged nine capillaries in the vicinity of a
NET-50 probe and six capillaries from the contralateral hemisphere

 of the same mouse. The blood flow speed was 420 ± 180 mm/s near
the probe, similar to 450 ± 210 mm/s away from the probe.
Histological sample preparation
Mice were given lethal intraperitoneal injections of 0.15 ml of ketamine
mixed with xylazine [xylazine (10 mg/ml) in ketamine (90 mg/ml)] and
then perfused intracardially with oxygenated, cold (∼4°C) modified
ACSF (2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3, 0.5 mM
CaCl2, 7 mM MgCl2, 7 mM dextrose, 205.5 mM sucrose, 1.3 mM as-
corbic acid, and 3.7 mM pyruvate) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde
in 0.02 M PBS. Brains were cryoprotected in a 30% sucrose/4% para-
formaldehyde solution overnight. Tissue was sectioned into 20- to
50-mm slices perpendicular to the probe using a Leica CM1950 cry-
ostat (Leica Microsystems). The slices were washed (3 × 5 min) and
incubated in hot sodium citrate solution (85°C to 95°C, 0.01 M in
H2O) for 30 min for antigen retrieval. Then, the slices were washed
(3 × 5 min), incubated in blocking solution and permeabilized [0.5%
Triton X-100 and 10% normal goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS]
for 3 hours at room temperature, washed (4 × 5 min), and incubated
in fluorophore-conjugated antibodies for 24 hours at 4°C.
Reagents used for different cell types are as follows (Millipore):
neurons: Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated anti-NeuN antibody, clone
A60; microglia: Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated anti–glial fibrillary acidic
protein antibody, clone GA5.
Neural recording
Voltage signals from the neural electrodes were amplified and digi-
tized using a 32-channel RHD2132 evaluation system (Intan Technol-
ogies) with a bare Ag wire inserted into the contralateral hemisphere
of the brain as the grounding reference. The animal was anesthetized
with 1.5% isoflurane in medical-grade O2 during the measurement.
The sampling rate was 20 kHz, and a 300-Hz high-pass filter and a
60-Hz notch filter were applied for single-unit recording. The imped-
ance of the electrodes was measured using the same equipment at
1000 Hz. Variation in impedance was mostly attributed to the differ-
ent sizes and materials of the electrodes (materials: Pt/Au; sizes: 30 mm ×
30 mm for NET-50 and 10 mm × 20 mm for NET-10). Spike detection
and spike sorting were performed using Offline Sorter (Plexon).
