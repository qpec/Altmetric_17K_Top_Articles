Abstract
The ages of puberty, first sexual intercourse and first birth signify the onset of reproductive ability, 
behaviour and success, respectively. These sequenced events have behavioural, physiological and 
health significance, and may also influence overall reproductive fitness. In a genome-wide 
association study of 125,667 white men and women aged 40-69 in the UK Biobank Study, we 
identify 38 sequence variants with association P-values <5×10-8 with age at first sexual 
intercourse. Findings were taken forward in up to 241,910 men and women from deCODE Iceland 
and 20,187 from Women’s Genome Health Study. Several of these loci also exhibit strong 
associations with behavioural traits (rs4856591 in CADM2 and risk taking propensity: 
P=4.3×10-10; rs73195303 in MSRA and irritable temperament: P=5.8×10-11) and other 
reproductive traits (rs67229052 in ESR1 and both age at first birth: P=1.2x10-13 and number of 
children: P=4.8×10-12; rs2188151 in SEMA3F and age at first birth: P=8.76×10-15). In Mendelian 
randomisation analyses, we demonstrate likely causal influences of earlier puberty timing on 
earlier first sexual intercourse, earlier first birth and fewer years of education. In turn, likely causal 
consequences of earlier first sexual intercourse include reproductive, educational, psychiatric and

 cardiometabolic outcomes. These findings point to the existence of developmental and neuro-
behavioural regulators of reproductive activity and success.
Introduction
The age of puberty, the transition from childhood to sexual maturity and reproductive ability, 
has fallen markedly over the last century in most populations, illustrated by the average age 
at menarche of 18 years in 1880 to 12.5 years in 1980 (ref.1,2). This decline was initially 
observed in industrialized, western countries, and more recently, and often far more rapidly, 
in countries with more recent economic transitions3. These changes likely reflect increases 
in childhood nutrition and body size, but exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals or 
other specific environmental factors have also been proposed1. In contemporary cohorts, 
earlier puberty timing, in both men and women, is associated with greater propensity 
towards risk-taking behaviours4,5, lower educational attainment, greater susceptibility to 
several adverse health outcomes6 and, in women, to increased mortality.7 Conversely, it has 
been proposed that earlier puberty timing is a life-history strategy that promotes greater 
reproductive fitness8. Yet, despite some reports that earlier puberty timing is associated with 
younger age at first sexual intercourse (AFS)9,10 and younger age at first birth (AFB), there 
is yet little evidence that this trait is associated with reproductive fitness11.
In contrast to the small body of evidence on the role of puberty timing on AFS, most 
research on the predictors or determinants of AFS is contextualized in terms of the social, 
economic and cultural environment, including the nature of interpersonal relationships. 
Hence, established correlates of younger AFS include social disadvantage, family instability, 
low levels of parental monitoring, and lack of religious affiliation and belief12–14. In 
particular, parental and peer norms and behaviours have a strong influence on teenagers’ 
sexual behaviour14–16. Twin studies have suggested some genetic contribution to 
AFS17,18, however observations of older AFS among monozygous compared to dizygous 
twins13 casts doubt on the validity of twins studies to accurately estimate the heritability of 
this trait.
Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 123 sequence variants 
independently associated with timing of menarche in females19, and these signals appear to 
have concordant effects on puberty timing also in males20. A valuable application of such 
GWAS findings is the use of genetic variants, with robust association with a specified trait, 
as instrumental variables in (“Mendelian randomisation”) analyses to test the likely causal 
relationships with that trait with less risk of confounding compared to traditionally observed 
associations21. Here, we use this approach to test the causal relationship of puberty 
timing19 to AFS and AFB. We also perform a GWAS to identify sequence variants 
associated with AFS and AFB, and use these findings to test the causal relationships 
between the timings of the onset of reproductive ability, activity and success to other 
behavioural and health-related outcomes.

 Results
Shared genetic architecture between reproductive onset traits
We used whole-genome LD score regression22 to test the genetic correlations between the 
timings of puberty, first sexual intercourse and first birth; such correlations quantify the 
extent of shared genetic architecture. Data on genome-wide SNP associations with puberty 
timing were recently reported19. To generate such scores for the other two traits, we 
performed association tests across a genome-wide panel of ~46M SNPs for self-reported 
AFS and AFB (recorded in women only) in 59,357 men and 66,310 women in the UK 
Biobank study. In this sample, median and inter-quartile range (IQR) for AFS was 18 years 
(16-21) in men and 18 years (17-21) in women, median (IQR) AFB was 25 years (22-28) 
(recorded in women only), and the SNP-based test REML23 indicated moderate heritability 
for AFS both in men (h=0.248, s.e. 0.010) and in women (h=0.242, s.e. 0.010), and also 
moderate heritability for AFB (h=0.290, s.e. 0.015, women only). Using the three scores, we 
found moderately strong positive genetic correlations between puberty timing and AFS, both 
in women (rg=0.22, P=1.2×10-16) and men (rg=0.26, P=9.5×10-8), and between puberty 
timing and AFB (rg=0.24, P=9.0×10-13; women only). Furthermore, we found a remarkably 
strong genetic correlation between AFS and AFB (rg=0.86, P=3.1×10-136).
Genetic correlations have been reported between puberty timing and a range of other health-
related traits, including inverse correlations with body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD)20. In the same way, we used whole-genome LD 
score regression22 to test genetic correlations between AFS and other health-related traits 
using publicly available GWAS datasets or original GWAS findings in UK Biobank (see 
Methods). We identified genetic correlations between AFS and 22 of the 44 tested outcomes 
or traits after correction for multiple testing (P<1.1×10-3), including inverse correlations 
with BMI, T2D and CVD, and also with a variety of behavioural (e.g. smoking; alcohol 
intake) and neurological traits (e.g. intelligence; risk taking propensity) and psychiatric 
outcomes (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); schizophrenia) (Figure 2).
In a sex-combined GWAS in UK Biobank, we identified 33 loci with variants associated at 
P<5×10-8 with AFS (Table 1, Figure 1, Figure S1-2). Nine of these loci showed sex-
discordant associations (Pheterogeneity<0.05), and subsequent sex-specific models identified 
an additional five signals, four in men and one in women (Table 1). Across these 38 AFS 
loci, effect sizes ranged from 0.02-0.33 SDs, minor allele frequencies (MAF) ranged from 
0.15% to 49%. Seventeen of these variants were associated with AFS at the more stringent 
P-value threshold P<1×10-9. In UK Biobank, no loci were found associated at P<5×10-8 
with AFB in women.
In the absence of other large GWAS for AFS, we relied on the strong genetic correlation 
between AFS and AFB in women to collectively confirm our genetic findings in two 
independent datasets: deCODE (N=117,626 males, 124,284 females) and the Women’s 
Genome Health Study (WGHS, N=20,187 women). A weighted SNP genotype score of our 
38 novel signals for AFS was strongly associated with AFB in both deCODE (P=3.3×10-21) 
and WGHS (P=9.2×10-4) (Table S1, S2 and S6). The subset of 21 ‘less stringently

 associated’ AFS variants (those with association P-values: 1×10-9≥P<5×10-8) was also 
collectively associated with AFB (weighted SNP genotype score in deCODE: P=3.1×10-7).
Biological determinants of age at first sexual intercourse
None of the 38 lead AFS-associated variants (or their r2>0.8 proxies) were non-synonymous 
SNPs, however several were located in regions containing promoter/enhancer histone marks, 
DNAse hypersensitive sites or protein binding sites (Table S3). In addition, the majority of 
these variants either altered regulatory motifs or were associated in cis with gene expression 
(Table S4)
To identify mechanisms that might regulate AFS, we performed a systematic test of all 
annotated biological pathways for enrichment of genes located near to AFS-associated 
signals, using MAGENTA (see Methods, Table S5). Four pathways were associated with 
AFS: “Circadian clock system”, “Packaging of telomere ends”, RNA Polymerase-I promoter 
opening and “NOTCH HLH transcription”.
We then tested puberty timing and body size as specific a priori candidate determinants of 
AFS, by performing Mendelian randomization analyses in the UK Biobank sample. For each 
exposure, we created a genetic instrumental variable by calculating a weighted allele score 
from the SNP genotypes at reported signals with robust associations with each phenotype 
(see methods, Tables S6-S10). In both men and women, genetically-predicted earlier puberty 
timing (Pwomen=2.0×10-9, Pmen=4.7×10-11) and genetically-predicted greater BMI 
(Pmen=5.5×10-8, Pwomen=2.2×10-4) appeared to promote earlier AFS (Tables S7-S8). 
Genetically-predicted greater height appeared to promote later AFS in men (P=1.0×10-5) 
and in women (P=1.1×10-3) (Table S9), which is consistent with reported non-genetic 
associations between greater height and later AFB in European men and women24.
Prompted by our observation of a novel AFS locus near MC1R (rs369230 r2=0.12 with the 
variant rs12931267 that is strongly associated with hair colour)25,26, we tested genetic 
instrumental variables for skin freckling and hair colour, which are traits regulated by this 
gene25,26. Genetically-predicted skin freckling appeared to promote later AFS in women 
(P=6.3×10-9) but not in men (P=0.47), and genetically-predicted red hair appeared to 
promote later AFS in both men (P=0.02) and women (P=9.3×10-5; Table S10).
Relationships to other behavioural, reproductive and health outcomes
To test whether puberty timing and AFS might be causally related to other behavioural, 
reproductive and health outcomes, we performed Mendelian randomization analyses using 
weighted allele scores calculated from SNP genotypes at signals associated with puberty 
timing19 or AFS (described above) as genetic instrumental variables for these traits. To 
reduce bias, we avoided testing health outcomes in the same datasets that were used to 
generate the allele weightings (i.e. outcomes related to AFS were tested in datasets other 
than UK Biobank). Genetic associations were scaled to indicate the likely causal effect of a 
one SD change in normalised puberty timing or AFS.
Genetically-predicted earlier puberty timing decreased the age at leaving education 
(standardised beta: 0.061, P=4.0×10-7; in UK Biobank) (Table S11). Similarly, genetically-

 predicted earlier AFS decreased the likelihood of attaining university-level education 
(standardised OR=0.74, P=3.7×10-5; in publicly-available Social Science Genetic 
Association Consortium data) and increased the likelihood of ever-smoking (standardised 
OR=1.33, P=2.0×10-3; in publicly-available Tobacco and Genetics Consortium data) (Table 
S9). For reproductive outcomes, in the deCODE data, each one SD genetically-predicted 
earlier AFS promoted earlier AFB (women: standardised beta=1.71, P=2.2×10-17; men: 
1.69, P=2.6×10-13; combined P=3.3×10-21), a greater number of children (women: 
standardised beta= 0.035, P=0.006; men: 0.012, P=0.34; combined P=0.0044), and lower 
likelihood of being childless (women: standardised OR=0.67, P=0.034; men: OR=0.66, 
P=0.009; combined P=0.0022) (Table S1). Similarly, each one SD genetically-predicted 
earlier puberty timing promoted earlier AFB (standardised beta: 0.37, P=5.8×10-8; assessed 
in UK Biobank women only) and earlier age at last birth (0.37, P=3.7×10-7; in UK Biobank 
women), but had little effect on other reproductive outcomes (Tables S6 and S11).
We noted that several of the 38 novel AFS signals were located in or near genes reportedly 
implicated in brain development (BARHL2, SEMA3F, ZIC4/ZIC1, DPYSL4, DIAPH3), or 
neuronal activity and/or susceptibility to schizophrenia/bipolar disorder (CADM2, LRP4, 
GRIA4, CACMA1D, HCN1, GRIA4, DRD2, FURIN, GNAL and VRK2) (Table 1 and S3), 
consistent with our observed shared genetic architecture between AFS and ADHD (rg= 
-0.38, P=5.9×10-4), and between AFS and schizophrenia (rg= -0.10, P=7.3×10-4) (Figure 2). 
We used a bi-directional Mendelian randomisation approach to test the likely causal 
relationships: susceptibility to schizophrenia appeared to lower AFS (in UK Biobank with or 
without exclusion of individuals with self-reported psychiatric illness: P=0.005; Table S13), 
but also, earlier AFS appeared to increase susceptibility to schizophrenia (in publicly 
available Psychiatry Genetics Consortium data, P=4.1×10-11, Table S12), suggesting a 
pleiotropic relationship between these traits. The substantial shared genetic architecture 
between AFS and self-reported risk taking propensity (rg= -0.46, P=7.3×10-28) (Figure 2) 
gives insights into possible common determinants of AFS and schizophrenia.
To explore potential specific neuro-behavioural mechanisms that might contribute to the 
aetiology of AFS, we performed a look-up of the 38 individual AFS loci for associations 
with fifteen other behavioural, reproductive and health-related traits in UK Biobank and 
other independent studies (see methods; Figure 3; Table S14).
CADM2 and MSRA loci influence multiple behavioural traits
The AFS signal represented by rs57401290 is intronic in CADM2, which encodes a 
neuronal cell-adhesion molecule. rs57401290, or highly correlated SNPs in this locus, also 
showed genome-wide significant associations in UK Biobank with: self-reported risk taking 
propensity (rs57401290: P=5.3×10-9; r2=0.65 with the lead CADM2 SNP for this trait 
rs4856591: P=4.3×10-10), number of sexual partners (rs57401290: P=6.0×10-7; r2=0.60 with 
lead SNP rs5850688: P=4.1×10-8) and number of children (rs57401290: P=6.2×10-7, 
r2=0.65 with lead SNP rs4856591: P=3.8x10-11, replication in deCODE P=0.006) (Table 
S14). In each case, the AFS-decreasing allele conferred higher values of those outcomes. 
rs57401290 is modestly correlated with the reported signal at this locus for BMI27 (r2=0.11 
with rs13078960, the AFS-decreasing allele also increases BMI) and is strongly correlated

 with the reported signal in CADM2 for cognitive processing speed28 (rs17518584 r2=0.80, 
the AFS-decreasing allele also decreases processing speed). CADM2 shows highest 
expression in the prefrontal cortex and is involved in a range of neuronal processes, 
including glutamate signaling, gamma-aminobutyric acid transport and neuron cell-cell 
adhesion28.
The AFS-decreasing allele at rs658385 (~25 kb downstream of MSRA) was also associated 
in UK Biobank with lower likelihood of self-reported irritable temperament (P=3.8×10-4) 
and was modestly correlated (r2=0.14) with the lead MSRA SNP for this trait (rs73195303, 
P=5.8×10-11). Conditional analyses excluded the presence of independent secondary signals 
for AFS or irritable temperament at this locus. The enzyme encoded by MSRA reduces 
methionine sulfoxide to methionine and hence repairs proteins that have been inactivated by 
oxidative stress, which is a candidate mechanism in cognitive impairment and schizophrenia/
bipolar disorder29. Overexpression of msra in the fruit fly Drosophila is reported to 
markedly delay reproductive capacity and extend life span30.
ESR1 and RBM6/SEMA3F loci influence reproductive traits
The AFS-decreasing allele at rs726281 (intronic in ESR1, which encodes the estrogen 
receptor) was also associated in UK Biobank with earlier AFB in women (P=6.9×10-3), 
higher number of children in women (P=7.0 ×10-5) (Figure 3). This locus contains a 
moderately correlated intronic variant rs67229052 in ESR1 (r2=0.25) that is also associated 
with AFS (P=1.6×10-10), AFB (P=2.4×10-7), and number of children in women 
(P=3.7×10-8) in UK Biobank (Table 2). In deCODE and WGHS these associations with 
rs67229052 were robustly confirmed in women and, in deCODE, were extended to include 
men (rs67229052: AFB in men P=6.7×10-9; number of children in men P=1.9×10-6; Table 
2). Conditional analyses excluded the presence of independent secondary signals at this 
ESR1 locus for either AFS or AFB and, apart from modest correlation between rs726281 
and the reported adult height variant (r2=0.16 with rs3020418), rs726281 and rs67229052 
were unrelated to the reported GWAS signals in this gene for puberty timing, breast cancer, 
breast size and bone mineral density (all r2<0.05).
The AFS signal at rs2188151 is highly correlated with a missense variant in SEMA3F 
(r2=0.7 with rs1046956; Leu503Met in semaphorin-3F isoform X2), which encodes a 
semaphorin protein, and is a cis eQTL for RBM6 (P=5×10-143), which encodes an RNA 
binding protein. rs2188151 is correlated with the reported GWAS signals for HDL (r2=0.45 
with rs2013208) and puberty timing (r2=0.18 with rs2188151); in publicly available 
ReproGen consortium data the AFS-decreasing allele confers later puberty timing. In both 
men and women (Table 2), the AFS-decreasing allele at rs2188151 was also associated with 
earlier AFB (sex combined: P=8.76×10-15), greater BMI (P=3.6×10-15; look-up in publicly 
available GIANT consortium data: P=3.9×10-5), a greater number of children (P=9.05×10-5) 
and lower likelihood of being childless (P=9.38×10-5).
Discussion
Here, we show that a substantial proportion of the variation in AFS is due to genetic factors, 
which likely act through a variety of biological mechanisms, many of which influence either

 physical traits, such as puberty timing, or personality characteristics, such as risk-taking 
propensity. Previous studies have invariably focused on only the socio-cultural determinants 
of AFS and the relevance of early AFS to poor educational achievement and other adverse 
outcomes12,13. We recognise the importance of diverse socio-cultural factors, which are 
reflected by the discordant changes in AFS and AFB seen by year of birth in the UK 
Biobank study (Figure S4). However, despite such marked secular changes, the genetic 
contribution to AFS has remained stable over time (estimated heritability in men and women 
born pre-1950: h=0.262, s.e. 0.017; in those born in 1950 onwards: h=0.283, s.e. 0.015).
The neuro-behavioural traits associated with AFS can be broadly categorised as stimulus-
seeking (risk taking) and moderating traits such as intelligence and neuroticism (irritability). 
Risk taking is itself related to an exuberant temperament and is moderated by executive 
function31, which are neurocognitive traits implicated in both AFS17,18 and 
schizophrenia32–34. Furthermore, our extended findings with the AFS signal at CADM2 
indicate that neuro-behavioural traits, such as cognitive processing speed28 and risk taking 
propensity, may also have important relevance to measures of reproductive success, such as 
number of children. We suggest that future population-based study designs to study the pre-
morbid personality and cognitive traits associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder 
may inform the psychological and biological processes that contribute to reproductive 
behaviour and fecundity.
A notable finding was the AFS locus intronic in ESR1. Effects of estrogen signalling on 
reproductive ability in women have been long predicted from models of response to fertility-
inducing hormones35,36, consistent with effects of estrogens on promoting ovarian follicle 
maturation and uterine receptivity to implantation37,38. Estrogen receptors are highly 
expressed in male pituitary, prostate, testis, breast and liver (Figure S3), and disrupted 
signalling leads to low sperm concentrations and infertility, both in humans39,40 and in a 
rodent model41. However, the variants at this locus that we found associated with 
reproductive behaviour (AFS) and reproductive success (AFB) in both sexes, were largely 
unrelated to the ESR1 variants reportedly associated with other traits (puberty timing, breast 
cancer, breast size and bone mineral density). The possibility of a central tissue-specific 
effect of this ESR1 variant rs67229052 is supported by its demonstration as an eQTL for 
ESR1 in only one of ˜50 GTEX tissues (with “brain_caudate_basal_ganglia”, using the 
r2=0.98 proxy rs4305732); the allele associated with higher ESR1 expression (P=0.0004) is 
also associated with later AFS, later AFB and fewer children. Central estrogen receptor 
signalling was recently described as a biological regulator of socio-reproductive behaviours 
in male mice42. Our findings support a neuro-behavioural role for ESR1 in both men and 
women. Furthermore, our findings of robust associations between AFS-associated ESR1 
variants and number of children and likelihood of being childless in mid-late adult life 
suggest that central processes, such as hypothalamic-pituitary sex hormone signalling and 
neuro-cognitive traits, may contribute to reproductive success.
Our genetic findings indicate that both physical maturation and neuro-behavioural traits 
contribute to the timing of reproductive activity and success, with consequences for 
educational and behavioural outcomes. Consideration of individual variation in pubertal 
timing and also personality characteristics, such as high risk-taking propensity and low

 neuroticism, may contribute to targeted and more effective approaches to health education 
and promotion of safer health-related behaviours.
Methods
UK Biobank
The UK Biobank study design has been reported43. Briefly, all people aged 40–69 years 
who were registered with the National Health Service and living up to ˜25 miles from one of 
the 22 study assessment centres were invited to participate in 2006-10. Overall, about 9.2 
million invitations were mailed in order to recruit 503,325 participants (i.e. a response rate 
of 5.47%)44. Extensive self-reported baseline data were collected by questionnaire, in 
addition to anthropometric assessments. Details of the phenotypes analysed here are shown 
in Table S15. All participants provided informed written consent, the study was approved by 
the National Research Ethics Service Committee North West – Haydock, and all study 
procedures were performed in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration 
of Helsinki ethical principles for medical research.
Genetic analysis in UK Biobank
We analysed data from the May 2015 release of imputed genetic data from UK Biobank, 
containing ˜73M SNPs, short indels and large structural variants in 152,249 individuals. Full 
details are published (see URLs). Briefly, the samples were genotyped on two slightly 
different arrays. Approximately 50,000 were genotyped by a custom UL BiLEVE study 
array, and the remaining samples (˜100,000) were genotyped on the UK Biobank Axiom 
array from Affymetrix, which was specifically designed to optimize imputation performance 
in GWAS studies. Removal of SNPs with missing data, multi-allelic SNPs, SNPs with a 
minor allele frequency (MAF) <1%, and 1,037 sample outliers, resulted in a dataset with 
641,018 autosomal SNPs in 152,256 samples for phasing and imputation. Imputation was 
performed using a reference panel created by merging the UK10K haplotype panel with the 
1000 Genomes Phase 3 reference panel.
In addition to the quality control metrics performed centrally by UK Biobank, we defined a 
subset of “white European” ancestry samples using a K-means clustering approach applied 
to the first four principle components calculated from genome-wide SNP genotypes. All 
individuals defined in this group also self-identified by questionnaire as being of white 
ancestry. Autosomal SNPs were analysed by linear mixed models implemented in BOLT-
LMM23 to account for cryptic population structure and relatedness within this group in our 
genetic association tests. X chromosome SNPs were analysed using SNPTEST45. 
Genotyping chip was included as a binary covariate in all models. Any SNPs with an 
imputation quality < 0.4 or MAF < 0.1% were excluded post-analysis. After application of 
QC criteria, a maximum of 142,630 individuals were available for analysis with genotype 
and phenotype data. There was no substantial effect on test statistics after exclusion from the

 models of those individuals with any reported psychiatric illness. Genomic loci were defined 
on the basis of physical proximity using a 1 Mb window. Signals were excluded from 
consideration if they were significantly associated with genotyping chip.
Variance component analyses were performed in the subset of individuals of only “white 
british” genetic ancestry (maximum analysed N=99,241) using Restricted Estimate 
Maximum Likelihood (REML) models in BOLT-LMM46. Genetic variance was calculated 
on all QC’d genotyped autosomal SNPs, adjusting for chip status and the top 5 genetically 
determined principal components.
Replication studies
deCODE Genetics: Whole genomes of 8,453 Icelanders were sequenced using Illumina 
technology to a mean depth of at least 10X (median 32X) and SNPs and indels identified 
and their genotypes called using joint calling with the Genome Analysis Toolkit 
HaplotypeCaller (GATK version 3.3.0)47. Genotype calls were improved by using 
information about haplotype sharing, taking advantage of the fact that all the sequenced 
individuals had also been chip-typed and long range phased. Around 30M sequenced 
variants were then imputed into 150,656 Icelanders who had been genotyped using the 
Illumina HumanHap300, HumanCNV370, HumanHap610, HumanHap1M, HumanHap660, 
Omni-1, Omni 2.5 or Omni Express bead chips48. SNPs were excluded if they had (i) yield 
<95%, (ii) MAF <1% in the population or (iii) significant deviation from Hardy–Weinberg 
equilibrium (HWE) (P<0.001), (iv) if they produced an excessive inheritance error rate (over 
0.001) or (v) if there was substantial difference in allele frequency between chip types (from 
just a single chip if that resolved all differences, but from all chips otherwise). All samples 
with a call rate below 97% were excluded from the analysis. Using genealogic information, 
the sequence variants were imputed into 294,212 un-typed relatives of chip-typed 
individuals to further increase the sample size for association analysis and increased the 
power to detect associations. The study was approved by the Data Protection Commission of 
Iceland and the National Bioethics Committee of Iceland. All subjects gave their written 
informed consent.
Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS): WGHS derives from the 23,294 Women’s Health 
Study (WHS) European ancestry participants who provided baseline blood samples. They 
represent approximately 72% of the 39,876 initially healthy female healthcare professionals, 
aged >45 years at baseline, who participated in a randomized, placebo controlled trial of 
aspirin and vitamin E in primary prevention over 10 years of incident CVD. The Institutional 
Review Board of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, approved all analyses49. 
Genotyping was performed using the HumanHap300 Duo “+” platform (Illumina, San 
Diego, CA) with the Infinium II protocol. For quality control, all samples were required to 
have successful genotyping using the BeadStudio v.3.3 software (Illumina, San Diego, CA) 
for at least 98% of the SNPs. The subset of 23,294 women had self-reported European 
ancestry that could be verified by multidimensional scaling analysis of identity-by-state 
using 1,443 ancestry informative markers in PLINK v.1.06. In the final dataset, a total of 
339,596 SNPs were retained with: MAF >1%, call rate >90%, and HWE P<10-6. Genotypes 
for a total of 30,052,423 (autosomes) + 1,264,493 (X) SNPs were imputed from the

 experimental genotypes and phase information from the 1000G phase I v.3 release (March 
2012) ALL panel using MaCH (v. 1.0.16) and Minimac (release 5/29/2012). 332,927 
genotyped SNPs that were selected by HWE P>10-6 but unrestricted by MAF could be 
reconciled with the 1000G ALL panel and were used for imputation.
Genetic correlations
Genetic correlations (rg) were calculated between puberty timing, AFS, AFB and 44 other 
complex traits/diseases in publicly-available datasets using LD Score Regression22 (see 
URLs). Genome-wide SNP association were also generated in UK Biobank for the following 
traits: number of children, childlessness, number of sexual partners, smoking status, alcohol 
intake, years of education, risk taking propensity, suffering from nerves, irritability, 
happiness, and intelligence. Details of these phenotypes are described in Table S15. A 
conservative Bonferroni corrected P-value threshold of P<1.1×10-3 [=0.05/44] was used to 
define significant associations.
Mendelian Randomization
Mendelian randomization is an analytical method to infer the likely causal unconfounded 
causal relationship between an exposure trait and an outcome. It is considered to be more 
accurate than estimate causal , using genetic variants that are associated with the exposure 
trait and do not influence the outcome by other unrelated biological pathways 
(‘pleiotropy’)21. We calculated using weighted allele scores from SNP genotypes at signals 
robustly associated with each modelled exposure as genetic instrumental variables for those 
traits. SNP genotypes were based on reported GWAS for adult height50, BMI27, puberty 
timing19, schizophrenia51, skin freckling and hair colour25, or from the current GWAS for 
AFS in UK Biobank. To avoid bias, outcomes were tested in datasets (UK Biobank, 
deCODE, WGHS or publicly-available datasets) that were independent of the discovery 
GWAS for each exposure. The associations with weighted allele scores were scaled to 
indicate the causal effect of a one SD change in the normalised exposure variable (Table S6).
Pathway analyses and functional insight of SNPs
Meta-Analysis Gene-set Enrichment of variaNT Associations (MAGENTA - https://
www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/magenta/) was used to test the full genome-wide discovery 
dataset for genetic associations with the biological pathways defined by Gene ontology, 
PANTHER, KEGG and Ingenuity. MAGENTA implements a gene set enrichment analysis 
(GSEA) based approach, where each gene in the genome is mapped to a single index SNP 
with the lowest P-value within a 110 kb upstream, 40 kb downstream window. This P-value, 
representing a gene score, is then corrected in a regression model for confounding factors 
such as gene size, SNP density and LD-related properties. Genes within the HLA-region 
were excluded from analysis due to difficulties in accounting for gene density and LD 
patterns. Each mapped gene in the genome is then ranked by its adjusted gene score. At a 
given significance threshold (95th and 75th percentiles of all gene scores), the observed 
number of gene scores in a given pathway, with a ranked score above the specified threshold 
percentile, is calculated. This observed statistic is then compared to 1,000,000 randomly 
permuted pathways of identical size. This generates an empirical GSEA P-value for each 
pathway. Significance was determined when an individual pathway reached a false discovery

 rate (FDR) <0.05 in either analysis. In total, 3216 pathways were tested for enrichment of 
multiple modest associations with AFS.
Each AFS-associated locus was annotated for possible genomic functions using ENCODE 
and Epigenome Roadmap project data in HaploReg v4.152.
