Objective: The goal of this study was to determine whether the reduction in cancer risk after bariatric
surgery is due to weight loss.
Methods: A retrospective matched cohort study of patients undergoing bariatric surgery was conducted
using data from a large integrated health insurance and care delivery system with five sites in four states.
The study included 18,355 bariatric surgery subjects and 40,524 nonsurgical subjects matched on age,
sex, BMI, site, and Elixhauser comorbidity index. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models examined
the relationship between weight loss at 1 year and incident cancer during up to 10 years of follow-up.
Results: The study identified 1,196 cases of incident cancer. The average 1-year postsurgical weight
loss was 27% among patients undergoing bariatric surgery versus 1% in matched nonsurgical patients.
Percent weight loss at 1 year was significantly associated with a reduced risk of any cancer in adjusted
models (HR 0.897, 95% CI: 0.832-0.968, P 5 0.005 for every 10% weight loss) while bariatric surgery
was not a significant independent predictor of cancer incidence.
Conclusions: Weight loss after bariatric surgery was associated with a lower risk of incident cancer.
There was no apparent independent effect of the bariatric surgery itself on cancer risk that was inde-
pendent of weight loss.

Introduction
Obesity is a well-established risk factor for developing cancer and has
been estimated to contribute to 9.4% of all cancers in women and 3.5% of
all cancers in men within North America (1,2). Obesity is associated with
15% to 20% of all cancer deaths (3). Multiple biologic mechanisms have
been proposed for the link between obesity and cancer, including
increased insulin and insulin-like growth factors (4), increased estradiol
(5-8), mechanical mechanisms (9), and inflammation (10). These biologic
mechanisms that are associated with obesity and lead to a rise in cancer
risk are potentially modifiable by weight loss. After weight loss by either
diet or exercise, adipose-tissue gene expression changes at 6 months for
both steroid-hormone metabolism and insulin-like growth factor signaling
(11). Additionally, over 60 studies have demonstrated that diet and exer-
cise decrease inflammatory biomarkers that may potentially decrease the
risk of cancer over time (12).
Two large studies examined the relationship between medical weight
loss and cancer. The first, a prospective cohort study of 21,707
women in the Iowa Women’s Health Study, demonstrated that a his-
tory of intentional weight loss of over 9 kg was associated with an
11% reduction in the risk of cancer (13) and that weight loss before
or after menopause conferred a reduction in the risk of postmeno-
pausal breast cancer (14). Additionally, The Nurse’s Health Study
demonstrated that a 10-kg weight loss was associated with a
decreased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (15).
Multiple studies have shown that bariatric surgery is associated with a
reduced risk of cancer (16-20). However, it remains unclear if the
reduction in cancer risk is related to bariatric surgery itself or the
weight loss induced by bariatric surgery. In the case of type 2 diabetes
remission following bariatric surgery, it has been proposed that bariat-
ric surgery may have beneficial effects on glycemic control that are
independent of weight loss and mediated by several factors, including
changes in gut hormones, bile acids, and the microbiome (21). Whether
there are similar surgery-specific mechanisms in the context of reduced
cancer incidence following surgery is unknown. It is possible that simi-
lar weight-independent effects of bariatric surgery impact cancer risk.

 The goal of this study was to determine whether the reduction in
cancer risk is entirely related to weight loss or if there is evidence
for an effect of bariatric surgery that is independent of weight loss.
It is hypothesized that there is an independent effect of bariatric sur-
gery after accounting for the amount of weight loss after surgery.
Methods
A retrospective observational matched cohort study was conducted
using data from electronic health record databases and registries
from five Kaiser Permanente regions, representing a large integrated
health insurance and care delivery systems with five study sites:
Kaiser Permanente (regions of Southern California, Northern Cali-
fornia, the Northwest [Oregon], Colorado, and Washington [formerly
Group Health Cooperative]. The cohort included individuals with
obesity who were enrolled in any of the above health plans between
January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2012. Follow-up extended
through 2014. Institutional review board approval, including waiver
of informed consent, was obtained at Kaiser Permanente Colorado,
and all other sites ceded review to the KP Colorado Institutional
Review Board.
Patients who underwent bariatric surgery were identified using CPT-
4 and ICD-9 codes for surgery between January 1 2005, and Decem-
ber 31, 2012. Of 33,141 patients identified to have had bariatric sur-
gery, 10,882 were excluded for not meeting study criteria: prior
bariatric surgery (902); not enrolled for 12 months prior to surgery
(3,339); older or younger than 18-79 years at time of surgery (152);
presurgical history of cancer (2,492); and without BMI measurement
within 12 months of surgery (3,997). Each of the remaining 22,259
bariatric surgery patients were then matched to patients who had
never had bariatric surgery using the following matching criteria:
Kaiser Permanente region; sex; birthdate within 1 year; BMI; and
Elixhauser comorbidity index (22). Nonsurgical patients were provi-
sionally matched to multiple surgical patients based upon region,
sex, and birthdate within 1 year. Potential matches were then
excluded if they had a prior cancer or if their BMI was not within
5% of the surgical patient’s. Each surgical patient was matched to 3
nonsurgical patients based on the smallest difference in Elixhauser
comorbidity index score when possible. If the Elixhauser difference
was 3 or greater, the matches were removed and returned to the
pool of potential matches. In a second phase of matching for those
surgical patients without three nonsurgical matches, the BMI match-
ing window was extended to 610% of the surgical patient’s BMI.
This second phase yielded 2.85% of the matches. After the final
matching process, only 62 surgical patients remained without a
match. Next, surgical patients and their nonsurgical matched patients
were eliminated from the final cohort if they did not have at least
18 months of follow-up time after the index date. The index date
was defined as the date of surgery for each surgical patient; for each
nonsurgical patient, the matched surgical patient’s surgery date was
assigned as the index date. Finally, patients were eliminated from
the final cohort if they did not have weight measurements within 12
months on each side of the 12-month follow-up.
Estimated percent weight loss was calculated for 1 year after surgery
for bariatric surgery patients or 1 year after the index date for non-
surgical matches using linear interpolation. Two recorded weights
for each patient were used, along with the dates on which the
weights were recorded. The two weights were the last one prior to
the 12-month post-index date and the first one following the 12-
month post-index date—that is, the two weights closest to 12
months after the index date. The estimated weight at 12 months
post-index date was then the linear interpolation across time
between the two recorded weights just described. The difference
between this estimated weight and the baseline weight (last pre-
index date weight) was then used to calculate percent weight lost
for each patient. The robustness of this method was supported by
the following results: The mean (SD) time between the recorded
weight prior to the 12-month follow-up was 2.8 (2.8) months, and
time to the weight following the 12 month follow-up was 2.3 (2.6)
months. In the surgical patients, the mean (SD) percent weight loss
at the first post-12-month weight measurement was 27.7% (9.9),
while the mean (SD) estimated 12-month percent weight loss was
27.3% (9.3). The similarity of these means that, on average, weight
was not declining much at or after 12 months post-surgery. The cor-
relation across patients between the 12-month estimated weight and
the first post-12-month measurement was 0.975, indicating that the
slow average weight decline around the 12-month post-surgery time
point was highly consistent across patients. Thus, at 12 months,
weight was declining only slightly among the surgery patients, and
the variability across patients in the weight slope at 12 months was
small. For the nonsurgical matches, the weight trajectories were flat,
and therefore not subject to appreciable methods variance when
comparing different methods of 12-month weight loss estimation.
Incident cancers were identified from Kaiser Permanente tumor
registries at each institution. Obesity-related cancers (breast [post-
menopausal], colon and rectum, corpus uteri, esophagus [adenocarci-
noma], gallbladder, gastric cardia, kidney [renal-cell], liver, menin-
gioma,
multiple myeloma,
ovary, pancreas and thyroid) were
defined based on evidence deemed sufficient for an association with
obesity according to a report by the International Agency for
Research on Cancer (23). All other cancers were considered not
associated with obesity.
To characterize the study sample, we calculated means, medians,
and frequencies for variables used as covariates in the Cox propor-
tional hazards models as well as other factors of interest. Subjects
with a history of bariatric surgery were compared to the matched
nonsurgical patients using standardized differences. Cox proportional
hazards models were used to examine the relationship between
weight loss at 1 year, bariatric surgery, and incident cancer. To
eliminate the potential for a reversed causal process in which cancer
might cause weight loss, patients’ time under observation was
started at 18 months post-surgery using only those patients who
were cancer free until that time. Separate models were estimated
predicting the development of any cancer, obesity-associated can-
cers, and nonobesity-associated cancers, with observations censored
at the diagnosis of cancers not of the type being predicted as well as
when patients became unenrolled in the health plan. Covariates used
in the adjusted models using all patients are listed where appropri-
ate. Adjusted analyses of either only surgery patients or only
matched nonsurgery patients employed the additional covariates of
those factors that had been used in the matching.
Because percent weight loss and bariatric surgery were highly col-
linear, hazard ratios (HR) for the risk of cancer for those receiving
bariatric surgery and those with no surgery were also estimated sep-
arately. For each outcome (all cancers, obesity-related cancers, and

 non-obesity-related cancers), both unadjusted models and nonparsi-
monious models adjusted for the covariates that potentially impact
cancer risk were estimated. We tested for linear interactions between
surgery status and weight loss in models containing only those two
main effects, as well as in the same models with covariates added.
This was done for all cancers and for obesity-related and non-

 obesity-related cancers. Within this set of models, we tested the pro-
portional hazards assumption by adding interactions between time
and each surgery status and weight loss, in simple models containing
only those factors. In those same models, the linearity of weight
loss effects was tested by adding to the models a quadratic weight
loss term. In the models estimated on surgery cases only or controls
only, tests of proportional hazards and linearity of weight loss were
tested by adding the necessary terms to models containing weight
loss only. Robust sandwich estimators were used to account for the
matching. The alpha for all tests was a two-tailed P 5 0.05, unad-
justed for multiple tests, and all analyses were performed using SAS
version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).
Results
The final matched cohort had 18,355 bariatric surgery patients and
40,524 nonsurgical matched patients. Over 80% were female with
an average age of 46 years. The two groups were well balanced on
both the presence of obesity-associated conditions and risk factors
for the development of cancer (Table 1). Overall, the average 1-
year weight loss was 27% among patients undergoing bariatric sur-
gery versus 1% in matched nonsurgical patients.
In Cox proportional hazards models that included both surgery status
and percent weight loss as predictors of cancer incidence, estimated
percent weight loss at 1 year was significantly associated with a
reduced risk of any cancer in the unadjusted model (HR 0.876, 95%
confidence interval [CI]: 0.812-0.946, P � 0.001 for every 10%
weight loss) and in the model adjusted for other covariates (HR
0.897, 95% CI: 0.832-0.968, P 5 0.005 for every 10% weight loss)
while bariatric surgery was not a significant independent predictor
in unadjusted or adjusted models (Table 2).
Kaplan-Meier curves show that the unadjusted rates of incident can-
cer differed for patients having bariatric surgery by the amount of
weight that was lost at 1 year (Figure 1). Those who lost the great-
est amount of weight had the fewest cancers.
Next, models for obesity-associated and nonobesity-associated can-
cers were examined separately, while including both surgical and
nonsurgical patients in the same model. For nonobesity-associated
cancers, estimated percent weight loss at one year was associated
with a reduced risk of cancer in both simple and adjusted Cox mod-
els, while bariatric surgery was not. For obesity-associated cancers
in unadjusted models, we found no significant association between
weight loss and cancer. In the adjusted models, bariatric surgery
was associated with a reduced risk of cancer when controlling for
weight loss, while estimated percent weight loss at 1 year was not
significantly associated with a reduction in cancer risk.
The weight change during the study period was significantly differ-
ent between patients who developed cancer and those who did not

 for patients who had bariatric surgery. Among surgical patients, esti-
mated weight loss at 1 year was less for those who developed cancer
compared to those who did not (24.4% vs. 27.4%; P � 0.001),
whereas among the nonsurgical matches, no differences in 1-year
estimated weight loss were observed between those who developed
cancer and those who did not (0.10% vs. 0.8%; P 5 0.47).
We also investigated the effect of weight loss separately in those
who underwent bariatric surgery and those who did not. In patients
who had bariatric surgery, estimated percent weight loss at 1 year
was significantly associated with a reduced risk of any type of can-
cer in both unadjusted (HR 0.797, 95% CI: 0.712-0.891, P � 0.001
for a 10% weight loss) and adjusted (HR 0.859, 95% CI: 0.764-
0.966, P 5 0.01 for a 10% weight loss) Cox models (Table 3). For
obesity-associated cancers, estimated percent weight loss at 1 year
was significantly associated with a reduced risk of cancer in unad-
justed (HR 0.831, 95% CI: 0.706-0.980, P 5 0.03 for a 10% weight
loss) but not in adjusted (HR 0.883, 95% CI: 0.743-1.050, P 5 0.16
for a 10% weight loss) Cox models. For cancers not associated with
obesity, estimated percent weight loss at 1 year was significantly
associated with a reduced risk of cancer in both unadjusted (HR
0.765, 95% CI: 0.656-0.892, P � 0.001 for a 10% weight loss) and
adjusted (HR 0.839, 95% CI: 0.717-0.983, P 5 0.03 for a 10%
weight loss) Cox models. For the matched nonsurgical patients, esti-
mated percent weight loss at 1 year did not significantly predict
cancer.
Discussion
In our current study, we find that cancer risk after bariatric sur-
gery appears to be closely associated with the amount of weight
loss achieved at one year. In adjusted models, the association
between bariatric surgery and cancer risk was explained by
weight loss and was not independently associated with surgery. In
the group having bariatric surgery, weight loss reduced the risk of
cancer overall and also among the subset of nonobesity-associated
cancers.
While previous work has shown that bariatric surgery reduces the
risk of obesity-associated cancers (16-20), we did not find statisti-
cally significant evidence in this study that the reduction of obesity-
associated cancers among bariatric surgery patients was associated
with weight loss.
For patients having bariatric surgery, for each 10% of weight loss
there was a 14% reduction in cancer risk. Thus, for the average bari-
atric patient who loses 27% of their weight at 1 year, the reduction
in cancer risk is 34% using the adjusted results (46% with the unad-
justed results). Among obesity matches who did not undergo bariat-
ric surgery, estimated weight loss was small (1% at 1 year) and was
not associated with a change in cancer risk.
Two other studies have examined the association between weight
loss after bariatric surgery and cancer risk. The first, a well-matched
prospective cohort study of more than 2,000 bariatric surgery cases,
found no association between amount of weight loss and cancer risk
using weight change during the first year following surgery (20).
Despite a mean follow-up of over 10 years, only 117 cancers
occurred in the surgery group. The second study, a retrospective
study of 2,943 patients having bariatric surgery, found that percent
total weight loss at 1 year was significantly less in the group that
developed cancer compared to the group that did not develop cancer
(27.8% vs. 31.2%) (24). Over the mean follow-up of 3.8 years, 54
patients developed cancer.
We also found some seemingly paradoxical results. For obesity-
associated cancers, weight loss was not associated with lower cancer
risk in our models that included both surgical patients and nonsurgi-
cal patients. This may be because surgery was included in the mod-
els. If surgery is removed from the model, percent weight loss is
highly associated with cancer risk, but it is impossible to tell with
this sample size if it is weight loss or surgery that is the important
predictor of obesity-associated cancer. Because the risk of obesity-
associated cancers was decreased compared to matched nonsurgical
patients, it suggests that there are either other mechanisms beyond
weight loss that are more important in mediating the risk or that
even small amounts of weight loss are enough to mitigate the risk

 of obesity-associated cancer. More research is needed to determine
the mechanism for obesity-associated cancers.
For nonobesity-associated cancers, we found a significant associa-
tion with weight loss. This suggests that the list of obesity-
associated cancers may need to be expanded (23), and the mecha-
nisms driving these associations may need to be further elucidated.
There are several limitations to the current study. Unmeasured dif-
ferences may exist between the bariatric surgery patients and the
matched nonsurgical patients. For example, bariatric surgery may
have motivated patients to make lifestyle changes that are associated
with a reduced risk of cancer. The amount of weight loss in the non-
surgical patients was very different from that in the bariatric surgery
patients. This made interpretation of the models including weight
loss and surgery difficult, as there was collinearity between weight
loss and surgery. We were unable to conduct sub-analyses for each
specific bariatric procedure due to small sample sizes for the non-
gastric bypass procedures. This is a limitation, as the different bari-
atric procedures may have differing effects on cancer risk.
Conclusion
In this large, multisite cohort of patients with severe obesity, weight
loss after bariatric surgery was associated with a lower risk of inci-
dent cancer. There was no apparent effect of bariatric surgery on
cancer risk that was independent of weight loss. This provides fur-
ther evidence to support the idea that substantial weight loss may
reduce cancer risk.O
