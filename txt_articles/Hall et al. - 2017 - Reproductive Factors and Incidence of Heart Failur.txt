Abstract
BACKGROUND—Reproductive factors reflective of endogenous sex hormone exposure might 
have an effect on cardiac remodeling and the development of heart failure (HF).
OBJECTIVES—This study examined the association between key reproductive factors and the 
incidence of HF.
METHODS—Women from a cohort of the Women’s Health Initiative were systematically 
evaluated for the incidence of HF hospitalization from study enrollment through 2014. 
Reproductive factors (number of live births, age at first pregnancy, and total reproductive duration 
[time from menarche to menopause]) were self-reported at study baseline in 1993 to 1998. We 
employed Cox proportional hazards regression analysis in age- and multivariable-adjusted models.
RESULTS—Among 28,516 women, with an average age of 62.7 ± 7.1 years at baseline, 1,494 
(5.2%) had an adjudicated incident HF hospitalization during an average follow-up of 13.1 years. 
After adjusting for covariates, total reproductive duration in years was inversely associated with 
incident HF: hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.99 per year (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.98 to 0.99 per 
year) and 0.95 per 5 years (95% CI: 0.91 to 0.99 per 5 years). Conversely, early age at first 
pregnancy and nulliparity were significantly associated with incident HF in age-adjusted models,

 but not after multivariable adjustment. Notably, nulliparity was associated with incident HF with 
preserved ejection fraction in the fully adjusted model (HR: 2.75; 95% CI: 1.16 to 6.52).
CONCLUSIONS—In postmenopausal women, shorter total reproductive duration was associated 
with higher risk of incident HF, and nulliparity was associated with higher risk for incident HF 
with preserved ejection fraction. Whether exposure to endogenous sex hormones underlies this 
relationship should be investigated in future studies.

Endogenous sex hormones present during a woman’s reproductive period prior to 
menopause may have unique effects on her lifetime risk of atherosclerosis, hypertension, 
cardiac remodeling, and heart failure (HF) (1,2). Two physiological phenomena affecting 
endogenous sex hormone levels during the reproductive period include menstrual cycling 
and pregnancy. The protective effects of menstrual cycles are frequently hypothesized to 
explain why premenopausal women have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
compared with postmenopausal women of similar age, although this is still a controversial 
hypothesis (2,3). Moreover, data suggest that women with early menopause have an elevated 
risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, and there are conflicting data as to whether 
early menopause also predicts HF (4–7).
In addition to menstrual cycling, pregnancy involves alterations in cardiovascular 
hemodynamics, fluid balance, inflammatory and thrombotic pathways, and exposure to 
endogenous sex hormones, all of which impart a variety of peripartum and postpartum risks 
to women (8–11). Previous analyses have suggested a relationship between reproductive 
factors, such as total number of pregnancies and number of live births, with the subsequent 
development of CVD, including HF (12–21). A variety of mechanisms have been proposed, 
but the relationship remains incompletely understood and is likely multifactorial. Notably, a 
higher number of pregnancies leading to live births has been associated with increases in left 
ventricular (LV) mass and end-diastolic volume, as well as with a decrease in LV ejection 
fraction, which may lead to HF development (18).
By comparison, infertility has also been associated with increased maternal cardiovascular 
risk: women who reported at least 5 years of infertility before having a successful pregnancy 
demonstrated a 19% higher incidence of CVD compared with women not reporting 
infertility (17). Consistent with these findings, an analysis of the Swedish population registry 
found a J-shaped relationship between a woman’s number of live births and her subsequent 
risk of CVD, finding that both nulliparous women and women with at least 5 live births had 
increased risk compared with women with 2 live births (16). A higher number of 
pregnancies correlates with an earlier age at first birth, which also has been demonstrated to 
be independently associated with higher risk for CHD (22). It is unclear to what extent 
socioeconomic factors may affect this risk (23).
To better characterize the relationship between reproductive factors and subsequent HF risk, 
we examined postmenopausal women in the WHI (Women’s Health Initiative) to test

 associations among total number of live births, age at first pregnancy lasting at least 6 
months, and total reproductive duration (time from menarche to menopause) with incident 
HF. Our hypotheses were that nulliparity and multiparity (>2 pregnancies) would be 
associated with an increased risk of HF, as would a younger age at first pregnancy and a 
shorter total reproductive duration.
METHODS
The design of WHI has been described previously (24,25). Briefly, a total of 161,808 women 
were enrolled in the observational study and clinical trial components from 1993 to 1998 in 
the United States. We studied the subset of 44,174 WHI participants included in the 
University of North Carolina (UNC) HF cohort, for whom HF outcomes were centrally 
adjudicated from enrollment through September 2014. This cohort includes all women 
randomized to the hormone trial component of WHI (n = 27,347) and all black participants 
(n = 11,880) and Hispanic participants (n = 4,947) from the other clinical trials and the 
observational study.
Figure 1 depicts the creation of our analytic sample. All women with pre-existing CVD (n = 
467), including CHD, HF, stroke, or myocardial infarction, were excluded from the analysis, 
as were women with missing data (n = 15,191). Of the remaining participants, 28,516 
women had completed menopause at enrollment and were included in the current analyses.
Baseline characteristics, including a detailed reproductive history, were obtained by 
interviews and questionnaires (24,25). Reproductive factors were defined as the age at first 
pregnancy lasting at least 6 months, total number of live births, and total reproductive 
duration (defined as the age at menarche subtracted from age at menopause). Selected 
covariates included age at screening, household income, education level, ethnicity, U.S. 
region, body mass index, hypertension (defined by self-report, systolic blood pressure $ 140 
mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg at screening, or use of antihypertensive 
medication), diabetes (defined by fasting glucose >126 mg/dl or use of diabetes medication), 
hyperlipidemia requiring the use of medication, smoking status, history of breast-feeding for 
at least 1 month, history of pregnancy loss, prior hysterectomy, and usage of oral 
contraception or menopausal hormone therapy.
Within the cohort, all confirmed cases of HF hospitalization and patient-reported 
development of HF, angina, or CVD during hospitalization were sent to trained physicians at 
UNC for adjudication. These physicians reviewed the HF hospitalization medical records 
and classified cases following the algorithm used in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities) study (26). Initial and subsequent hospitalizations were included, and 
information such as ejection fraction and diastolic dysfunction were included, when 
available, from the medical record. Cases were classified into 1 of the following 5 
categories: definite acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), possible ADHF, chronic 
stable HF, unclassifiable, or HF unlikely.
The primary outcome for this analysis was the time to development of a first hospitalization 
for definite or probable ADHF or newly diagnosed stable HF. Additional outcomes included

 the time to development of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (defined as 
EF <50%) and time to development of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction 
(HFpEF) (defined as EF $ 50%), analyzed individually. In the 90 cases where a participant 
developed both HFpEF and HFrEF during the analytic period, the 2 classes of HF outcomes 
were not considered mutually competing events.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Cox proportional hazards regression models, both age- and multivariable-adjusted, estimated 
associations among the number of live births, age at first pregnancy, and total reproductive 
duration with incident hospitalized HF, and with HFrEF and HFpEF individually. We tested 
the assumption of proportionality of hazards with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and we 
performed sensitivity analyses to test the competing influence of death during follow up. A p 
value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed with SAS 
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
In secondary analyses, we separately evaluated the individual determinants of reproductive 
duration-age at menarche and age at menopause-with incident HF hospitalization. We also 
investigated effect modification by race/ethnicity by including an interaction term crossing 
race/ethnicity with reproductive duration in the regression model.
Recognizing that 42% of women in our study sample reported a history of hysterectomy 
prior to enrollment (Table 1), we separately evaluated the incidence of our primary outcome 
among women with natural menopause (without history of hysterectomy or oophorectomy) 
and among women with surgical menopause (with history of hysterectomy and/or 
oophorectomy). In secondary sensitivity analyses, we evaluated the incidence of our primary 
outcome among women without oral contraceptive use or menopausal hormone therapy, and 
after adjusting for infertility.
RESULTS
Of the 44,174 women included in the UNC HF adjudication cohort, 28,516 women had no 
missing reproductive data, were free of prevalent CVD, and were included in the analysis 
(Figure 1). Baseline characteristics of this sample are presented in Table 1. The mean age at 
screening was 62.7 years, and the mean ages at menarche and menopause were 12.6 and 
47.1 years, respectively, with a mean total reproductive duration of 34.4 years. The average 
number of live births was 3.3.
The mean and median follow-up were 13.1 and 15.2 years, respectively. Minimum follow-up 
was 9 days and maximum follow-up was 19.6 years. There were 1,494 cases of incident 
adjudicated HF hospitalization, of which 505 were cases with HFrEF and 586 were cases 
with HFpEF. In the remaining 403 cases, ejection fraction was not available or was 
undetermined. There were 5,600 deaths during follow up: 827 deaths (15%) were preceded 
by HF events, including 271 with HFpEF, 204 with HFrEF, and 352 with undetermined 
ejection fraction.

 PRIMARY ANALYSES
Shorter total reproductive duration was associated with increased risk of HF, with an age-
adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.98 per year (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97 to 0.98 per 
year; p <0.0001) and a multivariable-adjusted HR of 0.99 per year (95% CI: 0.98 to 0.99 per 
year; p = 0.02). This equates to a 5-year adjusted HR of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91 to 0.99) (Table 
2, Central Illustration).
Younger age at first pregnancy (age <20 years) and nulliparity were associated with 
increased risk of incident HF in age-adjusted models (HR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.16 to 1.75; and 
HR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.07 to 3.03, respectively). However, these associations were not 
statistically significant after multivariable adjustment (younger age at first pregnancy HR: 
1.14; 95% CI: 0.91 to 1.43; nulliparity HR: 1.70; 95% CI: 0.95 to 3.03) (Table 2).
Shorter total reproductive duration was associated with increased risk of HFrEF in age-
adjusted models (HR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.97 to 0.99), but not after multivariable adjustment 
(Table 3). Nulliparity was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of HFpEF 
in both age-adjusted (HR: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.22 to 5.44) and multivariable-adjusted models 
(HR: 2.75; 95% CI: 1.16 to 6.52) (Table 4). This association remained significant in 
sensitivity analyses after additional adjustment for infertility (HR: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.24 to 
5.55). Early age at first pregnancy and shorter total reproductive duration were associated 
with increased risk of HFpEF in age-adjusted but not multivariable-adjusted models (Table 
4).
Sensitivity analyses considering death as a competing event were not materially different 
from the reported results (data not shown).
SECONDARY ANALYSES
Table 5 presents the HRs for the individual components of reproductive duration, age at 
menarche, and age at menopause, both for the entire sample and stratified by surgical versus 
natural menopause. The association between shorter reproductive duration and increased 
risk of incident HF was related to an earlier age at menopause (adjusted HR: 0.99 per 
additional year before menopause; 95% CI: 0.98 to 0.99 per additional year), and 
particularly among women with natural menopause (adjusted HR: 0.97 per year before 
natural menopause; 95% CI: 0.96 to 0.99 per year). There was no evidence of statistically 
significant effect modification by race/ethnicity (p = 0.13).
Early age at first pregnancy (age <20 years) was significantly associated with increased risk 
of HF hospitalization among women without a history of oral contraceptive or menopausal 
hormone therapy (Table 6) and among women with natural menopause (Table 7), but not 
surgical menopause (Table 8).
DISCUSSION
Overall, our study demonstrated an association between selected reproductive factors and 
incident HF. Specifically, a shorter total reproductive duration resulted in a modestly 
increased risk of any HF, likely driven by a younger age at menopause. Moreover, our

 findings suggested that the association between total reproductive duration and HF is more 
pronounced in women with natural menopause compared with surgical menopause. 
Additionally, nulliparity was associated with an increased risk of HFpEF, even after 
adjustment for cardiovascular and sociodemographic confounders. However, higher parity 
was not associated with HF risk.
SHORTER REPRODUCTIVE DURATION AND HF
Prior data have suggested that women with early menopause, and consequently a shorter 
reproductive period with fewer reproductive cycles and lower cumulative exposure to 
endogenous sex hormones, have an increased risk of CHD, stroke, and possibly HF (4–7). 
An analysis of the Framingham Heart Study population suggested that the increased CHD 
risk with early menopause may be influenced by a loss of the protective effects of 
endogenous sex hormones and an increase in thrombotic risk (27). Estrogens have beneficial 
effects on nitric oxide synthesis and signaling, coronary artery calcification, myocardial 
contractile reserve, insulin resistance, and lipid metabolism, and progesterone has been 
demonstrated to decrease blood pressure through vasodilation and decreased angiotensin-II 
vasoresponsiveness (2,28–33). Unfortunately, randomized trials of sex hormone 
supplementation have failed to uniformly support the hypothesis that cardiovascular 
protection can be restored with exogenous estrogen or estrogen/progesterone 
supplementation (1,2,30,34–36).
Our finding that a shorter total reproductive duration was associated with a modestly 
increased risk of HF, even after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and 
particularly among women with natural menopause, might be due to the increased CHD risk 
that accompanies early menopause. We did not demonstrate a significant association 
between a shorter reproductive period and HFrEF that would corroborate this hypothesis, but 
a substantial proportion of HF events had unknown ejection fraction (27%), suggesting that 
HFrEF was likely under-represented. Importantly, another analysis of the Framingham 
population raised the possibility of reverse causation, demonstrating that premenopausal 
CHD risk factors, including higher serum cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and weight, 
were each associated with earlier age at menopause (37). These findings warrant ongoing 
evaluation of the potential cardioprotective mechanisms of endogenous sex hormone 
exposure in women.
NUMBER OF PREGNANCIES LEADING TO LIVE BIRTHS AND HF
Our findings that nulliparity was associated with a higher risk of incident HFpEF were also 
consistent with prior data from the Swedish Population Registers, which suggested a J-
shaped association between the number of pregnancies and subsequent cardiovascular 
disease (including HF). We did not observe a statistically significant increased risk of 
HFpEF with higher numbers of live births in this study.
To our knowledge, the association between nulliparity and HFpEF has not been reported 
previously. The continuous ovulatory cycles uninterrupted by pregnancy that correlate with 
nulliparity have been reported to increase the risk of breast, ovarian, and uterine cancers 
(38), but are generally believed to be protective against adverse cardiac remodeling and

 diastolic dysfunction (39). We hypothesized that the association between nulliparity and 
HFpEF might be driven by the established association between infertility, a correlate of 
nulliparity, and CVD (17,40). Exact causes of infertility have not been closely examined in 
terms of their association with CVD, and a large cohort analysis did not implicate fertility 
therapy as a cause of subsequent cardiovascular disease (41). We repeated the analysis 
controlling for a reported history of infertility, and the association between nulliparity and 
HFpEF was still present (adjusted HR: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.24 to 5.55), suggesting that the 
association could not be explained by infertility. It remains possible that residual 
confounding by hypertension or sociodemographic factors associated with hypertension is 
still present, despite their inclusion as covariates in the regression model, and this 
association merits further investigation.
STUDY LIMITATIONS
The availability of reproductive data and adjudicated HF outcomes in the UNC HF cohort of 
WHI allowed us to uniquely evaluate the association between total reproductive duration and 
number of pregnancies. Only the first occurrence of HF hospitalization was included as an 
outcome in the initial WHI study, and details such as LV ejection fraction were not 
uniformly reported. We had a large sample size that was well represented along racial/ethnic, 
socioeconomic, and geographic lines. A substantial proportion of women in the cohort had 
missing reproductive data and were excluded from the analysis, which would likely diminish 
our power to identify true associations. We also relied upon self-reporting in determining our 
primary exposures and we did not have biomarker-confirmed menopause status. Additional 
information regarding pregnancy complications, such as pregnancy-induced hypertension, 
pre-eclampsia, and peripartum cardiomyopathy, would have been helpful and informative to 
include in the model, but were not available in the WHI cohort at the time of our analysis. A 
substantial percentage of HF cases had undetermined EF (27%), and more detailed 
echocardiographic findings or biomarkers, such as brain natriuretic peptide, would have 
been helpful to confirm the diagnoses. Finally, our decision to analyze HFpEF and HFrEF 
outcomes individually required additional statistical tests, and our results should be 
interpreted as hypothesis generating, with the need for corroboration in other populations. 
We did not account for multiple tests in determining statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we found that a shorter total reproductive duration was associated with higher 
risk of incident total HF hospitalization in postmenopausal women, and nulliparity was 
associated with higher risk of incident hospitalized HFpEF. Whether exposure to 
endogenous sex hormones underlies this relationship should be investigated in future studies.

 PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE
Postmenopausal women with longer reproductive duration have a lower risk of 
hospitalization for HF, and nulliparity is associated with a higher risk of developing 
HFpEF.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK
Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms linking endogenous sex 
hormone exposure during a woman’s reproductive years to cardiovascular risk after 
menopause.

 Figure 1. Creation of the Study Sample: WHI
After excluding patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and missing reproductive data, 
the study included 28,516 participants from the University of North Carolina (UNC) heart 
failure (HF) cohort of the WHI (Women’s Health Initiative).

 CENTRAL ILLUSTRATION. Reproductive Factors and Incidence of HF
We examined the association between key reproductive factors and incidence of heart failure 
(HF) in a cohort of the WHI (Women’s Health Initiative). Hazard ratios and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were adjusted for age at screening, household income, education level, 
ethnicity, U.S. region, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking 
status, breastfeeding, history of pregnancy Loss, prior hysterectomy, and usage of oral 
contraception or menopausal hormone therapy. In postmenopausaL women, shorter total 
reproductive duration was associated with a higher risk of incident HF, and nulliparity was 
associated with a higher risk for incident heart failure with preserved ejection fraction 
(HFpEF). *Per year. †Compared with women with 1 Live birth. ‡Age of first pregnancy 
Lasting at Least 6 months at <20 years of age compared with referent $ 30 years of age. 
HFrEF = heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.
