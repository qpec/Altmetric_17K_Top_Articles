SUMMARY
Do all animals sleep? Sleep has been observed in many vertebrates, and there is a growing body of 
evidence for sleep-like states in arthropods and nematodes [1–5]. Here we show that sleep is also 
present in Cnidaria [6–8], an earlier branching metazoan lineage. Cnidaria, along with 
Ctenophora, are the first metazoan phyla to evolve tissue-level organization and differentiated cell 
types, such as neurons and muscle [9–15]. In Cnidaria, neurons are organized into a non-
centralized radially symmetric nerve net [11,13,15–17] that nevertheless shares fundamental 
properties with the vertebrate nervous system: action potentials, synaptic transmission, 
neuropeptides, and neurotransmitters [15–20]. It was reported that cnidarian soft corals [21] and 
box jellyfish [22,23] exhibit periods of quiescence, a pre-requisite for sleep-like states, prompting 
us to ask if sleep is present in Cnidaria. Within Cnidaria, the upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea spp. 
displays a quantifiable pulsing behavior, allowing us to perform long-term behavioral tracking. 
Monitoring Cassiopea pulsing activity for consecutive days and nights revealed behavioral 
quiescence at night that is rapidly reversible, and a delayed response to stimulation in the 
quiescent state. When deprived of nighttime quiescence, Cassiopea exhibited decreased activity 
and reduced responsiveness to a sensory stimulus during the subsequent day, consistent with 
homeostatic regulation of the quiescent state. Together these results indicate that Cassiopea has a 
sleep-like state, supporting the hypothesis that sleep arose early in the metazoan lineage, prior to 
the emergence of a centralized nervous system.

 Understanding the phylogenetic roots of behaviors sheds light on evolutionary forces that shape 
them. Sleep has been observed in worms, flies, zebrafish, and mice. Nath et al. discover that 
jellyfish have a sleep-like state. This shifts the known root of sleep in the phylogenetic tree prior to 
the emergence of a centralized nervous system.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Three behavioral characteristics define a sleep state [6,7,24]: (1) behavioral quiescence, a 
period of decreased activity; (2) reduced responsiveness to stimuli during the quiescent state; 
and (3) homeostatic regulation of the quiescent state. Both behavioral quiescence and 
reduced responsiveness must be rapidly reversible to differentiate sleep-like states from 
other immobile states (e.g. paralysis or coma) and reduced responsiveness distinguishes 
sleep from quiet wakefulness. Homeostatic regulation results in a rebound response, i.e. a 
compensatory period of increased sleep following sleep deprivation. Here we asked whether 
the cnidarian jellyfish Cassiopea exhibits these behavioral characteristics.
Cassiopea are found throughout the tropics in shallow ocean waters and mudflats (Figure 1; 
[25,26]). They rarely swim and rather remain stationary with their bell on a surface, hence 
their name, the upside-down jellyfish (Figure 1B; Figure S1A; Movie S1; [25,26]). 
Cassiopea, like coral and sea anemones, have a photosynthetic obligate endosymbiote, 
Symbiodinium (Figure 1C). Cassiopea continuously pulse by relaxing and contracting their 
bell at a rate of about 1 pulse/second (Figure 1D). This pulsing behavior generates fluid 
currents that facilitate vital processes such as filter feeding, circulation of metabolites, 
expulsion of byproducts, and gamete dispersion [25,27]. The pulsing behavior is controlled 
by light and gravity sensing organs called rhopalia (Figure 1C; [11,13]). This stationary 
pulsing behavior makes Cassiopea a suitable jellyfish for behavioral tracking.
To track behavior in Cassiopea, we designed an imaging system (Figure S1C–F) for 
counting pulses of individual jellyfish over successive cycles of day and night, defined as a 
12-hour period when the light is on or off, respectively. As Cassiopea pulse, the relaxation 
and contraction of the bell causes a corresponding change in average pixel intensity, which 
was measured for each frame of the recording, producing a pulse-trace (Figure 1D). Pulse 
events were counted using the peak of the pulse-trace, and the inter-pulse interval (IPI) was 
calculated as the time between the peaks (Figure 1D; Figure S2).
We observed that Cassiopea pulse less at night than during the day (Figure 2; Data S1). To 
quantify this difference in pulsing frequency, we tracked the pulsing behavior of 23 jellyfish 
over 6 consecutive days and nights (Figure 2C). We define activity as the total number of 
pulses in the first 20 minutes of each hour. While individual jellyfish showed different basal 
activity levels (Figure 2C), all showed a large decrease in mean activity (~32%) at night (781 
± 199 pulses/20 min, mean ± s.d.) compared to the day (1155 ± 315 pulses/20 min, mean ± 
s.d.; Figure 2C,E). To determine if fast and slow pulsing jellyfish change their activity to a 
similar degree, we normalized activity of individual jellyfish by their mean day activity. 
Despite variations in basal activity, the relative change from day to night was similar 
between jellyfish (Figure 2D). Jellyfish activity decreased throughout the first 3–6 hours of 
the night, with the lowest activity occurring 6–12 hours after the day to night transition.

 Pulsing activity peaked upon feeding, occurring on the 4th hour of each day (Figure 2C,D). 
To ensure that day feeding does not cause the day-night behavioral difference, we tracked 
the activity of 16 jellyfish over three consecutive days and nights without feeding and 
observed results consistent with those including feeding (Figure 2F,G; Figure S3D). These 
results demonstrate that Cassiopea have a quiescent state during the night. To test the 
reversibility of this nighttime quiescent state we introduced a food stimulus at night, which 
transiently increased activity to daytime levels (Figure S3E). The nighttime quiescent state 
in Cassiopea is thus rapidly reversible, consistent with a sleep-like behavior.
To better understand the nighttime quiescence, we compared day and night pulse-traces of 
individual jellyfish. The day and night pulse-traces of one representative jellyfish are shown 
in Figure 2A. During the night, the IPI is typically longer than during the day (Figure 2A,B; 
Data S1; Figure S3A). Two features contribute to this lengthening of the IPI: (1) the mode of 
the IPI distribution is longer at night than during the day, and (2) night pulsing is more often 
interrupted by pauses of variable length. These pauses are seen as a tail in the IPI frequency 
distribution (Figure 2B: 95th percentile of night IPI frequency distribution (gray) is 13.9 s). 
Such long pauses are rarely seen during the day (Figure 2B: 95th percentile of day IPI 
frequency distribution (yellow) is 2.5 s). This pause behavior may be analogous to long rest 
bouts observed in Drosophila and zebrafish, which are suggested to be periods of deep 
quiescence with reduced responsiveness to stimuli [1,28].
To test whether Cassiopea exhibit reduced responsiveness to stimuli during their nighttime-
quiescent state, we designed an experiment to deliver a consistent arousing stimulus to the 
jellyfish. We observed in our nursery that Cassiopea prefer staying on solid surfaces as is 
found in nature. If Cassiopea are released into the water column, they quickly reorient and 
move to the bottom of the tank. We used placement into the water column as a stimulus to 
compare responsiveness during the night versus the day. Cassiopea were put inside a short 
PVC pipe with a screen bottom (Figure 3A). This was lifted to a fixed height, held for 5 min 
to allow the jellyfish to acclimate, and then rapidly lowered, which placed the jellyfish free-
floating into the water column. We then scored the time it took for the jellyfish to first pulse 
and the time to reach the screen bottom (Figure 3A; Star Methods). At night, the jellyfish 
showed an increase in the time to first pulse and the time to reach bottom, compared to day 
(time to first pulse day: 2.1 ± 0.9 s versus night: 5.9 ± 4.0 s, and the time to reach bottom 
day: 8.6 ± 2.9 s versus night: 12.0 ± 3.2 s, mean ± s.d.; n = 23 animals) (Figure 3B,C). This 
increased latency in response to stimulus indicates that Cassiopea have reduced 
responsiveness to stimulus during the night.
To determine if the increased latency at night is rapidly reversible, a second drop was 
initiated within 30 s of the first drop, that is, after the jellyfish have been aroused. 
Reversibility was tested during both the day and night for 23 jellyfish. During the night, 
there is a large decrease in the time to first pulse and time to reach the bottom, after the 
second drop when compared to the first drop (Figure 3D,E). During the day and night, the 
time to first pulse and time to bottom after the second drop were indistinguishable, 
demonstrating that after perturbation, animals have similar arousal levels during the day and 
night. These results indicate that Cassiopea have rapidly reversible reduced responsiveness 
to a stimulus during the night.

 To test whether Cassiopea nighttime quiescence is homeostatically regulated, we deprived 
jellyfish of behavioral quiescence for either 6 or 12 hours using a mechanical stimulus 
(Figure 4). The stimulus consisted of a brief (10 s) pulse of water every 20 min, which 
caused a transient increase in pulsing activity (Movie S2). This increase in pulsing activity 
lasts for approximately 5 min after the 10 s pulse of water. Thus, the perturbation disrupts 
quiescence for approximately 25% of the perturbation period (either 6 hours or 12 hours). 
When the perturbation was performed during the last 6 hours of the night (Figure 4A), we 
observed a significant decrease in activity (~12%) during the first 4 hours of the following 
day relative to the pre-perturbation day (mean of first 4 hours of pre-perturbation day: 1146 
± 232 pulses/20 min compared to post-perturbation day: 1008 ± 210 pulses/20 min, mean ± 
s.d.; n = 30 animals; Figure 4C). This period of decreased activity is due to both decreased 
pulsing frequency (increased mode of IPI-length) and increased pause length (increase in the 
IPI-length 95th percentile) (Figure S4B,C). This result is consistent with an increased sleep-
drive after sleep deprivation. After a single day of decreased activity, the jellyfish return to 
baseline levels of day and night activity. Similar results were observed after an entire night 
of perturbation (12 hours; Figure 4D), with a large decrease in activity (~17%) throughout 
the following day (mean of 12 hours of pre-perturbation day: 1361 ± 254 pulses/20 min 
compared to post-perturbation day: 1132 ± 263 pulses/20 min, mean ± s.d.; n = 16 animals; 
Figure 4F). The decrease in activity caused by the 12-hour perturbation was larger than that 
of the 6-hour perturbation, indicating that the amount of sleep rebound is dependent on the 
level of sleep deprivation. During periods of decreased activity after either the 6-hour or 12-
hour perturbation, we also observed increased response latency to a sensory stimulus (Figure 
S4A), indicating a sleep-like state.
If the reduced activity following nighttime perturbation is due to sleep deprivation rather 
than muscle fatigue, applying the perturbation during the day, when Cassiopea are much less 
quiescent, should not result in reduced activity. To distinguish between sleep deprivation and 
muscle fatigue, we performed the 6- or 12-hour mechanical stimulus experiments during the 
day (Figure 4B,E). We observed no significant difference between pre- and post-perturbation 
activity levels (Figure 4C,F), indicating that the rebound response is specific to deprivation 
of nighttime quiescence. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Cassiopea have a 
nighttime-quiescent state that is homeostatically controlled.
In many animals sleep is regulated by both homeostatic and circadian systems [29], but this 
is not always the case [4–7,30]. For instance, the nematode C. elegans exhibits a 
developmentally regulated sleep state, and adult C. elegans show a non-circadian stress-
induced-sleep state [4,5,31]. A fully functioning circadian system is also not essential for 
sleep to occur; animals with null mutations of circadian rhythm genes still sleep, though 
sleep timing is altered [30]. To test if nighttime quiescence in Cassiopea is regulated by a 
circadian rhythm, we first entrained the jellyfish for one week in a normal 12:12-hour light/
dark cycle, and then shifted them to constant lighting conditions for 36 hours. We tested 
low- (~0.5 Photosynthetic Photon Flux [PPF]), mid- (~100 PPF), and full-intensity (~200 
PPF) light, as well as dark (Figure S4D,E). If jellyfish activity is regulated by a circadian 
rhythm, cycling activity should persist in the absence of entraining stimuli, such as light. We 
observed no circadian oscillation of jellyfish activity under any of the constant light 
conditions (Figure S4D). However, we do observe circadian oscillation of activity in

 constant dark conditions (Figure S4E). This result suggests that the quiescent state may be 
under circadian regulation.
Cassiopea display the key behavioral characteristics of a sleep-like state: a reversible 
quiescent state with reduced responsiveness to stimuli and both homeostatic and possibly 
circadian regulation. To our knowledge, our finding is the first example of a sleep-like state 
in an organism with a diffuse nerve net [7,8], suggesting that this behavioral state arose prior 
to the evolution of a centralized nervous system. Though at least 600 million years of 
evolution separate cnidarians from bilaterians [9–16], many aspects of the nervous system 
are conserved, including neuropeptides and neurotransmitters [15–20]. One such conserved 
molecule, melatonin [32], promotes sleep in diurnal vertebrates, including zebrafish [33] and 
humans [34], and induces quiescence in invertebrates [35]. We observed that melatonin 
induces a reversible decrease in activity in Cassiopea during the day in a concentration-
dependent manner (Figure S4F–H), suggesting that melatonin has a conserved quiescence-
inducing effect in Cassiopea. Pyrilamine, a histamine H1 receptor antagonist that induces 
sleep in vertebrates [36], also induces concentration-dependent quiescence in Cassiopea 
(Figure S4F). These results suggest that at least some mechanisms involved in vertebrate 
sleep may be conserved in Cassiopea.
Although future studies are required to test whether other cnidarians sleep, field studies 
showing behavioral quiescence, diel vertical migration, and swimming speeds that vary with 
diel period [21,22,23,37] suggest that a sleep-like state may not be specific to Cassiopea. A 
cnidarian sleep-like state could result from either divergent or convergent evolution. The 
observation of behaviorally and mechanistically conserved sleep-like states across the 
animal kingdom [6,7] strongly supports the possibility for an early rooted sleep state rather 
than many instances of convergent evolution. It has been hypothesized that sleep has 
multiple functions, including synaptic homeostasis, regulation of neurotransmitters, repair of 
cellular damage, removal of toxins, memory consolidation and energy conservation [7], 
although the ancestral role and selective advantage of sleep remains elusive. Our discovery 
of a sleep-like state in an ancient metazoan phylum suggests that the ancestral role of sleep 
is rooted in basic requirements that are conserved across the animal kingdom. The ancestral 
function of sleep may be revealed by further study of early branching metazoa.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Cassiopea spp. medusae used in this study were originally collected from the Florida Keys. 
For the majority of the experiments, a collection of multiple Cassiopea species were used 
(Figure S1A,B). For the experiments shown in Figure S4A,E,F a young (2–4 months old) 
clonal population of medusa were used (Cassiopea xamachana). This clonal polyp line was 
generated in Monica Medina’s lab at Pennsylvania State University.

 Cassiopea were reared in artificial seawater (ASW, Instant Ocean, 30–34 ppt) at pH 8.1–8.3, 
26–28°C with a 12-hour day/night cycle. During the day, 450 and 250 W light sources were 
used to generate 200–300 PPF (Photosynthetic Photon Flux, a measurement of light power 
between 400 and 700 nm). To limit waste buildup, the Cassiopea aquarium was equipped 
with a refugium (Chaetomorpha algae aquaculture), a protein skimmer (Vertex Omega 
Skimmer), carbon dosing bio-pellets (Bulk Reef Supply), activated carbon in a media reactor 
(Bulk Reef Supply), and a UV sterilizer (Emperor Aquatics 25 W). Waste products were 
kept at or below the following levels: 0.1 ppm ammonia, 5 ppb phosphorus, 0 ppm nitrite, 
and 0 ppm nitrate.
Cassiopea were fed daily with brine shrimp (Artremia nauplii, Brine Shrimp Direct) 
enriched with Nannochloropsis algae (Reed Mariculture), and they were fed oyster roe once 
per week (Reed Mariculture). Cassiopea were group housed in a 60 gallon holding tank. 
Animals were randomly assigned to experimental groups. Medusae between 3–6 cm in 
diameter were used for experiments.
Cassiopea Genotyping—Cassiopea is a genus with many species that have not been 
classified. All of our experiments were performed with Cassiopea spp. of a range of sizes, 
ages, sex and morphologies (Figure S1A,B). To assess the diversity of Cassiopea spp. within 
our population we genotyped several animals by amplification and sequencing of the 
Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI). Genomic DNA extractions were performed as 
described [38]. Jellyfish fragments, about 2 mm of tissue from the tentacles, were placed in 
400 μL DNA extraction buffer (50% w/v guanidinium isothiocyanate; 50 mM Tris pH 7.6; 
10 μM EDTA; 4.2% w/v sarkosyl; 2.1% v/v β-mercaptoethanol). Samples were incubated at 
72°C for 10 min, centrifuged at 16,000 g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatant mixed with 
an equal volume of isopropanol and incubated at −20°C overnight. The DNA was 
precipitated by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 15 min and the DNA pellet washed in 70% 
ethanol and resuspended and stored in water.
Amplification of COI was performed using primers designed by Folmer et al. [39], which 
amplify a ~710 base pair fragment of COI across the broadest array of invertebrates. COI 
primers:
LCO1490 forward primer: 5′-ggtcaacaaatcataaagatattgg-3′
HC02198 reverse primer: 5′-taaacttcagggtgaccaaaaaatca-3′
Amplifications were performed under the following PCR conditions: 2 min at 92°C, 30 
cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 45 s, with a final 72°C extension for 7 
min. Amplification products were then TOPO-cloned using OneTaq (NEB) and sequenced.
Multiple sequence alignment of Cassiopea spp. COI sequences were generated using Clustal 
Omega software. Sequences were aligned with each other (see Figure S1B), and to the 
previously identified cryptic species Cassiopea ornata, Cassiopea andromeda, and Cassiopea 
frondosa [26]. The level of identity between these sequences is presented in Figure S1B. Of 
the 15 Cassiopea spp. sequenced there were 8 identical COI sequences and 7 COI sequences 
with 45–90% identity.

 METHODS DETAILS
Cassiopea behavioral tracking—Individual jellyfish were placed into 700 mL square 
clear plastic containers (cubbies), with white sand bottoms, in 35 L (10 gallon) glass tanks 
(Figure S1C–F). Eight containers can fit in each tank, so eight jellyfish can be 
simultaneously recorded per tank. Tanks were housed inside Sterilite utility cabinets (65 cm 
W × 48 cm L × 176 cm H) with a door to eliminate ambient light in the recording setup. 
During the 12-hour day (lights on) tanks were illuminated with 24-inch florescent lamps, 
each containing four florescent bulbs that provide a combination of wavelengths optimized 
for photosynthesis in water: two 24 W, 6000 K Mid-day lights, and two 24 W Actinic lights 
(Giesemann), which combined provided 200–300 PPF. During the 12-hour night (lights off) 
low-intensity red-LEDs were used to illuminate jellyfish to enable visualization. For all 
jellyfish recordings we used Unibrain 501b cameras above the tank running Firei software 
capturing at 15 frames per second. Camera aperture and Firei settings were adjusted to 
increase the contrast between jellyfish and background. Recordings were saved directly onto 
hard drives.
Jellyfish were acclimated in the recording tank in their cubbies for 2–3 days before starting 
recordings. 24-hour recordings were taken for successive days (7 am – 7 pm) and nights (7 
pm – 7 am), unless otherwise indicated. Cassiopea were fed each day at 10:30 am, 3.5 hours 
after the lights turn on. Each jellyfish received 5 mL of 16 g/L brine shrimp. For each 
circadian rhythm experiment a different light condition was left on for 36-hours: dark 
conditions, low-intensity light conditions (an array of white-LED lights, 0–0.5 PPF), mid-
intensity light conditions (two 24 W, 6000 K Mid-day lights, 75–150 PPF), or full light 
conditions (two 24 W, 6000 K Mid-day lights, and two 24 W Actinic lights, 200–300 PPF). 
For 6-hour and 12-hour rebound experiments the mechanical stimulus (Movie S2) was 
applied for 10 s every 20 min.
All analysis was done using open-source packages in the SciPy ecosystem [40–42]. To 
monitor jellyfish activity, pulsing information was extracted from the individual frames of 
each recording. Approximately 648,000 frames were collected every 12 hours. To quantify 
pulsing activity, we processed the first 18,000 frames of every hour (20 min). As Cassiopea 
pulse, the relaxation and contraction of the bell causes a corresponding change in average 
pixel intensity. To measure this change in average pixel intensity we drew a rectangular 
region of interest (ROI) around each jellyfish (Figure 1D; Figure S1F). A user manually 
selected a ROI around each of the eight jellyfish in the first and last of the 18,000 frames. 
This was done so that the selected ROI accounts for any movement of the jellyfish. To 
control for noise from oscillations in ambient lighting, we perform background subtraction 
using a similarly sized ROI containing no jellyfish.
We analyzed pixel intensity data, and identified pulse events and inter-pulse intervals (IPI) in 
a four-step process. Step 1: Gaussian smoothing of the mean intensity over time to eliminate 
high frequency oscillations (Figure S2A). This smoothed trace was used to account for large 
movements in the mean intensity due to jellyfish translational movement within the selected 
ROI. Step 2: Normalization of the mean intensity values with the max mean intensity and 
the smoothed mean intensity:

 Where Traw is the raw intensity trace, Tsmooth is the smoothed trace generated in Step 1, 
Tmax is maximum intensity across the raw trace, and n is the index of each frame of the 
recording. Step 3: find the indices (time) of local maxima and minima in the normalized 
trace. Because of noise in the pulsing trace there is a high rate of false positives when 
finding local maxima and minima (Figure S2B). We have used a set of criteria to identify a 
true pulse event from the local maxima and local minima. Step 4: identifying pulses from 
local maxima and minima (Figure S2C). A local maximum can be defined as a pulse peak if 
it meets two criteria. First, it must be above a set threshold (to eliminate local maxima due to 
noise in pause regions of the pulse trace). Second, it must be above a set distance from the 
next local maxima (to prevent double counting of a single pulse). The standard deviation of 
the Gaussian smoothing, the threshold level, and the minimum distance between pulses can 
all be changed from one jellyfish to another. For all data analysis these parameter values 
were optimized to quantify pulsing events for each animal.
We calculated the total number of pulses and the IPI for each 20-min time bin. With some 
jellyfish the difference in pixel intensity from the contracted to non-contracted state was not 
big enough to easily identify pulsing above the noise. These jellyfish were excluded from 
analysis. During the 20-min recordings jellyfish would occasionally move out of the selected 
ROI. We would then exclude that 20-min recording for that jellyfish from the analysis. In 
compiling data to generate activity versus time plots we excluded jellyfish that we could not 
analyze for more than three 20-min recordings during a 12-hour day or night period.
For the arousal assay we designed an experiment to systematically test this sensory 
responsiveness. Cassiopea respond to being placed in the water column by rapidly orienting 
themselves and moving towards a stable surface. For the experimental system, Cassiopea 
were placed inside a 20 cm tall, 12 cm diameter, PVC pipe with a 53 m filter screen bottom, 
called a Cassiopea dropper (CD). The experiment consists of four steps, as seen in the four 
panels in Figure 3A. Step 1, the jellyfish were placed on the screen bottom of the CD, which 
was positioned two cm below the water surface (hL) and were acclimated for five min. At 
night jellyfish took less than five min to return to quiescence after being placed in the CD. 
Step 2, the CD was then “dropped” to a set depth (18 cm from the surface, hD). This action 
leaves the jellyfish free-floating, two cm below the water surface. Step 3, the time to first 
pulse was measured. Step 4, the time to reach bottom was measured. To determine if the 
nighttime arousal latency is reversible, a second drop experiment was performed within 30 s 
of the initial drop. The CD was returned to two cm below the water surface, but instead of 
waiting for five min, steps 2 and 3 were performed immediately. Time to first pulse and time 
to bottom are not completely independent measures, though there is also not a perfect 
correlation. A jellyfish could pulse quickly but be delayed in reaching the bottom due to, for 
example, inactivity after the first pulse.

 Cassiopea staining and imaging—Actin was stained using Alexa Flour 488-Phalloidin 
(ThermoFisher A12379). Jellyfish were anesthetized in ice-cold 0.8 mM menthol/ASW, and 
then fixed in 4% formaldehyde on ice for 45 min. Fixed jellyfish were permeabilized in 
0.5% Triton/PBS for 2 hours and blocked using 3% BSA for 1 hour. They were then 
incubated in 1:100 Phalloidin solution in 0.5% Triton/PBS, for 18–24 hours in the dark at 
4°C [43]. Stained jellyfish were mounted in refractive index matching solution [44] and 
imaged using a LSM 780 confocal microscope (Zeiss).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The following statistical tests were used: two-sided paired Student’s t-tests, two-sided 
unpaired Student’s t-tests, and two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni posttest. We performed 
D’Agostino’s omnibus K2 normality test on all data sets to assess whether or not to reject 
the null hypothesis that all values were sampled from a population that follows a Gaussian 
distribution. For paired values, we tested if the pairs were sampled from a population where 
the difference between pairs follows a Gaussian distribution. Experimental groups that were 
statistically compared were tested for equal variance. The normality tests showed that all 
datasets were approximately Gaussian distributed with the exception of the time to first 
pulse arousal data. The time to first pulse data also showed grounds for rejecting the null 
hypothesis that there was equal variance between experimental groups. Tests of the log 
transformed time to first pulse data showed that the transformed data was approximately 
Gaussian distributed with equal variance between experimental groups, validating the use of 
standard two-way ANOVA and unpaired t-tests on the transformed data. Statistical tests 
were performed using either statistical functions from the SciPy ecosystem or GraphPad 
Prism (version 6.04 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA, 
www.graphpad.com). No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. For 
these experiments we performed at least two laboratory replicates within our recording 
setup, which is limited to 8 jellyfish. Investigators were not blinded to allocation during 
experiments and outcome assessment. No specific method for randomization was used.

 Highlights
-
Cassiopea jellyfish exhibit reversible behavioral quiescence during the night
-
Cassiopea show reduced responsiveness to stimuli during their quiescent state
-
The nighttime quiescence is regulated by both homeostatic and circadian 
systems
-
Pharmacological studies show evidence of molecular conservation of sleep 
regulation

 Figure 1. The pulsing behavior of the upside-down jellyfish, Cassiopea spp., is trackable
(A) Phylogenetic tree schematic highlighting animals in which sleep behavior has been 
described, the presence of neurons (tan), and the emergence of a centralized nervous system 
(dark blue). See boxed key. (B) An image of Cassiopea. (C) Higher magnification view of 
Cassiopea with labeled actin-rich muscle (phalloidin stain; cyan), autofluorescent 
Symbiodinium (yellow), and a rhopalia, the sensory organ that controls pulsing, which is 
free of Symbiodinium. (D) As Cassiopea pulse the relaxation and contraction of the bell 
causes a corresponding change in average pixel intensity. Pulsing behavior was tracked by 
measuring this change in pixel intensity within the region of interest. (top) Representative 
frames and corresponding normalized pixel intensities for one pulse event. The local 
maxima in the pulse-trace was used to count pulse events. (bottom) A 10-second recording 
of one jellyfish shows multiple pulsing events. The inter-pulse interval (IPI) was calculated 
as the time between the maxima. See Figure S1, Figure S2, Movie S1.

 Figure 2. Continuous tracking of Cassiopea reveals pulsing quiescence at night
(A) Pulsing-traces for individual jellyfish during day and night over 120 s. (B) The 
distribution of IPI length for a 12-hour day and a 12-hour night for the same jellyfish shown 
in A. Tick marks below the distribution show each IPI length during the day and night. This 
highlights the long-pause events, which are more common at night (Figure S3A; Data S1). 
(C-G) Each blue line corresponds to a single jellyfish. The black line indicates the mean 
activity of all jellyfish. Dark gray shading indicates night periods. Dark tick marks on the x-
axis indicate time of feeding. (C) Baseline activity (pulses/20 min) of 23 jellyfish tracked for 
six days from four laboratory replicates. (D) Normalized baseline activity for jellyfish shown 
in C, where each jellyfish is normalized by their mean day activity. (E) Mean day activity 
versus mean night activity for each jellyfish over the six-day experiment shown in C. Two-
sided paired t-test, day versus night, P = 6×10−9. (F) Normalized baseline activity without 
feeding of 16 jellyfish tracked over three days from two laboratory replicates, where each 
jellyfish is normalized by its mean day activity. (G) Mean day activity versus mean night 
activity for each jellyfish over the three-day experiment shown in F. Two-sided paired t-test, 
day versus night, P =10−5. ***P<10−3. See Figure S3.

 Figure 4. Homeostatic rebound in Cassiopea
Each blue line corresponds to a single jellyfish. The black line indicates the mean activity of 
all jellyfish. Dark gray shading indicates night periods. Maroon shading indicates 
perturbation periods with 10 s water pulses every 20 min. Jellyfish were exposed to different 
perturbation lengths (6 or 12 hours) at different times (day or night). The normalized activity 
of all jellyfish tracked over multiple days is plotted. Maroon horizontal lines show the mean 
activity of pre-perturbation day (solid) and pre-perturbation night (dashed). (A) Perturbation 
of 30 jellyfish for the last 6 hours of the night. (B) Perturbation of 26 jellyfish for the first 6 
hours of the day. (C) Mean day and night activity pre- and post-perturbation for experiments 
shown in A and B. (D) Perturbation of 16 jellyfish for an entire 12-hour night. (E)

 and post-perturbation for experiments shown in D and E. Black-horizontal lines in A, B, D, 
and E indicate the windows of time used for calculating pre- and post-perturbation means 
shown in C and F for both the night (bottom lines) and day (top lines). For the 6-hour 
experiments we compared the first 4 hours of the post-perturbation day to the equivalent 
time pre-perturbation, and also compared the first 6 hours of post-perturbation night to the 
equivalent time pre-perturbation. For the 12-hour experiments we compared the full 12-hour 
days and nights pre- and post-perturbation. Two-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc 
comparisons between experimental groups using Bonferroni posttest (*P<5×10−2). Both day 
and night 6-hour perturbation experiments include data from four laboratory replicates. Both 
day and night 12-hour perturbation experiments include data from two laboratory replicates.
