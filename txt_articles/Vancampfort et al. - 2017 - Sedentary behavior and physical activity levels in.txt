People with severe mental illness (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder) die up to 15 years prematurely due to chronic somatic
comorbidities. Sedentary behavior and low physical activity are independent yet modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease and premature mor-
tality in these people. A comprehensive meta-analysis exploring these risk factors is lacking in this vulnerable population. We conducted a meta-
analysis investigating sedentary behavior and physical activity levels and their correlates in people with severe mental illness. Major electronic databases
were searched from inception up to April 2017 for articles measuring sedentary behavior and/or physical activity with a self-report questionnaire or an
objective measure (e.g., accelerometer). Random effects meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses were conducted. Sixty-nine studies were included
(N535,682; 39.5% male; mean age 43.0 years). People with severe mental illness spent on average 476.0 min per day (95% CI: 407.3-545.4) being seden-
tary during waking hours, and were significantly more sedentary than age- and gender-matched healthy controls (p50.003). Their mean amount of
moderate or vigorous physical activity was 38.4 min per day (95% CI: 32.0-44.8), being significantly lower than that of healthy controls (p50.002 for
moderate activity, p<0.001 for vigorous activity). People with severe mental illness were significantly less likely than matched healthy controls to meet
physical activity guidelines (odds ratio5 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.0, p<0.001, I2595.8). Lower physical activity levels and non-compliance with physical activ-
ity guidelines were associated with male gender, being single, unemployment, fewer years of education, higher body mass index, longer illness duration,
antidepressant and antipsychotic medication use, lower cardiorespiratory fitness and a diagnosis of schizophrenia. People with bipolar disorder were
the most physically active, yet spent most time being sedentary. Geographical differences were detected, and inpatients were more active than outpa-
tients and those living in the community. Given the established health benefits of physical activity and its low levels in people with severe mental illness,
future interventions specifically targeting the prevention of physical inactivity and sedentary behavior are warranted in this population.
Key words: Physical activity, sedentary behavior, severe mental illness, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, physical
activity guidelines, cardiovascular disease, premature mortality
(World Psychiatry 2017;16:308–315)
People with severe mental illness (schizophrenia, bipolar dis-
order or major depressive disorder) have higher levels of somatic
comorbidities and premature mortality than the general popula-
tion1-3. A recent meta-analysis4 documented that mortality rates
are approximately two to three times increased in these people.
The higher premature mortality rates are largely attributable to
cardiovascular disease5.
In the general population, there is evidence that physical activ-
ity and its structured form, exercise, are broadly as effective as
pharmacological interventions in preventing cardiovascular dis-
ease and reducing mortality6. However, people with severe men-
tal illness experience a range of barriers to engaging in physical
activity and exercise, such as high levels of perceived stress,
somatic comorbidities, low mood, and a lack of self-confidence
and of social support7-11.
More recently, the impact of prolonged periods of sedentary
behavior on risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality has
also been noted. A large meta-analysis of general population
studies12 reported that sedentary behavior (e.g., sitting or lying
down during waking hours) is independently associated with
increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, type 2
diabetes, and all-cause mortality.
Given that reduction in sedentary behavior and an active life-
style are related to lower cardiovascular disease risk, understand-
ing sedentary behavior, physical activity levels and their cor-
relates among people with severe mental illness may aid in
tailoring efforts to improve their long-term physical health
outcomes13. Next to this, there is a substantial body of evidence
that physical activity may have important mental health bene-
fits in people with severe mental illness, reducing depression
and improving social and cognitive functioning14-19.
Despite growing recognition of the importance of reducing
sedentary behavior and increasing physical activity levels to
improve the health and wellbeing of people with severe mental
illness, several important questions remain unanswered20. For
instance, although people with major depressive disorder, bipo-
lar disorder and schizophrenia have been found to be more sed-
entary and less physically active than controls21-24, it is unclear
whether differences between diagnostic subgroups exist. Identi-
fying whether there are differences in sedentary behavior and

RESEARCH REPORT
 physical activity levels between these clinical groups may assist
in developing rehabilitation priorities to prevent or reduce the
risk for somatic comorbidities and premature mortality.
Pooling data across major diagnostic categories also allows for
a large-scale investigation of the role of demographic and clinical
variables (gender, age, illness duration, employment status, edu-
cational level, marital status), physical health measures (body
mass index, cardiorespiratory fitness levels), other lifestyle (smok-
ing, alcohol use) and treatment-related factors (psychotropic
medication use), geographical differences, differences between
treatment settings (e.g., outpatients versus inpatients) and differ-
ences in physical activity and sedentary behavior assessment
(e.g., subjective versus objective assessments). Outcomes of these
analyses will assist identification of specific vulnerable sub-
groups, environmental factors (e.g., differences in health-related
policies or available facilities) and assessment methods.
The aims of the present global systematic review and meta-
analysis were to: a) establish the mean time people with severe
mental illness spend being sedentary or physically active (at
light, moderate and high intensity) per day, b) investigate differ-
ences between clinical subgroups, c) investigate predictors of
physical activity and sedentary behavior using meta-regression
analyses and d) explore differences in physical activity and sed-
entary behavior between people with severe mental illness and
age- and gender-matched healthy comparison subjects.
METHODS
This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the
MOOSE guidelines25 and in line with the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) stan-
dard26.
Eligibility criteria
We included studies: a) with observational (cross-sectional,
retrospective or prospective) and clinical or randomized con-
trolled trial designs having baseline data; b) in adults with a diag-
nosis – established through standard procedures (e.g., structured
or semi-structured diagnostic interviews) – of schizophrenia or
related psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder or major depressive
disorder according to DSM or ICD, irrespective of clinical setting
(inpatient, outpatient, community or mixed); c) measuring physi-
cal activity and sedentary behavior using either self-report ques-
tionnaires (e.g., the International Physical Activity Questionnaire,
IPAQ27) or objective measures (e.g., accelerometer).
Physical activity was defined as any activity that involved
bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles and that required
energy expenditure28, while sedentary behavior was defined as an
energy expenditure �1.5 metabolic equivalents of task (METs),
while in a sitting or reclining posture during waking hours29.
We excluded studies restricted to patients with or without car-
diovascular diseases, or with no adequate measure of physical
activity or sedentary behavior (i.e., no mean time per day engaged
in light, moderate or high intensity physical activity, or sedentary
behavior).
Search criteria, study selection and critical appraisal
Two independent authors (DV, BS) searched PubMed, Psyc-
ARTICLES, Embase and Cumulative Index to Nursing and
Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) from database inception to
April 1, 2017, without language restrictions.
Key words used were “physical activity” OR “exercise” OR
“sedent*” OR “sitting” OR “lying” OR “screen time” AND “severe
mental illness” OR “serious mental illness” OR “schizophrenia”
OR “psychosis” OR “bipolar disorder” OR “depression” OR
“depressive disorder” in the title, abstract or index term fields.
Manual searches were also conducted using the reference
lists from recovered articles and recent systematic reviews21-24.
Clinicaltrials.gov, www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero and www.who.
int/trialsearch were searched to identify any unpublished trials.
After removal of duplicates, the reviewers screened titles
and abstracts of all potentially eligible articles. Both authors
applied the eligibility criteria, and a list of full text articles was
developed through consensus. Next, the two reviewers consid-
ered the full texts of these articles and the final list of included
articles was reached through consensus. A third reviewer (FS)
was available for mediation throughout this process. Methodo-
logical appraisal included evaluation of bias (confounding,
overlapping data, publication bias).
Outcomes
The co-primary outcomes were the mean time (min) per
day that people with severe mental illness and healthy controls
(in case-control studies) engaged in physical activity, or were
sedentary. We collected separate data for light, moderate and
vigorous physical activity, in addition to total physical activity,
as defined by the original authors, if these data were reported.
We also collected data on those not meeting the physical
activity guidelines of 150 min of at least moderate intensity
physical activity per week30, and physical activity behavior
among healthy controls where this was reported.
Data extraction
One author (DV) extracted data using a pre-determined data
extraction form, which was independently validated by two
authors (BS and FS). The data extracted included first author,
country, geographical region (Europe, North America, South
America, Asia, Africa, Oceania), income status of the country
(low or middle versus high according to the World Bank classifi-
cation), setting (inpatient, outpatient, community, mixed), diag-
nostic group (schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar disorder, major
depressive disorder), type of study (cross-sectional, prospective,
retrospective, clinical or randomized controlled trial), age (years),

 gender (% males), employment status (% employed), educational
level (% with low education: elementary school or none), marital
status (% single), psychotropic medication use (% taking antipsy-
chotics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers), smoking (% current
smokers), alcohol use (units of alcohol per day), body mass index
(kg/m2), cardiorespiratory fitness status (maximal oxygen uptake,
ml/kg/min), physical activity and sedentary behavior assessment
method (objective or self-report), and the primary outcomes.
Statistical analyses
Due to anticipated heterogeneity, a random effects meta-
analysis was employed. Heterogeneity was measured by the I2
statistic, with values above 75 considered as a high level of
heterogeneity31.
The meta-analysis was undertaken in the following steps. First,
we pooled data on each physical activity category and sedentary
behavior for people with severe mental illness. Next, we com-
pared physical activity and sedentary behavior levels between
people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depres-
sive disorder and general population control groups that were
matched on age and gender, using data from studies in which
they were directly compared. In both analyses, only compari-
sons of specific severe mental illness groups or a severe mental
illness group with a matched general population group were in-
cluded that had been performed within the same study, in
order to minimize variability due to different sampling and as-
sessment procedures. We also conducted subgroup analyses to
investigate differences between the three main diagnostic sub-
groups, between settings and geographical regions, and be-
tween physical activity assessment methods (i.e., self-reported
vs. objective measures).
Further, we conducted meta-regression analyses (if the num-
ber of studies was at least 4) to investigate potential moderators:
age (years), % males, % unemployed, % single, % with low edu-
cation, illness duration (years), % antipsychotic medication use,
% antidepressant medication use, smoking prevalence, number
of alcohol drinks per day, body mass index (kg/m2), and cardio-
respiratory fitness levels (ml/kg/min), using the Comprehensive
Meta-Analysis software (version 3).
Publication bias was tested using the Egger’s regression meth-
od32 and Begg-Mazumdar test33, with a p value <0.05 suggesting
the presence of bias. When we encountered publication bias, we
conducted a trim and fill-adjusted analysis to remove the most
extreme small studies from the positive side of the funnel plot,
and recalculated the effect size iteratively, until the funnel plot
was symmetrical around the (new) effect size.
RESULTS
Study selection and included participants
The electronic database searches identified 526 articles (exclud-
ing irrelevant papers and duplicates) which were considered at
the title and abstract level. Four-hundred seventy full texts were
reviewed and 401 were excluded (see Figure 1), with 69 unique
studies (including 83 study estimates) meeting the eligibility
criteria.
The final sample comprised 35,682 unique persons with severe
mental illness (mean age 43.0 years; 39.5% male) and 2,933 con-
trols. The median sample size was 46. At study level, the mean
illness duration of people with severe mental illness was 16.6 years
(range 1.9-31.6), the mean body mass index was 29.1 kg/m2 (range
23.5-38.0) and the mean maximum oxygen uptake (measure of
cardiorespiratory fitness) was 21.4 ml/kg/min (range 14.8-31.6).
Twenty-four studies reported the percentage of current smokers,
with a mean prevalence of 42.2% (95% CI: 35.9-48.5%).
In data available from 20 studies, 57.6% (95% CI: 45.9-69.2%)
of the participants were single. In data reported in 16 studies,
62.3% (95% CI: 51.6-72.9%) were unemployed. Nine studies re-
ported on the educational level, with a percentage of 31.5%
(95% CI: 11.8-51.3%) having a level equal to or lower than ele-
mentary school.
In studies reporting on psychotropic medication use, 91.8%
(95% CI: 85.4-98.1%) were prescribed antipsychotics, 46.7%
(95% CI: 33.7-59.8%) antidepressants, and 17.9% (95% CI: 0.0-
36.9%) mood stabilizers. Overall, 23 study estimates of physical
activity were based on objective measures, three utilized objec-
tive and subjective measures and 57 were based on self-report
questionnaires.
Daily amount of sedentary behavior
Across 21 study estimates, people with severe mental illness
were sedentary for 476.0 min (95% CI: 407.3-545.4) per day
during waking hours. While the Begg-Mazumdar (Kendall’s tau
b 5 0.0, p50.97) indicated no publication bias, the Egger test
(bias 5 7.1; 95% CI: 0.4-13.7, p50.04) did. The trim and fill
analysis found, however, the same amount of sedentary
behavior per day (476.0 min).
People with severe mental illness were more sedentary than
healthy controls (standard mean difference, SMD 5 0.1; 95%
CI: 0.0-0.2, p50.003, I2537.1), equating to a mean difference
of 10.1 minutes per day (95% CI: 1.9-22.2).
There were geographical differences in sedentary behavior
(p<0.001, I2599.2). People in Europe were significantly less
sedentary (413 min per day, 95% CI: 335-491) than those in
North America (586 min per day, 95% CI: 461-712), South
America (555 min per day, 95% CI: 266-844) or Asia (579 min
per day, 95% CI: 369-789).
People with bipolar disorder (615 min per day, 95% CI: 456-
774) were significantly more sedentary (p<0.001, I2599.2)
than those with schizophrenia (493 min per day, 95% CI: 400-
586) or major depressive disorder (414 min per day, 95% CI:
323-505). There were no significant differences according to
the setting in which patients were living.
Greater amounts of sedentary behavior were found when
assessed using objective (574 min per day, 95% CI: 479-668)
310
World Psychiatry 16:3 - October 2017
 versus self-reported measures (403 min per day, 95% CI: 322-
485) (p<0.001).
None of the variables examined significantly moderated
levels of sedentary behavior (see Table 1).
Daily amount of moderate or vigorous physical activity
The mean amount of moderate or vigorous physical activity
in people with severe mental illness was 38.4 min per day
(95%
CI:
32.0-44.8).
The
Begg-Mazumdar
(Kendall’s
tau
b 5 0.5, p<0.001) and the Egger test (bias 5 7.2; 95% CI: 4.0-
10.4, p<0.001) indicated there was publication bias. The trim
and fill analysis confirmed, however, the same mean amount
of moderate or vigorous physical activity per day (38.4 min).
People with severe mental illness engaged in less moderate
physical activity (mean difference5 10.2 min, 95% CI: 17.2-3.2;
SMD50.35; 95% CI: 0.6-0.1, p50.002, I2576.8) and vigorous
physical activity (mean difference5 3.2 min, 95% CI: 6.4-1.1,
SMD50.2, 95% CI: 0.3-0.1, p<0.001, I2553.0) than healthy
controls.
Significantly higher levels of moderate or vigorous physical
activity were reported in Europe (47.6 min per day, 95% CI:
39.3-55.9), compared to North America (26.0 min per day, 95%
CI: 17.9-34.0) and Oceania (13.1 min per day, 95% CI: 0.0-34.2)
(p<0.001, I2597.9).
People with bipolar disorder (84.2 min per day, 95% CI:
60.3-108.1) engaged in significantly more (p<0.001, I2597.9)
moderate or vigorous physical activity than those with schizo-
phrenia (37.5 min per day, 95% CI: 29.1-46.0) and major
depressive disorder (28.8 min per day, 95% CI: 17.8-41.8).
Significant differences in moderate or vigorous physical
activity levels were observed according to the treatment set-
ting where patients were assessed (p50.001, I2597.9). Inpa-
tients (90.1 min per day, 95% CI: 72.7-107.5) were more
physically active than outpatients (32.5 min per day, 95% CI:
25.6-39.5), whilst community patients were the least active
(16.0 min per day, 95% CI: 9.5-22.5).
There were no significant differences between objective and
subjective measures of moderate or vigorous physical activity,
but significantly lower levels of vigorous physical activity
(p50.04, I2595.8) were reported with objective measures (2.4

 min per day, 95% CI: 0.0-4.8) vs. subjective reports (7.2 min
per day, 95% CI: 5.7-8.7).
Meta-regression analysis (Table 1) illustrated that a higher
percentage of people taking antidepressants, a lower percent-
age of male and single participants, a higher percentage of
unemployment, a lower percentage of smokers, a higher body
mass index and a lower cardiorespiratory fitness were associ-
ated with lower moderate or vigorous physical activity levels.
Across 28 study estimates and 29,523 people with severe
mental illness, 54.7% (95% CI: 48.8-60.6%; p<0.001, I2595.8)
did not meet the recommended 150 min of moderate physical
activity per week. While the Begg-Mazumdar (Kendall’s tau
b 5 0.1, p50.58) indicated there was no publication bias, the
Egger test (bias 5 3.1; 95% CI: 1.3-4.9; p50.002) did. The trim
and fill analysis found a lower rate (N adjustments 5 7): 44.9%
(95% CI: 38.2-49.7%).
People with severe mental illness were more likely not to
meet the physical activity guidelines than healthy controls
(odds ratio 5 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.0, p<0.001, I2595.8).
People with bipolar disorder (31.4%, 95% CI: 12.8-58.9)
were less likely not to meet the guidelines than those with
schizophrenia (54.8%, 95% CI: 43.4-65.6%) and major depres-
sive disorder (60.2%, 95% CI: 49.5-69.9%). There were no sig-
nificant differences between settings. The proportion meeting
the target was similar when assessed via objective measures
(57.0%, 95% CI: 37.7-74.4%) or subjective questionnaires
(54.5%, 95% CI: 48.2-60.6%). Meta-regression analysis demon-
strated that longer illness duration, lower educational level,
and antipsychotic medication prescription were associated
with a greater likelihood of not meeting the physical activity
target (see Table 1).

 people with severe mental illness using all of the data available
around the world. Data indicated that these people are more
sedentary than age- and gender-matched controls from the
general population, spending a mean of 476 min per day (or
almost 8 hours) during waking hours in sedentary behavior. In
addition, people with severe mental illness are significantly
less physically active and spend only an average of 38.4 min
per day in moderate or vigorous physical activity. Meta-
regression analysis revealed that a higher body mass index is
associated with lower moderate or vigorous physical activity.
Antidepressant prescription, male gender, unemployment,
non-tobacco use, and being single are associated with lower
moderate or vigorous physical activity levels.
In addition, our analyses revealed that approximately half of
people with severe mental illness do not meet the recommenda-
tion of at least 150 min of moderate physical activity per week,
and that these people are 50% more likely not to meet this
physical activity target compared to matched healthy controls.
Not meeting physical activity guidelines is associated with long-
er illness duration, less years of education and antipsychotic
medication prescription. Overall, not meeting physical activity
guidelines is estimated to occur in around 30% of the world
population34. Moreover, in the general population, it is esti-
mated that a decrease of 10% in the number of people not meet-
ing these guidelines could result in averting 533,000 premature
deaths each year35. Reducing sedentary behavior and increasing
physical activity levels of people with severe mental illness
should therefore be a global public health priority. Our findings
support recent calls to expand individual-focused and commu-
nity-level interventions at a global level in order to reduce excess
mortality in people with severe mental illness36,37.
We found significant geographical differences. People with
severe mental illness in Europe tend to have the highest mod-
erate or vigorous physical activity levels. One possible expla-
nation is that in many European mental health care settings,
in contrast with elsewhere in the world38-40, physical activity is
an integral part of the multidisciplinary treatment of people
with severe mental illness41. These findings indicate that, al-
though interest in physical activity in the treatment of these
people is increasing, the potential utility of physical activity
interventions as an integrated component of standard care is
yet to be fully embraced in most parts of the world.
The higher levels of moderate or vigorous physical activity in
inpatients suggest that there is increasing interest in aerobic
exercise as a valuable treatment modality in psychiatric cen-
tres42, especially when delivered by specialized health care pro-
fessionals43,44. In regions with limited resources, where such spe-
cialists are not readily available, the existing workforce should be
trained in assisting patients to reduce sedentary habits and adopt
a more active lifestyle45-48. In these low-resource contexts, in par-
ticular in outpatient and community settings, a stepped-care ap-
proach, where patients start with self-management, may be a
feasible strategy. Then, if patients do not achieve guideline-
specific levels of physical activity, they could continue with a
manualized approach under the supervision of a non-specialist
(e.g., a nurse). Patients would only be referred to a specialist cli-
nician (e.g., an exercise physiologist or physiotherapist) if no sig-
nificant increase in physical activity levels occurs.
Our data documented that higher body mass index, lower
cardiorespiratory fitness, and antidepressant or antipsychotic
prescription might constitute barriers for engaging in physical
activity. The association between antidepressant or antipsy-
chotic prescription and less physical activity may be due to
fatigue as a medication side effect. On the other hand, a psycho-
tropic medication prescription might as well be a measure-of-
proxy for illness severity. Due to the limited data available, we
were not able to assess the role of individual psychiatric symp-
toms and illness severity in sedentary behavior and physical
activity levels.
Our analyses also demonstrated that socio-demographic
factors should be considered. Those who are single or unem-
ployed, those with a low educational level and men are less
physically active. Novel strategies targeting outpatient and
community programs are warranted, as we consistently found
that inpatients engaged in higher levels of physical activity.
In our study, people with schizophrenia were the least phys-
ically active. While people with bipolar disorder were the most
physically active, they were also the most sedentary diagnostic
subgroup, indicating that both physical activity and sedentary
behavior should be considered. In people with severe mental
illness, sedentary behavior should be considered independent
from physical activity and has been associated with poorer
cognition49 and a worse metabolic profile50. Therefore, inter-
ventions to reduce sedentary behavior should be a major treat-
ment focus. Pragmatic and feasible interventions to reduce
sedentary behavior may include encouraging patients to rise
from a chair and move around during television commercial
breaks, or adding brief (e.g., less than or equal to 5 min) walks
throughout the day, for example walking short distances rather
than using motorized transport51.
Although many people with severe mental illness are unem-
ployed, those who continue working in more sedentary environ-
ments, such as office workers, should be supported in the use of
sit-to-stand desks as an effective way to reduce sedentary time52.
In addition, there is provisional evidence that, as in the general
population53, higher levels of physical activity may ameliorate
the relationship between sedentary behavior and metabolic
risk54, which adds to the pressing need to promote physical
activity in this population.
Another interesting finding in our subgroup analyses was
that objective measurement of physical activity resulted in
higher estimates of sedentary behavior and lower estimates of
vigorous physical activity compared to self-report question-
naires. In contrast with general population studies, this result
suggests that people with severe mental illness may underesti-
mate the amount of sedentary behavior they engage in and
overestimate their vigorous physical activity levels. There have
been concerns that reliance on self-report may lead to inaccu-

 rate estimates of physical activity in people with severe mental
illness55, which may be exacerbated by cognitive impairment
which is frequently present among people with schizophrenia
and bipolar disorder56 as well as major depression57. Clearly,
this calls for the development of more accurate and clinically
useful measures for clinical practice, if we are to monitor and
record physical activity in routine care58.
Finally, a somewhat counter-intuitive finding was the asso-
ciation between higher moderate or vigorous physical activity
levels and higher prevalence of tobacco smoking. It may be
that individuals with severe mental illness who smoke at low
levels have an increased affinity for physical activity, perhaps
because of its reward-related reinforcing effects. However,
more research is needed to understand this relationship.
Whilst the results of this meta-analysis are novel, several lim-
itations should be noted. First, the vast majority of the studies
included relied on data drawn from self-report questionnaires.
Second, we encountered high heterogeneity in the meta-analy-
ses we undertook, which is expected when pooling observational
data25. However, our subgroup and meta-regression analyses ex-
plained a large part of the between-study heterogeneity. Third,
there was inadequate information regarding specific medica-
tions prescribed, which precluded meta-analytical or meta-re-
gression analyses. Fourth, the data were cross-sectional and to
date there is a paucity of longitudinal physical activity research
in people with severe mental illness. Future research is required
to understand the impact of specific antipsychotics, antidepres-
sants and mood stabilizers on sedentary and physical activity
behavior. Nevertheless, allowing for these caveats, the current
meta-analysis provides important information for clinicians and
researchers.
In conclusion, our data document that people with severe
mental illness engage in significantly more sedentary behavior
and significantly less physical activity compared to healthy
controls, and are less likely to meet physical activity targets as
embodied in international guidelines. Addressing these modi-
fiable risk factors for premature mortality through the imple-
mentation of evidence-based sedentary behavior reduction
and physical activity promotion interventions is an interna-
tional imperative. We identified a number of potentially modifi-
able correlates of sedentary behavior and physical activity in
this vulnerable population. Translation of evidence-based inter-
ventions into routine care specifically aimed to reducing seden-
tary behavior and increasing physical activity is urgently re-
quired.
