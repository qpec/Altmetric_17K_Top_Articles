Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of 
death from cancer in the developed world [1]. 
Approximately 30–50% of patients will suffer recurrence 
despite achieving remission with initial treatment [2]. 
Consequently, patients are entered into a follow- 
up regi-
men with the goal of detecting recurrence at a stage where 
further curative- 
intent therapy might be beneficial. Recent 
reviews of randomized controlled trials determined that 
an intensive surveillance regimen is more effective than 
minimal surveillance [2, 3]. Patients with asymptomatic 
recurrence are more likely to be eligible for curative resec-
tion, to have an increased chance for successful surgery, 
and to have significantly better progression- 
free and overall 
survival rates after such surgery [3–6].
Regular blood testing for carcinoembryonic antigen 
(CEA, every 3- to 6 months) is currently the only blood 
test recommended for routine monitoring of CRC [7–13]. 
While CEA measurement is the most sensitive simple test 
to aid in the monitoring of CRC [10, 14–17], its sensitiv-
ity depends on what blood level, or changes in it, are

Abstract
Recurrence will develop in 30–50% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases despite 
apparent clearance following treatment. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the 
only guideline- 
recommended blood test for monitoring cases for recurrence, 
but its sensitivity and specificity are suboptimal. This observational study com-
pared a novel 2- 
gene (methylated BCAT1 and IKZF1 DNA) blood test with 
CEA for detection of recurrent CRC. We conducted a paired comparison of 
the BCAT1/IKZF1 test with CEA (cut- 
off 5 ng/mL) in blood from patients in 
remission after treatment for primary CRC and undergoing surveillance. Blood 
collected in the 12 months prior to or 3 months after complete investigational 
assessment of recurrence status were assayed and the results compared by Mc-
Nemar’s test. Of 397 patients enrolled, 220 underwent satisfactory assessment 
for recurrence and 122 had blood testing performed within the prescribed period. 
In 28 cases with recurrent CRC, CEA was positive in 9 (32%; 95% CI 16–52%) 
compared to 19 (68%; 95% CI 48–84%) positive for methylated BCAT1/IKZF1 
(P = 0.002). All samples that were CEA positive were also BCAT1/IKZF1 posi-
tive. In 94 patients without clinically detectable recurrence, CEA was positive 
in 6 (6%, 95% CI 2–13%) and BCAT1/IKZF1 in 12 (13%, 95% CI 7–21%), 
P = 0.210. The odds ratio of a positive CEA test for recurrence was 6.9 (95% 
CI 2–22) compared to 14.4 (5–39) for BCAT1/IKZF1. The BCAT1/IKZF1 test 
was more sensitive for recurrence than CEA and the odds of recurrence given 
a positive test was twice that of CEA. The BCAT1/IKZF1 test should be further 
considered for monitoring cases for recurrence.

chosen for positivity. Some have considered it too insensi-
tive to be used alone [16].
We have previously reported several genes with hyper-
methylated regions differentiating adenoma and adenocar-
cinoma tissues from normal colorectal epithelium and benign 
pathologies [18, 19]. Two of these genes, branched- 
chain 
amino acid transaminase 1 (BCAT1) and ikaros family zinc 
finger protein 1 (IKZF1) may play an important functional 
role in maintaining a healthy colorectal tissue [20, 21], and 
both BCAT1 and IKZF1 appear to be involved in tumor 
growth and invasiveness [21–26]. Solid tumors, including 
CRC [25, 27], release DNA into circulation, and we have 
shown that cell free circulating DNA in blood from CRC 
patients has a significantly higher fraction of methylated 
BCAT1 and IKZF1 compared to healthy controls [28, 29].
The accuracy of the methylated BCAT1 and IKZF1 
blood test (hereinafter referred to as the BCAT1/IKZF1 
test) for detection of CRC has been assessed in two stud-
ies including nearly 3500 patients scheduled for colonos-
copy. It was found to be 62–66% sensitive and 92–94% 
specific [29, 30]. For CRC stages I- 
IV, the true- 
positivity 
rates were in the ranges of 38–41%, 69–76%, 59–73%, 
and 71–94%, respectively. In addition, 12 BCAT1/IKZF1 
test- 
positive CRC cases with paired pre- 
 and post- 
surgery 
plasma showed reduction in methylation signal after sur-
gery, with complete disappearance in 10 patients [29]. 
Thus, the BCAT1/IKZF1 blood test might have merit for 
surveillance for recurrence in cases with CRC.
The goal of this study, which incorporated clinic visits, 
blood sampling, and diagnostic imaging, was to compare 
the sensitivity and specificity of the BCAT1/IKZF1 blood 
test to CEA, when applied on a single occasion, for detec-
tion of recurrent CRC in patients undergoing surveillance. 
True- and false- 
positive rates for radiologically or histo-
pathologically confirmed recurrence were compared and 
absolute sensitivity and specificity derived from these.
Methods
Study overview
This was an observational study that compared the accu-
racy of a blood test detecting methylated BCAT1 and 
IKZF1 DNA with a blood test measuring CEA levels in 
CRC patients under surveillance for disease recurrence. 
As there is no single gold standard for determination of 
recurrence, and pathological confirmation is not always 
obtained, a combination of analytical and clinical infor-
mation for establishing recurrence status was applied (see 
below). The true- 
 and false- 
positive rates of the BCAT1/
IKZF1 and CEA blood tests were determined in the blood 
sample temporally closest to the investigation verifying 
recurrence status.
The study was approved by the Southern Adelaide 
Clinical Human Research Ethics Committee. Written 
informed consent was obtained from all volunteering 
participants prior to any procedures. The trial is registered 
at Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, 
trial registration number 12611000318987.
Population
Any adults (18 years of age or older) who were recently 
diagnosed but without residual macroscopic disease after 
initial treatment for CRC (AJCC stages I–IV) [31] or 
who were already undergoing surveillance monitoring for 
CRC recurrence at Flinders Medical Centre (Bedford Park, 
SA, Australia) were approached consecutively, wherever 
feasible, about volunteering for the study during the period 
of 24 months from November 2013. A CT examination 
of chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed at 12 monthly 
intervals subject to the discretion of the clinician and 
depending on individual risk. Blood samples were obtained 
(usually at 3–6 month intervals) either in the 12 months 
prior to planned radiological imaging, at the time of 
confirmed recurrence, or within 3 months of confirma-
tion but prior to any further treatment. Following enroll-
ment, volunteers were excluded if initial treatment was 
not completed, if residual disease was evident, if radio-
logical imaging was not obtained as part of assessment 
for recurrence, if imaging findings were indeterminate 
for recurrence, or if blood was collected during or within 
3 months of any chemotherapy or radiotherapy 
treatment.
Clinical procedures
Venous blood was collected into two 9 mL K3EDTA 
Vacuette 
tubes 
(Greiner 
Bio- 
One, 
Frickenhausen, 
Germany) at clinic visits. Blood collection tubes were kept 
at 4°C prior to plasma processing (not more than 4 h 
from blood collection). Plasma was prepared by centrifu-
gation at 1500g for 10 min at 4°C (deceleration at lowest 
setting), followed by retrieval of the plasma fraction and 
a repeat centrifugation. The resulting plasma was stored 
at −80°C. Frozen plasma samples were shipped on dry 
ice to Clinical Genomics Technologies (North Ryde, NSW, 
Australia) and stored at −80°C until testing. Cases were 
excluded from analysis if these conditions were not met. 
No study- 
wide control of radiological imaging or pathol-
ogy procedures or quality was undertaken as the study 
aimed to assess marker performance relative to outcomes 
determined in usual clinical practice. All procedures were 
performed by hospital- 
accredited specialists and so met 
site- 
specific standards for venipuncture, monitoring, 
 
imaging, and equipment.

Detection of Recurrent Colorectal Cancer

Classification of recurrence status
A combination of analytical and clinical information was 
used to establish the presence or absence of clinically 
detectable recurrence, that is, recurrence “status”
, as there 
is no single gold standard technique for diagnosing recur-
rence status and histopathological confirmation is not 
always obtained. An independent physician, blinded to 
assay results, confirmed clinical recurrence status for all 
cases on basis of the findings of diagnostic tests (radiol-
ogy, namely CT, MRI, or PET scan; or colonoscopy) sup-
ported by tissue diagnosis when available (not all cases 
with recurrence determined by imaging were subjected to 
histopathological confirmation). Recurrence was therefore 
confirmed to be present if any of the following applied: 
(1) Radiologically detected recurrence (CT, MRI, or PET 
scan, of abdomen, pelvis, and chest) confirmed by tissue 
pathology (date of diagnosis was the date of the radiol-
ogy), (2) radiologically detected recurrence not subject to 
tissue pathology but affirmed as recurrence by the clinical 
management team (date of diagnosis was the date of the 
radiology), or (3) colonoscopically detected local recurrence 
at the anastomosis confirmed by tissue pathology (date 
of diagnosis was the date of the colonoscopy). Cases were 
excluded if any data crucial to determining clinical status 
were not obtainable, for example, inconclusive radiological 
imaging.
Evidence of recurrence in the perianastomotic site or 
rectal stump, presacral area, as well as regional nodal 
recurrence or lateral pelvic lymph node recurrence of 
rectal cancer was defined as local recurrence. Evidence of 
recurrence in the liver, lung, or other organs such as 
para- 
aortic lymph nodes, peritoneum, bone, brain, adrenal 
gland was defined as distant recurrence. In cases diagnosed 
with both local and distant recurrences, distant recurrence 
was used as the principal diagnosis. Metachronous CRC 
(i.e., tumors detected in the colon at locations remote to 
the primary diagnosis) was not classified as recurrence 
and hence omitted from primary analysis.
Recurrence status was determined as “not clinically detect-
able” where the clinical management team considered that 
routine tests conducted as part of surveillance in the prior 
12 months did not show evidence of recurrence. As a 
minimum, this must have included a satisfactory CT scan 
of chest, abdomen and pelvis, or alternative radiological 
imaging of these regions such as MRI or PET (collectively 
referred to hereafter as “radiological imaging”).
DNA methylation testing
The presence of methylated BCAT1 and IKZF1 DNA in 
3.9 mL plasma was determined as previously reported 
[30]. A sample was deemed positive if at least one PCR 
replicate was positive for either BCAT1 and/or IKZF1 DNA 
methylation. Blood testing was performed by staff blinded 
to all clinical data.
CEA testing
The concentration of CEA was determined using the 
LIAISON CEA test as recommended by manufacturer 
(DiaSorin S.p.A., Saluggia, Italy). A sample with CEA levels 
of 5 ng/mL or above was deemed positive, as commonly 
applied [16].
Statistical analyses
A sample size of 24 pairs with recurrence would have 
80% power to detect a difference in proportions of 0.300 
based on an expected proportion of discordant pairs of 
0.350 (using McNemar’s test with a 0.050 two- 
sided sig-
nificance level), hence we undertook the analysis when 
we were confident that at least 25 cases with confirmed 
recurrence had been recruited. The principal outcome 
measure was positivity rate by recurrence status, verified 
as present or not clinically detectable by the clinical deci-
sion described above. Where more than one sample was 
collected, the sample temporally closest to verification of 
diagnostic status was considered. If an assay result was 
indeterminate, or missing, the case was excluded from 
analysis. Differences in paired positivity proportions and 
concordance analyses were analyzed using McNemar’s test 
(two- 
sided; significance level, 0.05). Binomial distribution 
was assumed for calculations of exact 95% confidence 
interval (95% CI). Test sensitivity estimates were expressed 
as the ratio of true positives over the sum of true posi-
tives plus false negatives. Specificity was estimated as 1 
– positivity rate in cases with no evidence of recurrent 
disease. Stata version 13 was used for the statistical analyses 
described above. P- 
values <0.05 were considered statisti-
cally significant.
Results
Study volunteers
A total of 397 volunteers were recruited (61.2% men, 
median 66.1 years of age at diagnosis). Figure 1 shows 
the disposition of volunteers and the reasons for exclusion 
during surveillance and prior to determination of recur-
rence status; 33% had not completed relevant scheduled 
investigations for recurrence while 11% were either found 
not to be in remission or to have developed a cancer 
other than CRC. Recurrence status could be established 
in 220 patients under surveillance. Table S1 shows demo-
graphic features of the volunteers including the nature

of recurrence, as well as CRC stage at diagnosis, with 
approximately equal numbers of patients diagnosed with 
early (I–II) and late (III–IV) stage CRC. The median ages 
of those with recurrence or without clinically detectable 
recurrence were similar (data not shown). The majority 
of recurrences were distant (35/41, 85.4%).
Suitable blood samples were available from 122 of the 
220 patients with verified recurrence status (blood col-
lected 12 months prior to, or 3 months after verification 
of status), as shown in Figure 1. Full details of these are 
shown in Table 1 where it can be seen that only 8 of 
the 28 with recurrence were of an early stage (all stage 
II) at diagnosis. Recurrence was most common with an 
initial staging of III or IV and in those with rectal cancer 
(Table 1). Morphological features associated with confirmed 
recurrence were the presence of lymphovascular and/or 
perineural invasion. The time elapsed between date of 
verification of recurrence status and the date of blood 
sampling did not differ between those with or without 
recurrence (Table 1).
Test sensitivity for recurrence
Results of the methylated BCAT1/IKZF1 and CEA tests 
are shown in Table 2 for the 122 patients eligible for 
analysis.
Of the 28 patients with recurrent CRC, 67.9% (19/28, 
95% CI 48–84%) and 32.1% (9/28, 95% CI 16–52%) 
were positive for methylated BCAT1/IKZF1 DNA and CEA, 
respectively. This difference of 35.8% (95% CI 14–57%) 
was significant. Similar results were seen in cases with 
distant recurrence but numbers with local recurrence were 
small. The odds ratio for recurrence was 14.4 (95% CI 
5.4–38.7) for the methylated BCAT1/IKZF1 test (P < 0.001) 
and 6.9 (95% CI 2.3–21.1) for CEA (P = 0.001). Sensitivity 
of the methylated BCAT1/IKZF1 blood test for recurrence 
was 75.0% in patients with stage II cancer at diagnosis 
(6/8), 70.6% of the stage III cancers (12/17), and 33.3% 
of the stage IV cancers (1/3). Sensitivity estimates of the 
methylated BCAT1/IKZF1 test for local and distant recur-
rence were 75% and 66.7%, respectively, compared to 50% 
and 29.2% for CEA (Table 2).
Comparing those with or without verified recurrence, 
there was no significant difference in elapsed time between 
blood collection and clinical confirmation of recurrence 
status (Table S2).
Estimates of specificity and predictive 
values
Of the 94 cases without clinically detectable recurrence, 
12.8% (12/94, 95% CI 7–21%) and 6.4% (6/96, 95% CI

2–13%) were positive for methylated BCAT1/IKZF1 DNA 
and CEA, respectively (Table 2). The difference of 6.4% 
(95% CI 3–16%) was not significant, P = 0.134). The 
positive predictive values of methylated BCAT1/IKZF1 and 
CEA were 61.3% (42.2–78.2%) and 60.0% (32.3–83.7%), 
respectively. The negative predictive values were 90.1% 
(82.1–95.4%) and 82.2% (73.7–89.0%), respectively.
Test concordance
Concordance between the two blood tests is shown in 
Table 3. Of the 28 cases with recurrence, 9 (32.1%) were 
positive in both tests, whereas the methylated BCAT1/
IKZF1 test detected an additional 10 cases that were CEA 
negative, indicating a significantly better sensitivity with

the methylated BCAT1/IKZF1 test (P = 0.002). There were 
no cases that were CEA positive only.
In those with no clinically detectable recurrence, only one 
was positive for both tests. Eleven were positive by methyl-
ated BCAT1/IKZF1 only, and 5 by CEA only (P = 0.210).
Longitudinal test results over time
Of the 122 patients with recurrence status defined, 30 
cases provided more than one blood sample taken within 
the qualifying window (12 months prior, 3 months after); 
7 had recurrence and 23 cases had no clinically detectable 
recurrence.
In 28 of those 30 cases, the second closest BCAT1/
IKZF1 test result was in concordance with the result 
closest to diagnostic verification of recurrence status 
(which was used for the main analysis). This included 
seven recurrence cases, one of whom had an intervening 
negative CT scan (Fig. 2A), and 21 cases with no clini-
cally detectable recurrence including three cases with 
apparent false- 
positive results that remained positive 
with a second later blood test (example provided in 
Fig. 2B).
For the remaining two cases who had no clinical- 
detectable recurrence, the second blood tests were negative 
(example provided in Fig. 2C).

Detection of Recurrent Colorectal Cancer
G. P
. Young et al.
Variables influencing positivity
Of the seven patients diagnosed with a cancer other than 
CRC, six had blood sample collection. Cancers diagnosed 
included breast cancer with metastasis to the bones, thy-
roid cancer, metastasis to the abdominal cavity from a 
large cell carcinoma, metastasis to the lymph nodes from 
ovarian cancer, and two patients with renal cell carcinoma. 
The methylated BCAT1/IKZF1 test was positive in the 
former three cases, with CEA levels above 5 ng/mL in 
two patients (breast cancer and thyroid cancer).
The methylated BCAT1/IKZF1 test positivity was not 
affected by gender or age (Table S3).
Discussion
This test for methylated BCAT1 and IKZF1 DNA in blood 
facilitates detection of recurrent CRC. A direct paired 
comparison to the CEA blood test demonstrated that the 
BCAT1/IKZF1 test had a significantly better sensitivity for 
recurrence, whereas the two tests did not significantly 
differ in specificity. Using the odds ratio as a single indi-
cator of diagnostic performance [32], the odds of recur-
rence being present with a positive BCAT1/IKZF1 test 
was twice that with CEA.
Based on the observed true- 
positive rate of the BCAT1/
IKZF1 blood test using the blood sample taken closest 
to radiological confirmation of recurrence status, sensitivity 
estimates for local and distant recurrence were 75% and 
66.7%, respectively. The estimated sensitivity for any recur-
rence was 67.9%. These estimates justify considering the 
use of the BCAT1/IKZF1 blood test in surveillance for 
recurrent CRC. A minority of stage II CRC cases received 
adjuvant therapy and had a lower risk of recurrence. 
Nonetheless, the BCAT1/IKZF1 blood test was positive in 
6/8 (75%) of the recurrences occurring in patients initially 
diagnosed with stage II CRC. This suggests that the BCAT1/
IKZF1 blood test might be usefully applied in surveillance 
of all cases in remission, regardless of initial stage.
We compared the BCAT1/IKZF1 blood test with the 
CEA blood test because the latter is the only noninvasive 
blood test recommended by several authorities in their 
guidelines for CRC surveillance [7–9, 11, 12, 33]. Using 
the commonly applied cut- 
off value of 5 ng/mL [16], we 
estimated sensitivity of CEA for recurrence to be 32.1% 
overall, with estimates for local and distant recurrence of 
50 and 29.2%, respectively. These values tend to be lower 
than what is reported in the literature [16] and the rea-
sons for this are unclear. The lower sensitivity for CEA 
may be partly due to this study being cross- 
sectional, 
that is, consideration of the result in a plasma sample 
taken at just one point in time rather than a change in 
test result over time.
When comparing true- 
positive rates in the same patient, 
the methylated BCAT1/IKZF1 blood test had a significantly 
higher sensitivity for recurrent CRC than the CEA test 
(Tables 2 and 3), and in this study, the BCAT1/IKZF1 
blood test correctly identified 10 additional cases of recur-
rent CRC. The design of this study did not allow us to 
systematically determine if the BCAT1/IKZF1 blood test 
was able to detect cases with recurrent CRC earlier than 
the CEA test. A prospective study with multiple sampling 
commencing at the end of initial CRC treatment would 
be needed to address this question and is justified based 
on our findings. Earlier detection is considered important 
to survival [5].
Based on the observed false- 
positive rates for the meth-
ylated BCAT1/IKZF1 and CEA blood tests, using radio-
logical imaging as an essential element for deciding upon 
recurrence status, the specificity estimates were 87.2% and 
93.6%, respectively, and were not significantly different 
(P = 0.210).
A limitation of the study is that the calculations of the 
true- and false- 
positivity rates were dependent on the 
findings at clinical investigation relative to the result 
obtained with the temporally closest blood test. It is pos-
sible that the specificity estimate for either test reported 
herein is too low and that some false- 
positives are appar-
ent rather than real due to the presence of subclinical 
recurrence not yet detectable by imaging. Radiological 
imaging can only detect recurrences within the limit of 
detection. As a consequence, a result designated now as 
a false- 
positive might ultimately be true. In Figure 2A, 
we show a case which returned an apparent false positive 
that became a true positive on a subsequent imaging scan. 
Longitudinal follow- 
up studies with serial blood testing 
are required to understand whether false- 
positives correlate 
with recurrence detectable only at a subsequent radiologi-
cal follow up.
In addition to the issue of length of follow- 
up, this 
study has some other limitations. It is an observational 
study conducted in a usual- 
care moderate- 
sized clinical 
service where follow- 
up protocols are subject to variance, 
rather than in the context of a formal highly structured 
prospective clinical trial. As such, the timing of blood 
tests relative to diagnostic imaging varied. Most samples 
were collected before diagnostic assessment but some were 
collected in the window afterwards, such that the tests 
were being compared at different stages of the biological 
progression to clinically detectable recurrence. We chose 
the window of 12 months prior to radiological assessment 
for recurrence (as this is the usual interval aimed for in 
practice) and 3 months after such (as long as treatment 
was not instigated) for the purposes of comparing the 
two tests, but in future, multiple blood sampling over 
time with repeated diagnostic imaging as per surveillance

protocols will serve to further clarify the actual and rela-
tive value of each test.
Finally, this study does not explore impact on survival. 
In- 
so- 
far as a modest survival benefit with CEA testing 
as part of a surveillance protocol has been observed [3], 
and that the BCAT1/IKZF1 test is more sensitive for recur-
rence in our study, then definitive studies aimed at assess-
ing potential survival benefit with the BCAT1/IKZF1 test 
are now indicated. There might also be potential for 
prediction of prognosis independent of stage, as has been 
reported for other biomarkers [34].
The presence of methylated BCAT1 and IKZF1 DNA 
in blood is not likely to be limited to CRC only [24, 
35], and as reported here, three of six cases diagnosed 
with other cancers were positive with the BCAT1/IKZF1 
test. Studies to examine its relevance to other cancers are 
now underway.
The methylated BCAT1/IKZF1 test is twofold more sen-
sitive than the CEA test for CRC recurrence, whereas there 
is no significant difference in the specificity estimates 
between the two tests. Furthermore, the odds of recurrence 
given a positive methylated BCAT1/IKZF1 test is 14.4 
compared to 6.9 with a positive CEA test. If used in sur-
veillance as a trigger to bring forward scheduled radiological 
imaging, recurrence seems likely to be detected earlier 
without undue load on radiological services. Consequently, 
it is now justifiable to proceed to a prospective longitudinal 
evaluation of the methylated BCAT1/IKZF1 blood test 
versus CEA to ascertain the temporal relationships between 
positivity and recurrence (and hence the ideal frequency 
of testing), relative sensitivity and specificity on the basis 
of longer follow- 
up and whether better and/or earlier 
detection leads to any survival benefit.
