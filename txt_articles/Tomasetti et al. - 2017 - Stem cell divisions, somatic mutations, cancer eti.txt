Abstract
Cancers are caused by mutations that may be inherited, induced by environmental factors, or result 
from DNA replication errors (R). We studied the relationship between the number of normal stem 
cell divisions and the risk of 17 cancer types in 69 countries throughout the world. The data 
revealed a strong correlation (median = 0.80) between cancer incidence and normal stem cell 
divisions in all countries, regardless of their environment. The major role of R mutations in cancer 
etiology was supported by an independent approach, based solely on cancer genome sequencing 
and epidemiological data, which suggested that R mutations are responsible for two-thirds of the 
mutations in human cancers. All of these results are consistent with epidemiological estimates of 
the fraction of cancers that can be prevented by changes in the environment. Moreover, they 
accentuate the importance of early detection and intervention to reduce deaths from the many 
cancers arising from unavoidable R mutations.
It is now widely accepted that cancer is the result of the gradual accumulation of driver gene 
mutations that successively increase cell proliferation (1–3). But what causes these 
mutations? The role of environmental factors (E) in cancer development has long been 
evident from epidemiological studies, and this has fundamental implications for primary 
prevention. The role of heredity (H) has been conclusively demonstrated from both twin 
studies (4) and the identification of the genes responsible for cancer predisposition

 syndromes (3, 5). We recently hypothesized that a third source—mutations due to the 
random mistakes made during normal DNA replication (R)—can explain why cancers occur 
much more commonly in some tissues than others (6). This hypothesis was based on our 
observation that, in the United States, the lifetime risks of cancer among 25 different tissues 
were strongly correlated with the total number of divisions of the normal stem cells in those 
tissues (6, 7). It has been extensively documented that approximately three mutations occur 
every time a normal human stem cell divides (8, 9). We therefore inferred that the root 
causes of the correlation between stem cell divisions and cancer incidence were the driver 
gene mutations that randomly result from these divisions. Recent evidence from mouse 
models supports the notion that the number of normal cell divisions dictates cancer risk in 
many organs (10).
This hypothesis has generated much scientific and public debate and confusion, in part 
because our analysis was confined to explaining the relative risk of cancer among tissues 
rather than the contribution of each of the three potential sources of mutations (E, H, and R) 
to any single cancer type or cancer case. Determination of the contributions of E, H, and R 
to a cancer type or cancer case is challenging. In some patients, the contribution of H or R 
factors might be high enough to cause all the mutations required for that patient’s cancer, 
whereas in others, some of the mutations could be due to H, some to R, and the remainder to 
E. Here we perform a critical evaluation of the hypothesis that R mutations play a major role 
in cancer. Our evaluation is predicated on the expectation that the number of endogenous 
mutations (R) resulting from stem cell divisions in a tissue, unlike those caused by 
environmental exposures, would be similarly distributed at a given age across human 
populations. Though the number of stem cell divisions may vary with genetic constitution 
(e.g., taller individuals may have more stem cells), these divisions are programmed into our 
species’ developmental patterns. In contrast, deleterious environmental and inherited factors, 
either of which can directly increase the mutation rate or the number of stem cell divisions, 
vary widely among individuals and across populations.
Our previous analyses were confined to the U.S. population, which could be considered to 
be exposed to relatively uniform environmental conditions (6). In this study, we have 
evaluated cancer incidence in 69 countries, representing a variety of environments 
distributed throughout the world and representing 4.8 billion people (two-thirds of the 
world’s population). Cancer incidences were determined from analysis of 423 cancer 
registries that were made available by the International Agency for Research on Cancer 
(IARC) (http://ci5.iarc.fr/CI5-X/Pages/download.aspx). All 17 different cancer types 
recorded in the IARC database for which stem cell data are available were used for this 
analysis (see supplementary materials). The Pearson’s correlation coefficients of the lifetime 
risk of cancer in a given tissue with that tissue’s lifetime number of stem cell divisions are 
shown in Fig. 1. Strong, statistically significant correlations were observed in all countries 
examined (median P value = 1.3 × 10−4; full range: 2.2 × 10−5 to 6.7 × 10−3). The median 
correlation was 0.80 (95% range: 0.67 to 0.84), with 89% of the countries having 
correlations >0.70 in the 0 to 85+ age interval (Table 1). This correlation of 0.80 is nearly 
identical to that observed for a somewhat different set of tissues, which did not include those 
of the breast or prostate, in the U.S. population (6). Details of the incidence data and 
correlations for each evaluated country and registry are provided in tables S1 to S4.

 The correlations in Fig. 1 were derived for the largest age interval available (0 to 85+ in 
Table 1). Data on individuals from the same countries at younger ages indicate that the 
larger the age range considered, the higher the correlation. Note that cancer incidence 
increases exponentially with age (11), but stem cell divisions do not increase proportionally 
with age in tissues with low or no cell turnover, such as bone and brain. An increase in the 
evaluated age range would therefore be expected to be associated with an increase in the 
correlation between the lifetime number of stem cell divisions and cancer incidence, as was 
observed (Table 1).
The universally high correlations between normal stem cell divisions and cancer incidences 
shown in Table 1 are surprising given the voluminous data indicating large differences in 
exposures to environmental factors and associated cancer incidences across the world (12–
16). To explore the basis for this apparent discrepancy, we sought to determine what 
fractions of cancer-causing mutations result from E, H, or R. As these fractions have not 
been estimated for any cancer type, we developed an approach to achieve this goal. A 
theoretical example that illustrates the underlying conceptual basis of this approach is as 
follows. Imagine that a population of humans in which all inherited mutations have been 
corrected move to Planet B, where the environment is perfect. On this planet, E and H are 
zero, and the only somatic mutations are caused by R. Note that the number of R mutations 
in all tissues is >0, regardless of the environment, because perfect, error-free replication is 
incompatible with basic biologic principles of evolution. Suppose that a powerful mutagen, 
E, was then introduced into the environment of Planet B, and all inhabitants of Planet B 
were equally exposed to it throughout their lifetimes. Assume that this mutagen substantially 
increased the somatic mutation rate in normal stem cells, causing a 10-fold increase in 
cancer risk, i.e., 90% of all cancer cases on this planet were now attributable to E. Therefore, 
90% of all cancer cases on Planet B would be preventable by avoiding exposure to E. But 
even in this environment, it can be shown that 40% of the driver gene mutations are 
attributable to R (Fig. 2A and supplementary materials). This extreme example demonstrates 
that even if the vast majority of cancer cases were preventable by reducing exposure to 
environmental factors, a large fraction of the driver gene mutations required for those 
cancers can still be due to R—as long as the number of mutations contributed by normal 
stem cell divisions is not zero. In other words, the preventability of cancers and the etiology 
of the driver gene mutations that cause those cancers are related but have different metrics 
(see supplementary materials for their mathematical relationship).
This theoretical example is not very different from what occurs on Earth with respect to the 
etiology of the most common form of lung cancer, adenocarcinoma. Epidemiologic studies 
have estimated that nearly 90% of adenocarcinomas of the lung are preventable and that 
tobacco smoke is by far the major component of E. Secondhand smoking, occupational 
exposures, ionizing radiation, air pollution, and diet play important but smaller roles (17, 
18). Moreover, no hereditary factors have been implicated in lung adenocarcinomas (19). To 
determine the fraction of mutations attributable to nonenvironmental and nonhereditary 
causes in lung adenocarcinomas, we developed an approach based on the integration of 
genome-wide sequencing and epidemiological data. The key insight is the recognition of a 
relationship between mutation rates in a cancer type and the etiology of the somatic 
mutations that are detected in that cancer. Specifically, if an environmental factor causes the

 normal somatic mutation rate to increase by a factor x, then (x−1)/x of the somatic mutations 
found in a cancer can be attributed to that environmental factor (see supplementary 
materials). For example, if patients exposed to a factor E have a mutation rate that is three 
times higher than that of patients not exposed to it, then two-thirds of the mutations in the 
exposed patients can be attributed to factor E. This method is completely independent of any 
data or knowledge about normal stem cell divisions. We applied this approach to 
representative patients with lung adenocarcinomas as depicted in Fig. 2B. In 8 of the 20 
depicted patients, all of the driver gene mutations can be attributed to E. In 10 of the 20 
depicted patients, a portion of the driver gene mutations are attributable to E. And in the two 
patients depicted on the bottom right of Fig. 2B, none of the driver gene mutations are 
attributable to E. We calculate that 35% [95% confidence interval (CI): 30 to 40%] of the 
total driver gene mutations are due to factors that, according to current exhaustive 
epidemiologic studies, are unrelated to H or E and thus are presumably due to R. These data 
are based on conservative assumptions about the risk contributed by factors other than 
smoking. For example, we assumed that the increase in mutations resulting from poor diet is 
identical to the increase resulting from smoking cigarettes. Thus, Cancer Research UK 
estimates that the great majority (89%) of lung adenocarcinoma cases are preventable (17), 
but even so, more than a third (35%) of the driver gene mutations in lung cancers can be 
attributed to R.
This same analytic approach can be applied to cancer types for which epidemiologic studies 
have indicated a less pronounced role of environmental factors. Figure 2C depicts pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinomas. About 37% of these cancers are thought to be preventable (versus 
89% for lung adenocarcinomas) (17). Using exome sequencing data and extremely 
conservative assumptions about the influence of environmental factors, we calculated that 
18% of the driver gene mutations were due to environmental factors, at most 5% were due to 
hereditary factors, and the remaining 77% (95% CI: 67 to 84%) were due to 
nonenvironmental and nonhereditary factors, presumably R (see supplementary materials). 
As with lung adenocarcinomas, these results are independent of any assumptions about, or 
measurements of, stem cell divisions.
A third class of cancers comprise those in which only a very small effect of E or H has been 
demonstrated (17), such as those of the brain, bone, or prostate. For example, a very high 
fraction of the driver gene mutations in prostate cancers can be attributed to R (95%; Fig. 2D 
and supplementary materials). In the past, the causes of cancer types like these were 
obscure, as there was no evidence that the two most well-recognized causes of cancer—
environment and heredity—play a substantial role. The recognition that a third source of 
mutations, i.e., those due to R, are omnipresent helps explain the pathogenesis of these 
malignancies. Even if future epidemiological or genetic studies identify previously unknown 
E or H factors that permit 90% of cancers of the prostate to be prevented, the percentage of 
mutations due to R will still be very high, as illustrated by the Planet B analogy in Fig. 2A.
We next calculated the proportion of driver gene mutations caused by E or H in 32 cancer 
types (see supplementary materials and tables S5 and S6). We considered those mutations 
not attributable to either E or H to be due to R. These cancers have been studied in depth 
through sophisticated epidemiological investigations and are reported in the Cancer

 Research UK database [see (17, 20–22) and references therein]. For the U.K. female 
population, mutations attributable to E (right), R (center), and H (left) are depicted in Fig. 3 
(see fig. S2 for equivalent representations of males and table S6 for the numerical values for 
both sexes). The median proportion of driver gene mutations attributable to E was 23% 
among all cancer types. The estimate varied considerably: It was greater than 60% in 
cancers such as those of the lung, esophagus, and skin and 15% or less in cancers such as 
those of the prostate, brain, and breast. When these data are normalized for the incidence of 
each of these 32 cancer types in the population, we calculate that 29% of the mutations in 
cancers occurring in the United Kingdom were attributable to E, 5% of the mutations were 
attributable to H, and 66% were attributable to R. Cancer Research UK estimates that 42% 
of these cancer cases are preventable. Given the mathematical relationship between cancer 
etiology and cancer preventability (see supplementary materials), the proportion of 
mutations caused by environmental factors is always less than the proportion of cancers 
preventable by avoidance of these factors. Thus, our estimate that a maximum of 29% of the 
mutations in these cancers are due to E is compatible with the estimate that 42% of these 
cancers are preventable by avoiding known risk factors.
The results described above have important ramifications for understanding the root causes 
of cancer as well as for minimizing deaths from this disease. Uniformly high correlations 
between the number of stem cell divisions and cancer risk among tissues were observed in 
countries with widely different environments. This strongly supports the idea that R 
mutations make major contributions to cancer (see also fig. S1). However, the actual 
contribution of R mutations to any particular cancer type cannot be reliably estimated from 
such correlations. The approaches described here—a combination of cancer sequencing data 
and conservative analyses of environmental and hereditary risk factors—provide such 
estimates. They indicated that even in lung adenocarcinomas, R contributes a third of the 
total mutations, with tobacco smoke (including secondhand smoke), diet, radiation, and 
occupational exposures contributing the remainder. In cancers that are less strongly 
associated with environmental factors, such as those of the pancreas, brain, bone, or prostate, 
the majority of the mutations are attributable to R.
These data and analyses should help clarify prior confusion about the relationship between 
replicative mutations and cancer (23–28). First, the data demonstrate that the correlation 
between cancer incidence and the number of stem cell divisions in various tissues cannot be 
explained by peculiarities of the U.S. population or its environment. This correlation is 
observed worldwide, as would be expected for a fundamental biological process such as 
stem cell divisions. Second, these results explicitly and quantitatively address the difference 
between cancer etiology and cancer preventability. As illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3, these 
concepts are not equivalent. A cancer in which 50% of the mutations are due to R can still be 
preventable. The reason for this is that it generally requires more than one mutation to 
develop the disease. A cancer that required two mutations is still preventable if one of the 
mutations was due to R and the other due to an avoidable environmental factor.
Our results are fully consistent with epidemiological evidence on the fraction of cancers in 
developed countries that are potentially preventable through improvements in environment 
and lifestyle. Cancer Research UK estimates that 42% of cancer cases are preventable (17);

 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 21% of annual cancer 
deaths in individuals <80 years old could be prevented (29).
Of equal importance, these studies provide a well-defined, molecular explanation for the 
large and apparently unpreventable component of cancer risk that has long puzzled 
epidemiologists. It is, of course, possible that virtually all mutations in all cancers are due to 
environmental factors, most of which have simply not yet been discovered. However, such a 
possibility seems inconsistent with the exhaustively documented fact that about three 
mutations occur every time a normal cell divides and that normal stem cells often divide 
throughout life.
Our studies complement, rather than oppose, those of classic epidemiology. For example, the 
recognition of a third, major factor (R) underlying cancer risk can inform epidemiologic 
studies by pointing to cancers that cannot yet be explained by R (i.e., those with too few 
stem cell divisions to account for cancer incidence). Such cancer types seem particularly 
well suited for further epidemiologic investigation. Additionally, R mutations appear 
unavoidable now, but it is conceivable that they will become avoidable in the future. There 
are at least four sources of R mutations in normal cells: quantum effects on base pairing 
(30), mistakes made by polymerases (31), hydrolytic deamination of bases (32), and damage 
by endogenously produced reactive oxygen species or other metabolites (33). The last of 
these could theoretically be reduced by the administration of antioxidant drugs (34). The 
effects of all four could, in principle, be reduced by introducing more efficient repair genes 
into the nuclei of somatic cells or through other creative means.
As a result of the aging of the human population, cancer is today the most common cause of 
death in the world (12). Primary prevention is the best way to reduce cancer deaths. 
Recognition of a third contributor to cancer—R mutations—does not diminish the 
importance of primary prevention but emphasizes that not all cancers can be prevented by 
avoiding environmental risk factors (Figs. 2 and 3). Fortunately, primary prevention is not 
the only type of prevention that exists or can be improved in the future. Secondary 
prevention, i.e., early detection and intervention, can also be lifesaving. For cancers in which 
all mutations are the result of R, secondary prevention is the only option.

 Fig. 1. Correlations between stem cell divisions and cancer incidence in different countries
For each country, the correlation between the number of stem cell divisions in 17 different 
tissues and the lifetime incidence of cancer in those tissues was calculated. This resulted in 
correlation coefficients, which were grouped and plotted into a histogram. In this histogram, 
the x axis represents the correlation coefficients and the y axis represents the number of 
countries with the corresponding correlation coefficient. For example, there were seven 
countries in which the correlation between the number of stem cell divisions and cancer 
incidence was between 0.82 and 0.83; these seven countries are represented by the tallest 
green bar in the histogram. The median correlation coefficient over all countries was 0.8. 
The black line represents the density for the observed distribution of the correlation 
coefficient among different countries.

 Fig. 2. Mutation etiology and cancer prevention in a hypothetical scenario and in real life
Patients exposed to environmental factors, such as cigarette smoke, are surrounded by a 
cloud. The driver gene mutations calculated to be attributable to environmental (E), 
hereditary (H), and replicative (R) factors are depicted as gray, blue (containing an “H”), and 
yellow circles, respectively. For simplicity, each cancer patient is shown as having three 
driver gene mutations, but the calculations are based on percentages. Thus, if there are three 
driver gene mutations in a cancer and R accounts for 33% of them, then one mutation is 
assigned to R. (A) A hypothetical scenario consisting of an imaginary place, Planet B, where

 powerful mutagen is then introduced that increases cancer risk 10-fold, so that 90% of 
cancers on this planet are preventable. In some individuals on this planet, all mutations are 
due to E, whereas in the two individuals in the bottom right corner, all are due to R. In the 
other patients, only some of the somatic mutations in their tumors result from E. Even 
though 90% of the cancers are preventable by eliminating the newly introduced mutagen, 
40% of the total driver gene mutations are due to R. (B to D) Real-life examples of mutation

lung adenocarcinomas that are due to environmental versus nonenvironmental factors are

are preventable (17) by eliminating E factors, we calculate that 35% (95% CI: 30 to 40%) of 
total driver gene mutations are due to factors unrelated to E or H and presumably are due to 
R. (C) The approximate proportion of driver gene mutations in pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinomas, in which hereditary factors are known to play a role. It has been estimated 
that ~37% (17) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas are preventable, but at most 18% and 
5% of the driver gene mutations in these cancers are estimated to be due to E and H, 
respectively. The remaining 77% (95% CI: 82 to 94%) of the total driver gene mutations are 
due to factors other than E or H, presumably R. (D) The approximate proportion of driver 
gene mutations in prostate cancers, in which environmental factors are thought to play 
essentially no role (17) and hereditary factors account for 5 to 9% of cases (see 
supplementary materials). None of these cancers are preventable, and less than 5% of the 
driver mutations in these cancers are due to E or H. The remaining 95% of the total driver 
gene mutations are due to factors other than E or H, presumably R. [Image: The Johns

 Fig. 3. Etiology of driver gene mutations in women with cancer
For each of 18 representative cancer types, the schematic depicts the proportion of mutations 
that are inherited, due to environmental factors, or due to errors in DNA replication (i.e., not 
attributable to either heredity or environment). The sum of these three proportions is 100%. 
The color codes for hereditary, replicative, and environmental factors are identical and span 
white (0%) to brightest red (100%). The numerical values used to construct this figure, as 
well as the values for 14 other cancer types not shown in the figure, are provided in table S6.

Table 1
Correlations between the lifetime risk of cancers in 17 tissues and the lifetime number of 
stem cell divisions in those tissues
The median Pearson’s correlation coefficients and 95% range in various geographic regions are listed. The 
values in columns CR 0–85+, CR 0–85, CR 0–80, and CR 0–75 represent the correlations when the lifetime 
risk of each cancer (cumulative risk, CR) could be determined from birth to age 85+, birth to age 85, birth to 
age 80, and birth to age 75, respectively. No cancer incidence data were available for individuals older than 80 
years in African countries (tables S1 to S4). NA, not applicable.
