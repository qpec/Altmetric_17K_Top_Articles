Abstract 
For several decades, there has been a significant need to better educate the 
public about noise pollution. A small number of small-scale studies have fo-
cused on the sound levels of restaurants and their impact on health and hear-
ing. There have also been an increasing number of media articles stating that 
eating and drinking venues are getting increasingly loud making it more dif-
ficult for people to connect with others in conversation. This study reports on 
an exploratory large-scale noise survey of sound levels of 2376 restaurants and 
bars in New York City using a novel smart-phone application and categorized 
them based on how quiet or loud they were. The results suggest that: 1) A sig-
nificant number of venues have high sound levels that are not conducive to 
conversation and may be endangering the health of patrons and employees, 2) 
that the reported sound levels by the venue managers on their online public 
business pages generally underestimated actual sound levels, and 3) the aver-
age sound levels in restaurants and bars are correlated by neighborhood and 
type of cuisine.

1. Introduction 
Noise pollution is a widespread issue that a plethora of studies, both in the 
United States and abroad, have addressed. A small number of these studies have 
focused on the sound levels of restaurants and the impact of noise on health and 
hearing. There have also been an increasing number of media articles from sev-
eral cities stating that eating and drinking establishments are getting increasingly 
loud either because of background music or architectural design that enhances 
rather than abates interior sounds [1]-[12].

This trend of increased noise can be attributed to modern design changes that 
are viewed as creating an exciting and bustling atmosphere [13]. This translates 
into more open kitchens, stripped-down or hard surfaces such as wooden floors, 
more windows, less tablecloths, no carpeting and fewer plants and paneling 
which help absorb sound. High table density with people in close proximity to 
one another and background music are also large contributors. There are also 
financial incentives for venue managers to produce higher sound levels since 
studies show that it causes people to drink more and eat faster, generating great-
er table turnover [14] [15] [16].  
High sound levels in restaurants and bars can negatively impact the health and 
quality of life of patrons and employees as hearing loss is the third most com-
mon chronic physical condition in the US [17], and noise is the most common 
“modifiable environmental cause” of hearing loss which is present in 24% of 
adults [18]. Noise is also associated with tinnitus, a noise or ringing in the ears, 
which affects approximately 11% of adults and hyperacusis, an increased sensi-
tivity to sound, which affects approximately 6% of adults [19] [20] [21]. Re-
search also shows that noise can contribute to exhaustion and also release corti-
sol in the body as it is linked to increased stress [22] [23], hypertension, ischae-
mic heart disease, stroke [24] and obesity [25].  
A recent study showed that a large number of U.S. adults may be exposed to 
noise levels above the EPA recommended daily noise dosage limit of 70 dBA 
[26]. And another study of more than 4500 adults in New York City suggested 
that nine out of ten adults exceeded the same EPA daily noise dosage limit [27]. 
To address the dangers of noise pollution, the Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) recommends avoiding prolonged exposure to loud environ-
ments to prevent noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) [18] [28]. 
Noise pollution also affects the quality of life [29]. Even for people with nor-
mal hearing, noise is a barrier to the enjoyment of communicating, socializing 
and connecting with colleagues, friends and families through intimate conversa-
tion. The focus of this study is on indoor noise, specifically in restaurants and 
bars. Restaurants are not just eating establishments, but social spaces important 
for gathering and communicating and noise has hindered and negatively af-
fected customers’ dining experience [30]. And for those with hearing loss, the 
difficulty of hearing others in loud venues can lead many to withdraw from so-
cial situations, leading to increased isolation [31].  
The number of people exposed to high sound levels has tripled since the 
1980’s [32] due, in part, to the rise of personal music players and louder restau-
rants and bars. The Speak Easy 2016 survey of 1461 people with and without 
hearing loss in the United Kingdom (UK) showed that 77% of respondents re-
ported increasing sound levels in restaurants since 2011 [33].  
There are increasing numbers of reports from patrons complaining about the 
difficulty in conversing with fellow diners due to loud venues. In Zagat’s 2016 
Annual Survey, when surveyors were asked what irritated them the most about

dining out, noise was the second highest complaint (25%) behind poor service 
(28%). But in major urban cities of San Francisco, Boston, Portland and New 
York City, noise was the number one complaint [34]. Zagat also reported that 
72% of New Yorkers actively avoid restaurants that are too loud [35]. In 2015, 
nearly 80% of 1232 surveyed people in New Orleans said they “loathe” restau-
rant noise with noise annoying them the most (27%) followed by poor service 
(24%) [36]. The Speak Easy survey also found that due to venues with loud 
noise: 1) close to eight out of ten people had left a restaurant, café or bar 2) 79% 
had difficulty holding a conversation in such venues, and 3) 91% stated they 
would not return to such a venue. Even amongst respondents with no hearing 
loss, 84% said they considered lower noise levels important when deciding where 
to eat [33]. And an organization in the UK called Pipedown that was formed to 
campaign for freedom from background music has now expanded to the U.S., 
Canada, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Holland and South Africa [37].  
Noise is clearly an important health and quality-of-life issue. The general pub-
lic could benefit from information about sound levels of a particular venue for 
both health and the ability to converse with others. Because many may not know 
specifically which sound levels comprise a quiet or loud auditory environment, 
they may be unknowingly endangering their health by patronizing an establish-
ment they believe to be quiet but is actually loud.  
The advances of smart-phone technology is providing new ways to capture 
sound levels with digital sound level meters which could become a valuable tool 
for improving the public’s noise pollution awareness [18]. Ideally, a database 
would be maintained by a local governmental entity and have frequent and re-
curring precise sound level measurements of long duration for all venues in a 
city. And similar to the health grades that are prominently displayed on venue 
windows, a noise grade would enable patrons to know the general sound level of 
each venue. Unfortunately, this is impractical due to the high costs of labor, 
equipment and time. While some people do employ a digital sound level meter 
on their smart phone to take real-time measurements, such data is not collected, 
aggregated and widely disseminated for public consumption. What is suggested 
is a method to systematically quantify the noise levels of a large number of ve-
nues employing digital sound level meters and making such information easily 
accessible to the public.  
A few studies have attempted to undertake a systematic quantification of res-
taurant and bar sound levels in an urban environment, but the number of ve-
nues measured were rather small using less than 100 restaurants, ranging from 
Lebo’s study of 27 restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1994 [38], Yu 
and Wong’s study of 23 restaurants in Hong Kong in 2002 [39], Hannah’s study 
of five restaurants in Wellington, New Zealand in 2004 [40], Ryberg’s study of 96 
pubs and restaurants in Sweden in 2009 but only those with loud music were 
analyzed [41], Samagwa’s study of seven restaurants in Morogoro, Tanzania in 
2009 [42]. To and Chung’s study of 12 restaurants in Hong Kong in 2014 [43],

and Nielsen’s study of five restaurants in Denmark in 2016 [13]. 
Because these studies were based on a small number of restaurants and were 
not conducted on a continuing basis, the data collected do not accurately 
represent current sound levels and do not help people determine which venues 
are quiet or loud. In addition, such information is not easily accessible to the 
public. Some online websites that rank or describe restaurants and bars such as 
Yelp do show a venue’s sound levels, but when information is included, it is 
based on subjective interpretation and reporting by venue managers and/or pa-
trons. Such information may not provide accurate data about sound levels.  
This exploratory study is based on an effort to capture the sound level data on 
a large-scale basis in an urban environment (New York City) using the 
SoundPrint app (“SoundPrint”), a free digital sound level meter available on the 
iPhone at no cost to users, that measures, aggregates, categorizes and displays 
the average sound levels of venues into quiet, moderate, loud or very loud cate-
gories on an ongoing basis and is easily accessible to the public.  
We believe the public lacks sufficient awareness in determining whether a 
certain auditory environment is quiet or loud. For most people without digital 
sound level meters, such determination is merely subjective. If most venues are 
loud, people may erroneously believe that such noise levels are the “norm” and 
therefore, acceptable and safe. This study aims to compare people’s subjective 
interpretation and reporting of sound levels to actual quantitative measure-
ments.  
Another purpose of this study is to determine whether the recent increase in 
the number of media articles and qualitative surveys indicating that venues are 
too loud is true and accurate. In answering this, data from SoundPrint was uti-
lized to explore the following: 1) What percentage of venues in Manhattan are 
quiet or loud? 2) Are there certain types of venues or venues in certain neigh-
borhoods that are generally quieter or louder than others? And 3) Do managers 
and/or patrons accurately assess and report the sound levels of these venues?  
2. Methodology 
1) Timeline and Geography 
The exploratory study was conducted between July 2015 and June 2017 in 
Manhattan restaurants and bars located between 86th street and the lower edge of 
Manhattan, otherwise known as the Financial District. Manhattan was chosen 
for two reasons. First it has a large number of restaurants and bars in a concen-
trated area making it easier to carry out the large-scale exploratory survey. And 
second, for its reputation as one of the noisiest cities worldwide. Note that the 
collection is still ongoing, but for the purposes of this study, June 2017 is the last 
month of data analyzed for this report.  
The major neighborhoods in Manhattan that were assessed include: Upper 
West Side, Upper East Side, Midtown West, Midtown East, Murray Hill, Korea-
town, Chelsea, Flatiron, Gramercy, Union Square, West Village, East Village,

Tribeca, SoHo, Chinatown, Little Italy, Lower East Side and the Financial Dis-
trict1.  
2) Venues measured  
A total of 3137 restaurants and bars were measured at least once for their 
sound levels. To qualify for inclusion in the analysis, however, each venue had to 
be measured a minimum of three times during prime days and hours and many 
were measured more than three times2,3. A total of 2376 restaurants and bars met 
this minimum requirement for inclusion in this report. Only restaurants that 
had on-the-premise seating with waiter-based service were included in this 
analysis; venues that had pick-up-at-the-counter service or no waiters were ex-
cluded.  
There are several reasons why a venue may not have been measured the 
minimum three times: a) the venue launched their business after the beginning 
of the collection stage, thus were not measured at least three times b) the venue 
was either permanently or temporarily closed (i.e. private event, remodeling, or 
changed locations), or c) the collector missed the venue when surveying the se-
lected neighborhood or streets.  
3) Instrument of measurement  
The measurements were conducted with the SoundPrint app, a free digital 
sound level meter and aggregator available on the iPhone platform. SoundPrint 
measures dBA with slow response and automates the sound level calibration 
across different iPhone hardware devices for a more consistent measurement. 
The main output is the average dBA (an arithmetic average) as this represents 
sufficient information for individuals to measure, understand and employ in 
making decisions about whether to patronize a venue.  
To illustrate, the average dBA output is the result of collecting the average 
dBA of each individual measurement, and averaging across those measurements. 
To illustrate, if one venue had three separate average measurements of 72 dBA, 
74 dBA and 78 dBA, then the venue’s dBA used for this analysis would be 75 
dBA.  
The SoundPrint app’s sound level measurement accuracy was tested in two 
separate ways. First the app’s sound measurement capabilities were tested side 
by side with a Type-1 sound level meter at various levels of pink noise. Agree-
ment was within ± 0 - 1.2 dB at all levels4. And second, it was compared to the 
 
1The West Village is comprised of the West Village and Greenwich Village. Flatiron/Gramercy also 
includes Union Square and SoHo includes Nolita. 
2The highest number of times a venue was measured was 18. 
3The breakdown of the number of venues measured “x” times is as follows: 1 measurement: 366 ve-
nues; 2 measurements: 395 venues; 3 measurements: 861 venues; 4 measurements: 718 venues; 5 mea-
surements: 381 venues; 6 measurements: 233 venues; 7 measurements: 107 venues; 8 measurements: 48 
venues; 9 measurements: 18 venues; 10 measurements: 4 venues; 11 measurements: 2 venues; 12 mea-
surements: 0 venues; 13 measurements: 1 venue; 14 measurements, 0 venues; 15 measurements, 1 ve-
nue; 16 measurements, 1 venue; 17 measurements, 0 venues; and 18 measurements, 1 venue. 
4The tests were conducted using four iPhone 6 models and an iPhone 7 by Lily M. Wang and Kieren 
Smith (Durham School of Architectural Engineering and Construction, University of Ne-
braska-Lincoln).

Faber Sound Meter 4 iPhone app, referred to as the SoundMeter app and availa-
ble on the Apple store, which was found by Chuck Kardous at NIOSH to be the 
most accurate within 0.2% of an OSHA-certified sound level meter [44]. Results 
show that across seven different general static sound level decibel ranges, 
SoundPrint was within ± 0 - 1 dBA of the SoundMeter app5. 
SoundPrint allows the user to see the average sound level of an individual ve-
nue that has been measured and submitted to the database. Users can see the 
sound levels of individual venues in the SoundPrint app in three ways: a) in a list 
sorted by sound levels (how quiet or loud they are) b) on a visual map showing 
the sound levels of venues in a certain geographical area (i.e. East Village), or c) 
by searching for a specific venue by name in the search bar. Note that the sound 
levels of individual venues available in SoundPrint are not shown or analyzed in 
this study, only aggregated data is.  
4) How measurements were taken and submitted  
To take a measurement, the 24 collectors, recruited through friends and post-
ing sites, were instructed to measure from a central spot in the venue. If this was 
deemed not to be an effective location by the collector, then the measurement 
took place closer to the source of the ambient sound. The collector was in-
structed to ensure that there was at least three feet of space extending outward in 
all radial and azimuthal angles from the microphone during the measurement. 
Note that regular users of the SoundPrint app also crowdsourced their sound 
level measurements to the database.  
Each measurement is run for a minimum duration of 15 seconds and calcu-
lates the average sound level over the length of the measurement. Note that 
while the minimum duration is 15 seconds, the collector was instructed to 
measure for the amount of time necessary to sufficiently reflect the actual sound 
level. Thus, many of the measurements exceeded 15 seconds. When the collector 
ended the measurement, he or she then tagged the measurement to the venue 
name and submitted it to the SoundPrint database. The database then produced 
an arithmetic average sound level for each venue based on all the submitted 
measurements tagged to the venue.  
5) Measurement collections 
The measurements were collected during prime-time days and hours which 
included: Wednesdays from 7:00PM-9:00PM, Thursdays from 7:00PM-9:30PM, 
Fridays from 7:00PM-10:00PM and Saturdays from 7:00PM-10:00PM.  
6) Sound level categories  
As shown in Table 1
Table 1, the data is segmented into four sound level categories: a) 
Quiet b) Moderate c) Loud d) Very Loud.  
All four categories have sound level thresholds that are guided by hearing 
health safety standards, but the Moderate and Loud categories are also guided by 
 
5Note that SoundPrint measures dBA in whole integers whereas SoundMeter measures to the 1/10th 
decibel. To illustrate, in a quiet room where SoundMeter measured at 43.8 dBA, it was rounded to 
44 dBA. SoundPrint measured at 45 dBA. We do not know if SoundPrint’s dBA to the 1/10th level 
was 44.5, 44.6, 44.7, 44.8, 44.9, 45.0, 45.1, 45.2, 45.3, or 45.4.

the threshold sound level where the ability to hear and converse with others be-
comes either easier or difficult. Note that the Discussion section discusses and 
compares SoundPrint’s four categories of Quiet, Moderate, Loud, and Very 
Loud to Yelp’s four noise level categories of Quiet, Average, Loud and Very 
Loud.  
i) Less than 70 dBA (Quiet)  
In 1972, The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) 
stated that average, not peak, sound levels over a time-weighted eight-hour pe-
riod above 85 dBA is the threshold by which employers should enact hearing 
conservation programs to protect against the danger of noise induced hearing 
loss. This was a standard specifically set for employers and employees in occupa-
tional settings for the standard eight-hour work day. Yet guidelines were also 
needed for the general public to account for their noise exposure for the full 
24-hours in a day. Two years later, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
calculated a safe noise exposure level for the general public on a daily basis to be 
70 dBA [45]. This means that, on average, during a typical 24-hour day, one’s 
noise exposure should be 70 dBA or lower to protect against noise-induced 
hearing loss according to the EPA. This threshold has been supported by the 
World Health Organization (WHO) that has recommended people avoid sound 
level exposures above 70 dBA [46]. Hence the Quiet category reflects an average 
dBA of 70 or lower.  
ii) 81 dBA or louder (Very Loud)  
Notwithstanding the above, NIOSH’s 85 dBA standard is not meant to protect 
all workers as NIOSH acknowledged that 8% of workers could still develop ma-
terial hearing loss under their guidelines. Also, the 85 dBA threshold level as-
sumes that the employee has no further noise exposure during the remaining 16 
non-working hours each day and accounted for only 40 occupational-work years 
for noise exposure rather than the 80-year life expectancy today [47] [48]. In 
2003, the European Parliament established new, and more stringent, standards 
for acceptable occupational noise exposure levels as it lowered the threshold by 
which companies must make hearing protection available from 85 dBA to 80 
dBA [49]. Thus, SoundPrint employs the more conservative 80 dBA as the thre-
shold for a venue being Very Loud and potentially dangerous to one’s hearing 
health.  
iii) Between 71 and 75 dBA (Moderate) and Between 76 and 80 dBA (Loud)  
The EPA has shown that normal hearing people have difficulty following a 
conversation above 75 dBA [45]. This is supported by Lebo et al.’s description of 
restaurants with noise levels of 75+ dBA as those that made conversation diffi-
cult for patrons with normal hearing and very difficult for those with hearing 
loss [38]. Loud noise could alternatively be described as an auditory environ-
ment where people must raise their voice to be heard by someone sitting within 
three feet of them. And in 1990, The National Institute of Health Consensus 
Development Conference on Noise and Hearing Loss stated that 75 dBA is the 
 G. Scott 
 
 
DOI: 10.4236/jss.2018.68005 
71 
Open Journal of Social Sciences 
 
threshold by which, if the sound level is lower, is unlikely to cause permanent 
hearing loss [50]. This implies that as the sound level increases above 75 dBA, 
the likelihood of incurring permanent hearing loss increases. Hence SoundPrint 
sets 75 dBA as the threshold between the Moderate and Loud categories.  
An alternative interpretation for the Loud category is that it could represent 
an auditory environment that is more likely to be conducive to a fun, exciting 
atmosphere with lively music, lots of people in attendance, and loud conversa-
tion or shouting.  
In summary, the four sound level categories are: i) 70 dBA or lower (Quiet) ii) 
Between 71 - 75 dBA (Moderate) iii) Between 76 and 80 dBA (Loud), and iv) 81 
dBA or higher (Very Loud).  
The presentation of the data in this study is represented as Low, Moderate and 
High with the High category separated into two categories, Loud and Very Loud. 
The High category reflects the sound level threshold above 76 dBA and, as the 
dBA level increases, the likelihood of incurring noise-induced hearing loss in-
creases and the ability to converse with others becomes more difficult.  
7) Restaurant classifications  
The analysis also categorizes restaurants by various classifications that include 
user ratings, cost, ambience and type of cuisine. This information was gleamed 
from each venues’ business listing on the Yelp website (“Yelp”) which displays 
the aforementioned variables.  
8) Analysis of managers and/or patrons’ assessment and reporting of venue’s 
sound levels 
The study also attempts to gauge the accuracy of the manager and patron’s 
reporting of a venue’s sound level. When filling out their business listing survey 
on Yelp, managers can choose one of four sound level categories: Quiet, Aver-
age, Loud or Very Loud. Patrons, or a Yelp reviewer, can subsequently fill out a 
similar survey when writing a Yelp review. Note that Yelp does not assist the us-
er in providing the associated numerical dBA range associated with each sound 
level category. Instead it relies on the subjective assessment and reporting of the 
manager and/or patron.  
The data was collected and analyzed as follows: First, the venue’s sound level 
categorization was quantitatively measured and categorized by SoundPrint as 
either Quiet, Moderate, Loud or Very Loud. Then this categorization was com-
pared to Yelp’s sound level categories.

A venue manager’s reporting was marked as “Matched” when the venue’s 
Yelp business listing reported the same sound level category as SoundPrint’s ca-
tegorization. For example, if SoundPrint measured “John Smith Restaurant” as 
having an average sound level of 69 dBA over three submitted measurements, it 
would be categorized as Quiet. And if “John Smith Restaurant’s” Yelp business 
page reported the sound level as Quiet, then it was marked as “Matched.” If the 
venue had listed itself as Average, Loud, or Very Loud, then it was marked as 
“Mismatched.” Similarly, if SoundPrint categorized a venue as either Loud or 
Very Loud and the venue’s Yelp business page reported the sound level as either 
Loud or Very Loud, then it was marked as “Matched.” But if it was reported as 
Quiet or Average, then it was marked as “Mismatched.”  
9) Limitations  
There are several limitations to this exploratory study. First, the SoundPrint 
digital sound level meter app was used rather than a highly advanced sound level 
measuring instrument. Although SoundPrint provides a reasonable approximate 
measurement of the sound level, it is not sufficiently accurate for legally-based 
measurements. Second, only one variable, the average dBA was measured and 
aggregated as other variables that could provide additional insight such as min-
imum or maximum sound levels, occupational density and/or reverberation or 
other room characteristics such as clarity were not measured. Third, the length 
of the recordings is typically shorter than the measurements conducted in prior 
restaurant noise studies. This was due to the restrictive timeframe for primetime 
days and hours, the large number of venues needed for measurement at least 
three times and the limited amount of human resources to complete the mea-
surements.  
Fourth, there is no uniform recording length for each submission as the length 
of the recording varies since it the user’s decision as to when to stop each re-
cording, despite there being a minimum 15 seconds. The vast majority of sub-
missions were under one minute. Fifth, due to the nature of the app being a 
crowdsourcing app and despite giving instructions to collectors and users, there 
is not a verifiable way to ensure they followed precise instructions (i.e. record 
from the center of the room, ensure at least three feet of space in a 360 degree 
angle) during their measurements. Additionally, the resulting average sound le-
vels for a particular venue could differ from the sound levels during other times 
on the same day. It is possible that a collector took a measurement of a venue 
that was quieter or louder at a specific time and then an hour later the venue 
produces a louder or quieter sound level that may be more typical for the venue.

managers and/or patrons, as gleaned from the venue’s Yelp business listing.  
In detail, Table 2
Table 2 and Table 
Table 3 show the percentage breakdown by sound level 
categories of “All Restaurants” and “Mainstream Restaurants.” The tables also 
show the breakdown by neighborhood to enable comparisons between different 
areas in Manhattan. Table 2
Table 2 represents all the restaurant venues in the study. The 
study analyzed restaurants that had waiter-based service and on-the-premise din-
ing for patrons. However, some of these restaurants also offered takeout and de-
livery options and generated much of their revenue from one of these two op-
tions. It became evident to collectors that these restaurants were often either rel-
atively empty or had minimal patrons dining on the premises, which meant the 
sound level often measured as Quiet.  
These venues do not represent the type of restaurant the study targets, which 
are those that generate their business primarily from customers dining 
on-the-premises. Consequently, a second category titled “Mainstream Restau-
rants”, was formed as an alternative, but not exact, approach to analyze restau-
rants that were mainly on-the-premise dining establishments. The restaurants

that earned most of their business via takeout and delivery, and also had 
on-the-premise seating with mostly empty tables, were predominantly Asian and 
Indian cuisine-based restaurants. Thus, the Mainstream Restaurant table ex-
cludes all Asian and Indian restaurants at the expense of excluding those Asian 
and Indian restaurants that generate most of their revenue via on-the-premise 
dining.  
4. Results  
1) Restaurants  
For restaurants, as shown in Table 2
Table 2, including those that have a significant 
delivery and take-out presence, 10% of the venues are Quiet, 27% are Moderate, 
and 63% are High with 38% being Loud and 25% Very Loud6. The average 
sound level for all restaurants was 77 dBA.  
2) Mainstream Restaurants (On-the-Premise Dining) 
For Mainstream Restaurants, as shown in Table 3
Table 3, 6% are Quiet, 23% are 
Moderate, 71% are High with 40% being Loud and 31% Very Loud. The average 
sound level for all mainstream restaurants was 78 dBA.  
Many of the neighborhoods below 34th Street (excluding the Financial District, 
Little Italy and Chinatown) tend to be louder than those above 34th Street. On 
the Lower East Side of Manhattan, 0% of the restaurants measured are Quiet, 9% 
are Moderate and 91% are High with 38% being Loud and 54% being Very Loud. 
The Lower East Side, Tribeca, SoHo, Chelsea, East Village, West Village, Flatiron 
and Murray Hill all have +70% of their venues in the High category. Not surpri-
singly, these neighborhoods also have the highest average sound levels for res-
taurants. In contrast, neighborhoods above 34th Street, except Murray Hill, such 
as the Upper West Side, Upper East Side, Midtown East and Midtown West tend 
to have a lower percentage of venues in the High category and also lower average 
sound levels.  
3) Bars 
For bars, as shown in Table 4
Table 4, 2% are Quiet, 8% are Moderate and 90% are 
High with 31% being Loud and 60% Very Loud. The average sound level for all 
bars was 81 dBA. Segmenting the data into neighborhoods shows a similar pat-
tern consistent with the restaurant data as the same neighborhoods tend to have 
higher sound levels than their uptown brethren above 34th Street.  
4) Restaurants by Cost, User Ratings, Ambience and Cuisine  
For restaurants segmented by User Ratings, as shown in Table 5
Table 5, a positive 
correlation was found between sound levels and User Ratings, and while statis-
tically significant at the p<0.01 level, the relationship is not strong (R = 0.093). 
For restaurants segmented by Cost, as shown in Table 6
Table 6, there was no statisti-
cally significant relationship found between the price of a venue and the average 
sound level experienced. For restaurants segmented by Ambience, as shown in 
Table 7
Table 7, the different ambiences are associated with differences in sound levels, 
 
6Throughout this analysis, percentages may not add to 100% due to rounding.

confirmed by a significant (p = 0.000) one-way ANOVA test and Games-Howell 
post-hoc values (all significant at the p < 0.05 level). Trendy, Classy and Upscale 
(TCU) restaurants are associated with the highest levels, Intimate with the low-
est and Casual between the two.  
For restaurants segmented by Cuisine, as shown in Table 8
Table 8, the different cui-
sine types were found to have statistically significant differences in measured 
sound level. An ANOVA test conducted with the different cuisine groups was 
found to be highly significant (p = 0.000). Indian (73 dBA), Chinese (73 dBA), 
Vietnamese (73 dBA) and Japanese (74 dBA) restaurants comprise the relatively 
quieter restaurants compared to the Mexican (80 dBA), Latin (79 dBA), Ameri-
can (79 dBA), Spanish (79 dBA), Korean (78 dBA) and Mediterranean (77 dBA) 
restaurants.  
5) Manager’s assessment and reporting of sound levels 
For the Quiet venues, as shown in Table 9
Table 9, 26% of the Yelp venue listings 
matched with SoundPrint’s data as being Quiet and 74% mismatched as a cate-
gory other than Quiet. For the Loud or Very Loud venues, 7% matched with 
SoundPrint’s data as being Loud or Very Loud and 93% mismatched with 
SoundPrint’s data.  
5. Discussion 
1) A significant majority of restaurants are likely too loud for conversation 
and connecting with others  
As Tables 2
Tables 2-4 suggest, the number of venues that are Loud or Very Loud is 
significantly high. For Mainstream Restaurants, 71% produce average sound le-
vels above the threshold that is likely to be too difficult to have a conversation 
without the need to raise one’s voice. This is supported by the average sound 
level being 78 dBA which means that if a patron were to patronize a randomly 
selected restaurant during peak days and hours in Manhattan, it would likely be 
Loud. Also, a significant majority of bars (90%) are also Loud or Very Loud.  
This data lends credence to the anecdotal comments, recent surveys and in-
creasing number of media articles that suggest that restaurants and bars are most 
often too loud for conversation and socializing.  
2) A significant number of restaurants and bars are dangerous to people’s 
hearing health  
Approximately 31% of Mainstream restaurants and 60% of all bars have 
sound levels during peak days and hours that are potentially dangerous to the 
hearing health of their patrons, and even more importantly, to their employees 
(i.e. waiters, hostesses, bartenders, chefs and managers) who are often subject to 
a longer duration of exposure to occupational noise. The average sound level of a 
Manhattan bar is 81 dBA which means that if a person were to patronize a ran-
domly selected bar during peak days and hours in Manhattan, it would likely be 
Very Loud.  
A venue employee’s hearing health could be in serious jeopardy since 
 G. Scott  
 
 
DOI: 10.4236/jss.2018.68005 
78 
Open Journal of Social Sciences 
 
noise-induced hearing loss often does not appear until years later, which by then 
is too late [51] [52]. And for patrons, their hearing health also depends greatly 
on the amount and degree of noise exposure they experience during the rest of 
their 24-hour day, that is whether their average daily noise exposure falls below 
the 70 dBA threshold recommended by the EPA.  
3) Some neighborhoods are louder than others  
Manhattan neighborhoods are well-known for their diversity and that is also 
reflected in the data. Neighborhoods known to skew younger in age and those 
that have a more vibrant nightlife also tend to have a higher percentage of res-
taurants that are Loud or Very Loud including the Lower East Side, SoHo, East 
Village, West Village, Chelsea, Flatiron and Murray Hill—all have more than 
75% of their venues as Loud or Very Loud.  
That these neighborhoods are comparatively louder than other neighborhoods 
is not a surprise. The Upper West Side and Upper East Side are known to be 
more family-oriented, residential, skew older in age and have less of a vibrant 
night life. Midtown West and Midtown East are neighborhoods with a mix of 
residential units and business offices with less people frequenting restaurants 
during the evening hours compared to the daytime. There are still a good num-
ber of venues that are well attended in the evenings, just less so compared to 
their downtown brethren.  
This data could assist people by informing them of the neighborhoods that 
have quieter or noisier restaurants and bars based on their sound level prefe-
rence and could be a deciding factor in choosing which neighborhood to live in. 
The data could also assist local governance in Manhattan, notably the commu-
nity boards that represent certain districts and recommend various policies to 
government agencies. These community boards now have access to data that, 
should they deem it an important health issue, could help them undertake and 
direct noise pollution awareness efforts.  
4) User Ratings, Cost and Ambience trends  
Table 5
Table 5 suggests that High user-rated restaurants are louder than Average 
user-rated restaurants which are higher than Low user-rated restaurants. This is 
not surprising as one may expect that more people attend higher rated restau-
rants but without accounting for occupational density, this cannot be truly 
tested. The statistical correlation between the two factors can only account for 
approximately 9% of the variation in the sound level, so the relationship is not 
strong.  
Table 6
Table 6 suggests that Average priced restaurants tend to be louder than Mod-
erate, Expensive and Cheap restaurants. We hypothesize that more people pa-
tronize an Average priced restaurant compared to a Moderate or Expensive one 
and hence such restaurants are more crowded. However, when a statistical cor-
relation was run, there was no significant relationship found.  
Table 7
Table 7 suggests that Intimate restaurants are quieter than Casual or Trendy, 
Classy or Upscale ones. The collectors noted that Intimate restaurants tended to 
 G. Scott 
 
 
DOI: 10.4236/jss.2018.68005 
79 
Open Journal of Social Sciences 
 
have lower table density, more carpeting and tablecloths and lower or less back-
ground music. However, each individual restaurant was not quantifiably sur-
veyed based on these features and hence this trend cannot be deemed to be a re-
liable predictor of sound levels. The differences between the means of the values 
in the three categories were found to be statistically different from one another.  
5) Restaurants serving certain cuisines types may be louder or quieter than 
others  
Table 8
Table 8 suggests that restaurants may be quieter or louder based on their Cui-
sine Type. This is not surprising since the collectors observed that Indian, Chi-
nese and Japanese restaurants tended to have less background music, more car-
peting and tablecloths to absorb sound and that the patrons tended not to talk as 
loud compared to patrons of venues with different cuisines. Whether the latter 
was due to less background music that would otherwise require patrons to raise 
their voices, otherwise known as the Lombard effect, or due to the type of people 
who patronize these venues who tend to be quieter cannot be determined with-
out resorting to cultural stereotypes (i.e. Latin, Greek, American and Korean 
venues tend to have patrons who are louder).  
Thus, if a patron desires a quieter restaurant, their chances of finding one is 
likely to be greater at either Indian or Chinese venues.  
6) Accuracy of sound level reporting by managers and/or patrons  
Table 9
Table 9 suggests that user-based subjective reporting of sound levels by man-
agers and/or reviewers on Yelp does not match the objective measurements of 
Sound Print’s data: a) 74% of Sound Print’s Quiet venues are reportedly mis-
matched as being Average, Loud, or Very Loud on Yelp, and b) 93% of Sound 
Print’s Loud or Very Loud venues are reportedly mismatched as being either 
Quiet or Average.  
This suggests that the general public lacks sufficient awareness about what 
constitutes a quiet or loud auditory environment. Consequently, should people 
be relying on such subjective interpretation, they may be unknowingly placing 
themselves in Loud or Very Loud auditory environments they believe to be 
Quiet or Moderate which could be dangerous to their hearing health.  
7) Sound level trends over time—to be determined  
There appears to be an increase in the sound levels of restaurants over the past 
10 years as noted by the number of articles in the media, qualitative surveys and 
anecdotal comments about the so-called “increasing din” of restaurants. Thus, it 
would be beneficial to quantifiably gauge whether restaurants are actually getting 
louder over time. Because this is the first exploratory study, we cannot determine 
trends or make comparisons at this time. However, we aim to collect additional 
data and conduct comparative analyses to this study’s data on an annual or bi-
ennial basis in the future.  
6. Conclusion and Recommendations 
In this exploratory study, the data suggests that the increasing number of media 
 G. Scott  
 
 
DOI: 10.4236/jss.2018.68005 
80 
Open Journal of Social Sciences 
 
articles and anecdotal comments from qualitative noise surveys about sound le-
vels being too loud are correct. In New York City, a significant number of res-
taurants and bars in New York City have average sound levels that 1) approach 
levels that are too difficult for patrons to have a conversation without the need to 
raise their voice and 2) approach levels that are known to be dangerous to hear-
ing health. The average dBA for all restaurants included in this study is 77 dBA, 
for mainstream restaurants 78 dBA, and for all bars is 81 dBA. A person ran-
domly walking into a restaurant or a bar in New York City during prime days 
and hours is more likely than not to encounter a Loud or Very Loud auditory 
environment.  
Furthermore, the sound levels of venues in New York City tend to be corre-
lated with certain neighborhoods, possibly as a reflection of the venues in that 
neighborhood that attract a certain demographic. The sound levels also tend to 
be correlated with types of ethnic cuisines, possibly reflecting certain cultural 
preferences for the type of dining experience that appeal to the venue owners 
and patrons. Further investigation is needed to support these findings, notably 
by conducting measurements using precision sound level meters, measuring 
more variables including minimum and maximum sound levels, occupational 
density and reverberation, as well as measuring a significantly larger number of 
restaurants and bars compared to the number measured in the smaller scale 
noise surveys. The relationship between sound levels and other variables such as 
a venue’s user rating, cost or ambience also need to be explored on a large scale.  
The data also suggests that venue managers and patrons are not very accurate 
in assessing and reporting the actual sound levels of venues—93% of venues that 
are either Loud or Very Loud by SoundPrint’s objective measurements were re-
portedly mismatched, on a qualitative basis, as either Quiet or Average. This 
means that people may be patronizing or working in venues that are Loud or 
Very Loud that they mistakenly believe to be Quiet or Moderate.  
Because traditional scientific sound level measurement practices are time and 
labor-intensive, it has made large-scale collection of sound level data on indi-
vidual venues difficult. This results in a public today that has lacked accessibility 
to and knowledge about the sound levels of venues in their neighborhood. Such 
access is needed to help people determine whether a particular venue is likely to 
be quiet or loud, whether for social purposes (to be able to have a conversation) 
or to protect their hearing health. But with the advent of smartphone technolo-
gy, the public now has the available tools, via digital sound level meters, to col-
lect, crowdsource and create large sets of evidence-based sound level data for re-

awareness.
