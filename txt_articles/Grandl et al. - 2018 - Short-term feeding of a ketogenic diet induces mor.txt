Key points
r A ketogenic diet is known to lead to weight loss and is considered metabolically healthy;
however there are conflicting reports on its effect on hepatic insulin sensitivity.
r KD fed animals appear metabolically healthy in the fasted state after 3 days of dietary challenge,
whereas obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) fed animals show elevated insulin levels.
r A glucose challenge reveals that both KD and HFD fed animals are glucose intolerant.
r Glucose intolerance correlates with increased lipid oxidation and lower respiratory exchange
ratio (RER); however, all animals respond to glucose injection with an increase in RER.
r Hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamps with double tracer show that the effect of KD is a
result of hepatic insulin resistance and increased glucose output but not impaired glucose
clearance or tissue glucose uptake in other tissues.
Abstract Despite being a relevant healthcare issue and heavily investigated, the aetiology of
type 2 diabetes (T2D) is still incompletely understood. It is well established that increased end-
ogenous glucose production (EGP) leads to a progressive increase in glucose levels, causing insulin
resistance and eventual loss of glucose homeostasis. The consumption of high carbohydrate,
high-fat, western style diet (HFD) is linked to the development of T2D and obesity, whereas the
consumption of a low carbohydrate, high-fat, ketogenic diet (KD) is considered healthy. However,
several days of carbohydrate restriction are known to cause selective hepatic insulin resistance. In
the present study, we compare the effects of short-term HFD and KD feeding on glucose homeo-
stasis in mice. We show that, even though KD fed animals appear to be healthy in the fasted state,

they exhibit decreased glucose tolerance to a greater extent than HFD fed animals. Furthermore,
we show that this effect originates from blunted suppression of hepatic glucose production by
insulin, rather than impaired glucose clearance and tissue glucose uptake. These data suggest that
the early effects of HFD consumption on EGP may be part of a normal physiological response to
increased lipid intake and oxidation, and that systemic insulin resistance results from the addition
of dietary glucose to EGP-derived glucose.

Introduction
Despite being one of the pressing healthcare challenges
of our time, the aetiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is
still incompletely understood. Although the proximate
cause of T2D is the failure of the pancreatic islet to
increase or maintain insulin production, the ultimate
cause has not yet been conclusively identified. Overall,
there is a link between an unhealthy Western diet and
a lack of physical activity, and the development of T2D
(van Dam et al. 2002). In terms of the progression of the
disease, T2D manifests as a slow and worsening decrease
of insulin sensitivity affecting multiple organs, during
which time blood glucose levels are maintained within
normal levels, whereas insulin levels rise to compensate,
followed by the eventual failure of the pancreatic islet.
Several groups report impairment of systemic glucose
tolerance, as well as insulin signalling, in the brain or
liver after only a very few days of feeding an obesogenic
high-fat diet (HFD) to rodents, with the diet typically
consisting of 60% of calories from fat and �20% each
from protein and carbohydrates (Wang et al. 2001; Ono
et al. 2008; Clegg et al. 2011; Wiedemann et al. 2013).
These early impairments of glucose homeostasis typically
present as a failure of elevated glucose or insulin levels
to supress hepatic glucose output, leading to decreased
glucose tolerance. The development of profound insulin
resistance in the major metabolic organs muscle and
adipose tissue takes longer and has been linked to
inflammation (Rask-Madsen & Kahn, 2012). By contrast,
the manifestation of systemic glucose intolerance, as a
consequence of starvation or the ingestion of very low
carbohydrate, ketogenic diets (KD) for several days, has
been recognized for at least a century in animals and
humans and is termed starvation diabetes (Peters, 1945;
Lundbaek, 1948). Starvation diabetes was shown to be
linked to an increase in hepatic gluconeogenesis by tracer
studies in humans (Fery et al. 1990), yet any mention
of the term starvation diabetes or the citation of related
studies is absent from the recent literature concerning the
effects of longer-term KD feeding on glucose tolerance
and insulin sensitivity. Even though the efficacy of chronic
KD feeding with respect to causing weight loss is accepted
(Rosenheck et al. 2005; Nordmann et al. 2006; Hession
et al. 2009; Santos et al. 2012; Paoli et al. 2013), there
is significant controversy about its effect on glucose
tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Kennedy et al. (2007)
showed that KD improved glucose tolerance and insulin
signalling in mice compared to mice maintained on a
HFD for 12 weeks. Badman et al. (2009) showed that KD
increases glucose sensitivity in ob/ob mice independently
of weight loss. On the other hand, Jornayvaz et al. (2010)
showed that, in C57BL/6 mice, 5 weeks on a KD induced
hepatic insulin resistance, decreased glucose tolerance,
and increased gluconeogenesis, despite preventing weight
gain and increasing energy expenditure. Furthermore,
Garbow et al. (2011) found increased hepatic steatosis
and inflammation, as well as decreased glucose tolerance,
despite high muscle and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity,
in mice on a KD for 12 weeks. Given the similar
reported effects on hepatic gluconeogenesis in starvation
diabetes and mice maintained KD for several weeks, as
well as reported metabolic abnormalities of mice fed an
obesogenic HFD for several days, we aimed to address
the controversy surrounding KD feeding by analysing the
effects of short-term feeding on glucose tolerance and
insulin sensitivity and comparing it with obesogenic HFD.
Methods
Ethical approval
All mouse experiments described in the present study were
carriedoutinstrictaccordancewiththerecommendations
in the Animal Welfare Ordinance (TSchV 455.1) of the
Swiss Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office. The study
was approved by the Zurich Cantonal Veterinary Office,
Switzerland. Animals were administered buprenorphin
(Temgesic; 50–100 μg kg–1) for analgesia prior to
surgery and were anaesthetized during surgery with iso-
flurane (4–5% for induction, 1.5–2.5% for maintenance).
Post-surgery animals were injected with glucosaline
(glucose in physiological 0.9% saline) (300 μL) and
5 mg kg–1 carprofen daily. Animals were killed by cervical
dislocation or CO2 asphyxiation in slowly rising levels of
CO2. The investigators understand the ethical principles

confirm that their work complies with the animal ethics
checklist outlined in Grundy (2015).
Animals
C57BL/6 mice were housed in a pathogen-free animal
facility under a 12:12 h light/dark cycle (lights off 07.00 h)
at an ambient temperature of 23°C with free access
to food and water. Mice were obtained from Charles
River (Wilmington, MA, USA) at �6–8 weeks old and
housed in the animal facility until beginning of the
experiment at 12 weeks of age. Mice were fed standard
chow (purified diet #2222; Kliba-Nafag, Kaiseraugst,
Switzerland; 18% protein, 7% fat, 58% carbohydrate by
mass), a ketogenic diet with 90% of calories derived from
fat (Teklan TD.96355; Envigo, Huntingdon, UK; 15.3%
protein, 67.4% fat, 0.6% carbohydrate by mass), or a 60%
calories high-fat diet (purified diet #2127; Kliba-Nafag;
23.9% protein, 35% fat, 23.2% carbohydrate by mass).
For the present study 149 mice were killed.
Plasma collection
Bloodwascollectedfromthetailveinintotubescontaining
0.5 M EDTA and centrifuged to derive plasma. For post
mortem blood collection, animals were killed by CO2
asphyxiation and blood was taken by heart puncture.
Plasma analysis
Blood glucose was measured using an Aviva Accu-Chek
glucose strip system (#07400918016, #06453988016;
Roche Diagnostics International, Basel, Switzerland),
taking �0.6 μL of blood per measurement. Insulin was
measured using an MSD enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay kit (K152BZC; Meso Scale Diagnostics, Rockville,
MD, USA). Free fatty acids were measured using the Wako
Nefa kit #9196 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Tokyo,
Japan), triglycerides (TG) were measured with the Cobas
Roche/Hitachi Kit #11489232 (Roche Diagnostics Inter-
national) and cholesterol was measured using the Cobas
Roche/Hitachi Kit #11877771 (Roche Diagnostics Inter-
national). Total ketone bodies were determined using the
Wako Chemicals Kit #415-73301/411-73401 (Wako Pure
Chemical Industries).
Glucose/insulin tolerance test
Animals were fasted at 08.00 h in the morning and
injected I.P. with 1.5 g kg–1 body weight of glucose [glucose
tolerance test (GTT)] or 0.5 U kg–1 body weight of insulin
[insulin tolerance test (ITT)] in 0.9% saline after a 6 h fast.
Blood samples were obtained from tail tip bleedings for
blood glucose measurements at before injection and at 15,
30, 60, 90 and 120 min after injection.
Indirect calorimetry
Indirect calorimetry was performed with a metabolic
cage system (PhenoMaster; TSE systems, Bad Homburg,
Germany). On the basis of sequential measurement
points (sample interval 20 min) O2 consumption ( ˙
VO2)
and CO2 production ( ˙
VCO2) were calculated using the
manufacturer’ssoftware(TSEPhenoMaster,version5.6.5)
with the coefficients of 3.941 (C ˙
VO2) and 1.106 (C ˙
VCO2)
and normalization to the lean body mass. Respiratory
exchange ratio (RER) was measured as the ratio of CO2
produced over O2 consumed. Mice were acclimated to
the system before measurements. At the beginning of the
experiment, mice were switched to HFD or KD, or left on
chow. Water and food was available ad libitum during the
whole measurement, and food weight was measured daily.
A multidimensional infrared beam system assessed the
locomotor activity which was defined as the total number
ofbeambreaksinthex-andy-axis.Roomtemperaturewas
set to 23°C; the light/dark cycle in the room was 12:12 h
(lights off at 07.00 h). Mice were monitored for a total of
3 days. Lean body mass of each animal was determined
by echo magnetic resonance imaging before and after the
experiment.
Glucose clamp studies
Hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic
clamp
studies
were
performed in freely moving mice as described previously
(Wueest et al. 2010). Mice were anesthetized with iso-
flurane and given analgesia (buprenorphine, 0.1 mg kg–1)
and eye ointment was applied to both eyes (vitamin A;
Bausch & Lomb Swiss AG, Switzerland). A polyurethane
catheter was inserted into the right jugular vein and
exteriorized at the neck. Post-surgery, mice were given
daily analgesia with carprofen (nororcarp, 5 mg kg–1)
for 3 days. Five to 7 days after the surgery, glucose
clamp was performed in mice that had lost less than
10% of their pre-operative weight. Mice were fasted
at 08.00 h in the morning. Basal glucose production
was measured after 4 h 30 min for 80 min. For the
clamp, insulin was infused at a constant rate (18 and
12 mU kg–1 min–1) and steady-state glucose infusion
rate was calculated once glucose infusion reached a more
or less constant rate for 15–20 min with blood glucose
levels at 4–5 mM (and 6–7 mM, respectively). Glucose
concentration was determined using Aviva Accu-Chek
strips every 5 min by sampling blood from a small incision
in the tail tip. The glucose disposal rate was calculated
by dividing the rate of [3-3H] glucose infusion by the
plasma [3-3H] glucose specific activity at steady-state.

Endogenous glucose production during the clamp was
calculated by subtracting the glucose infusion rate from
the glucose disposal rate. To assess tissue-specific glucose
uptake, a bolus (10 μCi) of 2-[1-14C]deoxyglucose was
administered via catheter at the end of the steady-state
period. Blood was sampled 2, 15, 25 and 35 min after bolus
delivery. The area under the curve of disappearing plasma
2-[1-14C] deoxyglucose was used together with tissue
concentration of phosphorylated 2-[1-14C] deoxyglucose
to calculate glucose uptake as described previously (Chin
et al. 2015).
Statistical analysis
All data are reported as the mean ± SEM. Statistical
analysis was performed using Prism (GraphPad Software
Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Correlation was analysed by
calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient. Differences
between groups were analysed by ANOVA with a
Bonferroni post hoc test. P � 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Short-term obesogenic HFD feeding but not KD
causes an increase in fasting insulin and homeostatic
model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)
First, we assessed metabolic parameters in unchallenged
mice after a 6 h fast, comparing mice fed a standard chow
diet with mice fed a 60% HFD, or a low carbohydrate KD
for 3 days. We found that, after 3 days of KD feeding,
plasma glucose was slightly reduced compared to chow
or HFD (Fig. 1A), whereas plasma insulin levels (Fig. 1B)
were not significantly different after a 6 h fast, although
they were elevated in HFD fed mice compared to KD.
The use of these parameters to calculate the HOMA-IR
metric to quantify insulin resistance suggests that KD fed
mice are slightly more insulin sensitive than chow fed mice
after 3 days, whereas HFD fed mice show slightly impaired
insulin signalling according to HOMA-IR compared to
KD mice (Fig. 1C). Because HOMA-IR is based only on
a correlation between fasted glucose and insulin levels,
it does not necessarily reflect actual glucose tolerance.
Because fasting plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels have
been reported to correlate strongly with insulin resistance,
we measured FFA after a 6 h fast. We found a slight but not
significant increase in plasma FFA in the fasted state for
KD vs. chow. Furthermore, we found no difference in TG
(Fig. 1E) or cholesterol (Fig. 1F) between chow and KD fed
animals after a 6 h fast, and only small differences between
HFD and chow fed animals. As expected from the diet,
total plasma ketones were significantly increased in the
animals on KD compared to chow and HFD fed animals
(Fig. 1G). After 3 days of the respective diets, no significant
difference in body weight gain was yet apparent (Fig. 1H),
despite an increased caloric intake on HFD and KD, which
both show an increased caloric density compared to chow
(Fig. 1I). These data indicate that, in the basal state, 3 days
of a KD appears to have a neutral to beneficial effect on
insulin sensitivity, suggesting a healthy, glucose tolerant
state.
Short-term KD or HFD feeding causes impaired
glucose clearance and insulin tolerance
To assess glucose sensitivity, we next challenged animals
with an I.P. GTT after 3 days of a HFD or KD diet
(Fig. 2A and B). Unlike our findings in the basal fasted
state, we found a marked and significant decrease in
glucose clearance of both HFD and KD fed animals
compared to chow fed animals. We also performed an
I.P. ITT after 3 days of diet (Fig. 2C). The response in
the ITT showed a similar impairment as in the GTT
(Fig. 2D). These data suggest that, despite an apparently
improved insulin sensitivity in the fasted state, 3 days of
KD feeding is sufficient to cause impaired glucose homeo-
stasis in C57/Bl6 mice, comparable to the known adverse
short-term effects of a HFD feeding regime.
Steady-state RER inversely correlates with glucose
tolerance, although all groups respond to an I.P.
glucose challenge with an increase in RER
The feeding of a KD for 3 days is metabolically similar
to the interventions leading to the observed effect of
starvation diabetes, and the suggestion has been made
that a decreased ability to oxidize glucose, resulting from
metabolic adaptation to lipids, might be at least partly
responsible for the effect (Anderson & Herman, 1972).
Therefore, we aimed to measure systemic substrate usage
by measuring ˙
VO2 and ˙
VCO2 by indirect calorimetry. We
found no differences between the three groups in ˙
VO2
consumed normalized to lean body mass (Fig. 3A and C),
suggesting that reported differences in energy expenditure
between these different feeding regimens (Jornayvaz et al.
2010; Hatori et al. 2012) only occur after longer peri-
ods of feeding. We did find differences in ˙
VCO2, as might
be expected by shifting substrate usage for oxidative
phosphorylation from carbohydrates to fat (Fig. 3B and
C). These changes in ˙
VCO2 caused marked differences
in the RER. Measuring the RER during the diet switch
showed that, after �16 h, the animals arrived at their
respective steady-state RERs, with the KD fed animals
reaching an RER of �0.7, indicating almost complete
reliance on lipids as a fuel, whereas the HFD fed group
reached an RER of �0.8 and the RER of the chow fed
group remained close to 1.0 (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, these

steady-state RERs correlated very well with the observed
glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in the GTT
and ITT, respectively (Fig. 2). We obtained a Pearson
correlation coefficient of r = –0.9991, R2 = 0.9995 and
P = 0.0146 for RER vs. AUCGTT and a Pearson correlation
coefficient of r = –0.9981, R2 = 0.9961 and P = 0.039 for
RER vs. AUCITT. One possible explanation occasionally
evoked to explain the effects of starvation diabetes is
that the metabolic shift to lipids causes impairments
in the ability to metabolize or take up glucose and
our observation concerning the correlations of RER
with glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity appears to
support such a hypothesis. To test this, we performed a
GTT on animals during continuous indirect calorimetry
measurements. We found that all groups immediately
reacted to the I.P. injection of glucose after a 6 h fast
with a brief but marked increase in RER (Fig. 3D and E).
This suggests that the ability and propensity to metabolize

glucose is unaltered, despite a marked metabolic shift in
the primary oxidation fuel caused by adaptation to the
various diets, and that the observed changes in glucose
homeostasis are not directly a result of the change in the
primary metabolic substrate.
Hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamps reveal
differences in insulin-suppressed endogenous glucose
production but not glucose disposal or tissue glucose
uptake
To
assess
whole
body
and
tissue-specific
insulin
sensitivity
in
mice
fed
the
three
different
diets,
hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamps were performed.
We used [3-3H] labelled glucose to estimate basal and
insulin-suppressed endogenous glucose production (EGP;
mainly reflecting hepatic glucose production) and a bolus
of2-[1-14C]labelleddeoxyglucosewasgivenafterreaching
steady-state glucose infusion to measure tissue-specific
glucose uptake. We infused 18 mU kg–1 min–1 insulin
and clamped the mice at a plasma glucose level of 5 mM
(Fig. 4A). The glucose infusion rate necessary to achieve
euglycemia (Fig. 4B) was significantly lower in mice after
3 days of KD feeding compared to chow fed mice, whereas
values for the HFD-fed mice were between those for KD
and chow (Fig. 4C and D). This situation is somewhat
similar to that observed during the IPGTT (Fig. 2A),
where the temporal dynamics showed a slightly better
glucose clearance of HFD animals compared to KD,
whereas both groups were clearly impaired in glucose
tolerance compared to chow. Although basal EGP was
similar between the groups, the ability of insulin to
supress EGP was significantly reduced in KD compared
to chow-fed mice (Fig. 4E). Conversely, neither the rates
of systemic glucose disappearance (Fig. 4F), nor glucose
uptake into white adipose tissue (WAT) and muscle
(Fig. 4G) were changed. These data indicate that reduced
insulin sensitivity observed in KD fed mice is mainly
mediated by blunted hepatic insulin sensitivity.
Hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamps with lower
insulin and glucose targets confirm effect of reduced
insulin-suppressed endogenous glucose production
To further confirm these findings, we repeated the
hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamp studies with lower
infusion rates of insulin (12 mU kg–1 min–1) and higher
plasma glucose targets (6–7 mM), using [3-3H] labelled
glucose to estimate basal and insulin-suppressed end-
ogenous glucose production and a bolus of 2-[1-14C] at
steady-state to measure tissue glucose uptake (Fig. 5A). In
this setting, HFD and KD fed animals needed significantly
lower rates of glucose infusion to achieve plasma levels in
the target range (Fig. 5B–D). Again, we did not observe a
difference in basal EGP, although there was a significantly
increased EGP of KD animals in the insulin suppressed
state (Fig. 5E). Similar to the clamps with higher insulin

infusion and lower glucose targets, there was no significant
difference in the systemic rate of glucose disappearance
(Fig. 5F) or WAT and muscle glucose uptake (Fig. 5E).
These data confirm our finding that the reduced insulin
sensitivity observed in KD fed mice is mainly mediated
by blunted hepatic insulin sensitivity affecting glucose
output, across different ranges of insulin infusion and
target plasma glucose levels.
Discussion
Given the controversy regarding the link between KD
and insulin sensitivity, we analysed glucose tolerance in
response to short-term dietary challenges of KD and
HFD vs. a chow diet. The results of the present study
demonstrate that, in the context of ad libitum feeding of
both HFD or KD for a short period, the effect on systemic

glucose tolerance is a result of the inability of insulin
to suppress hepatic glucose output, whereas muscle and
adipose tissue glucose uptake are completely unperturbed.
In our initial hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamp
study, we chose rather high insulin levels during the
clamp (18 mU kg–1 min–1), leading to a complete
suppression of hepatic glucose output under insulin and
even negative values for EGP in some cases. We aimed
to address this by repeating the clamp studies with
lower insulin levels (12 mU kg–1 min–1) and higher
glucose targets. Although we were able to confirm our
initial findings, it should be noted that our insulin levels
still are high and lead to almost complete suppression
of HGP.
In longer-term studies, 5 weeks of KD feeding resulted
in a similar phenotype to the one observed by us after
3 days (Jornayvaz et al. 2010), whereas other studies
report universally beneficial effects on glucose metabolism

resulting from KD feeding (Kennedy et al. 2007; Badman

rodents for a time span of years complicate the picture.
Roberts et al. (2017) report drastically impaired systemic

present study and those of Jornayvaz et al. (2010), yet
improved insulin sensitivity in aged mice on a live-long

functional data on glucose homeostasis. Our own studies
and those of Jornayvaz et al. (2010) were performed in
young mice, and so a plausible interpretation of these data
is that impaired glucose tolerance is a direct metabolic
effect of KD feeding, whereas life-long low levels of glucose
and insulin might counter the age-dependent insulin

resistance, which appears to involve a different mechanism
than diet-induced insulin resistance (Bapat et al. 2015).
Persistent low glucose and insulin plasma levels leading
to a shift of lipid oxidation as the main fuel, as well as
ketogenesis to preserve glucose, are key features that are
shared by KD feeding and starvation. This is pertinent
in light of the literature on starvation diabetes (Peters,
1945; Lundbaek, 1948), which suggests that 1–3 days
of starvation or carbohydrate depletion is sufficient to
impair systemic glucose clearance. It is possible that 3 days
of carbohydrate depletion is sufficient to achieve the
metabolic adaptation to KD and that the effects observed
after longer duration reported by Jornayvaz et al. (2010)
are not a result of impairments caused by long-term KD
but, instead, reflect the normal physiological adaptation
to low carbohydrate intake. In the context of obesogenic
HFD (typically containing �60% of calories from fat and
20% from carbohydrates), the impaired ability of insulin
to reduce EGP after a few days of HFD feeding has been
repeatedly observed in mice and men (Song et al. 2001;
Brøns et al. 2009; Wiedemann et al. 2013). Moreover,
elevated EGP is also known to be a key contributor of
the elevated glucose levels occurring in T2D (Hundal et al.
2000). Our finding that, in both short-term KD and HFD
feeding, tissue glucose uptake is normal, is also in line
with a recent report analysing the effect of obesogenic 60%
HFD-feeding for different time-spans (Turner et al. 2013),
whichdemonstratedthatthreedaysofHFDfeedingcaused
insulin resistance specifically at the level of the liver. By
contrast, impairments of muscle glucose uptake were only
observed after 3 weeks and longer of HFD feeding. On the
otherhand,ithaslongbeenreportedthatlowinsulinlevels

diabetes. However, this insulin resistance affects primarily
the muscle (and not the liver), suggesting that this effect
is unrelated to the causes of insulin resistance stemming
from short-term high-fat diet consumption (DeFronzo
et al. 1982a, b).
It is clear that, although there are important metabolic
similarities between KD feeding and starvation, there are
also substantial differences. Both starvation and dietary
carbohydrate depletion lead to a switch of primary
fuel from carbohydrate to lipid, as well as ketogenesis.
However, starvation causes a pronounced reduction in
energyexpenditureandheatproduction(Cahilletal.1966;
Cahill, 1970; Jensen et al. 2013), whereas KD provides
ample energy and reportedly causes either increased or
unchanged energy expenditure (Jornayvaz et al. 2010;
Paoli et al. 2013; Hall et al. 2016). The consequences of
starvation resulting from reduced energy intake, rather
than reduced carbohydrate intake, include increased auto-
phagy and a reduced metabolic rate. Thus, it is possible
thatthesymptomsofshort-termKDfeedinginthepresent
study, and the reported symptoms of starvation diabetes
are caused by different mechanisms.
ThesignificantcorrelationofRERandimpairedglucose
homeostasis suggests otherwise. In terms of the primary
fuel for oxidation, our data show that animals on
a regular chow diet primarily oxidize carbohydrates,
whereas animals on a KD oxidize almost exclusively lipids
and their RER does not move at all during fasting,
with the HFD fed animals lying in between, oxidizing
somewhat more lipids than carbohydrates. Remarkably,
this fuel preference predicts the impairment to glucose
homeostasis assessed by all three methods (GTT, ITT and
glucose clamp). The severity of the impairment correlates
linearly with the degree of lipid oxidation, with KD
fed animals being most impaired and HFD fed animals
lying in between. Importantly, the RER measurements
during GTT and the glucose clamp studies reveal that
the impairment does not occur at the level of the rate
of glucose disappearance from plasma, tissue glucose
uptake or the ability to oxidize glucose. In the fasted or
carbohydrate-depleted state, which is typically when rates
of FFA oxidation are high in healthy individuals, increased
hepatic glucose output is a vital necessity. Because the
depletion of liver and muscle glycogen stores requires
replenishment, it is plausible to propose that substantially
elevated rates of FFA oxidation persisting for durations
longer than 18–24 h is interpreted by part of the physio-
logical homeostat as a signal for glucose depletion. This
signal might result in a deliberate modulation of the ability
of insulin to block endogenous glucose output to replenish
muscle glycogen stores after periods of glucose paucity.
Such a signal probably acts via the CNS, as reported pre-
viously (Girard, 2006), and is entirely consistent with the
observed phenotype of starvation diabetes, which should
more accurately be termed glucose depletion-dependent
impaired glucose tolerance.
Although animals on a HFD for 3 days are by no means
diabetic, long-term HFD feeding is the quintessential
animal model for diet-induced insulin resistance leading
to T2D, and it is clear that, also in humans, the
impact of an obesogenic diet occurs very long before
overt T2D (Nathan, 2002; Boden et al. 2015). However,
these initial causes and triggers are still incompletely
understood. In terms of the long-term progression
of the disease, inflammation has been prominently
invoked in the discussion of insulin resistance in the
context of T2D. Dating back to a seminal study by
Hotamisligil et al. (1993), a large body of evidence
has convincingly demonstrated a causal link between
inflammatory processes and peripheral insulin resistance,
in particular in muscle and adipose tissue (Gregor &
Hotamisligil, 2011). The current frontrunner for the first
injury following a switch to obesogenic HFD is acute
activation and inflammation of astrocytes and microglia,
particularly in the ventromedial hypothalamus (Horvath
et al. 2010; Thaler et al. 2011). However, a recent
study in which inflammatory activation of microglia

was blocked in the CNS demonstrated alterations in
energy expenditure and intake, although no changes in
glucose homeostasis were observed (Valdearcos et al.
2017). Moreover, a recent study analysing injury in the
CNS resulting from the consumption of high-fat, low
carbohydrate or high-fat, high carbohydrate diets only
found damage following the high-fat, high carbohydrate
diets(Gaoetal.2017).Furthermore,astudyexaminingthe
effects of inflammation on HFD induced insulin resistance
over time reported a biphasic effect; short-term effects
were independent of inflammation, whereas long-term
effects responded well to various anti-inflammatory inter-
ventions (Lee et al. 2011). These data lend credence to the
interpretation that the early increase in hepatic glucose
production following a HFD challenge is not caused by
injury but, instead, represents a physiological response to
drastically elevated fat intake and a shift in metabolic fuel
preference.
Interestingly, in our studies, only the HFD animals
showed signs of impaired glucose homeostasis when
observed in the 6 h fasted state, even though the effect on
hepatic glucose output under insulin was stronger in the
KD fed group. The key difference between these two diets
is that the obesogenic HFD provides significant amounts
of calories from both fat and carbohydrate, whereas the
non-obesogenic KD provides calories almost exclusively
from fat. It is relevant to note that a low carbohydrate
KD does not cause obesity and that muscle insulin
sensitivity appears to be entirely preserved in this model
even after long periods of feeding, in marked contrast
to obesogenic HFD (Jornayvaz et al. 2010; Garbow et al.
2011). These observations are readily explained assuming
that persistently elevated lipid oxidation causes a signal
to be transmitted to indicate glucose paucity and that
the fat oxidation-dependent blunting of the ability of
insulin to suppress EGP is probably not linked to any
damage and is reversible. This is a necessary adaptation
in animals on a KD. However, in animals consuming
large amounts of fat together with significant amounts of
carbohydrate (a hallmark of the so-called Western diet),
the increased flux of glucose from endogenous production
combines with the dietary glucose, leading to a progressive
deterioration of systemic insulin sensitivity caused by the
elevated insulin levels released from the pancreas to cope
with elevated postprandial and fasting glucose levels.
