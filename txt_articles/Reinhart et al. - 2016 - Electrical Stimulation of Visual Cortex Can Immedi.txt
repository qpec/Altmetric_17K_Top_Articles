In Brief
Reinhart et al. show that 20 min of direct-
current stimulation can change visual
acuity. Subjects’ event-related potentials
showed the same pattern of amplitude
changes observed with behavior. Finally,
subjects with the worst visual acuity
showed the largest improvements
following anodal stimulation of visual
cortex.

SUMMARY
We can improve human vision by correcting the op-
tics of our lenses [1–3]. However, after the eye trans-
duces the light, visual cortex has its own limitations
that are challenging to correct [4]. Overcoming these
limitations has typically involved innovative training
regimes that improve vision across many days [5,
6]. In the present study, we wanted to determine
whether it is possible to immediately improve the
precision of spatial vision with noninvasive direct-
current stimulation. Previous work suggested that
visual processing could be modulated with such
stimulation [7–9]. However, the short duration and
variability of such effects made it seem unlikely that
spatial vision could be improved for more than
several minutes [7, 10]. Here we show that visual
acuity in the parafoveal belt can be immediately
improved by delivering noninvasive direct current
to visual cortex. Twenty minutes of anodal stimula-
tion improved subjects’ vernier acuity by approxi-
mately 15% and increased the amplitude of the
earliest visually evoked potentials in lockstep with
the behavioral effects. When we reversed the orien-
tation of the electric field, we impaired resolution
and reduced the amplitude of visually evoked poten-
tials.
Next,
we
found
that
anodal
stimulation
improved acuity enough to be measurable with the
relatively coarse Snellen test and that subjects with
the poorest acuity benefited the most from stimula-
tion. Finally, we found that stimulation-induced acu-
ity improvements were accompanied by changes in
contrast sensitivity at high spatial frequencies.
RESULTS
In experiment 1, we stimulated posterior visual cortex (i.e., occi-
pitoparietal cortex) with transcranial direct-current stimulation
(tDCS). We parametrically manipulated stimulation intensity to
determine what dose might improve visual-spatial precision. All
20 subjects completed three anodal stimulation conditions at
varying stimulation intensities (1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mA) on different
days, with the order randomized across subjects. We stimulated
either the left or right hemisphere (see Figure 1A; hemisphere
counterbalanced), with stimuli presented in the stimulated visual
field (i.e., contralateral [contra]) or the unstimulated visual field
(i.e., ipsilateral [ipsi]), similar to approaches in neuropsychology
[11]. We used 20 min of anodal tDCS in each condition because
this duration and current-flow direction have been shown to in-
crease neuronal excitability [7, 12–15]. Subjects were blind to
the stimulation conditions, as verified with debriefing question-
naires (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
Immediately following stimulation, subjects performed a later-
alized version of the vernier acuity task (Figure 1B). Subjects
judged the relative position of two abutting vertical lines and indi-
cated whether the upper line was displaced to the left or right of
the lower line, displaced by 2.2, 4.4, or 6.6 arc min randomized
across trials, with the lines centered 5� to the left or right of
fixation [16–18] (i.e., in the parafoveal belt; see the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures for details). This combination of
eccentricity and displacement was sufficient to bring subjects’
performance below ceiling and reveal stimulation benefits if
they existed.
Experiment 1 showed that 20 min of anodal stimulation at
2.0 mA improved vernier acuity relative to performance following
1.0 and 1.5 mA of stimulation. Figures 1C and 1D show that we
found significant main effects of intensity on reaction time (RT)
(p = 0.01) and accuracy (p = 0.04) across task difficulty levels
(2.2–6.6 arc min) (see Table S1 for statistical details). These
main effects were due to 2.0 mA resulting in faster RTs and
higher accuracy than 1.0 mA (RT, p = 0.01; accuracy, p = 0.04)
and 1.5 mA of tDCS (RT, p = 0.02; accuracy, p = 0.03). However,
this was only true for stimuli presented contralateral to the stim-
ulating electrode. For ipsilateral stimuli, the stimulation intensity
had no significant behavioral effects (RT, p = 0.64; accuracy,
p = 0.91). These lateralized improvements did not differ between
subjects who received left- versus right-hemisphere tDCS
(no stimulation location 3 intensity interactions on RT, contra,
p = 0.93; ipsi, p = 0.25; or accuracy, contra, p = 0.79; ipsi,
p = 0.95). These findings show that increasing the excitability
of visual cortex with anodal direct current can improve behav-
ioral measures of vernier acuity in the parafovea.
By recording the subjects’ event-related potentials (ERPs), we
verified that stimulation was changing how the brain processed
the visual information at the earliest measurable points in pro-
cessing. Figures 1E–1G show that the stimulation enhanced
the early visual waveforms related to sensory processing (i.e.,
the visual first positive component [P1] and first negative compo-
nent [N1]) [19]. The P1 and N1 amplitudes elicited by stimuli

 contralateral to the stimulation increased with intensity (main ef-
fect of intensity on P1, p = 0.05; N1, p = 0.01), with the strongest
enhancements following 2.0 mA relative to 1.0 mA intensity (P1,
p = 0.04; N1, p = 0.01). No stimulation-induced changes to P1
and N1 amplitudes were observed for ipsilaterally presented
stimuli (P1, p = 0.61; N1, p = 0.90) or between lower stimulation
intensities (1.0 mA versus 1.5 mA, P1 contra, p = 0.22; P1 ipsi,
p = 0.50; N1 contra, p = 0.76; N1 ipsi, p = 0.91). Thus, the
subjects’ visual P1 and N1 components exhibited amplitude
changes that mirrored the behavioral effects, demonstrating
that tDCS changed the earliest stages of processing in the visual
system.
Our results from experiment 1 show that the benefits of anodal
stimulation over visual cortex were only evident when we used
2.0 mA of tDCS for 20 min, not the lower levels of intensity. In
our subsequent experiments, we focused on this level of current
in our active stimulation conditions.
Next, we reversed the direction of current flow in experiment 2
(Figure 2A). All subjects completed a sham baseline condition
and an active 2.0 mA cathodal stimulation condition on different
days, with the order counterbalanced across subjects. Cathodal
stimulation has been shown to decrease the excitability of cortex
in humans and animal models [12, 20]. Thus, 20 min of cathodal
stimulation should decrease vernier acuity and reduce the ampli-
tude of the visual ERPs relative to the sham baseline.
Experiment 2 demonstrated that we could push behavior and
the subjects’ visual ERPs in the opposite direction with cathodal
tDCS. Figures 2B and 2C show that relative to the sham baseline
condition, 20 min of 2.0 mA cathodal tDCS significantly slowed
RTs (p = 0.03) and reduced accuracy (p = 0.04) across displace-
ments (i.e., 2.2–6.6 arc min) (see Table S1 for statistical details).
These behavioral changes in vernier acuity were specific to the
visual field contralateral to the tDCS. No such changes in task
performance were observed for ipsilaterally presented stimuli
(RT, p = 0.95; accuracy, p = 0.48).
Figures 2D and 2E show that cathodal stimulation reduced
the amplitude of the visual N1 component relative to sham, but
this time largely spared the amplitude of the preceding P1
component. Paralleling the behavior, we found a spatially map-
ped pattern of ERP results. Only N1 amplitudes elicited by
stimuli appearing contralateral to the tDCS were significantly
reduced (contra, p = 0.03; ipsi, p = 0.87). No effects were seen
in the P1 amplitude following stimulation (contra, p = 0.23; ipsi,
p = 0.89). The findings of experiment 2 demonstrate that by

 reversing the current flow, we can flip the behavioral and electro-
physiological effects that we observed in experiment 1.
If the results from experiments 1 and 2 are not unique to tDCS
applied to visual cortex but can be produced using any lateral-
ized tDCS montage due to nonspecific effects such as arousal
or demand characteristics, then we should find a similar pattern
of results when stimulating over a different brain region. In exper-
iment 3, we applied 20 min of sham and 2.0 mA anodal tDCS over
the left or right hemisphere of motor cortex (see Figure 3A), with
the hemisphere counterbalanced across 20 subjects, prior to
having the subjects complete the vernier acuity task. These sub-
jects showed a completely different pattern of behavioral effects
compared to tDCS of visual cortex. Figures 3B and 3C show that
subjects simply responded faster and less accurately regardless
of the location of stimuli in the visual field (see the Supplemental
Results and Discussion for details). Whereas the results of ex-
periments 1 and 2 rule out attentional, eye movement, and pupil
dilation accounts of the tDCS effects (see the Supplemental Re-
sults and Discussion for details), the results of experiment 3
show that only tDCS of visual cortex improves performance in
the vernier task.
If the anodal stimulation of experiment 1 is truly improving sub-
jects’ visual-spatial resolution, then we should improve real-
world acuity outside the laboratory. In experiment 4, we exam-
ined the impact of 20 min of 2.0 mA anodal tDCS of visual cortex
on the performance of the Snellen chart for visual acuity, a com-
mon exam in clinical practice. All 20 subjects completed the
Snellen test before and after a sham tDCS testing day and before
and after an anodal tDCS testing day. The order of stimulation
and the hemisphere stimulated (left or right) were counterbal-
anced across subjects.
Figure 4 shows that subjects scored higher on the Snellen test
of central visual acuity after the lateral application of anodal tDCS
compared with before anodal tDCS (pre versus post percent
change, mean ± SEM, 21.8% ± 9.2%; main effect of time on
the logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution [logMAR] score,
p = 0.003). Our sham condition allowed us to control for practice
effects. We found that despite mild trend-level practice effects in
the sham condition (mean ± SEM, 7.2% ± 5.7%; main effect of
time on logMAR score, p = 0.06), the anodal tDCS induced signif-
icantly greater behavioral gains relative to the sham condition,
evidenced by a stimulation 3 time interaction on logMAR score
(p = 0.04). Accounting for practice effects, the stimulation
boosted subjects’ logMAR score by approximately 14.6%. An
individual-subject analysis showed that all but two subjects
had 20/20 vision (i.e., logMAR = 0) or better in both eyes, consis-
tent with previous work with young adults [21] (see the Supple-
mental Information for results with these two subjects excluded).
Despite the excellent vision of our subjects, the majority of sub-
jects improved with tDCS (14 out of 20), correctly reading an
additional 1.2 letters on average (accounting for practice effects)
after the anodal stimulation. Individuals with the poorest eyesight
experienced the largest stimulation-induced gains, evidenced
by a significant subject-wise correlation (p = 0.005). If our find-
ings generalize to individuals with clinical-grade vision deficits,
the findings of experiment 4 suggest that those with the largest
deficits may show the largest benefit of anodal tDCS. However,
the true therapeutic utility of this tDCS protocol will require clin-
ical research with patient populations.
Finally, in experiment 5, we tested whether the improvements
in acuity following tDCS co-occurred with improvements in
contrast sensitivity, given the close link between these visual
functions [22–24]. Experiment 5 was identical to experiment
4, except that we used a two-interval forced choice task with
a Bayesian adaptive procedure to estimate subjects’ con-
trast sensitivity function across a range of spatial frequencies
(0.5–20 cycles per degree [cpd]) (see the Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures for details). We found that anodal stimulation
had an effect on mean contrast sensitivity, but only for contralat-
erally presented grating stimuli at high spatial frequencies (see
Figure S1 and Table S1). This was demonstrated by an interac-
tion between time and stimulation for contralateral (p = 0.001)
but not ipsilateral stimuli (p = 0.65). Parsing this interaction re-
vealed an improvement across time (pre versus post) in the
anodal condition (p = 0.001) but not the sham (p = 0.56). Further,
within the anodal condition, we observed a time 3 frequency
interaction (p = 0.01), driven by changes at spatial frequencies

 greater than 7 cpd (p’s < 0.03). These results converge with
those from experiment 1 by showing that occipitoparietal tDCS
can have a hemifield-selective influence on the high spatial fre-
quency contrast sensitivity thresholds in the parafovea. These
results add to previous work [10, 25] and confirm overlapping
function between contrast sensitivity and visual acuity [22–24].
DISCUSSION
Our demonstration that anodal tDCS of occipitoparietal visual
cortex improves spatial vision may seem counterintuitive,
because this type of stimulation does not target the specific neu-
rons that code for the line segments in the vernier acuity task or
the letters on the Snellen chart. One might expect tDCS to in-
crease both the noise and the signal to the same degree, given
that anodal stimulation increases baseline firing rates in the
absence of stimuli [20]. However, the present effects of tDCS
could be accounted for in at least two ways. First, tDCS may
have increased the gain for stimuli presented contralateral to
the stimulation, consistent with our observation that the vernier
stimuli elicited more vigorous electrophysiological responses
following anodal stimulation and attenuated responses following
cathodal stimulation. Second, the broad stimulating effects of
anodal tDCS may have increased stochastic resonance. By
increasing the baseline level of activity in the visual system under
the anodal electrode, the signal-to-noise ratio may have been
effectively increased because the addition of higher-amplitude
white noise to this nonlinear neural system can improve process-
ing [26]. In contrast, cathodal stimulation reduces activity levels,
and the intrinsic stochastic resonance in the system, reducing
the signal-to-noise ratio. Stochastic resonance has been shown
to make a variety of neural systems more sensitive signal proces-
sors, and our anodal tDCS protocol may induce just such bene-
ficial noise. We believe that these competing explanations can
be distinguished by experiments that combine direct-current
stimulation with recordings from neurons in animal models.
Here we found tDCS effects on spatial vision that last for over
an hour, with large, immediate improvements in acuity (see Fig-
ure S2). How do we reconcile our results with previous work that
found small effects of tDCS on the visual system that disap-
peared within 10 min of the end of stimulation [10, 27]? We see
the electrode montage as the largest difference between the pre-
sent and previous work. We stimulated occipitoparietal cortex
using a distant cheek location for the other electrode. Previous
work placed one electrode over the occipital pole or over the fifth
visual area (V5) and the other at the top of the head (central zenith
electrode in the 10/20 system [Cz]), resulting in modest effects
that lasted only a few minutes after stimulation ceased, possibly
due to opposing effects induced by the electrode at Cz [20].
Because the cathodal and anodal electrodes push and pull activ-
ity levels in opposite directions, we will need experiments to
verify that the electrode placements in previous work result in
the short and counterintuitive effects compared to the effects
observed here.
To increase the applicability of the occipitoparietal tDCS pro-
tocol as a potential therapeutic treatment, it will be necessary for
future work to more extensively explore the tDCS parameter
space. Lengthening stimulation duration, increasing the focality
of current flow, and conducting repeated stimulation sessions
with optimal spacing intervals [28] are methods that may
generate longer-lasting improvements in spatial vision. Finally,
our psychophysical manipulations tested vernier acuity at loca-
tions in the parafoveal belt using a brief stimulus presentation.
It will be useful for future work to determine whether occipitopar-
ietal stimulation influences processing in the fovea (<0.06�) and
periphery (>5�) with prolonged viewing durations while tracking
eye movements. Forthcoming work that addresses the above
questions will significantly improve our understanding of our oc-
cipitoparietal tDCS method and determine its value for applica-
tions outside the laboratory.
