Background
Analgesic medication is the most frequently prescribed treatment for low back pain (LBP), of which paracetamol (acetaminophen) is
recommended as the first choice medication. However, there is uncertainty about the efficacy of paracetamol for LBP
.
Objectives
To investigate the efficacy and safety of paracetamol for non-specific LBP
.
Search methods
We conducted searches on the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, which includes the Back and Neck Review
Group trials register), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, Web of Science, LILACS, and IPA from their inception to 7 August
2015. We also searched the reference lists of eligible papers and trial registry websites (WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov).
Selection criteria
We only considered randomised trials comparing the efficacy of paracetamol with placebo for non-specific LBP
. The primary outcomes
were pain and disability. We also investigated quality of life, function, adverse effects, global impression of recovery, sleep quality, patient
adherence, and use of rescue medication as secondary outcomes.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed the data extraction and assessed risk of bias in the included studies. We also evaluated
the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. We converted scales for pain intensity to a common 0 to 100 scale. We quantified
treatment effects using mean difference for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes. We used effect sizes and
95% confidence intervals as a measure of treatment effect for the primary outcomes. When the treatment effects were smaller than 9
points on a 0 to 100 scale, we considered the effect as small and not clinically important.

 Main results
Our searches retrieved 4449 records, of which two trials were included in the review (n=1785). For acute LBP
, there is high-quality
evidence for no difference between paracetamol (4 g per day) and placebo at 1 week (immediate term), 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks
(short term) for the primary outcomes. There is high-quality evidence that paracetamol has no effect on quality of life, function, global
impression of recovery, and sleep quality for all included time periods. There were also no significant differences between paracetamol
and placebo for adverse events, patient adherence, or use of rescue medication. No trials were identified evaluating patients with subacute
or chronic LBP
.
Authors’ conclusions
We found that paracetamol does not produce better outcomes than placebo for people with acute LBP
.

Paracetamol for low back pain
Review question
To see how well paracetamol works for non-specific low back pain (LBP). Non-specific LBP is back pain for which there is no identified
disease or condition.
Background
Paracetamol is one of the most commonly prescribed medicines for people with LBP
, and it is recommended in the guidelines that are
issued to help doctors manage different illnesses. However, recent evidence has called into question how effective it is.
Search date
The evidence is current to August 2015.
Study characteristics
We included two trials with a total of 1785 participants in this review with participants whose back pain occurred suddenly and recently
(acute). Most of the people in the study (90%) were middle-aged and came from a single trial that looked at acute back pain. Both
trials tested paracetamol against a placebo (which contains nothing that could act as a medicine). Participants were followed between
one day and 12 weeks. The main outcomes we studied were pain and disability; we also looked at quality of life, how easily people
could go about their daily lives, unpleasant or unwanted side effects, how well people felt they had recovered, sleep quality, whether
participants had taken the medicine as prescribed, and if it had been necessary to take ‘rescue medication’ because the paracetamol had
not worked. We combined the findings from one trial (n=1651) into a single analysis (meta-analysis) that compared paracetamol to a
placebo; the second trial did not report the results for the placebo, and so it could not be included.
Key results and quality of evidence
We found high-quality evidence that paracetamol (4 g per day) is no better than placebo for relieving acute LBP in either the short
or longer term. It also worked no better than placebo on the other aspects studied, such as quality of life and sleep quality. About one
in five people reported side effects, though few were serious, and there was no difference between intervention and control groups. As
most of the participants studied were middle-aged, we cannot be sure that the findings would be the same for other age groups.

Paracetamol for low back pain (Review)
Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 B A C K G R O U N D
Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability world-
wide (Global Burden of Disease Study 2015). Patients usually ex-
perience a substantial reduction in pain intensity in the first six
weeks following the onset of a new episode, however in many
patients the pain does not resolve completely (Menezes 2012;
Pengel 2003). About 40% of patients will develop chronic LBP
,
persisting for months or years (Menezes 2009). Even for those
patients who recover quickly from the initial acute episode, a re-
current episode during the following 12 months is very common
(Henschke 2008).
The most frequently prescribed treatment for back pain is an anal-
gesic medication; according to clinical practice guidelines, parac-
etamol should be the first-choice pain medicine for people with
non-specific LBP
, especially in the acute phase (Koes 2010). How-
ever, the guideline recommendations for prescribing paracetamol
are based on indirect evidence of efficacy from studies outside the
LBPfield,consensusamongthe guideline developmentgroup, and
greater safety compared to alternative pain medicines (for example
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or opioids) (van
Tulder 2006). The uncertainty about the efficacy of paracetamol as
an analgesic for LBP was highlighted in the first systematic review
of paracetamol for LBP
, which noted the absence of robust data
on treatment efficacy (Davies 2008). Subsequent to the Davies
2008 review, the PACE trial has called into question the efficacy
of paracetamol for people with acute LBP (Williams 2014).
The PACE trial enrolled 1652 participants and reported no sig-
nificant difference in days to recovery between participants taking
paracetamol in a time-contingent fashion, taking paracetamol as
required, or placebo for acute LBP (Williams 2014). There was
also no effect for any of the secondary outcomes (for example pain
intensity, disability, function, global rating of symptom change,
sleep quality, and quality of life). The presumed efficacy of parac-
etamol for LBP as reflected in guideline endorsement is thus con-
troversial, andaCochrane reviewof placebo-controlledtrialscould
provide the credible evidence needed to inform decision-making
based on the highest standard of evidence.
This review is an update of a recent systematic review on parac-
etamol for spinal pain or osteoarthritis (Machado 2015). The
Machado 2015 review has been split into two Cochrane reviews,
one focusing on knee or hip osteoarthritis, and this one, which fo-
cuses on non-specific LBP
. Both reviews follow the same method-
ology according to the guidelines of The Cochrane Collaboration,
Higgins 2011, and the Cochrane Back and Neck Review Group,
Furlan 2015.
Description of the condition
LBP can be defined as pain or discomfort below the ribs and above
the gluteal crease, with or without referred leg pain (Airaksinen
2006). The great majority of people with LBP are classified as hav-
ing non-specific LBP
, which is defined as LBP without any known
specific cause or pathology, such as nerve root compromise or se-
rious spinal pathology (for example fracture, cancer, infection, or
inflammatory diseases). This condition is also staged according to
the duration of symptoms: acute LBP is an episode persisting for
less than six weeks; subacute LBP with symptoms persisting be-
tween six and 12 weeks; and chronic LBP when symptoms persists
for 12 weeks or longer (Furlan 2015).
Description of the intervention
Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is one of the most widely used non-
prescription medicines in the world. It has been commercially
available for over 60 years, making it one of the oldest analgesics
on the market (Jozwiak-Bebenista 2014). The usual adult recom-
mended dose is 325 mg to 1000 mg every four or six hours, not
exceeding 1000 mg per dose or 4000 mg per day (Amar 2007). It
can be prescribed alone or in combination with other medicines,
such as an NSAID or opioid. Paracetamol has been promoted as
the preferred medication for people with LBP due to its low risk of
side effects and similar action to other analgesics (that is, NSAIDs)
(Graham 2013; Koes 2010).
How the intervention might work
Although paracetamol has been widely used in medical practice,
its mechanism of action remains uncertain (Graham 2013). The
main proposed mechanism is the inhibition of cyclooxygenase
(COX) enzymes through metabolism by the peroxidase function
of these isoenzymes. This process results in inhibition of phenoxyl
radical formation from a critical tyrosine residue important for the
cyclooxygenase activity of COX-1 and COX-2 and prostaglandin
synthesis (Graham 2013; Jozwiak-Bebenista 2014). Paracetamol
is a preferential inhibitor of COX-2 due to its gastrointestinal
tolerance and poor inhibition of platelet activity (Graham 2013;
Hinz 2008; Hinz 2012). In addition, recent evidence suggests that
the analgesic action of paracetamol is mediated by inhibition of
COX-3 (Botting 2005).
Paracetamol is widely considered to be a safe drug when admin-
istered in appropriate doses (Jozwiak-Bebenista 2014); however,
there is clear evidence that higher doses or prolonged use of parac-
etamol can lead to liver failure (where the paracetamol compounds
are metabolised), cardiovascular events and even death (Graham
2013; Chan 2006; Forman 2005; Roberts 2015; Daly2008; Sheen
2002).
Why it is important to do this review
This review is an update of a recent systematic review on parac-
etamol for spinal pain and osteoarthritis (Machado 2015), which

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We only considered placebo-controlled randomised trials. We did
not include trials with quasi-random allocation procedures in or-
der to avoid biased estimates of treatment effects across the in-
cluded studies (Furlan 2015; Higgins 2011).
Types of participants
Inclusion criteria:
• People with non-specific acute, subacute, or chronic non-
specific LBP
• People recruited from primary, secondary, or tertiary care
Exclusion criteria:
• People with serious spinal pathology (e.g. cancer, fractures,
cauda equina syndrome, and inflammatory diseases)
• Pregnancy
Types of interventions
We included any dosing regimen of paracetamol compared to
placebo. We did not include any combination of medicines with
paracetamol. We also excluded the use of paracetamol for post-
operative analgesia.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
• Pain intensity
• Disability
Secondary outcomes
• Quality of life
• Function
• Adverse effects
• Global impression of recovery
• Sleep quality
• Patient adherence
• Use of rescue medication

Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies

Paracetamol for low back pain (Review)
Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts, and
full-text papers for potentially eligible studies, resolving any dis-
agreements through discussion or arbitration of a third review au-
thor if consensus could not be reached.
Data extraction and management
Two review authors independently extracted the following data
from each included trial using a standardised data extraction form.
Disagreements were resolved through discussion or arbitration of
a third review author when consensus could not be reached.
• Bibliometric data (authors, year of publication, language).
• Study characteristics (study design, sample size, description
of the sample, country, funding).
• Characteristics of the participants (gender, age, duration of
symptoms).
• Duration of follow-up assessments.
• Means, standard deviations, and sample sizes for
continuous outcome measures. The treatment estimates were
extracted in the following hierarchical order: between-group
differences, within-group change scores, and follow-up values.
• Number of cases and the total sample size for dichotomous
outcomes. For adverse events, we considered the number of
participants reporting any adverse event, the number of
participants reporting any serious adverse event (as defined by
each study), the number of participants withdrawn from study
due to adverse events, and the number of participants with
abnormal results on liver function tests (hepatic enzyme activity
≥ 1.5 times the upper limit of the reference range).
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias of the in-
cluded studies. Disagreements were resolved through discussion
or arbitration of a third review author when consensus could
not be reached. We assessed risk of bias using the ’Risk of bias’
assessment tool recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration
(Higgins 2011) (Appendix 10). We scored each item as ‘high’,
‘low’, or ‘unclear’ risk of bias.
Measures of treatment effect
When more than one scale for measuring pain intensity or dis-
ability was used, we extracted the more severe estimate reported
at baseline. We converted scales for pain intensity to a common 0
(no pain) to 100 (worse pain) scale. We quantified the treatment
effects with the mean difference for continuous outcomes, and
calculated the risk ratios for the positive outcome for dichotomous
outcomes. We used effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals as a
measure of treatment effect. In the previous version of this review
(Machado 2015), we considered the minimal clinically important
difference (MCID) as 9 points on a 0 to 100 scale based upon
the practice in the osteoarthritis field (Wandel 2010), though we
understand that in the back pain field the MCID is usually con-
sidered to be larger than this value (Ostelo 2008). When the treat-
ment effects were smaller than 9 points, we considered the effect
as small and not clinically important.
Unit of analysis issues
To deal with repeated observations on participants, we followed
the advocated strategy of defining the outcomes as well as the
time points a priori (Higgins 2011). We have previously defined
the time points as: immediate term (≤ 2 weeks), short term (> 2
weeks but ≤ 3 months), intermediate term (> 3 months but ≤ 12
months), and long term (> 12 months). However, to account for
studies that reported multiple time points within each category,
we included all time points reported in the included trials.
Dealing with missing data
We contacted authors to provide further information when the
data reported in the paper was insufficient. When authors were
unavailable, we estimated data using the recommendations of The
Cochrane Collaboration (Higgins 2011).
Assessment of heterogeneity
The assessment of heterogeneity was based upon visual inspec-
tions of the forest plots looking at the overlap of the confidence
intervals, and by the Chi2 test and the I2 statistic as recommended
in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
(Higgins 2011). If substantial heterogeneity was present (I2 greater
than 50%), or when we identified clear heterogeneity by visual
inspection, we used a random-effects model to combine results
and downgraded for inconsistency in the quality of evidence as-
sessment (GRADE).
Assessment of reporting biases
We did not assess publication bias with funnel plots because too
few studies were included in the review. We added no language
restriction to our search strategy in order to avoid potential lan-
guage bias.
Data synthesis
We assessedthe overall qualityof the evidence foreach outcome us-
ing the GRADE approach as recommended in the Cochrane Hand-
book for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011), and
adapted in the updated Cochrane Back and Neck Review Group
method guidelines (Furlan 2015) (Appendix 11). We downgraded
the quality of the evidence by one level according to the follow-
ing criteria: limitation of study design and risk of bias (down-
graded if more than a quarter of the participants were from studies
with a high risk of bias, that is one or more bias domains judged
as high risk), inconsistency of results (downgraded if significant

 heterogeneity was present by visual inspection or if the I2 value
was greater than 50%), imprecision (downgraded if the upper or
lower limits of the 95% confidence interval crossed the MCID
of 9 points (range 0 to 100) (Guyatt 2011), and publication bias
(assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots and using Egger’s test
to investigate publication bias (small-study effects)) (Egger 1997).
If the Egger’s test result was significant (two-tailed P < 0.1), we
would downgrade the quality of evidence (GRADE) by one level
for all meta-analyses (Guyatt 2011b). We did not consider the
indirectness criterion in this review because we included a spe-
cific population with relevant outcomes and direct comparisons
(Guyatt 2011a).
We interpreted the overall quality of evidence using the following
GRADE descriptors (Furlan 2015):
• High-quality evidence: Further research is very unlikely to
change confidence in estimate of effect.
• Moderate-quality evidence: Further research is likely to
have an important impact on confidence in estimate of effect and
may change the estimate.
• Low-quality evidence: Further research is very likely to have
an important impact on confidence in estimate of effect and is
likely to change the estimate.
• Very low-quality evidence: Very little confidence in the
effect estimate.
• No evidence: We identified no randomised controlled trials
that addressed this outcome.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We stratified the analyses based upon the duration of follow-up
reported for each outcome (that is, immediate term, short term,
intermediate term, and long term).
Sensitivity analysis
We did not propose any sensitivity analyses as we expected the
number of available trials to be low.

Results of the search
The search yielded 4449 records, of which two trials fulfilled the
inclusion criteria and were included in the review (Figure 1). An
additional search for ongoing or registered trials in ClinicalTri-
als.gov and the WHO ICTRP retrieved 44 records, of which 9
records included paracetamol as an intervention. One record was
from a study already included in this review (Williams 2014); we
have described the other eight under Excluded studies.

 Included studies
We have included two trials in this review (Nadler 2002; Williams
2014), with a total sample size of 1785 participants (133 and
1653 participants, respectively). We did not include one trial in
the meta-analysis as it did not report results for the placebo group,
and all attempts to contact the authors and the pharmaceutical
company that funded the study were unsuccessful (Nadler 2002).
The trials were conducted in Australia (Williams 2014) and the
United States (Nadler 2002). Both trials included people with
acute LBP (Nadler 2002; Williams 2014). The trials included
934 men and 842 women, most of whom were middle-aged
(mean: 44.2, standard deviation: 13.6), recruited from primary
care. The duration of the treatments was two consecutive days
(Nadler 2002) and daily until recovered, up to a maximum of four
weeks (Williams 2014).
Both trials included single-ingredient paracetamol formulations.
In one trial (Nadler 2002), participants took 1 g of paracetamol
tablets four times per day for two days. In the PACE trial (Williams
2014), participants in the time-contingent group took paraceta-
mol tablets 4g per day in three divided doses, and those in the ’as
required’ group took up to 4 g per day; both groups were asked
to take the paracetamol until recovery up to a maximum of four
weeks. We included all three PACE trial groups in the meta-anal-
yses, following the recommendations of The Cochrane Collabo-
ration (Higgins 2011).
Regarding the primary outcomes, pain intensity was measured on
a 0 to 10 scale in one trial (Williams 2014), and a 0 to 5 scale in
one trial (Nadler 2002). Disability was measured using the Roland
Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) from 0 to 24 points
in all included trials. Williams 2014 also measured quality of life
with the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), and function
using the Patient-Specific Functional Scale from 0 to 10. For the
secondary outcomes, both trials measured adverse events (Nadler
2002; Williams 2014), and one trial measured adherence to the
treatment, use of rescue medication, global impression of recovery
(Global Perceived Effect scale from -5 to +5), and quality of sleep
(number of participants reporting poor sleep quality) (Williams
2014). The rescue medication provided in Williams 2014 was two
days’ supply of naproxen 250 mg (2 tablets initially, and then 1
tablet every 6 to 8 hours as required).
Excluded studies
We excluded a total of 42 full-text articles assessed for eligibil-
ity. Twelve records did not have a placebo group (Cabane 1996;
Childers 2005; Corts Giner 1989; Hackett 1988; Hingorani
1971; Jiang 2008; Kuntz 1996; Lee 2008; Madhusudhan 2013;
McGuinness 1969; Muller 2005; Tervo 1976); eight used a com-
bination of medications for the intervention group (Borenstein
2001; Codding 2008; Garcia Filho 2006; Gimbel 2001; Muller
1998; Peloso 2004; Ruoff 2003; Schiphorst Preuper 2014); six
were notrandomisedcontrolledtrials(De AlmeidaCoimbra 1980;
Derby2012; Gammaitoni 2003; Larsen 2012; Miller2012;Moore
2010); four did not have a paracetamol group (Martinez-Elizondo
1979; Matsushita 2012; Pallay 2004; Yarlas 2013); two were com-
mentaries (Diener 2008; Diener 2008a); one did not include peo-
ple with LBP (Temple 2007); and one trial has been retracted
(Wetzel 2014). The search for ongoing or registered trials re-
trieved eight potentially eligible records that included paracetamol
as an intervention. Seven records used a combination of parac-
etamol and other medications (NCT00210561; NCT00643383;
NCT00736853;
NCT01112267;
NCT01587274;
NCT01776515; NCT01843660), and one record did not have a
placebo group (NCT01422291).

studies are summarised in Figure 2.

Risk of bias summary: review authors’ judgements about each risk of bias item for each included
study.
Allocation
Only one trial had low risk of bias for random sequence generation
and allocation concealment (Williams 2014). We judged one trial
as unclear for both criteria (Nadler 2002).
Blinding
One trial had low risk of bias for blinding for participants and
personnel and outcome assessor (Williams 2014). We considered
one trial unclear for both criteria, as it was not clear which inves-
tigator was blinded (personnel or assessor) (Nadler 2002).
Incomplete outcome data
Both trials successfully described complete outcome data and were
rated as low risk of bias for this criterion. The follow-up rate was
over 90% for both trials.
Selective reporting
Only one trial had low risk of bias for selective reporting (Williams
2014), in which all outcomes of interest were reported. The other
trial was rated as high risk of bias for this criterion. Nadler 2002
did not report data for the placebo group for any time point.
11

 Other potential sources of bias
Both trials received funds from a company that produces paraceta-
mol (Nadler 2002; Williams 2014). One trial was an investigator-
initiated trial that received supplementary funding from a phar-
maceutical company and reported that the sponsor had no role
in conducting the study or analysing the data (Williams 2014).
Given this background and the negative trial outcome, this study
appears to be free of other sources of bias and was rated as low risk
of bias. Nadler 2002 did not report data for the placebo group,
and was rated as unclear for other bias.

compared with placebo for acute low back pain
Acute LBP
Primary outcomes
One large trial with low risk of bias investigated the effect of parac-
etamol compared with placebo for acute LBP (Williams 2014).
There is high-quality evidence that there is no difference between
paracetamol (4 g per day) and placebo for pain at 1 week (imme-
diate term) (mean difference (MD) 1.49, 95% confidence interval
(CI) -1.30 to 4.28), 2 weeks (MD 1.00, 95% CI -1.70 to 3.70),
4 weeks (MD 0.49, 95% CI -1.99 to 2.97), and 12 weeks (short
term) (MD -0.50, 95% CI -2.92 to 1.92) (Analysis 1.1; Figure 3).
There is high-quality evidence that there is no difference between
paracetamol and placebo for disability at 1 week (immediate term)
(MD -0.45, 95% CI -1.15 to 0.25), 2 weeks (MD 0.00, 95% CI -
0.65 to 0.65), 4 weeks (MD 0.05, 95% CI -0.50 to 0.60), and 12
weeks (short term) (MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.59) (Analysis
1.2; Figure 4).

Secondary outcomes
There is high-quality evidence that paracetamol has no effect on
the physical component of quality of life at 4 weeks (MD -0.79,
95% CI -1.94 to 0.36) and 12 weeks (short term) (MD 0.41, 95%
CI -0.91 to 1.72) (Analysis 1.3), and the mental component of
quality life at 4 weeks (MD -0.60, 95% CI -1.38 to 0.17). We
found a statistically significant effect in favour to paracetamol at
12 weeks (short term) for the mental component of quality of life
(MD 0.90, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.72; P = 0.03), however we did not
consider this effect to be clinically important (Analysis 1.4).
There is high-quality evidence that there is no significant differ-
ence between paracetamol and placebo for function at 1 week (im-
mediate term) (MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.22), 2 weeks (MD
-0.15, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.12), 4 weeks (MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.31
to 0.21), and 12 weeks (short term) (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.23 to
0.23) (Analysis 1.5). There is also high-quality evidence that there
is no significant difference between paracetamol and placebo for
global impression of recovery at 1 week (immediate term) (MD -
0.05, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.18), 2 weeks (MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.28
to 0.18), 4 weeks (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.13), and 12

 weeks (short term) (MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.17) (Analysis
1.7).
Adverse events were reported by 296 (19%) participants, of which
nine participants in the paracetamol group and five in the placebo
group reported serious adverse events (that is any event causing
hospitalisation or death). However, we observed no differences
across groups for total adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95%
CI 0.86 to 1.33) or serious adverse events (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.30
to 2.67). The reported serious adverse events were unrelated to
the study treatment (for example asthma attack, bleeding bowel,
infection, hernia, severe back pain, or scheduled surgery) (Analysis
1.6).
We observed no significant differences in the number of partic-
ipants reporting poor sleep quality at 1 week (immediate term)
(RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25), 2 weeks (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.80
to 1.28), 4 weeks (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.52), and 12 weeks
(short term) (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.76), with high-qual-
ity evidence (Analysis 1.8). Finally, there were no significant dif-
ferences between paracetamol and placebo for patient adherence
(RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.22) (Analysis 1.9) or use of rescue
medication (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.55) (Analysis 1.10).
Subacute and chronic LBP
None of the included trials evaluated patients with subacute or
chronic LBP
.
D I S C U S S I O N
Summary of main results
There is high-quality evidence that there is no difference between
paracetamol and placebo for acute LBP on pain, disability, func-
tion, quality of life, and sleep quality outcomes at 1 week (imme-
diate term), 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks (short term) follow-
ups. There is also no difference on global impression of recovery,
patient adherence, and use of rescue medication. Some minor and
serious adverse events were reported for either the paracetamol or
placebo group, but we found no difference between groups. No
trial provided results for long-term follow-up. The results are con-
sistent across all outcome measures and time periods included in
this review.
Although we found a statistically significant effect for the mental
component of quality life at short term for acute LBP
, this result
was not clinically important as it was a difference of 0.90 points
out of 100 points. This significant effect could also be found by
chance due to the large number of analyses in this review.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
None of the trials followed participants for more than 12 weeks
(intermediate- or long-term follow-ups); thus the results of this re-
view are restricted to immediate- and short-term follow-ups, that
is from 1 week to 12 weeks. Moreover, more than 90% of the par-
ticipants analysed in this review are from one large trial (Williams
2014), which included middle-aged Australian participants with
acute LBP; thus care should be taken when generalising the find-
ings of this review to other types of patients, such as those with
chronic symptoms. In addition, we did not find any trial evaluat-
ing paracetamol for subacute or chronic LBP patients.
Quality of the evidence
The quality of evidence provided in this review was high for the
use of paracetamol for acute LBP
, which means that further re-
search is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of ef-
fect. Regarding the risk of bias in the included studies, selective
reporting was the only item considered as high risk of bias in one
trial (Nadler 2002). However, the trial that accounted for the ma-
jority of participants in this review was rated as low risk of bias for
all criteria (Williams 2014).
Potential biases in the review process
Both trials included in this review received funding from a phar-
maceutical company (Nadler 2002; Williams 2014). However, in
one trial the authors stated that the sponsor had no role in con-
ducting the study or analysing the data, and given the negative
outcome of the trial we considered this study to be free of any
potential bias regarding conflicts of interest (Williams 2014).
Moreover, we limited our MEDLINE strategy to studies indexed
with the MeSH term ’humans’ using the limit function in the
database. This could potentially exclude eligible studies not in-
dexed with the MeSH term ’human’. We do not think this is an
issue in this review as we searched a variety of sources and checked
studies from other reviews on the topic.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
The last review on the topic concluded that there was insufficient
evidence to assess the efficacy of paracetamol in people with LBP
(Davies 2008). The authors of that review could not identify any
randomised controlled trial comparing paracetamol to a placebo.
Clinical practice guidelines have been recommending paraceta-
mol, especially for acute patients (Koes 2010), based on presumed
efficacy for related pain conditions and the safety profile compared
to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (van Tulder 2006). This
14

 systematic review provides high-quality evidence that paracetamol
is ineffective for acute LBP
.
Although we found high-quality evidence for acute LBP
, which
is unlikely to change with future research, we believe that more
studies are needed to resolve the uncertainty about the efficacy of
paracetamol for subacute and chronic LBP
, before paracetamol is
completely removed from the recommendations for the manage-
ment of LBP
.
A U T H O R S ’
C O N C L U S I O N S
Implications for practice
The results argue against the use of paracetamol in the manage-
ment of acute LBP
. It is not possible to make recommendations
for or against the use of paracetamol for subacute or chronic LBP
as we did not locate any trials.
Implications for research
The high quality evidence and precise estimate of no effect for
acute LBP suggests that no additional trials of paracetamol for
acute LBP are required. For acute LBP the research questions in-
clude establishingwhatanalgesicmedicine(s)shouldreplace parac-
etamol as the first line analgesic for acute LBP; and evaluating if
combination medicines containing paracetamol are effective. In
contrast we could not locate any evidence for subacute or chronic
LBP and so future research evaluating the efficacy of paracetamol
for these patients is required to clarify the uncertainty.

Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID]
Nadler 2002
Methods
Randomised, actively controlled, multicentre, single-blind study
Participants
Population source: 371 participants with acute non-specific LBP of at least moderate
pain intensity (133 participants randomised to paracetamol or placebo group). The study
was conducted at 11 sites
Inclusion criteria: Pain of moderate intensity (2 or more on a 6-point scale), age 18
to 55 years (inclusive), ambulatory status, no low back trauma within the preceding 48
hours, and an answer of “yes” to the question “Do the muscles in your low back hurt?”
Exclusion criteria: Any evidence or history of radiculopathy or other neurologic deficits
(e.g. abnormal straight-leg-raise test results, patellar reflexes, or bowel or bladder func-
tion), or a history of back surgery, fibromyalgia, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular
disease, osteoporosis, gastrointestinal ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, re-
nal disease, pulmonary oedema, cardiomyopathy, liver disease, intrinsic coagulation de-
fects, bleeding diseases or anticoagulant therapy (e.g. warfarin), daily back pain for more
than 3 consecutive months, or hypersensitivity to acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, or heat
Interventions
The intervention groups consisted of
1. heat wrap (ThermaCare Heat Wrap; Procter & Gamble, Cincinnati, OH), which
wraps around the lumbar region of the torso and uses a velcro-like closure, heats to 104
degrees F (40 degrees C) within 30 minutes of exposure to air, and maintains this
temperature continuously for 8 hours of wear;
2. oral ibuprofen, 2 tablets 3 times daily for a total dose of 1200 mg, with oral
placebo 1 time daily for blinding from the acetaminophen group;
3. oral acetaminophen, 2 tablets 4 times daily for a total of 4000 mg dose total;
4. oral placebo, 2 tablets 4 times daily; and
5. unheated back wrap.
All treatments were administered on 2 consecutive days
Outcomes
Primary: pain relief (NRS 0 to 5), disability (Roland Morris 0 to 24)
Secondary: safety.
Notes
Funding: This study was funded by the Procter & Gamble Company.
Conflicts of interest: Industry funds were received to support this work. 6 out of 8 study
authors are employees of the Procter & Gamble Health Sciences Institute, and 1 author
is a paid consultant for Procter & Gamble Company

Methods
Multicentre, double-dummy, randomised, placebo-controlled trial
Participants
Population source: 1653 participants (acetaminophen n = 550, acetaminophen as re-
quired n = 546, placebo n = 547) recruited from primary care clinicians (general practi-
tioners, pharmacists, or physiotherapists) across Sydney, Australia, screened consecutive
people who sought care for LBP directly or in response to a community advertisement
Inclusion criteria: A new episode of acute LBP (defined as pain between the 12th rib
and buttock crease that was less than 6 weeks’ duration and preceded by 1 month of no
pain) with or without leg pain, and at least moderate-intensity pain (measured by an
adaptation of item 7 of the SF-36)
Exclusion criteria: Suspected serious spinal pathology; currently using full regular rec-
ommended doses of an analgesic; spinal surgery in the preceding 6 months; contraindi-
cation to paracetamol; using psychotropic medication for a health condition deemed to
prevent reliable recording of study information; or pregnant or planning pregnancy
Interventions
Participants were asked to take 2 types of tablets for up to 4 weeks: 2 tablets from the
regular box every 6 to 8 hours (6 tablets per day), and 1 or 2 tablets from the as-needed
box when needed for pain relief (4 to 6 hours apart, to a maximum of 8 tablets per day)
. Participants in the regular group received 665 mg modified-release paracetamol tablets

in the regular box and placebo tablets in the as-needed box. Participants in the as-needed
group received placebo tablets in the regular box and 500 mg paracetamol immediate-
release tablets in the as-needed box. Participants in the placebo group received placebo
tablets in both boxes
Outcomes
Pain (0 to 10), disability (Roland Morris 0 to 24), function (Patient-Specific Functional
Scale), quality of life (SF-12), global impression of recovery (Global Perceived Effect
scale), sleep quality, adherence, adverse events

Appendix 10. ’Risk of bias’ criteria
Random sequence generation (selection bias)
Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate generation of a randomised sequence
There is a low risk of selection bias if the investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring
to a random number table, using a computer random number generator, coin tossing, shuffling cards or envelopes, throwing dice,
drawing of lots, minimisation (minimisation may be implemented without a random element, and this is considered to be equivalent
to being random).
There is a high risk of selection bias if the investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process such
as: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth, date (or day) of admission, hospital or clinic record number, or allocation by
judgement of the clinician, preference of the participant, results of a laboratory test or a series of tests, or availability of the intervention.
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate concealment of allocations prior to assignment
There is a low risk of selection bias if the participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because
one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based,
and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; or sequentially numbered,
opaque, sealed envelopes.
There is a high risk of bias if participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce
selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (for example a list of random numbers); assign-
ment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (for example if envelopes were unsealed or non-opaque or not sequentially
numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; or other explicitly unconcealed procedures.
Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias)
Performance bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by participants or personnel/care providers during the study
There is a low risk of performance bias if blinding of participants or personnel was ensured and it was unlikely that the blinding could
have been broken; or if there was no blinding or incomplete blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome is not likely to
be influenced by lack of blinding.
41

 Blinding of outcome assessor (detection bias)
Detection bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by outcome assessors
There is low risk of detection bias if the blinding of the outcome assessment was ensured and it was unlikely that the blinding could
have been broken; or if there was no blinding or incomplete blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome is not likely to
be influenced by lack of blinding, or:
• for participant-reported outcomes in which the participant was the outcome assessor (e.g. pain, disability): there is a low risk of
bias for outcome assessors if there is a low risk of bias for participant blinding (Boutron 2005);
• for outcome criteria that are clinical or therapeutic events that will be determined by the interaction between participants and
care providers (e.g. co-interventions, length of hospitalisation, treatment failure), in which the care provider is the outcome assessor:
there is a low risk of bias for outcome assessors if there is a low risk of bias for care providers (Boutron 2005);
• for outcome criteria that are assessed from data from medical forms: there is a low risk of bias if the treatment or adverse effects
of the treatment could not be noticed in the extracted data (Boutron 2005).
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
Attrition bias due to amount, nature, or handling of incomplete outcome data
There is a low risk of attrition bias if: there were no missing outcome data; reasons for missing outcome data were unlikely to be related
to the true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias); missing outcome data were balanced in numbers,
with similar reasons for missing data across groups; for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with
the observed event risk was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate; for continuous outcome
data, the plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes was not enough to have
a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size, or missing data were imputed using appropriate methods (if dropouts are very large,
imputation using even ’acceptable’ methods may still suggest a high risk of bias) (van Tulder 2003). The percentage of withdrawals and
dropouts should not exceed 20% for short-term follow-up and 30% for long-term follow-up and should not lead to substantial bias
(these percentages are commonly used but arbitrary, not supported by literature) (van Tulder 2003).
Selective reporting (reporting bias)
Reporting bias due to selective outcome reporting
There is a low risk of reporting bias if the study protocol is available and all of the study’s prespecified (primary and secondary) outcomes
that are of interest in the review have been reported in the prespecified way, or if the study protocol is not available but it is clear that
the published reports include all expected outcomes, including those that were prespecified (convincing text of this nature may be
uncommon).
There is a high risk of reporting bias if not all of the study’s prespecified primary outcomes have been reported; one or more primary
outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods, or subsets of the data (for example subscales) that were not prespecified;
one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an
unexpected adverse effect); one or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered
in a meta-analysis; the study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a
study.
Other bias
Bias due to problems not covered elsewhere in the table
There is a low risk of bias if the study appears to be free of other sources of bias not addressed elsewhere (for example study funding).

 Appendix 11. The GRADE approach to evidence synthesis
The quality of evidence will be categorised as follows:
• High (
): further research is very unlikely to change the confidence in the estimate of effect.
• Moderate (
�): further research is likely to have an important impact in the confidence in the estimate of effect.
• Low (
��): further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is
likely to change the estimate.
• Very Low (
���): any estimate of effect is very uncertain.
The evidence available to answer each subquestion will be graded on the domains in the following manner:
1. Study design
2. Risk of bias
Limitations in the study design and implementation may bias the estimates of the treatment effect. Our confidence in the estimate of
the effect and in the following recommendation decreases if studies suffer from major limitations. We will examine all studies on five
types of biases:
a) Selection (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, group similarities at baseline)
b) Performance (blinding of participants, blinding of healthcare providers)
c) Attrition (dropouts and intention-to-treat analysis)
d) Measurement (blinding of the outcome assessors and timing of outcome assessment)
e) Reporting bias (selective reporting)
3. Inconsistency
Inconsistency refers to an unexplained heterogeneity of results. Widely differing estimates of the treatment effect (i.e. heterogeneity
or variability in results) across studies suggest true differences in underlying treatment effect. Inconsistency may arise from differences
in: populations (e.g. drugs may have larger relative effects in sicker populations), interventions (e.g. larger effects with higher drug
doses), or outcomes (e.g. diminishing treatment effect with time).
The quality of evidence will be downgraded as follows:
• by one level: when the heterogeneity or variability in results is large.
• by two levels: when the heterogeneity or variability in results is large AND there was inconsistency arising from populations,
interventions, or outcomes.
4. Indirectness
Indirect population, intervention, comparator, or outcome: the question being addressed in this systematic review is different from the
available evidence regarding the population, intervention, comparator, or an outcome in the included randomised trial.
The quality of evidence will be downgraded as follows:
• by one level: when there is indirectness in only one area
• by two levels: when there is indirectness in two or more areas
5. Imprecision
Results are imprecise when studies include relatively few participants and few events and thus have wide confidence intervals around the
estimate of the effect. In such a case we judge the quality of the evidence to be lower than it otherwise would be because of uncertainty
in the results. Each outcome is considered separately.
43
Paracetamol for low back pain (Review)

 For dichotomous outcomes
We will consider imprecision for either of the following two reasons:
1. There is only one study (unless the study provide data from more than 300 participants). When there is more than one study,
the total number of events is less than 300 (a threshold rule-of-thumb value) (Mueller 2007).
2. 95% confidence interval around the pooled or best estimate of effect includes both 1) no effect and 2) appreciable benefit or
appreciable harm. The threshold for ’appreciable benefit’ or ’appreciable harm’ is a relative risk reduction (RRR) or relative risk
increase (RRI) greater than 25%.
The quality of the evidence will be downgraded as follows:
• by one level: when there is imprecision due to (1) or (2)
• by two levels: when there is imprecision due to (1) and (2)
For continuous outcomes
We will consider imprecision for either of the following two reasons:
1. There is only one study (unless the study provide data from more than 400 participants). When there is more than one study,
total population size is less than 400 (a threshold rule-of-thumb value; using the usual α and β, and an effect size of 0.2 standard
deviations, representing a small effect).
2. 95% confidence interval includes no effect and the upper or lower confidence limit crosses an effect size (standardised mean
difference) of 0.5 in either direction.
The quality of the evidence will be downgraded as follows:
• by one level: when there is imprecision due to (1) or (2)
• by two levels: when there is imprecision due to (1) and (2)
6. Publication bias
Publication bias is a systematic underestimate or an overestimate of the underlying beneficial or harmful effect due to the selective
publication of studies.
The quality of evidence will be downgraded as follows:
• by one level: when the funnel plot suggests publication bias
7. Magnitude of the effect
8. Dose response gradient
9. Influence of all plausible residual confounding

 From Andrew Miller, 24 November 2018
Summary
In this manuscript [1], the authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of paracetamol (aka ac-
etaminophen) for non-specific low back pain (LBP) in which 3 randomized controlled trials (RCT) were included in the review (2
LBPAcute [2,3], 1 LBPChronic [4]), and two RCTs were included in the meta-analysis (1 LBPAcute [3], 1 LBPChronic [4]). There
are significant limitations to this analysis that undermine the manuscript and invalidate the conclusions. The studies included in the
meta-analysis assessed two different patient populations (1 acute, 1 chronic). Additionally, while one was a publication by one of the
meta-analysis co-authors (CG Maher) [3], the other was a retracted study [4,5]. Dr. Kietaibl (formerly Kozek-Langenecker) did not
consent to manuscript publication and demanded retraction after discovering deceptive practices by some co-authors that resulted in
fraudulent data [5]. Moreover, Dr. Kietaibl was not contacted by the authors of this meta-analysis to determine the reasons for retraction.
Including a retracted study in a meta-analysis means transferring major errors from a single study into the highest level of evidence,
thereby compromising and invalidating the meta-analysis results. Moreover, excluding the retracted study would have prevented the
performance of a meta-analysis at all. The results of this analysis are not valid, and readers should be cautioned against applying them
in clinical practice.

Reply
We welcome Dr. Miller’s comments. However, one of his criticisms seems exaggerated. He suggested that our inclusion of the retracted
study by Wetzel et al. invalidates the review. This is not the case. This study contributed to only one treatment comparison, one
involving ”very low quality“ evidence. The inclusion or deletion of this one study from our meta-analysis will not change the key
message of the review.
To clarify our procedures, it is important to mention that we attempted to contact the authors of the retracted study a couple of times
with no success. Then we notified the Cochrane Back and Neck Group prior to the inclusion of the paper and acknowledged the
retracted study in the review. The retraction notice from European Journal of Anaesthesiology states that the reason for retracting was
because one author did not consent to the publication, with no mention of fraudulent data as Dr Miller asserts.
Nevertheless, after discussing this issue with the Editors of the Cochrane Back & Neck Group and with upcoming guidance from the
Editorial and Methods Department, our decision is to exclude the study from the review.

This is an update of a review published in the BMJ (Machado 2015). The study protocol was previously registered on PROSPERO
(registration number CRD42013006367). We followed the new recommendations of the Cochrane Back and Neck Group in this
review (Furlan 2015), which was not stated in the protocol or previous version of this review as it was not yet published. However,
there were no substantial changes from the protocol or the previous version of this review.
