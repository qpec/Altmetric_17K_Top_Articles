Background: Colorectal cancer is a common malignancy and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. The metabolism
of omega fatty acids has been implicated in tumour growth and metastasis.
Methods: This study has characterised the expression of omega fatty acid metabolising enzymes CYP4A11, CYP4F11, CYP4V2 and
CYP4Z1 using monoclonal antibodies we have developed. Immunohistochemistry was performed on a tissue microarray
containing 650 primary colorectal cancers, 285 lymph node metastasis and 50 normal colonic mucosa.
Results: The differential expression of CYP4A11 and CYP4F11 showed a strong association with survival in both the whole patient
cohort (hazard ratio (HR) ¼ 1.203, 95% CI ¼ 1.092–1.324, w2 ¼ 14.968, P ¼ 0.001) and in mismatch repair-proficient tumours
(HR ¼ 1.276, 95% CI ¼ 1.095–1.488, w2 ¼ 9.988, P ¼ 0.007). Multivariate analysis revealed that the differential expression of CYP4A11
and CYP4F11 was independently prognostic in both the whole patient cohort (P ¼ 0.019) and in mismatch repair proficient
tumours (P ¼ 0.046).
Conclusions: A significant and independent association has been identified between overall survival and the differential
expression of CYP4A11 and CYP4F11 in the whole patient cohort and in mismatch repair-proficient tumours.
Colorectal cancer is one of the major contributors to cancer-related
mortality in the developed world (Siegel et al, 2014, 2016). The
introduction of screening programmes and the development of
new drugs have improved the survival rate of colorectal cancer
patients; however, the average 5-year survival rate remains poor at
55% (Brenner et al, 2014). The characterisation of novel biomarker
targets can further improve the survival rate, as it provides a better
understanding of the complex molecular events underpinning
tumour development and, if clinically validated, these biomarkers
have potential roles in screening, diagnosis, prognosis and
monitoring disease progression (Coghlin and Murray, 2015;
Alnabulsi and Murray, 2016).
The CYP4 cytochrome P450 family of enzymes metabolises
omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids to biologically active eicosanoids
that are implicated in tumour initiation, development and
progression (Yu et al, 2011; Johnson et al, 2015). Arachidonic
acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, is converted by CYP4A11 to
20-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), which is considered a
key modulator in tumour progression, angiogenesis and metastasis
(Ljubimov and Grant, 2005; Guo et al, 2007). CYP4F11 is not an
efficient metaboliser of arachidonic acid compared with CYP4A11;
however, it is the predominant CYP4 enzyme involved in the
metabolism of omega 3-fatty acids (Dhar et al, 2008). The substrate
specificity is not yet fully characterised for CYP4V2 and CYP4Z1

 (Guengerich and Cheng, 2011). Despite the recognition of the
involvement of omega fatty acids in tumourigenesis, the role of the
cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in this pathway has received
very limited attention in cancer biology (Panigrahy et al, 2010).
Using
monoclonal
antibodies
we
have
developed
the
cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP4A11, CYP4F11, CYP4V2 and
CYP4Z1; this study has profiled the expression of these enzymes by
immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray containing a large
and well-characterised cohort of colorectal cancers. The expression
profile of each enzyme was established by light microscopy using a
semi-quantitative scoring system. The prognostic significance of
each enzyme was determined by assessing the relationship between
their expression in tumours and overall survival.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Monoclonal antibody development. Monoclonal antibodies to
CYP4A11, CYP4V2 and CYP4Z1 were developed using short
synthetic peptides (Murray et al, 1998). Multiple sequence
alignments of the amino acid sequences were performed on these
enzymes and other CYP4 family members, to identify regions with
the highest amino acid diversity. To avoid poorly antigenic
sequences of amino acids (e.g., transmembrane region), a range of
bioinformatics tools were used to predict and model hydrophilic,
accessible and antigenic polypeptide sequences, as well as the
secondary and tertiary structures of each enzyme (Supplementary
Materials and Methods S1).
The amino acid sequences of peptides used to generate the
antibodies and their location on each enzyme are specified in
Supplementary Table S1. All peptides (Almac Sciences Ltd,
Edinburgh, UK) were conjugated to ovalbumin for immunisations
and to bovine serum albumin for the enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assay (ELISA) screenings (Duncan et al, 1992). The
immunisation via the subcutaneous route, the production of
hybridomas and the ELISA screenings were carried out as
previously described (Murray et al, 1996, 1998; Brown et al,
2014). The development of the monoclonal antibody to CYP4F11
has been described previously (Kumarakulasingham et al, 2005).
Immunoblotting. The specificity of the monoclonal antibodies
was established by immunoblotting using whole-cell lysate (human
embryonic kidney cells-HEK 293, Novus Biologicals, Cambridge,
UK) overexpressing the relevant CYP as a positive control and
lysates from cells containing empty vector as a negative control.
Microsomal fractions prepared from human liver tissues (BD

Human
Liver
Microsomes

Donors
20 mg ml � 1 catalogue number 452172, BD Biosciences, Bedford,
MA, USA) were also used to carry out immunoblotting validation
for each antibody. The immunoblotting was carried out as
described, except that the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane
was incubated overnight at 4 1C with undiluted monoclonal
antibody (neat hybridoma tissue culture supernatant) and the
secondary
antibody,
horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated
anti-
mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK), was diluted 1/3000 in
phosphate-buffered saline–Tween-20 (Swan et al, 2016). When
using liver microsomes, 30 mg of samples were loaded per lane
compared with 5 mg when using overexpression lysate.
Patient cohort and colorectal cancer tissue microarray. The
patient cohort was retrospectively acquired from the Grampian
Biorepository (www.biorepository.nhsgrampian.org). The cohort is
composed of tissue samples from 650 patients who had undergone
surgery for primary colorectal cancers between 1994 and 2009, at
Aberdeen Royal Infirmary (Aberdeen, UK), which is the principal
teaching hospital of NHS Grampian. Patients who had received
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy were excluded.
Survival time was defined to be the period in whole months
from the date of surgery to the date of death from any cause (i.e.,
all-cause mortality). Survival data on a 6-monthly basis was
updated from the NHS Grampian electronic patient management
system and no patients were lost to follow-up. At the time (March
2012) of the censoring of patient outcome data, there had been 309
(47.5%) deaths and patients who were still alive were censored. The
median survival was 103 months (95% CI ¼ 86–120 months), the
mean survival was 115 months (95% CI ¼ 108–123 months) and
the median follow-up time, calculated by the ‘reverse Kaplan–
Meier’ method, was 88 months (95% CI ¼ 79–97 months). The
clinico-pathological characteristics of the patients and their
association with survival are described in Table 1.
Histopathology reporting was in accordance with The Royal
College of Pathologists UK guidelines for the histopathological

 reporting of resection specimens of colorectal cancer, which
includes guidance from version 5 of the tumour, node, metastasis
staging system (Williams et al, 2007).
Blocks of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens
were used to construct the tissue microarray as previously
described (O’Dwyer et al, 2011; Brown et al, 2014; Swan et al,
2016). The histopathological processing of tissue specimens and
the construction of the tissue microarray are described in
Supplementary Materials and Methods S1
Immunohistochemistry. A Dako autostainer (Dako, Ely, UK) was
used to perform the immunohistochemistry for each antibody
using the Dako EnVision system (Dako; Kumarakulasingham et al,
2005, Brown et al, 2014). Antigen retrieval (microwaving in 10 mM
citrate buffer pH 6.0 for 20 min) was performed for all antibodies,
except CYP4A11. The immunohistochemistry procedure and the
antigen retrieval are described in Supplementary Materials and
Methods S1. A semi-quantitative scoring system was used to
evaluate the intensity of immunostaining of each antibody
(Kumarakulasingham et al, 2005; O’Dwyer et al, 2011; Brown
et al, 2016; Swan et al, 2016). The scoring was conducted
independently by two observers (RS and GIM) who were unaware
of the clinical data and outcome. The assessment of cores was
performed using light microscopy (Olympus BX 51, Olympus,
Southend-on-Sea, Essex, UK). Simultaneous re-evaluation of the
cores by both investigators was used to resolve any discrepancies in
the scores (o5% of cases).
Assessment of MMR status. The status of mismatch repair
protein (MMR) in the patient cohort was classified as either
defective
or
proficient,
based
on
the
immunohistochemical
assessment of MLH1 and MSH2 proteins (Brown et al, 2014).
Data analysis and statistics. The data were entered into an Excel
2013 spreadsheet before being analysed using IBM SPSS version 24
for Windows 7 (IBM, Portsmouth, UK). The following statistical
tests were used: Mann–Whitney U-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test,
w2-test, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, log-rank test and Cox
multivariate analysis (variables entered as categorical variables)
including the calculation of hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. A
probability value of Pp0.05 was regarded as statistically sig-
nificant. The survival analysis of the different patients groups was
conducted using the log-rank test. The scores for each protein were
dichotomised using the following cutoff points; negative staining vs
positive staining, negative and weak staining vs moderate and
strong staining, and strong staining vs negative/weak/moderate
staining. Further details of data analysis and statistics are provided
in Supplementary Materials and Methods S1.
Ethics. The use of colorectal tissue samples in this study was
approved by the Grampian Biorepository scientific access group
committee (Tissue request number 0002). No written consent was
required from patients for the use of formalin fixed wax embedded
tissue samples in the colorectal cancer tissue microarray.
RESULTS
Monoclonal
antibodies. During
the
hybridoma
production,
sequential ELISA screenings (immunogenic peptide specific to
each enzyme) were used to determine the specificity of the
monoclonal antibodies towards CYP4A11, CYP4V2 and CYP4Z1
(Duncan et al, 1992). Furthermore, immunoblotting showed a
band migrating at the expected molecular weight for each
antibody, whereas no band was detected in the negative controls
(Supplementary Figure S1). The specificity of the antibody to
CYP4F11 was confirmed previously (Kumarakulasingham et al,
2005).
Immunohistochemistry. CYP4A11, CYP4F11 and CYP4V2 anti-
bodies showed immunoreactivity in normal colonic epithelium,
primary colorectal tumours and lymph node metastasis, whereas
CYP4Z1 showed immunoreactivity only in a very small proportion
of primary tumours. The immunostaining was exclusively localised
to the cytoplasm of the cells (Supplementary Figure S2). Intra-
tumour heterogeneity was not observed in either primary or
metastatic colorectal tumours.
There was a significant increase in the intensity of immunos-
taining in primary tumours compared with normal colonic mucosa
for CYP4A11 (Po0.001), CYP4F11 (Po0.001) and CYP4V2
(Po0.001) (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S3). In contrast, a
significant decrease in the expression of CYP4A11 (P ¼ 0.007),
CYP4F11 (Po0.001) and CYP4V2 (Po0.001) was observed in
lymph node metastasis compared with all primary tumours. There
was also a significant decrease in the expression of CYP4A11
(P ¼ 0.002), CYP4F11 (Po0.001) and CYP4V2 (Po0.001) in
lymph node metastasis compared with their corresponding
primary Dukes C tumours.
Relationship with pathological parameters. The relationships
between the main pathological parameters and the expression of
CYP4A11, CYP4F11, CYP4V2 and CYP4Z1 are summarised
in Supplementary Tables S2A–C. Both CYP4A11 (w2 ¼ 13.148,
P ¼ 0.041) and CYP4V2 (w2 ¼ 24.474, Po0.001) showed signifi-
cant associations with Dukes stage, but only CYP4V2 displayed a
significant relationship with tumour stage (w2 ¼ 17.837, P ¼ 0.037).
The expression of CYP4A11 was significantly associated with
tumour site (w2 ¼ 15.703, P ¼ 0.015). CYP4F11 also showed
significant associations with tumour site (w2 ¼ 20.947, P ¼ 0.002),
tumour differentiation (w2 ¼ 8.5552, P ¼ 0.036) and MMR status
(w2 ¼ 13.441, P ¼ 0.004).
Survival analysis
Whole patient cohort. Different cutoff points of the immunos-
taining scores were used to investigate the association between the
expression of CYP4A11, CYP4F11 and CYP4V2, and overall
survival (Supplementary Table S3). The expression of CYP4A11
showed a consistent and significant association with overall
survival (Figure 1). Overall, increasing intensity of CYP4A11
immunostaining was significantly associated with poorer outcome

 (HR ¼ 1.135, 95% CI ¼ 1.032–1.249, w2 ¼ 9.080, P ¼ 0.028). When
each level of the intensity groups of CYP4A11 expression was
considered independently using one reference group (negative
expression), strong CYP4A11 immunostaining was significantly
associated with poorer outcome (HR ¼ 1.541, 95% CI ¼ 1.144–
2.077, w2 ¼ 8.006, P ¼ 0.005) (Supplementary Table S4). The
median survival was 137 months (95% CI undefined) and the
mean was 132 months (95% CI ¼ 117–147 months) for CYP4A11-
negative tumours (n ¼ 175), whereas the median survival was 75
months (95% CI ¼ 58–91 months) and the mean was 96 months
(95% CI ¼ 84–109 months) for CYP4A11 strong expression
tumours (n ¼ 197).
Immunoreactivity for CYP4A11 was significantly associated
with
poorer
prognosis
(HR ¼ 1.346,
95%
CI ¼ 1.032–1.756,
w2 ¼ 4.881, P ¼ 0.027) when compared with CYP4A11-negative
tumours. For CYP4A11-positive tumours (n ¼ 450), the median
survival was 88 months (95% CI ¼ 71–104 months) and the mean
was 105 months (95% CI ¼ 96–114 months), compared with a
median of 137 (95% CI undefined) and a mean of 132 months
(95% CI ¼ 117–147 months) for CYP4A11-negative tumours
(n ¼ 175). Comparing strong CYP4A11-expressing tumours with
negative/weak/moderate-expressing tumours also showed a sig-
nificant association with survival (HR ¼ 1.379, 95% CI ¼ 1.089–
1.746, w2 ¼ 7.234, P ¼ 0.007). The median survival was 113 months
(95% CI ¼ 89–136 months) and the mean was 124 months (95%
CI ¼ 114–134 months) for negative/weak/moderate CYP4A11-
immunostaining tumours (n ¼ 428), whereas the median survival
was 75 months (95% CI ¼ 58–91 months) and the mean was 96
months (95% CI ¼ 84–109 months) for strong CYP4A11-immu-
nostaining tumours (n ¼ 197).
Exploratory analysis of CYP4 enzyme expression showed there
was a significant association between the differential (combined)
expression
of
CYP4A11
and
CYP4F11,
and
survival
(Supplementary Table S5). Therefore, a new variable, based on
the differential expression of CYP4A11 and CYP4F11, was created
to stratify tumours into three groups; CYP4A114CYP4F11,
CYP4A11 ¼ CYP4F11 and CYP4A11oCYP4F11. Overall survival
was
significantly
associated
with
the
expression
profiles
of CYP4A114CYP4F11, CYP4A11 ¼ CYP4F11 and CYP4A11o
CYP4F11 groups (HR ¼ 1.311, 95% CI ¼ 1.140–1.506, w2 ¼ 14.968,
P ¼ 0.001) (Figure 2). When each level of the differential
expression groups was considered independently using pairwise
comparisons and one reference group (CYP4A11oCYP4F11),
both CYP4A114CYP4F11 (HR ¼ 1.733, 95% CI ¼ 1.306–2.300,
w2 ¼ 14.405, P ¼ o0.001) and CYP4A11 ¼ CYP4F11 (HR ¼ 1.432,
95% CI ¼ 1.064–1.928, w2 ¼ 5.425, P ¼ 0.020) were significantly
associated with poorer outcome (Supplementary Table S6). The
mean survival was 137 months (95% CI ¼ 124–151 months)
(median survival undefined) for the CYP4A11oCYP4F11 group
(n ¼ 214), the median survival was 95 months (95% CI ¼ 72–117

(Figure

and
Supplementary Table S11). When each level of the intensity
groups of CYP4A11 expression was considered separately using
pairwise comparisons and one reference group (negative expres-
sion), strong CYP4A11 immunoreactivity was significantly asso-
ciated with poorer prognosis (HR ¼ 1.644, 95% CI ¼ 1.183–2.284,
w2 ¼ 8.626, P ¼ 0.003) (Supplementary Table S4). When comparing
strong CYP4A11-expressing tumours with negative/weak/moder-
ate-expressing tumours, the strong expression of CYP4A11 showed
a significant association with worse survival (HR ¼ 1.491, 95%
CI ¼ 1.152–1.929, w2 ¼ 9.404, P ¼ 0.002). The positive expression
of CYP4A11 was also significantly associated with poorer outcome
when positive CYP4A11-expressing tumours were compared with
negative
CYP4A11-expressing
tumours
(HR ¼ 1.375,
95%
CI ¼ 1.022–1.851, w2 ¼ 4.485, P ¼ 0.034).
There was also a significant association between the differential
expression of CYP4A11 and CYP4F11, and survival in MMR-
proficient tumours (HR ¼ 1.276, 95% CI ¼ 1.05–1.488, w2 ¼ 9.988,
P ¼ 0.007) (Figure 2). When each level of the intensity groups was
considered independently using pairwise comparisons and one
reference group (CYP4A11oCYP4F11), CYP4A114CYP4F11-
expressing tumours were significantly associated with poorer
outcome
(HR ¼ 1.629,
95%
CI ¼ 1.199–2.214,
w2 ¼ 9.261,
P ¼ 0.002) (Supplementary Table S6). The median survival was
75 months (95% CI ¼ 85–121 months) and the mean was 97
months (95% CI ¼ 83–111 months) for CYP4A114CYP4F11-
expressing tumours (n ¼ 181), whereas the mean survival was 137
months (95% CI ¼ 123–151 months) (median survival undefined)
for CYP4A11oCYP4F11-expressing tumours (n ¼ 186).
Mismatch repair protein-deficient cohort. The lack of expression
of CYP4F11 was significantly associated with worse overall survival
compared with CYP4F11-positive tumours (HR ¼ 0.479, 95%
CI ¼ 0.241–0.952, w2 ¼ 4.682, P ¼ 0.03) (Supplementary Table S11
and Supplementary Figure S4). The median survival was 28 (95%
CI ¼ 21–34 months) and the mean was 49 months (95% CI ¼
28–70 months) for CYP4F11-negative tumours (n ¼ 16) compared
with a median of 114 (95% CI ¼ 78–149 months) and a mean of
104 months (95% CI ¼ 84–123 months) for CYP4F11-positive
tumours (n ¼ 77).
Overall, the association between survival and the differential
expression of CYP4A11 and CYP4F11 just failed to reach the
threshold for statistical significance in MMR-deficient cohort
(HR ¼ 1.433,
95%
CI ¼ 0.993–2.067,
w2 ¼ 5.676,

(Figure 2). When each level of the intensity groups was considered

 Multivariate analysis. To evaluate the prognostic value of the
differential expression of CYP4A11 and CYP4F11 (as a single
variable) in relation to established prognostic parameters, multi-
variate analysis was performed using ‘Forward Stepwise: Condi-
tional LR’ Cox regression method. The model showed there was a
significant
and
independent
prognostic
value
of
using
the
differential expression of CYP4A11 and CYP4F11 in the whole
patient cohort (P ¼ 0.019) and in MMR-proficient tumours
(P ¼ 0.046) (Table 3 and Supplementary Tables S12 and S13).
The differential expression was also a significant independent
prognostic
indicator
in
a
multivariate
analysis
using
only
parameters that would be available at the time of biopsy in both
the whole patient cohort (P ¼ 0.001) and in MMR-proficient
tumours (P ¼ 0.006) (Supplementary Table S14).
DISCUSSION
The rise in incidence and the poor survival rate makes colorectal
cancer a major health burden in the developed world (Brenner
et al, 2014; Siegel et al, 2014, 2016). There is still urgent need to
identify and validate biomarkers of colorectal cancer that can play
a role in clinical practice (Alnabulsi and Murray, 2016).
In this study, we have produced monoclonal antibodies to P450
enzymes CYP4A11, CYP4V2 and CYP4Z1 using short synthetic
peptides that are specific to the targets of interest. The antibody for
CYP4F11 was generated in a previous study (Kumarakulasingham
et al, 2005). The antibodies were used to profile the expression of
each enzyme by immunohistochemistry, which was performed on
a well-characterised colorectal cancer tissue microarray.
The cytochrome P450 superfamily is classified into families,
subfamilies and individual forms according to sequence homology
and substrate specificity (Spector, 2009; Almira Correia et al, 2011;
Fleming, 2011). Members of CYP1, CYP2 and CYP3 families are
the major xenobiotic metabolising enzymes whose roles in cancer
have been extensively studied (Murray et al, 1991, 1993, 1999,
2001, 2010; Rodriguez-Antona et al, 2010; Stenstedt et al, 2012;
Xu et al, 2012). The CYP4 and higher numbered families are
involved in the metabolism of a diverse range of endogenous
compounds
including
eicosanoids,
fatty
acids,
steroids
and
vitamins (Spector, 2009; Arnold et al, 2010; Panigrahy et al,
2010; Fleming, 2011; Guengerich and Cheng, 2011; Niwa et al,
2011). The role of CYP4 family and higher numbered families is
not well studied in tumour biology with the exception of those
CYPs involved in sex hormone metabolism in relation to breast
and prostate cancer (Brueggemeier et al, 2005; Leroux, 2005; Stein
et al, 2012). Therefore, this study aimed to examine the role of the
main CYP4 family enzymes in colorectal cancer by characterising
the expression of these enzymes using a large and well-
characterised patient cohort.
This study revealed there was a significant increase in the
expression of CYP4A11 in primary colorectal tumours compared
with normal colonic mucosa and the increased expression was
significantly associated with poorer prognosis. Consistent with our
finding, an upregulation of CYP4A11 was demonstrated by a
cDNA microarray-bioinformatics analysis of 10 colorectal tumours
and their corresponding normal tissues (Yeh et al, 2006).
Furthermore, the overexpression of CYP4A11 has been linked to
rise in 20-HETE levels and upregulation of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9)
in non-small cell lung cancer (Yu et al, 2011). Both VEGF and
MMP-9 are strong promoters of tumour invasion and metastasis
(Yu et al, 2011; Goel and Mercurio, 2013; Brown and Murray,
2015). Previous research also showed that using selective inhibitors
to downregulate the expression of CYP4A11 in cell lines and
animal
models
resulted

 angiogenesis and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer, renal
adenocarcinoma and glioma (Guo et al, 2008, Alexanian et al,
2009, Yu et al, 2011). Our data have shown CYP4A11 is
overexpressed in colorectal cancer; therefore, CYP4A11 may be a
relevant therapeutic target in this type of cancer.
Comparing primary colorectal tumours to normal colonic
mucosa also showed there was a significant increase in the
expression of CYP4F11, which is a novel finding. In recent
research, CYP4F11 expressed in cell lines (non-small cell lung
cancer) converted oxalamides and benzothiazoles into stearoyl
CoA desaturase (SCD) inhibitors (Theodoropoulos et al, 2016).
Stearoyl CoA desaturase is emerging as a therapeutic target in
cancer and therefore colorectal tumours with high CYP4F11
expression may be a valid target for SCD-targeted therapy.
The differential expression of CYP4A11 and CYP4F11 emerged
as the best prognostic marker in this study. The distinct prognostic
impact of the differential expression of CYP4A11 and CYP4F11
may be explained by differences in the enzymes substrates
(Supplementary Figure S5). CYP4A11 converts arachidonic acid
to metabolites that promote tumour growth and metastasis,
whereas CYP4F11 metabolises omega 3-fatty acids to eicosanoids
that inhibit tumour development and progression (Larsson et al,
2004; Kalsotra and Strobel, 2006; Dhar et al, 2008; Gelsomino et al,
2013; Barone et al, 2014). The differential expression of CYP4A11
and CYP4F11 was independently prognostic in multivariate
analysis using the main prognostic parameters and also when
only using information available at the time of biopsy diagnosis of
colorectal cancer. Therefore, this biomarker combination could be
a useful risk stratification tool especially if only tumour biopsies are
available at the time of initial treatment decisions, which is a likely
scenario considering colorectal cancer, especially rectal cancer, is
moving towards neoadjuvant therapy followed by either observa-
tional follow-up or salvage surgery (Garcia-Aguilar et al, 2015).
The expression of each enzyme based on MMR status was also
evaluated in this study, as this represents a major pathway in
colorectal cancer (Boland and Goel, 2010; Geiersbach and
Samowitz, 2011; Kim and Kim, 2014). Tumours lacking MMR
proteins are already considered a distinct subgroup when dealing
with prognosis and treatment of colorectal cancer (Hewish et al,
2010). Mismatch repair protein-proficient tumours represent the
majority of colorectal cancer cases with a significantly worse
prognosis than MMR-deficient tumours. Furthermore, novel
promising treatments such as those targeting immune checkpoints
have shown that MMR-proficient tumours are less responsive
compared with MMR-deficient tumours (Le et al, 2015). Therefore,
it is of particular interest to identify biomarkers for MMR-
proficient tumours. In this study, the differential expression of
CYP4A11 and CYP4F11 was significantly associated with prog-
nosis in MMR-proficient tumours and, more importantly, both
enzymes are actionable targets.
This study also found the expression of CYP4A11, CYP4F11 and
CYP4V2 were significantly reduced in lymph node metastasis
compared with their corresponding primary tumours. This provides
further evidence to the concept that the phenotype of cancer cells is
defined by their exposure to/and interaction with different micro-
environment factors during their migration and within the metastatic
site (Witz, 2008; Klein et al, 2012; Maman and Witz, 2013; Brown
and Murray, 2015). The interrelationship between cancer cells and
non-cancer cells within the microenvironment is increasingly
acknowledged as a major factor in determining and understanding
metastasis (McKay et al, 2000; Coghlin and Murray, 2010, 2014). The
variation in the phenotypic expression between primary and
metastatic tumours raises further doubts over the effectiveness of
existing metastatic treatment models that is based on phenotypic
assessment of primary tumour specimens.
In summary, CYP4A11, CYP4F11 and CYP4V2 are over-
expressed in colorectal cancer, the increased expression of
CYP4A11 is associated with poorer prognosis in both the total
patient cohort and in MMR-proficient tumours, whereas the
expression of CYP4F11 is associated with better outcome in MMR-
deficient tumours. The differential expression of CYP4A11 and
CYP4F11, which was independently prognostic in both the whole
patient cohort and in MMR-proficient tumours, could provide the
basis for a risk stratification tool in colorectal cancer. Furthermore,
both enzymes are actionable drug targets and therefore could have
therapeutic applications in colorectal cancer.
