Abstract: Morgellons disease (MD) is a skin condition characterized by the presence of 
multicolored filaments that lie under, are embedded in, or project from skin. Although the 
condition may have a longer history, disease matching the above description was first reported 
in the US in 2002. Since that time, the condition that we know as MD has become a polemic 
topic. Because individuals afflicted with the disease may have crawling or stinging sensations 
and sometimes believe they have an insect or parasite infestation, most medical practitioners 
consider MD a purely delusional disorder. Clinical studies supporting the hypothesis that MD 
is exclusively delusional in origin have considerable methodological flaws and often neglect 
the fact that mental disorders can result from underlying somatic illness. In contrast, rigorous 
experimental investigations show that this skin affliction results from a physiological response to 
the presence of an infectious agent. Recent studies from that point of view show an association 
between MD and spirochetal infection in humans, cattle, and dogs. These investigations have 
determined that the cutaneous filaments are not implanted textile fibers, but are composed of 
the cellular proteins keratin and collagen and result from overproduction of these filaments in 
response to spirochetal infection. Further studies of the genetics, pathogenesis, and treatment 
of MD are warranted.

Introduction
Morgellons disease (MD) is a disfiguring and perplexing skin condition associated with 
spirochetal infection and tick-borne illness.1–7 This poorly understood condition has a 
worldwide distribution, with estimated self-reported cases numbering over 14,000 in 
2009.5 Since that time, there has been an increasing number of individuals reported 
to be afflicted with this disorder (C Casey, Charles E Holman Morgellons Disease 
Foundation, personal communication, 2017). The distinguishing diagnostic feature of 
MD is spontaneously appearing ulcerative skin lesions that contain unusual filaments 
lying under, embedded in, or projecting from the skin. The characteristic filaments 
are microscopic, visually resembling textile fibers, and are white, black, or a more 
vibrant color, such as red or blue.1–7 In addition to fiber production, some patients may 
experience formication, described as stinging, biting, creeping and crawling sensations. 
The symptoms of MD are not limited to the skin. MD patients experience a variety 
of systemic manifestations, such as fatigue, joint pain, cardiac complications, cogni-
tive difficulties, and neuropathy, all symptoms that are commonly reported by Lyme 
disease (LD) patients.1–7

History
The name “Morgellons” (pronounced with either a hard or 
soft “g”) comes from a letter written in 1674 by Sir Thomas 
Browne, an English physician. The letter contains a brief 
description of a skin disease in French children:
Hairs which have most amused me have not been in the 
face or head, but on the back, and not in men but children, 
as I long ago observed in that endemial distemper of little 
children in Languedock, called the Morgellons, wherein 
they critically break out with harsh hairs on their backs, 
which takes off the unquiet symptoms of the disease, and 
delivers them from coughs and convulsions.8
Browne’s description of “the Morgellons” and other histori-
cal accounts of similar maladies date from 1544–1884 and 
were found in Browne’s library in 1935 by Kellett, who then 
summarized and discussed them.8
The accounts by Browne and others were likely referring 
to a heterogeneous group of skin conditions that may have 
differed from the skin condition that we refer to as MD today. 
These early accounts describe primarily childhood illnesses, 
many of which were associated with convulsions. There is 
mention of hairs, worms (with black protruding heads), or 
comedones that protruded from the skin, primarily on the 
arms, legs, and back, and at that time there was much debate 
as to whether these objects were animate or inanimate.8 
Ettmüller, for example, provided a drawing of infesting 
organisms that look like various arthropods, some resem-
bling scabies mites, while the famous Dutch microscopist 
Leuvenhoeck concluded that such objects were inanimate.8 
In 1894, Thibierge described patients who had erroneous 
and unshakeable beliefs of skin infestation by parasites, and 
proposed the name “acarophobia”.9,10 In 1946, Wilson and 
Miller suggested that “acarophobia” should be replaced by 
the name “delusions of parasitosis” (DOP).10,11
From 1902 to 1938, case studies describing “parasitopho-
bias” or “dermatological hypochondriasis” that resulted in 
delusional interpretation of skin sensations were published 
sporadically.12–20 However, as early as 1935, an association 
between spirochetal infection and DOP was documented by 
the French physician Vié, who reported that six of eight of the 
subjects in his case studies had syphilis.18 In 1938, a pivotal 
narrative of DOP was published by Ekbom, a series of case 
studies describing patients who had sensations of movement 
and the belief that insects were crawling on or under skin. 
Ekbom felt that determining the underlying cause of the 
formication was important, stating that “it is the underlying 
illness that determines the overall presentation of the beliefs” 
and “it is perhaps too simple that the parasitophobias should 
be considered as mental illness and nothing more”.20 Interest-
ingly, like Vié, Ekbom found that spirochetal infection was 
present in his patient cohort, and three of Ekbom’s seven 
patients had documented cases of syphilis. Despite the fact 
that syphilis was considered rare in Sweden, Ekbom did not 
believe that spirochetal infection was a contributing factor.20
Ekbom reported that the skin sensations consisted mostly 
of itching, but also that there was a feeling that something 
was crawling on or under the skin, and that stabbing and bit-
ing sensations could also occur. He mentioned that in such 
cases, “little animal” specimens were sometimes brought in 
by patients to show to physicians and that such collections 
consisted of “little hairs, little threads, grains of sand, and 
skin scales”. He noted that apart from delusional ideas of 
infestation, no consistent mental problems were present.20 
Although Ekbom could not find any arthropods, parasites, 
or other microscopic animals, it is important to note that he 
found hairs, “little threads”, and “grains of sand” in patient 
specimens. His description is consistent with the findings of 
unusual hairs, fibers, and hardened comedo-like dermatologi-
cal objects that we see in MD specimens.20 Such objects will 
be discussed in depth later in this report.
It is possible that patients in the case studies written by 
other physicians and mentioned by Ekbom had syphilis or 
other spirochetal infections. The causative agent of syphilis 
was first reported in 1905 by Fritz Schaudinn and Erich 
Hoffmann, who used dark-field microscopy and described 
spiral-shaped bacteria – Spirochaeta pallida – now called 
Treponema pallidum.21 The first test for syphilis was devel-
oped shortly afterward in 1906 by German physician and 
bacteriologist August von Wassermann. The Wassermann 
test was a complement-fixation test that detected antibodies 
reactive to the syphilis spirochete. The Wassermann tests 
performed in the 1920s and 1930s lacked accuracy,22,23 and 
cases of syphilis among patients with delusional parasitosis 
(DP) may have gone unacknowledged as a result.
Regardless of the test accuracy for syphilis, it is possible 
that some of the patients described in these historical case 
studies may have been infected with Borrelia spp., other 
treponemes or Leptospira spp. B. burgdorferi (Bb) is not 
a new organism: the earliest known case dates back 5,300 
years in the mummy dubbed Ötzi,24 and Borrelia DNA was 
also detected in two museum specimens of the white-footed 
mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, collected in 1894.25 Spiro-
chetes resembling Borrelia have also been found in amber-
fossilized ticks from 15–20 million years ago.26 Therefore, 
spirochetal infections associated with MD may have occurred

Morgellons disease
 
periodically hundreds or even thousands of years ago in 
human history, yet have gone unrecognized and unreported.
There is a brief mention of “the Morgellons” by Emslie-
Smith in 1946, where he proposes that the condition was a 
form of myiasis caused by the larva of a Hypoderma species, 
although his account did not provide convincing evidence 
to support his theory.27 In a 1983 lecture, Lyell described a 
survey of several hundred dermatologists treating patients 
with DOP who reported that many of their patients exhibited 
specimens in matchboxes, baggies, scraps of paper, or photo-
graphs. Lyell labeled this practice the “matchbox sign”.28 The 
survey was reported in a short editorial in the Lancet,10 after 
which the “matchbox sign” was adopted by dermatologists 
as being proof of delusional mental illness.29–31 Likewise, the 
manipulation of skin to extract specimens for relief was also 
considered to be proof of having a delusional disorder, and 
this practice was labeled “the tweezer sign”.29
After Emslie-Smith’s mention of MD in 1946, there 
were no significant references to MD in medical literature 
until 2002. In 2001, biologist Mary Leitao noted nonheal-
ing lesions on her young son, who complained that he had 
“bugs” under his skin. She removed a scab, and upon mag-
nification she did not see arthropods or parasites, but she 
did see embedded blue and red filaments. Leitao searched 
the Internet looking for similar conditions, and Browne’s 
description bore a resemblance to her son’s condition, so 
she appropriated the name.1,2 Leitao subsequently founded 
the not-for-profit Morgellons Research Foundation (MRF). 
The MRF website included a database where those with the 
disorder could self-report their skin and systemic symptoms.5
Leitao did not get answers from the mainstream medi-
cal establishment. She had sought help from many doctors, 
including Fred Heldrich, a Johns Hopkins pediatrician, who 
arrived at the conclusion that Leitao should not use her son 
to “explore the problem” and that she could benefit from a 
psychiatric evaluation.32 Leitao gathered a group of patient 
advocates, medical practitioners, physicians, and nurses into 
a volunteer board of directors, which included Georgia-based 
pediatrician Greg Smith, Texas-based nurse practitioner 
 
Virginia Savely, patient advocates Charles E Holman and 
Cindy Casey-Holman, and former National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration (NASA) physician and researcher 
William Harvey32 (C Casey, Charles E Holman Morgellons 
Disease Foundation, personal communication 2017). Leitao 
also sought help from Randy Wymore, a pharmacology pro-
fessor at Oklahoma State University.32
In 2006, Dan Rutz, a spokesman for the US Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) contacted Leitao 
and said that the CDC would form a task force to investi-
gate MD, declaring that “these people deserve more than to 
be blown off ”.32 The CDC published their study results in 
2012, declaring that MD was “similar to more commonly 
recognized conditions, such as delusional infestation [DI]”.33 
As of 2012, Leitao had withdrawn from the public eye and 
closed the MRF. The website run by the MRF is no longer 
active, and the domain name was taken over by others, now 
promoting fringe etiologic theories of MD.
Diagnosing MD
In light of previous studies of MD,1–7 a case definition for MD 
is proposed: a somatic LD-like illness associated with spon-
taneously appearing, slowly healing, filamentous, ulcerative 
skin lesions, with the key diagnostic criterion being colored, 
white, or black filaments protruding from or embedded in 
skin. Patients diagnosed with MD, either by self-diagnosis or 
by a health care practitioner, are not a homogeneous group, 
thus highlighting the need for a universally accepted case 
definition.
Filaments in MD lesions usually require magnification 
of 50× or more to be seen, and at that magnification they can 
be mistaken for textile fibers. Health care providers need to 
be objective when viewing these fibers: a patient must have 
unusual filaments visible under 50× magnification or higher 
(as opposed to the magnification of 10× normally used in 
dermatology) and embedded in or extruding from skin to 
be diagnosed with MD. The filaments are relatively easy 
to see with proper visualization tools, and detectable fibers 
should not be automatically dismissed as “self-implanted” 
or composed of synthetic substances without an appropriate 
evaluation. Mental health status is not a diagnostic factor in 
MD cases, as outlined herein.
Controversy
Unlike Ekbom, who was concerned about the underlying 
cause of DP
,8 many modern-day practitioners and scientists 
have ignored the potential underlying causes responsible for 
formication and beliefs of infestation. It is easier to declare 
mental illness the exclusive etiologic cause, thus blaming the 
patient, when confronted with perplexing symptoms that the 
practitioner cannot explain. However, it is irresponsible to 
label a patient delusional without an appropriate psychiatric 
evaluation, and if mental illness is present a physician should 
bear in mind that an underlying infectious process can cause 
a pathological response resulting in mental illness.
A PubMed search using the keyword “Morgellons” 
yielded 58 articles, the earliest dating from 1946. From 2006

to present, medical literature is divided into two polarized 
points of view. One point of view is that MD is a form of 
delusional mental illness, and the other is that underlying 
spirochetal infection causes a filamentous dermopathy that is 
accompanied by an array of LD-like multisystem symptoms 
that may or may not include neuropsychiatric symptoms. 
There are approximately 40 papers in the medical literature 
proposing that MD is purely a delusional disorder, and only 
a quarter of that figure proposing that MD has an infectious 
etiology.
Diagnosing delusional disorder
The American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Sta-
tistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-V makes no men-
tion of a diagnosis of DOP
. The closest diagnosis is Delusional 
disorder 297.1 (F22), somatic type, which is defined thus:
•  
presence of one or more delusions with a duration of 
one month or longer
•  
criteria for schizophrenia have never been met (note 
hallucinations if present are not prominent and are 
related to the delusional theme eg, the sensation of 
being infected with insects is associated with delusions 
of infestation)
•  
apart from the impact of the delusion(s) or its rami-
fications, functioning is not markedly impaired, and 
behavior is not obviously bizarre or odd
•  
if manic or major depressive episodes have occurred, 
these have been brief relative to the duration of the 
delusional periods
•  
the disturbance is not better explained by another mental 
disorder, such as obsessive compulsive disorder, and is 
not due to the physiological effects of a substance or 
medication or another medical condition.34
Somatic-type delusional disorders manifest with core beliefs 
concerning bodily functions or sensations. Manschreck 
stated that the diagnosis of delusional disorder should be a 
diagnosis of exclusion, and he outlined three steps for evalu-
ating patients with delusions. The first step is to establish if 
pathology is present. This step requires clinical judgment to 
distinguish among a true observation, a firm belief, an over-
valued idea, and a delusion.35 He states that a comment that 
at first appears delusional can prove to be factual, and some 
reports that seem believable may later be found to be delu-
sional. Therefore, he recommended that rather than the truth 
or falseness of a belief, the extremeness or inappropriateness 
of a patient’s behavior may be the determining factor leading 
to a diagnosis of delusional disorder.35,36 In other words, one 
must first establish that a belief is delusional, and not the 
result of an underlying somatic illness.
The second step involves determining if characteristics 
associated with delusions, such as confusion, agitation, per-
ceptual disturbances, physical symptoms, and mood abnor-
malities are present.35 The third step is performing a systematic 
differential diagnosis, including a thorough history, mental 
status examination, and laboratory/radiological evaluation to 
rule out other medical and psychiatric conditions that present 
with delusions.35 The status examination, including cognitive 
status, is usually normal, except for the delusional beliefs: 
memory and cognition are intact.37 Auditory or visual hal-
lucinations are indicative of more severe psychotic disorders, 
such as schizophrenia, and suggest exclusion of a delusional 
disorder.37 The differential diagnosis should exclude medical 
conditions that can cause delusions, such as neurodegen-
erative or other central nervous system disorders, vascular 
diseases, vitamin deficiencies, medications, metabolic and 
endocrine disorders, toxins, and infectious diseases.37 Note 
that spirochetal infections such as syphilis and LD could cause 
symptoms that fall into this category.
Evidence supporting the hypothesis 
of DP
Among reports that promote a delusional etiology for MD, 
there are a number of review articles, opinion pieces, or edito-
rial letters.29,30,38–53 These do not provide any new research or 
clinical evidence to support the claims that MD is a delusional 
disorder, but they do present common discussion themes 
that are frequently reiterated in case studies and research 
papers.54–76 Common discussion themes are:
• MD is a delusional disorder29,30,38–76
• MD is a variation of DOP
, DP
, or DI29,30,38–76
• MD is defined as the fixed, unshakable belief, despite lack 
of medical evidence, of being infested with microscopic 
organisms or inanimate objects29,30,38–76
• the presentation of specimens in or out of a container, 
whether it be a matchbox, small plastic bag, paper, pill 
container, or photographic image, etc, is diagnostic of 
DOP
, DP
, or DI29–31,52,55,59–62,64,66,70,71
• patients with MD tend to have psychiatric comorbidities74,68
• MD is a mass delusional mental illness afflicting primarily 
middle-aged Caucasian females68,69,74,76
• delusions of infestation are spread from person to person 
and transmitted by the Internet30,39,41,51,52,54,58,60
• antipsychotic drugs are the treatment of choice for 
MD29,30,38–62,64–76

Morgellons disease
• electroconvulsive therapy is an acceptable treatment for 
MD30,52
• establishing rapport to gain confidence and trust helps 
convince patients to take antipsychotic drugs30,39,41,49,54,58,60
• using the word “Morgellons” in dialogue with patients 
can help establish rapport and trust30,39,41,54,58,60
• it is acceptable for dermatologists to diagnose delusional 
disorder and prescribe antipsychotic medication51,56
• use of deceptive dialogue and strategies aimed at convinc-
ing patients to take antipsychotic drugs is a justifiable 
practice41,50,54,60,65
• if a patient’s friend(s) or family member(s) also observe a 
subject’s dermatological lesions and believe the evidence, 
then they too are considered to share the delusional belief, 
and the delusion is considered to have been transmitted 
from one individual to another;30,51,54,68 the belief shared 
by two people that there are organisms present in the skin 
is called folie à deux (madness of two); folie à trois, folie 
à quatre, or folie à cinq are shared beliefs by three, four, 
or five people, respectively; and shared belief in a family 
is folie à famille.30,51,54,68
A PubMed search using the keyword “Morgellons” iden-
tified 18 publications consisting of case studies of between 
one and six patients. Table 1 provides a summary of the case 
studies. Most of these patients clearly do not meet the case 
definition of MD. Case studies provide useful anecdotal 
evidence, but they have limitations. Of these case studies, 
the majority do not mention the observation of fibers being 
present in or projecting from the skin (the key defining cri-
terion for MD), nor do they mention whether the attending 
health care professional looked for filaments in the skin at 
magnification of 50× or higher.54–56,59–68,70,73
Some studies reported that patients presented specimens 
to the health care provider as evidence – fibers, lint, hair and 
skin scrapings, etc – and this was interpreted as being diag-
nostic of DI.55,59–62,64,66,70,71 In many of these case studies, there 
was no mention of any analysis of patient-supplied specimens 
to determine composition.54,59,60 In a few cases, the health care 
provider did nothing more than a gross visual identification 
of patient-provided specimens.55,62,66,70,71 Some studies did not 
mention fibers associated with their cases at all.55,58,60 Only 
seven of these studies indicated that the subjects had heard 
of MD.54,56,58,61–63,70
In some case studies, a patient was diagnosed with DP 
or DI on very little evidence. Bhandary et al diagnosed DP 
in patients who felt crawling sensations and thus thought 
they had bugs in their ears or nose.55 Such conditions as 
seborrheic dermatitis or eczema can cause formication and 
crawling sensations inside the ears and nose, and should 
be ruled out before diagnosing mental illness. Sandhu and 
Steele diagnosed a patient with DI because the patient felt 
as though she had fibers growing into her eye. The patient 
had ectropion, and perhaps this was a factor contributing to 
the uncomfortable sensations.73 In these cases, underlying 
causes for sensations were not thoroughly investigated before 
assuming the patient was having sensory hallucinations. 
Furthermore, given the sensations of formication, the beliefs 
in bugs in the first cases and of fibers in the second case are 
not unreasonable or inappropriate.
In cases where a health care professional did not look 
for filaments, it is unclear whether or not patients with MD 
were in these studies. Some studies did not mention if the 
patient had lesions.54 Some reports mentioned lesions or 
skin abnormalities, but did not describe examination with 
magnification of 50× or higher for fibers in or projecting 
from skin.56,58–60,62–67,70,73 Other studies mentioned that the skin 
was completely normal and that no skin abnormalities were 
present; therefore, it is very unlikely that patients in these 
studies actually had MD, as they did not have the diagnostic 
clinical finding.55,61,65,71,75
There are only three case studies that specifically mention 
the presence of fibers either projecting from or embedded in 
skin.57,72,75 Roncati et al72 reported “grayish spots” under skin, 
then used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-
dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to study the spots. SEM showed 
that the spots were associated with fibers described as “synthetic 
wire” consistent with samples from a washing machine, as well 
as keratin fibers consistent with hair from the patient’
s dog. 
The EDS analysis detected carbon, sulfur, and oxygen peaks 
– elements for keratin – but EDS could not reveal what type of 
keratin it was. Therefore, the “synthetic wire” could have been 
keratin filaments from the patient. The authors concluded that 
the keratin hairs were of canine origin, based on morphologi-
cal resemblance to the patient’
s dog hair, yet they provided no 
further proof of this conclusion. As some MD fibers are small 
hairs, determining whether the hairs are human or canine in 
origin is important. SEM shows only the outer shape of a speci-
men, so the scaling pattern is the only morphological feature 
available for comparison, and the imbricate scaling of canine 
and human hair is quite similar (TA Evans, TRI Princeton, 
personal communication, September 13, 2017). EDS analysis 
can only tell the chemical composition of the specimen and 
again, human and canine hair would be similar.77
Ohn et al saw only one black fiber protruding from the 
skin, and then claimed that this single fiber was lost during

Middelveen et al
processing for histological examination.75 Therefore, one can-
not draw any conclusions about the composition or origin of 
this fiber. Dovigi provided convincing evidence that the fibers 
extracted from an oral lesion on the mucosal distal tuberos-
ity of a tooth were synthetic carbon-based fibers, but there 
is no evidence that the fibers were self-implanted.57 Dental 
floss is composed of synthetic fibers, such as nylon.78 Fibers 
could have been introduced during flossing, especially if the 
floss had frayed and become lodged between teeth, eventu-
ally festering and causing a lesion. Belief that the fibers had 
originated in the tissue would be reasonable under those 
circumstances.
The case studies varied in terms of looking for pathogens, 
but on further examination all of the studies fall short in 
looking for spirochetal infection. Only two of the case studies 
looked for Borrelia infection, and neither of these performed 
a thorough laboratory analysis to search for spirochetes.72,75 
The description of testing for Borrelia in these studies is not 
sufficiently detailed to know what was actually done. In sci-
ence, reproducibility is important, and methodologies should 
provide enough details that others can repeat them. Roncati et 
al stated: “In adjunct, the patient had noticed an increase in 
the viscosity of mucus, saliva, and tears, as to produce four 
unexplainable corneal ulcers in the last two years, without a 
rise in the autoimmunity or Borrelia spp. serology”.72 There 
is no mention of whether or not the Borrelia spp. serology 
was interpreted as being positive or negative, what species 
or type of Borrelia antigens were used, what laboratory the 
serology was performed at, or what method was used to detect 
the antibodies. Furthermore, although the patient had a few 
gray spots containing fibers, there was no evidence they were 
self-implanted or related to a delusional belief. Therefore, the 
study cannot disprove an infectious etiology for MD.
The study by Ohn et al is no better in terms of providing 
methodology.75 In fact, the methodology in the abstract does 
not match the text. While the abstract states that polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) testing for Bb was negative in serum, 
the text states that Bb serology was negative. It is thus unclear 
whether serology or PCR testing was used to diagnose Bb.75 
There is mention that a Warthin–Starry stain was performed, 
and histological examination revealed only a mild lympho-
cytic infiltration. However, because Bb is pleomorphic, such 
stains can be difficult to interpret, and mild lymphocytic infil-
tration is precisely what one would expect in Bb skin lesions, 
such as erythema migrans (EM) rash sites.79 Studies that do 
mention the search for and identification of pathogens other 
than Borrelia spp. are sadly lacking. The methodology in the 
study by Altunay et al mentioned “l 
aboratory  
investigations 
including routine biochemical analyses of the blood and 
urine, cutaneous biopsy, the microscobic [sic] analysis of 
so-called parasites or materials emerging from the skin”.66 
DeBonis and Pierre described their microbiological method-
ology as “Evaluation by a primary care physician revealed 
no signs of infection”.61
Many studies included cases that did not meet the 
DSM-V criterion for delusional disorder. Some studies 
featured patients who were clearly delusional and had or 
likely had serious underlying psychiatric illnesses, such as 
 
schizophrenia.62,66 Some described conditions that clearly 
indicated the patient had disease affecting the central nervous 
system: Roncati et al indicated the patient in their case study 
had “myoclonies” [sic], which presumably means seizures or 
muscle twitches; one patient in the study by Fellner et al had 
senile dementia; and the patient in the report of Freudenreich 
et al had HIV infection.58,67,72 Some studies included cases 
where so-called delusional disorders could have had cultural 
influences.55,66 Some studies mentioned underlying medical 
conditions that may have caused psychiatric disturbance. 
In the study by Altunay et al, five patients had vitamin B12 
deficiency and one had thyroid disease in addition to vitamin 
B12 deficiency.66 In the study by Reid and Lio, one patient 
had diabetes mellitus.60 Patients in other studies were using 
psychoactive drugs.56,61,62,67,70 The patient in the case study by 
Roncati et al had hepatitis C virus infection.72
A few case studies claimed that treatment with antipsy-
chotic medication was curative.55,59,60,66 In contrast, many 
more case studies indicated that treatment with antipsychotic 
drugs reduced symptoms but was not curative55,58,61,66,70,71 or 
that antipsychotics were ineffective.62,63,65 In fact, Robles et al 
suggested that treatment with antibiotics was more success-
ful than treatment with antipsychotics, although they too 
concluded that MD was delusional rather than infectious. 
They reported that treatment of two patients with doxycycline 
and no antipsychotics resulted in complete resolution of the 
condition, while one subject treated with antipsychotics and 
no antibiotics did not have disease resolution.65 Some studies 
indicated that antipsychotic drugs were prescribed, but failed 
to report if treatment was effective,54,55,64,75 and Roncati et 
al failed to report what (if any) treatment was prescribed.72 
Some of the studies reporting cure or benefit with antipsy-
chotic drugs used other treatment methods in addition to the 
antipsychotic medication, and without controls one cannot 
be sure which variable was responsible for the patient’s 
improvement.55,62,66,67,73
There were only five reports of studies involving larger 
cohorts of patients.33,68,69,74,76 Four of these were retrospective

studies,68,69,74,76 and the remaining study selected its cohort by 
conducting a retrospective search through medical records.33 
Retrospective studies are limited, because data may be 
incomplete and cases may lack laboratory analysis or proper 
documentation. The retrospective study by Mohandas et al74 
included 35 patients and made no mention of the presence 
of fibers. The study reported female predominance, with a 
mean age of 54.6 years. Psychiatric comorbidities (anxiety 
and depression) were noted in 68.5%, and management of 
patients included treatment with psychotropic medications 
combined with topical and oral antibiotics. Improvement was 
reported in less than half of the cohort (40%), and all four 
patients who received low-dose oral antibiotic therapy noted 
 
improvement.74 The study by Hylwa et al from the Mayo 
Clinic was a retrospective study of psychiatric comorbidity 
in a cohort of 54 patients diagnosed with DI. Comorbidities 
were found in 74% of these patients, and there was no mention 
of fiber or pathogen detection in the retrospective report.69
Foster et al also conducted a retrospective study of DI 
at the Mayo Clinic.68 Medical records of 147 patients were 
reviewed to determine demographic information, historical 
and physical findings, and treatment. In this cohort, 81% 
had a history of one or more psychiatric illnesses (the most 
common diagnosis being depression), 11% had a history of 
drug use (methamphetamines, cocaine, heroin, marijuana, 
and other street drugs) that may have contributed to their 
symptoms, and only 20% of subjects reported having fibers 
in their skin, and thus the cohort was composed predomi-
nantly of non-MD subjects. The study lacked fiber analysis, 
and there was no mention that any skin-associated fibers 
had been visualized by the investigators, so it is possible 
that there were no subjects in the study meeting the key 
diagnostic MD criterion. Methodology for detecting any 
pathogens was lacking, and there was no mention of detec-
tion of Borrelia or other tick-borne pathogens at all. Nev-
ertheless, the authors stated that they did not find evidence 
of infestation in patient-provided specimens, biopsies, or 
tests for ova and parasites.68
The CDC–Kaiser Permanente Northern California–
Armed Forces Institute of Pathology collaborative study 
(CDC study) selected their cohort via a retrospective search 
through medical records.33 This study had significant flaws. 
The case definition did not require the presence of fibers 
embedded in or projecting from skin; therefore, selection 
was on the basis of self-reported cases, and resulted in a 
heterogeneous group of subjects. Eligibility to participate 
in the study was limited to those enrolled in a Kaiser Per-
manente plan. The number of participants diminished as the 
study progressed: whereas 467 subjects were identified by a 
search of Kaiser Permanente electronic records, cultures for 
pathogens were conducted on only 28 subjects, and fibers 
were collected from only 12 subjects.33 Fiber analysis was 
performed and cotton-textile fibers identified, but the authors 
admitted they did not find fibers that were embedded or 
projecting from skin, and they admitted that they may have 
introduced cotton fibers at the time of sampling. Two of the 
subjects identified in the electronic search died, and the cause 
of death was not disclosed.
Objective findings of illness that could have accounted for 
the symptoms were ignored: cognitive impairment, somatic 
complaints, neuropsychiatric symptoms, multiorgan symp-
toms, and the presence of inflammatory  
markers.33,80 Cases 
with these findings do not meet the DSM-V criteria for 
delusional disorder. Most importantly, although the authors 
acknowledged that the literature had suggested an associa-
tion between MD and LD, they did not perform any specific 
detection methods, such as Borrelia culture or immunohis-
tochemical staining, for any Borrelia spp., and the search for 
LD was limited to insensitive serologic testing. In conclusion, 
they used a flawed case definition, selected the wrong cohort, 
selected the wrong specimens, performed the wrong tests, 
and came to incorrect conclusions with respect to MD and 
the association with LD.33,80
Evidence of an infectious etiology
Early history
In modern times, spirochetal infection was implicated as 
an etiologic factor for MD as early as 2006, when William 
Harvey, a former medical director of a laboratory contracted 
to work for NASA, explained to a medical reporter, Chico 
Harlan with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, that he had been 
studying a group of 70 MD patients, all of whom were 
infected with Bb, the causative agent of LD.32 Savely et al 
in 2006 reported that the principal author, nurse practitioner 
Virginia Savely, had seen 80 patients in her practice who 
fit the criteria for MD, and all but one of these patients had 
tested positive for LD.2
A subsequent study by Harvey et al attempted to delin-
eate MD characteristics in a cohort of 25 self-diagnosed 
MD patients.81 Although these patients apparently met the 
case definition for DP
, the authors felt the cause and effect 
of the symptoms were reversed from those of DP, and 
they suggested that an infectious process was responsible 
for the development of symptoms. They reported that the 
male:female ratio was approximately equal, that 23 of 25 
subjects had prior psychiatric diagnoses, around 50% had

Middelveen et al
sensations of movement, 70% had excoriations or lesions, and 
that fibers were present in about a third of patients.81 Central 
nervous system symptoms, cardiac symptoms, endocrine 
dysfunction (hyperparathyroidism, adrenocortical hypofunc-
tion, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, hypercalcemia, elevated fasting 
insulin levels, and parathyroid adenomas), a high rate of 
autoimmune disease, and low core body temperature were 
commonly encountered in their cohort. Laboratory evidence 
of abnormalities that were commonly encountered included 
anemia, leukopenia, high monocyte count, low natural-killer 
cells, elevated serum calcium, elevated globulin levels, and 
elevated inflammatory markers (CRP
, TNFα, IFNγ). Skin 
abnormalities included excoriations, angiomas, and filament/
granule production. The need for a credible MD case defini-
tion was emphasized.81
Savely and Stricker analyzed clinical findings in a cohort 
of 122 subjects with documented presence of unusual fila-
ments projecting from or embedded in skin.4 The key objec-
tive of this study was to develop a credible case definition for 
MD, and because cutaneous fibers were the unique objective 
finding, the presence of such fibers was determined to be an 
obligatory part of the case definition. The link between MD 
and LD was explored, and the study reported that 96.8% 
of subjects had either positive LD tests by Western blot or 
clinical diagnoses of LD; many had positive tests for coin-
fecting tick-borne illnesses, and the demographics of the 
LD patients and MD patients in their practices proved to be 
similar. Other important findings in the cohort group were 
female predominance and hypothyroidism.4
Middelveen and Stricker provided evidence of spiro-
chetal involvement in the evolution of MD.6 MD was com-
pared to bovine digital dermatitis (BDD), a disease in cattle 
caused by various species of treponemes. Several similari-
ties between MD and BDD were noted, including unusual 
filament formation, female predominance, rapid spread, 
exposure to unsanitary conditions or humid environments, 
and positive response to antibiotics. The fact that spirochetes 
caused unusual filament formation in cattle suggested that 
a similar mechanism might occur in MD patients. The fact 
that spirochetes were visible in BDD histological sections 
suggested that spirochetes might be present in MD tissue 
as well.6
Fiber analysis
Histological studies have shown that filaments in MD tissue 
are not textile fibers, but are biofilaments produced by human 
epithelial cells and stemming from deeper epidermal layers, 
upper dermal layers, and the root sheath of hair follicles 
(Figure 1).7,82,83 MD cutaneous filaments are  
predominantly 
 
composed of keratin and collagen, as determined by histo-
logical studies, and appear to be produced by activated kera-
tinocytes and fibroblasts.82,83 The base of filament attachment 
to epithelial cells demonstrates nucleation that is continuous 
with that of surrounding epithelial cells, indicating that the 
filaments are of human cellular origin (Figure 2).83 Histo-
chemical staining of skin sections containing embedded 
filaments with Congo red resulted in apple-green birefrin-
gence suggestive of an amyloid component, although this 
remains to be confirmed using more specific methodologies.7 
Calcofluor-white staining of skin sections with embedded 
filaments was negative, and thus MD filaments do not have 
any cellulose content from plant fibers, such as cotton, or 
chitin from fungal cells or insect exoskeletons.7

Morgellons disease
Several independent studies have shown that blue MD 
fibers were human hairs or hairlike extrusions and that blue 
coloration resulted from melanin pigmentation (Figure 3). 
Blue textile fibers are colored by dyes, not by blue melanin 
pigmentation; therefore, it is not possible that blue MD fibers 
are textile in origin. MD filaments are hairlike extrusions, and 
some MD fibers are very fine human hairs.7,82,83 The coloration 
of blue fibers was shown to result from melanin pigmentation, 
which was demonstrated by positive histochemical staining 
with Fontana Masson. A confirmatory study performed at a 
laboratory specializing in biofibers and coloration established 
that embedded blue fibers in MD dermatological specimens 
were human hairs.
SEM of blue MD fibers shows cuticular scaling consistent 
with human hairs, and transmission electron microscopy 
shows darkly stained, disorganized melanosomes consistent 
with human hairs.7,83 Microspectrophotometry reflectance of 
blue fibers is consistent with that of pigmented tissues, and 
Raman spectroscopy results in relevant peaks corresponding 
to carbamate compounds and melanin aromatic rings (MD 
Shawkey, University of Akron, personal communication, 
2013).7 An investigation concluded that fibers were not self-
implanted, due to the fact that they were deeply embedded in 
skin in a manner that a patient would not be able to achieve 
(MD Shawkey, University of Akron, personal communica-
tion, 2013).
Other MD findings
If MD specimens are examined, they demonstrate evidence 
of abnormal keratin and collagen expression. In addition to 
the formation of abnormal cutaneous fibers, many patients 
report changes to hair and fingernails.82 Deformed follicular 
bulbs, pili multigemini (formation of multiple hair shafts 
within individual follicles), filamentous projections from the 
follicular sheath surrounding hair bulbs, and the formation of 
thickened keratin projections are common findings.82,83 The 
authors of this paper have had the opportunity to examine 
many MD lesions and MD dermatological specimens (Fesler, 
Middelveen, and Stricker, unpublished data, 2017). We have 
noted that MD lesions can begin as folliculitis that evolves 
into ulcerative filamentous lesions, with further evidence 
of keratin and collagen abnormalities, such as formation 
of keratin projections, formation of hardened comedo-like 
masses, and deformities of hairs and hair follicles, as men-
tioned previously.
Keratin projections are thickened follicular casts. When 
sectioned and stained with Gömöri trichrome, these fol-
licular casts are abnormal in that although the outer surface 
is composed of keratin-rich tissue, the interior can contain 
collagen-rich tissue. Comedo-like masses can emerge from 
pores spontaneously or when scratched, and are sometimes 
described by patients as being sand-like. Patients may misin-
terpret these objects as being seeds, eggs, cocoons, parasites, 
or even arthropods. These comedo-like masses can contain 
embedded keratin or collagen filaments and/or projecting 
filaments. When they form inside a pore or follicle, they may 
form a tight wad of fibers (Figure 4A). Hair and follicular 
bulb deformities include pili multigemini (mentioned previ-
ously) (Figure 4B), hairs or fibers growing downward deep 
into the dermis rather than in the opposite direction through 
the pore opening, and follicular sheaths with filamentous pro-
jections. These projections can completely cover the follicular 
sheath, and may be interpreted as caterpillars by patients.
Contaminating extraneous artifacts can complicate 
identification of legitimate dermatological findings in MD. 
We have found pollen, noninfesting arthropods, feathers, 
and mites in patient-supplied specimens. Some patients 
have described the production of “fuzzballs”. We performed 
histological sectioning and staining with Gömöri trichrome 
on such artifacts and determined the “fuzzballs” in patient-
supplied samples that we studied were largely composed of 
textile fibers, but did have some keratin fibers or keratinized 
tissue present as well. We speculate that such artifacts may 
include keratin-containing material related to MD, but that 
textile fibers can attach to sticky exudate or can tangle into 
filamentous lesions. Other patients have described hexagonal 
crystals and “glitter” in MD skin. Spectroscopic analysis of 
the hexagonal crystals proved that they were contaminating 
man-made hexagonal objects (of the type used in cosmetics

and greeting cards) with either cellulose or plastic centers 
and a metallic coating (V Loyd, Mount Allison University, 
personal communication, 2017). The “glitter” that we studied 
contained salts that were likely human bioproducts, and may 
have a role in MD (unpublished data). As extraneous artifacts 
can contaminate sticky lesions, it is important to collect 
only fibers deeply embedded in skin or clearly projecting 
in a hair-like manner for studies intended to determine fiber 
composition.
As mentioned earlier in the report, cattle with BDD form 
lesions that produce unusual keratin projections. Although 
visually different from the small slender filaments in MD 
lesions, we have also observed slender fibers in BDD 
specimens that strongly resemble the fibers in human MD 
(Figure 5) (unpublished observation).
Detection of pathogens
Early on in MD history, a link between MD and LD was 
reported.1–7 Savely and Stricker reported that 96.8% of their 
cohort of 122 MD patients had either positive LD serology or 
an LD diagnosis.4 A more recent study reported that 6% of LD 
patients in a cohort of Australian LD subjects had MD,84 and 
Borrelia spirochetes have repeatedly been detected in skin 
and bodily fluid specimens from MD subjects. Preliminary 
studies reported that Bb sensu stricto (Bbss) spirochetes were 
detected in dermatological tissue removed from MD lesions 
of four North American patients,83,85 and an ensuing study 
reported the detection of Borrelia garinii in MD samples 
from an Australian patient.86
A larger study was needed to verify the association 
between Borrelia infection and MD. Consequently, a study 
of 25 North American MD patients confirmed the pres-
ence of Borrelia spirochetes in MD-tissue and body-fluid 
specimens, both directly in dermatological specimens and in 
cultures obtained from MD patients using microscopic, histo-
pathological, and molecular detection methods.87 This study 
provided evidence for the presence of Borrelia DNA in MD 
specimens by PCR followed by DNA sequencing performed 
by two independent laboratories. PCR technology ampli-
fied Borrelia DNA in 13 MD whole-callus specimens (nine 
sequenced), four cultures inoculated with dermatological 
tissue (one sequenced), eight blood cultures (two sequenced), 
two vaginal secretion cultures (both sequenced), and one 
intestinal specimen. The Borrelia spirochetes detected in 
these studies were identified primarily as Bbss, but B. garinii 
and B. miyamotoi were also reported.87
The fact that motile spirochetes identified as Borrelia spp. 
were detected in Barbour–Stoenner–Kelly H medium inocu-
lated with MD dermatological tissue proves that spirochetes 
present in MD tissue are viable.85,87 Identification of Borrelia 
spirochetes in cultures is complicated by fastidious growth 
requirements and pleomorphism,88,89 but PCR amplification 
of cultured spirochetes in these studies provided confirmatory 
molecular identification of live Borrelia spirochetes in speci-
mens from MD subjects.87 Four laboratories independently 
confirmed the presence of Borrelia DNA in MD specimens 
using PCR technology and confirmatory DNA sequencing.7 
Recently, independent researchers from Canada using PCR 
technology and confirmatory DNA sequencing have detected 
Borrelia DNA in cultures inoculated with specimens from 
MD patients (J Lewis, V Lloyd, Mount Allison University, 
personal communication, 2017). Therefore, five laboratories 
using PCR technology have now provided confirmation of 
Borrelia DNA in MD specimens, including four species of 
Borrelia: Bbss, B. garinii, B. hermsii, and B. miyamotoi7,90,91(J 
Lewis, V Lloyd, Mount Allison University, personal com-
munication, 2017). The detection of Borrelia spirochetes is 
reproducible, providing that correct methods of detection are 
employed (Figure 6).
Borrelia spirochetes can invade and replicate inside 
fibroblasts and keratinocytes,92–94 and have been isolated in 
vitro from monolayers of keratinocytes and fibroblasts despite 
antibiotic treatment.92,93 Sequestration in these cells may be a 
contributing factor in the development of refractory  
infection

Morgellons disease
in MD patients. In support of that hypothesis, Borrelia 
spirochetes were detected in MD skin specimens removed 
from patients treated with aggressive antibiotic therapy.87 
Hypothetically, intracellular infection of keratinocytes and 
fibroblasts would be able to alter keratin and collagen gene 
expression, respectively, resulting in unusual filament forma-
tion.7 Some patients report that gel was secreted from their 
skin. We sectioned these dried-gel secretions, and immunos-
taining targeted to Borrelia was positive and demonstrated a 
copious quantity of well-formed spirochetes embedded in a 
clear matrix. This finding is consistent with biofilm formation 
(unpublished data). The spirochetal load in MD specimens 
is high and suggests biofilm formation in vivo.85,87 The for-
mation of biofilms may also contribute to the severity of the 
dermopathy and antibiotic resistance.
The key etiologic factor contributing to the evolution 
of MD lesions seems to be infection with Borrelia spp., 
the pathogen most consistently detected in MD patients.

However, we speculate that the etiology of MD is multifacto-
rial. Factors such as genetic predisposition, endocrine influ-
ences, immune status, and the presence of other infections, 
particularly tick-borne coinfections, appear to play a role 
in the development of this phenomenon.1–7 Pathogens other 
than Borrelia spp. have been detected in MD tissue samples, 
including Helicobacter pylori, Treponema denticola, and 
Bartonella henselae.87,90,91,95 Preliminary genetic studies have 
demonstrated nine genes with significant sequence variation 
in MD patients (E Sapi, University of New Haven, unpub-
lished observation, 2017). Examination of genetic factors 
that contribute to MD is currently in progress.
Recently, MD-like filamentous dermatitis was described 
in domestic dogs, and Bbss was detected by PCR amplifica-
tion confirmed by DNA sequencing, thus providing evidence 
that MD-like filamentous dermatitis may be associated with 
LD in these dogs.96 Interestingly, many of these dogs were 
bulldogs or other breeds with color-dilution genes, thus sug-
gesting that genetics may predispose certain breeds of dogs 
infected with Borrelia to develop this skin condition. Many of 
the owners of these pets had no prior knowledge of MD, and 
thus these were not cases of delusion by proxy.96 The fact that 
a condition analogous to MD in humans can occur in dogs 
and a similar animal model of spirochetal infection associated 
with filament formation – BDD – occurs in cattle provides 
supportive evidence that MD is an infectious process.
Antibiotic treatment of MD
Although there is anecdotal evidence that MD responds to 
antibiotics,1–7 controlled studies of MD treatment with anti-
biotics have not been conducted. Optimal treatment for MD 
remains undetermined. Two of the authors report success in 
treating LD/MD patients with antibiotics. In general, early 
treatment contributes to a better patient outcome. Treatment 
aimed at the underlying tick-borne disease is essential to 
resolve MD dermopathy, and treatment may require both 
prolonged combination-antibiotic therapy and the identifi-
cation and treatment of any coinfecting tick-borne diseases 
or other exacerbating factors. Some patients benefit from 
antiparasitic therapy, although there appears to be no direct 
evidence of parasite infection in MD.
Clinical classification of MD
A clinical classification scheme has been proposed for MD:
1. early localized: lesions/fibers present for less than 3 
months and localized to one area of the body (head, trunk, 
extremities)
2. early disseminated: lesions/fibers present for less than 
3 months and involving more than one area of the body 
(head, trunk, extremities)
3. late localized: lesions/fibers present for more than 6 
months and localized to one area of the body (head, trunk, 
extremities)
4. late disseminated: lesions/fibers present for more than 
6 months and involving more than one area of the body 
(head, trunk, extremities).
This classification scheme centers on the duration and loca-
tion of MD lesions with the intent to validate and standardize 
the diagnosis of MD.7,87
Discussion
The diagnosis of Delusional disorder 297.1 (F22), somatic 
type, as described in the DSM-V
, requires clinical judgment, as 
the delusional belief should not be better explained by another 
mental disorder, be caused by the effects of a substance or 
medication, nor caused by other medical conditions, such as 
infection. Many of the case studies cited in this paper mention-
ing MD concern patients who have medical conditions such 
as diabetes, vitamin B12 deficiency, substance-abuse problems, 
and infections that could be implicated in the development of 
their symptoms, and diagnosing such patients with delusional 
disorder is contrary to DSM-V principles. The diagnosis of 
a delusional disorder is best made by a professional with 
mental health training, such as a psychiatrist. Single, isolated 
delusions are quite rare, and truly delusional patients have 
evidence of other delusions, not just DOP
.
There is significant overlap in the array of symptoms 
that may accompany LD, MD, and mental illness, thus 
complicating the diagnosis. In theory, patients who do not

have MD but who are delusional could think they have MD 
if they have had exposure to the topic through the Internet 
or other means.7,87 To complicate the diagnosis further, 
MD patients may exhibit neuropsychiatric symptoms, and 
many have psychiatric diagnoses, such as bipolar disorder, 
attention-deficit disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, 
and schizophrenia.1,7,81 Therefore, many MD patients may 
have psychiatric comorbidities, and in some cases, patients 
have been misdiagnosed with a psychiatric illness that they 
do not have.7 Some MD patients may have false beliefs that 
are not delusional in origin. Lack of scientific knowledge can 
cause patients to misinterpret symptoms, such as the pres-
ence of filaments and sensations of formication as worms, 
arthropods, or other infestations. In addition, MD lesions 
are sticky and arthropods or artifacts can adhere to exudate, 
and patients may incorrectly believe these external factors 
are associated with the dermopathy.7,87
A patient who (because of symptom misinterpretation or 
lack of scientific knowledge) believes he or she has a parasitic 
infestation should not be diagnosed with delusional mental 
illness. It is logical for a patient to speculate that a complex 
of symptoms, including abnormal skin fibers coupled with 
formication, could be caused by a parasite. Furthermore, 
patients with MD are not always aware that they have 
filaments, because magnification is needed to visualize the 
filaments and many are diagnosed with other conditions, 
such as lichen sclerosus or prurigo nodularis, which lack 
filament formation.7,87 In addition, systemic LD is commonly 
associated with dermatological conditions and neurological 
symptoms, such as paresthesias.7,87,97,98 As such, multiorgan 
MD symptoms overlap with LD because MD is associated 
with LD, and this dermatological and neurological symptom 
overlap may partly explain the odd movement or stinging 
sensations that MD patients experience.
The DSM-V does not mention DOP
, DI, or DP
. In the 
case of Delusional disorder 297.1 (F22), delusions are not 
the beliefs themselves, but the way they are interpreted by 
patients. Delusions are profound, intensely held beliefs that 
seem barely swayed by evidence to the contrary, even to the 
point of believing in the bizarre.34–36 In contrast, the pres-
ence of human biofibers embedded in skin of MD patients 
is factual: the patients are not hallucinating imaginary fibers, 
and they are not implanting textile fibers or hallucinating an 
imaginary infestation. MD is not a case of fixed belief despite 
lack of medical evidence, because if fibers are present and 
they are visible under magnification, then there is medical 
evidence. MD fibers projecting from and embedded in skin 
may have elaborate configurations with branching, and the 
filaments may have tapered ends. Even skilled microsurgeons 
could not implant the fibers in that configuration.
The evidence is present in patients who have MD, but in 
order to be recognized, a physician must be willing to look. 
If patients meet the case definition for MD with visible skin 
fibers and do not believe they are infested, these patients do 
not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of Delusional disorder 
297.1, somatic type, as described in the DSM-V
. Creeping 
and crawling sensations unaccompanied by delusions of 
infestation are not enough to give a patient a diagnosis of 
delusional disorder. These sensations are consistent with the 
well-recognized symptom of formication that occurs with 
peripheral neuropathy and is associated with many medical 
conditions, such as diabetes, chronic infections, menopause, 
skin cancer, and multiple sclerosis, and exposure to various 
chemical substances, such as toxins, certain medications, 
alcohol, or recreational drugs. It is contrary to proper psy-
chiatric diagnosis to label a patient as having a delusional 
mental illness based solely on a complaint of formication.
LD and associated tick-borne diseases may be accom-
panied by mental illness.99–101 Chronic progressive neu-
rodegenerative diseases can be caused by infection and 
resulting prolonged inflammation.101,102 The spectrum of 
mental illnesses associated with LD varies in severity, 
and includes anxiety, depression, paranoia, schizophrenia, 
bipolar disorder, sensory hallucinations, and homicidal 
tendencies.101,103 Some of these neuropsychiatric conditions 
involve a delusional component. Delusions resulting from 
infectious processes do not meet the DSM-V criteria for 
delusional disorder. Furthermore, the presence of psychiatric 
comorbidities is not proof that a patient is delusional. Some 
patients have a component of posttraumatic stress disorder 
and are hypervigilant and overreactive to physical symptoms, 
rather than being delusional. If a health care provider can-
not tell the difference between a hypervigilant patient and a 
delusional patient, the provider is not qualified to diagnose 
delusional disorder.
The presentation of specimens or pictorial evidence to a 
doctor is not an indication of delusional disorder or mental 
illness. This action was never included as an indication of 
delusional disorder in the DSM-V
. Likewise, the fact that a 
patient with beliefs of infestation accompanied by move-
ment sensation has psychiatric comorbidities69,74 is not proof 
of delusional disorder and is contrary to the recommended 
practices of the DSM-V
.80 In most of the case studies that 
equate MD with DOP
, DP
, or DI, patient-supplied evidence 
was dismissed, evidence of disease (physical and labora-
tory) was dismissed, fibers were identified as being textile

in origin based solely on visual examination, physicians 
were unwilling to examine skin at sufficient magnification 
to see microscopic fibers, and all too quickly patients were 
diagnosed as being delusional in a manner that is contrary 
to the DSM-V approach to psychiatric diagnosis.
The bar set for burden of proof is higher for those propos-
ing an infectious etiology than for those proposing that MD 
is delusional. Many of the papers reviewed in this analysis 
relied solely on visual identification for “textile fibers”. Oth-
ers did not select the correct patients to study (ie, patients 
with documented embedded or projecting cutaneous fila-
ments) or did not collect the correct specimens, collecting 
instead superficial artifacts, including some that might have 
been introduced at the time of sampling. The analysis of 
MD fibers requires that the patient meets the case definition 
with the key diagnostic criterion of having colored, white, 
or black filaments protruding from or embedded in skin, and 
the correct specimens must be collected.
Fibers that are embedded in deeper layers of skin or that 
are firmly attached, originating underneath the stratum cor-
neum and projecting either outward to the surface or inward 
into the dermis, are the only specimens that are suitable for 
fiber analysis. Most often, MD fibers are present as inclu-
sions in callus material that resembles scabs. These can be 
removed for analysis by a health care practitioner, or in rare 
cases patient-supplied specimens of calluses can contain 
fibers suitable for analysis, provided that calluses composed 
of skin and fibers are embedded throughout the specimen. 
Histological sectioning and staining to detect keratin and 
collagen can visually and chemically determine the keratin 
and collagen nature of these fibers.7,83
When diagnosing mental illness, it is imperative first to 
determine if there is an underlying cause of the psychiatric 
symptom, such as an infection. None of the case studies 
reviewed in this paper or the research studies involving larger 
cohorts of MD patients looked adequately for infections, in 
particular LD. Science has to be reproducible, and there has 
to be enough detail provided in the methodology description 
for the study to be replicated. This was not the case for detect-
ing LD in many of the case studies. Borrelia spirochetes are 
readily detectable in MD tissue, but sensitive and specific 
methods are required.7,87 Although sensitive and specific 
direct-detection methods, such as antigen detection, culture 
of Borrelia spirochetes, and PCR detection of Borrelia 
DNA, exist, these methods are not standardized, and vary in 
sensitivity and specificity.104,105 They are not recommended 
by the CDC, which only endorses two-tier serological LD 
testing.7,87,106 Unfortunately, two-tier serological testing for 
LD, although specific for Bbss, lacks sensitivity and is little 
better than a coin toss in detecting LD.107,108
False negatives can occur when using two-tier testing for 
a number of reasons, including the fact that some patients 
with known LD are seronegative.107,109 In addition, there is 
significant genetic diversity in Borrelia spp. capable of caus-
ing LD and LD-like illnesses, but commercial two-tier testing 
is based on the antigens of one laboratory strain, and testing 
may not detect other Borrelia species.110–112 The fact that the 
CDC does not consider any direct detection method, not even 
culture, as being diagnostic for LD as proof of infection is 
unjustifiable. It should be noted that culture is considered 
to be the gold standard for detection of organisms by the 
American Society for Microbiology.113 The reluctance of the 
CDC to accept more sensitive testing methods for LD makes 
the evidence showing the association between LD and MD 
controversial.7,87 Those who maintain that MD is a form of 
DOP or DI and rely on the two-tier test for Borrelia detection 
claim that studies supporting an infectious etiology and an 
association with LD are flawed,72,75 yet these critics have not 
used adequate methodologies, and by failing to do so have 
not proved that methods for detecting Borrelia spp. used in 
more sophisticated studies are unreproducible or false.
Patients diagnosed with DOP in case studies are fre-
quently prescribed antipsychotic medication with potentially 
serious side effects.30 These patients are often talked into tak-
ing antipsychotic medication by health care providers using 
deceptive unethical dialogue, which can compromise patient 
autonomy.41,43,50,54,60,114 Many published articles mentioning 
MD make claims that antipsychotic drugs are effective treat-
ment for MD, but careful review of the literature suggests 
otherwise. Two systematic reviews concerning the use of 
these medications to treat DI, DOP
, or DP cases conclude 
that treatment efficacy was unproven.115,116 In many of the 
case studies reviewed in this paper, authors claimed that 
antipsychotics were used to treat MD cases, yet the patients 
received treatment in addition to antipsychotic drugs, includ-
ing antibiotics, wound dressings, antiseptics, and antipruritic 
drugs.59,65,66 Therefore, it is not certain which treatments were 
providing benefit, as the studies were uncontrolled. In fact, 
one study reported complete remission using antibiotics and 
not with antipsychotics.65
Antipsychotic medications can have off-label effects, 
such as reduced growth of parasites and anti-pruritic prop-
erties.117 Evidence showing an association between antipsy-
chotic treatment in DI, DOP
, or DP patients and resolution 
of symptoms or benefit is very limited and is more limited in 
MD cases. There has been only one randomized, double-blind,

placebo-controlled study that evaluated the effectiveness of 
the antipsychotic drug pimozide.118 This study of a small 
cohort of eleven DI patients reported that pimozide was better 
than placebo at controlling formication, but was not better at 
controlling delusions of vermin infestation or excoriation.118 
One study of 14 DI/DOP/DP patients reported that although 
seven patients remained in remission 19–48 months after 
pimozide treatment, four patients had no response to this 
antipsychotic medication.119 The variation seen in reported 
effectiveness in this study and the various studies reviewed 
here may have arisen from the fact that patients diagnosed 
with DI are a heterogeneous group of individuals, some of 
whom are truly delusional and some of whom are not.
Recent studies using advanced brain magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) technology have found that patients diag-
nosed with DI have significant gray-matter changes that differ 
from findings in both patients with nonsomatic delusions 
and healthy controls.120–122 These MRI abnormalities involve 
altered cortical thickness and surface area in various parts of 
the brain, indicating that selective delusional symptoms in 
patients may be based on specific somatic brain alterations. It 
is tempting to speculate that these brain alterations are related 
to spirochetal infection in MD, either via direct brain inva-
sion or an inflammatory response in genetically susceptible 
individuals.123,124 The intriguing link between spirochetal 
infection and brain pathology detected by advanced imaging 
methods merits further study.
Conclusion
The history of MD has taught us that scientific evidence 
must be carefully considered before a disease is written off 
as a purely psychiatric disorder. Delusional disorder is a 
diagnosis of exclusion that requires clinical judgment, and 
all underlying causes for delusional symptoms need to be 
ruled out before jumping to erroneous conclusions. Medical 
practitioners continue to consider MD a delusional disorder, 
although studies have shown that MD is strongly associated 
with spirochetal infection. According to the best-available 
scientific evidence, MD should be considered a dermopathy 
associated with tick-borne disease. Further study of the 
genetics, pathogenesis, and treatment of MD is warranted.
