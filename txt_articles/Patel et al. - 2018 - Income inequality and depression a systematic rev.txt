Most countries have witnessed a dramatic increase of income inequality in the past three decades. This paper addresses the question of whether
income inequality is associated with the population prevalence of depression and, if so, the potential mechanisms and pathways which may explain
this association. Our systematic review included 26 studies, mostly from high-income countries. Nearly two-thirds of all studies and five out of six
longitudinal studies reported a statistically significant positive relationship between income inequality and risk of depression; only one study
reported a statistically significant negative relationship. Twelve studies were included in a meta-analysis with dichotomized inequality groupings.
The pooled risk ratio was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.07-1.31), demonstrating greater risk of depression in populations with higher income inequality relative to
populations with lower inequality. Multiple studies reported subgroup effects, including greater impacts of income inequality among women and
low-income populations. We propose an ecological framework, with mechanisms operating at the national level (the neo-material hypothesis),
neighbourhood level (the social capital and the social comparison hypotheses) and individual level (psychological stress and social defeat hypothe-
ses) to explain this association. We conclude that policy makers should actively promote actions to reduce income inequality, such as progressive
taxation policies and a basic universal income. Mental health professionals should champion such policies, as well as promote the delivery of inter-
ventions which target the pathways and proximal determinants, such as building life skills in adolescents and provision of psychological therapies
and packages of care with demonstrated effectiveness for settings of poverty and high income inequality.
Key words: Income inequality, depression, neo-material hypothesis, social capital, social comparison, psychological stress, social defeat, low-
income populations
(World Psychiatry 2018;17:76–89)
The unequal distribution of income and wealth has been
growing steadily over the past three decades to astonishing
levels, fuelled by the wide adoption of neo-liberal economic
policies and globalization. In 2016, while the bottom half of the
global population collectively owned less than one percent of
total wealth, the wealthiest top 10 percent owned 89 percent of
all global assets1.
The growth of income and wealth inequality has been observ-
ed in countries at all levels of socio-economic development. In
the US, one of the richest countries in the world, the top 10 per-
cent of the population now average nearly nine times as much
income as the bottom 90 percent2. In India, an exemplar of a
low- or middle-income country (LMIC), the richest 1% owned
nearly 60% of the total wealth of the country in 2016.
However, there is a three-fold variation in the range of levels
of inequality among countries, with the most equal countries
mostly clustered in Western Europe and the most unequal
countries comprising LMIC and the US. These variations at the
country level, as well as at sub-national levels (i.e., provinces or
states) allow the exploration of the association between income
inequality and a variety of social outcomes, notably health.
There is a robust body of evidence linking inequality and
health outcomes, ranging from infant mortality and life expec-
tancy to obesity. A compelling case for a causal relationship
between inequality and a number of negative health outcomes
has been recently presented3.
Not surprisingly, there is also evidence linking income in-
equality with mental health outcomes. A significant positive
relationship has been reported between the incidence rate of
schizophrenia and country-level Gini coefficient, a widely used
measure of the distribution of income or wealth in a popula-
tion. A possible mechanism proposed for this association was
that inequality impacts negatively on social cohesion and capi-
tal, and increases chronic stress, placing individuals at a height-
ened risk of schizophrenia4.
A review of studies on the association of income inequality
and a range of mental health related outcomes reported het-
erogeneous findings, with about one third of studies observing
a positive association between income inequality and the pre-
valence or incidence of mental health problems, one third
observing mixed results for different subgroups, and one third
observing no association5. Depression was one of the mental
health outcomes considered in studies showing a positive
association with income inequality.
Although potential mechanisms that underlie the observed
association between income inequality and health have been
proposed6, little is known about the mechanisms involved in
the case of depression. Hence, there is a need for a systematic
review focusing on this association which also sets out to iden-
tify potential mechanisms and develops a conceptual frame-
work that can further our understanding and set an agenda for
future research in the field.
The present study sought to advance the scientific inquiry
of the association between income inequality and mental
health in three specific ways. First, we systematically identified
and descriptively synthesized the most updated literature on
depression and income inequality, with a focus on study char-
acteristics and potential differential impact by gender and level
76

 of poverty. Second, we quantitatively assessed the strength of
the association of income inequality and depression preva-
lence through a meta-analysis. Finally, we conducted a scoping
review of the literature to explore the potential mechanisms,
and developed a theoretical framework for this association.
By focusing on one mental health outcome (depression),
we hoped to provide a more in-depth analysis of potential
mechanisms than has previously been possible. Our ultimate
goal was to elaborate the implications of this body of evidence
on policies which influence the distribution of income and
wealth, and identify specific gaps in our knowledge which
deserve further research investment.
METHODS
Systematic review and meta-analysis
Search strategy
The search strategy was guided by our protocol (PROSPERO
registration: CRD42017072721), which is available on request.
In brief, we searched PubMed/Medline, EBSCO and PsycINFO
databases. The search string used was “(depress* OR mental)
AND (inequal* OR Gini)”. The electronic databases were
searched for titles or abstracts containing these terms in all
published articles between January 1, 1990 and July 31, 2017.
The search was limited to studies published in English and
involving human subjects. The reference lists of all included
studies were hand-searched for additional relevant reports
or key terms. If new key terms were identified (new term
included: “mood”), additional searches of the above databases
were conducted and relevant papers were added until no fur-
ther publications were found.
We included all studies providing primary quantitative
data with a measure of depression or depressive symptoms
as an outcome and any measure of income inequality at any
geographical scale. Exclusion criteria were: unpublished data
of any form including conference proceedings, case reports,
dissertations; qualitative studies; and publications reporting
duplicate data from the same population (in such cases, the
report with the larger sample size was included).
All titles and abstracts identified in the search were
screened to exclude those that were obviously irrelevant based
on the above exclusion criteria. Full-text versions were ob-
tained for all abstracts remaining after screening. Obtained
full-text articles were read and those not satisfying inclusion
criteria were subsequently removed. The remaining articles
were included in the systematic review (see Figure 1).
Analyses
Study data were extracted onto a customized sheet. Quality
assessments were independently performed by using the Sys-
tematic Appraisal of Quality in Observational Research (SAQOR)
tool, that comprises six domains (each containing two to five
questions): sample, control/comparison group, exposure/out-
come measurements, follow-up, confounders, and reporting of
data7.
The SAQOR has been adapted for use in cross-cultural psy-
chiatric epidemiology studies8. In the current study, two do-
mains were omitted (control/comparison group and follow-up),
as they were not applicable to any of the papers identified. A
summary quality assessment was made by a single rater (JKB) for
each of the four domains, and then an overall summary grade
was determined based on adequacy in the four domains. The
overall quality of each study was graded as high, moderate or low.
The meta-analysis was conducted using Cochrane Review
Manager (RevMan) version 5.39. Data were extracted from
studies to calculate risk ratios for the association of income
inequality and depression. Studies that included data on de-
pression event rates stratified by income inequality were in-
cluded in the meta-analysis.
Compared to risk ratios, odds ratios exaggerate effect sizes,
with the distortion most pronounced for outcomes with preva-
lence greater than 10%10,11. Because depression prevalence may
be greater than 10% in a population, risk is more accurately es-
timated with risk ratios. To calculate risk ratios, income in-
equality for each study was categorized as binary outcomes
(higher vs. lower income inequality in a given population).
When income inequality was categorized into three or more
groups, we re-categorized the groups as follows: in studies with
three groups, the lowest income inequality group was used
as the reference and the medium and high inequality groups
were collapsed; studies with four inequality groups were re-
categorized grouping the two lower and two higher inequality
strata; for quintiles, the two low inequality quintiles were pooled
as the reference group to compare with the three high inequality
quintiles, which were collapsed into one stratum; finally, in
studies with more than five inequality groups, these were re-
categorized into two strata of roughly equal sample size.
Unadjusted prevalence rates of depression were used when-
ever available, given the lack of consistency across studies in
variables used for adjusting outcomes. When unadjusted preva-
lence rates were not available, demographics and other charac-
teristics used for adjustment are reported. A random effects
meta-analysis was conducted because of the heterogeneity in
design, populations and outcome measures.
We conducted sensitivity analyses using the leave-one-out
approach to test the impact of excluding single studies contrib-
uting a disproportionately large effect. A forest plot of the risk
ratios with summary statistics (pooled effect sizes) was com-
pleted using RevMan. Heterogeneity among trials was calcu-
lated using the I2 measure of inconsistency.
Scoping review of mechanisms
We searched the Introduction and Discussion sections of
studies included in the systematic review, to identify authors’
hypothesized mechanisms of the relationship between inequal-
World Psychiatry 17:1 - February 2018
77
 ity and depression. We subsequently considered hypothesized
mechanisms in a recent review regarding the causal links be-
tween inequality and health3. We then compiled a list of hy-
pothesized mechanisms based on their plausibility, specif-
ically the extent to which the purported mechanisms were
supported by the data reported in the included studies. We
sought to improve the overall coherence by grouping different
hypothesized mechanisms into conceptual categories.
Finally, we supplemented these findings with an analysis of
the variability in findings from the studies included in our sys-
tematic review. This led to consideration of a number of other
factors that might inform the hypothesized mechanisms, name-
ly the geographical unit of analysis, level of national devel-
opment of the study country, effects of income inequality on
low- vs. high-income groups, cultural variations across coun-
tries, broader political and historical context, life course or
developmental stage factors, as well as gender and methodo-
logical considerations.

 articles. After screening titles or abstracts, 1,813 were removed
as they were irrelevant or clearly did not contain primary data.
Full-text reports were retrieved for 81 articles, which were
assessed for eligibility against inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Of these, 55 were removed as they did not provide primary
quantitative data on the relationship between income inequal-
ity and depression, contained duplicate data or otherwise met
exclusion criteria. Thus, 26 studies were included in the sys-
tematic review (Table 1). The selection process for included
studies is illustrated in Figure 1.
Study characteristics
The majority (N518) of the 26 studies testing associations
between income inequality and depression came from high-
income countries, with 15 studies reported from the US. In
terms of geographical scale, four were conducted at the coun-
try level, 14 at regional level (state, county, district, municipal-
ity), and eight at local area or neighbourhood level.
A number of studies were conducted in specific popula-
tions: five in older persons only19,22,27,30,35; four in adolescents
only7,23,26,28; one in students aged 17–30 years25; and one in
low-income nursing assistants21.
The most common measure of depression, used in ten
studies, was the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
Scale (CES-D), while four studies used the Composite Interna-
tional Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), two the Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ), and two the Alcohol Use Disorder and
Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule - IV (AUDADIS-IV).
Each of the remaining eight studies utilized a different instru-
ment. Godoy et al17 investigated 655 adults in villages within
the Bolivian Amazon and found a positive relationship be-
tween village-level Gini coefficient and experiences of “sad-
ness” over the last seven days.
Income inequality was most commonly measured using the
Gini coefficient (21 studies), with the remainder using a ratio
measure (e.g., 20%:20% ratio; P90/P10 ratio). Notably, all
country-level studies utilized the Gini coefficient, while ratio
measures were more commonly used in local area-level stud-
ies (three out of eight) than in regional-level studies (two out
of 14).
Associations between income inequality and depression
Nearly two-thirds (N516, 61.5%) of studies found a signifi-
cant positive relationship between income inequality and risk
of depression, while another three (11.5%) reported a positive
relationship that was significant in bivariate but not multivari-
ate regression analysis. Six studies (23.1%) found no significant
relationship, while only one (3.8%) reported a negative rela-
tionship between income inequality and risk of depression
(Table 1).
Nineteen studies did not stratify their analysis by absolute
income. Out of the seven studies that stratified analyses by
absolute income, two showed a significant effect of income
inequality on depression only in low-income participants, and
two demonstrated that the effect size was the strongest in low-
income individuals. Studies documenting greater effects in
low-income participants were conducted at either the regional
(N52) or the local level (N52). The three studies reporting no
absolute income effect were conducted at either the regional
(N52) or the country level (N51).
Five studies stratified their analyses by gender. Of these,
three found an association between income inequality and
depression in females only18,23,24, one detected no gender
effect4, and one found an association in men only in the bivar-
iate analysis29.
Although none of the studies stratified the analyses by age
group, several were conducted exclusively in adolescent or
older adult populations, and some interesting observations
can be made here. Of the four studies in adolescents only,
three found a significant association between income inequal-
ity and depression (two in the regression23,26 and one in bivari-
ate analysis only28). Of the five studies in older adults only,
three found an association between income inequality and
depression (two in regression19,22 and one in bivariate analysis
only27), one found no association30, and one found a negative
association35.
Participant ethnicity was reported in eight studies, with
only three conducted in specific ethnic populations: in nearly
9,000 Hispanic adults aged 60 and older in Mexico30; in nearly
6,500 Black and Hispanic adolescents in the US7; and in
Tsimane villagers in the Bolivian Amazon17. Notably, two of
these latter studies did not find a relationship between income
inequality and depression. Of the five studies that stratified
their analysis by ethnicity, only one found an ethnicity effect,
with the relationship between income inequality and depres-
sion most pronounced in middle-class Blacks in a population
representative panel in South Africa4.
Of the 26 studies, only six were longitudinal, allowing for
temporal analyses. Of these, five reported a significant positive
relationship
between
income
inequality
and
depression
4,16,17,21,24; and one reported no association31. All except two
studies had large sample sizes of over 1,000 participants (rang-
ing from 1,35512 to 293,40515).
Meta-analysis
Twelve studies were included in the meta-analysis, based
on availability of event rates of depression to calculate risk
ratios. Quality ratings of the included studies using SAQOR
ranged from high to moderate (see Table 2). The pool of stud-
ies included six US studies, three multi-country studies, one
UK study, one Brazil study, and one South Africa study. Two of
the US studies were limited to older adults. One study only
included women18. One multi-country study limited the sam-
ple to university students25.
Four studies employed three strata of inequality13,14,18,35;
one study employed four strata12 and two studies employed

 quintiles15.29. All were re-categorized as dichotomous as de-
scribed earlier. Ladin et al19 divided the sample of ten
European countries into five high inequality versus five low
inequality countries. We followed a similar procedure for
Steptoe et al’s25 study of 23 countries, by creating a group of
11 low inequality countries and 12 high inequality countries.
For the South Africa data, we extracted information from
the two studies that employed the South Africa National
Income Dynamics Study4,31. Data were available from Burns
et al4 for the depression prevalence by municipality. Adjaye-
Gbewonyo et al31 calculated Gini coefficients for each munici-
pality based on the 2011 census. We integrated depression
prevalence data and Gini coefficient data by municipality and
split the dataset into approximate halves around a Gini coeffi-
cient of 0.75.
Unadjusted data were used for all studies when available.
Unadjusted data were not presented in the study by Cifuentes
et al14, and rates were adjusted for age, gender and marital sta-
tus. Fan et al15 only presented adjusted prevalence figures: rates
were adjusted for gender, age, race/ethnicity, marital status,
education, household income, and chronic medical conditions.
Based on the 12 studies with dichotomized inequality group-
ings, the pooled risk ratio was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.07-1.31), demon-
strating greater risk of depression in populations with higher
income inequality relative to those with lower income inequal-
ity (see Figure 2). The heterogeneity was very high, I2598%,
which is likely due in part to the diversity of sample designs,
populations, measures used, and adjustments and weighting
in analyses. In all sensitivity analyses, the pooled risk ratio was
significant for higher income inequality associated with in-
creased risk of depression (p<0.05).
Multiple studies conducted moderator analyses by stratify-
ing the samples by gender, absolute income, country econom-
ic status, and ethnicity/race. Because of the limited number of
studies with outcomes that could be dichotomized by depres-
sion and income inequality, we did not create subpools of
studies or employ meta-regression to assess these potential
moderators.
Scoping review of mechanisms
Based on the results of the systematic review, a number of
potential mechanisms of the inequality-depression relation-
ship may be hypothesized, operating at different ecological
levels, from the individual to the neighbourhood to the region-
al or national levels.
At the individual level, the effects of income inequality on
general health are likely to be primarily mediated through psy-
chological stress3. This may be regarded as the final mecha-
nism mediating the effects of income inequality on depression
in a range of pathways.
At the neighbourhood levels, two mechanisms are hypothe-
sized. The first is the social comparison or status anxiety hypoth-
eses36, which argue that comparing oneself to those who are
better off in a highly unequal context creates feelings of social
defeat or status anxiety4,37. In a similar vein, Walker et al38 hy-
pothesized feelings of withdrawal and shame experienced by
those in lower social positions. The second neighbourhood
mechanism is the social capital hypothesis, which argues that
income inequality erodes social capital, including two key com-
ponents: cognitive social capital (especially social trust)26 and
structural social capital (the organizational and structural ar-
rangements which facilitate social interactions and build so-
cial trust and cooperation, for example through group mem-
bership)39.

 Social capital is critical, because it facilitates social integra-
tion (a dynamic process by which members of a social group
participate in dialogue or collaborate to achieve a shared
social goal). Income inequality therefore undermines social
capital and social integration, promoting social isolation,
alienation and loneliness. It also undermines perceptions of
fairness (a component of trust)37. Ichida et al40 confirmed the
social capital hypothesis in Japan, showing that social capital
(measured as social trust) mediated the effect of inequality on
self-rated health. This is supported by Durkheim’s theory of
social integration and social regulation41, the failure of which
he linked to suicide.
Perceptions of fairness and trust are also consistent with
Merton’s anomie disjunction between society’s goals and norma-
tive structures governing the means to attain that goal42. This is
more exaggerated in societies with higher levels of inequality,
where the means of attaining upward social mobility are se-
verely constrained, and therefore there is a disjunction be-
tween society’s goals or aspirations (for example of acquiring
wealth) and the means to attain that goal, which are not acces-
sible to those who are lower on the socio-economic hierarchy.
Both the above neighbourhood mechanisms may be more
pronounced at certain developmental stages, in particular in
adolescence, when social trust and group membership are
being established, and when most mental health problems
emerge. For example, social status was associated with depres-
sion among adolescents whose parents had lowest levels of
education7. In addition, social comparison may be amplified
by other group identities, for example ethnicity or gender.
At the national or regional levels, the neo-material hypothe-
sis proposes that greater income inequality coexists with a
wide range of material deprivations which are relevant to
health43. These include lack of investment in housing, educa-
tion and public transport as well as pollution control, healthy
food availability and accessibility of health care. Thus, greater
inequality leads to worse physical health (for example due to
less public spending on health care in more unequal societies),
leading in turn to an increased rate of depression.
This hypothesis was supported by Muramatsu22, who found
that the association between inequality and depression was
stronger among those with more illnesses. However, it is worth
noting Zimmerman et al’s opposite finding that more unequal
states did not in fact spend less on health care34. Also, Fone
et al36 argue that it is unlikely that the neo-material hypothesis
would apply at small area level (such as neighbourhoods), as
resource allocation decisions for major services are not typi-
cally made within these areas.
For all of these potential mechanisms, it is important to con-
sider a range of other factors that may moderate the relation-
ship between income inequality and depression, reflected in
the available studies. The first is the geographical unit of anal-
ysis. Of the six studies that found no association, five con-
ducted analysis at the district level, and national level effects
appeared to be more marked in the studies included in this
review. According to Ahern and Galea12, this is likely to be at
least partially influenced by the nature of the area demarca-
tion. For example, if a neighbourhood includes strong contrasts
of high- versus low-income groups, the effect of income in-

85
 equality is likely to be more pronounced at that neighbour-
hood level. But frequently neighbourhoods involve homo-
geneous demarcations, and the effect may then be less pro-
nounced.
In a similar vein, Fone et al36 found that in Wales income
deprivation was more important than income inequality for
common mental disorders at the local neighbourhood level,
but that the effect of income inequality became more evident
at larger regional levels. Furthermore, Chen and Crawford44
reported that, when comparing US counties and states, the in-
come inequality/health relationship was more evident at the
state than the county level, (although this was true for health
insurance as an outcome but not for self-reported health).
Thus, it may be possible to argue that different mechanisms
operate at different geographical levels or units of analysis.
A second important consideration is the level of national
development, for example as measured using the human de-
velopment index (HDI). One study showed a possible interac-
tion with country HDI level, namely that the inequality/depres-
sion association was more evident in higher HDI countries14.
Income inequality may matter in high-income countries with
low levels of poverty, but not in low- or middle-income coun-
tries with high levels of poverty, where the effects of material
poverty and absolute income may be more significant.
A third consideration is the effect of income inequality on
low- vs. high-income groups. Within countries, the effect of
inequality on depression appears to be more pronounced
among low-income groups12. This is consistent with the hypoth-
esized role of upward social mobility, the constraints of which
are more likely to be experienced by low-income groups. The
hypothesis that inequality is deleterious for high-income
groups too is proposed by other authors3. Kawachi et al45 argue
that the wealthy in highly unequal societies cannot escape
the “pathologies of poverty”, including crime, violence and
exposure to some infectious diseases.
A fourth consideration is cultural variation across countries.
Although this may be difficult to test empirically, Steptoe
et al25 considered the results in a multi-country study with
respect to cultural variation along the axis of individualism
and collectivism. The likelihood of high levels of depressive
symptoms was lower in more individualistic cultures, with
26% reduction in the odds of elevated symptoms with every
unit change in individualism-collectivism score.
A fifth consideration is the broader political and historical
context within which depression and inequality are measured.
For example, in post-apartheid South Africa, there have been
expectations of rapid social improvements, and there is clear
evidence of improvements for some people, but for those who
remain in poverty there is a sense of frustration, alienation,
disappointment and anger, manifest in frequent service deliv-
ery protests4. This may well exaggerate the effects of income
inequality on depression.
A sixth consideration is life course or developmental stage.
According to one study, childhood social class is more predic-
tive of self-rated health than adult social class16. Prevalence of
depression varies substantially across the life course46, and
early exposure to inequality may well affect later mental
health. Most of the studies included in this review lack a life
course or developmental framework, even when the effect of
inequality on specific age groups was examined, for example
in the case of adolescent depression.
A seventh consideration is gender. In at least one study23,
the effect of inequality on depression was found for adolescent
girls but not for boys. This was confirmed by Hiilamo47 in a
study in Finland, which explored changes in municipality-
level relative poverty and antidepressant prescriptions from
1995 to 2010, and found a positive association for young adult
females.
A final consideration is the methods employed by the stud-
ies themselves. For example, contrary to the finding that the
association between inequality and depression was less evi-
dent in more local, homogeneous populations, Fiscella and
Franks16 did find a positive association at local level. This find-
ing may be attributable to the study design, which employed
longitudinal, multi-level methods and collected baseline data
on county income inequality, individual income, age, gender,
self-rated health, level of depressive symptoms, and severity of
biomedical morbidity.
DISCUSSION
In this paper we present, to our knowledge, the most com-
prehensive review of the evidence on the relationship between
income inequality and depression. Despite the relatively small
evidence base (especially from LMIC) and methodological lim-
itations of the available studies, we report a compelling quan-
titative association between income inequality and depression.
Even though the absolute effect size was relatively small (risk
ratio of 1.19), the translation of this risk to population mental
health is likely to be very large.
Further, we note that the primary outcome of the studies
we included was a categorical outcome of “case-level” depres-
sion. This is a crude indicator of population mental health,
and the associations between income inequality and mood
are likely to be greater when the latter is treated as a continu-
ous dimension, which could capture dose-effects of the degree
of inequality on the distribution of affective symptoms.
If our findings are indicative of a causal relationship, then
we should expect worse mental health globally in the years
ahead, as income inequality is continuing to increase in most
countries, making the United Nations (UN) Sustainable De-
velopment Goal targets for mental health48 even harder to
achieve. This is especially likely to be the case for disadvan-
taged or vulnerable groups in the population that already bear
a disproportionate burden of mental health problems, such as
women, adolescents, older adults and low-income groups.
The heterogeneity of the findings of studies across popula-
tions and over time is not surprising, given the complexity of
86
World Psychiatry 17:1 - February 2018
 likely mechanisms and pathways, and their moderation by a
range of contextual factors which we have attempted to delin-
eate. These mechanisms operate at different ecological levels,
but the final pathways are, as with any mental health problem,
uniquely individual, moderated by a range of distal and proxi-
mal determinants.
Although we do strongly endorse the need to “unpack”
these mechanisms through carefully designed studies, such re-
search is likely to be complex, time-consuming and costly.
Thus, we propose that the evidence which already exists is suf-
ficient to take pre-emptive action to halt the potentially dam-
aging effects of income inequality on the mental health of
populations.
Implications for reducing the global burden of depression
Our ecological framework offers indications for the kinds of
interventions which hold promise (see Figure 3). Obviously, at
the national or regional level, economic policies which pro-
mote the fair distribution of income, for example through a uni-
versal basic income and progressive taxation, are potentially the
most tractable49. Additionally, promoting social policies that
reduce gender inequities which systematically disadvantage
women, and income inequities, such as universal health cov-
erage and expanding opportunities for educational attainment,
can reduce the impact of the neo-material effect on low-income
populations.
In addition to structural interventions, the mechanisms we
propose suggest attractive opportunities for proximal inter-
ventions to mitigate the adverse personal consequences of liv-
ing in unequal societies. The Disease Control Priorities pro-
ject50 has recommended a series of interventions for the pre-
vention, treatment and care of mental health problems, most
of which can be delivered through community and routine
health care platforms, using task-sharing by non-specialist
providers. Particularly relevant examples would include inter-
ventions in early life through adolescence to build resilience
(for example, parenting interventions and life skills interven-
tions), as well as promoting early detection and self-help for
mood and anxiety disorders (for example, through improving
access to empirically supported digital apps, especially with
guidance)51.
A recent systematic review has demonstrated the effective-
ness of psychological therapies delivered by non-specialists in
low-resource settings52. Such therapies may be modified when
delivered in the context of high inequality through a focus on
mechanisms related to cognitive comparisons leading to social
defeat and worthlessness. For example, interventions that focus
on demoralization53,54 may be especially important in highly
inequitable societies and communities. Third-wave psycholog-
ical therapies that include components of self-validation may
also counter social defeat and worthlessness associated with
depression and suicidality55. These therapies are currently be-
ing adapted for delivery in settings of extreme poverty56.
Interventions that harness the power of social networking
sites to build social capital also show promise at mobilizing
specific subgroups and reducing the risk of social isolation.
Pilot programs in Mexico and South Africa have shown encour-
aging results at reducing levels of anxiety, depression and feel-
ings of social isolation in adolescents and pregnant women
with HIV/AIDS57-60. Marshall et al35 report that social interac-
tions and networks among subgroups in mixed-income neigh-
bourhoods cushion the impact of income inequality on de-
pression.
Other research points to the role of social interactions, cul-
tural biases and belief systems in maintaining and perpetuat-
ing conditions for income inequality61,62. Thus, it is important
that we develop interventions that target social and cultural
aspects of inequalities (for example, designing institutional
platforms such as schools and health institutions) to enhance
social capital, and all interventions must be guided by a strong
emphasis on equitable coverage. This is consistent with a shift
from cultural competency to “structural competency”, which
emphasizes the need for mental health providers to be knowl-
edgeable of context and resources of their patients and actively
draw upon resources to mitigate social and structural determi-
nants of mental illness63.
Limitations of the study
There are limitations to our study which should be noted.
First, publication bias, namely a propensity for journals to pub-
lish positive findings, may overestimate the strength or consis-
tency of the association between inequality and depression.
Second, there was a heterogeneity of outcome measures for
depression, with some studies not utilizing validated assess-
ment instruments, and a diversity in sample size and sampling
strategies, all of which impact depression prevalence esti-
mates64. Third, the majority of studies failed to stratify their
samples by important socio-demographic factors such as gen-
der, age and absolute income, limiting our ability to explore in
greater depth the controversial question of whether the nega-
tive effects of income inequality are evenly distributed across
the population or if certain vulnerable groups are particularly
affected65.
Regarding the meta-analysis, we were unable to use unad-
justed data across all studies, and it is likely that the studies
that adjusted inequality by outcomes reflect aspects of the
association differently than unadjusted studies. In addition,
the inequality cut-off for each study was different, based on
the relative levels of inequality within the sample. For exam-
ple, inequality levels within the South Africa dataset were high
on average compared to European nations. Therefore, our
findings are reflective of regional and national relative income
inequality rather than the effect of absolute inequality (e.g.,
dividing all samples at one specific Gini coefficient cut-off,
which would have been arbitrary, given that inequality is, by
definition, a relative measure).
The meta-analysis also demonstrated high heterogeneity.
As the pool of studies examining income inequality and men-
World Psychiatry 17:1 - February 2018
87
 tal health grows, it will be possible to perform more subgroup
analyses with studies that employ comparable designs and
samples in order to reduce heterogeneity.
Implications for research
Future research should aim to unpack the mechanisms
underlying the association between inequality and depression,
in particular to explain the heterogeneity of findings across
contexts. This research should involve prospective studies in
diverse countries, in particular in a range of LMIC which are
witnessing rapid socio-economic changes, such as the BRICS
nations. Notably, Brazil and South Africa, which both have
high levels of inequality, showed comparable high effects of
income inequality on depression in our meta-analysis (risk
ratios were 1.38 and 1.33 respectively).
Future studies should include the effects of changes in in-
come inequality (at different geographical levels and popula-
tion subgroups of analysis) over time, with embedded assess-
ments of hypothesized individual and area-level mechanisms;
and evaluation of the effects of interventions addressing the
proposed pathways. Additionally, further exploration of the
studies with equivocal findings, such as countries with high
levels of income inequality which did not show an increased
prevalence of depression, should also be conducted, to under-
stand possible structural differences, policies or socio-cultural
factors that mitigate this effect.
It is important to methodologically take note of the histori-
cal, political and cultural forces that may shape the association
between income inequality and depression in developing coun-
tries. Modelling contextually grounded forces can shed greater
light on the precise mechanisms that may be operating in these
contexts.
CONCLUSIONS
Mental health professionals, regardless of their political per-
suasion, should carefully assess the evidence presented in this
review to shape their position with respect to the ideologically
contentious issue of income inequality.
They should ally with other stakeholders in government
and civil society who are arguing for a fairer, more equitable
distribution of income, as this is a major social determinant of
poor mental health, while also drawing attention to the need
for greater investments in proven individual interventions for
the prevention and treatment of depression.
