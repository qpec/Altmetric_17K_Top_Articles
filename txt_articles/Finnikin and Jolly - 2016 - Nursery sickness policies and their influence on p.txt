 INTRODUCTION
Acute infective conjunctivitis (AIC) is a 
common condition in preschool children.1 
It is usually mild and self-limiting, often 
with no requirement for treatment or a 
doctor’s appointment.2 Evidence suggests, 
however, that parents and guardians are 
advised by childcare providers (CPs) to take 
their children with conjunctivitis to their GP 
for assessment.3–5 Furthermore, some CPs 
will not permit affected children to return 
to child care until antibiotics have been 
prescribed,3,4,6,7 thus parents are obtaining 
antibiotics to get their child readmitted. A 
situation in which antibiotics are prescribed 
for non-clinical reasons is difficult to justify 
and requires further investigation.
Although most cases (50–75%) of AIC are 
bacterial in origin,8 the aetiology is difficult to 
determine clinically and only 36% of doctors 
are confident in differentiating between viral 
and bacterial conjunctivitis.9,10 In bacterial 
conjunctivitis, there may be some clinical 
benefit obtained from topical antibiotics;11 
however, this benefit is perhaps not seen 
in children and topical chloramphenicol 
shortens the duration of symptoms by 
only 0.3 days.2 Despite this, most clinicians 
usually prescribe antibiotics for AIC.10
Perceived 
pressure 
from 
parents, 
employers, educators, and pharmaceutical 
companies are factors that influence the 
decision to prescribe antibiotics to children 
with acute infections.12 For AIC, GPs report 
that the need for the child to return to 
nursery can be paramount in the decision 
to prescribe antibiotics.3 Parental pressure 
may originate from an unrealistic view 
of the benefit of antibiotics as 60.8% of 
parents believe their child will not get better 
without treatment.3 Parents may also be 
the means through which pressure from 
CPs is exerted, although the evidence 
regarding this is conflicting. One study 
reported that CP attendance was not seen 
as a significant influence in parents seeking 
treatment,13 whereas another indicated that 
some parents seek antibiotics solely for 
the purposes of preventing exclusion or 
expediting readmission.4
Childcare providers in the UK follow a 
statutory framework which stipulates that 
they must have a procedure for responding 
to children who are ill or infectious, but 
gives no details about what this should 
be.14 Public Health England (PHE) (and 
equivalent organisations internationally) 
advise on managing infectious diseases 
to reduce the public health burden. The 
PHE guidance states that no school or 
nursery exclusion is required for children 
with AIC, and there is no requirement for 
treatment with antibiotics.15 This message 
is echoed in Welsh and Scottish guidance, 
as well as the equivalent US document, 
which states that there is no evidence that 
treatment or exclusion reduces the spread 
of conjunctivitis.16–18
There is evidence that sickness policies 
of CPs do not always comply with public 
health advice. An audit of policies from 
58 CPs in Wales found that 95% required

Abstract
Background
Acute infective conjunctivitis is common 
among preschool children. Public Health 
England (PHE) recommends that children with 
conjunctivitis do not need to be excluded from 
child care, but childcare providers are required 
to determine their own sickness policies and 
prior research suggests that children are 
often excluded until they are treated or have 
recovered. How the content of these policies 
impacts on prescribing decisions has not been 
quantified.
Aim
To assess the content of childcare providers’ 
sickness policies and determine the impact 
they have on clinicians’ prescribing.
Design and setting
An audit of childcare providers’ sickness 
policies and a questionnaire among primary 
care clinicians.
Method
Sickness policies from childcare providers 
across the UK were compared with PHE 
guidance. Clinicians completed a questionnaire 
on the impact that childcare provider policies 
have on their decision to prescribe antibiotics to 
preschool children with conjunctivitis.
Results
Of 164 policies examined, 86.7% excluded 
children with conjunctivitis and 49.4% 
of policies specified a requirement for 
antibiotics. Two-hundred clinicians completed 
questionnaires and 42.6% replied that they had 
been influenced by childcare policies when 
deciding whether to prescribe antibiotics in this 
scenario. Furthermore, 15.4% admitted that 
childcare policies had been the only reason they 
prescribed antibiotics.
Conclusion
Most of the childcare providers’ sickness 
policies contain requirements that are 
inconsistent with PHE guidance. The 
requirements of childcare sickness policies 
are likely to be resulting in unnecessary 
primary care consultations and thousands 
of prescriptions for antibiotics with little 
demonstrable clinical or public health benefit.

 children with AIC to be excluded.4 A similar 
result was found among English nurseries 
in 2005.3 Excluded children are likely to 
be taken to their GP (indeed this may be 
required by their CP) resulting in potentially 
unnecessary consultations. In the US, 88% 
of parents sought acute medical care for 
children who had been excluded from a 
childcare setting.19
This study aimed to establish what 
proportion of sickness policies of UK CPs 
comply with PHE guidance, and examining 
how these policies influence prescribing of 
antibiotics to preschool children with AIC.
METHOD
Data were collected from two sources: 
an analysis of daycare nursery sickness 
policies and a questionnaire among primary 
care prescribers. 
Content of childcare providers’ policies
A search was performed in January 2015 
using 
the 
terms 
‘nursery’ 
AND 
‘conjunctivitis’ 
in Google™ limited to UK domains and the 
dates 1 April 2010 to 31 December 2014 
to exclude policies published before the 
latest PHE guidance. All returned page 
descriptions were examined but only those 
pertaining to nursery sickness policies were 
included in the data collection.
Data were extracted to IBM SPSS 
Statistics (version 21). Exclusion criteria 
were coded according to predetermined 
categories that had arisen through scoping 
searches. Where two or more criteria 
were specified, the most restrictive was 
recorded. Any advice relating to antibiotics 
was recorded as well as whether a source 
of information was quoted and whether 
the nursery belonged to a larger group 
of nurseries or not. The postcode of the 
nursery and an e-mail contact were also 
obtained.
Analysis was performed in SPSS and was 
primarily descriptive. Confidence intervals 
(CIs) on single proportions were calculated20 
and χ2 or Fisher exact tests were used to 
test the relationship between categorical 
variables.
Questionnaire to prescribers
A questionnaire was designed to quantify the 
extent to which primary care clinicians feel 
they are influenced by CPs’ policies when 
deciding whether to prescribe antibiotics to 
preschool children with AIC. The population 
of interest consisted of prescribing primary 
care clinicians (GPs, GP registrars, and 
nurse prescribers). A pragmatic approach to 
sampling was required and this resulted in 
a chunk sampling method.21 Clinicians who 
attended three educational events in the 
West Midlands were invited to participate 
and questionnaires were distributed at 
registration and collected at the end of the 
event. The topics of the events were broadly 
clinical but none focused on antimicrobial 
stewardship or conjunctivitis.
Demographic 
and 
occupational 
characteristics of the participants were 
obtained. Participants not able to prescribe 
chloramphenicol to preschool children 
were excluded. Participants were asked 
to consider a vignette of a preschool 
child diagnosed with AIC and respond to 
three statements about the influence of 
CP policies on their prescribing decisions 
(Box 1). An open ‘any comments’ question 
was included to illustrate important points, 
identify points of contention or conflict, 
and potentially identify avenues for further 
How this fits in
Other studies have shown that childcare 
sickness exclusion policies do not always 
follow public health guidance. Using acute 
infective conjunctivitis as an exemplar, the 
present study confirms this disparity and 
establishes that these policies are likely to 
be leading to unnecessary consultations 
and prescriptions for antibiotics in primary 
care. Finding solutions to this problem would 
be a step towards more rational antibiotic 
prescribing in primary care. GPs are ideally 
positioned to help local childcare providers 
produce evidence-based policies but dealing 
with the issue at a national level is surely the 
most effective solution.
Box 1. Questionnaire vignette and question stems
For the following questions, please consider the scenario of a preschool child who presents with their 
parent or guardian. You have made a diagnosis of acute infective conjunctivitis.
1. Have you ever prescribed topical antibiotics (for example, chloramphenicol eye drops) in this situation?
2.  
Has the policy of a childcare provider (for example, daycare nursery) ever influenced your decision to 
prescribe in this situation?
3. Has the policy of a childcare provider ever been the main reason you have prescribed in this situation?
4. Has the policy of a childcare provider ever been the only reason you have prescribed in this situation?

 investigation through content analysis.22 
Statistical analysis was performed as above. 
Binary logistic regression was undertaken 
to identify any clinician characteristics that 
increased the likelihood of being influenced 
by CP policies.
RESULTS
The internet search returned 273 unique 
pages, of which 164 (60.1%) were relevant 
CP sickness policies. Fourteen per cent of 
CPs were group nurseries; the rest were 
individual organisations. The nurseries 
were spread across England, Scotland, and 
Wales, with some clustering around large 
urban areas.
Only 22 policies (13.4%; 95% CI = 9.0% 
to 19.5%) stated that no exclusion was 
required for children with AIC (‘compliant’ 
CPs). The remaining CP policies required 
exclusion (‘non-compliant’ CPs). There 
was considerable heterogeneity in the 
requirements specified for an excluded 
child to be allowed to return (Box 2) and 
these were grouped into the predefined 
categories (Table 1). Twenty-two CPs (13.4%) 
had more than one exclusion criterion 
(most commonly ‘X days of antibiotics’ and 
‘until symptom free’).
Overall, 
almost 
half 
(81, 
49.4%; 
95% CI = 41.8% to 57.0%) of the policies 
required treatment with antibiotics before 
a child with AIC was readmitted to nursery 
(Table 2). Some policies quoted a source; 23 
CPs (14.0%; 95% CI = 9.5% to 20.2%) quoted 
PHE (or the Health Protection Agency), but, 
of these, only nine (40.9%; 95% CI = 23.3% 
to 61.3%) had an exclusion policy in line with 
PHE guidance. Those CPs that quoted PHE 
were significantly more likely to follow PHE 
guidance than nurseries that did not quote a 
source (P<0.001) (Table 3). Group nurseries 
were not significantly more likely to follow 
PHE guidance than individual organisations 
(21.7% versus 12.0%, P = 0.20).
Questionnaire to clinicians
Of the 428 questionnaires distributed, 200 
(46.7%) were returned completed. Table 4 
shows the characteristics of the responders.
Overall, 42.6% (95% CI = 35.7% to 49.7%; 
n = 80) of eligible responders reported that 
their prescribing of topical antibiotics in 
AIC has been influenced by CP policies. 
One-quarter (25.5%; 95% CI = 19.8% to 
32.2%; n = 48) stated that CP policy was 
the main reason they had prescribed, and 
in 15.4% (95% CI = 11.0% to 21.3%; n = 29) 
of responses this was the only reason for 
prescribing.
Only the age of the clinician showed 
a significant association with a positive 
response to the ‘ever influenced’ stem. 
Both age categories 30–39 years (OR 
2.25; 95% CI = 1.04 to 4.87, P = 0.04) and 
40–49 years (OR 2.25; 95% CI = 1.14 to 4.45, 
P = 0.02) were significantly more likely to 
have been influenced by CP policies than 
the ≥50 years age category. This association 
was not present for the ‘main reason’ and 
‘only reason’ stems.
Forty-seven participants elected to leave 
comments on the questionnaire. Some 
of these comments demonstrated an 
awareness of the situation and the difficulty 
it presented to prescribers and parents:
‘I have found it very frustrating feeling 
compelled to prescribe because working 
mothers tell me the child cannot attend 
nursery until they have been treated.’
Other responses suggested a more 
clinically dogmatic approach to prescribing:
‘Antibiotics are given when needed. 
Childcare provider pressure does not work.’
Finally, some participants noted that 
they have tried to develop solutions to the 
problem:
‘I print off a copy of the HPA guidance … and 
Box 2. Illustrative extracts from sickness policies
‘… child will be sent home and can return when medication has been prescribed.’
‘Children with conjunctivitis may attend, but exclusion may become necessary if there is an outbreak and the 
situation becomes unmanageable, as per the Health Protection Agency’s advice.’
‘Exclusion not always necessary, however a doctor’s opinion must be sought.’
‘Conjunctivitis is extremely infectious and children should not attend nursery until symptom free.’
‘We will also not administer antibiotics for conjunctivitis. In cases of this, children should return to nursery 
when the conjunctivitis has cleared. I.e. the infection is no longer weeping out the eye sockets.’

DISCUSSION
Summary
From the CP policies examined, clearly 
there is a large disparity between the 
sickness exclusion practices of nurseries 
and the advice issued by public health 
authorities. Most nurseries excluded 
children with AIC but there was a huge 
amount of heterogeneity in the constraints 
imposed before children could return to 
nursery. Many policies required children to 
be symptom free before returning, which, 
although potentially justifiable given that 
AIC can easily be transmitted, could result 
in several days away from nursery for a 
child who may be quite well. This obviously 
has economic and social ramifications for 
the child’s main caregivers.
Perhaps more significantly, nearly half 
of all policies necessitated antibiotics to be 
prescribed to the child before readmission 
to nursery. Although antibiotics may 
marginally reduce clinical recovery time, 
to allow a child to return to nursery 
because they have commenced antibiotics 
(as one-third of policies state) makes no 
sense clinically as there is no evidence 
that treatment decreases transmission of 
AIC. With 1.2 million children in nurseries23 
and 20% of preschool children presenting 
to their GP with conjunctivitis each year,1 
there are potentially 240 000 consultations, 
120 000 antibiotic prescriptions, and 360 000 
days lost from work3 that are a result of 
nursery policies rather than clinical need.
The CP policies suggest that many 
children are being sent to their GP to be 
prescribed antibiotics for AIC, yet only 43% 
of clinicians admit to being influenced 
by CP policies in this clinical scenario. 
Therefore, this figure may be higher
. The 
estimate may be inaccurate because 
parents are purchasing antibiotics directly 
from pharmacies (available for children 
aged ≥2 years), supported by evidence 
of increased over-the-counter sales of 
chloramphenicol.24 Alternatively, perhaps 
the study findings underreport the true 
influence of CP policies because of bias. 
There is inherent sampling and responder 
bias in the questionnaire methodology, 
but there is also potential for what may 
be termed ‘professional acceptability bias’ 
(analogous to social acceptability bias).25 
Here, responses may be prejudiced by 
what the participant feels someone in their 
profession should be doing, rather than 
reporting what they are actually doing if it 
may be considered unprofessional. Despite 
these potential biases, the fact that 15% 
of clinicians report prescribing antibiotics 
because of CP policies is a significant finding 
given the lack of evidence underpinning 
exclusion practices.
Strengths and limitations
This examination of CP sickness policies is 
the most comprehensive to date in terms of 
the number and variety of CPs included and 
is the first study to demonstrate audit of CP 
policies using publicly available information. 
It is a simple methodology that provides a 
snapshot of current practice. By obtaining 
data from policies published on the 
internet, responder bias was eliminated. 
Rose and colleagues3 and Rooshenas and 
colleagues4 had response rates of 74.0% 
and 55.0%, respectively. Reliability of the 
results is further improved through direct 
analysis of the policy rather than, as Rose 
and colleagues did, relying on CPs to 
answer questions on the content of their 
policies. 
Not all CPs have websites, but there is no 
reason to suggest that the sickness policies 
of CPs with an online presence should be 
systematically different from those without. 
Indeed, it is probable that CPs that publish 
their sickness policies online are more likely 
to believe that their policy is evidence-based 
than those that do not. Thus any bias from 
the sampling is likely to be in the direction 
of under-identification of non-compliant 
policies. Despite including all the policies 
available, however, this represented only a 
small fraction of the approximately 25 000

 UK-registered nurseries.23 Additionally, the 
policies of CPs other than nurseries have 
the potential to exert similar influence on 
clinicians, but these were not investigated.
The questionnaire to clinicians was 
designed to measure the influence that CPs 
have on prescribing but was not validated. 
This is the first time this has been explored 
in a quantitative way. It is difficult, however, 
to quantify something as intangible as 
‘influence’ and a questionnaire method 
can only provide an approximate measure. 
Furthermore, the sample was limited to 
clinicians working in one geographical 
area of the UK and, although the analysis 
of CPs’ policies above does not suggest 
any systematic geographical variation, this 
may affect generalisability of the findings. 
Additionally, the sample was drawn from 
attendees at educational events, which 
introduced a sampling bias. A response 
rate of 46.7% may compound the impact of 
responder bias as it is slightly lower than 
expectations informed by the literature.26,27
This research has not considered the 
views of parents or CPs on this subject, 
although some work has previously been 
undertaken in this area.4,28 Further research 
with CPs is necessary to gain a better 
understanding of the rationale behind the 
content of sickness policies.
Comparison with existing literature
The degree of dissidence of CP policies with 
public health guidance is consistent with that 
found in previous studies adding reliability to 
the finding.3,4 Rooshenas and colleagues 
also considered whether CPs required 
children with AIC to receive treatment.4 Of 
the 58 policies they identified that mentioned 
conjunctivitis, 18 specified a requirement for 
treatment (31.0%; 95% CI = 20.6% to 43.8% 
[CI calculated from original data]), which is 
comparable with the results of the present 
study. Sickness policies in the US require 
antibiotics to be given for AIC in most cases.7
Qualitative studies have found that 
clinicians often feel pressure to prescribe 
because of the policies of CPs,3,29,30 but this 
study is the first attempt to quantify the 
impact of this pressure.
Implications for practice
Many GPs will be aware of this issue already 
but this research highlights the potential 
impact of clinically unjustifiable sickness 
exclusion practices. Even though antibiotics 
are rarely clinically indicated for AIC, it is 
easy to see why clinicians may feel that a 
prescription is required.
To reduce inappropriate prescribing, 
one strategy would be to improve CPs’ 
understanding of AIC and encourage 
them to adhere to public health guidance. 
Further research may inform strategies 
to achieve this. GPs are perhaps best 
positioned to lead improvement by building 
relationships between themselves and local 
CPs. Although this would require an initial 
resource investment, this may be offset by 
a reduction in inappropriate consultations.
To make significant changes, CP policies 
should be influenced at a national level. 
Adherence to guidance could be improved 
through 
existing 
Ofsted 
inspections 
examining the policy content. CPs not 
following PHE guidance could be required 
to explain this decision to ensure that 
disparities are justifiable.
