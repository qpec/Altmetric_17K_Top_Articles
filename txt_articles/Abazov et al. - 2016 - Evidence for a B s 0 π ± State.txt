We report evidence for a narrow structure, X(5568), in the decay sequence X(5568) → B0
sπ±,
B0
s → J/ψφ, J/ψ → µ+µ−, φ → K+K−. This is evidence for the first instance of a hadronic state
with valence quarks of four different flavors. The mass and natural width of this state are measured
to be m = 5567.8 ± 2.9 (stat)+0.9
−1.9 (syst) MeV/c2 and Γ = 21.9 ± 6.4 (stat)+5.0
−2.5 (syst) MeV/c2. If
the decay is X(5568) → B∗
sπ± → B0
sγπ± with an unseen γ, m(X(5568)) will be shifted up by
m(B∗
s) − m(B0
s) ∼ 49 MeV/c2. This measurement is based on 10.4 fb−1 of pp collision data at √s
= 1.96 TeV collected by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron collider.

During the last few years several resonant states that
cannot be conventional quark-antiquark mesons or three-
quark baryons have been observed [1–8]. Taking into ac-
count the decay modes and charges of these states they
may be interpreted as four-quark or five-quark states.
These states have one common feature: they consist of a
combination of heavy and light quarks. These discoveries
open up a new era of multi-quark hadron spectroscopy.
Various combinations of heavy and light mesons may be
tested. One such system is the combination of the heavy
B0
s or B
0
s meson and the light π± meson.
Such sys-
tems are composed of two quarks and two antiquarks
of four different flavors:
b, s, u, d, which might be a

tightly bound di-quark anti-diquark pair such as [bu][ds],
[bd][su], [su][bd], or [sd][bu], or a “molecule” of the loosely
bound B and K mesons. This Letter presents a study
of the B0
sπ± invariant mass spectrum using a data sam-
ple of 10.4 fb−1 collected with the D0 detector at the
Fermilab Tevatron collider.
The D0 detector consists of a central tracking system,
calorimeters, and muon detectors [9]. The central track-
ing system comprises a silicon microstrip tracker (SMT)
and a central fiber tracker (CFT), both located inside a
1.9 T superconducting solenoidal magnet. The tracking
system is designed to optimize tracking and vertexing for
pseudorapidities |η| < 3, where η = − ln[tan(θ/2)], and θ
is the polar angle with respect to the proton beam direc-
tion. The SMT can reconstruct the pp interaction ver-
tex (primary vertex) for interactions with at least three
tracks with a precision of 40 µm in the plane transverse
to the beam direction. The muon detector, positioned
outside the calorimeter, consists of a central muon sys-
tem covering the pseudorapidity region |η| < 1 and a
forward muon system covering the pseudorapidity region
1 < |η| < 2.
Both central and forward systems con-
sist of a layer of drift tubes and scintillators inside 1.8 T
iron toroidal magnets with two similar layers outside the
toroids.
Events used in this analysis are collected with both
single muon and dimuon triggers. Single muon triggers
require a coincidence of signals in trigger elements inside
and outside the toroidal magnets.
Dimuon triggers in
the central rapidity region require at least one muon to
penetrate the toroid. In the forward region, both muons

are required to penetrate the toroid.
Candidate events are required to include a pair of op-
positely charged muons both with pT > 1.5 GeV/c in the
invariant mass range 2.92 < m(µ+µ−) < 3.25 GeV/c2,
consistent with J/ψ decay, accompanied by two addi-
tional particles of opposite charge assumed to be kaons,
each with pT > 0.7 GeV/c, with an invariant mass of
1.012 < m(K+K−) < 1.030 GeV/c2, consistent with φ
decay, and a third charged particle with pT > 0.5 GeV/c
assumed to be a pion.
In the event selection, both muons are required to be
detected in the muon chambers inside the toroidal mag-
net, and at least one of the muons is required to be
also detected outside the iron toroid. Each muon candi-
date [10] is required to match a track found in the central
tracking system, and each of the five final-state tracks
is required to have at least one SMT hit and at least
one CFT hit. The dimuon invariant mass is constrained
to the world-average J/ψ mass [11], and the four tracks
forming a J/ψφ candidate are required to satisfy a fit to a
common vertex that is displaced from the primary vertex
in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction by at
least three times the standard deviation of the measure-
ment uncertainty. The pion candidate is required to be
consistent with originating from the primary pp collision
vertex.
To form a B0
sπ± combination, we select the B0
s
candidates in the mass range 5.303 < m(J/ψφ) <
5.423 GeV/c2, corresponding to an interval of ±2 stan-
dard deviations around the mean value of the recon-
structed B0
s mass. The m (J/ψφ) distribution is shown
in Fig. 1.
The fit, including a third-order polynomial
describing the combinatorial background and a Gaus-
sian function describing the signal, yields the Gaus-
sian signal parameters m(B0
s) = 5363.3 ± 0.6 MeV/c2,
σ(B0
s) = 31.6 ± 0.6 MeV/c2 and the number of sig-
nal events Nev = 5582 ± 100.
To improve the reso-
lution of the invariant mass of the B0
sπ± system and
to remove the measured B0
s mass bias, we define it as
m(B0
sπ±) = m(J/ψφ π±) − m(J/ψφ) + 5.3667 GeV/c2,
where m(J/ψ) is not constrained to the nominal value.
We study events as a function of mass in the range
5.5 < m (J/ψφ) < 5.9 GeV/c2.
Background in the B0
sπ± invariant mass spectrum re-
sults from random combinations of selected B0
s can-
didates with low momentum charged particles coming
mostly from the primary vertex. To suppress background
the B0
sπ± system is required to have pT > 10 GeV/c. To
further reduce background, we impose a limit on the dif-
ference between the directions of the B0
s candidate and
the pion to be ∆R =
�
∆η2 + ∆φ2 < 0.3, where η is
the pseudorapidity and φ is the azimuthal angle. In ad-
dition to increasing the signal-to-background ratio this
“cone cut” limits backgrounds that are not included in
available simulations.
The B0
s candidates include genuine B0
s mesons and the
combinatorial background under the B0
s signal, as seen
in Fig. 1. The B0
sπ± background with a real B0
s meson
is modeled using a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation [12] of
events containing a B0
s meson and additional pions tuned
to reproduce the B0
s transverse momentum distribution
in data.
The background with a false B0
s meson is modeled us-
ing the sideband events obtained from data. The chosen
sideband regions 5.0 < m(J/ψφ) < 5.21 GeV/c2 and 5.51
< m(J/ψφ) < 5.87 GeV/c2 are indicated in Fig. 1. The
sidebands are separated by ∼5σ from the B0
s nominal
mass. The left and right sideband ranges are chosen to
provide a large event sample and to have an average mass
of m(B0
s).
The two background components are found to have
similar shapes [13]. The fraction of the real B0
s events in
the signal region is obtained from the fit to the B0
s meson
in the m(J/ψφ) distribution and is found to be (70.9 ±
0.6)%. MC events and the sideband events are mixed in
this proportion to obtain the combined background that
includes pions from both sources. The event selection re-
sults in pions that mainly come from the primary vertex,
although pions originating from heavy flavor decays are
also present in the sample.
Multiple entries for a single event may occur when
more than one pion candidate passes the event selection
and they are retained in the sample. The rate of duplicate
entries in the mass range 5.5 < m(B0
sπ±) < 5.6 GeV/c2
(∼5%) is lower than for masses above 5.7 GeV/c2 (∼8%).
The combined background is modeled by a function of
the parameter m0 = mBπ − ∆, where mBπ ≡ m(B0
sπ±)
and ∆ = 5.5 GeV/c2, of the form:
Fbgr(m0) = P4(C1=0) × exp (P2) .

to zero. This empirical function gives a good description
of the combined backgrounds, as seen in Fig. 2.
The B0
sπ± invariant mass spectrum is shown in
Fig. 3(a) with the cone cut and (b) without the cone cut.
An enhancement is seen near 5.57 GeV/c2. To extract
the signal parameters, the distributions are fitted with a
function F (Eq. 2) that includes two terms: the back-
ground term Fbgr(mBπ) with fixed shape parameters as
in Fig. 2 and the signal term Fsig(mBπ, MX, ΓX), mod-
eled by a relativistic Breit-Wigner function convolved
with a Gaussian detector resolution function and with
the mass-dependent efficiency of the cone cut [13]. Here
MX and ΓX are the mass and the natural width of
the resonance.
The Gaussian width parameter σres =
3.8 MeV/c2 is taken from simulations.
The fit function has the form:
F = fsig × Fsig(mBπ, MX, ΓX) + fbgr × Fbgr(mBπ), (2)
where fsig and fbgr are normalization factors.
We use the Breit-Wigner parametrization appropriate
for an S-wave two-body decay near threshold:
BW(mBπ) ∝
M 2
XΓ(mBπ)
(M 2
X − m2
Bπ)2 + M 2
XΓ2(mBπ).
(3)
The mass-dependent width Γ(mBπ) = ΓX · (q1/q0) is
proportional to the natural width ΓX, where q1 and q0
are three-vector momenta of the B0
s meson in the rest
frame of the B0
sπ± system at the invariant mass equal to
mBπ and MX, respectively.
In the fit shown in Fig. 3a, the normalization pa-
rameters fsig and fbgr and the Breit-Wigner parame-
ters MX and ΓX are allowed to vary.
The fit yields
the mass and width of MX = 5567.8 ± 2.9 MeV/c2,
ΓX = 21.9±6.4 MeV/c2, and the number of signal events
of N = 133 ± 31. As the measured width is significantly
larger than the experimental mass resolution, we infer

significance of the signal is defined as

−2 ln(L0/Lmax),
where Lmax and L0 are likelihood values at the best-fit
signal yield and the signal yield fixed to zero. The ob-
tained local statistical significance is 6.6σ for the given
mass and width values. With the look-elsewhere effect
[14] taken into account, the global statistical significance
is 6.1σ. The search window is taken as the interval be-
tween the B0

ural width of the signal and the background mass shape

exceed background for m(Bsπ±) > MX [13]. We per-
form a fit in the restricted range m(B0
sπ±) < 5.7 GeV/c2
(Fig.
3b) and find the fitted number of signal events
to be 106 ± 23, with a corresponding local statistical
significance of 4.8σ. The difference in yields with and
without the cone cut is not fully explained by statisti-
cal fluctuations. In a subsidiary study we used empirical
functions [15] for the background fitted to the sidebands
in data below the X(5568) region and above the signal
region up to 5.9 GeV/c2 and found signal yields that
are greater than those with the default background func-
tion and comparable to or greater than that found in
the cone cut analysis. These results confirm that using
a background function that agrees with data for masses
above 5.7 GeV can increase the fitted signal yield above
that obtained using the default background model. Addi-
tional background processes not present in our MC such
as Bc → Bs nπ with n > 1, or other new states at higher
mass, would thus have the effect of reducing the X(5568)
yield for the no-cone cut case.
As a cross-check, we extract a pure B0
sπ± signal by
performing fits of the number of B0
s events in the J/ψφ
mass distribution in 20 MeV intervals in the range 5.5 <
m(B0
sπ±) < 5.9 MeV/c2. Results of those fits are shown
in Fig. 4. A fit to the dependence of resulting B0
s yields on
m(B0
sπ±), with the mass and natural width fixed to the
previously obtained values, gives 118 ± 22 signal events.
This result confirms that the observed signal is due to
B0
sπ± candidates with genuine B0
s mesons and thus elim-
inates the possibility of non-B0
s processes mimicking the
signal.
We obtain the systematic uncertainties for the mea-
sured values of the X(5568) state mass, natural width,
and the number of events. The dominant uncertainties
are due to the background and signal shapes. We eval-
uate the systematic uncertainties due to the background
shape by a) using different models of bottom pair pro-
duction in generating the B0
s MC samples, b) varying the
sideband mass intervals, c) changing the way the B0
s mass
constraint is applied in the calculation of m(B0
sπ±) for
the sideband events by replacing the mass difference de-
fined in the text by the kinetic energy obtained by forcing
m(J/ψφ) to the world-average B0
s mass, d) changing the
ratio of the MC to the sideband events within 1σ, e) using
different background functions by replacing the fourth-
order polynomial in Eq.1 with a third- or fifth-order poly-
nomial or replacing the second-order polynomial in the
exponential with the first- or third-order polynomial, and
f) varying the nominal B0
s mass within ±1 MeV/c2 in
the background samples, both for the sideband data and
simulated events. The systematic uncertainties due to
the signal shape are evaluated by a) varying the detec-
tor resolution within ±1 MeV/c2 around the mean value,
b) using a non-relativistic Breit-Wigner function, and c)
using a P-wave relativistic Breit-Wigner function.
Additionally, we estimate the systematic uncertainties
due to the binning by changing the bin size to 5 MeV/c2
and to 10 MeV/c2 instead of 8 MeV/c2, and shifting the
lower edge of the mass scale by 1/3, 1/2 and 2/3 of the bin
size. All systematic uncertainty sources are summarized
in Table 1. The uncertainties are added in quadrature
separately for positive and negative values to obtain the
total systematic uncertainties for each measured parame-
ter and are treated as nuisance parameters to construct a
prior predictive model [11, 16] of our test statistic. When
the systematic uncertainties are included, the significance
of the observed signal including the look-elsewhere effect
is reduced to 5.1σ. For the analysis without the ∆R cut
(Fig. 3b) we obtain a significance including the system-
atic uncertainty and the look-elsewhere effect of 3.9σ.
The stability of the result is checked by examining sub-
samples with a) different signs of the π± meson, b) dif-
ferent ranges of the azimuth and rapidity, c) the distance
between the B0
s vertex and the primary vertex changed to
five standard deviations, d) different B0
s mass windows
(1.7σ, 1.5σ, 1.2σ), e) different B0
sπ± momentum inter-
vals (pT > 9 GeV/c, pT > 12 GeV/c), and f) different
cone cuts (∆R < 0.2, ∆R < 0.15). Taking into account
the efficiencies of these cuts, no unexpected behaviors are
observed in these tests.
The invariant mass spectra of B0
s candidates and
charged tracks with kaon or proton mass hypotheses, are
checked and no resonant-like enhancements in these dis-
tributions are found.
We measure the ratio ρ of the yield of the new state
X(5568) to the yield of the B0
s meson in two kinematic
ranges, 10 < pT (B0
s) < 15 GeV/c and 15 < pT (B0
s) < 30
GeV/c, by repeating the m(B0
sπ) fits with free mass and
width parameters for the X(5568) signal [13]. The results
for ρ are (9.1 ± 2.6 ± 1.6)% and (8.2 ± 2.7 ± 1.6)%, re-
spectively, with an average of (8.6 ± 1.9 ± 1.4)%. The
systematic uncertainties due to B0
s reconstruction effi-
ciency cancel out in the ratio. The combined factor of the
soft pion kinematic acceptance, reconstruction efficiency,

and selection efficiency is obtained from a simulated sam-
ples of events with a spinless particle of mass equal to
5568 MeV/c2 decaying to B0
s and a charged pion. The
pion efficiency increases with pT (B0
s) from (26.1 ± 3.2)%
to (42.1 ± 6.5)% for the two pT (B0
s) ranges. The system-
atic uncertainty due to a potential difference of the soft
pion reconstruction efficiency in MC and data of ±5% is
accounted for in systematics. Within uncertainties, the
production ratio ρ does not depend on pT (B0
s).
A possible interpretation of the observed structure is a
four-quark state made up of a diquark-antidiquark pair.
With the B0
sπ+ produced in an S wave, its quantum
numbers would be JP = 0+. Thus, the state may be a
heavy analogue of the isotriplet scalar state a(980), with
an s quark replaced by a b quark. Such open charm and
open bottom scalar mesons are predicted in Ref. [17]. On
the other hand, the state can decay through the chain
B∗
sπ±, B∗
s → B0
sγ, where the low-energy photon is not
detected. In this case, the quantum numbers of this state
would be JP = 1+ that would make it a counterpart to
other heavy tetraquark candidates. The mass of the new
state would be shifted by addition of the nominal mass
difference m(B∗
s) − m(B0
s), while its width would remain
unchanged. The large difference between the mass of this
state and the sum of the Bd and K± masses implies [18]
that X(5568) is unlikely to be a molecular state com-
posed of loosely bound Bd and K± mesons.
In summary, a structure is seen in the B0
sπ± invari-
ant mass spectrum near threshold with a statistical sig-
nificance, including the look-elsewhere effect, of 6.1σ.
When the systematic uncertainties are included, the sig-
nificance of the signal is 5.1σ. For the alternate analysis
without the ∆R cut, we find the corresponding signif-
icance of 3.9σ. This structure may be interpreted as a
tetraquark state with four different valence quark flavors,
b, s, u, d. The mass and natural width of the X(5568)
state are m = 5567.8 ± 2.9 (stat)+0.9
−1.9 (syst) MeV/c2 and
Γ = 21.9 ± 6.4 (stat)+5.0
−2.5 (syst) MeV/c2.
