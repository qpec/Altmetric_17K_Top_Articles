IMPORTANCE Examining life expectancy by county allows for tracking geographic disparities
over time and assessing factors related to these disparities. This information is potentially
useful for policy makers, clinicians, and researchers seeking to reduce disparities and increase
longevity.
OBJECTIVE To estimate annual life tables by county from 1980 to 2014; describe trends in
geographic inequalities in life expectancy and age-specific risk of death; and assess the
proportion of variation in life expectancy explained by variation in socioeconomic and
race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Annual county-level life tables were constructed using
small area estimation methods from deidentified death records from the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS), and population counts from the US Census Bureau, NCHS, and the
Human Mortality Database. Measures of geographic inequality in life expectancy and
age-specific mortality risk were calculated. Principal component analysis and ordinary least
squares regression were used to examine the county-level association between life
expectancy and socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk
factors, and health care factors.
EXPOSURES County of residence.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Life expectancy at birth and age-specific mortality risk.
RESULTS Counties were combined as needed to create stable units of analysis over the period
1980 to 2014, reducing the number of areas analyzed from 3142 to 3110. In 2014, life
expectancy at birth for both sexes combined was 79.1 (95% uncertainty interval [UI],
79.0-79.1) years overall, but differed by 20.1 (95% UI, 19.1-21.3) years between the counties
with the lowest and highest life expectancy. Absolute geographic inequality in life expectancy
increased between 1980 and 2014. Over the same period, absolute geographic inequality in
the risk of death decreased among children and adolescents, but increased among older
adults. Socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and
health care factors explained 60%, 74%, and 27% of county-level variation in life expectancy,
respectively. Combined, these factors explained 74% of this variation. Most of the association
between socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors and life expectancy was mediated through
behavioral and metabolic risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Geographic disparities in life expectancy among US counties
are large and increasing. Much of the variation in life expectancy among counties can be
explained by a combination of socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and
metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. Policy action targeting socioeconomic factors
and behavioral and metabolic risk factors may help reverse the trend of increasing disparities
in life expectancy in the United States.

 S
tudies have routinely shown that life expectancy in the
United States varies geographically, in some cases
dramatically.1-3 Counties are the smallest administra-
tive unit routinely available in death registration data
and represent an opportunity to explore the extent
of geographic inequalities in the United States. In
particular, tracking inequality at the county level over
time is an important means of assessing progress
toward the goal of more equitable health outcomes,
as enshrined in the Healthy People 2020 objective:
“Achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and
improve the health of all groups.”4 Moreover, county-level
information on basic health outcomes is essential for
appropriately targeting resources and designing and
implementing health and social welfare policy at both
the federal and state level.
Previous analyses of life expectancy at the county level
have found large2,5 and increasing3 geographic disparities.
However, these analyses either excluded or combined a
large number of smaller counties, likely leading to an under-
estimation of geographic inequality. Moreover, recent
research has highlighted the need to consider age-specific
metrics of survival in addition to life expectancy overall.
Case and Deaton6 identified differential trends in mortality
rates among age groups, with middle age mortality rates
stagnating or even increasing for certain populations, while
mortality rates among older individuals continued to
decline. Similarly, Currie and Schwandt7 identified differen-
tial trends in income-based inequalities by age, with
inequalities generally declining among children and
adolescents and increasing for older ages. To our knowl-
edge, age-specific trends in geographic inequalities have
not been previously described at the county level in the
United States.
Beyond describing geographic variation in life expec-
tancy, exploring what factors explain this variation might
provide import insights into how to reduce inequalities and
achieve more equitable health outcomes. Several previous
analyses5,8,9 have used local data on all-cause mortality to
explore this question and have identified a large number of
socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and
metabolic risk factors, and health care factors that are corre-
lated with survival. However, these analyses have not sys-
tematically explored the extent to which county-level varia-
tion in life expectancy can be explained by the larger social
and economic context of a county, the behavioral and meta-
bolic risk profile of county residents, or the availability and
quality of health care.
This analysis has 3 specific aims. First, to generate
annual estimates of life expectancy and age-specific mortal-
ity risk for each county from 1980 to 2014. Second, to
quantify geographic inequalities in life expectancy and
age-specific mortality risks and to examine trends in
geographic inequality over time. Third, to assess the extent
to which variation in life expectancy is explained by
variation in socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors,
behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care
access and quality.
Methods
Small Area Models for Estimating Life Expectancy
and Age-Specific Mortality Risks
Unit of Analysis
All analyses were carried out at the county level. Counties were
combined as needed to create stable units of analysis over the
period 1980 to 2014, reducing the number of areas analyzed
from 3142 to 3110 (eTable 1 in the Supplement). For simplic-
ity, these units are referred to as “counties” throughout.
Data
Deidentified death records from the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS)10 and population counts from the census
bureau,11 NCHS,12-14 and the Human Mortality Database15 were
used in this analysis. Deaths and population were tabulated
by county, age group (0, 1-4, 5-9, …, 80-84, and ≥85), sex, and
year. County-level information on levels of education, in-
come, race/ethnicity, Native American reservations, and popu-
lation density derived from data provided by the census bu-
reau and NCHS was also incorporated (eTable 2 in the
Supplement).
Small Area Model
Previously described and validated Bayesian small area
models for estimating age-specific mortality rates by county
were used in this analysis.16 These models incorporated 7
covariates (the proportion of the adult population who
graduated high school; the proportion of the population that
is Hispanic; the proportion of the population that is black;
the proportion of the population that is a race other than
black or white; the proportion of a county that is contained
within a state or federal Native American reservation; the
median household income; and the population density) and
smooth mortality rates over space, time, and age to produce
more stable estimates of the mortality rate in each county,
year, and age group. Models were fit using the Template
Model Builder Package17 in R version 3.2.4 (R Foundation).18
County-level estimates were scaled to ensure consistency
with existing national-level estimates from the Global Bur-
den of Disease study.19
Key Points
Question Are inequalities in life expectancy among counties in
the United States growing or diminishing, and what factors can
explain differences in life expectancy among counties?
Findings In this population-based analysis, inequalities in life
expectancy among counties are large and growing, and much of
the variation in life expectancy can be explained by differences in
socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and
metabolic risk factors, and health care factors.
Meaning Policy action targeting socioeconomic factors and
behavioral and metabolic risk factors may help reverse the trend of
increasing disparities in life expectancy in the United States.

 Life Table Construction and Metrics
The method described by Wang et al20 was used to extrapo-
late mortality rates to older ages (5-year age groups up to age
110 years). Standard demographic methods were used to con-
struct period life tables for each county and year from the age-
specific mortality rates estimated by the small area model.21
Life expectancy at birth (e0) and the probability of death for 5
age groups—0 to 5 (5q0); 5 to 25 (20q5), 25 to 45 (20q25), 45 to
65 (20q45), and 65 to 85 (20q65)—were extracted from these
life tables.
For each measure, absolute geographic inequality was
quantified as the difference between the 99th and 1st percen-
tile level, and relative geographic inequality was quantified as
the ratio of the 99th to 1st percentile level. The correspond-
ing measures using the 90th and 10th percentile were calcu-
lated as well.
Analysis of County-Level Variation in Life Expectancy
Data
A cross-sectional data set was constructed of variables corre-
lated with life expectancy at the county level. To maximize the
numberofvariablesincluded,2009,theyearwiththebestdata
coverage, was used. Three groups of variables were consid-
ered. For the first group, variables related to the broader so-
cial, economic, and demographic context of a county were
identified. Specifically: the poverty rate, median household in-
come, proportion of the adult population who graduated high
school, proportion of the adult population who graduated col-
lege,theunemploymentrate,proportionofthepopulationthat
are black, proportion of the population that are native Ameri-
can, and proportion of the population that are Hispanic. For
the second group, behavioral and metabolic risk factors with
high attributable burden in the United States22 for which re-
liable estimates were available at the county level were iden-
tified. The prevalence of obesity, leisure–time physical inac-
tivity, cigarette smoking, hypertension, and diabetes were
included. For the third group, variables related to access to
health care and health care quality were identified. Three vari-
ables were ultimately included: the percentage of the popu-
lation younger than 65 years who are insured, a quality index
that is a composite of variables related to primary care access
andqualitybasedonMedicaredataanalyzedbytheDartmouth
Atlasproject,23andthenumberofphysicianspercapita.eTable
3 in the Supplement provides details about the data sources
for each of these variables.
Regression Models
A series of bivariate ordinary least squares regression models
were fitted with life expectancy at birth in 2009 as the depen-
dent variable and each of the variables listed above as inde-
pendent variables to assess the independent relationship be-
tween each of these variables and life expectancy.
Many of the variables considered were highly correlated
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement), making multivariate models
including all of these factors challenging to interpret due to
collinearity. Therefore, a principal component analysis24 was
conducted on each group of variables and the first principal
component from each (rescaled to run from 0 to 1) was used
as a composite index representing the socioeconomic and
race/ethnicity, behavioral and metabolic risk, and health
care characteristics, respectively, of each county. A series of
ordinary least squares regression models were fitted with
life expectancy at birth as the dependent variable and each
of these indices separately, and then in combination, as the
independent variable(s). For all models, the estimated model
coefficients and the adjusted and unadjusted R2 were
extracted. As a sensitivity analysis, the full multivariate
regression models using all of the factors separately were
also fitted.
Results
InequalitiesinLifeExpectancyandAge-SpecificMortalityRisk
There was considerable variation in mortality risk and life ex-
pectancy at the county level in all years. In 2014, life expec-
tancy at birth for both sexes combined at the national level was
79.1 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 79.0-79.1) years (76.7 [95%
UI, 76.7-76.8] years for men, and 81.5 [95% UI, 81.4-81.5] years
for women), but there was a 6.2-year gap (95% UI, 6.1-6.2) be-
tween the 10th and 90th percentile, a 10.7-year gap (95% UI,
10.5-11.0) between the 1st and 99th percentile, and a 20.1-
year gap (95% UI, 19.1-21.3) between the lowest and highest life
expectancy among all counties. Several counties in South and
North Dakota (typically those with Native American reserva-
tions) had the lowest life expectancy, and counties along the
lowerhalfoftheMississippiandineasternKentuckyandsouth-
western West Virginia also had very low life expectancy com-
pared with the rest of the country. In contrast, counties in cen-
tral Colorado had the highest life expectancies (Figure 1).
Geographical patterns in mortality risk for each age group were
similar, but not identical (eFigures 2-6 in the Supplement). Re-
sults by sex and for all counties and years are available in an
online visualization tool.
Between 1980 and 2014, life expectancy at birth for both
sexes combined in the United States increased by 5.3 (95% UI,
5.3-5.4) years, from 73.8 (95% UI, 73.7-73.8) to 79.1 (95% UI,
79.0-79.1) years (6.7 [95% UI, 6.7-6.8]) years, from 70.0 [95%
UI, 70.0-70.0] to 76.7 [95% UI, 76.7-76.8] for men; 3.9 [95%
UI, 3.9-4.0] years, from 77.5 [95% UI, 77.5-77.6] to 81.5 [95%
UI, 81.4-81.5] for women). This masks massive variation at the
county level; however, counties in central Colorado, Alaska,
andalongbothcoastsexperiencedmuchlargerincreases,while
some southern counties in states stretching from Oklahoma
to West Virginia saw little, if any, improvement over this same
period (Figure 2). Similarly, there was considerable variation
among counties in the percent decline in the mortality risk
within each age group (eFigure 7 in the Supplement). While
all counties experienced declines in mortality risk for chil-
dren (ages 0 to 5 years) and nearly all counties (>98%) expe-
rienced declines in the mortality risk for adolescents (ages 5
to 25 years) and older adults (ages 45 to 65 and 65 to 85 years),
a significant minority of counties (11.5%) experienced in-
creases in the risk of death between ages 25 and 45 years.
Absolute geographic inequality in life expectancy at birth
increased between 1980 and 2014, with the gap between the

 1st and 99th percentile increasing by 2.4 (95% UI, 2.1-2.7) years
(Figure 3). However, for mortality risks, this pattern varied by
age: the difference between the 1st and 99th among counties
declinedby42.9%(95%UI,40.4%-45.1%)amongchildren(ages
0 to 5 years), by 18.9% (95% UI, 15.2%-22.7%) for adolescents
(ages 5 to 25years), and increased by 10.1% (95% UI, 6.4%-
14.1%), 15.0% (95% UI, 11.6%-18.4%), and 48.2% (95% UI,
42.7%-53.7%) for age groups 25 to 45 years, 45 to 65 years, and
65 to 85 years, respectively. Relative inequality rose for all age
groups, likely due to the overall decrease in mortality risk over
this period. Similar trends were observed when comparing the
10th and 90th percentiles (eFigure 8 in the Supplement).
Factors Related to Variation in Life Expectancy
Table 1 provides summary statistics for each of the variables
included in the analysis of factors related to variation in life
expectancy as well as the bivariate regression results. Statis-
ticallysignificantrelationshipswithlifeexpectancywerefound
for each variable. Detailed results of the principal component
analysis are given in eTables 4 through 6 and eFigure 9 in the
Supplement. The first principal component explained 42%,
79%, and 56% of the total variation in socioeconomic and race/
ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and
health care factors, respectively. Table 2 lists the regression re-
sults based on these three indices. Socioeconomic and race/
ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and
health care factors, when considered independently, ex-
plained 60%, 74%, and 27%, respectively, of the county-level
variation in life expectancy. In combination, these 3 factors ex-
plained 74% of the variation. The effect size for the behav-
ioral and metabolic risk factors index is similar in the com-
bined model (Model 4) as in the model with just risk factors
as a predictor (Model 2). In contrast, the effect size for socio-
economic and race/ethnicity factors is much reduced in the
combined model (Model 4) compared with the model with just
socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors (Model 1), and is no
longer statistically significant. The effect size for health care
factors is also reduced in the combined model (Model 4) com-
pared with the model with just health care factors (Model 3),
but the effect is still statistically significant.
The corresponding results from the regressions using all
variables separately are presented in eTable 7 in the Supple-
ment. The overall amount of variation explained by each
group of factors, both separately and in combination, is

Counties in South Dakota and North Dakota had the lowest life expectancy, and
counties along the lower half of the Mississippi, in eastern Kentucky, and

the rest of the country. Counties in central Colorado had the highest life
expectancies.

 somewhat higher, but with the same ordering among the dif-

tors, 31% for health care factors, and 82% for all factors

Discussion
This study found large—and increasing—geographic dispari-
ties among counties in life expectancy over the past 35 years.
The magnitude of these disparities demands action, all the
more urgently because inequalities will only increase further
if recent trends are allowed to continue uncontested.
Thefindingthatcounty-levelgeographicinequalitiesinlife
expectancy are large and increasing is consistent with earlier
studies. Kulkarni et al2 reported a 15.2-year and 12.5-year gap
between counties with the lowest and highest life expec-
tancy in 2007 for men and women, respectively, while Wang
et al3 reported a 17.8-year and 12.3-year gap in 2010 for men
and women, respectively. This study estimates noticeably
larger disparities: in recent years, the gap in life expectancy
among counties for both sexes combined was more than 20
years. The smaller estimates in Kulkarni et al2 and Wang et al3
arelikelyduetotheiraggregationofsmallercountiesintolarger
merged county units (they analyze 2356 units compared with
3110 in this study). Chetty et al5 also estimated county-level
life expectancy for a subset of counties, with a focus on how
life expectancy varies among counties for low-income com-
pared with high-income individuals. As in this analysis, they
found substantial variation in life expectancy among coun-
ties. There are several important differences in their estima-
tion strategy as compared with the one used in this study, how-
ever. In particular, to estimate life expectancy by income level,
they use death records from the social security administra-
tion rather than from NCHS. This restricts their analysis to in-
dividuals aged 40 to 76 years who reported at least some in-
come, and introduces some uncertainty in the county of
residence for decedents who relocated after reaching retire-
ment age (62 years). Likely as a consequence of the differ-
ences in the underlying data, as well as differences in analy-
sismethods,thecorrelationbetweentheestimatesfromChetty
et al5 and this analysis was lower than might be expected: be-
tween 0.38 and 0.65, depending on sex and income quartile.

Compared with the national average, counties in central Colorado, Alaska, and

 This study expanded upon earlier analyses of county-
level variation in longevity by examining mortality risk by age
in addition to life expectancy. There were substantial geo-
graphic inequalities in the risk of death in each age group con-
sidered; however, the trajectory of inequalities over time dif-
fered by age: absolute geographic inequalities in the risk of
death declined over the study period for children and adoles-
cents, and increased for adults, especially those aged 65 to 85
years. This is broadly consistent with recent findings by Currie
and Schwandt7 who analyzed age-specific mortality rates
among counties grouped by income and found that inequal-
ity among income groups decreased for children and adoles-
cents and increased for older adults from 1990 to 2010. Fur-
ther research should focus on the drivers of these divergent
trends. It seems likely that increases in geographic inequality
in life expectancy over the past 3 decades have been driven
largelybyincreasesingeographicinequalityintheriskofdeath
in older ages. Consequently, these age groups are an espe-
cially important target for further research and intervention.
A large body of previous research documents a relation-
ship between socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors and
various measures of survival.25-28 Consistent with this re-
search, this study found that socioeconomic and race/
ethnicity factors alone explained 60% of the variation in life
expectancy. At the same time, 74% of the variation was ex-
plained by behavioral and metabolic risk factors alone, while
only marginally more variation was explained by socioeco-
nomicandrace/ethnicityfactors,behavioralandmetabolicrisk
factors, and health care factors combined. Furthermore, there
was very little additional effect of socioeconomic and race/
ethnicity factors when accounting for all 3 sets of factors si-
multaneously, suggesting that the association between life ex-
pectancy and socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors at the
county level is largely mediated through behavioral and meta-
bolic risk factors.
Previousstudies8,9examiningtherelationshipbetweenso-
cioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and meta-
bolic risk factors, and/or health care factors and some mea-
sure of survival at a substate level in the United States are not
directly analogous because they use different measures of sur-
vival, different explanatory factors, and more aggregated geo-
graphic units or a subset of larger counties, but certain find-
ings can still be compared. Cullen et al8 examined the
relationship between 22 socioeconomic and environmental
variables and the sex-specific and race-specific probability of
survival to age 70 years in 510 groups of counties. Consistent
with the results of this study, they found that a large propor-
tion of the variation in survival among counties could be ex-

 plained by these variables (72%-86%, depending on the sex
and race). Furthermore, in a small subset of larger counties,
they found that additionally considering 8 risk and health care
factors increased the amount of variation explained to 86% to
90%. Davids and Jones9 assessed the relationship between
county-level life expectancy and a small set of socioeco-
nomic and race factors (poverty, no high school diploma, black
race) and metabolic risk factors (diabetes and hypertension
prevalence). As in this study, Davids and Jones9 found an in-
verse relationship between life expectancy and markers of low
socioeconomic status and metabolic risk factors. Their find-
ings differ from ours, however, in that the effect of the socio-
economic and race factors was only slightly attenuated when
consideringriskfactorsconcurrently,althoughthismaybedue
to the much smaller number of factors considered.
The findings on factors related to variation in life expec-
tancy have important policy implications. In particular, poli-
ciesandprogramsthattargetbehavioralandmetabolicriskfac-
tors have the potential to improve health in all locations but
especially those that are currently most at a disadvantage, con-
sequently reducing geographic disparities. This is not to say
that policies that target socioeconomic drivers of disparities
would not also be effective, but rather that there are multiple
potential routes to more equitable health outcomes for fed-
eral, state, and local policy makers to consider. Furthermore,
researchers now recognize that the relationship between so-
cioeconomic status and health likely reflects causal path-
waysrunninginbothdirections(ie,frombetterhealthtohigher
socioeconomicstatusaswellasfromhighersocioeconomicsta-
tus to better health).29 Thus, policies that target inequalities

risk factors, and health care factors, both independently and in
combination.
Limitations
This analysis also has a number of limitations. The deaths,
population, and covariates data used as the basis for estimat-
ing life expectancy by county are all subject to error. The small
areamodelsaredesignedtosmoothacrosscounties,years,and
age groups and may in some cases over-smooth, resulting in
an underestimation of geographic inequalities. This study
documented increasing geographic inequality in life expec-
tancy among counties but did not assess the extent to which
these trends are a reflection of increasing inequality among in-
dividuals as opposed to changes in the geographic distribu-
tion of low-risk and high-risk individuals as a result of differ-
entialmigration(eg,increasingsegregationoflowandhighrisk
populations).30 In the regression analysis of factors related to
county-level variation in life expectancy, the outcome vari-
able (life expectancy) as well as the socioeconomic and race/
ethnicityvariables,behavioralandmetabolicriskvariables,and
health care variables, are subject to measurement error. More-
over, all of the risk factor variables are themselves based on
models that incorporated some socioeconomic factors as co-
variates,whichmayinduceadditionalcorrelationbetweenrisk
and socioeconomic factors in the regression analysis—this is
unlikely to have a substantial effect however, because the re-
lationship between risk factors and socioeconomic factors in
the risk factor small area models is not imposed, but rather es-
timated from the data. A relatively small number of variables
were used to represent the overall socioeconomic and race/
ethnicity, behavioral and metabolic risk, and health care char-
acteristics of a county, and consequently have likely not cap-
tured all relevant factors within each of these groups. There
are also likely factors outside of these 3 categories that are re-
lated to geographic inequality but that were not considered in
this analysis. The regression analysis is cross-sectional and can
beusedtodrawconclusionsaboutassociationsbutnotwhether
these associations are causal. Similarly, it cannot be used to
assess the extent to which increasing geographic inequality in
life expectancy among counties is due to change in the fac-
tors considered in the regression analysis. Furthermore, if so-
cioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and meta-
bolic risk factors, and health care factors are causally related
to life expectancy, this effect almost certainly plays out over
the life course. However, the regression analysis only incor-
porates contemporaneous information about life expec-
tancy, and these other factors and a county’
s current status in
terms of socioeconomic and race/ethnicity, behavioral and
metabolic risk, and health care factors may not perfectly rep-
resent the lifetime experience of individuals currently living
and dying in that county.
Conclusions
Geographic disparities in life expectancy among counties are
large and increasing. Much of the variation in life expectancy
among counties can be explained by a combination of socio-
economic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and meta-
bolic risk factors, and health care factors. Policy action target-
ing socioeconomic factors and behavioral and metabolic risk
factors may help reverse the trend of increasing disparities in
life expectancy in the United States.
