In recent years, metabolic syndromes (MetSs), including diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular diseases,
have become a common health problem in both developed and developing countries. Accumulating data have
suggested that traditional herbs might be able to provide a wide range of remedies in prevention and treatment
of MetSs. Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe, Zingiberaceae) has been documented to ameliorate hyperlipidemia,
hyperglycemia,oxidativestress,andinflammation.Thesebeneficialeffectsaremediatedbytranscriptionfactors,such
as peroxisome proliferator–activated receptors, adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase, and nuclear
factor �B. This review focuses on recent findings regarding the beneficial effects of ginger on obesity and related
complications in MetS and discusses its potential mechanisms of action. This review provides guidance for further
applications of ginger for personalized nutrition and medicine.

Introduction
Over the years, diverse definitions for metabolic
syndrome (MetS) have been published by different
health organizations. What is clear is that MetS is
defined by a constellation of interconnected physio-
logical, biochemical, clinical, and metabolic factors
linked to an increased risk of abdominal obesity,
hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, inflammation, and
hypertension that raise the risks of nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease
(CVD), and diabetes.1 MetS is a growing health
problem that has reached pandemic proportions, as
it now affects a quarter of the world’s population.2
Increasing attention has been directed toward
finding effective strategies to detect, treat, and
control the comorbidities associated with MetS.
In recent years, there has been a growing interest
in exploiting the potential of natural phytochemi-
cals and plant-derived foods for restoring metabolic
balance.3 Avarietyofnaturalplants(e.g.,vegetables,
fruits, and herbs), active ingredients derived from
plants (e.g., phytochemicals, fibers, and unsaturated
fatty acids), and other natural dietary compounds
have been used to help counteract obesity-related
metabolic dysfunction.4 Ginger (Zingiber officinale
Roscoe,Zingiberaceae)isoneofthemostwidelycon-
sumed spices and/or medicinal herbs worldwide.
From its origin in Southeast Asia and its spread to
Europe, ginger has a long history of use as an herbal
medicine to treat a variety of ailments.5 Ginger con-
tains various phytochemicals and biologically active
compounds, such as phenolics and flavonoids.6
Among the identified components, gingerols and
shogaols have been found to be the major bioactive
compounds in ginger. 6-Gingerol is the major gin-
gerol, and several gingerols of various chain lengths
(n6–n10) are also present in ginger.7 Shogaols,
the dehydrated form of gingerols, are mainly con-
tained in semidried and thermally treated ginger
as a degradation product of the thermally labile

gingerols.8 They have shown numerous pharma-
cological benefits, including improvement of blood
glucose tolerance,9 enhancement of lipid profile,10
and modulation of inflammatory factors.11 This
review focuses on the recent findings regarding the
beneficial effects of ginger and its active compounds
inthefieldofpreventionandtherapyofsomeMetSs,
such as diabetes, NAFLDs, and CVDs, and discusses
the underlying mechanisms of action.
Preventive effects of ginger on metabolic
diseases
Obesity
Obesity is a serious health problem because of an
imbalance between energy intake and expenditure
that results in excessive energy stored as triglyc-
erides in adipose tissue.12 The prevalence of obe-
sity is increasing at an alarming rate around the
world. As World Health Organization (WHO) data
show, nearly two billion people are overweight, and
one-third of them are obese.13 The use of natural
materials has been considered an effective tool for
obesity control. Among them, ginger has shown the
most significant antiobesity effects in in vitro and
vivo studies (Tables 1 and 2). It was observed that
oral administration of ginger extract significantly
reduced body weights and serum lipid levels in rats
fed a high-fat diet (HFD).14 Furthermore, it was
found that ginger extract attenuated HFD-induced
obesity by increasing skeletal muscle fat catabolism
and energy expenditure.15 In particular, 6-gingerol,
one of the major active compounds of ginger, exhib-
ited antiobesity effects by altering the activities
and expressions of some lipid metabolism marker
enzymes, such as fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-
coA carboxylase, HMG co-A reductase, lecithin
choline acyl transferase, and lipoprotein lipase.16
In addition, 6-gingerol suppressed the activity of
amylase and pancreatic lipase, leading to a reduc-
tion of plasma and tissue lipids.10,17 The antiobesity
effects of ginger may be associated with its anti-
inflammatory properties. The studies have shown
that ginger extract and 6-gingerol can significantly
downregulate mRNA levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6)
and tumor necrosis factor � (TNF-�) in adipose
tissue of male rats fed a HFD.15,16
Adipogenesis constitutes a complex process of
cell differentiation by which preadipocytes become
adipocytes. Itwas reportedthat6-gingerolcaneffec-
tively inhibit the differentiation of preadipocytes
into adipocytes and prevent triglyceride deposi-
tion. It also prevented lipid accumulation and
lowered the protein expression of adipogenesis-
related transcription factors and the key lipogenic
enzymes in 3T3-L1 cells.18,19 6-Shogaol, another
major bioactive constituent in ginger, has signifi-
cantly higher effects on inhibiting adipogenesis of
3T3-L1 preadipocytes and decreasing expression of
various adipogenic/lipogenic marker proteins.20 In
addition, an analysis of cellular respiration revealed
that cultured skeletal muscle myotubes pretreated
with ginger extract increased the palmitate-induced
oxygen consumption rate, leading to an increase in
cellular fatty acid catabolism.14
Despite the in vitro and animal experiments
described above, only a few clinical trials performed
on ginger are available for MetSs. This lack of clin-
ical studies may be attributed to numerous fac-
tors, including ethical issues, limited commercial
support, and the complex chemical composition
of ginger.8 The effects of ginger supplementation
on some obesity-associated indices and metabolic
risk factors in overweight humans are listed in
Table 3. For example, an early study showed that
dietary intake of ginger could enhance thermoge-
nesis and reduce feelings of hunger.21 Moreover,
ginger supplementation showed a beneficial effect
on weight loss and some obesity-associated param-
eters in overweight and obese adults.22,23Therefore,
further research is needed to explore the potential
application of ginger for weight management.
Diabetes
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a complex metabolic
disease associated with impaired insulin secretion,
developing insulin resistance, and � cell dysfunc-
tion that leads to abnormal glucose, protein, and
lipid metabolism, inflammatory responses, and
damage.65 The majority of diabetes cases fall into
two broad categories: type 1 DM (T1DM), caused
by destruction of the pancreatic � cells resulting in
lack of insulin secretion, and type 2 DM (T2DM),
caused by insulin resistance and impaired insulin
secretion leading to high blood insulin levels and
hyperlipidemia. Of these two types, the latter is the
more prevalent form and generally receives more
attention. To date, a number of studies have demon-
strated that ginger extract can exert beneficial effects
on serum glucose and tissue glycogen content in
alloxan-induced39

streptozotocin-induced

diabetic animal models40–42,44–47 through enhanc-
ing the peripheral utilization of glucose, regulating
the activities of glycolytic enzymes, and limiting
gluconeogenic formation.45 Ginger extract could
increase the activities of glycolytic enzymes, which
drives the metabolic degradation of glucose to
form pyruvate.45 Moreover, the protective effects
of ginger on the development of diabetes have
been investigated in a high-fat/high-carbohydrate
(HFHC) diet–fed rat model, and the results showed
that ginger extract significantly improved the
insulin sensitivity using the homeostatic model
assessment of insulin resistance.29
As oxidative stress plays a key role in insulin
resistance and � cell dysfunction, it is considered
the pathogenesis of DM and its complications.
Recent studies indicated that ginger and its bioac-
tive components exerted a therapeutic protective
effect in diabetes by regulating oxidative stress
markers and decreasing activities of antioxidant
enzymes.25,43,44,46,47 Furthermore, it was demon-
strated that 6-gingerol could protect pancreatic
� cells from oxidative stress by reducing the
artificial
d-glyceraldehyde–induced
increase
in
the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)
level in RIN-5F cells.48 On the other hand, it is
generally accepted that inflammation is usually
associated with the pathogenesis of T2DM. Ginger
has shown significant anti-inflammatory properties
in amelioration of fructose-induced adipose tissue
insulin resistance, probably owing to its capacity
to suppress adipose macrophage–related proin-
flammatory cytokines.38 As a treatment, 6-gingerol
could inhibit the expression of proinflammatory
cytokines, such as TNF-� and IL-6, which demon-
strated that ginger mat exert its hypoglycemic effects
via controlling inflammation.25,48 Apart from 6-
gingerol, the other constituents of ginger, such as
12-dehydrogingerdione and 6-shogaol, also exhibit
antioxidant
and
anti-inflammatory
properties,
which significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide-
stimulated production of nitric oxide (NO) and
suppressed
mRNA
levels
of
cytokines
(IL-6,
IL-8) in RAW 264.7 cells.32,33 Moreover, ginger
extracts showed a significant inhibitory effect
on carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes, such as
�-glucosidase and �-amylase, in in vitro studies.
This may help to reduce the intestinal absorption
of
carbohydrates,
enhance
insulin
sensitivity,
and contribute to antihyperglycemic effects.30
In addition, several cell-based experiments have
also shown beneficial effects of ginger and its
active ingredients on glucose regulation. In mouse
myoblast and skeletal muscle cells, both ginger
extract and 6-gingerol can enhance glucose uptake
and promote mitochondrial biogenesis, resulting in
alleviation of insulin resistance.9,26,28,29 The results
obtained in in vivo and vitro studies indicated
that ginger extract and its major pungent phenolic
compounds possessed the ability to modulate
glucose metabolism effectively (Fig. 1).
In recent years, several clinical trials have
demonstrated that ginger treatment can reduce
levels of blood glucose and inflammation in

diabetic patients (Table 3).60,61,66 The consumption
of ginger significantly improved insulin sensitivity
and glucose homeostasis.59,62 Additionally, ginger
exhibited beneficial effects on blood pressure and
endothelial function in T2DM patients.64 These
results mean that ginger could be useful in improv-
ing glucolipid metabolism and the treatment of
diabetic complications.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
NAFLD is a metabolic stress, and its prevalence is
rapidly increasing owing to strong association with
obesity, dyslipidemia, T2DM, and hypertension.67
Several factors (hepatic lipid accumulation, oxida-
tive stress, and inflammation) are involved in the
pathologic metabolic mechanisms that ultimately
lead to the accumulation of liver fat and NAFLD
progression.57 Ginger has been reported to have sig-
nificant anti-NAFLD effects in both in vivo and in
vitro studies. The ethanolic extract of ginger can
ameliorate fructose-induced fatty liver and sup-
press hepatic de novo lipogenesis in rats.56 Another
experiment showed that 6-gingerol could protect
against HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and related
metabolic disorders by decreasing the induction
of inflammatory cytokines.35 In a methionine and
choline-deficient (MCD) diet–induced steatohep-
atitis animal model, 6-gingerol was able to reg-
ulate the expression of key genes related to lipid
metabolism and inflammation and showed an
inhibitory effect on hepatic steatosis.36
In vitro studies demonstrated that preincubation
with 6-gingerol significantly attenuated the accu-
mulationoflipidsandalleviatedtheoverproduction
of cellular fatty drops and inflammatory cytokines
in HepG2 cells.35,36 Furthermore, 6-gingerol could
potentially protect against IL-1�–induced inflam-
mation and oxidative stress in human hepato-
cyte (HuH-7) cells.31 In primary hepatic cells, it
was observed that ginger could significantly reduce
intracellularROSaccumulationtopreventcelldeath
and liver injury.34
Besides the laboratory results, a clinical trial
also demonstrated that ginger supplementation
resulted in a significant reduction in alanine amino-
transferase, �-glutamyl transferase, inflammatory
cytokines, and the insulin resistance index and hep-
atic steatosis grade in comparison with placebo.63
Overall, current data provide strong evidence that
ginger and its active components possess beneficial
effects that may contribute to the management of
NAFLD.
Cardiovascular disease
CVDs appear as important causes of morbidity
and mortality in both developed and developing
countries. Aside from genetic causes, CVDs are
usually associated with several risk factors, such
as high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, inflammation,
atherosclerosis, and abdominal obesity. Several
studies have suggested that consumption of ginger
and ginger-derived bioactive agents are associated
with decreased risk of CVDs.49,52,53,58 Hyperlipi-
demia, which is characterized by increased plasma
triglycerideconcentrationandloweredhigh-density
lipoprotein cholesterol, is one of the major risk
factors for the development of the progression of
atherosclerosis and its associated CVDs. It was
found that ginger extract significantly lowered
plasma triglycerides and cholesterol in both an
HFD-fed rat model48 and a hypercholesterolemic
rat model.51,68 Oxidative modification of LDL is
thought to be key to the pathogenesis of atheroscle-
rosis. It was found that the antiatherogenic effect
of ginger was associated with a significant reduc-
tion in plasma cholesterol levels and a significant
reduction in the LDL basal oxidative state, as well as
their susceptibility to oxidation and aggregation in
apolipoprotein E–deficient (E0) mice.49 In addition,

6-shogaol could prevent the oxidized LDL–induced

Angiotensin-1-converting enzyme (ACE) is a
powerful vasodilator that plays critical roles in the
regulation of vascular tone and cardiac functions.52
An increase in ACE activity is believed to influence
the development of hypertension. The antihyperc-
holesterolemic properties of ginger were observed
in a high cholesterol–fed rat model.52 The activities
of some key enzymes, such as ACE and arginase,
were inhibited, and a concomitant increase in NO
level was observed.54 Simultaneously, the antihyper-
tensive effect of ginger was also associated with the
platelet hyperactivity55 and potential neuroprotec-
tive effects.69

lipid disorders, lowering plasma cholesterol levels,
preventing hypertension, and improving endothe-
lial function contribute to the prevention of cardio-
vascular and metabolic disorders.
Signaling pathways modulating lipid
and glucose metabolism by ginger
Recently, ginger has been shown to ameliorate
obesity, diabetes, NAFLD, CVDs, and related
metabolic disorders via different mechanisms, such
as improvement of blood lipid profiles, alleviation
of insulin resistance, normalization of blood glucose
levels, and inhibition of oxidative stress and inflam-
mation. The molecular mechanisms responsible
for the observed hypolipidemic and hyperglycemic
activities of ginger probably involve its capac-
ity to inhibit mediators and transcription factors,
such as peroxisome proliferator–activated recep-
tors (PPARs), adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–
activatedproteinkinase(AMPK),andnuclearfactor
�B (NF-�B; Fig. 2).
PPARs signaling pathway
The PPARs, transcription factors of the nuclear hor-
mone receptor superfamily, are the main regulators
of many genes involved in cellular lipid homeostasis,
adipocyte differentiation, and insulin regulation.70
There are three members of the PPAR family: �,
�, and �. While PPAR-� is present in the liver and
PPAR-� is highly active in skeletal muscle, PPAR-�
isprimarilyexpressedinadiposetissue.Recentstud-
ies indicated that PPARs are the major mediators of
the antiobesity and antidiabetic effects of ginger and
its constituent compounds. In adipocytes, PPAR-�

and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein � (C/EBP-
�) are the key transcription regulator genes involved
in adipogenesis. Studies in 3T3-L1 cells showed
that 6-gingerol effectively suppressed adipogene-
sis through significant downregulation of PPAR-
� and C/EBP-� and inhibited their subsequent
transactivation of adipocyte-specific genes, such as
adipocyte-specific fatty acid binding protein (aP2),
and lipogenic enzymes like FAS, which are relevant
to lipid accumulation and lipid metabolism. Mean-
while, 6-gingerol could inhibit adipocyte differenti-
ation by attenuating the Akt/GSK-3� pathway18 and
activating the Wnt/�-catenin signaling pathway.19
6-Shogaol reduced the expression of PPAR-�-
associated genes and reduced adipogenesis in the
same cell line.20 PPAR-� is always activated by
SREBP-1c, which is a crucial lipogenic transcription
factor.SREBP-1cplaysakeyroleinlipidmetabolism
in adipose tissue by regulating the expression of
enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis. Oral treat-
ment with 6-gingerol significantly downregulated
the adipogenesis gene expression levels of PPAR-
� and SREBP-1c and modulated the expression of
lipid marker enzymes and inflammatory markers in
HFD-induced obese rats.16 Carbohydrate response
element–binding protein (ChREBP) plays a crit-
ical role in converting excess carbohydrates into
triglycerides; inhibition of ChREBP can improve
hepatic steatosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and insulin
resistance.71 It was found that ginger supplemen-
tation could ameliorate fructose-induced fatty liver
and hypertriglyceridemia in rats by modulation of
the hepatic ChREBP-mediated pathway instead of
thePPAR-� pathway.56 Theseresultswereattributed
to the tissue-specific regulation of the lipogenic pro-
tein/genes by ginger treatment.
PPAR-� is a major transcriptional regulator of
energy metabolism in skeletal muscle. The activa-
tion of PPAR-� has been shown to induce fatty acid
oxidation and can be regarded as a promising strat-
egy to ameliorate obesity. It was demonstrated that
dietary supplementation with ginger extract could
attenuate diet-induced obesity in mice by increasing
energy expenditure via PPAR-� signaling in mice.
The underlying mechanism in vitro suggests that
6-shogaol and 6-gingerol in ginger may serve as
PPAR-� agonists with subsequent effects on energy
homeostasis in skeletal muscle.14
PPAR-� is mainly characterized in the liver,
where it controls lipid homeostasis by regulat-
ing the expression of genes involved in fatty acid
transport and oxidation, hence lowering plasma
levels of triglycerides.72 In a methionine- and
choline-deficient diet–induced hepatosteatosis ani-
mal model, 6-gingerol presented a repressive effect
on hepatic steatosis, which was associated with the
induction of PPAR-�.73 In short, the results of
recent studies appear to support the view that the

Beneficial effects of ginger in metabolic syndrome
regulation of PPARs by ginger is one of the main
pathways linked to therapeutic areas related to lipid
and glucose metabolism and inflammation, such as
T2DM, obesity, and NAFLD.
AMPK signaling pathway
AMPK is an enzyme that plays an important role
in cellular and whole-body energy homeostasis.
AMPK is activated upon phosphorylation at threo-
nine 172 (Thr172) of its �-subunit.9 The activation
of AMPK� is accompanied by the upregulation
of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor �
coactivator 1-�(PGC-1�), which plays a key role
in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis in tissues
with active oxidative metabolism. Recently, in an
HFHC diet–fed rat model of MetS, ginger extract
treatment significantly improved insulin sensitivity
by enhancing AMPK� phosphorylation and total
AMPK� in skeletal muscle tissue. The further in
vitro mechanistic study showed that 6-gingerol
could increase AMPK� activation and PGC-1�
gene expression and promoted mitochondrial bio-
genesis in L6 myotubes.29 These results suggested
that the beneficial effects of ginger on modulating
glucose metabolism are probably associated with
the molecules mediated by energy-sensing, such as
AMPK.
The activation of AMPK also increases glucose
uptake by promoting glucose transporter (GLUT4)
tothecellmembrane.GLUT4translocationinvolves
the binding of insulin to insulin receptor and
the subsequent activation of phosphatidylinositol-
3 kinase (PI3K) and Akt.48 It was found that gin-
ger extract and 6-gingerol enhanced glucose uptake
with associated activation of AMPK�-subunit in
cultured L6 skeletal muscle cells.27 Findings also
implied that the ethyl acetate extract of ginger and
6-gingerol stimulated glucose uptake through pro-
motion of GLUT4 translocation via AMPK acti-
vation in L6 myotubes26,46 and hepatocyte cells.25
An in vivo study recently confirmed that 6-gingerol
has significant potential to enhance the activa-
tion of AMPK� and PGC-1� in the regulation of
lipid profiles in diet-induced obesity. 6-Gingerol
plays an important role in glucose metabolism via
the AMPK�2-mediated AS160–Rab5 pathway and
through insulin-mediated glucose regulation.9
NF-κB signaling pathway
Overnutrition-induced chronic inflammation is
a key contributor to the pathogenesis of insulin
resistance and MetS. NF-�B is the master regulator
of the inflammatory response. When cells are
exposed to proinflammatory stimuli, NF-�B is
activated and migrates to the cell nucleus, where it
directs transcription of target genes, including genes
encoding cytokines, chemokines, and the enzyme
cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2).18 COX2 is responsible
for production of prostaglandins in response to
inflammation and promotes the production of
proinflammatory cytokines.31
Different studies
have shown that ginger suppress inflammation
through inhibition of the classical NF-�B pathway
in various cell types and tissues.24,33,74 It was
shown that ginger treatment could decrease the
expression of cytokine genes (TNF-� and IL-6) in
the liver of HFD-fed rats, which was associated with
suppression of NF-�B activation. A further in vitro
study demonstrated that ginger could suppress
NF-�B activation by attenuating signaling through
the IKK/I�B�/NF-�B classical pathway.11
Gingerols, as well as other active compounds,
are major foci of research related to the anti-
inflammatory effects of ginger. It was found
that 6-gingerol protects against hepatic inflamma-
tion, which underlies the pathogenesis of chronic
diseases, such as insulin resistance and type 2
DM, through inhibition of the ROS-activated NF-
�B/COX2pathway.31 6-Gingerolalsosuppressedthe
upregulation of nuclear NF-�B DNA-binding activ-
ity in the livers of MCD diet–fed mice, suggesting
that the anti-inflammatory effect of 6-gingerol on
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is mediated, in part,
through the NF-�B signaling pathway.36 Moreover,
6-gingerol could attenuate HFD-induced hepatic
inflammation and insulin resistance by decreasing
the induction of inflammatory cytokines via an NF-
�B-dependentpathway.35 Takentogether,theresults
above revealed that ginger, as an anti-inflammatory
agent, played an essential role in protecting against
hepatic inflammation through the activation of NF-
�B, which underlies the pathogenesis of chronic dis-
eases, such as type 2 DM and nonalcoholic steato-
hepatitis.
Conclusions
Epidemiological and clinical studies from recent
years have built a consensus that ginger and its
major constituents exert beneficial effects against
obesity, diabetes, CVDs, and related disorders, more
commonly referred to as MetS. These effects are

mediated through regulation of lipid metabolism;
suppression of carbohydrate digestion; modulation
of insulin secretion and response; inhibition of
oxidative stress; enhancement of anti-inflammatory
activities; and antihyperlipidemic, hypotensive, and
antiatherosclerotic mechanisms (Fig. 1). The regu-
lation of mediators and transcription factors, such
as PPARs, AMPK, and NF-�B, contribute to the
therapeutic effects of ginger (Fig. 2). Except for ani-
mal models and in vitro cell studies, many clinical
studies have been conducted on humans to eval-
uate the beneficial effects of ginger (Tables 1–3).
However, further studies are advocated to evaluate
the effects of ginger and its main components in
human subjects in the prevention and/or treatment
of metabolic disorders.
