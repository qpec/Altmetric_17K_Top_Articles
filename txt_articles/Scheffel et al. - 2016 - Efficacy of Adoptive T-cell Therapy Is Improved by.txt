Abstract
Although adoptive transfer of autologous tumor antigen–
specific T-cell immunotherapy can produce remarkable clinical
efficacy, most patients do not achieve durable complete
responses. We hypothesized that reducing susceptibility of T
cells to activation-induced cell death (AICD), which increases
during the rapid in vitro expansion of therapeutic T cells before
their infusion, might improve the persistence of adoptively
transferred cells. Our investigations revealed that repetitive
stimulation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) induced AICD, as a
result of activating the DNA damage response pathway
through ATM-mediated Ser15 phosphorylation of p53. Acti-
vation of this DNA damage response pathway also occurred
upon
antigen-specific
restimulation
in
TCR-transduced
TIL1383I T cells prepared for adoptive transfer to patients as
part of a clinical trial. Notably, treatment with the antioxidant
N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) significantly reduced upregulation of
the DNA damage marker gH2AX, subsequent ATM activation,
and cell death. In the Pmel mouse model of melanoma, the
presence of NAC during ex vivo T-cell expansion improved the
persistence of adoptively transferred cells, reduced tumor
growth, and increased survival. Taken together, our results
offer a preclinical proof of concept for the addition of NAC
to current therapeutic T-cell expansion protocols, offering
immediate potential to improve the quality and therapeutic
efficacy of adoptive T-cell therapeutics infused into patients.

Introduction
Metastatic melanoma continues to increase both in incidence
rates and in mortality. Traditional standard-of-care for metastatic,
stage IV melanoma has a 5-year survival rate of only 15.2%,
whereas rates for clinical trials utilizing the adoptive transfer of
autologous, melanoma-specific T cells are upward of 40% (1, 2).
In the process of adoptive cell therapy (ACT), melanoma-specific
T cells are derived either from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
(TIL) cultured from a surgical resection of the tumor or from
patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) engineered
with a melanoma-specific T-cell receptor (TCR). To generate
sufficient cells for patient infusion, therapeutic T cells are activated
and rapidly expanded prior to reinfusion into a lymphodepleted
patient (3).
The
disparity
between
responding
and
nonresponding
patients following ACT has been shown to correlate with the
persistence of the cells after transfer (4). One of the factors that
may contribute to poor persistence is activation-induced cell
death (AICD). AICD, which is induced upon repetitive stimu-
lation of the TCR, is a necessary mechanism of peripheral
tolerance restricting the scope of an immune response toward
escalation into a host damaging pathology (5). However, in the
context of melanoma immunotherapy, premature deletion of
therapeutic T cells through AICD would be detrimental. T cells
that have been subjected to the intense polyclonal TCR stim-
ulation during a rapid expansion protocol (REP) are more
sensitive to AICD when cocultured with melanoma tumor cells
in vitro (6), whereas younger, less differentiated T cells, which
are less susceptible to AICD, are superior at in vivo tumor
control (7–9). As strategies that increase resistance to AICD
may bolster the durability of therapeutic T cells leading to
enhanced antitumor efficacy, a more precise understanding of
the pathways governing AICD is merited.
In this study, we show that TCR restimulation results in
increased expression of the double-strand DNA damage mar-
kers gH2AX and p-SMC-1, activation of ATM, as well as
phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of p53. Activation
of this signaling cascade was significantly inhibited by the
antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and ex vivo culture of
T cells in NAC improved outcomes in a preclinical animal
model.

 Materials and Methods
Cells, activation, and culture
Normal healthy donor apheresis cells were purchased from
Key Biologics, Inc., or Research Blood Components. Cells from
melanoma patients were obtained with consent as part of an
Institutional review board- and FDA-approved clinical trial
(NCT01586403). PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll density gradient,
activated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (5 mg/mL), and anti-CD28
(2 mg/mL) for 3 days, washed, and cultured in Iscove's modified
Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/mL
rIL2 (Peprotech), and 10 ng/mL rIL15 (Shenandoah), for at least 5
days prior to TCR restimulation. Alternatively, patient PBMCs for
the clinical trial were activated with 50 ng/mL anti-human CD3
antibody (OKT3) for 2 to 3 days and transduced with either a
lenti- or retrovirus by spinoculation on retronectin-coated plates.
The viral construct expressed TIL1383I TCR and truncated CD34
as a marker of expression (10). Transduced cells were cultured for
several days, purified on the basis of CD34 expression (Clini-
MACs) using CD34þ reagent, and placed back in culture for
several more days until undergoing a secondary REP (3). For
Pmel studies, a single-cell suspension of splenocytes was prepared
from Pmel-1 TCR transgenic mice. Cells were cultured in RPMI
supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL rIL2, and stimulated
with 1 mg/mL of gp10025–33 peptide (AnaSpec) with or without
10 mmol/L NAC. Melanoma cell lines (human MEL624 and
MEL624-28 and murine B16F10 cells) were obtained in 2013
from Drs. Michael Nishimura (Loyola University, Maywood, IL)
and Mark Rubinstein (Medical University of South Carolina,
Charleston, SC). All cells were periodically verified to be free of
mycoplasma contamination. In addition, B16F10 cells were
authenticated and confirmed to be free of rodent pathogens by
Dr. Rubinstein.
Flow cytometry
For detection of cell death, cells were washed in FACS Buffer
(PBS w/5% FBS), surface stained for 30 minutes on ice, washed
twice in Annexin V binding buffer (10 mmol/L HEPES,
140 mmol/L NaCl, 2.5 mmol/L CaCl2, pH 7.4) and incubated
with Annexin V-Cy5 (BioVision) for 15 minutes prior to acqui-
sition. Cells were surface stained and gated as follows: CD8þ for
human PBMC, CD34þCD8þ or CD34þCD4þ for TIL1383I
TCR–transduced cells, and Vb13þCD8þ for Pmel cells. For
subsequent intracellular staining with phospho-specific fluor-
ochromes, surface stained cells were fixed in 2% prewarmed
(37�C) paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes, washed, and per-
meabilized with 90% ice-cold methanol for 30 minutes prior to
incubation with antibody. Antibodies were p53-PE (BD Phar-
mingen), p-p53Ser15-Alexa Fluor 488 (Cell Signaling Technol-
ogy), p-ATMSer1981-PE, gH2AX-PerCP, p-SMC-1-Alexa Fluor
488 (EMD Millipore), and gH2AX-FITC (BioLegend, for Pmel
cells). Intracellular staining of Pmel cells with granzyme B
antibody (PE/Cy7 conjugated; eBioscience) was performed
using the transcription factor staining buffer set (eBioscience)
according to vendor protocol. Cells were acquired using the BD
LSRFortessa cell analyzer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using
FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.).
For ImageStream experiments, cells were stained with
250 ng/mL Hoechst (Acros Organics) prior to antibody stain-
ing. Samples were acquired on the Amnis ImageStream and
data were analyzed on IDEAS software (Amnis Corporation) to
determine the similarity score between Hoechst and p53 or p-
p53Ser15. Events with a similarity score of �1 were defined as
positive for colocalization.
Adoptive cell transfer
All animal experiments were performed with approval by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Medical
University of South Carolina. Eight-week-old female C57BL/6
wild-type mice (NCI) were subcutaneously injected with 3 � 105
B16F10 murine melanoma cells. Tumors were measured using
calipers and tumor area (mm2) calculated by multiplying the
length and width of two perpendicular measurements. Mice were
randomized into treatment groups to ensure equal distribution in
tumor size at initiation of the experiment. One day prior to
adoptive cell transfer, mice were lymphodepleted through total
body irradiation (5 Gy, nonmyeloablative). Pmel cells (2 � 106)
cultured in the absence or presence of 10 mmol/L NAC were
adoptively transferred via retro-orbital injection. To determine
persistence of transferred Pmel cells in circulation, blood samples
were collected from the tail vein 5 days after transfer. For biodis-
tribution analysis, mice were sacrificed 6 days after adoptive
transfer. Spleens and tumors were processed into single-cell
suspensions by mechanical dissociation. Tumors were further
digested in 1 mg/mL Collagenase II (Sigma) for 30 minutes and
TILs were isolated by density gradient separation with Histopaque
1083 (Sigma).
Statistical analysis
Linear longitudinal regression, estimated using generalized
estimating equations (GEE) was used to model percent staining
over time in data shown in Figs. 1A and B and 3A. The fitted model
was used to create estimated curves over time and linear combi-
nations of model coefficients were used to compare percent
staining at different time periods, with P values calculated on the
basis of Wald tests. Data displayed in Fig. 1E and 6D–F were
compared using two-sample t tests, after taking a log transform to
correct for skewness. Data in Figs. 2, 4, and 5 were analyzed using
the paired t test. In Fig. 3B, linear regression, estimated using GEE
to account for repeated measures within donor, was used to
evaluate differences. Wald tests were used to make comparisons.
Analysis of in vivo data was performed using longitudinal linear
regression to model tumor size over time. To compare slopes, the
log-likelihoods of nested models (one model assuming different
slopes per group and the other model assuming that the two
groups being compared have the same slope coefficients) were
tested using a likelihood ratio test. The test is based on a c2 with 2
degrees of freedom. Differences in time of survival were analyzed
using a log-rank test and displayed using Kaplan–Meier curves.
Results
AICD is accompanied by nuclear accumulation of p53 and its
rapid phosphorylation on Ser15
Inhibition of p53 can protect T cells from AICD following TCR
restimulation (11). p53 plays a crucial role in coordinating the
cellular stress response and determines fate through either acti-
vating repair or cell death pathways (12). In unstressed cells, p53
levels are repressed through proteasomal degradation via the
E3-ubiquitin ligase HDM2. In response to stress, p53 is phos-
phorylated and the resulting conformational change results in
dissociation from HDM2 (13). To evaluate the role of p53 in

 AICD, the TCR of activated human PBMCs was restimulated with
anti-CD3, which results in a time-dependent increase in surface
expression of the cell death marker Annexin V (Fig. 1A). Levels of
p53, as well as the status of the most commonly phosphorylated
residue (Ser15) was evaluated upon TCR restimulation. Restim-
ulation of the TCR stabilized the expression of total p53 (�2.94-
fold increase) and increased the percentage of phosphorylation
on Ser15 by 3.72-fold within 2 hours (Fig. 1B). A key role of p53 in
cellular stress is its function as a transcription factor with nuclear
accumulation serving as a hallmark of p53 activation (14). We
observed thatthe amount ofp53 localizing to the Hoechst-stained
nucleus within 2 hours of TCR restimulation increased approx-
imately 9-fold (Fig. 1C–E). In addition, nearly all (>97%) of the
Ser15-phosphorylated p53 was detected in the nucleus (Fig. 1F).

 Together, these data demonstrate that induction of AICD follow-
ing TCR restimulation is accompanied by phosphorylation of p53
on Ser15 and accumulation in the nucleus.
Activation of the serine kinase ATM occurs upstream of p53
phosphorylation and is required for AICD
Phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15 is primarily a function of the
PI3K-like serine kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) (15).
ATM is activated via recruitment to the DNA damage sensing MRN
complex followed by autophosphorylation on Ser1981 and
engagement in downstream kinase activity including the phos-
phorylation of p53 on Ser15 (16). Activation of AICD following
TCR restimulation resulted in a 4.6-fold increase in phosphory-
lated ATM that coincided with phosphorylation of p53 (Fig. 2A).
To confirm that ATM was required for p53 phosphorylation, we
preincubated cells with the ATM inhibitors caffeine or KU-55933
(17, 18). Both inhibitors completely prevented the phosphory-
lation of ATM and p53 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that ATM activity is
necessary for the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15 following TCR
restimulation. Furthermore, ATM inhibition nearly completely
(>99%) prevented cell death resulting from TCR restimulation
(Fig. 2B). Together these data suggest that ATM activity is respon-
sible for the phosphorylation of p53 and is a novel upstream
requisite factor in the onset of AICD.
TCR restimulation results in DNA damage
The upregulation of p-ATMSer1981 and p-p53Ser15 is indicative
of a classically defined DNA damage response pathway (19).
However, this pathway can be activated in response to oxidative
stress or hypoxia in the absence of DNA damage (16). As oxidative
stress has already been implicated in the onset of AICD (20), we
determined whether evidence of bona fide DNA damage is
detected following TCR restimulation by examining the status of
gH2AX and p-SMC-1, two well-defined markers of double-strand
DNA breaks (21). Both gH2AX and p-SMC-1 expression increased
greater than 3-fold within 15 minutes of TCR restimulation
(Fig. 3A). These data indicate that evidence of DNA damage
parallels the onset of ATM activation and suggest that TCR
restimulation results in DNA damage and subsequent activation
of the DNA damage response pathway leading to AICD.
To determine the clinical relevance of these findings, we
obtained T cells that had been prepared for adoptive cell transfer
as part of an ongoing clinical trial (NCT01586403). In this
trial, patient autologous PBMCs are transduced with the

 HLA-A2–restricted TIL1383I TCR that recognizes the 368–376
peptide epitope of human tyrosinase, a commonly expressed
melanoma-associated antigen (10, 22). Transduced cells from
melanoma patients and healthy donors were restimulated in an
antigen-specific manner with HLA-A2þ MEL624 melanoma cells
(and HLA-A2� MEL624-28 cells as a negative control). As shown
in Fig. 3B, antigen-specific restimulation of the TCR by MEL624
cells resulted in significant increases in gH2AX (1.7-fold),
p-ATMSer1981 (2.5-fold), and Annexin V staining (2.4-fold) com-
pared with MEL624-28 cells. The increase in these markers did not
differ between cells derived from melanoma patients and healthy
controls. Similar results were obtained in CD4þ T cells (Supple-
mentary Fig. S1). Taken together, these results suggest that the
DNA damage response pathway is also triggered upon both
polyclonal and antigen-specific restimulation of the TCR.
The antioxidant NAC reduces the gH2AX-ATM–mediated DNA
damage response and AICD following TCR restimulation
AICD is dependent on the generation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS; refs. 20, 23). To determine whether ROS are the cause of
DNA damage following TCR restimulation, we preincubated cells
with the antioxidant NAC (50 mmol/L) prior to TCR restimula-
tion. We confirmed that restimulation of the TCR results in
elevation of ROS and that preincubation with NAC significantly

 diminishes this response (Supplementary Fig. S2). Pretreatment
with NAC also prevented the increase in Annexin V staining
(Fig. 4A) and reduced activation of gH2AX and p-ATM by 94%
and 69%, respectively (Fig. 4B and C). These results suggest that
ROS generated upon TCR restimulation play a role in activation of
the DNA damage response pathway.
Ex vivo expansion in NAC increases the persistence and function
of adoptively transferred T cells improving tumor control and
survival in vivo
Kesarwani and colleagues have shown that ex vivo treatment
with NAC improves recovery of T cells harvested from the spleens
of non-tumor–bearing mice 2 days after transfer (24). However,
the effect of culturing cells in NAC on AICD susceptibility and
long-term persistence, particularly within the tumor microenvi-
ronment, remains to be determined. Therefore, we evaluated the
potential benefit of NAC in the Pmel transgenic model (25). To
determine whether the protective effect of NAC in human T cells
extended to mouse T cells, we performed an initial in vitro
characterization of the Pmel cells. Pmel splenocytes expanded in
10 mmol/L NAC exhibited enhanced antioxidant capacity
denoted by an increase in surface thiols (Fig. 5A) and decreased
expression of the oxidative stress marker DCFDA (Fig. 5B). Fur-
thermore, antigen-specific TCR restimulation using gp10025–33
peptide diminished upregulation of gH2AX (Fig. 5C) and signif-
icantly protected cells from AICD (Fig. 5D), suggesting that the
NAC protective effect from activation of the DNA damage
response pathway following TCR restimulation also occurs in the
Pmel model.
Next, Pmel cells cultured in the absence or presence of NAC
were adoptively transferred into C57BL/6J mice challenged with
B16F10 murine melanoma cells. Culturing Pmel cells in NAC
significantly increased the persistence of Vb13þCD8þ cells in the
blood and spleens of recipient mice (Fig. 6A and B). Strikingly, in
mice receiving Pmel cells cultured in NAC, close to 40% of T cells
within the tumor were Vb13þCD8þ, whereas effector T cells from
Pmel cells cultured in the absence of NAC were scarcely detectable
(�1.2%; Fig. 6C).
We also analyzed cells isolated from spleens and tumors for
susceptibility to DNA damage and cell death. Because insufficient
Vb13þCD8þ cells were recovered from tumors of mice that
received control cells, we compared Pmel cells isolated from
tumors of mice receiving NAC-treated cells to the corresponding
splenocytes. Among Pmel T effector cells that trafficked to the
spleen, about 30% had detectable gH2AX (Fig. 6D). Expanding
Pmel cells in the presence of NAC prior to adoptive cell transfer
reduced the gH2AX-positive population by half regardless of
whether cells trafficked to the spleen or the tumor (Fig. 6D).
Restimulation of cells isolated from spleen or tumor with
gp10025–33 peptide shows that a majority of Pmel T effector cells
become Annexin V–positive and that ex vivo culture in NAC
resulted in a significant decrease in Annexin V expression among
cells that had trafficked to the spleen or the tumor (Fig. 6E). In
addition, we found that granzyme B expression inversely corre-
lated with Annexin V staining and that the strongest expression
was observed on Vb13þCD8þ NAC–expanded cells that had
trafficked to the tumor (Fig. 6F).
To determine whether the effects of culturing Pmel cells in the
presence of NAC prior to adoptive transfer extended to antitumor
activity, we adoptively transferred Pmel cells expanded in the
absence or presence of NAC into B16F10-challenged mice. As
expected, Pmel cells are capable of significantly delaying tumor
growth compared with mice receiving no cells (Fig. 7A, P ¼
0.0025), although under the conditions we used, this did not
translate into a significant survival benefit (Fig. 7B). In contrast,
transfer of Pmel cells that had been cultured in NAC resulted in

 highly significant delays in tumor growth compared with mice
receiving no cells (P < 0.0001) and to mice receiving Pmel cells
cultured in the absence of NAC (P < 0.0001). Expansion of cells in
NAC also significantly increased median survival time compared
with mice receiving no cells (P ¼ 0.0004) or those receiving Pmel
cells (Fig. 7B, P ¼ 0.0002). Together, these results suggest that
expanding therapeutic T cells in the presence of NAC prior to
adoptive transfer, can result in a long-lasting benefits following
transfer that enhance persistence, tumor control, and survival.
Discussion
Adoptive transfer of melanoma-specific T cells has generated
curative responses upward of 40% in patients receiving this
experimental therapy, with persistence being the predominant
correlative of therapeutic success (1, 4). The required REP used to
generate sufficient T cells for infusion increases susceptibility to
AICD and may constrain the persistence of the adoptively trans-
ferred cells (6). The possibility that increasing AICD resistance
among therapeutic T cells may improve their antitumor cytotoxic
functionality led us to elucidate the mechanisms and pathways
responsible for AICD to identify possible points of intervention.
The pharmacologic inhibition of p53 can protect activated T
cells from death following TCR restimulation (11), and we have
recently demonstrated that T cells from p53-knockout mice are
likewise protected from AICD (26). However, the activation status
of p53 has not previously been investigated. Our data show that
repetitive stimulation of the TCR results in stabilization and
phosphorylation of p53 on its N-terminal Ser15 residue (Fig. 1).
Phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15 prevents nuclear export, leading
to nuclear accumulation and enhanced p53 nuclear transcrip-
tional activity (27), which is consistent with the increase in total
p53 and nuclear localization of phosphorylated p53 in our study
(Fig. 1). p53 is most notably regarded as the "guardian of the
genome" as it reliably initiates programmed cell death in cells that
have been compromised by DNA damage or other irreparable
cellular stressors. Consequently, nearly 50% of all cancers have
either eliminated or functionally inactivated p53, and T cells from
p53-knockout mice eventually deviate into lymphomas (28, 29).
However, emerging evidence suggests that in the immune system,
p53 plays a more nuanced role in homeostasis than just main-
taining genomic integrity. For example, Watanabe and colleagues
demonstrated that p53 expression is critical to prevent nonspecific
proliferation of T cells in response to IL2 (30). p53 also reduces
autoimmunity by influencing the differentiation of T cells
through repression of STAT3-mediated differentiation of Th17
cells in favor of promoting T regulatory cells (31). Conversely, loss
of p53 expression or function exaggerates autoimmunity and co-
associates with many autoimmune conditions, where defective
AICD is also problematic, including arthritis (32–36), multiple
sclerosis, (37, 38), and Crohn disease (39, 40). Our data suggest
that activation of p53 plays a critical role in T-cell death and offers
a potential explanation for the coassociation between p53 and
autoimmune disorders. However, given that p53 plays pleiotropic
roles in immune regulation and lack of expression is associated
with cancer development, it is unlikely that targeting p53 is a
suitable strategy to improve function of adoptively transferred
cells.
Although p53 can be activated by a variety of cellular stressors,
it is chiefly a responder to DNA damage. Indeed, our data support
a rapid incursion of DNA damage evidenced by the phosphory-
lation and activation of two DSB repair proteins, H2AX and SMC-
1, within 15 minutes of TCR restimulation (Fig. 3). The serine
kinase ATM acts as the primary liaison between a DNA damage
insult and the activation of p53. ATM derives its name from being
the "mutated" kinase responsible for the onset of the neurode-
generative disorder ataxia telangiectasia (A-T). As ATM is func-
tionally inactivated in A-T patients, T cells from these patients are
resistant to phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15 and fail to undergo
cell death in response to DNA-damaging insults (41, 42). Similar
to functional inactivation of ATM in A-T patients, we found that
inhibition of ATM by both caffeine and the pharmacologic

 inhibitor KU-55933 prevented phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15
and protected T cells from death upon TCR restimulation (Fig. 2).
These results suggest that ATM-mediated phosphorylation of p53
on Ser15 may play a novel role as a requisite factor in the onset
AICD.
ROS are generated within 15 minutes of TCR crosslinking
(23) and have recently been shown to play key signaling roles
within mitochondria for antigen-specific expansion of T cells
(43). However, oxidative stress is also the primary endogenous
assailant of DNA damage (44). The accumulation of DNA
damage coupled with a diminished capacity for DNA dou-
ble-strand break repair is a problem associated with aging
immune cells that correlates with a decline in immune function
and increased senescence (45, 46). As T cells proliferate in vitro,
they accumulate DNA damage and downregulate the DNA
repair machinery (47, 48). T cells with short telomeres, indic-
ative of a longer replicative history, have higher baseline levels
of gH2AX, a delayed DNA repair response, and are also more
susceptible to cell death (49, 50). Erosion of telomeres corre-
lates with poor persistence and patient responses in clinical
trials (51). Taken together, these studies suggest the possibility
that increased DNA damage and decreased ability for DNA
repair can preferentially lead to elimination of the adoptively
transferred cells through AICD. Indeed, studies affirm that
younger, less differentiated T cells are superior at in vivo tumor
control (7, 8).
The amount of DNA damage in lymphocytes negatively corre-
lates with the level of intracellular glutathione (52), prompting us
to hypothesize that treatment with the glutathione pro-drug NAC
may be beneficial. Studies have shown that NAC can increase the
proliferative potential and cytokine production of T cells and even
restores the functional capacity of PBMCs from advanced stage
cancer patients (24, 53–55). Indeed, pretreatment of human T
cells with NAC decreased gH2AX expression, activation of ATM,
and cell death in response to TCR restimulation (Fig. 4). More-
over, adding NAC to the culture medium of Pmel cells bolstered
their surface thiol levels, reduced oxidative stress, and as in human
T cells, diminished gH2AX levels and susceptibility to cell death
(Figs. 5 and 6). Whether NAC prevents the formation of DNA
damage or rather enhances p53-mediated DNA repair remains to
be determined.
Importantly, ex vivo culture in NAC resulted in long-term
benefits as adoptively transferred cells appeared to retain resis-
tance to DNA damage and AICD even 6 days after adoptive
transfer with no additional NAC supplementation (Fig. 6C and
D). The benefits of ex vivo expansion in NAC translated into
increased persistence in the blood, spleen, and tumors of
B16F10 challenged mice (Fig. 6A–C). Consistent with the persis-
tence of transferred cells being a key corollary of therapeutic
success in the clinic (4), these more durable NAC-cultured cells
enhanced tumor control and survival of recipient mice (Fig. 7),
which supports our premise that protecting T cells from AICD may
enhance theirtherapeutic efficacy.Ex vivo expanded T cells usedfor
adoptive immunotherapy generally acquire an effector memory
phenotype (TEM cells) with limited persistence and reduced
antitumor efficacy compared with central memory phenotype
cells (TCM). Kesarwani and colleagues showed that TCM cells have
an increased expression of redox regulators (24) and we deter-
mined that TCM cells (CD8þCCR7hi) were more resistant to
upregulation of gH2AX following TCR restimulation. However,
expansion of T cells in the presence of NAC did not increase the
proportion of TCM cells, suggesting that increased persistence
is likely not due to alterations in memory cell populations
(Scheffel and colleagues, manuscript in preparation). A striking
observation was that Pmel cells expanded in NAC were found at
33-fold higher levelswithin the tumor microenvironment (Fig.6).
Whether this accumulation within the tumor is simply due to
AICD resistance or whether NAC also has beneficial effects on T-
cell trafficking will need to be investigated. The impact of NAC on
T-cell phenotype is currently under further investigation.
ROS are required for signaling in T-cell activation but also
contribute to cell death susceptibility, indicating a delicate bal-
ance is crucial to ensure optimal T-cell function. Previously, we
have shown that both the c-jun NH2 kinase (JNK) inhibitor
SP600125 and the ROS scavenger MnTBAP protected cells from
AICD and that inhibition of JNK, but not ROS generation,
interfered with T-cell function (20). Consistent with these find-
ings, altering the antioxidative potential of the cells through ex vivo
culture in NAC did not appear to impair the cytotoxic function of
T cells as NAC-cultured cells expressed significantly higher levels
of granzyme B (Fig. 6F), which may have contributed to improved
tumor control and survival (Fig. 7).
In summary, this study shows that repetitive stimulation of
the TCR results in activation of the DNA damage response
pathway as evidenced by an increase in two DNA damage
response markers (H2AX, SMC-1) and subsequent activation
of ATM and p53. Our study suggests an additional layer of
regulation whereby an individual T cell would be more or less
susceptible to AICD through its ability to repair or succumb to
DNA damage induced by TCR restimulation. Importantly,
evidence of DNA damage pathway activation was observed in
response to antigen-specific restimulation of TIL1383I trans-
duced T cells that are currently being used in a clinical trial (Fig.
3B). This suggests the possibility that adoptively transferred
cells may undergo AICD upon encountering tumor antigen that
may contribute to poor persistence. As culturing cells in NAC
both quelled susceptibility to DNA damage as suggested by
significantly reduced expression of gH2AX after adoptive trans-
fer (Fig. 6D) and enhanced tumor control in the Pmel mouse
model (Fig. 7), we postulate that expanding therapeutic cells in
NAC, which has a long and safe history in clinical use, could be
an expeditious improvement to current protocols.
