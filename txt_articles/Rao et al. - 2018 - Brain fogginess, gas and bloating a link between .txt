between SIBO, probiotics and metabolic
acidosis

Abstract
Background: D-lactic acidosis is characterized by brain fogginess (BF) and elevated D-lactate and occurs in short
bowel syndrome. Whether it occurs in patients with an intact gut and unexplained gas and bloating is unknown. We
aimed to determine if BF, gas and bloating is associated with D-lactic acidosis and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
(SIBO).
Methods: Patients with gas, bloating, BF, intact gut, and negative endoscopic and radiological tests, and those
without BF were evaluated. SIBO was assessed with glucose breath test (GBT) and duodenal aspiration/culture.
Metabolic assessments included urinary D-lactic acid and rblood L-lactic acid, and ammonia levels. Bowel symptoms,
and gastrointestinal transit were assessed.
Results: Thirty patients with BF and 8 without BF were evaluated. Abdominal bloating, pain, distension and gas were
the most severe symptoms and their prevalence was similar between groups. In BF group, all consumed probiotics.
SIBO was more prevalent in BF than non-BF group (68 vs. 28%, p = 0.05). D-lactic acidosis was more prevalent in BF
compared to non-BF group (77 vs. 25%, p = 0.006). BF was reproduced in 20/30 (66%) patients. Gastrointestinal transit
was slow in 10/30 (33%) patients with BF and 2/8 (25%) without. Other metabolic tests were unremarkable. After
discontinuation of probiotics and a course of antibiotics, BF resolved and gastrointestinal symptoms improved
significantly (p = 0.005) in 23/30 (77%).
Conclusions: We describe a syndrome of BF, gas and bloating, possibly related to probiotic use, SIBO, and D-lactic
acidosis in a cohort without short bowel. Patients with BF exhibited higher prevalence of SIBO and D-lactic acidosis.
Symptoms improved with antibiotics and stopping probiotics. Clinicians should recognize and treat this condition.
Introduction
Abdominal bloating, gas and distension are common
gastrointestinal symptoms that are caused by many con-
ditions including carbohydrate intolerance and small
intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)1. Brain Fogginess
(BF) describes a constellation of symptoms comprised of
mental confusion, impaired judgment, poor short-term
memory, and difficulty with concentration, which is often
transient and disabling. Previously, similar symptoms,
along with slurred speech and gait disturbances have been
described in patients with short bowel syndrome2,3. These
patients were found to have metabolic acidosis with ele-
vated levels of D-lactic acid in the serum. Others have
described brain fogginess in association with other
chronic disorders including postural orthostatic tachy-
cardia syndrome4,5. Recently, probiotic use has been
implicated in the production of D-lactic acidosis, both in
short bowel syndrome patients and in the first 2 weeks of
life

 formula6,7. Typically, D-lactic acidosis is caused by the
fermentation of ingested carbohydrate by D-lactic pro-
ducing bacteria such as lactobacillus and bifidobacterium
in the bowel2,3.
In a preliminary report, we described seven patients
who presented with both unexplained abdominal bloating
and BF and who were consuming probiotics8. Whether
there is a link between abdominal bloating, distention,
gas, D-lactic acidosis, and small intestinal bacterial over-
growth (SIBO), and probiotic usage is not known. We
examined whether small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
(SIBO), particularly with D-lactic acid producing bacteria
may cause a syndrome of BF, gas, bloating, and neuro-
cognitive symptoms.
Our aim was to evaluate a consecutive series of patients
with unexplained BF, abdominal bloating and gas, for
SIBO, using both duodenal aspirate and cultures, and a
glucose breath test (GBT), and simultaneously assess for
metabolic acidosis.
Methods
We conducted a prospective observational study of
consecutive adult patients referred to our tertiary care
center over 3 years. Patients presenting with unexplained
abdominal gas, bloating and distension, and BF were
included. BF was defined as presence of two or more of
the following symptoms for more than 3 months during
their initial clinic visit: mental confusion, cloudiness,
impaired judgment, poor short-term memory, and diffi-
culty with concentration. Given the multiple constellation
of abdominal symptoms, our patients could not be defi-
nitively categorized into any one of the Rome III classi-
fication of functional gastrointestinal disorders, and hence
they were categorized as unexplained symptoms. Addi-
tionally only subjects with normal upper endoscopy and
duodenal biopsy, normal colonoscopy and biopsy, and
normal abdominal CT imaging, and normal hematological
and biochemical profiles were enrolled. Patients with a
history of small bowel or colonic surgery, those with
known intestinal dysmotility (scleroderma or pseudo-
obstruction), and those with a history of recent antibiotic
use (in the previous 6 weeks), or history of known neu-
rological or neuropsychiatric problems or celiac disease or
Helicobacter Pylori infection or renal or liver failure were
excluded from the study. We also evaluated a cohort of
patients with similar symptom profiles and who met the
inclusion and exclusion criteria, but without brain foggi-
ness (Non-BF). The institutional review board approved
this study, number 611925–2.
All patients filled out a validated questionnaire9 that
assessed 9 symptoms; abdominal pain, belching, bloating,
fullness, indigestion, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and gas.
The frequency, intensity and duration of each symptom
was rated on a 0–3 point Likert scale8–10. A mean total
score was calculated, and symptoms were assessed at
baseline and after treatment. A score ≥5 was considered
severe. All patients were followed up for 6 months.
Additionally, we inquired about probiotic use, a history of
food fads, yogurt consumption, and use of over the
counter medications and recent antibiotic use. Patients
were asked to discontinue the use of laxatives and drugs
that affect intestinal motility (opioids, anticholinergics,
and anti-diarrheals) at least one week prior to the study,
but were allowed to continue with other maintenance
medications.
Patients had duodenal aspirate and cultures and glucose
breath test within one week10–12. No new medications
were allowed during testing. Blood samples were collected
for bun, electrolytes, creatinine and liver biochemistry.
Metabolic testing included assessment of blood glucose,
insulin, ammonia and L-lactate levels and urinary D-lactic
acid levels after a carbohydrate challenge. Assessment of
gastrointestinal transit consisted of the wireless motility
capsule test (SmartPill ®, Medtronic Corporation, Min-
neapolis, MN) where a subject ingested a capsule con-
taining pressure, pH, and temperature sensors, and wore a
recorder for 5 days to assess regional and whole gut
transit13,14. Alternatively, they had a gastric emptying test
with radioactive technetium meal and a colonic transit test
where the subject ingested a capsule with 24 radio-opaque
markers and had a plain abdomen X-ray at 120 h13,14.
Duodenal aspiration and culture
After an overnight fast, an upper endoscope was passed
into the distal duodenum with minimal air insufflation.
Using aseptic technique, a 2 mm nasobiliary catheter
(Liguory ®, COOK Medical, Bloomington, IN, US) was
advanced through the endoscope into the distal duode-
num, and 3–5 ml of fluid was aspirated and sent to the
microbiology laboratory for standard aerobic, anaerobic
and fungal cultures. The duodenal culture results were
considered as positive for SIBO if one or more organisms
(aerobic or anaerobic) were cultured with a colony count
of ≥103 CFU/ml10,11.
Glucose breath test (GBT)
After an overnight fast, 75 g of glucose dissolved in 250
ml water was administered orally. Breath samples were
obtained at baseline and at 15 min intervals for 2 h, and
analyzed for both hydrogen and methane using gas
chromatography (QuinTron Micro Analyzer ®, QuinTron
Instrument
Company
Inc.
Milwaukee,
WI)10–12.
Throughout the study, the patients scored the presence
and severity of symptoms on a likert scale7. GBT was
considered positive for SIBO if there was ≥20 p.p.m.
increase above baseline for H2 or for combined H2 and
CH4
11,15–18. In 3 subjects with diabetes, fructose breath
test was performed using previously described methods19.

 Metabolic testing (lactic acid)
In order to assess lactic acidosis we used a novel method
of assessing blood and urine lactic acid levels after an oral
carbohydrate challenge (Glucose) i.e., simultaneously
alongside the glucose breath test. Blood samples were
collected at baseline, 1/2, 1, 2, and 3 h after administration
of glucose, and sent for serum L-lactic acid, and ammonia
levels. L-Lactic acid levels ≥2.2 mmo/L were considered
positive and indicative of acidosis. Urine samples for D-
lactic acid were collected at baseline, 1 h, and 3 h during
and after the GBT and analyzed in specialist lab (Mayo
Clinic Laboratories, Rochester, MN). D-Lactic acid levels
≥0.22 mmol/L were considered abnormal and indicative
of acidosis. Urinary as opposed to blood D-lactic acid
assessment was chosen due to its stability at room tem-
perature and for remote processing as recommended by
the specialist lab.
Statistical analysis
Symptoms and global satisfaction data were compared
before and after treatment using Chesapeake Test. CHI
square test was used to compare data between the BF and
non-BF groups with regards to the prevalence of D-lactic
acidosis, and SIBO and symptoms.
Results
Demographics
We evaluated a total of 42 patients, of whom 34 had BF
and 8 had no BF (non-BF) (Fig. 1). Four patients in the BF
group were excluded because of recent antibiotic use (1),
inability to complete all tests or technical problems with
collection/transport of samples (2), and new diagnosis of
Parkinson’s disease (1). Thirty patients, f/m = 19/11, mean
age 52 years were included (Table 1A). Six patients were
on gluten-restricted, 3 on FODMAP-restricted, and 1 on
Paleo diets. All 8 patients (f/m = 5/3, mean age 49 years)
in the non-BF group met inclusion criteria (Table 1B).
Two patients were on FODMAP restricted diet.
Gastrointestinal symptoms
The most common symptoms in the BF group were
abdominal pain (96.7%), bloating (93.3%), distention
(90%), fullness (90%), gas (90%), cramping (80%), diarrhea
(76.7%), and belching (90). Severe bloating with significant
and rapid increase in abdominal size from normal to full
distension within few minutes was described by 6/30
(20%) patients in BF group only. In the non-BF group, the
most common symptoms were abdominal pain (75%),
bloating (100%), distention (88%), fullness (88%), gas
(100%), belching (88%), diarrhea (50%), and cramping
(75%). Severe symptoms (≥5), were pain, bloating, dis-
tention, and gas in both groups.
Brain fogginess
Neurocognitive symptoms including BF or mental
confusion or impaired judgment, poor short-term mem-
ory, and difficulty with concentration were described by
all of the patients in the BF group. These symptoms lasted
between 30 min to several hours, often post-prandial, and
intermittently during the course of the day. Also 28/30
(94%) patients reported post-prandial fatigue and weak-
ness, and 2/30 reported persistent daily fatigue unrelated
to meal intake. BF was so severe that 4/30 (13.3%) had
quit their jobs. One patient had recurrent near syncopal

 episodes after carbohydrate-rich meals. One patient had
symptoms of bloating and BF with a blistering rash on the
palms. Another patient’s symptoms caused her to be bed-
ridden for up to a week after consuming a large
carbohydrate-rich meal.
Probiotics and other medication use
All patients in the BF group were taking probiotics (range
3 months to 3 years), some were taking 2–3 different
varieties containing lactobacillus species, and/or bifido-
bacterium species or streptococcus thermophillus and oth-
ers. Additionally 11 (36.7%) were using cultured yogurt
daily, and 2 (6.7%) large amounts (20 oz.) of homemade
cultured yogurt daily. Opioid use was found in 7/30 (23.3%),
and PPI use and multivitamins in 13/30 (43.3%). Fish Oil
and Biotin supplementation in 4/30 patients and 1/30
(3.3%) were taking ubiquinone, dessicated thyroid, sime-
thicone, melatonin, curcumin, saw palmetto, samento
extract, and artemisinin extract. One patient (12%) in the
non-BF group took probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus), 3/
8 (37%) were using PPI, 3/8 (37%) multivitamin and fish oil
supplements, and one opioids.
Breath test
In the BF group, breath testing was positive for SIBO in
11/30 (36.6%) patients (Table 1, Fig. 1). The patient’s
typical BF symptom(s) experienced at home was repro-
duced during the breath test in 20/30 (66%) and all of
them had evidence of SIBO either with the breath test or
with culture. In the non-BF group, breath test was positive
in 1 (14%) and negative in 7 (16%); D-lactic acidosis was
seen in 2/7 (28%) patients with negative breath test.
Duodenal aspirate and culture
In the BF group, cultures for SIBO were positive in 14
(46.7%) patients and negative in 14 patients (46.7%)
(Fig. 2); 2 patients did not have duodenal aspiration.
Aerobic strains were grown in 22 (64.7%), and anaerobic
bacteria in 9 (26.5%) patients. The predominant aerobic
organisms were Streptococcus species, Staphylococcus
species, Neisseria species, and Hemophilus species, and the
predominant anaerobic organisms were gram negative
rods, and cocci, gram positive rods – lactobacillus species,
and prevotella species. The disposition of D and/or L-
lactic acidosis is summarized in Fig. 2. In the non-BF

 group, 2/8 (25%) had positive culture for SIBO and one
subject grew streptococcus species, and neisseria, and
second subject grew rothia species and pseudomonas, and
1/8 (14%) grew candida species.
Metabolic testing (lactic acid)
In the BF group, D-lactic acidosis was seen in 23 (76.7%)
patients along with concurrent L-lactic acidosis in 9 (30%)
patients (Table 1A). The mean BUN level was 13.5 mg/dl
(normal <23), mean creatinine level was 0.74 mg/dl
(normal <1.6), and mean ALT level was 27.8 U/l (normal
<49). The mean baseline ammonia level was 23.4 umol/l
(normal <35) with normal liver chemistries, but 9/30
(30%) had mild elevations (39–51 umol/l) of ammonia
during the breath test. In the non-BF group, 2 (28%)
patients had D-lactic acidosis and one of them also had l-
lactic acidosis (Table 1B). The BUN and liver chemistry
was normal and mean baseline ammonia level was 18.1
umol/l, and 2/8 (38–54 umol/l) had mild elevations
during the breath test. The prevalence of D-lactic
acidosis was significantly higher in the BF group when
compared to the non-BF group (76.7 vs. 25%, p < 0.006).
Also 10/13 (78%) PPI users and 4/7 opioid users had
D-lactic acidosis.
Gastrointestinal transit assessment
In the BF group, 17 patients had wireless motility cap-
sule test (WMC), 13 had gastric emptying scintigraphy,
and 7 had colonic transit study with radioopaque mar-
kers12,13. Overall 10/30 patients (33%) had abnormal
gastrointestinal transit and evidence of dysmotiltiy. Gas-
troparesis was diagnosed in 5/30 (16.7%) patients, 1 of
whom had concurrent prolonged small bowel transit time,
and another concurrent slow colonic transit. Rapid gastric
emptying was seen in 1 patient with normal small bowel
or colonic transit, and the rest had normal gastric emp-
tying. Slow transit constipation was found in 6/24 (25%)
patients who had colonic transit studies, 1 of whom had
gastroparesis, and another had slow small bowel transit.
All 10 patients with dysmotility had evidence of SIBO and
evidence for lactic acidosis. In the non-BF group (based
on WMC), 2 patients (25%) had gastroparesis, and 3
patients (37%) had slow colonic transit; one of whom had
concurrent upper dysmotility. There was no difference
(p ≥ 0.2) in prevalence of abnormal transit between
groups.
Testing summary
In the BF group, metabolic testing for D-lactic acid/L-
lactic acid production was positive in 24/30 (80%)
patients, duodenal aspirate/culture was positive in 14
(46.7%), and glucose BT in 11 (36.6%). Based on either a
positive
GBT
and/or
duodenal
aspirate/culture,
19
(63.3%) patients were diagnosed with SIBO and all of
them had d-lactic acidosis. The prevalence of SIBO was
significantly higher in the BF group when compared to the
non-BF group (63.3 vs. 25%, p = 0.05).
Follow up
In the BF group, all patients with evidence of lactic
acidosis and/or SIBO were treated with various antibiotics
(amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cotrimoxazole,
rifaximin, metronidazole, tinidazole, and ciprofloxacin)
based on the individual allergy profile and culture/sensi-
tivity results, and were asked to discontinue probiotics
(N = 23). The remaining patients without evidence of
SIBO were asked to discontinue probiotics and yogurt use
(N = 7). 24/30 (80%) attended follow-up clinic visits at
6 weeks and 3 months and rest were assessed by phone
inquiry. GI symptoms were inquired through a validated
questionnaire9, including global improvement using a
0–10 visual analog scale. We also inquired about the
presence or absence of BF. After treatment, 70% of
patients
reported
significant
improvement
in
their
symptoms with a significant change in the mean global
VAS score (P = 0.005), (Fig. 3). 85% of patients reported
complete resolution of BF. There were also significant
(p < 0.05) improvements in the individual mean symptom
scores (before vs. after) for abdominal pain (6.17 vs. 4.17),
cramping (3.17 vs. 2.17), bloating (6.5 vs. 4.08), fullness
(5.58 vs. 3.5), and distention (5.75 vs. 3.75); but not for
other symptoms. Likewise, in the non-BF group, all 4

 Discussion
We describe a cohort of patients with an intact gut who
reported brain fogginess associated with unexplained
abdominal bloating, pain, gas and distension, and in
whom there was evidence of probiotic use, D-lactic
acidosis and SIBO. The prevalence of both D-lactic
acidosis and SIBO was significantly higher in patients
with BF compared to those without BF.
The unique feature of this cohort was the presence of BF,
which was described as variable in severity and intensity,
often post-prandial, and forced some patients to quit their
jobs. Also they reported significant bloating, abdominal
pain, distention, and fullness. Additional symptoms inclu-
ded extreme fatigue, restlessness, weakness, and dis-
orientation. These symptoms occurred at variable times
and could last 30 min to a few hours. Few described
excessive belching, diarrhea, abdominal cramping and
headache. During the breath test, brain fogginess was
reproduced in 66% of patients. This suggests that the
carbohydrate meal provoked brain fogginess and repro-
duced their typical symptom experienced at home. Fur-
thermore, 63% of patients had SIBO (as evidenced by
duodenal aspirate/culture or breath test), and 80% had D-
lactic acid/L-lactic acidosis. In contrast, SIBO and D-lactic
acidosis was seen in a significantly lower proportion (28%)
of patients with similar gastrointestinal symptoms, but
without BF. These data provide compelling evidence for
possible link between brain fogginess, SIBO and d-lactic
acidosis. Unlike previous reports, our cohort developed d-
lactic acidosis and BF without impaired renal or hepatic
function and/or short bowel syndrome3.
D-lactic acidosis was first described by Oh et al in 1979
in a patient with short bowel syndrome who presented
with unexplained anion gap metabolic acidosis and epi-
sodes of severe neuropsychological symptoms2. The L-
isomer of lactic acid is the main form of lactic acid in the
human body and is produced by the enzymatic (L-lactate
dehydrogenase) reduction of pyruvate. D-lactate is pro-
duced in much smaller quantities by the enzyme D-2-
hydroxyl acid dehydrogenase that also metabolizes D-
lactate in the human liver3. Unlike L-lactate that is effi-
ciently metabolized, the breakdown of D-lactate via the
methylglyoxal pathway is slow and limited and can be
confounded by comorbid conditions causing significant
accumulation and acidosis3,20. In short bowel syndrome, if
the colon is colonized by D-lactate producing bacteria, the
delivery of large amounts of unabsorbed carbohydrate
causes rapid fermentation, gaseous distension, and pro-
duction of large amounts of d-lactic acid overwhelming
hepatic clearance20, and causing D-lactic acidosis and
encephalopathy.
Here, the BF was likely induced by the production of
toxic metabolites such as D-lactic acid in the small
intestine from bacterial fermentation of carbohydrate
substrates. The use of prolonged or excessive probiotics
and/or cultured yogurt further contributed to the small
intestinal colonization by lactobacilli and other bacteria.
These bacteria are generally resistant to usual antibiotics3,
further explaining the refractory nature of symptoms.
Probiotics are considered to be safe and beneficial
including improvement in gut barrier function and gut
transit21. Although a meta-analysis of 57 studies indicated
that probiotics are safe22, caution against its use has been
recommended in subjects who are immunosuppressed,
pregnant, and with structural heart lesions, acute abdo-
men, neutropenia, chemotherapy and radiotherapy22,23.
However, studies have not been well designed, and safety
outcomes have been inconsistently reported. The Agency
for Healthcare Research and Quality concluded that there
is inadequate literature on the safety of probiotics, espe-
cially given their widespread and OTC use24. There are
reports of fungemia, bacteremia and gut ischemia in at
risk, critically ill populations, many using Saccharomyces
species or Lactobacillus23–27.
Lactobacillus species and bifidobacterium are the most
common bacteria in probiotic formulations21,28, and are
felt to be useful in the treatment of irritable bowel syn-
drome, inflammatory bowel disease, and other intestinal
problems29. Both bacteria produce D-lactic acid. D-lactic
acidosis has been described with Salmonella enteritidis
and with probiotics30. Probiotics are designed to deliver
bacteria to the colon but whether this is achieved has not
been reliably shown21–23,27,28,31. In contrast, they may
colonize the small bowel, especially in the presence of
dysmotility or low acid conditions that favor bacterial
overgrowth. We found a variety of aerobic and anaerobic
species of bacteria in the proximal small bowel and three
patients had Lactobacilli and/or Prevotella species. Also
these bacteria are resistant to routine antibiotics. Inter-
estingly, some Lactobacillus species such as Lactoba-
cillus GG only produce L-lactate30,32. Hence, both D-
lactate and L-lactate should be measured when assessing
this condition, and the most practical way for its diag-
nosis is to administer a carbohydrate meal and assess D-
lactate in urine and L-lactate in blood, over the next 3 h
along with breath samples for hydrogen and methane.
We treated all patients with evidence of SIBO with
antibiotics and discontinuation of probiotics, and the rest
with dietary advice and stopping probiotics. These mea-
sures led to significant improvement of symptoms in 70%
of our patients and complete resolution of brain fogginess
in 85% of patients, reaffirming that the symptoms were
related to D-lactic acidosis and SIBO. Likewise, the group
of patients without BF, but with either SIBO or D-lactic
acidosis also showed similar degree of improvement in
symptoms after antibiotics.

intestinal dysmotility10 Similarly dumping or rapid upper

 gut transit may cause colonic fermentation similar to
short bowel. We measured regional and whole gut transit
time using validated techniques14. In the BF group, except
one patient, none showed evidence for dumping. About 1/
3rd of our subjects had gastrointestinal dysmotility
including gastroparesis, delayed small bowel and colonic
transit that may have contributed to SIBO10,11,13,14, but
rest had normal transit. Likewise in the non-BF group,
25% had gastroparesis and 37% had slow transit con-
stipation that may have contributed to SIBO, but there
was no difference between the two groups suggesting that
dysmotility by itself may not contribute to brain fogginess.
Additionally, opioids and PPI use may have predisposed
patients to SIBO as 78% of PPI users had D-lactic
acidosis10.
Our study has several limitations including the obser-
vational nature, although we examined a consecutive
series of patients. Also, we did not culture fluid from the
distal small bowel where most of the colonization may
have occurred from probiotics because of the practical
limitation of reaching this portion of the gut using stan-
dard endoscopy. This may have limited our ability to
accurately link the probiotic use with SIBO. We did not
retest these subjects to check if SIBO had resolved. There
is no medical definition or criteria for BF, and therefore
we relied on patient’s description of symptoms, and used
the presence of ≥2/5 symptoms suggestive of BF. Also,
whether the BF group had SIBO prior to using probiotics
is unclear.
In conclusion, we describe a syndrome of a constellation
of symptoms that comprises of post-prandial abdominal
bloating, distension, gas and BF that were associated with
the use of probiotics, and possibly caused by SIBO and D-
lactic acidosis. The prevalence of SIBO and D-lactic
acidosis was significantly higher in patients with BF than
those without BF. We advise caution against excessive and
indiscriminate use of probiotics especially without a well-
defined medical indication, and particularly in patients
with gastrointestinal dysmotility, and/or those using long
term PPI and opioids.
Study Highlights
What is current knowledge
● D-lactic acidosis is rarely encountered in routine GI
practice, but occasionally seen in patients with
short bowel syndrome.
● Recently, we have encountered several patients
with unexplained brain fogginess, associated with
significant gas, bloating and abdominal pain.
Whether these symptoms are due to D-lactic
acidosis and are associated with small intestinal
bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is not known.
What is new here
● We found that over 2/3rd of patients with brain
fogginess demonstrated D-lactic acidosis,along with
significantly higher prevalence of SIBO when
compared to those without brain fogginess.
● Discontinuation of probiotics along with the use of
antibiotics led to resolution of symptoms.
Clinicians should recognize, diagnose and treat
this unique syndrome.
