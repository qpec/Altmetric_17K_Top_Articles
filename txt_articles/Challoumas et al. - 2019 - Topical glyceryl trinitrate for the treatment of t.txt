Objective To produce a best evidence synthesis of the 
clinical effects of topical glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) in the 
treatment of tendinopathies.
Design A systematic review of published randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs) of the use of GTN in patients with 
tendinopathy.
Data sources MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus and CINAHL 
from database inception to January 2018.
Methods We examined RCTs comparing the effects of 
topical GTN with either placebo or other treatments on 
tendinopathy. Overall quality of each eligible study was 
determined based on a combined assessment of internal 
validity, external validity and precision. The level of 
evidence for each assessed parameter was rated based 
on the system by van Tulder et al.
Results A total of 10 eligible RCTs were identified 
including patients with tendinopathy of the rotator cuff 
(n=4), wrist extensors (n=3), Achilles (n=2) and patellar 
(n=1) tendons. For all tendinopathies, improvements 
in pain were significant when comparing GTN versus 
placebo in the short term (<8 weeks; poor evidence). 
Significant improvements in midterm outcomes for 
treatment with GTN versus placebo included the 
following: patient satisfaction (strong evidence); 
chances of being asymptomatic with activities of daily 
living (strong evidence); range of movement (moderate 
evidence); strength (moderate evidence); pain (at night 
and with activity; poor evidence) and local tenderness 
(poor evidence). Patients treated with topical GTN 
reported a higher incidence of headaches than those 
who received placebo (moderate evidence).
Conclusions and relevance Treatment of 
tendinopathies with topical GTN for up to 6 months 
appears to be superior to placebo and may therefore be 
a useful adjunct to the treating healthcare professions.
InTRODuCTIOn
Overuse tendon injuries namely tendinopathies pose 
a significant clinical problem, particularly in muscu-
loskeletal and sports-related medicine,1 accounting 
for up to 30% of general practice musculoskeletal 
consultations. The pathogenesis of tendinopathy 
is multifactorial and complex, and even though 
several theories have been suggested, the exact 
causative factors remain unknown.2–7 Our incom-
plete understanding of the mechanisms underpin-
ning tendon pathophysiology continues to hamper 
the development of targeted therapies, which have 
been successful in other areas of musculoskel-
etal medicine.8 The most common exacerbating 
factor is thought to be overuse (particularly during 
sporting activities) causing repetitive microtrauma 
and consequent degeneration due to failure of the 
healing process.2 6 Manifestations range from mild 
pain and swelling to complete loss of function, and 
diagnosis is usually based on a thorough history and 
physical examination4; however imaging modalities 
such as ultrasound and MRI can be useful, espe-
cially for identifying tears.9 Tendinopathy appears 
to result from an imbalance between the protective/
regenerative changes and the pathological responses 
that result from tendon overuse.5 6 The net result is 
tendon degeneration, weakness, tearing and pain.10
As the basic science of tendinopathy has evolved, 
so have the treatment options for these conditions. 
First-line treatment comprising several modalities 
ranging from relative rest and progressive loading 
to invasive pharmacological interventions continues 
to be the mainstay of treatment.4 Apart from 
loading which is widely recognised to be effective 
for the treatment of tendinopathies,11 the benefits 
of the remaining available therapies are equivocal, 
and treatment options are usually tried sequentially 
starting from the least noxious.12 The use of topical 
glyceryl nitrate (GTN), also known as nitroglycerin, 
for the management of tendinopathies was first 
reported by Berrazueta et al,13 who demonstrated 
successful treatment of acute rotator cuff tendinop-
athy with topical GTN. Due to the conflicting avail-
able evidence and its potential side effects, topical 
nitroglycerin is not currently licenced for the treat-
ment of tendinopathies in the UK; however, it is 
sometimes used either on its own or alongside 
other treatment modalities based on evidence from 
several randomised controlled trials (RCTs).14
Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical produced 
by a family of enzymes, the nitric oxide synthases 
(NOSs). Its involvement in tendon injury has been 
clearly demonstrated in the laboratory in several 
rodent studies, where all three NOS isoforms 
(b-NOS, e-NOS and i-NOS) were found to be 
upregulated both in acute and chronic tendon inju-
ries,15 16 and tendon healing appeared to be reduced 
in rodents fed a competitive NOS inhibitor.17 
Definitive conclusions on the exact role of NO in 
tendon healing are yet to be reached; however, 
experiments have shown that it likely enhances 
new tissue synthesis through its involvement in a 
number of processes, including local blood flow, 
host defence and collagen synthesis,18 all of which 
could potentially enhance the healing process of the 
injured tendon.
The limited existing evidence on the effective-
ness of topical GTN on tendinopathy has reported 
conflicting results.12 In their Cochrane review

Review

cuff tendinopathy specifically, Cumpston et al14 concluded that 
there may be benefits on acute disease; however, evidence on 
chronic tendinopathy is insufficient. In the other relevant 
systematic review and meta-analysis, Gambito et al19 analysed 
the effects of topical GTN on all tendinopathies and reported 
that there is strong evidence that GTN is effective in both 
relieving pain and increasing tendon strength. To our knowl-
edge, no further relevant systematic reviews have been published 
since the study by Gambito et al19 to examine the influence of 
subsequent RCTs on the outcomes in tendon disease.
The aim of this systematic review is to present the best avail-
able evidence on the effectiveness of topical GTN on tendinop-
athy and its side effects with a view to guiding future guidelines. 
After presentation of the findings of studies comparing topical 
GTN with placebo or alternative treatments, assessment of their 
quality and determination of the strength of available evidence, 
our specific objectives were to conclude on the effects of topical 
GTN in generic outcomes for each type of tendinopathy and all 
tendinopathies both in the short-term and midterm phases.
MATeRIAls AnD MeThODs
The present systematic review has been conducted and authored 
according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)20 guidelines.
eligibility
Included studies were RCTs comparing at least one treatment 
group receiving topical GTN with a control group receiving 
either placebo or an alternative treatment. Studies with 
participants undergoing concurrent additional therapies were 
included only if both arms of the study received this additional 
treatment at the same frequency and intensity. Participants had 
to be over 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of tendinopathy 
with or without radiological signs. Duration of symptoms/
signs was not a criterion, neither was length of treatment with, 
dosage and type of topical GTN used. Language criteria were 
not applied.

Review
search strategy
A thorough literature search was conducted by two of the authors 
(DC and DB) independently via MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus 
in January 2018, with the following Boolean operators: ‘(GTN 
OR glyceryl trinitrate OR nitroglycerin) AND (tendinopathy 
OR tendinitis OR tendinosis OR rotator cuff OR supraspinatus 
OR shoulder OR patellar OR Achilles OR lateral epicondylosis 
OR lateral epicondylitis OR lateral epicondylopathy OR tennis 
elbow)’. Medical Subject Headinngs (MeSH)terms were not used 
to minimise the risk of missing relevant articles. Review articles 
were used to identify eligible articles that were missed at the initial 
search. Additionally, reference list screening and citation tracking 
in Google Scholar was performed for each relevant article.
screening
From an initial total of 106 articles that were independently 
identified by two reviewers (DC and DB), after exclusion of 
duplicate and non-eligible articles, title and abstract screening 
and addition of missed studies identified by review articles, refer-
ence list screening and citation tracking, 10 studies were found 
to fulfil the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Figure 1 illustrates 
the article screening process according to PRISMA guidelines.20
Quality assessment
A thorough quality assessment of the studies was conducted: all 
internal validity (freedom from bias), external validity (generalis-
ability/applicability) and precision (reproducibility/freedom from 
random error) were assessed separately by two of the authors 
independently (DC and DB), and a third independent opinion 
(MM and CC) was sought where disagreements existed. Quality 
scales and resulting scores were not used as these usually combine 
aspects of study methodology with aspects of reporting; there-
fore, they are thought to be inappropriate for assessment of study 
quality.21–23 In addition, score cut-offs classifying studies of good 
or poor quality are usually not provided, and consequently, these 
are usually made up by the author of the review article, which can 
be highly variable. For internal validity, the ‘Cochrane Collabora-
tion’s tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials’ was used, 
which includes six questions/criteria assessing the risk of six specific 
and one non-specific (‘other’) types of bias.21 As ‘other’ bias, our 
preset assessment criteria were: (A) adequate and appropriate inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria, (B) differences between treatment and 
control groups at baseline (confounding) and (C) appropriateness 
of statistical tests deployed. External validity was assessed based on 
the population, age range and clinical relevance of interventions 
and outcome measures. For the assessment of precision the sample 
size, performance of statistical power calculation and p values that 
were used to define statistical significance were taken into account. 
In the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool, each item is classified as of 
‘high’, ‘low’ or ‘unclear’ risk of bias. No total scores are given. 
As with the assessment of internal validity, external validity and 
precision of each study were separately rated as of ‘high’, ‘low’ or 
‘unclear’ risk of bias.
Overall, studies were characterised as of ‘good’, ‘moderate’ or 
‘poor’ quality based on a combined assessment of their internal 
validity, external validity and precision, which was again conducted 
by two of the authors independently (DC and DB) and the opinion 
of a third author (MM) was provided where the two judgements 
differed. The criteria used for overall quality assessment were as 
follows: ‘Good’ quality studies had ‘high’ risk of bias in <2 of the 
seven internal validity categories, external validity and precision; 
‘Moderate’ quality studies had ‘high’ risk bias in 2 of the seven 
internal validity categories, external validity and precision; ‘Poor’ 
quality studies had ‘high’ risk of bias in >2 of the seven internal 
validity categories, external validity and precision.
Data extraction: handling
Each of the eligible articles was initially read by the first author 
to gain familiarity, and subsequently each article was reread, and 
their key characteristics and findings were extracted and inserted in 
tables to facilitate analysis and presentation. For the presentation of 
results, outcomes were divided into short term and midterm, where 
follow-up findings at 2–8 weeks and 12–24 weeks were reported, 
respectively. Results for acute (symptoms less than 6 weeks) and 
chronic (symptoms more than 3 months) tendinopathy are also 
presented separately. For the classification of strength of evidence 
for each outcome reported, the rating system formulated by van 
T
ulder et al24–26 was used, which consists of four levels of evidence: 
strong evidence (level 1) is provided by generally consistent find-
ings in multiple high-quality RCT
s. Moderate evidence (level 2) is 
provided by generally consistent findings in one high-quality RCT 
and one or more low-quality RCT
s or by generally consistent find-
ings in multiple low-quality RCT
s. Limited or conflicting evidence 
(level 3) is provided by only one RCT (either high or low quality) 
or by inconsistent findings in multiple RCT
s. No evidence (level 
4) is defined by the absence of RCT
s. As our overall quality assess-
ment included a ‘moderate’ quality category, we extended level 2 to 
evidence provided by generally consistent findings in high-quality 
RCT and 1 or more low-quality or moderate quality RCT
s or 
multiple moderate quality RCT
s. T
wo of the authors (DC and DB) 
jointly decided on the level of evidence for each outcome based 
on the aforementioned system without any disagreements. Results 
were considered to be significant when they were based on either 
moderate or strong evidence.
ResulTs
Table 1 and 2 and illustrate the characteristics of the included 
studies. A total of 10 eligible studies (figure 1) were identified 
with a total of n=584 participants (mean 58.4±38.1); of these, 
n=343 received GTN patches and n=241 
control/no treatments 
(n=197 
placebo patches, n=24 
local corticosteroid injections, 
n=20 
no treatment) (table 2). A total of n=317 participants in six 
studies27–30 received concurrent tendon rehabilitation (including 
eccentric strengthening exercises), n=154 in one study31 received 
concurrent stretching exercises and n=113 in three studies13 32 33 
received no additional therapy (table 2). These additional ther-
apies were thought to be administered at similar intensity and 
frequency in both treatment and placebo arms. T
wo of the studies 
assessed the effects of topical GTN on acute rotator cuff tendi-
nopathy (n=68 participants) and the remaining eight on chronic 
tendinopathy (n=516; one study on patellar tendinopathy, two 
studies on rotator cuff tendinopathy, two studies on Achilles 
tendinopathy and three studies on lateral elbow tendinopathy). 
Dosages of topical GTN used varied from 0.72 
mg/day – 5 
mg/
day (median 3.13 
mg/day). Publication years ranged from 1996 
to 2014. In the description of study findings, mean values of 
the most clinically relevant outcome measures of treatment and 
placebo groups at baseline and the longest follow-up time-point 
are presented where available. Mean values of visual analogue 
scale (VAS) for pain, which was the outcome measure used by 
most of the studies, at baseline and longest follow-up time-point 
for treatment and placebo groups are presented separately in 
table 3 along with the ‘treatment effect’ for pain, which we calcu-
lated using the following formula: (mean VAS of treatment group 
at follow-up – mean VAS of treatment group at baseline) – (mean 
VAS of placebo group at follow-up – mean VAS of placebo group

Quality assessment
The quality assessment tools used are shown in table 4. Four 
studies were found to be of ‘poor’ overall quality, two of 
‘moderate’ quality and four of ‘good’ quality.
Internal validity
Selection bias
All 10 studies were randomised. Three of the studies13 28 34 
did not report any details about their randomisation method, 
while another three studies either stated ‘with coded randomis-
ation’27 29 or ‘with sealed envelopes’30 without providing further 
details. Risk of bias with regard to allocation concealment 
was ‘low’ in four studies; the remaining six were classified as 
‘unclear’ risk as details were not provided.
Performance bias
T
wo of the 10 studies were not double-blinded (‘high’ risk); 
one of them compared topical GTN with local corticosteroid 
injection32 and the other did not use placebo patches.30 Of the 
eight double-blinded studies, four failed to mention whether 
the active and placebo patches were indistinguishable from each 
other.27 28 33 34 (‘unclear’ risk).
Detection bias
Blinding of outcome measures was thought to be sufficient in 
seven studies (‘low’ risk) where the authors specifically state that 
the outcome assessors/examiners were blinded and/or did not 
participate in the assessment.13 27–29 31 33 34
Attrition bias
Reasons for dropouts/withdrawals of participants were adequately 
reported in all studies (‘low’ risk). Rate of follow-up completion 
was stated in all but three studies, wherein it was assumed to be 
100% as suggested by their results tables.13 32 34. All studies had 
rates of follow-up completion greater than 80% (low risk; range 
82.5%–100%). In the study by Giner-Pascual et al,33 only 66.7% 
completed treatment; however, some of the patients who dropped 
out participated in postintervention assessments resulting in 
follow-up completion of 91% (‘high’ risk).
Reporting bias
Reporting of results was appropriate and adequate in all but one 
study; Berrazueta et al13 failed to provide statistical values for 
range of movement (ROM) and numerical or statistical values 
for hours of sleep. Despite adequate reporting of results, most 
studies were classified as ‘high’ risk of reporting bias due to 
selective reporting; they either failed to provide graphic illustra-
tion of significant results13 27 29 measured and reported a small 
number of outcomes30 33–35 or was terminated too early due to 
lack of significant findings.31
Other bias
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were thought to be adequate 
for all but one study, which only used as an inclusion crite-
rion age more than 18 years and did not describe how the 
diagnosis of tendinopathy (lateral elbow tendinopathy) was 
made.27 T
wo studies did not exclude patients who had previous 
surgery or local corticosteroid injections,13 33 and the authors 
of one study state that ‘patients were excluded if they had any

previous interventions such as local corticosteroid injection’, 
but it is not clear whether those who had previous surgery were 
excluded. Statistical comparison of treatment and control groups 
at baseline was thought to be inadequate in four studies: one 
did not perform a between-group comparison at baseline,13 
two reported a comparison of demographics but not results 
of outcome measures31 33 and one presented a comparison of 
results of outcome measures but not demographics.27
External validity
General, non-specific populations were used in all studies but 
one, which included wheelchair user patients with complete 
motor paraplegia only.33 Age ranges of participants were wide 
enough to allow for good generalisability in all studies except 
for Steunebrink et al,35 where only young patients (18–40 years) 
were recruited. However, we do recognise that this age range 
is reflective of the population suffering from patellar tendinop-
athy (athletes in jumping sports). Clinically relevant assessment 
tools for pain were used in all studies apart from that by Pons 
et al,32 wherein only difference in pain was assessed with the 
use of an ‘analogue visual scale’, further details of which are 
not provided. Tendon-specific outcome measures were only used 
by five studies26 28 30 33 36 and functional questionnaires (Patient-
Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEV) and Victorian Institute 
of Sports Assessment – Patella (VISA-P)) by two studies.30 36 No 
guidelines exist about the best formulation or dosage of topical 
GTN in clinical practice; therefore, all dosages used were consid-
ered clinically relevant.
Precision
Statistical power calculation prior to recruitment was performed 
in all but three studies,13 30 33 where performed sample sizes 
were adequate for a power of at least 80%. Levels of signifi-
cance were set at p=0.05 in all studies; Paoloni et al31 do not 
explicitly state their defined level of significance; however, this 
is assumed to be (at least) 0.05 as they consider their finding of 
p=0.04 
significant.

T
wo published studies investigated the effects of topical GTN 
on acute rotator cuff tendinopathy. Berrazueta et al13 found that 
at 24-hour 48-hour follow-up versus baseline: (A) the treat-
ment group had significantly reduced intensity and duration of 
pain compared with placebo; (B) the treatment group displayed 
increased shoulder ROM in contrast to placebo; and (C) the 
treatment group had slightly improved hours of sleep compared 
with baseline versus placebo. When the effects of treatment 
were assessed 15 days following the 3-day intervention, all 10 
patients in the treatment group were asymptomatic compared 
with 50% of patients in the control group. T
wo patients (20%) 
in the treatment group reported headache compared with 0 in 
the control group. In their study, Pons et al32 repeated treatment 
up to three times at 15-day intervals when response was only 
partial, and pain was tested 7–10 days after treatment. In the 
corticosteroid group, ‘complete’ improvement was observed 
in 19 patients (79%), ‘partial’ (reduction by 3–5 points) in 3 
 
patients (12%) and treatment failure (reduction by <3 points) 
in 2 patients (8%). In the GTN group, five patients (21%) had 
‘complete’ improvement, 5 (21%) ‘partial’ improvement and 
treatment failed in 14 patients (58%). Headache was reported 
by 15 patients (62%) in the GTN group, of whom 8 (33%) had

The statistical significance column (p<0.05) denotes whether there was a significant benefit in VAS for pain with topical GTN versus placebo.
*Due to the reverse VAS scale used (0=worst pain and 10=no pain), our subtraction was also reverse, that is, (VAS 1 – VAS 2) – (VAS 3 – VAS 4).
†In this study, only the mean VAS values of the highest strength GTN (3.6 mg/24 hours) group are presented for all pain with activity, at rest and at night; however, the lowest 
strength GTN group did have significantly less pain with activity at follow-up compared with placebo.
‡The VAS scale used is not stated in the article, but we assume based on the reported values and the previous article by the same group (were a VAS scale of 0–4 was used) that 
it is 0–40.

Overall, for acute rotator cuff tendinopathy only data on 
short-term outcomes are available from two studies of poor 
overall quality. Compared with placebo, topical GTN appears to 
be superior with respect to pain, ROM, hours of sleep and satis-
faction (level 3 evidence). Compared with local corticosteroid 
injections, GTN appears to be less effective in improving pain 
(level 3 evidence).
Chronic tendinopathy
Rotator cuff
T
wo studies investigated the effects of topical GTN on chronic 
rotator cuff tendinopathy. In the study by Paoloni et al,29 at 
2-week and 6-week follow-up, the only significant differences 
in the treatment group, compared with the control group, 
were an increased supraspinatus force and subscapularis force, 
respectively. At 12 weeks, the treatment group exhibited greater 
supraspinatus, subscapularis, adduction, internal rotation (IR) 
and external rotation (ER) force and less pain at rest and at 
night compared with control. At 24 weeks, the treatment group, 
compared with control, had: (A) less pain at rest, at night and 
with activity, (B) greater supraspinatus, subscapularis, ER, 
adduction and IR force, (C) greater ROM in abduction and IR 
and (D) less impingement in IR (Hawkins sign). Comparing 
treatment and control groups to baseline, at 24 weeks: (A) the 
former group had a significantly higher chance of being asymp-
tomatic, (B) excellent improvement in pain was observed in 46% 
versus 24%, overall passive ROM increased by 24% versus 8%, 
(C) overall shoulder force increased by 29% versus 12% and 
(D) overall impingement signs decreased by 76% versus 43%, 
respectively. At week 24, the treatment group was significantly 
more likely to be asymptomatic with activities of daily living than 
the control group (46% vs 24%). The mean estimated effect size

for all outcomes was 0.26. Headaches were reported by 58% 
patients in the treatment group and 33% in the control group 
and rashes by 12% and 4%, respectively.
In a subsequent study in wheelchair user patients with chronic 
rotator cuff tendinopathy, Giner-Pascual et al33 reported favourable 
outcomes of topical GTN. Mean differences in WUSPI scores were 
also significant in the two groups between baseline and follow-up in 
favour of the GTN group. Comparing shoulder ROM at follow-up 
versus baseline, patients in the treatment group displayed signifi-
cant increases in all directions as opposed to those in the control 
group, where a decrease was observed. The following side effects 
were reported in the treatment group: (A) headache 33% (vs 21% 
in control group) and (B) facial reddening 3%, tachycardia 3% and 
dizziness 3%.
Overall for chronic rotator cuff tendinopathy short-term 
outcomes from one study of good overall quality, showed the 
only significant difference between topical GTN and placebo 
was a greater subscapularis force in patients using GTN (level 
3 evidence). Midterm outcomes were assessed by two studies, 
one of good29 and one of poor33 overall quality; significant 
results included less pain (level 3 evidence), higher ROM (level 2 
evidence), higher overall force (level 3 evidence), higher satisfac-
tion rates (level 3 evidence) and higher chances of being asymp-
tomatic with activities of daily living (ADLs) (level 3 evidence) in 
patients using topical GTN versus placebo.
Patellar
The study by Steunebrink et al35 is the only one investigating 
the effects of topical GTN on chronic patellar tendinopathy. 
At 24-week follow-up, both groups exhibited increases in the 
primary outcome (VISA-P score), but differences between them 
were non-significant (mean VISA-P in GTN group 63 at baseline 
and 75 at 24 weeks vs 67.8 and 80.7, respectively, in placebo 
group). Similarly, VAS scores and patient satisfaction rates 
(secondary outcomes) improved over time with no difference 
between the two groups. The only reported side effect was a 
rash in 19% patients in the treatment group.
In summary, no significant differences in short-term or 
midterm outcomes were identified in patients receiving topical 
GTN versus those receiving placebo patches by one study of 
moderate overall quality (level 3 evidence).
Achilles
T
wo RCTs assessed the effects of topical GTN on chronic 
Achilles tendinopathy. In the study by Kane et al,30 both groups 
had lower scores at the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) VAS 
scale for both pain and disability (mean AOS disability score in 
GTN group 3.5 at baseline and 2.25 at follow-up vs 3.95 and 
2.15, respectively, in placebo group) at follow-up; however, 
no differences were detected between the two groups. In the 
treatment group, four patients (20%) had to discontinue patch 
application due to headaches, while no headaches were reported 
in the control group. Four patients in the treatment group and 
three in the control group went on to have surgical decompres-
sion as their symptoms had not improved after 6 months of 
treatment, and Achilles tendon samples were sent for histology 
and immunohistochemistry. No differences were found between 
the two groups in neovascularisation, fibroblast activity, collagen 
synthesis or production of e-NOS and i-NOS.
In the other RCT of chronic Achilles tendinopathy by Paoloni 
et al,28 compared with the placebo group, the treatment group 
had a significant decrease in: (A) Achilles tendon pain at night at 
12 weeks; (B) pain with activity at 12 weeks and 24 weeks; (C) 
pain after the 10-hop test at 24 weeks; and (D) Achilles tendon 
tenderness at 12 weeks. Additionally, at 24 weeks, compared 
with baseline, the treatment group had a greater increase in 
plantar flexor mean total work than the placebo group. Finally, 
at 24 weeks, patients in the treatment group had a significantly 
higher chance of being asymptomatic with ADLs compared with 
those in the control group (78% vs 49%). Side effects were 
non-significant in treatment versus control groups: (A) headache 
53% versus 45%, (B) rash 16% versus 12% and (C) increase in 
pre-existing tinnitus 3% versus 0%.
Overall, for chronic Achilles tendinopathy short-term 
outcomes comparing the use of topical GTN with placebo were 
reported by one study of good overall quality and no signifi-
cant differences were detected in any of the outcomes (level 3 
evidence). Midterm outcomes were reported by two studies: 
one of good28 and one of poor overall quality30; significant find-
ings favouring GTN over placebo were reduced pain at night 
and with activity (level 3 evidence), local tenderness (level 3 
evidence), increased force (level 3 evidence) and satisfaction 
(level 3 evidence) and higher chances of being asymptomatic 
with ADLs (level 3 evidence).
Lateral elbow tendinopathy
Three RCTs investigated the effects of topical GTN therapy on 
chronic lateral elbow tendinopathy (‘tennis elbow’). Paoloni 
et al27 found that elbow pain with activity decreased signifi-
cantly in both groups at all 2, 6, 12 and 24 weeks follow-up; 
however, a between-groups difference was only significant at 2 
weeks, in favour of the treatment group. Similarly, both groups 
displayed significantly decreased lateral epicondyle tenderness at 
all follow-up stages compared with baseline; these decreases in 
the treatment group were significant compared with the placebo 
group only at weeks 6 and 12. Based on patient-reported 
outcomes, the treatment group was more likely to be asymp-
tomatic with ADLs at week 24 compared with the control group 
(81% vs 60%, respectively). The mean estimated effect size for 
all treatment outcomes at week 24 was 0.12. Side effects were 
reported by treatment and placebo groups, respectively: head-
aches 63% versus 58%, rash 21% versus 9%, facial flushing 2% 
versus 0%, ipsilateral axillary sweating 2% versus 0% and appre-
hension 2% versus 0%.
Six years later, the same group31 conducted the largest RCT of 
its kind with 136 patients. According to the authors, the inter-
ventions were initially planned to be administered for 24 weeks; 
however, the study was abandoned at 8 weeks due to lack of 
significant results. Of all study outcomes (Subjective Global 
Assessment of Change, pain, PRTEV and strength), the only 
significant between-groups difference was a significant decrease 
in pain with activity at 8 weeks in the 0.72 
mg/day GTN group 
compared with placebo. Mean pain-free grip strength (primary 
outcome) in the highest dosage GTN group was 23.1 at base-
line and 30.5 at follow-up versus 22.9 and 27.4, respectively, in 
the placebo group. The authors did not report overall incidence 
of side effects; however, dropouts due to side effects were as 
follows: headache: n=2 (6%) in 1.44 
mg/day GTN group and 
n=5 (11%) in 3.6 
mg/day GTN group and dermatitis rash: n=1 
(2%) in 3.6 
mg/day GTN group.
In a recent study by Ozden et al,34 compared with baseline, 
both treatment and placebo groups had significant decreases in 
their pain VAS scores at both follow-up stages. The treatment 
group had significantly lower pain VAS scores compared with the 
placebo group at both 3 weeks and 6 months. Finally, at 6 months, 
95% of patients in the treatment group reported excellent or good

outcomes compared with 15% in the control group. Headaches 
were reported by 5% patients in the treatment group and 10% in 
the control group, of which no one had to abandon the study.
Overall for chronic lateral elbow tendinopathy, a total of 
three studies (two of good and one of moderate overall quality) 
compared short-term outcomes of topical GTN therapy versus 
placebo; significant differences favouring topical GTN include 
less pain (unspecified; level 3 evidence) and less pain with 
activity (level 2 evidence). T
wo studies (one of good and one 
of moderate overall quality) also described midterm outcomes; 
patients who received topical GTN had significantly less pain 
(level 3 evidence) and local tenderness (level 3 evidence) as well 
as greater force (level 3 evidence), satisfaction (level 2 evidence) 
and chances of being asymptomatic with ADLs (level 3 evidence) 
compared with those treated with placebo patches.
A summary of the results of the included studies on different 
patient-related outcomes is shown in table 5.
DIsCussIOn
The results of this systematic review provide good evidence for 
the effectiveness of topical GTN for the treatment of tendinop-
athies compared with placebo in the short and intermediate 
term (<6 months). Treatment with topical GTN for 12–24 
weeks was associated with increased ROM in chronic rotator 
cuff disease (moderate strength evidence), and for all chronic 
tendinopathies topical GTN had positive effects on satisfac-
tion (strong evidence), chances of being asymptomatic with 
ADLs (strong evidence), unspecified pain (moderate strength 
evidence), ROM (moderate strength evidence) and tendon force 
(moderate strength evidence). Pain at rest was unaffected by 
treatment with topical GTN for the same period for all chronic 
tendinopathies (strong evidence); however, it should be remem-
bered that tendons are rarely painful at rest but typically when 
loaded, and thus this finding may not be clinically relevant. 
Overall effects of topical GTN on pain at night, pain with activity 
and local tenderness may also be beneficial; however, this is only 
based on poor strength evidence. Effects of treatment for shorter 
periods (<8 weeks) seem to be less pronounced. Equally, conclu-
sions on the effects of topical GTN on acute tendinopathies could 
not be drawn due to the lack of high-quality evidence; however, 
there may be benefits in pain, ROM and sleep in patients with 
acute rotator cuff disease based on a single study with high risk 
of bias (poor strength evidence). Finally, with regard to side 
effects, topical GTN seems to be associated with a higher inci-
dence of headaches (moderate strength evidence) while its effect 
on rashes seemed to be non-significant; however, this was only 
based on evidence of poor strength.
Long-term effects of topical GTN in tendinopathy have 
only been assessed by two prospective studies, which were 
not included in the present review as they did not fulfil the 
eligibility criteria37 38 (non-RCTs). Paoloni et al37 followed 
up 52 of the participants (80%) of their previous study28 that 
compared the effects of topical GTN and placebo patches on 
Achilles tendinopathy 3 years later. Additionally, the authors 
included an assessment using the Victorian Institute of Sports 
Assessment – Achilles (VISA-A) scale; however, they did not 
perform measurements of plantar flexor peak force and plantar 
flexor work. Compared with the control group (n=28), the 
GTN group (n=24) had significantly decreased tenderness, 
a higher mean VISA-A score and a greater chance of being 
asymptomatic with ADLs (88% vs 67%). All other outcome 
measures showed a non-significant trend towards improve-
ment. The estimated mean effect size of all outcome measures 
at 3 years for topical GTN was 0.21. Similarly, McCallum et 
al38 followed up a total of 58 participants (67%) from their 
previous study27 on lateral elbow tendinopathy 5 years after its 
completion and performed the same assessments. The authors 
found that the improvements in all outcome measures, which 
were reported at 6 months (pain with activity, local tender-
ness, wrist extensor peak force and total work), were sustained 
at 5 years; however, no significant differences were detected 
between the treatment and control groups. This suggests that 
this improvement in both groups was most likely a direct result 
of the tendon rehabilitation that all participants received and/
or time. The most important limitation of these prospective 
studies was that certain patients received additional treat-
ments (more GTN patches, extracorpeal shock wave  therapy 
(ESWT), acupuncture, herbal therapies and surgery), which 
were not adjusted for and could have confounded the results.
The findings of previously published reviews assessing the 
effects of topical GTN on tendinopathy are partly in agreement 
with our results. A systematic review and meta-analysis of seven 
RCTs on all types of tendinopathy19 concluded that there is 
strong evidence that topical GTN relieves pain during activity 
and increases tendon strength. We have now included another 
three studies that were published in the interim and used a 
different approach in assessing the quality of studies; in contrast 
to Gambito et al,19 we refrained from using quality scales and 
resulting scores as these usually assess study reporting in addi-
tion to study methodology; therefore, they are thought to be 
inappropriate for assessment of study quality. A recent system-
atic review and meta-analysis of 22 RCTs39 comparing the effects 
of all non-surgical treatments (including topical GTN) to no 
treatment in lateral elbow tendinopathy reported no significant 
intermediate to long-term benefits of non-surgical treatments 
over observation only or placebo. Equally, another systematic 
review of 12 RCTs looking at the effects of pharmacological 
interventions for Achilles tendinopathy12 concluded that there 
is lack of significant evidence to support the use of any of the 
therapies studied (topical GTN and injections of platelet rich 
plasma (PRP), autologous blood, polidocanol, corticosteroid, 
aprotinin, prolotherapy and fibroblasts) as they provided no 
significant benefits in terms of pain, disability, quality of life or 
histological changes compared with no treatment.
Finally, it is important given our incomplete understanding 
of the mechanisms underpinning tendon pathophysiology to 
consider the mechanism of action of GTN in the setting of 
tendon disease. Following injury to a tendon, NO is produced 
by all three isoforms of NOS17: NOS activity is upregulated in 
tendinopathy.15 In an exercise-overuse model of tendon degener-
ation, i-NOS, e-NOS and b-NOS mRNAs were overexpressed in 
the supraspinatus tendon of rats subjected to treadmill running 
for 14 
days40. Expression of all isoforms was confirmed in human 
tendon disease from biopsy samples taken during shoulder 
surgery,16 while cultured human tenocytes exposed to exog-
enous NO increased total collagen synthesis.41 This supports 
the notion that NO enhances extracellular matrix synthesis and 
results in injured tendons having better material and mechan-
ical properties. Despite these useful ‘preclinical’ findings, little 
follow-up work has been done to elucidate the optimum method 
of delivery of NO to tendons in an attempt to realise clinical 
efficacy. Thus, further work is required to move pastsimple 
‘patch’ therapy, which suffers issues with drug delivery dosages, 
and ongoing trialss may well help answer these queries (

Review
studies, we do recognise its limitations. First, due to the small 
number of eligible studies, our results on most outcomes had a 
poor level of evidence, especially for specific types of tendinop-
athies. Additionally, the different dosages of topical GTN and 
outcome measures used resulted in lack of homogeneity, which 
made the conduction of a meta-analysis impossible. Finally, the 
effects of the concurrent physiotherapy (eccentric and stretching 
exercises) that most participants received might have affected 
the results, even though, where used, both treatment arms were 
instructed to perform the same exercises at the same frequency 
and intensity, the actual frequency, intensity and correct perfor-
mance of the exercises were not assessed.
COnClusIOn
The results of this review provide good evidence for the effec-
tiveness of GTN in the short and intermediate term treatment 
of tendinopathies (<6 
months). GTN treatment is thus a good 
example that translational tendinopathy (laboratory bench to 
patient) can provide pharmacological adjuncts to aid the prac-
tising healthcare professional in addition to loading regimes. 
Importantly, other than headaches and occasionally rashes, 
topical GTN is a safe and practical treatment modality with very 
low costs both for the patient and the healthcare system. There-
fore, the use of topical GTN should be considered for all chronic 
tendinopathies as an adjunct to loading programmes that fail to 
produce satisfactory resolution of symptoms. However, physi-
cians should alert patients that large, well-designed RCTs and 
prospective cohort studies are warranted to provide convincing 
evidence on the effects of topical GTN in both acute and chronic 
tendinopathy, especially its long-term outcomes.
What is already known
 
► Twenty years since concept of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) 
therapy in tendinopathy with still no clear guidance/evidence 
of efficacy.
New findings
 
► Ten eligible randomised controlled trials in all tendinopathies 
reveal improved midterm (up to 6 months) improvements in 
pain, strength and patient satisfaction.
 
► Main adverse event is headaches in up to one in five patients.
 
► Topical GTN is useful for all chronic tendinopathies as 
an adjunct to loading programmes that fail to produce 
satisfactory resolution of symptoms.
