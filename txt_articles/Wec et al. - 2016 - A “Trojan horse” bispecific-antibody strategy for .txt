Abstract
There is an urgent need for monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies that broadly protect against 
Ebola virus and other filoviruses. The conserved, essential interaction between the filovirus 
glycoprotein, GP, and its entry receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) provides an attractive target for 
such mAbs but is shielded by multiple mechanisms, including physical sequestration in late 
endosomes. Here, we describe a bispecific-antibody strategy to target this interaction, in which 
mAbs specific for NPC1 or the GP receptor–binding site are coupled to a mAb against a 
conserved, surface-exposed GP epitope. Bispecific antibodies, but not parent mAbs, neutralized all 
known ebolaviruses by coopting viral particles themselves for endosomal delivery and conferred

 postexposure protection against multiple ebolaviruses in mice. Such “Trojan horse” bispecific 
antibodies have potential as broad antifilovirus immunotherapeutics.
The development of therapeutics targeting Ebola virus (EBOV) and other filoviruses is a 
global health priority. The success of ZMapp—a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies 
(mAbs) targeting the EBOV surface glycoprotein GP—in reversing Ebola virus disease in 
nonhuman primates (NHPs) has underscored the promise of antiviral immunotherapy (1). 
However, most available mAbs have a narrow antiviral spectrum, because they recognize 
variable surface-exposed GP epitopes (2). ZMapp protects against EBOV but not against 
other filoviruses with known epidemic potential, including the ebolaviruses Bundibugyo 
virus (BDBV) and Sudan virus (SUDV) and the more divergent marburgviruses. Given the 
scientific and logistical challenges inherent in developing a separate mAb cocktail for each 
filovirus, as well as the need for preparedness against newly emerging or engineered viral 
variants, broadly protective antifilovirus immunotherapies are highly desirable. A few mAbs 
have shown cross-neutralization and protection in rodents, indicating that cross-species 
protection by a single molecule is possible; however, such antibodies are rare (3–8).
An unusual feature of cell entry by filoviruses is the proteolytic cleavage of GP in 
endosomes to reveal “cryptic” epitopes (9, 10), including the receptor-binding site (RBS) 
that engages the critical intracellular receptor, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) (fig. S1) (11-18). 
Engagement of NPC1's second luminal domain, NPC1-C, by this highly conserved RBS in 
cleaved GP (GPcl) is required for cell entry and infection by all filoviruses (11,19–21). 
Consistent with this, MR72, an RBS-specific mAb isolated from a Marburg virus (MARV) 
disease survivor, blocked GPCL-NPC1 interaction in vitro and broadly neutralized viruses 
bearing in vitro cleaved GPCL (15, 22, 23). However, MR72 failed to neutralize infection by 
uncleaved ebolaviruses, likely because it could not gain access to late endosomes, where the 
GPCL RBS becomes unmasked (15). Therefore, the development of broadly protective 
immunotherapies targeting the GPCL-NPC1 interaction is challenged by the endosomal 
sequestration of this virus-receptor complex.
We envisioned a bispecific antibody (bsAb)–engineering strategy to block intracellular 
GPCL-NPC1 interaction by a “Trojan horse” mechanism. We reasoned that, by coupling 
receptor or RBS–targeting mAbs to a delivery mAb directed against a broadly conserved 
epitope in uncleaved GP, virions themselves could be coopted to transport bsAbs to the 
appropriate endosomal compartments (Fig. 1, A and B). To block the filovirus-receptor 
interaction, we chose mAbs targeting both its viral and host facets: MR72, a human mAb 
that recognizes the GPCL RBS (above), and mAb-548, a novel murine mAb that engages 
human NPC1-C. mAb-548 bound with picomolar affinity to an NPC1-C epitope that 
overlaps the GPCL-binding interface and blocked GPCL–NPC1-C association in vitro at pH 
5.5, the presumptive pH of late endosomes (figs. S1 and S2). mAb-548 resembled MR72 in 
its lack of neutralizing activity against uncleaved viruses (Fig. 2, A and B, and fig. S6), 
likely because NPC1 is absent from the cell surface (11,24). To deliver mAb-548 and MR72 
to endosomes, we selected the macaque mAb FVM09, which recognizes a conserved linear 
epitope in the GP glycan cap of all known ebola-viruses (Fig. 1A and fig. S4) (8). FVM09 
does not neutralize infection and confers limited in vivo protection against EBOV (8).

 The heavy- and light-chain variable domains (VH and VL, respectively) of FVM09 were 
used to mAb-548 and MR72 by using the dual–variable domain immunoglobulin (DVD-Ig) 
esign strategy (25). The DVD-Ig format was chosen as a test case because it allows bivalent 
binding of both combining sites but does not use long polypeptide linkers that may be 
susceptible to proteolysis or immunogenic presentation. The FVM09∼548 and 
FVM09∼MR72 DVD-Igs could be readily iso-lated from transiently transfected human 
embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells (fig. S3A). Size-exclusion chromatography-
multiangle light scattering indicated a monodisperse population of monomers, with some 
higher aggregate present (fig. S3, B and C). Each DVD-Ig could bind to EBOV GP via the 
FVM09 “outer” variable domains, with no loss of affinity relative to the parent FVM09 
immunoglobulin G (IgG), as determined by biolayer interferometry (BLI) (Fig. 1C and table 
S1). FVM09∼548 could recognize human NPC1-C, by means of its “inner” variable 
domains, with a subpicomolar equilibrium dissociation constant (KD). The MR72 variable 
domains also retained subnanomolar affinity toward GPCL in the DVD-Ig format Two-phase 
binding studies, in which each DVD-Ig was first exposed to EBOV GP and then to NPC1-C 
or GPCL (Fig. 1D), indicated that there were no steric restrictions to engagement of both 
combining sites.
We tested the DVD-Igs for their capacity to neutralize infection in human cells by 
recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses bearing EBOV GP (rVSV-EBOV GP) or control 
nonfilovirus glycoproteins derived from VSV and Andes hantavirus (Fig. 2, A and B, and 
fig. S5) (26). Both FVM09∼548 and FVM09∼MR72 specifically and potently neutralized 
rVSV-EBOV GP, whereas the parental mAbs FVM09, mAb-548, and MR72 had little or no 
neutralizing activity. Equimolar mixtures of the “delivery” IgG, FVM09, with each receptor-
RBS-targeting IgG (mAb-548 or MR72) also did not neutralize infection (Fig. 2, A and B); 
this indicated that DVD-Ig antiviral activity requires the physical linkage of delivery and 
receptor-RBS–binding specificities. Overall, the DVD-Ig half-maximal inhibitory 
concentration (IC50) values were in the nanomolar range, similar to the measured KD of the 
FVM09-GP complex but higher than those of the mAb-548–NPC1-C and MR72-GPCl 
complexes.
The GPCL-NPC1 interaction is conserved among filoviruses (11, 15, 21, 27, 28), and thus, 
we postulated that the DVD-Igs would exhibit broad neutralizing activity. rVSVs bearing GP 
proteins from the four other ebolaviruses were sensitive to neutralization by both DVD-Igs, 
whereas rVSV–MARV GP was resistant (Fig.2, C, D, and G), consistent with the known 
specificity of FVM09 toward ebolaviruses (8). We next tested the DVD-Igs against authentic 
EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV (Fig. 2, E and F). Each ebolavirus was neutralized by both 
receptor- and RBS-targeting DVD-Igs but not by the individual parent IgGs (Fig. 2G and fig. 
S6).
The success of antibody therapeutics has fueled the development of a panoply of optimized 
bsAb architectures, several of which (including the DVD-Ig) are in clinical trials (29). To 
explore the generality of our strategy to other formats, we generated an FVM09*MR72 
“asymmetric IgG” using the DuoBody platform (figs. S7 and S8) (30). FVM09*MR72 
broadly neutralized rVSVs bearing ebolavirus GPs, albeit with reduced potency against 
SUDV GP, possibly because of its loss of bivalent recognition of GP and/or GPCL.

 Nonetheless, these results illustrate that endosomal targeting of the ebolavirus-receptor 
interaction is amenable to other bispecific-antibody formats.
Our observation that bsAbs combining two nonneutralizing antibodies could confer potent 
neutralization implied critical roles for both binding specificities. This hypothesis is 
supported by three pieces of evidence. First, the activity of the DVD-Igs against rVSV–
EBOV GP particles containing two point mutations in the FVM09 epitope was greatly 
reduced (Fig. 3A and fig. S9). Second, DVD-Igs bearing mAb-548 and MR72 variable 
domains with mutations that abolish binding (FVM09∼548Mut and FVM09∼MR72Mut) 
lacked neutralizing activity (Fig. 3B). Third, FVM09∼548 could not neutralize rVSV–
EBOV GP infection in a cell line bearing supraphysiological levels of NPC1, likely because 
NPC1 overexpression saturates available mAb-548 combining sites (Fig. 3C). Viral 
neutralization by FVM09∼MR72 was unaffected in NPC1-overexpressing cells, consistent 
with the higher affinity of the GPCL-MR72 complex (55 pM) (table S1), relative to the 
GPCL– NPC1-C complex (150 μM) (16).
We postulated that the bsAbs harness extracellular virions for their delivery to endosomal 
sites of filovirus-receptor interaction in the context of natural infection. Accordingly, we 
evaluated the internalization of DVD-Igs and their parent IgGs into cellular endosomes (Fig. 
3D and figs. S10 and S11). Each Ab was covalently labeled with the acid-dependent 
fluorescent probe pHrodo Red and exposed to cells, either alone or following preincubation 
with fluorescent rVSV–EBOV GP particles (19, 26). Cells were measured for both virus- 
and Ab-associated fluorescence by flow cytometry. Virus-negative cells displayed little Ab 
signal; this indicated that neither the DVD-Igs nor their parent IgGs could internalize into 
cells without virions. By contrast, virus-positive cells were strongly positive for the DVD-
Igs but not for the parent mAb-548 and MR72 IgGs. Concordantly, only FVM09 and the 
DVD-Igs could efficiently colocalize with virions (Fig. 3E and fig. S12) or Ebola virus–like 
particles (VLPs) (fig. S13) in NPC1+ late endosomes, where viral membrane fusion takes 
place (19, 31). These results, together with the capacity of FVM09 to bind EBOV GP with 
high affinity between pH 5.5 and 7.5 (fig. S14 and table S1), suggest that virion-bsAb 
complexes remain associated in early endosomes and traffic together to late endosomes, 
where proteolytic removal of the GP glycan cap dislodges FVM09, and where mAb-548 and 
MR72 can engage their respective cellular and viral targets. Collectively, our findings 
support a two-step “deliver-and-block” mechanism for bsAb neutralization.
Finally, we evaluated the protective efficacy of the DVD-Igs in two murine models of lethal 
ebolavirus challenge. Because our prior experiments were conducted in human cells, we first 
tested DVD-Ig neutralization activity in murine NIH/3T3 cells (fig. S15). Whereas 
FVM09∼MR72 retained full activity, FVM09∼548 exhibited poor neutralization in murine 
cells (fig. S15, A and B). This could be readily explained by FVM09∼548's reduced binding 
affinity for the murine NPC1 ortholog (fig. S15C) and consequent reduced capacity to block 
the GPCL-NPC1 interaction (fig. S15E). The discrepancy between binding of mAb-548 to 
human and mouse NPC1 likely arises from species-dependent amino acid sequence 
differences in the mAb-548–binding region of NPC1-C (fig. S16). By contrast, this region in 
human NPC1-C is identical to those of rhesus macaques and crab-eating (cynomolgus) 
macaques (fig. S16), which provide the two NHP models of filovirus challenge currently in

 use. mAb-548 bound strongly to, and inhibited GPCL interaction with, an NHP NPC1 
ortholog derived from the mantled guereza, which also shares an identical mAb-548–binding 
region (fig. S15, D and F). Therefore, although host species–specific differences in NPC1 
binding may affect FVM09∼548's efficacy in rodents, they are unlikely to do so in NHPs 
and humans.
Both DVD-Igs were tested for their capacity to protect BALB/c mice when administered 2 
days after a lethal challenge with EBOV-MA (Fig. 4A) (32). FVM09∼MR72 afforded a high 
level of protection (70%) relative to the untreated group, whereas no significant survival was 
recorded for FVM09∼548 and parent IgG mixtures. We also evaluated the DVD-Igs for 
postexposure protection against a lethal human SUDV isolate in the immunocompromised, 
type 1 interferon α/β receptor–deficient (IFNα/β R−/−) mouse model (Fig. 4B) (7, 33). 
FVM09∼MR72 was fully protective, and FVM09∼548 provided partial protection, relative 
to the untreated group. The limited in vivo efficacy of FVM09∼548 was consistent with its 
reduced capacity to inhibit the GPCL– murine NPC1 interaction (fig. S15). These findings 
provide evidence that a bsAb targeting the critical intracellular virus-receptor interaction can 
confer broad protection against lethal ebola-virus challenge, even under stringent conditions 
of postexposure treatment.
Recent antibody discovery efforts have demonstrated the existence of conserved GP surface 
epitopes that can elicit broadly reactive mAbs with cross-protective potential (3–7, 34). 
Herein, we describe a complementary strategy to generate broadly protective Abs that target 
highly conserved epitopes at the intracellular filovirus-receptor interface, which are normally 
shielded from GP-specific mAbs. Because the cryptic epitope– targeting components of the 
bsAbs engineered in this study block endosomal receptor binding by all known filoviruses 
(15) (this study), next-generation molecules combining them with appropriate delivery 
mAbs of viral or cellular origin may afford coverage against all filoviruses, including newly 
emerging and engineered variants. This Trojan horse bispecific-antibody approach may also 
find utility against other viral pathogens known to use intracellular receptors [e.g., Lassa 
virus (35)], or more generally, to target entry-related virus structural rearrangements that 
occur only in the endolysosomal pathway.

(A) Neutralizing activity of DVD-Igs against rVSVs bearing WT GP or a GP(E288D/
W292R) mutant, in which Asp replaces Glu288 and Arg replaces Trp 292 (see fig. S9). (B) 
Neutralizing activity of mutant DVD-Igs bearing mAb-548 or MR72 combining sites with 
mutations in the third VH complementarity determining region (FVM09∼548Mut and 
FVM09∼MR72Mut, respectively). (C) Neutralizing activity of DVD-Igs against rVSV-
EBOV GP in U2OS cells bearing endogenous levels of NPC1 (NPC1WT) or ectopically 
overexpressing NPC1 (NPC1High). (A) to (C) Averages ± SD for six technical replicates 
pooled from two independent experiments. (D) Internalization of labeled Abs into cells in 
the absence or presence of viral particles. A schematic of the experiment is shown at the left. 
Parent IgGs and DVD-Igs covalently labeled with the acid-dependent fluorophore pHrodo 
Red were incubated with rVSV-EBOV GP particles and exposed to cells. Virus− Ab+ and 
virus+ Ab+ populations were measured by flow cytometry. Averages ± SD for four technical 
replicates pooled from two independent experiments are shown. Group means for the 
percentage of Ab+ cells were compared by two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) (see 
fig. S11). Šídák's post hoc test was used to compare the capacity of each Ab to internalize 
into virus− versus virus+ cell populations (****P < 0.0001; ns, not significant). Dunnett's 
post hoc test was used to compare the internalization of each Ab to that of the “no Ab” 
control in virus+ cell populations (****P < 0.0001; all other Ab versus no Ab comparisons 
were not significant). (E) Delivery of Abs to NPC1+ endosomes. FVM09∼548 was 
incubated with rVSV–EBOV GP particles and exposed to cells expressing an NPC1–
enhanced blue fluorescent protein–2 fusion protein. Viral particles, Ab, and NPC1 were 
visualized by fluorescence microscopy (also see figs. S12 and S13). Representative images 
from two independent experiments are shown. Scale bar, 20 μm.

 Fig. 4. FVM09∼MR72 affords broad postexposure protection from lethal ebolavirus challenge
(A) BALB/c mice were challenged with mouse-adapted EBOV (EBOV-MA), and then 
treated with single doses of parent IgG mixtures [300 mg, ∼15 mg per kilogram body weight 
(mg/kg)] or DVD-Igs (400 μg, ∼20 mg/kg, adjusted for molecular weight), or vehicle 
(phosphate-buffered saline, PBS) at 2 days postchallenge. (B) Type 1 IFNα/β R−/− mice 
were challenged with WT SUDV and then treated with two doses of parent IgG mixtures 
(300 μg total per dose, ∼15 mg/kg); DVD-Igs (400 μg per dose, ∼20 mg/kg); or vehicle 
(PBS) 1 and 3 days post-challenge. “n” indicates the number of animals per group. Data 
from single cohorts are shown. Survival in each group was compared with that in the PBS 
group by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test (*P < 0.05; ***P < 0.001); all other comparisons to the 
untreated group were not significant.
