ugar-sweetened beverages are associated with cardiomet-
abolic diseases,1,2 which may increase the risk of stroke 
and dementia.3,4 Limited prior findings suggest that sugar- and 
artificially sweetened beverages are both associated with an 
increased risk of incident stroke,5 although conflicting find-
ings have been reported.6 To our knowledge, studies are yet 
to examine the associations between sugary beverage con-
sumption and the risk of incident dementia. Accordingly, we 
examined whether sugar- or artificially sweetened soft drinks 
were associated with the 10-year risks of incident stroke and 
dementia in the community-based Framingham Heart Study. 
We also examined total sugary beverages, which combined 
sugar-sweetened soft drinks with noncarbonated high sugar 
beverages, such as fruit juices and fruit drinks.
Methods
The Framingham Heart Study comprises a series of community-
based prospective cohorts originating from the town of Framingham, 
Massachusetts. We studied the Framingham Heart Study Offspring 
cohort, which commenced in 1971 with the enrollment of 5124 vol-
unteers. Participants have been studied across 9 examination cycles 
approximately every 4 years, with the latest cycle concluding in 2014.
We estimated the 10-year risk of both incident stroke and dementia 
beginning from the 7th examination cycle (1998–2001). For the study 
of stroke in relation to beverage intake, we excluded people with 
prevalent stroke or other significant neurological disease at baseline 
Background and Purpose—Sugar- and artificially-sweetened beverage intake have been linked to cardiometabolic risk 
factors, which increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease and dementia. We examined whether sugar- or artificially 
sweetened beverage consumption was associated with the prospective risks of incident stroke or dementia in the 
community-based Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort.
Methods—We studied 2888 participants aged >45 years for incident stroke (mean age 62 [SD, 9] years; 45% men) and 1484 
participants aged >60 years for incident dementia (mean age 69 [SD, 6] years; 46% men). Beverage intake was quantified 
using a food-frequency questionnaire at cohort examinations 5 (1991–1995), 6 (1995–1998), and 7 (1998–2001). 
We quantified recent consumption at examination 7 and cumulative consumption by averaging across examinations. 
Surveillance for incident events commenced at examination 7 and continued for 10 years. We observed 97 cases of 
incident stroke (82 ischemic) and 81 cases of incident dementia (63 consistent with Alzheimer’s disease).
Results—After adjustments for age, sex, education (for analysis of dementia), caloric intake, diet quality, physical activity, 
and smoking, higher recent and higher cumulative intake of artificially sweetened soft drinks were associated with 
an increased risk of ischemic stroke, all-cause dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease dementia. When comparing daily 
cumulative intake to 0 per week (reference), the hazard ratios were 2.96 (95% confidence interval, 1.26–6.97) for 
ischemic stroke and 2.89 (95% confidence interval, 1.18–7.07) for Alzheimer’s disease. Sugar-sweetened beverages were 
not associated with stroke or dementia.
Conclusions—Artificially sweetened soft drink consumption was associated with a higher risk of stroke and 
dementia.

and those <45 years. For investigating the incidence of dementia, we 
excluded people with prevalent dementia, mild cognitive impairment, 
or other significant neurological disease at baseline and those <60 
years. These age cutoffs are consistent with our prior work in this 
area.3 There were 2888 and 1484 participants available for analysis of 
incident stroke and new-onset dementia, respectively (Figure 1). All 
participants provided written informed consent, and the study pro-
cedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at Boston 
University School of Medicine.
Assessment of Sugary Beverage Intake
Participants completed the Harvard semiquantitative food-frequency 
questionnaire (FFQ) at examination cycles 5 (1991–1995), 6 (1995–
1998), and 7 (1998–2001). The FFQ provides a validated measure 
of dietary intake over the past 12 months.7 Participants responded 
according to how frequently they consumed 1 glass, bottle, or can 
of each sugary beverage item, on average, across the previous year. 
The FFQ included 3 items on sugar-sweetened soft drink, 4 items on 
fruit juice, 1 item on noncarbonated sugar-sweetened fruit drinks, and 
3 items on artificially sweetened soft drinks. Each item was scored 
according to 9 responses spanning from never or <1 per month to 
6+ per day. Intake of soft drinks using the FFQ has been validated 
against dietary records (correlation coefficients of 0.81 for Coke/
Pepsi)8,9 and is reliable when readministered after 12 months (cor-
relation coefficients of 0.85 for Coke/Pepsi).8,9
We combined FFQ items to create variables reflecting intake of (1) 
total sugary beverages (combining sugar-sweetened soft drinks, fruit 
juice, and fruit drinks), (2) sugar-sweetened soft drinks (high-sugar 
carbonated beverages, such as cola), and (3) artificially sweetened 
soft drinks (sugar-free carbonated beverages, such as diet cola). We 
created new intake categories to ensure that an adequate number of 
participants were retained in each intake group across each variable. 
Cut points were determined before conducting the main analyses 
based on the relative distribution of intake for each variable. Total 
sugary beverage consumption was examined as <1 per day (refer-
ence), 1 to 2 per day, and >2 per day; sugar-sweetened soft drink 
intake was examined as 0 per week (reference), ≤3 per week, and >3 
per week; and artificially sweetened soft drink intake was examined 
as 0 per week (reference), ≤6 per week, and ≥1/d. We used FFQ data 
obtained from examination cycle 7 as a measure of recent intake. In 
an additional analysis, we also averaged responses across examina-
tion cycles 5, 6, and 7 to calculate cumulative intake over a maximum 
of 7 years. For this later variable, we averaged FFQ data from exami-
nation cycle 7, with FFQ data from at least 1 other examination (5 
or 6). However, we averaged across all 3 examination cycles where 
possible (72% of participants completed all 3 FFQs; n=935 for stroke 
analysis sample and n=755 for dementia analysis sample).
Incident Stroke and Dementia
We related beverage consumption to the 10-year risk of stroke and 
dementia. Surveillance commenced from examination cycle 7 to the 
time of incident event over a maximum of 10 years or until last known 
contact with the participant. We defined stroke as the rapid onset of 
focal neurological symptoms of presumed vascular origin, lasting 
>24 hours or resulting in death. A diagnosis of dementia was made in 
line with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
4th edition.10 A diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia 
was based on the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological 
and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the AD and Related 
Disorders Association for definite, probable, or possible AD.11 Please 
see the online-only Data Supplement for complete details on our 
methods of surveillance, diagnosis, and case ascertainment.
Statistical Analysis
We used SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to estimate Cox pro-
portional hazards regression models (after confirming the assumption 
of proportionality of hazards). Recent intake and cumulative intake of 
total sugary beverages, sugar-sweetened soft drinks, and artificially 
sweetened soft drinks were related separately to the risk of all stroke, 
ischemic stroke, all-cause dementia, and AD dementia. Hazard ratios 
(HR) are presented accompanied by 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
We first performed minimally adjusted statistical models, which 
included adjustments for age, sex, education (for analysis of demen-
tia only), and total caloric intake (Model 1). Next, we stepped in 
adjustments for lifestyle factors, including the Dietary Guidelines 
Adherence Index (a variable quantifying adherence to the 2005 
Dietary Guidelines for Americans), as a measure of overall diet qual-
ity,12 self-reported physical activity,13 and smoking status (Model 2). 
A third statistical model included the adjustments outlined in Model 
Figure 1. Selection of study participants. The risk of incident stroke and dementia were calculated as the 10-year risk, starting from 
examination cycle 7. Cumulative intake was calculated by averaging responses across the FFQ completed at examination cycles 5, 6, 
and 7 (to be included, a participant must have had examination cycle 7 data and at least one of examination cycles 5 or 6). FFQ indicates 
food frequency questionnaire; and MCI, mild cognitive impairment.

1, as well as additional cardiometabolic variables that may be influ-
enced by sugary beverage intake1,2,14,15 or associated with an increased 
risk of stroke or dementia.3,4,16 These variables included systolic blood 
pressure, treatment of hypertension, prevalent cardiovascular disease, 
atrial fibrillation, left ventricular hypertrophy, total cholesterol, high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol, prevalent diabetes mellitus, positivity 
for at least 1 apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (for analysis of dementia only) 
and waist-to-hip ratio (Model 3). All covariates were obtained from 
examination cycle 7. We report Models 2 and 3 as our primary analy-
ses (please see Tables I and II in the online-only Data Supplement for 
Model 1 results).
We explored for interactions between beverage consumption and 
important confounders, including waist-to-hip ratio, apolipoprotein E 
ε4 allele status, and prevalent diabetes mellitus. We considered results 
statistically significant if a 2-sided P<0.05, except for tests of interac-
tion which were considered statistically significant if a 2-sided P<0.1.
Sensitivity Analysis
We performed mediation analyses to examine if any of the following 
covariates mediated the observed associations between cumulative 
intake of artificially sweetened soft drink and the outcomes: prevalent 
hypertension, prevalent cardiovascular disease, prevalent diabetes 
mellitus, waist-to-hip ratio, total cholesterol, and high-density lipo-
protein cholesterol.
Results
Table 1 displays cohort characteristics classified by total sug-
ary beverage and artificially sweetened soft drink intake for 
the larger stroke study sample (see Table III in the online-
only Data Supplement for a summary of the dementia study 
sample). Total caloric intake increased across categories of 
total sugary beverage but not artificially sweetened soft drink 
intake categories. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease 
and diabetes mellitus decreased with more frequent consump-
tion of total sugary beverages but increased with greater con-
sumption of artificially sweetened soft drink.
Sweetened Beverage Consumption 
and the Risk of Stroke
Greater recent consumption of artificially sweetened soft 
drink was associated with an increased risk of stroke, with the

strongest associations observed for ischemic stroke (Table 2). 
Higher cumulative intake of artificially sweetened soft drink 
was also associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke 
(Table 2 and Figure 2). Neither intake of total sugary bever-
ages nor intake of sugar-sweetened soft drink was associated 
with the risks of stroke.
Sweetened Beverage Consumption 
and the Risk of Dementia
When examining cumulative beverage consumption, daily 
intake of artificially sweetened soft drink was associated with 
an increased risk of both all-cause dementia and AD dementia 
in Models 1 and 2 (Table 3; Table II in the online-only Data 
Supplement). However, such associations were no longer sig-
nificant after adjustment for the covariates outlined in Model 
3. With respect to recent beverage intake, daily intake of arti-
ficially sweetened beverages was associated with an increased 
risk of dementia in Model 2 only. Neither total sugary bever-
ages nor sugar-sweetened soft drink was associated with the 
risks of dementia.
Interactions
We did not observe any interactions with waist-to-hip ratio, 
diabetes mellitus status, or the presence of the apolipoprotein 
E ε4 allele with intake of any beverage examined.
Mediation Analysis
Prevalent diabetes mellitus status was identified as a potential 
mediator of the association between artificially sweetened bev-
erage intake and the risk of both incident all-cause dementia and 
AD dementia (see Results in the online-only Data Supplement). 
When repeating the primary analysis excluding those with 
prevalent diabetes mellitus and adjusting for Model 1 covari-
ates, daily intake of artificially sweetened beverages (versus 
no intake) remained a significant predictor of both incident 
all-cause dementia (HR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.07–5.59; N/events, 
53/1148) and AD dementia (HR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.22–8.52; N/
events, 40/1148). Thus, diabetes mellitus was a partial but not 
full mediator of the association between artificially sweetened 
beverage intake and incident dementia. Prevalent hypertension 
was a potential mediator of the association between artificially

disease, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular hypertrophy, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, prevalent diabetes mellitus, and waist to hip ratio. For recent 
intake: N/events for all strokes were 76/2225 for Model 2 and 93/2729 for Model 3. N/events for ischemic stroke were 64/2225 for Model 2 and 78/2729 for Model 3. 
For cumulative intake: N/events for all strokes were 70/2137 for Model 2 and 85/2598 for Model 3. N/events for ischemic stroke were 58/2137 for Model 2 and 70/2598

Discussion
In our community-based cohort, higher consumption of artifi-
cially sweetened soft drink was associated with an increased 
risk of both stroke and dementia. Neither total sugary bever-
ages nor sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption was associ-
ated with the risks of stroke or dementia.
The Nurses Health Study and Health Professionals 
Follow-Up Study reported that greater consumption of sugar- 
and artificially sweetened soft drinks was each independently 
associated with a higher risk of incident stroke over 28 years 
of follow-up for women (N=84 085) and 22 years of follow-up 
for men (N=43 371).5 The Northern Manhattan Study, a popu-
lation-based multiethnic cohort (N=2564), reported that daily 
consumption of artificially sweetened soft drink was associ-
ated with a higher risk of combined vascular events but not 
stroke when examined as an independent outcome.6 Our study 
provides further evidence to link consumption of artificially 
sweetened beverages with the risk of stroke, particularly isch-
emic stroke. To our knowledge, our study is the first to report 
an association between daily intake of artificially sweetened 
soft drink and an increased risk of both all-cause dementia and 
dementia because of AD.
Our observation that artificially sweetened, but not sugar-
sweetened, soft drink consumption was associated with an 
increased risk of stroke and dementia is intriguing. Sugar-
sweetened beverages provide a high dose of added sugar, lead-
ing to a rapid spike in blood glucose and insulin,17 providing a 
plausible mechanism to link consumption to the development 
of stroke and dementia risk factors. Like sugar-sweetened soft 
drinks, artificially sweetened soft drinks are associated with 
risk factors for stroke and dementia,1,14,15 although the mecha-
nisms are incompletely understood, and inconsistent findings 
have been reported.18
Artificially sweetened beverages are typically sweetened 
with non-nutritive sweeteners, such as saccharin, acesulfame, 
aspartame, neotame, or sucralose. At the time of FFQ admin-
istration in this study, saccharin, acesulfame-K, and aspar-
tame were Food and Drug Administration approved, whereas 
sucralose was approved in 1999, neotame in 2002, and stevia 
in 2008.18 Collectively, these synthetic substances are much

Previous studies linking artificially sweetened beverage 
consumption to negative health consequences have been ques-
tioned based on concerns regarding residual confounding and 
reverse causality, whereby sicker individuals consume diet 
beverages as a means of negating a further deterioration in 
health.19 Indeed, in our study, diabetes mellitus—a known risk 
factor for dementia20—was more prevalent in those who regu-
larly consumed artificially sweetened soft drinks. Diabetes 
mellitus status also partially mediated the association between 
artificially sweetened soft drink intake and incident demen-
tia. Because our study was observational, we are unable to 
determine whether artificially sweetened soft drink intake 
increased the risk of incident dementia through diabetes mel-
litus or whether people with diabetes mellitus were simply 
more likely to consume diet beverages. Some studies have 
provided evidence for the former.21 Artificial sweeteners have 
been shown to cause glucose intolerance in mice by altering 
gut microbiota and are associated with dysbiosis and glucose 
intolerance in humans.21 A systematic review and meta-anal-
ysis reported that artificially sweetened beverage consump-
tion was associated with incident diabetes mellitus, although 
publication bias and residual confounding were considered 
possible.14 Clinical trials are needed to establish whether the 
consumption of artificially sweetened beverages is causally 
related to dementia or surrogate end points, such as cognitive 
decline or brain atrophy.
In our study, prevalent hypertension, the single most impor-
tant stroke risk factor, attenuated the association between 
artificially sweetened beverage intake and incident all-stroke, 
although not ischemic stroke. Prospective cohort studies, such 
as the Nurses Health Study, have demonstrated associations 
between higher intake of artificially sweetened beverages 
and an increased risk of incident hypertension.22 However, 
it remains unclear whether artificial sweeteners cause hyper-
tension or whether diet beverages are favored by those most 
at risk. Given that clinical trials involving stroke end points 
are large and costly, clinical trials should investigate whether 
artificially sweetened beverages are associated with important 
stroke risk factors, such as high blood pressure.
Limitations of the study include the absence of ethnic 
minorities, which limits the generalizability of our findings 
to populations of non-European decent. Second, the obser-
vational nature of our study precludes us from inferring 
causal links between artificially sweetened beverage con-
sumption and the risks of stroke and dementia. Third, the 
use of a self-report FFQ to obtain dietary intake data may 
be subject to recall bias, thus, introducing error into our 
estimated models. Fourth, although we addressed confound-
ing in numerous ways, we cannot exclude the possibility of 
residual confounding. Finally, we did not adjust for multiple 
comparisons meaning that some findings may be attributable 
to chance.
In conclusion, artificially sweetened soft drink consump-
tion was associated with an increased risk of stroke and 
dementia. Sugar-sweetened beverages were not associated 
with an increased risk of such outcomes. As the consump-
tion of artificially sweetened soft drinks is increasing in 
the community,23 along with the prevalence of stroke24 and 
dementia,25 future research is needed to replicate our findings 
and to investigate the mechanisms underlying the reported 
associations.
