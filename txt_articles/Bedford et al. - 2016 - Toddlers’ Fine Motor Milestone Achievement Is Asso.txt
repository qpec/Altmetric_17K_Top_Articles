Touchscreen technologies provide an intuitive and attractive source of sensory/cognitive
stimulation for young children. Despite fears that usage may have a negative
impact on toddlers’ cognitive development, empirical evidence is lacking. The current
study presents results from the UK Toddler Attentional Behaviours and LEarning
with Touchscreens (TABLET) project, examining the association between toddlers’
touchscreen use and the attainment of developmental milestones. Data were gathered
in an online survey of 715 parents of 6- to 36-month-olds to address two research
questions: (1) How does touchscreen use change from 6 to 36 months? (2) In toddlers
(19–36 months, i.e., above the median age, n = 366), how does retrospectively reported
age of first touchscreen usage relate to gross motor (i.e., walking), fine motor (i.e.,
stacking blocks), and language (i.e., producing two-word utterances) milestones? In
our sample, the proportion of children using touchscreens, as well as the average
daily usage time, increased with age (youngest quartile, 6–11 months: 51.22% users,
8.53 min per day; oldest quartile, 26–36 months: 92.05% users, average use of
43.95 min per day). In toddlers, aged 19–36 months, age of first touchscreen use was
significantly associated with fine motor (stacking blocks), p = 0.03, after controlling for
covariates age, sex, mother’s education (a proxy for socioeconomic status) as well as
age of early fine motor milestone achievement (pincer grip). This effect was only present
for active scrolling of the touchscreen p = 0.04, not for video watching. No significant
relationships were found between touchscreen use and either gross motor or language
milestones. Touchscreen use increases rapidly over the first 3 years of life. In the current
study, we find no evidence to support a negative association between the age of first
touchscreen usage and developmental milestones. Indeed, earlier touchscreen use,
specifically scrolling of the screen, was associated with earlier fine motor achievement.
Future longitudinal studies are required to elucidate the temporal order and mechanisms
of this association, and to examine the impact of touchscreen use on other, more
fine-grained, measures of behavioral, cognitive, and neural development.

Toddler Touchscreen Use and Developmental Milestones
INTRODUCTION
Family ownership of touchscreen devices such as tablets and
mobile phones has increased in the UK from 7% in 2011 to
71% in 2014 (Ofcom, 2014). Touchscreens provide an intuitive
and attractive source of sensory and cognitive stimulation for
young children (Cristia and Seidl, 2015), and the impact of
such devices on children’
s development is a pressing question
of concern to parents, scientists, and policy makers. Several
prominent voices have sparked fears in the popular press about
the negative impact of such technology (e.g., Carr, 2010; Sigman,
2012; Greenfield, 2015), with one of the most prominent parent-
advisory agencies, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAPs),
advising zero screen time before the age of 2 years (Brown,
2011; Strasburger and Hogan, 2013; although the AAP are
currently in the process of revising the guidelines). This guideline
has been adopted by other government agencies around the
world, including in the UK (Public Health England, 2013),
Canada (Lipnowski et al., 2012), and Australia (Australian
Department of Health and Ageing, 2014). However, empirical
evidence relating early touchscreen use in toddlerhood to delays
in cognitive development is currently lacking. Here, we examine
the relationship between touchscreen use and the achievement of
developmental milestones, using data from a large UK survey: the
Toddler Attentional Behaviours and LEarning with Touchscreens
(TABLET) project.
In line with Ofcom’
s (2014) report pointing to a sharp
increase in the prevalence of household touchscreen devices
(Ofcom, 2014), recent studies suggest that the majority of infants
and toddlers have experienced some degree of exposure to
touchscreens (Ahearne et al., 2015; Cristia and Seidl, 2015; Kabali
et al., 2015). In a sample of 450 babies from a French babylab
(Cristia and Seidl, 2015), 58% of 5- to -24-month-old infants
had used a touchscreen. This is in comparison to an earlier
report that 33% of American infants (birth to 2 years of age)
had used a touchscreen (Rideout, 2013). Frequency of use across
these two samples was similar, with just over 20% of infants and
toddlers experiencing daily use of the touchscreen. A more recent
study using a low income ethnic minority American sample
reported much higher frequencies with 75% of children using a
touchscreen device daily by 2 years of age (Kabali et al., 2015).
This percentage was mirrored (71%) in a diverse socioeconomic
status (SES) hospital-based sample of 12–
36 month-olds from
Northern Ireland (Ahearne et al., 2015).
The type of touchscreen usage also changes with age (Cristia
and Seidl, 2015). Parents report that around 75% of toddlers
use touchscreens to look at photos or to watch videos, with
about 50% actively playing baby-friendly apps. The increase in
active use may be due to developing fine-motor skills (e.g.,
precise finger control), increasing executive function required to
understand the touchscreen interface, as well as the developing
need for more structured sensory reward and stimulation. Motor
developments are demonstrated in the gestures toddlers use to
interact with a screen such as banging the screen (16%), tapping
(71%), dragging (41%), swiping (20%) and pinching (10%), with
all gestures increasing with age (with the exception of a decrease
for the non-deliberate banging gesture; Cristia and Seidl, 2015)
together with the child’
s need for parental assistance decreasing
from 71.8% at 2 years to 57.1% at 4 years of age (Kabali et al.,
2015). These usage statistics suggest that the frequency, type,
and complexity of touchscreen use develops along with general
cognitive development. However, it is not currently known if and
how the two developmental strands interact.
How might toddler touchscreen use influence cognitive
development? Given the relatively recent introduction of
touchscreen devices into the developmental environment of
children, there is currently no research directly assessing the
impact of touchscreen use on early cognitive development.
Empirical evidence from more established media, namely TV
viewing and videogames, suggests that TV screen time is
associated with delayed language (Zimmerman et al., 2007),
poorer health (Strasburger et al., 2012), and attentional problems
(Christakis et al., 2004). However, several of these effects have
been shown to be moderated by factors such as parenting
style (Linebarger et al., 2014), type of content (Linebarger and
Walker, 2005) or coviewing with a parent (Mendelsohn et al.,
2010) and may disappear when confounds such as SES are
factored in Schmidt et al. (2009). Evidence for the impact of
actively playing videogames is similarly mixed. Increased gaming
in older children is related to greater parent/teacher-reported
attentional problems (Swing et al., 2010), as well as memory and
sleep problems (Dworak et al., 2007) but has also been shown
to increase performance on cognitive tests including enhanced
visual processing, attentional, and motor control in adults (Green
and Bavelier, 2008).
Touchscreens combine the interactivity of a videogame with
the non-interactive entertainment of television, but less is known
about the direct impact of touchscreen use on behavior than
these two established forms of media. One recent study in adults
showed that touchscreen phone users (compared to non-users)
have greater activation of the somatosensory cortex in response
to a mechanical touch to the thumb, index finger, and middle
finger (Gindrat et al., 2015). However, increased time spent with
a touchscreen may also have detrimental effects on physical
activity and language. The displacement hypothesis (Strasburger
et al., 2012) states that the time a child spends engaged with a
screen limits the time they have to do other activities, leading
to reduced physical activity (Sisson et al., 2010; although see
Taveras et al., 2007) and reduced face-to-face communication
(Huttenlocher, 1998; Hart and Risley, 2003; Rowe, 2012; Sosa,
2016).
To our knowledge, no studies have directly assessed the
impact of touchscreen use on toddlers’
developmental milestones.
Critically, touchscreen devices can be easily used by children
with relatively immature cognitive and behavioral abilities, at
an age when neural development and plasticity is high (e.g.,
Huttenlocher, 2002). As with TV and videogames, the impact of
touchscreen use on development is likely to be mixed depending
on the type of use (Hirsh-Pasek et al., 2015). In the current
paper we examine two main research questions: (1) How does
touchscreen usage change with age across our full sample of
6- to 36-month-olds? (2) In toddlers (aged 19–
36 months), is
retrospectively reported age of first touchscreen usage associated
with developmental milestones: gross motor (i.e., walking), fine

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
In
total,
715
UK-based
parents
of
6-
to
36-month-old
children completed an online questionnaire asking questions
about demographic information, their child’
s media usage
and retrospectively reported developmental milestones. The
questionnaire was administered between June 2015 and March
2016. The final sample size used in each analysis varied
due to missing data for certain questionnaire elements (see
Table 1). Parents were recruited via the Birkbeck Babylab
database, Goldsmiths’
Babylab database and study advertisements
from various news agencies, magazines and agencies including
National Childbirth Trust (NCT). The study was approved by the
Birkbeck Psychological Sciences’
ethics board.
Demographic Information
Information
was
collected
about

age
(mean
age = 19.52 months, SD = 8.26 months) and sex (336 females),
as well as mother’
s educational level (a proxy for family SES;
“
What is the highest degree or level of education the mother
of the child has completed?”Responses were “
Not applicable,”
N = 3; “
School leaving qualification,”N = 20; “
College,”N = 79;
“
University,”N = 294; and “
Post-graduate,”N = 319).
Touchscreen Usage
Media questions were derived from existing questionnaires
investigating touchscreen usage (Rideout, 2013; Linebarger et al.,
2014; Ofcom, 2014). Parents were asked about (1) number of
devices: ‘
How many touchscreen devices do you have in your
home?’
and ‘
How many of these touchscreen devices belong to
your child?; (2) frequency of child’
s use: ‘
On a typical day, how
long does your child spend using a touchscreen device?’
; and (3)
age of first use: ‘
How old was your child when he/she first did
the following activities on a touchscreen device. . . Scrolled or
touched the screen/Passively watched videos.’
Developmental Milestones
In order to assess the onset of key developmental milestones
without having to complete an entire standardized assessment
(e.g., Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, VABS-II; Sparrow et al.,
2005), critical milestones from motor and language domains were
chosen. All questions took the format: ‘
At what age did he/she
first. . .’
and in the current paper, we use data from one ‘
early’
and one ‘
late’milestone, e.g., ‘
Sit without support’and ‘
Walk
independently’(gross motor), ‘
Pick up a small object with a
pincer grip, i.e., with thumb and forefinger’
and ‘
Stack at least
three small blocks or other small objects; stack must not fall’
(fine motor), ‘
Say their first word’
and ‘
Put two or more words
together’
(language).
Statistical Analysis
Data were initially cleaned using scripts in SPSS (Ver. 22, IBM
Corp., 2013) to remove any impossible values due to entry errors,

Toddler Touchscreen Use and Developmental Milestones
To assess the association between age of first touchscreen use
and age of achieving developmental milestones, three separate
partial correlations were run for gross motor skills (walking),
fine motor skills (stacking blocks), and language (producing
two-word utterances) with age of touchscreen use, covarying
for the corresponding ‘
early’
milestone (pincer grip, sitting and
first word, respectively), mother’
s education (a proxy for social
economic status), age, and sex. Partial correlations were chosen
as the retrospectively reported time of first touchscreen use and
age of achieving milestones varied in the order of which occurred
first, so the direction of effect cannot be inferred.
RESULTS
How Does Touchscreen Use Change
From 6 To 36 Months?
In our sample, only two of the 715 respondents had no
touchscreen devices in their home, average ownership being 3.73
devices per household (SD = 1.50, range 0–
14). Among 6- to
36-month-old infants and toddlers, 9.62% of children (59/613)
had their own touchscreen. When split by age (quartiles 6–
11,
12–
18, 19–
25, and 26–
36 months) ownership increased from 0%
among infants aged 6–
11 months through to 21.19% for 26- to
36-month-olds (see Table 1).
Overall, ∼75% of our sample used a touchscreen, and analysis
of touchscreen use by age showed that the proportion of users
increased from 51.22% in 6–
11 month-olds through to 92.05% by
25–
36 months (see Figure 1A). However, within the children who
did not use a touchscreen daily (i.e., ∼25% of 6- to 36-month-
olds) only 42.11% (64/152) reported no prior use of a touchscreen
device at all. Within users, the average daily use between 6 and
36 months was 24.45 min (SD = 38.98, range: 0–
310 min), which
increased from 8.53 min per day at 6–
11 months to 43.95 min at
26–
36 months (see Figure 1B).
Retrospectively Reported Touchscreen
Use and Developmental Milestones
For all the following retrospectively reported data (i.e., age of first
touchscreen use and achieving developmental milestones), our
analyses include only toddlers 19 months and older (i.e., a median
split; N = 366). This is to ensure that the majority of children have
had the opportunity to achieve the developmental milestones and
use a touchscreen device (see Table 1). In these toddlers, mean
reported age of first touchscreen use was 13.13 months (SD: 6.05),
with no significant difference between age of first scrolling (mean:
15.11 months, SD: 6.06) and video watching (14.67, SD: 6.45):
t(225) = −1.17, p = 0.25.
For developmental milestones, a 2 (developmental level:
early, late) ∗ 3 (domain: gross motor, fine motor, language)
repeated measures ANOVA, showed a significant effect of
domain [F(2,414) = 246.15, p < 0.001, η2
p = 0.54], with
parents reporting earliest achievement for gross motor skills
(estimated mean age = 9.15 months), followed by fine motor
skills (estimated mean = 10.67 months) and then language
(estimated mean = 14.06 months). There was also a significant
effect of developmental level [F(1,207) = 1624.79, p < 0.001,
η2
p = 0.89], with the ‘
early’milestones (sitting, pincer grip,
and first word; estimated mean age = 8.38 months) achieved,
as expected, before the ‘
late’milestones (walking, stacking
blocks, and combining two words together; estimated mean
age = 14.21 months). The developmental level by domain
interaction was also significant [Greenhouse–
Geisser corrected:
F(1.81,374.92) = 22.39, p < 0.001, η2
p = 0.10], with less difference
between the age of achieving the ‘
late’
milestones compared to the
‘
early’
milestones.
How Does Touchscreen Usage Relate to
Developmental Milestones in Toddlers?
Analyzing data from toddlers between 19 and 36 months
of age, we tested whether age of first touchscreen use was

correlated with age of achieving key developmental milestones:
gross motor skills (walking), fine motor skills (stacking blocks),
and language (producing two-word utterances), covarying for
the corresponding ‘
early’milestone (pincer grip, sitting, and
first word, respectively), mother’
s education, age, and sex.
No significant associations between age of first touchscreen
use and either gross motor (walking: r = −0.08, p = 0.21)
or language (combining two words: r = −0.02, p = 0.83)
were found. However, age of first touchscreen usage was
significantly associated with the fine motor milestone stacking
blocks (r = 0.16, p = 0.03) (see Figure 2). To test whether type
of usage was important, we ran separate partial correlations for
age of first active scrolling of the screen and watching videos.
Age of first scrolling was significantly associated with stacking
(r = 0.16, p = 0.04), controlling for previous covariates (pincer
grip, mother’
s education, age, sex) and age of first watching
videos. However, the association with age of first watching
videos (controlling for scrolling) was not significant (r = 0.04,
p = 0.62).
DISCUSSION
These results confirm the prevalence and rapid increase of
touchscreen use over the first 3 years of life in a large UK-
wide online sample. Contrary to the guidelines adopted by
international parent-advisory agencies (Brown, 2011; Strasburger
and Hogan, 2013) including the UK government (Public Health
England, 2013), the majority (75.20%) of our 6- to 36-month-
old sample of children had daily exposure to touchscreen devices,
far exceeding the prescribed zero screen time for that age group.
This figure is higher than reported in earlier studies examining
touchscreen use up to 24 months of age (Rideout, 2013; Cristia
and Seidl, 2015) but similar to the exposure reported in a recent
sample from Northern Ireland (Ahearne et al., 2015) and to
a low SES American sample (Kabali et al., 2015). Even within
the 25% who did not report daily touchscreen use, only 42.1%
reported that their child had never used a touchscreen. These
results indicate that within our sample, touchscreen devices are
a common part of a toddler’
s media environment and everyday
sensory/cognitive stimulation.
The representativeness of our sample to the UK population is
not known, as the recruitment was not random and participants
may have volunteered due to a pre-existing interest in the
topic of media and child development. The proportion of high
SES families was also overrepresented in our sample with 86%
with degree level education or above. However, a recent UK
government survey confirms that the majority of families with
somewhat older children (3- to 4-year-olds) own at least one
tablet computer (65%) and use it regularly (39%; Ofcom, 2014).
Our higher touchscreen exposure percentage (75.20% versus
Ofcom’
s 39%) may be due to the fact that Ofcom does not include
touchscreen smartphones within results for tablets (smartphone
availability is measured separately; e.g., 41% of 5- to 15-year-
olds own a smartphone; Ofcom, 2014). This is supported by a
survey of 3- to 5-year-old children conducted by The National
Literacy Trust which reported 72.9% access to a touchscreen
device in the home including smartphones (Formby, 2014). Thus,
while it does not appear that our sample is made up of families
with uncharacteristically high media exposure, it is possible that
there are more subtle differences in the way in which devices are
being used by higher SES families. Future studies should attempt
to gather a randomly selected, representative sample, or target
families with low-media use to ensure representation of the full
range of media environments.
One objective of this study was to address popular fears that
early exposure to touchscreen devices may negatively impact
toddler development (Carr, 2010; Sigman, 2012; Greenfield,
2015). In order to gather data on early development in a
large online sample without the need for a long standardized
questionnaire (e.g., Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales) or
observational assessment (e.g., Mullen; Mullen, 1995), we chose
the age of achieving key developmental milestones: fine motor
(i.e., stacking blocks), gross motor (i.e., walking), language (i.e.,
saying two-word utterances). However, this approach yields only
single-item measures of developmental milestones. In reality of
course, abilities such as walking actually develop over a period
of time, from a first shaky step to confident locomotion. Future
studies should collect more detailed developmental measures
longitudinally, at the time they are emerging. An additional
limitation is the retrospective reporting of milestones, which are
subject to recall bias (Sudman and Bradburn, 1973), as well as the
fact that we do not know how reliable parents are in remembering
aspects of first touchscreen use. Our results did not show any
evidence for negative associations between touchscreen use and
developmental milestones, but there was a significant positive
association between the retrospectively reported age of achieving
the fine motor milestone and the age at which the child first used
a touchscreen. Specifically, this relationship was only present for
the child’
s age of first actively controlling the screen by scrolling
or touching, and not for watching videos.
The average age of reaching the fine motor milestone –
stacking three or more blocks –was 13.29 months (SD = 4.17),
which is consistent with the 12–
15 months age window expected

Toddler Touchscreen Use and Developmental Milestones
for the development of block stacking (Gerber et al., 2010).
The positive association suggests that infants who are actively
using a touchscreen earlier are also developing earlier fine
motor abilities observable with real objects. However, given that
both the milestone and the age of first use are retrospectively
reported and may occur in either order we cannot currently
interpret the direction of this effect. It may be that infants with
developmentally advanced fine motor skills are more likely to
actively scroll, touch and control a touchscreen device when
given the opportunity, in the same way that they will apply their
newfound skills to any object placed before them. Alternately,
exposure to a highly stimulating, rewarding and responsive
touchscreen device prior to the onset of their advanced fine motor
skills may encourage experimentation of finger and hand control
which ultimately transfers to real-world objects. In order to know
which of these hypothesized mechanisms is causing the effect,
future studies will need to chart both touchscreen use and motor
development longitudinally using more fine-grained and precise
measurement.
Evidence for a relationship between active screen-based media
use and fine motor skill has previously been reported in
older children and adults (for review, see Green and Bavelier,
2008). Touchscreen phone use is related to increased fingertip
somatosensation and associated brain activity in adults (Gindrat
et al., 2015), manual dexterity and visual motor skills can
be trained by videogames including specialist skills such as
laparoscopic surgery (Lynch et al., 2010) and piloting an aircraft
(Gopher et al., 1994). Transfer of the manual skill trained by
screen-based media to the real world is often dependent on
specificity of the trained virtual skill and its similarity with the
real skills (Green and Bavelier, 2008). For example, a study
assessing the relationship between general computer use and
development in 38- to 61-month-olds found no relationship
with visuomotor or gross motor development even though
advantages in school readiness and cognitive development
were found (Li and Atkins, 2004). To assess causality in
the direction of the relationship between active touchscreen
use and real world fine motor development, future studies
should utilize an intervention design in which specific manual
gestures/skills are encouraged in infants using a touchscreen early
in development.
In terms of the assessed gross motor (walking) and language
milestones (two word utterances) our analyses did not reveal
any relationship – positive or negative – with the age of first
using a touchscreen. The average reported age of walking onset
in our toddler sample (12.86 months, SD = 2.34) is consistent
with the expected mean walking onset (12 months; Onis, 2006;
Gerber et al., 2010) as is the age of first using two-word
utterances (our sample: 16.90 months, SD = 4.17; compared
to mean onset 17–
18 months: Fenson et al., 2000; Gerber
et al., 2010). Our results can neither confirm nor deny the
displacement hypothesis (Strasburger et al., 2012), which states
that the time a child spends engaged with a screen limits the
time they have to do other activities, leading to reduced physical
activity (Sisson et al., 2010; although see Taveras et al., 2007)
or face-to-face communication (Huttenlocher, 1998; Hart and
Risley, 2003; Rowe, 2012; Sosa, 2016). Although, we do not
have a measure of physical activity or social interaction in our
sample, we do not find any evidence that touchscreen usage
is displacing other forms of physical exploration that relate to
the onset of walking or the social and linguistic stimulation
that facilitates spoken language when other factors such as SES,
sex, and age are controlled for. This absence of displacement
may be, in part, because touchscreen devices are inherently
portable (thus facilitating mobility), can be used collaboratively
by multiple people (for an overview of pre-schooler/parent
tablet co-use see Marsh et al., 2015) and are increasingly being
used in parallel with other media such as TV (74% of 14- to
17-year-olds report using a smartphone whilst watching TV;
Accenture, 2015). In addition, it may be that early touchscreen
use impacts language and gross motor only later in development,
when these skills are more advanced (e.g., vocabulary size,
physical activity), rather than the early milestones assessed
here.
Our findings are the first attempt to identify the impact of
the recent introduction of touchscreen devices into the early
environment of toddlers on development. The results of the
current study provide no evidence of a negative association
between toddlers’
use of touchscreen devices and developmental
outcomes and even suggest a positive association with fine
motor development. However, our current analysis is limited
by the fact that we do not have a measure of how much each
child was using a touchscreen prior to reaching developmental
milestones. Our only measure of the amount of usage is reported
at the child’
s current age and we do not know how this
relates to earlier usage. To examine whether the association
between early touchscreen use and age of reaching developmental
milestones is “
dosage”dependent or varies with other usage
factors (such as co-use, physical context, or type of use), future
studies will need to use more reliable methods of tracking
current touchscreen use such as media diaries or objective
measures (e.g., device monitoring). Also, our present analysis
does not report other aspects of development that may also be
associated with early touchscreen use such as eyesight problems
(e.g., increased myopia in children who read intensely; Ip
et al., 2008), muscular and skeletal pain and problems due to
excessive use (e.g., phone use in adults; Berolo et al., 2011),
sleep problems (e.g., videogame use in children; Dworak et al.,
2007), emotion and conduct problems (e.g., childhood TV
predicting adult problems; Robertson et al., 2013), or cognitive
development such as attention control and executive function
(e.g., the immediate impact of fast-paced TV viewing; Lillard
and Peterson, 2011). More precise lab-based assessments of
these factors are required along with the detailed analysis of
touchscreen usage. Future intervention studies that can control
for pre-existing differences in these groups and help to address
questions of causality will also be important, although the ethical
issues of how to introduce a potentially negative influence
into a child’
s environment must be addressed first (Bavelier
et al., 2010). A more nuanced charting of the exact ways
in which children are using the touchscreen, as well as the
pedagogical and age-appropriateness of the apps (Hirsh-Pasek
et al., 2015), is required. Given the inherent flexibility of these
devices, not all use can be considered to have the same impact

Toddler Touchscreen Use and Developmental Milestones
on development (Christakis, 2014). This view is supported by the
differential association we find between the age of fine motor
milestone achievement and touchscreen scrolling versus video
watching.
Our results suggest that touchscreen use by toddlers is
prevalent in the UK and only likely to increase given the
increasing computational intelligence and adoption of touch
as a mode of interaction by almost all household appliances,
toys and even clothing (e.g., smartwatches and running
gear). The intuitive nature of touchscreens for pre-linguistic
children (Cristia and Seidl, 2015) means that the current
recommendations for zero screen time for children under 2 years
is out of line with the reality of the current home media
environment of most toddlers and difficult to enforce by parents
who themselves are conducting more of their lives through such
devices. Parents may also be considering touchscreen devices
as exempt from the “
no screens”guidelines, as has previously
been reported for infant and toddler use of videochat (McClure
et al., 2015). Our evidence that children who scroll touchscreen
devices earlier may develop fine motor control earlier is the
first indication of how our current generation are adapting to
their new media environment and setting the foundation for
a life spent interacting with such devices. How such exposure
relates to long-term development, educational achievement and
impacts future society are pressing research questions facing
developmental science.
