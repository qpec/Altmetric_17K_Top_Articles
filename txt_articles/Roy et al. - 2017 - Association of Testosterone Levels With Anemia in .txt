Abstract
Importance—In one-third of older men with anemia, no recognized cause can be found.
Objective—To determine if testosterone treatment of men 65 years or older with unequivocally 
low testosterone levels and unexplained anemia would increase their hemoglobin concentration.
Design, Setting, and Participants—A double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with treatment 
allocation by minimization using 788 men 65 years or older who have average testosterone levels 
of less than 275 ng/dL. Of 788 participants, 126 were anemic (hemoglobin Š12.7 g/dL), 62 of 
whom had no known cause. The trial was conducted in 12 academic medical centers in the United 
States from June 2010 to June 2014.

 Interventions—Testosterone gel, the dose adjusted to maintain the testosterone levels normal for 
young men, or placebo gel for 12 months.
Main Outcomes and Measures—The percent of men with unexplained anemia whose 
hemoglobin levels increased by 1.0 g/dL or more in response to testosterone compared with 
placebo. The statistical analysis was intent-to-treat by a logistic mixed effects model adjusted for 
balancing factors.
Results—The men had a mean age of 74.8 years and body mass index (BMI) (calculated as 
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 30.7; 84.9% were white. Testosterone 
treatment resulted in a greater percentage of men with unexplained anemia whose month 12 
hemoglobin levels had increased by 1.0 g/dL or more over baseline (54%) than did placebo (15%) 
(adjusted OR, 31.5; 95% CI, 3.7-277.8; P = .002) and a greater percentage of men who at month 
12 were no longer anemic (58.3%) compared with placebo (22.2%) (adjusted OR, 17.0; 95% CI, 
2.8-104.0; P = .002). Testosterone treatment also resulted in a greater percentage of men with 
anemia of known cause whose month 12 hemoglobin levels had increased by 1.0 g/dL or more 
(52%) than did placebo (19%) (adjusted OR, 8.2; 95% CI, 2.1-31.9; P = .003). Testosterone 
treatment resulted in a hemoglobin concentration of more than 17.5 g/dL in 6 men who had not 
been anemic at baseline.
Conclusions and Relevance—Among older men with low testosterone levels, testosterone 
treatment significantly increased the hemoglobin levels of those with unexplained anemia as well 
as those with anemia from known causes. These increases may be of clinical value, as suggested 
by the magnitude of the changes and the correction of anemia in most men, but the overall health 
benefits remain to be established. Measurement of testosterone levels might be considered in men 
65 years or older who have unexplained anemia and symptoms of low testosterone levels.
The prevalence of anemia is approximately 10 percent in older adults1-3 and tends to be 
higher in men than in women.2,4,5 Several causes of anemia in the elderly are recognized, 
including iron and vitamin B12 deficiencies, chronic inflammation and disease, chronic 
renal insufficiency, and the myelodysplastic syndromes. In approximately one-third of older 
adults with anemia, however, no recognized cause can be found.1,6-10 No treatment has been 
shown to improve this unexplained anemia.
One possible cause of unexplained anemia in older men is testosterone deficiency, because 
serum testosterone levels decline as men age,11-13 and testosterone treatment of men with 
very low testosterone increases their hemoglobin levels.14 In 2 population studies, low 
testosterone levels were significantly associated with unexplained anemia.7,15 Although 
testosterone treatment of older men with low testosterone levels has been shown to increase 
their hemoglobin concentrations,16-18 few studies have specifically addressed the effect of 
testosterone in anemic men, and none has examined the effect of testosterone on men with 
unexplained anemia. The main goal of this study—The Anemia Trial of the Testosterone 
Trials—was to test the hypothesis that testosterone treatment of men aged 65 years or older 
with unequivocally low testosterone levels and unexplained anemia would increase their 
hemoglobin concentrations more than placebo.19

 Methods
Study Design
The Testosterone Trials are 7 coordinated trials of the efficacy of testosterone in older men 
who have low testosterone concentrations. They were conducted at 12 clinical trial sites in 
the United States.19 Participants were allocated to receive testosterone or placebo gel for 1 
year, and efficacy was assessed every 3 months. This report describes the results of the 
Anemia Trial.
The protocol (Supplement 1) was approved by the institutional review boards of all 
participating institutions. All men gave written, informed consent to be included if they had 
low hemoglobin levels. A data safety monitoring board reviewed data unblinded every 3 
months.
Participants
The main Testosterone Trials inclusion criteria were men ages 65 years or older, 2 serum 
testosterone level test results that averaged less than 275 ng/dL, and low risk of prostate 
cancer.19,20 Potential participants were excluded if their hemoglobin levels were less than 
10.0 g/dL (to convert to g/L multiply by 10.0). Men whose baseline hemoglobin levels were 
12.7 g/dL or lower were included in the Anemia Trial. This value identifies anemia with 
greater precision than WHO criteria.21 Further testing subclassified anemia into unexplained 
anemia and anemia of known cause. The primary analysis was performed in men with 
unexplained anemia, but analyses were also performed in men with anemia of known cause 
and nonanemic men.
Classification of men as anemic and of the type of anemia was made on blood drawn at 
baseline but not analyzed until the end of the trial. Classification of anemia of inflammation 
was adjudicated by case reviews by a panel of 3 hematologists blinded to outcome. Anemic 
participants were classified as having a known cause if they had a serum creatinine level of 
2.2 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L multiply by 76.25) or higher (renal insufficiency); either a 
mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 105 fL or more and platelet count of 120 000/ mcL (to 
convert to ×109/L multiply by 1) or less or an MCV of 105 fL or more and an absolute 
neutrophil count less than 1200/ mcL (myelodysplasia); a ferritin level less than 40 ng/mL 
(iron deficiency) (to convert to pmol/L multiply by 2.247); folate levels less than 3.4 ng/mL 
(folate deficiency) (to convert to nmol/L multiply by 2.266); vitamin B12 less than 200 
pg/mL (B12 deficiency) (to convert to pmol/L multiply by 0.7378); ferritin levels higher than 
500 ng/mL and transferrin saturation less than 50% or ferritin levels higher than 40 ng/mL 
and a history of a medical condition or medication indicating chronic disease or 
inflammation (anemia of inflammation); haptoglobin levels less than 14 mg/dL (to convert 
to mg/L multiply by 10) and MCV greater than 100 fL (hemolytic anemia); and IgG, IgA or 
IgM levels higher than 1.0 g/dL (plasma cell dyscrasia and/or monoclonal gammopathy). 
Anemic participants who met none of these criteria were classified as having unexplained 
anemia.
Men were not treated for anemia as part of the trial, although some took iron outside of the 
trial, as follows: At baseline, unexplained anemia, 7 (testosterone/placebo 3/4); known

 cause, 8 (testosterone/placebo 3/5). At month 12, unexplained anemia, 6 (testosterone/
placebo 4/2); known cause, 8 (testosterone/placebo 5/3).
Testosterone Treatment
We allocated participants to treatment by minimization, which allows balancing with a larger 
number of variables than stratified randomization. Participants were assigned to the 
optimally balancing treatment with 80% probability.20 Balancing variables included age 
under or over 75 years and screening testosterone levels under or over 200 ng/dL.20
Testosterone was administered as a 1% gel in a pump bottle (AndroGel; AbbVie). Placebo 
gel was similar. The dose was initially 5 g per day and was adjusted to attempt to keep the 
concentration at levels that are normal for young men. The adjustment was made by a staff 
member in the data coordinating center based on a prespecified algorithm. Measurements 
were made at a central laboratory (Quest Clinical Trials) at months 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9. To 
maintain blinding when the dose was adjusted in a man taking testosterone gel, the dose was 
changed simultaneously in a man taking placebo gel. No participant or site staff member 
was aware of the treatment assignment.
Assessments
Whole blood was drawn at baseline and at months 3, 6, 9, and 12 for measurement of 
hemoglobin levels at a central laboratory (Quest Clinical Trials). Red blood cell indices were 
determined on whole blood, and creatinine levels and total protein were measured on sera 
from baseline. At the end of the trial, the serum concentrations of ferritin, transferrin 
saturation, folate, B12, and haptoglobin were measured in baseline sera that had been stored 
at −80°C. Protein electrophoresis was performed when the total protein was more than 7.9 
g/dL.
All participants in the Testosterone Trials were assessed for walking ability by the 6-minute 
Walk Test and for vitality by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy 
(FACIT)-Fatigue Scale at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.19 Patient Global Impression of Change 
(PGIC) questions about overall health, walking, sexual desire, energy, and memory were 
also asked every 3 months.19
Serum concentrations of testosterone, free testosterone, and estradiol were measured in sera 
from blood drawn at baseline and months 3, 6, 9, and 12 and stored at −80°C. These assays 
were performed at the Brigham Research Assay Core.22
Statistical Analyses
Participants were analyzed in the treatment group to which they were allocated, according to 
the intent-to-treat principle. The primary and secondary endpoints of dichotomous and 
continuous change in hemoglobin in the men with unexplained anemia were prespecified. A 
change of 1.0 g/dL or more for the dichotomous outcomes was selected, because this 
increase in hemoglobin concentration has previously been used to distinguish responders 
and nonresponders23,24 and has been associated with perceived improvement in quality of 
life.25 Additional prespecified exploratory analyses included assessment of the effect of

 assignment to testosterone vs placebo treatment on hemoglobin levels in men with anemia of 
known cause and nonanemic men. Exploratory outcomes that were not prespecified were the 
association of changes in hemoglobin with other outcomes. Data were analyzed by 
generalized linear mixed models for longitudinal data for both assigned treatment and 
change in hemoglobin at each month, with logistic and linear models for dichotomous and 
continuous outcomes, respectively. Treatment effect heterogeneity across anemic groups was 
evaluated by the interaction of treatment with anemia classification. The PGIC results were 
analyzed as ordinal variables by mixed effects proportional odds models. All models 
included a random intercept for participant. Treatment arm, visit month, baseline 
hemoglobin levels, and balancing factors were fixed effects. For dichotomous outcomes, the 
treatment effect is represented by the odds ratio (OR) of the probability of a positive vs a 
negative response for participants who were assigned to testosterone vs placebo treatment, 
averaged over all months. For continuous outcomes the treatment effect is the model-based 
difference in the change from baseline for participants assigned to testosterone vs placebo, 
averaged over all months. For the association of change in hemoglobin with vitality and 
walking, models provide an estimate of the mean change in the outcome for a 1.0 g/dL 
increase in hemoglobin averaged over all months. These outcomes were continuous. All 
analyses were conducted at a 2-sided significance level of .05. No adjustments were made 
for multiple comparisons.
Sensitivity of the primary analysis to missing data was assessed by a worst-case-scenario 
analysis in which the model was rerun after all missing outcomes among placebo-treated 
subjects were set to 1, indicating an increase in hemoglobin levels of 1g/dL or more, and all 
missing outcomes among testosterone-treated subjects were set to 0, indicating a change in 
hemoglobin levels of less than 1g/dL.
Cumulative distribution functions of the average change in hemoglobin levels by treatment 
arm assessed the impact of testosterone on changes in hemoglobin levels other than 1.0 
g/dL. Significance was assessed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
Sample size for the primary outcome, unexplained anemia, was not prespecified but was 
defined by the number of men in the Testosterone Trials who had a hemoglobin 
concentration of 12.7 g/dL or less and for whom no cause could be found. At the achieved 
minimum sample size of 27 patients per arm, there was 80% power to detect a difference in 
the percentage of men achieving a change in hemoglobin levels of at least 1g/dL if the true 
OR were 6.0 comparing testosteronetreated men with placebo-treated men, assuming the 
observed response rate of 10% among placebo-treated men, and conservatively assuming 
anintraclass correlation of ρ = 1 among repeated measurements in a participant. This 
corresponds to a response rate of 40% among testosterone-treated men.

 anemia of known cause: 8 (6.3%) owing to myelodysplasia, 42 (33.3%) iron deficiency, 3 
B12 deficiency (2.4%), 10 chronic inflammation or disease (7.9%), and 1 plasma cell 
dyscrasia. The remaining 62 (49.2%) had unexplained anemia. Treatment assignment by 
category of anemia or not anemic is shown in Figure 1.
The characteristics at baseline of the participants are shown by treatment arm in Table 1. 
Race was somewhat imbalanced, but the few African Americans do not allow conclusions 
about race. Sex hormone binding globulin levels were imbalanced among nonanemic men, 
but these differences are not likely important.
Overall retention was 90.5%, similar in both treatment arms (Figure 1). The median serum 
testosterone concentration was below normal for young men prior to treatment and increased 
to mid-normal in both categories of anemic men and in the nonanemic men at 3, 6, 9, and 12 
months of testosterone treatment (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). Testosterone concentrations 
in the placebo-treated men were lower than normal prior to treatment and did not change 
appreciably during treatment.
Effect of Testosterone Treatment on Hemoglobin Concentration
Testosterone treatment increased the percentage of men whose hemoglobin concentration 
improved by 1.0 g/dL or more over the baseline value more than placebo treatment in men 
with unexplained anemia (AOR, 31.5; 95% CI, 3.7-277.8; P = .002) (Figure 2) (Table 2) 
(eFigure 2 in Supplement 2) (primary outcome). At month 12, 54% of testosterone-treated 
men but only 15% of placebo-treated men had experienced increases of 1.0 g/dL or more 
above baseline (AOR, 31.5; 95% CI, 3.7-277.8) (Table 2). A similar effect occurred in men 
with known causes of anemia (AOR, 8.2; 95% CI, 2.1-31.9; P = .003), and in nonanemic 
men (OR, 20.7; 95% CI, 12.9-33.3; P < .001);. the OR for an increase of 1.0 g/dL or more 
for testosterone-vs placebo-treated men did not differ by baseline anemia classification (P = .
09). The worst-case-scenario sensitivity analysis for missing data suggested a nearly 
significant greater percent of men in the testosterone arm whose hemoglobin increased by 
1.0 g/dL or more (OR, 5.0; 95% CI, 0.83-29.4; P = .07).
Testosterone also increased hemoglobin concentrations by continuous analysis in men with 
unexplained anemia (secondary outcome) (adjusted mean difference [AMD], 0.83 g/dL; 
95% CI, 0.48-1.39; P < .001) (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2), men with known causes of 
anemia (AMD, 0.64 g/dL; 95% CI, 0.12-1.17; P = .02), and nonanemic men (AMD, 0.90 
g/dL; 95% CI, 0.78-1.03; P < .001). The effect of testosterone on continuous change in 
hemoglobin levels did not differ by anemia classification (P = .43).
At month 12, 12 of 24 (58.3%) testosterone-treated men with unexplained anemia at 
baseline were no longer anemic, compared with 6 of 24 (22.2%) placebo-treated men (OR, 
17.0; 95% CI, 2.8-104.0; P = .002). In 25 men with anemia of known cause at baseline and 
treated with testosterone, 15 (60%) were no longer anemic at month 12, compared with 4 of 
27 (14.8%) men treated with placebo (OR, 9.4; 95% CI, 1.4-60.5; P = .02).

 Placebo-treated men had lower average hemoglobin level changes than testosterone-treated 
men, as shown by comparison of the cumulative distribution functions (eFigure 3 in 
Supplement 2).
Increases in Hemoglobin Levels Related to Other Outcomes
The increase in hemoglobin in response to testosterone in all anemic men, an exploratory 
outcome, was positively and significantly associated with very small increases in 6-minute 
walking distance and vitality, as assessed by the FACIT-Fatigue Scale. An increase in 
hemoglobin levels of 1.0 g/dL was associated with an increase of 8.3 meters in 6-minute 
walking distance (P < .001) and a 1.0 point improvement in the FACIT-Fatigue Scale (P < .
02) in all anemic men (eFigure 4 in Supplement 2).
The increase in hemoglobin levels was also positively associated with Patient Global 
Impression of Change in all 5 areas tested, but the association reached statistical significance 
only for general health (AOR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.5; P = .001) and energy (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 
1.2-3.0; P = .008), but not for walking ability (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.8-1.7; P = .33), sexual 
desire (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.9-2.8; P = .13), or memory (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.9-1.8; P = .17) 
(Figure 3).
Adverse Events
Six of the 336 men who were not anemic at baseline and were treated with testosterone 
developed hemoglobin values of 17.5 g/dL or higher during treatment (eTable in Supplement 
2). Four of the 6 had serum testosterone concentrations higher than 800 ng/dL when 
erythrocytosis was detected. In all Testosterone Trials participants, there were no significant 
differences between treatment arms in major adverse cardiovascular events, serious adverse 
events, or prostate cancer.22
Discussion
Testosterone treatment of these men who also had unexplained anemia significantly 
increased the percentage of those whose hemoglobin concentration improved by 1.0 g/dL or 
more above baseline compared with placebo treatment. Among men with unexplained 
anemia, 58.3% of those treated with testosterone were no longer anemic at month 12, 
compared with 22.2% treated with placebo. Testosterone treatment also resulted in similar 
improvements in men who were anemic for a known cause and in men who were not 
anemic. Testosterone treatment of men ages 65 years or older who had a mean testosterone 
level of less than 275 ng/dL resulted in improvement in all aspects of sexual function and 
some benefit in mood and depressive symptoms but no benefit in vitality.22 In all anemic 
men combined, there were small but statistically significant positive associations between 
the increases in hemoglobin levels and improvement in walking and vitality. Increases in 
hemoglobin levels were positively and significantly associated with participants' global 
impression of change in overall health and energy.
The overall incidence of any anemia in all men enrolled in the Testosterone Trials was 
16.0%, which is higher than the approximately 10% to 15% reported in some surveys of 
anemia in older men1,26,27 but lower than the approximately 24% reported in another,28

 perhaps representing differences in demographics or illnesses among the different 
populations. Among the anemic men in the Testosterone Trials, the incidence of unexplained 
anemia was 49.2%, similar to that in 2 other studies. In a study of 69 anemic men, 53.6% 
had unexplained anemia.9 In a study of 190 anemic patients, of whom 85% were men, 35% 
had unexplained anemia.10
Although the effect of testosterone on older men with unexplained anemia has not been 
reported previously, the stimulatory effect of testosterone on hemoglobin levels in men with 
low testosterone is well established. Testosterone has been shown to increase hemoglobin 
levels in men with low-normal testosterone owing to no discernable reason other than age29 
and in men with markedly low testosterone owing to pituitary or testicular disease.14 This 
effect of testosterone is dose-dependent, more so in older than in younger men.30 In 33 older 
men with low testosterone and anemia, testosterone treatment corrected the anemia in 21.31
The finding that testosterone treatment of men 65 years or older with low testosterone 
increased hemoglobin concentration whether they were anemic or not confirms that 
testosterone stimulates erythropoiesis in hypogonadal men. The improvement in hemoglobin 
levels by physiologic replacement of testosterone in men who had known causes of anemia 
suggests that their anemia was owing to low testosterone as well as to the known cause, such 
as iron deficiency.
The finding that testosterone treatment of men 65 years or older with low testosterone and 
unexplained anemia increased hemoglobin concentration by more than 1.0 g/dL is 
important; previously no treatment has been reported to improve unexplained anemia in 
older men. These results are also important because they suggest that evaluation of 
unexplained anemia in older men with symptoms consistent with hypogonadism might 
include measurement of serum testosterone. However, the percentage of older men with 
unexplained anemia who have low testosterone compared with the percentage in all older 
men is not known.
Although the increase in hemoglobin levels was significantly associated with improvements 
in walking distance and vitality, the degrees of improvement were modest. An increase in 
hemoglobin of 1.0 g/dL was associated with an increase in walking distance of 8.3 meters, 
whereas an increase of 50 meters has been shown to be the minimum distance at which an 
individual can detect improvement in walking.32 An increase in hemoglobin levels of 1.0 
g/dL was associated with an improvement of 1 point in the FACIT-Fatigue Scale of vitality, 
whereas a 3 to 4 point increase would be needed to convey clinical meaningfulness.33 
Nonetheless, greater increases in hemoglobin levels were significantly associated with the 
participants' global impression of change in overall health and energy, suggesting that the 
increase in hemoglobin levels was clinically significant.
Testosterone treatment resulted in erythrocytosis only in nonanemic men, and only in 6 (2%) 
of 336 participants, mostly when the serum testosterone was elevated. This finding supports 
the recommendation to monitor hemoglobin levels during testosterone treatment.34

 Limitations
The Anemia Trial had several strengths, including a placebo-controlled, double-blind design, 
enrollment of men who had unequivocally low testosterone and hemoglobin levels by 
stringent criteria, and excellent participant retention. A major limitation of this trial, 
although by design, is that the results apply only to men 65 years or older who have low 
testosterone concentrations. They do not apply to men with unexplained anemia but normal 
testosterone concentrations. Another limitation is the small sample size for each anemia 
subgroup, resulting in wide confidence intervals for the estimated treatment effects. Lack of 
a prespecified adjustment for multiple comparisons resulted in an inflated probability of a 
false-positive result, but posthoc review suggested that the strongly significant findings for 
changes in hemoglobin levels across anemic subgroups still holds after Holm-Bonferroni 
adjustment.35
Conclusions
Among older men with low testosterone, testosterone treatment significantly increased 
hemoglobin levels in those with unexplained anemia and those with anemia associated with 
known causes. These increases may be of clinical significance, as suggested by the 
magnitude of the increases and the correction of anemia in the majority of men. The overall 
health benefits, however, remain to be determined. These results also suggest that 
measurement of serum testosterone levels might be considered in men 65 years or older who 
have unexplained anemia and symptoms of hypogonadism.

 Key Points
Question Will testosterone treatment of older men with low testosterone levels and mild 
anemia improve their anemia?
Findings Testosterone treatment of older men with low testosterone levels and 
unexplained anemia corrected the anemia more than placebo. This treatment also 
corrected anemia more than placebo in men who had anemia of known causes, such as 
iron deficiency.
Meaning Testosterone deficiency in older men results in decreased hemoglobin levels 
and sometimes in mild anemia. Correcting the testosterone deficiency is associated with 
increased hemoglobin levels and tends to correct the anemia, even in the presence of a 
coexisting cause of anemia.

Participants were asked at each 3-month visit if their overall health, walking, sexual desire, 
energy and memory were much better, a little better, not changed, a little worse, or a lot 
worse than at the beginning of the trial. For analysis, the much worse and little worse 
categories were combined. Boxes represent the interquartile ranges (IQR), and the whiskers 
represent 1.5× the IQR for the change in hemoglobin levels pooled across months. P values 
were calculated by a mixed effects proportional odds model with 4-level PGIC response as

aValues are means (SDs) for continuous outcomes and No. (%) for dichotomous outcomes.
bThe treatment effect for continuous outcomes is the mean difference in change from baseline for participants allocated to testosterone vs placebo, adjusted for balancing factors: baseline total testosterone 
(≤200ng/dL), age (≤75 years), site, participation in the main trials, use of antidepressants, and use of PDE-5 inhibitors. The treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes is the odds ratio for achieving an 
increase of 1.0 g/dL or more for participants allocated to testosterone vs placebo, adjusted for the same balancing factors.
cThe effect size is the treatment effect divided by the baseline standard deviation.
dThe P value for the significance of the treatment effect was determined by a linear mixed model for continuous outcomes and logistic mixed model for dichotomous outcomes with a random intercept for 
participant.
eDichotomous hemoglobin response is an increase of 1 g/dL or more from baseline.
