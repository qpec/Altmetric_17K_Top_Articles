Abstract
BACKGROUND—Diagnoses of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in youths present a substantial 
clinical and public health burden. The prevalence of these diseases increased in the 2001–2009 
period, but data on recent incidence trends are lacking.
METHODS—We ascertained cases of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus at five study centers in 
the United States. Denominators (4.9 million youths annually) were obtained from the U.S. 
Census or health-plan member counts. After the calculation of annual incidence rates for the 
2002–2012 period, we analyzed trends using generalized autoregressive moving-average models 
with 2-year moving averages.
RESULTS—A total of 11,245 youths with type 1 diabetes (0 to 19 years of age) and 2846 with 
type 2 diabetes (10 to 19 years of age) were identified. Overall unadjusted estimated incidence 
rates of type 1 diabetes increased by 1.4% annually (from 19.5 cases per 100,000 youths per year

 in 2002–2003 to 21.7 cases per 100,000 youths per year in 2011–2012, P = 0.03). In adjusted 
pairwise comparisons, the annual rate of increase was greater among Hispanics than among non-
Hispanic whites (4.2% vs. 1.2%, P<0.001). Overall unadjusted incidence rates of type 2 diabetes 
increased by 7.1% annually (from 9.0 cases per 100,000 youths per year in 2002–2003 to 12.5 
cases per 100,000 youths per year in 2011–2012, P<0.001 for trend across race or ethnic group, 
sex, and age subgroups). Adjusted pairwise comparisons showed that the relative annual increase 
in the incidence of type 2 diabetes among non-Hispanic whites (0.6%) was lower than that among 
non-Hispanic blacks, Asians or Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans (P<0.05 for all 
comparisons) and that the annual rate of increase among Hispanics differed significantly from that 
among Native Americans (3.1% vs. 8.9%, P = 0.01). After adjustment for age, sex, and race or 
ethnic group, the relative annual increase in the incidence of type 1 diabetes was 1.8% (P<0.001) 
and that of type 2 diabetes was 4.8% (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS—The incidences of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes among youths increased 
significantly in the 2002–2012 period, particularly among youths of minority racial and ethnic 
groups. (Funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)
Diagnoses of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in youths present a substantial clinical and public 
health burden owing to the challenges of disease management and the risks of acute and 
chronic complications.1 The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study (hereafter, the SEARCH 
study) previously showed increases in the prevalences of both diseases in the 2001–2009 
period.2 However, data on the trends in incidence are needed to understand the current and 
potential burden of diabetes more fully.
Previous reports have shown that the incidence of type 1 diabetes has increased worldwide 
over the past three decades.3–8 Data from Australia showed a 5-year sinusoidal cyclical 
pattern from 2000 through 2011 in the incidence of type 1 diabetes among youths.9 
However, a report from Finland suggested a stabilization of the incidence of type 1 diabetes 
in the 2005–2011 period,10 which was similar to trends in Norway.11 Although several U.S. 
registries have shown increases in the incidence of type 1 diabetes,12–15 such studies have 
been limited geographically or did not encompass diverse racial and ethnic groups.16
The SEARCH study previously showed the incidence of type 2 diabetes among children,17 
and we are aware of one longitudinal study of incidence trends of type 2 diabetes among 
youths.18 Here, we report estimated trends in the incidences of type 1 and type 2 diabetes 
among youths from the five major racial and ethnic groups in the United States.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND DATA COLLECTION
We analyzed data from the SEARCH study, a multicenter observational study that since 
2002 has conducted population-based case ascertainment among youths who have received a 
diagnosis of nongestational diabetes before the age of 20 years.1,19 Youths were identified at 
five clinical centers — in California (all youths who were Kaiser Permanente Southern 
California health-plan enrollees in 7 counties), in Colorado (youths from all 64 counties, 
plus selected Native American reservations in Arizona and New Mexico), in Ohio (youths

 from 8 counties), in South Carolina (youths from all 46 counties), and in Washington 
(youths from 5 counties). All the surveillance networks included participating 
endocrinologists. Additional cases were identified by other health care providers, hospitals, 
community health centers, clinical and administrative data systems, and diabetes registries.
Case reports were validated on the basis of a physician’s diagnosis of diabetes in the medical 
record. Eligibility was based on age (<20 years), nonmilitary status, noninstitutionalized 
status, and county or area of residence for the centers in Colorado, Ohio, South Carolina, 
and Washington or health-plan membership (Kaiser Permanente Southern California 
enrollees or, for the Native American reservations coordinated by the Colorado center, 
Indian Health Service beneficiaries) at the time of diagnosis. After case validation and the 
deletion of duplicate cases, case patients were registered centrally. Diabetes type was noted 
as the physician-assigned diabetes type within 6 months after diagnosis. The case-
ascertainment window was defined as 30 months after December 31 of each year in which 
the diagnosis was made (the incident year).
All registered case patients were invited to complete a survey that included questions about 
race and ethnic group that aligned with the U.S. Census questions. For the incident years of 
2002 through 2006 and 2008 and 2012, all youths with diabetes other than diabetes that was 
due to a secondary cause were invited to a research visit. Written informed consent and 
assent, when appropriate, were obtained from all the participants or from parents or legal 
guardians for participants who were too young to provide written consent.19 Blood samples 
were analyzed for three diabetes autoantibodies — glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 
(GAD65)20; insulinoma-associated 2 molecule (IA-2), with the use of a standardized 
protocol20; and zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8), with the use of a radioassay.21
The study steering committee led and approved the study design, and data were collected 
under standardized protocols that were approved by the institutional review board at each 
center, including case ascertainment and registration performed under a Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) waiver of written informed consent. The 
coordinating center was responsible for data quality control and analysis. All the 
investigators vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data. Drafts of the manuscript 
were written by the first author, with all the authors providing review and input. The study 
publications committee and steering committee approved the manuscript before it was 
submitted for publication, as did the funding agencies, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 
National Institutes of Health.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Patients with type 1 diabetes (including physiciandefined types 1, 1a, and 1b) who were 
younger than 20 years of age on December 31 of the incident year were included. For type 2 
diabetes, we report the incidence rates among youths who were 10 to 19 years of age at 
diagnosis, because there were too few case patients who were younger than 10 years of age 
at diagnosis to produce stable rates (137 cases in the 2002–2012 period). Persons with all 
other types of diabetes, including secondary forms (e.g., diabetes due to cystic fibrosis or 
glucocorticoid-induced diabetes) were excluded (681 persons in the 2002–2012 period).

 Race and ethnic group were based on self-report when available from the participant survey 
(11,480 participants [81%]), from medical records (2217 [16%]), or from geocoding (i.e., 
assignment of a 2010 Census data–derived racial and ethnic-group proportion) for youths 
with missing data (394 [3%]).
The annual denominators included youths who were younger than 20 years of age on 
December 31 of the incident year and who were civilian residents of the geographic study 
areas, members of Kaiser Permanente Southern California for the included seven counties in 
California, or Indian Health Service beneficiaries at participating Native American 
reservations. For the geographically based centers, denominators used the bridged-race 
intercensal population estimates.22 For Kaiser Permanente Southern California, addresses 
were geocoded to the Census block level, and race and ethnic-group–specific proportions 
were applied to estimate the racial and ethnic-group composition of youths according to age 
and sex. For Native American reservations, the Indian Health Service user population for the 
previous 3 years was used in accordance with Indian Health Service definitions. 
Denominator estimates were then summed across all five centers. The distribution of 
demographic characteristics of the persons included in the denominators used in the current 
trial has been shown to be very similar to that of the general population in the United States 
over time.2
The annual incidence rates according to physician-assigned diabetes type were calculated as 
the number of the valid, registered patients (with duplicate cases deleted), regardless of 
subsequent participation in study surveys or visits, divided by the number of persons in the 
surveillance networks over the same period across the five centers. These rates are presented 
as 2-year moving averages and expressed per 100,000 youths, overall, and according to age 
group, sex, race or ethnic group, and study center. The 95% confidence intervals for the 
annual unadjusted rates were calculated with the use of the skew-corrected inverted-score 
test, assuming a binomial distribution.23 Adjustments for age, sex, race or ethnic group, and 
estimation of the annual rate of change were performed in a modeling framework.
Trends in incidence were tested with the use of a generalized autoregressive moving average 
(GARMA) to account for serial correlation.24 Likelihood-ratio tests were performed to 
compare three possible formulations: a first-order autoregressive and first-order moving-
average model (GARMA [1, 1]), a first-order autoregressive model (GARMA [1, 0]), and a 
first-order moving-average model (GARMA [0, 1]). Model selection suggested that the first-
order moving-average model (GARMA [0, 1]) provided the best fit for the majority of 
models. Trends that were adjusted for age, sex, and race or ethnic group and unadjusted 
trends in incidence were estimated with the use of a negative binomial distribution with 
logarithm link.
The model treated the observed number of diagnosed cases in each year as the outcome and 
the corresponding denominator as an offset. The stratification variable was removed from 
the list of covariates in each case to avoid multicollinearity. We performed homogeneity-of-
effect tests to compare the observed trends in incidence across strata. The GARMA model 
did not reach convergence in a few cases in which the cell counts were particularly low.

 Negative binomial regressions were fitted in these cases. Likelihood-ratio tests for quadratic 
and cubic trends were also considered.
We assessed the completeness of case ascertainment for the four geographically based 
centers using the capture–recapture method25 in a two-mode ascertainment model. A total of 
3068 of the 9782 cases (31%) were from hospital sources only, 270 (3%) were from other 
sources, and 6444 (66%) were reported by both hospital and other sources. The 
membership-based center did not have the independent data sources required for this 
method.
To ensure that trend analyses would not be affected by secular trends in the assignment of 
diabetes type by physicians, we compared the percentage of youth who had received a 
diagnosis from a provider of type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes with the percentage with type 
1 or type 2 diabetes according to our assessment of etiologic type, using the chi-square test 
and Cochran–Armitage test for trend. Our assessment of etiologic type was based on 
diabetes autoantibody positivity and insulin resistance,26 as measured in a subgroup of cases 
that were diagnosed in 2004, 2008, and 2012 for which the participant had a research visit 
(including 917, 1101, and 1077 participants, respectively, with type 1 diabetes, and 202, 256, 
and 316, respectively, with type 2 diabetes). To estimate the number of youth in the United 
States with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, the incidence rates from the SEARCH study were 
applied to the total U.S. population for the five racial and ethnic groups for the years of 
interest.
RESULTS
STUDY POPULATION
For the incident years in the 2002–2012 period, a total of 11,245 youths with type 1 diabetes 
(0 to 19 years of age) were identified from a denominator of 54,239,600 person-years (an 
average of approximately 4.9 million youths per year in the surveillance networks), and 
2846 youths with type 2 diabetes (10 to 19 years of age) were identified from a denominator 
of 28,029,000 person-years (approximately 2.5 million youths per year in the surveillance 
networks). Numerators that were based on 2-year moving averages for type 1 diabetes and 
type 2 diabetes are shown in Table 1. Case numbers according to age, sex, race or ethnic 
group, and study site are provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Denominator data according to age, sex, and 
race or ethnic group are provided in Tables S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Capture–recapture analyses revealed consistent estimated completeness of case 
ascertainment over three time periods (2002–2005, 2006–2008, and 2009–2012) for type 1 
diabetes (range, 98.5 to 98.8% complete) and for type 2 diabetes (range, 91.6 to 94.0% 
complete). The percentage of patients whose physician-diagnosed type 1 diabetes met our 
etiologic criteria for type 1 diabetes did not differ significantly over time (range, 95.8 to 
96.9%; P = 0.60). Similarly, the percentage of patients with physician-diagnosed type 2 
diabetes who met our etiologic criteria for type 2 diabetes did not differ significantly over 
time (range, 84.4 to 89.7%; P = 0.30).

 INCIDENCE TRENDS OF TYPE 1 DIABETES
From unadjusted models, a significant upward trend in the incidence of type 1 diabetes was 
observed overall (from 19.5 cases per 100,000 youths per year in 2002–2003 to 21.7 cases 
per 100,000 youths per year in 2011–2012; annual increase, 1.4%; P = 0.03), with 
considerable variation across demographic subgroups of age, sex, and race or ethnic group 
(Table 2). The incidence decreased in the subgroup of participants who were 0 to 4 years of 
age (P = 0.03) and increased in the subgroups of participants who were 5 to 9 years of age (P 
= 0.048) and those who were 15 to 19 years of age (P = 0.03). There was no significant 
change in the subgroup of participants who were 10 to 14 years of age (P = 0.17). The 
incidence increased among boys (P = 0.003) but not among girls (P = 0.40). The incidence 
of type 1 diabetes increased among Hispanic youths (P = 0.009), but the trends were not 
significant among youths of other racial or ethnic groups. No significant trends were 
identified within any of the study centers.
After adjustment for age, sex, and race or ethnic group, significant (P<0.05) increases in 
trends were identified in all age groups except the group of participants who were 0 to 4 
years of age, among both boys and girls, in each racial and ethnic group except Asian or 
Pacific Islanders and Native Americans, and within each study center except Ohio (Table 2). 
However, significant differences in the trends were not observed within demographic 
subgroups except within the subgroups of race or ethnic group (overall P<0.05).
The adjusted incidence of type 1 diabetes increased significantly more among Hispanic 
youths (annual increase, 4.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5 to 5.9) than among non-
Hispanic white youths (annual increase, 1.2%; 95% CI, 0.2 to 2.2; P<0.001 for pairwise 
comparison) (Fig. 1). The test for a quadratic trend was not significant (t = −1.8, P = 0.08), 
so linear models were retained. We estimated that approximately 15,900 cases of type 1 
diabetes were diagnosed annually in the United States in the 2002–2003 period,17 and this 
number increased to 17,900 cases annually in the 2011–2012 period. Overall, the adjusted 
annual relative increase in the incidence of type 1 diabetes was 1.8% (95% CI, 1.0 to 2.6; 
P<0.001).
INCIDENCE TRENDS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES
Among youths who were 10 to 19 years of age, unadjusted models revealed significant 
increases in the incidence of type 2 diabetes (from 9.0 cases per 100,000 youths per year in 
2002–2003 to 12.5 cases per 100,000 youths per year in 2011–2012; annual increase, 7.1%; 
P<0.001), with increases observed across all age, sex, race or ethnic-group, and study-site 
subgroups (P<0.01 for all comparisons) except among non-Hispanic whites and among 
youths at the Ohio site (Table 3). In adjusted analyses, significant differences within 
demographic subgroups were observed with respect to race or ethnic group (overall P<0.05) 
(Table 3 and Fig. 1). Specifically, the pairwise comparisons of the adjusted percent annual 
increase in incidence showed that the trend among non-Hispanic whites (0.6%; 95% CI, 
−2.0 to 3.4) was lower than the trends among non-Hispanic blacks, Asians or Pacific 
Islanders, and Native Americans (P<0.05 for all pairwise comparisons). The trend of the 
increase in incidence among Hispanics (3.1%; 95% CI, 0.8 to 5.4) differed significantly 
from that among Native Americans (8.9%; 95% CI, 5.0 to 13.1; P = 0.01).

 Some significant differences according to study center were observed. The incidence of type 
2 diabetes increased at all study sites except Ohio (P<0.05 for all adjusted center-specific 
pairwise contrasts) and increased to a lesser extent in California than in South Carolina (P = 
0.04) or Washington (P = 0.004). The test for a quadratic trend was not significant (t = −1.1, 
P = 0.27). We estimated that approximately 3800 cases of type 2 diabetes were diagnosed 
annually in the 2002–2003 period,17 and the number increased to 5300 annually in the 
2011–2012 period. Overall, after adjustment for age, sex, and race or ethnic group, the 
annual relative increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes was 4.8% (95% CI, 3.2 to 6.4; 
P<0.001).
DISCUSSION
The annual incidence of both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes among youths in the 
United States showed significant linear increases in the 2002–2012 period. We previously 
found an increase in the prevalence of type 1 diabetes in the 2001–2009 period2 and an 
increase in the incidence of type 1 diabetes among non-Hispanic white youths in the 2002–
2009 period.16 In the current analyses, the incidence of type 1 diabetes increased among 
Hispanic youths significantly more than among non-Hispanic white youths. Using data from 
the Colorado Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus Study Registry (1978–1988 period) and 
the SEARCH registry (2002–2004 period), Vehik et al.14 found an annual increase in the 
incidence of type 1 diabetes among both non-Hispanic white youths and Hispanic youths. 
From the same population,27 the frequency of the highest-risk type 1 diabetes genotype was 
higher among children who received a diagnosis between 1978 and 1988 than among those 
who received a diagnosis between 2002 and 2004. These data suggest an increased 
contribution of as-yet-unidentified environmental or behavioral factors, such as dietary, 
infectious, or psychosocial factors, to the incidence of type 1 diabetes.28
The increase in the incidence of type 1 diabetes suggests a growing disease burden that will 
not be shared equally. Studies have shown substantial differences among racial and ethnic 
groups in the methods of treatment29,30 and in clinical outcomes,31–34 as well as barriers 
associated with processes and quality of care.35 These findings highlight the critical need to 
identify approaches to reduce disparities among racial and ethnic groups.
Previously, we found that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes increased in the 2001–2009 
period, with significant increases among non-Hispanic white youths, non-Hispanic black 
youths, and Hispanic youths. The increase in prevalence was not seen among Asian or 
Pacific Islander youths or among Native American youths.2 Here, we report a significant 
annual increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in all racial and ethnic groups except non-
Hispanic whites. The numbers of cases in the Asian-Pacific Islander and Native American 
subgroups are markedly lower than in any other subgroup. Thus, the sample size accrued 
over a period of 11 years may have provided sufficient power to detect significant incidence 
trends that were not observable in the comparison of prevalence from only two time points.
Although there was no significant increase in the prevalence of obesity among U.S. youths 
from the 2003–2004 period to the 2011–2012 period overall,36 increases in the prevalence of 
obesity were observed among Hispanic girls and among non-Hispanic black boys.37

 Variations in the underlying prevalence of obesity over time may contribute to variations in 
insulin resistance and to the increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes. Factors that contribute 
to compromised insulin secretion are not well known and may include epigenetic 
dysregulation, which is yet to be elucidated.38
This study has certain limitations. Despite a representative sample,2 a large number of 
youths in the surveillance networks, and the high estimated proportion of total cases that 
were ascertained, statistical power was limited in subgroup-specific analyses in demographic 
subgroups that had a low incidence of type 1 diabetes (e.g., Native Americans) or type 2 
diabetes (e.g., non-Hispanic whites). Longer follow-up will be required in order to establish 
long-term trends.
We found significant increases in the annual incidence of both type 1 diabetes and type 2 
diabetes among youths in the United States. We found variation across racial and ethnic 
groups, including high relative increases in the incidence of type 1 diabetes among Hispanic 
youths and in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in racial and ethnic groups other than non-
Hispanic whites. Variation across demographic subgroups may reflect varying combinations 
of genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors that contribute to diabetes. As is consistent 
with the trends as modeled by Imperatore et al.,39 a linear increase in the incidences of type 
1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes will substantially increase the number of youths with diabetes 
in the United States, particularly youths from minority racial and ethnic groups that are a 
growing proportion of the U.S. population.

 Figure 1. Model-Adjusted Incidence Estimates
Shown are model-adjusted incidence estimates per 100,000 youths. The incidence of type 1 
diabetes was assessed among participants who were 0 to 19 years of age, and the incidence 
of type 2 diabetes among participants who were 10 to 19 years of age. P values are for the 
linear trend tests in each racial or ethnic group, according to type of diabetes. Significant 
results suggest a positive annual rate of increase during the study period.

*Rates were based on the number of cases and the number at risk in the given year and the preceding year (2-year moving average). P values are from a generalized autoregressive moving average 
(GARMA) linear model unless otherwise noted. The 95% confidence intervals for the yearly data are provided in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix. CI denotes confidence interval.
†The analysis was adjusted for age, sex, and race or ethnic group (age was adjusted for sex and race or ethnic group; sex was adjusted for age and race or ethnic group; race or ethnic group was adjusted for 
age and sex; and study site was adjusted for age, sex, and race or ethnic group).
‡P values are from linear negative binomial model, because the GARMA model was unable to estimate them.

*Rates were based on the number of cases and the number at risk in the given year and the preceding year (2-year moving average). P values are from the GARMA linear model unless otherwise noted. The 
95% confidence intervals for the yearly data are provided in Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix.
†The analysis was adjusted for age, sex, and race or ethnic group (age was adjusted for sex and race or ethnic group; sex was adjusted for age and race or ethnic group; race or ethnic group was adjusted for 
age and sex; and study site was adjusted for age, sex, and race or ethnic group).
‡P values are from linear negative binomial model, because the GARMA model was unable to estimate them.
