Motor units are the fundamental elements responsible for muscle movement. They are formed by lower motor
neurons and their muscle targets, synapsed via neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). The loss of NMJs in neuro-
degenerative disorders (such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or spinal muscle atrophy) or as a result of trau-
matic injuries affects millions of lives each year. Developing in vitro assays that closely recapitulate the physiology
of neuromuscular tissues is crucial to understand the formation and maturation of NMJs, as well as to help unravel
the mechanisms leading to their degeneration and repair. We present a microfluidic platform designed to co-
culture myoblast-derived muscle strips and motor neurons differentiated from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs)
within a three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel. The device geometry mimics the spinal cord–limb physical separation
by compartmentalizing the two cell types, which also facilitates the observation of 3D neurite outgrowth and
remote muscle innervation. Moreover, the use of compliant pillars as anchors for muscle strips provides a quan-
titative functional readout of force generation. Finally, photosensitizing the ESC provides a pool of source cells that
can be differentiated into optically excitable motor neurons, allowing for spatiodynamic, versatile, and noninvasive
in vitro control of the motor units.
INTRODUCTION
Motor units, consisting of lower motor neurons (MNs) and the muscle
fibers that they innervate via neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), are the
fundamental elements responsible for producing virtually all motor
functions, from locomotion to respiration or speech. Their failure is
associated with highly incapacitating or lethal genetic disorders, such
as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscle atrophy (SMA),
or Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) (1), or traumatic injuries.
Serving as a model for synaptic function, motor units have been the ob-
ject of previous pioneering work that led to the identification of neuro-
transmitters and their quantal release (2,3).Invertebrates,NMJfunction
involves numerous specialized cell types, from astrocytes secreting
supporting factors to Schwann cells providing electrical and chemical iso-
lation (4, 5). Commonly used primitive animal models, such as aplysia,
Caenorhabditis elegans, or Drosophila larva, provide important but
limited insight into the physiology of vertebrate and mammalian NMJs
due to fundamental differences in these models, such as the absence of
synapse elimination and remodeling, the presence of glutamatergic
MNs or inhibitory NMJs, and the absence of myelin sheath (6–8). On
the other hand, mammalian in vivo models are complex and not ame-
nable to systematic parameter tuning.
Development of in vitro systems that mimic their in vivo counter-
parts and allow for de novo NMJ formation therefore remains a high
priority. Traditional two-dimensional (2D) culture platforms, advanta-
geous for their simplicity, typically consist of a layer of myotubes differ-
entiated from myoblasts onto which MNs are uniformly plated (9–17).
These 2D mixed culture systems, using various combinations of human,
rodent, or chick cells, have been used for decades and have contributed
greatly to our understanding of the fundamental physiology of NMJs;
examples include acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering (9), the role
of Schwann cells on NMJ formation (10), or the regulation of acetylcho-
linesterase activity (11). They have also proven to be efficient tools to
investigate the functionality of healthy (12, 13) and dysfunctional (14)
stem cell–derived MNs and have served to optimize in vitro neuron/
muscle culture conditions (15–17).
However, their simplicity can, at times, be outweighed by their
limitations. The 2D nature of the system leads to a mismatch between
the mechanical properties of the cells and the substrate that can impede
muscle differentiation (18) or affect neurite outgrowth (19, 20) and pre-
clude direct interaction between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the
resident neurons and muscle cells (21, 22). The mixed nature of the
cultures makes it difficult to monitor individual cell types or axonal out-
growth and hinders the proper supply of tissue-specific factors or drugs.
Moreover, the contraction generated by the muscle tissue can only be
qualitatively assessed. Finally, these traditional platforms do not favor
high throughput and limit scientists’ ability to automate cell handling
and data acquisition.
Over the years, progress has been made toward addressing some of
these limitations associated with the traditional assays. Campenot
chambers (23) have been used for compartmentalized 2D cocultures
to study synapse elimination (24) or allow for enhanced visualization
of axonal outgrowth (25). Microfluidic devices confer a higher through-
put while increasing manipulability and control over culture conditions
and have been proposed and applied to remotely innervate cardiac cells
with autonomic neurons (26, 27) or skeletal muscle cells with MNs
(28–31). Other systems enable culture in a 3D configuration in an
attempt to increase the physiological relevance. They take the form
of organotypic spinal cord slices in contact with myoblast-laden fibrin
gels (32) or microdevices inspired by 3D muscle culture systems

 (33, 34), allowing the formation of 3D muscle bundles onto which MN-
containing neurospheres were seeded (35). However, these configura-
tions lacked clear physical separation between cell types. Finally, some
platforms have used compliant substrates to quantitatively infer muscle
contraction, whether by plating the cells on arrays of microneedles (36),
flexible membranes (37), or silicon cantilevers (38, 39). This latter con-
cept was the basis for a study that reported the formation of functional
NMJ between MNs and muscle cells plated onto these cantilevers and
the high-throughput and quantitative assessment of neuromuscular
physiology and drug response (40).
Here, we present an in vitro platform that is made more “physiolog-
ically relevant” by allowing simultaneous 3D coculture and compart-
mentalization of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC)–derived MNs
and skeletal muscle cells within an ECM. This platform capitalizes on
microfluidic designs for 3D cell culture (41–43) and the use of passive
force transducers for quantitative measurement of muscle contraction
(44, 45) [reviewed in the study by Uzel et al. (46)]. The system enables
the culture of functional differentiated MNs and myofibers, the obser-
vation of 3D axonal outgrowth with the hydrogel, and the formation of
functional NMJs.
To facilitate MN excitation and provide a means of rapid, spatially
resolved and noninvasive MN activation, we use the optically excitable
cation channel Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). ChR2 and other opsins of
the same family have proven to be valuable and versatile tools in neu-
roscience (47, 48) and have been widely used in in vivo models to stim-
ulate NMJs (49–52). Here, we photosensitize an mESC line with an
optimized ChR2 (ChR2H134R) and subsequently differentiate these cells
into MNs to optically induce action potentials (APs) and interrogate
the NMJ. This method, recently applied to ESCs overexpressing glia-
derived neurotrophic factors (GDNFs) for enhanced survival (53) and
even more recently to human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells (54),
foreshadows how any pluripotent cell lines (a fortiori patient-derived
iPS cells) can provide consistent optogenetically modified MNs. After
characterizing the optogenetic targeting of the ESC and the optical ex-
citability of the ChR2H134R-ESC–derived MNs, we demonstrate their
ability to trigger the contraction of muscle cells first in a traditional dish
assay, as well as in our new 3D compartmentalized microfluidic device.
RESULTS
ChR2H134R-expressing mESCs differentiate into
light-activatable MNs
Photosensitization of the mESC line HBG3 [expressing cytosolic green
fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the MN-specific Hb9
promoter] was carried out by knocking in tdTomato-tagged ChR2H134R
to the ROSA26 locus via homologous recombination (fig. S1). One
clone, exhibiting (i) membrane-bound tdTomato signal, (ii) ES mor-
phology (tight and dome-shaped colonies), and (iii) single-copy
insertion in the ROSA26 locus as evidenced by Southern blotting, was
selected (Fig. 1A and fig. S1, B to D). The transfection process and pres-
ence of the transgene had no significant effect on the pluripotency of the
transgenic ESC line (ChR2H134R-HBG3) relative to the parental line
(HBG3), as demonstrated by immunostaining of Oct4 (Fig. 1A) and
the RNA expression levels of five pluripotency markers (Oct4, Nanog,
Sox2, Esrrb, and Klf4) (fig. S1E).
ESCs were then differentiated into MNs following a published
protocol (55) consisting of the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs)
and exposure to retinoic acid (RA) and smoothened agonist (SAG)
(see Supplementary Materials and Methods). By day 6 of differentiation,
MNs could be identified by their GFP expression while retaining a
strong expression of tdTomato::ChR2H134R throughout the neuro-
spheres (Fig. 1B). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) data
(green channel for Hb9 and red channel for ChR) showed that a large
majority of Hb9GFP+ neurons still expressed tdTomato::ChR2H134R
(93.7 ± 7.9%; n = 6) (Fig. 1C), indicating that differentiation does not
interfere with transgene expression. Both double-positive ChR2H134R-
HBG3–derived MNs (ChR2H134R-HBG3-MN) and Hb9GFP+ parental
HBG3–derived MNs (HBG3-MN) extended neurites within minutes
following plating and assumed similar neuronal morphologies, suggest-
ing proper development of the ChR2H134R-HBG3-MN with respect to
their parental line. All ChR2H134R-HBG3-MN retained ChR2H134R ex-
pression (Fig. 1D) over a period extending beyond 16 days after plating,
indicating no signs of long-term silencing of the transgene. As expected,
both cytosolic GFP and membrane-bound ChR2H134R were present
throughout the entire cell (somata and neurites) (Fig. 1D).
The functionality of Channelrhodopsin in ChR2H134R-HBG3-MN
and its ability to evoke APs was validated by patch clamp. Whole-cell
recording was performed on double-positive MNs on days 3, 10, and 16
after plating. Resting membrane potential, resistance, and capacitance
measurements revealed no differences between HBG3-MN and
ChR2H134R-HBG3-MN (fig. S2A), suggesting no alteration of the basal
electrical properties following ESC targeting, and are consistent with
previous reports on HBG3-MN (13). Peak (IP) and steady-state (ISS)
photocurrents of the ChR2H134R-HBG3-MN during photostimulation
were found to be −142 ± 30 pA and −84 ± 20 pA, respectively, on day 3,
reaching −3.8 ± 1.9 nA and −385 ± 71 pA by day 10 and −4.7 ± 1.7 nA
and −588 ± 230 pA by day 16 (Fig. 1, E and F), whereas the ChR-free
parental HBG3-MN remained unresponsive to optical stimulation (Fig.
1E). As expected, elicited currents decreased with stimulation light in-
tensity and with a shift of wavelength from blue to green excitation (fig.
S2B). AP could be evoked in all cells from day 3 to day 16 (Fig. 1G). By
day 10 onward, trains of AP could be elicited upon sustained illumina-
tion, consistent with natural neuronal maturation. Stimulation wave-
length, irradiance, pulse frequency, and pulse width dependence on
inward currents and AP elicitation were also characterized and yielded
similar results as previously reported on optogenetically modified pri-
mary hippocampal or hES-derived neurons (fig. S2, B to F) (48, 56).
These results fully validate the ability to form optically excitable MNs
from a photosensitized standard mESC line.
ChR2H134R-HBG3–derived MNs can stimulate muscle
contraction in adherent in vitro cultures
We next demonstrated the ability of the ChR2H134R-HBG3-MN to
form functional NMJs with C2C12-derived skeletal muscles. This in
vitro demonstration of optically excitable NMJs was conducted using
a traditional dish assay, consistingof dissociated MN plated on top of a
layer of contractile myotubes, commonly used for MN-muscle cocul-
tures (13, 17). As early as 6 hours after plating, neurite outgrowth
could be seen, and by day 1, the first contacts with muscle cells were
observed (Fig. 2A). The first muscle contractions could be optically
triggered by day 3, consistent with results reported with electrically
stimulated NMJ in vitro (17). This phenomenon was monitored for
another 3 days during which the light-driven muscle contraction per-
sisted (Fig. 2, B and C, fig. S3A, and movie S1). This was further con-
firmed by the inhibition of light-induced muscle contraction in the

 presence of a-bungarotoxin (aBTX), an AChR antagonist (17 of 17
myocytes, which was light-responsive before aBTX treatment, showed
inhibition after treatment) (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the presence of sponta-
neous twitches after aBTX application was a confirmation that the
treatment did not alter the contractility of the myocytes (fig. S3B).
To test the versatility and spatial selectivity of optogenetic stimula-
tion of NMJ, we reduced the diameter of the excitation light beam to
~100 mm, delivering illumination to defined locations in the vicinity
of the myotube. When optically exciting one neighboring cluster of
MNs (Fig. 2C, i, region 3), no contraction was observed (Fig. 2C, ii, trace
2), a result similar to the one obtained by illuminating the muscle cell
alone (Fig. 2C, i, region 2, and ii, trace 3), indicating that that particular
cluster of neurons did not form functional NMJs with that myotube.
However, when illuminating another neuron cluster (Fig. 2C, i, region
4), the muscle exhibited the same contraction pattern as when the whole
field of view was uniformly stimulated (Fig. 2C, i, region 1, and ii, traces
1 and 4). This illustrates the selectivity of optogenetic stimulation and
shows how localized optical excitation can help decipher connectivity
patterns.
Design of the microfluidic device allows for 3D and
compartmentalized coculture of MNs and muscle bundles
The new 3D platform developed in this study capitalizes on key
advances featured in existing muscle and NMJ cultures in that it com-
bines the coculture compartmentalization of MNs and myofibers, as
found in 2D systems, the force sensing capability, and the 3D nature
of the mechanically compliant matrix surrounding the cells. Neuro-

 receive the muscle strip (Fig. 3, A and C). Each channel is separated
from its neighbors by a row of posts, which provide confinement during
gel and cell seeding while still allowing cell-cell signaling and nutrient
supply. The height of the channels is 320 mm throughout the device,
allowing for the tissue to experience a full 3D environment. A necking
of the gel region allows for the formation of two independent and
isolated tissues, each ~1 mm long (Fig. 3A), doubling the throughput
of the platform. The bottom section of the platform is a thin membrane
of PDMS (~100 mm), bonded to a coverslip for rigidity, featuring two
sets of two capped pillars (Fig. 3B). The 15-mm difference between the
top of the pillar and the roof of the channel allows for pillar deflection.
Following proper sterilization, the platform is assembled by affixing the
top section to the bottomone suchthat the pillarsline up in the center of
the muscle channels (Fig. 3, A and C) (see Supplementary Materials and
Methods). This design is unique in its ability to culture MNs and muscle
cells in a 3D environment while keeping them physically separated. This

 facilitates the monitoring of axonal outgrowth in a functional context,
and potentially providing cell-specific factors or drugs.
The following stepwise seeding procedure was optimized to account
for the myoblast-induced compaction of the hydrogel occurring within
hours of C2C12-laden matrix seeding, which prevents simultaneous
coseeding and in situ codifferentiation of both cell types (Fig. 4). First,
C2C12 cells, suspended in a collagen-Matrigel solution, were seeded
into the rightmost channel of the device containing the pillars (Figs.
3C and 4, day 0). Following gel compaction (Fig. 4, day 1, and movie
S2), resulting in gel fiber rearrangement and myoblast alignment
(35, 57), thin pieces of tissue remained, connecting the muscle strips
togetherandtothegelfillingportsandpreventingthemfromcontracting
independently from each other. To allow pillar deflection upon muscle
contraction, the separation and mechanical decoupling of the muscle
strips was accomplished by a manual ablation. Another technique invol-
ving two-photon laser excitation was also developed and is described in
more detail in Supplementary Materials and Methods. After removing
the reversibly bonded top layer of the device, a needle was used to per-
formincisionstothemusclestripsatadistanceof~500mmfromthepillar
(Fig. 4, day 2). The total resorption of the small “tails” left by the abla-
tion was completed over the following day, resulting in well-delineated
muscle bundles (fig. S4, B and C). After ablation, differentiation was in-
duced by switching to a myogenic differentiation medium. The expres-
sion of a-actinin and the formation of striated sarcomeric structures,
indicative of proper differentiation, were visualized by immunostaining
and confocal imaging (Fig. 5A and fig. S5D). The muscle bundle exhib-
itedaninitial75%compaction followingseeding, reaching~85%on day 6,
and its width finally stabilized to 25% of the original dimension (Fig. 5B)
To monitor contractile activity and functionally assess myogenic
differentiation, we optogenetically modified C2C12 cells and optically
stimulated the muscle strips derived from these cells (fig. S5) [the
C2C12 photosensitization was performed similarly to previous studies
(57, 58); see Supplementary Materials and Methods]. Light-induced
contractions were initially observed on day 3 after induction. Through-
out the entire process, passive tension (FP) and active contraction (FA)
were measured by monitoring pillar deflection (see Supplementary
Materials and Methods). Both were comparable to those measured in
previous in vitro platforms (33, 57), with passive tension reaching a pla-
teau after day 7 at ~18 mN and tetanus occurring at 10 Hz (Fig. 5C and
fig. S5C). Overall, there was no evidence to suggest that confinement of
the myoblasts to a microfluidic chamber altered myogenesis.
Neuron-muscle cocultures in the microfluidic devices were initiated
by seeding the ChR2H134R-HBG3–derived neurospheres into the device
after 7 days of differentiation (Fig. 4, day 7). After reassembling an

 open-reservoir variant of the microfluidic device onto the muscle strip
under a stereomicroscope, the medium was aspirated from the reser-
voirs, and the one contained in all channels was flushed with a collagen-
Matrigel mix prepared on ice (see Materials and Methods). Neurospheres
~300 to 400 mm in diameter were manually selected, resuspended with
the same chilled collagen-Matrigel mixture as above, and individually
pipettedintotheleftmostchannel(Figs.4and5D)beforethedeviceswere
placed in the incubator for matrix gelation, after which medium was sup-
plied to both open reservoirs. The diameter of the neurospheres being
greater than the interpost distance ensured their restriction to the as-
signed channel, resulting in a physical separation of ~1 mm between
the neurons and the muscles.
Because this platform was the first to create a matrix-embedded
muscle strip anchored to compliant pillars, as opposed to the existing
stand-alone ones suspended in medium (44, 45), we characterized the
effect of the presence of the gel on the force exerted by the muscle on the
pillars. This was achieved by measuring the force applied to the pillars
before and after gel seeding (on the basis of the assumption that the

 force generated by the muscle is not altered during the ~20-min polym-
erization process). Considering the poroelastic properties of hydrogel,
we anticipated that its mechanical contribution would bias the force
measurement (fig. S6A). However, results revealed no significant
changes in the peak or steady-state force, along with the rate of force
increase (fig. S6, B and C), suggesting that the contributions of the
viscoelastic/poroelastic properties of the gel were negligible. Therefore,
the force generated by the muscle strip can be determined from pillar
deflection without correcting for matrix viscoelasticity.
One day after seeding, motor neurites could be seen extending from
the neurospheres, as evidenced by the presence of Hb9GFP+ processes in
the gel (Fig. 5, D and E). All Hb9GFP+ neurites were also positive for
ChR2H134R, confirming once more minimal silencing of the transgene.
Some Hb9GFP−/ChRtdTom+ neurites were also observed (fig. S7A), in-
dicative of the presence of non-MN cells, most likely interneurons as
previously reported in HBG3 ESCs differentiated under similar
conditions (59). Maximum axon outgrowth rate was measured to be
10.4 ± 5.6 mm h−1 over the course of the first 4 days [consistent with
the axon 3D outgrowth reported in the literature (19, 60)], after which
all muscle strips were contacted by motor axons (Fig. 5, E to G). Inter-
estingly, the direction and rate of outgrowth were not found to be biased
by the presence of the muscle strip (fig. S7B). The spatial segregation of
the two cell types provides a unique opportunity to visualize the 3D ax-
on outgrowth toward the muscle. Confocal imaging was used to assess
the distribution of extended neurites within the thickness of the gel at
different stages of the coculture within the central channel (Fig. 5H and
movie S3). Images reveal that no plane was preferred for neurite
outgrowth as they extended homogeneously throughout the gel.
ChR2H134R-HBG3–derived MNs remotely innervate myofibers
and activate muscle contraction upon illumination in the 3D
microfluidic device
Glutamate, the natural excitatory neurotransmitter for lower MNs
and commonly used to demonstrate the presence of functional NMJs,
was added to the medium at a concentration of 400 mM and intro-
duced to the leftmost channel of the device, adjacent to the gel region
that houses the neurospheres. The first muscle contraction, indicative
of the presence of functional NMJs, was recorded 80 s after glutamate
administration, and the twitching frequency rose during the subse-
quent 120 s to reach a steady value of ~1.25 Hz (Fig. 6A). The delay
in contraction and increase of the twitching frequency are likely due to
the diffusion of the glutamate to the MNs embedded in the ECM be-
cause this lag is absent in adherent 2D cultures (61) or 3D constructs
in suspension (35).
The use of our ChR2H134R-HBG3-MN enabled faster and more con-
trollable muscle stimulation. Light-driven muscle contraction could be
recorded 5 days following neurosphere seeding (day 12), with no dis-
cernable patterns in amplitude or frequency, and persisted until the end
of the 16-day experiment period, demonstrating the robust nature of the
NMJs in this device (Fig. 6B and movie S4). Contractile forces measured
by the compliant pillars were on the order of ~1.5 mN, comparable to
those obtained by glutamate stimulation. Similar to the 2D case, the
application of aBTX inhibited muscle contraction, confirming the
functionality of NMJs in the 3D device (Fig. 6B). Moreover, we ob-
served that the distal part of motor axons colocalized with aBTX-
stained AChR, a visual assessment of the presence of NMJs (Fig.
6C). Sustained light illumination was found to generate multiple
muscle twitches (Fig. 6, B and D), with frequency increasing as the
stimulation light intensity increased (Fig. 6, D and E), consistent with
the patterns of trains of AP generated under the same stimulation
conditions (Fig. 1). However, no muscle tetanus could be generated.
We found that the maximum force generated via neuronal stimulation
(chemical or optical) yielded forces 70% that of the maximum force
that could be generated via electrical excitation or by optically stimu-
lating ChR2H134R-expressing C2C12-derived muscle bundles, suggesting
an incomplete innervation of the whole muscle strips by the same factor
(assuming that all myofibers can generate similar levels of contraction).
DISCUSSION
The combination of microfluidic and optogenetic technologies has
enabled the development of a highly controllable and physiologically
relevant in vitro model for motor units, with applications ranging from
fundamental scientific studies to drug screening assays. Light stimula-
tion of ChR-expressing ES-derived MNs provides great versatility over
the excitation of the tissue by making it cell-specific and more spatio-
temporally resolved than chemical stimulation. The PDMS-based
microfluidic platform encompasses technologies that bring together
essential aspects of neuromuscular tissue culture, namely, the 3D com-
partmentalized nature of the neuron-muscle coculture along with a
functional force readout.
The microfluidic chambers provide a 3D configuration similar to
that of the native tissue, where one channel serves as a surrogatefor the
spinal cord, whereas the other one models the remotely innervated
muscle tissue as found in the body wall or limbs. This culture system
confers not only a softer mechanical substrate that 2D systems often
lack but also the ability to investigate the role of the surrounding ECM.
Compartmentalization further facilitates visualization of axonal
outgrowth and innervation through a relevant matrix or the supply
of cell-specific chemical cues and would allow for the manipulation
of axons without interfering with other cell types. Finally, the integra-
tion of force sensors to the design offers a live, noninvasive, and quan-
titative assessment of muscle differentiation and contraction and
synapse function.
First, the ability to photosensitize nonaltered ESCs and differentiate
them into optically excitable MNs raises the potential for more versatile
ways of investigating disease models, such as SMA or ALS, by delivering
ChR to the commercially available patient-derived iPS cells, already
shown to be differentiable into functionalMNs (62, 63). Thisisaprocess
that could be combined with recent advances in transcriptional
programming that drastically increase the yield and decrease the dura-
tion of MN differentiation from human ESC and mESC (64, 65). The
demonstration of optically controlled NMJs in vitro will find ap-
plication in diverse fields. For instance, much is yet to be understood
regarding the process of NMJ maturation and remodeling, specifically
how activity or exercise is responsible for plastic synaptic adaptation
(24). The ability to selectively excite MNs or muscle cells [by selectively
expressing ChR in one or the other or taking advantage of wavelength-
specific opsin variants (66)] will greatly facilitate identifying the contri-
butions of each synaptic partner in their anterograde and retrograde
signaling (67–69). We also foresee applications in the fields of soft
robotics or nanorobotics, defined as microfabricated motile substrates
actuated by muscle cells recapitulating locomotive tasks (70–74).Theuse
of optogenetic MNs will provide a level of spatiotemporal control capable
of emulating the fine input command of the motor cortex.

 Overcoming the challenges of coculturing optogenetically modified
MNs and skeletal muscle cells in a microfluidic device, featuring a com-
pliant 3D matrix and in a spatially organized and compartmentalized
fashion, all contributed to creating an NMJ microenvironment that
brings together fundamental aspects of physiological neuromuscular
tissues. The confinement by a microfluidic chamber did not impair
myogenesis, and neither did the presence of the surrounding hydrogel.
The spontaneous axonal outgrowth allowed for a remote innervation
and emergence of light-excitable NMJs. Although the isotropic neurite
outgrowth could be the result of a weak chemotactic gradient gener-
ated by the muscle-derived factors, another explanation is that the
MNs are not mature enough to express the appropriate chemoattract-
ant receptor or that the subtype of MNs thus differentiated is ir-
responsive to the factors secreted by the muscle cell (75–77). The ability
to isolate the motor somata from the muscle cells is crucial for imaging
the navigation of axons within a wide extracellular space and could
prove useful in further understanding the process of nerve degenera-
tion and repair in a functional context. Moreover, with some further
engineering of the muscle consisting of fluorescently tagging the AChRs
(78) or postsynaptic scaffolding proteins, suchasRapsyn (79), one could
monitor the time course of synapse remodeling upon MN or muscle
stimulation (69). This feature is also the first of its kind to allow for
the supply of each cell type with its own medium in such a 3D envi-
ronment in the form of two opposite gradients [as demonstrated with
fluorescent tracers (fig. S8)]. This medium segregation could enhance
neuromuscular tissue survival and NMJ maturation in vitro, which
could be beneficial for long-term NMJ cultures (80). In addition, this
asymmetry of chemokine supply can be used in a variety of applica-
tions, from testing the influence of cytokine gradients in the context
of spinal cord development and axon pathfinding to the supply of cell-
specific drugs.
Although contact between motor neurites and muscle bundles was
observed by day 4 of coculture in all tissues, only ~50% of the muscle
constructs could be stimulated via neuronal excitation. This moderate
success rate in generating functional light-excitable NMJs and
incomplete innervation is likely attributable to poor accessibility of
the myofibers to the incoming growth cone, because some were found
within the muscle bundle. A potential solution to this problem could be
Fig. 6. Activation of NMJs within the microfluidic device. (A) Application of glutamate to the medium results in a delayed stimulation of the
muscle, leading to the initiation of muscle twitching with force (left y axis) at an increasing frequency (right y axis) as glutamate diffuses within the

 to form multiple thinner muscle strips as described recently, which
would provide more entry points to incoming axons (81, 82). Moreover,
the resulting force that was 70% of the maximum force generated by
total myofiber recruitment could find an extra explanation in the fact
that tetanus could not be observed in muscle bundles stimulated by the
MNs (whereas they were via direct electrical excitation). Although
consistent with the existing studies conducted on NMJ formed in vitro
with either C2C12 or primary myoblasts (15, 30, 35, 40), these systems
could benefit from both recent myogenesis protocols from heteroge-
neous primary muscle cultures resulting in physiologic force generation
(83), and genetically modified GDNF-expressing ESC-derived MNs
leading to higher survival and firing rate (53).
To further increase the physiological relevance of the system, other
cell types could be added to the culture. This could be done either by
taking advantage of, or even tuning, the heterogeneity of the differen-
tiated cells within the neurospheres (the non-MN ChR2-expressing
cells in fig. S7A are likely to be interneurons interacting via excitatory
or inhibitory signals) or by complementing the surrounding matrix
with supporting cells. For instance, Schwann cells, responsible for axon
guidance, myelination, nerve repair (84), or NMJ formation and
function (5, 10), could be added to the surrounding hydrogel. Doing
so could also provide precious functional and quantitative insight
in the myelination process along with demyelinating neuropathies,
such as the Guillain-Barre syndrome (85) or Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease (86).
The integration of compliant micropillars as anchoring points for
the muscle bundles allows for a rapid, passive, and noninvasive assess-
ment of muscle passive tension and active contraction. In a drug-
screening assay, this contractile functional output provides a means
of assessing the downstream and cumulative efficacy of a drug on motor
unit recovery, a method used in the past in muscle bundle cultures (87)
or in NMJ culture on cantilevers (40) and termed high-content
screening. Ongoing work is focusing on increasing the throughput of
the system to make this possible and would provide a new addition
to the ever-growing list of organs on a chip (88).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Microfluidic device fabrication
The mold fabrication followed a process similar to previously re-
ported (41, 42). Briefly, designs were generated using AutoCAD
(Autodesk), and the patterns were transferred to a Mylar transpar-
ency mask using high-resolution printing (FineLine Imaging). Sil-
icon wafers were then fabricated by photolithography using an SU-8
photoresist (MicroChem). Unlike the top microfluidic part of the
device that was casting from a negative mold, the master for the bot-
tom pillar part was a positive version of it. All molds were surface-
treated overnight before any PDMS (Ellsworth Adhesives) casting
using (tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl)-1-trichlorosilane (United
Chemical Technologies). For the top microfluidic part, PDMS, mixed
at 10:1 base/curing agent, was poured onto the silicon mold at a height
of 5 mm, degassed in a desiccator, and cured at 80°C for at least
4 hours. Devices were then cut off the mold and trimmed to the ap-
propriate size, and gel filling ports, vacuum port, and medium ports/
reservoirs were formed with 1-, 2-, and 4-mm-diameter biopsy
punches, respectively. For the bottom pillar part, a negative version
of the mold was made with PDMS mixed at a 5:1 base/curing agent. It
was then silanized overnight, and the same PDMS mixture was spun
on top of the negative mold for 10 s at 500 rpm and 15 s at 1000 rpm,
yielding membranes with thicknesses of ~100 mm. The membrane
featuring the pillars was gently peeled off. Each pillar had a slight con-
ical shape, reminiscent of the microfabrication process, with basal and
tip diameters of 75 and 100 mm, respectively, and a height of 280 mm. The
membrane pillar devices were then bonded to a 20-mm × 20-mm cover-
slip by plasma activation (Harrick Plasma) for rigidity purposes. The caps
of the pillars consisted of 150-mm × 150-mm squares of 25-mm-thin
PDMS (obtained by spin-coating it on a 10-cm Petri dish lid for 30 s at
5000 rpm), manually positioned over the pillar, and glued with uncured
PDMS, which resulted in a total height of 305 mm. Both top and bottom
parts of the device were then cleaned by sonication in a bath of ethanol,
followed by a sonicated bath of deionized (DI) water. They were then
sterilized by a cycle of wet autoclaving, followed by dry autoclaving. The
parts were aligned and assembled using a stereomicroscope under ster-
ile conditions. After usage, the devices were cleaned by sonication in
ethanol and then DI water, sterilized by autoclaving (a wet cycle followed
by a dry cycle), and stored in a sterile container before further use. No
devices were used more than 10 times.
Cell culture and differentiation
Source cells. mESC line HBG3 (Hb9-GFP), a gift from H. Wichterle,
Columbia University, NY, was kept in culture on a feeder layer of
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (CF-1 MEF Feeder Cells, Applied StemCell)
plated on 0.1% gelatin–coated dishes in undifferentiated medium
consisting of EmbryoMax ES Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) (Millipore Chemicon), 15% ESC-qualified fetal bovine
serum (Invitrogen), 1% nucleosides (Millipore Chemicon), 1% non-
essential amino acids (Millipore Chemicon), 1% penicillin-streptomycin
(Invitrogen), 1% L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 0.1 mM b-mercaptoethanol
(Sigma), and 0.1% leukemia inhibitory factor (EMD). Mouse myoblasts
C2C12 (89) [American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)] were cultured
below 70% confluency in growth medium consisting of high-glucose
DMEM (ATCC), 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and 1% penicillin-
streptomycin. All cells were kept in incubators at 37°C and 5% CO2.
None of the cells were used beyond a passage number 20.
Motor neurons. The MN differentiation protocol was adapted
from published literature (55). Briefly, mESCs were collected from their
feeder layer culture and plated at 2 × 106 cells in 10 ml in a 10-cm Nunc
culture dish in differentiation medium, consisting of 1:1 Advanced
DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen)/Neurobasal (Invitrogen), 10% KnockOut
Serum Replacement (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitro-
gen), 1% L-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 0.1 mM b-mercaptoethanol
(Sigma). They were allowed to form EBs overnight. The next day,
EBs in suspension were collected and transferred to low-adhesion
culture dishes in 10 ml of differentiation; the cells that had attached
to the Nunc dishes were discarded. On day 2, the medium was changed
and supplemented with 1 mM RA (Sigma) and, on day 3, with 1 mM SAG
(EMD). The cells remained in this medium for two more days. On day 5,
the medium was replaced by differentiation medium supplemented
with GDNF (10 ng ml−1) (R&D Systems) and CNTF (10 ng ml−1)
(R&D Systems). EBs were used on day 7, either seeded in the microfluid-
ic devices or dissociated and FACS-sorted to isolate Hb9GFP+/
ChRtdTom+ MNs for plating on a glial feeder layer or muscle cell in
2D cultures.

 (PDL) (Sigma) coating solution at a concentration of 200 mg ml−1
and incubated at 37°C overnight. After PDL solution was washed
with DI water, a laminin coating solution (Invitrogen) was used at a
concentration of 10 mg ml−1 and incubated for at least 4 hours. The
laminin coating solution was rinsed once before glial cells (Supple-
mentary Materials) were plated at ~1 × 105 cells per dish and allowed
to form a monolayer over at least 5 days in high-glucose DMEM
(ATCC)containing10%HS(Invitrogen)and1%penicillin-streptomycin
(Invitrogen). Dissociated MNs were then plated at 1 × 105 cells per dish,
and the medium was switched to MN growth medium supplemented
with GDNF at 10 ng ml−1, CNTF at 10 ng ml−1, 3-isobutyl-1-
methylxanthine (IBMX) (Sigma) at 100 mM, and forskolin (Sigma) at
10 mM. Half of the medium was replaced every day until the cultures
were used for electrophysiological recordings.
MN–muscle cell coculture for NMJ in 2D. This procedure is a
modified version of a previously published one (17). Similar to the glial
cellculture, 35-mm Petri dishes were coated with PDL(200 mg ml−1) and
laminin (10 mg ml−1). C2C12 cells were plated at ~1 × 104 cells cm−2 and
cultured in growth medium. The next day, the medium was switched to
high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 2% HS and 1% penicillin-
streptomycin. Two days later, the medium was supplemented with cyto-
sine arabinoside (AraC) (Sigma-Aldrich) (1 mg ml−1) to eliminate the
nonfused myoblast, and another 2 days later, early myotubes were tryp-
sinized,replatedata1:2ratioonPDL-andlaminin-coated35-mmdishes,
andculturedinmediumconsistingof 1:110%HSmyogenic mediumand
neuronal differentiation medium supplemented with AraC (1 mg ml−1).
On day 4 after myogenic induction, dissociated and purified Hb9GFP+/
ChRtdTom+ MNs (see MN–glial cell coculture) were plated at 2 × 105 cells
per dish. AraC was withdrawn from the medium and replaced with
GDNF (5 ng ml−1), CNTF (5 ng ml−1), forskolin (5 mM), and IBMX
(50 mM). In the subsequent days, half of the medium was replaced.
Cell seeding and differentiation in the microfluidic device
Cell seeding in the microfluidic device. All 3D cell cultures in
the microfluidic devices were carried out in a collagen/Matrigel hydro-
gel in a 4:1 ratio. Rat tail type I collagen (Corning) was mixed on ice
with 10× phosphate-buffered saline with phenol red (serving as a pH
indicator), 0.5 N NaOH, and water for cell culture (Lonza) to
yield a collagen concentration of 2 mg ml−1 at a pH of 7.4. Matrigel
without growth factors (BD Biosciences) was thoroughly mixed
with the collagen at 20% of the final gel mixture volume. The gel
was then used within a few minutes following its preparation to
avoid pre-polymerization.
C2C12 cells were trypsinized, counted, and centrifuged for 5 min at
200 rcf. The pellet was then resuspended in the hydrogel at a final den-
sity of 2 × 106 cells ml−1. Shortly after resuspension, the hydrogel was
injected into the rightmost channel of the microfluidic device that had
been filled with medium before cell seeding. This later facilitated gel
compaction because it allowed for the formation of a thin layer of me-
dium that isolated the gel and the cells from the PDMS walls and re-
duced adhesion. The device was then placed in a humidified box and
incubated at 37°C. To prevent cells from settling at the bottom of the
device and ensuring a homogeneous distribution throughout the thick-
ness of the channels, the devices were first placed upside down for 4 min
and then rotated back to complete polymerization for the remaining
11 min. Growth medium was then supplied to the adjacent medium
channel by forming a seal between a large-orifice pipette tip and the
medium filling port and by pushing the medium into the channel. In
the following days, the medium would seep through the dry channels
to the left of the muscle chamber and fully wet all channels. The medi-
um was replaced by removing approximately 50 ml of the old medi-
um and replacing it with the same amount of fresh one. To prevent
cross-flow that could wash off the gel, the medium was aspirated and
supplied with a multichannel pipettor. The medium was changed every
24 hours.
Muscle differentiation. After tissue ablation (see Supplementary
Materials and Methods), the muscle bundles were supplied with myo-
genic medium consisting of 2% HS DMEM (Fig. 4). Three days after
induction, the medium was replaced by 10% HS myogenic medium
(more adequate for the metabolically active muscle strips) until device
reassembly and MN seeding.
Plasmid design and delivery
DNA constructs were created using standard molecular biology tech-
niques.Briefly,aChR2[H134R]-tdTomatoexpressioncassettewascloned
into the Ai9 ROSA26 targeting vector and linearized for mESC knock-
in (fig. S1A). Ai9 was a gift from H. Zeng (Addgene, plasmid no. 22799).
For lentiviral infection of C2C12 cells, ChR2[H134R]-tdTomato was
cloned downstream of an elongation factor 1a (EF1a) promoter in a
lentiviral plasmid (fig. S5A).
Mouse embryonic stem cell. The linearized ChR2[H134R]-
tdTomato Rosa26 targeting vector (0.4 mg) was delivered to the mESC
by nucleofection (Amaxa Nucleofector) for homologous recombina-
tion at the ROSA26 locus. Three days after plasmid delivery, a total of
nine colonies were manually selected, on the basis of their ES-like
morphologies and tdTomato expression, expanded, and tested for
specific integration by Southern blotting. One clone displaying specific
integration at the ROSA26 locus was selected for the rest of the study
(fig. S1).
C2C12. For lentivirus production, HEK293FT cells were seeded
into a T225 flask at 40% confluency 24 hours before transfection. Cells
were transfected with 10 mg of EF1a-ChR2[H134R]-tdTomato, 10 mg
of pMD2.G, 15 mg of psPAX2, 100 ml of Lipofectamine 2000 (Life
Technologies), and 200 ml of PLUS Reagent (Life Technologies). Six
hours after transfection, fresh medium was applied. Three days after
transfection, virus supernatant was harvested, filtered through a
0.45-mm polyvinylidene difluoride filter (Millipore), aliquoted, and
stored at −80°C. Lentiviral packaging plasmids (psPAX2 and pMD2.G)
were a gift from D. Trono (Addgene, plasmid nos. 12260 and 12259).
C2C12 cells were incubated with viral supernatant for 24 hours. The
cells were cultured for 3 days, then expanded for another 3 days, and
sorted by FACS. Fifty percent of the brightest cells were collected of the
12% of positive cells to tdTomato.
RNA extraction and reverse transcription quantitative
polymerase chain reaction for gene expression analyses
RNA was extracted using Izol (5 PRIME, 2302700) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted RNA (5 mg) was reverse-
transcribed using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies,
28025-013) and random hexamers according to the manufacturer’s
protocols. Quantitative polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were per-
formed with SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche). Relative mRNA levels
were determined in triplicate for each transcript using the manufacturer’s
software (Advanced Relative Quantification with Roche LightCycler 480
Software version 1.5) using Tubb5 transcript levels for normalization.
The primers used for gene expression analyses are listed below.

 Southern blot analyses
Genomic DNA was isolated from desired clones and digested with
Bam H1-HF overnight. The digested DNA was run on a 1% agarose
gel and transferred using the capillary transfer method. The clones were
analyzed for targeting using an internal probe against ChR. This 809–
base pair (bp) probe was amplified by PCR from the targeting vector
using the following PCR primers: 5′-tcctggtccctgaggatcaa-3′ (forward)
and 5′-gcggaacggagatcgaggtc-3′ (reverse). To check the correct target-
ing of the 5′ end, an 865-bp external probe was generated by digest-
ing a vector containing the Rosa26 promoter (pROSA26-promoter;
Addgene, no. 21710) with Sac I and Kpn 1.
Immunostaining
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and then solu-
bilized with 0.1% Triton X. After serum blocking, the cells were incu-
bated at 4°C overnight with the primary antibody. The following day,
the secondary antibody was administered for 2 hours at room tempera-
ture. Primary antibodies included anti-Oct4 (Abcam, 1:200) and anti-
sarcomeric a-actinin antibody (Abcam, 1:400). Secondary antibodies,
used at a 1:200 dilution, were goat anti-rabbit Texas Red (Invitrogen)
and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen). NMJs were inhibited
and stained in live or fixed cultures with Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated
aBTX(Invitrogen)for20mininmediumataconcentrationof5mgml−1.
Counterstaining was performed with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(Invitrogen, 1:1000).
Electrophysiological assay
For the patch clamp recordings, the FACS-sorted Hb9GFP+/ChRtdTom+
MNs were plated on primary mouse cortical glial cells (Supplementary
Materials). The glial cells were platedat a density of 1 × 104 cellscm−2 on
PDL-coated 35-mm Petri dishes and allowed to reach confluency. Re-
cordings were conducted on days 3, 10, and 16 after plating. The
Hb9GFP+/ChRtdTom+ MNs were identified under a conventional
inverted epifluorescence microscope (Axio Observer.A1, Zeiss) with a
20× objective lens [Plan-Neofluar; numerical aperture (NA), 0.4; Zeiss].
The formulation of the recording solutions was taken from past litera-
ture (64). The bath solution consisted of 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl,
10 mM HEPES, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glucose, and 2 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.3
adjusted with NaOH, 325 mOsm adjusted with sucrose). The patch
pipette solution contained 130 mM CH3KO3S, 10 mM CH3NaO3S,
1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM Mg–adenosine tri-
phosphate,and0.5mMNa2–guanosinetriphosphate(pH7.3,315mOsm).
The resistance of the electrodes was 4 to 8 megohms. Patch clamp
experiments were performed using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier
(Axon), and signals were digitized at 10 kHz with an Axon Digidata
1440A interface. Data were acquired with pClamp 10 software (Axon)
and processed with MATLAB (MathWorks). For all voltage clamp
experiments, the cells were held at a membrane potential of −60 mV.
APs were recorded while holding the neurons to approximately −60 mV
by injecting current with amplitudes no less than −300 pA. All record-
ings were conducted at room temperature.
Optical and electrical stimulation
All optical stimulations were performed using a SOLA light engine
(Lumencor) excitation unit, with emission peaks of interest located
at 470 and 540 to 550 nm. Blue and green lights were supplied through
Zeiss filter sets #38 (BP 470/40) and #20 (BP 546/12), respectively. Un-
less otherwise stated, the entire field of view was illuminated.
For the electrophysiological recordings, light was controlled by the
Clampex software and applied through the 20× objective, yielding a
maximum irradiance of 9 mW mm−2 as measured by a power meter
(Newport) at the sample plane. The optical stimulations of the myo-
fibers and MNs in adherent and microfluidic cultures were conducted
through a 10× objective, yielding an irradiance of 7.6 mW mm−2 and
controlled via an Arduino circuit board. Electrical stimulation was
delivered via platinum electrodes positioned 3 mm away from each oth-
er across the neuromuscular tissue and controlled by an Arduino circuit
delivering 9-V square inputs.
Image acquisition and analysis
Epifluorescence and confocal images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse
Ti-E inverted microscope and an Olympus FV-1000 confocal micro-
scope, respectively. 3D reconstruction and analysis of confocal images
were performed with the software Imaris (Bitplane). Automated track-
ing of the local deformation of the skeletal muscle cells and deflection of
the pillars upon light excitation was carried out using the tracking
software Tracker (http://physlets.org/tracker). The synchronization of
deformation tracking and optical stimulation was carried out by plot-
ting the average pixelintensity forevery image overtime and comparing
the increase of intensity to the muscle or pillar deformation curve (fig.
S3A). The blue bars correspond to periods of time when the light was on.
Image analysis for muscle width and axon outgrowth was conducted
in ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/). Maximum neurite growth rate was
defined as the speed of extension of the longest neurite with respect to
the border of the EB on seeding day. Electrophysiology and FACS data
were processed in MATLAB (MathWorks).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad
Software Inc.). Statistical significance analysis was done via t tests
or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and all tests resulting in
a P value less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
