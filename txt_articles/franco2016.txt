IMPORTANCE Between 40% and 50% of women in Western countries use complementary
therapies to manage menopausal symptoms.
OBJECTIVE To determine the association of plant-based therapies with menopausal
symptoms, including hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness.
DATA SOURCES The electronic databases Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central
were systematically searched to identify eligible studies published before March 27, 2016.
Reference lists of the included studies were searched for further identification
of relevant studies.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials that assessed plant-based therapies and the
presence of hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness.
DATA EXTRACTION Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers using a predesigned
data collection form.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness.
RESULTS In total, 62 studies were identified, including 6653 individual women. Use of
phytoestrogens was associated with a decrease in the number of daily hot flashes (pooled
mean difference of changes, −1.31 [95% CI, −2.02 to −0.61]) and vaginal dryness score (pooled
mean difference of changes, −0.31 [95% CI, −0.52 to −0.10]) between the treatment groups
but not in the number of night sweats (pooled mean difference of changes, −2.14 [95% CI,
−5.57 to 1.29]). Individual phytoestrogen interventions such as dietary and supplemental soy
isoflavones were associated with improvement in daily hot flashes (pooled mean difference
of changes, −0.79 [−1.35 to −0.23]) and vaginal dryness score (pooled mean difference of
changes, −0.26 [−0.48 to −0.04]). Several herbal remedies, but not Chinese medicinal herbs,
were associated with an overall decrease in the frequency of vasomotor symptoms. There
was substantial heterogeneity in quality across the available studies, and 46 (74%) of the
included randomized clinical trials demonstrated a high risk of bias within 3 or more areas
of study quality.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This meta-analysis of clinical trials suggests that composite
and specific phytoestrogen supplementations were associated with modest reductions in the
frequency of hot flashes and vaginal dryness but no significant reduction in night sweats.
However, because of general suboptimal quality and the heterogeneous nature of the current
evidence, further rigorous studies are needed to determine the association of plant-based
and natural therapies with menopausal health.

M
enopause is considered the end of a woman’
s repro-
ductive life, generally indicated by the time when
menstrual periods stop permanently.1 The meno-
pausal transition and its associated changes vary widely.2,3
Symptoms associated with menopause include hot flashes,
night sweats, and vaginal dryness, with 50.3% to 82.1% of
menopausal women reporting hot flashes or night sweats.4,5
Medical treatments for these symptoms are available, includ-
ing hormone replacement therapy. However, given the poten-
tially negative health consequences of hormone replacement
therapy on cardiovascular health and breast cancer,6,7 40% to
50% of women in Western countries choose to use comple-
mentary therapies, including plant-based therapies.8,9
A broad range of plant-based therapies may improve
menopausal symptoms. These therapies include the oral
use of phytoestrogens such as dietary soy isoflavones and
soy extracts; herbal remedies such as red clover and black
cohosh; and Chinese and other medicinal herbs. Although
associations of these therapies with menopausal symptoms
have been evaluated in randomized trials,10,11 most of these
studies were limited by inadequate power (ie, limited
sample size), a short follow-up period, suboptimal quality
(eg, high dropout rates), and inconsistent findings. Prior
summaries of evidence are limited by a focus on a specific
therapy (eg, phytoestrogens),12 evaluation of a specific
symptom (eg, hot flashes), and being nonquantitative13 or
largely nonsystematic14 in nature. Therefore, an updated
and comprehensive quantitative review is important, given
the large number of plant-based therapies used by women
to treat menopausal symptoms.
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of
intervention studies evaluating the association of plant-
based therapies with menopausal symptoms.
Methods
Data Sources and Search Strategy
This review was conducted using a predefined protocol and
in accordance with PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines.15,16
Three electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and
Cochrane Central) were searched until March 27, 2016, with-
out language restriction. The computer-based searches com-
bined terms related to (1) the exposures (or interventions,
where appropriate) such as herbal, phytoestrogens, soy, iso-
flavone, ginseng, black cohosh, Cimicifuga, ERr 731 rhubarb
raponticin, St John’
s wort, complementary medicine, tradi-
tional medicine, and Chinese medicine; (2) menopausal
symptoms (eg, hot flashes, night sweats, vasomotor symp-
toms, vaginal dryness, menopause); (3) study design
(eg, clinical trials, randomized clinical trials); and (4) relevant
population (eg, humans) (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement).
Two independent reviewers (T. V., S. K., and/or C. O.-W.)
screened the titles and abstracts of all studies initially identi-
fied, according to the selection criteria. Any disagreement
was resolved through consensus or consultation with a third
independent reviewer (T. M.). Full texts were retrieved from
studies that satisfied all selection criteria. Reference lists of
selected studies and reviews identified on the topic were
searched to identify additional publications.
Study Selection and Eligibility Criteria
Intervention studies were eligible if they were randomized
clinical trials (RCTs); assessed effects of any plant-based
therapy listed above in perimenopausal, menopausal, or post-
menopausal women, compared with a placebo or no treat-
ment; and collected end points for menopausal symptoms, in-
cluding hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness. To
maintain consistency and because of difficulty in interpret-
ing results without a placebo or control, head-to-head trials
without a placebo group that compared nonhormonal thera-
pies with estrogen or with other medications were excluded.
Study populations in the eligible trials included women expe-
riencingmenopausalsymptomsrecruitedfromhealthcareset-
tings or general populations. No restriction on length of
follow-up was applied.
Data Extraction
The exposures or interventions eligible for inclusion in the
current review were summarized using the following broad
groupings: (1) biologically based therapies including phytoes-
trogens (dietary soy isoflavones and supplements and
extracts of soy isoflavones, red clover isoflavones, and other
phytoestrogens), black cohosh and other biologically based
therapies such as flaxseed, St John’
s wort, wheat germ, and
St John’
s wort with chaste tree; and (2) medicinal herbs,
including Chinese medicinal herbs and other medicinal
herbs such as ERr 731 rhubarb raponticin. Two authors (S. K.,
C. O.-W.) independently extracted data and a consensus was
reached in case of any inconsistency with involvement of a
third author (T. M.). A predesigned electronic data abstrac-
tion form was used to extract relevant information. In
instances of multiple publications, the most up-to-date infor-
mation was extracted.
Assessing the Risk of Bias
Two reviewers (S. K., T. M.) independently rated the quality
of studies. The Cochrane Collaboration’
s tool17 was used to as-
sess the risk of bias. Detailed information on the assessment
of study quality and risk of bias is provided in eAppendix 2 in
the Supplement.
Statistical Analysis
Treatment effects were defined as the differences in out-
comes between the treatment and placebo at the end of the
trial. For continuous outcomes, summary measures were
presented as mean differences. For data reported as medians,
ranges, or 95% confidence intervals, we calculated means
and standard deviations as previously described.18 To enable
a consistent approach to the meta-analysis and enhance
interpretation of the findings, units of measurement were
converted where appropriate. Most crossover trials in this
review did not report adequate crossover analysis; therefore,
we used data from the first period only.19 The inverse vari-
ance weighted method was used to combine summary mea-
sures using random-effects models to minimize effects of

between-study heterogeneity.20 We also conducted sensitiv-
ity analyses using fixed-effects models. Heterogeneity was
assessed using the Cochrane χ2 statistic and the I2 statistic
and was distinguished as low (I2 ≤25%), moderate (I2 >25%
and <75%), or high (I2 ≥75%).21 We evaluated publication bias
using funnel plots and Egger regression symmetry tests.22
Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the influ-
ence of each individual study, omitting the studies that had
the largest effect on the overall result one by one. Further-
more, we restricted the analysis to studies that did not in-
clude participants with a history of breast cancer. Study-level
characteristicsincludinggeographiclocation,durationoftreat-
ment, number of total participants, and risk of bias were pre-
specifiedascharacteristicsforassessmentofheterogeneityand
were evaluated using stratified analyses and random-effects

descriptive summary tables were performed for these stud-
ies that could not be quantitatively pooled.
Alltestswere2-tailed;P≤.05wasconsideredstatisticallysig-

Results
Study Identification and Selection
We identified 5218 relevant citations. After screening titles and
abstracts, 192 articles were selected for detailed evaluation of
their full texts. Of those, 62 articles, based on 62 unique RCTs,
met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review: 52
unique studies about biologically based therapies (36 on phy-
toestrogensand16onblackcohoshandotherbiologicallybased
therapies) and 10 unique studies on medicinal herbs (Table 1,
Figure 1; eAppendix 3 in the Supplement).
Characteristics of Included Studies
The 62 RCTs reported results for 6653 unique women (Table 1;
eTables 1 and 2 in the Supplement). Twenty-one RCTs were
based in Europe; 17 in Asia-Pacific; 10 in North America; 7 in
South America; and 7 in the Middle East (Table 1). The base-
line age of participants ranged from 18 to 75 years (eTables 1
and 2 in the Supplement). The duration of the interventions

ranged from 4 weeks to 2 years, but the majority (28 studies)
had a 12-week intervention period (Table 1; eTables 1 and 2 in
the Supplement).
Biologically Based Therapies and Menopausal Outcomes
Thirty-six RCTs examined the association between any phy-
toestrogen use and menopausal symptoms (eTable 1 and
eTable 3 in the Supplement). Because of differences in the
outcomes assessed (eg, frequency of hot flashes, duration of
hot flashes, or use of vasomotor symptom scores), 15 RCTs
were not included in the meta-analysis. Therefore, data
from 21 RCTs contributed to the meta-analysis, which
showed an association of overall phytoestrogen use with a
decrease in the number of daily hot flashes (pooled mean
difference of changes between treatment groups, −1.31 [95%
CI, −2.02 to −0.61]) and in vaginal dryness scores (pooled
mean difference of changes between treatment groups,
−0.31 [95% CI, −0.52 to −0.10]) (Figure 2; eTable 4 in the
Supplement). The use of phytoestrogens was not associated
with significant changes in 24-hour night sweat (pooled

Phytoestrogens are defined as use of dietary soy isoflavones and supplements
and extracts of soy isoflavones, red clover isoflavones, and other
phytoestrogens. Sizes of data markers are proportional to the inverse of the
variance of the effect estimate. Vaginal dryness score was based on a 4-point
scale of severity: 0 = nonexistent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe.
Assessment of heterogeneity: number of hot flashes in 24 hours, I2 = 94%
(95% CI, 92%-98%; P < .001); number of night sweats in 24 hours, I2 = 99%
(95% CI, 98%-99%; P < .001); vaginal dryness score, I2 = 48% (95% CI,
0%-85%; P = .15). NR indicates not reported.

mean difference of changes, −2.14 [95% CI, −5.57 to 1.29])
(Figure 2; eTable 4 in the Supplement). Study-specific esti-
mates from studies (n = 15) not included in the meta-
analyses generally supported an association of phytoestro-
gen use with a decrease in the frequency of individual
menopausal symptoms, particularly in the number of hot
flashes within 24 hours (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Separatemeta-analyseswereperformedfordifferenttypes
of interventions, including evaluation of overall soy isofla-
vones (dietary, supplements, and extracts) (12 studies), di-
etary soy isoflavones (4 studies), supplements and extracts of
soy isoflavones (8 studies), and red clover isoflavones (7 stud-
ies) (Figure 3; eFigures 1, 2, and 3 in the Supplement). The re-
sults of the analyses restricted to any (dietary, supplemental,
and extracts) soy isoflavone use or to supplements and ex-
tracts of soy isoflavones or solely to dietary soy isoflavones in
general replicated the findings of the larger combined analy-
ses on daily hot flashes and vaginal dryness scores (eFigures
1, 2, and 3 in the Supplement). Because of the limited number
of studies, it was not possible to perform separate meta-
analysis for the association between different types of phy-
toestrogen interventions and number of night sweats in 24
hours. There was no association between red clover and num-
ber of hot flashes in 24 hours (Figure 3). One study examined
theassociationbetweenredcloveruseandnightsweatswithin
24 hours and showed a decrease in frequency of night sweats
(mean difference of changes within 24 hours, −3.90 [95% CI,
−4.50 to −3.30]).24
The association of black cohosh with menopausal symp-
toms was assessed in 9 RCTs. Data from 5 RCTs could not be
included in the meta-analysis because those studies either as-
sessed the association of black cohosh with different vasomo-
torsymptomsscoresorusedblackcohoshcombinedwithother
therapies. Therefore, data from only 4 RCTs contributed to the
meta-analysis. Overall, black cohosh was not associated with
changes in the number of hot flashes (pooled mean differ-
ence of changes within 24 hours, −0.71 [95% CI, −2.51 to 1.08])
(Figure 3; eTable 5 in the Supplement). Only 1 study assessed
theassociationofblackcohoshwiththenumberofnightsweats
within 24 hours; this study reported no difference (mean dif-
ferenceofchanges,0.08[95%CI,−0.30to0.47]).19Ofthestud-
ies of black cohosh that could not be included in the meta-
analysis, one study reported no difference in vasomotor
symptoms score,60 and 1 study reported a decrease in vaso-
motor symptoms score.61 Two other studies that combined
black cohosh with other therapies also reported a decrease in
vasomotor symptom score62,63 (eTable 6 in the Supplement).
Also, 1 study showed a decrease in vaginal dryness score with
the use of black cohosh (eTable 6 in the Supplement).25 Seven
additional studies of other biologically based therapies were
identified and are summarized in eTable 6 in the Supple-
ment. Four studies found an association with a decrease in
symptoms with therapies including evening primrose, flax-
seed, St John’
s wort, and combined therapies, whereas 3 stud-
ies of wheat germ, flaxseed, and St John’
s wort with chaste tree
found no difference (eTable 6 in the Supplement).

Medicinal Herbs and Menopausal Symptoms
Because of the limited number of studies, it was not pos-
sible to perform meta-analysis on the associations of
Chinese medicinal herbs and non-Chinese medicinal herbs
with menopausal symptoms. The results of the RCTs for the
association between use of Chinese medicinal herbs and
menopausal symptoms were not consistent but in general
showed no association (eTable 7 in the Supplement). One
RCT3 that used non-Chinese medicinal herbs reported a
decrease in the number of hot flashes within 24 hours
(mean difference of changes, −1.62 [95% CI, −2.29 to −0.95])
(eTable 7 in the Supplement). The beneficial association of
non-Chinese medicinal herbs on menopausal symptoms
was further supported by the studies that examined their
association with weekly vasomotor symptoms score or hot
flashes score (eTable 7 in the Supplement).
Sensitivity Analyses and Assessments of Bias, Study Quality,
and Heterogeneity
For pooled analyses involving 5 or more studies, exclusion of
any single study at one time from the meta-analysis or exclu-
sion of trials that included participants with a history of breast
cancer yielded results that were not substantially different. For
18 trials assessing the association of phytoestrogen supple-
mentation with daily hot flashes, the mean differences ranged
from −0.90 (95% CI, −1.44 to −0.37) to −1.43 (95% CI, −2.15 to
−0.71) on exclusion of any single study at one time (eFigure 4
in the Supplement). The combined mean difference on ex-
cluding studies with participants with a history of breast can-
cer was −2.50 (95% CI, −3.07 to −1.93) (eFigure 5 in the Supple-
ment). For 7 trials assessing the influence of red clover
supplementation on daily hot flashes, the mean differences
ranged from −0.75 (95% CI, −1.95 to 0.45) to −2.28 (95% CI,
−4.61 to 0.06) when any single study was individually ex-
cluded (eFigure 6 in the Supplement).
Six RCTs showed high risk of bias in 1 domain, 10 in 2
domains, and 14 in 3 domains; the remaining RCTs showed
high risk of bias in 4 or more domains (eTable 8 in the
Supplement). However, most of the RCTs (n = 60) could not
be clearly classified in 1 or more domains (eTable 8 in the
Supplement). Seven of 12 analyses showed high between-
study heterogeneity, with an I2 estimate exceeding 75%
(P < .01 for the Cochrane χ2 statistic) (Figure 2 and Figure 3;
eFigures 1, 2, and 3 in the Supplement). This level of hetero-
geneity could be explained by differences between studies
attributable to heterogeneous study populations, methods,
and effect estimates (eTable 8 in the Supplement).
Furthermore, for trials assessing the influence of phy-
toestrogen supplementation on the number of daily hot
flashes, the identified heterogeneity was largely explained
by the level of risk of bias (Table 2). The stratified analysis
by the level of risk of bias showed that the association was
stronger for studies that were classified with high risk of
bias in 3 or more domains (Table 2). For trials examining the
association between red clover supplementation and the
number of hot flashes in 24 hours, heterogeneity was not
explained by any of the study-level characteristics assessed
(Table 2). Owing to a limited number of studies in the other
meta-analysis, it was not possible to identify the factors
contributing to the observed heterogeneity. Publication bias
was assessed visually using Begg funnel plots for meta-
analyses that included 5 or more studies. On examination,
the plot was approximately symmetrical for the meta-
analysis of phytoestrogen and number of hot flashes within
24 hours as well as for the meta-analysis of dietary and
supplemental soy isoflavones and number of daily hot
flashes (eFigure 7 in the Supplement). The plot for the
analysis of the association of red clover with number of hot
flashes within 24 hours was asymmetrical (eFigure 7 in the
Supplement). The Egger test estimates were nonsignificant
(P > .05) for all analyses that involved a minimum of 5 stud-
ies (eFigure 7 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, some plant-
based therapies were associated with modest reductions in
the frequency of menopausal symptoms in women. Compos-
ite phytoestrogen supplementation and individual phytoes-
trogen interventions, such as dietary and supplemental soy
isoflavones, were associated with improvement in some
menopausal symptoms, including modest reductions in hot
flashes and vaginal dryness but no significant reduction in
night sweats. Additionally, several medicinal herbs were
associated with improved menopausal symptoms. There was
substantial diversity among the available studies in scientific
rigor and quality.
Composite phytoestrogen supplementation was associ-
ated with improved menopausal symptoms. Our findings
are further supported by other RCTs showing a beneficial
association of phytoestrogen supplementation with the
Kupperman Index, a scale commonly used in clinical prac-
tice to assess the severity of menopausal symptoms.24,84,85
Our sensitivity analyses differentiating the association
between overall phytoestrogen use and menopausal symp-
toms by type of phytoestrogen intervention (eg, whole
foods, soy protein, and isoflavone extract supplementation
groups) yielded broadly similar results. Supplementing with
red clover, a rich source of phytoestrogens formononetin,
biochanin A, daidzein, and genistein,86 was associated with
improvements in night sweats but not with the frequency of
hot flashes.
There may be a plausible biological argument for these as-
sociations of phytoestrogens with improved symptoms. The
2 major subtypes of phytoestrogen, isoflavones and lignans,
have a chemical structure similar to that of estradiol (ie, a form
of estrogen) and therefore also appear to have estrogen-like
properties. However, this mechanism of action also could
be associated with adverse effects such as endometrial
hyperplasia.87
There was no significant association between black co-
hosh (Cimicifuga racemosa or Actaea racemosa) supplemen-
tation and menopausal symptoms. Also, RCTs examining the
association of black cohosh with menopausal scores, such as
theKuppermanIndex,haveshownnobeneficialassociation.88

Although black cohosh remains a widely studied and popular
herbal remedy, there has been lack of clarity regarding the
identity of its active compounds and its mechanisms of ac-
tion, as well as concerns about possible adverse effects.89
Beyond these existing uncertainties, the lack of beneficial re-
sults in the current meta-analysis does not support the use of
blackcohoshtoreducemenopausalsymptoms.Also,ouranaly-
ses involving trials of medicinal herbal remedies showed no
overall association of Chinese medicinal herbs such as dong
quai on menopausal symptoms. By contrast, trials that as-
sessed newer herbal remedies such as ERr 731 (an extract iso-
lated from Rheum rhaponticum), and pycnogenol (extract from
pine bark), reported associations with improvements in the
number of hot flashes in 24 hours. However, more trials are

needed to determine the efficacy of these products on meno-
pausal symptoms, because the evidence remains limited.
This study has a number of limitations. First, it is pos-
sible that both measured and unmeasured publication bias can
limit our overall findings. In this regard, although evalua-
tions with the conventional funnel plots and Egger test esti-
mates indicate minimal publication bias, these approaches are
limited by a qualitative assessment reliant on visual inspec-
tion and the fact that the majority of these assessments were
based on a limited number of studies (between 5 and 10). We
cannot exclude the possibility of publication bias from under-
reporting of negative findings. Second, the quality of in-
cluded studies was limited. Variation in study quality contrib-
uted to the heterogeneity of findings noted in several of the
meta-analyses presented in our study. Other sources of hetero-
geneity are likely to include population differences, includ-
ing ethnicity—a factor in the presence of menopausal
symptoms90,91—and differing age ranges. Furthermore, the
supplements used in the trials may vary in quality and com-
position (ie, how much of the active ingredient is actually pro-
vided by the supplement), which might have contributed to
the heterogeneity in effects observed in our analyses. Third,
the number of available studies in some analyses was small,
precluding our ability to quantitatively investigate the sources
of the observed heterogeneity. Varying degrees of outcome
measures may have contributed to heterogeneity. Fourth, self-
reported measures of vasomotor symptoms may be subject to
memory and reporting bias. Future studies should assess va-
somotor symptoms physiologically using, for example, an am-
bulatoryhotflashmonitortomeasureskinconductance.Given
these limitations, the results of this systematic review and
meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution.
This review may have several implications. First, the find-
ings reinforce that a number of plant-based therapies may be
associated with improvements in both individual and collec-
tive menopausal symptoms. Second, findings underscore ma-
jor research and knowledge gaps, both in potentially benefi-
cialtherapiesandinoutcomesassessed.Forinstance,although
themajorityoftheavailablestudiesfocusonhotflashes,which
are the most common symptom of the menopausal transi-
tion, a few studies evaluated other menopausal symptoms (eg,
night sweats). There were insufficient numbers of studies as-
sessingherbalremedies.Third,thisreviewunderscoresthelack
of data on adverse effects associated with long-term use of
plant-based therapies. Information on any detrimental health
effects, typically available in long-term intervention studies,
is essential, given their potential relevance to postmeno-
pausal health.
Conclusions
Thismeta-analysisofclinicaltrialssuggeststhatcompositeand
specificphytoestrogensupplementationswereassociatedwith
modest reductions in the frequency of hot flashes and vagi-
nal dryness but no significant reduction in night sweats. How-
ever, because of general suboptimal quality and the hetero-
geneous nature of the current evidence, further rigorous
studies are needed to determine the association of plant-
based and natural therapies with menopausal health.
