Abstract
Objective
Our objective was to test the primary hypothesis that maternal non-left, in particular supine
going-to-sleep position, would be a risk factor for late stillbirth (�28 weeks of gestation).
Methods
A multicentre case-control study was conducted in seven New Zealand health regions,
between February 2012 and December 2015.
Cases (n = 164) were women with singleton pregnancies and late stillbirth, without con-
genital abnormality. Controls (n = 569) were women with on-going singleton pregnancies,
randomly selected and frequency matched for health region and gestation.
The primary outcome was adjusted odds of late stillbirth associated with self-reported
going-to-sleep position, on the last night. The last night was the night before the late stillbirth
was thought to have occurred or the night before interview for controls. Going-to-sleep posi-
tion on the last night was categorised as: supine, left-side, right-side, propped or restless.
Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for known confounders.
Results
Supine going-to-sleep position on the last night was associated with increased late stillbirth
risk (adjusted odds ratios (aOR) 3.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.74 to 7.78) with a pop-
ulation attributable risk of 9.4%. Other independent risk factors for late stillbirth (aOR, 95%
CI) were: BMI (1.04, 1.01 to 1.08) per unit, maternal age �40 (2.88, 1.31 to 6.32), birth-
weight <10th customised centile (2.76, 1.59 to 4.80), and <6 hours sleep on the last night
(1.81, 1.14 to 2.88). The risk associated with supine-going-to-sleep position was greater for
term (aOR 10.26, 3.00 to 35.04) than preterm stillbirths (aOR 3.12, 0.97 to 10.05).

 Conclusions
Supine going-to-sleep position is associated with a 3.7 fold increase in overall late stillbirth
risk, independent of other common risk factors. A public health campaign encouraging
women not to go-to-sleep supine in the third trimester has potential to reduce late stillbirth
by approximately 9%.
Introduction
Stillbirth remains one of few potentially avoidable maternal and child health problems and is
now approximately twice as common as neonatal death [1, 2]. The 2016 Lancet “Ending Pre-
ventable Stillbirth Series” highlighted differences in rates of late stillbirth (at �28 weeks’)
between high-income countries ranging from #1.3/1000 to 8.8/1000 births [2]. Disparities also
exist between ethnic groups within high-income countries [1, 3]. Such variations suggest it
should be possible to further reduce late stillbirth rates in many settings. Accordingly there is
an urgent need to identify simple and cost effective preventative interventions for stillbirth [4].
Furthermore at least 30% of late stillbirths are currently classified as unexplained [1, 2].
Although a number of studies have examined risk factors for stillbirth, many have only been
able to use routinely collected data [5, 6] or have been systematic reviews [7] and therefore
have been unable to explore detailed relationships with maternal lifestyle and personal habits.
Approximately one third of life is spent asleep, and until recently there has been little
research on the impact of maternal sleep practices on the fetus. Our Auckland Stillbirth Study
was the first to report an association between going-to-sleep position and late stillbirth risk,
with mothers who did not settle to sleep on their left side, the night before the baby was sus-
pected to have died, having a two-fold increase in risk [8]. The highest risk, among non-left
sided sleepers, occurred in women who went to sleep supine aOR 2.54, 95% CI (1.04 to 6.18).
The relationship between supine going-to-sleep position and late stillbirth is biologically plau-
sible as supine position in late pregnancy is associated with pathophysiological effects with
potential to compromise fetal wellbeing. These include reduced: maternal cardiac output [9],
uterine blood flow [10], and pulsatility index in the fetal middle cerebral artery (a surrogate
for fetal hypoxia) [11]. Supine sleep position is also associated with sleep disturbed breathing
and obstructive sleep apnea, which have each been associated with pregnancy complications
[12, 13].
In the Auckland Stillbirth Study we also found that women who regularly slept during the
day (aOR 2.04, 95% CI (1.26 to 3.30) and those with long (>8 hours) night time sleep duration
(aOR 1.71, 95% CI (0.99 to 2.95) also had an increased risk of late stillbirth. However, it is not
clear whether these associations are causal or incidental.
We now report results from the New Zealand multicentre stillbirth study in which we tested
the primary hypothesis that non-left, and specifically supine going-to-sleep position, would be
associated with increased risk of late stillbirth. In addition we also tested the hypothesis that
increased sleep duration and sleeping during the day would be associated with increased late
stillbirth risk.

 Study design and population
This multicentre case-control study was conducted in seven of twenty New Zealand health
regions (District Health Boards, DHB). Criteria for choosing these regions, was that they had
the largest numbers of late stillbirths in New Zealand between 2007 and 2010 [14]. Two thirds
of all New Zealand births occur in these seven health regions (Waitemata, Auckland, Counties
Manukau, Waikato, MidCentral, Capital & Coast, and Canterbury). Recruitment occurred
between February 2012 and December 2015. Ethical approval was obtained from the Northern
“X” Regional Ethics Committee: NTX/06/05/054.
Women with multiple pregnancies and babies identified with major congenital abnormali-
ties at any stage of the study were excluded. Cases were consenting women with a stillbirth at
�28 weeks of gestation. We obtained the distribution of stillbirths by health region and gesta-
tion using New Zealand stillbirth data over a three-year period (2007–9) [15]. Controls were
women with ongoing pregnancies randomly selected with frequency matching to a projected
distribution of stillbirths, ensuring that controls would be at a similar gestation to cases in each
participating health region. We planned to select two controls for each estimated eligible case
in each health region.
Procedures and variables
Eligible subjects were given a brief description of the study by their midwife or doctor and asked
whether the research midwife could contact them to explain the study and invite them to par-
ticipate. If the woman agreed, a time and place for interview was arranged and written consent
was obtained. Eligible participants were informed that the broad aim of the study was to iden-
tify modifiable risk factors for late stillbirth and specific hypotheses were not discussed. If the
woman did not consent, age, ethnicity and parity were collected without identifiable informa-
tion. Interpreters were organised for women who had difficulty reading or speaking in English.
Data were obtained by structured face-to-face interview (S1 Appendix) conducted by
research midwives employed part-time in each recruitment centre and from medical records.
For cases the interview occurred as soon after stillbirth as possible and for controls, as close
to the allocated gestation as possible. Data collected in the interview included: demographic,
lifestyle, general health and antenatal care details and information about a range of sleep prac-
tices [14]. Data about sleep practices were collected at the end of the interview. Height was
measured by the research midwife and body mass index calculated using the earliest weight
recorded in pregnancy. A single prioritized maternal ethnicity was determined as recom-
mended by the New Zealand Ministry of Health [16]. Social deprivation was derived from the
address where the participant lived during pregnancy, with category one least deprived and
category five most deprived [17].
The primary outcome was the odds of late stillbirth associated with maternal self-reported
going-to-sleep position, on the last night. The last night was the night before late stillbirth was
thought to have occurred or the night before interview for controls. Information about usual
going-to-sleep position in the last week was also collected. Going-to-sleep position on the last
night was classified as: left side, right side, restless, supine (lying on the back), on the front, or
propped. Restless going-to-sleep referred to women who reported that they had changed posi-
tion frequently when settling to sleep and could not recall the position they finally fell asleep
in. In women who did not remember any details of their going-to-sleep position, the position
was recorded as unknown. Usual going-to-sleep position in the last week was classified as: left
side, right side, variable side, supine (lying on the back), on the front or propped. To assist the
participant to recall her going-to-sleep position the woman was asked to visualise herself lying
in bed.

 Participants were also asked if they got up at night to the toilet and how many hours they
thought they had slept at night on the last night. Sleep duration was categorised as: <6 hours; 6
to 8 hours; and >8 hours, as per our previous study [8]. The frequency of sleeping during the
daytime in the last week was also recorded.
Customised birthweight centiles, that adjust for maternal characteristics (height, early preg-
nancy weight, ethnicity and parity) as well as gestation at delivery and infant sex, were calcu-
lated for all infants [18]. The gestation used to calculate the centile for cases was the day the
mother thought the baby had died and for controls the gestation at birth. Small for gestational
age (SGA) was defined as birthweight <10th customised centile [18].
All stillbirths were classified using the Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand
Classification system [19]. Deaths classified as due to fetal growth restriction require either
antenatal diagnosis of fetal growth restriction with abnormal Doppler studies and or specified
placental pathology. If growth restriction was not identified before birth, late stillbirths with a
customised birthweight centile <10th are typically classified as unexplained [19].
Statistical analysis
We estimated that over a three year recruitment period there would be 415 eligible cases, 291
of whom would participate [15], based on 70% recruitment in The Auckland Stillbirth Study
[8], and 830 eligible controls (estimated 582 participants). Given this sample size, a significance
level of 0.05, power of 0.8 and prevalence of a risk factor in controls of between 30% and 60%
(prevalence of non-left sleep position in The Auckland Stillbirth Study was 57%) we could
detect an odds ratio (OR) of 1.50. With a 5% prevalence of a risk factor (supine sleep position
in The Auckland Stillbirth Study controls) we could detect an OR of 2.2.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.6 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC
USA). Generalized additive models were fitted to explore the relationship between continuous
variables (maternal age, BMI, birthweight centile) and stillbirth, and determine whether vari-
ables should be analysed continuously or categorically.
Differences between categorical variables were tested by chi-square tests. Continuous vari-
ables were compared using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests. Univariable analysis was performed
to evaluate the association between sleep practices and late stillbirth risk. A multivariable
model was developed incorporating ethnicity and deprivation index, variables associated with
increased risk of stillbirth based on previous literature (age, BMI, parity, smoking, SGA status),
other sleep variables significant in univariable analysis, and variables used to select cases and
controls (gestation and DHB). Unconditional logistic regression was used to adjust for poten-
tial confounders. No imputation was performed for missing data. Women who could not recall
their going-to-sleep position on the last night (unknown going-to- sleep position) were ex-
cluded from the multivariable model. We also carried out a stratified analysis by term (�37
weeks’) and preterm (�28 to 36 weeks’) gestation. The c statistic has been calculated to assess
model performance.
Statistical significance was defined at the 5% level. OR and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with
95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to estimate risk. Population Attributable Risk (PAR)
was calculated using unadjusted OR for the primary outcome, supine sleep position, and other
potentially modifiable risk factors that remained significant in multivariable analysis [20].
Results
During recruitment there was a 40% national reduction in late stillbirths, compared with esti-
mated numbers based on data from 2007–9 [15]. Fewer cases were therefore recruited, 164 vs
291 projected, whereas numbers of controls were similar to projected, 569 vs 582. The final

 ratio of cases to controls was thus 1: 3.5. The rate of recruitment was 65.9% for cases and
62.2% for controls (Table 1) and recruitment for cases and controls occurred contemporane-
ously throughout the study.
Baseline demographic characteristics were compared between eligible non-participants and
recruited participants (Table 1). Women of high parity were underrepresented in cases and
controls. Indian women were over-represented and Māori under-represented in participating
compared with eligible controls. To further check representativeness of the recruited popula-
tion, we compared the univariable odds for late stillbirth for age, ethnicity and parity, from
the eligible cases and controls (participants and non-participants) with the odds ratios from
recruited cases and controls, and there were no significant differences (results not shown).
Classification of most likely cause of late stillbirth [19] demonstrated that 38.4% of all still-
births and 44.8% of stillbirths after 37 weeks’ were unexplained (Table 2).
Median (interquartile range, IQR) gestation at the estimated time of late stillbirth was 37.7
(34.1 to 39.9) weeks’ and at interview for controls was 37.4 (34.0 to 38.9) weeks’ (p = 0.003)
and 97 (58.5%) of stillbirths occurred at �37 weeks’. The median (IQR) time to interview after
the estimated date of stillbirth was 24 (16 to 32) days. Pregnancy weight was measured before
20 weeks of gestation in 91% of women and a linear relationship between increasing BMI and
late stillbirth risk was demonstrated (Fig 1).
On the last night, there was an increase in late stillbirth risk in univariable analysis in
women who went to sleep supine (OR 3.63, 95% CI 1.87 to 7.04) and in those who reported
they were restless going-to-sleep (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.31 to 5.47) (Table 3). On the last night
before late stillbirth there was also a borderline increase in risk with non-left going-to-sleep
positions (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.02) (Table 3).
Risk factors for late stillbirth significant in multivariable analysis were: supine going-to-
sleep position on the last night (aOR 3.67, 95% CI 1.74 to 7.78), <6 hours sleep on the last
night (aOR 1.81, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.88, maternal age �40 (aOR 2.88, 95% CI 1.31 to 6.32), BMI

 (aOR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.08, that is a 4% increase in risk for every unit increase in BMI),
and SGA (aOR 2.76, 95% CI 1.59 to 4.80) (Table 3). The area under the ROC curve for the
model was 0.736. Using non-left versus left in the multivariable model resulted in non-signifi-
cant increase in late stillbirth risk compared with the combined non-left positions (aOR 1.35,
95% CI 0.92 to 1.99).
Among participants who reported going-to-sleep supine on the last night, 70.7% reported
that their usual going-to-sleep position in the last week was also supine. Accordingly women
with late stillbirth were also more likely to go to sleep supine in the last week (aOR 3.46, 95%
CI 1.49 to 8.03) but risk was not increased with the combined non-left going-to-sleep positions
in the last week (aOR1.04, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.48) (Table 3).
The population attributable risk for potentially modifiable risk factors associated with late
stillbirth in our model were calculated (Table 4), with PAR for supine going-to-sleep position
on the last night (9.4%) similar to risk with maternal overweight (8.4%).
We further explored the risk associated with supine going-to-sleep position on the last
night and during the last week in term (�37 weeks’ gestation) and preterm (�28 to 36 weeks’
gestation) cases and controls. The risk was greater for term (aOR 10.26, 3.00–35.04) than pre-
term stillbirths (aOR 3.12, 0.97–10.05) for the last night and also the last week (aOR 12.73
(2.92 to 55.46) vs aOR 2.25 (0.65 to 7.84) (Table 5).
Discussion
In this New Zealand multicentre case-control study, women in the third trimester of preg-
nancy who went to sleep supine the night before the baby was thought to have died, had an
overall 3.7 fold increased risk of late stillbirth with a population attributable risk of 9.4%. This
risk was independent of other common risk factors for late stillbirth such as obesity, smoking,
advanced maternal age, and SGA. The consistent findings from two New Zealand case-control
studies [8] with very similar methodology, an Australian and Ghanaian study [21, 22], as well
as the biological plausability, suggest that the relationship between supine going-to-sleep posi-
tion and late stillbirth is likely to be causal with applicability in both Western and non-Western
settings. In addition a novel feature of our study is the finding that the risk associated with
supine-going-to-sleep position is higher in term pregnancies compared with those between 28
and 36 weeks’ which may have implications for public health messages.

 Biological plausibility of findings
Reduced vena-caval diameter has been demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging in
supine compared with the left lateral position in late pregnancy [23]. Another study, using
Doppler ultrasound, showed that blood flow in the uterine artery was less in the supine posi-
tion than in the left lateral [10]. Adverse fetal effects of the supine position are suggested by
reduced middle cerebral artery Doppler resistance, a fetal response to hypoxia [11], and
reduced fetal oxygen saturation in labour in the supine position [24]. Furthermore we have
recently reported that in healthy late pregnancy, when the mother is in the supine position, the
fetus spends more time in behavioural state 1 (fetal quiescence) and less time in active fetal
behavioral state 4, compared to when the mother is on her left side [25]. This provides addi-
tional evidence to support a relatively hypoxic environment for the fetus when a healthy
mother is in the supine position in late pregnancy.
Supine position is also associated with sleep disturbed breathing, which increases in
pregnancy, and has been associated with pregnancy complications including hypertensive dis-
orders, gestational diabetes and fetal growth restriction [26]. Hence there are multiple mecha-
nisms which could mediate the effects of supine position in late pregnancy on fetal wellbeing.
Comparison with other studies
Compared with controls in the Auckland Stillbirth Study [8], there has been an increase in left
sided going-to-sleep position (43% versus 57.6%) and a small decrease in supine going-to-
sleep position (5% versus 3.8%) in the current study, which demonstrates that going-to-sleep
position is modifiable. In addition we have recently completed a survey of sleep practices in
late pregnancy in a multi-ethnic community with high perinatal mortality [27]. A large major-
ity of women surveyed (227/263, 86%) who reported they did not currently go-to-sleep on

 their left side responded that they could change to going-to-sleep on their left side if this was
better for their baby [27].
In the current study, the risk of late stillbirth was not elevated in women who reported
going-to-sleep on their right on the last night and the last week; whereas in our previous study
there was a borderline increase in risk with right sided compared with left sided going-to-sleep
position on the last night [8]. Further evidence is required to confirm whether right sided
going-to-sleep position is associated with similar risk of late stillbirth to left sided going-to-
sleep position.
Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not demonstrate an association between sleeping during
the day or long night-time sleep duration and late stillbirth risk. We did demonstrate an asso-
ciation between short sleep duration on the last night and late stillbirth risk (aOR 1.81, 95% CI

for this association is that women with short sleep duration may have been experiencing dis-

 obesity (20.4%). The large majority of SGA stillborn infants are not currently recognised as
SGA before birth [28]. Programmes that hold promise for reducing mortality in SGA pregnan-
cies, such as the UK based Growth Assessment Protocol [29], require further evaluation. Con-
sistent with a recent study [30], we demonstrated a dose dependent association between
increasing BMI and stillbirth risk. Multiple mechanisms are likely responsible for the associa-
tion between obesity and stillbirth [31]. Our findings again highlight the importance of enter-
ing pregnancy with a normal BMI to optimise the likelihood of a healthy pregnancy.
Strengths and limitations of study
A case-control study is the most appropriate study design to address our hypothesis. As late
stillbirth is relatively rare (3/1000 births), a prospective cohort study design is not feasible or
affordable. Such a design would involve recruitment of hundreds of thousands of women with
regular completion of questionnaires about sleep practices and other lifestyle factors.
In any case-control study there is potential for recall bias. This was reduced by using a struc-
tured interview and ensuring that participants and research midwives were not informed of spe-
cific study hypotheses. Information about going-to-sleep position was by necessity collected by
self-report. The reliability of self-reported sleep position has been questioned [32], however, our
group has recently demonstrated that there is good correlation between maternal short term
recall of going-to-sleep position and going-to-sleep position recorded by video technology [33].
The median time to interview in women with late stillbirth was 24 days. This is unlikely to
have resulted in recall bias which is a systematic difference between cases and controls in the
accuracy of recalled information. The time lapse could influence the accuracy of recalled infor-
mation but this would not be biased towards the exposure.
Maternal report was also used to estimate the timing of fetal death, with potential that in
some cases the ‘last night’ was not the night before fetal death, or the night during which the
baby died. However, a similar risk of late stillbirth was seen for women who reported they usu-
ally went to sleep supine in the last week (aOR 3.46, 95% CI 1.49 to 8.03) as for the last night.
Furthermore 70.7% of women who reported going-to-sleep supine on the last night also
reported usually going-to-sleep supine in the last week. This suggests that self-report of ‘last
night’ is likely to be reliable and adopting a supine going-to-sleep position on the last night is
not a response to the baby’s death.
During recruitment there was a reduction in late stillbirths after 37 weeks of gestation in
New Zealand resulting in fewer cases recruited compared with projected numbers. With this
decrease in late stillbirth we were underpowered to investigate interactions between going-to-
sleep position and measures of fetal vulnerability such as small for gestational age infants and
maternal obesity and smoke exposure [34]. We used very similar study design and question-
naires as The Auckland Stillbirth Study [8] and the Midlands and North of England Stillbirth
Study [35] and are therefore planning an individual participant data meta-analysis to investi-
gate these interactions and also to determine whether right sided going-to-sleep position is
associated with increased risk (PROSPERO registration: CRD42017047703).
Controls in our study were selected from the pregnant population at similar gestation to the
stillbirths, allowing comparison of maternal lifestyle at similar gestational age. The participants
were also broadly representative of the eligible population and our results are likely to be gen-
eralisable to other similar populations.
Conclusions
Supine going-to-sleep position is a modifiable risk factor for late stillbirth. Reductions in non-
left and supine going-to-sleep position over time in New Zealand suggest that women are able

 to modify their going-to-sleep position in response to advice. Although there has been no for-
mal public health campaign in New Zealand, it is likely that midwives, obstetricians and child-
birth educators are advising pregnant women to go to sleep on their left side. Public health
education should be developed recommending that women in the third trimester do not settle
to sleep supine, especially after 37 weeks’.
In conclusion, women in the third trimester of pregnancy who went to sleep supine the
night before their baby died, had a 3.7 fold overall increased risk of late stillbirth that was inde-
pendent of other common risk factors. These findings confirm those in our original hypothesis
generating study and are biologically plausible, suggesting that the relationship may be causal.
Successful public health interventions advising that women do not go to sleep supine in late
pregnancy have potential to reduce late stillbirth by approximately 9% overall.
