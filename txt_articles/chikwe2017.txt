ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Degenerative mitral valve repair rates remain highly variable, despite established benefits of repair
over replacement. The contribution of surgeon-specific factors is poorly defined.
OBJECTIVES This study evaluated the influence of surgeon case volume on degenerative mitral valve repair rates and
outcomes.
METHODS A mandatory New York State database was queried and 5,475 patients were identified with degenerative mitral
disease who underwent mitral valve operations between 2002 and 2013. Mitral repair rates, mitral reoperations within
12 months of repair, and survival were analyzed using multivariable Cox modeling and restricted cubic spline function.
RESULTS Median annual surgeon volume of any mitral operations was 10 (range 1 to 230), with a mean repair rate of 55%
(n ¼ 20,797 of 38,128). In the subgroup of patients with degenerative disease, the mean repair rate was 67% (n ¼ 3,660 of
5,475), with a range of 0% to 100%. Mean repair rates ranged from 48% (n ¼ 179 of 370) for surgeons with total annual
volumes of #10 mitral operations to 77% (n ¼ 1,710 of 2,216) for surgeons with total annual volumes of >50 mitral operations
(p < 0.001). Higher total annual surgeon volume was associated with increased repair rates of degenerative mitral valve
disease (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.13 for every additional 10 mitral operations; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10 to 1.17;
p < 0.001); a steady decrease in reoperation risk until 25 total mitral operations annually; and improved 1-year survival
(adjusted hazard ratio: 0.95 for every additional 10 operations; 95% CI: 0.92 to 0.98; p ¼ 0.001). For surgeons with a total
annual volume of #25 mitral operations, repair rates were higher (63.8%; n ¼ 180 of 282) if they operated in the same
institution asa surgeon with total annualmitral volumes of >50and degenerative mitralvalve repair rates of >70%, compared
withsurgeonsoperatinginthe otherinstitutions (51.3%;n ¼ 580of 1,130) (adjusted OR: 1.79;95% CI:1.24 to2.60;p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that individual surgeon volume is a determinant of not only mitral repair rates, but
also freedom from reoperation, and survival. The data from this study support the guideline’s concept of reference referral to
experienced mitral surgeons to improve outcomes in patients with degenerative mitral valve disease. (J Am Coll Cardiol

strongly recommend valve repair whenever possible,
and they also emphasize the importance of a durable

 on an asymptomatic patient (1,2). Mitral valve
replacement unfortunately remains relatively
common in patients with degenerative valve
disease, and studies have highlighted wide
variation in mitral surgical volume and repair
rates
when
looking
at
“all-comer”
study
groups (3–10). The influence of mitral surgical
volume on perioperative mortality and repair
rates is becoming established, but less is
known regarding the impact of volume on 1-year sur-
vival and the need for early reoperation. Most large
database reports have also included a broad range of
causes of mitral valve disease.
To understand the effect of case volume on clinical
outcomes in patients likely to have isolated degen-
erative disease more clearly, we analyzed a cohort
drawn from all patients undergoing mitral valve
operations in New York State. We sought to deter-
mine the effect of surgeon-specific factors on repair
rates, survival, and long-term freedom from repeat
mitral valve surgery.
METHODS
PATIENTS. This study was an analysis of adult pa-
tients, 18 years of age or older, who underwent pri-
mary mitral valve operations in New York State
between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2013. Pa-
tients were identified using the Statewide Planning
and
Research
Cooperative
System,
an
all-payer,
administrative database that prospectively collects
data on every hospital discharge, ambulatory surgery,
and emergency department visit in New York State,
with longitudinal data available from 1995 to 2014.
We reviewed all available pre-operative patient data
to
identify
patients’
baseline
characteristics
and
followed up patients for at least 12 months post-
operatively.
Patients
undergoing
mitral
valve
replacement were identified using the International
Classification
of
Diseases-Ninth
Revision-Clinical
Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedure codes 35.23 and
35.24; patients undergoing mitral valve repair were
identified using ICD-9-CM codes 35.12 and 35.33.
Through exclusion of other causes, we identified a
subgroup of patients with presumed degenerative
mitral valve disease. Exclusion criteria were other
possible mitral valve causes, including any history of
coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, rheu-
matic valve disease, infective endocarditis, congen-
ital heart disease, and cardiomyopathy. Patients who
underwent concomitant surgery on the aortic valve,
pulmonary
valve,
coronary
arteries,
or
the
left
ventricle and patients with prior replacement or
repair of any valve, prior coronary revascularization,
prior heart transplantation, and prior ventricular
assist device placement were also excluded. Addi-
tionally, we excluded patients with out-of-state resi-
dency
to
ensure
complete
follow-up
using
the
Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative Sys-
tem. Patients who did not have identifiable surgeons
were also excluded (Online Figure 1, Online Table 1
[ICD-9-CM
codes]).
Baseline
comorbidities
were
identified
using
present-on-admission
diagnosis
codes from the index hospitalization and all di-
agnoses from hospitalizations before the index hos-
pitalization (Online Table 2). We compared repair
rates, long-term survival, and risk of post-repair
reoperation in the subgroup of patients with degen-
erative disease according to total annual surgeon
volume, which was defined as any mitral valve
operation for any cause during the study period (see
definitions). This study was approved by the Data
Protection Review Board of the New York State
Department of Health, as well as by the Program for
Protection of Human Subjects at the Icahn School of
Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. The
approval included a waiver of informed consent.
DEFINITIONS. Total annual surgeon volume for the
surgeon
who
performed
the
operation
on
each
patient was calculated as the number of mitral valve
operations for any causes (repair or replacement)
performed by the patient’s operating surgeon in the
365 days immediately before surgery, to reflect the
recent experience of each surgeon at the time of
surgery.
Next,
the
experience
of
each
surgeon
across the entire study period was quantified as
mean total annual surgeon volume. Degenerative
mitral
valve
repair
rate
was
calculated
as
the
number of repairs divided by the total number of
operations for degenerative mitral valve disease a
surgeon
performed.
Surgeons
were
considered
eligible for the study when they practiced for at
least 365 days.
STUDY
ENDPOINTS. The
study
endpoints
were
all-cause mortality, degenerative repair rates, and
post-repair mitral valve reoperation. Reoperation was
defined
as
any
mitral
valve
operation,
either
replacement or repair, on subsequent admissions.
Patients
with
no
documented
reoperation
were
censored on December 31, 2014. Deaths were identi-
fied using the full national Social Security Death
Master File (current as of May 29, 2015) and by
searching all hospital admissions and ambulatory or
emergency department visits for patients’ deaths. For
1-year mortality and reoperation, time to events was

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Continuous variables were
reported as means with SDs. Categorical variables
were expressed as proportions. Differences in base-
line characteristics and comorbidities among patients
treated by surgeons with different volumes were
assessed using analysis of variance for normally
distributed
continuous
variables
and
Pearson’s
chi-square test for categorical variables. To describe
the difference in patients’ baseline demographics and
comorbidities
according
to
total
annual
surgeon
volume,
4
groups
with
arbitrary
cutoffs
were
created: #10; 11 to 24; 25 to 50; and $51 mitral valve
procedures/year.
Survival after mitral valve repair or replacement
and post-repair reoperation were assessed by fitting
multivariable Cox proportional hazard models with a
robust sandwich variance estimator to control for
clustering
of
patients
operated
on
by
the
same
surgeons
and
adjusting
for
covariates
and
total
annual surgeon volume treated as a continuous var-
iable.
Baseline
characteristics
(age,
sex,
race
or
ethnicity, type of admission, year of mitral surgery,
hypertension, diabetes, peripheral vascular diseases,
cerebrovascular disease, chronic heart failure, atrial
fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
chronic kidney disease, liver disease, malignant dis-
ease, coagulation, platelet disorders, and pulmonary
hypertension) were included in the model as cova-
riates. For the primary endpoint analysis of survival,
a separate model with procedure type (repair or
replacement) was also created. This model included
the baseline covariates listed in the preceding text
and procedure type. The probability of mitral valve
repair was assessed by fitting multivariable logistic
regression
models
with
generalized
estimating
equations to control for clustering of patients oper-
ated on by the same surgeons, where repair proced-
ure
was
a
dependent
variable
and

baseline
characteristics
listed
earlier
were

 independent variables. Risk-adjusted probabilities of
mitral valve repair with corresponding 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs)
were
plotted at each total
annual surgeon volume.
Total annual surgeon volume was first included
into each model as a continuous variable, and the
linear association between volume and each outcome
was tested using restricted cubic spline functions
with 3 knots at total annual surgeon volumes of 10,
25, and 50 operations/year (11,12). Linearity was
assessed by linear hypothesis testing, and Akaike in-
formation criteria were used for the best model se-
lection. The volume association with outcomes was
shown either as an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for
survival and reoperations or as an adjusted odds ratio
(OR) with its 95% CI for assessing probability of
repair. The association between total annual surgeon
volume and post-repair reoperation was nonlinear.
By using a multivariable Cox regression model with
restricted cubic spline function, the HR of reoperation
within 1 year after repair was plotted against total
annual surgeon volume (11). The observed change
point of the slope of the HR curve was used as a cutoff
value. The same Cox regression model, with surgeon
volume as a categorical variable, was created, and the
adjusted HR by 2 groups was reported. The associa-
tion between total annual surgeon volume and sur-
vival or probability of repair was linear: adjusted HR
for survival and adjusted OR for repair were calcu-
lated by 10-case volume increments and also by the
arbitrary cutoffs defined earlier. Cumulative inci-
dence function curves of post-repair reoperation were
constructed using risk competing analysis. The pro-
portional hazards assumption was valid in all Cox
models. All tests were 2-tailed, and an alpha level of
0.05 was considered statistically significant. All sta-
tistical analyses were performed using SAS software
version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
STUDY POPULATION. A total of 5,475 adults with
degenerative mitral valve disease, 18 years of age or
older, who underwent primary mitral valve opera-
tions performed by cardiac surgeons in New York
State from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2013, were
identified: 3,660 (66.8%) patients underwent mitral
valve repair, and 1,815 patients (33.2%) underwent
mitral valve replacement. Median follow-up time was
6.8 years (range 0 to 13.4 years).

 A total of 313 surgeons from 41 institutions met the
study eligibility criteria. Surgeons in New York State
performed a median of 10 mitral valve operations/
year (range 1 to 230). The repair rate for primary
mitral valve procedures for any causes was 55%
(n ¼ 20,797 of 38,128); the median annual institu-
tional mitral valve volume was 59 mitral valve oper-
ations, ranging from a minimum of 6 to a maximum of
310 operations. Repair rates for primary mitral valve
operations for any cause at all 41 institutions varied
from 15% to 83%, and repair rates for degenerative
mitral valve operations varied from 25% to 100%
(Figure 1). Of 313 surgeons, 231 operated on at least 1
patient in the cohort with degenerative disease who
was included in further analysis.
In the cohort of 5,475 patients with degenerative
disease,
surgeons
with
a

volume <25 operations carried out 25% of operations
(n ¼ 1,412). These patients were significantly more
likely to present as urgent admissions (27% vs. 16%;
p < 0.001), and they were more likely to have major
comorbidities, such as congestive heart failure (43%
vs. 27%; p < 0.001), chronic kidney disease (7% vs. 2%;
p < 0.001), or chronic airway disease (14% vs. 11%;

Key findings: 1) the median annual surgeon mitral volume is 10 operations; 2) wide variability of repair rates is observed among surgeons; 3) higher volume is associated
with higher repair rates and better outcomes; 4) reoperation after repair is less common for patients operated on by surgeons with $25 mitral valve operations a year;
and 5) low-volume surgeons (<25 operations/year) in institutions where high-volume, high-repair-rate surgeons (>50 operations/year and >70% repair rate) are
present have improved repair rates.

 surgeon volume and lower mitral valve repair rates in
the cohort with degenerative disease. The overall
mitral valve repair rate in the degenerative disease
cohort was 66.8% (n ¼ 3,660 of 5,475). The observed
degenerative disease repair rate according to mean
total annual surgeon volume is shown in the Central
Illustration.
After
multivariable
adjustment,
total
annual surgeon volume was independently associ-
ated with the probability of mitral valve repair; the
chance of repair increased by 13% for every 10-case
increment in total annual surgeon volume (adjusted
OR: 1.13/10-case increment; 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.17;
p < 0.001) (Figure 2). Compared with patients oper-
ated on by surgeons with a total annual surgeon
volume of #10 operations, patients operated on by
surgeons with a total annual surgeon volume of >50
operations were >3 times as likely to undergo mitral
valve repair (adjusted OR: 3.18; 95% CI: 2.02 to 5.00;
p < 0.001) (Table 2).
We observed a possible influence of a high-volume
and high-repair surgeon on low-volume surgeons in
the same institution. Among the 1,412 patients with
degenerative mitral valve disease who were operated
on
by
surgeons
with
a
total
annual
surgeon
volume <25, 20% (n ¼ 282) underwent mitral valve
surgery at centers where there was also an individual
surgeon carrying out >50 mitral valve operations
annually with a >70% degenerative disease repair
rate.
The
repair
rate
of
the
49
surgeons
who
performed <25 operations annually at such centers
was 63.8%, compared with 51.3% at the remaining
centers (adjusted OR: 1.79; 95% CI :1.24 to 2.60;
p ¼ 0.002).
REOPERATION AFTER MITRAL REPAIR. We observed
a significant association between low surgeon volume
and increased risk of mitral valve reoperation within
12 months of follow-up after mitral valve repair
(p ¼ 0.04). This relationship was nonlinear, and the
curve of the HR of reoperation changed its slope at a
total
annual
surgeon
volume
of
25
operations
(Figure 3). On the basis of these data, patients were
stratified into 2 volume groups (<25 operations/year
and $25 operations/year). The cumulative incidence
of reoperation at 12 months was 1.3% (95% CI: 1.0% to
1.8%) for patients operated on by a surgeon with a
total
annual
surgeon
volume
of
$25
operations
compared with 3.6% (95% CI: 2.4% to 5.0%) for pa-
tients operated on by a surgeon with total annual
surgeon volume of <25 operations (adjusted HR: 0.45;
95% CI: 0.26 to 0.76; p ¼ 0.003) (Figure 4). The sig-
nificant difference in reoperation rates persisted to 12
years (9.5%; 95% CI: 6.9% to 12.6% vs 6.2%; 95% CI:
5.0% to 7.7%, p < 0.001) (Online Figure 2).
SURVIVAL. We
observed
an
association
between
higher total annual surgeon volume and improved
survival after mitral valve operations controlling for
pre-operative risk factors. Total annual surgeon vol-
ume was independently associated with improved
1-year survival in the degenerative disease cohort
(adjusted HR: 0.95/10-case increment; 95% CI: 0.92 to
0.98; p ¼ 0.001). The actuarial survival after 1 year of
repair or replacement of patients with degenerative
mitral valve disease operated on by surgeons per-
forming >50 operations a year was 97.8% (95% CI:
97.1 to 98.4) compared with 94.1% (95% CI: 91.1 to
96.0) for patients operated on by surgeons perform-
ing #10 operations a year (Table 3). To evaluate
whether and how the effect of surgeon volume was
confounded by repair rates, we added repair versus
replacement to the previous model. Mitral repair

 (vs. replacement) was significantly associated with
better survival (adjusted HR: 0.80; 95% CI 0.68-0.94;
p ¼ 0.006), but total annual surgeon volume still
remained a significant independent predictor, despite
some attenuated effects (adjusted HR: 0.96/10-case
increment; 95% CI: 0.95 to 0.98; p < 0.001), a
finding
implying
that
better
patient
survival
by
higher-volume surgeons was explained not simply by
their higher repair rate alone, but also by the effect of
their higher volumes. In those patients who under-
went mitral valve repair, total annual surgeon volume
was an independent predictor of late death (adjusted
HR: 0.96/10-case increment; 95% CI: 0.94 to 0.98;
p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION
This New York State–wide multicenter analysis sug-
gests that individual surgeons’ mitral valve case
volume has a significant impact on early- and long-
term patients’ outcomes after mitral valve surgery.
We observed incremental benefits in terms of repair
rates,
survival,
and
reoperation
with
increasing
surgeon volume. Thus our data provide additional
strong
support
to
the
calls
for
systematically
focusing experience in mitral valve surgery (13–17).
Encouraging
targeted
referral,
with
the
goal
of
concentrating
surgical
volume,
should
help
to
address the wide variation in mitral valve repair
rates described in the United States and elsewhere
(3–10), a variation that persists despite the signifi-
cant benefits of mitral valve repair over replacement
(1,2). We found that a total annual surgeon volume
of <25 operations was associated not only with
lower
mitral
valve
repair
rates,
but
also
with
increased 1-year mortality and mitral valve reoper-
ation rates, and that improvements in repair rates,
survival, and freedom from reoperation continued
with increasing surgeon case volumes. The median
number of mitral valve operations performed annu-
ally by individual surgeons in the United States was
5, according to an analysis of The Society of Thoracic
Surgeons database (3); similarly, in New York State,
most surgeons actually performed <1 mitral opera-
tion/month. Our data indicate that there may be
several factors contributing to poorer outcomes in
patients operated on by the lower-volume surgeons
in this analysis.
We observed significant differences in the charac-
teristics of patients across surgeons’ case volume
groups. For example, the prevalence of congestive
heart failure was significantly higher in patients
operated on by surgeons with lower annual case
volumes, compared with surgeons with higher annual
case volumes. The proportion of patients undergoing
urgent surgery was also significantly higher for lower-
volume surgeons. This leads to a double jeopardy,
where sicker patients are adversely affected by the
lower repair rates and poorer outcomes seen with
lower-volume surgeons, and it underscores the need
to refer the highest-risk patients to high-volume
surgeons.
Importantly, we observed improved mitral valve
repair rates and survival in the patients of the lower-
volume surgeons if they operated at institutions
where there was a surgeon performing >50 total
mitral operations annually with a >70% degenera-
tive repair rate. One potential explanation for this
finding is the direct benefit of reviewing and oper-
ating on patients who require a technically complex
repair strategy with a more experienced surgeon and
surgical team. A second reason for this finding may
be that centers where mitral valve surgeons perform
a higher number of mitral valve repairs are more
likely to have cardiology, imaging, and critical care
teams optimally equipped to evaluate and manage
these patients. The demonstrated ability of experi-
enced centers to field multidisciplinary teams expe-
rienced
in
the
guideline-based
assessment
and
management of complex heart valve disease is the
main rationale for managing such patients in heart
valve referral centers (1,2). New and low-volume

 surgeons may be mentored and technically sup-
ported, thus allowing them to perform degenerative
mitral valve repair while successfully transforming
to high-volume surgeons. Even among high-volume
surgeons,
there
was
an
observed
variability
of
degenerative disease repair rates, ranging from 19%
to nearly 100%. This finding reflects that surgeon
volume is not the only factor for better outcomes,
and it emphasizes the need for more transparency of
surgeon-related factors and outcomes of degenera-
tive mitral valve surgery for patients and referring
cardiologists.
The
role
of
volume
thresholds
in
designating
referral
centers
and
surgeons
has
not
been
established. A volume threshold of 25 mitral valve
repairs/year for surgeons performing mitral surgery
was originally proposed in a consensus statement on
best practices in the United Kingdom, at a time when
no data on volume-outcome relationships for mitral
valve surgery were available (13). In the United States,
large health care purchasers, payers, and professional
organizations
have
already
established
minimum
volume standards for several surgical procedures, but
mitral valve surgery is not among these (18). Our data
suggest that focusing surgeon experience may help to
facilitate improvements in mitral valve repair rates
and
long-term
outcomes.
Until
then,
consensus
guideline standards (which require a high likelihood
of a durable repair for patients undergoing surgery for
degenerative mitral valve disease) (1,2) may best be
served by concentrating referrals among surgeons
performing $25 mitral valve operations annually.
Considering
that
there
was
an
incremental
improvement in survival and probability of repair
with increasing volume over 25 operations, one could
make the argument that a minimum volume target of
50, or even more, operations would be optimal.
Developing more very high-volume surgeons experi-
enced in mitral valve repair would likely be particu-
larly
beneficial
for
patients
with
complex,
but
repairable mitral valve disease and for asymptomatic
patients whose repair feasibility would optimally
approach 100% (19).
The main strength of this study is the ability to
analyze freedom from reoperation and mortality rates
in
a
large,
multicenter,
contemporary
cohort
of
patients undergoing surgery for degenerative disease
by using a statewide mandatory database.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. For this analysis, we used an
administrative
dataset
subject
to
well-recognized
limitations that can affect the reliability of informa-
tion obtained from it. Data may be entered by non-
clinicians and are subject to inaccurate coding of
patients’ diagnoses and procedures. Additionally,
ICD-9-CM codes do not perfectly distinguish degen-
erative from ischemic mitral valve disease, nor do
they provide detailed information on symptom sta-
tus, severity
of mitral valve disease, ventricular
function, pulmonary hypertension, or severity of
comorbidities (e.g., coronary disease). Because pre-
operative echocardiographic data or surgical reports
were not available, our creation of a subgroup of pa-
tients with degenerative disease relied on an exclu-
sionary process. We believe we were able to validate a
method of identifying patients with degenerative
disease with high specificity, but this was at the
expense of sensitivity. For example, we excluded
certain patients with degenerative mitral valve dis-
ease and concomitant coronary disease from our
analysis to minimize the inclusion of patients with
ischemic mitral regurgitation in our degenerative

 disease group. We also excluded nearly 10% of pa-
tients who lived out of New York State. Although the
use of a statewide, rather than a single-center, data-
base improved our ability to detect reoperations, we
could not identify patients with residual or recurrent
mitral regurgitation, patients who underwent valve
replacement for immediate failure of repair during
the same operation, or patients who subsequently
migrated out of state, thus potentially causing us to
underestimate the rate of repair failure. We excluded
2.5% of operations performed by surgeons where we
were unable to calculate their annual surgical vol-
umes; this could potentially contribute to under-
estimating the effect of volume on repair rates and
long-term
outcomes.
Each
surgeon’s
cumulative
experience was not analyzed because cumulative
volume could not be accurately calculated for sur-
geons who started their practice before the study
period or out of New York State. Finally, we were
unable to adjust for referral bias, which may cause us
to
overestimate
the
number
of
mitral
valves
amenable to repair seen by low-volume surgeons, as
well as the impact of more complex repairs seen by
higher-volume surgeons.
CONCLUSIONS
In this 12-year analysis of patients operated on for
mitral valve disease in New York State, surgeons
performing <25 mitral valve operations/year were
significantly
more
likely
to
replace,
rather
than
repair, mitral valves in patients with degenerative
disease than were surgeons performing $25 mitral
valve
operations/year.
Additionally,
patients
operated
on
by
the
lower-volume
surgeons
had
significantly worse survival and were significantly
more likely to undergo reoperation in long-term
follow-up
than
patients
operated
on
by
higher-
volume surgeons. Incremental benefits, in terms of
repair rates, reoperation, and survival, continued
with increasing surgeon volume, up to the highest-
volume surgeons in the study cohort. The presence
of a high-volume surgeon was associated with better
repair rates achieved by low-volume surgeons oper-
ating
at
the
same
institution. Our
data
support
concentrating surgeons’ experience in mitral valve
surgery and the concept of centers of excellence in
mitral valve repair.
