 INTRODUCTION
In 2014, The National Institute for Health 
and Care Excellence (NICE) released 
updated guidelines for cardiovascular risk 
assessment and lipid-lowering medication.1 
The new guidelines expanded the eligible 
population for statin therapy to adults 
without a history of cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) with a ≥10% 10-year CVD risk, 
whereas the 2008 guidelines recommended 
treatment only for those at ≥20% risk.2 
In addition, NICE now recommends the 
QRISK2 algorithm to estimate CVD risk. 
Previously, no specific risk algorithm was 
endorsed.3
Although they have been subject to much 
debate,4–7 the 2014 NICE guidelines and 
their implications for the general population 
have scarcely been investigated. In this 
paper, the authors first sought to examine 
the QRISK2 risk algorithm to determine 
risk factor levels required to exceed the 10% 
risk threshold. They then used data from 
the Health Survey for England (HSE) 20118 
to estimate the number, and summarise 
the risk factor profile, of adults who will be 
eligible for statin therapy under the new 
guidelines. 
METHOD
Examination of QRISK2 
The authors estimated the 10-year CVD risk 
using QRISK2, updated in 2015,9 for males 
and females between 30 and 84 years of 
age in 5-year increments, using different 
combinations of the 15 risk factors included 
in the algorithm.9,10 
First, the authors assessed the impact 
of individual risk factors on the estimated 
10-year risk. They varied the level of each 
risk factor separately across the entire 
range of values permitted by QRISK2, while 
holding other risk factors constant at their 
median or most commonly observed levels 
in HSE 2011. Risk factors that were not 
available in the survey were set to ‘no’ 
(Appendix 1). The authors conducted the 
analysis for systolic blood pressure with and 
without treatment for hypertension. The 
authors also estimated the 10-year CVD 
risk for profiles with all risk factor levels 
set to the median or most common values 
in the HSE sample, by ethnicity and sex. 
 
Next, the authors estimated the 10-year 
CVD risk using QRISK2 for a set of risk 
profiles with different levels of a subset 
of risk factors that are deemed more 
modifiable: body mass index (BMI), total-to-
high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 
ratio, systolic blood pressure, type 2 
diabetes, and smoking status. They used 
risk factor levels considered as optimal 
(a 1), and then added one elevated risk 
factor at a time, starting from the most 
Research
Abstract
Background
The 2014 guidelines on cardiovascular risk 
assessment and lipid modification from 
the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE) recommend statin therapy 
for adults with prevalent cardiovascular disease 
(CVD), and for adults with a 10-year CVD risk of 
≥10%, estimated using the QRISK2 algorithm.
Aim
To determine risk factor levels required to 
exceed the risk threshold for statin therapy, and 
to estimate the number of adults in England 
who would require statin therapy under the 
guidelines.
Design and setting
Cross-sectional study using a sample 
representative of the English population aged 
30–84 years. 
Method
To estimate 10-year CVD risk different 
combinations of risk factor levels were entered 
into the QRISK2 algorithm. The NICE guidelines 
were applied to the sample using data from the 
Health Survey for England 2011. 
Results
Even with optimal risk factor levels, males of 
different ethnicities would exceed the 10% risk 
threshold between the ages of 60 and 70 years, 
and females would exceed the threshold between 
65 and 75 years. Under the NICE guidelines, 
11.8 million males and females (37% of the adults 
aged 30–84 years) would require statin therapy, 
most of them (9.8 million) for primary prevention. 
When analysed by age, 95% of males and 66% 
of females without CVD in ages 60–74 years, 
including all males and females in ages 
75–84 years, would require statin therapy. 
Conclusion
Under the 2014 NICE guidelines, 11.8 million 
(37%) adults in England aged 30–84 years, 
including almost all males >60 years in all 
females >75 years, require statin therapy.

 prevalent in the HSE sample. The authors 
performed these analyses for white males 
and females, and the remaining risk factors 
were set to the most common values in the 
HSE sample as described above. For the 
profile with optimal risk factor levels, the 
authors also performed the analyses for 
each ethnicity.
Application of the 2014 NICE guidelines 
in the HSE
The authors used the subsample of 
HSE 2011 participants who had provided 
a blood sample,8 because it included 
questions about lifetime history of CVD, 
whereas other years of the same survey 
allowed the participants to list their current 
longstanding illnesses that may have led 
to under-reporting of prevalent CVD. Of 
the 3564 participants aged 30–84 years 
in the subsample, the authors excluded 
592 participants who had missing data 
on any of the risk factors included in 
the application of the QRISK2 algorithm 
(age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, type 
2 diabetes, BMI, systolic blood pressure, 
blood-pressure-lowering 
medication, 
and total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio). The 
final study population included 2972 HSE 
participants. The authors set Townsend 
deprivation score to 0 and the remaining 
predictors in the QRISK2 equation to ‘no’ 
for all participants, because information 
about the risk factors was not available in 
the HSE. For the same reason, the authors 
considered all participants with diabetes to 
have type 2 diabetes, and in the analyses 
did not consider the recommendations to 
offer statins to patients with chronic kidney 
disease, and to patients with type 1 diabetes 
aged ≥40 years. 
Statistical analysis
The authors calculated 10-year CVD risk 
for each of the HSE participants using 
QRISK2. They then used sample weights 
to determine the proportion of the English 
population for whom statin therapy is 
recommended under the 2014 NICE 
guidelines. This proportion was multiplied 
by a population of 31.9 million English 
adults aged 30–84 years, and the number of 
adults who would require statin therapy was 
estimated. For those without prevalent CVD, 
the authors conducted these analyses by sex 
and age group (30–44 years, 45–59 years, 
60–74 years, and 75–84 years). Finally, the 
How this fits in
The 2014 guidelines on cardiovascular 
risk assessment and lipid modification 
from the National Institute for Health 
and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends 
statin therapy to patients with existing 
cardiovascular disease, and to patients 
without cardiovascular disease who have 
a 10-year risk of disease at ≥10%, as 
predicted by the QRISK2 algorithm. This 
study confirmed that age was an important 
driver of risk in the QRISK2 algorithm, 
and that from the age of 60–75 years, 
depending on sex and ethnicity, the risk 
threshold for primary prevention was 
exceeded in all adults, including those 
with no increased risk factors. Under 
the guidelines, 11.8 million (37%) adults 
in England aged 30–84 years, including 
almost all males >60 years and all females 
>75 years, would be eligible for statin 
therapy.

was set to the average level in adults aged 30–84 years with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 in the Health Survey for England 2011. High total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio was set to the average 
level among adults with a ratio of ≥4 and who were not receiving statins. Treated systolic blood pressure was set to the average level among adults who received blood pressure 
medication. For all risk factor profiles, ethnicity was set to ‘white or not stated’, Townsend deprivation score was set to 0, and remaining risk factors were set to ‘no’ (type 1 diabetes,

Figure 1. The 10-year CVD risk estimated with QRISK2, and by varying levels of single risk factors in hypothetical white males and females at selected ages.a  
aOther risk factors in the risk prediction equation were either held constant at median levels in HSE 2011 (BMI, systolic BP, total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio) or assumed to be 
non-existent (type 1 and 2 diabetes, smoking, treated hypertension, family history of coronary heart disease in first-degree relative <60 years, chronic kidney disease, atrial 
fibrillation, rheumatoid arthritis, and Townsend score). BMI = body mass index. CVD = cardiovascular disease. HDL = high-density lipoprotein. HSE = Health Survey for England.

 authors used a logistic regression model 
to compare the characteristics of adults 
without CVD who were already on statin 
treatment with those of the adults who were 
eligible but not receiving statins. Analyses 
were made using Stata 12.
RESULTS
Figure 1 shows the 10-year CVD risk 
estimated when varying the level of each 
risk factor separately across the entire 
range of values permitted by QRISK2, 
while holding other risk factors constant at 
median values. BMI and Townsend score 
had modest effects on CVD risk compared 
with total-to-HDL ratio and treated systolic 
blood pressure in both males and females. 
For example, increasing BMI from 20 to 
40 kg/m2 (the full range in QRISK2) in a 
60-year-old male with median risk factor 
levels increased the predicted risk from 9.5 
to 10.4%. In contrast, the risk estimated 
using the full range of treated systolic blood 
pressure (70 to 210 mmHg) in the same 
male increased the risk from 9.0 to 19.2% 
(Figure 1). Of the categorical risk factors, 
type 1 diabetes had the largest impact on 
estimated risk in both males and females 
(further data available from the authors 
upon request). It increased the risk from 
9.6 to 24.4% in a 60-year-old white male 
with median risk factor levels, and from 4.8 
to 16.2% for a female with the same risk 
factor profile. 
The association between risk factors and 
CVD risk was modified by age. Negative 
age interactions were reflected in weaker 
associations between risk factors and 
CVD risk in higher ages. For example, in 
a 40-year-old white male with median risk 
factor levels, type 2 diabetes increased CVD 
risk from 1.4 to 3.9% (relative risk [RR] 2.8) 
whereas the corresponding risk increase 
for an 80-year-old male with the same 
risk factor profile was 35 to 46% (RR 1.3) 
(further data available from the authors 
upon request). RRs for the lowest versus 
the highest Townsend deprivation score 
(–7 versus 11) for the same male were 1.7 
at the age of 40 years, and 1.0 at the age of 
80 years (Figure 1). 
The 10-year CVD risk estimated with 
QRISK2 for white males and females with 
different risk factor profiles are shown in 
Figure 2. An obese white male with treated 
hypertension and a high total-to-HDL 
cholesterol ratio did not exceed the 10% risk 
threshold until the age of 55 years, whereas 
the threshold was exceeded at the age of 40 
if he had type 2 diabetes, and at the age of 30 
if he also was a moderate smoker
. An obese 
white female with treated hypertension and 
a high total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio did 
not exceed the 10% risk threshold until the 
age of 65 years. But the risk threshold was 
exceeded at the age of 45 if she had type 2 
diabetes, and at the age of 30 if she also 
was a moderate smoker 
The 10% risk threshold was exceeded by 
males and females even if they had optimal 
risk factor levels (Figure 3). A male with 
optimal risk factor levels would exceed 
the risk threshold at the age of 60 years 
if he was of Bangladeshi, Pakistani, or 
Indian origin, and at the age of 70 years 
regardless of his ethnicity. A female with 
optimal risk factor levels would exceed the 
risk threshold by the age of 65 years if she 
was of Pakistani or Bangladeshi origin, and 
between the ages of 65 and 75 years if she 
was of other ethnicities. The proportion 
of English adults in the HSE with optimal 
risk factor levels was 2%, and adults with 
median risk factor levels exceeded the 
threshold earlier, at ages 55 to shortly after 
70 years, depending on sex and ethnicity 
(further data available from the authors 
upon request).
In total, 11.8 million (out of 31.9 million; 
37%) English adults aged 30–84 years 
required statin therapy under the 2014 NICE 
guidelines. Of the 9.8 million adults without 
CVD who would require statins (33% of the 
population without CVD), 3.5 million adults 
(12%) were already receiving statins and 
6.3 million adults (21%) were eligible for 
treatment (Table 2). Of the 2.0 million adults 
with existing CVD, 380 000 (19%) were not 
receiving statins. 
Most adults who were eligible or treated 
for primary prevention were in older age 
groups. Although only 4% of males aged 
30–44 years and free of existing CVD 
required statin therapy, this proportion was 
33% in ages 45–59 years, 95% in ages 
60–74 years, and 100% in ages 75–84 years. 
The corresponding numbers for females 
were 2% in ages 30–44 years, 10% in ages 
45–59 years, 66% in ages 60–74 years, and 
100% in ages 75–84 years (Figure 4). In 
the logistic regression model, independent 
predictors of receiving statins compared 
with being eligible but untreated were 
younger age, diabetes and blood pressure 
treatment, no hypertension, and no current 
smoking (Table 2). Weight status (P = 0.62), 
ethnicity (P = 0.65), and multiple deprivation 
quintile (P = 0.99) were not associated with 
receiving statins.
DISCUSSION
Summary
The authors estimated that, under the 
updated NICE guidelines, 11.8 million 
British Journal of General Practice, September 2017  e601
 English males and females would be 
receiving or eligible for statin therapy, 
representing 37% of the adults in ages 
30–84 years. The majority of these adults 
(9.8 million) would be treated or eligible 
for primary prevention. Under the new 
guidelines, 95% of males and two-thirds 
of females without existing CVD in ages 
60–74 years, and all males and females 
in ages 75–84 years, would require statin 
therapy. 
The QRISK2 algorithm gives a large 
weight to age as a predictor of CVD risk.10 
Even with optimal risk factor levels, males 
of different ethnicities would exceed the 
10% risk threshold between the ages of 60 
and 70 years, and females would exceed 
the threshold between 65 and 75 years. The

exceed the treatment threshold at an 
earlier age. 
Strengths and limitations
The authors used a nationally representative 
sample of English adults and visualised 
characteristics of the QRISK2 algorithm. 
The study has limitations. First, the authors 
had to set a number of risk factors in 
the QRISK2 algorithm to ‘no’ (type 1 
diabetes, family history of coronary heart 
disease, chronic kidney disease, atrial 
fibrillation, and rheumatoid arthritis), 
because data were not available, and they 
may therefore have underestimated the 
risk in the population and the number of 
adults eligible for statin therapy under the 
2014 NICE guidelines. Second, the authors 
only used one HSE sample from 2011, 
because it was the only survey that included 
questions on lifetime CVD history. Third, the 
authors could not assess the eligibility of 
the adults who were already on treatment 
for primary prevention, because they could 
not determine why statin therapy had been 
initiated. Finally, in the examination of the

 QRISK2 algorithm, the authors focused on 
a particular set of risk factor combinations, 
although other risk factor combinations 
may be more commonly observed in the 
population of England.
Comparison with existing literature
The importance of age in the QRISK2 
algorithm has already been reported.10 This 
means that all adults, including those with 
no increased risk factors, at some point 
in their lives are likely to be eligible for 
statin therapy. There is limited evidence 
from clinical trials on statin efficacy 
among older people,14 and uncertainties 
remain regarding adverse effects.15 As is 
recommended in the NICE guidelines, as 
well as in other national and international 
guidelines,16 a physician–patient discussion 
should precede decisions on statin therapy, 
in particular for patients whose eligibility for 
treatment is based solely on their age.
Conversely, the QRISK2 algorithm does 
not assign a risk above the treatment 
threshold for many males and females 
in younger age groups, even if they have

aNumbers are shown in thousands and per cent of population for categorical variables, and median and interquartile range for continuous ones. Numbers do not correspond to the 
column total for IMD quintile and for ethnicity in those receiving statins because of rounding. bOdds ratios for receiving statins versus being eligible but not treated were estimated 
using a logistic regression model with the following independent variables: female sex, age (per 10 years), ethnicity (reference = white or not stated), Index of Multiple Deprivation 
quintile (reference = least deprived), completed higher education, urban resident, hypertension, receiving blood pressure medication, diabetes, weight status (reference = BMI 
<25 kg/m2), and smoking status (reference = never smoker). cP-value (Wald test): ethnicity = 0.65, Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles = 0.99, weight status = 0.62. dThe QRISK2 
algorithm only permits total-to-HDL cholesterol ratios of up to 12, and BMI values ranging from 20 to 40 kg/m2. Therefore, in the estimation of 10-year CVD risk using QRISK2, 
total-to-HDL cholesterol ratios of >12 were set to 12 in two participants (out of the total 2972 participants), BMI values of <20 kg/m2 were set to 20 kg/m2 in 78 participants, and 
BMI values of >40 kg/m2 were set to 40 kg/m2 in 78 participants. BMI = body mass index. BP = blood pressure. CVD = cardiovascular disease. HDL = high-density lipoprotein.

 Figure 4. Proportion of the adult English population

high levels of multiple risk factors. Younger 
patients with several elevated risk factors 
may therefore benefit from an assessment 
of their long-term CVD risk (for example, 
lifetime risk17 or ‘heart age’18,19).
Although heatedly debated,4–7 the 2014 
NICE guidelines and their implications 
for the general population have not been 
subject to much investigation. The costing 
report that accompanied the 2014 NICE 
guidelines estimated that 25% of the adult 
population of England free of existing CVD 
would be eligible for statins under the 2014 
NICE guidelines.20 The authors estimated 
that 33% of the adults without CVD would 
require statins, including the 12% who were 
already receiving treatment for primary 
prevention.
Assuming that the 10-year CVD risk 
estimated with QRISK2 accurately reflects 
future CVD risk, the authors estimated that 
there would be 1.16 million cardiovascular 
events over the next 10 years among the 
6.3 million adults without existing CVD 
who were currently untreated and eligible 
for statin therapy under the 2014 NICE 
guidelines. If a 25% risk reduction from statin 
use, corresponding to a 1 mmol reduction 
in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, 
is assumed for primary prevention, as 
reported in a meta-analysis of clinical 
trials,21 and adherence to treatment similar 
to that in the trials, full implementation of 
the 2014 NICE guidelines would prevent 
290 000 of these events. 
It is, however, unlikely that all eligible 
adults will receive statins. The 2014 NICE 
guidelines recommend an informed risk–
benefit 
discussion 
between 
the 
physician 
and 
the patient. A treatment recommendation 
will therefore not necessarily lead to 
treatment initiation. Moreover, the effects of 
the expanded recommendations for statin 
therapy may be limited by an incomplete 
implementation of the guidelines. In fact, 
a report using data from the Clinical 
Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) during 
the years 2007–2011 showed that 69% of 
the patients who were eligible for statin 
therapy under the previous 2008 guidelines

were not receiving statins.22 Compared with 
those already under statin therapy, the 
authors’ analyses also showed that the 
adults who were untreated and eligible 
under the 2014 NICE guidelines were less 
likely to be diabetic and receiving blood 
pressure treatment, and therefore they 
could be harder to identify and treat, as their 
contact with the healthcare system may 
be less frequent. In addition, adherence 
to statin therapy has been reported to be 
low in everyday clinical practice. A recent 
study using data from CPRD showed that 
47% of the patients prescribed statins as 
primary prevention had at least 90 days of 
discontinued treatment during a median 
follow-up time of 137 weeks.23 
Implications for practice
Even if providing statin therapy to a large 
part of the population is deemed to be cost-
effective,1,20,24 it will still require resources to 
screen, treat, and monitor the patients who 
are put on treatment. The approximately 
33 000 GPs (full-time equivalents, excluding 
registrars and retainers) in England25 would 
need to treat close to 200 patients each 
to provide statin therapy to those who are 
untreated but eligible for treatment under 
the NICE guidelines. Implementation of 
the NICE guidelines should be considered 
in the context of opportunity costs for 
primary care and its available resources, 
in particular given the high and increasing 
workload facing GPs in England.26
