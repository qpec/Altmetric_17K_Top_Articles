Ebola virus causes hemorrhagic fever with a high case fatality rate for which there
is no approved therapy. Two human monoclonal antibodies, mAb100 and mAb114, in
combination, protect nonhuman primates against all signs of Ebola virus disease, including
viremia. Here, we demonstrate that mAb100 recognizes the base of the Ebola virus
glycoprotein (GP) trimer, occludes access to the cathepsin-cleavage loop, and prevents
the proteolytic cleavage of GP that is required for virus entry. We show that mAb114
interacts with the glycan cap and inner chalice of GP
, remains associated after proteolytic
removal of the glycan cap, and inhibits binding of cleaved GP to its receptor. These
results define the basis of neutralization for two protective antibodies and may facilitate
development of therapies and vaccines.
E
bola virus (EBOV) causes a rapidly fatal
hemorrhagic fever for which there is cur-
rently no treatment (1–3). We recently iso-
lated two monoclonal antibodies (mAb100
and mAb114) from a 1995 Kikwit Ebola
survivor that potently neutralize multiple EBOV
isolates spanning more than 40 years (4). When
administered as a cocktail to rhesus macaques,
these antibodies fully protected from clinical symp-
toms, viremia, and death. Furthermore, mAb114
monotherapy fully protected macaques from death
and illness when given as late as 5 days after in-
fection (4). In this study, we sought to identify
the structural and molecular basis of neutraliza-
tion for these protective antibodies.
The EBOV glycoprotein (GP) is a class I fusion
protein comprising disulfide-linked subunits, GP1
and GP2, which associate to form a chalice-shaped
trimer (5–7). The GP1 subunit binds to the EBOV
receptor, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), allowing GP2-
mediated fusion of the viral and host-cell mem-
branes (5, 8–11). The GP1 subunit contains a core
domain and a “glycan cap,” which are shielded
by the heavily glycosylated mucin-like domain
(MLD) (Fig. 1A). The MLD is dispensable for vi-
rus entry but is a target for host antibody responses
(6, 7, 12–16). Using immunoprecipitation (IP), we
found that mAb100 and mAb114 recognized GP
ectodomains lacking the MLD (GPDMuc), suggest-
ing that their epitopes reside elsewhere on GP
(Fig. 1B) (17).
To identify the epitopes recognized by these
antibodies, crystal structures of their antigen-
binding fragments (Fab100 and Fab114) were
determined individually to 2.0 Å and in a ternary
complex with GPDMuc to 6.7 Å (table S1 and fig.
S1, A and B). The complex structure was solved
by molecular replacement using the refined
structures of the unbound Fabs and the previ-
ously solved EBOV GPDMuc structure (6) as search
models and was refined to an Rwork/Rfree of 26.0/
34.3% (table S1). The crystal structure shows that
Fab100 binds to the base of GP, parallel to the
viral membrane, makes contacts with both GP1
and GP2, and cross-links two adjacent protomers
(Fig. 1C and fig. S1C). In contrast, Fab114 binds
within the GP chalice, perpendicular to the viral
membrane, and makes contacts with both the
glycan cap and the GP1 core (Fig. 1C and fig. S1C).
Because GP binds NPC1 in acidic late-endosomes
and lysosomes (8–12, 16), we compared antibody
binding to GPDMuc at neutral and low pH using
cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The
structures of the ternary complexes at pH 7.4
and 5.0 were calculated to a resolution of 9 Å by
single-particle reconstruction (fig. S2). The ternary-
complex crystal structure fit well as a rigid body
into the cryo-EM densities (Fig. 2). Further rigid-
body refinement of the Fabs and GP did not change
the overall structure substantially, indicating that
the crystal structure closely resembles the cryo-
EM structure. Comparisons of the cryo-EM struc-
tures at pH 7.4 and 5.0 revealed highly similar
structures (Fig. 2 and fig. S2C), suggesting that
these antibodies would remain associated with GP
during trafficking of EBOV to low-pH compart-
ments. Analysis of the cryo-EM structure also re-
vealed a bulky density near the Fab100 interface
that would be consistent with an N-linked glycan
at residue Asn563 of GP (6, 7) (fig. S3A). Enzymatic
trimming of the glycans using endoglycosidase H
(EndoH) did not appreciably alter Fab100 bind-
ing to GP, suggesting that N-linked glycans are
not critical for Fab100 recognition (fig. S4, A to C).
Binding of Fab100 to the base of the GP tri-
mer (Fig. 1C and fig. S1C) resembles that of
KZ52, a prototypic neutralizing antibody that
does not confer protection in macaques (6, 18, 19).
However, Fab100 is rotated about the trimeric
axis by ~60° with respect to KZ52 (fig. S3B). This
rotation enables Fab100 to contact GP1 and GP2
of one protomer, as well as the internal fusion
loop (IFL) of the neighboring protomer, whereas
KZ52 contacts only a single protomer (fig. S3C).
Fab100 is also in close proximity to the b13-b14
loop (Fig. 3A) (residues 190 to 213), which is dis-
ordered in the previous structure (6). Biochemical
studies have shown that EBOV entry requires
cleavage of this loop by cathepsins L and B
(11, 12, 20–23), which releases the glycan cap and
MLD, exposing the receptor-bindingdomain (RBD)
within the GP1 core (8–12, 20, 21). Interestingly,
the cryo-EM structure revealed additional elec-
tron density corresponding to portions of the
b13-b14 loop in close proximity to the Fab100
light chain (Fig. 3A). The observed density would
be expected to accommodate residues 190 to
197 and 209 to 213 and may accommodate
additional residues depending on the confor-
mation of the b13-b14 loop, which is difficult to
determine given the weak electron density of this
region. We therefore hypothesized that Fab100
would sterically block proteolysis by cathepsins.
To test this, we used cathepsin L (Cat L) to digest
GPDMuc that was pretreated with mAb114, mAb100,
KZ52, or control mAb. The amount of cleaved GP1
(GP120k) was similar in the control and mAb114
reactions (Fig. 3B). Consistent with previous re-
ports, KZ52 delayed the appearance of GP120k (24).
For mAb100, the primary product was an inter-
mediate form (GP1i) with only trace amounts of
GP120k, indicating that mAb100 significantly re-
duced GP1 cleavage (Fig. 3B). Similarly, cleavage
of GP1 by thermolysin, which mimics cathepsin
B (Cat B) (8, 11, 20, 23), was inhibited by mAb100
(fig. S4D). These data suggest that mAb100 neu-
tralizes EBOV by sterically blocking cathepsin
cleavage of the b13-b14 loop.
We next determined the affinity of Fab100
and KZ52 for GPDMuc at neutral and low pH.
The affinity of Fab100 was ~5 and ~10 times
stronger than KZ52 at pH 7.4 and 5.3, respec-
tively (Fig. 3C and fig. S4A), suggesting that
mAb100 remains tightly associated with GP in
low-pH compartments. Notably, the affinity of
KZ52 for thermolysin-cleaved GP (GPTHL) at

 pH 5.3 was decreased by a factor of more than
1000 as compared with uncleaved GP. For Fab100,
a modestly reduced affinity for GPTHL was driven
primarily by a faster dissociation rate (Fig. 3C
and fig. S4A). However, the dissociation rate con-
stant (koff) of the bivalent mAb100 immuno-
globulin G (IgG) was similar between uncleaved
and GPTHL (fig. S5), suggesting that mAb100 re-
mains bound even after proteolytic cleavage at low
pH. Due to the quaternary nature of the mAb100
epitope, which includes the internal fusion loop,
mAb100 may also prevent conformational rear-
rangements of GP that occur downstream of
proteolytic cleavage. Antibodies with quaternary
epitopes have been recently identified that po-
tently neutralize other viruses, suggesting that this
mode of binding represents a powerful immuno-
logical solution to viral entry (25–27).
Unlike mAb100, mAb114 recognizes an epitope
spanning both the glycan cap and the GP1 core
(Figs. 4A and 1C). Most contacts appear to be
made between the CDR H3 and L3 of Fab114 and
the loop connecting b8 and b9 of the GP1 core
(6). The importance of this region for mAb114
binding was confirmed by CLIPS (chemical link-
age of peptides onto scaffolds) conformational-
epitope mapping (28) (fig. S6A). Because the
contacts within the GP1 core remain after ca-
thepsin cleavage (fig. S7A), we investigated mAb114
binding to GPTHL using IP and found that GPTHL
was recognized similarly to GP and GPDMuc (Fig.
4B). Furthermore, negative-stain EM showed
that the binding orientation of Fab114 to GPTHL
was similar to GPDMuc (Fig. 4C), demonstrating
that the glycan cap is dispensable for mAb114–
GP interaction.
Because EBOV particles transit from neutral to
low-pH compartments (12, 16, 20), we measured
binding kinetics of Fab114 to GPDMuc at pH 7.4
and 5.3 and observed similar subnanomolar affin-
ities (Fig. 4D and fig. S6B). When compared
with antibody 13C6, which competes with mAb114
for binding to GP (4) but is not protective in
macaques (15, 29), Fab114 has a significantly
slower koff, leading to an affinity that is tighter by
factors of more than 250 and 40 at pH 7.4 and
5.3, respectively (Fig. 4D and fig. S6B). Impor-
tantly, 13C6 only makes contact with the glycan
cap (30), whereas mAb114 bound GP after glycan
cap removal (Fig. 4, B and C). The affinity of Fab114
for GPTHL at pH 5.3 remained high [equilibrium
dissociation constant (KD) of 8.0 nM], consistent
with our structural data showing that Fab114
primarily contacts residues within the GP1 core.
After cathepsin cleavage of GP1, a hydrophobic
pocket is exposed on the GP1 core that is formed
primarily by a1 and b4 and bordered by charged
residues in b7, b8, and b9. These regions have been
proposed to be the RBD of EBOV GP (6, 23, 31–36).
Our data suggested that the interaction of mAb114
with residues in b7 to b9 might block NPC1 access
to this pocket. To investigate this, we performed a
competition assay with mAb114, GPTHL, and
NPC1 domain C (NPC1-dC)—the domain respon-
sible for engaging cleaved GP and mediating
virus entry (8–10). Using biolayer interferome-
try, we found that when mAb114 was bound to
GPTHL, NPC1-dC was unable to bind (Fig. 4E and
fig. S6C). Similar results were obtained using IP
(fig. S6D). These findings are consistent with the
observation that both Fab114 and NPC1-dC have
similar affinities for GPTHL (Fig. 4D and fig.
S6B) and indicate that mAb114 neutralizes EBOV
infection by preventing binding of cathepsin-
cleaved GP to its receptor NPC1.

 Despite being in the same competition group
as mAb114 (4), antibody 13C6 fails to neutralize
EBOV due to its inability to remain bound to GP
after cathepsin cleavage. Conversely, the Marburg
GP-antibody MR78 recognizes an analogous
receptor-binding domain on Marburg GP and
also binds to cleaved EBOV GP, yet fails to neu-
tralize EBOV due to its inability to recognize the
native trimer (uncleaved GP) (34, 35). The failure
of MR78 to bind native EBOV GP led to the hy-
pothesis that NPC1-blocking antibodies might
not be elicited during Ebola virus infection (34).
Strikingly, mAb114 overcomes these structural
constraints by binding to the center of the GP1
chalice with a near-vertical angle of approach
(85° with respect to the viral membrane) that
allows access to the GP1 core. The recently pub-
lishedcrystalstructure of NPC1-dCboundtoGPTHL
revealed that in addition to making contacts
with the hydrophobic pocket exposed by removal
of the glycan cap and MLD, NPC1 also contacts
the surrounding charged region in b7 to b9 that
is bound by mAb114 (fig. S7B) (36). Taken together,
these data reveal a key site of vulnerability in the
EBOV GP targeted by mAb114 and demonstrate
that this class of antibodies can be elicited by
natural infection.

 The experiments herein reveal that mAb100
and mAb114 mediate virus neutralization by tar-
geting independent essential steps in EBOV en-
try: exposure of the RBD by protease cleavage
and receptor binding. Because these steps are
required for the entry of all members of the
Filoviridae family (8, 11), our studies identify
vulnerabilities targeted by the host immune
system that could potentially be exploited in
vaccine and therapeutic development.
