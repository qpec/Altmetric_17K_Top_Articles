ABSTRACT
Antibiotic tolerance and persistence are often associated with treatment failure and relapse, yet are poorly char-
acterized. In distinction from resistance, which is measured using the minimum inhibitory concentration metric, tolerance and
persistence values are not currently evaluated in the clinical setting, and so are overlooked when a course of treatment is pre-
scribed. In this article, we introduce a metric and an automated experimental framework for measuring tolerance and persis-
tence. The tolerance metric is the minimum duration for killing 99% of the population, MDK99, which can be evaluated by a
statistical analysis of measurements performed manually or using a robotic system. We demonstrate the technique on strains
of Escherichia coli with various tolerance levels. We hope that this, to our knowledge, new approach will be used, along with the
existing minimum inhibitory concentration, as a standard for the in vitro characterization of sensitivity to antimicrobials. Quan-
tification of tolerance and persistence may provide vital information in healthcare, and aid research in the field.
INTRODUCTION
The emergence and spread of resistant pathogens as a result
of antibiotic selective pressure is a major concern in modern
healthcare. Resistance is typically achieved by mutations
that reduce the activity of an antibiotic, for example by
decreasing drug binding to the target. The level of resistance
is quantified for each bacterial isolate by the minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC), which is the minimal con-
centration required to prevent bacterial growth (1). The
MIC is routinely measured in hospitals, and is a crucial fac-
tor in decisions regarding antibiotic treatment.
Tolerance, on the other hand, is a poorly characterized
phenomenon, and is seldom taken into account explicitly
in healthcare. Unlike resistance, which is an increase of
the drug concentration in which the bacteria can grow indef-
initely, tolerance is an extension of the period of time that
bacteria can survive in lethal concentrations of an antibiotic
(many times the MIC) before succumbing to its effects (2).
There are several mechanisms possibly underlying toler-
ance, recently reviewed elsewhere (3,4). For example, toler-
ance to b-lactams may be achieved by a decreased rate of
cell-wall building (5), and tolerance to fluoroquinolone re-
sults from a decreased rate of DNA replication (6). It is note-
worthy that many antibiotics target essential growth
processes and, as a result, many tolerance mechanisms
cause a decrease in growth rate.
It has been observed that tolerance can be heterogeneous
in bacterial populations, namely that subpopulations with
different tolerance levels may coexist within the same
clonal population, a phenomenon termed ‘‘persistence’’
(7), or more precisely ‘‘time-dependent persistence’’ (4).
For example, when only a small subpopulation of transiently
dormant bacteria are present in a bacterial population, they
will be able to persist for a longer period of time under anti-
biotic treatment, compared to the majority of fast growing
bacteria. This effect is apparent in a biphasic time-kill curve
(8), and may be viewed a special case of tolerance. Other
survival strategies exist, including different forms of persis-
tence (4,9,10). These are not discussed here, as they are not
tolerance-based, although some may be of similar clinical
relevance.
Although tolerance may seem less advantageous than
resistance, this is only true when long-term exposure to a
drug is considered. Under changing conditions, however,
tolerance may have a strong advantage, which could
have a profound impact on the evolutionary outcome (11).
For example, it has been shown that the extension of lag-
time, namely the prolonged time to resumption of growth
after starvation, evolves fast under intermittent antibiotic
treatments and confers high tolerance, before any sign of

 resistance appears (12). Such increased survival has been
shown to provide a window of opportunity for the popula-
tion, facilitating the evolution of resistance (13,14). More-
over, tolerance may provide increased survival under
treatment with antibiotics from different classes, as long
as they target growth processes. From an immediate clinical
point of view, the few surviving tolerant bacteria, those that
can outwait antibiotic treatment, may be sufficient to restart
an infection once treatment is stopped (15).
Although research into tolerance is ongoing, definitions
and measurement techniques are limited (3,4,16). The stan-
dard method used to evaluate tolerance is by performing
time-kill measurements. In this method, bacteria are
exposed to an antibiotic, and viable CFUs are plotted against
time (Fig. 1). When the killing is strictly exponential, the
killing rate can be used to quantify tolerance. However,
time-kill curves rarely fulfill this criterion (Fig. 1), and
therefore the killing rate cannot be utilized to compare
different strains and conditions. Instead, we have defined a
simple timescale parameter to characterize tolerance,
much like the MIC is a concentration-scale characterization
of resistance (1). We termed this parameter the minimum
duration for killing a certain percentile of the population
(MDK), with the percentile added as an index—thus,
MDK99 is the minimum duration for killing 99% of the pop-
ulation; MDK99.9 is the minimum duration for killing 99.9%
of the population, etc. A comparatively high MDK suggests
that bacterial killing requires more time, i.e., corresponds to
high tolerance. The tolerant strain plotted in Fig. 1 (blue)
evolved from the ancestral strain (green) under intermittent
ampicillin treatment, and acquired a mutation leading to a
long lag. The mutation had no effect on the MIC (12).
The high tolerance of this strain is apparent from the slower
killing, which is quantified by the 10-fold increase in the
MDK99, in comparison to that of the ancestral strain (Fig. 1).
Time-kill curves, however, are labor intensive and are
rarely performed in the clinical setting. Therefore, we pre-
sent, to our knowledge, a new method to directly quantify
tolerance, without performing time-kill curves, and a more
formal definition of the metric used to quantify tolerance,
namely the MDK. We propose that the MDK metric be im-
plemented in hospital clinical microbiology labs. This
would enable efficient classification of bacterial strains as
tolerant, resistant, or persistent (4,17), and thereby provide
a typical timescale for clinical implementation of effective
treatment of tolerant strains.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Media, chemicals, and growth conditions
Unless otherwise specified, measurements were conducted at 37�C in LB
Lennox medium supplemented with 6.25 mg/mL Chloramphenicol.
KLY-derived strains were grown overnight and stored at �80�C with
15% glycerol.
MGY-derived strains were grown in M9 Minimal Salts, 5� (Difco M9;
Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) 0.1% casamino acids, and kept
at �80�C with 15% glycerol.
All strains were diluted at least four orders of magnitude before inocula-
tion (as required to reach 1000 CFU/well in the MDK99.9 test or 100 CFU/
well in the MDK99 test).
Robotic setup
A Freedom EVOware 75 base unit (Tecan, M€
annedorf, Switzerland) was
enclosed in a laminar flow hood equipped with a HEPA filter. An 8
Plus 1 liquid handling arm (Tecan) and a RoMa-3 EVO 75 arm (Tecan)
were used for pipetting and plate handling. Plates were incubated in a
Storex 40 Incubator (Liconic, Woburn, MA) with a shaking option, and
culture was kept at 2–3�C on a chill/heat plate (Torrey Pines Scientific,
Carlsbad, CA).
Detailed protocol for measuring MDK
The protocol proposed here for measuring tolerance may be automated
easily (as we have done), and is a better quantitative indicator of tolerance
than existing methods, as will be explained at length in the Results. The pro-
tocol exposes populations of bacteria to different concentrations of antibi-
otics for varied time periods, and the presence or lack of survivors
(regrowth) is used to determine the MDK.
Preparation. A 96-microwell plate is filled with antibiotics in concentra-
tions decreasing exponentially with the column. The final column is left
antibiotic free, as a control for growth. It should be noted that if the MIC
is known (approximately), concentrations below and around it need not
be measured. Concentrations should typically reach at least 20� MIC. If
the MIC can only be estimated, even up to an order of magnitude, it is advis-
able to spread concentrations over a wider range, to reach the range where
killing is concentration independent.
FIGURE 1
Shown here are time-kill curves under ampicillin treatment of
two strains with different tolerance levels. The tolerant strain (tbl5a) was
evolved from the ancestral strain (KLY) under intermittent ampicillin expo-
sure (12). The MIC of both strains is the same, but the tolerant strain is
killed at a significantly reduced rate. The slower killing is reflected in the
MDK99, i.e., the time to kill 99% of the population, or Survival ¼ 10�2.

 Bacteria inocula are diluted to the concentration corresponding to the
MDK being measured, so that treatment durations longer than the MDK
(time) will result in eradication of the population without regrowth. For
example: to determine the MDK99, 100 bacteria per well are required; to
determine the MDK99.9, 103 bacteria should be added to each well; etc.
The mean number of bacteria in the inocula, N, is evaluated by serial dilu-
tion and plating.
To maintain viability and metabolic state of the bacteria over time, bac-
teria are stored in NaCl solution at 2–3�C. We verified that these conditions
do not alter the level of tolerance in our strains. Note that, because the phys-
iological state of the bacteria is often key to their tolerance, the details of the
preparation of the bacterial culture should be carefully determined, depend-
ing on the form of tolerance to be measured. For example, tolerance-by-lag,
measured in this work, depends on the lag time of the bacteria and therefore
on the growth conditions of the culture before the MDK measurement; cul-
tures grown without adequate shaking, or for too short a time, do not reach a
uniform metabolic state. Standardized conditions were chosen, to ensure
the entire population reaches stationary phase (Appendix A in the Support-
ing Material). Measurement of tolerance by slow growth would also depend
upon the growth conditions before the measurement but, unlike tolerance-
by-lag, would be best carried out from a strictly exponential culture, such as
a chemostat culture.
Inoculation-incubation cycle. The plate is inoculated, one row at a time,
at set time intervals, and returned to incubation and shaking at 750 rpm. If
the MDK is not known at all, a wide exponential timescale should be used.
Subsequent assays with a narrower range of inoculation times may be
required for accurate MDK determination.
Plates should be allowed to reach 37�C before the first inoculation.
Antibiotic wash. Once inoculation and incubation of all rows have been
concluded, it is necessary to wash away the antibiotic remains. In the case
of ampicillin, b-lactamase is added to all wells at a final concentration of
0.5 unit/mL. Alternatively, two spin-downs are required to reach sub-
MIC antibiotic levels in all wells. Each spin-down is 10 min at 1200 g to
minimize stress on surviving cells. This procedure is repeated twice, as
each spin-down is equivalent to a 10–20-fold dilution, and the highest anti-
biotic concentration used may be as large as 100� MIC. In this work, sur-
face-treated plates with U-shaped wells were used (Cat. No. 163320;
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). A model No. 5810R centrifuge
(Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) was used with a multiwell-plate adaptor,
and supernatant was discarded manually. The centrifugation was performed
at 10�C, for historical reasons.
Final incubation and results. Finally, the plate is incubated overnight
with shaking (longer incubation periods may be required for slow-growing
strains). Results may be read directly from the plate, as will be discussed, by
looking at the high-concentration end, and determining the time at which
the treatment becomes too long for the survival of even a single bacterium.
Determination of MIC and growth rate
MIC was determined by inoculation of bacteria into a 96-microwell plate
containing growth medium with different concentrations of antibiotic in
different wells, and incubation overnight (1) (24 h for high-tolerance
strains).
Maximal growth rate was estimated by measuring the optical density of
batch culture over time, although an order-of-magnitude estimate is suffi-
cient for the purpose of this test (Appendix B in the Supporting Material).
RESULTS
The MDK as a measure of tolerance
We now begin with a brief formal definition of the MDK,
which captures the typical time required to kill a bacterial
population. The MDK can be defined using the survival
function S(C,t), which is the fraction of surviving bacteria
after antibiotic exposure at a concentration C and duration t,
and may be visualized as a surface (Fig. 2 a). Various sur-
vival functions have been proposed for capturing the effect
of bactericidal antibiotics, either from phenomenological or
molecular models. The definition of the MDK is indepen-
dent of the specific model function, as long as the antibi-
otic’s efficacy reaches saturation at sufficiently high
concentrations. This is true for many antibiotics, and is im-
plicit in Emax models, which are commonly used for math-
ematical description of time-kill curves (18–20). Thus, at
high enough concentrations, S(C,t) is weakly concentration
dependent. For antibiotics that do not fulfill this property
(10), the MDK is not relevant. The contour plot of the sur-
face in Fig. 2 a is shown in Fig. 2 b, and the contour lines

tion of antibiotic concentration (C) and treatment duration (t). Survival is

tion) of the contour line S(C,t) ¼ 0.01. To see this figure in color, go online.

 display both vertical and horizontal asymptotic behavior.
The MDK99 is the horizontal asymptote of the contour
SðC; tÞ ¼ ð1=100Þ (high concentrations), and the vertical
asymptote is the MIC (long treatment durations).
Resistance may be described as a shift in the MIC to
higher drug concentration. Tolerance can be characterized
in a similar manner, by an increase in the MDK (MDK99,
for example), corresponding to survival under longer expo-
sure to antibiotics.
Automated measurement of the MDK
To measure the MDK without generating the entire time-kill
curve, we developed an automated protocol based on multi-
ple probabilistic measurements. We implemented the proto-
col by an automated robotic procedure, but it may also be
performed manually.
We focus initially on MDK99 measurement, namely the
time required to kill 99% of the population. By exposing
many parallel populations of �100 bacteria each to
different
concentrations
for
different
durations,
it
is
possible to extract the MDK99 by observing the overall
outcome, i.e., whether there were any survivors or not after
the antibiotic was removed. This is reminiscent of the
method of most probable number (21), where bacteria are
serially diluted to concentrations above and below one bac-
terium (on average) per isolated growth medium, and then
observation of the growth/no-growth pattern allows deter-
mination of CFU in the original culture. Our protocol for
measuring the MDK99 consists of the following steps
(Fig.3). First, a 96-microwell plate is prepared, in which
the concentration of antibiotic varies exponentially with
the column (Fig. 3 a). Antibiotic containing rows are inoc-
ulated with bacteria at different preset times (see Materials
and Methods; Fig. 3, c and d). Inoculation times are set so
that all rows end their respective treatment at the same
time. Once incubation is concluded, the plate is spun
down to terminate the antibiotic exposure by washing
away antibiotic remains and resuspending in fresh medium.
The result of this protocol is a grid of 96 different concen-
tration-duration pairs, to each of which �100 bacteria have
been exposed. The plate is then returned for overnight in-
cubation. Empty wells indicate killing of >99% of the pop-
ulation, because growth in the well would imply that at
least one bacterium, out of the 100 at t ¼ 0, survived the
treatment (see Appendix A in the Supporting Material).
The interface between the growth and no-growth areas is
therefore the contour SðC; tÞ ¼ ð1=100Þ. For most antibi-
otics, the effectiveness of the drug reaches saturation at
high concentrations (18), as mentioned. This can be seen
in Fig. 3 f, where at high enough concentrations, the
pattern reaches a plateau, indicating that the dynamics
are weakly dependent on concentration in this regime.
This is the regime by which tolerance is defined. A rough
evaluation of MDK99 can be read directly from the plate—
it is the treatment duration at which the plateau forms
(dashed red line in Fig. 3, e and f). The experimental eval-
uation for the strain shown in Fig. 3 f is �2.5 h, in agree-
ment with the time-kill curve of the same strain (Fig. 1).
A more precise evaluation of the MDK99 may be achieved
using the entire growth/no-growth pattern, as explained
below.
Maximum likelihood estimation of MDK
The span of concentrations (C) and times (t) in the experi-
mental protocol allows for the direct visualization of the
S(C,t) ¼ 0.01 curve and a rough estimate of the asymptotic
behavior. The MDK99 can be directly (albeit, roughly) as-
sessed by looking at the duration of exposure that prevents
growth at high concentrations. For example, for the strain
in Fig. 4 a (KLY), this duration is �3 h under ampicillin.
This semiquantitative estimation can be improved by using
a more precise evaluation of the MDK99, which takes into
account the inherent probabilistic nature of our measure-
ments and yields a result of 3.2 5 0.7, in the case of
Fig. 4 a. This approach has three phases: assuming a para-
metric form to model the function S(C, t; a); extracting
maximum likelihood estimates a0 for the parameters from
the empirical data; and, finally, calculating the MDK from
the function S(C, t; a). The common choice for S(C,t)
is the Zhi model (19)—a time-exponential distribution,
where the dependence of the killing rate on concentration
is usually taken to be a (decreasing) Hill function (18). To
calculate the likelihood, one needs to express the probability
of observing growth in a well in terms of the survival func-
tion, because the independent trials in this case are the indi-
vidual wells. Assuming each bacterium’s fate is independent
of the others in the well, the probability of at least one sur-
vivor in a well can be readily expressed. The survival prob-
ability is denoted S(C,t), so the probability of at least one
survivor, P(C,t), is 1 minus that of all N bacteria in the
well dying, as follows:
PðC; tÞ ¼ 1 � ð1 � SðC; tÞÞN:
(1)
Using Eq. 1 as a model function for the observations, the
log-likelihood is a sum of log-likelihoods in individual
wells, and can be fitted to the data. It is important to empha-
size that this approach is not restricted to a large population
size, because it models the probability of regrowth, rather
than the surviving population size. The effect of Poisson
fluctuations in the number of bacteria per well is discussed
in Appendix B in the Supporting Material.
Measurement of the MDK99 in tolerant strains
To demonstrate that the MDK measurement can discrimi-
nate between different tolerance levels, we implemented
the above protocol in a robotic setup and compared the

 MDK99 of a tolerant mutant (Fig. 4 b) isolated in an evolu-
tion experiment under ampicillin treatment (12) to the
MDK99 of the ancestral strain (Fig. 4 a). Both strains have
identical MIC (12). The comparison between the two
MDKs is clear—the MDK99 of the ancestral strain is
3.2 5 0.7 h, whereas that of the evolved tolerant strain
(tbl5a) is 20 5 2 h.
As a test of reproducibility, the MDKs were measured at
least 10 times in independent, single-plate experiments (see
Table 1).
We conclude that the automated measurement of the
MDK99 provides valuable quantitative information concern-
ing the tolerance level of strains, without the need to
conduct labor-intensive kill curves.
Measurement of the MDK in persistent strains
Persistence that is due to a subpopulation of tolerant bacte-
ria, namely a subpopulation that is killed more slowly than
the majority population, may also be evaluated with the
MDK measurement. If the strain is a high persistence strain
with a subpopulation of persister cells >1%, the MDK99
measurements will detect the slow killing. Therefore, the
MDK99 will enable detection of tolerance of such strains,
as shown in Fig. 5 b, where the measurement of MDK99
of the hipA7 (22) high persistence mutant (MGHY) is
shown. On the other hand, a strain containing <0.01%
persisters, will have a MDK99 identical to that of a nonper-
sistent strain, and persisters may be detected only by
measuring higher MDKs, such as MDK99.9 or MDK99.99

 (i.e., duration for killing 99.9% or 99.99%, respectively).
For example, the wild-type Escherichia coli has a typical
persistence level of 10�3 and this low level of persistence
is not apparent in its MDK99 (2.1 5 0.2 h). However, the
measurement of MDK99.9 reveals a longer timescale.
From simple arguments (see Appendix B in the Support-
ing Material), it can be seen that in the absence of persis-
tence, the ratio between MDK99.9 and MDK99, should
be �3/2. Therefore, the MDK99.9 of wild-type E. coli would
be 2:1 � ð3=2Þz3 h. Fig. 5 d compares the expected
MDK99.9 of wild-type E. coli, based on the MDK99
(Fig. 5 a), to the MDK99.9 measured for this strain
(Fig. 5 c), revealing the biphasic time-kill curve typical
of persistence.
We note that our measurements can also provide another
way to detect persistence: in the area of the plate in which no
growth is supposed to occur (higher (C,t) pairs), growth will
appear in many wells, depending on the persister fraction,
reflecting the stochastic occurrence of persisters in each
well (see Appendix B in the Supporting Material).
DISCUSSION
The framework suggested above, in which the MDK is a
metric for tolerance, bears several advantages over previous
methods. Its definition as a duration is natural, as tolerance
is the ability to survive transient exposure to stress. There-
fore, the MDK has an inherent advantage over minimum
bactericidal concentration/MIC ratios (23), which have
been shown to be poorly correlated with tolerance (6,24–
26) (minimum bactericidal concentration—the concentra-
tion required to kill R99.9% of a culture, typically after
24 h incubation). Another option typically used to evaluate
tolerance is time-kill curve analysis. However, quantitative
parameters that can be compared between experiments are
rarely extracted from time-kill curves. Another major disad-
vantage, apart from the labor-intensive protocol, is that a
time-kill curve is often measured at a single concentration.
This is problematic because a decrease in lethality of an
antibiotic, possibly due to increased MIC, might be misin-
terpreted as tolerance. Here, we present an alternative auto-
mated protocol for easily measuring the MDK99 of a strain
without the labor-intensive time-kill curve.
It is advisable to take a number of practical considerations
into account when using the MDK protocol. First and fore-
most, MDK is sensitive to growth conditions, just as MIC
and time-kill curves are, because the lethality in most anti-
biotics is strongly dependent upon growth rate, which, in
turn, is directly influenced by the environment and meta-
bolic state (27). A change in medium temperature, or its
composition, may cause a significant increase in MDK.
Obviously, the MDK is sensitive to the precise initial
inoculum size; however, as the dependence is approximately
logarithmic, in cases where there is a slight deviation from a
mean of 100 bacteria per well, a simple extrapolation may
be used to obtain the desired MDK from the measured re-
sults (see Appendix B in the Supporting Material).
It is important to note that the correct choice of treat-
ment duration and concentration ranges is significant. For
maximal accuracy of measurement, the concentration range
should include sufficiently high concentrations to observe a
plateau of killing—a range of concentrations in which the
killing rate is constant. The treatment durations should be
long enough, so that for most concentrations used there
will be both growth and no-growth.
One more problem that occasionally needs to be ad-
dressed, especially in long measurements, is the effect of
FIGURE 4

ampicillin, using the protocol in Fig. 3. A sensitive ancestral strain
(KLY) (a) is compared to a tolerant strain (tbl5a) evolved from this strain

Appendix B in the Supporting Material). Note that the concentration depen-
dence is not apparent in these data, due to the low time resolution. To see

 extended periods of waiting time on the conditions of the
measurement. This may cause a change in the metabolic
state of the bacteria awaiting inoculation and affect the re-
sults (even though they are on ice; see Materials and
Methods). We ascertained by testing that the waiting time
has no significant influence on the MDK99 results in our
strains (see Appendix A in the Supporting Material). For
strains that may be influenced by the duration on ice, the
protocol can be adapted to sample bacteria directly from a
culture in physiological conditions. This would require the
robotic setup to maintain such a culture in constant condi-
tions over time. Other possible pitfalls, common to time-
kill experiments, are the significant degradation of antibiotic
before inoculation, which can reduce the antibiotic’s effec-
tiveness, or evaporation of the medium, which may increase
the effective antibiotic concentration. We note, however,
that the MDK test is not sensitive to the precise antibiotic
concentration, provided it is high enough to reach satura-
tion. These effects can be corrected for, simply by adjusting
the concentration of antibiotic used for the different time
points.
CONCLUSION
With these caveats, the MDK provides a fairly simple and
robust measure of tolerance to antimicrobials, and provides
a timescale to the problem of combating infection or
contamination. We have tested this protocol on several
strains, under several antibiotics, and have obtained consis-
tent results (see Appendix C in the Supporting Material). We
hope that the clear definition and probabilistic measurement
protocol that we suggest will aid the comparison of results
