ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To estimate the regression, persistence, and 
progression of untreated cervical intraepithelial 
neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) lesions managed 
conservatively as well as compliance with follow-up 
protocols.
DESIGN
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES
Medline, Embase, and the Cumulative Index to 
Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) from 1 
January 1973 to 20 August 2016.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
Studies reporting on outcomes of histologically 
confirmed CIN2 in non-pregnant women, managed 
conservatively for three or more months.
DATA SYNTHESIS
Two reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of 
bias. Random effects model was used to calculate 
pooled proportions for each outcome, and 
heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistics.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Rates of regression, persistence, or progression of 
CIN2 and default rates at different follow-up time 
points (3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months).
RESULTS
36 studies that included 3160 women were identified 
(seven randomised trials, 16 prospective cohorts, 
and 13 retrospective cohorts; 50% of the studies 
were at low risk of bias). At 24 months, the pooled 
rates were 50% (11 studies, 819/1470 women, 
95% confidence interval 43% to 57%; I2=77%) for 
regression, 32% (eight studies, 334/1257 women, 
23% to 42%; I2=82%) for persistence, and 18% (nine 
studies, 282/1445 women, 11% to 27%; I2=90%) 
for progression. In a subgroup analysis including 
1069 women aged less than 30 years, the rates were 
60% (four studies, 638/1069 women, 57% to 63%; 
I2=0%), 23% (two studies, 226/938 women, 20% to 
26%; I2=97%), and 11% (three studies, 163/1033 
women, 5% to 19%; I2=67%), respectively. The rate of 
non-compliance (at six to 24 months of follow-up) in 
prospective studies was around 10%.
CONCLUSIONS
Most CIN2 lesions, particularly in young women (<30 
years), regress spontaneously. Active surveillance, 
rather than immediate intervention, is therefore 
justified, especially among young women who are 
likely to adhere to monitoring.

Introduction
Organised cervical cancer screening has led to a 
noticeable reduction in the incidence of and mortality 
from invasive cervical cancer, as pre-invasive lesions 
(cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, CIN) can be 
detected and treated appropriately.1 2 Low grade 
squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL, also known as 
CIN1) is now recognised as a histological diagnosis 
of benign viral replication that should be managed 
conservatively, whereas CIN3 is recognised as a true 
pre-invasive precursor with a potential to progress to 
cancer. The clinical course and biological behaviour of 
CIN2 is less well understood.
Histological diagnosis of CIN2 or worse on a biopsy 
sample has been considered the cut-off point to 
proceed to treatment. Approximately 1.5 per 1000 
women in developed countries are diagnosed as having 
CIN2/3 annually and the incidence is highest among 
women aged between 25 and 29 years—that is, 8.1 per 
1000 women.3 Awareness that CIN2 is an equivocal 
histological diagnosis is increasing, and some studies 
have documented high spontaneous regression rates, 
particularly in young women.4 5 In a prospective cohort 
study among 95 women aged 18 to 23, the regression 
rate was 63%, while only 15% of women progressed to

WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
The clinical course of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) is not well 
established
CIN2 on a colposcopically directed cervical biopsy has been considered the 
clinical cut-off to proceed to treatment
Some studies, however, have suggested that spontaneous regression rates 
may be high; this could be especially important for women of reproductive age 
because local treatments can be harmful for future pregnancies
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
Half of untreated CIN2 lesions (50%) regress spontaneously and one in five 
(18%) progress to CIN3 or worse within two years of surveillance—the rates are 
60% and 11% in women aged less than 30 
Among more than 3000 women, there were only 13 stage 1A1 (0.4%) and two 
more advanced (0.06%) invasive cases, most in women older than 30

CIN3 within three years.6 In another prospective cohort 
of 5052 women aged 18 to 62, 40% of CIN2 lesions 
regressed within two years,7 whereas the regression 
rate of CIN3 has been estimated to be around 32% 
and the progression to invasive cancer as high as 
12%.8 Despite evidence on differences in the clinical 
course of CIN2 and CIN3, the updated World Health 
Organization 2014 histopathological classification 
graded these lesions as a single entity: high grade 
squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL).9
CIN2 and CIN3 are often treated with local excision 
of the cervix, which has proved to be effective.10 
However, cervical treatment increases the risk of 
preterm birth and mid-trimester loss for women who 
go on to conceive after treatment.11-16 As women 
undergoing local treatment for CIN are often of similar 
age as women having their first child, it is important to 
avoid overtreatment.
The high regression rates of CIN2 in some studies 
together with the morbidity associated with treatment 
has led to the adoption of alternative conservative 
management strategies in adolescent and young 
women. To date, however, no systematic reviews have 
explored the clinical course of histologically confirmed 
CIN2 lesions monitored conservatively. We performed 
a systematic review and meta-analysis on regression, 
progression, and persistence rates and adherence to 
follow-up in women with histologically confirmed 
CIN2 lesions managed with active surveillance.
Methods
Eligibility criteria and outcome measures
We included original studies that reported on outcomes 
of women with histologically proved CIN2 who were not 
treated at diagnosis, were monitored for three or more 
months, and had a diagnosis available at the end of 
the study period. We preferred histology to cytology for 
the diagnosis of the disease grade during the follow-up 
period; if histology was not available—particularly in 
the case of normal findings—we accepted the cytological 
diagnosis. We excluded studies on pregnant or women 
positive for antibodies to HIV, studies including fewer 
than 10 patients to complete surveillance, studies not 
defining the length of the follow-up period or merging 
CIN2 with another histological diagnosis (CIN1 or 
CIN3), and studies not published in English.
We explored disease outcomes for different time 
points that included regression (CIN1 or less), 
persistence (CIN2), and progression rates (CIN3 or 
worse). Furthermore, we explored the rate of non-
compliance with active surveillance. The studies were 
broadly grouped and analysed based on the length of 
surveillance (3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months). These 
time points were based on the exact follow-up or the 
median or mean follow-up time. The outcome data 
were then included in the follow-up time point closest 
to the reported mean or median value.
Literature search and data extraction
We searched three databases (Medline, Embase, and 
the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
Literature (CINAHL)) for publications between 1 
January 1973 (when CIN grading was introduced)17 
and 20 August 2016 (see supplementary file for details 
of the search strategy). We also hand searched the 
reference lists of all included studies.
From each study we extracted data on progression, 
persistence, and regression rates as well as the first 
author, year of publication, the design and setting, 
geographical region, the total number of participants, 
the number of participants with the outcomes of 
interest at different time points, and the number of 
participants with high risk human papillomavirus 
(HrHPV) or HPV16/18, or both at the beginning of 
follow-up, if available.
We 
accepted 
the 
definition 
of 
progression, 
persistence, and regression used in each study, 
recognising that there would be heterogeneity 
in definitions across studies. The regression and 
persistence definitions were classified into two broad 
groups: strict or lenient. We defined strict regression 
criteria as cytological and/or histological regression to 
normal, and lenient criteria as any regressive disease 
to cytological and/or histological diagnosis to atypical 
squamous cells of unknown significance (ASC-US) 
and to low grade squamous cervical intraepithelial 
lesion (LSIL). The strict persistence criterion included 
cytological or histological persistence of ASC-US, LSIL, 
or CIN2, whereas for the lenient criterion we considered 
only histological CIN2 and/or cytological high grade 
squamous cervical intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and 
atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H).
Risk of bias assessment
We assessed the risk of bias using a modified version 
of the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool 
(see supplementary table 1). We evaluated each 
study according to five criteria: representativeness 
of population, assessment of exposure, presence of 
the outcome at the start of study, assessment of the 
outcome, and loss to follow-up. For each criterion we 
judged studies to have either a high risk or a low risk 
of bias. We classified studies at high risk of bias overall 
if at least one criterion was at high risk of bias. We 
defined loss to follow-up as the number of women lost 
to follow-up in prospective studies and as the number 
of initially eligible participants with missing data in 
retrospective cohort studies.
Two 
investigators 
independently 
performed 
literature searches, data extraction, and risk of 
bias assessment in duplicate. Disagreements were 
resolved by discussion and, if required, consensus 
was reached with the involvement of a third 
investigator. We registered the protocol (PROSPERO 
2014: CRD42014014406) and followed the preferred 
reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-
analysis guidance (PRISMA).18
Data synthesis and assessment of heterogeneity
We defined regression, persistence, progression, 
and default rates as the ratio of observed number of 
women with a given outcome divided by the number

of women attending in that follow-up time point. In 
case a single study presented more than one definition 
for an outcome, we used the most stringent definition 
given in the main analyses. Using the metaprop 
command in STATA19 we meta-analysed pooled 
proportions separately at the 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 
month follow-up for each outcome. We used the exact 
binomial score test-based confidence intervals with 
the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine method to stabilise 
the variances for individual studies, in which many of 
the proportions were close to or at the margins of the 
possible interval (0 or 100%).19
The heterogeneity between studies was assessed 
with the I2 metric of inconsistency.20 If at least 10 
studies were included in the meta-analysis, we used 
visual inspection of funnel plots and the Egger’s 
regression asymmetry test (P<0.10)21 to examine the 
possible presence of small study effects.
To explore the possible differences in summary 
estimates, we performed a single predefined sensitivity 
analysis 
using 
the 
lenient 
criteria 
(predefined 
hypothesis of higher regression and lower persistence 
rates than when using the strict criteria). To explore 
the possible sources of heterogeneity, we performed 
four predefined sensitivity analyses all with predefined 
hypothesis of reduced heterogeneity: including only 
the same uniform outcome definition criteria across 
all studies, including only studies with strictly defined 
follow-up time points, including only prospective 
studies, and including only low risk of bias studies. 
To further explore the sources of heterogeneity and 
the possible differences in summary estimates, we 
additionally performed subgroup analyses according to 
continent and the decade when the study was performed 
(to explore heterogeneity by differing diagnostics in 
different periods and different geographical locations), 
according to the age range (only ≤30 years, and studies 
with only ≤30 years excluded, respectively) and median 
age (≤30 years and >30 years), expecting to see more 
frequent regression and less frequent progression 
in younger patients, and according to the baseline 
HrHPV (positive or negative) or HPV16/18 (positive 
or negative) status of the women, expecting to see less 
frequent regression and more frequent progression in 
women positive for HrHPV or HPV16/18.
All analyses were performed in STATA version 13 
(StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in the design, development 
of outcome measures, or conduct of the study. The 
results will be disseminated to the lay audience 
through the authors’ involvement with charities and 
through public presentations.
Results
We identified 250 potentially eligible studies; 43 
publications met the inclusion criteria (fig 1),6 22-63 but 
seven were duplicate reports of the same data.27 28 31 40 
50 52 54 Of the 36 eligible studies (total of 3160 women), 
seven (19%) were randomised trials with suitable 
data in the non-experimental arm,22 25 33 39 45 57 62 16 
(44%) were prospective cohort studies,6 26 30 32 34-38 41 
43 51 55 56 60 63 and 13 (36%) were retrospective cohort 
studies23 24 29 42 44 46-49 53 58 59 61 (see supplementary 
table 2). The median follow-up was 16 months (range 
3-72, interquartile range 7.6-27.4 months). The largest 
study included 924 women and the smallest included 
12 women. Most studies (n=29, 81%) were small, 
with fewer than 100 women, and seven (19%) studies 
included only women aged less than 25.6 29 42 44 48 
49 53 Twenty nine (81%) studies defined progression 
as a histological diagnosis of CIN3 or worse, whereas 
in seven of the 36 (19%) studies, worsening cytology 
was considered sufficient. Twenty five studies (69%) 
defined regression as normal histology or cytology, 
or both, whereas 17 (47%) considered that biopsy 
confirmed CIN1 or cytology suggestive of ASC-US 
or LSIL represented a regressive CIN2 lesion. Six 
(16%) studies reported results using both definitions 
(“complete” and “partial regression”) or provided 
the individual data on all cytology and histology 
outcomes. The number of studies reporting outcomes 
at different time points varied: 7 (19%) provided data 
at six months, 17 (47%) at 12 months, 14 (39%) at 
24 months, 7 (19%) at 36 months, and 6 (17%) at 60 
months. Data stratified according to the presence of 
HPV at baseline were available in 11 (31%) studies, 
but the follow-up time points and methods to define 
the presence of HPV varied between studies.
Eighteen of the 36 (50%) studies met the criteria 
for high risk of bias (see supplementary table 3). The 
most common causes for high risk of bias were loss to 
follow-up (n=14, 78%) and assessment of the outcome 
(n=5, 28%). A follow-up protocol was reported in 
32 studies (see supplementary table 2). Colposcopy 
was routinely performed at every follow-up visit in at 
least 20 out of 36 studies. Biopsy samples were taken 
routinely at least once during the follow-up in five 
studies, and for histological confirmation of lesions 
even if they were not suspected to be CIN3 or worse in 
five studies. The protocols varied greatly between the 
studies, and of the 32 studies reporting the protocol, 
the definite criteria for colposcopic evaluation or 
histological sampling during the follow-up could not 
be defined in 11 studies. In the prospective, low risk 
of bias studies,22 25 26 30 31 33 35-38 43 47 51 56 57 63 the most 
typical protocols included cytology and colposcopy 
every three to four months, with routine biopsies or 
biopsies when progression was suspected.
Progression, persistence, and regression rates
The regression rate for histologically confirmed CIN2 
lesions was high at all time points (table 1, fig 2, and 
supplementary table 4). The rate at 12 months was 46% 
(13 studies, 300/628 women, 95% confidence interval 
36% to 56%; I2=81%) and at 24 months was 50% (11 
studies, 819/1470 women, 43% to 57%; I2=77%). The 
number of studies for the remaining time points was 
smaller. At the extremes of surveillance (three months 
and 60 months), the regression rates were 42% (six 
studies, 97/208 women, 24% to 61%; I2=86%) and

44% (three studies, 70/170 women, 24% to 66%; 
I2=86%), respectively. Interstudy heterogeneity was 
substantial at all follow-up time points.
The progression rate to CIN3 or worse increased 
with time (table 1, fig 3, and supplementary table 6). 
The rate was as low as 5% at three months (three 
studies, 7/133 women, 2% to 10%; I2=0%) and 
progressively increased from 14% at 12 months (13 
studies, 131/834 women, 9% to 20%; I2=75%) to 18% 
at 24 months (nine studies, 282/1445 women, 11% to 
27%; I2=90%) and 24% at 36 months (three studies, 
105/370 women, 12% to 39%; I2=87%). Among the 
3160 women, a total of 15 cases (0.5%, 15/3160) of 
cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia (cGIN; 
British Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology 
classification—also known as adenocarcinoma in situ, 
AIS; Bethesda classification) were diagnosed during 
the follow-up period.42 53 55 Fifteen cases of invasive 
cervical disease occurred (0.5%, 15/3160); 13 of 
stage 1A1 (0.4%, 13/3160) and two of more advanced 
invasive disease (0.06%, 2/3160).23 36 37 39
The pooled persistence rate at three months was 
47% (three studies, 56/145 women, 16% to 79%; 
I2=93%). The rate decreased but remained stable at 
around 30% for the remaining time points (table 1, 
supplementary table 5): 29% (nine studies, 110/414 
women, 17% to 43%; I2=85%) at 12 months and 
32% (eight studies, 334/1257 women, 23% to 42%; 
I2=82%) at 24 months.
Default rates
The rate of non-compliance, including missing data in 
retrospective studies, was 19% (five studies, 69/316 
women, 7% to 35%; I2=88%) at six months, 15% 
(nine studies, 120/564 women, 6% to 25%; I2=87%) 
at 12 months, and reduced to 8% (six studies, 61/439 
women, 1% to 21%; I2=92%) at 24 months (see 
supplementary table 7).
Small study effects
Three (3/24, 13%) analyses (progression rate at 12 
months and regression rates at 12 and 24 months) 
included 10 or more studies for visual inspection of 
funnel plots and the Egger’s test to have sufficient 
statistical power. Of these, the progression rate at 12 
months showed evidence of the presence of small

study effects (Egger’s test, P=0.01, 13 studies and 
funnel plot asymmetry).
Sensitivity and subgroup analyses
We performed a series of sensitivity and subgroup 
analyses that mostly supported the results of the main 
analysis (see supplementary tables 4-7). By including 
only studies at low risk of bias, the heterogeneity 
continued to be high, whereas including only 
prospective studies and globally strict assessment of 
outcomes decreased heterogeneity in all outcomes 
but persistence. This is likely explained by varying 
diagnostic criteria in the literature and the temporal 
nature of the studied outcomes. Default rates in 
prospective cohort studies were around 10%, whereas 
in retrospective cohort studies (based on hospital 
registries and including potentially more women with 
missing data) as high as more than 20% for six months 
and 12 months.
The regression rates were higher and progression 
rates lower in women aged less than 30 years. Similarly, 
there was less heterogeneity with age stratification. 
The regression rate in women aged less than 30 was 
60% at 24 months of surveillance (four studies, 
638/1069 women, 57% to 63%; I2=0%) and peaked at 
70% at 36 months (two studies, 92/131 women, 62% 
to 78%; I2=61%). The progression rate at 24 months 
was 11% (three studies 163/1033 women, 5% to 
19%; I2=67%). In contrast, when we included studies 
in women older than 30, at 24 months the regression 
rate was 44% (seven studies, 181/401 women, 36% to 
52%; I2=61%) and progression rate 23% (six studies, 
119/412 women, 12% to 37%; I2=89%).
Women who were HrHPV and HPV16/18 negative 
at baseline had lower risk of progression at 24 months 
(3%, three studies, 1/23 women, 0% to 24%; I2=0%, 
and 5%, two studies, 1/62 women, 0% to 28%; 
I2=76%, respectively) than HrHPV or HPV16/18 
positive women (25%, three studies, 38/161 women 
14% to 38%; I2=51%, and 21%, two studies, 7/56 
women, 8% to 37%; I2=58%, respectively). However, 
most of both HrHPV and HPV16/18 negative and 
positive women experienced regression within two 
years. Other studied factors in subgroup and sensitivity 
analyses did not noticeably affect the results.
discussion
Our results show that active surveillance is justified 
in selected women with untreated, histologically 
confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 
(CIN2) lesions, particularly if they are young and the 
likelihood of compliance with follow-up is high.
Approximately half of the CIN2 lesions will regress 
after two years and just under one fifth will progress. 
In 1000 women aged less than 30 with a diagnosis of 
CIN2, 600 will experience regression, 230 will remain 
unchanged, and 110 will progress within two years of 
active surveillance. Out of the lesions that have more 
advanced disease at the end of the surveillance, the 
majority progress to CIN3, 5 in a 1000 have cervical 
glandular intraepithelial neoplasia (cGIN), and

invasive cancer is rare (5 in 1000 in women of all 
ages; 0.6 in 1000 women if stage 1A1 is excluded). 
The risk of progression was particularly low in women 
negative for high risk human papillomavirus (HrHPV) 
or HPV16/18 at baseline, whereas for those who tested 
positive, the regression rate was 40% at two years. 
Adherence to follow-up was around 90% up to two 
years in prospective reports, which are most likely to 
report on true estimates. These estimates are helpful in 
shared decision making when deciding between active 
surveillance and immediate intervention.
Strengths and limitations of this review
We conducted a systematic appraisal of the published 
literature on the oncological outcomes of women with 
untreated CIN2 lesions and the rate of compliance 
with surveillance. By meta-analysing the rates of 
progression and regression and this study provides 
clinicians and women current best estimates of the 
different patient important outcomes to assist shared 
decision making. The strengths of our study include 
the 
comprehensive 
literature 
search, 
duplicate 
assessment of eligibility and data abstraction, 
and appraisal of risk of bias. We used appropriate 
statistical methods to generate pooled estimates and 
explored possible sources of heterogeneity. We only 
used studies that had a histological confirmation of 
the initial grade of the disease, thereby decreasing the 
risk of misclassification bias. Although cytology has 
been used in some studies, we considered those to be 
unsuitable for inclusion as sensitivity of cytology is 
even lower than that of histology and the interobserver 
and interstudy variability are high.64
Our results should be interpreted with caution, 
however, because heterogeneity was substantial 
(I2>75%: 18/24, 75%) for most of the outcomes 
assessed. Although we performed a series of sensitivity 
and subgroup analyses, heterogeneity was still 
considerable, possibly as a result of the inherent 
difficulty in classifying lesions as CIN2. Grading 
of CIN, based on the thickness of the lesion in the 
epithelium, varies noticeably between observers.64-66 
Misclassification of lesions affects the findings of our 
study and is a recognised problem in clinical practice. 
Here, the progression rate at six months in women aged 
less than 30 years was as high as 18% (three studies, 
37/205 women, 12% to 23%; I2=0%) and was likely 
due to initial misclassification of a CIN3 lesion as CIN2. 
Despite the observed heterogeneity and even bias 
resulting from possible misclassification of lesions, the 
rates of regression were still high in young women even 
at the most conservative estimates.
The inclusion and exclusion criteria varied greatly 
across the original studies, which on the one hand 
might increase the applicability of the results, and 
on the other hand might have affected the selection 
of women with CIN2 lesions to be treated with active 
surveillance. This would therefore have introduced 
bias. Most of the included studies included a variety of 
histological grades, and only 11 out of the 36 included 
women purely with CIN2 lesions with prespecific 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most retrospective 
studies (n=13) did not have robust inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. Only five studies reported refusal 
rates. Furthermore, the description of several other 
factors that could have affected regression of the 
disease was not well documented. For instance, the

use of condoms and other contraceptive techniques 
was reported only in some but not all studies. Only one 
cohort study provided data on the effect of condom 
use on any of the outcomes of interest of our review; 
condom use promoted regression in this study.51
Some studies provided separate outcomes on the 
outcome measures for all time points, whereas others 
only reported cumulative rates of the outcomes. 
Although this might have resulted in one outcome being 
included in more than one meta-analysis, this would 
not have affected the interpretation of our findings 
as neither the trend of the outcomes for the different 
follow-up time points nor the overall cumulative rates 
across all follow-up time points were used in the clinical 
interpretation of the data. For instance, the summary 
estimates on default rates should be interpreted with 
caution. The definition of non-compliance and the 
reporting of default rates varied greatly across studies. 
Only a few reported cumulative default rates at each 
time point. However, our estimate is likely to be true, 
because when we included only prospective studies, 
the default rates were still consistently at or below 10% 
and did not defer substantially from the overall rates.
Furthermore, we were unable to perform subgroup 
analyses according to how clinical features affect the 
risk of progression or regression (such as size of the 
lesion) as this information was not available in the 
included studies. Also, no randomised trials included 
a comparator group receiving conventional treatment 
with long term follow-up.
Interpretation in light of other evidence
Our pooled rates were 46% for regression and 14% 
for progression at 12 months. A well cited narrative 
review—published a quarter of a century ago—
estimated CIN2 to be more prone to progress: rates 
were 43% for regression and 22% for progression.8 
However, the earlier review included neither a 
weighted meta-analysis nor stratification by age and 
length of follow-up, but estimated pooled overall 
proportions from a wide variety of studies dating 
back to the 1960s, with heterogeneous baseline and 
endpoint criteria. Furthermore, cytology was often 
used to define the grade without rigorous pathology 
review, and inevitably included misclassified higher 
or lower grade disease.8 Finally, as many as 30 new 
studies were published after the earlier review, and 
our comprehensive search strategy also identified 
four additional studies that were reported before the 
publication of the earlier review.8 All these limitations 
decrease certainty of these earlier estimates.
Several 
modelling 
studies 
applied 
complex 
mathematical frameworks to explore the clinical 
course of CIN.67 68 None of these models provided 
data on CIN2 alone as a separate histological entity, 
precluding inclusion in our meta-analysis. Vink and 
colleagues found the 10 year incidence of cervical 
cancer to be 1.6% in women with a diagnosis of 
CIN2/3 and further stratified according to the presence 
of HPV16.67 Their finding is in line with the observed 
cancer incidence in our review. Van Oortmarssen and 
Habbema documented a regression rate for any CIN as 
high as 84% (95% confidence interval 76% to 92%) 
in women aged less than 34, whereas this was only 
around 40% in older women68; these results are also in 
line with our findings.
The safety of monitoring CIN2 disease has been 
questioned, as older reports dating a quarter of a 
century ago documented a risk of invasive progression 
as high as 5%.8 In our analysis, out of 3160 women only 
13 (0.4%) had stage 1A1 disease and two (0.06%) more 
advanced disease, and most of these were diagnosed 
in women aged more than 30 years, although the age 
was not reported in three out of four studies.23 36 37 39 
Older age and surveillance for more than two years 
were common phenomena in the studies documenting 
invasive disease. Indeed, at least seven (47%) of 
these 15 cases were in women aged more than 40. A 
prospective cohort study from Japan (mean age 38.2, 
range 21-62 years) reported two cases of stage 1A1 
disease,37 and a US retrospective cohort study reported 
one case after a median follow-up of five years (range 
1-17 years).23 Neither of these studies specified the 
timing of diagnosis or the age of the women with cancer. 
One case of advanced invasive disease occurred in the 
placebo arm of a randomised controlled trial assessing 
the efficacy of oral β carotene in the treatment of CIN2/3 
within two years and it is unclear whether the original 
histology was CIN2 or CIN3 in the case of invasion.39 
The largest number of invasive cancers, 11 cases, was 
reported in a Japanese prospective study that included 
women with high grade squamous intraepithelial 
lesion (HSIL) cytology, with or without histological 
confirmation of CIN2 and a median follow-up of 26 
months (range 1-108 months).36 Follow-up was based 
on cytological samples obtained every three months, 
and colposcopy and biopsy were only performed if 
CIN3 or worse was suspected, without description of 
when this was in cases of HSIL cytology. These issues, 
however, decrease certainty in the estimates of this 
Japanese study. Unlike overall rates of progression, 
regression, and persistence, the authors did not report 
all cancer cases separately based on histological 
confirmation of diagnosis. Ten of the 11 cancers (91%) 
were stage 1A1 disease and one (9%) was stage 1B1 (<2 
cm). Eight (73%) were diagnosed after histologically 
confirmed as CIN2 lesions, seven of them in women 
aged more than 40, one in women aged 30-40, and 
none in women aged less than 30. It was unclear when 
the diagnoses were made during the follow-up.
In our meta-analysis, 15 (0.5%) cases of cGIN 
occurred among the 3160 women with CIN2. Out of 
these 15 cases, 14 were in women aged less than 25.42 
53 54 In the retrospective cohort study from Australia 
with 924 expectantly managed 18-24 year old women 
with CIN2, eight cases (0.9%) developed cGIN within 
24 months.53 In another retrospective cohort study 
from Canada with 319 women aged less than 25 at the 
time of CIN2 diagnosis and managed either with active 
surveillance or with immediate treatment, overall six 
cases of cGIN (1.9%) were observed within a median 
follow-up of 15 months.42 The authors did not specify

whether the cases occurred in the immediate treatment 
group or in the surveillance group. One case of cGIN 
was reported in a prospective cohort study with a mean 
age of 37.1 (SD 6.4) years.54 The overall incidence of 
cGIN was still very low.
The benefits of active surveillance compared with 
treatment should outweigh the risks when conservative 
management is considered. Although the risk of missing 
glandular or invasive disease and the risk of progression 
is relatively low, active surveillance should be offered 
only to women who would likely benefit from it. The 
woman’s age, values and preference, wish for future 
pregnancies, likelihood of high compliance, as well as 
the clinical findings (such as the presence of a visible 
transformation zone) should be taken into account 
when conservative management is contemplated. The 
benefits of spontaneous regression and minimal impact 
on future reproduction should be balanced against the 
risk of non-adherence to follow-up, the risk of invasion, 
and the costs of repeated visits on an individual basis. 
The histological classification of CIN2 lesions is known 
to be affected by marked interobserver variability, 
and many CIN2 lesions are often misclassified (over-
diagnosed or under-diagnosed). To minimise the risk 
of misclassification (of more severe abnormalities), it is 
recommended to discuss these cases in multidisciplinary 
pathology meetings on a regular basis.
Concerns could be raised about the recurrence rate 
of CIN lesions that are managed by active surveillance. 
A retrospective study by Wilkinson and colleagues has 
presented a follow-up after spontaneous regression 
of initial CIN2 in women aged less than 25 years.69 
With a median follow-up of nearly four years after 
spontaneous regression, 17% developed a new 
high grade lesion (diagnosed as either CIN3, CIN2, 
cytological HSIL, or ASC-H) compared with 4% in 
the women whose CIN2 was primarily conventionally 
treated. However, the recurrence risk to a high 
grade abnormality after spontaneous regression of 
CIN2 was comparable to the 12% after conservative 
management of CIN1,69 indicating that spontaneously 
regressed CIN2 lesions behave like CIN1 lesions. The 
authors concluded that careful observation of CIN2 
is an appropriate management for young women but 
suggested that a longer follow-up in a prospective 
setting would be valuable to estimate the true 
recurrence risk, considering as well the risk for cervical 
cancer being increased even after treatment of CIN2.10
The finding of our meta-analysis raise questions on 
appropriateness of the updated 2014 World Health 
Organization classification. The decision to simplify 
the previous three tiered classification system to a 
two tiered grouping consistent with the cytological 
definitions of low grade squamous intraepithelial 
lesion (LSIL) and HSIL arose from the appreciation 
of the equivocal histopathological diagnosis of 
CIN2 that is affected by the marked interobserver 
variability, which is less so in CIN3 lesions.64-66 The 
progressive potential of CIN3 has been reported to be 
substantially higher overall at 12%8 and 17% at five 
years.70 Therefore, the management of HSIL histology 
as a single entity might prevent more personalised 
care for those who are young and have lesions that are 
likely to regress, with substantial adverse reproductive 
consequences.11-16
In a meta-analysis assessing the use of p16 protein 
immunostaining in cytological and histological 
samples, higher grade lesions stained more for p16.71 
p16 immunostaining has been suggested by the LAST 
group (Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology) as 
the test that could assist the pathological classification 
of these lesions into low grade or high grade.72 p16 
negative lesions, formerly classified as CIN2, could be 
downgraded to LSIL to simplify clinical management. 
A study exploring the value of p16, Ki67 protein 
immunostaining, and HPV capsid protein L1 in 
improving diagnostic accuracy in cervical biopsies, 
found p16 to be more sensitive and less specific in 
diagnosing CIN2 or worse than routine pathological 
assessment. Ki67 did not improve the accuracy further, 
and HPV L1 was of no value.73
To date, no tests and biomarkers permit the prediction 
of CIN2 lesions with a true progressive potential. The 
results of two studies exploring the role of p16 in 
differentiating between regressive and progressive CIN2 
were conflicting.31 56 The first reported no predictive 
value, whereas the second reported value only in those 
strongly positive for p16. New biomolecular markers 
have the potential to allow the detection of CIN2 lesions 
with a true procarcinogeneic potential. Among many, 
HPV methylation and the microbiological markers 
have been shown in cross sectional studies to correlate 
to disease severity, and data on serial longitudinal 
samples are still awaited.74-78
Conclusion
The results of our analysis show higher rates 
of regression and lower rates of progression of 
histologically confirmed CIN2 lesions than previously 
reported, particularly in women aged less than 30. 
Conservative management with active surveillance, 
instead of immediate local excision, is therefore justified 
in selected women, especially if further pregnancies 
are considered and compliance with surveillance is 
likely to be high (primum non nocere). With increasing 
maternal age and increasing awareness that local 
treatment for CIN is associated with increased preterm 
birth and mid-trimester loss,11-16 treating only those 
with disease that has a true progressive potential is of 
utmost importance. In cases of disease that persists 
beyond two years, treatment is likely to be warranted.
