Local delivery of therapeutics for the treatment of inflammatory arthritis (IA) is limited by
short intra-articular half-lives. Since IA severity often fluctuates over time, a local drug
delivery method that titrates drug release to arthritis activity would represent an attractive
paradigm in IA therapy. Here we report the development of a hydrogel platform that exhibits
disassembly and drug release controlled by the concentration of enzymes expressed during
arthritis flares. In vitro, hydrogel loaded with triamcinolone acetonide (TA) releases drug on-
demand upon exposure to enzymes or synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
In arthritic mice, hydrogel loaded with a fluorescent dye demonstrates flare-dependent dis-
assembly measured as loss of fluorescence. Moreover, a single dose of TA-loaded hydrogel
but not the equivalent dose of locally injected free TA reduces arthritis activity in the injected
paw. Together, our data suggest flare-responsive hydrogel as a promising next-generation
drug delivery approach for the treatment of IA.

nflammatory arthritis (IA) encompasses a spectrum of
inflammatory
arthropathies
affecting
individual
joints
(monoarthritis), a few joints (oligoarthritis), or many joints
(polyarthritis). In polyarthritides-like rheumatoid arthritis, sys-
temic therapy is generally indicated and appropriate. However,
in situations where only one or a few joints are involved, local
therapy with intra-articular injections may offer distinct advan-
tages over systemic therapy by increasing the drug bioavailability
locally and reducing the potential for drug-induced systemic
toxicity. Unfortunately, drugs injected into joints are often cleared
very rapidly (t1/2 ∼0.1–6 h)1,2, which severely limits the feasibility
of this approach. Multiple platforms have been developed to
increase the joint residence time of drugs after intra-articular
injection, including liposomes3,4, solid lipid nanoparticles5,
micelles6, polymeric microparticles/nanoparticles7–9, and hydro-
gels10,11. Such systems have been shown to increase intra-
articular drug half-lives by at least 10–30-fold in preclinical
models2. However, none of the formulations have advanced past
clinical trials for IA.
IA often exhibits variable disease activity over time with
exacerbations (flares) and periods of low disease activity. Pre-
viously described intra-articular drug delivery systems provide
sustained drug release irrespective of disease activity. This likely
results in sub- or supra-therapeutic drug levels locally during
periods of high or low disease activity, respectively. A flare-
responsive drug delivery system would titrate drug release to
match the disease activity, resulting in optimal therapeutic effi-
cacy. It would also minimize unnecessary drug release during
periods of low disease activity, thereby prolonging the joint
residence time of the injected drug depot and hence the duration
of the therapeutic effect.
We have developed an arthritis flare-responsive hydrogel
platform by self-assembling a small-molecule amphiphile, trigly-
cerol monostearate (TG-18). This compound was identified in a
screen of the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) list of
generally recognized as safe (GRAS) compounds looking for
hydrogelators that can encapsulate a wide range of therapeutic
agents and have an enzyme-labile ester linkage to facilitate
hydrogel disassembly and drug release in response to enzymatic
activities present in inflammatory milieus12. As a GRAS agent,
TG-18 is relatively inexpensive and commercially available in
large quantities at high purity (Good Manufacturing Practice
Grade or Food Grade). In this study, we loaded TG-18 hydrogel
with the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide (TA) as a model
drug and demonstrated drug release in response to arthritis-
related enzyme activities in vitro. Using the K/BxN mouse model
of IA13,14 we showed that TG-18 hydrogel disassembly and hence
the release of an encapsulated dye correlate with the severity of
the arthritis flare in vivo. A single dose of TA-loaded hydrogel but
not the equivalent dose of locally injected free TA reduced
arthritis activity in the injected paw. Our study provides proof of
concept for TG-18 hydrogel as a potential next-generation drug
delivery platform for the treatment of IA. We demonstrate that
flare-responsive intra-articular drug release, i.e. the matching of
drug release to current disease activity, is feasible and deserves
further exploration.
Results
TG-18 self-assembly to hydrogel and encapsulation of TA. TG-
18 comprises a polyhydroxyl hydrophilic head group and a
polymethylene hydrophobic tail (Fig. 1a), and has a Krafft point
of approximately 55–60 °C in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/water
mixture. Therefore, TG-18 heated in DMSO/water to 55–60 °C
dissolves due to micelle formation, resulting in a clear solution.
Upon cooling, the solution forms a solid hydrogel comprising
self-assembled fibrous structures with interdigitated bilayers and
extended micelles15 (Fig. 1a). During self-assembly, hydrophobic

 drugs can be encapsulated into the hydrophobic core of the
lamellar fibers of the hydrogel (Fig. 1a). The drug-loaded bulk
hydrogel is injectable and can be administered as an intra-
articular injection. Within joints, enzymes overexpressed during
arthritis flare can disassemble the hydrogel, resulting in flare-
responsive drug release (Fig. 1c).
We encapsulated TA into TG-18 hydrogel (10% w/v) and were
able to achieve loading efficiency as high as 40% (w/w). Higher
order fibrous assemblies of TA-loaded hydrogel were observed
with high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM)
(Fig. 1b). To determine the stability of TA encapsulation into TG-
18 hydrogel, we evaluated the in vitro release of TA in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) at 37 °C comparing hydrogel
formulations generated with the same amount of TG-18 (10% w/
v), but loaded with different concentrations of TA. We observed a
dose–response relationship between the TA concentration and its
encapsulation stability in the hydrogel (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Hydrogels loaded with 10, 20, or 30 mg/ml TA showed excellent
long-term stability in PBS with less that 35% cumulative release of
TA over a period of 30 days. Hydrogel containing 40 mg/ml TA
showed 45% cumulative release over 30 days. We did not observe
substantial burst release within the first few hours for any of the
formulations. HR-SEM imaging revealed patches of non-fibrous
precipitates in hydrogels loaded with 30 mg/ml and even more so
with 40 mg/ml TA (Supplementary Fig. 2), suggesting that that
TA at high concentrations interferes with TG-18 self-assembly.
Based on these data we chose to use hydrogels prepared with 20
mg/ml TA for all subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies.
TA release in response to flare-associated enzymes. Acute flares
of IA are associated with upregulated expression of matrix
metalloproteinases
(MMPs)
and
other
tissue-degrading
enzymes12,16. Therefore, we investigated the ability of TG-18
hydrogel to disassemble and release the encapsulated TA in
response to defined enzymatic activities in vitro. Drug-loaded
hydrogels were incubated in PBS (pH 7.4) at 37 °C without or
with matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) (1.5 µg/ml), matrix
metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) (5 µg/ml), or MMP-9 (1 µg/ml).
Enzyme concentrations were chosen based on the values reported
for synovial fluid from RA patients12. As control, we incubated

 TA-loaded TG-18 hydrogel with an esterase, T. lanuginosus lipase
(200 U/ml). To mimic periodic IA flares, fresh enzyme was added
to the release medium (PBS) at multiple time points. In the
absence of enzyme, TA-loaded TG-18 hydrogel demonstrated
excellent stability to non-specific hydrolysis in PBS, with less than
25% cumulative release of TA over a period of 50 days and no
substantial burst release (Fig. 2a). Repeated addition of esterase or
MMPs increased the cumulative drug release (Fig. 2a–d), which
was suppressed when an MMP inhibitor cocktail was added
together with the MMPs (Fig. 2b–d). Repeated pulses of enzyme
resulted in significantly higher cumulative drug release compared
with a single pulse (Supplementary Fig. 3) and the amount of
cumulatively released TA correlated with the dose of the enzyme
added into the release medium (Supplementary Fig. 4).
TA release in response to synovial fluid from RA joints. We
then investigated the release of TA from TG-18 hydrogel under
conditions that more closely resemble the inflammatory milieu
during IA flare. Drug-loaded hydrogel was incubated in PBS
without or with the addition of synovial fluid from human RA
joints or synovial fluid from healthy human joints. Similar to the
studies with defined enzyme activities, synovial fluid was added at
multiple time points during the experiment. Strikingly, synovial
fluid from human RA joints but not from healthy human joints
significantly increased the cumulative TA release compared to PBS
(Fig. 2e). Addition of the MMP inhibitor cocktail suppressed TA
release triggered by RA synovial fluid (Fig. 2e), confirming that the
increase in drug release observed in the presence of arthritic
synovial fluid was due to enzyme-mediated hydrogel disassembly.

 In vitro biocompatibility of TA-loaded hydrogel. Next, we
investigated the in vitro biocompatibility of TG-18 hydrogel with
primary human chondrocytes and synoviocytes isolated from
healthy donors and RA patients. Cells were incubated in a 96-well
transwell plate in medium, PBS, or in medium with blank
hydrogel, TA-loaded TG-18 hydrogel, DMSO (equivalent to
hydrogel), or free TA (equivalent to TA-loaded TG-18 hydrogel)
added to the upper chamber. Metabolic activity was determined
by 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-
carboxanilide (XTT) assay after 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation.
Cells incubated in PBS showed a significant reduction in meta-
bolic activity compared to cells incubated in medium. In contrast,
chondrocytes and synoviocytes incubated in the presence of blank
or TA-loaded TG-18 hydrogel demonstrated greater than 65–70%
metabolic activity at all time points (Fig. 3a–d), which is con-
sistent with biocompatibility of these hydrogel formulations
according to published reports for assessing in vitro toxicity of
biomaterials17. Live/dead staining with calcein-AM/ethidium
homodimer-1 also did not show significant loss of cell viability or
changes in cell morphology in chondrocytes or synoviocytes
incubated with blank or TA-loaded hydrogel (Fig. 3e). On the
other hand, control cells treated with 70% methanol solution for
30 min showed significant cell death (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Anti-inflammatory response of TA-loaded hydrogel in vitro.
We also confirmed that the encapsulation of TA in TG-18
hydrogel does not compromise the activity of TA. Human
macrophages, differentiated from THP-1 monocytes, were sti-
mulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a transwell plate in the
presence of blank hydrogel, TA-loaded TG-18 hydrogel, DMSO
(equivalent to hydrogel), or free TA (equivalent to TA-loaded
TG-18 hydrogel) added to the upper chamber. After 24 h of
incubation, supernatant was assayed for tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-α and interleukin-10 (IL-10) by ELISA. Free TA and TA-
loaded TG-18 hydrogel resulted in similar reductions in TNF-α
secretion,
while
increasing
IL-10
secretion
(Supplementary
Fig. 6), demonstrating that the anti-inflammatory effect of TA in
the hydrogel formulation is not compromised.
TG-18 hydrogel disassembly in vivo. Having shown that TG-18
hydrogel disassembles and releases the encapsulated agent on-
demand in vitro, we investigated hydrogel disassembly in vivo
using the murine K/BxN serum-transfer model of IA13,14. In this
model, serum from arthritic K/BxN mice is injected intraper-
itoneally (i.p.) into naive C57BL/6J mice on days 0 and 2 resulting
in a highly predictable monophasic arthritis flare in the forepaws
and feet. Moreover, arthritis severity can be titrated by adjusting
the injected volume of K/BxN serum.
To monitor hydrogel disassembly, TG-18 hydrogel was loaded
with the fluorescent dye 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylin-
dotricarbocyanine iodide (DiR). DiR-loaded TG-18 hydrogel was
stable in PBS at 37 °C in vitro, whereas exposure to T. lanuginosus
lipase (2 or 200 U/ml) resulted in dose-dependent loss of
fluorescence (Fig. 4a–c). Arthritis-induced hydrogel disassembly

 could thus be quantified by in vivo imaging as loss of fluorescence
over time.
To investigate flare-responsive hydrogel disassembly in vivo,
we injected mice with 4 μl of DiR-loaded hydrogel into the right
hindpaw on day −1. Arthritis was subsequently induced by i.p.
injections on day 0 and day 2 of either 37.5 or 75 μl K/BxN serum.
Control animals received no serum. We imaged the animals every
other day using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS). Arthritis
severity was scored clinically based on a previously described
scoring system18,19 and paw swelling was measured with calipers
(Fig. 4d). As expected, mice who received 2 × 75 μl of K/BxN
serum had more severe arthritis than mice receiving 2 × 37.5 µl,
documented by the change in right hindpaw thickness (Fig. 4e, f),
right hindpaw clinical scores, total change in paw thickness, and
total clinical scores (Supplementary Fig. 7). Fluorescence signal
was detectable over the right hindpaw in arthritic mice and in
healthy control animals for the entire 2 weeks of the study
(Fig. 4g, h). Importantly, the fluorescence signal decayed more
rapidly in the arthritic animals. Moreover, animals injected with
2 × 75 µl serum showed a significantly more rapid decay of
fluorescence than animals injected with 2 × 37.5 µl serum who
had less severe arthritis (Fig. 4g–i). These results demonstrate that
TG-18 hydrogel is responsive to arthritis flare activity in vivo
resulting in on-demand disassembly and release of the encapsu-
lated agent controlled by the intensity of the inflammatory
stimulus.
Efficacy of TA-loaded hydrogel in vivo. We then investigated the
therapeutic efficacy of TA-loaded TG-18 hydrogel. To this end,
arthritis was induced by i.p. injections of K/BxN serum (37.5 ul)
on day 0 and day 2. Immediately after the second dose of K/BxN
serum, TA-loaded TG-18 hydrogel, free TA (equivalent to TA-
loaded TG-18 hydrogel), or blank TG-18 hydrogel was injected
into the right hindpaw (Fig. 5a). Treatment with TA-loaded TG-
18 hydrogel reduced arthritis severity in the injected right hind-
paw compared to animals treated with blank hydrogel (vehicle
control) (Fig. 5b–e). Free TA did not have a significant ther-
apeutic effect in this experiment, likely due to rapid clearance
from the injection site as reported previously20,21. We also
observed a reduction of change in total paw thickness and total
clinical score in animals treated with TA-loaded hydrogel com-
pared with the other groups (Fig. 5f–i). This was largely, although
not entirely, explained by the almost complete abrogation of
inflammation in the right hindpaw injected with TA-loaded
hydrogel.
Efficacy of TA-loaded hydrogel in vivo in severe arthritis.
Locally administered TA-loaded TG-18 hydrogel was also effec-
tive when the volume of arthritis-inducing K/BxN serum was
doubled to 75 µl in order to induce more severe disease (Fig. 6).
In this experiment, mice received two consecutive injections of
either blank or TA-loaded TG-18 hydrogel into the right hindpaw
on day 2 and day 6 (Fig. 6a). Treatment with a single dose of TA-
loaded TG-18 hydrogel on day 2 (TA gel→Blank gel) reduced
arthritis severity in the right hindpaw compared to animals
treated with blank hydrogel on days 2 and 6 (Blank gel→Blank
gel) (Fig. 6b–e). The effect of a single dose of TA-loaded TG-18
hydrogel injected on day 2 (TA gel→Blank gel) on clinical score
and paw swelling was statistically not different from two doses of
TA-loaded TG-18 hydrogel, injected on days 2 and 6 (TA gel→TA
gel) (Fig. 6b–e), although suppression of disease appeared more
complete in mice receiving two injections of drug-loaded
hydrogel. Injecting a single dose of TA-loaded hydrogel at the
peak of disease severity, i.e. day 6 (Blank gel→TA gel) was also
efficacious at reducing arthritis severity post injection (Fig. 6f–i).
We also observed a reduction of change in total paw thickness
and total clinical score in animals treated with TA-loaded TG-18
hydrogel (Supplementary Fig. 8). This was largely, although not
entirely,
explained by the almost complete abrogation of
inflammation in the right hindpaw injected with TA-loaded
hydrogel. Taken together, our data document the promise of TG-
18 hydrogel as a drug delivery system in IA to improve the
therapeutic efficacy of locally delivered drugs via arthritis flare-
responsive drug release.
Discussion
Several intra-articular drug delivery approaches have been
explored to increase the joint residence time of locally adminis-
tered therapeutics3–11. So far, these strategies have shown only
modest benefits over current clinical formulations when tested in
clinical trials2. For instance, a recent phase 2 study evaluated TA
encapsulated into biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid
microparticles (FX006, Flexion Therapeutics) in knee osteoar-
thritis22,23. Compared to standard treatment with intra-articular
bolus injection of TA (Kenalog-40), a single injection of the
FX006 formulation resulted in statistically significant but clini-
cally minimal improvement in pain relief with similar duration of
the therapeutic effect (~12 weeks)22–24.
Most of the previously described systems provide sustained
drug release over time. We reasoned that an autonomous drug
delivery system, which titrates drug release to the current disease
activity in the joint, might improve therapeutic outcomes. The
concept guiding the development of TG-18 hydrogel has been to
generate an intra-articular drug reservoir which releases drug in
response to enzymes overexpressed in inflamed joints. Prior
studies of inflammation-responsive drug delivery systems in IA
relied on polymeric particles releasing drug cargo in response to
the low pH in inflamed synovial fluid25–27. These drug-loaded
particles were administered systemically and entered inflamed
joints from the blood stream. However, the therapeutic benefits
from each injection lasted only 48–72 h in preclinical models26.
Moreover, intravenously injected nano- and microparticles tend
to accumulate in the liver and spleen via the reticuloendothelial
system26, increasing the risk for toxic side effects. Finally, the
synthesis of pH-responsive polymer conjugates like hyaluronic
acid-5β-cholanic acid conjugate based nanoparticles27 and N-(2-
hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymer-dexamethasone con-
jugate28,29 is complex, which limits scalability and translatability.
TG-18 on the other hand, can be coaxed to form self-assembling
hydrogel using a simple process. There is no chemical mod-
ification required for this platform, which makes our approach
amenable to large-scale manufacturing and can enable rapid
translation.
The enzyme-cleavable linker in TG-18 is an ester bond.
However, enzymes other than bona fide esterases can cleave ester
bonds. This includes MMPs, which are overexpressed during IA
flares12,30–32. The mechanism involves binding of the Zn (II) ion
of MMPs to external water molecules, followed by their depro-
tonation. This results in the formation of Zn(II)-bound hydro-
xides,
which
act
as
nucleophiles
that

electrophilic
substrates including carboxy esters like those found in TG-
1833,34. Previous attempts to develop MMP-responsive drug
delivery systems involved the synthesis of specific MMP-cleavable
peptides such as GGRMSMPV35,36, which were then incorpo-
rated into the drug delivery system by chemical conjugation. In
contrast, our approach is peptide-free and utilizes off-the shelf
materials which do not require chemical modification and is
amenable to large-scale manufacturing. Despite the simplicity of
the formulation, we did not observe substantial burst release of
TA from TG-18 in vitro. In fact, spontaneous cumulative drug

 release was only 20% over 10 days in vitro. In contrast, amphi-
phillic polyphosphazene-based polymeric micelles loaded with
indomethacin showed 95% cumulative drug release within 5 h6.
Burst release of drug is undesirable as it results in rapid
exhaustion of the drug depot and systemic absorption of the
released therapeutic can lead to systemic toxicity.
A single pulse of RA synovial fluid triggered the enzymatic
release of TA from TG-18 hydrogel, but did not result in 100%
cumulative release. The bulk of TG-18 hydrogel comprises mul-
tiple self-assembled interdigitated bilayers, arranged as concentric
layers in each fiber. Presumably, only TG-18 available on the fiber
surface is accessible to enzyme-mediated cleavage of the ester
bond, ensuring that the hydrogel is not completely unstable in the
inflamed joints.
TG-18 hydrogel is a versatile platform that can encapsulate a
wide range of therapeutics and is not limited to a single drug. We
have previously shown the utility of TG-18 for local delivery of
tacrolimus in a preclinical model of vascularized composite allo-
transplantation15. We have also identified multiple other GRAS
amphiphiles, including ascorbyl palmitate37, that can self-
assemble to form inflammation-responsive hydrogels. These
ampiphiles can be leveraged in the future to develop formulations
with maximum loading and stability of the therapeutics of
interest, enabling future expansion of the platform.
Our study has certain limitations. First, while our goal has been
to develop a system that releases the drug on-demand exclusively
in response to inflammation with minimal release under non-
inflammatory conditions, we did observe baseline drug and dye

Fig. 6 Local delivery of TA-loaded TG-18 hydrogel demonstrates therapeutic efficacy in severe arthritis. a Experimental outline: Arthritis was induced by i.p.
injection of 75 µl K/BxN serum on day 0 and day 2. Immediately after the second dose of K/BxN serum, animals were randomized into four groups. The
right hindpaw of each mouse was injected with hydogel on day 2 and day 6. The (Blank gel→Blank gel) group received blank hydrogel (4 µl) twice, (TA
gel→Blank gel) mice received TA-loaded TG-18 hydrogel (20 mg TA/ml, 4 µl) on day 2 and blank hydrogel on day 6, the (TA gel→TA gel) group received
two doses of TA-loaded TG-18 hydrogel, and the (Blank gel→TA gel) group received blank hydrogel on day 2 and TA-loaded TG-18 hydrogel on day 6.

 release under non-inflammatory conditions in vitro and in vivo.
This may be due to non-enzymatic hydrolysis of TG-18 in aqu-
eous environments, resulting in gel disassembly or due to passive
diffusion of non-encapsulated or surface-absorbed drug or dye.
Formulations of next-generation flare-responsive hydrogels could
incorporate modifications that reduce or eliminate spontaneous
gel disassembly and drug release. For example, the hydrogel
composition maybe tweaked to reduce baseline non-enzymatic
hydrolysis, for instance by combining TG-18 with other amphi-
philes that are not responsive to inflammatory enzymes. Alter-
natively, the hydrogel preparation and drug encapsulation process
maybe modified to minimize the amount of surface-absorbed
drug or remove it prior to injection.
Secondly, one would like to administer drug-loaded hydrogel
directly into joints in preclinical models to mimic the proposed
use in humans and determine true joint residence times. How-
ever, mouse joints are very small which imposes strict limits on
the total injectable volume and, for all practical purposes, limits
intra-articular injections to the knee joints. In K/BxN serum-
transfer arthritis, which we choose for this study because of its
excellent reproducibility and titratability, the knee joints are not
affected19,38. Using animal models with larger joints (i.e. rat,
rabbit, goat, pig) would permit the injection of volumes similar to
what one would administer in humans. More extensive in vivo
biocompatibility evaluation will also be required in large animal
models prior to clinical trials in humans. Future in vivo studies
comparing flare-responsive drug delivery with sustained release
will be important to establish the therapeutic advantage of
arthritis flare-responsiveness drug delivery approach. Validating
this platform in other mouse arthritis models will also be
important for its clinical translation. Finally, future studies will
explore the delivery of other established or investigational drugs,
followed by in vivo mechanistic studies involving detailed histo-
logical analysis and measurements of relevant cytokines and other
inflammatory mediators in the joint.
In conclusion, we have developed an arthritis flare-responsive
drug delivery platform for on-demand intra-articular release of
therapeutics. This system has the potential to provide the optimal
amount of a therapeutic at a time when it is needed, thereby
maximizing therapeutic efficacy and prolonging the duration of
the therapeutic benefit.
Methods
Preparation of hydrogel and drug encapsulation. To prepare blank hydrogel
(10% w/v), 100 mg of triglycerol monostearate (TG-18) (AK Scientific) was
weighed into a glass scintillation vial, followed by the addition of 1 ml
DMSO–water mixture (1:4 volume ratio). The mixture was heated to 60–80 °C
until TG-18 dissolved. The vial was then placed on a flat surface and allowed to
cool to room temperature for 15–30 min, resulting in hydrogel formation. Gelation
was complete when no gravitational flow was observed upon inversion of the vial.
TA (Sigma Aldrich) or 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine
iodide (DiR) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added to the vial together with TG-
18, for a final concentration of 10–40 mg/ml TA and 100 µg/ml DiR. For in vivo
studies, we transferred the heated hydrogel preparations to glass syringes prior to
gelation. Hydrogel morphology was characterized by HR-SEM (Zeiss Merlin High-
resolution SEM, acceleration voltage, 2 kV). For electron microscopic analysis,
xerogels were prepared by lyophilizing the gels. Small amounts of xerogels were
placed on carbon tape attached to aluminum grids and coated with a thin layer of
gold using a sputtering machine.
Cell culture. Primary human synoviocytes and chondrocytes from healthy and RA
donors (Articular Engineering) were cultured in T-75 flasks (VWR) at 37 °C and
5% CO2 in synoviocyte growth medium or chondrocyte growth medium (Articular
Engineering), respectively. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
(Articular Engineering) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher
Scientific).
Human THP-1 monocytes (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured
in T-75 flasks at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 (American Type Culture
Collection) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 0.05
M β-mercaptoethanol (EMD Millipore), and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. For
differentiation into macrophages, 1×106 cells were treated with 50 nM phorbol 12-
myristate 13-acetate (Sigma Aldrich) for 3 days. Cell lines were authenticated by
their sources using morphology, karyotyping, and PCR based approaches.
Enzyme-responsive release. Enzyme-responsive release of TA from TG-18
hydrogel was performed at pH 7.4 and 37 °C. TA-loaded hydrogels (50 μl, 20 mg
TA/ml) were placed in dialysis tubing (8–10 kDa molecular weight cut-off; Spec-
trum Labs) and suspended in PBS (950 μl) without or with one of the following
enzymes: esterase (T. lanuginosus lipase, 200, 400, or 800 U/ml) (Sigma Aldrich);
recombinant human MMP-2 (1.5 μg/ml) (Sigma Aldrich); recombinant human
MMP-3 (5 µg/ml) (Sigma Aldrich), and recombinant human MMP-9 (1 μg/ml)
(Sigma Aldrich). In some experiments, MMP-2/9 Inhibitor II (Sigma Aldrich) or
MMP-3 Inhibitor II (Sigma Aldrich) was added along with the MMPs. Fresh
enzyme or enzyme + MMP inhibitor were added at multiple time points as indi-
cated in the figure legends. The dialysis bags filled with hydrogel in release medium
were placed in 45 ml sink medium (PBS), and incubated at 37 °C with a shaking
speed of 150 rpm. At each time point, an aliquot (1 ml) of sink medium was
removed and replenished with the same volume of fresh PBS to ensure constant
sink conditions. Aliquots were lyophilized and dissolved in 250 μl methanol, fol-
lowed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Agilent 1100 qua-
ternary LC pump liquid chromatograph, Zorbax SB C-18 column, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5
µm).
In vitro release in response to human synovial fluid. TA-loaded TG-18
hydrogels (50 μl, 20 mg TA/ml) were placed in dialysis tubing (8–10 kDa molecular
weight cut-off) and suspended in PBS (650 μl). The dialysis bags were placed in 45
ml sink medium (PBS), and incubated at 37 °C with a shaking speed of 150 rpm. To
evaluate drug release in response to synovial fluid from healthy and human RA
joints, 200 µl synovial fluid from human RA joints or healthy human joints
(Articular Engineering) or an equal volume of PBS was added to the dialysis bag at
multiple time points. In some experiments, MMP-2/9 Inhibitor II was added
together with synovial fluid from human RA joints. Aliquots taken from the sink
medium (PBS) were analyzed using HPLC, as described above.
In vitro biocompatibility. Cultured primary human synoviocytes and chon-
drocytes were harvested at 80% confluency and seeded (seeding density: 20,000
cells/well) in 96-well plates (Corning) containing transwell inserts (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). After 24 h of culture, medium was replaced with fresh medium, PBS, or
fresh medium with 50 µl blank hydrogel, 50 µl TA-loaded hydrogel, DMSO
(equivalent to 50 µl gel), or free TA (equivalent to 50 µl TA-loaded hydrogel) added
to the upper chamber. After 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation, cellular metabolic
activity was determined using 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tet-
razolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) cell proliferation assay kit (American Type Cul-
ture Collection) and was normalized relative to cells treated with only medium to
determine percentage metabolic activity.
Alternatively, primary human synoviocytes and chondrocytes were seeded on
coverslips placed in 24-well plates (Corning) containing transwell inserts (Fisher
Scientific) at 50,000–100,000 cells/well. After 24 h of culture, medium was replaced
with fresh medium or fresh medium with 75 µl blank hydrogel or 75 µl TA-loaded
hydrogel added to the upper chamber. After 72 h of incubation, live-dead staining
was performed using calcein-AM/ethidium homodimer-1 dye solutions from the
LIVE/DEAD™ Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cells treated with 30% methanol for 30 min were used as positive control for cell
death. Cells were imaged using EVOS FL Cell Imaging System (Thermo Fisher
Scientific).
In vitro anti-inflammatory activity. Human macrophages, differentiated from
THP-1 cells in 24-well transwell plates, were incubated in medium or in medium
with 100 µl blank hydrogel, 100 µl TA-loaded hydrogel, DMSO (equivalent to 100
µl hydrogel), or free TA (equivalent to 100 µl of TA-loaded hydrogel) added to the
upper chamber of the transwell. LPS (100 ng/ml) was added in all wells to activate
the macrophages. After 24 h of incubation, supernatants were assayed for TNF and
IL-10 using commercial ELISA kits (BioLegend).
Disassembly of DiR-loaded hydrogel in vitro. Aliquots of DiR-loaded hydrogel
(100 µl) were added to the upper chambers of a PBS-filled 12-well transwell plate
on day −2. The plate was then incubated in a 37 °C incubator shaker. On day 0, the
PBS in each well was replaced with fresh PBS without or with T. lanuginosus lipase
(2 or 200 U/ml). The plate was again incubated in a 37 °C incubator shaker and
fluorescence signals were quantified on days 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5. To this end, the
transwell inserts with the DiR-loaded hydrogels were temporarily removed, placed
on a new plate, and imaged using an IVIS (IVIS Lumina II; PerkinElmer) at the
Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology–Longwood Screening Facility at Harvard
Medical School.
Mice. All in vivo experiments were performed in 6–10-week-old male C57BL/6J
mice (Jackson Laboratory). The group sizes for each experimental design (at least
six animals per treatment group) was determined based on the minimal number of

 animals needed to achieve a significant difference of P < 0.05 between experimental
groups for the primary outcome of individual experiment using statistical analysis
indicated in each figure legend. We randomly selected mice from the cage to assign
them to different experimental groups. Experiments were performed in specific
pathogen-free animal facilities at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health
or Brigham and Women’s Hospital, or at the Institute of Chemistry and Cell
Biology–Longwood Screening Facility at Harvard Medical School. Mice were
housed under standard 12 h light–12 h dark conditions with ad libitum access to
water and chow. All mouse studies were performed according to the institutional
and National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for humane animal use and in
accordance with the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care. Protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) at Harvard Medical School.
K/BxN serum-transfer model of IA. To induce IA, K/BxN serum (37.5 or 75 µl)
was injected i.p. on experimental days 0 and 2. Every other day for 14 days, paw
and ankle swelling were measured using calipers along with clinical indices as
described18,19,39. Briefly, arthritis severity in each forepaw or ankle was rated from
0 (normal) to 3 (severe). Results are reported for the right hindpaw alone (RHP Δ
thickness or RHP clinical score) or as the sum of all four paws (total Δ thickness or
total clinical score).
Hydrogel disassembly in vivo. Mice were injected with either DiR-loaded
hydrogel (4 µl, 100 µg DiR/ml) or hydrogel co-loaded with DiR and TA (4 µl, 20 mg
TA/ml) under the skin of the dorsal aspect of the right hindpaw on day −1.
Arthritis was subsequently induced with two i.p. injections of 37.5 or 75 μl K/BxN
serum on day 0 and day 2. Control animals received no serum. Every other day for
14 days, mice were anesthetized via isoflurane inhalation, and imaged using IVIS.
In vivo therapeutic efficacy. Mice were injected with K/BxN serum (37.5 μl) i.p.
on days 0 and 2. Immediately after the second dose of K/BxN serum, animals were
randomized into three groups and injected with TA-loaded TG-18 hydrogel (4 µl,
20 mg TA/ml), free TA (4 µl, 20 mg TA/ml), or blank TG-18 hydrogel (4 µl) into
the right hindpaw. Arthritis severity was measured every other day for
14 days18,19,39.
Alternatively, mice were injected with K/BxN serum (75 μl) i.p. on days 0 and 2.
Immediately after the second dose of K/BxN serum, animals were randomized into
four groups: Immediately after the second dose of K/BxN serum, animals were
randomized into four groups: (Blank gel→Blank gel) group received blank hydrogel
(4 µl) on days 0 and 2, (TA gel→Blank gel) group received TA-loaded hydrogel (4
µl, 20 mg TA/ml) on day 2 and blank hydrogel on day 6, (TA gel → TA gel) group
received two doses of TA-loaded TG-18 hydrogel—one on day 2 and another on
day 6, and (Blank gel → TA gel) group received blank hydrogel on day 2 and TA-
loaded TG-18 hydrogel on day 6. Arthritis severity was measured every other day
for 14 days18,19,39. The investigator performing the assessment of arthritis activity
was unaware of group assignment of the individual mouse. Mice from different
groups were co-housed.
Statistics. Statistical analysis and graphing were done with Graphpad Prism. The
two-tailed Student’s t-test with Welch’s correction (to stabilize the variance
between different groups) was used to compare two experimental groups and one-
way Anova with Tukey’s post hoc analysis was used for comparing more than two
groups. To test for statistical significance of changes in paw thickness and clinical
score, the area under curve for individual mice was calculated and group means
were compared. The same approach was used to determine the statistical sig-
nificance of differences in fluorescence signal decay in the in vitro or in vivo
experiments with DiR-loaded hydrogel. For in vivo efficacy experiment performed
in severe arthritis conditions, Grubb’s analysis (with alpha = 0.5) was performed to
detect outliers, which resulted in the exclusion of one animal from the analysis. A
value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
