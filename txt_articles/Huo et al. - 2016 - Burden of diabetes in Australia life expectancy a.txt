Abstract
Aims/hypothesis The aim of this work was to estimate the life
expectancy (LE) and disability-free life expectancy (DFLE)
for adults with and without diabetes.
Methods The Chiang method and the adapted Sullivan
method were used to estimate LE and DFLE by age and sex.
Mortality data in 2011 were available from the National
Diabetes Services Scheme for diabetes and from standard na-
tional mortality datasets for the general population. Data on
prevalence of disability and severe or profound core activity
limitation were derived from the 2012 Australian Survey of
Disability, Ageing and Carers (SDAC). The definitions of
disability used in the SDAC followed the International
Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Data on
diabetes prevalence were derived from the Australian
Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle study.
Results The estimated LE and DFLE (with 95% uncertainty
interval [UI]) at age 50 years were 30.2 (30.0, 30.4) and 12.7
(11.5, 13.7) years, respectively, for men with diabetes, and the
estimates were 33.9 (33.6, 34.1) and 13.1 (12.3, 13.9) years,
respectively, for women with diabetes. The estimated loss of
LE associated with diabetes at age 50 years was 3.2 (3.0, 3.4)
years for men and 3.1 (2.9, 3.4) years for women, as compared
with their counterparts without diabetes. The corresponding
estimated loss of DFLE was 8.2 (6.7, 9.7) years for men and
9.1 (7.9, 10.4) years for women. Women with diabetes spent a
greater number of absolute years and a greater proportion of
their life with disability as compared with men with diabetes
and women without diabetes. The gains in LE and DFLE
across the whole population at age 50 years after hypotheti-
cally eliminating diagnosed diabetes were 0.6 (0.5, 0.6) years
and 1.8 (1.0, 2.8) years.
Conclusions/interpretation In adults, diabetes results in a
modest reduction in LE and a substantial reduction in
DFLE. Efforts to identify the specific causes of disability
and effective interventions are needed.

Introduction
Diabetes is a major health problem worldwide, affecting 415
million people globally in 2015 [1]. In Australia, the preva-
lence of diabetes has more than doubled over the past three
decades [2], with an estimate of around one million people
living with diabetes in 2011–2012 and a large proportion of
this burden being experienced by older people [3, 4]. It is
predicted that more than one-third of today’s young adults will
develop diabetes during their lifetime and that 14% of their
remaining life will be spent living with diabetes [5].
Meanwhile, owing to advances in treatment and better avail-
ability of diabetes care, mortality has declined [6, 7] and life
expectancy (LE) [8] has increased for people with diabetes. A
study from the USA reported that reduction in LE due to
diabetes when diagnosed at age 40 years decreased from
7.7 years in 1990–1999 to 5.8 years in 2000–2011 in men
and from 8.7 years to 6.8 years in women [8]. The rising
prevalence, together with the improvement in longevity, has
prompted a greater emphasis to be placed on the health-related
quality of life in people with diabetes.
Diabetes and its associated complications and
comorbidities have been suggested to lead to poor health
and to physical disability among older adults [9–11], and im-
pose a substantial burden on healthcare expenditure [12, 13].
In a recent comprehensive meta-analysis of 26 studies [14],
Wong et al found that there was a 50–80% increase in the odds
of disability in diabetes compared with no diabetes.
There are two major classes of summary measures of pop-
ulation health: positive measures of health expectancy, such as
health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) and disability-free
life expectancy (DFLE), and measures of health gaps such
as disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). DALYs are more
commonly used to compare the burden of different diseases,
often across different countries. DFLE, which is a focus of this
study, incorporates both disability prevalence and mortality
levels and has been widely employed to measure burdens of
diseases. However, very few studies have provided estimates
of the impact of diabetes on DFLE. In this study, we aimed to
examine the contemporary burden of diabetes using data from
the 2012 Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers (SDAC) and
national mortality data. We estimated LE and DFLE for indi-
viduals with and without diabetes and the gain in LE and
DFLE after hypothetical elimination of diagnosed diabetes
using a disease-delete method [15].
Methods
LE at an exact age is the average remaining years that will be
lived by a group of individuals after that age, assuming age-
specific mortality rates remain stable over time. LE is com-
posed of lengths of time spent in different states of health until
death, while DFLE is the number of remaining years, at a
particular age, which an individual can expect to live in a
disability-free state. DFLE is a composite indicator that com-
bines morbidity and mortality into a single statistic. To calcu-
late DFLE, age-specific mortality data taken from period life
tables and data on the prevalence of disability are required.
Data sources Diabetes prevalence was derived from the
Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study,
the methods of which have been described previously [16,
17]. In brief, the AusDiab study is the largest Australian lon-
gitudinal population-based study to examine the natural histo-
ry of diabetes and heart and kidney diseases and has provided
nationally representative data on the prevalence of diabetes in
Australia.
All-cause mortality rates of people with diabetes in 2011
were determined through a linkage of the National Diabetes
Services Scheme (NDSS) to the National Death Index (NDI).
The NDSS was established by the Australian government in
1987 to deliver diabetes-related products at subsidised prices
and to provide information to people with diabetes.
Registration of patients is free and is completed by a medical
practitioner or accredited diabetes educator. The NDSS cap-
tures 80–90% of all Australians with known diabetes [18].
The linkage method has been reported previously [7, 19].
National mortality rates for the general population in 2011
were provided by the Australian Institute of Health and
Welfare (AIHW). To calculate mortality rates for the popula-
tion without diabetes (MNDM), we used the following formula:
M = [MNDM × (1 − p)] + [MDM × p], where M is the age-
specific mortality rate for the total population, MDM is the
age-specific mortality rate for the population with diabetes
and p is the age-specific diabetes prevalence rate derived from
the AusDiab study.
The 2012 SDAC is the seventh comprehensive national sur-
vey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to
measure disability. Multi-stage sampling techniques were used
to select the sample for the survey. After sample loss, the house-
hold sample included 27,410 private dwellings with a response
rate of 89.8% and 518 non-private dwellings with a response
rate of 80.4%, while the cared-accommodation sample included
1,142 health establishments with a response rate of 87.5% [20].
The survey data are weighted by the ABS to address the issue of
unequal probability of selection in the survey and to make the
survey data a true representation of the Australian population.
The 2012 SDAC provided information on the prevalence of
disability by sex and 5 year age group in the general population.

Diabetologia (2016) 59:1437–1445
 The age-specific disability prevalence in people with and with-
out diabetes was derived by combining age-specific national
disability prevalence from the 2012 SDAC, age-specific diabe-
tes prevalence from the AusDiab study and RRs of disability
associated with diabetes from Wong et al’s meta-analysis [14].
The age-specific prevalence of disability in those with diabetes
(Dd) and those without diabetes (Dnd) was then calculated using
the following formulas: D=[Dnd×(1−p)]+[Dnd×RR×p]
and Dd=Dnd×RR, where D is the age-specific prevalence of
disability for the total population, RR is the RR of disability in
the population with diabetes relative to the population without
diabetes and p is the age-specific prevalence of diabetes.
Age was stratified into 5 year groups from age 50 up to age
79 years and an open-ended group thereafter. All data analyses
were performed by each age group and sex.
Disability In the 2012 SDAC, the definitions of disability
generally follow the conceptual framework of the
International Classification of Functioning, Disability and
Health (ICF). A person is defined as having a disability if they
have at least one of 17 limitations, restrictions or impairments,
which has lasted or is likely to last for at least 6 months and
restricts everyday activities. People who were identified as
having a disability were then asked about their need for assis-
tance with the core activities of self-care (bathing or
showering, dressing, eating, using the toilet and bladder or
bowel control), mobility (getting into or out of a bed or chair,
moving around at home and going to, or getting around, a
place away from home) and communication (understanding
and being understood by others: strangers, family and
friends). Four levels of core activity limitation were deter-
mined, based on whether a person needs help, has difficulty
or uses aids or equipment with any of the core activities. A
person’s overall level of core activity limitation was deter-
mined by the highest level of limitation in these core activities,
the levels being classed as mild, moderate, severe and pro-
found. For details of the survey’s operational definitions of
disability and severe or profound core activity limitation,
please see the ABS website [20].
Statistical methods Abridged period life tables from age
50 years, which combined the age-specific mortality rates
and age-specific disability prevalence, were constructed using
Chiang’s [21] and Sullivan’s [22] method by 5 year age
groups up to age 79 years and an open-ended group thereafter
for each sex, conditional on surviving to the diagnosis date for
the diabetes population. The life table output was LE, DFLE,
life expectancy with disability (LED) and the years lived with
severe or profound core activity limitation. Ninety-five per
cent uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the life table measures
were derived by analysing the impact of each of the key inputs
using @ Risk Software (Version 7.0.0; Palisade, Ithaca, NY,
USA). @ RISK is a software macro add-on for Microsoft
Excel that performs Monte Carlo simulation. With this meth-
od, inputs are entered as ranges rather than single values and
each range is described by a probability distribution (trigen) to
reflect the nature of uncertainty. In these analyses, the inputs
for the @ RISK simulation were the point estimate and its
95% CIs. The CIs of these inputs were calculated using a
1,000 replicate bootstrap procedure. All estimates in our
own work are given with 95% UI.
The gains in LE and DFLE for the whole population, after the
hypothetical elimination of diagnosed diabetes, were calculated
by the disease-deleted method [15]. According to this method the
gain in LE (or DFLE) is the difference in LE (or DFLE) between
the population without diabetes and the total population.
Sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate the ef-
fect of the RR of disability associated with diabetes on the
estimates of DFLE, LED and the years lived with severe or
profound core activity limitation. Wong et al’s meta-analysis
[14] reported that diabetes increased the risk of mobility dis-
ability (15 studies; OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.53, 1.91; RR 1.51, 95%
CI 1.38, 1.64), of instrumental activities of daily living dis-
ability (10 studies; OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.55, 1.74) and of activ-
ities of daily living disability (ADLs) (16 studies; OR 1.82,
95% CI 1.63, 2.04; RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.40, 2.36). For the
current study, the RR of disability associated with diabetes
was taken to be 1.65 (95% CI 1.55, 1.74), which was the
medium RR among the three RRs and also corresponded to
the moderate degree of disability among the three disability
definitions. Due to the lack of availability of age-specific es-
timates of the RR of diabetes-associated disability in the liter-
ature, we applied the same RR across all age groups. For the
sensitivity analysis, the RRs of 1.51 (1.38, 1.64) and 1.82
(1.40, 2.36) were used for calculating disability prevalence
in those with and without diabetes and then estimating the
DFLE, LED and the years lived with severe or profound core
activity limitation based on the abridged period life tables.
Data analysis was carried out using STATA version 12.1
(Statacorp, College Station, TX, USA), Microsoft Excel 2010
(Microsoft, USA) and @ RISK Version 7.0 (Palisade, Ithaca,
NY, USA). This study was approved by the Alfred Hospital
Health Human Ethics Committee and the AIHW Ethics
Committee.
Results
Both the prevalence of all disability and the prevalence of
severe or profound core activity limitation increased with
age irrespective of diabetes status and sex and both were sig-
nificantly higher in those with diabetes than in those without
diabetes (Table 1). The estimated prevalence of all disability
increased from 27.5% at age 50 years to 100% at age 80 years
and over, for men with diabetes and from 26.3% to 100% for
women with diabetes. The estimated prevalence of severe or

 profound core activity limitation increased from 5.7% at age
50 years to 48.8% at age 80 years and over, for men with
diabetes, and from 8.4% to 66.7% for women with diabetes.
Table 2 shows the estimates of LE, DFLE, LED and the
years lived with severe or profound core activity limitation.
These estimates were based on a single summary estimate for
RR of disability associated with diabetes of 1.65 (95% CI
1.55, 1.74) which was derived from Wong et al’s meta-
analysis [14]. The estimated LE and DFLE for people with
diabetes were lower than for those without diabetes from age
50 years to age 80 years and over. Men with diabetes at age
50 years had an estimated LE of 30.2 (95% UI 30.0, 30.4)
years with 12.7 (11.5, 13.7) years of DFLE and another 17.5
(16.4, 18.7) years of LED, including 5.8 (4.7, 6.9) years lived
with severe or profound core activity limitation. Compared
with men without diabetes, men with diabetes at age 50 years
had 3.2 (3.0, 3.4) years of estimated LE loss and 8.2 (6.7,
9.7) years of estimated DFLE loss. Women with diabetes at
age 50 years could expect to have an estimated LE of 33.9
(33.6, 34.1) years with 13.1 (12.3, 13.9) years of DFLE and
another 20.8 (20.0, 21.7) years of LED, including 9.2 (8.1,
10.4) years with severe or profound core activity limitation.
In women, those with diabetes as compared with those with-
out diabetes at age 50 years had 3.1 (2.9, 3.4) years of esti-
mated LE loss and 9.1 (7.9, 10.4) years of estimated DFLE
loss. The significant differences in estimates of LE and
DFLE between those with and without diabetes could be
observed across all age groups but gradually declined with
increasing age.
The proportion of the estimated years lived with disability or
severe or profound core activity limitation increased with age,
irrespective of diabetes status and sex, but was much higher in
people with diabetes than in those without diabetes and also
higher in women than in men (Fig. 1). At age 50 years, the
estimated years lived with disability accounted for 58.0% of total
LE for men with diabetes and 61.4% of total LE for women with
diabetes, compared with 37.5% and 40.0% of total LE, respec-
tively, for men and women without diabetes (Fig. 1a). The pro-
portion of the estimated years lived with severe or profound core
activity limitation at age 50 years was 19.1% and 27.2%, respec-
tively, for men and women with diabetes and 12.2% and 17.2%,
respectively, for men and women without diabetes (Fig. 1b).
Overall, women had longer LE and LED than men, and the
significant sex difference in estimated LE narrowed with age,
while the sex difference in estimated LED plateaued between
age 50 and 65 years, and then gradually reduced among the
older population (Fig. 2). The pattern was similar in those with
and without diabetes. However, the sex difference in estimated
LED and in the estimated years lived with severe or profound
core activity limitation for the population with diabetes was
proportionally larger than that for the population without dia-
betes across all ages. There was no significant sex difference
in estimated DFLE in those with or without diabetes.
The gain in LE at age 50 years for the whole population,
after eliminating diagnosed diabetes was estimated to be 0.6
(95% UI 0.5, 0.6) years. The corresponding gain in DFLE was
1.8 (1.0, 2.8) years, including 1.1 (0.3, 1.8) years without
severe or profound core activity limitation.

 In sensitivity analyses, we set the RR of disability associ-
ated with diabetes as 1.51 (95% CI 1.38, 1.64) and 1.82 (1.40,
2.36), which were derived from Wong et al’s meta-analysis
[14] to calculate the disability prevalence in the population
with and without diabetes and then constructed the life tables,
separately (electronic supplementary material [ESM] Tables 1
and 2). The point estimates of DFLE for diabetes were a little
higher (RR=1.51) or lower (RR=1.82) than the main study
results but with overlapped UIs. For example, at age 50 years,
the estimate of DFLE for men with diabetes was 16.9 (95% UI
15.5, 17.9) years when the RR was set as 1.51 and 14.5 (12.3,
16.4) years when the RR was set as 1.82 and was 15.9 (14.8,
16.9) years in the main study.
Discussion
In this study, we used a national survey of disability, a national
cohort study of diabetes and national mortality data to estimate
the disability burden of diabetes. The results showed that dia-
betes was associated with an estimated loss of LE and DFLE
of 3.2 years and 8.2 years, respectively, for men and 3.1 years
and 9.1 years, respectively, for women, living with diabetes at
age 50 years. Furthermore, women with diabetes spent more
years and a greater proportion of life (61.4% at age 50 years)
with disability than did women without diabetes and men with
diabetes.
LE and DFLE are two widely used measures with which to
evaluate the impact of a disease. DFLE adds a quality dimen-
sion to LE. As expected, LE and DFLE for the population
with diabetes were shorter than for the population without
diabetes. Australian data from 10 years ago showed that the
loss in LE was 5.6 years and 4.9 years for men and women
with diabetes, respectively, from age 55 years [5], higher than
the loss reported in the current study (corresponding estimates
in the current study were 2.6 years for both sexes). LE for the
population with diabetes has improved in the last two decades
and the LE loss associated with diabetes has reduced. National
population-based studies in the USA and Canada have dem-
onstrated that diabetes has a substantial impact on the length
and quality of life. In the USA, Narayan et al [23] reported LE
and quality-adjusted life-years according to the age of diagno-
sis for the US population with diabetes in 2000. For example,
among people diagnosed with diabetes at age 50 years, the

 loss in LE was 9.2 and 12.1 years for men and women,
respectively, and the loss of quality-adjusted life-years was
14.5 and 18.0 years for men and women, all of which were
much higher than the estimates in our study. One of the pos-
sible explanations for this difference could be that the study
population in the USA comprised less contemporary cohorts,
where follow-up occurred during time periods when mortality
risk for diabetes may have been greater. Additionally, Narayan
et al’s study [23] calculated quality-adjusted life-years by
weighting each year with diabetes by 0.75 of a year without
diabetes, which is a less precise approach than ours. In
Canada, using the Health Utilities Index to assess health-
related quality of life, Manuel and Schultz [24] estimated that
the LE of people with diabetes at age 55 years was, respec-
tively, 6.4 and 8.2 years less than the LE for men and women
without diabetes and that the HALE was 5.8 and 7.1 years less
than that of men and women without diabetes in 1996–1997;
Loukine et al [15] estimated 5.0 and 6.0 years of LE loss and
5.3 and 5.8 years of HALE loss associated with diabetes for
men and women at age 55 years in 2000–2006. However,
compared with the studies in Canada, our study reported a
lower loss of LE (2.6 years for both sexes at age 55 years)
but a larger loss of DFLE (7.5 years for women and 8.5 years
for men at age 55 years) for the population with diabetes.
Although results may not be directly comparable because
there are differences in the methods used for measuring dis-
ability, the recent cohort and inclusion of the residents living
in long-term care facilities in the 2012 SDAC might contribute
to the difference between our study and the Canadian studies.
To further quantify the impact of diabetes on population
health, we introduced the disease-deleted method and found
that eliminating diagnosed diabetes would result in a compres-
sion of morbidity, as there would be only a small gain in LE
(0.6 years at age 50 years) but a gain of nearly 2 years of
DFLE. This suggests that the impact of diabetes on the quality
of life is larger than the impact on length of life, which could
partly be explained by an ageing population and declining
mortality in diabetes [7].
A comparison between sexes revealed that women with
diabetes lived longer than men with diabetes but spent a great-
er number of years and a greater proportion of their life with
disability. The differential impact of diabetes by sex on LED
can be explained largely by the fact that women with diabetes
had longer LE and significantly higher prevalence of disabil-
ity, which is consistent with previously reported data for wom-
en in general [9, 25].
The relationship between diabetes and disability is likely
due to multiple factors. Many studies have shown that the
greater burden of traditional diabetes complications and
comorbidities [9, 11, 26, 27] and poor glycaemic control
[11, 28] could contribute to the higher risk for disability asso-
ciated with diabetes. Additionally, non-traditional diabetes-re-
lated problems, such as cognitive impairment and sarcopenia
[29–31], could also be the potential mechanisms that cause
disability. The striking loss of DFLE in diabetes reported in
this study is likely to raise concern about the burden of diabe-
tes in future decades, indicating a need to respond by
implementing intervention and prevention of disability.
Evidence has shown that the loss of muscle mass and strength
in diabetes may potentially be improved with insulin
sensitisers [32]. In 2012, the Look AHEAD trial [33] found
that intensive lifestyle intervention with a focus on weight loss
and physical activity reduced the incidence of physical dis-
ability by half among overweight or obese adults with diabe-
tes. Nonetheless, further research is still needed to explore
other mechanisms (e.g. related to obesity or lack of physical
activity) that lead to disability in diabetes. This will help in-
form strategies aimed at prevention and control of disability in
those with diabetes.
When interpreting the results in this study, it is important to
take into account that definitions of severity of disability may
affect the estimates. A wide range of concepts and measures of
disability has been used in the studies on population health. In
the present study, the definition of disability was based on the
conceptual framework of the ICF, which incorporates the med-
ical and social aspects of people’s health condition including all
levels of disability. The definition of severe or profound core
activities limitation is a combination of ADLs, mobility and
communication, including severe and above levels of disability.
There are several advantages of combining data from a
survey of national disability prevalence with a large national
registry of diabetes. The 2012 SDAC was conducted at the
national level using standard definitions of disability, follow-
ing the ICF, thus could provide reliable prevalence estimates
of disability. In addition, the AusDiab study that used an oral
glucose tolerance test to define diabetes provided more defin-
itive data on the true prevalence of diabetes. Since we linked
the diabetes registry to the death index, we identified all deaths
in people with diabetes, not just those identified on death
certificates, which would be an underestimate [34].
There are several limitations that also must be acknowl-
edged. First, our findings on the impact on disability are based
on estimates, rather than on direct measurements, and the
accuracy of these estimates depends on the quality of data
input (e.g. the validity of the RRs for disability associated with
diabetes). The RRs for disability associated with diabetes var-
ied with the definition of severity of disability and none of the
three definitions of disability in Wong et al’s meta-analysis
[14] is consistent with the ICF definition that we used in the
current study. We chose the medium RR [1.65 (95% CI 1.55,
1.74)], which corresponded to the moderate degree of disabil-
ity among the three RRs in the major analysis. This could
introduce bias in the estimates of DFLE, LED and the years
lived with severe or profound core activity limitation.
Although in the sensitivity analyses we found that a higher
RR of 1.82 (95% CI 1.40, 2.36) or lower RR of 1.51 (1.38,
Diabetologia (2016) 59:1437–1445
1443
 1.64) had negligible impact on the results, the potential bias
due to not adjusting RRs for different ages is still present.
Second, type 1 and type 2 diabetes were not distinguished in
this study due to limitations in the data. Given the majority of
diabetes in Australia is type 2 [35], the results in this study
predominantly pertain to type 2 diabetes. The onset of type 1
diabetes is earlier than that of type 2 diabetes, which means a
greater burden of complications and probably a higher risk
of disability. Third, although the NDSS captures 80–90%
of all Australians with known diabetes, it does not include
those with undiagnosed diabetes and it may underrepresent
those with diet-controlled diabetes. The mortality rate in
the population with diabetes in this study might be
overestimated, possibly leading to an underestimation of
LE and DFLE for people with diabetes. Finally, LE and
DFLE were estimated for people with and without diabetes
using a period life table method. Period life table estimates
are summary descriptive measures created from cross-
sectional data of open populations based on the past expe-
rience of the population. Therefore, estimates in this study
should not be used to ‘predict’ LE, DFLE or LED for
individuals, as the mortality and disability experience will
change with time.
In summary, this study suggests that the LE of people with
diabetes has improved but adults with diabetes are still afflicted
with a considerable loss of DFLE. Efforts to identify the spe-
cific causes of disability and effective interventions are needed.
