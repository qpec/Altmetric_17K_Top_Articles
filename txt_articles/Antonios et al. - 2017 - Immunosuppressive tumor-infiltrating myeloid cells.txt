Abstract
Background. Adaptive immune resistance in the tumor microenvironment appears to attenuate the immunothera-
peutic targeting of glioblastoma (GBM). In this study, we identified a tumor-infiltrating myeloid cell (TIM) popula-
tion that expands in response to dendritic cell (DC) vaccine treatment. 
The aim of this study was to understand how 
this programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)–expressing population restricts activation and tumor-cytolytic function of 
vaccine-induced tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).
Methods. To test this hypothesis in our in vivo preclinical model, we treated mice bearing intracranial gliomas with 
DC vaccination ± murine anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) blockade or a colony stimulating factor 1 receptor 
inhibitor (CSF-1Ri) (PLX3397) and measured overall survival. We then harvested and characterized the PD-L1+ 
TIM 
population and its role in 
TIL activation and tumor cytolysis in vitro.
Results. Our data indicated that the majority of PD-L1 expression in the GBM environment is contributed by 
TIMs 
rather than by tumor cells themselves. While PD-1 blockade partially reversed the TIL dysfunction, targeting TIMs 
directly with CSF-1Ri altered TIM expression of key chemotactic factors associated with promoting increased TIL 
infiltration after vaccination. Neither PD-1 mAb nor CSF-1Ri had a demonstrable therapeutic benefit alone, but 
when combined with DC vaccination, a significant survival benefit was observed. When the tripartite regimen was 
given (DC vaccine, PD-1 mAb, PLX3397), long-term survival was noted together with an increase in the number of 
TILs and 
TIL activation.
Conclusion. Together, these studies elucidate the role that TIMs play in mediating adaptive immune resistance in 
the GBM microenvironment and provide evidence that they can be manipulated pharmacologically with agents 
that are clinically available. Development of immune resistance in response to active vaccination in GBM can be 
reversed with dual administration of CSF-1Ri and PD-1 mAb.

Antonios et al. TIMs regulate immune responses in glioblastoma
Neuro-
Oncology
Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most lethal of human 
cancers, with very few long-term survivors and no defini-
tive cures for this disease. Current therapies for GBM are 
largely palliative, and novel treatment strategies, such as 
immunotherapy, suggest promise.1–4 Active vaccination 
strategies have shown enough promise against GBM1,5 
that a randomized, phase III clinical trial utilizing dendritic 
cell (DC) therapy in patients with new diagnoses is cur-
rently under way. In previous studies, however, extended 
survival associated with DC vaccination was variable, with 
evidence suggesting that persistent residual or progressive 
disease may impair the beneficial antitumor response.1,5
Our recent findings, and those of others, suggest that 
antitumor immune responses induced by active vaccina-
tion may be subsequently accompanied by an adaptive 
immune resistance mechanism mediated by signaling of 
programmed death 1 and its ligand (PD-1/PD-L1).6–8 PD-1/
PD-L1 signaling has been documented in GBM,9–11 and 
early studies proposed that tumor cells themselves are the 
dominant expressers of PD-L1.7,12,13 However, PD-L1 is also 
known to be expressed by various cell populations of mye-
loid lineage that are frequently heterogeneously present 
in the tumor microenvironment and not necessarily by the 
tumor cells.14–20
Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cell (TIM) populations have 
been evaluated in a variety of tumor models. The absence 
of these cells appears to lead to markedly depressed tumor 
growth rates,21,22 and the infiltration of tumor-associated 
macrophages appears to increase in response to treat-
ments such as radiation,23 chemotherapy,24 and immuno-
therapies,25 and thereafter promote tumor progression.26–30 
These treatments induce colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-
1) secretion from tumors, which promotes the influx 
of myeloid cells into tumors. Once there, they increase 
expression of T
-cell inhibitory factors, such as prostaglan-
din-E2, transforming growth factor–β, and interleukin (IL)-
10, and promote tumor progression.23,24,31–33 Although 
TIMs 
analyses have been done in gliomas,34–36 the mechanisms 
by which this cell population influences antitumor immu-
nity is largely unknown.
In this study, we identified that functional PD-L1 is mainly 
expressed by an expanded GBM 
TIM population following 
vaccination. We showed that PD-1 monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) blockade diminished the immunoregulatory effects 
of TIMs on the activation of tumor-specific T cells. We also 
showed that while treatment with colony stimulating factor 
1 receptor inhibitor (CSF-1Ri) in our vaccinated GBM model 
did not fully deplete TIMs or abolish PD-L1 expression on 
TIMs, it did promote increased cytokine and chemokine 
signaling by TIMs, and appeared to support an increased 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) influx in both ex vivo 
human GBM and in vivo murine glioma studies. Combined 
adjuvant PD-1 mAb and CSF-1Ri treatment together with 
vaccination significantly enhanced antitumoral immune 
responses in a murine glioma model and our validation 
in ex vivo GBM patient samples. Further, in our murine 
glioma model, these vaccine adjuvants together promoted 
significantly increased survival over treatment with either 
adjuvant alone.
Materials and Methods
Cell Lines and Human Specimens
All murine and human glioma tumor cells were cultured 
using complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium 
(Mediatech) with supplementary 10% fetal bovine serum 
(FBS; Gemini Bio-Products), and 1% (v/v) penicillin and 
streptomycin (Mediatech Cellgro). Cells were then main-
tained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C con-
ditions. The Brain Tumor Translational Resource (BTTR) at 
UCLA provided paraffinized human GBM tissue pre– and 
post–DC vaccine treatment. Fresh tumor samples were 
obtained from patients with newly diagnosed GBM imme-
diately following resection and digested in collagenase for 
24 hours. These patients provided informed consent and 
were participating under our phases I and II DC vaccine 
clinical trials (NCT00068510 and NCT01204684). Patient-
derived biological samples were procured under a UCLA 
Brain 
Tumor Bank protocol that was approved by the insti-
tutional review board. Discontinuous Percoll gradient sep-
aration was used to isolate distinct leukocyte populations 
from tumors. For fresh tumor, patients provided informed 
consent for their tissue to be used for research purposes, 
which was approved by the UCLA Medical Institutional 
Review Board. Additional details are provided in the 
Supplementary material.
Murine Model
GL261 glioma cells (2 × 104 in 2 μL PBS) were stereotac-
tically injected intracranially into female C57BL.6 mice 
Importance of the study
Previous studies have suggested that tumor cells them-
selves are the relevant source of PD-L1 in the tumor 
microenvironment. Our work herein changes this 
paradigm, clearly demonstrating that the meaningful 
contribution of PD-L1 to the glioblastoma tumor micro-
environment is instead from TIMs and that experimen-
tal manipulation of TIMs with PD-1 mAb treatment and 
CSF-1R inhibition can dramatically alter the progres-
sion of tumors and overall survival in animal models. 
It is these cells that actively suppress antitumor T
-cell 
responses, and this fact must be accounted for in order 
to create more effective immunotherapies. Currently, 
there are 2 PD-1 mAbs approved for clinical use; and 
PLX3397
, the CSF-1R inhibitor we utilized in these stud-
ies, is currently in phase III clinical trials. The findings 
presented herein are directly applicable to ongoing and 
upcoming clinical investigations and can be immediately 
applied to our vaccine-treated GBM patient population.

Antonios et al. TIMs regulate immune responses in glioblastoma
(see the Supplementary material). Following intracra-
nial tumor implantation, mice were randomized into 
treatment groups (n = 6–12/group). Mice were obtained 
from the Division of Experimental Radiation Oncology 
at the University of California Los Angeles and housed 
in a defined flora and pathogen free vivarium accredited 
by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of 
Laboratory Animal Care. Animal treatment was compliant 
with the University of California Los Angeles animal care 
policy and approved by the Chancellor’s Animal Research 
Committee.
Generation of Bone Marrow–Derived DC, Pulsing, 
and Vaccination
GL261 glioma cells were harvested and exposed to 3–5 
freeze-thaw cycles. Lysate concentration was quantified 
using a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). DCs were pre-
pared from murine bone marrow progenitor cells and 
pulsed with 250 μg/mL GL261 lysate for 18 hours prior to 
treatment. DCs (1 × 106 cells/mouse) were then adminis-
tered subcutaneously at 4 sites on the dorsal aspect of 
the mouse midbody on days 3 and 13 following tumor 
implantation.
In vivo Treatments and Depletions
Anti–PD-1 mAb (RMP1-14, BioXCell) was administered 
i.p. for 3 days a week at 250 mg/kg/day. Ly6-C (Monts 1, 
BioXCell) and CD8 (Lyt 2.1, BioXcell) depleting antibodies 
were administered i.p. at 200 mg/kg every other day. The 
CSF-1Ri (PLX3397
, Plexxikon) was administered by oral 
gavage at 50 mg/kg/day.
Tumor Tissue Harvests and Flow Cytometry
Mouse tumor-bearing brain hemispheres were harvested 
72 hours following the second DC vaccine treatment and 
prepared for flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) as previously described.37 Fluorochrome conju-
gated antibodies to mouse CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, Ly6-
C, GR-1, CD45.2, CD11b, CD11c, F4/80, CSF-1R, Thy1.2, 
PD-1, and PD-L1 were obtained from eBioscience. World 
Health Organization grades III and IV gliomas were 
obtained from consenting patients shortly after surgi-
cal resection. A minimum of 2 g tissue was obtained for 
this study. A minimum of 1 × 106 TILs were isolated from 
tissue as previously described.37 Fluorochrome conju-
gated antibodies to human CD3, CD8, and CD11b were 
obtained from eBioscience as well. Flow cytometry was 
performed on an LSRII (BD Biosciences), and cell sorting 
was performed with a FACSAria (BD Biosciences). Gates 
were set based on fluorescence minus one (FMO). Data 
were analyzed using FlowJo (Treestar) software. Sorted 
lymphocytes were placed into culture using Roswell 
Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium supplemented 
with 10% FBS and 1% (v/v) penicillin and streptomycin. 
Additional details are provided in the Supplementary 
material.
Immunohistochemistry
Murine tissue was stained via IHC methods with the assis-
tance of the UCLA 
Translational Pathology Core Laboratory 
for CD8 (4SM15, 1:100, eBioscience) and CD11b (M1/70, 
1:100, eBioscience). Human tissue was stained via mul-
tiplex immunofluorescent methods at our facility using 
CD8, CD163, PD-1, PD-L1, and glial fibrillary acidic pro-
tein. Additional details are provided in the Supplementary 
material. Analysis for all tissue—including cell mapping, 
automated total cell count (total 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phe-
nylindole positive [DAPI+]), and cell population counts 
(fluorochrome-positive cells and fluorochrome colocaliza-
tion)—was performed using the Vectra 3.0 (PerkinElmer) 
quantitative pathology imaging system and inForm 
(PerkinElmer) analysis software.
TIL:TIM Transwell Assay
Thy1.2− CD11b+ 
TIMs and 
Thy1.2+ CD3+ 
TILs were subjected 
to fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) from the 
tumor-bearing hemispheres of DC vaccinated mice. TIMs 
were cultured in 24-well plates at 100 
000 cells/well in RPMI 
medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% (v/v) penicillin 
and streptomycin, and 100 IU/mL IL
-2. TILs were added to 
0.40 µm pore polycarbonate membrane transwell inserts at 
TIL:TIM ratios of 1:1 and 10:1. Recombinant murine inter-
feron-gamma (IFNɣ) (Peprotech) was added to media at 
100 or 1000 IU/mL, and a neutralizing IFNɣ mAb (XMG1.2, 
BioXCell) was added to media at 50 µg/mL. All cultures 
were for 24 hours before performing cellular analysis.
Quantitative Transcriptional Profiling
FACS was performed on tumor-infiltrating leukocytes from 
murine brain tumor–bearing hemispheres for Thy1.2− 
CD11b+ TIM and Thy1.2+ CD3+ TIL. RNA was obtained 
using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and analyzed using the 
nCounter GX Nanostring Analysis system (Nanostring 
Technologies), which allows for exact quantification of 
RNA expression via direct binding to tagged probes sam-
pling approximately 770 genes.38,39 Data were then ana-
lyzed using the Nanostring nSolver Analysis software 
(Nanostring 
Technologies).
xCELLigence Real-Time Cytotoxicity Assay
For human ex vivo cytotoxicity studies, CD3+ TILs and 
CD11b+ 
TIMs from surgically resected patient gliomas were 
digested in collagenase and DNAse, enriched on a discon-
tinuous Percoll gradient (30%–70%), subjected to FACS, 
and placed into culture with patient GBM (CD3− CD11b−) 
cells. Because of variation in overall cell count across sam-
ples, tumor cell:TIL:TIM ratio per co-culture was main-
tained at 1:10:1 with a minimum total tumor cell count 
of 5 × 104 and maximum of 1 × 105 cells per culture. For 
murine in vitro cytotoxicity studies, Pmel-1 gp100-specific 
T cells were placed into culture with GL261-gp100 glioma 
cells and FACS-subjected CD11b+ 
TIMs from tumor-bearing 
brain hemispheres of vaccinated mice. For murine studies,

the tumor cell:TIL:TIM ratio was 1:10:1, with a tumor cell 
count maintained at 1 × 105 cells. Where indicated, T
-cell 
media was supplemented with 10 μM anti–PD-1 antibody 
(BioXCell) for 1 hour on ice prior to the addition of T cells 
to xCELLigence assay. Where indicated, TIMs were cul-
tured with 10 µM CSF-1Ri. Tumor cytolysis over 10 hours 
following co-culture was assessed using the xCELLigence 
Real-Time Cell Analyzer System (Acea Biotechnology).40,41 
Afterward, cells from cultures containing tumor cells or 
tumor cells + TIMs were harvested and stained for PD-L1 
expression. 
Tumor cells were identified as CD11b− cells.
In vitro Activation of Pmel-1 T Cells
Spleens and lymph nodes were harvested from Pmel-1 
T
-cell receptor transgenic mice. The organs were pro-
cessed and a single-cell suspension was obtained and 
then cultured with human IL
-2 (100 IU/mL, NCI Preclinical 
Repository, Developmental Therapeutics Program) and 
hgp100 (25–33) peptide (1 µg/mL, NH2-KVPRNQDWL
-OH, 
Biosynthesis) in XVIVO-15 (Lonza) and 2% FBS. After 72 
hours, cells were washed with PBS 1× and cultured in fresh 
media with 100 IU/mL IL
-2 for an additional 3 days prior to 
use in cytotoxicity assays.
CRISPR Knock-out
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat 
knock-out (CRISPR KO) of PD-L1 in the GL261-gp100 cell 
line was performed as described previously.42 Additional 
details are provided in the Supplementary material. 
Transduced cells were purified using puromycin selection 
followed by FACS of PD-L1(−) cells from the puromycin-
resistant population.
Results
GBM-Infiltrating TIMs Inhibit T-Cell Mediated 
Tumor Cytolysis via the PD-1/PD-L1 Axis
Our group has previously shown that the PD-1/PD-L1 
negative costimulatory system reduces the efficacy of 
vaccination-induced immune responses in established 
intracranial tumors. 
To understand the mechanisms under-
lying these cellular interactions, we examined pre- and 
post-vaccinated patient GBM tumor samples using multi-
plex IHC. Surprisingly, we found that the majority of PD-L1 
expression in the tumor microenvironment was present 
on CD163+ cells of myelomonocytic lineage, both pre- 
and post-vaccination (Fig. 1A–F) (Supplementary Fig. 1). 
Interestingly, not only was there an increase in the number 
of TIMs expressing PD-L1 following vaccination (Fig. 1G), 
but the density of TIMs in vaccinated established tumors 
became greater (Fig. 1H). 
TIMs were the dominant contrib-
utors of PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment, especially 
after DC vaccination (Fig. 1I).
In order to interrogate the immunoregulatory effects of 
TIMs, tumor cells and TILs were cultured with or without 
TIMs from freshly resected GBM patient tumor specimens. 
In the presence of TILs, TIMs significantly upregulated 
PD-L1 expression (Fig. 1J). Lysis of patient-derived pri-
mary tumor cells by the autologous TILs was significantly 
reduced in the presence of TIMs, but addition of a PD-1–
blocking mAb to this TIM-TIL
-tumor cell co-culture recov-
ered the lysis to levels identical to cultures without TIMs 
(Fig. 1K, L). Interestingly, in the absence of TIMs, PD-1 
blockade did not provide any additional TIL cytolytic ben-
efit, suggesting that the functional PD-1/PD-L1 interaction 
was predominantly between 
TIMs and 
TILs (Fig. 1l).
In the murine GL261 glioma model, we identified an 
analogous 
CD11b+ 
myelomonocytic 
population 
that 
similarly expanded after DC vaccination in large, estab-
lished tumors (Fig. 2A). These murine TIMs demonstrated 
significantly greater PD-L1 expression compared with 
glioma cells (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Fig 2). This TIM pop-
ulation was further characterized by multicolor FACS as 
non–T
-lymphocyte (Thy1.2−), monocyte lineage (CD11b+ 
and Ly6-C+), Gr-1−, CSF-1R+, and F4/80+ cells (Fig. 2C, D) 
(Supplementary Fig. 3). 
The Ly6-C and F4/80 expression on 
these cells was not affected by the DC vaccination treatment 
(Supplementary Fig. 4). 
To evaluate whether the expression 
of PD-L1 by TIM also suppressed cytotoxic T
-cell activity in 
the murine model, we co-cultured CD11b+ cells sorted by 
FACS from intracranial tumors with GL261-hgp100 glioma 
cells and Pmel-1 hgp100-specific T cells. As seen with 
human GBM, the presence of 
TIMs significantly reduced the 
T
-cell cytolytic ability (Fig. 2E, F) and this could be recov-
ered with PD-1 mAb treatment ex vivo, but PD-1 blockade 
did not have any apparent effect on tumor cell lysis in the 
absence of 
TIMs. 
To confirm that PD-L1 expression by tumor 
cells did not functionally suppress T
-cell mediated tumor 
cytolysis, we created GL261-hgp100 glioma cells in which 
the PD-L1 gene was disrupted. Lysis of control, PD-L1–suf-
ficient GL261 cells was not different when compared with 
PD-L1–deficient CRISPR GL261-hgp100 cells, regardless of 
PD-1 blockade in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 5). These data 
suggested that PD-L1–mediated immune suppression was 
not primarily mediated by tumor cells. Rather, TIMs func-
tionally used this pathway to inhibit T
-cell induced tumor 
cytolysis in the glioma microenvironment.
The Recruitment of TIMs that Express High 
Levels of PD-L1 Is an Adaptive Immune 
Response to Vaccine-Induced TILs in the Glioma 
Microenvironment
These previous results suggested that the antitumor 
immune response induced by DC vaccination also elicited 
a compensatory recruitment of TIMs. As such, we hypoth-
esized that TILs might affect the phenotype of GL261 gli-
oma-infiltrating 
TIMs. 
The addition of IFNɣ to GL261 tumor 
cell cultures did increase PD-L1 expression on those cells, 
but T
-cell lysis of tumor cells in vitro was not affected 
(Supplementary Fig. 6). However, the addition of increas-
ing concentrations of IFNɣ to 
TIMs cultured ex vivo resulted 
in dramatic increases in PD-L1 expression on 
TIMs that was 
proportionally more significant than the PD-L1 upregula-
tion on tumor cells (Fig. 3A). Supernatants from TIM-TIL 
transwell co-cultures were analyzed using a multi-analyte 
cytokine assay, which demonstrated significantly increased

IFNɣ levels with increasing numbers of TILs (Fig. 3B). As a 
result of such 
TIL:TIM co-cultures, there was also a propor-
tional increase in the expression of PD-L1 when TILs were 
increased (Fig. 3C). Neutralization of IFNɣ in these TIM-TIL 
co-cultures completely abolished this TIL
-related PD-L1 
upregulation on TIMs (Fig. 3C). In vivo, post-vaccination 
TIM expansion (Fig. 3D, E) and PD-L1 upregulation on 
these 
TIMs (Fig. 3F) were significantly reduced when CD8+ 
T cells were depleted in vaccinated mice. These results 
suggest that TIM upregulation of PD-L1 was an adaptive 
resistance mechanism elicited by the antitumor activity of 
vaccine-induced IFNɣ-secreting CD8+ TILs.
We next evaluated the corresponding influence of 
TIMs on TILs. Tumor-bearing mice treated with DC vac-
cine, PD-1 blockade, or a Ly6-C mAb that depletes TIMs 
(Supplementary Fig. 7) were assessed for TIL infiltration 
and activation. Although TIM depletion alone did not pro-
mote an infiltrating 
T
-cell response, when it was combined 
with DC vaccination there was a significantly increased 
number of TILs found (Fig. 4A). Activation markers in 
the CD8+ TIL were also significantly elevated, compara-
ble to levels observed with PD-1 mAb blockade (Fig. 4B). 
However, PD-1 mAb blockade in addition to DC vaccine 
with Ly6-C antibody depletion in tumor-bearing mice did 
not provide any additional increase in T
-cell activation 
compared with animals treated with DC vaccine and Ly6-C 
depletion alone. These results demonstrated that TIMs 
mediated 
T
-cell suppression and that blockade of PD-1 was 
functionally similar to depletion of 
TIMs in vivo.
PD-1 mAb and CSF-1Ri Together Maximally 
Enhance the Vaccine-Generated Immune 
Response
Since the in vivo depletion of myeloid cells is not feasible 
clinically, we evaluated whether a small molecule inhibi-
tor of CSF-1R was effective in our model. For our studies, 
we utilized a small molecule CSF-1R inhibitor (PLX3397
, 
Plexxikon). While CSF-1Ri treatment in unvaccinated mice

Antonios et al. TIMs regulate immune responses in glioblastoma
Neuro-
Oncology
did not significantly alter the infiltrating T
-cell response, 
we showed that CSF-1R blockade in vaccinated glioma-
bearing mice led to reduced infiltrating TIM popula-
tions (Supplementary Fig. 7) and significantly increased 
TIL infiltration (Fig. 4A). When compared with the earlier 
experiments with DC vaccine + Ly6-C TIM depletion, these 
effects were more profound. Although DC vaccine + CSF-
1Ri increased overall 
TIL infiltration above that induced by 
DC vaccine treatment alone, it did not significantly alter 
TIL 
activation (Fig. 4B). 
This led us to hypothesize that CSF-1Ri–
treated TIMs affected TILs through mechanisms other than 
PD-L1, as 
TIMs continued to express stable levels of PD-L1 
after treatment with CSF-1Ri (Fig. 4C).
To further understand the increase in the CD3+ TIL pop-
ulation seen with adjuvant CSF-1Ri treatment, we used a 
quantitative transcriptional profiling assay to evaluate the 
gene expression profile of TIMs from mice treated with 
DC vaccination or DC vaccine + CSF-1Ri. An elevation in 
chemotactic, apoptotic, and Janus kinase/signal trans-
ducer and activator of transcription (Jak/STAT) signaling 
factors following CSF-1Ri treatment was observed, which 
could potentially explain the increased 
TIL infiltration find-
ings (Fig. 4D–F). Interestingly, IL
-10 was significantly down-
regulated and other known M1/M2 markers also showed 
decreased expression with CSF-1Ri treatment (Fig. 4G) 
(Supplementary Fig. 8). While other immuno-inhibitory 
factors are also expressed by this population of cells (eg, 
transforming growth factor–β, IL
-6) and could potentially 
contribute to the suppressive milieu of these tumors, our 
data strongly suggest that PD-L1 and IL
-10 play dominant 
roles in our model. These results suggest that CSF-1Ri 
treatment altered the gene expression profile of intra-
tumoral TIM to that which favored the recruitment of T 
lymphocytes.
Based on our findings, CSF-1Ri and PD-1 blockade 
appeared to influence 2 independent aspects of the anti-
tumor immune response. CSF-1Ri promoted an increased 
density of the TIL population generated by the DC vaccine 
treatment, and PD-1 blockade activated the TIL population. 
When combined, these 2 adjuvants were able to synergisti-
cally enhance the DC vaccine treatment. With murine cells, 
there was a significant increase in ex vivo tumor cytolysis

Antonios et al. TIMs regulate immune responses in glioblastoma
with combination therapy compared to treatment with PD-1 
blockade alone (Fig. 5A). In vivo, DC vaccine with PD-1 block-
ade significantly increased survival over DC vaccination 
alone, as did DC vaccine with CSF-1Ri (Fig. 5B). However, 
DC vaccine with CSF-1Ri and PD-1 blockade together sig-
nificantly increased long-term survival of tumor-bearing 
mice compared with mice that received DC vaccination with 
either treatment alone. Importantly, similar effects were 
observed in our ex vivo GBM patient tumor samples. When 
patient GBM-derived TILs were co-cultured with autolo-
gous patient GBM 
TIMs and tumor cells, 
TIL
-mediated tumor 
cytolysis was enhanced with either PD-1 blockade or CSF-
1Ri alone versus nontreated controls. However, we saw a 
further significant increase in TIL
-mediated tumor cytolysis 
with PD-1 mAb and CSF-1Ri combined compared with either 
treatment alone (Fig. 5C, D).
Discussion
We have previously established that vaccination is neces-
sary to generate an infiltrating immune response in a non-
immunogenic cancer such as GBM and that the interaction 
of PD-1–expressing TILs with PD-L1 in the tumor micro-
environment reduces its efficacy.6 Our initial hypothesis 
was that tumor cells mediated this suppression of TILs 
by a PD-1/PD-L1 dependent mechanism as a compensa-
tory reaction to restrict the vaccine-generated immune 
response. However, our data from both patient GBM sam-
ples and murine preclinical models strongly indicate that 
TIMs are responsible for the functional PD-L1 expression 
within the tumor microenvironment. Our in vitro data ini-
tially suggested that both 
TIMs and tumor cells upregulated

PD-L1 in response to IFNɣ. However, tumor cell expression 
of PD-L1 in both intracranial murine brain gliomas and 
patient-derived GBM cells was insignificant compared 
with PD-L1 expression by TIMs. The expression of PD-L1 
by a nontumor cell population, as opposed to the tumor 
cells themselves, within the tumor microenvironment is 
an important distinction. This distinction suggests that 
functional reprogramming of TIMs, instead of tumor cells, 
may be more important for enhancing vaccine approaches 
to GBM. It will likely prove necessary to overcome the local 
inhibitory effects of this cell population to sustain a suc-
cessful antitumor immune response.
We were able to isolate endogenous infiltrating popu-
lations of TILs in patients with newly diagnosed GBM

without prior treatment. When these 
TILs were placed into 
co-culture with GBM tumor cells at a sufficient effector-to-
target ratio, there was significant tumor cytolysis, confirm-
ing that these TILs have the capacity to exert a functional 
tumor-specific response. Given that these tumors pro-
gress despite the accumulation of tumor-specific 
TIL popu-
lations, such 
TILs are clearly not able to mediate significant 
enough tumor cytolysis to halt tumor progression. In our 
clinical and preclinical studies, DC vaccination appears 
capable of boosting the numbers of glioma-infiltrating 
TILs. However, we found that there is a reciprocal TIM 
expansion associated with this treatment. In response to 
TIL
-secreted factors, 
TIMs expand and inhibit 
TIL activation 
and tumor cytolysis directly via the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling 
pathway. The expression of PD-L1 on such TIM popula-
tions suggests that this negative costimulatory pathway 
may dominantly mediate adaptive immune resistance in 
glioma.
Fig. 6 PD-1 mAb blockade and CSF-1R inhibitors enhance vaccine-induced immune responses by distinct mechanisms. (A) Malignant gliomas 
lack a significant antitumor immune response in the nontreatment setting. (B) DC vaccination elicits an infiltrating TIL response, but is largely 
ineffective due to inactivation of TILs via the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling mechanism. (C) Treatment with CSF-1Ri alters the TIM population to become 
pro-inflammatory TIM (pTIM) and results in the expansion of the TIL population, increasing the potential for TIL-tumor cell interaction and tumor 
cytolysis. (D) While PD-1 mAb treatment does not increase the TIL population over what is generated by DC vaccination, it does promote activa-
tion of TILs and subsequent tumor cytolysis. (E) PD-1 mAb and CSF-1Ri together promote the expansion and activation of the DC vaccine-gener-
ated TIL population such that there is a maximal tumor cytolysis.

Antonios et al. TIMs regulate immune responses in glioblastoma
Our studies using the CSF-1R inhibitor PLX3397 gave us 
further insight that TIMs have multiple roles in the tumor 
microenvironment. It should be noted that while “tumor-
associated macrophage” is a commonly used term for 
the myeloid cells we call TIMs, our evidence suggests 
that “macrophage” is too restrictive a term. The glioma-
infiltrating myeloid populations include dendritic cells 
and other myeloid cells in various stages of differentia-
tion within the tumor. Although CSF-1R inhibition did not 
fully deplete the 
TIM population or alter 
TIM PD-L1 expres-
sion, it did alter the gene expression signature of these 
cells. TIMs from mice treated with DC vaccine and CSF-
1Ri showed elevated chemokine, cytokine, and Jak/STAT 
transcripts. 
The sum total effect of these pathways may be 
to enhance TIL recruitment and expansion. Future thera-
pies might be utilized to transform these inhibitory cell 
populations to support a continued antitumor immune 
response.
Interestingly, PD-1 mAb blockade or CSF-1Ri treat-
ment together with DC vaccination promote significantly 
increased survival. 
The evidence suggests that each treat-
ment targets a different aspect of the antitumor immune 
response (Fig. 6). When PD-1 mAb blockade is used in 
conjunction with DC vaccination, we observed increased 
activation of TILs. When we used a CSF-1R inhibitor in 
conjunction with DC vaccination, we saw an expansion 
of the 
TIL population and an altered pro-inflammatory 
TIM 
(pTIM) population. Independently, each adjuvant treat-
ment enhances one aspect of the DC vaccine–induced 
immune response. Together, however, these 2 treatments 
may both activate and expand the TIL population such 
that there is significant increase in tumor cytolysis and 
survival.
The translational relevance of these adjuvant treatments 
was confirmed with both elevated tumor cytolysis in ex 
vivo patient GBM cultures and significantly prolonged sur-
vival in our preclinical murine glioma model. Classically 
M2-associated genes were downregulated in TIMs from 
CSF-1Ri–treated mice, in large agreement with other recent 
studies.43,44 However, to our knowledge, this study repre-
sents the first time that both PD-1 mAb and CSF-1Ri have 
been used together to enhance the active vaccination 
strategy in an immune-competent murine glioma model. 
Currently, there are 2 PD-1 mAbs approved for clinical 
use,45–47 and PLX3397
, the CSF-1R inhibitor we utilized in 
these studies, is currently in phase III clinical trials. As such, 
we consider the findings in this study to be directly appli-
cable to clinical investigations and propose that such adju-
vant treatments be directly applied to our vaccine-treated 
GBM patient population. In non-immunogenic cancers 
that clearly need an active vaccination strategy to gener-
ate an immune response, such as glioma, this combina-
tion treatment may provide an exciting avenue for therapy 
by both enhancing and activating immunity in the tumor 
microenvironment.
