BACKGROUND: Patient blood management (PBM)
programs are associated with improved patient
outcomes, reduced transfusions and costs. In 2008, the
Western Australia Department of Health initiated a
comprehensive health-system–wide PBM program. This
study assesses program outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a
retrospective study of 605,046 patients admitted to four
major adult tertiary-care hospitals between July 2008
and June 2014. Outcome measures were red blood cell
(RBC), fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), and platelet units
transfused; single-unit RBC transfusions; pretransfusion
hemoglobin levels; elective surgery patients anemic at
admission; product and activity-based costs of
transfusion; in-hospital mortality; length of stay; 28-day
all-cause emergency readmissions; and hospital-
acquired complications.
RESULTS: Comparing final year with baseline, units of
RBCs, FFP
, and platelets transfused per admission
decreased 41% (p< 0.001), representing a saving of
AU$18,507,092 (US$18,078,258) and between AU$80
million and AU$100 million (US$78 million and US$97
million) estimated activity-based savings. Mean
pretransfusion hemoglobin levels decreased 7.9 g/dL to
7.3 g/dL (p< 0.001), and anemic elective surgery
admissions decreased 20.8% to 14.4% (p5 0.001).
Single-unit RBC transfusions increased from 33.3% to
63.7% (p< 0.001). There were risk-adjusted reductions in
hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.72; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.67-0.77; p< 0.001), length of stay (incidence
rate ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.84-0.87; p< 0.001), hospital-
acquired infections (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.73-0.86;
p< 0.001), and acute myocardial infarction-stroke (OR,
0.69; 95% CI, 0.58-0.82; p< 0.001). All-cause emergency
readmissions increased (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10;
p5 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Implementation of a unique, jurisdiction-
wide PBM program was associated with improved patient
outcomes, reduced blood product utilization, and product-
related cost savings.
T
he term patient blood management (PBM) was
coined in 2005 to help bring about a realignment
of transfusion practice from product focus to
patient focus.1,2 PBM is an evidence-based bun-
dle of care that optimizes medical and surgical patient
outcomes

 patient’s blood.2-5 In 2010, the World Health Assembly rec-
ommended PBM to its member states by resolution; as a
result, PBM is high on international health agendas.6-8 PBM
is most effective when it is part of a multidisciplinary
program.6,9,10 The Australian national Patient Blood
Management Guidelines contain an evidence-based rec-
ommendation that health care services should establish
a multidisciplinary, multimodal PBM program; and The
Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health
Care has recently listed the National Patient Blood Man-
agement Collaborative as a top national priority and also
has included PBM in hospital accreditation.11-13
A programmatic approach to PBM has been associat-
ed with improved patient and economic outcomes and
reductions in transfusion.14-21 However, those programs
focused on specific surgical procedures, implemented
selected PBM strategies, or were confined to individual
institutions. Several challenges to wider implementation
of PBM have been identified, namely, clinicians’ resistance
to change; a broader systems approach; needed resources;
engagement of senior leadership across the health system;
changes across the whole patient pathway, including
primary care; translating evidence-based guidelines into
clinical practice; and linking patient, laboratory, and
transfusion databases to report on outcomes.6,22-25
After the successful implementation in 1990 of a
blood-conservation program in one of the state’s private
hospitals,1,26 in 2008, the Western Australia Department of
Health initiated a 5-year project to implement a compre-
hensive,
sustainable
health-system–wide
PBM
pro-
gram.6,27 This was fundamentally a quality, safety, and
effectiveness initiative with resource and economic impli-
cations. Implementing a PBM program across an entire
health system required a redesign of clinical processes
and culture change at all levels of the health care organi-
zation.25,28 Implementation was based on a predefined
program design incorporating successful hospital-based
models and change management principles. Its primary
aim was “improving medical and surgical patient out-
comes while achieving significant cost savings” by apply-
ing PBM principles.6,27
Western Australia is an Australian state with a popula-
tion of approximately 2.6 million, with 74% living in the
capital, Perth. There are five major public tertiary-care
hospitals, four adult and one pediatric, which consume
almost 60% of the blood products issued to the state. In
the financial year 2008-2009, the Western Australia red
blood cell (RBC) issuance rate was 31.8 per 1000 popula-
tion, one of the lowest reported rates in the developed
world (issuance rates for Germany, Denmark, and United
Kingdom were 57.3, 60.0, and 36.3 per 1000, respectively,
and the transfusion rate in the United States was 48.8 per
1000).6,29 However, from financial years 2002-2003 to
2008-2009, total RBC unit issues to the Western Australia
state rose 12% and were projected to continue rising over
the next 4 years, largely due to the rapidly growing and
aging population.6 Data showed that 88% of all RBC trans-
fusions were one to three units, suggesting that consider-
able numbers of transfusions could be preempted with
PBM,30 thus avoiding the unintended negative conse-
quences31,32 and inherent risks of transfusion22,33 along
with the associated costs.34 With commencement of the
program, the upward issuance trend was arrested and
decreased each year thereafter despite average annual
increases of 3% in population and 6% in hospital
discharges. In the fincancial year 2015-2016, the RBC issu-
ance rate per 1000 population decreased to a low of 19.4
(Fig. 1).
This retrospective, observational study assessed what
impact the jurisdiction-wide PBM program had on key
outcome measures in all emergency and elective acute-
care adult inpatients admitted to the four major adult
metropolitan tertiary hospitals where the majority of
emergency care and high-complexity procedures and
interventions are performed, including the major trauma,
burns, and obstetrics referral services for Western Austra-
lia (see Appendix S1, available as supporting information
in the online version of this paper).

 achieve improved patient outcomes with the corollary of
reducing RBC, fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), and platelet
transfusions and costs.3,6,27,34,37 Clinical implementation
was built around a three-pillar, nine-field matrix with
principles applied equally to surgical and nonsurgical
patients (Fig. 2).6,27 The strategies employed included the
following:
Pillar 1. Optimize RBC mass
Systems were re-engineered to facilitate timely preinter-
vention patient assessment and optimization of hemoglo-
bin and iron stores, and the use of intravenous iron and
other hematinics for postoperative and in-hospital anemia
as well as anemia and iron deficiency in pregnancy and
primary care.26,38

 Pillar 2. Minimize blood loss
Educational and clinical initiatives were undertaken to
reduce blood loss, including preintervention bleeding risk
assessment and management, surgical hemostasis work-
shops and symposia, use of blood-preserving anesthetic
techniques, hemostatic agents, autologous blood salvage,
viscoelastic coagulation testing with targeted therapy in
critical bleeding and coagulopathy, and minimize labora-
tory blood sampling volumes.26,38
Pillar 3. Optimize the patient-specific tolerance of
anemia
No specific transfusion threshold values were established
for the program. Transfusion decisions were encouraged
to take into account patient-specific clinical and physio-
logical factors and accept evidence-based, more restrictive
but
individualized
thresholds.38
A
single-unit
RBC
transfusion policy was adopted in symptomatic, nonac-
tively bleeding anemic patients.26,38
Implementation of the program was planned in
stages, with PBM staff to be appointed in Year 1 at the five
tertiary-care hospitals and further state leadership and
hospital and health service staff to be appointed in Years
2 and 3.27 However, the global financial crisis resulted in
delays and cancellations of staff employment and modifi-
cations to implementation and program structure.1,6 PBM
staff were appointed only in the four adult tertiary-care
hospitals, and 2013-2014 was the first full year in which
the program operated with these positions filled.

 implementation, including educational information on the
website, a patient fact sheet, a hospital open day, and
patient informed consent/refusal (see Appendix S1).
Data sources
The data included in this study were sourced from the
Western Australia PBM data system. This automated
reporting system does not use a probabilistic linkage.
Details of the linking are published elsewhere.39 The sys-
tem links data from five core hospital information sys-
tems: laboratory (ULTRA LIS), transfusion (ULTRA TM),
patient administration (TOPAS and WebPAS), theatre
(surgical) management (TMS), and emergency depart-
ment (EDIS), creating a detailed view of patient character-
istics
and
outcomes
associated
with
anemia
and
transfusion practices. The study included all emergency
and elective multiday stay inpatients aged 16 years and
older who were admitted to the four adult tertiary-care
hospitals in Western Australia between July 2008 and June
2014, including major trauma, burns, obstetrics, hematol-
ogy and oncology, gastroenterology, and all major surgery,
including cardiac and major organ transplantation sur-
gery. Because of changes in hospital configuration in early
2015, it was not possible to make comparisons with the
baseline year beyond June 2014.
The study was reviewed by the Department of Health
Western Australia Human Research Ethics Committee and
complied with the national guidelines for research.
Outcome measures
Five primary key program-performance indicators and four
primary hospital-wide patient outcome measures were
selected before our analysis. Performance indicators were:
mean RBC, FFP
, and platelet units transfused per inpatient
discharge; mean pretransfusion hemoglobin; proportion of
single-unit RBC transfusions; proportion of elective surgical
patients admitted anemic (hemoglobin level <13.0 g/dL for
men and <12.0 g/dL for women); and cost of blood prod-
uct acquisition. Operating room transfusions and patients
identified as bleeding were excluded from the single-unit
and pretransfusion hemoglobin measures. Costs were
based on the yearly prices charged by the National Blood
Authority (Australia) under the National Blood Agreement
and were calculated by product type (see Appendix S1).
Conversion to US dollars was based on the average yearly
exchange rate.
The patient outcome measures selected were in-
hospital mortality, hospital length of stay, 28-day all-cause
emergency readmissions, and hospital-acquired complica-
tions; namely, infection and composite acute myocardial
infarction (AMI)-stroke (a composite chosen because of the
low incidence of each). Hospital-acquired complications
were identified using data coded according to the Interna-
tional Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related
Problems, Tenth Revision, Australian Modification (ICD-10).
These codes include a condition-onset flag to distinguish
between hospital-acquired diagnoses and comorbidities
present on admission in routinely coded administrative
data. We defined emergency readmissions as any inpatient
who was readmitted within 28 days of discharge. A prede-
fined secondary measure selected was an estimation of gross
savings based on published calculations of activity-based
cost of transfusion.
Because the purpose of the study was to measure the
potential impact of the PBM program over time, the key
exposure of interest was the discharging Australian finan-
cial year (July 1 to June 30), with July 1, 2008 to June 30,
2009 as the baseline comparator.
Statistical analysis
A multivariate analysis was performed and adjusted for
the following potential confounders: hospital, patient age,
sex, admission type (elective or emergency), Diagnosis-
Related Group (DRG) category (medical, surgical, or
other), indigenous status, and patient comorbidities.
These confounders were chosen to control for the possible
effects of any changes in patient case-mix on patient out-
comes over the study period. Continuous variables were
not grouped into categories. Patient comorbidities were
given a score based on the Charlson Comorbidity Index
(CCI). The ICD-10 version of the CCI, as described by
Quan and colleagues was applied, with hospital-acquired
diagnoses excluded.40
Poisson regression analysis was used to evaluate the
rate of blood units transfused per discharge over time and
to calculate the rate ratios. Linear regression was used to
test the relationship between the year of discharge and the
mean pretransfusion hemoglobin level. Logistic regression
was used to test changes in the proportion of single-unit
RBC transfusions, elective surgical patients admitted ane-
mic, in-hospital mortality, hospital-acquired complications,
and emergency readmissions. A zero-truncated, negative
binomial regression was used to model the data for analysis
of the impact on hospital length of stay. A robust variance
adjustment was applied in the regression models to
account for correlation between multiple admissions for
the same patient.
RESULTS
Overall, 605,046 inpatient admissions were included in
the 6-year study. The mean patient age was 55.4 years
(standard deviation, 21.7 years), and 51.4% of patients
(n5 311,214) were women. Of these admissions 7.8% of
patients (n 5 47,382) received at least one unit of
RBCs, FFP
, or platelets, for a total of 152,636 RBC units,
46,030 FFP units, and 28,089 platelet units transfused
(Table 1).

41% in RBC units (RR, 0.59, 95% CI 0.58-0.60; p < 0.001),
47% in FFP units (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.51-0.55; p < 0.001),
and 27% in units of platelets transfused (RR, 0.73; 95% CI,
0.70-0.76; p < 0.001).
Pretransfusion hemoglobin, single-unit RBC
transfusions, and patients admitted anemic
The mean RBC pretransfusion hemoglobin level decreased
from a baseline mean level of 7.9 g/dL to 7.3 g/dL
(p < 0.001) in Year 6. The proportion of single-unit RBC
transfusions increased from 33.33% to 63.69% (p < 0.001).
The proportion of elective surgical patients admitted ane-
mic decreased from 20.81% to 14.42% (p 5 0.001).
Product-acquisition cost savings
Historic data and forward projections at program design
predicted that, without practice change, product utiliza-
tion would continue to increase. Adopting a conservative
approach, if the annual rate of transfusion remained at
baseline year levels, then an additional 50,115 units of
blood would have been transfused over the study period,
comprising 35,423 RBC units, 10,721 of FFP units, and
3970 platelets units. Based on product-acquisition cost,
the calculated savings from this reduction is $18,507,092
in Australian dollars (AU$) and $18,078,258 in US dollars
($US).

 Estimation of activity-based cost of transfusion
savings
Activity-based costs of RBC transfusion reportedly are
threefold to fivefold higher than-acquisition costs,41,42 and
it has been determined that the cost of FFP is more than
nine times the cost of product acquisition.43 Activity-
based costs of platelets are currently unknown. Using
these published calculations, the gross savings in this 6-
year
study
are
estimated
at between
AU$80M and
AU$100M (between US$78M and US$97M).
Hospital-wide patient outcomes
Unadjusted and adjusted patient outcomes are presented
by year in Table 2. Unadjusted in-hospital mortality
decreased from 2.0% in 2008-2009 to 1.7% in 2013-2014
(p < 0.001). After adjusting for potential confounders, this
represented a 28% reduction (p < 0.001).
The mean length of stay decreased significantly over
the study period (5.9 days vs 5.3 days; p < 0.001). After
adjusting for confounders, the mean length of stay was
reduced by 15% (p < 0.001).
The
proportion
of
all-cause,
28-day
emergency
readmissions increased from 11.4% to 12.4%. After adjust-
ment, this represented a 6% increase (p 5 0.001).
Hospital-acquired complications were analyzed for
two of the study hospitals, because data were incom-
plete for the others. Data also were missing from the
baseline year, because reporting began in the year
2009-2010.
The
unadjusted
incidence
of
hospital-
acquired infections in the two hospitals decreased from
2.3% in 2009-2010 to 2.0% in 2013-2014, representing a
21%
reduction
after
adjusting
for
confounders
(p < 0.001). The incidence of AMI-stroke decreased from
0.5% to 0.4%, representing a 31% reduction after adjust-
ing for confounders (p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION
The implementation of a health-system–wide PBM pro-
gram was associated in four adult public tertiary hospitals
within that health system with significant reductions in hos-
pital mortality, length of stay, RBC, FFP
, and platelet transfu-
sions, considerable
product-acquisition
and
estimated
activity-based transfusion cost savings, and an increase in
all-cause emergency readmissions. There were significant
reductions in infection and AMI-stroke at the two institu-
tions that coded hospital-acquired complications.
Reduced blood product utilization in this study was
associated
with
product-acquisition
cost
savings
of
AU$18.5M (US$18.1M). However, gross savings include
activity-based costs of transfusion,41-44 which are estimat-
ed in this 6-year study at between AU$80M and AU$100M
(US$78M and US$97M). These costs, both acquisition and
activity-based, are jointly borne by the state and federal
governments.6 A one-time investment of AU$4.5M was
made to cover the health-system–wide, 5-year change
management and implementation process. This included
funds for external PBM experts to plan, coordinate, and
guide the project; a state PBM Medical Director (0.1 full-
time equivalent); a state PBM Clinical Nurse Coordinator
(0.5 full-time equivalent); Department of Health project
officers
(providing
administrative
and
data
support,
including creating a sustainable PBM data and reporting
system); and honoraria and travel support for national
and international key opinion leaders in PBM to clinically
support the implementation process. This budget covered

 various other items, including attendance at conferences,
educational sessions, and study tours.
Relation to other studies
The present study is novel, in that it reports on multicen-
ter, hospital-wide outcomes associated with the world’s
first comprehensive health-system–wide PBM program.
The program employed multiple, evidence-based PBM
clinical strategies and used culture change methodology,
systems and patient pathway re-engineering, and contin-
uous automated data collection and feedback. Its findings
are consistent with and strengthen the findings of others
who have examined the impact of either individual
PBM strategies or PBM programs in selected patient
groups.14-17,20,45
Goodnough
and
colleagues
reported
reductions in mortality and length of stay associated with
their
single-hospital–wide
intervention
to
implement
more restrictive RBC transfusion practices, with millions
of dollars in cost savings.17 Their findings correlate with a
systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized con-
trol trials by Salpeter and colleagues demonstrating that
trials with more restrictive transfusion thresholds signifi-
cantly reduced cardiac events, infection, rebleeding, and
mortality compared with trials that used less restrictive
thresholds.46 Large numbers of risk-adjusted observation-
al studies have demonstrated an independent dose-
dependent association between RBC transfusion and
increased morbidity, including infection, AMI-stroke, and
hospital length of stay, and mortality.38,47-58 There is limit-
ed evidence for the efficacy of FFP transfusions in most
clinical situations, likely contributing to overuse and
adverse patient outcomes.38,59 Platelet transfusions may
be associated with adverse events, there is low-quality evi-
dence to guide practice, and they are often inappropriate-
ly used.23,38,60
Although we observed an already relatively restrictive
mean RBC transfusion threshold become more restrictive,
the Western Australia program was not primarily an
appropriate
or
restrictive
transfusion
initiative.30
It
adopted a comprehensive application of the three pillars
of PBM.26,30 These pillars aim to modify the triad of risk
factors for adverse patient outcomes and preempt what
could otherwise result in an “appropriate” transfusion.30
When an RBC transfusion is indicated, a single-unit policy
may reduce the exposure dose.
Increases in anemia and blood loss are independently
associated with poorer outcomes and increase the likeli-
hood of transfusion.15,61,62 PBM programs in surgical
patients have shown an association between improved ane-
mia management and reduced blood loss, and improved
outcomes. Kotze and colleagues observed significantly
reduced preoperative anemia incidence and blood loss in
their orthopedic surgery program with an associated reduc-
tion
in
transfusions.15
Gross
and
colleagues
noted
significantly reduced blood loss and increased mean dis-
charge hemoglobin levels despite a more restrictive transfu-
sion
threshold
in
cardiac
surgery.16
Program
implementation was associated with significant reductions
in RBC, FFP
, and platelet transfusion as well as product
costs. Both programs were associated with improved
patient outcomes.
It is not possible to determine the effect of any one
strategy used within the Western Australia PBM program;
likely a combination of strategies contributed to the modi-
fication of risk factors. The multifaceted multimodal multi-
disciplinary team approach adopted has been shown to be
effective in change management and clinical improve-
ment.63 Up-to-date, evidence-based education and prac-
tice feedback played key roles (Appendix S1). Evaluation
forms completed at more than 60 departmental PBM road
shows revealed that 82% of responders said there was
information that was new to them, 69% said they would
change their clinical practice based on evidence presented,
and 13% said they would not change their practice; the
main reason provided for the latter response was that the
information reinforced their already conservative practice.
The provision of benchmarking data to hospitals, depart-
ments, and individual clinicians also gave strong motiva-
tion for practice improvement.6,39,64
The current study differs from others in finding an
increase in all-cause emergency readmissions.15-17,21 Lof-
tus and colleagues reported a significant reduction in 30-
day readmissions in a multicenter study of patients under-
going total hip and knee arthroplasty.21 Gross and col-
leagues observed a nonsignificant reduction in 30-day
readmission in a single-center study of patients undergo-
ing cardiac surgery.16 In a single center study of primary
hip and knee arthroplasties, Kotze and colleagues identi-
fied a significant reduction in 90-day readmissions.15
Goodnough and colleagues, in a single-center study of a
hospital-wide initiative, found that 30-day readmission
rates remained stable.17 Although this measure is com-
monly used in clinical research, it has limitations in inter-
pretation. Future subgroup analyses may provide insights
into which clinical contexts have higher or lower readmis-
sion rates. However, because this outcome measures all-
cause emergency readmissions, we are unable to deter-
mine the number of patients who were readmitted for rea-
sons unrelated to their previous admission. Given this
limitation, we recommend caution, as have others, in
interpreting this result as an indicator of quality of care.65
Strengths and weaknesses of this study
Because this was an observational study in which a linked
data system was used, it has both strengths and limitations.
A strength is that exposures, outcomes, and covariates were
sourced from validated hospital data systems, which
undergo regular quality audits. It also included a large,

1354

Volume 57, June 2017
 multicenter population of all acute-care, adult inpatients. A
limitation is that there was no control group, because we
sought to measure change over time, and comparisons
were based on a baseline year. We were also unable to
compare outcomes with other Australian jurisdictions,
because we had no access to equivalent patient outcomes
data. Comparisons with other Australian jurisdictions
would have been problematic because during the same
period other states had implemented various PBM initia-
tives, Australia released its national PBM guidelines, and
PBM was included in national hospital accreditation.
An observational study in itself cannot establish a
causal link between program implementation and out-
comes of interest. Nor can outcomes be attributed
completely to the PBM program, as other hospital initia-
tives may have played a role. However, the greatest reduc-
tion in blood utilization was in the only year in which all
study hospitals had their PBM Medical Director and PBM
Nurse—positions that have been identified as key to a
successful PBM program.6
Improvements in patient outcomes, including length
of stay, mortality, and hospital-acquired complications,
were significant even after adjusting for potential con-
founders, reducing the likelihood that they were due to
changes in patient mix. We adopted a similar approach to
that used by Goodnough and colleagues, who reported
concurrent hospital-wide outcomes associated with a
single-hospital–wide intervention.17
Implications for clinicians and policymakers
Blood transfusion is one of the most frequently performed
therapeutic procedures; it crosses many medical disci-
plines, has been identified as one of the top five overused
therapies, and is associated with negative patient out-
comes
and increased costs.17,31,37,66,67 Therefore, the
impact of PBM programs may be substantial considering
the global health sector’s challenge to improve patient
outcomes with increasingly restricted funding.
Unanswered questions and future research
Cost-saving calculations in this study were based on blood
product utilization but did not include the impact of the
program on other modalities, for example, iron therapy in
anemia management, and cryoprecipitate (or fibrinogen
concentrate) and antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid
in
coagulopathy.
A
comprehensive,
cost-effectiveness
analysis would include these modalities and the savings
associated
with
reduced
complications
and
hospital
length of stay.37 This assessment was beyond the scope of
this study and will be the subject of future analysis.
One way to confirm the findings of this and other
studies on the impact of PBM would be to conduct a clus-
ter,
randomized
controlled
trial
to
assess
complex,
process-of-care interventions. However, such an assess-
ment may not be possible for ethical reasons alone;
currently, it would appear to be almost impossible in
developed countries with wide uptake of PBM. For exam-
ple, many authoritative international bodies—including
the AABB, the Joint Commission, and the Advisory Com-
mittee on Blood Safety and Availability in the United
States; European Union Patient Blood Management, the
National Health Service Blood and Transplant, Depart-
ment of Health, and National Blood Transfusion Commit-
tee in the United Kingdom; the Ontario Nurse Transfusion
Coordinators (ONTraC) Program in Canada; and the Aus-
tralian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care
and the National Blood Authority in Australia—have vari-
ous PBM initiatives and are promoting it as a standard of
care to improve outcomes.4-6,8,68-70 However, replicating
the current findings across another jurisdiction would
provide additional evidence for the overall benefits of
such a program.
CONCLUSIONS
In a health system with one of the world’s lowest RBC
issuance rates per 1000 population and an already rela-
tively restrictive mean RBC transfusion threshold, a com-
prehensive, jurisdiction-wide PBM program in the study
hospitals was associated with significant hospital-wide
reductions in morbidity, mortality, length of stay, blood
product use, and costs. The decreasing blood product
issuance rates highlight the finding that, since conclusion
of the 5-year project, the culture generated by the PBM
program in Western Australia has been sustained. These
findings may have considerable implications for health
systems across the globe, including high-income and low-
income countries.
