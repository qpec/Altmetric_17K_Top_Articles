Narcolepsy-cataplexy is a debilitating disorder of sleep/wakefulness
caused by a loss of orexin-producing neurons in the lateroposterior
hypothalamus. Genetic or pharmacologic orexin replacement ame-
liorates symptoms in mouse models of narcolepsy-cataplexy. We
have recently discovered a potent, nonpeptide OX2R-selective
agonist, YNT-185. This study validates the pharmacological activity
of this compound in OX2R-transfected cells and in OX2R-expressing
neurons in brain slice preparations. Intraperitoneal, and intracere-
broventricular, administration of YNT-185 suppressed cataplexy-like
episodes in orexin knockout and orexin neuron-ablated mice, but not
in orexin receptor-deficient mice. Peripherally administered YNT-
185 also promotes wakefulness without affecting body temperature
in wild-type mice. Further, there was no immediate rebound sleep
after YNT-185 administration in active phase in wild-type and orexin-
deficient mice. No desensitization was observed after repeated
administration of YNT-185 with respect to the suppression of
cataplexy-like episodes. These results provide a proof-of-concept
for a mechanistic therapy of narcolepsy-cataplexy by OX2R agonists.

O
rexins (orexin-A and orexin-B, also called hypocretins) are
neuropeptides produced by neurons exclusively localized to
the lateral hypothalamus that act on two G protein-coupled re-
ceptors termed OX1R and OX2R (1). Orexin-producing neu-
rons send axons diffusely through the central nervous system,
with especially dense innervations to several nuclei involved in
sleep/wakefulness regulation (2, 3). Because orexins have been
implicated in the maintenance of wakefulness, many groups are
trying to develop nonpeptidic orexin receptor antagonists aiming
at new medication for insomnia. Recently, suvorexant, a dual
orexin receptor antagonist, was clinically approved in Japan and
the United States (4, 5).
A crucial role of the orexin system in the regulation of sleep/
wakefulness was initially uncovered by the discovery that OX2R-
deficient dogs (6) and prepro-orexin knockout (Hcrt−/−, abbre-
viated as OXKO) mice (2) exhibited symptoms resembling hu-
man narcolepsy-cataplexy. According to the clinical definition by
the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-Third Edi-
tion, two types of narcoleptic disorders are categorized (7).
Narcolepsy type 1 is characterized by the existence of cataplexy
and low levels of orexin-A in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (8–10).
However, patients with narcolepsy type 2 show no cataplexy and
normal orexin-A levels in CSF. Narcolepsy-cataplexy, or narco-
lepsy type 1 (11), is characterized by a marked instability of sleep/
wake state transitions, resulting in nonrapid eye movement
(NREM) sleep-related symptoms (e.g., excessive daytime sleep-
iness, “sleep attacks,” and fragmented nighttime sleep), and
rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-related symptoms (e.g., cat-
aplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucina-
tions). In polysomnography, narcolepsy-cataplexy patients show
markedly reduced daytime sleep latency, and sleep-onset REM
periods (SOREMs). Currently available treatments for narcolepsy-
cataplexy are all symptom-oriented, including psychostimulants (e.g.,
methylphenidate and modafinil), sedative (sodium oxybate), and
tricyclic antidepressants. However, the use of these medications is
often limited by adverse side effects such as headache, nausea,
anxiety, irritability, and insomnia.
Murine models of narcolepsy-cataplexy include OXKO mice
(2), orexin receptor-deficient (Hcrtr1−/−;Hcrtr2−/−, abbreviated as
OXRDKO) mice, and the orexin/ataxin-3 transgenic mice (in
which orexin neurons are genetically and postnatally ablated)
(12). Tabuchi et al. created another narcolepsy mouse model,
which expressed diphtheria toxin A in orexin neurons under
control of the Tet-off system, leading to conditional ablation of
orexin neurons (13). These mouse models exhibit full symptoms
of narcolepsy-cataplexy, including frequent “behavioral arrests”
in the dark (active) phase, highly fragmented wakefulness on
electroencephalography/electromyography (EEG/EMG), and
SOREMs. Importantly, whereas OX2R-deficient mice exhibit
symptoms of narcolepsy-cataplexy, OX1R-deficient mice show
no appreciable sleep/wakefulness-related phenotype, suggesting
that OX2R signaling is particularly important for stabilizing
sleep/wake state transitions. Symptoms of murine narcolepsy-
cataplexy could be reversed either by ectopic production of
orexin peptides from prepro-orexin transgene or by pharmaco-
logical administration of orexin-A (14), indicating that orexin
receptors, their intracellular signaling, and the downstream
neural pathways remain functionally intact even after prolonged,
Significance
Narcolepsy-cataplexy is a debilitating disorder characterized by
excessive daytime sleepiness (sleep attacks) and cataplexy, a
sudden bilateral loss of muscle tone often triggered by emo-
tion. The disease is caused by a selective loss of hypothalamic
neurons producing the neuropeptide orexin. Currently, only
symptomatic therapies are available for narcolepsy. Here, we
examine the pharmacological effect of YNT-185, a nonpeptide,
selective agonist for the orexin type-2 receptor in mouse
models of narcolepsy-cataplexy. We show that peripheral ad-
ministration of YNT-185 significantly ameliorates the narco-
lepsy symptoms in model mice, providing a proof-of-concept
for the mechanistic treatment of narcolepsy with orexin re-
ceptor agonists. YNT-185 also promotes wakefulness in wild-
type mice, suggesting that orexin receptor agonists may be
useful for treating sleepiness due to other causes.

PHARMACOLOGY
 complete orexin deficiency. Although these results suggest that
orexin replacement could be an effective mechanistic therapy,
orexins do not efficiently cross the blood–brain barrier (15) and
are therefore difficult to use as a clinical drug. Because de-
ficiency of OX2R signaling is primarily responsible for sleepiness
and cataplexy-like episodes (6, 16–18), nonpeptidic OX2R ago-
nists are promising candidates for a therapeutic agent to treat
narcolepsy. We recently discovered a potent nonpeptidic OX2R
agonist, YNT-185 (compound 30 in ref. 19), through a lead
optimization process. This compound is an orthosteric, full ag-
onist for OX2R (19) (Fig. 1 B–D). In this study, we performed
the pharmacological and electrophysiological characterization of
YNT-185 and evaluated its effect on sleep/wake states in murine
models of narcolepsy.
Results and Discussion
Activity of YNT-185 on Orexin Receptors in Transfected Cells. We
used Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing hu-
man OX1R and OX2R (CHO/hOX1R, CHO/hOX2R) for
evaluation of YNT-185 activity. YNT-185 induced intracellular
Ca2+ mobilization in a dose-dependent manner with EC50 = 28 ±
4 nM in hOX2R and 2,750 nM in OX1R expressing cells, re-
spectively (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the compound is selective for
OX2R over OX1R by ∼100-fold (19). In CHO/hOX2R cells,
suvorexant (4) caused a dose-dependent, parallel rightward shift
in the dose–response curve to YNT-185 (Fig. 1C). The pA2 and
Schild slope values of suvorexant are 6.8 and 0.8, respectively.
The OX2R-selective antagonist EMPA (20) also caused a dose-
dependent rightward shift in the concentration response curve to
YNT-185 (Fig. 1D). At higher antagonist concentrations, the
maximal response was slightly reduced, but Schild slope was not
different from unity. The pA2 and Schild slope values of EMPA
are 7.4 and 1.1, respectively. Given that EMPA and suvorexant
bind to the OX2R with high affinity and antagonize orexin-
induced transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration
through a competitive mechanism (20), these results show that
YNT-185 acts as an orthosteric, full agonist for OX2R. These
results are consistent with our previous report, which indicated
that YNT-185 displaced [125I] orexin-A binding to OX2R in a
dose-dependent manner (19).
Effects of YNT-185 on OX2R-Expressing Neurons. Histaminergic neu-
rons in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) abundantly express
OX2R, which plays an important role in the maintenance of
wakefulness (16). Electrophysiological properties of histamin-
ergic neurons in the TMN in mice have been well characterized,
and orexin-A was shown to increase firing rates of these neu-
rons by depolarizing them through OX2R (16). We examined
whether YNT-185 excites histaminergic neurons by using whole-
cell patch-clamp recordings in mouse brain slices. Histaminergic
neurons in the TMN were identified by double staining for patch
pipette-injected neurobiotin and histidine decarboxylase (HDC)
after patch-clamp experiments (Fig. 1H). We first investigated the
change of firing rate by adding YNT-185 in the absence of te-
trodotoxin (TTX). Histaminergic neurons in the TMN showed no
spontaneous firing under our recording conditions (Materials and
Methods), but started firing after adding YNT-185 (10 μM) or
orexin A (0.1 μM) (Fig. 1E). YNT-185–induced firing was
inhibited by an OX2R antagonist, EMPA (100 μM) (Fig. 1E),
suggesting that YNT-185 works as an OX2R agonist in these
neurons, sharing the binding site with the endogenous ligand.
Next, we investigated the change of resting membrane potential
by adding YNT-185 in the presence of TTX (1 μM). Under
these conditions, YNT-185 depolarized histaminergic neurons
in the TMN in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 F and G).
These results show that YNT-185 mimics the effects of orexin
on histaminergic neurons in the TMN (16).
YNT-185 Increases Wakefulness in Mice. To evaluate the pharmaco-
logical effect of YNT-185 in vivo, we administered a water-soluble
form of YNT-185 (YNT-185•2HCl) intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.)
in the light period (Zeitgeber time, ZT6), in which mice are mostly
asleep, and monitored the sleep/wake states for 3 h by recording
EEG/EMG in wild-type C57BL/6J mice (Fig. 2A). Because i.c.v.-
administered orexin-A in the light period effectively increased the
wake time at a dose of 3 nmol (14) and the effective dose of YNT-
185 in vitro is ∼100-fold greater that of orexin-A (19), we used 30–
300 nmol YNT-185 for i.c.v. administration. Fig. 2B shows hypno-
grams for 3 h after injection of vehicle or 300 nmol YNT-185. I.c.v.
administration of YNT-185 significantly increased wake time for 3 h

 after administration in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied
by a decrease in NREM sleep time (Fig. 2C and Fig. S1A), in
wild-type mice but not in OXRDKO mice (Fig. 2C and Fig.
S1C). No changes in the amount of REM sleep for 3 h after
administration (Fig. S1 B and D) or rebound sleep in the re-
maining light period and the subsequent dark period (Fig. S1 E–
H) were observed after YNT-185 administration in the light
period. Power spectral analysis of EEG in NREM and REM
sleep showed that EEG power density distributions in the light
period before (Fig. S2 A and D) and after (Fig. S2 B and E)
injection of YNT-185 were comparable. In addition, no change
in EEG power density distribution in NREM and REM sleep
were observed in the subsequent dark period (Fig. S2 C and F),
following YNT-185 administration in the light period.
After i.p. administration of YNT-185 at 40 mg/kg body weight
in the light period, wake time was also significantly increased
(Fig. 2 D and E), accompanied by decreases in both NREM sleep
(Fig. S3A) and REM sleep amounts (Fig. S3B) in wild-type mice
but not in OXRDKO mice (Fig. 2E and Fig. S3 C and D). As
with i.c.v. administration, after i.p. administration of YNT-185
(40 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg) to wild-type mice in the light period, no
noticeable rebounds of sleep in the light period and the sub-
sequent dark period were observed (Fig. S3 E–H). NREM and
REM EEG power densities in the light period before (Fig. S4 A
and D) and after (Fig. S4 B and E) i.p. injection of YNT-185
(40 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg) were unchanged. In the subsequent dark
period, EEG power densities were not altered either (Fig. S4 C
and F). Increase in wake time was also observed in OXKO mice
after YNT-185 administration in the light period (Fig. 2F), with
no rebound of sleep in the light period and the subsequent dark
period (Fig. S5). I.p.-administered YNT-185 has no effect on
body temperature or heart rate (Fig. S6).

Orally (po) administered YNT-185 (100 mg per body) also in-

suggesting that this compound is orally effective, although a high
dose is required.
YNT-185 Ameliorates Narcolepsy Symptoms in Mouse Models. Nar-
coleptic humans and animals suffer from two major symptoms,
i.e., sleepiness and cataplexy in the active phase, and these
symptoms in mouse models are manifested as sleep/wake frag-
mentation and SOREMs (defined here as direct transition from
wakefulness to REM sleep, equivalent to “cataplexy-like state”
in ref. 21), respectively. We examined the effects of YNT-185 on
these symptoms in OXKO mice after administration at the onset
of the dark (active) period (Fig. 3A). Because the frequency of
cataplexy-like episode increases when mice are fed with a par-
ticular kind of chocolate (22), we examined the effect under its
presence. I.c.v.-administered YNT-185 (100, 300 nmol) signifi-
cantly decreased the number of the chocolate-induced SOREM
within 3 h in OXKO mice, but not in OXRDKO mice (Fig. 3 B–
D). Moreover, 300 nmol YNT-185 significantly increased the
latency from injection to the first SOREM in OXKO mice but
not in OXRDKO mice (Fig. 3E).
We also performed i.p. administration of YNT-185 at the
onset of the dark period to narcoleptic mice and counted the

 number of SOREMs (Fig. 3A). I.p.-administered YNT-185 at
40 and 60 mg/kg significantly decreased the number of SOREM
within 3 h compared with vehicle in OXKO mice, but not in
OXRDKO mice (Fig. 3 F–H). Administration of YNT-185 at
40 and 60 mg/kg significantly increased the latency from injection to
the first SOREM in OXKO mice, but not in OXRDKO mice (Fig.
3I). These results suggest that peripherally administered YNT-
185 goes through the blood–brain barrier and acts on OX2R in the
brain to inhibit cataplexy. We also used another narcoleptic model,
orexin/ataxin-3 mice, in which orexin-producing neurons are ge-
netically and postnatally ablated (12). I.p.-administered YNT-185 at
40 mg/kg significantly decreased the frequency of the chocolate-
induced SOREMs in orexin/ataxin-3 mice for 3 h (Fig. 3J). We
then investigated whether the effect of YNT-185 on SOREM are
maintained after repeated administration every 24 h in OXKO
mice. We did not observe a decrease in the effect on SOREMs by
repeated administration of YNT-185 for 7 consecutive days (Fig.
4A). Further, we demonstrated that there was no appreciable de-
sensitization to YNT-185 in terms of SOREM suppression in
OXKO mice, when the compound was i.p. administered every 3 h
during the dark period for 3 consecutive nights (Fig. 4B).
YNT-185 did not induce any alterations in the architecture of
wakefulness for 9 h after i.c.v. or i.p. administration compared
with vehicle administration in OXKO mice (Fig. S7 A and D).
Although YNT-185 suppressed chocolate-induced SOREMs,
sleep/wakefulness fragmentation was not significantly amelio-
rated by this compound. The increased transition frequency be-
tween NREM and wakefulness states was not changed after
YNT-185 administration, whereas i.c.v.-administered orexin-A at
3 nmol tended to improve the fragmentation in OXKO mice
(Fig. S7C). YNT-185 (i.p.) did not affect the number of transi-
tions between each state in OXKO mice either (Fig. S7F). YNT-
185 (i.c.v., i.p.) did not change the mean episode duration of
SOREMs in OXKO mice (Fig. S7 B and E).
In a previous report (17), the targeted restoration of OX2R
expression in dorsal raphe, and of OX1R in the locus coeruleus,
in mice lacking orexin receptors inhibited cataplexy-like episodes
and pathological fragmentation of wakefulness, respectively,

 suggesting a role for OX1R in the consolidation of wakefulness.
Considering these results, additional activation of OX1R may be
necessary for full recovery of pathological fragmentation of
wakefulness in narcoleptic mice. OX2R-null mice and OXKO
mice are similarly affected with behaviorally abnormal attacks of
NREM sleep (“sleep attacks”) and show similar degrees of
fragmentation (18). Focal restoration of OX2R in neurons of the
posterior hypothalamus, including the TMN, rescued the frag-
mentation of wakefulness in OX2R-null mice in the presence of
OX1R (16), further suggesting that simultaneous activation of
both OX1R and OX2R might be important for restoring the
fragmentation of wakefulness.
Most likely, the efficacy of YNT-185 was not strong enough to
rescue the sleep/wake fragmentation in narcoleptic mice, given
that low levels of orexin activity could inhibit cataplexy, whereas
substantially higher levels of orexin activity is necessary for sleep/
wake stabilization (13). A previous study showed that fragmen-
tation of sleep/wakefulness was already observed after ∼86% of
orexin neurons had been ablated, whereas a loss of 95% orexin
neuron was necessary to trigger cataplexy (13), suggesting that a
lower orexinergic activity can inhibit cataplexy than that required
for rescue of the sleep/wake fragmentation.
Notably, YNT-185 (administered by i.c.v. or peripherally)
promotes wakefulness in both wild-type and narcoleptic mice
with no immediate rebound increase of sleep, suggesting that
OX2R agonists might also be useful in the treatment of excessive
daytime sleepiness due to other conditions, such as idiopathic
hypersomnia, sleepiness accompanying depression, sleepiness
due to side effects of various medicines, and jet-lag/shift work.
Metabolic Effects. People with narcolepsy are prone to gaining
weight (11). Rodent models of narcolepsy also tend to develop
late onset obesity (23, 24). We examined whether administration
of YNT-185 could affect the body weight in aged (24 wk old)
OXKO mice, which are heavier than wild-type mice (37.4 ±
0.22 g vs. 34.3 ± 0.5 g, P = 0.01, each n = 3). Before adminis-
tration, there was no difference in body weight between vehicle-
and YNT-185–administered groups (Fig. 4C, Left). However, we
found that the body weight of aged OXKO mice was significantly
lower in the group with daily i.p. administration of YNT-185
(40 mg/kg) at the start of dark period for 14 successive days
compared with vehicle-treated group (Fig. 4C, Center). No effect
of YNT-185 was seen in OXRDKO mice (data not shown).
These results are consistent with the previous report that pep-
tidic OX2R-selective agonist inhibits diet-induced obesity (24).
After administration of YNT-185 was terminated, the body
weight gradually recovered in aged OXKO mice (Fig. 4C, Right),
suggesting that the effect of YNT-185 on the body weight is
reversible. Orexin plays a key role in the regulation of muscle
glucose metabolism by activating muscle sympathetic nerves
(25). Moreover, the amplitude of metabolic circadian rhythm is
crucial for preventing hepatic insulin resistance, and sleep dis-
turbances are associated with type 2 diabetes (26). Indeed, daily
active-phase administrations of orexin-A prevented hepatic in-
sulin resistance via bidirectional regulation of the autonomic
nervous system (26), whereas daily resting-phase administrations
of suvorexant for 2–4 wk improved glucose tolerance in obese
mice (27). Taken together, in narcoleptic patients, daytime ad-
ministration of OX2R agonist may have beneficial effects not
only on promoting daytime wakefulness, but also on ameliorating
metabolic abnormalities.
Because of its limited in vivo efficacy, we do not consider YNT-
185 suitable for further clinical development. We are now further
improving YNT-185 in terms of potency and CNS bioavailability.
Nevertheless, the present study demonstrates the utility of orexin-
deficient and orexin receptor-deficient mouse models to assess
pharmacological and mechanistic approaches for the treatment of
narcolepsy. There have been several investigations published in
this regard (11, 28, 29), but our study is distinct in treating the core
defect in narcolepsy as opposed to other studies that assess drug
effects on narcolepsy symptomatology.

 in our university and Fundamental Guideline for Proper Conduct of Animal Ex-
periments and Related Activities in Academic Research Institutions under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology
(MEXT). Increase of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured by using
CHO-K1 cells stably expressing human OX1R (CHO/hOX1R) or OX2R (CHO/
hOX2R). Patch-clamp recordings were performed in histaminergic neurons of
coronal slices (200 μm) from 3- to 5-wk-old male mice. EEG/EMG implantation
was performed as described elsewhere with slight modification (30).
