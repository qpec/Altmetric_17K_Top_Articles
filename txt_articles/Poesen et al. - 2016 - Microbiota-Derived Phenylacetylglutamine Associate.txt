ABSTRACT
Colonic microbial metabolism substantially contributes to uremic solute production. p-Cresyl sulfate and
indoxyl sulfate are the main representatives of solutes of microbial origin and also, protein-bound solutes,
exhibiting high protein-binding affinity and dependence on tubular secretion. Phenylacetylglutamine is
another microbial metabolite with high dependence on tubular secretion but low protein-binding affinity.
The relevance of such solutes is unknown. Therefore, we prospectively followed 488 patients with CKD stages
1–5 and a measurement of serum phenylacetylglutamine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In a
subgroup, we determined 24-hour urinary excretion as a surrogate of intestinal uptake as well as renal clearance
of phenylacetylglutamine. We performed outcome analysis for mortality (51 events) and cardiovascular disease
(75 events). Serum phenylacetylglutamine level correlated with 24-hour urinary excretion (rho=0.55; P,0.001)
and clearance of phenylacetylglutamine (rho=20.76; P,0.001). Phenylacetylglutamine clearance also corre-
lated with eGFR (rho=0.84; P,0.001). Furthermore, serum phenylacetylglutamine level associated with mor-
tality (hazard ratio per 1-SD increase, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.22 to 2.57; P=0.003) and cardiovascular
disease (hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.32 to 2.41; P,0.001) after adjustment for age, sex,
presence of diabetes mellitus, prior cardiovascular disease, and eGFR. Thus, serum phenylacetylglutamine
level is elevated in patients with more advanced CKD and determined by intestinal uptake and renal clearance,
and it is not fully accounted for by differences in eGFR. High serum phenylacetylglutamine level is a strong and
independent risk factor for mortality and cardiovascular disease, suggesting the relevance of microbial me-
tabolism and/or tubular dysfunction in CKD, irrespective of protein binding.

to the syndrome of uremia.1,2 Vice versa, CKD along
with renal dietary restrictions also have a substantial
influence on microbial function.3 The most widely
studied uremic retention solutes originating from co-
lonic microbial metabolism are p-cresyl sulfate and
indoxyl sulfate. p-Cresyl sulfate results from the com-
bined actions of microbial fermentation of the amino
acid tyrosine to p-cresol and endogenous sulfate con-
jugation. Likewise, indoxyl sulfate is the end product
of microbial fermentation of the amino acid trypto-
phan to indole followed byendogenous oxidation and
sulfate conjugation.2 Both p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl
sulfate have been repeatedly associated with mortality
and cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD as
supported by mechanistic studies.4–12

 Phenylacetylglutamine (PAG) is another recently identified
colonic microbial metabolite from amino acid fermentation. It
resultsfromglutamineconjugationofphenylaceticacid,whichis
almost exclusively derived from the microbial conversion of
phenylalanine.1,13 Other than their microbial origin, p-cresyl
sulfate, indoxyl sulfate, and PAG have in common that active
tubular secretion and not glomerular filtration is the predomi-
nant pathway for their renal clearance.14–16 Renal clearance of
PAG is highly efficient, approaching renal plasma flow in healthy
individuals.16 As hypothesized by Sirich et al.,16 the potential
toxic nature of these solutes in patients with CKD may be de-
rived from their dependence on high tubular secretion, because
evolution has provided the native kidney with the ability of
highly efficient removal of toxic solutes.16 Currently, RRT can-
not substitute for tubular function, making these solutes partic-
ularly prone to accumulation in patients on hemodialysis as
illustrated by predialysis serum levels of PAG that are .100-
fold higher than those of healthy volunteers.17
Although p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate are consid-
ered representatives of the group of protein-bound solutes
caused by high protein binding,18 PAG is much less protein
bound, with a bound fraction of approximately 20%.16,19 In
general, it is often stated that protein binding limits solute
removal by the native kidney as well as RRT, thus promoting
accumulation and possibly, toxicity.20 However, it can be as-
sumed that only the free fraction of these solutes is biologically
active and potentially harmful to the human body. Actually, as
shown in the work by Sirich et al.,16 when considering free
solute levels, protein binding enhances clearance by
providing a readily accessible reservoir for efficient removal
of the solute throughout its passage within the native kidney or
dialyzer.16,17 Also, as the unbound solute fraction increases
along with renal function decline, accumulation of the free
solute fraction is even more pronounced, whereas increases
in total solute concentrations are rather attenuated.17,20
To date, the bad reputation of p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl
sulfate has been mainly attributed to their protein binding
characteristics,18 whereas the contribution of both tubular
function and microbial metabolism may have been neglected.
To test this hypothesis, we aimed to explore the relationship
between serum PAG and adverse outcomes in patients with
CKD not yet on dialysis. Furthermore, we investigated the
differential contribution of renal function and intestinal up-
take to serum levels of PAG in different stages of CKD.
RESULTS
Inclusion and Baseline Characteristics
Between November of 2005 and September of 2006, 499
prevalent patients with CKD Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality
Initiative stages 1–5 were included in the Leuven Mild-to-
Moderate CKD Study. Measurements of serum PAG were avail-
able in a total of 488 patients (Supplemental Figure 1). Baseline
characteristics of the study population according to tertiles of
serum PAG are presented in Table 1. Glomerular disease was the
most prevalent underlying renal disease (32.0%) followed by
vascular disease (20.3%), congenital disease (including autoso-
mal dominant polycystic disease; 13.9%), diabetic nephropathy
(7.6%), and tubulointerstitial disease (7.0%).
Determinants of Serum PAG
Serum PAG amounted to a median of 6.21 mM (interquartile
range [IQR], 2.99–13.18). There was a strong inverse correlation
between serum PAG and eGFR (Spearman rank correlation rho
=20.76; P,0.001). Other correlations between baseline charac-
teristics and serum PAG are presented in Supplemental Table 1.
In multivariate regression analysis, independent determinants of
serum PAG were age (b=0.008; standardized b=0.12; P,0.001),
body mass index (b=20.01; standardized b=20.06; P=0.04),
hemoglobin (b=20.05; standardized b=20.08; P=0.03), albu-
min (b=20.02; standardized b=20.07; P=0.02), and eGFR
(b=21.26; standardized b=20.66; P,0.001; model R2 =0.59)
(Supplemental Table 2).
We also sampled 24-hour urinary collections in a subgroup of
200 patients to calculate renal clearance and 24-hour urinary
excretion of PAG. Apart from a small, although significant
difference in age (median =60 years old; IQR, 48–72 in the sub-
group versus median =64 years old;IQR, 50–74 in the full cohort;
P=0.02), there were no differences in baseline characteristics, in-
cluding serum PAG, between the subgroup and the full cohort
(data not shown). Renal clearance of PAG amounted to a median
of 119 ml/min (IQR, 66–235), which was approximately 3.3-fold
(IQR, 2.48–4.78) higher than eGFR. Although clearance of PAG
was strongly correlated with eGFR (rho=0.84; P,0.001) (Figure
1B), correlation between serum PAG and clearance of PAG
(rho=20.76; P,0.001) was nominally higher than correlation
between serum PAG and eGFR (rho=20.73; P,0.001) (Figure 1,
A and C) (Supplemental Figure 2). Correlation with serum PAG
was also slightly lower when considering measured creatinine
clearance instead of eGFR (rho=20.69; P,0.001). Furthermore,
we observed a significant and direct correlation between eGFR
and fractional excretion of PAG (rho=0.45; P,0.001) (Figure
1D). When focusing on patients with eGFR,30 ml/min per
1.73 m2, we observed a moderate correlation between serum
PAG and renal clearance of PAG (rho=20.59; P,0.001) that
was, again, nominally higher than the correlations between se-
rum PAG and eGFR (rho=20.48; P,0.001) and between serum
PAG and measured creatinine clearance (rho=20.43; P,0.001).
In addition, we noted a significant correlation between
serum PAG and 24-hour urinary excretion of PAG (rho=0.55;
P,0.001), whereas there was no correlation between 24-hour
urinary excretion of PAG and eGFR (rho=20.09; P=0.22)
(Figure 1, E and F). In linear regression, adding 24-hour uri-
nary excretion of PAG to eGFR substantially improved model
fit for serum PAG (R2=0.82) (Table 2).
Furthermore, we calculated 24-hour protein intake and
studied its relationship with serum PAG and 24-hour urinary
excretionofPAG.Althoughtherewasnosignificantcorrelation
between 24-hour protein intake and serum PAG (rho=20.07;

 P=0.32), we noted a significant correlation between 24-hour pro-
tein intake and 24-hour urinary excretion of PAG (rho=0.35;
P,0.001). In multivariate regression analysis, including demo-
graphic and biochemical parameters, 24-hour protein intake was
also significantly associated with serum PAG (b=0.96; standard-
ized b=0.24; P,0.001).
Serum PAG and Overall Mortality
During follow-up, we observed a total of 51 deaths (Supple-
mental Table 3), with significantly more deaths among pa-
tients with serum PAG in higher tertiles (tertiles 1–3: 6, 20,
and 25 events, respectively; log rank P,0.001) (Figure 2). In
univariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, serum PAG was
also significantly associated with overall mortality (hazard ra-
tio [HR] per 1-SD increase, 2.17; 95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 1.57 to 2.99; P,0.001) (Table 3). This association
remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, presence of
diabetes mellitus, prior cardiovascular disease, and eGFR
(full-model HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.57; P=0.003).
For comparison, we also explored the relationship between
overall mortality and serum levels of free p-cresyl sulfate. As
can be derived from Table 4, serum free p-cresyl sulfate was
significantly associated with overall mortality in univariate
analysis, whereas there was no independent association after
adjustment for the same covariates.
Serum PAG and Cardiovascular Disease
Next, we explored the relationship between serum PAG and
cardiovasculardisease,observing75cardiovasculareventsduring
follow-up (Supplemental Table 4). The number of events was
significantlyhigher among patients with PAG inhigher tertiles of
serum PAG (tertiles 1–3: 10, 28, and 37 events, respectively; log
rank P,0.001) (Figure 3). Serum PAG was also significantly
associated with cardiovascular disease in univariate Cox propor-
tional hazard analysis (HR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.70 to 2.87; P,0.001)
(Table 5). In addition, the relationship between serum PAG and
cardiovascular events during follow-up remained significant af-
ter adjustment for age, sex, presence of diabetes mellitus, prior
cardiovascular disease, and eGFR (full-model HR, 1.79; 95% CI,
1.32 to 2.41; P,0.001).
As can be derived from Table 4, associations between car-
diovascular events and serum solute levels were comparable
for PAG and free p-cresyl sulfate.
DISCUSSION

identified uremic retention solute originating from microbial
metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine in patients with
mild to moderate CKD. The key findings are as follows: (1)

 and indoxyl sulfate as the main representatives of this group of
solutes.1,2 Both solutes have been repeatedly associated to ad-
verse outcomes in patients with renal dysfunction.4–8,21 This
has been mainly attributed to their protein binding character-
istics,18 especially in patients on RRT and when potentially
wrongfully, focusing on removal of total serum levels.22 In pa-
tients not yet on dialysis, these protein-bound solutes depend on
highly efficient tubular secretion for their renal clearance.14–16 It
remains unknown whether other solutes with a colonic micro-
bial origin and substantial tubular secretion but without high
protein binding may also be of relevance in patients with CKD.
Therefore,we measured serumlevels ofPAG in488 patients with
CKD not yet on dialysis and studied theirdeterminants as well as
their relationship with adverse outcomes.
SerumlevelsofPAGwereassociatedwithage,bodymassindex,
hemoglobin, albumin, and renal function (model R2 =0.59). In
the subgroup of patients with availability of 24-hour urinary
collection, higher daily protein intake was another factor related
to higher serum levels of PAG. Diminished renal function mea-
sured by eGFR (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology
Collaboration [CKD-EPI]) was the strongest determinant of
higher levels of serum PAG, although considerable interindivid-
ual variability could still be observed. In a subgroup of patients
with 24-hour urinary collection, we also measured renal clear-
ance of PAG. Median renal PAG clearance was approximately
3.3-fold higher than eGFR, pointing to highly efficient tubular
secretion and confirming previous findings in healthy volun-
teers.16 From this, it can be estimated that tubular secretory re-
moval of PAG outweighs removal by glomerular filtration by
more than twofold. Overall, renal clearance of PAG also declined
slightly more than eGFR, suggesting saturation of tubular trans-
porters at higher stages of CKD. Although in general, clearance of
PAG was strongly correlated with eGFR, correlation between se-
rum PAG and clearance of PAG was nominally higher than cor-
relation between serum PAG and eGFR. Thus, although eGFR
can be considered a reasonable estimate of renal clearance of
PAG, disagreement between eGFR and renal PAG clearance
may contribute to the observed variability of individual serum
levels of PAG that is still present after adjusting for eGFR. Addi-
tional research will be necessary to explore tubular transporter
mechanisms that are involved in renal clearance of PAG. We also
measured 24-hour urinary excretion of PAG, which assuming
negligible nonrenal clearance of PAG, functions as an indirect
estimate of 24-hour intestinal uptake. We observed substantial
interindividual variability of intestinal uptake of PAG, albeit
without a clear influence of renal function, thus also contributing
to the wide dispersion of individual serum levels of PAG as al-
ready shown for p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate.23
In patients with mild to moderate CKD, serum PAG was
strongly relatedtooverallmortalityand cardiovasculardisease,
even when adjusted for age, sex, presence of diabetes mellitus,

 prior cardiovascular disease, and eGFR. This finding confirms
andextendsapreviousobservationinpatientsonhemodialysis
showing a relationship between serum PAG and cardiovascular
disease.24 In addition, the association between serum solute
levels and adverse outcomes was as least as strong for PAG as
for free p-cresyl sulfate, highlighting the relevance of solutes
with a microbial origin and highly efficient tubular secretion,
irrespective of protein binding. Whether PAG itself is a true
uremic toxin remains unknown. Although findings in healthy
volunteers have suggested that high serum levels of PAG are
relatively well tolerated, at least over the short term,25 the
effects of ongoing exposure to this solute in patients with
CKD need additional exploration, including mechanistic
studies. Furthermore, because higher serum levels of PAG
result from an imbalance between intesti-
nal exposure and renal tubular secretion,
serum PAG may merely be a marker for a
deleterious colonic microbial metabolism
and/or tubular secretory dysfunction. Re-
garding tubular function, an independent
association between higher mortality and
diminished renal clearance of hippurate,
another solute with high tubular secretion,
albeit with a protein-bound fraction of
.50%, has recently been shown.26 Al-
though these observations need confirma-
tion in other larger patient populations, they suggest that a
better understanding of renal tubular function is necessary not
only to identify solutes that are prone to accumulation and
thus, potentially harmful but also, in an attempt to improve
current risk stratification of patients with CKD on the basis of
eGFR and proteinuria.
There are limitations to our study. First, the study design
precludes causal inferences. Second, our study population
mainly consisted of white patients. Care must be taken when
extrapolating our data to other patient populations. Third,
assessment of completeness of urinary collections was arbi-
trary. We assumed completeness of urinary collections when
urinary excretion of creatinine was within 2 SDs of the mean
creatinine excretion for the geographic region of this study

 (the INTERSALT Study).27 Fourth, we cannot formally ex-
clude solute production within the kidney, thus potentially
overestimating renal clearance. Fifth, because we do not have
simultaneous measurements of serum phenylacetic acid, we
cannot differentiate between potential effects of concomitant
higher serum levels of phenylacetic acid and increased phase
2 metabolism to PAG. Sixth, our analyses are on the basis of
single baseline biochemical measurements that are potentially
subjected to variability over time. Of note, substantial variabil-
ity over time would only increase the likelihood to not show a
significant association between PAG and adverse outcomes.
In conclusion, high serum levels of PAG are observed in
patients with more advanced CKD and a strong and in-
dependent risk factor for overall mortality and cardiovascular
disease. Additional research is necessary to elucidate whether
PAG contributes directly to uremic toxicity or reflects the
presence of a deleterious colonic microbial metabolism and/or
tubular dysfunction.
CONCISE METHODS
Study Population
This was an ancillary analysis of the Leuven Mild-to-Moderate CKD
Study, a prospective cohort to investigate the role of uremic retention
solutes in patients with CKD not yet on dialysis (Clinicaltrials.gov
identifier: NCT00441623).7 Prevalent patients with CKD followed at
the nephrology outpatient clinic of the University Hospitals Leuven
who were $18 years of age and able to provide consent were eligible
for inclusion. Mild to moderate CKD was defined as presence of
kidney damage (i.e., pathologic abnormalities or abnormalities in
urine or imaging tests) or eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for $3
months, with exclusion of patients on RRTor with a history of renal
transplantation. Patients were screened between November of 2005 and
September of 2006. The study was performed according to the Decla-
ration of Helsinki and approved by the ethics committee of the Univer-
sity Hospitals Leuven. Informed consent was obtained from all patients.
Biochemical Measurements
At inclusion, blood was taken by venous puncture for measurement
of hemoglobin (grams per deciliter), albumin (grams per liter),
C-reactive protein (milligrams per liter), cholesterol (milligrams per
deciliter), calcium (milligrams per deciliter), phosphate (milligrams
per deciliter), biointact parathyroid hormone (nanograms per liter),
and creatinine (milligrams per deciliter), all measured using standard
laboratory techniques. The eGFR was calculated using the CKD-
EPI equation.28 We also had ancillary data available on free serum
levels of p-cresyl sulfate determined as p-cresol with a dedicated gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry method, allowing comparison
with a protein-bound solute.7,29 Additionally, serum levels of PAG
were quantified by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry (Acquity–Xevo TQS; Waters, Milford, MA). For
sample preparation, 50 ml serum or urine, 50 ml solution of milli-Q
(MQ) water:MeOH:0.01 N sodium hydroxide (75:20:5 vol/vol/vol),
20 ml internal standard mixture (PAG-d5), and 150 ml acetonitrile
were thoroughly mixed in 96-well Ostro Plates (Waters). After sep-
aration by a positive pressure manifold, supernatants were collected
in 2-ml collection plates. Subsequently, the organic phase was re-
moved by a gentle stream of nitrogen for 30 minutes at 40°C. After
dilution with 1000 ml MQ water, 5 ml final solution was injected on
the ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spec-
trometry system. Chromatographic separation was performed on
an Acquity CSHFluoroPhenyl Column (5032.5 mm; 1.7-mm particle
size; Waters). The mobile phase, delivered at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min
at 40°C, consisted of a gradient of 0.1% formic acid in MQ water (A)
and MeOH (B). The gradient was as follows: starting with 3% B, there
was a subsequent increase to 16% B within 1 minute followed by an
increase to 80% B within 3 minutes and thereafter, an increase to 95%
B within 30 seconds for a duration of 1 minute, after which the initial
3% B was reintroduced with equilibration for a duration of 3.5 min-
utes before the next injection. Ionization of PAG and the correspond-
ing isotopologue (internal standard) was achieved in negative mode.
The following multiple reaction monitoring transitions were used for
quantification: PAG 263→145 and PAG-d5 268→145. Limit of de-
tection and limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.06 and 0.18 mM for
PAG. For analysis, solute levels below the LOQ were treated as the
average value of the limit of detection and the LOQ. The total, within–
run, between–run, and between–day method imprecisions according
to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards EP5-T
guideline were 3.92%, 1.61%, 2.69%, and 2.02%, respectively, and
the mean recovery was 97%. We also sampled 24-hour urinary col-
lections when available at the time of inclusion to calculate renal
clearance and 24-hour urinary excretion of PAG. Collections were
considered complete when 24-hour urinary creatinine excretion was
within 2 SDs (range =0.7–1.8 g) of the mean creatinine excretion for
the geographic region of this study derived from the INTERSALT
Study.27 Assuming steady-state conditions and negligible nonrenal
clearance, 24-hour urinary excretion of PAG was considered an indirect
estimate of 24-hour intestinal uptake of PAG. Furthermore, protein
intake was calculated30 according to the formula by Maroni et al.31 using
24-hour urinary urea nitrogen excretion and body weight.
End Point Evaluation
After inclusion, patients were prospectively followed at the nephrol-
ogy outpatient clinic at 3- to 6-month intervals until December 31,
2010. End point evaluation has been described previously7 and con-
sisted of overall mortality and first cardiovascular event. Cause of
death was classified as cardiovascular, infectious, malignancy, or
other. First cardiovascular event was a composite of death from
Table 5.

Statistical Analyses
Data are expressed as means (SDs) for normally distributed variables
or medians (IQRs) for non–normally distributed variables. Differ-
ences between baseline variables according to tertiles of serum PAG
were tested using parametric ANOVA, Kruskal–Wallis test, or chi-
squared test as appropriate. Correlations between serum PAG and
other variables were calculated by Spearman rank correlation co-
efficients. To identify independent determinants of serum PAG,
multivariate linear regression analysis was performed. Relevant de-
mographic (i.e., age, sex, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, and body
mass index) and biochemical (i.e., hemoglobin, C-reactive protein,
albumin, and eGFR) parameters were first subjected to a backward
elimination procedure at P,0.20 and subsequently, a final backward
elimination step at P,0.05. Standardized b-coefficients were ob-
tained after prior conversion of each variable to a Z score. In a sub-
group of patients with 24-hour urinary collection, correlation and
linear regression analyses were also performed with serum PAG,
24-hour urinary excretion of PAG, renal clearance of PAG, and
eGFR. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate cumulative in-
cidence of the end point with the log rank test to compare differences
between tertiles of serum PAG. Time to first event analysis was per-
formed using Cox proportional hazards analysis with adjustment for
age, sex, presence of diabetes mellitus, prior cardiovascular disease, and
eGFR. For overall mortality, data were censored at the start of RRT (i.e.,
hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or preemptive renal transplantation),
loss to follow-up, or the end of the study observation period. With
respect to cardiovascular disease, additional censoring was performed
for noncardiovascular death. For all statistical analyses, P values ,0.05
were consideredsignificant. All statisticalanalyseswere performedusing
SAS (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
