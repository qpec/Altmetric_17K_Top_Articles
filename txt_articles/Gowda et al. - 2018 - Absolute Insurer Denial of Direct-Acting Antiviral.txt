Background. Despite the availability of new direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens, changes in DAA reimbursement criteria, 
and a public health focus on hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination, it remains unclear if public and private insurers have increased 
access to these therapies over time. We evaluated changes in the incidence of absolute denial of DAA therapy over time and by 
insurance type.
Methods. We conducted a prospective cohort study among patients who had a DAA prescription submitted from January 2016 
to April 2017 to Diplomat Pharmacy, Inc., which provides HCV pharmacy services across the United States. The main outcome was 
absolute denial of DAA prescription, defined as lack of fill approval by the insurer. We calculated the incidence of absolute denial, 
overall and by insurance type (Medicaid, Medicare, commercial), for the 16-month study period and each quarter.
Results. Among 9025 patients from 45 states prescribed a DAA regimen (4702 covered by Medicaid, 1821 Medicare, 2502 
commercial insurance), 3200 (35.5%; 95% confidence interval, 34.5%–36.5%) were absolutely denied treatment. Absolute denial 
was more common among patients covered by commercial insurance (52.4%) than Medicaid (34.5%, P < .001) or Medicare (14.7%, 
P < .001). The incidence of absolute denial increased across each quarter of the study period, overall (27.7% in first quarter to 43.8% 
in last quarter; test for trend, P < .001) and for each insurance type (test for trend, P < .001 for each type).
Conclusions. Despite the availability of new DAA regimens and changes in restrictions of these therapies, absolute denials of 
DAA regimens by insurers have remained high and increased over time, regardless of insurance type.

INTRODUCTION
All-oral, direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens for the treat-
ment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have been 
available since 2014 [1]. These regimens result in high (≥94%) 
rates of cure and have been associated with few adverse effects 
[2]. Viral eradication can help to eliminate HCV transmission 
[3, 4], reduce the risk of liver complications [5], decrease extra-
hepatic manifestations of disease [6], and prolong survival [7]. 
As a result, HCV management guidelines from the American 
Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/Infectious Diseases 
Society of America have recommended DAA treatment for all 
chronic HCV-infected patients [8]. The ability to cure chronic 
HCV in nearly all infected people makes the prospect of elimi-
nating HCV in the United States possible [9].
Despite the acknowledged benefits of HCV therapy [10], 
the high costs of DAAs have led public and private insurers in 
the United States to restrict access to these medications [11]. 
Insurers established varying criteria for reimbursement of 
DAAs, such as evidence of advanced liver fibrosis, consultation 
with a specialist, and/or abstinence from alcohol or illicit drug 
use [12, 13]. Restrictions for reimbursement of DAAs have been 
shown to be common across state Medicaid programs [14–16]. 
Analyses conducted shortly after the release of DAAs into the 
market showed that the downstream effect of these restrictions, 
absolute denial by insurers, was common overall, but more fre-
quent among patients covered by Medicaid than Medicare or 
commercial insurance [17, 18]. However, these studies were not 
nationally representative and evaluated access to DAAs during 
their initial availability only.
Over the last 2 years, advocacy efforts by stakeholders, class 
action lawsuits, threats of legal action, and greater price compe-
tition due to the availability of new DAAs have led to relaxations

of restrictions in DAA reimbursement within a variety of set-
tings [19–21]. Consequently, it is important to examine how 
access to DAAs has changed since their initial release.
We determined the incidence of absolute denial of DAA ther-
apy by type of insurance in a national sample of chronic HCV-
infected patients prescribed DAA therapy between January 
2016 and April 2017. Given the relaxation of restrictions in 
DAA reimbursements across a number of settings, we hypoth-
esized that the overall incidence of absolute denial was lower 
than in initial reports [17, 18] and has declined over time.
METHODS
Study Design and Data Source
We conducted a prospective cohort study using data from 
Diplomat Pharmacy, Inc., which provides specialty pharma-
ceuticals, including DAAs, to patients across the United States. 
DAAs are often dispensed by specialty pharmacies because of 
their high costs and requirements for special handling and deliv-
ery [22]. For each DAA prescription, Diplomat contacts the pre-
scribing clinician, obtains information required by the insurer 
to determine medical need for DAA treatment, and submits this 
to the insurer for review. Final decision on DAA fill (approval or 
denial) is provided to the pharmacy from the insurer, typically 
within 30 days. Diplomat uses an electronic record system to 
record data on demographics, health insurance, and prescribed 
medications. HCV-related clinical data, such as HCV genotype, 
stage of hepatic fibrosis, alcohol consumption, and HIV status, 
are not electronically available for all patients with a submitted 
DAA prescription. The study was approved by the University of 
Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board.
Study Patients
Chronic HCV-infected patients with health insurance were 
included if they had a DAA prescription submitted to Diplomat 
between January 1, 2016, and April 30, 2017. If a patient had 
multiple DAA treatment courses prescribed during the period 
of interest, only the first regimen was included. Follow-up 
began on the date that the DAA prescription was received by 
Diplomat. Observation continued until the pharmacy ascer-
tained the final outcome for the prescription (ie, absolute denial 
or DAA prescription fill).
Main Study Outcome
The primary outcome was absolute denial of DAA prescription, 
defined as lack of approval of DAA fill by the insurer. The sta-
tus of all prescriptions with insurers was ascertained through 
August 31, 2017. Insurers’ requests for alternative DAA regi-
mens due to formulary restrictions were not recorded as abso-
lute denials.
Data Collection
Demographic and pharmacy data collected from Diplomat’s 
electronic records at the time the DAA prescription was 
received by the pharmacy included age, sex, state of residence, 
type of insurance, and DAA regimen prescribed. Type of insur-
ance was determined based on the insurance plan to which the 
DAA prescription was submitted and was classified as Medicaid 
(joint federal- and state-funded programs for medical care and 
drug benefits for low-income and special needs individuals 
[23]), Medicare (federal health insurance program available to 
Americans aged ≥65 years and to some <65 years with certain 
disabilities or chronic health conditions [24]), or commercial 
insurance (health benefits that are employer sponsored, pri-
vately purchased, or obtained via health exchange through the 
Affordable Care Act [25]). For patients covered by Medicaid, 
we also determined enrollment in a fee-for-service or managed 
care plan.
Statistical Analysis
Differences in patients’ characteristics by type of insurance 
(Medicaid, Medicare, or commercial insurance) were assessed 
using chi-square tests for categorical data and Kruskal-Wallis 
tests for continuous data.
We calculated the incidence and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) of absolute denial of DAA prescription, overall and by 
type of insurance, for the total 16-month study period and for 
each quarter. We included April 2017 within the final quarter 
(January–April 2017) for these analyses. We determined tests 
for trend to assess the significance of changes in the incidence 
of absolute DAA denial over time. In addition, we calculated 
the proportion of absolute denials within each state, overall and 
by insurance type. Data were analyzed using Stata 12.1 (Stata 
Corporation, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Between January 1, 2016, and April 30, 2017, Diplomat received 
DAA prescriptions for 9025 patients from 45 US states (4702 
covered by Medicaid; 1821 by Medicare; 2502 by commercial 
insurance). Medicaid patients were younger than those with 
Medicare or commercial insurance (Table 1).
Among these 9025 patients, 3200 (35.5%; 95% CI, 34.5%–
36.5%) received an absolute denial of their treatment (Figure 1; 
Supplementary Table 1). Throughout the observation period, 
the incidence of absolute denial was more common among 
patients covered by commercial insurance (52.4%) than by 
Medicaid (34.5%, P < .001) or Medicare (14.7%, P < .001). 
Among Medicaid beneficiaries, the overall incidence of abso-
lute denial was higher among those with fee-for-service (47.5%) 
than managed care plans (32.6%, P < .001).
The incidence of absolute denial increased across each 
quarter of the 16-month study period when examined overall 
(27.7% in the first quarter to 43.8% in the last quarter; test for 
trend, P < .001) and for each type of insurance (test for trend, 
P < .001 for each type) (Figure 1). Among Medicaid beneficiar-
ies, patients enrolled in managed care plans experienced an 
increase in the incidence of absolute denial over time (test for 
trend, P < .001); however, no change over time was observed for

those enrolled in fee-for-service plans (test for trend, P = .34) 
(Supplementary Table 1).
Among the 45 states from which a DAA prescription was 
submitted during the observation period, 8 states contributed 
90% of prescriptions: Pennsylvania (2839 [31.5%]), California 
(2133 [23.6%]), Michigan (1292 [14.3%]), Massachusetts (557 
[6.2%]), New Jersey (553 [6.1%]), Delaware (316 [3.5%]), 
Oregon (231 [2.6%]), and Maryland (167 [1.9%]) (Table 2). 
The overall incidence of absolute DAA denial varied by type of 
insurance within and across states (Figure 2; Table 2). Among 
prescriptions submitted from these 8 states, the overall inci-
dence of absolute denial was higher in Maryland (86/167 
[51.5%]), Delaware (155/316 [49.1%]), New Jersey (261/553 
[47.2%]), and Pennsylvania (1297/2839 [45.7%]) than those in 
the other 4 states.
DISCUSSION
For DAA prescriptions submitted to a national specialty phar-
macy between January 2016 and April 2017, 35.5% were abso-
lutely denied by the insurance carrier. The incidence of absolute

denial was higher among commercially insured (52.4%) and 
Medicaid (34.5%) beneficiaries compared with Medicare bene-
ficiaries (14.7%). Notably, the incidence of denial increased for 
all insurance types over subsequent quarters during the obser-
vation period. Finally, the incidence of absolute DAA denial 
varied by type of insurance within and across states.
Contrary to our hypothesis, the overall incidence of abso-
lute denial in this study (35.5%) was substantially higher in 
magnitude than that observed in 2 prior analyses conducted 
shortly after the release of all-oral DAA regimens (absolute 
denial range, 8.2%–16.2%) [17, 18]. The reason for this high-
er-than-expected denial rate is unclear, but may be due to 
attempts to treat chronic HCV-infected patients who have less 
advanced liver fibrosis, have not met sobriety restrictions, or 
have not had consultation with a specialist.
In prior studies, denial of DAA therapy was reported to 
occur in as high as 46.3% of Medicaid beneficiaries [17, 18]. 
In contrast, the results of the present study indicate that the 
overall incidence of absolute denial of DAAs is now lower 
in magnitude for Medicaid beneficiaries (34.5%). The lower 
overall absolute denial rate of DAAs among Medicaid benefi-
ciaries is likely a consequence of the statement by the Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services that restriction of access 
to DAAs based on cost containment violates federal law [26], 
following reports highlighting restrictions on reimbursement 
of DAAs across state Medicaid programs [14, 15]. This noti-
fication prompted class action lawsuits and threats of legal 
action against some state Medicaid programs in response to the 
rationing of DAA therapies [27–29]. These efforts contributed 
to changes in the criteria for reimbursement of DAAs across a 
number of Medicaid programs [16]. There have been several 
notable trends in Medicaid HCV treatment criteria in recent 
years, including more transparency in treatment restrictions, 
decreased restrictions particularly for the degree of liver fibro-
sis, and more information on restrictions imposed by man-
aged care organizations [19]. However, as Table 2 and Figure 2 
demonstrate, there remains considerable heterogeneity in the 
incidence of absolute denial across state Medicaid programs, 
presumably due to the varying criteria for reimbursement 
across these programs [14–16].

We found that among Medicaid beneficiaries, the over-
all incidence of absolute denial was higher among those with 
fee-for-service than managed care plans. However, Medicaid 
patients enrolled in managed care plans experienced an increase 
in the incidence of absolute denial over time, while no change 
was observed for those enrolled in fee-for-service plans. The 
increase in denial for Medicaid patients in managed care plans 
is concerning since Medicaid programs, by law, must ensure 
that their managed care organizations offer either similar or 
less restrictive coverage than the fee-for-service plans in the 
same state [30]. Regulators should ensure that parity in access 
to DAA treatments between Medicaid fee-for-service and man-
aged care programs is monitored and enforced.
Our study found a substantially higher incidence of absolute 
denial for patients covered by Medicare (14.7%) and commercial 
insurance (52.4%) than that reported in prior studies [17, 18]. 
 
Those reports showed that 2.5%–5.0% of Medicare beneficiar-
ies and 5.9%–10.2% of commercially insured individuals had 
their DAA regimens absolutely denied. Little is known about 
restrictions to HCV treatment among Medicare and commer-
cial insurance beneficiaries. It is possible that these plans were 
less restrictive shortly after the release of DAAs but became 
more restrictive in their reimbursement policy over time. Our 
data highlight the need for transparency in defining criteria for 
restriction by all insurers, including commercial insurance and 
Medicare Part D plans.
Also contrary to our hypothesis, we observed that the inci-
dence of absolute denial increased over time, regardless of 
insurance type. The reasons for this increase remain unclear. 
The combination of cost and demand for DAA treatments has 
strained the budgets of many payers since these drugs became 
available [12]. As a result, insurers may be electing to prioritize 
certain patient populations, such as those who have advanced 
hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis or who abstain from alcohol and injec-
tion drug use, when deciding whether to allocate DAA treat-
ments [11–13]. Future studies should evaluate the reasons for 
the increasing denials across insurance plans as well as denial 
rates in specific patient groups.
The high incidence of absolute denial of DAA therapy has 
important implications. From a clinical standpoint, patients 
denied access to HCV therapy remain at risk for the develop-
ment of hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver decompensation, and 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Denial of DAA treatment can also 
lead to ongoing HCV-associated inflammation, which might 
increase the risk of extrahepatic complications. Further, failure 
to treat and cure chronic HCV maintains a reservoir of HCV 
transmission. From a public health standpoint, the high inci-
dence of absolute denial of DAA treatment represents a major 
barrier to the goal of HCV elimination. A recent report by the 
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 
determined that at least 260 000 chronic HCV-infected patients 
must be treated yearly to achieve elimination of HCV in the 
United States by 2030 [9]. Given the clinical benefits of curing 
chronic HCV infection [10], cost-effectiveness of DAA treat-
ment [31–33], and importance of antiviral therapy to HCV elim-
ination efforts, the National Academies’ report recommended 
that public and private insurers should remove restrictions to 
DAAs that are not medically indicated and offer treatment to 
all chronic HCV-infected patients [9]. This recommendation 
is consistent with guidelines from the American Association 
for the Study of Liver Diseases/Infectious Diseases Society of 
America that recommend DAA treatment for all patients with 
chronic HCV infection [8]. The high incidence of denial of 
HCV therapy adversely impacts strategies for HCV elimination.
This study had several potential limitations. First, the spe-
cialty pharmacy did not electronically record certain data ele-
ments in a manner that could be obtained for the purpose of this 
study. The pharmacy did not record the date of the final dispos-
ition of the DAA prescription as a distinct data field, prevent-
ing us from calculating the median time to DAA fill or denial. 
Extractable HCV-related data were not available for all patients 
with a submitted DAA prescription. As a result, we were una-
ble to identify factors that were independently associated with 
absolute DAA denial. Data on interim denials and appeals were 
also not electronically recorded. Second, insurers did not pro-
vide the specialty pharmacy with their reasons for denial, which 
were only submitted to the patients. We therefore were unable 
to confirm the precise reasons for the high incidence of abso-
lute denial within and across insurance types. Finally, while our 
analysis was nationally representative, 8 states constituted the 
majority of the data, and data on 5 states were not available at all 
because the specialty pharmacy did not service those regions.
In conclusion, despite the availability of new DAA regimens 
and changes in restrictions to these therapies, absolute denials 
of DAA regimens by insurers have remained high and increased 
over time, regardless of type of insurance. These data provide 
evidence of a continued lack of access to HCV therapy across 
insurance types. To achieve the goal of HCV elimination [9], 
access to antiviral treatment must be improved.
