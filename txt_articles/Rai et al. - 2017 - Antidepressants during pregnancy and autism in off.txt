Abstract
Objectives To study the association between maternal use of
antidepressants during pregnancy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
in offspring.
Design Observational prospective cohort study with regression methods,
propensity score matching, sibling controls, and negative control
comparison.
Setting Stockholm County, Sweden.
Participants 254 610 individuals aged 4-17, including 5378 with autism,
living in Stockholm County in 2001-11 who were born to mothers who
did not take antidepressants and did not have any psychiatric disorder,
mothers who took antidepressants during pregnancy, or mothers with
psychiatric disorders who did not take antidepressants during pregnancy.
Maternal antidepressant use was recorded during first antenatal interview
or determined from prescription records.
Main outcome measure Offspring diagnosis of autism spectrum
disorder, with and without intellectual disability.
Results Of the 3342 children exposed to antidepressants during
pregnancy, 4.1% (n=136) had a diagnosis of autism compared with a
2.9% prevalence (n=353) in 12 325 children not exposed to
antidepressants whose mothers had a history of a psychiatric disorder
(adjusted odds ratio 1.45, 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.85).
Propensity score analysis led to similar results. The results of a sibling
control analysis were in the same direction, although with wider
confidence intervals. In a negative control comparison, there was no
evidence of any increased risk of autism in children whose fathers were
prescribed antidepressants during the mothers’ pregnancy (1.13, 0.68
to 1.88). In all analyses, the risk increase concerned only autism without
intellectual disability.
Conclusions The association between antidepressant use during
pregnancy and autism, particularly autism without intellectual disability,
might not solely be a byproduct of confounding. Study of the potential
underlying biological mechanisms could help the understanding of
modifiable mechanisms in the aetiology of autism. Importantly, the
absolute risk of autism was small, and, hypothetically, if no pregnant
women took antidepressants, the number of cases that could potentially
be prevented would be small.
Introduction
Depression is common in women of childbearing age, and in
Europe 3-8% of pregnant women are prescribed antidepressants
during pregnancy.1 The fetal safety of antidepressant exposure
during pregnancy has generated much debate after recent
concerns of a possible association with autism in exposed
offspring. In the past five years, several epidemiological
studies2-11 have assessed the relation between antidepressant use
during pregnancy and autism in offspring, but robust conclusions
have been elusive.12 13 Although most studies found evidence
of unadjusted associations, conclusions differed because of
concerns about “confounding by indication.” This was because
depression or other psychiatric indications for antidepressant
use could be associated with autism through genetic or
non-genetic pathways, and thus the possibility of the observed

 associations representing the risk of autism from the underlying
indication for prescription could not be ruled out.
All antidepressants cross the placental barrier and are available
to the developing fetus.14 Most of the commonly used
antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs) increase the availability of serotonin in the synaptic
cleft. The serotonergic system emerges early in embryogenesis
and is critical for neurodevelopment.15 In utero exposure to
serotonergic antidepressants in animal models have reported
associations with autism-like behaviours in the offspring.16 It is
therefore biologically plausible that similar effects could be
seen in humans. Disentangling a potential causal association of
antidepressants on the risk of autism from that observed from
confounding by indication is crucial to reduce clinical
uncertainty and help women make informed decisions regarding
the risks and benefits of antidepressant use during pregnancy.
In the absence of randomised controlled trials,7 however,
observational studies are the only available source of making
risk:benefit decisions in relation to antidepressant use during
pregnancy. It is well known that such studies are prone to
confounding bias, which can persist even after adjustment for
multiple confounders.17-19 Several approaches—such as
propensity score matching, negative controls, and sibling control
designs—have been suggested as strategies that could strengthen
causal inference in observational studies18 but remain largely
unused in investigations of this issue. To help to improve the
understanding of the association between antidepressant use
during pregnancy and autism in offspring, we applied a range
of such causal analytical methods on data from a large total
population cohort in Stockholm County. We hypothesised that
if the association between antidepressant use during pregnancy
and autism was likely to be causal, the results would be
consistent across a range of analytical methods with different
strengths and limitations and underlying assumptions.
Methods
Stockholm youth cohort
We used data from the Stockholm youth cohort, an
intergenerational record linkage study comprising all individuals
aged 0-17 living in Stockholm County in 2001-11 (n=735 096).
It contains prospectively recorded data on the cohort members
and their first degree relatives collected by record linkage with
a range of national and regional healthcare, social, and
administrative registries.20 21 The key for record linkage is the
unique national identity numbers assigned to all Swedish
residents. Figure 1⇓ shows the derivation of the sample for our
main analysis. We excluded cohort members born before 1996
as medication data were reliably collected only after this date.
We also excluded individuals not linked to the medical birth
register (such as those born abroad), those who could not be
linked to their biological mothers, adopted children, and those
living in Stockholm County for less than four years. The
residence requirement also allowed us to exclude children aged
under 4 in whom a diagnosis of autism might be less reliable.
Patient involvement
As mandated by the ethical permission, no attempts were made
to contact any cohort members for any aspect of this record
linkage study. As such, cohort members were not involved in
setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor were
they involved in developing plans for the design or
implementation of the study. No patients were asked to advise
on interpretation or writing up of results. There are no plans to
directly disseminate the results of the research to cohort
members, but dissemination to the general public and relevant
patient groups will be undertaken by using presentations and
social media.
Medication use during pregnancy (exposure)
We derived information on maternal use of antidepressants in
pregnancy from the medical birth register (since 1997) and
supplemented it with the prescribed drug register (available
from July 2005).22 23 The medical birth register contains
information on current medications being taken as reported by
pregnant women at their antenatal interview, at a median of 10
weeks’ gestation. The data are semi-automatically coded with
World Health Organization anatomical therapeutic classification
(ATC) codes. The medical birth register also contains free text
data, which we processed using a computerised search for
generic drug names and Swedish and international brand names
of antidepressants using fuzzy pattern matching to account for
unknown abbreviations, non-standard terms, and misspellings.24
The prescribed drug register contains data on drugs prescribed
and dispensed in ambulatory care to the entire Swedish
population, and the medications are coded with ATC codes. In
the prescribed drug register, we defined exposure to medication
during pregnancy as a prescription up to 30 days before the start
of the pregnancy (as estimated by the last menstrual period or
evidence from ultrasonography) until the birth date of the child.
We considered exposure to antidepressants if there was a record
of these in either the medical birth register or the prescribed
drug register. The validity of these two data sources have been
reported previously.22 23 We cross validated these two data
sources in our sample as data on antidepressant use were
available in both registers for cohorts born in 2006 and 2007.
Among these, 280 women out of 318 with a report of
antidepressant use in the medical birth register were also
recorded as having prescriptions for an antidepressant during
pregnancy in the prescribed drug register (88.1%).
We coded the medications as any antidepressant (ATC code
N06A) and also divided them into selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRI, ATC N06AB) and all other antidepressants.
We also categorised antidepressants based on their affinities for
the serotonin transporter into high versus medium or low
affinity.2
Ascertainment of autism with and without
intellectual disability (outcome)
We have described the multisource ascertainment of autism in
previous publications.7-21 In short, nearly all diagnoses of autism
in Sweden are provided through its free and universally
accessible system of health and care. We collected diagnostic
information from the relevant registers reflecting the pathways
to diagnosis. These sources included diagnoses recorded in the
national patient register, the Stockholm child and adolescent
mental health register, and the habilitation registers (ICD-9
(299), ICD-10 (F84), or DSM-IV (299) codes). We identified
co-occurring intellectual disability using ICD 9 (317-319),
ICD-10 (F70-79), and DSM-IV (317-319) in the child or adult
mental health registers or the national patient register. We have
previously carried out two validation procedures— a case note
validation study and a cross validation study of diagnosis of
autism spectrum disorder with a national twin study—and found
a high validity of the diagnoses recorded in the registers.20

 Other variables
Depression and other psychiatric disorders in
parents
We used ICD-9 and 10 diagnoses recorded in the national patient
register, which covers inpatient (with complete national coverage
since 1973) and outpatient specialist care (since 2001) to
ascertain depression and other maternal and paternal diagnoses
of other psychiatric indications for antidepressants (anxiety
disorder, bipolar disorder, non-affective psychoses,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, other stress related and neurotic
disorders) any time before the birth of the child as described
elsewhere.25 We supplemented these with diagnoses recorded
from the Stockholm adult psychiatric care register, which
comprises all publicly financed psychiatric care in Stockholm
County (constituting 85% of all such care) since 1997.26
We used prospectively collected data on maternal and paternal
age at birth of child (continuous variables used as restricted
cubic splines), fifths of family income adjusted for year of
ascertainment and family size, highest education of either parent
(≤9 years, 10-12 years, ≥13 years), maternal country of birth
(Sweden, Europe, other), parity (0, 1, 2, or more previous births)
as potential confounders. We also used several other variables
to construct the propensity score as described below. These
included maternal smoking and body mass index (BMI) recorded
at first antenatal visit, number of diagnoses of maternal
depression before birth, type of depression care (inpatient or
outpatient), and a large range of maternal neurological and
psychiatric conditions diagnosed before birth (see appendix).
Main analysis
We used R-3.1.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) for
analysis. After descriptive analyses, we used the following
analytic strategies to assess the risk of offspring autism in
mothers with antidepressant use during pregnancy.
Analysis 1: risk estimates of autism in children
of antidepressant users during pregnancy
compared with those with psychiatric disorders
but no antidepressant use
In our first analysis, we used logistic regression to derive odds
ratios and their 95% confidence intervals as estimates of relative
risks for autism in children of mothers who used antidepressants
during pregnancy compared with those with a psychiatric
disorder who did not use antidepressants. We used this stringent
comparison group to better account for confounding by
indication and because women without any psychiatric disorder
would be ineligible in hypothesised randomised controlled trials
of this issue. We adjusted the model for birth year to control
for period effects in medication use and ascertainment of
autism.21 We then adjusted for the presence or absence of
specific individual maternal psychiatric disorders (depression,
anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, non-affective psychotic
disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, adjustment disorders,
post-traumatic stress disorders, and other neurotic disorders)
that are indications for antidepressant use (model 2) and
additionally for child sex, parental ages, birth order, maternal
education, family income, and maternal country of birth (model
3). We calculated population attributable fractions (PAF) using
the fully adjusted model, estimating the proportion of autism
cases that would be prevented if no women with psychiatric
disorders were prescribed antidepressants, assuming a causal
association and no residual confounding. In a supplementary
analysis, we restricted the above treatment group to mothers
with antidepressant use who had a recorded psychiatric
diagnosis. We also described the associations by the most
commonly used individual antidepressants and grouped
antidepressants as SSRI and non-SSRIs, and by their serotonin
transporter receptor (SERT) affinity into high or low/medium
affinity.
Analysis 2: propensity score matched analysis
In our second analysis, we calculated propensity score matched
estimates for the above associations. Propensity score matching
helps to minimise the potential for confounding from observed
variables by comparing exposed and unexposed individuals
with similar characteristics.27 We estimated propensity scores
for antidepressant use during pregnancy using a boosted
classification and regression tree model,28 from the above
covariates and additional variables regarding maternal
psychiatric disorders including indicators of severity such as
the type of psychiatric care and number of previous care
episodes for depression, and the use of other medications (see
appendix for complete details). We matched children of women
who did and did not use antidepressants using the propensity
score using a maximum of 4:1 unexposed:exposed nearest
neighbour matching with a caliper of 0.20 SD and exact
matching on birth year, sex of child, number of depression
diagnoses, anxiety disorders, and obsessive compulsive disorder.
We estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence interval from
cluster robust logistic regression models.
Analysis 3: outcome discordant matched sibling
sets analysis
In our third analysis, we examined associations between
maternal antidepressant use in pregnancy and autism spectrum
disorder in matched sets of outcome discordant siblings (that
is, sibling sets in which there is at least one affected sibling and
one unaffected sibling, see appendix). Siblings share up to half
of their genetic makeup and generally share their early postnatal
environment. Sibling analysis can be a powerful method to
control for unmeasured confounders, such as maternal genetic
liability for neuropsychiatric conditions, when the confounders
are shared more than the exposure.29 We derived odds ratios
and confidence intervals using conditional logistic regression
models adjusted for sex, parity, and birth year.
Analysis 4: comparison with risk estimates for
paternal antidepressant use during pregnancy
as negative control
In our fourth analysis, we used paternal use of antidepressant
as a negative control exposure with the assumption that the
fathers would share many of the unmeasured confounders with
mothers, and, if a similar heightened risk of autism was
observable with paternal and maternal use of antidepressants,
the associations would be unlikely to reflect an in utero effect
of the medications.30 In these analyses, we used data for the
individuals born in 2006 and 2007, for whom we had data on
antidepressant prescriptions for the mothers and fathers, and
estimated the associations of antidepressant prescriptions in
fathers during the time of the mother’s pregnancy with the
outcomes.
Sensitivity analysis
In a sensitivity analysis, we estimated how robust the estimates
of associations between antidepressant exposure and autism
spectrum disorder were to unmeasured confounding in our
propensity score matched sample. We assumed a binary
confounder U increased the risk of autism and was more

 prevalent in antidepressant users than in non-antidepressant
users. Given specified parameters such as the relation of U with
autism spectrum disorder and the prevalence of U in
antidepressant users and non-users, we estimated odds ratios
and 95% confidence interval corrected for this unmeasured
confounder, specified over a range of plausible parameters.31
Missing data
There were few missing data on the key variables in our main
analysis (total 1.5% missing data). More data were missing in
some variables used in the generation of propensity scores, but
the boosted classification and regression tree model is able to
incorporate missing values in the prediction (see appendix).
Results
Table 1⇓ shows the descriptive statistics of the cohort in relation
to exposure to antidepressants during pregnancy or mental
disorders. Of the 3342 children exposed to antidepressants
during pregnancy, 136 (4.1%) had a diagnosis of autism. The
comparison group included 12 325 children of mothers with a
psychiatric disorder who did no use antidepressants during
pregnancy, of whom 353 (2.9%) had a diagnosis of autism. Of
the 238 943 cohort children for whom there was no record of
maternal history of psychiatric disorder or antidepressant use
during pregnancy, 4889 had autism (2.1%). The sample sizes
for all of the other analyses are provided in the appendix.
Exposure to antidepressants during pregnancy was associated
with a higher odds of a diagnosis of autism in offspring than
exposure to a maternal psychiatric disorder without
antidepressants (adjusted odds ratio 1.45, 95% confidence
interval 1.13 to 1.85; table 2⇓). This association was observed
only for autism without intellectual disability (1.57, 1.21 to
2.04). The results were similar when we restricted the
antidepressant exposure group to mothers who had a recorded
psychiatric diagnosis (table A in appendix). If we assume an
unconfounded causal association, the corresponding population
attributable fractions suggested that about 2% of autism cases
would be prevented if no pregnant woman with a psychiatric
disorder took antidepressants (2.1%, 95% confidence interval
−0.7% to 4.7%).
The propensity score analysis led to similar results to those
found with conventional regression models (table 3⇓ and
appendix). The numbers were smaller for the sibling control
analyses, but results again seemed consistent, though with wider
confidence intervals that included 1 (table 3⇓ and appendix).
In our negative control analysis, there was no evidence of an
increased risk of autism in children whose fathers were
prescribed antidepressants during the mothers’ pregnancy
(adjusted odds ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.88),
but the association with maternal prescriptions for
antidepressants continued to be observed (1.69, 1.06 to 2.72;
table 4⇓). In all analyses, the risk estimates were greater for
individuals without intellectual disability than those with
intellectual disability.
In sensitivity analysis, the results seemed to be moderately
robust to unmeasured confounding (table B in appendix). Tables
C and D in the appendix show the rates and associations of
autism in children exposed to the most commonly prescribed
individual antidepressants, also grouped into SSRI and non-SSRI
antidepressants as well as by their serotonin receptor affinity.
Although imprecision because of small numbers is evident, the
rates of autism seemed to be higher in children of mothers who
used clomipramine and venlafaxine and lowest in users of
paroxetine. Similar associations were observed for SSRI and
non-SSRI antidepressants in relation to risk. The point estimates
for the risk of autism in children of users of low/moderate SERT
affinity seemed to be greater than that in children of users of
high serotonin transporter affinity antidepressants, though the
confidence intervals overlapped.
Discussion
Principal findings
In this large Swedish population based study, we carried out
several analyses to further investigate the association between
antidepressant use during pregnancy and autism in offspring.
Our main findings were that children exposed to antidepressants
during pregnancy seemed to be at a higher risk of autism,
particularly autism without intellectual disability, than children
of mothers with psychiatric disorders who were not treated with
antidepressants during pregnancy. The findings seemed to be
consistent across traditional regression methods, propensity
score matching, and a sibling set comparison, and maternal
exposure to antidepressants during pregnancy had a strong
association with the outcomes whereas no such association was
observed with paternal exposure. This points to a potential effect
of antidepressant use on the risk of autism beyond any effect
caused by confounding by the underlying condition. It is
important to note, however, that the absolute risk was small,
and 4.1% of children exposed to antidepressants in utero had
autism compared with 2.9% of those with a maternal history of
psychiatric disorder. We estimated that only about 2% of autism
cases in this population would be theoretically prevented, if the
association was causal and no women with psychiatric disorders
used antidepressants during pregnancy.
Strengths and limitations
The main strengths of this study were the large sample size and
the range of analyses carried out to strengthen causal inference
beyond traditional methods. As the study included the total
population of Stockholm County and benefited from multisource
ascertainment of cases, as opposed to studies that rely on
hospital discharge diagnoses, the findings are likely to have
high external validity. The possibility of misclassification of
exposure cannot be ruled out, but the availability of both self
reported information from the medical birth register and
dispensation information from the prescribed drug register was
an advantage.22 23 As the absence of detailed measures of severity
of depression during pregnancy was a limitation, we used
propensity scores to match and therefore balance exposure
groups using a wide range of relevant characteristics. Because
of small numbers, we were not able to assess trimester specific
or dose response effects.
Comparison with other studies
This study builds on our previous case-control study,7 now
enhanced with a larger sample, a more stringent comparison
group of mothers with psychiatric disorders, and a range of
causal inference methods including propensity score matching,
a sibling comparison, and a negative control design to strengthen
confidence in the results. Although several large register based
studies have been carried out to date, the number of children
with autism who were also prenatally exposed to antidepressants
has been small, and some studies seemed to have substantially
under-ascertained autism. This has led to imprecise estimates,
which have been pervasive in all studies on this topic, including
those that have concluded that the association is likely to be
explained by confounding.6 8 Unlike some previous studies, we
were unable to study discontinuation of antidepressants before

 pregnancy as an additional negative control as the prescribed
drug register was operational only since 2005 and thus had
insufficient numbers. It should be noted that as a large
proportion of women discontinue drug treatment during
pregnancy,32 the cohorts that did have such data2-11 had more
statistical power to find an effect in the discontinuation group,
as opposed to effects in those who continued treatment during
pregnancy. The upper limits of the estimates of the associations
reported in these studies were consistent with the results we
report.
Meaning of the findings
The different analyses we used have different strengths and
limitations, but their findings seemed to triangulate, pointing
towards an association between maternal antidepressant use in
pregnancy and autism in offspring. On the other hand, the
increased risk was seen largely for autism without intellectual
disability, a phenotype that has been shown to be more
heritable,33 which could suggest a role for unmeasured genetic
confounding. Although the results of our sibling control analyses
were consistent with the other approaches we used, the numbers
were low, leading to an imprecise result. Larger sibling
comparisons in the future could elucidate the role of genetic
confounding in this relation. Furthermore, higher point estimates
for lower serotonin transporter receptor affinity antidepressants,
several of which are prescribed for more severe depression,2
could suggest a role of confounding by severity of depression,
which is difficult to measure in record linkage studies such as
this one. Taken together, it is difficult to conclusively dismiss
the possibility that the observed associations are wholly
attributable to confounding. We simulated the potential impact
of unmeasured confounding, which suggested that such an
unmeasured confounder would have to be a strong risk factor
for autism, exerting a confounding influence above and beyond
the multiple covariates already controlled for in the propensity
score matching.
Clinical implications
So what should families and doctors making decisions about
antidepressants during pregnancy make of such results? Firstly,
this and other studies clearly suggest that there is an increased
background risk of autism in children of women with psychiatric
conditions, regardless of antidepressant treatment. Secondly,
despite the observed relative risks, over 95% of women who
took antidepressants during pregnancy did not have a child with
autism. And, finally, if a causal link were robustly established,
and if no pregnant women took antidepressants during
pregnancy, only 2% of autism cases in this population would
be prevented. It is known that pregnant women perceive such
risks as greater than they are,34 and a balanced discussion in
relation to clinical decision making in the light of evolving but
yet inconsistent evidence is important. On the other hand, given
that this association might not solely be the byproduct of
confounding by indication, it is important to continue
investigation of possible underlying biological mechanisms that
could help us to better understand the aetiology of autism.

 What is already known about this topic
Several observational studies have reported associations between antidepressant use during pregnancy and autism in offspring
Whether this association is causal or confounded by indication is not clear
What this study adds
This large cohort study used various methods to deal with confounding, including traditional multivariable regression, propensity score
matching, sibling controls, and a negative control design
The results of all these analyses, which used different assumptions, seemed to be consistent with each other, suggesting that the
association between in utero exposure to antidepressants and autism might not be fully explained by confounding
The absolute risks were small so results should not be considered alarming, but the findings could be useful in a further understanding
of the aetiology of autism
