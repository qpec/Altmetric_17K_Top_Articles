Abstract 
Opioid addiction has devastating health and socio-economic consequences and current 
pharmacotherapy is limited and often accompanied by side effects, thus novel treatment is warranted. 
Traditionally, the neurohypophyseal peptide oxytocin (OT) is known for its effects in mediating 
reward, social affiliation/bonding and stress, as well as learning and memory. There is now strong 
evidence that oxytocin is a possible candidate for the treatment of drug addiction and depression-
addiction co-morbidities. This review summarizes and critically discusses the preclinical evidence 
surrounding the consequences of pharmacological manipulation of the oxytocinergic system on opioid 
addiction-related processes, as well as the effects of opioids on the OT system at different stages of 
the addiction cycle. The mechanisms underlying the effects of OT in opioid addiction, including 
oxytocins’ interaction with the monoaminergic, glutamatergic, opioidergic systems and its effect on 
the amygdala, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and on memory consolidation of traumatic 
memories are also reviewed. Moreover, we review clinical evidence on the effects of intranasal OT 
administration on opioid-dependent individuals and discuss the therapeutic potential along with the 
limitations that OT-based pharmacotherapies manifest. Review of these studies clearly indicates that 
the oxytocin system is profoundly affected by opioid use and abstinence and points towards the 
oxytocin system as an important target for developing pharmacotherapies for the treatment of opioid 
addiction and co-existing affective disorders, and thereby prevention of relapse. Therefore, clinical 
studies assessing the efficacy of OT-based pharmacotherapies in opioid addiction are warranted.

The oxytocin system 
Oxytocin (OT; IUPHAR; (Alexander et al., 2013a)), a nine amino acid peptide, was 
discovered by Sir Henry Dale in 1906 (Dale, 1906) and was the first peptide hormone to be sequenced 
and synthesized by Du Vigneaud (Du Vigneaud et al., 1953; Tuppy, 1953) (du Vigneaud et al., 1954). 
OT is synthesised in supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei of the hypothalamus. 
Besides the well-described peripheral function of OT (uterine contraction, milk ejection), its role as a 
neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in the brain has recently received increasing attention. OT-
producing neurons located in the hypothalamus innervate brain regions associated with stress, reward, 
mood, fear, emotionality and drug-seeking behaviour, such as the amygdala, septum, nucleus 
accumbens and the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, where OT receptors are expressed (see Gimpl et 
al., 2001). Upon diffusion, OT binds to nearby OT receptors, but also vasopressin receptors as the 
latter exhibits >85% homology with OT receptors (Busnelli et al., 2013). OT exerts its biological 
effects by binding to and activating G-protein-coupled receptors (Kimura et al., 1992); however, the 
molecular mechanism(s) of receptor activation and the intracellular signalling events following 
receptor activation are only partly understood. Activation of  the central OT receptors is involved in 
the modulation of several behaviours including autonomic function, social, sexual, pair-bonding, 
maternal, anxiety-, depressive- and psychotic-like behaviours (see Gimpl et al., 2001; Hashimoto et 
al., 2012). Recent advances in the field, both from preclinical and clinical studies, have revealed the 
potential of OT as an emerging therapeutic target for the treatment of mental disorders characterised 
by social dysfunction  such as autism, social anxiety disorders, depression, borderline personality 
disorders and schizophrenia (for extended review see Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2011) 
Based on the key role of oxytocin in social reward and stress regulation, there has been 
significant interest in the role of oxytocin in addiction. The present review focuses on novel and old, 
pre-clinical and clinical evidence, suggesting a central involvement of the oxytocinergic system in 
opioid addiction and addictive-related behaviours and discusses the potential of OT-based 
pharmacotherapy for the treatment of opioid addiction and relapse prevention. Underlying

neurobiological mechanism and limitations of oxytocin use as a pharmacotherapeutic agent are also 
discussed. 
Oxytocin and the reward system 
Increasing interest for the involvement of the oxytocinergic system in drug addiction came 
from findings suggesting that the brain systems involved in drug reward interact with those involved 
in natural rewards, such as sexual behaviour and social bonding; early findings from Carmichael et 
al., (1987) outlined the ability of sexual self-stimulation (mediated by the mesolimbic dopaminergic 
system) to increase plasma OT levels in humans. This findings was recently replicated by de Jong et 
al., (2015), who showed enhanced salivary OT concentrations due to sexual self-stimulation. Pre-
clinical findings also showed that partner bonds of prairie voles (a well-characterized monogamous 
species) are greatly influenced and regulated by  the OT neurotransmission in the brain (Insel et al., 
1992; Insel et al., 1994; Young, 2003). Oxytocinergic interactions with the dopaminergic system in 
the brain were shown to underlie this pair bonding behaviour (Liu et al., 2003), indicating possible 
association between the oxytocinergic and DAergic systems to regulate behaviour. Kovacs et al. 
(1990) showed that both central and peripheral administration of OT acutely increases DA utilisation 
within the Acb, while chronic systemic administration of OT decreases DA utilisation within the basal 
forebrain of mice (Kovacs et al., 1986).  
These interactions of the oxytocinergic with the DAergic systems suggest that oxytocin might 
have a critical role in the treatment of several DA-related disorders including drug addiction, and its 
beneficial effects might in fact be mediated by its interactions with several DAergic pathways in the 
brain.  
Drug addiction cycle 
Addiction is often characterised as a cycle of neurochemical and psychological changes that 
bring about a shift from a impulsive use of a drug to the compulsive use (see Koob et al., 2008). 
Acute administration of drugs of abuse activates the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward pathway in the 
brain, thus inducing hedonic effects that positively reinforce the user to repeat drug administration.

Upon repeated use of the drug, neuroadaptive tolerance to the rewarding effects of the drug is 
developed and an escalation of the dose is needed in order to achieve the same initial pleasurable 
effects (see Koob et al., 2001). During this period, positive reinforcement associated with acute drug 
administration is gradually replaced with a negative reinforcement, where the drug is taken to prevent 
the emergence of a negative withdrawal syndrome upon drug cessation. Acute withdrawal from drug 
use causes aversive drug-specific physical symptoms that are short-lived and for some drugs of abuse, 
including opioids, protracted withdrawal could cause long-term emotional impairment (see section 
below). In fact, drug users who have abstained from drug administration over a long period of time 
are still vulnerable to relapse to drug-seeking, particularly during re-exposure to the drug itself, to 
drug-associated environmental cues or following stress (see Koob et al., 2008). 
Comorbid drug addiction andmood disorders  
Chronic exposure to drugs of abuse, as well as prolonged abstinence from these drugs, is 
associated with lowered mood, increased anxiety, irritability and social withdrawal and isolation.  It 
has been estimated that 45% of the drug-dependent population has a comorbid psychiatric disorder, 
compared with 12% of the non-dependent population (Farrell et al., 2003). More specifically, 
according to epidemiological studies, there is a marked comorbidity (50-60%) between drug addiction 
and depression (Guest et al., 2011), which is a major issue in psychiatry as it is accompanied by more 
severe symptoms, longer illness duration, higher service utilisation and higher relapse rates (Alterman 
et al., 1996; Brooner et al., 1997; Kosten et al., 1986). Therefore, considering that antidepressants 
(see Riggs, 2003) and current addiction pharmacotherapies (see Kampman et al., 2005) have limited 
efficacy and are frequently accompanied by side effects in people suffering from this comorbidity, 
understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying comorbid depression and addiction 
disorderswill have important therapeutic implications in improving mental health care.  
Impact of opioid addiction on the oxytocinergic system 
The impact of opioid addiction on the oxytocinergic system and the effect of OT treatment in 
modulating the addiction-related behaviours are summarised in tables 1 and 2 respectively.

Acute opioid administration 
Studies showing a clear role of the oxytocinergic system in the acute reinforcing effects of the 
opiate morphine was among the first evidence pointing towards the involvement of oxytocin in drug 
addiction. In particular, acute morphine administration was shown to decrease hypothalamic OT 
release in female rodents (Clarke et al., 1979; Haldar et al., 1978). However, Kovacs et al. (1987a) 
observed increased OT immunoreactivity in extra-hypothalamic regions including hippocampus (Hip), 
amygdala (Amy) and basal forebrain of male mice, suggesting either differential effects of acute 
opioid administration on OT neurotransmission in different areas of the brain or a sex-dependent 
regulation of the oxytocinergic system upon an acute challenge with opioids.  
Chronic opioid administration 
Chronic administration of morphine induced a significant decrease in OT immunoreactivity in 
the Hip, decreased OT mRNA levels within the SON, median eminence and arcuate nucleus of the 
Hyp (ARC) and reduced brain OT synthesis, and plasma OT levels (Kovacs et al., 1987a; Laorden et 
al., 1998; You et al., 2000; Zanos et al., 2014a). This general down-regulation of the oxytocinergic 
system following chronic opioid administration, in comparison with the acute stimulatory effects of 
opioid administration in different brain regions, may be a result of several neuroadaptive changes in 
the oxytocinergic system caused by chronic exposure to opioids. We showed that this hypo-
oxytocinergic tone following chronic administration of opioids is linked with a marked increase in OT 
receptor binding within the olfactory nuclei and amygdala of mice (Zanos et al., 2014a); this effect 
might comprise a neuroadaptive/compensatory mechanism to counteract the decreased oxytocinergic 
signalling in the brain. Increased OT receptor binding in the brain following chronic opioid 
administration might also indicate a hypersensitivity of the oxytocinergic system during this period 
and should be taken into consideration when choosing the right oxytocin dosing regimen. In fact, 
while acute administration of low doses of OT lack deleterious side effects in humans  (see 
MacDonald et al., 2011), there is uncertainty on the effects of chronic administration of OT at both 
low and higher doses. Importantly, Peters et al., (2014) demonstrated that chronic (15-day) ICV 
infusion of OT, at a high dose (10 ng/h), induced a paradoxical anxiogenic phenotype in mice. This is

particularly important in the case of opioid addiction, where the oxytocin receptor system may be 
more sensitive based on findings from Zanos et al (2014a) showing an upregulation of OT receptors in 
an animal model of chronic opioid use. There, high doses of OT could be proven deleterious and even 
worsen the treatment prognosis in this population. Nonetheless, chronic administration of low doses of 
OT (1 ng/h; 19 days; ICV), prevented psychosocial stress-induced anxiety (Peters et al., 2014), 
indicating a dose-dependent effect of OT. These findings highlight that it may be important for future 
clinical studies assessing the effects of OT in opioid-dependent individuals, to use low doses of OT, in 
order to avoid potential undesirable side effects. 
Opioid conditioning/self-administration 
Interestingly and in contrast with the hypothesis that OT might be a potential target for the 
treatment of drug addiction, central administration of OT did not prevent the acquisition of morphine-
conditioning and it even increased the expression of morphine place preference when it was 
administered prior to the post-conditioning test in a conditioned-place preference (CPP) study in rats 
(Moaddab et al., 2015). In line with this finding, Van Ree et al., (1977) showed that peripherally 
administered OT slightly facilitated heroin self-administration in rats. These paradoxical effects 
of OT might be related to the direct actions of OT stimulation on the DAergic system (see Section 
“Oxytocin and the reward system”). The fact that activation of the central OT receptors directly 
increases striatal DAergic content (Georgiou et al., 2015b) and OT facilitates the effects of DA (Insel, 
2003), which is directly involved in the reinforcing properties of the drugs of abuse (Volkow et al., 
2006; Wong et al., 2006), indicates that OT administration might cause an enhanced morphine-
induced conditioned-place preference and/or heroin self-administration via mimicking and thus 
augmenting the hedonic effects of morphine. Indeed, similar to morphine (Lintas et al., 2011), OT 
administration was shown to increase the firing rate of accumbal neurons (Moaddab et al., 2015), 
indicating that there might be a possible additive effect of morphine and OT on the hyperexcitability 
of the mesolimbic DAergic neurons, which might have driven the enhanced morphine-induced 
conditioning. However, the choice of OT dose seems to be critical in determining the beneficial effects 
of the drug. Indeed, in the morphine CPP study (Moaddab et al., 2015), the authors used a dose of

0.2μg (intracerebroventricular; ICV), whereas Ibragimov et al.,  (1987b), using a dose of 0.2ng 
microinjected into the nucleus accumbens or ventral hippocampus demonstrated that OT was able to 
abolish heroin self-administration in heroin-dependent rats, an effect that was prevented by OT 
receptor blockade. These controversies highlight the importance for choosing the correct dose for OT 
to exert its beneficial effect, especially since OT is known to also bind to the vasopressin receptors at 
higher doses (Busnelli et al., 2013), which would plausibly cause the exact opposite behavioural 
effects  (Neumann et al., 2012). In support of this, Peters et al., (2014) showed dose-dependent 
differential effects of chronic central administration of OT on anxiety, stress-related behaviours, as 
well as OT receptor binding in different brain regions.. 
Opioid Tolerance 
OT was also shown to modulate short- and long-term opioid tolerance. In particular, both 
peripheral and central OT administration dose-dependently attenuated the development of analgesic 
morphine and heroin tolerance in rodents, and a single OT injection also blocked the expression of 
heroin tolerance following repeated heroin administration (Kovacs et al., 1985c; Kovacs et al., 1984; 
Kovacs et al., 1998; Kovacs et al., 1987c). These results strongly suggest that OT can rapidly 
modulate both the early development, as well as the expression of an already developed opioid 
tolerance. Interestingly, OT treatment reduced heroin self-administration in heroin-tolerant (Kovacs et 
al., 1985b), but not in non-tolerant rats (Kovacs et al., 1998), although it inhibited the development of 
tolerance to morphine-induced hyper-locomotion in mice (Kovacs and Telegdy, 1987), which might 
indicate differential effect of OT on the adaptive versus acute opioid tolerance processes. Importantly, 
the lateral septum was shown to mediate the inhibitory effect of OT on heroin self-administration since 
direct microinjection of OT within this brain region abolished heroin self-administration in heroin-
tolerant rats (Ibragimov et al., 1987a). While the effect of OT in reducing opioid tolerance may be 
desirable in increasing the therapeutic efficacy of opioid replacement therapy, it may also be 
dangerous as it could lead to opioid toxicity in patients receiving opioid replacement therapy, 
especially in cases of accidental opioid overdose. In addition, if tolerance to the respiratory depressant 
effects of opioids is also reduced by OT, this effect could lead to a higher risk of opioid overdose,

which has been also suggested to be the case with the ethanol effect on tolerance to the respiratory 
depressant effects of opioids (Hill et al., 2016). 
Opioid Withdrawal/relapse 
The first evidence for a role of OT on the regulation of opioid withdrawal came from Kovacs 
et al., (1985d) who showed that peripheral OT administration decreases naloxone-precipitated 
morphine withdrawal symptoms in rodents. To unravel the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect 
of OT on opioid withdrawal symptoms, later studies investigated the effect of pharmacologically-
induced opioid withdrawal on OT neurotransmission. In particular, Bicknell et al., (1988), 
demonstrated that naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal, a protocol which is widely used to 
precipitate acute physical opioid withdrawal symptoms, increases plasma OT levels, as well as the 
firing rate of SON OT neurons in chronically morphine-treated lactating rats. Additionally, naloxone 
administration also produced a large increase in OT levels within the CSF of opioid-dependent rats 
(Coombes et al., 1991). Finally, naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal increased Fos protein 
expression within the SON (Johnstone et al., 2000; Murphy et al., 1997) and OT mRNA levels within 
the median eminence (ME) and PVN (Laorden et al., 1998), which may illustrate an increase in the 
biosynthesis of OT. These findings are somewhat unexpected since OT treatment prevents naloxone-
precipitated withdrawal symptoms at a time point where OT neurotransmission is already enhanced. 
Taken together, these results might indicate a possible OT receptor-independent mechanism of action 
of exogenously administered OT on the regulation of opioid withdrawal physical symptoms. Indeed, it 
has been demonstrated that OT might exert an OT receptor-independent action at GABAA receptor δ 
subunit to regulated addiction-related processes (Bowen et al., 2015). 
In contrast to the pharmacologically-induced morphine withdrawal findings, recent studies 
have demonstrated a differential regulation of the oxytocinergic system following non-precipitated, 
long-term spontaneous withdrawal from opioid treatment in mice. Zanos et al. (2014a) found 
decreased hypothalamic OT levels and increased OT receptor binding in the olfactory nuclei, piriform 
cortex, septum and amygdala following spontaneous (non-precipitated) withdrawal from chronic 
escalating-dose morphine administration in mice. These neuroadaptive alterations of the oxytocinergic

system were concomitant with the emergence of emotional deficits including depressive-, anxiety-like 
behaviors and social impairment at least in an animal model setting. We also demonstrated that 
carbetocin, an oxytocin analogue, was able to prevent morphine withdrawal-induced emotional 
impairment, as well as stress- and priming-induced reinstatement of morphine conditioned preference 
in mice (Georgiou et al., 2015b; Zanos et al., 2014a). These findings demonstrate the ability of OT 
treatment to reduce the physical and emotional symptoms of opioid abstinence, suggesting a promising 
pharmacotherapy for comorbid mood and substance abuse disorders, as well asrelapse prevention; 
thus, warranting a clinical investigation in opioid abusers and abstinent individuals undergoing 
detoxification.  
Mechanisms underlying the effect of OT in opioid addiction 
The mechanism/s by which OT exerts its effect on drug-related behaviours are complex and not fully 
understood. Here, we outline some of the main suggested mechanisms based on pre-clinical and 
clinical evidence. 
Interactions with the monoaminergic system 
Dopamine: The most characterised link between the oxytocinergic and the DAergic systems 
stems from the fact that OT-mediated social affiliative behaviours are also linked to key alterations in 
the DAergic reward system (Skuse et al., 2009; Young et al., 2004). OT is known to modulate DA 
turnover and OT receptors have been shown to functionally interact with the DA D2 receptor in the 
nucleus accumbens (Romero-Fernandez et al., 2012). Thus, it is perhaps not surprising that the 
DAergic system is involved in the mechanism(s) underlying the effect of OT in modulating addictive-
related behaviours. For instance, Qi et al., (2008) demonstrated that OT administration prevents 
methamphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion via decreasing methamphetamine-associated reduction 
on DA turnover in the mesolimbic system of the brain. In addition, intra-prefrontal cortex 
administration of OT prevented amphetamine-induced impaired pair bond formation via blocking 
amphetamine-induced increases in DA levels in the Acb (Young et al., 2014).  With regards to opioid 
addiction, Georgiou et al., (2015b) showed that administration of the oxytocin analogue carbetocin

increases DA turnover in the striatum of mice, which was associated with the ability of the drug to 
prevent both priming- and stress-induced reinstatement to opioid conditioned-place preference.  
Noradrenaline: Some preliminary evidence for an interaction between the oxytocinergic and 
noradrenergic systems exists. OT administration enhances noradrenaline release in the SON 
nucleus of the hypothalamus, which then activates hypothalamic OT neurons (Onaka et al., 2003). 
Importantly, we have recently shown that the prevention of morphine primed-reinstatement of opioid 
seeking behaviour following administration of OT is directly associated with the ability of OT to 
suppress striatal noradrenaline turnover in mice (Georgiou et al., 2015b), thus suggesting the presence 
of a noradrenergic mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of OT in opioid relapse prevention. 
Nonetheless, this was not the case with stress-induced reinstatement indicating differential regulation 
of OT-noradrenaline interactions in mediating diverse reinstatement triggers. 
5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin): Preliminary data suggest possible interactions between the 
oxytocinergic and serotonergic systems, which might be implicated in the modulation of several 
neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, serotonergic terminals originating from the dorsal and 
median raphe nuclei were shown to project to the PVN magnocellular neurons (Larsen et al., 1996; 
Sawchenko et al., 1983), where they possibly regulate OT release via an interaction with the serotonin 
receptors (Ho et al., 2007; Jorgensen et al., 2003). In addition, administration of  a 
serotonergic agonist to healthy individuals increased plasma OT levels (Lee et al., 2003). Although 
the involvement of the serotonergic system in the mechanisms underlying the effects of OT on opioid 
addiction-related behaviours has not been investigated to date, it is important to pursue research 
aiming to understand whether OT-based pharmacotherapies, via interacting with the serotonergic 
system, are effective in treating opioid addiction-mood disorder comorbidities, considering the 
evidence that serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant drugs (i.e., citalopram and fluvoxamine), 
may exert their antidepressant effects partly via interacting with the oxytocinergic system (de Jong et 
al., 2007; Swaab et al., 2000; Uvnas-Moberg et al., 1999). 
Interactions with the glutamatergic system 
  
 
This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. 
While the role of glutamatergic neurotransmission in opioid addiction has not yet been 
identified, there is evidence to suggest a key involvement of glutamate in the pharmacological effects 
of OT in modulating addictive-related behaviours. In particular, Qi et al., (2009) showed that OT 
treatment abolished stress-induced, but not methamphetamine-priming increases in glutamate levels in 
the medial prefrontal cortex of mice undergoing reinstatement of methamphetamine conditioned-place 
preference. Interestingly, this effect was associated with the ability of OT to prevent stress-induced, 
but not drug-primed reinstatement to methamphetamine place preference. 
Role of the amygdala 
Intranasal OT has been shown to decrease anxiety via reducing amygdala reactivity in 
response to threat (Baumgartner et al., 2008; Domes et al., 2007; Kirsch et al., 2005; Labuschagne et 
al., 2010). Since there is high comorbidity between drug addiction and anxiety disorders, it is 
plausible that OT may act within this precise brain network to induce its restorative effect on 
recovering emotional impairment in drug-dependent individuals. Indeed, we have shown that chronic 
administration of morphine (Zanos et al., 2014a), cocaine (Georgiou et al., 2015a; Georgiou et al., 
2016b), methamphetamine (Georgiou et al., 2016a; Zanos et al., 2014b) and nicotine (Zanos et al., 
2015) induces an upregulation of the OT receptor binding in the amygdala of mice, indicating a 
possible common neuroadaptation of the oxytocinergic system in response to different classes of 
drugs of abuse. Although the exact mechanisms underlying these neuroadaptations need further 
investigation, it is likely that these changes of the amygdalar OT receptor system are involved in the 
modulation of drug/emotional impairment comorbidity. Given the anxiolytic, antidepressant and 
social-enhancing effects of OT administration in humans when administered via an intranasal spray 
(Baumgartner et al., 2008; Di Simplicio et al., 2009; Kirsch et al., 2005), or in animal models when 
administered centrally or peripherally (Dabrowska et al., 2011; Windle et al., 2004), this 
dysregulation (upregulation) of the OT receptor system in the amygdala may constitute a common 
neurobiological mechanism to plausibly counteract the negative emotional state induced by chronic 
drug administration. Therefore, the use of an OT-based pharmacotherapy to preferably jump-start the 
amygdala to attenuate emotional distress, including anxiety, and activate stress-coping mechanisms

could be an important area for research and further our understanding of the role of the amygdalar 
oxytocinergic system in controlling substance use. 
Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity 
There is evidence to support a regulatory role of the HPA axis activity on the anxiolytic and 
antidepressant effects of OT. Specifically, i.c.v administration of OT decreased stress-induced 
corticosterone release in rats (Windle et al., 1997). Moreover, intra-PVN administration of an OT 
receptor antagonist increased basal ACTH levels, while it reduced ACTH release in response to a 
forced-swim stress in male rats (Neumann et al., 2000a; Neumann et al., 2000b). These findings 
indicate a possible tonic inhibition of the HPA axis activity by OT and an enhancing action under 
stress conditions. With regards to opioid addiction, we have shown that the effect of carbetocin in 
preventing stress- (Zanos et al., 2014a) and priming-induced (Georgiou et al., 2015b) reinstatement of 
morphine-seeking does not depend on changes in the HPA axis activity, since we did not observe any 
effects of carbetocin on plasma corticosterone levels following either priming- or stress- induced 
reinstatement in mice. However, the effects of OT or OT-based drug administration on the central 
corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system cannot be precluded since there is evidence for a direct 
regulation of the CRF neurotransmission by OT (Bulbul et al., 2011; Jurek et al., 2015; Pati et al., 
2015). 
Extinction of traumatic memories 
Although not tested in the context of drug addiction, there is compelling evidence to suggest 
that OT facilitates extinction of memories associated with fear. For instance, ICV administration of 
OT prior to fear conditioning does not appear to have any effect on fear learning; however later fear 
extinction is facilitated by OT, while  OT receptor antagonists administration impairs extinction 
learning and retrieval (Singewald et al., 2015). Therefore, it is conceivable that OT may be able to 
alleviate the affective emotional consequences of drug addiction and prevent relapse by interfering 
with the consolidation of fear memories, making these memories weaker and more susceptible to 
extinction (Singewald et al., 2015). This hypothesis warrants further exploration.

Interactions with the endogenous opioid system 
Opioid peptide regulation of the OT system has been suggested to at least partly underlie the 
effects of opioid drugs on the OT system. In fact, opioid peptide neuronal fibers and terminals are 
located in close proximity with OT neurons within the Hyp (Bicknell et al., 1988). Moreover, μ-opioid 
receptors (μ receptors) are highly expressed in the Hyp, and particularly within the SON and PVN 
nuclei, where oxytocinergic neurons project from (Atweh et al., 1983). These studies indicate possible 
interactions between the opioid and oxytocinergic systems. Indeed, it was recently demonstrated with 
the use of receptor autoradiographic binding in μ receptor knockout mice, the presence of brain 
region-specific interactions between the μ receptor and OT receptor systems (Georgiou et al., 2015b; 
Gigliucci et al., 2014), which may be involved in the effects OT on the modulation of opioid-
associated behaviours discussed in this review. Furthermore, a remarkable decrease in OT gene 
expression was observed in the Acb of  mice lacking the μ receptor gene (Becker et al., 2014), further 
supporting a close interaction between the opioidergic and oxytocinergic system. 
OT as a potential pharmacotherapy for opioid addiction: From bench to bedside 
Clinical studies 
 
There is currently a limited number of clinical trials investigating the efficacy of OT in the 
treatment of drug addiction.  With regards to opioid addiction, there have been only two clinical 
studies to-date that assessed the effects of intranasal OT in opioid-dependent patients (Stauffer et al., 
2016; Woolley et al., 2016). The main outcome of both studies demonstrates a safe and good 
tolerability profile of OT administration in opioid-dependent individuals, even after repeated 
administration for two weeks. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 
Wooley et al., (2016) reported that intranasal OT administration (40 IU) did not improve cue-induced 
craving in opioid-dependent subjects receiving opioid replacement therapy. In contrast, in a placebo-
controlled trial of individuals  undergoing methadone replacement treatment for opioid and co-
occurring cocaine use disorder, placebo-treated patients reported an increase for heroin craving, while 
individuals who received intranasal OT treatment (40 IU; two times daily x two weeks) did not 
exhibit increased craving response (Stauffer et al., 2016), providing some promise for the treatment of

this population. No evidence of a reduction of opioid tolerance following OT administration was 
observed in these trials. This is especially important considering the findings of OT-induced opioid 
tolerance observed in animals, which could have potentially led to fatal overdose  
Therapeutic potential of OT in opioid addiction treatment and addiction-emotional impairment 
comorbidities 
In light of the literature reviewed here, OT has unambiguously a key role in mediating several 
opioid addiction related behavioural and neurochemical processes and can be considered a promising 
target for the treatment of opioid dependence and emotional impairment comorbidity. One important 
factor that distinguishes OT from currently available medications is that it does not show abuse or 
addiction potential. In fact, the doses used in the pre-clinical studies, which revealed that OT induces 
conditioned-place preference, are way higher than the doses used in the clinical trials (Liberzon et al., 
1997). Evidence also suggests that patients treated with OT could not discriminate between placebo or 
the actual drug (MacDonald et al., 2011), further supporting the lack of rewarding properties of OT at 
least at that doses ranging from 18-40 IU. However, future studies should assess the possibility of any 
rewarding effects following chronic administration of OT in humans. 
 
Another unique property of OT that is particularly important for the treatment of opioid 
addiction and/or comorbid mood disorders is related to its prosocial effects (Churchland et al., 2012). 
Prolonged use of drugs of abuse results in disintegration of the social lives of drug addicts and may 
lead to social isolation and poor decision-making in their social domain at the expense of compulsive 
pre-occupation with the drug and its related cues (Dawe et al., 2009; Volkow et al., 2011).  Impaired 
social behaviours have been linked with the propensity of addicts to relapse after long-term abstinence 
(Tokar et al., 1975). Therefore, considering the therapeutic effects of social support programs (e.g. 
Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous) and the benefits of social rehabilitation and social 
reintegration in keeping addicts abstinent from the drug (Koerner, 2010; McGregor et al., 2012), the 
current findings for the pro-social effects of OT may implicate its use as an adjunct to Cognitive 
Behavioural Therapy as a novel effective “psycho-biological therapy” for the prevention of relapse to

drug-seeking. In support of this, OT and social support have been shown to interact and exert a stress-
buffering effect following a psychosocial stress challenge in humans (Heinrichs et al., 2003) 
Moreover, there is clinical evidence for a beneficial role of OT in the treatment of other disorders 
characterised by social cognitive impairment including autistic spectrum disorders and schizophrenia 
(Carter, 2007; Heinrichs et al., 2007). 
Limitations 
One concern for studies looking at effects of exogenously administered OT is that it has a 
very short plasma (3-5 min) and central (30 min) half-life (Ludwig et al., 2006; Uvnas-Moberg, 
1998). However, intranasal administration of OT has been shown to induce more prolonged release of 
at least 80 min (Burri et al., 2008) and has extended biological (endocrine and sexual) activity, even 
after a single dose in humans (Uvanas-Moberg et al., 2005). Moreover, intranasally administered OT 
has been shown to cross the BBB and to exert central effects (Born et al., 2002; Chang et al., 2012; 
Pedersen et al., 2013). Nonetheless, the development of smaller non-peptide OT agonists with high 
specificity for central OT receptors is undoubtedly desirable. 
Although the outcome from multitude of clinical trials using intranasal oxytocin treatment 
points towards a safe profile of the drug (MacDonald et al., 2011), there are some unanswered 
questions related to its safety following chronic use in drug-dependent individuals. In fact, high doses 
of intravenous  OT have been associated with cardiovascular side-effects including hypotension and 
myocardial ischemia (Dyer et al., 2011) or electrolyte imbalances due to its structural similarity to 
arginine vasopressin and its effects in the kidneys (Rasmussen et al., 2004). Importantly, OT 
administration at high doses could also activate the vasopressin V1A receptors in the brain, which may 
actually lead to the opposite behavioural responses (Neumann et al., 2012). Concerns also include the 
safety of OT administration in females at different reproductive phases due to the peripheral effects of 
OT (i.e. milk ejection, labour induction), as well as the regulation of OT by the gonadal hormones 
(McCarthy, 1995; Zhang et al., 1991).

Moreover, caution needs to be applied when choosing the dose of OT for chronic intranasal 
administration. In fact, Peters et al., (2014) showed that chronic ICV infusion of OT (15 days) at a 
high dose (10 ng/h), induces an anxiogenic phenotype; however, low doses of OT(1 ng/h for 19 days) 
prevented psychological stress-induced hyper-anxiety in rats. These findings highlight the need for a 
deeper understanding of chronic treatment and dose-dependent effects of OT before we consider OT 
for long-term therapeutic use for the treatment of psychiatric conditions such as addiction.

Concluding remarks 
Pre-clinical and clinical evidence clearly indicates OT’s potential as an effective next-
generation treatment (possibly as an ad-hoc medication) for opioid addiction and comorbid mood 
disorders, as well as prevention of relapse. Therefore, there is a need for future clinical studies to 
directly assess the effect of OT-based pharmacotherapies in the different stages of opioid addiction 
and to determine doses that would avoid any detrimental side effects.
