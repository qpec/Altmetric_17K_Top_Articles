Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the primary cause of uncom-
plicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Whereas most infections are
isolated cases, 1 in 40 women experience recurrent UTIs. The rise in
antibiotic resistance has complicated the management of chronic UTIs
and necessitates new preventative strategies. Currently, no UTI vac-
cines are approved for use in the United States, and the development
of a highly effective vaccine remains elusive. Here, we have pursued a
strategy for eliciting protective immunity by vaccinating with small
molecules required for pathogenesis, rather than proteins or pep-
tides. Small iron-chelating molecules called siderophores were se-
lected as antigens to vaccinate against UTI for this vaccine strategy.
These pathogen-associated stealth siderophores evade host immune
defenses and enhance bacterial virulence. Previous animal studies
revealed that vaccination with siderophore receptor proteins protects
against UTI. The poor solubility of these integral outer-membrane
proteins in aqueous solutions limits their practical utility. Because
their cognate siderophores are water soluble, we hypothesized that
these bacterial-derived small molecules are prime vaccine candidates.
To test this hypothesis, we immunized mice with siderophores con-
jugated to an immunogenic carrier protein. The siderophore–protein
conjugates elicited an adaptive immune response that targeted bac-
terial stealth siderophores and protected against UTI. Our study has
identified additional antigens suitable for a multicomponent UTI vac-
cine and highlights the potential use of bacterial-derived small mole-
cules as antigens in vaccine therapies.

oth the physical and financial burdens of urinary tract in-
fections (UTIs) are staggering. Half of all women experience
a symptomatic UTI in their lifetime (1). And of those women,
almost half suffer a reoccurrence within the next year (1). In the
United States, where the annual societal cost of UTI is likely
underestimated at $3.5 billion (2), 4 million women have UTIs
continuously (3). Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is a sub-
class of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) and is the etio-
logical agent for 80% of all uncomplicated UTIs (1). In 2006, there
were 11 million physician visits, over 1.7 million emergency room
visits, and 479,000 hospitalizations of both men and women in
the United States for UTI (2, 4). Altogether, these estimates place
UTIs first among kidney and urologic diseases in terms of total cost.
UTIs occur when bacteria, most commonly UPEC (5), con-
taminate the periurethral area and traverse the urethra to colonize
the bladder and its underlying epithelium, causing cystitis (6, 7). If
left untreated, UPEC may ascend the ureters and establish a sec-
ondary infection in the kidney parenchyma, causing pyelonephritis.
At this juncture, UPEC can elicit serious complications, including
renal scarring, septicemia, and death.
UTIs are routinely treated with antibiotic therapy, including
trimethroprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP–SMX) and ciprofloxacin.
Women experiencing at least two UTIs per year are frequently
given antibiotics prophylactically (8). Not surprisingly, the rates of
resistance to these antibiotics in UPEC strains have steadily risen
over the past few decades. In the United States, Canada, and
elsewhere, ∼10–25% of uncomplicated UTI isolates are resistant to
TMP–SMX (9–11). This trend is forcing physicians to reach for
more expensive and sometimes less effective drugs to treat UTIs
(10, 12, 13). Even more troubling is the rise in multidrug resistance
among UPEC strains, as a recent international study found that
over 10% of E. coli cystitis isolates are resistant to at least three
different classes of antimicrobial agents (14). These trends chal-
lenge the prescription choices of physicians to address shifting
microbial susceptibilities (15).
To compound the danger of antibiotic resistance, there are no
currently licensed vaccines in the United States to combat recurrent
UTIs in women. In Europe, two vaccines against UTIs called
SolcoUrovac and Uro-Vaxom are licensed for use in women with
recurrent UTIs (16). SolcoUrovac is a vaginal suppository contain-
ing 10 heat-killed UPEC strains that provides relatively poor pro-
tection in the absence of frequent administration (17). Uro-Vaxom
is an oral capsule containing a lyophilized mixture of membrane
proteins from 18 UPEC isolates that is expected to be taken daily.
Although this vaccine offers protection against UPEC, its success is
limited due to toxicity and poor adherence to the daily regimen (18).
Due to these drawbacks, no vaccines are licensed for use in the
United States (19). Given the paucity of effective vaccines, the in-
creasing rate of UPEC antibiotic resistance, the decline in novel
antibiotic scaffolds, and the need to reduce healthcare expenditures,
new therapeutic strategies to manage UTIs must be explored.
Previous work using unbiased genomic and proteomic screens
identified bacterial targets that are expressed in vivo by UPEC
during UTIs in women, reside on the surface of the bacterium, are
immunogenic, and carry out a critical function for survival of E. coli
in the host (20). Six bacterial iron acquisition system proteins met all
criteria. These findings are supported by a rich history of genomic,
Significance
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are primarily caused by uropatho-
genic Escherichia coli (UPEC), and 1 in 40 women experience
chronic UTIs during their lifetime. The antibiotic courses required
to treat infections promote antibiotic resistance, and current vac-
cine options offer limited protection. We have pioneered a strat-
egy using small iron-chelating compounds called siderophores as
vaccine antigens. These siderophores are not produced by com-
mensal bacteria and are required for UTI. The siderophore vaccines
reported here are easy to formulate and reduce bacterial burdens
in a murine model of UTI. This report highlights the untapped
resource of bacteria-specific small molecules as potential vaccine
antigens and provides a proof of principle for incorporating these
compounds into multicomponent vaccines for the prevention of
bacterial infections.

 transcriptomic, and proteomic studies that have also identified iron
acquisition systems as prime anti-UTI targets (21–27).
Iron is an essential cofactor in many biological processes, in-
cluding DNA synthesis, electron transfer, and central metabolism
(28). Iron acquisition is generally required for bacterial growth
during infection (28, 29). One facet of innate immunity, coined
“nutritional immunity,” restricts bacterial infections by limiting
access to critical metal cofactors (28, 30). The mammalian host
limits intracellular and freely circulating iron by sequestering iron in
proteins such as lactoferrin, transferrin, ferritin, and hemoglobin
(31). Notably, the primary site of UPEC infection, the bladder, has
lower iron levels than serum (32). Thus, it is not surprising that over
14 gene clusters implicated in iron acquisition have been identified
as important virulence factors in UPEC strains (33–37); these gene
clusters encode up to four siderophore biosynthesis and uptake
systems as well as receptors for the acquisition of heme, ferric
citrate, and ferrous iron. Of the many classes of siderophores,
UPEC strains typically encode at least three of the following
siderophores: yersiniabactin (Ybt), aerobactin (Aer), enterobactin
(Ent), and the glucosylated Ent, salmochelin (Glc-Ent) (38, 39).
Bacterial iron acquisition is a natural target of the host immune
system. For example, serum albumin and lipocalin-2 bind and in-
activate Ent (40, 41). To evade host immunity, pathogenic E. coli
strains typically encode a combination of Ybt, Aer, and Glc-Ent
stealth siderophores, which are not recognized by host defenses
(39). By evading host defenses to secure nutrient iron, Ybt, Aer,
and Glc-Ent serve as urovirulence factors (33, 36). Notably, Ybt and
Aer are more prevalent among pathogenic E. coli strains than
commensal isolates (39). Moreover, previous studies that system-
atically assessed the use of surface-exposed iron receptors as po-
tential vaccine antigens found that two of the stealth siderophore
receptors, those that recognize Ybt and Aer, protect against UTI
(20, 42, 43). The hydrophobic nature of these outer-membrane
receptors, however, makes these antigens insoluble in water, com-
plicating the purification and formulation of the vaccines. Here, we
examine the potential use of the small-molecule siderophores Ybt
and Aer as protective vaccine antigens that could bolster the effi-
cacy of other immunoprotective strategies.
Results
By virtue of the confirmed importance of Ybt and Aer in uropa-
thogenesis (33–37), the proven efficacy of their receptors in ex-
perimental vaccines (20, 42), their increased prevalence among
pathogenic E. coli (39), and amenable biochemical features, we
hypothesized that Ybt and Aer could represent valid vaccine can-
didates. Because the siderophores are small (<564 Da) and unlikely
to be immunogenic, Ybt and Aer were conjugated to cationized
BSA (cBSA), an immunogenic carrier protein that has aminoethyl-
capped carboxylic acids (44–46). The positive surface charge of
cBSA increases vaccine binding to immune cells, and the amino-
ethyl modifications improve the coupling reaction by both elimi-
nating carboxylic acids and providing additional primary amines
on the carrier protein (44–46). Both Ybt and Aer have carboxylic
acid moieties; thus, standard amide coupling conditions were
used to prepare the cBSA–siderophore conjugates using 1-ethyl-
3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) as the coupling
reagent (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 A and B). cBSA incubated with EDC
in the absence of siderophore was used as a negative control.
Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry on
trypsin-digested cBSA–siderophore conjugates confirmed link-
age of the siderophores to cBSA. For the cBSA–Aer conjugate,
peptide fragment ions supporting the linkage of Aer to Lys266,
aminoethyl-Asp474, and aminoethyl-Glu267 were detected (SI Appendix,
Fig. S2 A–C and Tables S1–S3). For cBSA–Ybt, peptide ions sup-
porting the linkage of Ybt to aminoethyl-Asp272 and Lys437 were
detected (SI Appendix, Fig. S2D and Tables S4 and S5). Altogether,
these data confirm at least two conjugation sites on cBSA for
each siderophore.
To assess the efficacy of vaccination with the stealth siderophore
conjugates, mice were immunized intranasally with 10 μg of vaccine
conjugate prepared in 20 μL of PBS (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C). Three
vaccine groups were examined along with a cBSA control, including
cBSA–Ybt, cBSA–Aer, or a 1:1 mixture of cBSA–Ybt:cBSA–Aer,
which was composed of 5 μg of each conjugate. Previous reports
have shown that intranasal vaccination provides the most consistent
protection in murine UTI vaccine studies (20, 42, 47). Therefore,
mice were boosted intranasally with 20 μL of PBS containing 2.5 μg
of vaccine conjugate 7 and 14 d postimmunization. UPEC strain
HM69, a strain recently isolated from a patient with uncomplicated
cystitis, was selected for challenge because it encodes Ent, Ybt, and
Aer (38). On day 21 postimmunization, mice were transurethrally
inoculated with 108 colony-forming units (cfus) of HM69, and after
48 h, the bacterial burdens in the urinary tract were quantified.
Vaccination with cBSA–Ybt reduced bacterial burden by 12-
fold in the urine (P = 0.04) and 10-fold in the kidneys (P = 0.01),
whereas cBSA–Aer reduced bacterial burden by 19-fold (P = 0.02)
in the urine (Fig. 1 A–C). Coimmunization with 1:1 cBSA–Ybt:Aer
also decreased bacterial burdens in the urine by 14-fold (P = 0.3)
and, most dramatically, reduced bacterial burden in the kidneys by
126-fold (P = 0.002) (Fig. 1 A–C). Altogether these data demon-
strate that the siderophore–protein conjugates significantly reduce
the bacterial burden in experimental UTI, particularly dissemina-
tion to the kidneys. At the time of sacrifice, a subset of the kidneys
and bladders from infected mice were fixed in neutral buffered
formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with he-
matoxylin and eosin (H&E). Five-micrometer histologic sections
were randomized and blindly scored for neutrophilic inflammation
by a board-certified veterinary pathologist. Scores were semi-
quantitative and ranged from 0 (no inflammation) to 3 (severe
inflammation) (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Vaccination with cBSA–Ybt,
cBSA–Aer, and 1:1 cBSA–Ybt:cBSA–Aer significantly reduced
pyelonephritis and overall inflammation scores (Fig. 1 D–F).
To ascertain whether the vaccine specifically targets Ybt and Aer,
three isogenic mutants were generated; E. coli HM69 ybtS::cam
(ybtS) and iucA::kan (iucA) have the Ybt and Aer biosynthetic
machinery disrupted, respectively. In addition, both biosynthetic
operons were disrupted in a ybtS–iucA double mutant. We hy-
pothesized that if the vaccines specifically target Ybt or Aer during
infection, then infection with each siderophore biosynthesis mutant
would result in loss of protection by the corresponding vaccine.
Mice were vaccinated with either cBSA or cBSA–Ybt (SI Appendix,
Fig. S1C) and then transurethrally challenged with ybtS. After 48 h,
there were no significant differences in the bacterial burdens of ybtS
between cBSA- and cBSA–Ybt-vaccinated mice (Fig. 2A and SI
Appendix, Fig. S4A). Similar experiments were conducted by vac-
cinating mice with cBSA–Aer and then challenging with iucA, as
well as by covaccinating with 1:1 cBSA–Ybt:cBSA–Aer and then
challenging with ybtS–iucA (Fig. 2 B and C and SI Appendix, Fig. S4
B and C). In all instances, no significant differences were identified
between the vaccinated groups and the cBSA control mice (Fig. 2
and SI Appendix, Fig. S4), indicating that the vaccines elicit an
immune response specifically targeting Ybt and Aer during UTI.
The unexpected differences in kidney colonization for iucA and
ybtS–iucA mutants (Fig. 2 B and C) compared with the cBSA–Aer-
and 1:1 cBSA–Ybt:cBSA–Aer-vaccinated and infected with WT
HM69 (Fig. 1C) could be due to disparities between the effects of
genetically disrupting intracellular siderophore biosynthesis and
immunologically targeting extracellular siderophore activity. In the
case of iucA (Fig. 2B) and cBSA–Aer (Fig. 1C), it is possible that
the immune response does not inactivate Aer-mediated iron ac-
quisition as well as genetically disrupting Aer biosynthesis. Whereas in
the case of ybtS–iucA (Fig. 2C) and 1:1 cBSA–Ybt:cBSA–Aer (Fig.
1C), ybtS–iucA may colonize the kidneys better than WT in 1:1
cBSA–Ybt:cBSA–Aer-vaccinated mice because of increased virulence
or Ent production in ybtS–iucA. Studies have shown that disrupting
siderophore biosynthesis impacts central metabolism, which could

 affect the elaboration of other virulence factors and ultimately
pathogenesis (48). Alternatively, elevated Ent levels have been
detected in bacterial strains with mutations in the Aer and Ybt
pathways, which could improve pathogenesis (49, 50). Elevated Ent
levels in ybtS–iucA may also explain the surprising increase in kid-
ney colonization of cBSA-vaccinated mice infected with ybtS–iucA
compared with iucA (Fig. 2 B and C), as the iucA and ybtS–iucA
mutants have been rigorously confirmed to be genetically correct
and found to grow similarly in vitro (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Despite
these confounding factors presented by the use of isogenic side-
rophore biosynthesis mutants, the data presented in Fig. 2 reveal
that the bacteria must encode the targeted siderophore to be
susceptible to the corresponding cBSA–siderophore vaccine. This
emphasizes that the protection elicited by vaccination with Ybt and
Aer is target-specific, suggestive of an adaptive immune response.
Because the molecular masses of Ybt and Aer are relatively small
(481 Da and 564 Da, respectively), we hypothesized that Ybt and
Aer are unable to stimulate an immune response alone and are
acting as haptens. To test the immunogenicity of Ybt and Aer, mice
were vaccinated with Ybt, Aer, or a 1:1 mixture of Ybt:Aer. Based
on the theoretical maximum amount of siderophores administered
in the cBSA–conjugate vaccine, mice were immunized with 0.75 μg
of siderophore and boosted with 0.19 μg of siderophore on days 7
and 14 postimmunization (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C). On day 21
postimmunization, mice were challenged with 108 cfu of HM69
and bacterial burdens were quantified 48 h later. Without a carrier

Protection provided by siderophore vaccines requires the biosynthesis of bacterial stealth siderophores. CBA/J mice were vaccinated according to the protocol
but transurethrally inoculated with the corresponding siderophore biosynthesis mutant. (A) cBSA–Ybt-vaccinated mice were inoculated with HM69 ybtS, (B) cBSA–
Aer-vaccinated mice were inoculated with HM69 iucA, and (C) 1:1 cBSA–Ybt:cBSA–Aer-vaccinated mice were infected with HM69 ybtS–iucA. For each experiment,
cBSA was used as the negative control (dark gray bars). In all instances, mice were transurethrally inoculated with 108 cfus of the indicated strain. After 48 h, cfus in
the urine and kidneys were enumerated by serial dilution and plating on LB agar. Statistical analyses using a one-tailed Mann–Whitney test identified no significant
differences between negative control and siderophore-vaccinated groups (0.2336 < P < 0.4761). Limit of detection was 102 cfu/mL of urine or cfu/g of kidneys; bars

Vaccination with siderophores reduces bacterial burdens and inflammation in the urine and kidneys during UTI. CBA/J mice were vaccinated with cBSA,
cBSA–Ybt, cBSA–Aer, or 1:1 cBSA–Ybt:cBSA–Aer. At 21 d after the first immunization, mice were transurethrally inoculated with 108 cfus of wild-type HM69. After
48 h, cfus in the (A) urine, (B) bladder, and (C) kidneys were enumerated by serial dilution and plating on LB agar. Limit of detection was 102 cfu/mL of urine or

 protein, immunization with Ybt and Aer no longer protected against
UTI (Fig. 3 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig. S6A), revealing that Ybt
and Aer require cBSA to elicit a protective immune response.
To fully address whether the siderophores are acting as haptens,
we next vaccinated the mice with cBSA unconjugated to Ybt, Aer,
or a 1:1 mixture of Ybt:Aer. We hypothesized that if the side-
rophores are acting as haptens, then protection will be lost when the
mice are vaccinated with cBSA and unconjugated siderophore. The
mice were immunized with 0.75 μg of siderophore plus 10 μg of
cBSA on day 0 and boosted with 0.19 μg of siderophore plus 2.5 μg
of cBSA on days 7 and 14 postimmunization (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C).
On day 21 postimmunization, mice were transurethrally inoculated
with 108 cfu of HM69, and after 48 h, the bacterial burdens in the
urinary tract were quantified. In a small pilot experiment, bacterial
burdens were diminished in the urine and kidneys (Fig. 3 C and D
and SI Appendix, Fig. S6B) following the same trend as the conju-
gated vaccine (Fig. 1), indicating that the siderophores are not
acting as haptens and do not require conjugation to cBSA to protect
against pyelonephritis.
Because Ybt and Aer require cBSA as an immunogen to elicit a
protective immune response and bacterial production of the targeted
siderophore, we hypothesized that protection is mediated by the
adaptive immune system. Because the highly cationic surface charge
of cBSA interferes with analysis by ELISA (51), we examined this
notion using our murine model of ascending UTI. Mice were im-
munized once with 10 μg of cBSA, cBSA–Ybt, cBSA–Aer, or a 1:1
mixture of cBSA–Ybt:cBSA–Aer and then challenged transur-
ethrally with E. coli HM69 7 d postimmunization. Challenging
shortly after immunization precludes the development of an effective
adaptive immune response (52). After 48 h, the bacterial burdens in
the urinary tract were enumerated, and as predicted, no protection
was observed (Fig. 3 E and F and SI Appendix, Fig. S6C), suggesting
that protection is mediated by an adaptive immune response.
Discussion
These findings provide a significant conceptual advance in which
bacterial-derived small molecules have been successfully formu-
lated in a vaccine regimen that reduces both inflammation and the
bacterial burden in the kidneys and urine in a murine model of UTI
(Fig. 1). To protect against pyelonephritis, the bacteria used for
challenge must encode the targeted stealth siderophores (Fig. 2).
The siderophores do not need to be conjugated to the immunogen
to elicit protection, indicating that despite their small molecular
weights (481 Da and 564 Da), Ybt and Aer are large enough to
stimulate a protective immune response (Fig. 3 A–D). In addition,
successful vaccination with siderophores requires repeated co-
administration with the immunogen cBSA over the course of 3 wk
(Fig. 3 E and F). Altogether, these data suggest that the cBSA–
siderophore conjugates elicit an adaptive immune response that
specifically targets pathogens encoding stealth siderophores. We
propose that Aer and Ybt are suitable for inclusion in multicom-
ponent vaccines due to their amenable biochemical features,
specificity for pathogenic bacteria compared with commensal or-
ganisms, and synergistic protection in the kidneys.
We have been unable to confirm, however, that the protective
immune response is antibody-mediated, as we do not detect
siderophore-specific antibodies by direct or sandwich ELISAs or
ELISpot using the cBSA-conjugated siderophores as capture anti-
gens. Because cBSA interferes with ELISAs (51) and the side-
rophores are not suited for adsorption to ELISA plates, we have also
probed for anti-siderophore antibodies by direct and sandwich
ELISAs with Ybt and Aer conjugated to cholera toxin or BSA; nei-
ther revealed siderophore-specific antibodies. It is possible that these
carrier proteins are poorly haptenized or antisiderophore antibodies
do not recognize the siderophores in the context of these carrier
proteins. Despite our best efforts, we have been unable to identify
siderophore-specific antibodies, however the data presented here
suggest that the vaccine is specific (Fig. 2) and acts in a time frame

Protection requires repeated exposure to siderophore and an immunogen. The requirement of the cBSA carrier protein was examined by intranasally
administering the unconjugated apo-siderophores (A and B) in PBS and (C and D) with cBSA. (E and F) To determine if the vaccine requires time adequate for
generating an adaptive immune response, mice were vaccinated with 10 μg of cBSA, cBSA–Ybt, cBSA–Aer, or 1:1 cBSA–Ybt:cBSA–Aer and transurethrally
inoculated 1 wk after immunization. No booster doses were administered. In all experiments, mice were transurethrally inoculated with wild-type HM69.
After 48 h, cfus in the urine (A, C, and E) and kidneys (B, D, and F) were enumerated by serial dilution and plating on LB agar. Statistical analyses were
calculated using a one-tailed Mann–Whitney test. The range of unlabeled P values is 0.0627–0.4933. Limit of detection was 102 cfu/mL of urine or cfu/g of
kidneys; bars represent the median; and n ≥ 10.

 consistent with adaptive immunity (Fig. 3 E and F). It is possible that
siderophore-specific antibodies are either absent or present and ef-
fective but below the limit of detection. Nonetheless, the utility of
small molecules formulated for use as vaccine antigens is intriguing.
Previous publications describing the use of siderophores in vac-
cines against human pathogens primarily focus on eliciting an an-
tibody response and either did not observe protection against
infection or did not use an animal model to evaluate the effec-
tiveness of the vaccine. The first report describing the development
of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against a siderophore targeted
pseudobactin, the siderophore of the plant pathogen Pseudomonas
putida. These MAbs were primarily used for studying iron acqui-
sition in the plant pathogen and were not developed for therapeutic
applications (53). Shortly thereafter, another group elicited mouse
MAbs against ferric Aer (FeAer) and demonstrated that these
antibodies restricted E. coli growth in calf serum (54). These
FeAer-specific MAbs were useful for detecting Aer-producing
Enterobacteriaceae but did not provide protection in three tested
models of infection (55, 56). A lethal i.p. infection model with
E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was used to assess the protection
provided upon either passive or active immunization of Swiss mice
(55). In both cases, vaccination did not significantly improve the
survival of the mice despite the confirmed presence of anti-FeAer
antibodies. The same vaccine preparation was also used to assess
protection in a passive transovarian immunization chick model
challenged with E. coli, and despite the presence of Aer-specific
antibodies, the chicks succumbed to infection similar to the
unvaccinated controls (55). The last published study regarding
siderophore vaccine preparation successfully elicited vibriobactin-
specific antibodies in mice, but the protective effects of these an-
tibodies were never reported (57). Building upon these studies, we
have shown that vaccination with siderophores is protective in a
mouse model of ascending UTI. The success of the vaccine strategy
described here compared with previous publications using side-
rophore vaccines may be due to the intranasal immunization route
and an animal model that better recapitulates natural infection.
It has been documented that vaccination with outer-membrane
proteins up-regulated during iron limitation protects against E. coli
infections (43). Specifically, our laboratory investigated the immu-
noprotective properties of the outer-membrane protein receptors for
Ybt and Aer: namely, FyuA and IutA, respectively (20, 42). Im-
munization with FyuA resulted in a 1.5 log decrease in the bacterial
burden in the kidneys (urine counts were not reported), and im-
munization with IutA reduced bacterial burden in the urine, blad-
ders, and kidneys by 1.3, 1.0, and 0.9 logs, respectively. Studies
reported here recapitulate these findings with the exception of the
protection observed in the bladder with the IutA vaccine. In our
extensive experience with developing UTI vaccines, we have found
that protection in the bladder is more difficult to achieve in our
murine model than protection in the kidneys, likely due to low
levels of antigen-specific antibody detected in the bladder (20, 42).
This may be due to technical issues implicit in a murine model of
UTI or the lower abundance of antibodies in the urine compared
with the sera (20, 58–60). Alternatively, the lack of protection in the
bladder in response to targeting Aer-mediated iron acquisition
could be due to the different immune response elicited by vacci-
nation with the low-molecular mass siderophores compared with
the proteinaceous receptors.
Building upon these prior studies, we now show that vaccination
with siderophores protects against pyelonephritis in a mouse model
of ascending UTI and circumvents the biochemical challenges as-
sociated with using outer-membrane proteins as antigens (Fig. 1).
Moreover, Aer and Ybt may be suitable for a multicomponent
vaccine due to their amenable biochemical features, specificity for
pathogenic bacteria over commensal organisms, and synergistic
protection in the kidneys. The practical utility of cBSA as an im-
munogen in human vaccines remains to be evaluated in future
studies. Combining Aer and Ybt with other protective antigens such
as adhesins, toxins, and other iron receptors may prove to be a
successful vaccination strategy (19). Adding Aer and Ybt to such
multicomponent vaccine preparations should prove simple due
to their amenable biochemical properties and their ability to
elicit protection without being conjugated to a carrier protein
(Fig. 3D). Notably, highly evolved iron acquisition strategies,
including Aer and Ybt, are critical virulence factors for ExPEC
and other pathogenic species within the Enterobacteriaceae (61,
62). Therefore, by defining the protective efficacy of two stealth
siderophores prevalent among pathogenic E. coli (39), we have
determined that Ybt and Aer are valuable antigens that have not
heretofore been included in any UTI vaccines and, more gen-
erally, exemplify the untapped resource of bacteria-specific small
molecules as potential vaccine antigens.
Online Methods
Descriptions of the bacterial strains, culture methods, and recombineering; cBSA–
siderophore conjugation; tandem mass spectrometry; and histologic scoring are
in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods.
Vaccination Procedures. All mouse studies were conducted in accordance with
protocol 00005052 approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
at the University of Michigan. This protocol is in compliance with the National
Institutes of Health guidelines for the humane use and care of laboratory animals.
Vaccination was performed as previously described (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C)
(20). All vaccine doses were prepared in advance from 2 mg/mL stocks. Ali-
quots were flash-frozen and stored at –80 °C until the time of vaccination.
Briefly, 6–7-wk-old CBA/J mice were intranasally immunized with 20 μL of
vaccine conjugate (10 μL/nare). On day 0, the mice received 10 μg of the
appropriate vaccine conjugate (0.5 mg/mL in PBS, pH 7.4). On days 7 and 14,
mice were boosted with 2.5 μg of vaccine conjugate (0.125 mg/mL in PBS,
pH 7.4). Mice were challenged, as described below, on day 21.
One exception to this protocol was for vaccinations that used unconjugated
siderophores. When PBS pH 7.4 or unconjugated cBSA was used as controls, mice
were immunized with 0.75 μg siderophore (37.5 μg/mL in PBS pH 7.4) and
boosted with 0.19 μg of siderophore (9.4 μg/mL in PBS pH 7.4). The amounts of
siderophores used were calculated based on the maximum amount of side-
rophore the mice could potentially receive from the cBSA–vaccine conjugates.
A second exception to the above protocol was when mice were transurethrally
challenged 1 wk after the initial immunization. No boosters were given to
assess the requirement for adaptive responses to elicit protection.
Murine Model of Ascending UTI. A previously described murine model of as-
cending UTI was used to assess vaccine efficacy (20, 58). Unless noted otherwise,
female CBA/J mice were transurethrally challenged with 50 μL of 4 × 109 cfu/mL
of E. coli HM69 resuspended in PBS, resulting in an inoculum of 108 cfu per
mouse. The inoculum was delivered using a sterile 0.28-mm inner-diameter
polyethylene catheter connected to an infusion pump (Harvard Apparatus) over
a period of 20 s. Infection progressed for 48 h, after which bacterial burdens in
urine as well as bladder and kidney homogenates were enumerated. Tissues
were homogenized in PBS with a GLH homogenizer (Omni International) and
plated on LB agar using an Autoplate 4000 spiral plater (Spiral Biotech). A
QCount automated plate counter (Spiral Biotech) was used to enumerate col-
ony counts on the plates.
Statistical Analysis. Unpaired, nonparametric analysis was performed using the
Mann–Whitney test calculated in GraphPad Prism 6.01 for Windows. Results
were considered significant if the P value was less than or equal to 0.05.
