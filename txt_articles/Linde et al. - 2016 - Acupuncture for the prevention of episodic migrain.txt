Background
Acupuncture is often used for migraine prevention but its effectiveness is still controversial. We present an update of our Cochrane
review from 2009.
Objectives
To investigate whether acupuncture is a) more effective than no prophylactic treatment/routine care only; b) more effective than sham
(placebo) acupuncture; and c) as effective as prophylactic treatment with drugs in reducing headache frequency in adults with episodic
migraine.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL: 2016, issue 1); MEDLINE (via Ovid, 2008 to January
2016); Ovid EMBASE (2008 to January 2016); and Ovid AMED (1985 to January 2016). We checked PubMed for recent publications
to April 2016. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Registry Platform to February 2016 for ongoing
and unpublished trials.
Selection criteria
We included randomized trials at least eight weeks in duration that compared an acupuncture intervention with a no-acupuncture
control (no prophylactic treatment or routine care only), a sham-acupuncture intervention, or prophylactic drug in participants with
episodic migraine.
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers checked eligibility; extracted information on participants, interventions, methods and results, and assessed risk of bias and
quality of the acupuncture intervention. The primary outcome was migraine frequency (preferably migraine days, attacks or headache
days if migraine days not measured/reported) after treatment and at follow-up. The secondary outcome was response (at least 50%

 frequency reduction). Safety outcomes were number of participants dropping out due to adverse effects and number of participants
reporting at least one adverse effect. We calculated pooled effect size estimates using a fixed-effect model. We assessed the evidence
using GRADE and created ’Summary of findings’ tables.
Main results
Twenty-two trials including 4985 participants in total (median 71, range 30 to 1715) met our updated selection criteria. We excluded
five previously included trials from this update because they included people who had had migraine for less than 12 months, and
included five new trials. Five trials had a no-acupuncture control group (either treatment of attacks only or non-regulated routine care),
15 a sham-acupuncture control group, and five a comparator group receiving prophylactic drug treatment. In comparisons with no-
acupuncture control groups and groups receiving prophylactic drug treatment, there was risk of performance and detection bias as
blinding was not possible. Overall the quality of the evidence was moderate.
Comparison with no acupuncture
Acupuncture was associated with a moderate reduction of headache frequency over no acupuncture after treatment (four trials, 2199
participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.56; 95% CI -0.65 to -0.48); findings were statistically heterogeneous (I² = 57%;
moderate quality evidence). After treatment headache frequency at least halved in 41% of participants receiving acupuncture and 17%
receiving no acupuncture (pooled risk ratio (RR) 2.40; 95% CI 2.08 to 2.76; 4 studies, 2519 participants) with a corresponding number
needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 6); there was no indication of statistical heterogeneity
(I² = 7%; moderate quality evidence). The only trial with post-treatment follow-up found a small but significant benefit 12 months
after randomisation (RR 2.16; 95% CI 1.35 to 3.45; NNT 7; 95% 4 to 25; 377 participants, low quality evidence).
Comparison with sham acupuncture
Both after treatment (12 trials, 1646 participants) and at follow-up (10 trials, 1534 participants), acupuncture was associated with a
small but statistically significant frequency reduction over sham (moderate quality evidence). The SMD was -0.18 (95% CI -0.28 to
-0.08; I² = 47%) after treatment and -0.19 (95% CI -0.30 to -0.09; I² = 59%) at follow-up. After treatment headache frequency at
least halved in 50% of participants receiving true acupuncture and 41% receiving sham acupuncture (pooled RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11
to 1.36; I² = 48%; 14 trials, 1825 participants) and at follow-up in 53% and 42%, respectively (pooled RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13 to
1.39; I² = 61%; 11 trials, 1683 participants; moderate quality evidence). The corresponding NNTBs are 11 (95% CI 7.00 to 20.00)
and 10 (95% CI 6.00 to 18.00), respectively. The number of participants dropping out due to adverse effects (odds ratio (OR) 2.84;
95% CI 0.43 to 18.71; 7 trials, 931 participants; low quality evidence) and the number of participants reporting adverse effects (OR
1.15; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.56; 4 trials, 1414 participants; moderate quality evidence) did not differ significantly between acupuncture
and sham groups.
Comparison with prophylactic drug treatment
Acupuncture reduced migraine frequency significantly more than drug prophylaxis after treatment ( SMD -0.25; 95% CI -0.39 to -
0.10; 3 trials, 739 participants), but the significance was not maintained at follow-up (SMD -0.13; 95% CI -0.28 to 0.01; 3 trials,
744 participants; moderate quality evidence). After three months headache frequency at least halved in 57% of participants receiving
acupuncture and 46% receiving prophylactic drugs (pooled RR 1.24; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44) and after six months in 59% and 54%,
respectively (pooled RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.26; moderate quality evidence). Findings were consistent among trials with I² being
0% in all analyses. Trial participants receiving acupuncture were less likely to drop out due to adverse effects (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.08 to
0.86; 4 trials, 451 participants) and to report adverse effects (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.62; 5 trials 931 participants) than participants
receiving prophylactic drugs (moderate quality evidence).
Authors’ conclusions
The available evidence suggests that adding acupuncture to symptomatic treatment of attacks reduces the frequency of headaches.
Contrary to the previous findings, the updated evidence also suggests that there is an effect over sham, but this effect is small. The
available trials also suggest that acupuncture may be at least similarly effective as treatment with prophylactic drugs. Acupuncture can
be considered a treatment option for patients willing to undergo this treatment. As for other migraine treatments, long-term studies,
more than one year in duration, are lacking.

 Acupuncture for preventing migraine attacks
Bottom line
The available evidence suggests that a course of acupuncture consisting of at least six treatment sessions can be a valuable option for
people with migraine.
Background
Individuals with migraine have repeated attacks of severe headache, usually just on one side and often with vomiting. Acupuncture is a
therapy in which thin needles are inserted into the skin at particular points. It originated in China, and is now used in many countries to
treat people with migraine. We evaluated whether acupuncture reduces the number of episodes of migraine. We looked at the number
of people in whom the number of migraine days per month was reduced by half or more than half.
Key results
For this update, we reviewed 22 trials with 4985 people, published up to January 2016. We omitted five trials from the original review
because they included people who had had migraine for less than 12 months. We included five new trials in this update.
In four trials, acupuncture added to usual care or treatment of migraine on onset only (usually with pain-killers) resulted in 41 in 100
people having the frequency of headaches at least halved, compared to 17 of 100 people given usual care only.
In 15 trials, acupuncture was compared with ’fake’ acupuncture, where needles are inserted at incorrect points or do not penetrate the
skin. The frequency of headaches halved in 50 of 100 people receiving true acupuncture, compared with 41 of 100 people receiving
’fake’ acupuncture. The results were dominated by three good quality large trials (with about 1200 people) showing that the effect of
true acupuncture was still present after six months. There were no differences in the number of side effects of real and ’fake’ acupuncture,
or the numbers dropping out because of side effects.
In five trials, acupuncture was compared to a drug proven to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks, but only three trials provided
useful information. At three months, headache frequency halved in 57 of 100 people receiving acupuncture, compared with 46 of 100
people taking the drug. After six months, headache frequency halved in 59 of 100 people receiving acupuncture, compared with 54
of 100 people taking the drug. People receiving acupuncture reported side effects less often than people receiving drugs, and were less
likely to drop out of the trial.
Our findings about the number of days with migraine per month can be summarized as follows. If people have six days with migraine
per month on average before starting treatment, this would be reduced to five days in people receiving only usual care, to four days in
those receiving fake acupuncture or a prophylactic drug, and to three and a half days in those receiving true acupuncture.
Quality of the evidence
Overall the quality of the evidence was moderate.

 B A C K G R O U N D
This review is an update of a previously published review in The
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [Issue 1, 2009] on
acupuncture for migraine (Linde 2009).
Description of the condition
Migraine is a disorder with recurrent headaches manifesting in at-
tacks lasting from four to 72 hours. Typical characteristics of the
headache are unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or
severe intensity, aggravation by routine physical activity and asso-
ciation with nausea, photophobia or phonophobia, or any combi-
nation of all three (IHS 2013). Epidemiological studies have con-
sistently shown that migraine is a common disorder with a one-
year prevalence of around 10% to 12% and a lifetime prevalence
of between 15% and 20% (Oleson 2007). In Europe, the eco-
nomic cost of migraine is estimated at EUR 27 billion per year
(Andlin-Sobocki 2005). Migraine is subclassified into the more
frequent episodic migraine (fewer than 15 days with migrain-
ous headaches per month) and the less frequent chronic migraine
(more than 15 days per month). Most people with migraine can
be adequately managed by treatingof acute headaches alone, but a
relevant minority need prophylactic interventions, as their attacks
are either very frequent or are insufficiently controlled by acute
therapy. Several drugs, such as propranolol, metoprolol, flunar-
izine, valproic acid and topiramate, have been shown to reduce
attack frequency in some people (Dodick 2007; Linde M 2013a;
Linde M 2013b), however, all these drugs are associated with ad-
verse effects. Dropout rates in most clinical trials are high, sug-
gesting that the drugs are not well accepted by patients. There is
some evidence that behavioural interventions such as relaxation or
biofeedback are beneficial (Holroyd 1990; Nestoriuc 2007), but
additional effective, low-risk treatments are clearly desirable.
Description of the intervention
Acupuncture in the context of this review is defined as the needling
of specific points of the body. It is one of the most widely used
complementary therapies in many countries (Bodeker 2005). For
example, according to a population-based survey in 2002 in the
United States of America (USA), 4.1% of respondents reported
lifetime use of acupuncture, and 1.1% reported recent use (Burke
2006). A similar survey in Germany performed in the same year
found that 8.7% of adults between 18 and 69 years of age had re-
ceived acupuncture treatment in the previous 12 months (Härtel
2004). Acupuncture was originally developed as part of Chinese
medicine wherein the purpose of treatment was to bring the pa-
tient back to the state of equilibrium postulated to exist prior to
illness (Endres 2007). Some acupuncture practitioners have dis-
pensed with these concepts and understand acupuncture in terms
of conventional neurophysiology. Acupuncture is often used to
treat headache, especially migraine. For example, 9.9% of the
acupuncture users in the US survey mentioned above stated that
they had been treated for migraine or other headaches (Burke
2006).
How the intervention might work
Many studies have shown that acupuncture has short-term effects
on a variety of physiological variables relevant to analgesia (Bäcker
2004; Endres 2007). However, it is unclear to what extent these
observations from experimental settings are relevant to the long-
term effects reported by practitioners. It is assumed that a variable
combination of local effects; spinal and supraspinal mechanisms;
and cortical, psychological or ’placebo’ mechanisms contribute to
the clinical effects in routine care (Carlsson 2002). While there is
little doubt that acupuncture interventions cause neurophysiolog-
ical changes in the organism, the traditional concepts of acupunc-
ture involving specifically located points on a system of ’channels’
called meridians are controversial (Kaptchuk 2002). As for many
non-pharmacological interventions, it is difficult to create sham
interventions for acupuncture which are both indistinguishable
and physiologically inert. This is due both to technical reasons
and the unclear mechanism of action. Consequently, trials using
sham acupuncture controls must be interpreted carefully, as sham
treatments might not be inactive placebos, while trials comparing
acupuncture with no prophylactic treatment, prophylactic drugs
or other interventions must also be interpreted carefully, as they
have a higher risk of bias due to lack of blinding.
Why it is important to do this review
Despite acupuncture’s widespread use its effectiveness is still dis-
cussed controversially (Da Silva 2015, McGeeney 2015). Since the
publication of the previous version of our Cochrane review (Linde
2009) a number of new trials have been published. Therefore, an
update of the review was necessary. To sharpen the focus of our
review we narrowed our selection criteria. In particular, we now
focus on episodic migraine.
O B J E C T I V E S
To investigate whether acupuncture is a) more effective than no
prophylactic treatment/routine care only; b) more effective than
’sham’ (placebo) acupuncture; and c) as effective as prophylactic
treatment with drugs in reducing headache frequency in patients
with episodic migraine.

 Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included controlled trials investigating the prophylactic effect
of acupuncture in which allocation to treatment was explicitly
randomized, and in which participants were followed up for at
least eight weeks after randomisation. We excluded trials in which
a clearly inappropriate method of randomisation was used, for
example, open alternation.
Types of participants
We included trials in which study participants had been diagnosed
with episodic migraine (the word episodic did not have to be men-
tioned in the report explicitly; see exclusion criteria below to ex-
clude trials focusing on chronic migraine). Studies focusing on
migraine but including participants with additional tension-type
headache were included. We included studies including partici-
pants with headaches of various types (for example, some partic-
ipants with migraine, some with tension-type headache) only if
findings for participants with migraine were available separately,
or if more than 90% of participants suffered from migraine.
The duration of the condition had to be longer than one year in
the great majority (more than 80%) of participants. This criterion
was considered met if:
• duration for longer than year was an inclusion criterion; or
• the mean duration minus one standard deviation was more
than one year; or
• the mean duration (standard deviation not reported) was
more than 10 years; or
• other information was presented that made it highly likely
that the criterion was met (e.g. study authors presented
proportions with duration ranges).
We excluded trials in patients with chronic migraine, chronic daily
headache or in which at baseline more than half of participants had
more than 15 days with migrainous headache per month. We also
excluded trials in which there was no information of the duration
of headache complaints.
Changes to previous version
In this update of the review we have excluded trials focusing on
chronic migraine, as the definition of chronic migraine is still
debated and the separation from other diagnoses, for example
headache due to medication overuse, is difficult (in the previous
version of this review (Linde 2009) we were not aware of any trials
on chronic migraine and they were not explicitly excluded). In the
current update we have also excluded trials in which a relevant
proportion of participants had been suffering from migraine for
less than one year or in which duration was unclear.
Types of interventions
Experimental interventions
• Any treatment involving needle insertion (with or without
manual or electrical stimulation) at acupuncture points, pain
points or trigger points, described as acupuncture. The planned
treatment course must have had at least six treatment sessions,
and been given at least once per week. Trials with individualised
strategies were included if the median or mean number of
treatments was at least six sessions, and there was no reason to
believe that treatments were given less frequently than once per
week in the majority of participants.
• We excluded studies that:
◦ exclusively investigated acupuncture at specific ‘micro-
systems’ (e.g. scalp or ear acupuncture), although we included
trials using micro-system points in addition to body acupuncture;
◦ investigated other methods of stimulating acupuncture
points without needle insertion, for example, acupressure, laser
stimulation or transcutaneous electrical stimulation;
◦ injected fluids at acupuncture or trigger points.
Control interventions
• No treatment other than treatment of acute migraine
attacks or routine care (which typically includes treatment of
acute attacks, but might also include other treatments; however,
trials normally require that no new experimental or standardized
treatment be initiated during the trial period).
• Sham interventions (interventions mimicking ’true’
acupuncture/true treatment, but deviating in at least one aspect
considered important by acupuncture theory, such as skin
penetration or correct point location).
• Prophylactic pharmacological treatment (for example, β-
blocking agents, calcium channel antagonists, anti-epileptic
drugs) given for at least eight weeks.
• We excluded trials comparing acupuncture to food
supplements, herbal drugs or combinations of herbal drugs, and
trials that only compared different forms of acupuncture.
Changes to previous version
In the previous version of the review (Linde 2009) we included
trials using any prophylactic treatment other than acupuncture as
comparison. With a slowly increasing number of trials using a wide
range of different treatments (mainly various herbal medicines)
we decided to concentrate on conventional prophylactic pharma-
cological treatment to keep the review focused. We have defined
a minimum number and frequency of acupuncture treatment ses-
sions to ensure that treatments meet basic quality criteria.

 Types of outcome measures
We included studies if they measured at least one of the following
outcome measures for at least eight weeks after randomisation:
• headache frequency (attacks, days, hours, headache-free
days) per defined time period;
• response (≥ 50% frequency reduction documented in a
headache diary);
• disability or quality of life with a validated measure.
We excluded trials that:
• focussed on the treatment and measurement of acute
attacks;
• reported only measures such as “total effectiveness rate”
(e.g. proportion of participants healed, much improved,
improved, unchanged);
• reported only physiological or laboratory parameters;
• had outcome measurement periods of less than eight weeks
(from randomisation to final observation).
Changes to previous version
We have defined outcome measures more precisely to ensure that
measurement methods meet current standards of migraine re-
search.
Primary outcomes
The primary efficacy outcome of our systematic review was
headache frequency at completion of treatment and at follow-up.
The primary safety/acceptability outcomes were the number of
participants dropping out due to adverse effects and the number
of participants reporting at least one adverse event or effect (see
Measures of treatment effect for details).
Secondary outcomes
The secondary efficacy outcome of our systematic review was the
proportion of ’responders’ at completion of treatment and at fol-
low-up.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
For this update we searched the following databases without lan-
guage restrictions (date of the last search 20 January 2016):
• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 1), searched from
2008 to 2016;
• MEDLINE (via Ovid) 2008 to week 1 of January 2016;
• EMBASE (via Ovid) 2008 to 19 January 2016;
• AMED (via OVID) 1985 to January 2016.
The search strategies are reported in Appendix 1. In addition,
the first author checked PubMed monthly for new publications,
screening all hits for ’acupuncture AND (headache OR migraine)’
(last search 12 April 2016). For previous versions of this review
(Melchart2001; Linde 2009)we hadsearchedthe Cochrane Com-
plementary Medicine Field Trials Register (whose results are now
included in CENTRAL without relevant delay) and the Cochrane
Pain, Palliative & Supportive Care Trials Register (no longer up-
dated).
Searching other resources
We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) Interna-
tional Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; apps.who.int/
trialsearch/) and ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov) for com-
pleted or ongoing trials using the search string ’acupuncture AND
(headache OR migraine)’. The last search was on February 10,
2016. We also searched the reference lists of all eligible studies for
additional studies.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors screened all abstracts identified by the updated
search and excluded those that were clearly irrelevant (for example,
studies focusing on other conditions, reviews, etc.). We obtained
full texts of all remaining references and, again, screened them
to exclude clearly irrelevant papers. At least two review authors
formally checked all remaining articles and all trials included in
the previous version of our review (Linde 2009) for eligibility
according to the above-mentioned selection criteria. We resolved
any disagreements by discussion.
Data extraction and management
At least two review authors independently extracted information
on participants, methods, interventions, outcomes and results us-
ing a specially designed form before entry into Review Manager
(RevMan) (RevMan 2014). In particular, we extracted exact di-
agnoses; headache classifications used; number and type of cen-
tres; age; sex; duration of disease; number of participants random-
ized, treated and analysed; number of, and reasons for dropouts;
duration of baseline, treatment and follow-up periods; details of
acupuncture treatments (such as selection of points; number, fre-
quency and duration of sessions; achievement of de-chi (an irra-
diating feeling considered to indicate effective needling); number,
training and experience of acupuncturists); and details of control
interventions (sham technique, type and dosage of drugs). For de-
tails regarding methodological issues and study results, see below.
Where necessary, we sought additional information from the first
or corresponding authors of the included studies.

Acupuncture for the prevention of episodic migraine (Review)

 For six trials (Diener 2006; Jena 2008; Li 2012; Linde K 2005;
Streng 2006; Vickers 2004) included in the individual patient
database of the Acupuncture Trialists’ Collaboration (ATC), an
international collaborative network for high quality randomized
trials of acupuncture for chronic pain (see Vickers 2010; Vickers
2012), we obtained uniformly re-analysed summary data for nu-
meric variables and the number of responders for calculation of
effect sizes. We used these data to ensure that we obtained the most
precise estimate of treatment effect. For each trial, we created an
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model for each numeric out-
come at each time point and adjusted for the baseline value of that
outcome, treatment group (acupuncture or control), and any vari-
ables that were used to stratify randomisation in the original trial.
Using this model, we calculated the adjusted mean outcome values
for each group (acupuncture and control), and we used the stan-
dard error for the effect of treatment from the ANCOVA model
to calculate the standard deviation for the difference in adjusted
means. Therefore, effect sizes calculated in our analyses might to
some degree deviate from those in the original publications of the
six trials. Use of raw data also allowed us to calculate response
rates, such as for a 50% reduction in pain, even if this was not
reported in the original trial publication.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
For the assessment of study quality, the risk of bias approach for
Cochrane reviews was used (Higgins 2011). We used the following
six separate criteria:
• adequate sequence generation;
• allocation concealment;
• blinding;
• incomplete outcome data addressed (up to three months
after randomisation);
• incomplete follow-up outcome data addressed (four to 12
months after randomisation);
• free of selective reporting.
We did not include the item ’other potential threats to validity’ in
a formal manner, but noted if relevant flaws were detected.
In a first step, we copied information relevant to making a judg-
ment on a criterion from the original publication into an assess-
ment table. We entered any additional information from the study
authors into the table, if it was available, , along with an indica-
tion that this was unpublished information. At least two reviewers
independently made a judgment on whether the risk of bias for
each criterion was considered low, high or unclear. We resolved
any disagreements by discussion.
For the first five criteria (above), we followed the recommenda-
tions of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interven-
tions (Higgins 2011). For ’selective reporting’, we decided to use a
more liberal definition. Headache trials typically measure a multi-
plicity of headache outcomes at several time points using diaries,
and there is a plethora of slightly different outcome measurement
methods. While a single primary endpoint is sometimes prede-
fined, the overall pattern of a variety of outcomes is necessary to
get a clinically interpretable picture. If we had applied the strict
guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of In-
terventions, almost all trials would have been rated ’unclear’ for
’selective reporting’. We considered trials as having a low risk of
bias for selective reporting if they reported the results of the most
relevant headache outcomes assessed (typically a frequency mea-
sure, intensity, analgesic use and response) for the most relevant
time points (end of treatment and, if done, follow-up), and if the
outcomes and time points reported made it unlikely that study
investigators had picked them out because they were particularly
favourable or unfavourable.
If trials had both blinded sham control groups and unblinded
comparison groups receiving no prophylactic treatment or drug
treatment, in the risk of bias tables, the ’Judgement’ column al-
ways relates to the comparison with sham interventions. In the
’Description’ column, we included the assessment for the other
comparison group(s). As the risk of bias table does not include a
’not applicable’ option, we rated the item ’incomplete follow-up
outcome data addressed (four to 12 months after randomisation)?
’ as ’unclear’ for trials that did not follow participants longer than
three months.
We also assessed the adequacy of concealment of allocation ac-
cording to the criteria of the ATC (Vickers 2010) which are stricter
than those in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of In-
terventions. In particular, in the case of envelope randomisation,
investigators must have established and described detailed pro-
cedures to ensure that allocation could neither be predicted nor
changed post hoc. For example, there should have been procedures
to prevent investigators resealing and reusing an envelope after
it had been opened (e.g. envelopes were held by an independent
party). As the level of information needed for this assessment was
often not available in publications, we contacted study authors for
clarification. If information was not available, we did not consider
adequacy of concealment to be “unambiguously adequate”.
Assessment of the adequacy of the acupuncture intervention
We also attempted to provide a crude estimate of the quality of
acupuncture. Atleasttworeviewerswhoare trainedinacupuncture
and have several years of practical experience (GA, BB, YF, AW)
answered two questions. First, they were asked how they would
treat the participants included in the study. Answer options were
’exactly or almost exactly the same way’, ’similarly’, ’differently’,
’completely differently’ or ’could not assess’ due to insufficient in-
formation (on acupuncture or on the participants). Second, they
were asked to rate their degree of confidence that acupuncture was
applied in an appropriate manner on a 100-mm visual scale (with
0% = complete absence of evidence that the acupuncture was ap-
propriate, and 100% = total certainty that the acupuncture was ap-
propriate). A member of the review team (AW) proposed the latter
method , which was used in a systematic review of clinical trials
9

 of acupuncture for back pain (Ernst 1998). In the Characteristics
of included studies table, the acupuncturists’ assessments are sum-
marized under ’Methods’ (for example, “similarly/70%” indicates
a trial where the acupuncturist-reviewer would treat ’similarly’ and
is ’70%’ confident that acupuncture was applied appropriately).
Measures of treatment effect
Main analysis
Our primary efficacy outcome was headache frequency at comple-
tion of treatment and at follow-up (closest to six months after ran-
domisation). As studies may report either attacks, migraine days
or headache days as a measure of headache frequency, we used a
system where various frequency measures could be used. As avail-
able, we used (in descending order of preference) absolute values
from four-week periods or other periods for (again, in descending
order of preference) migraine days, migraine attacks or headache
days. Due to the variability of outcomes, standardized mean dif-
ferences (SMD) were calculated as effect size measures. Negative
values indicate better outcomes in the acupuncture group.
Our secondary efficacy outcome was the proportion of ’respon-
ders’ at completion of treatment and at follow-up (closest to six
months after randomisation). Response was defined as a reduc-
tion in migraine days of at least 50% compared to baseline. If
the number of responders regarding migraine days was not avail-
able we used at least 50% reduction in number of migraine at-
tacks (second preference), or at least 50% reduction in number of
headache days (third preference). We calculated risk ratios (RR) of
having a response and 95% confidence intervals (CI) as effect size
measures. Risk ratios greater than 1 indicate that there were more
responders in the acupuncture group compared to the compara-
tor group. When reporting results on response in this review (in
the abstract, the plain language summary, the results section and
the ’Summary of findings’ tables) these are based on the observed
proportion (sum of participants with response divided by the sum
of participants randomized) in the control group and the expected
proportion based on the pooled risk ratio from meta-analysis.
As primary safety/acceptability outcomes we used the number of
participants dropping out due to adverse effects and the number
of participants reporting at least one adverse event or effect. Fur-
ther safety/acceptability outcomes were the number of participants
not reaching the primary endpoint (we originally had planned to
extract the number of participants dropping out but this proved
difficult due to multiple measurement time points and reporting
issues) and the number of participants with serious adverse events.
As the number of events was typically low we calculated odds ra-
tios (OR) instead of risk ratios. Odds ratios greater than 1 indicate
more events (e.g. dropouts) in the acupuncture group.
Time window analysis
In the previous version of this review (Linde 2009) we analysed
findings according to the four time windows described below. This
had the advantage that measurement times used were similar across
trials. However, it had two disadvantages. Firstly, duration of treat-
ment periods was quite variable, so while in some trials treatment
was already completed (e.g. at 8 weeks) it was still ongoing (e.g.
until week 16) in others; secondly, four time windows for each
outcome made the ’Summary of findings’ tables very complex.
Therefore, in this update we have reported the time window anal-
yses as additional analyses only.
We used the following time windows:
• up to eight weeks/two months after randomisation;
• three to four months after randomisation;
• five to six months after randomisation; and
• more than six months after randomisation.
If more than one data point was available for a given time window,
we used: for the first time window, preferably data closest to eight
weeks; for the second window, data closest to the four weeks after
completion of treatment (for example, if treatment lasted eight
weeks, data for weeks nine to 12); for the third window, data
closest to six months; and for the fourth window, data closest to
12 months.
The following outcomes were used in the time windows analysis.
• Frequency of migraine attacks (means and standard
deviations) per four-week period. Mean differences were
calculated as effect size measures
• Response (risk ratio of having a response).
• Number of migraine days (means and standard deviations)
per four-week period (mean differences).
• Number of headache days (means and standard deviations)
per four-week period (mean differences).
• Headache intensity (any measures available, extraction of
means and standard deviations, calculation of SMDs).
• Frequency of analgesic use (any continuous or rank
measures available, extraction of means and standard deviations,
calculation of SMDs).
• Headache scores (SMDs)
All these outcomes rely on participant reports, mainly collected in
headache diaries.
Unit of analysis issues
The unit of analysis was the individual participant.
Dealing with missing data
If publications reported study findings with insufficient detail or
in an inconsistent manner we attempted to obtain further infor-
mation from the study authors.
Regarding missing participant data due to dropout or loss to fol-
low-up in the included studies we used the following strategies.
10

 • Efficacy outcomes:
◦ for comparisons of acupuncture with no acupuncture
and sham we used for continuous measures, if available, the data
from intention-to-treat analyses with missing values replaced;
otherwise, we used the presented data on available cases;
◦ for response we used the number of responders divided
by the number of participants randomized to the respective
group (counting missing information as non-response). In
studies comparing acupuncture with drug treatment, we used as
first preference analyses of participants having at least started
treatment as first preference, available cases as second preference
and intention-to-treat analyses as third preference.
• Safety outcomes:
◦ for all comparisons we used the number of participants
randomized as denominator for the outcomes number of
participants dropping out due to adverse effects, not reaching the
primary endpoint and experiencing serious adverse events;
◦ for the outcome number of participants reporting
adverse effects we used the number of participants having
received at least one treatment as denominator.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed heterogeneity with the Chi² test (Deeks 2011) and
the I² statistic (Higgins 2003).
Assessment of reporting biases
In forest plots studies are ordered according to their weight in
meta-analysis. The weight depends on the standard errors of the
point estimate (precision) which is dependent on sample size and
variability/frequency of events. This gives readers a crude impres-
sion whether more and less precise trials yield similar findings.
Data synthesis
For the purposes of summarizing results, we categorized the in-
cluded trials according to control groups:
• comparisons with no acupuncture (acute treatment only or
routine care);
• comparisons with sham acupuncture interventions;
• comparisons with prophylactic drug treatment.
If a trial included more than one acupuncture group, we pooled
results of the groups so that participants in the control group were
counted more than once.
We calculated pooled fixed-effect estimates, their 95% confidence
intervals, the Chi2 test for heterogeneity and the I2 statistic. If
the P value of the Chi² test for heterogeneity was less than 0.2
or I² greater than 40%, or both, we also reported random-effects
estimates.
Change to previous version
Based on the recommendation of the statistician in our team (AV)
we have used fixed-effect models for calculating pooled estimates
in this updated review. This is primarily because the fixed-effect
analysis constitutes a valid test of the null hypothesis. Moreover,
due to very large discrepancies in sample size, a random-effects
model would have resulted in participants in small studies being
given greater weight that participants in large studies. . Nonethe-
less, if the P value of the Chi² test for heterogeneity was less than
0.2 or I² was greater than 40%, or both, we have also reported
random-effect estimates.
We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence
related to each of the key outcomes as appropriate (GRADEpro
GDT 2015; Schünemann 2011). GRADE Working Group grades
of evidence are:
• High quality: we are very confident that the true effect lies
close to that of the estimate of the effect.
• Moderate quality: we are moderately confident in the effect
estimate, the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the
effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
• Low quality: our confidence in the effect estimate is
limited, the true effect may be substantially different from the
estimate of the effect.
• Very low quality: we have very little confidence in the effect
estimate, the true effect is likely to be substantially different from
the estimate of effect.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
To investigate potential sources of heterogeneity and the robust-
ness of our findings we performed subgroup analyses for the pri-
mary outcome, headache frequency, and for the secondary out-
come, response, both after treatment and at follow-up for the com-
parison vs. sham (the number of trials being too small for the other
two comparisons) for four variables. These variables were selected
after reviewing the trials qualitatively but before running analyses:
unambiguously adequate randomisation vs. other; larger (sample
size above median of the trials included in the analysis) vs. smaller
trials; number of treatment sessions up to 12 vs. 16 and more; and
sham penetrating the skin vs. non-penetrating sham.

cations and four entries in clinical trial registries that were deemed
potentially eligible were formally checked against the eligibility
criteria (see Figure 1). As we had modified selection criteria for this
update, we reassessed the 22 trials included in the previous ver-

(Facco 2013; Li 2012; Wallasch 2012; Wang 2015; Zhao 2014),
while five trials included in the previous version or our review had
to be excluded (Baust 1978; Doerr-Proske 1985; Dowson 1985;

Included studies
General characteristics
Twenty-two trials including 4985 participants in total (median 71,
range 30 to 1715) met our selection criteria; 18 studies were two-
armed, two were three-armed and a further two were four-armed
(see Characteristics of included studies). All trials used parallel-
group designs; there were no cross-over studies. Fifteen trials in-
cluded a sham acupuncture control group (Alecrim 2005; Alecrim
2006; Alecrim 2008; Ceccherelli 1992; Diener 2006; Facco 2008;
Li 2012; Linde K 2005; Linde M 2004; Vincent 1989; Wallasch

 2012; Wang 2015; Weinschütz 1993; Weinschütz 1994; Zhao
2014), five a no-acupuncture control group (Facco 2008; Jena
2008; Linde K 2005; Linde M 2000; Vickers 2004), and five a
comparator group receiving prophylactic drug treatment (Allais
2002; Diener 2006; Facco 2013; Hesse 1994; Streng 2006). Six-
teen trials were performed in a single centre and six were mul-
ticentre trials. Seven trials were performed in Germany, four in
Italy, three in Brazil, two each in China, Sweden and the UK, and
one each in Denmark and Australia. Seven trials were published
between 1989 and 2002 and 15 between 2004 and 2015. We tried
to contact corresponding authors of all trials at least once (either
for previous versions of this review or for the current update). For
one trial we could not obtain a valid contact address (Hesse 1994)
and three study authors or co-authors did not provide additional
information before completion of this update (Wallasch 2012;
Weinschütz 1993; Weinschütz 1994). For the remaining 18 tri-
als we obtained some additional information. Detailed additional
data for effect size calculation was obtained from study authors
or from the individual patient database of the ATC for 11 trials
(Alecrim 2005; Alecrim 2006; Alecrim 2008; Allais 2002; Diener
2006; Jena 2008; Li 2012; Linde K 2005; Streng 2006; Vickers
2004; Vincent 1989).
Study participants
Fifteen trials included participants diagnosed as having migraine
with or without aura, six exclusively participants without aura,
and one recruited only women with menstrually-related migraine
(Linde M 2004). In two large, pragmatic multicentre trials (Jena
2008; Vickers 2004) baseline headache frequency and the reported
diagnoses make it likely that, in spite of the use of the criteria
of the International Headache Society, there was some diagnostic
misclassification (i.e. some participants were likely to suffer from
tension-type headache and not migraine). This applied to a minor
extent also to three other multicenter trials (Diener 2006; Linde
K 2005; Streng 2006).
Acupuncture interventions
The acupuncture interventions tested in the included trials varied
toagreatextent.Five trials(Allais 2002; Ceccherelli1992; Li2012;
Wallasch 2012; Zhao 2014 ) standardized acupuncture treatments
(all participants were treated at the same points); seven (Alecrim
2006; Diener 2006; Facco 2013; Linde K 2005; Linde M 2000;
Linde M 2004; Wang 2015) semi-standardized treatments (either
all participants were treated at some basic points and additional
individualized points, or there were different predefined needling
schemes depending on symptom patterns); and 10 trials individu-
alized the selection of acupuncture points (Alecrim 2005; Alecrim
2008; Facco 2008; Hesse 1994; Jena 2008; Streng 2006; Vickers
2004; Vincent 1989; Weinschütz 1993; Weinschütz 1994). The
number of treatment sessions was between six and 12 in 13 tri-
als, and 16 or more in nine trials. Most trials reporting the dura-
tion of sessions, left needles in place for between 20 and 30 min-
utes; one trial (Hesse 1994) investigated brief needling for a few
seconds. Electro-stimulation of needles was used in one trial (Li
2012). Agreement among acupuncturists on whether they would
do acupuncture similarly to that used in the study assessed and
whether they had confidence in the quality of the acupuncture was
low (intra-class correlation coefficients -0.08 and 0.24). For two
studies (Hesse 1994; Linde M 2004) both acupuncturists rating
the study had 50% or less confidence that the acupuncture had ad-
equate quality. For a furthersix studies (Ceccherelli1992; Li 2012;
Linde M 2000; Wallasch 2012; Weinschütz 1993; Weinschütz
1994) at least one acupuncturist gave a rating of 50% or lower.
We could not assess four trials using individualized treatments not
described in detail (Alecrim2005; Alecrim2008; Facco 2008; Jena
2008).
Comparator interventions
Five trials included a group which either received treatment of
acute attacks only (Facco 2008; Linde K 2005; Linde M 2000)
or ’routine care’ that was not specified by protocol (Jena 2008;
Vickers 2004), while the experimental group received acupunc-
ture in addition. In the 15 trials with a sham control, techniques
varied considerably. Four trials superficially needled recognized
acupuncture points considered inadequate for the treatment of mi-
graine (Alecrim 2005; Alecrim 2006; Alecrim 2008; Zhao 2014);
seven trials used needling (mostly superficial) of non-acupuncture
points at variable distance from true points (Diener 2006; Li 2012;
Linde K 2005; Vincent 1989; Wallasch 2012; Weinschütz 1993;
Weinschütz 1994). Two trials (Facco 2008; Linde M 2004) used
’placebo’ needles (telescopic needles with blunt tips not penetrat-
ing the skin). In Linde M 2004 these were placed at the same pre-
defined points as in the true treatment group. Facco 2008 had two
sham groups: in one group the placebo needles were placed at cor-
rect, individualized points after the same process of Chinese diag-
nosis as in the true treatment group. In the second group placebo
needles were placed at standardized points without the ’Chinese
ritual’ (to investigate whether the different interaction and process
affected outcomes). One study (Ceccherelli 1992) used a complex
procedure without real needling. One study used a mix of super-
ficial needling at non-acupuncture points and a non-penetrating
technique (with a blunted cocktail stick) for points on the head
(Wang 2015). Five trials compared acupuncture to prophylactic
drug treatment, using metoprolol (Hesse 1994; Streng 2006), flu-
narizine (Allais 2002), valproic acid (Facco 2013) or individual-
ized treatment according to guidelines (Diener 2006). In four of
these trials participants were unblinded, while one blinded trial
used a double-dummy approach (true acupuncture + metoprolol
placebo vs. metoprolol + sham acupuncture; Hesse 1994).

 Excluded studies
Results were not yet available for eight studies registered in trial
registries likelyto meet selection criteria. For four of these, detailed
protocols have been published (Chen 2013; Lan 2013; Vas 2008;
Zhang 2013); for the other four only the registry entries were
available (Li 2007; Liang 2013; Wang J 2015; Xing 2015). For
at least four trials recruitment has been completed (Lan 2013; Li
2007; Vas 2008; Wang J 2015) (see Characteristics of ongoing
studies).
Twenty studies (described in 23 publications) did not meet se-
lection criteria (Agro 2005; Boutouyrie 2010; Ceccherelli 2012;
Deng 2006; Ferro 2012; Foroughipour 2014; Han 2011; Jia 2009;
Matra 2012; Qin 2006; Vijayalakshmi 2014; Wang 2011; Wu
2011; Yang 2009; Yang 2011; Zhang 2006; Zhang 2009; Zheng
2013; Zhong 2009; Zhou 2007). A number of Chinese trials were
excluded due to inadequate duration of prophylactic drug treat-
ment (several Chinese trials gave flunarizine or other drugs for four
weeks only), overall observation of less than eight weeks, inclusion
of participants with recent onset of migraine, and lack of relevant
outcome measures. Furthermore, five trials included in the previ-
ousversionof ourreviewwere excluded(Baust 1978; Doerr-Proske
1985; Dowson 1985; Henry 1985; Wylie 1997). Reasons for ex-
clusions are reported in the Characteristics of excluded studies.
Studies awaiting classification
We classified three trials (five publications) identified by our most
recent update search as awaiting assessment (see Characteristics
of studies awaiting classification). One (Giannini 2015) is an ab-
stract of an interim analysis of a trial comparing acupuncture and
individualized prophylactic drug treatment. The abstract does not
provide sufficient information but based on background infor-
mation available to one of us (KL) it seems likely that the trial
will meet our eligibility criteria when a full publication with final
data becomes available. A second trial originating from China (Li
2016) was published in February and April 2016 after all analy-
ses for this review had been completed. The two publications fo-
cus on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) outcomes
but also report headache frequency data for participants complet-
ing all fMRI measurements. It seems likely that these trials will
meet inclusion criteria. A third trial of uncertain eligibility (par-
ticipants with “menstrual headache”) is available only in Chinese
(Sun 2015). Full text translation has to be available before final
assessment of eligibility.
Risk of bias in included studies
We discuss the methodological quality of trials (risk of bias) for
the three comparisons separately, as problems differ according to
control groups. The risk of bias assessments of single trials are
displayed in Figure 2; a summary across trials is presented in Figure
3. It should be noted that three trials rated unclear for the item
’incomplete follow-up outcome data’ actually did not include a
follow-up (Ceccherelli 1992; Jena 2008; Zhao 2014).

(Diener 2006, Facco 2008, Linde K 2005) blinding was assessed for the comparisons with sham. For the
comparisons with no acupuncture/prophylactic drugs the risk of bias is high (no blinding).

Comparisons with no acupuncture (acute treatment
only or routine care)
Four trials (Facco 2008; Jena 2008; Linde K 2005; Vickers 2004)
used adequate methods for allocation sequence generation and
concealment of allocation when judged according to the Cochrane
’Risk of bias’ tool (Higgins 2011). According to the definition of
the ATC, three trials (Jena 2008; Linde K 2005; Vickers 2004)
were “unambiguously adequately concealed”. For the two other
trials sequence generation was adequate but concealment was in-
adequate (Linde M 2000) or not fully adequate (Facco 2008).
Given the comparison between acupuncture and no acupuncture,
the participants (who were also assessing all relevant outcomes)
were unblinded in all six trials. In consequence, bias could not
be ruled out. The use of headache diaries to monitor symptoms
closely over a long period of time (Linde K 2005; Linde M 2000;
Vickers 2004) might be less prone to bias than the use of ques-
tionnaires with retrospective assessment of symptoms for the pre-
ceding weeks (Facco 2008; Jena 2008). Attrition in the first three
months was high in Linde M 2000 and minor to moderate in the
remaining trials. The analyses of Jena 2008, Linde K 2005 and
Vickers 2004 took account of attrition, suggesting a low risk of
bias. This also applied to the long-term follow-up in Vickers 2004.
Facco 2008 presented only a per-protocol analysis. Although pre-
sentation of results was not always optimal, we considered the risk
of selective reporting to be low as the most important outcome
measures were always presented and consistent. Overall, due to the
lack of blinding in all studies there was some risk of performance
and detection bias for this comparison.
Comparisons with sham interventions
We could not formally assess the quality of Alecrim 2005, for
which only an abstract and additional unpublished information
provided by the authors were available. Unpublished information
provided by the authors and published information from the two
other trials (Alecrim 2006; Alecrim 2008) conducted by the same
groupsuggestedthatthe riskof biasinthistrial waslow. Among the
13 trials formally assessed, the risk of bias regarding sequence gen-
eration was low for 10 (Alecrim 2006; Alecrim 2008; Ceccherelli
1992; Diener 2006; Facco 2008; Li 2012; Linde K 2005; Linde
M 2004; Wang 2015; Zhao 2014) and unclear in five. Publica-
tions for five trials reported adequate methods of allocation con-
cealment (Alecrim 2006; Alecrim 2008; Diener 2006; Li 2012;
Linde K 2005); for a further two trials, such information was pro-
vided by the authors (Ceccherelli 1992; Facco 2008). All the tri-
als attempted to blind participants. Several trials that used sham
interventions which were not strictly indistinguishable from ’true’
acupuncture (Ceccherelli 1992; Diener 2006; Facco 2008; Linde
K 2005) did not mention explicitly the use of a sham or placebo
control in the informed consent procedure. This is ethically prob-
lematic, but enhances the credibility of the sham interventions.
Taking into account also the results of the trials, we considered the
risk of bias to be low in all trials. Reporting of dropouts was insuffi-
16

 cient in several older trials. We considered the risk of bias to be low
regarding short-term outcomes (up to three months) in nine trials
(Alecrim 2006; Alecrim 2008; Diener 2006; Li 2012; Linde K
2005; Linde M2004; Vincent 1989; Wang 2015; Zhao2014), and
low regarding long-term outcomes in six (Alecrim 2008; Diener
2006; Li 2012; Linde K 2005; Linde M 2004; Wang 2015). For
two trials (Weinschütz 1993; Weinschütz 1994) outcomes were
reported so inadequately that selective reporting could not be ruled
out. Overall, the risk of bias was variable, but, particularly in the
three largest trials, good quality. However, as acupuncturists could
not be blinded in any trial performance, bias could not be ruled
out completely.
Comparisons with prophylactic drug treatment
Three trials (Allais 2002; Diener 2006; Streng 2006) used ad-
equate methods for sequence generation and concealment, one
trial reported an adequate method for sequence generation but
insufficient detail regarding concealment (Facco 2013), and one
trial (Hesse 1994) did not describe the methods. Four trials (Allais
2002; Diener 2006; Facco 2013; Streng 2006)comparedacupunc-
ture and drug treatment in an open manner, which implies that
bias on this level is possible. The use of a double-dummy tech-
nique allowed participant blinding in Hesse 1994, but this ap-
proach might be associated with other problems (see Discussion).
While there is little risk of bias due to low attrition rates in Allais
2002 and Hesse 1994, and unclear risk in Facco 2013, a relevant
problem occurred in the two German trials (Diener 2006; Streng
2006). The recruitment situation for these trials made it likely
that participants had a preference for acupuncture. This resulted
in a high proportion of participants allocated to drug treatment
withdrawing informed consent immediately after randomisation
(34% in Diener 2006 and 13% in Streng 2006), as well as high
treatment discontinuation (18% in Diener 2006) or dropout rates
due to adverse effects (16% in Streng 2006). These trials did not
include participants refusing informed consent immediately after
randomisation in analyses, and one (Streng 2006) also excluded
early dropouts. Such analyses should normally tend to favour drug
treatment. Both trials presented additional analyses restricted to
participants complying with the protocol. All five trials presented
the most important outcomes measured, so we considered the risk
of bias of selective reporting to be low. Overall, as four of the tri-
als were not blinded and two trials had a problem with relevant
attrition in the drug group there is a considerable risk of bias (see
also Discussion).

Comparisons with no acupuncture (acute treatment
only or routine care)
The five trials comparing acupuncture with a control group receiv-
ing either treatment of acute migraine attacks only or routine care
are clinically very heterogeneous. Facco 2008 performed a four-
armed trial (n = 160) in which participants in the control group
all received acute treatment of attacks with rizatriptan. Jena 2008
is a very large, highly pragmatic study which included a total of
15,056 headache sufferers recruited by more than 4000 physicians
in Germany. A total of 11,874 people not giving consent to ran-
domisation received up to 15 acupuncture treatments within three
months and were followed for an additional three months. This
was also the case for 1613 participants randomized to immediate
acupuncture, while the remaining 1569 participants remained on
routine care (not further defined) for three months and then re-
ceived acupuncture. The published analysis of this trial is on all
randomized participants, but we received unpublished results of
subgroup analyses on the 1715 participants with migraine from
the study authors for the previous version of our review and we
re-analysed the data from the ATC for this update. Linde M 2000
was a small pilot trial (n = 39) performed in a specialized mi-
graine clinic in Sweden in which control participants continued
with their individualized treatment of acute attacks but did not
receive additional acupuncture. A similar approach was used for
the waiting-list control group in the three-armed (also sham con-
trol group) Linde K 2005 (n = 302) trial. Finally, in the Vickers
2004 trial (n = 401), acupuncture in addition to routine care in the
British National Health Service was compared to a strategy, ’avoid
acupuncture’. In addition to the strong clinical heterogeneity, the
methods and timing of outcome measurement in these trials also
differed considerably.
Therefore, pooled effect size estimates have to be interpreted with
caution. Nevertheless, the findings show that acupuncture treat-
ment is associated with a moderately large short-term benefit com-
pared to no acupuncture control groups (Figure 4; Figure 5).

Among the four trials providing sufficient data the pooled fixed-
effects standardized mean difference (SMD) was -0.56 (95% CI
-0.65 to -0.48; 2199 participants); findings were statistically het-
erogeneous (P value = 0.07; I² = 57%; random-effects estimate -
0.53; 95% CI -0.72 to -0.34).
After treatment, headache frequency at least halved in 41% of par-
ticipants receiving acupuncture and 17% receiving no acupunc-
ture. The fixed effects risk ratio (RR) was 2.40 (95% CI 2.08 to
2.76; 4 trials, 2519 participants); there was no indication of sta-
tistical heterogeneity (P value = 0.36; I² = 7%). We consider these
findings after treatment as moderate quality evidence because as
the large trials consistently show clinically relevant differences, in
spite of the risk of bias due to lack of blinding, we found some in-
dication of heterogeneity (headache frequency) and clinical differ-
ences between trials. The corresponding number needed to treat
for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 4 (95% CI 3 to
6). There was only one trial with a follow-up beyond three months
(Vickers 2004; 12 month follow-up). The SMD (frequency) was
-0.36 (95% CI -0.59 to -0.12; 284 participants with data) and
the RR for response was 2.16 (95% CI 1.35 to 3.45; 377 partic-
ipants). The NNTB based on this trial was 7 (95% CI 4.00 to
25.00; proportion of participants with response in the sham group
11%). Although the trial was large we consider its long-term find-
18

 ings to be low quality evidence as, given the variable effect sizes
after treatment in the available trials, future trials performed in
different settings might well yield different effect sizes. Findings
in the time window analyses are consistent with those of the main
analysis (Analysis 1.3; Analysis 1.4). The single specific frequency
outcomes, migraine attacks, migraine days and headache days were
not measured or reported in any trials but findings were consistent
with those in our primary outcome, headache frequency (Analysis
1.5; Analysis 1.6; Analysis 1.7). This also applies to the outcomes
headache intensity, analgesic use and headache scores (Analysis
1.8; Analysis 1.9; Analysis 1.10). We did not explore reasons for
heterogeneity due to the small number of trials.
The number of participants not reaching the primary endpoint
was slightly lower in acupuncture than in non-acupuncture groups
(OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.05); there was some heterogeneity
(P value = 0.13; I² = 47%). In the two trials reporting reasons for
attritionthere were nodropoutsdue toadverse effects.Information
on other safety/acceptability outcomes was reported insufficiently
(see Analysis 1.11).
Comparisons with sham interventions
Both after treatment (12 trials providing data from 1646 partici-
pants) and at follow-up (10 trials, 1534 participants) acupuncture
was associated with a small but statistically significant frequency
reduction over sham in the fixed-effect analyses (Figure 6). The
SMD was -0.18 (95% -0.28 to -0.08; P value from the Chi² test
for heterogeneity = 0.04, I² = 47%) after treatment and -0.19
(95% -0.30 to -0.09; P value from the Chi² test for heterogeneity
= 0.01, I² = 59%) at follow-up. The results of the random-effects
models were similar (SMD -0.24; 95% CI -0.41 to -0.07 for post-
treatment, SMD-0.16; 95% CI -0.37 to 0.04 at follow-up).

 After treatment, headache frequency at least halved in 50% of
participants receiving true acupuncture and 41% receiving sham
acupuncture (pooled RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.36; P value =
0.02, I² = 48%; 14 trials, 1825 participants) and at follow-up in
53% and 42%, respectively. The pooled fixed effects RR was 1.23
(95% CI 1.11 to 1.36; P value from the Chi² test for heterogeneity
= 0.02, I² = 48%; 14 trials, 1825 participants) after treatment and
1.25 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.39; P value from the Chi² test for hetero-
geneity = 0.004, I² = 61%; 11 trials, 1683 participants) at follow-
up (Figure 7). The corresponding NNTB would be 11 (95% CI
7.00 to 20.00) after treatment and 10 (95% CI 6.00 to 18.00) at
follow-up. Random-effects RRs were 1.39 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.69)
and 1.33 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.70). The results were dominated by
the three large, high-quality trials (Diener 2006; Li 2012; Linde K
2005; 75% and 82% weight, respectively, in the meta-analyses).
We consider the findings for the outcomes headache frequency
and response both after treatment and at follow-up as moderate
quality evidence (indication of heterogeneity and small effect sizes
leaving magnitude and statistical significance of effect open to
some change with more trials). The time windows analyses yielded
findings which were consistent with our main analyses (Analysis
2.3; Analysis 2.4). Specific frequency outcomes as well as inten-
sity, analgesic use and headache scores were typically available for
less than half of the trials (Analysis 2.5; Analysis 2.6; Analysis 2.7;
Analysis 2.8; Analysis 2.9; Analysis 2.10).

 We performed subgroup analyses to investigate four potential
sources of heterogeneity for both frequency and response, both
after treatment and follow-up (four analyses for each potential
source of heterogeneity). While there were suggestionsof subgroup
differences, heterogeneity tended to remain considerable in most
subgroups across analyses. Effects of acupuncture over sham were
significantly smaller in the three unambiguously adequately con-
cealed trials (which were also by far the three largest trials) than in
the remaining trials in three (Analysis 2.11; Analysis 2.13 Analysis
2.14) of four analyses (no significant difference in Analysis 2.12).
In the analyses grouping trials into smaller and larger (number of
participant up to or above the median number of participants in
the trials included in the analysis) studies’ differences tended to be
somewhat smaller in larger trials but these findings were mainly
driven by the three larger, unambiguously adequately concealed
trials (Analysis 2.15; Analysis 2.16; Analysis 2.17; Analysis 2.22).
Consistently, effects over sham tended to be larger in trials with 16
or more treatment sessions compared to trials with up to 12 ses-
sions ( Analysis 2.18; Analysis 2.19; Analysis 2.20; Analysis 2.21;
). Effects also tended to be somewhat larger in trials using non-
penetrating sham techniques, however, only three relatively small
trials used such sham techniques (Analysis 2.23; Analysis 2.24;
Analysis 2.25; Analysis 2.26). Re-including the five trials excluded
for this update (but included in the previous version of this review)
had only minimal impact on results.
In the seven trials reporting this outcome only three of 621 partic-
ipants receiving acupuncture and none of 310 in control groups
dropped out due to adverse effects (OR 2.84; 95% CI 0.43 to
18.71; 7 trials, 931 participants; I² = 0%). We consider this low
quality evidence as there is great uncertainty regarding the effect
estimate due to the very small number of such dropouts. Only
the four largest trials reported the number of participants report-
ing adverse effects. Among 847 participants receiving acupuncture
138 (16%) reported adverse effects compared to 98 (17%) receiv-
ing sham (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.56; I² = 0%; moderate
quality evidence; Analysis 2.27). There were also no significant
differences in the number of participants not reaching the primary
endpoint of the trial (OR 1.14; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.67; 11 trials,
1770 participants) and experiencing serious adverse events (OR
1.29; 95% CI 0.43 to 3.83; 6 trials, 1071 participants; Analysis
2.27).
Comparisons with prophylactic drug treatment
The results of Hesse 1994 regarding treatment effectiveness were
not reported in a manner that allowed effect size estimation.
Overall, the findings of this trial, which used a double-dummy
design (true acupuncture plus metoprolol placebo versus sham
acupuncture plus metoprolol), showed similar improvements in
both groups, slightly favouring the sham acupuncture plus meto-
prolol group. The acupuncture technique used in this trial (very
brief needling of individual trigger points) was rather unusual and
was considered with skepticism by our acupuncturists. The prag-
matic trial, Facco 2013, which compared a traditional acupunc-
ture strategy with valproic acid, did not use a headache diary, but
only a questionnaire including the Migraine Disability (MIDAS)
instrument (Stewart 2001). Participants were asked to report the
number of headache days over periods of three months. The pub-
lication reported very large improvements (the median number of
headache days went down from 18 days before the trial, to four
days during the treatment phase and during the follow-up phase
in the acupuncture group, and from 17 to three and six days in
the group receiving valproic acid), and very little variation (narrow
interquartile ranges). The first author provided means and stan-
dard deviations, but standard deviations were very small. As we
were uncertain about the reliability of the data we decided to not
include it in meta-analysis.
The remaining three trials could be entered into meta-analyses.
Acupuncture reduced migraine frequency significantly more than
drug prophylaxis after treatment (SMD -0.25; 95% CI -0.39 to -
0.10; 739 participants) while differences were smaller at follow-up
and were not significantly different (SMD -0.13; 95% CI -0.28
to 0.01; P value = 0.08; 744 participants; see Figure 8).

Headache frequency
Findings were similar for response (Figure 9). After a median fol-
low-up of three months headache frequency at least halved in 57%
of participants receiving acupuncture and 46% receiving prophy-
lactic drugs, and after six months in 59% and 54%, respectively.
The RR was 1.24 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.44; 743 participants) after
treatment and 1.11 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.26; 744 participants) at fol-
low-up. Findings were consistent among trials with P values from
the Chi² test for heterogeneity being above 0.5 and I² being 0%
in all analyses. While there was risk of bias due to lack of blind-
ing in all three trials and relevant attrition in two trials, and fu-
ture trials might not confirm the small effects of acupuncture over
prophylactic drug treatment, we consider the highly consistent
trial findings for both outcomes and both time points as moderate
quality evidence that acupuncture is non-inferior to prophylac-
tic drug treatment.The time window analyses are consistent with
these findings as are the findings on additional outcomes (Analysis
3.5; Analysis 3.6; Analysis 3.7; Analysis 3.8; Analysis 3.9; Analysis
3.10).

 In the four studies reporting this outcome three (1%) of 227 par-
ticipants receiving acupuncture dropped out due to adverse effects
compared to 16 (7%) receiving prophylactic drugs (OR 0.27; 95%
CI 0.08 to 0.86; I² = 0%; Analysis 3.11). All five trials provided
the number of participants reporting adverse effects. Probably due
to different methods for documenting this outcome the absolute
frequency of adverse effects in both groups varied greatly between
trials. A total of 90 (17%) of 520 participants receiving acupunc-
ture reported adverse effects compared to 140 (34%) of 411 par-
ticipants receiving prophylactic drug treatment (OR 0.25; 95% CI
0.10 to 0.62; I² = 78%, P value from Chi² test for heterogeneity =
0.001). Despite some limitations (uncertainty regarding dropouts
due to low event rates and heterogeneity regarding reporting of ad-
verse effects) we consider this moderate quality evidence as study
findings consistently favour acupuncture over prophylactic drug
treatment. Furthermore, study findings also favoured acupuncture
for the number of participants not reaching the primary endpoint
(OR 0.28; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.78; 4 trials, 995 participants; I² =
80%; P value = 0.002). Serious adverse events were reported in
seven (2%) of 313 participants receiving acupuncture compared
to four (1%) of 307 participants receiving prophylactic drugs (OR
1.33; 95% CI 0.38 to 4.73; 4 trials; I² = 0%).

Summary of main results
Several trials using quite variable methods and interventions con-
sistently showed that the addition of acupuncture to treatment of
acute migraine attacks or to routine care was beneficial for at least
three months. Compared to no treatment or routine care only
(which includes treatment of acute migraine attacks and possi-
bly other interventions) the size of the effect seemed to be mod-
erate according to usual standards for classifying effect size mea-
sures such as standardized mean differences. The only trial that
investigated long-term effects showed a sustained small to moder-
ate response to acupuncture in addition to routine care provided
by a GP (Vickers 2004). Compared to sham acupuncture, true
acupuncture interventions were associated with small but statisti-
cally significant effects both after treatment and at follow-up, but
findings were statistically heterogeneous. In the largest, adequately
concealed trials differences were even smaller (but still statistically
significant). The pooled analyses of the available trials comparing
acupuncture interventions with evidence-based prophylactic drug
treatment found a superiority of acupuncture at completion of
treatment, though at follow-up differences were no longer statisti-
cally significant. Compared to drug prophylaxis fewer participants
dropped out due adverse effects or reported adverse effects.
Possible explanations of the findings
The interpretation of the findings of our review remains challeng-
ing. While, contrary to the results of the previous version of our
review, differences between true acupuncture and sham interven-
tions became statistically significant (after the inclusion of four
new sham-controlled trials), it seems still surprising that the size of
the effect over sham is similar to that over prophylactic treatment
with drugsthathave beenshowntobe superiortoplacebo(Schürks
2008). Three factors could explain these findings (probably in
combination). Firstly, sham acupuncture might have direct phys-
iological effects on mechanisms relevant to migraine symptoms,
secondly, acupuncture might be a particularly potent placebo, and
thirdly, due to the lack of blinding, comparisons with routine care
and prophylactic drug treatment might be biased.
We consider each of these possible explanations in turn.
Physiological effects of sham acupuncture
Many sham acupuncture procedures involve needling locations
that are not traditional points with the same frequency and du-
ration as in the true acupuncture group. In some studies needles
are inserted into classical acupuncture points not indicated in mi-
graine. Most physiological mechanisms proposed for acupuncture
do not necessarily imply point specificity (Bäcker 2004). Even the
non-penetrating ’placebo’ needles might activate unmyelinated
(C ’tactile’) afferent nerves which can influence pain perception
(Lund 2006). Several researchers have argued that some effects of
acupuncture might not be point-specific (Han 1997; Lundeberg
2007), and that these might be particularly relevant for treating
conditions other than localized nociceptive pain (Thomas 1996;
Borud 2010). In individual patient data meta-analysis, acupunc-
ture was significantly superior to all categories of control group.
For trials that used penetrating needles for sham control, acupunc-
ture had smaller effect sizes than for trials with non-penetrating
sham or sham control without needles (MacPherson 2014).
Sham acupuncture as a strong placebo
According to the available evidence, the most important mecha-
nisms for placebo effects are expectations, conditioning, anxiety
reduction and social support (Crow 1999; Benedetti 2008). These
elements are likely to be influenced by the treatment setting, its
context and its meaning. Acupuncture - with its repeated sessions,
intense provider contact, slightly painful procedure, an often ’ex-
otic’ model of symptom explanation and associated relaxation dur-
ing sessions - might maximize such effects.
While the average clinical effect of placebo interventions seems to
be small (Hróbjartsson 2010), there is some evidence that sham
acupuncture is associated with larger effects than, for example,
a placebo pill or other non-pharmacological sham interventions.
This evidence comes from one of the few randomized trials directly
comparing different types of placebo (Kaptchuk 2006), from in-
direct comparison of trials including both a sham and a no-treat-
ment control (Linde 2010a), and from a network meta-analysis of
pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments and their
placebos in migraine prophylaxis (Meissner 2013). Furthermore,
a systematic review of randomized trials of acupuncture includ-
ing both a sham and a no-treatment control found on average
moderately large (SMD 0.45) differences (Linde 2010b). It seems
highly plausible that both the physiological and strong placebo ef-
fects contribute to these considerable ’non-specific’ effects of sham
acupuncture. For example, a recent trial showed that the size of
the effect associated with a sham acupuncture intervention can
vary with the amount and characteristics of the patient-provider
interaction (Kaptchuk 2008). Both the above explanations would
also imply that it would be difficult to detect any small, point-spe-
cific effects in addition to potent placebo effects and non-specific
needling effects.
Possible bias due to lack of blinding
While participants in the sham-controlled trials were blinded, this
was (with the exception of the trial by Hesse 1994) not the case
for the comparisons with treatment of acute migraine attacks only,
routine care or other treatments. All clinically relevant outcome
measures in clinical trials in migraine are patient-reported (IHS
2000; IHS 2012). Preferably, outcomes are documented in diaries
for at least four weeks before treatment and for longer time peri-
ods during and after treatment. It cannot be ruled out that par-
ticipants allocated to acupuncture reported positively biased out-
30

 comes, while participants allocated to control reported negatively
biased outcomes. However, response rates in participants allocated
to drug treatment in the trials included in this review were compa-
rable to those reported in drug trials (Van der Kuy 2002). Also, in
groups receiving acute treatment only, response rates were within
the range of placebo groups in drug trials (Van der Kuy 2002).
In two trials comparing acupuncture and drug treatment (Diener
2006; Streng 2006), a relevant proportion of participants with-
drew informed consent immediately after allocation to drug treat-
ment. Additional participants dropped out during the study. This
indicates that study participants had a preference for acupuncture.
These problems could seriously bias the findings. However, par-
ticipants not starting treatment were not included in the analyses,
and per-protocol analyses confirmed the study findings. Still, these
trials must be interpreted with caution.
A fourth possible explanation for the lack of larger effects of true
acupuncture over sham comes from the perspective of acupuncture
practitioners. The quality of acupuncture interventions in clinical
trials is often disputed. Study protocols often limit the flexibility of
treatment procedures, particularly in sham-controlled trials, and
it is argued that better acupuncturists would have achieved better
results. However, response rates in sham-controlled trials were on
average similar to those in pragmatic trials with flexible treatments.
Furthermore, while there is always the possibility that some expert
acupuncturists are particularly successful, in several of the larger
trials included in this review the training of treatment providers
was at least comparable to that of the average acupuncturists in
their country. Still, it cannot be ruled out that inadequate study
interventions contribute to the lack of differences compared to
sham interventions.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Acupuncture is a therapy which is applied in a variable manner in
different countries and settings. For example, in Germany, where
the majority of the large trials included in this review were per-
formed, acupuncture is mainly provided by general practitioners
and other physicians. Their approach to acupuncture is based on
the theories of traditional Chinese medicine, although the amount
of training they receive in traditional Chinese medicine is limited
(Weidenhammer 2007). In the UK, the providers are likely to be
non-medical acupuncturists with a comparatively intense tradi-
tional training, physiotherapists or medical doctors with a more
’Western’ approach (Dale 1997). The trials included in our review
come from a variety of countries, and study designs range from
very pragmatic (Jena 2008; Vickers 2004) to more experimental
(Linde M 2004). Despite this distinct heterogeneity, within com-
parisons the findings seem broadly consistent.
Acupuncture is widely used in Asian countries, particularly China.
We have not systematically searched Chinese databases for this
version of the review, but plan to do so in the future. There is
considerable skepticism toward clinical trials from China, as in
the past results were almost exclusively positive (Vickers 1998).
However, the quality and number of randomized trials published
in Chinese have improved over recent years (Wang 2007), and it
seems inadequate to neglect this evidence without examining it
critically. Most of the identified, registered ongoing trials origi-
nate from China. Our update search (in non-Chinese databases)
identified a number of trials from China but only two met inclu-
sion criteria (Li 2012; Zhao 2014). When reading excluded trials
we noticed several characteristics which suggest that at least some
migraine studies from China are different and problematic from
the point of view of Western headache research. Excluded trials
often included participants with recent-onset of migraine, given
acupuncture with the aim of ’curing’ the condition. These trials
seem hardly comparable to the many trials that included partici-
pants who had been suffering from migraine for a long time. Fur-
thermore, most trials, including a group receiving prophylactic
drugs, gave these only for four weeks, a period considered much
too short by Western headache specialists (IHS 2012). Chinese
trials also tend to use a higher number of treatment sessions and
higher treatment frequency.
Large-scale observational studies (Jena 2008; Melchart 2006) and
a systematic comparison of findings from a randomized and an
observational study (Linde 2007a) suggest that the response rates
observed in clinical trials are also seen in conditions similar to rou-
tine practice. However, as the overall evidence also suggests that
factors other than the correct selection of acupuncture points and
needling procedures play an important role in outcomes, treat-
ment setting and participant selection could have a strong impact
and might vary considerably. For example, a pooled analysis of
four trials on chronic pain (including Linde K 2005) found that
even four months after completion of treatment, participants who
had started acupuncture with a positive attitude and expectation
had significantly better outcomes than participants with lower ex-
pectations (Linde 2007b).
People with migraine typically suffer from their headaches over
many years. A general shortcoming of almost all randomized trials
of any prophylactic treatments is their limited duration (rarely ever
more than 12 months). Therefore, based on our review nothing
can be said on sustainability of effects beyond 12 months.
Quality of the evidence
The methodological quality of the included trials was variable.
Methods for sequence generation, allocation concealment, han-
dling of dropouts and withdrawals and reporting of findings were
adequate in most of the recent trials. Still, designing and perform-
ing clinical trials of acupuncture is a challenge, particularly with
respect to blinding and selection of control interventions. We have
mentioned that bias cannot be ruled out in the unblinded studies,
31

 and that comparisons with prophylactic drug treatment have to
be interpreted with caution due to high dropout rates in two of
the trials. Blinding in comparisons with drug treatment could be
achieved by double-dummy designs (drug plus sham acupuncture
versus acupuncture plus drug placebo) as in the trials by Hesse
1994. However, if it is the case that sham acupuncture interven-
tions are strong placebos and not physiologically inert, this ap-
proach would also be problematic.
We considered the overall quality of the evidence for most out-
comes to be moderate. Reasons for not considering the quality of
evidence to be high were lack of blinding of participants (for com-
parisons with no acupuncture controls and prophylactic drugs),
unblinded treatment providers (all comparisons), indications of
heterogeneity for some outcomes or major imprecision in the case
of the outcome dropouts due to adverse effects. We did not fur-
ther downgrade our rating because findings consistently showed
clinically relevant effects in spite of variable effect sizes (efficacy
outcomes for the comparison with no acupuncture controls) or
very similar findings (efficacy outcomes for the comparison with
prophylactic drugs).
Potential biases in the review process
We are confident that we have identified the existing large clinical
trials relevant to our question, but we cannot rule out the possi-
bility that there are additional small trials which are unpublished
or published in sources not accessible to our search.
A relevant problem for systematic reviews on prophylactic treat-
ments of migraine is the highly variable outcome measurement
and the often inadequate reporting of results. Various measures of
frequency, intensity, analgesic use and other outcomes are used,
and as these measures have to be observed over longer time pe-
riods, the amount of data needed to obtain a good overview of
the course of symptoms is considerable. Most trials in our review
reported several outcome measures at different time points with-
out evidence that these were selected in a biased way. Neverthe-
less, we were confronted with a complex mosaic of data. Several
authors kindly provided unpublished data. Some sort of response
and frequency measure was available for almost all trials, although
the timing of the measurement and details of the measure often
differed. As overall results are rather consistent, it seems unlikely
that our results would have changed in a relevant manner if miss-
ing data had been available.
Four members of the review team were involved in at least one of
the included trials. These trials were assessed by other members
of the review team. All reviewers currently have affiliations to a
CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) research centre,
or have had such an affiliation in the past.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
We are not aware of any systematic reviews published after the
previous version of our review (Linde 2009) focusing exclusively
onrandomizedtrialsof acupuncture forthe prophylaxisof episodic
migraine. The analysis of the pooled individual database of the
Acupuncture Trialists’ Collaboration analysing high quality trials
on chronic pain (Vickers 2012) included three trials also included
here. The findings are consistent with those presented here. This
applies also to a review of placebo- and sham-controlled trials of a
variety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological prophylactic
treatment focusing on the differential effectiveness of the placebo
treatments (Meissner 2013).
Compared to the previous version of our review, findings are sim-
ilar for the comparisons with no acupuncture and prophylactic
drug treatment, while, at a first glance, our current results seem
more positive for the comparison with sham. In our previous re-
view there were no statistically significant differences between true
and sham acupuncture, neither for frequency nor for response.
The main reason is clearly that our current analyses have consid-
erably more power. This is primarily due to inclusion of new trials
(particularly, the large Li 2012 trial). Furthermore, the approach
to group our analysis by four time windows in our previous ver-
sion further decreased the number of trials per analysis. Finally,
based on the advice of our statistician, in this updatewe have used
fixed-effect models instead of random-effects models for the main
analyses, which leads to narrower confidence intervals (yet, we also
present random-effects estimates confirming our overall results).
If one compares effect estimates qualitatively, findings are very
similar for the time points after treatment (current version) and
two/four months after treatment (previous version). Instead, the
addition of the new trials made our findings more positive for six-
months’ follow-up.
It should also be noted that the original publication of the Li 2012
trial, which compared each of the three tested acupuncture inter-
ventions against sham separately, did not report significant differ-
ences after treatment. We pooled the data of the three acupuncture
groups (ensuring that the sham group was not counted more than
once as a control) which explains that the observed difference is
statistically significant for this trial in our analyses.

Implications for practice
Acupuncture seems to be effective for migraine prophylaxis. The
effects over sham acupuncture found in this review were small, but
there were clinically relevant effects over no acupuncture/no pro-
phylactic treatment, and acupuncture compared well with prophy-
lactic drugs regarding effectiveness and side effects. As the findings
of our main analysis on headache frequency use standardized mean
differences as an effect measure they are somewhat difficult to in-
terpret clinically. In terms of number of migraine days, our find-
ings approximately indicate the following: assuming a frequency
32

 of six migraine days per month at baseline, this would be reduced
to five days in the no-treatment control group, to four in the sham
group and the prophylactic drug group, and to three and a half
in the acupuncture group. Acupuncture can be considered as a
treatment option for people with migraine needing prophylactic
treatment because of frequent or inadequately controlled migraine
attacks, particularly people refusing prophylactic drug treatment
or experiencing adverse effects from such treatment.
Implications for research
As migraine is a chronic condition, it would be important for clin-
icians to know how long improvements associated with acupunc-
ture treatment last, whether continued intermittent treatment sus-
tains the effect, and whether a further treatment cycle again leads
to improvement. These latter questions might be best investigated
in cohort studies. In principle, it seems important to know which
types of acupuncture work best, what is the optimal frequency
and duration of sessions, and so on. Some studies have not shown
important differences in the effects of different acupuncture tech-
niques (Jena 2008; Weidenhammer 2006), but this review found
an influence of number of treatment sessions, in line with other
evidence on dose (number of needles, number of sessions) of treat-
ment (MacPherson 2013); these issues could also be investigated
in observational studies. For decision-makers it would be impor-
tant to know who is sufficiently qualified to deliver acupuncture.
Randomized trials comparing outcomes after treatment by differ-
ent types of practitioner are desirable, although very large sample
sizes would be needed. Such studies would also be interesting from
a more scientific perspective because it is unclear to what extent the
effects of acupuncture are mainly mediated by context variables
and generalized (i.e. not specific to traditional points) needling
effects, and what contribution correct point location makes. Al-
though further sham-controlled trials are desirable, we think that
such studies should not have the highest priority unless they also
address other important questions. Further comparisons with pro-
phylactic drug treatment and other non-pharmacological inter-
ventions are needed. To facilitate future meta-analyses, it would
be helpful if some standards for reporting outcome data were es-
tablished.

mation from author)
Condition: migraine with or without aura
Demographics: not reported
Setting: outpatient headache clinic of a neurology department of State University of
Campinas, Brazil
Time since onset of headaches: not reported
Interventions
Acupuncture points: individualized selection according to traditional Chinese medicine
DeChi achieved?: yes (information from author)
Number of treatment sessions: 16
Frequency of sessions: 2/week for first 4 weeks, then 1/week for 8 weeks (information
from author)
Information on acupuncturists: 1 acupuncturist trained in Spain and 12 years of practical
experience (information from author)
Control intervention: sham acupuncture (superficial needling without manipulation at
non-indicated points)
Outcomes
Method for outcome measurement: diary
Notes
This trial is the third in a series performed by the study authors. The trials Alecrim
2006and Alecrim 2008 were performed before this study. The authors provided data for
effect size calculations (50% response rates, migraine days, attacks, rescue medication
use)

Notes
Unblinded, but otherwise rigorous trial; additional information provided from author
The paper presents data on attack frequency and analgesics use for 2-month intervals.
For calculating mean differences in this review the means for attack frequency presented
in the publication were divided by 2, as all other trials refer to 4-week periods. The same
was done with the standard deviations provided by the study author. For calculation of
standardized mean differences we used the 2-month means presented in the publication.
We imputed frequency of response from baseline means and post-treatment (months 3-
4) and follow-up (months 5-6) means and standard deviations

sible for comparison with medication (8 of 313 participants allocated to acupuncture
withdrew consent before the first treatment, 11 of 339 allocated to sham acupuncture
and 106 of 308 allocated to standard treatment; after start of treatment 15 of 305 in the
acupuncture group did not reach the primary endpoint, 11 of 328 in the sham acupunc-
ture group and 15 of 202 in the standard treatment group)
Acupuncturists’ assessment: GA similarly/85% - BB similarly/70%
Participants
Number of participants included/analysed: 960/794
Condition: migraine (IHS)
Demographics: mean age 37 years, 83% female
Observation period: 4 weeks baseline, 6 weeks treatment (+ optionally 2 further weeks)
, 20 weeks follow-up
Setting: 149 primary care physicians in Germany
Time since onset of headaches: mean 16 years
Interventions
Acupuncture points: semi-standardized - depending on Chinese syndrome diagnosis
predefined collections of obligatory and flexible points
Information on acupuncturists: 149 physicians with at least 140 hours’ acupuncture
training and 2 years’ professional experience
DeChi achieved?: yes
Number of treatment sessions: 10 (if moderate response further 5 sessions possible)
Frequency of treatment sessions: 2/week
Control intervention 1: sham acupuncture (superificial needling at distant non-acupunc-
ture points)
Control intervention2:guideline-basedindividualizedstandard treatment -1. preference
beta-blockers, 2. preference flunarizine, 3. preference valproic acid
Outcomes
Method for outcome measurement: diary and interviews
Primary outcome: difference in migraine days between baseline and weeks 23-26 after
randomisation
Other outcomes: migraine days, medication use, response (defined as at least 50% re-
duction of migraine days), pain intensity, impairment, pain days, quality of life, global
assessments
Notes
Very large, rigorous multicenter trial. The interpretation of the comparison with standard
treatment is compromised by the fact that more than a third of participants allocated to
standardtreatmentwithdrewconsent.Noinformationis givenon dosage andcompliance
in the standard treatment group. Authors provided biometrical report
Data for migraine days and response at 6, 13 and 26 used for meta-analysis in this review
were obtained from individual patient data re-analysis within the Acupuncture Trialists’
Collaboration (see section Data collection and analysis)

Notes
Publication reports medians and interquartile ranges; author provided means and vari-
ability data for MIDAS data. However, we decided to not include the data on efficacy
into meta-analyses because standard deviation seemed clinically implausibly small, not
consistent with P values from regression analyses, and the first author could not clarify
the problem

Interventions
Acupuncture points: needling individual trigger points together with placebo tablets
Information on acupuncturist: n = 1, no further information
DeChi achieved?: no information
Number of treatment sessions: individualized
Duration of treatment sessions: needling for a few seconds only
Control intervention: beta blocker metoprolol 100 mg and placebo stimulation (super-
ficial touch with blunt end of the needle)
Outcomes
Method for outcome measurement: diary
Primary outcome: probably attack frequency
Other outcomes: severity, duration, global rating, consumption of analgesics
Notes
Rigorous trial; sham acupuncture procedure possibly distinguishable; non-traditional
acupuncture technique (brief needling at trigger points); mean frequency and mean
severity of attacks in the last 4 weeks were recalculated from raw data in Figure 1

Notes
Large, verypragmaticstudyincludingboth participantswith migraine andTTH; treating
physicians were completely free to choose points, number of sessions (upper limit allowed
15) etc. Unclear what usual care consisted of. Some diagnostic misclassification likely.
Study authors provided raw means, standard deviations and number of observations for
headache days and headache intensity for participants suffering from migraine

Control intervention: sham acupuncture on the points below with manipulation: i) in
the medial arm on the anterior border of the insertion of the deltoid muscle at the
junction of deltoid and biceps muscles; ii) the edge of tibia 1-2 cm lateral to the ST36
horizontally; iii) half between the tip of the elbow and the axilla; iv) ulnar side, half
between epicondylus medialis of the humerus and ulnar side of the wrist. Auxiliary
points: 2 mm lateral to every acupoint or non-acupoint and punctured to a depth of 2
mm without manual stimulation. Transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation (HANS:

tack frequency was reported, while migraine days was reported for other time-points
in addition to attack frequency. For consistency, we used migraine attack data also in
the analysis of frequency in follow-up. The number of responders was only reported
after treatment. Response for later time-points was imputed from means and standard

Acupuncturists’ assessment = At least two reviewers who are trained in acupuncture and have several years of practical experience (GA,
BB, YF, AW) answered two questions. First, they were asked how they would treat the participants included in the study. Answer
options were ’exactly or almost exactly the same way’, ’similarly’, ’differently’, ’completely differently’ or ’could not assess’ due to
insufficient information (on acupuncture or on the participants). Second, they were asked to rate their degree of confidence that

Agro 2005
Participants/control/outcomes: duration of complaints unclear, part of control group received dihydroergo-
tamine as prophylactic treatment, only headache index reported. Only short report with limited detail
Baust 1978
Outcomes: post-randomisation observation period is unclear (individualized 10 typical intervals between
attacks before trial); the only outcome data reported is some sort of response derived from a headache index
(additional information not available). Trial was included in 2009 version of the review

Deng 2006
Methods/participants/control/outcomes: allocation possibly by alternation, participants enter study with acute
attack, only 14 days of treatment with flunarizine, no fitting outcome measure
Doerr-Proske 1985
Participants: contradictory information on headache frequency in baseline/before trial (19 participants had
attacks on 4 or more days per week = > 50%), but baseline data suggest mean slightly below 15 days in all 3
groups); suspicion that the trial included a majority of participants with analgesic abuse (28/30 used - mostly
daily - analgesics). In addition (no formal selection criteria): no usable data, group 3 received a psychological
intervention (but group 2 was a 8-week wait-list which would meet criteria); very low acupuncture scores by
both acupuncturists voting. Trial was included in 2009 version of the review
Dowson 1985
Participants: no information on duration of migraine. Trial was included in 2009 version of the review

Minor amendment to Acknowledgements section.
12 April 2016
New citation required and conclusions have changed
I. Compared to the previous version the selection cri-
teria were slightly modified, new analyses have been
added, new trials have been added and previously in-
cluded trials excluded, and conclusions for the compar-
ison with sham acupuncture were changed
II. The main search was updated on 20 January 2016
(further update searches in PubMed on 12 April 2016
and in the WHO Clinical Trials Platform 10 February
2016)
III. Five previously included trials excluded (Baust
1978; Doerr-Proske 1985; Dowson 1985; Henry 1985;
Wylie 1997), five new trials included (Facco 2013; Li
2012; Wallasch 2012; Wang 2015; Zhao 2014).
IV. The 22 trials reviewed include 4985 participants;
the 22 trials in the previous version included 4419 par-
ticipants
V. We changed the primary outcome from response
to headache frequency; added new primary analysis
time points (after treatment and follow-up instead of
four fixed time windows); and added safety/acceptabil-
ity outcomes
VI. After the inclusion of the four new sham-controlled
trials differences between true and sham acupuncture
are now statistically significant but they are small. Pre-
vious readers should re-read the update

New citation required and conclusions have changed
1) A previously published Cochrane review on
’Acupuncture for idiopathic headache’ has been split
into two reviews: the present review on ’Acupuncture
for migraine prophylaxis’, and a separate review on
’Acupuncture for tension-type headache’
2) Twelve new trials of acupuncture for migraine pro-
phylaxis are included in the present review (Alecrim
2005; Alecrim 2006; Alecrim 2008; Allais 2002; Diener
2006; Facco 2008; Jena 2008; Linde K 2005; Linde M
2000; Linde M 2005; Streng 2006; Vickers 2004)
3) Conclusions have changed as follows: In the previ-
ous version of this review, the evidence in support of
acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis was considered
promising but insufficient. Now the authors conclude
that acupuncture should be considered as a treatment
option for migraine patients needing prophylactic treat-
ment, although the available results suggest that the se-
lection of specific acupuncture points may not be as im-
portant as has been thought by providers
4) The list of review authors has been slightly amended
vis-à-vis the earlier review (D Melchart and B Berman
no longer authors; E Manheimer added as new author)
10 April 2008

KL, GA, BB, YF, MM, AV and AW participated in the revision process of the protocol for this update, the extraction and assessment
of the primary studies. EV re-analysed individual patient data included in the database of the Acupuncture Trialists’ Collaboration for
this update. All authors reviewed drafts and approved the final version of this manuscript. KL co-ordinated the review process and
wrote the draft of the review.

This review includes trials in which some of the reviewers were involved, as follows: Allais 2002 - Gianni Allais; Jena 2008 - Benno
Brinkhaus; Linde K 2005 - Benno Brinkhaus and Klaus Linde; Streng 2006 - Klaus Linde; and Vickers 2004 - Andrew Vickers. These
trials were reviewed by at least two other members of the review team.
Gianni Allais, Benno Brinkhaus, Yutong Fei, and Michael Mehring use acupuncture in their clinical work. Adrian White has used
acupuncture in the past but has retired from clinical practice.
Within the last three years (June 2013 to May 2016): Gianni Allais received fees for teaching acupuncture in private schools; Klaus
Linde once received a fee from the German Medical Acupuncture Society for speaking about research at a conference; Benno Brinkhaus
has received fees for presenting research findings at meetings of acupuncture societies in various countries; Adrian White is employed
by the British Medical Acupuncture Society as a journal editor and has received fees for lecturing on acupuncture on several occasions.

For this 2016 update we made the following changes.
The title was changed to ’Acupuncture for the prevention of episodic migraine’ (formerly ’Acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis’).
Additional subgroup analyses were performed post-hoc for the secondary outcome response to check the robustness of differences
found in the predefined subgroup analyses using the primary outcome, headache frequency.
Changes to types of participants:
• in this update of the review we have excluded trials focusing on chronic migraine, as the definition of chronic migraine is still
debated and the separation from other diagnoses, for example headache due to medication overuse, is difficult (in the previous version
of this review (Linde 2009) we were not aware of any trials on chronic migraine and they were not explicitly excluded);
• we have excluded trials in which a relevant proportion of participants had been suffering from migraine for less than one year or
in which duration was unclear.

 Changes to types of interventions: in the previous version we included trials using any prophylactic treatment other than acupuncture
as comparison. With a slowly increasing number of trials using a wide range of different treatments (mainly various herbal medicines)
we decided to concentrate on conventional prophylactic pharmacological treatment to keep the review focused. We have defined a
minimum number and frequency of acupuncture treatment sessions to ensure that treatments meet basic quality criteria.
In this update we have defined outcome measures more precisely to ensure that measurement methods meet current standards of
migraine research, and we have expanded the list of outcomes. Based on the recommendation of the statistician in our team (AV), we
have used fixed-effect models for calculating pooled estimates.
We have added ’Summary of findings’ tables, including a judgement on the quality of evidence following the GRADE approach
(GRADEpro GDT 2015; Schünemann 2011).
N O T E S
A restricted search in April 2018 did not identify any potentially relevant studies likely to change the conclusions. Therefore, this review
has now been stabilised following discussion with the authors and editors. The review will be re-assessed for updating in two years. If
appropriate, we will update the review before this date if new evidence likely to change the conclusions is published, or if standards
change substantially which necessitate major revisions
