Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a notably complex illness with a lifetime prevalence of 14%. 1 It is 
often chronic or recurrent and is thus accompanied by considerable morbidity, excess mortality, 
substantial costs, and heightened risk of suicide. 2-7 MDD is a major cause of disability worldwide. 8 We 
conducted a genome-wide association (GWA) meta-analysis in 130,664 MDD cases and 330,470 
controls, and identified 44 independent loci that met criteria for statistical significance. We present 
extensive analyses of these results which provide new insights into the nature of MDD. The genetic 
findings were associated with clinical features of MDD, and implicated prefrontal and anterior 
cingulate cortex in the pathophysiology of MDD (regions exhibiting anatomical differences between 
MDD cases and controls). Genes that are targets of antidepressant medications were strongly 
enriched for MDD association signals (P=8.5x10-10), suggesting the relevance of these findings for 
improved pharmacotherapy of MDD. Sets of genes involved in gene splicing and in creating isoforms 
were also enriched for smaller MDD GWA P-values, and these gene sets have also been implicated in 
schizophrenia and autism. Genetic risk for MDD was correlated with that for many adult and 
childhood onset psychiatric disorders. Our analyses suggested important relations of genetic risk for 
MDD with educational attainment, body mass, and schizophrenia: the genetic basis of lower 
educational attainment and higher body mass were putatively causal for MDD whereas MDD and 
schizophrenia reflected a partly shared biological etiology. All humans carry lesser or greater numbers 
of genetic risk factors for MDD, and a continuous measure of risk underlies the observed clinical 
phenotype. MDD is not a distinct entity that neatly demarcates normalcy from pathology but rather a 
useful clinical construct associated with a range of adverse outcomes and the end result of a complex 
process of intertwined genetic and environmental effects. These findings help refine and define the 
fundamental basis of MDD.  
Twin studies attribute ~40% of the variation in liability to MDD to additive genetic effects (heritability, 
ℎ"), 9 and ℎ" may be greater for recurrent, early-onset, and postpartum MDD. 10,11 GWA studies of MDD 
have had notable difficulties in identifying loci. 12 Previous findings suggest that an appropriately 
designed study should identify susceptibility loci. Direct estimates of the proportion of variance 
attributable to genome-wide SNPs (SNP heritability, ℎ#$%
"
) indicate that around a quarter of the ℎ" for 
MDD is due to common genetic variants. 13,14 Although there were no significant findings in the initial 
Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) MDD mega-analysis (9,240 MDD cases) 15 or in the CHARGE 
meta-analysis of depressive symptoms (34,549 respondents), 16 more recent studies have proven 
modestly successful. A study of Han Chinese women (5,303 MDD cases) identified two genome-wide 
significant loci, 17 a meta-analysis of depressive symptoms (161,460 individuals) identified two loci, 18 
and an analysis of self-reported MDD identified 15 loci (75,607 cases). 19  
There are many reasons why identifying causal loci for MDD has proven difficult. 12 MDD is probably 
influenced by many genetic loci each with small effects, 20 as are most common complex human 
diseases 21 including psychiatric disorders. 22,23 A major lesson in human complex trait genetics is that

large samples are essential, especially for common and etiologically heterogeneous illnesses like MDD. 24 
We sought to accumulate a large sample to identify common genetic variation involved in the etiology 
of MDD. 24  
Analysis of MDD anchor with six expanded cohorts shows polygenic prediction & clinical relevance 
We defined an “anchor” cohort of 29 samples that mostly applied standard methods for assessing MDD 
(Table S1). MDD cases in the anchor cohort were traditionally ascertained and typically characterized 
(i.e., using direct interviews with structured diagnostic instruments). We identified six “expanded” 
cohorts that used alternative methods to identify MDD (Table S2; deCODE, Generation Scotland, GERA, 
iPSYCH, UK Biobank, and 23andMe, Inc.). All seven cohorts focused on clinically-significant MDD. We 
evaluated the comparability of these cohorts (Table S3) by estimating the common-variant genetic 
correlations (&
') of the anchor cohort with the expanded cohorts. These analyses strongly supported the 
comparability of the seven cohorts (Table S4) as the weighted mean &
' was 0.76 (SE 0.028) with no 
statistical evidence of heterogeneity in the &
' estimates (P=0.13). As a benchmark for the MDD &
' 
estimates, the weighted mean &
' between schizophrenia cohorts was 0.84 (SE 0.05). 13  
We completed a GWA meta-analysis of 9.6 million imputed SNPs in seven cohorts containing 130,664 
MDD cases and 330,470 controls (Figure 1; full details in Online Methods). There was no evidence of 
uncontrolled inflation (LD score regression intercept 1.018, SE 0.009). We estimated ℎ#$%
"
 to be 8.9% (SE 
0.004, liability scale, assuming lifetime population risk of 0.15), and this is around a quarter of ℎ" 
estimated from twin or family studies. 9 This fraction is somewhat lower than that of other complex 
traits, 21 and is plausibly due to etiological heterogeneity.  
We used genetic risk score (GRS) analyses to demonstrate the validity of our GWA results for clinical 
MDD (Figure 2). As expected, the variance explained in out-of-sample prediction increased with the size 
of the GWA discovery cohort (Figure 2a). Across all samples in the anchor cohort, GRS explained 1.9% of 
variance in liability (Figure S1a), GRS ranked cases higher than controls with probability 0.57, and the 
odds ratio of MDD for those in the 10th versus 1st GRS decile (OR10) was 2.4 (Figure 2b, Table S5). GRS 
were significantly higher in those with more severe MDD, as measured in different ways (Figure 2c).  
Implications of the individual loci for the biology of MDD 
Our meta-analysis of seven MDD cohorts identified 44 independent loci that were statistically significant 
(P<5x10-8), statistically independent of any other signal, 25 supported by multiple SNPs, and showed 
consistent effects across cohorts. This number is consistent with our prediction that MDD GWA 
discovery would require about five times more cases than for schizophrenia (lifetime risk ~1% and 
ℎ"~0.8) to achieve approximately similar power. 26 Of these 44 loci, 30 are novel and 14 were significant 
in a prior study of MDD or depressive symptoms (the overlap of our findings: 1/1 with the CHARGE 
depressive symptom study, 16 0/2 overlap with CONVERGE MDD study, 17 1/2 overlap with the SSGAC 
depressive symptom study, 18 and 13/16 overlap with 23andMe self-report of MDD 19 ). There are few 
trans-ancestry comparisons for MDD so we contrasted these European results with the Han Chinese 
CONVERGE study (Online Methods).  
Table 1 lists genes in or near the lead SNP in each region, regional plots are in the Supplemental File, 
and Table S6 provides extensive summaries of available information about the biological functions of 
the genes in each region. In nine of the 44 loci, the lead SNP is within a gene, there is no other gene 
within 200 kb, and the gene is known to play a role in neuronal development, synaptic function, 
transmembrane adhesion complexes, and/or regulation of gene expression in brain.  
The two most significant SNPs are located in or near OLFM4 and NEGR1, which were previously 
associated with obesity and body mass index. 27-32 OLFM4 (olfactomedin 4) has diverse functions outside

the CNS including myeloid precursor cell differentiation, innate immunity, anti-apoptotic effects, gut 
inflammation, and is over-expressed in diverse common cancers. 33 Many olfactomedins also have roles 
in neurodevelopment and synaptic function; 34 e.g., latrophilins form trans-cellular complexes with 
neurexins 35 and with FLRT3 to regulate glutamatergic synapse number. 36 Olfm4 was highly upregulated 
after spinal transection, possibly related to inhibition of subsequent neurite outgrowth. 37 NEGR1 
(neuronal growth regulator 1) influences axon extension and synaptic plasticity in cortex, hypothalamus, 
and hippocampus, 38-40 and modulates synapse formation in hippocampus 41,42 via regulation of neurite 
outgrowth. 43,44 High expression, modulated by nutritional state, is seen in brain areas relevant to 
feeding, suggesting a role in control of energy intake. 45 The same SNP alleles are associated with 
increased risk of obesity and MDD (see also Mendelian randomization analyses below) and are 
associated with NEGR1 gene expression in brain (Table S6). The associated SNPs may tag two upstream 
common deletions (8 and 43 kb) that delete transcription factor binding sites, 46 although reports differ 
on whether the signal is driven by the shorter 27 or the longer deletion. 31 Thus, the top two associations 
are in or near genes that influence BMI and may be involved in neurite outgrowth and synaptic 
plasticity.  
Novel associations reported here include RBFOX1 and LRFN5. There are independent associations with 
MDD at both the 5’ and the 3’ ends of RBFOX1 (1.7 Mb, RNA binding protein fox-1 homolog 1). This 
convergence makes it a strong candidate gene. Fox-1 regulates the expression of thousands of genes, 
many of which are expressed at synapses and enriched for autism-related genes. 47 The Fox-1 network 
regulates neuronal excitability and prevents seizures. 48 It directs splicing in the nucleus and binds to 3ʹ 
UTRs of target mRNAs in the cytoplasm. 48,49 Of particular relevance to MDD, Fox-1 participates in the 
termination of the corticotropin releasing hormone response to stress by promoting alternative splicing 
of the PACAP receptor to its repressive form. 50 Thus, RBFOX1 could play a role in the chronic 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivation that has been widely reported in MDD. 51  
LRFN5 (leucine rich repeat and fibronectin type III domain containing 5) encodes adhesion-like 
molecules involved in synapse formation. Common SNPs in LRFN5 were associated with depressive 
symptoms in older adults in a gene-based GWA analysis. 52 LRFN5 induces excitatory and inhibitory 
presynaptic differentiation in contacting axons and regulates synaptic strength. 53,54 LRFN5 also limits T-
cell response and neuroinflammation (CNS “immune privilege”) by binding to herpes virus entry 
mediator; a LRFN5-specific monoclonal antibody increases activation of microglia and macrophages by 
lipopolysaccharide and exacerbates mouse experimental acquired encephalitis; 55 thus, reduced 
expression (the predicted effect of eQTLs in LD with the associated SNPs) could increase 
neuroinflammatory responses.  
Gene-wise analyses identified 153 significant genes after controlling for multiple comparisons (Table 
S7). Many of these genes were in the extended MHC region (45 of 153) and their interpretation is 
complicated by high LD and gene density. In addition to the genes discussed above, other notable and 
significant genes outside of the MHC include multiple potentially “druggable” targets that suggest 
connections of the pathophysiology of MDD to neuronal calcium signaling (CACNA1E and CACNA2D1), 
dopaminergic 
neurotransmission 
(DRD2, 
a 
principal 
target 
of 
antipsychotics), 
glutamate 
neurotransmission (GRIK5 and GRM5), and presynaptic vesicle trafficking (PCLO).  
Finally, comparison of the MDD loci with 108 loci for schizophrenia 22 identified six shared loci. Many 
SNPs in the extended MHC region are strongly associated with schizophrenia, but implication of the 
MHC region is novel for MDD. Another example is TCF4 (transcription factor 4) which is strongly 
associated with schizophrenia but not previously with MDD. TCF4 is essential for normal brain 
development, and rare mutations in TCF4 cause Pitt–Hopkins syndrome which includes autistic features.

56 GRS calculated from the schizophrenia GWA results explained 0.8% of the variance in liability of MDD 
(Figure 2c).  
Implications for the biology of MDD using functional genomic data 
Results from “-omic” studies of functional features of cells and tissues are necessary to understand the 
biological implications of results of GWA for complex disorders like MDD. 57 To further elucidate the 
biological relevance of the MDD findings, we integrated the results with a wide range of functional 
genomic data. First, using enrichment analyses, we compared the MDD GWA findings to bulk tissue 
mRNA-seq from GTEx. 58 Only brain samples showed significant enrichment (Figure 3A), and the three 
tissues with the most significant enrichments were all cortical. Prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate 
cortex are important for higher-level executive functions and emotional regulation which are often 
impaired in MDD. Both regions were implicated in a large meta-analysis of brain MRI findings in adult 
MDD cases. 59 Second, given the predominance of neurons in cortex, we confirmed that the MDD 
genetic findings connect to genes expressed in neurons but not oligodendrocytes or astrocytes (Figure 
3B). 60 These results confirm that MDD is a brain disorder and provide validation for the utility of our 
genetic results for the etiology of MDD.  
Third, we used partitioned LD score regression 61 to evaluate the enrichment of the MDD GWA findings 
in over 50 functional genomic annotations (Figure 3C and Table S8). The major finding was the 
significant enrichment of MDD ℎ#$%
"
 in genomic regions conserved across 29 Eutherian mammals 62 
(20.9 fold enrichment, P=1.4x10-15). This annotation was also the most enriched for schizophrenia. 61 We 
could not evaluate regions conserved in primates or human “accelerated” regions as there were too few 
for confident evaluation. 62 The other major enrichments implied regulatory activity, and included open 
chromatin in human brain and an epigenetic mark of active enhancers (H3K4me1). Notably, exonic 
regions did not show enrichment suggesting that, as with schizophrenia, 20 genetic variants that change 
exonic sequences may not play a large role in MDD. We found no evidence that Neanderthal 
introgressed regions were enriched for MDD GWA findings. 63  
Fourth, we applied methods to integrate GWA SNP-MDD results with those from gene expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies. SMR (summary data–based Mendelian randomization) 64 identified 
13 MDD-associated SNPs with strong evidence that they control local gene expression in one or more 
tissues (Table S9 and Figure S2), including two loci not reaching GWA significance (TMEM64 and 
ZDHHC5). A transcriptome-wide association study 65 applied to data from the dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex 66 identified 17 genes where MDD-associated SNPs influenced gene expression (Table S10). These 
genes included OLFM4 (discussed above).  
Fifth, we added additional data types to attempt to improve understanding of individual loci. For the 
intergenic associations, we evaluated total-stranded RNA-seq data from human brain and found no 
evidence for unannotated transcripts in these regions. A particularly important data type is assessment 
of DNA-DNA interactions which can localize a GWA finding to a specific gene that may be nearby or 
hundreds of kb away. 67-69 We integrated the MDD findings with “easy Hi-C” data from brain cortical 
samples (3 adult, 3 fetal, more than 1 billion reads each). These data clarified three of the associations.  
The statistically independent associations in NEGR1 (rs1432639, P=4.6x10-15) and over 200 kb away 
(rs12129573, P=4.0x10-12) both implicate NEGR1 (Figure S3a), the former likely due to the presence of a 
reportedly functional copy number polymorphism (see above) and the presence of intergenic loops. The 
latter association has evidence of DNA looping interactions with NEGR1. The association in SOX5 
(rs4074723) and the two statistically independent associations in RBFOX1 (rs8063603 and rs7198928, 
P=6.9x10-9 and 1.0x10-8) had only intragenic associations, suggesting that the genetic variation in the 
regions of the MDD associations act locally and can be assigned to these genes. In contrast, the

association in RERE (rs159963 P=3.2x10-8) could not be assigned to RERE as it may contain super-
enhancer elements given its many DNA-DNA interactions with many nearby genes (Figure S3b).  
Implications for the biology of MDD based on the roles of sets of genes 
A parsimonious explanation for the presence of many significant associations for a complex trait like 
MDD is that the different associations are part of a higher order grouping of genes. 70 These could be a 
biological pathway or a collection of genes with a functional connection. Multiple methods allow 
evaluation of the connection of MDD GWA results to sets of genes grouped by empirical or predicted 
function (i.e., pathway or gene set analysis).  
Full pathway analyses are shown in Table S11, and the 19 pathways with false discovery rate q-values < 
0.05 are summarized in Figure 4. The major groupings of significant pathways were: RBFOX1, RBFOX2, 
RBFOX3, or CELF4 regulatory networks; genes whose mRNAs are bound by FMRP; synaptic genes; genes 
involved in neuronal morphogenesis; genes involved in neuron projection; genes associated with 
schizophrenia (at P<10-4) 22; genes involved in CNS neuron differentiation; genes encoding voltage-gated 
calcium channels; genes involved in cytokine and immune response; and genes known to bind to the 
retinoid X receptor. Several of these pathways are implicated by GWA of schizophrenia and by rare 
exonic variation of schizophrenia and autism, 71,72 and immediately suggest shared biological 
mechanisms across these disorders.  
A key issue for common variant GWA studies is their relevance for pharmacotherapy: do the results 
connect meaningfully to known medication targets and might they suggest new mechanisms or 
“druggable” targets? We conducted gene set analysis that compared the MDD GWA results to targets of 
antidepressant medications defined by pharmacological studies, 73 and found that 42 sets of genes 
encoding proteins bound by antidepressant medications were highly enriched for smaller MDD 
association P-values than expected by chance (42 drugs, rank enrichment test P=8.5x10-10). This finding 
connects our MDD genomic findings to MDD therapeutics, and suggests the salience of these results for 
novel lead compound discovery for MDD. 74  
Implications for a deeper understanding of the clinically-defined entity “MDD” 
Past epidemiological studies associated MDD with many other diseases and traits. Due to limitations 
inherent to observational studies, understanding whether a phenotypic correlation is potentially causal 
or if it results from reverse causation or confounding is generally unclear. Genetic studies can now offer 
complementary strategies to assess whether a phenotypic association between MDD and a risk factor or 
a comorbidity is mirrored by a non-zero &
' (common variant genetic correlation) and, for some of these, 
evaluate the potential causality of the association given that exposure to genetic risk factors begins at 
conception.  
We used LD score regression to estimate &
' of MDD with 221 psychiatric disorders, medical diseases, 
and human traits. 14,75 Table S12 contains the full results, and Table 2 holds the &
' values with false 
discovery rates < 0.01. First, there were very high genetic correlations for MDD with current depressive 
symptoms. Both correlations were close to +1 (the samples in one report overlapped partially with this 
MDD meta-analysis 18 but the other did not 16). The &
' estimate in the MDD anchor samples with 
depressive symptoms was numerically smaller (0.80, SE 0.059) but the confidence intervals overlapped 
those for the full sample. Thus, the common-variant genetic architecture of lifetime MDD overlapped 
strongly with that of current depressive symptoms (bearing in mind that current symptoms had lower 
estimates of ℎ#$%

 compared to the lifetime measure of MDD).

well as with smoking initiation. This is the most comprehensive and best-powered evaluation of the

relation of MDD with other psychiatric disorders yet published, and these results indicate that the 
common genetic variants that predispose to MDD overlap substantially with those for adult and 
childhood onset psychiatric disorders.  
Third, MDD had positive genetic correlations with multiple measures of sleep quality (daytime 
sleepiness, insomnia, and tiredness). The first two of these correlations were based on a specific analysis 
of UK Biobank data (i.e., removing people with MDD, other major psychiatric disorders, shift workers, 
and those taking hypnotics). This pattern of correlations combined with the critical importance of sleep 
and fatigue in MDD (these are two commonly accepted criteria for MDD) suggests a close and 
potentially profound mechanistic relation. MDD also had a strong genetic correlation with neuroticism 
(a personality dimension assessing the degree of emotional instability); this is consistent with the 
literature showing a close interconnection of MDD and this personality trait. The strong negative &
' with 
subjective well-being underscores the capacity of MDD to impact human health.  
Finally, MDD had negative correlations with two proxy measures of intelligence, positive correlations 
with multiple measures of adiposity, relationship to female reproductive behavior (decreased age at 
menarche, age at first birth, and increased number of children), and positive correlations with coronary 
artery disease and lung cancer.  
We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the relationships between genetically correlated 
traits. We conducted bi-directional MR analysis for four traits: years of education (EDY, a proxy for 
general intelligence) 76, body mass index (BMI) 27, coronary artery disease (CAD) 77, and schizophrenia 22. 
These traits were selected because all of the following were true: phenotypically associated with MDD, 
significant &
' with MDD with an unclear direction of causality, and >30 independent genome-wide 
significant associations from large GWA.  
We report GSMR (generalized summary statistic-based MR) results but obtained qualitatively similar 
results with other MR methods (Table S13 and Figures S4A-D). MR analyses provided evidence for a 
1.15-fold increase in MDD per standard deviation of BMI (PGSMR=2.7x10-7) and a 0.89-fold decrease in 
MDD per standard deviation of EDY (PGSMR=8.8x10-7). There was no evidence of reverse causality of MDD 
for BMI (PGSMR=0.81) or EDY (PGSMR=0.28). For BMI there was some evidence of pleiotropy, as eight SNPs 
were excluded by the HEIDI-outlier test including SNPs near OLFM4 and NEGR1 (if these were included, 
the estimate of increased risk for MDD was greater). Thus, these results are consistent with EDY and 
BMI as causal risk factors or correlated with causal risk factors for MDD. For CAD, the MR analyses were 
not significant when considering MDD as an outcome (PGSMR=0.39) or as an exposure (PGSMR=0.13). We 
interpret the &
' of 0.12 between CAD and MDD to reflect a genome-wide correlation in the sign of effect 
sizes but no correlation in the effect size magnitudes: this is consistent with “type I pleiotropy” 78, that 
there are multiple molecular functions of these genetic variants (which may be tissue-specific in brain 
and heart). However, because the MR regression coefficient for MDD instruments has relatively high 
standard error, this analysis should be revisited when more MDD genome-wide significant SNP 
instruments become available from future MDD GWA studies.  
We used MR to investigate the relationship between MDD and schizophrenia. Although MDD had 
positive &
' with many psychiatric disorders, only schizophrenia has sufficient associations for MR 
analyses. We found significant bi-directional correlations in SNP effect sizes for schizophrenia loci in 
MDD (PGSMR=7.7x10-46) and for MDD loci in schizophrenia (PGSMR=6.3x10-15). We interpret the MDD-
schizophrenia &
' of 0.34 as reflecting type II pleiotropy 78 (i.e., consistent with shared biological 
pathways being causal for both disorders).

Empirically, what is MDD? 
The nature of severe depression has been discussed for millennia. 79 This GWA meta-analysis is among 
the largest ever conducted for a psychiatric disorder, and provides a body of results that help refine and 
define the fundamental basis of MDD.  
First, MDD is a brain disorder. Although this is not unexpected, some past models of MDD have had little 
or no place for heredity or biology. Our results indicate that genetics and biology are definite pieces in 
the puzzle of MDD. The genetic results best match gene expression patterns in prefrontal and anterior 
cingulate cortex, anatomical regions that show differences between MDD cases and controls. The 
genetic findings implicated neurons (not microglia or astrocytes), and we anticipate more detailed 
cellular localization when sufficient single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-seq datasets become available. 80  
Second, the genetic associations for MDD (as with schizophrenia) 61 tend to occur in genomic regions 
conserved across a range of placental mammals. Conservation suggests important functional roles. 
Given that this analysis did not implicate exons or coding regions, MDD may not be characterized by 
common changes in the amino acid content of proteins.  
Third, the results also implicated developmental gene regulatory processes. For instance, the genetic 
findings pointed at RBFOX1 (the presence of two independent genetic associations in RBFOX1 strongly 
suggests that it is the MDD-relevant gene). Gene set analyses implicated genes containing binding sites 
to the protein product of RBFOX1 in MDD, and this gene set is also significantly enriched for rare exonic 
variation in autism and schizophrenia. 71,72 These analyses highlight the potential importance of splicing 
to generate alternative isoforms; risk for MDD may be mediated not by changes in isolated amino acids 
but rather by changes in the proportions of isoforms coming from a gene, given that isoforms often have 
markedly different biological functions. 81,82 These convergent results provide a tantalizing suggestion of 
a biological mechanism common to multiple severe psychiatric disorders.  
Fourth, in the most extensive analysis of the genetic “connections” of MDD with a wide range of 
disorders, diseases, and human traits, we found significant positive genetic correlations with measures 
of body mass and negative genetic correlations with years of education. MR analyses suggested the 
potential causality of both correlations, and our results certainly provide hypotheses for more detailed 
prospective studies. However, further clarity requires larger and more informative GWA studies for a 
wider range of related traits (e.g., with >30 significant associations per trait). We strongly caution 
against interpretations of these results that go beyond the analyses undertaken (e.g., these results do 
not provide evidence that weight loss would have an antidepressant effect). The currently available data 
do not provide further insight about the fundamental driver or drivers of causality. The underlying 
mechanisms are likely more complex as it is difficult to envision how genetic variation in educational 
attainment or body mass alters risk for MDD without invoking an additional mechanistic component. For 
example, genetic variation underlying general intelligence might directly alter the development and 
function of discrete brain regions that alters intelligence and which also predisposes to worse mood 
regulation. Alternatively, genetic variation underlying general intelligence might lead to poorer 
development of cognitive strategies to handle adversity which increases risk for MDD. An additional 
possibility is that there are sets of correlated traits–e.g., personality, intelligence, sleep patterns, 
appetitive regulation, or propensity to exercise–and that these act in varying combinations in different 
people. Our results are inconsistent with a causal relation between MDD and subsequent changes in 
body mass or education years. If such associations are observed in epidemiological or clinical samples, 
then it is likely not MDD but something correlated with MDD that drives the association.  
Fifth, we found significant positive correlations of MDD with all psychiatric disorders that we evaluated, 
including disorders prominent in childhood. This pattern of results indicates that the current

classification scheme for major psychiatric disorders does not align well with the underlying genetic 
basis of these disorders. The MR results for MDD and schizophrenia indicated a shared biological basis.  
The dominant psychiatric nosological systems were principally designed for clinical utility, and are based 
on data that emerge during human interactions (i.e., observable signs and reported symptoms) and not 
objective measurements of pathophysiology. MDD is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric 
disorders, and the phenotypic comorbidity has an underlying structure that reflects shared origins (as 
inferred from factor analyses and twin studies). 83-86 Our genetic results add to this knowledge: MDD is 
not a discrete entity at any level of analysis. Rather, our data strongly suggest the existence of biological 
processes common to MDD and schizophrenia. It would be unsurprising if future work implicated bipolar 
disorder, anxiety disorders, and other psychiatric disorders as well.  
Finally, as expected, we found that MDD had modest ℎ#$%
"
 (8.9%) since MDD is a complex malady with 
both genetic and environmental determinants. We found that MDD has a very high genetic correlation 
with proxy measures that can be briefly assessed. Lifetime major depressive disorder requires a 
constellation of signs and symptoms whose reliable scoring requires an extended interview with a 
trained clinician. However, the common variant genetic architecture of lifetime major depressive 
disorder in these seven cohorts (containing many subjects medically treated for MDD) has strong 
overlap with that of current depressive symptoms in general community samples. Similar relations of 
clinically-defined ADHD or autism with quantitative genetic variation in the population have been 
reported. 87,88 The MDD “disorder versus symptom” relationship has been debated extensively, 89 but 
our data indicate that the common variant genetic overlap is very high. This finding has two important 
implications.  
One implication is for future genetic studies of MDD. In a first phase, it should be possible to elucidate 
the bulk of the common variant genetic architecture of MDD using a cost-effective shortcut – large 
studies of genotyped individuals who complete brief lifetime MDD screening (a sample size approaching 
1 million MDD cases may be achievable by 2020). In a second phase, with a relatively complete 
understanding of the genetic basis of MDD, one could then evaluate smaller samples of carefully 
phenotyped individuals with MDD to understand the clinical importance of the genetic results. These 
data could allow more precise delineation of the clinical heterogeneity of MDD (e.g., our demonstration 
that individuals with more severe or recurrent MDD have inherited a higher genetic loading for MDD 
than single-episode MDD). Subsequent empirical studies may show that it is possible to stratify MDD 
cases at first presentation to identify individuals at high risk for recurrence, poor outcome, poor 
treatment response, or who might subsequently develop a psychiatric disorder requiring alternative 
pharmacotherapy (e.g., schizophrenia or bipolar disorder). This could form a cornerstone of precision 
medicine in psychiatry.  
The second implication is that people with MDD differ only by degree from those who have not 
experienced MDD. All humans carry lesser or greater numbers of genetic risk factors for MDD. Genetic 
risk for MDD is continuous and normally distributed with no clear point of demarcation. Non-genetic 
factors play important protective and pre-disposing roles (e.g., life events, exposure to chronic fear, 
substance abuse, and a wide range of life experiences and choices). The relation of blood pressure to 
essential hypertension is a reasonable analogy. All humans inherit different numbers of genetic variants 
that influence long-term patterns of blood pressure with environmental exposures and life choices also 
playing roles. The medical “disorder” of hypertension is characterized by blood pressure chronically over 
a numerical threshold above which the risks for multiple preventable diseases climb. MDD is not a 
“disease” (i.e., a distinct entity delineable using an objective measure of pathophysiology) but indeed a 
disorder, a human-defined but definable syndrome that carries increased risk of adverse outcomes. The 
adverse outcomes of hypertension are diseases (e.g., stroke or myocardial infarction). The adverse

outcomes of MDD include elevation in risk for a few diseases, but the major impacts of MDD are death 
by suicide and disability.  
In summary, this GWA meta-analysis of 130,664 MDD cases and 330,470 controls identified 44 loci. An 
extensive set of companion analyses provide insights into the nature of MDD as well as its neurobiology, 
therapeutic relevance, and genetic and biological interconnections to other psychiatric disorders. 
Comprehensive elucidation of these features is the primary goal of our genetic studies of MDD.  
 
Online Methods 
Anchor cohort. Our analysis was anchored in a GWA mega-analysis of 29 samples of European-ancestry 
(16,823 MDD cases and 25,632 controls). Table S1 summarizes the source and inclusion/exclusion 
criteria for cases and controls for each sample. All samples in the initial PGC MDD papers were included. 
13,15,90 All anchor samples passed a structured methodological review by MDD assessment experts (DF 
Levinson and KS Kendler). Cases were required to meet international consensus criteria (DSM-IV, ICD-9, 
or ICD-10) 91-93 for a lifetime diagnosis of MDD established using structured diagnostic instruments from 
assessments by trained interviewers, clinician-administered checklists, or medical record review. All 
cases met standard criteria for MDD, were directly interviewed (28/29 samples) or had medical record 
review by an expert diagnostician (1/29 samples), and most were ascertained from clinical sources 
(19/29 samples). Controls in most samples were screened for the absence of lifetime MDD (22/29 
samples), and randomly selected from the population. We considered this the “anchor” cohort given use 
of standard methods of establishing the presence or absence of MDD.  
The most direct and important way to evaluate the comparability of the samples comprising the anchor 
cohort is using SNP genotype data. 14,94 The sample sizes were too small to evaluate the common variant 
genetic correlations (&
') between all pairs of anchor cohort samples (>3,000 subjects per sample are 
recommended). As an alternative, we used “leave one out” genetic risk scores (GRS, described below). 
We repeated this procedure by leaving out each of the anchor cohort samples so that we could evaluate 
the similarity of the common-variant genetic architectures of each sample to the rest of the anchor 
cohort. Figure S1A shows that all samples in the anchor cohort (except one) yielded significant 
differences in case-control distributions of GRS.  
Expanded cohorts. We critically evaluated an “expanded” set of six independent, European-ancestry 
cohorts (113,841 MDD cases and 304,838 controls). Table S2 summarizes the source and 
inclusion/exclusion criteria for cases and controls for each cohort. These cohorts used a range of 
methods for assessing MDD: Generation Scotland employed direct interviews; iPSYCH (Denmark) used 
national treatment registers; deCODE (Iceland) used national treatment registers and direct interviews; 
GERA used Kaiser-Permanente treatment records (CA, US); UK Biobank combined self-reported MDD 
symptoms and/or treatment for MDD by a medical professional; and 23andMe used self-report of 
treatment for MDD by a medical professional. All controls were screened for the absence of MDD.  
Cohort comparability. Table S3 summarizes the numbers of cases and controls in the anchor cohort and 
the six expanded cohorts. The most direct and important way to evaluate the comparability of these 
cohorts for a GWA meta-analysis is using SNP genotype data. 14,94 We used LD score regression 
(described below) to estimate ℎ#$%
"
 for each cohort, and &
' for all pairwise combinations of the cohorts.  
We compared the seven anchor and expanded cohorts. First, there was no indication of important 
sample overlap as the LDSC regression intercept between pairs of cohorts ranged from -0.01 to +0.01. 
Second, Table S4 shows ℎ#$%
"
 on the liability scale for each cohort. The ℎ#$%
"
 estimates range from 0.09 
to 0.23 (for lifetime risk (=0.15) but the confidence intervals largely overlap. Third, Table S4 also shows

the &

' was 0.80 (interquartile range 
0.67-0.96), and the upper 95% confidence interval on &
' included 0.75 for all pairwise comparisons. 
These results indicate that the common variant genetic architecture of the anchor and expanded 
cohorts overlap strongly, and provide critical support for the full meta-analysis of all cohorts.  
Genotyping and quality control. Genotyping procedures can be found in the primary reports for each 
cohort (Tables S1-S2). Individual genotype data for all anchor cohorts, GERA, and iPSYCH were 
processed using the PGC “ricopili” pipeline (URLs) for standardized quality control, imputation, and 
analysis. 22 The expanded cohorts from deCODE, Generation Scotland, UK Biobank, and 23andMe were 
processed by the collaborating research teams using comparable procedures. SNPs and insertion-
deletion polymorphisms were imputed using the 1000 Genomes Project multi-ancestry reference panel 
(URLs).95  
Quality control and imputation on the 29 PGC MDD anchor cohorts was performed according to 
standards from the PGC (Table S3). The default parameters for retaining SNPs and subjects were: SNP 
missingness < 0.05 (before sample removal); subject missingness < 0.02; autosomal heterozygosity 
deviation (|Fhet|<0.2); SNP missingness < 0.02 (after sample removal); difference in SNP missingness 
between cases and controls < 0.02; and SNP Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > 10−6 in controls or P > 
10−10 in cases). These default parameters sufficiently controlled l and false positive findings for 16 
cohorts (boma, rage, shp0, shpt, edi2, gens, col3, mmi2, qi3c, qi6c, qio2, rai2, rau2, twg2, grdg, grnd). 
Two cohorts (gep3 and nes2) needed stricter SNP filtering and 11 cohorts needed additional ancestral 
matching (rot4, stm2, rde4) or ancestral outlier exclusion (rad2, i2b3, gsk1, pfm2, jjp2, cof3, roc3, 
mmo4). An additional cohort of inpatient MDD cases from Münster, Germany was processed through 
the same pipeline. 
Genotype imputation was performed using the pre-phasing/imputation stepwise approach 
implemented in IMPUTE2 / SHAPEIT (chunk size of 3 Mb and default parameters). The imputation 
reference set consisted of 2,186 phased haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project dataset (August 
2012, 30,069,288 variants, release “v3.macGT1”). After imputation, we identified SNPs with very high 
imputation quality (INFO >0.8) and low missingness (<1%) for building the principal components to be 
used as covariates in final association analysis. After linkage disequilibrium pruning (r2 > 0.02) and 
frequency filtering (MAF > 0.05), there were 23,807 overlapping autosomal SNPs in the data set. This 
SNP set was used for robust relatedness testing and population structure analysis. Relatedness testing 
identified pairs of subjects with ) > 0.2, and one member of each pair was removed at random after 
preferentially retaining cases over controls. Principal component estimation used the same collection of 
autosomal SNPs.  
Identification of identical samples is easily accomplished given direct access to individual genotypes. 13 
Two concerns are the use of the same control samples in multiple studies (e.g., GAIN or WTCCC controls) 
96,97 and inclusion of closely related individuals. For cohorts where the PGC central analysis team had 
access to individual genotypes (all anchor cohorts and GERA), we used SNPs directly genotyped on all 
platforms to compute empirical relatedness, and excluded one of each duplicated or relative pair 
(defined as ) > 0.2). Within all other cohorts (deCODE, Generation Scotland, iPSYCH, UK Biobank, 
23andMe, and CONVERGE), identical and relative pairs were identified and resolved using similar 
procedures. Identical samples between the anchor cohorts, iPSYCH, UK Biobank, and Generation 
Scotland were identified using genotype-based checksums (URLs), 98 and an individual on the 
collaborator’s side was excluded. Checksums were not available for the deCODE and 23andMe cohorts. 
Related pairs are not detectable by the checksum method but we did not find evidence of important 
overlap using LD score regression (the intercept between pairs of cohorts ranged from -0.01 to +0.01 
with no evidence of important sample overlap).

Statistical analysis. In each cohort, logistic regression association tests were conducted for imputed 
marker dosages with principal components covariates to control for population stratification. Ancestry 
was evaluated using principal components analysis applied to directly genotyped SNPs. 99 In the anchor 
cohorts and GERA, we determined that all individuals in the final analyses were of European ancestry. 
European ancestry was confirmed in the other expanded cohorts by the collaborating research teams 
using similar procedures. We tested 20 principal components for association with MDD and included 
five principal components covariates for the anchor cohorts and GERA (all other cohorts adopted similar 
strategies). There was no evidence of stratification artifacts or uncontrolled test statistic inflation in the 
results from each anchor and extended cohort (e.g., lGC was 0.995–1.043 in the anchor cohorts). The 
results were combined across samples using an inverse-weighted fixed effects model.100 Reported SNPs 
have imputation marker INFO score ≥ 0.6 and allele frequencies ≥0.01 and ≤0.99, and effective sample 
size equivalent to > 100,000 cases. For all cohorts, X-chromosome association results were conducted 
separately by sex, and then meta-analysed across sexes. 22 For two cohorts (GenScot and UKBB), we first 
conducted association analysis for genotyped SNPs by sex, then imputed association results using LD 
from the 1000 Genomes reference sample. 101  
Defining loci. GWA findings implicate genomic regions containing multiple significant SNPs (“loci”). There 
were almost 600 SNPs with P < 5x10-8 in this analysis. These are not independent associations but result 
from LD between SNPs. We collapsed the significant SNPs to 44 loci via the following steps.  
• 
All SNPs were high-quality (imputation INFO score ≥ 0.6 and allele frequencies ≥0.01 and ≤0.99).  
• 
We used “clumping” to convert MDD-associated SNPs to associated regions. We identified an 
index SNP with the smallest P-value in a genomic window and other SNPs in high LD with the 
index SNP using PLINK (--clump-p1 1e-4 --clump-p2 1e-4 --clump-r2 0.1 --clump-kb 3000). This 
retained SNPs with association P < 0.0001 and r2 < 0.1 within 3 Mb windows. Only one SNP was 
retained from the extended MHC region due to its exceptional LD.  
• 
We used bedtools (URLs) to combine partially or wholly overlapping clumps within 50 kb.  
• 
We reviewed all regional plots, and removed two singleton associations (i.e., only one SNP 
exceeding genome-wide significance).  
• 
We reviewed forest plots, and confirmed that association signals arose from the majority of the 
cohorts.  
• 
We conducted conditional analyses. To identify independent associations within a 10 Mb region, 
we re-evaluated all SNPs in a region conditioning on the most significantly associated SNP using 
summary statistics 25 (superimposing the LD structure from the Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities Study sample).  
Genetic risk score (GRS) analyses. To demonstrate the validity of our GWAS results, we conducted a 
series of GRS prediction analyses. The MDD GWA summary statistics identified associated SNP alleles 
and effect size which were used to calculate GRS for each individual in a target sample (i.e., the sum of 
the count of risk alleles weighted by the natural log of the odds ratio of the risk allele). In some analyses 
the target sample had been included as one of the 29 samples in the MDD anchor cohort; here, the 
discovery samples were meta-analyzed excluding this cohort. As in the PGC schizophrenia report, 22 we 
excluded uncommon SNPs (MAF < 0.1), low-quality variants (imputation INFO < 0.9), indels, and SNPs in 
the extended MHC region (chr6:25-34 Mb). We then LD pruned and “clumped” the data, discarding 
variants within 500 kb of, and in LD r2 > 0.1 with the most associated SNP in the region. We generated 
GRS for individuals in target subgroups for a range of P-value thresholds (PT: 5x10-8, 1x10-6, 1x10-4, 0.001, 
0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0).  
For each GRS analysis, five ways of evaluating the regression of phenotype on GRS are reported (Table 
S5). The significance of the case-control score difference from logistic regression including ancestry PCs

and a study indicator (if more than one target dataset was analyzed) as covariates. 2) The proportion of 
variance explained (Nagelkerke’s R2) computed by comparison of a full model (covariates + GRS) to a 
reduced model (covariates only). It should be noted that these estimates of R2 reflect the proportion of 
cases in the case-control studies where this proportion may not reflect the underlying risk of in the 
population. 3) The proportion of variance on the liability scale explained by the GRS R2 was calculated 
from the difference between full and reduced linear models and was then converted to the liability scale 
of the population assuming lifetime MDD risk of 15%. These estimates should be comparable across 
target sample cohorts, whatever the proportion of cases in the sample. 4) Area under the receiver 
operator characteristic curve (AUC; R library pROC) was estimated in a model with no covariates 22 
where AUC can be interpreted as the probability of a case being ranked higher than a control. 5) Odds 
ratio for 10 GRS decile groups (these estimates also depend on both risk of MDD in the population and 
proportion of cases in the sample). We evaluated the impact of increasing sample size of the discovery 
sample GWA (Figure 2a) and also using the schizophrenia GWA study 22 as the discovery sample. We 
also undertook GRS analysis for a target sample of MDD cases and controls not included in the meta-
analysis (a clinical inpatient cohort of MDD cases and screened controls collected in Münster, Germany).  
We conducted GRS analyses based on prior hypotheses from epidemiology of MDD using clinical 
measures available in some cohorts (if needed, the target sample was removed from the discovery 
GWA). We used GRS constructed from PT=0.05, selected as a threshold that gave high variance explained 
across cohorts (Figure S1a). First, we used GRS analyses to test for higher mean GRS in cases with 
younger age at onset (AAO) of MDD compared to those with older AAO in the anchor cohort samples. To 
combine analyses across samples, we used within-sample standardized GRS residuals after correcting for 
ancestry principal components. Heterogeneity in AAO in the anchor samples has been noted, 102 which 
may reflect study specific definitions of AAO (e.g., age at first symptoms, first visit to general 
practitioner, or first diagnosis). Following Power et al., 102 we divided AAO into octiles within each cohort 
and combined the first three octiles into the early AAO group and the last three octiles into the late AAO 
group. Second, we tested for higher mean GRS for cases in anchor cohort samples with clinically severe 
MDD (endorsing ≥8 of 9 DSM MDD criteria) compared to those with “moderate” MDD (endorsing 5-7 of 
9 MDD criteria) following Verduijn et al. 103 Sample sizes are given in Table S3. Third, using iPSYCH as the 
target sample, we tested for higher mean GRS in recurrent MDD cases (ICD-10 F33, N=5,574) compared 
to those with single episode MDD cases (ICD-10 F32, N=12,968) in analyses that included ancestry 
principal components and genotyping batch as covariates. Finally, following Verduijn et al. 103 using the 
NESDA sample (PGC label “nes1”, an ongoing longitudinal study of depressive and anxiety disorders) as 
the target sample , we constructed clinical staging phenotypes in which cases were allocated to one of

promoters, UTRs), and functional genomic annotations constructed using data from ENCODE 104 and the 
Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium. 105 We complemented these annotations by adding introgressed 
regions from the Neanderthal genome in European populations 106 and open chromatin regions from the 
brain dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The open chromatin regions were obtained from an ATAC-seq 
experiment performed in 288 samples (N=135 controls, N=137 schizophrenia, N=10 bipolar, and N=6 
affective disorder). 107 Peaks called with MACS 108 (1% FDR) were retained if their coordinates 
overlapped in at least two samples. The peaks were re-centered and set to a fixed width of 300bp using 
the diffbind R package. 109 To prevent upward bias in heritability enrichment estimation, we added two 
categories created by expanding both the Neanderthal introgressed regions and open chromatin regions 
by 250bp on each side.  
We used LD score regression to estimate &
' between MDD and a range of other disorders, diseases, and 
human traits. 14 The intent of these comparisons was to evaluate the extent of shared common variant 
genetic architectures in order to suggest hypotheses about the fundamental genetic basis of MDD (given 
its extensive comorbidity with psychiatric and medical conditions and its association with 
anthropometric and other risk factors). Subject overlap of itself does not bias &
'. 14 These &
' are mostly 
based on studies of independent subjects and the estimates should be unbiased by confounding of 
genetic and non-genetic effects (except if there is genotype by environment correlation). When GWA 
studies include overlapping samples, &
' remains unbiased but the intercept of the LDSC regression is an 
estimate of the correlation between association statistics attributable to sample overlap. These 
calculations were done using the internal PGC GWA library and with LD-Hub (URLs). 75  
Relation of MDD GWA findings to tissue and cellular gene expression. We used partitioned LD score 
regression to evaluate which somatic tissues were enriched for MDD heritability. 110 Gene expression 
data generated using mRNA-seq from multiple human tissues were obtained from GTEx v6p (URLs). 
Genes for which <4 samples had at least one read count per million were discarded, and samples with 
<100 genes with at least one read count per million were excluded. The data were normalized, and a t-
statistic was obtained for each tissue by comparing the expression in each tissue with the expression of 
all other tissues with the exception of tissues related to the tissue of interest (e.g., brain cortex vs all 
other tissues excluding other brain samples), using sex and age as covariates. A t-statistic was also 
obtained for each tissue among its related tissue (ex: cortex vs all other brain tissues) to test which brain 
region was the most associated with MDD, also using sex and age as covariates. The top 10% of the 
genes with the most extreme t-statistic were defined as tissue specific. The coordinates for these genes 
were extended by a 100kb window and tested using LD score regression. Significance was obtained from 
the coefficient z-score, which corrects for all other categories in the baseline model.  
Lists of genes specifically expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes were obtained from 
Cahoy et al. 60 As these experiment were done in mice, genes were mapped to human orthologous 
genes using ENSEMBL. The coordinates for these genes were extended by a 100kb window and tested 
using LD score regression as for the GTEx tissue specific genes.  
We conducted eQTL look-ups of the most associated SNPs in each region and report (Table S6) GWA 
SNPs in LD (r2 > 0.8) with the top eQTLs in the following data sets: eQTLGen Consortium (lllumina arrays 
in whole blood N=14,115, in preparation), BIOS (RNA-seq in whole blood (N=2,116), 111 NESDA/NTR 
(Affymetrix arrays in whole blood, N=4,896), 112 GEUVADIS (RNA-seq in LCL (N=465), 113 Rosmap (RNA 
seq in cortex, N= 494, submitted), GTEx (RNA-seq in 44 tissues, N>70), 58 and Common Mind Consortium 
(CMC, prefrontal cortex, Sage Synapse accession syn5650509, N=467). 66  
We used summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) 64 to identify loci with strong evidence 
of causality via gene expression (Table S9). SMR analysis is limited to significant cis SNP-expression (FDR

< 0.05) and SNPs with MAF > 0.01 at a Bonferroni-corrected pSMR. Due to LD, multiple SNPs may be 
associated with the expression of a gene, and some SNPs are associated with the expression of more 
than one gene. Since the aim of SMR is to prioritize variants and genes for subsequent studies, a test for 
heterogeneity excludes regions that may harbor multiple causal loci (pHET < 0.05). SMR analyses were 
conducted using eQTLGen Consortium, GTEx (11 brain tissues), and CMC data.  
We conducted a transcriptome wide association study 65 using pre-computed expression reference 
weights for CMC data (5,420 genes with significant cis-SNP heritability) provided with the TWAS/FUSION 
software. The significance threshold was 0.05/5420.  
DNA looping using Hi-C. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9) was dissected from 
postmortem samples from three adults of European ancestry (Dr Craig Stockmeier, University of 
Mississippi Medical Center). Cerebrum from three fetal brains were obtained from the NIH 
NeuroBiobank (URLs; gestation age 17-19 weeks, African ancestry). Samples were dry homogenized to a 
fine powder using a liquid nitrogen-cooled mortar and pestle.  
We used “easy Hi-C” (in preparation) to assess DNA looping interactions. Pulverized tissue (~150 mg) 
was crosslinked with formaldehyde (1% final concentration) and the reaction quenched using glycine 
(150 mM). Samples were then lysed, Dounce homogenized, and digested using HindIII. This was 
followed by in situ ligation. Samples were cross-linked with proteinase K and purified using phenol-
chloroform. DNA was then digested with DpnII followed by purification using PCRClean DX beads (Aline 
Biosciences). The DNA products were self-ligated overnight at 16° using T4 DNA ligase. Self-ligated DNA 
waw purified with phenol-chloroform, digested with lambda exonuclease, and purified using PCRClean 
DX beads. For DNA circle re-linearization, bead-bound DNA was eluted and digested with HindIII and 
purified using PCRClean. Bead-bound DNA was eluted in 50ul nuclease free water.  
Re-linearized DNA (~50ng) was used for library generation (Illumina TruSeq protocol). Briefly, the DNA 
was end-repaired using End-it kit (Epicentre), A tailed with Klenow fragment (3ʹ–5ʹ exo–; NEB), and 
purified with PCRClean DX beads. The 4ul DNA product was mixed with 5ul of 2X quick ligase buffer, 1ul 
of 1:10 diluted annealed adapter and 0.5ul of Quick DNA T4 ligase (NEB). The ligation was done by 
incubating at room temperature for 15 minutes. DNA was purified using DX beads. Elution was done in 
14ul nuclease free water. To deep-sequence easy Hi-C libraries, we used custom TruSeq adapter in 
which the index is replaced by 6 base random sequence. Libraries were then PCR amplified and deeply 
sequenced (4-5 lanes per sample, around 1 billion reads per sample) using Illumina HiSeq4000 (2x50bp).  
Because nearly all mappable reads start with the HindIII sequence AGCTT, we trimmed the first 5 bases 
from every read and added the 6-base sequence AAGCTT to the 5’ of all reads. These read were then 
aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) using Bowtie. After mapping, we kept reads where both 
ends were exactly at HindIII cutting sites. PCR duplicates were removed. Of these HindIII pairs, we split 
reads into three classes based on their strand orientations (“same-strand”, “inward”, or “outward”). For 
cis-reads the only type of invalid cis-pairs are self-circles with two ends within the same HindIII fragment 
facing each other. We computed the total number of real cis-contact as twice the number of valid 
“same-strand” pairs. Reads from undigested HindIII sites are back-to-back read pairs next to the same 
HindIII sites facing away from each other.  
Gene-wise and pathway analysis. Our approach was guided by rigorous method comparisons conducted 
by PGC members. 70,114 P-values quantifying the degree of association of genes and gene sets with MDD 
were generated using MAGMA (v1.06). 115 MAGMA uses Brown’s method to combine SNP p-values and 
account for LD. We used ENSEMBL gene models for 19,079 genes giving a Bonferroni corrected P-value 
threshold of 2.6x10-6. Gene set P-values were obtained using a competitive analysis that tests whether 
genes in a gene set are more strongly associated with the phenotype than other gene sets. We used

European-ancestry subjects from 1,000 Genomes Project (Phase 3 v5a, MAF ≥ 0.01) 101 for the LD 
reference. The gene window used was 35 kb upstream and 10 kb downstream to include regulatory 
elements.  
Gene sets were from two main sources. First, we included gene sets previously shown to be important 
for psychiatric disorders (71 gene sets; e.g., FMRP binding partners, de novo mutations, GWAS top SNPs, 
ion channels). 72,116,117 Second, we included gene sets from MSigDB (v5.2) 118 which includes canonical 
pathways and Gene Ontology gene sets. Canonical pathways were curated from BioCarta, KEGG, 
Matrisome, Pathway Interaction Database, Reactome, SigmaAldrich, Signaling Gateway, Signal 
Transduction KE, and SuperArray. Pathways containing between 10-10K genes were included.  
To evaluate gene sets related to antidepressants, gene-sets were extracted from the Drug-Gene 
Interaction database (DGIdb v.2.0) 119 and the Psychoactive Drug Screening Program Ki DB 120 
downloaded in June 2016. The association of 3,885 drug gene-sets with MDD was estimated using 
MAGMA (v1.6). The drug gene-sets were ordered by p-value, and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was 
used to assess whether the 42 antidepressant gene-sets in the dataset (ATC code N06A in the 
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System) had a higher ranking than expected by chance.  
One issue is that some gene sets contain overlapping genes, and these may reflect largely overlapping 
results. The pathway map was constructed using the kernel generative topographic mapping algorithm 
(k-GTM) as described by Olier et al. GTM is a probabilistic alternative to Kohonen maps: the kernel 
variant is used when the input is a similarity matrix. The GTM and k-GTM algorithms are implemented in 
GTMapTool (URLs). We used the Jaccard similarity matrix of FDR-significant pathways as input for the 
algorithm, where each pathway is encoded by a vector of binary values representing the presence (1) or 
absence (0) of a gene. Parameters for the k-GTM algorithm are the square root of the number of grid 
points (k), the square root of the number of RBF functions (m), the regularization coefficient (l), the RBF 
width factor (w), and the number of feature space dimensions for the kernel algorithm (b). We set 
k=square root of the number of pathways, m=square root of k, l=1 (default), w=1 (default), and b=the 
number of principal components explaining 99.5% of the variance in the kernel matrix. The output of the 
program is a set of coordinates representing the average positions of pathways on a 2D map. The x and 
y axes represent the dimensions of a 2D latent space. The pathway coordinates and corresponding 
MAGMA P-values were used to build the pathway activity landscape using the kriging interpolation 
algorithm implemented in the R gstat package.  
Mendelian randomization (MR). 121 We used MR to investigate the relationships between MDD and 
correlated traits. Epidemiological studies show that MDD is associated with environmental and life event 
risk factors as well as multiple diseases, yet it remains unclear whether such trait outcomes are causes 
or consequences of MDD (or prodromal MDD). Genetic variants are present from birth, and hence are 
far less likely to be confounded with environmental factors than in epidemiological studies.  
We conducted bi-directional MR analysis for four traits: years of education (EDY) 76, body mass index 
(BMI) 27, coronary artery disease (CAD) 77, and schizophrenia (SCZ) 22. Briefly, we denote z as a genetic 
variant (i.e., a SNP) that is significantly associated with x, an exposure or putative causal trait for y (the 
disease/trait outcome). The effect size of x on y can be estimated using a two-step least squares (2SLS) 
122 approach: *+, = *.,/*.+., where *.+ is the estimated effect size for the SNP-trait association the 
exposure trait, and *., is the effect size estimated for the same SNP in the GWAS of the outcome trait.  
Since SNP-trait effect sizes are typically small, power is increased by using multiple associated SNPs 
which allows simultaneous investigation of pleiotropy driving the epidemiologically observed trait 
associations. Causality of the exposure trait for the outcome trait implies a consistent relationship 
between the SNP association effect sizes of the exposure associated SNPs in the outcome trait.

We used generalized summary statistics-based MR (GSMR) (Zhu et al., submitted) to estimate *+, and 
its standard error from multiple SNPs associated with the exposure trait at a genome-wide significance 
level. We conducted bi-directional GSMR analyses for each pair of traits, and report results after 
excluding SNPs that fail the HEIDI-outlier heterogeneity test (which is more conservative than excluding 
SNPs that have an outlying association likely driven by locus-specific pleiotropy). GSMR is more powerful 
than inverse-weighted MR (IVW-MR) and MR-Egger because it takes account of the sampling variation 
of both *.+ and *.,. GSMR also accounts for residual LD between the clumped SNPs. For comparison, 
we also conducted IVW-MR and MR-Egger analyses. 123  
Trans-ancestry. Common genetic risk variants for complex biomedical conditions are likely to be shared 
across ancestries. 124,125 However, lower &
' have been reported likely reflecting different LD patterns by 
ancestry. For example, European-Chinese &
' estimates were below one for ADHD (0.39, SE 0.15), 126 
rheumatoid arthritis (0.46, SE 0.06), 127 and type 2 diabetes (0.62, SE 0.09), 127 and reflect population 
differences in LD and population-specific causal variants.  
The Han Chinese CONVERGE study 17 included clinically ascertained females with severe, recurrent MDD, 
and is the largest non-European MDD GWA to date. Neither of the two genome-wide significant loci in 
CONVERGE had SNP findings ±250 kb with P < 1x10-6 in the full European results. We used LDSC with an 
ancestry-specific LD reference for within ancestry estimation, and POPCORN 127 for trans-ancestry 
estimation. In the CONVERGE sample, ℎ#$%
"
 was reported as 20-29%. 128 Its &
' with the seven European 
MDD cohorts was 0.33 (SE 0.03). 129 For comparison, &
' for CONVERGE with European results for 
schizophrenia was 0.34 (SE 0.05) and 0.45 (SE 0.07) for bipolar disorder. The weighted mean &
' between 
the CONVERGE cohort with the seven anchor and expanded cohorts using was 0.31 (SE 0.03). These &

estimates should be interpreted in light of the estimates of &
' within European MDD cohorts which are 
variable (Table S4).

Availability of results. The PGC’s policy is to make genome-wide summary results public. Summary 
statistics for a combined meta-analysis of the anchor cohort samples with five of the six expanded 
samples (deCODE, Generation Scotland, GERA, iPSYCH, and UK Biobank) are available on the PGC web 
site (URLs). Results for 10,000 SNPs for all seven cohorts are also available on the PGC web site.  
GWA summary statistics for the sixth expanded cohort (23andMe, Inc.) must be obtained separately. 
Summary statistics for the 23andMe dataset can be obtained by qualified researchers under an 
agreement with 23andMe that protects the privacy of the 23andMe participants. Please contact David 
Hinds (dhinds@23andme.com) for more information and to apply to access the data. Researchers who 
have the 23andMe summary statistics can readily recreate our results by meta-analyzing the six cohort 
results file with the Hyde et al. results file from 23andMe. 19  
Availability of genotype data for the anchor cohorts is described in Table S14. For the expanded cohorts, 
interested users should contact the lead PIs of these cohorts (which are separate from the PGC).

Figure 1: Results of GWA meta-analysis of seven cohorts for MDD. (a) Relation between adding cohorts 
and number of genome-wide significant genomic regions. Beginning with the largest cohort (1), added 
the next largest cohort (2) until all cohorts were included (7). The number next to each point shows the 
total effective sample size. (b) Quantile-quantile plot showing a marked departure from a null model of 
no associations (the y-axis is truncated at 1e-12). (c) Manhattan plot with x-axis showing genomic 
position (chr1-chr22), and the y-axis showing statistical significance as –log10(P). The red line shows the 
genome-wide significance threshold (P=5x10-8).  
Figure 2: Out-of-sample genetic risk score (GRS) prediction analyses. (a) Variance explained on the 
liability scale based on different discovery samples for three target samples: anchor cohort (16,823 cases, 
25,632 controls), iPSYCH (a nationally representative sample of 18,629 cases and 17,841 controls) and a 
clinical cohort from Münster not included in the GWA analysis (845 MDD inpatient cases, 834 controls). 
The anchor cohort is included as both discovery and target as we computed out-of-sample GRS for each 
anchor cohort sample, combined the results, and modeled case-control status as predicted by 
standardized GRS and cohort (see Online Methods). (b) Odd ratios of MDD per GRS decile relative to the 
first decile for iPSYCH and anchor cohorts. (c) MDD GRS (from out-of-sample discovery sets) were 
significantly higher in MDD cases with: earlier age at onset; more severe MDD symptoms (based on 
number of criteria endorsed); recurrent MDD compared to single episode; and chronic/unremitting MDD 
(“Stage IV” compared to “Stage II”, first-episode MDD 103). Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.  
Figure 3: Comparisons of the MDD GWA meta-analysis. (a) MDD results and enrichment in bulk tissue 
mRNA-seq from GTEx. Only brain tissues showed enrichment, and the three tissues with the most 
significant enrichments were all cortical. (b) MDD results and enrichment in three major brain cell types. 
The MDD genetic findings were enriched in neurons but not oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. (c) 
Partitioned LDSC to evaluate enrichment of the MDD GWA findings in over 50 functional genomic 
annotations (Table S8). The major finding was the significant enrichment of MDD ℎ#$%
"
 in genomic 
regions conserved across 29 Eutherian mammals. 62 Other enrichments implied regulatory activity, and 
included open chromatin in human brain and an epigenetic mark of active enhancers (H3K4me1). Exonic 
regions did not show enrichment. We found no evidence that Neanderthal introgressed regions were 
enriched for MDD GWA findings.  
Figure 4: Generative topographic mapping of the 19 significant pathway results. The average position of 
each pathway on the map is represented by a point. The map is colored by the -log10(P) obtained using 
MAGMA. The X and Y coordinates result from a kernel generative topographic mapping algorithm (GTM) 
that reduces high dimensional gene sets to a two-dimensional scatterplot by accounting for gene overlap 
between gene sets. Each point represents a gene set. Nearby points are more similar in gene overlap 
than more distant points. The color surrounding each point (gene set) indicates significance per the scale 
on the right. The significant pathways (Table S11) fall into nine main clusters as described in the text.  
Figure S1: Leave-one-out GRS analyses of the anchor cohort. (a) Per sample R2 at varying significance 
thresholds. A all samples in the anchor cohort (except one) yielded significant differences in case-control 
distributions of GRS. Across all samples in the anchor cohort, GRS explained 1.9% of variance in liability. 
(b) Relation between the number of cases and R2, showing the expected positive correlation.  
Figure S2: Regional association plots of genomic regions identified from SMR analysis of MDD GWA and 
eQTL results. SMR analysis helps to prioritize specific genes in a region of association for follow-up 
functional studies. Figures appear in the same order as the results reported in Table S9. In the top plot, 
grey dots represent the MDD GWA P-values, diamonds show P-values for probes from the SMR test, and 
triangles are probes without a cis-eQTL (at PeQTL < 5e-8). Genes that pass SMR and heterogeneity tests

(designed to remove loci with more than one causal association) are highlighted in red. The eQTL P-
values of SNPs are shown in the bottom plot.  
Figure S3: Circular plots to illustrate DNA-DNA loops. From the outside, the tracks show hg19 coordinates 
in Mb, the positions of significant MDD associations (-log10(P), outward is more significant), the names 
and positons of GENCODE genes, and the arc show significant DNA-DNA loops (q < 1e-4) from Hi-C on 
adult cortex (green) and fetal frontal cortex (blue). (a) chr1:71.5-74.1 Mb suggesting that the two 
statistically independent associations in the region both implicate NEGR1. (b) The MDD association in 
RERE, in contrast, coincides with many DNA-DNA loops and may suggest that this region contains super-
enhancer elements.  
Figure S4: Graphs depicting the SNP instruments used in Mendelian randomization analyses. Table S13 
shows the parameter estimates and significance, and these graphs show scatterplots of the instruments 
for MDD and (a) BMI, (b) years of education, (c) coronary artery disease, and (d) schizophrenia.

Shown are data for 44 genomic loci achieving genome-wide significance for MDD. Chr (chromosome) and Region (boundaries in Mb, hg19) are shown, defined 
by locations of SNPs with P<1x10-5 and LD r2 > 0.1 with the most associated SNP (lowest P-value in region, listed) whose location is given in bp. In three regions a 
second SNP fulfils the filtering criteria and these were followed up with conditional analyses: Chr1: conditional analysis selects only rs1432639 as significant, with 
P=2.0x10-4 for rs12134600 after fitting rs1432639; Chr5, conditional analysis shows two independent associations selecting rs247910 and rs10514301 as the 
most associated SNPs; and Chr10 conditional analysis selects only rs61867293 with P=8.6x10-5 for rs1021363 after conditioning on rs61867293. For each of the 
47 SNPs, there is at least 1 additional genome-wide significant SNP in the cluster of surrounding SNPs with low P-values. Chromosome X was analyzed but had no 
findings that met genome-wide significance.  
Column labels and abbreviations. A1/2 = the two alleles (or insertion-deletion); A1 was tested for association, and its OR (odds ratio) and SE (standard error) are 
shown. FreqU = frequency of A1 in controls across all cohorts. Entries in the “Prev” column indicate which of four previous studies identified genome-significant 
associations in a region. H=Hyde et al., 19 23andMe GWA of self-reported clinical depression (discovery sample overlaps with this paper); O=Okbay et al., 18 meta-
analysis of GWA of MDD, depressive symptoms, psychological well-being and neuroticism (includes many anchor cohorts from this paper); S=PGC report on 108 
schizophrenia-associated loci 22; and C=CHARGE consortium meta-analysis of depressive symptoms in primarily older adults. 16 Gene context: distances between 
the Peak SNP and the closest genes are shown. Brackets indicate that the Peak SNP was within that gene. The closest genes upstream (taking strand into 
account, as a negative number indicating distance in bp between Peak SNP and the nearest gene boundary) and downstream (positive distance in bp) are also 
shown, if there is a flanking gene within 200 kb. The name of the closest gene is bolded. Note that it is generally not known whether the associated SNPs have 
biological effects on these or other more distant genes.
