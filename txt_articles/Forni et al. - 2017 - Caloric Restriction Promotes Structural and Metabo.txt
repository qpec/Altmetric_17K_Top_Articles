In Brief
Caloric restriction significantly increases
the lifespan, but its effect on the skin is
poorly understood. Forni et al. show that
caloric restriction changes the structure
and metabolism of the skin; these
changes affect whole-body
thermoregulation.

SUMMARY
Caloric restriction (CR) is the most effective interven-
tion known to enhance lifespan, but its effect on the
skin is poorly understood. Here, we show that CR
mice display fur coat remodeling associated with
an expansion of the hair follicle stem cell (HFSC)
pool. We also find that the dermal adipocyte depot
(dWAT) is underdeveloped in CR animals. The
dermal/vennule annulus vasculature is enlarged,
and a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
switch and metabolic reprogramming in both the
dermis and the epidermis are observed. When the
fur coat is removed, CR mice display increased
energy expenditure associated with lean weight
loss and locomotion impairment. Our findings indi-
cate that CR promotes extensive skin and fur remod-
eling. These changes are necessary for thermal
homeostasis and metabolic fitness under conditions
of limited energy intake, suggesting a potential adap-
tive mechanism.
INTRODUCTION
Aging involves the progressive accumulation of deleterious
changes in cells and tissues over time, leading to increased dis-
ease and death risks as well as decreased fitness in almost all
organisms (Lo
´ pez-Otı
´n et al., 2013). Many of these age-related
changes can be prevented by caloric restriction (CR), a dietary
intervention that extends lifespan and improves healthspan in a
variety of species through the limitation of dietary calories
without a lack of essential nutrients (Sohal and Weindruch,
1996; Partridge and Gems, 2002; Roth et al., 2004). Most
mammalian studies investigating CR are conducted using labo-
ratory rodents and have uncovered multiple metabolic effects of
CR in the brain, heart, liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle,
including changes in oxidative phosphorylation, protein and lipid
storage, and turnover (Speakman and Mitchell, 2011).
Although CR has been extensively studied regarding its effects
on many major organs, no study to date has focused on its
functional and metabolic effect on the skin. Studies of this are
important because the skin is the largest mammalian organ
and acts as a primary barrier against heat loss, dehydration, me-
chanical trauma, and microbial insults (Watt, 2014; Fuchs, 2015).
As a result, the skin and its appendages, such as hair follicles
(HFs), would be expected to be important in adaptations to stim-
uli such as dietary interventions with an effect on aging.
Interestingly, studies involving the effects and mechanisms of
CR using mice are conducted with animals housed under typical
laboratory conditions, including temperatures markedly below
thermoneutrality (Nedergaard and Cannon, 2013; Romanovsky,
2014). Under these conditions, metabolic rates increase greatly,
and animals depend more on their insulation capacity (Neder-
gaard and Cannon, 2013). Thus, CR studies showing that this
dietary intervention promotes life- and healthspan extension
were conducted in situations in which the structural and func-
tional characteristics of the skin and fur are particularly impor-
tant. This study was designed to uncover how CR affects the
skin and fur under typical laboratory animal conditions. Our find-
ings indicate not only that CR promotes extensive skin and fur
remodeling but show that this remodeling is critical for metabolic
fitness under conditions of limited energy intake.
RESULTS
CR Remodels the Fur Coat
We calorically restricted mice for 6 months, a time span sufficient
to observe many of the metabolic phenotypes associated with
this diet (McDonald and Ramsey, 2010). Consistent with prior
reports (Bruss et al., 2011), CR mice presented a 54% decrease
in body mass gain after this 6-month treatment and were consid-
erably smaller compared with ad libitum (AL)-fed counterparts
(Figure 1A; Figures S1A–S2C). CR animals also visibly displayed
more even, thick, and long back skin fur coats (Figure 1B). To
evaluate the composition of the fur coat, we quantified the four
types of hair follicles in the back skin; namely, awl, Auchenne,
zigzag, and guard. Awl hairs are straight and shorter than guard
hairs, contain three or four medulla cell rows, and form in the
second wave of hair morphogenesis at embryonic day 15
(E15)–E16.5 (M€
uller-Ro
¨ ver et al., 2001; Driskell et al., 2011). Their
numbers were unaltered in CR animals, but they presented less
dispersion between CR individuals (Figure 1C). Auchene hairs

 are similar to awl hairs, except they have one kink in the hair shaft
(M€
uller-Ro
¨ ver et al., 2001), and were present in equal quantities
in the AL and CR groups (Figure 1D). The same lack of change
was observed for zigzag hairs (Figure 1E), which present one
row of medulla cells and at least two bends in the hair shaft,
granting the characteristic ‘‘Z’’ shape. Guard hairs, the longest,
do not have kinks and develop during the first wave of hair follicle
morphogenesis at E13–E14.5 (Schlake, 2007). Despite their low
frequency, guard hairs presented highly increased density in CR
animals (Figure 1F; p % 0.001), doubling the quantities seen in AL
mice. This reflects a significant change in the percentage of
guard hairs, which was 2%–4% in AL animals and 6%–8% in
CR animals (Figure 1G; p % 0.001). Importantly, not only their
numbers but also their length was increased in CR animals
(Figure 1H; p % 0.05). These changes were specific to CR
animals and were not observed in AL animals matched for CR
animal size (Figure S2).
Overall, we characterized phenotypic alterations and a remod-
eled back skin fur coat coverage in CR. The growth of these hair
shafts is sustained by hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) (Hsu et al.,

 2014), so our next step was to investigate whether CR affected
epidermal stem cells.
CR Enlarges the Hair Follicle Stem Cell Pool and
Promotes Higher Hair Follicle Growth and Retention
Rates
Epidermal and hair follicle stem cells are responsible for the
maintenance of both the interfollicular epidermis as well as hair
follicles. To estimate the pool of CD29+ interfollicular and
CD34+/a6integrinHIGH hair follicle stem cells (Cotsarelis, 2006;
Arwert et al., 2012), we assessed their relative numbers using
flow cytometry. We found an overall increase in interfollicular
stem cells in CR animals (Figures 2A and 2B; p % 0.05) and
also an increase in the number of hair follicle stem cells associ-
ated with the bulge (Figures 2C and 2D; p % 0.05), which pro-
motes hair follicle maintenance and growth.
We asked next whether these expanded pools of stem cells
lead to stimulated hair growth rates. This was addressed by clip-
ping the fur off the back skin of AL and CR animals and evalu-
ating the regrowth rate (Figures 2E and 2F). Two weeks after
this procedure, the percentage of the original area covered
with new fur was much larger in CR mice (Figures 2E and 2F;
p % 0.001). This tendency was maintained until the last
measured time point (4 weeks), when CR animals displayed full
coverage of the initial area. A further indicator of the higher
growth rates displayed in CR animals is the area under the curve
shown in Figure 2F, almost double that for AL (Figure 2G; p %
0.001). We also evaluated whether hair shaft maintenance is
affected by CR. This was measured by dying the back skin
area and evaluating the color dilution because of the substitution
of lost follicles over 28 weeks (representative photos and an in-
depth color palette are shown in Figure 2H). Surprisingly, CR
animals presented much less hair shaft loss and lower substitu-
tion rates, a fact made evident by the maintenance of the area
that remained colored over time (Figures 2I and 2J; p % 0.001
and 0.05, respectively). This may be due to the fact that calorie
shortage imposed by CR can act as a mechanism to conserve
energy, delaying entry into catagen/telogen or the resting phase
when hair is released (M€
uller-Ro
¨ ver et al., 2001).
CR Thickens the Epidermis, Decreases Dermal White
Adipose Tissue, and Enlarges the Vascular Network
Next, we investigated whether CR induces morphologic or ultra-
structural alterations in the skin that accompany the changes
seen in the fur. Skin histology sections (Figure 3A) clearly demon-
strate that tissue ultrastructure is modified by prolonged CR.
Epidermal thickness was more than double in CR mice, reminis-
cent of young tissue (Figure 3B; p % 0.001). Conversely, AL
animals displayed thick dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT)
(Driskell et al., 2014; Alexander et al., 2015; Kasza et al., 2014),
contrasting with that observed in the CR group (Figure 3B, p %
0.001). This result is expected because this tissue is a fat depot
that stores excess energy.
CR has also been shown to improve angiogenesis and vessel
sprouting in a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-depen-
dent manner (Hoeben et al., 2004). To investigate whether this
was true for dermis-associated vasculature, we evaluated circu-
lating levels of murine VEGF (mVEGF) and found no significant
differences between AL and CR animals (Figure 3D). The same
lack of difference was observed in the epidermis (Figure 3E).
Nonetheless, the relative levels of mVEGF were almost three
times higher in the dermal compartment of CR animals (Fig-
ure 3F; p % 0.001). Because the main physiological function of
mVEGF is to induce capillary sprouts, dermis-associated vascu-
lature was evaluated by measuring CD31+ endothelial cells (Liu
and Shi, 2012). The relative numbers of CD31+ cells around the
bulge are indicative of vennule annules capillaries, responsible
for nutrient transport to the hair follicle stem cell niche. We found
that these cells were increased in CR animals (Figure 3G; p %
0.05). Accordingly, the relative area covered by CD31+ cells in
the dermis was also increased (Figure 3H; p % 0.001). More
importantly, after intravenous injection of a dye, the area covered
by the capillary net in the dermis was found to be increased
(Figure 3I; p % 0.05; digital mapping of the number of pixels
per circulatory branch area). These data collectively suggest
that the vasculature compartment is expanded in CR skin.
Because enlarged vasculature is associated with higher meta-
bolic substrate availability (Hoeben et al., 2004), we hypothe-
sized that CR could affect dermal and epidermal metabolism.
CR Leads to Metabolic Reprogramming in Both the
Epidermis and Dermis
How adult tissue stem cells metabolically respond to the nutri-
tional state of the whole organism is not well known (Mihaylova
et al., 2014). In differentiated cells, many studies demonstrate
that CR stimulates respiratory rates by increasing organelle
numbers or mass (mitochondrial biogenesis; Nisoli et al., 2004;
Guarente, 2008). To assess the effect of CR on skin metabolism,
we evaluated O2 consumption rates in intact primary cells
derived from both the epidermis and the dermis. To do this,
the epidermal sheet was separated from the dermis, and both
were enzymatically digested and mechanically dissociated into
single cells, generating primary cultures (Forni et al., 2016).
Real-time O2 consumption rates (OCRs) in CR epidermal pri-
mary cell cultures show that basal respiration (which represents
the sum of all physiological mitochondrial O2-consuming pro-
cesses) was decreased in the epidermal compartment, indi-
cating lower respiratory function compared with AL animals
(Figure 4A shows typical epidermis time scans quantified in sub-
sequent panels; Figure 4B; p % 0.001).
The injection of oligomycin (oligo), an ATP synthase inhibitor,
leads to a decrease in basal respiration that is reflective of O2
consumption used to generate ATP (Figure 4C). In addition to
low basal respiration, CR epidermal cells presented a very low
ATP-linked OCR (Figure 4C; p % 0.001), indicating a small contri-
bution of mitochondria toward ATP generation in these cells.
The addition of carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxy-phenyl-
hydrazone (CCCP) uncouples respiration from oxidative phos-
phorylation and allows for the measurement of maximal OCR
(Figure 4D), which was lower in CR epidermal cells (Figure 4D;
p % 0.001), indicating lower overall mitochondrial activity. The
spare respiratory capacity, calculated by subtracting CCCP-
stimulated from basal OCR, was not significantly different in AL
and CR epidermal cultures (Figure 4E). The proton leak, or
non-mitochondrial respiration subtracted from the post-oligo-
mycin injection OCR, is associated with the proton leak across

 the inner mitochondrial membrane independent of ATP synthase
activity. This rate was significantly increased in CR epidermal
cells (Figure 4F; p % 0.001), demonstrating that the lack of
ATP-linked respiration is not only due to the lower maximal res-
piratory capacity but also due to a decrease in coupling. Finally,
the extent of non-mitochondrial oxygen-consuming processes
was estimated by inhibiting the respiratory chain with antimycin
A and rotenone (Figure 4G). Non-mitochondrial respiration ac-
counted for a small fraction of cellular OCR but was significantly
lower in CR epidermis (Figure 4G; p % 0.001). The extracellular
acidification rate (ECAR), an indirect measurement of lactate
production and secretion, was also measured and found to be
unaltered (Figure 4H).
An entirely different metabolic response to CR was observed in
thedermis (Figure 4I).CR dermalcells displayednot onlysubstan-
tially enhanced basal OCRs (Figure 4J; p % 0.001) but also higher
ATP production-dependent respiration (Figure 4K; p % 0.05).

Thus,
the
CR
dermis
displays
an
enhanced respiratory phenotype, and
cells are highly dependent on mitochon-
dria for ATP generation. Moreover, both
maximal and spare respiratory capacities
were considerably increased (Figures 4L
and 4M; p % 0.001), indicating an expan-
sion of the mitochondrial network content
per cell. H+ leak-induced respiration was
decreased in CR dermal cells (Figure 4N;
p % 0.05), suggesting that a high percent-
age of the protons pumped toward elec-
tron transport chain complexes return to
the matrix through ATP synthase, maxi-
mizing ATP production. Finally, non-mito-
chondrial respiration (Figure 4O; p %
0.001) and ECAR (Figure 4P; p % 0.001)
were significantly increased in CR dermal
cells. Citrate synthase activity, which cor-
relates with mitochondrial mass, did not display significant differ-
ences between the two groups in theepidermis.A stark difference
was observed in the dermis, where the relative enzymatic activity
presented by CR animals was more than double that of the AL
group (Figures S3A and S3B). These observations support the
previous notion that mitochondrial function is enhanced by CR
mainly in the dermis.
Overall, the metabolic shift in the two most important skin
compartments,

the

and
changes in the fur, suggests that CR animals may present very
different thermoregulatory properties. To investigate this, we
analyzed heat loss in AL and CR mice.
Fur Coat Remodeling Improves Thermoregulatory
Properties in CR Animals
We hypothesized that changes in fur coats observed in CR ani-
mals could be related to thermoregulation and used an infrared

 thermal imaging system to capture the surface temperatures of
both AL and CR animals (Figure 5A). No significant differences
were observed between the AL and CR groups when the back
skin fur coat was present, indicating that CR animals maintain
a body surface temperature similar to AL animals. However,
when the same individuals were imaged after clipping the dorsal
body surface fur, CR animals presented significantly higher heat
loss (p % 0.001; quantifications are shown in Figure 5A, right).
This result indicates that the remodeled fur substantially contrib-
utes toward thermoregulation in CR animals.
Our infrared thermal imaging experiments lead us to hypothe-
size that CR animals display a coat with a higher insulating ca-
pacity. In mammals, a layer of air is trapped between the surface
of the skin and the outer surface of the hair coat, and the degree
of insulation can be altered by increasing or decreasing the thick-
ness of the air layer (Hart, 1956). To measure whether the CR-re-
modeled fur coat had better insulating properties, we developed
an Arduino-based system to simultaneously record the temper-
ature below (bottom) and above (top) the hair coat (Figure 5B).
Representative experimental traces are shown in Figure 5C for
both groups. The differences between body heat that reaches
the epidermis (bottom data) and the temperature at the hair sur-
face (top) are significantly larger in the CR group (blue lines), sug-
gesting that heat is more efficiently trapped by CR pelage. More-
over, a slight increase over time in the temperature of the fur coat
surface in the AL group (top, red line) indicates that this pelage is
more leaky than that of the CR group (Figure 5C). The average
difference in temperature between the body surface and hair
coat surface is shown in Figure 5D and, despite large individual
variability, showed a trend for CR fur to display a higher differ-
ence relative to the AL group (p = 0.057). These observations
again suggest that CR fur coats presents better insulating prop-
erties compared with the AL group.
The same system was coupled to a device measuring thermal
conductivity across a section of dissected back skin to measure
ex vivo differences in both intact skin plus fur and shaved skin
(Figure 5E), a setting that decreased variability between individ-
ual samples. We saw a significant decrease in shaved CR skin
temperature differences relative to shaved AL skin (p < 0.05),
indicating that changes in skin thickness and composition under
this dietary intervention make it less insulating. Notably, the dif-
ference in temperatures, comparing conditions with and without
fur, in CR samples was much larger than in AL samples, a result
in line with the increased thermal isolation of the CR fur coat seen
in in vivo experiments (Figure 5E; p % 0.001). These results
confirm that CR promotes an increase in fur coat insulation.
An additional factor in mammalian thermoregulation is dermal
blood flow, which is regulated to ensure that the difference in
temperature between the skin surface and the environment
remains constant, transporting heat from the body core to the
surface (Terrien et al., 2011). We assessed the vasculature in
the dermis in shaved CR and AL animals using a laser Doppler
apparatus before and after epinephrine stimulation. Basal blood
flow was increased in the CR group (Figure 5F; p % 0.05), indi-
cating that the dermal vasculature in this group presents a
decreased degree of vasoconstriction relative to that expected,
given that the absence of fur elicits a cold-induced response.
After an acute stimulus with epinephrine, blood flow increased
to equal levels in both groups. Recovery to basal levels was
observed in AL but not CR animals. Overall, vasoconstriction
appeared to be impaired in the CR group, as well as recovery
capacity (Figure 5G; p % 0.001). These alterations may further
contribute to the loss of heat observed in shaved CR animals
relative to AL animals.
Because typical laboratory animal housing conditions are
below thermoneutrality (Cannon and Nedergaard, 2011; Roma-
novsky, 2014), the energy spent on thermoregulation could be
a metabolic burden for CR mice, regulated by fur remodeling.
We thus asked what the effect of fur on global metabolic param-
eters is and how CR affects this.
Fur Removal Leads to Metabolic and Locomotion
Impairment in CR Animals
Whole-body energy metabolism can be evaluated in live mam-
mals by measuring metabolic processes that generate heat
through indirect calorimetry, following the amount of O2
consumed (Speakman, 2013). The data shown in Figures 6A
and 6B (black lines) show that CR mice present lower O2 con-
sumption (VO2) rates relative to AL animals, as expected
because of their smaller body size. Both AL and CR mice with
fur maintained constant VO2 rates over the 24-hr period. A higher
VO2 was observed in both groups after back skin hair clipping
(Figures 6A and 6B, blue lines) but with different patterns:
although the AL group presented constant levels of increased
VO2 throughout the light/dark cycle (Figure 6A, blue line), the
CR group displayed higher VO2 values during the first hours of
the dark cycle, which may indicate higher use of lipids as an en-
ergy source (lipids are more reduced). Interestingly, the levels of
both lactate and urea were increased in shaved CR animals 4 hr
after the beginning of the dark period (Figures S3C and S3D),
suggesting that protein degradation and lactate formation occur
in the CR group.
Heat released was relatively lower both in AL and CR animals
with fur (Figures 6C and 6D, black lines), and hair removal led to
increased energy expenditure in both groups (24% in the AL
group, 40% in the CR group; Figures 6C and 6D, blue lines).
Spontaneous physical activity (SPA) levels in AL animals were,
as expected (Oelkrug et al., 2015), higher during the dark period
and not changed by fur removal (Figure 6E). As described previ-
ously (Lusseau et al., 2015), CR animals with fur presented the
same ambulatory pattern whether in the dark or light (Figure 6F,
black line), with increased overall movement compared with AL
animals. When their fur coat was removed, the movement
pattern was disrupted, and CR animals spent substantial time
periods with very low spontaneous activity (yellow arrows, Fig-
ure 6F, blue line; the blue line in Figure 6G shows individual
shaved CR animal spontaneous movement traces for identifica-
tion of the low-movement periods). Indeed, these animals were
probably in a state of torpor because marked heat production
decreases were also observed during these periods (a heat
and SPA overlay for individual animals is shown in Figure 6G).
Whole-body metabolic assays in AL versus CR animals may,
however, present differing results because of the smaller body
size of CR animals. To explore this possibility, we used body
size/weight-matched younger AL animals (Figure S4). We failed

 to observe any similarities in VO2, heat, or SPA patterns between
body size-matched and CR animals (Table S1).
Overall, fur removal seems to promote substantial changes in
whole-body metabolic rates for AL and CR animals, with more
energy expenditure in CR animals. We thus decided to evaluate
the effect of prolonged fur absence.
Fur-Deprived CR Mice Lose Lean Mass, whereas Shaved
AL Animals Mobilize Fat
Because our results show that the lack of fur imposes different
thermoregulatory demands in AL and CR animals, we decided
to evaluate the role of prolonged fur absence (1 month) on
metabolic maintenance in animals. Our first observation was
that the absence of fur imposes a significant metabolic challenge
for both AL and CR mice. Weight loss occurred in shaved ani-
mals from both groups (Figure 7A; p % 0.001) despite an in-
crease in food consumption (Figure 7B; p < 0.05). Weights
were 53.43 ± 3.21 g at the beginning and 53.15 ± 3.10 g at the
end of the experiments for AL animals and 35.98 ± 0.95 g at
the beginning and 32.13 ± 1.02 g at the end of the 1-month
period for CR animals.
Next, dual X-ray absorptiometry scan measurements were
used to measure body composition and indicated that, after
1 month without fur, changes occurred in both the AL and CR
groups, but through distinct mechanisms (Figure 7C). Fat area
measurements show that this depot is used by AL animals to
overcome the increasing thermoregulatory energetic demand
imposed by fur coat removal because there is a significant
decrease in the relative area occupied by adipose tissue in this
group (Figure 7D; p % 0.05). CR animals already displayed
very modest fat depots before shaving and did not lose a signif-
icant amount of this depot (Figure 7D). Instead, CR animals
mobilized lean muscle (Figure 7E; p % 0.001).
To determine whether other organs were subject to energetic
recruitment, we weighed them post mortem (Figures 7F–7M).
Validating our in vivo measurements, the visceral fat mass was
greatly decreased in shaved AL animals and slightly diminished
in their CR counterparts (Figure 7F; p % 0.001 and p % 0.05,
respectively). The soleus muscle mass was decreased only in
CR animals after fur coat removal, suggesting muscle utilization
in this group (Figure 7G; p % 0.001). Heart weights increased in
both groups after shaving (Figure 7H; p % 0.001 and p % 0.05
for AL and CR, respectively), possibly because of changes in
vasculature and circulation. The spleen and brown adipose tissue
(BAT) displayed a curious pattern of decreased mass in AL
shaved animals and increased mass in shaved CR mice (Figures
7I and 7J; p % 0.05). The spleen effect may be related to immune
system impairment. Brown fat depots (Figure 7J) may be
extended in CR animals to counteract heat loss (Oelkrug et al.,
2015). Other organs, such as the liver and kidney (Figure 7K
and 7L), as well as the femur (Figure 7M) did not present changes.
Overall, our data suggest that, when the fur coat is removed,
CR animals display defective thermoregulation associated with
a rupture in locomotion patterns and lean weight loss. These
findings are especially significant because they unveil not only
a striking effect of CR on the skin but also an adaptive mecha-
nism to cope with reduced insulation derived from skin changes
under conditions of reduced caloric intake.

 DISCUSSION
CR is the most studied non-genetic intervention capable of
increasing lifespan and healthspan in a plethora of model organ-
isms (McDonald and Ramsey, 2010). In mammals, the shortage
in calories elicits compensatory responses (Efeyan et al., 2015)
that were thought, until recently, to preserve noble organs (Lus-
seau et al., 2015). Perhaps because of this assumption, the skin,
an organ often thought of as secondary in metabolic regulation,
remained unstudied in terms of energy metabolism in response
to CR to date.
We focused here on modifications promoted by CR to the skin
and found that significant structural and functional changes
occur. Some studies demonstrate that CR stimulates respiratory
rates in specific tissues by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis
(Tattersall and Milsom, 2003) as well as stimulating uncoupling
between O2 consumption and oxidative phosphorylation (Tatter-
sall et al., 2006; Zhao and Cao, 2009). In the skin, this metabolic
shift occurs in the dermal compartment, where we found that CR
induces a more oxidative phenotype (Figure 4). However, the
epidermal compartment presents a less prominent oxidative
metabolism in CR in a manner not compensated by glycolytic
upregulation (Figure 4). This metabolic phenotype has frequently
been associated with quiescent stem cells (Ito and Suda 2014)
and could be due to the significant expansions in stem cell pools
induced by CR in the epidermis (Figure 2). Indeed, the numbers
of interfollicular epidermal stem cells were enhanced in CR,
which probably accounts for the thicker epidermal layer. The
thickening of the epidermis observed in CR (Figure 3) may be
functionally significant because epidermis thinning is associated
with increased frailty and injury susceptibility in aging (Lo
´ pez-
Otı
´n et al., 2013). An increase in the hair follicle stem cell pool,

 a population of cells involved in fur maintenance, was also
observed in CR. Indeed, fur coats were remodeled by CR and
presented increased hair growth rates and better hair retention
(Figure 3).
Our findings indicating that CR expands stem cell populations
in the skin are in line with previous data on other stem cell pop-
ulations, including intestinal stem cells in mice (Yilmaz et al.,
2012) and invertebrates such as Drosophila (Rogers and Rogina,
2014). Stem cell pool expansion also occurs in the skeletal mus-
cle of animals exposed to other forms of dietary restriction (Hep-
ple et al., 2006). Interestingly, the stem cell activation status may
be more quiescent in CR, a finding in line with the active repres-
sion in epithelial cancer incidence observed with this diet (Stein-
bach et al., 1993; Hursting et al., 2013).
In addition to being controlled by stem cell populations, fur
growth also depends on the vasculature. Indeed, vessel sprout-
ing is important to foster nutrient and oxygen supplies in most
tissues (Hoeben et al., 2004). In CR animals, hair shaft growth
is accompanied by VEGF-related vasculature expansion in the
dermal and vennule annulus compartments (Figure 3). These
changes certainly help provide necessary nutrients for skin re-
modeling but may represent a burden to CR mice devoid of fur
because vasoconstriction and recovery capacities are impaired
with this diet (Figure 5), leading to an increase in heat loss and
overall energy expenditure.
Globally, we find that CR animals display an array of structural
and metabolic alterations that promote changes in heat genera-
tion and maintenance. In this regard, it is important to remember
that animal housing facilities are generally maintained at temper-
atures around 22�C, below the thermoneutral range (28�C–31�C)
for most murine strains (Ravussin et al., 2012). As a result, mice
housed and/or tested in typical laboratory environments,
including those in which CR is found to be beneficial, are sub-
jected to cold stress (Ravussin et al., 2012). Interestingly, sweat-
ing and panting are not important thermoregulatory mechanisms
for rodents, so these animals may rely heavily on their skin and
fur for proper thermoregulation (Hart, 1956; Romanovsky,
2014). In the skin, we found that CR predictably decreases
dWAT but also leads to epidermal thickening. Although some
studies question the importance of dWAT thickness for insula-
tion (Fischer et al., 2016; Abreu-Vieira et al., 2015), the thinner
dWAT in the CR animals could have an effect on thermoregula-
tion (Norgan, 1997) because AL skin in the absence of fur was
found to be significantly less insulating than CR skin devoid of
fur (Figure 5E).
Additionally, the fur in AL and CR animals is markedly different
(Figure 1). To verify whether CR-remodeled fur improved thermal
insulation, we performed thermographic measurements of sur-
face temperatures in the AL and CR groups in the presence
and absence of pelage (Blumberg et al., 2002; Scott et al.,
2008; Tattersall et al., 2006, 2009). Our results (Figure 5A)
show that heat loss is equal in AL and CR animals in the presence
of fur but that CR animals loose considerably higher amounts of
heat when devoid of fur. This result suggests that fur remodeling
in CR is involved in insulation, although associated changes in
blood flow and vasoconstriction are also present and signifi-
cantly modified by the diet (Figures 5F and 5G). When we evalu-
ated the insulating physical properties of the fur coat in CR
animals, we found that it presents low thermal conductivity, con-
firming its enhanced insulation properties (Figures 5C–5E). Over-
all, our data show that compensatory changes in vasculature,
skin, and fur thermal isolation occur with CR, resulting in animals
that present equal heat loss in the presence of fur but higher heat
loss when shaved.
The removal of this remodeled fur coat thus presents a specific
challenge for CR animals. Notably, some authors have shown
that, under temperature stresses, most insulation occurs via
physiological mechanisms, with little contribution from fur or
fat (Abreu-Vieira et al., 2015). However, there is also evidence
that the fur may be important in rodents: shaved Swiss mice at
peak lactation spend more time feeding and increase food intake
(Zhao and Cao, 2009), and shaving increases energy expendi-
ture in voles (Kenagy and Pearson, 2000; Szafra�
nska et al.,
2014) and squirrels (Kauffman et al., 2004). Indeed, we found
that CR animals present very significant weight loss, mostly
because of muscle loss, when shaved (Figure 7). The preferential
channeling of excess energy to fat depots instead of muscle in
mammals has been extensively documented (Goodman et al.,
1980), and the importance of fat depots for individual fitness is
also well established (Norgan, 1997). Under increased thermo-
regulatory demand, these energy depots can be mobilized to
generate heat (Dodson et al., 2010; D’Andrea, 2016). In fact,
AL animals devoid of fur used fat depots (Figure 7). Nonetheless,
the amount of stored fat in CR animals seems to be insufficient to
cope with this increased energetic demand, and lean mass con-
sumption (muscle) also takes place (Cahill, 2006). This energy
crisis in shaved CR animals is accompanied by a disruption in
locomotion pattern (Figure 6) that, in wildlife, would probably
affect fitness and survival.
In summary, our results show that CR induces significant
vasculature, skin, and fur remodeling in mice, generating a
coat with better thermoregulatory properties that compen-
sates for enhanced heat loss without it. An increased pool of
hair follicle stem cells accompanies these phenotypic alter-
ations, and probably sustains them, along with an increase
in VEGF-mediated dermis-associated vasculature and a bio-
energetic shift in both the epidermis and dermis. This could
be an evolutionarily selected mechanism that couples skin
stem cell plasticity to a thermoregulatory adaptation that al-
lows mammals to increase their fitness and thrive under con-
ditions of caloric limitation.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals and Dietary Interventions
The experiments were conducted in agreement with the NIH guidelines for hu-
mane treatment of animals and were reviewed and approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee (permit number 2013/17). For long-term studies,
female 8-week-old Swiss mice were separated into two groups: AL, fed AL
with an AIN-93-M diet, and CR, fed daily with 60% of a diet supplemented
with micronutrients to reach the vitamin and mineral levels consumed by AL
animals (Table S2; Rhoster Lab, Campinas, Brazil). Body mass and food con-
sumption were recorded weekly (Figure S1). Food was offered to CR groups at
the same time daily (9:00/11:00 a.m.), and the CR feeding amount was weight-
adjusted weekly based on AL food consumption measured 1 week prior. The
animals were lodged at 22�C, five individuals per cage, in 12-hr light/dark
cycles, and given water AL. After 6 months, mice were euthanized after
12 hr of overnight fasting, and tissues were dissected and weighed.

 Back Skin Hair Follicle Evaluation
A 0.5-cm2 area was shaved, and the follicles were manually sorted and iden-
tified using a magnifying glass. The back skin hair follicle types (guard, awl, au-
chene, and zigzag) were differentiated by length of the hair shaft, number of
medulla cells, and presence of kinks (bends; M€
uller-Ro
¨ ver et al., 2001). The
procedure was conducted in a double-blind manner by two independent
counters. Guard hair follicle length was also measured.
Flow Cytometry
Back skins for hair follicle stem cell isolation and staining protocols were pre-
pared as described previously (Forni et al., 2015). Subcutaneous fat was
removed with a scalpel, and the whole skin was placed dermis-down on
trypsin (Gibco) at 37�C for 30 min. Single-cell suspensions were obtained by
scraping the skin gently to remove the epidermis. The cells were then filtered
with strainers (70 mm followed by 40 mm). After blocking with 2% BSA in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBSA), cell suspensions were incubated with anti-
bodies for 30 min on ice: a6 integrin (eBioscience, phycoerythrin [PE]-conju-
gated), CD34 (eBioscience, Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated), CD29 (eBioscience,
PE-conjugated) (Table S3). Negative controls comprised of the same class of
immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotype controls. Unbound antibodies were washed
out through two cycles of PBSA washes, and cells were analyzed using a
BD FACSAria II flow cytometer. Data were analyzed and compensated using
FlowJo TriStar V10, and at least 50,000 events per sample were collected.
Hair Growth and Permanence
AL and CR (6-month treatment) back skin hair was trimmed with electric
clippers, and active follicle growth (anagen) was observed by hair regrowth
measurements. Animals were checked weekly, and areas that entered
anagen were quantified in comparison with the original shaved area. Skin
regions that had entered anagen (based on regrowth) were photographed,
digitalized, and analyzed using ImageJ. Images of each time point were
segmented, and the area and number of anagen regions were calculated
and corrected for the 2D area of back skin at the original data point. To
assess hair follicle tissue permanence, animals had the back skin area colored
with a permanent hair dye. The analysis performed was similar to that cited
above, following the fading of the dye color through pixel color intensity using
ImageJ.
Histology and Immunofluorescence
Back skin tissues were trimmed and fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. They
were then embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound and frozen.
After cryosectioning (10–12 mm), they were subjected to immunofluorescence
microscopy or H&E staining (Schepeler et al., 2014). The antibodies and their
dilutions are shown in Table S3. Secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa
488 and Alexa 647 (Molecular Probes) were used for imaging. Nuclei were
stained using DAPI. Imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510-Meta
laser-scanning confocal microscope. Figures were prepared using ImageJ.
Western Blots
Total proteins from cell lysates were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer (100 mM
Tris-HCl, 2% w/v SDS, 10% v/v glycerol, and 0.1% bromophenol blue) con-
taining 100 mM DTT. After heating at 90�C for 5 min, equal amounts of protein,
determined through Bradford quantification, were separated by SDS-PAGE
and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After membranes were
blocked with 5% BSA, detection of individual proteins was carried out by blot-
ting with specific primary antibodies (Table S3). Near-infrared detection using
a secondary antibody linked to an infrared dye (LI-COR Biosciences) was used
and quantitated with LI-COR Odyssey software. Signals were analyzed by
densitometry using ImageJ, and the proteins were normalized either to actin
or the stated reference.
OCRs and ECARs
OCRs were measured in primary cultures using an XF24 Bioanalyzer (Sea-
horse Bioscience) as described previously (Forni et al., 2016). An assay me-
dium composed of 114 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.16 mM
MgSO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2 (pH 7.2), and 10 mM glucose was used. Cells were
seeded in an XF24 24-well microplate at 60,000 cells/well (0.32-cm2 growth
area) in 500 mL of growth medium and incubated overnight at 37�C in a humid-
ified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Before the assay, the medium was
replaced with 500 mL assay medium. Cells were preincubated for 1 hr at 37�C
in air. ATP production-linked O2 consumption was determined by addition of
oligomycin (0.5 mg/mL). After 3 measurement cycles, 5 mM of the uncoupler
CCCP was added to determine the maximal respiratory capacity. After a
further 3 cycles of measurement, 1 mM rotenone and 1 mM antimycin A were
added, ablating mitochondrial O2 consumption. All respiratory modulators
were used at concentrations determined through preliminary titration experi-
ments to determine the ideal quantities for the cell types used.
Infrared Thermal Imaging
Mice were anesthetized (mask inhalation of isoflurane vaporized in a N2/O2
mixture at concentrations of up to 4% in the induction phase and at 0.8%–
1.3% during prolonged experiments) and placed on a tray covered with black
thermoneutral paper. The first thermographic score was initiated 10 minutes
later to discard any human temperature interference during the thermal imag-
ing acquisition protocol. The dorsal temperature was measured by infrared (IR)
thermal images (thermograms) obtained using an IR-sensitive camera (FLIR
SC 660). This device produces a 12-bit image (640 3 480 pixels) and stores
the temperature information for each pixel with 0.1�C resolution. The tech-
nique detects IR wavelength electromagnetic radiation (8–12 mm). We
assumed an emissivity of 0.95, as estimated for biological tissues (Scott
et al., 2008; Tattersall et al., 2009). All readings were automatically corrected
for a non-black body. IR thermal images were analyzed with FLIR Research
IR professional analyzing software.
Thermal Conductivity and Insulating Properties of the Hair Coat and
Whole Skin
A temperature recording system was created using a customizable Arduino
platform. A negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor with a 3950K
beta factor and a nominal resistance of 10 kilo-ohms (kU) was used for fur con-
ductivity quantifications. Temperatures were recorded in isoflurane-anesthe-
tized live animals at 15-ms intervals. Five measurements were averaged for
a total time of 5 min for each sensor position, either below or above the fur
coat. Temperatures were corrected using the Steinhart-Hart equation. Tem-
peratures in the ‘‘above’’ sensor were subtracted from temperatures of the
‘‘below’’ sensor to account for temperature differences promoted by the air
layer trapped in the pelage. Measurements were also conducted ex vivo, for
whole skin conductivity quantification, with and without fur. Animals were
euthanized, and the back skin was immediately dissected and placed on a
conical device on top of a Benchmark digital hotplate stirrer used as a stable
heat source. The first measurements were made with fur; after hair clipping,
measurements were made again without fur. Two LM35 sensors were used
to record temperatures every 20 ms; eight measurements were used to calcu-
late mean values. Mean values for the sensor above the skin were subtracted
from the ones near the heat source and presented as changes in temperature.
Electronic components were measured, and temperatures were calibrated us-
ing a Minipa ET-1110DMM digital multimeter with a Type K thermocouple.
Laser Doppler Measurements of Peripheral Skin Blood Flow
A laser Doppler perfusion monitor (Moor Instruments, Axminster, UK) with a
satellite unit detecting flux using a laser probe was adapted from Seabra
et al. (2004) and Vercelino et al. (2013). Animals were anesthetized using
isoflurane. After shaving the back skin area, laser Doppler probes were
secured to the overlying skin. Cutaneous blood flow, measured as red
blood cell flux, was used as an index of peripheral circulation. Recordings
were displayed continuously by moorLAB v1.31 for Windows. At 1-s intervals,
real-time mean blood flow was recorded. After monitoring for 300 s, a single
dose of epinephrine (0.2 mg in 20 mL) was applied subcutaneously approxi-
mately 3 cm from the probe site (Holloway, 1980), and 100 s were recorded
as the stimulated period. The remaining 200 s were recorded as the recovery
period.
Indirect Calorimetry
O2 consumption (VO2) and CO2 production were measured using a custom-
ized,
high-precision,
single-chamber
indirect
calorimeter
(Columbus

 Instruments; Even et al., 1994; Meyer et al., 2015). Each mouse was acclima-
tized to an individual metabolic chamber 1 day before the measurements.
Chambers were kept at 22�C with 12-hr light/dark cycles. CR mice were fed
1 hr after the beginning of the light cycle. Thermogenesis was calculated
from O2 consumption and CO2 production. Calibration was performed before
each measurement using primary standard gases. The chamber lid was
sealed, and room air was pumped through the chamber at atmospheric pres-
sure at 0.8 L/min. Data were collected every 20 min for 24 hr, with each data
point identified by a time stamp. After 24 hr, hair trimming experiments were
conducted. Another 24 hr were recorded without the fur coat.
SPA Measurements
SPA was measured simultaneously with calorimetry. The metabolic chamber
was equipped with IR photocell sensors (OptoVarimex, Columbus Instru-
ments). Measurements were performed using customized, high-precision
racks of collimated IR activity sensors placed around the acrylic chamber.
There were 45 collimated beams crossing the 30-cm-diameter cage, allowing
detection of 1-cm movement in three orthogonal axes. Photosensors regis-
tered an activity unit each time a beam was interrupted. Physical activity
was detected simultaneously on all three axes: forward and backward (x),
side to side (y), and up and down (z). SPA was added for every minute.
Dual X-Ray Absorptiometry Measurements
Mice were scanned 1 month after hair trimming using the FX Pro in vivo imag-
ing system (Akron, Ohio, USA). A combination of xylazine (10 mg/kg) and ke-
tamine (90 mg/kg) was used for sedation. The animals were scanned in a prone
position with extended extremities. Fat mass and lean body mass (muscle)
were measured in the abdomen (top of the pelvis to the lowermost rib) and
whole body (excluding the head). The percentage of abdominal fat was calcu-
lated as abdominal fat content divided by total abdomen tissue content. The
percentage of total body fat was calculated as total body fat content divided
by total body tissue content. The muscle section was evaluated in the lower
paws.
Animal and Organ Weights
We observed recommendations from the Society of Toxicologic Pathology.
The animal necropsy order was randomized to prevent bias, and the necropsy
order was maintained to obtain meaningful organ weight data. Organs were
isolated, and all extraneous tissues (e.g., fat) were removed. Fresh organ
weight was determined immediately. Paired organs were weighed together.
Terminal body weight was collected at necropsy to control for potential varia-
tions induced by novel and stressful handling and diurnal fluctuations (Sellers
et al., 2007; Mann et al., 2014).
Statistical Analysis and Art
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism and Origin softwares. Figures
represent averages ± SEM of 3–12 measurements and were compared using
ANOVA. Two-tailed p values under 0.05 were considered significant. Servier
Medical Art and Mind the Graph templates were used.
