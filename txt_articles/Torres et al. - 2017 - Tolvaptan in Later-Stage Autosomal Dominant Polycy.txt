BACKGROUND
In a previous trial involving patients with early autosomal dominant polycystic 
kidney disease (ADPKD; estimated creatinine clearance, ≥60 ml per minute), the 
vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist tolvaptan slowed the growth in total kidney 
volume and the decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) but also 
caused more elevations in aminotransferase and bilirubin levels. The efficacy and 
safety of tolvaptan in patients with later-stage ADPKD are unknown.
METHODS
We conducted a phase 3, randomized withdrawal, multicenter, placebo-controlled, 
double-blind trial. After an 8-week prerandomization period that included sequen-
tial placebo and tolvaptan run-in phases, during which each patient’s ability to 
take tolvaptan without dose-limiting side effects was assessed, 1370 patients with 
ADPKD who were either 18 to 55 years of age with an estimated GFR of 25 to 65 ml 
per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area or 56 to 65 years of age with an esti-
mated GFR of 25 to 44 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 were randomly assigned in a 
1:1 ratio to receive tolvaptan or placebo for 12 months. The primary end point was 
the change in the estimated GFR from baseline to follow-up, with adjustment for 
the exact duration that each patient participated (interpolated to 1 year). Safety 
assessments were conducted monthly.
RESULTS
The change from baseline in the estimated GFR was −2.34 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 
(95% confidence interval [CI], −2.81 to −1.87) in the tolvaptan group, as compared 
with −3.61 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 (95% CI, −4.08 to −3.14) in the placebo 
group (difference, 1.27 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.68; P<0.001). 
Elevations in the alanine aminotransferase level (to >3 times the upper limit of the 
normal range) occurred in 38 of 681 patients (5.6%) in the tolvaptan group and in 
8 of 685 (1.2%) in the placebo group. Elevations in the aminotransferase level were 
reversible after stopping tolvaptan. No elevations in the bilirubin level of more 
than twice the upper limit of the normal range were detected.
CONCLUSIONS
Tolvaptan resulted in a slower decline than placebo in the estimated GFR over a 
1-year period in patients with later-stage ADPKD. (Funded by Otsuka Pharmaceu-
ticals and Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development and Commercialization; REPRISE

Tolvaptan in Later-Stage ADPKD
A
utosomal dominant polycystic kid-
ney disease (ADPKD) is the fourth lead-
ing cause of end-stage kidney disease in 
adults.1-3 When the genes encoding polycystin 1 
(PKD1) and polycystin 2 (PKD2) are disrupted, 
tubular epithelial cells in vasopressin-sensitive 
distal nephrons and collecting ducts show en-
hanced proliferation, chloride-driven fluid secre-
tion, and expression of proinflammatory cyto-
kines, resulting in cyst development and the 
destruction of renal parenchyma.4
Vasopressin promotes kidney-cyst cell prolifera-
tion and fluid secretion by means of up-regulation 
of adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP).5,6 
The suppression of vasopressin production, release, 
or action by means of hydration,7,8 V2-receptor 
blockade,9-14 or genetic mutation15 has been shown 
to reduce cyst burden, protect kidney function, 
and prolong survival in rodent models.
In the Tolvaptan Efficacy and Safety in Manage-
ment of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney 
Disease and Its Outcomes (TEMPO) 3:4 trial, 
which involved patients with early ADPKD (esti-
mated creatinine clearance, ≥60 ml per minute), 
tolvaptan reduced kidney growth and the decline 
in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR).16 
The benefit with regard to the estimated GFR 
was maintained after 2 additional years of open-
label treatment (TEMPO 4:4 study).17 Idiosyncratic 
hepatocellular toxic effects were unanticipated.18 
With monitoring occurring once every 4 months, 
two patients in the TEMPO 3:4 trial and one in 
the TEMPO 4:4 study had evidence of potentially 
serious drug-induced liver injury. We conducted 
the Replicating Evidence of Preserved Renal Func-
tion: an Investigation of Tolvaptan Safety and 
Efficacy in ADPKD (REPRISE) trial, a phase 3, 
randomized withdrawal, multicenter, placebo-
controlled, double-blind trial involving patients 
with ADPKD who had late chronic kidney disease 
of stage 2 to early stage 4, in order to ascertain 
the efficacy and safety of tolvaptan in patients 
with more advanced ADPKD with the use of more 
frequent monitoring for toxic effects in the liver.19
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
The institutional review board at each site ap-
proved the protocol and the informed-consent 
form. A steering committee that comprised in-
vestigators and representatives of the sponsor 
(Otsuka Pharmaceuticals and Otsuka Pharma-
ceutical Development and Commercialization) 
oversaw the trial design and conduct with the 
assistance of an independent data and safety 
monitoring committee and a hepatic adjudica-
tion committee. The sponsor collected and ana-
lyzed the data. The first author wrote the manu-
script with substantial contributions from the 
coauthors (including authors who are employees 
of the sponsor) and assumes responsibility for 
its content and integrity. The sponsor had no 
other role in writing or reviewing the manuscript. 
All the authors had access to the analyzed data, 
jointly decided to submit the manuscript for pub-
lication, and vouch for the accuracy and com-
pleteness of the reported data and for fidelity of 
the trial to the protocol. The trial protocol, 
which is available with the full text of this article 
at NEJM.org, has been published previously.19
From May 2014 through March 2016, patients 
were enrolled at 213 sites globally. Eligible per-
sons were either 18 to 55 years of age with an 
estimated GFR of 25 to 65 ml per minute per 
1.73 m2 of body-surface area or 56 to 65 years of 
age with an estimated GFR of 25 to 44 ml per 
minute per 1.73 m2. Patients in the older age 
group also had to have historical evidence of a 
decline in the estimated GFR of more than 2.0 ml 
per minute per 1.73 m2 per year.20
The trial consisted of an 8-week prerandom-
ization period that was divided into a screening 
phase, a single-blind placebo run-in phase, and 
a single-blind tolvaptan period that comprised a 
dose-adjustment phase and a run-in phase (Fig. 
S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org). Patients who could take tolvaptan at 
daily morning and afternoon doses of 60 mg and 
30 mg, respectively, or 90 mg and 30 mg, respec-
tively, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, in a 
double-blind fashion, to receive tolvaptan or match-
ing placebo for 12 months. Randomization was 
stratified according to the baseline estimated GFR 
(≤45 or >45 ml per minute per 1.73 m2), age of 
the patient (≤55 or >55 years), and total kidney 
volume (≤2000 ml, >2000 ml, or unknown).21 The 
maximal dose of tolvaptan that could be taken 
without an unacceptable level of side effects dur-
ing the run-in period, or the equivalent as match-
ing placebo, was dispensed according to the ran-
domization assignment. Adjustment of the dose 
down to morning and afternoon doses of 45 mg 
and 15 mg, respectively, or of 30 mg and 15 mg, 
respectively, was permitted during the trial period.
Serum creatinine levels were measured cen-

trally with the use of the isotope dilution mass 
spectrometry–traceable enzymatic method and 
were reported to two decimal points.19,22 Deter-
minations of the estimated GFR were made with 
the use of the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemi-
ology Collaboration equation.23
Trial Assessments
Evaluations were performed at baseline (during the 
screening and placebo run-in phases) and dur-
ing the single-blind tolvaptan period (Fig. S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Patients underwent 
monthly laboratory testing and reported to the 
trial sites every 3 months. Three follow-up labo-
ratory visits occurred between days 7 and 40 after 
the receipt of the last dose of the assigned trial 
regimen. For patients who did not complete the 
trial, the follow-up period started after the discon-
tinuation of the trial regimen and included a final 
follow-up at the originally scheduled 12-month visit.
Outcome Measures
Primary End Point
The primary end point was the change in the 
estimated GFR from baseline (before the receipt 
of any placebo or tolvaptan) to follow-up (after 
the 1-year trial period had been completed), with 
adjustment for the time each patient was in the 
trial and with interpolation to 1 year. Without 
this adjustment, the trial group that had more 
withdrawals or earlier withdrawals would have 
had an advantage because patients who with-
drew early would have had less time for renal-
function deterioration. The GFR values that were 
obtained before and after the receipt of any 
placebo or tolvaptan were estimated from the 
mean of three baseline serum creatinine values 
(two obtained during screening and one during 
the placebo run-in phase) and from the mean of 
three follow-up values that were obtained after 
the 1-year trial period was completed. The trial 
duration for each patient was defined as the in-
terval between the median timings of the base-
line observations and the follow-up observations. 
These estimated GFR measurements were not 
affected by the acute hemodynamic effect of 
tolvaptan, which is rapidly reversible when the 
drug is not being taken.24-26 Vasopressin acting 
on V2-receptors increases the glomerular filtra-
tion rate by means of the activation of tubuloglo-
merular feedback and afferent vasodilation and 
by means of renin release and efferent vasocon-
striction27,28; tolvaptan counteracts these effects.
Key Secondary End Point
The key secondary end point was the slope of 
the change in the estimated GFR that was de-
rived from the individual slopes for each patient, 
with adjustment for the duration of the obser-
vations and with interpolation to 1 year. This 
analysis included data for each participant in 
each group and used all the serum creatinine 
values that were obtained during the placebo 
run-in phase, the tolvaptan run-in period (not 
including the tolvaptan dose-adjustment phase), 
the 12-month double-blind period, and the follow-
up phase in a linear model that included a factor 
to account for the hemodynamic effect on the es-
timated GFR during the tolvaptan run-in period 
and the 1-year trial period.
Hepatic Safety Monitoring
All the cases of elevations in the hepatic amino-
transferase level to more than three times the 
upper limit of the normal range, elevations in 
the total bilirubin level to more than two times 
the upper limit of the normal range, and hepatic-
related adverse events (that were serious or that 
led to the discontinuation of the trial regimen) 
were adjudicated by the hepatic adjudication com-
mittee. The members of this committee, who 
were unaware of the trial-group assignments, 
rated the likelihood that the trial regimen 
caused the event on a scale from “unlikely” to 
“definite.”18
Statistical Analysis
On the basis of a mixed-model, repeated-measure-
ment analysis involving the non-Japanese patients 
with chronic kidney disease of stage 3 who were 
included in the TEMPO 3:4 trial, we calculated 
that it would be necessary for the present trial to 
include 1300 patients in order to test the pri-
mary hypothesis, assuming a between-group 
difference at 1 year in the decline in the esti-
mated GFR of 1.07 ml per minute per 1.73 m2, 
with a standard deviation of 5.73, 90% power, a 
two-sided alpha level of 0.05, and a 10% rate of 
withdrawal.19,26 (Data from the Japanese patients 
in the TEMPO 3:4 trial were not included in the 
power calculations because the present trial 
[REPRISE] was not planned to include Japanese

patients.) The analyses of all the efficacy end 
points were performed according to the inten-
tion-to-treat principle. Details of the prespecified 
sensitivity and subgroup analyses are provided 
in the protocol.19 The end points of the trial were 
ordered hierarchically and tested sequentially 
with gatekeeping procedures; if the primary end 
point was found to be significant, analysis of the 
secondary end point would be justified.
A modified intention-to-treat population or full 
analysis set, in accordance with the intention-to-
treat principle and the E9 regulation (regarding 
statistical principles for clinical trials) of the 
International Conference on Harmonisation, was 
used for the analysis of the primary end point. 
All patients with any data to inform the primary 
or secondary end points or safety were included 
in the modified intention-to-treat and safety 
populations. The primary end point was analyzed 
by means of a weighted analysis of covariance 
with trial group and randomization stratifica-
tion factors as factor and baseline covariates, as 
described in the Supplementary Appendix and 
the statistical analysis plan (see the protocol). 
The key secondary end point was also assessed 
in the modified intention-to-treat population 
and was analyzed with the use of a linear mixed-
effect model with effects of time (as a continu-
ous variable), trial group, interaction of time and 
trial group, acute hemodynamic effect, stratifica-
tion factors at randomization, and baseline co-
variate (of the primary end point) to fit the esti-
mated GFR data (see the statistical analysis plan).
Results
Patients
A total of 2292 patients underwent screening 
and provided informed consent; 1496 patients 
entered the single-blind tolvaptan period, of whom 
126 withdrew before randomization (owing to 
aquaretic events [polyuria, nocturia, thirst, dry 
mouth, and polydipsia] in 68 patients). The re-
maining 1370 patients (91.6%) who entered the 
single-blind tolvaptan period and did not have 
adverse effects that prevented their continuation 
in the trial were randomly assigned to receive 
tolvaptan (683 patients) or placebo (687 patients). 
A total of 95.8% of the patients in the tolvaptan 
group and 95.9% of those in the placebo group 
completed the month 12 visit. Details are pro-
vided in Figure 1, and in Tables S1 and S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
Of the 1370 patients who underwent random-
ization, 1331 (97.2%) were included in the pri-
mary efficacy analysis, 1362 (99.4%) in the key 
secondary efficacy analysis, and 1366 (99.7%) in 
the safety analysis. The demographic and clini-
cal characteristics of the patients at baseline were 
balanced between the two groups. Most patients 
had chronic kidney disease of stage 3a (30.1%), 
stage 3b (45.2%), or stage 4 (19.5%) (Table 1).
Tolvaptan Dose
At the end of the single-blind tolvaptan period, 
1128 of 1370 patients (82.3%) were receiving 
daily morning and afternoon doses of 90 mg 
and 30 mg, respectively, and 242 (17.7%) were re-
ceiving 60 mg and 30 mg, respectively (Table 1). 
Patients who were randomly assigned to the 
tolvaptan group and who completed the trial 
(578 patients) were taking daily morning and 
afternoon doses of 90 mg and 30 mg, respectively 
(350 patients [60.6%]); 60 mg and 30 mg, respec-
tively (173 [29.9%]); or 45 mg and 15 mg, respec-
tively, or less (55 [9.5%]). Patients who were 
randomly assigned to the placebo group and who 
completed the trial (637 patients) were taking 
mock morning and afternoon doses of 90 mg 
and 30 mg, respectively (447 patients [70.2%]); 
60 mg and 30 mg, respectively (171 [26.8%]); or 
45 mg and 15 mg, respectively, or less (19 [3.0%]).
Primary End Point
The mean (±SE) change in the estimated GFR at 
1 year, with adjustment for the duration of the 
trial for each patient, was −2.34±0.24 ml per 
minute per 1.73 m2 (95% confidence interval 
[CI], −2.81 to −1.87) in the tolvaptan group, as 
compared with −3.61±0.24 ml per minute per 
1.73 m2 (95% CI, −4.08 to −3.14) in the placebo 
group. Tolvaptan resulted in a slower decline 
than placebo in the estimated GFR at 1 year (dif-
ference, 1.27 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95% CI, 
0.86 to 1.68; P<0.001) (Fig. 2A).
Prespecified sensitivity analyses confirmed 
the robustness of the primary analysis (Table S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Prespecified 
subgroup analyses showed a beneficial effect of 
tolvaptan across subgroups that were defined 
according to sex, baseline estimated GFR, stage 
of chronic kidney disease (except for stage 2),

and geographic region (Fig. 2A), as well as in 
subgroups of patients who were 55 years of age 
or younger and patients who were white, but not 
in the smaller subgroups of patients who were 
older than 55 years of age, who were nonwhite, 
or who had chronic kidney disease of stage 2.
Key Secondary End Point
The mean slopes of the change in the estimated 
GFR at 1 year, with adjustment for the duration 
of the trial and the acute effect of tolvaptan, 
were −3.16±0.14 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 (95% 
CI, −3.43 to −2.89) in the tolvaptan group, as 
compared with −4.17±0.14 ml per minute per 
1.73 m2 (95% CI, −4.45 to −3.89) in the placebo 
group (difference, 1.01 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 
95% CI, 0.62 to 1.40; P<0.001). Subgroup analy-
ses of the secondary end point showed a benefi-
cial effect of tolvaptan in the subgroups that were 
defined according to sex, baseline estimated 
GFR, stage of chronic kidney disease (except for 
stage 2), and geographic region, as well as in 
subgroups of patients who were 55 years of age 
or younger and patients who were white, but not 
in the smaller subgroups of patients who were 
older than 55 years of age, who were nonwhite, 
or who had chronic kidney disease of stage 2. 
Details are provided in Figure S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
The changes from baseline in the estimated 
GFR during the single-blind tolvaptan period 
and their rapid reversal after patients were ran-
domly assigned to the placebo group and after 
the discontinuation of the trial regimen in the 
tolvaptan group, as well as the treatment effect 
of tolvaptan at the end of the trial, are shown in 
Figure 2B, and in Table S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix. A prespecified sensitivity analysis of 
the slopes of the change in the estimated GFR 
during the double-blind period showed a slow-
er decline with tolvaptan than with placebo 
(−3.24±0.17 vs. −4.08±0.17 ml per minute per 
1.73 m2) (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Adverse Events
During the double-blind period, the rates of new 
or worsening adverse events did not differ sub-
stantially between the tolvaptan group and the 
placebo group (85.3% and 82.3%, respectively) 
(Table 2). The rates of new or worsening adverse 
events (occurring in >5% of the patients) during 
the single-blind tolvaptan period were higher 
than the rates among the patients who received 
tolvaptan during the double-blind period. After 
randomization, patients who received tolvaptan 
had higher rates of polyuria, nocturia, thirst, 
polydipsia, dry mouth, diarrhea, and fatigue, 
whereas those who received placebo had higher 
rates of peripheral edema, kidney pain, and uri-
nary tract infection. Most adverse events during 
the trial were mild or moderate in severity.
During the single-blind tolvaptan period, ad-
verse events led to the discontinuation of tolvap-
tan in 101 of 1491 patients (6.8%). Most of the 
events in these patients (in 68 of 1491 [4.6%]) 
were related to aquaresis (Table 2).
During the double-blind period, adverse events 
led to the discontinuation of the trial regimen in 
65 of 681 patients (9.5%) receiving tolvaptan, as 
compared with 15 of 685 (2.2%) receiving pla-
cebo, including adverse events related to aquare-
sis in 14 patients in the tolvaptan group (2.1%), 
as compared with 1 (0.1%) in the placebo group, 
and hepatic enzyme abnormalities in 11 patients 
(1.6%) in the tolvaptan group, as compared with 
1 (0.1%) in the placebo group. One patient in the 
placebo group died during the trial owing to a 
motor vehicle accident. One patient died during 
Figure 1 (facing page). Patient Enrollment and Outcomes.
A total of 2292 patients were screened; 1519 patients 
entered the placebo run­in period and 1496 entered the 
tolvaptan dose­adjustment and run­in period. A total 
of 126 patients (8.4%) discontinued before randomiza­
tion. The remaining 1370 patients (91.6%) were random­
ly assigned to receive tolvaptan (683 patients) or placebo 
(687). A total of 1313 patients (95.8%) completed the 
visit at month 12 (95.8% of the patients in the tolvap­
tan group and 95.9% of those in the placebo group), 
1215 (88.7%) of whom were still taking the trial regimen 
(84.6% of the patients in the tolvaptan group and 92.7% 
of those in the placebo group) and 98 (7.2%) of whom 
had discontinued the regimen (11.1% of the patients in 
the tolvaptan group and 3.2% of those in the placebo 
group). A total of 29 patients (4.2%) assigned to receive 
tolvaptan and 28 (4.1%) assigned to receive placebo 
discontinued the trial. Patients who discontinued early 
with measurements of the serum creatinine level with­
in the prespecified follow­up period of 7 to 40 days after 
the discontinuation of the trial regimen (14 patients in 
the tolvaptan group and 4 in the placebo group) were 
included in the modified intention­to­treat population 
for the primary efficacy end point. Of the remaining 
patients who discontinued early, 12 in the tolvaptan 
group and 19 in the placebo group had some post­
randomization data that allowed them to be included 
in the modified intention­to­treat population for the 
key secondary efficacy end point. Reasons for exclu­
sion from the primary efficacy analysis are provided  
in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix.

Panel A shows a forest plot of the effect of tolvaptan versus placebo, overall and according to baseline subgroups. The overall annualized 
mean (±SE) change was −2.34±0.24 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body­surface area in the tolvaptan group, as compared with −3.61±0.24 
ml per minute per 1.73 m2 in the placebo group (difference, 1.27 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.68; P<0.001). The primary 
 
efficacy analysis included patients who completed the trial or who discontinued early with follow­up within the prespecified period of 7 to 
40 days; some additional patients who discontinued but had postrandomization data were included in the analysis of the key secondary end 
point. Panel B shows the changes from baseline (i) in the estimated GFR that were due to the renal hemodynamic effect of tolvaptan during 
the single­blind tolvaptan period (ii) and the rapid reversal of these changes after randomization into the placebo group (iii) and after dis­
continuation of the drug in the tolvaptan group (iv); the vertical lines indicate these four time periods ([i] through [iv]). The red bar along 
the x axis indicates the period during which patients received placebo, and the blue bar the period during which patients received tolvaptan. 
Plus signs on the x axis indicate trial visits at which the estimated GFR was assessed and visits that were used in the analyses of the primary 
and secondary end points. Numerical values are provided in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix. A prespecified sensitivity analysis of 
the slopes of change in the estimated GFR during the double­blind period is shown in Figure S3 in the Supplementary Appendix.

pared with 36 of 685 (5.3%) receiving placebo 
(Table 2). A total of 31 patients (4.6%) receiving 
tolvaptan had serious hepatic adverse events, as 
compared with 4 (0.6%) receiving placebo. Eleva-
tions in the alanine aminotransferase level that 
exceeded three times the upper limit of the nor-
mal range occurred in 38 patients (5.6%) receiv-
ing tolvaptan, as compared with 8 (1.2%) receiv-
ing placebo (Fig. 3). In all cases, the elevated 
liver-enzyme levels returned to normal after the 
interruption or discontinuation of treatment. No 
reports of persistent sequelae have been re-
ceived, and no patients had concurrent eleva-
tions in the bilirubin level to more than two 
times the upper limit of the normal range. De-
tails are provided in Figures S4 and S5 in the

Tolvaptan in Later-Stage ADPKD
[±SD] 47±8 years of age) who could take the 
treatment without an unacceptable level of side 
effects resulted in a slower decline than placebo 
in the estimated GFR from baseline to follow-up 
(net difference in the change in the estimated 
GFR at 1 year, 1.27 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 
95% CI, 0.86 to 1.68). The treatment effect on 
the secondary end point, the evaluation of which 
depended on modeling assumptions to adjust for 
the estimated hemodynamic on-treatment effect 
of tolvaptan24,25 and is therefore less accurate, 
overlapped with that of the primary end point 
(net difference in the change in the slope of the 
estimated GFR at 1 year, 1.01 ml per minute per 
1.73 m2; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.40). These treatment 
effects are similar to the 1.20 ml per minute per 
1.73 m2 per year that was seen in the TEMPO 3:4 
trial (annualized difference from baseline to 
follow-up; data on file), which involved patients 
with early-stage ADPKD (mean [±SD] estimated 
GFR, 81.6±29.6 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 at 
39±7 years of age).16 Furthermore, the estimated 
GFR benefit that was accumulated in the tolvap-
tan group, as compared with the placebo group, 
in the 3 years of the TEMPO 3:4 trial (3.34 ml 
per minute per 1.73 m2, P<0.001) was maintained 
2 years later (3.15 ml per minute per 1.73 m2, 
P<0.001) in the TEMPO 4:4 open-label extension 
study, in which all patients were treated with 
tolvaptan.17
The investigation of whether the treatment 
effect in the present 1-year trial would also occur 
in subsequent years is needed in order to ascer-
tain the potential long-term benefit. Although

Adverse events that occurred during the trial and serious adverse events were categorized according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA), version 20. Adverse events during the trial were defined as adverse events that were reported as starting or worsening 
(i.e., developing greater severity, becoming serious, or leading to discontinuation of the trial regimen or to death) after the initiation of the 
trial regimen. An event that started in one period and resolved completely may have been reported if it restarted at any severity in a subse­
quent period after resolution. An ongoing adverse event that was first reported in one trial period and continued into another period without 
fully resolving was not reported for subsequent trial periods if it continued with similar or lesser severity. An adverse event may also have 
been reported in a later period if it increased in severity, became serious, or led to discontinuation or death. Serious adverse events were 
 
defined as adverse events that were life­threatening or that resulted in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, 
persistent or clinically significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly 
or birth defect. ULN denotes upper limit of the normal range.
†  
The five liver­related standardized MedDRA queries (SMQs) included adverse events related to cholestasis and jaundice of hepatic origin; 
hepatic failure, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and other liver damage–related conditions; noninfectious hepatitis; liver­related investigations, signs, and 
symptoms; and liver­related coagulation and bleeding disturbances.
‡  
Aquaretic adverse events included polyuria, nocturia, thirst, dry mouth, and polydipsia.
§  
One patient died during the tolvaptan dose­adjustment phase before randomization owing to complications of a clinically silent infection 
that was unknown to the investigators at the time of enrollment. This death was deemed by the investigators not to be related to tolvaptan. 
One patient in the placebo group died during the 1­year, double­blind period of the trial owing to a motor vehicle accident.
¶  
The most common adverse events during the trial were defined as adverse events that occurred in more than 5% of patients during the single­
blind tolvaptan period or in more than 5% of the patients in either group during the double­blind period.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
that information cannot be determined from the 
present trial, a post hoc analysis of data from 
patients with chronic kidney disease of stage 3 
in the TEMPO 3:4 trial showed a treatment ef-
fect of 1.67 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 per year, 
which was incremental over the 3 years of that 
trial.26 In the present trial, the baseline esti-
mated GFR was 41.1 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 
and declined over a 1-year period by 4.17 ml per 
minute per 1.73 m2 with placebo. If one assumes 
that tolvaptan treatment would continue to slow 
the decrement in the estimated GFR by 1.27 ml 
per minute per 1.73 m2 per year, the time to 
chronic kidney disease of stage 5 would be ex-
tended from 6.2 years to 9.0 years. A larger 
benefit might be expected if treatment were 
started earlier, assuming that patients would be 
able to take the agent over time without an unac-
ceptable level of adverse events.
The design of the present trial benefited from 
the experience in the TEMPO 3:4 trial,19 in which 
72 of 961 patients (7.5%) who had been randomly 
assigned to receive tolvaptan discontinued the 
drug because of aquaretic adverse events.16,29 To 
limit early withdrawals, a randomized with-
drawal design was successfully used to enrich 
the trial for patients who were able to take 
tolvaptan without an unacceptable level of ad-
verse effects.21 However, this design limits the 
broad applicability of our results, because a group 
of patients who had side effects with tolvaptan 
were removed from consideration.
Despite the more advanced stage of disease 
in the patients involved in the present trial, the 
safety profile of tolvaptan did not differ from 
that observed in the TEMPO 3:4 trial. In these 
two trials, elevations in the liver-enzyme levels 
occurred between 60 days and 240 days after the 
initiation of tolvaptan and became less frequent 
thereafter. Two patients in the TEMPO 3:4 trial 
and one in the TEMPO 4:4 study, which used 
monitoring once every 4 months, had laboratory 
and clinical evidence of potentially serious drug-
induced liver injury, meeting Hy’s law criteria 
(serum alanine aminotransferase level of >3 times 
the upper limit of the normal range and biliru-
bin level of >2 times the upper limit of the nor-
mal range).18 In the present trial, in which 
monthly monitoring was used, no cases of eleva-
tions in the liver-enzyme and bilirubin levels 
met Hy’s law criteria; this finding is possibly due 
to more frequent monitoring and earlier inter-
ruption of therapy.
A prespecified subgroup analysis suggested 
that tolvaptan had less of an effect in patients 
older than 55 years of age. These patients, who 
because of their age were expected to have more 
advanced disease,30,31 were required to have an 
estimated GFR of 25 to 44 ml per minute per 
1.73 m2 and historical evidence of a decline in 
the estimated GFR that exceeded 2.0 ml per 
minute per 1.73 m2 per year. Despite these pre-
requisites, the decline in the estimated GFR in 
these patients was faster than the expected age-
related decline of 0.50 to 0.75 ml per minute per 
Figure 3. Time to First Elevation of Alanine Aminotransferase Level to More 
Than Three Times the Upper Limit of the Normal Range (ULN).
Shown is the first elevation of the alanine aminotransferase level to more 
than three times the ULN during the double­blind period in a time­to­event 
analysis. Elevations started approximately 2 to 3 months after the initiation 
of the trial regimen and continued for the 12­month trial period. The hepatic 
adjudication committee deemed that elevations in 11 patients were proba­
bly related to tolvaptan; the time to the first elevation to more than three 
times the ULN is indicated by an arrowhead for each patient. The inset shows 
the same data on an enlarged y axis. By day 390, most patients had already 
completed the follow­up period with three blood samples for measurement 
of the serum creatinine level. The hepatic adjudication committee deemed 
two additional hepatic events with alanine aminotransferase elevations of 
less than three times the ULN (data not shown) to be probably related to 
tolvaptan. Three patients had an increase in the alanine aminotransferase 
level to more than three times the ULN during the single­blind period (data 
not shown).

Tolvaptan in Later-Stage ADPKD
1.73 m2 per year in the general population of 
patients older than 40 years of age32 but was 
much slower than the decline in patients 55 years 
of age or younger who had similar stages of 
chronic kidney disease in the present trial. Thus, 
this older population in our trial appeared to be 
enriched for slowly progressive disease, in which 
case it may be more difficult to show a treat-
ment benefit.
The present trial has certain limitations. The 
selection of participants mainly on the basis of 
the estimated GFR was justified by the fact that 
the estimated GFR is an excellent predictor of 
disease progression when the rate is already de-
clining.33,34 Nevertheless, it remains possible that 
additional selection criteria regarding genotype 
or age-adjusted total kidney volume could have 
further enriched the trial population for patients 
who would have rapid disease progression.30,31 
We did not study whether the effect of tolvaptan 
on the estimated GFR was mediated or paral-
leled by an effect on kidney volume; renal hemo-
dynamic or other mechanisms could have also 
played a role.27,28,35 The patients in the trial were 
asked to maintain good hydration. By increasing 
hydration and suppressing vasopressin release 
in the patients in the placebo group, the benefit 
that was associated with the administration of 
tolvaptan may have been underestimated. The 
conclusions regarding treatment benefit were not 
based on a hard end point such as a 50% decline 
in the estimated GFR or end-stage renal disease. 
The short duration of the trial limited the abil-
ity to assess adverse events over the medium or 
long term.
In conclusion, the results of the present trial 
showed that tolvaptan slowed the progressive loss 
of renal function in patients with ADPKD at stages 
that were more advanced than those of the pa-
tients who were included in the TEMPO 3:4 trial. 
Monthly monitoring of liver-enzyme levels prob-
ably reduced the frequency of drug-induced liver 
injury. The long-term effectiveness of treatment 
with tolvaptan remains to be determined.
