virus envelope protein domain III 
induce potent neutralizing immune 
responses in mice

Several Zika virus (ZIKV) vaccine candidates have recently been described which use inactivated 
whole virus, DNA or RNA that express the virus’ Envelope (E) glycoprotein as the antigen. These were 
successful in stimulating production of virus-targeted antibodies that protected animals against ZIKV 
challenges, but their use potentially will predispose vaccinated individuals to infection by the related 
Dengue virus (DENV). We have devised a virus like particle (VLP) carrier based on the hepatitis B core 
antigen (HBcAg) that displays the ZIKV E protein domain III (zDIII), and shown that it can be produced 
quickly and easily purified in large quantities from Nicotiana benthamiana plants. HBcAg-zDIII VLPs are 
shown to be highly immunogenic, as two doses elicited potent humoral and cellular responses in mice 
that exceed the threshold correlated with protective immunity against multiple strains of Zika virus. 
Notably, HBcAg-zDIII VLPs-elicited antibodies did not enhance the infection of DENV in Fc gamma 
receptor-expressing cells, offsetting the concern of ZIKV vaccines inducing cross-reactive antibodies 
and sensitizing people to subsequent DENV infection. Thus, our zDIII-based vaccine offers improved 
safety and lower cost production than other current alternatives, with equivalent effectiveness.
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in humans used to be described as a self-limiting febrile illness with symptoms of 
rash, headache, and myalgia. However, recent ZIKV outbreaks have linked ZIKV to the development of severe 
fetal abnormalities that include microcephaly and Guillain-Barre’ syndrome in adults1, 2. Over 1.5 million people 
were infected with ZIKV in Brazil in 2015 alone, and tens of millions more could be infected in the Americas 
in the coming years3. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics available to combat this virus. 
Therefore, there is an urgent call to develop effective and safe vaccines to prevent ZIKV infection.
ZIKV belongs to the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae, and is closely related to the four serotypes 
of dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Japanese encephalitis 
virus (JEV), and yellow fever virus (YFV)4. Similar to other flaviviruses, the ZIKV Envelope (zE) glycoprotein is 
composed of three ectodomains (EDI, EDII, and EDIII)5 and is responsible for mediating viral assembly, attach-
ment to cellular receptors, and the subsequent membrane fusion involved in viral entry4. The zE glycoprotein 
is also a major target of host antibody responses4 and its EDIII (zDIII) has been found to be targeted by several 
ZIKV-specific antibodies with strong neutralizing activities6. Since neutralizing antibodies have been shown to 
be correlated with protection for approved vaccines against YFV and TBEV, and to play important roles in the 
protection against infection by many flaviviruses including ZIKV6–8, zDIII is considered a prime candidate for an 
effective subunit vaccine due to its potential of inducing potent neutralizing antibodies.
The high degree of genetic similarity between ZIKV and DENV poses challenges for vaccine development 
due to the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE), which has been implicated 
for DENV infection. While antibodies generated during a primary infection of DENV are protective against 
the homologous serotype, these antibodies may be non-neutralizing or sub-neutralizing against a heterologous 
DENV serotype in a secondary infection9. Instead, these cross-reactive antibodies can enhance infection of the 
second DENV serotype in Fc gamma receptor (Fcγ
R)-expressing cells and lead to a potentially lethal shock syn-
drome through ADE10. Since ZIKV and DENV are closely related and co-circulate geographically, any ZIKV

vaccines based on common epitopes of the two viruses may have the potential to elicit cross-reactive antibodies 
that augment infection of DENV in vaccinated subjects when they are secondarily exposed to DENV. Indeed, 
a ZIKV infection can generate cross-reactive antibodies targeting the highly conserved fusion loop in EDII 
(EDII-FL), that serve to enhance DENV infection both in cell culture and in mice11, 12. Therefore, vaccine strate-
gies based on antigens that can avoid induction of cross-reactive antibodies should also minimize the risk of ADE 
of DENV infections.
Recently, vaccine candidates based on inactivated virus, lipid-nanoparticle-encapsulated nucleoside-modified 
mRNA (mRNA–LNP), and naked or adenovirus-vectored DNA that expresses ZIKV premembrane (prM) and 
E protein (prM-E) were evaluated. They all have been shown to induce neutralizing antibodies that provide pro-
tection against ZIKV challenges in both mouse and rhesus monkey models13–15. While these developments are 
encouraging, hurdles remain to be overcome on the path to license these ZIKV vaccine candidates, particularly 
in regards to safety and cost-effectiveness.
In response, we generated a zDIII-based subunit vaccine in the form of zDIII-displaying virus-like particles 
(VLPs) based on the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg). Unlike DNA-based vaccines, there is no risk of genome 
insertion or associated oncogenesis by this protein-based vaccine. Furthermore, zDIII VLPs are also safer than 
inactivated virus and viral vector-based vaccines due to the elimination of the possibility of incomplete inacti-
vation or unfavorable host responses to viral vectors. The use of zDIII, an antigen containing well-defined neu-
tralizing epitopes but avoiding epitopes with ADE pathological effects, is aimed at further enhancing the safety 
of ZIKV vaccines while maintaining their potency. We also explored the use of an HBcAg VLP carrier to display 
zDIII, and plants as a production platform to increase the immunogenicity, stability, and cost effectiveness of this 
vaccine candidate.
Results
HBcAg-zDIII expression in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. 
The coding sequence of zDIII was fused 
to the 3′
 end of the coding sequence of HBcAg and cloned into MagnICON-based plant expression vectors 
for targeting the expression of HBcAg-zDIII in the endomembrane system of plant cells via ER16 (Fig. 1). The 
Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain that contained the HBcAg-zDIII construct was agroinfiltrated into N. benth-
amiana leaves. Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the expression of HBcAg-zDIII. As shown in 
Fig. 2, a positive band with the predicted molecular weight for the HBcAg-zDIII fusion protein (31.7 Kda) was 
detected with antibodies that specifically recognize zDIII (Fig. 2A, Lane 1), indicating the expression of the fusion 
protein. The lack of a positive band in the negative control leaf samples (Fig. 2A, Lane 2) confirmed the specificity 
of the HBcAg-zDIII band. An ELISA was used to quantify the expression of HBcAg-zDIII, which showed that 
HBcAg-zDIII reached the highest level of production 7 days post agroinfiltration (DPI), with an average accumu-
lation of 1,824 μ
g/g leaf fresh weight (LFW) (Fig. 2B). This high level of expression is similar to that previously 
reported for HBcAg VLPs produced in plants, representing one of the highest expression levels of recombinant 
proteins in plants17.
Plant-expressed HBcAg-zDIII assembled into VLPs. 
Clarified plant extracts were subjected to sucrose 
gradient sedimentation. SDS-PAGE and ELISA analysis of gradient fractions showed that HBcAg-zDIII was 
detected in the particulate fractions (Fig. 3A and B). When compared with HBcAg, which is known to assemble 
into VLPs17, HBcAg-zDIII was distributed in the same fractions as the parent HBcAg molecule regardless of 
whether anti-HBcAg or anti-zDIII antibodies were used for detection in ELISA (Fig. 3B). Examination of the 
HBcAg-zDIII peak sucrose gradient fractions by electron microscopy conclusively confirmed the presence of 
typical HBcAg VLPs with a diameter of ~30 nm (Fig. 3C). The availability of an efficient purification scheme is 
essential for HBcAg-zDIII VLP to become a viable vaccine candidate. Indeed, the one-step sucrose gradient cen-
trifugation process efficiently removed most plant host proteins (Fig. 3A, Lanes 1–11) and purified HBcAg-zDIII 
to greater than 95% pure (Fig. 3D). ELISA analysis indicated that the average recovery of HBcAg-zDIII by this 
process from plant extract was 64%.
zDIII displayed by HBcAg-zDIII VLPs retained the proper folding of the native zDIII. 
To confirm 
the proper folding of zDIII displayed by the VLPs, the specific recognition of HBcAg-zDIII by two specific mon-
oclonal antibodies (mAbs), i.e. ZV54 mAb and E16 mAb, was examined. E16 was generated against WNV DIII 
and has been shown to be WNV specific and only bind to a conformational epitope on the lateral ridge of WNV 
DIII18. In contrast, ZV54 is ZIKV specific and binds a lateral ridge conformational epitope on zDIII that consists 
of 4 discontinuous structural elements of the native zDIII6. Therefore, recognition of a recombinant HBcAg-zDIII 
VLP by ZV54 will be indicative of the proper folding of its zDIII moiety. Indeed, a specific and high affinity 
(Kd = 0.2 nM) binding of HBcAg-zDIII VLP to ZV54 was demonstrated by ELISA analysis (Fig. 4). In contrast, 
HBcAg-zDIII VLP did not show any binding to E16 or 6D8, an anti-Ebola IgG isotype control (Fig. 4). Thus, these 
results indicated that zDIII was displayed on HBcAg-zDIII VLPs in a conformation that resembles the native viral 
zDIII on the surface of ZIKV, suggesting the preservation of ZIKV neutralization determinants of zDIII.
HBcAg-zDIII VLPs evoked potent and neutralizing antibody immune response in mice. 
 
C57BL/6 mice were divided into 4 groups (n = 6 per group) and received three doses of 50 μ
g HBcAg-zDIII VLPs 
subcutaneously (Fig. 5A). Mice in group 1 (the negative control group) were injected with saline buffer (PBS) 
with poly I:C + alum adjuvant. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were injected with the same amount of HBcAg-zDIII VLP but 
with different adjuvant of poly I:C (group 2), alum (group 3) or poly I:C + alum (group 4). Adjuvant was only 
used in the prime injection but not in the subsequent booster injections. zDIII-specific antibody responses from 
individual mice were measured and Geometric mean titer (GMT) was calculated for each group. The presence of 
anti-zDIII IgG was not detected in sera from the control adjuvant group throughout the immunization course or

in pre-immune serum samples for all groups collected prior to the first immunization (titer < 10) (Fig. 5B). The 
delivery of HBcAg-zDIII VLPs elicited strong zDIII-specific antibody response in all groups after the first admin-
istration (week 2, log titers > 2.55–3.1) and IgG titers reached its peak at week 5, two weeks after the first boost 
immunization (log titers > 4.2–4.9) (Fig. 5B). Antibody titers at week 8 (two weeks after the second boost) were 
similar to those of week 5 for all groups that have received HBcAg-zDIII VLPs (p = 0.44) (Fig. 5B), suggesting that 
the last immunization did not significantly further boost the zDIII-specific IgG response. Among different adju-
vant groups, the IgG titers in the poly I:C group are significantly lower than that of the alum and poly I:C + alum 
groups, especially at weeks 5 and 8 (p = 0.005 poly I:C compared with alum; p = 0.003 poly I:c compared with 
alum + poly I:C) (Fig. 5B). The amplitude of the zDIII-specific IgG response did not differ significantly between 
the alum and poly I:C + alum groups throughout the immunization scheme (p = 0.87) (Fig. 5B).

expression vector pICH11599. The A. tumefaciens strain that contains pICH11599-HBcAg-zDIII construct 
was agroinfiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves for transient expression. Leaves were harvested at 7 days post 
agroinfiltration (DPI) for HBcAg-zDIII isolation.

A plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) assay was performed to evaluate the ability of HBcAg-zDIII 
VLP-induced antibodies in conferring protection against ZIKV infection. As shown in Fig. 6, there was no reduc-
tion of ZIKV infection by sera from mice inoculated with PBS + adjuvant (Fig. 6). In contrast, anti-HBcAg-zDIII 
serum (week 5, for all three adjuvant combinations) conferred potent neutralizing effects against ZIKV infection 
(p < 0.0001 comparing anti-HBcAg-zDIII sera versus adjuvant alone sera) (Fig. 6). For example, greater than 60% 
and 80% of ZIKV infection was reduced by incubating with sera of 1/320 and 1/80 dilutions from HBcAg-zDIII 
VLP injected mice, respectively (Fig. 6). No significant difference of neutralization titer was observed for sera 
among mouse groups that received different adjuvants (p = 0.42).
HBcAg-zDIII VLPs also elicited potent cellular immune responses in mice. 
The ability of 
HBcAg-zDIII VLPs in inducing cellular immune response was investigated by measuring the production of 
cytokines by splenocytes from immunized mice after in vitro antigen stimulation. The robust production of 
cytokines by stimulation with ConA (positive control) indicated the competency of splenocytes in producing 
cytokines upon stimulation in vitro (Fig. S5). Splenocytes of mice receiving PBS + adjuvant did not produce sig-
nificant IFN-γ
 titers after in vitro stimulation with zDIII (Fig. 7). In contrast, significant levels of IFN-γ
 were pro-
duced by splenocytes from HBcAg-zDIII-injected mice (Fig. 7). Among the three adjuvant combinations, alum 
and alum + poly I:C induced strong zDIII-specific cellular immune responses as splenocytes from mice received 
HBcAg-zDIII VLPs with both of these adjuvant combinations producing similarly high levels of IFN-γ
 (p = 0.66), 
reaching a mean concentration of 48,736 pg/ml (alum adjuvant) and 38,496 pg/ml (alum + poly I:C adjuvant), 
respectively, 48hr after re-stimulation. In contrast, splenocytes from mice that received HBcAg-zDIII VLPs with 
poly I:C as adjuvant produced signifiantly lower levels of IFN-γ
 (1,522 pg/ml) (p = 0.02 compared to alum or poly 
I:C + alum as adjuvant). These results demonstrated that HBcAg-zDIII VLPs can induce potent cellular immune 
responses when appropriate adjuvants are used.
HBcAg-zDIII VLPs circumvent induction of antibodies with ADE activity for dengue virus infec-
tion. 
One of the challenges of vaccine development for ZIKV is the risk of ADE of heterologous flavivirus (e.g. 
DENV) infection. As such, we investigated if our zDIII-based antigen would avoid or have diminished ability to 
induce cross-reactive antibodies. Dilutions of IgGs isolated from sera of HBcAg-zDIII VLP-immunized mice 
were incubated with DENV-2 to evaluate their ability to infect K562 cells that express the human Fcγ
R IIA. 
4G2, an anti-DENV-2 EDII mAb that is cross-reactive with E of other flaviviruses19, efficiently promoted ADE 
of DENV-2 infection of K562 cells (Fig. 8A). In contrast, IgGs isolated from HBcAg-zDIII VLP-injected mice 
(week 5, all three adjuvant combinations) displayed no significant ADE activity for DENV-2, similar to IgGs from 
the negative control mice that received PBS and adjuvant (Fig. 8B). To ensure the lack of ADE was not caused by 
insufficient amount of anti-HBcAg-zDIII VLP IgGs in the assay, PRNT analysis was performed to demonstrate 
that IgGs at high concentrations used in the assay (0.3–3 µg/ml) had neutralizing activity against ZIKV (Fig. S6). 
Thus, our HBcAg-zDIII VLP-based vaccine has a diminished ability to elicit the production of enhancing anti-
bodies against DENV as demonstrated by this in vitro assay.

Discussion
The worldwide ZIKV epidemic, and in particular, the link of ZIKV infection with severe abnormalities during 
human fetal development underscores the urgent need for potent and safe ZIKV vaccines. Recently, several types 
of ZIKV vaccine candidates were evaluated in animal models. These studies demonstrated that an inactivated 
ZIKV, a plasmid DNA, and an mRNA–LNP that all express ZIKV prM-E provided complete protection against 
ZIKV challenges in both mouse and non-human primate models13–15. Moreover, a recombinant adenovirus vec-
tor vaccine that expresses the same ZIKV prM-E protein also provided protection in resus monkeys against ZIKV 
challenge14. These studies also established that protection against various ZIKV strains including those from 
Brazil (Brazil ZKV2015) and Puerto Rico (PRVABC59) can be mediated by vaccine-evoked anti-zE IgG alone, 
and protective efficacy correlate with E-specific antibody titers (log titers > 2.35–3.2) and neutralization antibody 
titers (>10)13. While all of these vaccine candidates show great promise, there are still challenges that need to be 
addressed, particularly in regards to their safety and cost-effectiveness. For example, risk factors associated with 
incomplete inactivation of live ZIKV, unfavorable host responses to viral vectors, and the potential of ADE of het-
erologous flavivirus infection all spur the development of safer ZIKV vaccines, particularly for pregnant women. 
The wide-spread ZIKV epidemic also calls for a production platform that can rapidly produce ZIKV vaccines at 
a large-scale and affordable cost.
It has recently been shown that zDIII is the E protein domain that contains epitopes of potently neutralizing 
antibodies6. These anti-zDIII antibodies effectively neutralize African, Asian and American strains of ZIKV and 
many of them protect mice against lethal ZIKV challenges6. Importantly, these antibodies are ZIKV specific 
and, therefore, do not bind and enhance heterologous flavivirus infection through ADE. These findings and the 
ability of DIII of flaviviruses to independently fold into a functional domain20 suggest the promise of zDIII as an

not in the subsequent booster injections. Blood samples were collected on weeks -1 (preimmune bleed), 2, 5,

appealing vaccine candidate. In this study, we explored the possibility of producing zDIII in the form of a VLP 
and characterized its immunogenicity and safety in mice. We also tested the ability of plants as a production plat-
form for zDIII VLP-based vaccines, aiming to address the scalability and cost issues.
Our results revealed that HBcAg-zDIII VLPs (50 µg, equivalent to 15 µg zDIII antigen) with all three adjuvant 
combinations elicited a potent zE-specific humoral response with zDIII-specific IgG titers (log titer) and ZIKV 
neutralization titers being minimally >4.2 and >320, respectively, at week 5, significantly exceeding the threshold 
of zE-specific (>2.35–3.2) and neutralizing antibody titers (>10) required for protection against various ZIKV 
strains in the mouse model. Combined with the findings that (1) the majority of epitopes that induce protective 
immunity against flavivirus are localized on EDIII21, 22 and (2) mice were effectively protected in lethal challenges 
from several strains of ZIKV by zDIII-specific antibodies6, our results suggest that zDIII-VLPs with poly I:C or 
alum as adjuvant can be as potent as the reported DNA or inactivated virus-based vaccines in evoking humoral 
response against ZIKV and may also provide protective immunity in mice.

The induction of significant levels of IFN-γ
 demonstrates that HBcAg-zDIII VLPs can also evoke robust cel-
lular responses in mice. The production of high titers of IFN-γ
 suggests that a Th1-type or a mixed Th1/Th2 cel-
lular immune response was elicited by HBcAg-zDIII VLPs. Generally, a Th1 or Th1/Th2 mixed response is more 
preferable than a Th2-type for preventing and treating viral infection23. Our results indicate that HBcAg-zDIII 
VLP-based vaccines not only can provide sterilizing immunity, but also have the potential to clear ZIKV infec-
tion. In this study, alum and poly I:C were explored as adjuvant in three formats: alum alone, poly I:C alone, 
and poly I:C + alum. Alum has been approved as an adjuvant for human applications and poly I:C is a syn-
thetic analog of double-stranded RNA and a ligand of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)24. It has been shown that 
TLR3 activation is important for promoting immunity and protection against flavivirus infection25. Our results 
indicate that co-delivery of HBcAg-zDIII VLPs with alum or poly I:C + alum induced significantly higher titers 
of zDIII-specific antibodies and cytokines than with poly I:C alone, although all three adjuvant combinations 
evoked ZIKV-neutralizing antibody titers that are higher than that required for protection against multiple ZIKV 
strains. The ability of HBcAg-zDIII VLPs with alum as adjuvant in inducing strong neutralizing humoral and 
cellular responses suggests the potential human application of zDIII-based VLP vaccines.
The use of zDIII-VLP based ZIKV vaccines offers several advantages over the published DNA, inactivated 
virus, adenovirus vector, or mRNA–LNP-based vaccine candidates. First, HBcAg-zDIII VLPs, a protein-based 
vaccine, will have the best safety profile compared with other vaccine platforms due to the virtual nonexistence 
of possible incomplete inactivation, oncogenesis by genome insertion, or unfavorable host responses to viral vec-
tors. Additionally, we carefully chose zDIII as the antigen to target well-defined neutralizing epitopes but avoid 
epitopes with pathological effects. This measure is particularly crucial for vaccine development against ZIKV and 
other flaviviruses due to the risk of ADE. For example, individuals who were infected or vaccinated against one 
serotype of DENV are at a higher risk of developing dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/
DSS) when they are later exposed to another serotype of DENV9. This enhancement of disease severity is most 
likely caused by ADE because many antibodies generated against the first DENV serotype are cross-reactive 
but sub-neutralizing against the second serotype of DENV. As a result, the new serotype forms complexes with 
these antibodies that bind to Fcγ
R-bearing myeloid cells, promoting viral uptake and infection10. In fact, the 
risk of ADE by vaccination has been demonstrated by a JEV vaccine. Immunization with this vaccine has been 
shown to enhance the infection of all four serotypes of DENV through ADE26. Due to their common mosquito 
vectors and geographical distributions, ZIKV and DENV will continue to co-circulate in many areas of the world. 
Importantly, antibodies against DENV and ZIKV have been found to enhance the replication of each other in 
vitro, strongly indicating ADE may occur between these two closely-related viral diseases11, 12, 27. As such, min-
imizing the ADE risk of heterologous flavivirus infection should be an important consideration for any ZIKV 
vaccine development. Recent studies reveal that the FL and the adjacent region of ZIKV EDII (zDII) contain the 
majority of the exposed residues conserved between ZIKV and other flavivirus E proteins28. Likewise, the major-
ity of DENV cross-reactive but subneutralizing antibodies in human humoral response to ZIKV E protein are 
targeted to epitopes on zEDII or domain I (zEDI)12, which is consistent with the findings in other flaviviruses29, 30. 
In contrast, antibodies against zDIII epitopes are overall ZIKV-specific, have potent neutralizing activity, and are 
protective against ZIKV challenge in mice6, 12. Notably, zDIII-specific antibodies did not show ADE activity for 
DENV infection while zEDI/zEDII-specific antibodies enhanced DENV infection both in vitro and in vivo12. Of 
note, our results directly demonstrated that antibodies elicited by zDIII VLPs did not enhance DENV infection. 
These results indicate that our zDIII-based vaccine may provide additional safety advantages over the current 
candidates based on inactivated virus, DNA, or adenovirus vector, which all contain zDI/zDII and can potentially 
induce zDI/zDII-targeted subneutralizing antibodies and enhance DENV infection in vaccinated subjects. This 
safety issue is particularly important for ZIKV vaccines, where women or pregnant women make up the majority 
of the target population.
We choose to use HBcAg to display zDIII because numerous studies have demonstrated the 
immune-enhancing properties of HBcAg VLP due to the multimeric presentation of antigenic determinant on 
its surface and the presence of strong helper T cell epitopes within the HBcAg structure31. Furthermore, it has 
been shown that the immunodominance of some HBcAg VLP epitopes can be transferred to foreign sequences 
that are inserted/conjugated into these sites32, 33. For these reasons, HBcAg was the first VLP tested as a vaccine 
carrier to enhance immunogenicity of vaccines and has been shown to be effective in animal models and safe in 
multiple human clinical trials31. Like other carrier VLPs, HBcAg can also induce antibody responses to the car-
rier itself34. While it would be intriguing to investigate the extend of HBcAg carrier-specific responses elicited by 
HBcAg-zDIII VLPs in the future, extensive studies have shown that carrier-specific antibody responses to HBcAg 
are often mild and do not have significant negative influences on the immunogenicity of the foreign epitopes 
displayed by HBcAg VLPs34, 35. For example, carrier-specific anti-HBcAg antibodies were found to have minimal 
effect on the antigen presentation, the induction of antigen-specific antibody and cytotoxic T-cell responses, and 
the protective immunity of antigens that are displayed by HBcAg VLPs34–36. The induction of carrier-specific 
antibodies may also prevent the use of the vaccine in populations that have pre-exposure to hepatitis B virus. 
However, this challenge can be addressed by using the core antigen derived from nonhuman hepadnaviruses. 
For example, several core VLPs derived from the rodent hepadnaviruses have been found to be as immunogenic 
as the human-derived HBcAg VLPs, but are not burdened by the problem of pre-existing immunity or immune 
tolerance to a human pathogen37.
The successful production of HBcAg-zDIII VLPs in plants also helps to address the economic issues of vac-
cines. Since the production of plant biomass and plant-derived proteins can be scaled-up without high-capital 
investments of cell-culture facilities or bioreactors and expensive tissue culture media, the cost of plant-produced 
biologics can be greatly reduced38. Indeed, recent case studies have confirmed the long-held belief that 
plant-produced biologics is more cost effective than traditional platforms. For example, it was shown that 
plant-based platforms can substantially reduce the upstream production cost of biologics to as low as $1.00–2.00

per kilogram of protein39, 40. Our results showed that HBcAg-zDIII VLPs were accumulated rapidly at a high level 
of 1,824 μ
g/g LFW in N. benthamiana leaves, which is considered more than sufficient for vaccine manufacturing. 
This expression level under small-scale laboratory conditions can be further increased by process optimization 
utilizing industrial-scale plant growth conditions41. Plant-produced HBcAg-zDIII VLPs were readily extracted 
and purified from leaves with a simple, one-step purification process, which has been shown to be compliant with 
current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations and are broadly used for the production of VLP-based 
vaccines41. Thus, the quick and high-level accumulation of HBcAg-zDIII VLPs and their facile purification with 
high percentage of recovery indicate the potential of plants as a feasible platform for producing HBcAg-zDIII 
VLPs and other subunit vaccines with favorable costs and scalability. A detailed technoeconomic study is required 
to determine the exact cost-saving benefit of using plants for HBcAg-zDIII VLP production when manufactur-
ing data become publicly available. However, if the cost advantage is significant, it will allow the production of 
affordable ZIKV vaccines for the developing world, where the majority of ZIKV cases exists.
In summary, we have demonstrated the robust production of HBcAg-zDIII VLP, its effective display of zDIII 
antigen and facile purification, its potent immunogenicity that correlates with protective immunity against 
multiple ZIKV strains, and the lack of ADE for DENV infection. To our knowledge, this is the first report of 
a protein-based, VLP ZIKV vaccine that induces neutralizing immunity but circumvents induction of anti-
bodies with ADE activity for DENV infection. Altogether, our study has provided the proof-of-principle and 
feasibility necessary for the further development of more potent, affordable, and potentially safer recombinant 
protein-based subunit vaccines against the worldwide ZIKV epidemic.
Material and Methods
Construction of DIII expression vectors. 
The coding DNA sequence of ZIKV E protein of strain 
PRVABC59 (amino acid 1–403, Genbank Acc.No. AMC13911) was synthesized with optimized N. benthami-
ana codons (Integrated DNA Technologies, IA). The coding sequences of zDIII (amino acid 303–403 of E pro-
tein) and HBcAg (amino acid 1–155)17 were amplified by PCR with primer pairs (GTTTCTTACTCTCTTTGC, 
AGGAGCTCTCAAGATCCAAAATCCCAAGC) and (ACCATGGACAT TGACCCT TAC, 
GCAAAGAGAGTAAGAAACACCCCTGTCCCTTCTTCG), respectively. The DNA sequence of zDIII was 
fused to the 3′
 of HBcAg sequence by overlapping PCR with primers ACCATGGACATTGACCCTTAC and 
AGGAGCTCTCAAGATCCAAAATCCCAAGC. The coding sequence of HBcAg-zDIII fusion protein was then 
cloned into the TMV-based expression vector pIC11599 of the MagnICON system18, 42 (Fig. 1).
Expression of HBcAg-zDIII in N. benthamiana leaves. 
Plant expression vectors were transformed into 
A. tumefaciens GV3101 by electroporation as previously described43. N. benthamiana plants were grown and 
co-agroinfiltrated with the GV3101 strain containing the HBcAg-zDIII 3′
 module (pICH11599-HBcAg-zDIII) 
along with its 5′
 TMV module (pICH20999 for ER targeting) and an integrase construct (pICH14011) as 
described previously44–46.
zDIII expression in E. coli. 
The PCR fragment of the zDIII coding sequence was cloned into the pET28a 
bacterial expression plasmid (EMD Milipore, MA) with EcoRI and HindIII sites. zDIII was expressed in E. coli 
and purified using an oxidative refolding protocol as described previously20, 47. Purified zDIII was used in western 
blot and ELISA analysis.
Extraction and purification of HBcAg-zDIII VLP from N. benthamiana leaves. 
Agroinfiltrated N. 
benthamiana leaves were harvested at 5–8 DPI for evaluating HBcAg-zDIII VLP expression. Leaves were har-
vested at 7 DPI for other protein analysis. Leaves were homogenized in extraction buffer (PBS, pH 5.2, 1 mM 
EDTA, 2 mM PMSF (Sigma, Germany)) at 1.5 ml/g LFW. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 ×
 g 
for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated for 12 hr at 4 °C, and then spun at 15,000 ×
 g for 30 min at 4 °C. 
The supernatant was recovered and pH adjusted to 7.0. The supernatant was then subjected to a sucrose gradient 
sedimentation as described previously17. Briefly, clarified plant extracts were layered onto linear 10–70% sucrose 
gradients dissolved in PBS (pH 7.0). After centrifugation at 175,000 ×
 g for 12 h at 4 °C, 32 fractions were collected 
and assayed for HBcAg and zDIII content and VLP assembly by ELISA, SDS-PAGE, and electron microscopy.
SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and ELISAs. 
Samples containing HBcAg-zDIII were subjected to 12% 
SDS-PAGE or 4–20% SDS-PAGE under a reducing (5% v/v β
-mercaptoethanol) condition as described pre-
viously42. Gels were either stained with Coomassie blue or used to transfer proteins onto PVDF membranes 
(MilliporeSigma, MA). Membranes were first incubated with a zDIII-specific mouse mAb (a gift from Dr. M. 
Diamond, Washington University) to detect the zDIII component of the fusion protein. Membranes were sub-
sequently incubated with a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Southern 
Biotech, AL). Specific bindings were detected using an “ECL” Western blot detection system (Thermo Fisher, IL). 
Western blots and stain gels were scanned. The purity of HBcAg-zDIII VLP was quantitated using a densitometer 
(ChemiDoc Imager, Bio-Rad, CA) and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, CA) by analyzing protein bands stained 
with Coomassie blue on SDS-PAGE as described previously48.
The temporal expression pattern of HBcAg-zDIII was examined by an ELISA that detects HBcAg. Briefly, 
plates were coated with the plant protein extract. An HRP-conjugated anti-HBcAg mAb (Abcam, MA) was used 
as the detection antibody. Purified HBcAg17 was used as a reference standard. The plates were then developed 
with Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate and read at 450 nm (KPL Inc, MA). HBcAg-zDIII levels in sucrose 
gradient fractions were also measured by the same ELISA procedure.
The specific recognition of HBcAg VLP-displayed zDIII by mAbs that bind to ZIKV DIII-specific conforma-
tional epitopes was determined by ELISA as described previously49. Purified HBcAg-zDIII VLP was immobilized

on microtiter plates and incubated with ZV54, a mAb that only binds a lateral ridge conformational epitope on 
zDIII6. An HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse-IgG antibody (Southern Biotech, AL) was used to detect bound anti-
bodies. A mAb that recognizes the equivalent epitope on the DIII of WNV (E16)50 was used as a negative control. 
The binding data was used for a non-linear regression analysis using a one-site binding model (GraphPad Prism 
software, version 7.0, GraphPad, CA) to determine the affinity (Kd) of zDIII binding to ZV54.
ELISAs were also used to determine the titers of zDIII-specific IgG in mouse serum as previously described43. 
Specifically, microtiter plates were coated with zDIII, blocked with PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 
and incubated with a serial dilution of serum. Subsequently, the plates were incubated with an HRP-conjugated 
goat anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotech, AL), washed with PBS, and developed with TMB substrate. All ELISA 
measurements were repeated at least three times with each sample in triplicate. Endpoint titers were defined as the 
highest reciprocal serum dilution that yielded an OD450 >2-fold over background values. GMT was calculated for 
each group at various time points, and was used to express the titers of the zDIII-specific total IgG.
Electron microscopy. 
Purified HBcAg-zDIII VLPs were subjected to negative staining with 0.5% aque-
ous uranyl acetate, and transmission electron microscopy was performed with a Philips CM-12S microscope as 
described previously51, 52.
Neutralization Assay. 
ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibodies were measured with a PRNT assay as previ-
ously described53. Briefly, ZIKV (PRVABC59, ATCC# VR-1843) was diluted in Opti-MEM medium to a working 
concentration of 100 plaque-forming units (PFU) per well. ZIKV was then added to the two-fold serially diluted 
serum and incubated for 1 hr at 37 °C. Virus/serum mixture was subsequently transferred to plates containing 
confluent Vero cells (ATCC # CCL-81) and incubated for 1 hr at 37 °C. After removing the virus/serum-containing 
medium, cells were overlaid with fresh MEM medium containing 5% FBS and 0.8% agarose (Invitrogen, CA), 
incubated for an additional 3 days at 37 °C, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, MilliporeSigma, MA), and then 
stained with 0.2% crystal violet. Percent (%) neutralization was calculated as: [(number of ZIKV plaque per well 
without anti-zDIII serum)-(number of ZIKV plaque per well of diluted anti-zDIII serum)/(number of ZIKV 
plaque per well without anti-zDIII serum) ×
100]. Neutralizing antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal 
of the highest dilution of serum that neutralized ≥
50% of ZIKV. Experiments were repeated at least three times.
Antibody-dependent enhancement assay. 
Sera from vaccinated mice were pooled and total IgG was 
isolated using IgG purification kits (GE Healthcare, PA). DENV-2 (ATCC#VR-1584) was mixed with each of 
eight 3-fold serial dilutions of IgG or an anti-DENV-2 E domain II mAb (4G2) (ATCC # HB-112) as positive 
control, respectively. The antibody-DENV-2 mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for one hour before adding to 
FcgRIIA+ K562 cells (ATCC # CCL-2243) at an MOI of 1.0. The K562 cells were then incubated at 37 °C with 
5% CO2 for 48hr. DENV-2 infected cells were collected, fixed and permeabilized then fluorescently labeled. The 
percentage of infected cells was determined by flow cytometry as described previously53.
Mouse immunization. 
All animal work was performed in accordance with the guidelines of National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) for the care and use of laboratory animals and approved by the Arizona State University 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Six-week old female C57BL/6 mice were divided into 4 
groups (n = 6 per group). Mice in group 1 received PBS with aluminum hydroxide gel (alum, InvivoGen, CA) + poly 
I:C (InvivoGen, CA) as a mock immunized control. Groups 2, 3, and 4 received 50 μ
g of HBcAg-zDIII VLP per 
dosage with poly I:C, alum, and poly I:C + alum as adjuvant, respectively. On Day 0, each mouse was injected sub-
cutaneously with 100 μ
l of PBS or 50 μ
g purified HBcAg-zDIII VLP in PBS in the indicated adjuvant. Mice were 
boosted on days 21 and 42 using the same dosage of antigen as in the 1st immunization but without any adjuvant. 
Blood samples were collected from the retro-orbital vein on days 14 (week 2), 35 (week 5) and 56 (week 8) after the 
1st immunization. Pre-immune serum samples were also collected on Day −
7 (week −
1) prior to immunization. 
Mice were euthanized on day 63 (week 9) and the spleens were aseptically removed for in vitro splenocyte cultures.
Cytokine production in spleen cell culture. 
A mechanical dissociation method was used to prepare 
single-cell suspension of the spleens from immunized mice as published previously47. Splenocytes were resus-
pended to 5 ×
 106 cells /ml in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen, CA) and subse-
quently stimulated with 10 μ
g/ml of zDIII protein, T cell mitogen ConA (5 μ
g/ml, MilliporeSigma, MA) (positive 
control), and RPMI 1640 medium (negative control), respectively. The supernatant of splenocyte cultures was 
collected 48 hr after stimulation to determine IFN-γ
 production by using ELISA MAX (Deluxe Set) mouse ELISA 
kits (BioLegend, CA) as instructed by the manufacturer’s protocol. Experiments were performed in triplicate and 
repeated at least three times independently.
Statistical analyses. 
GraphPad Prism software version 7.0 (GraphPad, CA) was used to perform the anal-
ysis of biochemical and immunological data. Non-linear regression analysis using a one-site binding model was 
used to determine the Kd of zDIII binding to ZV54. Comparisons of zDIII-specific IgG titers, cytokine con-
centrations, and neutralization potency between groups or between samples collected at various time points 
were performed by two-way ANOVA. Comparisons of HBcAg-zDIII expression levels between various days 
post agroinfiltration were performed with unpaired t-test. A p value of <0.05 indicated statistically significant 
differences.
