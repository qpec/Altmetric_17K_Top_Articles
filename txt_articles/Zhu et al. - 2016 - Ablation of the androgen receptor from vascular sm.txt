Vascular calcification powerfully predicts mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular disease. Men 
have a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, compared to women of a similar age. These gender 
disparities suggest an influence of sex hormones. Testosterone is the primary and most well-recognised 
androgen in men. Therefore, we addressed the hypothesis that exogenous androgen treatment induces 
vascular calcification. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed expression of androgen receptor (AR)  
in the calcified media of human femoral artery tissue and calcified human valves. Furthermore,  
in vitro studies revealed increased phosphate (Pi)-induced mouse vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) 
calcification following either testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment for 9 days. 
Testosterone and DHT treatment increased tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (Alpl) mRNA 
expression. Testosterone-induced calcification was blunted in VSMC-specific AR-ablated (SM-ARKO) 
VSMCs compared to WT. Consistent with these data, SM-ARKO VSMCs showed a reduction in Osterix 
mRNA expression. However, intriguingly, a counter-intuitive increase in Alpl was observed. These 
novel data demonstrate that androgens play a role in inducing vascular calcification through the AR. 
Androgen signalling may represent a novel potential therapeutic target for clinical intervention.
Being male is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease1, suggesting that androgens may nega-
tively impact the cardiovascular system. However, recent studies have suggested that testosterone may in fact exert 
protective effects on the cardiovascular system, as low plasma testosterone levels are associated with advanced 
atherosclerosis and independently related to cardiovascular disease and mortality2–6. Understanding this appar-
ent discrepancy is of paramount importance, given the dramatic increase in the use of Androgen Replacement 
Therapy (ART) in men over the last decade7,8. Furthermore, the continued abuse of anabolic androgens in 
sport9 induces long term adverse medical effects including cardiovascular toxicity along with manic behavioural 
symptoms10.
Testosterone is the primary androgen in men. The biological actions of testosterone, and particularly of non-
aromatizable dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are predominantly mediated by the androgen receptor (AR)11. The AR 
modulates transcription by binding to androgen-response elements (AREs) in the promoter and enhancer regions 
of target genes in the nucleus12. The AR is expressed throughout the arterial wall13,14 and has been reported to 
play a notable role in vascular disease15,16. Additionally, testosterone can be converted to estradiol by aromatase

signalling pathways may further refine the cellular effects of testosterone12,18.
Vascular calcification is a life-threatening complication of cardiovascular disease, affecting tissues including 
arteries, heart valves and cardiac muscle19–22. Whilst the mechanisms underpinning the pathogenesis of calcified 
aortic valve disease (CAVD) are still unclear, it has been shown to share many features with the predominantly 
studied arterial calcification22. Both CAVD and arterial calcification are recognised as active, tightly regulated pro-
cesses, sharing many similarities with physiological bone formation23 and involves the deposition of hydroxyapa-
tite crystals in arteries. Indeed VSMCs, the predominant cell type involved in vascular calcification, can undergo 
transdifferentiation to a chondrocytic, osteoblastic and osteocytic phenotype in a calcified environment24,25. 
Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that phosphate (Pi) accelerates this phenotypic trans-differentiation, evi-
dent in the loss of characteristic smooth muscle markers and the development of osteoblastic features, such as 
the expression of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), sodium-dependent phosphate co-transporter 
(PiT-1), osteocalcin and osteopontin, and osteocyte markers including sclerostin and podoplanin (Pdpn/E11)25,26. 
Vascular calcification also involves the reciprocal loss of recognised calcification suppressors, such as inorganic 
pyrophosphate (PPi), matrix Gla protein (MGP) and fetuin A27,28.
The prevalence of vascular calcification is sexually dimorphic, showing a relative increase in men com-
pared to women, which suggests possible hormonal influence29. Androgens have been reported to play a major 
regulatory role in bone formation, having significant effects on both osteoblast and osteoclast function30. The 
pro-calcificatory effects of androgens on established atherosclerotic lesions have recently been demonstrated in 
the Apolipoprotein E-null mouse model31. However, subsequent in vitro studies have suggested an inhibitory 
effect of testosterone on vascular calcification32. Given these inconsistent findings, there is a clear need for addi-
tional studies to firmly establish the role of androgens in vascular calcification. We have therefore undertaken 
analysis of clinical tissues in conjunction with in vitro calcification studies in C57BL/6 and SM-ARKO mice to 
address the hypothesis that testosterone induces vascular calcification through stimulation of AR.
Results
Expression of AR in human calcified cardiovascular tissue. 
To investigate the role of the AR in vas-
cular calcification, a critical and advanced phenotype of atherosclerosis, localisation studies were undertaken. 
Calcification of human femoral artery and aortic valve tissues was confirmed by alizarin red and von kossa stain-
ing (Fig. 1a I-IV,c I-IV). Immunohistochemistry established AR expression in calcified areas of human femoral

artery and arterial valve tissues (Fig. 1b I-II,d I-II). Additionally, higher expression of AR was observed in calci-
fied human aortic valve compared to control valve tissue (Fig. 1d I-II). These data are the first to show that AR is 
expressed alongside calcification in human calcified cardiovascular tissue.
Isolated VSMCs were positively stained with alpha smooth muscle actin (SMA) antibody (Fig. 1e, red). AR 
expression was confirmed in cultured murine VSMCs (the predominant cell type responsible for blood vessel 
calcification) by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1e, green), and was shown to increase following incubation 
with testosterone (100 nM) (Fig. 1e, green) for 48 hrs. Additionally, AR is expressed in the nucleus of VSMCs, as 
evidenced by DAPI counterstaining (Fig. 1e, blue, white arrow). Increased expression of AR following treatment 
with testosterone was also confirmed by western blotting (Fig. 1f,g). RT-PCR analysis revealed aromatase was 
expressed by mouse ovary and testis, but not in VSMCs (Fig. 1h).
Androgens induce high Pi-dependent VSMC calcification. 
To investigate the role of the AR in 
VSMCs, we examined the effects of androgens on VSMC calcification. Initial studies examined whether andro-
gens directly regulate the osteogenic differentiation and calcification of VSMCs. Since arterial calcification is 
highly correlated with elevated serum Pi levels, VSMCs were cultured in growth medium containing high Pi 
(3 mM) as previously described33,34. Cells were treated with 1–100 nM testosterone or DHT in the presence or 
absence of high Pi medium for up to 9 days. A minimum concentration of 10 nM testosterone treatment signifi-
cantly increased calcium deposition of VSMCs at 9 days, as evaluated by HCl leaching (1.8 fold, P < 
 0.01, Fig. 2a). 
A minimum concentration of 100 nM DHT treatment significantly increased calcium deposition in VSMCs at 
9 days (1.6 fold, P < 
 0.05, Fig. 2b). Testosterone and DHT (100 nM) induced a significant increase in the mRNA 
expression of Alpl a key mediator of mineralisation (1.14 fold, P < 
 0.01) (Fig. 2c). No change in the mRNA expres-
sion of the osteogenic marker Osterix or the mineralisation inhibitor Mgp was observed (Fig. 2d,e).
Androgens induce calcification through the AR. 
To examine whether testosterone-stimulated VSMC 
calcification is mediated through the AR, further studies were undertaken using cells derived from VSMC-specific 
AR-ablated (SM-ARKO) mice. Protein expression studies confirmed AR ablation in the VSMCs (Fig. 3a). 
Furthermore, testosterone exposure notably up-regulated AR protein expression in WT VSMCs, whereas AR 
expression remained absent in comparably-treated SM-ARKO cells (Fig. 3a). Additional studies revealed a 
marked reduction in Esr2 mRNA expression in SM-ARKO mice versus WT controls (0.4 fold; P < 
 0.05; Fig. 3b), 
whereas Esr1 expression remained unaltered (Fig. 3c). Consistent with our earlier observations (Fig. 2a), 100 nM 
testosterone significantly increased VSMC calcification in WT cells. However, testosterone-induced calcification 
was blunted in SM-ARKO cells (0.52 fold; P < 
 0.05; Fig. 3d). Consistent with these data, SM-ARKO VSMCs 
showed a significant reduction in Osterix mRNA expression (0.85 fold; P < 
 0.001; Fig. 4a). However, intriguingly, 
a counter-intuitive increase in Alpl was observed (3.3 fold; Fig. 4b, P < 
 0.001), with a concomitant decrease in the 
mineralisation inhibitor Mgp (0.5 fold; Fig. 4c, P < 
 0.001).
Testosterone has no effect on apoptosis of VSMCs. 
Apoptosis plays an important role in vascular 
calcification, we therefore examined the effect of testosterone treatment on VSMC apoptosis. Alamar blue assay 
showed no effect of either testosterone or DHT on cell viability (Fig. 5a). DAPI staining revealed no effect of either 
testosterone or DHT on nuclei apoptosis (Fig. 5b).
Discussion
Whilst testosterone deficiency has been linked with cardiovascular disease in men1, the effects of ART on vascular 
health are currently highly controversial7,8. Given the increasing pharmacological use of androgens in society, a 
more complete understanding of the cardiovascular safety of exogenous androgens is essential. This investigation 
addressed the hypothesis that androgen-induced stimulation of the AR induces arterial calcification. Our work 
offers new insight into the role of androgens in disease and provides direct evidence to suggest that testosterone 
contributes to the pathological process of vascular calcification.
Our in vitro investigations revealed that exogenous testosterone and DHT treatment both had striking effects 
on the induction of VSMC calcification. A concomitant increase in expression of Alpl, a recognised regulator 
of osteoblastic differentiation and matrix mineralisation of VSMCs was observed. Indeed, there is a substantial 
body of evidence linking TNAP elevation with vascular calcification. TNAP upregulation has been observed in 
calcified coronary atherosclerotic plaques35, as well as in medial vascular calcification associated with diabetes36, 
in patients undergoing dialysis37,38 and has been proposed as a cause of the vessel calcification seen in uremia39. 
Consistent with these findings, an association between long-term anabolic steroid abuse in men and early vas-
cular calcification has been previously reported40. Similarly, in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, elevated 
endogenous androgen levels are associated with increased vascular calcification41 and high dose testosterone 
administration in post-menopausal women has been associated with increased atherosclerosis as measured by 
detection of calcified deposits42. In addition, recent animal studies have employed the Apolipoprotein E mouse 
model to directly link testosterone and calcification in the vasculature31. However, in contrast to these data, a 
recent in vitro study has reported inhibitory effects of androgens on VSMC calcification32. This discrepancy may 
reflect key differences in the species, passage status and culture conditions of the cells investigated.
Androgens act mainly through transcriptional control of target genes mediated by AR11. In the present study 
we confirmed that AR is expressed in VSMCs, and identified for the first time the presence of AR expression in 
calcified human femoral artery and aortic valve tissue. These data are consistent with previous studies showing 
expression of AR in smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells in arteries14,43. Further studies are required to com-
prehensively establish AR expression levels throughout the different layers of arterial blood vessels. The ability 
of DHT to replicate the effects of testosterone, together with our data revealing a lack of aromatase expression, 
suggests that the pro-calcificatory androgenic effects are mediated directly through AR. Consistent with this

hypothesis, our in vitro studies demonstrated that AR is up-regulated in VSMCs by androgen treatment. This is 
in agreement with reports of increased local AR expression in the innominate artery in response to testosterone 
and DHT-induced calcification in the ApoE mouse model31. However, in a recent clinical analysis, no association 
between coronary artery calcification in men and AR expression was observed13. Potentially the exclusion of 
patients with existing coronary artery disease may have resulted in an underestimation of any association between 
AR expression and calcification in this study.

The utilisation of a novel vascular selective ARKO mouse model was central to this investigation. The employ-
ment of a cell-specific mouse line with AR deleted from VSMCs44 emphatically highlights, for the first time, a 
functional role for AR in androgen-induced vascular calcification. Reduced Osterix expression was observed 
in SM-ARKO VSMCs, suggesting androgen receptor may regulate osteogenic differentiation of VSMCs. 
Unexpectedly, altered expression of the calcification regulator Mgp and Alpl was also noted in SM-ARKO cells. 
Further studies are required to investigate their roles in AR-mediated calcification.
This study reveals AR expression in diseased vascular tissue and highlights a potential link between pharmacolog-
ical androgen use and vascular calcification. We note that this is achieved in a small sample, and these data need to be 
extended with further samples in future investigations. However, the clear demonstration that androgens directly act 
through the AR to mediate pro-calcificatory effects in VSMCs may have important health ramifications for patients 
with elevated AR expression in their vascular tissues and for the use of ART. These data also have strong implications 
for the role of androgens in aortic valve calcification, which independently predicts mortality in aortic stenosis45,46.
Materials and Methods
Human tissues. 
Arterial samples were obtained with appropriate ethical approval from a patient undergo-
ing amputation for critical limb ischaemia (Ethics Number: 13/ES/0126). Research ethics committee approval 
(National Health Service West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee: 12/WS/0227) and the written and 
informed consent of all participants were obtained. The sample was from an amputated leg from a man who had 
unsalvagable critical limb ischaemia secondary to in situ thrombosis of typical atherosclerotic femoro-popliteal 
peripheral arterial disease. He was an ex-smoker with no history of any endocrine disorder (including diabetes) 
and had an entirely normal masculine phenotype. He was on no hormonal treatment but was receiving standard 
therapy for atherosclerosis, namely aspirin and a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin). He had normal renal 
function and so the aetiology of the calcification in his femoral artery was associated with atherosclerosis. Serum 
testosterone levels were not measured. Human valve tissues were obtained with appropriate ethical approval from 
patients undergoing valve replacement surgery (Ethics No: 13/ES/0126). The control valve was from a 79 year old 
woman with aortic incompetence and generalised aortic dilatation with ascending aorta involvement. There was

operation, and carefully preserved the integrity of the valve architecture. An informed consent was given for the 
use of the human tissue and this study was performed in conformation with the declaration of Helsinki.
Materials. 
The AR antibody (Catalog: SC-816-G) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Paso Robles, US). 
Testosterone and DHT were obtained from Sigma (Poole, UK). The SMA antibody (Catalog: A2547) was from 
sigma. DAPI, Alexa Fluor@488 donkey-anti goat antibody (Catalog: A-11055) and Alexa Fluor@594 goat-anti 
mouse antibody (Catalog: A-11005) were from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK).
Mice. 
Mice with selective ablation of AR from VSMCs (SM-ARKO) were generated and genotyped as previ-
ously described14. All animal experiments were performed under UK Home Office licensed approval in accord-
ance with Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and were maintained in accordance with Home 
Office guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. C57BL/6 mice were supplied by Charles River 
Laboratories (Harlow, Essex, UK).
Isolation of primary murine VSMCs. 
Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Primary murine 
VSMCs were isolated as previously described25,33,34. After removal of adventitia, the aorta was cut open to expose the 
endothelial layer under a dissection microscope. Tissues from eight animals were pooled and incubated with 1 mg 
ml−1 trypsin (Invitrogen) for 10 min in order to remove any remaining adventitia and endothelium. After a further 
overnight incubation at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2 in α 
-MEM medium (Invitrogen) 
supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Invitrogen) and 1% gentamicin (Invitrogen), tissues were digested 
with 425 U/ml collagenase type II (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, USA) for 5 hrs. Medial 
cells were released and cell suspensions were centrifuged at 2000 g for 5 min. The cell pellet was washed and resus-
pended in the above mentioned culture medium. Isolated VSMCs were cultured with growth medium for two 
passages in T25 tissue culture flasks (Greiner Bio-one, GmbH, Frickenhausen, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany) 
coated with 0.25 μg/cm2 laminin (Sigma) to promote maintenance of the contractile differentiation state47.
Induction of calcification. 
Primary VSMCs were seeded in growth medium at a density of 1.5 × 
 104/cm2 
in multi-well plates. Calcification was induced as previously described25,33,34. In brief, cells were grown to conflu-
ence (day 0) and switched to calcification medium, which was prepared by adding 1 M inorganic phosphate (Pi) 
(a mixture of NaH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) (Sigma), to reach a final concentration of 3 mM Pi. VSMCs were 
incubated for up to 9 days in 95% air/ 5% CO2 and the medium was changed every third/fourth day. Testosterone 
(1–100 nM) or DHT (1–100 nM) were added at day 0, according to previous publications14,32.
Determination of calcification. 
Calcium deposition was quantified as previously described34,48,49. Briefly, 
cells were rinsed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and decalcified with 0.6 N HCl at room temperature 
for 24 hrs. Free calcium was determined colorimetrically by a stable interaction with phenolsulphonethalein using 
a commercially available kit (Randox Laboratories Ltd., County Antrim, UK) and corrected for total protein con-
centration (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd, Hemel Hempstead, UK).
Analysis of gene expression. 
RNA was extracted using RNeasy total RNA (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK), 
 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed and specific cDNAs were 
semi-quantified by end point PCR or quantified by real-time PCR using the SYBR green detection method as 
previously reported33,34,48 Primers were obtained from Eurofins MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany), Qiagen, 
Ambion (Cambridge UK) and Primer Design (Southampton, UK), with available sequences provided in the 
online Data Supplement (Suppl. Table S1).
Alamar blue staining. 
VSMCs were grown on 96-well plates at a density of 5,000 cells/ well. Alamar blue 
assay was performed as previously described49. Alamar blue reagent (Invitrogen) (10 μl/100 μl medium) was 
added to culture medium for the final 4 hrs of culture at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Optical density absorbance was ana-
lysed at wavelengths of 570 nm and 620 nm using a spectrophotometer (Multiskan Ascent; Thermo Electron 
Corporation,Vantaa, Finland).
Apoptosis. 
Apoptotic VSMCs were determined by manually counting pyknotic nuclei after staining with 
DAPI (Invitrogen) as previously described50.
Fluorescent immunocytochemical staining. 
VSMCs were seeded on glass coverslips in 12-well plates 
at a density of 50, 000 cells/well. Following confluence, VSMCs were serum-restricted for 24 hrs and treated with 
contro or 100 nM testosterone for 48 hrs. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and washed with PBS. The 
fixed cells were permeabilised with 0.3% Triton-X 100 (Sigma) and incubated with anti-AR antibody (Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-SMA (Sigma) overnight at 4o C. After washing, cells were incubated with Alexa 
Fluor@488 donkey-anti goat antibody and Alexa Fluor@594 goat-anti mouse antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 hr in 
the dark. Glass coverslips were mounted onto slides with Prolong® 
Gold Anti-Fade Reagent contained DAPI 
(Invitrogen). Fluorescence signal was detected under a Leica fluorescence microscope (Milton Keynes, UK).
Western analysis. 
VSMCs were treated with 100 nM testosterone for 48 hrs. Cells were lysed in PhosphoSafe 
extraction buffer (Merck Biosciences Ltd, Nottingham, UK) containing “Complete” protease inhibitor cocktail 
(Roche, East Sussex, UK) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Western blotting was performed as previously 
described23,32,33. Nitrocellulose membranes were probed overnight at 4 °C with anti-AR antibody (Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology), washed in TBST and incubated with anti-goat IgG-peroxidase respectively (DAKO, Glostrup,

Denmark) for 1 hr (1:1000 dilution in 5% milk). The immune complexes were visualised using enhanced chemi-
luminescence (ECL) (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). Membranes were then washed in ‘stripping buffer’ 
(Pierce, Rockford, Il, USA) and re-probed for 1 hr for β 
-actin expression (1:5000 dilution in 5% milk; anti β 
-actin 
clone AC15; Sigma-Aldrich).
Histology and immunohistochemistry. 
Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) for 
24 hrs before being dehydrated and embedded in paraffin wax and sectioning at 4 μm using standard procedures. 
Sections were de-waxed in xylene and stained with Von Kossa and alizarin red (Sigma) to visualise phosphate 
and calcium deposition, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the VECTASTAIN ABC Kit 
(Goat IgG) (Vector Labs, Peterborough, UK) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Sections were de-waxed in 
xylene and de-masked with citric acid based antigen unmasking solution (Vector Labs). Endogenous peroxidase 
and non-specific antibody binding were blocked before overnight incubation at 4 
oC with 2 μg IgG/ml anti-AR 
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The sections were then washed in PBS, incubated with diluted biotinylated 
secondary antibody (1:200 dilution) for 30 min. After washing in PBS for 5 min, the sections were incubated for 
30 min with VECTASTAIN® 
 ABC Reagent (Vector Labs). The sections were then incubated with DAB substrate 
reagent (0.06% DAB, 0.1% H2O2 in PBS) until the desired stain intensity developed. The sections were finally 
dehydrated, counterstained with haematoxylin and eosin and mounted in DePeX. Control sections were incu-
bated with non-immune goat IgG (2 μg IgG/ml) in place of the primary AR antibody.
Statistical analysis. 
General Linear Model analysis and the Students t-test were used to assess the data. All 
data are expressed as the mean +
