 Summary
The use of cell salvage is recommended when it can be expected to reduce the likelihood of allogeneic
(donor) red cell transfusion and/or severe postoperative anaemia. We support and encourage a continued
increase in the appropriate use of peri-operative cell salvage and we recommend that it should be avail-
able for immediate use 24 h a day in any hospital undertaking surgery where blood loss is a recognised
potential complication (other than minor/day case procedures).
Recommendations
1
The use of cell salvage is recommended when it can
be expected to reduce the likelihood of allogeneic
(donor) red cell transfusion and/or severe postoperative
anaemia.
2
We recommend that cell salvage equipment and staff
trained to operate it be immediately available 24 h a
day in hospitals undertaking surgery where blood loss
is a recognised complication.
3
Collection of blood for potential cell salvage (‘collect
only’ mode) should be considered for surgical proce-
dures where blood loss may exceed 500 ml (or
> 10% of calculated total blood volume) in adult
patients, or > 8 ml.kg�1 (> 10% of calculated total
blood volume) in children weighing > 10 kg.
4
Each hospital should have both a nominated clinical
lead and a coordinator for cell salvage, who oversee a
competence-based training programme for all involved
staff, along with ongoing data collection and audit.
5
When the use of cell salvage is proposed in surgery
for malignancy or infection, an explanation should be
given to the patient of the potential risks and benefits
and specific consent should be obtained.
6
The use of leucodepletion filters should be consid-
ered during re-infusion of salvaged blood in cancer
surgery and when blood is salvaged from an infected
surgical field. There is mixed evidence of the benefit
of leucocyte depletion filters in obstetrics.
7
Current evidence does not support the routine use of
cell salvage during caesarean section. Cell salvage
should be considered in the ‘collect only’ mode
in women undergoing caesarean section who are
anaemic before surgery, in women anticipated to
be at high risk of haemorrhage or if unanticipated
bleeding develops during surgery.
What other guideline statements are
available on this topic?
These guidelines update previous Association of Anaes-
thetists guidelines on intra-operative cell salvage pub-
lished in 2009 [1]. The National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines for intra-
operative cell salvage in obstetrics in 2005 [2] and in
urology in 2008 [3]. The UK Cell Salvage Action Group
has published guidance and other resources [4]. In
Australia, the National Blood Authority has published
relevant guidance [5]. Most recently, the NICE transfusion
guidelines refer to cell salvage [6].
Why were these guidelines
developed?
These guidelines were developed to inform, support and
encourage the appropriate increased use of cell salvage
as part of a blood conservation (Patient Blood Manage-
ment) programme.
How and why does this statement
differ from existing guidelines?
This guideline recommends wider use of cell salvage,
and recommends that cell salvage should be universally
available in hospitals performing major surgery.
Introduction
Our previous guideline on this topic was published in
2009, when cell salvage (CS) was relatively underused
and devices were only just being introduced into many
hospitals [1]. Since then, there has been rapid expansion
in its availability and use. The aim of this guideline is
to provide a practical series of recommendations to
facilitate widespread use.
Although potentially life-saving, allogeneic (donor)
blood is a precious resource with limited supply [7]. It is
relatively expensive, and poses potential risks to the
patient [8]. There has been much work to try to encour-
age
appropriate
transfusion
practice
and
renewed
interest in alternatives to allogeneic transfusion. In 2012,
the National Blood Transfusion Committee, NHS Blood
and Transplant and the Department of Health, launched
the
Patient
Blood
Management
(PBM)
initiative
in
England and North Wales. Patient Blood Management is
an evidence-based multidisciplinary approach to the care
of patients requiring transfusion, which includes: pre-

 operative haemoglobin optimisation; bloodless surgery;
the use of antifibrinolytics; blood conservation tech-
niques; and evidence-based transfusion triggers, which, if
implemented, should reduce the need for allogeneic
transfusion [9].
During the peri-operative care of a patient, the
anaesthetist has a fundamental role in advocating PBM
strategies. Cell salvage is a key part of PBM and is a
relatively
simple
and
effective
blood
conservation
technique that reduces the requirement for and amount
of allogeneic blood transfusion and maintains postoper-
ative
haemoglobin
concentration.
Cell
salvage
is
a
method of autologous blood transfusion. It involves the
collection of shed blood during and immediately after
surgery, which is re-infused back to the same patient.
Intra-operative CS usually involves the use of a device
which processes shed blood; however, postoperatively,
unwashed filtered blood can be re-infused under certain
circumstances.
Currently, NICE recommends that cell salvage is con-
sidered in operations where very high-volume blood loss
is expected, such as cardiac, major (open) vascular,
complex urology, obstetric and orthopaedic surgery [6].
The Association of Anaesthetists has defined significant
blood loss as > 500 ml in adults [10]. A recent survey by
the UK Cell Salvage Action Group suggests that CS is
being used across several specialties, but that some units
still face significant barriers, such as lack of staffing, training
and funding [11]. Obstetric practice was the specialty where
the increased use of CS was most apparent, with other
specialties’ usage static between 2010 and 2014.
It is our aim to support and encourage a continued
increase in the appropriate use of peri-operative CS and
we recommend that it should be available for immediate
use 24 h a day in any hospital undertaking surgery (other
than minor/day case procedures). The Working Party
acknowledges
that
proper implementation
will require
additional resources for which clinical managers should
work towards over time.
Principles and practice of intra-
operative cell salvage
Cell salvage begins with the collection of shed blood
from the surgical field. The blood is mixed with an
anticoagulant, either heparinised saline or acid-citrate
dextrose, as it is aspirated using a low-pressure suction
into a collection reservoir, where it passes through a
filter. Separation of red cells from whole anticoagulated
blood occurs through centrifugation. The red cells are
washed using intravenous saline 0.9% and then pumped
into a bag for re-infusion to the patient. There are a
variety of CS systems available. All the systems produce
a comparable end-product, that is, the patient’s own red
cells suspended in saline.
Cell salvage should be used alongside other PBM
measures. It is appropriate to use cell salvage when it can
be expected to reduce the likelihood of allogeneic
(donor) red cell transfusion and/or severe postoperative
anaemia. Cell salvage should be considered for blood col-
lection during every surgical procedure when blood loss
may exceed 500 ml in adult patients. National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence recommends CS should not
be routinely used without also giving tranexamic acid [6].
It should also be considered if: the patient is at an
increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy or other
risk factors; the patient is anaemic and surgery is urgent
and there is no time for active management of anaemia
before surgery [9]; or the patient has a religious or other
objection to receiving an allogeneic transfusion. If there is
doubt about expected blood loss, then we recommend
that the most cost effective measure is to set up only the
suction and anticoagulation tubing and reservoir of the
CS device (so-called ‘collect only’). The blood processing
system is then set up during surgery only if enough blood
has been collected for processing to be worthwhile,
usually more than 500 ml [4].
Cell salvage is commonly used during the following
types of surgery: cardiac; major vascular; major hepatobil-
iary; major spinal surgery; arthroplasty surgery, particularly
revision hip replacement; major urological surgery; surgery
for thoracic, abdominal and pelvic trauma; and obstetric
procedures and major obstetric haemorrhage [12].
There
are
no
absolute
contraindications
to
CS;
however, potential contamination of the aspirated blood
with bowel contents, infection or tumour cells should be
regarded as a relative contraindication, depending on
the likelihood/degree of contamination. In these situa-
tions, an assessment of the risks and benefits of CS
should occur [13]. Patient refusal is unusual, and most
Jehovah’s Witness patients will accept CS – this should
be
discussed
and
documented
before
surgery.
The
equipment can usually be set up as for non-Jehovah’s
Witness patients, that is, without a continuous connection
from the patient to the CS system and back to the
patient. A history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
is a contraindication to the use of a heparin-containing
anticoagulant solution with CS. An anticoagulant solution
containing acid-citrate dextrose may be used instead.
Where there is temporary contamination of the surgical
field with solutions that may cause red cell lysis, or drugs

 or substances that should not be given intravenously,
then CS should be discontinued and the standard operat-
ing room suction system used instead. In most cases, CS
may be resumed later following irrigation of the surgical
field with saline.
The Working Party suggests that detailed information
about CS is given to patients before surgery whenever
the use of CS is planned or likely, and that patients are
offered an opportunity to discuss the potential advan-
tages and disadvantages of CS with an appropriate
clinician.
Organisation of service and education
of staff
Cell salvage should be integral to and embedded within
surgical and peri-operative practice, and we recommend
that CS equipment and staff trained to operate it be
immediately available 24 h a day in hospitals undertaking
surgery where blood loss is a recognised complication.
There should be a named clinical lead and nomi-
nated CS coordinator (e.g. theatre practitioner registered
nurse,
operating
department
practitioner/anaesthetic
assistant,
perfusionist)
within
the
operating
theatre
department who are responsible for ensuring overall
management and facilitation of the hospital CS service.
Every surgical and obstetric unit should have a local
guideline/protocol and standard operating procedure in
place. These should specify: staff training; patient selec-
tion; patient information; prescribing requirements; stan-
dards of labelling for the re-infusion bag; checks before
transfusion; documentation; adverse incident reporting;
quality assurance; and audit, as detailed below. National
Occupational Standards should be referred to [14]. These
are broad and generic standards that apply to all person-
nel involved in CS regardless of professional background.
An adequate number of staff should be trained and skilled
in the use of CS to allow service continuity throughout the
24-h period.
Although it is possible to have dedicated CS opera-
tors, it is more common for theatre staff or a perfusionist
to undertake this as part of their role. Staff involved in
CS must be trained and assessed as competent in the
set-up and use of equipment. In some hospitals, clinical
support workers have been trained to set up CS equip-
ment, but not trained in its use. Records of training and
assessment should be collated and maintained by the
service coordinator, and individuals should be encour-
aged to include them in their professional portfolios,
which must be kept within the department and as part of
individual records. Local policy should define which roles
within the CS team require what training and how
frequently retraining is required, in line with established
guidance [4].
The individual practitioner is responsible for working
within their professional boundaries and sphere of com-
petence [15]; CS operators should maintain a clinical log
of cases. In hospitals where there is a low level of CS
activity, it is the responsibility of the individual and their
manager to identify additional and appropriate opportu-
nities to maintain competence and clinical currency. This
may be achieved through simulation or collaborative
working with other organisations. Additionally, mainte-
nance
of
training
and
competence
records
by
the
employing organisation is fundamental to safe working
practices.
In addition to the theoretical knowledge, it is essen-
tial that practical, skills-based training is undertaken to
familiarise individuals with equipment and procedures for
use [4, 16], followed by assessment of competence.
Training specific to equipment may be provided by the
manufacturers
or
designated
local
trainers.
However,
manufacturers are not able to assess for competence in
clinical practice – this remains the responsibility of the
employing organisation.
Whenever CS is used, this should be accurately clini-
cally coded to meet the approved NHS Fundamental
Information Standard (SNOMED-CT code 233568002).
This will enable appropriate reimbursement of the service
and improve data collection and audit [17]. The Working
Party recommends that relevant data should be continu-
ously collected and audited regularly. Regarding quality
assurance,
we
suggest
the
following
are
regularly
reviewed: maintenance contracts and regular servicing of
the machines; interval sampling of blood produced by
CS for laboratory testing of haemoglobin concentration;
and log of authorised personnel including records of
training and assessment [4].
The Working Party suggests that the World Health
Organization (WHO) checklist should include the men-
tion of CS when required when discussing haemor-
rhage,
and
that
this
should
be
reflected
in
local
policies. The use of CS and infusion of salvage red cells
in the operating theatre should be clearly documented,
and any red cells for re-infusion outside the operating
theatre should be authorised by the responsible clini-
cian. A minimal data set for labelling the re-infusion
bag and collection reservoir must include the patient’s
full name, date of birth, unique identification number,
expiry date and time of the salvaged blood (on the re-
infusion bag) [4].

 Technical aspects
The cell salvage system should be used according to the
manufacturers’ instructions and should be routinely run in
automatic mode if available. There are several different
suction devices [18] and different machines [19] on the
market, and staff should be appropriately trained in the
equipment used in their institution. Within an institution, it
is preferable to use only one type of CS machine to
maximise familiarity and experience. To reduce haemo-
lysis, the vacuum pressure should always be set as low as
practicable.
Typical
values
are
between
�100
and
�150 mmHg, and excess pressures should be avoided to
minimise red cell lysis [4]. In the event of rapid blood loss,
the vacuum level can be temporarily raised to clear the
surgical field and then reduced to a lower level for lower
flows.
The re-infusion of salvaged blood should be com-
pleted
within
the manufacturers’ recommended
time
frame; this is usually 4 h after the completion of process-
ing for intra-operative cell salvage and 6 h after the start
of collection for postoperative cell salvage. In addition,
the bag of processed blood should not be placed in a
blood fridge and should be kept beside the patient at all
times. If heparinised saline is used as the anticoagulant
solution, care must be taken to add the correct volume
and concentration of heparin and label the bag clearly
so that it is not accidently given intravenously. If there is
rapid blood loss and the CS system is operated in
manual or emergency mode, or in the case of operator
error, excessive heparin may be given back to the patient
in the re-infused blood, resulting in anticoagulation and
increased bleeding. In this case, the activated clotting
time
(ACT)
or
activated
partial
thromboplastin
time
(APTT) should be checked, and if elevated (e.g. ACT
> 125 s), protamine may be given. An alternative to hep-
arinised saline is acid-citrate dextrose, which is available
in pre-prepared bags. In case of rapid blood loss or
operator error, significant quantities of citrate may be re-
infused along with the salvaged blood and, as with the
citrate present in allogeneic blood components, this may
cause hypocalcaemia requiring calcium administration.
When
re-infusing
processed
red
cells,
bed-side
checks before transfusion should be performed in the
same manner as for allogeneic blood. A standard blood
administration set with an in-line blood filter should be
used. Pressurising re-infusion bags presents a risk of air
embolism and is not recommended. All single-use equip-
ment should be disposed according to the local health
and safety policy. The machine should be cleaned in
accordance with the manufacturers’ guidance and local
infection-control policy.
There should be an audit log completed and kept in
the
department
attached
to
each
machine.
Serious
adverse events and reactions should be reported to the
clinical lead and the Hospital Transfusion Committee, and,
if appropriate, a report should be completed and sent to
Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT, http://www.shotuk.
org/) and /or the Medicines and Healthcare products
Regulatory Agency (MHRA, https://www.gov.uk/government/
organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-
agency), as appropriate.
Obstetrics
Obstetric haemorrhage is a significant cause of maternal
mortality and the most report showed an increase in
deaths – almost double the rate – from haemorrhage,
mainly attributable to abnormal placentation [20]; it also
remains a leading cause of maternal morbidity in the UK
[21]. National surveys show that CS is a resource that is
being used more frequently in UK obstetric units [22].
Re-infusion rates and cost effectiveness are variable and
directly associated with larger volumes of blood loss [23].
Despite the growing availability of equipment and safety
endorsements for its use, challenges remain in providing
CS in an obstetric surgical setting. Haemorrhage associ-
ated with emergency operative delivery is often not pre-
dictable, rapid and occurs out of hours.
The
SALVO
trial
(cell
salvage
during
caesarean
section: a randomised controlled trial) is the largest study
to date (n = 3054) examining the role of CS in caesarean
section [24]. SALVO did not find a significant difference
in donor transfusion rate in caesarean section or a cost
benefit argument for routinely setting up a complete col-
lection and retransfusion system. However, institutional
level costs are still dependent on case volume, expected
levels of blood loss per case and initial investment costs
[25]. Use of strategies such as swab washing to improve
collection rates should be considered to contribute to
the complex analysis of cost effectiveness locally [26].
Furthermore, although SALVO’s exploratory analysis in
cases of malplacentation did not demonstrate effective-
ness, the trial cannot be used to justify or refute the use
of CS in cases of anticipated torrential haemorrhage. As
in previous studies, there is evidence of fetomaternal
haemorrhage, which supports the concerns regarding
increased risk of haemolytic disease in future pregnan-
cies. The group recommends further research on the
long-term consequences of allo-immunisation to RhD and

 other red cell antigens following the use of CS and
emphasises the need for strict adherence to anti-D guide-
lines in units using CS.
Use of leucocyte depletion filters and the requirement
for separate suction for blood have now been questioned
by some advocates of the technology A double suction
technique – one waste sucker for amniotic fluid and
another sucker attached to the cell salvage device for suc-
tioning any blood lost – may reduce initial contamination,
although in-vitro evidence consistently demonstrates that
the cell salvage/filtration process can effectively remove
plasma phase elements of amniotic fluid whatever the
initial load [27]. Use of leucocyte depletion filters (LDF)
should be considered but these slow re-infusion rates and
evidence for their effectiveness in this setting is mixed
[28]. Because they are adhesion filters, blood cannot be
forced through them and they may become saturated
during use, requiring replacement, and have the potential
to cause bradykinin-mediated hypotension. The Working
Party decided not to recommend routine use of double
suction or LDFs in obstetric practice.
Therefore, the Working Party recommends that CS is
not used routinely for caesarean section based on the
current evidence, be it elective, urgent or emergency.
Cell salvage should be considered in ‘collect only’ mode
in patients who are anaemic before surgery or if there is
unanticipated ongoing bleeding during surgery. If a
decision is made to use it because a woman declines
autologous transfusion or significant blood loss is antici-
pated, the risk and benefits should be discussed with the
woman.
Cell salvage during cardiac and
vascular surgery
Cardiac surgery accounts for approximately 6% of all
blood transfused in England and Wales [28], due to fre-
quent major surgical blood loss exacerbated by coagu-
lopathy and impaired platelet function associated with
cardiopulmonary bypass. Cell salvage during
cardiac
surgery is widely accepted; a meta-analysis of 31 trials
showed that routine use reduced the transfusion of red
cells by 40% [29].
Blood lost before and after bypass, when the patient
is not heparinised, is wasted unless cell salvage is used.
However, during bypass, when the patient is heparinised,
cardiotomy suckers are used to collect any blood from
the surgical field, which is passed through a filter and
returned to the bypass reservoir and then the patient’s
circulation. There has been some research into the use of
CS during bypass, instead of the use of cardiotomy
suckers. However, the use of CS during bypass, compared
with direct suction into the cardiotomy reservoir, results
in depletion of clotting factors and platelets, and is
therefore not recommended.
After bypass, around 500–1000 ml of blood will be
left in the bypass circuit and reservoir. It is commonplace
to return this unprocessed blood to the patient, but there
is some evidence that processing this by separation and
washing of red cells using a cell salvage system, thereby
concentrating the red cells and increasing the haemat-
ocrit before re-infusion, may be beneficial in terms of
reduction
in
requirement
for
allogeneic
blood
[30].
However, centrifugation of residual bypass pump blood
is also effective in increasing the haematocrit before
re-infusion [31]. Other blood concentrating devices have
not been shown to be effective [32]. We recommend that
cell salvage, if already in progress, be used to concen-
trate residual bypass pump blood before re-infusion;
alternatively,
the
use
of
centrifugation
under
these
circumstances is reasonable [31].
Some centres in the UK routinely use cell salvage
throughout cardiac surgery. However, there is conflicting
evidence for cost effectiveness during lower-risk surgery
such as primary coronary bypass or single valve surgery
[33]. We recommend the use of cell salvage, at least in
‘collect only’ mode, for all cardiac surgery. If blood
collected is > 500 ml, this can be processed and returned
to the patient. Cell salvage is recommended whenever
cardiac surgery is performed without the use of bypass
(‘off-pump’).
The use of cell salvage during open aortic surgery
is also well established. It has been shown to be safe,
and a meta-analysis has shown that the use of cell
salvage may reduce the risk of red cell transfusion by
37% in patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic
aneurysm (AAA) repair [34]. A study in emergency AAA
surgery showed that up to three units of red cells may
be saved per patient and that hospital mortality was
reduced [35]. We recommend that cell salvage is used
routinely for all open aortic surgery, and considered for
all
vascular
surgery
where
> 500 ml
blood
loss
is
expected.
Orthopaedics and trauma
Data from 19 years and more than 2 million total joint
arthroplasties revealed that there was an increase in red
cell transfusion until 2011 and that this was associated
with an increase in morbidity [36]. In a meta-analysis of
RCTs that included hip and knee arthroplasties, intra-
operative CS significantly reduced red cell transfusion

 exposure rate and the volume of allogeneic red cells
transfused [37].
Intra-operative
CS
should
be
considered
in
all
patients undergoing orthopaedic or trauma surgery when
blood loss is expected to be > 500 ml. If bone cement is
used, then CS should not be used while cement is being
applied and can be resumed when the cement is fully
set. For revision surgery, when metalwork may be in situ,
such as previously instrumented spinal surgery, there is
evidence that standard 40 micron filters do not eliminate
the smallest fragments of titanium, so caution should be
exercised [38]. However, we still recommend that CS is
considered in such cases, with the proviso that standard
suction is used until the surgical field has been irrigated
and all metal fragments removed. Also, CS should not be
used while the surgical field is contaminated with antibi-
otics, iodine or topical clotting agents, but its use may be
resumed once these have been washed away.
Cell salvage is particularly useful in operations where
a tourniquet cannot be applied, such as hip arthroplasty
or spinal surgery. When tourniquets are used, for example,
in knee surgery, the CS equipment can be set up for use
once the tourniquet has been released and re-infusion can
take place in the postoperative period. Alternatively, blood
collected via drains postoperatively can be re-infused, with
or without processing.
A Cochrane review comparing CS with standard care
in patients undergoing abdominal or thoracic trauma
surgery
found
that
the
use
of
CS
resulted
in
the
transfusion of 4.7 (95%CI 1.3–8.1) fewer units of allogeneic
red cells [39]. It concluded that CS in this setting reduces
blood transfusion and is cost effective. Prospective data
for 30 patients [40] undergoing pelvic acetabular fracture
fixation found a mean blood loss of 1233 ml and an aver-
age of 388 ml retransfused through CS; only 47% of
patients required allogeneic transfusion. In a combat
hospital, a CS feasibility study concluded that CS was
most successful in patients with gunshot wounds and
cavity injuries compared with limb or blast injuries [41].
In a dedicated trauma/emergency operating theatre,
we recommend that a CS machine and staff trained to
operate it should be immediately available at all times.
Paediatrics
Complications of allogeneic blood transfusion in children
and infants may be more common than in adults [42].
Pre-operative autologous donation in children has both
practical and complex logistical problems that make it
costly and of uncertain benefit [43]. Cell salvage should
be used as part of a comprehensive Patient Blood
Management programme [44]. Cell salvage is used most
frequently in spinal surgery (larger children or adoles-
cents), during cardiac surgery [45], liver transplantation
and cranio-facial surgery [46]. Cell salvage may replace
or reduce the transfusion of allogeneic blood, depending
on the clinical circumstances.
The expected blood loss (EBL) to blood volume (BV)
ratio (EBL/BV) that might mandate the use of CS varies in
the paediatric literature from 10% to 40%, and this
reflects local practice and equipment availability. The
Working Party recommends that CS should be consid-
ered at least in ‘collect only’ mode when blood loss
> 8 ml.kg�1 (equivalent to approximately > 10% of total
blood volume) is anticipated and the child’s weight is
> 10 kg [47].
Some CS devices collect aliquots of blood in a bowl
that must be filled before washing to retrieve the blood,
and in many cases the volume retrieved is insufficient to
be processed. This can be obviated in different ways: the
volume lost can be drained into a receptacle in the
surgical drape that has been prepared with heparinised
saline and this can be drained and washed once a
certain volume has been shed; a smaller volume bowl
can be used; a partially filled bowl can be processed; or
a continuous auto-transfusion system (CATS
TM, Fresenius
Kabi, Runcorn, UK) can be used that is not dependent on
collecting intermittent, large aliquots of blood. Whether
there is a practical difference between these approaches
has been questioned [48].
The cost effectiveness of cell salvage in children has
been examined. Samnaliev et al. examined the costs and
benefits of cell salvage in 478 children undergoing
cardiac or orthopaedic surgery at Boston Children’s
Hospital, who qualified for CS according to local protocol
[49]. They concluded that CS was the most cost-effective
strategy, although half of the children in whom CS was
used also required transfusion of allogeneic blood. Golab
et al. suggested that although CS was safe and reduced
allogeneic transfusion, it was costly [45]. Cholette et al.
[50] did not critically examine cost. Differing disposable
and staff costs in different institutions may alter the cost
but the reduction in allogeneic transfusion is clear.
Postoperative cell salvage
Patients may continue to bleed postoperatively, and the
use
of
drains
to
prevent
accumulation
of
blood
is
commonplace after many surgical procedures. Blood col-
lected via drains can potentially be re-infused. Two types
of postoperative blood salvage systems are available.

 collection of blood from which the red cells are separated
by centrifugation and washed with saline in the same man-
ner as for intra-operative cell salvage. In unwashed/filtered
postoperative blood salvage, blood is collected and
re-infused through a filter without centrifugation or washing.
A Cochrane review analysed 29 trials on postopera-
tive cell salvage after cardiac and orthopaedic surgery
[12], and showed a 41% reduction in allogeneic red cell
transfusion (RR 0.59; 95%CI 0.48–0.73).
Re-infusion of recovered blood, with or without wash-
ing, after orthopaedic procedures is safe and economical
[51]. Unwashed postoperative blood salvage may be
used after orthopaedic surgery, particularly total knee
arthroplasty, and has been found to reduce exposure to
allogeneic red cell transfusion [6].
After cardiac surgery, blood collected via the chest
drains must be processed through a cell salvage system
before re-infusion due to accumulation of fat and other
contaminants
that
are
removed
by
the
cell
salvage
process. We recommend that (washed) CS be considered
in patients who bleed > 100 ml.h�1 in the first 6 h after
cardiac surgery, and whenever resternotomy is required
for haemorrhage [4, 5].
Cancer surgery
Despite theoretical concern, there is no absolute con-
traindication to CS in cancer surgery. Its use is controver-
sial because malignant cells are often present in the
operative field, can be found in salvaged blood and may,
theoretically,
metastasise
after
re-infusion.
Circulating
malignant cells are often present in cancer patients
undergoing surgery, regardless of CS use, and very few
of these cells are thought capable of causing metastases
[52]. The number of malignant cells in salvaged blood
can be reduced by the use of LDFs, with no apparent
adverse effect on the quality of the product [52]. The use
of LDFs has not been shown to be associated with either
bradykinin
or
leukotriene
generation
in
cell-salvaged
blood [53]. Cell salvage may reduce or eliminate expo-
sure to allogeneic blood, which has been associated with
immunosuppression and cancer recurrence [54]. One
major disadvantage of LDFs is that the rate of flow
through
them
is
considerably
slower,
and
therefore
clinicians may need to assess the benefit of quicker
transfusion without a LDF vs. its use.
In summary, despite theoretical risks and benefits,
there is no conclusive evidence that CS can induce metas-
tases or affect cancer prognosis [55]. The theoretical risk of
inducing metastatic spread (unproven) is offset by reduced
allogeneic transfusion and immunomodulation, which is
proven. As a result, many clinicians do offer cell salvage to
patients undergoing major cancer surgery. The Working
Party recommends that potential risks and benefits should
be discussed with patients before cancer surgery, and
specific consent obtained.
Infected and contaminated fields
There is no absolute contraindication to CS in this setting.
Its use is, however, controversial, because CS might
(theoretically)
worsen
sepsis
by
introducing
infective
agents and toxins recovered in the operative field. Con-
versely, CS reduces exposure to allogeneic blood, which
may increase the incidence of postoperative infection
through immunomodulation [56, 57]. Washing of col-
lected blood and the use of LDFs removes most bacteria,
but this effect is probably dependent on the level of con-
tamination [58]. There is no conclusive evidence that CS
worsens sepsis, prognosis or the risk of other specific
complications when used in contaminated fields, includ-
ing major trauma surgery.
We recommend that the use of cell salvage in cancer
surgery and infected fields should be considered on a case
by case basis. Whenever possible, patients in whom cell
savage is used should be counselled and asked whether
they consent to the procedure being used. Leucodepletion
filters should be used for blood re-infusion.
