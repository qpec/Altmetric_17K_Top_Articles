IMPORTANCE The age-based or “
one-size-fits-all”breast screening approach does not take
into account the individual variation in risk. Mammography screening reduces death from
breast cancer at the cost of overdiagnosis. Identifying risk-stratified screening strategies with
a more favorable ratio of overdiagnoses to breast cancer deaths prevented would improve
the quality of life of women and save resources.
OBJECTIVE To assess the benefit-to-harm ratio and the cost-effectiveness of risk-stratified
breast screening programs compared with a standard age-based screening program and no
screening.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION A life-table model was created of a hypothetical cohort of
364 500 women in the United Kingdom, aged 50 years, with follow-up to age 85 years, using
(1) findings of the Independent UK Panel on Breast Cancer Screening and (2) risk distribution
based on polygenic risk profile. The analysis was undertaken from the National Health Service
perspective.
INTERVENTIONS The modeled interventions were (1) no screening, (2) age-based screening
(mammography screening every 3 years from age 50 to 69 years), and (3) risk-stratified
screening (a proportion of women aged 50 years with a risk score greater than a threshold
risk were offered screening every 3 years until age 69 years) considering each percentile of
the risk distribution. All analyses took place between July 2016 and September 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Overdiagnoses, breast cancer deaths averted,
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, costs in British pounds, and net monetary benefit
(NMB). Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to assess uncertainty around parameter
estimates. Future costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per year.
RESULTS The risk-stratified analysis of this life-table model included a hypothetical cohort of
364 500 women followed up from age 50 to 85 years. As the risk threshold was lowered, the
incremental cost of the program increased linearly, compared with no screening, with no
additional QALYs gained below 35th percentile risk threshold. Of the 3 screening scenarios,
the risk-stratified scenario with risk threshold at the 70th percentile had the highest NMB, at
a willingness to pay of £20 000 (US $26 800) per QALY gained, with a 72% probability of
being cost-effective. Compared with age-based screening, risk-stratified screening at the
32nd percentile vs 70th percentile risk threshold would cost £20 066 (US $26 888) vs
£537 985 (US $720 900) less, would have 26.7% vs 71.4% fewer overdiagnoses, and would
avert 2.9% vs 9.6% fewer breast cancer deaths, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Not offering breast cancer screening to women at lower risk
could improve the cost-effectiveness of the screening program, reduce overdiagnosis, and
maintain the benefits of screening.

 T
he Breast Cancer Screening Programme in the United
Kingdom invites women in the general population
aged 50 to 69 years for 2-view digital mammography
every 3 years. However, the risk of developing breast
cancer varies among women.1 This age-based or the “one-
size-fits-all” screening approach does not take into account
the individual variation in risk. To date, several studies in
breast and prostate cancer have reported that tailoring
screening to an individual’
s risk level could improve the
efficiency of the screening program and reduce its adverse
consequences.2-7
Screening for breast cancer reduces deaths from the
cancer.8 However, the trade-offs include overdiagnosis and
overtreatment. Overdiagnosis is the detection by screening of
tumors that would not have presented clinically in a person’
s
lifetime in the absence of screening. The Independent UK
Panel on Breast Cancer Screening8 estimated that for every
10 000 women in the United Kingdom aged 50 years attend-
ing screening for the next 20 years, 56 deaths from breast
cancer would be prevented, and 101 patients with breast can-
cer would be overdiagnosed. A cost-effectiveness analysis of
the United Kingdom breast screening program, based on the
findings of the Panel, showed that the program, compared
with no screening, has 45% probability of being cost-effective
at a threshold of £20 000 (US $26 800) per quality-adjusted
life-year (QALY) gained.9
Genetic, lifestyle, and reproductive factors affect a wom-
an’
s risk for breast cancer. To date, genome-wide association
studies have identified 310 breast cancer susceptibility loci10
that explain approximately 18% of the excess familial risk of
breast cancer, with approximately 28% attributable to poten-
tially all common variants in the genome.10 Assuming a log-
additive model of interaction between loci, the known loci
define a polygenic risk profile with a variance for the log
relative risk distribution of 0.26. The estimated relative risks
at the 1st and 99th percentiles are 0.22 and 3.55, respectively,
compared with the average (population) risk. When the
genetic susceptibility variants are combined with other epi-
demiological risk factors,11 the estimated relative risk at the
99th percentile increases to 4.67. Such a distribution could be
used for risk stratification in screening programs at the popu-
lation level.4
While the average 10-year absolute risk of breast cancer
in women aged 50 years in the United Kingdom is 2.85%,
women at the lowest and highest percentiles of the risk dis-
tribution have 0.53% and 9.96% 10-year risk, respectively
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Offering screening to women
at higher risk while sparing women whose risk is too low to
justify the harms of screening may improve the benefit-to-
harm ratio of screening. Risk-stratified screening would
require assessing risk of all women, which would entail addi-
tional costs. However, these may be offset by eliminating
repeated screening of women at lower risk and avoiding
treatment of overdiagnosed cancers.
The aim of this study was to assess the benefit-to-harm
ratio and cost-effectiveness of risk-stratified breast screen-
ing strategies that vary in risk threshold, using findings of
the Independent UK Panel on Breast Cancer Screening and
taking into account the uncertainty of the estimated ben-
efits, harms, and costs.
Methods
Model Design
We used the life-table model that was developed to evaluate
the cost-effectiveness of the National Health Service (NHS)
Breast Screening Programme (NHSBSP)9 and extended it to ac-
count for risk-stratified screening. We simulated 3 hypotheti-
cal cohorts of 50-year-old women free of breast cancer fol-
lowed up for 35 years. Each cohort consisted of 364 500
women, which is the 2009 population of 50-year-old women
in England and Wales.12 The first cohort received no screen-
ing. The second cohort was offered breast screening mam-
mography at age 50 years and every 3 years thereafter until age
69 years (ie, simulating the NHSBSP). And in the third cohort,
risk estimation was carried out, and only the proportion of
womeninthepopulationwithariskscoregreaterthanathresh-
old risk were offered screening every 3 years from age 50 years
until age 69 years.
Risk Distribution
For the base case model, we used a variance for the risk dis-
tribution of 0.43, which corresponds to both (1) the mid
value between variance based on the known loci and on all
the potential variants in the genome and (2) the combined
variance of the known loci and epidemiological risk factors.11
Assuming a log-additive model of interaction between
genetic and epidemiological risk factors,13 the distribution of
risk on a relative risk scale is log-normal.14 The percentile
rank associated with a given risk score (relative risk or age-
conditional absolute risk) in the population or in cases can
be calculated given the mean and variance of the log-normal
relative risk distribution. We estimated (1) the proportion of
the population that has a risk score greater than a given
absolute risk threshold and (2) the proportion of cases that
will occur within this high-risk subgroup. We calculated the
relative risk associated with a risk score in the higher- and
lower-risk subgroups considering truncated log-normal rela-
tive risk distribution.
Key Points
Question Can risk-stratified screening for breast cancer improve
the cost-effectiveness and benefit-to-harm ratio of screening
programs?
Findings In this cost-effectiveness study, a life-table model of
a hypothetical cohort of 364 500 women finds that targeting
screening to women at higher risk of breast cancer is associated
with reduced overdiagnosis and reduced cost of screening without
compromising quality-adjusted life-years gained and while
maintaining reduced breast cancer deaths.
Meaning The cost-effectiveness and the benefit-to-harm ratio of
breast screening programs could be improved by adopting a
risk-stratified screening strategy.

 Input Parameters
We constructed a life table based on the predicted rates of age-
specific incidence of breast cancer, breast cancer–specific mor-
tality in the screened and unscreened population, and mor-
talityfromothercausesamongwomenwithandwithoutbreast
cancer. The estimation of the input parameters for the life-
table models and the underlying assumptions have been
described previously9 and are summarized in eTable 1 in the
Supplement. We calculated the incidence and the cancer-
specific mortality rates in the higher- and lower-risk groups by
multiplying the overall predicted rates by the relative risk as-
sociated with a given risk score in the higher- and lower-risk
subgroups. We applied the overdiagnosis estimate of the UK
Independent Panel on Breast Cancer Screening to the num-
ber of cancers diagnosed in the higher-risk group (ie, in the
screened group) during the screening period to calculate the
number of overdiagnoses.
We modeled cost-effectiveness of age-based and risk-
stratified screening compared with no screening from the NHS
perspective using NHS costs for the screening program and
treatment of breast cancer. We used an empirical estimate for
the cost of risk assessment and literature-based estimates for
the utility weights.
Model Outputs
Model outputs included number of breast cancer diagnoses,
number overdiagnosed, number of deaths from breast
cancer, number of deaths from other causes, person-years of
survival, QALYs, and total costs. The benefit-to-harm ratio
was measured as the ratio of overdiagnoses to breast cancer
deaths prevented.
Sensitivity Analysis
We studied 99 scenarios of risk-stratified screening strate-
gies corresponding to each percentile risk score. In univari-
ate deterministic sensitivity analysis, we varied the cost of
risk estimation, adherence to screening recommendation,
the variance of the risk distribution, and baseline incidence
of breast cancer and examined the effects on the study out-
comes. To account for the uncertainty in the estimated
input parameters, we ran probabilistic sensitivity analyses
by recalculating the output of the model after sampling
independently each parameter from an underlying probabi-
listic distribution (eTable 1 in the Supplement). We recalcu-
lated the model 2000 times for each of the screening strate-
gies: no screening, age-based screening, and risk-stratified
screening.
Cost-effectiveness Analysis
We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
(ICER) as the difference in mean costs (based on the 2000
simulations) between the screened and unscreened cohorts
divided by the difference in mean QALYs between the 2
cohorts. We calculated the net monetary benefit (NMB) for
no screening, age-based screening, and for the 99 scenarios
of risk-stratified screening as the mean QALYs multiplied by
a given willingness to pay (WTP) for a QALY, minus the total
cost. The screening strategy with the highest NMB for a
given WTP was considered the most cost-effective. We cal-
culated incremental NMBs (screening vs no screening) to
generate cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, which are a
summary of the proportion of times the incremental NMB is
positive, ie, that the screening strategy is cost-effective com-
pared with no screening, for a given WTP for a QALY. All
future costs and health outcomes were discounted at a rate
of 3.5%.15 The analysis was performed using STATA/SE
version 14.0.
Results
Benefits and Harms of Screening
eFigure 2 in the Supplement compares the model-based esti-
mate of age-specific breast cancer incidence to the observed
age-specific incidence for 2009. eTable 2 in the Supplement
details the mean of the key outputs under the base case
scenario for the screened (age-based and risk-based) and the
unscreenedcohorts,following2000simulationsanddiscount-
ing at 3.5%.
Among the 364 500 hypothetical women aged 50 years
followed up to age 85 years, there were 1913 (95% CI, 842-
2714) fewer deaths from breast cancer and 3819 (95% CI, 2309-
5291) overdiagnosed breast cancers in the age-based screened
cohort than in the unscreened cohort. In the risk-based screen-
ing, as the risk threshold for screening increased, ie, a lower
proportion of the population screened, the number of over-
diagnosed breast cancers and the number of breast cancer
deaths prevented decreased. The ratio of overdiagnosis to can-
cer death prevented increased from 0.07 at the 99th percen-
tile of the risk distribution (ie, 1% of the population with risk
above the risk threshold and screened) to 0.99 at the 71st per-
centile and to 2.01 at the 1st percentile (Figure 1). There were
more overdiagnosed cases than breast cancer deaths pre-
vented when screening was targeted to women at a risk thresh-
old of 70th percentile or less.

 Cost-effectiveness
Compared with no screening, age-based screening was associ-
ated with an additional 1916 QALYs (95% CI, 2073-6073) at an
additional cost of £41.9 M (95% CI, £41.7 million to £69.3 mil-
lion) (to convert to US $, multiply by 1.34), giving an incremen-
tal cost-effectiveness ratio of £21 854 per QALY gained. In the
risk-based screening, compared with no screening, the incre-
mental cost increased linearly from £17.2 million to £60.2 mil-
lion as the percentile risk threshold was lowered, while the in-
cremental QALY increased from 258 to 2000 almost reaching
aplateaubythe35thpercentileoftheriskdistribution(Figure2).
TheICERatthe1stpercentileoftheriskdistributionwas£30107
per QALY gained, and this declined when the risk threshold in-
creased, with a minimum value of £11 911 per QALY at the 77th

Net Monetary Benefit
eFigure 4 in the Supplement shows the probability of risk-
based screening being cost-effective at WTP thresholds of
£20 000 and £30 000 per QALY gained. At the £20 000 thresh-
old, targeting screening to women at the 71st or 70th percen-
tile of the risk distribution was the most cost-effective strat-
egy with a 72% probability of being cost-effective. eFigure 5

lated to each risk-stratified screening scenario; eFigure 6 in the

Selection of the Optimal Screening Strategies
The Table details the key outcomes per year of 5 risk-
stratifiedscreeningscenariosfor10000womencomparedwith
age-based screening, where the risk cutoff was set at the 10th,
25th,32nd,62nd,and70thpercentiles.The10thpercentilerisk
cutoff scenario corresponded to a very low–risk group (less
than 1% 10-year absolute risk); the 25th percentile, ICER of
risk-based screening lower than ICER of age-based screen-
ing (1.48% 10-year risk); the 32nd percentile, ICER lower
than £20 000 per QALY (1.69% 10-year risk); the 62nd per-
centile, incremental QALYs more than that of age-based
screening (2.81% 10-year risk); and the 70th percentile, the
highest NMB at a WTP threshold of £20 000 per QALY
gained (3.24% 10-year risk). At the 70th percentile risk
threshold, the program would cost £537 985 less, yield 443
more QALYs, have 75 (71.4%) fewer overdiagnoses, and
avert 23 (9.6%) fewer breast cancer deaths, compared with
age-based screening. In contrast, at the 32nd percentile risk
threshold, the program would cost £20 066 less, yield 450
more QALYs, have 27 (26.7%) fewer overdiagnoses, and
avert 7 (2.9%) fewer breast cancer deaths.
Discussion
A risk-stratified screening strategy could improve the benefit-
to-harm ratio and the cost-effectiveness of the breast screen-
ing program. The relationship between the cost of the
program and the QALYs gained shows diminishing return with
offering screening to women at lower risk. The lower the risk
threshold, ie, the larger the proportion of women offered
screening, the higher would be the cost of the program, while
the gain in QALYs would flatten off after a certain risk thresh-
old. Lowering the risk threshold for screening would increase
overdiagnosis to a greater extent than it would reduce breast
cancer deaths.
The European Guide on Quality Improvement in Compre-
hensive Cancer Control16 recommends quantitative estima-
tion of the benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of a screen-
ing program to decide on implementation. The National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence17 recommends a cost-
effectiveness threshold of £20 000 per QALY gained. How-
ever, there is no threshold for benefit-to-harm ratio. Of the

 cost-effective risk-stratified screening strategies, the optimal
strategy would depend on the harm-benefit trade-offs deemed
acceptable.
There are different approaches to risk-stratified screen-
ing. One approach would be to tailor screening modality, fre-
quency, and start and stop age to an individual’
s risk level.
Other approaches include either (1) intensified screening for
those at higher than a certain risk threshold, while those at
lower risk receive the standard screening; or (2) offering no
screening for those at lower risk, while those above the risk
threshold receive the standard screening.18 We have mod-
eled the second approach because of limited data available to
model fully tailored screening. Yet it is not known how an in-
dividual’
s risk relates to the biology and the natural history of
thetumororhowthesefactorsrelatetotheoutcomesofscreen-
ing. The interscreening interval depends on the sojourn time,
ie, the preclinical screen-detectable period, and it is not known
whether the sojourn time varies by risk level. Therefore, risk
level currently provides limited guidance on how to vary the
screening interval. Although much is known about the varia-
tion of mammographic sensitivity with breast cancer, it is not
known how mammographic sensitivity compares between
younger and older women at similarly higher risk. There are
no direct estimates on the performance of supplemental
screening modalities by risk and their effect on cancer spe-
cific mortality.
There are several studies that have evaluated the cost-
effectiveness of tailoring the screening interval by breast
cancer risk and mammographic density.6,7,19,20 The uncer-
tainties in the key input parameters (detection rate, sensi-
tivity, and mortality) due to lack of robust data made the
findings of these studies only indicative.20 All of these stud-
ies suggest that risk-tailored screening could reduce harms
and costs of screening.
We have estimated that for every 10 000 women aged 50
years who undergo age-based screening for the next 20 years
in the United Kingdom, 52 deaths from breast cancer will be
prevented, and 105 patients with breast cancer will be over-
diagnosed. These data are comparable to the estimates of the
Independent UK Panel on Breast Cancer Screening (56 breast
cancerdeathsand101overdiagnoses),8whichsuggeststhatour
model is reasonably robust.
Implementation of a risk-based screening program raises
several challenges. These include (1) ensuring that genetic test-
ing for stratification and eligibility for screening are acceptable
tothepublicandthehealthcareprofessionals;(2)preparingand
trainingtheworkforce;(3)ensuringequitableaccess;and(4)hav-
ingregulatoryapprovals.18,21Evansandcolleagues22havefound
it is feasible to collect saliva for DNA extraction and genotyp-
ing of women attending the NHSBSP.22 Studies based on sur-
veys suggest that women would accept undergoing genetic
profiling to determine the frequency of screening.23,24 Yet no
data exist on uptake of screening by risk group.
Unlike previously published studies of cost-effective-
ness of risk-stratified screening, the present study modeled no
screening for women at lower risk and standard screening for
those at higher risk. In the setting of an established screening
program, as in breast cancer, it may be more feasible to have a
gradual introduction of risk-based screening by initially tar-
geting screening to a subset of the population above a certain
risk threshold. However, not offering screening to women at
lower risk may not be acceptable24 because women have been
encouraged to see screening as universally beneficial, and re-
duction in screening could be seen as service rationing.25 It is
important to engage the public in decisions about screening
program modification, to base the decision on robust evi-
dence, and to communicate clearly the benefits and harms of
screening.

 lack of data, we opted to develop a less complex model. We
used a life-table modeling approach based on estimates from
theIndependentUKPanelonBreastCancerScreening.Weused
overall cost of the NHSBSP, rather than unit costs of re-
sources used, and utility decrement for cancer diagnosis re-
gardless of cancer stage. Gray and colleagues20 have evalu-
ated the cost-effectiveness of screening under the NHSBSP
protocol compared with no screening using a decision ana-
lytic model taking into account the natural history of breast
cancer and based on continuous time and tumor size growth
model.Theyhaveusedunitcostsandutilitiesthatvarybystage
of breast cancer.20 Both analyses gave comparable ICERs
(£21 854 and £23 197, respectively).
We have assumed that the probability of overdiagnosis
does not vary by risk. This may not be the case. Studies in
prostate cancer have shown that the probability of overdiag-
nosis is inversely associated with polygenic risk.2,3 There
are no estimates yet on the association of overdiagnosis by
risk in breast cancer. If increased risk is linked to increased
risk of progression of the tumor, ie, shorter sojourn time,
then overdiagnosis would be lower.26 However, this associa-
tion is unlikely to substantially affect our estimates because
the mean sojourn time of breast cancer is relatively short
(2-4 years),27,28 and lower probabilities of overdiagnosis
have been accounted for in the probabilistic sensitivity
analysis.
Conclusions
The cost-effectiveness and the benefit-to-harm ratio of the
NHSBSPcouldbeimprovedbyadoptingarisk-stratifiedscreen-
ing strategy. The optimal risk threshold for risk-stratified
screening depends on the acceptable trade-off between im-
proving cost-effectiveness and maximizing benefits and mini-
mizing harms of screening. Not offering screening to women
in the lower tertile of the risk distribution would improve the
cost-effectiveness of the breast screening program, reduce
overdiagnosis while maintaining the benefits of screening.
Robust data are needed to evaluate fully risk-tailored screen-
ing. Policy makers, health professionals, the public, and the
scientific community have to work together to enable provi-
sion of screening program that can do more good than harm
at an affordable cost.
