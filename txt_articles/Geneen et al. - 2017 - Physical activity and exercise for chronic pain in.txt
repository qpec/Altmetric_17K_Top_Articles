Background
Chronic pain is defined as pain lasting beyond normal tissue healing time, generally taken to be 12 weeks. It contributes to disability,
anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, poor quality of life, and healthcare costs. Chronic pain has a weighted mean prevalence in adults
of 20%.
For many years, the treatment choice for chronic pain included recommendations for rest and inactivity. However, exercise may have
specific benefits in reducing the severity of chronic pain, as well as more general benefits associated with improved overall physical and
mental health, and physical functioning.
Physical activity and exercise programmes are increasingly being promoted and offered in various healthcare systems, and for a variety of
chronic pain conditions. It is therefore important at this stage to establish the efficacy and safety of these programmes, and furthermore
to address the critical factors that determine their success or failure.
Objectives
To provide an overview of Cochrane Reviews of adults with chronic pain to determine (1) the effectiveness of different physical activity
and exercise interventions in reducing pain severity and its impact on function, quality of life, and healthcare use; and (2) the evidence
for any adverse effects or harm associated with physical activity and exercise interventions.
Methods
We searched theCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) on the Cochrane Library (CDSR 2016, Issue 1) for systematic reviews
of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), after which we tracked any included reviews for updates, and tracked protocols in case of full
review publication until an arbitrary cut-off date of 21 March 2016 (CDSR 2016, Issue 3). We assessed the methodological quality of
the reviews using the AMSTAR tool, and also planned to analyse data for each painful condition based on quality of the evidence.

Physical activity and exercise for chronic pain in adults: an overview of Cochrane Reviews (Review)
Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. on behalf of The
Cochrane Collaboration.
 We extracted data for (1) self-reported pain severity, (2) physical function (objectively or subjectively measured), (3) psychological
function, (4) quality of life, (5) adherence to the prescribed intervention, (6) healthcare use/attendance, (7) adverse events, and (8)
death.
Due to the limited data available, we were unable to directly compare and analyse interventions, and have instead reported the evidence
qualitatively.
Main results
We included 21 reviews with 381 included studies and 37,143 participants. Of these, 264 studies (19,642 participants) examined
exercise versus no exercise/minimal intervention in adults with chronic pain and were used in the qualitative analysis.
Pain conditions included rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, low back pain, intermittent claudication, dysmenorrhoea,
mechanical neck disorder, spinal cord injury, postpolio syndrome, and patellofemoral pain. None of the reviews assessed ’chronic pain’
or ’chronic widespread pain’ as a general term or specific condition. Interventions included aerobic, strength, flexibility, range of motion,
and core or balance training programmes, as well as yoga, Pilates, and tai chi.
Reviews were well performed and reported (based on AMSTAR), and included studies had acceptable risk of bias (with inadequate
reporting of attrition and reporting biases). However the quality of evidence was low due to participant numbers (most included studies
had fewer than 50 participants in total), length of intervention and follow-up (rarely assessed beyond three to six months). We pooled
the results from relevant reviews where appropriate, though results should be interpreted with caution due to the low quality evidence.
Pain severity: several reviews noted favourable results from exercise: only three reviews that reported pain severity found no statistically
significant changes in usual or mean pain from any intervention. However, results were inconsistent across interventions and follow-
up, as exercise did not consistently bring about a change (positive or negative) in self-reported pain scores at any single point.
Physical function: was the most commonly reported outcome measure. Physical function was significantly improved as a result of the
intervention in 14 reviews, though even these statistically significant results had only small-to-moderate effect sizes (only one review
reported large effect sizes).
Psychological function and quality of life: had variable results: results were either favourable to exercise (generally small and moderate
effect size, with two reviews reporting significant, large effect sizes for quality of life), or showed no difference between groups. There
were no negative effects.
Adherence to the prescribed intervention: could not be assessed in any review. However, risk of withdrawal/dropout was slightly
higher in the exercising group (82.8/1000 participants versus 81/1000 participants), though the group difference was non-significant.
Healthcare use/attendance: was not reported in any review.
Adverse events, potential harm, and death: only 25% of included studies (across 18 reviews) actively reported adverse events. Based
on the available evidence, most adverse events were increased soreness or muscle pain, which reportedly subsided after a few weeks
of the intervention. Only one review reported death separately to other adverse events: the intervention was protective against death
(based on the available evidence), though did not reach statistical significance.
Authors’ conclusions
The quality of the evidence examining physical activity and exercise for chronic pain is low. This is largely due to small sample sizes
and potentially underpowered studies. A number of studies had adequately long interventions, but planned follow-up was limited to
less than one year in all but six reviews.
There were some favourable effects in reduction in pain severity and improved physical function, though these were mostly of small-
to-moderate effect, and were not consistent across the reviews. There were variable effects for psychological function and quality of life.
The available evidence suggests physical activity and exercise is an intervention with few adverse events that may improve pain severity
and physical function, and consequent quality of life. However, further research is required and should focus on increasing participant
numbers, including participants with a broader spectrum of pain severity, and lengthening both the intervention itself, and the follow-
up period.

 Physical activity and exercise for chronic pain in adults - an overview of Cochrane Reviews
Background
Chronic (long-term) pain is pain that has lasted beyond the body’s usual healing time. It is often described as pain that has lasted for
at least three months. Chronic pain causes many problems, beyond the pain itself, including fatigue, anxiety, depression, and a poor
quality of life.
In the past, people with chronic pain were told to rest. However, general advice now is to keep active - whether to affect the pain directly
or to combat the other problems associated with it. Therefore, research studies have attempted to examine the effect of physical activity
in people with chronic pain.
This overview aimed to bring together and analyse any reviews published by Cochrane that looked at physical activity and exercise
studies in any chronic pain condition, including arthritis, back and neck pain, and menstrual (period) pain.
Key results and quality of the evidence
In January 2016, we identified 21 Cochrane Reviews which covered 10 different diagnoses (osteoarthritis (a joint disease), rheumatoid
arthritis (joint pain and swelling), fibromyalgia (widespread pain condition), low back pain, intermittent claudication (cramping pain
in the legs), dysmenorrhoea (period pain), mechanical neck disorders (neck pain), spinal cord injury, postpolio syndrome (a condition
occurring in people who have had polio), patellofemoral pain (pain at the front of the knee)). The physical activity or exercise programme
used in the trials ranged in frequency, intensity, and type, including land- and water-based activities, those focusing on building strength,
endurance, flexibility and range of motion, and muscle activation exercises.
The quality of the evidence was low. This was mostly due to the small numbers of people with chronic pain who participated in each
reviewed study. Ideally, a study should have hundreds of people assigned to each group, whereas most of the studies included in the
review process here had fewer than 50 people in total.
There was evidence that physical activity reduced the severity of pain, improved physical function, and had a variable effect on both
psychological function and quality of life. However, these results were not found in all studies. The inconsistency could be due to the
quality of the studies or because of the mix of different types of physical activity tested in the studies. Additionally, participants had
predominantly mild-to-moderate pain, not moderate-to-severe pain.
Conclusions
According to the available evidence (only 25% of included studies reported on possible harm or injury from the intervention), physical
activity did not cause harm. Muscle soreness that sometimes occurs with starting a new exercise subsided as the participants adapted
to the new activities. This is important as it shows physical activity in general is acceptable and unlikely to cause harm in people with
chronic pain, many of whom may have previously feared it would increase their pain further.
Future studies should focus on increasing participant numbers, including a wider range of severity of pain (more people with more
severe pain), and lengthening both the intervention (exercise programme) itself, and the follow-up period. This pain is chronic in
nature, and so a long-term intervention, with longer periods of recovery or follow-up, may be more effective.

Description of the condition
Chronic pain has been defined as pain lasting beyond normal tis-
sue healing time, generally taken to be 12 weeks (International
Association for the Study of Chronic Pain; Merskey 2011). It con-
tributes to disability, anxiety and depression, sleep disturbances,
poor quality of life, and healthcare costs (Leadley 2014; Moore
2014a; Park 2012).
Chronic pain has a weighted mean prevalence in adults of 20%
(Breivik 2006; Moore 2014a), which increases as the population
ages (32% of adults aged 25 to 34 years, 62% of adults over 75

 years; Abdulla 2013; Elliott 1999). This is a greater proportion
than people with asthma (To 2012) or diabetes (IDF 2012) in the
same population (van Hecke 2013a). The World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) recognises chronic pain as a public health problem
throughout the world, with one systematic review assessing the
growing evidence that the prevalence of chronic pain in the gen-
eral population is high internationally (34% in low-income coun-
tries and 30% in high-income countries; Elzahaf 2012). Chronic
painful conditions comprise four of the 10 highest ranking con-
ditions for years lived with disability in 2013 (Vos 2015), and are
responsible for considerable loss of quality of life and employment,
and increased healthcare costs (Moore 2014b). Despite this, the
term ’chronic pain’ was only added as a MeSH term in MEDLINE
in January 2012 (National Library of Medicine), highlighting the
relatively small proportion of specific research dedicated to this
population.
Certain factors can contribute to an increased risk of chronic pain
(female gender, older age, lower socioeconomic status, geographi-
cal and cultural background, and genetics; Smith 2007; van Hecke
2013b). Other factors associated with chronic pain conditions are
modifiable, such as smoking status, alcohol intake, nutrition, obe-
sity, comorbidities, employment status and occupational factors,
and physical activity level (Smith 2007; van Hecke 2013a).
A review of current issues in the treatment of chronic pain strongly
suggests that health professionals traditionally focus on biomedical
viewsof pain,utilisingpharmacologyfirstandforemost,andsome-
times not addressing potential non-pharmacological approaches
such as physical activity and changing attitudes towards chronic
pain (Schofield 2011). Guidance often suggests that lifestyle ad-
vice is important: for example, the National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence (NICE) osteoarthritis guidelines state that
“exercise should be a core treatment ... irrespective of age, comor-
bidity, pain severity and disability. Exercise should include: local
muscle strengthening [and] general aerobic fitness” (NICE 2014).
Non-pharmacological treatments have been developed, investi-
gated, and implemented, with Cochrane Reviews and proto-
cols evaluating the available evidence for psychological, physical,
and other non-medical interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioural
and behavioural therapy, Eccleston 2014; Williams 2012; TENS,
Nnoaham 2008; low-impact/intensity movement/exercise ther-
apy, Wieland 2013; dietary, Straube 2015; and patient education,
Engers 2008; Gross 2009). While evidence for the effectiveness of
these interventions is of variable quantity and quality, the 2013
Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) guidelines on
the management of chronic pain made strong recommendations
on the use of exercise, based on evidence drawn from randomised
controlled trials (RCTs), stating: “exercise and exercise therapies,
regardless of their form, are recommended in the management of
patients with chronic pain” (SIGN 2013).
Description of the interventions
Physical activity has been defined by the WHO as “any bodily
movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy ex-
penditure, including activities undertaken while working, playing,
carrying out household chores, travelling, and engaging in recre-
ational pursuits” (WHO 2015). WHO also states that “exercise ...
is a sub-category of physical activity that is planned, structured,
repetitive, and aims to improve or maintain one or more compo-
nents of physical fitness” (WHO 2015).
Physical activity for health can take many different forms: it can
be structured exercise, such as in classes, gym-based, or a DVD
or programme performed at home; or unstructured and involve
adding just a few small activities each day (activities of daily living).
Physical activity and exercise can also vary in intensity, duration,
and type: aerobic (such as walking) or more focused on increasing
flexibility, strength, or balance. Physical activity and exercise can
also be taught (or led) by another individual such as an exercise
professional, or initiated and maintained through the person’s own
initiative and motivation.
Both physical activity and exercise can be performed on land or in
the water, and can range from whole-body to localised (body site-
specific) training. Most forms of exercise can also be modified to
be performed where there is restricted movement (e.g. in a chair,
a bed, or another assistive device).
How the intervention might work
Physical activity and exercise can be adapted for an individual, and
is something people can do to help themselves. It is likely to be
associated with minimal adverse effects, such as interactions with
medication and potential for abuse in adults with chronic pain,
when compared to pharmaceutical and surgical interventions. It is
therefore an attractive option to help manage an individual’s pain
if the systematic reviews show benefit. However, current evidence
suggests that simply giving an individual advice to exercise is in-
sufficient to bring about significant change (SIGN 2013), and a
badly prescribed intervention that does not consider the individ-
ual’s conditions and present state of health and fitness, such as one
that does not incorporate pacing or gradual progression, may bring
about adverse events such as pain ’flare-ups’, or lead to cardiac or
respiratory events (American College of Sports Medicine 2007).
This suggests that supervised or structured interventions may be
more fruitful, though this is currently unconfirmed.
Since the 1980s, primary care physician advice for treating pain
has changed, moving away from “rest”, to minimising or elimi-
nating bedrest and instead remaining active (back pain, Waddell
1987). Exercise may have specific benefits in reducing the severity
of chronic pain, as well as more general benefits associated with
improved overall physical and mental health, and physical func-
tioning of people with chronic pain, as depression (Finan 2013),
deconditioning (Bousema 2007), and obesity are commonly ob-
served in these people (headache/migraine, Bigal 2012; fibromyal-
gia, Ursini 2011). For example, studies have revealed that a sin-

 gle bout of exercise increases the production of endogenous opi-
oids, leading to transient anti-nociception in both animals and
humans, and repeated exercise produces long-lasting anti-nocicep-
tion in otherwise untreated animals (Stagg 2011). Aerobic exer-
cise is also strongly linked to weight loss (Messier 2013), which in
turn has implications for the management of chronic pain as the
pressure on joints is reduced. Alternatively, resistance exercise, or
other forms of strength training, can improve the person’s capac-
ity to support bone and cartilage through improved musculature
supporting movement around a joint, with potential to relieve
stiffness (Mayer 2008) and bringing about some pain relief. Re-
sistance training through repetitive full range-of-motion exercise
around the lumbar spine (in chronic low back pain) may affect disc
metabolism itself, with the possibility that the exercise programme
could improve metabolic exchange in the lumbar discs and aid in
repair (Mooney 2006). Training to improve balance and flexibility
also has benefits as it reduces the risk of falls, and the potential for
further pain or injury (Harvard 2013).
Why it is important to do this overview
If physical activity and exercise interventions are shown to ef-
fectively and safely reduce pain intensity or frequency (or both),
they are likely to be a preferable alternative or adjunct therapy to
pharmacological/surgical treatments for chronic pain. The inter-
ventions could promote personal involvement of individuals in
the management of their pain, thus increasing self-efficacy and
the ability to self-manage. In turn this could lead to an increase
in overall quality of life and a consequent reduction in health-
care use. In addition, exercise is of great importance for cardio-
vascular (Vigorito 2014) and bone health (Sakuma 2012). Re-
duced physical function and consequent lack of mobility in people
with chronic pain is associated with increased all-cause and car-
diovascular mortality (Nüesch 2011), with other studies linking
severe chronic pain to general increased all-cause mortality (Moore
2014a; Torrance 2010).
Physical activity and exercise programmes are increasingly being
promoted and offered in various healthcare systems (American
College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) ’Exercise is Medicine’ global
pledge at the Inaugural World Congress 2010) and for a variety of
chronic pain conditions, including arthritis (Fransen 2014; Silva
2010), fibromyalgia (Busch 2013), and dysmenorrhoea (Brown
2010). At this stage it is important to establish the efficacy and
safety of these programmes, and furthermore to address the critical
factors that determine their success or failure.
It is therefore important to identify whether (and how) exercise
interventions can be effectively and safely applied in people with
chronic pain.
With a number of systematic reviews published by Cochrane eval-
uating the effectiveness of exercise in various painful conditions, it
is timely and important to bring together all relevant published in-
formation to evaluate the current evidence, and identify the avail-
ability and quality of evidence-based exercise interventions. This
overview will determine the extent to which the published sys-
tematic reviews have accurately assessed the evidence for exercise
in chronic pain conditions/syndromes, which will help to direct
future guidelines and identify current research gaps.
O B J E C T I V E S
To provide an overview of Cochrane Reviews of adults with
chronic pain to determine (1) the effectiveness of different phys-
ical activity and exercise interventions in reducing pain severity
and its impact on function, quality of life, and healthcare use; and
(2) the evidence for any adverse effects or harm associated with
physical activity and exercise interventions.

Criteria for considering reviews for inclusion
We included only systematic reviews of RCTs of physical activity
and exercise in participants with chronic pain, and published in
the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The included reviews
had to fulfil the following criteria:
Participants
Adults (aged 18 years and over) reporting chronic non-cancer pain,
including persistent (e.g. chronic back pain, fibromyalgia) and
intermittent (e.g. migraine, dysmenorrhoea) pain, for at least three
months (12 weeks) in any body site.
Intervention
Reviews of RCTs assessing physical activity or exercise as the inter-
vention (any reviews where that assessed physical activity or exer-
cise as a stand-alone intervention). This included physical activity
interventions that could be initially taught by an exercise profes-
sional, or involve periodical/ongoing supervision.
Exclusions
Interventions not deemed physical activity or exercise using the
WHO definition, such as manipulation, mobilisation, or passive
movement. Any multi-modal interventions were excluded if phys-
ical activity/exercise could not be assessed for effect (the effect of
exercise must have been measured distinctly).

Physical activity and exercise for chronic pain in adults: an overview of Cochrane Reviews (Review)

Cochrane Collaboration.
 Comparison
Usual care, waiting list control, placebo/sham treatment, other
treatment, or a combination of treatments (as long as the effect of
exercise could be measured distinctly).
Primary outcome
• self-reported pain (severity).
This could be presented and analysed as change on a continuous
scale, the proportion of participants who ’responded’, or, ideally,
in a dichotomised format as the proportion of participants in each
group who achieved a predetermined threshold of improvement
(e.g. outcome in individual participants of at least 50% pain in-
tensity reduction, or no worse than mild pain, at the end of the
trial, with at least 30% pain intensity reduction as a secondary
outcome, or recovery; Moore 2013).
Secondary outcomes
• Physical function (objectively or subjectively measured).
• Psychological function.
• Quality of life.
• Adherence to the prescribed intervention.
• Healthcare use/attendance.
• Adverse events (not death).
• Death.
Reviews may not always report specifically on activity or exercise
for chronic pain in adults. We anticipated two possible circum-
stances which might have arisen.
• A review included some interventions of interest or reported
only some outcomes of interest. In this case we extracted the
interventions and outcomes of interest, but we did not include
interventions or outcomes outside the scope of this overview.
• Reviews occasionally included papers that included children
and adults together, but the results for adults were not reported
or analysed separately in the included papers or the review. In
this case we made a judgement as to whether the review could be
included based on the proportion of adults. Our intention was to
include only those reviews where more than 80% of participants
were adults.
Search methods for identification of reviews
We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR),
2016, Issue 1, on the Cochrane Library for relevant reviews using
the search strategy: (pain or migraine or headache) and (exercise or
activity or physical). We did not seek non-Cochrane reviews.
Data collection and analysis
Two overview authors (LG, CC) independently carried out
searches and selected reviews for inclusion. Disagreements were
resolved through discussion, and a third overview author (RAM)
acted as arbitrator where necessary.
Two overview authors (independently carried out assessment of
methodological quality (LG, CC), and extracted data (LG, RAM).
Any disagreements were resolved through discussion, or involving
a third overview author if necessary (DM).
One overview author (LG) tracked results of the search for the
most up to date version of each review and protocol that fulfilled
the inclusion criteria.
Selection of reviews
Included reviews assessed RCTs of the effects of exercise for pain
management in adults (as defined by individual reviews), com-
pared with any of the listed comparators, and included:
• a clearly defined clinical question;
• details of inclusion and exclusion criteria;
• details of databases searched and relevant search strategies;
• participant-reported pain severity (primary outcome
measure);
• summary results for at least one other desired outcome.
Data extraction and management
Two overview authors (LG, RAM) independently extracted data
from the included review using a standardised data extraction form
and checked for agreement prior to entry into Microsoft Excel for
Windows. We did not extract data from reports included in the
reviews again, neither did we undertake any re-analysis of data
from reviews. Data were not entered for analysis into Cochrane’s
statistical software due to the lack of relevant and comparable data
(RevMan 2014).
We collected the following information (where available) from the
reviews:
• number of included studies and participants;
• intervention (exercise or activity type) and dose (frequency/
intensity);
• comparator;
• condition treated;
• time of assessment;
• duration of follow-up;
• relevant outcomes.
Where possible we extracted risk ratio (RR), number needed to
treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB), mean differ-
ence (MD), and standardised mean difference (SMD), and other
relevant statistical data for the primary and secondary outcomes.
This included:
• obtaining 50% pain relief (participant-reported);

Cochrane Collaboration.
 • obtaining any other measure of ’improvement’ (participant-
reported);
• adverse events;
• death;
• withdrawals.
Assessment of methodological quality of included
reviews
Quality of included reviews
Two overview authors (LG, CC) independently assessed each in-
cluded review to see if it satisfied the criteria specified in the ’as-
sessment of multiple systematic reviews’ (AMSTAR) measurement
tool (Shea 2007), for rigorous methodological quality. Arbitration
by a third overview author (DM) was necessary for some fields.
High quality reviews were required to fulfil each of the established
AMSTAR criteria (further criteria to fulfil each field is listed in
Table 1).
For each review we also planned to assess the likelihood of pub-
lication bias by calculating the number of participants in studies
with zero effect (relative benefit of one) that would be needed to
give an NNTB too high to be clinically relevant (Moore 2008). In
this case we would have considered an NNTB of 10 or greater for
the outcome of participant-reported pain relief of 30% or greater
to be the cut-off for clinical relevance. This method is used as sta-
tistical tests for the presence of publication bias have been shown
to be unhelpful (Thornton 2000). However, assessment of pub-
lication bias was not possible due to the lack of specificity of the
populations included within the reviews, and so we were unable
to extract comparable data.
Quality of evidence in included reviews
We planned to use two main indicators for the quality of evidence:
all included reviews must have used only primary studies that were
both randomised and double-blind, so minimising the risk of bias
from these items; and all included reviews must have included
only people with at least moderate pain intensity at baseline (visual
analogue scale greater than 30/100, categorical rating scale greater
than 1/3, and numerical rating scale greater than 3/10, Collins
1997), providing a sensitive assay of intervention efficacy.
Subsequently, we planned to analyse data for each painful condi-
tion in three tiers, according to outcome and freedom from known
sources of bias.
• The first tier used data meeting current best standards,
where studies reported the outcome of at least 50% pain
intensity reduction from baseline (where 50% was the cut-off for
a dichotomous (yes/no) outcome: was a 50% reduction in pain
observed?), or its equivalent, without using last observation
carried forward (LOCF) or other imputation method for
dropouts, reported an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, lasted
eight or more weeks, had a parallel-group design, and had at least
200 participants (preferably at least 400) in the comparison
(Moore 2010). These top-tier results were usually reported first.
• The second tier used any available data, but where one or
more of these conditions were not met, for example reporting at
least 30% pain intensity reduction, using LOCF or a completer
analysis, lasting four to eight weeks, and where the numbers of
participants were at least 200.
• A third tier of evidence related to small amounts of data
(fewer than 200 participants), or short studies of less than four
weeks, or where there was obvious major heterogeneity between
studies, or where there were other shortcomings in allocation
concealment, considerable attrition, and incomplete outcome
data. For this third tier of evidence, no data synthesis was
reasonable, and may have been misleading, but an indication of
beneficial effects might be possible.
This overview examined the quality of all included reviews accord-
ing to current best standards for reporting in pain. These included
the attempt and ability of the reviews to identify studies/interven-
tions with the maximum evidence of effectiveness, and minimum
risk of bias, including the reporting of the following.
• Outcomes in trials of the proportion of participants
obtaining at least 50% pain intensity reduction, or no worse
than mild pain, at the end of the trial (with at least 30% pain
intensity reduction as a secondary outcome). We did not
consider the use of mean changes in pain scores as high quality
because responses to pain interventions are not Gaussian, and
few people have the mean response.
• Duration of included studies of eight weeks or longer.
• Imputation method of baseline observation carried forward
(BOCF), LOCF, or worst observation carried forward (WOCF)
if adverse event withdrawals were similar in active and control
groups.
• At least 200 participants per treatment group in included
studies, with at least two trials, as a minimum criterion for
trustworthiness of any analysis. Pooled analysis of small studies
may be considered good quality if at least 400 participants were
involved, but we regarded these as being potentially subject to
bias.
We extracted the ’Risk of bias’ as assessed by the original review
authors from included reviews. Counts of low risk of bias were
extracted from relevant studies in the included reviews and tabu-
lated under the following headings to evaluate the proportion of
studies achieving a low risk of bias for each:
• random sequence generation (selection bias);
• allocation concealment (selection bias);
• blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias);
• blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias);
• incomplete outcome data (attrition bias);
• selective reporting (reporting bias);
• sample size;

 • any other biases.
Data synthesis
Additional quantitative analyses were not required, since we only
considered results from properly conducted (Cochrane) reviews.
The aim was to concentrate on specific outcomes such as the pro-
portion of participants with at least 50% pain relief, all-cause or
adverse event discontinuations, or serious adverse events, and to
explore how these can be compared across different treatments for
the same condition. We planned to compare only like with like
(where possible); for example in study duration, which can be an
additional source of bias if insufficient in length (Moore 2010).
However due to the limited data available, we were unable to
directly compare and analyse interventions, and have instead re-
ported the evidence qualitatively only. We had also planned to em-
ploy subgroup analyses assessing age, condition, and intervention
type/intensity, though this was not feasible using the available data
from included reviews. For this reason we have also been unable
to include a ’Summary of findings’ table as planned and stated in
the protocol.
Importantly, we have tried to highlight issues of low trial quality,
inadequate size, and whether trials were truly valid for the partic-
ular condition in making between-therapy comparisons.
We approached each review with four main questions/focus, and
extracted data accordingly.
• Did they report exercise versus non-exercise studies?
• Did the review or studies included in the review (or both)
have low risk of bias?
• Did they have our main outcome?
• What were the actual intervention/s included in the review?
R E S U L T S
We included 21 reviews with 381 included studies, totalling
37,143 participants. Of these, 264 studies (19,642 participants)
examined exercise versus no exercise/minimal intervention in
adults with chronic pain (the focus of this overview) and so were
used in the qualitative analysis.
Description of included reviews
The search strategy was performed in the Cochrane Library only,
and revealed 475 potentially relevant titles, of which 75 were as-
sessed as full papers.
The search was undertaken on 31 January 2016 (CDSR 2016,
Issue 1), after which any included reviews were tracked for updates,
and protocols were followed in case of full review publication until
21 March 2016 (CDSR 2016, Issue 3).
All extracted data and methodological quality assessment were
taken from the most recent published version of the full review.
Ultimately, of the 75 titles requiring further assessment, 10 were
reviews at protocol stage only (five of which have potential to be
included once published as a full review, one which was unclear,
and four that were excluded based on information within the pro-
tocol). Hence, we excluded 54 titles (10 protocols and 44 full re-
views; Figure 1), reasons for which are listed in Table 2.

Specificity of chronic pain condition of included
reviews
Following abstract and full paper assessment, 21 reviews fulfilled
the inclusion criteria: four in rheumatoid arthritis (Cramp 2013;
Han 2004; Hurkmans 2009; Silva 2010), four in osteoarthritis
(Bartels 2007; Fransen 2014; Fransen 2015; Regnaux 2015), three
in fibromyalgia (Bidonde 2014; Busch 2007; Busch 2013), three
in low back pain (Hayden 2005; Saragiotto 2016; Yamato 2015),
two in intermittent claudication (Lane 2014; Lauret 2014), one in
dysmenorrhoea (Brown 2010), one in mechanical neck disorder
(Gross 2015a), one in spinal cord injury (Boldt 2014), one in
postpolio syndrome (Koopman 2015), and one in patellofemoral
pain(van derHeijden2015). None of the includedreviewsassessed
’chronic pain’ or ’chronic widespread pain’ as a general term or
specific condition.
The 21 included reviews were published by five different Cochrane
Review groups: 11 from the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group
(Bartels 2007; Bidonde 2014; Busch 2007; Busch 2013; Cramp
2013; Fransen 2014; Fransen 2015; Han 2004; Hurkmans 2009;
Regnaux 2015; Silva 2010); four from the Cochrane Neck and
Back Group previously the Cochrane Back Group) (Gross 2015a;
Hayden 2005; Saragiotto 2016; Yamato 2015); two from the
Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group (Lane 2014; Lauret
2014); one from the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertil-
ity Group (Brown 2010); one from the Cochrane Injuries Group
(Boldt 2014); one from the Cochrane Neuromuscular Group
(Koopman 2015); and one from the Cochrane Bone, Joint and
Muscle Trauma Group (van der Heijden 2015).
Protocols that may be included in updates of this overview fo-
cus on osteoarthritis (Østerås 2013 from the Cochrane Muscu-
loskeletal Group), migraine (Brønfort 2015 from the Cochrane
Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group), chronic low back
pain (Hayden 2012 from the Cochrane Back Group), ankylosing
spondylitis (Regnaux 2014 from the Cochrane Musculoskeletal
Group), and temporomandibular disorders (Craane 2006 from
the Cochrane Oral Health Group).
Exercise and physical activity interventions
implemented in the included reviews
Interventions assessed included: any specified style of land-based
exercise or physical activity such as one designed to improve
strength, range of movement, aerobic capacity, or a combination
of these (Boldt 2014; Busch 2007; Busch 2013; Cramp 2013;
Fransen 2014; Fransen 2015; Gross 2015a; Hurkmans 2009;
Koopman 2015; Regnaux 2015; van der Heijden 2015); a single
style of land-based exercise only (tai chi only: Han 2004, walk-
ing only: Lauret 2014, walking or jogging only: Brown 2010;
Lane 2014, balance training only: Silva 2010, motor control ex-
ercise only: Saragiotto 2016, Pilates method only: Yamato 2015);
any pool-based or aquatic therapy (Bartels 2007; Bidonde 2014;
Cramp 2013), or “any exercise therapy” (Hayden 2005).
Aquatic exercise
Any exercise performed in water. This can include swimming,
though many studies will be referring to exercises performed ver-
tically in the water (not horizontally), either using the water to
support the body through the exercise, or as resistance against the
body.
Range of motion and flexibility exercise
Can be performed in water or on land. The intention is to increase
the range of motion around a joint through progressive stretching
and mobilising of the muscles around and crossing the joint. For
the purposes of this overview, we only included active movement
where the movement was brought about by the participant, and
not passively moved by an external force such as a therapist.
Aerobic exercise
Can be performed in water or on land. Exercise usually performed
continuously to raise the heart rate and breathing rate for a pro-
longed period. Examples include walking, jogging, running, cy-
cling, and swimming. Often presented as a percentage of the par-
ticipant’s heart rate max (HRmax) - the highest heart rate reached
when performing at their absolute maximum. Similarly it may be
presented as a percentage of VO2max or VO2peak (a proportion
of the maximum amount of oxygen the muscle can take up per
minute), or as an absolute value (mL/kg/minute).
Strength/resistance exercise
Can be performed in water or on land. Exercise performed against
a progressive resistance with the intention of improving muscle
strength, muscle endurance, muscle power, or a combination of
these.Resistance cancome fromfixedorfree weights,elasticbands,
body weight (against gravity), and water resistance. It may also
involve static or isometric strength (holding a position or weight
without moving against it). Often presented as a percentage of
the participant’s one repetition maximum (1-RM) - the maximum
weight they can lift/move if they only have to do it once.

Cochrane Collaboration.
 Motor control exercise
Can be performed in water or on land. Exercise to bring about
activation of the deep trunk muscles, targeting the restoration
of control and co-ordination of these ’core muscles’ (Saragiotto
2016).
Balance (proprioceptive) training
Can be performed in water or on land (water may be used initially
for support). Exercise emphasises the maintenance of balance dur-
ing visual and perturbation challenges with eyes open or closed,
range of motion, and maintaining stability over reduced areas of
support and unstable surface (Silva 2010), that is improving bal-
ance in increasingly unstable situations.
Tai chi
An ancient Chinese discipline developed from martial arts, in-
volving a continuous series of very controlled (and usually slow)
movements designed to improve physical and mental wellbeing.
Yoga
Arising out of Hindu philosophy. Exercise includes breath control,
simple meditation, and the adoption of specific bodily postures. It
is widely practised for health, relaxation, and control (physically
and mentally). Incorporates stretching and flexibility training with
isometric strength training (holding certain poses, with no move-
ment against a resistance).
Pilates
Developed by Joseph Pilates in the 20th Century, it is a system of
exercises (often using special apparatus) designed to improve phys-
ical strength, flexibility, and posture, and enhance mental aware-
ness.
Duration and dose (frequency/intensity) of the
exercise and physical activity interventions
A detailed breakdown of each review can be seen in Table 5.
Duration of intervention
Interventions assessed by the included reviews varied in length
from a single session (Fransen 2015) to 30 months (Fransen 2015).
Only five reviews enforced a minimum intervention period to
reduce risk of bias, and were able to attribute any effects to the
intervention (Brown 2010; Busch 2013; Gross 2015a; Hurkmans
2009; Silva 2010).
Frequency
There was large variation in the exercise or physical activity in-
tervention being implemented, ranging from just once a week
(Bidonde 2014; Busch 2007; Fransen 2014; Fransen 2015; Han
2004; Saragiotto 2016), to twice a day (Boldt 2014), and some
performing a short series of exercises (two-minute duration) ev-
ery 15 minutes during the day (Gross 2015a). However, when
reported, most included studies in the reviews implemented the
programme twice a week (or stated at least twice a week).
Intensity
Few studies quantified the intensity of each session. Baseline inten-
sity was often accepted as low/moderate, with the aim to progress
over the intervention period to 70% to 85% of HRmax or heart
rate reserve (HRR) for aerobic interventions (Brown 2010; Cramp
2013; Hurkmans 2009), 70% to 80% of an individual’s 1-RM, or
50%to70%maximumvoluntarycontraction(Koopman 2015)in
strength/resistance training programmes (Busch 2013; Hurkmans
2009). In other reviews, intensity was described more loosely as
“variable” or “low intensity (very light) to maximum effort (vigor-
ous)” (Bidonde 2014; Fransen 2014; Lane 2014; Regnaux 2015),
“low intensity” (Fransen 2014; Gross 2015a; Han 2004; Silva
2010), or “moderate or moderate-to-high” (Cramp 2013; Fransen
2015).
Duration (per session)
Individual sessions varied in length from two minutes (Gross
2015a), to 90 minutes (Busch 2013; Cramp 2013; Han 2004)
or 120 minutes (Boldt 2014), but mostly situated around 45 to
60 minutes. However, it is important to note that the shorter
sessions were often performed more regularly than longer sessions.
With more information it would have been possible to calculate
total volume of exercise or physical activity (session duration ×
frequency per week × number of weeks), for a more accurate and
detailed analysis.
Intervention specificity for chronic pain in the
included reviews
The focus of this overview was exercise versus no-exercise inter-
ventions with the intention of answering the original question:
is exercise beneficial, detrimental, or ineffective for people with
chronic pain when compared to inactivity? Two of the 21 reviews
did not include/locate any studies that examined simply exercise
versusnoexercise (Lauret 2014; Silva2010). However, manyof the
included reviews compared varying exercise modality, duration,
intensity, and frequency. The “no-exercise” intervention referred
to the control group where there was a minimal intervention (such
as sham exercise or education) or wait-list control/no treatment
(see Table 3 for more information on control group activity).

 Time points reported
Fourof the 19reviewsthatreporteddata,reportedresultsatasingle
time point only (’post-intervention’: Bidonde 2014; Busch 2007;
Cramp 2013; Han 2004). Reviews also analysed outcome mea-
sures immediately post-intervention and at one or more follow-up
points. Each review defined short-, intermediate-, and long-term
follow-up according to their own assessment, so when the time pe-
riod was not mentioned explicitly, we grouped the reviews accord-
ing to the review authors’ own classification only, and where a time
period (weeks, month, years) was explicitly listed but not defined
by the authors, we grouped them as short-term (follow-up as under
six months), intermediate-term (six to 12 months), and long-term
(longer than 12 months): short-term: Busch 2013; Fransen 2014;
Fransen 2015; Gross 2015a; Hayden 2005; Lane 2014; Regnaux
2015; Saragiotto 2016; intermediate-term: Bartels 2007; Fransen
2015; Gross 2015a; Hayden 2005; Lane 2014; Regnaux 2015;
Saragiotto 2016; long-term: Gross 2015a; Hayden 2005; Regnaux
2015; Saragiotto 2016. Five reviews did not report “post-interven-
tion” but at short-term, mid/intermediate-term, and long-term
postrandomisation (short, mid, and long term: Boldt 2014; short
and intermediate term: Koopman 2015; Yamato 2015; short and
long-term: Hurkmans 2009; van der Heijden 2015). One review
assessed participants in an ongoing fashion “over three menstrual
cycles” (Brown 2010).
Long-term follow-up
Of the seven reviews claiming to report “long term” follow-up,
one classed long-term as longer than six weeks (intermediate term
as one to six weeks’ follow-up) (Boldt 2014). The remaining six
reviews defined long-term follow up as over 12 months (one year)
post-intervention (Gross 2015a; Hayden 2005; Hurkmans 2009;
Regnaux 2015; Saragiotto 2016; van der Heijden 2015).
Methodological quality of included reviews
AMSTAR quality assessment of included reviews
No review achieved a perfect score of 11/11, though five achieved
10/11 (Boldt 2014; Busch 2013; Hayden 2005; Koopman 2015;
Regnaux 2015) and eight scored 9/11 (Cramp 2013; Gross 2015a;
Hurkmans 2009; Lane 2014; Lauret 2014; Saragiotto 2016; van
der Heijden 2015; Yamato 2015). The lowest score was 6/11 (
Silva 2010) though five categories were not applicable (n/a) due
to there being no included studies. Quality assessment results for
each individual review are presented in Table 6.
All reviews except one (Bidonde 2014) fulfilled the basic criteria
(questions one to three of Table 1); to follow an ’a priori’ design
as Cochrane implements a system of protocol publication before
undertaking the full reviews, where it also specifies dual study se-
lection and data extraction from a comprehensive literature search.
One review did not fulfil the ’a priori’ design as this was an update
and separation from a broader review series, and so the criteria had
not been explicitly listed prior to publication for this specific title
(Bidonde 2014).
Criteria which scored badly using the AMSTAR tool were charac-
teristics of included studies (question six of Table 1), reporting of
publication bias (question 10 of Table 1), and conflict of interest
declarations (question 11 of Table 1).
• Included study characteristics were limited, often reporting
the “inclusion criteria” used to recruit participants in the study
instead of the characteristics of actual included participants, and
excluding information such as participants’ age, gender split,
ethnicity, and disease status.
• Assessment of publication bias was omitted entirely in five
reviews (Bartels 2007; Fransen 2014; Fransen 2015; Han 2004;
Hurkmans 2009), and when it was assessed, it was reported
using only a simple statement (with no test values, analyses used,
or diagrams to demonstrate the result; Busch 2007; Koopman
2015). Two reviews mentioned in the methods as planned
analyses, though was not mentioned again (Brown 2010; van der
Heijden 2015), and a third review mentioned it in the methods,
but appeared to use it interchangeably with reporting bias
causing great confusion (Bidonde 2014).
• Conflicts of interest were sufficiently reported in only three
out of 21 of the included reviews (Hayden 2005; Koopman
2015; Silva 2010). In the remaining reviews, a cursory statement
was commonly made regarding the review authors’ conflicts of
interests, however, fulfilling the AMSTAR criteria also requires a
statement to be made regarding any conflict of interest for any of
the included studies.
Risk of bias in included reviews
The original review authors assessed risk of bias (see Table 7). The
table shows the number of studies assessed as low risk of bias only,
and excluded those that were assessed as unclear or high risk of
bias.
Selection bias (randomisation and allocation concealment)
Selection bias had the largest proportion of included studies with
low risk of bias (63% and 42% of studies adequately undertaking
and reporting the methods used).
Performance and detection bias (blinding participants,
personnel, outcome assessors)
With anyexercise orphysical activityinterventionitisverydifficult
to blind both participants and personnel to the allocation, though
some studies included in reviews attempted to by offering sham
exercise.
Due to the difficulty of blinding participants to their group allo-
cation, review authors assessed the risk of bias in different ways,

 which may cause confusion: whereas the majority declared this
lack of possible blinding to be high risk of bias or unclear, two re-
views labelled such cases as low risk of bias in order not to exclude
these studies unnecessarily from their analysis (Lane 2014; Lauret
2014). Without these two reviews, only a small percentage (7.8%
or 18/229) of the included studies would have scored low risk of
performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), but by
including them (all 35 studies from those two reviews assessed as
low risk of bias) the overall proportion of studies assessed as having
low risk of bias was closer to 20% (53/264).
Attrition (incomplete outcome data, withdrawals/dropouts)
About 55% (144/264) of the studies included in these reviews
showed low risk of bias.
Reporting bias (selective reporting)
Reporting bias was classed as low risk in only 46% of included
studies. However, it is important to note this was not due to the
remainder having high risk of bias, but instead ’unclear’, as trial
protocols were not always published or accessible to the review
authors to accurately assess/interpret.
Study/sample/group size
Sample size was not always included within the risk of bias assess-
ment. It was therefore extracted directly from each review’s table
of included study characteristics by a single overview author (LG),
and assessed as being low risk of bias when there was a minimum
of 50 participants per arm, or 100 in total. Numbers were then
separated for the proportion of studies with greater than 100 par-
ticipants per arm (or 200 in total), and 200 participants per arm
(or 400 in total), as this could then be considered higher tiered
evidence.
Only 26 out of 264 included studies (10%) across the 21 reviews
reported over 100 participants in total (or 50 per arm), a further
6% (15/264) included over 200 participants per arm. The remain-
ing 223 studies (84%) had fewer than 50 participants per arm (or
sample size was not reported), often not reaching 50 in total.
Other bias
The format for reporting bias has changed, and therefore some
earlier reviews (that are yet to be updated) did not assess bias using
the same format. Others reported additional criteria as ’other bias’
including the similarity of baseline characteristics, and similarity
of timing points.
Interpretation of results/conclusions by original
review authors
For conclusions made by the original review authors, see Table
8. We assessed whether these conclusions/interpretations of the
results accurately reflected the information provided within the
review, and if any further information should have been included.
This final assessment of the review is an important stage in deter-
mining any author bias within the review process, as many readers,
funders, and policy makers will focus on the author conclusions
without a full appraisal of the actual presented data.
Eleven of the 21 reviews reported appropriate conclusions based
on the data available in the context of the quality of evidence
(Bidonde 2014; Boldt 2014; Busch 2007; Busch 2013; Fransen
2015; Gross 2015a; Koopman 2015; Regnaux 2015; Saragiotto
2016; Silva 2010; Yamato 2015); five reviews had appropriate con-
clusions, did not mention quality of the evidence in the conclu-
sion, but did discuss it in detail earlier in the review (Bartels 2007;
Cramp 2013; Han 2004; Hayden 2005; Lauret 2014); two re-
views had appropriate conclusions but had only limited discussion
of quality or did not adequately consider the quality of the evi-
dence in the interpretation of the results (Hurkmans 2009; Lane
2014); and three reviews needed further comment as the strength
of the conclusions were not appropriate based on the available data
(Brown 2010; Fransen 2014), or we were unable to agree with
their interpretation due to difficulty in extracting the data (van
der Heijden 2015).
Effect of interventions
We have interpreted results using data reported in the reviews,
and did not return to the original studies. Where data have been
reported as MDs or as an absolute or relative change score we have
used the appropriate scales (where possible) to determine whether
this was clinically significant. When data have only been presented
as SMD, with or without 95% confidence intervals (CI), with or
without level of significance (P value), we have cautiously used the
interpretation by Cohen 1988 who defined effect size using the
SMD as small (SMD 0.2 to 0.5), moderate (SMD 0.5 to 0.8), or
large (SMD greater than 0.8).
For the purposes of clarity, we have used the term ’intervention’ to
refer to the exercise or physical activity intervention, and ’control’
to refer to the included comparison group which did not involve
any exercise or physical activity element.
Primary outcome
Self-reported pain (severity)
Part of the inclusion criteria for this overview was for pain severity
to be listed as an outcome measure.

Cochrane Collaboration.
 Two of the 21 reviews did not include/identify any studies that
examined intervention versus control (Lauret 2014; Silva 2010).
Of the remaining reviews that did report studies examining inter-
vention versus control (no physical activity or exercise, or minimal
intervention), two did not report pain as an absolute or relative
score of severity, intensity, or change as a result of the interven-
tion (Brown 2010; Han 2004), and one review assessed pain-free
time and distance during exercise (they did not assess pain using
a mean/usual pain scale; Lane 2014). We could not extract rele-
vant data for one review as they compared two different exercise
interventions and a control but did not report the data compared
to the control (Regnaux 2015).
The remaining 15 reviews reported a mean or usual pain score for
exercise (intervention) and no-exercise (control) groups (Bartels
2007; Bidonde 2014; Boldt 2014; Busch 2007; Busch 2013;
Cramp 2013; Fransen 2014; Fransen 2015; Gross 2015a; Hayden
2005; Hurkmans 2009; Koopman 2015; Saragiotto 2016; van der
Heijden 2015; Yamato 2015).
Reported baseline pain score
Of the 15 reviews that were able to assess pain (Table 9), only three
reviews reported actual baseline pain scores (Bidonde 2014; Boldt
2014; Hayden 2005). Three reviews reported change data (Bartels
2007; Busch 2007; Busch 2013), but we were able to use control
group baseline and earliest control group scores as assumed or
approximate baseline measures for the intervention groups in nine
reviews (Bartels 2007; Busch 2007; Fransen 2014; Fransen 2015;
Gross 2015a; Koopman 2015; Saragiotto 2016; van der Heijden
2015; Yamato 2015). Overall, only three reviews that assessed pain
did not provide baseline or control group scores for comparison
(Busch 2013; Cramp 2013; Hurkmans 2009).

of 0 (no pain) to 150 (worst pain ever)
This suggests the majority of participants reviewed had mild-to-
moderate pain (only one review reported a mean of severe pain
(aquatic exercise for fibromyalgia, Bidonde 2014) at the com-
mencement of each intervention (less than 30/100 mild pain, 30/
100 to 60/100 moderate pain, more than 60/100 severe pain;
Collins 1997), though labelling the majority as having only mild-
to-moderate pain should be interpreted with caution due to the
lack of specific data available - the baseline data of the intervention
group would have been preferable to the proxies we have had to
use.
Quality judgement/ tiered quality (first, second, third tier
evidence)
Our assessment criteria stated that we would accept the informa-
tion as graded evidence when reported as the number of partic-
ipants achieving a 50% (first tier evidence) or 30% (second tier
evidence) reduction in pain, but none of the included reviews re-
ported results in this way, and so instead we used the reported
absolute and relative change values.
None of the included reviews fulfilled the requirements for first
tier evidence (at least 50% pain reduction from baseline, study
duration longer than eight weeks, and more than 200 participants
per arm).
Second tier evidence (at least 30% pain reduction from baseline,
study duration between four and eight weeks, and more than 200
participants in total or 100 participants per arm) was also lacking
in these reviews; three reviews found at least 30% reduction in
pain from baseline (Busch 2007; Busch 2013; van der Heijden
2015), one of which also used long enough exercise programmes
(eight to 21 weeks’ intervention, Busch 2013) but totalled only
81 participants across two studies. The other two reviews did not
fulfil the study duration criteria (interventions from 2.5 weeks,
Busch 2007; and three weeks, van der Heijden 2015) or study size
criteria.
Consequently results from relevant reviews have been pooled (all
tier three quality) where appropriate, though results should be
interpreted with caution due to the low quality evidence.
Treatment effect
Data that could be extracted for pain can be seen in Table 9 for
all reviews. Only three reviews found no statistically significant
changes in usual or mean pain from any intervention (Cramp
2013; Hurkmans 2009; Koopman 2015 (assumed due to lack of
presented data)). The remaining reviews reported a statistically
significant effect of the intervention at one or more time points,
in at least one subgroup.
Three reviews found at least 30% pain reduction from baseline
(post-intervention - strength training: Busch 2007; Busch 2013, at
short-term follow-up: van der Heijden 2015). Additionally, seven
reviews reported clinically significant results (minimally important
difference: reduction in pain from baseline of at least 10 points on a
0 to 100 scale or an absolute improvement of at least 10% to 20%,
Dworkin 2008)asaresultof the exercise intervention(1.3/10from
aerobic training, Busch 2007; 12/100 (95% CI 10 to 15), Fransen
2015,; 14.9/100 (95% CI 7.39 to 22.40), Gross 2015a; 10.2/100
(95% CI 1.31 to 19.09), Hayden 2005; 2.5/10 (95% CI 1.52 to
3.48), Boldt 2014; 10.01/100 (95% CI 4.35 to 15.67), Saragiotto
2016; 14.05/100 (95% CI 9.19 to 18.91), Yamato 2015). Three
reviews found statistically significant improvements as a result of
the intervention, but they did not reach clinical significance (post-
intervention, P = 0.02, Bartels 2007; “small to moderate” benefit
post-intervention and at six-month follow-up, P < 0.001, Fransen
2014; “moderate effect” of 7% (95% CI 3 to 11) benefit post-
intervention, Bidonde 2014).
Overall, results were inconsistent across interventions and follow-
up (see Table 9), as exercise did not consistently bring about a
change (positive or negative) in self-reported pain scores at any
single point.
Secondary outcomes
Physical function (objectively or subjectively measured)
Measures of physical function were the primary outcome measure
in eight out of 21 reviews (Busch 2013; Han 2004; Hayden 2005;
Hurkmans 2009; Koopman 2015; Lane 2014; Lauret 2014; Silva
2010), and a reported (non-primary) outcome measure in nine
more reviews (Bartels 2007; Bidonde 2014; Busch 2007; Fransen
2014; Fransen 2015; Gross 2015a; Regnaux 2015; Saragiotto
2016; van der Heijden 2015, plus some which assessed disability;
Cramp 2013; Saragiotto 2016; Yamato 2015). Only Boldt 2014
and Brown 2010 did not list physical function (or disability, or
activity limitation) as a potential outcome measure.
Treatment effect
Data that could be extracted for physical function are shown in
Table 10. Two reviews which reported physical function had no

 data to extract (Lauret 2014; Silva 2010), and for one review we
were unable to extract the relevant data (Regnaux 2015). Two
reviews found no significant difference in physical function be-
tween the intervention and control groups (Han 2004; Hurkmans
2009, both rheumatoid arthritis, 8 studies, n = 240). The remain-
ing 14 reviews showed that the intervention produced a statis-
tically significant benefit over the control at a minimum of one
reported time point (Bartels 2007; Bidonde 2014; Busch 2007;
Busch 2013; Cramp 2013; Fransen 2014; Fransen 2015; Gross
2015a; Hayden 2005; Koopman 2015; Lane 2014; Saragiotto
2016; van der Heijden 2015; Yamato 2015; 129 studies, n greater
than 9559 (exact number unknown due to some participant num-
bers not being reported)).
Many of these statistically significant results were of small or mod-
erate effect size (as reported by the review authors, or using the
definition by Cohen 1988 if unreported; small effect size: Bartels
2007; Bidonde 2014; Fransen 2014; Fransen 2015; Gross 2015a;
Koopman 2015; Saragiotto 2016; Yamato 2015, moderate effect
size: Busch 2007; Fransen 2015; Yamato 2015).
Only one review reported statistical significance and large effect
size (both short-term and long-term follow-up: SMD 1.10 (95%
CI 0.58 to 1.63) and 1.62 (95% CI 0.31 to 2.94), van der Heijden
2015). However, the original review authors highlighted the low
to very low quality of the evidence as many studies had high or
unclear risk of bias across multiple domains (van der Heijden
2015).
Psychological function
Only five out of 21 reviews assessed psychological function as
mental health (Bartels 2007; Bidonde 2014; Busch 2013), anxiety
(Cramp 2013), and depression (Boldt 2014; Busch 2013; Cramp
2013).
Treatment effect
Data that could be extracted for psychological function can be
seen in Table 11. There were significant effects in favour of the in-
tervention for mental health (Bartels 2007) and depression (Busch
2013) scores, and “variable effect” for depression (Cramp 2013).
However, there was also no effect or no differences between con-
trol and intervention groups reported for mental health (Bidonde
2014; Busch 2013), anxiety (Cramp 2013), and depression (Boldt
2014).
Quality of life
A version of quality of life assessment was reported in nine reviews.
Six were termed quality of life or health-related quality of life
(HRQoL) (Bartels 2007; Boldt 2014; Fransen 2014; Fransen
2015; Gross 2015a; Lauret 2014).
Other reviews assessed global perceived effect (Gross 2015a),
global wellbeing (Busch 2007), global assessment (Hayden 2005),
global impression of recovery (Saragiotto 2016; Yamato 2015),
health assessment questionnaire (Silva 2010), multi-dimensional
function (Bidonde 2014; Busch 2013), and work status (Hayden
2005). These have been reported separately to quality of life (Table
12).
Treatment effect
Data that could be extracted for quality of life can be seen in
Table 12. Four reviews found no significant difference between
intervention and control groups in health-related quality of life
post-intervention (9 studies, n = 556) (HRQoL: Boldt 2014;
Fransen 2014; Gross 2015a, global assessment: Bidonde 2014;
Gross 2015a)), three reviews did not or were unable to report
any data (HRQoL: Lauret 2014, global assessment: Hayden 2005,
other assessment: Silva 2010), and seven reviews found a signifi-
cant improvement as a result of the intervention (34 studies, n =
2700) (HRQoL: Bartels 2007, Fransen 2015, global assessment:
Busch 2007; Saragiotto 2016; Yamato 2015, other assessment:
Bidonde 2014; Busch 2013).
Two reviews assessing strength/resistance training interventions
found significantly large effect sizes (SMD greater than 0.8, as
defined by Cohen 1988) in favour of the intervention (global
wellbeing measure, SMD 1.43 (95% CI 0.76 to 2.10), Busch
2007; Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, SMD 1.27 (95% CI
0.72 to 1.83), Busch 2013). Other statistically significant changes
reported in the included reviews were of small-to-moderate effect
size (SMD 0.2 to 0.8, Cohen 1988).
Adherence to the prescribed intervention
Only one review reported adherence to the intervention as an out-
come measure (Regnaux 2015), but the authors were unable to
perform an analysis on attendance as most studies did not clearly
report attendance or compliance (Regnaux 2015). However, five
reviews assessed withdrawals or dropouts (Bidonde 2014; Fransen
2014; Han 2004; Regnaux 2015; Saragiotto 2016), one reported
all-cause attrition (Busch 2013), and another reported the discon-
tinuation rate (Silva 2010).
Data that could be extracted for adherence, withdrawals, and at-
trition can be seen in Table 13. Pooling all available data for with-
drawals/dropout/attrition gave an RR of 1.02 (95% CI 0.94 to
1.12) in favour of the control group (6 reviews, 30 studies, n =
2256, control withdrawal 81/1000, intervention withdrawal 82.8/
1000).
One clinically controlled trial (CCT) in one review reported sta-
tistically significant improvement in enjoyment of exercise/rest (P
= 0.0002) and self-reported benefit from exercise/rest (P = 0.006)
at both post-intervention (end of therapy, 10 weeks) and follow-
up (four months later) (n = 95, Han 2004).

Cochrane Collaboration.
 Healthcare use/attendance
None of the reviews reported healthcare use/attendance.
Adverse events (not death)
Eighteen out of 21 reviews reported adverse effects (three reviews
did not report adverse events as an outcome measure due to lack
of studies or other undisclosed reasons; Brown 2010; Lauret 2014;
Silva 2010). Two reviews only assessed a specific adverse event
(“amputation” Lane 2014; “motor unit survival” Koopman 2015),
one review observed “safety - pain and radiological damage” (
Hurkmans 2009), and another referred to any “side-effects” (Han
2004).
Data that could be extracted for adverse events (not death) can be
seen in Table 14. The total number of reported adverse events (not
death) was 137 events across 39 studies out of 61 studies that had
adverse events as an outcome measure (over one-third of all trials
that reported them found no adverse events related to the inter-
vention): six reviews reported no adverse events from the included
trials (Bartels 2007; Busch 2013; Cramp 2013; Hurkmans 2009;
Koopman 2015; Yamato 2015) though the authors questioned
whether this was due to lack of reporting by the trial authors, or
whether there were no adverse events.
Adverse events were largely reported as a total number per trial,
though one review separately reported results for the intervention
group versus the control group (Saragiotto 2016), and two oth-
ers reported adverse events for the intervention group only (Boldt
2014; Regnaux 2015). Only one review calculated an RR for the
adverse events, showing a reduced risk for amputation in the inter-
vention group (two amputations in the usual care/control group:
RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.15, based on one study in one review,
Lane 2014).
Death
Only one out of 21 reviews reported death separately to other
adverse events(Lane 2014). Basedonfive studieswithinthe review,
death had an RR of 0.71 (95% CI 0.28 to 1.78) in favour of
exercise as being protective, though was not statistically significant
(P = 0.47).
D I S C U S S I O N
Specificity of the condition: despite the heterogeneous nature of
chronic pain, in this overview we have combined several painful
conditions covering a number of conditions and diagnoses. Re-
gardless of aetiology, the impact of chronic pain is broadly similar
across many conditions.
Summary of main results
Pain severity: there were favourable results in a number of reviews
as a result of exercise: only three reviews found no statistically
significant changes in usual or mean pain from any intervention.
However, resultswere inconsistentacrossinterventionsandfollow-
up, as the intervention did not consistently bring about a change
(positive or negative) in self-reported pain scores at any single
point. The exercise or physical activity interventions did not have a
negative effect on the outcome (did not worsen the pain). A factor
in the lack of statistical and clinically significant result may be the
baseline pain severity of participants. The majority of the included
population had an assumed mild-to-moderate pain severity score
(assumed only due to lack of exact group data at baseline). This
is often the desired outcome (post-intervention) of many drug
therapies for pain, and it may therefore be difficult to show a
clinically significant improvement in these people.
Physical function: physical function/disability was the most com-
monly reported outcome measure, and was the primary measure
in eight out of the 21 reviews. Physical function was significantly
(statistically) improved as a result of the intervention in 14 reviews,
though even these statistically significant results had only small-
to-moderate effect sizes in all but one review.
Psychological function and quality of life: there were variable
results for psychological function and quality of life: results were
either favourable to exercise (two reviews reporting significantly
large effect sizes for quality of life), or showed no difference be-
tween groups. There were no negative effects.
Adherence to the prescribed intervention: could not be assessed
in any included review. However, risk of withdrawal/dropout was
slightly higher in the exercising group (82.8/1000 participants
versus 81/1000 participants), though the group difference was not
significant.
Healthcare use/attendance: not reported in any included review.
Adverse events, potential harm, and death: importantly, exercise
caused no actual harm, with most adverse events being increased
soreness or muscle pain, which reportedly subsided after several
weeks of the intervention. One review reported a non-significant
reduction in risk of death as a result of the intervention.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Of the 21 included reviews, seven could be considered out of
date as they were most recently assessed as up-to-date prior to
2010 such that any recent controlled trials assessing pain severity
have not been included in this overview (Cochrane recommends
updating reviews every two years) (Bartels 2007; Brown 2010;
Busch 2007; Han 2004; Hayden 2005; Hurkmans 2009; Silva
2010). We includedthese reviewsinthe overview, buttheymaynot
be as relevant now due to the elapsed time since they were updated.
One protocol that had potential to be included was published in

Cochrane Collaboration.
 2006 with no full review available yet (Craane 2006).
Available data suggest that participants in the included reviews and
studies would generally be characterised as having mild-moderate
pain (moderate greater than 30/100 or 3/10) with only one review
reporting moderate-severe pain (severe greater than 60/100 or 6/
10). Therefore whether the evidence of change or no change seen
here as a result of each intervention is applicable to people further
along on the pain spectrum (with higher pain scores/worse pain)
is debatable. However, it can be argued that those people are more
likely to be assigned medical or surgical interventions than physical
activity and exercise alone (where available), and as a group they
may be less able to engage in exercise, and may therefore be more
difficult to recruit into exercise-only studies. Having said this,
the labelling of participants as having mild-moderate pain was
a cautious one within this overview due to the lack of specific
data available at baseline assessment; only three reviews included
baseline pain scores in the intervention group, and two further
reviews provided control group baseline scores.
There are still gaps in the available literature, and therefore also
within this overview. None of the included reviews examined gen-
eralised or widespread chronic pain as a global condition, each in-
stead examined specific conditions that included chronic pain as a
symptom or result of the ongoing condition (rheumatoid arthri-
tis, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, low back pain, intermittent clau-
dication, dysmenorrhoea, mechanical neck disorder, spinal cord
injury, postpolio syndrome, and patellofemoral pain). The pain
in these cases can occur secondary to other symptoms such as fa-
tigue, muscle stiffness, difficulty sleeping, and depression, all of
which could separately (and more effectively) be influenced by the
intervention. Additionally, only 25% of included studies actively
reported adverse events. This may affect the completeness of the
evidence as conclusions have been drawn based on the available
data. The included reviews did not discuss the possible impact
of this non-reporting by the original trials, and this may lead to
underestimating possible adverse events from an intervention, or
overestimating its safety.
The exercise interventions examined in the included reviews were
broad; including aerobic, strength, flexibility, range of motion,
and core or balance training programmes, as well as yoga, Pilates,
and tai chi. Many of these interventions can be accessed in the
community by the general public and people with chronic pain,
either individually or in classes (yoga, Pilates, tai chi). Other exer-
cise intervention programmes, such as the motor control exercise
and proprioceptive (balance) training, requires at least initial su-
pervision by a therapist to teach the correct techniques and pro-
vide feedback for progression.
Quality of the evidence
In assessing the quality of the evidence, we employed the AM-
STAR tool to examine the reviews, extracted data on risk of bias
to examine the available primary evidence, and evaluated the au-
thors’ conclusions to ensure that they were appropriate based on
the available data.
The AMSTAR tool is useful in assessing the reporting of a system-
atic review, though it does not inform us of the actual undertaking
or conduct of the review process. All 21 included reviews scored
well across the AMSTAR assessment, though this is likely due to
the stringent reporting guidelines implemented by Cochrane prior
to publication. However, it may be necessary or advisable for the
Cochrane guidelines to be further expanded and detailed with re-
gards to reporting study characteristics, publication bias, and con-
flicts of interest, as these areas often did not meet the requirements
laid out in the AMSTAR criteria (Table 1).
Data extracted from the reviews regarding their assessment of bias
(risk of bias) showed moderate level scores at best across all in-
cluded studies within the included reviews. Other than issues sur-
rounding blinding (which are problematic in exercise intervention
studies due to the nature of the intervention), the trials did not
consistently and adequately report potential attrition and report-
ing biases, with less than half of studies within these reviews at low
risk of bias.
However, the most prominent issue with regards to bias in these
exercise and physical activity intervention studies is the sample
size used. This subcategory is not used as standard in the assess-
ment of bias in Cochrane Reviews, despite the increasing volume
of research available suggesting that small studies of fewer than
100 participants per arm (Moore 2010; Nüesch 2010) are at in-
creased risk of succumbing to the random effects in estimating
both direction and magnitude of treatment effects (Moore 1998;
Turner 2013) due to greater heterogeneity within and between
small studies (IntHout 2015).
Studies within the included reviews here were very small (often
fewer than 50 participants in total). For greater quality and a more
reliable effect, at least 100 participants per arm should be analysed
for a study to potentially be classed as tier two evidence (200 per
arm for tier one); small studies are known to overestimate the
treatment effect by up to 32% in comparison with larger studies
(Deschartes 2013).
Assessing studies for risk of bias based on study size (total num-
ber or per arm) should be included in any review or meta-analy-
sis in future, to adequately assess the influence of small trials on
the estimated treatment effect (Nüesch 2010). Inclusion in the
standard assessment process may in turn influence the design and
undertaking of future research trials to increase the sample size,
and produce more consistent clinically and statistically accurate
results.
Of the 21 included reviews, 12 used a pain measure as their pri-
mary outcome (Bartels 2007; Boldt 2014; Brown 2010; Busch
2007; Fransen 2014; Fransen 2015; Gross 2015a; Hayden 2005;
Regnaux 2015; Saragiotto 2016; van der Heijden 2015; Yamato
2015), and the remaining nine reviews included the measure as a
secondary outcome only. Other outcomes were shared, including
physical and psychological function, and quality of life. Likewise,

Cochrane Collaboration.
 each review team will have included studies that did not use their
chosen outcome measures as the primary measure, and that were
therefore powered according to a different primary outcome. On
collating the evidence, some studies may appear underpowered
for the outcome(s) of interest to us (Turner 2013), yet were ade-
quately powered for the studies’ primary measure. To increase the
power of the results of this overview, and the intermediary reviews
we have included, intervention studies that focus on painful con-
ditions should include pain intensity as the primary outcome, or
at least as a prominent secondary outcome; alternatively review
authors should seek to include only those studies that were ade-
quately powered for pain intensity as a primary outcome measure.
Intervention length ranged from a single session to regular sessions
over a period of 30 months, though the majority were between
eight and 12 weeks. Durations of this length are common among
exercise andphysical activityinterventionstudiestoallowforphys-
iological adaptation and familiarisation. In contrast, the follow-up
period was often inadequate, as many reviews reported only a sin-
gle follow-up point (immediately post-intervention), or repeated
measures over the short-term (less than six months): only six of
the 21 reviews planned to assess participants over the long term
(over 12 months: Gross 2015a; Hayden 2005; Hurkmans 2009;
Regnaux 2015; Saragiotto 2016; van der Heijden 2015). With
chronic conditions, it would be advisable to include longer follow-
up periods (beyond 12 months post-randomisation) as long-term
solutions may be more relevant to their control or pain manage-
ment. It is also possible that initial adaptation and potential bene-
fits as a result of an exercise intervention may take longer to man-
ifest in comparison to a ’healthy’ person due to the possible limi-
tations in exercise intensity and progression (a training threshold)
beyond which any additional physical training may be detrimental
to the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms (Daenen 2015)
or simply be additional physical stress with no additional physical
benefit (Benton 2011).
We grouped outcome measurement points in this overview into
short term (less than six months), intermediate term (six to 12
months), and long term (longer than 12 months). The broad time
window for ’short term’ outcomes (less than six months) is a po-
tential source of heterogeneity as the early period is the one where
time of measurement is most likely to result in variable outcomes.
These initial problems could be overcome by use of standard re-
porting periods in exercise intervention studies (suggested four-
weekly within the ’short term’ period to assess both neural adap-
tation and other physiological changes). This would allow review
authors to use the data gathered closest to the time point they are
assessing, for more accurate analyses. Additionally, by extending
the follow-up period beyond one year (long-term follow-up), het-
erogeneity may be reduced further.
Reviews generally did not enforce a minimum exercise require-
ment for inclusion in their review. Additionally, not all exercise
sessions were supervised or baseline fitness/physical ability was as-
sessed subjectively, and consequently it was not reported whether
the intervention was fulfilled as described, or whether the dose
was enough to elicit a physiological response. Studies often rely
on the self-report of participants as to the actual physical activity
and exercise being undertaken, which can lead to a greater risk of
bias, and reduced study quality as it is questionable as to whether
the effect can be truly attributed to the intervention. This was
examined in a previous review, where it was concluded that non-
subjective physical assessment should be performed where possible
(Perruchoud 2014), though these still have challenges regarding
implementation.
In summary, the quality of the evidence was low (third tier): within
this overview we found no tier one or tier two evidence. This is
largely due to the small sample sizes and potentially underpowered
studies. A number of studies within the reviews had adequately
long interventions, but planned follow-up was limited to less than
one year (12 months) in all but six reviews.
Interpretation of the available data, and conclusions drawn by the
review authors, were appropriate, although the conclusions were
sometimes stronger than warranted by the available data. Occa-
sionally results were not discussed with regards to the quality of
the evidence or risk of bias: it is important to discuss the findings
in the context of the quality of the evidence, with complete trans-
parency, as this may affect future research, and implications for
patients, funders, and policy makers.
Potential biases in the overview process
While we have attempted to include all relevant reviews in the
overview process, we do concede that by only searching the
Cochrane Library, and including only current Cochrane Reviews
we may have missed some key literature. However previous publi-
cations have referred to the higher quality grading (high AMSTAR
score) in Cochrane Reviews due to the basic criteria necessary for
publication at any stage (protocol or full review) suggesting they
may be the most reliable source of evidence (O’Connell 2013).

 low quality (tier three). Promisingly however, none of the physical
and activity interventions assessed appeared to cause harm to the
participants.
Implications for practice
For clinicians and people with chronic pain
The evidence in this overview suggests that the broad spectrum of
physical activity and exercise interventions assessed here (aerobic,
strength, flexibility, range of motion, and core or balance training
programmes, as well as yoga, Pilates, and tai chi) are potentially
beneficial, though the evidence for benefit is low quality and in-
consistent. The most commonly reported adverse events were in-
creased soreness or muscle pain, which subsided after several weeks
of the intervention.
Physical activity and exercise may improve pain severity as well as
physical function and quality of life.
For policy makers
The evidence showed variable results, though in some reviews
there was a clinical and statistical benefit in pain relief and physical
function (based on low quality evidence). The evidence suggests
that physical activity or exercise is an acceptable intervention in
people with chronic pain, with minimal negative adverse effects.
However based on this low quality evidence, we cannot provide
directiontothe contentof anexercise programme shouldclinicians
decide to implement one.
Implications for research
There is a clear need for further research into exercise and physical
activity for chronic pain in adults.
General implications
• Future research should report baseline values for outcome
measures in both intervention and control groups, together with
detailed relevant information about the participants. Knowing
the baseline value is relevant to interpreting any change observed
as a result of the intervention, and understanding the broader
value of the intervention.
• Where possible, pain results should be reported as the
number of people achieving 50%, 30%, and 10% pain relief,
and the number who did not meet that point (dichotomous
outcome). These are clinically important cut-offs in pain
intervention research, and reporting in this way allows readers to
observe the clinical effect more effectively.
• Reporting should include median and range as well as mean
and standard deviation (SD) of results. This will allow readers to
review the effects of any outliers that may have skewed the data,
which often goes unnoticed in the reporting of mean and SD
alone.
• The importance of clear intervention reporting is
underestimated: often studies report both intervention and
control programmes simply, where other researchers and
clinicians alike are unable to replicate the trial or intervention.
Recommendations for reporting are based on the Consolidated
Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement (
www.consort-statement.org/), but this alone does not detail the
extent of necessary intervention and control programmes
reporting. The template for intervention description and
replication (TIDieR) approach (Hoffman 2014) is intended as
an extension to CONSORT item 5 (“The interventions for each
group with sufficient details to allow replication, including how
and when they were actually administered”) and is a checklist for
detailing the programmes using: why (rationale), what (materials
and procedures), who, how, where, when, and how much.
Design
• One previous review highlighted the increased bias often
present in questionnaires and other self-report measures of
physical activity in people with chronic pain, and as a result
made the recommendation to use objective measures instead,
such as accelerometers, or the use of direct and indirect
calorimetry, where possible (Perruchoud 2014), though these
still have challenges regarding implementation. This would allow
direct and exact comparison and analyses of actual energy
expenditure and treatment effect.
Population/participants/sample
• There needs to be a focus on participants with generalised
and/or widespread chronic pain, instead of (or as well as)
condition-specific populations.
• Studies should include people with higher pain severity
(greater than 50/100 on a 100-point visual analogue scale) at
baseline. People with mild-moderate pain should still be
included, but it would be advisable to separate the results for
analysis, ensuring the study is adequately powered to allow this
subgroup analysis in advance. This way we could determine if
exercise has benefit overall, or affects one group more than
another, and tailor exercise programmes according to the
individual needs.
• It has been previously suggested that for 20% to 25% of
participants undertaking an exercise programme there is little to
no favourable response (Timmons 2014), while a small
percentage (5% to 10%) have adverse events (Bouchard 2012). It
is therefore vitally important that much larger sample sizes are
used: ideally more than 200 participants per arm, though even this
number in total would increase the quality of the evidence in the
20

 first instance. In this way we may be able to learn to identify
individuals who will benefit, and those who will require further
intervention.
Interventions
• Different forms of exercise should be researched in detail.
For the purposes of this overview, we combined all physical
activity and exercise interventions under one banner to
determine if there was any effect. However a number of reviews
separately analysed resistance (strength) training, aerobic
(endurance), and combination programmes. It is important to
continue to examine different modalities, but currently there is
not enough high quality evidence to exclude or prioritise one
specific mode (resistance, endurance, stability) or medium (land/
water based), or the proportion of a combination programme to
be assigned to each, as all may have individual benefits for people
with chronic pain.
• Intensity of exercise, duration of individual sessions, and
frequency should be investigated. It is this dose alongside
duration (of the entire intervention) and adherence that may
determine the actual efficacy.
• More reviews and trials should attempt to minimise
intervention heterogeneity by implementing minimum and
maximum requirements. Only this way will the research
community be able to determine more accurately the direction
and magnitude of effect of a specific programme or intervention.
Many of these important restrictions can be implemented as
subgroup analyses, though if this is the case it is important to
have adequate study numbers (ideally 200 participants per arm
or subgroup).
• Due to the chronicity and long-term nature of the
condition, physiological and psychological changes may take
longer to manifest. It is widely accepted that there is a delay in
muscular hypertrophy as a result of exercise, and initial gains
within the first few weeks of any training programme will be as a
result of neural factors (Enoka 1997); this is also in line with the
grading of evidence (tier two evidence or higher requires a
minimum of a four-week intervention). This suggests that longer
interventions may be necessary (eight weeks for tier one
evidence), though assessing participants at regular intervals,
including at four weeks, would be beneficial to examine the
effect of the neural adaptation alone.
Measurement (end-points)
• Randomised controlled trials with long-term follow-up are
needed. Chronic pain is defined by its chronic nature, and
therefore long-term follow-up of results is equally important as
the initial short-term effect (if not more so): outcomes should be
assessed beyond one year after randomisation. In turn this will
inform the direct effect of the intervention, as well as the
proportion of the population who maintains the programme of
exercise employed in the intervention, or something else under
the guise of physical activity as a result of participation.
• The broad time window for ’short term’ outcomes (less than
six months) is a potential source of heterogeneity as the early
period is the one where time of measurement is most likely to
result in variable outcomes. These initial problems could be
overcome by use of standard reporting periods in exercise
intervention studies (suggested four-weekly assessment within
the ’short term’ period to assess both neural adaptation and other
physiological changes). This would allow review authors to use
the data recorded closest to the time point they are assessing, for
more accurate and comparable analyses.
• Outcome measures used by researchers should be
standardised across trials and studies. Recommendations for
selecting the most appropriate and important outcome measures
to those who live with chronic pain have previously been
published (Initiatives on Methods, Measurement, and Pain
Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) Consensus
Recommendations, Dworkin 2005; Turk 2003).
Other
• It would be of interest in future research to determine the
reasons for non-participation in regular physical activity or non-
compliance to a prescribed exercise intervention in people with
chronic pain, and how to overcome these barriers.
• Future Cochrane Reviews could include: exercise for
chronic pain or chronic widespread pain (and not specific
conditions such as osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, etc.), and exercise
for neuropathic pain. These areas have not been covered by
Cochrane with an exercise or physical activity intervention.

Table 1. AMSTAR tool to assess the methodological quality of systematic reviews
Criteria
Specific requirements (possible answers: yes, no, cannot an-
swer, not applicable)
1. Was an ’a priori’ design used?
The research question and inclusion criteria should be established
before the conduct of the review
Note: need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or predetermined/a
priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”
2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
There should be at least 2 independent data extractors and a con-
sensus procedure for disagreements should be in place
Note:2peopledostudyselection, 2peopledodataextraction, consensus
process or 1 person checks the other person’s work.
3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
At least 2 electronic sources should be searched. The report must
include years and databases used (e.g. CENTRAL, MEDLINE,
and Embase). Keywords or MeSH terms (or both) must be stated
and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All
searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents,
reviews, textbooks, specialised registers, or experts in the particular
field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found
Note: if at least 2 sources + 1 supplementary strategy used, select “yes”
(Cochrane register/ CENTRAL counts as 2 sources; a grey literature

search counts as supplementary).
4. Was the status of the publication (i.e. grey literature) used as
inclusion criteria?
The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless
of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not
they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on
their publication status, language, etc
Note: if review indicates that there was a search for “grey litera-
ture”or “unpublished literature,”indicate “yes.”SIGLE database, dis-
sertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered
grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and
non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished
literature.
5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
A list of included and excluded studies should be provided.
Note: acceptable if the excluded studies were referenced. If there was
an electronic link to the list but the link is no longer active, select “no.
”
6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original
studies should be provided on the participants, interventions, and
outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analysed,
e.g. age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status,
duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported
Note: acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as
above.
7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and
documented?
’A priori’ methods of assessment should be provided (e.g. for effec-
tiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomised,
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, or allocation conceal-
ment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative
items will be relevant
Note: can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g. Jadad
scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality
items, with some type of result for EACH study (“low”or “high”is
acceptable, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low”and which
scored “high;”a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).
8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appro-
priately in formulating conclusions?
The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality
should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the
review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations
Note: might say something such as “the results should be interpreted
with caution due to poor quality of included studies.”Cannot score
“yes”for this question if scored “no”for question 7.
9. Were the methods used to combine findings of studies appro-
priate?
For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies
were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e. Chi2 test for
homogeneity, I2 statistic). If heterogeneity exists, a random-effects
model should be used or the clinical appropriateness of combining
should be taken into consideration (i.e. is it sensible to combine?

), or both
Note: indicate “yes”if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e. if
they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability
between interventions.
10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of
graphical aids (e.g. funnel plot, other available tests) or statistical
tests (e.g. Egger regression test), or both
Note: if no test values or funnel plot included, score “no.”Score “yes”if
they mention that publication bias could not be assessed because there
were fewer than 10 included studies.
11. Was the conflict of interest stated?
Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in
both the systematic review and the included studies
Note: to get a “yes,”must indicate source of funding or support for the
systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

Review authors’ conclusions
Overview authors’ assessment of conclusions
Bartels 2007
“Aquatic exercise has some short-term beneficial ef-
fects on the condition of OA patients with hip or
knee OA or both. The controlled and randomised
studies in this area are still too few to give further
recommendations on how to use this therapy... No
long-term effects have been found.”
Appropriate conclusions based on available data. No
mention of quality/risk of bias in conclusions, though
found to be high quality in results section
Bidonde 2014
“Low to moderate quality evidence relative to control
suggests that aquatic training is beneficial for improv-
ing wellness, symptoms, and fitness in adults with fi-
bromyalgia. Very low to low quality evidence suggests
that there are benefits of aquatic and land-based exer-
cise, except in muscle strength (very low quality evi-
dence favoring land). No serious adverse effects were
reported.”
Appropriate conclusions based on available data.
Boldt 2014
“Evidence is insufficient to suggest that non-pharma-
cological treatments are effective in reducing chronic
pain in people living with SCI. The benefits and
harms of commonly used non-pharmacological pain
treatments should be investigated in randomised con-
trolled trials with adequate sample size and study
methodology”
Appropriate conclusions based on available data.
Brown 2010
“There is a lack of available evidence to support the
use of exercise in the alleviation of symptoms associ-
ated with dysmenorrhoea. The limited evidence im-
plies that there are no adverse effects associated with
exercise.”
Review authors should not have commented on lack
of adverse events as this was not reported in the in-
cluded study. The comment on lack of adverse events
contravened present Cochrane guidance
Busch 2007
“There is moderate quality evidence that short-term
aerobic training (at the intensity recommended for
increases in cardiorespiratory fitness) produces im-
portant benefits in people with FM in global out-
come measures, physical function, and possibly pain
and tender points. There is limited evidence that
strength training improves a number of outcomes
including pain, global wellbeing, physical function,
tender points and depression. There is insufficient
evidence regarding the effects of flexibility exercise.
Adherence to many of the aerobic exercise interven-
tions described in the included studies was poor.”
Appropriate conclusions based on available data.
Busch 2013
“We have found evidence in outcomes representing
wellness, symptoms, and physical fitness favoring re-
sistance training over usual treatment and over flexi-
bility exercise, and favoring aerobic training over re-

sistance training. Despite large effect sizes for many
outcomes, the evidence has been decreased to low
quality based on small sample sizes, small number of
randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and the problems
with description of study methods in some of the in-
cluded studies.”
Cramp 2013
“There is some evidence that physical activity inter-
ventions ... may help to reduce fatigue in RA. How-
ever, the optimal parametersandcomponentsof these
interventions are not yet established.”
Appropriate conclusions based on available data.
However, no mention of quality/risk of bias of stud-
ies in conclusion despite low/unclear quality score in
results and discussion sections
No conclusions about effect on pain (insufficient
data).
Fransen 2014
“There is currently high-level evidence that land-
basedexercise will reduce hippain,andimprove phys-
ical function, among people with symptomatic hip
osteoarthritis.”
Evidence was good quality though sample sizes were
often small (i.e. it is debatable if this was high level
evidence as claimed by authors). Agree that results
demonstrate small but significant benefit from inter-
vention
Fransen 2015
“High-quality evidence suggests that land-based ther-
apeutic exercise provides benefit in terms of reduced
knee pain and quality of life and moderate-quality
evidence of improved physical function among peo-
ple with knee OA… Despite the lack of blinding we
did not downgrade the quality of evidence for risk of
performance or detection bias.”
Appropriate conclusions based on available data. May
have been generous with quality assessment but this
was stated in conclusions for transparency
Gross 2015a
“…there is still no high quality evidence and un-
certainty about the effectiveness of exercise for neck
pain… Moderate quality evidence supports the use
specific strengthening exercises as a part of routine
practice … Moderate quality evidence supports the
use of strengthening exercises, combined with en-
durance or stretching exercises may also yield simi-
lar beneficial results. However, low quality evidence
notes when only stretching or only endurance type
exercises … there may be minimal beneficial effects
for both neck pain and function.”
Appropriate conclusions based on available data.
Han 2004
“Tai chi appears to have no detrimental effects on
the disease activity of RA in terms of swollen/tender
joints and activities of daily living…tai chi appears to
be safe, since only 1 participant out of 121 withdrew
due to adverse effects and withdrawals were greater
in the control groups than the tai chi groups.”
Appropriate conclusions based on available data.
However, no mention of quality/risk of bias in con-
clusion despite very low quality score in results sec-
tion

strates that exercise therapy is effective at reducing

ies in conclusion despite low quality score in results
and discussion sections
Hurkmans 2009
“Short-term, land-based dynamic exercise programs
have a positive effect on aerobic capacity (aerobic ca-
pacity training whether or not combined with muscle
strength training) and muscle strength (aerobic ca-
pacity training combined with muscle strength train-
ing) immediately after the intervention, but not after
a follow-up period. Short-term, water-based dynamic
exercise programs have a positive effect on functional
abilityandaerobiccapacitydirectlyafterthe interven-
tion but it is unknown whether these effects are main-
tained after follow-up. Long-term, land-based dy-
namic exercise programs (aerobic capacity and mus-
cle strength training) have a positive effect on func-
tional ability, aerobic capacity, and muscle strength
immediately after the intervention but it is unknown
whether these effects are maintained after follow-up...
Based on the evidence, aerobic capacity training com-
bined with muscle strength training is recommended
for routine practice in patients with RA.”
Appropriate conclusions based on available data.
However, no mention of quality/risk of bias of stud-
ies in conclusion
No conclusions regarding pain severity.
Koopman 2015
“Data from two single trials suggested that muscle
strengthening of thumb muscles (very low-quality ev-
idence) ... are safe and beneficial for improving mus-
cle strength ... with unknown effects on activity lim-
itations.”
“We found evidence varying from very low quality to
high quality that ... rehabilitation in a warm or cold
climate are not beneficial in PPS.”
“Due to a lack of good-quality data and randomised
studies, it was impossible to draw definitive conclu-
sions about the effectiveness of interventions in peo-
ple with PPS.”
Appropriate conclusions based on available data.
Lane 2014
“… Exercise therapy should play an important part
in the care of selected patients with intermittent clau-
dication, to improve walking times and distances. Ef-
fects were demonstrated following three months of
supervised exercise although some programmes lasted
over one year.”
Appropriate conclusions based on available data.
However, no mention of quality/risk of bias of stud-
ies in conclusion
No conclusions regarding pain severity.
Lauret 2014
“There was no clear evidence of differences between
supervised walking exercise and alternative exercise
modes in improving the maximum and pain-free
walking distance of patients with intermittent clau-
dication…. The results indicate that alternative ex-

ercise modes may be useful when supervised walking
exercise is not an option for the patient.”
Regnaux 2015
“We found very low- to low-quality evidence for no
important clinical benefit of high-intensity compared
to low-intensity exercise programs in improving pain
and physical function in the short term.... The in-
cluded studies did not provide any justification for
the levels of intensity of exercise programs. No au-
thors reported evidence for the minimal and maximal
intensity that could be delivered.”
Appropriate conclusionsbasedonavailable data.This
overview has only used one study of the six included
as it alone included a control group, for which we
could not extract data as the control comparison was
not used in the analysis by the review authors
Saragiotto 2016
“There is very low to moderate quality evidence that
MCE has a clinically important effect compared with
a minimal intervention for chronic low back pain..
. As MCE appears to be a safe form of exercise and
none of the other types of exercise stands out, the
choice of exercise for chronic low back pain should
depend on patient or therapist preferences, therapist
training, costs and safety.”
Appropriate conclusions based on available data.
Silva 2010
“We were not able to provide any evidence to support
the application of balance exercises (proprioceptive
training) alone in patients with RA.”
Appropriate conclusions based on available data (no
included studies)
van der Heijden 2015
“This review has found very low quality but consis-
tent evidence that exercise therapy for patellofemoral
pain syndrome (PFPS) may result in clinically im-
portant reduction in pain and improvement in func-
tional ability.”
No subgroup analysis to differentiate between acute,
subacute, and chronic pain made it difficult to extract
appropriate data for this review
Yamato 2015
“No definite conclusions or recommendations can be
made as we did not find any high quality evidence
for any of the treatment comparisons, outcomes or
follow-up periods investigated. However, there is low
to moderate quality evidence that Pilates is more ef-
fective than minimal intervention in the short and
intermediate term as the benefits were consistent for
pain intensity and disability, with most of the effect
sizes being considered medium.”
Appropriate conclusions based on available data.
There was no subgroup analysis to differentiate be-
tween acute, subacute, and chronic pain made it dif-
ficult to extract appropriate data for this review (one
included study had subacute back pain (> 6 weeks),
all others were chronic back pain (> 12 weeks)) but
results are presented altogether as chronic pain
