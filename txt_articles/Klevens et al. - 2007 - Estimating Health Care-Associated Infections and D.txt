objective. The purpose of this study was to provide a national estimate of the 
number of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) and deaths in United States 
hospitals. 
Methods. No single source of nationally representative data on HAIs is cur-
rently available. The authors used a multi-step approach and three data 
sources. The main source of data was the National Nosocomial Infections 
Surveillance (NNIS) system, data from 1990–2002, conducted by the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention. Data from the National Hospital Discharge 
Survey (for 2002) and the American Hospital Association Survey (for 2000) were 
used to supplement NNIS data. The percentage of patients with an HAI whose 
death was determined to be caused or associated with the HAI from NNIS 
data was used to estimate the number of deaths.
Results. In 2002, the estimated number of HAIs in U.S. hospitals, adjusted to 
include federal facilities, was approximately 1.7 million: 33,269 HAIs among 
newborns in high-risk nurseries, 19,059 among newborns in well-baby nurser-
ies, 417,946 among adults and children in ICUs, and 1,266,851 among adults 
and children outside of ICUs. The estimated deaths associated with HAIs in 
U.S. hospitals were 98,987: of these, 35,967 were for pneumonia, 30,665 for 
bloodstream infections, 13,088 for urinary tract infections, 8,205 for surgical 
site infections, and 11,062 for infections of other sites. 
Conclusion. HAIs in hospitals are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality 
in the United States. The method described for estimating the number of HAIs 
makes the best use of existing data at the national level.

Public Health Reports / March–April 2007 / Volume 122
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a common 
cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States 
and are among the most common adverse events in 
healthcare.1 Recently, new emphasis on HAIs as a 
patient safety and public health problem has under-
scored the need for systematic HAI surveillance as part 
of a broad-based prevention and control strategy.2–4 
As of March 2006, seven states have implemented 
mandatory reporting of HAIs by hospitals and other 
states are considering similar legislative mandates.5 At 
the national level, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention’s (CDC) National Nosocomial Infections 
Surveillance (NNIS) system, which was started in 1970 
with 62 participating hospitals, expanded to over 300 
acute care hospitals in 42 states by 2000. The NNIS 
system provided data on HAIs and was voluntary and 
confidential;6 benchmark rates were published for 
inter-hospital comparison.7 CDC’s successor system 
to NNIS, the National Healthcare Safety Network 
(NHSN), is designed to facilitate participation by a 
larger number of hospitals and expand enrollment to 
other types of healthcare settings.8
Ideally, one source of HAI information would meet 
different needs for surveillance data. In practice, how-
ever, resource requirements and evolving needs and 
priorities have prompted more selective goal setting 
and surveillance efforts. The NNIS system reflects these 
changes. Comprehensive or “hospital-wide” surveil-
lance was performed by at least half of NNIS hospitals 
through 1991. This enabled national estimates of all 
HAIs in hospitals to be made directly from NNIS data. 
However, interest in hospital-wide surveillance waned 
as more efficient, targeted surveillance emerged and 
new emphasis was placed on surveillance of high-risk, 
high-volume areas of hospital practice.9 NNIS added 
more specific components (e.g., intensive care units) 
and discontinued hospital-wide surveillance in 1998. 
While more targeted surveillance yielded many ben-
efits for HAI prevention and control, the cessation of 
hospital-wide surveillance has complicated the task 
of estimating all HAIs in hospitals. Still, with the aid 
of historical NNIS data and data from other sources, 
we developed a multi-step approach to estimate the 
magnitude of HAIs and associated deaths in U.S. 
hospitals in 2002. The purposes of this article are to 
present national estimates of HAIs and to discuss the 
challenges and opportunities for improving national 
public health surveillance of HAIs. 
MEtHoDS 
Definitions
An HAI was defined as a localized or systemic condition 
that (1) results from an adverse reaction to the pres-
ence of an infectious agent(s) or its toxin(s), (2) that 
occurs during a hospital admission, (3) for which there 
is no evidence the infection was present or incubating 
at admission, and (4) meets body site-specific criteria.6 
Patient-days were defined as the total number of days 
that patients were in the hospital. 
Data sources
The National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) 
system. The NNIS system was a voluntary network of U.S. 
hospitals collaborating with CDC to monitor HAIs from 
1970–2005. Hospitals participating in NNIS provided 
acute care, had 100 or more beds, and a minimum of 
one full-time equivalent infection control practitioner 
for the first 100 occupied beds. Detailed methods of 
the NNIS system are described elsewhere.6 Hospitals 
participating in NNIS were not selected randomly and 
might not represent all acute care hospitals in the 
United States. We used data from 283 participating 
NNIS hospitals in 2002; these contributed 2.3 million 
patient-days of information from 678 intensive care 
units (ICUs).
National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS). The NHDS 
is an annual CDC probability survey of characteristics 
of inpatients discharged from nonfederal short-stay 
hospitals in the United States. Methods for NHDS have 
been described extensively.10,11 Briefly, survey sampling 
is conducted in three stages. First, the geographic 
area (e.g., counties) is sampled; second, hospitals are 
selected within those geographic areas; and third, 
patient discharges are sampled within selected hospi-
tals. Patient records are reviewed to collect information 
on characteristics of the patient (e.g., age, gender), pro-
cedures performed, diagnoses, and dates of admission 
and discharge. Patient-days are calculated by counting 
days from admission to discharge and summing the 
days for all patients during the year. In 2002, 445 hos-
pitals participated in the survey and provided data on a 
weighted 37.5 million discharges. Of these discharges, 
90% (33,726,611) were among adults and children and 
10% (3,789,310) were among newborns.
American Hospital Association (AHA) Survey. The AHA 
conducts an annual survey of hospitals and their char-
acteristics (e.g., number of beds, discharges, services, 
occupancy).12 Participation in the AHA survey does 
not require membership in the AHA. Admissions and

patient-day data are available for federal and nonfed-
eral hospitals. In 2000, there were 5,800 hospitals in the 
AHA survey representing 34.9 million admissions and 
236.4 million patient-days. Federal hospitals accounted 
for 13.2 million (5.6%) patient-days. 
Estimate of HAIs in hospitals 
To estimate infections, we created four subpopulations 
(newborns in high-risk nurseries, newborns in well-baby 
nurseries, adults and children in ICUs, and adults and 
children outside of ICUs) and grouped HAIs into five 
major sites (surgical site infections, bloodstream infec-
tions, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and other 
sites combined). 
Step 1. Estimate of HAI among newborns. We stratified 
patient-days from NHDS among newborns into days 
spent in the high-risk nursery or the well-baby nursery 
according to the distribution of patient-days for these 
two subpopulations in NNIS hospital-wide surveillance. 
Then we calculated infection rates by major site of 
infection for the high-risk nursery using 2002 NNIS 
data from the high-risk nursery component, and in 
the well-baby nursery by major site of infection from 
1990–1995 using NNIS hospital-wide surveillance data. 
Total infections were estimated by multiplying the 
number of NHDS patient-days by the corresponding 
NNIS infection rates for the high-risk nursery and 
well-baby nursery (number of patient-days 3 infection 
rate/patient-days 5 number of infections). 
Step 2. Estimate of HAI among adults and children in ICUs. 
From NHDS, we obtained total patient-days nationally 
for adults and children and stratified these into ICU 
days and days outside of the ICU. For ICU patients, 
we calculated HAI rates by using NNIS ICU data for 
each major site of infection (number of patient-days 
3 infection rate/patient-days 5 number of infections) 
(see Figure).
Step 3. Estimate of HAIs among hospitalized adults and 
children outside of ICUs. NNIS HAI rates outside of ICUs 
were likely underestimated from 1990 to 1995; there-
fore, we used a different method from those above to 
estimate HAIs among adults and children outside of 
ICUs. Specifically, we estimated the number of infec-
tions from a single major site and then used the distri-
bution percentage for that site from NNIS hospital-wide 
surveillance to extrapolate to the total number of HAIs 
in adults and children outside of ICUs. We chose the 
surgical site for our calculations because the number of 
surgical procedures is available for the U.S. population 
in the NHDS. We multiplied the number of surgical 
procedures in the NHDS by the surgical site infection 
rate from NNIS 2002 surveillance. From this estimate, 
we subtracted surgical site infections among newborns 
and among adults and children in ICUs, which yielded 
the total number of such infections among hospital-
ized adults and children outside of ICUs, i.e., 244,385. 
Surgical site infections accounted for 20% of all HAIs 
in NNIS hospital-wide surveillance; thus, we used that 
percentage to estimate the number of infections for 
other body sites (see Figure).
Step 4. Adjustment to include federal hospitals. Because 
NHDS does not include federal hospitals, we used 
AHA data to adjust the HAI estimate to reflect the 
burden of these infections in federal hospitals. To do 
this, we calculated an adjustment factor by which we 
multiplied the number of non-newborn patient-days 
and non-newborn infection estimates. The number of 
newborn patient-days in federal hospitals was minimal, 
so we did not adjust the newborn estimates. From the 
AHA survey of 2000, we took the number of patient-days 
in federal hospitals (11.6 million), added the number 
of nonfederal hospital patient-days among adults and 
children (192.4 million) and divided the sum by the 
nonfederal hospital patient-days among adults and 
children (192.4 million). The result was 1.06, which 
we used as a multiplier of the number of adult and 
children NHDS patient-days and infection estimates. 
The multiplier increased the number of HAI by 6%. 
Estimate of deaths 
When patients with an HAI die during hospitalization 
at participating NNIS facilities, infection control profes-
sionals make an assessment of the relationship of the 
HAI to the death and classify the relationship as causal, 
contributory, not related, or unknown. If a patient has 
multiple HAIs and dies during hospitalization, the 
infection control professional makes an assessment of 
each infection separately. For this estimate, we included 
deaths in which the HAI caused or contributed to the 
death, and refer to these as deaths associated with 
HAIs. Using NNIS infection data from 1999 to 2003, 
we calculated the percentage of patients with an HAI 
who died and the percentage of those whose death 
was associated with their HAI. We then multiplied the 
percentages within each of the four subpopulations by 
the estimate of patients with an HAI derived through 
steps 1–4. 
RESUltS
The total number of patient-days from NHDS in 2002 
was 176.4 million. Adults and children accounted for 
93.1% of patient-days (30.2 million in ICUs and 133.9 
million outside ICUs) and newborns for 6.9% (7.4 mil-
lion in well-baby nurseries, and 4.8 million in high-risk

nurseries). The infection rate per 1,000 patient-days was 
highest in ICUs (13.0), followed by high-risk nurseries 
(6.9), and well-baby nurseries (2.6) (Table 1). 
We estimated 274,098 surgical site infections in the 
U.S. population for procedures monitored in the NNIS 
system, or about two surgical site infections per 100 
procedures (Figure). Of these, 244,385 surgical site 
infections were among adults and children outside of 
ICUs. Knowing that the estimate of surgical site infec-
tions was 244,385 and that these were approximately 
20% of all infections, we estimated that for adults and 
children outside of ICUs, there were 424,060 urinary 
tract infections, 129,519 pneumonias, 133,368 blood-
stream infections, and 263,810 other infections. The 
estimated total HAIs among adults and children in 
hospitals but outside of ICUs was 1,195,142.
We estimated 33,269 HAIs among newborns in 
high-risk nurseries, 19,059 among newborns in well-
baby nurseries, 394,288 among adults and children 
in ICUs, and 1,195,142 among adults and children 
outside of ICUs (Table 2). The total number of HAIs 
among these subpopulations (1,641,758), adjusted to 
include federal facilities, was 1,737,125 HAI in the 
United States for 2002. This number represents a rate 
of 9.3 infections per 1,000 patient-days or 4.5 per 100 
admissions in 2002. 
Among the 1.7 million patients with an HAI in 
2002, there were 155,668 deaths, of which 98,987 were 
caused by or associated with the HAI. The percentage 
of patients whose deaths were associated with an HAI 
varied by major site and subpopulation. The lowest 
percentage was 0% of infants in well-baby nurseries 
with urinary tract infections, bloodstream infections, 
and surgical site infections. The highest percentage 
of patients with an HAI whose death was associated 
with the infection was among adults and children

NOTES: From the total number of surgical site infections (SSI) obtained from the National Hospital Discharge Dataset and the National Nosocomial 
Infections Surveillance (NNIS) system, we subtracted the number of SSI among newborns and adults and children in intensive care units. The 
remaining SSI were among adults and children outside of intensive care units. From hospital-wide surveillance in NNIS, we had the distribution of 
infections by major site and calculated the corresponding number of infections for pneumonias (PNEU), urinary tract infections (UTI), bloodstream 
infections (BSI), and other sites.

in ICUs, where the percentage varied from 11% for 
surgical site infections to 25% for bloodstream infec-
tions. The number of deaths associated with HAIs by 
major site combining the subpopulations was greatest 
for pneumonia (35,967) and bloodstream infections 
(30,665). An estimated 13,088 deaths were associated 
with urinary tract infections, 8,205 with surgical site 
infections, and 11,062 with infections of other sites. 
DISCUSSIon
We estimate that 1.7 million HAIs occurred in U.S. hos-
pitals in 2002 and were associated with approximately 
99,000 deaths. The number of HAIs exceeded the 
number of cases of any currently notifiable disease,13 
and deaths associated with HAIs in hospitals exceeded 
the number attributable to several of the top ten lead-
ing causes of death reported in U.S. vital statistics.14 
These estimates are sobering and reinforce the need 
for improved prevention and surveillance efforts. 
These estimates have several limitations. We used 
1990s data from hospital-wide surveillance for esti-
mates in 2002 in two areas: infection rates in well-baby 
nurseries and the distribution of infections by major 
site. Similar data are not available for a more recent 
time period. The impact of using old infection rates 
in well-baby nurseries is minimal because the rate was 
the lowest among the subpopulations and the total 
number of infections (19,059) was only 1.1% of the 
total number of infections. The distribution by major 
site of infection has a large impact on our estimates 
because adults and children outside of ICUs accounted 
for 68.8% of all HAIs. However, there is a lack of data 
in the United States to suggest that the distribution has 
changed since the 1990s. In other countries, recent 
studies provide support for using at least 20% for

surgical site infections as a percentage of infections 
by site.15–17 
We may have underestimated the total number of 
HAIs because surgical site infections are likely under-
reported in the NNIS system. Most surgical site infec-
tions become evident after discharge,18,19 and the com-
pleteness and accuracy of post-discharge surveillance 
is variable in NNIS hospitals. Since we extrapolated 
from the number of surgical site infections among 
adults and children outside of ICUs to other infection 
sites in the same population using NNIS infection 
rates, the total number might be underestimated. In 
addition, the decrease in the average hospital length 
of stay over time might have increased the chance of 
missing post-discharge surgical site infections.20 There 
may be other factors, however, such as a higher rate 
of infections that might result in an overestimate of 
infections. Therefore, we acknowledge a lack of preci-
sion in our estimates.
Infection rates from NNIS hospitals might be dif-
ferent than those in other hospitals. NNIS hospitals 
are frequently larger, more likely to be affiliated with 
academic institutions, and located in the mid- and 
south-Atlantic regions of the United States.21 Rates of 
HAIs from NNIS hospitals cannot be applied to other 
healthcare settings.
Finally, our death estimate is limited in that attrib-
utable mortality is often difficult to determine from 
a patient’s records. Even for experts, it can be prob-
lematic to determine whether patients die from their 
infection or from their co-morbidities.22 
Other methods might be useful to estimate national 
burden including prevalence surveys and use of sur-
rogate data. Annual prevalence surveys are used to 
measure the burden of HAIs in many countries. For 
example, prevalence per 100 admissions was 9.1 in 
Greece in 1999,15 8.0 in Denmark in 1999,16 7.0 in 
Spain in 1997,17 5.1 in Norway in 2002,23 and 4.6 in 
Slovenia in 2001.24 A disadvantage to annual prevalence 
surveys is that trends might reflect changes in case 
ascertainment over time rather than true changes in 
prevalence.25 In addition, data from annual prevalence 
surveys is less useful for prevention at the facility level. 
In the United States, prevalence surveys could be used 
periodically to supplement surveillance data to estimate 
HAIs in hospitals. 
There are several examples of using surrogate data 
from administrative records for surveillance purposes 
(e.g., the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] codes).26 
An evaluation of administrative data to identify injuries 
in children demonstrated high correlation, sensitivity, 
and specificity.27 Previously unrecognized differences 
in sepsis by race were described at the national level 
using ICD-9-CM codes;28 however, the frequency of 
HAIs has been more difficult to capture using admin-
istrative data. Some HAIs are captured in estimates 
using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qual-
ity patient safety indicators to estimate patient safety 
events during Medicare hospitalizations29 and by the 
mandatory reporting system in Pennsylvania.30 Evalu-
ations of these surrogate systems have so far indicated 
low sensitivity31,32 and low predictive value.31 An evalu-
ation of the performance of five different measures 
of bloodstream infections demonstrated improved 
performance of clinical indicators over administrative 
indicators.33 In general, the difficulty may be related 
to the need to determine if the infection is associated 
with the delivery of healthcare services. Standardized 
definitions and methods are features associated with 
the success of HAI surveillance.8
In 1995, CDC estimated that 1.9 million HAIs 
occurred in U.S. hospitals.34 In 2002, we estimated 1.7 
million HAIs. Direct comparison of these estimates 
should be avoided because both are based on the 
same hospital-wide surveillance data. However, our 
estimates of surgical site infections do not depend on 
hospital-wide data and might be useful to compare. 
In 1995, we estimated that there were 269,268 surgi-
cal site infections, or 2.21% of surgical procedures 
monitored in NNIS. In 2002, we estimated there were 
274,268 surgical site infections, or 1.96% of procedures 
monitored. 
New attention to HAIs and advances in informa-
tion technology could lead to greater participation of 
hospitals in organized surveillance efforts.35 At CDC, 
the evolution of the NNIS system into the NHSN has 
provided a web-based platform that could help address 
the need for HAI data at the local, state, and national 
levels. 
The authors are indebted to the NNIS/NHSN system participants 
for their ongoing efforts to monitor infections and improve 
patient safety.
