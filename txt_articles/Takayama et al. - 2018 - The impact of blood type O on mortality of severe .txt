Abstract
Background: Recent studies have implicated the differences in the ABO blood system as a potential risk for various
diseases, including hemostatic disorders and hemorrhage. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the difference
in the ABO blood type on mortality in patients with severe trauma.
Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted in two tertiary emergency critical care medical
centers in Japan. Patients with trauma with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15 were included. The association
between the different blood types (type O versus other blood types) and the outcomes of all-cause mortality,
cause-specific mortalities (exsanguination, traumatic brain injury, and others), ventilator-free days (VFD), and total
transfusion volume were evaluated using univariate and multivariate competing-risk regression models. Moreover,
the impact of blood type O on the outcomes was assessed using regression coefficients in the multivariate analysis
adjusted for age, ISS, and the Revised Trauma Score (RTS).
Results: A total of 901 patients were included in this study. The study population was divided based on the ABO
blood type: type O, 284 (32%); type A, 285 (32%); type B, 209 (23%); and type AB, 123 (13%). Blood type O was
associated with high mortality (28% in patients with blood type O versus 11% in patients with other blood types;
p < 0.001). Moreover, this association was observed in a multivariate model (adjusted odds ratio = 2.86, 95%
confidence interval 1.84–4.46; p < 0.001). The impact of blood type O on all-cause in-hospital mortality was
comparable to 12 increases in the ISS, 1.5 decreases in the RTS, and 26 increases in age. Furthermore, blood type
O was significantly associated with higher cause-specific mortalities and shorter VFD compared with the other
blood types; however, a significant difference was not observed in the transfusion volume between the two groups.
Conclusions: Blood type O was significantly associated with high mortality in severe trauma patients and might have
a great impact on outcomes. Further studies elucidating the mechanism underlying this association are warranted to
develop the appropriate intervention.

Background
The ABO blood system determines the carbohydrate
moieties that are expressed on red blood cells (RBCs)
and vascular endothelium. Furthermore, ABO antigens
are highly expressed on the surface of a variety of human
cells and tissues.
At the beginning of the 20th century, from the time
the system was discovered by Karl Landsteiner [1], the
ABO blood type was studied widely in relation to
diseases and blood transfusion complications. Recent
studies have implicated that the ABO blood type is a
potential risk for various diseases such as cancer, myo-
cardial infarction,
acute
kidney
injury,
and
venous
thromboembolism [2–5].
Furthermore, the ABO blood type has a profound
influence on hemostasis. The occurrence of venous
thromboembolism is relatively rare in individuals with

 blood type O compared with individuals with other
blood types [4, 5]. In addition, the relationship between
the difference in blood type and the risk of bleeding was
reported in patients with several diseases such as upper
gastrointestinal hemorrhage [6], hemorrhage during extra-
corporeal membrane oxygenation therapy [7], and obstet-
rical hemorrhage [8].
Hemorrhage is the leading cause of death in patients
with trauma and could deteriorate the outcome of trau-
matic brain injury (TBI) due to the increase in intracra-
nial hemorrhage. Therefore, we assessed the association
between the difference in blood type and the outcomes
of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in patients with
severe trauma on the assumption that the outcomes of
trauma are affected by the difference in blood type.
Methods
Study design and setting
This retrospective observational study aimed to evaluate
the association between ABO blood type and mortality
in patients with severe trauma who were transported be-
tween 1 April 2013 and 31 March 2016 to either of the
two tertiary emergency critical care medical centers in
Japan (Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital of
Medicine or Matsudo City Hospital).
This study complied with the principles of the 1964
Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. This
study was approved by the institutional review board of
Tokyo Medical and Dental University and Matsudo City
Hospital (#M2017–237 and #29–14, respectively). The
requirement for informed consent from each patient was
waived because the design of the study was retrospective
in nature and because of the use of anonymized patient
and hospital data.
Study populations
We included consecutive patients with trauma who suf-
fered severe injury as defined by an Injury Severity Score
(ISS) greater than 15 and who were directly transferred
from the scene of injury. Patients who met at least one
of the following criteria were excluded from the study:
1) patients younger than 15 years; 2) patients with car-
diac arrest upon arrival at the emergency department
(ED); 3) patients who suffered unsurvivable injury
(Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) = 6); and 4) patients
with a history of taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet
agents. In addition, patients whose clinical data for
analysis were missing or insufficient were excluded.
Data collection
The following information was retrospectively collected
from the patients’ medical records: age; sex; blood type
(A, B, AB, or O); Charlson Comorbidity Index [9]; the
number of patients who received uncrossmatched type
O RBC transfusions; AIS [10] of the head and neck, face,
chest, abdomen, pelvis and extremities, and surface; ISS;
Revised Trauma Score (RTS) calculated based on the
Glasgow Coma Scale, systolic blood pressure, and re-
spiratory rate upon arrival at the ED [11]; the total num-
ber of units of RBC transfusions administered within
24 h of ED admission; and status upon hospital dis-
charge (i.e., dead or alive). The causes of death were cat-
egorized into three groups: exsanguination, TBI, and
others (including multiple organ failure). We defined pa-
tients with isolated severe TBI as patients with a head
AIS ≥ 3 and AIS for other parts of the body ≤ 2.
Outcomes and definition
The primary outcome was defined as all-cause in-
hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes were de-
fined as cause-specific in-hospital mortality (exsanguin-
ation, TBI, and others), ventilator-free days (VFD) [12],
and total number of units of RBC transfusions adminis-
tered within the first 24 h from arrival at the ED. One
unit of transfusion is prepared from approximately
200 ml of whole blood in Japan, while it is prepared
from approximately 450 ml in the USA. Therefore, we
prepared transfusion units multiplied by 2.2 to convert
to a US standard form and we present them in US units.
As previously reported, multiple organ dysfunction syn-
drome was represented by an increase in the Sequential
Organ Failure Assessment score of 2 points or more in
more than one organ system [13].
Statistical analysis
The included population was divided into four groups
according to blood type (i.e., A, B, O, and AB). We used
a one-way analysis of variance to assess the differences
among the four groups. We further evaluated the differ-
ence between blood type O and non-O blood type for
the outcomes. In univariate analysis, continuous vari-
ables were compared using a Student’s t test or Mann-
Whitney U test, and categorical variables were compared
using the χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. A
multivariate logistic or linear regression analysis was
performed for the assessment of primary and secondary
outcomes
after
simultaneously
controlling
for
the
potential confounders. Variables incorporated into the
model were age, RTS, and ISS; these variables were
selected based on the clinical perspective (subject matter
knowledge) and the number of outcomes (the 10 events
per variable rule). The calibration of the model was
validated using a Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit
test; the discrimination of the model was assessed using
an optimism-corrected concordance (c) statistic, which
was calculated in 5000 bootstrap samples. The impact of
the difference in blood type on the outcomes was
assessed

 calculated using a logistic or linear regression analysis
and compared with that of other variables.
All statistical analyses were performed using the R
software (version 3.4.1; R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria). A command was used to
add statistical functions that were frequently used in the
biostatistics. Two-sided p values < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Results
Of 1049 potentially eligible patients, 901 severe trauma
patients were included in the analysis (Fig. 1). The study
population was divided based on the ABO blood type:
type O, 284 (32%); type A, 285 (32%); type B, 209 (23%);
and type AB, 123 (13%). The baseline characteristics of
patients and outcomes according to blood type are
shown in Table 1. Statistically significant difference
among the four groups was observed only for RTS (p = 0.
019); all remaining characteristics were similarly distributed.
There was a significant difference in all outcomes except
for the number of units of RBC transfusions administered
within 24 h. Table 2 provides the comparison of character-
istics and the result of univariate analysis for the outcomes
between blood type O and other blood types. While there
was no significant difference in ISS and AIS in all body re-
gions, patients with blood type O had significantly lower
RTS than those with non-O blood type (mean 6.85 (stand-
ard deviation (SD) 1.43) in blood type O versus 7.13 (1.15)
in other blood types; p = 0.003). Although the difference
was not statistically significant, the number of units of
RBC transfusions administered within 24 h tended to be
more in patients with blood type O than those with other
blood types (mean 3 (SD 9) units in blood type O versus
2 (7) units in other blood types; p = 0.112).
In the multivariate model, the p value of the Hosmer–
Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was 0.269, which sug-
gested that our model had acceptable predictability. The
calibration plot is presented in Additional file 1: Figure
S1. Furthermore, the value of concordance (c) statistics
(95% confidence interval (CI)) was 0.88 (0.85–0.91) for
crude data, and the value of optimism-corrected c statis-
tics calculated in 5000 bootstrapped samples was 0.88.
These statistics indicated excellent discrimination for the
model, and the issue of overfitting was eliminated in our
model. The results of the multivariate analysis are pre-
sented in Table 3 and Additional file 2: Table S1. After
controlling for age, ISS, and RTS, blood type O contin-
ued to be the independent risk factor for all-cause in-
hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.86 (95%
CI 1.84–4.46); p < 0.001), death due to exsanguination
(adjusted OR 2.55 (95% CI 1.25–5.22); p = 0.009), death
due to TBI (adjusted OR 1.80 (95% CI 1.08–3.01); p = 0.
024), death due to other causes (adjusted OR 2.73 (95%
CI 1.21–6.13); p = 0.015), and shorter VFD (adjusted dif-
ferences −2.7 days (95% CI −3.9 to −1.6), p < 0.001).
The impact of blood type O and other factors on re-
spective outcome is shown in Fig. 2.
The value of the regression coefficient of blood type O
for all-cause in-hospital mortality was approximately 12-
fold, −1.5-fold, and 26-fold compared with that for ISS,
RTS, and age, respectively. This result indicated that the
impact of blood type O on in-hospital mortality was
comparable to 12 increases in ISS, 1.5 decreases in
RTS, and 26 increases in age. For death due to exsan-
guination, the value of the regression coefficient of
blood type O was approximately 12-fold, −2.5-fold,
and 55-fold compared with that for ISS, RTS, and age,
respectively.

 Discussion
In this retrospective study, we evaluated the association
between blood type O and the mortality in 901 patients
with severe trauma. Findings indicated that blood type
O was the independent risk factor for all-cause in-
hospital mortality and death due to exsanguination,
TBI, and other causes after adjusting for potential con-
founders. The number of units of RBC transfusions ad-
ministered within 24 h upon admission to the ED
tended to be more in patients with blood type O; how-
ever, there was no significant difference between blood
type O and other blood types. To the best of our know-
ledge, this is the first study to report the association be-
tween ABO blood type and mortality in patients with
severe trauma. Although we cannot alter the risk of
blood type O itself, an adequate recognition of the risk
enables us to control for the intensity of trauma critical
care. Recognizing those patients requiring damage-control
resuscitation is a crucial issue since damage-control resus-
citation, including strategic multiple operation, sufficient
amounts of available transfusions with adequate ratios,
and perioperative critical care, requires a large amount
of human and healthcare resources. Therefore, recog-
nizing the additional risk of the difference in blood type
would imply the potential to optimize the implementa-
tion or damage-control resuscitation and indirectly im-
prove the outcome of patients with severe trauma.
Several studies have reported that patients with blood
type O had 25–30% lower plasma von Willebrand factor
(vWF) levels than the those with non-O blood, increas-
ing their risk of hemorrhage [14, 15]. vWF plays a de-
cisive role in primary hemostasis by mediating the
adhesion of blood platelets to the subendothelium of the
damaged vessel walls and promoting the aggregation of
activated platelets. In addition, vWF acts as a carrier of
factor VIII clotting activity and protects it from prema-
ture proteolysis [16–18]. Therefore, a lower vWF level is
a possible explanation for the increase in mortality in
patients with blood type O, as observed in this study.
However, many of the differences in the mechanisms of
hemostasis according to blood type remain unknown.
Further basic study is warranted to reveal the role of
blood type in maintaining hemostasis during critical
situations.
Although
the results of the multivariate
analysis
showed that blood type O was an independent risk fac-
tor for all-cause trauma-related mortality and death due
to exsanguination, there was no significant difference in

We used a one-way analysis of variance to assess the differences among the four blood groups

 the number of units of RBC transfusions administered
within 24 h of admission in patients with blood type O
compared with those with other blood types. One pos-
sible explanation for this discrepancy is the issue of sur-
vivor bias. Patients who died shortly after ED arrival or
who did not have a surgical indication due to too severe
an injury were less likely to receive large amounts of
transfusion. Another possible explanation was beta
error. The number of patients who received a RBC
transfusion was only 20% of the total patients included,
and it prevented us from detecting the significant differ-
ence between the two groups.
In this study, although ISS was similar between the two
groups, RTS observed in patients with blood type O was
lower than that in patients with other blood types. The
physiological status of patients with blood type O may de-
teriorate even if these patients suffered injuries of the
same intensity. Because this was a retrospective cohort
study with a limited sample size, patient background could
not be similarly distributed, and it was uncertain whether
the statistically significant difference observed in RTS was
a clinically meaningful result. Although completely
adjusting the difference using a statistical approach was
generally insufficient, in this study the RTS value was

 incorporated into the model and the difference was
accounted for. Our results demonstrated that the impact
of blood type O on trauma death was extremely high. The
impact of blood type O on all-cause mortality was com-
parable to 12 increases in ISS, 1.5 decrease in RTS, and 26
increases in age. Furthermore, the impact of blood type O
seemed to be higher for the outcome of death due to ex-
sanguination than the all-cause trauma-related mortality.
It would be of great significance for clinicians to recognize
the potential risk of blood type O.
Several limitations should be considered in the inter-
pretation of our findings. First, because this was a retro-
spective study with a limited sample size, the risk of
residual confounding and the risk of type I error remain.
Additional work is necessary to provide more definitive
data, including large-scale multicenter studies. Second,
we only evaluated the phenotype and not the genotype
of the ABO blood group or Rh system. The highest
levels of clotting vVIII and vWF were observed in the
A1A/A1B/BB genotype, intermediate levels in the A1O/
BO genotype, and lowest levels in the OO genotype [19].
Possibly, by comparing type O to non-O blood type in-
stead of A1A/A1B/BB to OO, the effect of ABO on prog-
nosis was diluted. In addition, in this study, only two
patients had Rh-negative blood, and this prevented us
from assessing the statistical difference between Rh-
positive and Rh-negative patients. Third, all the patients
analyzed in this study were Japanese; therefore, it is un-
clear whether our findings apply to other ethnic groups.
Finally, patients who had received anticoagulant and/or
antiplatelet therapy were excluded from this study be-
cause these agents could largely influence the mortality
and hemorrhage in severe trauma patients; this process
could cause a selection bias—if the difference in blood
type is related to thrombotic diseases, patients with the
blood type that were less likely to suffer from throm-
botic diseases were less likely to receive those therapies.
However, in this study, the excluded patients due to anti-
coagulant and/or antiplatelet therapy was similarly distrib-
uted among each blood type (type O, 12; type A, 15; type B,
10; and type AB, 8); therefore, this process would not
largely affect the results. Despite these limitations, we ini-
tially show a significant association between blood type O
and mortality in patients with severe trauma. Furthermore,
the impact of blood type O on trauma-related death was
found to be high. Further research beyond this epidemio-
logical study that evaluates where and how ABO antigens
work (through blood, endothelial, or vWF, and the mecha-
nisms, respectively) are warranted to assess the effects of
emergency uncrossmatched type O RBC transfusion and
the possibility of novel therapeutic interventions.
Conclusion
The results of this study suggest that blood type O is asso-
ciated with mortality and exsanguination in patients with
severe trauma. Further basic or translational research is
necessary to investigate the cause of this result and may
lead to the development of a therapeutic intervention.
