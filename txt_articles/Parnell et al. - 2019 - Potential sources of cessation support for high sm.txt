ustralia has among the lowest 
rates of smoking in the world. The 
population prevalence of daily 
smoking is currently at 12%;1 however, rates 
are significantly higher among specific 
population segments. These include people 
living with a mental illness (29%–70%), 
people experiencing alcohol and other 
drug dependence (77%–93%), and people 
experiencing homelessness (76%–84%).1–6 
Different forms of disadvantage often occur 
in combination (e.g. people experiencing 
homelessness can also be living with a 
mental illness and experiencing alcohol 
and other drug dependence).7 Due to high 
smoking prevalence rates, these groups are 
disproportionately affected by tobacco-
related illnesses.8 A majority of people 
experiencing disadvantage have been found 
to express an interest in quitting smoking.9 
However, they often have lower levels of 
success when quitting than other people who 
smoke.9
The likelihood of quit attempts being 
successful can be improved when sources 
of cessation support are used.10-12 Many 
services are available in Australia to provide 
support to people to quit, such as brief 
interventions from health professionals, 
the Quitline telephone counselling service, 
and online services such as the smartphone 
application My QuitBuddy.13 Overall, the 
sources of cessation support most commonly 
accessed in Australia are doctors (10%), 
cessation literature (9%), internet resources 
(5%), smartphone applications (4%), and the 
Quitline (2%).1 Sources of cessation support 
that have previously been identified as being 
acceptable among vulnerable populations 
(e.g. Indigenous peoples) include doctors 
and interventions delivered via mobile 
phones.14,15
Although utilisation rates of cessation 
support services by Australian smokers 
of lower socioeconomic status have 
improved over time to be relatively on par 
with smokers of higher socioeconomic 
status,14 little is known about the cessation 
behaviours of people experiencing other 
forms of disadvantage such as homelessness, 
mental illness, and alcohol and other drug 
dependence. These smokers may face 
unique barriers to using cessation support. 
For example, health professionals have been 
found less likely to provide people living 
with a mental illness or alcohol and other 
drug dependence with cessation support 
due to the belief that: i) cessation can be 
detrimental to clients’ mental health; ii) other 
aspects of treatment are prioritised; and/
or iii) their clients do not want to quit.16,17 
These perceptions exist despite evidence 
that smoking cessation does not significantly 
affect substance use treatment outcomes 
or symptoms of mental illness and, in some

Abstract
Objective: This study aimed to: i) explore potential sources of cessation support as nominated 
by disadvantaged smokers; and ii) identify factors influencing decisions to use these sources.
Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 84 smokers accessing community 
service organisations from the alcohol and other drugs, homeless, and mental health sectors. 
Transcripts were coded and thematically analysed.
Results: Doctors emerged as the most commonly recognised source of cessation support, 
followed by Quitline, community service organisation staff; and online resources. The main 
factors contributing to the possible use of these sources of support were identified as 
awareness, perceived usefulness and anticipated emotional support.
Conclusions: The results suggest that doctors are an important group to consider when 
developing cessation interventions for disadvantaged smokers due to their recognised ability 
to provide practical and emotional support. However, efforts are needed to ensure doctors are 
aware of the benefits of cessation for these groups. Community service organisations appear to 
be another potentially effective source of cessation support for disadvantaged smokers.
Implications for public health: The results indicate that cessation interventions among high-
priority groups should endeavour to provide personalised emotional and practical support. 
Doctors and community service organisation staff appear to be well-placed to deliver this 
support.

cases, can improve both.18,19 Other barriers 
to receiving cessation support among 
smokers experiencing disadvantage include 
limited access to healthcare due to a lack 
of transportation, being stigmatised due to 
living with a mental illness and/or alcohol and 
other drug dependence, and doubts about 
the usefulness of quit support.20-22
The limited previous research with high 
smoking prevalence groups has tended to 
focus on general barriers to quitting.17,21 Prior 
work does not appear to have investigated 
the factors influencing the acceptability 
of various sources of cessation support, 
and this information is needed to develop 
strategies to increase the acceptability and 
attractiveness of support options. To address 
this knowledge deficit, the present study 
focused on attitudes to sources of cessation 
support among three priority groups: people 
experiencing homelessness; mental illness; 
and/or alcohol and other drug dependence. 
The study aims were to explore the potential 
sources of cessation support identified by 
smokers experiencing disadvantage and gain 
a greater understanding of the factors that 
influence their decisions to use these sources. 
The findings can inform future efforts to 
increase utilisation of evidence-based sources 
of cessation support among members of 
these groups. 
Methods
Semi-structured individual interviews were 
conducted with clients accessing community 
service organisations (CSOs) located in 
metropolitan and regional Western Australia. 
CSOs are not-for-profit organisations 
that provide services to members of 
the community who are experiencing 
disadvantage. The interviews were conducted 
as a part of a larger study investigating 
tobacco-related attitudes and behaviours 
among clients in CSOs.23 The researchers who 
conducted the interviews were experienced 
in the area of tobacco control.
Recruitment
Interviewee recruitment took place in seven 
non-profit CSOs (see Table 1). To be eligible 
to participate, CSO clients were required 
to be aged 18 years or older, a current 
smoker and English-speaking. Clients were 
informed about the study by CSO staff via 
announcements and signage located around 
the services and were able to approach the 
researchers if they wanted to participate. 
No incentives were offered to clients in 
exchange for their participation in the study. 
Interviewees were asked to provide written 
and/or verbal consent to be interviewed and 
audio recorded. In the case that consent to 
being recorded was not given (n=4), a second 
researcher took detailed notes throughout 
the interview. On average, the interviews 
lasted 25 minutes (range 6–49 minutes).
Data collection
Interviews were conducted between March 
2016 and March 2017. Two researchers spent 
approximately one week at each CSO location 
to allow clients time to become comfortable 
with their presence and to approach them 
if/when they were ready. Upon expressing 
their interest in participating in the study, 
interviewees answered preliminary 
questions relating to their age, gender and 
main source of income. An interview guide 
was used to direct a general discussion 
about interviewees’ tobacco use. Topics 
relating to the larger study included clients’ 
smoking history, what they like/dislike 
about smoking and their views on tobacco 
control regulations. The topics raised with 
interviewees that related to the present study 
were their experiences with and interest 
in quitting and where they could receive 
information/help if they ever wanted to quit 
(e.g. “Where would you go to get support if 
you were at the point of wanting to quit?”). 
This approach ensured that interviewees who 
did not express an interest in quitting were 
still asked if they knew where they could 
receive cessation support. If not mentioned 
spontaneously, interviewees were also asked 
about any quit support provided to them 
by the CSO staff (e.g. “Have you spoken to 
the staff here about your smoking?” or “How 
would you feel about staff offering you 
support to quit or cut down smoking?”).
Data analysis
Interview recordings were transcribed 
verbatim. Transcripts and detailed notes 
were imported into the qualitative data 
analysis program NVivo 11. Interviews were 
coded by line unit and the coded data were 
then thematically analysed. Data were 
coded by a single coder (the first author) 
and an emergent coding process was used 
to allow novel findings to be identified. The 
sections of the transcripts that related to 
sources of cessation support were read by 
a second researcher and potential themes 
were discussed to reach a consensus on the 
findings. The other members of the research 
team were then consulted to refine the 
findings.
Results
Sample
Eighty-four CSO clients participated in the 
interviews. Table 2 shows the demographic 
characteristics of the sample. Most of the 
sample members were male (75%) and 
reported government payments as their main 
source of income.
Potential sources of cessation support 
Most of the interviewees had previously 
attempted to quit smoking and reported an 
interest in trying again in the future. Lengths 
of sustained cessation in the past ranged 
from days to years. Most of the minority who 
did not wish to quit still nominated potential 
sources of cessation support should they 
decide to quit. Overall, whether discussing 
past or future quit attempts, the hierarchy of 
sources of support identified by interviewees 
remained the same. Doctors were the most 
commonly identified source of cessation 
support, followed by the Quitline, then CSO 
staff and finally online resources. Results were 
comparable across age groups.
Factors influencing intentions
Three factors were described as being the 
primary decision criteria used to assess 
cessation support options: i) awareness of 
the existence and availability of the source 
of quit support; ii) the perceived usefulness 
of the information provided by the source; 
and iii) the anticipated emotional support 
(e.g. encouragement and motivation) 
offered by the source. The matrix shown 
in Table 3 illustrates how each source was 
rated in terms of these criteria. The number

of ticks represents the extent to which the 
relationship between the source and the 
relevant decision criterion was evident in 
the interviewee discussions. The findings 
relevant to each source of support are 
outlined below and are accompanied by 
illustrative quotes from the interviewees. 
The following descriptors have been 
used: gender: F=female, M=male; type 
of CSO: AOD=alcohol and other drugs, 
H=homelessness, MH=mental health; and 
CSO location: metropolitan, regional.
Doctors
When asked about where they could access 
information and/or support to quit smoking, 
interviewees from all three types of CSOs 
most frequently mentioned doctors, although 
this was especially notable among those 
attending mental health services. Most who 
spoke about doctors referred to general 
practitioners (GPs), with doctors who work 
in hospitals and dentists also mentioned 
occasionally. The high unprompted 
awareness of doctors appeared to have been 
at least partly due to this form of assistance 
occurring in both active and passive modes: 
smokers can ask doctors for quit assistance 
and doctors can raise the topic of quitting 
with their patients.
(Quitting is) brought up constantly when 
you’re a stroke sufferer. But then … you 
make the decision to say, ‘I want to make 
sure I survive’
. So, from there they just kept 
encouraging it and looking for ways (they) 
could help. (M, H, metropolitan)
The interviewees generally described 
doctors as being able to provide useful 
information about quitting, especially in 
terms of cessation medications and nicotine 
replacement therapies (NRT). 
 I went to my doctor’s just last week, actually. 
I said to her, ‘My lungs are feeling like shit, I 
need the patches’
. So, we’re starting on the 
21 milligrams … But hopefully within the 
first two weeks, I should not need the 21 
milligrams anymore because 21 milligrams is 
prescribed for people who are smoking 20 a 
day … which I’m not. So, she’s even suggested 
to cut the patch in half. (F, H, metropolitan)
High levels of trust were expressed, although 
at times this was a double-edged sword due 
to the reported tendency for some doctors to 
advise against quitting and the acceptance 
of this advice by smokers. This situation 
appeared to be most prevalent among 
those accessing mental health services, 
with tobacco use apparently considered a 
secondary health priority for some of these 
patients, consequently negatively affecting 
their self-efficacy.
I’ve had (doctors) say to me, ‘Don’t give up 
smoking just yet, because you’ll fail’
. I had 
too much going on … Yeah, and they were 
right. I would have failed and just put myself 
through a bit of trauma for nothing. (F, MH, 
metropolitan)
I’m trying to quit meth and I’m trying to quit 
marijuana and I miss my kids and all that 
sort of stuff. And to quit smoking at the same 
time, I got told by the GP not to do it. (M, MH, 
metropolitan)
As well as being a valued source of advice, 
doctors were described by some interviewees 
as being willing and able to provide the 
emotional support needed to achieve 
successful cessation. In particular, some 
interviewees reported having seen the same 
doctor for an extended period of time, and 
thus having an established relationship that 
gave the doctor a firm understanding and 
appreciation of their circumstances. 
I’d go straight to my GP. I’ve got an amazing 
doctor at home. She’s wonderful. If I went 
to her and said, ‘That’s it, I want to quit 
smoking,’ she’d be like, ‘Yep, no worries, about 
time, let’s go’
. She’d be there for me. (F, AOD, 
metropolitan)
Quitline
There were high apparent levels of 
unprompted awareness of the Quitline as 
a source of cessation support across the 
sample. This appeared to be primarily due to 
the regular promotion of the Quitline during 
tobacco control campaigns.
Facilitator: You said you’re wanting to quit, 
would you know of anywhere to go to get 
information or support from anyone?
Interviewee: No. Except the Quitline, like I’ve 
seen on TV. (F, MH, metropolitan)
Although awareness of the service was high, 
perceptions of the utility of the information 
provided by the Quitline were mixed. Some 
interviewees, especially those who had 
previously accessed the service, reported 
that practical information is provided that 
can assist smokers to quit and stay quit. 
Others felt that the advice would not be 
new or would not relate to their particular 
circumstances, or that the recommended 
cessation techniques were inappropriate or 
ineffective.
Facilitator: Would you phone (the Quitline) 
again?
Interviewee: No, because I know what they 
say … The 4 Ds, and the drink and the stuff 
like that – sip drinks and all that. (M, H, 
metropolitan)
The guy on the Quitline just said reward 
yourself with lollies or chocolates or biscuits or 
something. I would put on too much weight if 
I did that. (M, MH, metropolitan)
Perceptions of the emotional support 
provided by the Quitline were also variable. 
Some felt that the optional follow-up services 
offered by the Quitline could provide the 
support needed to sustain a quit attempt. 
Others did not like the idea of talking to 
strangers about their smoking habits, 
especially if it was necessary to speak to a 
different person each time.
I suppose if I get to the stage where I am 
quitting and I’m struggling, I would probably 
ring them then and have a chat with 
somebody who’ll … give me some boost in 
confidence – definitely. (M, AOD, regional)

Cessation support for high smoking prevalence groups
Quitline is pretty good for some people. I 
gave them my number. Ringing me back 
encouraged me to give up and that. (M, MH, 
metropolitan)
You feel strange ringing a stranger, if it’s 
someone different every time, because then 
you have to explain everything all over again. 
(F, H, regional)
Community service organisation staff
If CSOs were not mentioned spontaneously, 
interviewees were directly asked about their 
willingness to receive smoking cessation 
assistance from CSO staff members. Although 
it appeared to be a form of cessation support 
they had not previously considered, most 
were receptive to the idea. Especially among 
those attending AOD CSOs, addressing 
their tobacco use was seen as a logical step 
while they were focusing on their other 
drug dependence. Some interviewees had 
already been supplied with various forms of 
quit support by CSO staff, such as integrating 
goals to quit smoking into their care plans 
and the provision of cessation advice and 
literature. It was also noted that CSO staff 
could refer clients to other forms of cessation 
support such as the Quitline and healthcare 
providers.
I’ve only just started one-on-one counselling, 
so my care plan is in its infancy sort of thing 
… The first goal that I’ve put in my care plan 
is to work on my overall fitness and general 
health. So, sugar, caffeine, nicotine – all those 
sort of things – because they’re all tied in with 
addiction. (M, AOD, metropolitan)
For instance, here, they provide a lot of things 
… If they can’t do something, they’ll refer you 
to somewhere else. There’s hospitals, there’s 
private health centres … there’s a variety of 
networks. (M, H, regional)
In some cases, interviewees reported that 
they had formed trusting relationships 
with CSO staff, which enabled them to feel 
comfortable in seeking or receiving support 
from them. Similar to the case with doctors, 
these relationships were described as being 
conducive to high levels of understanding of 
the particular circumstances of the individual 
and hence were considered to be more 
likely to result in acceptable interactions and 
outcomes.
If I’m having a hard time of coping, they pick 
up on it, they’re really good. They know – 
because I’m bipolar, I’m mostly manic most 
of the time, I don’t get really low or something 
unless I’m triggered. If they see that I’m not 
coping or I’m not being sociable … then 
they ask what’s wrong and I’m sort of like, 
‘I’m trying - struggling hard to quit smoking’
. 
We have a little talk and it’s a bit like that.  
(M, MH, metropolitan)
They’re good here. They don’t judge. They 
try and help as much as they can. If you are 
having a bad day and you want to have a 
cigarette, they’d say, ‘You know you don’t 
really want to, but if you must, you must’
. But 
they won’t judge you if you do. (F, H, regional)
Online resources
Among the various sources of cessation 
support discussed by the interviewees, 
awareness of online resources was 
relatively low. Of the few who perceived 
these resources to be a viable option, 
most indicated that they would either use 
generic search engines to locate relevant 
information or access the Quit website. Very 
few interviewees reported either using or 
planning to use smartphone applications, 
and there was no mention of available 
interactive quit assistance websites that can 
offer personalised information.
Facilitator: So, if you were trying to seek some 
information about quitting – where would  
you go to find that information?
Interviewee: Internet … The search stream 
would be ‘stop smoking’ – simple. It’s common 
sense. (M, H, metropolitan)
Among those using online resources as a 
source of cessation support, the main types of 
information sought were facts about quitting 
and how to source cessation aids.
Me and another guy are jumping online 
today to look up on the Quit website to look 
at patches … because when we finish this 
pouch of tobacco, we are going to make 
a fairly concerted effort to stop. (M, AOD, 
metropolitan)
Discussion
This study explored where people from high 
smoking prevalence groups would seek 
support during a cessation attempt. The 
primary factors that appeared to influence 
interviewees’ identification of particular 
sources of support were awareness of 
the source, perceived usefulness of the 
information provided and anticipated 
emotional support. When discussing quit 
attempts, most interviewees nominated 
doctors as the sources of support they could 
access, followed by Quitline, CSOs and online 
resources. Results were consistent across the 
three types of CSOs included in the study 
(alcohol and other drugs, homelessness and 
mental health services). 
Doctors were the most commonly identified 
source of smoking cessation support 
for people experiencing these forms of 
disadvantage. This finding is in accordance 
with prior Australian research in which 
doctors have been found to be the most 
frequently accessed source of quit support 
for smokers in general.1 This preference for 
doctors seemed to be due largely to the 
practical information interviewees perceived 
would be provided (especially regarding 
NRT and cessation medications), along with 
relatively high levels of anticipated emotional 
support. However, some interviewees, 
particularly those accessing mental health 
CSOs, had been advised by their doctors that 
they should not quit smoking because their 
other health conditions should be prioritised. 
This experience reflects findings previously 
reported in the literature that people living 
with a mental illness and/or affected by 
alcohol and other drug use are sometimes 
dissuaded from quitting.16,17 To reduce 
health inequities, it is important to address 
tobacco use among populations with high 
smoking rates; the findings of the present 
study suggest that doctors could benefit 
from receiving additional support, education 
about current smoking cessation guidelines 
and training to enable them to better 
support these groups. People experiencing 
homelessness may have limited access to 
traditional healthcare settings and may be 
more likely to access doctors through street 
outreach services.20 These services could also 
benefit from receiving additional training and 
support to encourage smoking cessation.
Community service organisations received 
low levels of awareness as a source of 
cessation support. However, interviewees 
were receptive to the idea of receiving 
information and support from the services 
they were accessing, especially due to the 
emotional support they anticipated they 
would receive from staff during a cessation 
attempt. Given the interviewees’ current 
use of CSOs, these organisations represent 
a promising potential source of cessation 
assistance. Previous research has found that 
trials of smoking cessation programs offered 
in CSOs were considered acceptable and 
useful by clients24 and that upskilling staff to 
provide quit support is effective in increasing 
the provision of cessation advice.25 A 
recurring theme in the data was interviewees’ 
desire for ongoing support, especially from 
 112

2019 vol. 43 no. 2

someone who had an understanding of their 
personal circumstances. For clients who have 
regular contact with a CSO, staff members 
could potentially offer this continued support. 
To address a lack of awareness of CSOs as 
a potential source of cessation support, 
organisations could implement policies 
that include offering brief intervention to all 
clients who smoke. 
Interviewees had a relatively high awareness 
of the Quitline as a source of cessation 
support: however, it received mixed 
responses regarding perceived usefulness 
and emotional support. For smokers living 
with a mental illness, it has been found 
that using the Quitline in conjunction with 
support from a health practitioner may 
increase the likelihood of cessation attempts 
being successful.26 Some interviewees were 
hesitant to contact the Quitline because of 
their preference to discuss the issue with 
someone who had an understanding of 
their personal circumstances. The findings 
indicate that uptake of the Quitline service 
among CSO clients may be improved by 
raising awareness of its call-back service and 
that counsellors can keep confidential case 
notes so that they will not have to repeat 
themselves each time they call.
Online resources had a low level of 
salience and appeared to be rarely used by 
interviewees. Given that tailored cessation 
support offered through internet-based 
resources has been found to improve the 
likelihood of successful quit attempts among 
the general population,27 this option may 
represent an underused alternative that could 
be the focus of future interventions. Access to 
technology is not necessarily a major barrier, 
as Australians experiencing homelessness 
have high rates of mobile phone use and 
approximately three-quarters have access to a 
smartphone; however, data charges may be a 
possible barrier to use if public Wi-Fi hotspots 
are unavailable.28 Given the lack of research 
on utilisation of online cessation resources 
by people experiencing disadvantage, 
future research could invite members of 
these groups to assist in the design of online 
resources to ensure they are acceptable and 
appropriate for addressing their specific 
needs. For example, in the present study, 
online resources were not identified by 
interviewees as providing emotional support 
during quit attempts, so future online 
interventions may include features to address 
this concern. 
Strengths and limitations
The high number of participants for 
a qualitative study was a strength of 
the research; however, the sample was 
confined to people accessing CSOs in 
Western Australia, so the results may not be 
generalisable to other geographical locations. 
A larger sample size may have yielded more 
differences between clients recruited from 
different kinds of CSOs. Larger-scale studies 
may be needed to provide greater insights 
into these potential differences. In addition, 
since interviewees were required to opt-
in to the study, clients who had a greater 
interest in quitting smoking may have been 
more likely to elect to participate in the 
research. The potential for bias arising from 
the data being coded by one researcher 
was minimised through the discussion 
of emerging interpretations with other 
members of the research team. The analysis 
of the interview data from the participants 
who did not consent to being recorded may 
not have been as in-depth as for those who 
were transcribed, given the restrictive nature 
of note taking. Furthermore, only three 
priority high smoking prevalence groups 
were included in the study. Possible areas for 
future research could be exploring the factors 
that influence the acceptability of sources 
of quit support among other high smoking 
prevalence populations in Australia such as 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, 
people from culturally and linguistically 
diverse backgrounds and people in prison.13 
Conclusions
This study examined the cessation support 
options that were most commonly identified 
by people experiencing disadvantage and 
the factors that influenced their interest 
in accessing these services. The results 
may inform future efforts to provide 
cessation support to people experiencing 
disadvantage. In particular, the findings 
highlight the importance of personalised 
support and of individuals being able to 
access assistance from someone who has 
an understanding of their specific situation. 
While doctors were considered favourably 
due to their ability to offer both practical 
and emotional support, there appears to be 
a need to address misconceptions among 
some doctors regarding treating tobacco 
dependence simultaneously with mental 
illnesses and/or alcohol and other drug 
dependence. Future interventions could also 
focus on CSOs as a setting to provide quit 
support to high smoking prevalence groups 
as they already have a trusted relationship 
and may be able to provide practical and 
emotional support. Such interventions 
would ideally upskill staff and introduce 
organisational policies and strategies that 
support cessation. Regardless of the form of 
support provided, the results suggest that
