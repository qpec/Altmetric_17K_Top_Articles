ABSTRACT
Colistin is increasingly used as an antibiotic of last resort for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative
infections. The plasmid-borne colistin resistance gene mcr-1 was initially identified in animal and clinical samples from China
and subsequently reported worldwide, including in the United States. Of particular concern is the spread of mcr-1 into
carbapenem-resistant bacteria, thereby creating strains that approach pan-resistance. While several reports of mcr-1 have in-
volved carbapenem-resistant strains, no such isolates have been described in the United States. Here, we report the isolation and
identification of an Escherichia coli strain harboring both mcr-1 and carbapenemase gene blaNDM-5 from a urine sample in a pa-
tient without recent travel outside the United States. The isolate exhibited resistance to both colistin and carbapenems, but was
susceptible to amikacin, aztreonam, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, tigecycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The mcr-1-
and blaNDM-5-harboring plasmids were completely sequenced and shown to be highly similar to plasmids previously reported
from China. The strain in this report was first isolated in August 2014, highlighting an earlier presence of mcr-1 within the
United States than previously recognized.
IMPORTANCE
Colistin has become the last line of defense for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria re-
sistant to multiple classes of antibiotics, in particular carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Resistance to colistin,
encoded by the plasmid-borne gene mcr-1, was first identified in animal and clinical samples from China in November 2015 and
has subsequently been reported from numerous other countries. In April 2016, mcr-1 was identified in a carbapenem-susceptible
Escherichia coli strain from a clinical sample in the United States, followed by a second report from a carbapenem-susceptible
E. coli strain originally isolated in May 2015. We report the isolation and identification of an E. coli strain harboring both colis-
tin (mcr-1) and carbapenem (blaNDM-5) resistance genes, originally isolated in August 2014 from urine of a patient with recurrent
urinary tract infections. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the United States of a clinical bacterial isolate with both
colistin and carbapenem resistance, highlighting the importance of active surveillance efforts for colistin- and carbapenem-
resistant organisms.

P
olymyxins are increasingly used as antibiotics of last resort for
clinical infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-
negative bacteria, especially carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteri-
aceae (CRE) (1). The recent discovery of transmissible colistin
resistance in China (2) has led to numerous reports of the
plasmid-borne gene mcr-1 in animal, food, and clinical samples
worldwide (3). Of particular concern is the spread of mcr-1 into
CRE, thereby creating highly drug-resistant strains that are poten-
tially untreatable. Several reports outside the United States have
already described mcr-1 in bacterial strains harboring carbapen-
emases, including NDM-1 (4), NDM-5 (5–7), NDM-9 (8), KPC-2
(9), OXA-48 (10), and VIM-1 (11). Most recently, mcr-1 was de-
tected in two clinical carbapenem-susceptible Escherichia coli
strains from the United States, isolated from urine cultures ob-
tained in April 2016 (12) and May 2015 (13), respectively. Here,
we report the identification from urine of an E. coli strain harbor-
ing both mcr-1 and carbapenemase gene blaNDM-5, originally iso-
lated in August 2014 from a U.S. patient with recurrent urinary
tract infections and no recent travel history.
A 76-year-old man presented to a tertiary-care hospital in New
Jersey with subjective fever and flank pain in August 2014. The
patient had emigrated from India and resided continuously in the
United States for 1 year prior to this presentation. He had a history
of prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy and subsequently
developed recurrent urinary tract infections. He had recently un-
dergone cystoscopy to evaluate the possibility of colovesicular fis-
tula formation. The procedure was complicated by bladder perfo-
ration requiring bilateral nephrostomy tube placement. The

 nephrostomy tubes were clamped 5 days prior to presentation,
and he then developed subjective fever, chills, and generalized
weakness. Laboratory testing on presentation indicated a leuko-
cyte count of 14.1 � 103 cells/�l, associated with pyuria. The ini-
tial antimicrobial regimen included intravenous piperacillin-
tazobactam and vancomycin. No fistula was seen on imaging
studies, and the nephrostomy tubes were unclamped.
The susceptibility results of urine cultures obtained prior to the
initiation of antimicrobial therapy are shown in Table 1. A clean-
catch urine culture grew greater than 100,000 CFU per ml of Pseu-
domonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter koseri, and Enterococcus faecium.
A urine culture obtained from the nephrostomy tube grew
�100,000 CFU/ml of P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Enterococcus spp., and Staphylococcus aureus (meth-
icillin resistant). Susceptibility testing results showed that the
E. coli isolate was resistant to colistin and all �-lactams (including
carbapenems) except aztreonam, but remained susceptible to
amikacin, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, tigecycline, and tri-
methoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Table 1). The P. aeruginosa isolate
was susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam and colistin but exhib-
ited resistance or intermediate resistance to other agents tested,
including carbapenems. In contrast, the C. koseri and K. pneu-
moniae isolates were resistant to only ampicillin, with the latter
also exhibiting intermediate resistance to nitrofurantoin. Based
on these culture results, oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was
added to the antimicrobial regimen, although by this point the
patient had remained afebrile and the leukocyte count had nor-
malized. A sterile clean-catch urine culture was obtained after
6 days of antimicrobial therapy. The patient returned home after
undergoing a urinary diversion with ileal conduit.
Since 2014, our laboratory has used molecular methods to an-
alyze clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacteria obtained from
this affiliated tertiary-care hospital, including 16S sequencing;
multilocus sequence typing (MLST); and PCR detection of
carbapenemases,
AmpC
�-lactamases,
extended-spectrum
�-lactamase genes, and, more recently, the mcr-1 gene. Using
these methods, the E. coli isolate from the study case (named
MCR1_NJ) was shown to carry both mcr-1 and blaNDM-5 genes.
Whole-genome sequencing of E. coli strain MCR1_NJ was per-
formed using an Illumina NextSeq platform (San Diego, CA), and
the resistome was investigated using ResFinder 2.1 (14). In addi-
tion to mcr-1 and blaNDM-5, strain MCR1_NJ was found to harbor
resistance genes for aminoglycosides [strA, strB, and aac(6=)-Ib-
cr], �-lactams (blaOXA-1), chloramphenicol (catB3 and floR), fluo-
roquinolones [aac(6=)-Ib-cr], rifampin (arr-3), sulfonamides
(sul1 and sul2), and tetracycline [tet(A)].
The mcr-1- and blaNDM-5-harboring plasmids from E. coli
strain MCR1_NJ were transferred to E. coli DH10B by electropo-
ration, thereby confirming the mutually exclusive presence of
mcr-1 and blaNDM-5 in the resulting transformants. The conju-
gability of the mcr-1 plasmid was further confirmed by experi-
ments using E. coli J53 Azir as the recipient strain. Plasmid DNA
was isolated using a Qiagen Plasmid Midi kit (Hilden, Germany)
and subjected to complete plasmid sequencing using Illumina
NextSeq as described previously (6). Sequencing reads were as-
sembled de novo using SPAdes software (15), and gaps were closed
by Sanger sequencing as described previously (6, 16). The mcr-1-
harboring plasmid from E. coli MCR1_NJ (subsequently named
pMCR1-NJ-IncX4) was 33,395 bp in length and had 100% BLAST
query coverage and 99.6% nucleotide identity to conjugative plas-
mid pMCR1-IncX4 (GenBank accession no. KU761327), which
we previously described in CTX-M-55-producing E. coli and
NDM-5-producing K. pneumoniae strains from Chinese hospitals
(5, 6). The blaNDM-5-harboring plasmid (named pNDM5-NJ-
IncX3) was 39,520 bp in length and closely related (100% nu-
cleotide identity and 79% query coverage) to pNDM5-IncX3

Downloaded from 
 (accession no. KU761328), previously described in the two afore-
mentioned NDM-5-producing K. pneumoniae strains from China
(6). No other resistance genes besides mcr-1 and blaNDM-5 were
observed in plasmid pMCR1-NJ-IncX4 or pNDM5-NJ-IncX3, re-
spectively.
Strain MCR1_NJ was shown by MLST to be a single-locus
variant of ST405, associated with E. coli phylogroup D (17). ST405
is classified as one of the main extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli
(ExPEC) lineages (18), and is associated with the global spread of
extended-spectrum �-lactamases, most notably CTX-M-15 (18–
20). AmpC cephamycinases and NDM metallo-�-lactamases have
also been reported in ST405 (20), including NDM-1 (21) and
NDM-4 (22). Consequently, ST405 may also be involved in the
global dissemination of NDM-producing E. coli strains (22).
Moreover, whereas strain MCR1_NJ was susceptible to various
antibiotics,
including
gentamicin
and
trimethoprim-sulfa-
methoxazole, studies of ST405 strains from multiple countries
suggest that they are typically resistant to these as well (20). Wor-
risomely, ST405 has been frequently associated with community
onset urinary tract infections (23–25). Dissemination of mcr-1
within this global lineage may therefore contribute to further
spread of polymyxin resistance within ESBL- and carbapenemase-
producing E. coli (and other Enterobacteriaceae) strains.
In summary, we report the isolation and identification of an
E. coli strain harboring both mcr-1 and blaNDM-5 from urine of a
patient without recent travel outside the United States. This strain
was isolated in August 2014, highlighting an earlier presence of
mcr-1 within the region than previously known and raising the
likelihood of ongoing undetected transmission. Active surveil-
lance efforts involving all polymyxin- and carbapenem-resistant
organisms are imperative in order to determine mcr-1 prevalence
and prevent further dissemination.
