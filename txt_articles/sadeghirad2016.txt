Summary
Marketing of foods and beverages high in fat, sugar and salt are suggested to contribute
to poor dietary behaviours in children and diet-related diseases later in life. This system-
atic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials aimed to assess the effects of unhealthy
food and beverage marketing on dietary intake (grams or kilocalories) and dietary
preference (preference score or percentage of participants who selected specific
foods/beverages) among children 2 to 18years of age.
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO up to January 2015 for terms re-
lated to advertising, unhealthy foods or beverages among children. Randomized tri-
als that assessed the effects of unhealthy food and beverage marketing compared
with non-dietary advertisement or no advertisement in children were considered el-
igible. Two authors independently extracted information on study characteristics
and outcomes of interest and assessed risk of bias and the overall quality of evi-
dence using GRADE methodology. Meta-analysis was conducted separately for die-
tary intake and preference using a random-effects model.
We identified 29 eligible studies, of which 17 studies were included for meta-
analysis of dietary preference and nine for meta-analysis of dietary intake.
Almost half of the studies were at high risk of bias. Our meta-analysis showed that
in children exposed to unhealthy dietary marketing, dietary intake significantly in-
creased (mean difference [MD] = 30.4 kcal, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.9 to
57.9, and MD = 4.8 g, 95%CI 0.8 to 8.8) during or shortly after exposure to adver-
tisements. Similarly, children exposed to the unhealthy dietary marketing had a
higher risk of selecting the advertised foods or beverages (relative risk = 1.1, 95%
CI 1.0 to 1.2; P = 0.052). The evidence indicates that unhealthy food and beverage
marketing increases dietary intake (moderate quality evidence) and preference
(moderate to low quality evidence) for energy-dense, low-nutrition food and bever-
age. Unhealthy food and beverage marketing increased dietary intake and influ-
enced dietary preference in children during or shortly after exposure to
advertisements. © 2016 World Obesity

 Introduction
The rates of overweight and obesity among children are
rising worldwide (1,2). Obesity is one of the major predis-
posing factors of most non-communicable diseases, and it
is associated with a lower life expectancy (3,4). Unhealthy
diet and the food and beverage environment that perpetu-
ates poor dietary behaviours are suggested to play major
roles in the global obesity epidemic (5,6). In 2010,
unhealthy diet was the leading risk factor for death and dis-
ability globally (7,8).
There is increasing evidence that unhealthy food and bev-
erage marketing directed at children negatively impacts
their eating behaviours (9). The increasing prevalence of
obesity seems to further coincide with marked increases in
the food and beverage industry’s budget for marketing
aimed at children and youth (10), with data showing that
energy-dense, low-nutrient foods and beverages make up
the majority of commercially marketed products (9,10).
Regulating bodies and international health organizations
have
concluded
that
the
advertising
of
unhealthy
foods/beverages impacts children’s eating habits and may
be associated with the concurrent rise in childhood obesity
(11,12); nevertheless, governments in North America re-
main committed to industry self-regulation as the primary
approach to reduce child-directed marketing of energy-
dense, low-nutrient products, which, to date, has not been
effective (13,14).
Several systematic and narrative reviews on the effects of
child-oriented food and beverage promotion on diet, dietary
determinants and health have been published (11,15–17).
However, these reviews have mostly reviewed observational
or non-randomized experimental studies, and none have fo-
cused specifically on randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
We aimed to systematically review all RCTs involving chil-
dren aged 2 to 18 years that evaluated the impact of
unhealthy food and beverage marketing compared with
non-active control (e.g. TV programs or movies with toys
or non-food advertising) on dietary intake and preference.
Methods
Search strategy
In January 2015, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and
PsycINFO to identify studies published in English with the
criteria (i) the population (children and adolescents 2–
18 years of age); (ii) the intervention (unhealthy food or
non-alcoholic
beverages
advertising
delivered
through
TV/movie commercials, advergames [electronic games to
advertise a product and might be played online or offline]
or use of branded logos, packaging with licenced characters
or booklet/magazine advertisements); (iii) comparison (TV
programs or movies with toys or non-dietary advertising,
unbranded logos, plain packaging, watching regular TV
programs or a movies without advertising); (iv) the out-
comes (dietary intake or preference) and (v) methodology
(randomized trials, according to Cochrane definition and
criteria (18)). An a priori protocol for this study was not
published. No substantive changes were made to the study
design after inception. The search terms and strategies are
available in the Supporting Information (e-supp 1). We also
reviewed reference lists and bibliographies of all included
studies and related reviews for additional studies of
relevance.
Study selection
Two reviewers independently screened the titles and/or ab-
stracts of all identified studies and excluded those that were
clearly not relevant. Subsequently, the full text of the identi-
fied articles were collected and independently read to deter-
mine whether they met our eligibility criteria. Discrepancies
were resolved by consensus, or, if needed, by arbitration
from a senior author. We used the eligibility criteria listed
previously. We excluded studies or study arm(s) that exclu-
sively focused on healthy foods and beverages (fruits and
vegetables)
marketing.
If
in
the
article
marketed
foods/beverages were only named but not categorized as
healthy or unhealthy, we used the WHO definition of ‘un-
healthy foods/beverages’ as products high in energy, added
fat, added sugar or sodium (19).
Data abstraction and risk of bias assessment
Data were extracted independently and in duplicate. We ex-
tracted the data (i) general study information (author’s name,
publication year and study location); (ii) study population de-
tails (sample size, age and ratio of male vs. female); (iii) details
on the intervention and comparison (e.g. marketing method
including TV/movie advertisement, advergames and branded
foods/beverages), duration of exposure to the marketed
foods/beverages (eating opportunity and duration of advertis-
ing), test foods/beverages and type of foods/beverages pro-
vided for children to consume during or after the intervention
(e.g. potato chips, candy and soda pop) and (iv) dietary intake
in grammes or kilocalories (kcal) and foods/beverages prefer-
ence score or percentage of participants who selected specific
foods/beverages.
Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias
instrument (20). Among eligible studies, two reviewers inde-
pendently assessed the following risk of bias issues: random
sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of
study participants, blinding of outcome assessors, incom-
plete outcome data and other potential sources of bias.
Studies were considered at high risk of bias when at least
three items were assessed as high risk of bias.

 The GRADE principles were applied to independently as-
sess the certainty (quality) of our pooled estimates using
the following criteria: risk of bias, consistency, directness,
imprecision and publication bias (21). The GRADE profiler
software (version 3.6) was used to prepare the summary of
finding table and to evaluate the quality of the evidence.
Any discrepancies in data extraction, risk of bias or quality
of evidence were resolved by consensus, and a third re-
searcher was consulted for advice when necessary.
Data synthesis and statistical methods
To compare the effects of unhealthy dietary marketing on
dietary intake and dietary preference, three measures of ef-
fect were used: mean difference, standardized mean differ-
ence (SMD) and relative risk (RR). We calculated the
mean difference and its corresponding 95% confidence in-
tervals (CIs) for dietary intake, reported as grammes or kcal
of foods/beverages consumed during or after the experi-
ments. To assess the dietary preferences, we calculated the
SMD and its corresponding 95%CIs. Dietary preference
was reported as the percentage of children who preferred
the experimental foods/beverages under study (all those in-
cluded in the dietary preference measure). We treated this
as a dichotomous variable (yes/no) and pooled eligible trials
using the RR and the corresponding 95%CIs.
Heterogeneity was determined using the Q statistic and I2.
A significance level of P < 0.10 for Cochran’s Q test or
I2 > 40% were considered as clinically important heterogene-
ity (18,22). We used the DerSimonian–Laird random-effects
model for meta-analysis. Regardless of the observed statisti-
cal heterogeneity, we conducted the following subgroup anal-
yses to explain any observed heterogeneity: age (8 years or
less vs. > 8 years of age), assuming a larger dietary intake in
older children; sex (boys vs. girls), assuming a larger intake
in boys; type of foods/beverages provided for children
(healthy vs. less healthy/unhealthy –foods/beverages high in
fat, sugar or salt), assuming a larger intake of less healthy/
unhealthy foods/beverages; and type of advertisement (TV
advertisement vs. advergames vs. branded logos/packaging

 with licenced characters), assuming a larger intake of
foods/beverages using TV advertisements. For any observed
or theoretical heterogeneity in pooled estimates of dietary in-
take, we also considered two more probable explanations:
duration of exposure to advertisements (5 min or less vs.
>5 min), assuming a larger intake in children with >5 min
exposure to advertisements, and duration of exposure to ex-
perimental foods/beverages for consumption (eating oppor-
tunity) during and/or after advertisement (15min or less vs.
>15 min), assuming an increased intake in children with
>15 min to consume the provided foods/beverages.
For subgroup analysis, we tested for interaction using a
chi-square significance test (23). For subgroups with more
than two variables and seven observations, we performed
meta-regression. If 10 or more studies were included in the
meta-analysis, publication bias was examined by funnel
plots and Begg’s and Mazumdar’s adjusted rank correlation
test (24). Data were analysed in STATA software version
11.0, Texas, USA.
Results
Description of included studies
Our literature search identified 2,468 titles and/or abstracts,
108 full texts were retrieved and screened. Of these, 79 stud-
ies were excluded after applying our eligibility criteria. The
main reasons for exclusion included (i) not being a random-
ized trial (n = 34); (ii) no child-directed marketing (n = 17)
and (iii) non-food/beverage marketing such as advertising
toys or cosmetics (n = 11). The stages of evaluation and ex-
clusion of the identified studies are presented in Fig. 1.
We identified 29 eligible RCTs enrolling a total of 5,814
children. Of these, three studies were excluded from our
meta-analyses because of insufficient outcome data (no data
provided on number of children randomized, or no data on
measures of variability) and different duration of interven-
tion (repeated exposure to advertisements for more than a
week) (25–27). The majority of studies were performed in
North America (n = 20). Studies most frequently examined
the impact of TV advertising (12 studies), followed by li-
cenced characters/logos (nine studies) and advergames (six
studies). Two studies looked at the effects of advertising in
magazines/booklets. The median for the mean age of partic-
ipants in the included studies was 8.2 years (interquartile
range (IQR) = 5.6 to 9.5). The median sample size among in-
cluded studies was 105 participants (IQR = 65 to 261). A de-
tailed description of included studies is presented in Table 1.
We identified 17 studies eligible for meta-analysis on die-
tary preference and nine for meta-analysis on dietary intake.
The quality of reporting among the included studies was
poor, with half of the included studies assessed as high risk
of bias. Based on the full text of included studies, the main
reasons for assessing studies as high risk of bias included
poor reporting with respect to allocation concealment and
blinding of participants and data assessors. Four of the nine
studies on dietary intake were rated as high risk of bias,
while 9 of 17 studies reporting dietary preference were rated
at high risk of bias (Table 1).
Effects of unhealthy food/beverage marketing on dietary
intake
Dietary intake (kilocalories)
Of the nine studies included in our meta-analysis on dietary
intake, four studies reported dietary intake in grammes
(28,29,40,41) while five studies reported intake data in kcal
(36–38,42,44). We were able to convert food intake in
grammes to kcal of food intake in only one study (28).
Among the six studies (665 participants) providing data
on dietary intake in kcal, the average time children were
exposed to marketing was 3.8 min (median: 3.8 min) and
the average time they were given to consume the food was
17.3 min (median: 17.5 min). Among the six included stud-
ies, the pooled estimate showed a significant increase of
30.4 kcal (95%CI 2.9 to 57.9) favouring exposure to un-
healthy dietary advertising vs. non-dietary advertising
(I2 = 72.0%; Fig. 2).
The results for our seven subgroups are as follows.
Among the six identified studies evaluating dietary caloric
intake, in one study the intervention was TVadvertisements,
three used advergames and in the remaining two studies, fa-
miliar licenced-characters or logos were used as the inter-
vention. The pooled estimate of dietary intake reported as
kcal was not significantly different among the three catego-
ries (Table 2). Our subgroup analysis for risk of bias
revealed that the difference between the studies at high risk
of bias (n = 3) vs. low risk (n = 3) was significant (z = 2.4,
P = 0.016;
MD = 46.4 kcal,
95%CI
11.0
to
81.7
and
MD = �7.9 kcal, 95%CI �34.6 to 18.8, respectively), indi-
cating that more methodologically sound studies found a
stronger effect of advertising on caloric intake.
Children exposed to unhealthy dietary advertisements for
more than 5 min (n = 222) had less caloric intake than those
who were exposed ≤ 5 min (n = 265) (MD = 6.5 kcal, 95%CI
�25.8 to 38.8; I2 = 77.0%; and MD = 64.4 kcal, 95%CI
39.8 to 89.0; I2 = 0.0%). The test of interaction showed that
the difference between
two
estimates
was
significant
(z = 2.8, P = 0.005). Our subgroup analysis for duration of
exposure (eating opportunity) to unhealthy foods/beverages
showed that participants given <15 min (two studies) for
eating/drinking had more caloric intake than those given
≥15 min to eat/drink (four studies; Table 2), and the differ-
ence
between
two
estimates
was
significant
(z = 3.2,
P = 0.001).
In our subgroup analysis on type of foods/beverages pro-
vided, we found that when children were exposed to

 unhealthy advertisements they consumed more unhealthy
calories (n = 487; MD = 30.3 kcal, 95%CI 7.8 to 52.9,
I2 = 82.1%) than healthy calories (n = 236; MD = �2.7 kcal,
95%CI �27.9 to 22.6; I2 = 75.7%) and that the difference
between the two estimates was statistically significant
(z = 1.9, P = 0.051). With respect to baseline characteristics,
the mean difference of dietary intake as reported in kcal
among boys (n = 128) was 94.8 kcal (95%CI 77.0 to
112.5; I2 = 0.0%), while in girls (n = 160) it was �8.8 kcal
(95%CI �77.6 to 60.1; I2 = 60.1%) (Table 2), and the dif-
ference was significant (z = 2.9, P = 0.004). Results for our
subgroup analysis on age were not significantly different
(≤8 years MD = 43.0 kcal; 95%CI 1.4 to 84.7; >8 years
MD = 27.5 kcal; 95%CI �7.8 to 62.7, P for test of
interaction = 0.58).
Dietary intake (grammes)
Among the four studies (395 participants) assessing dietary
intake in grammes, the average time children were exposed
to the marketing was 6.9 min (median: 5.25 min) and aver-
age time they were given for eating was 19.3 min (median:
22.5 min). Our meta-analysis showed a significant increase
of 4.8 g (95%CI 0.8–8.8) among those exposed to un-
healthy dietary advertising (I2 = 31.6%; Fig. S1).
All four studies included in our pooled estimate for die-
tary intake as grammes employed TV advertisements as
the intervention. Results of subgroup analysis were similar
based on risk of bias, duration of exposure to advertise-
ments and duration of exposure (eating opportunity) to un-
healthy foods (Table 2). We had insufficient data to assess
subgroups based on quality of calories (healthy vs. less
healthy/unhealthy), sex or age.
For dietary intake reported as either kcal or grammes,
there were too few studies to assess the risk of publication
bias. The overall quality of evidence for dietary intake for
both estimates was moderate. We rated the quality of
evidence down from high to moderate because of indirect
evidence (dietary intake is a surrogate for more patient-
important outcomes such as weight gain and obesity). De-
tails of the overall quality of evidence are summarized in
the GRADE summary of findings in Table 5.
Effects of unhealthy dietary marketing on dietary
preference
Dietary preference scores
Of the 17 included studies on dietary preference, 12 trials
reported a food or taste preference score. Our meta-analysis
showed a small non-significant increased effect favouring
preference for unhealthy foods/beverages when accompa-
nied by advertising (SMD = 0.23, 95%CI �0.04 to 0.5;
I2 = 87.6%; Fig. S2). Results of the subgroup analysis
showed that dietary preference was not influenced by type
of advertisement, risk of bias and type of foods/beverages
provided to children (Table 3). The mean age of participants
in the eight RCTs (879 children) was ≤8 years, and their
preference for unhealthy foods/beverages showed a small
to moderate effect size (SMD = 0.46; 95%CI 0.21 to 0.72;
I2 = 72.7%), whereas in the four RCTs (n = 1,174) including
participants >8 years, their dietary preference for unhealthy
foods/beverages showed a small non-significant effect size
(SMD = �0.28; 95%CI �0.72 to 0.16; I2 = 19.5%). The test
for interaction was significant (z = 2.85, P = 0.004).
Food preference percentage
Of the 17 included studies on foods/beverages preference,
eight trials reported the percentage of children who pre-
ferred specific foods/beverages. Children exposed to un-
healthy foods/beverages marketing had a higher risk of
selecting the advertised products that were associated with
a familiar licenced-character/logo (RR = 1.1, 95%CI 1.0 to

 1.2; P = 0.052, I2 = 27.6%; Fig. S3). Subgroup analysis
based on types of advertising demonstrated no significant
difference, whereas studies with higher risk of bias and stud-
ies performed on children less than 8 years of age showed
significantly increased risk of selecting the advertised prod-
ucts. However, the test of interaction for all three subgroups
was non-significant (Table 4). We had insufficient data to
assess subgroups based on advertisement time, type of food
(unhealthy vs. healthy) and sex.
The funnel plot and the Begg’s and Mazumdar’s adjusted
rank correlation test for 12 studies reporting dietary prefer-
ence scores did not indicate evidence of publication bias
(Fig. S4). We did not test for publication bias among studies
that reported dietary preference as a percentage as only
eight studies were included. The overall quality of evidence
for dietary preference scores was low. We rated the quality
of evidence down because of risk of bias and unexplained
heterogeneity. The overall quality of evidence for dietary
preference reported as a percentage was moderate. We rated
down from high to moderate based on risk of bias issues
(Table 5)
Discussion
We identified 29 randomized trials evaluating the effects of
unhealthy food and beverage marketing involving almost
6,000 children aged 2–18 years. We found that exposure to
unhealthy food and beverage marketing increased children’s
dietary intake and influenced children’s dietary behaviours
during or shortly after exposure to advertisements. Our find-
ings were consistent across studies. That is, in 18 of 26 studies
amenable for meta-analysis, the mean dietary intake or pref-
erence was greater for the marketed dietary products than
non-marketed products.
Using GRADE methodology, the overall quality of evi-
dence for food intake in kcal (665 children) and food intake
in grammes (395 children) was moderate, meaning the true
effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect but
there is a possibility that it is different. Considering the short
average time children were exposed to the adverts (approx-
imately 5 min) and the nearly 30 kcal (4.5 g) increase in die-
tary intake over an average of 15 min, an association
between exposure to energy-dense, low-nutrition food and
beverage advertising and weight gain, obesity and other di-
etary related non-communicable diseases is plausible. Al-
though results were non-significant with respect to food
and beverage preferences, among 1,648 children exposed
to energy-dense, low-nutrient products marketing, we
found an increased risk of selecting advertised foods or bev-
erages that were associated with a familiar licenced-
character or logos (moderate quality evidence). Similarly,
the food and beverage preference score among 2,053 chil-
dren showed a non-significant increased risk (low quality
evidence).
Our findings suggest that younger children (≤8 years of
age) might be more susceptible to the impact of food and
beverage marketing in terms of quantity and quality of cal-
ories consumed. Looking at subgroup analyses, the most
consistent finding suggested that younger children have in-
creased caloric intake, preference scores and often selected
unhealthy foods and beverages as compared with older chil-
dren. However, only preference scores were significant,
demonstrating that those ≤8 years of age had higher prefer-
ence scores than those >8 years. While children at the age of
2 or 3 are able to recognize familiar characters and identify
food and beverage products, they are less able to under-
stand the intention behind advertising and differentiate be-
tween program content and advertisements until the age of
7 or 8 (10,54). Thus, younger children might be more vul-
nerable to the influence of advertisements and associate
the marketed products with positive features of commercials
and subsequently try to imitate the behaviours they see.
Although we were only able to conduct a subgroup anal-
ysis based on sex for one of our four outcomes, our findings

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence:
High quality: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
Moderate quality: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
Low quality: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
Very low quality: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.
1Five of six trials had an unclear risk of bias because of lack of allocation concealment, and three of six trials had a high risk of bias because of lack of blinding of participants and/or assessors. However, given that
dietary intake is an objective outcome, we did not rate down for risk of bias.
2Substantial heterogeneity (I
2 72.0%) in the pooled estimate was observed. Results of our subgroup analyses on risk of bias, quality of calories and sex were significant, helping to explain the inconsistency.
3Considering that the dietary intake is a surrogate outcome for weight gain and other patient-important outcomes, we rated down for indirectness.
4Two of four trials had unclear risk of bias because of lack of allocation concealment and blinding of participants and/or assessors. However, given that dietary intake is an objective outcome, we did not rate down
for risk of bias.
5Six of 12 trials had an unclear risk of bias because of lack of allocation concealment, and eight of 12 trial had a high risk of bias because of lack of blindness of participants and/or assessors. Dietary preference is
a subjective, and many of the instruments used were unvalidated so we rated down for risk of bias.
6Given the substantial heterogeneity (I
2 87.6%) in the pooled estimate that was generally unexplained (three of four subgroups were non-significant; the subgroup on age was significant but both subgroups had I
2
values > 72%), we rated down for inconsistency.
7The majority of trials (six of eight) had an unclear or high risk of bias because of lack allocation concealment and blinding of participants and/or assessors, and given that this is a subjective measure, we rated
down for risk of bias

 further suggest that boys might be more susceptible to the
impact of food and beverage marketing in terms of caloric
intake. Girls may have a higher tendency towards dieting
practices possibly as a result of maternal encouragements
to be thin (42,44) that may have suppressed their natural re-
sponse (55). It has also been suggested that boys may be
more vulnerable when exposed to external cues for food
and beverage advertisements and therefore may consume
more than girls (55,56). Another explanation for the ob-
served difference between boys and girls might be that
child-targeted and adolescent-targeted food and beverage
advertisements tend to focus on boys perhaps because they
are more susceptible to external cues of food advertisements
(57,58).
It is important to note that advergames differ from TVad-
vertising in several key ways (active vs. passive reception,
low vs. high interactivity while exposed to the brand, expo-
sure time) (55,56). In comparing the subgroups (TV adver-
tisement, advergames and using familiar characters/logo),
our analysis showed no significant difference in children’s
dietary intake or preference among different types of mar-
keting. This might be due to the small number of included
studies. In addition, none of the identified trials directly
compared the effects of advergames with TV advertising in
terms of dietary intake or preference.
Subgroup analysis of included studies according to the
time children were exposed to the advertisements (≤5 min
vs. >5 min) and the time they were given to eat (<15 min
vs. ≥ 15 min) showed that those exposed to less marketing
and those who had less time to consume had higher intakes.
These findings were counter-intuitive; however, studies that
exposed children >5 min of advertisements or provided
≥15 min to consume tended to have higher risk of bias and
were more likely to provide more energy-dense foods
(28,38,42,44). These findings may also be due to chance
given the sparse number of studies included in the analysis
or the fact that children may have gorged the energy-dense
snacks at the beginning of each study given that they had
limited time.
Four systematic reviews have investigated the effects of
food and beverage marketing to children, three of these be-
ing technical reports from authoritative bodies such as the
World Health Organization (WHO) (14–16,28). While
largely based on evidence from observational studies, each
review concluded that the marketing and promotion of
foods and beverages high in fat, sugar and/or salt have a
negative impact on children’s nutrition preferences, pur-
chase behaviour, consumption patterns and diet-related
health. A recent meta-analysis showed that acute exposure
to food and beverage advertising is associated with greater
food intake in children (57); however, they combined ran-
domized and non-randomized trials and did not assess risk
of bias or the quality in evidence using the GRADE approach.
Further, Boyland et al. (57) included only 13 studies in their
meta-analysis, while we included 26 RCTs. While not con-
clusive, the findings from this review contribute to the grow-
ing body of research suggesting that the marketing of
energy-dense, low-nutrition foods and beverages to children
contribute to unhealthy dietary choices, which puts children
at risk for diet-related diseases later in life.
This paper has a number of noted limitations. First, using
the GRADE approach the overall quality of evidence for the
effects of food and beverage advertising on dietary intake
and preference was low to moderate quality. The quality
of evidence was impacted primarily because of lack of
reporting of allocation concealment, blinding of outcome
assessors and participants and the unavailability of study
protocols that were substantial among included articles,
limiting the overall certainty in evidence. Second, the in-
cluded studies examined responses to acute advertising ex-
posure only. The collective effects of continued exposure
to food and beverage marketing that occurs in real life and
over a lifetime may differ. Third, the designs of these inter-
ventions (being conducted in laboratory setting rather than
in real-life situations) may be different from the typical daily
exposure to advertising children are subjected to.
Implications for public health policy
A recent global study spanning 13 countries revealed that
children are exposed to an average of five food advertise-
ments per hour with unhealthy ‘non-core’ foods accounting
for greater than 80% of all televised food advertisements in
Canada, the United States and Germany (58). Collectively,
the evidence linking children’s exposure to unhealthy food
and beverage marketing to poor dietary behaviours and in-
creased risk of overweight and obesity has sparked global
debate. Results of a recent modelling study suggested that
a ban on television advertising of foods high in fat, sugar
and/or salt could reduce overweight and obesity in child-
hood by 18% and 2.5%, respectively (54,59). Given the po-
tential impact on children’s health, in 2010 the WHO
released a set of recommendations urging member states to
restrict the marketing of foods and beverages high in satu-
rated fats, trans-fats, added sugar and salt to children (12).
Voluntary self-monitoring by industry and inadequate nutri-
tional standards for defining healthy/unhealthy dietary
products and the lack of government monitoring and over-
sight remain key flaws to recent initiatives and likely ac-
count for the lack of reduction in child-targeted marketing
for unhealthy foods and beverages (13,60–62).
Conclusions
The evidence indicates that unhealthy food and beverage
marketing increases dietary intake and preference for
energy-dense, low-nutrition products in children during or
shortly after exposure to advertisements. Further research

erage advertising on daily and weekly dietary intake and
choices. Overall, our analyses support the need for a review
of public policy on child-targeted unhealthy food and bever-
age marketing.

Figure S1. Forest plot showing the weighted mean difference
in food intake (grammes) between unhealthy food and non-
food marketing groups. Horizontal bars denote 95% CIs.
Studies are represented as squares centred on the point
estimate of the result of each study. The area of the square
represents the weight given to the study in the meta-analysis
by STATA software. The pooled mean difference was calcu-
lated by DerSimonian–Laird (D + L) random-effects model
inverse variance (I-V) fixed-effects model. The diamond rep-
resents the overall estimated effect and its 95% CIs (centre
line of diamond, dashed line). The solid vertical line is the
line of no effect.
Figure S2. Forest plot showing the standardized mean differ-
ence (SMD) in food/taste preference between unhealthy
food marketing and control groups. Horizontal bars denote
95% CIs. Studies are represented as squares centred on the
point estimate of the result of each study. The area of the
square represents the weight given to the study in the
meta-analysis by STATA software. The pooled standardized
mean difference was calculated by a random-effects model.
The diamond represents the overall estimated effect and its
95% CIs in each subgroup and in total (centre line of dia-
mond, dashed line). The solid vertical line is the line of no
effect.
Figure S3. Forest plot showing relative risk (RR) for un-
healthy food marketing vs. control groups. Horizontal bars
denote 95% CIs. Studies are represented as squares centred
on the point estimate of the result of each study. The area of
the square represents the weight given to the study in the
meta-analysis by STATA software. The pooled RR was calcu-
lated by DerSimonian–Laird (D + L) random-effects model
Mantel–Hansel (M-H) fixed-effects model. The diamond
represents the overall estimated effect and its 95% CIs in to-
tal (centre line of diamond, dashed line). The solid vertical
line is the line of no effect.
Figure S4, Funnel plot of studies included in the meta-
analysis food preference. The standardized mean difference
(SMD) is plotted on the x-axis, and the standard error
(SE) of the SMD is plotted on the y-axis. Each point in the
plot represents a study and its effect estimate; the shape of
a symmetrical funnel suggests the absence of publication
bias.
