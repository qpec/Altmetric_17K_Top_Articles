As the opioid epidemic in the United States has continued 
since the early 2000s (1,2), most descriptions have focused 
on misuse and deaths. Increased cooperation with state and 
local partners has enabled more rapid and comprehensive 
surveillance of nonfatal opioid overdoses (3).* Naloxone 
administrations obtained from emergency medical services 
(EMS) patient care records have served as a useful proxy for 
overdose surveillance in individual communities and might 
be a previously unused data source to describe the opioid 
epidemic, including fatal and nonfatal events, on a national 
level (4–6). Using data from the National Emergency Medical 
Services Information System (NEMSIS),† the trend in rate of 
EMS naloxone administration events from 2012 to 2016 was 
compared with opioid overdose mortality rates from National 
Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files. 
During 2012–2016, the rate of EMS naloxone administration 
events increased 75.1%, from 573.6 to 1004.4 administra-
tions per 100,000 EMS events, mirroring the 79.7% increase 
in opioid overdose mortality from 7.4 deaths per 100,000 
persons to 13.3. A bimodal age distribution of patients receiv-
ing naloxone from EMS parallels a similar age distribution of 
deaths, with persons aged 25–34 years and 45–54 years most 
affected. However, an accurate estimate of the complete injury 
burden of the opioid epidemic requires assessing nonfatal 
overdoses in addition to deaths. Evaluating and monitoring 
nonfatal overdose events via the novel approach of using EMS 
data might assist in the development of timely interventions 
to address the evolving opioid crisis.
NEMSIS Public Release Research data sets from 2012 
through 2016 were used for this analysis. Approximately 
10,000 EMS agencies and 49 U.S. states and territories 
contribute data to the NEMSIS National EMS Database, 
resulting in a national convenience sample of EMS events 
(7). EMS naloxone administration events were defined as the 
administration of at least 1 naloxone dose during EMS patient 
care. EMS events for this evaluation included 9-1-1 responses, 
responses during special event coverage, and provision of care 
by EMS crew in an ambulance intercept§ or during mutual

aid to another ambulance response.¶ Those events in which 
opioid analgesics were administered by EMS, where no patient 
was found by the responding EMS crew, or where the event 
was a medical transport or interfacility transfer were excluded. 
Because the focus of this evaluation was on rates of naloxone 
administration events as a proxy to opioid overdoses, rather 
than severity of overdoses, multiple naloxone dosing was not 
considered. Administration of naloxone by EMS is the standard 
of care for many EMS systems in the prehospital setting for 
patients in cardiac arrest and those who are unconscious. Thus, 
recognizing that not all naloxone administrations by EMS 
represent actual opioid overdoses, a subanalysis of suspected 
overdoses, defined as the subset of EMS events with naloxone 
administration and documented evidence of drug ingestion/
poisoning,** was conducted to obtain the potential range of 
actual opioid overdoses treated by EMS. The primary outcome 
examined was the annual rate of naloxone administration per 
100,000 EMS events with a secondary analysis of trends in 
patient characteristics. Chi-squared tests of linear trend were 
used to compare data across the 5 yearly time points (2012 to 
2016) along with the percent increase over this period.
The estimated rate of EMS naloxone administration was 
compared with opioid overdose mortality rates reported in 
CDC’s National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death 
mortality files during 2012–2016.†† Following the methodol-
ogy used in past work used to describe drug overdose mortal-
ity (2), opioid-involved deaths during the study period, with 
 ¶ All EMS events in the NEMSIS Public Release Research Dataset for the years 
2012 through 2016 were included in the study population. Naloxone 
administration was ascertained by “Medication Given (NEMSIS data element 
E18_03) = Naloxone or Naloxone Hydrochloride.” EMS patients who were 
administered an opioid analgesic (morphine, morphine sulfate, fentanyl, 
hydromorphone, or hydromorphone hydrochloride) by EMS and subsequently 
administered naloxone were not included. Events were included if the variable 
“Type of Service Requested (E02_04)” was “9-1-1 Response,” and response 
options were the following: “Scene (field value = 30),” “Intercept (35),” 
“Mutual Aid (50),” and “Standby (55),” excluding events with “Interfacility 
Transfer (40)” or “Medical Transport (45).” Events with “Incident/Patient 
Disposition (E20_10)” field values of “Cancelled (4815)” or “No Patient 
Found (4825)” and those that occurred in the U.S. territories of Guam (66) 
and the U.S. Virgin Islands (78) identified under “EMS Agency State 
(D01_03),” were also excluded from the study population.
 
** EMS records were included if any of the following were documented as drug 
ingestion, poisoning, or overdose: “complaint reported by dispatch (E03_01, 
field value = 510),” “EMS provider’s primary impression (E09_15, 1690),” 
“EMS provider’s secondary impression (E09_16, 1825),” and “cause of injury 
(E10_01, 9530).”

underlying causes of death related to poisoning with a multiple 
cause of death involving opioids, were queried by year.§§
From 2012 to 2016, a stepwise increase occurred in the 
number of EMS events with naloxone administration (Table 1). 
The increase persisted in the subset of suspected overdoses, 
EMS naloxone administrations with documented evidence 
of a drug ingestion/poisoning (Table 2). During 2012–2016, 
the rate of naloxone administration events overall increased 
75.1%, from 573.6 to 1,004.4 administrations per 100,000 
EMS events (Table 2), and the rate of naloxone administration 
in suspected overdoses increased 119.0%, from 230.6 to 505.2. 
Concomitant with the increase in naloxone administration 
rates was a 79.7% increase in age-adjusted opioid mortality 
rate, from 7.4 deaths per 100,000 persons in 2012 to 13.3 in 
2016 (Table 2).
A bimodal distribution was observed in the age groups of 
patients who received naloxone during EMS events, with 
modes at ages 25–34 years and 45–54 years (Table 1) (Figure). 
In 2012, a larger proportion of naloxone administration events 
occurred among persons aged 45–54 years (19.8%, 18,049) 
than among persons aged 25–34 years (17.2%, 15,686, 
p<0.001). By 2016, this finding had reversed, and a larger

persons aged 25–34 years (21.2%, 35,179) than among per-
sons aged 45–54 years (17.7%, 29,491, p<0.001). A similar 
bimodal age distribution was also identified in opioid overdose 
deaths from 2012 to 2016, mirroring the two modes observed 
in EMS data (Figure).
Discussion
This cross-sectional evaluation of the large NEMSIS Public 
Release Research data sets from 2012 to 2016 demonstrated 
that the increase in the rate of all naloxone administration by 
EMS parallels the increase in rate of fatal opioid overdoses. 
As proposed, examining naloxone administrations by EMS 
professionals might be a useful and timely tool to gauge the 
comprehensive prevalence of opioid overdoses, including those 
that do not end in a fatal event. EMS data regarding naloxone 
administration can be used by health care organizations and 
communities to benchmark the performance of interventions 
over time and compare with national averages, as well as assist 
in the development of timely interventions.
This analysis also demonstrated a bimodal age distribution 
in both naloxone administrations by EMS and opioid overdose 
deaths. Further, a trend of increasing naloxone administra-
tions and deaths in younger persons (aged 25–34 years) was 
observed. The reasons for these findings are difficult to discern 
from these data. Whereas efforts have been increased to control 
access to and misuse of prescription opioid pain relievers, use of

illicit opioids such as fentanyl is increasing (8,9). Use of heroin 
and illicitly manufactured fentanyl is associated with younger 
age groups (9,10). This change from misuse of prescription 
opioid pain relievers to highly potent illicit opioids offers a 
plausible explanation for the increased prevalence of naloxone 
administration by EMS and deaths in the younger age group. 
However, rates of drug overdose deaths have increased in all 
age groups, with convergence of these rates for those aged 
25–34, 35–44, and 45–54 years.¶¶ As this prevalence of disease 
changes, there is a potential impact on years of life lost caused 
by opioid overdose in the United States.
The novel use of EMS naloxone administration data to 
examine nonfatal overdoses, in conjunction with mortality 
and emergency department data (3), provides a more robust 
picture of the burden of injury for opioid overdose epidemic. 
The overall rate of naloxone administration increased by 75.1% 
from 2012 to 2016. In the subgroup analysis of suspected over-
dose events, the increase was even higher (119.0%), suggesting 
that EMS providers are increasingly more likely to administer 
naloxone in borderline cases. Because these patients represent 
a population still at risk for overdose and death, more work is 
needed to understand nonfatal overdose events.

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, this analysis focused on naloxone administered 
by EMS personnel in a large convenience sample of EMS 
records. The accuracy and completeness of data entered into 
the NEMSIS Public Release Research data set are dependent on 
correct and thorough entries by EMS personnel. The accuracy 
of these data are unknown, limiting the ability to assess the 
rate of naloxone use by laypersons and non-EMS personnel. 
Second, naloxone use by laypersons or other first responders, 
including law enforcement, without activation of the EMS 
system is not reflected in these data sets. Third, variations 
in EMS record documentation submitted to the NEMSIS 
National EMS Database might present a potential misclassifica-
tion bias. Fourth, because these data were deidentified, it was 
not possible to assess naloxone administration over repeated 
events. Although the increased use of potent illicit opioids has

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Naloxone administration data from emergency medical services 
(EMS) records have been used for surveillance for opioid 
overdoses on a local level.
What is added by this report?
Analysis of a national database of EMS events found that from 
2012 to 2016, the rate of naloxone administrations increased 
75.1%, from 573.6 to 1004.4 per 100,000 EMS events, mirroring a 
79.7% increase in the age-adjusted opioid mortality rate.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Monitoring nonfatal overdose events using EMS records 
provides a more complete evaluation of the potential injury 
burden and a means of benchmarking for communities and 
EMS agencies to better address the evolving opioid epidemic.
resulted in multiple naloxone administrations during many 
EMS events (6), multiple naloxone administrations and dos-
ages of naloxone given by EMS were not assessed. Finally, 
because this was a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data, 
causality cannot be inferred.
Evaluating and monitoring nonfatal overdose events might 
assist in the development of more timely emergency response 
interventions, more naloxone administrations in suspected 
drug overdose cases, and referral to treatment and care coordi-
nation. EMS agencies and their communities can also compare 
naloxone administrations with national benchmarks to evaluate 
the effectiveness of interventions. EMS data are useful for iden-
tifying populations at risk, such as those surviving an opioid 
overdose, and could assist in meeting the challenge of decreas-
ing the mortality impact of the opioid epidemic. Further, these 
results support widening the scope of discussion concerning 
opioid epidemic overdoses and demonstrate the importance 
of EMS providers in providing a more complete evaluation of 
opioid overdose injury burden in the United States.
