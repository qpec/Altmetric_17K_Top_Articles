Previous literature reports that obese persons are discriminated in the workplace.
Evidence suggests that obese people are perceived as having less leadership potential,
and in comparison to normal weight peers, are expected to be less successful.
This study examined whether obese people are discriminated against when applying
for employment. Three hypotheses were offered in line with previous research: (1)
obese people are less likely to be assessed positively on personnel suitability than
normal weight people; (2) obese people in active employment are more likely to be
discriminated against than people in non-active employment; and (3) obese women are
more likely to be discriminated against than obese men. 181 Participants were sampled
from sedentary, standing, manual and heavy manual occupations. Participants rated
hypothetical candidates on their suitability for employment. Employees also completed
measures of implicit and explicit attitudes toward obesity. MANOVA was conducted
to examine if obese candidates were discriminated against during the recruitment
procedure. Results demonstrated that participants rated obese candidates as less
suitable compared with normal weight candidates and when the weight status of the
candidate was not revealed for work across the four workplace groups. Participant
gender and weight status also impacted perceptions of candidates’ suitability for work
and discrimination toward obese candidates was higher in participants from more
physically demanding occupations. The study findings contribute to evidence that obese
people are discriminated against in the hiring process and support calls for policy
development.

INTRODUCTION
Worldwide prevalence of obesity has increased with approximately half a billion people currently
classed as obese (Body Mass Index ≥ 30 kg.m2; World Health Organization, 2015). Concurrently,
there has been an increase in the stigmatization and discrimination of obesity (Latner and
Stunkard, 2003). A number of institutions contribute to the development and maintenance of
anti-fat attitudes in particular the media, such as television or written press (Latner et al., 2007;

Flint et al.
Obesity Discrimination in the Workplace
Flint et al., 2016). The discourse used in the media when
reporting on obesity represents an attempt to create concern and
a ‘
moral panic’
and in doing so leads to an emotional response
in the recipient (Rich and Evans, 2005; Tischner and Malson,
2008). Indeed, the reach and influence of these institutions is
wide and as such, obesity stigmatization has been reported in
various population groups: jurors (Schvey et al., 2013), healthcare
professionals (Carr and Friedman, 2005; Brown et al., 2007),
educational professionals (Puhl and Heuer, 2009), and obesity
researchers (Flint and Reale, 2014). Consequently, research has
identified that there are settings where obesity stigmatization
and discrimination may occur such as in schools (Puhl and
Luedicke, 2012), public spaces including waiting rooms and
public transport (Puhl and Brownell, 2001), and in the workplace
(Flint and Snook, 2014).
Research investigating obesity discrimination in the workplace
has examined the stereotypes reported about obese employees
and how these may translate to discriminative behaviors. Both
experimental and survey research suggest that employment
discrimination against overweight individuals is substantial in
Western cultures (see Roehling, 1999, for an extensive review).
More specifically, Levine and Schweitzer (2015) found that
people with obesity were associated with low competence, whilst
Schulte et al. (2007) reported that obese people receive lower
starting salaries, are ranked as less qualified, and work longer
hours than normal weight employees. Similarly, Ball et al.
(2002) suggested that obesity and high BMI are associated with
employment in jobs associated with lower socioeconomic status.
There are also reports of discrimination at the hiring stage, where
obese candidates are assessed having less leadership potential, are
less likely to be employed, and are expected to be less successful
compared to normal weight peers (Flint and Snook, 2014).
Moreover, Agerström and Rooth (2011) reported that managers
held negative automatic stereotypes about obese people and were
less likely to invite an obese applicant for an interview.
In the hiring process, a number of additional factors have been
reported to have an impact on obesity discrimination, such as the
candidate’
s gender and the requirements of the job. Specifically,
obese women were almost three times more likely to report
discrimination than obese men (Roehling et al., 2007). Bartels and
Nordstrom (2013) suggested that obese women are more likely to
be discriminated against than obese men when applying for a job,
especially if the job requires high visibility and physical demands.
Previous research and theory, such as the Objectification Theory
(Fredrickson and Roberts, 1997) suggests that unlike men,
women are subjected to sexual objectification and assessment
against beauty standards. Fredrickson and Roberts argue that
the objectification of women is harmful to women and this
explains why women are judged more harshly compared to men
in many spheres of life including employment discrimination. It
is suggested that people are socialized into objectifying women
based on beauty standards with a plethora of examples evident in
current society such as in the media.
Bartels and Nordstrom (2013) provide the most recent
evidence regarding obesity discrimination in the hiring process
whilst assessing gender and the physical requirements of
employment. However, there were methodological shortcomings
of Bartels and Nordstrom’
s (2013) study that the current study
aimed to improve on. First, Bartels and Nordstrom’
s (2013) study
only examined perceived suitability of a hypothetical candidate
when weight status was revealed. Thus, the weight status of
candidates was always revealed in their study which is not always
the case when applying for employment and unlikely in countries
where a picture of the candidate is not a required element of a
CV. The current study aimed to compare the perceived suitability
of candidates whose weight status was not revealed. Second,
as acknowledged by Bartels and Nordstrom (2013), in their
study participants rated only one potential candidate per position
which is also unlikely in a real hiring process, where typically a
range of candidates are assessed. Third, Bartels and Nordstrom
(2013) only examined explicit anti-fat attitudes, despite previous
research (e.g., Flint et al., 2015a) suggesting implicit measures
are a strong predictor of anti-fat attitudes. Finally, only 44% of
participants were employed and 45% had experience of recruiting
employees in Bartels and Nordstrom’
s (2013) study.
Unemployment is a longstanding topic of concern across
the world, with research linking unemployment with poorer
outcomes such as increased likelihood of health disparities (Adler
and Newman, 2002). Reports of obesity discrimination in the
hiring process have led to calls for the development and review
of legislation to protect obese people from discrimination (Flint
and Snook, 2015).
In 2014, the European Court of Justice ruled that being
severely overweight could be considered a disability if it
significantly disrupted an employee’
s ability to work. In the US,
there are states that have laws to protect against height and weight
discrimination, whilst UK and EU employment law is lagging
and is yet to include discrimination toward overweight and obese
people. The main problem with the existing anti-discrimination
laws is that they require interpretation of an individual’
s
(dis)ability to work, as well as of the necessary adjustments
that may be required to accommodate a person’
s needs (Flint
and Snook, 2014). Anti-discrimination laws are included in
legislation such as The UK Equality Act (2010) and EU laws in
The Employment Equality Directive (2007/78). For example, The
UK Equality Act (2010) specifically prohibits discrimination on
the grounds of age, disability, gender re-assignment, marriage
and civil partnership, pregnancy, maternity, race, ethnicity,
religion, belief, sex, and sexual orientation. In considering current
anti-discrimination legislation and thus protection for obese
people from discrimination, whether obesity is defined as a
disability is the key consideration. For example, obesity is not
specified as a disabling condition in The UK Equality Act (2010).
Thus, through interpretation, an obese person who experiences
discrimination in recruitment or in the workplace such as
being overlooked for a job or promotion may not be protected
by current legislation. Consequently, misunderstandings and
misinterpretations of obesity may lead to stereotyping and
discriminative behaviors in the workplace.
The hiring process in employment is clearly an area that
warrants further examination given that previous research
suggests obese people experience discrimination when applying
for work, and the implications of unemployment which continues
to be a global concern. Thus the aim of the present study

Obesity Discrimination in the Workplace
was to identify whether obese people are discriminated against
when applying for employment and by doing so improve
on the methodological limitation of previous research. In
line with previous research identified above, three hypotheses
were formulated: (1) obese candidates will be assessed as less
suitable for employment than normal weight candidates; (2)
obese candidates are more likely to be discriminated against
when applying for employment in active working environments
compared to non-active environments; and (3) obese women are
more likely to be discriminated against than obese men.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Hundred and eighty one employees (107 male, 74 female) in
employment varying in levels of physical demand (sedentary,
standing, manual work and heavy manual work) took part in
the study. All participants were fluent in English and sampled
from three European countries: Czech Republic, Slovenia,
and the UK. There was no compensation or incentives for
participating in the experiment. Using a convenience sample
of workplaces, employees responded to requests received via
email for participation to take part in the study. Workplaces
were selected that corresponded to the activity levels as stated
in European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition
physical activity questionnaire (EPIC, Wareham et al., 2003).
Participants had to have had previous experience of recruiting
employees to the workplace.
Materials
A range of implicit and explicit measures were used to assess
anti-fat attitudes and beliefs about the controllability of obesity:
Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald et al., 1998), Attitudes
Toward Obese Persons scale (ATOP; Allison et al., 1991), Beliefs
About Obese Persons scale (BAOP; Allison et al., 1991), and
F-scale (Bacon et al., 2001).
The IAT (Greenwald et al., 1998) is a computer-based
measure of implicit attitudes which was modified in this study
to assess attitudes toward fatness and thinness. Scores range
between −2 and 2 with positive scores indicative of implicit anti-
fat or pro-thin preference. The seven block IAT will be employed
as described by Greenwald et al. (2003, see Table 1). The quicker
participants assign stimuli to the grouping categories in blocks 4
and 7, the stronger implicit attitude toward the pairings. Previous
research (e.g., Greenwald et al., 1998) has reported satisfactory
internal consistency with Cronbach’
s alpha ranging from of 0.7
to 0.9.
The ATOP (Allison et al., 1991) measures both positive
and negative attitudes toward obese people. The scale has
20 items that are measured on a six-point Likert scale (+3
to −3) for each statement. Scores range from 0 to 120 with

higher scores indicative of more positive attitudes toward obese
persons. Previous research (e.g., Allison et al., 1991) has reported
satisfactory internal consistency with Cronbach’
s alpha scores
ranging between 0.65 and 0.83.
The BAOP (Allison et al., 1991) measures the extent that an
individual believes that obesity is under an individual’
s control.
The scale contains eight items that are measured on a six-point
Likert scale (−3 to +3) for each statement. Overall scores range
from 0 to 48 with lower scores indicative of a stronger belief
obesity is controllable. Previous research (e.g., Allison et al., 1991)
has reported satisfactory internal consistency with Cronbach’
s
alpha scores ranging from 0.80 to 0.84.
The F-scale (Bacon et al., 2001) measures the extent that
respondents associate negative characteristics with being fat. The
14 item scale is measured on a five-point Likert scale where two
opposing attributes are presented together (e.g., 1 = Active to
5 = Lazy). Previous research (Bacon et al., 2001) has reported
satisfactory internal consistency with Cronbach’
s alpha scores
ranging from 0.87 to 0.91 in different samples.
Six hypothetical candidate CVs were developed (a male and
female normal weight, obese, and no photo CV) that were
modified for the four physical activity levels of the workplace as
identified in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer
and Nutrition physical activity questionnaire (EPIC; Riboli et al.,
2002). Thus, the hypothetical candidates were applying to four
different employment offers (one for each physical activity level).
For the sedentary workplace the advertised job offer was an
administrative assistant, for the standing workplace a university
lecturer, for the manual workplace a retail salesperson and for the
heavy manual workplace a laborer. The advertised jobs were at
early career level and thus CVs were a maximum of two pages in
length to standardize across workplace.
All CV were developed to match the requirements of
existing employment opportunities resulting in highly competent
candidates. Thus, none of the hypothetical candidates could be
rejected based on insufficient professional experience or skills.
The content of the CVs was standardized including basic contact
information, education, personal and professional experience
with variation across four workplaces (e.g., academic CV had
list of selected publication). CVs were randomly allocated and
counterbalanced for gender and weight status such that each
participant rated two normal weight CVs (one male, one female),
two obese CVs (one male, one female) and two CVs without
a photo (one male, one female). The sex of the participants
was indicated by the name of the applicant. Common British
male or female only names were used (i.e., no unisex names) to
avoid any confusion regarding the gender of the CVs without a
picture.
A Personnel Suitability scale was developed for the study
comprised of seven items that aimed to measure the participants’
evaluation of the hypothetical candidates. Qualities assessed
on a seven-point Likert scale included: team-work ability,
social competence, job efficiency, intelligence, motivation, and
leadership skills. One question explicitly inquired whether the
candidate was considered to be suitable for the job. A cumulative
score of all items was calculated, thus scores for the scale range
from 0 to 42.
Procedure
This study received institutional ethical approval from the
Faculty of Health and Wellbeing, Sheffield Hallam University;
Department of Psychology, Charles University; Department of
Psychology University of Bath; and Department of Psychology,
University
of
Maribor.
All
participants
provided
written
informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Participants
were
recruited
from
four
workplace
environments that require different levels of activity (sedentary,
standing, manual work and heavy manual work) as measured
by the EPIC (Riboli et al., 2002). Each participant evaluated the
job suitability of six hypothetical candidates based on their CV,
before completing the IAT (Greenwald et al., 1998), the ATOP
and BAOP (Allison et al., 1991), and the F-scale (Bacon et al.,
2001). Participants only rated hypothetical candidates who were
applying for employment in a workplace that corresponded with
their own workplace. Demographic data about the participants
was also collected. All participants rated the suitability of each
CV prior to the implicit and explicit measures in order to avoid
revealing the topic of enquiry to participants. The implicit
and explicit measures were completed in a counter-balanced
order. On completion of the test, all participants were debriefed
regarding the full aim of the experiment.
Analysis
A repeated measures Multivariate Analyses of Variance with
Within-Subject gender (male, female) and photo (normal, obese,
no photo) and between subject workplaces (sedentary, standing,
manual and heavy manual) was conducted. Where significant
interactions were found, follow-up ANOVAs were conducted.
The model was a composite of Photo × Gender × Workplace.
Repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to assess whether
obese candidates were less likely to be assessed positively on
personnel suitability scales than normal weight candidates. The
test compared suitability scores of the photo condition (obese,
normal, and no photo) as a within subject variable, and whether
obese women are more likely to be discriminated against than
obese men a repeated measures ANOVA was conducted.
RESULTS
Descriptive Statistics
Participants were aged 24–
60 years (M = 38.25, SD = 8.99)
with a mean BMI of 25.9 kg.m2 (SD = 3.39). Age distribution
was slightly left skewed with higher frequency of younger
participants. Distribution across level of physical activity in the
workplace was 43 in sedentary occupation (19 males), 56 in
standing occupation (35 males), 47 in manual work occupation
(24 males), and 35 in heavy manual work occupation (29 males).
Mean scores on for the hypothetical candidates’suitability for
work demonstrated that both males and females perceived the
normal weight male as the most suitable for employment (39.73
and 38.38 out of 42 respectively) and the obese female as the least
suitable for employment (22.39 and 24.65 out of 42 respectively;
see Table 1). Overall, participants reported negative implicit
and explicit attitudes toward obesity and a belief that obesity is

Obesity Discrimination in the Workplace
controllable. Male participants from the heavy manual workforce
reported the most negative implicit and explicit attitudes toward
obesity with lower ATOP and BAOP scores, higher IAT and
F-scale scores (see Table 1). Participants sampled from the
heavy manual workplace also reported the strongest beliefs that
obesity is controllable than the other types of workplace (see
Table 1).
A number of correlations were apparent among the explicit
measures (see Figure 1). A positive correlation was found
between ATOP and BAOP scales indicating that more negative
attitudes toward obese persons were associated with a stronger
belief that obesity is controllable. A negative correlation was
found between the ATOP and F-scale and the BAOP and F-scale
meaning that stronger beliefs about the controllability of obesity
and negative attitudes toward obese people are associated with
greater fat phobia. There was also a positive correlation between
the IAT and F-scale indicating an association between negative
implicit anti-fat or pro-thin bias and greater fat phobia. Finally,
negative correlations were observed between the IAT and ATOP,
and IAT and BAOP, suggesting that more negative implicit
anti-fat or pro-thin bias are associated with more negative
attitudes toward obese people and stronger beliefs that obesity is
controllable.
Main Effects
Three statistically significant main effects and no statistically
non-significant effects resulted from initial MANOVA. The
largest effect size was measured for Photo [F(2,176) = 1950.97,
p < 0.001, η2
p = 0.957], followed by Gender [F(1,177) = 381.82,
p < 0.001, η2
p = 0.683] condition. Both of former variables are
Within-Subject. Main effect was also observed among Between-
Subject Workplace Setting variable [F(3,177) = 115.33, p < 0.001,
η2
p = 0.662].
Interactions
A significant three-way interaction was observed between
Gender × Photo × Workplace [F(6,354) = 12.39, p < 0.001,
η2
p = 0.17 see Figures 1 and 2]. There was also a significant two-
way interactions of Gender × Photo [F(2,176) = 59.50, p < 0.001,
η2
p = 0.40], Photo × Workplace [F(6,354) = 25.24, p < 0.001,
η2
p = 0.30] and Gender × Workplace [F(3,177) = 44.90,
p < 0.001, η2
p = 0.43]. These results demonstrate that the factors
in the model interact significantly.
FIGURE 2 | Three Way Interaction of Gender × Photo × Workplace
(male).
The three-way interaction shows that participants judged the
personnel suitability of the CVs with significantly different scores
depending on gender. Furthermore, the score was significantly
different across each of the workplaces with heavy manual
workplace interacting with the other workplaces. Hence, as
the activity level of the workplace increased, stigma toward
obese female candidates increased while normal weight male
candidates were perceived as more suitable. The two-way
interactions further confirm that male and female CVs were
judged significantly different when photo conditions were
manipulated, and that the CVs were judged differently based on
the photo conditions across workplace settings. Finally, personnel
suitability of the candidate was judged significantly different
across all workplaces based on gender. These results also indicate
that the manipulation has been effective (see Figures 2 and 3).
Personnel Suitability
To test Hypothesis 1, follow up repeated measures ANOVA
demonstrated that personnel suitability was judged significantly
different across Photo condition [F(1.49,268.57) = 1249,40,
p < 0.001, η2
p = 0.87]. Follow up pair-wise t-tests confirm
that obese candidates are judged significantly less suitable than
normal weight candidates [t(180) = 39.47, p < 0.001, Cohen’

dz = 2.94] and the No Photo condition [t(180) = 22.95,
p < 0.001, Cohen’
s dz = 1.71]. Also, normal weight candidates
were judged significantly more positive than the No Photo
condition [t(180) = 36.35, p < 0.001, Cohen’
s dz = 2.70]. These
results are in lines of Hypothesis 1 as obese candidates were
assessed as less suitable for employment compared to normal
weight candidates. A significant interaction between Gender
and Photo was also evident [F(2,360) = 47,11, p < 0.001,
η2
p = 0.21] and is further interpreted below is relation to
Hypothesis 3.
Workplace Activity Level
To assess whether obese people applying to active working
environments are more likely to be discriminated against than
in non-active working environment (Hypothesis 2), a repeated
measures ANOVA using the averaged personnel suitability score
(see Table 1) of gender between Photo conditions as within-
subject factor and workplace as a between subject factor was
conducted.
There was a significant interaction between Workplace and
Photo [F(6,354) = 52.95 at p < 0.001, η2
p = 0.47]. Main effects
were found for Photo [F(2,354) = 2380.55, p < 0.001, η2
p = 0.93]
and Workplace [F(3,177) = 115.33, p < 0.001, η2
p = 0.662].
To further analyze the interactions, a one-way ANOVA was
conducted for each workplace to examine differences between
photo conditions. Significantly different judgments of suitability
were reported for all four workplace activity levels, between
Photo conditions: obese [F(3,177) 171.971, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.74];
normal weight [F(3,93.39) = 5.82, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.16]; and No
Photo [F(3,91.94) = 58.46, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.66; see Table 1].
A Tukey post hoc test revealed significant differences across
all workplace groups in the obese and No Photo conditions
(p < 0.05). A significant difference in the normal weight
condition was found between the sedentary workplace group
compared to the standing, manual and heavy manual workplaces
(p < 0.001).
The lowest average suitability score across all the groups was
received by obese candidates, which decreased as the physical
demands of the workplace increased. Candidates without a photo
received higher suitability scores than obese candidates, however
a similar trend in the obese photo condition was observed.
Finally, normal weight candidates profited from including their
photo in their CVs. Such candidates were rated significantly more
suitable for heavy manual workplace. Their scores across the
rest of workplaces were similar and on average, higher than the
No Photo and obese conditions. These results are in support of
Hypothesis 2; hence obese candidates applying for employment
in active environments were discriminated more than in non-
active environment.
Gender Discrimination
To test Hypothesis 3, repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated
that there was a significant interaction between Gender and Photo
[F(2,360) = 47.11, p < 0.001, η2
p = 0.21]. A main effect for Gender
and Photo was found [F(1,180) = 196.79, p < 0.001, η2
p = 0.52;
F(1.49,268.57) = 1249.40, p < 0.001, η2
p = 0.87, respectively].
Pairwise comparisons revealed that males were assessed as more
suitable that females (Mdiff = 2.90, p < 0.001, 95% CI [2.49,
3.31]; see Figure 4). These results support Hypothesis 3 that obese
women are more likely to be discriminated against than obese
men (see Figure 4).
An significant interaction was evident between Workplace and
Gender [F(3,177) = 44.90, p < 0.001, η2
p = 0.43]. The results are
captured in Figure 5, where both males and females suitability
scores reduce as the activity level of workplace increases. Figure 5
demonstrates that this is more profound for females compared to
males.
To assess the any gender difference in the gap between obese
weight, normal weight and no photo conditions, paired sample
t-tests was conducted. Significant differences were observed
between normal weight and obese candidates [t(180) = 7.97,

[t(180) = 0.30, p > 0.05, Cohen’

candidate is ambiguous.
Finally, to examine whether the suitability scores were
predicted by the participants’
attitudes and beliefs about obesity
(i.e., scores from the ATOP, BAOP, F-scale, and IAT). Multivariate
multiple regression demonstrated that BAOP [F(6,171) = 5,57,

p = 0.164] and F-scale [F(6,171) = 3,82, p = 0.001,

p = 0.118] scores had a statistically significant relationship with
the joint distribution of the suitability scores. Non-significant
findings were evident for both the IAT [F(6,171) = 1,61,
p > 0.05, η2
p = 0.053] and ATOP [F(6,171) = 1,23, p > 0.05,

p = 0.041]. Scores on the BAOP (belief that obesity is
controllable) significantly predicted perceived suitability of the

DISCUSSION
The
current
study
examined
whether
obese
people
are
discriminated against when applying for employment. Overall,
the current study findings provide further evidence of obesity
discrimination in the hiring process for employment. First the
findings demonstrated that obese candidates were discriminated
against when applying for work compared to normal weight
candidates and when the weight status of the candidate was
not revealed. These findings are in line with previous reports
of obesity discrimination in the hiring process of employment
(e.g., Bartels and Nordstrom, 2013; Flint and Snook, 2014;
Flint et al., 2015a). This study goes beyond previous work
investigating the impact of weight status on recruitment (e.g.,
Bartels and Nordstrom, 2013) by examining differences in
perceived suitability between candidates whose weight status
is revealed compared to when it is not revealed. In doing so
the current study has demonstrated that when weight status
FIGURE 5 | Gender difference across workplace activity level.
is not revealed, candidates are perceived as more suitable for
employment than obese candidates. This effect was observed for
both males and females.
Second, the findings demonstrated that obese candidates
were evaluated as less suitable across all four workplaces
of different physical demand, in particular by participants
from heavy manual workforces. This finding demonstrates that
irrespective of the physical demand of a job, obese candidates
are perceived as less suitable for employment compared with
normal weight candidates and when the weight status of the
candidate is not revealed. It is likely that stereotypes of obese
people as less physically capable and slothfulness (Puhl et al.,
2008; Sawbridge and Fitzgerald, 2009) have contributed to this
finding.
Third, the current study findings demonstrate that when
examining whether the gender of the candidate impacts perceived
suitability for work, female candidates were perceived as less
suitable across all photo conditions compared to male candidates.
Previous research has reported gender differences in perceptions
of obesity (e.g., Flint et al., 2016) and that obese female candidates
are assessed less favorably than obese males. For example, in a
study examining the impact of a defendant’
s weight status on
perceptions of guilt, Schvey et al. (2013) reported that obese
females were more likely to be adjudged as guilty compared to
obese males. In addition to demonstrating that overall females
compare less favorably to males when applying for work, the
current study demonstrates that obese females are perceived as
less suitable than obese males across workforces of differing
physical demand. For example, obese female candidates were
perceived as less suitable for the heavy manual job compared to
obese male candidates.
More generally, the current study adds to increasing evidence
of obesity discrimination. Given the increasing prevalence of
obesity, and thus, greater numbers of overweight and obese
candidates, the current study findings require consideration at
policy level to ensure all candidates, irrespective of weight status,
have equal opportunities for employment. The findings suggest

Obesity Discrimination in the Workplace
that guidelines for workplace recruitment where weight status
is not revealed is warranted. Obesity discrimination needs to
be recognized as a rising issue and appropriate legislation has
to be regulated, and thus, modification to current UK and
EU legislation is required. The current study also demonstrates
that irrespective of weight status, females are assessed as less
suitable for work across all four workforce groupings based
on the physical demands of the job. As such, it might also
be suggested that policy development might also consider the
removal of gender identification from workplace recruitment.
Thus, workplace applications and CVs where gender and
appearance are not identified appear to be an appropriate step
that leads to a less discriminative process of employment. These
results are of particular importance for countries where a photo
is required on a CV, such as Spain (Recruitment Spain, 2015) and
China (Job Era, 2015).
Finally, in comparison previous research (Bartels and
Nordstrom,
2013)
examining
obesity
discrimination
in
recruitment for work, it might be argued that the current
study provides a more realistic design to that of real workplace
recruitment. The current study required participants to assess
a range of candidates for employment rather than assessing
only one candidate’
s suitability, and thus more synonymous
with real recruitment selection. Furthermore, all participants
in the current study had previous experience of recruitment,
compared to only 45% of participants in Bartels ad Nordstrom’
s
study.
The current study is not without limitations. One limitation
was the sampling strategy which did not account for gender
and BMI. This resulted in uneven amounts of males and
females across the four workforce groups, particularly in the
heavy manual workplace. There was also a left skew of BMI
where overall the sample was slightly overweight. Previous
research (e.g., Flint et al., 2015b) has reported differences in
anti-fat attitudes based on gender and BMI. Another potential
limitation of the study is that whilst all participants were fluent
English speakers, the stimuli words used in the IAT might
not have been familiar words for all participants impacting
response latency. However, IAT scores in the current study
are similar to those reported in previous research (e.g., Flint
et al., 2015b). Despite this, future cross country research
examining implicit attitudes could examine familiarity with
stimuli to ensure this potential limitation is avoided. Finally, the
construct validity of the IATs has been question. For example,
Oswald et al. (2013) conducted a meta-analysis to examine
the predictive validity of the IAT and explicit measures as
measures of discrimination. Oswald et al. (2013) questioned the
performance of the IATs suggesting that they were no stronger
than explicit measures. Whist further research is required
that sheds light on the validity of IATs, our findings show
that anti-fat attitudes are evident on an implicit and explicit
level, and that obese candidates are significantly discriminated
in recruitment for employment compared to normal weight
candidates and when the weight status of the candidate is
not revealed. Despite the potential limitations identified, this
research has raised some important questions and areas for
future research. The workplace environment has a number
of impacts such as work satisfaction and productivity. With
increasing reports of obesity discrimination in the workplace,
future research examining why and in what ways obese
people are discriminated whilst in the workplace is warranted.
This research should aim to identify both verbal and non-
verbal behavior that to the authors’knowledge is yet to be
understood.
CONCLUSION
The current study provides evidence of obesity discrimination in
the hiring process for employment, where across four workplaces
that vary based on the physical demands of the job, obese
candidates were perceived as less suitable compared with normal
weight candidates and when the weight status of the candidate
was not revealed. The study goes beyond previous research
examining perceived suitability of obese candidates, using a more
valid design whilst addressing methodological shortcomings of
previous research. The study demonstrates that gender and
weight status impact judgments of suitability for work and that
the more physically demanding the job, the more likely it is that
obese candidates compared to normal weight or candidates where
weight status is not revealed are to less favorable assessments of
suitability, and that females compared to males are judged as
less suitable for work. Obese female candidates were judged as
the least suitable for work, and thus, hold implications for the
success rate in the hiring process and therefore unemployment of
obese females. The findings contribute to growing calls for policy
development to address this growing concern.
