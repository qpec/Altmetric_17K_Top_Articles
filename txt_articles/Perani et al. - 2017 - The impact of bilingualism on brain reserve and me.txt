Cognitive reserve (CR) prevents cognitive decline and delays
neurodegeneration. Recent epidemiological evidence suggests
that lifelong bilingualism may act as CR delaying the onset of
dementia by ∼4.5 y. Much controversy surrounds the issue of bi-
lingualism and its putative neuroprotective effects. We studied
brain metabolism, a direct index of synaptic function and density,
and neural connectivity to shed light on the effects of bilingualism
in vivo in Alzheimer’s dementia (AD). Eighty-five patients with
probable AD and matched for disease duration (45 German-Italian
bilingual speakers and 40 monolingual speakers) were included.
Notably, bilingual individuals were on average 5 y older than their
monolingual peers. In agreement with our predictions and with
models of CR, cerebral hypometabolism was more severe in the
group of bilingual individuals with AD. The metabolic connectivity
analyses crucially supported the neuroprotective effect of bilin-
gualism by showing an increased connectivity in the executive
control and the default mode networks in the bilingual, compared
with the monolingual, AD patients. Furthermore, the degree of
lifelong bilingualism (i.e., high, moderate, or low use) was signif-
icantly correlated to functional modulations in crucial neural net-
works, suggesting both neural reserve and compensatory
mechanisms. These findings indicate that lifelong bilingualism acts
as a powerful CR proxy in dementia and exerts neuroprotective
effects against neurodegeneration. Delaying the onset of demen-
tia is a top priority of modern societies, and the present in vivo
neurobiological evidence should stimulate social programs and
interventions to support bilingual or multilingual education and
the maintenance of the second language among senior citizens.

any studies reported that cognitive activities and environ-
mental factors, such as lifelong exposure to stimulating
cognitive, social, and physical activities, as well as high socioeco-
nomic status and educational and occupational attainments, pro-
vide a cognitive reserve (CR) potentially delaying dementia onset
(1, 2). In vivo neuroimaging has provided important insights into
the neural correlates of CR. For example, structural MRI studies
in healthy aging consistently reported positive associations be-
tween CR and increased gray and white matter volumes in asso-
ciative frontal and temporoparietal cortices (3), as well as reduced
mean diffusivity (i.e., better integrity) in the bilateral hippocampi
(4). Limited evidence exists on the protective role of CR in neu-
rodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s dementia (AD), as
shown by measures of cerebral metabolism with fluorodeox-
yglucose and PET (FDG-PET), used as a measure of neuronal
activity and viability (5, 6). FDG-PET offers the unique capability
to measure resting-state brain metabolism, which is a direct index
of synaptic function and density (7, 8).
In individuals with AD and mild cognitive impairment, higher
education, and occupation (as proxies of reserve) correlated with
more severe hypometabolism in temporoparietal areas and in the
precuneus (9, 10) and, in addition, with increased metabolism in
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, suggesting a compensatory
mechanism against AD-related cerebral neurodegeneration (11).
To date, strong epidemiological evidence suggests that bi-
lingualism may also contribute to CR (12). Crucially, older bi-
lingual individuals manifest symptoms of AD significantly later
than comparable monolinguals (13–15), with an approximate de-
lay of 4.5 y. Furthermore, bilingual speakers also show significantly
better cognitive recovery following stroke than monolinguals (16).
As to causal mechanism, these protective effects may be a direct
consequence of how the human brain has adapted to the “extra
effort” provided by handling two or more languages (17, 18). The
most important cognitive mechanism has been referred to as the
“language control” mechanism (19). This language control device
is considered part of the more general executive control system,
and the extra use of this system in bilingual speakers may induce
brain plasticity within the related cognitive control brain network
(20). Structural neuroimaging studies have consistently reported
increased gray and/or white matter densities for bilingual indi-
viduals in brain structures linked to executive control, such as the
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the left prefrontal cortex, the left
inferior parietal lobule, and the left caudate (for a review, see ref.
17). Of note, also in older healthy bilingual subjects, with many
years of second language experience, recent structural neuro-
imaging studies reported increased white matter integrity (21) and
gray matter volume in the anterior temporal lobes, orbitofrontal
cortex (22), and inferior parietal lobules (23). Specifically for aging
populations, this neural reserve may eventually protect against
cognitive decline (24). An enhanced neural efficiency was also
shown in bilingual seniors, with an increased functional con-
nectivity in the frontoparietal network for executive control
Significance
Recent epidemiological studies report that lifelong bilingualism
may delay dementia onset. However, the underlying neural
mechanism of these protective effects is largely unknown.
Using fluorodeoxyglucose and PET to investigate brain metabo-
lism and neural connectivity in individuals with Alzheimer’s de-
mentia, we unravel the neural mechanism responsible for the
bilingual individuals’ ability to cope better with Alzheimer’s de-
mentia. These findings foster the view that lifelong bilingualism
contributes to brain cognitive reserve.

 (ECN) and in the default mode network (DMN) (25), and in-
creased neural efficiency in prefrontal and ACC regions (26).
Notwithstanding the epidemiological evidence of the effect of
bilingualism in delaying dementia, its specific effects on the brain
of patients with neurodegenerative dementia, such as AD, has
not yet been investigated. The notion of bilingualism as a pro-
tective factor contributing to the CR is relatively new and not
universally accepted (27, 28).
This research aimed at crucially contributing to the issue, by
assessing the cerebral resting-state metabolic activity combined
with connectivity analyses (29) in bilingual and monolingual in-
dividuals with AD. Our hypothesis is that bilingualism, acting as
a protective factor, should contribute to the neural reserve
through relevant neurobiological effects.
Results
Demographic Characteristics and Neuropsychology. Descriptive
statistics of demographic variables (means and SDs) and their
comparison are reported in Table 1. Significant differences were
found for age (P = 2.75 × e−7) and for education (P = 0.019) in
bilingual compared with monolingual subjects. The Mini-Mental
State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating
(CDR) scores did not differ between the two groups.
Language production and attentional functions did not differ be-
tween the two groups, whereas visuospatial short-term memory, verbal
short-term, and long-term memory were significantly more impaired
in monolingual than in bilingual patients (see Table 1 for details).
FDG-PET Comparisons. Analyses of brain hypometabolic structures
revealed both similarities and differences between bilingual and
monolingual individuals with AD. Specifically, both groups
showed severe and extensive hypometabolism in temporoparietal
associative cortices, as well as in the posterior cingulum and pre-
cuneus. In addition, hypometabolism affected in the left hemisphere
also the middle and superior temporal cortex, the inferior frontal
gyrus, the insula, and the ACC in the bilingual group only [all results
are reported at P < 0.05 familywise error (FWE) correction for
multiple comparisons; cluster extent (k) > 100]. Results from the
statistical parametrical mapping (SPM) analyses were overlaid on the
MRI standard template to illustrate commonalities and differences
of cerebral hypometabolic patterns between the two groups (Fig. 1).
The second-level direct comparison between groups confirmed
the more severe left hemispheric hypometabolism in bilingual,
compared with monolingual, subjects in the inferior frontal gyrus and
the operculum, the orbitofrontal cortex, the superior temporal gyrus,
the inferior parietal lobule and operculum, the parahippocampal
gyrus, the insula, the putamen, and the cerebellum. On the right
hemisphere, there was a metabolic difference in the putamen and
cerebellum [P < 0.05 false-discovery rate (FDR)] (Table S1).
Correlations. The bilingual index (BI) was associated to statisti-
cally significant positive and negative correlations with brain
glucose metabolism (P < 0.005 uncorrected). Positive correla-
tions were found in the right inferior frontal gyrus and bilaterally
in the orbitofrontal cortex and left ACC (Fig. 2). Negative cor-
relations were identified bilaterally in the precuneus and cuneus
and in the left sensorimotor cortex and middle temporal gyrus
(see Fig. 2 and Table S2 for details).
FDG-PET Metabolic Connectivity.
ECN. Consistent connectivity results were found for both AD
groups in the seed regions. An increased anterior–posterior
metabolic connectivity was found in the bilingual group. Using
the bilateral posterior seeds (encompassing both the inferior and
superior lobules as well as the angular gyrus), we found increased
long-distance metabolic connectivity between these parietal areas
and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in bilingual compared with
monolingual individuals. A similar finding was evident when the
seeds were located in the bilateral middle and superior frontal gyri,
resulting in increased connectivity with the superior parietal cortices
only in the bilingual group. Along similar lines, using bilateral cau-
date nucleus as seeds, increased connectivity was associated to an
extensive network encompassing the anterior, middle, and posterior
cingulate cortex, the right insula, the right inferior frontal gyrus, and
the right parietal operculum, again only for bilinguals (Fig. 3).
DMNs. The resting-state whole-brain metabolic connectivity of the
dorsal DMN showed major differences between bilingual and
monolingual subjects. Specifically, significant metabolic correla-
tions were found within the seed region (i.e., autocorrelation
within the posterior cingulum/precuneus itself) in both bilingual
and monolingual patients, whereas additional metabolic correla-
tions encompassing the cingulate cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex,
the caudate nucleus, and the thalamus, bilaterally were identified
only in the bilingual group (P < 0.01, FDR). For the anterior
DMN, significant metabolic connectivity was identified between
the frontal seed regions (i.e., ACC and medial frontal cortex) and
the posterior cingulum, again only in the bilingual group (Fig. 3).
Discussion
CR is a protective factor against age-associated cognitive decline
and dementia. Recent epidemiological evidence suggests that life-
long bilingualism may act as a CR factor, delaying the onset of
dementia by ∼4–5 y. No evidence exists, however, on the possible
neural protective effects of bilingualism in AD. In the present study,

 we used FDG-PET to measure brain metabolism and connectivity
to shed light on the neuroprotective effects of bilingualism. In
agreement with theories of CR and with our predictions, cerebral
hypometabolism was much more extended in bilingual individuals
with AD in comparison with the monolinguals (Fig. 1 and Table
S1). Despite the more severe pattern of brain hypometabolism,
bilingual individuals with AD actually outperformed monolinguals
on short- and long-term verbal memory and visuospatial tasks but
not on language tasks (Table 1). The findings of better performance
on memory tasks fit well with the general notion that healthy bi-
lingual subjects may have an advantage over monolingual individ-
uals in memory tasks and, in particular, in visuospatial memory
tasks (30–32). The observed lack of differences on language tasks
should be interpreted with caution. In language tasks, healthy bi-
lingual subjects usually have more difficulties than monolingual
subjects (33, 34), particularly with respect to lexical production, as
reported in previous studies (e.g., ref. 35). Hence, the lack of dif-
ferences for language tasks reported here could actually reflect the
overcoming of a known disadvantage.
Overall, these findings strongly suggest that bilingual individ-
uals with AD compensate better for the loss of brain structure
and function. Of note, the BI [i.e., the relative use and exposure
to a second language (L2)] correlated not only with more severe
hypometabolism in several posterior brain regions but also with
increased metabolism in the orbitofrontal, inferior frontal, and
cingulate cortex, perhaps as a compensation mechanism (i.e.,
increased efficiency) for the severe brain hypometabolism ob-
served in bilingual individuals with AD (Fig. 2 and Table S2).
Further support for our assumption derives from the connectivity
analysis, indicating compensation in the anterior frontal network
underlying cognitive control and the presence of stronger con-
nections in the ECN and DMN in bilingual individuals with AD.
Notably, in our patient cohort, there was a significant differ-
ence for age, with bilingual subjects being on average 5 y older,
which is in line with recent findings (14) in larger cohorts of
dementia cases. Overall, this protective bilingual effect was
shown independently of other potential confounding factors,
such as education, sex, occupation, and urban vs. rural dwelling
of subjects (for a review, see ref. 12). It is also unlikely that the
differences between bilingual and monolingual AD groups may
be due to some demographic variables. All subjects belong to the
same geographical area, namely Northern Italy, and the bilingual
subjects in this series were older and had lower education than
their monolingual peers (respectively, mean 77.13 y of age vs. 71.42
and mean 8.26 y of education vs. 10.5 y). Education and occupation
are indeed among the main sources and proxies of CR (1), and our
bilingual subjects could be expected to be at a disadvantage in
terms of CR (1). Many studies reported that brain hypometabolism
in AD is more severe in subjects with higher education because
they can compensate longer with brain neurodegeneration (1, 10).
Nevertheless, we observed a more severe hypometabolism and
comparable or better cognitive performance in the bilingual group
despite the significantly inferior years of education compared with
the monolinguals. Our findings suggest that the effects of speaking
two languages are more powerful than both age and education in
providing a protection against cognitive decline.
We have recently advocated two distinct neural mechanisms to
explain how bilingualism protects the aging brain, respectively,
“neural reserve” and “neural compensation” (12). Following the
former mechanism, lifelong use of two languages would result in
structural changes in the brain such as increased gray and white
matter densities in specific networks [i.e., those related to domain

 general executive functions (24) and language learning (36)].
Studies comparing older healthy bilingual subjects to matched
monolinguals do, indeed, report that bilingual speakers have in-
creased white matter density in the frontal lobes (21), in the ACC
(37), the inferior parietal lobules (23), and the temporal pole
areas (22, 38). The causative explanation for these structural
modifications is that lifelong overuse of executive functions (i.e.,
to control two language systems to speak in one language without
interference from the other) can induce plastic changes in the
brain, resulting in a neural reserve that eventually renders the
bilingual brain more resistant against brain aging effects.
The second mechanism is neural compensation, acting as the
mechanism to overcome the loss of brain structure such as brain
atrophy in aging or neurodegeneration. The suggested mecha-
nism for compensation is that bilingualism is associated with
stronger functional connectivity induced by the increased cog-
nitive load on executive functions entailed by bilingualism (see
ref. 25 for functional MR connectivity in older healthy bilingual
subjects reporting stronger intrinsic functional connectivity in the
frontoparietal control network). This stronger functional con-
nectivity, in turn, renders the brain capable of coping better also
with neurodegeneration and the loss of neurons such as in de-
mentia (i.e., the bilingual brain better compensates) (12). To
corroborate this hypothesis, we performed a metabolic connec-
tivity analysis on the FDG-PET data on two distinct networks: the
ECN and the DMN. Notably, there was increased metabolic con-
nectivity both in the frontoparietal ECN and in DMN, restricted
only to bilingual subjects. The DMN showed increased connectivity
between the posterior cingulum and subcortical structures (i.e., the
thalamus and the caudate nucleus bilaterally) and the anterior cin-
gulum, all pivotal brain structures for language control in bilingual
subjects (19, 39). As for the ECN, we revealed for bilingual indi-
viduals connectivity increases both in frontoparietal networks, bi-
laterally, and in a specific network encompassing several regions for
cognitive and language control, such as the cingulate cortex, the
inferior frontal gyrus, the parietal operculum, the insula, and the
caudate nucleus, more evident on the right hemisphere (18). This
asymmetry may reflect a compensatory mechanism for the dys-
functional involvement of the language dominant hemisphere.
The selective connectivity patterns found for both the DMN
and the ECN in bilingual subjects suggests a strong functional
integration between these structures (40). In particular, the re-
sults supporting an increased anterior–posterior connectivity for
bilingual compared with monolingual individuals with AD are in
line with theories of brain compensation during healthy aging,
such as the posterior to anterior shift in aging (41).
Previous evidence reported decreased connectivity in the
DMN paralleled by enhanced resting-state functional connec-
tivity in frontal regions in AD, likely in an attempt to maintain
cognitive efficiency (42, 43). Our present resting-state metabolic

 connectivity findings are also compatible with the suggestion by
Grady et al. (44) that recruitment of additional prefrontal re-
gions in AD patients may reflect a compensative strategy to
maintain cognitive functions. Our results highlight an increased
connectivity in the anterior DMN in the bilingual AD group,
suggesting not only that functional compensatory mechanisms in
AD patients involve a posterior to anterior shift but also that this
shift is more pronounced in bilinguals.
Increased functional connectivity was also recently reported by
means of fMRI investigations in healthy older bilingual subjects,
indicating a protective effect of bilingualism on white matter integrity
(21, 25). Because bilingualism heavily relies on the constant control
of two languages, the cerebral regions and connections responsible
for such control become more tuned (12, 25). Here, we show that
the strengthening of connections is still present in AD dementia as
the direct result of lifelong bilingualism. The enhanced connectivity
found in the ECN and DMN may represent a strong compensation
mechanism, allowing bilingual individuals with AD to cope with
dementia more efficiently compared with monolinguals. To further
strengthen this hypothesis, our correlational analysis indicates that
the BI correlated positively with glucose metabolism in frontal
structures. In other words, those individuals who were more exposed
to both languages had increased metabolism in frontal regions,
which, in turn, may compensate for the neurodegeneration.
We suggest that both mechanisms (i.e., neural reserve and
compensation) may explain the present and previous findings
from retrospective studies with monolingual and bilingual pa-
tients with dementia compared for age of symptom onset. The
4- to 5-y delay of dementia onset for bilinguals from different
populations, such as Canada (13), India (14), and Belgium (15) is
approximately the difference of age found between the bilinguals
and monolinguals in the present study.
Considering that bilingualism is a global phenomenon, and that
half of the world is actually bilingual (45), it is highly unlikely that
half of the world is protected against dementia. Crucially, what
actually protects the brain may be specific types of bilingualism. We
have elsewhere suggested that only those bilinguals with lifelong
exposure to and use of both languages will have the maximum
benefits (12, 22). The differences in variables related to bilingualism
(e.g., low vs. high exposure and extent of use of a second language)
may have crucial repercussions on building up a CR. Specifically for
this purpose, in this study, we have created a BI, measuring the daily
and long-life use of languages in our patient cohort. Consider a
typical scenario in the world of globalization: many native speakers
generally acquire a L2 for schooling and professional purposes
(such as English worldwide or Mandarin in China). Usually, both
languages are used regularly during professional lives, but once
these individuals retire, they use the L2 less than their native lan-
guage. We previously reported that in these aging populations, only
those individuals who maintained high use of a second language
showed the most significant neuroprotective effects (22). In the
present study, we add further evidence in AD, showing that patients
with a higher BI show better neural compensation.
In conclusion, the present FDG-PET brain metabolic study provides
unique evidence of how lifelong bilingualism can protect the AD brain.
Delaying the onset of dementia is a top priority of modern societies,
and the notion that bilingualism acts as a powerful CR should stim-
ulate governments and health systems to activate social programs and
interventions to support bilingual or multilingual education.
Materials and Methods
Participants. Eighty-five patients were selected from two centers: the San
Raffaele Hospital in Milan (n = 40; 19 male and 21 female) and the Bozen
Central Hospital (n = 45; 13 male and 32 female). All of the patients were
diagnosed as probable AD according to the validated National Institute on
Aging–Alzheimer’s Association consensus criteria (46) and were in the early
disease stages (disease duration, <3 y). The clinical diagnosis was supported
by extensive neuropsychological testing and by the presence of a cerebral
hypometabolism pattern suggestive of AD, as semiquantitatively assessed at
the single-subject level. It is of note that, despite both the participating centers
being located in Northern Italy, bilingualism is rooted only in the city of Bozen
for geographical and historical reasons. All bilingual individuals with AD per-
manently resided in Bozen and were German-Italian bilingual speakers. The
native language (L1) was German in 30 cases and Italian in 15 patients.
Notably, a language background questionnaire derived from the Bilingual
Aphasia Test (47) assessed the percentage of daily use and life exposure to
each language (respectively, %L1 and %L2) in the bilingual group. Specifi-
cally, the following information was obtained by interviews with patients
and their relatives: place of birth (country, rural district, or city); language
spoken in the original family; the main language of education; language
certification or language degree; language spoken with the partner; lan-
guage in the environment of residence during lifetime or for many years;
type of occupational attainment and its language demand; and amount of
use of each language in various context in the daily living. Based on these
data the BI was computed as follows:
BI = 1 − jð%L1 − %L2Þj.
Thus, the BI ranges from 0 (i.e., completely monolingual) to 1 (i.e., perfect
bilingual who uses L1 and L2 for the same amount of time daily).
This study was approved by the San Raffaele Hospital scientific ethical
committee. All patients provided written informed consent, following de-
tailed explanation of the FDG-PET experimental procedure, and the study was
performed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Neuropsychology. All patients were fully evaluated for cognitive impairments in
the diagnostic workup for dementia assessment. Because different neuro-
psychological test batteries were applied, we used the equivalent scores (range:
0–4) for the tests assessing the same cognitive domain [i.e., language pro-
duction, visuospatial short-term memory, verbal short-term and long-term
memory, and attention functions: a standard procedure allowing the statistical
comparisons for different tests developed by Capitani and Laiacona (48)] (see
Table 1, SI Text, Neuropsychology, and Table S3 for details). To test for dif-
ferences in cognitive impairment, we compared the neuropsychological
equivalent scores between bilingual and monolingual patients. The compari-
son was performed by means of a two independent sample t tests.
FDG-PET. Details regarding FDG-PET acquisition and preprocessing are
reported in SI Text.
At the first level, each of the single-subject FDG images was analyzed by
means of an optimized single-subject procedure (49, 50), ending in a com-
parison of each AD case to a large dataset of healthy controls (SI Text). The
comparison generated single SPM t-maps showing regions of hypometabolism
with a strong level of significance (P < 0.05 FWE correction for multiple
comparisons). Each individual SPM t-Map was evaluated by neuroimaging
experts (D.P., T.B., and M.M.) to check for the presence of AD-related brain
hypometabolism. A second-level, voxel-wise, one-sample t test was applied to
identify the brain hypometabolism patterns in the bilingual and monolingual
groups. The analysis was run separately for the two groups. Subsequently, a
second-level, whole-brain two-independent-sample t test was applied to di-
rectly compare contrast images of monolingual and bilingual cases to identify
the between-groups differences. (See SI Text for analysis details.)
Correlation Analysis. Whole-brain positive and negative correlations between
brain glucose metabolism and the BI were tested by means of a voxel-level
multiple regression on the entire bilingual group (n = 45). Single-subject
contrast images were entered in the model setting the bilingualism index as
a covariate of interest. In addition, also nuisance covariates were included
into the statistical model: education, global cognitive status (i.e., MMSE
scores), and equivalent scores of neuropsychological tests assessing four
cognitive domains (i.e., verbal memory, visuospatial memory, language and
attention functions). To allow an easier interpretation of results, the signs of
the values in contrast images were reversed, so that a positive value repre-
sents an increase in glucose metabolism and a negative one a decrease.
Hence, positive and negative correlations mean that increasing BI correlate
respectively with an increase or a decrease in glucose consumption. The
significance level was set at P < 0.005 uncorrected for multiple comparisons
with a minimum cluster extent of ≥100 voxels.
FDG-PET Metabolic Connectivity Analysis. We further carried out a brain
metabolic connectivity analysis with the specific aim to investigate resting-state
metabolic networks in both groups. The core assumption of this analysis was that
brain regions whose glucose metabolism is correlated at rest are functionally

 associated (52). In this study, we applied the seed-based interregional correla-
tion analysis using voxel-wise SPM procedure as described in Lee et al. (29), to
investigate metabolic connectivity of the anterior and dorsal DMN and the
bilateral ECN. First, seed regions were defined either from a functional atlas of
resting state networks [as defined by Shirer et al. (53) (findlab.stanford.edu/
functional_ROIs.html] or based on a priori hypotheses for the caudate nuclei (18,
19). Namely, the posterior cingulum and precuneus were considered as seeds for the
dorsal DMN, and the anterior cingulum and medial frontal cortex for the anterior
DMN. For the ECN, three seeds were considered bilaterally: the caudate nuclei, the
superior and inferior parietal cortex, and the superior and middle frontal gyri. Then,
intensity normalization to the global mean was applied on the warped and
smoothed FDG-PET images, and mean FDG uptake was extracted from the seeds,
separately for the monolingual and bilingual individuals. The extracted mean seed
counts were set as variables of interest in a multiple regression model in SPM5,
testing for voxel-level correlations with the whole brain metabolic activity in
the two groups (P < 0.01, FDR correction for multiple comparisons; k > 100).
