Current efforts to develop Zika virus (ZIKV) subunit vaccines have been focused on pre-
membrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins, but the role of NS1 in ZIKV-specific immune
response and protection is poorly understood. Here, we develop an attenuated recombinant
vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine expressing ZIKV prM-E-NS1 as a polyprotein.
This vectored vaccine candidate is attenuated in mice, where a single immunization induces
ZIKV-specific antibody and T cell immune responses that provide protection against ZIKV
challenge. Co-expression of prM, E, and NS1 induces significantly higher levels of Th2 and
Th17 cytokine responses than prM-E. In addition, NS1 alone is capable of conferring partial
protection against ZIKV infection in mice even though it does not induce neutralizing anti-
bodies. These results demonstrate that attenuated rVSV co-expressing prM, E, and NS1 is a
promising vaccine candidate for protection against ZIKV infection and highlights an important
role for NS1 in ZIKV-specific cellular immune responses.

 Z
ika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that was
first identified in monkeys from the Zika forest, near Lake
Victoria, Uganda in 19471–3. Sporadic outbreaks of ZIKV
have since been reported in Africa and Asia4. Historically, people
infected with Zika virus have no or mild symptoms including
fever, rash, muscle pain, red eyes, headache, and conjunctivitis4,5.
However, in 2015 a ZIKV pandemic began in South America,
Central
America,
the Caribbean,
and
the USA,
suddenly
becoming a global public health issue5. Importantly, ZIKV from
these recent outbreaks can cause Congenital Zika Syndrome
(including microcephaly), Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other
severe neurological disorders6,7. ZIKV is primarily transmitted
through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito although
other transmission modes such as sexual, blood transfusion, and
maternal-fetal are also possible8–10. Currently, there is no FDA-
approved vaccine or antiviral drug for ZIKV.
ZIKV is a member of the virus family Flaviviridae, which also
includes other globally prevalent human pathogens such as
dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus
(WNV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). The ZIKV gen-
ome
encodes
a
single
polyprotein
that
is
cleaved
post-
translationally
into
three
structural
proteins
(capsid,
premembrane, and envelope) and seven nonstructural proteins
(NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5)11,12. The E
protein is a type II fusion protein which mediates cellular
attachment and membrane fusion, and is the target for most
neutralizing antibodies (Abs). Flavivirus prM protein typically
associates with E to form heterodimers and is important for
proper folding of E13–16. Co-expression of prM and E of several
flaviviruses including ZIKV results in the secretion of virus-like
particles (VLPs) termed recombinant subviral particles17–19. The
prM protein is an integral part of both virions and subviral
particles, and undergoes a cleavage event during virus matura-
tion20. Therefore, prM and E proteins have been the primary
targets for the rational design of subunit and recombinant flavi-
virus vaccines. However, the NS1 protein of several flaviviruses
has been shown to confer protection against flavivirus infection in
animal models in the absence of detectable neutralizing anti-
body21–26. Whether immunization with the ZIKV NS1 protein
has similar protective capabilities is currently unknown.
Recently, several ZIKV vaccine candidates have been reported,
including nucleic acid (DNA and mRNA), inactivated virus,
subunit, VLP, vectored vaccines (including adenovirus and vac-
cinia virus), and live attenuated vaccines17,19,27–34. These vaccine
candidates triggered various degrees of humoral and cellular
immunity and protection in rodent and/or nonhuman primate
models. Among these candidates, DNA vaccine, subunit vaccine,
and inactivated vaccine have been initiated for clinical trials.
Currently, all ZIKV subunit, DNA, and mRNA vaccines have
been targeted on the E or prM-E antigen. Although these vaccine
candidates are promising, exploration of other new and highly
efficacious ZIKV vaccines is needed.
Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a prototype nonsegmented
negative-sense (NNS) RNA virus that belongs to the Rhabdo-
viridae family. VSV is a natural pathogen of livestock such as
cattle and swine, as such, there is no pre-existing immunity
against VSV in the human population35,36. VSV is an excellent
platform for vaccine development. VSV can accommodate mul-
tiple foreign genes, and thus can be developed into a multivalent
vaccine35,36. Antigens are highly expressed in both cell culture
and animals by VSV, enabling the generation of strong systemic
immune responses35,37. In response to the sudden outbreaks of
Ebola virus in Africa in 2013, a VSV-based Ebola virus vaccine
was tested in human clinical trials38–41. In general, VSV is safe in
humans although high doses of VSV can cause side effects in
some people including joint and muscle pain39–41. Importantly,
the VSV-based Ebola virus vaccine was shown to be highly effi-
cacious in protecting against Ebola virus infection in humans39–
41. During preparation of this manuscript, Betancourt et al.,
reported that maternal antibody derived from female C57BL/6
mice inoculated with VSV expressing prM-E can protect off-
spring from lethal ZIKV infection42. However, whether an
immunized animal can be protected against ZIKV infection is not
known.
Here, we developed a methyltransferase (MTase)-defective
rVSV (mtdVSV)-based ZIKV vaccine platform. We recovered a
panel of rVSV expressing ZIKV prM-E-NS1, prM-E, E, E trun-
cation mutants, and NS1. These mtdVSV-based ZIKV vaccine
candidates were highly attenuated but remained effective in
triggering ZIKV-specific antibody and T cell immunity in mice,
and provided complete protection against ZIKV challenge in
immunocompetent BALB/c and type 1 interferon receptor-
deficient A129 mice. In addition, we found that NS1 protein
plays a regulatory role in ZIKV-specific T cell response, and that
NS1 alone can confer partial protection from ZIKV infection.
Collectively, this mtdVSV-based vaccine is a promising vaccine
candidate for ZIKV.
Results
Recovery of recombinant VSVs expressing ZIKV antigens. To
determine the feasibility of using VSV as a vaccine vector to
deliver ZIKV proteins, we constructed thirteen recombinant
viruses using the wild-type VSV genome as the backbone (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1A). These constructs allowed us to compare the
immunogenicity of various combinations of ZIKV wild-type and
mutant proteins, all including the E protein since it is known in
other flaviviruses to be the main target for neutralizing antibody
(Ab)43. ZIKV E protein is composed of an N-terminal ectodo-
main, consisting of three domains (I, II, and III), and a stem and a
C-terminal
transmembrane
(TM)
domain
(Supplementary
Fig. 1A)13,43. The major neutralizing epitopes are located in the
ectodomain of the E protein.
We first constructed rVSV-E which would express the full-
length E protein including the stem-TM domain (504 amino
acids) (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Since the exact boundary
between the ectodomain and the stem-TM domain is unclear,
we
constructed
three
E
truncation
mutants
lacking
the
predicted stem-TM domain in three recombinant viruses,
rVSV-E404, rVSV-E414, and rVSV-E415 which express the
N-terminal 404, 414, and 415 amino acids of the E protein,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Next, rVSVs expressing E
and E deletions with anchor C (signal peptide) were generated
(Supplementary Fig. 1A). These recombinant viruses were
named rVSV-aE, rVSV-aE404, rVSV-aE414, and rVSV-aE415.
We also constructed four recombinant viruses that would co-
express anchor C-prM with E, or the same E deletions, as a
polyprotein (Supplementary Fig. 1A). In addition, since the
NS1 protein of other flaviviruses has been shown to play a role
in protection21,25,44, we constructed rVSV-prM-E-NS1 which
expresses prM, E, and NS1 as a polyprotein (Supplementary
Fig. 1A).
Plaques formed by rVSV were 2.72 ± 0.17 mm (mean ±
standard deviation) in diameter, while plaques formed by rVSV
expressing ZIKV antigens ranged from 1.68 ± 0.17 to 2.08 ± 0.14
mm in diameter (Supplementary Fig. 1B), suggesting that
expression of these ZIKV proteins reduced the replication and
spread of rVSV. Next, we compared replication kinetics of rVSV,
rVSV-E, rVSV-prM-E, and rVSV-prM-E-NS1 in cell culture, and
found that rVSV-prM-E-NS1 had a significant delay in replica-
tion kinetics compared to parental rVSV (P < 0.05, Student’s t-
test) (Supplementary Fig. 2).

 High-level expression of ZIKV proteins by the VSV vector. We
next assessed the expression level of VSV vectored E protein and
its truncations. A 54 kDa full-length E protein was detected in
cells infected with rVSV-prM-E and rVSV-prM-E-NS1 but not
with rVSV-E (Fig. 1a, b). The NS1 protein was only detected in
rVSV-prM-E-NS1 infected cells (Fig. 1c), as expected. A smaller E
protein was detected in cells expressing the truncated E protein,
consistent with the shorter C-terminal domain (Fig. 1a). Quan-
titative analysis of three independent experiments showed that
rVSVs co-expressing prM with E or E truncations had approxi-
mately five times greater E protein expression compared to rVSVs
expressing E or E truncations without prM. Western blot of cell
culture supernatants showed that all rVSVs co-expressing prM
and E/E truncations released enough E/E truncation proteins into
the supernatant to be easily detectable without the need for
concentration (Supplementary Fig. 3A, B). The expression of prM
followed by truncated E likely results in the secretion of soluble E.
NS1 protein was also secreted into cell culture medium (Sup-
plementary Fig. 3C). However, no E/E truncation was detectable
in cell medium from rVSVs expressing E/E truncations alone
(Supplementary Fig. 3A, B). Next, we compared the expression
level of E/E truncations with or without anchor C signal peptide
by VSV vector. As shown in Fig. 1d, rVSV constructs with anchor
C had more abundant expression of E/E truncations compared to

 rVSV constructs without anchor C. E truncations were also
detected in the supernatants of rVSV constructs with anchor C
(Supplementary Fig. 3D). However, full-length E protein was still
not detectable by rVSV-aE, even though the anchor has been
fused with E (Supplementary Fig. 3D). Thus, co-expression of
anchor C and prM with the E/E truncations significantly
increased their E expression and/or stability. These results also
indicate that the prM, E, and NS1 proteins were proteolytically
cleaved from the polyprotein and secreted into cell culture
supernatants.
We also determined the kinetics of E protein expression
(Fig. 1e). E protein was detectable in rVSV-prM-E at 12 h post-
infection, reached the highest expression level at 24 h post-
infection, and declined by 36 h primarily because cells were lysed
by this time point as indicated by the reduction in β-actin.
Recombinant rVSV-prM-E-NS1 had a significant delay in E
protein expression. E protein was detectable at 24 h and reached
its highest level at 36 h post-infection, without cell death as
indicated by a continued high level of β-actin. E protein was not
detectable in cells infected by rVSV-E even at the time when most
cells were lysed. The expression of E protein by rVSV-prM-E and
rVSV-prM-E-NS1 but not by rVSV-E in virus-infected cells was
confirmed
by
[35S]
methionine-cysteine
metabolic
labeling
(Supplementary Fig. 4).
Expression of prM-E or prM-E-NS1 by rVSV generates VLPs.
Cells were infected with rVSV-E, rVSV-prM-E or rVSV-prM-E-
NS1 and the cell culture medium was harvested at 24–48 h post-
infection. Two types of particles, VSV (yellow arrow) and ZIKV
VLPs (white arrow) (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 5A), were
detected by negative-staining and electron microscopy. After
separation by CsCl isopycnic gradient centrifugation, a large
number of low density ZIKV VLPs were obtained from rVSV-
prM-E and rVSV-prM-E-NS1 infected cells (Fig. 1f and Supple-
mentary Fig. 5B, C). The ZIKV VLPs expressed by VSV had a
diameter of 30–40 nm, which are relatively smaller than native
ZIKV virions (40–50 nm) (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 5E, F).
No VLPs were detected in cell culture medium from cells infected
with rVSV-E (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 5D). Therefore,
these results confirm that expression of prM-E and prM-E-NS1
but not E alone by the VSV vector resulted in the assembly of
VLPs.
Co-expression of prM with E/E truncations induce more
antibody. Next, we tested the immunogenicity of nine recom-
binant viruses in mice. BALB/c mice were inoculated intrana-
sally with a single dose (106 PFU) of each recombinant virus.
The DNA vaccine was used as a control. Briefly, mice were
intramuscularly injected with 50 µg of pCI-prM-E and were
boosted with same dose of pCI-prM-E two weeks later. Mice
infected with rVSV exhibited severe clinical signs, including
ataxia, hyperexcitability, and paralysis. At 7 days post-inocu-
lation, two of the five mice were dead, and the remaining three
mice were dead at day 10 post-inoculation. However, rVSVs
expressing ZIKV antigens showed various degrees of attenua-
tion. Mice inoculated with these recombinant viruses had mild
clinical signs (such as a ruffled coat) and experienced body
weight losses for 1 week, but started to gain weight by 10 days
(Supplementary Fig. 6). Overall, rVSVs co-expressing prM and
E/E truncation mutants were more attenuated in mice than
rVSV expressing E/E truncation alone. For example, rVSV-
prM-E
and
rVSV-prM-E414
had
significantly
less
body
weight loss compared to rVSV-E (P = 0.021, t-test) and rVSV-
E414 (P = 0.045, t-test) respectively at day 7 post-inoculation.
Recombinant rVSV-prM-E-NS1 was the most attenuated virus
(Supplementary Fig. 6). Mice inoculated with this virus
experienced little or no weight loss and did not display any
other clinical signs. This experiment demonstrated that rVSV
expressing ZIKV antigens, particularly rVSV-prM-E-NS1, were
significantly attenuated in mice compared to the parental
rVSV.
The dynamics of ZIKV E-specific Ab production following
vaccination, determined by ELISA, is summarized in Fig. 1g. At
1 week post-inoculation, most (3 or 4 out of 5) mice inoculated
with rVSV co-expressing prM-E/E truncation mutants had high
levels of serum IgG against ZIKV E protein. At week 2 post-
inoculation, all mice in these groups had developed IgG Ab. Ab
titers further increased and remained at a high level through week
5. In contrast, none of the mice vaccinated with rVSV expressing
E/E truncation mutants without prM had detectable ZIKV-
specific antibody by week 1. The same was true for rVSV-prM-E-
NS1. At week 2, Ab was observed in these groups and increased
through week 5. However, the Ab titers in these groups were
significantly lower than those of the viruses co-expressing prM-E/
E truncation mutants (P < 0.05, t-test). Ab was not detectable in
the DNA vaccine group until week 5, despite the fact that these
mice had been given two doses (at week 0 and 2). The Ab
detected in the DNA vaccine group at week 5 post-immunization
was also lower than that induced by the rVSV-prM-E/E
truncations.
These
results
demonstrate
that
a
single-dose
inoculation of mice with rVSV co-expressing prM-E/E trunca-
tions triggered high levels of serum antibody response as early as
1–2 weeks post-inoculation.
Attenuation of recombinant VSV expressing ZIKV antigens.
To enhance the safety of VSV as a vector, we further attenuated it
with a specific mutation that inhibits its mRNA cap methyl-
transferase (MTase) activity. We previously showed that a single
point mutation (G1670A) in the S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM)
binding site in the MTase region of the large (L) polymerase
protein resulted in a recombinant virus (rVSV-G1670A) that was
defective in mRNA cap guanine-N-7 methylation but not ribose
2′-O methylation45. Compared to rVSV, this recombinant virus
was highly attenuated in cell culture as well as in mice45,46. The
G1670A mutation was introduced into VSV backbone to generate
rVSV-G1670A-E, rVSV-G1670A-aE, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E, and
rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1,
respectively
(Supplementary
Fig. 7A). The plaque diameters of rVSV-G1670A-E, rVSV-
G1670A-aE, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E, and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-
NS1 were 1.64 ± 0.08, 1.68 ± 0.10, 1.73 ± 0.11, and 0.85 ± 0.12 mm
respectively, significantly smaller than the recombinant viruses
derived from the wild-type VSV backbone (Compare Supple-
mentary Fig. 7B, Fig. 1b). Single-step replication curves showed
that VSV-G1670A-E, VSV-G1670A-aE, and rVSV-G1670A-prM-
E had replication kinetics similar to rVSV-G1670A, whereas
rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 had a significant delay (P = 5.82 ×
109 and 0.0021 at time points 12 and 24 h respectively, t-test)
(Fig. 2a). At 24 h post-infection, the expression of E can be ranked
rVSV-G1670A-prM-E > rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 > rVSV-
G1670A-aE (Fig. 2b). No E protein expression was detected from
rVSV-G1670A or rVSV-G1670A-E, but NS1 protein expression
was detected from rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 (Fig. 2b). In a
kinetic experiment, E protein expression was maximal from
rVSV-G1670A-aE and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E at 12 and 36 h
respectively, but was delayed in rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1-
infected cells (Fig. 2c). Similarly, E and NS1 proteins were
secreted into cell culture medium in virus-infected cells (Fig. 2d,
e, and Supplementary Fig. 8). Compared to the parental rVSV
vector, E protein expression was delayed from the rVSV-G1670A
vector (Fig. 2d, compare upper and lower panels), suggesting that

demonstrated that ZIKV E and NS1 proteins were highly

genic. We next tested the MTase-defective VSV (mtdVSV)-based
vaccines in BALB/c mice. Intranasal wild-type rVSV killed the
mice within 7 days (Fig. 2f). Mice inoculated with rVSV-G1670A

mice at weeks 2 and 4 post-immunization, respectively (Fig. 2g).
There was no significant difference in ELISA (Fig. 2g) or
neutralizing antibody titer (Fig. 2h) at week 5 between these two
groups (P > 0.05). No ZIKV specific antibody was detected in
DMEM, rVSV-G1670A or rVSV-G1670A-E groups. Compared
to the wild-type rVSV backbone, mtdVSV-based viruses had a
delayed antibody response (compare Fig. 1f, Fig. 2g), reflecting
the significant more attenuation of these recombinant viruses. In
addition, all mice in the rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 group
developed NS1-specific antibody as detected by ELISA at week

vaccine candidates are highly attenuated and immunogenic in
mice.
Co-expression of NS1 regulates ZIKV-specific T cell responses:
Induction of antigen-specific Ab and cytotoxic T cell responses
capable of providing protection after immunization requires T
helper cells (CD4+CD3+ cells). We found that spleen cells from
mice that had been intranasally immunized with rVSV-G1670A-
E, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E or rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 and
restimulated in vitro with ZIKV E protein, increased the number
of T helper cells (CD3+CD4+) (Fig. 3a). This finding indicates
that immunization induced ZIKV E-specific T cells capable of
proliferation after re-exposure to the E antigen.
Th1 cells produce important cytokines (i.e., IFN-γ and TNF-α)
for the production of complement fixing Abs and cytotoxic
T cells, which together are crucial for protection against
intracellular pathogens such as viruses. Flow cytometry analysis
of CD3+CD4+ cells producing Th1 cytokines revealed that only
cells isolated from mice immunized with rVSV-G1670A-prM-E
and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 expressed ZIKV antigen-specific
IFN-γ producing T helper cells (CD4+IFN-γ+) (Fig. 3b).
Interestingly, TNF-α producing T helper cells (CD4+TNF-α+)

Proliferation of CD4+ T cells
Fig. 3 MTase-defective rVSV (mtdVSV)-based vaccine induces ZIKV-specific T helper cell responses. Six-week-old BALB/c mice were immunized with
each vaccine candidate (5 mice per group). Mice were euthanized at day 35 post-immunization, the spleen was isolated from each mouse, homogenized, a
cell suspension prepared, split into three wells (triplicate per mouse) and cultured in 96-well microtiter plates in the presence of 20 µg/ml of ZIKV E
protein for 5 days. a Proliferation of CD4+ T cells. The frequencies of ZIKV-specific Th1 (IFN-γ+CD4+ and TNF-α+CD4+) (b), Th2 cells (IL-4+CD4+,
IL-5+CD4+) (c), Th17 (IL-17A+ CD4+) (d), and Tfh (IL-21+ CD4+) (e) cells were determined by flow cytometry after intracellular staining with the
corresponding anti-cytokine. Data were expressed as mean % positive cells (the mean of 15 samples: 3 wells × 5 mice) ± standard deviation. Asterisk

G1670A-prM-E,
but
not
rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1.
These
results indicate that co-expression of NS1 enhances IFN-γ, but
inhibits production of TNF-α by T helper cells.
Th2 cells produce an array of cytokines, which support the
production of Abs more likely to protect against extracellular
pathogens such as viruses. Interleukin 21, the signature product
of follicular T helper cells (Tfh) and IL-17A the product of Th17
cells facilitate antibody production and affinity maturation. Both
rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E induced a
similar level of CD4+IL-4+, a Th2 cytokine (P > 0.05, t-test) in
spleen cells after in vitro restimulation with ZIKV E protein
(Fig. 3c). However, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 induced signifi-
cantly higher CD4+IL-5+ and CD4+IL-10+, the other two Th2
cytokines (P < 0.05, t-test). Interestingly, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-
NS1 also induced a significantly higher Th17 response (CD4+IL-
17A+) than rVSV-G1670A-prM-E (P < 0.001, t-test) (Fig. 3d). In
addition, ZIKV E-specific Tfh cells (CD4+IL-21+) were produced
at similar levels in rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 and rVSV-
G1670A-prM-E inoculated mice (P > 0.05, t-test) (Fig. 3e). These
results demonstrated that mtdVSV-based vaccines triggered
ZIKV-specific T cell responses and that co-expression of NS1
enhances Th2 and Th17 responses. In addition, the fact that co-
expression of NS1 enhances IFN-γ suggests that NS1 modulated
the Th1 response (Fig. 3b). Collectively, our results suggest that
the presence of NS1 leads to a more balanced response including
Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells.
mtdVSV-based vaccines protect BALB/c mice from viremia.
We next determined the protective effect of mtdVSV-based ZIKV
vaccines in both female and male BALB/c mice. Mice were vac-
cinated intranasally with a single dose (106 PFU) of each
recombinant virus, and were challenged intravenously with 1 ×
106 PFU of ZIKV Cambodian strain (FSS13025) at week 5 post-
immunization. DNA vaccine (pCI-prM-E) was used as a control
and was given intramuscularly twice (at week 0 and 2). Similar to
the previous observation shown in Fig. 2f, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-
NS1 was the most attenuated virus, experiencing no weight losses
(Supplementary Fig. 9). All other recombinant viruses showed
9–15% weight loss at early time points but weights were recovered
at day 14 (Supplementary Fig. 9). Previously, it was shown that
the administration of anti-IFNAR1 antibody can render BALB/c
mice more susceptible to infection of a mouse-adapted African
ZIKV strain (Dakar 41519)18. Similarly, we passively transferred
1.8 mg of a blocking antibody, anti-IFNAR1, to each mouse 24 h
prior to intravenous challenge with the ZIKV Cambodian strain.
After ZIKV challenge, mice were monitored for 4 weeks. Unex-
pectedly, no significant weight loss or clinical symptoms were
observed in any group including the unvaccinated but challenged
controls (Supplementary Fig. 10).
The dynamics of viremia were monitored every 3–4 days until
day 24 after ZIKV challenge (except the pCI-prM-E group which
was only monitored at days 3 and 7) and detected by real-time
RT-PCR. For the unvaccinated challenged controls, the peak of
viremia was observed at day 3, declined by days 7 and 10, and
cleared by day 14 (Fig. 4a). This was consistent with previous
observations that ZIKV only causes transient viremia in BALB/c
mice17,30. Similarly, mice in the rVSV-G1670A and rVSV-
G1670A-E groups developed viremia, shedding an average of 3.7
logs of ZIKV PFU equivalent RNA/ml in blood samples collected
at day 3 post-challenge (Fig. 4a). In contrast, viremia in most
mice vaccinated with rVSV-G1670A-prM-E, rVSV-G1670A-
prM-E-NS1, and pCI-prM-E groups were under the detection
limit at day 3 (3 and 4 mice in rVSV-G1670A-prM-E and rVSV-
G1670A-prM-E-NS1 had near detection limit level of viremia,
respectively, and 1 mice in pCI-prM-E group had a high level of
viremia) (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 11). In addition, viremia
was under detection limit from days 7 to 24 in these groups
(Fig. 4a). Collectively, these data show that a single dose
vaccination of mtdVSV-based vaccines provides protection
against ZIKV-induced viremia in BALB/c mice. To determine
whether VSV was persistent in the vaccinated mice, brain tissues
were collected at the termination of the study for detection of
VSV. No infectious VSV was detected by plaque assay in any
brain tissues in any group. However, 4–5 log VSV RNAs were
detected in the brains of the rVSV-G1670A, rVSV-G1670A-E,
and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E groups (Fig. 4b). In contrast, nearly no
VSV RNA was detected in the rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 group
(Fig. 4b). Therefore, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 is the most
attenuated of these viruses.
Next, we repeated the above animal experiment and included
rVSV-G1670A-aE
in
the
vaccination.
Recombinant
rVSV-
G1670A-prM-E-NS1 and rVSV-G1670A-aE had no body weight
loss whereas rVSV-G1670A-prM-E had approximately 4.2% body
weight loss at day 7 (Supplementary Fig. 12). High E-specific
antibodies were observed in all animals vaccinated with rVSV-
G1670A-prM-E or rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 at day 28 and
further increased at day 35 post-vaccination (Fig. 4c). Only 1 out
of 5 animals vaccinated with rVSV-G1670A-aE developed E-
specific antibodies from day 7 to 28, and all animals developed E-
specific antibodies at day 35 (Fig. 4c). NS1-specific antibodies
were only detected in rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 group (Fig. 4d).
Upon ZIKV challenge, mice did not exhibit body weight loss
(Supplementary Fig. 13). Mice vaccinated with rVSV-G1670A-
prM-E and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 were protected from
viremia at days 3 (Fig. 4e) and 7 (Fig. 4f) post-challenge whereas
mice received rVSV-G1670A-aE shed high titer of ZIKV RNA in
blood in a level similar to the rVSV-G1670A and saline control
groups.
mtdVSV-based vaccine provides complete protection in A129
mice. Finally, we assessed the protective effect of mtdVSV-based
ZIKV vaccines in A129 mice which lack the type-I interferon
receptor (IFNAR). These mice have been shown to be highly
permissive for both ZIKV47,48 and VSV infection49,50. In fact,
A129 mice are so susceptible to wild-type VSV infection that a
dose of 50 PFU is lethal50. To reduce side effects, an intramus-
cular route was used for VSV vaccination. Since mtdVSV-based
vaccines were significantly attenuated, we chose a dose of 105
PFU for vaccination which was 2000 times higher than the wild-
type VSV lethal dose. Briefly, A129 mice were immunized
intramuscularly with rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1, rVSV-G1670A-
prM-E, or rVSV-prM-E-NS1, and the safety and antibody
response were monitored. We found that rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-
NS1 was completely attenuated in A129 mice, exhibiting no body
weight losses or any abnormal reactions (Fig. 5a). However,
rVSV-prM-E-NS1, which lacks the VSV attenuating mutation,
was virulent in A129 mice, causing 2 deaths at day 7, and mor-
bidity by day 10 that required termination of the others. Mice
immunized with rVSV-G1670A-prM-E lost 20% of their weight
but recovered and remained healthy. As shown in Fig. 5b–g, all
mice in rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E
groups developed high levels of antibody, detected by ELISA
(Fig. 5b, c) and by neutralization assay (Fig. 5d, e) as early as week
1 post-vaccination. Ab titers remained high at week 3 (Fig. 5c, e).
In addition, high levels of NS1-specific Ab were detected at weeks
1 and 3 in the rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 group (Fig. 5f, g). At
week 4 post-immunization, each group was intraperitoneally
challenged with 105 PFU of the ZIKV Cambodian strain. Mice in
the control, unvaccinated challenged group (immunized with the

 empty pCI plasmid) developed severe clinical signs (Fig. 6a) and
had severe body weight loss (Fig. 6b). Because of the severity of
disease in the pCI control group, these mice were terminated at
day 7. In contrast, mice vaccinated with either rVSV-G1670A-
prM-E-NS1 or rVSV-G1670A-prM-E did not exhibit any weight
loss (Fig. 6b) or ZIKV associated clinical symptoms (Fig. 6a).
ZIKV viremia was measured at days 3 and 7 post-challenge by
real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 7a, b). An average of 5.8 log PFU
equivalents of ZIKV was detected in the pCI control group at day
3. Low ZIKV PFU equivalents were detected at day 3 in the
rVSV-G1670A-prM-E group but none in the rVSV-G1670A-
prM-E-NS1 group. At day 7, high levels of ZIKV were detected in
the blood of the pCI control group, whereas no or very low ZIKV
was found in rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 and rVSV-G1670A-
prM-E groups. Similarly, high levels of ZIKV were detected in the
brain, uterus, lung, and spleen of the pCI control group whereas
under or near detection limit level of ZIKV RNA was found in
these organs in the rVSV-G1670A-prM-E and rVSV-G1670A-
prM-E-NS1 groups (Fig. 7c–f). In addition, histologic analysis of
brain tissues showed that rVSV-G1670A-prM-E and rVSV-
G1670A-prM-E-NS1 had completely protected the mice from
ZIKV-induced encephalitis (Fig. 7g). In contrast, severe ence-
phalitis characterized by neuronal necrosis, gliosis, neuronal
satellitosis and neuronophagia with lymphocytic perivascular
cuffing was found in the control group (Fig. 7g). The brain tissues
were used for the detection of VSV RNA. It was found that
VSV RNA was not detectable or near the detection limit in
A129 mice vaccinated with rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 whereas

 approximately 6 log of VSV RNA were detected in rVSV-
G1670A-prM-E group (Fig. 5h), suggesting that rVSV-G1670A-
prM-E-NS1 was significantly more attenuated than rVSV-
G1670A-prM-E. These data demonstrate that a single low dose
of mtdVSV-based vaccines provides complete protection against
ZIKV challenge in A129 mice.
NS1 alone provides partial protection against ZIKV challenge.
We next determined whether NS1 protein alone can induce pro-
tection against a ZIKV challenge. We first used DNA vaccination
approach, as we know that DNA vaccine is safe to A129 mice. The
NS1 gene with anchor C signal peptide was cloned into pCI vector.
Both pCI-prM-E and pCI-NS1 expressed their intended proteins, E
and NS1, in transfected 293T cells (Supplementary Fig. 14). A129
mice were vaccinated intramuscularly with pCI-prM-E or pCI-NS1,
and boosted with the same plasmid two weeks later. Only 1 out of 5
mice in the pCI-prM-E group had E-specific ELISA and neu-
tralizing Ab at week 1 (Fig. 5b, d) but all of them had high levels of
ZIKV E-specific Ab at week 3 (Fig. 5c, e). No ZIKV neutralizing Ab
was detected in pCI-NS1 group even after the boost (Fig. 5d, e), but
Ab to NS1 was detected in 2 out of 5 mice at week 3 (Fig. 5g).
Mice vaccinated with pCI-prM-E were protected from a ZIKV
challenge at week 4 (Fig. 6a, b). Interestingly, 1 of the 5 mice in the
pCI-NS1 group only had 10% weight loss and quickly recovered
(Fig. 6c). The other 4 mice in the pCI-NS1 group exhibited clinical
signs but less severe than the pCI group although they did not have
statistical difference (P > 0.05, t-test) (Fig. 6a). Overall, weight loss in
the pCI-NS1 group was less than the pCI control group (Fig. 6b). At
day 3 post-challenge, the pCI-NS1 group had a level of viremia
similar to the pCI control group (P > 0.05, t-test) (Fig. 7a), but by
day 7 the pCI-NS1 group had significantly less viremia (P < 0.05, t-
test) (Fig. 7b). Similarly, significantly less ZIKV was detected in
spleen, uterus, lung, and brain in the pCI-NS1 group compared to
the pCI control group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01, t-test) (Fig. 7c–f).
Histologic analysis showed that the pCI-NS1 group had less severe
encephalitis compared to the pCI group (Fig. 7g). Collectively, these
data demonstrate that ZIKV NS1 was capable of conferring partial
protection against ZIKV challenge in A129 mice in the absence of
detectable ZIKV neutralizing Ab.
To further improve the protection efficacy of NS1, we recovered
mtdVSV expressing NS1 alone (rVSV-G1670A-NS1) in which the
ZIKV NS1 gene with anchor C was inserted at the gene junction
between G and L genes (Supplementary Fig. 15). Western blot
showed that the NS1 expression in rVSV-G1670A-NS1-infected
cells was significantly higher than pCI-NS1-transfected cells (Fig. 6d).
A pilot experiment showed that rVSV-G1670A-NS1 still caused
considerable weight losses in A129 mice. Thus, we decided to test
the protection efficacy of rVSV-G1670A-NS1 in BALB/c mice.

Fig. 5 MTase-defective rVSV (mtdVSV)-based vaccine induces high levels of ZIKV-specific antibody in A129 mice. A129 mice were immunized
intramuscularly with pCI, pCI-prM-E, or pCI-NS1 at a dose of 50 µg DNA per mouse, and were boosted with the same plasmid at the same dose two weeks
later. For VSV-based vaccines, mice were administered intramuscularly using a single dose (1 × 105 PFU). The body weight for each mouse was evaluated
at indicated time points (a). The average body weights of five mice were shown. At day 7, two out of five mice in rVSV-prM-E-NS1 group were dead
and the other three terminated at day 10. After immunization, blood samples were collected at weeks 1 and 3. ZIKV E-specific antibody was measured by
ELISA at weeks 1 (b) and 3 (c) post-immunization. ZIKV-specific neutralizing Ab was measured at weeks 1 (d) and 3 (e) post-immunization. ZIKV NS1-
specific Ab was measured by ELISA at weeks 1 (f) and 3 (g) post-immunization. ELISA titers shown are GMT of 5 mice ± standard deviation. At the
termination of this experiment, brains were collected and the presence of the VSV RNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR using primers annealing to
the VSV L gene (h). Antibody and viral load data are expressed as the GMT of five mice (black bars). Exact P value (by Student’s t-test) in each panel:

 Briefly, BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly with two
doses (50 µg each) of pCI-NS1 or intranasally with one dose (106
PFU) of rVSV-G1670A-NS1 or rVSV-G1670A-prM-E, and were
challenged intravenously with 106 PFU of ZIKV at week 4 post-
immunization.
We
found
that
rVSV-G1670A-NS1
triggered
significantly higher NS1-specific antibody than pCI-NS1 in mice
(Fig. 6e). As a positive control, recombinant rVSV-G1670A-prM-E
triggered a high level of E-specific antibody (Fig. 6f). At days 3 post-
challenge, mice in rVSV-G1670A-NS1 and pCI-NS1 groups had a
similar level of viremia (P > 0.05, t-test) but were significantly lower
than pCI control (P < 0.05, t-test) (Fig. 6g). As a positive control, the
viremia level in the rVSV-G1670A-prM-E group was below or near
detection limit (Fig. 6g). At day 7 post-challenge, mice in the rVSV-
G1670A-NS1 and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E groups had no detectable
viremia (except one in rVSV-G1670A-NS1 group which was near
the detection limit) whereas mice in pCI and pCI-NS1 groups still
had a significant level of viremia (P < 0.001, t-test) (Fig. 6h). These
results showed that NS1 alone was capable of triggering significant
protection against ZIKV-induced viremia and that rVSV-G1670A-
NS1 had a higher protection efficacy than pCI-NS1.
Validation of the safety and efficacy of rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-
NS1. Finally, we further validated the protection efficacy of rVSV-
G1670A-prM-E-NS1 in A129 mice by monitoring body weight
and viremia for a prolonged time (until day 21 after challenge
with ZIKV). As shown in Fig. 8a, there were no significant
differences in body weight gain among three groups (P > 0.05, t-
test), 105 PFU of rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1, saline, and normal
controls, demonstrating the high safety profile of rVSV-G1670A-
prM-E-NS1 in A129 mice. As expected, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-
NS1 triggered a high level of E-specific (Fig. 8b) and NS1-specific

 (Fig. 8c) antibodies. Upon challenge with ZIKV Cambodian
strain, mouse body weight and viremia were monitored every 1 or
3 days until day 21. Mice that received the saline control were all
dead at day 6 post-challenge (Fig. 8d). The body weight in rVSV-
G1670A-prM-E-NS1 group was indistinguishable with normal
control (P > 0.05, t-test) at all time points (Fig. 8d). Saline control
group developed high levels of ZIKV induced viremia whereas
rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 group had a baseline level of viremia
at day 3 and no detectable viremia between days 3 and 21
(Fig. 8e). Collectively, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 is of high safety
and efficacy against ZIKV infection.
Discussion
The recent pandemic of ZIKV infection has already caused sig-
nificant economic, health, and emotional burdens, highlighting
the urgent need for developing a safe and highly efficacious ZIKV
vaccine. Here, we developed an mtdVSV-based vaccine platform
for ZIKV. We showed that a single dose of live attenuated VSV-
based ZIKV vaccine expressing prM-E or prM-E-NS1 triggered
strong ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibody and T cell immune
responses, and protected BALB/c and A129 mice against ZIKV
challenge. In addition, we showed for the first time that NS1
protein modulates ZIKV-specific T cell immune responses and
that NS1 alone conferred partial protection against ZIKV-induced
viremia in BALB/c mice and lethal ZIKV challenge in A129 mice
in the absence of a neutralizing antibody response. Altogether,
these results demonstrated that this mtdVSV-based ZIKV vaccine
is a highly promising candidate for ZIKV and highlighted that
NS1 plays an important role in regulating immune responses
against ZIKV infection.
VSV is an excellent vaccine vector35. It has an extremely high
level
of
gene
expression
as
well
as
rapid
and
efficient
replication35,51. VSV-based vaccine is most feasible initially for
controlling outbreaks of highly pathogenic agents in situations
where the high risk of the pathogen would outweigh any potential
side effects of the VSV vector. To date, VSV-based vaccine can-
didates have been developed for filoviruses (Ebola virus and
Marburg virus)38–41,52, arenaviruses (Lassa virus and LCMV)
53,54, henipaviruses (Nipah virus and Hendra virus)55,56, and
human coronaviruses (SARS and MERS)57,58. A single dose of
these rVSV-based vaccines has been shown to highly effective in
small animal models as well as nonhuman primates when

Fig. 7 MTase-defective rVSV (mtdVSV)-based vaccine protects A129 mice from viremia and prevents ZIKV replication in vivo. After ZIKV challenge, the
level of viremia in A129 mice was measured by real-time RT-PCR at days 3 (a) and 7 (b) post-challenge. At day 7 post-challenge, all mice were terminated,
brain (c), lung (d), uterus (e), and spleen (f) tissues were harvested and analyzed for ZIKV RNA by real-time RT-PCR. Data shown are GMT of 5 mice.

 administered by the IN, IM, intradermal, or oral routes35. We
now added the rVSV-based ZIKV vaccine candidate to this list.
Although it was recently reported that rVSV with mutated matrix
protein expressing prM-E was capable of generating maternal
antibody that can protect offspring from ZIKV infection42, it is
not known whether immunized animals can be directly protected
from ZIKV challenge. In our study, we systematically screened
the immunogenicity of rVSVs expressing a variety of ZIKV
antigens including E, E truncations, aE, aE truncations, prM-E,
prM-E truncations, prM-E-NS1, and NS1. To our knowledge, this
is first time to utilize co-expression of NS1 with prM-E as
potential antigens in vectored ZIKV vaccine candidates. In
addition, we used viral MTase as a novel approach to attenuate
VSV for delivering ZIKV vaccine. We demonstrated that a single
immunization (IN or IM) with mtdVSV-based vaccine triggered
high levels of ZIKV-specific Ab and T cell immune responses and
provided complete protection against ZIKV challenges in both
BALB/c and highly sensitive A129 mice. In contrast, DNA vac-
cine requires high doses and multiple booster vaccination, and
antibody was undetectable in both BALB/c and A129 mice at
early time points (Figs. 1, 5, and Supplementary Table 1). Our
results suggest that the efficacy of this VSV-based vaccine is much
higher than a DNA vaccine. A VSV-based vaccine offers many
other advantages, including genetic stability, expression of mul-
tiple antigens, low cost, simplicity of production, multiple routes
of administration, and ease of manipulation. During the Ebola
virus outbreaks in Africa in 2013–2016, VSV-based vaccine
(rVSV-EBOV) was successfully used in humans and was found to
be safe and efficacious38–41. In addition, several other VSV-based
vaccine candidates and oncolytic agents are being tested in
human clinical trials. It is likely that more analysis of the safety
and efficacy of VSV as a vector in humans will be forthcoming
soon, which will facilitate the use of VSV-based vaccines in mass
vaccination in the future.
We found that ZIKV NS1 alone can induce partial protection
against ZIKV challenge. In BALB/c mice, both rVSV-G1670A-
NS1 and pCI-NS1 provided substantial protection against vir-
emia in the absence of neutralizing antibody. Overall, the
protective efficacy of mtdVSV-based NS1 vaccine (rVSV-
G1670A-NS1) was higher than the DNA vaccine (pCI-NS1)
approach. The partial protection of pCI-NS1 against lethal
ZIKV challenge was also observed in A129 mice. Overall, the
disease severity, viremia, and virus burden in pCI-NS1 vacci-
nated group were significantly lower than the pCI control group
in A129 mice (P < 0.05), t-test (Figs. 6, 7). The flavivirus NS1 is
a nonstructural glycoprotein that is essential for viral replica-
tion and immune evasion. Previously, it was shown that
immunization with purified NS1 and recombinant NS1 or
passive
administration
of
monoclonal
antibodies
(MAbs)
against NS1 can protect mice against lethal infection by WNV,
JEV, DENV, and YFV23,25,44,59,60. In addition, vaccination with
DENV1, DENV3, or DENV4 NS1 provided substantial cross
protection against a heterologous DENV2 lethal challenge3.
These studies highlight the value of including the NS1 protein
in candidate vaccines for flaviviruses. During revision of our
manuscript, Brault et al. reported that intramuscular immuni-
zation of immunocompetent mice with the Modified Vaccinia
Ankara (MVA) vector expressing NS1 (MVA-ZIKV-NS1)
vaccine candidate provided 100% protection against a lethal
intracerebral dose of ZIKV (strain MR766)61. However, their

 study did not evaluate the efficacy of MVA-ZIKV-NS1 in A129
mice which is more highly sensitive to ZIKV infection.
The finding that NS1 conferred partial protection against ZIKV
infection highlights an alternative strategy to design ZIKV vac-
cine. Current efforts on development of ZIKV subunit vaccines
have been exclusively focused on prM and E proteins which rely
on generating high levels of neutralizing Ab. However, it has been
reported that anti-flavivirus Abs are cross-reactive with other
species of flavivirus which may facilitate ZIKV infection through
the antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) mechanism62–64.
Since NS1 is absent in the virion, Ab against NS1 will not neu-
tralize ZIKV, but it may provide an alternative antigen for vaccine
development because it avoids the potential risk of disease
enhancement65–67.
We also found that NS1 played an important role in mod-
ulating ZIKV-specific immune responses. The expression of E
protein from prM-E-NS1 constructs (both rVSV and rVSV-
G1670A vector) was delayed compared to the prM-E constructs,
which was probably due to the difference in size of the poly-
protein and proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein. Importantly,
rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 induced significantly higher Th2
cytokines (CD4+IL-5+ and CD4+IL-10+) and Th17 response
(CD4+IL-17A+) than rVSV-G1670A-prM-E (P < 0.05, t-test).
This suggests that co-expression of NS1 regulated ZIKV-specific
T cell immune response which is critical for virus clearance68,69.
Another advantage of rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 is that it trig-
gered a high level of NS1 antibody which may contribute to
protection, perhaps through Fc receptor dependent mechanism.
In fact, the viremia in rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 was statistically
lower than rVSV-G1670A-prM-E (P = 0.0236, t-test) at day 3
post-challenge in A129 mice (Fig. 7a), suggesting that rVSV-
G1670A-prM-E-NS1 may have a greater protective efficacy.
Either the higher T cell immune response or the NS1 Ab could
contribute to the enhanced protection against ZIKV infection.
One of the major concerns of VSV-based vaccines is safety,
particularly since VSV is neurotropic. In this study, we utilized
MTase as a novel approach to attenuate VSV, since mRNA cap
methylation will diminish viral protein translation which in turn
would diminish viral replication45,46,70. We chose rVSV carrying
a single point mutation in the SAM binding site (rVSV-G1670A)
as a backbone which was specifically defective in G-N-7 but not
2′-O methylation45. If necessary, we can choose mutations (such
as K1651A and D1762A) in MTase active site lacking both G-N-7
and 2′-O methylation, which will further enhance the safety of
the VSV vector46,70. We showed that recombinant rVSV-
G1670A-prM-E-NS1
and
rVSV-G1670A-prM-E
were
sig-
nificantly more attenuated in mice than wild type expressing the
same ZIKV genes. Particularly, a dose of 105 PFU of rVSV-
G1670A-prM-E-NS1 was completely attenuated in A129 mice
whereas rVSV-prM-E-NS1 still caused mortality. In addition, we
found that co-expression of NS1 with prM-E offered the addi-
tional benefit of further VSV attenuation. In all cases, prM-E-NS1
constructs were significantly more attenuated than prM-E con-
structs in mice.
In summary, we have developed a novel mtdVSV-based vac-
cine co-expressing prM, E, and NS1 proteins which is safe and
highly efficacious in mice models. This study also highlights a
major gap in our understanding of the roles of NS1 protein in
regulating ZIKV immune response and protection.
Methods
Cell lines, viruses, and plasmid construction. BHK-21 cells (ATCC no. CCL-10),
Vero (ATCC no. CCL-81), and 293T cells (ATCC no. CRL-3216) were purchased
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). BSRT7 cells
(kindly provided by Sean Whelan), which stably express T7 RNA polymerase, are
clones of BHK-21 cells. All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM; Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS. ZIKV Cam-
bodian strain (FSS13025) was provided by the World Reference Center for
Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (University of Texas Medical Branch), propa-
gated in Vero cells, and titrated using a standard plaque assay71. Plasmids encoding
VSV N (pN), P (pP), and L (pL) genes, and an infectious cDNA clone of the viral
genome, pVSV1(+), were generous gifts from Gail Wertz72. Plasmid pVSV1(+)
GxxL, which contains SmaI and XhoI at the G and L gene junction, was kindly
provided by Sean Whelan. The full-length envelope (E) gene (from amino acids
1–504) and E truncation mutants [E404 (amino acids 1–404); E414 (amino acid 1-
414), and E415 (amino acid 1–415)] lacking the predicted stem-transmembrane
domain (TM) were amplified from an infectious cDNA clone of ZIKV Cambodian
strain (GenBank accession no. MH158236) by high fidelity PCR. These DNA
fragments were digested with SmaI and XhoI and cloned into pVSV(+)GxxL at the
same sites. The resulting plasmids were designated pVSV(+)-E, pVSV(+)-E404,
pVSV(+)-E414, and pVSV(+)-E415. Using the same strategy, the anchor C (signal
peptide) with E, E404, E414, and E415 were cloned into pVSV(+)GxxL at SmaI
and XhoI sites resulted in construction of pVSV(+)-aE, pVSV(+)-aE404, pVSV
(+)-aE414, and pVSV(+)-aE415 respectively. In addition, the anchor C-
premembrane-envelope (prM-E), and anchor C-prM-E truncation mutants (prM-
E404, prM-E414, and prM-E415), and anchor C-premembrane-envelope-
nonstructural protein 1 (prM-E-NS1) genes were cloned into pVSV(+)GxxL at
SmaI and XhoI sites. The resulting plasmids were designated pVSV(+)-prM-E,
pVSV(+)-prM-E404, pVSV(+)-prM-E414, pVSV(+)-prM-E,415, and pVSV
(+)-prM-E-NS1. Similarly, the anchor C-NS1 gene (amino acids 1-352) was cloned
into pVSV(+)GxxL at the SmaI and XhoI sites, and the resultant plasmid was
named pVSV(+)-NS1. To further attenuate the VSV vector, we took advantage of a
point mutation, G1670A, in the large (L) polymerase protein, which rendered a
recombinant virus that is specifically defective in mRNA cap G-N-7, but not 2′-O
methylation. Using site-directed mutagenesis, G1670A mutation was introduced
into pVSV(+)-E, pVSV(+)-aE, pVSV(+)-prM-E, pVSV(+)-prM-E-NS1, and
pVSV(+)-NS1 which resulted in the construction of pVSV(+)-G1670A-E, pVSV
(+)-G1670A-aE, pVSV(+)-G1670A-prM-E, pVSV(+)-G1670A-prM-E-NS1, and
pVSV(+)-G1670A-NS1 respectively. To prepare DNA vaccine plasmids, the
anchor C-prM-E and anchor C-NS1 genes were cloned into pCI vector (Promega)
which resulted in the construction of pCI-prM-E and pCI-NS1 respectively. All of
the constructs were confirmed by sequencing.
Recovery of recombinant VSV expressing ZIKV antigens. Recovery of recom-
binant VSV (rVSV) from the infectious clone was carried out as described pre-
viously72. Briefly, rVSV was recovered by cotransfection of plasmid encoding VSV
genome, and support plasmids encoding VSV nucleocapsid complex (pN, pP, and
pL) into BSRT7 cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF7-3)
expressing T7 RNA polymerase (kindly provided by Dr. Bernard Moss). At 96 h
post-transfection, cell culture fluids were collected and filtered through a 0.2-µm
filter, and the recombinant virus was further amplified in BSRT7 cells. Subse-
quently, the viruses were plaque purified as described previously72. Individual
plaques were isolated, and seed stocks were amplified in BSRT7 cells. The viral titer
was determined by a plaque assay performed in Vero cells.
RT-PCR. Viral RNA was extracted from recombinant VSVs by using an RNeasy
minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ZIKV
genes were amplified by a One Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) using primers annealing
to VSV G gene at position 4524 (5′-CGAGTTGGTATTTATCTTTGC-3′) and L
gene at position 4831 (5′-GTACGTCATGCGCTCATCG-3′) (numbering refers to
the complete VSV Indiana genome sequence). The amplified products were ana-
lyzed on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced.
Single-cycle growth curves. Confluent BSRT7 cells were infected with individual
viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3. After 1 h of absorption, the
inoculum was removed, the cells were washed twice with Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM), fresh DMEM (supplemented with 2% fetal bovine
serum) was added, and the infected cells were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots of the
cell culture fluid were removed at the indicated intervals, and virus titers were
determined by plaque assay in Vero cells.
Analysis of the expression of ZIKV antigens by VSV. Confluent BSRT7 cells
were infected with rVSV expressing ZIKV antigens, parental rVSV, or rVSV-
G1670A at an MOI of 3.0 as described above. After 3 h post-infection, cells were
washed with methionine- and cysteine-free (M- C-) medium and incubated with
fresh M- C- medium supplemented with actinomycin D (15 µg/ml). After 1 h of
incubation, the medium was replaced with M- C- medium supplemented with
EasyTag 35S-Express (4 µCi/ml; Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA). After 4 h of incu-
bation, cytoplasmic extracts were prepared and analyzed by sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as described previously70.
Labeled proteins were detected using a phosphorimager. The original uncropped
images of SDS-PAGE are shown in Supplementary Figure 21.
Detection of ZIKV antigen by western blot. BSRT7 cells were infected with each
rVSV expressing ZIKV antigen as described above. For DNA vaccine plasmid,

 HEK293T cells were transfected with pCI, pCI-prM-E, or pCI-NS1 using lipo-
fectimine 2000. At the indicated times post-infection, cell culture medium was
harvested and clarified at 4500 × g for 15 min and further concentrated at 35,000 ×
g for 1.5 h. In the meantime, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 5% β-
mercaptoethanol, 0.01% NP-40, and 2% SDS. Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-
PAGE and transferred to a Hybond enhanced chemiluminescence nitrocellulose
membrane (Amersham) in a Mini Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-
Rad). The blot was probed with rabbit anti-ZIKV E (Cat. No. ZEND20-A, Alpha
diagnostic Intl Inc., San Antonio, TX) or NS1 antibody (Cat. No. ZNS111-S, Alpha
diagnostic Intl Inc.) at a dilution of 1:2000, followed by horseradish peroxidase-
conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Cat. No. sc-2030, Santa Cruz)
at a dilution of 1:5000. The blot was developed with SuperSignal West Pico che-
miluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific) and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR
film. All original uncropped images of western blot are shown in Supplementary
Figs. 16–23.
Production and purification of ZIKV VLPs by a VSV vector. Recombinant
rVSV-E, rVSV-prM-E, or rVSV-prM-E-NS1 was inoculated into 10 confluent T150
flasks of BSRT7 cells at an MOI of 0.01 in a volume of 2 ml of DMEM. At 1 h
postabsorption, 20 ml of DMEM (supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum) was
added to the cultures, and infected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24–48 h. Cell
culture fluids were harvested when extensive cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed.
Cell culture fluids were clarified by centrifugation at 3000×g for 30 min. Virus was
concentrated through a 40% (wt/vol) sucrose cushion by centrifugation at 30,000×g
for 2 h at 4 °C in a Ty 50.2 rotor (Beckman). The pellet was resuspended in NTE
buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA [pH 7.4]) and further purified
through a CsCl isopycnic gradient by centrifugation at 35,000×g for 18 h at 4 °C in
an SW55 rotor (Beckman). The final pellet was resuspended in 0.3 ml of NTE
buffer. Purified ZIKV VLPs were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, western blotting, and
electron microscopy. The protein concentrations of the VLPs were measured by
using the Bradford reagent (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO).
Purification of ZIKV. Ten confluent T150 flasks of Vero cells were infected with
ZIKV Cambodian strain at an MOI of 0.01 in a volume of 2 ml of DMEM. After 1 h
of absorption, 20 ml of DMEM (supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum) was
added, and infected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. When extensive cyto-
pathic effect (CPE) was observed, cell culture fluids were harvested for ZIKV
purification, which was the same procedure as VLP purification mentioned above.
Transmission electron microscopy. Negative-staining electron microscopy of
purified VLPs and ZIKV was performed as described previously. Briefly, 20 µl of
VLP or ZIKV suspension was fixed in copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences,
Inc.) and negatively stained with 1% ammonium molybdate. Virus particles were
visualized by using a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit transmission electron microscope (TEM)
at 80 kV at the Microscopy and Imaging Facility at The Ohio State University.
Images were captured on a MegaView III side-mounted charge-coupled-device
camera (Soft Imaging System, Lakewood, CO), and figures were processed using
Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA).
Animal experiments. All mice were housed within ULAR facilities of The Ohio
State University under approved Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) guidelines (protocol no. 2009A0160). Each inoculation group
was separately housed in rodent cages under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions.
Experiment 1: determine whether VSV constructs are immunogenic in BALB/c
mice. Sixty 4 to 6-week-old specific-pathogen-free female BALB/c mice (Charles
River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were randomly divided into 12 groups (5
mice per group). Mice in group 1 were inoculated with parental rVSV (with no
insertion). Mice in groups 2–10 were inoculated with nine different rVSVs
expressing ZIKV antigens (rVSV-E404, rVSV-E414, rVSV-E415, rVSV-E, rVSV-
prM-E404, rVSV-prM-E414, rVSV-prM-E415, rVSV-prM-E, and rVSV-prM-E-
NS1). Mice in group 11 were inoculated with DMEM and served as uninfected
controls (the normal control). Mice in group 12 were immunized with DNA
vaccine pCI-prM-E. For VSV, each mouse was inoculated intranasally at a dose of
1 × 106 PFU in a volume of 50 µl. For DNA vaccine, mice were immunized
intramuscularly with 50 µg of pCI-prM-E, and boosted with same dose two weeks
later. After inoculation, the animals were evaluated twice every day for mortality
and the presence of any symptoms of VSV infection. The severity of clinical signs
associated with VSV infection was scored based on the following criteria: grade 3
(severe) was characterized by ruffled fur, hyperexcitability, tremors, circling, and
paralysis; grade 2 (moderate) was characterized by ruffled fur with neurological
symptoms such as circling; grade 1 (mild) was characterized by ruffled fur but no
neurological symptoms; grade 0 was defined as no symptoms. The body weight of
each mouse was monitored every three days. Blood samples were collected from
each mouse weekly by bleeding facial vein, and serum was isolated for antibody
detection. At week 5 post-inoculation, all mice were euthanized.
Experiment 2: determine antibody and T cell immune responses triggered by
mtdVSV in BALB/c mice. Thirty 6-week-old SPF female BALB/c mice (Charles
River Laboratories) were randomly divided into six groups (5 mice per group).
Mice in group 1 were inoculated with DMEM and served as unimmunized controls
(normal control). Mice in groups 2–6 were immunized with rVSV, rVSV-G1670A,
rVSV-G1670A-E, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E, and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1. All mice
were immunized intranasally at a dose of 1 × 106 PFU per mouse. After
immunization, the animals were evaluated daily for body weight, mortality, and the
presence of any symptoms of VSV infection. Blood samples were collected from
each mouse weekly by bleeding facial vein, and serum was isolated for antibody
detection. At week 5 post-inoculation, all mice were euthanized, and whole blood
and spleens were isolated from each mouse for a T cell assay.
Experiment 3: determine whether mtdVSV vaccine can protect BALB/c mice
against viremia until day 24 after ZIKV challenge. Seventy 4-week-old SPF BALB/c
mice (Charles River Laboratories) were randomly divided into 7 groups (10 per
group, 5 female and 5 male). Mice in groups 1–5 were immunized with DMEM,
rVSV-G1670A, rVSV-G1670A-E, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E, or rVSV-G1670A-prM-
E-NS1. Mice in group 6 were immunized with DNA vaccine. Mice in group 7 were
served as normal control (immunized with DMEM and unchallenged). For VSV,
mice were inoculated intranasally at a dose of 1 × 106 PFU per mouse. For DNA
vaccine, mice were immunized intramuscularly with 50 µg of pCI-prM-E, and
boosted with same dose 2 weeks later. After immunization, the presence of any
VSV symptom induced by mtdVSV-based ZIKV vaccine candidates was evaluated
twice a day. At week 5 post-immunization, mice in groups 1–6 were challenged
intravenously with ZIKV Cambodian strain at a dose of 1 × 106 PFU per mouse. At
24 h prior to ZIKV challenge, mice were intraperitoneally administered 1.8 mg of
anti-IFNAR1 (Leinco Technologies, Fenton, MO) blocking antibody. After
challenge, the animals were evaluated twice daily for mortality and the presence of
any symptoms of ZIKV infection. The body weight for each mouse was monitored
daily. At day 24 post-challenge, all mice from each group were euthanized. The
blood, brain, lungs, liver, and spleen from each mouse were collected for virus
quantification and histologic evaluation.
Experiment 4: determine whether mtdVSV vaccine can protect BALB/c mice
against viremia until day 7 post-challenge. Mice (6-week-old) in groups 1–5 were
immunized with saline, rVSV-G1670A, rVSV-G1670A-aE, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E,
or rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1. The mice in group 6 served as a normal control
(unimmunized unchallenged). The experimental procedure was identical to
Experiment 3 except the mice were euthanized at day 7 after challenge with ZIKV
Cambodian strain.
Experiment 5: determine whether mtdVSV vaccine and DNA vaccine can
protect A129 mice against ZIKV challenge. Thirty five 6-week-old female A129
mice (Jackson Laboratories) were randomly divided into 7 groups (5 per group).
Mice in groups 1–3 were immunized intramuscularly with pCI, pCI-prM-E, or
pCI-NS1 at a dose of 50 µg DNA per mouse. Two weeks later, mice in groups 1–3
were boosted intramuscularly with the same plasmid at the same dose. Mice in
groups 4–6 were administered intramuscularly using a single dose (1 × 105 PFU per
mouse) of rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1, rVSV-prM-E-NS1, or rVSV-G1670A-prM-
E. Mice in group 7 were served as unvaccinated unchallenged control. After
immunization, mice were evaluated every three days for body weight. The safety of
mtdVSV-based ZIKV vaccine candidates was evaluated twice a day. Blood samples
were collected at week 1 and 3 from each mouse for detection of antibody. At week
4 post-immunization, mice in groups 1–6 were intraperitoneally challenged with
ZIKV Cambodian strain at a dose of 1 × 105 PFU per mouse. After challenge, the
animals were evaluated twice every day for mortality and the presence of any
symptoms of ZIKV infection. The severity of clinical disease was scored based the
following criteria: 1 = heathy; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; and 4 = severe, and early
removal is required. The body weight for each mouse was monitored daily. Blood
was collected at days 3 and 7 for the detection of viremia. At day 7 post-challenge,
all mice from each group were euthanized, and brain, lungs, uterus/ovary, and
spleen from each mouse were collected for virus quantification and histologic
evaluation.
Experiment 6: determine whether NS1 alone can protect BALB/c mice against
viremia. Twenty five 4-week-old female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into 5
groups (5 per group). Mice in groups 1–5 were immunized with DMEM, pCI, pCI-
NS1, rVSV-G1670A-NS1, or rVSV-G1670A-prM-E. For VSV, mice were
inoculated intranasally at a dose of 1 × 106 PFU per mouse. For DNA vaccine, mice
were immunized intramuscularly with 50 µg of plasmid, and boosted with same
dose two weeks later. At week 4 post-immunization, mice in groups 2–6 were
intravenously challenged with ZIKV Cambodian strain at a dose of 1 × 106 PFU per
mouse. At 24 h prior to ZIKV challenge, mice were intraperitoneally administered
1.8 mg of anti-IFNAR1 (Leinco Technologies) blocking antibody. At days 3 and 7
post-challenge, blood was collected from each mouse for detection of viremia by
real-time RT-PCR.
Experiment 7: validate the safety and immunogenicity of rVSV-G1670A-prM-
E-NS1 in A129 mice. There were three groups in this study. Mice in group 1 were
immunized intramuscularly with a single dose (1 × 105 PFU per mouse) of rVSV-
G1670A-prM-E-NS1. Mice in groups 2 and 3 were served as unimmunized
challenged control and normal control (unimmunized unchallenged). Blood was
collected from each mouse weekly for antibody detection. At week 4, mice in
groups 1 and 2 were intraperitoneally challenged with ZIKV Cambodian strain at a
dose of 1 × 105 PFU per mouse. After challenge, mice were monitored for body
weight changes and viremia every 1 or 3 days for 21 days.

 (MyBioSource, Inc., San Diego, CA) (4 µg/ml, in 50 mM Na2CO3 buffer, pH 9.6)
per well at 4 °C overnight, and then blocked with Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA, 1%
W/V in PBS, 100 µl/well) at 37 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, individual serum samples
were tested for ZIKV-specific Ab on antigen-coated plates. Briefly, serum samples
were 2-fold serially diluted and added to E or NS1 protein-coated wells. After
incubation at room temperature for 2 h, the plates were washed five times with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-Tween (0.05%), followed by incubation with 50 µl
of goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary Abs
(Sigma) at a dilution of 1:2000 for 1 h. Plates were washed, developed with 100 µl of
3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), stopped by 100 µl of H2SO4 (2 mol/L), and
the optical density (OD) at 450 nm was determined by BioTek microplate reader.
Endpoint titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that had
an absorbance value 2.1-folds greater than the background level (DMEM control).
Ab titers were calculated by the geometric mean titers (GMT).
Detection of ZIKV neutralizing Ab. ZIKV-specific neutralizing Ab was deter-
mined using a microneutralization (MN) assay as described with modifications17.
Briefly, serum samples were serially diluted twofold in 96-well micro-plates, and
100 μl of virus solution containing 50 PFU of ZIKV-Cambodian strain was added
to 100 μl of each serum dilution and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The mixtures were
then transferred to 24-well plates containing confluent Vero cell monolayers. After
incubation for 60 h at 37 °C, cells were fixed with 4% (vol/vol) phosphate-buffered
paraformaldehyde for 1 h and washed three times with PBS. After permeation by
0.4% (vol/vol) Triton-X 100 at room temperature for 20 min and washed for three
times, a ZIKV E monoclonal antibody (MyBioSource, Inc.) was added to each well
at a dilution of 1:1000 and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by washing with PBS
three times. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary
antibody (Santa Cruz) at a dilution of 1:2000 was added to each well and incubated
at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS for three times. The plates were then
developed with 3-Amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) substrate for 1 h at room tem-
perature and stained plaques in each well were counted under light microscope.
The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of neutralizing antibody in mice
serum was calculated based on the number of plaques in each well compared with
the average value of DMEM group.
Analysis of ZIKV-specific T cell responses. To determine the nature of T cell
responses that supported the development of ZIKV-specific Ab responses by rVSV
expressing ZIKV antigens, we analyzed cytokine production by ZIKV E-specific
spleen T cells. More specifically, spleen cells were aseptically removed from mice
35 days after immunization, and minced by pressing through a cell strainer. Red
blood cells were removed by incubation in 0.84 % ammonium chloride and, fol-
lowing a series of washes in RPMI 1640, cells were resuspended in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM
HEPES, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum.
The cell concentrations were adjusted to 3 × 106 cells/mL and 100 µl were added
into each well (3 wells per spleen sample) of a 96-well microtiter plate and cultured
either alone or in the presence of 20 µg/ml of ZIKV E protein for 5 days at 37 °C in
a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Culture supernatants were collected from each well and
frozen at −80 °C until analysis of secreted cytokines using the Bio-Plex Pro Mouse
Cytokine Standard 23-Plex, Group I (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc, Hercules, CA) per
manufacturer’s instructions. The frequencies of ZIKV-specific Th1 (IFN-α+CD4
+CD3+ and TNF-β+CD4+CD3+), Th2 cells (IL-4+CD4+CD3+, IL-5+CD4+CD3
+), Th17 (IL-17A+ CD4+ CD3+), and Tfh (IL-21+ CD4+ CD3+) cells were
determined by intracellular staining with the corresponding anti-cytokine Abs (at a
dilution of 1:5000) after additional incubation in the presence of PMA and iono-
mycin. Cytokine-specific antibodies including Alexa Fluor 700 anti-CD3 (Cat. No.
100216), Alexa Fluor 750 anti-CD4 (Cat. No. 100460), Alexa Fluor 488 anti- IFNγ
(Cat. No. 505813), PerCP Cy5.5 anti-TNFα (Cat. No. 506322), PE anti-IL-5 (Cat.
No. 504307), Alexa Fluor 647 anti-IL-21 (Cat. No. 516803), PECy7 anti-IL-10 (Cat.
No. 505026), Brilliant Violet 650 anti-IL-17 (Cat. No. 506929), Brilliant Violet 605
anti-IL-4 (Cat. No. 504125) were purchased from Biolegend (San Diego, CA). The
cells were then analyzed with the aid of an Attune flow cytometer and data were
expressed as mean % positive cells ± standard deviation.
Measurement of viral burden. At indicated time points after ZIKV challenge,
blood was collected and organs were recovered. Organs were weighed and
homogenized using a bead-beater apparatus (MagNA Lyser, Roche). The total
RNA was extracted from tissue samples and blood by using TRIzol Reagent (Life
technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Reverse transcription (RT) was conducted using a
primer (5′-CTCGTCTCTTCTTCTCCTTCCTAGCATTGA-3′) targeting the cap-
sid (C) gene of ZIKV and the Superscript III transcriptase kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). The RT products were then used to perform real-time PCR using primers
specifically targeting the E gene of ZIKV (forward, 5′-CATCAGGATGGTCT
TGGCGATTCTAGC-3′; reverse, 5′-CTCGTCTCTTCTTCTCCTTCCTAGCATT
GA-3′) in a StepOne real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). A standard curve
was generated using a serial dilution of ZIKV RNA extracted from known PFU titer
of infectious virus. Amplification cycles used were 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C,
and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. The threshold for detection of
fluorescence above the background was set within the exponential phase of the
amplification curves. For each assay, 10-fold dilutions of standard viral RNA were
generated, and negative-control samples and double-distilled water (ddH2O) were
included in each assay. Viral burden is expressed on a log10 scale as viral RNA
equivalents per gram or per milliliter. Similarly, total RNA from brain tissues was
used for quantification of VSV RNA using primers annealing to the VSV L gene
and shown as RNA copies per gram, using a plasmid encoding VSV genome as a
standard curve.
Histology. Half of the tissues (brain, lung, uterus/ovary, and spleen) from each
experiment were preserved in 4% (vol/vol) phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde.
Fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 µm, and stained with
hematoxylin-eosin (HE) for the examination of histological changes by light
microscopy. The pathologist was blinded to each group.
Quantitative and statistical analyses. Quantitative analysis was performed either
by densitometric scanning of autoradiographs or by using a phosphorimager
(Typhoon; GE Healthcare) and ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare, Piscat-
away, NJ). All experiments were three replicates. No animals or samples were
excluded from the analysis. Data were collected and assessed blindly for each group
allocation during the experiment. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way
multiple comparisons using SPSS 8.0 statistical analysis software (SPSS Inc., Chi-
cago, IL). A P value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All materials,
reagents, and data reported in this manuscript are available from the authors upon
