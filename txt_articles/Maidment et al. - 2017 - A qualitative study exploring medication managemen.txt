Abstract
Background: The prevalence of dementia is increasing rapidly. People with dementia 
may be prescribed complex medication regimens, which may be challenging for them 
and any carers involved to safely manage.
Objective: To describe and understand the key challenges, in relation to medication 
issues, experienced by people with dementia and their informal carers dwelling in the 
community and the potential role of community pharmacists.
Design: Qualitative semi- 
structured interviews.
Participants: People with dementia, informal carers and health and social care profes-
sionals (HSCPs).
Results: Thirty- 
one participants (eleven informal carers, four people with dementia 
and sixteen HSCPs) were interviewed. Three key themes were identified: the key chal-
lenges, improving medication management and the role of pharmacists. The caring 
role commonly included responsibility for medication management which created 
both practical problems and an emotional burden. This burden was worsened by any 
difficulty in obtaining support and if the person with dementia was on a complex regi-
men. Participants believed that the process could be improved by coordinated and 
on- 
going support from HSCPs, which should focus on the informal carer. Medication 
reviews, particularly when conducted in the home environment, could be helpful.
Conclusion: Medication management for people with dementia living in the community 
is a complex process, and informal carers have a key role, which they frequently find 
challenging. Community pharmacists could have an enhanced role in this area, but would 
need to work within a more multidisciplinary environment outside the pharmacy.

1 | INTRODUCTION
It is estimated that dementia has a global prevalence of 47.5 mil-
lion individuals.1 In the UK, 800 000 people live with dementia – this 
figure is expected to double by 2040 reflecting global predictions.1,2 
The presence of dementia potentially increases the likelihood of the 
presence for risk factors for adverse drug reactions such as lack of 
pharmacy input, drug interactions, comorbidity and polypharmacy, 
 930  |    
MAIDMENT ET Al.
amongst others.3–6 The cognitive impairment characteristic of de-
mentia may result in a lack of capacity to safely self- 
administer 
medication.7,8 Despite people with dementia being particularly 
susceptible to adverse drug events, they are commonly prescribed 
complex medication regimes and on average receive five different 
medicines.7,9
Medication management “is the entire way that medicines are 
selected, procured, delivered, prescribed, administered and reviewed 
to optimize the contribution that medicines make to producing in-
formed and desired outcomes of patient care”.10 With increasing 
cognitive impairment, the core symptom of dementia, medication 
management is often shifted from the personal responsibility of the 
person with dementia to the control of formal (paid) or informal (fam-
ily) carers particularly with complex regimens.11–15 Informal carers 
often have a key role in ensuring safe and effective medication use as 
they may conduct up to 10 medication management activities every 
day, including awareness of and managing side- 
effects, and decisions 
to administer medication.16,17 Previous research has identified the 
role of informal carers as advocates and their potential contribution 
to patient safety.18 Unlike health professionals, family and friends 
who are informal carers may not receive any training or have access 
to evidence- 
based information to appropriately support medication 
management.17,19 In fact, informal carers may not feel equipped for 
such an augmented role which they can find burdensome and stress-
ful and this in turn may affect the informal carer’s and the person with 
dementia’s quality of life.20–24
Without the support and collaboration of health professionals in-
volved, informal carers may struggle to adequately support medication 
management especially of complex regimes.8 However, some health- 
care professionals lack time and awareness of the administration 
practicalities and the realities of informal carers and people with de-
mentia.25,26 Furthermore, the information about medication regimens, 
provided by health- 
care professionals, can be complex and sometimes 
is not directly communicated to the informal carer due to the restric-
tion of confidential information.17,19,26
The role of community pharmacists is changing from being focused 
on the supply of medicines to providing clinical services.27,28 These 
services are focused on helping patients obtain the optimal benefit 
from prescribed medication by advising other clinicians and working 
directly with patients and others.29–32 The change in role is supported 
by national and international policy.29,33 The available literature argues 
that community pharmacy services available for people with dementia 
are poorly developed and the need for further research on ways to 
optimize medication management in people with dementia living in 
the community has been identified.25,34
It is important then to explore the perspectives of the key stake-
holders, including informal carers and people with dementia, to under-
stand how community pharmacists can support people with dementia 
living in the community with safe medication management. The objec-
tives of the study were to describe and understand the key challenges, 
in relation to medication issues, experienced by people with dementia 
and their informal carers dwelling in the community, and the potential 
role of community pharmacists.
2 | METHODS
2.1 | Design
An exploratory qualitative study design that followed Consolidated 
Criteria for Reporting Qualitative studies (COREQ) guidelines35 was 
employed (see appendix for further details). A focus group conducted 
at the Alzheimer’s Society and involving informal carers had previ-
ously identified the need for research in this area.26
2.2 | Participants and recruitment
Participants were recruited from the Alzheimer’s Society, Dementia 
UK, local General Practice (GP) surgeries, professional networks and 
local dementia support groups (including a support group for people 
with dementia from the Black and Minority Ethnic [BME] community 
in Yorkshire). The institutions were contacted by LA and IM via tel-
ephone and email and were enquired about their willingness to col-
laborate in advertising the study. Recruitment was also conducted 
through snowball effect as contacts were requested to suggest other 
people with dementia, informal carers and HSCPs who might be will-
ing to take part in this study.
2.3 | Data collection
Semi- 
structured face- 
to- 
face interviews were conducted. Two inter-
view guides were used: one for people with dementia and their infor-
mal carers and one for HSCPs (see appendix for further details). This 
was the selected type of interview as it gives participants the oppor-
tunity to expand their answers freely and to provide in- 
depth reflec-
tions about their lived experiences. Furthermore, it allowed obtaining 
data that were suitable for conducting a Framework analysis. On 
three occasions, both the informal carer and the person with demen-
tia were together in the room during the interview. This allowed the 
person with dementia to provide further insight into what the informal 
carer was saying. Each interview lasted between 30 and 60 minutes. 
Interpreters from the same community were used for all the inter-
views with informal carers from the BME community.
2.4 | Inclusion criteria
Informal carers were eligible if:
• They had provided or still provide some sort of assistance with 
medication management to a person who has been diagnosed with 
dementia and is living in the community;
• Did not receive any sort of payment (excluding receipt of carers’ 
allowance).
HSCPs were eligible if:
• They had been in contact with or had been providing assistance to 
people with dementia

2.5 | Data analysis
A qualitative framework analysis was undertaken in order to explore 
the experiences and perspectives of the participants. Framework 
analysis, which has been specifically designed for applied qualitative 
research that commences deductively from specified aims and objec-
tives, was used to organize and make sense of the data.36,37 NVIVO 
software was used to manage the data.
The transcripts were transcribed verbatim. TM and IM inde-
pendently reviewed the transcripts. Disagreements on the interpre-
tation and analysis of the data were then discussed between TM and 
IM. Any disagreements or differences in interpretation of the data 
between TM and IM were resolved, as necessary, with discussions in-
volving the wider team (with AH the final arbiter) until consensus was 
achieved. A systematic cross- 
comparison analysis was undertaken by 
TM, and reviewed by IM to identify the similarities and differences be-
tween the different participants and to develop a set of themes which 
represent the whole corpus of data. TM and IM then discussed and 
agreed the final structure of the matrix for the analysis.
3 | RESULTS
Thirty- 
one participants, eleven informal carers, four people with de-
mentia, sixteen HSCPs (four GPs, five nurses, three social care profes-
sionals [paid formal carers] and four community pharmacists), were 
interviewed. Three main themes were identified. Key challenges expe-
rienced by informal carers and people with dementia (the caring role, 
the challenges of the condition), improving medication management 
in people with dementia (empowerment and communication from 
health professionals) and the role of pharmacists.
3.1 | Key challenges experienced by informal 
carers and people with dementia: the caring role, the 
challenges of the condition
Interviews with informal carers and people with dementia provided 
information on the challenges that they experience in relation to med-
ication management. Nearly half of the carers reported that they had 
no problem in terms of the practicalities of managing the medication. 
Although it is a complex process, by adopting an organized routine, 
carers reported that the practical aspects of managing medication did 
not have any impact on their lives:
So in your opinion, does managing your medication affect 
your daily life 
(question from research associate)?
Not really, no, not really. I’ve got it sussed out. 
(Informal carer; pp3).
No, not really, no. It’s all right if I do it in advance (discuss-
ing organising the medication), you see, I know what to do, 
so… It’s really three times a day I have to remember. But 
then it’s usually when we’re eating, so it’s part of the ritual 
with the food. 
(Informal carer; pp4).
Some (but not all) informal carers stated that compliance packs could 
help them organize the medication:
Before this sort of thing came out which I didn’t know 
about, they came in a small bottle and, obviously, you 
have to take certain ones at certain times. Well, I used 
to get into a right two and eight (Cockney rhyming slang 
for a state). And it…well, it just was a muddle. And then 
(community pharmacy chain), I used to go to (community 
pharmacy chain), and then they started putting them into 
packs like this. 
(Informal carer; pp2).
However, there is still frequently an emotional burden associated 
with medication management and carers expressed an obligation to 
being responsible for managing the medication of the person they are 
looking after; this included prioritizing the health of the person they 
cared for over their own health:
Sometimes I feel fed up but what can I do? That is my 
 
duty…I forget my medicine but I never forget his 
(Informal carer; pp27).
On further exploration, informal carers linked this burden to the fact 
that the medication was not improving the behaviours and cognitive 
problems characteristic of dementia:
I was frustrated with myself. Why? With the medicine and 
she was getting worse and worse…the way she was behav-
ing that I was worried about. 
(Informal carer – pp25).
Ensuring adherence to medication may be difficult. Due to increasing 
cognitive impairment, the person with dementia may not understand the 
need for medication. Again, the difficulties proliferate as the complexity 
of the regimen increases, potentially making the person with dementia 
very dependent on the carer:
I wouldn’t know which ones to take, there’s too many of 
them. 
(Person with dementia; pp1).
I have missed (doses of medication) occasionally. 
(Person with dementia; pp11.)
According to some informal carers, their caring duty was shown to be 
particularly challenging when medication needed to be taken at different 
times of the day:
 932  |    
MAIDMENT ET Al.
So all these [health issues] require medication…It’s keeping 
them separate that is the real problem 
(Informal carer; pp14).
Moreover, keeping track of the supply of medication was also high-
lighted as being a potential difficulty:
Make sure that you got enough tablets to last 
(Informal carer; pp3).
I think the main problem with the medication was having 
to go and get it and remembering, “Oh, there’s only that 
many left of that particular one, I’d better order some 
more.” And I seemed to be up and down there twice a 
week. 
(Informal carer; pp4)
The impact that taking care of the medication of a person with de-
mentia has on the carer may be even more evident when they are forced 
to make decisions about administering medication without sufficient 
support from HSCPs:
And now I discovered we’ve run out of brown (Warfarin) 
and they didn’t bother to give as a prescription for it and 
it was the weekend. And I was going to go to the doctor 
but what I did was I’ve got a pill cutter. (OK). I cut the 
blue into two, I hope that’s the correct dosage, I don’t 
know. 
(Informal carer; pp14).
Lack of access to doctors was seen as a barrier to effective medica-
tion management. Clinicians’ lack of time to address carers’ or patients’ 
concerns was flagged by several informal carers:
This is what I feel I need to see Dr X, I really do. I feel 
that the tablets that she’s on, they are not doing any-
thing. I often wonder, sort of, to experiment and not 
give her any tablets at all for a week and see what the 
outcome would be. But then it might be dangerous. It 
could be you know, she could just fall off the planet. 
This is why I want to speak to him. But it’s like trying to 
see the Pope. 
(Informal carer; pp2).
Thus, informal carers often need to decide whether or not to follow 
instructions, or change the regimen without seeking advice:
[Doctor said] Every three days, but I don’t give it to her 
every three days because it’s a morphine patch, it’s for 
pain. She isn’t saying that she’s…any pain. Following the 
prescription she’d be taking 8 paracetamol a day which I 
think is far too much to be honest with you. 
(Informal carer – pp16).
3.2 | Improving medication management in people 
with dementia: empowerment and communication 
from health professionals
All groups (people with dementia, informal carers and HSCPs) identi-
fied that people with dementia and their informal carers needed more 
support with medication management. Medication management is 
frequently solely dependent on informal carers, and therefore, target-
ing them is the best way to improve the process:
I find organising things in the short term, I find it difficult 
(Person with dementia; pp1).
So that’s where the help needs to be improved, em-
powering carers…You can’t empower the patients be-
cause they’re already losing them (to the symptoms of 
dementia). 
(GP; pp5).
Yet, informal carers may have their own health problems and 
therefore have to manage the medication of two people: them-
selves and the person they care for. The majority of the informal 
carers agreed that having to manage both regimens can be difficult 
as there is:
A lot to think about. Yes. That’s why I like to think about 
and with (the person with dementia cared for) not being 
on the ball, sort of business…I have to think about as 
well. 
(Informal carer - pp3).
HSCPs need to provide clear explanations so that informal carers 
fully understand the treatments in order to decrease the risk of medi-
cation errors:
If they’ve sat there in a consultation and me or anyone 
else…”Oh, they’ve completely got that” and then a few 
months later…although the drug is no longer on…their 
medical records, at home they’ve still got boxes of tablets 
and they’re still taking them and they shouldn’t be 
(GP; pp15)
Therefore, HSCPs should supply:
A little bit more…explanation…and then it’s easier to take 
that in and we’ll keep that in our memories’. 
(Informal carer; pp1)
Furthermore, informal carers believed that medication management 
could be improved if HSCPs:
Listen to the concerns of the relatives 
(Informal carer; pp14)
     |  933
MAIDMENT ET Al.
It was identified by a HSCP that written communication in addition 
to verbal could be used as a way to help ensure that informal carers and 
people with dementia understand their treatment:
Written instructions, pictures and making sure that their…
family understand what to do. 
(Nurse; pp9)
However, this topic needs to be addressed carefully as the infor-
mation needs to be tailored to person with dementia and their infor-
mal carer. It is important to not only provide the right instructions 
for the right illness but make sure that the person has the ability to 
understand the message (as the earlier quote from the GP pp15 also 
highlighted):
It’s crazy. You need a magnifying glass as well as your 
glasses to read it, don’t you? 
(Informal carer; pp1).
HSCPs identified that a coordinated response involving several pro-
fessionals was needed to support medication management:
Well, if they’re having problems taking it at the right time 
then I would say social services because they’d need 
prompting to take it. If it was because they couldn’t open 
bottles or they were getting pills mixed up, because you, 
like, you might get several tablets that look the same. You 
know, so that would be the pharmacist because you need 
identification. If it was because, like with PRN medication, 
you would maybe need a nurse to help them identify when 
they needed certain drugs. 
(Nurse – pp12)
Some informal carers agreed with this idea and added that this sup-
port needs to take into consideration different cultural traditions and 
religions:
Whoever is looking after (the person with dementia) if 
they (clinicians) are not aware of these issues, cultural 
issues, religious issues and traditions…then it’s a big 
problem…you have to build the confidence according to 
their traditions or religion so it plays a major part in that 
situation if you’re not aware (of cultural and religious 
 
aspects)…South Asian people (may) have little knowledge 
about English. 
(Informal carer; pp25)
In addition, medication reviews were viewed as having a poten-
tially positive impact, but clinicians may lack the time to conduct them 
adequately:
In a 20 minute appointment and looking at their medica-
tion is just one part of that…most people will probably say, 
“No, no, its fine, I’m taking them”. But actually, you know, I 
don’t know how in depth we go, really. 
(Nurse; pp7).
Again, it is important that HSCPs coordinate any review and share 
relevant information between themselves to improve the support 
given and the treatment. Failing to do this may lead to several issues:
Although the information does come back to us through 
the GPs, it may not always be the type of information 
that we always want…that patient may not be as well 
 
adherent…and not presenting it to the doctor. 
(Pharmacist; pp23)
According to most of the HSCPs interviewed, medication reviews 
have significant potential to improve medication management but 
should be conducted in the patient’s home so that HSCPs understand 
the full picture of the whole process:
That’s easier isn’t it when you are out there seeing them in 
their home. It’s very difficult when people come in because 
you have no idea really…like I say, things can sound very 
chaotic but actually when you are in there, you think, “Oh, 
no, it’s OK, it’s working”. It’s very difficult when you are not 
actually seeing it for yourself. 
(Nurse; pp7)
Lastly, it was highlighted that medication review should focus on 
decreasing the complexity of the regimen and include any formulation 
issues, which can be a barrier to adherence. The objective of the whole 
process is making the medication regimen easy to follow:
If you’ve got a choice of inhaler but have these twice a 
day…or there’s one that’s once a day you’d, hopefully, go 
for the one that’s once a day one if it carries the appro-
priate medication. So, it’s just simplifying everything…get 
them the best medication possible, make it simple and 
then they are going to use it. 
(Nurse; pp9)
3.3 | The role of pharmacists
HSCPs identified the role of pharmacists in giving advice on medication. 
However, informal carers and people with dementia tended to focus on 
practical aspects of the role, such as home delivery of medication, and 
viewed their role in terms of the supply of medication without mention-
ing or indeed knowing about the clinical roles pharmacists can provide:
Well, it’s got to be the doctors, hasn’t it, and nurses… 
they’re the ones, aren’t they (that provide support for med-
ication management)…rather than the pharmacists…they 
just provide it (medication), don’t they. 
(Informal carer; pp1)
 934  |    
MAIDMENT ET Al.
So how do you think pharmacists could improve support 
to people with dementia and their carers when it comes to 
managing the medication? 
(Question from research associate)
Yes, I mean they could give…they can sort the tablets out 
for them and put them in a pillbox. 
(Informal carer; pp3)
Non- 
pharmacist HSCPs confirmed that people may not be aware of 
the benefits of getting advice from community pharmacists on medica-
tion, which is not the best use of the pharmacists’ skills:
Well, I think we’re very lucky in this country in that we do 
have a community network of expert pharmacists who are 
under- 
utilised, whose expertise is under- 
utilised. 
(GP; pp8)
HSCPs highlighted the need for pharmacists to play a more active 
role in the multidisciplinary team. One way of achieving this would be 
having pharmacists working in GP surgeries:
The main thing is if the pharmacist is attached to the prac-
tice and to the patient that would be great…I mean, why 
haven’t they [doctors] got such good relationships with 
pharmacists… here’s the store of knowledge. 
(GP; pp8).
Additionally, all four community pharmacists argued that having ac-
cess to the patient’s medical records would be a starting point to improve 
the support they provide to people with dementia and their informal 
carers:
Well, I think the community pharmacists are left out of 
the clinical loop, the loop of communication between GPs, 
specialist nurses and the hospital…they don’t realise the 
potential for the community pharmacist to be a referral, 
you know, to co- 
ordinate…If we had access to medical 
records…we’d be better able to support them (i.e. the 
patient/carer). 
(Pharmacist; pp 21)
This idea was explored even further by some participants, and a 
nurse suggested that having a specialist designated/named pharma-
cist with the knowledge to educate could mean better support for 
medication management to people with dementia and their informal 
carers:
Somebody in pharmacies that oversees all dementia 
 
patients…named contact for families that if they are con-
cerned they can contact…who was responsible for that 
patient’s medication. 
(Nurse; pp7)
A further suggestion was made in terms of having community phar-
macists going on home visits in order to understand how people with 
dementia and their informal carers are coping with their medication and 
help to develop strategies to address any issues:
Pharmacist that could go and visit people at home. 
(GP; pp15)
People (who) are alone, or, like, the carer isn’t up to doing 
it, or feeling it’s too much 
(Informal carer; pp4)
Pharmacists recognized that the advice and role they can provide is 
limited without home visits. However, the current funding model may 
not routinely support home medication reviews:
We do not have a commissioned service where we can do 
medicines use reviews at the patient’s home. However, my 
colleagues in the neighbouring (area)…do have it…and it’s 
shown to be a valuable service. 
(Pharmacist; pp23)
4 | DISCUSSION
Medication management for people with dementia living in the com-
munity is often a very complex task and supported by a triad of the 
person with dementia, informal carers and various HSCPs. Informal 
carers have a pivotal role, but yet frequently find managing the medi-
cation of someone with dementia challenging. Indeed, even carers 
who stated that they had everything under control identified a ‘duty 
to cope’ and associated emotional burden. This echoes the findings 
elsewhere where informal carers identified that any failure to cope 
would be viewed as their fault.26,38,39 This challenge increased as the 
complexity of the regimen increases and if the carers lacked adequate 
support, again echoing previous research.11,16,25,26 Limited English 
proficiency also increased the difficulties.5
The challenges associated with medication management for peo-
ple with dementia, their informal carers and the wider society can have 
potentially serious consequences. There is an increased risk of people 
with dementia experiencing a medication error, as clearly seen in the 
accounts from both HSCPs and carers, and previously identified.40 
Making sure that their loved one takes the right medication at the right 
time places a significant emotional burden on the informal carer, which 
is not always acknowledged by the HSCP. Additionally, if informal car-
ers fail to cope, this has wider implications for society because further 
resources such as admission to residential care may be required.21 
Other research on the challenges for informal carers in the manage-
ment of Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) 
also found a ‘sense of shame’ if the carers failed to cope and that the 
burden is often hidden from HSCPs.38,39
As far as we are aware, this is the first study that has focused on 
the barriers to community pharmacists supporting informal carers of 
     |  935
MAIDMENT ET Al.
people with dementia. Other studies have found barriers to a more 
clinical role for community pharmacists in the management of BPSD28 
and pain in people with dementia.41 Similar to our research, the phar-
macists in these studies believed that a lack of training and multidis-
ciplinary working and lack of access to clinical records inhibited their 
input.28,41 Equally importantly, we found, like other research, that 
 
informal carers tended to view the role of pharmacists in terms of 
medication supply.5,26
Other studies have identified high levels of polypharmacy with 
potentially inappropriate prescribing in people with dementia ranging 
from 22%4 to 81.5% of participants.6 We found that medication re-
view focussing on simplifying the regimen might be helpful, particularly 
if delivered in the home environment. However, a systematic review 
found that pharmacist- 
led chronic disease management increased the 
complexity of the medication regimen.42 Ultimately, it is essential that 
HSCPs adopt a person- 
centred approach and pay attention to the chal-
lenges that informal carers and people with dementia face. This should 
include exploring ways to reduce any burden on informal carers associ-
ated with managing medication.
More generally, medicine optimization – defined as a ‘person- 
centred approach to safe and effective medicines use, to ensure peo-
ple obtain the best possible outcomes from their medicines’ – has 
been identified a key priority within primary care.43,44 Further research 
on how to improve outcomes from medication and deliver medicine 
optimization is needed.44 Deprescribing which is considered to be ‘the 
process of withdrawal of inappropriate medication, supervised by a 
health- 
care professional with the goal of managing polypharmacy and 
improving outcomes’ may represent a promising approach to medicine 
optimization.45 However, evidence on the impact of deprescribing in 
older people is equivocal and further evidence from controlled studies 
is required.46
4.1 | Implications for clinicians and policymakers
Clinicians and policymakers need to be aware of the challenges in-
volved and that even informal carers who do not report difficulties 
may be experiencing an emotional burden. Evidence- 
based guidelines 
need to consider this burden, which is worsened as the complexity of 
the regimen increases. There is a potential for community pharma-
cists to work outside the ‘four walls’ of the community pharmacy in 
order to support people with dementia and their informal carers man-
age their medication.47 This ‘work without boundaries’ should include 
medication reviews in the patient’s home, needs full access to clini-
cal records and be coordinated with other medication optimization 
 
activity.48 Whilst home- 
based medication reviews are occurring in 
some areas, this research found inconsistencies between regions. This 
need to review medication in the patient’s own home would equally 
apply to practice- 
based pharmacists.
4.2 | Strengths and weaknesses
The study has a number of potential strengths. Data were triangulated 
from the perspectives of different HSCPs, informal carers and people 
with dementia. Participants were recruited from various locations 
and data saturation was achieved for the complete set of interviews, 
based on criteria from Fusch et al.49
Like all research, there are limitations. Findings are context- 
bound 
to the participants and study setting, like all qualitative research.50 
Although we believe that the testimonies from the participants were 
particularly rich in content, as data were obtained from face- 
to- 
face 
interviews, we cannot avoid the possibility that participants may have 
given socially desirable responses. Only a limited number of partici-
pants from the BME community were interviewed.
4.3 | Future research
Further research would benefit from exploring the perspectives of a 
more diverse sample including people from the BME community; this 
study only included people from the South Asian BME community, 
and people with dementia living alone. A future project could also fol-
low a cohort of people with dementia and their informal carers longi-
tudinally to gain further insights on how the challenges change as the 
dementia progresses.
Ultimately, this research can inform the development of an inter-
vention. Set within the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework, 
a feasibility study of a pharmacist- 
led home medication review in col-
laboration with other HCSPs should be conducted. The intervention 
should be tailored to the specific needs of the person with dementia 
and their informal carer.38,39
5 | CONCLUSIONS
Medication management in people with dementia living in the com-
munity is frequently a very complex process. As dementia develops, 
medication management becomes the responsibility of informal car-
ers, who frequently have little or no medical experience or knowledge. 
Informal carers frequently find this role challenging, particularly when 
the person with dementia lacks an understanding of the need for med-
ication. This challenge was compounded by, at times, limited support 
from HSCPs.
Community pharmacists could potentially develop an enhanced 
role in supporting medication management in this area. The support 
should be delivered in the person’s home, and the informal carer 
should be included in the process. It should include practical support 
to help them organize the medication and develop strategies to avoid 
medication errors, and medication review. Barriers to an expanded role 
include the difficulty accessing pharmacy services; more generally, this 
is an issue, which should receive priority in terms of funding. Informal 
carers may also not be aware of this potential expanded clinical role. 
Community pharmacists would need to develop this role within a mul-
tidisciplinary framework with access to full clinical records.
People with dementia are amongst the most vulnerable members 
of society with needs over and above people with no health issues. 
They therefore need additional support, which needs to be recognized 
by commissioners of services. Appropriate care pathways should be

established to provide this support; community pharmacists can be a 
key element of these pathways.

Semi- 
structured Interview Schedule
1. Interview schedule for informal carers/people with dementia: A qualitative study exploring medication management in people with dementia 
living in the community and the potential role of the community pharmacist
This semi- 
structured interview will consist of open- 
ended questions, which are split into four sections. However, these questions will depend upon how 
much detail the participant wants to give. Due to the sensitive nature of this topic, participants will take some direction over this interview and some 
questions may be missed out or expanded upon. Minor amendments may be made as the interview progresses as issues may arise that the researcher had 
not considered.
INTRODUCTION
Before we begin this interview, could you confirm whether you are caring for someone with dementia?
Thank you for taking part in this interview, I really do appreciate the time you have given. Before we begin, I want to make it clear that if you

care professionals in regard to medication management? If yes, what kind of support would be 
helpful?
How do you feel about the future in terms of support from health- 
care professionals in helping with medication?
Prompt: Do you think health- 
care professionals need to be more involved in supporting people with dementia and their carers manage their 
medication?

2. Interview schedule for health and social care professionals: A qualitative study exploring medication management in people with dementia 
living in the community and the potential role of the community pharmacist
This semi- 
structured interview will consist of open- 
ended questions, which are split into three sections. However, these questions will depend upon how 
much detail the participant wants to give. Participants will take some direction over this interview and some questions may be missed out or expanded 
upon. Minor amendments may be made as the interview progresses as issues may arise that the researcher had not considered.

any explanation for doing so.
Are you happy for me to begin?
Can you tell me what your current role is in regard to caring for people with dementia?
The next few questions are going to be about your experience of reviewing and assisting medication management for dementia patients and 
their carers that live at home (are not in residential care).

DOMAIN 2: STUDY DESIGN
9. What methodological orientation was stated to underpin the 
study?
An exploratory, qualitative study was conducted employing semi-struc-
tured interviews. Data were analysed using framework analysis.
10. How were participants selected?
Informal carers were eligible if:
• They had provided or still provide some sort of assistance with medica-
tion management to a person who has been diagnosed with dementia 
and is living in the community;
• Do not receive any sort of payment (excluding carers’ allowance).
Health and social professionals were eligible if:
• they had been in contact with or had been providing assistance to peo-
ple with dementia
11. How were participants approached?
Participants were recruited from the Alzheimer’s society, Dementia UK, 
local surgeries and other professional networks, and local dementia sup-
port groups (including a support group for people with dementia in the 
black and minority ethnic [BME] community in Yorkshire). The institutions 
were contacted by LA and IM via telephone and email and asked about 
their willingness to collaborate in advertising the study. Also, they were 
provided with information and details of the research, what taking part in 
this study would involve and the criteria individuals had to meet to be able 
to participate.
Recruitment was also conducted through snowball effect as contacts 
were requested to suggest other PwD, informal carers and HSCPs who 
might be willing to take part in this study. After their approval to collabo-
rate in advertising this study, the contact details of IM and LA were pro-
vided and potential participants were free to contact IM and LA via email 
or phone to express their interest in participating. An email was then sent 
to all potential participants, who expressed an interest in the study, with 
an information sheet with details of the study and a consent form followed 
by a request of their availability in case they agreed in taking part.
12. How many participants were in the study?
The final sample comprised of 31 participants [eleven informal carers; 
four PwD, sixteen Health or Social Care Professionals (HSCPs). From the 
sixteen HSCPs, four were general practitioners, five were nurses (practice 
and district nurses), three were paid carers and four were community 
pharmacists].
13. How many people refused to participate or dropped out?
None.
14. Where was the data collected?
The interviews with carers and people with dementia were conducted in 
the person’s home. The interviews with health and social care professionals 
were conducted either face-to-face in their place of work or over the phone.
COREC GUIDELINES
DOMAIN 1: RESEARCH TEAM AND REFLEXIVITY
1. Which author/s conducted the interview or the focus group?
The interviews were conducted by Lydia Aston, Tiago Moutela or Andrea Hilton. Ian Maidment provided supervision.
2. What were the researcher’s credentials?
IM and AH are both pharmacists experienced in dementia care. LA and TM are Health Psychologists in training with a Masters in Health Psychology 
(including a module in advanced qualitative methods).
3. What was their occupation at the time of the study?
LA and TM were RAs specifically employed on this project. IM was a Senior Lecturer in Clinical Pharmacy, Aston University. AH was a Senior Lecturer 
at Hull University and a practising Community Pharmacist.

IM and AH are pharmacists experienced in dementia care. LA and TM have conducted numerous qualitative research projects as part of their Masters 
and working as RA’s at Aston University.
6. Was a relationship established prior to study commencement?
LA and TM did not know any of the participants prior to study commencement. AH personally knew one of the pharmacists (given the geographical 
location), full informed consent was gained. They introduced the topic before the interview started and formally introduced themselves; this included ex-
plaining their current role in the project.
7. What did the participants know about the researcher?
The participants knew that IM of Aston University was leading the research and it was funded by Pharmacy Research UK and that LA and TM were 
research assistants and that AH was an academic from Hull University.

15. Was anyone else present besides the participants and 
researchers?
No-one else was present except for interviews pp 025, 026 and 027 
when a translator/interpreter from the same community was present. The 
interpreter did not hold an official qualification however they were from 
the same background and spoke the same language as the participants. 
The interpreters had been involved in previous studies where they have 
translated and were identified by an academic from the same community. 
He was confident of the accuracy of the translation and the results were 
consistent with other findings.
16. What are the important characteristics of the sample?
Informal carers were eligible if: they had provided or still provide 
some sort of assistance with medication management to a person 
who has been diagnosed with dementia and is living in the commu-
nity and did not receive any sort of payment (excluding carers 
allowance).
Health and social professionals were eligible if they had been in contact 
with or had been providing assistance to people with dementia.
17. Were questions, prompts, guides provided by the authors? Was it 
pilot tested?
The interview schedule consisted of open-ended questions to avoid 
leading participants’ responses. Prompts were included in the schedule 
and were employed if required. LA and IM with support from AH devel-
oped the interview schedule. No pilot test took place.
18. Were repeat interviews carried out?
No interviews were repeated.
19. Did the research use audio or visual recording to collect the data?
A Dictaphone was used to record the interviews. Data were transcribed 
verbatim.
20. Were field notes made during and/or after the interview or focus 
group?
Additional notes were made during the interviews.
21. What was the duration of the interviews or focus group?
The length of each interview was not formally recorded. However, on 
discussion with LA, TM and AH, the interviews with HSCPs lasted on aver-
age approximately 20 to 30 minutes; the interviews with carers/PwD 60 
to 90 minutes.
22. Was data saturation discussed?
Data saturation was reached and discussed amongst all co-authors.
23. Were transcripts returned to participants for comment and/or 
correction?
Transcripts were not returned to the participants, but potential themes 
were discussed between all co-authors.
DOMAIN 3: ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS
24. How many data coders coded the data?
TM and IM independently reviewed the transcripts. Disagreements on 
the interpretation and analysis of the data were then discussed between 
TM and IM until consensus was achieved. A systematic cross-comparison 
analysis was undertaken by TM, and reviewed by IM to identify the simi-
larities and differences between the different participants and to develop 
a set of themes which represent the whole corpus of data. TM and IM then 
discussed and agreed the final structure of the matrix for the analysis.
25. Did authors provide a description of the coding tree?
No.
26. Were themes identified in advance or derived from the data?
Themes were derived from the data. Three key concepts were elicited 
from the data with subthemes within these three themes.
27. What software, if applicable, was used to manage the data?
NVIVO software was used to manage the data.
28. Did participants provide feedback on the findings?
Participants did not provide feedback.
29. Were participant quotations presented to illustrate the themes/
findings? Was each quotation identified?
Extracts presented in the results section were drawn directly from the 
transcripts, which are recordings of the interviews.
30. Was there consistency between the data presented and the 
findings?
Yes there was consistency between the data presented and the findings.
31. Were major themes clearly presented in the findings?
Three key concepts were elicited from the data with subthemes within 
these three themes, and all three themes were discussed in the results 
section.
32. Is there a description of diverse cases or discussion of minor 
themes?
Yes, diverse cases have been discussed and the differences between the 
interview data from the carers and HSCPs. When relevant, minor themes 
were discussed.
