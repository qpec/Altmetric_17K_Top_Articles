Abstract
Background: Policies restricting children’s exposure to unhealthy food marketing have been impeded by the lack
of evidence showing a direct link between food advertising exposure and children’s energy intake and body weight.
Food advertising exposure increases children’s immediate food consumption, but whether this increased intake is
compensated for at later eating occasions is not known; consequently the sustained effect on diets remains unclear.
Methods: We conducted a within-subject, randomised, crossover, counterbalanced study across four, six-day holiday
camps in New South Wales, Australia between April 2016 and January 2017. Children (7–12 years, n = 160) were recruited
via local schools, email networks and social media. Two gender- and age-balanced groups were formed for each camp
(n = 20), randomised to either a multiple- or single- media condition and exposed to food and non-food advertising in an
online game and/or a television cartoon. Children’s food consumption (kilojoules) was measured at a snack immediately
after exposure and then at lunch later in the day. Linear mixed models were conducted to examine relationships
between food advertising exposure and dietary intake, taking into account gender, age and weight status.
Results: All children in the multiple-media condition ate more at a snack after exposure to food advertising compared
with non-food advertising; this was not compensated for at lunch, leading to additional daily food intake of 194 kJ
(95% CI 80–308, p = 0.001, d = 0.2). Exposure to multiple-media food advertising compared with a single-media source
increased the effect on snack intake by a difference of 182 kJ (95% CI 46–317, p = 0.009, d = 0.4). Food advertising had
an increased effect among children with heavier weight status in both media groups.
Conclusion: Online (‘advergame’) advertising combined with TV advertising exerted a stronger influence on children’s
food consumption than TV advertising alone. The lack of compensation at lunch for children’s increased snack intake
after food advertising exposure suggests that unhealthy food advertising exposure contributes to a positive energy-gap,
which could cumulatively lead to the development of overweight.

 Background
Overweight is, arguably, the natural response to our food
environment [1] which is dominated by low-cost, ultra-
processed, energy-dense, highly palatable food products
[2]. Food marketing most commonly promotes these
high fat, high salt and high sugar foods [3]. Worldwide,
television is still the main platform for food advertising
[3, 4], however, the proliferation of digital technologies,
including the Internet and mobile devices, has seen an
increasing prevalence of food advertising on ‘new media’
[5]. In recent years, advergames have been introduced as
an online marketing tool, where the brand and/or prod-
uct is a prominent feature [6]. This high prevalence of
unhealthy food promotion propagates societal norms where
advertised high energy and low nutrient dense foods are
acceptable and desirable [6]. Advertisements also serve as
conditioned stimuli, which stimulate food cravings and cue
consumption [7].
Restricting children’s food marketing exposure has been
identified as an international policy priority for the pre-
vention of childhood overweight and obesity [8, 9]. How-
ever, few countries have enforced statutory regulations
and, globally, major regulatory reform essentially remains
un-implemented, with most countries relying on industry-
led pledges for responsible advertising [10]. Research evi-
dence indicates that these industry pledges have not been
effective in reducing children’s exposures to unhealthy
food marketing [10, 11]. As such, children continue to be
exposed to high levels of unhealthy food marketing across
a wide variety of media and settings [11], to promotions
they find highly appealing and engaging [3]. A growing
body of evidence indicates that food marketing affects
children’s food attitudes, preferences and consumption
[3, 12], most likely through a logical, cumulative sequence
of cognitive and behavioural responses [13]. A key issue
impeding policy change, however, is the shortage of evi-
dence showing a direct link between food marketing and
children’s energy intake and the sustained effect of expo-
sures on children’s body weight [14]. Brief exposure to
food advertising on TV or Internet advergames has an
immediate direct effect on children’s food consumption,
significantly increasing their intake of snack foods [15],
but whether or not this increased energy intake is com-
pensated for at later eating occasions is not known. Many
of these single exposure experimental studies have been
conducted in laboratory settings and have not accounted
for the cumulative effects of media exposures or the im-
pact of repeated exposures across multiple media.
Economic modelling suggests that limiting food market-
ing to children would be one of the most cost-effective
population-based strategies to reduce the prevalence of
childhood obesity, resulting in both children’s health gains
and health-service savings [16]. Data that were used to
calculate these cost-benefits are now over three decades
old, being derived from the only longer-term experimental
study in this field, conducted at a children’s holiday camp
in Canada in 1982 [17]. The advertising landscape of 2018
is vastly different [5] and up-to-date data is needed for
contemporary economic modelling studies. Conducting
longer-term experimental studies in this field, however, is
methodologically challenging and resource intensive and,
as such, research of this nature is limited [13].
This study aimed to document children’s dietary intake
over a period of six days during their time at a holiday
camp, following exposure to food and non-food advertis-
ing from online (advergames) and/or TV media platforms.
There were three main objectives for this study. First, we
tested the hypothesis that children would eat more at a
snack after food advertising exposure compared with non-
food advertising. Secondly, we hypothesised that exposure
to food advertising across multiple media would have an
increased effect on children’s immediate snack intake
compared with those only exposed to food advertising
from a single media source. Thirdly, this study mea-
sured if any increased energy consumed as a result of
exposure to food advertising was compensated for by
children consuming less energy at the later lunchtime
eating occasion, and hence identified whether food ad-
vertising exposure resulted in a positive energy balance
during their time at camp.
Methods
Study design, participants and materials
The study took place across four, six-day school holiday
camps, from 8 am to 1.30 pm each day, between April
2016 and January 2017, at a single location in New
South Wales (NSW), Australia. We partnered with the
University of Wollongong Children’s Sports Holiday
Camp and the Early Start research centre. Early Start is
a child-focused research facility incorporating a large
commercial kitchen, dining area and community engage-
ment rooms. Both the camp and research centre are
located on the same campus, within five minutes’ walk
of each other.
Participant recruitment took place in the month pre-
ceding each holiday camp period, in March, June, July
and December 2016. A total of 160 children, (78 female,
82 male), aged 7–12 years (9.3 ± 1.6 (mean ± SD), were
recruited into the camp (n = 40/camp) via local schools,
community and university networks and social media.
Children were deemed eligible if they were able to attend
the camp on all days; did not report having any food aller-
gies or intolerances or medical conditions affecting what
they could eat; had no dietary restrictions or dislike of the
study foods; and were able to sit still and focus on a task
for at least 15 min. Incentives for participants included
payment for their holiday camp fees and the opportunity
to enter a draw to win an iPad at the end of each camp.

 Children were only permitted to participate once in the
study, attending only one of the holiday camps during the
data collection period. The study protocol was approved
by the University of Wollongong Human Research Ethics
Committee and can be accessed at http://www.ANZCTR.

Informed
written
consent from parents was obtained for all participants.
The study was a within-subject, randomised, crossover,
counterbalanced trial with two media condition arms:
multiple media (TV plus advergame) or single media (TV
only) (Fig. 1). Each media arm had two conditions: control
(an advergame featuring a non-food brand and/or exposure
to ten non-food TV advertisements) and experimental (an
advergame featuring an unhealthy food brand and/or ex-
posure to ten unhealthy TV food advertisements). Food
products in the experimental condition were classed as
high in fat, salt and/or sugar in accordance with the nutri-
ent profiling criteria developed by Food Standards Australia
New Zealand [18]. Non-food advertisements were selected
on the basis that they used persuasive techniques such as
fun, action and promotional characters; themes that are
commonly used in food advertisements to appeal to
children [19]. (A list of the advertised products that
were used is detailed in Table 1.) The TV advertisements
(approximately 30 s each) were embedded within a ten
minute age-appropriate, gender-neutral cartoon and shown
each day. There were no references to, or depictions of,
foods or eating in any of the cartoons screened. In order to
isolate the effects of the study advertising exposure, the
branded products selected for the experimental condition
were real products available in other countries but not
available for sale in Australian supermarkets or advertised
on commercial TV within Australia. Two groups of 20
children were formed for each camp, with an approxi-
mate even spread of gender and age between groups. A
simple, manual randomisation method was used, with
the first group drawn out of a hat allocated to the single
media intervention. This was conducted by an independent
researcher not associated with the study. Children under-
took both advertising conditions in each intervention arm,
with the order of advertising condition counterbalanced
across holiday camps. The study protocol, including menu
items, was finalised following a pilot study with 30 children
in January 2016.
An online brand recognition tool was designed to as-
sess children’s recollection of the advertised food brands,

 both pre and post study. Children were asked: a) if they
recognised 20 different photographs of both food and
non-food logos, and b) to describe the product to which
the logo related. This tool was based on a validated food
brand recognition instrument [20].
Children’s height and weight were measured on Day 1
of the study. Children’s body mass index (BMI) was calcu-
lated and these values were used to classify children into
underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese categor-
ies using international standardised cut-points [21].
Children reported how hungry they felt prior to morn-
ing tea and lunch each day using a validated picture-rating
scale; with the anchors “I am really hungry” and “I am not
hungry at all” [22].
Procedure
Each morning, children arrived fasting at the research
centre at 8 am, where they were served breakfast. The
dining space was set up with 40 individual trays and,
each day, children were offered a selection of portioned
breakfast cereals, fruit, toast or pikelets, spreads and
water to drink. The children were told that they could
eat as much or as little as they liked, and were given
more of each food item as requested. All additional food
items were offered in pre-portioned amounts that were
the same size for all children. Children were allocated a
unique identifying number which was placed on their
meal tray at each eating occasion and used to track how
much each child ate daily. After 30 min, the children left
to participate in the nearby holiday camp activities. Camp
leaders ensured that the physical intensity of camp activ-
ities was similar each session and day of the sports camp.
Children’s breakfast intake was quantified by assessing
whether children had eaten all, more than half, half, less
than half or none of each food item. Visual estimation
methods have been demonstrated to be a valid and highly
reliable method for estimating children’s food and beverage
consumption of pre-portioned food items [23]. Kilojoules
(kJ) were estimated from the proportion of each standar-
dised food item consumed, and children’s mean breakfast
intakes for the three days of food and three days of non-
food advertising were estimated.
At mid-morning children were directed to their inter-
vention rooms in the research centre with each room
supervised by two research assistants. The rooms were
bright and colourful with a carpeted floor and a large,
wall mounted TV screen. Children in both intervention
rooms were asked to take a seat on the floor and to
report how hungry they felt by filling out the picture
rating scale [22]. Children were then told that they
would be watching a cartoon and some advertisements.
Once the cartoon had finished, iPads were distributed
to the children in the multiple media condition and,
after an explanation on how to play, they played an
advergame for 5 min. In both rooms, after media exposure
was complete, individual trays with six small bowls of
snack foods were given out. Bowls contained 50 g of each
of the following foods: high fat savoury (crinkle-cut crisps,
plain potato crisps or chicken-flavoured crackers); low fat
savoury (pretzels, plain crackers or rice crackers); high
fat sweet (milk chocolate, chocolate-covered biscuits or
sugar-coated chocolate confectionery); low fat sweet
(assorted jelly lollies); fruit (green and black grapes or
peeled mandarin segments); and vegetable (carrot sticks).
These selections were in line with previous study designs
[24]. Snack items offered on Day One were matched with
those offered on Day Four, Day Two with Day Five and
Day Three with Day Six. None of the brands offered to
children to eat were featured in any of the advertisements.
Children were asked to wait until everyone had their trays
before they could start eating. They were, again, told that
they could eat as little or as much as they liked, and if they
would like some more they should put their hand up and
they would be given more of the requested food. This was
the only time either food or eating was referred to by the
research assistants. All additional foods were pre-weighed
in advance of the morning tea period. Advertisements
were not discussed with the children. Eating time was lim-
ited to 15 min after which children were instructed to
leave the room. Afterwards children left to take part in
further holiday camp activities and the remaining food on
each child’s tray was weighed and recorded.
Lunch was served at 13.00 each day back in the re-
search centre. Once again 40 individual trays were set
up with pre-weighed food items. There was a different
menu for Days One to Three which was repeated on
Days Four to Six. Lunch items included fruit, vegetables,
yoghurt and healthier versions of fast food, e.g. low fat

 beef burger; oven baked chicken pieces and chips. Each
day prior to lunch, children completed the picture rating
scale to report how hungry they felt [22]. As with the
previous meal occasions, children were told that they
could eat as little or as much as they liked and if they
would like some more to ask and they would be given
more of the requested food. Again, all additional food
items were pre-weighed prior to the lunchtime period.
Parents arrived to pick children up at 13.30. Once children
had left, all remaining individual food items were weighed
and recorded. We did not collect dietary data from
children once they left camp for the day.
Children’s morning snack and lunch intakes were con-
verted from gram amounts to kJ using FoodWorks 8
nutrient analysis software.
Children completed the online brand recognition ques-
tionnaires at home prior to the study commencing and in
the week following the study’s completion and a brand
recognition score was calculated. Parents reported their
household weekly income via an online questionnaire at
the end of the study.
Outcomes
There were two primary outcomes: firstly whether there
was an increase in snack intake (kJ) after food advertising
exposure compared with non-food advertising exposure
and secondly, if any increased intake was compensated
for at the lunchtime meal. The secondary outcome was
whether there was an increased effect on energy intake
(kJ) from exposure to food advertising over multiple
media compared with a single media source.
Statistical analysis
The sample size, with sufficient statistical power (80%)
to assess the first primary outcome, with a significance
of 0.05, was estimated from published data from a simi-
lar, short-term advertising exposure feeding trial in the
UK using the differences in kJ reported between condi-
tions [25].
Each child’s mean snack and lunch intakes for the
three days of food advertising exposure and three days
of non-food advertising exposure were calculated. All in-
take data met normality assumptions. Analysis of the
primary and secondary outcomes was conducted using
linear mixed models, adjusting for the clustered nature
of the data (i.e. camp identifier was included as a ran-
dom intercept in the models). The linear mixed models
were used to examine the differences in snack intake
(kJ) between the two media groups and the differences
in the snack and lunch intakes (kJ) between advertising
conditions within each group. Any influence of the impact
of age (months), gender, weight status (BMI z-score), chil-
dren’s baseline brand recognition score, household weekly
income or hunger on snack intake was investigated by
adding these variables as covariates to the model. All ana-
lyses used a significance level of 0.05. All analyses were
completed using the Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences statistical software package, version 23 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Of the 160 children enrolled in the study, six did not
complete all six days of the camp, so their data were not
included in the final analysis (Fig. 1). Table 2 depicts the
completing participants’ characteristics across the two
media condition groups. The proportion of children with
overweight or obesity in our study (16%) was lower than
the NSW state average (23%) [26]. The median house-
hold income of all families in the study was between
$2000–2499 per week which was substantially higher
than the NSW median household income of $800–999
per week [27].
As a whole group (n = 154), children’s estimated mean
kJ intake at breakfast on the food advertising days (1350 ±
500 kJ) was similar to intakes on non-food advertising
days (1300 ± 500 kJ) (p = 0.079).
A significant main effect for media condition was found.
Children in the TV plus advergame group (n = 78) ate
more at the snack after food advertising compared with
non-food advertising than the TV only group (n = 76)
(additional 182 kJ (95% CI 46 to 317)) (p = 0.009, d = 0.4)
(Table 3). Consequently, data were analysed separately by
media condition. Age, gender, brand recognition score at
baseline and household weekly income had no significant
main effect or interaction and were removed from further
analyses.
Children’s reported hunger prior to advertising exposure
was related to their snack intake in both the food advertis-
ing and non-food advertising conditions (p = 0.000). The
difference in snack intake between food and non-food ad-
vertising exposures, however, remained significant after
controlling for the difference in hunger between the adver-
tising conditions (p = 0.008). In the TV only condition, BMI
z-score was related to children’s snack intake after food ad-
vertising (p = 0.003) and non-food advertising (p = 0.038).
In the TV plus advergame group (n = 78), mean kJ in-
take was 201 kJ higher at the snack after food advertising
exposure (2168 ± 787 kJ) compared with non-food adver-
tising (1968 ± 698 kJ) (p < 0.0001, d = 0.3). This difference
remained significant after controlling for hunger (p < 0.
0001). Within this media group, children with overweight
or obesity (n = 14) ate an additional 305 kJ (95% CI 73 to
538) more after food advertising exposure (p = 0.014, d =
0.3) compared with children with under−/normal weight
(n = 64) who ate 178 kJ (95% CI 82 to 274) more (p < 0.
0001, d = 0.3). In the TV only group, children with under
−/normal weight (n = 65) ate comparable amounts after
both food (1933 ± 619 kJ) and non-food (1929 ± 678 kJ)

 advertising exposures (p = 0.947). Likewise, within this
group, children with overweight or obesity (n = 11)
also ate similar amounts in both the food (2220 ±
711 kJ) and non-food advertising (2107 ± 621 kJ) con-
ditions (p = 0.576).
Children in the TV plus advergame group did not
compensate for their increased snack intake after food
advertising at their lunchtime meal. Children in this
group consumed an additional 194 kJ (95% CI 80 to
308) daily at camp (snack + lunch) (p = 0.001) after food
advertising exposure compared with non-food advertis-
ing exposure (Fig. 2, Table 3). The effect of the food
advertising appeared to be greater among children with
heavier weight status. Children with overweight and
obesity in the TV plus advergame group consumed an
extra 398 kJ (95% CI 168 to 627) daily at camp (p = 0.002)
compared with children with under−/normal weight who
consumed an extra 150 kJ (95% CI 21 to 279) daily (p = 0.
024) (Fig. 2). In the TV only group, children with over-
weight or obesity ate an extra 441 kJ (95% CI 135 to 747)
at lunch on food advertising days (p = 0.009); this led to an
additional 553 kJ (95% CI –23 to 1129) being consumed
on food advertising days at camp compared with non-
food advertising days (p = 0.058).

 Discussion
Principal findings of the study
Exposure to food advertising on TV and the advergame
led to significant increases in children’s daily energy intake
during their time at camp (194 kJ). This response was mag-
nified among children with overweight and obesity (n = 14);
consuming over double the additional daily kJ at the camp
(398 kJ) than children with under−/normal weight (n = 64,
150 kJ). This exaggerated response was also seen among
children of a heavier weight status in the TV only group,
with children (n = 11) consuming an extra 553 kJ (p = 0.
058) at the camp on the food advertising days. Given that
cohort studies suggest that a positive energy-gap of only
200–300 kJ a day may be all that is required for the devel-
opment of overweight in children [28, 29], these data raise
legitimate concerns about the direct influence that food ad-
vertising over long-term exposures may exert on children’s
weight.
Interpretation
Whilst not consistently seen across previous studies,
children with a heavier weight status have been often
shown to have heightened food intake responses to food
advertising on TV [24, 30] and branded food packages
[31]. In a UK study, children with overweight (n = 15) in-
creased their intake by 1280 kJ after TV food advertising
compared with control, and children with obesity (n = 11)
by 1970 kJ (p < 0.001), indicating they were highly influ-
enced by external food cues [24]. Indeed, children with
overweight or obesity, when tested with a ‘stop signal’ task,
have been shown to have less inhibitory control in re-
sponse to food stimuli than children with normal weight
[32]. The pre-frontal cortex is an area of the brain in-
volved in cognitive control, including impulse inhibition,
and making decisions in response to stimuli in the envir-
onment [33]. Neural imaging studies indicate a lack of
activation of this region in children in response to food
cues, in contrast to adults where activation is apparent
[33]. In response to fast food logos, children with obesity
have been shown to have lower activation in the pre-
frontal cortex compared with children with normal weight
[34]. These data suggest that a lack of impulsivity inhib-
ition in children, in response to food cues, could make
them less able to control eating impulses and, thus, more
susceptible to tempting food stimuli such as those found
in food marketing. Additionally, it would also appear that
children with a heavier weight status have a particular vul-
nerability to branding and food advertising effects.
Children within the TV plus advergame group ate signifi-
cantly more snack foods after food advertising (201 kJ)
compared with non-food advertising, whilst children in the
TV only group ate similar amounts at the snack after both
the food and non-food advertisements. There was an in-
creased effect seen among children with a heavier weight
status in both media groups but at different meal occasions.
In the TV plus advergame group children with overweight
or obesity (n = 14) increased their snack intake by a signifi-
cant 305 kJ after food advertising exposure. In the TV only
group (n = 11), although no increased effect was observed
at snack-time, children with overweight and obesity ate an

 additional 441 kJ at lunchtime on food advertising days
compared with non-food advertising days. The advertised
foods were not offered to the children, indicating these
effects were not brand or product specific but transferred
to the foods that were on offer. Significant effects also
remained after controlling for hunger. The lack of an adver-
game only group meant that we were unable to isolate
whether the significant main effect for media condition that
we observed was due to the double exposure of TV and the
advergame or to the nature of the game itself. The effects
of playing an advergame only on snack intake have been
previously demonstrated, with children (8–10 years) eating
more (286 kJ, p < 0.001) after playing a five minute game
promoting energy-dense foods (n = 69) compared with a
non-food game (n = 65); although this study did not differ-
entiate between children with different weight statuses [35].
Advergames are designed to be fun and engaging, with
brand immersion as the primary objective [36]. Given the
consumption responses of children within this group, it
would appear children have responded to the food cues
prominent within the games.
Our findings suggest insights into child obesity policy
at both upstream and mid-stream levels. From a primary
prevention perspective, our findings clearly highlight the
need for regulatory intervention to restrict children’s
exposure to unhealthy food promotions, on TV and across
different media platforms, and particularly online media.
The recent rules introduced by the UK’s media self-
regulatory body, the Committee of Advertising Practice,
restricting the advertising of foods high in fat, salt or sugar
in children’s non-broadcast media, are a step in the right
direction in this regard [37]. From a weight management
perspective, the increased vulnerability to food cues we
observed among children with a heavier weight status
supports the inclusion of interventions which aim to
diminish sensitivity to these stimuli in children’s weight
loss education programs [7, 38, 39]. Although in their
early infancy as an approach for children’s weight manage-
ment, Cue Exposure Treatment programs hold promise in
supporting children to resist the abundance of food cues
in today’s environment [7, 38, 39]. The basic premise of
these interventions is to present children with repeated,
non-reinforced exposures to highly palatable foods with
the aim of weakening the child’s conditioned response,
that is, the desire to eat [38, 39].
Strengths and limitations
A key strength of this study was that we created a natural
environment within which to collect the data, and in which
the children were comfortable and relaxed. The recreation
centre and the dining area would not be dissimilar to the
facilities that children would experience when attending
school camps during term time. That the children enjoyed
taking part in the study and camp is strongly supported by
the overwhelmingly positive feedback we received from the
parents in their follow-up questionnaire and the low study
attrition.
Some limitations in study design point to why signifi-
cant differences in snack intake between food and non-
food advertising conditions in the TV only group were not
seen. Unlike previous studies, which used TV food adver-
tisements aired within their study’s countries [24, 30, 40],
we elected to use unfamiliar brands. This was to isolate
the effect of advertising exposure, without influence from
pre-formed brand attitudes or associations. There is
strong evidence that repetitive exposure to advertising en-
hances evaluation of that stimuli [41, 42], with maximum
attitude and affect reached at approximately ten advertis-
ing exposures [43]. It is possible that exposure to novel
brands and, consequently lesser opportunity to form posi-
tive affect with that brand or product, may not have cued
children’s consumption responses to the extent that has
previously been observed where food brands were familiar
[24, 30, 40], thus resulting in a null effect. The increased
effect of prior advertising exposure on children’s food
intake exposure via advergames has previously been
demonstrated. In an earlier study from the USA, children
who had previous food branded game play experience
consumed 577 kJ more from unhealthy snack foods than
children who played healthy or non-food advergames in
the study [44].
The time of day we conducted our study could also
have influenced children’s consumption responses. Evi-
dence suggests that self-regulatory capacity lessens across
time as the cognitive resources needed to exert inhibition
and executive control become depleted over the course of
the day [45]. We measured children’s snack intake in the
morning, when children’s ability to self-regulate is, argu-
ably, at its height [45]. In contrast, previous studies, where
significant effects of TV food advertising on children’s
food intake were seen, and which reported time of day,
were conducted in the afternoon [17, 40].
A further limitation may have been that children were
given a 15 min snack eating time, which was not disclosed
to them. In two previous studies, where significant effects
on snack food intake were seen subsequent to TV food ad-
vertising exposure, children (n = 42–59, aged 9–11 years)
were given unlimited time to eat during the experimental
eating period [24, 30]. In our study, a number of children
had asked for more high fat sweet or low fat sweet items
and had not eaten all that they had requested. We surmise
that having asked for more of these food items that children
had the intention of eating them and, hence, would have
finished eating the sweets if they had had sufficient time.
Indeed, the most proximal determinant of actual behaviour
is the intention to carry out that behavior, according to the
Theory of Planned Behaviour [46]. Food enjoyment is in-
versely correlated with satiety responsiveness and positively
Norman et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  (2018) 15:37 
Page 8 of 11
 correlated with food responsiveness and desire to eat [47].
The portion size of the extra food items was only 25 g so
coupled with the low satiability of energy-dense, sweet and
high fat foods [48, 49], and with children’s predisposition
for these highly palatable foods [50], this is a reasonable
expectation. Analyses of mean snack food intakes allowing
for children to finish the extras that they had asked for,
suggests that food advertising would have had a significant
increased effect on children’s snack intake in the TV only
condition (data not shown).
Furthermore, we were under-represented in the propor-
tion of children with overweight or obesity in our study
compared with the state population [26] and, hence, it
would appear, under-powered to detect a mean difference
in snack intake among this subgroup of children in the TV
only group. A power calculation indicates that we would
have needed a sample of 60 children with overweight or
obesity to detect a mean difference of the magnitude that
we observed (113 kJ), with a significance level of 0.05.
In line with previous studies [51, 52], we asked children
to report how hungry they were feeling prior to the snack
period, in order to control for hunger in our analyses. As
such, we cannot rule out the potential of confirmation
bias, in which children may have been less likely to eat as
much if they had previously reported that they were not
very hungry [53]. We did, however, ask children about
their level of hunger prior to both the food and non-food
advertising exposures, so it is likely that any effects would
have been non-differential across conditions.
Children did not compensate for their increased snack
intake after food advertising during their days at the
camp, however it is possible that they may have eaten
less at mealtimes later in the day, or on subsequent days.
Whilst we assessed children’s breakfast intake and mea-
sured their daily snack and lunch intakes we did not cap-
ture children’s food intake once they left the camp for the
day. The limitations and challenges of collecting dietary in-
take data among free-living populations, particularly chil-
dren, are well documented; they pose a high respondent
burden, prompt an alteration of usual dietary habits and
there is a poor accuracy when reporting food eaten away
from home [54]. As such, we would not have been able to
maintain the precision of the dietary intake data we had
collected during camp hours if we had extended dietary
data collection outside this controlled environment. There
remain questions over whether children would have com-
pensated for their increased energy intake at later eating
occasions. As previously discussed, self-regulation tends to
lessen over the course of the day [45]. Additionally, al-
though research with young children (3 − 6 years) sug-
gests that they adjust their daily food intake according
to the energy density of their diets [55], studies with
older children indicate that this ability to accurately
compensate tends to decrease with age [56, 57], and is
weaker in children with heavier weight status [58]. Whilst
camp leaders ensured children’s camp activities were of a
similar intensity and duration each day, children may have
compensated for their additional energy intake after food
advertising via increased energy expenditure outside the
camp environment. In the absence of physical activity
accelerometry data we are unable to determine this.
Conclusion
Children’s exposure to unhealthy food marketing is dir-
ectly associated with an imbalance in energy intake which
was not compensated for during children’s time at camp.
Whilst this energy imbalance may have been compensated
for at a subsequent time, it is of a magnitude that, over
time, could drive a positive energy gap capable of under-
pinning excess weight gain in children. This energy gap is
higher for children with overweight and obesity, and after
exposure to TV food advertising and online advergames.
These findings should inform policy specifications, includ-
ing the need to focus regulatory restrictions across media
platforms, and particularly online media, and that behav-
ioural weight management interventions should address
heavier children’s vulnerability to food promotions.
