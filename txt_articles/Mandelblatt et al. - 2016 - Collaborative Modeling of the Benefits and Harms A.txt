Abstract
Background—Controversy persists about optimal mammography screening strategies.
Objective—To evaluate mammography strategies considering screening and treatment advances.
Design—Collaboration of six simulation models.
Data Sources—National data on incidence, risk, breast density, digital mammography 
performance, treatment effects, and other-cause mortality.
Target Population—An average-risk cohort.
Time Horizon—Lifetime.
Perspective—Societal.
Interventions—Mammograms from age 40, 45 or 50 to 74 at annual or biennial intervals, or 
annually from 40 or 45 to 49 then biennially to 74, assuming 100% screening and treatment 
adherence.
Outcome Measures—Screening benefits (vs. no screening) include percent breast cancer 
mortality reduction, deaths averted, and life-years gained. Harms include number of 
mammograms, false-positives, benign biopsies, and overdiagnosis.
Results for Average-Risk Women—Biennial strategies maintain 79.8%-81.3% (range across 
strategies and models: 68.3–98.9%) of annual screening benefits with almost half the false-
positives and fewer overdiagnoses. Screening biennially from ages 50–74 achieves a median

 25.8% (range: 24.1%-31.8%) breast cancer mortality reduction; annual screening from ages 40–74 
years reduces mortality an additional 12.0% (range: 5.7%-17.2%) vs. no screening, but yields 
1988 more false-positives and 7 more overdiagnoses per 1000 women screened. Annual screening 
from ages 50–74 had similar benefits as other strategies but more harms, so would not be 
recommended.
Sub-population Results—Annual screening starting at age 40 for women who have a two- to 
four-fold increase in risk has a similar balance of harms and benefits as biennial screening of 
average-risk women from 50–74.
Limitations—We do not consider other imaging technologies, polygenic risk, or non-adherence.
Conclusion—These results suggest that biennial screening is efficient for average-risk groups, 
but decisions on strategies depend on the weight given to the balance of harms and benefits.

Introduction
Despite decades of mammography screening for early breast cancer detection, there is no 
consensus on optimal strategies, target populations, or the magnitude of benefits and harms. 
(1–11) Based on data available at the time, the 2009 US Preventive Services Task Force 
(USPSTF) recommended biennial film mammography from ages 50–74, with suggestions 
for shared decision-making about whether to start screening in the 40’s.(12) Since then, 
there are some new data regarding screening benefits,(2,6,8,9,11,13) digital mammography 
has replaced plain film,(14) and increasingly effective breast cancer systemic treatment 
regimens targeting molecular sub-types are in widespread use.(15)
These advances have the potential to affect conclusions about optimal breast cancer 
screening programs.(16) There is also growing interest in personalizing screening based on 
breast density, risk factors, life expectancy, and patient preferences.(16–21) Modeling has 
the advantage of considering these factors and providing a quantitative summary of the net 
balance of harms and benefits that incorporate preferences (utilities), while holding selected 
conditions (e.g., treatment effects) constant, facilitating strategy comparisons.(22,23) 
Collaboration of several models provides a range of plausible effects and illustrates the 
impact of differences in model assumptions.(1,7,24)
We use six well-established simulation models to synthesize new data to examine outcomes 
of biennial or annual digital mammography screening starting at ages 40, 45, or 50 through 
age 74 among average-risk women. In secondary analyses we also examine how breast 
density, and risk- or comorbidity-level affects results, and whether utilities for health states 
related to screening and its downstream consequences affect conclusions. The results are 
intended to contribute to current practice and policy debates.
Methods
The models were developed independently within the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance 
Modeling Network (CISNET) (25–31) and were institutional review board approved. The 
models included model D (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts), model E

 (Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands), model GE (Georgetown University 
Medical Center, Washington, DC and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New 
York), model M (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas), model S (Stanford 
University, Stanford, California), and model W (University of Wisconsin, Madison, 
Wisconsin and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts).
Since our earlier analysis,(1) the models have undergone substantial revision to reflect 
advances in breast cancer control, including: portrayal of four distinct molecular subtypes 
based on estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor-2 receptor (HER2) 
status;(24) current population incidence (32) and competing non-breast cancer mortality; 
digital screening; and the most current therapies.(33) All models (except Model S) include 
DCIS. The general modeling approach is summarized below; full details are available at: 
https://resources.cisnet.cancer.gov/registry and (34).
The models begin with estimates of breast cancer incidence (32) and ER/HER2-specific 
survival trends without screening or adjuvant treatment and then overlay data on screening 
and molecular subtype-specific adjuvant treatment to generate observed US population 
incidence and mortality trends.(1,7,16,24,35) Breast cancers have a distribution of 
preclinical screen-detectable periods (sojourn time) and clinical detection points. Digital 
mammography performance characteristics are based on age, first vs. subsequent screen, 
time since last mammogram, and breast density. ER/HER2 status is assigned at diagnosis 
based on stage and age. Molecular sub-type- and stage-specific treatment reduces the 
hazards of breast cancer death (models D, GE, M, and S) or results in a cure for some cases 
(models E and W). Women can die of breast cancer or other causes.
Screen detection of cancer during the preclinical screen-detectable period can result in the 
identification (and treatment) of earlier-stage or smaller tumors than might occur via clinical 
detection, with a corresponding reduction in breast cancer mortality.
We used a cohort of women born in 1970 with average population risk and breast density 
and follow them from age 25 (since breast cancer is rare before this age [0.08% of cases]) 
until death.
Model Input Parameters
The models begin with a common set of age-specific variables for breast cancer incidence, 
digital mammography performance characteristics, ER/HER2-specific treatment effects, and 
average and comorbidity-level specific-non-breast cancer competing causes of death. (34) In 
addition, each group includes model-specific inputs (or intermediate outputs) to represent 
preclinical detectable times, lead-time, and age- and ER/HER2-specific stage distribution in 
screen- vs. non-screen-detected women on the basis of their specific model structure.
(1,7,24–31) These model-specific parameters are based on assumptions about combinations 
of values that reproduce US trends in incidence and mortality, including proportions of 
DCIS that are nonprogressive and would not be detected without screening. Models M and 
W also assume some small nonprogressive invasive cancers. The models adopt an age-
period-cohort modeling approach to project breast cancer incidence rates in the absence of

 screening;(32,36) Model M uses 1975–79 SEER rates. The models assume 100% adherence 
to screening and the most effective treatment to isolate the effect of screening strategies.
Four models use age-specific digital mammography sensitivity values observed in the Breast 
Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) for detection of invasive and DCIS cancers 
combined (model S only uses data for invasive cancers). Separate values are used for initial 
and subsequent mammography performed at annual or biennial intervals. An annual interval 
is defined as 9–18 months between examinations and biennial as 19–30 months.(37–39) 
Model D uses these data as input variables (29) and models GE, S, and W use the data for 
calibration.(25,26,28) Models E and M fit estimates from the BCSC and other data.(27,30)
All women with ER-positive tumors receive five years of hormonal therapy (tamoxifen if 
diagnosed <50 years and aromatase inhibitors if ≥50 years) and an anthracycline-based 
regimen accompanied by a taxane. Women with ER-negative invasive tumors receive 
anthracycline-based regimens with a taxane. Those with HER2-positive tumors receive 
trastuzumab. Women with ER–positive DCIS receive hormonal therapy.(15) Treatment 
effectiveness is based on clinical trials and is modeled as a reduction in mortality risk or 
increase in the proportion cured vs. ER/HER2-specific survival in the absence of therapy;
(33) estimates assume women receive local therapy.
Benefits
Screening benefits (vs. no screening or other screening strategies) are measured using 
percent breast cancer mortality reduction, breast cancer deaths averted, and life-years (LYs) 
and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained because of averted or delayed breast cancer 
death. Benefits (and harms) are accumulated from ages 40–100 years to capture the lifetime 
impact of screening strategies.
To quality-adjust life years, we applied a disutility for age- and gender-specific general 
population health.(40) These were further adjusted to account for additional disutilities 
related to undergoing screening (−0.006 for one week), having an evaluation of a positive 
screen (−0.105 for five weeks), initial treatment by stage (for the first 2 years after 
diagnosis), and distant disease (for the last year of life for all women who die of breast 
cancer).(34,41,42)
Harms
Harms included number of mammograms, false-positive mammograms, benign biopsies, 
and overdiagnosis. We defined the rate of false-positive mammograms as the number of 
mammograms read as abnormal or needing further work-up in women without cancer 
divided by the total number of screening mammograms. Benign biopsies were defined as a 
biopsy recommendation among women with false-positive screening results.(43) 
Overdiagnosis was defined as cases that would not have been clinically detected in the 
absence of screening (because of lack of progressive potential or death from competing 
mortality). The impact of overdiagnosis on QALYs is captured by the disutility for being in a 
cancer state but dying of other causes without a change in life expectancy.

 Analysis
We evaluated eight strategies that varied by starting age (40, 45, 50) and interval (annual, 
biennial, and hybrid [annual in the 40’s and biennial in the 50’s]); all strategies stop 
screening at age 74. We included “no screening” as baseline for the percent mortality 
reduction associated with any given strategy.
We ranked strategies by the number of mammograms performed (or harms) for each model. 
We report the median benefit and range across models. We also obtained an efficiency 
frontier by plotting the sequence of points that represent the largest incremental percent 
mortality reduction (or LYs or QALYs) per mammograms performed or harm entailed. 
Screening strategies that fall on this frontier are the most efficient (i.e., no alternative exists 
that provides more benefit with fewer resources/harms). The most intensive strategy is 
usually the top anchor point on the frontier.
Four models (model D, E, GE, and W) also evaluated how results vary when different 
subpopulations are screened. First, we investigated subpopulations based on their breast 
density: entirely fatty (“a”), scattered density (“b”), heterogeneously dense (“c”) and 
extremely dense (“d”). Based on observed age-specific prevalence rates, density was 
assigned at age 40, and could have remained the same or decreased by one level at age 50 
and again at age 65.(44) Density modified mammography sensitivity and specificity based 
on age, density, interval, and first vs. subsequent screening.(34) Density also modified risk 
of developing breast cancer for age groups 40–49, 50–64, and 65+, using the average 
population density in each age group as the referent category (BCSC unpublished data).
(45,46) Density did not affect molecular subtype or disease natural history. Density results 
were grouped into low (a and b) and high density (c and d) for results presentation.
Additionally, we evaluated results for subpopulations with higher than average risk: 1.3 
(e.g., nullparity or age at first live birth >30), (18,47) 2.0 (e.g., family history of one first 
degree relative), (18) or 4.0 times higher than average-risk (e.g., 2 or more first degree 
relatives).(18,46) Higher risk levels, such as seen with BRCA 1/2 mutations, were not 
considered since such women have specific screening guidelines. Finally, we examined the 
impact on results of combinations of density and risk level. We made the simplifying 
assumption that risk affected incidence, but not other aspects of disease.
In other subpopulation analyses, two models (model E and GE) examined the impact of 
comorbidity-specific vs. overall population competing mortality on upper ages of screening 
cessation based on comorbidity-specific life expectancy.(21,48,49) We compare results for 
continuing to screen biennially past age 74 among women with lower than average 
comorbidity or stopping earlier than 74 for those with moderate or high comorbidity. These 
analyses included women who survived and did not develop breast cancer up until the point 
where screening is to be extended or stopped.
Four models considered the impact of varying the values for disutilities in sensitivity 
analyses to identify if there was a strategy where high disutility would eliminate screening 
benefits. Finally, we evaluated the ability of the models to independently predict external 
trends and results (Appendix 1).

 Role of the Funding Source
We worked with US Preventive Services Task Force and Agency for Healthcare Research 
and Quality (AHRQ) to develop the research question, but they had no role in study conduct. 
NCI investigators (KC, EF) collaborated on the research in their role as scientific project 
officers.
Results
Benefits
The models produced consistent rankings of screening strategies (Table 1). Biennial 
screening from ages 50 to 74 yielded a median 25.8% reduction in breast cancer mortality 
compared to no screening (range: 24.1%-31.8). Annual screening led to slightly greater 
reductions in mortality than biennial strategies. Rankings were similar for LYs and QALYs. 
For all benefit metrics (Table 2), strategies that included initiation at age 45 yielded results 
intermediate between those beginning at 40 and 50.
Incremental benefits of starting screening at age 40 vs. 50 were slightly greater in terms of 
breast cancer deaths averted for annual and biennial screening (median 1.3 [range: 1.1–1.7] 
vs. 1.0 [0.8–1.7] per 1000 women screened, respectively). (Table 3) Biennial strategies 
maintained a median of 79.8%-81.3% of the mortality reduction of annual screening (range 
across strategies and models 68.3–98.9%) (Table 4).
Harms
All of the models projected more false-positive results, benign biopsies, and overdiagnosed 
cases under annual vs. biennial schedules and starting at age 40 vs. age 50 (Table 2). For 
instance, if biennial screening began at age 40 instead of age 50, for every 1000 women 
screened there would be a median of 1 more death averted, but 576 more false-positive 
results, 58 benign biopsies, and 2 added overdiagnosed cases.
Efficiency Frontiers
Biennial strategies starting at age 40, 45, and 50 would generally be considered efficient 
when examining the balance of screening benefits and harms (Figure 1 and Appendix Figure 
2). The hybrid strategies of annual screening starting at age 40 or 45, followed by biennial 
screening at age 50 were close to being efficient. Annual screening from ages 50 to 74 
yielded the same or fewer benefits than the next least intensive strategy in all or most models 
depending on the measure of benefits, but required more mammograms or had more harms 
(i.e., was dominated), so would not be considered efficient.
Subpopulation Analyses
The rankings of strategies did not change when screening was targeted to groups with 
increasing risk levels; annual screening from ages 50 to 74 remained dominated across all 
risk levels (not shown). However, the balance of harms and benefits differed by risk group, 
with women who had higher risk having lower rates of false positives and higher gains from 
screening than lower risk groups. Screening higher risk women also yielded a lower 
proportion of overdiagnosed cases per death averted than screening women of average-risk.

 For women with a two- to four-fold increase in risk, annual screening starting at age 40 or 
45 had a similar or more favorable harm to benefit ratio (based on false positives) as biennial 
screening average-risk women from 50–74. For instance, for every 1000 average-risk 
women screened biennially from 50–74, there would be 226.5 (range: 169.9–267.0) false 
positives per death averted. If women with a two-fold increase in risk begin annual screening 
at age 40, their corresponding ratio would be slightly more favorable at 200.7 (range: 177.5–
232.2). For women with a 1.3 fold increase in risk, biennial screening starting at age 40 
would have similar harm to benefit ratios as biennial screening of average-risk women from 
ages 50–74.
Considering breast density group (low vs. high) changed absolute benefits, but did not affect 
ranking of the strategies, and for all metrics, annual screening from 50–74 remained 
dominated for all breast density groups. Women in the low density group had a greater 
proportion of their cancers detected and therefore greater mortality reduction than those in 
the high density group. However, women in the high density group had a greater absolute 
number of cancers because the incidence of cancer was higher in these women, therefore 
more life years were saved among women in the high density group (not shown).
For women with no comorbidity, biennial screening could continue to age 78 or 80 and still 
have similar harm to benefit ratios as screening women of average comorbidity biennially 
from 50–74. However, for women with moderate to severe comorbidity, the comparable 
ratios were equivalent at about age 68 (not shown).
Sensitivity Analyses
Consideration of utilities for usual health, screening, diagnosis, and treatment decreases 
estimates of QALYs but does not affect ranking of strategies (Table 1). The largest 
decrement related to quality adjustment accrues because of declines in health as women age. 
There are also substantial decrements in QALYs attributed to the disutility of undergoing 
diagnostic evaluation of an abnormal screening exam and for having cancer. The disutility 
associated with undergoing screening itself has a minimal impact on QALYs. Overall, there 
are persistent QALY gains under all screening strategies, but the magnitude becomes smaller 
when the highest disutility estimates are used. (34)
Discussion
This study used six established models with differing approaches and assumptions to 
estimate the potential efficacy of various US screening strategies based on risk, breast 
density, and comorbidity. All six modeling groups project some benefits associated with 
screening average-risk women from 40 to 49. The models consistently rank strategies and 
conclude that biennial screening strategies are most frequently efficient. Screening initiation 
at age 40 for average-risk women has the greatest benefit, but also the greatest harms. While 
absolute benefits vary, the ranking of strategies was not affected by risk level or breast 
density. Annual screening of women with a two to four-fold increased risk from ages 40–74 
had comparable harms to benefits ratios as biennial screening from age 50 to 74 in average-
risk populations. Consideration of quality of life reduced, but did not eliminate the

 magnitude of benefits from all strategies. Among women with severe or moderate levels of 
comorbidity, harms of screening outweighed benefits before age 74.
The results of this collaborative modeling research indicate that digital mammography 
screening of populations of average-risk women in their 40’s modestly lowers mortality and 
extends the length of life. This conclusion was seen in all models, although the absolute 
benefit varied based on model structure and assumptions.
Similar to our 2009 analysis,(1) biennial strategies are most consistently on the efficiency 
frontier. Screening annually from ages 50–74 had fewer benefits for any given harm (or 
resource use) under virtually all circumstances. However, annually screening in the 40’s 
followed by biennial screening at age 50, or the most intensive schedule evaluated (annual 
screening 40–74) were also on the efficiency frontier, and might be considered depending on 
preferences for thresholds of harms relative to benefits. While we only evaluated two 
starting ages in the 40’s, we found that screening benefits and harms for younger women 
seem to exist on a continuum.
This analysis extends our prior work by explicitly considering overdiagnosis. Depending on 
screening strategy, the models estimated that from 2% to 12% of invasive and 30% to 50% 
of DCIS cases may represent overdiagnoses. While the models differed in absolute 
estimates, they agreed on how overdiagnosis affects the ranking of strategies and that the 
majority of overdiagnosed cases were DCIS. The model results for overdiagnosis are not 
directly comparable to other published estimates (8,50) since the models followed women 
for their entire lives and considered competing mortality; the models also made assumptions 
about input parameters. While there is no agreement on methods to estimate (51) or the true 
rate of overdiagnosis,(52,53) there is agreement that it can lead to harm. Active surveillance 
for low-risk DCIS is one potential future approach to reduce harms from overdiagnosis of 
DCIS. More information is also needed on consumer knowledge of and willingness to risk 
overdiagnosis.(54)
The balance of harms to benefits became more favorable as underlying risk levels increased, 
but our results did not suggest that screening strategies necessarily need to be tailored by 
breast density, at least when grouped into low/high categories. Our results may differ from 
past studies of screening based on breast density,(20,55) since we modeled established 
digital mammography. While optimized for density, digital sensitivity is still lower in 
women with dense than non-dense breasts.(56–58) Improving outcomes for women with 
dense breasts may require dual consideration of risk and density,(58) and/or use of 
technology that employs alternative approaches to tissue visualization, such as 
tomosynthesis (59,60) or breast-specific gamma imaging,(61,62) or identification of genetic 
risk markers.(63–65)
Consistent with other analyses of screening upper age limits,(21,66–68) and other 
recommendations,(12,69) our results suggested that the balance of harms and benefits of 
screening was affected by competing mortality, so that age of screening cessation should be 
tailored by comorbidity levels.

 Overall, this study has several important strengths including collaboration of six independent 
modeling groups, consideration of digital technology, incorporation of increasingly effective 
treatments, and consideration of risk factors, breast density, and comorbidity levels. (70) The 
conclusions about the ranking of screening strategies are robust and should provide greater 
credibility than inferences based on one model alone. Despite this, there are several caveats 
that should be considered in evaluating our results. First, we assumed 100% adherence to 
screening, prompt evaluation of abnormal results, and full use of optimal treatment to 
evaluate program efficacy. Benefits will always fall short of the projected results since 
adherence is not perfect. If actual adherence varies systematically by age, risk, or other 
factors, it is also possible that the ranking of strategies could change. Second, we did not 
consider other imaging technologies, such as computer-aided detection,(71) tomosynthesis, 
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Performance data for general populations are still 
emerging,(60) so this will be important to consider once additional data are available. Next, 
we assumed that risk factors influenced incidence but did not affect disease natural history. 
Since certain risk factors are associated with higher false-positive rates than average,(38) the 
use of non-risk adjusted test specificity could have under-estimated false-positive rates. 
Also, we acknowledge that certain risk factors, such as family history, are age-dependent in 
their effects.(18,72) Since we held relative risk levels constant over age, our benefit 
estimates could be over- or under-estimated for specific risk factors.(16) We did not consider 
polygenic risk; this is an important emerging area for future research.(73,74) Last, compared 
to our earlier research,(1) the models all estimated similar, but somewhat greater mortality 
reductions from screening (e.g., 22% vs. 25.8% median mortality reduction with biennial 
screening from 50–74 in 2009 vs. current models, respectively). The primary reasons for this 
modeled improvement relate to the increased sensitivity of digital vs. film mammography, 
advances in molecular sub-type directed-adjuvant therapy, and changes in underlying breast 
cancer trends.
Overall, the evaluation of screening strategies by the six models suggests that optimal 
program design for average-risk women would continue to be based on biennial intervals. 
Choices about optimal ages of initiation and cessation will ultimately depend on program 
goals, weight attached to the balance of harms and benefits,(75) and considerations of 
efficiency.

 Figure 1. Efficiency Frontier for Harms (Average Number of Screening Examinations) and 
Benefits (Life Years Gained) for Exemplar Model by Screening Strategy
The panel shows an efficiency frontier graph for an exemplar model (model D); comparable 
graphs are included on Appendix Figure 2 for all 6 models.
The graph plots the average number of mammograms per 1,000 women against the life-
years gained for each screening strategy (vs. no screening). We plot efficient strategies (i.e., 
those in which increases in mammography use results in greater life-years gained than the 
next least-intensive strategy). The line between strategies represents the “efficiency frontier.” 
Strategies on this line would be considered efficient because they achieve the greatest gain 
per mammography used compared with the point (or strategy) immediately below it. Points 
that fall below the line are not as efficient as those on the line. When the slope in the 
efficiency frontier plot levels off, the additional life-years gained per increase in 
mammography are small relative to the previous strategies and could indicate a point at 
which additional screening might be considered as having a low return (benefit).
Black strategies are efficient; dark grey strategies are close to the efficiency frontier; and 
light grey strategies are dominated (inefficient). Biennial strategies are indicated with a 
square; hybrid strategies (annual in the 40’s, followed by biennial from 50–74) are 
represented by a triangle, and annual strategies with a circle. Efficiency frontiers for other 
harm and benefit metrics can be found at: (34)

1Without screening, the median probability of dying of breast cancer is 2.50% (range 1.50–3.20%). Thus, if a particular screening strategy leads to a 30% reduction in breast cancer mortality, this means 
that the probability of breast cancer mortality was reduced from 2.50% to 1.75%. This translates into 7.5 deaths averted per 1000 women screened.
A=Annual B=Biennial H=Hybrid
*Strategies are ranked from the least to the most number of mammograms Average number of mammograms across models. Not all possible mammograms in the age interval are obtained since some 
women die from other causes before screening would occur.
†Model Group Abbreviations: D (Dana Farber Cancer Center), E (Erasmus Medical Center), G-E (Georgetown U. –Einstein U.), M (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center), S (Stanford U.), W (University of 
Wisconsin/Harvard)
‡Grey shaded areas in the table show strategies that are dominated (“inefficient”) within a specific model; a strategy is classified as dominated if there is another strategy that results in an equal or higher 
percent mortality decline/LYG/QALYs with fewer average screening exams.
§QALYs are adjusted for general health, diagnosis, screening and treatment.
║100% of women receive adjuvant systemic therapy based on recommended stage, ER/HER2-specific adjuvant therapy for pre- and post-menopausal women.

*In all scenarios, 100% of women receive adjuvant systemic therapy based on recommended stage, ER/HER2-specific adjuvant therapy for pre- and post-menopausal women.
†Over-diagnosed cases are defined as cases that would not have been clinically detected in the absence of screening. The figure includes DCIS and invasive overdiagnosis. Overdiagnosis is calculated by 
comparing cases detected in the screening scenario to those detected in the unscreened scenario. Model S is excluded since it does not include DCIS. The percent overdiagnosis is calculated as the percent of 
all cases detected in the screening strategy that are overdiagnosis.
‡The upper range for all over diagnosis estimates is based on Model M results. Model M generates very high overdiagnosis based on the assumption that incidence in the absence of screening has essentially 
remained flat since 1975–79, with virtually all of the increases over time attributable to screening. The other models use some form of an age-period-cohort model for incidence in the absence of screening, 
where some of the increases in incidence are due to screening and some to changes in risk factors (e.g., use of hormone replacement therapy), generating lower rates of overdiagnosis. Other sources of 
variation across models are related to assumptions about the proportions of DCIS cases that never progress to invasive cancer or the number of early invasive cancers that might be nonprogressive. 
Generally, models that assume higher proportions of DCIS and/or invasive cancer to be nonprogressive generate higher estimates of overdiagnosis than models that assume less nonprogressive disease. 
Unfortunately, the underlying incidence in the absence of screening and the proportion and types of tumors that are nonprogressive are unknown and unobservable. Therefore, the different results across 
models based on their respective assumptions provide a range of possible overdiagnosis.

*Incremental difference between starting at age 40 or 45 vs. 50. Annual is comparing A40–74 (or 45–74) to A50–74; biennial is comparing B40–74 (or 45–74) to B50–74. Hybrid strategies are compared to 
biennial 50–74, therefore for these incremental comparisons the hybrid results are the same as the annual results.

§Model M does not include a natural history component. Based on a combination of assumptions regarding underlying incidence trends in the absence of screening, it essentially yields a long invasive 
cancer lead time; thus all cancers found with annual screening can also be detected with biennial screening.
