Abstract
Background
A previous analysis of the impact of drought in Africa on HIV demonstrated an 11% greater
prevalence in HIV-endemic rural areas attributable to local rainfall shocks. The Lesotho
Population-Based HIV Impact Assessment (LePHIA) was conducted after the severe
drought of 2014–2016, allowing for reevaluation of this relationship in a setting of expanded
antiretroviral coverage.
Methods and findings
LePHIA selected a nationally representative sample between November 2016 and May
2017. All adults aged 15–59 years in randomly selected households were invited to com-
plete an interview and HIV testing, with one woman per household eligible to answer ques-
tions on their experience of sexual violence. Deviations in rainfall for May 2014–June 2016
were estimated using precipitation data from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation
with Station Data (CHIRPS), with drought defined as <15% of the average rainfall from 1981
to 2016. The association between drought and risk behaviors as well as HIV-related out-
comes was assessed using logistic regression, incorporating complex survey weights. Anal-
yses were stratified by age, sex, and geography (urban versus rural). All of Lesotho suffered
from reduced rainfall, with regions receiving 1%–36% of their historical rainfall. Of the
12,887 interviewed participants, 93.5% (12,052) lived in areas that experienced drought,
with the majority in rural areas (7,281 versus 4,771 in urban areas). Of the 835 adults living
in areas without drought, 520 were in rural areas and 315 in urban. Among females 15–19
years old, living in a rural drought area was associated with early sexual debut (odds ratio
[OR] 3.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43–6.74, p = 0.004), and higher HIV prevalence
(OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.19–6.47, p = 0.02). It was also associated with lower educational
attainment in rural females ages 15–24 years (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.25–0.78, p = 0.005).

 Multivariable analysis adjusting for household wealth and sexual behavior showed that
experiencing drought increased the odds of HIV infection among females 15–24 years old
(adjusted OR [aOR] 1.80, 95% CI 0.96–3.39, p = 0.07), although this was not statistically
significant. Migration was associated with 2-fold higher odds of HIV infection in young peo-
ple (aOR 2.06, 95% CI 1.25–3.40, p = 0.006). The study was limited by the extensiveness of
the drought and the small number of participants in the comparison group.
Conclusions
Drought in Lesotho was associated with higher HIV prevalence in girls 15–19 years old in
rural areas and with lower educational attainment and riskier sexual behavior in rural
females 15–24 years old. Policy-makers may consider adopting potential mechanisms to
mitigate the impact of income shock from natural disasters on populations vulnerable to HIV
transmission.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Periods of climate extremes have been shown to lead to increases in high-risk behaviors,
particularly in agricultural communities dependent on rainfall for their livelihoods.
• Prior studies have linked these increases in riskier sexual behaviors, such as extramarital
partnerships and transactional sex, to increases in HIV acquisition.
• The Lesotho Population-Based HIV Impact Assessment, a national HIV survey con-
ducted from November 2016 to May 2017 following a 2-year severe drought in southern
Africa, allowed us to reevaluate this relationship in the setting of expanded antiretroviral
use.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We paired geospatial data on accumulated rainfall from 2014 to 2016 with data from the
survey to determine if there were any associations between drought and HIV outcomes.
• A total of 12,887 adults ages 15–59 years completed a detailed questionnaire, and 11,682
underwent an HIV test.
• Adolescent girls and young women ages 15–24 years in rural areas of drought had
higher rates of high-risk behaviors, such as early sexual debut and transactional sex, and
had lower educational attainment.
• Living in a drought area appeared to be associated with greater HIV prevalence in
young females and was associated with a lower HIV prevalence in young males.
• However, external migration, commonly seen during these periods, was associated with
a greater prevalence of HIV in men and women.

 What do these findings mean?
• Future policy on mitigation of climate change in southern Africa may consider includ-
ing HIV prevention interventions in populations at high risk. This could include preex-
posure prophylaxis (PrEP) for migrants and young women in areas of severe food
insecurity.
• Likewise, HIV programs that provide social and economic support to young women as
part of an HIV prevention strategy should consider targeting areas affected by drought.
• Further studies should be done in other settings to investigate the external validity of
these findings, particularly in terms of the impact on HIV in young women.
Introduction
The impact of climate change on human health is becoming increasingly evident. Aside from
changes in infectious disease transmission directly related to disturbances favoring multiplica-
tion of disease vectors, periods of climate extremes are often associated with changes in behav-
ior as people struggle to survive in the face of loss of agricultural production [1,2]. As people,
particularly women, address their food insecurity, they may be less likely to take steps to pro-
tect themselves from HIV infection [3,4], and studies have documented increases in HIV
infections during drought-related famine periods in Africa [5,6]. A previous study of 21
Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) across 19 countries in sub-Saharan Africa from 2003
to 2009 demonstrated that recurrent rainfall shocks were likely responsible for approximately
11% of HIV infections because of negative income shocks, particularly in high-prevalence
countries and predominantly agrarian societies [6]. There is also concern that food insecurity
could lead to decreased access to antiretrovirals (ARVs) because of economic constraints or
decreased adherence or absorption of ARVs [7–9], with a subsequent increase in community
viral load, drug resistance, and HIV transmission [10–13]. Despite the increased frequency
and severity of droughts in the Sahel and southern Africa, few countries’ climate change adap-
tation policies currently include any intensified efforts for HIV prevention during climate-
related events [14].
Southern Africa experienced 2 years of an El Nino–induced regional drought during the
growing seasons of 2014–2015, including during key stages of crop development, leading to
food shortages in 2016 and increased food costs for almost 40 million people in the region
[15]. In Lesotho, where 55% of the population grow their own food, most people survive on
rain-fed subsistence farming [16]. The drought led to a 67% reduction in maize production,
with almost 25% of the population requiring emergency food assistance by August 2016 [16].
Lesotho also has a long tradition of labor migration to South Africa, and during periods of
drought, migration increases, particularly from predominantly rural districts [16–18]. Further-
more, Lesotho is a country with a hyperendemic HIV epidemic, with prevalence above 25% in
the adult population, and therefore is at greater risk of disruption to any improvements in epi-
demic control [3,19].
The Lesotho Population-Based HIV Impact Assessment (LePHIA) was a national survey
conducted from November 2016 to May 2017 in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with funding from the President’s Emergency
Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). LePHIA examined the status of the HIV epidemic in Lesotho

 by measuring HIV prevalence, incidence, and viral load suppression (VLS). This study used
LePHIA data to assess whether people living in areas most severely affected by the drought had
higher HIV prevalence or changes in risk behaviors and whether there was any difference in
the continuum of care among people living with HIV (PLHIV). The analysis additionally dis-
aggregates by age band to examine the outcomes in youth and older people [19,20].
Methods
Survey design and participants
LePHIA employed a two-stage sampling design to select a nationally representative sample of
adults and children aged 0–59 years in 418 enumeration areas (EAs) across all 10 districts. The
sample size was powered on a relative standard error of 30% for incidence of HIV in adoles-
cent girls and young women (AGYW). Consenting heads of household completed a household
questionnaire, including a roster of all household members who resided in or had slept in the
household the previous night. These individuals then consented to a questionnaire on sociode-
mographic and behavioral factors (S1 Text) and to home-based HIV testing. A guardian or
parent provided permission to approach 10-to-17-year-olds who were then asked for assent
for all procedures. The adult questionnaire was administered to participants aged 15–59. Writ-
ten informed consent was documented at each stage via electronic signature. All participants
provided written consent. The LePHIA protocol and data collection tools were approved by
the Lesotho Research and Ethics Committee, the institutional review boards at Columbia Uni-
versity Medical Center (#AAAQ8537), and the United States Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
Procedures
Survey staff administered the household and the adult questionnaires during a face-to-face
interview with participants using Google Nexus 9 tablets. The household questionnaire col-
lected data on household assets and access to food. The adult questionnaire included questions
on lifetime and recent sexual behaviors, as well as questions on the HIV continuum of care for
those who reported being HIV positive. Only one female participant aged 15 years or older in
each household was randomly selected to answer questions about experiences with sexual vio-
lence, to mask the nature of the questions to other members of the household. Any female
younger than 18 who reported being sexually exploited was referred to support services for
counseling and further management.
Rapid HIV testing was conducted using point-of-care (POC) tests—Determine HIV-1/2
Rapid Test (Alere)—and confirmed with a Uni-Gold HIV Test (Trinity Biotech), as per the
national algorithm. Laboratory verification of all HIV-positive results was done using the Gee-
nius HIV-1/2 Supplemental Assay (Bio-Rad). Viral load testing was done preferentially on
plasma, or on dried blood spots (DBSs) if necessary, at a central lab on an automated platform.
Drought measurement
Drought was quantified using precipitation estimates from the Climate Hazards Group Infra-
Red Precipitation with Station Data (CHIRPS), which blends a variety of satellite imagery with
interpolated weather station data to create gridded rainfall estimates at dekadal time-step and
0.05˚ resolution, or approximately 30 km2 [21]. To capture the multiseason impact of El Nino,
the 2-year total rainfall from June 2014 to May 2016 was summed and then ranked among all
2-year rainfall amounts within the 1981–2016 period and converted to an empirical percentile;
therefore, a value of 1% signifies the driest 2-year period in the 35-year record, 100% signifies

 the wettest, and 50% signifies close to the median value. By using the rainfall accumulation
over a 24-month period, the accumulation of data decreased the relative importance of errors
in rainfall measurement. Use of these biennial deviations also ensured that any observed nega-
tive income shock for that period was a reflection of deviations from the norm, rather than a
continuation of underlying farmers’ long-term adjustments to declining precipitation levels
[21]. This gridded dataset was prepared by the Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (VAM)
Geospatial Analysis Team at the Analysis and Trends Service of the World Food Programme
(WFP), using scripts developed in-house.
Latitude and longitude data from the centroid of each LePHIA-sampled EA were overlaid
on the gridded rainfall dataset, with all individuals within each gridded area assigned the same
level of rainfall, using ArcGIS Pro 2.0.1 (ESRI). Drought was defined at a percentile of 15% or
lower of the historical record in order to generate a binary variable that approximates the level
below which rainfall deficits are particularly harmful to gross domestic product (GDP) and
maize yields [6]. This translates into the 2-year period being one of the five driest periods dur-
ing the 35-year historical record.
Statistical analysis
The effect of the drought was examined on recent behavior (over the past 12 months), HIV
prevalence, and the continuum of HIV care at the individual level, using weighted data for all
analyses, per an a priori analysis plan (S1 Analysis Plan). Commercial and forced sex were life-
time measures because of the smaller number of respondents. Design weights were calculated
based on sampling design, including probability of household selection, and adjusted for non-
response at the household, individual, and biomarker level using the Chi-Squared Automatic
Interactor Detector (SI-CHAID) software (Statistical Innovations); this was stratified by urban
or rural residence, age group, and region, with peri-urban populations grouped with rural as
per the Lesotho Bureau of Statistics. Poststratification weights were calculated to reflect the age
distribution of the 2016 Lesotho census. Additional weights were used for the subsample of
women replying to the sexual violence questions. A household wealth quintile was generated
using principal components analysis of household assets to generate a wealth score, based on
the previously described methodology used in the DHS [22]. Poverty was defined as a house-
hold living in the lowest two quintiles. All analyses were done in Stata version 15.1 using
weighted data, with Jackknife replicate weights used for variance estimation.
We used logistic regression to assess the association of drought with individual-level likeli-
hood of infection as a binary variable, stratified by region and gender, based on prior data indi-
cating that income shock differentially impacts males versus females [20,23], as does urban
versus rural location [6]. The analysis was stratified by age to highlight the 15-to-24-year-olds
and, where numbers allowed, into adolescents (aged 15–19 years) versus young adults (aged
20–24 years) to identify those most likely to have been recently infected. We examined the
association with behaviors associated with HIV acquisition, such as recent condom use, com-
mercial sex [24], and migration [25]; in young people for whom the drought would be most
likely to affect recent transitions, we also examined associations with educational attainment
[24], transactional and intergenerational sex (sexual partner who was 10 or more years older),
and early sex and marriage in 15-to-19-year-olds [26,27]. Transactional sex was defined as
nonmarital, noncommercial sex entered into on the assumption of material benefits [28]. Edu-
cational attainment was defined as whether they had attended secondary school or greater and
did not require completion. Food insecurity was defined as any 24-hour period without food
to eat because of lack of resources in the past 4 weeks. To assess drought and the treatment cas-
cade, we assessed the association of drought with awareness of HIV status, reported ARV

 therapy (ART) use, and VLS, defined as HIV RNA < 1,000 copies/ml in PLHIV. Note that the
planned investigation of the association of drought with recent infection was not performed
because of the small number of recent cases identified in LePHIA.
A multivariable logistic regression model of the association of drought with HIV prevalence
was constructed according to a UNAIDS hierarchical framework linking environmental disas-
ters to population displacement, poverty, and behavioral change [3] and included variables
known to be associated with HIV infection—namely, age and household economic status—or
to be independently associated with drought in univariable analysis with a p-value < 0.10 and
plausibly associated with HIV infection. Because there appeared to be opposite patterns of
association between drought and HIV prevalence by sex, we fitted the model with an interac-
tive variable combining drought and sex, with participants living without drought coded as 0,
males living in drought coded as 1, and females living in drought coded as 2.
Because of the multiple comparisons included in this study, we used the Benjamini-Hoch-
berg method to adjust the probabilities for the chance of a false positive [29]. For this calcula-
tion, we obtained the false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected p-value for each hypothesis and for
each strata of analysis—for instance, including all univariable analyses conducted to assess the
associations between drought and behavior in rural females. We used an acceptable level of
false positives of 5% and report significance based on the corrected p-value, with a corrected p-
value of 0.10 considered weak evidence of an association. For the multivariable analysis, we
used a significance threshold of 0.025 based on the Bonferroni correction of adjusting the nor-
mal p-value of 0.05 to reflect the two models.
Results
Of 9,403 selected households, 8,824 (94%) completed a household interview; 9% of households
in rural areas were vacant, compared to 6% of urban households. Of 7,893 eligible women and
6,135 eligible men, 12,887 (92%) completed an interview, and 11,682 of those (91%) were
tested for HIV. The vast majority of households (94.8% of urban and 93.9% of rural) were in
areas of drought (Fig 1). There was no difference in the sex ratio in drought versus nondrought
areas, nor was there a difference in age distribution (Table 1). Compared to all urban residents
and those living in rural nondrought areas, a greater proportion of participants in rural
drought-affected areas were in impoverished (55.3%) and food-insecure households (39.6%).
In univariable analysis, both males and females residing in rural drought-affected areas
were more likely to be poor, with the greatest effect on females, who had 4-fold higher odds of
being members of impoverished households (odds ratio [OR] 4.22, 95% confidence interval
[CI] 2.34–7.62, p < 0.001; Table 2). Among females residing in urban areas, drought was asso-
ciated with an almost 5-fold increase in the odds of selling sex (OR 4.86, 95% CI 2.20–10.72,
p < 0.001) and a 3-fold increase in the odds of having experienced forced sex (OR 3.11, 95%
CI 1.42–6.85, p = 0.005). Among rural females, drought was associated with a reduction in
condom use (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54–0.92, p = 0.01). Among males, there was weak evidence
that living in rural drought-affected areas increased the odds of migration (OR 1.76, 95% CI
0.94–3.30, p = 0.08); this was not significant after FDR correction.
For young females living in a rural drought-affected area, there was an association with
lower proportions attending secondary education (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.25–0.78, p = 0.005), as
well as a 3-fold increase in transactional sex (OR 3.26, 95% CI 1.78–5.98, p < 0.001). Among
15-to-19-year-olds, girls had increased odds of early sexual debut (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.43–6.74,
p = 0.004).
HIV prevalence was 26.9% (95% CI 25.4–33.4%) in urban areas and 24.7% (95% CI 23.5–
25.8%) in rural areas and was higher in females (Table 3). Although the association was only

 significant at p < 0.10 after FDR correction, female adolescents living in drought-affected
areas had almost 3-fold higher odds of HIV infection (OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.19–6.47, p = 0.02)
compared to their counterparts in rural areas without drought. This association was weaker

 among girls living in urban drought areas (OR 1.84, 95% CI 0.94–3.62, p = 0.08), again com-
pared to their counterparts in urban areas without drought.
In terms of the treatment cascade (Table 3), drought was not associated with awareness of
status, reported ART use, or VLS among all PLHIV, aside from in young women in urban set-
tings, for whom there was weak evidence of lower awareness of HIV-positive status (OR 0.23,
95% CI 0.08–0.70, p = 0.01).
In the multivariable analysis, after adjusting for age and economic, marital, and educational
status as well as recent sexual behavior, there was a protective effect of drought noted for
young males in terms of HIV infection (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.35, 95% CI 0.17–0.72, p = 0.006)
and weak evidence of higher odds of HIV infection in young females (aOR 1.80, 95% CI 0.96–
3.39, p = 0.07; Table 4). Recent migration, marital status, and intergenerational sex in the past
year had the strongest associations with HIV in young people. In older people, there was no
association between drought and HIV infection, but HIV infection was associated with food
insecurity; being married; and reporting intergenerational, transactional, or commercial sex in
the past year, whereas condom use at last sex was not protective. Higher educational attain-
ment was protective in all ages.

 Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study of the association of drought with HIV infection in
the era of expanded use of ART [19]. In times of drought, it is expected that families will
adopt extraordinary measures to ensure that they can secure food, potentially including
such non-agricultural sources of income as casual labor, domestic service, and alternative
forms of sex work. The LePHIA survey provided an opportunity to assess coping mecha-
nisms that might have been adopted in the 12 months prior to the survey, during times of
crop failure and hunger.
The findings from our study suggest a drought response pattern including alteration of
behaviors increasing risk [6]. The observed associations were stronger in rural areas, where
food shortages and income shocks would be most pronounced because of limited diversifica-
tion of economic activity. They are consistent with other results from LePHIA, which found
some association between food insecurity and incident infection in AGYW. Moreover, we
found that there was an increase in the constellation of risk behaviors that were independently
associated with HIV infection, including transactional and commercial sex, suggesting that
some women may indeed be relying on sexual favors to survive drought, if less openly in rural
areas than in urban [20,30]. The increase in early sexual debut and reduced educational

 attainment in girls in rural areas is consistent with adolescent girls being removed from school
for transactional partnerships or marriage so that families can benefit from the bride price
[31]. The strength of the association between marriage and HIV infection suggests that there
may be relatively high rates of transmission between married couples, either through infec-
tions developed prior to marriage or through infections acquired from extramarital partners.
For women in urban areas, despite an attenuated effect of the drought on household pov-
erty, being in a drought-affected region was associated with substantially higher reporting of
commercial and coercive sex, which supports results from a recent United Nations Popula-
tions Fund survey in Lesotho linking drought to an increase in gender-based violence [32].
This is indicative of increased vulnerability, potentially reflective of internal migration from
rural areas seeking employment, and of global disruption of the economy due to the severity of
drought and impact on other sectors [33,34]. As 48% of women reporting a history of com-
mercial sex work in Lesotho are HIV positive, and forced sex also increases the risk of HIV
[19], the circular migration back to rural homesteads poses significant risk to partners and
communities [35,36]. Furthermore, as education was strongly protective against HIV infection
in our multivariable model, the lower school enrollment seen in young rural females in
drought areas could have far-reaching consequences, in terms of both HIV acquisition and
entrenchment of poverty. Drought clearly has both immediate and long-term consequences
and requires different targeted policies.
Concerning the HIV continuum of care, the results are reassuring in terms of broader epi-
demic control, as there were no observed associations in terms of VLS. There were various
interventions in the form of food support and household rations, including the Super
Cereal from Global Fund and Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food from the WFP, targeting

 malnourished PLHIV on ART or with tuberculosis, and these efforts may have been successful
in incentivizing PLHIV to stay on treatment and in mitigating the worst hunger-associated
effects of the drought. However, the highly migratory nature of the Lesotho population makes
it difficult to interpret the completeness of the data; as those on ART were preferentially pro-
vided with food support [13], stable patients might have been more likely to remain in the
country, with nonadherent or undiagnosed PLHIV not being captured by the survey because
of out-migration.
Study limitations include the ecological nature of the study, which did not measure indica-
tors of the experience of drought at the individual level. However, we were able to demonstrate
that households in rural drought areas were significantly more likely to be impoverished,
which we did not observe in urban areas, supporting the hypothesized impact of drought on
agrarian households. Second, the timing of the survey, which was conducted after the drought,
and its cross-sectional design limit the ability to determine causality for observed associations;
however, the focus on behavior changes in the past year makes it more likely that observed
behaviors occurred during the drought. Social desirability bias may have influenced reporting
of sexual behaviors, although underreporting would be more likely to bias the results toward
the null hypothesis. The severity of the drought also meant that few people were unaffected,
limiting our ability to assess certain outcomes. Furthermore, the drought data were based on
combined satellite and ground station measurement of rainfall, and there were only two
ground stations in Lesotho, which had intermittent functionality during the drought period.
This means that the drought grid was derived primarily from statistical downscaling of satellite
data, impacting the accuracy of estimates at high resolution and allowing for some misclassifi-
cation of drought severity. However, the use of 2 years of data and using relative rank rather
than an absolute value for our indicator of drought should ensure that our results are reason-
ably robust. It should also be noted that the survey only included persons residing in Lesotho;
those who had left and not returned as of the survey date may have influenced HIV transmis-
sion, but we could only observe the association between drought, migration, and HIV infec-
tion among returned migrants. Although there was only weak evidence of an association
between migration and drought for rural males, the multivariable model identified a strong
association between migration and HIV infection in young people. Migration has played a key
role in the epidemic in the region, as male migrants have been reported to engage in commer-
cial sex and have less access to HIV care [25,37,38]. The lower prevalence of HIV in young
men suggests that, in the absence of migration, drought and its attendant financial constraints
might protect men, as it may reduce both incentives and resources to pay for commercial or
transactional sex [20]. Finally, because of the breadth of this analysis, the multiple comparisons
increase the risk of type I errors, which we have tried to limit by using FDR. Some of the
multivariable findings that were marginally significant before the correction become nonsig-
nificant with the application of FDR. In part, this is due to the smaller number of cases once
the data are disaggregated, limiting the statistical power to test multiple associations at once.
Future work with larger samples of young people may enable more fine analyses of causality
and the associations between risk factors. However, the positive and statistically significant
associations between drought and risk behaviors among young women—and between those
behaviors and HIV infection—remain, presenting a plausible and concerning pattern of
vulnerability.
In conclusion, this study provides further evidence for the need for a coordinated policy
and strategy to attenuate the effects of drought on HIV infection in southern Africa. Young
women appear particularly susceptible to the negative income shocks of drought, whereas men
seem predominantly affected in terms of labor migration and its potential for increased long-
term risk [39]. Potential interventions should minimize these shocks by targeting the myriad

 factors contributing to vulnerability and could include cash transfers to encourage families to
keep children in school and avoid early marriage, provided to rural families in times of food
shortage [40,41], and expanded programs for AGYW, sex workers, and migrants, including
preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). In light of the anticipated acceleration of such climatic
extremes, more research is urgently needed on improving resilience of crops to drought to
mitigate the severity of impact on household incomes and public health.
